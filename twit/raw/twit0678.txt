[00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.120]   Club.
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.840]   Universal basic income.
[00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.800]   Is it a good idea or just more BS from Silicon Valley?
[00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.840]   Speaking of which, blockchain seems to be going down.
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.200]   And the surface go, zomping up.
[00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.600]   It's all coming up next on Twit.
[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.880]   [MUSIC PLAYING]

[00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.120]   It's time for Twit this week in tech.
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.080]   Show where we cover the week's tech news.
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.280]   I am so looking-- I say this every week.
[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.400]   It sounds like a broker record.
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.080]   But I am.
[00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.400]   I'm so looking forward to this.
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.200]   My old friend Ed Bott is back from Santa Fe.
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.520]   He's at the ZDNet Ed Bott Report.
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.680]   Is that named after you, Ed?
[00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:17.440]   No, no, no.
[00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.080]   I just inherited it.
[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.840]   There's actually--
[00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.200]   Or 30 Ed Botts.
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.680]   It's like Spencer the Cat, right?
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.200]   That'd be great.
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.200]   That'd be funny.
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.880]   I should start recruiting people to take over from me.
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.040]   You're the next Ed Bott.
[00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.400]   I want to do that with me.
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.000]   I think-- in fact, I think it might have happened.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.760]   They won't tell me.
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.360]   But I believe that this is the fourth clone
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.160]   that's hosted the show over the past intervening decade.
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.720]   But I'm not sure.
[00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.080]   Orphan White.
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.880]   Orphan White.
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.680]   That's right.
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:49.960]   That's right.
[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.600]   There's 18 of us.
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.720]   Also here, ladies and gentlemen, Mr.--
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.360]   Oh, Dr. Uran on Orange background now.
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.680]   Oh, and JJ Stone.
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.520]   I didn't know you could do that.
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.720]   It's reddish, and I can change it.
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.040]   Well, I got to fill up shoe lights.
[00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.160]   I'm on a pro-man master, my domain.
[00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.440]   I don't have to picture up right now,
[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.720]   so you just got colors to deal with.
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.560]   How do you represent my first place?
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.960]   Philly.
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.080]   Philadelphia Phillies.
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.280]   Phillies.
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.120]   The Eagles won last year in the Super Bowl.
[00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.760]   The Phillies going to win the World Series this year, right?
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.200]   If they won the World Series this year,
[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.360]   I'd probably jump off a bridge.
[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.320]   Let's hope they don't win the World Series this year.
[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.920]   It'll be too much.
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:28.800]   Let's just calm down.
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:29.440]   It'll be too much.
[00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.400]   But it can't be that good.
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.280]   Not all the time.
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.880]   Also joining us right now, he's a Clemson fan,
[00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:36.720]   so we won't mention.
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:37.920]   But the color's good, right?
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.400]   That's the right color.
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.320]   Mr. Ant Pruitt.
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:42.400]   First I am.
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.880]   How you doing, Ant from Tech Republic?
[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.360]   Good to see you.
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.840]   Thank you.
[00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:46.600]   Thanks for having me.
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:51.160]   I know Mr. Oh, Dr. was quite ecstatic from Weapon X
[00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.160]   being a Hall of Famer from the Philadelphia Eagles,
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.080]   as well as a Clemson alum, Mr. Brian Dawkins.
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.160]   You guys talking in the sport ball again, right?
[00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:02.240]   Who's the sport ball?
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.200]   There's technology in that.
[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.920]   There's stats and mathematics and addition
[00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.400]   and new helmets and rules and aerodynamics, all kinds of technological warfare
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.640]   going on in sports nowadays.
[00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.720]   Yeah, actually that was a story that even those of us not in Philly
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.760]   heard about because he dragged a bunch of Eagles fans
[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.240]   to the Hall of Fame with him, didn't he?
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.840]   The Hall of Fame always brings everybody out.
[00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.400]   You know everybody comes out and supports.
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.560]   It's a fun night.
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.160]   Guys, it gives speeches and people cry.
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.000]   I love it.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   It's awesome.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.600]   Yeah, it's awesome.
[00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:31.160]   That's nice.
[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.280]   Oh, and his favorite player is Ronnie Lott.
[00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:35.280]   Oh, nice.
[00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.000]   That's your connection out there.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.840]   He gives it up to Ronnie in the greatest safety of all time.
[00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.240]   A further connection you gave my wife a Ronnie Lott jersey.
[00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.880]   Nothing but the best for Lisa.
[00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:47.480]   Nice.
[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:48.680]   Nothing but the best.
[00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.440]   You know what I have?
[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.880]   That was so stupid.
[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.360]   I bought a Colin Kaepernick jersey.
[00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.360]   Oh boy.
[00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.360]   I don't dare wear it.
[00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.040]   You're like, why can't you wear it?
[00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.440]   I'm afraid I get stoned.
[00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.440]   Ah!
[00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:05.240]   I was a fan.
[00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.120]   No, you know what?
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.280]   I remember because I remember the year before--
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:10.880]   actually, it wasn't.
[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:15.960]   It was the pre-season before he got moved up to take over the quarterback
[00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.200]   role of the Niners.
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:21.120]   I watched him in the pre-season, scramble and score a touchdown.
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.800]   I thought, that kid's good.
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.560]   And then, of course, he took us to the Super Bowl.
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.720]   I was very impressed.
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:27.800]   So I bought the jersey.
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.400]   I thought, this guy's a superstar.
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.800]   He's going to be a franchise quarterback.
[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.440]   He's a superstar in his own way.
[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:36.080]   I love him.
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.880]   He sure is.
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:37.560]   I love Colin.
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:38.680]   He still is a superstar.
[00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:39.800]   He still is.
[00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.640]   Maybe even more so.
[00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.720]   Yeah, in a way, he sacrificed his career for his beliefs.
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.800]   So I guess--
[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.280]   if you're not going to wear a sundro over here,
[00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.480]   I'll let the kid wear it.
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:51.360]   Really?
[00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:55.880]   You'd let Alia wear a number seven Kaepernick?
[00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:59.240]   My buddy has an Eagles Kaepernick jersey with the number seven on it.
[00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.440]   He's gangster.
[00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:01.440]   I don't know if I spent him.
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:04.080]   I might have to make one, but it was pretty awesome.
[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:08.640]   She would look like she was wearing a tint if she was--
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:09.480]   Oh, yeah.
[00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:10.000]   No dashing.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.360]   She's grown into it.
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.600]   She still wears my dad's dog in Jersey.
[00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.800]   And it's funny when she was a baby now now, she starts to your legs.
[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:18.640]   So she'll grow into it.
[00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:19.800]   Don't worry about all that.
[00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.560]   Let's get into technology before they skew her.
[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:22.160]   I know.
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:22.560]   Sportball.
[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.480]   And the comments we had quickly.
[00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:26.880]   Technological eyes me something.
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:27.400]   Apple.
[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:27.960]   Apple.
[00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:28.560]   Apple.
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:29.400]   Record order.
[00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:30.920]   Very good.
[00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:36.400]   A trillion dollar company, the first to be worth $1 trillion
[00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:40.880]   in the United States of America, even worth more.
[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:42.480]   My favorite stat, that's the New York Times.
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:43.920]   You could click the start button on that.
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:46.400]   If you're watching the video, this is a really great
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:47.880]   animated infographic.
[00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:48.560]   The New York Times did.
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:51.720]   My favorite factoid from all of that
[00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:55.760]   is that Apple is now worth more than the entire United
[00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:00.440]   States media industry, all the TV, all the radio,
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:04.280]   throw in Disney, Comcast, throw them all in.
[00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:08.640]   They don't add up to $1 trillion.
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:10.720]   Does it mean anything at all to anybody?
[00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:11.440]   It's just a number.
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:12.720]   It's four commas.
[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:15.680]   Who's starting with?
[00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.400]   Ed bot.
[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:18.400]   Oh, God.
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.720]   And that's why I started with you, Ed.
[00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:24.200]   Yes.
[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:30.480]   You know, market capitalization is such a distortion
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:35.360]   of everything these days.
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:38.760]   There's a handful of big companies
[00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:42.720]   that have basically having money funneled into them
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:49.040]   in ways that remind me very much of 1999 and 2008.
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:51.240]   You think it's bubble time?
[00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:53.160]   Well, who knows?
[00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:57.640]   If I knew that, I'd be a billionaire.
[00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:01.240]   But it sure reminds me of that time.
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:04.760]   And we already saw a little inkling
[00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:09.040]   of what can happen when things turn on a company
[00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:12.120]   with what happened to Facebook just two weeks ago,
[00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:16.320]   losing $120 billion of their market cap in one day.
[00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:20.320]   I don't think Apple is in any danger of having that happen
[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:22.360]   to them because they have no problem.
[00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:25.520]   Let's ask this question.
[00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:28.000]   Is Apple being worth a trillion and have
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.520]   this big bump in its stock price?
[00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:35.720]   That important to Apple compared to Facebook losing $120 billion
[00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:37.240]   in its market cap.
[00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:39.800]   Does market cap have-- it doesn't mean the company's
[00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:41.400]   got more money.
[00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:44.280]   It means there's more value in the shares.
[00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:46.480]   That's all right.
[00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:46.960]   Yeah.
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:48.160]   It's just value.
[00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:49.720]   I don't think it's--
[00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:52.240]   I look at it more as like monopoly money.
[00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:54.960]   It doesn't really mean anything until you don't have any.
[00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:59.280]   I guess, though, for morale purposes, it matters.
[00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:01.800]   Your employees who probably have stock options
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:04.560]   are paying attention to this, unfortunately.
[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:08.880]   So when it comes to tech and the stock market,
[00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:12.920]   it's such a scam because they don't evaluate technology
[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:14.440]   the way they do other markets.
[00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:17.520]   It's not like oil and gas and things like that.
[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:21.360]   It's just on how they feel when they want to make free money.
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:23.960]   Facebook does what it's supposed to do,
[00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:25.440]   and then they tank Facebook.
[00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:29.200]   And thanks to Jimmy Christmas that losing $15 billion
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:31.280]   doesn't make Zuckerberg jump out of a window,
[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:35.040]   just shows you how much real money he actually has that he's
[00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:36.240]   like, OK, whatever.
[00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:37.720]   But he was doing the right thing,
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:40.120]   and the market doesn't reflect that because they want
[00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:42.880]   you to keep being corrupt and making free money
[00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:44.400]   on top of money on top of money.
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:47.120]   And so I'm saying, hey, that's a just and pivot
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:51.280]   and keep growing and have trust in our company and our brand.
[00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:53.640]   The stock market is such a scam.
[00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:54.240]   It's ridiculous.
[00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:57.480]   And then being worth a trillion dollars, whoop-de-do.
[00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:57.980]   OK.
[00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:01.220]   They're selling every time I look at one of the markets,
[00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:04.000]   it's in the global scale of things.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.820]   They're losing shares to other phones, other devices,
[00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:08.920]   and other things.
[00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:12.280]   They personally can't get their own media content correct.
[00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:14.360]   Their music streaming is down.
[00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:16.800]   So again, all the things I look at in general,
[00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:19.440]   I'm like, sure, keep fluffing up that number
[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:22.460]   and giving somebody money until you rip everybody off.
[00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:24.300]   So bubble or bust or whatever it is.
[00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:26.780]   Then making a trillion dollars, cookies to them,
[00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:30.980]   shame on me for not putting my $100 in back in 1996.
[00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:32.160]   All right, let's play a game.
[00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:33.840]   You probably already know the answer to this,
[00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:35.120]   all of you, because you covered this.
[00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:39.320]   But number one, phone manufacturer, this quarter.
[00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:40.840]   Who sold the most phones this quarter?
[00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:42.160]   Was it Apple?
[00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:42.480]   Samsung.
[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:43.320]   My way.
[00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:44.840]   Samsung.
[00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:46.120]   Huawei.
[00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:47.720]   Number two.
[00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:48.320]   There it is.
[00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:49.200]   Number two.
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:51.120]   Number two.
[00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:52.240]   Apple.
[00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:54.200]   Number three.
[00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:56.680]   So you could talk about Apple's stock price,
[00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:59.500]   which easily beats Samsung's market value
[00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:01.700]   and Huawei's market value.
[00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:06.100]   But if what you're talking about is how many phones
[00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:07.300]   you sold.
[00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:08.860]   You need pricing.
[00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:10.060]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:11.820]   Apple's phones cost a little more, don't they?
[00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:13.220]   Not much more than the Samsung.
[00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:14.220]   Probably a lot more than the Huawei.
[00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:15.300]   I bet much more than the Samsung.
[00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:16.540]   Yeah.
[00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:19.140]   And again, Apple does everything.
[00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:21.260]   And everything in Apple matters on how you feel.
[00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.980]   They make you feel like you have a gold laptop in your lap.
[00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:26.640]   You know, it's a piece of crap without a touchscreen
[00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:27.780]   or SD card reader.
[00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:29.340]   And they tell you it's a super pro.
[00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:30.540]   Why have you got me rained about Apple?
[00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:32.220]   This is going to be the Apple show.
[00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:33.540]   No, stop it.
[00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:34.900]   I'm always any Apple.
[00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:36.380]   I'm so sweet.
[00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:37.940]   I only have-- I got my phone left.
[00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:39.900]   And I got this Mac mini left.
[00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:41.020]   And I'm slowly getting the way.
[00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:42.020]   Are you fading away?
[00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:42.780]   Are you fading away?
[00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:43.180]   Really?
[00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:45.100]   Trying to get all the crack cocaine and heroin.
[00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:46.180]   Uncle Leo is hard.
[00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:48.500]   And Ed Boggs always been a Windows guy, right?
[00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:51.260]   Ed, you got-- you know, you like it.
[00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:55.740]   I try to be ecumenical about these things.
[00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:58.100]   One thing that I thought of, though, first of all,
[00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:02.580]   in your ranking of the companies, that's by unit sales.
[00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:06.020]   If you look at profit, the numbers
[00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:07.700]   are very different.
[00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:10.020]   Apple's margins are insane.
[00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:12.420]   And they're capturing what is it?
[00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:16.980]   80%, 90% of all the profit in the entire smartphone market.
[00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:21.500]   But thinking back on the whole trillion dollar valuation
[00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:24.900]   reminds me of Amazon's journey.
[00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:27.620]   Amazon is second largest company.
[00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:29.100]   They're right up there.
[00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:31.380]   Yeah, all of these companies are close to a trillion.
[00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:33.700]   Google, Amazon, Microsoft--
[00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:34.200]   Right.
[00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:36.460]   --probably will all hit a trillion at some point.
[00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:41.460]   But for years, Amazon would--
[00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:49.500]   they'd report insane big increases in revenue and no profit.
[00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:52.780]   One half percent or even a tiny loss.
[00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:55.900]   They'd always manage their expenditures.
[00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:58.180]   So every bit of profit that they were making,
[00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:00.100]   they were plowing back into the business.
[00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:02.940]   And now, just in the last two years or so,
[00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:06.820]   you're starting to see all of that stuff pay off for them.
[00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:11.340]   And that, to me, is more of the model of what
[00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:13.820]   to look for in a successful company.
[00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:16.980]   Amazon was saying, screw the quarterly results,
[00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:23.100]   screw the analysts who say you need to be paying a dividend
[00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:28.820]   or you need to be showing 5% or 10% profit each quarter.
[00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:30.900]   They were plowing it back into the business.
[00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:34.260]   And the funny thing is that where they are making all
[00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:41.500]   of that money now is on Amazon Web Services, AWS.
[00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:43.220]   That's where they--
[00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:47.380]   while everyone was looking at Amazon, the big e-commerce site,
[00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:52.540]   they were stealthily building this juggernaut of a business
[00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:56.940]   that is, in turn, running the rest of the internet.
[00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:59.540]   If you buy Amazon stock, you're buying--
[00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:01.300]   you're betting on Jeff Bezos, right?
[00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:04.380]   You're saying, I don't know what their business is
[00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:06.180]   or what their business will be.
[00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:09.780]   But I think that that big wallet that Jeff Bezos is carrying
[00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:11.620]   around will be put to good use.
[00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:14.260]   He looks like he's going to get in the pharmacy business.
[00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.780]   He acquired pill pack.
[00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:20.220]   God knows what drone plans he has.
[00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:22.180]   He certainly looks like he's getting in the position.
[00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:24.140]   He wants to do health care.
[00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:27.300]   He's gotten together with JP Morgan and Berkshire Hathaway
[00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:30.380]   to do something that looks like it's Amazon health care
[00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:31.380]   for employees.
[00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:35.580]   But obviously, the next step is, you know,
[00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:37.220]   we might have single payer in the United States
[00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:40.380]   brought to you by Amazon.com.
[00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:43.140]   I said to health care by Amazon, maybe they should get
[00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:45.260]   like a 20-minute bathroom break.
[00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.740]   I said I haven't run all the way across the factory
[00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:50.100]   and take two minutes in the bathroom and not make it back
[00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:54.260]   in time and get punished for their 15-minute break.
[00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.220]   The working conditions there, I have a lot of friends.
[00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:57.740]   There's a local hub around here.
[00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:00.620]   And so many of my friends cycle in and out.
[00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:03.140]   So I, you know, drive me through the car.
[00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:08.180]   - All right, let me play the evil capitalist for a moment.
[00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:12.340]   And you can shoot at me, oh, doctor.
[00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:13.860]   - They take the job.
[00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:16.300]   If you don't like the job, quit, get a different job.
[00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:19.260]   So they do take the job.
[00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:20.100]   - Right?
[00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:21.300]   - And they do the minimum wage.
[00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:23.060]   - It's legal.
[00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:25.500]   - It's more than minimum wage and it is legal.
[00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:30.300]   But it's also for a company that is automated
[00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:34.580]   and so down to the wire and here's the bottom line.
[00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:36.620]   When that man sits on TV in the way he talks
[00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:39.140]   about his employees versus the way they treat employees,
[00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:40.140]   that's the other problem with it.
[00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:42.500]   If you wanna be a slumlord, go ahead and be a slumlord.
[00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:43.620]   But don't tell me that I'm living
[00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:45.460]   in an luxury apartment in the sky.
[00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:46.740]   And yes, those people can quit.
[00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:49.980]   And most of those people do quit because they can't handle it.
[00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:51.780]   But a lot of people need a job.
[00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:53.980]   There's only so many jobs per area.
[00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:56.540]   And that place has a farm system for work.
[00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:58.260]   So yes, you're absolutely right.
[00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:00.020]   They have the right to quit.
[00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:02.180]   They can get their little 10, 15 hour.
[00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:05.020]   They'll get there four hours a night or 12 hours
[00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:07.340]   or 60 hours or whatever it is.
[00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:09.260]   But again, when you're talking about healthcare
[00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:10.980]   and when you sit on TV and tell me
[00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:12.860]   how your working conditions are great.
[00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:15.420]   And I'm telling you that a person on the floor
[00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:18.340]   putting stuff in your box gets a 15 minute break
[00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:19.420]   and if they had to go to the bathroom
[00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:22.260]   by the time they get all the way over to the bathrooms,
[00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:24.580]   it's already eight minutes and they've got to be back
[00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:26.380]   and it was 15 minutes or to get ridden up
[00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:28.820]   and get ridden up three times, you're out.
[00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:30.260]   And that's just for going to the bathroom.
[00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:31.620]   Let alone your half hour lunch break.
[00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:34.780]   So the work conditions there aren't spectacular
[00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:35.660]   if you're on the ground.
[00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:39.420]   I got another buddy who does a website work for them.
[00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:40.260]   He works from home.
[00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:42.460]   He's getting paid a mint living in Seattle, Watson
[00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:44.260]   and he's balling out of control,
[00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:45.620]   typing away on his computer.
[00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:46.460]   - But that's the way it should be.
[00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:49.180]   He has a high level of skills.
[00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:54.020]   He's doing something that is a difficult and a rare job.
[00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:56.180]   Anybody can be a warehouse worker.
[00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:58.420]   They're getting paid commensurate to their value
[00:16:58.420 --> 00:16:59.420]   to the company.
[00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:01.220]   Again, I understand.
[00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:02.620]   I'm being the evil capitalist.
[00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:04.340]   - Oh no, no, no, I feel like I'm not yelling at you.
[00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:06.100]   I'm saying you're right, they're getting paid
[00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:07.340]   for what they're doing.
[00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:11.220]   I'm just saying that there needs to be more humanity
[00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:14.420]   in those lower end jobs where the bulk and the back
[00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:18.100]   and the workforce is the lifeblood of your business.
[00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:19.700]   - Is that what you were gonna be trying to do?
[00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:23.860]   - He's a Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Tim Cooks.
[00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:27.220]   Is it their responsibility to look at Google now
[00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:28.260]   as getting a lot of heat?
[00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:30.020]   Apparently, this is a rumor.
[00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:32.940]   They're preparing a censored version of Google search
[00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:36.540]   for China, the authoritarian regime that Sergey Brin
[00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:40.860]   pulled out of when China started to assert
[00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:42.580]   it's authoritarianism.
[00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:44.060]   But apparently they want to go back in.
[00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:45.620]   Google employs a very upset.
[00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:50.340]   Is it the responsibility of these CEOs to be human
[00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:54.260]   or is it their responsibility to be profitable?
[00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:55.940]   Isn't that their job?
[00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:57.620]   - It's a balance.
[00:17:57.620 --> 00:17:59.140]   It's a balance now that you should do things.
[00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:00.380]   And again, it's how you talk.
[00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:02.620]   When you sit there and tell me, I'm gonna say it again.
[00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:04.860]   When you're on national TV talking about those people
[00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:06.900]   in the warehouse and you talk about all the great things
[00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:07.740]   they have living on.
[00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:10.580]   - You think it'd be okay if Jeff Bezos was the evil genius
[00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:12.140]   rubbing his hands in glee.
[00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:14.420]   If he were Scrooge and McDuck saying,
[00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:16.460]   "I'm rich, I'm the richest man in the world."
[00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:17.940]   Screw those employees.
[00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:19.820]   Then it would be okay.
[00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:22.500]   - At least to be honest, I mean, I'm not saying it'd be okay.
[00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:23.500]   It's not okay to wait.
[00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:24.340]   - Exactly.
[00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:25.900]   - And bring it up Facebook.
[00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:26.980]   Facebook doesn't sell anything.
[00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:30.340]   They don't have minions in warehouses hitting the lag.
[00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:31.860]   - No, where are they minions?
[00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:33.140]   - No, when it comes to Facebook,
[00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:34.180]   where are the minions?
[00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:37.540]   At least Bezos built a customer centric company.
[00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:38.980]   Bezos could make the argument,
[00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:41.340]   no, we focus on making the customer happy
[00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:43.260]   and the employees work for us.
[00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:45.140]   And that's their job.
[00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:48.020]   - Well, okay, let's back up just a little bit though.
[00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:49.420]   And let's go back to Apple
[00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:53.140]   because Apple has partly the same problem.
[00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:54.820]   - Exactly the same problem.
[00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:58.020]   - The Apple stores, the employees in the Apple stores
[00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:00.900]   are very much in the same boat.
[00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:05.900]   And what you've got is basically a situation
[00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:10.420]   in this country where there's two kinds of workers.
[00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:13.900]   Those who have skills are treated like gods
[00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:18.900]   and those who are working with their bodies
[00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:24.060]   are treated like replaceable cogs that get discarded
[00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:27.900]   as soon as they break or show any signs
[00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:31.940]   of not wanting to be part of the machine.
[00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:36.540]   I would love to see the leaders of one of these companies
[00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:41.180]   show some moral leadership and actually say,
[00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:46.180]   we're going to go beyond what we're required to do.
[00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:50.100]   We really need that.
[00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:54.020]   We really need someone to set a moral example
[00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:56.100]   in terms of the way that they treat workers.
[00:19:56.100 --> 00:20:00.100]   'Cause right now, if you listen to your average stock market
[00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:03.340]   analyst or your average corporate executive
[00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:05.780]   when they're talking about an earnings call,
[00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:08.980]   they treat any increase in wages
[00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:12.020]   or any increase in benefits to employees
[00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:17.020]   as something bad and something to be avoided.
[00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:21.100]   So laying off workers is good.
[00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:23.980]   Cutting salaries is good.
[00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:27.300]   Cutting expenses for workers is good.
[00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:31.700]   And I don't know if that just seems wrong in a country
[00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:35.700]   where a huge portion of the workforce
[00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:38.940]   is capable of using their bodies,
[00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:41.540]   capable of doing good work,
[00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:45.180]   but only able to earn a subsistence wage out of that.
[00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:47.780]   - You said something to start there.
[00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:52.540]   You talked about having a skill versus working with your body.
[00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:55.220]   And I think that's part of the problem right there
[00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:57.460]   is we don't necessarily look at the people
[00:20:57.460 --> 00:21:00.700]   that are running the retail stores as having a skill.
[00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:02.700]   They're selling the product.
[00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:06.180]   At the same time, you could go to corporate sales
[00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:08.700]   and be a rainmaker and make a gazillion dollars.
[00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:11.460]   Sales is sales and sales is a skill.
[00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:15.260]   But for whatever reason, we have our own little perception of,
[00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:18.940]   okay, you're just selling the iPad inside of the store.
[00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:20.460]   You're not really skilled,
[00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:25.460]   but the second you have to sell ads for Apple
[00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:28.380]   or what have you, then that's a skill.
[00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:29.860]   And we have to fix that.
[00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:32.100]   - You and I, Anne have a little dog in this hunt.
[00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:34.740]   You will at some point, oh, doctor, we have kids
[00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:36.700]   who are entering a workplace that is different
[00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:38.380]   from the workplace we entered
[00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:42.820]   and who may be faced with some very difficult choices.
[00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:44.700]   I feel terrible for millennials,
[00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:47.780]   even those coming out of college with skills
[00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:49.700]   because the jobs are disappearing.
[00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:52.380]   Now this brings, I set you guys up.
[00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:54.180]   - Oh, uh-oh.
[00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:55.300]   (laughs)
[00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:57.420]   - Because this brings up something
[00:21:57.420 --> 00:22:00.980]   that is, I think, going to rapidly be a conversation.
[00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:02.900]   Universal basic income.
[00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:04.900]   And I wanna take a little break,
[00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:09.460]   but I wanna talk about what Silicon Valley
[00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:11.220]   seems to like as a solution.
[00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:12.860]   And a guy who's running for president
[00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:15.660]   who says this is the solution.
[00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:17.820]   In Canada, there's been some experiments
[00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:22.100]   that were recently abandoned in UBI.
[00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:23.780]   I'm curious what you guys think about it
[00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:26.260]   'cause I myself don't know what to think about it.
[00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:29.260]   The idea, though, fundamental idea is jobs are disappearing,
[00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:31.860]   the robots are coming, they're taking over.
[00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:33.940]   We better start thinking about what we're gonna do
[00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:36.580]   about real people who can't work.
[00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:40.300]   Even though unemployment is a historic high, right?
[00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:42.380]   Unemployment's very low right now.
[00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:43.220]   - Yeah, it's going down.
[00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:44.380]   - Depends on whose numbers,
[00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:45.780]   depends on whose numbers you check with.
[00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:47.060]   - Yes.
[00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:49.340]   - And if Obama was in office, Trump kept saying,
[00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:50.340]   "I don't believe the numbers."
[00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:51.940]   - I don't know if I believe the numbers currently.
[00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:52.780]   - Now I don't believe the numbers.
[00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:53.620]   - I don't believe the numbers.
[00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:54.460]   - I don't know if I believe the numbers.
[00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:55.980]   - Well, that sounds like a political game.
[00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:57.740]   I'm just curious.
[00:22:57.740 --> 00:22:58.820]   I mean, some of those numbers are people
[00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:00.340]   who are underemployed, some of those people
[00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:02.060]   have stopped looking for work,
[00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:03.740]   so they're not counted as unemployed.
[00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:07.540]   Nevertheless, we doesn't look like there's a crisis
[00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:09.820]   at this point, but maybe one's coming,
[00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:11.140]   and some people are worried about that,
[00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:15.060]   and have a plan which seems maybe to be voodoo economics.
[00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:16.820]   I don't know, I wanna get your guys' opinion.
[00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:17.980]   So I'm gonna give you a minute to take--
[00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:19.140]   - Put your apron on.
[00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:20.420]   - Put my apron on.
[00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:22.740]   Are you cooking?
[00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:25.300]   I wanna know what a doctor's cooking.
[00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:27.660]   We're gonna take a break,
[00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:30.260]   and then the battle, Royale, will begin.
[00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:31.340]   Cage match.
[00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:34.100]   I know, in just a moment.
[00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:35.540]   - Capitalist Cage match.
[00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:36.980]   - The Capitalist Cage match.
[00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:39.860]   You bunch commies, you bunch of commies.
[00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:41.180]   We got Ed bot here.
[00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:43.660]   I like to bait Ed bot, 'cause Ed bot and I basically
[00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:46.660]   are exactly the same politically, but I like to bait you.
[00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:47.500]   He is great.
[00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:49.300]   Ed bot report, ZD net.
[00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:51.940]   Old friend too, it's great to have you on the show.
[00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:54.620]   Oh, doctor, who I dearly love.
[00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:57.140]   He's ready to go off at any moment.
[00:23:57.140 --> 00:23:58.140]   Be careful.
[00:23:58.140 --> 00:24:00.100]   - Any moment.
[00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:01.100]   - Anything could set him off.
[00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:02.780]   Oh, and JJ Stone.
[00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:05.740]   qmz.com.
[00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:09.260]   And you know, the Zen master of the bunch here,
[00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:12.620]   Mr. Ant Pruitt, always calm, always reasonable,
[00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:14.220]   always thoughtful.
[00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:15.700]   - I will say this when I saw it,
[00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:17.340]   I was gonna be on with these gentlemen.
[00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:21.020]   I've never been on with Mr. Bot or Mr. JJ,
[00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:25.420]   the old JJ Stone, and watching his previous appearances
[00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:27.340]   on here, I wanted to be prepared.
[00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:29.980]   So as soon as that rant comes up.
[00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:32.380]   (laughing)
[00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:33.580]   - He's got a bucket.
[00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:36.620]   And popcorn is in the bucket.
[00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:37.460]   All right.
[00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:38.300]   - You got the popcorn.
[00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:39.140]   - Smart man.
[00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:39.980]   - I know it's gonna be a show.
[00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:40.820]   I can't wait for that.
[00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:42.420]   - Get the popcorn ready, kids.
[00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:44.700]   (laughing)
[00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:45.860]   - I need popcorn.
[00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:47.420]   (laughing)
[00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:48.260]   - I love it.
[00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:49.100]   - It's an answer.
[00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:51.420]   - It's done some awful research on you, Owen.
[00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:52.700]   He knows what's coming.
[00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:54.060]   (laughing)
[00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:54.900]   - I thought a little bit.
[00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:55.740]   Does happen.
[00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:57.180]   It does happen.
[00:24:57.180 --> 00:25:00.380]   - Or should they brought to you by sleep?
[00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:01.220]   - Oh man.
[00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:02.140]   You know, the older I get,
[00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:03.460]   the more I appreciate sleep,
[00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:06.620]   and the more I appreciate my Casper mattress,
[00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:07.820]   isn't that a great moment?
[00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:09.100]   Now tell me the truth.
[00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:09.980]   It's been a long day.
[00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:10.820]   You're tired.
[00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:12.260]   You've been working hard.
[00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:13.940]   The kids are driving you crazy.
[00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:15.980]   The job is nuts.
[00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:17.500]   Traffic was terrible.
[00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:19.260]   That moment when you get in bed,
[00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:21.620]   you slide out of the sheets.
[00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:22.780]   It's so magical.
[00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:23.980]   It's so great.
[00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:26.100]   If you have a great mattress,
[00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:27.500]   the worst thing in the world,
[00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:28.860]   and I know 'cause we were on vacation,
[00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:30.860]   and you're getting bed,
[00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:32.300]   it's awful.
[00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:34.380]   It's a terrible mattress.
[00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:35.820]   And you go, "What?
[00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:38.740]   This is my one refuge from life,
[00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:40.100]   and I'm sleeping on this."
[00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:41.900]   No, you need a Casper.
[00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:44.540]   I think I'm gonna send a Casper to that place
[00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:45.940]   we rented at Tahoe.
[00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:46.980]   They need a Casper.
[00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:49.060]   Casper is an online,
[00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:49.980]   let me explain who they are.
[00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:53.180]   They're online retailer premium mattresses.
[00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:54.020]   That might scare you,
[00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:55.780]   "Well, I cannot buy a mattress online.
[00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:56.620]   I got a lie on it."
[00:25:56.620 --> 00:25:58.460]   Well, honestly,
[00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:00.860]   this is where Casper came from.
[00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:04.380]   These guys realized that in the mattress business,
[00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:06.100]   there was a huge problem,
[00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:08.620]   which is the middleman, the mattress store.
[00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:11.380]   They doubled the price of that mattress.
[00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:14.100]   You pay a huge premium
[00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:16.340]   for the simple privilege of going in there
[00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:19.540]   and lying on a mattress in broad daylight,
[00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:22.900]   with the salesperson staring at you,
[00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:24.420]   for three minutes,
[00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:26.060]   you think that helps you decide,
[00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:28.020]   maybe, but you're paying all the big price for it.
[00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:30.900]   So Casper said, "Look, we could take that out of the equation."
[00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:32.700]   Revolutionize a mattress industry
[00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:36.420]   by cutting the cost of dealing with resellers and showrooms,
[00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:38.460]   and then passing that on to you.
[00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:40.380]   But how do we do that?
[00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:41.340]   Well, this is how they do that,
[00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:43.740]   with the 100-day guarantee.
[00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:45.380]   And when you get a Casper mattress,
[00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:48.300]   you have 100 nights to sleep on it.
[00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:49.660]   You don't have to lie down in a showroom.
[00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:51.180]   And if for any reason you don't like it,
[00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:52.180]   they'll come, they'll take it,
[00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:55.780]   and they'll pay you back every penny, no cost.
[00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:56.740]   So that's a great deal.
[00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:58.580]   And by the way, free shipping returns,
[00:26:58.580 --> 00:27:01.700]   not only in the US, but Canada and the UK too.
[00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:03.300]   So the original Casper mattress
[00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:04.020]   is the one we have,
[00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:06.140]   combines multiple supportive memory foams
[00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:09.460]   for a sleep surface that's uncanny,
[00:27:09.460 --> 00:27:10.380]   just the right sink.
[00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:12.620]   So when you get in bed after that tough day, you go,
[00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:13.820]   "Ahh!"
[00:27:13.820 --> 00:27:15.260]   And you just, "Ahh!"
[00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:17.820]   But you don't want to keep sinking.
[00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:19.860]   You want some backbone.
[00:27:19.860 --> 00:27:21.340]   So it's got just the right bounce,
[00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:22.180]   just the firm,
[00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:27.180]   it's the strangest combination of comfort and firmness.
[00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:30.420]   It's breathable, you sleep cool on these hot summer nights.
[00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:31.860]   That's huge.
[00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:33.380]   And we do know that, by the way,
[00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:35.020]   you will sleep better if you can regulate
[00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:37.260]   your temperature through the night.
[00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:40.220]   The Casper mattress, it smells good, it's breathable,
[00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:42.540]   it's comfortable, and you could try it online.
[00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:46.780]   Buy it online and try it completely risk-free in your home.
[00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:48.140]   This is the mattress you want.
[00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:50.740]   There's actually now more than the original Casper.
[00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:52.780]   They've expanded.
[00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:54.260]   I just want you to go to Casper,
[00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:57.220]   C-A-S-P-E-R.com/Twit.
[00:27:57.220 --> 00:27:59.060]   When you use the offer code "Twit",
[00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:02.300]   you could save $50 on select mattresses.

[00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:09.100]   And that's, we know more and more important.
[00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:12.620]   I'm telling you, as life goes on, you will realize
[00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:15.340]   there's probably only a handful of things that really matter.
[00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:18.660]   One of them is a great night's sleep on a Casper mattress.
[00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:20.020]   Terms and conditions apply.
[00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:22.780]   Casper.com/Twit, use the promo code "Twit"
[00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:25.500]   for $50 off on select mattresses.
[00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:27.700]   My dad, who's 85, happy birthday,
[00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:30.020]   daddy, two or day five on the 30th,
[00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:31.100]   is all over.
[00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:34.660]   I keep getting email from my dad for this guy, Andrew Yang.
[00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:38.660]   Yang is, he says running for president.
[00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:40.740]   He doesn't have a chance in the world,
[00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:43.820]   but dad liked Bernie Sanders too.
[00:28:43.820 --> 00:28:47.980]   He's the author of a book called "The War on Normal People".
[00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:50.020]   I think this ties right into what we're talking about.
[00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:52.740]   The truth about America's disappearing jobs
[00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:57.700]   and why universal basic income is our future.
[00:28:57.700 --> 00:29:00.340]   And I'm trying to come up with arguments
[00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:03.220]   'cause I'm gonna see dad in a couple of weeks.
[00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:05.820]   Dad, this guy, universal basic income.
[00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:07.100]   It's a non-starter.
[00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:11.620]   Is this, and by the way, Silicon Valley loves this solution.
[00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:13.300]   It lets them off the hook.
[00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:15.940]   Sure, we can make robots, we can take all the jobs
[00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:18.900]   'cause you guys, Yang says we're gonna pay
[00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:21.700]   everybody between the ages of 18 and 65,
[00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:24.700]   a thousand dollars a month, $12,000 a year.
[00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:28.260]   He also believes in single payer, health care.
[00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:29.900]   I don't know how he's gonna pay for this.
[00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:32.020]   I don't know if he knows how he's gonna pay for this.
[00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:34.820]   Is this, Ed, is this the solution that we're looking for?
[00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:37.860]   Well, I actually have a local angle
[00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:40.220]   that I can bring onto this.
[00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:43.620]   I'm, you may not know this,
[00:29:43.620 --> 00:29:46.340]   but my hometown is Stockton, California.
[00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:47.180]   Ah!
[00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:48.580]   That's where I grew up.
[00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:49.420]   I was Stockton.
[00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:50.580]   And the mayor of--
[00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:51.420]   Fat city.
[00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:52.260]   Fat city.
[00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:53.620]   Fat city.
[00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:56.780]   The mayor and ground zero of the housing bubble
[00:29:56.780 --> 00:29:58.300]   10 years ago also.
[00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:03.380]   And the mayor of Stockton is a wonderful,
[00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:06.100]   very smart man named Michael Tubbs.
[00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:09.940]   And Michael Tubbs is, I think he's probably 28
[00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:12.900]   or 29 years old now, and he's the mayor of the city.
[00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:16.500]   My father 40 years ago was the mayor of Stockton.
[00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:19.660]   So there's a, you know, this big connection here.
[00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:23.940]   At any rate, Michael Tubbs is doing a small,
[00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:26.700]   controlled experiment with universal basic income
[00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:28.020]   in Stockton, California.
[00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:29.940]   I haven't kept up on it lately,
[00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:33.180]   but as of about six months ago, that was happening.
[00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:35.580]   And I'm, so, you know, there are some experiments
[00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:37.420]   going on in this country.
[00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:42.420]   And it does seem like a way to eliminate
[00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:47.420]   at least part of the basic, you know,
[00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:50.740]   the sort of core baseline problem,
[00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:54.020]   which is at least give people a chance to
[00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:57.420]   get to a subsistence level.
[00:30:57.420 --> 00:30:58.420]   Yeah, nobody argues that it's a--
[00:30:58.420 --> 00:30:59.300]   Instead of being homeless.
[00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:01.940]   It's a living wage of $500 a month is definitely not.
[00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:03.940]   Even a thousand a month not be.
[00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:06.500]   But it gets you out of deep poverty.
[00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:08.540]   And, you know, one thing I--
[00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:12.180]   And it means that you probably don't have
[00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:15.180]   to live on the street if something happens to you.
[00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:16.380]   Right.
[00:31:16.380 --> 00:31:18.780]   And the one argument against it, which I don't buy,
[00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:20.060]   is, oh, people are lazy.
[00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:22.380]   They'll say, hey, thank you, and they'll never work again.
[00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:24.180]   And nobody's going to do that.
[00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:25.740]   Well, maybe a handful.
[00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:29.260]   Most people, the premise really is,
[00:31:29.260 --> 00:31:32.460]   if you have this kind of safety net,
[00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:33.740]   then you'll take more chances.
[00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:34.580]   You'll work harder.
[00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:38.740]   You'll try, you know, you might take a job
[00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:41.620]   that would be a little more risky and do better as a result.
[00:31:41.620 --> 00:31:44.020]   That's the argument.
[00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:46.140]   They were doing it in Ontario.
[00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:47.740]   They were doing it in Canada in Hamilton,
[00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:50.780]   Brantford, Brant County, Lindsay, and Thunder Bay.
[00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:54.780]   And the new government in Ontario, Rob Ford's brother,
[00:31:54.780 --> 00:31:56.100]   just dumped it completely.
[00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:58.380]   Just what-- that's it.
[00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:00.500]   In fact, you say this page was published under a previous
[00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:01.980]   government.
[00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:05.940]   It is now available for archival and research purposes.
[00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:08.020]   In other words, it's over.
[00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:09.820]   So we don't know what the results are.
[00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:13.780]   But I'm noticing a lot of howls of pain from people who
[00:32:13.780 --> 00:32:15.500]   said this was a success.
[00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:17.580]   This was going to do well.
[00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:19.540]   Owen, you got an opinion on UBI?
[00:32:19.540 --> 00:32:24.700]   Get the popcorn.
[00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:30.220]   It's not a reliable thing.
[00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:34.060]   We have welfare, subsidized housing.
[00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:37.540]   People can barely afford to keep themselves afloat on that.
[00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:39.980]   And again, I know how statistics work,
[00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:41.860]   but in the real world, there's so many people that aren't
[00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:44.580]   counted that aren't working, that are living with family
[00:32:44.580 --> 00:32:48.180]   members and struggling with eyes and jobs.
[00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:51.020]   So tell them you're going to give us my $1,000 a month
[00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:52.700]   when you don't do anything about inflation.
[00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:54.100]   First of all, we don't have any money.
[00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:55.860]   You're telling me you're not in Social Security.
[00:32:55.860 --> 00:32:57.060]   All these other issues that we got,
[00:32:57.060 --> 00:32:59.620]   you're just going to start giving out free money to everybody.
[00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:00.380]   No.
[00:33:00.380 --> 00:33:02.900]   And of course, San Francisco says they want to do that.
[00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:04.980]   At the same time, I really could care less
[00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:07.660]   because we're going to run out of water before a robot
[00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:09.260]   starts taking jobs.
[00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:09.820]   Is there going to be--
[00:33:09.820 --> 00:33:11.420]   Oh, no.
[00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:14.140]   When my pipes break, is there going to be an Android
[00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:15.380]   that comes in here and fixes my pipes?
[00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:16.900]   No, we need plumbers.
[00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:17.740]   We need welders.
[00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:19.380]   We need people to build things.
[00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:21.460]   The things when they say, oh, the robot is taking over.
[00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:22.100]   You know what it is?
[00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:25.420]   It's a little flat Roomba that moves shelves in a warehouse.
[00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:27.340]   It ain't taking over.
[00:33:27.340 --> 00:33:28.900]   It's not taking over.
[00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:31.500]   But again, by the time you see the movie--
[00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:34.500]   Yeah, but really, honestly, how long before--
[00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:37.700]   even those Amazon jobs go away?
[00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:38.540]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:41.460]   I'm like, hey, the people now, raise the wages,
[00:33:41.460 --> 00:33:44.020]   stop doing what Walmart and Amazon does.
[00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:46.700]   We're like, look, you can get 29 and 1/2 hours
[00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:49.140]   so that you're still not a full-time employee,
[00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:50.860]   so you can go get welfare from the government,
[00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:54.060]   let the government subsidize your pay, so I don't have to.
[00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:56.420]   I think you nailed it.
[00:33:56.420 --> 00:33:59.900]   That's exactly why Silicon Valley likes UBIA.
[00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:00.740]   It lets them off the hook.
[00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:01.780]   We could do whatever we want.
[00:34:01.780 --> 00:34:03.300]   B-- oh, good.
[00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:05.700]   We'll make sure everybody's a contract employee
[00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:07.700]   because they're getting the money from the government.
[00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:09.980]   And then we don't have to pay benefits.
[00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:11.580]   It's brilliant.
[00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:13.660]   And again, we're going to run out of money.
[00:34:13.660 --> 00:34:16.220]   I know that this is the world we just print money,
[00:34:16.220 --> 00:34:17.940]   but China, one day, is just going to be like,
[00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:18.340]   you know what?
[00:34:18.340 --> 00:34:19.700]   Just shut the US down.
[00:34:19.700 --> 00:34:21.900]   And they're going to hit the button, put it in code,
[00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:23.980]   L-M-N-O-P, and it shows over.
[00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:24.900]   My TV's done.
[00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:27.460]   I can't get no cell reception because if you don't think
[00:34:27.460 --> 00:34:28.980]   they got a kill switch and everything they
[00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:32.300]   ship over on these boats, you're out of your Miami-Jambie mine.
[00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:34.100]   We owe them so much money already.
[00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:36.020]   So I don't know how this is going to work.
[00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:37.100]   All right.
[00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:41.220]   Your turn, Aunt Pruitt, have you thought about this at all, UBI?
[00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:43.420]   I'm not well versed in it.
[00:34:43.420 --> 00:34:44.540]   Haven't really looked into it.
[00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:46.020]   But the first thing to come to my mind
[00:34:46.020 --> 00:34:49.060]   was we get this stuff rolling.
[00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:51.900]   The prices of just keeping the lights on in the house
[00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:53.820]   will eventually start to go up.
[00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:56.620]   And I'm sure that universal benefit
[00:34:56.620 --> 00:34:59.020]   is not going to go up because the price just
[00:34:59.020 --> 00:35:01.620]   to keep the lights on in the house
[00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:03.340]   is going to go up, not necessarily
[00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:07.020]   saying that everybody can afford air conditioning or things
[00:35:07.020 --> 00:35:11.620]   like that, but just the necessities of light and water.
[00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:13.340]   All of that's going to rise eventually.
[00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:15.340]   It goes up every single year.
[00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:17.380]   There's also the fear that a government that's paying
[00:35:17.380 --> 00:35:19.820]   a UBI, universal basic income, would just then
[00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:21.140]   cut the rest of the entitlements.
[00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:25.060]   UBI, it's estimated it would cost between $1.5 and $2 trillion
[00:35:25.060 --> 00:35:27.060]   a year.
[00:35:27.060 --> 00:35:30.100]   And the entire entitlement budget in the US
[00:35:30.100 --> 00:35:31.980]   is I think $1 trillion.
[00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:34.580]   So this is a big chunk of change.
[00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:35.980]   They're going to have to go somewhere.
[00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:38.340]   Yang says, this scares me too.
[00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:41.700]   Oh, you can pay it with a value added tax.
[00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:46.700]   Charge tax on a national tax on everything on production.
[00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:49.340]   And that scares me as well.
[00:35:49.340 --> 00:35:52.180]   Although we're, I think, one of the last developed nations
[00:35:52.180 --> 00:35:54.980]   not to have a value added tax, right?
[00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:56.860]   - So here's the thing though.
[00:35:56.860 --> 00:36:01.860]   You can't talk about something like this in isolation.
[00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:06.980]   It has to be part of a comprehensive economic plan.
[00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:11.780]   A vision for what you want to do with the populace.
[00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:16.500]   And if you look at the developed world right now,
[00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:20.700]   you're finding a lot of resistance to anything
[00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:24.780]   that smacks of socialism like this.
[00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:29.780]   And so what you wind up with is piecemeal solutions
[00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:32.420]   like this, a universal basic income by itself.
[00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:34.780]   First of all, it doesn't have to cost a trillion dollars.
[00:36:34.780 --> 00:36:36.220]   You have phase outs for it.
[00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:37.980]   The same way that we have phase outs
[00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:41.420]   for all sorts of benefits that are there in the tax zone.
[00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:43.060]   - Income testing.
[00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:47.300]   - Yeah, or at least once you reach a certain level,
[00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:50.900]   then your basic income starts dropping at 50%
[00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:54.180]   per dollar that you earn until it reaches certain levels
[00:36:54.180 --> 00:36:56.380]   so that you don't have people,
[00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:57.820]   so that you don't have Rupert Murdoch
[00:36:57.820 --> 00:37:00.980]   collecting a thousand dollars a month in UBI.
[00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:03.820]   (laughing)
[00:37:03.820 --> 00:37:08.820]   So basically what you have is people who are in the,
[00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:11.740]   you probably have about 50% of the population
[00:37:11.740 --> 00:37:13.580]   that is getting some sort of assistance.
[00:37:13.580 --> 00:37:17.580]   And that's the same way that the Affordable Care Act works.
[00:37:17.580 --> 00:37:18.740]   So you know, and-
[00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:20.460]   - Or used to work, yeah.
[00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:23.780]   - Well, in some respects, it still does
[00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:26.300]   because the law was never repealed
[00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:28.940]   and the courts have upheld most portions of it.
[00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:32.820]   But that's a good example of a program
[00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:36.180]   that had to be put together and be cobbled together
[00:37:36.180 --> 00:37:38.380]   in a way with a whole bunch of provisions
[00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:40.020]   that didn't make sense.
[00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:41.700]   And as a result, you have something
[00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:46.700]   that for political reasons doesn't work as well as it should.
[00:37:46.700 --> 00:37:49.860]   And I'm afraid that when you start talking
[00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:53.420]   about economic programs that benefit the entire populace
[00:37:53.420 --> 00:37:57.180]   and you try to build them one brick at a time
[00:37:57.180 --> 00:37:58.860]   and you argue over each brick,
[00:37:58.860 --> 00:38:03.860]   you're going to wind up with something that is not very solid,
[00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:07.460]   not very stable, not very sensible.
[00:38:07.460 --> 00:38:11.180]   And that's just kind of the way this country works these days.
[00:38:11.180 --> 00:38:12.500]   - Yeah.
[00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:13.340]   - Yeah.
[00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:15.300]   - I just wanna say something so people don't yell me
[00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:17.380]   for always being a Debbie Downer.
[00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:21.380]   I could literally fix America's problems
[00:38:21.380 --> 00:38:23.820]   with two things.
[00:38:23.820 --> 00:38:28.820]   The first thing is cut the defense budget 90% for two years
[00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:31.940]   and you can even do a year on, a year off,
[00:38:31.940 --> 00:38:34.860]   just cut a 90%, just have enough money to pay everyone
[00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:36.300]   in our armed forces for that year.
[00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:37.940]   But all the rest of that money,
[00:38:37.940 --> 00:38:40.860]   put it into a hydro system with the water.
[00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:43.660]   Like if you look to Portland, they're going in their tunnels
[00:38:43.660 --> 00:38:45.860]   and they're putting in hydroelectricity in the water.
[00:38:45.860 --> 00:38:47.580]   So when you get water coming to your house,
[00:38:47.580 --> 00:38:48.460]   which it pumps through time,
[00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:50.980]   so anyway, every 10 feet or 100 new yards,
[00:38:50.980 --> 00:38:53.140]   whatever it is, they got the little ball just rolling around
[00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:54.500]   and they're producing electricity.
[00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:56.220]   Soon everybody's gonna have free electricity.
[00:38:56.220 --> 00:38:58.580]   If somebody who always says as a president,
[00:38:58.580 --> 00:38:59.700]   we're gonna do infrastructure,
[00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:02.300]   actually did infrastructure, put all that defense money
[00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:04.300]   and they're building a hydro system for water.
[00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:06.460]   Of course, Atlanta City Electric would like it,
[00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:09.500]   but the cost of just electricity will come down,
[00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:11.500]   which would help other costs of living.
[00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:13.380]   And if you did that every 10 years to,
[00:39:13.380 --> 00:39:14.860]   hey, we're gonna actually fix this.
[00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:16.140]   We're gonna actually fix that.
[00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:19.460]   We'd be good, but we spend money on jets that are invisible
[00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:21.180]   and nobody can see them.
[00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:23.140]   And we don't use them for anything
[00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:25.700]   because we don't have jet fighter battles anymore
[00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:28.780]   and we're building tanks that no one uses tanks anymore.
[00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:30.340]   And we spent all this money way,
[00:39:30.340 --> 00:39:35.180]   but if we just went and did a hydro system with the water,
[00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:37.060]   oh, the things that we could do
[00:39:37.060 --> 00:39:39.180]   if we actually did something with our infrastructure.
[00:39:39.180 --> 00:39:40.700]   But America, I digress.
[00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:42.700]   - It's the real world though, you know?
[00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:44.220]   We can imagine a perfect world,
[00:39:44.220 --> 00:39:48.180]   but there's humans in it and that's gross out for everybody.
[00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:52.860]   Money in humans, bad mix.
[00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:56.540]   - Yeah, I think about those small towns in South Carolina
[00:39:56.540 --> 00:40:01.540]   that I grew up in and places like rural Louisiana.
[00:40:01.540 --> 00:40:04.460]   How are those people, those residents affected
[00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:08.860]   by getting $1,000 a month and still struggling down there
[00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:11.860]   and let alone dealing with things like natural disasters.
[00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:15.260]   And what is that gonna do for them?
[00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:17.700]   And are they gonna get any other assistance
[00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:19.260]   and stuff like that is gonna happen?
[00:40:19.260 --> 00:40:23.340]   - Right, do food stamps and Medicare go away?
[00:40:23.340 --> 00:40:24.940]   - Because the cost limit keeps going up.
[00:40:24.940 --> 00:40:26.140]   - Yeah.
[00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:27.940]   I mean, there's a lot unanswered questions.
[00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:28.780]   I think it's interesting.
[00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:30.700]   I mean, Mark Andreessen very famously said,
[00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:33.220]   "Well, you don't have to worry about robots taking your job
[00:40:33.220 --> 00:40:37.260]   because the cost of goods will go down so much
[00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:40.020]   that it effectively life will be free."
[00:40:40.020 --> 00:40:42.700]   I think he likes universal basic income as well.
[00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:45.780]   And so it's the opposite, everything that's cheaper.
[00:40:45.780 --> 00:40:48.580]   And you'll have a leisure time. - Like whenever,
[00:40:48.580 --> 00:40:50.940]   no matter what you do in this world,
[00:40:50.940 --> 00:40:52.300]   a Star Trek sounds great.
[00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:54.380]   Unless aliens come, we gotta bond together,
[00:40:54.380 --> 00:40:55.460]   nothing will ever be free.
[00:40:55.460 --> 00:40:57.340]   Even from the beginning of time when there was no currency,
[00:40:57.340 --> 00:40:58.620]   there was a barter ship.
[00:40:58.620 --> 00:41:00.660]   You gotta put in something for something.
[00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:03.260]   Nothing is free and,
[00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:04.380]   (imitates phone ringing)
[00:41:04.380 --> 00:41:05.780]   there's no nothing free.
[00:41:05.780 --> 00:41:07.180]   - All right, I'll tell you something that's free.
[00:41:07.180 --> 00:41:10.020]   You got your Amazon Echo ready?
[00:41:10.020 --> 00:41:12.940]   This is actually, it's an ad for an insurance company
[00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:13.980]   called Hippo.
[00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:16.900]   They've created a new away mode.
[00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:21.900]   Protect your home with the new awkward Amazon Echo skill.
[00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:24.900]   They've got writers from Saturday and live
[00:41:24.900 --> 00:41:27.420]   in other places writing arguments
[00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:30.980]   that will come out of your Echo when you're not home
[00:41:30.980 --> 00:41:31.900]   and go on and on.
[00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:33.180]   This one, I'll play a little bit.
[00:41:33.180 --> 00:41:35.780]   This is a mom walking her daughter
[00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:38.300]   through assembling a dresser over the phone.
[00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:39.860]   It goes on for 68 minutes.
[00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:40.980]   - It still just into the hole.
[00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:42.500]   No, wait.
[00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:44.820]   Yeah, you put the cylinders into the holes.
[00:41:44.820 --> 00:41:45.780]   You see 'em?
[00:41:45.780 --> 00:41:47.380]   - This is coming out of your Echo.
[00:41:47.380 --> 00:41:48.380]   - Good.
[00:41:48.380 --> 00:41:50.300]   - When the burglars are at the door.
[00:41:50.300 --> 00:41:51.940]   How about this one?
[00:41:51.940 --> 00:41:54.700]   Book Club meeting where everything but the book is discussed.
[00:41:54.700 --> 00:41:56.340]   - These are books we've read.
[00:41:56.340 --> 00:42:00.820]   I like that it was like a scary diary of a super neat.
[00:42:00.820 --> 00:42:01.980]   Did you see the movie?
[00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:03.420]   - Oh, yes.
[00:42:03.420 --> 00:42:04.260]   Glenn and I go--
[00:42:04.260 --> 00:42:05.100]   - This is a good one.
[00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:06.420]   A couple is fighting.
[00:42:06.420 --> 00:42:08.860]   - With the TV, the chairs your mind plus the little two.
[00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:09.700]   - Of course.
[00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:11.820]   Oh, and Roger's coming with me too.
[00:42:11.820 --> 00:42:13.060]   What?
[00:42:13.060 --> 00:42:13.900]   What?
[00:42:13.900 --> 00:42:15.940]   You wouldn't even take care of him anymore.
[00:42:15.940 --> 00:42:16.900]   - I adopted him.
[00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:18.180]   I took him to get shudged.
[00:42:18.180 --> 00:42:19.900]   I paid for the vet fees.
[00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:20.740]   He's mine.
[00:42:20.740 --> 00:42:21.580]   - I'm turning this--
[00:42:21.580 --> 00:42:22.460]   - But if I leave him with you,
[00:42:22.460 --> 00:42:24.020]   you'll never scoop his litter.
[00:42:24.020 --> 00:42:25.900]   It'll be a health hazard for the both of you.
[00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:26.940]   - If I'm a burglar,
[00:42:26.940 --> 00:42:29.620]   I'm gonna actually stand outside and listen.
[00:42:29.620 --> 00:42:32.700]   I wanna hear what's gonna happen with Roger.
[00:42:32.700 --> 00:42:34.620]   - I hope I don't live next to the people
[00:42:34.620 --> 00:42:36.860]   who turn that damn thing off.
[00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:38.060]   - Turn it all the way up.
[00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:43.060]   - When they go away and I'm there with the paper thin wall
[00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:46.700]   and paper thin walls have to listen to their--
[00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:49.620]   - Did you know that when you did,
[00:42:49.620 --> 00:42:50.500]   did you ever do this?
[00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:51.340]   I did this.
[00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:53.460]   We'd leave the lights on and the TV going when we left
[00:42:53.460 --> 00:42:55.900]   so that the burglar would think somebody's home.
[00:42:55.900 --> 00:42:56.740]   - Right, sure.
[00:42:56.740 --> 00:42:57.580]   - It's kinda like that.
[00:42:57.580 --> 00:42:59.300]   Here's one passionate argument
[00:42:59.300 --> 00:43:02.020]   over the rules of a complicated board game.
[00:43:02.020 --> 00:43:03.180]   How many times does this happen?
[00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:04.020]   - I'm in the rule book.
[00:43:04.020 --> 00:43:05.900]   I'm already in the other rule book.
[00:43:05.900 --> 00:43:07.660]   Not this one, the rule book.
[00:43:07.660 --> 00:43:09.580]   That's the rule's reference.
[00:43:09.580 --> 00:43:10.980]   Right, the rule.
[00:43:10.980 --> 00:43:13.820]   No, it's in the learn to play guy.
[00:43:13.820 --> 00:43:17.140]   - But this goes on for 47 minutes.
[00:43:17.140 --> 00:43:19.660]   - I know the rule, I'm not a newbie.
[00:43:19.660 --> 00:43:20.980]   - Nobody's saying a newbie.
[00:43:20.980 --> 00:43:22.900]   - Well, you're saying it was actually a salmon.
[00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:24.340]   (laughing)
[00:43:24.340 --> 00:43:27.420]   - These are, this is some of the worst acting.
[00:43:27.420 --> 00:43:28.460]   - The acting's terrible.
[00:43:28.460 --> 00:43:29.460]   - I agree with you that.
[00:43:29.460 --> 00:43:33.780]   - They need, they're better off sending like a recording truck
[00:43:33.780 --> 00:43:36.660]   to Colorado and follow stoners around.
[00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:38.100]   - That's actually a better idea, yeah.
[00:43:38.100 --> 00:43:39.660]   - And get some real conversation.
[00:43:39.660 --> 00:43:40.500]   Like me and you like--
[00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:44.660]   - Get Elon Musk and his brother in the hot tub.
[00:43:44.660 --> 00:43:46.980]   Just record a couple hours of that.
[00:43:46.980 --> 00:43:48.980]   And that would be better.
[00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:51.900]   - Yeah, that was terrible.
[00:43:51.900 --> 00:43:54.460]   - They got writers, good writers, SNL from,
[00:43:54.460 --> 00:43:57.220]   it's always sunny in Philadelphia, UCB.
[00:43:57.220 --> 00:44:00.100]   Unfortunately, they need better actors.
[00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:01.020]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:44:01.020 --> 00:44:03.260]   - Let us like TV and TV on it.
[00:44:03.260 --> 00:44:04.100]   It is like that.
[00:44:04.100 --> 00:44:06.300]   I just, you know, I have a dog.
[00:44:07.900 --> 00:44:11.180]   - I leave my TV on, well, actually it's not my television.
[00:44:11.180 --> 00:44:14.580]   I just leave my computer running with like Netflix
[00:44:14.580 --> 00:44:16.140]   or something, one like that.
[00:44:16.140 --> 00:44:16.980]   - That's good.
[00:44:16.980 --> 00:44:20.340]   - But I don't necessarily do that for security.
[00:44:20.340 --> 00:44:23.500]   I do that just to keep the dogs quiet.
[00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:25.780]   And you like that white noise.
[00:44:25.780 --> 00:44:26.620]   That's about it.
[00:44:26.620 --> 00:44:27.780]   - Yeah, dog's also just,
[00:44:27.780 --> 00:44:29.260]   you know, just run Twitch TV.
[00:44:29.260 --> 00:44:30.260]   They're running 24/7.
[00:44:30.260 --> 00:44:31.100]   - Just run us.
[00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:32.260]   - We sent like real people.
[00:44:32.260 --> 00:44:33.100]   - There you go.
[00:44:33.100 --> 00:44:33.940]   - Yeah, that's all right.
[00:44:33.940 --> 00:44:34.780]   - There's one of them.
[00:44:34.780 --> 00:44:37.340]   Two average guys brainstorming
[00:44:37.340 --> 00:44:38.580]   their next podcast.
[00:44:38.580 --> 00:44:39.580]   - What else is interesting?
[00:44:39.580 --> 00:44:40.500]   - What dude?
[00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:43.300]   Okay, so you know how much I love Ketchup, right?
[00:44:43.300 --> 00:44:44.540]   - For sure.
[00:44:44.540 --> 00:44:47.460]   Remember that when you like drank the entire bottle.
[00:44:47.460 --> 00:44:48.460]   - Which time?
[00:44:48.460 --> 00:44:51.660]   - Your Romania.
[00:44:51.660 --> 00:44:52.500]   - True that.
[00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:54.900]   (laughing)
[00:44:54.900 --> 00:44:56.020]   - All right, all right.
[00:44:56.020 --> 00:44:56.860]   All right, all right.
[00:44:56.860 --> 00:44:59.020]   I just had to mention it.
[00:44:59.020 --> 00:45:01.260]   (laughing)
[00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:04.740]   Oh, and Owen.
[00:45:04.740 --> 00:45:06.340]   - Oh, that hurt.
[00:45:06.340 --> 00:45:07.700]   - That hurt, that hurts me.
[00:45:07.700 --> 00:45:08.540]   It hurts.
[00:45:08.540 --> 00:45:09.380]   - It hurts.
[00:45:09.380 --> 00:45:11.100]   It was so, so bad.
[00:45:11.100 --> 00:45:13.700]   - Leo, you'll appreciate this.
[00:45:13.700 --> 00:45:16.980]   My wife, Judy and I have a,
[00:45:16.980 --> 00:45:20.460]   you know, every, Mary couple has secret signals.
[00:45:20.460 --> 00:45:23.100]   Little things that, you know,
[00:45:23.100 --> 00:45:24.860]   the thing that you say.
[00:45:24.860 --> 00:45:29.020]   So if one of us is telling a story that we've told before
[00:45:29.020 --> 00:45:32.500]   or going on a little too long with the story,
[00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:33.940]   we have permission.
[00:45:33.940 --> 00:45:37.420]   The way you, the way you shut that down is you say,
[00:45:37.420 --> 00:45:38.860]   wow, honey, that's a great story.
[00:45:38.860 --> 00:45:40.820]   Why don't you save it for your podcast?
[00:45:40.820 --> 00:45:43.060]   (laughing)
[00:45:43.060 --> 00:45:47.660]   - Yeah, but see, that wouldn't work on me
[00:45:47.660 --> 00:45:51.500]   because I have a lot of stories I repeat over and over again
[00:45:51.500 --> 00:45:52.420]   on my podcast.
[00:45:52.420 --> 00:45:53.260]   So yeah.
[00:45:53.260 --> 00:45:54.260]   - Yeah.
[00:45:54.260 --> 00:45:55.100]   - Yeah.
[00:45:55.100 --> 00:45:56.020]   - I need something that says,
[00:45:56.020 --> 00:45:57.460]   oh, honey, why don't you save that
[00:45:57.460 --> 00:46:00.020]   when you're not on a podcast?
[00:46:00.020 --> 00:46:03.060]   That would maybe work a little bit better.
[00:46:03.060 --> 00:46:04.620]   All right, let's take a break.
[00:46:04.620 --> 00:46:06.860]   Can we get anybody upset about Facebook?
[00:46:06.860 --> 00:46:08.060]   How's Facebook doing these?
[00:46:08.060 --> 00:46:08.900]   - Oh, hell yes.
[00:46:08.900 --> 00:46:10.940]   - Oh, hell yes.
[00:46:10.940 --> 00:46:13.180]   We'll talk about Facebook and more.
[00:46:13.180 --> 00:46:15.420]   We didn't really go on and on about Apple
[00:46:15.420 --> 00:46:17.780]   and, you know, how many iPhones it sold
[00:46:17.780 --> 00:46:18.620]   and all that stuff.
[00:46:18.620 --> 00:46:19.940]   And I guess--
[00:46:19.940 --> 00:46:21.860]   - They're horrible new MacBook Pros.
[00:46:21.860 --> 00:46:22.860]   - I love them.
[00:46:22.860 --> 00:46:25.060]   Did you get your oven?
[00:46:25.060 --> 00:46:25.900]   You got easy make up.
[00:46:25.900 --> 00:46:26.900]   - It's not an oven.
[00:46:26.900 --> 00:46:28.180]   So-- - Got an easy bake oven?
[00:46:28.180 --> 00:46:30.580]   - Yeah, boy, you know, this is an example of how,
[00:46:30.580 --> 00:46:35.580]   one YouTuber can really ruin it for a company,
[00:46:35.580 --> 00:46:37.900]   you could be a trillion dollar company,
[00:46:37.900 --> 00:46:41.140]   but Dave to D says, oh, it's hot.
[00:46:41.140 --> 00:46:42.380]   I'm gonna put it in the freezer.
[00:46:42.380 --> 00:46:43.820]   Look how much cooler it is.
[00:46:43.820 --> 00:46:47.540]   And the world, even my trainer at the gym said,
[00:46:47.540 --> 00:46:50.260]   I hear those MacBooks are really hot.
[00:46:50.260 --> 00:46:51.620]   I don't want one.
[00:46:51.620 --> 00:46:54.220]   I wonder how much that's gonna impact Apple.
[00:46:54.220 --> 00:46:56.860]   Apple, by the, you know, last week said,
[00:46:56.860 --> 00:46:59.580]   oh, no, no, no, sorry, there's a little,
[00:46:59.580 --> 00:47:02.060]   we left out something called a digital key.
[00:47:02.060 --> 00:47:03.620]   I installed it immediately.
[00:47:03.620 --> 00:47:05.260]   It fixed all the problems.
[00:47:05.260 --> 00:47:06.380]   It's a great laptop.
[00:47:06.380 --> 00:47:07.540]   I love it.
[00:47:07.540 --> 00:47:11.420]   And I did not like the 2016 or 2017's at all.
[00:47:11.420 --> 00:47:12.780]   - You got the one with the I9.
[00:47:12.780 --> 00:47:13.940]   - I got the I9.
[00:47:13.940 --> 00:47:16.540]   - This is not hot.
[00:47:16.540 --> 00:47:17.820]   - The transfer is hot though.
[00:47:17.820 --> 00:47:19.420]   - Well, it's hot if it's working,
[00:47:19.420 --> 00:47:20.700]   but that's how it should be.
[00:47:20.700 --> 00:47:21.540]   Look at this thing,
[00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:23.540]   Aunt Pruitt's got over his right shoulder.
[00:47:23.540 --> 00:47:26.660]   That thing is got air cooling, water cooling,
[00:47:26.660 --> 00:47:30.300]   nitrogen cooling because it's,
[00:47:30.300 --> 00:47:32.580]   but yes, but when it works, it's gonna get hot, right?
[00:47:32.580 --> 00:47:34.420]   That's why you have all that cooling.
[00:47:34.420 --> 00:47:37.380]   - Do you have your little transformer cube?
[00:47:37.380 --> 00:47:39.060]   - What is that thing up there?
[00:47:39.060 --> 00:47:40.860]   - That's a P2.
[00:47:40.860 --> 00:47:42.900]   - A Pentium 2?
[00:47:42.900 --> 00:47:43.740]   - Yeah.
[00:47:43.740 --> 00:47:44.660]   - Why do you have just sitting on the top?
[00:47:44.660 --> 00:47:46.460]   It's not gonna help you on top of the machine.
[00:47:46.460 --> 00:47:47.700]   (laughing)
[00:47:47.700 --> 00:47:48.540]   - That's cool.
[00:47:48.540 --> 00:47:51.700]   - That's not gonna help you in 2018.
[00:47:51.700 --> 00:47:53.620]   - Remember though, you remember those P2s?
[00:47:53.620 --> 00:47:54.740]   It was like a slot.
[00:47:54.740 --> 00:47:55.780]   It wasn't big slot.
[00:47:55.780 --> 00:47:56.620]   - It was like--
[00:47:56.620 --> 00:47:57.460]   - Exactly what it is.
[00:47:57.460 --> 00:47:58.300]   - Yeah. - That's why.
[00:47:58.300 --> 00:47:59.140]   - Yeah.
[00:47:59.140 --> 00:48:01.580]   Look at the size of that thing.
[00:48:01.580 --> 00:48:02.420]   No, I like it.
[00:48:02.420 --> 00:48:04.260]   I like having six cores.
[00:48:04.260 --> 00:48:05.900]   It's very responsive.
[00:48:05.900 --> 00:48:06.740]   I'm actually very happy.
[00:48:06.740 --> 00:48:08.700]   And I hated the keyboards,
[00:48:08.700 --> 00:48:10.860]   but they put that little silicone dome
[00:48:10.860 --> 00:48:12.060]   and it's just a slight difference,
[00:48:12.060 --> 00:48:14.540]   but it's just enough so I can live with the keyboard.
[00:48:14.540 --> 00:48:15.900]   I'm not thrilled with it.
[00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:17.300]   But no, I love the speed of that thing.
[00:48:17.300 --> 00:48:19.540]   Battery life's really good to this.
[00:48:19.540 --> 00:48:21.460]   Intel's speed step's doing the right thing.
[00:48:21.460 --> 00:48:23.740]   It slows it way down when it's not working,
[00:48:23.740 --> 00:48:25.780]   but it gives me plenty of horsepower when it is.
[00:48:25.780 --> 00:48:28.420]   I feel like it's a nice thing.
[00:48:28.420 --> 00:48:29.500]   - Did you get your little blunt,
[00:48:29.500 --> 00:48:32.060]   little transformer box that goes along with it?
[00:48:32.060 --> 00:48:33.820]   - Yeah, the E-G-P-U.
[00:48:33.820 --> 00:48:35.620]   - Yeah.
[00:48:35.620 --> 00:48:36.460]   - Yeah.
[00:48:36.460 --> 00:48:40.540]   - I'm gonna tote that around with my portable laptop.
[00:48:40.540 --> 00:48:43.060]   Let me just, let me just, hey, hey,
[00:48:43.060 --> 00:48:45.500]   Aunt, why don't you just drop your computer to your back
[00:48:45.500 --> 00:48:47.300]   and take it with your laptop everywhere you go?
[00:48:47.300 --> 00:48:48.140]   - That's right.
[00:48:48.140 --> 00:48:49.940]   - Get that Mac performance.
[00:48:49.940 --> 00:48:52.420]   Get that indoor cool backpack on.
[00:48:52.420 --> 00:48:53.420]   Like, I mean, come on.
[00:48:53.420 --> 00:48:56.460]   The only thing that this laptop has is 32 gigs of RAM.
[00:48:56.460 --> 00:48:59.220]   Thanks for coming in to the 21st century Apple.
[00:48:59.220 --> 00:49:01.900]   And secondly, you are king of touchscreens.
[00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:04.620]   These things cost $4 billion and I feel--
[00:49:04.620 --> 00:49:05.780]   - Keep that on screen.
[00:49:05.780 --> 00:49:07.820]   - It's got a touch bar.
[00:49:07.820 --> 00:49:08.700]   - You gotta bo--
[00:49:08.700 --> 00:49:09.540]   Who wants a bar?
[00:49:09.540 --> 00:49:10.980]   I want the screen.
[00:49:10.980 --> 00:49:12.420]   I'm hungry, Uncle Leo.
[00:49:12.420 --> 00:49:13.660]   The bar ain't feeding me.
[00:49:13.660 --> 00:49:15.500]   I need the whole restaurant.
[00:49:15.500 --> 00:49:17.540]   - Hey, I gotta say one thing.
[00:49:17.540 --> 00:49:20.180]   You put this next to the Mac Pro.
[00:49:20.180 --> 00:49:21.220]   Here's the popcorn.
[00:49:21.220 --> 00:49:22.220]   It's out.
[00:49:22.220 --> 00:49:23.220]   Keep going on.
[00:49:23.220 --> 00:49:26.740]   - I'm saying you, you listen, you can't roll with your head.
[00:49:26.740 --> 00:49:27.740]   You got a laptop.
[00:49:27.740 --> 00:49:29.140]   Why do I need this box?
[00:49:29.140 --> 00:49:30.220]   And what am I going to do?
[00:49:30.220 --> 00:49:31.460]   You can't roll with a little suit.
[00:49:31.460 --> 00:49:33.060]   What are you doing with that?
[00:49:33.060 --> 00:49:34.140]   Why?
[00:49:34.140 --> 00:49:35.660]   And I know you got money.
[00:49:35.660 --> 00:49:37.300]   Yeah, you rock with my baby that thing.
[00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:38.740]   It looks like a little--
[00:49:38.740 --> 00:49:41.300]   - It looks great next to the Mac Pro.
[00:49:41.300 --> 00:49:42.980]   It's exactly the same size.
[00:49:42.980 --> 00:49:43.980]   - Little mark.
[00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:46.020]   - And I can't wait till you go on vacation.
[00:49:46.020 --> 00:49:47.460]   Make sure you take that with you.
[00:49:47.460 --> 00:49:51.060]   Pack it and feel the pain of lumbering that thing around
[00:49:51.060 --> 00:49:53.380]   when you go coast to coast, keep rest of your kilargot.
[00:49:53.380 --> 00:49:56.580]   Go ahead with your little pancake making Mac Pro.
[00:49:56.580 --> 00:49:57.580]   Go ahead, take--
[00:49:57.580 --> 00:50:02.620]   - You do have to wonder what exactly after it was thinking.
[00:50:02.620 --> 00:50:03.620]   They don't make this.
[00:50:03.620 --> 00:50:04.620]   This is black magic.
[00:50:04.620 --> 00:50:05.620]   They just sell it.
[00:50:05.620 --> 00:50:07.980]   - But I can't get an SD card slot, though.
[00:50:07.980 --> 00:50:09.060]   - No, you don't need that.
[00:50:09.060 --> 00:50:13.060]   You need an EGPU.
[00:50:13.060 --> 00:50:16.380]   - But Mr. LaPorit, even when I saw you on the screen savers
[00:50:16.380 --> 00:50:21.020]   with that thing, it didn't even help with running motion.
[00:50:21.020 --> 00:50:22.020]   - No.
[00:50:22.020 --> 00:50:24.380]   - It didn't seem like it was offload in any of the resources
[00:50:24.380 --> 00:50:25.380]   to it, right?
[00:50:25.380 --> 00:50:30.780]   - There seems to be a setting that each app has to have
[00:50:30.780 --> 00:50:33.340]   that says use the EGPU.
[00:50:33.340 --> 00:50:35.140]   And that is another issue.
[00:50:35.140 --> 00:50:38.620]   I found a script that we were able to apply that does
[00:50:38.620 --> 00:50:39.740]   then get the EGPU.
[00:50:39.740 --> 00:50:41.540]   You know, it's interesting because--
[00:50:41.540 --> 00:50:44.300]   - How much did you pay for this thing, Cleo?
[00:50:44.300 --> 00:50:45.140]   - Too much.
[00:50:45.140 --> 00:50:46.900]   - How much money did you give away?
[00:50:46.900 --> 00:50:49.900]   - This thing that you have to Google some kind of script
[00:50:49.900 --> 00:50:52.900]   that will actually make it do the thing that it's supposed
[00:50:52.900 --> 00:50:59.380]   to do for the $6,000 or whatever you spent for it or set it out.
[00:50:59.380 --> 00:51:00.220]   - Hey, guess what?
[00:51:00.220 --> 00:51:03.700]   Uncle Leo, you know the best thing about that little box is?
[00:51:03.700 --> 00:51:06.700]   You had the capability and the power to put some stamps
[00:51:06.700 --> 00:51:08.740]   on it at your business and send it back to Apple.
[00:51:08.740 --> 00:51:11.740]   - Oh, yeah, thanks to Stamps.com,
[00:51:11.740 --> 00:51:15.300]   our sponsor today, they're helping me pay for the EGPU.
[00:51:15.300 --> 00:51:17.420]   We're on the monthly installments.
[00:51:17.420 --> 00:51:18.820]   - Hello, Leo.
[00:51:18.820 --> 00:51:20.820]   (laughing)
[00:51:20.820 --> 00:51:22.780]   - I got it on the installment plan.
[00:51:22.780 --> 00:51:31.260]   Stamps.com is the way, the way to save a trip
[00:51:31.260 --> 00:51:32.460]   to the post office.
[00:51:32.460 --> 00:51:34.940]   If you are, if you use the postal service,
[00:51:34.940 --> 00:51:35.780]   and who doesn't, right?
[00:51:35.780 --> 00:51:38.860]   Whether it's sending out brochures or invoices
[00:51:38.860 --> 00:51:40.900]   or maybe you sell stuff on Amazon
[00:51:40.900 --> 00:51:43.900]   or Etsy or eBay, you know your mail-in stuff,
[00:51:43.900 --> 00:51:46.340]   don't go to the post office,
[00:51:46.340 --> 00:51:50.260]   do everything you could do at the post office at your desk.
[00:51:50.260 --> 00:51:52.260]   I mean, I still go to the post office just to say hi
[00:51:52.260 --> 00:51:55.980]   'cause I like the mailman, but you can buy and print
[00:51:55.980 --> 00:51:58.980]   your own real US postage from your computer
[00:51:58.980 --> 00:52:00.460]   and your printer with Stamps.com,
[00:52:00.460 --> 00:52:01.740]   but it doesn't stop there.
[00:52:01.740 --> 00:52:04.140]   You get a USB scale so you always have exactly
[00:52:04.140 --> 00:52:05.580]   the right postage.
[00:52:05.580 --> 00:52:08.740]   It will suggest ways to save money on postage.
[00:52:08.740 --> 00:52:11.300]   It fills out the forms.
[00:52:11.300 --> 00:52:14.380]   If you're sending internationally or you're sending certified,
[00:52:14.380 --> 00:52:18.060]   it even pulls in the addresses from your address book,
[00:52:18.060 --> 00:52:21.580]   prints your own return address automatically
[00:52:21.580 --> 00:52:25.540]   plus a company logo or an image if you want.
[00:52:25.540 --> 00:52:29.620]   You can print real stamps, you can print on an envelope,
[00:52:29.620 --> 00:52:32.540]   you can print a label of any kind.
[00:52:32.540 --> 00:52:35.620]   It'll even send out the email and all of that stuff.

[00:53:29.060 --> 00:53:31.780]   - Hey, you could always return Apple products.
[00:53:31.780 --> 00:53:32.700]   They get too hot.
[00:53:32.700 --> 00:53:33.700]   - Put a stamp on it.
[00:53:33.700 --> 00:53:35.900]   - Got it, put a stamp on it.
[00:53:35.900 --> 00:53:37.500]   I don't know, maybe I drank the Kool-Aid.
[00:53:37.500 --> 00:53:42.500]   You know me, I'm not an Apple fan boy.
[00:53:42.500 --> 00:53:44.780]   - It's part of your job, I understand.
[00:53:44.780 --> 00:53:46.940]   And there's a thing called tax write-offs.
[00:53:46.940 --> 00:53:49.020]   And I mean, when I yell at you by spending this money,
[00:53:49.020 --> 00:53:51.180]   I understand, I'm looking at, again,
[00:53:51.180 --> 00:53:52.260]   I always repeat this to you.
[00:53:52.260 --> 00:53:55.300]   And one day we're gonna set it up with the Owen exchange program.
[00:53:55.300 --> 00:53:56.620]   - I should just send you all this stuff, yeah.
[00:53:56.620 --> 00:53:58.540]   - Or ridiculous things that I, oh,
[00:53:58.540 --> 00:54:00.140]   see like somebody sent me one of these.
[00:54:00.140 --> 00:54:00.980]   - What's that?
[00:54:00.980 --> 00:54:02.100]   - They put me on that list.
[00:54:02.100 --> 00:54:03.660]   (laughing)
[00:54:03.660 --> 00:54:05.740]   - You got a blackberry, you lucky dog.
[00:54:05.740 --> 00:54:06.580]   - Look at that.
[00:54:06.580 --> 00:54:07.420]   - Get to the back.
[00:54:07.420 --> 00:54:09.780]   So this right here, first from Playberry,
[00:54:09.780 --> 00:54:12.780]   this is that LG G7 ThinQ.
[00:54:12.780 --> 00:54:14.060]   This is a sexy phone.
[00:54:14.060 --> 00:54:15.380]   It's an iPhone 1 to B.
[00:54:15.380 --> 00:54:16.220]   - It's pretty.
[00:54:16.220 --> 00:54:17.060]   - iPhone X.
[00:54:17.060 --> 00:54:17.900]   - It does have a notch.
[00:54:17.900 --> 00:54:18.980]   - It does have a fingerprint reader in the back.
[00:54:18.980 --> 00:54:20.260]   It does have a notch,
[00:54:20.260 --> 00:54:21.860]   but it's got a fingerprint reader in the back.
[00:54:21.860 --> 00:54:23.260]   It's got Google AI.
[00:54:23.260 --> 00:54:24.420]   So when I put it up to stuff,
[00:54:24.420 --> 00:54:25.780]   it tells me what it is and where it goes.
[00:54:25.780 --> 00:54:27.540]   I mean, like, you know, doing innovative things,
[00:54:27.540 --> 00:54:29.300]   like Apple does.
[00:54:29.300 --> 00:54:30.220]   And this is a--
[00:54:30.220 --> 00:54:31.580]   - That's not innovative, sir.
[00:54:31.580 --> 00:54:33.220]   That is a blackberry.
[00:54:33.220 --> 00:54:34.060]   (laughing)
[00:54:34.060 --> 00:54:36.300]   - Do you know what this is?
[00:54:36.300 --> 00:54:39.660]   This is the suffrage of my child for the next week.
[00:54:39.660 --> 00:54:40.940]   So they said it to me to do like a--
[00:54:40.940 --> 00:54:44.260]   - You're gonna make your kid review the new blackberry?
[00:54:44.260 --> 00:54:48.020]   - I am going to stick this with her for a week,
[00:54:48.020 --> 00:54:51.140]   maybe 10 days and see if she could survive.
[00:54:51.140 --> 00:54:52.940]   See if like it survived.
[00:54:52.940 --> 00:54:55.300]   I wanna know how she feels inside
[00:54:55.300 --> 00:54:57.380]   after having this inner hand.
[00:54:57.380 --> 00:54:58.980]   She's never had a physical keyboard.
[00:54:58.980 --> 00:55:00.020]   She doesn't even know what she--
[00:55:00.020 --> 00:55:02.180]   She looked at this, she said, "What's that?"
[00:55:02.180 --> 00:55:05.100]   So giving this to her and finding out what she does,
[00:55:05.100 --> 00:55:06.460]   what it has, she can do with it,
[00:55:06.460 --> 00:55:09.260]   I'm super excited to torture her with this device.
[00:55:09.260 --> 00:55:12.500]   It excites my soul and heart to make her suffer
[00:55:12.500 --> 00:55:13.580]   through the past.
[00:55:13.580 --> 00:55:15.660]   - You know, next you should give her a name.
[00:55:15.660 --> 00:55:17.740]   - Next you should give her a phone that was a dial on it.
[00:55:17.740 --> 00:55:19.620]   I think that would be really good.
[00:55:19.620 --> 00:55:22.940]   This is a blackberry, what is it, the key to, yeah.
[00:55:22.940 --> 00:55:23.780]   Or key to--
[00:55:23.780 --> 00:55:25.380]   - There is something satisfying and gratifying
[00:55:25.380 --> 00:55:27.380]   about typing in with this keyboard though.
[00:55:27.380 --> 00:55:28.540]   I will say that.
[00:55:28.540 --> 00:55:30.060]   I don't know if it's nostalgia,
[00:55:30.060 --> 00:55:32.060]   but it made me feel good inside.
[00:55:32.060 --> 00:55:33.100]   - Literally typing with this.
[00:55:33.100 --> 00:55:34.780]   - Yeah, but it's weird because it's the size
[00:55:34.780 --> 00:55:37.940]   of a normal phone, but they shrink the screen
[00:55:37.940 --> 00:55:38.780]   to put the keyboard on it.
[00:55:38.780 --> 00:55:41.380]   - There's something besides the side screen is still--
[00:55:41.380 --> 00:55:42.220]   - Yes.
[00:55:42.220 --> 00:55:43.060]   - Look at all that.
[00:55:43.060 --> 00:55:43.900]   - I got three phones right here.
[00:55:43.900 --> 00:55:45.380]   It's still pretty.
[00:55:45.380 --> 00:55:46.540]   - So whatever you do--
[00:55:46.540 --> 00:55:47.980]   - It's like the two of them on my iPhone.
[00:55:47.980 --> 00:55:48.900]   - Don't do what I did.
[00:55:48.900 --> 00:55:50.820]   I went out and bought a Huawei P20.
[00:55:50.820 --> 00:55:53.060]   That's the one with the really good three cameras
[00:55:53.060 --> 00:55:54.700]   and the Leica lens and all that stuff.
[00:55:54.700 --> 00:55:58.220]   And now I learn that the DNC is saying,
[00:55:58.220 --> 00:55:59.700]   whatever you do candidates,
[00:55:59.700 --> 00:56:03.100]   do not use a Huawei or ZTE phone,
[00:56:03.100 --> 00:56:04.900]   even if it's free.
[00:56:04.900 --> 00:56:07.780]   Even if they're giving it away
[00:56:07.780 --> 00:56:10.940]   because they're owned by and founded by
[00:56:10.940 --> 00:56:13.540]   former members of the Chinese military
[00:56:13.540 --> 00:56:15.420]   and the DNC is worried.
[00:56:15.420 --> 00:56:16.900]   You know, the DNC's already worried
[00:56:16.900 --> 00:56:19.140]   that the Russians are gonna hack 'em.
[00:56:19.140 --> 00:56:21.500]   Now they sent out a notice
[00:56:21.500 --> 00:56:23.820]   after they learned that a democratic organization
[00:56:23.820 --> 00:56:27.140]   was considering buying ZTE phones for staffers.
[00:56:27.140 --> 00:56:28.060]   They said, don't.
[00:56:28.060 --> 00:56:29.380]   - Whatever you do, don't.
[00:56:29.380 --> 00:56:31.980]   You guys worry about Chinese phones spying on you.
[00:56:31.980 --> 00:56:34.300]   - Nope.
[00:56:34.300 --> 00:56:35.140]   - Nope.
[00:56:35.140 --> 00:56:36.700]   - Not one bit.
[00:56:36.700 --> 00:56:37.540]   - I do.
[00:56:37.540 --> 00:56:39.300]   I look at that P20 sitting on my dresser thinking,
[00:56:39.300 --> 00:56:40.900]   what's it sending back?
[00:56:40.900 --> 00:56:43.380]   - Everything you own.
[00:56:43.380 --> 00:56:46.220]   - Okay.
[00:56:46.220 --> 00:56:47.220]   - That's a pop card.
[00:56:47.220 --> 00:56:48.060]   - Okay.
[00:56:48.060 --> 00:56:49.740]   - As long as you have an internet connection,
[00:56:49.740 --> 00:56:50.940]   something is phone and home.
[00:56:50.940 --> 00:56:51.780]   - I know.
[00:56:51.780 --> 00:56:53.900]   - I mean, but I should trust Apple, right?
[00:56:53.900 --> 00:56:56.500]   They're not doing anything with that information
[00:56:56.500 --> 00:56:57.860]   they get from my iPhone, aren't they?
[00:56:57.860 --> 00:56:58.700]   - They said they're not,
[00:56:58.700 --> 00:56:59.900]   you should trust them.
[00:56:59.900 --> 00:57:00.740]   - Oh, okay.
[00:57:00.740 --> 00:57:03.580]   (laughing)
[00:57:03.580 --> 00:57:04.700]   You can read, right?
[00:57:04.700 --> 00:57:06.060]   Look at the back of your phone right now.
[00:57:06.060 --> 00:57:08.060]   I'm telling you what it says, the bottom of your phone.
[00:57:08.060 --> 00:57:10.620]   It says designed in California.
[00:57:10.620 --> 00:57:12.060]   Is it made in California?
[00:57:12.060 --> 00:57:13.420]   - No, it's made in China.
[00:57:13.420 --> 00:57:14.900]   - Is it built in California?
[00:57:14.900 --> 00:57:16.060]   - No, it's made in China.
[00:57:16.060 --> 00:57:19.180]   - Okay then, so at the end of the day,
[00:57:19.180 --> 00:57:20.500]   everything you own.
[00:57:20.500 --> 00:57:22.380]   - All Chinese phones.
[00:57:22.380 --> 00:57:27.500]   - I'll tell you what, Facebook is spying, okay?
[00:57:27.500 --> 00:57:29.420]   I'm talking to somebody about pillows,
[00:57:29.420 --> 00:57:31.940]   and by the time I get home, I gotta list the pillows
[00:57:31.940 --> 00:57:33.700]   on Facebook. - Oh no, no, no, no.
[00:57:33.700 --> 00:57:34.780]   - No, no, no, no. - They be spying.
[00:57:34.780 --> 00:57:35.620]   They be spying.
[00:57:35.620 --> 00:57:36.460]   - No, no, no. - What are the odds?
[00:57:36.460 --> 00:57:37.300]   What are the odds?
[00:57:37.300 --> 00:57:38.140]   They're spying. - No, no.
[00:57:38.140 --> 00:57:38.980]   - They're spying. - They're spying.
[00:57:38.980 --> 00:57:39.820]   - No. - They are.
[00:57:39.820 --> 00:57:40.660]   - No. - They are.
[00:57:40.660 --> 00:57:42.300]   - No. - We're my full head.
[00:57:42.300 --> 00:57:43.780]   We're my full head at.
[00:57:43.780 --> 00:57:44.620]   - They're spying.
[00:57:44.620 --> 00:57:47.460]   - Are you saying, you're standing on the street,
[00:57:47.460 --> 00:57:49.740]   just talking with a friend about a product,
[00:57:49.740 --> 00:57:51.780]   and you go home and you see ads for it?
[00:57:51.780 --> 00:57:53.300]   - That's like when you buy a car,
[00:57:53.300 --> 00:57:56.020]   all of a sudden you see a lot of people driving that car, that's all.
[00:57:56.020 --> 00:57:58.500]   - Again, I might be feeling some sort of way,
[00:57:58.500 --> 00:57:59.660]   I might even be delusional.
[00:57:59.660 --> 00:58:01.860]   I'm just saying that it's happening in my mind,
[00:58:01.860 --> 00:58:03.580]   and where I'm crazy, now I don't know.
[00:58:03.580 --> 00:58:05.300]   I just know there's been two or three times
[00:58:05.300 --> 00:58:06.420]   when I was talking about cats.
[00:58:06.420 --> 00:58:07.380]   I don't even like cats,
[00:58:07.380 --> 00:58:09.740]   and I got stuff for cats on my Facebook.
[00:58:09.740 --> 00:58:11.660]   Now I understand it doesn't want to go to Amazon,
[00:58:11.660 --> 00:58:13.020]   or go click on something about--
[00:58:13.020 --> 00:58:13.860]   - You know why?
[00:58:13.860 --> 00:58:17.100]   'Cause you held for three seconds longer,
[00:58:17.100 --> 00:58:19.740]   that it is, that's it, the bottom mine-off phenomenon.
[00:58:19.740 --> 00:58:22.620]   You held for three seconds longer on Instagram,
[00:58:22.620 --> 00:58:23.820]   you were looking at a cat,
[00:58:23.820 --> 00:58:25.580]   and you sent a signal to Facebook.
[00:58:25.580 --> 00:58:26.940]   - He likes cats.
[00:58:26.940 --> 00:58:28.380]   - That I believe they're doing.
[00:58:28.380 --> 00:58:30.540]   Totally believe that.
[00:58:30.540 --> 00:58:33.260]   - Are you gonna use the Facebook?
[00:58:33.260 --> 00:58:36.980]   Now Ed and I are gainfully married, as are you, Ampeh,
[00:58:36.980 --> 00:58:38.860]   but Owen, I think you're single.
[00:58:38.860 --> 00:58:41.540]   Are you gonna use the Facebook dating app?
[00:58:41.540 --> 00:58:44.180]   (laughs)
[00:58:44.180 --> 00:58:46.540]   As Casey Newton writes in the Verge,
[00:58:46.540 --> 00:58:48.200]   let the poking begin.
[00:58:48.200 --> 00:58:50.780]   - Unfortunately for me,
[00:58:51.980 --> 00:58:54.620]   the way I live my lifestyle on the internet,
[00:58:54.620 --> 00:58:56.180]   I'll explain it very quickly.
[00:58:56.180 --> 00:58:57.940]   Let's talk it to a girl, we're out on a date.
[00:58:57.940 --> 00:58:59.500]   She's like, "Oh, have you ever used Tinder?"
[00:58:59.500 --> 00:59:00.740]   I'm like, "No, I don't use Tinder."
[00:59:00.740 --> 00:59:02.820]   She's like, "I don't lie, everybody use you Tinder."
[00:59:02.820 --> 00:59:04.020]   Checked out, I'm like, "I don't."
[00:59:04.020 --> 00:59:05.460]   I was like, "I could prove 100%.
[00:59:05.460 --> 00:59:08.060]   "If I could prove to you that I don't use Tinder,
[00:59:08.060 --> 00:59:09.140]   "then you gotta pay for dinner."
[00:59:09.140 --> 00:59:10.820]   She said, "Okay, 'cause you can't prove it."
[00:59:10.820 --> 00:59:12.420]   So I opened up Tinder,
[00:59:12.420 --> 00:59:15.100]   and Facebook thinks I'm 63 years old,
[00:59:15.100 --> 00:59:18.220]   and the lovely 70-plus-year-old women that wrote my Tinder.
[00:59:18.220 --> 00:59:19.060]   - No, you got it.
[00:59:19.060 --> 00:59:21.300]   - Where it's just set up your profile, dude.
[00:59:21.300 --> 00:59:22.420]   It is set up to my profile.
[00:59:22.420 --> 00:59:24.020]   It uses my Facebook profile.
[00:59:24.020 --> 00:59:24.860]   - Oh.
[00:59:24.860 --> 00:59:26.060]   - I was born in 1949.
[00:59:26.060 --> 00:59:26.900]   - Oh, I see.
[00:59:26.900 --> 00:59:28.260]   You're lying to Facebook,
[00:59:28.260 --> 00:59:31.460]   and you're complaining about what Tinder does as a result.
[00:59:31.460 --> 00:59:33.140]   You gotta tell the truth.
[00:59:33.140 --> 00:59:35.660]   - I'm a white male that lives in New York City
[00:59:35.660 --> 00:59:38.860]   by the name of O'Won, born in 1949.
[00:59:38.860 --> 00:59:40.380]   I'm just saying, I don't use Tinder,
[00:59:40.380 --> 00:59:41.220]   and that's for that reason,
[00:59:41.220 --> 00:59:42.940]   'cause I'm not really fishing for 70-year-olds,
[00:59:42.940 --> 00:59:44.380]   but nothing against 70-year-olds.
[00:59:44.380 --> 00:59:46.820]   - Why do you lie to Facebook?
[00:59:46.820 --> 00:59:48.500]   - 'Cause I don't trust the internet.
[00:59:48.500 --> 00:59:50.300]   I told you I got a full hat on.
[00:59:51.300 --> 00:59:52.300]   (laughing)
[00:59:52.300 --> 00:59:54.020]   - I'm not, I don't trust it.
[00:59:54.020 --> 00:59:55.140]   I lie about every--
[00:59:55.140 --> 00:59:56.900]   - I bet you though, here's the interesting thing.
[00:59:56.900 --> 00:59:58.220]   Here's the interesting thing.
[00:59:58.220 --> 00:59:59.940]   The day that people found out
[00:59:59.940 --> 01:00:02.820]   that Facebook was doing dating,
[01:00:02.820 --> 01:00:05.540]   the stock price of the match group, which owns Tinder,
[01:00:05.540 --> 01:00:08.860]   and you okay, Cupid, plunged 17%.
[01:00:08.860 --> 01:00:11.820]   This is gonna everybody, you and I,
[01:00:11.820 --> 01:00:13.940]   and everybody who listens to this show probably,
[01:00:13.940 --> 01:00:15.860]   is suspicious of Facebook,
[01:00:15.860 --> 01:00:18.500]   but the average person says,
[01:00:18.500 --> 01:00:21.420]   "Yay, it's about time Facebook did dating, right?"
[01:00:21.420 --> 01:00:24.220]   - But you've just described,
[01:00:24.220 --> 01:00:26.100]   we're going back to the beginning of the show now,
[01:00:26.100 --> 01:00:28.260]   you've just described the same phenomenon
[01:00:28.260 --> 01:00:30.140]   that happens to every business
[01:00:30.140 --> 01:00:33.540]   when there's even the slightest bit of news,
[01:00:33.540 --> 01:00:34.540]   slightest bit of rumor--
[01:00:34.540 --> 01:00:35.380]   - Had room for the market--
[01:00:35.380 --> 01:00:36.980]   - That Amazon's going to enter it.
[01:00:36.980 --> 01:00:39.260]   The stock price goes down 10%,
[01:00:39.260 --> 01:00:41.100]   and then over the course of the next two weeks
[01:00:41.100 --> 01:00:42.900]   is everyone realizes, "Oh, wait a minute,
[01:00:42.900 --> 01:00:47.460]   "this is just normal capitalism at work."
[01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:50.340]   The stock price goes back where it was.
[01:00:50.340 --> 01:00:54.620]   The stock market is driven by all these insane,
[01:00:54.620 --> 01:00:55.860]   you wanna talk about signals,
[01:00:55.860 --> 01:00:58.940]   the insane signals that go to market traders,
[01:00:58.940 --> 01:01:00.860]   this is exactly this kind of thing.
[01:01:00.860 --> 01:01:04.940]   How many times has Facebook launched a new product
[01:01:04.940 --> 01:01:07.060]   that has failed spectacularly?
[01:01:07.060 --> 01:01:10.460]   I mean, you could just do a big long list
[01:01:10.460 --> 01:01:14.380]   of all the things that they've done that have failed.
[01:01:14.380 --> 01:01:18.300]   Given their reputation, I would be shocked
[01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:23.220]   if a Facebook dating app turned out to be successful
[01:01:23.220 --> 01:01:28.220]   in less than, maybe in version 6.0, after five years,
[01:01:28.220 --> 01:01:32.300]   they might be able to get it right,
[01:01:32.300 --> 01:01:34.580]   but they don't have a good track record
[01:01:34.580 --> 01:01:36.300]   with this kind of stuff.
[01:01:36.300 --> 01:01:37.980]   - But Amazon-- - That is on the nose.
[01:01:37.980 --> 01:01:38.980]   - On the nose, Ed.
[01:01:38.980 --> 01:01:42.140]   - I don't like the idea,
[01:01:42.140 --> 01:01:47.140]   but I think it's a logical step for Facebook to take
[01:01:47.140 --> 01:01:49.020]   far as trying to get into the data in the world
[01:01:49.020 --> 01:01:49.860]   and what have you,
[01:01:49.860 --> 01:01:52.660]   but I don't like the security aspect of it
[01:01:52.660 --> 01:01:56.220]   because there's already enough issues with Facebook
[01:01:56.220 --> 01:01:59.260]   and privacy and security on there right now,
[01:01:59.260 --> 01:02:02.420]   and now you're making people even more vulnerable
[01:02:02.420 --> 01:02:08.420]   by giving them an avenue to quote unquote date someone,
[01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:10.660]   and you never know what's gonna happen.
[01:02:11.660 --> 01:02:14.700]   - And Facebook already has a personal track record
[01:02:14.700 --> 01:02:18.500]   of being the worst matchmaking site on a Facebook.
[01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:21.700]   You know how many lives that Facebook has ruined
[01:02:21.700 --> 01:02:23.940]   from Susie and Earl getting back together
[01:02:23.940 --> 01:02:25.900]   'cause they used to hook up in the sixth grade
[01:02:25.900 --> 01:02:28.380]   and Earl's got six kids and his wife,
[01:02:28.380 --> 01:02:30.500]   and he thinks that Susie's love is real love
[01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:31.860]   and he leaves his wife and his kids,
[01:02:31.860 --> 01:02:35.020]   and then finds out that Susie is now a man.
[01:02:35.020 --> 01:02:36.420]   Things are crazy on Facebook.
[01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:39.940]   - How many relationships do you think Facebook has created?
[01:02:39.940 --> 01:02:41.900]   - How many is it broken up?
[01:02:41.900 --> 01:02:43.340]   I've broken up twice as many as this creates.
[01:02:43.340 --> 01:02:44.180]   Twice as many.
[01:02:44.180 --> 01:02:45.940]   - Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised.
[01:02:45.940 --> 01:02:48.020]   - That sounds, I'll go with that.
[01:02:48.020 --> 01:02:49.300]   Maybe 80/20.
[01:02:49.300 --> 01:02:50.300]   (laughing)
[01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:51.140]   - There you go.
[01:02:51.140 --> 01:02:52.220]   (laughing)
[01:02:52.220 --> 01:02:53.500]   - You guys are cynics.
[01:02:53.500 --> 01:02:54.820]   How about this?
[01:02:54.820 --> 01:02:58.700]   - Apple's gonna do, in iOS 12 late next month
[01:02:58.700 --> 01:03:02.340]   is gonna start warning you when you use your phone
[01:03:02.340 --> 01:03:04.820]   or individual apps too much.
[01:03:04.820 --> 01:03:08.100]   Apparently Android P, which is about to come out
[01:03:08.100 --> 01:03:09.260]   in a couple of weeks,
[01:03:09.260 --> 01:03:11.220]   won't do it right away, but we'll do it eventually.
[01:03:11.220 --> 01:03:14.860]   Now Facebook and Instagram are adding dashboards
[01:03:14.860 --> 01:03:18.340]   to help you manage your time on their apps.
[01:03:18.340 --> 01:03:21.460]   This seems to be all the rage in Silicon Valley.
[01:03:21.460 --> 01:03:23.980]   How long before-- - I give more credit
[01:03:23.980 --> 01:03:25.740]   for that, I like that idea.
[01:03:25.740 --> 01:03:26.660]   - But you know, I have to say,
[01:03:26.660 --> 01:03:29.340]   I tried it on iOS 12 and I turned it off
[01:03:29.340 --> 01:03:30.500]   'cause it was annoying.
[01:03:30.500 --> 01:03:32.780]   Well, every time I tried to launch Instagram
[01:03:32.780 --> 01:03:34.820]   in the middle of the night, 'cause I couldn't sleep,
[01:03:34.820 --> 01:03:36.700]   it said, you know, you really should,
[01:03:36.700 --> 01:03:38.100]   it's nagging you.
[01:03:38.100 --> 01:03:39.020]   (laughing)
[01:03:39.020 --> 01:03:40.980]   You should really be asleep.
[01:03:40.980 --> 01:03:43.060]   - Like don't leave. - They'll go behind the bed
[01:03:43.060 --> 01:03:44.580]   and this will pour it's phone.
[01:03:44.580 --> 01:03:46.340]   (laughing)
[01:03:46.340 --> 01:03:48.180]   - I can't sleep, what do you want me to do?
[01:03:48.180 --> 01:03:50.780]   - I can't sleep. - I can't sleep there.
[01:03:50.780 --> 01:03:52.660]   - I'm sorry, Lisa. - What, what, what?
[01:03:52.660 --> 01:03:55.020]   - Exactly. - I'm sorry, Leo.
[01:03:55.020 --> 01:03:57.700]   You've locked it through YouTube way too much.
[01:03:57.700 --> 01:03:59.100]   You should stop. - Stop.
[01:03:59.100 --> 01:04:03.740]   - Shameless plug, I just started a new podcast
[01:04:03.740 --> 01:04:06.260]   called Raising a Ninja in the first episode,
[01:04:06.260 --> 01:04:09.340]   I was talking about devices in my daughter.
[01:04:09.340 --> 01:04:10.900]   And my daughter is 11 years old,
[01:04:10.900 --> 01:04:12.820]   she's had a phone since she was four.
[01:04:12.820 --> 01:04:15.500]   She can regulate and control herself
[01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:19.900]   and has an extreme amount of resilience
[01:04:19.900 --> 01:04:21.260]   when it comes to doing things too often.
[01:04:21.260 --> 01:04:22.060]   You know why?
[01:04:22.060 --> 01:04:24.180]   Because I spent time with her, I talked to her,
[01:04:24.180 --> 01:04:26.900]   I show her how to use devices and the apps and the games
[01:04:26.900 --> 01:04:29.020]   and she doesn't have an addiction.
[01:04:29.020 --> 01:04:31.820]   When she gets in trouble, I take her phone two or three days,
[01:04:31.820 --> 01:04:33.340]   she doesn't even ask her phone back.
[01:04:33.340 --> 01:04:35.780]   She's not addicted to it because we've set these things
[01:04:35.780 --> 01:04:37.900]   in line to keep under control.
[01:04:37.900 --> 01:04:40.220]   I don't, people know me, I don't be tweeting all the time.
[01:04:40.220 --> 01:04:42.340]   I don't need my podcast all the time I was supposed to.
[01:04:42.340 --> 01:04:44.060]   'Cause sometimes I gotta coach my kids,
[01:04:44.060 --> 01:04:45.420]   spend my time, live their life.
[01:04:45.420 --> 01:04:48.060]   The last thing I need is this phone wasting my battery,
[01:04:48.060 --> 01:04:49.860]   telling me that I'm wasting my battery,
[01:04:49.860 --> 01:04:50.940]   looking at Instagram.
[01:04:50.940 --> 01:04:53.660]   I'm looking at Instagram because I've been in the bathroom
[01:04:53.660 --> 01:04:56.460]   for an hour and a half and I need to keep scrolling.
[01:04:56.460 --> 01:04:59.100]   I don't need you to tell me how long I've been in the bathroom.
[01:04:59.100 --> 01:04:59.940]   Okay?
[01:04:59.940 --> 01:05:03.300]   I don't need you to tell me how long I've been watching podcast.
[01:05:03.300 --> 01:05:06.220]   I listen to a show, watching Uncle Leo on Twitter.
[01:05:06.220 --> 01:05:09.420]   Can't just junk off my phone, wasting my battery.
[01:05:09.420 --> 01:05:11.820]   - It doesn't hurt to have it, does it?
[01:05:11.820 --> 01:05:14.180]   - You don't need that, but there's so many people
[01:05:14.180 --> 01:05:15.380]   that are addicted to it.
[01:05:15.380 --> 01:05:19.940]   - I think he's lucky that his daughter is sensible,
[01:05:19.940 --> 01:05:22.740]   but there's lots of kids who could do all the same parenting
[01:05:22.740 --> 01:05:25.860]   and they'd be spending all their time playing Fortnite.
[01:05:25.860 --> 01:05:28.020]   - And I can remember a time-tone alcoholic,
[01:05:28.020 --> 01:05:29.660]   hey, you shouldn't have another drink.
[01:05:29.660 --> 01:05:30.500]   - That worked.
[01:05:30.500 --> 01:05:32.340]   - It's supposed to be if you shouldn't smoke before we,
[01:05:32.340 --> 01:05:33.700]   no cigarettes are bad for you.
[01:05:33.700 --> 01:05:35.300]   You know you shouldn't smoke them.
[01:05:35.300 --> 01:05:38.420]   Let me run off the list of addictions that people listen to
[01:05:38.420 --> 01:05:41.180]   because they're phone game a charm every five seconds
[01:05:41.180 --> 01:05:43.060]   and I'm bleeding, you've been on here too long.
[01:05:43.060 --> 01:05:46.060]   That's ridiculous, it's dumb, and the lessons for kids,
[01:05:46.060 --> 01:05:46.900]   it's not gonna work.
[01:05:46.900 --> 01:05:48.740]   Uncle Leo just told you, he said no,
[01:05:48.740 --> 01:05:50.860]   his facial recognition, and the light off brightness
[01:05:50.860 --> 01:05:53.060]   makes the Lord of the day.
[01:05:53.060 --> 01:05:55.060]   - I can't get it to recognize me.
[01:05:55.060 --> 01:05:56.340]   It won't recognize me.
[01:05:56.340 --> 01:05:59.180]   And so I have to, who Apple thumbs like that?
[01:05:59.180 --> 01:06:00.700]   Yeah, so go ahead and listen to the little charm.
[01:06:00.700 --> 01:06:02.460]   - That's why you need to grow a beard.
[01:06:02.460 --> 01:06:03.300]   - I grew a beard.
[01:06:03.300 --> 01:06:05.460]   - You grow a beard and it would recognize you.
[01:06:05.460 --> 01:06:07.460]   - Actually, you could make the case you're right on,
[01:06:07.460 --> 01:06:11.900]   that actually reason Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Google,
[01:06:11.900 --> 01:06:14.540]   and Apple all are doing this is because it makes them
[01:06:14.540 --> 01:06:17.260]   look good and they know perfectly well,
[01:06:17.260 --> 01:06:19.820]   it's not gonna reduce usage at all.
[01:06:19.820 --> 01:06:21.780]   - They're entire business model.
[01:06:21.780 --> 01:06:26.180]   Every single one of those businesses have a business model
[01:06:26.180 --> 01:06:31.100]   that is based on provoking engagement,
[01:06:31.100 --> 01:06:34.980]   provoking reactions, escalating engagement
[01:06:34.980 --> 01:06:36.380]   and reactions from people.
[01:06:36.380 --> 01:06:38.580]   That's where the money comes from.
[01:06:38.580 --> 01:06:43.580]   And so the idea that they're somehow going to stop you
[01:06:43.580 --> 01:06:49.260]   from doing that thing makes no economic sense whatsoever.
[01:06:49.260 --> 01:06:51.780]   - So what about France?
[01:06:53.460 --> 01:06:54.940]   (laughs)
[01:06:54.940 --> 01:06:55.780]   - I love it.
[01:06:55.780 --> 01:06:57.980]   They have wonderful wines.
[01:06:57.980 --> 01:07:00.980]   - French school children. - The French children
[01:07:00.980 --> 01:07:02.260]   are really fast.
[01:07:02.260 --> 01:07:05.820]   - French school children up to the age of 15
[01:07:05.820 --> 01:07:08.060]   will have to leave their smartphone switched off
[01:07:08.060 --> 01:07:09.300]   or at home.
[01:07:09.300 --> 01:07:11.380]   This is a national law.
[01:07:11.380 --> 01:07:16.420]   It was a campaign promise by President Macron
[01:07:16.420 --> 01:07:19.140]   and it's now a reality.
[01:07:19.140 --> 01:07:22.420]   In France, the schools could make exceptions
[01:07:22.420 --> 01:07:25.420]   for pedagogical use, extracurricular activities
[01:07:25.420 --> 01:07:28.100]   or disabled pupils, but for the most part,
[01:07:28.100 --> 01:07:31.900]   kids will not be able to bring smartphones to class.
[01:07:31.900 --> 01:07:33.900]   Now that seems like a good idea.
[01:07:33.900 --> 01:07:34.740]   - I dig it.
[01:07:34.740 --> 01:07:39.700]   - In my district, different schools are different.
[01:07:39.700 --> 01:07:42.420]   Auto-imp until middle school,
[01:07:42.420 --> 01:07:45.060]   even if you have a phone on you're not allowed to have it on
[01:07:45.060 --> 01:07:46.540]   in your classroom, it has to be--
[01:07:46.540 --> 01:07:47.860]   - Yeah, they'll take it, right?
[01:07:47.860 --> 01:07:50.300]   If it rings, it's gone.
[01:07:50.300 --> 01:07:52.420]   - Yeah, yes, that.
[01:07:52.420 --> 01:07:53.260]   It rings, it's gone.
[01:07:53.260 --> 01:07:56.020]   Once you get into sixth grade, they use their phones
[01:07:56.020 --> 01:07:59.500]   or they give the kids tablets for as their calculator.
[01:07:59.500 --> 01:08:02.220]   They run apps on for the classes and things of that nature.
[01:08:02.220 --> 01:08:04.780]   So the way our setup is,
[01:08:04.780 --> 01:08:06.140]   the cities and Chromebooks, we use tablets,
[01:08:06.140 --> 01:08:07.300]   so it's the same thing.
[01:08:07.300 --> 01:08:09.300]   The kids are using the IMS to talk to each other
[01:08:09.300 --> 01:08:11.020]   in class or whatever they're doing.
[01:08:11.020 --> 01:08:12.500]   So taking it away is great and all,
[01:08:12.500 --> 01:08:13.620]   but we live in America.
[01:08:13.620 --> 01:08:14.860]   This is not France.
[01:08:14.860 --> 01:08:17.900]   My daughter has an Apple Watch on her
[01:08:17.900 --> 01:08:19.540]   and her teacher has been instructed
[01:08:19.540 --> 01:08:21.780]   no matter what, she's not allowed to take this from her
[01:08:21.780 --> 01:08:23.100]   because in case of a school shooting,
[01:08:23.100 --> 01:08:24.660]   my daughter can hit the SOS button
[01:08:24.660 --> 01:08:26.620]   and call me and call to please and let me know.
[01:08:26.620 --> 01:08:29.540]   So she has to have that device on her 24/7, 365
[01:08:29.540 --> 01:08:31.820]   and I feel like taking phones away from kids in America
[01:08:31.820 --> 01:08:33.540]   is not a good thing because we have other things
[01:08:33.540 --> 01:08:35.940]   to worry about besides his playing Fortnite
[01:08:35.940 --> 01:08:37.100]   in the middle of class.
[01:08:37.100 --> 01:08:39.460]   And if that's up to the teacher to handle their business
[01:08:39.460 --> 01:08:41.780]   and make sure that the kids aren't on their phones
[01:08:41.780 --> 01:08:43.620]   because if the teacher's paying attention to the kids,
[01:08:43.620 --> 01:08:45.260]   the kids gotta be paying attention to the teacher.
[01:08:45.260 --> 01:08:46.900]   It's really simple.
[01:08:46.900 --> 01:08:48.220]   - Okay, that's fair.
[01:08:48.220 --> 01:08:51.020]   I never even thought about it that way,
[01:08:51.020 --> 01:08:54.180]   but considering how bad things have gotten in the schools
[01:08:54.180 --> 01:08:56.700]   here in this country, that makes total sense.
[01:08:56.700 --> 01:08:59.220]   - It's interesting because the argument in France,
[01:08:59.220 --> 01:09:02.220]   exactly parallels our argument here,
[01:09:02.220 --> 01:09:04.860]   the opponents, Macron's opponents say,
[01:09:04.860 --> 01:09:07.260]   this is purely cosmetic.
[01:09:07.260 --> 01:09:09.420]   It's not gonna change behavior.
[01:09:09.420 --> 01:09:10.780]   It makes people feel good,
[01:09:10.780 --> 01:09:13.060]   but kids are still gonna use phones.
[01:09:13.060 --> 01:09:17.860]   So having a law is just, it's for show.
[01:09:17.860 --> 01:09:19.740]   - Kind of what we were just talking about.
[01:09:19.740 --> 01:09:21.260]   - And it's easier to control in France
[01:09:21.260 --> 01:09:23.180]   'cause it's a small place.
[01:09:23.180 --> 01:09:24.900]   - It's not that small.
[01:09:24.900 --> 01:09:27.100]   - And compare to the United States from America.
[01:09:27.100 --> 01:09:28.660]   (laughing)
[01:09:28.660 --> 01:09:32.020]   - Could we ever, I mean, not that a Congress
[01:09:32.020 --> 01:09:33.180]   is able to pass anything,
[01:09:33.180 --> 01:09:35.700]   but would you think we'd ever be able to get a law
[01:09:35.700 --> 01:09:36.540]   like that in the US?
[01:09:36.540 --> 01:09:37.580]   I don't think so.
[01:09:37.580 --> 01:09:38.580]   - We can't get a blanket.
[01:09:38.580 --> 01:09:40.820]   I don't know if there's one blanket law besides
[01:09:40.820 --> 01:09:43.700]   don't kill somebody that we have in this country.
[01:09:43.700 --> 01:09:44.540]   - That's a good point.
[01:09:44.540 --> 01:09:45.540]   - Different states, different states,
[01:09:45.540 --> 01:09:46.380]   different states, different folks.
[01:09:46.380 --> 01:09:50.300]   I don't, again, I feel like it can even in Florida,
[01:09:50.300 --> 01:09:51.140]   you've got the standard of ground.
[01:09:51.140 --> 01:09:52.060]   - You can kill somebody.
[01:09:52.060 --> 01:09:53.580]   Yeah, so yeah, yeah.
[01:09:53.580 --> 01:09:54.740]   - So there you go.
[01:09:54.740 --> 01:09:57.940]   America.
[01:09:57.940 --> 01:09:58.780]   - America.
[01:09:58.780 --> 01:10:00.660]   All right.
[01:10:00.660 --> 01:10:03.020]   - You're gonna get some emails this week.
[01:10:03.020 --> 01:10:05.020]   - Oh man, I know, I'm just, you know,
[01:10:05.020 --> 01:10:06.300]   what are you gonna do?
[01:10:06.300 --> 01:10:07.500]   - It always happens when I'm on, no,
[01:10:07.500 --> 01:10:09.340]   it's a horrible situation, I apologize.
[01:10:09.340 --> 01:10:11.620]   - No, we love you, and it's okay.
[01:10:11.620 --> 01:10:13.420]   - I know why you love me.
[01:10:13.420 --> 01:10:16.340]   Did you just take a shot of whiskey?
[01:10:16.340 --> 01:10:19.500]   - Is that an amp-pruiter or is that, is that medicinal?
[01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:21.740]   (laughing)
[01:10:21.740 --> 01:10:24.980]   - Ant's got the important staples, popcorn.
[01:10:24.980 --> 01:10:25.820]   - Whenever.
[01:10:25.820 --> 01:10:26.660]   - And brown liquor.
[01:10:26.660 --> 01:10:29.220]   - And the podcasting, whenever I'm editing photos
[01:10:29.220 --> 01:10:34.220]   or video, I always have music and/or a good old drama scotch.
[01:10:34.220 --> 01:10:37.860]   - I thought I saw that.
[01:10:37.860 --> 01:10:40.420]   Now that explains your smooth voice.
[01:10:40.420 --> 01:10:44.140]   How nice, because it's just, I should try that.
[01:10:44.140 --> 01:10:45.180]   - That's just how I roll.
[01:10:45.180 --> 01:10:46.380]   - That's nice. - Comforting.
[01:10:46.380 --> 01:10:47.220]   - That's nice.
[01:10:47.220 --> 01:10:51.580]   - Popcorn and Brown liquor, our show title today.
[01:10:51.580 --> 01:10:56.580]   Actually, I was thinking of making it the title
[01:10:56.580 --> 01:11:00.260]   of this blog post by Nick here on his Pixel Envy blog,
[01:11:00.260 --> 01:11:02.700]   but then I realized it's not polite.
[01:11:02.700 --> 01:11:07.700]   He calls it, you could show it, I guess, the BS web.
[01:11:07.700 --> 01:11:10.060]   And he actually raises some really good points.
[01:11:10.060 --> 01:11:12.460]   We'll talk about that in just a little bit.
[01:11:12.460 --> 01:11:14.780]   Before we go on.
[01:11:14.780 --> 01:11:19.340]   Let me play, look, it should be a good time to play our house.
[01:11:19.340 --> 01:11:21.540]   Dvorak always called our house ad,
[01:11:21.540 --> 01:11:23.340]   our promo for the week on Twitch.
[01:11:23.340 --> 01:11:27.580]   And then we'll come back with more from our esteemed panel.
[01:11:27.580 --> 01:11:29.060]   If you missed anything this week,
[01:11:29.060 --> 01:11:31.100]   you missed some good stuff, watch.
[01:11:31.100 --> 01:11:33.420]   - Previously on Twitch.
[01:11:33.420 --> 01:11:35.340]   - You know, we have to continue the tradition here.
[01:11:35.340 --> 01:11:37.100]   So I guess I'll just ask you,
[01:11:37.100 --> 01:11:39.020]   Alex, can you tell us the just main topic
[01:11:39.020 --> 01:11:40.100]   of the show for today?
[01:11:40.100 --> 01:11:43.140]   - I don't really remember, but what do you think it is?
[01:11:43.140 --> 01:11:43.980]   I think it was--
[01:11:43.980 --> 01:11:45.180]   - Father Robert.
[01:11:45.180 --> 01:11:46.580]   - We think it's networking.
[01:11:46.580 --> 01:11:47.420]   - Fantastic.
[01:11:47.420 --> 01:11:49.500]   It's great to see Pride to be there.
[01:11:49.500 --> 01:11:50.740]   - This week in law.
[01:11:50.740 --> 01:11:53.300]   - If you are traveling to Egypt,
[01:11:53.300 --> 01:11:56.820]   do not complain about your experiences there on social media
[01:11:56.820 --> 01:11:58.220]   in any way, shape, or form.
[01:11:58.220 --> 01:12:00.860]   A woman vacation tourism in Egypt,
[01:12:00.860 --> 01:12:02.580]   and didn't have a very good time.
[01:12:02.580 --> 01:12:06.300]   And she complained she was subjected to sexual harassment.
[01:12:06.300 --> 01:12:09.460]   She complained about various aspects of the country.
[01:12:09.460 --> 01:12:12.660]   Government officials ultimately fighting her guilty
[01:12:12.660 --> 01:12:15.340]   of deliberately spreading false rumors
[01:12:15.340 --> 01:12:16.900]   that would harm society.
[01:12:16.900 --> 01:12:20.460]   She has been sentenced to eight years in prison.
[01:12:20.460 --> 01:12:23.220]   - Do we need to be considering everything we post now
[01:12:23.220 --> 01:12:25.900]   on social media and what effects it might have
[01:12:25.900 --> 01:12:29.340]   if we were to leave the country and go to some other country?
[01:12:29.340 --> 01:12:30.620]   - All about Android.
[01:12:30.620 --> 01:12:32.020]   - This is a Lenovo Smart Display,
[01:12:32.020 --> 01:12:37.020]   and it is the first Google Assistant with display device.
[01:12:37.020 --> 01:12:38.860]   There's plenty more coming out this summer.
[01:12:38.860 --> 01:12:41.060]   This is just kind of the first wave.
[01:12:41.060 --> 01:12:43.460]   - Yeah, this bamboo back really makes me want to like
[01:12:43.460 --> 01:12:44.780]   etch something into it.
[01:12:44.780 --> 01:12:45.780]   - Please don't do that.
[01:12:45.780 --> 01:12:47.380]   - What is happening? - Oh, wow.
[01:12:47.380 --> 01:12:49.860]   - Burkh has come through. - Well, you asked Burkh
[01:12:49.860 --> 01:12:51.300]   for a knife, of course he's going to come.
[01:12:51.300 --> 01:12:52.140]   What are you doing?
[01:12:52.140 --> 01:12:53.820]   - No, I'm just kidding, I won't do that.
[01:12:53.820 --> 01:12:55.780]   - Is that joke really far, Jason?
[01:12:55.780 --> 01:12:58.620]   - I'm happy I'm not in studio with my hardware this week.
[01:12:58.620 --> 01:12:59.980]   - This is your brain.
[01:12:59.980 --> 01:13:01.540]   This is your brain on Twitter.
[01:13:01.540 --> 01:13:02.860]   Any questions?
[01:13:02.860 --> 01:13:05.180]   - We actually got a little bit of a time
[01:13:05.180 --> 01:13:08.300]   with that new Lenovo Google Assistant.
[01:13:08.300 --> 01:13:10.420]   And I was a little disappointed,
[01:13:10.420 --> 01:13:11.780]   and we're going to have to do more reviewing.
[01:13:11.780 --> 01:13:13.860]   Jason's going to have a review for us.
[01:13:13.860 --> 01:13:16.740]   We showed it off on the new screen savers yesterday.
[01:13:16.740 --> 01:13:18.700]   It doesn't seem to have all the capabilities
[01:13:18.700 --> 01:13:21.060]   of a Google Home device.
[01:13:21.060 --> 01:13:22.860]   It won't do some of the things that you could do
[01:13:22.860 --> 01:13:24.340]   with the Google Home, which really disappoints me
[01:13:24.340 --> 01:13:25.940]   because it's kind of awesome.
[01:13:25.940 --> 01:13:29.660]   It's a eight or 10 inch screen that could be used as a TV.
[01:13:29.660 --> 01:13:31.980]   You could watch Netflix on Amazon Prime,
[01:13:31.980 --> 01:13:33.540]   except none of that worked.
[01:13:33.540 --> 01:13:34.780]   - I want it really bad.
[01:13:34.780 --> 01:13:35.940]   - Yeah, but don't get it.
[01:13:35.940 --> 01:13:36.980]   - I'm hoping for updates.
[01:13:36.980 --> 01:13:39.460]   Well, I'm going to get it from you, like we discussed.
[01:13:39.460 --> 01:13:40.940]   - Oh, I'll just hand down.
[01:13:40.940 --> 01:13:41.900]   - Don't be an update.
[01:13:41.900 --> 01:13:42.740]   Don't be an update.
[01:13:42.740 --> 01:13:43.580]   Don't worry about it.
[01:13:43.580 --> 01:13:45.060]   - It's 249 bucks for the 10 inch.
[01:13:45.060 --> 01:13:47.260]   That's the one I would get because it's like a kitchen.
[01:13:47.260 --> 01:13:48.820]   It's like a TV.
[01:13:48.820 --> 01:13:51.020]   And then you can do all the other stuff, the Google stuff.
[01:13:51.020 --> 01:13:52.740]   - I've been waiting for Google Home with a screen on it.
[01:13:52.740 --> 01:13:54.660]   So I need my life.
[01:13:54.660 --> 01:13:57.900]   I've heard it over to the Google,
[01:13:57.900 --> 01:13:59.580]   and she's my friend.
[01:13:59.580 --> 01:14:00.420]   - Yeah.
[01:14:00.420 --> 01:14:02.420]   I just, I wish this were,
[01:14:02.420 --> 01:14:06.220]   I just assumed that Lenovo would use the same exact software.
[01:14:06.220 --> 01:14:08.220]   But a parent, I don't know if they're doing their own servers
[01:14:08.220 --> 01:14:09.540]   or what, but it's not the same.
[01:14:09.540 --> 01:14:12.860]   It's very much like the Fire Cube
[01:14:12.860 --> 01:14:15.180]   doesn't do all of Amazon's Echo stuff,
[01:14:15.180 --> 01:14:16.900]   which is also weird to me.
[01:14:16.900 --> 01:14:18.100]   - Which is very silly.
[01:14:18.100 --> 01:14:19.780]   - Yeah, Sam, it's from Amazon.
[01:14:19.780 --> 01:14:22.660]   - And it's a more powerful, but I don't get that at all.
[01:14:22.660 --> 01:14:24.860]   That makes no sense to me.
[01:14:24.860 --> 01:14:27.420]   - Well, it's good for reviewers
[01:14:27.420 --> 01:14:30.060]   because it means we need to help people
[01:14:30.060 --> 01:14:31.420]   make the right buying decisions.
[01:14:31.420 --> 01:14:32.780]   These things are not obvious companies
[01:14:32.780 --> 01:14:34.700]   are not telling you what they're doing.
[01:14:34.700 --> 01:14:35.580]   - Yeah.
[01:14:35.580 --> 01:14:39.060]   - Our show today brought to you by LastPass.
[01:14:39.060 --> 01:14:41.500]   Yes, I know you use, you use, right.
[01:14:41.500 --> 01:14:43.060]   Come on.
[01:14:43.060 --> 01:14:45.820]   Everybody uses LastPass Yotto.
[01:14:45.820 --> 01:14:49.300]   It is the password vault that means you're more secure
[01:14:49.300 --> 01:14:51.020]   because you're using strong passwords.
[01:14:51.020 --> 01:14:52.500]   You don't have to remember them.
[01:14:52.500 --> 01:14:54.300]   It generates them for you.
[01:14:54.300 --> 01:14:56.700]   It'll, it's securely stores all the information.
[01:14:56.700 --> 01:14:58.900]   I use LastPass to keep my driver's license,
[01:14:58.900 --> 01:15:02.540]   my social security, all our corporate information.
[01:15:02.540 --> 01:15:06.740]   I mean, it is really secure storage
[01:15:06.740 --> 01:15:09.500]   for everything, especially passwords.
[01:15:09.500 --> 01:15:13.060]   But have you thought about LastPass in your business?
[01:15:13.060 --> 01:15:16.580]   If this was something I was just blind to,
[01:15:16.580 --> 01:15:19.140]   remember when you're using passwords in business
[01:15:19.140 --> 01:15:22.220]   and you are, you're giving employees access to,
[01:15:22.220 --> 01:15:24.860]   I don't know, your QuickBooks, your bank account,
[01:15:24.860 --> 01:15:27.940]   your website, your storage, all the stuff,
[01:15:27.940 --> 01:15:30.220]   they have access to.
[01:15:30.220 --> 01:15:32.060]   And that really can be a problem.
[01:15:32.060 --> 01:15:33.100]   I've learned my lesson.
[01:15:33.100 --> 01:15:35.780]   I just kind of said, that's fine, whatever.
[01:15:35.780 --> 01:15:37.580]   I learned my lesson when one of our engineers
[01:15:37.580 --> 01:15:39.980]   put all our passwords up on a public website
[01:15:39.980 --> 01:15:42.220]   'cause he couldn't remember them.
[01:15:42.220 --> 01:15:43.060]   Oops.
[01:15:43.060 --> 01:15:44.220]   Oops.
[01:15:44.220 --> 01:15:47.220]   That's when we went to LastPass Enterprise.
[01:15:47.220 --> 01:15:50.460]   But the nice thing is when you're using LastPass in business,
[01:15:50.460 --> 01:15:51.860]   you can completely control it.
[01:15:51.860 --> 01:15:53.820]   You have over 100 policies.
[01:15:53.820 --> 01:15:56.260]   You can get security reports.
[01:15:56.260 --> 01:15:57.940]   Your passwords are protected.
[01:15:57.940 --> 01:15:59.740]   You can share your QuickBooks passwords
[01:15:59.740 --> 01:16:01.900]   with the people who need access to it only.
[01:16:01.900 --> 01:16:03.660]   And you can even share it in a way that not only
[01:16:03.660 --> 01:16:05.140]   can they not change it, they can't even see it.
[01:16:05.140 --> 01:16:06.700]   So they log into the site,
[01:16:06.700 --> 01:16:08.300]   but they don't know what the password is.
[01:16:08.300 --> 01:16:10.300]   That's the kind of thing you need.
[01:16:10.300 --> 01:16:12.740]   It makes them generate strong passwords.
[01:16:12.740 --> 01:16:14.740]   We enforce one of the policies
[01:16:14.740 --> 01:16:17.500]   that we enforce is two-factor authentication.
[01:16:17.500 --> 01:16:21.940]   It protects the most important stuff in our business.
[01:16:21.940 --> 01:16:23.900]   Even if credentials end up being compromised
[01:16:23.900 --> 01:16:25.740]   through phishing attacks because we use two-factor,
[01:16:25.740 --> 01:16:27.260]   we require two-factor.
[01:16:27.260 --> 01:16:30.460]   Outsiders don't have access to our stuff.
[01:16:30.460 --> 01:16:32.580]   Employees can log into LastPass now
[01:16:32.580 --> 01:16:34.580]   with their Microsoft Active Directory.
[01:16:34.580 --> 01:16:37.540]   So if you've got AD and you've got credentials,
[01:16:37.540 --> 01:16:40.900]   then they really, literally only have to remember one password.
[01:16:40.900 --> 01:16:42.940]   They're AD password and they're in.
[01:16:42.940 --> 01:16:45.700]   We offer it as a benefit to our employees,
[01:16:45.700 --> 01:16:47.460]   a personal version of LastPass.
[01:16:47.460 --> 01:16:49.620]   And one of the nice things about LastPass Enterprise,
[01:16:49.620 --> 01:16:52.900]   one login gives you access both to your Enterprise account
[01:16:52.900 --> 01:16:56.300]   and to a completely separate, completely encrypted,
[01:16:56.300 --> 01:16:57.740]   separately, personal account.
[01:16:57.740 --> 01:16:59.020]   So you don't have to have two versions
[01:16:59.020 --> 01:17:00.260]   of LastPass running all the time.
[01:17:00.260 --> 01:17:01.260]   I really like that.
[01:17:01.260 --> 01:17:04.260]   LastPass for individuals is LastPass Premium,
[01:17:04.260 --> 01:17:06.740]   LastPass Families for the entire family.
[01:17:06.740 --> 01:17:08.660]   I'd love the sharing capability,
[01:17:08.660 --> 01:17:10.580]   both at home and at work.
[01:17:10.580 --> 01:17:13.180]   The engineering department can share all their passwords,
[01:17:13.180 --> 01:17:16.100]   but nobody else at work has access to them.
[01:17:16.100 --> 01:17:18.460]   And LastPass teams, if you have a small business
[01:17:18.460 --> 01:17:20.260]   for teams of 50 or a fewer,
[01:17:20.260 --> 01:17:21.660]   we use the LastPass Enterprise.
[01:17:21.660 --> 01:17:22.500]   It's awesome.
[01:17:22.500 --> 01:17:25.300]   We're so happy we have it.
[01:17:25.300 --> 01:17:30.300]   And when you realize that 81% of all breaches
[01:17:30.300 --> 01:17:33.740]   come from weak passwords or reused passwords,
[01:17:33.740 --> 01:17:35.260]   you realize how important this is.
[01:17:35.260 --> 01:17:39.980]   Protect your business with LastPass.
[01:17:39.980 --> 01:17:42.820]   It's celebrated its 10th anniversary in July.
[01:17:42.820 --> 01:17:44.500]   Happy anniversary, LastPass.
[01:17:44.500 --> 01:17:46.940]   I've been using it practically that long.
[01:17:46.940 --> 01:17:49.300]   I know we got Steve Gibson using it about six years ago
[01:17:49.300 --> 01:17:52.740]   when he interviewed the founder of LastPass, Joe Seagrest,
[01:17:52.740 --> 01:17:54.660]   and he was able to look at the code and he said,
[01:17:54.660 --> 01:17:55.860]   "Yeah, this is the right thing.
[01:17:55.860 --> 01:17:57.340]   This is the right way to do it."
[01:17:57.340 --> 01:18:02.340]   LastPass.com/twit, more than 13 million people trust LastPass.
[01:18:02.340 --> 01:18:05.300]   It's the number one most preferred password manager.
[01:18:05.300 --> 01:18:10.300]   And now using business2lastpass.com/twit.
[01:18:10.300 --> 01:18:13.740]   I just, I loved this article by Nick here
[01:18:13.740 --> 01:18:15.820]   just because I couldn't agree more.
[01:18:15.820 --> 01:18:18.780]   He calls it the BS web.
[01:18:18.780 --> 01:18:20.100]   But what he's talking about is,
[01:18:20.100 --> 01:18:23.500]   as our internet connections have sped up,
[01:18:23.500 --> 01:18:27.300]   access to websites has slowed down
[01:18:27.300 --> 01:18:29.700]   because there's so much junk.
[01:18:29.700 --> 01:18:31.260]   He says, "The average internet connection
[01:18:31.260 --> 01:18:34.100]   "on the United States about six times as fast as it was
[01:18:34.100 --> 01:18:35.620]   "10 years ago.
[01:18:35.620 --> 01:18:38.540]   "But instead of making it faster to browse,
[01:18:38.540 --> 01:18:42.540]   "we're simply occupying that extra bandwidth with more junk."
[01:18:42.540 --> 01:18:45.500]   In 2006, partly it's watching movies,
[01:18:45.500 --> 01:18:47.020]   Apple added movies to iTunes Store,
[01:18:47.020 --> 01:18:48.700]   but really the real problem is,
[01:18:48.700 --> 01:18:52.580]   well, here's an example, the CNN article.
[01:18:53.580 --> 01:18:56.340]   Which took 20 seconds to load.
[01:18:56.340 --> 01:18:59.700]   11 web fonts totaling 414 kilobytes.
[01:18:59.700 --> 01:19:02.940]   Four style sheets, 315 kilobytes.
[01:19:02.940 --> 01:19:05.820]   This is one page, 20 frames,
[01:19:05.820 --> 01:19:09.340]   29 XML HTTP requests toling 500 kilobytes.
[01:19:09.340 --> 01:19:14.140]   100 scripts, several megabytes worth.
[01:19:14.140 --> 01:19:17.220]   And on and on and on.
[01:19:17.220 --> 01:19:19.980]   And we've all noticed this.
[01:19:19.980 --> 01:19:21.420]   It is--
[01:19:21.420 --> 01:19:23.140]   - All about revenue streams, sir.
[01:19:23.140 --> 01:19:24.260]   - It's so sad.
[01:19:24.260 --> 01:19:26.340]   And Ed Bond, I know you remember this
[01:19:26.340 --> 01:19:30.100]   as we got more bandwidth faster processors, more RAM.
[01:19:30.100 --> 01:19:33.700]   It just meant programs bloated up, right?
[01:19:33.700 --> 01:19:34.820]   - Right, right.
[01:19:34.820 --> 01:19:37.060]   It's the paradox of Moore's law.
[01:19:37.060 --> 01:19:40.980]   And this is sort of the cousin of the Moore's law paradox
[01:19:40.980 --> 01:19:46.060]   with an evil twin hanging around there.
[01:19:46.060 --> 01:19:49.940]   - I guess we all agree.
[01:19:49.940 --> 01:19:51.820]   It's not like there's any controversy here.
[01:19:51.820 --> 01:19:55.140]   It's not like also there's anything you didn't know here.
[01:19:55.140 --> 01:19:57.020]   But I do like the idea.
[01:19:57.020 --> 01:20:00.740]   And maybe there's something to be said for,
[01:20:00.740 --> 01:20:03.180]   bring this to people's attention and try to slim it down.
[01:20:03.180 --> 01:20:06.900]   There was Google AMP, he said, that didn't do anything.
[01:20:06.900 --> 01:20:11.900]   - But we're back to an analog of the same thing
[01:20:11.900 --> 01:20:15.740]   we were talking about 15 minutes ago.
[01:20:15.740 --> 01:20:20.740]   The economic model of the web for better or worse,
[01:20:20.740 --> 01:20:25.620]   mostly worse, is based on the idea
[01:20:25.620 --> 01:20:27.700]   that everything has to be free.
[01:20:27.700 --> 01:20:30.020]   And for everything to be free,
[01:20:30.020 --> 01:20:32.940]   it costs a lot of money to have these people
[01:20:32.940 --> 01:20:34.500]   writing these things.
[01:20:34.500 --> 01:20:37.020]   Those servers cost money.
[01:20:37.020 --> 01:20:38.740]   All that stuff costs a lot of money.
[01:20:38.740 --> 01:20:41.300]   And yet everyone wants them for free.
[01:20:41.300 --> 01:20:46.300]   So pages are cluttered up with terrible, ugly, stupid ads.
[01:20:46.300 --> 01:20:53.900]   And tracking pixels and things that are just
[01:20:53.900 --> 01:20:59.460]   building dossiers on us that have the potential
[01:20:59.460 --> 01:21:02.540]   to ruin our lives.
[01:21:02.540 --> 01:21:06.980]   And there's no end in sight to it.
[01:21:06.980 --> 01:21:10.420]   And so now, and it's become an arms war
[01:21:10.420 --> 01:21:14.260]   between the people building the crappy ads
[01:21:14.260 --> 01:21:17.300]   and surveillance systems and us.
[01:21:17.300 --> 01:21:19.420]   And I know in the essay, he mentions,
[01:21:19.420 --> 01:21:21.140]   the rise in ad blockers now.
[01:21:21.140 --> 01:21:25.700]   Well, now the next level of the arms race
[01:21:25.700 --> 01:21:28.460]   is ad blocker blockers.
[01:21:28.460 --> 01:21:31.660]   And so you go to a site and hi,
[01:21:31.660 --> 01:21:33.460]   I see you're using an ad blocker.
[01:21:33.460 --> 01:21:34.820]   Would you like to whitelist this?
[01:21:34.820 --> 01:21:37.860]   And now you can either,
[01:21:37.860 --> 01:21:40.820]   I like the ones that say, no,
[01:21:40.820 --> 01:21:45.820]   I'm just going to continue using my ad blocker.
[01:21:45.820 --> 01:21:48.660]   But others, and then there's the others that say,
[01:21:48.660 --> 01:21:52.420]   no, we're gonna block you right back.
[01:21:52.420 --> 01:21:53.900]   You can't come through.
[01:21:53.900 --> 01:21:55.540]   And those are the ones that,
[01:21:55.540 --> 01:22:02.060]   I'll pay to get this crap off there.
[01:22:03.780 --> 01:22:07.020]   Especially the tabula outbrain.
[01:22:07.020 --> 01:22:09.500]   Oh, God, that's the wrong content.
[01:22:09.500 --> 01:22:11.300]   You know, that stuff is,
[01:22:11.300 --> 01:22:14.700]   I mean, that's the garbage.
[01:22:14.700 --> 01:22:19.700]   And you're just having that stuff thrown in your face.
[01:22:19.700 --> 01:22:24.740]   Every page that you visit, it's exhausting.
[01:22:24.740 --> 01:22:28.980]   I call BS on that stat of 20 seconds,
[01:22:28.980 --> 01:22:32.420]   Losing that I just loaded it on Chrome,
[01:22:32.420 --> 01:22:37.060]   Outlook, Firefox, my iPhone, my L,
[01:22:37.060 --> 01:22:40.900]   the Nova, LG, it took like five seconds on all of them.
[01:22:40.900 --> 01:22:42.340]   They have a text version too for the site.
[01:22:42.340 --> 01:22:44.820]   I mean, what kind of network connection,
[01:22:44.820 --> 01:22:45.660]   what are they using?
[01:22:45.660 --> 01:22:47.820]   It took 20 seconds to load the paper.
[01:22:47.820 --> 01:22:50.500]   I haven't had that problem or that issue.
[01:22:50.500 --> 01:22:52.500]   Maybe it's the youth of my internet.
[01:22:52.500 --> 01:22:56.100]   I haven't had any functionality problems over on my end.
[01:22:56.100 --> 01:22:57.660]   - Do you run an ad blocker though?
[01:22:57.660 --> 01:22:59.100]   - I'm always, I do not.
[01:22:59.100 --> 01:23:01.460]   - Okay.
[01:23:01.460 --> 01:23:02.940]   - I do not. The only thing that I run,
[01:23:02.940 --> 01:23:05.020]   which I cannot run when I do the show,
[01:23:05.020 --> 01:23:07.820]   is my proxy to lock me up
[01:23:07.820 --> 01:23:09.780]   and make it look like I'm in Brazil or something.
[01:23:09.780 --> 01:23:11.580]   - Do you do that?
[01:23:11.580 --> 01:23:12.420]   - Yeah.
[01:23:12.420 --> 01:23:13.500]   - Yeah, I took mine off only.
[01:23:13.500 --> 01:23:15.820]   - I told you I'm a white guy in New York.
[01:23:15.820 --> 01:23:17.580]   You think my internet ain't disguised
[01:23:17.580 --> 01:23:19.820]   in my nationality, not Disney?
[01:23:19.820 --> 01:23:22.780]   - So, is it a VPN or just a proxy?
[01:23:22.780 --> 01:23:24.820]   - It's a VPN in a proxy.
[01:23:24.820 --> 01:23:25.820]   I run on my own kind of--
[01:23:25.820 --> 01:23:28.260]   - All the time, you run that all the time?
[01:23:28.260 --> 01:23:29.260]   - Unless I'm on with you,
[01:23:29.260 --> 01:23:31.020]   'cause it won't let me chat with the people.
[01:23:31.020 --> 01:23:31.940]   And I'm a man of the people,
[01:23:31.940 --> 01:23:33.620]   so I gotta turn it off when I'm on Twitter.
[01:23:33.620 --> 01:23:34.940]   - That's interesting.
[01:23:34.940 --> 01:23:35.940]   - Huh.
[01:23:35.940 --> 01:23:40.780]   - I totally get the, having to have the ads
[01:23:40.780 --> 01:23:42.740]   and things like that on the site, you know.
[01:23:42.740 --> 01:23:43.980]   - I think we got a monetized--
[01:23:43.980 --> 01:23:46.820]   - It's a contributor tech republic right there.
[01:23:46.820 --> 01:23:51.220]   And I can invoice tech republic for a reason.
[01:23:51.220 --> 01:23:52.700]   It can pay me for it.
[01:23:52.700 --> 01:23:55.260]   And I know they gotta get their money somewhere to pay me.
[01:23:55.260 --> 01:23:57.580]   And that's one way to do it.
[01:23:57.580 --> 01:24:00.140]   You gotta have those ads.
[01:24:00.140 --> 01:24:02.140]   You know what's gonna fix everything?
[01:24:02.140 --> 01:24:03.180]   Blockchain.
[01:24:03.180 --> 01:24:05.980]   (laughing)
[01:24:05.980 --> 01:24:07.620]   - People still don't know it, Blockchain.
[01:24:07.620 --> 01:24:10.540]   - Nobody knows, that's why it's so popular.
[01:24:10.540 --> 01:24:12.980]   'Cause it's a techie sounding thing.
[01:24:12.980 --> 01:24:15.780]   And it's gotta be great 'cause I don't understand it.
[01:24:15.780 --> 01:24:19.620]   Actually, here's an article that comes from Bloomberg.
[01:24:19.620 --> 01:24:20.820]   I'm rating it from the LA Times
[01:24:20.820 --> 01:24:22.660]   because I can't use Bloomberg
[01:24:22.660 --> 01:24:24.380]   'cause I've used up my free articles.
[01:24:24.380 --> 01:24:27.580]   But the LA Times apparently doesn't have a paywall.
[01:24:28.540 --> 01:24:30.660]   According to Forrester Research,
[01:24:30.660 --> 01:24:36.380]   the number of sites claiming the use of Blockchain
[01:24:36.380 --> 01:24:40.300]   is gonna be, is a lot lower this year.
[01:24:40.300 --> 01:24:43.940]   That fewer and fewer people are talking about Blockchain.
[01:24:43.940 --> 01:24:46.340]   That it was, there was a lot of hype.
[01:24:46.340 --> 01:24:50.100]   Only 1% of chief information officers
[01:24:50.100 --> 01:24:53.100]   are planning any kind of Blockchain adoption.
[01:24:53.100 --> 01:24:58.180]   Nearly 80% of CIOs said they have no interest
[01:24:58.180 --> 01:24:59.820]   in Blockchain.
[01:24:59.820 --> 01:25:04.820]   - So Leo, I changed my Twitter bio about six months ago.
[01:25:04.820 --> 01:25:09.180]   And I said, you know, tech journalist,
[01:25:09.180 --> 01:25:11.320]   now with added Blockchain. (laughing)
[01:25:11.320 --> 01:25:12.180]   It's just a, you know.
[01:25:12.180 --> 01:25:14.180]   - And did your stock price go up 45%?
[01:25:14.180 --> 01:25:17.140]   - Just throw it, yeah, well, you know, I mean,
[01:25:17.140 --> 01:25:21.940]   what's 45% more than zero? (laughing)
[01:25:21.940 --> 01:25:24.940]   - Do you, you know, we were talking about,
[01:25:24.940 --> 01:25:28.460]   but here, wait, wait, let me just finish that thought.
[01:25:28.460 --> 01:25:32.700]   I now get so many PR pictures.
[01:25:32.700 --> 01:25:34.020]   - Oh no.
[01:25:34.020 --> 01:25:35.100]   - Blockchain people.
[01:25:35.100 --> 01:25:37.460]   In fact, I got invited last week, you know,
[01:25:37.460 --> 01:25:39.380]   and I said, we're, you know, we want you to come
[01:25:39.380 --> 01:25:42.300]   to a Blockchain conference in Hyderabad, India.
[01:25:42.300 --> 01:25:43.300]   We'll pay your way.
[01:25:43.300 --> 01:25:44.140]   - What?
[01:25:44.140 --> 01:25:45.460]   - Yeah.
[01:25:45.460 --> 01:25:48.180]   - Oh, let me put Blockchain in my bio.
[01:25:48.180 --> 01:25:49.860]   - I dare go to Hyderabad.
[01:25:49.860 --> 01:25:52.420]   - I wanna go to Hyderabad.
[01:25:52.420 --> 01:25:54.740]   I don't even know where it is, but I wanna go.
[01:25:54.740 --> 01:25:55.580]   - It's in India.
[01:25:55.580 --> 01:25:57.180]   - It's in India.
[01:25:57.180 --> 01:26:00.100]   - India, and you do not wanna go to India in August.
[01:26:00.100 --> 01:26:00.940]   - No.
[01:26:00.940 --> 01:26:04.140]   - Oh yeah, you're 100% right about that.
[01:26:04.140 --> 01:26:05.220]   - It makes you mind.
[01:26:05.220 --> 01:26:09.340]   - It makes New York in August look like a spa vacation,
[01:26:09.340 --> 01:26:13.180]   you know, so I said no to them, but seriously,
[01:26:13.180 --> 01:26:16.020]   I just added the word Blockchain to my Twitter bio,
[01:26:16.020 --> 01:26:21.020]   nothing else, and I am on so many PR lists now.
[01:26:21.020 --> 01:26:26.020]   And I got one the other day that I put on my,
[01:26:26.020 --> 01:26:29.060]   I shared it on my Twitter feed 'cause it was so funny.
[01:26:29.060 --> 01:26:34.060]   It says, you know, will the next Super Mario Brothers
[01:26:34.060 --> 01:26:39.860]   rainbow bright be enabled by the Blockchain?
[01:26:39.860 --> 01:26:40.700]   - What?
[01:26:40.700 --> 01:26:41.860]   - What?
[01:26:41.860 --> 01:26:43.340]   - Makes no sense whatsoever.
[01:26:43.340 --> 01:26:47.700]   - Exactly, I put that up on my Twitter feed.
[01:26:47.700 --> 01:26:50.620]   - Somebody sent you that as a pitch, a PR pitch.
[01:26:50.620 --> 01:26:52.620]   - As a PR pitch, I kid you not,
[01:26:52.620 --> 01:26:55.980]   and I should have kept reading so I could figure out
[01:26:55.980 --> 01:26:58.460]   what in God's name they were talking about, but--
[01:26:58.460 --> 01:26:59.300]   - Nah.
[01:26:59.300 --> 01:27:00.140]   - I don't think so.
[01:27:00.140 --> 01:27:01.220]   - Just couldn't.
[01:27:01.220 --> 01:27:02.060]   - Yeah.
[01:27:02.060 --> 01:27:02.900]   - Blah.
[01:27:02.900 --> 01:27:07.900]   - You know, they were talking about people,
[01:27:07.900 --> 01:27:10.340]   this was in the promo earlier in Egypt,
[01:27:10.340 --> 01:27:13.340]   tourists getting in trouble for tweeting negative comments
[01:27:13.340 --> 01:27:16.580]   ending up with eight years of jail time.
[01:27:16.580 --> 01:27:19.260]   There is a trend I think now to delete your Twitter history.
[01:27:19.260 --> 01:27:21.980]   James Gunn, of course, the director of the first two episodes
[01:27:21.980 --> 01:27:23.940]   of Guardians of the Galaxy,
[01:27:23.940 --> 01:27:27.820]   fired for inappropriate jokes he made in the early days
[01:27:27.820 --> 01:27:31.620]   of Twitter when it wasn't unusual to see inappropriate jokes.
[01:27:31.620 --> 01:27:34.820]   His cast is standing up for him saying,
[01:27:34.820 --> 01:27:37.140]   "You know, that's not the guy we know."
[01:27:37.140 --> 01:27:41.540]   - Glenn Greenwald just deleted his entire Twitter history,
[01:27:41.540 --> 01:27:45.140]   everything before 2016, he deleted.
[01:27:45.140 --> 01:27:47.700]   - I have a friend who's very well known in Hollywood
[01:27:47.700 --> 01:27:49.620]   and he sent me an email saying,
[01:27:49.620 --> 01:27:52.780]   "What's the best way to delete my Twitter history?"
[01:27:52.780 --> 01:27:55.940]   It's sad because people are very afraid
[01:27:55.940 --> 01:27:58.700]   that they said something six, eight, 10 years ago
[01:27:58.700 --> 01:28:02.620]   and that it can come back to haunt them.
[01:28:02.620 --> 01:28:03.900]   - It's not that sad.
[01:28:03.900 --> 01:28:09.780]   First of all, I can't deal with the gun thing
[01:28:09.780 --> 01:28:11.620]   and the protection of them 'cause I don't play around
[01:28:11.620 --> 01:28:14.660]   with kid jokes, I don't find it amusing on any level.
[01:28:14.660 --> 01:28:16.180]   You're a 40 year old man,
[01:28:16.180 --> 01:28:19.020]   there were more than one or two or three or five
[01:28:19.020 --> 01:28:21.580]   or six tweets on that subject and that topic.
[01:28:21.580 --> 01:28:23.060]   So I have no sympathy. - It was a little creepy.
[01:28:23.060 --> 01:28:24.980]   I agree with you. - I have no sympathy.
[01:28:24.980 --> 01:28:28.620]   - But there's no context for Twitter 2008
[01:28:28.620 --> 01:28:29.860]   or whatever it was.
[01:28:29.860 --> 01:28:32.100]   - There's context for a 40 year old man
[01:28:32.100 --> 01:28:34.540]   speaking in a public forum out to the world.
[01:28:34.540 --> 01:28:36.380]   That's my context, that's the situation.
[01:28:36.380 --> 01:28:38.220]   Other people will make jokes and different things
[01:28:38.220 --> 01:28:41.420]   and I get it, trust you me, I get on here
[01:28:41.420 --> 01:28:43.860]   and I try to bring levity to technology
[01:28:43.860 --> 01:28:45.260]   and I make all kinds of jokes
[01:28:45.260 --> 01:28:46.660]   and I goof off all the time.
[01:28:46.660 --> 01:28:48.300]   So as a person like that, I get it.
[01:28:48.300 --> 01:28:50.460]   I don't wanna see comedy go away.
[01:28:50.460 --> 01:28:53.180]   I don't wanna see the white comic get roasted
[01:28:53.180 --> 01:28:54.260]   for making a black joke.
[01:28:54.260 --> 01:28:55.940]   I don't wanna see the black comic get roasted
[01:28:55.940 --> 01:28:57.060]   for making an Asian joke.
[01:28:57.060 --> 01:29:00.540]   They're comics, I get jokes and I get making fun of ourselves
[01:29:00.540 --> 01:29:01.900]   as a people in a class.
[01:29:01.900 --> 01:29:04.780]   If you wanna delete your old tweets just to be safe,
[01:29:04.780 --> 01:29:06.460]   I don't feel like it's a sad thing
[01:29:06.460 --> 01:29:08.340]   'cause people say dumb things and really who cares
[01:29:08.340 --> 01:29:09.580]   what you said eight years ago
[01:29:09.580 --> 01:29:11.820]   'cause all you end up doing is something like Donald Trump.
[01:29:11.820 --> 01:29:14.020]   I like pancakes, man, I hate pancakes.
[01:29:14.020 --> 01:29:16.380]   Like so if you delete it, it's fine.
[01:29:16.380 --> 01:29:18.020]   Go ahead and do what you gotta do.
[01:29:18.020 --> 01:29:20.380]   But it's not something I feel sad over.
[01:29:20.380 --> 01:29:23.780]   It's something that if you feel that you need to delete it
[01:29:23.780 --> 01:29:27.260]   and you feel some sort of way about the things that you said
[01:29:27.260 --> 01:29:28.540]   and you're not that person,
[01:29:28.540 --> 01:29:29.380]   if you're not that person,
[01:29:29.380 --> 01:29:30.900]   then go ahead and delete your old tweets
[01:29:30.900 --> 01:29:32.540]   because as far as I'm concerned,
[01:29:32.540 --> 01:29:34.140]   it's hard to find the line.
[01:29:34.140 --> 01:29:36.100]   - Aren't you tempted to go back through your old tweets
[01:29:36.100 --> 01:29:37.660]   just to make sure?
[01:29:37.660 --> 01:29:39.380]   - Oh no, I say outlandish stuff today.
[01:29:39.380 --> 01:29:41.180]   - You stand by your tweets.
[01:29:41.180 --> 01:29:43.580]   - I said outlandish stuff three weeks ago,
[01:29:43.580 --> 01:29:45.260]   there was a guy making an argument with me
[01:29:45.260 --> 01:29:47.460]   and then the first thing he went and tweeted was,
[01:29:47.460 --> 01:29:49.740]   Uncle Leo, how could you have someone like this
[01:29:49.740 --> 01:29:51.260]   on your show and I'm like, well,
[01:29:51.260 --> 01:29:52.620]   he said something about my daughter
[01:29:52.620 --> 01:29:53.940]   and I ripped him apart for it.
[01:29:53.940 --> 01:29:55.420]   You can't talk about my childhood.
[01:29:55.420 --> 01:29:56.620]   - It's risky though, look at Sarah,
[01:29:56.620 --> 01:29:58.020]   look at Sarah John. - Back around.
[01:29:58.020 --> 01:29:58.860]   - Look at Sarah John.
[01:29:58.860 --> 01:30:02.740]   She's recently put on the New York Times editorial board
[01:30:02.740 --> 01:30:04.700]   and of course the first thing that happened
[01:30:04.700 --> 01:30:06.660]   is people went through her Twitter feed
[01:30:06.660 --> 01:30:10.300]   and she had been harassed for a long time
[01:30:10.300 --> 01:30:14.060]   for being an outspoken progressive feminist on Twitter
[01:30:14.060 --> 01:30:19.060]   and her choice in finding that was trolling the trolls back
[01:30:19.060 --> 01:30:24.380]   which like hashtag cancel white people
[01:30:24.380 --> 01:30:27.060]   and there was a huge amount of backlash around that.
[01:30:27.060 --> 01:30:28.580]   Now the New York Times to their credit
[01:30:28.580 --> 01:30:33.420]   as standards stood up for but still--
[01:30:33.420 --> 01:30:35.460]   - I wanna stop you right there, Leo.
[01:30:35.460 --> 01:30:37.900]   There was not a huge amount of pushback on that.
[01:30:37.900 --> 01:30:40.300]   There was an orchestrated campaign
[01:30:40.300 --> 01:30:42.860]   from a bunch of professional right wing trolls,
[01:30:42.860 --> 01:30:47.860]   Mike Surnovich and his gang who do this stuff for a living.
[01:30:47.860 --> 01:30:51.860]   - Well, that's what happened to James Gunn too, right?
[01:30:51.860 --> 01:30:53.340]   - Right, it is.
[01:30:53.340 --> 01:30:57.580]   And at least in his case, they were able to find things
[01:30:57.580 --> 01:31:01.180]   that were, I mean, they were truly difficult to defend.
[01:31:01.180 --> 01:31:06.020]   I went through and read the Surnovich gangs things
[01:31:06.020 --> 01:31:09.820]   from that they pulled up on Sarah Zhang.
[01:31:09.820 --> 01:31:12.860]   In fact, the day she was announced
[01:31:12.860 --> 01:31:16.940]   as being named to the editorial board of the New York Times,
[01:31:16.940 --> 01:31:21.300]   I tweeted like five minutes after that press release came out.
[01:31:21.300 --> 01:31:24.340]   I said, "Ladies and gentlemen, you watch 24 hours
[01:31:24.340 --> 01:31:26.860]   from now, Mike Surnovich is going to have
[01:31:26.860 --> 01:31:30.820]   an orchestrated attack on Sarah Zhang using her old tweets
[01:31:30.820 --> 01:31:34.940]   'cause I followed her Twitter account for six or eight years.
[01:31:34.940 --> 01:31:38.740]   And I then went, I also went back and looked at a lot
[01:31:38.740 --> 01:31:42.220]   of the things that they were quoting
[01:31:42.220 --> 01:31:47.220]   and they were literally completely out of context.
[01:31:47.220 --> 01:31:48.980]   - Right.
[01:31:48.980 --> 01:31:51.260]   - There's things that I can't say.
[01:31:51.260 --> 01:31:56.060]   There's one NWA song that she loved to quote,
[01:31:56.060 --> 01:32:00.980]   just quote the title of that NWA song
[01:32:00.980 --> 01:32:05.980]   as an ironic shutdown for any discussion
[01:32:05.980 --> 01:32:09.780]   of people in positions of authority.
[01:32:09.780 --> 01:32:13.340]   - You remove that tweet from its context.
[01:32:13.340 --> 01:32:14.700]   It looks bad.
[01:32:14.700 --> 01:32:16.460]   - No, it doesn't look bad.
[01:32:16.460 --> 01:32:19.380]   - Oh, you understand it's an NWA lyric.
[01:32:19.380 --> 01:32:21.940]   - Also, I wanna say that as humans,
[01:32:21.940 --> 01:32:24.260]   we also are doing a much better job.
[01:32:24.260 --> 01:32:28.540]   That one baseball player who is 26 years old had tweets
[01:32:28.540 --> 01:32:31.820]   and he was like 15, 17, saying the N word
[01:32:31.820 --> 01:32:32.660]   and stuff like that.
[01:32:32.660 --> 01:32:34.980]   And he gave a very basic example.
[01:32:34.980 --> 01:32:37.180]   Hey, I grew up in a backwater town.
[01:32:37.180 --> 01:32:38.900]   That's how people talked about things.
[01:32:38.900 --> 01:32:39.980]   Now that I'm in the league
[01:32:39.980 --> 01:32:42.020]   and I've gotten to meet other people,
[01:32:42.020 --> 01:32:43.540]   other cultures, other faiths,
[01:32:43.540 --> 01:32:45.780]   I realized that what I was doing was wrong.
[01:32:45.780 --> 01:32:47.540]   And I can believe his statement of saying,
[01:32:47.540 --> 01:32:50.060]   "Hey, my upbringing had me talking reckless
[01:32:50.060 --> 01:32:51.180]   "and saying stuff like that."
[01:32:51.180 --> 01:32:53.620]   But my professional life and where I've lived now
[01:32:53.620 --> 01:32:55.420]   has had me learn and grow
[01:32:55.420 --> 01:32:57.020]   and my teammates support me in that.
[01:32:57.020 --> 01:32:59.500]   So that a couple of players had that issue
[01:32:59.500 --> 01:33:01.620]   and again, teammates come out and support them.
[01:33:01.620 --> 01:33:03.700]   So depending on what it is.
[01:33:03.700 --> 01:33:05.180]   - It's a good thing.
[01:33:05.180 --> 01:33:07.380]   - Yes, depending on what it is,
[01:33:07.380 --> 01:33:09.340]   people do understand what's going on.
[01:33:09.340 --> 01:33:11.140]   I just can't get behind the gun thing
[01:33:11.140 --> 01:33:13.180]   'cause I don't mess with kids at all.
[01:33:13.180 --> 01:33:14.100]   It's like going to jail,
[01:33:14.100 --> 01:33:15.420]   the things they don't mess with.
[01:33:15.420 --> 01:33:16.540]   You don't mess with nobody's mom,
[01:33:16.540 --> 01:33:17.820]   you don't mess with kids.
[01:33:17.820 --> 01:33:19.300]   - Yeah.
[01:33:19.300 --> 01:33:22.540]   I think I'm just gonna put out a blanket tweet here soon
[01:33:22.540 --> 01:33:23.380]   and say, "You know what?
[01:33:23.380 --> 01:33:25.460]   "I've said some pretty dumb sh--"
[01:33:25.460 --> 01:33:27.300]   - We all have.
[01:33:27.300 --> 01:33:28.740]   Twitter led itself to--
[01:33:28.740 --> 01:33:30.740]   - I'll end it with it, let it go.
[01:33:30.740 --> 01:33:33.180]   - I'm just lucky I could sell the N word anytime I want.
[01:33:33.180 --> 01:33:35.260]   I don't have to worry about them all tweet.
[01:33:35.260 --> 01:33:37.500]   - Nobody here, you're saying none of you
[01:33:37.500 --> 01:33:39.940]   would even consider deleting old tweets.
[01:33:39.940 --> 01:33:41.300]   - No, I'm not deleting anything.
[01:33:41.300 --> 01:33:44.100]   I've said it and I own up to it.
[01:33:44.100 --> 01:33:45.420]   - It probably doesn't work anyway
[01:33:45.420 --> 01:33:47.980]   because you know, people can save 'em
[01:33:47.980 --> 01:33:48.980]   and screenshot 'em and--
[01:33:48.980 --> 01:33:53.980]   - Well, they can, but there is no archive
[01:33:54.660 --> 01:33:57.340]   of Twitter and that's a really interesting thing.
[01:33:57.340 --> 01:33:59.460]   - Library of Congress has the archive.
[01:33:59.460 --> 01:34:00.420]   - No, they don't.
[01:34:00.420 --> 01:34:03.780]   They announced that they were going to do that in 2010
[01:34:03.780 --> 01:34:05.380]   and then it never happened.
[01:34:05.380 --> 01:34:06.220]   - Oh, interesting.
[01:34:06.220 --> 01:34:07.140]   - Oh, what?
[01:34:07.140 --> 01:34:10.020]   So then just let's just delete our tweets every year
[01:34:10.020 --> 01:34:11.460]   and then call it a call to rap.
[01:34:11.460 --> 01:34:13.700]   I can start talking real reckless now.
[01:34:13.700 --> 01:34:16.100]   - There are a fair number of people who do exactly that.
[01:34:16.100 --> 01:34:18.460]   They do it every quarter even.
[01:34:18.460 --> 01:34:20.020]   And if you wanna do that,
[01:34:20.020 --> 01:34:23.020]   if you don't want to have people
[01:34:24.580 --> 01:34:29.580]   just writing, just posting garbage about you,
[01:34:29.580 --> 01:34:31.860]   calling you a hypocrite
[01:34:31.860 --> 01:34:34.020]   because you said something two years ago
[01:34:34.020 --> 01:34:38.660]   and now your attitude has changed on it,
[01:34:38.660 --> 01:34:41.300]   you can avoid that being a thing
[01:34:41.300 --> 01:34:44.140]   if you're famous enough to be the target
[01:34:44.140 --> 01:34:46.700]   of something like that.
[01:34:46.700 --> 01:34:48.940]   But there is no archive right there.
[01:34:48.940 --> 01:34:50.660]   So the only-- - That's interesting.
[01:34:50.660 --> 01:34:52.220]   I did not know that. - The only way that somebody
[01:34:52.220 --> 01:34:56.420]   can find those things is there are random numbers of them
[01:34:56.420 --> 01:34:59.020]   that were screen-capped by people at the time.
[01:34:59.020 --> 01:35:01.220]   So you might be able to find those.
[01:35:01.220 --> 01:35:04.260]   But if you, there is no Twitter archive.
[01:35:04.260 --> 01:35:08.980]   If you delete your tweets, the likelihood is
[01:35:08.980 --> 01:35:10.660]   that most of the things that you said
[01:35:10.660 --> 01:35:12.900]   will never come back to haunt you.
[01:35:12.900 --> 01:35:14.380]   - Somebody on this show once said,
[01:35:14.380 --> 01:35:15.420]   I wish I could remember who it was,
[01:35:15.420 --> 01:35:17.500]   for all I know it's you Owen.
[01:35:17.500 --> 01:35:20.220]   The problem with Twitter is that it's the kind of thing
[01:35:20.220 --> 01:35:22.140]   you'd say around the water cooler
[01:35:22.140 --> 01:35:26.780]   but because it's in print, it's preserved as if it was a essay
[01:35:26.780 --> 01:35:31.260]   and treated as if you thoughtfully crafted that tweet
[01:35:31.260 --> 01:35:33.260]   when it might well just be something you said off,
[01:35:33.260 --> 01:35:35.780]   you were half in the can.
[01:35:35.780 --> 01:35:37.740]   - That's the biggest thing I have on Twitter in general.
[01:35:37.740 --> 01:35:38.820]   - Yeah.
[01:35:38.820 --> 01:35:40.740]   - Yeah and in Twitter, it's just so quick.
[01:35:40.740 --> 01:35:43.060]   You know, how many typos I have when I just tweet things
[01:35:43.060 --> 01:35:44.740]   because I'm just like off the top,
[01:35:44.740 --> 01:35:46.340]   ah yeah, da da da da da.
[01:35:46.340 --> 01:35:48.620]   - I spelled-- - Is it getting worse?
[01:35:48.620 --> 01:35:49.900]   - Oh man, I can't edit that.
[01:35:49.900 --> 01:35:52.940]   - Is it getting worse because the president himself
[01:35:52.940 --> 01:35:56.460]   is willing to use Twitter in that kind of half baked way?
[01:35:56.460 --> 01:36:00.060]   I mean, he tweeted basically a racist tweet yesterday
[01:36:00.060 --> 01:36:01.780]   about LeBron James and Don Leber.
[01:36:01.780 --> 01:36:02.940]   - Are you racist, tweet?
[01:36:02.940 --> 01:36:05.420]   - Hey, many but this was the most recent.
[01:36:05.420 --> 01:36:07.420]   - So let me tell you about that.
[01:36:07.420 --> 01:36:09.300]   That's a perfect example of what I'm saying about
[01:36:09.300 --> 01:36:10.300]   people changing their minds.
[01:36:10.300 --> 01:36:14.900]   So this is a girl, no, this is a guy at a club
[01:36:14.900 --> 01:36:17.060]   talking to a hot girl and she's not responding.
[01:36:17.060 --> 01:36:18.140]   Hey, you're pretty.
[01:36:18.140 --> 01:36:19.180]   Let me buy you a drink.
[01:36:19.180 --> 01:36:20.220]   You wanna hang out?
[01:36:20.220 --> 01:36:21.980]   And she says, no thanks and leaves.
[01:36:21.980 --> 01:36:24.380]   And then you get mad and start writing her number on the wall
[01:36:24.380 --> 01:36:25.540]   and calling her all kinds of names.
[01:36:25.540 --> 01:36:26.380]   - It's like that.
[01:36:26.380 --> 01:36:29.140]   - He tweeted LeBron James, I love his work ethic.
[01:36:29.140 --> 01:36:31.460]   They're down in Miami about to win the championship.
[01:36:31.460 --> 01:36:32.740]   He won the SB Awards.
[01:36:32.740 --> 01:36:34.460]   He's a great man and deserves it.
[01:36:34.460 --> 01:36:38.580]   - LeBron James, he's asked, never responded to him at all.
[01:36:38.580 --> 01:36:40.340]   LeBron says one thing when he asked the question,
[01:36:40.340 --> 01:36:41.660]   he said, look, he's trying to divide us.
[01:36:41.660 --> 01:36:44.020]   And he's like, oh LeBron James is the worst person
[01:36:44.020 --> 01:36:44.860]   in the world.
[01:36:44.860 --> 01:36:46.340]   He never did anything for anybody.
[01:36:46.340 --> 01:36:49.100]   Like you sound like such a scorn lover.
[01:36:49.100 --> 01:36:51.420]   This dude is so weak and pathetic
[01:36:51.420 --> 01:36:53.100]   regardless of your political views.
[01:36:53.100 --> 01:36:54.780]   He's just mentally, by the way.
[01:36:54.780 --> 01:36:57.300]   Because for legal reasons, the one person
[01:36:57.300 --> 01:37:01.180]   who can't delete his tweet history is Donald Trump.
[01:37:01.180 --> 01:37:02.100]   - Oh, that's right.
[01:37:02.100 --> 01:37:03.900]   - It's all public records.
[01:37:03.900 --> 01:37:06.380]   - Yeah, they're presidential so.
[01:37:06.380 --> 01:37:07.220]   - Communication.
[01:37:07.220 --> 01:37:08.300]   - Yeah, it's public records.
[01:37:08.300 --> 01:37:09.180]   - I didn't know that.
[01:37:09.180 --> 01:37:10.020]   - Yeah.
[01:37:10.020 --> 01:37:10.860]   - You know that.
[01:37:10.860 --> 01:37:13.020]   So it's fun when people dig that stuff up, but.
[01:37:13.020 --> 01:37:14.860]   - You can't delete your tweet.
[01:37:14.860 --> 01:37:16.740]   - Yeah, but you can't delete his.
[01:37:16.740 --> 01:37:17.620]   - I just block people.
[01:37:17.620 --> 01:37:20.020]   I say crazy stuff and I'm like, block, ha ha.
[01:37:20.020 --> 01:37:22.580]   Go steal, go deal with the pain and the suffering.
[01:37:22.580 --> 01:37:24.220]   My tweet is not a box you,
[01:37:24.220 --> 01:37:25.700]   no matter what you say back to me.
[01:37:25.700 --> 01:37:26.540]   I can't hear it.
[01:37:26.540 --> 01:37:28.900]   That's usually my thing for trolls when they get out of hand.
[01:37:28.900 --> 01:37:30.380]   - Hey, have you heard?
[01:37:30.380 --> 01:37:31.380]   Go ahead.
[01:37:31.380 --> 01:37:34.460]   - My problem is actually the exact opposite
[01:37:34.460 --> 01:37:38.820]   of what most people have.
[01:37:38.820 --> 01:37:41.340]   When I started on Twitter,
[01:37:41.340 --> 01:37:46.340]   I was very conscious of being a well-known tech journalist
[01:37:46.340 --> 01:37:50.380]   and I wanted to be careful.
[01:37:50.380 --> 01:37:53.420]   I didn't want to be overtly political.
[01:37:53.420 --> 01:37:56.380]   I wanted to avoid using profanity.
[01:37:56.380 --> 01:37:59.620]   Those who follow me now are laughing.
[01:37:59.620 --> 01:38:03.900]   But for the first three or four years,
[01:38:03.900 --> 01:38:06.180]   I was very careful and controlled
[01:38:06.180 --> 01:38:09.220]   and almost, I was almost my own PR shop.
[01:38:09.220 --> 01:38:11.780]   And then at one point,
[01:38:11.780 --> 01:38:14.020]   I think I asked my followers,
[01:38:14.020 --> 01:38:17.300]   they probably had 10,000 followers at that time.
[01:38:17.300 --> 01:38:19.420]   And I said something like,
[01:38:19.420 --> 01:38:23.020]   who out there would be offended
[01:38:23.020 --> 01:38:26.780]   if I dropped an F bomb here?
[01:38:26.780 --> 01:38:29.700]   And one or two people said,
[01:38:29.700 --> 01:38:31.220]   we really prefer that you didn't.
[01:38:31.220 --> 01:38:32.540]   And most people said,
[01:38:32.540 --> 01:38:36.060]   it sounds like you've got a couple of saved up.
[01:38:36.060 --> 01:38:38.300]   (laughing)
[01:38:38.300 --> 01:38:43.300]   - So, I think I'm much more authentic now
[01:38:43.300 --> 01:38:45.660]   and what you see is what you get.
[01:38:45.660 --> 01:38:50.660]   And yet also, I really don't say anything
[01:38:50.660 --> 01:38:56.140]   that I'm not going to feel that I can stand behind
[01:38:56.140 --> 01:38:58.260]   next week, next month, next year.
[01:38:58.260 --> 01:39:00.060]   And if I make a mistake,
[01:39:00.060 --> 01:39:05.060]   if I do something where I have inadvertently wronged somebody
[01:39:05.740 --> 01:39:07.540]   by misquoting them or something,
[01:39:07.540 --> 01:39:10.660]   I'll call myself on it.
[01:39:10.660 --> 01:39:12.540]   I'll correct myself, I'll apologize.
[01:39:12.540 --> 01:39:16.020]   I had an interaction with John Dickerson of CBS News
[01:39:16.020 --> 01:39:18.980]   where I said something snarky about him.
[01:39:18.980 --> 01:39:20.380]   He responded to me,
[01:39:20.380 --> 01:39:22.140]   we had this delightful interaction
[01:39:22.140 --> 01:39:24.420]   and I wound up apologizing to him
[01:39:24.420 --> 01:39:27.180]   for the snarky thing that I said.
[01:39:27.180 --> 01:39:31.020]   And amplifying a couple of the things that he had said
[01:39:31.020 --> 01:39:33.180]   that I thought were worth repeating.
[01:39:33.180 --> 01:39:37.340]   And that's what happens if you're authentic
[01:39:37.340 --> 01:39:40.060]   and you're not trying to play a role
[01:39:40.060 --> 01:39:43.220]   and just be outrageous for outrageousness sake.
[01:39:43.220 --> 01:39:45.300]   - Ed, I will say this to you,
[01:39:45.300 --> 01:39:46.620]   since it's the first time we met
[01:39:46.620 --> 01:39:48.700]   and I'll say it to your face not to be snarky on the internet.
[01:39:48.700 --> 01:39:51.940]   You have the most trolling internet technology name
[01:39:51.940 --> 01:39:52.780]   I've ever seen.
[01:39:52.780 --> 01:39:53.780]   I wouldn't trust anything you said.
[01:39:53.780 --> 01:39:54.620]   (laughing)
[01:39:54.620 --> 01:39:55.900]   It's actually a bot.
[01:39:55.900 --> 01:39:57.780]   You got an ebb bot on your name.
[01:39:57.780 --> 01:39:59.860]   I'm not listening to an ebb bot, gotta say.
[01:39:59.860 --> 01:40:00.700]   Ebb bot got to say.
[01:40:00.700 --> 01:40:02.140]   They're always talking about you, Ed.
[01:40:02.140 --> 01:40:04.340]   - We gotta get these bots off the internet.
[01:40:04.340 --> 01:40:05.180]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:40:05.180 --> 01:40:06.020]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:40:06.020 --> 01:40:06.820]   - They got a bad internet name
[01:40:06.820 --> 01:40:08.580]   and they got you on that one.
[01:40:08.580 --> 01:40:11.620]   - One T, one T makes all the difference, man.
[01:40:11.620 --> 01:40:13.460]   (laughing)
[01:40:13.460 --> 01:40:15.740]   The AI's getting smart and that's all that tells me.
[01:40:15.740 --> 01:40:17.820]   AI, two T's, AI is smart.
[01:40:17.820 --> 01:40:20.420]   - I would check your email from some job offers
[01:40:20.420 --> 01:40:22.580]   from the internet research associate agency.
[01:40:22.580 --> 01:40:24.940]   I think you might have something going there.
[01:40:24.940 --> 01:40:26.820]   We need bots, we need more bots.
[01:40:26.820 --> 01:40:28.780]   Let's get these in the guy, he's a bot.
[01:40:28.780 --> 01:40:30.140]   So Ed, you wrote a good review
[01:40:30.140 --> 01:40:33.540]   of the cutest computer I've ever seen.
[01:40:33.540 --> 01:40:38.100]   And I just got mine on Friday.
[01:40:38.100 --> 01:40:39.420]   It's the Surface Go.
[01:40:39.420 --> 01:40:44.420]   This is tiny, it's a 10 inch Surface Windows machine.
[01:40:44.420 --> 01:40:48.820]   It sells, it's with Windows S, 10 S on it,
[01:40:48.820 --> 01:40:52.860]   but you can instantly turn on Windows 10 Home,
[01:40:52.860 --> 01:40:54.100]   which I did.
[01:40:54.100 --> 01:40:55.940]   - Yeah, that should be the number one thing
[01:40:55.940 --> 01:40:57.780]   that everyone does, good Lord.
[01:40:57.780 --> 01:40:58.780]   It's just--
[01:40:58.780 --> 01:41:00.580]   - Well, unfortunately, you don't even have to reboot it.
[01:41:00.580 --> 01:41:02.980]   You just download something from the store
[01:41:02.980 --> 01:41:05.580]   and all of a sudden you've got Windows 10 Home
[01:41:05.580 --> 01:41:08.780]   and you can now put Chrome on it and other things.
[01:41:08.780 --> 01:41:10.500]   I haven't had it as long as you have,
[01:41:10.500 --> 01:41:15.300]   there are two questions I haven't yet really come down,
[01:41:15.300 --> 01:41:18.860]   coming up with an answer for is battery life and speed.
[01:41:18.860 --> 01:41:21.780]   This is a weird process of Intel, the Pentium Gold.
[01:41:21.780 --> 01:41:23.420]   What do you think?
[01:41:23.420 --> 01:41:28.420]   - So, and I had this discussion with a couple people
[01:41:28.420 --> 01:41:30.940]   on Twitter just last week as a matter of fact.
[01:41:30.940 --> 01:41:33.420]   - Well, how about that?
[01:41:33.420 --> 01:41:34.860]   - Imagine that.
[01:41:34.860 --> 01:41:39.220]   If you understand the purpose of this device,
[01:41:39.220 --> 01:41:42.820]   this is a general purpose productivity
[01:41:42.820 --> 01:41:47.780]   and casual entertainment device,
[01:41:47.780 --> 01:41:49.740]   which is the way that I used it
[01:41:49.740 --> 01:41:51.340]   and the way that I evaluated it.
[01:41:51.340 --> 01:41:55.860]   So, running Office 365 apps, no problem.
[01:41:55.860 --> 01:41:58.580]   Fast, zippy, spices.
[01:41:58.580 --> 01:42:00.580]   - Actually, because it's the size of the screen,
[01:42:00.580 --> 01:42:04.500]   is it using the touch first office?
[01:42:04.500 --> 01:42:06.300]   Is it using the tablet version?
[01:42:06.300 --> 01:42:07.260]   - Oh, no, no, no, no.
[01:42:07.260 --> 01:42:08.740]   No, this is a full PC.
[01:42:08.740 --> 01:42:09.580]   - Okay.
[01:42:09.580 --> 01:42:11.540]   - This is an honest to God,
[01:42:11.540 --> 01:42:15.180]   real copy of Windows running a 64-bit Windows.
[01:42:15.180 --> 01:42:16.020]   - But if you didn't--
[01:42:16.020 --> 01:42:18.740]   - So, you and I both have Office 365 subscriptions.
[01:42:18.740 --> 01:42:21.260]   It recognized mine and immediately loaded Office.
[01:42:21.260 --> 01:42:23.340]   But if we didn't, would I be using
[01:42:23.340 --> 01:42:26.460]   the free version of Office on there?
[01:42:26.460 --> 01:42:28.460]   - Well, you wouldn't have any version of Office.
[01:42:28.460 --> 01:42:29.780]   - Not at all, okay.
[01:42:29.780 --> 01:42:31.780]   - Because I remember Microsoft said
[01:42:31.780 --> 01:42:34.540]   if it's a screen size 10 inches or under--
[01:42:34.540 --> 01:42:39.020]   - Yeah, yeah, those were, you know, for tablets,
[01:42:39.020 --> 01:42:42.740]   you can't, it's almost impossible to actually find those apps
[01:42:42.740 --> 01:42:46.580]   in the store if you're on something that it thinks is a PC.
[01:42:46.580 --> 01:42:47.420]   - Okay.
[01:42:47.420 --> 01:42:49.180]   - I also noted it's not in tablet mode
[01:42:49.180 --> 01:42:50.660]   and even if you detach the keyboard,
[01:42:50.660 --> 01:42:51.980]   it stays in desktop mode
[01:42:51.980 --> 01:42:54.180]   unless you explicitly put it in tablet mode.
[01:42:54.180 --> 01:42:56.060]   They're treating this like a computer.
[01:42:56.060 --> 01:42:58.540]   - It is a computer.
[01:42:58.540 --> 01:43:00.820]   And so what's interesting about it,
[01:43:00.820 --> 01:43:04.340]   well, just the other thing about the performance of it.
[01:43:04.340 --> 01:43:08.020]   If you try to play Fortnite on it,
[01:43:08.020 --> 01:43:13.020]   or whatever, you know, some game that demands a high frame rate,
[01:43:13.020 --> 01:43:16.460]   you're going to be very disappointed.
[01:43:16.460 --> 01:43:19.100]   - You know what you need an eGPU?
[01:43:19.100 --> 01:43:21.860]   - That's right.
[01:43:21.860 --> 01:43:24.700]   - It weighs 10 times more than the computer.
[01:43:24.700 --> 01:43:26.940]   (laughing)
[01:43:26.940 --> 01:43:27.900]   That computer's so light,
[01:43:27.900 --> 01:43:29.780]   it might even make it worth it traveling around with it
[01:43:29.780 --> 01:43:31.620]   unlike your MacBook Pro.
[01:43:31.620 --> 01:43:34.820]   - If you try to run Photoshop on it,
[01:43:34.820 --> 01:43:35.660]   - Yeah, it'd be a bit--
[01:43:35.660 --> 01:43:40.660]   - You know, it'll work, you'll be able to get it done.
[01:43:40.660 --> 01:43:44.740]   But you couldn't, you'll be able to do things
[01:43:44.740 --> 01:43:46.380]   that you couldn't do on an iPad.
[01:43:46.380 --> 01:43:50.780]   And that to me is ultimately the pitch for this device.
[01:43:50.780 --> 01:43:53.500]   - This is an iPad, but it's running over desktop operating,
[01:43:53.500 --> 01:43:54.780]   a real operating system.
[01:43:54.780 --> 01:43:55.620]   - Right, it is it.
[01:43:55.620 --> 01:43:57.980]   When I set this up on my desk,
[01:43:57.980 --> 01:44:00.340]   and then I put an iPad alongside of it
[01:44:00.340 --> 01:44:02.540]   with one of those Logitech keyboards on it,
[01:44:02.540 --> 01:44:04.620]   they're almost exactly the same size.
[01:44:04.620 --> 01:44:06.900]   The aspect ratios are a little bit different.
[01:44:06.900 --> 01:44:11.900]   So this is a device for the person who has been saying,
[01:44:11.900 --> 01:44:15.780]   my laptop is too heavy to drag around with me.
[01:44:15.780 --> 01:44:17.820]   It's three or four pounds.
[01:44:17.820 --> 01:44:20.940]   It hurts when I carry it through the airport,
[01:44:20.940 --> 01:44:22.580]   I just don't wanna have that with me.
[01:44:22.580 --> 01:44:25.340]   And so they're bringing the little external keyboard
[01:44:25.340 --> 01:44:30.340]   for the iPad and they're doing whatever their work is on that.
[01:44:30.340 --> 01:44:33.380]   This is the same thing,
[01:44:33.380 --> 01:44:36.380]   except it does full PC workloads.
[01:44:36.380 --> 01:44:37.740]   And what does--
[01:44:37.740 --> 01:44:40.540]   - Does this necessarily just step up from Chromebook?
[01:44:40.540 --> 01:44:45.540]   - Yeah, in a way, I mean, to me what's fascinating about this
[01:44:47.740 --> 01:44:50.620]   is I've got, I have a messenger bag
[01:44:50.620 --> 01:44:52.580]   that I normally would use
[01:44:52.580 --> 01:44:55.780]   if I'm going to a trade show in Europe next month.
[01:44:55.780 --> 01:44:58.460]   And normally I would carry a messenger bag
[01:44:58.460 --> 01:45:01.940]   with a three pound notebook in it,
[01:45:01.940 --> 01:45:03.820]   and then a bunch and the charger
[01:45:03.820 --> 01:45:06.100]   and a bunch of other stuff that goes with that.
[01:45:06.100 --> 01:45:09.740]   And by the end of the day, my shoulder hurts.
[01:45:09.740 --> 01:45:14.740]   I have a small, a small bag, your basic man bag.
[01:45:15.460 --> 01:45:18.540]   This thing actually fits in that.
[01:45:18.540 --> 01:45:20.900]   And I can carry this to the show with me.
[01:45:20.900 --> 01:45:22.780]   And in fact, I can snap the keyboard off
[01:45:22.780 --> 01:45:25.900]   and use the pen with it and take handwritten notes
[01:45:25.900 --> 01:45:30.140]   in one note when I'm at a press conference or something,
[01:45:30.140 --> 01:45:33.740]   which is something that I couldn't do before.
[01:45:33.740 --> 01:45:37.580]   I could do that with an iPad with the Magic Pencil,
[01:45:37.580 --> 01:45:40.260]   but then if I go back,
[01:45:40.260 --> 01:45:44.940]   our CMS at ZDNet isn't exactly friendly
[01:45:44.940 --> 01:45:49.100]   to an iPad, you need to have a Mac or a PC
[01:45:49.100 --> 01:45:52.300]   to really take advantage of all the features.
[01:45:52.300 --> 01:45:56.340]   And so this is actually that one device that I could carry
[01:45:56.340 --> 01:45:58.540]   that would, it'll be a tablet,
[01:45:58.540 --> 01:46:02.380]   I can download Netflix movies onto it,
[01:46:02.380 --> 01:46:05.540]   it runs Spotify and it runs iTunes,
[01:46:05.540 --> 01:46:08.020]   but it also runs the full office 365
[01:46:08.020 --> 01:46:09.660]   and it has a full web browser in it.
[01:46:09.660 --> 01:46:13.460]   I can run Google Chrome, Firebox, Microsoft Edge,
[01:46:13.460 --> 01:46:14.300]   whatever you want.
[01:46:14.300 --> 01:46:16.980]   If you turn off S, the S mode obviously.
[01:46:16.980 --> 01:46:20.980]   All of those things, yeah, which I say everyone should do.
[01:46:20.980 --> 01:46:21.900]   There's no reason not to.
[01:46:21.900 --> 01:46:24.100]   Is there any reason not to?
[01:46:24.100 --> 01:46:26.340]   Yeah, if I were giving this to
[01:46:26.340 --> 01:46:31.060]   an extremely non-technical relative,
[01:46:31.060 --> 01:46:32.580]   who has a history getting--
[01:46:32.580 --> 01:46:34.300]   I'm downloading crap.
[01:46:34.300 --> 01:46:35.620]   Yeah.
[01:46:35.620 --> 01:46:38.980]   Of having me have to come over and clean up their machine
[01:46:38.980 --> 01:46:41.980]   because for whatever reason they got infected with something,
[01:46:41.980 --> 01:46:43.220]   then yes, I would--
[01:46:43.220 --> 01:46:45.420]   Because the S mode means you can only install apps
[01:46:45.420 --> 01:46:47.500]   from the Microsoft store,
[01:46:47.500 --> 01:46:49.380]   which keeps you safe 'cause you're not downloading
[01:46:49.380 --> 01:46:50.700]   weird crappy stuff.
[01:46:50.700 --> 01:46:55.420]   Yeah, and you can download now iTunes and Spotify
[01:46:55.420 --> 01:46:57.220]   and Slack and a few other things.
[01:46:57.220 --> 01:46:58.060]   Those are all--
[01:46:58.060 --> 01:47:01.100]   Those are all available from the store.
[01:47:01.100 --> 01:47:03.300]   Chrome is the big one that's not.
[01:47:03.300 --> 01:47:05.940]   It's not and it never will be.
[01:47:05.940 --> 01:47:06.780]   Right, right.
[01:47:06.780 --> 01:47:07.620]   And that's--
[01:47:07.620 --> 01:47:08.620]   What's battery life for you?
[01:47:08.620 --> 01:47:10.220]   I haven't had it long enough to know.
[01:47:11.620 --> 01:47:16.420]   For normal productivity use, five to seven hours.
[01:47:16.420 --> 01:47:17.580]   That's fine.
[01:47:17.580 --> 01:47:21.740]   And for watching videos,
[01:47:21.740 --> 01:47:25.740]   like on a transatlantic plane flight,
[01:47:25.740 --> 01:47:26.980]   seven to eight hours.
[01:47:26.980 --> 01:47:28.180]   That's good.
[01:47:28.180 --> 01:47:31.580]   And of course, in most planes these days,
[01:47:31.580 --> 01:47:33.500]   you've got a--
[01:47:33.500 --> 01:47:34.860]   There's a plug there.
[01:47:34.860 --> 01:47:36.900]   You can recharge.
[01:47:36.900 --> 01:47:38.820]   That does charge to the Type-C port,
[01:47:38.820 --> 01:47:41.660]   which is for the first surface that doesn't require
[01:47:41.660 --> 01:47:45.100]   that goofy surface charging connector.
[01:47:45.100 --> 01:47:48.180]   It's the second, the Surface Book II,
[01:47:48.180 --> 01:47:51.980]   also that it has the Surface Connect.
[01:47:51.980 --> 01:47:53.260]   It does.
[01:47:53.260 --> 01:47:56.500]   Yes, and the charger, we see if I have--
[01:47:56.500 --> 01:47:57.780]   It's nice, it's light.
[01:47:57.780 --> 01:47:59.620]   I don't know why you use it because you have--
[01:47:59.620 --> 01:48:01.180]   Everybody, I have Type-C everywhere.
[01:48:01.180 --> 01:48:02.940]   Why don't what do I need that for?
[01:48:02.940 --> 01:48:06.020]   Oh, you know what they--
[01:48:06.020 --> 01:48:09.020]   It bothers me because it looks just like an SD car slide.
[01:48:09.020 --> 01:48:10.540]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:48:10.540 --> 01:48:12.820]   So it's a little disappointing.
[01:48:12.820 --> 01:48:14.620]   So Scoot's got two ways to charge it.
[01:48:14.620 --> 01:48:15.460]   OK.
[01:48:15.460 --> 01:48:18.700]   So the other-- well, and also the Type-C dock--
[01:48:18.700 --> 01:48:20.740]   and I've used it for a docking station.
[01:48:20.740 --> 01:48:24.140]   So you can do external monitor--
[01:48:24.140 --> 01:48:26.860]   I have the Surface Dock, which does use that Surface Connector
[01:48:26.860 --> 01:48:28.620]   so that is one reason why you want to use it.
[01:48:28.620 --> 01:48:30.140]   But you can use like--
[01:48:30.140 --> 01:48:31.300]   Type-C dock.
[01:48:31.300 --> 01:48:35.300]   $50, $50 Type-C dock so you get it Amazon for that.
[01:48:35.300 --> 01:48:41.620]   Now, the one-- there's two variations of the Surface Go.
[01:48:41.620 --> 01:48:44.460]   And I have the more expensive one.
[01:48:44.460 --> 01:48:45.220]   That's why.
[01:48:45.220 --> 01:48:48.300]   Yeah, because I wasn't going to get 64 gigs of storage.
[01:48:48.300 --> 01:48:52.260]   And 4 gigs of RAM is not as a non-starter.
[01:48:52.260 --> 01:48:54.100]   And it's not just-- well, I think for some people,
[01:48:54.100 --> 01:48:57.860]   it would be it's 64 gigs of EMMC storage
[01:48:57.860 --> 01:49:00.900]   as opposed to an SSD.
[01:49:00.900 --> 01:49:03.620]   So that one's going to be slow.
[01:49:03.620 --> 01:49:05.820]   But again, for somebody--
[01:49:05.820 --> 01:49:09.100]   I would see this-- and I wrote the headline on the articles,
[01:49:09.100 --> 01:49:10.420]   the best cheap PC ever.
[01:49:10.420 --> 01:49:14.540]   And we could have a debate over that.
[01:49:14.540 --> 01:49:17.860]   But I would argue that this is an excellent replacement
[01:49:17.860 --> 01:49:23.260]   for somebody who has this seven or eight-year-old PC
[01:49:23.260 --> 01:49:26.860]   that originally came with Windows Vista
[01:49:26.860 --> 01:49:30.220]   and is just dog-slow.
[01:49:30.220 --> 01:49:35.340]   But they keep it in the den because that's how--
[01:49:35.340 --> 01:49:38.420]   you have to occasionally do something on a PC.
[01:49:38.420 --> 01:49:40.340]   And I would say this is a great replacement
[01:49:40.340 --> 01:49:45.420]   for something like that, even the low spec version that's
[01:49:45.420 --> 01:49:51.540]   $4.99, even though we, as tech experts,
[01:49:51.540 --> 01:49:57.020]   would be horrified at having to wait an extra half a second
[01:49:57.020 --> 01:49:59.700]   for a program to load.
[01:49:59.700 --> 01:50:03.860]   Somebody whose experience is with a seven or eight-year-old PC,
[01:50:03.860 --> 01:50:06.380]   it will be a major upgrade for them.
[01:50:06.380 --> 01:50:07.420]   Yeah.
[01:50:07.420 --> 01:50:10.500]   There's not going to be a good device for writers in general
[01:50:10.500 --> 01:50:13.300]   that people that are on the go writers,
[01:50:13.300 --> 01:50:15.580]   because you don't have to have a lot of horsepower
[01:50:15.580 --> 01:50:18.300]   to run a text editor, if you will.
[01:50:18.300 --> 01:50:20.900]   The drawback is it's a tiny screen and a tiny keyboard.
[01:50:20.900 --> 01:50:24.460]   Ed, were you able to write extensive passages with it?
[01:50:24.460 --> 01:50:29.780]   Yeah, now it helps that I'm a--
[01:50:29.780 --> 01:50:31.580]   You're actually 4'3.
[01:50:31.580 --> 01:50:36.460]   If made to speak in every saw me type--
[01:50:36.460 --> 01:50:37.940]   Hunt and Pekker, huh?
[01:50:37.940 --> 01:50:40.260]   Oh, man.
[01:50:40.260 --> 01:50:43.100]   I'm an old school sports writer type.
[01:50:43.100 --> 01:50:44.940]   I use all 10 fingers.
[01:50:44.940 --> 01:50:50.500]   But it's an unorthodox style.
[01:50:50.500 --> 01:50:56.460]   I do know Microsoft claims that they did a lot of testing
[01:50:56.460 --> 01:50:58.220]   in their labs with people on this.
[01:50:58.220 --> 01:51:01.820]   And they say that a good touch-type is within about a week
[01:51:01.820 --> 01:51:06.060]   can get to about 97% of their normal rate.
[01:51:06.060 --> 01:51:11.580]   And I didn't find it difficult.
[01:51:11.580 --> 01:51:12.580]   I didn't find it anymore.
[01:51:12.580 --> 01:51:16.380]   It's exactly the same size as one of those iPad keyboards.
[01:51:16.380 --> 01:51:18.220]   So if you can get used to one of those,
[01:51:18.220 --> 01:51:19.220]   you could get used to this.
[01:51:19.220 --> 01:51:20.540]   That's who this is aimed at.
[01:51:20.540 --> 01:51:22.020]   This is a-- this is--
[01:51:22.020 --> 01:51:23.020]   It's a pen and screen.
[01:51:23.020 --> 01:51:23.900]   That's a good size.
[01:51:23.900 --> 01:51:24.740]   It's the same size.
[01:51:24.740 --> 01:51:25.580]   No accessibility.
[01:51:25.580 --> 01:51:27.860]   Same price.
[01:51:27.860 --> 01:51:29.900]   Yeah, I mean, it's clearly aimed at that group.
[01:51:29.900 --> 01:51:31.700]   Although, yeah, I kind of--
[01:51:31.700 --> 01:51:33.860]   The other thing is it's dang cute.
[01:51:33.860 --> 01:51:37.260]   And I got the-- it looks like you got the burgundy cover, too.
[01:51:37.260 --> 01:51:39.020]   I got the burgundy pen, the burgundy cover.
[01:51:39.020 --> 01:51:40.780]   And I even bought the burgundy mouse, which
[01:51:40.780 --> 01:51:43.220]   is completely superfluous because it actually
[01:51:43.220 --> 01:51:46.140]   has a pretty good trackpad.
[01:51:46.140 --> 01:51:48.580]   Yeah, it's nice to have a--
[01:51:48.580 --> 01:51:49.740]   I find it nice to have a mouse.
[01:51:49.740 --> 01:51:52.940]   I actually-- that's just a stock photo on the image there.
[01:51:52.940 --> 01:51:55.900]   I have the platinum cover and the platinum--
[01:51:55.900 --> 01:51:56.900]   Nice.
[01:51:56.900 --> 01:51:58.060]   --the platinum mouse.
[01:51:58.060 --> 01:52:00.020]   But yeah, it's very cute.
[01:52:00.020 --> 01:52:05.300]   It has the same build quality as the other surface units.
[01:52:05.300 --> 01:52:12.300]   And so it has this really great solid, well-built feel to it.
[01:52:12.300 --> 01:52:16.220]   And that's-- that-- and I hope that one of the things
[01:52:16.220 --> 01:52:21.740]   that this does is that it takes the PC OEMs who
[01:52:21.740 --> 01:52:29.340]   have been cranking out really mediocre $499 and $399 PCs.
[01:52:29.340 --> 01:52:31.500]   And it helps them up their game.
[01:52:31.500 --> 01:52:33.860]   I think that the original surface,
[01:52:33.860 --> 01:52:36.380]   that that's kind of what it did.
[01:52:36.380 --> 01:52:40.780]   And you watched Lenovo, you watched HP, you watched Dell.
[01:52:40.780 --> 01:52:45.500]   You compare-- look at their PCs from 2012
[01:52:45.500 --> 01:52:47.060]   when the first surface came out.
[01:52:47.060 --> 01:52:50.420]   And then 2015, when the first good surface came out,
[01:52:50.420 --> 01:52:51.940]   the Surface Pro 3.
[01:52:51.940 --> 01:52:55.340]   And you look at the evolution of the PC market since then.
[01:52:55.340 --> 01:53:02.780]   And I think they have improved dramatically just--
[01:53:02.780 --> 01:53:06.620]   in many cases, with some of the manufacturers,
[01:53:06.620 --> 01:53:11.420]   just by copying features that Microsoft came out with
[01:53:11.420 --> 01:53:13.660]   on the surface.
[01:53:13.660 --> 01:53:16.540]   I have to say that is one thing that you really notice
[01:53:16.540 --> 01:53:17.940]   when you're faced--
[01:53:17.940 --> 01:53:19.900]   and I still prefer Mac OS.
[01:53:19.900 --> 01:53:21.940]   But when you're faced with the very limited choice
[01:53:21.940 --> 01:53:27.100]   you get in the Apple world and the amazing heterogeneity
[01:53:27.100 --> 01:53:29.660]   of the PC world, you really-- there's
[01:53:29.660 --> 01:53:33.900]   nothing you can't get in some form of fashion running Windows.
[01:53:33.900 --> 01:53:35.180]   Heterogeneity.
[01:53:35.180 --> 01:53:36.900]   Heterogeneity.
[01:53:36.900 --> 01:53:39.460]   Sounds like a spark I like you could help me get a mortgage
[01:53:39.460 --> 01:53:40.060]   from my house.
[01:53:40.060 --> 01:53:43.540]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:53:43.540 --> 01:53:44.540]   That's what I'm thinking.
[01:53:44.540 --> 01:53:46.100]   Oh, doctor.
[01:53:46.100 --> 01:53:46.860]   Smart.
[01:53:46.860 --> 01:53:48.540]   Why do I like you with that vocab?
[01:53:48.540 --> 01:53:49.940]   I just happened.
[01:53:49.940 --> 01:53:54.260]   I'm just happy to be holding my hands the exact thing.
[01:53:54.260 --> 01:53:55.620]   You need, my friend.
[01:53:55.620 --> 01:53:56.180]   I didn't--
[01:53:56.180 --> 01:53:57.900]   Somebody somebody you can help me.
[01:53:57.900 --> 01:53:59.900]   This is a skill.
[01:53:59.900 --> 01:54:01.300]   Sales is a skill.
[01:54:01.300 --> 01:54:03.220]   I'm on the lower end of it now.
[01:54:03.220 --> 01:54:05.740]   Can't pass the popcorn, please.
[01:54:05.740 --> 01:54:07.220]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:54:07.220 --> 01:54:09.140]   It's time to talk about rocket mortgage
[01:54:09.140 --> 01:54:11.420]   from quick and loans, the best, the biggest lender
[01:54:11.420 --> 01:54:15.780]   in the country, and a very customer-centric business.
[01:54:15.780 --> 01:54:17.900]   I mean, that's one of the things I love about quick and loans.
[01:54:17.900 --> 01:54:19.940]   And we've talked before about rocket mortgage,
[01:54:19.940 --> 01:54:22.780]   which is their entirely online mortgage approval process.
[01:54:22.780 --> 01:54:24.540]   Let me go in a little bit more detail
[01:54:24.540 --> 01:54:27.300]   about why rocket mortgage is more than just an easy way
[01:54:27.300 --> 01:54:28.420]   to apply for a loan.
[01:54:28.420 --> 01:54:32.300]   It's the best way to apply for a new home loan.
[01:54:32.300 --> 01:54:34.460]   Interest rates are starting to go up, aren't they?
[01:54:34.460 --> 01:54:36.180]   That adds a lot of anxiety.
[01:54:36.180 --> 01:54:38.220]   And the last thing you want when you're buying the most
[01:54:38.220 --> 01:54:40.980]   expensive thing you'll ever buy, even more
[01:54:40.980 --> 01:54:44.500]   expensive than an I9 MacBook Pro and an eGPU,
[01:54:44.500 --> 01:54:48.780]   you need to get the sense that, OK, I can take my--
[01:54:48.780 --> 01:54:52.180]   I need the zen of being able to take my time
[01:54:52.180 --> 01:54:54.940]   and choosing the right house, not being rushed into it.
[01:54:54.940 --> 01:54:57.020]   That's what rocket mortgages bring me,
[01:54:57.020 --> 01:55:00.420]   with something they call the power buying process.
[01:55:00.420 --> 01:55:02.860]   It starts, as always with rocket mortgage,
[01:55:02.860 --> 01:55:05.900]   with this really simple to use rocket mortgage website.
[01:55:05.900 --> 01:55:09.060]   It's rocketmortgage.com/twit2.
[01:55:09.060 --> 01:55:12.820]   Those few simple questions, they get everything they need.
[01:55:12.820 --> 01:55:15.420]   They have all the relationships with the financial institutions.
[01:55:15.420 --> 01:55:16.820]   So once you give them permission,
[01:55:16.820 --> 01:55:18.460]   they can go out and get the information they need.
[01:55:18.460 --> 01:55:21.540]   And then based on income assets and credit,
[01:55:21.540 --> 01:55:23.100]   they will quickly give you approval.
[01:55:23.100 --> 01:55:25.020]   But within 24 hours, they'll give you something
[01:55:25.020 --> 01:55:26.580]   called verified approval.
[01:55:26.580 --> 01:55:28.700]   So you get the pre-qualified approval right away.
[01:55:28.700 --> 01:55:30.780]   Within about 10 minutes, eight minutes,
[01:55:30.780 --> 01:55:32.700]   the verified approval, within a day,
[01:55:32.700 --> 01:55:35.180]   that gives you the strength of a cash buyer.
[01:55:35.180 --> 01:55:40.740]   It's basically saying, we are going to give this person that loan.
[01:55:40.740 --> 01:55:42.460]   So when you go in and buy a house,
[01:55:42.460 --> 01:55:44.540]   the seller looks at you like a cash buyer.
[01:55:44.540 --> 01:55:46.740]   There's no contingency on getting the loan.
[01:55:46.740 --> 01:55:48.140]   You got the loan.
[01:55:48.140 --> 01:55:49.420]   That's fabulous.
[01:55:49.420 --> 01:55:50.420]   Then the next thing happens.
[01:55:50.420 --> 01:55:52.220]   It really eliminates the anxiety.
[01:55:52.220 --> 01:55:53.780]   You get the rate shield approval.
[01:55:53.780 --> 01:55:56.700]   This is a guaranteed rate for up to 90 days.
[01:55:56.700 --> 01:55:58.820]   That means you have time to look at all the houses.
[01:55:58.820 --> 01:56:02.060]   You have time to breathe and find the right place,
[01:56:02.060 --> 01:56:03.700]   not be rushed into it.
[01:56:03.700 --> 01:56:06.540]   If your rate is locked in, if rates go up,
[01:56:06.540 --> 01:56:08.140]   your rate does not move.
[01:56:08.140 --> 01:56:11.740]   If rates go down, though, by the way, your rate will drop.
[01:56:11.740 --> 01:56:13.180]   So you win either way.
[01:56:13.180 --> 01:56:16.020]   You just kind of have peace of mind there.
[01:56:16.020 --> 01:56:17.500]   This is exactly what you'd expect
[01:56:17.500 --> 01:56:19.060]   from America's Best Mortgage lender,
[01:56:19.060 --> 01:56:22.900]   rocketmortgage.com/twit2 from quick and loans.

[01:56:32.020 --> 01:56:34.740]   and the zen of knowing you're not in a rush.
[01:56:34.740 --> 01:56:37.660]   You got quick and loans backing you up.
[01:56:37.660 --> 01:56:38.940]   Rate shield approval only valid

[01:56:51.020 --> 01:56:51.860]   You don't have to remember all that.
[01:56:51.860 --> 01:56:56.860]   Just remember this, rocketmortgage.com/twit2.
[01:56:56.860 --> 01:57:00.820]   We thank, uh, quick and loans.
[01:57:00.820 --> 01:57:02.620]   They've been a big supporter of this network.
[01:57:02.620 --> 01:57:04.060]   We appreciate it.
[01:57:04.060 --> 01:57:04.900]   The best.
[01:57:04.900 --> 01:57:06.100]   I knew you were the right man for the job.
[01:57:06.100 --> 01:57:09.300]   The right man to get you into,
[01:57:09.300 --> 01:57:12.340]   what's it gonna take to get you into a new home,
[01:57:12.340 --> 01:57:14.420]   O and J.J. Stone?
[01:57:14.420 --> 01:57:17.740]   You to liquefied 22% of your old gadgets
[01:57:17.740 --> 01:57:20.780]   so I could sell them with you at a high rate
[01:57:20.780 --> 01:57:22.620]   so that I could put my down payment
[01:57:22.620 --> 01:57:26.140]   to rakmortgage.com to get the lowest rates available.
[01:57:26.140 --> 01:57:27.620]   You know, like I said, we're gonna negotiate
[01:57:27.620 --> 01:57:28.580]   these terms, Uncle Leo.
[01:57:28.580 --> 01:57:29.860]   We're gonna get this done.
[01:57:29.860 --> 01:57:31.020]   I made two mistakes.
[01:57:31.020 --> 01:57:33.020]   I shouldn't have shorted Tesla.
[01:57:33.020 --> 01:57:33.860]   Oh, I love it.
[01:57:33.860 --> 01:57:36.900]   The shorts have lost now with more than $2 billion.
[01:57:36.900 --> 01:57:38.180]   Lost their shorts.
[01:57:38.180 --> 01:57:41.900]   They've lost their shorts and I invested in movie pass.
[01:57:41.900 --> 01:57:43.140]   Maybe that was a mistake.
[01:57:43.140 --> 01:57:43.980]   I don't know.
[01:57:43.980 --> 01:57:44.820]   Yipe.
[01:57:44.820 --> 01:57:46.020]   (laughs)
[01:57:46.020 --> 01:57:48.540]   Did any of you use movie pass?
[01:57:48.540 --> 01:57:50.660]   So, uh, yeah.
[01:57:50.660 --> 01:57:51.940]   I just thought it's too good to be true.
[01:57:51.940 --> 01:57:52.780]   I'm not gonna do it.
[01:57:52.780 --> 01:57:53.620]   What about you, Owen?
[01:57:53.620 --> 01:57:54.460]   Okay, so.
[01:57:54.460 --> 01:57:55.300]   It was sweet.
[01:57:55.300 --> 01:57:56.140]   It was pretty funny.
[01:57:56.140 --> 01:57:58.780]   Everybody who follows me on the internet
[01:57:58.780 --> 01:58:03.140]   knows that I am the person that destroyed movie pass.
[01:58:03.140 --> 01:58:03.980]   As soon as they said--
[01:58:03.980 --> 01:58:04.820]   You broke it.
[01:58:04.820 --> 01:58:05.660]   You were giving out.
[01:58:05.660 --> 01:58:09.100]   As soon as they said, it was $9.99 a month.
[01:58:09.100 --> 01:58:10.380]   I got one for me.
[01:58:10.380 --> 01:58:12.540]   Leah got her first credit card with her name on it.
[01:58:12.540 --> 01:58:13.940]   I got one for Leah.
[01:58:13.940 --> 01:58:15.500]   I paid $20 a month.
[01:58:15.500 --> 01:58:19.940]   Last year alone, I saw 73 movies times two.
[01:58:19.940 --> 01:58:20.780]   Oh my God.
[01:58:20.780 --> 01:58:23.300]   That averaged out to me paying,
[01:58:23.300 --> 01:58:27.340]   that averaged out to them paying for 79% of the movie.
[01:58:27.340 --> 01:58:30.620]   Like they made a $1.66 per movie off of me
[01:58:30.620 --> 01:58:32.620]   when the movies are $14 a pop.
[01:58:32.620 --> 01:58:34.300]   That's how many movies I saw.
[01:58:34.300 --> 01:58:37.540]   This year, I'm on record for 54 movies times two.
[01:58:37.540 --> 01:58:40.020]   Let me tell you how bad I am with these movies.
[01:58:40.020 --> 01:58:43.540]   I went to go see like a Jesus movie, a possible movie.
[01:58:43.540 --> 01:58:44.940]   I fell asleep and it didn't care.
[01:58:44.940 --> 01:58:45.740]   They lose no money cost.
[01:58:45.740 --> 01:58:47.220]   Did you see that?
[01:58:47.220 --> 01:58:51.140]   I went and saw the Godi movie, which is the 57th Godi movie.
[01:58:51.140 --> 01:58:51.980]   It was horrible.
[01:58:51.980 --> 01:58:54.340]   I walked out, didn't give a hoo and or Annie.
[01:58:54.340 --> 01:58:56.260]   I'm seeing three four movies a week.
[01:58:56.260 --> 01:58:58.900]   I personally, me and my daughter have destroyed
[01:58:58.900 --> 01:59:00.860]   and decimated movie paths.
[01:59:00.860 --> 01:59:03.660]   It's just people like us that has made this company go bankrupt.
[01:59:03.660 --> 01:59:06.700]   I'm super kind of sad, but I got a backup plan.
[01:59:06.700 --> 01:59:09.020]   It's just amazing how dumb they were to think
[01:59:09.020 --> 01:59:09.980]   that this was going to work.
[01:59:09.980 --> 01:59:11.260]   I don't know what the plan was.
[01:59:11.260 --> 01:59:14.700]   I was expecting them to raise the rate after three months.
[01:59:14.700 --> 01:59:16.100]   They did not.
[01:59:16.100 --> 01:59:18.100]   And I expect that after six months, they did not.
[01:59:18.100 --> 01:59:20.580]   Then they did the year of front membership
[01:59:20.580 --> 01:59:21.660]   because I was doing month to month.
[01:59:21.660 --> 01:59:24.380]   They wanted people to pay one 20 a year
[01:59:24.380 --> 01:59:27.220]   and that gets more cash influx, which floated me
[01:59:27.220 --> 01:59:28.500]   through Christmas.
[01:59:28.500 --> 01:59:30.860]   And now they're just like, what do you do it?
[01:59:30.860 --> 01:59:34.580]   You AMC charges $20 a month and puts a limit on three movies
[01:59:34.580 --> 01:59:34.940]   per week.
[01:59:34.940 --> 01:59:37.660]   He didn't have to have a no doctor.
[01:59:37.660 --> 01:59:40.500]   I was watching movies on time, Friday night.
[01:59:40.500 --> 01:59:44.060]   I'm just a big customer with my daughter fall asleep.
[01:59:44.060 --> 01:59:48.580]   So they ran out of cash last Friday and went offline.
[01:59:48.580 --> 01:59:49.260]   What did you do?
[01:59:49.260 --> 01:59:51.260]   Did you run out and get the other one cinema
[01:59:51.260 --> 01:59:52.700]   or there's others, right?
[01:59:52.700 --> 01:59:56.820]   So I live in a nine.
[01:59:56.820 --> 01:59:58.820]   I don't live in a high rate of populace.
[01:59:58.820 --> 02:00:00.900]   So a lot of my movies were grayed out,
[02:00:00.900 --> 02:00:01.820]   but I could still see some.
[02:00:01.820 --> 02:00:05.860]   And now I can only see each movie at one time during the day.
[02:00:05.860 --> 02:00:06.700]   So I guess they're going to be.
[02:00:06.700 --> 02:00:10.620]   We're going to see the price 50% they said.
[02:00:10.620 --> 02:00:12.940]   Yeah, I'll pay 20 bucks.
[02:00:12.940 --> 02:00:13.740]   Like I said, I don't mind.
[02:00:13.740 --> 02:00:15.860]   I've been stealing hand over fist.
[02:00:15.860 --> 02:00:18.940]   I feel like I owe a movie back.
[02:00:18.940 --> 02:00:20.700]   You still ran him into the brand.
[02:00:20.700 --> 02:00:23.420]   He's the man who broke movie pants.
[02:00:23.420 --> 02:00:27.620]   Look, me and my daughter, it's OK.
[02:00:27.620 --> 02:00:28.860]   I'm going to tell you all secret.
[02:00:28.860 --> 02:00:31.460]   And when we pass if you come find me and you want to yell at me
[02:00:31.460 --> 02:00:33.580]   or cancel my account, don't matter, y'all broke now.
[02:00:33.580 --> 02:00:37.220]   This is how dumb and inadequate their system was.
[02:00:37.220 --> 02:00:41.220]   My local movie theater had a cheap day on Tuesdays
[02:00:41.220 --> 02:00:43.060]   where the tickets were half price.
[02:00:43.060 --> 02:00:44.940]   Well, I would take Lee and her friends
[02:00:44.940 --> 02:00:47.380]   and I'd be going to willing to pay for their tickets.
[02:00:47.380 --> 02:00:49.420]   But for some reason, movie paths did not
[02:00:49.420 --> 02:00:52.220]   adjust the amount of money they were paying to the theater.
[02:00:52.220 --> 02:00:55.100]   And I ordered four tickets and they say, oh, that's $0.05.
[02:00:55.100 --> 02:00:57.700]   And I'm like, man, man.
[02:00:57.700 --> 02:01:00.780]   And they said, no, sir, it's going to be $0.05.
[02:01:00.780 --> 02:01:01.500]   And guess what?
[02:01:01.500 --> 02:01:03.780]   Every Tuesday I said, Lee, bring your friends.
[02:01:03.780 --> 02:01:05.100]   Why are you going to be a movie?
[02:01:05.100 --> 02:01:06.060]   This is gold.
[02:01:06.060 --> 02:01:09.500]   When I was a kid, that's how much movies cost to nickel.
[02:01:09.500 --> 02:01:12.060]   And actually, dad, if you're nickel,
[02:01:12.060 --> 02:01:14.820]   you'd get the movie and a box of popcorn.
[02:01:14.820 --> 02:01:15.780]   Let me tell you something.
[02:01:15.780 --> 02:01:18.140]   Parents out here thinking I'm rich beyond the riches
[02:01:18.140 --> 02:01:20.260]   because I'm paying for their kids to go to the movies.
[02:01:20.260 --> 02:01:22.020]   Now, knowing I'm only paying for my sins,
[02:01:22.020 --> 02:01:23.060]   thank you, movie paths.
[02:01:23.060 --> 02:01:25.100]   I appreciate you and love you.
[02:01:25.100 --> 02:01:28.500]   And I apologize to y'all, bro, I am definitely one of--
[02:01:28.500 --> 02:01:29.380]   I'm a power user.
[02:01:29.380 --> 02:01:31.340]   They weren't expecting somebody like this.
[02:01:31.340 --> 02:01:32.780]   They weren't expecting the training source
[02:01:32.780 --> 02:01:33.860]   for them to come through.
[02:01:33.860 --> 02:01:37.900]   You're like the guy who goes to the all you can eat buffet
[02:01:37.900 --> 02:01:39.100]   and basically wipes it out.
[02:01:39.100 --> 02:01:40.700]   I bet you do that, actually.
[02:01:40.700 --> 02:01:42.100]   I've been throwing out a buffet.
[02:01:42.100 --> 02:01:43.660]   It's been throwing out a powerful.
[02:01:43.660 --> 02:01:45.460]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:01:45.460 --> 02:01:46.340]   Now, see, I'm fat.
[02:01:46.340 --> 02:01:47.820]   I ain't never been thrown out of no buffet.
[02:01:47.820 --> 02:01:48.820]   I've been looked at.
[02:01:48.820 --> 02:01:49.660]   Oh, I've been thrown out.
[02:01:49.660 --> 02:01:51.020]   But I ain't nobody come up to me now.
[02:01:51.020 --> 02:01:53.340]   You've been thrown out for eating too much?
[02:01:53.340 --> 02:01:54.340]   Oh, yeah.
[02:01:54.340 --> 02:01:55.780]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:01:55.780 --> 02:01:58.540]   Well, sir, it was such a such price or what have you
[02:01:58.540 --> 02:01:59.900]   and I just keep breaking in.
[02:01:59.900 --> 02:02:02.300]   I mean, I have a big appetite.
[02:02:02.300 --> 02:02:03.940]   I mean, I'm not that big of a guy,
[02:02:03.940 --> 02:02:05.340]   but I have a really big appetite.
[02:02:05.340 --> 02:02:06.100]   And I was also--
[02:02:06.100 --> 02:02:08.820]   --in these buffets and just eat.
[02:02:08.820 --> 02:02:11.340]   And then there was a time or two where it was a challenge
[02:02:11.340 --> 02:02:13.340]   just to see, well, can I get thrown out today?
[02:02:13.340 --> 02:02:15.940]   And then, you know, one of me and my best friend, we would go,
[02:02:15.940 --> 02:02:17.380]   he's a big meathead too.
[02:02:17.380 --> 02:02:19.980]   So we would just go and just crush it.
[02:02:19.980 --> 02:02:20.780]   Wow.
[02:02:20.780 --> 02:02:22.500]   Just see what could happen.
[02:02:22.500 --> 02:02:25.500]   Golden Corral is one of my favorite ones.
[02:02:25.500 --> 02:02:29.540]   So, Aunt Broke Golden Corral, you broke Movie Pass.
[02:02:29.540 --> 02:02:32.900]   What did you breakhead, bud, huh?
[02:02:32.900 --> 02:02:35.340]   You know, I wish I knew.
[02:02:35.340 --> 02:02:38.660]   Wish you had the economics power of these guys.
[02:02:38.660 --> 02:02:39.420]   He's smart.
[02:02:39.420 --> 02:02:40.660]   He's not going to put it out there.
[02:02:40.660 --> 02:02:42.020]   He's not trying to set himself up.
[02:02:42.020 --> 02:02:45.620]   Speaking of economic power, Fortnite announced a couple of months
[02:02:45.620 --> 02:02:52.100]   ago that they were making $150 million a day on iOS.
[02:02:52.100 --> 02:02:55.620]   This is for a free game, but there's in app purchases.
[02:02:55.620 --> 02:02:58.140]   And of course, that means Apple made $50 million a day
[02:02:58.140 --> 02:02:59.660]   because they take a third of it.
[02:02:59.660 --> 02:03:01.580]   I bet you they won't send out alerts to tell you
[02:03:01.580 --> 02:03:03.020]   that you've been on that game for 60 years.
[02:03:03.020 --> 02:03:04.020]   No, no, no.
[02:03:04.020 --> 02:03:05.180]   And you didn't go to school with it.
[02:03:05.180 --> 02:03:06.300]   They say, do you want to dance move?
[02:03:06.300 --> 02:03:08.220]   It's only $5.
[02:03:08.220 --> 02:03:09.780]   Yep.
[02:03:09.780 --> 02:03:11.220]   That game is horrible.
[02:03:11.220 --> 02:03:12.860]   I love it.
[02:03:12.860 --> 02:03:14.220]   I want to let my daughter play it.
[02:03:14.220 --> 02:03:16.020]   No, I wouldn't let my daughter play it.
[02:03:16.020 --> 02:03:19.620]   I can't-- again, you got to keep your kids away from crack OK.
[02:03:19.620 --> 02:03:21.460]   You don't want your kids to do hair with something hair
[02:03:21.460 --> 02:03:22.460]   with the bag.
[02:03:22.460 --> 02:03:24.380]   Fortnite is a drug.
[02:03:24.380 --> 02:03:28.220]   So it's coming to Android, but this is interesting.
[02:03:28.220 --> 02:03:30.460]   Tim Sweeney, the CEO of Epic, said,
[02:03:30.460 --> 02:03:32.940]   we're not going to put it in the Play Store.
[02:03:32.940 --> 02:03:33.660]   Good for them.
[02:03:33.660 --> 02:03:35.860]   Now, remember, Apple doesn't let you choose.
[02:03:35.860 --> 02:03:38.900]   So Apple, they had to give them their 30%.
[02:03:38.900 --> 02:03:40.340]   But they say, no, you know what?
[02:03:40.340 --> 02:03:43.100]   We won all $150 million.
[02:03:43.100 --> 02:03:43.940]   We won it all.
[02:03:43.940 --> 02:03:44.540]   Blame them?
[02:03:44.540 --> 02:03:45.140]   No.
[02:03:45.140 --> 02:03:46.740]   So we're going to sideload it.
[02:03:46.740 --> 02:03:48.460]   But maybe you can blame them for this.
[02:03:48.460 --> 02:03:49.620]   Some people have.
[02:03:49.620 --> 02:03:52.220]   In order to do that, you have to turn off
[02:03:52.220 --> 02:03:54.380]   the feature that protects you on Android that says,
[02:03:54.380 --> 02:03:56.260]   only download apps in the Play Store.
[02:03:56.260 --> 02:03:59.140]   You have to say, and it'll give you a big warning.
[02:03:59.140 --> 02:04:00.060]   This is not secure.
[02:04:00.060 --> 02:04:02.380]   You shouldn't get apps from anywhere but the Play Store.
[02:04:02.380 --> 02:04:06.140]   But you can sideload it from the Fortnite website.
[02:04:06.140 --> 02:04:07.640]   And that's how you destroy a movie
[02:04:07.640 --> 02:04:11.980]   pass on Android phones by not paying them their fair share
[02:04:11.980 --> 02:04:14.620]   when you're making all this money handover fist.
[02:04:14.620 --> 02:04:17.120]   Just go through the store and pay to cut.
[02:04:17.120 --> 02:04:19.260]   I like that.
[02:04:19.260 --> 02:04:20.180]   That's an interesting take.
[02:04:20.180 --> 02:04:21.020]   All right?
[02:04:21.020 --> 02:04:23.140]   It doesn't change the player's point of view.
[02:04:23.140 --> 02:04:25.340]   In a way, you're taking advantage of people
[02:04:25.340 --> 02:04:26.740]   'cause they're going to make their phone less secure.
[02:04:26.740 --> 02:04:29.100]   And how many people are going to turn that back on?
[02:04:29.100 --> 02:04:30.660]   And how many people even understand
[02:04:30.660 --> 02:04:32.940]   that that's what they're doing with their device?
[02:04:32.940 --> 02:04:35.420]   And especially because mostly a lot of kids play it,
[02:04:35.420 --> 02:04:37.940]   you're setting your kid up to be vulnerable.
[02:04:37.940 --> 02:04:39.180]   I don't like that at all.
[02:04:39.180 --> 02:04:41.500]   There's also the question of maybe it will impede
[02:04:41.500 --> 02:04:42.860]   the number of people who install Fortnite
[02:04:42.860 --> 02:04:45.100]   because I bet you a lot of people don't even know
[02:04:45.100 --> 02:04:46.340]   how do I do that?
[02:04:46.340 --> 02:04:47.180]   What do you mean?
[02:04:47.180 --> 02:04:48.300]   I can't get at the Play Store.
[02:04:48.300 --> 02:04:50.460]   If it's not in the Play Store, it may not exist
[02:04:50.460 --> 02:04:51.460]   for a lot of people.
[02:04:51.460 --> 02:04:53.820]   - And what if it's buggy because it's not regulated at all
[02:04:53.820 --> 02:04:56.780]   and it's just killing your, all kinds of problems with that.
[02:04:56.780 --> 02:04:57.780]   I don't like it.
[02:04:57.780 --> 02:04:59.580]   Pineapple, pineapples.
[02:04:59.580 --> 02:05:00.420]   I don't like it.
[02:05:00.420 --> 02:05:02.180]   - I bet the kids that are playing Fortnite
[02:05:02.180 --> 02:05:05.260]   and are curious about getting this on Android,
[02:05:05.260 --> 02:05:07.460]   they already know how to do all this stuff.
[02:05:07.460 --> 02:05:09.580]   They already know how to go in and flip the tacos
[02:05:09.580 --> 02:05:11.220]   and whatnot.
[02:05:11.220 --> 02:05:13.780]   Heck, they're probably even running their own VPNs on phones.
[02:05:13.780 --> 02:05:15.500]   Those kids are, you know?
[02:05:15.500 --> 02:05:17.780]   - You're giving kids a lot of credit, bro.
[02:05:17.780 --> 02:05:18.940]   I'm not here.
[02:05:18.940 --> 02:05:19.780]   I'm not here.
[02:05:19.780 --> 02:05:21.540]   - I bet it's a pretty sharp.
[02:05:21.540 --> 02:05:23.060]   - I don't know, maybe it's a car in the country I live in.
[02:05:23.060 --> 02:05:25.020]   I'm not here coaching and I'm listening to kids
[02:05:25.020 --> 02:05:25.860]   all about Fortnite.
[02:05:25.860 --> 02:05:27.700]   I don't even know if they know they know they're ABCs yet,
[02:05:27.700 --> 02:05:28.540]   man.
[02:05:28.540 --> 02:05:29.380]   - Yeah.
[02:05:29.380 --> 02:05:30.220]   - I don't know.
[02:05:30.220 --> 02:05:31.820]   - There's a little bit of that around here too.
[02:05:31.820 --> 02:05:34.060]   - I just, I want them to pay their fair share.
[02:05:34.060 --> 02:05:35.180]   That's all I'm saying.
[02:05:35.180 --> 02:05:37.020]   I don't like that.
[02:05:37.020 --> 02:05:38.620]   - Ed Bot, do you have any opinion?
[02:05:39.620 --> 02:05:40.940]   - Well, no.
[02:05:40.940 --> 02:05:46.940]   You know, the 30% racket for all of the online stores
[02:05:46.940 --> 02:05:51.100]   is, you know, sometimes it's justified.
[02:05:51.100 --> 02:05:54.620]   Sometimes, like in the case of Amazon,
[02:05:54.620 --> 02:06:02.620]   it's just a, it's a blunt force instrument of competition.
[02:06:03.620 --> 02:06:12.620]   And, you know, so I understand the argument about building a curated store,
[02:06:12.620 --> 02:06:17.620]   but I also saw the service revenues that Apple reported
[02:06:17.620 --> 02:06:19.620]   in its most recent quarter and...
[02:06:19.620 --> 02:06:23.620]   - More than 10 billion more than the American iPad together.
[02:06:23.620 --> 02:06:25.620]   - Yeah, yeah, they're not, they're not hurting.
[02:06:25.620 --> 02:06:27.620]   They're not hurting there on that.
[02:06:27.620 --> 02:06:29.620]   So I think there's probably some room.
[02:06:29.620 --> 02:06:30.620]   - They're making some billion.
[02:06:30.620 --> 02:06:32.620]   How much is everybody else making?
[02:06:32.620 --> 02:06:35.620]   And you wouldn't be able to make any money if they didn't offer you the service.
[02:06:35.620 --> 02:06:37.620]   - Well, I mean, it's a give and take.
[02:06:37.620 --> 02:06:41.620]   - Some developers like it because they don't have to worry about distribution at all.
[02:06:41.620 --> 02:06:42.620]   They don't have to think about it.
[02:06:42.620 --> 02:06:43.620]   They don't have to think about bandwidth.
[02:06:43.620 --> 02:06:44.620]   There's no costs.
[02:06:44.620 --> 02:06:45.620]   They just put it on the store.
[02:06:45.620 --> 02:06:48.620]   Now, some developers don't like the fact that you have to get through the store.
[02:06:48.620 --> 02:06:49.620]   The store is quite a gatekeeper.
[02:06:49.620 --> 02:06:51.620]   There's a lot of apps you couldn't get on there
[02:06:51.620 --> 02:06:54.620]   because Apple is kind of prudish and so forth.
[02:06:54.620 --> 02:07:00.620]   - In general, the only developers who are making big bucks
[02:07:00.620 --> 02:07:09.620]   on any mobile store are those with sticky, addictive things like games.
[02:07:09.620 --> 02:07:14.620]   Games and things with in-app purchases.
[02:07:14.620 --> 02:07:17.620]   The companies that have been devastated,
[02:07:17.620 --> 02:07:19.620]   the developers that have been devastated
[02:07:19.620 --> 02:07:21.620]   are the ones that are making productivity apps
[02:07:21.620 --> 02:07:25.620]   where they don't have 30% to give up.
[02:07:25.620 --> 02:07:38.620]   And they were once able to legitimately charge 50 bucks for an app or $99 per app.
[02:07:38.620 --> 02:07:39.620]   - What?
[02:07:39.620 --> 02:07:41.620]   - Look at how much Windows Microsoft Office was.
[02:07:41.620 --> 02:07:44.620]   - Well, yeah, but I mean, we can even go down from there.
[02:07:44.620 --> 02:07:52.620]   But where in order to pay for the time the developer takes to develop that app,
[02:07:52.620 --> 02:07:58.620]   the debug it to test it, to support it and to upgrade it.
[02:07:58.620 --> 02:08:02.620]   And then the customers are going to say,
[02:08:02.620 --> 02:08:07.620]   "We want it for $99 or $999 or we're not going to pay."
[02:08:07.620 --> 02:08:12.620]   Anything over $999 is like the top of the line.
[02:08:12.620 --> 02:08:14.620]   That's considered expensive.
[02:08:14.620 --> 02:08:20.620]   And so there's, I have talked to developers who had successful apps
[02:08:20.620 --> 02:08:22.620]   who have gone back.
[02:08:22.620 --> 02:08:25.620]   Now they're just working in corporate jobs now,
[02:08:25.620 --> 02:08:31.620]   writing, doing websites and line of business apps
[02:08:31.620 --> 02:08:39.620]   because their really good productivity app is no longer a thing.
[02:08:39.620 --> 02:08:41.620]   - It's a very bold move by Epic.
[02:08:41.620 --> 02:08:43.620]   It'll be very interesting to see what the impact is.
[02:08:43.620 --> 02:08:46.620]   If it kills Fortnite on Android or if it makes Fortnite sing,
[02:08:46.620 --> 02:08:48.620]   if Epic makes more money, I mean, this will be very interesting.
[02:08:48.620 --> 02:08:52.620]   And if other people follow suit, it could completely destroy the play story.
[02:08:52.620 --> 02:08:54.620]   Of course, it's like the PC.
[02:08:54.620 --> 02:08:59.620]   You could buy in the Windows Store or you can turn off S-mode and buy
[02:08:59.620 --> 02:09:01.620]   and get stuff everywhere else.
[02:09:01.620 --> 02:09:04.620]   - And not everybody's Fortnite. - I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:09:04.620 --> 02:09:06.620]   - Now I was just saying, not everybody's Fortnite.
[02:09:06.620 --> 02:09:07.620]   - Yeah. - So.
[02:09:07.620 --> 02:09:08.620]   - Yeah, not everybody can do that.
[02:09:08.620 --> 02:09:10.620]   Go ahead. What was the question, Matt?
[02:09:10.620 --> 02:09:15.620]   - What's the model for people like Atlassian and Jira that have,
[02:09:15.620 --> 02:09:19.620]   you know, their big platforms for corporations and whatnot,
[02:09:19.620 --> 02:09:23.620]   but then they also have a mobile app and I mean, is it that they're just sort of writing off
[02:09:23.620 --> 02:09:26.620]   that mobile app is just something they have as an option?
[02:09:26.620 --> 02:09:28.620]   - Exactly. - But we're just banking solely on the platform.
[02:09:28.620 --> 02:09:34.620]   - Exactly. The mobile app is free and the subscription is where you make the money.
[02:09:34.620 --> 02:09:38.620]   And in fact, those are two very good examples because they're freemiums, right?
[02:09:38.620 --> 02:09:41.620]   And most people who use Slack, for instance, don't pay for Slack.
[02:09:41.620 --> 02:09:47.620]   - Yeah, 95% is typically, if you can get 5% of your users
[02:09:47.620 --> 02:09:53.620]   to pay the premium, you can usually make a profit.
[02:09:53.620 --> 02:09:55.620]   - It's an interesting model. - Yeah.
[02:09:55.620 --> 02:09:56.620]   - Nice.
[02:09:56.620 --> 02:09:59.620]   - I think we should wrap this up, don't you?
[02:09:59.620 --> 02:10:01.620]   I think it's gone on too long.
[02:10:01.620 --> 02:10:04.620]   (both laugh)
[02:10:04.620 --> 02:10:08.620]   - This is definitely an episode that I hope you--
[02:10:08.620 --> 02:10:10.620]   - I'm going to raise my glass to Ann to hear the other--
[02:10:10.620 --> 02:10:14.620]   - Just hope you brought your Merlot, your Brown liquor, your popcorn.
[02:10:14.620 --> 02:10:17.620]   Oh, and JJ Stone brought his movie pass.
[02:10:17.620 --> 02:10:19.620]   (both laugh)
[02:10:19.620 --> 02:10:21.620]   - So after this show, I got to show you something.
[02:10:21.620 --> 02:10:27.620]   I had Leah's doing YouTube videos and she did a movie reaction video on Cleo.
[02:10:27.620 --> 02:10:28.620]   - Oh, fun.
[02:10:28.620 --> 02:10:31.620]   And by the way, YouTube is where you find this new Ninja Parenting Podcast, too.
[02:10:31.620 --> 02:10:32.620]   What's the channel?
[02:10:32.620 --> 02:10:38.620]   - It's everything's on iqmz.com, so if you go there, you'll find it.
[02:10:38.620 --> 02:10:45.620]   Like I said, doing a raise in the Ninja thing, because people always ask me how I got my kid out here fighting and killing and learning in these streets.
[02:10:45.620 --> 02:10:54.620]   And then I also put a thing on iqmz tech showing the camera that I use, the software I use, the voice that's how I get looking so luxurious on your show.
[02:10:54.620 --> 02:10:56.620]   Not me, just the stream coming through.
[02:10:56.620 --> 02:11:00.620]   I don't look luxurious, but the picture goes and the bouquet and all that stuff behind me.
[02:11:00.620 --> 02:11:06.620]   So if you go there, you can see a list of everything that I use and I have, and it is awesome.
[02:11:06.620 --> 02:11:07.620]   - Very nice.
[02:11:07.620 --> 02:11:08.620]   - Very nice.
[02:11:08.620 --> 02:11:10.620]   iqmz.com.
[02:11:10.620 --> 02:11:15.620]   And Pruitt, is it a contributing writer for the fabulous tech republic?
[02:11:15.620 --> 02:11:17.620]   He's also @underscarprud on Twitter.
[02:11:17.620 --> 02:11:18.620]   Anything you want to plug?
[02:11:18.620 --> 02:11:20.620]   You're doing those Friday night videos, right?
[02:11:20.620 --> 02:11:24.620]   - Yeah, I had another fun night live editing Friday.
[02:11:24.620 --> 02:11:27.620]   And that's the thing.
[02:11:27.620 --> 02:11:34.620]   I like for people to go and check out my YouTube channel and just hop in and leave a comment on some stuff that you like or dislike.
[02:11:34.620 --> 02:11:40.620]   So I know what exactly everybody is wanting from photography and just digital content creation stuff.
[02:11:40.620 --> 02:11:42.620]   This is not always photography.
[02:11:42.620 --> 02:11:47.620]   I also did a live stream for editing some video stuff.
[02:11:47.620 --> 02:11:50.620]   I think it was doing some lower thirds and things like that.
[02:11:50.620 --> 02:11:52.620]   - He's the drone master too.
[02:11:52.620 --> 02:11:56.620]   Great drone pilot.
[02:11:56.620 --> 02:11:58.620]   - Yeah, fun flying my drones.
[02:11:58.620 --> 02:11:59.620]   - That's nice.
[02:11:59.620 --> 02:12:02.620]   - I need to come hang out with you and get my drone game up.
[02:12:02.620 --> 02:12:03.620]   - You bet.
[02:12:03.620 --> 02:12:04.620]   - I'm on down.
[02:12:04.620 --> 02:12:05.620]   - I do fly.
[02:12:05.620 --> 02:12:06.620]   I'm a rogue flyer.
[02:12:06.620 --> 02:12:08.620]   I'm not really, you know.
[02:12:08.620 --> 02:12:12.620]   - I'm a drone over here with me.
[02:12:12.620 --> 02:12:15.620]   - You find answer YouTube channel YouTube.com/Aprood.
[02:12:15.620 --> 02:12:17.620]   That's the smallest thing he is.
[02:12:17.620 --> 02:12:18.620]   What is that?
[02:12:18.620 --> 02:12:19.620]   - Hey, don't worry about what I'm doing.
[02:12:19.620 --> 02:12:20.620]   I'm flying.
[02:12:20.620 --> 02:12:22.620]   - Did that come in a cereal box, Owen?
[02:12:22.620 --> 02:12:23.620]   What the hell?
[02:12:23.620 --> 02:12:25.620]   - This is a, this is a pillow.
[02:12:25.620 --> 02:12:26.620]   - There is a drone.
[02:12:26.620 --> 02:12:28.620]   That's a manly drone.
[02:12:28.620 --> 02:12:29.620]   - Okay.
[02:12:29.620 --> 02:12:30.620]   - But there's one problem.
[02:12:30.620 --> 02:12:31.620]   - Oh, oh.
[02:12:31.620 --> 02:12:32.620]   - I know you got the toys.
[02:12:32.620 --> 02:12:33.620]   This is Lee's drone.
[02:12:33.620 --> 02:12:34.620]   Okay.
[02:12:34.620 --> 02:12:35.620]   - Oh, okay.
[02:12:35.620 --> 02:12:36.620]   That's different.
[02:12:36.620 --> 02:12:37.620]   - This is Lee's drone.
[02:12:37.620 --> 02:12:38.620]   It flies itself pretty much.
[02:12:38.620 --> 02:12:39.620]   - Yeah.
[02:12:39.620 --> 02:12:40.620]   That's what you need.
[02:12:40.620 --> 02:12:46.620]   Because Leo, this Leo over here is really good at flying drones into things.
[02:12:46.620 --> 02:12:47.620]   - The worst.
[02:12:47.620 --> 02:12:49.620]   - Including the Caribbean last drone.
[02:12:49.620 --> 02:12:50.620]   And I'm never buying another drone.
[02:12:50.620 --> 02:12:51.620]   That's it.
[02:12:51.620 --> 02:12:52.620]   - You are banned, sir.
[02:12:52.620 --> 02:12:53.620]   - A banned.
[02:12:53.620 --> 02:12:54.620]   A banned from drone life.
[02:12:54.620 --> 02:12:57.620]   Ed Bot writes regularly the Ed Bot report.
[02:12:57.620 --> 02:13:01.620]   ZD net must read, including his Surface Go review.
[02:13:01.620 --> 02:13:02.620]   Lots more.
[02:13:02.620 --> 02:13:03.620]   It's, wait a minute.
[02:13:03.620 --> 02:13:05.620]   How to upgrade from home to pro for free?
[02:13:05.620 --> 02:13:06.620]   Wait a minute.
[02:13:06.620 --> 02:13:07.620]   How can I do that?
[02:13:07.620 --> 02:13:11.620]   Oh, I guess I'll have to read the Ed Bot report.
[02:13:11.620 --> 02:13:14.620]   - It's been, it's been, it's, it's a really popular post.
[02:13:14.620 --> 02:13:15.620]   I've just updated it.
[02:13:15.620 --> 02:13:16.620]   - Nice.
[02:13:16.620 --> 02:13:17.620]   - That.
[02:13:17.620 --> 02:13:22.820]   - Cause I, cause I got this, you know, I wanted to up trade to pro cause I want to bit locker
[02:13:22.820 --> 02:13:25.620]   on my new Surface Go and they wanted 99 bucks.
[02:13:25.620 --> 02:13:26.620]   So.
[02:13:26.620 --> 02:13:30.620]   - And if you read this article, it will explain to you how you can do it without paying the
[02:13:30.620 --> 02:13:37.260]   99 bucks and I'll bet now it's, there's, there's no trick in there, but I'll bet you meet the
[02:13:37.260 --> 02:13:38.260]   qualifications for it.
[02:13:38.260 --> 02:13:45.620]   I'll bet you've got a drawer or a box in your garage that has the product key that you need.
[02:13:45.620 --> 02:13:46.620]   - Okay.
[02:13:46.620 --> 02:13:48.620]   It's in there somewhere.
[02:13:48.620 --> 02:13:51.300]   Ed Bot at ZD net.
[02:13:51.300 --> 02:13:53.460]   Ladies and gentlemen, I'm so glad you were here today.
[02:13:53.460 --> 02:13:57.580]   I hope you brought some Brown liquor and popcorn cause this was quite the show.
[02:13:57.580 --> 02:13:59.380]   - Oh, it's a lagavoula.
[02:13:59.380 --> 02:14:01.380]   It's a lagavoulan, baby.
[02:14:01.380 --> 02:14:02.380]   - Lagavoulan.
[02:14:02.380 --> 02:14:05.380]   - We're talking single malt.
[02:14:05.380 --> 02:14:06.380]   - Yes, sir.
[02:14:06.380 --> 02:14:07.380]   - Yes, sir.
[02:14:07.380 --> 02:14:09.340]   None of these blends for Ant.

[02:14:30.380 --> 02:14:34.620]   We had, let's see, and Ora too, or Anna.
[02:14:34.620 --> 02:14:35.620]   Aha.
[02:14:35.620 --> 02:14:37.380]   Oh, Anna.
[02:14:37.380 --> 02:14:40.380]   Anyway, I see a name.
[02:14:40.380 --> 02:14:41.380]   I can't read it.
[02:14:41.380 --> 02:14:42.380]   John from Modesto.
[02:14:42.380 --> 02:14:45.180]   They're going to end a nice couple, Jessica and Brian from Sacramento.
[02:14:45.180 --> 02:14:47.380]   If you want to be in the studio audience, easy to do.

[02:14:54.660 --> 02:14:55.660]   the pedal in my area.
[02:14:55.660 --> 02:14:56.660]   That's the only catch.
