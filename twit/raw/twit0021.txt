[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000]   Let's do the twit.
[00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.800]   Let's do the twit, baby.
[00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:07.000]   This is Twit, this week in Tech, episode 21 for September 4th, 2005.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   Wow, that's an amazing response.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:28.080]   Thank you everybody, ladies and gentlemen, and you probably gathered we're not alone.
[00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.080]   We are not alone.
[00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.800]   We're here at the Apple Store in San Francisco, our first live twit.
[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.120]   And this is really a thrill.
[00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.840]   It's nice to have all of you here in the live audience and of course the people listening
[00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.320]   all around the world who are joining us and the twits at the table today.
[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.240]   And let me go down the table and introduce everybody, of course, the lovely, intaminated
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.440]   Patrick Norton.
[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.760]   Patrick, even though there's a live audience, the radio audience at home can't see you
[00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:55.760]   wave.
[00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.880]   So you might wave verbally.
[00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.880]   Hi everybody.
[00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.160]   David Prager is also here.
[00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.160]   Hey, David.
[00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:05.360]   How you doing?
[00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.720]   The lovely, talented Robert Herron for PC Magazine Labs.
[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:10.720]   Hello.
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:11.720]   Hello.
[00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.000]   Kevin Rose is here.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.640]   Kevin Rose brought his entourage.
[00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:16.640]   Yes.
[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.840]   He brought the revision three crew with me.
[00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.040]   You've got Keith Harrison videotaping.
[00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.360]   Yeah, we're going to launch this as a download too.
[00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.600]   This will be the first video ever of a twit.
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.600]   Cool.
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.480]   We've been together before so we really couldn't do it very easily to a video.
[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:31.480]   We looked at different ways to do it.
[00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.960]   In fact, we tried that eye check conferencing but it just really, we didn't have the bandwidth
[00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:35.960]   to make that work.
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:36.960]   So close.
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:37.960]   It looks like a Brady bunch intro.
[00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:38.960]   It did.
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.040]   Here's the story of three geeky guys.
[00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.840]   Ladies and gentlemen, John C. Devorek.
[00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:43.840]   Hello.
[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:50.640]   He gets, say it with me, he gets no spam.
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:51.720]   I don't.
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.520]   I don't know why this has become a big deal.
[00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.880]   Because you're the only one in North America who doesn't.
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.960]   He gets no.
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.360]   Let's do that one more time because I really want some volume.
[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.760]   You're just going to use this on it.
[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:05.920]   You're going to use this as a role.
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.560]   It's going to be part of our music.
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.560]   Ashley Twitt has already recorded.
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:10.560]   He gets.
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.560]   Oh, damn.
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.120]   Oh, my God.
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.760]   And now we have, I'm really pleased to say joining us right now, Roger McGwin, who is,
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.240]   of course, the man who is famous for the birds and for his own solo career, eight miles
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.280]   high.
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.760]   You've heard.
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.760]   Yeah.
[00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.600]   You're kind of a gadget hound, aren't you?
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:37.600]   Yes, I am.
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:38.600]   Yeah, I love it.
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:39.600]   Yeah.
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:40.600]   Up tech.
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:41.600]   So he sent us an email.
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:42.600]   He said, "I want to be in San Francisco."
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:43.600]   He kind of come by.
[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:44.600]   He actually brought some stuff to show.
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:45.600]   We'll talk about that in just a little bit.
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.240]   And you've known Devorek for a few years.
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.240]   About 10 years.
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.760]   He invented this guitar.
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:50.760]   Seriously.
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:51.760]   What do you mean?
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:52.760]   I really did.
[00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:53.760]   That's why I brought it.
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:54.760]   It's a seven string.
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:55.760]   Seven string, yeah.
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.120]   And they have seven stringing tours, but not this configuration.
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.560]   Well, you're famous for your beautiful 12 string playing.
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.560]   Right.
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:02.800]   Is this kind of a cross between six and 12?
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:03.800]   Yes, exactly.
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:04.800]   That's what it is.
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.800]   It's got the cool G string parallel.
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:14.600]   It's like the best part of it, 12 string, is this part here like a...
[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.920]   It's almost like a sitari kind of resonance in the background.
[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:18.920]   Yeah.
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.280]   It's got a high string and a low string.
[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.840]   So I've got that.
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.720]   And then I had a regular six string aside from that so you can bend it.
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.720]   That's beautiful.
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.200]   So it gives it like a bluesy thing, but you can do the 12 string thing too.
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.200]   But this is a Martin.
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.000]   So you not only invented it, but it's actually being manufactured.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.600]   I had Martin make me one and then a couple of guys came up and said, "Hey, I want one
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:39.600]   too."
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.960]   So Martin decided to make a special edition of his brain.
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:42.960]   That's really neat.
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:43.960]   It's called the HD7.
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:44.960]   The HD7.
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.960]   Well, it's not exactly tech, but it's pretty cool.
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:47.960]   It's low tech.
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:48.960]   It's a gadget.
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.760]   It's a wooden steel tech.
[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.080]   As Devorek pointed out before we got started, there are people in the audience with their
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.800]   blogging even as we speak.
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:57.800]   Is that wild?
[00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:58.800]   Well, he's actually...
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.720]   He says now that he's not blogging live.
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.400]   He's making a movie.
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.400]   Making a movie.
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:08.560]   So there'll be a competitor to the official Twitter video.
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.360]   I'm going to see if I can get...
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.360]   Matt, would you get me the handheld?
[00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.040]   It's also going to be a great shot of your ass, Leo.
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.040]   Thank you.
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.280]   Just to write you some of the microphone.
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.240]   He had the fact he had to do a panorama.
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:23.320]   I noticed he panned away from my backside.
[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.520]   You could just remove it.
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.960]   So we actually have a bit of a setup.
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.520]   We also have a lot more people here that we're going to get on Mike later on.
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.520]   What's your name?
[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:35.520]   I'm AJ.
[00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:36.520]   AJ, what are you doing?
[00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:37.680]   I'm recording you guys.
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:38.680]   On your eyesight.
[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:39.680]   Yes I am.
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:40.680]   And then what are you going to do with that?
[00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.680]   I'm going to share with my friends who weren't able to make it today.
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:43.520]   You could post it if you want.
[00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.200]   If you want me to serve it, I'll be glad to for you.
[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:47.200]   Alright.
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.200]   Cool.
[00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.200]   I'm going to have a audition for the revision 3D.
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.200]   It's all great.
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.280]   What format are you recording?
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:54.800]   What are you recording in AJ?
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:55.800]   What format?
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.640]   It's just QuickTime.
[00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.960]   QuickTime recording in 2iMovie.
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.160]   So you could make 264 or it's DV.
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.160]   It's Firewire.
[00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.160]   Do H264, whatever.
[00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.160]   Yeah.
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.160]   It's okay quality.
[00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.040]   So you know Apple put it in this invitation.
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.840]   Did you get one John with the blue denim, the jeans, the pocket of the jeans?
[00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:16.840]   No I don't get any.
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.520]   The biggest revolution since a thousand songs in your pocket.
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.160]   They invited everybody to this thing Wednesday.
[00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.160]   Yeah.
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.160]   Yeah I'm going.
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.720]   Well I'm going too but do you think they'll be a surprise because an analyst like the
[00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:28.720]   next day.
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.080]   Well you know we should talk about that here on the show.
[00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.440]   We've got all these brainiacs here and maybe some gossip mongers out there and maybe somebody
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:34.440]   knows.
[00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.880]   Well because I talked to Mark off the other day about it and he says that everyone's still
[00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:40.040]   trying to guess what they're up with.
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:41.040]   John Mark off the New York Times.
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.160]   Well he doesn't know.
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:46.040]   But this analyst I can't remember his Morgan Stanley or whatever but he said oh no it's
[00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:49.200]   singular is going to do the telemotorilla phone it'll be the iTunes phone.
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.200]   It's kind of boring.
[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:51.200]   It is boring.
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.160]   It doesn't sound like as big an announcement as the original iPod.
[00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.160]   No.
[00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.160]   I want the video iPod.
[00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:56.160]   Who wants a video iPod?
[00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.160]   How many of you think it's a video iPod?
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:58.160]   Definitely one.
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.960]   Well doesn't Steve say that video iPods are bad isn't it?
[00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:01.960]   Jobs it's the spot.
[00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:05.560]   Yeah that's what he says because right now he's milking it with this overpriced iPod.
[00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:06.560]   It's going to change his mind.
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:10.960]   He's going to say until the sales start to flop a little bit then he'll jack into a
[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:11.960]   wheel of his mind.
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:12.960]   It changes mind.
[00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:13.960]   Can we say this stuff in the Apple store?
[00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:14.960]   We like to.
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.960]   They can throw us out of it.
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:21.960]   I actually would say overpriced I mean considering what the prestige is.
[00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.960]   It's a cool thing.
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:25.960]   It's a thing of beauty.
[00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:28.160]   It's a work of art.
[00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:29.680]   John's not worried about being thrown out.
[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:32.640]   He's worried about getting through the horde of angry Apple fans between him and the front
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:33.640]   door.
[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:38.240]   Hey move your microphone a little bit closer to your mouth there because you're not as
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.240]   loud as the rest of the room.
[00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:40.240]   Maybe Apple's.
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.240]   Roger Williams pulled out his iPod.
[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.240]   He's whipped out of it.
[00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:44.240]   Whipped out your iPod.
[00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.240]   How many of you have iPods?
[00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:46.240]   Yes.
[00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.240]   They're whipping out their iPods.
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:49.240]   There's a mini.
[00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:50.240]   There's a regular iPod.
[00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.240]   I have four but they're all at home.
[00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:56.120]   You see maybe Apple's going to announce a countersuit to creative, creative suing Apple
[00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:58.760]   because of the fact for patenting their interface.
[00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:00.680]   Apple tried to patent the interface in 2002.
[00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:02.240]   They hadn't gone through yet.
[00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:04.600]   But it's just that patent thing is just nested menus.
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:09.480]   Well it's, we, you know, here's an interesting, because a patent lawyer sent me an email after
[00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:13.560]   we talked about it because remember we said Microsoft got there first and patented it.
[00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:15.840]   And this guy said, first of all nobody got there.
[00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:17.000]   No patents have been approved.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.160]   So nobody, nobody has the rights.
[00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.280]   And he says it's not exactly what anybody's been saying.
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:23.880]   Of course I don't have the email in front of me so I can't.
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:25.480]   But this creative is a real patent.
[00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:26.920]   I mean obviously they're pursuing it.
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:31.000]   So they have a patent and they're suing Apple.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.720]   John's fascinated by the iPod interface.
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:34.160]   Have you ever seen that before John?
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:35.160]   No.
[00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:36.600]   It's a pretty cool thing isn't it?
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:37.600]   It's in color.
[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:38.600]   It's in color.
[00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:39.600]   This one is.
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:41.000]   You give it a screen which bigger could be video.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.720]   It's got problems of its own though they shipped something like 10,000 neon's to Asia.
[00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:46.720]   4,000?
[00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:49.080]   4,000 units to Japan with a worm on the install software.
[00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:51.160]   They put a windows worm on the software.
[00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:53.160]   What's that?
[00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:54.160]   Scan disks.
[00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.960]   What, so they recall them all?
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:58.880]   Nobody seems to be following up on that.
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:01.080]   Nobody's heard anything from creative about it.
[00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:02.480]   It's just a patient.
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:08.880]   Well, if you, I mean one thing it's like it's horrible that somebody shipping, you know,
[00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:11.960]   where an install disc is CD with a worm on it.
[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:18.080]   But the flip side is, you know, 4,000 CDs for installing a creative product that's not
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:19.520]   particularly popular anywhere.
[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:21.520]   The me on.
[00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:26.760]   Followed by the fact that, you know, Windows XP is getting ransacked on a daily basis anytime
[00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:27.760]   you go online.
[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:29.280]   It's like, yeah, big deal.
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:32.120]   Keith, I hope you're getting this Roger McQuinne showing John DeVorick how to use
[00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:33.280]   an iPod.
[00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:35.760]   That's a moment in history.
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:37.760]   Hey, how you doing?
[00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:42.560]   So, another story.
[00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:44.680]   I think we've lost all interest in this one.
[00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:45.680]   Have we?
[00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:46.680]   Is there anything more to say?
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:47.680]   Creative suing, Apple?
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:48.680]   I mean, is that a big story?
[00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:49.680]   Is there something to say there?
[00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:50.680]   It's interesting.
[00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:55.160]   It's kind of there's, there's so many lawsuits going around the portable interfaces right
[00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:56.160]   now.
[00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:57.160]   Right.
[00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:00.320]   You know, the Microsoft in one direction, Apple in another direction.
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:03.880]   Creatives got, I mean ironically creative which has like the ugliest interface on the planet
[00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:08.320]   may have gotten the, you know, the nesting menus or everyone to categorize it, patent
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:09.320]   first.
[00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:10.520]   So, they're going to sue them.
[00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:13.080]   So, it's going to be another long drawn out legal court battle.
[00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:14.240]   See, we talked about this earlier.
[00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:17.880]   I said Microsoft will never sue Apple because they each have their, you know, patents in
[00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:21.000]   their back pocket that could cause a shooting war back and forth.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.440]   But what does creative got to lose?
[00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:25.920]   I mean, they're kind of, are they not kind of out of the business practice?
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:26.920]   They can't sell their stuff.
[00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:31.200]   Well, they're actually, they're the second largest provider of portable media devices
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:33.240]   or MP3 players after Apple right now.
[00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:37.040]   I just saw a story saying they're going to start pushing sound cards because they're
[00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:38.760]   giving up on the MP3 market for this.
[00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:40.760]   Well, I was at a table with the CEO two weeks ago.
[00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:41.760]   He says he's going to keep doing it.
[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:44.960]   Yeah, the CEO seems to have a very different opinion.
[00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:49.440]   In terms of sheer volume, they're still turning over the pretty much the largest or from
[00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:53.200]   what I've seen, they're the second largest provider of MP3 players after Apple.
[00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:54.840]   But, well, but I mean Apple's 80%.
[00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:56.240]   So, second largest does a joke.
[00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:57.240]   It doesn't mean.
[00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:59.400]   Well, yeah, but that's like saying AMD is a joke.
[00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:03.480]   You know, if you can get, you know, 10% of an $18 billion market, that's still a fair
[00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:04.480]   amount of change, right?
[00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:08.120]   I think the microprocessor market's a little bigger than the...
[00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:09.320]   I'm not arguing that it is.
[00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:10.320]   Yeah, I can.
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:11.320]   I can argue.
[00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:12.320]   Well, is it?
[00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:13.320]   I guess it is.
[00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:14.320]   Oh.
[00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:15.320]   Yeah.
[00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:16.320]   Because even if iPod has to have an iMac processor, by definition, it would be a bigger
[00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:17.320]   market.
[00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:19.320]   The iPod Plus market.
[00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:25.880]   AMD is, you know, sued Intel now Intel saying they're just a bunch of cry babies.
[00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:29.040]   Did you see that Intel released this week?
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:30.640]   There's a lot of things going on.
[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:34.480]   Well, okay, let's talk about this because we never really talked about this Intel AMD
[00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:36.000]   thing.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.280]   Is this a case of the time-honored tradition of if you can't succeed in the marketplace
[00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:41.280]   sue?
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:43.240]   And that's what creatives do.
[00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:48.320]   If somebody sees somebody that they perceive or are benefiting from illegal activities
[00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:50.080]   from their perspective, they should sue.
[00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:51.080]   They should sue.
[00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:55.760]   It's like if you somebody shot a friend of yours and the governor...
[00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:58.480]   And the police department don't want to do anything about it.
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:10:59.920]   You can always sue for wrongful death.
[00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:04.320]   I mean, there are ways of suing people for doing the, you know, doing wrong things.
[00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:06.040]   Now who's right and who's wrong on the thing?
[00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:07.040]   The courts have to decide.
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:09.680]   But it wasn't thrown out of court.
[00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:10.680]   No, that's right.
[00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:11.680]   It wasn't.
[00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:12.680]   But did you read what Intel said?
[00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:13.680]   I don't have it in front of me.
[00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:16.080]   But Intel was whining and moaning saying, "Oh, it's..."
[00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:18.080]   Right here, I believe.
[00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:20.040]   Kevin's doing Devorax research.
[00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:21.840]   Kevin's got this thing down.
[00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:23.760]   He's got everything you can bring up.
[00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:27.360]   Kevin's got a tab for it on Firefox and he just popped it.
[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:28.360]   Except for that story.
[00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:31.280]   I don't think you sent that one around, Leo.
[00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:33.080]   You forgot to send that one around.
[00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:36.640]   It sounds more like Intel's doing the whining.
[00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:37.800]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:40.840]   I'm saying they said there's no merit to it.
[00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:45.520]   You think that AMD is rightfully complaining that Intel is...
[00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:47.640]   What's the same thing Microsoft was doing there saying?
[00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:49.120]   We'll give you discounts if you...
[00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:53.520]   I recommend people go to the AMD site or you can go to devorax.org/blog@oforax.com.
[00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:55.640]   I recommend...
[00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:59.200]   He has a link to intel.com there if you can't remember that.
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:01.160]   Hey, you know, you'd be surprised.
[00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:05.720]   So anyway, you should go to the AMD site and then click on the complaint and read it for
[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:08.280]   yourself and you make your own decisions.
[00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:09.680]   It's very entertaining reading.
[00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:13.640]   I've read a lot of legal documents in my day, but this is the most fun one I've ever
[00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:14.640]   run into.
[00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:15.640]   It has merit, you think.
[00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:16.640]   It's hilarious.
[00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:17.640]   I never said that.
[00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:21.400]   Because you're very careful not to say things like that.
[00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:22.400]   I'm objective.
[00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:25.000]   He's a journalist, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   You got a...
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   Yes, Patrick.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.080]   Outpost Crystal or the CNET Google debacle?
[00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:32.760]   Well, you know, I kind of want...
[00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:35.080]   We didn't talk about the CNET Google thing when it happened.
[00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:36.080]   It's now...
[00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:37.080]   It's like six weeks old.
[00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:39.120]   But I thought John might have something to say about this.
[00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:40.120]   You heard what happened.
[00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:45.200]   Of course, CNET wrote a story reporter was writing a story on privacy issues with Google
[00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:46.480]   and she used...
[00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:51.680]   She looked up Eric Schmidt, the Google CEO, and using stuff that she found on Google wrote
[00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:55.320]   an article saying, "Look, even Eric Schmidt, the CEO of Google, this stuff..."
[00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:56.320]   And Google hit the roof.
[00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:57.840]   In fact, they cut off CNET.
[00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:59.680]   They said, "We're not going to talk to you anymore for a year."
[00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:02.800]   Well, it seems to me that anyone can do that anytime they want to.
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:04.560]   They don't have to talk to you.
[00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:05.560]   But...
[00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:06.560]   But it's whiny.
[00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:07.560]   That's not...
[00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:08.560]   It's a little...
[00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:11.360]   Eric Schmidt's getting a little sensitive now that he's a billionaire.
[00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:12.360]   He's acting up.
[00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:13.600]   A lot of people do.
[00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:18.240]   But it seems to me as long as they haven't really messed with CNET's links on Google,
[00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:19.240]   you know, in other words...
[00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:20.240]   Well, that would be bad.
[00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:23.400]   So, this is just a pissing contest.
[00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:24.400]   Who cares?
[00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:27.720]   I mean, the thing about the information that Eric Schmidt's, it's all something that would
[00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:30.000]   be available in any public filings.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   Exactly.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   It was on Google.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   Well, the information is public.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   It's not even that it was that private.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:39.920]   What I've heard from some people who say "work at CNET in certain departments" was that
[00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:45.040]   Google was upset that CNET wrongfully accused them of using desktop search to catalog what
[00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:46.040]   was on people's desktops.
[00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:47.040]   They didn't like that.
[00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:50.560]   They sent it back to their super secret Google servers where all these secret information
[00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:51.560]   is kept.
[00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:52.560]   I see.
[00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:54.720]   I mean, the fundamental question is, and it comes back to an incident we had here on
[00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:59.520]   Twitter last Saturday night, was how exactly do you guarantee privacy?
[00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:02.760]   Not that I would ever whine about somebody revealing something that was public.
[00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:03.760]   Well, the point...
[00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:12.200]   But the point being is, you know, our complete bit to our system has been redirected because
[00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:15.680]   our feed burner system has been redirected because you felt that they revealed information
[00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:16.680]   that shouldn't be public.
[00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:17.680]   Yeah.
[00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:18.680]   They said we had 41,000 subscribers.
[00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:21.960]   I think there's more people in this room.
[00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:26.960]   I think the issue with Google is that they're using their size and power to try to muscle
[00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:27.960]   CNET.
[00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:30.560]   They're trying to send them in there to do saying, "Hey, look, if you mess with us,
[00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:33.960]   meeting other media organizations, if you try to report us in a way we might not like,
[00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:36.960]   we're big enough and important enough that if we don't talk to you, you might care about
[00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:37.960]   it."
[00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:39.840]   Well, that's why I'm surprised John's not leaping to CNET's defense.
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:42.360]   Yeah, this is how the entire music industry is right.
[00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:45.960]   If you work for a music paper, if you don't cover all the horrible little bands that nobody
[00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:49.840]   cares about, especially the ones that are total marketing fabrication, you will not get an
[00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:53.280]   interview with the larger bands, you know, unless you're maybe rolling stone.
[00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:55.880]   I mean, that's just the way it's done in other industries.
[00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:56.880]   Well, there's a precedent.
[00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:59.440]   I mean, you go downstairs and find a Wiley and Sons book.
[00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:01.600]   You know, here's one other thing you have to consider.
[00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:03.240]   CNET's a news outlet.
[00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:08.120]   If they wanted to, which is what I think they should do, if they find this to be a problem,
[00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:10.240]   why don't they go after Google?
[00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:13.160]   Start investigating the company, writing a lot of negative stories.
[00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:14.160]   That always helps.
[00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:17.400]   I mean, there's ways of doing this.
[00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:18.400]   How are the press?
[00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:19.400]   Why are they writing to us?
[00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:21.360]   I'm not working for CNET.
[00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:22.360]   Why should I be defending them?
[00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:25.480]   They can't take care of themselves, a bigger company than I am.
[00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:31.200]   The reason it's came up is the New York Times op-ed pages did, in fact, just publish an
[00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:34.240]   editorial piece saying, "It's shameful what Google's doing."
[00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:35.600]   Oh, it's so shameful.
[00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:36.840]   The New York Times does it.
[00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:37.840]   Who are they kidding?
[00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:38.840]   Do they?
[00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:39.840]   Why don't they do it?
[00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:41.640]   If you don't ask the right questions at a big press conference, they--
[00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:42.640]   That's right.
[00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:43.640]   You never get invited back.
[00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:44.640]   Apple's the same way.
[00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:47.280]   Why do you think I don't get invited to these things?
[00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:51.400]   At least CNET knows why they can't give phone calls back.
[00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:52.400]   True.
[00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:56.880]   Besides that, you can always have a string or go do a story, and then file it with CNET.
[00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:58.280]   You can always circumvent the system.
[00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:01.720]   You don't have to say, "I'm with CNET."
[00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:05.320]   You could be an independent guy, and they can hire freelancers to do this kind of work.
[00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:09.160]   If they want to get a story out of Google, it's not a big deal.
[00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:10.160]   Anyway.
[00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:13.600]   I think that's pretty much says it all.
[00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:16.280]   Anything you are on your mind right now, Kevin Rose?
[00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:17.440]   Lin Spire launches 5.0.
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:19.080]   They're going to give it away.
[00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:22.920]   Now, wasn't that because somebody else-- is it a free spire?
[00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:27.240]   Somebody did this free spire that was a Lin Spire distro that was going to be free.
[00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:28.240]   They've been doing this for a while, though.
[00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:30.840]   They've been giving coupon codes so you can get it for a couple of days.
[00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:32.880]   They're saying just for a few days they're going to be giving it away.
[00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:33.880]   But who cares?
[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:36.760]   I think Lin Spire is the worst Linux operating system I've ever seen.
[00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:39.160]   Somebody sent me an email saying, "Quick, you can get Lin Spire for free."
[00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:40.920]   I was like, "That's terrible."
[00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:41.920]   What do you use?
[00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:42.920]   I get sousa for free.
[00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:46.520]   I would rather prefer using a Linux distro that you don't have to pay for.
[00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:47.520]   Debian?
[00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:48.520]   Debian?
[00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:49.520]   Well, it's based on Debian.
[00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:50.520]   What do you like the best?
[00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:51.520]   Debian.
[00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:52.520]   You do?
[00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:53.520]   Debian is for advanced users.
[00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:55.720]   Well, the package management is pretty much the nice part of it.
[00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:56.720]   All that is wonderful.
[00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:59.120]   It's easy to update applications.
[00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:00.120]   Gen 2 is similar.
[00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:02.000]   It uses the same kind of thing.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.360]   Do you use anything but Windows, Roger?
[00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:07.480]   I use the NOPICS like the STD.
[00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:10.280]   I love those live distros.
[00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:11.280]   They're really cool.
[00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:12.280]   Why is that?
[00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:13.280]   Because you don't want to bother installing it.
[00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:16.280]   I don't want to take up the hard drive on my dedicated...
[00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:20.360]   Because I'm recording and I've got a lot of tracks on hard drive and I don't want to
[00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:21.360]   mess with it.
[00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:22.360]   I'll just get into Linux.
[00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:26.520]   He actually goes on the road with a laptop and does live recordings with these expensive
[00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:27.520]   mic.
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:28.520]   Tell us about this mic.
[00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:29.520]   He's got a mic.
[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:30.520]   This is a Samsung.
[00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:31.920]   It's called a C01U.
[00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:32.920]   Not Samsung.
[00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:33.920]   No.
[00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:35.720]   Samsung like the guy who lost his hair.
[00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:36.720]   Like Samsung.
[00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:37.720]   It's a...
[00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:38.720]   Samsung is a music...
[00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:39.720]   They sell hardware.
[00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:40.720]   Music.
[00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:41.720]   Oh, okay.
[00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:42.720]   Like instruments and stuff like that.
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:43.720]   So they're well known?
[00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:44.720]   Yeah, it's Sam Ash.
[00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:45.880]   Oh, Sam Ash, okay.
[00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:48.080]   And this is their proprietary brand.
[00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:49.080]   And so it's a C01U.
[00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:50.920]   It's a USB studio mic.
[00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:56.320]   I think it's about a 19 millimeter large die-firm condenser mic.
[00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:57.600]   So it'd be very good for voice.
[00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:59.800]   Yeah, it's great for voice and musical instruments.
[00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:00.800]   I feel like...
[00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:02.440]   How much did those go for?
[00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:03.440]   I don't know.
[00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:04.440]   It was...
[00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:05.440]   He was like you, Devorek.
[00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:06.440]   He doesn't buy this stuff.
[00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:08.440]   It was a gimme.
[00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:09.440]   Yeah, it's...
[00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:10.440]   But what's needed to USB?
[00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:11.440]   Yes.
[00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:12.440]   At least I have a ballpark figure.
[00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:15.960]   I think it's probably like under 200 bucks.
[00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:16.960]   Really?
[00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:17.960]   Yeah, it's like 199 something.
[00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:18.960]   What's the model again?
[00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:19.960]   It's a C01U.
[00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:23.680]   I think a lot of podcasters that would be probably a very good one.
[00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:24.680]   Oh, they need it.
[00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:25.680]   It's ideal for podcasters.
[00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:28.440]   Most podcasters do a crappy job because they're audio.
[00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:30.000]   They don't have good microphones.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   But it's a simple...
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   It's a simple...
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   It's a...
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   You beat me.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   Samson C01U.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   80 bucks.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   It's 80 bucks.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   It's about 80 bucks.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   Cool.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   Cool.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   That's great.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   Now, does it have a mount?
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.880]   I mean, it looks like the USB is plugging into the bottom.
[00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:46.720]   Yeah, there's a mount here that's on screws and there's a...
[00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:48.440]   So you could put it on a microphone stand.
[00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:49.520]   It goes on a mic stand, right?
[00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:50.520]   I just didn't bring the mic in.
[00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:51.520]   Right.
[00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:54.240]   We should actually, for all this publicity, we should be getting a bunch of free mics
[00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:55.240]   for all the Twitcasters here.
[00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:56.480]   I think it'd be a good thing.
[00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:57.480]   I think so.
[00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:58.480]   Yeah, now that I've spent...
[00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:00.120]   I'll look into it.
[00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:01.120]   I just...
[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:06.000]   You know, I mean, we just bought one, two, three, four, five Sennheiser headset mics.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   Yeah.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   And so we don't need them now.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   But thanks.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   Anyway, right.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.400]   But this could be handy for others.
[00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:12.400]   Yeah, we could use it.
[00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:16.560]   And also, I just wanted to say I'm recording this on Audacity, which is a cross-platform
[00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:18.800]   free multi-track program.
[00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:19.800]   It's a wonderful...
[00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:20.800]   We were talking...
[00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:26.360]   Because I use right now what I'm recording this on, for instance, is Auditions from Adobe,
[00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:29.320]   which is a proprietary $300 program for Windows-only.
[00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:32.000]   Audacity is Windows, Mac, Linux, and it's absolutely free.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   It's great.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   You find them comparable?
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.720]   Well, no, I think there are probably more features on Adobe Audition or Pro Tools or
[00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:41.520]   the ones that cost hundreds of dollars.
[00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:43.120]   But for the price, you can't beat this.
[00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:44.120]   I mean, it's amazing.
[00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:47.200]   And it's also great if you want to record something on Mac and give it to somebody on
[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:49.200]   Linux or a Windows phone.
[00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:53.480]   You said that you recorded an album on Adobe Audition in a laptop?
[00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:54.480]   I did.
[00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:57.600]   Dell gave me a complimentary laptop to play with.
[00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:59.240]   An 8,200 in-spron.
[00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:04.600]   And I used Adobe Audition to record my last CD, which is called Limited Edition, and it's
[00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:06.800]   available on Amazon.com.
[00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:10.200]   Are you not working for record companies anymore?
[00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:11.200]   You're doing your own thing.
[00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:12.200]   No, I became a record company.
[00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:17.040]   I bought a book on how to become a record company, and it was pretty simple.
[00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:20.080]   Because basically, when you have a record company, the only thing they're good for
[00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:21.800]   is promotion, and they are great at that.
[00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:23.000]   They're wonderful for promotion.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.520]   They can get you on Leno and Letterman and all that.
[00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:27.160]   But they take all the money.
[00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:28.160]   Yes.
[00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:29.160]   So you get the publicity and they get the money.
[00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:30.160]   It's nothing else.
[00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:31.160]   I'd rather have the money.
[00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:32.160]   And I'd have it.
[00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:33.160]   He gets to screw himself.
[00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:34.160]   Yeah.
[00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:35.160]   Right.
[00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:36.160]   And he can't sell it to dinner.
[00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:37.160]   Right.
[00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:38.160]   And charge it to myself.
[00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:41.400]   Yeah, can Leno and I go out to dinner and go, "The record company's paying for this.
[00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:42.400]   Isn't it great?"
[00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:44.880]   I do think more artists will kind of move in this direction.
[00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:45.880]   I do.
[00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:49.680]   Now that the equipment is getting affordable for everybody, I mean, anybody can buy a
[00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:53.520]   Pro Tools or Adobe Audition set up and record an album now.
[00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:57.160]   And you don't need to see the thing was before you had to sell your soul to the company
[00:20:57.160 --> 00:21:01.240]   store to get the money to record because it cost a thousand bucks a day to do it.
[00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:02.840]   Now it costs nothing a day.
[00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:05.240]   So levels of playing field for artists.
[00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:06.240]   It's annoying.
[00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:07.440]   Nor do you need them for distribution anymore.
[00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:08.440]   Not really.
[00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:10.440]   No, because, right, you've got Amazon.com.
[00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:13.720]   I mean, that's a perfect international distribution.
[00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:16.960]   How hard is it to get yourself on iTunes or Napster services?
[00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:24.160]   I signed with, I'm not sure what the threshold is, but it was easy for me to get into it.
[00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:28.560]   I got like a one sort of a one stop thing that got me on iTunes and all the other ones
[00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:29.560]   E music.
[00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:33.720]   So it helps to be a brand name artist.
[00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:35.360]   It helps if you got some name recognition.
[00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:37.920]   I'm not sure how it would be for just, you know, from an app.
[00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:40.200]   Can you use the third party service?
[00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:41.200]   For what?
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:45.000]   To get on to iTunes or did you deal with Apple directly?
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   I did not go to Apple directly.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.760]   I went with E music first.
[00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:49.760]   E music is great.
[00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:50.760]   Are they still around?
[00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:51.760]   Do they?
[00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:52.760]   Yeah, I believe so.
[00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:53.760]   Yeah.
[00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:54.760]   I mean, that's a neat idea.
[00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:58.320]   And that's what Michael Rogers did before Lenspire was MP3.com.
[00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:01.120]   I mean, all of those, I mean, that's what we need.
[00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:03.520]   Yeah, MP3.com is part of CNET now.
[00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:08.920]   E music is free and it's not free, but it's actually a deal for music.
[00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:09.920]   Yeah.
[00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:13.000]   Consistent rumors that at some point Apple is going to do this with iTunes.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.280]   They're going to make some channel in GarageBand via push a button and you sell your stuff
[00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:18.280]   on iTunes.
[00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:19.280]   That'd be cool.
[00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:20.280]   Yeah.
[00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:21.280]   Wow.
[00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:22.280]   Would that be the kind of thing?
[00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:23.280]   You wouldn't probably use something you would have.
[00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:25.680]   Well, I've already gone to another level where we sent it to a pressing plant.
[00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:26.680]   You've got actual CDs.
[00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:29.280]   Real CDs and sell them at gigs and online.
[00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:30.280]   Right.
[00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:31.880]   I'm not sure how long people are going to want them.
[00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:34.840]   Although this next project we're doing is something that people will want because they've
[00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:40.840]   got a 40 page color booklet and a lot of information that you can't really get by downloading.
[00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:42.120]   That's the one thing I miss.
[00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:43.920]   I used to sit and we would, you know, leave you.
[00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:44.920]   Yeah, look at the album covers.
[00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:45.920]   Look at the album cover.
[00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:48.640]   I have one of your albums you have covered kindly autographed on the wall.
[00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:49.640]   Yeah.
[00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:50.640]   Yeah, John brought it back for you and that was really great.
[00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:51.640]   Right.
[00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:55.320]   I saw it on, actually you had a net cam in your office at one time.
[00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:56.320]   I saw it on the wall.
[00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:57.320]   That's pretty cool.
[00:22:57.320 --> 00:23:01.360]   Well, I think it's pretty cool too.
[00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:05.080]   So you think that the days of the record companies are numbered or do you think that
[00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:06.080]   they still have a place?
[00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:10.760]   Well, they still have a place but their place is not what it used to be because they can't
[00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:16.560]   really own you as easily because artists can afford to record their own stuff now and
[00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:17.560]   distribute it.
[00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:19.560]   But they're still a place for them.
[00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:23.960]   A lot of people, I know a kid who just signed with a record label and he's got a band and
[00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:25.440]   he's going to do that.
[00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:27.200]   Did you make money off the old records?
[00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:30.800]   You know, the deals back in the 60s were really bad.
[00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:38.200]   I think it's, for my personal take on a birds album is something like 0.003 cents.
[00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:39.200]   Sounds like my book deals.
[00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:40.200]   For album, right.
[00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:42.840]   But I have to say, and I can't bash the record company.
[00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:43.840]   That's not a good book.
[00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:45.400]   The difference is Roger actually wrote the music.
[00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:50.200]   But we made subsequent deals and they've done a lot of reissues.
[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:51.520]   So I can't bash the record companies.
[00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:52.520]   They do pay royalties.
[00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:53.520]   Subsequently.
[00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:56.560]   You get a fat ass cap check every month, don't you?
[00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:57.560]   I'm DMI.
[00:23:57.560 --> 00:23:58.560]   Camilla's ass cap.
[00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:00.560]   You just wanted to say fat ass cap.
[00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:01.560]   Don't.
[00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:02.560]   Yeah, you just like that, right?
[00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:03.560]   Yeah.
[00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:04.560]   Don't do that.
[00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:05.560]   But you do get a fat check.
[00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:06.560]   BMI, doesn't it?
[00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:07.560]   BMI is good.
[00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:08.560]   Yeah.
[00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:09.560]   BMI is good.
[00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:10.560]   Yeah.
[00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:11.560]   I've been trying to get for years trying to find what this check amount is.
[00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:12.560]   He's trying to find out what I'm worth for years.
[00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:14.840]   I've never been able to get that.
[00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:15.840]   I don't know.
[00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:19.440]   Because I think all these guys make BMI or ass cap.
[00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:22.000]   What you said, ass cap doesn't give you a royalty.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   I'm not with ass cap.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.720]   Camilla's with ass cap and I'm with BMI and we write songs together, my wife.
[00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:27.720]   Yeah, I know.
[00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:30.720]   Sometimes she gets more than I do on the same song, which I can't figure out.
[00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:31.920]   But she comes from ass cap.
[00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:32.920]   Yeah.
[00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:33.920]   She gets more on ass cap than I get on BMI.
[00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:34.920]   That's cool.
[00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:36.920]   But we told that to BMI and then I got a big fat check from them.
[00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:37.920]   So I don't know.
[00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:39.920]   In other words, they're just making this up as they call along.
[00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:41.920]   It's like, well, give it more.
[00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:47.880]   For people out there who want to know, artists are paid based on radio play and a bunch of
[00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:49.360]   others think that radio's had played.
[00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:51.360]   But it's important to pay into artists.
[00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:53.360]   But they're all publishing rights.
[00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:57.080]   And that's kind of a big, because I once we had the...
[00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:58.080]   Frank Sinatra.
[00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:02.080]   So when you're a little different, free music guy in the radio, you are...
[00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:03.480]   Somebody's paying...
[00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:05.600]   The money gets split out.
[00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:06.600]   But not to the performer.
[00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:07.600]   The serious way.
[00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:08.600]   Not to the performer.
[00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:09.600]   That's mysterious.
[00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:10.920]   That's why I've been trying to get this number for him.
[00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:11.920]   Oh, yeah, that's why.
[00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:12.920]   No, it is why.
[00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:13.920]   I don't...
[00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:15.400]   So Frank Sinatra never made any royalty.
[00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:19.720]   Well, all his life, he tried to get performance royalties and he never pulled it off.
[00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:20.720]   No kidding.
[00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:21.720]   That's kind of something.
[00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:23.200]   I'm sure he made money, but he didn't make it that way.
[00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:27.840]   I remember we had the captain of the captain at Zneel on the screensavers once.
[00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:30.040]   That was the best we could aspire to now that we've met you.
[00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:31.560]   I think we don't have to go that way.
[00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:33.480]   But I asked him...
[00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:36.560]   I asked him, "Well, you mind people stealing your music?
[00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:37.560]   I couldn't care less.
[00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:39.200]   Neil Sedaka gets all the money anyway, right?
[00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:40.200]   So it doesn't cost...
[00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:41.200]   Yeah, Gerald Dragon, right.
[00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:42.200]   Gerald Dragon.
[00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:43.200]   You know, he's a producer now.
[00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:44.200]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:45.200]   Yeah, so that's the thing.
[00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:46.920]   I went to the Senate and they asked me about MP3s.
[00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:49.560]   It was the Senate Judiciary Committee.
[00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:50.840]   They said, "Is there an upside to downloading?"
[00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:53.760]   I said, "Downloading is not bad for artists.
[00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:54.760]   It's bad for record companies.
[00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:56.760]   You know, they have no problem with it."
[00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:58.640]   But they tried to pass the whole thing.
[00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:00.640]   They tried to make it look like you're hurting the artists.
[00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:01.920]   Yeah, that's what bugged me.
[00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:04.480]   They were saying the poor artist isn't getting the royalties.
[00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:05.640]   They were never getting the royalties.
[00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:06.640]   So it was about...
[00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:08.880]   I couldn't be screw the artist if you screw them.
[00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:09.880]   Yeah, right.
[00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:10.880]   We're busy screwing the artist.
[00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:13.040]   Stop getting in their way.
[00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:14.040]   Would you tell people who...
[00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:18.560]   I mean, there are a lot of people listening who download music that they shouldn't download
[00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:19.560]   from illegal...
[00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:25.880]   Well, you know, I took that side and I got sued by somebody for, you know, like saying that,
[00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:27.040]   like it's called to download.
[00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:28.800]   So I really, you know, have to be careful.
[00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:29.800]   Let's not say anything.
[00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:31.240]   Yeah, we don't want to get sued.
[00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:33.400]   But personally, it doesn't hurt me.
[00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:34.400]   Right.
[00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:35.400]   Yeah.
[00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:36.400]   Or Darryl Dragon.
[00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:37.400]   Yeah.
[00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:38.400]   Yeah.
[00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:39.400]   So there's two.
[00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:40.400]   But there's a lot of people like Janice and who have been very outspoken.
[00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:41.400]   She's on the side of that.
[00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:42.400]   Yeah.
[00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:43.400]   And quite a few other artists.
[00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:44.400]   Yeah.
[00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:46.360]   Well, sitting next to me was Lars from...
[00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:47.360]   Lars Ulrich.
[00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:48.360]   Yeah, from his other side.
[00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:49.360]   I came to someone the other side.
[00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:50.360]   I don't think he got it.
[00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:51.360]   I just don't think he got it.
[00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:52.360]   I agree with that.
[00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:53.360]   I don't think he did either.
[00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:54.360]   Yeah.
[00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:56.360]   And the other thing is, you know, these guys still can't face the reality that during
[00:26:56.360 --> 00:27:00.680]   the heyday of Napster, the record sales were actually increasing because I still believe
[00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:01.680]   to this...
[00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:04.600]   I'll never not believe this because I've seen it happen to me.
[00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:08.200]   When you were on Napster, you could see you'd find some guy who had a song that you wanted
[00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:12.280]   and then you'd check out his collection and you'd see he has your taste and then you'd
[00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:13.640]   see, "What's this?
[00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:15.120]   I've never heard of this group."
[00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:17.480]   You'd check it out and you'd say, "Wow, these guys are great."
[00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:24.680]   And you'd go buy the album or my wife, for example, never doesn't buy CDs.
[00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:28.880]   And then it seems to me that the latest thing they want to do is kill off iTunes by...
[00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:32.400]   These guys are now dicking with Apple to tell them, "Well, maybe you have a variable
[00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:33.400]   rate structure.
[00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:35.080]   Let's charge a buck and a half.
[00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:36.920]   Some of the newer songs should be more expensive.
[00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:40.120]   I'm thinking the newer songs should be more than the old songs should be more expensive.
[00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:42.080]   The new song they should be pushing them out there.
[00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:46.400]   Yeah, actually, I don't mind if they charge a buck 50 for Britney Spears as long as I
[00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:47.400]   can get...
[00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:48.400]   Seriously, as long as I can get...
[00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:49.400]   And that actually makes...
[00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:50.960]   Maybe that structure does make some sense.
[00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:51.960]   It makes no sense.
[00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:54.000]   Well, if it makes sense for this record company, let them have it.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.440]   It's not making screw Apple out of this lucrative...
[00:27:56.440 --> 00:28:00.560]   But if I can buy the temptations for 30 cents a record, I don't care that I can't buy
[00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:01.560]   Britney Spears for a buck...
[00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:03.520]   It'll cost me a buck 50.
[00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:07.560]   Do you buy that Apple iTunes is losing money on selling music?
[00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:08.560]   There's a lot of...
[00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:09.560]   Actually, there's a lot of analysts.
[00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:10.800]   You know why I buy it?
[00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:15.400]   And actually, I won't say where I got this from, but it's somebody we know.
[00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:19.280]   The problem that people don't think about is, yeah, they get the 60/30 split, right?
[00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:20.280]   But it's not even that.
[00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:21.280]   The bandwidth.
[00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:24.840]   They pay a lot of money to Akamai for the download bandwidth.
[00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:28.040]   There's a hidden cause that nobody takes into account.
[00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:29.520]   Right, right.
[00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:34.160]   I just did a call for PC Magazine, I should mention, where I discussed this Apple iTunes
[00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:36.080]   RIAA issue.
[00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:40.920]   And I believe that the RIAA started to screw with Apple, not because of the money or anything
[00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:41.920]   else.
[00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:45.240]   I think it has to do with the fact that all of a sudden, because when they began iTunes,
[00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:46.240]   it was like, "Oh, there's a lark.
[00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:49.040]   All Apple's going to sell stuff on who cares?"
[00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:51.560]   And there's nothing else we'll get a check in the mail.
[00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:53.480]   Then they started to realize that, "Hey, wait a minute.
[00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:56.880]   There's an awful lot of songs going through this Apple system.
[00:28:56.880 --> 00:29:02.840]   And now we have a third party that we don't control accounting for numbers.
[00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:06.800]   They can bring out numbers and say, "Well, this is a group sold this many."
[00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:07.800]   Oh, interesting.
[00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:08.800]   So that many.
[00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:12.160]   And meanwhile, the groups are getting screwed out of their royalties by these crazy bookkeeping
[00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:16.160]   schemes that both publishing companies and record companies employ to make it look like
[00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:17.160]   you're not making any money.
[00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:18.160]   Yeah, they got some tricks.
[00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:19.760]   They got all kinds of cool tricks.
[00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:24.120]   But now with third parties with independent numbers that can be just kicked out of a
[00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:27.080]   computer like that, their record companies are going, "Oh my God, we're going to be
[00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:28.400]   found out.
[00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:30.480]   We've got to kill this now."
[00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:34.880]   Didn't Sony just get busted for Paola, like a month ago?
[00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:36.040]   Oh, they got the old scumies.
[00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:37.040]   Yeah.
[00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:38.040]   Yeah, there was a big process.
[00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:40.640]   But they say that hasn't happened since the '50s.
[00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:41.640]   Apparently it's happening.
[00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:42.640]   Yeah, it's probably happened.
[00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:45.240]   They haven't been busted since the '50s.
[00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:46.240]   Yeah.
[00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:48.240]   Big record companies come to me all the time saying, "Would you play our songs on Twitter?"
[00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:52.120]   But I always say, "No, not one, not yet anyway."
[00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:55.800]   You guys have any other stories you're excited about?
[00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:57.400]   All the old guys are on this side of the table.
[00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:58.400]   We should talk to young guys.
[00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:02.360]   Yeah, sitting here in the Apple store, apparently a couple of days ago, I wasn't privy to a
[00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:05.640]   couple of days ago, you could buy a Mac Mini and try it out for about half a day.
[00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:06.640]   What happened to that?
[00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:11.600]   The one day Mac Mini test drive, they pulled out the plug in 24 hours.
[00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:15.240]   Is it because too many people were doing it or because they were worried that I'm guessing
[00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:16.440]   it's because too many people were doing it?
[00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:17.440]   That's what I was thinking.
[00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:20.240]   And maybe they couldn't keep up or is it because they're not-
[00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:24.760]   No, I customarily say, "Come in, I get this, I come in, all the Mac Mini's have been
[00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:25.760]   coming for.
[00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:26.760]   They're all gone."
[00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:30.800]   I'd be annoyed and maybe they might lose a sale or something.
[00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:31.800]   I could see where you have to go.
[00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:32.800]   Well, raise this a couple of questions.
[00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:33.800]   First of all, why they did it?
[00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:37.720]   Are Mini sales slowing down and they feel like they needed a problem?
[00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:38.720]   Or what?
[00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:41.040]   Well, first, why did they think of the idea?
[00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:44.480]   I think there's a lot of people that are sitting there, they have the extra money.
[00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:46.400]   They're not sure if they quite want to buy it.
[00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:48.000]   When you throw out the 30-day return, why not?
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.960]   It's a good promotion because how many people are ever going to return?
[00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:51.960]   Nobody returns to the same.
[00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:52.960]   It's a cool box.
[00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:53.960]   It's really cool.
[00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:55.600]   It's a sensible promotion.
[00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:56.600]   People have been doing this for years.
[00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:58.160]   You have free money back guarantee.
[00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:00.560]   Nobody ever takes a money back guarantee.
[00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:02.760]   So it just gives you the security, "Well, I'll buy it."
[00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:04.440]   If I don't like it, at least I can always take it back.
[00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:05.920]   Very few people, I'm sure do.
[00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:07.960]   Do you think it was too soon to have abuse?
[00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:09.200]   It couldn't have been that somebody was abusing.
[00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:10.200]   It was only 24 hours.
[00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:11.200]   It got dug.
[00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:12.200]   It got dug.
[00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:13.200]   That's what happened.
[00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:15.840]   AJ says it got dug.
[00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:16.840]   It did get dug.
[00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:17.840]   Yeah, it was on the homepage.
[00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:18.840]   A lot of people were buying them.
[00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:19.840]   Do you think so?
[00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:22.960]   Well, I mean, not all from dig, but there was definitely a lot of interest I saw.
[00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:24.920]   It was picked up all over the place, all these different blogs.
[00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:26.760]   I mean, a ton of people were hitting that site.
[00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:28.840]   I'm sure buying the minis.
[00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:30.400]   It's not going to be a closeout item though, is it?
[00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:31.400]   Yeah.
[00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:33.360]   Where they're just trying to get rid of them for a new item that's going to go under.
[00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:34.360]   Well, I wonder.
[00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:37.760]   Well, look, they said they were going to have the Intel minis.
[00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:42.160]   It would be the first, and they would have them by mid-2006.
[00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:47.320]   My prediction is they'll have it by January for Macworld Expo and surprise everybody, right?
[00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:48.880]   Is that going to be 64-bit?
[00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:49.880]   Well, that's the problem.
[00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:50.880]   It's 32-bit.
[00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:54.320]   They're moving backwards, but not that anybody needed 64-bit particularly, but...
[00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:56.680]   Yeah, should be a centrino processor on that.
[00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:58.200]   That would be a good choice for that, wouldn't it?
[00:31:58.200 --> 00:31:59.200]   It's a low-power centrino.
[00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:01.560]   Yeah, because it's very low heat.
[00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:03.480]   Is that a choice for them?
[00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:04.480]   They don't need the Yona.
[00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:05.480]   They don't need anything more.
[00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:06.480]   Well, they weren't.
[00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:07.480]   No.
[00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:08.480]   Not Celeron, centrino.
[00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:09.480]   No, centrino.
[00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:10.480]   That's a life-fight.
[00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:11.480]   Yeah, that's why it backed it.
[00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:15.560]   No, they got a cut and just a closed deal with Broadcom.
[00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:16.960]   They're not going to switch to it.
[00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:17.960]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:18.960]   It wouldn't be centrino.
[00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:19.960]   You're right.
[00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:20.960]   It would be a Celeron.
[00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:21.960]   It would be a penny a month.
[00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:22.960]   It would be a penny a month.
[00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:23.960]   Yeah.
[00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:24.960]   Yeah.
[00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:25.960]   Well, that would be a good product.
[00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:26.960]   I would buy that.
[00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:27.960]   Sure.
[00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:28.960]   So you think that that's what happened?
[00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:29.960]   Well, no, because they want to get these...
[00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:30.960]   Maybe they cleared them all out already.
[00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:31.960]   Yeah, maybe they're done.
[00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:32.960]   Maybe they're done?
[00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:33.960]   Maybe they're done.
[00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:35.960]   I think they've got McMendys.
[00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:36.960]   Okay, someone run downstairs.
[00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:38.160]   Bring us all the McMendys.
[00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:40.400]   Are you out of back minis downstairs?
[00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:41.440]   They've got McMendys down here.
[00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:44.280]   So I guess that throws that one at the door.
[00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:47.320]   Well, they're going to know in 30 days what percentage of the people that decided to do
[00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:49.120]   the trial were they got it at the front.
[00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:50.120]   No, but he returns those.
[00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:51.120]   How many?
[00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:52.120]   I mean, that's the best majority of them.
[00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:54.960]   You think the only time people return them is where they go to Best Buy and they buy a
[00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:55.960]   product and they...
[00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:59.080]   You know, it's like I used to know somebody who would buy shoes at Nordstrom and then
[00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:02.120]   she'd tape the bottom of them so they wouldn't get dirty and then bring them back after the
[00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:04.120]   prom the next day.
[00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:05.600]   I mean, there are people who do that with Best Buy, right?
[00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:06.600]   They buy a product.
[00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:07.600]   I do that.
[00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:11.000]   Buy a DV camera and shoot the wedding and bring it back.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.240]   Yeah, there are a lot of TVs that are right before the Super Bowl.
[00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:14.240]   It works.
[00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:15.240]   Why not return right now?
[00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:16.240]   But nobody would do that with a mini.
[00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:18.880]   I mean, there's no reason you need a mini for, you know, a couple of weeks.
[00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:21.400]   So it sounds like a good way to sell McMendys then.
[00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:22.400]   Well, that's what I'm thinking.
[00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:23.400]   I think it's a good promotion.
[00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:24.400]   So why'd they kill it?
[00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:26.400]   Tell us what the most affordable Mac there is.
[00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:28.600]   So you're given a really easy way to try it out.
[00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:29.600]   That'll make sense.
[00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:33.160]   For promotion, but the reason they probably killed it was just simply to a line of man.
[00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:37.120]   And like John mentioned, just simply having irate customers show up and look at the deal
[00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:38.120]   and it's not there.
[00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:39.480]   But, no, of course you get it here.
[00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:40.480]   It's kind of a weird thing.
[00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:44.360]   You don't expect a big retailer like Apple to do something like that.
[00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:46.520]   Maybe Steve didn't sign off before it went live.
[00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:50.520]   I keep expecting Steve to show up, you know, like he's going to kind of say what are you
[00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:51.520]   doing here.
[00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:53.280]   Oh, just peeked around the corner.
[00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:55.680]   Oh my God, there's media.
[00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:56.680]   All right.
[00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:57.680]   Well, that's it.
[00:33:57.680 --> 00:33:58.680]   Okay.
[00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:00.480]   So, I'm going to talk about the issues you guys are.
[00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:03.240]   Text America has a couple of really cool sites about Katrina.
[00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:05.560]   Let's talk about Katrina a little bit.
[00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:06.560]   Yeah.
[00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:09.840]   They came out with safecutrina.com and missingcutrina.com on Text America.
[00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:14.320]   And they actually have people down there taking pictures with cell phones and uploading them.
[00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:15.880]   They actually go to where there's internet connectivity.
[00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:19.640]   I went right away to Text America because I thought there'll be a lot of pictures, but
[00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:21.040]   then I realized there's no cell signals.
[00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:22.040]   How are they getting these signals?
[00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:25.800]   Well, they have actually, I talked to Chris who's the founder of Text America today.
[00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:29.680]   And he said that they have 400 pictures that they've taken of people that are safe and
[00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:30.680]   they're going to be posting them.
[00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:33.600]   They're actually driving to where there's internet connectivity in the network in the
[00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:34.600]   pictures.
[00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:38.160]   Team Mobile has offered free Wi-Fi if you can get, but there's no power.
[00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:40.720]   They're saying now two months before the powers are stored in New Orleans.
[00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:41.720]   Two months.
[00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:42.720]   Yeah.
[00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:43.720]   80 days before it's pumped out.
[00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:47.160]   And who was the person who sent out the press release about Wi-Max being a way to save
[00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:48.160]   people?
[00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:49.160]   Somebody did that.
[00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:50.800]   Well, somebody sent out a new start.
[00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:51.800]   We could go and get you a signal.
[00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:54.680]   If there was Wi-Max people would have internet in New Orleans.
[00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:56.560]   At least those who haven't lost their battery yet.
[00:34:56.560 --> 00:34:57.560]   Well, yeah.
[00:34:57.560 --> 00:35:02.480]   And that's like the person who's saying Wi-Max is going to make internet all across Africa.
[00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:04.600]   And it's like, well, we need electricity first in computers.
[00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:05.600]   More amsters.
[00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:06.600]   Yeah.
[00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:07.600]   And for some reason.
[00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:08.600]   Yeah.
[00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:14.120]   So I know we have a lot of listeners, by the way, in that area, in the whole Gulf area.
[00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:17.840]   And so we, our prayers and thoughts go out to you if you're listening at all.
[00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:21.600]   I mean, tons of people listening down there.
[00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:24.200]   It was really kind of neat to see how quickly the net responded.
[00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:25.480]   I was looking at the Red Cross page.
[00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:27.440]   Every time you went back, it'd be another $5 million.
[00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:29.200]   They're well- L - Yeah, they're getting a lot of money.
[00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:31.440]   But, you know, FEMA wouldn't even let them into New Orleans.
[00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:32.440]   That's what I heard.
[00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:33.440]   Now, what's the story there?
[00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:34.440]   It's on the Red Cross dot org site.
[00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:35.440]   They couldn't get in.
[00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:37.440]   Apparently, the FEMA wouldn't let the Red Cross in.
[00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:40.600]   FEMA wouldn't let the - there's a bunch of - Maybe that was to protect them.
[00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:41.600]   Oh, yeah.
[00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:45.040]   And there's a bunch of airboat guys that wanted to get in to save people off the roofs.
[00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:48.040]   And there were people on regular boats wanted to save people.
[00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:49.520]   And they were called renegade boaters.
[00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:50.520]   They didn't want them.
[00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:53.240]   No, it's all done by Homeland Security because these were all security issues.
[00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:56.040]   But if there's guys running around with guns, shoot at people.
[00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:57.040]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:35:57.040 --> 00:35:58.040]   Yeah, there is guys running around with guns.
[00:35:58.040 --> 00:36:02.000]   But it was three days before Katrina - excuse me - before FEMA showed up in Manhattan.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   Yeah.
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.440]   When the trade centers didn't count.
[00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:05.440]   72 plus hours.
[00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:06.440]   FEMA's broken.
[00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:08.240]   FEMA may be broken.
[00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:09.240]   FEMA may be broken.
[00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:11.880]   But the point is, it wasn't for a civilian response after -
[00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:12.880]   My 11th.
[00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:13.880]   After 9/11.
[00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:15.880]   Things would have been a lot nastier than they were.
[00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:16.880]   Yeah.
[00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:19.160]   You know, and the idea - yeah, it's a horrible and it's scary.
[00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:22.680]   And people are behaving in unconscionable manner down there.
[00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:24.600]   But the flip side is like, "Why are you preventing us?"
[00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:25.600]   You know what I mean?
[00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:26.600]   It's like, "I get it.
[00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:27.600]   You want it nice.
[00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:28.600]   You want it organized.
[00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:29.600]   You want it check boxes.
[00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:30.600]   You want your side.
[00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:31.600]   Yeah, it's a big brother phenomenon.
[00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:32.600]   They won't let people help themselves.
[00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:34.600]   I mean, I've had - I was blogging a lot of this stuff.
[00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:35.840]   Isn't that what George Bush is all about?
[00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:37.840]   I don't want to get too political.
[00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:42.160]   But there's an issue here and it has to be resolved.
[00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:44.840]   And the thing is, I think there's going to be a lot of moaning and groaning over the
[00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:46.000]   next few months.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   Very dramatic blog.
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   Did you see this?
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:51.400]   I mean, the fact that the - Conda Lisa Rice was shopping for shoes two days after the
[00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:53.400]   hurricane hit is ridiculous.
[00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:54.400]   And she was taking Rouser.
[00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:59.880]   They had the Rouser from the shoe store because some woman apparently came out and started
[00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:02.720]   berating her for being a new - you know about this?
[00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:05.040]   Yeah, she was in New York the whole most of the time.
[00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:09.880]   So, berated her and apparently the store, secret service got freaked out and they whisked
[00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:12.720]   her back to Washington because everyone was like yelling at the woman.
[00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:19.680]   Did you read the - there was an amazing blog from Network Infer - a center - it was
[00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:21.680]   direct-neck down there in the warlands.
[00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:22.680]   Right, they're down there.
[00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:23.680]   They had amazing pictures.
[00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:25.680]   They had their own generator.
[00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:27.960]   And they're talking - the trucks are coming with more fuel.
[00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:28.960]   We hope we don't run out of fuel.
[00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:29.960]   Well, there's a live cam.
[00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:30.960]   It's amazing.
[00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:31.960]   You could watch it.
[00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:33.960]   In fact, there's a building that caught on fire a couple of days ago and they had it
[00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:35.760]   on the cam and it's burning.
[00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:36.760]   Yeah.
[00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:37.760]   Yeah.
[00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:39.120]   Well, I mean, there's an example of citizen journalism.
[00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:43.440]   I mean, this - long before the mainstream media were able to cover this story and before
[00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:47.480]   anybody was in there to rescue, we were seeing what was going on from blogs and people
[00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:49.880]   who were there and this Tex-America thing is a good example.
[00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:51.320]   And it is really quite amazing.
[00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:55.280]   You know, I was never a big fan of the idea that bloggers are going to be the new journalists
[00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:56.280]   of any sort.
[00:37:56.280 --> 00:38:00.040]   I'm still not completely convinced, but I have to say they've done a much better job
[00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:01.040]   than the general media.
[00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:04.920]   And you do have to kind of edit it yourself because there's guys that are just full of
[00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:05.920]   crap on there.
[00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:08.000]   They're not - I don't think journalists is the right word.
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.280]   It's covering the story.
[00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:14.280]   It's something that's there and recording what they see and talking about.
[00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:15.280]   There's storytellers.
[00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:16.280]   Yeah.
[00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:18.080]   And it's participatory journalism.
[00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:21.720]   It's people who are part of the story telling the story.
[00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:25.520]   And that's fine for journalists then to come in and make sense of it or analyze it if they
[00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:26.840]   do a decent job of it.
[00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:31.040]   But the fact is that the primary sources now are so much better than they used to be.
[00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:32.400]   I mean, you're really seeing stuff.
[00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:33.400]   And they're faster.
[00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:34.400]   Yeah, instantly.
[00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:35.400]   Yeah.
[00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:36.400]   I think it's just fascinating.
[00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:37.400]   Like we got this guy here.
[00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:39.400]   We're recording on that right now.
[00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:40.400]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:41.400]   Exactly.
[00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:42.400]   I mean, there were a lot of people.
[00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:44.600]   Orak just said that Rice was in the shoe store.
[00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:47.760]   You believe this left way, right way, left way, left way, whatever.
[00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:49.320]   Well, that is one of the scary things.
[00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:54.480]   And we've seen that happen too, where there's this kind of wave of public opinion that's
[00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:58.120]   influenced by completely fallacious blogs.
[00:38:58.120 --> 00:38:59.120]   And that's another problem.
[00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:00.120]   That's a whole other issue.
[00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:02.440]   But I think people are going to get smarter about what they believe.
[00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:03.440]   I don't think so.
[00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:04.760]   You don't think so?
[00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:06.320]   No evidence.
[00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:10.720]   There's no evidence that people are getting smarter.
[00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:12.160]   They're actually talking about Katrina.
[00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:16.800]   Who was it that was telling me that their company is going to do-- come on over here.
[00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:21.280]   In fact, let me get the handheld mic.
[00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:23.640]   We all know Scott very well from reseller ratings.com.
[00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:24.640]   Hey, Scott, how you doing?
[00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:25.640]   Hey, great.
[00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:27.040]   Oh, let me-- I have to turn you up.
[00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:28.040]   I forgot.
[00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:29.040]   I don't have a rave on here anymore.
[00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:30.040]   Hear me now?
[00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:31.040]   Yeah.
[00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:32.040]   Okay.
[00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:33.040]   Great.
[00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:36.000]   So reseller ratings.com, great site, where you guys publish ratings of companies that
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   sell stuff online.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:40.760]   Yeah, you can go to our site and read reviews of merchants before you buy online and compare
[00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:41.760]   prices.
[00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:42.760]   What we're doing for Katrina?
[00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:46.160]   So what we're doing is we're matching donations to the Red Cross up to $10,000.
[00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:47.160]   That's great.
[00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:49.640]   So we're trying to raise a total of $20,000.
[00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:50.640]   Reseller ratings.com.
[00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:53.760]   Yeah, just go to our home page and click on the banner there and there'll be instructions.
[00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:56.240]   It's really easy to just donate forward your receipt to us.
[00:39:56.240 --> 00:39:57.240]   Nice to go.
[00:39:57.240 --> 00:39:58.240]   That's true.
[00:39:58.240 --> 00:39:59.240]   You're seeing a lot of companies doing that, doing matching donations.
[00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:02.040]   In fact, if you're going to do a donation, you should probably check to see if your company
[00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:03.040]   is doing matching.
[00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:06.960]   Do you see Clorox is giving a buck for everybody who goes to the Clorox site and clicks there
[00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:08.360]   some new detergent or something.
[00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:09.960]   You click there and give it away a buck.
[00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:10.960]   That's pretty cool.
[00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:12.560]   You might as well.
[00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:13.760]   How are things going on reseller ratings?
[00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:14.760]   Again, really good.
[00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:18.880]   We're focusing more on the fraud, preventing fraudulent reviews and working on the shopping
[00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:20.800]   engine and deals.
[00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:22.200]   So it's good to see you again.
[00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:23.200]   Thanks for coming by.
[00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:24.200]   Good to see you guys.
[00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:25.200]   Your success out here.
[00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:26.200]   It's a great show.
[00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:27.200]   We're twitifying.
[00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:28.200]   It is pretty amazing.
[00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:30.440]   I don't know how this happened.
[00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:33.240]   As long as we're talking to people, Sal's a gland is here.
[00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:36.760]   Matt, why don't you bring that mic over to Sal.
[00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:39.360]   Matt, send me a say, "Grenno Witski."
[00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:43.160]   We have a twit intern, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:50.720]   This is Sal's, the Goyan Sal is the king of Apple Talk, the Apple Talk product manager
[00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:51.720]   at Apple.
[00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:52.720]   And a great guy.
[00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:54.520]   I learned a lot about Apple Talk.
[00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:56.320]   Apple Script, I'm sorry.
[00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:57.320]   Apple Talk.
[00:40:57.320 --> 00:41:01.520]   I think the Apple Talk product manager is a very lonely guy right now.
[00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:02.520]   Long gone.
[00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:04.960]   The Apple Script product manager.
[00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:07.000]   I learned a lot from you on the last Mac Mania.
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:08.760]   On the Geek Cruise, yeah.
[00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:09.760]   It was incredible.
[00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:10.760]   That was wonderful.
[00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:14.920]   And you showed me Automated before it came out in Tiger, and that is amazing.
[00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:15.920]   I'm sorry.
[00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:18.120]   You didn't show anything.
[00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:19.120]   I know nothing.
[00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:20.120]   What was that again?
[00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:22.040]   That'll be a sponge from the record.
[00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:23.040]   No, wait a minute.
[00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:24.040]   Let me think.
[00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:25.040]   That wasn't so long ago.
[00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:26.960]   It was after Tiger came out.
[00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:27.960]   Right.
[00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:30.000]   So how are things going now?
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.600]   It's, Automated is taking off like crazy.
[00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:35.920]   It's really, acceptance has been incredible.
[00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:40.200]   It's actually raised awareness about Apple Script, and we have more interest in Apple
[00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:41.880]   Script and Automated than we ever had before.
[00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:42.880]   I love Apple Script.
[00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:46.840]   I mean, for automating your workflows, for getting stuff done, it's just really nice
[00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:48.280]   to have that nice high level language.
[00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:52.840]   I find myself doing more and more in Apple Script and less and less in Pearl or Shell or
[00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:54.400]   you know, it's just really great.
[00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:55.400]   It's very approachable.
[00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:59.320]   I mean, you don't have to really get down and dirty with it so much.
[00:41:59.320 --> 00:42:04.880]   It's English like language that lets you control applications and the computer itself.
[00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:06.360]   We missed you on the last Geek Cruise.
[00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:07.360]   Yes.
[00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:08.360]   Are you going on the next one?
[00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:09.360]   Oh yeah.
[00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:13.600]   I'll be on the Geek Cruise to Acapulco and I'll be on the following one to the Mediterranean.
[00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:16.080]   Oh, you're going to see, I haven't said about the Mediterranean, but I'm going on the
[00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:17.080]   - I've got to go.
[00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:20.080]   - I'm going on the Mexican Riviera that's in February and the Mediterranean is in July,
[00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:21.080]   right?
[00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:22.080]   That's right.
[00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:23.080]   Yeah.
[00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:24.080]   Yeah.
[00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:25.080]   So that's GeekCruises.com.
[00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:26.080]   Yes.
[00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:27.080]   Give them a little plug.
[00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:28.080]   Because Woz will be there with us as well.
[00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:29.080]   Yes.
[00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:30.880]   And I'll be teaching a class again on Apple Script and one on Automated as well.
[00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:31.880]   Oh, that's fine.
[00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:35.360]   That's the highlight of my life that Woz took the Apple Script class and showed up for
[00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:36.360]   the second day.
[00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:37.360]   It was so cool.
[00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:38.360]   That was so cool.
[00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:39.360]   It was amazing.
[00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:40.360]   It was amazing.
[00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:43.640]   He shows up with these Christmas and then goes to the classes, which is like, what?
[00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:45.000]   Don't you know all this?
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:46.680]   I already did all the scripts and everything else.
[00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:47.680]   It's great.
[00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:48.680]   That's really great.
[00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:49.680]   Well, Sal, it's nice to see you.
[00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:50.680]   Thank you.
[00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:51.680]   Thank you for coming by.
[00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:52.680]   Thank you.
[00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:53.680]   Thank you for everybody for showing up at the Apple Store today.
[00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:54.680]   We really appreciate it.
[00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:56.680]   Oh, it's a nice crab we got here.
[00:42:56.680 --> 00:42:57.680]   I'll tell you.
[00:42:57.680 --> 00:42:58.680]   It's Arlo around.
[00:42:58.680 --> 00:42:59.680]   Where's Arlo?
[00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:00.680]   Arlo Rose.
[00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:02.560]   Arlo Rose, are you here?
[00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:04.360]   Because I wanted to say hi to Arlo, too.
[00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:05.720]   Here's coming up here.
[00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:07.400]   You can give Arlo the mic.
[00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:09.200]   Go on over to the bozo nose.
[00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:10.200]   You're talking to the nose.
[00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:12.920]   We got a red muff on our mic, so it's easy to find.
[00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:15.160]   Arlo goes to the red nose.
[00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:16.160]   Yeah, cool.
[00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:17.160]   Arlo created confabulator.
[00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:19.160]   Don't you love confabulator?
[00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:20.160]   I love confabulator.
[00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:22.400]   Isn't it incredible?
[00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:27.840]   And of course, Apple kind of, we won't say ripped you off, but dashboard.
[00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:28.840]   But I have to say, I want it.
[00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:29.840]   I will.
[00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:32.600]   I can't comment on that.
[00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:33.600]   I understand.
[00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:34.600]   I understand.
[00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:39.640]   But I have to say, I used dashboard for a while and I went back to confabulator because
[00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:43.800]   I like the additional functionality, be able to see it all the time or put it on the desktop
[00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:44.800]   and stuff like that.
[00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:46.440]   It really makes it a more useful product.
[00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:49.040]   So you just sold, though, the company to who?
[00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:50.040]   To Yahoo.
[00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:51.040]   Yahoo.
[00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:53.600]   So did you say when they called?
[00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:56.400]   Did you go Yahoo?
[00:43:56.400 --> 00:44:00.880]   It's actually kind of a long story that began with Microsoft and ended with Yahoo.
[00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:05.520]   I can't really tell the story, but let's just say that we'd much rather work at Yahoo
[00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:06.520]   than Microsoft.
[00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:07.520]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:09.720]   Because you do offer it for Windows and Macintosh.
[00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:10.720]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:15.840]   We've been doing a cross-platform version, which the whole reason was because we love
[00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:19.800]   the Mac platform dearly and we wanted to make sure that as many people could get their
[00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:22.520]   hands on it as possible to create really cool widgets.
[00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:23.520]   That would be cross-platform?
[00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:24.520]   That would be cross-platform.
[00:44:24.520 --> 00:44:27.600]   The more people that made it for Windows, the more people got to use it on the Mac.
[00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:30.600]   And it was a real amazing success.
[00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:33.360]   And now with the whole Yahoo involvement, it's crazy.
[00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:39.560]   We get hundreds of submissions a day to the gallery and we're just making our way through
[00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:40.560]   them.
[00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:41.560]   Wow.
[00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:43.760]   And we get millions and millions of downloads a week of these guys.
[00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:45.440]   It's very similar to Dashboard.
[00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:48.680]   You write in JavaScript, you create resources that are images and so forth.
[00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:51.040]   It's very similar to the Dashboard development model.
[00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:52.040]   Yep.
[00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:57.360]   It's actually pretty much identical minus the fact that we use XML and they use DHTML
[00:44:57.360 --> 00:44:58.960]   as a base.
[00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:02.600]   But with our next version, we can do some really cool stuff that actually makes them
[00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:05.960]   more Dashboard-like with the embedded views.
[00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:11.320]   And we're doing some stuff with Yahoo login technology so that if you're a Yahoo user,
[00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:14.920]   you can have persistent preferences if you log into your machine.
[00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:18.160]   So you have all sorts of cool widgets up on your desktop at work.
[00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:22.120]   You can have them up on your same ones at home with the same information, same positions
[00:45:22.120 --> 00:45:23.120]   and everything.
[00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:24.120]   Oh, I really like it.
[00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:25.120]   It's going to be really cool.
[00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:29.040]   We've got a really great developer who just came on board who does really neat game widgets.
[00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:33.680]   He's on the audience over there and named Rob Mark-Wort and he's hopefully going to
[00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:35.400]   do some really cool stuff with us too.
[00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:37.840]   A great widget developer, really great guy.
[00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:40.000]   The thing I like the best is Yahoo's giving it away now.
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:41.200]   Yeah, totally free.
[00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:43.440]   Download it, do whatever you want to with it.
[00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:46.320]   Make cool widgets, give it to your friends, put it on CDs.
[00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:47.320]   Wait.
[00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:48.320]   I'm like, you can do that, right?
[00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:49.320]   That's a lot.
[00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:50.320]   Yeah.
[00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:52.600]   K-O-N-F-A-B-U-L-A-T-O-R dot com.
[00:45:52.600 --> 00:45:56.400]   Yeah, I've always been one of my favorites and I like it that it's free now.
[00:45:56.400 --> 00:45:57.480]   Yeah, and we love you for that.
[00:45:57.480 --> 00:46:01.160]   If it wasn't for the screen savers, our Windows beta program, I don't know what would have
[00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:02.160]   happened.
[00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:06.000]   That day that you talked about it, we had thousands and thousands of people within minutes
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:07.000]   signing up for our program.
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:09.760]   Was that the day you made the widget of me, the looking leader?
[00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:10.760]   No, no, no.
[00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:11.760]   That was another time.
[00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:12.760]   About a year after that.
[00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:13.760]   Okay, I still use that widget.
[00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:15.480]   We've got to update it because it puts the tech TV search.
[00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:16.480]   Oh, you're right.
[00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:17.480]   That's no good.
[00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:19.720]   I'll do an update of it this weekend.
[00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:21.920]   That's all right.
[00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:22.920]   Thank you.
[00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:23.920]   It's great to see you.
[00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:24.920]   I'm glad you're here.
[00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:25.920]   You're here.
[00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:26.920]   You're here too, Patrick.
[00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:27.920]   Congratulations on the success of the confederate leader.
[00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:28.920]   I'm glad.
[00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:29.920]   Good things sometimes happen.
[00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:30.920]   Yeah.
[00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:32.920]   It might have been a little bit of a curve, but no road, but that's...
[00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:33.920]   But it was worth it.
[00:46:33.920 --> 00:46:34.920]   It was worth it.
[00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:36.920]   Oh, are you putting the show notes today, Patrick?
[00:46:36.920 --> 00:46:37.920]   I hope you are.
[00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:38.920]   Does it still be a paid version?
[00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:39.920]   No, no, no.
[00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:40.920]   It's going to be...
[00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:43.000]   Well, something I probably shouldn't say, but I will.
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.200]   There will never be a paid version again.
[00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:49.400]   There will never be Yahoo advertising built into the product or the widgets.
[00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:50.400]   Yes.
[00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:53.640]   And we hopefully, and I can't promise this, but there will hopefully never be Yahoo advertising
[00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:58.280]   on any of our websites because we're in a business section that is not slated to make
[00:46:58.280 --> 00:46:59.280]   money.
[00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:03.040]   We will be making widgets that are like the Spider-Man 3 widget probably, but that's not
[00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:04.760]   something you need to download if you don't want to.
[00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:06.760]   And you don't have to be a Yahoo member to download it?
[00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:07.760]   No, definitely not.
[00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:11.200]   But I like the additional functionality of if you are a Yahoo member, your widgets are
[00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:12.200]   on all your machines.
[00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:15.040]   Do I have to then download the widget on each machine or does it automatically kind of
[00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:16.040]   kind of...
[00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:17.760]   I'm not actually sure how that part of it is going to work just yet.
[00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:22.280]   It might actually be something we keep on the server and then spread around if it's something
[00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:23.280]   you have installed.
[00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:25.280]   That's kind of neat because then you're really customizing your desktop.
[00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:26.280]   Yeah, it'll be great.
[00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:31.160]   And you'll be able to do cool stuff with your actual Yahoo finance stuff will show up in
[00:47:31.160 --> 00:47:36.280]   your stock ticker, your regular Yahoo weather stuff will show up in your weather widget.
[00:47:36.280 --> 00:47:38.600]   And again, don't have to be a Yahoo member to use it.
[00:47:38.600 --> 00:47:43.160]   Basically, the business model from Yahoo's perspective is to do the things like the Spider-Man gimmick
[00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:44.720]   so they can like pre-
[00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:48.400]   And actually, that's not the business model for Yahoo for this is that we're doing...
[00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:52.360]   We're opening up all sorts of web XML APIs right now.
[00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:56.760]   And what we want to do is use this as the starting point for getting people hooked on
[00:47:56.760 --> 00:47:58.920]   them and doing really cool projects with them.
[00:47:58.920 --> 00:48:05.000]   So you download Confabulator, you learn how to do the Y photo stuff with the XML APIs
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:09.400]   for Y photo and then you go and add it to your application and then suddenly a lot of
[00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:13.920]   people are using Y photo that didn't necessarily know about it before and now we've got more
[00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:15.360]   customers going to Y photo.
[00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:17.440]   So they're using it as a conduit for other services.
[00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:18.440]   Exactly.
[00:48:18.440 --> 00:48:23.360]   There was a little bit and I'm kind of sensitive to this complaint among Flickr users, that's
[00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:24.360]   Y photo that in order...
[00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:26.560]   No, no, no, no, it's actually totally separate.
[00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:27.560]   Oh, it is separate.
[00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:28.560]   They're not going to merge it too.
[00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:29.560]   They might...
[00:48:29.560 --> 00:48:30.560]   The here was my issue.
[00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:34.040]   I'm a Flickr user and all of a sudden I have to sign up for it to have a Yahoo account to
[00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:35.040]   keep using that.
[00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:36.040]   No, you don't.
[00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:37.040]   Well, they were trying to get people to sign up to Yahoo some...
[00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:39.040]   Eventually, but you don't have to.
[00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:40.040]   I really don't.
[00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:41.040]   Because I don't want to.
[00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:42.040]   I'm a Flickr pro user.
[00:48:42.040 --> 00:48:43.040]   I don't want to kind of merge.
[00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:45.880]   I mean, I'm a Yahoo account too, but I just don't...
[00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:46.880]   Flickr...
[00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:51.520]   I think the problem really was that there isn't really any disadvantage to Flickr users.
[00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:54.600]   It's just Flickr users are kind of anti-corporate.
[00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:56.880]   We don't want it to be part of a bigger company.
[00:48:56.880 --> 00:48:57.880]   Right.
[00:48:57.880 --> 00:48:58.880]   Right.
[00:48:58.880 --> 00:48:59.880]   So it's not...
[00:48:59.880 --> 00:49:00.880]   It's not...
[00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:03.040]   I'll have to do with your code name on Flickr, Big Daddy.
[00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:04.040]   Shh.
[00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:07.280]   That's my private Flickr account.
[00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:10.000]   Now somebody with Big Daddy is going to be getting a lot of the...
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:11.000]   That's actually mine.
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:12.000]   That's actually mine.
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:15.680]   I believe there's a Twit widget, but I may be wrong.
[00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:18.120]   Is there a confabulator widget for Twit?
[00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:19.480]   I believe there is, but maybe not.
[00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:20.480]   It will be shortly.
[00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:21.480]   There...
[00:49:21.480 --> 00:49:22.480]   Yes.
[00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:23.480]   Before this show comes out.
[00:49:23.480 --> 00:49:24.480]   Hey, let's thank you, Arlo.
[00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:25.480]   It's nice to see you.
[00:49:25.480 --> 00:49:26.480]   Let's bring Alex Lindsey up here too.
[00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:28.920]   Can we make an announcement, Alex?
[00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:31.320]   Would it be premature to make an announcement?
[00:49:31.320 --> 00:49:32.960]   Go over to the microphone.
[00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:35.920]   Would it be premature to make an announcement, Alex, about what we're doing together or
[00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:36.920]   no?
[00:49:36.920 --> 00:49:37.920]   No, it's fine.
[00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:38.920]   Can we say that?
[00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:39.920]   Yeah.
[00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:40.920]   Alex Lindsey, you may remember from Call for Help.
[00:49:40.920 --> 00:49:45.040]   Call on Call for Help, the Canadian version, which is now back on G4.
[00:49:45.040 --> 00:49:47.240]   We just noticed because of the emails that I get.
[00:49:47.240 --> 00:49:48.240]   All of a sudden.
[00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:49.240]   Mmm.
[00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:50.240]   Yeah.
[00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:51.240]   It's on a weird time.
[00:49:51.240 --> 00:49:52.240]   It's 11 a.m.
[00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:53.240]   Eastern AAM.
[00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:54.400]   Seems to be effective on their way.
[00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:56.400]   But it's, hey, at least it's back in the United States.
[00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:57.400]   We're happy about that.
[00:49:57.400 --> 00:50:03.280]   Alex is our Photoshop guy and he does Pixel Core, which is an amazing idea, which is
[00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:09.240]   getting people all over the world involved in 2 and 3D graphics design and learning how
[00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:10.240]   to do it.
[00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:14.640]   And once they become skilled, they become part of the Pixel Core.
[00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:15.640]   Getting jobs more than more.
[00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:16.840]   It's a guild, right.
[00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:17.840]   Yeah.
[00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:22.160]   So, I mean, the idea was that, you know, 500 years ago when you wanted to build a castle,
[00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:25.480]   there are a handful of guilds that you would, that you'd go find.
[00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:26.480]   You know, so you'd try to.
[00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:28.920]   The Mason's Guild and the painters and yeah.
[00:50:28.920 --> 00:50:29.920]   All of those different things.
[00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:32.360]   And right now for our industry, there isn't anything like that.
[00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:35.560]   There's no way to find any, sure you can find one or two great ones.
[00:50:35.560 --> 00:50:39.000]   You just can't find 500 of them, which is what we're interested in.
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:40.000]   So we kind of.
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:41.000]   And they're all over the world.
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:42.480]   I mean, you've got Africa, you've got 8 people.
[00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:43.480]   Yeah, we have.
[00:50:43.480 --> 00:50:44.480]   We're in 36 countries.
[00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:45.480]   Wow.
[00:50:45.480 --> 00:50:46.480]   Yeah.
[00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:48.760]   So Alex and I are going to start something in a couple of weeks.
[00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:49.760]   Mac Break.
[00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:53.080]   It's a new half hour Internet only television show.
[00:50:53.080 --> 00:50:54.080]   Yes.
[00:50:54.080 --> 00:50:55.080]   Yeah.
[00:50:55.080 --> 00:50:56.080]   On Macintosh.
[00:50:56.080 --> 00:50:57.080]   Oh.
[00:50:57.080 --> 00:50:58.080]   So we're really excited about that.
[00:50:58.080 --> 00:51:01.320]   We'll be, we'll be, we'll be, we'll be in Roger whenever you're in town.
[00:51:01.320 --> 00:51:02.320]   We'd love to have you on the show, by the way.
[00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:03.320]   Thank you.
[00:51:03.320 --> 00:51:04.320]   Thank you.
[00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:05.320]   We're going to videotape it across the street.
[00:51:05.320 --> 00:51:06.920]   I think over across multiple.
[00:51:06.920 --> 00:51:09.720]   Yeah, our offices are like 100 feet from here.
[00:51:09.720 --> 00:51:12.360]   So, and we're going to do the first one in a couple of weeks, I think.
[00:51:12.360 --> 00:51:13.360]   Yeah.
[00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:15.920]   At the end of September, then it should come up in October.
[00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:17.320]   So that's the first one.
[00:51:17.320 --> 00:51:18.600]   Is there going to be a website?
[00:51:18.600 --> 00:51:21.600]   How will people find out when it's available?
[00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:26.000]   Well we're going to put out announcements, but it'll be MacBreak.com is the website.
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:27.000]   Not up yet.
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:28.000]   It's not up yet.
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:29.000]   But it'll be going up.
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:31.400]   There'll actually be some short daily stuff that starts coming out.
[00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:36.680]   So you'll start seeing stuff, hopefully on the iTunes, you know, on iTunes, podcast
[00:51:36.680 --> 00:51:37.680]   and so on and so forth.
[00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:42.720]   There are little videos that kind of get people prepped for it, and then that'll kind of build
[00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:44.080]   towards the full show.
[00:51:44.080 --> 00:51:47.200]   I'm really excited about that.
[00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:52.640]   All of us, as Twits, that's really what we're excited about is the idea of IP content delivery.
[00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:55.320]   I've been doing audio and Kevin's been doing video.
[00:51:55.320 --> 00:51:57.680]   And you know, I just really think this is the future.
[00:51:57.680 --> 00:52:01.640]   Well the more you research it, the big thing is you have to question whether there is any
[00:52:01.640 --> 00:52:02.640]   future in TV.
[00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:03.640]   At all?
[00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:04.880]   You know, there's why bother.
[00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:10.920]   You know, it was what I kind of start seeing more and more of because you're, you know,
[00:52:10.920 --> 00:52:12.200]   I don't have a TV.
[00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:14.560]   I mean, everything I get is IP.
[00:52:14.560 --> 00:52:19.360]   So you know, everything I watch on my laptop, whenever I watch it, and you know, I got,
[00:52:19.360 --> 00:52:22.000]   we're just testing the little Elgato thing, which seems to work pretty well.
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:25.240]   You know, you can take your cable and record it and turn your Mac into a DVR.
[00:52:25.240 --> 00:52:26.240]   That's the ITV.
[00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:27.240]   Right.
[00:52:27.240 --> 00:52:29.040]   Are you using the HD version or just the R1 500?
[00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:30.040]   We got the HD version.
[00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:31.040]   So yeah.
[00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:32.040]   So it's...
[00:52:32.040 --> 00:52:34.920]   Roger, do you watch IP TV at all?
[00:52:34.920 --> 00:52:35.920]   Yes, I do.
[00:52:35.920 --> 00:52:41.560]   In fact, I watch it all the time and I download Kevin's stuff and you know, I watch it in
[00:52:41.560 --> 00:52:42.560]   the van.
[00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:45.040]   I burn it to video CDs and play it on a 20-inch LCD.
[00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:46.040]   I think that's the future.
[00:52:46.040 --> 00:52:47.040]   That's what I do.
[00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:50.440]   And the thing is that before there was a constrained distribution.
[00:52:50.440 --> 00:52:55.400]   So you had broadcast stations or you had cable networks and the issue now though is with
[00:52:55.400 --> 00:52:58.880]   BitTorrent, I mean, most people think of BitTorrent as this way to pass pirated stuff
[00:52:58.880 --> 00:52:59.880]   around.
[00:52:59.880 --> 00:53:03.440]   But really, when you look at what BitTorrent does is it lets any of us, you know, it breaks
[00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:06.360]   that entire distribution wall down to instead of...
[00:53:06.360 --> 00:53:11.400]   If I had a show that was say 500 megs and I put it out to 500,000 people, that's $100,000
[00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:16.200]   of distribution that it would just to upload it with BitTorrent, it's 500 bucks.
[00:53:16.200 --> 00:53:17.200]   You know, and it's...
[00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:20.880]   And that's an entirely different reality and that means any of us could make shows and
[00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:21.880]   that's what we're going to do.
[00:53:21.880 --> 00:53:22.880]   Well, we'll see.
[00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:25.640]   Macbreak.com and that's coming up later in September.
[00:53:25.640 --> 00:53:27.320]   I'm not competing with you, Kevin.
[00:53:27.320 --> 00:53:29.320]   It's all of us in there together.
[00:53:29.320 --> 00:53:30.320]   Right.
[00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:31.320]   In there.
[00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:32.320]   More the better, I think.
[00:53:32.320 --> 00:53:33.320]   Oh, I agree.
[00:53:33.320 --> 00:53:34.320]   I love Command-In.
[00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:35.320]   Command-In.
[00:53:35.320 --> 00:53:36.320]   Great stuff.
[00:53:36.320 --> 00:53:37.320]   Mike and Amber do that.
[00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:38.320]   And of course, Dignation has video, which is very popular.
[00:53:38.320 --> 00:53:39.320]   We're in a video of Twitter.
[00:53:39.320 --> 00:53:40.320]   Now, is this going to be...
[00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:42.320]   Kevin, you're going to do this on a regular basis.
[00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:43.320]   This is the trial.
[00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:46.960]   Yeah, we're going to try and do it probably one month just to start and then it depends
[00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:47.960]   on how much time Keith has.
[00:53:47.960 --> 00:53:48.960]   He's so busy.
[00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:49.960]   It all comes down to Keith.
[00:53:49.960 --> 00:53:50.960]   Yeah.
[00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:51.960]   He's the kind of the bottleneck.
[00:53:51.960 --> 00:53:53.960]   He's got a video, and he's got to edit it, and he's got to produce it, and he's got to
[00:53:53.960 --> 00:53:54.960]   get it out, right?
[00:53:54.960 --> 00:53:57.360]   You get another Keith, or is there only one?
[00:53:57.360 --> 00:53:58.360]   There's only one Keith.
[00:53:58.360 --> 00:53:59.360]   There's only one Keith.
[00:53:59.360 --> 00:54:00.560]   What do you use to edit?
[00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:02.560]   I don't want to say because this is an app store.
[00:54:02.560 --> 00:54:03.560]   Premier.
[00:54:03.560 --> 00:54:05.080]   They use for your Premier Pro, but we're trying to get it back.
[00:54:05.080 --> 00:54:06.080]   We're going to get a G5.
[00:54:06.080 --> 00:54:08.000]   Keith wants to get on a G5 as soon as possible.
[00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:09.000]   Yeah.
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:10.000]   And use like Final Cut.
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:11.000]   Final Cut.
[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:12.000]   Final Cut.
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:13.000]   All the way, right?
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:14.000]   Yeah.
[00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:15.000]   Is that what you would use, Keith's Final Cut?
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:16.000]   Yeah.
[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:17.000]   You think so?
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:18.000]   Yeah.
[00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:19.000]   We should...
[00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:20.000]   Keith should turn the camera around.
[00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:21.000]   I'm going to interview.
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:22.000]   Yes.
[00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:24.000]   I wanted to say one more thing about IPTV.
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:28.880]   I used to really want like a direct TV satellite thing for our moving vehicle.
[00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:29.880]   Yeah.
[00:54:29.880 --> 00:54:30.880]   And now I...
[00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:31.880]   You don't know.
[00:54:31.880 --> 00:54:36.040]   All I used to do was I'd record the screensavers and you know, like I would watch it.
[00:54:36.040 --> 00:54:38.880]   If I had that, I would watch it and it's not there.
[00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:39.880]   Right.
[00:54:39.880 --> 00:54:40.880]   So, why bother?
[00:54:40.880 --> 00:54:43.320]   Well, if we do the screensavers again, it's very likely we'll do it on IPTV.
[00:54:43.320 --> 00:54:44.320]   Yeah.
[00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:46.160]   I mean, that would be the logical way to do it.
[00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:47.160]   Patrick's doing video.
[00:54:47.160 --> 00:54:51.800]   In fact, I've watched a few of them now, and you've got the audio working, and it's actually...
[00:54:51.800 --> 00:54:52.800]   I'm now liking it a lot.
[00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:53.800]   I mean, you really got a great job.
[00:54:53.800 --> 00:54:56.040]   Can I have a Devorak moment here?
[00:54:56.040 --> 00:54:57.040]   Please.
[00:54:57.040 --> 00:54:58.040]   Digitallifetv.com.
[00:54:58.040 --> 00:55:02.120]   Episode 4, we do live on Tuesday, available for download Tuesday night.
[00:55:02.120 --> 00:55:05.120]   And Patrick was not at work in the last Twitter.
[00:55:05.120 --> 00:55:07.760]   You did a masterful editing job.
[00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:08.760]   You would never know.
[00:55:08.760 --> 00:55:09.760]   No.
[00:55:09.760 --> 00:55:10.760]   You would never know, would you?
[00:55:10.760 --> 00:55:13.520]   By the way, the mic that you love so much for Skype?
[00:55:13.520 --> 00:55:14.520]   Yeah.
[00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:15.520]   $3.
[00:55:15.520 --> 00:55:16.520]   Great for China.
[00:55:16.520 --> 00:55:22.280]   You can use $75 headset for a $3 one, and Leo will like the $3 one better.
[00:55:22.280 --> 00:55:23.280]   It sounded really good.
[00:55:23.280 --> 00:55:24.280]   It's not scary.
[00:55:24.280 --> 00:55:25.280]   And it wasn't USB or anything.
[00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:26.280]   You just plugged it in.
[00:55:26.280 --> 00:55:27.280]   You plug straight into the notebook.
[00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:31.040]   You know what I would like to do is give the people in the audience a chance to ask questions.
[00:55:31.040 --> 00:55:35.040]   So why don't we put that mic in the stand, and if people...
[00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:38.000]   Or actually, hold on to it, Matt, and you can actually get to them, maybe.
[00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:39.000]   It'd be easier.
[00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:40.680]   Yeah, it'd be a lot easier, because they're all over the place.
[00:55:40.680 --> 00:55:43.000]   So if you've got a wireless for now, thanks for that.
[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:46.280]   Yeah, that's the next step, is wireless, and I also need a phone interface, and I need
[00:55:46.280 --> 00:55:48.240]   a microphone for the guitars and the saxophones.
[00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:50.640]   Do you want to play a little bit for us a little bit?
[00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:53.600]   Yeah, I'll play just a little bit, you know, like, let's see what...
[00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:58.640]   Can you play that wild riff, the 8-melz-high on the 7-stream?
[00:55:58.640 --> 00:56:01.280]   Yeah, I can do that, but I'll tell you what...
[00:56:01.280 --> 00:56:02.800]   You weren't here, John, when I was saying that...
[00:56:02.800 --> 00:56:05.040]   Hold your mic up to the guitar.
[00:56:05.040 --> 00:56:06.640]   Yeah, we got to have a mic on the...
[00:56:06.640 --> 00:56:12.480]   Give me the little red mic, and I'll be your mic stand.
[00:56:12.480 --> 00:56:18.880]   That sounds beautiful.
[00:56:18.880 --> 00:56:23.520]   That really should be... I should put my leg up here, because it's hard in this position.
[00:56:23.520 --> 00:56:26.520]   I was telling you weren't here, John, but I was saying that the last time I saw Roger
[00:56:26.520 --> 00:56:30.520]   McGwin was 1975, with a rolling thunder review with Bob Dylan, Joe Beaz, and Mick
[00:56:30.520 --> 00:56:42.360]   Ronson, who played 8-melz-high, and I was, in fact, 8-melz-high.
[00:56:42.360 --> 00:56:50.880]   I think I saw God that night actually.
[00:56:50.880 --> 00:57:00.880]   [Music]
[00:57:00.880 --> 00:57:10.880]   [Music]
[00:57:10.880 --> 00:57:20.880]   [Music]
[00:57:20.880 --> 00:57:35.880]   Yeah, Roger McGwin.
[00:57:35.880 --> 00:57:38.880]   I should ask, is that podcast safe?
[00:57:38.880 --> 00:57:40.880]   Yeah, that was cool.
[00:57:40.880 --> 00:57:42.880]   You own that, and you give me the rights to...
[00:57:42.880 --> 00:57:44.880]   Yeah, you got the rights.
[00:57:44.880 --> 00:57:46.880]   [Applause]
[00:57:46.880 --> 00:57:48.880]   Hey, thank you Ben Williamson and Apple.
[00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:55.880]   We really thank Apple stores for allowing us to use their facility for our very first
[00:57:55.880 --> 00:57:57.880]   GWT recorded in front of a live audience.
[00:57:57.880 --> 00:57:59.880]   We thank all of you for being here.
[00:57:59.880 --> 00:58:00.880]   This is really great.
[00:58:00.880 --> 00:58:05.600]   Now, we just gave away an iPod, and we also thanks to Apple, but we also gave away a bunch
[00:58:05.600 --> 00:58:08.880]   of these GWT hoodies.
[00:58:08.880 --> 00:58:12.880]   And I'll be honest, Ben called me and said, "Well, your sweatshirts have arrived."
[00:58:12.880 --> 00:58:13.880]   I said, "What?
[00:58:13.880 --> 00:58:16.720]   Because I was going to get pocket protectors, and I apologize to you all, but they didn't
[00:58:16.720 --> 00:58:17.720]   come in time.
[00:58:17.720 --> 00:58:20.720]   They're not ordered, but of course everything takes longer than you think.
[00:58:20.720 --> 00:58:23.720]   We'll have them certainly by our next live broadcast of December 18th at Noonan's, and
[00:58:23.720 --> 00:58:25.720]   I hope you'll come for that.
[00:58:25.720 --> 00:58:28.720]   But these sweatshirts came from a listener.
[00:58:28.720 --> 00:58:33.720]   It says, "Leo and Kukungats, in your first live show, I hope it's a success.
[00:58:33.720 --> 00:58:34.720]   Please enjoy these sweatshirts.
[00:58:34.720 --> 00:58:36.720]   They're in thanks for all of the entertaining shows.
[00:58:36.720 --> 00:58:40.720]   You might think it's an odd color choice, but this is actually reflective ink.
[00:58:40.720 --> 00:58:44.720]   So take a photo of somebody wearing it with a flash, and you'll see what I mean.
[00:58:44.720 --> 00:58:47.720]   It's a glimmer.
[00:58:47.720 --> 00:58:48.720]   It's a glimmer.
[00:58:48.720 --> 00:58:49.720]   It's a glimmer.
[00:58:49.720 --> 00:58:50.720]   It's a glimmer.
[00:58:50.720 --> 00:58:51.720]   It's a glimmer.
[00:58:51.720 --> 00:58:52.720]   It's a glimmer.
[00:58:52.720 --> 00:58:53.720]   It's a glimmer.
[00:58:53.720 --> 00:58:54.720]   It's a glimmer.
[00:58:54.720 --> 00:58:55.720]   It's a glimmer.
[00:58:55.720 --> 00:58:56.720]   It's a glimmer.
[00:58:56.720 --> 00:58:57.720]   It's a glimmer.
[00:58:57.720 --> 00:58:58.720]   It's a glimmer.
[00:58:58.720 --> 00:58:59.720]   It's a glimmer.
[00:58:59.720 --> 00:59:00.720]   It's a glimmer.
[00:59:00.720 --> 00:59:01.720]   It's a glimmer.
[00:59:01.720 --> 00:59:02.720]   It's a glimmer.
[00:59:02.720 --> 00:59:03.720]   It's a glimmer.
[00:59:03.720 --> 00:59:04.720]   It's a glimmer.
[00:59:04.720 --> 00:59:05.720]   It's a glimmer.
[00:59:05.720 --> 00:59:06.720]   It's a glimmer.
[00:59:06.720 --> 00:59:07.720]   It's a glimmer.
[00:59:07.720 --> 00:59:08.720]   It's a glimmer.
[00:59:08.720 --> 00:59:09.720]   It's a glimmer.
[00:59:09.720 --> 00:59:10.720]   It's a glimmer.
[00:59:10.720 --> 00:59:11.720]   It's a glimmer.
[00:59:11.720 --> 00:59:12.720]   It's a glimmer.
[00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:14.720]   It's a glimmer.
[00:59:14.720 --> 00:59:15.720]   It's a glimmer.
[00:59:15.720 --> 00:59:16.720]   It's a glimmer.
[00:59:16.720 --> 00:59:17.720]   It's a glimmer.
[00:59:17.720 --> 00:59:18.720]   It's a glimmer.
[00:59:18.720 --> 00:59:19.720]   It's a glimmer.
[00:59:19.720 --> 00:59:20.720]   It's a glimmer.
[00:59:20.720 --> 00:59:21.720]   It's a glimmer.
[00:59:21.720 --> 00:59:22.720]   It's a glimmer.
[00:59:22.720 --> 00:59:23.720]   It's a glimmer.
[00:59:23.720 --> 00:59:24.720]   It's a glimmer.
[00:59:24.720 --> 00:59:25.720]   It's a glimmer.
[00:59:25.720 --> 00:59:26.720]   It's a glimmer.
[00:59:26.720 --> 00:59:27.720]   It's a glimmer.
[00:59:27.720 --> 00:59:28.720]   It's a glimmer.
[00:59:28.720 --> 00:59:29.720]   It's a glimmer.
[00:59:29.720 --> 00:59:30.720]   It's a glimmer.
[00:59:30.720 --> 00:59:31.720]   It's a glimmer.
[00:59:31.720 --> 00:59:32.720]   It's a glimmer.
[00:59:32.720 --> 00:59:33.720]   It's a glimmer.
[00:59:33.720 --> 00:59:34.720]   It's a glimmer.
[00:59:34.720 --> 00:59:35.720]   It's a glimmer.
[00:59:35.720 --> 00:59:36.720]   It's a glimmer.
[00:59:36.720 --> 00:59:37.720]   It's a glimmer.
[00:59:37.720 --> 00:59:38.720]   It's a glimmer.
[00:59:38.720 --> 00:59:39.720]   It's a glimmer.
[00:59:39.720 --> 00:59:40.720]   It's a glimmer.
[00:59:40.720 --> 00:59:42.720]   Can I say one more thing?
[00:59:42.720 --> 00:59:45.720]   The HD7 Acoustic Guitar Magazine is giving one away free.
[00:59:45.720 --> 00:59:46.720]   Oh, neat.
[00:59:46.720 --> 00:59:49.720]   Yeah, Martin Guitar Company and Acoustic Guitar Magazine have gotten together.
[00:59:49.720 --> 00:59:51.720]   All you have to do is sign up.
[00:59:51.720 --> 00:59:52.720]   I don't know.
[00:59:52.720 --> 00:59:53.720]   It doesn't take anything.
[00:59:53.720 --> 00:59:54.720]   You don't have to buy anything.
[00:59:54.720 --> 00:59:55.720]   Go online, I think, right?
[00:59:55.720 --> 00:59:56.720]   It's online at acousticguitarmagazine.com.
[00:59:56.720 --> 00:59:57.720]   We'll put a link in the show notes.
[00:59:57.720 --> 00:59:58.720]   That's a beauty.
[00:59:58.720 --> 01:00:00.720]   That sound is so incredible coming out of there.
[01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:01.720]   I don't know if I did it justice.
[01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:03.720]   I mean, we had to, you know, I mean, that was an SM57.
[01:00:03.720 --> 01:00:04.720]   The Patrick...
[01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:07.720]   The punk-rock microphone of choice is Patrick.
[01:00:07.720 --> 01:00:08.720]   Yeah.
[01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:09.720]   We used them for many years.
[01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:10.720]   Does your guitar manufacturing?
[01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:11.720]   Martin?
[01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:12.720]   Yeah, Martin.
[01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:13.720]   Really?
[01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:14.720]   Yeah.
[01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:15.720]   So there you go.
[01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:16.720]   I mean, that's a nice, nice picture.
[01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:17.720]   And price?
[01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:19.720]   It goes for $5,400, but you can get them for less.
[01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:20.720]   That's not all.
[01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:21.720]   That's not all.
[01:00:21.720 --> 01:00:22.720]   Street prices in the '40s.
[01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:23.720]   That's awful for a really good.
[01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:25.720]   Yeah, they are handmade.
[01:00:25.720 --> 01:00:26.720]   Well.
[01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:27.720]   Made by hands.
[01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:30.720]   Yeah, they're made by human people in America.
[01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:31.720]   Yeah.
[01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:32.720]   All right.
[01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:35.720]   So thank you, everybody, for being here and thanks to the Apple Store.
[01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:40.720]   We can take some audience questions, Matt, Granawitski, our Twitter.
[01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:46.720]   He's a private in the Twitter army, but he'll be corporal if he keeps this up.
[01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:50.080]   Just raise your hand if you have a question you'd like to ask or a comment you'd like
[01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:51.320]   to make about Twitter.
[01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:52.320]   You can raise your hand.
[01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:53.320]   How old is he?
[01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:54.320]   Is he two?
[01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:56.000]   If you have a question, it's okay.
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:57.480]   He's well-trained from school.
[01:00:57.480 --> 01:00:58.480]   Yeah.
[01:00:58.480 --> 01:00:59.480]   Do you need a potty break?
[01:00:59.480 --> 01:01:00.720]   Because I can give you a pass.
[01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:01.720]   And, you know...
[01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:02.720]   Go ahead.
[01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:03.720]   Just take somebody at random.
[01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:04.720]   There you go.
[01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:05.720]   Yes, sir.
[01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:06.720]   What's your name?
[01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:07.720]   Brooke Drum.
[01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:08.720]   Hi, Brooke.
[01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:09.720]   Welcome.
[01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:11.720]   I just wonder what the business model is for this.
[01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:14.720]   Either you guys are rich or you're bored.
[01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:18.720]   Because, I mean, you guys are well-known, but guys like us want to start a podcast or
[01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:20.720]   a video cast, no one knows us.
[01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:21.720]   Right.
[01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:22.720]   So what's the incentive?
[01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:24.720]   Is it just for fun or is there a way to make money off this?
[01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:26.720]   It's a lot of guys like you from taking our, you know...
[01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:27.720]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:01:27.720 --> 01:01:30.720]   Actually, if we didn't do it, you know, then we'd be a problem.
[01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:31.720]   It's fun for me.
[01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:32.720]   You're not taking advertising or anything.
[01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:33.720]   No.
[01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:34.720]   How do you do it?
[01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:35.720]   Patrick, you raised your hand.
[01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:36.720]   Would you explain our business model?
[01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:41.120]   This is partially just pure vicious bitterness and vengeance on the part of a bunch of people
[01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:42.120]   who've been...
[01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:43.120]   Do you remember the original name of the show?
[01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:44.120]   Yeah.
[01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:45.520]   The Revenge of the Screen Savers.
[01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:48.720]   It was almost, you could say, it was purely motivated by Malice.
[01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:49.720]   You know.
[01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:51.720]   There's no money in that, though.
[01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:52.720]   Well, don't knock Malice.
[01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:55.720]   There's a lot of money in that because it works really well on major media.
[01:01:55.720 --> 01:01:57.120]   Just look around at what gets broadcast.
[01:01:57.120 --> 01:01:58.320]   I mean, Jerry Springer.
[01:01:58.320 --> 01:02:00.320]   All about the hate, right?
[01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:01.320]   Somebody sent me an email.
[01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:03.520]   I got the greatest email saying, "What's your business model?"
[01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:05.520]   Because he says, "You know, I know you do this and this.
[01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:06.520]   You make all the money on books.
[01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:07.520]   What are you making?
[01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:08.520]   How are you making a living?"
[01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:09.520]   But we have day jobs.
[01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:10.520]   We all have day jobs.
[01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:12.520]   You know, I do TV and radio show.
[01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:13.520]   And Patrick works at PC Magazine.
[01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:14.520]   Wait, wait.
[01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:17.520]   Who here doesn't work full-time for themselves or someone else?
[01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:23.160]   Well, the only one who really is in this for real is Prager and Kevin because they're
[01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:24.160]   doing revision three.
[01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:25.160]   And that's...
[01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:27.160]   And they're the ones really putting their butts in the line.
[01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:28.160]   But we all have jobs.
[01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:31.160]   And I'll get fired if enough people don't watch Digital Life TV.
[01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:32.160]   Did you?
[01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:33.160]   Did you?
[01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:34.160]   What's your business model?
[01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:36.160]   These guys are just blowing smoke.
[01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:38.160]   A business model will emerge.
[01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:40.960]   That's not blowing smoke?
[01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:41.960]   One will emerge.
[01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:44.360]   I think really at this point, I mean, the model is...
[01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:46.640]   And all of this is paid for by donations.
[01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:49.120]   So we do it for free.
[01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:52.040]   Although I think we have enough donations that we could probably just pay people, you
[01:02:52.040 --> 01:02:55.520]   know, some small amount of money for appearing on it.
[01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:56.520]   But it's not a business.
[01:02:56.520 --> 01:02:58.160]   We never created it as a business.
[01:02:58.160 --> 01:02:59.480]   We created it because we like doing it.
[01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:00.480]   It's a public service.
[01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:01.480]   Well, it's not that either.
[01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:02.480]   We created it because we like doing it.
[01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:03.480]   It's fun.
[01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:04.480]   It's fun.
[01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:05.480]   It's fun.
[01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:06.480]   People like it.
[01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:07.480]   It's a public service.
[01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:09.480]   I like to look at... like the Grateful Dead had a place where you could record their stuff,
[01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:10.480]   you know, and...
[01:03:10.480 --> 01:03:11.480]   Right.
[01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:12.480]   A tapers... a tapers for good.
[01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:13.480]   Yeah.
[01:03:13.480 --> 01:03:14.480]   And it didn't hurt them.
[01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:16.480]   They got bigger than any other band in the world.
[01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:17.480]   Yeah.
[01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:18.480]   You know, we all get some benefit.
[01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:20.480]   I don't think call for help would be back on G4.
[01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:23.480]   My blog is tomorrow.org/blog.
[01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:25.480]   The numbers have doubled.
[01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:26.480]   Have it?
[01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:28.480]   If you say it again, it might go triple, you know?
[01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:29.480]   Tomorrow.org/blog.
[01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:30.480]   There you go.
[01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:31.480]   Look at that.
[01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:32.480]   It's got some publicity out of it.
[01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:34.480]   But publicity in itself doesn't make the money.
[01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:35.480]   Yeah.
[01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:37.480]   And most of the time we reject that kind of thing.
[01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:38.480]   Yeah.
[01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:39.480]   But the thing is, is right now...
[01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:40.480]   Why are you not on mic?
[01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:41.480]   Can you put your mic somewhere that I can hear it?
[01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:42.480]   It's been there the whole...
[01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:43.480]   I know, but I don't hear you very well.
[01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:44.480]   Is it unplugged?
[01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:45.480]   No, no.
[01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:46.480]   I can hear you.
[01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:47.480]   Just talk into it a little more.
[01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:48.480]   Yeah.
[01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:49.480]   When I do that, I breathe.
[01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:50.480]   Whatever.
[01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:51.480]   You need to get up to that.
[01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:52.480]   Don't breathe either, though.
[01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:53.480]   Yes.
[01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:54.480]   You can talk, but not breathe.
[01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:56.480]   The thing is, like, the model for all this IP stuff is... right.
[01:03:56.480 --> 01:03:58.480]   To borrow from Devore, it's all evolving, right?
[01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:03.480]   There's no Nielsen.
[01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:06.480]   There's no arbitron rating system.
[01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:09.480]   And the problem is, if you're looking for somebody else to pay for this,
[01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:14.480]   they either have to trust and believe in your product, like a sponsorship you get for a race car, which is a nightmare to get,
[01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:21.480]   or you have to prove by hosting all of your own content that you have a large enough user base to warrant somebody spending on it, right?
[01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:24.480]   The advertising model is usually CPM cost per thousand listeners.
[01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:31.480]   And I think it says, "Hey, I had 150,000 downloads last week at the 150,000 bodies, or it's done through other means."
[01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:34.480]   And it's a messy, messy, messy system to set up.
[01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:36.480]   We have proof of numbers.
[01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:39.480]   We have good numbers, and we could probably make money on this.
[01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:43.480]   In fact, we're turning away advertisers all the time.
[01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:50.480]   We didn't want advertisers because we didn't want to have anybody tell us that, first of all, we weren't completely independent.
[01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:52.480]   We didn't want anybody snooping into...
[01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:56.480]   You know, we're all rebels. We're rebelling against except for Devorek.
[01:04:56.480 --> 01:04:59.480]   No, I think it's true. That's how this got started, John, as we did.
[01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:02.480]   The only limit we give ourselves is just that PG 13 rating.
[01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:04.480]   Get these sound hyzer hits.
[01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:06.480]   AOL, one of the...
[01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:09.480]   There is a condition for the bandwidth we get from AOL.
[01:05:09.480 --> 01:05:12.480]   We get two things from AOL. We get bandwidth, so we don't have to pay for that,
[01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:16.480]   which is something that you as a podcaster would have to figure out how we're going to do that.
[01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:18.480]   You could do BitTorrent, but then you couldn't be on iTunes.
[01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:21.480]   And iTunes is a very important publicity meeting.
[01:05:21.480 --> 01:05:24.480]   So that's an issue. We get bandwidth from AOL in return.
[01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:29.480]   We actually get two things. We get bandwidth and they play this on AOL radio, which is very valuable.
[01:05:29.480 --> 01:05:33.480]   It's 10 million uniques a month. So that exposes us to a large audience.
[01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:40.480]   So they're giving us airplay and they're giving us bandwidth in return for us saying AOL radio, you know, thanks for the bandwidth, which we've just done, so we don't have to do it again.
[01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:43.480]   But that's the only business deal we have on this.
[01:05:43.480 --> 01:05:47.480]   And I'm happy about it. I don't have to deal with those people.
[01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:49.480]   I don't want to have to talk to an advertiser every week.
[01:05:49.480 --> 01:05:51.480]   It's cool to be on your own. I just love it.
[01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:56.480]   We're very lucky. We can do what we like to do. And people enjoy it.
[01:05:56.480 --> 01:06:00.480]   I think that that's a privilege. So there is not really a business model.
[01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:04.480]   I mean, if you want to do your own podcast, you could create one.
[01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:06.480]   Subscription or advertising, the two ways to go.
[01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:09.480]   But I don't think anybody is yet really making money and podcasting.
[01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:11.480]   You do it as a labor of love still.
[01:06:11.480 --> 01:06:15.480]   Do you think John was kind of skeptical about podcasting at first?
[01:06:15.480 --> 01:06:18.480]   Do you think that podcasting will become viable commercial medium?
[01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:22.480]   Yeah. And the funny thing about it is that right now, whatever our numbers are,
[01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:28.480]   probably about, I mean, potentially a third or a tenth of what they could be.
[01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:35.480]   Because it turns out that the podcast technology, the way you do it properly with an RSS feed
[01:06:35.480 --> 01:06:39.480]   and the automatic download and the rest of it, to typically an iPod.
[01:06:39.480 --> 01:06:45.480]   And if you look at the numbers, in fact, I see this when I plug the blog and then I get these hits.
[01:06:45.480 --> 01:06:51.480]   And I see the Mac numbers go away. It's mostly Mac users that are kind of at the cutting edge of this whole thing.
[01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:52.480]   Yeah. Well, and that's why...
[01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:56.480]   And when the other side gets in on it, it's going to be enormously big.
[01:06:56.480 --> 01:07:02.480]   Yeah. I mean, and the numbers that we have right now, once I think the market settles in on the concept,
[01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:07.480]   or a podcast being cool and listened to in the car, for example, a lot of people listen to them in their car.
[01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:10.480]   Or casually, or when they're jogging.
[01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:14.480]   Once I think that becomes ubiquitous, which appears to be headed,
[01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:18.480]   I think our numbers on this show will easily go over a million listeners.
[01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:19.480]   I want to build up that problem.
[01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:23.480]   There is ego involved. I mean, we would love to be the first podcast to have a million listeners.
[01:07:23.480 --> 01:07:25.480]   I mean, if that's the payoff, that's...
[01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:31.480]   Roger, I mean, as a performer, I think it's true. Programmers, I think it's true of most people.
[01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:33.480]   Moneterect, you've got to feed yourself.
[01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:34.480]   Yeah.
[01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:35.480]   But really...
[01:07:35.480 --> 01:07:36.480]   It's about more than money.
[01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:39.480]   What really makes it is the acknowledgement of your peers.
[01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:41.480]   Exactly. I love the work. I love doing it.
[01:07:41.480 --> 01:07:45.480]   I love getting on stage and playing for people and the feedback I get from that.
[01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:46.480]   That's the payback.
[01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:47.480]   That's the payback.
[01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:48.480]   He just played for free.
[01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:49.480]   Yeah.
[01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:52.480]   Well, like the joke about the musician and won the lottery, they said, "What are you going to do with the money?"
[01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:55.480]   He said, "I'm going to keep on playing till the money runs out."
[01:07:55.480 --> 01:08:00.480]   But if people ask, "Well, what's the business model for open source?"
[01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:04.480]   People do stuff. I think human beings will do stuff that we love.
[01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:10.480]   As long as we can eat and have a roofer, we'll do stuff we love, whether that feeds that or not,
[01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:12.480]   and that people give us positive feedback.
[01:08:12.480 --> 01:08:14.480]   I think we've beaten this to death.
[01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:15.480]   Okay. Next question.
[01:08:15.480 --> 01:08:16.480]   What's the name of your podcast?
[01:08:16.480 --> 01:08:17.480]   Yeah.
[01:08:17.480 --> 01:08:18.480]   You're going to do a podcast?
[01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:19.480]   Yeah.
[01:08:19.480 --> 01:08:20.480]   Vault Multimedia.com.
[01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:21.480]   Vault Multimedia.com.
[01:08:21.480 --> 01:08:23.480]   And what's it about?
[01:08:23.480 --> 01:08:25.480]   It's actually about how to use technology in churches.
[01:08:25.480 --> 01:08:26.480]   Love that.
[01:08:26.480 --> 01:08:27.480]   That's great.
[01:08:27.480 --> 01:08:31.480]   I'm going to do an interview with a Methodist Church podcast next week.
[01:08:31.480 --> 01:08:35.480]   I listened to a number of Buddhist podcasts and religious podcasts.
[01:08:35.480 --> 01:08:40.480]   I think there are -- my wife is about to do a podcast.
[01:08:40.480 --> 01:08:42.480]   John, don't look at me like that.
[01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:45.480]   My wife is about to do a podcast where she talks -- she's a psychotherapist -- where she talks to people
[01:08:45.480 --> 01:08:47.480]   and just gets their life story.
[01:08:47.480 --> 01:08:50.480]   And you could do that in commercial radio.
[01:08:50.480 --> 01:08:54.480]   And yet, this is what's so great about podcasting is there's an explosion of content.
[01:08:54.480 --> 01:08:56.480]   Do they know they're being recorded?
[01:08:56.480 --> 01:08:57.480]   Yes.
[01:08:57.480 --> 01:08:58.480]   They will be knowing -- go ahead.
[01:08:58.480 --> 01:08:59.480]   Yes, sir.
[01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:01.480]   Michael Bosos gets to you there.
[01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:02.480]   Bosos knows.
[01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:10.480]   John Leo, what method would you recommend is the easiest way to do the RSS encoding for
[01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:13.480]   a program to make a real podcast?
[01:09:13.480 --> 01:09:19.480]   Well, the easiest way is to do what Kevin, for instance, does with dignity, which is to have a blog.
[01:09:19.480 --> 01:09:20.480]   What do you use?
[01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:21.480]   Use WordPress?
[01:09:21.480 --> 01:09:23.480]   No, actually, we're doing it all in-house now.
[01:09:23.480 --> 01:09:25.480]   But we're using Feedburner.
[01:09:25.480 --> 01:09:26.480]   Well, that's what I was saying.
[01:09:26.480 --> 01:09:28.480]   You had a blog with its own RSS feed.
[01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:31.480]   And Feedburner, if you give it the RSS feed, will take whatever enclosures are in there.
[01:09:31.480 --> 01:09:33.480]   And turn it into a podcast.
[01:09:33.480 --> 01:09:35.480]   So initially, that's how you did it, right?
[01:09:35.480 --> 01:09:38.480]   Yeah, actually, Typehead just announced that they're now doing the enclosures by default.
[01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:39.480]   So they're supporting podcasts.
[01:09:39.480 --> 01:09:41.480]   So you don't -- then you could do it without Feedburner on top.
[01:09:41.480 --> 01:09:42.480]   WordPress does as well.
[01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:43.480]   WordPress too.
[01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:48.480]   Does the Feedburner have the extra code in there for iTunes?
[01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:52.480]   Yeah, it actually has a place where you can just browse if you have album artwork that you want to put in there.
[01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:56.480]   You just browse, select the file, and it'll automatically put that into the feed for you.
[01:09:56.480 --> 01:10:01.480]   I was very jealous initially because I was struggling with the iTunes stuff.
[01:10:01.480 --> 01:10:04.480]   And Kevin's feed immediately was iTunes compatible.
[01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:05.480]   I was pissed.
[01:10:05.480 --> 01:10:07.480]   But it turned out it's because he was using Feedburner.
[01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:11.480]   What we do now is we hand and refer to it.
[01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:18.480]   In fact, for all my podcasts, I hand encode the RSS using a great program called Feeder,
[01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:21.480]   which is a Macintosh-only program that makes it very, very easy.
[01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:28.480]   What I found is that in the early days of RSS and podcasting, people would just -- it was kind of very basic.
[01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:32.480]   The enclosure, the location of the enclosure, maybe some simple descriptive stuff.
[01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:34.480]   What we do now is we put the whole show notes in there.
[01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:37.480]   When you get the RSS feed, you don't just get the sound.
[01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:39.480]   You get all the show notes.
[01:10:39.480 --> 01:10:40.480]   You get a lot of extra stuff.
[01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:45.480]   And I can do that now because I'm using Feeder so I can put the show notes into the RSS feed.
[01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:48.480]   I think podcasts are going to want to do that.
[01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:52.480]   I think they're going to want to make the feed be more than "Here's the audio."
[01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:53.480]   That's what I'm using too.
[01:10:53.480 --> 01:10:54.480]   You like Feeder?
[01:10:54.480 --> 01:10:54.480]   Yeah.
[01:10:54.480 --> 01:10:55.480]   Yeah.
[01:10:55.480 --> 01:10:56.480]   Dynamite.
[01:10:56.480 --> 01:10:56.480]   Yeah.
[01:10:56.480 --> 01:10:57.480]   What's the name of the --
[01:10:57.480 --> 01:11:02.480]   The John Hammond Show, it's a podcast version of my cable TV show.
[01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:04.480]   I've been doing it for 22 years in New York City.
[01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:05.480]   Oh, that's great.
[01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:06.480]   Yeah.
[01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:07.480]   What's the show about?
[01:11:07.480 --> 01:11:10.480]   It's a music, travel, and soft news.
[01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:11.480]   That's great.
[01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:12.480]   I stay away from the hard news.
[01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:13.480]   I leave there for CNN.
[01:11:13.480 --> 01:11:15.480]   That's exactly what this TV is about.
[01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:18.480]   Music, travel, and soft news.
[01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:19.480]   Next question.
[01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:20.480]   I mentioned that at something --
[01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:22.480]   Is that John Hammond.com?
[01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:27.480]   By the way, I'm John with No Hm, the organ player, accordion player.
[01:11:27.480 --> 01:11:31.480]   Remember local 802 Musicians Union and local 6 in San Francisco?
[01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:33.480]   Jam after the show.
[01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:35.480]   You bring the key to it.
[01:11:35.480 --> 01:11:37.480]   It goes right on, dude.
[01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:39.480]   And what's the URL for it, John?
[01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:40.480]   Yeah.
[01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:44.480]   You go to -- it's on iTunes and you go to www.jos.com.
[01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:53.480]   You go to www.jonhammondband.com/files/xml.
[01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:54.480]   Got it.
[01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:55.480]   Something like that.
[01:11:55.480 --> 01:11:56.480]   Yeah.
[01:11:56.480 --> 01:11:58.480]   AJ, did you have something you wanted to add?
[01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:02.480]   Yeah, there's actually a really expensive way of getting a podcast on the internet using
[01:12:02.480 --> 01:12:06.480]   .Mac and a piece of software called -- it's by real Mac software.
[01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:08.480]   It's called RapidWeaver.
[01:12:08.480 --> 01:12:09.480]   Oh, cool.
[01:12:09.480 --> 01:12:11.480]   And it allows you to create a web page using cascading-style sheets.
[01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:15.480]   And you can actually upload your MP3 online and it will automatically create a podcast
[01:12:15.480 --> 01:12:17.480]   like XML feed for you, which is pretty cool.
[01:12:17.480 --> 01:12:18.480]   That's really great.
[01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:20.480]   The only problem, of course, is if you get very popular, Apple is going to pull the
[01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:21.480]   plug on your .Mac account.
[01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:22.480]   Yeah, well, maybe.
[01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:24.480]   But that would be a good thing, right?
[01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:25.480]   Yeah.
[01:12:25.480 --> 01:12:27.480]   And .Mac is cheap and weaver is real cheap, so.
[01:12:27.480 --> 01:12:28.480]   I love .Mac.
[01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:29.480]   I think that's a great value.
[01:12:29.480 --> 01:12:31.480]   More questions from the -- thank you, AJ.
[01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:32.480]   More questions from the audience.
[01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:33.480]   Yes, sir.
[01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:34.480]   Go ahead, Matt.
[01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:36.480]   You can get to him in the back.
[01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:37.480]   Hi, yeah.
[01:12:37.480 --> 01:12:40.480]   Yahoo just recently did a sale on their domain names for $1.99 a year.
[01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:41.480]   That isn't amazing.
[01:12:41.480 --> 01:12:44.480]   Why do you think they did this position?
[01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:49.480]   Because recently, lately, it's been $10 a year.
[01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:51.480]   So why do you think they did this $1.99?
[01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:57.480]   The actual cost, I think, of going to the ICAM with a domain name, I think, is $3.50.
[01:12:57.480 --> 01:12:59.480]   So they're selling it at a loss there.
[01:12:59.480 --> 01:13:03.480]   But I talked to the two cows guys and I think that they said it was around $3.50.
[01:13:03.480 --> 01:13:04.480]   I heard $4.
[01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:06.480]   $4 is in that ballpark.
[01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:07.480]   Don't think that.
[01:13:07.480 --> 01:13:08.480]   You pay more than $4.
[01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:09.480]   You're overpaying.
[01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:11.480]   But it's all about the renewal, though.
[01:13:11.480 --> 01:13:12.480]   Yeah, I mean, like --
[01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:15.480]   But no, the Yahoo thing is you've got a five-year thing for what?
[01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:16.480]   $8, $20?
[01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:17.480]   $10 for five years.
[01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:18.480]   I didn't see the five years.
[01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:19.480]   That's an amazing deal.
[01:13:19.480 --> 01:13:21.480]   I don't know why they're doing it because they want to --
[01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:22.480]   What?
[01:13:22.480 --> 01:13:23.480]   They want to sell you more services.
[01:13:23.480 --> 01:13:24.480]   Yeah.
[01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:26.480]   It's a loss leader who sell you more services.
[01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:27.480]   Yeah.
[01:13:27.480 --> 01:13:28.480]   That makes a lot of sense.
[01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:29.480]   Take advantage of it.
[01:13:29.480 --> 01:13:30.480]   Yeah, why not?
[01:13:30.480 --> 01:13:31.480]   Yeah.
[01:13:31.480 --> 01:13:32.480]   Yeah, do some squatting.
[01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:33.480]   Go ahead.
[01:13:33.480 --> 01:13:35.480]   Just run to somebody with their hand up, Matt.
[01:13:35.480 --> 01:13:36.480]   You can't go that far.
[01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:37.480]   Well, maybe you can.
[01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:38.480]   This will be really --
[01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:41.480]   Earlier, those of you listening at home don't know this, but earlier,
[01:13:41.480 --> 01:13:44.480]   I stepped on the power supply and unplugged everything.
[01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:46.480]   Maybe you did notice when they hear that giant --
[01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:48.480]   [Laughter]
[01:13:48.480 --> 01:13:50.480]   I can't wait to go home and listen to it.
[01:13:50.480 --> 01:13:52.480]   I don't know what it's going to sound like.
[01:13:52.480 --> 01:13:53.480]   It'll be in the video version.
[01:13:53.480 --> 01:13:54.480]   Yeah.
[01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:55.480]   We'll see you trip over.
[01:13:55.480 --> 01:13:57.480]   Yeah, the video version will have what happened.
[01:13:57.480 --> 01:13:58.480]   That'll be the highlight.
[01:13:58.480 --> 01:14:00.480]   The audio version won't because all you -- it went dead.
[01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:02.480]   [Laughter]
[01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:03.480]   Yes, sir.
[01:14:03.480 --> 01:14:04.480]   Hey, how you guys doing?
[01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:07.480]   I was wondering, where do you guys see PowerPC going in desktops
[01:14:07.480 --> 01:14:09.480]   after Apple drops the processor?
[01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:11.480]   Apple just ordered a bunch of new chips, didn't they?
[01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:13.480]   What is that all about?
[01:14:13.480 --> 01:14:14.480]   They actually conserved them.
[01:14:14.480 --> 01:14:16.480]   They reserved more PowerPCs.
[01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:18.480]   They don't have to sell them.
[01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:20.480]   I think it's dead.
[01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:22.480]   [Laughter]
[01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:23.480]   A little bit more open.
[01:14:23.480 --> 01:14:25.480]   Kevin, where is hacking with Ramsey at?
[01:14:25.480 --> 01:14:26.480]   When is he coming back?
[01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:28.480]   Ramsey actually, he lives here in San Francisco.
[01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:30.480]   He'll be doing another episode of The Broken with us here in the
[01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:31.480]   next couple months.
[01:14:31.480 --> 01:14:33.480]   The Broken is back and so is Ramsey.
[01:14:33.480 --> 01:14:34.480]   That's right.
[01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:35.480]   People love Ramsey.
[01:14:35.480 --> 01:14:38.480]   Do you see that massage or something like that?
[01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:39.480]   Yeah, he's from Jordan.
[01:14:39.480 --> 01:14:41.480]   He's an awesome little hacker guy.
[01:14:41.480 --> 01:14:43.480]   Awesome little hacker guy.
[01:14:43.480 --> 01:14:45.480]   He loves to hack.
[01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:47.480]   This thing on.
[01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:48.480]   Okay, good.
[01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:49.480]   Hi, my name is Chris White.
[01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:52.480]   I'm actually a Gen 2 developer, so thanks for mentioning that.
[01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:53.480]   Love Gen 2.
[01:14:53.480 --> 01:14:54.480]   Thank you.
[01:14:54.480 --> 01:14:55.480]   I love working on it.
[01:14:55.480 --> 01:14:57.480]   The question I wanted to ask you is you're mentioning patents
[01:14:57.480 --> 01:14:58.480]   and whatnot.
[01:14:58.480 --> 01:14:59.480]   Two comments on that.
[01:14:59.480 --> 01:15:01.480]   Number one, I found that there was a very interesting patent
[01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:03.480]   that was put out in the net about something that was put out
[01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:07.480]   in the net about someone who actually, they patented the
[01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:11.480]   Tarzan swing along with the Tarzan yell.
[01:15:11.480 --> 01:15:13.480]   So if I do that, I could get sued.
[01:15:13.480 --> 01:15:16.480]   I don't know how they enforce it, but I saw this online somewhere.
[01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:19.480]   The other comment I wanted to make too was what are you guys'
[01:15:19.480 --> 01:15:22.480]   opinions on the recent, I think Intel's, or the Microsoft
[01:15:22.480 --> 01:15:25.480]   developers conference somewhere, they were talking about
[01:15:25.480 --> 01:15:28.480]   digital rights management through the actual hardware itself.
[01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:32.480]   And then if you try to play, I guess if you're trying to play
[01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:35.480]   like an illegal file or something, it wouldn't let you do it.
[01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:36.480]   That's TPM, yeah.
[01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:38.480]   Which, in general, opinion on that.
[01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:39.480]   Sounds like a bad idea.
[01:15:39.480 --> 01:15:40.480]   Yeah.
[01:15:40.480 --> 01:15:43.480]   Well, and that was the whole Fuhrer over Apple putting TPM into
[01:15:43.480 --> 01:15:46.480]   the developer box, which we never confirmed that they were doing.
[01:15:46.480 --> 01:15:47.480]   And that kind of blew over.
[01:15:47.480 --> 01:15:48.480]   That blew Ray.
[01:15:48.480 --> 01:15:50.480]   You're looking at the same situation where with
[01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:52.480]   updateable cryptography.
[01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:54.480]   Well, they learned CSS was a flop.
[01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:57.480]   In addition to, if you put a disk in that's not authorized,
[01:15:57.480 --> 01:16:00.480]   they could just as easily disable entire player.
[01:16:00.480 --> 01:16:02.480]   So.
[01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:04.480]   You know, I'll tell you, I'll give you a really good example of
[01:16:04.480 --> 01:16:06.480]   where this reaches into your computer and it's a little too
[01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:07.480]   much.
[01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:08.480]   Electronic Arts.
[01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:12.480]   If you ever installed alcohol on 20% or clone CD, which are
[01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:15.480]   two programs that allow you to crack games, but also put
[01:16:15.480 --> 01:16:19.480]   drivers on your system so that you can mount CD images, right?
[01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:21.480]   And I do that all the time because I have a spindle-less
[01:16:21.480 --> 01:16:22.480]   laptop.
[01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:26.480]   So I'll copy a CD, put the image on there so I can mount it.
[01:16:26.480 --> 01:16:29.480]   If, I think it's Medal of Honor, a couple of electronic arts
[01:16:29.480 --> 01:16:33.480]   games, if Doom 3 see that driver on there, they refuse to let
[01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:34.480]   you play the game.
[01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:37.480]   They presume that you wouldn't have that on there unless you
[01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:39.480]   were a thief and about to steal their program.
[01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:41.480]   It's like having a cantina.
[01:16:41.480 --> 01:16:42.480]   Yeah.
[01:16:42.480 --> 01:16:43.480]   It's like having a cantina.
[01:16:43.480 --> 01:16:44.480]   I mean, I've ran into it.
[01:16:44.480 --> 01:16:45.480]   I'm appalled by that.
[01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:46.480]   Do you think you've seen that before?
[01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:47.480]   It's annoying as it can be.
[01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:48.480]   I think it's more than annoying.
[01:16:48.480 --> 01:16:50.480]   It's not their business when I'm running on my computer.
[01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:52.480]   And nine times out of ten, whenever you're patching a game,
[01:16:52.480 --> 01:16:54.480]   if it's a relatively small patch, you don't see really what
[01:16:54.480 --> 01:16:55.480]   the heck they did.
[01:16:55.480 --> 01:16:58.480]   Odds are, it's just an update for that copy protection scheme.
[01:16:58.480 --> 01:16:59.480]   To put it in.
[01:16:59.480 --> 01:17:01.480]   That's going to re-say, like there's a back and forth game
[01:17:01.480 --> 01:17:03.480]   between the people like all hundred and one percent.
[01:17:03.480 --> 01:17:04.480]   Because they crack it to make a work run.
[01:17:04.480 --> 01:17:06.480]   Get us off the black list and then they turn around and release
[01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:09.480]   a patch that updates the security on the disk that was shipped
[01:17:09.480 --> 01:17:11.480]   to go ahead and re-black list them.
[01:17:11.480 --> 01:17:13.480]   And you go back, I'm seeing it less on some of the new titles.
[01:17:13.480 --> 01:17:16.480]   Either that or they finally just given up on it.
[01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:19.480]   But for a good year there, every new game you had, especially the
[01:17:19.480 --> 01:17:22.480]   ones with, I want to say Star Force or it was one of the
[01:17:22.480 --> 01:17:23.480]   two major--
[01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:25.480]   I think it turns people into pirates.
[01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:26.480]   I told the guy--
[01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:27.480]   Yeah, I agree.
[01:17:27.480 --> 01:17:29.480]   This happened to, well sure, no problem.
[01:17:29.480 --> 01:17:33.480]   Just go get a crack and take that code out of yourself.
[01:17:33.480 --> 01:17:36.480]   It's turning, it's forcing legitimate users, Guy paid 80 bucks
[01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:39.480]   for these games, can't play them because he wants to install
[01:17:39.480 --> 01:17:42.480]   Clones CD uninstalled but the driver doesn't go away because
[01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:44.480]   they think, well, maybe you're still going to mount these
[01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:46.480]   disks and he can't play the game.
[01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:48.480]   And I said, well, here's how you get a crack.
[01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:49.480]   It's turning people into pirates.
[01:17:49.480 --> 01:17:51.480]   TPM will do the same thing.
[01:17:51.480 --> 01:17:53.480]   It's a bad.
[01:17:53.480 --> 01:17:54.480]   Can you elaborate?
[01:17:54.480 --> 01:17:56.480]   I just say, what can I say?
[01:17:56.480 --> 01:17:57.480]   It's a bad idea.
[01:17:57.480 --> 01:17:58.480]   It sucks.
[01:17:58.480 --> 01:17:59.480]   How's that?
[01:17:59.480 --> 01:18:00.480]   There you go, that's a lot.
[01:18:00.480 --> 01:18:02.480]   What were those DVDs that used to evaporate or what?
[01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:03.480]   DiPix, perfect.
[01:18:03.480 --> 01:18:04.480]   DiPix.
[01:18:04.480 --> 01:18:05.480]   The original do it.
[01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:07.480]   Some DVD should evaporate.
[01:18:07.480 --> 01:18:08.480]   Yeah.
[01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:12.480]   Let's get the gentleman in the UCSD t-shirt.
[01:18:12.480 --> 01:18:15.480]   I have a question for Kevin.
[01:18:15.480 --> 01:18:18.480]   Did G4 fire you or did you resign?
[01:18:18.480 --> 01:18:20.480]   No, I resigned.
[01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:24.480]   They actually, there was about, gosh, about 30 days there
[01:18:24.480 --> 01:18:26.480]   where I was trying to get on my contract.
[01:18:26.480 --> 01:18:29.480]   And I went into Peter Green who was in charge of programming
[01:18:29.480 --> 01:18:32.480]   there at G4 and sat down with him and said, I really want out.
[01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:34.480]   I want to do my own thing.
[01:18:34.480 --> 01:18:36.480]   And thankfully they released me.
[01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:39.480]   Otherwise, I wouldn't be able to do what we do with revision three
[01:18:39.480 --> 01:18:41.480]   because I signed a three-year deal with them.
[01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:43.480]   I'll vouch for that because he was so happy.
[01:18:43.480 --> 01:18:44.480]   Yeah, right.
[01:18:44.480 --> 01:18:45.480]   I remember what he told me.
[01:18:45.480 --> 01:18:47.480]   I was like, I don't know, man.
[01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:48.480]   G4 sucked.
[01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:50.480]   There was a point where...
[01:18:50.480 --> 01:18:55.480]   I don't know, that's going to go over big with the podcast.
[01:18:55.480 --> 01:18:56.480]   Yeah.
[01:18:56.480 --> 01:18:58.480]   I'm sure to keep that on the tape.
[01:18:58.480 --> 01:19:02.480]   Well, the only person here who would be hurt by that is me
[01:19:02.480 --> 01:19:05.480]   because I have a show on G4, but I don't care.
[01:19:05.480 --> 01:19:06.480]   I agree.
[01:19:06.480 --> 01:19:07.480]   Oh, well, you can take it out of it.
[01:19:07.480 --> 01:19:08.480]   You're going to take it out.
[01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:09.480]   What's that?
[01:19:09.480 --> 01:19:10.480]   Kevin's on call for help too.
[01:19:10.480 --> 01:19:13.480]   It's really weird because I'm back on G4 now because I'm on your show.
[01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:16.480]   But without a contract, Leo didn't make me a second.
[01:19:16.480 --> 01:19:21.480]   I'm thinking about it though.
[01:19:21.480 --> 01:19:22.480]   I'm thinking about it though.
[01:19:22.480 --> 01:19:24.480]   Five, six years.
[01:19:24.480 --> 01:19:26.480]   Lock them down.
[01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:27.480]   No, no.
[01:19:27.480 --> 01:19:31.480]   Yeah, tech TV lives on in a weird way, doesn't it?
[01:19:31.480 --> 01:19:32.480]   It just refuses to die.
[01:19:32.480 --> 01:19:35.480]   We're the living proof of that.
[01:19:35.480 --> 01:19:38.480]   But I think it lives on because, not because of us, but because
[01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:41.480]   the viewers wouldn't let it die, basically.
[01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:44.480]   I mean, it would be long gone if people didn't want it back.
[01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:48.480]   It had a bigger market than G4 gave it credit for.
[01:19:48.480 --> 01:19:50.480]   That's why I think that's why call for help is back on G4s.
[01:19:50.480 --> 01:19:54.480]   They're saying, hmm, even if it is in the 8 a.m. on the Pacific coast.
[01:19:54.480 --> 01:19:56.480]   Go ahead and just pick somebody else, Matt.
[01:19:56.480 --> 01:20:00.480]   Along those same lines, do any of you guys who aren't on any
[01:20:00.480 --> 01:20:02.480]   networks anymore, what do you miss about it?
[01:20:02.480 --> 01:20:05.480]   And the other thing, have you guys seen the Asteroids fossil
[01:20:05.480 --> 01:20:06.480]   watch thing as false?
[01:20:06.480 --> 01:20:07.480]   Oh, yeah.
[01:20:07.480 --> 01:20:08.480]   I have one of those.
[01:20:08.480 --> 01:20:10.480]   Does it actually play or does it just do Asteroids in the back?
[01:20:10.480 --> 01:20:11.480]   It plays itself.
[01:20:11.480 --> 01:20:12.480]   But you can't play it.
[01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:15.480]   No, I wish it could, but the watch would be as big as me if that
[01:20:15.480 --> 01:20:16.480]   were the case.
[01:20:16.480 --> 01:20:17.480]   I don't think so.
[01:20:17.480 --> 01:20:20.480]   You could probably make Asteroids in a size that small, but yeah.
[01:20:20.480 --> 01:20:21.480]   Bet you anything you could.
[01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:24.480]   I mean, there's an Asteroids widget for the dashboard widget.
[01:20:24.480 --> 01:20:26.480]   Is there a Palm Pilot Asteroids version?
[01:20:26.480 --> 01:20:27.480]   Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[01:20:27.480 --> 01:20:28.480]   Could be used in the Palm Pilot watch.
[01:20:28.480 --> 01:20:29.480]   There you go, see?
[01:20:29.480 --> 01:20:30.480]   There you go.
[01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:31.480]   You can play it on your Palm Pilot watch.
[01:20:31.480 --> 01:20:32.480]   All right, Lou.
[01:20:32.480 --> 01:20:33.480]   More questions?
[01:20:33.480 --> 01:20:34.480]   Anybody else?
[01:20:34.480 --> 01:20:36.480]   Actually, to answer that question, though, I know Leo and I
[01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:39.480]   miss, like, there's a pure, vibrant, nasty adrenaline rush.
[01:20:39.480 --> 01:20:40.480]   You get out of making live TV.
[01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:41.480]   That's why we're doing this part.
[01:20:41.480 --> 01:20:42.480]   Yeah.
[01:20:42.480 --> 01:20:43.480]   No, seriously.
[01:20:43.480 --> 01:20:45.480]   I mean, there's one thing for Patrick and me to sit sweating
[01:20:45.480 --> 01:20:47.480]   in my attic office with everybody else on Skype.
[01:20:47.480 --> 01:20:48.480]   That was all right.
[01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:50.480]   But this is so much better, don't you think?
[01:20:50.480 --> 01:20:51.480]   We like doing live TV.
[01:20:51.480 --> 01:20:53.480]   There was nothing like doing that.
[01:20:53.480 --> 01:20:56.480]   There's a tremendous group of people at Tech TV.
[01:20:56.480 --> 01:20:59.480]   More talent came in and out the door than probably anywhere else
[01:20:59.480 --> 01:21:00.480]   for level work.
[01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:01.480]   I miss that, too.
[01:21:01.480 --> 01:21:04.480]   One of the things I hope we will do with Twit in our live
[01:21:04.480 --> 01:21:07.480]   venues, we're just going to say to all of those old Tech TV people,
[01:21:07.480 --> 01:21:10.480]   you know, we're in Larkspur landing every Sunday afternoon.
[01:21:10.480 --> 01:21:14.480]   Come by, there's a place, a chair for you, a glass of bourbon.
[01:21:14.480 --> 01:21:15.480]   Have a seat.
[01:21:15.480 --> 01:21:17.480]   We'll get Bordeaux for John.
[01:21:17.480 --> 01:21:18.480]   Black coffee for you, Patrick.
[01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:19.480]   Appreciate it.
[01:21:19.480 --> 01:21:20.480]   White wine for Dave.
[01:21:20.480 --> 01:21:21.480]   Roger, what would you like?
[01:21:21.480 --> 01:21:22.480]   I like some Chardonnay.
[01:21:22.480 --> 01:21:24.480]   Chardonnay, okay.
[01:21:24.480 --> 01:21:27.480]   Any other questions or we're going to wrap this?
[01:21:27.480 --> 01:21:30.480]   Okay, I kind of have to work your way to the side here because
[01:21:30.480 --> 01:21:33.480]   Mac can only go so far with our microphones.
[01:21:33.480 --> 01:21:35.480]   So a couple of things I'm going to make some notes.
[01:21:35.480 --> 01:21:37.480]   I need longer mic cables.
[01:21:37.480 --> 01:21:38.480]   Wireless.
[01:21:38.480 --> 01:21:40.480]   Wireless for the audience.
[01:21:40.480 --> 01:21:41.480]   Good wireless.
[01:21:41.480 --> 01:21:42.480]   Okay.
[01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:46.480]   And I need a power supply I can't step on.
[01:21:46.480 --> 01:21:47.480]   Pizza tape around it.
[01:21:47.480 --> 01:21:50.480]   Yeah, if I would just sit down and I would be fine, I just can't sit down.
[01:21:50.480 --> 01:21:51.480]   Yeah, go ahead.
[01:21:51.480 --> 01:21:52.480]   Quick question.
[01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:56.480]   I just want to know is there going to be any element of estrogen on this?
[01:21:56.480 --> 01:21:57.480]   Yes.
[01:21:57.480 --> 01:22:01.480]   You know, we invite, we've had like Megan Moroni, who tried to get her on
[01:22:01.480 --> 01:22:03.480]   Gina Smith was supposed to be on this week.
[01:22:03.480 --> 01:22:05.480]   If the women had a little more.
[01:22:05.480 --> 01:22:06.480]   No, you know what the problem is?
[01:22:06.480 --> 01:22:08.480]   No, no, no, you know what the problem is?
[01:22:08.480 --> 01:22:09.480]   They all have babies.
[01:22:09.480 --> 01:22:12.480]   So Megan has twin boys and it's hard for her to get away, but she
[01:22:12.480 --> 01:22:15.480]   swears, she promises, she's dying to do it and and and Gina Smith
[01:22:15.480 --> 01:22:18.480]   was going to be here and her son, her two year old Eric, has the flu.
[01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:21.480]   So she couldn't make it today, but she will probably be on the next
[01:22:21.480 --> 01:22:22.480]   Twitcast.
[01:22:22.480 --> 01:22:26.480]   And I've invited Kate, Patelo many times.
[01:22:26.480 --> 01:22:27.480]   You haven't heard from her.
[01:22:27.480 --> 01:22:29.480]   She lives in New York and that's the problem.
[01:22:29.480 --> 01:22:30.480]   But absolutely.
[01:22:30.480 --> 01:22:32.480]   I mean, I don't want it to be a voice problem.
[01:22:32.480 --> 01:22:33.480]   Yeah, no, that's not a problem.
[01:22:33.480 --> 01:22:34.480]   We would love to have some women.
[01:22:34.480 --> 01:22:35.480]   Jessica will be back.
[01:22:35.480 --> 01:22:39.480]   That's just, you know, five weenies and whatever I said in that
[01:22:39.480 --> 01:22:40.480]   posting.
[01:22:40.480 --> 01:22:41.480]   What did you say?
[01:22:41.480 --> 01:22:43.480]   I think the show consists of five blow hearts and a weenie.
[01:22:43.480 --> 01:22:45.480]   And you're not going to identify the weenie?
[01:22:45.480 --> 01:22:46.480]   Of course not.
[01:22:46.480 --> 01:22:50.480]   So we'd like to have some female blow hearts too.
[01:22:50.480 --> 01:22:53.480]   Yeah, well, you can't have a female weenie or could you?
[01:22:53.480 --> 01:22:54.480]   I'm out of here.
[01:22:54.480 --> 01:22:55.480]   I'll edit that part out.
[01:22:55.480 --> 01:22:56.480]   Go ahead.
[01:22:56.480 --> 01:22:57.480]   Good call.
[01:22:57.480 --> 01:22:58.480]   Another question.
[01:22:58.480 --> 01:22:59.480]   Yeah, hi.
[01:22:59.480 --> 01:23:02.480]   I just wanted to ask a question about privacy issues.
[01:23:02.480 --> 01:23:06.480]   I'm into genealogy and I'm always looking up dead people and I
[01:23:06.480 --> 01:23:08.480]   happen to look up live people.
[01:23:08.480 --> 01:23:13.480]   And to my surprise, I can find online unprotected my birthday,
[01:23:13.480 --> 01:23:15.480]   my mother's maiden name and everything.
[01:23:15.480 --> 01:23:16.480]   My home address.
[01:23:16.480 --> 01:23:18.480]   Your home address, everything.
[01:23:18.480 --> 01:23:21.480]   And so this is what my bank and my credit card asked me to
[01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:22.480]   protect my account.
[01:23:22.480 --> 01:23:25.480]   So what do you suggest we do?
[01:23:25.480 --> 01:23:27.480]   I mean, I'm safe.
[01:23:27.480 --> 01:23:28.480]   I got married.
[01:23:28.480 --> 01:23:29.480]   They can't find me.
[01:23:29.480 --> 01:23:31.480]   But you guys, you know, they will find me.
[01:23:31.480 --> 01:23:33.480]   I don't have a suggestion.
[01:23:33.480 --> 01:23:35.480]   I think the problem is, is stuff is public.
[01:23:35.480 --> 01:23:36.480]   Yeah.
[01:23:36.480 --> 01:23:37.480]   I move frequently.
[01:23:37.480 --> 01:23:38.480]   Yeah.
[01:23:38.480 --> 01:23:39.480]   Changing an address.
[01:23:39.480 --> 01:23:41.480]   Three or four times in one year helps a lot.
[01:23:41.480 --> 01:23:45.480]   If you didn't buy, the problem is you're involved yourself in
[01:23:45.480 --> 01:23:46.480]   the economy.
[01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:49.480]   If you didn't buy a house, if you didn't have a credit card,
[01:23:49.480 --> 01:23:51.480]   if you had no, if you don't vote, if you don't have a data
[01:23:51.480 --> 01:23:53.480]   trail, you were invisible.
[01:23:53.480 --> 01:23:55.480]   But I mean, we all want to live in the economy.
[01:23:55.480 --> 01:23:58.480]   But this is being put out by official records from what state
[01:23:58.480 --> 01:24:00.480]   of California, by a record from the various.
[01:24:00.480 --> 01:24:04.480]   Remember that for years, county records and for good reason
[01:24:04.480 --> 01:24:07.480]   were made public, but you had to go to the county cornhouse to
[01:24:07.480 --> 01:24:08.480]   see them.
[01:24:08.480 --> 01:24:09.480]   Well, now those records are online.
[01:24:09.480 --> 01:24:11.480]   And I think that probably the best thing to do is to go to your
[01:24:11.480 --> 01:24:16.480]   state legislature and say, we -- and this happened with Teresa
[01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:20.480]   Saldana case where she's an actress who was salted by a
[01:24:20.480 --> 01:24:23.480]   stalker who found her home information in DMV records that
[01:24:23.480 --> 01:24:24.480]   were online.
[01:24:24.480 --> 01:24:27.480]   At that time, the state of California yanked those DMV
[01:24:27.480 --> 01:24:28.480]   records.
[01:24:28.480 --> 01:24:31.480]   And so they need to do the same for other local records.
[01:24:31.480 --> 01:24:33.480]   But right now, that's who has to do something about it.
[01:24:33.480 --> 01:24:37.480]   You cannot protect yourself because those things are public
[01:24:37.480 --> 01:24:38.480]   records.
[01:24:38.480 --> 01:24:39.480]   You know what?
[01:24:39.480 --> 01:24:41.480]   We just bought a house and I get in the mail every day
[01:24:41.480 --> 01:24:44.480]   solicitations to refinance my house with the exact amount I
[01:24:44.480 --> 01:24:45.480]   paid for the house.
[01:24:45.480 --> 01:24:47.480]   You have a bull's on your forehead as soon as you buy a
[01:24:47.480 --> 01:24:48.480]   house nowadays.
[01:24:48.480 --> 01:24:51.480]   Have a baby and you start every year now that my child has a
[01:24:51.480 --> 01:24:54.480]   birthday, a male, a good junk male from people that the
[01:24:54.480 --> 01:24:57.480]   hospital sold my information to.
[01:24:57.480 --> 01:24:59.480]   So it's very hard to protect yourself.
[01:24:59.480 --> 01:25:01.480]   And I think that really that's the only people that can do
[01:25:01.480 --> 01:25:02.480]   anything about it.
[01:25:02.480 --> 01:25:05.480]   >> There's a long tradition of people walking into the DMV
[01:25:05.480 --> 01:25:08.480]   office with a $100 bill and a plate number going through
[01:25:08.480 --> 01:25:09.480]   former police officers.
[01:25:09.480 --> 01:25:10.480]   >> You can always get it.
[01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:12.480]   >> It doesn't cost 100 bucks anymore.
[01:25:12.480 --> 01:25:13.480]   >> Yeah, you know, online.
[01:25:13.480 --> 01:25:14.480]   >> Always get that.
[01:25:14.480 --> 01:25:16.480]   >> There's full rundown just about anybody.
[01:25:16.480 --> 01:25:17.480]   >> It's a shame.
[01:25:17.480 --> 01:25:19.480]   >> There's a nasty side to the whole information that wants to
[01:25:19.480 --> 01:25:20.480]   be free.
[01:25:20.480 --> 01:25:22.480]   And the flip side is information is a very interesting
[01:25:22.480 --> 01:25:23.480]   habit of following.
[01:25:23.480 --> 01:25:25.480]   If there's money, the information's out there.
[01:25:25.480 --> 01:25:27.480]   >> You can move, you can chase your phone number.
[01:25:27.480 --> 01:25:30.480]   Basically without dropping out of society and going to a
[01:25:30.480 --> 01:25:33.480]   barter system, moving to Baja and checking off the grid,
[01:25:33.480 --> 01:25:35.480]   your information's out there.
[01:25:35.480 --> 01:25:38.480]   >> Human rates is a really interesting point though because
[01:25:38.480 --> 01:25:41.480]   that is the flip side of the thing that we celebrate so much
[01:25:41.480 --> 01:25:43.480]   is that information wants to be free.
[01:25:43.480 --> 01:25:44.480]   Music wants to get out there.
[01:25:44.480 --> 01:25:47.480]   This stuff, the podcast, the video wants to get out there and
[01:25:47.480 --> 01:25:48.480]   spread itself.
[01:25:48.480 --> 01:25:51.480]   Information doesn't discriminate between your personal
[01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:53.480]   information and anything else.
[01:25:53.480 --> 01:25:54.480]   All of it wants to be free.
[01:25:54.480 --> 01:25:57.480]   This is the flip side of the technology.
[01:25:57.480 --> 01:25:59.480]   >> There needs to be some legislation.
[01:25:59.480 --> 01:26:00.480]   That's what needs to happen.
[01:26:00.480 --> 01:26:01.480]   >> I think it's the only way, frankly.
[01:26:01.480 --> 01:26:04.480]   You can't trust the government to do the right thing in this case.
[01:26:04.480 --> 01:26:05.480]   Can you?
[01:26:05.480 --> 01:26:07.480]   >> All these jerks that are in there and put some --
[01:26:07.480 --> 01:26:10.480]   >> Commercial interests want this information.
[01:26:10.480 --> 01:26:12.480]   >> It really needs to be an opt-in system.
[01:26:12.480 --> 01:26:13.480]   Unless you say otherwise.
[01:26:13.480 --> 01:26:15.480]   >> One final comment.
[01:26:15.480 --> 01:26:18.480]   >> Next time for your next free broadcast.
[01:26:18.480 --> 01:26:23.480]   Why don't you solicit duct tape so you can tape down all of
[01:26:23.480 --> 01:26:24.480]   the records.
[01:26:24.480 --> 01:26:26.480]   >> You should see this.
[01:26:26.480 --> 01:26:29.480]   You will if you watch the video version of it.
[01:26:29.480 --> 01:26:31.480]   It's all carefully designed.
[01:26:31.480 --> 01:26:34.480]   >> All of us at work at tech TV have tons of gaffers tape.
[01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:36.480]   >> That's where it's all handy.
[01:26:36.480 --> 01:26:41.480]   >> I have a pledge to keep this podcast down to CD length.
[01:26:41.480 --> 01:26:43.480]   We've already exceeded that.
[01:26:43.480 --> 01:26:47.480]   I'm trying to keep it down to 2 CD length for this particular
[01:26:47.480 --> 01:26:50.480]   podcast so that we can make -- what we'll do is we'll split it
[01:26:50.480 --> 01:26:55.480]   up to a half and we'll have a two hour ten minute version.
[01:26:55.480 --> 01:26:58.480]   How many of you just add a curiosity?
[01:26:58.480 --> 01:27:02.480]   How many of you listen to the podcast on your computer?
[01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:03.480]   Most of you.
[01:27:03.480 --> 01:27:06.480]   How many of you listen to it on portable devices?
[01:27:06.480 --> 01:27:07.480]   About an equal number.
[01:27:07.480 --> 01:27:10.480]   How many of you burn it to a CD?
[01:27:10.480 --> 01:27:11.480]   Just a few.
[01:27:11.480 --> 01:27:12.480]   A handful.
[01:27:12.480 --> 01:27:14.480]   Those are the ones we're doing that for.
[01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:15.480]   >> Forget it.
[01:27:15.480 --> 01:27:19.480]   Obviously it's not an existing market.
[01:27:19.480 --> 01:27:21.480]   >> Well, I think it's a nice thing to do.
[01:27:21.480 --> 01:27:22.480]   I don't know.
[01:27:22.480 --> 01:27:24.480]   How many of you listen to the mp3 version?
[01:27:24.480 --> 01:27:26.480]   Aac version.
[01:27:26.480 --> 01:27:29.480]   Aug version.
[01:27:29.480 --> 01:27:30.480]   >> Yeah.
[01:27:30.480 --> 01:27:31.480]   >> Yeah.
[01:27:31.480 --> 01:27:32.480]   >> Yeah.
[01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:33.480]   >> Yeah.
[01:27:33.480 --> 01:27:34.480]   >> Yeah.
[01:27:34.480 --> 01:27:35.480]   >> Yeah.
[01:27:35.480 --> 01:27:36.480]   >> Yeah.
[01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:37.480]   >> Yeah.
[01:27:37.480 --> 01:27:38.480]   >> Yeah.
[01:27:38.480 --> 01:27:39.480]   >> Yeah.
[01:27:39.480 --> 01:27:40.480]   >> Yeah.
[01:27:40.480 --> 01:27:41.480]   >> Yeah.
[01:27:41.480 --> 01:27:42.480]   >> Yeah.
[01:27:42.480 --> 01:27:43.480]   >> Yeah.
[01:27:43.480 --> 01:27:44.480]   >> Yeah.
[01:27:44.480 --> 01:27:45.480]   >> Yeah.
[01:27:45.480 --> 01:27:46.480]   >> Yeah.
[01:27:46.480 --> 01:27:47.480]   >> Yeah.
[01:27:47.480 --> 01:27:48.480]   >> Yeah.
[01:27:48.480 --> 01:27:53.480]   >> So how many of you listen to the 32 kilobits or the lower version or would like an even lower quality version?
[01:27:53.480 --> 01:27:54.480]   You like the high quality version?
[01:27:54.480 --> 01:27:55.480]   >> Yeah.
[01:27:55.480 --> 01:27:58.480]   >> Most people have enough bandwidth that they can download the high quality version.
[01:27:58.480 --> 01:28:06.480]   Finally, if we were to create a merchandising store at, let's say, Think Geek with t-shirts, mug sweatshirts,
[01:28:06.480 --> 01:28:10.480]   patent Norton masks, would you buy merchandise?
[01:28:10.480 --> 01:28:11.480]   All right.
[01:28:11.480 --> 01:28:13.480]   >> Put the guitar on there too.
[01:28:13.480 --> 01:28:15.480]   >> I'd like to thank Roger McQuinn for being here.
[01:28:15.480 --> 01:28:16.480]   It was so great to have him.
[01:28:16.480 --> 01:28:18.480]   >> Thank you for having me.
[01:28:18.480 --> 01:28:19.480]   >> Just a real thrill.
[01:28:19.480 --> 01:28:20.480]   >> Just a real pleasure.
[01:28:20.480 --> 01:28:22.480]   >> Patrick, you've got to give back to guitar now.
[01:28:22.480 --> 01:28:23.480]   I'm sorry.
[01:28:23.480 --> 01:28:25.480]   Patrick's been like Elvis for most of this podcast.
[01:28:25.480 --> 01:28:27.480]   He's been holding the guitar.
[01:28:27.480 --> 01:28:28.480]   Not playing it, just holding it.
[01:28:28.480 --> 01:28:30.480]   >> Yeah, running scales.
[01:28:30.480 --> 01:28:33.480]   >> Patrick is on TV again on the Internet.
[01:28:33.480 --> 01:28:35.480]   Digitallifetv.com.
[01:28:35.480 --> 01:28:36.480]   >> Dot com.
[01:28:36.480 --> 01:28:42.480]   David Prager is, of course, working for System and Revision 3, putting out more IPTV with Kevin Rose.
[01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:46.480]   The great Robert Herron is available at PC Magazine.com.
[01:28:46.480 --> 01:28:48.480]   He's their HDTV King.
[01:28:48.480 --> 01:28:50.480]   Kevin Rose, you want to tell us anything about what you're up to?
[01:28:50.480 --> 01:28:52.480]   I know you've got a lot of projects.
[01:28:52.480 --> 01:28:54.480]   >> Mostly trying to scale Dig right now.
[01:28:54.480 --> 01:28:55.480]   Dig is really taking off.
[01:28:55.480 --> 01:28:57.480]   Dig is amazing.
[01:28:57.480 --> 01:28:58.480]   D-I-G-G.com.
[01:28:58.480 --> 01:29:03.480]   We've got to work out a way that I can get you the show notes so that you have them on Dig.
[01:29:03.480 --> 01:29:05.480]   We'll figure this out.
[01:29:05.480 --> 01:29:07.480]   Right now, it goes out at the same time.
[01:29:07.480 --> 01:29:10.480]   You can always get it off the website, but you probably want it ahead of time.
[01:29:10.480 --> 01:29:11.480]   >> Yeah, we'll figure it out.
[01:29:11.480 --> 01:29:12.480]   >> Yeah.
[01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:14.480]   >> John C. Devorak at Devorak.org/blog.
[01:29:14.480 --> 01:29:18.480]   >> PC Magazine, Market Watch, here and there.
[01:29:18.480 --> 01:29:20.480]   >> It's like Devorak.org/blog.
[01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:22.480]   We'll link to those other things.
[01:29:22.480 --> 01:29:25.480]   >> And ladies and gentlemen, does John get any spam?
[01:29:25.480 --> 01:29:26.480]   >> No.
[01:29:26.480 --> 01:29:27.480]   >> No spam.
[01:29:27.480 --> 01:29:30.480]   John, I get no spam, Devorak.
[01:29:30.480 --> 01:29:33.480]   And I want to introduce somebody who we haven't talked to yet.
[01:29:33.480 --> 01:29:37.480]   Ashley, I call him Ashley Twitt, Ashley Witt, who is a composer.
[01:29:37.480 --> 01:29:40.480]   He's done music for many movies you've seen.
[01:29:40.480 --> 01:29:46.480]   He works with Richard Burton, Tim Burton, and a number of other people.
[01:29:46.480 --> 01:29:49.480]   He's the guy who did this great doing the Twitt theme.
[01:29:49.480 --> 01:29:51.480]   I just want to thank you for that, Ashley.
[01:29:51.480 --> 01:29:54.480]   It's just really a great contribution.
[01:29:54.480 --> 01:29:58.480]   How did you come up with that?
[01:29:58.480 --> 01:30:03.480]   >> Well, before you started Twitt, I don't even think you remember it, but you were in the
[01:30:03.480 --> 01:30:09.480]   KFI chat room and you actually mentioned some of the stuff that you'd like to hear in a
[01:30:09.480 --> 01:30:10.480]   video.
[01:30:10.480 --> 01:30:11.480]   >> Oh, I did.
[01:30:11.480 --> 01:30:12.480]   I don't remember that.
[01:30:12.480 --> 01:30:15.480]   >> And you wanted a little guitar, you wanted to be upbeat, a little hip-hop-ish.
[01:30:15.480 --> 01:30:19.480]   You put a few songs up for people to listen to.
[01:30:19.480 --> 01:30:25.480]   And pretty much within a few days, I had just like, what was it, like 30 seconds or something
[01:30:25.480 --> 01:30:26.480]   like that, I think.
[01:30:26.480 --> 01:30:30.480]   And I sent you an email, but I didn't hear anything, so I thought, whatever.
[01:30:30.480 --> 01:30:32.480]   I'll just let it go.
[01:30:32.480 --> 01:30:33.480]   Somebody will put some music.
[01:30:33.480 --> 01:30:37.480]   And then one of the guys in the chat room, and I think you were one of them that pushed
[01:30:37.480 --> 01:30:39.480]   me along there, William.
[01:30:39.480 --> 01:30:42.480]   But there were actually a couple that just said, you need more, you need more.
[01:30:42.480 --> 01:30:43.480]   You got to put more.
[01:30:43.480 --> 01:30:44.480]   You got to have Leo listen to this.
[01:30:44.480 --> 01:30:46.480]   And then they kept bugging in the chat room.
[01:30:46.480 --> 01:30:49.480]   >> Once I heard it, I just said, my lid, I must have missed your email.
[01:30:49.480 --> 01:30:50.480]   >> Yeah, oh, well, I'm sure that's easy.
[01:30:50.480 --> 01:30:51.480]   I wasn't too worried about it.
[01:30:51.480 --> 01:30:53.480]   I wasn't going to send you 50.
[01:30:53.480 --> 01:30:54.480]   >> Well, please do.
[01:30:54.480 --> 01:30:55.480]   >> Everybody else was saying that.
[01:30:55.480 --> 01:31:02.480]   But yeah, it was really the chat room, the guys in the KFI that Mike B and Dan, there's
[01:31:02.480 --> 01:31:04.480]   a big game and they finally got you to hear it.
[01:31:04.480 --> 01:31:05.480]   >> Yeah, I'm so glad they did.
[01:31:05.480 --> 01:31:06.480]   >> Yeah.
[01:31:06.480 --> 01:31:07.480]   >> Those are the way they did.
[01:31:07.480 --> 01:31:12.480]   Well, those of you who are here live earlier, you heard Ash perform a little bit of that.
[01:31:12.480 --> 01:31:13.480]   We're going to close the show with that.
[01:31:13.480 --> 01:31:14.480]   I want to thank you, Ash.
[01:31:14.480 --> 01:31:17.480]   I want to thank our panel today.
[01:31:17.480 --> 01:31:21.480]   And I really want to thank the live audience for being here.
[01:31:21.480 --> 01:31:22.480]   Thanks.
[01:31:22.480 --> 01:31:24.480]   Because we couldn't do this without you.
[01:31:24.480 --> 01:31:26.480]   Thanks to Apple and the Apple Store San Francisco.
[01:31:26.480 --> 01:31:32.480]   Remember we're live from now on in Newtons, locks for landing in beautiful Marin County.
[01:31:32.480 --> 01:31:35.480]   Please come by and say hi anytime the pocket protectors will come in the next couple of
[01:31:35.480 --> 01:31:38.480]   weeks and I'll have them for everybody who wants to.
[01:31:38.480 --> 01:31:42.480]   Say it with me, ladies and gentlemen, another twit is in the can.
[01:31:42.480 --> 01:31:43.480]   Have a great one.
[01:31:43.480 --> 01:31:44.480]   Bye bye.
[01:31:44.480 --> 01:31:45.480]   [Applause]
[01:31:45.480 --> 01:32:11.480]   [Applause]
[01:32:11.480 --> 01:32:21.480]   [Applause]
[01:32:21.480 --> 01:32:31.480]   [Applause]
[01:32:31.480 --> 01:32:57.480]   [Applause]
