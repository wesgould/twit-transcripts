[00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.400]   It's time for Twit this week in tech
[00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.000]   to show that covers the tech news of the week gone by

[00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.680]   And I am just thrilled.
[00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.320]   We've been able to get people in studio for almost every show
[00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.240]   since we moved to the Brickhouse Studio.
[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.400]   But there's one guy that I always wanted, that one guy
[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.520]   I could not get for the longest time.
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.640]   Mr. Merlin Mann is in here in studio with us.
[00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:44.200]   Hi, Leah.
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.160]   Mr43folders.com/merlinman.com.
[00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.320]   And his great show on the 5x5 network with Dan Benjamin
[00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.320]   back to work, productivity, communication work barriers,
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:55.840]   constraints, tools, and more.
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.240]   Is there anything you left out?
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.880]   On a May.
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:59.920]   There's no on a May in that show.
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:00.520]   Oh, yeah.
[00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:01.360]   We have a whole manga.
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.280]   Is that how you pronounce it?
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.840]   Yeah.
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.000]   Been manga corner.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.840]   Manga corner.
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:06.340]   Yeah.
[00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:07.160]   5x5.
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.640]   Thank you for having me.
[00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:08.080]   It's going to be.
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.320]   For those of you who haven't been here,
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:10.520]   it's extraordinary in here.
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.000]   It's a lot like the Captain Nemo ride.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.720]   It is.
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.120]   Yeah.
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.560]   It's a thrill ride.
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.480]   Well, we're really glad to have you back, my old man.
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:17.680]   Very nice to see you.
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:18.680]   Haven't seen you in ages.
[00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.680]   He brought his wife and that kid, and they ran off.
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:21.240]   But--
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.800]   So I know.
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.280]   It was nice to meet Ellen.
[00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.480]   She's four years old.
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.640]   She's like six feet tall.
[00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:26.480]   Yeah, it's amazing.
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.800]   Giant kid.
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.960]   You think in Beach volleyball or basketball?
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:30.480]   Catch the side.
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.280]   That's her decision.
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.280]   I don't want to push really bad.
[00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.200]   That's-- I don't blame her.
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.520]   You know, she would--
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:34.280]   Floris, whatever.
[00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.240]   Whatever direction she wants to go, basketball, I'm good.
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.160]   Giant, big head.
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.680]   Also, here.
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.040]   Really glad to have him up here for the first time, Mr. Harry
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.240]   McCracken from the technology--
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.000]   technologyizer blog.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.200]   Great to see you, Harry.
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.360]   It's nice to be here in person.
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.520]   We've ever had you in person.
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:49.040]   Never.
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.240]   I mean, if I knew you were so close to Copperfield,
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.880]   I would have come down--
[00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:52.680]   You like the bookstore?
[00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:53.280]   Love that place.
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.560]   We have a great independent bookstore.
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.360]   Still, one of the last places in the world,
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.680]   I think, with an independent bookstore.
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.760]   And also, unfortunately, we haven't
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.880]   got Dwight to come up from Houston.
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:03.760]   Maybe someday soon.
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:09.000]   Dwight Silverman of the Houston Chronicle, blog.cron.com/techblog.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.200]   Hey, Dwight.
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.480]   Hey, Leo, how are you doing?
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:12.760]   Very hot here.
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.080]   It's really hot here.
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.040]   It's muggy.
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.440]   I bet you don't--
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.800]   No, it's not too muggy, but I'll tell you something.
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.560]   I'm going to show you something that's kind of amazing.
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:22.640]   Whoa, no, no.
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:23.480]   That's not real.
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:24.680]   Yep, that is real.
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:25.840]   That's now.
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:26.480]   Those look--
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.480]   That number looks as fake as the TMZ picture of Steve Jobs.
[00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.040]   I don't buy it.
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.040]   I don't buy it.
[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.600]   I think you'll be Photoshopping it.
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:34.920]   It's the second day in a row.
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:35.840]   It's been 100--
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:36.680]   I'm here.
[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:37.720]   Horrible.
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.240]   It is horrible.
[00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.920]   Well, I bet you're glad, though, that you're not
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:41.680]   getting the hurricane.
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.080]   Usually, Houston is the hurricane central.
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.280]   We've been having a drought on top of this.
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.880]   It hasn't rained in forever.
[00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.440]   And so I would take a little minor hurricane
[00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.440]   like Irene turned out to be.
[00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.360]   Yeah, thank goodness, by the way.
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.680]   It was a little scary.
[00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:56.240]   It really was.
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.880]   So we're glad all of our friends and listeners
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.200]   on the east coast of--
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:01.760]   I presume survived.
[00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.240]   Dickie D, actually, Dick D Bartol did a funny thing.
[00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:07.760]   He put a drop cam on his boat so that he could watch to see
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.200]   whether it was-- I don't know, what was he going to do
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.120]   if it started sinking?
[00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.400]   He said he would run down the three blocks
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.200]   and tie it up better or something.
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.600]   It started sinking.
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.000]   But then he decided he wanted to do a show.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.680]   This is how far people would go to do a show.
[00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.600]   The camera was inside the cabin of the boat looking out
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.080]   the window so you'd hear the rain in the roof
[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.640]   and see the water coming down.
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:27.880]   It's actually really cool.
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.880]   So he started calling his answering machine on the boat.
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.160]   And he knew that it would play back.
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.840]   So he would do two-minute monologues into the drop cam
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.720]   by calling his answering machine on the boat.
[00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.080]   I'd like to say that sounds to me
[00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.840]   like an excuse to buy new equipment.
[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:43.920]   No, I think it's--
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.080]   I think a boat cam is a call for help.
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.240]   That means you just want to get in the Prius
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.920]   and go to the radio show.
[00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:50.640]   It's pretty funny, I have to say.
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.360]   Where was the boat?
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.600]   It was in the--
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.520]   I want to say, I can't remember which marine--
[00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:58.320]   it's in New York City.
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.240]   It was on the Hudson, I think.
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.760]   Wow.
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:02.920]   I think it's on the Hudson, yeah.
[00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:04.840]   79th Street, that's right.
[00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.640]   Thank you very much on the Hudson.
[00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.200]   The 79th Street boat basin.
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.080]   So Hudson overflowed its banks.
[00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.640]   It did.
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.960]   It came up on Riverside Drive.
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.120]   So what happened to his boat?
[00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.880]   Did his boat--
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.480]   I think it was fun.
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:19.640]   I think it was fun.
[00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:20.140]   Right?
[00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.880]   Everybody in the chat room?
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:21.400]   Yeah.
[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.920]   I think the only risk is that it would--
[00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:25.640]   this has happened.
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:26.600]   He said this happened before, was
[00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.120]   that the river rises high enough
[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.360]   that it's above the pylons of the pier.
[00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:30.720]   Right.
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.680]   And then the boat come back down on the pylons.
[00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.560]   It poke a hole in it.
[00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:35.360]   What's the chat room?
[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.440]   What's the link to Dick's drop cam?
[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.000]   We'll see if we can see his boat.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.160]   And then we'll get to actually the news.
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:44.160]   Dropcam.com.
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.840]   Thank you, Myra.
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:46.480]   Myra Joyce.
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.400]   So let's see if we can see Dick DiBartolo's
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.600]   boat on the drop cam.
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:50.920]   I know.
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:52.360]   This is excitement, isn't it?
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.000]   You know, the main reason I came here
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.360]   is because my family had to go to the outlet mall.
[00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.240]   I don't know if your viewers are familiar with the true fame
[00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.760]   of Petaloma, the outlet mall.
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.800]   It's actually why people come to Petaloma.
[00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:02.240]   It's true.
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.160]   They've got a big placard out there.
[00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.640]   It's literally-- anyway, we went to the outlet mall.
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:07.840]   There's a hurricane simulator.
[00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.560]   You can stand for two bucks.
[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:11.600]   You can stand in a big tube and it blows you.
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:11.920]   Are you kidding?
[00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:12.320]   Really hard.
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:12.760]   Yep.
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:13.760]   75 miles an hour.
[00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:14.440]   Boom.
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:15.080]   Here?
[00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:16.080]   Two dollars out the door.
[00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:16.720]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.760]   It's a nice one, the more with the gout.
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:19.760]   They used to--
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:20.760]   About pants.
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:23.840]   They used to do that radio station promotions.
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.680]   They put you in a booth and they'd put money in there.
[00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:27.280]   Oh, sure.
[00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:28.200]   And then they'd blow it.
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.960]   And whatever you could grab, that's what you get.
[00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.160]   I always wish it would be silver dollars.
[00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:32.360]   That'd be more fun.
[00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:33.320]   You're gonna make a Mernet.
[00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:33.960]   Really Mernet.
[00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:34.720]   I'm serious.
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.920]   It's like one of those Neil Young type level of fans.
[00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:37.600]   Like really coming out.
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:38.640]   Ladies and gentlemen, there it is.
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:40.440]   There's Dick's-- why was I not getting it?
[00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:41.880]   But yeah.
[00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:43.040]   So there's Dick's boat and looks fine.
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:43.640]   Looks peaceful.
[00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:44.960]   Yeah.
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.160]   So--
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:47.760]   It's better than a lot of what I've seen on PBS.
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:52.800]   For those of you making book, 32 seconds into the show
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:53.840]   and already we've got a--
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.000]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   [SINGING]
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.360]   Thank you very much, Mearland Man.
[00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:59.880]   It wouldn't be Mearland Man without a rattle.
[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:01.080]   I've gotten so much better.
[00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:02.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:03.240]   You're high.
[00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:04.600]   I have to.
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.880]   Steve Jobs retires this week.
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:08.200]   That's really the big story.
[00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:10.040]   This was a month of amazing stories.
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:13.200]   Motorola, Google, HP getting out of the PC business.
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:18.680]   And now, one of the true pioneers, the legend, probably,
[00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:21.360]   maybe arguably the single most important person
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.400]   in the personal computer business
[00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:27.040]   and the technology business, the Henry Ford of PCs
[00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:28.760]   announces his retirement.
[00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:30.440]   And it does it in a kind of a sad way.
[00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:33.200]   With a letter to the board of directors saying,
[00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:37.520]   I always said that if I couldn't do my job on paraphrasing
[00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:41.240]   here, I would be the first to say so and step down
[00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:43.360]   and that time has come.
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:46.280]   Which I have to say, knowing how 60
[00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:51.520]   if has been really implies that the end is nigh, I guess.
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:54.880]   I hate to be a morbid person.
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:57.080]   What was your take on all of this?
[00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:02.120]   When I first heard it, my initial thought
[00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:08.280]   was what you thought that, well, we're writing this now
[00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:11.280]   and we may end up doing an obit soon.
[00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:13.440]   But to a certain extent, I don't think so.
[00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:17.160]   And I liked what John de Vorek said about the timing of it
[00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:21.160]   that it may have had as much to do with Tim Cook,
[00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:22.800]   as it did with Steve Jobs.
[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:25.520]   Tim Cook is the COO of Apple, who's Steve--
[00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:26.400]   He's now the CEO.
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:27.960]   Nominated to take his place, yeah.
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:28.600]   Right.
[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:34.920]   And de Vorek said that you can't pen
[00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:40.520]   a temporary and interim CEO title on somebody forever.
[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:43.360]   Except it didn't Steve Jobs have interim CEO forever.
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:44.800]   He was the I-CEO.
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:45.120]   Yeah.
[00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:45.960]   Right.
[00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:47.640]   Right.
[00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:50.200]   And so they didn't want to lose Tim Cook.
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:54.800]   And so they wound up essentially pushing this forward.
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:58.280]   Steve does remain as chairman, and he does remain
[00:08:58.280 --> 00:08:59.520]   as an Apple employee.
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:03.240]   And both the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal
[00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:05.400]   said that he will have-- continue
[00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:07.480]   to have a hand in product development.
[00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:11.760]   So that certainly makes a lot of sense.
[00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:13.560]   And Steve probably isn't still--
[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:14.080]   isn't well.
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:17.520]   That's probably still taking a lot of his time.
[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:20.440]   So to put all those together-- and I think it kind of makes
[00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:25.960]   sense-- it may not be as morbid as we all initially thought.
[00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:27.680]   Harry, does that scenario make sense?
[00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:31.360]   Well, I mean, if he wanted to do it at the best possible time,
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:32.240]   it made a lot of sense.
[00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:34.560]   Because Apple is at its absolute high point now.
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:35.920]   It couldn't be at a higher peak.
[00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:38.440]   And over the last two and a half years--
[00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:40.720]   Watch your guess, I mean, Jobs has been on medical leave
[00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:44.240]   for about half of the last two and a half years.
[00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:45.240]   He's certainly contributed.
[00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:47.520]   But on the other hand, with him less deeply involved,
[00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:50.560]   they not only have done OK, they've flourished.
[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:52.880]   And so my hope would be that he did it because of the timing
[00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:55.520]   felt right rather than because he had no other option.
[00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:56.040]   Yeah.
[00:09:56.040 --> 00:10:01.040]   Merlin, your thoughts on all this?
[00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:03.800]   I wouldn't want to speak to anything about the health
[00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:04.760]   part because I don't really know.
[00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:05.600]   We don't know.
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:09.040]   But we know as he resigned from a position.
[00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:10.960]   So it's hard to know how much he'll be involved.
[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:13.720]   But I would have to guess that rather than assuming
[00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:16.160]   that it's telegraphing something either about his health
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:18.720]   or the company, I would just say he doesn't want
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:22.160]   to be a distraction or he doesn't want speculation about his
[00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:24.080]   health to be a distraction or any of that stuff.
[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:26.720]   And it's clear enough that even during a slow news month,
[00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:27.720]   that is the story.
[00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:28.720]   Distraction.
[00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:30.960]   Yeah, well, it's not surprising necessarily.
[00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:34.720]   But it just strikes me that he's a man who's very careful
[00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:39.040]   with words inside of a company that is very aware
[00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:41.000]   of how important--
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.080]   I don't want to say the look of things.
[00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:46.440]   But I think it's nice to do it in the way that he wants.
[00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:48.480]   And I think he should be allowed to pick his shot.
[00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:51.400]   And if it's the time, it's the time.
[00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:53.840]   The culture of that company, though, is so--
[00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:56.240]   gosh, is there anybody more associated with a brand?
[00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:58.200]   Tim Cook says Apple's not going to change, I think,
[00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:02.120]   to reassure the rank and file the company itself.
[00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:04.000]   But I have to say Apple.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.760]   There's no way Apple doesn't change this.
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:07.280]   That's the point-- that makes Apple Apples.
[00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:08.560]   They're always changing.
[00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:11.160]   What doesn't change, though, is, in my opinion,
[00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:14.040]   is that they have such a--
[00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:15.080]   what's the word?
[00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:17.200]   They seem to-- some of them group are set
[00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:21.120]   a while back on during fireball, is that where most companies
[00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:23.080]   seem scared of not replicating their success,
[00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:25.920]   their company that is much more concerned with not doing
[00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:27.800]   something new and trying something different.
[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:31.440]   I think that culture is a part of such a part of the company.
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:34.960]   I don't know.
[00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:36.320]   I think it will change a lot.
[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:38.080]   It's just-- think about how the company's changed
[00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:40.160]   in the last five years.
[00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:43.440]   I bought a Norwegian black metal album.
[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:45.760]   On my phone at night-- well, my point being,
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:48.320]   if you wanted to buy a Norwegian black metal album--
[00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:50.480]   I believe it was either-- might have been mayhem, I think--
[00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:52.440]   if you wanted to buy that, like a few years ago,
[00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:54.680]   you would have had to go to some really squirrely record
[00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:56.160]   store outside of town.
[00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:56.640]   It's not--
[00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:57.880]   which might have been part of the fun.
[00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:58.400]   Let's face it.
[00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:00.040]   Sure, like when I was back in Florida,
[00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:01.960]   we would always have to go to Tampa, go to Vinal Fever
[00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:02.640]   to get these records.
[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:04.480]   But my point being, like, it's changed.
[00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:06.520]   We're still kind of treating these computer stories.
[00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:08.520]   And the whole market has changed so much.
[00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:09.960]   The whole landscape has changed.
[00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:10.160]   And--
[00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:11.760]   Doing good part to Steve Jobs and--
[00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:14.440]   A lot of people say do the Tim Cook, too, in some ways,
[00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:16.200]   that just that ability to run operations.
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:18.160]   Anyway, I don't know what it means.
[00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:19.760]   I try not to read too much into it,
[00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:23.240]   because I'm bummed, because I like what the guy's done,
[00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:24.840]   and he's been really inspirational to me
[00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:26.560]   in terms of the way he approaches business.
[00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:27.720]   So I feel bad for the guy.
[00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:30.960]   It's hard to know that somebody powerful is in a position--
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:33.080]   is moving closer toward a position where they have less power.
[00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:34.600]   I think that's all it feels a little tragic.
[00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:34.960]   Yeah.
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:36.840]   Well, I totally feel bad for the guy.
[00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:39.760]   But I do think that there--
[00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:41.640]   I just don't see Steve relinquishing the reins,
[00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:43.960]   unless he absolutely had to.
[00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:46.440]   I don't see him doing it because Tim Cook is going to leave,
[00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:49.840]   or because Tim Cook is tired of being the CEO.
[00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:51.560]   I don't see him doing it because it's
[00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:54.680]   the right time for the product cycle of the stock market.
[00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:58.880]   This is Steve Jobs' life is Apple Computer.
[00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:01.040]   When he was wandering in the wilderness,
[00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:04.280]   when he was at Next and Pixar, he still--
[00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:06.080]   I know, because I spent a little time with him--
[00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:08.120]   never stopped thinking about Apple Computer.
[00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:11.880]   It was first, last, and always on his mind.
[00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:16.200]   For him, I can only imagine how difficult this must be.
[00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:18.080]   And I think that if you read between the lines
[00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:20.360]   and the letters, the letter that he wrote,
[00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:23.920]   it really feels a Lee Jek.
[00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:25.720]   L-A-G-E-E. How would you pronounce that?
[00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:26.400]   L-A-Jek.
[00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:28.400]   L-A-J-E-E.
[00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:30.400]   It should not be that soft, but that's how I roll.
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:34.720]   It feels like a very poignant farewell.
[00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:38.600]   And Steve Jobs has never been the kind of guy that
[00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:42.880]   would soft pedal anything or do anything to be nice.
[00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:45.160]   He's the kind of guy who would say, no, I'm standing here
[00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:46.640]   until I absolutely can't on.
[00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:48.720]   I think the fact that he took two medical leads of absence
[00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:51.800]   and came back again and again, despite obviously
[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:54.520]   grave illnesses, shows that.
[00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:58.560]   Nevertheless, I think what really you got to do
[00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:02.080]   is just say, this guy-- Doc Serrel's called him
[00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:03.680]   the Beethoven of technology.
[00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:04.960]   This guy was Da Vinci.
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:06.560]   This guy was Henry Ford.
[00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:09.400]   This guy was so important to the thing
[00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:13.280]   that we care a lot about, which is technology,
[00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:16.520]   that you've got to mark the transition.
[00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:17.240]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:19.960]   And I don't question that it would change-- I'm sorry.
[00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:21.720]   I don't question that things are going to change.
[00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:23.680]   I think the interesting question would be,
[00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:25.280]   how will it change and when?
[00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:27.640]   Because they seem like they've been pretty good at reacting.
[00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:30.040]   Not reacting to the market, but really, one of the things
[00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:31.880]   I think drives people crazy about Apple
[00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:34.320]   is how adamant they are about defining their own market.
[00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:36.000]   And somebody starts chasing their tail
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:36.960]   and they change tails.
[00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:39.600]   And some say, I think what's interesting about it, though,
[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:41.560]   is that I think the guy-- I agree with you.
[00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:43.640]   I think he cares so much about his company, though,
[00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:46.080]   that he would never want the story to become more about him
[00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:46.720]   than benefits companies.
[00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:48.320]   Oh, no, no, I agree.
[00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:51.960]   I think what really happened is he finally--
[00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:54.960]   he was diagnosed with a fatal illness five years ago,
[00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:56.360]   so almost six years ago.
[00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:58.360]   They said, you have six months to live.
[00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:01.440]   I think he held on and through what
[00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:05.560]   must have been uncalculable, pain and suffering,
[00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:09.840]   got the iPad out the door, got the retail on track--
[00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:10.720]   iPhone.
[00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:11.680]   iPhone.
[00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:15.920]   And I think that his last public appearance
[00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:18.960]   was two months ago in front of the Cupertino City Council,
[00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:23.200]   asking them permission to build this amazing space,
[00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:25.080]   slang-fying saucer in Cupertino.
[00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:26.800]   I think those pieces were the pieces
[00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:28.920]   he wanted to put in place as his legacy.
[00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:31.040]   I think he says with the iPad, I think he says, I did it.
[00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:34.320]   I finally got the computer that Apple was created to build.
[00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:36.680]   The computer for the rest of us, I got it out into people's
[00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:37.240]   hands.
[00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:39.800]   And I think that in a way, that's what really happened,
[00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:44.560]   was that Steve got to the point that he could say, I've done it.
[00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:48.520]   But Leo, I wouldn't discount the fact that he is--
[00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:51.160]   he's still the chairman, and he still is an Apple employee.
[00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:54.040]   When you're a CEO, you have all kinds of things
[00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:57.640]   that you need to do and that you need to pay attention to in terms
[00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:00.200]   of fiduciary duties and corporate duties.
[00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:04.080]   And he could toss those aside and focus on the thing he does
[00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:06.120]   best, which is product--
[00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:07.200]   I hope that's the case.
[00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:09.720]   You're going to be saying, God, we pray that's the case, right?
[00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:12.320]   He said, I can't be CEO anymore, which is not the same thing
[00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:13.680]   as saying I can't--
[00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:15.160]   We're a traffle anymore.
[00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:16.280]   Right.
[00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:21.080]   And so if this frees him up to be more Steve Jobs,
[00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:22.800]   the caveat to that is--
[00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:25.080]   I hope that's true, boy.
[00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:27.360]   Merlin mentioned the Gruber piece.
[00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:30.800]   Gruber talked about that Steve Jobs' best product was Apple
[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:32.000]   itself.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.360]   And hopefully, that will continue in its current--
[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:40.520]   with its current vision for a long time.
[00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:45.280]   But I think he's still free to kind of play in the space.
[00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:47.760]   Maybe even be more free to play in the product development
[00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:48.280]   space.
[00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:51.200]   And we may see even more things that have his hand on him.
[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:53.280]   I pray that that's true.
[00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:54.640]   I just can't see--
[00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:59.720]   I'm looking at the executive chart now, the people in charge,
[00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:02.040]   post Steve Jobs, Tim Cook.
[00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:04.440]   I just don't see here the creativity, the talent.
[00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:05.560]   Maybe we just don't know them yet.
[00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:07.480]   Scott Forstall, Johnny on.
[00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:07.960]   The Jobs.
[00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:08.760]   There's a guy.
[00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:11.200]   But again, this was very much under--
[00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:13.120]   No, I don't know why Ron Johnson's still on that org chart,
[00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:14.680]   because he works for J.C. Penney's now.
[00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:15.000]   Not yet.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.040]   He's leaving in November.
[00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:17.640]   OK, so he's technically still there.
[00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:18.280]   He's still hanging on.
[00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:20.400]   He's running the retail operation.
[00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:21.200]   Bob Mansfield.
[00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:24.360]   We saw a lot of Bob Mansfield with the iPhone,
[00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:25.640]   most recent iPhone.
[00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:28.720]   We don't know most of these people all that well.
[00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:30.080]   Phil Schiller is the one we know best.
[00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:31.680]   You know, Phil, I'm Tim Cook.
[00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:33.760]   We don't know that he doesn't have what it takes
[00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:35.160]   to provide some of the vision.
[00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:37.200]   We just know that he's a really good operations guy.
[00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:38.840]   We saw him speak a couple of times.
[00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:39.920]   Well, he's not inspiring.
[00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:42.880]   He's not electrifying, but nobody else
[00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:45.000]   has electrifying Steve Jobs, so.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.920]   But that's really my point.
[00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:48.280]   You don't replace Steve Jobs.
[00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:49.720]   You cannot replace Steve Jobs.
[00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:51.360]   And any more you could replace him Michelangelo.
[00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:57.960]   I mean, this guy is a once-in-a-century type of person.
[00:17:57.960 --> 00:17:59.560]   Absolutely.
[00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:00.760]   More so than Bill Gates.
[00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:01.920]   There's an interesting thing in that--
[00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:03.320]   I think this came up--
[00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:05.120]   I don't think I have access to the full article--
[00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:08.040]   in that fortune story about the hiring of--
[00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:10.160]   I'm sure I'm mispronounced his name--
[00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:14.420]   Joel Padoni, who was at the Yale Business School,
[00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:15.480]   your alma mater.
[00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:17.120]   They hired this guy from this big business school
[00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:17.720]   to come in.
[00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:18.920]   At the time, everybody thought it was
[00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:22.000]   going to be to come into Apple and work on, theoretically,
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.400]   something like iTunes University.
[00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:25.480]   But it turned out that the reason he was there
[00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:27.040]   was to work on a problem that a lot of companies
[00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:29.320]   struggle with, which has taken all the institutional wisdom.
[00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:32.120]   And all the information that's floating around
[00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:33.600]   that hasn't been put anywhere and figure out
[00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:35.880]   how to institutionalize that and put it somewhere where it
[00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:37.920]   can be shared that's more than a wiki.
[00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:38.920]   And I think--
[00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:39.960]   There's kind of wiki.
[00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:42.080]   I think it's one of the interesting things--
[00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:43.080]   One of the wiki's for--
[00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:43.880]   I was on your wiki.
[00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:44.880]   I learned a lot about this one.
[00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:46.640]   That's what our wiki's for, yeah.
[00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:48.440]   I think one of the interesting things to watch
[00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:49.920]   is going to be-- well, first of all,
[00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:51.200]   you've met people from Apple.
[00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:54.640]   I mean, they don't have to have Steve standing over their shoulder
[00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:55.760]   to understand the man's stance.
[00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:58.240]   And certainly, his DNA has been communicated thoroughly.
[00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:00.600]   I think it's super interesting to see just--
[00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:02.960]   this isn't just about Apple, but companies in general--
[00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:05.920]   I mean, gosh, everybody could go to one of the pages
[00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:07.720]   with all those faces on and all those bios
[00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:09.960]   and wonder, gosh, will it be OK with or without these people?
[00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:11.640]   Well, the strength of a lot of these companies
[00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:12.320]   is in the rank and file.
[00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:13.840]   And then the director level people.
[00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:15.880]   And those people at the top are certainly important.
[00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:18.920]   But I think what makes some of these companies so great
[00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:20.840]   is that down to the person--
[00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:23.360]   I was at Pixar a few weeks ago, and every single person
[00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:27.080]   in that building feels imbued with the spirit of trying
[00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:28.240]   to make something truly great.
[00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:30.360]   And Steve really hasn't been there in a long time.
[00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:30.860]   Right.
[00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:32.120]   Yeah, I mean, obviously, Steve company too
[00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:33.120]   wasn't thinking of that way.
[00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:33.640]   But yeah, exactly.
[00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:37.040]   I mean, there's not that many places you can go where you
[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:39.800]   will see that level of engagement with making
[00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:41.240]   something unforgettable.
[00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:43.440]   So I just think that's a super interesting idea
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:44.320]   for companies in general.
[00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:46.440]   Though, I wonder how many companies have taken that much
[00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:49.280]   time to try and turn what is currently a good idea with lots
[00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:52.600]   of wizards into something that they can share for 10 years
[00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:52.920]   down the road.
[00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:53.760]   Package.
[00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:54.800]   Yeah.
[00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:57.600]   You did a great job, Harry, of looking at the first time
[00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:59.600]   Steve Jobs stepped down.
[00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:00.200]   And it's funny.
[00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:02.480]   It just shows you that even in 1985--
[00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:04.240]   this is on the "Technologizer" blog--
[00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:09.080]   "Infill World" says, can Apple hold together 26 years ago,
[00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:10.120]   or 16 years ago?
[00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:12.520]   Yeah, and a lot of the experts thought
[00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:13.920]   that Apple would be just fine then.
[00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:15.840]   I mean, some said it was a good move
[00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:19.080]   to get rid of Steve Jobs, because he was trouble.
[00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:20.840]   Employees in the field away from--
[00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:24.160]   this is a great quote from the "Infill World" article.
[00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:26.140]   "Employees in the field away from the Daily News reports
[00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:28.400]   that dwell on the dark specter of layoffs seem
[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:29.760]   bullion."
[00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:32.600]   Quote, "At last, we have someone who's watching the bottom line
[00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:35.760]   says a nearly five-year Apple veteran about the rise of John
[00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:36.440]   Scully.
[00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:39.400]   He's brought accountability to an organization which
[00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:40.600]   has been lacking for five years.
[00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:42.640]   I think Apple's making the transition from one phase of his
[00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:43.440]   life to the next.
[00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:46.800]   I don't know that the image of a leader clad in a bow tie,
[00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:49.760]   jeans, and suspenders could help us survive in the coming
[00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:50.080]   years.
[00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:50.720]   Well, they were wrong.
[00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:53.200]   It turned out he was the only guy who could have a help
[00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:54.680]   Apple survive.
[00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:57.200]   10 years later, of course, Jobs returned to save that
[00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:57.700]   company.
[00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:01.320]   Something else we can't forget is that Apple without Steve Jobs
[00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:04.120]   really almost went under.
[00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:08.960]   But Apple also at the time was not with Steve Jobs then was
[00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:11.680]   not at its healthiest.
[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:13.840]   We have a special guest online.
[00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:16.800]   I believe Steve Wozniak is on the line right now.
[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:18.000]   Woz.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.640]   Woz.
[00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:21.280]   Hi, I think I'm talking to you.
[00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:22.360]   I don't think it's video.
[00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:24.440]   Yeah, I have to listen to video.
[00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:24.920]   That's fine.
[00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:27.520]   It's just great to talk to you, Steve.
[00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:28.660]   Yeah, I know you've been--
[00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:30.460]   I've talked to you, Lee, of course, ever since those
[00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:33.540]   early days at TV and--
[00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:35.340]   Woz is a long time friend.
[00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:37.500]   And someday, I hope you'll come up and see our new digs up
[00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:39.260]   here, Steve.
[00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:41.260]   And I know you've had a crazy week.
[00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:42.460]   I saw you on CNN.
[00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:43.860]   I know you drove down for that.
[00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:45.260]   You've been running all over the place.
[00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:48.180]   So I'm very glad you could come on.
[00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:54.700]   And I imagine-- you were very upbeat on Pierce Morgan.
[00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:57.020]   But I imagine that this is--
[00:21:57.020 --> 00:22:00.520]   you must feel a little bit like it's the end of the an era.
[00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:02.040]   Well, it is like the end of an era.
[00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:04.520]   And that's partly why I'm upbeat.
[00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:06.120]   I mean, it's like a lot of things.
[00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:07.520]   I'm a pretty quiet guy.
[00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:09.960]   And I don't let out a lot of personal feelings.
[00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:12.440]   And even directly to people when they matter,
[00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:14.120]   I just am that way.
[00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:16.400]   And it's like this was an important time
[00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:18.640]   to make sure that I haven't felt like I
[00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:21.240]   want my own feelings to get hurt.
[00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:24.680]   And the world recognized Steve and the right
[00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:25.340]   ways.
[00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:32.300]   And I've always felt that way about him.
[00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:33.260]   It's kind of neat.
[00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:34.740]   We go back and we think about it.
[00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:37.660]   I watched Steve on some of the interviews he does,
[00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:39.540]   and even things like "D7" Bill Gates.
[00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:41.740]   And he really talks fondly, even on the phone with me,
[00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:43.340]   about those early days.
[00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:45.460]   So I know that in the last year or so,
[00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:48.540]   it had really started getting to him those fun memories
[00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:51.460]   when we were kids doing kid things.
[00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:54.380]   And another thing that really strikes me--
[00:22:54.380 --> 00:22:55.760]   he doesn't get brought up a lot-- but it was one
[00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:56.900]   they did that "D7" interview.
[00:22:56.900 --> 00:22:59.880]   And Bill Gates said, he just wished he had that thing
[00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:00.980]   that Steve has.
[00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:02.380]   And it's the visionary thing of being
[00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:05.120]   able to realize what the future is.
[00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:07.020]   Last time I spoke to Steve, he said, well,
[00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:08.180]   you know I'm not very technical.
[00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:10.200]   I halted him on that one right away.
[00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:13.020]   And I said, first of all, what's most important
[00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:15.980]   is knowing what people really want
[00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:17.740]   and what they will appreciate and like.
[00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:20.780]   That's what leads to knowing how to make the good products.
[00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:23.140]   And Steve got silent right away.
[00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:26.020]   I don't know if he was going to put me down or put me up
[00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:26.700]   or something.
[00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:28.580]   I think he'd read somewhere something
[00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:31.460]   saying I might want to return to Apple, which every once
[00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:32.220]   in a while that comes up.
[00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:34.940]   So I did not get it right away to relieve him.
[00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:36.780]   But I don't know what his call was about.
[00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:40.220]   But anyway, it's like, you know he knows how to tell
[00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:43.700]   who's BS and who's really got strong, especially
[00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:45.820]   when it comes from technical people and engineers.
[00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:47.220]   Which one knows what they're doing?
[00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:50.500]   Which one is on a track that could lead to leapfrog,
[00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:52.220]   you know, a jumping technology?
[00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:55.820]   And which ones are just kind of using a bunch of words
[00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:57.900]   that are going around the tech industry,
[00:23:57.900 --> 00:24:00.620]   but they really don't know how to make an advance.
[00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:02.500]   And he was always good at telling that difference.
[00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:04.300]   So I think those were a lot of things
[00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:09.260]   that were important factors in his making great products.
[00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:12.580]   And you know, every time I ever spoke to him over the years,
[00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:15.860]   every time it came out that the products had to be great.
[00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:17.940]   You know, and I would talk about things to him
[00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:20.660]   like how a lot of what Apple has
[00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:22.980]   is this huge following community.
[00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:24.220]   Apple editors is a product.
[00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:25.860]   A million people buy it right away.
[00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:27.740]   All of a sudden the world has a direction
[00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:30.100]   rather than a whole bunch of competing companies.
[00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:31.740]   It's kind of like you have a standard
[00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:33.940]   when Apple comes out with a new product.
[00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:35.660]   And Steve wanted to buy that right away.
[00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:36.900]   You just wanted to put it in the focus
[00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:38.980]   of when you make great products.
[00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:40.860]   - I remember you talking about every time
[00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:42.980]   you'd invent something, whether it's a blue box
[00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:44.660]   or the Apple one or the Apple two.
[00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:47.460]   Steve would say, I think we can make a business out of this.
[00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:49.660]   - Well, he was, yeah, I mean, that's how we started.
[00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:51.140]   That story is pretty well known now.
[00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:53.180]   He was more the businessman and marketing.
[00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:55.020]   He always had a clue to sales
[00:24:55.020 --> 00:24:56.460]   and he wanted to start companies.
[00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:59.620]   And yeah, the Apple two was actually the sixth time
[00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:03.340]   that I designed something for myself except for breakout.
[00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:05.820]   Steve came to me with the idea from Atari
[00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:07.060]   for doing breakout. - Right, right.
[00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:09.460]   - Every other one I just did on my own, for myself,
[00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:12.540]   no thinking about ever having a sale or a product.
[00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:13.940]   And Steve wanted to do that.
[00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:15.660]   So you need that kind of team.
[00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:17.260]   - It was so fun, you know, it was so fun
[00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:20.420]   because I'd be sitting there in my house
[00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:23.140]   building all these great things and he'd come by and see it.
[00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:24.780]   And usually go up to Oregon
[00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:26.260]   and come back after a few months.
[00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:27.660]   And he just loved seeing it.
[00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:29.540]   He always had ideas of where it could go,
[00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:31.820]   but he was always like 10 years ahead of me saying,
[00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:32.980]   could you put a disc on this?
[00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:34.380]   And I would just say, yes, yes, yes,
[00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:36.900]   'cause I know you can always put something on anything
[00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:38.500]   in the comics. (laughing)
[00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:41.620]   And I was so, I was kind of appeasing him
[00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:43.020]   and then he would say, oh, could you also
[00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:44.260]   write an operating system?
[00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:45.700]   Whoa, whoa, whoa, yes.
[00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:47.620]   And I wasn't sure if a microprocessor
[00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:49.700]   could support an operating system.
[00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:51.580]   And then he would say, you could have multiple people
[00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:53.780]   call in 'cause he was thinking of starting a business
[00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:57.140]   that would replace one he knew, which was time sharing
[00:25:57.140 --> 00:25:59.540]   service in Mountain View called Call Computer,
[00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:01.540]   which was actually where we sold my video terminal
[00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:03.060]   that turned into the Apple One.
[00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:06.780]   So Steve was, yeah, he was always looking for ways
[00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:10.700]   to make something in the world out of these designs.
[00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:13.100]   But you see, he was also good at spotting me.
[00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:15.580]   This young engineer doing all these super creative things
[00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:17.140]   that nobody had done before.
[00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:19.220]   You know, I could just sit down and do circuits
[00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:20.420]   with almost no parts.
[00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:23.820]   And so he spots people like that,
[00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:25.620]   always life, I think, and the best.
[00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:28.300]   And even when I get kind of rusty on technology,
[00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:30.860]   Steve's always been very, very nice to me,
[00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:32.820]   very cordial, very respectful.
[00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:35.700]   And, you know, so I think you just have to be,
[00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:38.180]   at a point in time, you have to be that greatness.
[00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:39.820]   But he wants great people around him.
[00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:42.740]   And that's why I see that Apple is stock full of,
[00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:45.140]   gotta be stock full of Steve Wosniak's
[00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:47.620]   in their categories or better.
[00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:48.780]   - Do you know Tim Cook at all?
[00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:50.300]   Have you talked to him at all?
[00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:51.140]   - I don't know Tim.
[00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:53.980]   All I know of him is, aside from hearsay
[00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:55.140]   and reading articles and all that,
[00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:57.660]   is a couple of videos that I watched,
[00:26:57.660 --> 00:26:58.820]   both which impressed me a lot.
[00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:02.420]   One was he talking to analysts about iPhone or something.
[00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:04.060]   He handled it very well.
[00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:05.500]   You know, back in the day of,
[00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:08.060]   well, what about, why doesn't the iPhone have this?
[00:27:08.060 --> 00:27:09.140]   Or what about that?
[00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:10.340]   His answers were very good.
[00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:11.660]   'Cause I was trying to get a clue
[00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:13.780]   how to answer questions without getting myself
[00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:15.860]   in trouble with Steve and the company.
[00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:17.020]   (laughing)
[00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:19.540]   But more than that, I saw his commencement speech
[00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:23.020]   to onboarding his onboarding state.
[00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:25.380]   And was just very impressed.
[00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:27.300]   You know, he just spoke candidly and openly
[00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:28.300]   and it was coming from the heart.
[00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:30.900]   It wasn't, you know, phony executive type talk
[00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:33.340]   about having feelings and emotions
[00:27:33.340 --> 00:27:36.220]   and what he liked about Steve Jobs
[00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:39.300]   and how it just totally influenced him to come to Apple
[00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:42.380]   and how you had to figure in what you really believed
[00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:44.100]   inside emotionally, you know?
[00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:45.500]   And that's a large part of it.
[00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:47.980]   It helps to have a nice, well-known big company
[00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:49.540]   with Apple's reputation too,
[00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:52.060]   but you just sometimes have to say,
[00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:53.980]   I'm not gonna necessarily take the safe path.
[00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:56.460]   So I'm gonna go with what I think is the better way.
[00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:58.020]   - Is there a particular kind of genius
[00:27:58.020 --> 00:28:00.540]   that you think that Steve Jobs had?
[00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:02.220]   There was, is there someone to characterize
[00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:03.060]   what he's gonna do?
[00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:04.580]   - Well, since I knew him when he was very young,
[00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:08.820]   it's very difficult to recognize any type of genius back then.
[00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:10.460]   Mine was rather easy.
[00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:12.100]   It was a specific type.
[00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:12.940]   - Right.
[00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:16.180]   - His was, he was very like rapid fast thinking,
[00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:18.660]   like he was desperate, almost either ADHD
[00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:21.700]   or kind of like a little bit paranoid
[00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:25.380]   or something like that, desperate, high anxiety to find
[00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:27.420]   the next thing to do, the next thing to have some company,
[00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:29.900]   have some way to get little tiny bits of income, you know?
[00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:31.500]   Get a job here, get a job there.
[00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:34.420]   He was really good on his phone in his parents room.
[00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:36.300]   He could take a call and find somebody that's willing
[00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:39.100]   to sell him some types of electronic switches
[00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:41.620]   for sixth-century, knew he could sell for six bucks.
[00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:44.780]   And I would say, "She's, you could, how can, you know?"
[00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:46.380]   I didn't even think that was ethically right,
[00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:47.700]   but I was kind of proud of him.
[00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:50.100]   I was proud of him before the end of the ethical scale
[00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:51.740]   that doesn't match business ethics.
[00:28:51.740 --> 00:28:53.380]   Matter of fact, when we started Apple,
[00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:56.220]   our founding person, our mentor,
[00:28:56.220 --> 00:28:58.060]   the guy that really made Apple told us
[00:28:58.060 --> 00:28:59.660]   what kind of people we have to hire,
[00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:02.660]   how Steve Jobs had to learn to run every division
[00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:04.780]   in a company, like grooming him for a CEO.
[00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:06.220]   That was Mike Markla.
[00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:08.860]   And he said that, you know, he turned to me
[00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:10.580]   'cause I had questions about some of the things
[00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:12.220]   that we'd have to do in business.
[00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:14.620]   Business ethics is not the same as personal ethics.
[00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:15.460]   - Yeah.
[00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:16.300]   - And I just grind it, well,
[00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:18.020]   I'm just gonna be in engineering anyway.
[00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:19.020]   (laughing)
[00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:20.340]   - You can stay ethical.
[00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:22.140]   - Yeah, because you are ethical in engineering.
[00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:23.740]   - You have to be, it's all black and white.
[00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:24.940]   It either works or it doesn't work.
[00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:25.780]   There's no--
[00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:28.900]   - Yeah, the issue came up around things like,
[00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:31.140]   well, A, I had told some people
[00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:34.660]   we could sell this new computer for like $500
[00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:38.020]   and they were down at Hughes in Southern California.
[00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:39.860]   So, Mike Markla was a nice sweetie.
[00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:40.900]   He let me keep my word.
[00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:44.460]   And he kind of made a few boards available for 500 bucks,
[00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:46.100]   but then only for a very short time
[00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:48.380]   and nobody could ever really find out about it.
[00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:50.980]   So that I kept my word, but the company,
[00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:53.580]   you know, wasn't gonna be a low profit company.
[00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:56.300]   And also, we had to get the TV,
[00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:57.700]   the picture onto a TV.
[00:29:57.700 --> 00:29:59.740]   There was no video in those days.
[00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:01.460]   So you had to use some kind of modulator.
[00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:03.140]   And as a ham radio operator,
[00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:06.380]   I was, you know, my life, I just grew up.
[00:30:06.380 --> 00:30:08.460]   So you have such a young ham radio operator
[00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:12.500]   when you are pure and your ethics are, you know, very,
[00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:14.260]   I don't know, it's very, whatever you call that.
[00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:16.860]   - Non-profit, it's not about money, it's about this.
[00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:21.860]   - No, it's not non-profit, it's kind of a range of ethics.
[00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:23.980]   And the word is just skipping me right now.
[00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:25.740]   Well, you're idealistic.
[00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:27.140]   - Idealistic, there you go.
[00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:29.380]   - I was gonna be a protector for the rest of my life
[00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:32.060]   of the airwaves and not have spurious transmissions
[00:30:32.060 --> 00:30:33.860]   if you ignore TV jammers.
[00:30:33.860 --> 00:30:36.060]   (laughing)
[00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:39.060]   - As a company, as a company, can you make a product
[00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:41.700]   that transmits on channel three?
[00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:43.620]   I wouldn't let Apple do that.
[00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:45.820]   I mean, I said, no, we can't do that.
[00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:48.300]   And, you know, people weren't gonna be able to open
[00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:50.660]   up the back of their TVs and use those oscilloscopes
[00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:53.580]   and run wires into their TVs with little adapter circuits
[00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:55.300]   to get the video displayed.
[00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:59.500]   And so, what we did, I think behind my back,
[00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:01.860]   Mike Markla or somebody in our company,
[00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:04.740]   I think Rod Holt, the guy who designed our power supplier
[00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:07.180]   and one engineer designed a little modulator circuit
[00:31:07.180 --> 00:31:09.620]   and then gave it to an outsider,
[00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:11.460]   which was Marty Spergale and he sold it.
[00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:13.940]   I forgot what he called it, but it was the way
[00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:15.340]   to get your Apple II onto it.
[00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:18.060]   Every time we sold an Apple II, we sold one of those.
[00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:18.900]   - Wow.
[00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:22.500]   - What was the last time you talked to Mr. Jobs?
[00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:23.540]   - Oh, it was a few months ago.
[00:31:23.540 --> 00:31:24.380]   - It's been a while.
[00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:26.620]   - And he called me, yeah, he called me and,
[00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:28.700]   I don't know, he heard something about me.
[00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:31.140]   - Are you anxious to talk to him again or?
[00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:33.140]   - Oh, I always love talking to him.
[00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:34.500]   I don't call him enough.
[00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:37.180]   It's really funny, but today's resignation came out,
[00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:39.500]   was the day I was gonna send him an email,
[00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:41.340]   because everybody has ideas,
[00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:43.140]   a product should do this, product should do that.
[00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:45.180]   And I decided long ago, I'm not gonna get
[00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:47.140]   into this marketing game and decide,
[00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:48.220]   what's right for Apple?
[00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:49.700]   Inside, they have top people,
[00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:51.140]   they really know what they're doing,
[00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:53.260]   they're on top of the answers better than me.
[00:31:53.260 --> 00:31:56.020]   And in the old days, I used to always notify Steve
[00:31:56.020 --> 00:31:57.500]   when something was wrong with a program,
[00:31:57.500 --> 00:31:58.980]   like if you were in a hotel,
[00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:00.340]   you know how you have to have to dial nine
[00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:01.180]   for an outside line?
[00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:02.020]   - Right.
[00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:03.340]   - And then one in area code,
[00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:04.860]   it would switch to the nine and the one.
[00:32:04.860 --> 00:32:06.860]   It was just where it was remote access.
[00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:08.980]   So I told him about it, we got it fixed,
[00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:11.140]   but they took out the ability to call into
[00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:12.660]   your own remote access,
[00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:14.180]   which is the way I called from distance
[00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:15.620]   to join my home network,
[00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:18.540]   back in the early pre-internet days, you know.
[00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:21.700]   So I was pissed, I didn't want to send any more to Apple.
[00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:23.380]   No more fixes for you.
[00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:25.100]   They might also take out the things you like,
[00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:27.100]   which is kind of true of all technology nowadays,
[00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:28.380]   it's going so fast.
[00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:31.020]   And I wanted to send a note to him to tell him
[00:32:31.020 --> 00:32:34.180]   that 'cause Steve always thought about,
[00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:35.740]   well let me think what the issue was.
[00:32:35.740 --> 00:32:37.700]   I gotta get it back in my head.
[00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:40.220]   Tell you, it's something current
[00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:44.420]   and something in the way things should work for humans.
[00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:46.140]   It'll come by me, I'm not gonna waste time now.
[00:32:46.140 --> 00:32:49.460]   - I think he was very focused though on,
[00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:50.340]   it wasn't,
[00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:52.900]   - I know what it was, I know what it was.
[00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:57.380]   On my iPhone, I was starting to get blown away
[00:32:57.380 --> 00:33:00.100]   thinking these computers are gonna become more like humans,
[00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:02.260]   more like people, we're gonna be the pet box.
[00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:05.580]   And my favorite examples of all, I had three of them.
[00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:08.940]   My favorite on Siri Assistant, on the iPhone.
[00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:09.780]   - Right.
[00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:11.580]   - I could say, I could ask the question,
[00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:13.500]   what are the five largest lakes in California?
[00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:16.020]   I tried Google searches and all these other methods
[00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:17.300]   and it'd give me lists of lakes,
[00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:18.300]   you have to come try to figure it out,
[00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:19.140]   you don't get the right,
[00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:21.580]   it's hard to find the one that will get you the right answer.
[00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:23.020]   Siri came back with a list,
[00:33:23.020 --> 00:33:26.340]   one, two, three, four, five, credited to Wilfram Alpha.
[00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:28.220]   Then I said into Siri, I said,
[00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:31.820]   I spoke, what are the prime numbers greater than 87?
[00:33:31.820 --> 00:33:35.020]   The answer came back with only the ones greater than 87
[00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:37.900]   from Wilfram Alpha, which understands greater than.
[00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:39.660]   I thought this was so amazing.
[00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:41.660]   This is the most amazing thing I've ever had.
[00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:42.900]   It disappeared.
[00:33:42.900 --> 00:33:44.980]   Apple bought Siri and just recently,
[00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:46.700]   that, those features disappeared.
[00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:49.380]   Maybe Siri doesn't go to Wilfram Alpha anymore,
[00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:51.300]   but I don't wanna ask a question
[00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:53.940]   and get a bunch of links that might get me to the answer
[00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:55.580]   or get me closer to the answer.
[00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:57.700]   I wanna ask a question and get the answer.
[00:33:57.700 --> 00:33:59.340]   Steve always used to talk about that
[00:33:59.340 --> 00:34:00.900]   in the early days of spreadsheets.
[00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:02.140]   You don't wanna spread cheat,
[00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:04.300]   you just wanna ask how much is my card payment.
[00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:07.180]   Get the answer, maybe it's from some other token,
[00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:09.500]   some other device out there on the cloud.
[00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:11.260]   - Right, he was always, I thought he always had that
[00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:12.180]   in his head. - It's philosophy.
[00:34:12.180 --> 00:34:13.980]   I thought that says, it's philosophy.
[00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:15.660]   Yeah, and I was gonna write him about that
[00:34:15.660 --> 00:34:18.220]   'cause my God, when you can start asking the questions
[00:34:18.220 --> 00:34:19.860]   you have all day long,
[00:34:19.860 --> 00:34:22.620]   I wanna actually ask it right into my iPod Nano
[00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:24.140]   on my watch band.
[00:34:24.140 --> 00:34:25.820]   I just wanna ask questions all day long,
[00:34:25.820 --> 00:34:28.580]   have enough and have somehow enough battery
[00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:29.860]   to connect to the internet.
[00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:30.700]   - Watch.
[00:34:30.700 --> 00:34:31.540]   (laughing)
[00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:32.380]   Yeah.
[00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:33.900]   - Hey Steve, it's always a pleasure.
[00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:35.460]   Can we get you to come up here
[00:34:35.460 --> 00:34:38.060]   and we would love to spend a long time with you.
[00:34:38.060 --> 00:34:39.700]   You're just so much fun to talk to
[00:34:39.700 --> 00:34:42.220]   and I miss seeing we were together in February
[00:34:42.220 --> 00:34:43.540]   in the South America,
[00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:45.340]   New in Janet, it was so much fun to see you
[00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:46.860]   and I hope you'll come up and visit us soon.
[00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:48.220]   - Please know anytime.
[00:34:48.220 --> 00:34:49.820]   Yeah, always willing to help you, Leo.
[00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:50.820]   You're a hero forever.
[00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:52.100]   - Oh, well you're the hero.
[00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:53.620]   Thank you Steve Wozniak.
[00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:54.820]   Really appreciate it.
[00:34:54.820 --> 00:34:55.660]   Take care Steve.
[00:34:55.660 --> 00:34:56.500]   - Bye bye.
[00:34:56.500 --> 00:34:59.860]   There's a guy, it's funny because I was watching him
[00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:03.180]   on CNNC, he was very unassuming
[00:35:03.180 --> 00:35:04.300]   and he said, "Hi, new Steve."
[00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:06.860]   Then we were kids but he wasn't really willing
[00:35:06.860 --> 00:35:08.140]   to talk about Steve today
[00:35:08.140 --> 00:35:09.980]   and I think I understand that.
[00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:10.820]   - He's a nerd.
[00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:11.660]   - He's a nerd.
[00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:12.500]   - No, he's one of us.
[00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:13.500]   That guy's the real deal.
[00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:15.300]   - Yeah, he's the real deal is exactly right.
[00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:16.740]   - Yeah, he's not sitting there
[00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:18.180]   worrying about his brand, he's a nerd.
[00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:19.100]   (laughing)
[00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:21.180]   And I just, I have so much a little
[00:35:21.180 --> 00:35:22.020]   off of that guy and every level.
[00:35:22.020 --> 00:35:23.740]   - Me too, nothing but.
[00:35:23.740 --> 00:35:25.820]   - Okay, let's, let's worry about his brand.
[00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:27.940]   (laughing)
[00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:30.340]   Dwight Silverman is here from the Houston Chronicle,
[00:35:30.340 --> 00:35:32.220]   the tech blog and what's the name?
[00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:34.620]   I can't remember the name of the show on,
[00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:36.380]   public, on BAI.
[00:35:36.380 --> 00:35:39.220]   - It's Technology Bites on K-P-F-T.
[00:35:39.220 --> 00:35:40.060]   - PFTs.
[00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:43.820]   - And actually we're also, I think we're on KKR-N now
[00:35:43.820 --> 00:35:45.900]   in California.
[00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:49.220]   One of the California Pacifica stations is picked us up.
[00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:50.060]   - Great.
[00:35:50.060 --> 00:35:52.140]   - And it airs on Sunday out there.
[00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:53.540]   - It's a really fun show.
[00:35:53.540 --> 00:35:55.540]   I'd like to be back on it sometime soon if I can.
[00:35:55.540 --> 00:35:56.700]   - We'll get you on at A-stack.
[00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:58.060]   - Technology Bites.
[00:35:58.060 --> 00:36:00.460]   Also with us Harry McCracken from the technology,
[00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:01.300]   technologyizer.
[00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:02.420]   I keep leaving out the Z.
[00:36:02.420 --> 00:36:03.420]   - People do that sometimes.
[00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:05.380]   - Technology, he is the technologyizer.
[00:36:05.380 --> 00:36:09.620]   Technologizer.com, Merlin Mann, old friend, good buddy.
[00:36:09.620 --> 00:36:10.980]   What was the Steely Dan thing?
[00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:12.140]   - I was standing with him, I was totally cool.
[00:36:12.140 --> 00:36:13.180]   He looked like Steely Dan.
[00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:14.580]   (laughing)
[00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:15.420]   - What?
[00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:16.260]   - They just, yeah, both of them.
[00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:17.100]   - Both of them did.
[00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:18.940]   They looked like Steely Dan, you're right.
[00:36:18.940 --> 00:36:19.820]   - And even think of that.
[00:36:19.820 --> 00:36:22.220]   That was the era we all looked like Steely Dan in those days.
[00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:23.540]   - You know what the deal is with that haircut.
[00:36:23.540 --> 00:36:24.860]   - No, we all looked like that.
[00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:26.020]   - I was like, I should talk, but I'm just saying it.
[00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:27.380]   It looked like it like an, it's.
[00:36:27.380 --> 00:36:29.380]   - I look, you've got a picture of Ty's.
[00:36:29.380 --> 00:36:30.220]   - Yeah.
[00:36:30.220 --> 00:36:31.060]   - You had a, Ty likes it.
[00:36:31.060 --> 00:36:32.820]   - You had a picture of me in 1976.
[00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:33.820]   That's what I looked like too.
[00:36:33.820 --> 00:36:34.660]   - Yep.
[00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:35.740]   - We all looked that way.
[00:36:35.740 --> 00:36:37.340]   - It's fun to go back to that.
[00:36:37.340 --> 00:36:40.420]   I think you can find on YouTube the wind Steve announced
[00:36:40.420 --> 00:36:42.060]   the Mac I guess 1983.
[00:36:42.060 --> 00:36:42.900]   Was one of the analysis.
[00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:44.220]   - Oh yeah, he pulled it out.
[00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:46.380]   - And it's just, it's still, it's so much fun to watch.
[00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:47.580]   It's such a different kind of thing.
[00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:48.860]   It's a different Steve.
[00:36:48.860 --> 00:36:52.020]   I mean, he's looked so different at different times and
[00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:55.340]   he's still got that stupid bow tie and it looks awesome.
[00:36:55.340 --> 00:36:57.700]   And it's just, it's great to be in the room
[00:36:57.700 --> 00:36:59.900]   and see like how excited that guy is.
[00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:00.860]   And there's times when you,
[00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:02.940]   and not to go how's your graphic,
[00:37:02.940 --> 00:37:05.580]   but you see a little glint where he's like,
[00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:06.540]   this is pretty cool, isn't it?
[00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:07.380]   - Yeah.
[00:37:07.380 --> 00:37:08.220]   - No, yeah, totally see that.
[00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:09.340]   - When he holds up the iPad, he's not going.
[00:37:09.340 --> 00:37:10.180]   - You totally see that.
[00:37:10.180 --> 00:37:11.380]   - I hope this scales across the enterprise.
[00:37:11.380 --> 00:37:13.300]   He's going, this is awesome.
[00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:17.460]   - He also never took, he never missed an opportunity
[00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:19.140]   to take a little dig at Microsoft.
[00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:21.580]   Here's a little Steve Jobs kind of recently to--
[00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:22.420]   - I didn't, that feel.
[00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:24.780]   We've got cards and letters from lots of people
[00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:27.580]   that say that iTunes is their favorite app on Windows.
[00:37:27.580 --> 00:37:32.980]   But I mean, I knew you, I knew you,
[00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:35.540]   you know, I think here at D actually--
[00:37:35.540 --> 00:37:36.860]   - It's like giving a glass of ice water
[00:37:36.860 --> 00:37:37.860]   to somebody in hell.
[00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:39.940]   (laughing)
[00:37:39.940 --> 00:37:43.340]   - We'll have more with our panel in just a little bit.
[00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:46.180]   It's nice to see Steve in that mode.
[00:37:46.180 --> 00:37:47.020]   I love it.
[00:37:47.020 --> 00:37:49.940]   Maybe I think I can find that Steve Jobs
[00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:51.020]   introducing Macintosh.
[00:37:51.020 --> 00:37:52.340]   That's pretty good with the big boat tie.
[00:37:52.340 --> 00:37:53.380]   It's a pretty good moment.
[00:37:53.380 --> 00:37:55.300]   We will continue in just a bit to talk about,
[00:37:55.300 --> 00:37:56.740]   there is lots of other news as well,
[00:37:56.740 --> 00:37:58.220]   but I think there's no question,
[00:37:58.220 --> 00:38:00.980]   this is the story of not just the week,
[00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:02.540]   probably of the year.
[00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:05.740]   But first, before we go on, go to meeting,
[00:38:05.740 --> 00:38:08.260]   I want to talk a little bit about go to meeting now
[00:38:08.260 --> 00:38:09.700]   with HD faces.
[00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:11.700]   We've been using and recommending go to meeting
[00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:13.500]   for a long time, all our meetings,
[00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:15.420]   all our conference calls, our go to meeting,
[00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:16.940]   because of this great screen sharing.
[00:38:16.940 --> 00:38:18.700]   You can show people a PowerPoint presentation,
[00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:22.620]   or collaborate on a document together, you can train.
[00:38:22.620 --> 00:38:26.340]   But now they've added, and it's so mind-boggling,
[00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:31.340]   HD faces, you get video, high-def video,
[00:38:31.340 --> 00:38:32.300]   of your conferees.
[00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:34.700]   There's nothing like seeing the person you're in a meeting
[00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:36.460]   with and seeing them smile or nod,
[00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:38.180]   or fold their arms.
[00:38:38.180 --> 00:38:40.540]   Body language is so efficient,
[00:38:40.540 --> 00:38:42.780]   and it's so important to communication.
[00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:46.500]   That's why I love go to meeting with HD faces.
[00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:49.180]   A chance for you to see the people you meet with,
[00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:50.420]   let me turn off the sound on this,
[00:38:50.420 --> 00:38:51.660]   we don't have to listen to the piano music,
[00:38:51.660 --> 00:38:55.580]   but when you see the video in here, it's incredible.
[00:38:55.580 --> 00:38:57.340]   Just visit gotomeeting.com.

[00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:11.420]   So you, I can't explain it,
[00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:13.700]   but it really does transform meetings.
[00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:15.100]   It is really fantastic.

[00:39:27.420 --> 00:39:29.420]   All our meetings are go to meetings.
[00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:31.700]   I think that should be true for everyone.
[00:39:31.700 --> 00:39:36.540]   And we do thank them for their support of this week in tech.
[00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:38.580]   We've been having fun with Eileen and the Tri-Caster.
[00:39:38.580 --> 00:39:42.020]   Eileen, I gotta tell you, our producer Eileen
[00:39:42.020 --> 00:39:44.380]   is running the whole show.
[00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:47.580]   I often say that one of the ideas that we had to make TWIT
[00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:51.020]   financially feasible is instead of having,
[00:39:51.020 --> 00:39:52.100]   you know, a couple people in front of the camera
[00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:54.020]   and two dozen people behind the camera,
[00:39:54.020 --> 00:39:57.300]   we have four big minds here, all the content here,
[00:39:57.300 --> 00:40:00.340]   and one person is doing the job of about 20
[00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:01.620]   back there as a TD,
[00:40:01.620 --> 00:40:03.940]   and of course you couldn't do it without that Tri-Caster 850.
[00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:05.940]   Give me a Tri-Caster transition.
[00:40:05.940 --> 00:40:08.060]   Watch this, she's really good at this.
[00:40:08.060 --> 00:40:11.140]   She's sitting there, I don't know, she's like at the battleship.
[00:40:11.140 --> 00:40:12.660]   She's like a lactica.
[00:40:12.660 --> 00:40:15.180]   She's got surrounded by key boards.
[00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:16.900]   - Here we go. - All right.
[00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:17.740]   Whoa.
[00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:19.060]   - No!
[00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:20.500]   - And I didn't have the audio, one more time.
[00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:21.820]   - Let's do one more time.
[00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:23.260]   - Yeah.
[00:40:23.260 --> 00:40:26.020]   That's that new tech Tri-Caster 850 extreme.
[00:40:26.020 --> 00:40:27.940]   We are using the extreme and it really is what makes it
[00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:30.500]   possible for us to do all of the stuff we do here
[00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:31.540]   with a one man operation.
[00:40:31.540 --> 00:40:33.100]   It's basically a TV truck in a box.
[00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:36.700]   One person, one man, one woman can do lower thirds,
[00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:38.940]   can do all the transitions, all the graphics.
[00:40:38.940 --> 00:40:40.580]   We were even having, I don't know what we were doing,
[00:40:40.580 --> 00:40:42.140]   we were making my lower third go like this.
[00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:43.580]   - Oh yeah, we were twisting it,
[00:40:43.580 --> 00:40:46.860]   but this one's a better Tri-Caster.
[00:40:46.860 --> 00:40:49.060]   - Let's see, another Tri-Caster transition.
[00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:50.980]   (laughing)
[00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:53.060]   - No, from Tri-Caster.
[00:40:53.060 --> 00:40:54.460]   - Anyway, thanks to the folks at New Tech
[00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:55.980]   for making that possible, New Tech.
[00:40:55.980 --> 00:40:59.740]   AnnieWTK.com, if you're looking at video production,
[00:40:59.740 --> 00:41:02.980]   this is the way of the future.
[00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:04.460]   It's the only way we could do what we're doing.
[00:41:04.460 --> 00:41:06.420]   You at five by five is all audio, right?
[00:41:06.420 --> 00:41:08.020]   You guys don't do video.
[00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:09.620]   Is that why you like him better?
[00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:10.460]   Is that why you like Dan?
[00:41:10.460 --> 00:41:11.300]   - I don't like anybody.
[00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:13.060]   - You like Dan better because he doesn't make you
[00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:13.900]   get on camera.
[00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:15.740]   - No, no.
[00:41:15.740 --> 00:41:18.660]   I'll, you know, most of my friends are, you know,
[00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:20.620]   very unpleasant and not attractive,
[00:41:20.620 --> 00:41:21.460]   but good at meeting.
[00:41:21.460 --> 00:41:22.380]   I wouldn't want to look at all my friends.
[00:41:22.380 --> 00:41:23.220]   I don't even know how you do that.
[00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:24.220]   (laughing)
[00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:25.060]   - You wouldn't want to see him.
[00:41:25.060 --> 00:41:26.780]   - No, I may as well come with some kind of special issue.
[00:41:26.780 --> 00:41:28.140]   You know, I can't, here's you go capture this.
[00:41:28.140 --> 00:41:30.340]   Platinum version, may as your friends look better.
[00:41:30.340 --> 00:41:31.180]   - Oh, that's a good idea.
[00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:32.020]   - Maybe a little less HD.
[00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:32.860]   Maybe you don't see it.
[00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:33.700]   - That's a good idea.
[00:41:33.700 --> 00:41:34.540]   - That's a really good idea.
[00:41:34.540 --> 00:41:36.140]   - Can I just say, Lio last time I hit some of you
[00:41:36.140 --> 00:41:37.900]   with the HD, we got tons of makeup.
[00:41:37.900 --> 00:41:39.380]   I got no makeup today.
[00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:41.380]   - I have a makeup room, but I don't have a makeup artist.
[00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:42.780]   - Well, you and I, we would look like Harold Lloyd
[00:41:42.780 --> 00:41:43.780]   by the time we got on camera.
[00:41:43.780 --> 00:41:44.620]   - I know.
[00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:45.460]   - Oh, you're talking about it, but in Canada.
[00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:46.300]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:47.540]   - They airbrush you.
[00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:50.220]   (imitates whooshing)
[00:41:50.220 --> 00:41:51.060]   - I miss that.
[00:41:51.060 --> 00:41:51.900]   My pores are large.
[00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:52.740]   (laughing)
[00:41:52.740 --> 00:41:54.940]   - Irene Tien.
[00:41:54.940 --> 00:41:56.500]   Do you know who she is?
[00:41:56.500 --> 00:41:58.860]   She's @ Irene on Twitter.
[00:41:58.860 --> 00:42:00.820]   - Oh.
[00:42:00.820 --> 00:42:02.300]   - And when the Irene Hurricane started to,
[00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:05.820]   she's been Irene on Twitter since 2006.
[00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:07.540]   When the hurricane started coming,
[00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:08.860]   for some reason people just assumed
[00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:10.220]   that she was the hurricane.
[00:42:10.220 --> 00:42:12.300]   (laughing)
[00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:13.540]   Naturally.
[00:42:13.540 --> 00:42:17.420]   - So apparently a big upsurge in the number of messages
[00:42:17.420 --> 00:42:19.500]   she was getting, someone with a handle,
[00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:24.500]   Caramel Dream said, "Dear @ Irene, can you like stop, please?"
[00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:26.660]   From @BroadwayAllDay.
[00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:29.660]   "Hey @ Irene, can you make a hard right for us?
[00:42:29.660 --> 00:42:32.460]   There's this triangle in Bermuda, I think you'd love."
[00:42:32.460 --> 00:42:33.540]   (laughing)
[00:42:33.540 --> 00:42:36.340]   So she posts, by the way, tweeting @ Irene
[00:42:36.340 --> 00:42:39.220]   doesn't deliver messages to the hurricane, sorry.
[00:42:39.220 --> 00:42:41.340]   - I got another one for you, just related to that.
[00:42:41.340 --> 00:42:42.540]   You guys, if you ever used that iOS,
[00:42:42.540 --> 00:42:45.700]   great iOS app called Elements, my friend Justin makes that.
[00:42:45.700 --> 00:42:47.500]   And unfortunately, he had the bad fortune
[00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:50.340]   to be early enough on Twitter that he is @Justin.
[00:42:50.340 --> 00:42:52.700]   - Oh, don't be a Justin.
[00:42:52.700 --> 00:42:56.020]   - So there's a certain very goofily co-op young man
[00:42:56.020 --> 00:42:57.300]   to whom many messages are sent
[00:42:57.300 --> 00:42:58.580]   that actually end up in Justins,
[00:42:58.580 --> 00:43:00.020]   'cause they think he's Justin Bieber.
[00:43:00.020 --> 00:43:00.860]   - Of course they do,
[00:43:00.860 --> 00:43:03.060]   'cause how could anybody besides Justin Bieber be @Justin?
[00:43:03.060 --> 00:43:04.260]   - The Tamarity. - The Tamarity.
[00:43:04.260 --> 00:43:05.700]   - The Tamarity.
[00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:06.900]   - So, anyway, have fun, Justin.
[00:43:06.900 --> 00:43:08.060]   I just got you some more followers.
[00:43:08.060 --> 00:43:09.580]   (laughing)
[00:43:09.580 --> 00:43:10.820]   - Nice hair elements.
[00:43:10.820 --> 00:43:14.380]   - Does his bio say I am not Justin Bieber?
[00:43:14.380 --> 00:43:16.060]   - Well, we talked about, I think for a while,
[00:43:16.060 --> 00:43:17.380]   he was screwing with people.
[00:43:17.380 --> 00:43:18.500]   - He said like, "I am Justin."
[00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:20.900]   - Yeah, say I can't reply to your two-dump drunk
[00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:23.140]   or whatever, you know, just come mess with him a little bit.
[00:43:23.140 --> 00:43:25.460]   - He says, "Currently in exile at Justin W
[00:43:25.460 --> 00:43:26.900]   "because of a teen pop star."
[00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:28.420]   So I guess he's had to abandon.
[00:43:28.420 --> 00:43:30.060]   - Oh, yes, that's true.
[00:43:30.060 --> 00:43:31.660]   - He's had to abandon it.
[00:43:31.660 --> 00:43:33.140]   No, he's still posting, it looks like.
[00:43:33.140 --> 00:43:34.300]   - He was kidding. - Like that rain gave up
[00:43:34.300 --> 00:43:35.940]   and it just started retweeting stuff
[00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:37.900]   for lighting into the hurricane.
[00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:39.100]   - Well, don't worry, it'll move on.
[00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:39.940]   What's the next one?
[00:43:39.940 --> 00:43:41.300]   What comes after I, J?
[00:43:41.300 --> 00:43:42.460]   - I'm Justin. - I could be...
[00:43:42.460 --> 00:43:44.260]   Hurricane Justin. - Sure.
[00:43:44.260 --> 00:43:45.820]   - Wow.
[00:43:45.820 --> 00:43:48.180]   He could be double whammy for poor Justin.
[00:43:48.180 --> 00:43:49.980]   - I'm, hey, I'm a big fan.
[00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:53.260]   Could you come to my town and also also not destroy it?
[00:43:53.260 --> 00:43:54.100]   (laughing)
[00:43:54.100 --> 00:43:55.460]   - I actually love you. - I actually love elements.
[00:43:55.460 --> 00:43:58.860]   It's really a wonderful, wonderful app for iPad,
[00:43:58.860 --> 00:44:00.860]   particularly, but you can use it on the iPhone as well.
[00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:02.340]   Sprint speaking of iPhone,
[00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:05.740]   maybe getting the iPhone 5.
[00:44:05.740 --> 00:44:06.740]   I think that would be great.
[00:44:06.740 --> 00:44:07.820]   Now all we need is T-Mobile
[00:44:07.820 --> 00:44:10.200]   and you'd have the complete set.
[00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:16.060]   This is from Mr. Dwight Silverman's tech blog.
[00:44:16.060 --> 00:44:17.900]   How did you hear about this, Dwight?
[00:44:17.900 --> 00:44:19.060]   Is this the journey? - Oh, I stole it
[00:44:19.060 --> 00:44:20.660]   from some other blog the way I actually.
[00:44:20.660 --> 00:44:21.500]   (laughing)
[00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:22.820]   - The Wall Street Journal, I think was the one that--
[00:44:22.820 --> 00:44:23.660]   - The Journal. - The Journal
[00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:24.500]   is the Wall Street Journal in this case.
[00:44:24.500 --> 00:44:26.420]   - You guys think the Journal is reliable in the,
[00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:28.260]   you seem to have a lot of Apple rumors.
[00:44:28.260 --> 00:44:30.020]   Are they, they must have a source?
[00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:32.580]   - Yeah, and there's been some speculation
[00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:35.020]   that their source is Steve Jobs.
[00:44:35.020 --> 00:44:37.340]   - They're the house organ for Apple, basically.
[00:44:37.340 --> 00:44:38.180]   - Right.
[00:44:38.180 --> 00:44:39.180]   - I feel like the ball-- - You know, like the ball--
[00:44:39.180 --> 00:44:40.780]   - Bearded Boing Boing, like they,
[00:44:40.780 --> 00:44:42.420]   stuff just ends up there early 'cause people wanna--
[00:44:42.420 --> 00:44:44.060]   - Oh, Dwight's the ball Bearded Boing Boing Boing.
[00:44:44.060 --> 00:44:45.140]   - Oh, my apologies, Dwight.
[00:44:45.140 --> 00:44:46.780]   (laughing)
[00:44:46.780 --> 00:44:47.620]   - But they've, you know, they've become like
[00:44:47.620 --> 00:44:48.900]   the sink for links, you think?
[00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:52.100]   Like people won't wall to link to their thing?
[00:44:52.100 --> 00:44:53.660]   - Well, it's not wall to--
[00:44:53.660 --> 00:44:55.260]   - No, no, it's not wall. - It's the journal.
[00:44:55.260 --> 00:44:56.700]   - It's the formal journal part.
[00:44:56.700 --> 00:44:59.740]   - He's all things D and they're, you know.
[00:44:59.740 --> 00:45:01.180]   - Well, he still writes for them,
[00:45:01.180 --> 00:45:02.740]   but he's been doing it for 20 years.
[00:45:02.740 --> 00:45:04.980]   - That kind of is true, if they say it's happening
[00:45:04.980 --> 00:45:06.340]   in a way that I just-- - I do too.
[00:45:06.340 --> 00:45:08.380]   - For '99, so-- - It gives a credibility.
[00:45:08.380 --> 00:45:10.540]   It's more than Mac rumors, let's say.
[00:45:10.540 --> 00:45:11.380]   - Yeah.
[00:45:11.380 --> 00:45:12.460]   - The Journal is like-- - Well, it said,
[00:45:12.460 --> 00:45:14.860]   back in a year ago, I wrote that I thought
[00:45:14.860 --> 00:45:19.860]   that with the iPhone 4, that all four carriers would end up
[00:45:19.860 --> 00:45:22.140]   with that device at that point.
[00:45:22.140 --> 00:45:23.980]   And I said I was just really speculating,
[00:45:23.980 --> 00:45:26.780]   it kind of made sense, but I think that may happen this year.
[00:45:26.780 --> 00:45:28.580]   I mean, I think you'll see T-Mobile get it
[00:45:28.580 --> 00:45:32.220]   and I think you'll also see Sprint get it.
[00:45:32.220 --> 00:45:33.900]   Although T-Mobile could get it by default
[00:45:33.900 --> 00:45:36.140]   if it does end up getting-- - It's AT&T.
[00:45:36.140 --> 00:45:37.780]   - If it's AT&T, yeah.
[00:45:37.780 --> 00:45:39.980]   - I think you make the point, I think this is probably true,
[00:45:39.980 --> 00:45:41.380]   that the rumors have been strong
[00:45:41.380 --> 00:45:45.940]   that there's going to be a unified CDMA, GSM chipset
[00:45:45.940 --> 00:45:49.500]   that will allow the iPhone to work on both carriers,
[00:45:49.500 --> 00:45:53.020]   or all four carriers because they'll support both technologies.
[00:45:53.020 --> 00:45:55.460]   And I think that that's an Apple supply thing
[00:45:55.460 --> 00:45:57.220]   as much as anything else.
[00:45:57.220 --> 00:45:59.460]   I mean, it means that they have one assembly line,
[00:45:59.460 --> 00:46:03.860]   it means they have one skew, they're able to sell both
[00:46:03.860 --> 00:46:07.700]   out of the same crate of boxes that come in.
[00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:09.620]   It just simplifies things for them
[00:46:09.620 --> 00:46:12.220]   and that just makes a lot of sense.
[00:46:12.220 --> 00:46:16.860]   - Hey, speaking of 20 years, this guy, oh, 20 years old,
[00:46:16.860 --> 00:46:21.180]   sucks the penguin, this is the 20th anniversary of Linux.
[00:46:21.180 --> 00:46:23.740]   Do you think Linux has made its mark,
[00:46:23.740 --> 00:46:27.060]   or is it for nerds only?
[00:46:27.060 --> 00:46:27.900]   - Mm-hmm.
[00:46:27.900 --> 00:46:30.780]   - Like Linux Linux, not just Unix.
[00:46:30.780 --> 00:46:31.940]   - Linux Linux.
[00:46:31.940 --> 00:46:33.220]   - I don't know a lot about it, but boy,
[00:46:33.220 --> 00:46:34.980]   it sure seems to have made a big mark.
[00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:36.380]   There was that time in the late '90s
[00:46:36.380 --> 00:46:38.100]   when it really felt like there was that big surge
[00:46:38.100 --> 00:46:40.940]   for the enterprise, but she's, you know what?
[00:46:40.940 --> 00:46:42.260]   I don't know enough about different lenses.
[00:46:42.260 --> 00:46:43.100]   - I think it's a huge influence.
[00:46:43.100 --> 00:46:45.780]   - I think, I mean, look, we use it every day,
[00:46:45.780 --> 00:46:46.700]   every time you go to a website,
[00:46:46.700 --> 00:46:48.980]   our website and many others, you're on Linux.
[00:46:48.980 --> 00:46:51.820]   But I think really the people judge it based on
[00:46:51.820 --> 00:46:54.020]   whether Linux ever got to the desktop.
[00:46:54.020 --> 00:46:55.260]   - Right, that was always the dream.
[00:46:55.260 --> 00:46:56.100]   - And it never did.
[00:46:56.100 --> 00:46:58.380]   - It was always like a year away from having a huge impact
[00:46:58.380 --> 00:47:01.620]   and it hasn't had that impact with normal people,
[00:47:01.620 --> 00:47:04.420]   but so many people use Linux without milling it
[00:47:04.420 --> 00:47:06.780]   because Android is Linux.
[00:47:06.780 --> 00:47:08.260]   - Android's Linux, you're right.
[00:47:08.260 --> 00:47:09.300]   It's every one. - Half a million
[00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:10.620]   new Linux users a day.
[00:47:10.620 --> 00:47:12.100]   - Yeah, it turned out to be something which--
[00:47:12.100 --> 00:47:12.940]   - That's a good boy.
[00:47:12.940 --> 00:47:15.420]   - This profoundly important, but you just don't,
[00:47:15.420 --> 00:47:17.100]   you're not aware you're using it for the most part.
[00:47:17.100 --> 00:47:19.260]   - It's infrastructure more than anything else.
[00:47:19.260 --> 00:47:24.740]   Was August 25th, 1991, that a Finnish computer science
[00:47:24.740 --> 00:47:28.660]   student, Linus Torvalds, first released,
[00:47:28.660 --> 00:47:31.620]   first announced to the world, it did it on, by the way.
[00:47:31.620 --> 00:47:32.500]   - So I'm not using it, right?
[00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:34.060]   - Using it, exactly.
[00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:35.220]   I think he said something like,
[00:47:35.220 --> 00:47:36.980]   I'm writing an operating system,
[00:47:36.980 --> 00:47:38.380]   it will be like Linux.
[00:47:38.380 --> 00:47:39.580]   Anybody want to help?
[00:47:39.580 --> 00:47:41.140]   Come on, you can help.
[00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:44.140]   Here's the, this is from the Linux Foundations,
[00:47:44.140 --> 00:47:45.500]   Linux History Gallery.
[00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:47.540]   Hello everybody out there using Linux.
[00:47:47.540 --> 00:47:50.020]   I'm doing a free operating system,
[00:47:50.020 --> 00:47:53.780]   just a hobby, won't be big and professional like a new
[00:47:53.780 --> 00:47:56.460]   for 386.80 clones.
[00:47:56.460 --> 00:47:58.700]   This has been brewing since April and it's starting,
[00:47:58.700 --> 00:47:59.780]   I'm starting to sound like a leopard car.
[00:47:59.780 --> 00:48:00.940]   - Team Mort Mort Mort.
[00:48:00.940 --> 00:48:02.100]   (laughing)
[00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:04.100]   - I just think you're very Swedish chef right now.
[00:48:04.100 --> 00:48:05.940]   (laughing)
[00:48:05.940 --> 00:48:06.780]   - I'm just watching.
[00:48:06.780 --> 00:48:07.980]   - Can Maryland's just,
[00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:09.420]   is eyeballs are getting bigger?
[00:48:09.420 --> 00:48:12.020]   - You guys missed like 35 minutes of Transylvania
[00:48:12.020 --> 00:48:13.300]   before the-- - Shit.
[00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:16.580]   - I'd like any feedback on things people like this like
[00:48:16.580 --> 00:48:20.980]   in Minux, as my OS resembles it somewhat.
[00:48:20.980 --> 00:48:23.100]   This is so cute.
[00:48:23.100 --> 00:48:25.580]   I've currently ported Bash and GCC
[00:48:25.580 --> 00:48:27.740]   and things seem to work.
[00:48:27.740 --> 00:48:28.580]   Wow.
[00:48:28.580 --> 00:48:30.620]   20 years isn't that long and yet,
[00:48:30.620 --> 00:48:33.180]   I doubt very much.
[00:48:33.180 --> 00:48:34.940]   The thing that Linus did that was really cool,
[00:48:34.940 --> 00:48:37.660]   he trademarked the name so that he would be the one who could
[00:48:37.660 --> 00:48:39.180]   say this is Linux, this isn't Linux.
[00:48:39.180 --> 00:48:40.540]   I think that was actually smart,
[00:48:40.540 --> 00:48:44.380]   but he didn't patent or in any way encumber the source code,
[00:48:44.380 --> 00:48:45.860]   he gave it away basically.
[00:48:45.860 --> 00:48:47.060]   - Stalman did the same thing, right?
[00:48:47.060 --> 00:48:47.900]   Yeah, I think he has a service.
[00:48:47.900 --> 00:48:49.820]   - Well, does he have a service marker?
[00:48:49.820 --> 00:48:50.660]   - Yes. - Nobody else
[00:48:50.660 --> 00:48:51.660]   and nobody else can.
[00:48:51.660 --> 00:48:53.900]   - Yeah, I think that's smart because then you can at least
[00:48:53.900 --> 00:48:56.540]   say what is Linux and what isn't Linux,
[00:48:56.540 --> 00:48:57.860]   otherwise we'd have a million,
[00:48:57.860 --> 00:49:01.360]   you know, pseudo Linux is out there.
[00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:05.300]   Anyway, and Tux the Penguin says,
[00:49:05.300 --> 00:49:06.200]   this is by the way,
[00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:10.360]   Penguins will never see a Penguin with yellow feet.
[00:49:10.360 --> 00:49:12.280]   - You want?
[00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:13.120]   - No, this is a not.
[00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:15.280]   - I think you can make that an Emacs, I think.
[00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:16.120]   (laughing)
[00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:17.480]   - Not occurring in nature.
[00:49:17.480 --> 00:49:19.240]   - Sir, yellow feet, dirty yellow.
[00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:21.920]   - I think if you were to check the Wikipedia,
[00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:22.920]   it's here.
[00:49:22.920 --> 00:49:24.480]   - There are no yellow.
[00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:25.480]   - That's your question.
[00:49:25.480 --> 00:49:26.320]   - Yes sir.
[00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:29.640]   - Why didn't the red hat Linux-ish things take off?
[00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:30.560]   - As desktop?
[00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:33.340]   - Well, as like for enterprise desktop things,
[00:49:33.340 --> 00:49:34.960]   why, that seemed like that was like a giant thing.
[00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:38.440]   - I think I think this is a software patent issue,
[00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:41.760]   fundamentally, and the fact that SCO sued,
[00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:43.200]   of course a failed lawsuit ultimately,
[00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:44.600]   but one that went on for a long time,
[00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:47.560]   and then the Microsoft then licensed
[00:49:47.560 --> 00:49:49.200]   and indemnified people and said,
[00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:50.960]   well if you buy our products,
[00:49:50.960 --> 00:49:52.560]   you don't have to worry about getting sued.
[00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:54.760]   Really create, and this was intentional on Microsoft's part,
[00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:57.680]   really created this perception that it might be dangerous
[00:49:57.680 --> 00:50:00.360]   to use Linux, and I think that's a lot of it.
[00:50:00.360 --> 00:50:03.880]   I think that Linux, when you talk about in the enterprise,
[00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:05.160]   I think that that was one of the things
[00:50:05.160 --> 00:50:08.240]   that really kind of put a chill on it, unfortunately.
[00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:11.360]   - So why didn't that put a chill on the use of it
[00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:15.600]   as server software, or particularly web server software,
[00:50:15.600 --> 00:50:20.040]   'cause even in large enterprises that use windows
[00:50:20.040 --> 00:50:22.560]   on the desktop, you have Linux everywhere,
[00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:24.280]   kind of on the back end, right?
[00:50:24.280 --> 00:50:26.800]   - I think that they swallowed their concerns
[00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:28.480]   because of reliability.
[00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:29.960]   - It just works, right?
[00:50:29.960 --> 00:50:30.800]   - And it's free.
[00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:32.400]   - And it's free, certainly.
[00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:35.240]   - And I think also it's a little less foreground.
[00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:36.960]   So maybe a little less risky.
[00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:38.720]   - It's not as hard to change, too.
[00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:39.880]   My bank, I'm sorry to interrupt you,
[00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:43.200]   but my bank still uses, I think these windows 2000.
[00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:46.040]   Like, I mean, no, it's very costly to upgrade.
[00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:48.080]   It works, right?
[00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:50.400]   I mean, I don't know if it works for that,
[00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:52.040]   but it works for them, you know what I'm saying?
[00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:53.880]   And I wonder if that's a part of it though.
[00:50:53.880 --> 00:50:56.680]   - I think you're still financial services that use OS too.
[00:50:56.680 --> 00:50:57.760]   - A lot of them are using web browsers
[00:50:57.760 --> 00:50:59.080]   using Internet Explorer a lot.
[00:50:59.080 --> 00:51:00.320]   - There are ATMs that run OS too,
[00:51:00.320 --> 00:51:02.120]   and don't underestimate the importance
[00:51:02.120 --> 00:51:04.320]   of Microsoft Office, whether you love it or hate it.
[00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:05.400]   - Right.
[00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:07.280]   - If you want to run OS. - Open Office is no clone, is it?
[00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:08.640]   - No, not at all.
[00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:11.440]   And I think Office is almost more important
[00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:13.800]   to businesses and Windows is.
[00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:15.960]   - Actually, that's a very good point.
[00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:16.880]   That's a very good point.
[00:51:16.880 --> 00:51:18.360]   They buy it for Office.
[00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:22.760]   Let's see, has Chrome been crashing more often
[00:51:22.760 --> 00:51:24.200]   on the Mac for you?
[00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:25.320]   - On Lion, yes, totally.
[00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:26.880]   - It crashes a lot of Lion.
[00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:28.560]   I get that aw snap all the time.
[00:51:28.560 --> 00:51:29.720]   - No, I do.
[00:51:29.720 --> 00:51:32.040]   - Have you changed from Chrome?
[00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:33.560]   - I've been jumping back and forth,
[00:51:33.560 --> 00:51:34.960]   but I mean, I usually just refresh.
[00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:36.520]   But yeah, I'm using it a little more.
[00:51:36.520 --> 00:51:37.360]   - Yeah, well, I just close it.
[00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:38.440]   - Do you ever watch your processes in Chrome?
[00:51:38.440 --> 00:51:39.720]   - No, should I?
[00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:41.160]   - Well, I mean, it's got, not protecting me.
[00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:42.400]   - How do I watch my processes?
[00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:44.240]   - There's a nerd bit under the little wrench,
[00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:45.200]   but what I did was to be honest,
[00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:47.760]   anything that I could accomplish with a bookmarklet,
[00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:50.280]   I took out the extension,
[00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:52.240]   because I mean, that's us all running all the time.
[00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:54.120]   If all I need is to post something to Pinboard,
[00:51:54.120 --> 00:51:55.840]   I don't really need a full expression for that.
[00:51:55.840 --> 00:51:56.840]   And it helped a little bit.
[00:51:56.840 --> 00:51:58.120]   So I just got stuck. - I have too much crap
[00:51:58.120 --> 00:51:59.360]   running on this thing.
[00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:00.560]   - I still have it with Firefox.
[00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:01.400]   - I still have it with my friends.
[00:52:01.400 --> 00:52:02.240]   - That's like Firefox.
[00:52:02.240 --> 00:52:04.040]   - Got to delete things from my hard drive, you know.
[00:52:04.040 --> 00:52:04.880]   - Yeah.
[00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:07.200]   By the way, David Allen's gonna be our guest on Wednesday
[00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:08.440]   for triangulation.
[00:52:08.440 --> 00:52:09.280]   Why don't you come up and you can help us with it.
[00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:10.120]   - He's a nice man.
[00:52:10.120 --> 00:52:10.960]   I don't want to step on his thing.
[00:52:10.960 --> 00:52:11.800]   He's a very nice man.
[00:52:11.800 --> 00:52:13.080]   We had a nice exchange last week.
[00:52:13.080 --> 00:52:15.240]   He's, David Allen, the author of "Gaining Things Done",
[00:52:15.240 --> 00:52:16.080]   big fan.
[00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:16.920]   - GTD.
[00:52:16.920 --> 00:52:17.760]   - Great guy.
[00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:19.560]   - That's really where you made your bones, isn't it?
[00:52:19.560 --> 00:52:22.400]   - Yeah, I think that my fondness,
[00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:23.880]   so 43 photos started.
[00:52:23.880 --> 00:52:26.200]   I think obviously my own,
[00:52:26.200 --> 00:52:29.000]   gosh, how much I rely on getting things done.
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:30.760]   But also the fact that a lot of people
[00:52:30.760 --> 00:52:32.120]   would struggle with the implementation
[00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:33.960]   of "Gaining Things Done" after "No Fault of David"
[00:52:33.960 --> 00:52:35.960]   is partly 'cause we're just fiddly idiots who just need photos.
[00:52:35.960 --> 00:52:37.960]   - No, I think it's 'cause we like to mess around
[00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:40.720]   with the implementation instead of doing something.
[00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:42.480]   - Like, which note your hand.
[00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:43.880]   But no, that guy's the real deal.
[00:52:43.880 --> 00:52:45.120]   And he'll tell you, like, you can do this,
[00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:46.840]   it started out getting things done.
[00:52:46.840 --> 00:52:48.520]   And if you're a nerd, you're struggling.
[00:52:48.520 --> 00:52:51.440]   - You still use an Omni Focus, is that your choice?
[00:52:51.440 --> 00:52:52.720]   - I play with a lot of my,
[00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:55.000]   I recommend different ones to different people
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:57.120]   depending on what their deal is, but that's what I use.
[00:52:57.120 --> 00:52:59.880]   But David Allen designed, not to show GTD,
[00:52:59.880 --> 00:53:02.600]   but like he designed it to be used with paper and a pen.
[00:53:02.600 --> 00:53:05.200]   - Right, that's where 43 folders comes from.
[00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:06.920]   You make 43 folders.
[00:53:06.920 --> 00:53:08.160]   - Ticlify, yeah.
[00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:09.160]   - Yeah, like, what is it?
[00:53:09.160 --> 00:53:11.080]   It's a 13.
[00:53:11.080 --> 00:53:13.120]   - It's 12 months and 30 days.
[00:53:13.120 --> 00:53:13.960]   - 30 days, that's right.
[00:53:13.960 --> 00:53:14.800]   - And then you just keep moving it.
[00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:16.920]   It's some of the kind of stuff nerds love.
[00:53:16.920 --> 00:53:17.760]   - 12 months.
[00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:18.600]   - Good man.
[00:53:18.600 --> 00:53:19.920]   - That's only 42 folders.
[00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:21.600]   - Open PCalk, any PCalk.
[00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:23.560]   Oh, once for Elijah.
[00:53:23.560 --> 00:53:26.560]   Old Testament jokes.
[00:53:26.560 --> 00:53:27.920]   (laughing)
[00:53:27.920 --> 00:53:28.920]   I got nothing.
[00:53:28.920 --> 00:53:30.240]   It's a nice to be back.
[00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:34.720]   Larry Page says the Wall Street Journal yesterday.
[00:53:34.720 --> 00:53:38.560]   No, God, this is, you know, I, I, I,
[00:53:38.560 --> 00:53:41.800]   maybe this is just me, but I just cannot get upset about this.
[00:53:41.800 --> 00:53:46.960]   That Google for years was selling ads on ads,
[00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:51.120]   sensor ad words, I should say, to Canadian pharmacies
[00:53:51.120 --> 00:53:54.120]   targeting American consumers.
[00:53:54.120 --> 00:53:56.400]   And he did nothing about it.
[00:53:56.400 --> 00:54:00.240]   The Google agreed, admitted to doing that
[00:54:00.240 --> 00:54:03.880]   and they paid a half billion dollar fine.
[00:54:03.880 --> 00:54:08.800]   But apparently at least one attorney general
[00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:12.160]   from Rhode Island and the Department of Justice Day,
[00:54:12.160 --> 00:54:14.440]   but Larry Page knew, he knew.
[00:54:14.440 --> 00:54:18.000]   Can you get, to me, I feel like,
[00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:20.640]   bully for him.
[00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:23.120]   Let's get some more Canadian pharmacy ads on the internet.
[00:54:23.120 --> 00:54:24.360]   What the hell's wrong with that?
[00:54:24.360 --> 00:54:25.440]   Why do you think people want
[00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:26.800]   Canadians in pharmacy ads?
[00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:29.320]   'Cause it's cheaper to buy the drug from Canada.
[00:54:29.320 --> 00:54:30.440]   And illegal.
[00:54:30.440 --> 00:54:32.400]   It's illegal, I understand it's illegal.
[00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:34.680]   I mean, it's illegal because big pharmacy
[00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:37.520]   wants to charge us more than they charge in Canada, right?
[00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:38.720]   For the same drug.
[00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:41.080]   I think the bar is higher for Google than some companies
[00:54:41.080 --> 00:54:43.560]   because of the whole, don't be evil thing.
[00:54:43.560 --> 00:54:44.680]   But it's not evil.
[00:54:44.680 --> 00:54:48.720]   Evil is being a pharmaceutical company
[00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:51.960]   and charging more money to Americans because you can.
[00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:53.600]   I bet Google did not use that argument.
[00:54:53.600 --> 00:54:56.280]   But I agree with you and I understand
[00:54:56.280 --> 00:54:59.000]   if the attorney general was staring me in the face,
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:01.040]   I'd say, yes sir, I'm sorry, here's Ava Billion.
[00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:03.960]   But I just think that that's big pharma
[00:55:03.960 --> 00:55:06.080]   who's really the evil one here.
[00:55:06.080 --> 00:55:09.120]   - Google, there was a story, I forget who wrote it this week
[00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:12.320]   that where somebody explained what don't be evil means
[00:55:12.320 --> 00:55:16.280]   and it doesn't necessarily mean the kind of thing
[00:55:16.280 --> 00:55:17.120]   you're talking about.
[00:55:17.120 --> 00:55:17.960]   - Right.
[00:55:17.960 --> 00:55:20.040]   - It's don't be evil to your customers,
[00:55:20.040 --> 00:55:21.440]   be good to your customers,
[00:55:21.440 --> 00:55:23.720]   which is your users, your searchers.
[00:55:23.720 --> 00:55:26.880]   So things that look like it's Google being predatory
[00:55:26.880 --> 00:55:30.320]   towards other companies, if you look at one of the,
[00:55:30.320 --> 00:55:33.760]   even the side effect of the motivation for them to do that
[00:55:33.760 --> 00:55:36.600]   is that it benefits their customers in some way.
[00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:40.520]   If you look at that part of it, then it is not being evil
[00:55:40.520 --> 00:55:45.240]   and having ads for cheaper drugs on your website,
[00:55:45.240 --> 00:55:46.760]   not evil, right?
[00:55:46.760 --> 00:55:48.080]   - Well.
[00:55:48.080 --> 00:55:51.240]   - If you're looking at it in terms of a US consumer
[00:55:51.240 --> 00:55:53.120]   who wants to know you left, use Google to do that.
[00:55:53.120 --> 00:55:55.840]   - I guess the question is, are these drugs somehow dangerous?
[00:55:55.840 --> 00:55:57.920]   No, they're the same.
[00:55:57.920 --> 00:55:59.920]   They're from, well, they're from, okay,
[00:55:59.920 --> 00:56:01.240]   so here's the issue.
[00:56:01.240 --> 00:56:05.320]   There is a little loophole in the Canadian law
[00:56:05.320 --> 00:56:08.920]   that says, so these drugs were neither FDA approved
[00:56:08.920 --> 00:56:12.920]   nor Canadian drug regulation approved.
[00:56:12.920 --> 00:56:15.240]   There was a little loophole that said Canadian pharmacies,
[00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:17.200]   if they are shipping the drugs to the US,
[00:56:17.200 --> 00:56:19.400]   are not subject to Canadian regulation.
[00:56:19.400 --> 00:56:21.760]   So they could be, they could have been dangerous.
[00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:23.480]   They could have been poison pills.
[00:56:23.480 --> 00:56:25.480]   But I don't think that they were.
[00:56:25.480 --> 00:56:27.800]   I think they were in fact the same exact drugs
[00:56:27.800 --> 00:56:30.600]   that the farmers sell us in the US for four or five.
[00:56:30.600 --> 00:56:33.560]   Don't people get on buses and drive to Canada
[00:56:33.560 --> 00:56:34.760]   to get their cancer medicines
[00:56:34.760 --> 00:56:36.360]   because it's so much cheaper there?
[00:56:36.360 --> 00:56:37.720]   - It's ridiculous.
[00:56:37.720 --> 00:56:39.280]   - And isn't that evil?
[00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:41.680]   - Well, it's crazy is, like, I hear from friends
[00:56:41.680 --> 00:56:44.520]   that there are, well, first of all,
[00:56:44.520 --> 00:56:46.880]   I don't wanna be like tin foil hat guy, but generic
[00:56:46.880 --> 00:56:48.960]   versus brand name, there's actually a huge difference
[00:56:48.960 --> 00:56:50.320]   in some kinds of things.
[00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:52.640]   I just know, I've tried some stuff that I take.
[00:56:52.640 --> 00:56:55.320]   I've tried different things that are--
[00:56:55.320 --> 00:56:56.840]   - I guess that's generic.
[00:56:56.840 --> 00:56:58.560]   - That's Tritera's really been working for you.
[00:56:58.560 --> 00:56:59.400]   You keep up the good work.
[00:56:59.400 --> 00:57:01.160]   - Well, that's a base player for Chicago,
[00:57:01.160 --> 00:57:02.680]   from British Tritera.
[00:57:02.680 --> 00:57:05.160]   But the thing is what's ludicrous,
[00:57:05.160 --> 00:57:07.160]   and I don't have an opinion on whether this is right or wrong
[00:57:07.160 --> 00:57:09.800]   or whatever, but it is crazy that you can get a brand name
[00:57:09.800 --> 00:57:11.920]   for sometimes like a tenth of what it costs
[00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:13.240]   for like, let me not just an error.
[00:57:13.240 --> 00:57:14.480]   - It strikes me.
[00:57:14.480 --> 00:57:17.440]   - There's some profit taking from the drug companies.
[00:57:17.440 --> 00:57:19.160]   - There's a little tangy.
[00:57:19.160 --> 00:57:21.400]   - Wait a minute, we came up with a different kind of,
[00:57:21.400 --> 00:57:23.400]   you know, container for it, so we get a new patent.
[00:57:23.400 --> 00:57:24.880]   No, but the thing is, I think Google,
[00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:26.560]   it's gonna be one of the things like eBay or any of those
[00:57:26.560 --> 00:57:27.920]   things where there are a platform from this.
[00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:30.600]   Can you imagine how many billions of ads they run every year?
[00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:33.480]   And the last thing in the world they wanna incur the wrath on
[00:57:33.480 --> 00:57:36.320]   is like suddenly becoming the people who have to filter
[00:57:36.320 --> 00:57:38.280]   each one of those for legality.
[00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:39.120]   - Well, that's a good point to--
[00:57:39.120 --> 00:57:41.320]   - Well, they vet them for relevance right now,
[00:57:41.320 --> 00:57:43.200]   but what would happen if Google,
[00:57:43.200 --> 00:57:45.360]   again, I don't have a, this is not a value judgment,
[00:57:45.360 --> 00:57:46.400]   but I bet they would happily go,
[00:57:46.400 --> 00:57:47.640]   sure, here's $500 million.
[00:57:47.640 --> 00:57:49.400]   Like, I so don't wanna have to figure out
[00:57:49.400 --> 00:57:51.400]   if this lady really does nails or is a hooker.
[00:57:51.400 --> 00:57:53.720]   Like, I so don't wanna have to like go track that day.
[00:57:53.720 --> 00:57:55.440]   - This is kind of analogous to the problem they have
[00:57:55.440 --> 00:57:58.320]   with YouTube, and they are protected in that case
[00:57:58.320 --> 00:58:00.040]   by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act,
[00:58:00.040 --> 00:58:02.680]   which says that they are a carrier,
[00:58:02.680 --> 00:58:04.840]   they have the safe harbor protection,
[00:58:04.840 --> 00:58:08.160]   that they don't have to vet everything on YouTube,
[00:58:08.160 --> 00:58:09.640]   they don't have to protect copyright holders,
[00:58:09.640 --> 00:58:11.640]   they nearly have to provide a mechanism
[00:58:11.640 --> 00:58:13.600]   for copyright holders to complain.
[00:58:13.600 --> 00:58:15.280]   Wouldn't it be kind of similar for these ads,
[00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:16.120]   or maybe not?
[00:58:16.120 --> 00:58:18.600]   - Does it, onerous, expect them to vet every ad
[00:58:18.600 --> 00:58:20.200]   for legality?
[00:58:20.200 --> 00:58:22.440]   - Well, supposedly they knew explicitly
[00:58:22.440 --> 00:58:23.520]   that they weren't legal.
[00:58:23.520 --> 00:58:25.680]   - Oh, new schmoo.
[00:58:25.680 --> 00:58:27.280]   - Also, chat room guy.
[00:58:27.280 --> 00:58:28.120]   - That is relevant.
[00:58:28.120 --> 00:58:31.280]   - Generics and name brands are not the same.
[00:58:31.280 --> 00:58:32.760]   - They're not, they're not the same chemical?
[00:58:32.760 --> 00:58:35.640]   - Ask one of those doctors about it.
[00:58:35.640 --> 00:58:38.400]   The quality control and generics are like, you know.
[00:58:38.400 --> 00:58:39.240]   - Really?
[00:58:39.240 --> 00:58:40.080]   - Oh, sure.
[00:58:40.080 --> 00:58:40.920]   - 'Cause I always--
[00:58:40.920 --> 00:58:41.760]   - It's not a meth lab or anything.
[00:58:41.760 --> 00:58:45.600]   - I always opt for the generic drug.
[00:58:45.600 --> 00:58:46.440]   - Well, it depends.
[00:58:46.440 --> 00:58:48.520]   If it's something like, this is,
[00:58:48.520 --> 00:58:50.120]   you should play the music.
[00:58:50.120 --> 00:58:51.520]   It's a rattle, I'm sorry.
[00:58:51.520 --> 00:58:53.720]   - No, it's not a rattle, it's interesting.
[00:58:53.720 --> 00:58:54.560]   - It's crazy though, 'cause you know,
[00:58:54.560 --> 00:58:55.400]   boy, you think about that.
[00:58:55.400 --> 00:58:56.760]   This has happened in some locations
[00:58:56.760 --> 00:58:58.480]   where they get, where there are places where they go like,
[00:58:58.480 --> 00:59:00.120]   "Oh my gosh, you've got to start policing
[00:59:00.120 --> 00:59:02.360]   "the weekly news ads for you."
[00:59:02.360 --> 00:59:03.360]   - How do you do that?
[00:59:03.360 --> 00:59:05.920]   - Well, that's the thing is, I bet you just think about
[00:59:05.920 --> 00:59:09.320]   how much of their revenue, I guess maybe not,
[00:59:09.320 --> 00:59:10.600]   but I imagine the pie graph--
[00:59:10.600 --> 00:59:11.440]   - They made a lot of money.
[00:59:11.440 --> 00:59:13.040]   - The goal goes pretty heavily toward AdSense.
[00:59:13.040 --> 00:59:13.880]   - They made a lot of money.
[00:59:13.880 --> 00:59:16.680]   - And by the way, there's the contention
[00:59:16.680 --> 00:59:20.040]   by the federal government that Google actually helped them.
[00:59:20.040 --> 00:59:22.240]   They like said, "Oh no, you want to put these ads here
[00:59:22.240 --> 00:59:23.560]   "and things like that."
[00:59:23.560 --> 00:59:25.840]   So they were actually, you know, kind of,
[00:59:25.840 --> 00:59:26.680]   maybe they were a little bit--
[00:59:26.680 --> 00:59:27.760]   - He's Google Voice.
[00:59:27.760 --> 00:59:28.600]   - I do.
[00:59:28.600 --> 00:59:29.440]   - I'm sorry I'm talking too much.
[00:59:29.440 --> 00:59:30.280]   - Love Google Voice.
[00:59:30.280 --> 00:59:31.120]   - I had a funny Google Voice experience this week.
[00:59:31.120 --> 00:59:32.280]   I got one of those mystery meat numbers,
[00:59:32.280 --> 00:59:33.520]   like I own an 800 number.
[00:59:33.520 --> 00:59:34.360]   And of course, the first thing I do,
[00:59:34.360 --> 00:59:37.720]   I grab it, I search for it on who called me or whatever.
[00:59:37.720 --> 00:59:42.120]   Use Google Chrome, google.com to find this.
[00:59:42.120 --> 00:59:45.520]   It was apparent that it is an ad call from Google
[00:59:45.520 --> 00:59:48.200]   to try and get me to upgrade up to a business listing
[00:59:48.200 --> 00:59:49.120]   or something. - I've had that call.
[00:59:49.120 --> 00:59:51.360]   - And then I use Google Voice to block that number.
[00:59:51.360 --> 00:59:53.600]   So that's what I would call an end-to-end solution
[00:59:53.600 --> 00:59:55.080]   that scales across the enterprise.
[00:59:55.080 --> 00:59:56.480]   Thank you Google, I guess.
[00:59:56.480 --> 00:59:58.000]   - Well, I can Google with Google.
[00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:02.800]   Speaking of Google, Max, this is kind of weird.
[01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:06.000]   Maybe you have a thought about this, Harry.
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.240]   Google hired or bought a company called Slide,
[01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:09.960]   I think for $200 million.
[01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:12.640]   And they were very, very proud of the fact
[01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:14.880]   that they made the Slide Division kind of independent.
[01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:16.600]   And they came out with a bunch of programs,
[01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:19.360]   most recently Photovine, but pool party.
[01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:22.560]   A bunch of really interesting programs,
[01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:24.680]   except that they were all on iOS.
[01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:26.200]   Most of them used Facebook Connect,
[01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:29.440]   none of them used Google Zone tools.
[01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:32.280]   And shortly after Photovine, a super poke pets,
[01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:33.880]   that's one you probably use all the time.
[01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:35.480]   - Oh, I'm forever poking my pets.
[01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:37.320]   - Yeah, disco, remember that one?
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:40.240]   The Facebook thing, the poking pets?
[01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:42.160]   - I think Dwight hung out right on that line.
[01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:43.880]   (laughing)
[01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:46.200]   - So no pet jokes.
[01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:48.240]   We'll get Dwight back.
[01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:50.440]   I don't want to know.
[01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:51.280]   - Can you help me understand, Leo?
[01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:52.600]   You use that to poke somebody else's pet.
[01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:54.040]   Is that the notion?
[01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:55.440]   Does your pet help you with that?
[01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:58.560]   - Harry, did you ever play with super poke pets?
[01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:00.800]   - I haven't used any of these apps as far as I can remember.
[01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:03.720]   - I actually downloaded pool party,
[01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:08.080]   which, you know, it was good because they call it PP.
[01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:09.600]   - Sure, pocket pool.
[01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:12.960]   - So pool party was a way to share photos.
[01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:15.040]   And I liked it.
[01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:17.960]   Although it was a little weird to PP somebody
[01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:19.000]   in the pool party.
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:23.640]   It's just an odd thing.
[01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:25.840]   They bought this company, Max Levchin,
[01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:29.600]   who was really probably the guy they wanted to hire,
[01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:32.320]   is gone, he's leaving Google.
[01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:34.160]   And they shut down slide and, you know,
[01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:35.640]   they allowed them to do Photovine,
[01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:36.680]   which came out last week.
[01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:38.360]   Even that is going to be shut down.
[01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:39.200]   - Yeah, we could go.
[01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:40.400]   We were all excited about Photovine
[01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:42.680]   and wondering when we could get on Photovine.
[01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:43.920]   - It's over already.
[01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:47.240]   - Plan a photo, watch it grow.
[01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:49.160]   Photovine, this is more photo sharing.
[01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:51.760]   So slide is was actually a pretty neat product,
[01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:52.800]   pretty neat company.
[01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:54.520]   - Yeah, the original stuff they did was cool.
[01:01:54.520 --> 01:01:56.960]   - Did Google completely bundle this?
[01:01:56.960 --> 01:01:57.800]   What happened?
[01:01:57.800 --> 01:01:58.640]   - And just struck me.
[01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:03.240]   This is the same month that HP shuts down.
[01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:04.080]   - Web OS?
[01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:06.000]   - It's a pad which has spent $1.2 billion
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.240]   for a year ago.
[01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:09.520]   I just, it staggers me that these companies
[01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:11.800]   have enough money that they can burn through it like that.
[01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:13.240]   - I think there's something, somebody was saying this
[01:02:13.240 --> 01:02:16.720]   this week on one of our shows that this is kind of a really,
[01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:21.000]   an indicator of the new economy in technology and startups.
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.560]   Maybe, I know Merlin, you're a big startup.
[01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:27.160]   You know, a lot of these guys, but that you got to have
[01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:28.280]   it hit right away or you go.
[01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:29.360]   It's like the movie industry.
[01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:32.360]   If you don't break, if you don't have a big first weekend,
[01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:35.760]   the smartest thing to do is cut bait and say goodbye.
[01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:37.920]   - Yeah, somebody really smart said something recently.
[01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:40.480]   I wanted to say it was Horace did you on a Simco,
[01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:42.320]   but I don't remember, but somebody said,
[01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:43.880]   and forgive me, chat room, you can,
[01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:45.400]   the Jackals can look it up.
[01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:47.640]   The, you, when you buy a company,
[01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:49.120]   you can buy it for one of three things.
[01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:50.320]   You can buy it for resources.
[01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:51.200]   You can buy it for talent.
[01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:53.080]   You can buy it for like market share.
[01:02:53.080 --> 01:02:54.880]   But even that you have to pay a price
[01:02:54.880 --> 01:02:55.920]   that covers all three of those,
[01:02:55.920 --> 01:02:57.160]   but you can only really do one of those.
[01:02:57.160 --> 01:02:58.000]   - You only get one.
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:02:59.640]   - Yeah, and so I think one of the problems is,
[01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:02.280]   and this is even setting aside the kind of cultural clashes
[01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:04.720]   that you see, I mean AOL time Warner,
[01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:07.160]   how great did that go in terms of culture.
[01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:08.000]   It happens all the time.
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.240]   It's so hard to do that position.
[01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:13.920]   And so, yeah, yeah.
[01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:15.120]   - I'm just showing this little video,
[01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:16.920]   Photovine of people, I don't know what.
[01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:20.360]   This is the same artist who does the Virgin America.
[01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:21.200]   - I can totally tell.
[01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:22.520]   - You know why it's the pointy movies.
[01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:23.360]   - Love the none.
[01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:24.200]   - Yeah.
[01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:25.040]   - Love the none.
[01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:26.360]   - The none with the router with the list system.
[01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:27.840]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:29.080]   - And let me hear the voice,
[01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:30.400]   'cause I think it's the same guy.
[01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:31.760]   - Sharing has become.
[01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:34.200]   - Well, what if you could easily share photos
[01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:35.400]   and keep the personal connection?
[01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:36.960]   - No, but it's a similar guy.
[01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:38.880]   - Introducing Photovine.
[01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:40.280]   A Photovine is a collection.
[01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:42.240]   - I've seen that video a dozen times.
[01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:44.680]   - That's not gonna get excited because it's over.
[01:03:44.680 --> 01:03:48.720]   So the idea being that if you can't,
[01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:51.880]   so obviously Google got a couple of hundred slide engineers,
[01:03:51.880 --> 01:03:52.720]   that's what they got.
[01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:53.560]   They got the talent.
[01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:54.880]   - I think most acquisitions--
[01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:55.720]   - It's talent.
[01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:56.560]   - He said talking about it,
[01:03:56.560 --> 01:03:57.880]   but I think most are involved talent.
[01:03:57.880 --> 01:03:59.120]   I mean, and you can see this at Google,
[01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:02.240]   my heuristic for Google used to be that if it doesn't make it
[01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:03.960]   into single sign-on within the first year,
[01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:04.800]   you're never gonna see it again.
[01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:06.200]   - And they still don't.
[01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:07.040]   - Well, yeah, and I mean,
[01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:10.040]   that's some talented people who, yeah.
[01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:11.280]   - Google has been really explicit
[01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:13.080]   that it's gonna get rid of a lot of stuff.
[01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:14.360]   They wanna do fewer things.
[01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:15.360]   - This is Larry Page, you think?
[01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:16.200]   - Yeah.
[01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:18.040]   - They wanna put more wood behind the arrow,
[01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:19.800]   and so they're killing stuff right and left,
[01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:21.960]   which is probably ultimately is a good idea.
[01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:23.080]   - I like that phrase.
[01:04:23.080 --> 01:04:23.920]   - I'm gonna be using that.
[01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:26.080]   - I wanna put more wood behind my hair.
[01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:27.080]   - I think it's somebody else in my house.
[01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:28.680]   - That's where I go to those Canadian pharmacies.
[01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:31.080]   - Yes, yes.
[01:04:31.080 --> 01:04:32.560]   - They killed Google--
[01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:33.560]   - Gary's just going to,
[01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:35.640]   full speed, go ahead, just ignore his hair.
[01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:38.120]   - They killed Google News timeline,
[01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:40.160]   which was a service I just loved and used all the time.
[01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:41.560]   - I love that too, they killed it.
[01:04:41.560 --> 01:04:43.040]   - They just killed sets, which sucks.
[01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:44.040]   Sets was awesome.
[01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:44.880]   - What sets?
[01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:45.720]   - Google sets, you could kill it.
[01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:48.000]   - They're killing stuff before I even know about it.
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.880]   - I'm sorry, I don't have to hear.
[01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:50.720]   - Now the web's not--
[01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:53.200]   - I'm sort of faker way through replicating Google News
[01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:55.080]   timeline with Google News if you know what to do,
[01:04:55.080 --> 01:04:56.880]   but they killed that, and I'm sorry.
[01:04:56.880 --> 01:04:59.520]   That was something Andy Hertzfeld wrote from the UI on--
[01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:00.360]   - No, that's too bad.
[01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:03.240]   - Before he moved over to Google+,
[01:05:03.240 --> 01:05:05.560]   - Well, I guess you cannot fault a company.
[01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:09.240]   Even a company like HP, somebody said,
[01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:13.000]   "We now know the HP touchpad was not a failure."
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:14.800]   The price was the failure.
[01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:15.640]   - Well--
[01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:17.280]   - Because they're selling it out at 99 bucks.
[01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:19.200]   - No, I don't think so.
[01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:20.760]   - It makes two.
[01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:22.200]   - Well, that will do well.
[01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:24.960]   - Bear with me here, what if you did sell it at 99 bucks,
[01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:27.400]   and you, I mean, Google's shown that,
[01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:29.280]   in the Firefox is shown in the browser,
[01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:31.840]   you can make lots of money by Google searches in the browser.
[01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:34.960]   What if you did subsidize it to buy market share?
[01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:36.720]   Look at, they already lost that money.
[01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:38.960]   Maybe they should have lost the money upfront.
[01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:41.240]   Subsidized market share, get developers going,
[01:05:41.240 --> 01:05:42.360]   get people excited about it.
[01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:46.920]   You think, Harry, Dwight, you sound skeptical, you don't.
[01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:51.760]   - No, I think that HP and Leo Apotheca
[01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:54.080]   have a completely different direction for that company.
[01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:55.760]   I think they wanna go enterprise,
[01:05:55.760 --> 01:06:00.760]   and I saw a description of the HP touchpad
[01:06:00.760 --> 01:06:05.000]   as being similar to the Newton for Apple,
[01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.320]   is that when, you know, soon as Steve Jobs came back,
[01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:08.320]   he killed it.
[01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:09.160]   - Right.
[01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:12.080]   - And as soon as Leo Apotheca had the opportunity,
[01:06:12.080 --> 01:06:14.640]   he killed something that Mark Heard had, you know,
[01:06:14.640 --> 01:06:15.480]   essentially--
[01:06:15.480 --> 01:06:16.880]   - It was a Mark Heard, it was a Mark Heard.
[01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:19.480]   - Right, right, and I just think that he was looking
[01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:22.560]   for any excuse and when it didn't sell out immediately.
[01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:25.840]   But see, if you sell anything of that complexity,
[01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:27.840]   any type of gadget like that,
[01:06:27.840 --> 01:06:29.520]   and you have a limited amount of them,
[01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:32.440]   and you sell it for 99 bucks, every nerd who wants to hack it
[01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:34.840]   is gonna go buy it, and that's what happened.
[01:06:34.840 --> 01:06:36.560]   And I don't think you can look at that and say,
[01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:38.680]   okay, that's the price tablets have to be.
[01:06:38.680 --> 01:06:42.880]   - No, I don't think they have to be 99 bucks for sure.
[01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:45.120]   - Right, but I think that, you know,
[01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:46.640]   - Apple is showing that they could pretty well
[01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:48.320]   at 500 bucks.
[01:06:48.320 --> 01:06:51.080]   - Harry's piece about Amazon, which was,
[01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:53.040]   I really liked, it was really simply written,
[01:06:53.040 --> 01:06:54.440]   and he walked through kind of, okay,
[01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:56.120]   what if this price, what is this price?
[01:06:56.120 --> 01:06:59.000]   Is a good exercise at kind of looking at what a real,
[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:00.640]   you know, what tablets will cost.
[01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:05.080]   The iPad is actually a pretty cheap piece of technology
[01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:06.800]   in terms of cost.
[01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:09.760]   We all expected it to be 900 bucks when it came out, right?
[01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:10.600]   - Right.
[01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:13.840]   - And it's $4.99, but I think we're about to see
[01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:18.120]   the quote, Apple Tax be applied to the iPad
[01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:21.120]   because once the Amazon tablet comes out,
[01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:23.240]   I think that's gonna set a new bar for pricing.
[01:07:23.240 --> 01:07:25.120]   - Let's talk, really, that was a great article here.
[01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:27.560]   Let's talk about Amazon.
[01:07:27.560 --> 01:07:29.240]   It's gonna, any day now,
[01:07:29.240 --> 01:07:30.760]   we're gonna start seeing those Amazon tablets.
[01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:32.920]   Let's talk about that in just a second.
[01:07:32.920 --> 01:07:33.760]   What a great panel.
[01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:35.520]   I'm so, Merlin Mann, it's great to have you.
[01:07:35.520 --> 01:07:36.680]   Thank you for the coffee.
[01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:39.200]   Plug for Heart, Hearth, Earth.
[01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:43.120]   This is Brown Owl Coffee on 22nd in Tera Val in San Francisco.
[01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:45.120]   The best coffee place in the world, right?
[01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:45.960]   - That is right.
[01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:48.520]   - Yeah, my friends, James and Ariana,
[01:07:48.520 --> 01:07:49.360]   they make great coffee.
[01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:50.600]   - It smells good.
[01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:52.120]   Before the show, just so you know, folks,
[01:07:52.120 --> 01:07:54.200]   we were eating these beans right out of the bag.
[01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:55.040]   - Slam them.
[01:07:55.040 --> 01:07:55.880]   - They're that good.
[01:07:55.880 --> 01:07:56.720]   - I still have one to go.
[01:07:56.720 --> 01:07:58.800]   (laughing)
[01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:00.960]   - You brought me a bag of coffee
[01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:02.840]   called Snake Bite Espresso.
[01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:04.000]   - Boom.
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:04.840]   - Boom, yeah.
[01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:06.760]   - They do it themselves, 819, they just made this fresh.
[01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:07.600]   - It was fresh.
[01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:08.440]   - Fresh.
[01:08:08.440 --> 01:08:10.680]   - It's only, well, that's kind of nine days old, actually.
[01:08:10.680 --> 01:08:12.400]   - Well, it's a truly--
[01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:13.240]   - Not fresh.
[01:08:13.240 --> 01:08:15.040]   (laughing)
[01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:17.640]   - Thank you, that was very nice of you.
[01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:21.000]   Also with is Harry McCracken of the Technologizer blog,
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.360]   which is a must read, really great analysis.
[01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:27.400]   Harry, many years editor in chief PC World, right?
[01:08:27.400 --> 01:08:28.240]   - Yes.
[01:08:28.240 --> 01:08:29.080]   - I got the magazine right.
[01:08:29.080 --> 01:08:31.040]   - I've worked for 13 years and I should give a plug
[01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:33.840]   to time.com too, 'cause I write a weekly column
[01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:34.680]   for time as well.
[01:08:34.680 --> 01:08:35.520]   - Oh, that's good.
[01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:36.680]   When did you start doing that?
[01:08:36.680 --> 01:08:37.520]   - About a year ago.
[01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:38.360]   - Oh, that's great.
[01:08:38.360 --> 01:08:39.640]   - It's also called Technologizer.
[01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:40.960]   - Very nice, time.
[01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:43.280]   Is that only on the time.com site?
[01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:45.760]   It's on the website and I write for the magazine
[01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:46.600]   pretty frequently.
[01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:47.440]   - I have seen your byline in the magazine.
[01:08:47.440 --> 01:08:48.360]   - Not every week, but some weeks.
[01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:49.200]   - Okay, good.
[01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:53.440]   And of course, Mr. Tech Blog himself,
[01:08:53.440 --> 01:08:55.840]   Dwight Silverman from the Houston Chronicle.
[01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:58.080]   He's our token newspaper man.
[01:08:58.080 --> 01:09:00.340]   (laughing)
[01:09:00.340 --> 01:09:03.880]   - I should be sure a fedora with a piece of paper in it
[01:09:03.880 --> 01:09:05.480]   that says press.
[01:09:05.480 --> 01:09:07.280]   - I should wear that red hat, you know?
[01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:09.200]   - Yeah, the red hat, red hat.
[01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:10.720]   - That's right.
[01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:13.080]   - Brought to you today, of course, by audible.com.
[01:09:13.080 --> 01:09:14.800]   I live for audible books.
[01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:16.360]   I listen to audible books all the time.
[01:09:16.360 --> 01:09:17.960]   I'm listening to two right now.
[01:09:17.960 --> 01:09:20.920]   Stennis Love's Lem's Solaris,
[01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:22.080]   they did a new translation.
[01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:24.120]   Audible, it should get a lot of credit for this.
[01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:26.960]   Because it was a crappy translation of the original Polish
[01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:29.160]   that's been in print for years.
[01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:30.520]   Audible said there's a better way.
[01:09:30.520 --> 01:09:32.480]   Lem even didn't ever like that translation.
[01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:36.480]   They commissioned a new translation
[01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:38.920]   of this classic science fiction book
[01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:42.480]   and also produced it as part of their Audible Frontiers
[01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:43.320]   program.
[01:09:43.320 --> 01:09:45.880]   I really want to give them a plug,
[01:09:45.880 --> 01:09:48.320]   because Audible Frontiers, if you're a science fiction fan,
[01:09:48.320 --> 01:09:51.160]   is saving science fiction books,
[01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:53.560]   recording them often for the first time ever,
[01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:56.640]   classics, and what a great way to listen.
[01:09:56.640 --> 01:09:58.480]   I think science fiction particularly makes good audible
[01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:01.120]   books because it's kind of, they come alive.
[01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:02.800]   You really are seeing it.
[01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:04.880]   I wasn't really crazy about the George Clooney movie.
[01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:06.160]   It was a little, it was a little slow.
[01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:07.000]   - What about the other one?
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:07.840]   I started watching the other one.
[01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:08.680]   - I haven't seen the Polish one.
[01:10:08.680 --> 01:10:09.520]   - I'm not great.
[01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:10.360]   - I'm not gonna watch that.
[01:10:10.360 --> 01:10:11.200]   - I'm gonna watch that.
[01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:12.200]   - Is it on the streaming?
[01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:13.040]   - Yeah, I fell asleep.
[01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:13.880]   That was great.
[01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:14.720]   - I fell asleep dreaming.
[01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:15.880]   - Don't like you don't.
[01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:17.720]   (laughing)
[01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:18.960]   You will not fall asleep during the book.
[01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:21.640]   It's really, really good.
[01:10:21.640 --> 01:10:24.240]   So, a little credit do there.
[01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:27.760]   I'm also listening to this, a book that was recommended
[01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:30.440]   by Andy Anaco, the latest,
[01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:35.320]   it's about the Americans going to Paris in the 1830s.
[01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:37.200]   The Greater Journey.
[01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:38.520]   Oh, is that a good book?
[01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:41.440]   I really enjoyed this,
[01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:43.200]   but I wanna show you since we,
[01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:45.000]   Americans Paris, David McCullough's latest,
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:46.680]   he narrates the first chapter.
[01:10:46.680 --> 01:10:48.120]   And when you hear David McCullough reading,
[01:10:48.120 --> 01:10:51.920]   it's like, why don't all narrators sound this?
[01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:54.560]   I mean, you can just follow it so beautifully.
[01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:55.400]   I love his voice.
[01:10:55.400 --> 01:10:56.960]   - I would do my email more if you would read it to me.
[01:10:56.960 --> 01:10:57.800]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:10:57.800 --> 01:10:58.640]   - He's such a great,
[01:10:58.640 --> 01:11:02.040]   - And then Merlin Manzie male came in from,
[01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:05.600]   but I wanted to recommend a book,
[01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:07.200]   given that we were just talking about David Allen.
[01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:09.200]   He's gonna be on triangulation Wednesday
[01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:10.440]   to talk about getting things done.
[01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:13.680]   This is a chance for you to quickly get getting things done.
[01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:16.640]   And you know what, what a great way to listen to this book,
[01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:18.240]   'cause David himself narrates it.
[01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:19.680]   And it's really like going to the seminar.
[01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:20.520]   - I have listened to it.
[01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:21.840]   - Yeah, it's fantastic.
[01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:23.280]   So I just gave you three books.
[01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:24.120]   Now here's the deal.

[01:11:58.240 --> 01:12:01.280]   with his new translation, it's mind-bogglingly good.
[01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:02.920]   The Greater Journey by David McCullough.
[01:12:02.920 --> 01:12:06.160]   Again, another great book, if you like history,
[01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:08.400]   science fiction history, and then business,
[01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:10.560]   getting things done, the art of stress free productivity.
[01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:12.360]   You see, this is what I love about Audible.
[01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:15.000]   I flip around, I just did a nonfiction book,
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:16.000]   so I'm doing a fiction book,
[01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:16.960]   and then I'm gonna do a nonfiction,
[01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:18.560]   I just love doing that.
[01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:20.760]   Give 'em a try, they play back on everything,
[01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:22.120]   including if you've got a new Kindle,
[01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:25.800]   you'll see in addition to your Amazon books on the Kindle,
[01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:27.880]   you'll see your Audible audio books,

[01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:42.560]   we thank them for their support of this week in tech.
[01:12:42.560 --> 01:12:44.400]   So, Harry, you must know,
[01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:46.320]   when are we gonna see an Amazon tablet?
[01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:48.120]   - Well, I mean, you gotta think it's very shortly,
[01:12:48.120 --> 01:12:50.440]   because they want it to be up and running in the holidays.
[01:12:50.440 --> 01:12:51.280]   - Christmas, yeah.
[01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:52.800]   - I'd say well before then, I'm guessing.
[01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:55.360]   - So you think in next month, maybe October, the latest?
[01:12:55.360 --> 01:12:56.200]   - It seems logical.
[01:12:56.200 --> 01:12:57.040]   - Yeah. - I mean,
[01:12:57.040 --> 01:12:59.080]   all the rumors seem to point that direction.
[01:12:59.080 --> 01:13:01.080]   The rumors are that it is gonna be,
[01:13:01.080 --> 01:13:02.760]   I think the New York Post, that it's gonna be hundreds,
[01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:04.720]   less on the iPad,
[01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:06.960]   and an Amazon is one of the few companies
[01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:09.000]   that could plausibly kind of subsidize the hardware,
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:12.240]   because they've got the music, they've got the movies,
[01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:15.360]   they've got the books, they've got apps,
[01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:19.200]   and my guess is maybe $2.99, $1.99.
[01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:20.840]   - Wow. - Wouldn't seem to involve
[01:13:20.840 --> 01:13:21.760]   a lot of a subsidy.
[01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:23.800]   - They're practically given the Kindle away at this point.
[01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:25.640]   It's 113 bucks with ads.
[01:13:25.640 --> 01:13:26.480]   - Yeah.
[01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:27.640]   - I mean, it's really, that's at the point
[01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:28.720]   where it's just almost--
[01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:30.840]   - So the tablet's gonna be more expensive than the Kindle,
[01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:33.680]   but Amazon, unlike everybody else,
[01:13:33.680 --> 01:13:35.720]   might be willing to subsidize that.
[01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:38.160]   Apple, by the way, probably could subsidize the iPad,
[01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:39.120]   but it doesn't want to,
[01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:40.840]   'cause it can easily sell them at $4.99,
[01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:41.680]   and then make-- - They don't have to.
[01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:44.220]   - Make even more money as people buy stuff.
[01:13:44.220 --> 01:13:48.200]   - Would they use it like Amazon tablet
[01:13:48.200 --> 01:13:50.160]   have the store on it?
[01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:51.880]   Could you just, 'cause I mean, I can't really see--
[01:13:51.880 --> 01:13:52.720]   - Of course they would. - I can't deal with it.
[01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:54.080]   - Yeah, I just mean, if you're--
[01:13:54.080 --> 01:13:56.000]   - The Kindle was. - If you're an Amazon prime nerd,
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:57.080]   you could go in and just say,
[01:13:57.080 --> 01:13:58.440]   "I want these dish towels tomorrow."
[01:13:58.440 --> 01:14:00.040]   Would you think the whole store would be there?
[01:14:00.040 --> 01:14:01.480]   - I do that already all the time.
[01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:02.520]   - But that would be kind of a no-brainer
[01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:03.360]   to put all that on there.
[01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:05.680]   - So that's why they can give this away.
[01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:06.840]   - Turn the wire into your account.
[01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:08.360]   - Hardware button for wish list, I mean.
[01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:09.200]   - Yeah.
[01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:11.400]   And it'll be Android, yeah?
[01:14:11.400 --> 01:14:13.200]   - It's Android, I think we know that for sure.
[01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:15.840]   It's supposedly as not super thin or super light,
[01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:19.120]   it's maybe not focused so much on the telecoms.
[01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:21.000]   - The industrial design on the Kindle
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.720]   is about as piss-poor as you could get.
[01:14:23.720 --> 01:14:25.880]   And it's still great, right?
[01:14:25.880 --> 01:14:26.920]   Am I wrong?
[01:14:26.920 --> 01:14:27.800]   The new Kindle?
[01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:30.240]   The new Kindle is a nice-- - No, it still isn't.
[01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:32.760]   - Well, okay, it's cheap, plasticky,
[01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:35.760]   unusable keyboard.
[01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:37.160]   - I think it's titanium.
[01:14:37.160 --> 01:14:38.440]   I think the new one is titanium.
[01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:41.440]   - Oh, the new, I don't have a titanium Kindle.
[01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:42.280]   What are you talking about?
[01:14:42.280 --> 01:14:43.120]   - What do you talk about?
[01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:43.960]   - The new one, the titanium Kindle?
[01:14:43.960 --> 01:14:45.160]   - The brown one. - How about that?
[01:14:45.160 --> 01:14:47.520]   - The brown one, I think, is metal.
[01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:48.520]   - Oh, I'm gonna buy that.
[01:14:48.520 --> 01:14:49.360]   - That's a brown Kindle.
[01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:50.880]   (laughing)
[01:14:50.880 --> 01:14:51.720]   - It's just-- - It's gun metal.
[01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:53.280]   - Don't use the brown Kindle.
[01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:54.800]   Wait a minute, what are you talking about?
[01:14:54.800 --> 01:14:56.680]   I don't know what you're smoking.
[01:14:56.680 --> 01:14:58.800]   There's no titanium Kindle.
[01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:00.040]   - Yeah, I think that's titanium.
[01:15:00.040 --> 01:15:01.600]   - No, it's not.
[01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:02.440]   What is it?
[01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:03.720]   It's plastic, it's cheap.
[01:15:03.720 --> 01:15:04.720]   - Hold on, I got one.
[01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:06.280]   - All right, look, instant order update.
[01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:07.560]   You purchased this item.
[01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:10.200]   It's cheap plastic.
[01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:13.080]   Carbon fiber.
[01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:15.360]   Are you, I don't know what you're talking about.
[01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:17.360]   And he's gonna go get, this is how often he's handled.
[01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:18.520]   He's Kindle, he's off.
[01:15:18.520 --> 01:15:22.120]   Take a shot of Dwight.
[01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:23.840]   He's disappeared.
[01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:26.000]   He's an empty chair there.
[01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:27.800]   Did I, was I too harsh?
[01:15:27.800 --> 01:15:28.640]   - You're a little harsh.
[01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:29.920]   - He's trying to get us titanium Kindle.
[01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:32.640]   - Yeah, right, I'm still looking for it too.
[01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:35.000]   - That is not titanium, that's plastic.
[01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:38.040]   - Let's see what--
[01:15:38.040 --> 01:15:39.040]   - Okay, well yeah, that's plastic.
[01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:41.800]   (laughing)
[01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:43.880]   - Wow, this is Kindle's titanium.
[01:15:43.880 --> 01:15:46.760]   - Yeah, no, it's--
[01:15:46.760 --> 01:15:50.360]   - But I'm just saying, it's great.
[01:15:50.360 --> 01:15:51.960]   I love it, I'm not complaining about it.
[01:15:51.960 --> 01:15:54.160]   I'm just saying the industrial design is irrelevant
[01:15:54.160 --> 01:15:55.400]   if you've got a product that could.
[01:15:55.400 --> 01:15:56.680]   - Amazon is not about hardware.
[01:15:56.680 --> 01:15:58.520]   Amazon is about software and services.
[01:15:58.520 --> 01:16:00.240]   And those, they do really well.
[01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:01.680]   - Right.
[01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:03.480]   It's made of adamantium.
[01:16:03.480 --> 01:16:05.240]   - So do you think--
[01:16:05.240 --> 01:16:07.800]   So Harry, do you think it'll be called the Kindle?
[01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:09.880]   Do you think they'll keep that name?
[01:16:09.880 --> 01:16:11.840]   - I mean, up until now they've always said
[01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:13.920]   that Kindle is a brand that's only about reading.
[01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:16.560]   My guess is it'll be called something else,
[01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:19.120]   but there will be a Kindle store and a Kindle app on it.
[01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:20.320]   - It's such a good brand.
[01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:24.200]   - Kind of like how the iPhone had the iPod on it.
[01:16:24.200 --> 01:16:26.640]   - That's interesting, so make it,
[01:16:26.640 --> 01:16:28.920]   because they do, I think that they probably do very well
[01:16:28.920 --> 01:16:30.160]   with their Kindle apps.
[01:16:30.160 --> 01:16:34.920]   And now this read.amazon.com, this HTML5 Kindle,
[01:16:34.920 --> 01:16:36.640]   that they probably do wanna keep that brand
[01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:37.640]   'cause it's such a good brand.
[01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:39.640]   - I think so, and I think for years to come
[01:16:39.640 --> 01:16:41.760]   there will be people who'll want something that's that cheap
[01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:44.400]   and that's small and that reading focused.
[01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:47.200]   - The thing I love the best about this tablet
[01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:48.480]   is actually not the tablet,
[01:16:48.480 --> 01:16:52.600]   but it's this case that they sell to go with it
[01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:57.600]   that has a lamp light that pulls up and lights up.
[01:16:57.600 --> 01:16:59.760]   - Where can I get this over there?
[01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:02.080]   - There we go, and it has a little light on the end of it.
[01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:06.120]   So when you read at night, you don't bother your partner.
[01:17:06.120 --> 01:17:07.880]   - That really puts wood behind my era.
[01:17:07.880 --> 01:17:11.760]   You're not, well.
[01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:13.360]   - You know, you call it a tablet,
[01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:15.360]   but I'm just thinking, like if you made a thing
[01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:16.800]   that yeah, you could read on, yeah,
[01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:18.840]   maybe you could put some MP3s and listen to music on.
[01:17:18.840 --> 01:17:22.120]   But if you put the Amazon store,
[01:17:22.120 --> 01:17:23.880]   Facebook, email, and Twitter on there,
[01:17:23.880 --> 01:17:26.080]   I think tons of people would buy that.
[01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:27.200]   I don't know if you call that a tablet,
[01:17:27.200 --> 01:17:28.040]   but you know what I'm saying?
[01:17:28.040 --> 01:17:29.720]   For most people, what do most people do
[01:17:29.720 --> 01:17:31.880]   with their computer or with their iPhone
[01:17:31.880 --> 01:17:32.720]   or with their whatever?
[01:17:32.720 --> 01:17:34.320]   If you were to put the, and then like Andy said--
[01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:35.600]   - You need a browser or email?
[01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:36.760]   - Here's the thing, like Andy said,
[01:17:36.760 --> 01:17:39.080]   with remember when Andy, when the Kindle first came out,
[01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:40.320]   he made that great remark of saying,
[01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:41.760]   "Well, depending on what you do,
[01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:44.960]   "the best thing for you might be a lifetime of free 3G,
[01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:45.800]   "depending on what you use."
[01:17:45.800 --> 01:17:46.920]   The problem is right now that browser,
[01:17:46.920 --> 01:17:49.600]   that experimental browser is no fun to use,
[01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:51.680]   but if you tune those hardware buttons,
[01:17:51.680 --> 01:17:52.880]   this might be a little ambitious for Amazon,
[01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:54.400]   but I'm just saying, like if you have a store,
[01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:56.760]   Facebook, Twitter, email browser on there,
[01:17:56.760 --> 01:17:58.720]   basic syncing, I think that,
[01:17:58.720 --> 01:18:00.360]   I could see people buying that.
[01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:01.640]   - It's almost the computer of the future.
[01:18:01.640 --> 01:18:03.400]   - I think jinnying up a Kindle and calling it a tablet,
[01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:05.600]   I don't know about that, but like if I had the store on it,
[01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:06.880]   like wouldn't you, I think that'd be awesome.
[01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:08.320]   - Of course it'll have the store on it.
[01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:09.160]   - Oh yeah.
[01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:10.240]   - The whole Amazon store.
[01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:11.400]   - The whole thing, yeah.
[01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:13.920]   - I just thought there was every phone, every time.
[01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:15.440]   I mean that's everywhere, right?
[01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:18.600]   - Right, and that's easy as on your iPhone.
[01:18:18.600 --> 01:18:19.920]   It's easy with one click.
[01:18:19.920 --> 01:18:21.080]   - No, that's death.
[01:18:21.080 --> 01:18:21.920]   - That's death.
[01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:23.080]   - I do, but I have to--
[01:18:23.080 --> 01:18:25.080]   - My wife will see my book and I have it before
[01:18:25.080 --> 01:18:27.040]   we've left the restaurant.
[01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:28.600]   - All right.
[01:18:28.600 --> 01:18:30.360]   - And by the way, death not just for me,
[01:18:30.360 --> 01:18:33.080]   but also for any bookstore with any,
[01:18:33.080 --> 01:18:36.400]   what copper feels, it's got to just be dying
[01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:39.040]   because I don't go down the street to this great bookstore.
[01:18:39.040 --> 01:18:40.040]   We have in Petaluma, I just go,
[01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:42.280]   "Yeah honey, I'll get it for you, I'll be here tomorrow."
[01:18:42.280 --> 01:18:44.380]   (laughs)
[01:18:44.380 --> 01:18:47.800]   - Will it be, will it be, Harry,
[01:18:47.800 --> 01:18:52.120]   will it be hardware power wise,
[01:18:52.120 --> 01:18:56.520]   comparable to say the iPad or the other Android tablets,
[01:18:56.520 --> 01:18:59.080]   or will it be a very kind of low and slow?
[01:18:59.080 --> 01:19:00.000]   It won't be E-ink, right?
[01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:00.960]   It'll be color.
[01:19:00.960 --> 01:19:02.600]   - Color, I'm sure, so they can't move these.
[01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:04.880]   I mean the rumor is that it's not gonna be that exciting
[01:19:04.880 --> 01:19:07.560]   if you care about specs, but on the other hand,
[01:19:07.560 --> 01:19:08.600]   there are all these tablets out there
[01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:10.600]   that have fantastic specs, they're nowhere in ours.
[01:19:10.600 --> 01:19:11.920]   'Cause it's the iPad, so.
[01:19:11.920 --> 01:19:13.600]   - If it can play, so movies is key.
[01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:15.960]   If it can play movie, it's kind of good enough to play movies.
[01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:17.280]   - Just have good video playback.
[01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:21.560]   - I mean, maybe it's not super 10 finger multi-touch
[01:19:21.560 --> 01:19:22.840]   in the way that the iPad is,
[01:19:22.840 --> 01:19:24.600]   and I can see something still having
[01:19:24.600 --> 01:19:26.160]   a new experience without that.
[01:19:26.160 --> 01:19:27.000]   - Doesn't need that.
[01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:28.280]   - We know that there are tons of people out there
[01:19:28.280 --> 01:19:30.920]   who'll never spend $500 for an iPad.
[01:19:30.920 --> 01:19:32.280]   So I think there is a market out there
[01:19:32.280 --> 01:19:35.120]   for something that's simple and well done,
[01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:36.680]   and a couple of hundred dollars cheaper.
[01:19:36.680 --> 01:19:38.920]   - Are people scared to, I mean Apple,
[01:19:38.920 --> 01:19:42.120]   and what's left of the Android tablet makers
[01:19:42.120 --> 01:19:44.160]   scared to death, they must be?
[01:19:44.160 --> 01:19:45.040]   Maybe not Apple.
[01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.560]   - Apple must, in some ways Apple may welcome this
[01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:51.640]   as a differentiator.
[01:19:51.640 --> 01:19:54.520]   The iPad is the, if you want something that's really great
[01:19:54.520 --> 01:19:57.360]   and works well and is beautifully designed, get that.
[01:19:57.360 --> 01:20:00.720]   This is the net book to Apple's MacBook Air.
[01:20:00.720 --> 01:20:02.720]   - I think it's probably gonna be yours before Apple
[01:20:02.720 --> 01:20:03.800]   has any reason to be scared.
[01:20:03.800 --> 01:20:04.640]   - Yeah, anybody.
[01:20:04.640 --> 01:20:06.000]   - Right.
[01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.960]   Harry, in your piece, you kind of walk
[01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:11.280]   through the different pricing and you talk about,
[01:20:11.280 --> 01:20:14.120]   they wouldn't take it down to a certain level
[01:20:14.120 --> 01:20:16.080]   because that takes it below a Kindle.
[01:20:16.080 --> 01:20:17.960]   But with this, and then Leo mentioned,
[01:20:17.960 --> 01:20:19.760]   they're almost giving the Kindle away,
[01:20:19.760 --> 01:20:23.200]   would this tablet maybe be the excuse that Amazon
[01:20:23.200 --> 01:20:25.560]   would need to give the Kindle away?
[01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:27.720]   So it can price us at, say, $149?
[01:20:27.720 --> 01:20:30.120]   - People always say that that's the next logical thing
[01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:32.120]   for Amazon to do, and I assume there will be
[01:20:32.120 --> 01:20:34.720]   another Kindle for the holidays as well.
[01:20:34.720 --> 01:20:37.240]   And it would be awfully fun if it was a free Kindle,
[01:20:37.240 --> 01:20:38.680]   and I'm still a little bit skeptical about that.
[01:20:38.680 --> 01:20:39.760]   - They're so close.
[01:20:39.760 --> 01:20:41.000]   - But they're getting in there.
[01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:44.080]   - It's interesting because you only get like 25 bucks off,
[01:20:44.080 --> 01:20:45.680]   for the ads they have on there.
[01:20:45.680 --> 01:20:48.320]   There's very, I guess it's not very valuable
[01:20:48.320 --> 01:20:49.400]   to them to put ads on there.
[01:20:49.400 --> 01:20:51.760]   - I mean, the theory is maybe if you belong to Amazon Prime,
[01:20:51.760 --> 01:20:53.560]   which is what, is that $80?
[01:20:53.560 --> 01:20:54.920]   - Yeah, 75 bucks a year.
[01:20:54.920 --> 01:20:57.000]   - You join Prime and you get a free Kindle.
[01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.560]   - Prime is the best deal right now anywhere.
[01:20:59.560 --> 01:21:02.120]   - Did you see this a few, it was back in February,
[01:21:02.120 --> 01:21:06.240]   but somebody was graphing the line of what a Kindle is cost
[01:21:06.240 --> 01:21:07.640]   over time, I'm sure you saw this, Harry,
[01:21:07.640 --> 01:21:12.120]   and predicting based on the Kindle would be free.
[01:21:12.120 --> 01:21:13.360]   - It's a pretty steep slope.
[01:21:13.360 --> 01:21:14.240]   - Well, if you look at the line,
[01:21:14.240 --> 01:21:15.480]   I mean, it's a perfect straight line,
[01:21:15.480 --> 01:21:19.360]   but I realize that's nothing to bank on,
[01:21:19.360 --> 01:21:20.280]   but it's such an interesting idea.
[01:21:20.280 --> 01:21:22.800]   In the same way, I wouldn't charge a buck for iTunes.
[01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:24.600]   It's worth more than a buck to me,
[01:21:24.600 --> 01:21:25.920]   but I think it's worth a lot more to Apple
[01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:28.880]   to give it away and make it a platform for buying stuff.
[01:21:28.880 --> 01:21:30.760]   That's the thing is the Kindle, I mean,
[01:21:30.760 --> 01:21:32.480]   I mean, gosh, to even compare it to Apple,
[01:21:32.480 --> 01:21:33.720]   I know I'm the big fan player, whatever,
[01:21:33.720 --> 01:21:35.760]   but I think comparing those, that's, you know,
[01:21:35.760 --> 01:21:37.520]   I don't think Honda Accords are gonna sell less
[01:21:37.520 --> 01:21:39.200]   'cause somebody makes a cheaper skateboard.
[01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:40.880]   I mean, we're talking about different kinds of things.
[01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:43.280]   I see this being the pad that everybody's always wanted.
[01:21:43.280 --> 01:21:44.320]   - See? - Crashing.
[01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:45.160]   - Crashing.
[01:21:45.160 --> 01:21:46.400]   - It's my name. - You think it's my extensions?
[01:21:46.400 --> 01:21:47.240]   - Hey, yeah. - I don't know,
[01:21:47.240 --> 01:21:49.120]   could be your, excuse me?
[01:21:49.120 --> 01:21:49.960]   - What the hell's that?
[01:21:49.960 --> 01:21:51.400]   - Hold on, hold on.
[01:21:51.400 --> 01:21:52.360]   Oh, thank God, it's not in here.
[01:21:52.360 --> 01:21:54.240]   I thought that I had visions of the brick house
[01:21:54.240 --> 01:21:55.960]   burning down, oh my God.
[01:21:55.960 --> 01:21:56.800]   (audience laughing)
[01:21:56.800 --> 01:21:57.640]   The horror.
[01:21:57.640 --> 01:22:01.000]   You're really scared to be right there.
[01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:02.400]   Oh my God.
[01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:06.640]   My lovely wife is cooking and sadly,
[01:22:06.640 --> 01:22:09.800]   the builders of this house put a smoke detector
[01:22:09.800 --> 01:22:11.320]   right above the oven.
[01:22:11.320 --> 01:22:12.160]   - Why do they do that?
[01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:13.000]   - Oh, they do. - They always do.
[01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:14.680]   - Open the oven.
[01:22:14.680 --> 01:22:15.520]   The smoke detector.
[01:22:15.520 --> 01:22:16.680]   - But do you, how did you turn that off,
[01:22:16.680 --> 01:22:18.000]   so could you have a remote control?
[01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:18.840]   How did you do that?
[01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:20.280]   - No, no, I have, I have a mute.
[01:22:20.280 --> 01:22:21.680]   I just muted Skype.
[01:22:21.680 --> 01:22:22.520]   - Oh.
[01:22:22.520 --> 01:22:23.480]   - And so you didn't hear it.
[01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:25.400]   It was still going on, though.
[01:22:25.400 --> 01:22:27.960]   But my apologies and you're all welcome to come over
[01:22:27.960 --> 01:22:29.760]   for dinner 'cause it's gonna be good.
[01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:31.240]   - God, if I ever hear that sound in here,
[01:22:31.240 --> 01:22:32.280]   I'm just gonna die.
[01:22:32.280 --> 01:22:33.400]   I'm gonna die.
[01:22:33.400 --> 01:22:35.280]   So the results are in,
[01:22:35.280 --> 01:22:37.440]   you might remember that the eBay auction
[01:22:37.440 --> 01:22:40.600]   for the drawing of an HP touchpad.
[01:22:40.600 --> 01:22:43.000]   I don't mean a drawing for an HP touchpad.
[01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:46.960]   I mean a drawing of an HP touchpad,
[01:22:46.960 --> 01:22:51.880]   16 gigabytes, WiFi, 9.7 inches.
[01:22:51.880 --> 01:22:54.400]   Finally closed at $99,900.
[01:22:54.400 --> 01:22:55.880]   (laughs)
[01:22:55.880 --> 01:22:58.520]   Wow, you are the lucky, high bidder.
[01:22:58.520 --> 01:23:00.800]   - Does it come with a drawing of the case?
[01:23:00.800 --> 01:23:02.640]   - You know, I think the case is extra.
[01:23:02.640 --> 01:23:05.000]   It's a nice drawing, though.
[01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:05.840]   - Sure is.
[01:23:05.840 --> 01:23:06.680]   - I think some attention to detail
[01:23:06.680 --> 01:23:08.880]   has been put into the icons.
[01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:11.400]   - It's thin enough, it fits inside a Manila envelope.
[01:23:11.400 --> 01:23:14.640]   - It's probably got as much future as the touchpad.
[01:23:14.640 --> 01:23:17.320]   That's pretty funny.
[01:23:17.320 --> 01:23:18.160]   - Why?
[01:23:18.160 --> 01:23:20.000]   - This is obviously just a goof, yeah?
[01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:23.320]   - I think it might be a goof.
[01:23:23.320 --> 01:23:24.160]   - I don't know.
[01:23:24.160 --> 01:23:25.000]   - There may be.
[01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:26.880]   - One time my friend that I signed at 1999
[01:23:26.880 --> 01:23:28.200]   when the Star Wars movie came out,
[01:23:28.200 --> 01:23:32.200]   we had some cocktails and we found a pizza hut box
[01:23:32.200 --> 01:23:33.800]   with a picture of Anakin Skywalker on it,
[01:23:33.800 --> 01:23:35.520]   and we signed it and sold it on eBay.
[01:23:35.520 --> 01:23:36.520]   (laughs)
[01:23:36.520 --> 01:23:37.360]   - Whose name did you sign up?
[01:23:37.360 --> 01:23:38.640]   - Anakin Skywalker.
[01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:39.840]   - Why not?
[01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:41.040]   - Well, I mean, you don't get that every day.
[01:23:41.040 --> 01:23:41.880]   - No.
[01:23:41.880 --> 01:23:43.800]   - You didn't sign it, wait a minute,
[01:23:43.800 --> 01:23:45.080]   you didn't sign it, Mark Hamill.
[01:23:45.080 --> 01:23:46.000]   - No.
[01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:47.840]   - You signed it Anakin Skywalker.
[01:23:47.840 --> 01:23:49.520]   - Yeah, I don't wanna just spoiler alert,
[01:23:49.520 --> 01:23:50.520]   but yeah, I mean.
[01:23:50.520 --> 01:23:51.360]   (laughs)
[01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:52.200]   - Two.
[01:23:52.200 --> 01:23:54.480]   (imitates phone ringing)
[01:23:54.480 --> 01:23:55.320]   - Footnote.
[01:23:55.320 --> 01:23:56.600]   - Erm.
[01:23:56.600 --> 01:23:58.320]   - Wait a minute, Anakin Skywalker,
[01:23:58.320 --> 01:24:01.240]   no, you that would have it, David Prowst should sign it.
[01:24:01.240 --> 01:24:04.200]   Oh, was that a spoiler?
[01:24:04.200 --> 01:24:06.280]   - My daughter now walks around the playground
[01:24:06.280 --> 01:24:08.880]   spoiling the Empire Strikes Back for every other kid,
[01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:09.720]   by the way.
[01:24:09.720 --> 01:24:11.440]   ♪ And by the way, it starts begging ♪
[01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:12.880]   - And she always says, but it's a secret
[01:24:12.880 --> 01:24:14.040]   after she tells him, they understand her.
[01:24:14.040 --> 01:24:15.120]   - It's a secret.
[01:24:15.120 --> 01:24:16.120]   Oh, that's sad.
[01:24:16.120 --> 01:24:16.960]   - Yeah, I'm a bad dad.
[01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:18.120]   - It's terrible. - Very bad dad.
[01:24:18.120 --> 01:24:19.920]   - How does she even know?
[01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:20.760]   Did you tell her?
[01:24:20.760 --> 01:24:22.400]   - Certainly not because she's watched.
[01:24:22.400 --> 01:24:23.320]   - You told her.
[01:24:23.320 --> 01:24:28.440]   Eagle singer Don Henley says that
[01:24:28.440 --> 01:24:30.280]   the electronic frontier foundation
[01:24:30.280 --> 01:24:33.120]   and Google aid and abet criminals.
[01:24:34.800 --> 01:24:38.600]   In a op-ed piece in USA Today this week,
[01:24:38.600 --> 01:24:40.360]   Don Henley, who was the drummer, was he not?
[01:24:40.360 --> 01:24:43.160]   - He was the drummer and vocalist, occasional vocalist.
[01:24:43.160 --> 01:24:45.560]   - He says that blocking rogue websites,
[01:24:45.560 --> 01:24:46.800]   banning them from search engines
[01:24:46.800 --> 01:24:48.640]   and cutting off their advertising and credit cards
[01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:51.760]   is just common sense.
[01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:54.160]   He's talking about the Protect IP Act,
[01:24:54.160 --> 01:24:57.000]   which is in fact far from common sense,
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:58.640]   and breaks the internet.
[01:24:58.640 --> 01:25:01.620]   That's what the EFF says.
[01:25:01.620 --> 01:25:04.240]   Eric Schmidt says it's a disastrous
[01:25:04.240 --> 01:25:06.840]   precedent for freedom of speech.
[01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:08.760]   He says there's no First Amendment right
[01:25:08.760 --> 01:25:10.640]   to infringe intellectual property.
[01:25:10.640 --> 01:25:13.800]   See, he's gonna be the new Lars Ulrich
[01:25:13.800 --> 01:25:15.520]   for the 21st century.
[01:25:15.520 --> 01:25:18.000]   And by the way, that went well for Lars.
[01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.360]   Lars is now making appearances,
[01:25:20.360 --> 01:25:22.720]   making fun of himself.
[01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:24.920]   He was in, what movie was he in?
[01:25:24.920 --> 01:25:27.680]   Get him to the Greek.
[01:25:27.680 --> 01:25:28.960]   And he mocked him. - I'm right, right.
[01:25:28.960 --> 01:25:29.960]   - And he mocked him.
[01:25:29.960 --> 01:25:33.320]   In fact, I think, and get him to the Greek.
[01:25:33.320 --> 01:25:37.960]   Didn't the comedian, what's the British?
[01:25:37.960 --> 01:25:39.400]   - Russell Brand? - Did Russell Brand say
[01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:40.240]   Russell Brand, yeah. - Russell Brand, yeah.
[01:25:40.240 --> 01:25:41.840]   - Go to Napster or something.
[01:25:41.840 --> 01:25:42.680]   - They're right.
[01:25:42.680 --> 01:25:44.640]   (laughing)
[01:25:44.640 --> 01:25:46.080]   - So just Don Henley, I'm just telling you
[01:25:46.080 --> 01:25:46.920]   what your future holds.
[01:25:46.920 --> 01:25:48.240]   - We're pulling out of the in and out,
[01:25:48.240 --> 01:25:49.120]   just down the street.
[01:25:49.120 --> 01:25:50.200]   - Yeah. - And played our daughter,
[01:25:50.200 --> 01:25:51.520]   Master of Puppets for the first time.
[01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:53.400]   - Oh, that must be her battery, thank you.
[01:25:53.400 --> 01:25:54.720]   - That's a moment. - Yeah, battery.
[01:25:54.720 --> 01:25:55.560]   - That's a moment.
[01:25:55.560 --> 01:25:56.720]   (imitates motor revving)
[01:25:56.720 --> 01:25:59.280]   - She's, she like the drums.
[01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:01.000]   - You haven't played, no, but you're not,
[01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:02.720]   you haven't yet played her...
[01:26:03.720 --> 01:26:08.640]   - Uh, exit night, into light.
[01:26:08.640 --> 01:26:09.640]   - No, we're starting with the classic
[01:26:09.640 --> 01:26:12.400]   side one, Master of Puppets, no mayhem, no venom.
[01:26:12.400 --> 01:26:13.240]   - No venom, okay. - And so she's
[01:26:13.240 --> 01:26:14.480]   into at least six.
[01:26:14.480 --> 01:26:16.400]   - You have to never, never land.
[01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:17.640]   (laughing)
[01:26:17.640 --> 01:26:18.480]   - All right.
[01:26:18.480 --> 01:26:19.320]   - Mm.
[01:26:19.320 --> 01:26:21.600]   - Rattle.
[01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:23.120]   - More than a rattle.
[01:26:23.120 --> 01:26:24.280]   A Metallica rattle.
[01:26:24.280 --> 01:26:25.560]   - That's a question about the Kindle thing.
[01:26:25.560 --> 01:26:26.760]   - Yes, quickly. - Okay.
[01:26:26.760 --> 01:26:28.680]   So it seems to me that one of the benefits,
[01:26:28.680 --> 01:26:29.520]   I don't want to take you out there.
[01:26:29.520 --> 01:26:31.200]   - We don't want to stop the rattle, but okay.
[01:26:31.200 --> 01:26:32.200]   - I think the Kindle thing is huge.
[01:26:32.200 --> 01:26:33.040]   - It's a rattle for the rattle.
[01:26:33.040 --> 01:26:34.720]   - I came to love my Kindle, but like,
[01:26:34.720 --> 01:26:36.960]   do you, how much do you think they put
[01:26:36.960 --> 01:26:38.080]   into the whole battery life thing?
[01:26:38.080 --> 01:26:39.560]   'Cause I'm finding I love the long, long...
[01:26:39.560 --> 01:26:40.760]   - It's making a battery.
[01:26:40.760 --> 01:26:43.440]   - Well, hey, I got a lot of problems.
[01:26:43.440 --> 01:26:47.120]   But I love, I love the long battery life of my iPad.
[01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:49.920]   I love the crazy long battery life of my Kindle.
[01:26:49.920 --> 01:26:50.760]   - Right.
[01:26:50.760 --> 01:26:52.080]   - How much trade off do you think you can afford
[01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:54.880]   to make in battery life to bring in something like
[01:26:54.880 --> 01:26:56.240]   what H.264 video?
[01:26:56.240 --> 01:26:57.600]   I mean, what's, I don't know what the most power...
[01:26:57.600 --> 01:26:58.480]   - Oh, you get that battery life
[01:26:58.480 --> 01:26:59.960]   'cause that thing is an e-ink screen.
[01:26:59.960 --> 01:27:00.800]   It doesn't do anything.
[01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:01.640]   - You know what I'm saying?
[01:27:01.640 --> 01:27:02.480]   - It's just, it's just, it's just,
[01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:04.440]   it's just you're playing video, you're kinda screwed.
[01:27:04.440 --> 01:27:06.560]   Actually, this is germane because one of the things
[01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:09.440]   people said about the touchpad is the reason it's so sluggish
[01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:11.400]   is because it didn't have the optimizations
[01:27:11.400 --> 01:27:12.800]   that Apple made for the iPad.
[01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:13.960]   - It's so optimized.
[01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:16.400]   I mean, every other tablet, one of the big differences
[01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:19.640]   between the iPad and the Zoom and everything else
[01:27:19.640 --> 01:27:21.600]   is the battery life and almost all of them is bad.
[01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:22.920]   - And the responsiveness.
[01:27:22.920 --> 01:27:26.400]   - I think the, the RAM playbook is kind of the only other one
[01:27:26.400 --> 01:27:27.920]   where the battery life seems to be pretty good.
[01:27:27.920 --> 01:27:29.280]   - Right.
[01:27:29.280 --> 01:27:32.280]   - But yeah, Apple, I mean, it designed its own chip.
[01:27:32.280 --> 01:27:34.080]   It puts way more thought in that experience
[01:27:34.080 --> 01:27:35.280]   and it pays off.
[01:27:35.280 --> 01:27:36.480]   - There's advantage, for instance,
[01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:39.040]   if you know you're not gonna be doing flash,
[01:27:39.040 --> 01:27:41.760]   you can make a simpler chip that is more efficient.
[01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:42.760]   - Does that question make sense though?
[01:27:42.760 --> 01:27:46.400]   'Cause other people value battery life as much as I do
[01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:47.520]   and even if we take the grid,
[01:27:47.520 --> 01:27:49.200]   they don't wanna spend that much on an iPad.
[01:27:49.200 --> 01:27:50.680]   If they pick up the Kindle with the Facebook
[01:27:50.680 --> 01:27:51.920]   and the store and the whatnot,
[01:27:51.920 --> 01:27:54.640]   are they gonna expect 13 to 20 and go even?
[01:27:54.640 --> 01:27:58.280]   Are they gonna expect 13 to 20 hours of battery life?
[01:27:58.280 --> 01:27:59.480]   - They pop in one life to live
[01:27:59.480 --> 01:28:01.480]   and suddenly they go down to like 2%.
[01:28:01.480 --> 01:28:03.800]   Is that gonna happen on a pad like that?
[01:28:03.800 --> 01:28:07.880]   - Well, even the iPad, the battery life drops really quickly
[01:28:07.880 --> 01:28:09.040]   once you start watching video.
[01:28:09.040 --> 01:28:11.480]   You watch two-hour movie on it and it's at 100
[01:28:11.480 --> 01:28:14.960]   and you'll be down to about 60, 55% on the battery
[01:28:14.960 --> 01:28:16.040]   when you're done with the movie.
[01:28:16.040 --> 01:28:17.040]   - Yeah, when it's just pretty impressive.
[01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:18.400]   - That is still pretty impressive.
[01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:22.040]   And if Amazon wants to sell movies through that,
[01:28:22.040 --> 01:28:24.520]   they're gonna have to do probably at least that good.
[01:28:24.520 --> 01:28:27.400]   - I think it's intriguing.
[01:28:27.400 --> 01:28:29.160]   I think we're in the 90s, they start to put out those things.
[01:28:29.160 --> 01:28:31.080]   Like, this is great, you buy your grandma this thing
[01:28:31.080 --> 01:28:32.640]   and it's like got a phone and email
[01:28:32.640 --> 01:28:33.640]   and it's all you'll ever need.
[01:28:33.640 --> 01:28:35.720]   It seems like along the lines of like the success
[01:28:35.720 --> 01:28:37.840]   HP seems to have had with these all-in-one devices
[01:28:37.840 --> 01:28:40.400]   in the past, it just seems like that's been the wet dream
[01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:41.400]   for a lot of these companies.
[01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:43.440]   It's to come up with the mom and pop thing
[01:28:43.440 --> 01:28:44.680]   that you can truck around.
[01:28:44.680 --> 01:28:45.600]   I think Harry's probably right,
[01:28:45.600 --> 01:28:47.040]   a lot of people are not gonna wanna go out
[01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:49.080]   and spend time. - That's the iPad.
[01:28:49.080 --> 01:28:50.800]   - Well, but if I hear what Harry's saying,
[01:28:50.800 --> 01:28:52.560]   he's saying there are always gonna be people
[01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:54.160]   who think $500 is too costly.
[01:28:54.160 --> 01:28:55.000]   - Right.
[01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:56.240]   - Which I think is a little bit of a stretch.
[01:28:56.240 --> 01:28:58.960]   I'm seeing more and more iPhones, you know, I'm seeing more.
[01:28:58.960 --> 01:29:00.480]   - Yeah, but we're in the Lotus Land.
[01:29:00.480 --> 01:29:02.200]   We're not in mainstream America.
[01:29:02.200 --> 01:29:03.040]   - Right, it's in Blackberry now,
[01:29:03.040 --> 01:29:04.320]   it's become like the kind of like go around
[01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:06.920]   and get around for most regular people
[01:29:06.920 --> 01:29:08.920]   that that's not the upscale enterprise marketing.
[01:29:08.920 --> 01:29:09.760]   - The Blackberry.
[01:29:09.760 --> 01:29:13.240]   We are going to take a little break
[01:29:13.240 --> 01:29:14.360]   and check in with Tom Merritt.
[01:29:14.360 --> 01:29:16.760]   He's in the TNT newsroom, TNT, of course,

[01:31:09.240 --> 01:31:11.360]   That's coming up in a couple of weeks, isn't it?
[01:31:11.360 --> 01:31:12.560]   - Yeah, I'm going to be there all week.
[01:31:12.560 --> 01:31:14.320]   Try the fish.
[01:31:14.320 --> 01:31:16.960]   - I think we are because, you know,
[01:31:16.960 --> 01:31:18.280]   Paul Theron and Mary Jo Foley,
[01:31:18.280 --> 01:31:19.800]   the hosts of our Windows Weekly show,
[01:31:19.800 --> 01:31:23.240]   are hosting the Blogger Bash,
[01:31:23.240 --> 01:31:25.960]   the Build-A-Blogger Bash, BuildBlogger Bash.com.
[01:31:25.960 --> 01:31:27.880]   - Oh, I need to get an invite to that.
[01:31:27.880 --> 01:31:28.720]   - I can get you in.
[01:31:28.720 --> 01:31:29.720]   I know some people. - I'll be there.
[01:31:29.720 --> 01:31:30.560]   - Okay.
[01:31:30.560 --> 01:31:31.560]   - Yeah, well, you should be there, actually.
[01:31:31.560 --> 01:31:33.920]   And they're doing that. - Yeah, you'd be invited too.
[01:31:33.920 --> 01:31:34.760]   - Are you going to go?
[01:31:34.760 --> 01:31:35.400]   - Yeah, I'll be able to build.
[01:31:35.400 --> 01:31:40.400]   - And the Lattermilks, Travis and his brother
[01:31:40.400 --> 01:31:45.440]   of the hosts of the Windows Phone Dev Podcast
[01:31:45.440 --> 01:31:46.480]   are going to be there as well.
[01:31:46.480 --> 01:31:48.760]   And I think, Ryan, that's his brother's name.
[01:31:48.760 --> 01:31:51.120]   I think we are going to do a little live stream
[01:31:51.120 --> 01:31:53.280]   and from the Build-Blogger Bash.
[01:31:53.280 --> 01:31:55.320]   But I wasn't going to go to Build itself.
[01:31:55.320 --> 01:31:58.200]   I was just going to go to the Blogger, the Blogger Bash.
[01:31:58.200 --> 01:32:02.520]   Build will be where we'll hear more about Windows 8.
[01:32:02.520 --> 01:32:05.480]   This is where we'll first hear the details,
[01:32:05.480 --> 01:32:07.400]   the real details of Windows 8.
[01:32:07.400 --> 01:32:09.320]   - Yeah, I think they're going to release a beta.
[01:32:09.320 --> 01:32:11.120]   I bet you anything they release a beta there.
[01:32:11.120 --> 01:32:13.320]   - A public beta, you think?
[01:32:13.320 --> 01:32:15.000]   - Could be.
[01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.480]   Or it'll be a developer's beta that they say,
[01:32:17.480 --> 01:32:19.120]   "Yeah, it'll get leaked."
[01:32:19.120 --> 01:32:21.440]   - Wow, do you think it'll be that far along?
[01:32:21.440 --> 01:32:22.280]   That's cool.
[01:32:22.280 --> 01:32:25.240]   - I think they're further along than they're leading on
[01:32:25.240 --> 01:32:26.640]   right now. - Interesting.
[01:32:26.640 --> 01:32:29.760]   What do you expect to be the key feature of Windows 8?
[01:32:29.760 --> 01:32:33.880]   - I think the tablet stuff has to be.
[01:32:33.880 --> 01:32:35.680]   And I think that's what everyone's looking at.
[01:32:35.680 --> 01:32:38.160]   And I love the Metro UI.
[01:32:38.160 --> 01:32:41.200]   And I think it has a lot of potential.
[01:32:41.200 --> 01:32:43.640]   And we'll see what happens when it's translated over
[01:32:43.640 --> 01:32:44.480]   to the tablet.
[01:32:44.480 --> 01:32:48.520]   I'm a little concerned about the idea of essentially
[01:32:48.520 --> 01:32:50.920]   having two interfaces and swapping between them.
[01:32:50.920 --> 01:32:53.160]   And the confusion that might lead to,
[01:32:53.160 --> 01:32:54.720]   but we'll see how they handle it.
[01:32:54.720 --> 01:32:56.840]   - What about you, Harry?
[01:32:56.840 --> 01:32:57.920]   What are you looking forward to?
[01:32:57.920 --> 01:33:00.080]   You covered Windows for years.
[01:33:00.080 --> 01:33:01.560]   - Yeah, I mean, well, the one thing they've shown us
[01:33:01.560 --> 01:33:03.360]   so far is this dual UI,
[01:33:03.360 --> 01:33:08.000]   where you can have a rather iPad like UI or classic Windows.
[01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:11.480]   I think it's possible though that doesn't really give us
[01:33:11.480 --> 01:33:13.440]   that good an idea of what's important.
[01:33:13.440 --> 01:33:16.520]   If you looked at Windows 7 when they first demoed that,
[01:33:16.520 --> 01:33:19.160]   they also showed touch stuff in Windows 7 first.
[01:33:19.160 --> 01:33:20.680]   And so people thought that would be really important
[01:33:20.680 --> 01:33:22.920]   in Windows 7 and it turned out not to be a big deal.
[01:33:22.920 --> 01:33:23.760]   - Not to be, yeah.
[01:33:23.760 --> 01:33:26.960]   - So I'm sure at build we will get some sort of beta
[01:33:26.960 --> 01:33:28.040]   and we'll get all the details.
[01:33:28.040 --> 01:33:29.600]   And it'll be a little bit clearer.
[01:33:29.600 --> 01:33:31.120]   - They're clearly influenced by Apple.
[01:33:31.120 --> 01:33:32.760]   This app store that they're gonna put in there
[01:33:32.760 --> 01:33:34.680]   is gonna be, I think, a big part of it.
[01:33:34.680 --> 01:33:38.600]   Microsoft's wanted to do this kind of subscription software
[01:33:38.600 --> 01:33:39.640]   model for years.
[01:33:39.640 --> 01:33:40.600]   It never really could do it.
[01:33:40.600 --> 01:33:42.920]   Apple does it and then now Microsoft can.
[01:33:42.920 --> 01:33:46.120]   - There have been a whole bunch of Windows app stores
[01:33:46.120 --> 01:33:48.160]   over and over again over like the last 10 to 50.
[01:33:48.160 --> 01:33:49.320]   - We have Vista had one.
[01:33:49.320 --> 01:33:51.240]   There was one in Vista that was very,
[01:33:51.240 --> 01:33:53.360]   they touted a lot and it just didn't go anywhere.
[01:33:53.360 --> 01:33:54.960]   - It feels like you could,
[01:33:54.960 --> 01:33:57.480]   if you could go there and buy your antivirus software
[01:33:57.480 --> 01:33:59.160]   on Vista, you know?
[01:33:59.160 --> 01:34:01.400]   - It feels very much like the tablet thing
[01:34:01.400 --> 01:34:03.960]   where for 10 years Microsoft pushed tablets,
[01:34:03.960 --> 01:34:05.120]   pushed tablets, pushed tablets.
[01:34:05.120 --> 01:34:06.960]   And it's got to kill Bill Gates.
[01:34:06.960 --> 01:34:07.960]   And Apple comes along and goes,
[01:34:07.960 --> 01:34:11.120]   hey, how about this tablet and it's like all over.
[01:34:11.120 --> 01:34:13.600]   And now the same thing with app stores.
[01:34:13.600 --> 01:34:14.720]   Just, it's about.
[01:34:14.720 --> 01:34:17.040]   - Hate to make it hard to buy antivirus software.
[01:34:17.040 --> 01:34:17.880]   (laughing)
[01:34:17.880 --> 01:34:19.320]   - Should be automatic.
[01:34:19.320 --> 01:34:20.520]   - Yes. - Should be automatic.
[01:34:20.520 --> 01:34:22.040]   - Vista button.
[01:34:22.040 --> 01:34:23.120]   - All right, we're gonna wrap it up,
[01:34:23.120 --> 01:34:24.960]   but I am so glad this was so much fun.
[01:34:24.960 --> 01:34:26.400]   Merlin, man, thank you for being here.
[01:34:26.400 --> 01:34:28.360]   - I'm sorry I came, but I'm really glad that you have me.
[01:34:28.360 --> 01:34:29.200]   - You're sorry you came.
[01:34:29.200 --> 01:34:30.480]   - Well, I'm always mess it up,
[01:34:30.480 --> 01:34:31.800]   but it's nice to be here and--
[01:34:31.800 --> 01:34:33.640]   - You have the worst self-esteem issues.
[01:34:33.640 --> 01:34:34.480]   I wish you would just--
[01:34:34.480 --> 01:34:35.480]   - I wish.
[01:34:35.480 --> 01:34:38.800]   - No, I, it's really nice.
[01:34:38.800 --> 01:34:41.280]   - My self-esteem issues suck so bad.
[01:34:41.280 --> 01:34:43.080]   - It's a humble brag, is that what that's called?
[01:34:43.080 --> 01:34:44.080]   (laughing)
[01:34:44.080 --> 01:34:44.920]   - Thank you for that. - Thank you for that.
[01:34:44.920 --> 01:34:48.040]   - You can catch Merlin at five by five.tv.
[01:34:48.040 --> 01:34:50.120]   He's back to work show.
[01:34:50.120 --> 01:34:52.720]   You are doing every week now with BitDan Benjamin,
[01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:55.040]   and I'm really thrilled at the latest edition.
[01:34:55.040 --> 01:34:57.520]   I'm not working in an abattoir.
[01:34:57.520 --> 01:34:58.440]   - With guest host.
[01:34:58.440 --> 01:35:00.600]   - Jonathan Colton.
[01:35:00.600 --> 01:35:02.320]   Is that the name of his new album?
[01:35:02.320 --> 01:35:03.240]   - Artificial Heart.
[01:35:03.240 --> 01:35:05.560]   - It's really, really good.
[01:35:05.560 --> 01:35:06.920]   I don't want, I'm not, I'm gonna plug this,
[01:35:06.920 --> 01:35:08.000]   but I will plug Jonathan Colton
[01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:09.440]   because he's a really good human being,
[01:35:09.440 --> 01:35:12.040]   and his new record produced by John Flansburg
[01:35:12.040 --> 01:35:14.080]   of They Might Be Giants is terrific.
[01:35:14.080 --> 01:35:15.160]   - I someday hope to get,
[01:35:15.160 --> 01:35:16.600]   they might be Giants performing in here
[01:35:16.600 --> 01:35:19.240]   as we did on the screensaver's stage several times.
[01:35:19.240 --> 01:35:20.280]   It'd be really fun to have them.
[01:35:20.280 --> 01:35:21.960]   We've got a little place right there
[01:35:21.960 --> 01:35:23.120]   that they could play their theorem in.
[01:35:23.120 --> 01:35:24.480]   - I know he's a fan.
[01:35:24.480 --> 01:35:25.760]   - It'd be fun.
[01:35:25.760 --> 01:35:27.480]   Please give my regards to Joko.
[01:35:27.480 --> 01:35:29.080]   Have we been working on Joko for triangulation?
[01:35:29.080 --> 01:35:31.120]   We're trying to get him on triangulation.
[01:35:31.120 --> 01:35:32.520]   He's kind of, he and Hodgeman
[01:35:32.520 --> 01:35:34.840]   are the regulars on our holiday special.
[01:35:34.840 --> 01:35:37.040]   And by the way,
[01:35:37.040 --> 01:35:39.040]   we still have two giant bottles of Jaeger Meister
[01:35:39.040 --> 01:35:39.880]   in the fridge.
[01:35:39.880 --> 01:35:42.880]   If you would like to give it to Joko as our gift,
[01:35:42.880 --> 01:35:44.880]   actually it was Paul and Storm that really started that one.
[01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:46.480]   - Ooh, ooh.
[01:35:46.480 --> 01:35:48.720]   Harry McCracken,
[01:35:48.720 --> 01:35:50.160]   Technologizer.com,
[01:35:50.160 --> 01:35:51.760]   so great that you could come up.
[01:35:51.760 --> 01:35:53.320]   It was very nice to meet you in person.
[01:35:53.320 --> 01:35:54.320]   - Nice to see you in person, Dave.
[01:35:54.320 --> 01:35:55.160]   - Thanks for coming.
[01:35:55.160 --> 01:35:56.000]   I really appreciate it.
[01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:57.200]   And of course, Dwight Silverman,
[01:35:57.200 --> 01:35:58.000]   next time you're in town,
[01:35:58.000 --> 01:35:59.200]   please come by Dwight, we'd love him.
[01:35:59.200 --> 01:36:01.320]   - I will, by the way, it's cooled off now.
[01:36:01.320 --> 01:36:02.680]   It's only 4.
[01:36:02.680 --> 01:36:04.160]   - Oh, yeah.
[01:36:04.160 --> 01:36:05.880]   - And it's like six at night, right?
[01:36:05.880 --> 01:36:07.280]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:36:07.280 --> 01:36:08.360]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:36:08.360 --> 01:36:09.400]   - Yeah, it's almost seven o'clock.
[01:36:09.400 --> 01:36:12.040]   - Stay cool and keep your wife out of the kitchen, okay?
[01:36:12.040 --> 01:36:12.920]   - All right, all right.
[01:36:12.920 --> 01:36:14.360]   Hey, thanks everybody for joining us.
[01:36:14.360 --> 01:36:15.640]   Don't forget we do this show.
[01:36:15.640 --> 01:36:18.920]   Every Sunday afternoon, 3 p.m. Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern time,
[01:36:18.920 --> 01:36:21.320]   2200 UTC at live.twit.tv.
[01:36:21.320 --> 01:36:22.680]   You can watch live.
[01:36:22.680 --> 01:36:25.960]   Our new website is about to go live.
[01:36:25.960 --> 01:36:27.280]   It's been in beta.
[01:36:27.280 --> 01:36:28.280]   We've been working hard on it
[01:36:28.280 --> 01:36:30.760]   with the folks at ImageX Media in Vancouver.
[01:36:30.760 --> 01:36:34.040]   And I think by the time this show goes out
[01:36:34.040 --> 01:36:37.560]   across the podcast airwaves,
[01:36:37.560 --> 01:36:40.240]   twit.tv will look just a little bit different.
[01:36:40.240 --> 01:36:42.080]   We would love to get your feedback.
[01:36:42.080 --> 01:36:43.280]   Let us know what you think of it.
[01:36:43.280 --> 01:36:45.720]   Let us know what we can do to make it better.
[01:36:45.720 --> 01:36:48.400]   We're glad we could finally get that approved.
[01:36:48.400 --> 01:36:49.680]   Thanks everybody for being here.
[01:36:49.680 --> 01:36:51.840]   Another twit is in the can.
[01:36:51.840 --> 01:36:53.560]   - This is amazing.
[01:36:53.560 --> 01:36:56.160]   (upbeat music)
[01:36:56.160 --> 01:36:57.200]   - I wanna twit.
[01:36:57.200 --> 01:36:58.040]   - Do it on the twit.
[01:36:58.040 --> 01:36:59.040]   All right.
[01:36:59.040 --> 01:37:00.880]   - Do it on the twit, baby.
[01:37:00.880 --> 01:37:01.720]   Do it on the twit.
[01:37:01.720 --> 01:37:02.560]   All right.
[01:37:02.560 --> 01:37:03.400]   - What were you saying here?
[01:37:03.400 --> 01:37:04.240]   - I was just saying I went on a tour
[01:37:04.240 --> 01:37:05.480]   of the Computer History Museum,
[01:37:05.480 --> 01:37:08.040]   which was led by Steve Wozniak.
[01:37:08.040 --> 01:37:08.880]   - Wow.
[01:37:08.880 --> 01:37:10.040]   - Which is, that's pretty cool.
[01:37:10.040 --> 01:37:12.040]   - It's kinda like touring the Holy Land with Moses.
[01:37:12.040 --> 01:37:12.880]   - Yeah.
[01:37:12.880 --> 01:37:15.320]   - We kept seeing all these important machines
[01:37:15.320 --> 01:37:16.320]   dating back to the 60s,
[01:37:16.320 --> 01:37:18.640]   and he would tell stories about when he used that machine.
[01:37:18.640 --> 01:37:20.960]   Oh, not almost like he walked by a machine
[01:37:20.960 --> 01:37:22.520]   without stopping.
[01:37:22.520 --> 01:37:23.680]   And that machine was the Apple II,
[01:37:23.680 --> 01:37:26.720]   which was the only one he didn't plug.
[01:37:26.720 --> 01:37:28.360]   - That's how unassuming he is, you know?
[01:37:28.360 --> 01:37:30.520]   - Yeah, Robert Scubble had to get him to stop
[01:37:30.520 --> 01:37:31.520]   and pose with the Apple II.
[01:37:31.520 --> 01:37:32.360]   - It's amazing.
[01:37:32.360 --> 01:37:34.280]   He's just so great.
[01:37:34.280 --> 01:37:35.920]   It's really an amazing film.
[01:37:35.920 --> 01:37:37.320]   - He is a nerd.
[01:37:37.320 --> 01:37:38.960]   - Well, that's what I like about him.
[01:37:38.960 --> 01:37:41.120]   - You know, that's the biggest compliment for me.
[01:37:41.120 --> 01:37:42.120]   - He's unchanged.
[01:37:42.120 --> 01:37:47.200]   - Yeah, and it's funny that I think he enjoys
[01:37:47.200 --> 01:37:49.840]   how much people love what he's been part of,
[01:37:49.840 --> 01:37:52.160]   and I think that comes through in a way where,
[01:37:52.160 --> 01:37:54.200]   and I don't wanna bust a guy about jobs,
[01:37:54.200 --> 01:37:56.400]   but that's one of the things I find so inspiring
[01:37:56.400 --> 01:37:57.320]   about Steve Jobs is like,
[01:37:57.320 --> 01:37:59.960]   how much would you, I mean, as much as a character
[01:37:59.960 --> 01:38:03.960]   as Steve could be, to be around somebody with as much,
[01:38:03.960 --> 01:38:06.240]   cares as much about nerdy stuff as was,
[01:38:06.240 --> 01:38:09.680]   and then somebody who cares so much about making it good.
[01:38:09.680 --> 01:38:11.040]   Steve, like how much would you love to work
[01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:12.400]   for somebody like that, you know?
[01:38:12.400 --> 01:38:14.080]   - Steve's commitment to making it good, though,
[01:38:14.080 --> 01:38:17.680]   comes at a cost because it basically--
[01:38:17.680 --> 01:38:18.760]   - Like, burning bridges kind of cost?
[01:38:18.760 --> 01:38:20.880]   - Well, he's so laser focused that he doesn't have
[01:38:20.880 --> 01:38:23.520]   a lot of social graces, you know?
[01:38:23.520 --> 01:38:24.360]   - What was he?
[01:38:24.360 --> 01:38:25.360]   - No, jobs. - Jobs.
[01:38:25.360 --> 01:38:26.560]   - Oh, oh, oh.
[01:38:26.560 --> 01:38:28.480]   - Yeah, I mean, I think that that was--
[01:38:28.480 --> 01:38:30.440]   - Oh, well, I have a few of my own, but I mean, that--
[01:38:30.440 --> 01:38:32.000]   (laughing)
[01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:33.560]   - You still sit on his table, you know?
[01:38:33.560 --> 01:38:35.160]   (laughing)
[01:38:35.160 --> 01:38:52.640]   - But he-- - It was cloth mots
[01:38:52.640 --> 01:38:53.480]   and he says, "I don't mean to do it because I heard
[01:38:53.480 --> 01:38:55.000]   "that you're a serious man."
[01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:58.280]   You know, I think Steve Jobs don't have the only
[01:38:58.280 --> 01:39:00.520]   to make a value, I think he's a very serious man.
[01:39:00.520 --> 01:39:01.680]   - He's a serious man. - And I think he brooks
[01:39:01.680 --> 01:39:03.520]   no nonsense, and I think that is--
[01:39:03.520 --> 01:39:04.520]   - No, that's exactly right.
[01:39:04.520 --> 01:39:07.600]   - Well, you've heard Alex Lindsey's story
[01:39:07.600 --> 01:39:09.520]   about coming to a sitting--
[01:39:09.520 --> 01:39:11.520]   I don't think Alex was there, I think he heard this second,
[01:39:11.520 --> 01:39:14.120]   and sitting at a conference table with jobs
[01:39:14.120 --> 01:39:15.840]   and, you know, I guess it's a present--
[01:39:15.840 --> 01:39:17.440]   They do the presentations of what, you know,
[01:39:17.440 --> 01:39:20.640]   what we're gonna talk about, the keynote or something.
[01:39:20.640 --> 01:39:22.520]   And somebody says, "Well, I hope you had a nice weekend."
[01:39:22.520 --> 01:39:24.160]   And Jobs says, "Can we get down to business--
[01:39:24.160 --> 01:39:25.880]   "can we get down to--
[01:39:25.880 --> 01:39:27.400]   "waste a little less time and get down
[01:39:27.400 --> 01:39:29.280]   "a serious business here?"
[01:39:29.280 --> 01:39:30.600]   It's just very focused.
[01:39:30.600 --> 01:39:31.920]   I mean, I think that that's true.
[01:39:31.920 --> 01:39:32.760]   I think that's true.
[01:39:32.760 --> 01:39:37.680]   (humming)
[01:39:37.680 --> 01:39:39.120]   No small talk, exactly, right?
[01:39:39.120 --> 01:39:41.960]   I think, actually, he was kind of eluded to that a little bit.
[01:39:41.960 --> 01:39:43.960]   There was no lot of-- not a lot of smok.
[01:39:43.960 --> 01:39:46.240]   Elevate the tone, thank you, that was the line.
[01:39:46.240 --> 01:39:49.360]   He said, "Can we elevate the tone a little bit?"
[01:39:49.360 --> 01:39:51.480]   (laughing)
[01:39:51.480 --> 01:39:54.000]   Enough about this chitchat about the weekend.
[01:39:54.840 --> 01:39:57.440]   (phone clicking)
[01:39:57.440 --> 01:39:59.720]   All right, I think we're done, yes?
