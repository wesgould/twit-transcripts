[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.120]   This week in tech, the show that covers the week's tech news.
[00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.280]   And this week, we'll be covering next week's tech news as well.
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.240]   Joining me-- sometimes we call this show this particular
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.720]   version of the show the codger episode, the geyser episode.
[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.920]   Which my steps on Eric thinks is insulting to all of us.
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:54.920]   And it might be insulting.
[00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:55.680]   That's a tattoo too.
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.600]   But it happens to be the best episode
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.320]   we do.
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.320]   Eric says so.
[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.520]   Jerry says so.
[00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.320]   Silverman doesn't care.
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.800]   So say I.
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.840]   So John C. Devoreak is here in studio.
[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:07.880]   Good to have you back, John.
[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.200]   We missed you.
[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.360]   You weren't even working the show for the last month.
[00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.200]   We took a couple of weeks off for Christmas and New Years.
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.560]   So did you miss me up at the-- you were someplace--
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.960]   I went back east.
[00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.240]   But we do a best of on January 1.
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.160]   Christmas Day, we did a holiday special.
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.600]   So you're right.
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.200]   We haven't done a show a couple of weeks.
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.360]   It's nice to be back in the saddle, both of us, I think.
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.320]   Tell people about this weather we've got out here.
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.280]   It's beautiful.
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.400]   I feel like summer has come to Petaluma.
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.240]   It's weird.
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.200]   It is weird.
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.120]   It feels like the end tunnel.
[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.280]   It was creepy warm last night.
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.560]   We call it earthquake weather.
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.280]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.320]   Earthquake weather.
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.160]   Jerry Pornell's in Southern California.
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.720]   He's in his library looking great.
[00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.160]   Good to see you, Jerry.
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.320]   Been so late.
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.960]   Hey.
[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:53.200]   And also joining us, the young man of the hour,
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.600]   Dwight Silverman.
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:56.640]   I'm the baby.
[00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.040]   He's the baby from Houston, Texas.
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.040]   I can put up with being called a cudger,
[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.920]   but I'm not going to be--
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.080]   I'm not a geyser.
[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.240]   What's the difference?
[00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.040]   Oh, you don't know?
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.040]   A lot.
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.040]   It's not open up to you.
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.320]   The show's each young whippersnappers
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:19.040]   don't know much about the English language, doesn't it?
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.320]   It's great to have you guys on.
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.560]   We are going to CES.
[00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:24.760]   In fact, right after the show, we're
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.840]   going to have our first live feed from CES
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.120]   from the preview show.
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.400]   But I think it's very interesting that none of you guys
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.520]   are going to CES.
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.880]   In fact--
[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:33.600]   Isn't that great?
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:34.680]   Yeah.
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:35.200]   That's the--
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.280]   That's so good.
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.480]   That's how you know somebody's been covering tech too long.
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.600]   They say, I'm not going this year.
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:41.040]   I'm so happy.
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:41.800]   And loving it.
[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:42.840]   And loving it.
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.080]   It's over-covered.
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.120]   I did the calculation.
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.680]   There's four journalists for every booth.
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:48.440]   Yeah.
[00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.440]   You went last year, didn't you, Jerry?
[00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:51.440]   I did.
[00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.760]   And you decided not to do it again, huh?
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.960]   And I decided not to do it again.
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:56.760]   You got it.
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.600]   Why not?
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.200]   Too much effort for too little return.
[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.560]   I have plenty of people there who are covering things
[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.160]   and who will tell me if there's something I need to know.
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.440]   It's over-covered.
[00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.600]   Well, I think it's really-- it's just
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:13.720]   that the internet exists.
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:14.480]   You don't need to go.
[00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:15.880]   You don't need to have a trade show.
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:16.520]   In fact, this is--
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:17.600]   Now--
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.400]   This is the last year Microsoft will be at CES.
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.360]   And they don't need to be there.
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.400]   Who needs to be there?
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.440]   Yeah, I don't get anything from Microsoft at CES.
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.840]   It's the little guys that you pay attention to.
[00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.280]   That was the secret of the old West Coast computer
[00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:39.560]   fair was the little $100 booths where the startups were.
[00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.400]   Is there-- actually, that wasn't hyperbole.
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.560]   There really are four journalists per booth.
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.440]   Two, I think, or four.
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:46.360]   Two to four.
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.080]   That's just two, I think.
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.480]   I think this year they paid a little more attention
[00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:52.960]   to credentials in it.
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.600]   They didn't give a press pass to everybody who wandered up
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.000]   and said, hey, I'm a blogger.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.760]   But--
[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.280]   I'm not so sure.
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:02.200]   I don't know.
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:06.800]   But I remember last year meeting John in the press reception.
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.880]   And there were something like 1,000 people
[00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.200]   trying to get into it.
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.640]   1,000 people with press passes?
[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:15.480]   Wow.
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:19.480]   That was-- yeah, you couldn't get into the big announcements
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.800]   because they were all taken up with bloggers
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.200]   who came there and slept all night on the floor
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.120]   and flambered up front of the interview booth.
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.240]   Jerry, you're a blogger now.
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.480]   You can't dis-- you can't dis bloggers.
[00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:32.680]   Sure you can.
[00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:37.880]   I think I have more circulation than my wife and her relatives.
[00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:45.280]   The fact is they did allow bloggers a couple-- in fact,
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.080]   they were very liberal last year when you walked--
[00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.920]   because I came in late and I showed up at the press
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:50.880]   credential area.
[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.200]   And they just essentially didn't care to look at anything.
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.000]   If you showed up, they'd give you a pass.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:55.840]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.480]   Compared to maybe three or four years earlier
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:01.000]   where they were turning away bloggers and anybody who--
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.880]   and we're not talking about just kids.
[00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.600]   We're talking about real bloggers that were important.
[00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.280]   And I guess they caused such a fuss
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:09.120]   that they changed their policies.
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:09.640]   And--
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.640]   Do they have separate credentials for bloggers?
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:13.280]   No, no, this last--
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:13.760]   I think--
[00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:14.280]   I think--
[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:15.480]   Not last year.
[00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:18.240]   I think it said Blogger Press, didn't it?
[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:19.360]   The badge?
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:20.360]   No.
[00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.360]   I went last year.
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.480]   OK, well then, they said, well, I went to an event recently.
[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:25.600]   I went to an event recently.
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:27.120]   I can't say which one it was.
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:30.960]   But the badge said Blogger Press, where everybody was a Blogger
[00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:31.880]   or Press.
[00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:32.560]   Oh.
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:33.040]   Yeah, was that--
[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:34.040]   Blogger's an ant press.
[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.040]   You're one of the others.
[00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:35.560]   You're not--
[00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:37.160]   So you're part of the same click.
[00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:37.520]   Wow.
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:38.480]   I don't know what we are.
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:39.160]   We're going to be there.
[00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:40.440]   We have a sky booth.
[00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:42.760]   We'll be-- I said about-- there's about 15 people
[00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:47.360]   going this year, and we'll be doing wall-to-wall coverage.
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.120]   We're kind of like bloggers, so we're not really
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:50.400]   real journalists.
[00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.280]   Well, Jean, how's it going to be there?
[00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:53.160]   Is Jean going to be there?
[00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.120]   You're writing for Jean, aren't you?
[00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.240]   Yeah.
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:59.240]   So what happened to the bite thing?
[00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:00.880]   It's not my story.
[00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:02.120]   Get Jean over.
[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:02.880]   Well, we'll get Jean over.
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:04.160]   She wants to be on the show.
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:04.720]   We'll ask her.
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.160]   She loves-- she thinks you're the best.
[00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:10.440]   And she wants to know if you'll let her--
[00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:11.760]   What are you, her spokesman now?
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:12.440]   Yeah.
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:15.920]   She wants to know if you let her do additional distribution,
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:18.280]   so you can put the twit fee.
[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:19.680]   Are you writing for her, too?
[00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.120]   I'm working with her.
[00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:22.560]   She's put the name of her site.
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:23.440]   She put some weird name.
[00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:23.960]   It's like a--
[00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:25.160]   And a--
[00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:25.560]   What is it?
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:26.920]   No domain.
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.680]   A new domain, A and D.
[00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:32.120]   So she wants to know if it would be OK to use embed code.
[00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:33.000]   Do you allow that?
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:33.440]   Do you have it?
[00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:33.440]   Do you have it?
[00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:33.960]   Do you have it?
[00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:34.560]   For what?
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:35.440]   For the twit product.
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:36.680]   For the video cast.
[00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:37.040]   Sure.
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.040]   It's creative comments.
[00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:38.840]   You can do anything she wants.
[00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:39.920]   There you go.
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.000]   Gina, gotcha.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.840]   She can edit out all the bad stuff.
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:44.040]   She's not going to do that.
[00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:45.960]   That takes work.
[00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:48.600]   But we'll know, too, that she edited out all the bad stuff.
[00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:49.360]   You'll be at the top.
[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:50.920]   That's the control.
[00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:54.000]   So would you-- I mean, I could not talk about CES
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.280]   if you guys think it's a waste of time.
[00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:56.560]   No, I think we need a preview show.
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:57.120]   This will be it.
[00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:57.760]   Not a waste of time.
[00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:59.480]   There are some things to talk about.
[00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:03.920]   Last year-- well, two years ago CES
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:05.200]   was all about ebook readers.
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:06.800]   I think Amazon kind of--
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:08.080]   between Amazon Barnes and Noble,
[00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:09.280]   that's probably it on that.
[00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:10.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.040]   Amazon just owns the e-book space.
[00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:14.280]   My thinking is that this new CES
[00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:16.080]   is going to be about one thing and one thing only.
[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:16.600]   Well, wait a minute.
[00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:19.200]   Let's say, OK, last year was 3D TVs
[00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:21.440]   and tablets attempting to compete with the iPad.
[00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:23.640]   iPad 1, 2011, no question.
[00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:25.240]   Those tablets all disappeared.
[00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:27.880]   And 3D TVs are still here.
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:30.240]   I'm sure they'll be back next this year.
[00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:31.440]   What is it going to be this year?
[00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:32.360]   You said one thing and I think--
[00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:34.880]   I think everyone is going to flock
[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:37.440]   to see the 55-inch OLED.
[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:39.200]   Maybe four millimeters thick.
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:40.720]   Sharp, four millimeters thick.
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:41.840]   I'm sorry, LG and Samsung.
[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:42.200]   LG.
[00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:43.200]   Both are going to show these.
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:44.960]   I didn't know Samsung has one too.
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:46.280]   55 millimeters.
[00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:47.360]   But in both cases--
[00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:48.000]   well, in LG's case--
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.120]   It's 5 inches.
[00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:50.880]   They're an OEM panel maker.
[00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:53.800]   And it's not LG the television maker.
[00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:56.680]   It's the panel maker.
[00:08:56.680 --> 00:09:01.160]   So I wonder if Samsung may be closer to market.
[00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:02.000]   The ones are rumor.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.080]   I wonder if it's the LG panel being used by Samsung.
[00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:05.000]   Yeah, it could be.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.960]   There's a rumor that maybe Apple will adopt this LG panel
[00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:12.040]   before it's imaginary Apple TV.
[00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:14.720]   But thing is interesting to me is that Sony at the same time
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:17.080]   has killed its 11-inch consumer OLED,
[00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:18.920]   the only consumer OLED out there.
[00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:19.960]   It was too expensive.
[00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:20.520]   It was--
[00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:21.080]   2500 bucks.
[00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:22.080]   It was expensive.
[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:24.440]   And if they're going to do anything with the OLED,
[00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:26.680]   they've got to get the price down quickly.
[00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:31.760]   The prices for LED TVs just collapsed over the holidays.
[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:32.760]   Yeah, they're not something.
[00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:33.680]   Right.
[00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:37.360]   In order to compete, they've got to bring the price down.
[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:39.280]   Well, they've got to bring the price down.
[00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:43.600]   But don't we all agree that what with the Kendall
[00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:45.640]   fire and things like that?
[00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:48.360]   We are moving to an era in which there
[00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:51.240]   is going to be some kind of a pocket computer,
[00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:56.280]   like I described in "Mote and God's Eye" 50 years ago,
[00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:58.600]   that everybody's carrying around with them.
[00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:00.200]   It isn't quite the fire.
[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:03.960]   But the fire comes closer than a lot of the old ones,
[00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:05.520]   because it's fairly cheap.
[00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:07.280]   200 bucks?
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:10.720]   And I think that what you've got is
[00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:15.440]   that phones are too small for what you want them for.
[00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:18.320]   But men's clothing don't really have anything
[00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:19.680]   that you carry an iPad.
[00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:20.720]   You don't have a price.
[00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:23.160]   You have a jacket that holds an iPad?
[00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:24.960]   I have a Scott Evast and holds an iPad.
[00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:26.480]   Yeah, but I have a stock stock.
[00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:29.040]   It looks like a bustle, though.
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:31.200]   I want to wear a bustle.
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:31.880]   I disagree.
[00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:35.240]   I think for years, I carry--
[00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:37.960]   an Italian leather--
[00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:39.040]   A Finney pack?
[00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:40.280]   Oh, that-- yeah, a man purse.
[00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:42.560]   No, it was eight and a half.
[00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:45.880]   It was like nine by 13.
[00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:48.880]   And it would carry almost anything.
[00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:52.200]   And I think that one of these days,
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:54.640]   you're going to have a change in men's fashions,
[00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:57.360]   because it's just too dang convenient
[00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:00.760]   to be able to have a pocket computer that works
[00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:02.120]   and is easy to use.
[00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:03.200]   I'm thinking that the--
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:06.000]   I think I might disagree with you, Jerry, on this.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.920]   I think that the form factor of these four and a half inch
[00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:12.000]   and bigger smartphones is sufficient.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.320]   And they are easy to carry.
[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:15.920]   John's-- go ahead.
[00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:16.600]   Go ahead, John.
[00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:18.440]   Well, he's crappy.
[00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:21.680]   It may be right, but I would carry a fire.
[00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:25.240]   I could find a way to carry it if it were also a phone.
[00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:26.320]   I would love that.
[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:27.920]   Yeah, I don't know, because you don't want
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:29.520]   to hold a big thing to your ear like that.
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:30.800]   No, you use Bluetooth.
[00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:33.720]   I don't know, I can either use Bluetooth or heck,
[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:37.960]   I have nothing against a little wired gizmo that goes to it.
[00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:38.480]   Yeah.
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:40.800]   I don't want both ears.
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:41.760]   I like these four.
[00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:43.240]   This is a 4.65 inch.
[00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:44.080]   This is a nice phone.
[00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:44.960]   I think it's big enough.
[00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:45.760]   This is a galaxy of two.
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:46.920]   Too big for my taste.
[00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:49.040]   Well, you see I have a big battery bump on it,
[00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:50.680]   because I put a double sized battery.
[00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:51.160]   That's for--
[00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:52.160]   How much are you on the phone?
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:53.240]   You're never on the phone.
[00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:55.160]   You don't take email, and you never talk on the phone.
[00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:56.160]   No, that's what's interesting.
[00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:57.440]   And I'm sure you'll agree, too, Dwight,
[00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:58.600]   that these are not phones.
[00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:01.640]   These are computers that happen to have phone capabilities.
[00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:02.720]   Who uses these as a phone?
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:03.280]   Barely.
[00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:04.600]   Let me tell you something that's
[00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:07.000]   going to happen to all three of you.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.240]   You're all younger, man.
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:09.880]   You're going to get brain cancer.
[00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:11.560]   No, I don't use a phone that much.
[00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:12.080]   I don't like talking.
[00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:13.040]   In my case, I did.
[00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:14.680]   But let me tell you something.
[00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:20.200]   The legends about absent-mindedness in older people,
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:21.480]   they're all true.
[00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:24.080]   But the interesting thing is that I've
[00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:26.400]   got this little gizmo now.
[00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:26.920]   Yeah.
[00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:28.080]   And I can carry it around with--
[00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:29.120]   --and iPhone.
[00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:31.640]   And it basically--
[00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:32.640]   It's memory.
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:34.040]   --subsuits for the crazy millimeters.
[00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:36.400]   Well, especially with Siri, where you could say to--
[00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:37.800]   Now, you have an older iPhone.
[00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:39.440]   But if you had the 4S, you could say,
[00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:42.440]   remind me when I leave here to check if I flys up.
[00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:43.880]   And it would do that.
[00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:46.440]   Well, I'm getting the new one.
[00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:48.680]   I just haven't got around to it.
[00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:49.160]   She goes.
[00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:50.080]   But let me give you a thought.
[00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:54.040]   Leo is your fly up as I leave the place every day.
[00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:54.680]   Yeah, perfect.
[00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:55.160]   Yeah.
[00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:56.160]   Sounds good.
[00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:57.320]   I don't think that that's a good one.
[00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:59.960]   Perhaps an "mindedness" I had in mind.
[00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:03.800]   But the worst problem with getting old
[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:05.280]   is you forget names.
[00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:06.160]   Yes.
[00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:09.120]   And you forget names of things you wouldn't believe you
[00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:13.200]   had forgotten the name of as an example.
[00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:16.720]   The other day, I couldn't think of the name
[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:23.600]   of the famous dancer from the early movie days.
[00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:25.800]   Now, why I couldn't think of that--
[00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:27.560]   Fred Astaire?
[00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:30.360]   Well, you'll come down to it in a minute.
[00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:33.480]   And I couldn't even think of the guy who was at a rival.
[00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:35.960]   And I'm not, well, I need your name of his partner.
[00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:37.400]   I couldn't remember her name.
[00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:41.160]   But I was able to punch in here backwards and in high heels.
[00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:42.040]   That's it, Fred.
[00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:42.880]   Gene, Gene, Gene, Gene, Gene.
[00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:45.360]   And Gene, if it comes up, Jeanette McDonald,
[00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:48.160]   and there's Fred Astaire, and there's Gene--
[00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:48.960]   I don't think so.
[00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:52.840]   --and all those names, understand I knew the concepts.
[00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:53.200]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:54.240]   I knew who they were.
[00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:55.400]   But Google's good for that.
[00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:57.200]   John, I do that all the time.
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:58.080]   But their name--
[00:13:58.080 --> 00:13:59.560]   Google has become my brain.
[00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:00.480]   I completely agree with you.
[00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:01.520]   Jerry, it's turning pink.
[00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:03.680]   Jerry, you've turned into some--
[00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:06.600]   your aliens are trying to take you off the planet or something.
[00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:08.280]   We have to-- I don't know what we could do.
[00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:10.400]   Just slap the TV.
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:12.080]   I don't think it's-- is it this?
[00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:13.240]   It's not mine.
[00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:14.240]   I'm sure.
[00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:15.240]   There are.
[00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:18.400]   Mine owned a little screen down here, and it's just fun.
[00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:19.200]   Is it this TV?
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:19.720]   Is this mine?
[00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:20.720]   It's this camera.
[00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:21.520]   It's your camera.
[00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:22.520]   Your camera.
[00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:23.000]   It's his camera.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.080]   Yeah, it needs to be slapped.
[00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:25.520]   Whoa, now it's already--
[00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:26.360]   Oh, now it's already--
[00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:27.120]   --or punched.
[00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:27.600]   There you go.
[00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:28.600]   There you go.
[00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:29.600]   Perfect.
[00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:30.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:31.600]   I'm splashing.
[00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:33.340]   Oh, now it's like we're-- now you got half and half
[00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:34.080]   is finished.
[00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:34.920]   No, I agree with you.
[00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:37.800]   In fact, I was very disappointed that Google goggles--
[00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:41.680]   one of the things Eric Schmidt said this year was,
[00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:44.800]   we-- the one product that we had that we didn't release
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:47.640]   was the ability to do facial recognition in Google
[00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:49.000]   goggles.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.840]   And that would have been-- I just think awesome
[00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:54.040]   if you had your phone just kind of peeking out of your pocket.
[00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:55.760]   And as you came up to somebody and say,
[00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:56.800]   that's John C. de Vorak.
[00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:58.320]   You used to work with him.
[00:14:58.320 --> 00:14:59.680]   It would-- it automatically.
[00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:01.360]   And if it had the face recognition, we'd do that.
[00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:02.360]   I think that was something that they missed.
[00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:03.400]   It needs to work better than the--
[00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:04.040]   --in these four--
[00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:06.160]   --if you haven't turned up too loud.
[00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:06.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:07.680]   And Android 4.0.
[00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:09.320]   Well, it would be embarrassing.
[00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:11.040]   That's John C. de Vorak.
[00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:13.200]   Well, you know how I handle that, because I forget names,
[00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:14.600]   but I've always forgotten names.
[00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:16.080]   Because I don't know why.
[00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:16.720]   No, no, it says--
[00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:18.480]   And I always go, hey, you know, because you
[00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:19.200]   have to pretend to know.
[00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:19.680]   Right.
[00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:21.560]   Hey, I haven't seen it for a long time.
[00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:24.360]   So what are you doing? You have a new card?
[00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:27.000]   I always get it, because everybody in Silicon Valley
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.080]   always has a new job.
[00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:29.040]   They never have a work for a new card.
[00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:29.960]   Give me your new card.
[00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:30.280]   Yeah.
[00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:31.880]   And you get the new card, and you look at it,
[00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:33.000]   because you know they've changed jobs.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.240]   You're at Bloomberg now.
[00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:35.440]   That's interesting, Bill.
[00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:35.880]   Bill.
[00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:37.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:38.280]   Bill.
[00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:41.600]   So how can you listen to this particular episode
[00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:43.360]   and be upset that it's called the Geezer episode?
[00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:44.920]   Exactly!
[00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:45.840]   I warned you, folks.
[00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:47.200]   Listen to what we're talking about.
[00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:48.040]   I warned you.
[00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:49.720]   These are tips for you youngsters.
[00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:51.920]   You're going to do this age someday, kids.
[00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:53.160]   Really, my point--
[00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:53.680]   Yeah.
[00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:54.680]   --is your life.
[00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:55.680]   --is your life.
[00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:58.680]   My partner, Larry Niven, has had that kind of memory
[00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:01.200]   ever since I've known him in that 40 years.
[00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:01.640]   Yeah.
[00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:04.920]   He was nine years remembering the names of my kid.
[00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:05.420]   Yeah.
[00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:06.920]   No, I think that's normal for us.
[00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:07.440]   Smart people.
[00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:07.920]   Smart people.
[00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:08.420]   Smart people.
[00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:08.920]   His life.
[00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:11.440]   And many respects a lot of his social--
[00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:15.320]   and if Niven, who is one of the smartest guys I know,
[00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:17.560]   can have that absent mind and his problem.
[00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:20.080]   And by the way, the Vorak seems to have two.
[00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:22.240]   I remember on some of our trips.
[00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:25.240]   He didn't remember things I was sure he would have.
[00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:28.680]   So I thought, well, he's like Niven, isn't he?
[00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:31.680]   The olva is going away.
[00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:31.960]   Right.
[00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:34.040]   You're carrying a memory in your pocket.
[00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:35.880]   That was the point I was trying to make.
[00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:36.400]   I agree.
[00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:37.840]   I'm an old Geezer.
[00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:38.440]   No, I'm with you.
[00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:39.320]   Maybe I am.
[00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:41.240]   But the point is, is there a remedy?
[00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:42.760]   There's an app for that.
[00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:43.480]   No, no.
[00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:44.440]   I agree with you.
[00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:44.960]   I'm with you.
[00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:46.320]   And I think it's very exciting.
[00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:48.280]   And to me, this is the right form factor.
[00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:51.680]   But look at the point that is that no one form factor
[00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:53.040]   obviates any other form factor.
[00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:54.200]   You still can have tablets.
[00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:55.120]   You can still have desktops.
[00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:56.200]   You can still have all the various.
[00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:56.760]   And people usually do.
[00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:57.560]   And you will.
[00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:59.040]   It's not like you're going to say, oh, this is it.
[00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:00.360]   I don't need anything more.
[00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:02.400]   But I do love having these in my pocket.
[00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:05.040]   And I tell you, if I don't have a smart form of my pocket,
[00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:06.600]   I feel a little bit disconnected.
[00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:09.400]   If I don't have 3G, I feel a little disconnected.
[00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:10.160]   Oh, yeah.
[00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:11.840]   I wouldn't go out without mine.
[00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:12.840]   No.
[00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:14.880]   I've got it in my pocket all the time.
[00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:18.440]   I'm going to get the-- you don't like the Apple phones, do you?
[00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:18.840]   I do.
[00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:19.640]   I love the iPhone.
[00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:21.240]   I care if you like Apple.
[00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:22.000]   I don't like Apple.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:22.920]   I don't like any big company.
[00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:23.560]   I don't like Microsoft.
[00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:24.120]   I don't like Google.
[00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:25.480]   Now there's other reasons for you to like Apple.
[00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:26.760]   I am anti-corporate.
[00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:28.240]   I am like Germany.
[00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:29.600]   I don't like them.
[00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:30.040]   I don't like them.
[00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:32.360]   You're an anti-corporate, yes.
[00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:36.440]   It's kind of interesting because until jobs came back in '96,
[00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:38.160]   Apple was going to go away.
[00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:39.160]   Yeah, I know.
[00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:41.360]   They were three months away from bankruptcy, apparently.
[00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:44.080]   And now the second biggest company in the world, which
[00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:45.080]   is a name because--
[00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:45.440]   No, aren't they the biggest?
[00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:45.640]   Didn't they?
[00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:46.000]   No, they know.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.560]   They went back down.
[00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:48.040]   They went back down.
[00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:48.840]   Yeah.
[00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:55.200]   So this 55-inch OLED, four millimeters thick, it weighs 15
[00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:56.120]   pounds.
[00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:56.600]   Yeah.
[00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:56.960]   Imagine.
[00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:57.960]   That was 7.5.
[00:17:57.960 --> 00:17:59.280]   7.5 kilograms.
[00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:04.840]   Imagine carrying a 55-- it's like a plate of glass.
[00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:06.240]   Unbelievable.
[00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:07.760]   Have they said how much it costs?
[00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:08.160]   How much it costs?
[00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:11.640]   $10,000, which is even then unbelievable.
[00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:13.400]   Because remember those first plasma screens?
[00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:13.880]   $4,000.
[00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:14.880]   $4,000.
[00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:15.400]   Yeah.
[00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:17.720]   And they're the 42 inches that Pioneer had to win at the
[00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:18.400]   original show.
[00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:20.840]   They'd have burn in three weeks.
[00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:21.680]   They'd be burned in.
[00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:22.520]   $40,000.
[00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:23.720]   But it ratcheted down pretty quick.
[00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:26.480]   But if this ratchets down as fast, this will be under $1,000.
[00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:27.600]   Here's my question, though.
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:29.400]   And I'd love to get your guys' thoughts on this.
[00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:32.560]   I think there's a reason more than the price that Sony
[00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:35.640]   discontinued its consumer at OLED.
[00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:38.680]   I think the real problem with it was there's a technical issue.
[00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:41.960]   We've heard problems before about OLED, that the purple,
[00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:46.360]   the blue dye fades, that the screens don't last very long.
[00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:49.560]   I'm wondering if Sony knows something about OLED, that these
[00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:52.960]   guys don't know, that these displays are not very durable.
[00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:55.720]   To make the assumption that Sony knows something?
[00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:57.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:58.720]   I know nothing.
[00:18:58.720 --> 00:18:59.720]   Yeah.
[00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:01.360]   You don't think that that was-- that they were doing this
[00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:02.560]   because they knew--
[00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:03.080]   No.
[00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:04.760]   No.
[00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:05.920]   I think it didn't sell.
[00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:08.280]   And I think it didn't sell because it wasn't at the right
[00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:08.800]   price.
[00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:12.960]   And I think that Sony-- it's very difficult for Sony to sell
[00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:14.800]   anything at a discounted price.
[00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:15.880]   They don't like that, do they?
[00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:16.840]   They can't do it.
[00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:19.680]   So I think they just weren't able to move enough volume
[00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:20.960]   to keep selling it.
[00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:24.160]   We got to move these refrigerators.
[00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:26.120]   We got to move these colored TVs.
[00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:27.120]   Right.
[00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:28.120]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:31.200]   Well, I just thought--
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:32.480]   You do know I work with Adam Curry.
[00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:33.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:35.440]   Signed his constantly singing.
[00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:37.040]   Is he-- does he sing a lot?
[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:39.240]   Are you guys going to set up your response to SOPA?
[00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:42.720]   Are you guys going to set up your own no agenda show DNS
[00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:43.360]   server?
[00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:45.320]   Is that what somebody told me?
[00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:46.720]   I think somebody's doing that.
[00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:47.600]   That's hysterical.
[00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:48.360]   I mean, that--
[00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:49.320]   Not because of SOPA.
[00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:50.320]   SOPA's not going anywhere.
[00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:51.200]   We can talk about SOPA.
[00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:51.960]   I'll tell you about.
[00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:53.760]   I'm working with some lobbyists on SOPA.
[00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:54.400]   SOPA's going to--
[00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:55.400]   Because I've been working on--
[00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:56.400]   Because I've been working on--
[00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:56.400]   --stead already.
[00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:57.800]   But you know that they'll come back again and again again.
[00:19:57.800 --> 00:19:59.680]   My understanding from the lobbyists that are
[00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:02.640]   against the-- they're working for the ISPs
[00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:04.840]   say that SOPA is a smoke screen--
[00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:04.840]   Oh.
[00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:06.080]   --or this believed.
[00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:08.320]   It's a smoke screen for Protect IP, which
[00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:09.680]   is sneaking in the back door.
[00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:10.240]   The Senate bill.
[00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:10.840]   The Senate bill.
[00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:12.320]   They'll pass that rubber stamp it.
[00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:14.560]   And before anyone-- and SOPA guys in the meanwhile
[00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:16.720]   said, we lose, we quit, we're done.
[00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:17.400]   You win.
[00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:18.120]   And everyone says, yay.
[00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:19.120]   It's Pippa that we should be working on.
[00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:19.800]   We won.
[00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:20.440]   And then they lose.
[00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:23.040]   Does Pippa vary in any significant way from SOPA?
[00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:24.040]   I don't know.
[00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:25.600]   I haven't looked at the two bills side by side.
[00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:29.160]   But I'm told it's 96% as bad.
[00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:30.880]   Of course it is.
[00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:34.160]   The authors associations are looking at those things.
[00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:35.840]   And I don't know that much about them.
[00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:41.120]   I was fairly heavily involved in the 1975 copyright
[00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:45.520]   act of revision, because I was president of science fiction
[00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:48.120]   writer of America at the time.
[00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:49.600]   I don't know much.
[00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:52.600]   The DCMA is a piece of crap.
[00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:56.600]   And somewhere the DMCA, sorry, somewhere in there
[00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:58.880]   there's got to be a same copyright law.
[00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:00.920]   But I don't know whether this will have
[00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:02.040]   much to do with it.
[00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:03.880]   This is really more about just being
[00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:08.680]   able to take sites down quickly that the drop of a hat.
[00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:09.960]   Yeah, I understand.
[00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:11.600]   And that's a little scary too.
[00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:13.720]   Very scary.
[00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:16.400]   I wrote a column in PC Magazine this last Friday,
[00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:19.440]   I believe it was, called the National Internet,
[00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:20.920]   which is where I think everything's leading.
[00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:22.880]   Of course, you know I've always said that at some point
[00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:23.880]   would be licensing.
[00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:25.960]   You'll be a licensed broadcaster on the internet.
[00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:26.400]   Yeah, it's terrible.
[00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:27.600]   I hope that doesn't happen.
[00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:29.960]   But the national internet's an interesting idea
[00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:30.920]   and an interesting trend.
[00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:32.680]   It's a bad trend, a bad idea.
[00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:33.720]   But it's interesting.
[00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:34.760]   And it's--
[00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:35.800]   What we'll hack in.
[00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:38.480]   And I don't in the long run believe
[00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:41.000]   that any attempt to constrain the internet
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.080]   to protect rights holders will win.
[00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:45.480]   But what we will cause is a double-tiered internet.
[00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:48.160]   You'll have the official US government
[00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:51.520]   run the internet, which will be protect rights holders.
[00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:54.000]   And all that happens is the bad guys, the pirates,
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.760]   and anybody who wants a free and open internet,
[00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:57.000]   just go underground.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.760]   They're already talking about hackers
[00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:01.160]   are already talking about putting up satellites
[00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:04.240]   to create their own internet.
[00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:06.320]   Who needs it?
[00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:11.480]   The technology isn't really on the government side.
[00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:14.440]   Back when these little computers were first invented,
[00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:18.040]   I used to point out that they're kind of the great equalizer.
[00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:21.480]   Now everybody can keep files on everybody else.
[00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:26.200]   It's not just the government who can keep files on you.
[00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:28.240]   I don't think you can prove them.
[00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:30.440]   But the government owns an arsenal.
[00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:31.880]   The government has guns.
[00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:33.440]   The government has guns.
[00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:35.960]   The government has guns, but the people who carry the guns
[00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:37.040]   are called soldiers.
[00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:37.640]   That's true.
[00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:39.440]   And their dollar appears.
[00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:42.600]   And the army obeys its junior officers,
[00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:46.760]   not really the concrete guys in Washington.
[00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:48.000]   No, you're right.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.760]   Although that's why we're developing predators in other--
[00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:53.800]   Yeah, predator drones don't make orders from the non-cons.
[00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:55.520]   The generals run the predators.
[00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:57.920]   And that is the scary piece is that you
[00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:01.600]   have just like in the old Roman days where you had the emperor
[00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:04.160]   who could put your name on a prescription list,
[00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:06.400]   and they'd go out and find you and kill you.
[00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:07.600]   There's no trial.
[00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:10.480]   We've just done that with two American citizens.
[00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:12.640]   And that's a little frightening.
[00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:14.000]   If you want to know more about this hacker--
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:14.680]   Two that we know of.
[00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:18.000]   This hacker satellite network visit the Hacker Space Global
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.760]   Grid, a modular antenna grid for satellite communication,
[00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:26.040]   a fallback infrastructure to keep us connected.
[00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:28.040]   I think the hams have a better shot at this.
[00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:29.000]   The hams might do it too.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.400]   That's why we're hams.
[00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:32.360]   That's why we're hams, John and I are hams,
[00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:35.600]   because we want to preserve the free and open internet
[00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:38.040]   that you and I know and love.
[00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:39.480]   Moving on.
[00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:41.120]   I'll go ahead, Judge.
[00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:45.640]   No, I think that what we're overlooking
[00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:50.680]   is that in the last six months, something
[00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:52.920]   happened that has never happened before.
[00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:53.480]   What's that?
[00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:58.360]   Essentially, the publishing industry has just collapsed,
[00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:01.000]   and become unnecessary.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:01.760]   Think about it.
[00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:03.080]   But it's happened with music.
[00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:04.600]   It's going to happen with--
[00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:09.360]   But now it's happening with books and ideas and publications,
[00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:11.880]   and that's a fairly unusual situation.
[00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:12.640]   Well, I agree.
[00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:13.960]   This is a whole new world.
[00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:15.080]   And it's set thanks to the internet.
[00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:16.560]   But I don't think it's a bad thing.
[00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:17.800]   Do you think it's a bad thing, Jerry?
[00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:19.240]   I don't think it's bad.
[00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:20.800]   It's just the opposite of bad.
[00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:29.040]   Look, from in the last quarter of 2011, Amazon reports
[00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:34.080]   that their e-book sales went up by 600%.
[00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:36.200]   And it continues to grow like this.
[00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:37.640]   And continues to grow--
[00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:39.080]   So it's little.
[00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:44.600]   Their Kendall sales in December were 4 million units.
[00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:45.240]   Wow.
[00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:49.120]   And I know my personal sales tripled in December.
[00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:50.360]   How interesting.
[00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:55.360]   My income, my royalties, of which I get a lot.
[00:24:55.360 --> 00:25:01.320]   I have far more revenue coming from all my old back lists.
[00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:02.440]   I'm so happy to hear that.
[00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:03.200]   Amazon.
[00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:04.480]   I'm thrilled to hear that.
[00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:05.960]   I am too, because you're buying Jerry.
[00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:08.360]   Don't you dare hear anything?
[00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:10.360]   Jerry's buying, everybody.
[00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:11.120]   Yeah.
[00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:12.160]   No, wait, wait, wait.
[00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:14.080]   Before we go on, somebody was saying
[00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:15.920]   you're doing a new book with Niven.
[00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:17.640]   Yeah, Niven and I are doing--
[00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:21.480]   we still have a traditional contract on our next book.
[00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:24.480]   But Niven Barnes and I have just done a novella
[00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:27.120]   that our agent's just going to publish without bothering
[00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:28.000]   with a publisher.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.640]   And do you think that if you and Larry Niven
[00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:31.320]   do another book after this one, you'll
[00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:33.160]   have a contract or will you self-publish?
[00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:35.680]   I think if I just do another--
[00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:38.280]   Niven and I do another book after this one,
[00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:41.520]   I think it's very likely we'll just let our agent publish it.
[00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:42.280]   That's very telling.
[00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:43.520]   I think really it is the--
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:45.960]   there is a huge change afoot here in publishing.
[00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:52.280]   Because what happens is publishers traditionally
[00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:53.080]   furnish what?
[00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:56.400]   They have advances without needed advances.
[00:25:56.400 --> 00:26:00.360]   I can live on my income while I write.
[00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:04.480]   They furnish distribution and production.
[00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:05.520]   You don't need that.
[00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:05.960]   You don't need that.
[00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:06.880]   Copy editing.
[00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:07.720]   Copy that.
[00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:08.680]   You can do that.
[00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:09.160]   Yeah.
[00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:10.160]   Copy editing.
[00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:12.080]   Well, you get a freelance copy editor, can't you?
[00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:12.440]   Yeah.
[00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:21.080]   And the other two things publishers do is editing and publicity.
[00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:22.520]   And they do that poorly, by the way.
[00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:24.320]   Publicity anymore.
[00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:27.160]   The best publicity I know of right now
[00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:30.360]   is if somebody buys one of my books,
[00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:33.080]   Amazon shows down there at the bottom of people
[00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:34.200]   who bought this book.
[00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:37.640]   Also liked an issue about nine others of mine.
[00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:40.040]   And they sell a lot of them that way.
[00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:44.720]   As to editing, yeah, you really do need an editor.
[00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:47.040]   Now, when I work with Niv and that isn't the case
[00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:49.080]   because we edit each other's stuff.
[00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:52.680]   But authors are really pretty terrible at editing
[00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:53.520]   their own work.
[00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:56.440]   They really do need an editor.
[00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:59.840]   And that is the only thing left that publishers do
[00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:03.680]   that they used to do that you can't do with a $500 computer.
[00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:05.360]   But I kind of figured the person who's
[00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:06.840]   doing your editing at the publisher
[00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:08.680]   could just as easily be a freelance editor
[00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:11.200]   that you could hire, just as you hire somebody
[00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:14.600]   to do indexes or to do illustrations or cover design.
[00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:18.200]   All of them work for an agent, yes, exactly.
[00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:21.280]   Actually, there's more to it than that.
[00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:23.480]   Sometimes you're better off with an editor
[00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:25.320]   you work with that you like as opposed
[00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:26.880]   to some of the publishers who have
[00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:31.000]   assigned to eight whole editors that make your life miserable.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.080]   I never had that problem, fortunately.
[00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:34.760]   I have a lot.
[00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:37.720]   All of my bi editors were good people.
[00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:41.200]   I was John's editor at Infoworld when he first started.
[00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:42.600]   That must have been fun.
[00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:44.800]   Were you-- was he the A-hole and you were doing a thing?
[00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:47.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:48.760]   So John writes perils.
[00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:50.520]   Yes, it's white silverman.
[00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:54.720]   It's interesting that Jerry mentions his agent,
[00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:58.280]   the woman who was my agent on the books that I had done,
[00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:00.040]   the computer books that I had done,
[00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:02.520]   has become a publisher herself.
[00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:07.040]   She and Ed Bot have started a company called Fair Trade DX.
[00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:08.040]   That's interesting.
[00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:09.360]   And they're going to publish-- they essentially
[00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:11.760]   work with the authors and bypass the publishers
[00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:14.640]   and do their own publishing, mostly as ebooks.
[00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:16.400]   And they're going to do it for what 15%--
[00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:18.680]   And it's interesting to hear agents taking
[00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:19.760]   the part of publishers.
[00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:22.560]   That's-- the agents were kind of a middleman.
[00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:24.520]   And now they're stepping in and kind of
[00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:26.200]   stopping the flow right where they are.
[00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:27.480]   That's really interesting.
[00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:31.840]   Well, Dwight, more than that, publishers no longer
[00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:36.080]   have what used to be known as publishers readers.
[00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:38.240]   People who basically read the slush,
[00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:40.880]   because every publisher gets a far more manuscript
[00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:42.800]   than they can possibly publish.
[00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:44.680]   Somebody has to select that.
[00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:47.080]   A long time ago, the publisher decided
[00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:50.320]   to let the literary agents do that for them.
[00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:52.920]   So they never even read anything that isn't
[00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:54.960]   agented to begin with.
[00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:56.120]   Well, that's fine.
[00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:58.400]   If the agents are smart enough to figure out what's
[00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:02.280]   publishable, why do they need that blood sucking publisher?
[00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:03.280]   Exactly.
[00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:07.320]   Now they're replacing with a blood sucking agent.
[00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:10.360]   What you really want-- and you need to be careful.
[00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:14.040]   Let me-- anybody listening who's taking this conversation
[00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:17.440]   seriously pays some attention to what's going on
[00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:18.160]   on the internet.
[00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:20.400]   Christine, Catherine, Rush, had some stuff.
[00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:22.000]   There are a lot of people out there
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:25.240]   who claim to be agents who, in fact, are taking kids
[00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:26.120]   to the cleaners.
[00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:28.600]   It's astonishing.
[00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:29.360]   My agents are always--
[00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:31.760]   Well, that's the reason I have my agent do my stuff
[00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:34.640]   is because with her old books, she sold the books
[00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:37.200]   in the first place 30, 40 years ago.
[00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:40.000]   And she takes her 15% now, which is fine.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   We wouldn't have to give it to her.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.760]   But I just think it's fair.
[00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:46.480]   It's right to keep working with her.
[00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:48.320]   But there are a lot of people setting up
[00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:51.720]   what they call literary agencies out there who are really--
[00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:55.480]   they are-- well, they're thieves.
[00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:57.080]   Well, that's going to always be the case.
[00:29:57.080 --> 00:29:58.840]   I think that's been around for a while.
[00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:00.080]   Why go on be the case?
[00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:04.040]   But you guys are old hands and jaded.
[00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:05.440]   I don't think you--
[00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:09.000]   I still see a lot of desperate young authors.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.240]   Well, let me ask this question, because whenever I say--
[00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:12.760]   and I think we're all in agreement,
[00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:15.320]   that's what's going on is a complete disintermediation,
[00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:17.640]   a democratization of media.
[00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:20.760]   But whenever I talk about that, people say,
[00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:23.160]   oh, but what about somebody-- you guys are established.
[00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:25.520]   What about somebody new and young and coming up?
[00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:28.000]   How do they break into it?
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.040]   And I say it's better for them, too, don't you think?
[00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:31.040]   Yeah, they should--
[00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:32.040]   But how do they get noticed?
[00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:34.320]   They should give us their stuff for free.
[00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:35.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:37.880]   You know, I bring up as the example as Justin Bieber,
[00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:41.000]   who was a guy who didn't have a record contract, wasn't known.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:42.600]   He put his videos on YouTube.
[00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:44.960]   He is the biggest star in music today.
[00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:45.400]   And he's what?
[00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:46.960]   17 years old.
[00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:48.200]   And cute is a bug, though.
[00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:49.800]   He's cute is a bug.
[00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:54.240]   But that's the point, is that you can merit alone in this world
[00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:55.880]   can make it.
[00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:58.560]   Well, but if you want to get a promotion--
[00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:00.880]   Take a look at the photos.
[00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:02.200]   Make friends with me, that's right.
[00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:04.400]   And/or Gina Smith, probably.
[00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:04.920]   Or Gina?
[00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:06.800]   You still have to get noticed.
[00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:08.040]   But how do you get noticed?
[00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:10.200]   How did you ever get noticed?
[00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:13.320]   Come on, most people got into this racket
[00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:15.320]   because they went to conventions.
[00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:16.840]   They talked to authors.
[00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:19.240]   They made friends with existing authors.
[00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:21.840]   The authors introduced them to his agent.
[00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:24.760]   That's certainly how I got into it, Mr. Heinlein.
[00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:26.960]   Said, hey, I like what you're doing.
[00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:30.400]   Let me introduce a little learning blessing game.
[00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:31.320]   Who was his agent?
[00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:32.480]   What happens when that system--
[00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:33.480]   What happens when that system--
[00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:34.920]   What happens when that system--
[00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:37.200]   What happens when that system is disintermediated?
[00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:39.920]   When suddenly you have everybody has the ability
[00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:44.160]   to be seen on the internet, which is the thing with Justin
[00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:46.360]   Bieber, there's a lot of people who
[00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:48.280]   are out there putting their music on the internet.
[00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:49.440]   There's a lot of people out there who
[00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:51.200]   are doing great writing on websites
[00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:53.040]   and giving it away for free.
[00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:55.080]   That's kind of the new system.
[00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:57.200]   And how do you stand out from that system?
[00:31:57.200 --> 00:31:59.520]   That is the time you stand out in that cacophony.
[00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:00.080]   That's the hard--
[00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:02.440]   There is a cacophony because the more--
[00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:04.400]   the easier it is, the lower the barrier to entry,
[00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:05.760]   the more people are going to do it.
[00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:07.840]   But in the long run, that's a positive
[00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:10.560]   because that means there'll be more great stuff out there.
[00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:13.160]   And I do think in the long run, the cream rises, don't you?
[00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:14.880]   I mean, even if there's a lot more noise,
[00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:16.680]   we also have much better signaling systems.
[00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:19.640]   We have things like Twitter, Facebook, Google+,
[00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:23.120]   ways for you to signal that there's something great going on.
[00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:25.840]   I mean, I don't think Justin Bieber occurs without YouTube,
[00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:27.720]   but I also really don't think it occurs
[00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:30.800]   without Twitter and Facebook because he's
[00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:34.400]   fans who told other people, hey, if you like this,
[00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:35.440]   you would love Justin Bieber.
[00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:36.120]   And that helped.
[00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:38.240]   And the downside of this is that Rebecca Black--
[00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:42.120]   So at all, we were discussing Jack Woodford.
[00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:42.640]   Yes.
[00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:48.200]   Now, having mentioned Jack Woodford, who wrote as John and John
[00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:51.440]   will have brought him up in the first place.
[00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:53.040]   Let me just say who Jack Woodford was.
[00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:57.360]   He took the best books on how to write that were ever written.
[00:32:57.360 --> 00:33:00.440]   Now, that's really all I need to say on this show.
[00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:01.840]   I bought the book.
[00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:03.040]   He just bought the book.
[00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:05.640]   Yeah, if you Leo bought the book and I will bet you
[00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:08.040]   that Woodford's estate will--
[00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:10.280]   Thousands, thousands, thousands.
[00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:11.320]   Tomorrow morning.
[00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:14.000]   And the reason is the word of mouth
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.040]   from somebody like a Jerry Purnell or John C. Devorek
[00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:19.440]   is so much more valuable than any advertising,
[00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:22.120]   any marketing a publisher could do anything
[00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:23.040]   that anybody could do.
[00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:25.120]   That's valuable because you're writers.
[00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:26.880]   And you said, this is what you got to read.
[00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:27.880]   And it was enough for me.
[00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:28.880]   I think that was always true.
[00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:30.440]   That's been dead for 35 years.
[00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:31.480]   Well, it didn't help him.
[00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:32.640]   Yeah, it was always true.
[00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:33.360]   It's always been.
[00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:35.280]   Word of mouth has always been the best form of that.
[00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:38.080]   Well, or the Long John Knubble Show.
[00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:39.440]   I remember going on that thing.
[00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:40.440]   I love that show.
[00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:43.960]   And it was a radio show in New York City
[00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:46.600]   that went on at like 2 in the morning.
[00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:50.960]   And my agent-- I was invited to it.
[00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:53.200]   And I asked my agent, do you think
[00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:54.800]   it's worth my going to New York?
[00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:58.480]   And being alert and said, well, Jerry,
[00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:01.400]   there's an awful lot of insomniacs.
[00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:03.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:06.760]   And I must-- one of the things that made
[00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:08.920]   Mote and God's eye a bestseller was--
[00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:09.960]   Long John Knubble.
[00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:11.320]   Long John Knubble.
[00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:14.440]   The Joey Bishop Show, I was on the--
[00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:18.920]   you get people who are being already noticed
[00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:21.320]   to think highly of your stuff.
[00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:22.720]   You're in pretty good shape.
[00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:26.080]   I don't think the system changed that much in that respect.
[00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:28.160]   So it's all a net positive.
[00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:31.200]   You've got democratization, lower barrier of entry.
[00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:35.960]   Everybody who wants to write, sing, dance, make a movie,
[00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:36.720]   can do it.
[00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:40.320]   I've been trying to get on coast to coast AM for years.
[00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:41.600]   I can get you on coast to coast.
[00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:41.960]   Yeah?
[00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:42.600]   Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:43.360]   You want to be on coast to coast?
[00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:43.720]   Oh, yeah.
[00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:44.160]   OK.
[00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:45.960]   I do it all the time.
[00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:47.640]   I'll call Tom Danheiser, the producer.
[00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:49.800]   He's probably listening right now, Tom.
[00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:51.240]   This guy wants to be on that show.
[00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:51.880]   I don't know why.
[00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:53.080]   That's the crazy nut show.
[00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:55.080]   That's perfect for the Noah Gendish show.
[00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:56.560]   Oh, yeah.
[00:34:56.560 --> 00:34:57.480]   OK.
[00:34:57.480 --> 00:35:01.480]   This is Flying Saucer's Crop Circles, the host of it--
[00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:02.360]   the new-- it was Art Bell.
[00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:03.960]   And now it's-- oh, what's his name?
[00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:04.760]   George, Nora.
[00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:05.320]   George, Nora.
[00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:06.920]   You've been on heavy, Jenny.
[00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:08.400]   Oh, I've been on it.
[00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:09.160]   I love George.
[00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:10.400]   I was on Art Bell's show.
[00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:12.160]   And then I get-- then Adam can come on in later.
[00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:13.160]   I sell a lot of book to it.
[00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:14.360]   Because he's more than Daddy and I.
[00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:15.560]   Well, then George, Nora.
[00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:16.880]   You know what?
[00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:19.280]   I will call their producer, and I will get you and Adam on.
[00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:20.800]   That'd be awesome.
[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:22.520]   I heard-- I did it just the other day.
[00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:23.520]   I did it a couple of days ago.
[00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:25.640]   And you know, you're sitting there listening on the phone
[00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:26.880]   as they're doing their stuff.
[00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:28.840]   And George, Nora runs a promo.
[00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:31.760]   I think the government knows all about Flying Saucers.
[00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:34.040]   If you were the government and you knew about Flying Saucers,
[00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:35.840]   would you tell the people about Flying Saucers?
[00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:36.640]   Of course not.
[00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:38.960]   They know all about Flying Saucers.
[00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:39.520]   Oh.
[00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:42.080]   This is the show for me.
[00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:44.440]   I don't think you really want to make that much.
[00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:47.000]   I once asked George, do you believe this?
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:47.440]   No.
[00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:48.440]   All this stuff?
[00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:48.880]   No.
[00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:52.840]   And he looked at me and he said, I'm able to, well, it's on.
[00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:53.880]   Yes, exactly.
[00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:54.880]   He sounds really cool.
[00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:56.520]   And that's what makes him so--
[00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:57.480]   He's what got.
[00:35:57.480 --> 00:36:00.080]   He's the second most popular guy in radio.
[00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:01.600]   He doesn't have to believe that.
[00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:03.480]   He's just-- don't you think Art Bell--
[00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:04.640]   Art Bell did believe it though?
[00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:05.280]   No.
[00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:06.080]   No?
[00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:07.880]   I think Art Bell was the-- he was a genius
[00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:09.360]   at getting people to keep talking.
[00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:09.920]   Right.
[00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:10.520]   Yeah.
[00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:12.600]   And that's what you-- if you do an all-night show,
[00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:14.400]   that is the most important skill.
[00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:16.320]   Because you can't talk for four hours in the middle of the night.
[00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:17.760]   Oh, Dad, there.
[00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:19.360]   Just let him-- well, you were telling--
[00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:22.000]   I remember you telling me that when you were doing the late night
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:23.640]   Larry King show, the original Larry King radio show,
[00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:24.400]   he'd fall asleep.
[00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:25.440]   Yeah, he fell asleep on me.
[00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:26.240]   Yeah.
[00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:27.880]   It was funny because I'm doing the show.
[00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:30.760]   And Larry was always like to cut people off.
[00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:33.440]   So I mean, Albuquerque, you're on the air.
[00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:35.000]   And you go right from one to another,
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:36.200]   and he cut people off.
[00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:38.880]   And so some guy came on and was boring.
[00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:41.480]   And the guy's asking these crazy questions.
[00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:43.480]   And Larry falls asleep.
[00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:45.640]   So this guy is on the air.
[00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:46.920]   Larry's snoring over there.
[00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:48.000]   And he's not next to you.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:49.080]   So you can't poke him.
[00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:50.440]   It's like 2 AM.
[00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:51.720]   And he's a good ways away.
[00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:53.200]   You can maybe throw something at him,
[00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:56.760]   but you can't really touch him.
[00:36:56.760 --> 00:36:57.880]   So the guy's yacking away.
[00:36:57.880 --> 00:37:00.480]   And I said, is there anything else you want to talk about
[00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:02.960]   to get the guy-- because he was already done--
[00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:04.120]   until Larry woke up.
[00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:05.240]   And they're going to talk to this guy.
[00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:07.720]   And they're saying, Lewis, you're on the air.
[00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:10.520]   I had something like that happen to me on the Long John
[00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:12.760]   nebulch show, as a matter of fact.
[00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:13.080]   Yeah.
[00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:16.560]   Candy went off the bathroom and Long John got something
[00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:18.600]   caught in his room.
[00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:20.760]   I'm talking myself trying to--
[00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:22.760]   I discovered that I'm not cut out
[00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:25.920]   to be an all night talk show host.
[00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:26.920]   Yeah.
[00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:27.280]   That's a rough thing.
[00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:29.240]   I have always wanted to do a late night talk show.
[00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:31.760]   And I often thought of coming in here in the middle of the night
[00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:32.920]   and just doing it.
[00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:33.920]   Just doing it.
[00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:35.600]   Now I own my own--
[00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:36.600]   You could do whatever you want.
[00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:38.760]   I could do whatever I want.
[00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:39.600]   By the way, Art Bell is on--
[00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:41.120]   No, let me just take off.
[00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:43.440]   Art Bell is on 10 meters right now for your hands.
[00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:44.480]   You can get-- if you've got--
[00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:45.920]   What's he doing there?
[00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:46.560]   You know he's a ham.
[00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:47.280]   He's a big ham.
[00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:47.960]   Yeah.
[00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:50.400]   He's got a massive array in perump.
[00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:51.000]   In perump?
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:52.240]   In perump, huh?
[00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:52.800]   And--
[00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:54.480]   But he's not in perump.
[00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:55.520]   Well, he goes back--
[00:37:55.520 --> 00:37:57.840]   He goes back and forth between the Philippines and perump.
[00:37:57.840 --> 00:37:58.280]   Doesn't he?
[00:37:58.280 --> 00:37:59.040]   Really?
[00:37:59.040 --> 00:37:59.520]   I think so.
[00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:00.040]   I don't know.
[00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:03.440]   I know his wife had some kind of immigration problem.
[00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:04.920]   He moved to the Philippines for a while.
[00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:06.480]   But I think he comes back--
[00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:08.280]   No, he moved to the Philippines.
[00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:09.720]   He got married there.
[00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:09.920]   Right.
[00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:11.040]   He came back here.
[00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:12.960]   His child was born here.
[00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:13.320]   Right.
[00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:16.120]   And then suddenly he vanished back to the Philippines.
[00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:17.440]   Oh, Spike says he's in Manila.
[00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:18.120]   No, he's--
[00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:19.480]   I'm 10 meters from Manila.
[00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:20.080]   No, he's in the Philippines.
[00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:23.080]   Yeah, and what I've heard is that there was some problem
[00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:25.040]   with his wife's visa.
[00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:27.200]   And they haven't got it straightened out yet.
[00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:32.920]   And given what Art Bell used to do on his show,
[00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:36.360]   it does sort of stimulate the paranoid.
[00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:38.320]   And when you think of why are they
[00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:41.280]   hassling him of all the people I can think of?
[00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:42.800]   They roused it Lisa Bettany.
[00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:44.080]   She's been kicked out of the country.
[00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:45.320]   I pour Lisa Bettany.
[00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:47.080]   You all know she's mostly Lisa.
[00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:48.320]   I should read a photo show with her.
[00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:51.160]   She's done really, really well with iPhone apps.
[00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:53.320]   That camera plus app has sold 4 million copies.
[00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:54.200]   Yeah, she's rich now.
[00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:55.680]   She's wealthy.
[00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:58.720]   She's going out with Pete Cashmore Mashable.
[00:38:58.720 --> 00:38:59.680]   Oh, that's too bad.
[00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:01.480]   She was trying to get to--
[00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:04.240]   she was trying to-- she was going to fly to meet him
[00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:07.040]   in the Bahamas for Christmas.
[00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:08.840]   She was coming down from Canada.
[00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:10.840]   The American immigration officials
[00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:13.960]   said you overstayed your visa last time you were here.
[00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:18.200]   Not only can you not come into the country, stay jailed her.
[00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:20.040]   And they deported her out of the US
[00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:20.920]   as she tried to come in.
[00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:22.800]   I think she was trying to come in through Seattle.
[00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:23.680]   And they sent her back.
[00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:25.920]   So she had to go back through Toronto.
[00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:28.080]   She was-- it was like 24 hours of flying.
[00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:30.960]   The poor girl I just felt terrible for.
[00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:32.560]   Anyway, we're going to take a break.
[00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:34.000]   I just love doing the--
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:35.720]   I know where it's a little discursive.
[00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:37.080]   That's OK.
[00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:38.200]   There's not that much tech news.
[00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:39.040]   We're having a great time.
[00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:41.880]   Jerry Pournell is here, one of the greatest science fiction
[00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:42.840]   authors of all time.
[00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:44.480]   And the man who got me in the business,
[00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:47.200]   because his Chaos Manor column in Bite Magazine,
[00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:49.840]   was the first time I'd ever read a computer column that
[00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:52.840]   was written by a user, for users.
[00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:54.240]   It was always user focused.
[00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:56.080]   And that was what really excited me
[00:39:56.080 --> 00:39:57.600]   about doing tech journalism.
[00:39:57.600 --> 00:40:00.400]   So Jerry, I thank you for being here and for inspiring me.
[00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:02.320]   John C. Devorak, the other guy, inspired me.
[00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:04.280]   Your back column in Infoworld Magazine.
[00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:05.080]   My back column?
[00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:05.720]   Back.
[00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:06.080]   Oh, back.
[00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:07.080]   You're on the back page.
[00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:09.080]   I would buy Infoworld just to read the back page.
[00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:10.080]   I wouldn't even read the middle.
[00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:11.600]   I was just telling people, just go to the do stand, read it
[00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:13.080]   there, and shove it back in there.
[00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:15.080]   I do.
[00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:16.800]   It was the best damn column ever.
[00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:18.240]   Was it Inside Track back then?
[00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:19.360]   Or was it--
[00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:21.480]   Inside Track was, yeah, that column was Inside Track.
[00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:22.040]   That was called Inside Track.
[00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:23.480]   It was originally Inside.
[00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:25.160]   When I was the editor, I created this column
[00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:27.040]   and put it inside the magazine.
[00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:29.040]   Because no one-- this column would have never
[00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:31.040]   been printed by any normal editor.
[00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:32.480]   You were the editor, so you printed it.
[00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:32.840]   Yeah.
[00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:33.280]   What the hell?
[00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:33.280]   What?
[00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:33.640]   That.
[00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:34.400]   See, now this is--
[00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:34.840]   So what I do?
[00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:35.400]   There you go.
[00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:36.120]   I'm the editor.
[00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:37.480]   I'm going to do this show.
[00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:39.560]   Dwight Silverman is here from the Houston Chronicle.
[00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:41.200]   We've got a bunch of great writers
[00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:43.800]   who happen to be great talkers on the show today.
[00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:44.920]   Dwight, it's great to have you.
[00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:48.560]   Dwight also does a radio show on Pacifica in Houston
[00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:49.640]   called a bike--
[00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:50.600]   bike computer--
[00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:51.600]   Tech technology bike.
[00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:53.120]   Technology bikes.
[00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:56.000]   Every Wednesday night from 8 o'clock to 10
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:01.760]   central on 9.1 FM or kpft.org if you're on the interwebs.
[00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:05.120]   And you can read them at blog.cron.com/techblog.
[00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:07.040]   Brought to you today by the folks at Citrix,
[00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:09.040]   our good friends at Citrix.
[00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:11.480]   When I say Citrix, I always think of Ed Yacobucci
[00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:15.200]   and those great times at Comdex driving around with Ed.
[00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:17.400]   And Gina Smith, we had a lot of fun.
[00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:19.360]   And then I get excited when I go to Vegas
[00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:20.640]   because I think back to those good times.
[00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:22.880]   Citrix, of course, was started by Ed
[00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:24.520]   because of his intimate knowledge
[00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:26.280]   of the workings of Windows NT.
[00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:28.120]   He was working at IBM, but he helped Microsoft
[00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:29.720]   write the NT kernel.
[00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:32.800]   And he said, I know how to do remote access better than anyone.
[00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:34.400]   And in fact, he was right.
[00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:36.440]   Citrix also makes consumer products
[00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:39.720]   based on the same incredible remote access back in,
[00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:41.120]   like Go to Meeting.
[00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:43.120]   And I've been watching Go to Meeting over the years just
[00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:44.360]   get better and better and better.
[00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:46.560]   Started with screen sharing.
[00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:48.000]   It was a great way to hold a meeting.
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.040]   They made it easier and easier to start meetings right out
[00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:51.920]   of Outlook or your email program.
[00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:54.800]   You just click a button, invite people.
[00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:56.880]   You don't have to have Go to Meeting installed ahead of time.
[00:41:56.880 --> 00:41:59.040]   So it's great for presenting to clients
[00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:00.440]   because all you do is you send them a link.
[00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:01.400]   They click the link.
[00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:03.760]   They say yes when it says you're ready to start the meeting
[00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:06.640]   and the software installs and they're seeing your screen.
[00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:09.760]   But now even better, they're seeing you
[00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:12.680]   Go to Meeting has added HD video conferencing.
[00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:14.680]   They call it HD Faces.
[00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:16.440]   And I'll tell you what,
[00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:18.000]   it's one thing to share screens,
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:19.880]   but when you're seeing high-def video of your client
[00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:23.400]   and they're seeing you, it is such a great way
[00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:26.040]   to communicate, to meet.
[00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:27.320]   You could turn the audio off on this.
[00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:28.600]   I don't care if we hear them,
[00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:31.200]   but this is a demonstration of it.
[00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:33.680]   And literally that's the video, just like that.
[00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:35.880]   You can move the screens around.
[00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:36.920]   It's just remarkable.
[00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:39.000]   If you haven't tried it yet, I want you to visit them.
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:42.360]   Go to Meeting.com and click the Try It Free button.
[00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:45.640]   You can try this for 30 days, absolutely free,
[00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:47.560]   which I think is one of the things we ask
[00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:49.600]   of all of our advertisers.
[00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:51.240]   Go to Meeting, click the Try It Free button.
[00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:54.480]   Use the offer code TWITZ for 30 days, free.
[00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:55.720]   It is a great way to get a sense
[00:42:55.720 --> 00:42:56.720]   of what Go to Meeting can do.
[00:42:56.720 --> 00:42:59.040]   And you gotta check out the HD Faces.
[00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:00.960]   I think that's just transformational.
[00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:04.040]   People spend hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:06.280]   That sounds exaggerated, but it's not.
[00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:09.640]   Tans, anyway, building these conference systems
[00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:11.760]   with telepresence, now it's just, you know,
[00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:13.960]   it's right in there, $49 a month.
[00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:14.920]   As many meetings as you want,
[00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:16.480]   as long as you want, free for the first month.
[00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:18.240]   Go to Meeting.com.
[00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:19.880]   Use the offer code TWITZ.
[00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:20.720]   How do you like my dog?
[00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:22.240]   Have you met Ozzy before, John?
[00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:23.240]   Is that-- - Oh, Boris,
[00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:25.360]   I've kicked her off the chair more than a few times.
[00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:26.200]   (both laugh)
[00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:27.520]   We were playing some Ozzy Osborn,
[00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:29.280]   that's his theme song, you know.
[00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:33.440]   - Yahoo's got a new CEO.
[00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:36.160]   You think this will save Yahoo?
[00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:37.800]   - No. - Get ready for this.
[00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:39.520]   - It may set him up for a buyout though.
[00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:42.600]   This person has a, there's a connection between that person
[00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:45.440]   and somebody who used to be the one of the board members
[00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:47.480]   who was a part of a merger and acquisition deal.
[00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:50.640]   That's why he's brought in to groom the company.
[00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:53.360]   - Who do you think they should merge with?
[00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:55.160]   - Yeah, who's gonna buy that crap?
[00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:57.880]   Baidu, the Chinese, that was one rumor
[00:43:57.880 --> 00:44:00.680]   the Chinese search firm Baidu would buy them.
[00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:01.800]   I think Google should buy them
[00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:03.640]   because Google's getting into the content industry.
[00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:05.440]   - I'm really concerned about--
[00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:06.280]   - That wouldn't happen.
[00:44:06.280 --> 00:44:08.520]   - I mean, about Google getting too big.
[00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:09.360]   - No, that's not gonna happen.
[00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:12.640]   - I don't like companies that are too big to fail.
[00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:14.440]   - Well, I'll tell you about Big Scott Thompson,
[00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:16.160]   the new CEO at Yahoo,
[00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:18.000]   is gonna get a million dollar salary,
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:20.280]   one and a half million dollar cash bonus,
[00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:22.960]   and stock awards worth as much as,
[00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:23.800]   and this is by the way
[00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:26.720]   on the completely devalued Yahoo stock,
[00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:27.920]   22 and a half million,
[00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:31.160]   he's gonna make $27 million in 2012.
[00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:33.400]   Worth it if he sells it, right?
[00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:34.240]   - Probably not.
[00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:35.240]   - No.
[00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:36.080]   - So here's--
[00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:36.920]   - I wouldn't have thought so.
[00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:39.200]   - Here's, let's talk a little bit about this Google thing
[00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:40.040]   'cause we were talking before this show.
[00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:41.600]   - This guy by the way, have you heard him talk?
[00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:42.440]   - No.
[00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:44.440]   See, smart.
[00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:46.560]   - It's got Thompson.
[00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:48.080]   - He's got the, he has one of the deepest--
[00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:49.640]   - He's got a less than accents you've ever given.
[00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:51.480]   - Oh, I love that Boston accent.
[00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:52.640]   - Boston accent.
[00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:54.120]   I love that accent.
[00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:55.320]   People, I miss accents.
[00:44:55.320 --> 00:44:56.240]   People don't have accents in it.
[00:44:56.240 --> 00:44:57.760]   - You have, you can do accents.
[00:44:57.760 --> 00:44:59.160]   - Yeah, I can't do a Boston accent.
[00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:00.000]   I wish I could.
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   It's a great accent.
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:01.840]   - You could work on it.
[00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:02.680]   You could work on it.
[00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:03.520]   - You do it for me.
[00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:05.040]   - You know why I can't do it for Russian?
[00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:05.880]   - You wanna know why I can't?
[00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:06.720]   - Russian I think is the one that's cool.
[00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:08.000]   - I know, you're just, you're egging me on,
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:09.840]   but you know why I can't do the Boston accent
[00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:14.840]   'cause I grew up in Rhode Island and I spent so much time breeding that out of me.
[00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:15.840]   - Oh.
[00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:16.760]   - That it's somehow blocked.
[00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:18.320]   I can't do it.
[00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:20.360]   The Cranston accent is the worst accent.
[00:45:20.360 --> 00:45:21.360]   - Cranston, Rhode Island?
[00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:22.560]   - The Red Island, the worst accent.
[00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:24.360]   - So it's like a squeaky Boston accent?
[00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:25.200]   - It's horrible.
[00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:26.600]   It's Boston accent times two.
[00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:27.840]   - Huh.
[00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:28.840]   That'd be hilarious.
[00:45:28.840 --> 00:45:29.840]   (laughing)
[00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:30.840]   - Yeah, let's hear you.
[00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:32.200]   - I can't.
[00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:33.040]   I have a block.
[00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:35.640]   I was like, oh, whatever you do, if you're gonna be a broadcaster,
[00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:37.160]   you can't talk like that.
[00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:38.680]   - Well, that's bull crap.
[00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:39.680]   You should talk like that.
[00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:40.680]   You do a lot better.
[00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:41.680]   - You would.
[00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:44.680]   Nobody wants to hear a trained voice anymore.
[00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:49.160]   - In Houston, do you hear regional accents still Texas draws?
[00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:54.200]   Texas is big enough that it has its own accents.
[00:45:54.200 --> 00:45:56.880]   People in Houston sound different from people in San Antonio.
[00:45:56.880 --> 00:45:57.880]   - And they got that squeaky Boston.
[00:45:57.880 --> 00:45:58.880]   - And they got that squeaky one.
[00:45:58.880 --> 00:45:59.880]   - That one, that Ross Perot used to have it.
[00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:00.880]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:01.880]   - That one.
[00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:02.880]   - Oh, I hate that.
[00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:04.880]   - That's just, that's just yappy dog accents.
[00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:07.880]   - And then there's a talk about your teeth for a second.
[00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:11.120]   And people pronounce things differently.
[00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:14.000]   You'll hear people in Houston say, "Houston."
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:15.000]   - "Houston."
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.560]   - But people outside of Houston don't say, "Houston."
[00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:18.560]   - "Houston."
[00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:19.560]   - "Houston" or "Houston."
[00:46:19.560 --> 00:46:20.560]   - "Houston."
[00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:21.560]   That's weird.
[00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:23.560]   - They drop the ear and said, "Houston" here.
[00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:24.560]   - "Houston."
[00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:25.560]   - Huh.
[00:46:25.560 --> 00:46:29.480]   - Well, I don't do any Boston accents at all.
[00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:30.480]   - That's a Kennedy accent.
[00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:31.480]   That's kind of Boston.
[00:46:31.480 --> 00:46:32.480]   - I know.
[00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:33.480]   (laughing)
[00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:34.480]   - That's a Chinese.
[00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:35.480]   - Or Mayor Quimby.
[00:46:35.480 --> 00:46:38.200]   - Very, very Quimby talks like that.
[00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:41.240]   No, that's a Brahman accent, it's a Boston Brahman accent,
[00:46:41.240 --> 00:46:45.080]   it's how the people who live up on Beacon Hill talk.
[00:46:45.080 --> 00:46:48.120]   I don't know how Scott talks, so I'm not gonna do a Scott.
[00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:49.960]   - Well, he's from eBay, right?
[00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:51.520]   - Yes, he was president of eBay.
[00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:52.520]   - That's a recommendation.
[00:46:52.520 --> 00:46:53.520]   - No, no, PayPal.
[00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:55.520]   - PayPal, PayPal, PayPal, right.
[00:46:55.520 --> 00:46:56.520]   - PayPal, right, PayPal.
[00:46:56.520 --> 00:47:00.400]   So is there any PayPal is affiliated with who?
[00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:01.400]   Aren't they owned by?
[00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:02.400]   - eBay was.
[00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:03.400]   - eBay.
[00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:05.720]   - So does Meg Whitman figure into any of this?
[00:47:05.720 --> 00:47:07.400]   - Oh, I don't know.
[00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:08.400]   - Seems unlikely.
[00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:09.400]   - Is there any connection, you know?
[00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:10.640]   - Maybe eBay's gonna buy Yahoo.
[00:47:10.640 --> 00:47:12.560]   There you go, there's your connection.
[00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:13.560]   There you nailed it.
[00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:15.720]   - Yahoo is a content company.
[00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:17.680]   They don't own search, Bing does their search.
[00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:18.680]   They do sales.
[00:47:18.680 --> 00:47:22.080]   I think that the closest analog, I don't know if the government would allow--
[00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:23.080]   - Disney.
[00:47:23.080 --> 00:47:24.080]   - Disney.
[00:47:24.080 --> 00:47:25.080]   - No, Google, Google, Disney.
[00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:26.080]   - Disney.
[00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:27.080]   - Yeah.
[00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:28.080]   - Disney, why Yahoo?
[00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:29.080]   - Disney wouldn't, uh...
[00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:32.240]   - Well, they went to Penguin Island or whatever that thing was.
[00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:34.880]   - No, 'cause that way they get the kids into the Disney.
[00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:37.360]   So, I mean, that was a scary purchase.
[00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:40.240]   They bought the most popular kids website.
[00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:41.240]   What was it?
[00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:42.240]   - Penguin Island.
[00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:43.240]   - Penguin, what's it called?
[00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:44.240]   Anyone know?
[00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:45.240]   Penguin Island.
[00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:46.240]   - Chatroom.
[00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:47.240]   - Chatroom, Penguin, Penguin, Disney, Penguin.
[00:47:47.240 --> 00:47:49.240]   - ABC's owned by Disney, that's right.
[00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:50.240]   - Right.
[00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:51.240]   - Club Penguin.
[00:47:51.240 --> 00:47:53.240]   - Club Penguin, there it is.
[00:47:53.240 --> 00:47:55.480]   - And Fowler gets the prize there.
[00:47:55.480 --> 00:47:56.680]   Thank you, Fowler.
[00:47:56.680 --> 00:48:01.720]   So Club Penguin was bought by Disney in the most, to me this is sleazy 'cause you, what
[00:48:01.720 --> 00:48:05.840]   you do is you get kids channeled into the Disney environment and then they never leave,
[00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:06.840]   right?
[00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:07.840]   - Right, and then you go to the Club Penguin.
[00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:09.840]   - And we get all their personal information.
[00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:10.840]   - Oh, yeah.

[00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:11.080]   - Right, we actually sit on their bandwidth because that's how we stream from shows like
[00:49:11.080 --> 00:49:13.080]   showstoppers.
[00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:21.600]   Verizon, you may remember last year, did a CEO address, I mean a CES address, the CEO

[00:49:34.480 --> 00:49:38.240]   - He's canceled at the very last minute, canceled his appearance this year.
[00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:44.560]   A couple of days before Lowell McAdam said, on Tuesday, this past Tuesday, he said, "Oh,
[00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:47.240]   my schedule will prevent me from speaking after all."
[00:49:47.240 --> 00:49:49.920]   - What do you think that's all about?
[00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:51.440]   - That's bizarre, like, "Oh, I didn't know.
[00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:52.800]   I should have checked my calendar."
[00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:54.360]   Ah, oh, I'm sorry.
[00:49:54.360 --> 00:49:55.480]   I've got a dentist appointment.
[00:49:55.480 --> 00:49:56.480]   I can't--

[00:49:57.480 --> 00:50:03.800]   - Actually, he was part of a CEO roundtable with somebody from Xerox and Ford, I believe.
[00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:08.760]   It wasn't just him by himself, and I wonder if maybe he wasn't miffed that he wasn't going
[00:50:08.760 --> 00:50:09.760]   to get the spotlight himself.
[00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:12.600]   But it had been set up as a roundtable for a while.

[00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:19.240]   We are going to, I'm going to get a chance to interview him on Tuesday for 20 minutes,
[00:50:19.240 --> 00:50:20.960]   and then I'm having dinner with him that night.
[00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:21.960]   - Whee!
[00:50:21.960 --> 00:50:22.960]   - Can I borrow that sweater?
[00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:24.440]   Because it's exactly what he likes to wear.
[00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:26.240]   Just like that, the scene is.
[00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:28.920]   When I interviewed him two years ago, I put on a suit.
[00:50:28.920 --> 00:50:29.920]   - I thought that can color.
[00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:32.320]   - CEO of Ford, I'm going to wear a suit.
[00:50:32.320 --> 00:50:33.640]   And he comes, he looks like Pat Boone.
[00:50:33.640 --> 00:50:34.640]   He's got like a V-neck, and he's like--
[00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:35.640]   - He's just singing?
[00:50:35.640 --> 00:50:36.640]   - He came from tennis.
[00:50:36.640 --> 00:50:37.640]   It was like--
[00:50:37.640 --> 00:50:38.640]   - Right, tennis.
[00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:41.320]   - And I said, "Ah, I guess I'm a little overdressed."
[00:50:41.320 --> 00:50:43.480]   So this time, of course, he'll be wearing black tie.
[00:50:43.480 --> 00:50:45.040]   - Yeah, and you'll be dressed like a bum.
[00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:46.040]   - Yeah, that's probably true.
[00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:47.040]   It's not a bad guy.
[00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:51.080]   - Nobody ever got thrown out of any place for wearing a dark suit.
[00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:52.760]   - Now, we're at Tux.
[00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:53.760]   That's the age I think.
[00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:54.760]   - No, that's a little--
[00:50:54.760 --> 00:50:55.760]   - The massive wisdom speaking.
[00:50:55.760 --> 00:50:58.800]   - In Vegas, I guarantee you can wear a tux anywhere.
[00:50:58.800 --> 00:50:59.800]   We use it--
[00:50:59.800 --> 00:51:02.120]   - And they'll say, "Park my car, boy."
[00:51:02.120 --> 00:51:05.120]   - Good guys that park cars do not wear tuxes.
[00:51:05.120 --> 00:51:06.760]   - I'm going to wear a suit the whole time.
[00:51:06.760 --> 00:51:08.280]   - Wear a tux the whole time.
[00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:09.280]   You're a Leo LaPorche.
[00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:10.280]   - I should have.
[00:51:10.280 --> 00:51:11.280]   - For God's sake.
[00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:12.280]   - Wouldn't that be good if I just wore a tux?
[00:51:12.280 --> 00:51:13.280]   They think I was James Bond.
[00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:15.280]   - I was having more titty glass.
[00:51:15.280 --> 00:51:16.280]   - James Bond.
[00:51:16.280 --> 00:51:17.440]   - Martini glass with you all the time.
[00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:18.440]   - I used to be James.
[00:51:18.440 --> 00:51:19.440]   Do you know who I am?
[00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:20.440]   I used to be James Bond.
[00:51:20.440 --> 00:51:21.440]   - Leo LaPorche.
[00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:24.720]   - I want to try to get my my mock training.
[00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:27.400]   - Capital L, small A.
[00:51:27.400 --> 00:51:29.400]   (laughing)
[00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:33.640]   - I'm going to wear-- you can't wear a tux anymore because you look just like a waiter.
[00:51:33.640 --> 00:51:34.640]   They've ruined it.
[00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:37.640]   They've ruined it for us.
[00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:38.640]   Dressy people.
[00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:39.640]   - Yep.
[00:51:39.640 --> 00:51:40.640]   There's a father--
[00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:41.640]   - You can pull it off.
[00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:42.640]   I'm telling you.
[00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:43.640]   - What is that, Jerry?
[00:51:43.640 --> 00:51:51.920]   - There's a father-brown story about why a certain gentleman's club now wears green tuxedos.
[00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:52.920]   - Aha.
[00:51:52.920 --> 00:51:53.920]   There you go.
[00:51:53.920 --> 00:51:54.920]   - Green tuxedos.
[00:51:54.920 --> 00:51:55.920]   - He looked like a giant leprechaun.
[00:51:55.920 --> 00:51:59.520]   - So that they would not be mistaken for a waiter.
[00:51:59.520 --> 00:52:06.440]   - Just when you thought we'd settled on compact flash and SD cards, Sony's back with a new
[00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:08.800]   memory card format.
[00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:10.040]   - Memory Stick 5?
[00:52:10.040 --> 00:52:11.040]   - Yeah.
[00:52:11.040 --> 00:52:12.040]   It's called XQD.
[00:52:12.040 --> 00:52:13.040]   - Yeah.
[00:52:13.040 --> 00:52:14.040]   - They-- you know, they--
[00:52:14.040 --> 00:52:15.600]   - What is wrong with these people?
[00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:16.600]   - That's Sony.
[00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:22.240]   - Well, apparently the new Nikon D4 camera that everybody's raving about this brand new--
[00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:23.720]   - You're going to use this stick?
[00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:24.720]   - It uses XQD.
[00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:25.720]   - No.
[00:52:25.720 --> 00:52:26.720]   - It uses XQD.
[00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:27.720]   - That's a blender.
[00:52:27.720 --> 00:52:33.720]   - Well, it also-- I think it uses both XQD and compact flash so you could have two in
[00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:34.720]   there.
[00:52:34.720 --> 00:52:35.720]   - But the big old flash card in there is not--
[00:52:35.720 --> 00:52:42.120]   - Well, these-- okay, one reason they like XQD, it goes to two terabytes, which is a terrible
[00:52:42.120 --> 00:52:43.120]   idea.
[00:52:43.120 --> 00:52:45.040]   You don't want two terabytes of pictures on a card.
[00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:47.560]   - I took pictures all year and they're all in this card.
[00:52:47.560 --> 00:52:48.560]   - There's a full frame camera, probably--
[00:52:48.560 --> 00:52:49.560]   - It is.
[00:52:49.560 --> 00:52:51.560]   - Choose up 32 megs on each shot.
[00:52:51.560 --> 00:52:52.560]   - Probably 40.
[00:52:52.560 --> 00:52:54.560]   - I would say more like 40 megs of shot, but still--
[00:52:54.560 --> 00:52:55.560]   - Boom, boom, boom.
[00:52:55.560 --> 00:52:56.920]   - Do the math chat room.
[00:52:56.920 --> 00:52:59.720]   See, Jerry, you have your smartphone, I got the chat room.
[00:52:59.720 --> 00:53:02.200]   - Chat room, the chat room knows all.
[00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:03.200]   - If you have a four-- if--
[00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:04.200]   - And he says--
[00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:05.200]   - If 4K picks--
[00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:12.200]   - If Jerry has a two terabyte memory card and is using an Nikon D4 camera with 40 megapixel
[00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:17.560]   shots, how many megapixel shots can Jerry take before he has to change his card?
[00:53:17.560 --> 00:53:23.920]   - They're talking about-- this is where we went wrong.
[00:53:23.920 --> 00:53:25.680]   They're talking about something completely different now.
[00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:26.680]   They're not even doing attention.
[00:53:26.680 --> 00:53:27.680]   - They're so--
[00:53:27.680 --> 00:53:28.680]   - They've moved on.
[00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:29.680]   - They've moved on.
[00:53:29.680 --> 00:53:30.680]   - There it is.
[00:53:30.680 --> 00:53:31.680]   A lot, 24, 5,000--
[00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:32.680]   - Scrolled off.
[00:53:32.680 --> 00:53:33.680]   - 4,000--
[00:53:33.680 --> 00:53:34.680]   - All right, Fobotino says about--
[00:53:34.680 --> 00:53:35.680]   - Squirrel.
[00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:36.680]   - Squirrel, 50,000.
[00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:37.680]   - Squirrel.
[00:53:37.680 --> 00:53:45.320]   - It's somewhere between 50 and a million, I think, the chips.
[00:53:45.320 --> 00:53:47.480]   See, sometimes your brain doesn't work so well.
[00:53:47.480 --> 00:53:48.480]   - That's okay.
[00:53:48.480 --> 00:53:52.440]   - But this card is not compatible with any other card.
[00:53:52.440 --> 00:53:55.240]   It's actually a little bit slower than the top of the line compact flashcards.
[00:53:55.240 --> 00:53:56.240]   - That's nice.
[00:53:56.240 --> 00:53:57.240]   - You want something fast?
[00:53:57.240 --> 00:53:58.240]   - What is going on?
[00:53:58.240 --> 00:53:59.240]   I wish Sony would--
[00:53:59.240 --> 00:54:01.000]   - Especially with the size of those images, it takes forever to load that card.
[00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:04.840]   - Are you still shooting with the Olympus P-- Pen, the P3?
[00:54:04.840 --> 00:54:06.320]   - P3, yeah, it's in the card.
[00:54:06.320 --> 00:54:07.320]   - It's a great camera.
[00:54:07.320 --> 00:54:08.320]   - I like it.
[00:54:08.320 --> 00:54:09.320]   - Do you love it?
[00:54:09.320 --> 00:54:14.120]   - Well, I would like it more if I, you know, in some circumstance, but I like it.
[00:54:14.120 --> 00:54:16.080]   - Yeah.
[00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:20.840]   - Do you think Apple Television is real and will it be the talk of CES discuss?
[00:54:20.840 --> 00:54:21.840]   - What?
[00:54:21.840 --> 00:54:24.440]   - I don't know, it's an essay question.
[00:54:24.440 --> 00:54:26.560]   - It will be the talk of CES.
[00:54:26.560 --> 00:54:27.560]   - Probably is real.
[00:54:27.560 --> 00:54:28.560]   - No way.
[00:54:28.560 --> 00:54:29.560]   - Probably is real, but it will be the talk.
[00:54:29.560 --> 00:54:31.560]   - I don't think so.
[00:54:31.560 --> 00:54:35.720]   - Every year, Apple, even though it's not there, everybody talks about it.
[00:54:35.720 --> 00:54:37.400]   - They don't have to do anything.
[00:54:37.400 --> 00:54:39.160]   - They don't have to talk to CES.
[00:54:39.160 --> 00:54:40.800]   - Isn't it amazing?
[00:54:40.800 --> 00:54:42.800]   - Last year, okay, so I remember when the--
[00:54:42.800 --> 00:54:46.000]   - Last year was the iPad 2 because everybody knew the iPad 2 was coming.
[00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:48.160]   The year before it was the iPad 1, right?
[00:54:48.160 --> 00:54:50.960]   As I already knew that was coming.
[00:54:50.960 --> 00:54:57.920]   And now it's this Apple TV that because of the Steve Jobs biography, he says, "I cracked
[00:54:57.920 --> 00:55:00.600]   the interface for television."
[00:55:00.600 --> 00:55:04.120]   Somebody asked Waz that it'll be, that it's imminent.
[00:55:04.120 --> 00:55:08.160]   Somebody asked Waz, I think it was USA Today, and Waz said, "I do expect Apple to make an
[00:55:08.160 --> 00:55:12.000]   attempt since I expect the living room to remain a center for family entertainment."
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:15.240]   And that touches on all areas of consumer products that Apple's already making.
[00:55:15.240 --> 00:55:19.480]   I guess that's the strategy is we're in the office, we're in the living room, we're in
[00:55:19.480 --> 00:55:22.280]   your pocket, and we want to be in the bedroom.
[00:55:22.280 --> 00:55:23.280]   - We want to be in the bedroom.
[00:55:23.280 --> 00:55:24.280]   - We want to be in the bedroom.
[00:55:24.280 --> 00:55:25.280]   - We want to be all screens.
[00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:26.280]   - All screens to all people.
[00:55:26.280 --> 00:55:28.600]   - Let's start a new rumor.
[00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:29.880]   An Apple product for the bedroom.
[00:55:29.880 --> 00:55:30.880]   John, what do you think?
[00:55:30.880 --> 00:55:31.880]   - Dildo.
[00:55:31.880 --> 00:55:32.880]   (laughter)
[00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:33.880]   - Oh, man.
[00:55:33.880 --> 00:55:34.880]   - I knew it.
[00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:36.880]   - I said it, he would say.
[00:55:36.880 --> 00:55:37.880]   - I would have to say it.
[00:55:37.880 --> 00:55:38.880]   - I dildo.
[00:55:38.880 --> 00:55:39.880]   - The eye dildo.
[00:55:39.880 --> 00:55:40.880]   - Remote control.
[00:55:40.880 --> 00:55:43.160]   - I'll be right there, honey.
[00:55:43.160 --> 00:55:44.560]   - And so when Steve says he's lifted--
[00:55:44.560 --> 00:55:45.560]   - Never mind.
[00:55:45.560 --> 00:55:46.560]   - Never mind.
[00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:47.560]   - Now see, now you're getting--
[00:55:47.560 --> 00:55:48.560]   - I'm actually--
[00:55:48.560 --> 00:55:51.120]   - I'm funny on a cerebral level.
[00:55:51.120 --> 00:55:52.120]   - That wasn't cerebral.
[00:55:52.120 --> 00:55:54.120]   - It was nothing cerebral about that at all.
[00:55:54.120 --> 00:55:55.120]   - Just dirty in the gutter.
[00:55:55.120 --> 00:55:56.120]   (laughter)
[00:55:56.120 --> 00:55:57.920]   - I'm so sorry.
[00:55:57.920 --> 00:55:58.920]   Let's move on.
[00:55:58.920 --> 00:56:07.040]   - I will say I have quite a few readers who are enthusiastically looking forward to the
[00:56:07.040 --> 00:56:08.040]   Apple TV.
[00:56:08.040 --> 00:56:09.640]   - More than a few people.
[00:56:09.640 --> 00:56:12.960]   - I'm a Apple enthusiast who are my subscribers.
[00:56:12.960 --> 00:56:13.960]   - Of course.
[00:56:13.960 --> 00:56:19.560]   - But I don't understand what Apple could do to a TV that would make it more desirable
[00:56:19.560 --> 00:56:21.040]   than a Samsung.
[00:56:21.040 --> 00:56:22.440]   - But they're label on it.
[00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:23.440]   - That's it.
[00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:24.440]   - Yeah.
[00:56:24.440 --> 00:56:25.440]   - You think that's it, Jerry?
[00:56:25.440 --> 00:56:29.880]   - I'll expect they'll put built in digital recording, among other things.
[00:56:29.880 --> 00:56:30.880]   - The DVR.
[00:56:30.880 --> 00:56:32.240]   - Something of that sort.
[00:56:32.240 --> 00:56:34.640]   - And Siri or some sort of voice control, right?
[00:56:34.640 --> 00:56:36.480]   - Yeah, it'll be just--
[00:56:36.480 --> 00:56:42.120]   - She's very nice and functional junk that will probably last a year or two and you have
[00:56:42.120 --> 00:56:48.040]   to buy another one and there'll be the Apple TV 2 and the 2A and the 2S and the 4.
[00:56:48.040 --> 00:56:49.760]   - So it's a profit deal.
[00:56:49.760 --> 00:56:51.640]   - That's what the company does, their money makers.
[00:56:51.640 --> 00:56:54.680]   - Apple's never been anything but a profit deal.
[00:56:54.680 --> 00:56:55.680]   Come on, they have always--
[00:56:55.680 --> 00:56:57.200]   - No, don't say that.
[00:56:57.200 --> 00:57:05.720]   - The interesting thing is they have managed to survive when they went for profit rather
[00:57:05.720 --> 00:57:12.040]   than market share, which strategy was what took them to the point where in 1996 they
[00:57:12.040 --> 00:57:18.440]   were about down the tube and Jobs figured out a way to make that profitable after all.
[00:57:18.440 --> 00:57:21.400]   - You know what I would like to see and I do think this is the future of television
[00:57:21.400 --> 00:57:23.120]   in some respects is apps.
[00:57:23.120 --> 00:57:25.800]   I think Google TV is moving in that direction.
[00:57:25.800 --> 00:57:31.320]   Well, for instance, okay, so somebody called the radio show today and said, "Is the Superbowl
[00:57:31.320 --> 00:57:32.320]   on the Internet?
[00:57:32.320 --> 00:57:33.960]   I won't be at home.
[00:57:33.960 --> 00:57:35.240]   Can I watch the Superbowl on the Internet?"
[00:57:35.240 --> 00:57:38.880]   I did a search and yes indeed, if you're a Verizon customer.
[00:57:38.880 --> 00:57:39.880]   - Only.
[00:57:39.880 --> 00:57:44.040]   - Well, what about Comcast when you have that Comcastic thing, whatever it is they have?
[00:57:44.040 --> 00:57:45.040]   What's it called?
[00:57:45.040 --> 00:57:46.040]   - Xfinity or--
[00:57:46.040 --> 00:57:47.040]   - Xfinity, well no.
[00:57:47.040 --> 00:57:48.040]   So here's the deal.
[00:57:48.040 --> 00:57:51.480]   If you want to watch it on your smartphone, you have to have a Verizon smartphone.
[00:57:51.480 --> 00:57:55.560]   If you want to watch it on your computer, you can watch it on NBC or NFL's website.
[00:57:55.560 --> 00:57:59.360]   So yes, the Superbowl will be streamed on the Internet.
[00:57:59.360 --> 00:58:01.760]   But I'm thinking if I'm the NFL, what do I really want?
[00:58:01.760 --> 00:58:04.480]   I want to disintermediate all the-- I don't want NBC.
[00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:05.480]   I don't want Comcast.
[00:58:05.480 --> 00:58:06.600]   I don't want Verizon.
[00:58:06.600 --> 00:58:11.080]   I want to make an NFL app that you pay $39.95 a year for.
[00:58:11.080 --> 00:58:12.800]   Major League Baseball is already doing this.
[00:58:12.800 --> 00:58:13.800]   - Yes.
[00:58:13.800 --> 00:58:16.720]   - And that's where you watch it.
[00:58:16.720 --> 00:58:17.960]   And then I get all the revenue.
[00:58:17.960 --> 00:58:20.040]   - You wrote on the iPad too, I suppose.
[00:58:20.040 --> 00:58:21.560]   - Well, that's the point.
[00:58:21.560 --> 00:58:23.360]   - Well, it could be on Apple TV or--
[00:58:23.360 --> 00:58:29.920]   - I will bet you that the Apple TV will listen to and cooperate with the iPad.
[00:58:29.920 --> 00:58:30.920]   - Oh, absolutely.
[00:58:30.920 --> 00:58:31.920]   The iPad's a great control.
[00:58:31.920 --> 00:58:32.920]   - Yeah, it'll be the controller.
[00:58:32.920 --> 00:58:33.920]   - It'll be the controller.
[00:58:33.920 --> 00:58:35.720]   - Or just the iPhone.
[00:58:35.720 --> 00:58:39.200]   - Well, in fact, of course, if you're going to have an Apple TV, you'll have to have every
[00:58:39.200 --> 00:58:41.200]   other Apple product or a lot of them.
[00:58:41.200 --> 00:58:45.360]   - The Apple fanboys are hankering for this stuff.
[00:58:45.360 --> 00:58:47.360]   - They're hankering for it.
[00:58:47.360 --> 00:58:49.000]   - You can order it again.
[00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:56.240]   - If you have a Samsung TV set, there's an iOS app that lets you control your TV set,
[00:58:56.240 --> 00:58:59.040]   your Samsung TV, I have one, from your iPhone.
[00:58:59.040 --> 00:59:00.600]   And it'd be easy for Apple to do it.
[00:59:00.600 --> 00:59:03.200]   If you have an iPhone 4S, you control it with Siri.
[00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:08.680]   You might even talk to the phone instead of to the TV, because then it can control how
[00:59:08.680 --> 00:59:11.360]   it's a better quality for listening to your voice.
[00:59:11.360 --> 00:59:16.360]   - But can you make a TV that requires you to also own a smartphone?
[00:59:16.360 --> 00:59:17.920]   - Well, that's our smartphone.
[00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:21.120]   - I don't think, you know, the rim tried to do something similar, making--
[00:59:21.120 --> 00:59:22.120]   - That's right.
[00:59:22.120 --> 00:59:23.960]   The playbook didn't have email unless you had a blackberry.
[00:59:23.960 --> 00:59:25.880]   - It won't require it.
[00:59:25.880 --> 00:59:29.440]   It just will make it life easier if you have one.
[00:59:29.440 --> 00:59:30.440]   - Right, exactly.
[00:59:30.440 --> 00:59:32.680]   - What do we do about-- - By the way, what should I phone out
[00:59:32.680 --> 00:59:34.280]   to go down and buy?
[00:59:34.280 --> 00:59:35.280]   - Get the new one.
[00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:36.280]   4S.
[00:59:36.280 --> 00:59:37.280]   - Yeah.
[00:59:37.280 --> 00:59:38.280]   - Definitely the 4S.
[00:59:38.280 --> 00:59:39.280]   - Just for the camera.
[00:59:39.280 --> 00:59:40.280]   - The camera is really good.
[00:59:40.280 --> 00:59:41.280]   In fact, that's funny.
[00:59:41.280 --> 00:59:44.680]   I've stopped carrying all my pro cameras around because I got the iPhone 4S as well.
[00:59:44.680 --> 00:59:46.400]   - Let me tell you something about that camera.
[00:59:46.400 --> 00:59:51.240]   A lot of people have overlooked the fact it is one of the best scanners I have ever seen.
[00:59:51.240 --> 00:59:52.240]   - It's a rough resolution.
[00:59:52.240 --> 00:59:55.280]   - You take a shot of text, like a newspaper.
[00:59:55.280 --> 00:59:57.720]   It's unbelievable.
[00:59:57.720 --> 01:00:00.120]   - Is there a good OCR for it?
[01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:02.360]   - There are a couple of apps that you can get.
[01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:04.760]   There's a, there's a, there's a, what's it called?
[01:00:04.760 --> 01:00:07.680]   Jotknot Pro is a good one.
[01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:09.680]   There are a couple of apps you can get that have OCR.
[01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:13.960]   They will also treat it as a scanner so you can do things like turn it into a PDF and
[01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:14.960]   then email it.
[01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:16.880]   I mean, it's really, it's very sophisticated.
[01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:17.880]   It's really good.
[01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:19.840]   - Back to course, bank deposits are not sort of--
[01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:20.840]   - I love that.
[01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:22.320]   There are a number of banks now.
[01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:25.120]   USAA, I think, started this where you take a picture of the check.
[01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:26.120]   - I don't like that idea.
[01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:27.120]   - Why don't you like?
[01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:28.120]   I just don't like it.
[01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:29.120]   - That's all they do.
[01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:30.120]   You know that, right?
[01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:34.600]   - Now, nowadays, when I put a check in the Bank of America ATM machine, all it does is
[01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:36.600]   scan it and throw the check out.
[01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:37.600]   - Yep.
[01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:38.960]   - They don't need the check.
[01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:41.520]   They just need the routing number.
[01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:42.520]   What are you looking at me like that for?
[01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:45.560]   - I just don't like these banks.
[01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:49.120]   - I'm old school, man.
[01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:50.120]   - My son, 17.
[01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:51.120]   - Who's 17 now?
[01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:53.840]   - My son, who's 17, came up to me and said, "I just saw a movie.
[01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:54.840]   You've got to see this."
[01:00:54.840 --> 01:00:55.840]   I said, "What is it?"
[01:00:55.840 --> 01:00:56.840]   He says, "It's called Thrive.
[01:00:56.840 --> 01:00:59.040]   Did you know that there's three banks that control the world?"
[01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:01.160]   I said, "Oh, no, no, no."
[01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:04.720]   I said, "I said, it's very believable."
[01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:06.640]   I said, "All conspiracy theories."
[01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:08.960]   - He should be a no agenda listener.
[01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:12.280]   - He listened to George Norey every night.
[01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:16.960]   I basically said that was, that basically comes from the foundation of anti-Semitism,
[01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:19.880]   the world Jewish conspiracy, and it's, "B-S!
[01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:20.880]   Don't believe it."
[01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:21.880]   I said, "No, but it's a great movie.
[01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:22.880]   You've got to watch it tonight."
[01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:23.880]   - I said, "Oh, dear."
[01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:25.680]   - Yeah, that's what happens.
[01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:28.360]   We don't like that idea.
[01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:29.360]   We don't like that.
[01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:30.880]   You don't espouse that of no agenda.
[01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:31.880]   - No, it's not.
[01:01:31.880 --> 01:01:32.880]   - The Ross Charles, all of that.
[01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:33.880]   - Oh, crap.
[01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:34.880]   - Of course it is.
[01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:35.880]   - The Goldman Sachs, though.
[01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:37.680]   No, you're talking.
[01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:43.360]   So, going back to this TV thing, what is, and we should be talking about this, what
[01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:44.840]   is Google TV up to?
[01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:47.000]   They're going to make a, they're going to swing it.
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:48.000]   - They're swinging it.
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.000]   - They're swinging it.
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.120]   Remember Eric Schmidt said it, "Lewebb," and everybody was shocked.
[01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:55.320]   More than half of all TVs sold in 2012 will have Google TV, and everybody said, "What
[01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:56.880]   are you talking about?"
[01:01:56.880 --> 01:02:00.600]   Logitech already said it was a $100 million blunder for us.
[01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:04.080]   I happen to have the Logitech review, which is a Google TV.
[01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:07.640]   They recently updated the firmware, and I love it, and I think apps, it's already got
[01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:08.640]   some apps.
[01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:09.640]   It needs more apps.
[01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:10.640]   - What's better about it?
[01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:15.320]   - Well, for one thing, it's not like a Roku box where it's another HDMI input.
[01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:18.800]   You know, you spend all this time on your remote setting, which one is it?
[01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:21.080]   It's a pass-through, so your cable box goes into it.
[01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:25.560]   So it's an overlay on top of your TV, which means you'll overlay a browser, you'll overlay
[01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:30.040]   a Twitter, you can pull up a menu, you can go to Netflix, but you never leave that HDMI,
[01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:33.040]   that single HDMI, which means it also would build into a TV.
[01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:35.560]   - Okay, so they're gonna start putting it in TVs?
[01:02:35.560 --> 01:02:36.560]   Do we have any TVs yet?
[01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:37.560]   - Well, Sony did.
[01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:39.440]   They put it in their Blu-rays.
[01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:43.880]   I suspect that the reason Eric, I'm sure there's something Eric was thinking about.
[01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:48.040]   Remember, they just bought Motorola, which is big manufacturer's set-top boxes, one
[01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:49.520]   of the two big set-top box manufacturers.
[01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:51.320]   - Although they bought Motorola Mobility.
[01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:53.160]   - Yeah, they didn't buy the set-top box division.
[01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:55.360]   - No, no, that's the set-top box division as part of mobility.
[01:02:55.360 --> 01:02:56.360]   - Oh, really?
[01:02:56.360 --> 01:02:57.360]   - Yeah.
[01:02:57.360 --> 01:02:58.360]   - Okay, we'll go on.
[01:02:58.360 --> 01:03:01.240]   - So I have a feeling you're gonna start seeing Google TV in more places than you might
[01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:03.400]   have imagined, including set-top boxes.
[01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:05.240]   - So what about the Logitech devices?
[01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:06.240]   That dead in the water they just make it up?
[01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:07.240]   - Yeah, Logitech said we--
[01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:09.240]   - So they bail out when you think you're just getting the go?
[01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:13.880]   - Logitech said, "Oh, man, $100 million down the tube."
[01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:18.240]   I think they got out too soon, but I do think that regardless if it's Apple or Google or
[01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:21.480]   whoever else that apps are the future of TVs.
[01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:23.320]   - So what kind of apps are we talking about?
[01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:26.160]   - I think an HBO app?
[01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:27.160]   - What is--
[01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:30.360]   - So why don't I just turn it on HBO on the Dish Network?
[01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:34.280]   - Because HBO has to give a chunk of change to Dish for that access.
[01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:38.560]   Instead of that, HBO goes direct to you.
[01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:39.720]   - Can I buy by the hour?
[01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:41.160]   Like you can't with a big dish?
[01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:42.160]   - Possibly, I don't know.
[01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:45.160]   I mean, what kind of services would you like?
[01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:47.480]   The point is because it's their app, they can decide.
[01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:50.040]   And if suddenly they say, "Hey, you know, market research says there's a lot of people
[01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:53.080]   want to buy by the hour, all they have to do is flip a switch."
[01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:55.240]   Because they control the channel.
[01:03:55.240 --> 01:04:01.920]   And Leo, for years, what consumer advocates have wanted is the ability to buy cable television
[01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:04.240]   channels on the cards.
[01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:08.440]   And this is what-- this, I think, is the key to what Apple wants to do is they want to
[01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:14.040]   say, "Here's your-- you want a CBS app, you want a Fox app, you want NBC, and then you
[01:04:14.040 --> 01:04:15.040]   want HBO--"
[01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:16.040]   - Better than that.
[01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:17.040]   - What about this?
[01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:18.040]   - What about this twig?
[01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:19.040]   - Yeah.
[01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:20.040]   - I don't even want-- I don't even want the CBS app.
[01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:22.520]   I just want the Walking Dead app.
[01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:24.000]   - I don't even want a network.
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:25.000]   I want a show.
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:26.000]   - Right.
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.200]   - What if I bought the show app?
[01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:30.480]   - I think that's exactly what Apple has in mind.
[01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:31.480]   - Do consumers want that?
[01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:32.960]   - Of course they do.
[01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:33.960]   - Yes.
[01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:35.680]   - They've been getting ripped off all these years.
[01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:40.640]   You take this huge package, $120 a month for some package, and then if you go over what
[01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:45.080]   you did over the month, you watch some network TV, maybe one movie, and then you have the
[01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:47.160]   stars thing and you never saw one star's movie.
[01:04:47.160 --> 01:04:48.880]   It's just a complete waste of money.
[01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:52.200]   - You know, it's interesting because that is exactly what Apple did to the music industry.
[01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:55.680]   The music industry was based on selling a full CD of crap.
[01:04:55.680 --> 01:04:56.680]   - A crap?
[01:04:56.680 --> 01:04:57.680]   One good song, 11 copies.
[01:04:57.680 --> 01:05:02.000]   - And Steve Jobs went to the music company and he said, "99 cents a song."
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:03.160]   And he said, "No way."
[01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:04.160]   He said, "You know what?
[01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:05.360]   You're getting killed by piracy.
[01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:07.280]   99 cents a song."
[01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:09.080]   And they did it.
[01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:11.440]   What's going to be the motivator to get these content companies?
[01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:12.440]   - They don't have.
[01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:13.600]   They're not being killed by piracy.
[01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:14.920]   - They're not, are they?
[01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:15.920]   - No.
[01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:16.920]   - It's going to be hard to do that.
[01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:18.360]   - It's going to be killed by piracy.
[01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:25.040]   And it's astonishing because the pirates are there.
[01:05:25.040 --> 01:05:26.040]   - They only want to music.
[01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:30.760]   - People are buying books, now they think it's partly price.
[01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:33.200]   - The key is twofold.
[01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:35.720]   Point of access, it has to be easy, right?
[01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:38.800]   Piracy thrived when you couldn't get this stuff.
[01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:42.440]   And that's by the way, the problem right now with television and cable is if you're
[01:05:42.440 --> 01:05:45.320]   not the right subscriber to the right thing, you can't get it.
[01:05:45.320 --> 01:05:48.760]   That's why piracy will thrive in a broadband world.
[01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:54.000]   But if it's easy to get and the price is affordable, I think people want to support
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:55.000]   you, Jerry.
[01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:56.840]   I think people want to support John C. DeVorque.
[01:05:56.840 --> 01:05:57.840]   They want to support--
[01:05:57.840 --> 01:05:59.280]   - That was no question about it.
[01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:03.600]   My website is totally voluntary subscription.
[01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:05.440]   It's a public radio model.
[01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:06.440]   And it works.
[01:06:06.440 --> 01:06:07.920]   It works very well.
[01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:11.360]   - Nevertheless, I don't think it's going to be an easy road to hope.
[01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:14.560]   Our chatroom is Ken from Chicago, the chatroom is saying the second most underrated text
[01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:21.440]   story of 2011, old media and cable in a fight to the finish.
[01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:25.280]   Cable companies are going to threaten immediate loss in revenue of studios and content providers
[01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:27.600]   are going to sell directly online.
[01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:29.480]   I do think that you're going to see it.
[01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:32.280]   And that's what Soap and Pippa are about.
[01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:34.680]   I don't think it's about protecting authors like Jerry.
[01:06:34.680 --> 01:06:38.080]   I think it's about content companies saying we've got to control the channel.
[01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:40.480]   - Well, that's the irony of this whole thing that Jerry and I--
[01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:42.040]   - But you guys are doing fine.
[01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:46.760]   - No, it's not that no, I'm saying, but people don't know about writing and artists of all
[01:06:46.760 --> 01:06:47.760]   sorts.
[01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:51.160]   Generally speaking, they don't own their own copyrights anymore.
[01:06:51.160 --> 01:06:54.000]   These publishers make you-- they put a demand on you.
[01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:55.000]   - I'll kill you.
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.160]   - And they say, you have to give us all the copyrights and here's what you're going to
[01:06:57.160 --> 01:06:58.160]   get paid.
[01:06:58.160 --> 01:07:01.400]   And the next-- so who's this protecting?
[01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:02.760]   Giant content holders.
[01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:05.400]   And these guys never even do anything with this stuff.
[01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:06.680]   They just sit on it.
[01:07:06.680 --> 01:07:07.680]   - So the Louis C.K.
[01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:10.080]   experiment, you think, is a harbinger of the future.
[01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:15.040]   This guy said, I'm not going to make this next cable comedy special for the comedy
[01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:16.840]   centrels or the HBOs.
[01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:18.280]   I'm going to do it myself.
[01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:19.440]   I'm going to put my own money.
[01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:20.440]   Now he had capital.
[01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:22.080]   He said he put almost a million dollars into it.
[01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:23.080]   - He's got a huge following.
[01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:24.080]   - But he's got a huge following.
[01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:27.560]   He sold it for $5 without copy protection on his website that last time I saw it was
[01:07:27.560 --> 01:07:28.720]   over a million dollars.
[01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:30.720]   He's donating to the charities.
[01:07:30.720 --> 01:07:35.280]   He's letting the community choose the charities that he gives a portion of these proceeds
[01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:36.280]   to.
[01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:38.280]   He's making so much money on it.
[01:07:38.280 --> 01:07:39.280]   Is that a harbinger?
[01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:41.600]   Or can only Louis C.K. do that?
[01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:43.560]   - Only people like Louis C.K. can do that.
[01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:44.560]   - Somebody with a following.
[01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:45.560]   - Yeah.
[01:07:45.560 --> 01:07:48.520]   - But you have to develop the following and you use mass media to do that so it's kind
[01:07:48.520 --> 01:07:49.600]   of a double edged sword.
[01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:50.600]   - It's true.
[01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:51.600]   It's a problem.
[01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:52.600]   - You start with TV.
[01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:53.600]   - Yeah.
[01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:55.680]   - You start with a mass medium.
[01:07:55.680 --> 01:07:58.000]   He put in $200,000 and made a million.
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:04.200]   I heard that he got his money back from ticket receipts because he sold concert tickets.
[01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:07.280]   And so he covered his costs, I think, initially before he even put it on.
[01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:08.280]   - Yeah.
[01:08:08.280 --> 01:08:09.720]   - I think he did well.
[01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:16.720]   - One of the reasons pirates thrived in the music industry was because the artists to
[01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:24.880]   whom one presumes the audience basically thinks they owe their loyalty to, that is audiences
[01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:29.040]   don't love record companies, but they like performers.
[01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:33.280]   The performers and the artists were basically saying, "Go ahead and pirate it.
[01:08:33.280 --> 01:08:34.280]   We don't own it.
[01:08:34.280 --> 01:08:35.280]   We don't get me in the city."
[01:08:35.280 --> 01:08:36.280]   - Go ahead.
[01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:37.280]   - I feel it.
[01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:43.880]   And I think that is really what destroyed the record industry was their greediness to the
[01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:50.560]   point where they were excluding the, well remember the artists formerly known as Prince.
[01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:51.800]   He had to go through that.
[01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:52.800]   - He wore chains.
[01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:53.800]   He wore chains.
[01:08:53.800 --> 01:08:54.800]   - He had all of his own.
[01:08:54.800 --> 01:08:57.160]   - I once asked the captain.
[01:08:57.160 --> 01:08:59.560]   I said to the captain, "Do you mind music piracy?"
[01:08:59.560 --> 01:09:00.800]   The captain of Captain and Neil.
[01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:01.800]   - Oh yeah.
[01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:02.800]   - I said, "Do you mind music piracy?"
[01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:04.200]   He said, "I don't mind music piracy."
[01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:06.800]   Neil Sadaka minds music piracy because he's got the publishing rights.
[01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:09.200]   Doesn't bother me.
[01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:12.480]   But you know where they make their money is performance.
[01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:14.480]   Well you know, you heard the story about what-
[01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:17.320]   - Well the other hand, what writers don't want to be performers.
[01:09:17.320 --> 01:09:21.080]   - I think you should go on a lecture tour like Mark Twain and Charles Dickens.
[01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:22.080]   - I don't.
[01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:25.240]   - Mark Twain used to do that to make money.
[01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:26.560]   He'd run out of money every once in a while.
[01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:28.360]   - I think that money everyone saw you make a big tour.
[01:09:28.360 --> 01:09:29.360]   - Yeah.
[01:09:29.360 --> 01:09:30.360]   - Leo, you know the story.
[01:09:30.360 --> 01:09:31.360]   - That's fun.
[01:09:31.360 --> 01:09:36.520]   - I didn't, I was also doing pretty well as a professor.
[01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:41.040]   I just, I like to write and you work alone and you don't have people looking over your
[01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:42.040]   show.
[01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:43.360]   - I think Jerry could bring back Mark Twain tonight.
[01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:44.360]   He's the next Hal Holbrook.
[01:09:44.360 --> 01:09:45.360]   - Yeah.
[01:09:45.360 --> 01:09:46.360]   - Go ahead.
[01:09:46.360 --> 01:09:47.360]   Go ahead.
[01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:48.360]   You were talking-
[01:09:48.360 --> 01:09:52.800]   - You know, you've heard the story about what you two's Bono said when he was-
[01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:53.800]   - No.
[01:09:53.800 --> 01:09:55.280]   - Napster was first described to him.
[01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:56.280]   - Yeah.
[01:09:56.280 --> 01:10:00.360]   - But he said was, "Oh, well we've made enough money now, haven't we?"
[01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:04.360]   - He's not with the metallic guy, as I said.
[01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:05.360]   - No.
[01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:06.720]   Lars Ulrich said, "We want more money."
[01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:07.720]   - Right.
[01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:08.720]   - Money, money, money.
[01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:09.720]   - Let's take a break.
[01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:13.400]   If you want money, I think the best thing to do is to go and look in your closet, in your
[01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:15.120]   drawers.
[01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:17.040]   You practically have cash sitting on the floor.
[01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:21.520]   John C. de Vorek has an entire room sitting over a Chevron station filled with money.
[01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:22.520]   Did you know that, John?
[01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:23.520]   - No.
[01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:24.520]   - Filled with money because if you took-
[01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:25.520]   - Filled with money?
[01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:26.520]   - Filled with money.
[01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:30.320]   If you took that stuff and you went to gazelle.com, you could trade those old-
[01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:32.920]   used gadgets in for cash.
[01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:34.920]   Cold hard filthy lukere.
[01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:35.920]   - Really?
[01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:36.920]   - Yes.
[01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:37.920]   I'm in.
[01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:38.920]   - Good gee, gimme something.
[01:10:38.920 --> 01:10:39.920]   Okay, let's see.
[01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:46.000]   I've got a Kindle Fire for Christmas, but I really want an iPad too.
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.160]   So, let's type in Kindle Fire tablet.
[01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:49.160]   We'll search.
[01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:51.160]   Then you say, "No, it's in good shape.
[01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:52.280]   I didn't even take it out of the box."
[01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:53.880]   So that means I have all the original stuff.
[01:10:53.880 --> 01:10:54.880]   Let's just see what it's worth.
[01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:55.880]   - So what are you gonna send?
[01:10:55.880 --> 01:10:56.880]   Yeah.
[01:10:56.880 --> 01:10:57.880]   - How much would that be worth you think?
[01:10:57.880 --> 01:10:58.880]   - Fifty bucks.
[01:10:58.880 --> 01:10:59.880]   - Sixty-five bucks.
[01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:00.880]   That's good.
[01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:01.880]   That's a start.
[01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:03.960]   - Yeah, it's better than poking an eye with a sharp stick.
[01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:07.440]   - Let me put something in that's worth something here.
[01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:08.440]   Let's go back here.
[01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:09.440]   Okay, so I'm gonna add that to the box.
[01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:12.200]   So you add to the box that gets put in the box.
[01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:13.320]   You can just provide the box.
[01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:15.480]   They provide the postage.
[01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:16.480]   How about I have the-
[01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:17.480]   - All kinds of old crap.
[01:11:17.480 --> 01:11:18.480]   Let's try some of this.
[01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:19.480]   - What do you have?
[01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:20.480]   What do you have?
[01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:21.480]   - I got some old bitsurfer motives for Motorola.
[01:11:21.480 --> 01:11:22.480]   - I don't think that's gonna have any value.
[01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:24.040]   - I ask the end-products are worth money.
[01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:26.040]   - I don't think that's gonna have any value.
[01:11:26.040 --> 01:11:28.680]   - He did has value if anybody knows what they're doing.
[01:11:28.680 --> 01:11:29.680]   - He's on the box.
[01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:31.880]   Come on, bit surfer.
[01:11:31.880 --> 01:11:33.560]   - I don't think they're gonna have bit surfer-
[01:11:33.560 --> 01:11:35.560]   - I got some ISD and motives ladies and gentlemen.
[01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:36.560]   - I don't think they're gonna have-
[01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:39.120]   - Let's say you have an iPhone 4, 162 bucks.
[01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:40.120]   - For what?
[01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:41.560]   - For my bit surfer-modem?
[01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:42.560]   - No!
[01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:44.200]   - Oh, I don't think-
[01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:47.440]   So if it's something like that that is completely worthless-
[01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:48.440]   - It's not worthless.
[01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:49.440]   - They will recycle it.
[01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:50.440]   - They will recycle it.
[01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:51.440]   - They will recycle it.
[01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:52.440]   - It's worth tons of money.
[01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:53.440]   - Intent for whom?
[01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:54.440]   - People who have-
[01:11:54.440 --> 01:11:55.440]   - Who even can get an ISDM line anymore?
[01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:56.440]   - You can do it.
[01:11:56.440 --> 01:11:57.440]   You can do ISDM.
[01:11:57.440 --> 01:11:58.440]   - You have to beg the phone company.
[01:11:58.440 --> 01:11:59.680]   - You can have an ISDM line.
[01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:01.720]   - Like, dude, we have one switch.
[01:12:01.720 --> 01:12:03.840]   It's down in San Diego.
[01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:04.840]   You really-
[01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:05.840]   - No, I wanted.
[01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:07.560]   And then what do you get?
[01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:08.880]   128 kilobits a second.
[01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:10.680]   - Yeah, but it's like solid connection.
[01:12:10.680 --> 01:12:11.520]   So you can-
[01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:12.520]   - It's good for voice.
[01:12:12.520 --> 01:12:13.520]   - That's what I use for the radio.
[01:12:13.520 --> 01:12:14.520]   - No, I'm still using it.
[01:12:14.520 --> 01:12:15.520]   - You still use it.
[01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:16.520]   - I still use it.
[01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:17.520]   - We have two ISDM lines in here.
[01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:18.520]   - You have two ISDM lines in here.
[01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:19.520]   - And I know you're really killing me.
[01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:20.520]   - Well, I know.
[01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:22.000]   It's what do you have two for?
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:23.000]   - Because redundancy.
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:24.000]   - One for each foot?
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:25.000]   - Yes.
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:28.000]   - The, actually the funny thing is-
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:31.000]   - You have to kind of like work the system to get one.
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:32.000]   They don't want to give you one.
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:33.000]   - Yeah, I had one.
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:34.000]   I used to have one.
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:35.000]   I used to have one.
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:36.000]   I used to have one.
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:37.000]   I used to have one from the internet connection.
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000]   - Yeah, that's my first broadband, so called.
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:40.000]   - Yeah, it worked.
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:41.000]   - So this is the deal.
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:44.000]   Go to gazelle.com and put in all that stuff.
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:45.000]   Put it all in the box.
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:46.000]   Send it to them.
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000]   They'll send you, they can give you money from PayPal.
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:49.000]   They'll send you a check if you want.
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:50.000]   A Walmart gift card.
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:53.000]   What I would recommend is an Amazon gift card.
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000]   Because you get a 5% bonus.
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000]   So you just get an additional 5%.
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:02.000]   They would love to buy your used cameras, your laptops, your tablets, your MP3 players, your
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:05.000]   cell phones, anything you're not using, you can get cash for it.
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:12.000]   There are 22 categories, not including ISDN, BitServe, or Modems.
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:15.000]   Every gadget worth a dollar or more gets free shipping.
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:18.000]   And if you, so what you do is you get a couple of gadgets in there so you get the free shipping
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:22.000]   and then throw in stuff that is not worth anything, but they'll recycle responsibly.
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:23.000]   Listen to this, John.
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:26.000]   Not only do they not ship it off short as some Chinese prison camp.
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:29.000]   They don't even put it in the landfill.
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:32.000]   They recycle it so that everything gets used.
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:33.000]   I do declare.
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:34.000]   I declare.
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:35.000]   That's it.
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:39.000]   Will they buy my old CPM Lisp compiler?
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:40.000]   Oh, I'll buy that.
[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:41.000]   Seems unlikely.
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:42.000]   Wait a minute.
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000]   It's a machine that's just for Lisp.
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000]   No, no, no, it's for software.
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:47.000]   No, it's a compiler software.
[01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000]   I got a WordStar 3.2.
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:50.000]   See what it's worth.
[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000]   I'm not trying that.
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:55.000]   I got a couple old CPM machines.
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:58.000]   And I've got around to.
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000]   Yeah, do you have those as an old KPro?
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:03.000]   You have that old S100 bus machine used to write about.
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:04.000]   KPro.
[01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:05.000]   You see, you heard it.
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:06.000]   No KPro in here.
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:07.000]   KPro in that before.
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:08.000]   KPro.
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:09.000]   KPro.
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:10.000]   I.I.
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:11.000]   Right?
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000]   No, they have GoPro, but not KPro.
[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:14.000]   You see that up there on the shelf?
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:15.000]   We got an Osborne right up there.
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:16.000]   See it.
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:17.000]   Check it out.
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:18.000]   We're going to have one.
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:19.000]   No, they won't take that.
[01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:20.000]   Come on.
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:21.000]   What good is it?
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:22.000]   Stuff that you have.
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:23.000]   You see, you guys are unusual.
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:24.000]   I don't think stuff.
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:25.000]   You have old crap.
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:26.000]   Yeah, we've kept it.
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:27.000]   Yeah, you've kept it already.
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:30.000]   So they just want us to sell them the good stuff.
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:31.000]   The stuff that they can use.
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:32.000]   They can resell.
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:33.000]   Oh, okay.
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:34.000]   Some value.
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:35.000]   Why don't you say so?
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:42.000]   Like your old Canon power shot or your Samsung Galaxy Tab or your MacBook Air, the stuff that
[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:43.000]   you no longer use.
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000]   I'll give you money for a MacBook Air.
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:46.000]   How about all the Olympus cameras?
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:47.000]   Absolutely.
[01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:51.000]   Now everybody in the world and Olympus camera at one time.
[01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:54.000]   I've got a whole bunch of VGA cameras.
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:57.000]   I don't think they want those VGA cameras.
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:58.000]   No.
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:14:59.000]   No.
[01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:05.000]   No, if you had maybe black and white Logitech camera from this, this can't be worth anything.
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000]   But this was my first digital camera.
[01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:10.000]   If I make no noticeable flaws, let's just see how the curiosity.
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000]   Yeah, see, the price has now gotten to zero.
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:13.000]   See the graph?
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:14.000]   Oh, they show you a graph.
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000]   They show you a graph of how the price is falling.
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:19.000]   Don't delay those gadgets in your closet.
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:20.000]   They're not getting more value.
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000]   Well, at least these guys are honest.
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:23.000]   Yeah.
[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:24.000]   So try it out.
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:25.000]   I really love it.
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:26.000]   Yeah, it's probably a great way to get rid of stuff.
[01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000]   I bet you I've got a couple pieces of junk that I can get rid of.
[01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:33.000]   John, you probably have thousands of dollars worth of stuff just sitting in a drawer somewhere.
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:34.000]   Maybe.
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:35.000]   Of course you do.
[01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:36.000]   Yeah.
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:37.000]   Gazelle.com, we all do.
[01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:44.000]   I had the old OLPC on my shelf, you know, the one laptop per child, XO.
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:47.000]   And I did the deal a couple of years ago.
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.680]   You'd buy one and you'd get for a kid and you'd get one.
[01:15:49.680 --> 01:15:52.040]   You got two in a sense and one would go to a kid.
[01:15:52.040 --> 01:15:54.080]   And then they sent me a note saying, you know, we could take that other one.
[01:15:54.080 --> 01:15:55.080]   We still have them.
[01:15:55.080 --> 01:15:56.080]   And so I sent them the other one.
[01:15:56.080 --> 01:15:59.720]   But now at CES, they're going to show a new OLPC.
[01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:02.000]   Finally, they've got it down a hundred bucks.
[01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:03.400]   And it's a tablet.
[01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:04.400]   It's a tablet.
[01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:05.400]   Yeah.
[01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:06.400]   Well, that's a tablet.
[01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:07.400]   Well, what do you mean?
[01:16:07.400 --> 01:16:08.400]   Oh, that's a tablet.
[01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:11.440]   Don't you think kids today in an underdeveloped?
[01:16:11.440 --> 01:16:12.440]   Tanzania.
[01:16:12.440 --> 01:16:14.760]   They want a tablet.
[01:16:14.760 --> 01:16:17.400]   It's got Android on it or sugar.
[01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:22.520]   Which sugar is the interface that they did, the small talk based interface that they did
[01:16:22.520 --> 01:16:23.840]   for the small talk.
[01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:24.840]   Yeah.
[01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:25.840]   Brother.
[01:16:25.840 --> 01:16:27.240]   No, small talk's great.
[01:16:27.240 --> 01:16:30.480]   You were just talking about LISP, Jerry, defend me.
[01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:32.560]   It's a little old.
[01:16:32.560 --> 01:16:34.600]   No, no, no, small talk is still operating.
[01:16:34.600 --> 01:16:37.760]   Sugar is actually really easy for kids to use.
[01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:39.480]   Look, it's got a little rubber lid on it.
[01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:40.480]   A rubber lid.
[01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:41.480]   Yeah.
[01:16:41.480 --> 01:16:42.480]   It's very reliable.
[01:16:42.480 --> 01:16:43.480]   I can't wait to see that.
[01:16:43.480 --> 01:16:44.480]   That's going to be a serious.
[01:16:44.480 --> 01:16:45.480]   Look, right?
[01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:47.160]   If I was going there, I was in the first place I'd go.
[01:16:47.160 --> 01:16:48.160]   Okay, maybe not the first place.
[01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:49.480]   Well, it's not for you, John.
[01:16:49.480 --> 01:16:50.480]   It isn't for you, John.
[01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:53.120]   The whole thing is this dubious.
[01:16:53.120 --> 01:16:58.920]   You know, somebody wrote an article about how most of the stuff announced at CES is
[01:16:58.920 --> 01:17:00.600]   actually pretty dubious.
[01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:04.600]   Like 90% of it either doesn't get made or loses money or goes out of business.
[01:17:04.600 --> 01:17:06.760]   Lady Gaga glasses.
[01:17:06.760 --> 01:17:07.760]   Perfect example.
[01:17:07.760 --> 01:17:08.760]   Right.
[01:17:08.760 --> 01:17:09.760]   They were these glasses.
[01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:10.760]   You take a picture.
[01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:12.440]   She, Lady Gaga was at CES last year.
[01:17:12.440 --> 01:17:13.440]   To us?
[01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:14.800]   You're right, Booth, showing off these glasses.
[01:17:14.800 --> 01:17:18.520]   You take a picture and then the picture would show up on the glasses facing out.
[01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:20.240]   Like somebody would want that.
[01:17:20.240 --> 01:17:22.040]   Did she?
[01:17:22.040 --> 01:17:23.520]   Lady Gaga was at the show.
[01:17:23.520 --> 01:17:24.520]   Yeah.
[01:17:24.520 --> 01:17:25.520]   Yeah.
[01:17:25.520 --> 01:17:27.160]   She's not going to be there this year, but for her.
[01:17:27.160 --> 01:17:28.320]   Fitty sense going to be there.
[01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:29.320]   Fitty sense.
[01:17:29.320 --> 01:17:30.320]   Fitty sense going to be there.
[01:17:30.320 --> 01:17:31.320]   Oh my God.
[01:17:31.320 --> 01:17:33.320]   Justin, look, she's stunned.
[01:17:33.320 --> 01:17:34.720]   Justin Bieber is going to be there.
[01:17:34.720 --> 01:17:35.720]   There you have it.
[01:17:35.720 --> 01:17:36.720]   I tell you.
[01:17:36.720 --> 01:17:37.720]   And get ready.
[01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:38.720]   Snooky.
[01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:39.720]   No.
[01:17:39.720 --> 01:17:41.280]   Yes.
[01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:45.760]   I got an email from CES saying, look at all the celebrities who are coming to see us.
[01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:47.680]   Yeah, that was a great email.
[01:17:47.680 --> 01:17:50.880]   That's really that's some lineup they got.
[01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:52.600]   You got that email too, huh?
[01:17:52.600 --> 01:17:53.600]   Yeah.
[01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:54.600]   Wow.
[01:17:54.600 --> 01:17:56.600]   Leo, I'm going to have her.
[01:17:56.600 --> 01:17:57.600]   I'm not going.
[01:17:57.600 --> 01:17:58.600]   All right.
[01:17:58.600 --> 01:17:59.600]   We're going to let Dwight go.
[01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:05.840]   Dwight is the Chronicles great tech blogger and writer and you can catch his stuff at blog.cron.com/techblog and
[01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:11.240]   technology bites on the Pacifica radio in the Houston area every Wednesday you said.
[01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:12.240]   Happy Wednesday night.
[01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:13.240]   KPFTs.
[01:18:13.240 --> 01:18:15.720]   That's the same Pacifica radio that we have out here.
[01:18:15.720 --> 01:18:16.720]   Yeah, it's hippie radio.
[01:18:16.720 --> 01:18:17.720]   The hippie radio.
[01:18:17.720 --> 01:18:18.720]   Hippie radio.
[01:18:18.720 --> 01:18:19.720]   Radio for peace.
[01:18:19.720 --> 01:18:20.720]   Peace.
[01:18:20.720 --> 01:18:21.720]   Yeah, peace.
[01:18:21.720 --> 01:18:22.720]   Peace and freedom.
[01:18:22.720 --> 01:18:23.720]   World.
[01:18:23.720 --> 01:18:26.560]   And and you are not going to see yes either.
[01:18:26.560 --> 01:18:30.040]   And I thought that that this you of all people would be at CES every year.
[01:18:30.040 --> 01:18:31.720]   Now I went last year.
[01:18:31.720 --> 01:18:33.480]   I think I'm going to go every other year.
[01:18:33.480 --> 01:18:34.480]   Yeah.
[01:18:34.480 --> 01:18:35.960]   That used to be the old rule for CES.
[01:18:35.960 --> 01:18:39.400]   You're over here the second or third year because nothing turned over that much.
[01:18:39.400 --> 01:18:40.400]   Well, Dwight, I'm sorry.
[01:18:40.400 --> 01:18:43.000]   I don't see you there, but you can watch our coverage and you don't have to go.
[01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:44.000]   See.
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:45.000]   All right.
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:46.000]   Have fun.
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:47.000]   Thank you.
[01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:48.000]   Dwight Silverman.
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:49.000]   Great to have you on.
[01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:50.000]   Always a pleasure.
[01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:51.000]   Here are some of the things that were shown.
[01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:55.920]   This is from Device, which is a gadget blog that were shown last year at CES that have
[01:18:55.920 --> 01:19:00.000]   really taken off like Sony's 3D TV goggles.
[01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:01.000]   You have the shot.
[01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:02.000]   Why don't you throw that up?
[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:03.000]   You got to see these things.
[01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:04.000]   I wore them.
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:05.000]   Uh huh.
[01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.680]   That's the way to go around town.
[01:19:07.680 --> 01:19:08.960]   That's that's going to go well.
[01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:12.800]   How about these, the Lady Gaga camera glasses?
[01:19:12.800 --> 01:19:14.800]   How much do you think Polarite paid her?
[01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:15.920]   They said she much.
[01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:17.520]   She developed those, right?
[01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:18.520]   Sure.
[01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:19.520]   Yeah.
[01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:20.520]   Let's see what else here.
[01:19:20.520 --> 01:19:22.520]   We've got the razor switch played.
[01:19:22.520 --> 01:19:23.520]   What the heck is that?
[01:19:23.520 --> 01:19:24.760]   Seven inch gaming machine.
[01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:25.760]   See the buttons?
[01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:26.760]   Look at the keyboard.
[01:19:26.760 --> 01:19:31.720]   Dedicated OLED screens on the keyboard that would tie into the game you're playing.
[01:19:31.720 --> 01:19:34.320]   So it'd be like a special dedicated controller.
[01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:36.560]   They didn't even make it.
[01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:38.360]   What else here?
[01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:42.080]   It's of all kinds that just didn't happen to be iPads.
[01:19:42.080 --> 01:19:46.400]   Like the Zoom from Motorola, the playbook from RIM.
[01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:47.680]   Right.
[01:19:47.680 --> 01:19:49.080]   We thought that was going to be big.
[01:19:49.080 --> 01:19:50.280]   The razor is still going.
[01:19:50.280 --> 01:19:51.280]   Remember this one?
[01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:56.600]   This is the, this is the atrix, the Motorola atrix phone that had its own keyboard and
[01:19:56.600 --> 01:19:59.280]   you would dock it into.
[01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:01.920]   The lap dock cost 250 bucks.
[01:20:01.920 --> 01:20:03.420]   Yeah.
[01:20:03.420 --> 01:20:04.420]   Here's another one.
[01:20:04.420 --> 01:20:05.420]   We'll probably see this again.
[01:20:05.420 --> 01:20:07.960]   They show this every year, the bendy AMOLED screen.
[01:20:07.960 --> 01:20:10.680]   I've seen this, I've seen it and I've seen it.
[01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:11.680]   Every year.
[01:20:11.680 --> 01:20:13.520]   It's like they don't ever want to make it.
[01:20:13.520 --> 01:20:16.240]   They just want to show it to you because it gets people.
[01:20:16.240 --> 01:20:19.360]   How about this Polaroid came back with instant cameras last year?
[01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:21.720]   Yeah, it's a different Polaroid, unfortunately.
[01:20:21.720 --> 01:20:22.720]   Who is it?
[01:20:22.720 --> 01:20:23.720]   Because they had Lady Gaga.
[01:20:23.720 --> 01:20:25.560]   They spent a lot of money to get Lady Gaga.
[01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:26.560]   Yeah.
[01:20:26.560 --> 01:20:27.560]   Who is it?
[01:20:27.560 --> 01:20:29.800]   I mean, it seems like someone, Israeli investors or something.
[01:20:29.800 --> 01:20:31.200]   I have no idea.
[01:20:31.200 --> 01:20:32.200]   I'll look into it.
[01:20:32.200 --> 01:20:34.040]   Would you find out who that is?
[01:20:34.040 --> 01:20:35.040]   LG touched you.
[01:20:35.040 --> 01:20:39.160]   What has happened is Polaroid make anything, anybody buys it?
[01:20:39.160 --> 01:20:40.160]   Somebody sold the name.
[01:20:40.160 --> 01:20:41.720]   I think they sold the name.
[01:20:41.720 --> 01:20:42.720]   It's like Packard Bell.
[01:20:42.720 --> 01:20:44.120]   They just sold the name.
[01:20:44.120 --> 01:20:45.920]   Now here's a sad story from this week.
[01:20:45.920 --> 01:20:47.960]   Kodak, the rumors are strong.
[01:20:47.960 --> 01:20:49.240]   Kodak will either be delisted.
[01:20:49.240 --> 01:20:53.840]   Their stock's gone from 80 bucks 10 years ago to 50 cents on New York Stock Exchange.
[01:20:53.840 --> 01:20:55.440]   Yeah, 50 cents.
[01:20:55.440 --> 01:20:59.480]   And you're not allowed to be a 50 cent stock on the prestigious New York Stock Exchange.
[01:20:59.480 --> 01:21:00.480]   There's minimums.
[01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:02.800]   We've got to have some standards.
[01:21:02.800 --> 01:21:08.200]   And there's rumors if they can't send sell their patent portfolio, they're gone.
[01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:09.200]   Kodak would be gone.
[01:21:09.200 --> 01:21:10.200]   Chapter 11.
[01:21:10.200 --> 01:21:11.200]   I find this hard to believe.
[01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:13.200]   It's called creative destruction.
[01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:14.200]   Yeah.
[01:21:14.200 --> 01:21:15.200]   Collie.
[01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:17.200]   They invented the digital camera.
[01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:18.200]   The iron unit.
[01:21:18.200 --> 01:21:24.320]   The big deal of God, they made more film than everybody else put together.
[01:21:24.320 --> 01:21:25.680]   They invented the digital camera.
[01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:27.040]   So here's what happened.
[01:21:27.040 --> 01:21:28.840]   They knew the digital was going to happen.
[01:21:28.840 --> 01:21:32.680]   This is a really good morality tale.
[01:21:32.680 --> 01:21:34.120]   They knew digital was going to happen.
[01:21:34.120 --> 01:21:38.000]   They knew that their business was going to be completely reinvented.
[01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:41.000]   And they got into it and they make great digital cameras.
[01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:45.400]   The problem was, somebody asked a Kodak VP, said, "Here's the problem.
[01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:52.760]   The margins on film and processing were so high that by losing film and processing,
[01:21:52.760 --> 01:21:56.200]   we're not able to replace those revenues by just selling digital cameras."
[01:21:56.200 --> 01:21:58.040]   No, that's because they were addicted to the margins.
[01:21:58.040 --> 01:21:59.240]   They were addicted to the margins.
[01:21:59.240 --> 01:22:00.240]   Yeah.
[01:22:00.240 --> 01:22:02.440]   I want to say the big John C fan.
[01:22:02.440 --> 01:22:03.440]   You see that?
[01:22:03.440 --> 01:22:04.440]   My name's spelled wrong.
[01:22:04.440 --> 01:22:05.440]   It's J.O.H.
[01:22:05.440 --> 01:22:06.440]   John.
[01:22:06.440 --> 01:22:07.440]   Anyway, go on.
[01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:08.440]   There's a guy in the chat room named big John C fan.
[01:22:08.440 --> 01:22:09.440]   Yeah.
[01:22:09.440 --> 01:22:10.440]   And he keeps harassing me.
[01:22:10.440 --> 01:22:14.240]   Stop harassing John C and spell his name right.
[01:22:14.240 --> 01:22:15.600]   So they created the digital camera.
[01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:16.600]   They got into it.
[01:22:16.600 --> 01:22:18.080]   They had a good digital strategy.
[01:22:18.080 --> 01:22:19.080]   They bought a photo.
[01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:21.160]   Remember, they had a Kodak easy share site.
[01:22:21.160 --> 01:22:22.360]   It made it very easy.
[01:22:22.360 --> 01:22:24.360]   The problem wasn't that they didn't succeed in digital.
[01:22:24.360 --> 01:22:27.720]   The problem was their business model didn't work.
[01:22:27.720 --> 01:22:29.960]   They couldn't make as much money as they did in film and processing.
[01:22:29.960 --> 01:22:31.960]   They were set up for the high margin business.
[01:22:31.960 --> 01:22:32.960]   They were set up.
[01:22:32.960 --> 01:22:33.960]   So is that--
[01:22:33.960 --> 01:22:34.960]   If you were set up for low margin business, you do fine.
[01:22:34.960 --> 01:22:35.960]   Could they--
[01:22:35.960 --> 01:22:36.960]   Like the grocery business.
[01:22:36.960 --> 01:22:37.960]   Maybe Safeway should buy them.
[01:22:37.960 --> 01:22:38.960]   Safeway.
[01:22:38.960 --> 01:22:41.480]   The people who do a lot of bookkeeping will get that.
[01:22:41.480 --> 01:22:44.320]   I think that's hilarious.
[01:22:44.320 --> 01:22:51.000]   Vince Serf, the father of the internet, man who's been very vocal against SOPA, weighing
[01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:56.320]   in on an argument that's been going around that the internet and access to it is a fundamental
[01:22:56.320 --> 01:22:57.320]   right.
[01:22:57.320 --> 01:22:58.320]   Mm.
[01:22:58.320 --> 01:22:59.960]   He said it is not a right.
[01:22:59.960 --> 01:23:03.280]   Technology is an enabler of rights but not a right itself.
[01:23:03.280 --> 01:23:06.240]   There's a high bar for something to be considered a human right.
[01:23:06.240 --> 01:23:08.960]   He's writing in the New York Times.
[01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:13.520]   It has to be something we need to be able to leave healthy, meaningful lives like freedom
[01:23:13.520 --> 01:23:16.080]   from torture or freedom from conscience.
[01:23:16.080 --> 01:23:18.240]   But internet is not one of those.
[01:23:18.240 --> 01:23:19.240]   You agree?
[01:23:19.240 --> 01:23:20.240]   Yeah.
[01:23:20.240 --> 01:23:23.240]   Jerry, I'm sure you agree too, being a good libertarian.
[01:23:23.240 --> 01:23:32.320]   I agree to the extent that I don't feel like trying to multiply fundamental rights.
[01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:33.320]   Right.
[01:23:33.320 --> 01:23:40.280]   But I am also concerned that without the mechanism of free speech and the internet is becoming
[01:23:40.280 --> 01:23:46.600]   essentially the mechanism of free speech, you don't have any way to get your fundamental
[01:23:46.600 --> 01:23:47.600]   rights.
[01:23:47.600 --> 01:23:55.080]   You can run a mammograph in the basement, may have been an important right back in 50
[01:23:55.080 --> 01:24:01.280]   years ago, but it isn't going to do you much good to get your cause out now.
[01:24:01.280 --> 01:24:11.000]   I think there is implied in the freedom of speech concept, a freedom to be allowed to
[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:12.440]   be heard.
[01:24:12.440 --> 01:24:18.680]   It doesn't require me to listen, but it does at least allow you to make it possible for
[01:24:18.680 --> 01:24:20.200]   me to listen.
[01:24:20.200 --> 01:24:23.920]   And without internet access, I don't think you have free speech.
[01:24:23.920 --> 01:24:24.920]   Very well said.
[01:24:24.920 --> 01:24:30.720]   So the printing press wouldn't be a fundamental right, but it would be a critical technology
[01:24:30.720 --> 01:24:32.800]   for the fundamental right of free speech.
[01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:39.160]   And in the constitution of 1787, it basically was the printing press that they intended
[01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:40.160]   to protect.
[01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:41.160]   Right.
[01:24:41.160 --> 01:24:46.080]   So the freedom of speech, they really meant pamphletering, right, poor Richard Zalman
[01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:47.080]   act.
[01:24:47.080 --> 01:24:52.640]   That's a little pain, a little letter press in your basement and run off things saying
[01:24:52.640 --> 01:24:54.440]   the president is a schmuck.
[01:24:54.440 --> 01:24:55.440]   Right.
[01:24:55.440 --> 01:24:57.560]   And that's sort of, you know, how about a printing press?
[01:24:57.560 --> 01:24:58.560]   It is.
[01:24:58.560 --> 01:24:59.560]   It's that's I think a completely apt.
[01:24:59.560 --> 01:25:00.560]   Yes.
[01:25:00.560 --> 01:25:02.040]   It needs to be protected in the same way.
[01:25:02.040 --> 01:25:03.320]   There's also here's the good news.
[01:25:03.320 --> 01:25:08.000]   There's also a self serving interest for governments to preserve a free and open internet.
[01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:11.440]   It is a mechanism for innovation and economic development.
[01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:12.440]   It's very powerful.
[01:25:12.440 --> 01:25:13.440]   Oh, yeah.
[01:25:13.440 --> 01:25:16.600]   And so it is in their interest to preserve a free and open internet.
[01:25:16.600 --> 01:25:23.440]   I think even China realizes that by closing the internet is in the long run deleterious
[01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:28.840]   to their economic prosperity in a meta sense, perhaps, but I think individuals will find
[01:25:28.840 --> 01:25:34.480]   these things negative because they attacked the damn corruption of the individual.
[01:25:34.480 --> 01:25:40.120]   So if you're the schmuck, you don't want that medium to be allowed to call you schmuck.
[01:25:40.120 --> 01:25:42.040]   And that's what to me, Sopa and Pipper about.
[01:25:42.040 --> 01:25:44.600]   We love the internet as long as it doesn't do anything we don't like.
[01:25:44.600 --> 01:25:45.600]   Right.
[01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:49.240]   You know, it's a great medium as long as it doesn't criticize us.
[01:25:49.240 --> 01:25:52.120]   Well, criticizing is one thing.
[01:25:52.120 --> 01:25:53.320]   Paris is another.
[01:25:53.320 --> 01:25:54.320]   I don't know.
[01:25:54.320 --> 01:26:00.800]   I'm really following this with considerable interest.
[01:26:00.800 --> 01:26:06.240]   And I don't think the answers are as clear as I wish they were.
[01:26:06.240 --> 01:26:07.240]   Yeah.
[01:26:07.240 --> 01:26:12.000]   Well, look, and that'd be nice if everything were cut and dried and black and white.
[01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.200]   And you could just say, yeah, that's obviously good.
[01:26:14.200 --> 01:26:16.120]   That's obviously bad.
[01:26:16.120 --> 01:26:23.040]   But I think those of us who are technologists have a certain duty to try to protect this
[01:26:23.040 --> 01:26:24.040]   thing.
[01:26:24.040 --> 01:26:25.040]   Oh, yeah.
[01:26:25.040 --> 01:26:26.920]   A responsibility responsibility.
[01:26:26.920 --> 01:26:27.920]   Responsibility.
[01:26:27.920 --> 01:26:30.320]   Responsibility is perhaps the right word.
[01:26:30.320 --> 01:26:31.320]   Yes.
[01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:34.640]   You know, we don't have to protect the spot watch.
[01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:37.240]   We could just let that go away quietly and silently.
[01:26:37.240 --> 01:26:38.240]   The spot watch.
[01:26:38.240 --> 01:26:39.240]   Remember that?
[01:26:39.240 --> 01:26:40.240]   No.
[01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:41.240]   That was the Microsoft watch.
[01:26:41.240 --> 01:26:42.760]   Oh, that watch.
[01:26:42.760 --> 01:26:44.680]   That got its information from the FM carrier.
[01:26:44.680 --> 01:26:45.680]   Oh, that was from the FM carrier.
[01:26:45.680 --> 01:26:46.480]   I forgot all about that thing.
[01:26:46.480 --> 01:26:48.240]   They just killed it on January.
[01:26:48.240 --> 01:26:49.240]   Just killed it?
[01:26:49.240 --> 01:26:50.240]   Yes.
[01:26:50.240 --> 01:26:51.240]   I didn't know it was.
[01:26:51.240 --> 01:26:53.200]   I thought it was Dan.
[01:26:53.200 --> 01:26:55.440]   I thought it was the away.
[01:26:55.440 --> 01:26:59.440]   The server, the spot server, was killed on January 1.
[01:26:59.440 --> 01:27:03.040]   So if you had a spot watch, it worked right up until last week.
[01:27:03.040 --> 01:27:06.160]   Hey, I didn't buy this thing if you ever crap out on me.
[01:27:06.160 --> 01:27:10.560]   Actually, there is a more serious impact because apparently some of the Garmin GPS's
[01:27:10.560 --> 01:27:13.240]   used the spot service to do traffic information.
[01:27:13.240 --> 01:27:14.240]   Oops.
[01:27:14.240 --> 01:27:16.920]   That was kind of a bad bet.
[01:27:16.920 --> 01:27:17.920]   Yeah.
[01:27:17.920 --> 01:27:20.080]   But I think it just shows you that technology changes so rapidly.
[01:27:20.080 --> 01:27:25.240]   The idea of spot was, oh, we'll use this unused kind of carrier on FM radio.
[01:27:25.240 --> 01:27:26.240]   It's, you know, global.
[01:27:26.240 --> 01:27:31.840]   It's everywhere to sense very small, uncustomizable bits of information to rest.
[01:27:31.840 --> 01:27:32.840]   I have one of those phones.
[01:27:32.840 --> 01:27:33.840]   What do you do?
[01:27:33.840 --> 01:27:34.840]   Go to Gazelle.
[01:27:34.840 --> 01:27:39.440]   See what it's worth before they find out.
[01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:41.760]   Ten years is fast.
[01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:46.440]   Now see the C. Lynn Hartson in the chat room and saying, "Ten years was around ten years.
[01:27:46.440 --> 01:27:47.440]   That's not fast."
[01:27:47.440 --> 01:27:49.120]   Well, it depends on your time scale.
[01:27:49.120 --> 01:27:51.000]   For the internet, ten years is an infinity.
[01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:52.360]   Yeah, it's a long way.
[01:27:52.360 --> 01:27:54.760]   But on the other hand, for real life, ten years is in that way.
[01:27:54.760 --> 01:27:55.760]   I go by dog years.
[01:27:55.760 --> 01:27:57.280]   Seventy dog year.
[01:27:57.280 --> 01:28:01.480]   How many internet, I actually was asking about this the other day, how many dog years is
[01:28:01.480 --> 01:28:02.480]   seven to one, right?
[01:28:02.480 --> 01:28:03.480]   Yeah.
[01:28:03.480 --> 01:28:04.720]   What is the internet ratio?
[01:28:04.720 --> 01:28:06.760]   I think it's like 15 to one.
[01:28:06.760 --> 01:28:07.760]   20 to one.
[01:28:07.760 --> 01:28:08.760]   No, I think it's the reverse.
[01:28:08.760 --> 01:28:09.760]   Don't you go the other way?
[01:28:09.760 --> 01:28:11.960]   If you had a PC that was five years old.
[01:28:11.960 --> 01:28:14.840]   It's all that done to go, then you go right.
[01:28:14.840 --> 01:28:16.280]   It would be not 35 years old.
[01:28:16.280 --> 01:28:19.160]   It'd be like 100 years old, 80 years old.
[01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:20.160]   Well, I don't know.
[01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:21.160]   Five-year-old is used to carry.
[01:28:21.160 --> 01:28:22.160]   How old are you?
[01:28:22.160 --> 01:28:25.240]   What's J.D.A. PC?
[01:28:25.240 --> 01:28:26.800]   That's who we got.
[01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:27.960]   If you were a PC.
[01:28:27.960 --> 01:28:29.720]   I think only I don't think it would be dog years.
[01:28:29.720 --> 01:28:31.240]   I think it'd be more like two or three years.
[01:28:31.240 --> 01:28:33.160]   Yeah, if you were a PC, what kind of a PC would you be?
[01:28:33.160 --> 01:28:35.640]   What kind of PC would you be?
[01:28:35.640 --> 01:28:36.640]   I think it's cool.
[01:28:36.640 --> 01:28:37.640]   You still have those.
[01:28:37.640 --> 01:28:40.480]   Do you have those original S100 CPM machines that you wrote about?
[01:28:40.480 --> 01:28:41.480]   It's what he uses.
[01:28:41.480 --> 01:28:42.480]   A K.S.
[01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:43.480]   Manor.
[01:28:43.480 --> 01:28:44.480]   That's what I use.
[01:28:44.480 --> 01:28:45.480]   What are you talking about?
[01:28:45.480 --> 01:28:46.480]   He's using WordStar.
[01:28:46.480 --> 01:28:47.480]   No.
[01:28:47.480 --> 01:28:48.480]   No.
[01:28:48.480 --> 01:28:55.720]   I guess my original PC is now in the basement at the Smithsonian.
[01:28:55.720 --> 01:28:56.720]   Wow.
[01:28:56.720 --> 01:28:59.160]   They close that wing and they're refurbishing it.
[01:28:59.160 --> 01:29:01.040]   But it may come back up.
[01:29:01.040 --> 01:29:02.040]   That's cool.
[01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:03.040]   So you actually gave--
[01:29:03.040 --> 01:29:04.040]   They have that.
[01:29:04.040 --> 01:29:05.040]   They're going to withdraw it.
[01:29:05.040 --> 01:29:06.040]   Which one was it?
[01:29:06.040 --> 01:29:07.040]   You had names for everyone.
[01:29:07.040 --> 01:29:08.040]   Ezekiel.
[01:29:08.040 --> 01:29:09.040]   Ezekiel is actually in the Smithsonian.
[01:29:09.040 --> 01:29:13.560]   Ezekiel was on display in the Smithsonian for 25 years.
[01:29:13.560 --> 01:29:18.440]   I used to tell people how many people do you know who's personal computer or what
[01:29:18.440 --> 01:29:21.720]   computer is on display in the Smithsonian Museum.
[01:29:21.720 --> 01:29:22.720]   And I told them, oh no.
[01:29:22.720 --> 01:29:26.840]   I said, well, in the future you can say all of them.
[01:29:26.840 --> 01:29:29.760]   One of our chatters says, my computer's in the basement as well.
[01:29:29.760 --> 01:29:36.440]   I mean, they have closed that wing at the Smithsonian.
[01:29:36.440 --> 01:29:40.000]   Why did they reopen it and I do not know?
[01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:41.520]   That's historic.
[01:29:41.520 --> 01:29:43.640]   That's absolutely historic.
[01:29:43.640 --> 01:29:48.480]   Microsoft has patented walking directions that avoid crime ridden neighborhoods.
[01:29:48.480 --> 01:29:49.480]   How do you patent that?
[01:29:49.480 --> 01:29:50.480]   Well, you--
[01:29:50.480 --> 01:29:51.480]   This is a problem with this country.
[01:29:51.480 --> 01:29:56.920]   It's called-- they were issued a patent January 3rd on a computer system for quote,
[01:29:56.920 --> 01:30:03.480]   pedestrian route production walking directions that adjust the route for the unique conditions
[01:30:03.480 --> 01:30:05.640]   encountered by a person going from place to place on foot.
[01:30:05.640 --> 01:30:07.080]   Yeah, this is a prior art on this.
[01:30:07.080 --> 01:30:10.640]   I was driving around with my Google phone and it had--
[01:30:10.640 --> 01:30:11.640]   Yeah.
[01:30:11.640 --> 01:30:12.640]   It dorrotted me around a wreck.
[01:30:12.640 --> 01:30:13.640]   No.
[01:30:13.640 --> 01:30:14.640]   Yes.
[01:30:14.640 --> 01:30:15.640]   I wouldn't do that.
[01:30:15.640 --> 01:30:16.640]   I was in Seattle.
[01:30:16.640 --> 01:30:18.640]   How do we know?
[01:30:18.640 --> 01:30:22.400]   If you look at the map, they show the traffic, the green and the red, the yellow, that whole
[01:30:22.400 --> 01:30:23.400]   thing.
[01:30:23.400 --> 01:30:25.560]   They have it on the Google map on the navigator.
[01:30:25.560 --> 01:30:29.200]   And so it saw this red area on highway five going to Seattle.
[01:30:29.200 --> 01:30:33.360]   And it routed me right down through Tacoma and a route I've never taken before and took
[01:30:33.360 --> 01:30:36.000]   me back on the freeway on the other side of the accident.
[01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:37.000]   I don't know.
[01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:38.000]   Maybe it's on that.
[01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:39.000]   Maybe that's the common route.
[01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:40.000]   It didn't seem like it to me.
[01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:41.320]   No, it has traffic information.
[01:30:41.320 --> 01:30:42.400]   It does route you around it.
[01:30:42.400 --> 01:30:43.400]   So there you go.
[01:30:43.400 --> 01:30:44.400]   It does that route.
[01:30:44.400 --> 01:30:45.400]   Now what's the difference?
[01:30:45.400 --> 01:30:46.400]   Tell me what the difference is.
[01:30:46.400 --> 01:30:47.400]   Look at all this.
[01:30:47.400 --> 01:30:48.400]   Look at all this.
[01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:50.240]   This is the patent application.
[01:30:50.240 --> 01:30:54.800]   They refer to prior art going back to 1989 and blah, blah, blah, look at all these.
[01:30:54.800 --> 01:30:55.800]   The previous patents.
[01:30:55.800 --> 01:30:56.800]   Yeah, you know, these--
[01:30:56.800 --> 01:30:57.800]   Look at all this.
[01:30:57.800 --> 01:30:59.920]   And then read the-- I just love the language.
[01:30:59.920 --> 01:31:03.120]   It's the Nathan Miravold influence on Microsoft.
[01:31:03.120 --> 01:31:07.400]   Computer storage media, having embodied their own computer usable instructions that
[01:31:07.400 --> 01:31:09.600]   when executed, implement a system.
[01:31:09.600 --> 01:31:13.920]   The system comprising a search component that locates at least one information source,
[01:31:13.920 --> 01:31:18.280]   retains pedestrian history from a plurality of pedestrians and addresses a--
[01:31:18.280 --> 01:31:19.280]   Who writes this crap?
[01:31:19.280 --> 01:31:20.280]   Mr. Peepers apparently.
[01:31:20.280 --> 01:31:21.280]   Oh my God.
[01:31:21.280 --> 01:31:25.720]   We clearly need to have more--
[01:31:25.720 --> 01:31:26.720]   Yes, reform.
[01:31:26.720 --> 01:31:28.960]   Performances of Henry VI.
[01:31:28.960 --> 01:31:30.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:31:30.960 --> 01:31:32.960]   Patent reform is what I thought you were doing with that.
[01:31:32.960 --> 01:31:33.960]   What do you think it is?
[01:31:33.960 --> 01:31:34.960]   Come on.
[01:31:34.960 --> 01:31:38.880]   Microsoft applied for the patent in 2007.
[01:31:38.880 --> 01:31:43.160]   Compared to Google releasing its walking directions feature and in 2008, so--
[01:31:43.160 --> 01:31:45.000]   No, they're trying to give it to Google.
[01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:49.040]   Google, of course, is going to screw these guys over and everybody else in between by
[01:31:49.040 --> 01:31:51.240]   doing that deal with IBM, which we haven't discussed.
[01:31:51.240 --> 01:31:52.240]   Well, what's that?
[01:31:52.240 --> 01:31:53.240]   Tell me about that.
[01:31:53.240 --> 01:31:54.240]   They picked up--
[01:31:54.240 --> 01:31:55.240]   Patents?
[01:31:55.240 --> 01:31:57.240]   They picked up over 219 patents directly from IBM.
[01:31:57.240 --> 01:31:58.240]   You know, it's interesting because--
[01:31:58.240 --> 01:31:59.240]   And IBM always--
[01:31:59.240 --> 01:32:00.240]   And IBM always--
[01:32:00.240 --> 01:32:01.240]   All the patents.
[01:32:01.240 --> 01:32:03.080]   You guys, as long as I've known you, I've been saying, oh IBM, it's, you know, how could
[01:32:03.080 --> 01:32:04.800]   they possibly survive?
[01:32:04.800 --> 01:32:08.720]   And you've always said-- I mean, for 20 years, you've been saying they survived because they
[01:32:08.720 --> 01:32:09.720]   got patents.
[01:32:09.720 --> 01:32:10.720]   Lots of patents.
[01:32:10.720 --> 01:32:12.720]   They're number one in the world with patents.
[01:32:12.720 --> 01:32:14.040]   And that is a huge asset.
[01:32:14.040 --> 01:32:15.520]   And you were absolutely right.
[01:32:15.520 --> 01:32:17.880]   And they have prior art on everything.
[01:32:17.880 --> 01:32:21.640]   So whatever anybody does, if it has to do with technology, obviously, they're not talking
[01:32:21.640 --> 01:32:27.400]   about washing machines, whatever anybody does, IBM either has a patent around it, a blocking
[01:32:27.400 --> 01:32:33.160]   patent or prior art to kill the other patent and they did a deal with Google because I know
[01:32:33.160 --> 01:32:37.400]   that IBM was irked at Apple over various--
[01:32:37.400 --> 01:32:39.800]   Over in Steve Jobs picture where he's flipping them off.
[01:32:39.800 --> 01:32:40.800]   Did you see that?
[01:32:40.800 --> 01:32:42.440]   Yep, there's one of them.
[01:32:42.440 --> 01:32:46.800]   Steve Jobs walk around New York City, I think with Andy Hertzfeld, because Andy posted the
[01:32:46.800 --> 01:32:49.920]   picture on Google+, he says, "I don't think anybody's ever seen this picture."
[01:32:49.920 --> 01:32:53.200]   And he's standing under the IBM logo and he's flipping them off.
[01:32:53.200 --> 01:32:55.360]   And then you have the Microsoft feud with IBM.
[01:32:55.360 --> 01:32:57.480]   And so IBM says, "Here, Google."
[01:32:57.480 --> 01:33:00.760]   And you know, there are people out there who know how to look at patents for really cool
[01:33:00.760 --> 01:33:01.760]   stuff.
[01:33:01.760 --> 01:33:09.400]   And so Google has engineers and IBM has engineers and they gave Google, I'm telling you, 200
[01:33:09.400 --> 01:33:15.960]   and plus of killer patents, you know, doomsday patents that you're going to see these lawsuits
[01:33:15.960 --> 01:33:19.720]   are going to blow up in these people's faces because Google's now going to have the upper
[01:33:19.720 --> 01:33:20.720]   hand.
[01:33:20.720 --> 01:33:21.720]   You watch.
[01:33:21.720 --> 01:33:23.960]   So because of this, I'm sure that's part of it.
[01:33:23.960 --> 01:33:26.400]   IBM is now going to screw everybody else.
[01:33:26.400 --> 01:33:28.080]   No, it's going to screw Apple.
[01:33:28.080 --> 01:33:29.080]   Apple.
[01:33:29.080 --> 01:33:31.040]   Apple and Microsoft are the targets of these patents.
[01:33:31.040 --> 01:33:32.040]   That's very interesting.
[01:33:32.040 --> 01:33:36.800]   IBM can really weigh in because of the patents and they can say, "We're going to choose a
[01:33:36.800 --> 01:33:38.360]   victor here."
[01:33:38.360 --> 01:33:40.160]   They chose Google.
[01:33:40.160 --> 01:33:41.160]   Interesting.
[01:33:41.160 --> 01:33:44.200]   We're going to take a break, come back with more with the codgers.
[01:33:44.200 --> 01:33:45.200]   The not-geezers.
[01:33:45.200 --> 01:33:46.200]   No.
[01:33:46.200 --> 01:33:47.200]   I'm coming back.
[01:33:47.200 --> 01:33:48.200]   I've got it.
[01:33:48.200 --> 01:33:50.200]   I'm coming right back.
[01:33:50.200 --> 01:33:51.200]   I'm coming right back.
[01:33:51.200 --> 01:33:53.440]   What maybe we'll call gray hair, the gray haired panel?
[01:33:53.440 --> 01:33:55.480]   You're the greatest of the group.
[01:33:55.480 --> 01:33:57.480]   I'm not including myself.
[01:33:57.480 --> 01:33:59.280]   You're graying me.
[01:33:59.280 --> 01:34:00.280]   Really?
[01:34:00.280 --> 01:34:01.280]   You're very great.
[01:34:01.280 --> 01:34:05.200]   In fact, it looks like it's fake.
[01:34:05.200 --> 01:34:06.200]   We used to work with him.
[01:34:06.200 --> 01:34:07.200]   I'm not going to say a name.
[01:34:07.200 --> 01:34:11.280]   But we worked with somebody at Tech TV who wanted more gravitas and would actually put
[01:34:11.280 --> 01:34:13.160]   white in his temples.
[01:34:13.160 --> 01:34:14.160]   Who?
[01:34:14.160 --> 01:34:15.160]   Carmen Gallo.
[01:34:15.160 --> 01:34:16.160]   Carmen Gallo.
[01:34:16.160 --> 01:34:17.160]   I still run into him.
[01:34:17.160 --> 01:34:18.160]   Yeah.
[01:34:18.160 --> 01:34:19.160]   He gave a speech at La Web.
[01:34:19.160 --> 01:34:20.160]   He is turning into--
[01:34:20.160 --> 01:34:21.160]   He's actually a good talker.
[01:34:21.160 --> 01:34:22.160]   He is a good speaker.
[01:34:22.160 --> 01:34:23.160]   He is a good speaker.
[01:34:23.160 --> 01:34:24.160]   In fact, he wrote a book on this sort of thing.
[01:34:24.160 --> 01:34:27.400]   Yeah, the public speaking techniques of Steve Jobs.
[01:34:27.400 --> 01:34:29.200]   I didn't know he did that gray thing, though.
[01:34:29.200 --> 01:34:30.040]   I'm told.
[01:34:30.040 --> 01:34:32.040]   I hope, Carmine, if you're watching it, it's not true, please.
[01:34:32.040 --> 01:34:34.520]   At one time we did a show, then I called him Carmen.
[01:34:34.520 --> 01:34:35.520]   Carmen.
[01:34:35.520 --> 01:34:36.520]   Not Carmen.
[01:34:36.520 --> 01:34:37.520]   That's a color.
[01:34:37.520 --> 01:34:38.520]   He's Carmine.
[01:34:38.520 --> 01:34:39.520]   Yeah, Carmine.
[01:34:39.520 --> 01:34:41.680]   But he would-- he would gray his temples.
[01:34:41.680 --> 01:34:42.680]   So he looked a little more--
[01:34:42.680 --> 01:34:43.680]   He doesn't have to anymore.
[01:34:43.680 --> 01:34:45.600]   And I'm sure he doesn't.
[01:34:45.600 --> 01:34:48.840]   This show brought to you by our friends at Audible, looking forward to spending some
[01:34:48.840 --> 01:34:51.280]   time with Audible at CES.
[01:34:51.280 --> 01:34:56.440]   Of course, 100,000 books in their audio bookstore, including many of Jerry's books.
[01:34:56.440 --> 01:34:59.480]   In fact, that's how I listened to the Moten God's Eye.
[01:34:59.480 --> 01:35:01.440]   I listened to Lucid for his hammer.
[01:35:01.440 --> 01:35:07.560]   And they were really-- I mean, these are very good choices for Audible books because they're
[01:35:07.560 --> 01:35:10.400]   cinematic in the prose.
[01:35:10.400 --> 01:35:13.600]   So they just come to life when a reader is reading these books.
[01:35:13.600 --> 01:35:15.760]   I'm going to make these our Audible recommendations.
[01:35:15.760 --> 01:35:17.280]   Football is also available.
[01:35:17.280 --> 01:35:19.680]   Jerry, now, you could-- you can look at all of these.
[01:35:19.680 --> 01:35:20.920]   Wow, I didn't realize.
[01:35:20.920 --> 01:35:22.280]   They've added some more.
[01:35:22.280 --> 01:35:23.280]   Yeah.
[01:35:23.280 --> 01:35:28.760]   Lucid for his hammer, the Moten God's Eye, "Footfall in Ferno, Escape from Hell, Oath of Fieldty,
[01:35:28.760 --> 01:35:30.000]   and Star Swarm."
[01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.520]   They're all in Audible.
[01:35:32.520 --> 01:35:37.680]   Which would you recommend if somebody's going to be-- this is their new to the Niven Pornel
[01:35:37.680 --> 01:35:39.640]   oeuvre?
[01:35:39.640 --> 01:35:42.600]   Which would you recommend, Jerry?
[01:35:42.600 --> 01:35:43.680]   Probably Lucid for his hammer.
[01:35:43.680 --> 01:35:45.120]   I love that.
[01:35:45.120 --> 01:35:49.800]   I quoted you the other day on the radio show from Lucid for his hammer.
[01:35:49.800 --> 01:35:52.960]   This is the story of a comet that hits Earth and the results.
[01:35:52.960 --> 01:35:56.400]   And of course, we get blown back into the dark ages.
[01:35:56.400 --> 01:36:01.280]   But one of the things you say that I love it, in a new way, this is the thesis of the book,
[01:36:01.280 --> 01:36:05.360]   is that nobody understands how anything works anymore.
[01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:11.800]   So if something were to destroy our technology infrastructure, could we rebuild it?
[01:36:11.800 --> 01:36:13.160]   Do you know how a car works?
[01:36:13.160 --> 01:36:15.200]   Do you know a microwave works?
[01:36:15.200 --> 01:36:17.120]   Do you know how a computer works?
[01:36:17.120 --> 01:36:19.720]   We've got a whole generation of kids growing up that don't have any idea.
[01:36:19.720 --> 01:36:22.200]   They just use them.
[01:36:22.200 --> 01:36:23.200]   What a great book.
[01:36:23.200 --> 01:36:25.760]   I love this book.
[01:36:25.760 --> 01:36:26.760]   Thank you.
[01:36:26.760 --> 01:36:27.760]   Yeah.
[01:36:27.760 --> 01:36:34.920]   So Audible's done a good job of putting it in reading it too.
[01:36:34.920 --> 01:36:37.320]   You like the reader and the job he did?
[01:36:37.320 --> 01:36:40.720]   I like everything about Audible.
[01:36:40.720 --> 01:36:48.480]   They pay promptly rather than the way traditional-- Amazon pays monthly.
[01:36:48.480 --> 01:36:55.400]   Which is unlike traditional publishers who pay promptly upon credible threat of lawsuit.
[01:36:55.400 --> 01:37:04.640]   But Audible pays their royalties on time and in full and without a trouble.
[01:37:04.640 --> 01:37:06.480]   No, I like Audible there.
[01:37:06.480 --> 01:37:10.000]   Well, Lucifer's hammer is a good example of an Audible frontiers production.
[01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:14.320]   So a lot of these-- a lot of great science fiction, when it came out, there weren't audio
[01:37:14.320 --> 01:37:18.440]   books or audio books were reserved for other kinds of literature.
[01:37:18.440 --> 01:37:20.640]   For the blind, basically.
[01:37:20.640 --> 01:37:21.640]   Right.
[01:37:21.640 --> 01:37:25.080]   And they didn't-- and there was mostly reading was done by amateur.
[01:37:25.080 --> 01:37:26.080]   Not so good, yeah.
[01:37:26.080 --> 01:37:28.840]   Well, they were good, but they were still amateurs.
[01:37:28.840 --> 01:37:32.520]   They weren't being paid to do 20 takes until they got it right.
[01:37:32.520 --> 01:37:35.000]   So when I joined Audible, there weren't a lot of sci-fi titles.
[01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:36.000]   But this was 2000.
[01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:37.480]   There was more than 10 years ago.
[01:37:37.480 --> 01:37:39.280]   There weren't a lot of sci-fi titles.
[01:37:39.280 --> 01:37:43.160]   Audible-- I actually spoke to one of the guys, one of the founders of Audible, who was a
[01:37:43.160 --> 01:37:46.160]   huge science fiction fan, a big fan of yours.
[01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:49.320]   And he said this was the first thing I wanted to change.
[01:37:49.320 --> 01:37:53.200]   So they actually built nine studios and started recording their own audio books.
[01:37:53.200 --> 01:37:55.040]   They call it Audible Frontiers.
[01:37:55.040 --> 01:37:58.200]   And they've put so much great science fiction on audio.
[01:37:58.200 --> 01:37:59.200]   And you're right.
[01:37:59.200 --> 01:38:01.280]   Let me play a little bit of Lucifer's hammer just so you can hear it.
[01:38:01.280 --> 01:38:03.080]   I mean, these are performances.
[01:38:03.080 --> 01:38:06.400]   Even the gods themselves struggle in vain.
[01:38:06.400 --> 01:38:07.400]   Nietzsche.
[01:38:07.400 --> 01:38:08.880]   Oh, that's the epigram.
[01:38:08.880 --> 01:38:10.200]   Okay, it's the beginning.
[01:38:10.200 --> 01:38:14.360]   January, the portent.
[01:38:14.360 --> 01:38:19.880]   The bay trees in our country are all withered and meteors fright the fixed stars of heaven.
[01:38:19.880 --> 01:38:20.880]   Another epigram.
[01:38:20.880 --> 01:38:27.000]   The face moon looks bloody on the earth and lean-looked prophets whisper fearful change.
[01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:31.400]   These signs for run the death or fall of kings.
[01:38:31.400 --> 01:38:36.240]   William Shakespeare, Richard II.
[01:38:36.240 --> 01:38:40.200]   The bloomer Sadie's turned into the big circular drive of the Beverly Hills mansion.
[01:38:40.200 --> 01:38:41.440]   Oh, now I want to listen to it.
[01:38:41.440 --> 01:38:43.040]   I know exactly what's about to happen.
[01:38:43.040 --> 01:38:44.040]   This is so great.
[01:38:44.040 --> 01:38:45.400]   Lucifer's hammer, you've got to read it.
[01:38:45.400 --> 01:38:46.400]   So here's the deal.
[01:38:46.400 --> 01:38:47.400]   I can get this to where you're free.
[01:38:47.400 --> 01:38:49.640]   Jerry still gets his royalty, but you get it for free.
[01:38:49.640 --> 01:38:50.640]   How about that?
[01:38:50.640 --> 01:38:51.640]   Everybody's happy.
[01:38:51.640 --> 01:38:54.120]   Audible.com/twit2.
[01:38:54.120 --> 01:38:55.920]   That's the platinum account.
[01:38:55.920 --> 01:38:58.160]   Now platinum means you get two books a month.
[01:38:58.160 --> 01:38:59.840]   I think that's about right, by the way.
[01:38:59.840 --> 01:39:01.840]   I'm a platinum guy.
[01:39:01.840 --> 01:39:04.280]   But the first months for your first two books are free.
[01:39:04.280 --> 01:39:06.400]   You can cancel it anytime, so they're yours to keep forever.
[01:39:06.400 --> 01:39:09.200]   It doesn't have to cost you a penny.
[01:39:09.200 --> 01:39:12.600]   I think let's start off with Lucifer's hammer.
[01:39:12.600 --> 01:39:18.160]   Then maybe add the Moten God's Eye, another great Jerry Parnell Larry Niven book.
[01:39:18.160 --> 01:39:22.600]   There's just so many wonderful books at Audible, over 100,000 titles now.
[01:39:22.600 --> 01:39:24.360]   And I think you want to give them a try.
[01:39:24.360 --> 01:39:26.560]   If you like to listen, these books come to life.
[01:39:26.560 --> 01:39:30.400]   And books like these, I feel like I've seen the movie of Lucifer's hammer.
[01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:33.280]   Your brain just renders it, and it's fantastic.
[01:39:33.280 --> 01:39:39.000]   By the way, Leo, Star Swarm is a young adult.
[01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.720]   And your kids might like it.
[01:39:41.720 --> 01:39:47.040]   I'm trying to get Henry into sci-fi.
[01:39:47.040 --> 01:39:49.280]   Like a lot of boys, he's not a big reader.
[01:39:49.280 --> 01:39:53.680]   My daughter, she'd come home from the bookstore with a stack this high and loves your stuff,
[01:39:53.680 --> 01:39:54.680]   by the way.
[01:39:54.680 --> 01:39:55.680]   She loves sci-fi.
[01:39:55.680 --> 01:40:01.440]   And for Christmas, I gave him Heinlein, stranger and a strange, I said, "These are the two books
[01:40:01.440 --> 01:40:02.680]   you have to read.
[01:40:02.680 --> 01:40:03.880]   Stranger and a strange land."
[01:40:03.880 --> 01:40:06.440]   And William Gibson's neuro-mancer.
[01:40:06.440 --> 01:40:09.520]   And my daughter said, "Daddy, why don't you give those to me?"
[01:40:09.520 --> 01:40:12.280]   I have to get another copy for her.
[01:40:12.280 --> 01:40:15.920]   But I feel like science fiction is a great way to get kids reading.
[01:40:15.920 --> 01:40:20.920]   And not to put down Gibson, but I think Star Swarm is more accessible for people who are
[01:40:20.920 --> 01:40:22.720]   not science fiction writers.
[01:40:22.720 --> 01:40:23.720]   Right.
[01:40:23.720 --> 01:40:24.720]   I mean, readers.
[01:40:24.720 --> 01:40:25.720]   Yeah, no, I agree.
[01:40:25.720 --> 01:40:29.800]   Neuro-mancer is a heavy-going book.
[01:40:29.800 --> 01:40:30.800]   I will get him Star Swarm.
[01:40:30.800 --> 01:40:31.800]   That's great.
[01:40:31.800 --> 01:40:32.800]   Thank you, Jerry.
[01:40:32.800 --> 01:40:33.800]   Good recommendation.
[01:40:33.800 --> 01:40:34.800]   Audible.com/twit2.
[01:40:34.800 --> 01:40:37.280]   Give it a try.
[01:40:37.280 --> 01:40:40.640]   They also, once you're a member, they do a lot of stuff for free.
[01:40:40.640 --> 01:40:43.840]   First chapters, so you can hear stuff.
[01:40:43.840 --> 01:40:49.960]   They do political stuff like the debates, speeches.
[01:40:49.960 --> 01:40:55.080]   There's a George R.R. Martin story with Morning Comes Mist Fall that's available for free.
[01:40:55.080 --> 01:40:57.600]   That was almost his first story.
[01:40:57.600 --> 01:40:58.600]   Really?
[01:40:58.600 --> 01:41:03.640]   I remember when it first came out in analog a very long time ago.
[01:41:03.640 --> 01:41:04.640]   Yeah.
[01:41:04.640 --> 01:41:06.080]   What do you think of the Song of Ice and Fire?
[01:41:06.080 --> 01:41:07.680]   I mean, it's not sci-fi.
[01:41:07.680 --> 01:41:09.360]   It's more fantasy.
[01:41:09.360 --> 01:41:11.640]   Do you like Georges and stuff?
[01:41:11.640 --> 01:41:12.640]   I just love it.
[01:41:12.640 --> 01:41:13.640]   I think they did it.
[01:41:13.640 --> 01:41:15.400]   He's a very good writer.
[01:41:15.400 --> 01:41:18.080]   Oh, he's wonderful.
[01:41:18.080 --> 01:41:22.760]   And if you like the sorts of things he writes about, then you will like him.
[01:41:22.760 --> 01:41:23.760]   It's really that simple.
[01:41:23.760 --> 01:41:24.760]   Yeah.
[01:41:24.760 --> 01:41:28.480]   If you like the genre, yeah, it's not hard sci-fi, which is what Jerry does, which is
[01:41:28.480 --> 01:41:31.520]   what I really love.
[01:41:31.520 --> 01:41:33.200]   Here's something you guys will be interested in.
[01:41:33.200 --> 01:41:34.880]   It's the Commodore 64.
[01:41:34.880 --> 01:41:36.800]   It just turned 30.
[01:41:36.800 --> 01:41:37.960]   They still sell those?
[01:41:37.960 --> 01:41:38.960]   No.
[01:41:38.960 --> 01:41:39.960]   No.
[01:41:39.960 --> 01:41:40.960]   Actually, they do.
[01:41:40.960 --> 01:41:45.840]   They took the original forms and they're making, they're putting a PC in there.
[01:41:45.840 --> 01:41:46.840]   Oh, yeah?
[01:41:46.840 --> 01:41:49.280]   Yeah, you could buy a Commodore 64 with a PC in it.
[01:41:49.280 --> 01:41:50.280]   How much?
[01:41:50.280 --> 01:41:52.280]   Don't you have one, John?
[01:41:52.280 --> 01:41:53.840]   Commodore 64 with a PC in it?
[01:41:53.840 --> 01:41:55.280]   No, I don't think he has that.
[01:41:55.280 --> 01:41:56.280]   I wish.
[01:41:56.280 --> 01:41:57.280]   Yeah.
[01:41:57.280 --> 01:42:03.280]   They made it debut at the Consumer Electronics Show 30 years ago.
[01:42:03.280 --> 01:42:04.840]   Wow.
[01:42:04.840 --> 01:42:05.840]   I don't know.
[01:42:05.840 --> 01:42:06.920]   I'll have to look and see.
[01:42:06.920 --> 01:42:08.440]   You can get a C64 on a chip.
[01:42:08.440 --> 01:42:13.160]   In fact, Jerry Ellsworth gave me a joystick that has a Commodore 64 in it.
[01:42:13.160 --> 01:42:14.160]   Yeah.
[01:42:14.160 --> 01:42:15.160]   And a joystick with a Commodore 64?
[01:42:15.160 --> 01:42:16.160]   Yeah.
[01:42:16.160 --> 01:42:17.160]   It's got a, it could fit in it.
[01:42:17.160 --> 01:42:21.160]   And actually, she was very clever because the original idea of this joystick was just
[01:42:21.160 --> 01:42:22.160]   some games.
[01:42:22.160 --> 01:42:23.760]   It was like eight games in one.
[01:42:23.760 --> 01:42:27.040]   She, when she designed the logic, she wrote a backdoor.
[01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:31.480]   If you do this thing, with a joystick, it opens up the C64.
[01:42:31.480 --> 01:42:32.880]   You've got the whole C64 ROM.
[01:42:32.880 --> 01:42:35.000]   You've got basically, you've got the whole thing.
[01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:38.360]   And originally, the guys she made it for, the Chinese firm that she made it for, they
[01:42:38.360 --> 01:42:40.680]   were furious that she put this backdoor in it.
[01:42:40.680 --> 01:42:45.080]   And then, of course, the thing sold out like that because all these Commodore 64, you
[01:42:45.080 --> 01:42:46.080]   see it said, wait a minute.
[01:42:46.080 --> 01:42:48.480]   I don't know why people get upset about stuff like that.
[01:42:48.480 --> 01:42:49.480]   So silly.
[01:42:49.480 --> 01:42:50.480]   Yeah.
[01:42:50.480 --> 01:42:51.880]   Rupert Murdoch is on Twitter.
[01:42:51.880 --> 01:42:53.040]   Yeah, supposedly.
[01:42:53.040 --> 01:42:55.080]   No, no, Twitter verified it.
[01:42:55.080 --> 01:42:58.560]   And Jack, there was a fraud verification recently on Twitter.
[01:42:58.560 --> 01:43:00.360]   And I've never been verified.
[01:43:00.360 --> 01:43:01.360]   You're not verified?
[01:43:01.360 --> 01:43:02.600]   No, they won't verify me.
[01:43:02.600 --> 01:43:06.560]   Well, gish, I'm a real devorec everybody at the real devorec.
[01:43:06.560 --> 01:43:07.560]   And you're not verified?
[01:43:07.560 --> 01:43:08.560]   I'm not verified that.
[01:43:08.560 --> 01:43:12.200]   And I've asked for it a couple of times because there's a couple of fakes on there.
[01:43:12.200 --> 01:43:13.200]   But nope.
[01:43:13.200 --> 01:43:14.920]   Well, I think because it's the real devorec.
[01:43:14.920 --> 01:43:15.920]   Because I know you.
[01:43:15.920 --> 01:43:19.680]   No, there's plenty of weird names that have been verified with the other name underneath
[01:43:19.680 --> 01:43:20.680]   it.
[01:43:20.680 --> 01:43:22.840]   Is Twittering worth doing?
[01:43:22.840 --> 01:43:24.280]   You're still not Twittering?
[01:43:24.280 --> 01:43:25.280]   No, I don't.
[01:43:25.280 --> 01:43:26.280]   Twitter.
[01:43:26.280 --> 01:43:29.120]   It's a good from, well, I'll.
[01:43:29.120 --> 01:43:30.680]   Is Twitter a verb?
[01:43:30.680 --> 01:43:31.920]   He doesn't Twitter.
[01:43:31.920 --> 01:43:35.080]   Tweet, it is not worth doing.
[01:43:35.080 --> 01:43:36.080]   No, I agree.
[01:43:36.080 --> 01:43:37.520]   It's not worth doing.
[01:43:37.520 --> 01:43:42.840]   It is worth following tweets because Twitter turns out to be a very good signaling.
[01:43:42.840 --> 01:43:44.600]   I got a new one to follow.
[01:43:44.600 --> 01:43:45.600]   You got to follow this.
[01:43:45.600 --> 01:43:47.160]   Everyone's got to follow this one.
[01:43:47.160 --> 01:43:48.160]   Who?
[01:43:48.160 --> 01:43:49.160]   G.S.
[01:43:49.160 --> 01:43:50.160]   elevator.
[01:43:50.160 --> 01:43:51.160]   Goldman Sachs elevator.
[01:43:51.160 --> 01:43:55.640]   It's a guy who collects and you have to email them the overheard thoughts and concepts
[01:43:55.640 --> 01:43:59.320]   that are expressed on the Goldman Sachs elevators around the world.
[01:43:59.320 --> 01:44:00.320]   Do you think it's actually real?
[01:44:00.320 --> 01:44:02.600]   If you start reading them, I read it for an hour last night.
[01:44:02.600 --> 01:44:04.320]   I went real deep into it.
[01:44:04.320 --> 01:44:05.920]   I think half of them are real.
[01:44:05.920 --> 01:44:07.480]   Oh my God.
[01:44:07.480 --> 01:44:11.360]   I think this one, it's sweet how my wife thinks this silent treatment is a punishment.
[01:44:11.360 --> 01:44:17.640]   It just is the kind of thing that you would hear on the elevator at a Goldman Sachs office.
[01:44:17.640 --> 01:44:21.720]   Rules are for the obedience of fools and the guidance of people like us.
[01:44:21.720 --> 01:44:26.200]   What's that one you may just have talked me into?
[01:44:26.200 --> 01:44:27.200]   Twitter.
[01:44:27.200 --> 01:44:33.720]   No, but this is Twitter is, you know, you can use Twitter to broadcast stuff and I use
[01:44:33.720 --> 01:44:37.240]   it for links and stuff and communicate with fans and stuff.
[01:44:37.240 --> 01:44:39.000]   But it's not really a great medium.
[01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.960]   I think Google+, or Facebook is probably better for that kind of thing.
[01:44:41.960 --> 01:44:45.280]   But what Twitter is great is it's signaling what people are talking about.
[01:44:45.280 --> 01:44:48.720]   It's a, and then occasionally there's funny things like G.S. elevator gossip.
[01:44:48.720 --> 01:44:50.440]   They're just funny to read.
[01:44:50.440 --> 01:44:51.440]   Yeah, I know it's hilarious.
[01:44:51.440 --> 01:44:52.480]   I'm following it right now.
[01:44:52.480 --> 01:44:53.480]   You should.
[01:44:53.480 --> 01:44:55.360]   It's irresistible.
[01:44:55.360 --> 01:44:58.960]   The problem is I follow like 1,500 people so it's just going to get buried.
[01:44:58.960 --> 01:45:02.360]   Another one that I, well you can go back and look at them every so often, but the one
[01:45:02.360 --> 01:45:07.080]   I'm getting a kick out of currently is Keith Olberman because apparently what I do when
[01:45:07.080 --> 01:45:10.920]   it, when people are like, whatever, being snarky way, that's a long story.
[01:45:10.920 --> 01:45:14.760]   But when people are being snarky with each other, generally speaking, you can just ban
[01:45:14.760 --> 01:45:16.320]   them because you don't need it.
[01:45:16.320 --> 01:45:17.880]   He encourages it.
[01:45:17.880 --> 01:45:19.840]   So he's cussing people out.
[01:45:19.840 --> 01:45:21.320]   He's calling them a-holes.
[01:45:21.320 --> 01:45:23.640]   That's actually a good strategy.
[01:45:23.640 --> 01:45:26.040]   He's getting into beefs with everybody.
[01:45:26.040 --> 01:45:27.440]   It's hilarious.
[01:45:27.440 --> 01:45:29.840]   That's actually a great strategy.
[01:45:29.840 --> 01:45:31.040]   One way to do that.
[01:45:31.040 --> 01:45:35.320]   So I think Jerry, you don't need to tweet, but you probably should have a Twitter account
[01:45:35.320 --> 01:45:38.760]   and follow some people because you can get some really interesting stuff.
[01:45:38.760 --> 01:45:40.240]   It can be entertaining.
[01:45:40.240 --> 01:45:41.240]   Yeah.
[01:45:41.240 --> 01:45:43.240]   When do you find the time?
[01:45:43.240 --> 01:45:44.240]   Well I'm not a writer, Jerry.
[01:45:44.240 --> 01:45:46.440]   I don't actually work for a living, so I don't have to do it.
[01:45:46.440 --> 01:45:49.240]   He actually, Leo probably works harder than the two of us combined.
[01:45:49.240 --> 01:45:50.240]   Oh, it's not true.
[01:45:50.240 --> 01:45:51.240]   Yeah, well I think so.
[01:45:51.240 --> 01:45:52.240]   Oh yeah, absolutely.
[01:45:52.240 --> 01:45:54.640]   I write a couple hours a day, but I really can't let you go.
[01:45:54.640 --> 01:45:55.640]   Yeah, writers only work two hours a day.
[01:45:55.640 --> 01:45:56.640]   Really?
[01:45:56.640 --> 01:45:57.640]   Is that true?
[01:45:57.640 --> 01:45:58.640]   Yeah.
[01:45:58.640 --> 01:45:59.640]   Maybe I should be a writer.
[01:45:59.640 --> 01:46:00.640]   Too late.
[01:46:00.640 --> 01:46:02.520]   I'm going to read that guy and become a writer.
[01:46:02.520 --> 01:46:03.520]   Jack Woodford.
[01:46:03.520 --> 01:46:04.520]   Jack Woodford, yeah.
[01:46:04.520 --> 01:46:06.520]   Maybe I'll get his books again now.
[01:46:06.520 --> 01:46:10.800]   You've made him a celebrity.
[01:46:10.800 --> 01:46:14.920]   Warner Brothers will make Netflix Red Block, Red Box and Blockbuster wait longer for new
[01:46:14.920 --> 01:46:15.920]   movies.
[01:46:15.920 --> 01:46:18.240]   This is part of that content battle.
[01:46:18.240 --> 01:46:21.640]   Warner Brothers doesn't like it that you can rent these movies.
[01:46:21.640 --> 01:46:26.440]   They want you to buy them or pay the expensive video on demand fees.
[01:46:26.440 --> 01:46:31.000]   So the new deal between Time Warner and Netflix Red Blocks and Blockbuster is going to double
[01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:32.000]   the window for new releases.
[01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.880]   It used to be 30 days after DVD sales.
[01:46:34.880 --> 01:46:40.640]   Now you have to wait 56 days after DVD sales instead of 28 days.
[01:46:40.640 --> 01:46:41.880]   Well, that's not good.
[01:46:41.880 --> 01:46:44.720]   That's not good.
[01:46:44.720 --> 01:46:47.120]   Did I mention that movie Hugo 3D?
[01:46:47.120 --> 01:46:48.120]   Did you like that?
[01:46:48.120 --> 01:46:49.120]   Did you see it?
[01:46:49.120 --> 01:46:50.120]   Yeah.
[01:46:50.120 --> 01:46:51.120]   You didn't like it?
[01:46:51.120 --> 01:46:52.120]   No.
[01:46:52.120 --> 01:46:53.120]   Oh, but that's what you don't have.
[01:46:53.120 --> 01:46:54.120]   You have the...
[01:46:54.120 --> 01:46:55.120]   I can see 3D if I like kind of like Reliance.
[01:46:55.120 --> 01:46:56.960]   Yeah, it's not the same.
[01:46:56.960 --> 01:46:57.960]   The point is...
[01:46:57.960 --> 01:46:58.960]   You thought that 3D was good.
[01:46:58.960 --> 01:47:00.760]   That was such a waste of 3D in that movie.
[01:47:00.760 --> 01:47:03.160]   No, it was done in a totally alien way.
[01:47:03.160 --> 01:47:05.640]   No, it was an atmosphere thing.
[01:47:05.640 --> 01:47:06.640]   It was to take...
[01:47:06.640 --> 01:47:07.640]   Was it an atmosphere?
[01:47:07.640 --> 01:47:08.640]   It was background.
[01:47:08.640 --> 01:47:09.640]   Yeah.
[01:47:09.640 --> 01:47:10.640]   Yeah.
[01:47:10.640 --> 01:47:11.640]   Because I know I would take off my glasses and I would see that, well, the foreground
[01:47:11.640 --> 01:47:14.640]   is actually 2D, but all of the background stuff is in 3D.
[01:47:14.640 --> 01:47:16.560]   Yeah, Leo can't really see in 3D.
[01:47:16.560 --> 01:47:18.160]   So you mentioned this before in the show.
[01:47:18.160 --> 01:47:22.760]   You do not enjoy sitting in a theater, watching a movie that's half the luminance because
[01:47:22.760 --> 01:47:23.760]   it has to be for the thing.
[01:47:23.760 --> 01:47:25.160]   This is your personal complaint.
[01:47:25.160 --> 01:47:26.160]   This does not apply to...
[01:47:26.160 --> 01:47:28.360]   Wearing spectacles on top of your spectacle.
[01:47:28.360 --> 01:47:30.320]   This does not apply to anybody in the world.
[01:47:30.320 --> 01:47:31.320]   It's like a knit wheel.
[01:47:31.320 --> 01:47:32.320]   Except you.
[01:47:32.320 --> 01:47:33.320]   It applies to my life.
[01:47:33.320 --> 01:47:34.320]   A great movie.
[01:47:34.320 --> 01:47:36.240]   Jerry, do you like 3D movies?
[01:47:36.240 --> 01:47:37.640]   No, I hate them.
[01:47:37.640 --> 01:47:38.640]   I agree.
[01:47:38.640 --> 01:47:39.640]   Okay.
[01:47:39.640 --> 01:47:43.800]   I'm sorry I brought it up, but anyone who likes film has to see the Scorsese film in 3D.
[01:47:43.800 --> 01:47:52.180]   Yeah, I think I want to see the film, but my problem is I really have to put the glasses
[01:47:52.180 --> 01:47:54.880]   over glasses and that gives me a headache.
[01:47:54.880 --> 01:47:57.440]   Hey, you know, we're going to go to CES just a little bit.
[01:47:57.440 --> 01:47:59.680]   Before we do, though, I want to say hello to Tom Merritt.
[01:47:59.680 --> 01:48:01.880]   I think he's at CES to take a look at...
[01:48:01.880 --> 01:48:02.880]   Is this really Tom?
[01:48:02.880 --> 01:48:04.080]   Yeah, watch to see.
[01:48:04.080 --> 01:48:06.080]   He's here to watch the week ahead.
[01:48:06.080 --> 01:48:07.480]   Hey, thanks, Leo.
[01:48:07.480 --> 01:48:10.320]   You know, let me tell you, some of the things are coming up in the week ahead.
[01:48:10.320 --> 01:48:11.320]   CES.
[01:48:11.320 --> 01:48:12.320]   It's getting together right now.
[01:48:12.320 --> 01:48:15.120]   They're building it, putting all the stuff together, putting their booths up.
[01:48:15.120 --> 01:48:16.120]   It's going to be opening up.
[01:48:16.120 --> 01:48:18.080]   We're going to cover it all week long, as you know.
[01:48:18.080 --> 01:48:20.680]   Right here at the Twit booth, Russell's got the internet going.
[01:48:20.680 --> 01:48:23.000]   We're putting the lights up, getting ready for all of that.
[01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:28.160]   But there are a few notable items to point out that will be covered in the week ahead.
[01:48:28.160 --> 01:48:31.520]   Tuesday, the Consumer Electronics Show officially opens.
[01:48:31.520 --> 01:48:36.440]   Also click, formerly PMA, the photo conference is happening as part of CES.
[01:48:36.440 --> 01:48:41.040]   Razor is teasing their PC gaming all new form factor Project Fiona.
[01:48:41.040 --> 01:48:42.600]   That should be announced Tuesday as well.
[01:48:42.600 --> 01:48:47.400]   Wednesday, January 11th, the Nokia Lumia 710 goes on sale in the United States.
[01:48:47.400 --> 01:48:52.440]   Thursday, January 12th, it's happy birthday to the Hal 9000, and I can.
[01:48:52.440 --> 01:48:57.200]   Pushes ahead with its launch of new top-level domains over some people's protests.
[01:48:57.200 --> 01:49:03.320]   Friday, January 13th, a new round of iPhone releases in 22 countries around the world,
[01:49:03.320 --> 01:49:04.320]   including China.
[01:49:04.320 --> 01:49:07.760]   That and hundreds of products are what we're going to be covering.
[01:49:07.760 --> 01:49:11.640]   It's the Consumer Electronics Show 2012 coming up in the week ahead.
[01:49:11.640 --> 01:49:15.000]   Tell John, I'd love to stay in chat, but I've got to run off to CES Unveiled, the first
[01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:18.280]   press of it that we're covering tonight to kick off our coverage.
[01:49:18.280 --> 01:49:19.280]   Back to you, Leo.
[01:49:19.280 --> 01:49:22.320]   Yeah, right.
[01:49:22.320 --> 01:49:24.640]   We actually have cameras right now ready to go.
[01:49:24.640 --> 01:49:26.680]   We're going to go live to CES in just a few minutes.
[01:49:26.680 --> 01:49:36.000]   Let's just see what's going on at the big event that any minute now, we're going to
[01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:37.800]   go to any second now.
[01:49:37.800 --> 01:49:38.800]   Is Tom there?
[01:49:38.800 --> 01:49:41.800]   Maybe we can talk to him now.
[01:49:41.800 --> 01:49:43.800]   That's a very nice tablecloth.
[01:49:43.800 --> 01:49:44.800]   Uh-huh.
[01:49:44.800 --> 01:49:47.240]   That's a great shot.
[01:49:47.240 --> 01:49:48.240]   Yeah.
[01:49:48.240 --> 01:49:49.240]   This is pretty exciting.
[01:49:49.240 --> 01:49:50.240]   Yeah, I'm excited.
[01:49:50.240 --> 01:49:51.240]   I'm excited.
[01:49:51.240 --> 01:49:52.240]   You hope.
[01:49:52.240 --> 01:49:53.240]   Cook, it's Cook.
[01:49:53.240 --> 01:49:54.240]   I wouldn't.
[01:49:54.240 --> 01:49:55.240]   Yes.
[01:49:55.240 --> 01:50:03.560]   We'll let them know we're on in a moment and we'll go back to them in just a second.
[01:50:03.560 --> 01:50:06.360]   Uh, now too late.
[01:50:06.360 --> 01:50:07.360]   Sorry, sorry.
[01:50:07.360 --> 01:50:09.480]   No, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:50:09.480 --> 01:50:10.480]   Now Eileen knows right.
[01:50:10.480 --> 01:50:11.680]   Look like Eileen.
[01:50:11.680 --> 01:50:13.560]   She caught on to it.
[01:50:13.560 --> 01:50:19.880]   So a new aboard chair at the rim, but this two pathetic CEOs stay.
[01:50:19.880 --> 01:50:20.960]   The double CEOs.
[01:50:20.960 --> 01:50:22.520]   What is this with the two CEOs?
[01:50:22.520 --> 01:50:24.960]   I've seen other Qualcomm did that for a while, I think.
[01:50:24.960 --> 01:50:26.560]   Crazy, crazy.
[01:50:26.560 --> 01:50:34.000]   And apparently some are saying that rim, Nokia and Apple have all three provided the
[01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:38.840]   Indian military with, military with backdoor access to the cellular comms.
[01:50:38.840 --> 01:50:42.160]   It's coming from the India IT column at ZD net.
[01:50:42.160 --> 01:50:43.960]   Oh, Manan Kakar says.
[01:50:43.960 --> 01:50:44.960]   Isn't it good?
[01:50:44.960 --> 01:50:49.360]   In exchange for mobile presence in India, rim, Nokia and Apple have allegedly provided
[01:50:49.360 --> 01:50:55.160]   backdoor access for the Indian intelligence.
[01:50:55.160 --> 01:51:00.760]   Nobody talks much about Indian intelligence, but those guys are rough customers.
[01:51:00.760 --> 01:51:04.080]   So pretty sharp too, at least they used to be.
[01:51:04.080 --> 01:51:05.080]   Interesting.
[01:51:05.080 --> 01:51:09.160]   You know, I, we haven't talked about this and it's really more politics and technology,
[01:51:09.160 --> 01:51:11.560]   but what do you think of the national defense authorization?
[01:51:11.560 --> 01:51:12.800]   Terrible.
[01:51:12.800 --> 01:51:18.560]   I'm just scared to death that the US government can now jail anybody indefinitely without
[01:51:18.560 --> 01:51:19.560]   trial.
[01:51:19.560 --> 01:51:20.560]   Military.
[01:51:20.560 --> 01:51:21.560]   It's a militarization of the country.
[01:51:21.560 --> 01:51:25.360]   And here's the kicker that people have not talked about, which has been discussed on
[01:51:25.360 --> 01:51:27.080]   the No Agenda show.
[01:51:27.080 --> 01:51:28.480]   Noagendashow.com.
[01:51:28.480 --> 01:51:30.120]   Which, thank you.
[01:51:30.120 --> 01:51:35.520]   Which is a, which is a, another law that was passed by executive order that can take
[01:51:35.520 --> 01:51:42.080]   your citizenship away at the drop of a hat by essentially a kangaroo court.
[01:51:42.080 --> 01:51:47.760]   And then you're not an American citizen anymore and you can be jailed at Gitmo.
[01:51:47.760 --> 01:51:48.760]   This is a bill.
[01:51:48.760 --> 01:51:51.320]   This will be available to people who are on the news letter.
[01:51:51.320 --> 01:51:53.880]   And for people who say, oh, well, the government wouldn't do that.
[01:51:53.880 --> 01:51:54.880]   What do you think?
[01:51:54.880 --> 01:51:56.400]   That's what, what's the point of saying that?
[01:51:56.400 --> 01:51:57.840]   What's the point of doing it?
[01:51:57.840 --> 01:52:00.800]   Well, I think the courts have yet to be heard from.
[01:52:00.800 --> 01:52:02.800]   Well, I think that hopefully the courts will do something about this.
[01:52:02.800 --> 01:52:06.960]   I do believe habeas corpus is enshrined in the United States Constitution.
[01:52:06.960 --> 01:52:10.720]   Well, take a look at the Patriot Act and tell me what they've done about that so far.
[01:52:10.720 --> 01:52:12.880]   Well, it does not.
[01:52:12.880 --> 01:52:16.200]   Patriot Act hasn't eliminated habeas corpus.
[01:52:16.200 --> 01:52:23.000]   Lincoln eliminated habeas corpus for a while, but he was sharply restricted in his ability
[01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:26.120]   to do it even, even then.
[01:52:26.120 --> 01:52:30.480]   So I'm not, I worry about such things.
[01:52:30.480 --> 01:52:31.480]   I do indeed.
[01:52:31.480 --> 01:52:37.400]   And I particularly don't like the notion of being able to put people on prescription lists
[01:52:37.400 --> 01:52:42.120]   and just go kill them without any trial or anything else.
[01:52:42.120 --> 01:52:43.120]   It's fine.
[01:52:43.120 --> 01:52:46.120]   It's fine if you have a benign government, but the minute, you know, who knows?
[01:52:46.120 --> 01:52:47.120]   Who knows who gets elected.
[01:52:47.120 --> 01:52:48.120]   There is no such thing.
[01:52:48.120 --> 01:52:52.560]   Leo is a benign government because governments are always filled with people.
[01:52:52.560 --> 01:53:01.160]   That was one of the first things that they understood in the convention of 1787 is that
[01:53:01.160 --> 01:53:06.920]   you don't hand things over to arbitrary power just because you think this is a good guy.
[01:53:06.920 --> 01:53:07.920]   Right.
[01:53:07.920 --> 01:53:08.920]   I agree 100%.
[01:53:08.920 --> 01:53:10.080]   You do need people.
[01:53:10.080 --> 01:53:11.080]   You need people.
[01:53:11.080 --> 01:53:13.400]   And people always filled with people.
[01:53:13.400 --> 01:53:14.400]   Are greedy.
[01:53:14.400 --> 01:53:16.120]   Let me go further.
[01:53:16.120 --> 01:53:17.880]   Pronel's iron law.
[01:53:17.880 --> 01:53:21.200]   There are two kinds of organizations in this world.
[01:53:21.200 --> 01:53:25.600]   I mean, the two kinds of people in this world are in organizations.
[01:53:25.600 --> 01:53:30.520]   In every organization, there are people who are devoted to the principles that the organization
[01:53:30.520 --> 01:53:35.640]   was founded for like good classroom teachers and so forth.
[01:53:35.640 --> 01:53:41.560]   And there are people who are devoted to the organization itself, like school administrators
[01:53:41.560 --> 01:53:43.400]   and so forth.
[01:53:43.400 --> 01:53:47.280]   And the iron law is the second group always gets in control.
[01:53:47.280 --> 01:53:48.280]   All yeah, yeah.
[01:53:48.280 --> 01:53:51.800]   And the same with government.
[01:53:51.800 --> 01:53:53.800]   The bureaucrats always win.
[01:53:53.800 --> 01:53:54.800]   Yeah.
[01:53:54.800 --> 01:54:00.640]   This seems so minor compared with the right to jail somebody indefinitely without trial,
[01:54:00.640 --> 01:54:03.840]   but the government also claims they can they can close any Twitter account.
[01:54:03.840 --> 01:54:06.920]   It doesn't seem I should have done that first.
[01:54:06.920 --> 01:54:07.920]   We have not heard.
[01:54:07.920 --> 01:54:10.960]   Well, there's some Twitter accounts they should close.
[01:54:10.960 --> 01:54:11.960]   Twitter is fighting this.
[01:54:11.960 --> 01:54:12.960]   And I praise Twitter.
[01:54:12.960 --> 01:54:13.960]   It's good for them.
[01:54:13.960 --> 01:54:19.000]   Joe Lieberman contacted Twitter to remove two quote propaganda accounts run by the Taliban.
[01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:21.600]   Turns out the Taliban is not in the illegal organization.
[01:54:21.600 --> 01:54:25.320]   They're setting up shop and cutter to with offices now.
[01:54:25.320 --> 01:54:27.800]   It's not illegal in the employment with the Taliban.
[01:54:27.800 --> 01:54:28.800]   Can you imagine?
[01:54:28.800 --> 01:54:30.280]   Hey, I like to have a meeting.
[01:54:30.280 --> 01:54:33.600]   Well, I'm not crazy about them, but they're not in illegal.
[01:54:33.600 --> 01:54:36.400]   They're not al Qaeda.
[01:54:36.400 --> 01:54:40.840]   And Israeli law firm threatened to sue Twitter if they didn't remove accounts run by Hezbollah.
[01:54:40.840 --> 01:54:45.720]   And in the New York Times, an anonymous US official said they quote may have the legal
[01:54:45.720 --> 01:54:49.840]   authority to demand that Twitter close a Twitter account associated with the militant
[01:54:49.840 --> 01:54:50.840]   Somali group.
[01:54:50.840 --> 01:54:52.760]   It's actually an interesting pirates.
[01:54:52.760 --> 01:54:55.360]   No, it should be a pirate group.
[01:54:55.360 --> 01:54:56.360]   Al Shabaab.
[01:54:56.360 --> 01:54:57.360]   Yeah, Al Shabaab.
[01:54:57.360 --> 01:54:58.360]   Those guys are bad.
[01:54:58.360 --> 01:54:59.360]   They should be pirates.
[01:54:59.360 --> 01:55:05.080]   Hey, now maybe the pirates could get together with the with the with the with the with the
[01:55:05.080 --> 01:55:07.080]   entertainment pirates.
[01:55:07.080 --> 01:55:09.080]   Now you're talking.
[01:55:09.080 --> 01:55:11.080]   We should have a priority.
[01:55:11.080 --> 01:55:12.920]   We should have a convention.
[01:55:12.920 --> 01:55:20.320]   Our servers on on captured ships that are anchored off of the coast of Somalia and pirate
[01:55:20.320 --> 01:55:21.320]   radio.
[01:55:21.320 --> 01:55:24.120]   So the football game's over.
[01:55:24.120 --> 01:55:25.120]   Who won?
[01:55:25.120 --> 01:55:26.120]   Denver.
[01:55:26.120 --> 01:55:27.120]   You're kidding.
[01:55:27.120 --> 01:55:28.120]   Denver was Steelers lost.
[01:55:28.120 --> 01:55:29.120]   Yes.
[01:55:29.120 --> 01:55:30.120]   Who would have thunk it?
[01:55:30.120 --> 01:55:31.120]   And they won.
[01:55:31.120 --> 01:55:35.560]   They won an overtime with an 80 yard bomb from TBO.
[01:55:35.560 --> 01:55:36.560]   I'm sorry.
[01:55:36.560 --> 01:55:37.560]   I missed this.
[01:55:37.560 --> 01:55:42.040]   First thing about the game was was in control by Denver except for the from most of the game.
[01:55:42.040 --> 01:55:43.840]   They were kicking their butts.
[01:55:43.840 --> 01:55:44.840]   Fascinating.
[01:55:44.840 --> 01:55:45.840]   Yeah.
[01:55:45.840 --> 01:55:49.000]   Well, if any betters out there you made out on this one's what was the spread?
[01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:51.760]   I think they were the dunderdosh by 10 points or something like that.
[01:55:51.760 --> 01:55:54.400]   They won 29 23.
[01:55:54.400 --> 01:55:56.040]   Let me ask and then we're going to wrap this up.
[01:55:56.040 --> 01:55:59.200]   I know you're both ardent Republicans.
[01:55:59.200 --> 01:56:01.480]   If you if I'm an independent.
[01:56:01.480 --> 01:56:02.840]   I hate to tell you that.
[01:56:02.840 --> 01:56:03.840]   No, I know you are.
[01:56:03.840 --> 01:56:04.840]   I'm just teasing.
[01:56:04.840 --> 01:56:05.840]   I do like Ron Paul.
[01:56:05.840 --> 01:56:07.040]   Ron Paul, are you Ron Paul support?
[01:56:07.040 --> 01:56:08.040]   I'm just asking.
[01:56:08.040 --> 01:56:09.040]   Yes.
[01:56:09.040 --> 01:56:10.040]   Okay.
[01:56:10.040 --> 01:56:13.000]   Jerry, do you have a horse in this race?
[01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:19.880]   I go along with the notion that anybody on that stage has got to be better than what
[01:56:19.880 --> 01:56:20.880]   we have.
[01:56:20.880 --> 01:56:23.760]   But that's my my personal view.
[01:56:23.760 --> 01:56:27.160]   You all know that Newt Gingrich is a very old friend of mine.
[01:56:27.160 --> 01:56:28.160]   I did not know that.
[01:56:28.160 --> 01:56:31.160]   I'm not in the first time I ever met.
[01:56:31.160 --> 01:56:37.640]   Newt was my phone rang in 1980 or thereabouts and this voice said this is Newt Gingrich.
[01:56:37.640 --> 01:56:39.040]   I'd never heard of him.
[01:56:39.040 --> 01:56:44.680]   He had read my book a step farther out and he had called the publisher and got my name
[01:56:44.680 --> 01:56:47.120]   and phone number and called me to talk about it.
[01:56:47.120 --> 01:56:52.400]   Now I haven't had too many congressmen want to call up and discuss concepts of science
[01:56:52.400 --> 01:56:53.880]   and so forth.
[01:56:53.880 --> 01:56:58.280]   So I was kind of his science advisor up to the time he became speaker.
[01:56:58.280 --> 01:56:59.280]   Wow.
[01:56:59.280 --> 01:57:05.600]   He's a personal friend and you'd make out like abandoned if he was president.
[01:57:05.600 --> 01:57:06.600]   We all would.
[01:57:06.600 --> 01:57:13.480]   No, I think Jerry should have a seat on the cabinet.
[01:57:13.480 --> 01:57:17.760]   We can make the make him the Minister of Space.
[01:57:17.760 --> 01:57:23.280]   Actually what I would like to see is Newt as a postmaster general and don't laugh.
[01:57:23.280 --> 01:57:29.040]   I meant by that the way the postmaster general used to be which was the fifth ranking cabinet
[01:57:29.040 --> 01:57:34.520]   officer and he basically was the minister without portfolio.
[01:57:34.520 --> 01:57:39.960]   That was traditionally for a long time in this country the postmaster general was the
[01:57:39.960 --> 01:57:42.320]   chief advisor to the president.
[01:57:42.320 --> 01:57:45.600]   What he wasn't expected to run the post office.
[01:57:45.600 --> 01:57:48.600]   Well I think somebody running the post office isn't a bad idea either.
[01:57:48.600 --> 01:57:50.320]   Yeah the post office is a mess.
[01:57:50.320 --> 01:57:53.600]   Roosevelt used the postmaster general office that way.
[01:57:53.600 --> 01:57:55.680]   I'd love to see Newt in that office.
[01:57:55.680 --> 01:57:58.840]   Newt Gingrich for postmaster general.
[01:57:58.840 --> 01:58:01.480]   I understand that sounds ridiculous.
[01:58:01.480 --> 01:58:02.480]   He's a smart man.
[01:58:02.480 --> 01:58:03.680]   There's no doubt about that.
[01:58:03.680 --> 01:58:05.920]   As somebody you have to listen to.
[01:58:05.920 --> 01:58:07.560]   Yeah he's a smart man.
[01:58:07.560 --> 01:58:08.560]   He's a good debater.
[01:58:08.560 --> 01:58:09.560]   He's a master.
[01:58:09.560 --> 01:58:10.560]   He's a master.
[01:58:10.560 --> 01:58:16.720]   Well not only a master, Newt's problem is that he surrounds himself with smart people.
[01:58:16.720 --> 01:58:21.080]   So he doesn't mind saying something that's fairly silly on the grounds that the people
[01:58:21.080 --> 01:58:24.280]   around him are going to say Newt you're crazy.
[01:58:24.280 --> 01:58:28.000]   And by the way they are saying that I think it's a matter of that.
[01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.080]   He does that every now and then.
[01:58:30.080 --> 01:58:32.920]   He does say silly things.
[01:58:32.920 --> 01:58:37.160]   And he basically expects his friends to correct him for it.
[01:58:37.160 --> 01:58:42.280]   But it sure as hell gets out in public that oh Newt just did something stupid.
[01:58:42.280 --> 01:58:43.280]   Well probably.
[01:58:43.280 --> 01:58:49.280]   You know the truth is I like your idea because I do think Newt is a brilliant guy and probably
[01:58:49.280 --> 01:58:53.080]   would bring a lot of interesting thoughts and ideas to the table.
[01:58:53.080 --> 01:58:56.800]   But I don't think he should be an administrator but make him a postmaster general.
[01:58:56.800 --> 01:58:58.520]   So he has a minister without portfolio.
[01:58:58.520 --> 01:59:00.000]   Those days are over.
[01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:04.640]   Yeah those days are over but they are post like that still.
[01:59:04.640 --> 01:59:10.120]   You will understand that well Newt has no administrative experience as such except for
[01:59:10.120 --> 01:59:11.200]   once.
[01:59:11.200 --> 01:59:16.080]   As the speaker of the house he did reorganize the architect of the capital's office and he
[01:59:16.080 --> 01:59:17.320]   actually made it work.
[01:59:17.320 --> 01:59:22.360]   He managed to get the capital building back under decent management when he was speaker.
[01:59:22.360 --> 01:59:23.680]   It's not generally known.
[01:59:23.680 --> 01:59:25.320]   So he does have some.
[01:59:25.320 --> 01:59:28.280]   Now that's not a lot of executive experience.
[01:59:28.280 --> 01:59:29.280]   Right.
[01:59:29.280 --> 01:59:30.280]   That is his.
[01:59:30.280 --> 01:59:33.480]   I don't think Newt should be in charge of anything.
[01:59:33.480 --> 01:59:34.480]   Yeah.
[01:59:34.480 --> 01:59:35.480]   I'm not pushing him for.
[01:59:35.480 --> 01:59:38.120]   He's not going to be either so I would really not.
[01:59:38.120 --> 01:59:39.120]   He's not going to be.
[01:59:39.120 --> 01:59:40.120]   I'll grant you that.
[01:59:40.120 --> 01:59:41.120]   I don't think he will be in charge.
[01:59:41.120 --> 01:59:43.640]   But you're right I'm not sure who should be in charge.
[01:59:43.640 --> 01:59:44.640]   Selectable.
[01:59:44.640 --> 01:59:46.600]   Jerry Pournell is the greatest.
[01:59:46.600 --> 01:59:48.320]   I just love having you on the show.
[01:59:48.320 --> 01:59:50.440]   I don't know why we've been so long without you.
[01:59:50.440 --> 01:59:52.440]   Come back real soon.
[01:59:52.440 --> 01:59:53.440]   All right.
[01:59:53.440 --> 01:59:54.440]   You're the best.
[01:59:54.440 --> 01:59:55.440]   I'll be glad to.
[01:59:55.440 --> 01:59:56.440]   Jerry Pournell dot com.
[01:59:56.440 --> 02:00:00.520]   That's the place for you want people to go to to buy your stuff to see your writing and
[02:00:00.520 --> 02:00:02.480]   all that stuff.
[02:00:02.480 --> 02:00:03.480]   Yes.
[02:00:03.480 --> 02:00:04.480]   Yes.
[02:00:04.480 --> 02:00:05.480]   Yes.
[02:00:05.480 --> 02:00:06.480]   Jerry Pournell dot com.
[02:00:06.480 --> 02:00:14.320]   That's that's where I do a sort of mostly daily commentary and I can't wait to see where
[02:00:14.320 --> 02:00:15.760]   to find everything else.
[02:00:15.760 --> 02:00:19.040]   Is there any ETA for the new book?
[02:00:19.040 --> 02:00:20.920]   I'm still working on it.
[02:00:20.920 --> 02:00:25.040]   It's essentially a fairy tale on how to run the country right.
[02:00:25.040 --> 02:00:26.600]   I would always.
[02:00:26.600 --> 02:00:30.400]   Is it a political book?
[02:00:30.400 --> 02:00:37.520]   Let's say that if there's a big threat to the earth from a black comet's coming and
[02:00:37.520 --> 02:00:42.640]   the military has got to do something about it and you got 20 or 30 years.
[02:00:42.640 --> 02:00:47.080]   One of the things that you have to do is make sure there's a continuing supply of people
[02:00:47.080 --> 02:00:48.960]   who know what they're doing.
[02:00:48.960 --> 02:00:54.240]   Steve Jobs famously said that the reason he didn't make Apple computers in the United
[02:00:54.240 --> 02:00:59.920]   States is because there weren't enough quality control engineers and the kind of skilled
[02:00:59.920 --> 02:01:02.840]   people that he thought you needed to do it.
[02:01:02.840 --> 02:01:07.880]   Now that may or may not be correct but it would be correct in the case that we're doing.
[02:01:07.880 --> 02:01:10.000]   So we're doing basically a fairy tale.
[02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:15.920]   If you had to run the country with a disaster coming what would you do to reform the schools?
[02:01:15.920 --> 02:01:17.360]   Interesting.
[02:01:17.360 --> 02:01:18.960]   Make everything different.
[02:01:18.960 --> 02:01:20.640]   Not a fairy tale.
[02:01:20.640 --> 02:01:25.080]   That's all great science fiction starts with the premise and then runs with it and I can't
[02:01:25.080 --> 02:01:26.080]   wait to read it.
[02:01:26.080 --> 02:01:27.080]   It sounds great.
[02:01:27.080 --> 02:01:29.440]   Do you have a name for it yet?
[02:01:29.440 --> 02:01:33.080]   Lucifer's Anvil is the work is the working.
[02:01:33.080 --> 02:01:34.400]   So it's kind of...
[02:01:34.400 --> 02:01:36.240]   We may or may not change that.
[02:01:36.240 --> 02:01:37.240]   I like that.
[02:01:37.240 --> 02:01:41.080]   Look, the most lucrative thing I ever did in my life was he hit the earth with something
[02:01:41.080 --> 02:01:42.080]   great big.
[02:01:42.080 --> 02:01:44.400]   So we've done it twice.
[02:01:44.400 --> 02:01:49.920]   We made a lot of money each time so I thought it's probably time to do it again.
[02:01:49.920 --> 02:01:51.040]   If it works do it again.
[02:01:51.040 --> 02:01:53.040]   I think Woodford said that right?
[02:01:53.040 --> 02:01:54.040]   Maybe.
[02:01:54.040 --> 02:01:58.360]   John C. Devorek is a channeled Devorek and of course he's the host with Adam Curry at
[02:01:58.360 --> 02:02:03.200]   the NOAA agenda show every Sunday morning and Thursday and Thursday's too.
[02:02:03.200 --> 02:02:05.360]   And you also do the five...
[02:02:05.360 --> 02:02:06.360]   What is it called?
[02:02:06.360 --> 02:02:12.200]   I do the X3 show, X3 show.me, a comic, PC magazine, call on...
[02:02:12.200 --> 02:02:13.800]   You still have the PC magazine?
[02:02:13.800 --> 02:02:14.800]   What do you even bother with that?
[02:02:14.800 --> 02:02:15.800]   I do the...
[02:02:15.800 --> 02:02:17.280]   There isn't even any print anymore.
[02:02:17.280 --> 02:02:20.040]   Every day of the week I write a call for PC magazine.
[02:02:20.040 --> 02:02:21.040]   You do?
[02:02:21.040 --> 02:02:22.040]   Yeah.
[02:02:22.040 --> 02:02:23.040]   Lord, you work harder than I do.
[02:02:23.040 --> 02:02:27.400]   Lord, hey, God, nothing else to do but write and research.
[02:02:27.400 --> 02:02:28.920]   John will be back soon.
[02:02:28.920 --> 02:02:31.480]   We asked John to be on every show but he has a limit.
[02:02:31.480 --> 02:02:32.720]   No, I don't have a limit.
[02:02:32.720 --> 02:02:33.720]   It's a long drive.
[02:02:33.720 --> 02:02:34.720]   There's only so much you can tell.
[02:02:34.720 --> 02:02:38.200]   When the weather's like this I love coming up here.
[02:02:38.200 --> 02:02:39.200]   Thanks for being here, John.
[02:02:39.200 --> 02:02:47.080]   We also had Dwight Silverman who had to leave early at the Houston Chronicle blog.tech.com/techblog.
[02:02:47.080 --> 02:02:49.760]   We are going to go live now to CES coverage.
[02:02:49.760 --> 02:02:50.600]   We will be back.
[02:02:50.600 --> 02:02:52.320]   Our schedule is a little different.
[02:02:52.320 --> 02:02:56.640]   I encourage you to go to inside.twit.tv to see what the schedule will be this week.
[02:02:56.640 --> 02:03:01.360]   We're doing security now at 9 a.m. on Monday.
[02:03:01.360 --> 02:03:04.800]   And this week in Google 11 a.m. on they both time specific so that we can get those shows
[02:03:04.800 --> 02:03:07.120]   in the can before I head to Vegas.
[02:03:07.120 --> 02:03:13.160]   We will have non-stop coverage of CES beginning Tuesday but we are going to be there tonight
[02:03:13.160 --> 02:03:14.320]   and tomorrow night.
[02:03:14.320 --> 02:03:17.760]   And we are also doing something we haven't done before.
[02:03:17.760 --> 02:03:24.280]   We are going to live stream Steve Ballmer's last keynote at CES because I'm of the opinion
[02:03:24.280 --> 02:03:26.360]   that Microsoft is going to go out with a bang.
[02:03:26.360 --> 02:03:28.320]   Is he going to come out of a cake?
[02:03:28.320 --> 02:03:30.240]   I said he's flying on a wire.
[02:03:30.240 --> 02:03:31.240]   That could be.
[02:03:31.240 --> 02:03:32.240]   It's risky.
[02:03:32.240 --> 02:03:33.720]   Didn't he do that once and then got stuck?
[02:03:33.720 --> 02:03:34.720]   I don't, maybe that was a good idea.
[02:03:34.720 --> 02:03:37.040]   I think you're thinking of somebody did that.
[02:03:37.040 --> 02:03:38.600]   Some rock and roll singer.
[02:03:38.600 --> 02:03:45.560]   Anyway, we will that starts at 6.30 p.m. Pacific tomorrow and we are going to have commentary
[02:03:45.560 --> 02:03:51.600]   from our Windows weekly host Mary Jo Foley and Paul Therat as Ballmer does the last Microsoft
[02:03:51.600 --> 02:03:52.760]   keynote at CES.
[02:03:52.760 --> 02:03:56.000]   So that should be that should be something worth watching.
[02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:57.520]   Lots of CES coverage coming up.
[02:03:57.520 --> 02:04:01.200]   We'll be back next week here in studio with Twit as always.
[02:04:01.200 --> 02:04:04.600]   Sunday's 3 p.m. Pacific's 6 p.m. Eastern on twit.tv.
[02:04:04.600 --> 02:04:08.560]   Thanks for watching and we'll see you at CES.
[02:04:08.560 --> 02:04:10.000]   Another Twit is in the can.
[02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:11.280]   This is amazing.

[02:04:13.860 --> 02:04:16.440]   (upbeat music)
