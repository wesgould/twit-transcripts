[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.680]   Oh, we got a great panel today and I don't even know where to start but I'll tell you
[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.560]   what, well I'll introduce our special guest last.
[00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.320]   But you heard of John C. Dvorak at thevorak.org/blog.
[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.320]   Hello John.
[00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.520]   Hello, I'm also a Twitterer now.
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.360]   Why are you a Twitterer?
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.600]   When he started Twittering, oh I know, it's the real Dvorak by the way.
[00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.840]   So it's twitter.com/therealdivorak.
[00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.280]   You've already got 5,000 followers in a week.
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.280]   Actually, so.
[00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.640]   I'm sorry, are there fake Dvorak?
[00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.720]   Yeah, there's a John C. Dvorak that's a fake and there's another Dvorak that's a fake.
[00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.680]   So I'm the real Dvorak.
[00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.200]   And yeah, I figure I'm moving up the ladder.
[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.280]   It's not like I need to have a million people following the thing but it's kind of good
[00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.480]   to get into the point where you have enough people that you can actually solicit them
[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:00.480]   for information.
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.440]   It can be really useful.
[00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.480]   I mean it's, you know, when you get up to in the thousands, it's a broadcast meeting.
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.040]   All of a sudden you can reach a lot of people very quickly.
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.960]   I ask questions all the time on there.
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:12.960]   But you get it.
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.560]   You're doing interesting content.
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.480]   You're giving them value for their buck.
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.080]   Like others who just use it as a chat room.
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.080]   Yeah.
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.680]   Well, you know, I use it kind of as a chat room in a kind of a meta sense because people
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.800]   ask me questions and so I chat with them kind of back and forth through the replies or whatever.
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.440]   But generally speaking, when I just post, I don't post just my mundane daily life, which
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.600]   is, you know, like everybody else.
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:38.600]   I hate cheese.
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:39.600]   I'm standing.
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.040]   I hate a cheese sandwich.
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.040]   Yeah.
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.800]   You just want to see something really cool that I think they should know about.
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.760]   I'll let them know.
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.840]   Well, this is not going to be this week in Twitter.
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.280]   But everybody, that's another thing.
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.840]   I promise all these people wouldn't talk about it.
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:53.840]   I know.
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.680]   Thank you for starting it off on a high note.
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.240]   By the way, speaking of a high note, well, I'll talk about that in a second.
[00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.480]   Also here, another Twitter at Veronica.
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.400]   She's a Veronica Belmont or should I say Veronica Belmont, the new host of Tekzilla.
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.400]   Yay.
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.400]   You threw me.
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.560]   I didn't think you would do that.
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.560]   I thought, you know, when I heard you left, Mahalo, everybody said, oh, she's going to
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:13.560]   Tekzilla.
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.960]   I said, why would she do that?
[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:19.040]   She wouldn't leave Mahalo good at Tekzilla because that's kind of lateral move.
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.560]   Was it really about being in LA and stuff like that or?
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.080]   Yeah, there was a lot to it.
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:28.080]   I mean, I wanted to do more in Tek and I wanted to be in San Francisco regularly, which was
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.080]   starting to become a problem.
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.160]   But it's not just Tekzilla.
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.080]   I mean, Tekzilla is a day a week or so, a little more counting all the work that we
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.080]   put into it.
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.920]   But there will be another project that I'm announcing, hopefully soon.
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.160]   That's more my full-time job.
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.160]   Give us a hint.
[00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.120]   Mainstream media, I think?
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.120]   I can't give any hints.
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.000]   See, this is my supposition was she's not going to leave Mahalo to go to Tekzilla.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   That's lateral.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   She's going to take a mainstream job.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   She's going to CNN.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.840]   No, it's not CNN.
[00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.440]   It's not really a mainstream thing.
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:00.440]   You'll see.
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.440]   Don't ring.
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:02.440]   Hey, Veronica, are you watching the video?
[00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.880]   Because if you are, turn it off because I think it's kind of a hit in your...
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:06.880]   I'm not actually.
[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:07.880]   Oh, okay.
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:08.880]   Is there anything else going on there?
[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.400]   Well, let me introduce the rest while we figure it out.
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.920]   Paul Therad is also here from our Windows Weekly show, the author of the Super site for
[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:15.920]   Windows, winsupearsight.com.
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:16.920]   Hey, Paul.
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:17.920]   Hey, how you doing?
[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.360]   Have we ever had you on Twitter before?
[00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:21.360]   Yeah.
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.760]   It's a long time ago.
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:24.760]   Okay.
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:25.760]   Well, it's about time.
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:26.760]   We got your back.
[00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:27.760]   Year and a half.
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:28.760]   It's a good about time.
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:29.760]   Yeah.
[00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:30.760]   I keep...
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:31.760]   I ignore your invitations.
[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:32.760]   You know, so...
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.280]   Actually, I don't see them until after it's too late.
[00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:35.280]   That's why.
[00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.720]   Well, you don't work on the weekends.
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.840]   Now let me introduce our special guest because he has been on Twitter once before.
[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.440]   We did a Twitter from the Apple Store a long time ago.
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:49.360]   Roger McGwin, the co-founder of The Birds and an absolute utter tech geek from his home
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.360]   in Florida.
[00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.360]   Hey, Roger.
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.360]   Hi.
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.360]   Hey, little deal.
[00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.960]   It was Twitch 21 and it was really a thrill.
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:55.960]   It was great.
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:00.040]   And you had the same problem back then with your multiple inputs with a Adobe audition,
[00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.040]   as I recall.
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.040]   Yeah.
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.040]   It's inevitable.
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.040]   Yeah.
[00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.040]   In fact, this is...
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.680]   As the third anniversary of Twitch, it is only fitting that we should have all sorts
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:13.120]   of technical issues because that's basically been the story of Twitch from day one.
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.840]   So is it recording all the tracks now?
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:15.840]   Yeah, we're doing fine.
[00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:16.840]   I always have a...
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.760]   I've learned one thing from these many years.
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:20.760]   Always have a backup.
[00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:24.200]   But it's not a multi-channel backup right now.
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.200]   Yeah, but you know the truth is...
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.160]   Technology will never fail us.
[00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.840]   Most of the time all we end up doing is mixing it down anyway.
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.920]   It's almost like Why bother recording it.
[00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:34.920]   Right, right.
[00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:35.920]   Multi-track.
[00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:36.920]   That's just too fancy for me.
[00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:41.320]   It would be a lot of work to take all those inputs and moderate them.
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:42.320]   Yeah.
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.960]   I used to try to do that.
[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:44.960]   That's crazy.
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:45.960]   You use the same program.
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.800]   In fact, I think you're using the new audition, right?
[00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.640]   I'm a beta tester for...
[00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.240]   I think it's out now at the audition 3.0.
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:55.240]   Right.
[00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:56.400]   And it's got some good bells and whistles.
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:00.120]   And they pretty much copied Pro Tools down the line with the movie and faders and all
[00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.120]   the good stuff.
[00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:02.120]   Oh, really?
[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:04.640]   So do you have it hooked up to a mixer with flying faders?
[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:06.360]   No, no, I don't...
[00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:07.680]   It does it on the screen.
[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:10.480]   I'm not really into having a control surface.
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:12.840]   I think that's just for the old timers who need that.
[00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:13.840]   Right.
[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.880]   And you're not an old timer.
[00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:16.880]   Not when it comes to...
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.480]   No, I'm kind of a new engineer.
[00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.040]   I used to watch the old guys, but I was never...
[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:26.880]   One time I got kicked out of the Columbia Records studio for moving a pot, doing a board
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.280]   fade and the union guys just walked out on me.
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:30.280]   They said that's it.
[00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:33.400]   I had a lot of touch the equipment.
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.040]   It's still that way in some places.
[00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:39.560]   When I do Regis and Kelly, I'm not supposed to unpack my own boxes.
[00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:45.200]   The grips come over and say, "That's a local 53's job."
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:47.680]   And you're not allowed to do so much stuff.
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:48.680]   It's really weird.
[00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:51.160]   Well, you need to sit good for some people.
[00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:56.840]   Wow, hey, I'm pro-labor, but sometimes unions do themselves in by being a little too much
[00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:59.720]   feather-bedding and a little kind of crazy.
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:02.280]   Roger has, in fact, we'll put this link on our show note.
[00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:07.760]   He has designed his own solar ice machine and they did a story on him in the local TV.
[00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:08.760]   It's really great.
[00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:10.760]   You use a solar panel to make ice.
[00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:16.040]   Right, I've got four solar panels, four deep cycle batteries and a couple of inverters and
[00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:18.200]   an ice machine that runs on this.
[00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:22.680]   The idea is that we get these hurricanes here in Florida knocks the power out and it's usually
[00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:25.040]   in the hot weather, so you want to stay cool.
[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:27.440]   We thought, "Well, we can run electric fans on an ice maker.
[00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:28.840]   It'd be cool."
[00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:33.600]   I only mention this to give you geek cred.
[00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:37.120]   Which he has because he also runs, you run your computers and stuff on solar.
[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:41.360]   I'm running all the laptops and cell phones and all the little stuff, all the things that
[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:45.360]   you plug in with the wall where it runs off of the solar stuff.
[00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:51.520]   So speaking of touching pots in the studio, this is 420.
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:52.520]   You all know what that means.
[00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:54.520]   Veronica, I know you know what that means.
[00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:55.720]   What's that supposed to mean?
[00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:57.280]   Well, you're a young person.
[00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:58.280]   You're hip.
[00:07:58.280 --> 00:07:59.280]   You're with it.
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:00.280]   You're cool.
[00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:01.280]   Sure.
[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:02.280]   Did you know?
[00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:04.080]   I think I'm not cool.
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:10.760]   But did you know that the 420, which is a day that stoners use, in fact, there are
[00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:14.840]   usually, I remember in Toronto last year or the year before, they get together like
[00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:18.000]   in some public space and publicly flaunt the laws.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.480]   Although in Toronto, it's like, "Ooh, what are they going to, the Mounties are going
[00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:23.320]   to slap you?"
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:27.200]   It's not exactly illegal in Toronto, but they get together and they all smoke pot in public
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:30.240]   because 420 day that's, but this came, I didn't know this.
[00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:35.680]   Dane told me, our senior producer here, Dane Golden said, "This started at San Rafael
[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:37.560]   High just down the road.
[00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:44.960]   In 1971, the kids would all leave class at 420 PM to to to talk up at the Louis Pasteur
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:46.600]   statue."
[00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:49.240]   And that's where the name 420 comes from.
[00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:50.240]   Really?
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:53.200]   I always heard it was like the police code or something.
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.760]   Yeah, and I went to Snopes.com and it's not.
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:56.760]   All right.
[00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:04.320]   Although weirdly enough, in 2004, Arnold Schwarzenegger passed Senate Bill 2004 in California, making,
[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:10.440]   it's regulating the illegal pot sales in California, the, you know, the Mississnal,
[00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:11.440]   marijuana stuff.
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:13.920]   That was SB 420.
[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:16.080]   But that was, that was many years later.
[00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:18.280]   Anyway, all right, enough of that.
[00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:22.440]   Let's start talking tech because there's a lot of stories in the news today.
[00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:27.720]   I hear you Veronica, but I also hear little beeps coming out of you.
[00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:28.720]   Really?
[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:29.720]   I'm not doing anything.
[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:30.720]   Maybe it's me.
[00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:32.360]   Could be me.
[00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:36.080]   Federal officials charge a California woman stealing IDs from the dead.
[00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:39.880]   So there's a nice little, isn't a nice little twist.
[00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:44.600]   The Department of Commerce under the Freedom of Information Act puts out a database of
[00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:45.600]   dead people.
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:48.880]   It's called the monthly death index.
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:53.160]   And the idea of it, it has the birth dates and social security numbers of people who
[00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:55.320]   have died.
[00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:59.440]   The theory is it goes to banks and lending institutions so they can, you know, cross
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:01.440]   them off the records.
[00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:07.440]   But this woman, Tracy June Kirkland, is charged with going to rootsweb.com, which is a genealogy
[00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:13.600]   site, accessing this database and then calling the credit card company saying, "Oh, yes,
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:16.440]   I still have my account open.
[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:18.800]   I've, I've moved."
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:21.000]   And we'll give them a new address.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.720]   Sometimes she'll even add her own name to the credit card as a authorized user.
[00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:31.040]   She scammed hundreds of credit cards this way, including Nordstrom's Macy's and GE Moneybank.
[00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:33.040]   That's amazing.
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:36.600]   I love how it's actually supposed to prevent people from committing fraud.
[00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:37.600]   Yeah.
[00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:41.760]   And instead it's basically opened up the door for her to get a lot of money out of it.
[00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:42.760]   It's on a lot of money out of it.
[00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:43.760]   It's web, but it is public information.
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:45.560]   And it's only because these lenders don't do anything.
[00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:46.560]   They just ignore it.
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:48.560]   But they caught it, right?
[00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:51.840]   Yeah, she's going to, well, she might go to jail if she didn't.
[00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:52.840]   Accident.
[00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:53.840]   Probably.
[00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:55.920]   Should have moved to the Cayman Islands or something.
[00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:59.680]   Is that where you stash your money?
[00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:00.680]   He wishes.
[00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:01.680]   Yeah.
[00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:03.680]   I didn't hear a denial there.
[00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:07.160]   It's a good place to put it out here.
[00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:10.240]   So they don't, they, they, they don't do anything about it because the banks are a
[00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:14.920]   bunch of sleaze ball weasels and they just to soon make their life easier by overcharging
[00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:18.960]   everybody else at a rate of 18 plus percent on the card, which is the only reason you're
[00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:21.800]   paying those exorbitant fees, by the way.
[00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:22.800]   Yeah.
[00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:26.760]   It's easier just to overcharge and not worry about the losses.
[00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:28.160]   I got my credit card canceled.
[00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:31.720]   They called me up and said, you just buy something in Australia and then buy something
[00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:32.720]   in the US.
[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:34.200]   And I said, yeah, actually, as a matter of fact, I was just in Australia.
[00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:35.880]   Now I'm back.
[00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:37.280]   And they still canceled the card.
[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:38.280]   Yeah.
[00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:39.280]   It's a helmet.
[00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:40.280]   Sorry, we were to cancel it.
[00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:41.280]   But card was this Leo.
[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:42.280]   It's a visa.
[00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:44.480]   Oh, cause you know, I, I don't think you use them.
[00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:47.680]   I don't want to start plugging things, but I only use American Express because we don't
[00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:51.400]   want to get into debt to these other companies and American Express makes you pay every month.
[00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:52.400]   Yeah.
[00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:53.400]   So right.
[00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:56.400]   But they do, you know, they have, in fact, I'll bring this, I think I've talked about
[00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:59.440]   this before, but they have a, you know, a very good computer program and they know I
[00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:03.840]   travel a lot and I've always been shocked at like showing up out of the blue after getting
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:08.440]   a tank full of gas and Munich, you know, and then I didn't have someplace else and they
[00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:09.440]   never bother me.
[00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:10.440]   Yeah.
[00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:15.400]   I said once in a while, I mean, they do, but it's always, you know, in a very awkward situation
[00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:17.960]   or something, something where I never had the card pulled.
[00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:22.120]   But I was at a lecture one time where the CEO or one of the top guys at American Express
[00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:23.120]   was there.
[00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:25.960]   And I think I've blogged this and I've talked about it before and it's actually a good thing
[00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:26.960]   to test.
[00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:32.280]   He said they've got so many models that they can tell the spot is stolen credit card rather
[00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:33.280]   quickly.
[00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:37.280]   And he says the one that you will always get a card pulled, or you know, you'll have your
[00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:41.240]   card stopped on the spot is the following scenario that anyone out there can try and
[00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:42.880]   you'll see it works.
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:49.080]   You get, you get two tanks full of gas in a row and then go buy some Nike shoes.
[00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:54.520]   So fill up your SUV, fill up your caddy and then go buy some Nike shoes.
[00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:57.720]   Well, actually another thing is they found out a lot of kids who are like, you know,
[00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:01.200]   little scammers who have these cars.
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:06.320]   The first thing they do is they fill up their gas tank and their buddies and maybe another
[00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:10.520]   one because they got the car and then they go by but they start buying shoes.
[00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:14.840]   Somebody said that the gas thing is how they can test it because was it was this just seems
[00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:16.640]   like I just had this conversation.
[00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:19.560]   They could test it because then they can get away.
[00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:24.000]   If you know the merchant comes out and says, Hey, wait a minute, you just drive off.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   Hmm.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.080]   Makes sense though.
[00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:30.280]   And of course two tanks of gas would be right away would be a little suspicious.
[00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:33.040]   I mean, who buys two tanks of gas in a row?
[00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:34.360]   Yeah, that makes sense.
[00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:39.240]   I do sometimes because I have a big van and a lot of places they have a $50 cut off that
[00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:41.920]   won't fill it, you know, it fills it about halfway out.
[00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:45.920]   So you know, it'll look like I bought two purchases of gas in a row.
[00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:47.920]   My suggestion, Roger, stick with Adidas.
[00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:50.760]   I want to get an electric van.
[00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:51.760]   That would be better.
[00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:53.920]   Yeah, or an electric van, either one.
[00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:59.600]   I just want to pause for a second before we get back to the hilarity with our guests
[00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:02.640]   and welcome a brand new sponsor of the show.
[00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:05.120]   Because I don't know if you know, I've been talking about go to meeting, been using go
[00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:09.120]   to meeting for years, a long time sponsor on my radio show.
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:10.120]   I am a big fan.
[00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:13.560]   If you've never used go to meeting, we've got a special deal for you.
[00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:17.880]   Go to meeting makes online meetings easy.
[00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:22.080]   It's a way to turn a conference call and something really cool, really visual.
[00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:27.100]   No more traveling to meetings going across the country for an hour meeting going across
[00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:28.280]   town for a 10 minute meeting.
[00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:29.280]   You'll save time.
[00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:30.480]   You'll save money traveling.
[00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:31.640]   You'll increase your productivity.
[00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:33.840]   And frankly, it makes conference calls, which are frank.
[00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:36.840]   Let's be honest, not the most exciting things in the world.
[00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:37.840]   Engaging and fun.
[00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:38.840]   Here's what happens.
[00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:43.040]   You set up the meeting ahead of time or on the fly.
[00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:47.320]   And you just send the meeting ID via email.
[00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:53.760]   It's a click and outlook to your clients or colleagues, whoever you're meeting with.
[00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:54.760]   They click the link.
[00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:55.760]   They go to go to meeting.com.
[00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:59.240]   All of a sudden, they're seeing your computer on their desktops.
[00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:01.840]   So you're showing a PowerPoint.
[00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:02.840]   You can show them spreadsheets.
[00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:03.840]   You can collaborate.
[00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:04.840]   You can work together.
[00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:05.840]   You can say, "Oh, let's work on this document together."
[00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:08.480]   You can even give them control, which makes it great for training.
[00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:12.280]   If you've got a program you want to demonstrate to a client or train them in.
[00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:13.520]   You say, "Here's how it works.
[00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:15.880]   Now you try it and they can take control."
[00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:16.880]   Setup is just a couple of minutes.
[00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:17.880]   It's easy.
[00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:18.880]   It's secure.
[00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:19.880]   It's very affordable.
[00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:23.840]   You pay one low flat monthly rate for as many meetings you want for as long as you want.
[00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:25.840]   Now I want you to try it free.
[00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:29.840]   Go to go to meeting.com/twit.
[00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:30.840]   It's a special URL we've set up.
[00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:34.960]   You get one month absolutely free unlimited meetings for one month or 30 days.
[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:36.960]   Go to meeting.com/twit.
[00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:42.520]   G-O-T-O meeting.com/twit.
[00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:44.080]   We welcomed them to this week in Tech.
[00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:45.080]   It's great.
[00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:47.400]   It's good to have a long time friends and sponsors.
[00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:50.080]   These guys up at Citrix did go to meeting are just brilliant.
[00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:51.760]   I mean, some of the best programmers out there.
[00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:53.440]   They know their stuff.
[00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:57.000]   Go to meeting.com/twit.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   Give them a try.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   I think you'll like it.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.480]   What do you think of this guy?
[00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:04.000]   In fact, he's down.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.640]   I think he's your ways in Florida.
[00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:08.720]   His name is Rudy Padraza.
[00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:12.720]   He started a company called SciStar.
[00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:13.720]   They've advertised.
[00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:14.720]   Pardon me?
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:15.720]   Yeah.
[00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:22.560]   They say they're going to sell beige box clones with Macintosh OS 10 Leopard installed
[00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:23.560]   on it.
[00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:26.200]   I'd just say it's an Intel box.
[00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:29.160]   It's easy to say you're going to sell such a thing.
[00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:31.120]   But has anyone actually bought such a thing?
[00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:32.560]   Well, that's exactly what they said in Forbes.
[00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:34.040]   They said, "Okay.
[00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:35.040]   Let's see it.
[00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:36.520]   Who's got one of these?"
[00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:38.280]   There were some suspicious circumstances.
[00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:41.760]   The guy's initial address was a residential address.
[00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:43.480]   Then it was a warehouse district.
[00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:45.200]   It changed very rapidly.
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:50.040]   Also the credit card on the site, SciStar site, they stopped taking credit cards saying
[00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:51.040]   they're...
[00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:53.800]   He says the reason we moved is we had to move to a big warehouse.
[00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:55.920]   We've got a 40,000 square foot warehouse.
[00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:56.920]   We have 16 employees.
[00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:59.080]   We're adding four more because of all the demand.
[00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:04.000]   He also said we ran so many cards through the credit card service that they power pay
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.560]   that they locked our account.
[00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:07.560]   Maybe he bought some Nike's.
[00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:08.560]   I don't know.
[00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:13.160]   And then he went to PayPal where they also overloaded the account.
[00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:15.440]   So he says it's just because it's so popular.
[00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:16.560]   He says we think we could do it.
[00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:20.560]   Apple hasn't said anything yet, although it's pretty clearly a violation of the Yula.
[00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:28.360]   They're buying full retail copies of OS X and using Hackintosh, widely known Hackintosh
[00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:30.680]   techniques to get it working on a beige box.
[00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:32.000]   So open source stuff.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   So it's not really illegal to use it except for the Yula.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   Yeah.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   What's the worst Apple could do?
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.160]   Oh, you violated our Yula?
[00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:41.160]   Yeah.
[00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:44.120]   That's hard to enforce.
[00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:45.120]   I would like to see one.
[00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:47.120]   What do you think, John?
[00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:49.160]   Well, this is going to be a test case.
[00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:50.160]   Let's face it.
[00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:57.720]   I mean, somebody actually, somebody I think wrote on the blog or some place that whether
[00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:02.360]   or not this place is legitimate, these computers are going to be sold or whatever, it's an interesting
[00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:06.320]   scenario for a test case or somebody else to do.
[00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:13.200]   You know, can you do what's described, you know, take, get this operating system and commercialize
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:15.040]   it on the normal platform?
[00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:19.160]   You probably have to turn off updates because Apple would change, you know, change.
[00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:23.440]   I mean, I think they were thinking of it as a test for a legal test.
[00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:25.800]   Why haven't anyone tried this before?
[00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:26.800]   That's what I want to know.
[00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:27.800]   Selling it.
[00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:29.240]   If it's K, why aren't people doing it?
[00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:30.240]   Well, there are people.
[00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:32.160]   I mean, nobody's just nobody's selling it at retail.
[00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:34.600]   I mean, the, you know, there are a lot of people doing Hackintosh.
[00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:35.600]   Well, that's what I mean.
[00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:37.720]   I mean, how come no one's making a business out of this already?
[00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:38.880]   Well, I think terror.
[00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:42.040]   Well, Apple is very aggressive.
[00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:45.360]   I can't imagine these people are going to be around for very long.
[00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:46.360]   I agree with that.
[00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:47.360]   I'd be very aggressive.
[00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:48.360]   Apple is very aggressive.
[00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:49.360]   They've always been aggressive.
[00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:53.360]   They're aggressive, big in the Apple two days when they sued the pineapple computer.
[00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:54.360]   Sure.
[00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:55.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:56.760]   And it wasn't a Franklin days.
[00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:57.760]   Yeah.
[00:18:57.760 --> 00:18:58.760]   Yeah.
[00:18:58.760 --> 00:18:59.760]   Franklin made a clone.
[00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:00.760]   Right.
[00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:02.760]   And then they sued Franklin and essentially drove them out of business.
[00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:04.160]   Wasn't there a sanction?
[00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:05.160]   Mac clone at one time?
[00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:08.160]   Wasn't there a sanction on that?
[00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:10.160]   Yeah, during the era.
[00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:11.960]   Yeah, that was before jobs came back.
[00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:15.800]   The first thing jobs dude, when he, yeah, first thing, first thing he came, he did when
[00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:20.280]   he got came back as CEOs canceled those, which I think irritated a lot of people.
[00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:23.800]   They felt like what, you know, what are you doing?
[00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:28.640]   It's well, except that in the pre jobs era, what was needed to make Mac exciting was other
[00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:29.640]   companies.
[00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:32.440]   But once jobs came back, those guys weren't really needed anymore.
[00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:36.080]   Well, yeah, when I was, it turned out jobs made the exact right move.
[00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:38.600]   Has jobs made a bad move since he came back?
[00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:41.080]   I sure make beautiful hardware.
[00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:42.080]   Yeah.
[00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:44.240]   Do you use, you use Macs to record Roger?
[00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:45.240]   I think he's the addition.
[00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:46.240]   No, I do.
[00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:47.240]   I use them both.
[00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:50.880]   You know, but what happened was I was getting all these session, pro tool sessions sent to
[00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:52.680]   me like the Bob Dylan movie.
[00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:57.200]   They sent me a pro tool session from Colexico that I had to add my stuff to.
[00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:01.520]   So I had to, you know, and then PBS and a couple other people.
[00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:07.600]   So really just to be with the industry standard, I had to switch to Pro Tools and I'm using
[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:08.600]   it on a Mac.
[00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:09.920]   It's much better on a Mac.
[00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:11.440]   You could use it on, you could be all Windows.
[00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:12.840]   There's nothing requiring you to use.
[00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:13.840]   You can use it on Windows.
[00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:15.040]   But everyone's better on a Mac.
[00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:16.040]   Yeah.
[00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:17.040]   Well, that's good to know.
[00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:18.360]   I never liked Pro Tools, be honest.
[00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:20.160]   I could never figure the darn thing out.
[00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:21.160]   Really?
[00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:22.920]   That's pretty simple for sure.
[00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:24.000]   Did you study in school?
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.440]   Veronica has studied sound design.
[00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:27.920]   So you must have studied in school.
[00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:30.320]   Yeah, I used it pretty exclusively.
[00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:31.800]   Well, sound design.
[00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:34.000]   What kind, did you get a degree in something like that?
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:39.480]   I have a, my, my degree is in audio radio.
[00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:41.120]   What school did you give you?
[00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:42.120]   Emerson.
[00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:44.120]   Oh, it's a good school.
[00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:46.440]   No, seriously, it's a good school.
[00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:50.280]   You know, I basically majored in radio at Yale, but they don't have a degree in it.
[00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:53.520]   So I had to drop out to do it.
[00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:57.400]   That in 420 day was really put the end of my career at Yale.
[00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:58.400]   Oh my God.
[00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:01.800]   I was thinking of the Columbia School of Broadcasting when I was about 17.
[00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:02.800]   Were you?
[00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:05.680]   Yeah, I got to jump from the Latin letters instead.
[00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:09.320]   Oh, you know, I went to the Paul Allen School of Broadcasting.
[00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:11.120]   Yes, we all did.
[00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:12.120]   Yeah.
[00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:16.400]   I published on my blog because I found it in the comments very deep.
[00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:19.480]   It was a blog post seven years ago.
[00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:23.920]   We had a web guy, Josh Green, who, do you, do you, do you, you were around John during
[00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:24.920]   this?
[00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:29.400]   He, he was fired or he left under, you know, it was a disgruntled ex-employee who they
[00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:32.440]   forgot, just like the banks forget to cancel those credit cards.
[00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:34.680]   They forgot to cancel his VPN credentials.
[00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:41.240]   So he VP'd end into the website and put up this just nasty anti tech TV screed on the
[00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:46.920]   site in which basically what was interesting, this is in 2001, he predicted exactly what
[00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:49.680]   was going to happen to tech TV three years later.
[00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:52.960]   I mean, he said it's all, you know, it's a, it's an audience of one, Paul Allen, the
[00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:56.800]   minute Paul Allen gets sick of this, you know, he's going to pull the plug.
[00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:58.040]   And sure enough, that's what he did.
[00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:00.800]   And it was, it was more than one person.
[00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:03.520]   Well, you were watching it as well.
[00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:04.520]   I was watching it.
[00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:05.840]   I used to watch it on our tour bus.
[00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:09.040]   You know, we had a satellite thing on the tour bus.
[00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:13.480]   Willie Nelson used to, well, are somebody in, I don't know if Willie was watching?
[00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:16.640]   Willie was a little relaxed, but, but, but somebody was watching it in the Willie Nelson
[00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:19.680]   bus because Willie came by and did the screensaver.
[00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:22.120]   The coolest thing, coolest thing on TV.
[00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:26.040]   It was, it was really the only reason why I wanted to have a satellite, a mobile satellite
[00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:27.040]   thing.
[00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:31.960]   We, we did an interview with a Yahoo Internet life to interview with David Bowie who lived
[00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:34.560]   in an island somewhere in the number of people.
[00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:35.560]   I remember reading that.
[00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:39.200]   He said he was in the CNN, but then he got into tech TV instead.
[00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:40.200]   So what happened?
[00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:41.360]   We had at least four people watching.
[00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:45.480]   He lives in Bermuda, which is if you haven't ever been there, you should check it out.
[00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:46.800]   It's a very fascinating island.
[00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:51.400]   I actually have been to Bermuda and the police were shorts, which, you know, and a pith helmet.
[00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:55.080]   Bermuda shorts, as a matter of fact, is illegal to wear shorts and Bermuda that are above
[00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:56.080]   the knee.
[00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:57.080]   Yeah.
[00:22:57.080 --> 00:23:00.400]   And it's not a good look because they were Bermuda shorts black, and, you know, tall
[00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:02.400]   socks and black shoes.
[00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:04.400]   Black, like my father-in-law.
[00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:07.200]   Yeah, like, like, like, Irv.
[00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:11.680]   Irv, Irv was in the garment business for many years.
[00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:15.520]   Now he hangs out with his, you know, what you really don't though, one have is the
[00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:17.720]   garter's, the sock garter's.
[00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:18.720]   You don't want to see this.
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:20.520]   Oh man, you're making me blush.
[00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:22.120]   Are you wearing sock garters?
[00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:25.960]   No, but she will be when we outfit her in the Star Trek outfit.
[00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:26.960]   Yeah.
[00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:27.960]   Tell us about that.
[00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:28.960]   Oh, here we go.
[00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:29.960]   Here we go.
[00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:34.400]   You're going to use lasers to, lasers to measure her?
[00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:37.440]   No, we're going to send her to a real tailor.
[00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:41.320]   I mean, everybody wants to, I mean, we could probably have an auction to measure her and
[00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:43.000]   then we'd probably make some money on this deal.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   Oh, Jesus.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:48.600]   That being said, no, we're not going to measure her necessarily.
[00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:50.160]   I mean, she can measure herself.
[00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:53.200]   But the deal is, is that we're going to make her into a get her a Star Trek.
[00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:54.200]   We did it.
[00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:55.200]   This is a joke on cranky geeks.
[00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:58.920]   We mentioned that, you know, she, and she jumped at it because she thinks it would
[00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:03.280]   be cool for someone who would expect it of her to say that, but then we didn't realize
[00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:04.600]   she would what a geek girl she was.
[00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:05.600]   So she got.
[00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:06.600]   But here's the question.
[00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:10.520]   Is it going to be, you know, is it going to be in a who are a Star Trek outfit or a
[00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:12.040]   six of nine Star Trek outfit?
[00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:13.040]   There is a big difference.
[00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:16.000]   So we're six and we want it to be original series.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.040]   She wants original series and everybody wants six of nine, of course.
[00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:23.160]   By the way, the six and nine outfit is at some museum, someplace.
[00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:26.080]   It's either in Paul Allen's place or someplace else.
[00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:27.080]   And I saw it.
[00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:28.080]   Paul Allen.
[00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:30.200]   Why is it how small that girl is?
[00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:31.840]   You mean seven of nine?
[00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:32.840]   Seven of nine.
[00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:33.840]   Yeah, six of nine.
[00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:34.840]   Somebody else.
[00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:36.440]   Six of nine is her clone sister.
[00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:37.440]   Sorry.
[00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:38.440]   It's a different show.
[00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:39.440]   Different guy.
[00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:40.440]   The Borg.
[00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:41.440]   There's so confusing.
[00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:42.440]   They all look the same.
[00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:43.440]   Anyway, they had that outfit.
[00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:48.680]   She she must have like an 19 inch waist and she must be five one or something.
[00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:49.680]   Wow.
[00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:50.680]   Tiny lady.
[00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:52.880]   We're talking about Anika Hanson.
[00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:53.880]   The.
[00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:54.880]   Well, yeah.
[00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:55.880]   So the costume would be hilarious.
[00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:59.840]   It was all into something much bigger than it was originally meant to be.
[00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:03.040]   But now it's just kind of funny and he promised.
[00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:04.040]   So I'm hoping.
[00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:09.640]   And she said she actually said she would like the idea of wearing one of these things, which
[00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:14.200]   I think is the geekiest thing in the world to even be seen in one just as a joke.
[00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:17.440]   Is it going to be the mini skirt with the boots like the, you know, like kind of the
[00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:18.840]   Ptool of Clark look or?
[00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:19.840]   Oh, yeah.
[00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:20.840]   Heck yeah.
[00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:21.840]   Oh my God.
[00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:22.840]   That's what she wants.
[00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:26.800]   It's a website where people can put her into different ones to see what, you know, maybe
[00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:31.320]   take a copy of the whole, the whole paper doll idea that you've got here.
[00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:32.320]   I don't know if that.
[00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:37.360]   And this bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, she can be in all these different outfits.
[00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:39.360]   I don't know.
[00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:40.360]   It's just an idea.
[00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:44.160]   You're not going to have anything to do with that.
[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:46.040]   Just going to be your head on a stick figure.
[00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:48.040]   Is Patrick Norton going to be jealous?
[00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:52.640]   I don't know if Patrick will be jealous.
[00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:53.640]   How is that working with Patrick?
[00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:54.640]   You enjoying that?
[00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:55.800]   Oh, I love working with Patrick.
[00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:56.800]   He's great.
[00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:57.800]   Don't let him rub your head.
[00:25:57.800 --> 00:25:58.800]   He always used to rub my head.
[00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:03.200]   I have a bald spot on the top right there where he would just do the little, I think
[00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:04.960]   he did it for good luck.
[00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:06.280]   Don't let him do this guy.
[00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:08.920]   I don't think I'll want a bald spot.
[00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:10.720]   No, not so much.
[00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:12.280]   No, it's really wonderful working with them.
[00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:13.520]   I love all of them over there.
[00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:14.520]   Yeah.
[00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:17.200]   Basically that's tech TV over there, except for you and me and John.
[00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:18.400]   And that's it.
[00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:19.320]   That's all they're missing.
[00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:22.560]   And Tom, we need Tom Merritt to.
[00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:24.560]   Tom Merritt, he's got to be here.
[00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:25.560]   He's still a senior.
[00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:26.560]   Yeah.
[00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:28.880]   Tom's doing too well to go over to those guys.
[00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:29.880]   He's a star over there.
[00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:30.880]   He's a star over there.
[00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:31.880]   He's doing great.
[00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:33.920]   I think there's some other missing people.
[00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:38.600]   I mean, all there's all the people that actually stepped up the ladder like, you know, Erica
[00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:39.600]   and Michaela.
[00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:40.600]   They're too big.
[00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:41.600]   Yeah, we can't.
[00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:43.480]   Yeah, Erica's doing great on CNN.
[00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:45.440]   Well, she filled in for Anderson Cooper the other day.
[00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:49.480]   She's a she, you know, but I have to say I take a little bit of credit because when Erica
[00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:56.080]   started, she was working at tech TV radio and she ended up doing the news with me and
[00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:58.840]   we would do this banner thing back and forth on call for help.
[00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:02.680]   And I see a little bit of that going on with her and Anderson.
[00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:04.720]   I wonder if he has a ball.
[00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:08.480]   I do the first one over there that spotted her as a star when I saw her on the screen.
[00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:10.000]   I can document it.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   You can.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:14.160]   You know, she's she's getting more comfortable because she used to wrinkle her brow when
[00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:16.200]   she first got on for about a year.
[00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:17.520]   And now she's not doing that.
[00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:18.520]   You know more of that.
[00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:19.520]   I'm a serious botox.
[00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:20.520]   Botox.
[00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:21.520]   Botox.
[00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:22.520]   She can.
[00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:23.520]   She can no longer wrinkle anything.
[00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:24.520]   It's just dead.
[00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:28.320]   Oh, no, no, she's learned that she doesn't have to do this serious news person thing.
[00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:29.960]   She's very lively and fun.
[00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:31.880]   And she's totally doing that on AC 360.
[00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:34.280]   She's very good on that.
[00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:37.760]   We had a woman at, I wish I could remember her name, but she went a woman that was at
[00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:44.840]   PC magazine and she went to ABC overnight for a while and she would raise her eyebrows
[00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:45.840]   constantly.
[00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:49.440]   She's going to get a holder for the she wants elsewhere to tell her to get botox because
[00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:53.800]   she actually needed it because you know, you can't, you know, you get it in the forehead
[00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:55.600]   and you can't do that literally.
[00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:56.600]   Yeah, you can't.
[00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:58.080]   Oh my God, you guys are making me paranoid.
[00:27:58.080 --> 00:27:59.960]   No, don't listen to them.
[00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:00.960]   First of all, you're 23.
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:01.960]   No, I'm not.
[00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:02.960]   All right.
[00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:03.960]   Twenty five.
[00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:05.960]   You don't get Botox to you.
[00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:06.960]   At least 35.
[00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:11.680]   Well, it depends if she's like in a wiggler eyebrows and she's going to be blinking and
[00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:14.120]   wink and maybe we should start thinking about the Botox now.
[00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:16.320]   They were thinking to give me Botox in my hands.
[00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:17.320]   Yeah.
[00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:19.320]   She's a blinker and a winker.
[00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:21.640]   Lincoln, blinking in Belmont, we call her.
[00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:23.120]   Lincoln, oh great.
[00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:24.600]   I don't think Botox should be used.
[00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:25.600]   Belmont.
[00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:26.600]   I like it.
[00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:27.600]   Lincoln Belmont.
[00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:33.840]   Steve Balmer calls Vista a work in progress and a rare moment of candor from the, he's a
[00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:34.840]   working progress.
[00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:36.480]   Yeah, he's a work.
[00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:39.680]   He's a piece of work.
[00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:46.080]   He said, it sounds like Microsoft's kind of acknowledging that Vista isn't the greatest
[00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:49.160]   and he says Vista's bigger than XP.
[00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:50.320]   It's going to stay bigger than XP.
[00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:55.320]   We have to make sure it doesn't get bigger still and that the performance, oh, I guess
[00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:59.480]   he means in size and that the performance and the battery life and the compatibility,
[00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:02.440]   we're driving on the things that we need to drive hard to improve.
[00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:06.800]   It's so hard to read a quote from Steve Balmer because he in fact doesn't use, I don't know,
[00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:08.400]   maybe he has Botox in his tongue.
[00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:13.440]   I know we're going to continue to get feedback from people on how long XP should be available.
[00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:14.680]   We've got some opinions on that.
[00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:15.920]   We've expressed our views.
[00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:19.120]   I'm always interested in hearing from you on these other issues.
[00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:21.520]   It's the most expensive beta ever.
[00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:23.880]   Yeah, no kidding.
[00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:24.880]   What do you think about that, Paul?
[00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:25.880]   The rock, Mr. Windows weekly?
[00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:29.240]   Oh, I knew you were going to single me out.
[00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:30.240]   Of course.
[00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:31.960]   You're the Windows bigot.
[00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:32.960]   Wow.
[00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:33.960]   Wow.
[00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:37.040]   He says, well, Balmer says, I think we did a lot of things right and I think we have a
[00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:39.120]   lot of things we need to learn from.
[00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:45.000]   Well, I think I think Balmer is being honest.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   I just look at this as him being him.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.520]   I mean, this is the type of thing he says.
[00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:52.000]   He is pretty forthcoming about this kind of stuff.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.800]   Actually, that's a fresh experience.
[00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:54.800]   That's right.
[00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:58.560]   I mean, otherwise, there wouldn't be so many complaints.
[00:29:58.560 --> 00:29:59.720]   You know, something went wrong.
[00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:01.040]   They did something wrong.
[00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:06.760]   We talk about this on Windows weekly a lot and I think that it's an interesting divide.
[00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:11.360]   I mean, there are obviously the you called it last week the silent majority that uses
[00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:13.360]   VIST and is perfectly happy with it.
[00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:14.360]   Sure.
[00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:18.760]   Well, you're not going to hear from those guys, but you know, but they did take 27 years
[00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:20.040]   to bring it to market or whatever.
[00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:22.360]   So clearly that was too long.
[00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:24.000]   Oh, it was only five.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   It just felt like 27.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   It felt like 27.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:30.640]   I mean, I think my kids grew up and went to college during the beta period there.
[00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:34.120]   And already you're playing with Windows seven, the next version of Windows.
[00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:37.880]   Yeah, which is, you know, predictably, Windows Vista 2.0.
[00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:38.880]   Right.
[00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:39.880]   Right.
[00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:47.520]   PC sales are up quite, quite actually quite a bit, although not as much as originally
[00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:55.960]   predicted, US sales grew 3.5% worldwide sales, 14.6% in the first quarter of 2008.
[00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:57.880]   That did beat industry estimates.
[00:30:57.880 --> 00:31:02.720]   Apple and Dell, the big winners, Dell sales up 21.8% worldwide.
[00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:05.920]   Of course, I guess they're still losing money because they don't charge enough.
[00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:06.920]   I don't know.
[00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:09.400]   They're still in a funk financially.
[00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:16.000]   Apple sales up 32% in the US Q1 2008 32% in the US.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:16.920]   What were they up worldwide?
[00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:17.920]   Does anybody know?
[00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:22.640]   I'm looking at this to see worldwide vendor market.
[00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:23.640]   Yes.
[00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:26.440]   See, the artist, they aren't nearly as strong worldwide.
[00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:31.440]   So HP, then Dell, then Acer, then Lenovo, then Toshiba, they don't even show up in the
[00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:32.440]   top five.
[00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:35.480]   They're too expensive for the rest of the world, I think.
[00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:38.280]   Well, they are that there's another thing we're overlooking here, which is the rest
[00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:40.280]   of the world, especially the Asian communities.
[00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:45.200]   I think the general IQ is a lot higher and they don't have so much trouble using a computer
[00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:48.200]   in the first place that they need a Macintosh necessarily.
[00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:49.200]   Ooh.
[00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:50.200]   Okay.
[00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:52.200]   Devorak at Devorak.org, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:54.400]   I just wondered where you're going with that one.
[00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:55.400]   That's slamming anybody.
[00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:56.400]   I think that Mac's a great machine.
[00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:57.400]   I'm just saying.
[00:31:57.400 --> 00:31:59.680]   Devorak says, I got the most of the planet there.
[00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:00.880]   I got the dig headline.
[00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:05.520]   Devorak says, Mac users are too stupid to use Windows.
[00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:06.520]   Well, whatever.
[00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:07.520]   You know what?
[00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:09.760]   It's after before I say it.
[00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:10.760]   You said that I didn't.
[00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:12.520]   I would never say that, by the way.
[00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:15.520]   I'm expecting him to start using a Mac any day now.
[00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:17.600]   Yeah, you know, you think the Mac for a while?
[00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:18.600]   He did, yes.
[00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:19.840]   He gave it a good review.
[00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:20.840]   Yeah, he.
[00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:21.840]   I'm a Mac.
[00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:22.840]   Yeah.
[00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:23.840]   I know it's so it's.
[00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:30.320]   Oh, you know, Veronica has these moments where she actually does actually conceptual humor.
[00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:33.360]   She did it on the cranky geek show and nobody gets it.
[00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:34.360]   What?
[00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:35.360]   It's hilarious.
[00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:36.360]   What?
[00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:37.360]   What?
[00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:38.360]   I don't remember.
[00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:39.360]   I made some joke and it told me to.
[00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:40.360]   You made a joke.
[00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:41.360]   You mocked Sarah Lacey.
[00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:42.360]   Did I?
[00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:43.360]   Oh, no.
[00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:44.360]   Yes, yes, I did.
[00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:45.360]   Yes.
[00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:46.360]   Yeah, but not a mean way.
[00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:50.560]   No, no, I'm very, but it was funny, but only after an hour later when she explained
[00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:51.560]   it.
[00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:57.000]   Well, what happened is we were talking about my April Fool's joke on Mahalo Daily where
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:02.280]   I pretend interviewed Steve Jobs and we've recrolled everyone and we were talking about
[00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:07.160]   something and I said, oh, yeah, but he kept telling me to ask real questions and just
[00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:08.160]   no one made any.
[00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:09.160]   No one loves.
[00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:10.160]   Oh, I love it.
[00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:12.560]   And so I moved on and we kept talking about it and I'm like, no one got my story.
[00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:13.560]   I would have gotten that.
[00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:14.560]   I would have gotten that.
[00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:16.840]   Well, that's what I get for trying.
[00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:19.960]   You know, by the way, Rick rolling.
[00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:20.960]   Can't.
[00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:21.960]   It's over.
[00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:23.600]   CNN did a big story on it.
[00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:24.600]   It's over.
[00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:26.160]   It was over.
[00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:27.920]   It was over when I did it.
[00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:30.400]   Yeah, the Vorek did it and then CNN did a story on it.
[00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:31.400]   It's over.
[00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:34.280]   We got to find some other way to prank people.
[00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:38.160]   I've been trying to get the, you know, buddy, get a break in my stride song to be the next
[00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:40.200]   to the role hasn't hasn't picked up.
[00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:42.040]   That's a theme from great American hero.
[00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:43.040]   What is that?
[00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:45.160]   I don't even want to break my stride.
[00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:47.000]   I know, but again, I hope I'll be.
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:51.080]   I have to tell you, the reason the Roger McGinn is on this show is because I don't even
[00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:55.560]   remember doing this, but apparently I sang an excurable version of Mr. Tamborine man.
[00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:59.800]   Yeah, I thought you were, I thought you were P.O. and I mean, you know, it sounded like,
[00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:01.280]   hey, Mr. Tamborine.
[00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:02.520]   He thought I was mocking.
[00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:04.200]   He thought he was punishing you.
[00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:06.160]   I thought you were angry with me for some.
[00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:07.680]   That's how I sing.
[00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:10.080]   Spam beyond Facebook or something.
[00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:12.960]   You know, memes just happened to have to happen organically.
[00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:15.960]   You can't decide that something's going to be a meme or it doesn't work.
[00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:17.320]   How would you feel, Roger?
[00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:20.920]   I mean, how do you think first of all, Rick Astley must love this because, I mean, I'm
[00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:24.600]   sure he's making money off the fact that all of a sudden everybody's Rick rolling every.
[00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:26.360]   What if they did a Roger role?
[00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:27.680]   Would it be an insult to you, Roger?
[00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:30.280]   Or would you be, would you take the money and run?
[00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:33.400]   I would think it was, you know, a good publicity stunt.
[00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:34.400]   Yeah.
[00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:36.480]   Like, like, do Warwick would say, right?
[00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:37.480]   John.
[00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:42.520]   Well, you know, I, I agree on the, in the big sense of things, but in the, on the small
[00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:44.920]   micro sense of things, I think it's an insult.
[00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:45.920]   Yeah.
[00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:47.560]   Well, he was a one hit wonders.
[00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:50.320]   He's like, stochus, stochus, stoch, could be a, you know, meaningful, but you got to
[00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:52.160]   wonder how much money did Rick Astley make?
[00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:53.160]   Do you think he made any?
[00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:55.360]   He must have made some money.
[00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:56.360]   What in his life?
[00:34:56.360 --> 00:35:00.200]   No, no, no, on, on the fact that everybody's playing, they were going to give you up.
[00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:02.360]   He's not getting anything out of the whole thing.
[00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:05.680]   He probably is, you just probably just has to take, put up with a bunch of grief from
[00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:06.680]   his buddies.
[00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:08.400]   Probably Neil Sedaka has the publishing.
[00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:09.880]   Though he's going on tour.
[00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:10.880]   He, yeah, that's it.
[00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:11.880]   You're right.
[00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:12.880]   He's coming back.
[00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:13.880]   You're right.
[00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:14.880]   He's coming back.
[00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:15.880]   Yeah.
[00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:16.880]   What is this?
[00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:17.880]   Like the ringtone tour of America.
[00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:22.760]   That's why, and anybody wanting to do anything like that again, if he's coming back.
[00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:26.640]   That's like the officers girlfriend, you know, you don't.
[00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:28.240]   Yes, she's got a career on it.
[00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:29.240]   Doesn't he?
[00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:30.240]   Yeah.
[00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:31.240]   Let me look.
[00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:33.400]   Let me go to a Wikipedia, the source of all knowledge.
[00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:36.440]   Oh, just have a bunk.
[00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:37.840]   See, see what's going on.
[00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:39.680]   At least to the 420 crowd.
[00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:40.680]   Yeah.
[00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:42.360]   20 is estimated.
[00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:44.760]   25 million users were tricked into watching.
[00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:47.640]   They were going to give you up.
[00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:52.040]   The worst hour, the best one was Dr. Teakey's.
[00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:58.320]   He had a video of Lala in the shower for like one second.
[00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:02.440]   You see her turn on the water, her wrist, and that's never going to give you up.
[00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:04.560]   Man, that was mean.
[00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:06.760]   That was cold.
[00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:11.600]   Cruel and unusual punishment.
[00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:14.520]   There is a Rick Astley's greatest hits, but I don't know what else would be on there.
[00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:15.920]   It's kind of a short record.
[00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:18.600]   Just read it a bit more.
[00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:22.880]   That's three versions of never going to give you up.
[00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:25.760]   Including the video on YouTube.
[00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:29.000]   I'm thinking a bunch of mixes, but I couldn't come up with any good hits.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.840]   The meanest Rick role is there's one.
[00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:32.840]   What is it called?
[00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:33.840]   The Internet is I can't remember.
[00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:37.520]   I won't give you the URL anyway if I knew it, but you go there and not only does it launch
[00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:41.040]   the video, every time you try to close it, it jumps somewhere else.
[00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:42.040]   Oh, gosh.
[00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:43.040]   Yeah.
[00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:45.200]   You pretty much have to shut the machine down to stop it.
[00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:46.200]   That's the most one.
[00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:50.040]   You could go to control with the Windows machine, the knowledgeable users know that they go
[00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:51.880]   to control all delete and hit the processes.
[00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:54.160]   All the Asians know how to stop it.
[00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:55.160]   All the Asians.
[00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:56.160]   The exact winners users.
[00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:58.920]   The Asians can do it.
[00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:00.800]   eBay is speaking of intelligence.
[00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:05.320]   eBay is thinking of getting out of the Skype business.
[00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:08.800]   This is an interesting story because nobody really could figure out.
[00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:09.800]   I remember we've talked about this.
[00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:11.600]   Why they bought it in the first place.
[00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:12.600]   They bought it in the first place.
[00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:14.000]   But is Skype's business model?
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   I mean, is there advertising?
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.520]   I don't see any advertising on it.
[00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:18.520]   You know what they do.
[00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:21.200]   No, you're talking about Skype interaction over.
[00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:23.160]   I'm sorry, eBay interaction over Skype.
[00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:24.160]   Aren't you like the?
[00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:25.480]   Well, eBay bought Skype, right?
[00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:26.480]   For what?
[00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:27.480]   For billions.
[00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:28.480]   Like four billion dollars.
[00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:31.440]   But the idea being that what people are going to talk to each other on the phone about
[00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:32.920]   their products or?
[00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:33.840]   Well, that's the problem.
[00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:34.840]   So they I'm sorry.
[00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:38.400]   They spent $3.1 billion.
[00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:41.560]   They wrote down the value to $1.4 billion after concluding.
[00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:43.600]   It's not going to match its earlier hopes.
[00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:48.800]   And the new CEO at eBay is saying if we don't find a way to make, you know, John Donnie
[00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:52.200]   says if we can't figure out a way to make this work with our business and nobody else
[00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:56.440]   could figure what it could be, we will probably sell it.
[00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:59.280]   Shouldn't they have come to this determination before they spent the money?
[00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:00.840]   They spent $3.1 billion.
[00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:02.960]   Now here's the interesting thing.
[00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:07.720]   Skype had a 61% increase in its first quarter revenue this year.
[00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:13.800]   The $1.09 million users worldwide, isn't it the web 2.0 credo that you don't have to worry
[00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:16.840]   about a business model, just get numbers and the business model will follow?
[00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:18.440]   I think you've told me that, John.
[00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:19.440]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:22.680]   That's the whole way the business is done in Silicon Valley.
[00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:24.880]   Those people are worth about 20 bucks ahead.
[00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:27.480]   So why can't eBay figure out what to do with it?
[00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:28.480]   I don't know.
[00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:29.480]   Ask them.
[00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:31.040]   They're obviously, you know, I'll tell you something.
[00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:35.320]   The eBay is never impressed with being able to develop any sort of model other than the
[00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:39.440]   original one that they first came up with because even at one point during the era in
[00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:45.120]   the late '90s when everybody was taking this huge capitalization that they had accumulated
[00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:50.240]   because of the stock market and everything else in the post bubble burst, they bought
[00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:54.100]   Butterfield and Butterfield and looked at me as they were going to go into the real auction
[00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:57.960]   business and have both the online thing locked up and then take over the world because they
[00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:00.040]   had enough capitalization to do it.
[00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:01.040]   So they bought Butterfield and Butterfield.
[00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:03.720]   I thought they were going to buy Christie's and they could have bought the whole group.
[00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:06.400]   And then they just, I don't know, it's too much work.
[00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:09.760]   And so they bailed out on everything and they went right back to their original model.
[00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:10.760]   Pez dispensers.
[00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:12.120]   It's all about the Pez dispensers.
[00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:14.080]   I don't think they have any real...
[00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:15.520]   I don't collect those.
[00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:16.680]   That's how it started, you know.
[00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:21.600]   Yeah, it's all... and then then then there was crappy little dolls, those little...
[00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:24.080]   What are those things called those squeeze things from Ty?
[00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:25.080]   Those little crappy little...
[00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:26.080]   Cupi dolls.
[00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:27.080]   Cupi doll.
[00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:28.080]   Oh, Beanie Babies.
[00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:29.080]   Beanie Babies.
[00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:30.080]   Big, baby.
[00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:31.080]   Big, baby.
[00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:32.080]   Big, baby.
[00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:33.080]   Big, baby.
[00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:34.080]   You want to keep an Atlantic?
[00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:35.080]   You could get the original...
[00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:36.080]   The original...
[00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:37.080]   No, anyway.
[00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:38.080]   I mean, I don't think...
[00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:39.080]   I don't have a...
[00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:42.000]   Yeah, I think they do what they do well, but they don't seem to be able to do anything
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   else.
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   No, I agree with...
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:48.440]   I mean, I can see why they would think that Skype would be a good purchase for them.
[00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:52.280]   I can kind of get it how people could call each other.
[00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:53.280]   Nobody else can.
[00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:55.760]   But I don't think people are really interested in doing that.
[00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:57.560]   I would integrate with eBay's business, though.
[00:39:57.560 --> 00:40:01.000]   What are you saying you called the seller and say, "Hey, dude, that Pez dispenser way
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   overpriced."
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:03.000]   Yeah, I guess if you talk...
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   Ask for details.
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   Ask for details.
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:06.720]   Maybe ask for details, exactly.
[00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:09.760]   But you could do that whether eBay owns Skype or not.
[00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:10.760]   They had the money.
[00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:12.320]   It's too much human interaction, though.
[00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:14.760]   People don't actually want to talk to each other about that kind of thing.
[00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:15.760]   No, no.
[00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:16.760]   Maybe you should do.
[00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:17.760]   I don't even want to talk to you.
[00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:18.760]   I just said, I barely want to talk to you guys.
[00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:19.760]   Right now, yeah.
[00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:24.080]   And by the way, the eBay, typically, eBay users aren't necessarily the types that are
[00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:26.720]   going to be into all these gizmos and gadgets and screwiness.
[00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:28.960]   I mean, they may not be able to figure out how to use Skype.
[00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:30.640]   Now, if the whole thing was in Asia...
[00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:32.640]   They're probably all Mac users.
[00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:33.640]   Yeah.
[00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:34.640]   For Europe.
[00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:40.160]   Hey, I'm trying the best I can.
[00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:41.640]   I'm looking for my rim shots.
[00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:42.640]   Sorry.
[00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:44.640]   The podcast is huge, in Asia.
[00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:45.640]   We don't know what to do.
[00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:50.680]   So Leo, have you had any chance to play with your XO from OLPC?
[00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:51.680]   I have.
[00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:54.560]   You know, in fact, I have it right here downstairs.
[00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:56.960]   I've come back here too.
[00:40:56.960 --> 00:41:01.160]   This is the one laptop per child that was originally supposed to be $100.
[00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:02.360]   I think it's $200.
[00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:05.360]   You and I bought it as the Give One Get One program.
[00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:06.360]   You buy one.
[00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:07.360]   Did you...
[00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:08.360]   Yeah, Paul has one.
[00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:09.360]   Yeah.
[00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:10.360]   Did you over-call it?
[00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:11.360]   No.
[00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:12.360]   I didn't tell that one.
[00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:13.360]   I was keeping it.
[00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:14.360]   It's original design.
[00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:16.800]   You can get a 30% increase in speed.
[00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:19.000]   It's 30% of zero, though.
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:20.920]   I want to put Vista on it.
[00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:22.720]   Can I put Vista on it?
[00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:23.720]   Uh-huh.
[00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:24.720]   Yeah.
[00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:25.720]   Do it.
[00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:26.720]   Do it, Leo.
[00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:28.400]   It barely runs red hat.
[00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:29.400]   I mean, it's just...
[00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:30.400]   What's it got?
[00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:31.400]   One gig flash drive?
[00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:32.400]   Is that a...
[00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:34.400]   Yeah, but you were spoiled because...
[00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:37.840]   You have a disposable income and you can throw your money and garbage.
[00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:38.840]   If you're a kid...
[00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:39.840]   It's not garbage.
[00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:40.840]   It's a good little box.
[00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:41.840]   That's interesting.
[00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:44.760]   I use it in my dressing room for Twittering.
[00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:46.680]   I Twitter in my dressing room with it.
[00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:47.680]   Wait a minute.
[00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:48.680]   No, okay.
[00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:49.680]   I don't want to know anymore.
[00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:54.280]   I want a picture of Roger in his dressing room with his little cute little OLPC in his
[00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:57.960]   lap and the little green ears sticking up, Twittering.
[00:41:57.960 --> 00:41:58.960]   This I want to see.
[00:41:58.960 --> 00:41:59.960]   Well...
[00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:02.400]   Now, you could have an Aces EPC.
[00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:04.760]   You think this is better than that?
[00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:05.760]   No.
[00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:06.760]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:08.760]   I would say compared to any of that...
[00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:09.760]   I had summarizes, everything.
[00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:11.760]   It's not faster.
[00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:12.760]   It's underpowered.
[00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:15.440]   It just takes a lot of time to do anything.
[00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:18.280]   And it's got some weird kind of...
[00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:19.280]   The operating things.
[00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:22.800]   I mean, if you want to play a video, you have to go to this other thing that starts
[00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:26.480]   up like a little star and it goes up into another thing and it puts up...
[00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:27.680]   It's weird, isn't it?
[00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:29.600]   Yeah, it's a whole interface.
[00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:31.480]   The networking stuff is kind of cool though.
[00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:33.200]   I can see all the available networks.
[00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:34.200]   The mesh, yeah.
[00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:35.200]   Yeah.
[00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:37.960]   Oh, and also it won't play YouTube videos at all.
[00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:38.960]   Oh, wow.
[00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:42.000]   It won't play flash videos from YouTube.
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   And let's see what else does...
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:44.280]   It's kind of like the iPhone.
[00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:46.240]   Yeah, well, right.
[00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:49.760]   And when you're in Gmail, there's no cursor in the reply box.
[00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:51.800]   So you have to kind of guess that we're...
[00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:53.720]   And sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't.
[00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:54.720]   Wow.
[00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:57.280]   Well, it wasn't really designed to do email and play YouTube videos.
[00:42:57.280 --> 00:43:00.960]   It's designed for schools, K through six schools.
[00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:05.680]   And I mean, maybe we have trouble with the interface because we're used to Macs and Windows.
[00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:07.680]   Maybe a kid never has used a computer.
[00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:11.640]   I mean, how can someone get used to a computer using this thing and then move to a Mac or
[00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:12.640]   a Windows machine?
[00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:13.640]   It is so different.
[00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:14.640]   It's so different.
[00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:16.560]   I don't even understand.
[00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:19.760]   So you think Intel's classmate, which is...
[00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:24.080]   And by the way, Nick Negropani, I think was pissed off about this because both Intel and
[00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:28.320]   Microsoft, who were originally work partners with this, dropped out as soon as they choose
[00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:32.880]   the AMD processor until said, "Well, if we're out of here, we're going to make a classmate
[00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:35.880]   was equally cheap running Windows."
[00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:37.720]   Is it XP?
[00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:40.440]   Yeah, and undermine you in all of these markets.
[00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:41.440]   It's undermine.
[00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:45.000]   It's like, why does he get the monopoly on this idea?
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.240]   It doesn't make any sense to me that he should be complaining.
[00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:48.400]   I thought it was a laptop.
[00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:52.480]   It was supposed to be like throwing laptops out to the poor people in Africa and every
[00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:53.480]   place else.
[00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:55.480]   Why would somebody say, "Well, you're going to do it too with that.
[00:43:55.480 --> 00:43:57.320]   You're stepping on my toes."
[00:43:57.320 --> 00:43:59.120]   In Nick's defense, he's never done that.
[00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:01.200]   But you could just tell that the steam's coming out of his ears.
[00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:04.360]   But he's been very careful because I think he knows it would be unseemly.
[00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:08.160]   He's been very careful not to say it out loud.
[00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:10.160]   I just...
[00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:14.360]   You can point to any low-cost laptop and there are a bunch coming out now and in the future.
[00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:18.400]   I think almost any one of them would be more appropriate for a child than...
[00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:26.360]   I think the new Asus E900, which is a bigger screen, in every respect the same as the Asus
[00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:29.520]   700, except that I think it has...
[00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:30.520]   Is it a nine-inch screen?
[00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:33.960]   It's got a bigger drive.
[00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:37.720]   One thing I love about the XO though, that you can turn off the backlight and use it as
[00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:39.720]   a reader, like the Amazon.
[00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:40.720]   Yeah.
[00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:41.720]   It has a nice...
[00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:42.720]   No, no, no.
[00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:44.320]   It's not the hardware is okay.
[00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:46.320]   It's just the interface is so screwy.
[00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:47.320]   I just...
[00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:50.160]   I don't like the interface here.
[00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:53.280]   I don't know who designed this or how, but it's just so...
[00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:55.240]   Well, it's red hat.
[00:44:55.240 --> 00:44:57.520]   It's some version of red hat.
[00:44:57.520 --> 00:45:00.040]   But there's a big python interface on it called Sugar.
[00:45:00.040 --> 00:45:04.280]   It's sugar, I think it's sugar, and then there's Squeak is on it too, which is a small
[00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:05.280]   talk implementation.
[00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:06.800]   I mean, I think in some ways this would be...
[00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:10.280]   I would love to do as an experiment, give it to a nine-year-old and say...
[00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:12.880]   I did do that, but my kids had no idea what to do with it.
[00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:13.880]   Oh, interesting.
[00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:16.880]   No problem picking up computers, but this one they just...
[00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:19.880]   They were really excited, but they saw it.
[00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:22.440]   Who never had any kind of computer before?
[00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:24.120]   Would it be more intuitive than you did it?
[00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:25.120]   Give it to an Asian.
[00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:26.880]   It's kind of a catch point.
[00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:27.880]   I was thinking of anything.
[00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:29.240]   So what difference does it make?
[00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:30.240]   That's not a good test.
[00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:31.720]   It's kind of a catch-22.
[00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:36.120]   There's no manual, and the manual's all online, and how to get online is in the manual.
[00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:38.120]   You're getting online without the manual.
[00:45:38.120 --> 00:45:39.120]   Yeah.
[00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:40.120]   It's...
[00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:41.120]   It's really convoluted.
[00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:43.840]   I mean, you have to go to this network thing and then look at all the little things.
[00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:47.800]   You have to go into the little circles and pick one that isn't locked.
[00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:51.600]   Well, yeah, if you want to run WPA encryption, you've got to actually do this command line
[00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:52.600]   hack.
[00:45:52.600 --> 00:45:54.200]   It doesn't do WPA, right?
[00:45:54.200 --> 00:45:55.200]   I have a box, yeah.
[00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:57.440]   Yeah, which is a brother that I've had.
[00:45:57.440 --> 00:45:59.920]   I think we should just get to the top and move ahead.
[00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:00.920]   Okay, here we go.
[00:46:00.920 --> 00:46:04.280]   I mean, you, Roger.
[00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:07.800]   Roger wanted to talk about the XO laptop, and I think we've done that.
[00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:08.800]   Okay.
[00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:09.800]   I'm happy.
[00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:10.800]   Do you have an Asus EPC?
[00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:12.360]   No.
[00:46:12.360 --> 00:46:13.360]   I would get that.
[00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:14.360]   That's the ultimate gadget.
[00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:15.360]   That's...
[00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:16.360]   Yeah, the new one is still...
[00:46:16.360 --> 00:46:17.360]   It's 1024 by 600.
[00:46:17.360 --> 00:46:20.160]   How many computers do you need?
[00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:22.640]   Oh, as many as you can fit in the room.
[00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:23.920]   Every single one.
[00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:24.920]   That's the answer.
[00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:26.960]   One more than I have.
[00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:27.960]   Always.
[00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:28.960]   Always.
[00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:29.960]   Exactly.
[00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:32.880]   I love my MacBook Pro.
[00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:34.680]   My MacBook Pro is my favorite.
[00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:35.680]   Me too.
[00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:38.960]   I'm going back to the regular MacBook again and again.
[00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:39.960]   I love my MacBook Pro.
[00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:43.840]   I'm having a steady stream of laptops coming through here.
[00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:45.280]   That thing is just a workhorse.
[00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:46.280]   You know?
[00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:49.640]   It's interesting because everybody, all the photographers I was working with in Tasmania
[00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:52.200]   and the best photographers in the world, they all had Macs, almost all.
[00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:53.680]   One or two had Windows.
[00:46:53.680 --> 00:47:00.640]   But did you see this lawsuit from a photographer who says, first of all, the MacBook, all the
[00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:04.640]   MacBook screens only do, even though it says millions of colors, in fact, are only doing
[00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:07.680]   219,000 colors.
[00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:09.400]   And then complains that they're very unevenly lit.
[00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:11.040]   The color is inaccurate.
[00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:15.000]   These are actually terrible things to try to look at your photos with.
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   He's suing them.
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:19.800]   He's like, it's about time somebody sued them.
[00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:23.160]   Is there a difference between the LED backlit Macs and the other ones?
[00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:24.520]   The fluorescent?
[00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:26.400]   I think LED is more accurate.
[00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:27.400]   Absolutely.
[00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:29.080]   Fluorescent is inherently kind of uneven, right?
[00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:30.080]   You got this bright corner.
[00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:31.080]   That's kind of blue.
[00:47:31.080 --> 00:47:32.080]   Yeah.
[00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:34.400]   But that would affect the number of colors, right?
[00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:35.400]   No.
[00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:36.720]   And that's what the lawsuit is about.
[00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:38.960]   Any MacBook ever sold?
[00:47:38.960 --> 00:47:42.560]   This thing is displaying 219,000 colors, not millions of colors.
[00:47:42.560 --> 00:47:43.560]   Yeah.
[00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:44.560]   They claim millions of colors.
[00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:46.040]   But is that not a display setting?
[00:47:46.040 --> 00:47:47.040]   Like millions of colors.
[00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:48.040]   No, no.
[00:47:48.040 --> 00:47:49.040]   Yes.
[00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:50.040]   They claim it.
[00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:55.480]   But I think I'm seeing millions of colors on mine.
[00:47:55.480 --> 00:47:56.480]   It's 420.
[00:47:56.480 --> 00:47:57.480]   Why not?
[00:47:57.480 --> 00:48:02.920]   I've never noticed any difference between this computer and other PCs and I.
[00:48:02.920 --> 00:48:03.920]   Well, okay.
[00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:06.320]   Apple has settled the lawsuit.
[00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:07.320]   Let me see the latest.
[00:48:07.320 --> 00:48:08.320]   Fred Greaves and David.
[00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:11.360]   They're going to fix it, I thought, through a software patch.
[00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:12.360]   Yeah.
[00:48:12.360 --> 00:48:14.960]   Well, I guess there's a couple of different issues.
[00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:15.960]   One is that there...
[00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:18.560]   I'm sorry, is the display driver is that causing this problem?
[00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:19.920]   Not the LCD and native?
[00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:21.560]   No, I think it's hardware.
[00:48:21.560 --> 00:48:22.560]   Hmm.
[00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:23.560]   I don't...
[00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:25.560]   How could this display be any different from that on any...
[00:48:25.560 --> 00:48:26.560]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:33.680]   Apple used six-bit displays, which generated 262,144 discrete colors and then dithered it
[00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:37.120]   to appear to look like it had 16.7 million.
[00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:42.200]   Apple doesn't say where the displays came from, but they did use these six-bit displays
[00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:45.560]   in both MacBook and MacBook Pro lines.
[00:48:45.560 --> 00:48:48.000]   It is a display.
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:52.880]   It's a hardware issue.
[00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:53.880]   Let's see.
[00:48:53.880 --> 00:48:56.200]   It looks like Apple settled.
[00:48:56.200 --> 00:49:02.760]   The original lawsuit was that the displays were grainy and sparkly.
[00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:06.960]   Some people observed banding, but then I think when that happens, they investigated the hardware
[00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:08.840]   and found, "Oh, this is why there's banding.
[00:49:08.840 --> 00:49:09.840]   It's dithered."
[00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:10.840]   Apple settled.
[00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:11.840]   What does that mean?
[00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:14.840]   Well, we don't know what it means.
[00:49:14.840 --> 00:49:15.840]   It's funny.
[00:49:15.840 --> 00:49:16.840]   It's really good.
[00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:17.840]   It looks creamy and smooth.
[00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:18.840]   I think the air looks fantastic.
[00:49:18.840 --> 00:49:19.840]   The air looks like a piece of paper.
[00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:20.840]   I mean, it's so solid.
[00:49:20.840 --> 00:49:29.280]   It's like something that might be in an envelope.
[00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:34.440]   Let's get back to the news.
[00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:35.440]   That's news!
[00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:36.440]   I know.
[00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:40.080]   You're starting to drift again.
[00:49:40.080 --> 00:49:42.520]   Pretty soon it's going to deteriorate to talking about Twitter.
[00:49:42.520 --> 00:49:44.520]   Oh, heaven for fanned.
[00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:47.400]   I can't believe anyone is still using Twitter, though.
[00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:50.320]   What's the next thing after Twitter, Paul?
[00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:54.000]   Oh, I'm stopping using Twitter and just getting on with life.
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:58.160]   Yeah, actually, Humacloud, the cartoonist who does gaping void, which is a wonderful...
[00:49:58.160 --> 00:50:00.960]   You've seen these little postcard cartoons.
[00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:02.640]   He was big on Twitter.
[00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:03.640]   He is big on Twitter.
[00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:04.640]   But he's about two weeks ago.
[00:50:04.640 --> 00:50:05.640]   He said, "That's it.
[00:50:05.640 --> 00:50:06.640]   I'm dumb on Twitter.
[00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:07.640]   I don't blog anymore.
[00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:08.640]   I hate Twitter.
[00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:09.640]   I hate Twitter."
[00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:10.640]   So it's gone like a day.
[00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:11.640]   He's back to Twitter.
[00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:12.640]   I looked.
[00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:13.640]   He'd Twittered like 40 times in 24 hours.
[00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:14.640]   Yes.
[00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:15.640]   This is a guy with the actual...
[00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:17.640]   Do anything or just Twitter about Twittering?
[00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:20.640]   Boy, it didn't take much to get the conversation off-tracking on the Twitter.
[00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:21.640]   You started it.
[00:50:21.640 --> 00:50:22.640]   You started it.
[00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:23.640]   You started it.
[00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:27.160]   I did it out to everybody out there that this is the problem with this show.
[00:50:27.160 --> 00:50:29.120]   No, wait a minute, John.
[00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:30.120]   There is no problem with this show.
[00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:33.600]   I don't drive a driver at the helm, you know, on a track that goes in.
[00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:34.600]   I'm sorry, I'm high.
[00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:35.600]   I thought it was...
[00:50:35.600 --> 00:50:38.520]   I thought the problem was before I got org.blog.
[00:50:38.520 --> 00:50:39.680]   That's not the problem.
[00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:42.720]   That's the solution according to John.
[00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:44.600]   It's a great blog.
[00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:45.600]   It is.
[00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:47.600]   I like it.
[00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:51.560]   We should mention that one of the postings on this, by the way, it's misspelled, John,
[00:50:51.560 --> 00:50:54.040]   just in case you want to fix that.
[00:50:54.040 --> 00:50:55.760]   Tribute to your mom who passed away recently.
[00:50:55.760 --> 00:50:57.160]   But did I misspell?
[00:50:57.160 --> 00:51:01.520]   Well, you misspell in the morian with a you.
[00:51:01.520 --> 00:51:02.560]   You know, I was looking at it.
[00:51:02.560 --> 00:51:05.800]   I looked it up and there's like about five different ways of putting that.
[00:51:05.800 --> 00:51:08.640]   Well, pick one because the title of the post is with an A.
[00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:10.560]   Yeah, I got to change the title.
[00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:12.560]   In the illustration of the version of the art world.
[00:51:12.560 --> 00:51:13.560]   I got to match the art world.
[00:51:13.560 --> 00:51:16.720]   I mean, I don't mean this is a terrible thing to rag you about and I apologize.
[00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:17.720]   Yes, terrible.
[00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:19.520]   That's so insensitive.
[00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:23.680]   But okay, now, okay, I'm going to make a big confession here and you can hate me if
[00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:24.680]   you want.
[00:51:24.680 --> 00:51:25.680]   Hold on one second.
[00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:28.320]   Well, you're doing that.
[00:51:28.320 --> 00:51:29.320]   I'm fixing it.
[00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:30.320]   All right.
[00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:31.320]   You can hate me if you want.
[00:51:31.320 --> 00:51:32.320]   What is it misspelling?
[00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:34.440]   I thought, Oh, this is an April Fool's joke.
[00:51:34.440 --> 00:51:35.600]   John put on a wig.
[00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:37.760]   That is so sick.
[00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:38.760]   It's not April 1st.
[00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:40.760]   I only do April Fool's jokes on April.
[00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:42.160]   You look a little like your mom.
[00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:44.840]   I'm going to say that.
[00:51:44.840 --> 00:51:47.400]   Look, folks, look at this post.
[00:51:47.400 --> 00:51:49.280]   Post one seven three four six.
[00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:53.800]   You could see how on first glance I might have think John like did that as a joke.
[00:51:53.800 --> 00:51:55.600]   No, I'm a sick person.
[00:51:55.600 --> 00:51:56.600]   You are terrible.
[00:51:56.600 --> 00:51:57.600]   I'm so sorry.
[00:51:57.600 --> 00:51:58.600]   I'm embarrassed.
[00:51:58.600 --> 00:51:59.600]   Shame on.
[00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:00.600]   Hate me.
[00:52:00.600 --> 00:52:04.480]   But you know, Leo knows me long enough that, you know, it's it's in them.
[00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:05.640]   Well, I see what you're saying.
[00:52:05.640 --> 00:52:08.120]   Yeah, let me fix it right now.
[00:52:08.120 --> 00:52:11.040]   I thought it was a I always thought it was Memorial.
[00:52:11.040 --> 00:52:14.520]   You know, I looked it up and looked it up and there's like, believe me, there's different
[00:52:14.520 --> 00:52:15.520]   versions of it.
[00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:17.040]   I'm going to keep it with the you.
[00:52:17.040 --> 00:52:19.240]   I think one is like derived from the Latin.
[00:52:19.240 --> 00:52:20.240]   It's Latin.
[00:52:20.240 --> 00:52:21.400]   And somebody will send me.
[00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:24.840]   I don't have the the the comments on.
[00:52:24.840 --> 00:52:28.480]   So I mean, if it was a joke, by the way, I probably will have the comments on.
[00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:29.480]   But no, I apologize.
[00:52:29.480 --> 00:52:30.480]   I apologize.
[00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:32.520]   And I'm sorry about your mom and the archindolences.
[00:52:32.520 --> 00:52:34.840]   And I'm sure that that's not spelled right.
[00:52:34.840 --> 00:52:35.840]   Nothing to joke about.
[00:52:35.840 --> 00:52:36.840]   I apologize.
[00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:40.560]   And that's why I said, I know this is reprehensible, but it's just because I've known you for
[00:52:40.560 --> 00:52:42.360]   a while and you're kind of a prankster.
[00:52:42.360 --> 00:52:43.360]   Okay.
[00:52:43.360 --> 00:52:45.520]   Yeah, that's that I have my limits.
[00:52:45.520 --> 00:52:46.880]   You wouldn't joke about that.
[00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:47.880]   You're right.
[00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:49.480]   That would be that would be poor taste.
[00:52:49.480 --> 00:52:50.480]   Okay.
[00:52:50.480 --> 00:52:51.920]   I feel really bad now.
[00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:52.920]   You should.
[00:52:52.920 --> 00:52:54.560]   We'll get back under the news track.
[00:52:54.560 --> 00:52:55.560]   That would be a plus.
[00:52:55.560 --> 00:52:56.560]   How about this?
[00:52:56.560 --> 00:53:02.840]   Microsoft has started selling a copy of version of works free to the PC makers called works
[00:53:02.840 --> 00:53:06.160]   S E. It stands for sponsored edition.
[00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:09.000]   It has ads in it.
[00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:11.240]   But the PC makers only pay a few bucks for it.
[00:53:11.240 --> 00:53:12.240]   It's free.
[00:53:12.240 --> 00:53:13.240]   It's free.
[00:53:13.240 --> 00:53:16.200]   And in fact, I mean, the other one, the non the non.
[00:53:16.200 --> 00:53:17.640]   Oh, yeah, the non free one.
[00:53:17.640 --> 00:53:19.520]   So they're saving a buck.
[00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:21.480]   Why does Microsoft?
[00:53:21.480 --> 00:53:22.480]   Why is it?
[00:53:22.480 --> 00:53:27.040]   They're going to get on this advertising JAG where they got to sell ads and they got to
[00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:28.040]   do this.
[00:53:28.040 --> 00:53:30.200]   Because Google, they're trying to keep up with Google.
[00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:32.840]   Google's not a software company.
[00:53:32.840 --> 00:53:35.640]   Microsoft's a software company and they why aren't they do it?
[00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:37.760]   We're spending their efforts on software.
[00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:38.760]   People buy software.
[00:53:38.760 --> 00:53:40.760]   They're going to be buying software.
[00:53:40.760 --> 00:53:42.960]   That's so that's so 1980 software.
[00:53:42.960 --> 00:53:45.120]   That's not their software is dead.
[00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:46.600]   Software is last century.
[00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:47.840]   Of course, dead.
[00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:50.080]   There's no software's imaginary.
[00:53:50.080 --> 00:53:55.680]   Well, I mean, regardless of whether software is really not, does anybody actually use works?
[00:53:55.680 --> 00:53:57.240]   Is this a no?
[00:53:57.240 --> 00:53:59.440]   Is there a human being on this earth that you can't.
[00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:02.040]   My wife and Bella uses works.
[00:54:02.040 --> 00:54:04.040]   My wife uses.
[00:54:04.040 --> 00:54:09.000]   I mean, I'm like, so I mean, people still use word pad.
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:10.000]   Come on, Paul.
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:13.520]   No, in Asia, they're using notepad and they're happy.
[00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:17.320]   I'm actually writing my Windows Vista book and notepad.
[00:54:17.320 --> 00:54:18.320]   Are you really?
[00:54:18.320 --> 00:54:19.320]   Every day.
[00:54:19.320 --> 00:54:26.280]   Well, actually text edit is probably a lot more worthwhile than Microsoft works.
[00:54:26.280 --> 00:54:27.480]   Anybody here have small children?
[00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:29.040]   You have small children, Paul.
[00:54:29.040 --> 00:54:30.040]   Yeah.
[00:54:30.040 --> 00:54:32.280]   I would let my kids use works.
[00:54:32.280 --> 00:54:33.280]   That's the real one.
[00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:34.680]   No, I'm changing the subject.
[00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:36.680]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:54:36.680 --> 00:54:39.240]   Parents, don't let your kids use works.
[00:54:39.240 --> 00:54:43.640]   No, I'm changing the subject because there's a new audible site and we wanted to mention
[00:54:43.640 --> 00:54:46.640]   this called audible kids.
[00:54:46.640 --> 00:54:48.240]   And I know you're an audible user, Paul.
[00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:49.880]   Audible kids.com/twit.
[00:54:49.880 --> 00:54:52.640]   It is, I think this is really neat.
[00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:58.080]   It's the first new site that Audible has done since they started 10 years ago.
[00:54:58.080 --> 00:54:59.080]   Audible.com.
[00:54:59.080 --> 00:55:01.040]   I mean, Audible kids.com.
[00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:03.880]   I did just by an iPod for my son.
[00:55:03.880 --> 00:55:08.120]   Kids, you're a failure parent, you'll see, because first of all, of course, you read
[00:55:08.120 --> 00:55:09.200]   to your kids.
[00:55:09.200 --> 00:55:15.120]   But also, and Megan does this, she's got three-year-olds and a five-year-old and she'll
[00:55:15.120 --> 00:55:19.240]   read to them, but then they love listening to the book again, like, make way for ducklings
[00:55:19.240 --> 00:55:20.240]   or something.
[00:55:20.240 --> 00:55:22.240]   They're like listening to it again on tape.
[00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:24.400]   And it's kind of nice for the parent.
[00:55:24.400 --> 00:55:30.720]   This is educators and parents have gotten together to put this site together.
[00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:33.400]   It turns your iPod into an audio book thing.
[00:55:33.400 --> 00:55:35.200]   I think it's good for literacy.
[00:55:35.200 --> 00:55:36.440]   I don't think that it hurts.
[00:55:36.440 --> 00:55:37.440]   I think you're right.
[00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:38.440]   They're going to still read.
[00:55:38.440 --> 00:55:40.520]   Nobody's saying don't read.
[00:55:40.520 --> 00:55:44.440]   Then what's nice is if you have kids, that's what's on here.
[00:55:44.440 --> 00:55:48.160]   For more on kids.com/twittle, one-of-a-kind community for parents, educators and their
[00:55:48.160 --> 00:55:52.520]   children focused on igniting a young person's love of reading.
[00:55:52.520 --> 00:56:00.160]   You'll see at the bottom, they have reading as fundamental, free downloads for children's
[00:56:00.160 --> 00:56:01.160]   literacy.
[00:56:01.160 --> 00:56:07.800]   They've got 99 cent specials, exclusive audio from probably the most popular author for
[00:56:07.800 --> 00:56:10.560]   kids in K-6 RL Stein.
[00:56:10.560 --> 00:56:11.560]   His stuff is...
[00:56:11.560 --> 00:56:13.960]   Veronica, you probably are young enough to remember goosebumps.
[00:56:13.960 --> 00:56:15.960]   Did you read the goosebumps stuff when you were a kid?
[00:56:15.960 --> 00:56:16.960]   I love goosebumps.
[00:56:16.960 --> 00:56:17.960]   I knew it.
[00:56:17.960 --> 00:56:18.960]   Isn't that great?
[00:56:18.960 --> 00:56:19.960]   Loved goosebumps.
[00:56:19.960 --> 00:56:20.960]   And are you afraid of the dark?
[00:56:20.960 --> 00:56:21.960]   Yeah.
[00:56:21.960 --> 00:56:23.760]   Now wouldn't you like to hear goosebumps?
[00:56:23.760 --> 00:56:25.760]   I mean, it's not just...
[00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:26.760]   Wait a minute.
[00:56:26.760 --> 00:56:31.760]   I'm trying to hear it now.
[00:56:31.760 --> 00:56:34.760]   Goosebumps, Corland.
[00:56:34.760 --> 00:56:36.760]   Book one.
[00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:38.960]   Revenge of the living dummy.
[00:56:38.960 --> 00:56:43.160]   See, doesn't that bring fireless honeycans?
[00:56:43.160 --> 00:56:44.160]   Don't you get memories now?
[00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:45.160]   No, it's alright.
[00:56:45.160 --> 00:56:46.160]   So you know the thing with these?
[00:56:46.160 --> 00:56:47.160]   Revenge of the living dummy.
[00:56:47.160 --> 00:56:48.160]   Who could that be?
[00:56:48.160 --> 00:56:49.160]   It's for kids.
[00:56:49.160 --> 00:56:50.160]   Oh.
[00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:52.640]   It's like Chucky for kids.
[00:56:52.640 --> 00:56:54.720]   Anyway, audiblekids.com.
[00:56:54.720 --> 00:56:55.720]   You know we love Audible.
[00:56:55.720 --> 00:56:57.520]   Paul's a big Audible listener.
[00:56:57.520 --> 00:57:00.000]   Audiblekids.com/twit.
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:01.920]   You can get a free kids...
[00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:06.720]   A ton of free kids downloads available to new and existing Audible customers.
[00:57:06.720 --> 00:57:09.640]   So this is a kind of a special offer that we haven't done before.
[00:57:09.640 --> 00:57:13.280]   However, not available to UK residents.
[00:57:13.280 --> 00:57:15.720]   And that's just, I don't know, publishers restrictions.
[00:57:15.720 --> 00:57:18.600]   Audible.com/twit for a free trial offer.
[00:57:18.600 --> 00:57:24.000]   I just downloaded Obama's books and they're really great because he puts it in his own
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:25.920]   words and you really get the feeling.
[00:57:25.920 --> 00:57:26.920]   And he's reading it.
[00:57:26.920 --> 00:57:28.320]   Yeah, you fall in love with a guy.
[00:57:28.320 --> 00:57:29.320]   I mean, he's...
[00:57:29.320 --> 00:57:30.320]   I know.
[00:57:30.320 --> 00:57:31.320]   Incredible.
[00:57:31.320 --> 00:57:32.320]   Obama's the new Twitter.
[00:57:32.320 --> 00:57:37.840]   Oh, you're just right behind him, Will.
[00:57:37.840 --> 00:57:40.240]   You know, it's me and Obama at the top of the list.
[00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:41.240]   It's amazing.
[00:57:41.240 --> 00:57:44.480]   If you're a Twitter Obama, he starts following you.
[00:57:44.480 --> 00:57:45.480]   Yeah.
[00:57:45.480 --> 00:57:50.080]   There's a script that they can enable on Twitter where Scoble was using this.
[00:57:50.080 --> 00:57:51.080]   He finally turned it off.
[00:57:51.080 --> 00:57:54.840]   He said, "You know, 20,000 people, it's kind of hard to read.
[00:57:54.840 --> 00:57:55.840]   I've never done that.
[00:57:55.840 --> 00:57:56.840]   I don't want to do that."
[00:57:56.840 --> 00:57:58.520]   But no, Obama, yeah, it's interesting.
[00:57:58.520 --> 00:58:02.640]   And now what's really interesting is Hillary Clinton is also on Twitter.
[00:58:02.640 --> 00:58:04.240]   Does not follow us.
[00:58:04.240 --> 00:58:05.240]   Follows no one.
[00:58:05.240 --> 00:58:07.640]   John Edwards, who was big on Twitter.
[00:58:07.640 --> 00:58:09.240]   He was, I think, the first...
[00:58:09.240 --> 00:58:10.840]   Now that he's not a candidate, screw you guys.
[00:58:10.840 --> 00:58:11.840]   I don't have a...
[00:58:11.840 --> 00:58:13.640]   I don't want to talk to the white polloy.
[00:58:13.640 --> 00:58:14.640]   Nothing to say.
[00:58:14.640 --> 00:58:15.640]   Nothing to say.
[00:58:15.640 --> 00:58:16.640]   He's gone.
[00:58:16.640 --> 00:58:17.640]   Yeah, these people are all insincere.
[00:58:17.640 --> 00:58:18.640]   Well...
[00:58:18.640 --> 00:58:19.640]   These are insincere Twitterers.
[00:58:19.640 --> 00:58:20.640]   I think so.
[00:58:20.640 --> 00:58:22.760]   I mean, there's Twitter is marketing, right?
[00:58:22.760 --> 00:58:25.680]   And that's what I liked about what you do, John, is you're putting content in there.
[00:58:25.680 --> 00:58:26.680]   It's not about marketing.
[00:58:26.680 --> 00:58:28.120]   But here's the interesting thing.
[00:58:28.120 --> 00:58:29.120]   Yet.
[00:58:29.120 --> 00:58:32.200]   When Hillary Clinton Twitterers, she was...
[00:58:32.200 --> 00:58:33.200]   She...
[00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:34.200]   Her staff...
[00:58:34.200 --> 00:58:35.200]   You use his eye.
[00:58:35.200 --> 00:58:37.200]   Oh, I see what you do.
[00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:38.200]   I don't like that.
[00:58:38.200 --> 00:58:40.960]   Unless she's really doing it.
[00:58:40.960 --> 00:58:41.960]   It's entirely...
[00:58:41.960 --> 00:58:42.960]   Highly doubt she's really...
[00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:49.360]   Not to get into politics, but you get sort of an IR-we kind of thing from her anyway.
[00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:52.080]   There's a big engine there.
[00:58:52.080 --> 00:58:53.560]   It's the royal we.
[00:58:53.560 --> 00:58:55.480]   We, I wouldn't be bothered with.
[00:58:55.480 --> 00:58:58.680]   But she's saying, "I" as if she is posting that Twitter.
[00:58:58.680 --> 00:59:01.040]   And so then I thought, "Well, I wonder if Obama's doing that.
[00:59:01.040 --> 00:59:02.040]   I went here."
[00:59:02.040 --> 00:59:05.600]   And he has no pronouns at all.
[00:59:05.600 --> 00:59:08.800]   So clearly somebody on his staff thought about this and said, "Well, we don't want to say
[00:59:08.800 --> 00:59:12.000]   'he' we don't want to say 'we' we don't want to say 'I'."
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:16.240]   So for instance, his most recent post, he just says, "In Reading and Scranton PA today,
[00:59:16.240 --> 00:59:18.120]   honored to be campaigning.
[00:59:18.120 --> 00:59:19.120]   There's no pronoun."
[00:59:19.120 --> 00:59:20.120]   Headlines.
[00:59:20.120 --> 00:59:21.120]   News headlines.
[00:59:21.120 --> 00:59:22.120]   But I think there's a conscience.
[00:59:22.120 --> 00:59:23.120]   Some bites.
[00:59:23.120 --> 00:59:24.120]   Some bites.
[00:59:24.120 --> 00:59:25.120]   Some bites.
[00:59:25.120 --> 00:59:27.920]   In PA, at the Alliance for American Manufacturing, stating that any trade agreement must contain
[00:59:27.920 --> 00:59:31.920]   real enforceable standards, there's no "he we I" at all.
[00:59:31.920 --> 00:59:32.920]   So you said...
[00:59:32.920 --> 00:59:33.920]   He said stating instead of saying...
[00:59:33.920 --> 00:59:34.920]   He said stating instead of saying...
[00:59:34.920 --> 00:59:35.920]   He said stating.
[00:59:35.920 --> 00:59:36.920]   Well, you...
[00:59:36.920 --> 00:59:37.920]   I mean, look, a staffer's writing this.
[00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:41.560]   I don't see Barack standing backstage while he's being introduced to Twittering on his
[00:59:41.560 --> 00:59:42.560]   cell phone.
[00:59:42.560 --> 00:59:43.560]   Yeah.
[00:59:43.560 --> 00:59:46.920]   I've got to get a no-can, 95 in their hands and get him quick.
[00:59:46.920 --> 00:59:50.080]   Wouldn't it be cool though if like, okay, whoever gets elected?
[00:59:50.080 --> 00:59:53.080]   Don't quick only works with Nokia phones.
[00:59:53.080 --> 00:59:54.080]   What does?
[00:59:54.080 --> 00:59:55.080]   Quick only works.
[00:59:55.080 --> 00:59:56.080]   How come quick.com?
[00:59:56.080 --> 00:59:57.080]   Oh, they can't figure that out.
[00:59:57.080 --> 00:59:59.840]   Nokia, it's easier to write stuff for S60 because it's a real operating system.
[00:59:59.840 --> 01:00:01.320]   I think that's the real reason.
[01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:03.320]   I got a trio and I can't get on...
[01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:04.320]   No.
[01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:05.320]   Quick is cool.
[01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:06.320]   Trying to get used to it.
[01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:07.320]   Trying to get used to it.
[01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:11.120]   Quick is the one that the scope will use to spam everybody at Davos.
[01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:13.200]   That's what turned me off of it now.
[01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:18.440]   I get a little kind of nauseous when I see the quick...
[01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:20.240]   Because he sneak up on people.
[01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:22.240]   "Quick, look, you're on the internet.
[01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:23.240]   That's a little weird."
[01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:24.240]   That's what we're...
[01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:25.240]   That's what we're...
[01:00:25.240 --> 01:00:26.240]   That's what we're...
[01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:27.240]   That's what we're...
[01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:28.240]   Also, I'm very boring.
[01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:29.240]   Oh, you're not?
[01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:30.240]   Leo, what were you...
[01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:33.000]   What were you streaming your broadcast from Australia with?
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:34.000]   You stream and stick them.
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:37.080]   Actually, I think it was mostly stick them there.
[01:00:37.080 --> 01:00:40.720]   And you know what we're trying right now to decide because I'm going to start streaming
[01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:43.960]   like 25 hours a week because I'm like you, Veronica.
[01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:48.040]   I think people like to look at me and I'm going to get a mini-skirt.
[01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:50.800]   Can we make a copy of that comment?
[01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:53.640]   I like to use it as a sound bite.
[01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:56.800]   I'm already making it into a t-shirt.
[01:00:56.800 --> 01:01:00.160]   I figure 25 hours of Leo is just not enough.
[01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:02.520]   25 hours of Leo is never enough.
[01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:03.520]   A week!
[01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:04.520]   What am I nuts?
[01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:06.840]   So, what we'll do is we'll stream everything.
[01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:12.480]   Everything I'm doing, all the podcasts, the radio show, but I'm trying to decide which
[01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:14.600]   to use, use stream or stick them.
[01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:18.120]   All this week, I'm going to be doing trials with both of them.
[01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:19.120]   We have a T1.
[01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:21.560]   I bought a T1 just for video.
[01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:23.600]   There's not going to be anything else using it.
[01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:25.640]   I would go with use stream.
[01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:26.640]   Why?
[01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:29.000]   I mean, I really like the guys that stick them.
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.360]   I just think it's more stable.
[01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:32.360]   I don't know.
[01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:33.360]   I don't know.
