[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:35.640]   This is Twit, this week in Twit.
[00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:37.640]   A show that covers--
[00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:38.640]   That's recursive.
[00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.040]   It's a recursive show.
[00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.040]   A show that covers itself endlessly.
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.760]   Like, what is the worm Borat Baratunde eating his tail?
[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.280]   No, I think it's Orobus.
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.960]   Orobus.
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:51.480]   I don't know.
[00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:52.480]   I know what you're talking about.
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:53.480]   You know what I'm talking about, man?
[00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:54.000]   Yeah.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.840]   Are you with me there?
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.160]   Boratunde Thurston is here.
[00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.720]   He is, of course, the host of Popular Science on Discovery.
[00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:02.160]   Is that right?
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.920]   Did I say that right?
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.680]   Popular Science is Future of.
[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.120]   Future of, I forgot the Future of.
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.120]   He is the future of new media.
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.080]   Let's put it that way.
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.120]   How about that?
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.120]   Oh, thanks.
[00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.120]   Also here, I would say a partner in crime, Heather Gold.
[00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.600]   Hey.
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.400]   HeatherGold.com.
[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.880]   She's a comic.
[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.360]   She's Jewish.
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.560]   She's a lesbian, and she's drunk.
[00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.320]   So I think it's going to be a great show.
[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.560]   And to keep this all well-grounded,
[00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.000]   John C. Devorak.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.120]   What are you wearing there?
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.640]   That looks like a nice scarf, a little polka dot scarf there.
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.880]   Devorakchallowdevorak.com.
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.400]   Sorry, I didn't mean to wake you, John.
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.760]   No, these are actually three--
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:43.520]   this is interesting.
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.360]   I just saw these on the lane here.
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.280]   I just-- three ties, actually.
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.480]   Why are you wearing three ties?
[00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.120]   I think I'm going to start making that a fashion.
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.600]   I felt bad when I saw a man with three heads
[00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.920]   until I met a man with three ties.
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:58.800]   That doesn't work.
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.000]   That proverb doesn't work when you tell it that way.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.720]   So we can all expect this to be a fascinating show.
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:04.600]   Well, it's good so far.
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.000]   I don't know about you, but I'm having a blast.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.200]   So get this.
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.280]   And you're not going to--
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.200]   we talked a couple episodes ago about my farmville problem.
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.240]   You have a farmville problem?
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:15.600]   I have a farmville problem, and I--
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:16.320]   He's addicted.
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.200]   I was addicted, but I gave it up.
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.840]   I thought it was going to be like you needed some--
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:21.680]   I need some cows.
[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:22.720]   Pharmaceutical assistance.
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:23.840]   Does anybody have some cows?
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:24.800]   So you can really deliver.
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.000]   Have you ever played farmville on Facebook?
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.120]   I haven't played this, isn't this?
[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.880]   This is Marpinkas' deal?
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:30.800]   Yes.
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:31.280]   All right.
[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.320]   He makes hundreds of millions of dollars a year by zingas.
[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.960]   E-Y-N-G.
[00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:35.440]   E-Y-N-G.
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.000]   Sucking people into these stupid, yet somehow
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.240]   bizarrely addictive games.
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.120]   I think animals is pretty much-- you
[00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.680]   can't lose if you do anything with animals.
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.040]   It's got animals and fruit.
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.280]   And, well, fruits or food?
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.400]   Food fruit.
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.640]   You can raise artichokes.
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:50.600]   You can raise beets.
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.600]   You can raise wheat, rice.
[00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.120]   That's a winner right there.
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.320]   And the way he makes money is you pay him cash for virtual farm
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.360]   books so you can buy a fence.
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:02.640]   I'm all about virtual stuff.
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:03.400]   I want cookies.
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.360]   You could be doing it right now with our shows.
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.760]   Virtual, fun, little things to give each other.
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.480]   So I've kind of mocked this whole thing.
[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.160]   But I did-- literally, I took farmville off my Facebook
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.660]   boxes.
[00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:15.320]   You know what Mel Brooks is--
[00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.840]   Cold Turkey.
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:16.840]   Cold Turkey.
[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:17.340]   Wow.
[00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.840]   You did it off.
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:18.440]   And I miss it.
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.440]   I miss it.
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:19.640]   I wonder how the artichokes are doing.
[00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:20.140]   Please.
[00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:21.520]   Mel Brooks is 2,000 year old man.
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:22.720]   I always said we mocked the thing.
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.520]   We are to be Leo.
[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:25.560]   You mocked the farm.
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:26.000]   I am farmville.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.880]   You are farmville.
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.560]   There may be a Twitville in my future.
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.200]   However, get this--
[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.240]   for all the noise and attention Twitter gets,
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.560]   Farmville is bigger than Twitter than all of Twitter.
[00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.040]   A Facebook application--
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.880]   --is all measured how--
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.560]   It has-- they have 16 get this.
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.440]   This is how addictive this sucker is.
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.000]   They have 69 million active players.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.680]   It's the largest Facebook app by a factor of 2 to 1
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.480]   over the next highest competitor.
[00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:00.120]   Daily active players, 26.5 million.
[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.800]   And that's not surprising because in order for you to do this,
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.320]   if you plant artichokes, you've got to come back tomorrow
[00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.440]   or they turn brown and shrivel up.
[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:08.760]   OK, see, here's the thing.
[00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.440]   We used to have a nation in the US of farmers--
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:13.080]   Right.
[00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.280]   --agricultural people.
[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.600]   And I think it's less than 1% now.
[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:19.680]   And if just a percent of the people playing farmville
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.000]   with such a dedication or to go to their rooftops
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.880]   or their windowsills or their front or backyards
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.840]   and actually plant a real thing,
[00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.840]   how would we be so much better off?
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.440]   I really thought you were going to say,
[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:33.920]   a shout, I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it in.
[00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:35.120]   But that's a better idea.
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.040]   You put that into planning an artichoke.
[00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:38.640]   I fully support Baratunde.
[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:40.480]   And then you save yourself so many?
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:41.880]   You mean plant an actual artichoke?
[00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:43.200]   Yes, a real thing.
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:44.680]   A thing that grows in the ground.
[00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.040]   You put dirt under your fingernails and there's snails.
[00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:48.960]   I don't want to do that.
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.440]   Yeah.
[00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:52.840]   John, just into America.
[00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:54.080]   I'm virtual America.
[00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:55.480]   I'm going to buy the entire issue of--
[00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.120]   John, you're old enough to remember real farmers.
[00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.480]   You remember those?
[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:01.240]   Remember them.
[00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.280]   I am one.
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.400]   I think that's a joke there somewhere.
[00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.280]   Farmville is-- OK, number two is causes,
[00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.240]   which I also have on my Facebook page.
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:16.120]   The Cafe World, Happy Aquarium, Mafia Wars Zinga, Fishville
[00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:20.480]   Zinga, Pet Society, Texas Holden Poker Zinga,
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.480]   Yoville for people of your color.
[00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:24.240]   What?
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:25.720]   Not you.
[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.040]   No, Yoville.
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:28.000]   Yoville.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.680]   They decided that Farmville might not
[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.520]   appeal to African-Americans and other urban--
[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:32.760]   Because they didn't farm.
[00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.400]   Because other urban types.
[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:35.600]   And they made Yoville.
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:36.080]   Without Yoville.
[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:37.160]   Do you just say yo or--
[00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:37.660]   Yo.
[00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:39.040]   Yo.
[00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:40.200]   I don't know.
[00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.240]   And so these are the top 10 apps.
[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:46.320]   And so with 69 million app, monthly active players,
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:48.360]   that is estimated to be bigger.
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.200]   Nobody knows how big Twitter is.
[00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:52.920]   But I think it's a much bigger than the active user group
[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:54.920]   at Twitter, much bigger.
[00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:56.000]   69 million.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.200]   There's only 300 million people in the US.
[00:06:59.200 --> 00:06:59.760]   Really?
[00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:00.200]   Yeah.
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:00.760]   69 million.
[00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:04.400]   Why do you feel so much bigger when I'm on there?
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.000]   Was that racist for me to say--
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:06.800]   It was Yoville.
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:07.360]   Yoville.
[00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:07.840]   Yeah.
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:08.760]   It was cute.
[00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:09.800]   It was cute racist.
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.600]   It was like confusing cute racist.
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:12.800]   It wasn't malicious.
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.200]   Well, the confusion was I pushed the button for Heather's
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:15.560]   picture.
[00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.160]   That's what really confused me.
[00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:19.440]   Because you were trying to challenge the stereotypes.
[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:20.560]   I exactly--
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.240]   I was breaking down--
[00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:23.800]   Exactly.
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:24.800]   Breaking down.
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:25.720]   So I'll leave it on what--
[00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.120]   So you talked about this a few weeks ago.
[00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:30.480]   And people are starting to bellyache now that you're just
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:32.880]   moaning and we're not talking tech.
[00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:34.000]   OK, not tech.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:34.480]   Let me think.
[00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:35.240]   Not tech.
[00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:39.200]   It's an application on a website that
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:41.240]   is the biggest website of all time and the biggest
[00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:42.760]   application on that website.
[00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:44.760]   How is this not tech?
[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:47.440]   They want it to sound less human and more like--
[00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:48.760]   It's not just not tech.
[00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:52.240]   They want me to talk about motherboards and processatives.
[00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:53.360]   They want welding.
[00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:54.840]   They don't like touchy-feely.
[00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:59.720]   They want an accelerator to stuff being exploded and stuff
[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:00.200]   like that.
[00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:00.720]   Am I right?
[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:01.240]   Am I right?
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:01.720]   Is that because--
[00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:03.240]   We've got two guys here from the Argonne National
[00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:03.840]   Laboratories.
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:05.360]   They're engineers.
[00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:06.160]   I want to--
[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:07.360]   I'm just trying to be interested in this.
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:07.720]   --and this one.
[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:08.720]   OK, frankly.
[00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:09.720]   Would you enjoy FarmVilla?
[00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:13.040]   Would you rather me hold a soldering iron?
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:16.000]   And I've got clippers.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.720]   And now I'm going to rewire my microphone
[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:19.720]   while we do the show.
[00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:22.880]   Now is that tech for you?
[00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:26.360]   So I'm thinking that it's tech the same way
[00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:29.760]   that discussing a YouTube video that
[00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:32.560]   happens to be about something that's not tech is tech.
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:34.560]   Because the game itself is not tech.
[00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:37.040]   All right, all right, all right, all right, all right.
[00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:37.720]   All right.
[00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:38.220]   All right.
[00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:40.800]   I kind of tech biz to think someone's passing--
[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:41.300]   It's tech--
[00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:41.800]   It's tech--
[00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:42.300]   --you're growing.
[00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:42.800]   --it's tech biz.
[00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:43.300]   I give you that.
[00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:43.800]   It is tech biz.
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:45.620]   But we're not talking about the business aspect of it.
[00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:47.800]   How much money does this guy actually make from this thing?
[00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:48.080]   It's--
[00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:51.220]   No one knows at least a quarter of a billion a year,
[00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:52.440]   possibly three times.
[00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:55.160]   That is-- the company's valued at $1 billion.
[00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:56.320]   Oh, valued at--
[00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:56.820]   Value at $1 billion.
[00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:57.320]   Value at $1 billion.
[00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:57.880]   Value at $1 billion.
[00:08:57.880 --> 00:08:58.720]   We have to--
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:01.200]   --we're at their yearly sales are $1 billion.
[00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:01.760]   Really?
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:04.000]   So your value is what you make a year?
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.240]   Yeah, that typically.
[00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:07.200]   I thought it was like $4 to $1 or something like that.
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:08.100]   No, no, that's for sale.
[00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:09.700]   You might sell it for it at $1.
[00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:11.460]   But if you do valuation, it tends
[00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:13.140]   to be either the stock price multiplied
[00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:16.300]   by the number of shares outstanding or one-year sales.
[00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:17.820]   Then Pence, what you're talking about--
[00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:21.300]   I remember when valuation in the late '90s,
[00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:24.100]   they'd take the number of members and multiply it by--
[00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:25.060]   Yeah, well, that is--
[00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:26.820]   Well, that is a calculation that's valid.
[00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:28.620]   That's the Calcutanis calculation.
[00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:30.140]   We call it the Calcutanis.
[00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:32.980]   You can sell the company tomorrow for that amount of money.
[00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:35.860]   I think your value lies in your heart.
[00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:36.860]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:38.120]   Impossible.
[00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:40.080]   You know what I love is that Barritain Day is more
[00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.640]   lesbian than I am on this show.
[00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:43.480]   And I love everything about that.
[00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:45.000]   It's the amylus.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:45.800]   Good job.
[00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:46.840]   I give up.
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:47.340]   I give up.
[00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:48.340]   Let's go farm.
[00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:49.440]   And it's what's in your heart.
[00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:53.040]   All right, tell me, John, is this a tech story?
[00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:56.480]   From ours, Technica, bandwidth hogs join unicorns
[00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:58.520]   in the realm of mythical creatures.
[00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:01.320]   An analyst has had it with internet data caps,
[00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:04.720]   bandwidth hogs, that thing the Comcast promoted, you know,
[00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:07.020]   as a way to say, you don't--
[00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:08.500]   or not Comcast, 18--
[00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:09.500]   The Pacific Bell at the time.
[00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:10.580]   --Sivic Bell, yeah.
[00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:13.300]   Said don't use Comcast because that's bandwidth hogs.
[00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:18.140]   He says, it's a myth caps simply penalize heavy users who--
[00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:20.180]   John, this is something I've been saying for a long time--
[00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:24.740]   cause no problems for others.
[00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:27.140]   Now he's throwing down the gauntlet and challenging ISPs
[00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:28.060]   to turn over some data.
[00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:29.660]   He says, let's see.
[00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:30.580]   It's Benoit Felton.
[00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:32.220]   He's with the Yankee group.
[00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:34.880]   He covers fiber to the home issues.
[00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:36.760]   OK, I admit he's in Paris.
[00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:38.600]   But his bandwidth hogs challenges a product
[00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:41.360]   of his personal blog, Fiber Revolution.
[00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:42.120]   He's kind of with me.
[00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:44.120]   He says, there's plenty of bandwidth out there.
[00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:46.480]   This bandwidth hogs thing is a stalking horse
[00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:49.840]   for merely blocking competitive technologies
[00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:52.280]   like Skype, BitTorrent, stuff that
[00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:57.000]   would put Comcast or AT&T or Verizon out of business.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.360]   The bandwidth hogs is an imaginary creature
[00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:01.640]   for a digital age.
[00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:03.380]   Is that a tech story?
[00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:04.500]   Yeah, don't you think it is?
[00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:07.220]   Yeah, it's what we've been talking about for a long time.
[00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:09.220]   Devorak, why is that a tech story?
[00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:12.260]   It's a myth that an imaginary creature.
[00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:13.660]   He likes unicorns.
[00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:14.900]   I know this about John.
[00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:16.300]   He's always liked unicorns.
[00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:19.980]   So hey, I'm only the messenger here about the tech stories, OK?
[00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:22.140]   Imagine that some of these crazed downloads
[00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:25.820]   are BitTorrent fiends and that they have their clients set up
[00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:27.740]   to do most of the downloading in the wee hours
[00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:28.940]   as a BitTorrent fiend would do.
[00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:34.820]   I think there is such a thing as a bandwidth hog.
[00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:38.520]   I see the effects of it.
[00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:43.400]   For example, here at the house, my son cranked up something
[00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:44.200]   the other day.
[00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:48.760]   I was trying to do Skype and it just killed the whole network.
[00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:50.800]   That's an in-house bandwidth hogs.
[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:53.440]   Virtualized out on the bigger network.
[00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:55.560]   And that's why they have to do load balancing.
[00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:57.800]   Why do they have to have all these just a certain number
[00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:59.380]   of people on each one of these nodes
[00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:01.940]   if there wasn't some issue here?
[00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:05.000]   I think the Yankee Group historically
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:10.560]   has always used hyperbole to get attention to itself.
[00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:12.120]   It's a very common phenomenon with it.
[00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:13.920]   It worked.
[00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:17.440]   I think what this article also reveals
[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:20.680]   is maybe a need for at least more transparency, whether or not--
[00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:21.360]   That's what he says.
[00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:23.040]   --is claim is true.
[00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:24.080]   We can't tell.
[00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:27.240]   And what's something as important as an internet network,
[00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:29.840]   whether we're talking long haul or in a metro area
[00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:32.240]   or in the last mile or in John's house,
[00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:33.920]   we need to have some insight into this
[00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:35.800]   because it's becoming such a public good
[00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:37.440]   and a public infrastructure.
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:39.000]   We should know what its conditions are
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.440]   and what are the claims of those operating at our valid
[00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:43.040]   or simply anti-competitive.
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:45.080]   It speaks to the net neutrality issue
[00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:48.920]   because if you're going to create a regulation
[00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:51.680]   for net neutrality, it's in response to the notion
[00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:54.880]   that these companies are using bandwidth hogs
[00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:58.000]   as a stalking horse for what's really going on,
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.480]   which is they want to keep people from using Skype and stuff.
[00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:03.640]   Or a bit torrent because they try to sell you movies
[00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:05.680]   and that kind of thing.
[00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:06.120]   I'm with you.
[00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:10.840]   I think what we need if we want to have an informed conversation
[00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:13.840]   about net neutrality was we need numbers from these guys
[00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:16.320]   from Comcast, well, how bad is it?
[00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:17.400]   Show me your bandwidth.
[00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:18.640]   Show me the bandwidth.
[00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:20.880]   All the time, real time, numbers.
[00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:22.800]   I don't think they have numbers.
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:25.440]   They don't understand themselves.
[00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:27.640]   Well, and this is the conversation you and I have had
[00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:31.240]   for quite a bit, John, where my position is there isn't really
[00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:32.320]   a lack of bandwidth.
[00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:34.040]   There's plenty of bandwidth out there.
[00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:37.120]   That's not really what they're worried about.
[00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:41.800]   And I think caps are a huge stupid idea
[00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:44.280]   and that's what this guy's saying also.
[00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:45.720]   I don't mind tearing.
[00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:47.600]   I think it's reasonable to say, for instance,
[00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:50.720]   you pay 50 bucks, you get 10 megabits, you're 70 bucks,
[00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:52.040]   you pay it, get 100 megabits.
[00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:53.280]   That's fine.
[00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:54.960]   Pay for your bandwidth.
[00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:56.840]   But I don't think paying for the amount,
[00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:59.400]   it makes any sense at all.
[00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:01.360]   Well, I mean, of course, you're right.
[00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:04.080]   We have talked about this for the last 10 years
[00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:05.880]   and I'll bring up my argument again.
[00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:09.480]   OK, you might as well because we're rehashing, so go ahead.
[00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:12.280]   So in other words, what you're saying, it should be like water.
[00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:12.640]   Yes.
[00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:15.000]   So when you turn the faucet on, you get a bunch of water
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.200]   and you don't pay for using extra water.
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:19.120]   You just pay one flat fee.
[00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:21.720]   So for five bucks a month, they get all the water I can drink.
[00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:23.080]   Well, it doesn't work that way for water,
[00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:23.600]   either does it.
[00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:25.920]   You pay for the amount of water you use, but there's no cap.
[00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:26.360]   It doesn't say--
[00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:26.880]   It doesn't say--
[00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:28.320]   --charging by the bit.
[00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:29.600]   He's saying there's no--
[00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:31.320]   what Lewis is saying is that there's no limit,
[00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:33.080]   but if you're a big user, you're going
[00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:34.760]   to have to tear into a separate conifer to your level.
[00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:35.160]   I'm saying--
[00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:36.440]   and you're going to pay a little more.
[00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:39.200]   Scarcity is not real.
[00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:41.320]   Water is a scarce--
[00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:42.800]   at some point, a scarce resource.
[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:44.240]   Bits are not a scarce resource.
[00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:46.560]   We'll make more, John.
[00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:49.640]   But management of those bits at certain critical hours,
[00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:52.520]   peak hours, can be a scarce resource.
[00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:55.840]   The simultaneity of distributing bits
[00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:56.960]   might be a scarce resource.
[00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:59.480]   I think it's an artificially created scarcity,
[00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:01.400]   is my point, that there isn't a scarcity,
[00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:04.440]   that there's so much dark fiber, there's so much bandwidth,
[00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:05.360]   that it is not a scarcity.
[00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:07.080]   It costs money to light that stuff up.
[00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:09.360]   It costs-- I admit, there's a fixed capital--
[00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:10.200]   we've had this conversation--
[00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:11.720]   there's a fixed capital cost--
[00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:12.080]   It's maintenance.
[00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:13.080]   What about bare-trenders?
[00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:13.640]   Is that free?
[00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:14.400]   What about bare-trenders?
[00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:16.960]   What about the management of it, which is a human issue?
[00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:18.600]   Yeah, but the management is fairly cheap.
[00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:20.320]   Look at, how many people does it take
[00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:23.720]   to have a billion bits a second go across a network?
[00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:24.720]   Not that many.
[00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:27.720]   I don't need five more people because it's 10 billion bits.
[00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:29.320]   It's like a radio station charging
[00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:30.800]   for how many people listening to it.
[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:31.240]   I see.
[00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:33.960]   It doesn't cost you more to have a million listeners
[00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:37.000]   to a radio station because you're just putting the bits out
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:37.200]   there.
[00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:38.760]   So I think, yes, there's capital cost
[00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:42.720]   to building the routers and the fiber, which
[00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:43.400]   is by the way all more.
[00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:45.240]   It's going on a radio station because you
[00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:47.200]   have to have a bigger transmitter.
[00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:48.440]   No, wait a minute.
[00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:52.080]   You can't do it enough a lot and get a million people listening.
[00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:54.040]   Unless they all live within a block of the station.
[00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:54.600]   Right.
[00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:57.800]   So you have a transmitter that covers a metro area.
[00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:59.320]   If every single person in the city
[00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:01.720]   listens doesn't cost you any more than if one person in the city
[00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:03.720]   listens, right?
[00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:06.040]   Bandwidth is like that.
[00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:09.480]   That's the way you see it.
[00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:10.520]   That's right.
[00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:13.480]   I'm Leo LaPorte, and that's the way I see it.
[00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:14.520]   That's the way Susie's is.
[00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:15.480]   That was talking bleed.
[00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:16.080]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:17.440]   Exactly.
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:19.040]   Hey, I'm a lesbian.
[00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:20.440]   That's the way I see it.
[00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:21.560]   I'm going to get watched every time.
[00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:22.440]   Wait a minute.
[00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:22.880]   Wait a minute.
[00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:24.720]   Are you telling me you guys watch Glee?
[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:25.600]   Oh, yeah.
[00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:26.600]   Oh, it's the best.
[00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:27.600]   It's the best.
[00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:28.960]   It's the gayest show on television.
[00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:30.160]   It is.
[00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:30.760]   It's wonderful.
[00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:32.320]   And it's the nerdiest show in television.
[00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:32.680]   It is.
[00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:33.480]   It's about nerds.
[00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:34.960]   It's a complete nerd fest.
[00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:35.720]   What shows this?
[00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:37.400]   Glee?
[00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:38.040]   Glee.
[00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:38.520]   Glee.
[00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:39.600]   Glee is a glee club.
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:40.920]   Like Glee.
[00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:41.600]   It's wonderful.
[00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:42.960]   I can't watch that crap.
[00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:43.920]   I'm hooked on it.
[00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:45.640]   You can't stop watching it.
[00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:46.480]   You can't stop watching it.
[00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:48.640]   Especially because of Jane Lynch.
[00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:49.680]   She is brilliant.
[00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:50.520]   Unbelievably funny.
[00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:52.920]   That's the way I see it.
[00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:53.560]   What does that mean?
[00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:54.520]   Is that like C is like--
[00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:56.200]   Her last name is Speak to the C.
[00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:58.600]   So it's her cute little sign off.
[00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:00.560]   It's so god awful.
[00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:01.960]   You guys are hopeless.
[00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:03.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:05.560]   You know what I saw the other day speaking of TV,
[00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:07.120]   I thought this was very interesting.
[00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:11.480]   HP doing an ad for a printer with apps.
[00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:12.400]   HP, obviously.
[00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:12.920]   Very--
[00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:13.520]   Yeah.
[00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:14.680]   Have you seen this, Bertone?
[00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:18.800]   Obviously, it looked like an iPhone jammed inside of an HP
[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:19.280]   printer.
[00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:20.440]   There's an app for that there.
[00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:22.160]   There was Google Maps inside of that.
[00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:24.080]   There's a printer for that.
[00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:25.960]   It's very interesting.
[00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:27.000]   I think it's interesting.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.440]   I think you're Zapps everywhere.
[00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:31.840]   Because look how well Apple's done.
[00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:32.800]   There's an app for that.
[00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:36.680]   Clearly created this notion of small little applications.
[00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:38.080]   It's focused.
[00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:38.920]   Very focused.
[00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:39.520]   So if one of the--
[00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:40.600]   Twitter used to be.
[00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:44.520]   The ad that I saw was--
[00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:45.520]   for Fandango.
[00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:48.520]   So you could print a movie ticket on your printer.
[00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:49.800]   So you press the button.
[00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:51.880]   The printer knows what movies are showing.
[00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:53.200]   Pick a movie, big picture.
[00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:54.080]   Looks really cute.
[00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:54.600]   Push the button.
[00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:58.440]   The principal charges you somehow.
[00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:01.360]   So is this either-- is this a mini browser,
[00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:03.120]   or are these basically widgets--
[00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:03.760]   I don't know.
[00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:06.800]   --who's output you might want and pay for now?
[00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:08.080]   And by the way--
[00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:09.280]   They may not know themselves.
[00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:10.920]   Ford-- you know, we do ads for Ford Sync,
[00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:11.960]   which I'm about to do in a second.
[00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:14.880]   And Ford has announced they're going to open source.
[00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:16.800]   Ford Sync, they're going to have an SDK,
[00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:20.160]   and they're going to allow people to write apps for the car.
[00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:20.960]   Car apps.
[00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:22.080]   There's a car app for that.
[00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:24.080]   Well, there'd be an app that drives the car.
[00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:26.440]   There's like a look of belief in the guys on the bridge.
[00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:28.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:30.000]   We're going to have the Ted Kennedy app.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.320]   Are you feeling in the dumps?
[00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:32.160]   Are you depressed?
[00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:33.040]   You want to end it all?
[00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:33.720]   There's an app for that.
[00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:34.960]   Are there apps in the car?
[00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:38.040]   Is there apps in the car?
[00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:38.960]   I think this is great.
[00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:40.720]   I just love this.
[00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:44.640]   The app, like navigation, could get really cool with car apps.
[00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:47.400]   You do a lot of trip planning at home,
[00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:49.120]   and you want to get that inside your car,
[00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:50.880]   but you want to fumble with your phone.
[00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:54.280]   Are you tired of juggling your phone while you're driving?
[00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:55.360]   Well, then, you know--
[00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:56.200]   There's an app for that.
[00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:59.160]   --pre-establish your route, let you know where coffee shops are
[00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:02.680]   along the way, or augmented reality type things that might
[00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:05.320]   prompt you for a pull over here to do x, y, y, y.
[00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:06.160]   I want to heads up.
[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:08.480]   Displacture Mercedes showed this at the LA Auto Show.
[00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:10.800]   It was like a split screen display.
[00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:11.960]   It looked like it was heads up.
[00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:12.440]   I don't know.
[00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:13.760]   Ford's got something like that, too,
[00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:14.840]   by the way, on the drawing board.
[00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:16.200]   I think it's so cool.
[00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:17.040]   But let me do the--
[00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:17.880]   Split screen.
[00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:18.920]   What?
[00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:19.720]   I'm trying to imagine.
[00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:20.200]   You're driving.
[00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:21.200]   You're looking at multiple screens.
[00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:22.200]   So the whole idea of a heads up, though.
[00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:23.480]   Like, right now, I'm looking at Skype
[00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:23.840]   of stores.
[00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:24.800]   I'm driving like this.
[00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:25.480]   Right.
[00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:25.800]   But--
[00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:26.400]   --baritone day.
[00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:26.920]   Through it.
[00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:29.240]   Through it, you see the little old lady crossing the sidewalk.
[00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:30.320]   So there has a crosswalk.
[00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:31.000]   So you can stop.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.880]   So while you're watching your TV show on your windshield--
[00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:34.520]   There's a little--
[00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:36.240]   OK, imagine we see the old lady.
[00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:36.920]   What?
[00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:39.600]   Here's Baritone, a little old lady's walking across his head.
[00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:41.640]   And you go, oh, I better put on the brakes,
[00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:43.720]   because somebody's walking on Baritone day's head.
[00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:45.160]   No, no, no, better.
[00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:47.480]   There's an app for detecting old ladies.
[00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:48.040]   Ah.
[00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:49.320]   Why about it?
[00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:51.120]   It has access to your visual--
[00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:51.880]   No, with the radar--
[00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:53.800]   --frame with the new radars that they have.
[00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:56.280]   You'll be able to watch the TV on your windshield
[00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:57.440]   while looking for the old ladies.
[00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:58.800]   But if you don't see the old lady,
[00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:00.880]   the radar will stop the car anyway.
[00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:05.200]   Brad Templeton, who is, besides being the chair of the EFF,
[00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:07.920]   is also a scientist and a researcher.
[00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:09.040]   And he's an expert--
[00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:09.920]   And Canadian.
[00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:12.240]   And Canadian, of course, as all good people are.
[00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:12.760]   That's right.
[00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:14.200]   Are you wearing a took?
[00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:16.880]   This isn't quite really qualified as a took.
[00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:17.040]   But we can have--
[00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:17.800]   It's a tookish.
[00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:19.480]   I don't want to get you off the car app.
[00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:20.200]   It's tookish.
[00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:21.520]   Anyway, I talked to Brad.
[00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:23.760]   Brad is a tookette.
[00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:27.080]   Brad is an expert on exactly the subject, which
[00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:29.760]   is autonomous vehicles.
[00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:32.480]   And he says we're very, very-- he has a whole blog on this.
[00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:32.920]   Seriously?
[00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:34.280]   He said we're very, very close to cars.
[00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:34.780]   It's coming.
[00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:35.440]   I drove one.
[00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:36.200]   Well, I should say one--
[00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:37.480]   Well, in future of?
[00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:38.560]   Yeah, we did a segment.
[00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:41.080]   In June, it's a car at Stanford University.
[00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:44.280]   It won the DARPA Urban Challenge recently.
[00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:46.920]   And this car has hyper-accurate GPS.
[00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:52.040]   It's got a crazy LIDAR, like 3D light-based radar system.
[00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:54.880]   It can read road signals and land changes.
[00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:57.440]   It can detect other vehicles that actually swerved around a car.
[00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:59.480]   You don't need the road to be intelligent.
[00:20:59.480 --> 00:20:59.980]   No, no.
[00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:01.040]   I have stuff in it for the car.
[00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:02.920]   There was no intelligence embedded in the road.
[00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:05.640]   They taught the car and had enough scanning systems
[00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:08.000]   and processing power to interpret quickly enough.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:08.500]   Wow.
[00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:09.040]   This is my lane.
[00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:09.960]   This is not my lane.
[00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:10.720]   That's a person.
[00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:11.840]   This is not a person.
[00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:12.340]   Cool.
[00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:12.840]   Cool.
[00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:14.400]   That's the car, Tienen.
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:14.880]   You know what?
[00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:16.760]   You need to do your makeup with no cop stuff.
[00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:18.600]   We've now designed cars to let us text.
[00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:19.640]   Two thousand.
[00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:22.400]   And they've like Boston drivers since 2008.
[00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:23.840]   However, it's really--
[00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:26.080]   It's the political will that's going to stop it,
[00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:27.080]   because people are--
[00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:28.000]   It's going to freak people out.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.280]   It freaks people out.
[00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:31.840]   The idea that you're looking at something else, which people
[00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:33.400]   are doing anyway when they're driving,
[00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:34.800]   but that they're going to acknowledge?
[00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:35.300]   No.
[00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:38.000]   The car is more like a living room, where everything's
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.200]   in a circle, and you're all talking to each other,
[00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:41.280]   you're eating lunch, and whatever.
[00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:42.920]   And the car just takes you where you wanted to go.
[00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:43.360]   You say car.
[00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:44.320]   It's like a mobile living.
[00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:45.240]   It was like a mobile home.
[00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:45.920]   Oh my god.
[00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:48.040]   Bucky Fuller, what would he say?
[00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:49.520]   You know, the sad thing about Bucky
[00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:51.760]   designing that great car, it looked like a teardrop.
[00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:53.000]   Yeah, I saw that car.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:53.720]   It was gorgeous.
[00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:54.720]   Diamaxian.
[00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:55.720]   Diamaxian.
[00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:56.200]   Diamaxian.
[00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:58.360]   Sussi 11 people with three wheels.
[00:21:58.360 --> 00:21:58.860]   Yeah.
[00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:00.040]   It was a turning radius.
[00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:01.520]   Incredible turn radius.
[00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:02.880]   And it was perfectly aerodynamics.
[00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:04.320]   It was super efficient.
[00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:07.000]   Unfortunately, the first guy drives it,
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.720]   gets in a fatal auto wreck.
[00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:10.320]   Kind of kills the interest in the Diamaxian.
[00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:12.680]   Make sure your early adopters are--
[00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:14.160]   He forgot the seat belts, I think.
[00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:15.480]   Or super human.
[00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:16.560]   Super human, what do you get?
[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:19.040]   I would get in a moving living room.
[00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:20.120]   Wouldn't.
[00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:20.920]   That's the future.
[00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:21.720]   They'll be whiskey.
[00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:22.800]   Now, here's my prediction.
[00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:23.320]   They'll be whiskey.
[00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:24.320]   The future.
[00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:25.320]   That's the future.
[00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:25.800]   That's the future.
[00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:26.800]   Moving living rooms.
[00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:28.200]   We'll be right that one down.
[00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:29.240]   Forget flying cars.
[00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:31.240]   I want living rooms on wheels.
[00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:32.360]   No, but here's the thing.
[00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:34.280]   OK, watch carefully, because everybody--
[00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:35.880]   look, the technology's imminent
[00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:37.080]   within the next couple of years.
[00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:38.320]   Everybody knows it.
[00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:41.760]   Everybody also knows there's no way those old men in the Senate
[00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:43.440]   are going to make this possible.
[00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:45.000]   Right.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   You can't let a car drive a chance.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   I did.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:48.360]   That's why--
[00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:49.600]   I win a bago, is it?
[00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:51.920]   What happened to people farming?
[00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:54.320]   We get a lot of money from the petrol industry.
[00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:56.640]   And they like the cars being driven by more.
[00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:57.520]   Exactly.
[00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:00.560]   So watch, because what I think will happen
[00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:02.800]   is if somebody's very clever is out there,
[00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:04.720]   is the gradualization of this.
[00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:05.960]   And I think Ford's saying things like this.
[00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:06.920]   I do gradualize this.
[00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:07.840]   You gradualize this.
[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:09.400]   How do you gradualize a living room?
[00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:10.240]   They've already done it.
[00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:11.160]   You just put an automatic--
[00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:12.320]   You don't notice it.
[00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:13.920]   Parking cars that park themselves.
[00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:15.280]   They park themselves.
[00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:16.480]   That's how it starts.
[00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:18.400]   Heads up, radar systems in cars.
[00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:20.600]   It's already starting collision detection systems
[00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:21.240]   already in cars.
[00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:23.560]   So you have a car backed autonomous--
[00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:24.560]   Yeah.
[00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:26.600]   We couldn't get cars out of aluminum.
[00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:28.440]   How are we going to eat cars that are this amazing?
[00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:28.960]   No.
[00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:29.520]   You got it.
[00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:31.200]   Volvo has this bliss system, which
[00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:34.080]   actually affords a Taurus SHO that
[00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:38.200]   will tell you if somebody is in your blind spot.
[00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:41.920]   The Prius will slow down if you drift out of your lane,
[00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:44.040]   tighten your seat belts, change the braking.
[00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:44.560]   That's true.
[00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:45.480]   I've experienced that.
[00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:47.520]   All of this stuff is here, and it's
[00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:49.560]   going to gradually, I think, be--
[00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:50.840]   so people get comfortable with it.
[00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:52.160]   And somebody in the chat room just
[00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:56.000]   said cruise control, which is a great system that's
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.760]   been there for quite some time.
[00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:00.440]   I don't actually see the massive opposition to this
[00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:01.320]   that you do, Leo.
[00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:02.120]   It's sold right.
[00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:05.240]   People can sell this as safer, because the machines
[00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:05.440]   are quicker.
[00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:06.800]   The only opposition very soon they
[00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:08.880]   would come from if it threatened the oil business.
[00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:10.360]   That's what you have to worry about.
[00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:11.800]   And it used to be the same business.
[00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:14.200]   And if it doesn't threaten them, then it has a chance.
[00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:15.480]   That's not going to keep a brother.
[00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:17.440]   This encourages driving by saying, look,
[00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:20.160]   you can actually do your homework or your office
[00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:22.600]   work in your car, just like driving a--
[00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:24.120]   you know, riding in public transit.
[00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:26.080]   If anything, I encourage people to keep their cars
[00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:28.640]   rather than doing something else, because they're not
[00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:30.520]   wasting time anymore, quote unquote.
[00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:32.560]   GM's new lobbyist, Pardon, dethirst.
[00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:33.560]   That was very interesting.
[00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:34.040]   That was good.
[00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:34.560]   That was good.
[00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:35.060]   That was good.
[00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:35.560]   It was really good.
[00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:36.060]   Well done.
[00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:36.560]   Well done.
[00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:36.560]   Really?
[00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:37.560]   You really have it.
[00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:38.640]   Man, I'm just--
[00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:40.880]   One minute I'm planting an artichoke on a roof,
[00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:43.960]   and dancing in a circle, the moon, and the next minute,
[00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:45.720]   I'm like, GM needs cards.
[00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:47.760]   I love it.
[00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:49.640]   I am-- actually, I'm watching Disney's
[00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:50.840]   Future of Transportation.
[00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:52.360]   It's fascinating.
[00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:53.760]   And Disney would know.
[00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:54.720]   Disney would know.
[00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:56.600]   This probably is something that they played it.
[00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:58.000]   This is on the Disney channel, you mean?
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:58.320]   No, no.
[00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:00.760]   It's 1958 Disneyland TV show episode
[00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:02.600]   called Magic Highway USA.
[00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:03.800]   You can see it on YouTube.
[00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:04.240]   OK.
[00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:05.640]   An exploration of the possible--
[00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:06.800]   '50s, so that was what?
[00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:10.280]   51 years ago, and how far have we gotten?
[00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:11.520]   We got Ford's sink.
[00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:12.680]   Look at traffic density.
[00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:14.040]   Slow.
[00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:15.040]   Look at that.
[00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:15.960]   It slows down.
[00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:16.800]   Magic highway.
[00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:18.800]   51 years ago.
[00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:19.640]   Yeah.
[00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:20.480]   Yeah.
[00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:21.000]   Let me--
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:21.720]   I can't hear what it's got.
[00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:23.240]   The car that parks itself.
[00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:24.280]   I think that's pretty good.
[00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:26.560]   You know, the thing about the car that parks itself,
[00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:28.760]   I'd like to know, can you take your driver's license test
[00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:32.360]   with that car and post a button?
[00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:33.840]   That's great.
[00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:35.280]   That's how they're going to sell it?
[00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:36.080]   How?
[00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:37.440]   They're going to say--
[00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:39.120]   they've got to get the DMV to say, OK,
[00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:40.560]   if you have a self-driving car, you
[00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:42.560]   don't have to take the test, or we'll just let the car drive.
[00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:43.440]   Oh, wow.
[00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:44.760]   Then you don't have to do the DMV.
[00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:46.680]   It's the only place where people meet each other than the ice
[00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:47.200]   cream shop.
[00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:49.240]   Otherwise, our culture would never mix.
[00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:50.360]   DMV horrible.
[00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:51.080]   You're right, though.
[00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:51.880]   It's all we got.
[00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:54.480]   That's what we got left of the supposed democratic--
[00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:55.600]   No, I was in the DMV.
[00:25:55.600 --> 00:26:00.480]   I didn't know people like that were alive in this world.
[00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:03.240]   It's like you feel like everybody there is alien,
[00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:04.640]   like from another planet.
[00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:06.040]   And I think that about you, too.
[00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:06.560]   Do you think so?
[00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:08.880]   Do they look at me and say, I didn't know he was in this area.
[00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:10.640]   People who think someone isn't like them,
[00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:13.720]   they can't handle it, whatever that thing is.
[00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:15.560]   It's because of those hats.
[00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:16.080]   Me?
[00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:16.720]   It's the tukes.
[00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:18.560]   I'm just like, where am I alien this right here?
[00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:19.440]   It's the tukes.
[00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:20.280]   All right, let me take it.
[00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:21.120]   What happened to your love boat--
[00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:22.120]   It's the secret bipod.
[00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:23.640]   It's what happens to your own thirst
[00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:25.320]   and how old is the third scarf?
[00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:27.480]   Dvorak, where did that go?
[00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:28.200]   Oh, lovey.
[00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:28.560]   Yeah.
[00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:29.520]   Where's your scarf, lovey?
[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:30.480]   Where's your scarf?
[00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:31.600]   I'm wearing a scarf.
[00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:33.800]   You should be wearing a scarf.
[00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:36.240]   Come on, lovey.
[00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:37.080]   Let's take a break.
[00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:37.920]   That's the price I'm looking for.
[00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:39.520]   It's time for me to make some money.
[00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:41.400]   I don't know about you, but I'd like to make some money
[00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:42.080]   with this show.
[00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:45.120]   So I'm going to talk about Ford Cinque.
[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:47.000]   How about that?
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:47.560]   Look at that.
[00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:48.480]   It's amazing.
[00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:49.480]   It's actually--
[00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:51.000]   It is kind of what we were talking about.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.040]   It's the precursor to all of this.
[00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:55.120]   Ford Cinque, the idea behind Ford Cinque
[00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:57.200]   is it's a hands-free system.
[00:26:57.200 --> 00:27:00.280]   Let's keep your hands on the wheel and your eyes on the road
[00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:01.920]   and yet do so many of those things that
[00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:05.200]   are distracting normally with your voice.
[00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:06.360]   It's great voice recognition.
[00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:07.520]   Of course, first thing you do is you
[00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:08.720]   pair your Bluetooth phone to it.
[00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:10.240]   Up to 25 different phones.
[00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:13.440]   I've got my Droid and my iPhone paired to it.
[00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:15.160]   It will play music from it.
[00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:19.440]   The phone using Bluetooth music profiles on an 8-2DP.
[00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:21.200]   It might be a 2-DP.
[00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:25.520]   It will also, if your airbags deploy, call 911 for you.
[00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:27.120]   It has-- the sync has its own GPS.
[00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:29.840]   So we'll send the GPS coordinates for where the car is.
[00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:32.040]   Play a recorded message to give you a chance to say,
[00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:33.920]   help me, help me.
[00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:36.880]   It-- can you get vehicle history reports?
[00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:38.200]   I mean, this thing is amazing.
[00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:40.880]   Now, that's just kind of the utilitarian stuff.
[00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:43.480]   There's also-- they call it Travel Link.
[00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:45.240]   I was playing with this yesterday.
[00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:46.440]   And I just show my wife.
[00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:47.120]   I say, watch this.
[00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:47.960]   How do I press the button?
[00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:49.560]   I say, Travel Link.
[00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:50.400]   And then it goes boom.
[00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:52.920]   And I say, five-day weather forecast.
[00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:54.280]   I get a five-day weather forecast.
[00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:57.400]   I say, football scores, NFL.
[00:27:57.400 --> 00:27:58.520]   I get the NFL scores.
[00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:02.040]   I say, how's my fantasy team doing?
[00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:03.120]   It'll tell you that.
[00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:06.040]   Movie times, it's got GPS.
[00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:07.160]   You say, I want to go somewhere.
[00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:08.840]   It gives you the destination.
[00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:11.200]   It's not a big, expensive GPS unit.
[00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:13.560]   It does it itself, turn by turn directions,
[00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:14.960]   through your voice and the sync voice.
[00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:15.920]   And I like the sync lady.
[00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:17.240]   I'm getting a little crush on her, too.
[00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:18.920]   I want you to take a look at Fort Sink.
[00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:21.800]   You've got to just, I think, a day or two more
[00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:29.120]   to win a new nano or a zoom by going to syncmyridepodcast.com.
[00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:31.120]   Syncmyridepodcast.com.
[00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:33.160]   You can learn about Fort Sink there.
[00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:34.240]   And you can enter to win.
[00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:36.280]   All you have to do is tweet with the hashtag,
[00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:38.200]   #SinkMyRidePodcast.
[00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:42.280]   Something like, I'm listening to a car wreck on Twitch this week,
[00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:44.560]   pouncing my ride podcast, and you'll be in the drawing.
[00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:46.680]   They've got 15 nanos or zoos to give away contest
[00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:48.680]   on the weekend of December 9th.
[00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:51.320]   Your chance to tweet and win.
[00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:55.120]   We thank Fort so much for their faith in new media.
[00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:56.560]   Let me tell you something.
[00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:59.920]   That's a pretty big deal when a company like Ford buys ads.
[00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:01.840]   And it's not just by the way, on the Twitch network there,
[00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:04.640]   I see their ads on Dignation and all over the place.
[00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:05.800]   I think they really get it.
[00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:08.200]   They say, you know, this is real.
[00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:09.120]   So thank you, Ford.
[00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:12.480]   And folks, do me a favor.
[00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:14.000]   Syncmyridepodcast.com.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:15.600]   Just check it out.
[00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:17.920]   I can see the reality show next.
[00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:18.640]   What's that?
[00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:19.840]   You know, Pimp MyRide.
[00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:20.560]   Syncmyride.
[00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:21.560]   Syncmyride.
[00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:25.080]   Like, what's the crazy apps, robot destroying app
[00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:27.160]   you've come up with for your car.
[00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:29.040]   Now, we're going to have cars that like attack other--
[00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:30.080]   where they're going to ejection seats.
[00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:30.560]   Well, it's interesting.
[00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:33.000]   I was talking to Chris Dibona of Google.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.160]   He was on our Floss Weekly show.
[00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:35.640]   He's their open source guy.
[00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:36.760]   And he says, yeah, I actually have
[00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:39.920]   been talking with Ford about this.
[00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:41.880]   And their concern is they don't want people
[00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:46.880]   to write apps that would tweak the fuel ratios or change--
[00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:49.200]   They don't make the car more fuel efficient than they did.
[00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:51.240]   No, usually what happens is less.
[00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:54.560]   They're going to over-job like what people do with their computer
[00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:55.160]   processes.
[00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:55.720]   Overclock.
[00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:56.240]   Overclock.
[00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:56.720]   Overclock.
[00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:57.240]   Exactly.
[00:29:57.240 --> 00:29:58.000]   Make it a richer.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:58.480]   That's great.
[00:29:58.480 --> 00:29:59.280]   You know that, John.
[00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:00.320]   Aren't you a hot rod guy?
[00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:01.080]   Were you--
[00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:02.080]   Oh, dear.
[00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:02.580]   Yeah.
[00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:03.080]   Oh, dear.
[00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:04.120]   I thought that you did that, Leo.
[00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:04.720]   That's John.
[00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:06.520]   There's a voodoo doll in John's window.
[00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:07.400]   That's good.
[00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:08.920]   I used to be a hot rod guy.
[00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:12.920]   So when you enrich the fuel mixture to make it go fast
[00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:14.360]   or something like that--
[00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:17.560]   I get some nitrous oxide and pump it in straight.
[00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:17.920]   There you go.
[00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:18.400]   Did you do that?
[00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:19.760]   You blow up the thing.
[00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:21.840]   Did you drive a nitro-fueled funny car?
[00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:23.000]   Sunday, Sunday, Sunday.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.200]   Watch John Z. Devorak around the 15 mile level.
[00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:28.480]   And his nitro-fueled funny car goes round and round and round.
[00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:30.120]   Oh, the humanity.
[00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:30.600]   Was that you?
[00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:31.680]   Tom Campbell.
[00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:32.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:34.120]   Top of the hill daily city.
[00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:35.480]   Well, he did all the funny car.
[00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:37.120]   He also had that voice that you just did.
[00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:39.080]   Sunday, Sunday, Sunday.
[00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:40.920]   Oh, I love that stuff.
[00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:42.120]   I grew up on that stuff.
[00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:44.240]   I mean, it never happened to him, I wonder.
[00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:45.480]   Yeah, I wonder too.
[00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:47.920]   He was a kind of an interesting-- it was a DJ in San Jose.
[00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:51.960]   He did very famous ads in San Francisco for a stereo store
[00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:54.560]   called Matthews, top of the hill daily city.
[00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:57.320]   And there's-- somewhere around there,
[00:30:57.320 --> 00:30:59.240]   a lot of outtakes of this, because what he would do
[00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:01.600]   is he'd go to the Matthews store, say, hi, Tom Campbell.
[00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:03.160]   And for Matthews, top of the hill daily city.
[00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:05.160]   And then he would start talking to people as they go out.
[00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:09.360]   And people would say rude thing and stuff.
[00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:11.280]   And he'd just keep on going.
[00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:15.320]   He was also famous for having people call his show
[00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:17.920]   and give him sob stories like, I got a hot date
[00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:20.280]   with my girlfriend tonight, my car broke down.
[00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:22.080]   And he'd give him the shit he was going.
[00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:22.680]   No.
[00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:23.040]   Yeah.
[00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:26.320]   No, he had actually perfected the networking thing.
[00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:29.040]   He had phones in his car.
[00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:30.840]   He had like early mobile phones.
[00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:31.920]   He was very interesting to go.
[00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:34.600]   He had old car phones, the old analog ones.
[00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:36.120]   And all kinds of weird stuff.
[00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:38.600]   So you could always get a hold of them somehow.
[00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:40.680]   So he could be just basically working 21st.
[00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:42.120]   He kind of like you, Leo.
[00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:43.820]   Or Beritunde, who I don't know how--
[00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:46.000]   Working all day, all night.
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.680]   This is-- are you-- is he a super tweeter?
[00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:50.760]   I tweet a lot, but it's very hard to keep up.
[00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:53.720]   Beritunde is not only tweeting at all times.
[00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:55.320]   He's tweeting as we speak.
[00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:56.440]   A.P.T.
[00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:57.280]   I don't think Mamet--
[00:31:57.280 --> 00:31:57.840]   He's on multiple platforms.
[00:31:57.840 --> 00:31:59.200]   I don't think that's exactly what Mamet said,
[00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:00.200]   but it's close, yeah.
[00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:02.520]   Just updating him for the 21st century.
[00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:03.120]   Pretty much.
[00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:04.880]   I went to a mopar alley one.
[00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:07.520]   So we saw like small cars and they had--
[00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:09.680]   there's this one car with a record player in it
[00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:12.360]   before there was, you know, cassette tapes.
[00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:14.200]   Like that wasn't just put in aftermarket.
[00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:15.280]   Like it came with the car.
[00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:17.160]   And they played upside down?
[00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:20.080]   Yeah, well, it would skip otherwise.
[00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:22.160]   It was humongous.
[00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:23.880]   No, the very first-- because they didn't--
[00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:25.120]   actually, it's quite famous.
[00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:26.840]   I think it's-- they talk about it in Empire of the Air.
[00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:29.400]   Before there were car radios, people wanted to--
[00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:31.120]   before, you know, radio was common.
[00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:32.400]   People wanted music in their cars.
[00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:32.840]   Right.
[00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:35.440]   They tried putting Victrolas in the cars.
[00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:36.440]   It wasn't a good idea.
[00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:38.440]   We just kind of like a lot of web video shows.
[00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:40.200]   You remember that, John?
[00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:41.240]   You remember hearing about it.
[00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:42.480]   You don't remember actually driving it.
[00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:43.320]   I never had one.
[00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:44.280]   Well, I remember hearing about it.
[00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:45.280]   Yeah.
[00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:47.240]   Because I do remember though, when they early,
[00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:48.440]   they had the early cartridges.
[00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:49.520]   They used to have those--
[00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:52.360]   like a car that you have in a radio station.
[00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:56.160]   They had those in cars that were pre-8-track.
[00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:58.840]   Oh, they weren't 8-tracks, but they were like 8-tracks.
[00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:00.560]   No, they weren't 8-- well, no, they were like--
[00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:01.840]   they radio-car'd.
[00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:02.360]   How fun.
[00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:04.560]   In the station, you shove a car and you pull a lever
[00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:06.240]   and it chakes the thing go.
[00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:07.520]   Go chunk.
[00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:09.600]   Well, the reason was until Transistors came along,
[00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:11.360]   you really couldn't put a radio in a car
[00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:13.720]   because it had vacuum tubes instead of it just shake loose.
[00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:17.440]   So it wasn't until the '50s when the transistor came along
[00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:19.600]   and radios came along and they put radios in cars.
[00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:22.080]   So they had to figure out all sorts of ways of doing it.
[00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:25.080]   Talking about these apps, there's an article in the--
[00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:27.320]   did you want to start another thought, John?
[00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:28.040]   Go ahead, please.
[00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:29.760]   Well, I know I was going to start another topic.
[00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:30.260]   Yes.
[00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:32.260]   Go ahead.
[00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:33.260]   Well, I was going to say--
[00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:34.260]   Well, I was going to say--
[00:33:34.260 --> 00:33:35.260]   you see, there's quite a few of them here.
[00:33:35.260 --> 00:33:37.260]   We should be talking about the Google public DNS.
[00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:38.260]   This is interesting.
[00:33:38.260 --> 00:33:40.260]   I'm an OpenDNS fan.
[00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:41.260]   I use OpenDNS.com.
[00:33:41.260 --> 00:33:42.260]   And you use it?
[00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:43.260]   Yeah.
[00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:44.260]   Oh, yeah.
[00:33:44.260 --> 00:33:45.260]   And you know why I use it?
[00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:49.260]   OpenDNS, it's a replacement for your DNS server from your ISP.
[00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:50.260]   Right.
[00:33:50.260 --> 00:33:52.260]   Have you tested it?
[00:33:52.260 --> 00:33:53.260]   Yeah.
[00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:56.260]   It's faster, more reliable, and one of the reasons I started using it
[00:33:56.260 --> 00:33:59.260]   is about six months ago, there was a significant DNS flaw.
[00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:01.260]   Security flaw.
[00:34:01.260 --> 00:34:05.260]   And many internet service providers did not fix it, but OpenDNS not
[00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:07.260]   only had it-- was it fixed?
[00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:09.260]   It had been fixed before the flaw was discovered.
[00:34:09.260 --> 00:34:11.260]   So it never had the vulnerability.
[00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:13.260]   It is faster often.
[00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:14.260]   And they also have a nice feature.
[00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:17.260]   If you created a count with OpenDNS, you can use it for filtering.
[00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:20.260]   So I keep my kids from playing Farmville with OpenDNS.
[00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:21.260]   [Whistles]
[00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:22.260]   So it's got some nice features.
[00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:24.260]   You keep them from Farmville because--
[00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:25.260]   No, I don't, actually.
[00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:31.260]   So Preston Gralla wrote a story in computer world, and he said that he
[00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:36.260]   tested OpenDNS against Google DNS and found that Open was better,
[00:34:36.260 --> 00:34:38.260]   and you should just skip the Google DNS.
[00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:41.260]   But I find it hard to believe that anything could be possibly
[00:34:41.260 --> 00:34:44.260]   faster than Google with all the bandwidth they sit on.
[00:34:44.260 --> 00:34:47.260]   I think OpenDNS is better because they've been around longer and
[00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:48.260]   they understand it better.
[00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:51.260]   And then the Google servers, I mean, they may not necessarily be
[00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:54.260]   physically closer to your home than if they just started this.
[00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:57.260]   Maybe they haven't fully deployed it across all their massive Google
[00:34:57.260 --> 00:34:58.260]   infrastructure.
[00:34:58.260 --> 00:35:00.260]   So it could get faster over time and something, I'm guessing.
[00:35:00.260 --> 00:35:03.260]   Because I read that same story and it looked like Google had no real
[00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:06.260]   speed advantage even though the point was supposed to be speed.
[00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:08.260]   Well, here's a really interesting question.
[00:35:08.260 --> 00:35:10.260]   Why is Google doing OpenDNS?
[00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:12.260]   Obviously, they didn't use studies.
[00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:13.260]   People.
[00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:14.260]   What we talked about this yesterday.
[00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:15.260]   Yeah, two weeks.
[00:35:15.260 --> 00:35:16.260]   Yeah, two weeks.
[00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:17.260]   What'd you say?
[00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:18.260]   They're just being nice.
[00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:19.260]   Yeah, they're nice.
[00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:20.260]   Oh, crap.
[00:35:20.260 --> 00:35:22.260]   [Laughs]
[00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:24.260]   Well, why do you think they might be doing it?
[00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:25.260]   Market research.
[00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:28.260]   Yeah, they could find, they could know everything about where you go.
[00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:29.260]   Yeah, Jeff Tarves made them.
[00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:32.260]   If you care about where you go, they just want to see trends and where
[00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:33.260]   people are going in general.
[00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:36.260]   You know, the idea that they're tracking any one person into any
[00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:40.260]   extreme, I think, is kind of a, is not what they're, they don't want to do that.
[00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:41.260]   Don't you, they're tracking you, John.
[00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:42.260]   You're the only person in the room.
[00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:43.260]   I mean, they might track you.
[00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:44.260]   Yeah.
[00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:45.260]   No, I think it's you.
[00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:46.260]   They hate.
[00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:47.260]   [Laughs]
[00:35:47.260 --> 00:35:48.260]   It's you.
[00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:50.260]   I've asked them to do it because I need to know what you're up to it all
[00:35:50.260 --> 00:35:52.260]   times because I need to know.
[00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:54.260]   You know, can I track Taylor Swift?
[00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:55.260]   That's all I want to do.
[00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:56.260]   Taylor Swift.
[00:35:56.260 --> 00:35:57.260]   Taylor Swift.
[00:35:57.260 --> 00:35:58.260]   Taylor Swift.
[00:35:58.260 --> 00:36:02.260]   The, I think the, the truth is that Google does track you, John.
[00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:06.260]   If you look at your Google history, log into your Google account, you, they know
[00:36:06.260 --> 00:36:07.260]   exactly where you've been everywhere.
[00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:09.260]   You've been everything you've searched for for the last five years.
[00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:11.260]   I'm in your phone company as we learn.
[00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:13.260]   It gets in touch with me when I need to talk.
[00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:15.260]   When you, we will talk.
[00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:16.260]   We will call.
[00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:17.260]   You need not call us.
[00:36:17.260 --> 00:36:18.260]   We know where you live.
[00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:21.260]   The only advantage of Google DNS, go ahead and have a drink.
[00:36:21.260 --> 00:36:22.260]   Enjoy yourself.
[00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:25.260]   I was just going to say, and your cell phone company has all of your voice
[00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:28.260]   and yells, John, and someday those are going to be really fun to hear.
[00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:33.260]   Isn't that great because I, that's one of the reasons I don't have a machine on my, on
[00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:34.260]   my phone.
[00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:35.260]   I don't use voicemail at all.
[00:36:35.260 --> 00:36:37.260]   I've just learned that Taylor Swift is underage.
[00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:39.260]   I have not been tracking Taylor Swift.
[00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:40.260]   Thank you very much.
[00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:41.260]   I just heard she's 19.
[00:36:41.260 --> 00:36:42.260]   She's 19.
[00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:43.260]   That's cool.
[00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:45.260]   Well did with Kanye West in my mind for all of them.
[00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:46.260]   I know.
[00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:47.260]   She's 19.
[00:36:47.260 --> 00:36:48.260]   That's so sad.
[00:36:48.260 --> 00:36:50.260]   You know, it's over before it begins.
[00:36:50.260 --> 00:36:52.260]   That was the whole thing was a setup, right?
[00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:53.260]   No.
[00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:54.260]   I don't know.
[00:36:54.260 --> 00:36:55.260]   What do you think?
[00:36:55.260 --> 00:36:56.260]   They have the same agent.
[00:36:56.260 --> 00:36:57.260]   Oh, I know that.
[00:36:57.260 --> 00:36:59.260]   Whoever heard of Taylor Swift before it happened.
[00:36:59.260 --> 00:37:00.260]   Now she's huge.
[00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:04.260]   And they are hoping she crossed over into the urban audience.
[00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:05.260]   And it sure didn't hurt Kanye.
[00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:06.260]   Everybody, you know, that's Kanye.
[00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:08.260]   Everybody loves Kanye because he's that kind of guy.
[00:37:08.260 --> 00:37:10.260]   And he got publicity from the bottom.
[00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:13.260]   I don't, well, I have no, first of all, I don't know anything.
[00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:16.260]   That never stopped me from sharing my opinion before, but I just want to throw
[00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:17.260]   that out there.
[00:37:17.260 --> 00:37:18.260]   I don't.
[00:37:18.260 --> 00:37:20.020]   Yeah, because you're a brother.
[00:37:20.020 --> 00:37:21.260]   You might know what really happened.
[00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:22.260]   Right.
[00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:23.260]   But we all know each other.
[00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:24.260]   Let me tell you about Taylor.
[00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:25.260]   Is it on the grapevine?
[00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:27.260]   Yeah, it's a history of weird behavior.
[00:37:27.260 --> 00:37:30.260]   And I'm looking for the tech angle on this, but just since we're talking about it.
[00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:31.260]   They used a microphone.
[00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:37.260]   He's an unstable, ego maniacal, trouble person.
[00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:39.260]   And so this doesn't quite seem out of character for him.
[00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:43.700]   He has a history of interrupting folks and just being sort of a bad person during award
[00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:46.060]   shows and is trying to steal a spotlight because he's full of himself.
[00:37:46.060 --> 00:37:50.060]   But you don't you think it was a little odd that they sat him so close to the stage?
[00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:52.060]   Yeah, with the same age.
[00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:57.060]   It's like three agents for all the people in that room.
[00:37:57.060 --> 00:37:59.060]   So I don't think that's the whole...
[00:37:59.060 --> 00:38:00.060]   Good point.
[00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:02.060]   Do you really think that agents actually do any work?
[00:38:02.060 --> 00:38:04.060]   Do you think they spend any time trying to make things better?
[00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:05.060]   Yeah, they have to work.
[00:38:05.060 --> 00:38:06.060]   They do.
[00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:07.060]   They come up with schemes like just to get publicity.
[00:38:07.060 --> 00:38:10.060]   They want to know that agents don't deal with publicity.
[00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:11.060]   That's a different kind of person.
[00:38:11.060 --> 00:38:14.060]   I don't think agents spend their time trying to get publicity.
[00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:15.060]   I think a publicist.
[00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:16.060]   Do you have a manager?
[00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:17.060]   I wouldn't give him that kind of credit.
[00:38:17.060 --> 00:38:19.060]   Do you have a manager or an agent?
[00:38:19.060 --> 00:38:23.060]   I no longer have a manager of a couple of agents, but I don't have a manager anymore.
[00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:26.060]   I'm maybe have a manager or an agent and all that stuff.
[00:38:26.060 --> 00:38:32.060]   I recently acquired managers and I'm working on an agent.
[00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:35.060]   I know I know Devorak has a book agent.
[00:38:35.060 --> 00:38:36.060]   Yeah.
[00:38:36.060 --> 00:38:38.060]   Is that something you need?
[00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:40.060]   And Bertrand, are you fighting the managers or helping you?
[00:38:40.060 --> 00:38:43.060]   Because you seem like you could manage your managers probably.
[00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:48.060]   No, I mean, I went for a very long time without any official infrastructure.
[00:38:48.060 --> 00:38:53.060]   It was like me and Google and Word of mouth, you know, physical and virtual Word of mouth
[00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:54.060]   hooking me up with gigs.
[00:38:54.060 --> 00:39:00.060]   But it got to a point where I couldn't handle just the flow of like sort of demand and gigs
[00:39:00.060 --> 00:39:03.060]   and everything and managers have been pretty helpful.
[00:39:03.060 --> 00:39:04.060]   Right.
[00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:06.060]   So having somebody to shift things off to as well as just helping.
[00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:09.860]   Exactly what you just said and I think this scales all the way up to Taylor Swift.
[00:39:09.860 --> 00:39:13.860]   These kinds of folks are great when you have inflow coming and you need somebody.
[00:39:13.860 --> 00:39:14.860]   It's like outsourcing.
[00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:16.860]   It's like you're India, you're personal India.
[00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:17.860]   And then we can show business.
[00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:21.860]   But basically they're not going to come in and say, let's change your career.
[00:39:21.860 --> 00:39:22.860]   I mean, they're just not that good.
[00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:23.860]   Most of the time I would.
[00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:25.860]   They're not that good.
[00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:29.860]   Spiphone app steals personal data from all iPhones.
[00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:30.860]   Whoo hoo.
[00:39:30.860 --> 00:39:32.860]   Was this the indie app store?
[00:39:32.860 --> 00:39:33.860]   No.
[00:39:33.860 --> 00:39:34.860]   Yeah, I want this.
[00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:36.860]   Is the apple approved that?
[00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:37.860]   That'd be awesome.
[00:39:37.860 --> 00:39:38.860]   What is this story?
[00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:39.860]   This is bizarre.
[00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:41.860]   This comes from Taranfx.com.
[00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:45.860]   I don't know the site.
[00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:49.860]   Who was that someone shouting loud that only it's not in English.
[00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:51.620]   I don't know what language this is.
[00:39:51.620 --> 00:39:54.140]   That's only jail breaking makes iPhones insecure.
[00:39:54.140 --> 00:39:59.900]   They're talking about the Australian virus that took advantage of jailbroken iPhones and
[00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:01.860]   the fact that people weren't installing it.
[00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:04.860]   This phrase has jailbreak, virgin and leak in it.
[00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:05.860]   It's a little.
[00:40:05.860 --> 00:40:07.860]   You just skipped to the second graph in this story.
[00:40:07.860 --> 00:40:08.860]   A Swiss phone development.
[00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:09.860]   Thank you.
[00:40:09.860 --> 00:40:10.860]   Thank you.
[00:40:10.860 --> 00:40:13.220]   Is this an onion joke?
[00:40:13.220 --> 00:40:14.220]   Is this an onion article?
[00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:15.220]   I think it might be.
[00:40:15.220 --> 00:40:17.860]   No, we're much better than this.
[00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:22.380]   Swiss phone developer has unveiled a new app that is capable of harvesting huge amounts
[00:40:22.380 --> 00:40:27.940]   of personal data from iPhones using the public API exposed by Apple's SDK.
[00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:35.740]   Now in order for a spy phone to work, doesn't need jailbreaking or any exploits, you rely
[00:40:35.740 --> 00:40:38.420]   as it says on the iPhones usability and depth of features.
[00:40:38.420 --> 00:40:41.260]   Once an application, but see you've got to get it on the iPhone.
[00:40:41.260 --> 00:40:42.500]   He's posted the source code.
[00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:43.700]   He's given a talk.
[00:40:43.700 --> 00:40:49.020]   He says, you know, you can do this, but this is this is at frankly, this is Apple's argument
[00:40:49.020 --> 00:40:54.700]   for why they're so tight in their application approval process because you're not going
[00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:58.860]   to be able to get spy phone without jailbreaking your iPhone because you can't get it through
[00:40:58.860 --> 00:41:00.620]   the Apple application store.
[00:41:00.620 --> 00:41:02.580]   That's an interesting argument.
[00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:04.820]   Well, that's that Steve Jobs argument.
[00:41:04.820 --> 00:41:06.700]   We want to make a secure phone.
[00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:10.860]   That's why we check every application before we put it on there.
[00:41:10.860 --> 00:41:15.980]   So this, you know, you could say the same thing about computers in general.
[00:41:15.980 --> 00:41:19.540]   I guess we wouldn't have a virus laden environment within the window.
[00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:21.940]   Microsoft wasn't for the fact that everything's open.
[00:41:21.940 --> 00:41:23.380]   Microsoft should have an app store.
[00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:29.220]   And you know, that's actually going of really interesting choice that IBM made back in 1981
[00:41:29.220 --> 00:41:32.260]   when they released a PC.
[00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:33.260]   They didn't hold on to it.
[00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:34.260]   They didn't patent it.
[00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:35.260]   They didn't patent the BIOS.
[00:41:35.260 --> 00:41:37.460]   They allowed people to take it seriously.
[00:41:37.460 --> 00:41:38.460]   Was that why?
[00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:42.260]   Because without that, they were just, you know, kind of there was a guys in Boca Raton that
[00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:44.740]   developed all this stuff in the big boys up north.
[00:41:44.740 --> 00:41:49.900]   They didn't think this, you know, okay, whatever, you know, and, you know, that why should we
[00:41:49.900 --> 00:41:51.780]   didn't want to take it too seriously.
[00:41:51.780 --> 00:41:53.140]   They screwed up.
[00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:54.140]   Should have.
[00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:57.140]   You know, I think that PC's gone places.
[00:41:57.140 --> 00:42:04.500]   AT&T ranked last in Consumer Reports best cell phone service survey, an annual survey of wireless
[00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:05.500]   customer satisfaction.
[00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:08.500]   How do you even know that?
[00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:11.460]   I don't believe in some Verizon app, right?
[00:42:11.460 --> 00:42:12.460]   It can't be true.
[00:42:12.460 --> 00:42:13.460]   It can't be believable.
[00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:18.300]   In a canvas of more than 50,000 readers spanning 26 cities, the carrier that had the
[00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:23.260]   lowest customer satisfaction in 19 cities was AT&T.
[00:42:23.260 --> 00:42:26.660]   Can you guess who number one was the best satisfaction?
[00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:27.660]   Verizon.
[00:42:27.660 --> 00:42:28.660]   Verizon.
[00:42:28.660 --> 00:42:29.660]   Verizon.
[00:42:29.660 --> 00:42:31.140]   Which droid is right?
[00:42:31.140 --> 00:42:32.140]   Droid.
[00:42:32.140 --> 00:42:33.140]   The Apple's.
[00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:35.580]   It's almost enough to get me off the iPhone.
[00:42:35.580 --> 00:42:37.380]   I hate AT&T.
[00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:38.860]   Everybody does.
[00:42:38.860 --> 00:42:42.460]   Apple's iPhones are the top smart phones said Consumer Reports in our ratings among the best
[00:42:42.460 --> 00:42:47.460]   of all phones we tested period, but their exclusive carrier AT&T was middling at best
[00:42:47.460 --> 00:42:49.060]   in satisfaction.
[00:42:49.060 --> 00:42:51.860]   If you are readying, I love how Consumer Reports writes.
[00:42:51.860 --> 00:42:53.940]   There's a certain style.
[00:42:53.940 --> 00:42:58.260]   If you're readying to buy Apple's iPhone, prepare for possible disappointment with its
[00:42:58.260 --> 00:43:01.700]   service and expect to love the phone anyway.
[00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:02.700]   Guaranteed disappointment.
[00:43:02.700 --> 00:43:03.700]   Not poverty.
[00:43:03.700 --> 00:43:04.700]   Guaranteed.
[00:43:04.700 --> 00:43:05.700]   Well put.
[00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:06.700]   It's part of the contract.
[00:43:06.700 --> 00:43:08.260]   It's part of the arrangement you make when you get this phone.
[00:43:08.260 --> 00:43:11.060]   You've been in the game to be disappointed.
[00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:15.740]   And yet it says despite the network problems, a staggering 98% of iPhone users in our survey
[00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:19.780]   were satisfied enough to say they would definitely or probably buy the phone again.
[00:43:19.780 --> 00:43:23.900]   Because they're comparing the phone to what they had before the iPhone.
[00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:28.700]   So what you're saying is that AT&T's ads, which is a
[00:43:28.700 --> 00:43:31.340]   Verizon's ads are a slam AT&T.
[00:43:31.340 --> 00:43:35.940]   I just saw another one where Santa's going out to the barn and all the reindeer in there
[00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:37.420]   and it's cold and he's got his lantern.
[00:43:37.420 --> 00:43:39.580]   He says, "Okay boys, you're ready?"
[00:43:39.580 --> 00:43:41.580]   And they all have maps pop up from their heads.
[00:43:41.580 --> 00:43:42.580]   This makes no sense.
[00:43:42.580 --> 00:43:43.580]   Maps.
[00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:46.700]   They got the Verizon coverage maps coming out of their head.
[00:43:46.700 --> 00:43:52.300]   And then Blitzen for reasons no one understands has AT&T's map coming out of his head.
[00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:54.700]   And Santa says, "Really Blitzen?
[00:43:54.700 --> 00:43:55.700]   Really?"
[00:43:55.700 --> 00:43:57.020]   Or no, he doesn't say that.
[00:43:57.020 --> 00:43:58.020]   But something like that.
[00:43:58.020 --> 00:43:59.020]   Does that really go off?
[00:43:59.020 --> 00:44:00.020]   That's really cool.
[00:44:00.020 --> 00:44:04.740]   That's why Santa's reindeer hot their courses using American 3G coverage maps.
[00:44:04.740 --> 00:44:05.740]   That's how Christmas works.
[00:44:05.740 --> 00:44:07.900]   You know what's weird about that commercial?
[00:44:07.900 --> 00:44:08.900]   What?
[00:44:08.900 --> 00:44:10.740]   I would have thought it would have been Donner.
[00:44:10.740 --> 00:44:11.740]   Yeah.
[00:44:11.740 --> 00:44:13.180]   It was always Donner in the up.
[00:44:13.180 --> 00:44:14.180]   It's a Rudolph.
[00:44:14.180 --> 00:44:15.180]   Rudolph.
[00:44:15.180 --> 00:44:16.180]   Oh no, Rudolph's beloved.
[00:44:16.180 --> 00:44:17.180]   You can't mess with Rudolph.
[00:44:17.180 --> 00:44:18.180]   You can't mess with Rudolph.
[00:44:18.180 --> 00:44:19.660]   Rudolph doesn't even, he has his own stall.
[00:44:19.660 --> 00:44:21.420]   He's not in the stable with the rest of the guys.
[00:44:21.420 --> 00:44:22.780]   The Jews don't even have a map.
[00:44:22.780 --> 00:44:23.980]   They won't ask for directions.
[00:44:23.980 --> 00:44:25.460]   They're just lost in the desert.
[00:44:25.460 --> 00:44:27.100]   There's no Santa coming out.
[00:44:27.100 --> 00:44:28.100]   AT&T.
[00:44:28.100 --> 00:44:29.660]   Donner, not Donner, sorry.
[00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:31.300]   Donner, Blitzen.
[00:44:31.300 --> 00:44:32.300]   Donner.
[00:44:32.300 --> 00:44:33.300]   Donner.
[00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:34.300]   Donner.
[00:44:34.300 --> 00:44:36.300]   This means it's a German word for Fonda.
[00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:38.100]   So how long are we going to be stuck with AT?
[00:44:38.100 --> 00:44:41.060]   Are you still on an iPhone baritone of you left yet?
[00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:42.060]   You almost call it the rock.
[00:44:42.060 --> 00:44:43.060]   I thought that was cute.
[00:44:43.060 --> 00:44:44.060]   No, not.
[00:44:44.060 --> 00:44:45.060]   You can call me the rock.
[00:44:45.060 --> 00:44:46.060]   I did not.
[00:44:46.060 --> 00:44:47.060]   I did not.
[00:44:47.060 --> 00:44:49.060]   You projected that entirely weird.
[00:44:49.060 --> 00:44:52.940]   I don't want to take, ladies and gentlemen, you be the judge.
[00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:53.940]   I heard it.
[00:44:53.940 --> 00:44:54.940]   Not even close.
[00:44:54.940 --> 00:45:00.700]   I referred when AT&T's been bad for a while and I say they're sort of the civil liberties
[00:45:00.700 --> 00:45:05.720]   violating crap network operating billing company that occasionally moonlights as a telecom
[00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:07.180]   service provider.
[00:45:07.180 --> 00:45:11.900]   I reluctantly got this iPhone because the Google Android phone wasn't working out so
[00:45:11.900 --> 00:45:12.900]   well.
[00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:15.180]   I just couldn't handle what I was throwing at it.
[00:45:15.180 --> 00:45:16.420]   I'm enforced.
[00:45:16.420 --> 00:45:18.620]   I'm still pretty happy with the iPhone though.
[00:45:18.620 --> 00:45:21.860]   Part of me hates myself for who I've had to get into.
[00:45:21.860 --> 00:45:23.060]   That's exactly what happens.
[00:45:23.060 --> 00:45:24.060]   Right.
[00:45:24.060 --> 00:45:28.340]   So is there any way, you know, I know Esme Vos, what she does is she uses T-Mobile, like
[00:45:28.340 --> 00:45:32.420]   she buys, she just uses the iPhone on, I don't even think she uses the phone.
[00:45:32.420 --> 00:45:35.780]   She's the iPod touch of her Wi-Fi because she's all about Wi-Fi.
[00:45:35.780 --> 00:45:38.820]   And then she just gets like an all you can eat little really inexpensive plan for some
[00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:40.820]   really old school phone for the phone service.
[00:45:40.820 --> 00:45:41.820]   That's a good idea.
[00:45:41.820 --> 00:45:42.820]   That's a great idea.
[00:45:42.820 --> 00:45:43.820]   And she carries those two together.
[00:45:43.820 --> 00:45:49.020]   As long as you can get Wi-Fi somewhere, you're kind of, you know, I can't get the Skype app
[00:45:49.020 --> 00:45:50.020]   to work well enough.
[00:45:50.020 --> 00:45:51.020]   I would love to go all Wi-Fi.
[00:45:51.020 --> 00:45:53.020]   I use Skype in China over Wi-Fi.
[00:45:53.020 --> 00:45:54.020]   Is it all right?
[00:45:54.020 --> 00:45:57.980]   If a Wi-Fi in a hotel was so good, I was able to Skype home for free from my iPhone.
[00:45:57.980 --> 00:45:58.980]   It was awesome.
[00:45:58.980 --> 00:45:59.980]   It was amazing.
[00:45:59.980 --> 00:46:03.540]   But then I mean, the Wi-Fi, I mean, that works if you're in an environment where you
[00:46:03.540 --> 00:46:08.020]   don't move very much or you don't mind going back to a pay phone model where you're looking
[00:46:08.020 --> 00:46:10.300]   for these occasional spots to connect to the mall.
[00:46:10.300 --> 00:46:11.300]   Right.
[00:46:11.300 --> 00:46:15.900]   And like a phone phone and this other phone, that sort of defeated the purpose of an integrated
[00:46:15.900 --> 00:46:16.900]   device for me.
[00:46:16.900 --> 00:46:19.780]   And I'm not trying to switch to Verizon now for the joy.
[00:46:19.780 --> 00:46:22.020]   It's just, I'm done for a while.
[00:46:22.020 --> 00:46:26.260]   It's kind of ironic because in China, they block Twitter friend feed flicker.
[00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:28.140]   But you can use Skype.
[00:46:28.140 --> 00:46:30.540]   Here you can't use Skype, but Twitter and friend feed all the way.
[00:46:30.540 --> 00:46:33.740]   That's more communist to use Skype apparently in her Wi-Fi.
[00:46:33.740 --> 00:46:34.740]   That's right.
[00:46:34.740 --> 00:46:37.140]   So they don't like AT&T either apparently in Beijing.
[00:46:37.140 --> 00:46:42.380]   AT&T's response to the Consumer Reports findings, quote, "Leoprene."
[00:46:42.380 --> 00:46:44.180]   Do they sue them?
[00:46:44.180 --> 00:46:45.620]   You suck or so?
[00:46:45.620 --> 00:46:49.340]   No, they're going to sue every consumer who reported on their back.
[00:46:49.340 --> 00:46:53.060]   We want the, they subpoenaed the surveys and they'll be calling you.
[00:46:53.060 --> 00:46:56.500]   We appreciate and value all customer feedback.
[00:46:56.500 --> 00:47:00.420]   We learn from it and it helps us serve our customers better.
[00:47:00.420 --> 00:47:06.820]   Without question, the surest indication of customer satisfaction is churn or turnover.
[00:47:06.820 --> 00:47:13.540]   With the last quarter, our post-paid churn, wow, was just 1.17%.
[00:47:13.540 --> 00:47:18.860]   That means only, that means 99% of iPhone users stuck with it.
[00:47:18.860 --> 00:47:23.660]   What they, what they don't mention is that they're probably their contract exit fees
[00:47:23.660 --> 00:47:27.260]   prevents a lot of wood churn from doing so.
[00:47:27.260 --> 00:47:31.620]   It might help that it costs $175 to churn.
[00:47:31.620 --> 00:47:34.580]   And the way they tier their pricing is so freaking irritating.
[00:47:34.580 --> 00:47:39.140]   It's like we give you all these, you know, I should never drink before it.
[00:47:39.140 --> 00:47:42.340]   I never drink before you stand up and I tried today.
[00:47:42.340 --> 00:47:43.340]   Have a cookie.
[00:47:43.340 --> 00:47:44.780]   Yeah, I'll have a cookie.
[00:47:44.780 --> 00:47:50.220]   We have actually a broad variety of beverages set aside for you, the Sarasilver Minute Lesbians.
[00:47:50.220 --> 00:47:51.220]   I can't believe you.
[00:47:51.220 --> 00:47:54.860]   We've got Takati, we've got vodka, we've got two kinds.
[00:47:54.860 --> 00:47:58.420]   Dan Acroids, Daniel Acroids, Crystal Head Vodka, isn't that gorgeous?
[00:47:58.420 --> 00:47:59.420]   Autographed.
[00:47:59.420 --> 00:48:00.420]   It's actual size.
[00:48:00.420 --> 00:48:01.420]   That's how big his head is.
[00:48:01.420 --> 00:48:05.540]   No, but just, I hate that they give you this pricing so that they try to make it sound
[00:48:05.540 --> 00:48:06.740]   like they're giving roll over minutes.
[00:48:06.740 --> 00:48:10.580]   We're giving it, you can't even use them because you're forced to buy an enormous package
[00:48:10.580 --> 00:48:11.580]   you'll never use.
[00:48:11.580 --> 00:48:13.100]   I can't believe I just said that.
[00:48:13.100 --> 00:48:14.100]   Strike it rich.
[00:48:14.100 --> 00:48:15.100]   Strike it rich.
[00:48:15.100 --> 00:48:17.940]   It's just said something, enormous package you'll never use.
[00:48:17.940 --> 00:48:20.140]   I heard it.
[00:48:20.140 --> 00:48:22.380]   Wonder what she meant by that.
[00:48:22.380 --> 00:48:23.380]   Strike it rich.
[00:48:23.380 --> 00:48:29.140]   In the chat room pointed out that if as soon as AT&T loses its exclusivity on the iPhone,
[00:48:29.140 --> 00:48:32.700]   he said then watch the churn and he's actually right.
[00:48:32.700 --> 00:48:37.620]   We've gotten to this point, churn used to be a lot higher in this country when no cell
[00:48:37.620 --> 00:48:41.380]   phone service was still relatively new and people were shopping for deals and there's
[00:48:41.380 --> 00:48:43.740]   massive difference in plans.
[00:48:43.740 --> 00:48:45.580]   We've gotten pretty mature at this point.
[00:48:45.580 --> 00:48:49.980]   People are locked into family plans, they're locked into certain operating systems or devices.
[00:48:49.980 --> 00:48:54.420]   So I think overall industry churn is a bit lower.
[00:48:54.420 --> 00:48:58.260]   I would be curious about it if Verizon's churn is lower than AT&T's.
[00:48:58.260 --> 00:49:01.140]   I doubt that AT&T revealed that in their response.
[00:49:01.140 --> 00:49:05.140]   I know, but I bet Verizon's churn is pretty good.
[00:49:05.140 --> 00:49:06.300]   I'm very happy with the draw.
[00:49:06.300 --> 00:49:09.620]   Well, I have to say I had Verizon first and I had horrible and correct billing from that.
[00:49:09.620 --> 00:49:11.460]   That's just my own experience for a long time.
[00:49:11.460 --> 00:49:13.220]   And I had much better experience with T-Mobile.
[00:49:13.220 --> 00:49:14.220]   Well, let's face it.
[00:49:14.220 --> 00:49:16.740]   You know, T-Mobile does have good customer service but let's face it.
[00:49:16.740 --> 00:49:18.340]   All cell phone companies suck.
[00:49:18.340 --> 00:49:19.340]   They're all awful.
[00:49:19.340 --> 00:49:22.140]   Can we just get some of their geek around?
[00:49:22.140 --> 00:49:24.140]   I just want to say that's the track phone on the first night.
[00:49:24.140 --> 00:49:25.140]   They do good job.
[00:49:25.140 --> 00:49:26.140]   What kind of phone?
[00:49:26.140 --> 00:49:27.140]   John McBarter's.
[00:49:27.140 --> 00:49:28.140]   It's a breakfast phone.
[00:49:28.140 --> 00:49:32.100]   You call them up, you get a couple of minutes, so you use the phone and you throw in the
[00:49:32.100 --> 00:49:33.100]   garbage.
[00:49:33.100 --> 00:49:34.100]   Fantastic.
[00:49:34.100 --> 00:49:35.460]   The choice of dealers everywhere.
[00:49:35.460 --> 00:49:36.460]   Track phone.
[00:49:36.460 --> 00:49:37.460]   You'll...
[00:49:37.460 --> 00:49:38.460]   Track phone.
[00:49:38.460 --> 00:49:41.980]   By the way, here's a story that's piqued my interest.
[00:49:41.980 --> 00:49:43.140]   Google Schmidt.
[00:49:43.140 --> 00:49:44.140]   Schmidt.
[00:49:44.140 --> 00:49:48.580]   Fratinated newspaper execs just looking for someone to blame.
[00:49:48.580 --> 00:49:50.300]   Yeah, this is what it's got my interest too.
[00:49:50.300 --> 00:49:52.900]   I thought we talked more about it this week in Google.
[00:49:52.900 --> 00:49:56.980]   Did you read Keras decoding of Eric Schmidt's Wall Street Journal piece?
[00:49:56.980 --> 00:49:57.980]   It's pretty funny.
[00:49:57.980 --> 00:49:58.980]   On all things D.
[00:49:58.980 --> 00:49:59.980]   Keras, Swiss, Schwisher.
[00:49:59.980 --> 00:50:00.980]   Yeah.
[00:50:00.980 --> 00:50:02.980]   You're the one drinking and I can't say Keras, Swisher.
[00:50:02.980 --> 00:50:03.980]   Keras, Swisher.
[00:50:03.980 --> 00:50:05.660]   Keras, Swisher and all things D, man.
[00:50:05.660 --> 00:50:09.060]   Yeah, it's like the big story for a change of the week in the media business that the
[00:50:09.060 --> 00:50:13.020]   newspaper publishers and the traditional publishers are freaked out and, you know, we're
[00:50:13.020 --> 00:50:16.500]   not saying they're going to try to de-index from Google.
[00:50:16.500 --> 00:50:17.500]   Everything in his empire.
[00:50:17.500 --> 00:50:18.500]   You're a joke.
[00:50:18.500 --> 00:50:20.140]   It's a complete joke.
[00:50:20.140 --> 00:50:21.540]   They're not going to benefit.
[00:50:21.540 --> 00:50:22.540]   And it just happened.
[00:50:22.540 --> 00:50:26.140]   Although Jeff, Jeff has explained that the first click story was not a response to this.
[00:50:26.140 --> 00:50:27.140]   Let's talk about the first click thing.
[00:50:27.140 --> 00:50:28.140]   Because I think that's got to Google is changing.
[00:50:28.140 --> 00:50:30.460]   Trying to bring it back guys to the tech.
[00:50:30.460 --> 00:50:31.660]   I just want everyone in our seat.
[00:50:31.660 --> 00:50:32.660]   Thank you.
[00:50:32.660 --> 00:50:33.660]   I'm trying to geek it up for you.

[00:52:57.780 --> 00:52:59.780]   You can go to the girl in the two.
[00:52:59.780 --> 00:53:01.780]   You can go to the girl in the two.

[00:53:33.780 --> 00:53:35.780]   You can go to the girl in the two.
[00:53:35.780 --> 00:53:37.780]   You can go to the girl in the two.
[00:53:37.780 --> 00:53:39.780]   You can go to the girl in the two.
[00:53:39.780 --> 00:53:41.780]   You can go to the girl in the two.
[00:53:41.780 --> 00:53:43.780]   You can go to the girl in the two.
[00:53:43.780 --> 00:53:45.780]   You can go to the girl in the two.
[00:53:45.780 --> 00:53:47.780]   You can go to the girl in the two.
[00:53:47.780 --> 00:53:49.780]   You can go to the girl in the two.
[00:53:49.780 --> 00:53:51.780]   You can go to the girl in the two.
[00:53:51.780 --> 00:53:53.780]   You can go to the girl in the two.
[00:53:53.780 --> 00:53:55.780]   You can go to the girl in the two.
[00:53:55.780 --> 00:53:57.780]   You can go to the girl in the two.
[00:53:57.780 --> 00:53:59.780]   You can go to the girl in the two.
[00:53:59.780 --> 00:54:01.780]   You can go to the girl in the two.
[00:54:01.780 --> 00:54:03.780]   You can go to the girl in the two.
[00:54:03.780 --> 00:54:05.780]   You can go to the girl in the two.
[00:54:05.780 --> 00:54:07.780]   You can go to the girl in the two.
[00:54:07.780 --> 00:54:09.780]   You can go to the girl in the two.
[00:54:09.780 --> 00:54:11.780]   You can go to the girl in the two.
[00:54:11.780 --> 00:54:13.780]   You can go to the girl in the two.
[00:54:13.780 --> 00:54:15.780]   You can go to the girl in the two.
[00:54:15.780 --> 00:54:17.780]   You can go to the girl in the two.
[00:54:17.780 --> 00:54:19.780]   You can go to the girl in the two.
[00:54:19.780 --> 00:54:21.780]   It's a classic Hollywood approach.
[00:54:21.780 --> 00:54:23.780]   That makes sense.
[00:54:23.780 --> 00:54:25.780]   Maybe you're just a language of theft.
[00:54:25.780 --> 00:54:27.780]   It's a lot of hype, but I do think he would like to see wider models.
[00:54:27.780 --> 00:54:31.780]   I think you hit it on the nail net, but it's always so entertaining.
[00:54:31.780 --> 00:54:33.780]   Having worked in the entertainment business,
[00:54:33.780 --> 00:54:35.780]   just the psychology of that business is so much about special relationships.
[00:54:35.780 --> 00:54:37.780]   But it only works.
[00:54:37.780 --> 00:54:39.780]   That's a special relationship.
[00:54:39.780 --> 00:54:41.780]   If you're in the club, if you're outside the club,
[00:54:41.780 --> 00:54:43.780]   there's no incentive generally unless you think there's something wrong with you.
[00:54:43.780 --> 00:54:45.780]   And the tech business is not nearly as club oriented.
[00:54:45.780 --> 00:54:47.780]   No.
[00:54:47.780 --> 00:54:49.780]   And the dynamics work differently.
[00:54:49.780 --> 00:54:51.780]   I just saw Peter Goobert, supernova,
[00:54:51.780 --> 00:54:53.780]   give his whole talk the other day.
[00:54:53.780 --> 00:54:57.780]   And all of his assumptions about business were completely 180 degrees from everyone else in the room.
[00:54:57.780 --> 00:55:01.780]   And yet he couldn't pick up on the fact that the kind of dollars also he's talking about
[00:55:01.780 --> 00:55:05.780]   are actually small compared to the kind of dollars people in the tech business are working.
[00:55:05.780 --> 00:55:09.780]   So I think it's a big psychological shift that they just haven't made because they think
[00:55:09.780 --> 00:55:11.780]   you'll think the way I think they're not going to see themselves well enough.
[00:55:11.780 --> 00:55:13.780]   We were all special, right?
[00:55:13.780 --> 00:55:17.780]   Because here we are at Sun Valley, aren't we important being special together?
[00:55:17.780 --> 00:55:21.780]   I know like they basically are not, I mean, those guys have William,
[00:55:21.780 --> 00:55:24.780]   I mean, whatever, Twitter's new, but they don't really get the tech guys.
[00:55:24.780 --> 00:55:29.780]   They don't think they make sense and they're trying to get to still play the special deal game.
[00:55:29.780 --> 00:55:31.780]   And the tech guys couldn't care less about that.
[00:55:31.780 --> 00:55:32.780]   That's the thing.
[00:55:32.780 --> 00:55:37.780]   It's like the free out of people from the nerd table is that you learn to opt out early and you don't care.
[00:55:37.780 --> 00:55:39.780]   And then the special deal game doesn't apply to you.
[00:55:39.780 --> 00:55:43.780]   And that's true whether it's in high school or it's a $10 billion business.
[00:55:43.780 --> 00:55:47.780]   I mean, why, what incentive does Google have to do a special deal with Murdoch?
[00:55:47.780 --> 00:55:48.780]   None.
[00:55:48.780 --> 00:55:49.780]   They don't need to.
[00:55:49.780 --> 00:55:50.780]   There's no dollar in so different.
[00:55:50.780 --> 00:55:51.780]   So this play is...
[00:55:51.780 --> 00:55:54.780]   I was going to make a comment on Heather's long diatribe there.
[00:55:54.780 --> 00:55:57.780]   One too many conferences.
[00:55:57.780 --> 00:55:59.780]   Supernova.
[00:55:59.780 --> 00:56:04.780]   Hey, you know, I was a paid performer there, John.
[00:56:04.780 --> 00:56:06.780]   So I listened before I...
[00:56:06.780 --> 00:56:07.780]   She's getting money for this.
[00:56:07.780 --> 00:56:08.780]   So there you go.
[00:56:08.780 --> 00:56:10.780]   No, that's the way to do it.
[00:56:10.780 --> 00:56:12.780]   I'll go to conferences if they'll pay me.
[00:56:12.780 --> 00:56:14.780]   Isn't that what Rupert Murdoch's really saying?
[00:56:14.780 --> 00:56:15.780]   It's right.
[00:56:15.780 --> 00:56:16.780]   Really?
[00:56:16.780 --> 00:56:17.780]   Give me some money.
[00:56:17.780 --> 00:56:18.780]   Give me some money.
[00:56:18.780 --> 00:56:26.780]   I mean, I think it's really, but you're saying, but I don't see how it's going to work because I think he's operating on assumptions don't apply to the people he's trying to negotiate with.
[00:56:26.780 --> 00:56:27.780]   I think you're absolutely right on.
[00:56:27.780 --> 00:56:28.780]   That's very interesting.
[00:56:28.780 --> 00:56:29.780]   It's a culture gap.
[00:56:29.780 --> 00:56:30.780]   I think so.
[00:56:30.780 --> 00:56:31.780]   Yeah.
[00:56:31.780 --> 00:56:32.780]   And a generation gap.
[00:56:32.780 --> 00:56:37.780]   Because he thinks because Microsoft, who's desperate enough and they're the player in the game right with Bing that hasn't been mentioned yet, they...
[00:56:37.780 --> 00:56:39.780]   Off they did this with music too.
[00:56:39.780 --> 00:56:44.780]   They try to line up everyone in LA and say, "Well, we'll pay you for you to use our technology."
[00:56:44.780 --> 00:56:49.780]   So for now you're going to get one cash payment for Microsoft while this system works for a little while.
[00:56:49.780 --> 00:56:51.780]   Happened with Windows Media Player 2.
[00:56:51.780 --> 00:56:53.780]   So it's not the deal with Bing.
[00:56:53.780 --> 00:56:55.780]   We want to get paid by Microsoft.
[00:56:55.780 --> 00:56:56.780]   They want Bing to matter.
[00:56:56.780 --> 00:56:57.780]   They're going to pay us all.
[00:56:57.780 --> 00:57:01.780]   But part of the deal with Microsoft is we've got to get out of the competitor.
[00:57:01.780 --> 00:57:04.780]   That's what happened when I was at Apple and we dealt with everybody in the music business.
[00:57:04.780 --> 00:57:06.780]   They wanted to push away quick time.
[00:57:06.780 --> 00:57:09.780]   So they could go to Windows Media Player.
[00:57:09.780 --> 00:57:14.780]   But it didn't matter in the long run because quick time was already out there and broad enough that it just surpassed it anyway.
[00:57:14.780 --> 00:57:17.780]   Not to mention at that point, real player and whatever else was going on.
[00:57:17.780 --> 00:57:19.780]   So I don't know.
[00:57:19.780 --> 00:57:22.780]   That's my guess is we can get a payment this week for Microsoft.
[00:57:22.780 --> 00:57:24.780]   But I don't see Microsoft paying them for a decade.
[00:57:24.780 --> 00:57:27.780]   Get it while you can because it's not going to last.
[00:57:27.780 --> 00:57:28.780]   We're going to take a break.
[00:57:28.780 --> 00:57:29.780]   Hold on.
[00:57:29.780 --> 00:57:30.780]   Hold on.
[00:57:30.780 --> 00:57:32.780]   What do you want to talk about and then we'll tease it.
[00:57:32.780 --> 00:57:33.780]   How about that?
[00:57:33.780 --> 00:57:34.780]   Crunch.
[00:57:34.780 --> 00:57:35.780]   No, I said that we talked about the Crunchpad.
[00:57:35.780 --> 00:57:36.780]   It didn't.
[00:57:36.780 --> 00:57:39.780]   And this is the most dramatic wonderful story which we'll get to in just a moment.
[00:57:39.780 --> 00:57:40.780]   Well, for you.
[00:57:40.780 --> 00:57:41.780]   No, I'm not at.
[00:57:41.780 --> 00:57:42.780]   Are you Crunchpad?
[00:57:42.780 --> 00:57:43.780]   I'm a real real real.
[00:57:43.780 --> 00:57:45.780]   I love Mike Harrington.
[00:57:45.780 --> 00:57:46.780]   I have nothing against him.
[00:57:46.780 --> 00:57:51.780]   I'm just curious what you guys think about this very strange story.
[00:57:51.780 --> 00:57:52.780]   And I mean weird.
[00:57:52.780 --> 00:57:58.780]   But before we do that, I do want to mention our friends and Citrix and the folks who do go to my PC.
[00:57:58.780 --> 00:58:00.780]   This is remote access done right.
[00:58:00.780 --> 00:58:02.780]   I haven't talked about going to my PC in a while.
[00:58:02.780 --> 00:58:04.780]   And I hope you've heard me talk about it.
[00:58:04.780 --> 00:58:06.780]   And if you haven't tried it, I hope you will try it.
[00:58:06.780 --> 00:58:07.780]   Go to my PC.
[00:58:07.780 --> 00:58:09.780]   It's very easy to install.
[00:58:09.780 --> 00:58:11.780]   And most remote access programs, it's complicated.
[00:58:11.780 --> 00:58:14.780]   You've got to figure out what operating system you've got to figure out.
[00:58:14.780 --> 00:58:20.780]   If you've got what it needs, you've got to often DMZ your computer or open port forwarding
[00:58:20.780 --> 00:58:22.780]   and your router.
[00:58:22.780 --> 00:58:23.780]   This is so much easier.
[00:58:23.780 --> 00:58:25.780]   Go to my PC.
[00:58:25.780 --> 00:58:26.780]   It just couldn't be simpler.
[00:58:26.780 --> 00:58:31.780]   All you've got to do is go to the website, G-O-T-O-M-Y-P-C.com right now.
[00:58:31.780 --> 00:58:34.780]   You actually go to my PC.com/twit so we get credit for it.
[00:58:34.780 --> 00:58:37.780]   Go to my PC.com/twit.
[00:58:37.780 --> 00:58:40.780]   And within two minutes you'll have it installed.
[00:58:40.780 --> 00:58:42.780]   No configuration, nothing more.
[00:58:42.780 --> 00:58:44.780]   And by the way, secure.
[00:58:44.780 --> 00:58:49.780]   If you've been worried about the idea and a lot of these remote access products do have security issues.
[00:58:49.780 --> 00:58:52.780]   Maybe this is like a VPN.
[00:58:52.780 --> 00:58:54.780]   This is like 128-bit SSL encryption.
[00:58:54.780 --> 00:59:00.780]   So if you're at an internet cafe or somewhere you want to get to your office computer and surf
[00:59:00.780 --> 00:59:02.780]   and get some files, you don't have to worry.
[00:59:02.780 --> 00:59:05.780]   It's absolutely secure end-to-end encryption.
[00:59:05.780 --> 00:59:08.780]   Easy to set up takes two minutes.
[00:59:08.780 --> 00:59:12.780]   PC World gave it their world class award for best remote access software.
[00:59:12.780 --> 00:59:14.780]   And they've done that year after year after year.
[00:59:14.780 --> 00:59:16.780]   It's just the best.
[00:59:16.780 --> 00:59:17.780]   So go there right now.
[00:59:17.780 --> 00:59:18.780]   Go to my PC.com/twit.
[00:59:18.780 --> 00:59:19.780]   Install it.
[00:59:19.780 --> 00:59:20.780]   Have it ready on your system.
[00:59:20.780 --> 00:59:21.780]   Now you've got some travels coming up.
[00:59:21.780 --> 00:59:25.780]   You're going over the river and through the woods to grandmother's house for the holidays.
[00:59:25.780 --> 00:59:26.780]   You want to get out of town.
[00:59:26.780 --> 00:59:30.780]   Or maybe you just want to spend some time away from the office at home with a family.
[00:59:30.780 --> 00:59:34.780]   All you have to do, anytime you need to access the office computer, is you go to go to my PC.com.
[00:59:34.780 --> 00:59:36.780]   You log in with your secure username and password.
[00:59:36.780 --> 00:59:40.780]   You've got a 128-bit encrypted pipeline to your PC.
[00:59:40.780 --> 00:59:44.780]   You see it on your screen just like you're there.
[00:59:44.780 --> 00:59:45.780]   The menus are all there.
[00:59:45.780 --> 00:59:46.780]   All the applications.
[00:59:46.780 --> 00:59:47.780]   You can send and receive email.
[00:59:47.780 --> 00:59:48.780]   Anything you want to do.
[00:59:48.780 --> 00:59:49.780]   Just like you're there.
[00:59:49.780 --> 00:59:51.780]   Try it free for the next 30 days.
[00:59:51.780 --> 00:59:52.780]   Unlimited use.
[00:59:52.780 --> 00:59:55.780]   When they first started doing the ads, they said, "We'll give you an hour a month."
[00:59:55.780 --> 00:59:56.780]   They said, "No, no, no, no.
[00:59:56.780 --> 00:59:58.780]   I want 30 days 24/7."
[00:59:58.780 --> 01:00:00.780]   That's what they gave you.
[01:00:00.780 --> 01:00:05.780]   30 days 24/7 uses as much as you want now through the new year.
[01:00:05.780 --> 01:00:07.780]   Go to my PC.com/twit.
[01:00:07.780 --> 01:00:10.780]   Thank you so much for their support this weekend tech.
[01:00:10.780 --> 01:00:13.780]   John, you want to summarize the Crunchpad story?
[01:00:13.780 --> 01:00:15.780]   It's a bizarre story.
[01:00:15.780 --> 01:00:20.780]   First of all, about a year ago, Mike Arrington at TechCrunch announced that they were going
[01:00:20.780 --> 01:00:25.220]   to be a great fan of the
[01:00:25.220 --> 01:00:26.780]   company.
[01:00:26.780 --> 01:00:28.780]   I think this is really admirable.
[01:00:28.780 --> 01:00:34.780]   Create a tablet, open source, use Linux, work with people in the industry, and make a pad, make a tablet.
[01:00:34.780 --> 01:00:35.780]   Was it a good idea?
[01:00:35.780 --> 01:00:36.780]   Was it a bad idea?
[01:00:36.780 --> 01:00:37.780]   John, what was it?
[01:00:37.780 --> 01:00:39.780]   What is your reaction when you heard about the Crunchpad?
[01:00:39.780 --> 01:00:42.780]   I thought the whole thing, well, looking at the in hindsight now, I'm thinking the whole thing
[01:00:42.780 --> 01:00:46.780]   may just have been one giant publicity stunt.
[01:00:46.780 --> 01:00:51.780]   He got...
[01:00:51.780 --> 01:01:02.780]   This never happens, but it seems as though he got his Washington Post article and he probably increased his circulation by 10-20%, at least for the short term.
[01:01:02.780 --> 01:01:03.780]   So what happened?
[01:01:03.780 --> 01:01:11.780]   Earlier in the story, the way he tells the story, it's on his blog, he says these Indian partners that he worked with,
[01:01:11.780 --> 01:01:16.780]   decided to essentially drop him out of the equation and go off and do it themselves.
[01:01:16.780 --> 01:01:19.780]   Two days before the public debut.
[01:01:19.780 --> 01:01:20.780]   Mm-hmm.
[01:01:20.780 --> 01:01:23.780]   Is this make any sense to anybody?
[01:01:23.780 --> 01:01:27.780]   Well, here's a couple of problems that come up right away.
[01:01:27.780 --> 01:01:29.780]   How do they even think they could do this?
[01:01:29.780 --> 01:01:30.780]   It's called the Crunchpad.
[01:01:30.780 --> 01:01:31.780]   He owns the rights to that.
[01:01:31.780 --> 01:01:32.780]   He owns the design.
[01:01:32.780 --> 01:01:39.780]   He said even on his blog post, is as if Foxconn two days before the iPhone comes out, says, "Apple, we're going to sell it ourselves.
[01:01:39.780 --> 01:01:40.780]   Thanks, though.
[01:01:40.780 --> 01:01:41.780]   We really appreciate the help."
[01:01:41.780 --> 01:01:44.780]   Well, if he's going to do the whole thing, open source, he's got no patents.
[01:01:44.780 --> 01:01:48.780]   He has trademarks, obviously, because Crunchpad would be his trademark.
[01:01:48.780 --> 01:01:50.780]   I'm sure he did that much.
[01:01:50.780 --> 01:01:53.780]   But there's zero patents in the whole thing, just kind of open source.
[01:01:53.780 --> 01:01:59.780]   There really is no reason to keep him around as a partner, unless they have some written agreement that these guys...
[01:01:59.780 --> 01:02:04.780]   You know, I mean, you have to write these contracts with these vendors in an ironclad fashion.
[01:02:04.780 --> 01:02:05.780]   But Mike is a lawyer.
[01:02:05.780 --> 01:02:07.780]   I mean, Mike knows what he's doing.
[01:02:07.780 --> 01:02:09.780]   Why is Mike developing products?
[01:02:09.780 --> 01:02:10.780]   Why not?
[01:02:10.780 --> 01:02:13.780]   That's what makes me think it's a publicity stunt, by the way.
[01:02:13.780 --> 01:02:15.780]   That question you just asked.
[01:02:15.780 --> 01:02:22.780]   The way I see it is, you know, he probably did this because it was fun, because you can.
[01:02:22.780 --> 01:02:28.780]   And the cautionary tale for me is one that's probably universal, which is always be careful of who you do business with.
[01:02:28.780 --> 01:02:30.780]   You can't anticipate everything ahead of time.
[01:02:30.780 --> 01:02:38.780]   But also, it seems a lot of this was so dependent on our super globalized, like just in time, supply chain,
[01:02:38.780 --> 01:02:43.780]   outsourced partners, within outsourced partners, within outsourced subcontractors world.
[01:02:43.780 --> 01:02:51.780]   And part of the price to pay is you don't know the feeling that you could get such aggressive pricing and favorable terms.
[01:02:51.780 --> 01:02:59.780]   Maybe part of the price of that is, you know, the uncertainty that these people will actually honor the agreements you think you've entered into with them.
[01:02:59.780 --> 01:03:03.780]   I don't know, obviously no one knows everything except the parties involved.
[01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:07.780]   But based on reading all those posts on a site, I just kept thinking like, wow, like this seems so important.
[01:03:07.780 --> 01:03:08.780]   It seems so easy.
[01:03:08.780 --> 01:03:10.780]   Maybe it was too easy.
[01:03:10.780 --> 01:03:19.780]   Charles Arthur writing in the "A Guardian" points out that nobody outside of TechCrunch really seems to have laid hands on a Crunchpad.
[01:03:19.780 --> 01:03:23.780]   So maybe this thing is complete like a publicity stunt, tell us.
[01:03:23.780 --> 01:03:25.780]   It's like J.T. LeRoy of Tech.
[01:03:25.780 --> 01:03:27.780]   Who's J.T. LeRoy?
[01:03:27.780 --> 01:03:28.780]   He's not a reference.
[01:03:28.780 --> 01:03:29.780]   It's going to read this crap.
[01:03:29.780 --> 01:03:32.780]   J.T. LeRoy was a literary figure.
[01:03:32.780 --> 01:03:37.780]   There's your problem right there.
[01:03:37.780 --> 01:03:44.780]   I'm not sure.
[01:03:44.780 --> 01:03:51.780]   I'm not sure.
[01:03:51.780 --> 01:03:56.780]   I'm not sure.
[01:03:56.780 --> 01:04:03.780]   I'm not sure.
[01:04:03.780 --> 01:04:10.780]   I'm not sure.
[01:04:10.780 --> 01:04:15.780]   I'm not sure.
[01:04:15.780 --> 01:04:25.780]   I'm not sure.
[01:04:25.780 --> 01:04:30.780]   I'm not sure.
[01:04:30.780 --> 01:04:35.780]   I'm not sure.
[01:04:35.780 --> 01:04:45.780]   I'm not sure.
[01:04:45.780 --> 01:04:50.780]   I'm not sure.
[01:04:50.780 --> 01:04:55.780]   I'm not sure.
[01:04:55.780 --> 01:05:16.780]   I'm not sure.
[01:05:16.780 --> 01:05:33.780]   I'm not sure.
[01:05:33.780 --> 01:05:47.780]   I'm not sure.
[01:05:47.780 --> 01:05:52.780]   I'm not sure.
[01:05:52.780 --> 01:06:07.780]   I'm not sure.
[01:06:07.780 --> 01:06:22.780]   I'm not sure.
[01:06:22.780 --> 01:06:27.780]   I'm not sure.
[01:06:27.780 --> 01:06:32.780]   I'm not sure.
[01:06:32.780 --> 01:06:47.780]   I'm not sure.
[01:06:47.780 --> 01:06:52.780]   I'm not sure.
[01:06:52.780 --> 01:06:57.780]   I'm not sure.
[01:06:57.780 --> 01:07:12.780]   I'm not sure.
[01:07:12.780 --> 01:07:17.780]   I'm not sure.
[01:07:17.780 --> 01:07:22.780]   I'm not sure.
[01:07:22.780 --> 01:07:42.780]   I'm not sure.
[01:07:42.780 --> 01:07:47.780]   I'm not sure.
[01:07:47.780 --> 01:08:07.780]   I'm not sure.
[01:08:07.780 --> 01:08:27.780]   I'm not sure.
[01:08:27.780 --> 01:08:47.780]   I'm not sure.
[01:08:47.780 --> 01:08:53.780]   I'm not sure.
[01:08:53.780 --> 01:09:13.780]   I'm not sure.
[01:09:13.780 --> 01:09:18.780]   I'm not sure.
[01:09:18.780 --> 01:09:38.780]   I'm not sure.
[01:09:38.780 --> 01:09:44.780]   I'm not sure.
[01:09:44.780 --> 01:10:04.780]   I'm not sure.
[01:10:04.780 --> 01:10:10.780]   I'm not sure.
[01:10:10.780 --> 01:10:30.780]   I'm not sure.
[01:10:30.780 --> 01:10:36.780]   I'm not sure.
[01:10:36.780 --> 01:10:56.780]   I'm not sure.
[01:10:56.780 --> 01:11:00.780]   I'm not sure.
[01:11:00.780 --> 01:11:20.780]   I'm not sure.
[01:11:20.780 --> 01:11:26.780]   I'm not sure.
[01:11:26.780 --> 01:11:46.780]   I'm not sure.
[01:11:46.780 --> 01:11:50.780]   I'm not sure.
[01:11:50.780 --> 01:12:10.780]   I'm not sure.
[01:12:10.780 --> 01:12:14.780]   I'm not sure.
[01:12:14.780 --> 01:12:34.780]   I'm not sure.
[01:12:34.780 --> 01:12:38.780]   I'm not sure.
[01:12:38.780 --> 01:12:58.780]   I'm not sure.
[01:12:58.780 --> 01:13:02.780]   I'm not sure.
[01:13:02.780 --> 01:13:22.780]   I'm not sure.
[01:13:22.780 --> 01:13:26.780]   I'm not sure.
[01:13:26.780 --> 01:13:46.780]   I'm not sure.
[01:13:46.780 --> 01:13:50.780]   I'm not sure.
[01:13:50.780 --> 01:14:10.780]   I'm not sure.
[01:14:10.780 --> 01:14:30.780]   I'm not sure.
[01:14:30.780 --> 01:14:34.780]   I'm not sure.
[01:14:34.780 --> 01:14:54.780]   I'm not sure.
[01:14:54.780 --> 01:14:58.780]   I'm not sure.
[01:14:58.780 --> 01:15:18.780]   I'm not sure.
[01:15:18.780 --> 01:15:38.780]   I'm not sure.
