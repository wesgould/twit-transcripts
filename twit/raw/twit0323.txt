[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   It's time for TWiT This Week in Tech.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   And ladies and gentlemen, we are gathered here to discuss more than just the iPhone 4S.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   I can promise you that.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   But first, let's say hello to Mr. John C. DeVorek.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   Welcome back Mr. D. Hello.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   Good to have you. Good to be here as usual.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   No agenda fame.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   You know I found some old silicon spin shows.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   Oh did you now? Yes.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   Because I have most of those.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   I know you've told me that but they're on like VHS.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   Oh those are probably some dubs.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   No that's what I'm saying I thought you had them on VHS.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   No no I have the ones on digital.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   Oh you have DAT. Yeah.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   Oh alright. Or whatever.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   No it was C or it was VHSC.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   Yeah so I'm like no it was a digital C or D or something. I don't know it was you know who knows.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   Well I found a BitTorrent that had a lot of old screensaver stuff and there's a silicon spin effect.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   I'm going to see if I can find it before the end of the show and we can watch John C. in his heyday.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   I was probably complaining.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   You probably were bitching and moaning.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   Also here we know because we watched him drive here on Glimpse, Robert Scoble.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   Oh that's Scobleizer. Good to have you Robert.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   Thanks for having me on.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   And also via Skype in our avatar today Mr. Om Malik of GigaOm.com. Welcome Om. Always great to have you.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   Great to be here.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   Om is the digital wizard.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   If you say so.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   Yeah. Did you get an iPhone 4S Om or did you?
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   I did. I just walked into the store and just bought it all just like any other regular consumer.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   How dare you?
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   Yeah I know.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   He's not a waiting liner.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   He was waiting in line.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   Yeah overnight.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   Yeah. He likes to, I think he obviously doesn't have to, but he likes to do that to hang out.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   Did you get one too Robert? No you're still on the 4.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   Verizon screwed me.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   What happened?
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   They cancelled my order like a day before.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   Oh that's frustrating.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   And so my son has his.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   And John of course you're still using a burner.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   No I'm using a scratch proof Android.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   Yeah you're using an Android there.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   This thing here I mean.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   That's the Galaxy. I love the Galaxy.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   I keep it with my keys and there's no scratches. It's not all crappy looking like the iPhone.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   It's an amazing thing.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   What are you talking about?
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   So Om what do you, first of all interesting.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Sales of the iPhone 4S despite the fact that it in many ways is not a particularly huge upgrade to the iPhone 4 were huge.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   It's a record. The best sales day ever for Sprint.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   Sprint, Verizon and AT&T all selling the iPhone 4 on Friday.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   Apparently a million sold in the first 24 hours according to Apple.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   That was during the pre-order period.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   And all three carriers have sold through their pre-order allotments.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   Although you said you were able to walk into a store.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   I went to the Apple store in downtown San Francisco at about 8 o'clock.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   Just walked in. Got a phone. Walked out. Two minutes. Literally.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   According to AT&T as of 4.30 p.m. Eastern on Friday they'd activated a record number of iPhones.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   In fact were on track to double their previous record for activations in a single day.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   How much of this? I think some of this.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   I remember when Michael Jackson died that his records went back to number one again.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   Do you think any of this is in response to Steve Jobs death that people said I want to support him by buying a new iPhone?
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   No, I think it's momentum.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   It's just the big mo?
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   I don't know.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   I mean why would -- is it Sprint in the mix suddenly that makes the difference?
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   Well that adds to the number of people that already have Sprint accounts or they want to continue with Sprint.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   Perhaps there was pent up demand in Verizon for people who said I'm not going to buy an iPhone 4 because I knew a new one will be out.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   My producer got an iPhone 4S because he had a 3GS.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   Rocky waited. He waited.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   What do you think Om?
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   I think there was a lot of people looking to upgrade their iPhone 3GS and that's what you're seeing is the big demand from those people.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   And new buyers, I think people still like buying the iPhone because it just still has that appeal and has a certain cash shave which hasn't gone away even though many millions have been sold.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   And I think that's what you're seeing. And people -- a lot of times we get caught up in the gadget talk.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   But what really is happening is that when you see someone holding an iPhone or an iPad, I think what you're seeing is an advertisement for that product.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   So all your friends see you using an iPhone or an iPad and that creates a cascading effect. And I think that's exactly what is happening right now.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   If you remember, like during the early 1990s, suddenly Honda Civic became the car to own amongst certain kind of people.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   And then the sales just took off for that thing. And I think that's the same kind of cycle you're beginning to see for the iPhone as well.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   I think there's a lot of people who want to buy.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   Do you think this is winning users off of Android though? I don't think it's stealing any Android users. It might be stealing users from Blackbird.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   No, in fact Google, when they made their quarterly announcements, they've activated -- or there are 190 million iPhone -- Android phones easily beating the iPhone, right?
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   I think again, you know, we'd like to see everything in black and white. And it's not like that. I think what these two companies are seeing is massive growth at the expense of Nokia, at the expense of Blackberry, more importantly at the expense of feature phones, which are essentially coming to end of life, right?
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   I think that whole business -- look at LG, Sony, Ericsson -- these are the companies which are actually falling apart.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   Yeah, no kidding. In fact Sony's buying out its stake in Ericsson. You're seeing a rim struggle, obviously. The Blackberry outage this week just added fuel to the fire.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   Nokia -- well, the jury's still out. It's possible that Nokia can pull it out with a C-Ray phone, this new Windows mobile phone 7 that will come out sometime soon.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   But right now it's Apple versus Google, isn't it? I mean, that's really what it is.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   It's not Apple versus Google. It's Apple and Google versus everybody else.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   I think let's not get confused, because these guys are -- they have developed Internet-centric mobile platforms, whereas the other platforms are still very traditional smartphone platforms and very traditional feature phone platforms.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   So that's -- the movement is towards Internet-enabled mobile platforms. I think if you look at what's happening with Samsung's BadaOS platform, they're doing spectacularly well in certain parts of the world, because it was built from scratch for a mobile Internet environment.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   And I think you're seeing that behavior. People want that. People want their Foursquare and their Facebook and their QQ or whatever it is on their mobile phones.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   And I think a lot of the older platforms cannot keep up with the app momentum.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   And of course, in less affluent nations, the cost of a data plan and a smartphone is so high that -- do you think this Bada phone is aimed at that market?
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   I think so. I think Bada is doing really well in some of the new telecom economies.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   But a friend of mine just came back from India, and he was in a little town in the rest of India. And he basically saw almost everybody had an iPhone there, even though --
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   That's amazing.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   Yeah, and it cost like $1,000, which is a lot of money, and people were buying those.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   And I think there is the -- just like it's an aspirational quality to owning a Samsung or an iPhone, because it just is one of those things.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   It's like owning a Gucci bag. It doesn't matter if you don't have the money. You just want to own it. And I think that's what has happened with these two platforms.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   But do you think there's that feeling about Android? I mean, you don't see towns in India that all are using Android phones.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   Well, there's a lot of lower-end Android phones which are manufactured by local Indian manufacturers or local Chinese manufacturers, which are doing spectacularly well.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   Android's doing very well in China, isn't it?
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   And it's doing pretty well in India and Indonesia and other of these places where they have the lower-cost devices.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   I think there is a company in Taiwan called MediaTek, and they make a mobile chip platform which is aimed squarely at lower-end consumers and lower-end Android smartphones.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   And they're doing really well. I mean, you're going to see more of that, like more of innovation on the lower end of the spectrum from Android.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   And again, it's the same thing we saw with the Microsoft Windows. We saw a lot of smaller, lesser-known brands were able to establish themselves because of Windows.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   And I think we're going to see the same thing with Android, too.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   I don't know if I can agree, though, that it's not Google versus Apple. I mean, Google and Apple are certainly acting as if it's a zero-sum game.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   You're saying it's not a zero-sum game that both of them are going to win in this?
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   Vote for one.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   Okay. So I'm going to take a poll. This is GoPollGo. You asked this question, Robert Scoble.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   Will your next phone be an iOS-based one or an Android-based one?
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   Or I think my next phone is actually going to be, believe it or not, the C-Ray, the Nokia. We don't know what it's going to be called.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   But Android, 59 percent compared to 30 percent for Apple.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   And this shows what the market's up against. When Ohm says it's an Android and Apple thing against everybody else, this is what's going on.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   Very few people want anything other than an Android or an Apple phone.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   Windows is hanging in there with 9 percent. Everybody else is chasing 2 percent.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   Now, this was asked on Facebook, Twitter, and Google+. 3,000 people have answered this.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   So this is the early adopter audience. If we asked USA Today, probably they would have a different answer.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   But this shows what they're up against.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   That's really interesting.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   Now, I'd like to know what percentage of fake Apple iPhones are floating around India and China.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   Or China. There's a ton in China.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   Because I get solicitations.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   When I was in China, I saw a whole bunch.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   Yeah. I mean, Pakistan sells a good iPhone for like less than $100. It looks just like an iPhone.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   It specs out pretty much the same, except it doesn't have the iris or whatever they call it.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   In fact, some of them run Android. I've seen iPhones. They say iPhone.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   And they look just like the Apple logo.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   Some of them have two SIM slots and replaceable batteries.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   Actually, most of them have two SIM slots.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   They have replaceable batteries, right?
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   Right. All the stuff that you'd like to have.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   I think there is a company in China which is trying to make cars that look like Rolls-Royce, but that doesn't make them Rolls-Royce.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   I'll just leave it at that.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   No, but if what you say is true and people are just buying these things because they're Gucci bags,
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   then I don't think anybody cares whether it really operates exactly like an iPhone or not.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   Yeah, but like I don't know what your point is, John, because if you looked at the latest quarterly numbers or last six quarters of Apple's sales,
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   they've been growing internationally, not just in the US.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   I don't have a point. It was a question. I wonder how many phones are fake.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   Who knows? It's pretty hard to tell at this point whether they're fake or for real.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   But the thing is what you're seeing is people want to own that product, right?
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   So much so that they will buy a fake one.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   So much so that they will set up a fake store in China to sell real Apple products.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   So that kind of tells you the momentum with that.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   So I don't want to be the guy talking Apple story here, but I'm just saying we have two different camps on the mobile web.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   One is on the mobile industry.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   One is the Internet neighbor camp, which is Apple and Google.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   And then there is the other guys. And I think what you're seeing is Apple and Google are winning out this war.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   I think that's a pretty big challenge for everybody, including Microsoft and Nokia.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   I would not put a lot in those two companies just yet because by the time they gather any kind of momentum in the market,
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   both Android and Apple iOS would have had another six to eight months or more to consolidate their position.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   Right. Yeah, Microsoft really is the lag horse.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   The starting gate opened two years, three years ago. Microsoft's finally up at the starting line.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   I have to say the new features in the 4S are not compelling.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   First of all, I think Apple missed a bet because it looks exactly like the iPhone 4.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   So if that Gucci bag, if that status thing is what you're all about, there's a 4 and there's a 4S. Tell the difference.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   The one's white.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   Yeah, it's because it's white. But really it's exactly the same or at least appears to be exactly the same.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   There are some differences. The antenna has been changed. Not that there was anything wrong with the old one, but it's been changed.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   You had to hold it differently.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   Yeah. But mostly it's internal. There's a double speed processor, which is underclocked.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   According to Anand's tech, it's only running at 800 megahertz, not even as fast as the iPad 2, as you'd use iPad 2.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   We now know from the teardowns, 512 megabytes of RAM, there was some thought maybe they'd have more.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   No, it's the same as, in fact, the iPad 2.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   It is faster though.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   It feels faster. In fact, it's the fastest browser, I would say. And Anand even said that in their tests, I think the word they used was "smoked" all the other phones.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   But did you feel like the iPhone 4 is slow? No.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   No, but when my son and I were playing with it, you could tell. Some people have put videos up side by side. You can tell it's different.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   He said we switched him over to Verizon from AT&T. We finally are getting there.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   That may be a difference.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   No, actually Verizon is supposedly slower than AT&T, but he said his downloads sped up, which might be because Verizon is a better network, but God knows.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   Yeah, it might be because other people are using AT&T. You know, AT&T's HSPA+ is now supported by the phone, so that is a difference.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   But those are geeky facts that most people don't care about.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   The thing they're going to really notice, of course, iOS 5, but you can upgrade your old phone to iOS 5 and get the new notifications, which are very cool, things like that.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   I do like the notifications, although this is ripped straight off of Android.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   I have those on my iPhone 4. A lot of the iOS 5. The only real differences are the speed, the camera, and Siri.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   And Siri. The camera is good. I've been taking a lot of pictures of the camera.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   I think it now absolutely replaces a point-and-shoot, especially because you can press the top volume button.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   Boy, I feel bad for Lisa Bettany. You know, her Camera Plus application made it possible to take a picture by pressing the volume button,
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   and people pulled it from the Apple Store. And then, of course, what do they do? They put it in.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   But it's how it should be. This is now like a point-and-shoot camera. 8 megapixels. It does very well in relatively low light.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   They've got their HDR now. It takes three images, not two, they said. But the biggest difference is Siri, absolutely.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   So let's talk a little bit about Siri. You don't like Siri?
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   It's a gimmick.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   Watch this. I think this is --
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   You're going to go to the -- get ready for a half an hour of silliness.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   Buy John C. Dvorak dinner at Cyrus, Tuesday at 7 p.m.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   Why?
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   Did you turn on your audio? Your audio looks like it's off.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   Oh, yeah. I'm feeding you audio now on this --
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   The audio is off.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   Oh, it's off. Well, that shouldn't make any difference. So I found two mentions with Cyrus. Okay, there's Cyrus. I'm going to say yes.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   It's now going to add that to my appointment calendar. It's going to put Cyrus in there.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   I can even say, "Tell John C. Dvorak we're having dinner at Cyrus, Tuesday at 7 p.m."
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   And it will send you a text message. And all of this works pretty reliably.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   Where is it sending me this text?
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   Well, if I don't have your text message number, it won't work.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   Oh, okay. Well, that's kind of a drawback.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   Yeah, well, you've got to be in my contacts. What, it's going to magically find your cell phone number?
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   It could. It could. If it was the genius that they claim it to be, it could look around.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   Set an alarm for 20 minutes from now so I can wake up after John's done.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   There's a number of systems out there that have pretty much everybody's personal information it can tap into.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   Now, we have pinpointed the big problem with speech recognition, which is John keeps talking, right?
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   And unfortunately, Siri still thinks I'm giving it a message.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   So not only is it going to get my message, but because I didn't press stop, it's going to have everything I'm saying, John's saying.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   And I have kids who whenever they --
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   Or will it just crash?
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   Yeah. Whenever -- when I watch, I'll stop.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   I have kids, whenever I start doing this kind of thing -- look at this.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   Wow.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   It's going to check what? All of this. Set an alarm for 20 minutes from now so I can wake up after John.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   There's a number of the systems that you know we have concluded the big problem with speech recognition, which John keeps talking, right?
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   That's one drawback. John's actually going to get close to something I don't like about Siri. Siri is really great if it works.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   When it works.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   Well, if it works when it works.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   I'm going to unplug it.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   The problem is it has a lot of edges, and those edges, when you go off the edges, is a very bad fall.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   Right.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   For instance, you can ask it how many people are checked in here at the Twitbrickhouse on Foursquare.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   They won't know.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   There is an answer for that. There is an API for that.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   But they don't support it.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   It's not hooked up to Siri, and it fails badly. It takes you off to Google, and Google doesn't have an answer to that.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   Right. So here's my supposition. Two things I think will happen.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   First of all, people are complaining because Siri did not come out on, for instance, the iPad 2, and they killed the Siri app, so you can't use that, or the iPhone 4.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   Second problem is that there is no apparent API yet. If you were Foursquare, you'd sure love to hook into that, right?
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   I suspect Apple will do that. One of the things we noted right away is that Siri's servers were just slammed.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   Half the time in the first 24 hours, it would say, "I'm sorry, my server's down."
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   But that will calm down.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   Right. And I think Apple wisely is rolling this out slowly. I suspect they will put it on the iPhone 4 and the iPad 2.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   The two guys who built it came out to my house two years ago. The stuff that is on the iPhone is completely rewritten from then.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   It's clear it's not the old Siri. Yeah.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   And it's missing some of the features that the old one used to have. The old one used to be…
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   You used to work with OpenTable. I can make a reservation.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   You could do that. You could also ask, "Make a flight for me."
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   Right.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   And it would go off and make a flight.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   These are all things Apple needs to include. And I'll tell you what, if Apple doesn't, guess who's going to? Google.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   I mean, Android's already halfway there. It has very similar voice commands. Go ahead.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   So, I will say two things. I'm just looking at this headline by Scobel, which says, "Why if you miss Siri, you'll miss the future of the web?"
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   Absolutely true.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   So, I think to kind of say that they can't get a lot of things on the edges is kind of…you're basically negating yourself, Robert.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   Second of all, when Siri did what they did in the previous life as an independent company, they really didn't roll it out at scale.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   Okay? They didn't have tens of millions of people looking to use this service almost instantaneously all the time.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   So, I think Apple has taken a step approach to it. And this involves a lot more processing power, a lot more cloud effort, I mean, oomph on the back end to make all this thing happen.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   So, it's not as easy as it seems. That said, you know, and I will actually argue with you on this…
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   Leo. The name's Leo.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   Leo. Are you kidding me?
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   I'm just teasing you.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   …is that, you know, Google has had this Google Voice commands for a very long time, almost a year or so since I wrote about it. And they haven't really done anything with it. They just haven't pushed it to the app developers, whereas Apple is taking a step approach and then they want to put this into their OS layer and then integrate it into various different applications.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   So, it's an issue of scale. You know, we would love to see all these things happen in like one day, but it takes a little bit of time. So, but look at what it does as a service right now. It is pretty cool, right?
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   It's not, I'm not saying this is the end, but this is the beginning of something really much bigger and much more profound. And I think we have to think about it in that term, like how we can take this technology and go forward with it, not rather than what…
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   And I think you're absolutely right. That two guys, they came out to my house, you know, and showed me this. That's why I fell in love with it. It's the vision of it that I fell in love with, not the edges.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   But what you said is not inconsistent. I think both of us, I think all of us, maybe except John, agree that this is a breakthrough. It's the future. This is how things are going to be going forward. And it's the first iteration. It's got to serve many more people than Siri itself had to. And so, there are edge cases. It doesn't do everything it should do.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   But that's quibbling because it will, right? That's my point, is that Apple will roll it out on all platforms. Apple will roll it out on the desktop. I think you're right, Om. And I think that they will provide an API. I hope. Now, Apple's not notorious for this, but I hope that they will provide an API.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   And the reason they will, Om, is because if they don't, Google will. Google has the transportation information. Google has the restaurant information. They know a lot more about me than Apple. This is what Mike Elgin was saying on Google+ earlier this week, that this is the beginning, but Google's the one to watch out for because they have so much data.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   What if this becomes the front end for Facebook?
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   Let's talk about data. Who has more data about us than anybody?
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   Because that check-in is also done.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   The check-in went to Facebook, right?
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   So that's frankly who's going to... Facebook, Apple, Google, all three of them, I think are well positioned. Om, maybe Google hasn't done anything because nobody put any pressure on them, but now that Apple's doing Siri, don't you think? Isn't it conceivable that Ice Cream Sandwich will have similar features?
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   Keep in mind, the Google Voice team has been doing this for a while.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   They have a lot of data. They have very good dictation.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   And if companies have been in a fight for a while, you're going to see them roll out versions over the next couple months that are pretty interesting.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   Right.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   When you see companies come out with technology, it took two years to ship just the rewrite of this.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   We're so impatient.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   It'll be over.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   People have been saying for two years, "Where's Siri? What happened? Apple bought Siri." They didn't do anything. So Om, do you think that Google will respond to Siri?
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   Well, I hope so. So my biggest fear on Google is that as a company, it has tied itself to a certain way of thinking about search, which is a box and ten blue links and advertising right next to it.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   And Siri is a different kind of technology which allows you to search in a different way. And it takes Google away from the traditional Google business model.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   I'm working on a post based on that idea. And that's the biggest challenge they have.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   And I think this is why any non web search methodology, I'm not saying non. So search is still going to be valid, but the use case is going to be very different.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   And because of that, they have a challenge. And basically Google will have to figure out, do they want to embrace this kind of change, which actually threatens their current revenue stream?
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   And I think that would be an existing, that would be an interesting problem for them to deal with. I hope they do. I hope they do.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   Because I think this is an interesting step forward for computing as we know it.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   After all, Google, you could have that, get me a flight to Paris for December 7th, and Google's got that information. They bought IATA. They've got the information. They could do that in a way that Apple cannot.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   I was just in New York and I saw a startup coming out in a month that's going to blow you away on flight search because it's going to tell you which flights to take, which flights have Wi-Fi, which flights have a better seat, and where to sit in the plane.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   It's amazing what's going to come out of us.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   Here's the question. Does Apple have the corporate DNA that would say partner with Hipmunk or partner with this new company and make Siri use that? They took that part out of Siri. They took the open table integration out. It doesn't work with Twitter. You cannot tweet from Siri.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   I bet that's coming back. Because the tool, when Siri came out to my house, they showed me the backend tool, which they never have shown publicly. And it looked like Visual Basic.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   So it's easy to do.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   It's easy to do. It's easy to hook up what the Siri API is looking for to the developer's API, the Foursquare or whatnot. They need to make it as easy as Facebook made it with verbs.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   Now with Facebook's verbs thing, RunKeeper can get data into Facebook through these simple, simple APIs. And the same thing needs to go on with Siri. I don't think they've explained that's coming. I think that's version 2.0 of Siri. And if they hook it up to every application on your iPhone, that's going to be mind-blowing.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   Would you call that a service-oriented architecture?
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   Something like that.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   I want to talk about SOAs because there's a--
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   Oh, Jesus.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   If home is going to sleep, we know we're going deep.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   Oh, on the ring. Well, I want to talk about that Steve Yegge leaked Google memo because I thought that was actually very interesting. As long as we're talking about the guts of companies and their DNA and whether they know how to take advantage of these kinds of things, this was, I thought, a fascinating memo. I'm not going to talk about it just now.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   But in a bit, I will. Steve Yegge, who's an engineer at Amazon--was an engineer at Amazon--went to Google and said, "We do everything in the world better than Amazon except for three things. And one of them is absolutely critical. And it has to do with service-oriented architecture." And I think it's actually a very--it's a little technical, but I thought it was a very interesting screed.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   So can I actually--
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   Is that fun?
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   John Scoble and Leo, I would love to get your take on the Kindle Fire and the implications of that device and that browser.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   Another good subject. We have a lot to talk about. Let's take a break and we will come back. We have so many things to talk about and we're going to get to them. Of course, Google's got a big announcement in Hong Kong. They put it off last week at CTIA saying, "Hey, we don't want to step on the rain on Steve Jobs parade." But this week they will announce.
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   I think the Nexus Prime and Ice Cream Sandwich, we'll talk about that. This is Steve Jobs' day in California. The governor declared it. Jerry Brown did. There was a memorial at Stanford today. Apple's memorial is coming up this week. We can talk a little bit about that too. All of this coming up. John C. Dvorak is here.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   Dennis Ritchie too.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   And we've got to mention Dennis Ritchie. I think that in some ways, we spent a lot of time talking about Steve and his contributions. Dennis Ritchie is right up there with them. Without Dennis Ritchie, there is no Unix, there is no Linux, there is no C programming language. So we'll talk about Dennis Ritchie as well. Anything you'd like to talk about, John?
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   No, I want to talk more about Siri.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   No, come on. You can play with it. What should he ask Siri?
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   No, I'm not going to ask her anything. I've already spent a day with this thing.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   Oh, you have played with it a little bit.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   How long will your audible ad be right now?
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   Yeah. I actually use Siri. I've been using it. I've only had, of course, the phone since Friday when it came in the mail.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   Use it for what? I mean, like seriously use it.
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   Like setting alarms, sending text messages. But I used Android that way too. I would always dictate text messages. I just find it easier.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   You know, I used to use the Android voice thing until I went to New York City and tried using it on the street.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   Well, that's the real problem is if it's noisy or your kids are going 37 Orange plus 917 and they do that. My kids do that.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   As soon as they press the, you know, I have the Ford sync. As soon as I press that button in the Ford, they start talking.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   Just to drive me nuts.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   They do it on purpose.
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   Yeah. I say, "You darn kids, get off my voice recognition."
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   I like your kids.
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   John C. I know. They're rebels like you, John C. Dvorak. NoAgendaShow.com.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   Yeah.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   Did you see the bricks that we got out there?
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   Yeah. I found it.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   Yeah. There's a couple.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   There's two.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   Yeah. We got more coming. In fact, there's a whole load of bricks out there. We got a whole, our second of three shipments of bricks is here.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   We have cut off the brick sales, but we sold 200. What did we say finally? I think 200, 2600 something like that.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   2000 bricks?
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   No, no. I'm sorry. What? Almost 2000 or over. I don't know. Anyway, close to 2000 bricks.
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   It's a lot of bricks.
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   You know what? You're going to be sitting on bricks.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   It's because I said that right. I could have gotten in trouble.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   The brick sit house.
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   Yes. John C. Dvorak. Robert Scoble is here. The Scoble-izer from Rackspace. The man who finds all these cool things. I don't know how you do it, but I guess now.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   Scoble is the king of this right now, by the way.
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   If you're a startup, what is this startup sauna there? What is that? You go in a sauna and talk to startups?
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   Yeah, from Denmark.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   No. Really?
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   Yeah.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   Wow. When they say it's a hot startup, they mean it. Oum Malik from Giga Oum.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   Hot and sweaty.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   I love. I want to ask you something a little later on, because you know Mike Yarrington got so much heat for both covering the tech industry and investing. You've been doing that for years and nobody has criticized you.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   Oum. I don't have any money.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   Not you. I'm pointing it out. You've got no money. I got no money. I spent it all on the bricks.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   I think you should do the Google search in that first.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   We'll talk about it and more in just a bit. But first I want to remind you about Citrix, those great folks at Citrix who have the great remote access software and their GoToAssist Express, which takes advantage of that very powerful backend, the remote access backend, and lets you, if you're an IT or support professional, get your job done fast, effectively, and easy. It lets you do what you do best. Access the personal computer of your client.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   Diagnose the problem and, more importantly, resolve it. I want you to try this free for 30 days just to get a sense of what you can do.
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   They have GoToAssist Express for individuals, GoToAssist corporate for teams. They have Daypasses too for those of us who support family and friends.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   It is amazing. It's cross platform, works on a Mac or a PC. You can use either and you can support either. It has unattended support so you don't have to wait for your clients to get there.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   By the way, if your clients don't have the software installed and you don't have to worry about it, you're not going to spend any time supporting the software. You merely send them a link.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   30 seconds later it's installed, it's running on their machine and you have access to it. You can do eight sessions at once. That means you can start a scan on one machine then move to the next.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   Start a install on that one, move to the next. You never have to wait for anything to complete.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   It lets you find out exactly what operating system and software is running in the background down to the point number so you know what you're dealing with.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   I can go on and on but really the best thing to do is go to this page right here. Go to assist.com/twit.
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   30 days free. Then you can decide whether you want to buy it but I know you will. I love it. I use it all the time. I know you will too.
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   We thank Citrix for their support. Go to assist.com/twit. Now they've got Go to Assist for Salesforce too. They're doing some neat stuff.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   This is a very interesting company. They've got Go to Manage. Every time I visit the site they've got new products coming out.
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   Go to assist.com/twit. Did you get Siri to say anything to you, John? What are you doing now?
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   Looking at these pictures you've been keeping on your phone.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   That's Instagram. That's not me. Don't blame me.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   Is Siri to find Leo's porn store?
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   He just got the phone on Friday. It takes Leo two weeks.
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   He's got so much porn it takes weeks to load up.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   I have to pick the pictures. The problem is the retina display and porn? Too much detail. I don't want to know.
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   Did somebody say Leo?
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   Hey Leo, can you actually turn the ringer off on the phone?
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   Yeah, why?
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   It just comes across as like distracts me from looking at you.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   Is something ringing in Ohms?
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   No, no, no. Somebody's sending you text messages.
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   Oh, that must be somebody else's phone.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   I turn mine off.
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   Yours is back.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   Oh, you hear the "boong"? I get it. I get it.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   I don't hear anything.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   It's turned off now. So you see anybody with an iPhone, when you hear the iPhone sound you kind of go, it's a little Pavlovian reaction.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   Turn it back on.
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   It's funny, that used to happen all the time.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   I'm still tuning my notifications and they just keep coming in because on Google+ and Facebook and Twitter this thing's going crazy.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   It does. It scrolls them up like crazy. Do you like the new notification system? I think it's pretty great.
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   I like it but I have to tune it so it brings me less.
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   You can go in there but exactly what I do, I say, "Look, I don't want Instagram notifications," or "Google+ is a terrible one." It'll bug you all day.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   Are you happy you bought the 4S Home? Are you happy with it?
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   I definitely am intrigued by the Siri and I'm very intrigued by the camera.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   I think there's a lot of opportunity there to innovate around the camera, camera speed.
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   I hope the app developers do some cool stuff with it. Those are two of my favorite things.
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   I definitely would love to get your take on Kindle Fire though.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   Let's talk about it.
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   I think both you and John and Scobel, three of you are really well equipped to talk about that.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   I want to get to understand, a lot of people on my Twitter feed are also asking that, "Yes, we want to know what you guys think about that." That would be pretty cool.
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   I ordered three of them. How many people have ordered one in the studio?
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   Why did you order three of them? That's what I like to know.
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   I ordered one. I did buy the new $79 Kindle, which I love because I don't need a keyboard. It's small. I could put it in my pocket.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   I'm very happy with that and that price is right.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   Fire is interesting. The Android tablets have been flops. As good as Android phones are, as bad as Android tablets are. It's an odd thing, partly because they compete against something that is truly amazing, which is the iPad 2.
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   And they didn't have leverage to get in the market. The phones, Android had leverage. All they had to do was convince one carrier to carry them that was an AT&T and all of a sudden they had leverage. People would buy the competitor.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   I think you could have a hundred companies making Android tablets and they would still not sell, including non-Android tablets like the Touchpad.
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   I think this one is going to sell a crap load.
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   So that's the question. Can Fire break that losing streak?
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   I think already they have.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   I think only from the channel. I don't see why anybody would buy. Well, the price is right, but I don't see why anyone would have anything but an iPad.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   I think I'd agree with you. And that's the question is, does the Kindle change that because it's half the price? It's an Amazon device. It's not, by the way, it's not Honeycomb. It's not that crappy Android tablet interface. It's its own, let's hope, good interface. I haven't seen it.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   But there's a lot of people who won't buy 600. This is 600 bucks once you get it out the store.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   That's too expensive.
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   $200 tablet. I mean, there's a lot of people in my family who are looking forward to getting theirs for Christmas.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   But I think it's going to sit by the it's going to just be a doorstop eventually.
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   I have to agree with you. And I'll tell you why. Why? Because I don't think I think this is the problem with reading a book on the iPad as well. Backlit color screens are not ideal for reading. I thought initially the iPad would kill the Kindle. I was sure of it.
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   I thought, why would you buy a Kindle if you can buy this multipurpose device that does that and so much more?
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   And I realized once I had the E Ink screen and compared it to the the backlit screen, there is no comparison. And I and so many other people, I think, continue to buy Kindles. It's still selling like crazy.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   The E Ink version because of that. And I wonder if Amazon's making a mistake. If Amazon's not understanding its market.
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   I don't think they're making a mistake.
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   Is because it's a good way to read.
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   Well, I think they're not dropping that.
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   No, and I think that'll do fine. I think the Kindle will disappoint. I think people get at home expecting the fire, the fire, expecting the Kindle Fire to be as good a reading experience. And it won't be because it's a backlit display.
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   You disagree?
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   I agree with that in part, but I think the Kindle Fire is a different use case than just reading books.
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   Yeah, you're thinking it's an iPad substitute.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   Yeah.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   A cheap iPad.
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   Yeah.
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   It's not.
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   It's not.
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   Well, for the very simple reason that the app back its architecture is not there. With an iPad, you've got a hundred thousand apps.
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   I agree with you.
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   You can do almost, you could do so much more with it.
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   I'm not buying everybody a $600 iPad for Christmas.
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   No, I understand. It's highly.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:46.000]   Wait, you're looking for rationalization for your cheap gift.
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   Everybody buy.
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   I just have to think that even at that, the price isn't ultimately what's going to make or break it. We've seen, you know, $99 touchpads sold like hotcakes, but I don't think you're going to see a lot of them in the wild because people are going to get it.
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   Wow, that's nice and put it back in the closet.
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   That's what's going to happen.
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   I think it's the fire is going to start well as it already has. I think Amazon has already reported really good pre-orders.
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   Amazon's got a good channel.
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   They've got a channel.
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   People just buy stuff left and right and you get a free month of their free shipping.
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   But just because something's color and touch doesn't make it an iPad. And I think that there's an ineffable difference.
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   It's not completely ineffable because, you know, we just found out for instance, Apple.
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   So when did you start using the word ineffable?
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   Right after when I learned what it meant.
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   Just never.
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   I find this a refulgent device.
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   The thing to me that I was stunned to learn is that Apple has 1000 engineers working on the A5 processor.
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   Apple's not a processor company. It's not a foundry. It's using an ARM architecture.
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   But it shows you how much optimization has gone into this device.
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:55.000]   I guarantee you they're not a thousand people working on the fire in every respect.
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   Yeah.
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   This is going to end up. I think people are going to get it.
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   This is like Google versus Bing.
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   Yeah.
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   There's not enough. They don't have enough bots.
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   Yeah.
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   Google's got 10 times as many. They're out there grinding. The worms are out there looking for stuff.
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   Amazon should stick to its E Ink.
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   I think the fire's going to be a mistake.
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:15.000]   Well, this is what Apple does so well.
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   My brother-in-law worked on the chips that are around the processor.
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   And they put a lot of effort into making sure scrolling works really well.
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   Exactly.
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   And they do things like load time optimizations that nobody else can do because the hardware and the software aren't joined.
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   Here they are.
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:35.000]   Right.
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   The same teams can work together.
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   And that's what happens when you get an Android tablet home is you say, hey, this is nice. It's the same form factor.
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   In fact, you saw that in the court case between Samsung and Apple.
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:51.000]   The judge held up a Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 and an iPad.
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   The attorney for Samsung was a mere 15 feet away and said, can you tell the difference?
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   And the attorney said, I'm not sure. That's not good.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   Let's see.
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   So, Om, there's what I think. Dvorak agrees with me. I think Robert thinks maybe the fire is going to do a little bit better.
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   He wants it to do better because of his gifts.
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   Well, I mean, go ahead. Om, one thing I'll say is there's two companies that have my credit card.
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   Well, three. B&H, Amazon.
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:23.000]   I buy everything from Amazon. I agree. I buy everything from Amazon.
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   What's B&H? The camera guys?
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   The guys who do all this stuff.
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   And they have you for what?
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   You need lights. You need cameras. You need microphones.
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.000]   I thank God B&H doesn't have my credit card.
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   Canon 5D Mark III when it comes out.
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:41.000]   When is the Mark III? Canon is having an event. Is that going to be the Mark III event?
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   Please.
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   So, Leo, on your show about three months ago or four months ago,
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   I brought up the idea of Amazon opening its own retail space, not a retail store, but having a retail space,
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   which would basically be a way for them to extend themselves more deeper into our lives.
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   And I got a little guff for that idea.
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   But you know what? I thought it was very interesting.
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:17.000]   And let's just clarify. It wasn't a place where they sell stuff. It was a place where you gather.
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.000]   You experience Amazon.
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   And I think what Kindle Fire to me looks like is the extension of Amazon store right into your life.
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   Because our user behavior is shifting away from a PC to more tablets and other devices,
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   Amazon is smart to do something like Kindle Fire so that we have a more engaging shopping experience with them.
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:48.000]   Will people spend $250 for the right to shop at Amazon?
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:52.000]   Well, I think what is going to happen, though, is they will have to give it away.
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:44:01.000]   So if you sign up for Amazon Prime, like they ship as much as you can service, you will get this device for free.
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   I think at $199 price point where they're starting at, you're already at that point where they're going to...
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:17.000]   If you start taking those daily deals, the way they're offering them on Kindle, the reader, they start doing one of those things.
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   They will drop down the price on this thing even further and make it free.
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   So this will become their retail window.
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   And I think this is...when I was thinking about retail experience, I think this is just an extension of that idea.
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   Because now we are buying a lot more things from them and a lot of it is actually digital.
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:40.000]   So they have to find a way to sell it.
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   And I think this is an interesting way for them to sell the information to us.
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:47.000]   So buy Amazon Prime and get it fired.
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:53.000]   Essentially, they're selling...it's not selling, giving away a catalog that happens to be in the form of...
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:55.000]   But keep in mind, Amazon is not just about shopping.
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:02.000]   They have music service, they have the video service now, they have cloud storage which competes with my company.
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:06.000]   But that's a big deal, I think.
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   I'll tell you what, I think if Amazon gives it away, it will be a success.
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   I don't think it's a success.
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:13.000]   If it's giving it away, it's a success.
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   $200 is giving it away.
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.000]   Give it to me for free, that's success.
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   $200 is giving it away.
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:21.000]   It's about the cost, right?
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   It's about the cost, so they're making no profit.
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:26.000]   They're hoping you're going to buy stuff to make it out.
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:27.000]   Right, right, right.
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   I think we have to step back and say, what is Amazon's business?
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:36.000]   The Amazon's business is to sell us things, you know, goods.
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   Well, you need all those things.
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:41.000]   Come on, all that porn you have, you pay for?
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   That's expensive.
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   I know, you need that.
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:46.000]   Otherwise, you know, things can get complicated.
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:52.000]   I didn't catch the guy's name, but somebody in the chat room said Amazon's Silk browser is not good.
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   I'd like to unpack on that.
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:55.000]   I'd like to see it.
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   Has anybody seen Silk?
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   No, but these guys are building...
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   Facebook is building a new media company, one where the media comes to you,
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:05.000]   and they need to know everything about you to make that happen.
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:06.000]   It's kind of the opposite.
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:07.000]   Wait a minute, it doesn't come to you.
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:10.000]   You go to Facebook and you live in Facebook and all the media is there.
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:11.000]   Right, but then it comes to you.
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:12.000]   Then it comes to you, right?
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:13.000]   It comes to you.
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:17.000]   Facebook's doing the same thing Ohm was talking about, but not in a physical space.
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:23.000]   It's creating a communal space where you hang and you participate, and that's where all your media is.
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   Fire could be that.
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:29.000]   Well, fire could be that once they study you enough, and that's what the browser's for.
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:32.000]   You're going to use the browser to do everything on the web.
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:34.000]   They're going to learn about you.
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:39.000]   Then they're going to be able to build a Facebook competitor, a media company that brings more stuff to you.
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:42.000]   You know, it's kind of interesting because we've been talking about when you talk about Siri,
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:45.000]   when you talk about Google, when you talk about fire,
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   we're talking about companies' performance dependent on them knowing all about you.
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:54.000]   Do you think people are going to turn on these companies?
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:57.000]   At some point and say, "Whoa, I'm not giving you this information.
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.000]   I don't want you to know about me."
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:00.000]   Some will.
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:01.000]   Some will.
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:03.000]   I've had lots of arguments at family marriage about this.
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   What happened with Buzz?
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.000]   Now, Buzz had a different problem.
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:07.000]   Yeah, but there was this element.
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:09.000]   No, let's look at Facebook.
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:11.000]   Facebook is the real argument versus Yahoo.
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:14.000]   Are people going to go back to Yahoo and go to the media?
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:18.000]   Yahoo.com/finance, Yahoo.com/sports, Yahoo.com/whatever.
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:22.000]   No, they are addicted to Facebook because the media comes to you,
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:25.000]   and the more you give it, the more media will come to you.
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:27.000]   And in fact, what happens is you go into denial.
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:29.000]   Yet another reason to avoid Facebook.
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:34.000]   Yes, you forget or you intentionally forget what you're giving up,
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:35.000]   and you're giving up a lot.
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:37.000]   They know everything.
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:40.000]   They follow you on the web even when you're not on your Facebook page.
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:42.000]   And I think that at some point --
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:43.000]   And they're not the only ones.
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:44.000]   Google's going to have to do it too.
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:45.000]   Google's going to do it.
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.000]   Amazon is going to do it if this fire works.
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:49.000]   I know the teams are studying the same data at Google.
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:51.000]   They're just being careful, and they're going to wait to see
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:53.000]   what freaks people out and not go quite that far.
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:56.000]   And they're just happy that Facebook is out there cutting through the bush.
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:57.000]   So here's the question.
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:58.000]   Let me ask the panel this question.
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:01.000]   Should people freak out or does it not matter?
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:02.000]   It's anonymized, who cares?
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:04.000]   Should people be worried?
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:07.000]   Yeah, to a large extent we should be.
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:12.000]   And we need to basically be able to -- I think my biggest --
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:17.000]   more than the worry part, I need companies to be upfront, honest,
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:21.000]   and use simple English to describe what they're doing with my information.
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:22.000]   That's all.
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:28.000]   And after that, as a person, I should be able to make reasonable decisions
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   based on that data we are provided.
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   Do you think Facebook's new user agreements,
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:35.000]   which are rewritten in plain English, are sufficient?
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:36.000]   No, they're not.
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:38.000]   They're still very complicated.
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:41.000]   They're still pretty convoluted, and they take forever.
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:45.000]   I prefer not to use Facebook for a lot of things.
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:49.000]   I actually make it a very active choice of not using Facebook,
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:54.000]   unless there are a lot of apps I can't use without Facebook, so I use them.
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:57.000]   But it's mostly for work purposes.
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:03.000]   I don't engage with Facebook as much as I used to,
[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:07.000]   because I think there is a lot more information which is in that system,
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:10.000]   and it's still not clear what they're doing with it.
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:12.000]   They do not talk about it.
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:16.000]   I think they don't even know their strategy.
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:19.000]   When I talked to Sheryl Sandberg there and Mark,
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:22.000]   they don't even know where they're going.
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   I believe they're going to study everything about everything,
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   not just even everything about you,
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:30.000]   everything about the physical environment you live in,
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:35.000]   because the more they know about that, the more media they can bring to you.
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:40.000]   In the social network, Jesse Eisenberg, Aaron Sorkin puts the words in his mouth, says,
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:44.000]   "When Eduardo Saverin is trying to sell Facebook,
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:48.000]   no, I don't want to sell ads. We don't even know what this is."
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:53.000]   What's interesting is I think seven years later we still don't know what it is.
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:56.000]   I do admire Facebook for one thing.
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:01.000]   They have been willing to resist people saying, "You've got to monetize.
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:04.000]   You've got to figure out what it is. You've got to be something."
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:07.000]   They are willing to say, "We don't know what it is yet. Let's see."
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:12.000]   At some point they're going to have to decide what they are, but I actually kind of admire that.
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:16.000]   I call these things contextual engines, and Facebook's not the only one.
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:18.000]   They're messaging buses.
[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:21.000]   I put a message in there and it decides whether John sees that message
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:24.000]   or somebody in the audience sees that message or my wife sees that message.
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:27.000]   They're not very clear how this edge algorithm works either. They're very...
[00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:29.000]   You can figure out how it works.
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:31.000]   It's a little spooky. Can you?
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:35.000]   It's noise control. It's just removing noise and deciding where that message goes.
[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:38.000]   The problem is we have no knobs to control it.
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:40.000]   I need a knob.
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:42.000]   Mark says nobody wants knobs.
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:45.000]   He's probably right for the 99% of the people.
[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:49.000]   For us, for the three of us at this table, we want knobs.
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:52.000]   Look at your ham radio. It has lots of knobs.
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:54.000]   John, should we worry...
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:56.000]   You're a knob-meister.
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:58.000]   Can I look at your ham radio?
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:50:59.000]   You've got knobs here.
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:00.000]   Are you a ham-home?
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:03.000]   No, I'm not, but I want to see what it looks like.
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:05.000]   Oh, it's really cool. Well, you've got to come up here.
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:07.000]   Next time you come up here, I'll show you.
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:08.000]   He's got a great rig.
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:10.000]   We've got a whole ham radio corner.
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:11.000]   He has the rig of the...
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:13.000]   Get ready for this.
[00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:16.000]   We've got all this noise, this RF noise coming out of this building.
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:18.000]   Who would have thunk that?
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:21.000]   We put an antenna on the building and it's like...
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:23.000]   You can't hear a thing.
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:27.000]   We're trying to figure out how we're going to use this great ham setup we've got.
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:29.000]   I've got an AM transmitter there.
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:31.000]   It's beautiful. It's state-of-the-art.
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:33.000]   A lot of it's ICOM.
[00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:35.000]   State-of-the-art of 1960?
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:38.000]   Well, there's 1960, but there's also brand new stuff.
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:39.000]   There's digital stuff.
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:41.000]   So, get this. ICOM.
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:43.000]   I talked to Ray Novak from ICOM today.
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:45.000]   So, the ICOM has already...
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:48.000]   There's an interesting nexus between analog hams,
[00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:51.000]   which are really the oldest form of technology in the last century,
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:53.000]   and the modern digital world.
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:55.000]   What they have now is they have...
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:58.000]   There's a guy in Pennsylvania.
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:00.000]   He is a cell phone billionaire.
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:02.000]   He made a lot of money. He's a devoted ham.
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:04.000]   He only... He built...
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:06.000]   Is he a fan of the Twitch show?
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:10.000]   Apparently, because he built... He's got 150 feet tall towers, like tons of them.
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:12.000]   He's got 12...
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:14.000]   Just for his ham rig?
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:16.000]   He's got 12 7800s. They're $12,000 each.
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:20.000]   He's got... He uses it four times a year for contesting and doesn't use it.
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:24.000]   So, they're going to put an ICOM 7800 at the base of that...
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:26.000]   One of those antennas.
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:28.000]   It's going to be connected via the Internet to this 7800.
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:31.000]   You turn the knob here, it turns the knob in Pennsylvania.
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:32.000]   I'll be listening...
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:34.000]   You'll be like Voice of America.
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:35.000]   I'll be listening...
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:37.000]   Broadcasting to Saudi Arabia.
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:38.000]   Hello, world!
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:40.000]   So, that's going to be very... So, you got to...
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:42.000]   Except what happens when the earthquake hits?
[00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:43.000]   The Internet's going to go...
[00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:48.000]   There is the 7800. That's the ICOM 7800 below it, the 9100.
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:50.000]   The Dorometer there from Mike Dorough. Thank you.
[00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:52.000]   The couple of handy talkies there.
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:54.000]   But John's also a ham. John's a technician.
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:56.000]   Why don't we get a...
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:59.000]   Why don't you get a first-class phone and let's set up a real...
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:01.000]   Well, show them the Collins!
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:05.000]   What about a short-wave radio station running through those big antennas that this guy's got?
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:06.000]   Actually, we probably could do that.
[00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:07.000]   I think so.
[00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:09.000]   Wouldn't that be cool? Forget the Internet. Let's go back to radio.
[00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:11.000]   No, let's go and get those...
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:12.000]   That was like...
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:15.000]   There's a real report here in the United States...
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:18.000]   Look at that. That's the AM transmitter. The Collins...
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:21.000]   1961 Collins AM transmitter that works.
[00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:24.000]   Mike Dorough refitted it and it worked.
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:27.000]   That's Jammer B. who's opening it up. He's firing it up right now.
[00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:29.000]   That is pretty cool.
[00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:31.000]   It's pretty amazing, isn't it?
[00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:32.000]   It's cool.
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:35.000]   It's the only thing that's going to stay after in the earthquake.
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:39.000]   Frankly, that's one of the reasons the hams are interested.
[00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:43.000]   Because in emergency services, when there's a Katrina,
[00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:46.000]   when there's a hurricane, when there were tornadoes in Alabama...
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:48.000]   Yep, the only guys still on the air are the hams.
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:50.000]   And that's why you became a ham, right?
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:51.000]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:52.000]   Survivalist type of thing?
[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:55.000]   Yeah, Dad, I've got a couple guns.
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:57.000]   And you put the gold... you buried the gold in the backyard?
[00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:59.000]   I heard more than a couple.
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:01.000]   Do you have a gun collection?
[00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:04.000]   I didn't say I had a gun collection.
[00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:05.000]   Does he really?
[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:08.000]   I don't know. My son has a gun collection.
[00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:11.000]   Your son? Your 16-year-old, 17-year-old son?
[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:13.000]   Yeah. It's not in his name, but yeah.
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:16.000]   So that's just saying you have a gun collection.
[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:20.000]   No, it's not mine. His stepdad's gun...
[00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:23.000]   Well, if you live in Petaluma, you've got to have a pickup and a gun rack.
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:26.000]   And a dog named Yeller.
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:30.000]   Let's talk about this Google engineer who shared his memo accidentally on the Google+ platform.
[00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:32.000]   Can I actually just interrupt you for one minute?
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:33.000]   Yes.
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:35.000]   Since we were talking about hams and everything.
[00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:40.000]   What's going on with you, Scoble? How did you lose so much weight?
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:41.000]   I didn't lose any weight.
[00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:43.000]   He just wears less clothes.
[00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:46.000]   No, you look so much lighter.
[00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:50.000]   That's because I sit in front of three big monitors now all day long.
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:52.000]   You do look good. Have you been working out?
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:53.000]   No, not at all.
[00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:55.000]   You look good.
[00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:57.000]   I'm just happier, man.
[00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:58.000]   Ohm is just a charmer, that's all.
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:54:59.000]   Thank you, Ohm.
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:03.000]   No, I'm just trying to see what's going on there because I need to lose some weight.
[00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:06.000]   Well, now, Ohm, I know since your heart attack you've very focused on fitness.
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:08.000]   You've been taking care of yourself, right?
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:10.000]   Some days.
[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:11.000]   I hope you are.
[00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:16.000]   You know, I think with Steve Jobs passing, I have to say in all seriousness,
[00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:20.000]   it made me really start to think that we have this whole generation of people,
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:25.000]   roughly my age, D was 56, I'm 54, who pioneers, people like Dennis Ritchie,
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:27.000]   who's a little older, he was 70.
[00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:31.000]   But this is a generation that transformed the world in the last 30 years.
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:35.000]   Take care of yourself, guys. Stop eating the Doritos.
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:36.000]   Well.
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:38.000]   Because we want you to stick around.
[00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:41.000]   It's sitting in front of those three nice monitors that really is --
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:42.000]   Yeah, no kidding.
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:46.000]   It's a little easy to just kind of sit on your butt and keep going.
[00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:48.000]   But Ohm, I know you go to the gym.
[00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:50.000]   Use a stand-up desk. That's the latest trend.
[00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:51.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:54.000]   When I saw Spolsky's office, he has this.
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:55.000]   You have a stand-up desk?
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:59.000]   No, but I wear these shoes that --
[00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:00.000]   What are these shoes?
[00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:02.000]   They should have warned us first.
[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:04.000]   Whoo!
[00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:10.000]   They're MBTs, they're rock, you can't stand still, and so you're always moving.
[00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:11.000]   Yeah?
[00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:12.000]   Yeah, supposedly that's --
[00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:13.000]   So you end up sitting down all the time.
[00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:14.000]   Yeah, right. I'm sorry.
[00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:15.000]   I --
[00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:16.000]   On your ball.
[00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:17.000]   It's a balanced ball.
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:18.000]   Where's your ball?
[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:19.000]   He doesn't use the ball anymore.
[00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:21.000]   I still use the ball. It's in there. I just don't use it out here.
[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:25.000]   They're Herman Munster shoes. No, they're rocker shoes. You're always rocking on those.
[00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:30.000]   See, that's -- when you do something like that, that's when I know I'm glad I'm not in --
[00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:32.000]   [laughter]
[00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:36.000]   I pity John and Robert, who have to smell your feet now.
[00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:38.000]   No, no, they smell delicious.
[00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:39.000]   Luckily they have a lot of --
[00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:40.000]   Like a daffodil.
[00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:42.000]   Yeah, right.
[00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:47.000]   All right, I'm going to take a break on that note, and then we'll come back and talk about service-oriented architecture.
[00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:50.000]   I know you've been -- you're hanging out with tender hooks to talk about that.
[00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:52.000]   Can I go get a break?
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:53.000]   Take a break. Everybody take a break.
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:55.000]   Can we go get some whiskey before we go out there?
[00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:56.000]   Go relax.
[00:56:56.000 --> 00:57:00.000]   I remember when I was on your radius show and you'd run down the hall during a commercial.
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:02.000]   [laughter]
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:03.000]   I'll be back in half an hour.
[00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:06.000]   ♪ They're reaching the end ♪
[00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:10.000]   Go -- go -- go -- if you want to take a break, too.
[00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:15.000]   In fact, the whole studio audience, if you want to go to the bathroom, if you want to take a break, just go right ahead.
[00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:21.000]   Be my guest, because right now we're going to take a break ourselves and talk about backup.
[00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:24.000]   Backup done right.
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:37.000]   It's called Carbonite, and I don't need to tell you if you've been listening to our shows that carbonite.com is the place to go to find out more about, I think, the simple best backup system and cloud storage system out there.
[00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:40.000]   It's very affordable, $59 a year.
[00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:43.000]   They don't count how many bytes or gigabytes you're saving.
[00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:46.000]   It's just everything on your internal drive.
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:47.000]   They have a business version.
[00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:52.000]   If you do want to backup multiple computers or multiple hard drives or network drives -- I think the audience took me seriously.
[00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:54.000]   They're all leaving.
[00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:55.000]   Bye. See you.
[00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:56.000]   It's great knowing you.
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:58.000]   Everybody's getting up and walking out.
[00:57:58.000 --> 00:57:59.000]   Go ahead.
[00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:00.000]   Please do.
[00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:02.000]   Go right ahead.
[00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:07.000]   As dongle bypass says in our chat room, carbonite rocks.
[00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:10.000]   You know, I'll tell you who says carbonite rocks.
[00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:17.000]   The people whose files have been recovered, restored by carbonite, now to date, 7 billion files restored.
[00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:22.000]   That's 7 billion files that would have been lost forever if their owners hadn't been using carbonite.
[00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:26.000]   Now, if you're not using a backup system, please, you've got to take a look at that.
[00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:30.000]   Even if you are, if your backup's sitting next to the computer, you still need offsite backup.
[00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:32.000]   Carbonite is automatic.
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:33.000]   You don't have to remember to do it.
[00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:34.000]   It happens all the time.
[00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:41.000]   Lion and all versions of OS X, yes, it works great with Lion, works great on Windows as well.
[00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:45.000]   Unlimited backup, $59 per year per computer.
[00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:48.000]   Now, I want you to try it for free for two weeks, and I'll tell you why.
[00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:50.000]   It uses your Internet connection.
[00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:52.000]   So I want to make sure you have enough speed.
[00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:53.000]   It will not slow you down.
[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:57.000]   It will not slow your connection down and make sure that it's graceful, stays out of the way.
[00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:59.000]   But for that reason, if you have a slow connection, it might take a while.
[00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:03.000]   So I want you to try it free for two weeks and see how it works for you.
[00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:08.000]   Usually, for most people, two weeks is enough to do that full backup, get it started.
[00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:11.000]   And after that, it just keeps it backed up all the time.
[00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:13.000]   You make a change to the document, it's backed up within seconds.
[00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:15.000]   You never lose any data.
[00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:20.000]   Carbonite.com, use the offer code TWIT to try it free.
[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:21.000]   You don't need a credit card.
[00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:22.000]   Just try it free for two weeks.
[00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:23.000]   See what you think.
[00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:29.000]   If you decide you want to buy, use TWIT again, and you'll get 14 months for $59.
[00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:31.000]   That's 14 months instead of 12.
[00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:33.000]   It really is a good deal.
[00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:35.000]   For business, Carbonite Business 2, that's at the same page.
[00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:38.000]   Carbonite.com.
[00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:39.000]   It is cloud storage.
[00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:42.000]   You can access your data anytime from any computer.
[00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:44.000]   You just log on to your Carbonite account.
[00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:46.000]   They, of course, have smartphone apps, even a BlackBerry app.
[00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:49.000]   BlackBerry, Android, iPhone, iPad.
[00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:50.000]   Carbonite.com.
[00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:54.000]   You got to back it up to get it back to do it right with Carbonite.
[00:59:54.000 --> 01:00:00.000]   So John C. Dvorak and Robert Scoble are out back smoking a Doobie,
[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:04.000]   so it's just you and me.
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000]   Oh, Malik.
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:07.000]   Can I go have a smoke a Doobie?
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000]   Go smoke a Doobie.
[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:10.000]   Go smoke a Doobie.
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.000]   Sir, I need to get one.
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:14.000]   Actually, that's the funniest thing that Siri says if you say --
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:17.000]   if you tell Siri, "I want to buy some weed," it looks for head shops.
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:20.000]   If you say, "I want to buy some drugs,"
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:23.000]   it gives you the names of nearby drug rehab centers.
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:24.000]   Yeah.
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000]   There's a lot of kind of wit that went into this.
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:29.000]   Is this the original Siri guys that put the wit in there?
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.000]   Yeah, they're still there.
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:31.000]   I think it's very funny.
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.000]   Yeah.
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:33.000]   That's it.
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:34.000]   So I wanted to plug something.
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:35.000]   What's that?
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:36.000]   I was at the old cottage.
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:40.000]   You had a bunch of stuff from Rubio Spice.
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:41.000]   We did.
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:42.000]   Griller's Rub.
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:43.000]   Yeah.
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.000]   Did you try that stuff?
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:45.000]   I had a thing of it.
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:46.000]   It's in a guy in Laredo Techs.
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000]   You can look him up on Griller's Rub, Rubio Spice.
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:49.000]   Outstanding.
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:52.000]   I used to make my own rub for pork ribs.
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:55.000]   You took that -- you know, we had that stuff sitting around for a long time,
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:58.000]   and I'm so glad you took it home because I never get around to -- you're a griller.
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:00:59.000]   Yeah.
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:00.000]   That's awesome.
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:06.000]   And so as a barbecue rub for ribs or pork, it's absolutely outstanding.
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000]   In fact, I use it instead of my own formula.
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.000]   That's amazing.
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:13.000]   So anyway, I wanted to thank the guy who dropped it off, Rubio.
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:14.000]   And drop some more off.
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:15.000]   John will use it.
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:18.000]   Now, are you going to take home Fuzzy's Fuzzy Dust?
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.000]   Well, I was looking.
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:20.000]   You have three of them back there.
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:21.000]   You can have some Fuzzy Dust.
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:22.000]   Somebody has to drop this off.
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:23.000]   Yep.
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:24.000]   That's from Fuzzy's Tacos.
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:25.000]   Fuzzy's Tacos.
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.000]   It doesn't sound really too appetizing.
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:29.000]   It's not that Italian, is it?
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:30.000]   I think it looks good.
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.000]   So where is Fuzzy's Taco?
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:32.000]   I think they're in Laredo.
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:33.000]   No.
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:34.000]   No, I don't know where they are.
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:35.000]   El Paso.
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:36.000]   Yeah?
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:37.000]   They're all over.
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:38.000]   Fuzzy's is all over.
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:39.000]   I never heard of them.
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:40.000]   No.
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:41.000]   Well, they're all over the southeast.
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:42.000]   I should say.
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.000]   So, okay.
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:46.000]   Should I even bother with this Steve Yegge?
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:51.000]   Okay, let me talk about this quickly and then tell me if I'm completely wasting my energy.
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:52.000]   He said something interesting.
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:02:00.000]   He said that back in 2004, 2005, Jeff Bezos issued an edict, which apparently he does
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.000]   a lot.
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:05.000]   And because Bezos rules with an iron fist, according to Yegge, everybody had to do it.
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:11.000]   He basically said from now on, and apparently there's a lot of software written at Amazon.
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:12.000]   I guess that makes sense.
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:19.000]   From now on, all the software we write has to have an interface, has to have an API,
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:23.000]   has to be accessible to everybody else in the company.
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:26.000]   Others have to be able to use it.
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:29.000]   It was an interesting decision.
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:34.000]   He says all teams will henceforth expose their data and functionality through service interfaces.
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:38.000]   Teams must communicate with each other through these interfaces.
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000]   So you have to eat your own dog food.
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:44.000]   There will be no other form of interprocess communication allowed.
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:48.000]   No direct linking, no direct reads of another team's data store, no shared memory model,
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000]   no back doors whatsoever.
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:53.000]   You have to use these service calls.
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:58.000]   It could be Pub/Sub, it could be Corba, it could even be HTTP, but you've got to use it.
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:03.000]   And by doing so, Yegge says, now it was painful, but seven years later, and it's not going to
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:08.000]   be a long time until later, Amazon, and you're seeing the benefit of this with Amazon Web Services,
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:11.000]   EC2, everything has an interface.
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:16.000]   And everything is exposed in a way that programmers can use it.
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000]   He says this is what Google doesn't do.
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:23.000]   And he points specifically to Google+ saying Google+ is a silo.
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000]   They have one simple API.
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000]   What is he saying?
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:30.000]   And he says the problem Google+ is having getting those APIs published.
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:31.000]   It's a read-only API.
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:32.000]   You can't write.
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:37.000]   He says the problem Google+ is having, and Google in general is having, is they lack
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:43.000]   this mandate to make sure you have a service interface for everything.
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000]   I thought that was really interesting.
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:48.000]   Once I understood it, I had to read about 80 times.
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:49.000]   I agree with him.
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:53.000]   It helps my theory about Google+ being the next Orkut, but that's another story.
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:54.000]   They killed Orkut.
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:55.000]   Did they kill Orkut?
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000]   They killed Buzz, they killed Jaiku.
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.000]   I don't think they killed Orkut.
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.000]   They didn't kill Orkut.
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000]   There's too many Brazilians still in it.
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000]   Not many left, apparently.
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:09.000]   I agree with the Yegi, but they're in a deep hole, and the way to dig out of a hole isn't
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.000]   to do it all at once.
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:14.000]   For instance, if they turned on a write API, it would get noisy like Buzz would.
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:17.000]   There's no noise controls on Google+
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:18.000]   Well, do it in-house then.
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:19.000]   Do it in-house.
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000]   Make Googlers use it.
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:22.000]   What do you think, Om?
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:25.000]   When I said SOA, you went, "Ugh."
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:29.000]   But you cover enterprise more than anybody else sitting at this table.
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:35.000]   I think companies have their DNA.
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:43.000]   Whether it's Jeff Bezos or whatever it might be, Amazon has a company developed a certain
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:49.000]   way of thinking and doing things, which is building APIs for everything they do, and
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:52.000]   it now has become prevalent in their business.
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:05:01.000]   Google, on the other hand, has been dealing with the social and all these new services
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000]   in a reactive sort of way.
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:08.000]   They haven't been able to take the leadership position.
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:15.000]   In order to make such changes, which are transformative, you need to be a leader in a certain kind
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:18.000]   of thing, and they have not been able to do it.
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:21.000]   I think this is a huge problem.
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:27.000]   They should have, by now, Google Docs should have better APIs.
[01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:34.000]   They should be using Google Docs to do more interesting things than just become Microsoft
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:35.000]   Office Online.
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:40.000]   It could be a much bigger platform than it really is today.
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:45.000]   The reason why they haven't been able to do it is because they have been like, "Okay, let's
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:50.800]   catch up to Microsoft and do it a little better," instead of saying, "How do we reinvent the
[01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:54.600]   idea of work and how do people collaborate?"
[01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:57.800]   I think that's a bigger issue.
[01:05:57.800 --> 01:06:01.800]   Isn't that what's wrong with Microsoft, too?
[01:06:01.800 --> 01:06:05.760]   Companies get beholden to a certain way of making money.
[01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:09.080]   I think that's always the issue.
[01:06:09.080 --> 01:06:10.600]   We talked about Amazon.
[01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:15.160]   Amazon's business is to make money by selling us things.
[01:06:15.160 --> 01:06:20.320]   Anything they do around it is part of growing their core business.
[01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:24.520]   That's the first thing they think about is, "This is our business, and this is what we
[01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:26.440]   need to do to protect it."
[01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:31.960]   Apple's business is hardware and great user interface experiences for their customers,
[01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:33.760]   so they think along those lines.
[01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:38.760]   Google's business is search and basically search-based advertising, and they always
[01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:40.080]   think from that lens.
[01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:44.160]   I think everything they do is influenced by their DNA.
[01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:48.040]   I think that is an issue which keeps showing up.
[01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:54.240]   If you really peel the onion on Amazon and their API play, is that they were, at that
[01:06:54.240 --> 01:06:59.040]   point, they were saying, "Okay, if this is an API, they need to get various different
[01:06:59.040 --> 01:07:03.360]   parts of the Amazon, the company, talking to each other."
[01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:09.760]   Similarly, they will have partners, whether they're Target or other booksellers or jewelry
[01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:15.760]   sellers, talking to their system in order to go sell things through the Amazon platform.
[01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:20.320]   I think that was part of a conscious thinking process.
[01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:25.160]   That's an issue Google has, and they need to figure this one out.
[01:07:25.160 --> 01:07:29.080]   I think Google has two things going for it.
[01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:35.960]   One is they still are dominant in search, so they need to think about search not in
[01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:39.560]   the context of a search box and 10 blue links.
[01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:42.680]   They need to think of search like how different it can be.
[01:07:42.680 --> 01:07:46.120]   I'm pretty sure they're doing a lot of work on that.
[01:07:46.120 --> 01:07:48.240]   It's a smart group of people.
[01:07:48.240 --> 01:07:49.520]   There are other big advantages.
[01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:51.360]   They know how to use scale.
[01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:56.760]   They need to use scale or the infrastructure scale to their advantage.
[01:07:56.760 --> 01:08:00.940]   The APIs may not be the way to think about it right now.
[01:08:00.940 --> 01:08:05.760]   They should be thinking about how do we build platforms which are massive for other people
[01:08:05.760 --> 01:08:06.840]   to innovate on.
[01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:10.120]   I think that's how I see it.
[01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:15.840]   Google should see itself as a platform company.
[01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:16.840]   I am really surprised.
[01:08:16.840 --> 01:08:19.520]   This is by the way where Microsoft has a huge advantage.
[01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:22.240]   It was a platform company from day one.
[01:08:22.240 --> 01:08:24.840]   That's what they did.
[01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:29.560]   When I worked there, I was surprised that they let Amazon build a platform without answering
[01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:30.560]   it.
[01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:34.320]   That's what Yeggy says in fact is that Microsoft had that advantage but kind of dithered it
[01:08:34.320 --> 01:08:35.320]   away.
[01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:36.320]   Google never was a platform company.
[01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:38.720]   Do you think it's too late to become a...
[01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:39.720]   How do they do that?
[01:08:39.720 --> 01:08:41.320]   You said that you hit the nail on the head.
[01:08:41.320 --> 01:08:44.040]   Companies get attached to their business model.
[01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:46.320]   It's very difficult to make that change.
[01:08:46.320 --> 01:08:48.240]   I don't think that with Google Plus...
[01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:49.880]   By the way, I should point out that Google announced...
[01:08:49.880 --> 01:08:51.640]   Why does everybody have to be a platform company?
[01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:57.920]   Google did announce $9.7 billion in revenue for the quarter, $2.73 billion income for
[01:08:57.920 --> 01:08:59.920]   the quarter, almost a billion a month.
[01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:00.920]   Why does it need to be a platform?
[01:09:00.920 --> 01:09:04.560]   Why does everybody have to do the same thing?
[01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:06.440]   What we're talking about is future, not present.
[01:09:06.440 --> 01:09:09.960]   Why does it have to be a platform in the future?
[01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:12.720]   Here's where I think things are going to get interesting.
[01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:16.760]   Facebook is building a new media company where the media comes to you.
[01:09:16.760 --> 01:09:21.120]   Google is scared by that because if people start going over to Facebook and just hanging
[01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:22.120]   out on Facebook...
[01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:24.680]   They'll be searching on Facebook too.
[01:09:24.680 --> 01:09:25.760]   That's it.
[01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:28.920]   These two companies are intense satisfaction machines.
[01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:31.360]   You want sushi tonight in Petaluma, you go to Google.
[01:09:31.360 --> 01:09:32.880]   The old way was Google, you know, sushi...
[01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:34.600]   The new way is go to Siri.
[01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:37.200]   Well the new way is really to go to Facebook and ask your friends.
[01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:39.280]   No, you're spending too much time with me.
[01:09:39.280 --> 01:09:40.280]   Give me my phone.
[01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:41.280]   No, no, no.
[01:09:41.280 --> 01:09:42.280]   Siri, come back.
[01:09:42.280 --> 01:09:45.800]   I think it would be nice if I could say, "Siri, come to Papa."
[01:09:45.800 --> 01:09:46.800]   And it just creeps over.
[01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:48.760]   Yeah, that would be creepy.
[01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:50.720]   I want feet on my next iPhone.
[01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:54.960]   But Facebook is the new way of satisfying intent.
[01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:59.800]   You ask your friends and you ask their friends and you ask the crowd, right?
[01:09:59.800 --> 01:10:04.360]   Google is you ask an algorithm, you get a list.
[01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:06.800]   Where is this going in the future?
[01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:08.680]   That's why I'm betting so much on Google+.
[01:10:08.680 --> 01:10:13.440]   I think that Google+ is interesting because they could come in the back door on social
[01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:17.640]   and gather the... grab the interest graph, which Facebook does not have.
[01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:21.000]   I'm wondering if Google+ has missed its moment.
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:22.000]   They're still growing.
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:23.000]   They've missed it if you compare it to Facebook.
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:26.320]   40 million users according to Larry Page.
[01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:28.800]   They missed it if you want to compare it to Facebook.
[01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:29.800]   No women.
[01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:30.800]   No women.
[01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:32.560]   Facebook is for friends and family, right?
[01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:35.360]   That's where we put friends and family photos.
[01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:36.360]   They missed it.
[01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:37.360]   They're not going to get that back.
[01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:41.840]   But if they redefine the goalposts, if they say the goalposts are now who is going to
[01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:45.400]   own the interest graph, Google has a lot of advantages there.
[01:10:45.400 --> 01:10:49.320]   Facebook doesn't have a search engine and they don't have a thing that's at the top
[01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:51.640]   of every damn browser called the search box.
[01:10:51.640 --> 01:10:53.640]   When are we going to see the timeline roll out, by the way?
[01:10:53.640 --> 01:10:54.640]   I just love this.
[01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:55.640]   I don't know.
[01:10:55.640 --> 01:10:56.640]   You have it.
[01:10:56.640 --> 01:10:57.640]   I have it.
[01:10:57.640 --> 01:10:58.640]   Do you have your timeline on?
[01:10:58.640 --> 01:10:59.640]   No, I refuse to do that.
[01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:00.640]   Those things are annoying.
[01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:01.640]   It's like an ego trip.
[01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:02.640]   It's totally an ego trip.
[01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:07.000]   Look, I've got on the bottom, I've got my baby pictures.
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:12.160]   The only thing I don't like about it is that I continually get some guy's butt in the ad
[01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:13.160]   here.
[01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:14.160]   I see that.
[01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:15.160]   Every time.
[01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:18.720]   It's like they think I want pants that make my butt look good, apparently.
[01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:19.720]   I don't have the butt ad.
[01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:20.720]   I'm the only guy.
[01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:21.720]   I have a watch and a...
[01:11:21.720 --> 01:11:24.720]   Can I vote this ad down?
[01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:26.680]   I have a "want to grow your site" ad.
[01:11:26.680 --> 01:11:28.480]   Maybe they think I don't have enough users or something.
[01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:32.560]   I think this is so much fun because I just...of course, it is a vanity thing because I'm the
[01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:34.120]   only one who ever looks at my timeline.
[01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:35.560]   No, I look at yours, too.
[01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:36.560]   It's a history.
[01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:37.560]   You and Scoble.
[01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:38.560]   It's a history.
[01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:39.920]   Don't you know that I have stalking you?
[01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:43.320]   Well, it is the ideal stalker tool, isn't it?
[01:11:43.320 --> 01:11:45.360]   I just think it's really fun.
[01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:46.880]   That's how I know who was on last week's show.
[01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:47.880]   Why would this be fun?
[01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:48.880]   Technically fun.
[01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:49.880]   It's not fun?
[01:11:49.880 --> 01:11:50.880]   No.
[01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:51.880]   You don't find this fun?
[01:11:51.880 --> 01:11:52.880]   Nah.
[01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:53.880]   Time killer.
[01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:55.440]   He likes fishing on the dock.
[01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:59.120]   Yeah, give me a fishing pole.
[01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:01.480]   Here's us building the studio.
[01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:06.240]   My only regret is that I haven't been using Facebook since I was born because then I'd
[01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:09.320]   have all that other stuff, but I am slowly adding stuff.
[01:12:09.320 --> 01:12:10.960]   In fact, you know what?
[01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:14.240]   Google is slowly adding stuff because there's more stuff here than there was.
[01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:15.240]   Look, you've got your baby pictures.
[01:12:15.240 --> 01:12:16.240]   No, no.
[01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:20.800]   That's my wife's cousin's baby photo.
[01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:22.520]   You can go through and put that in there.
[01:12:22.520 --> 01:12:25.840]   You know you can put in when you broke your arm or they have all sorts of events.
[01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:26.840]   There's an interface.
[01:12:26.840 --> 01:12:28.760]   Yeah, the government loves this information.
[01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:29.760]   That's the question.
[01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:30.760]   They've all had it already.
[01:12:30.760 --> 01:12:33.600]   So this is the question.
[01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:36.640]   This is pretty appealing to some people.
[01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:38.720]   Look, I got my baby picture.
[01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:40.440]   Is that you as a baby?
[01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:41.920]   Yeah, that's me and my dad.
[01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:46.040]   Why do you want that picture on the internet?
[01:12:46.040 --> 01:12:47.040]   I don't know.
[01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:48.040]   Why not?
[01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:52.320]   Don't you like it?
[01:12:52.320 --> 01:12:57.760]   It's better here than in the shoe box it was in the garage.
[01:12:57.760 --> 01:12:59.760]   Actually you ask a really good question, Johnson.
[01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:01.360]   Let me actually give you some...
[01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:06.220]   Wait, before I give it to you, I have to say something to respond to Scobles.
[01:13:06.220 --> 01:13:09.040]   You could scan these things in and keep them on a hard disk someplace if you want to give
[01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:12.480]   them to your kids or something, but I don't see why the public needs to be seeing baby
[01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:13.480]   pictures.
[01:13:13.480 --> 01:13:14.880]   I have 10 terabytes of hard drive.
[01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:18.600]   You think my kids are ever going to go through that stuff looking for their dad's baby picture?
[01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:22.760]   No, you put it online just because you figure no one's ever going to look, nobody gives
[01:13:22.760 --> 01:13:23.760]   a crap.
[01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:25.840]   So let's put it online.
[01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:29.040]   Maybe somebody will see my pictures.
[01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:32.120]   It's how your life now is shared.
[01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:33.920]   We're public people now.
[01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:34.920]   But everybody is.
[01:13:34.920 --> 01:13:37.520]   Now keep in mind, this has privacy.
[01:13:37.520 --> 01:13:38.840]   You can share it with just your family.
[01:13:38.840 --> 01:13:40.680]   It's got very granular privacy.
[01:13:40.680 --> 01:13:43.800]   You can take each of these and say, "No, no, I don't want anybody to see that."
[01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:48.880]   Well, you know, you're the one that had the stalker, the one here at the table who's had
[01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:49.880]   that experience.
[01:13:49.880 --> 01:13:50.880]   Oh yeah, that's right.
[01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:51.880]   I stalk him every day.
[01:13:51.880 --> 01:13:52.880]   What are you talking about?
[01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:53.880]   No, I mean a real stalker.
[01:13:53.880 --> 01:13:58.280]   I actually found out where Leo was having dinner with his family on Foursquare.
[01:13:58.280 --> 01:14:02.640]   Somebody once asked me, "Don't you worry that checking in on Foursquare will let people
[01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:04.200]   know where you are and they'll bug you?"
[01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:07.080]   And I said, "The only time that's ever happened has only happened once and it was Scoble."
[01:14:07.080 --> 01:14:08.080]   Scoble's a terrorist.
[01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:09.080]   And it was like, "How did you know?"
[01:14:09.080 --> 01:14:10.080]   He said, "Foursquare."
[01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:18.640]   By the way, it knows that I listened to the Peter Gunn theme like eight times while we
[01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:20.920]   were waiting for you to drive up on Glimpse.
[01:14:20.920 --> 01:14:21.920]   Excellent.
[01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:22.920]   Isn't that interesting?
[01:14:22.920 --> 01:14:23.920]   Yeah, that's fascinating.
[01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:24.920]   Thank you, John.
[01:14:24.920 --> 01:14:25.920]   If I...
[01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:26.920]   Yeah, home?
[01:14:26.920 --> 01:14:32.440]   No, I just said thank you, John, for bringing that up.
[01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:36.880]   I'm just listening to this love fest over Facebook and I'm like, "Really?"
[01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:38.480]   You don't like it, home?
[01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:39.480]   I don't know, man.
[01:14:39.480 --> 01:14:43.160]   I mean, sometimes too much is just too much.
[01:14:43.160 --> 01:14:44.680]   I think that's what is...
[01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:51.520]   It's nice to kind of talk to people on the net, exchange a few things, some pictures,
[01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:56.840]   birthday wishes and stuff like that, but I think it's just getting a little creepy.
[01:14:56.840 --> 01:14:57.840]   It seems like it's been delayed.
[01:14:57.840 --> 01:14:59.920]   I don't know if that's because of lawsuits or...
[01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:04.200]   I know there was an issue with the word timeline, but for some reason it seems to be...
[01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:05.480]   I thought it would be out by now.
[01:15:05.480 --> 01:15:10.440]   I think they're watching the reactions and letting it spread slowly.
[01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:12.000]   People who want to be on it can get on it.
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:13.000]   Yeah, you have to create a developer account.
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:14.000]   Just go to Google.
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:15.000]   It's four steps.
[01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:16.000]   It's really easy.
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:17.000]   How do I get a timeline?
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:18.000]   If I can do it, anybody can do it.
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:22.160]   My wife did it, by the way, which really shocked the hell out of me.
[01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:23.680]   You can't see...
[01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:28.240]   If you want to see Robert or my timeline, you have to have your own timeline first or
[01:15:28.240 --> 01:15:29.240]   you won't be able...
[01:15:29.240 --> 01:15:32.440]   It will just look like our regular Facebook page.
[01:15:32.440 --> 01:15:33.440]   I don't know.
[01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:34.560]   I think it's...
[01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:38.000]   One thing though, there was a new Foursquare that got released this week.
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:39.800]   Foursquare has changed its model a little bit.
[01:15:39.800 --> 01:15:42.200]   Gowala completely changed its model, giving up...
[01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:44.160]   I have 2,000 check-ins.
[01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:45.320]   What's really neat now with this...
[01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:46.320]   So do I.
[01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:47.320]   Do you?
[01:15:47.320 --> 01:15:48.320]   I just crossed 2,000.
[01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:49.320]   Wow.
[01:15:49.320 --> 01:15:52.960]   What's really neat is this new explore feature that shows you all sorts of cool things to
[01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:55.800]   do near you that other people have checked into.
[01:15:55.800 --> 01:15:56.800]   It's really fascinating.
[01:15:56.800 --> 01:16:01.560]   It will now notify you when you're near a great restaurant, for instance, to say, "This is
[01:16:01.560 --> 01:16:04.640]   on your list to do," or "This is what friends have said is a good restaurant."
[01:16:04.640 --> 01:16:05.640]   Now I just want to...
[01:16:05.640 --> 01:16:06.640]   That's a good business model.
[01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:07.640]   Is it something you want?
[01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:08.640]   Absolutely.
[01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:09.640]   I just want to stalk you, man.
[01:16:09.640 --> 01:16:12.080]   I don't know about these great restaurant things.
[01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:14.040]   Do you use Foursquare at all?
[01:16:14.040 --> 01:16:16.120]   I use it a lot, but it's very private.
[01:16:16.120 --> 01:16:18.120]   I don't use it with a lot of people.
[01:16:18.120 --> 01:16:19.840]   So you stalk us, but we don't...
[01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:20.840]   No, I'm following.
[01:16:20.840 --> 01:16:21.840]   Om and I are Facebook...
[01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:22.840]   I mean, Foursquare buddies.
[01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:23.840]   Foursquare friends.
[01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:32.080]   I think one thing I wanted to bring up to you about Facebook that now Facebook is doing
[01:16:32.080 --> 01:16:38.600]   geo-fenced friend suggestions with absolutely no mutual connections.
[01:16:38.600 --> 01:16:39.760]   What does that mean?
[01:16:39.760 --> 01:16:43.480]   What that means is people who are basically around you.
[01:16:43.480 --> 01:16:44.480]   Really?
[01:16:44.480 --> 01:16:45.480]   Yeah.
[01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:47.600]   So Foursquare does that too.
[01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:50.920]   It says that there's somebody who's around you, you might like.
[01:16:50.920 --> 01:16:51.920]   Oh, you know what?
[01:16:51.920 --> 01:16:52.920]   You're right.
[01:16:52.920 --> 01:16:55.640]   I have a list of people who are in Haffman Bay.
[01:16:55.640 --> 01:16:56.960]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:16:56.960 --> 01:17:01.680]   If you go over here, it suggests other people who are in Haffman Bay or nearby.
[01:17:01.680 --> 01:17:05.800]   The suggestions aren't always accurate though, and it's only an area.
[01:17:05.800 --> 01:17:09.040]   It doesn't show you that they're down in the street from you.
[01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:10.040]   Right.
[01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:12.400]   Yeah, but it is pretty...
[01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:18.680]   It's getting a little bit more closer to home, so if that's exactly the phrase I've been
[01:17:18.680 --> 01:17:20.240]   looking for.
[01:17:20.240 --> 01:17:24.480]   It's a little scary from my perspective.
[01:17:24.480 --> 01:17:25.480]   Okay.
[01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:27.480]   It's not to me.
[01:17:27.480 --> 01:17:31.440]   I found a lot of people I knew in my area, and I added them, and now I have a list of
[01:17:31.440 --> 01:17:32.880]   everybody in my area.
[01:17:32.880 --> 01:17:34.080]   By the way, why is Chris putting on one?
[01:17:34.080 --> 01:17:37.760]   I'm going to have to cop to it that it is an ego thing.
[01:17:37.760 --> 01:17:38.760]   I've been thinking about it.
[01:17:38.760 --> 01:17:40.080]   You've been dwelling on this since I said...
[01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:41.160]   Yeah, because you asked the question.
[01:17:41.160 --> 01:17:45.640]   I want to give you the honor of actually thinking about it, and I think it makes you feel good
[01:17:45.640 --> 01:17:47.600]   about yourself to make this timeline.
[01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:51.600]   I think you might make some rationalizations that, "Oh, it'll be for others," or, "My
[01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:56.640]   kids will look at it," but really, it is all about me looking at my history in a kind of
[01:17:56.640 --> 01:17:58.440]   attractive way.
[01:17:58.440 --> 01:18:01.720]   It's kind of like looking at old photo albums, which is pleasant, isn't it?
[01:18:01.720 --> 01:18:04.120]   Yeah, everybody likes looking at old photos.
[01:18:04.120 --> 01:18:05.120]   It's kind of like that.
[01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:06.680]   It's just a digital way of doing that.
[01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:10.360]   What I think is interesting is that Facebook is getting better and better at keeping this
[01:18:10.360 --> 01:18:11.360]   sticky.
[01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:12.880]   We've talked a little bit about this.
[01:18:12.880 --> 01:18:18.800]   It really means that you can live, and I think many people do, in Facebook all day.
[01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:20.560]   Once we start pulling in TV shows...
[01:18:20.560 --> 01:18:22.400]   I'm sure there's a whole...
[01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:24.880]   Walking Dead just came on the East Coast.
[01:18:24.880 --> 01:18:28.720]   I'm sure there are a lot of people who are watching the Walking Dead premiere.
[01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:31.640]   Probably Eileen's doing it right now.
[01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:32.640]   Are you watching it?
[01:18:32.640 --> 01:18:33.640]   Yes, I am.
[01:18:33.640 --> 01:18:34.640]   Are you actually watching it?
[01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:35.640]   No.
[01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:36.640]   All right.
[01:18:36.640 --> 01:18:37.640]   It's killing you, though, isn't it, that you're here instead of watching it?
[01:18:37.640 --> 01:18:38.640]   Slightly, yeah.
[01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:39.640]   I'd rather be home.
[01:18:39.640 --> 01:18:40.640]   Here's an example, by the way.
[01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:42.640]   What are those zombies going to eat next?
[01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:45.160]   Here's an example of what I mean by it's a media company.
[01:18:45.160 --> 01:18:48.760]   I clicked "like" on the San Francisco 49ers because I like the 49ers.
[01:18:48.760 --> 01:18:53.880]   Here on my ticker, it brought San Francisco 49ers highlights from the 25-19 victory over
[01:18:53.880 --> 01:18:55.360]   the Lions.
[01:18:55.360 --> 01:19:02.440]   How long before we're watching the game with our friends in Facebook?
[01:19:02.440 --> 01:19:04.920]   I think that's just a matter of time.
[01:19:04.920 --> 01:19:07.960]   Help your friends discover great places to visit by writing a recommendation for San
[01:19:07.960 --> 01:19:10.360]   Francisco 49ers.
[01:19:10.360 --> 01:19:11.360]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:12.360]   How does that work?
[01:19:12.360 --> 01:19:13.360]   What's the recommendation?
[01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:14.360]   Well, they're thinking of it as a brand or a restaurant.
[01:19:14.360 --> 01:19:15.360]   I like this team.
[01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:16.360]   I mean, what does that mean?
[01:19:16.360 --> 01:19:17.360]   Yeah, so there you go.
[01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:19.440]   I can't even figure that out.
[01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:21.280]   Do you use any of the frictionless sharing stuff?
[01:19:21.280 --> 01:19:22.280]   I do.
[01:19:22.280 --> 01:19:23.280]   I've got it all turned on.
[01:19:23.280 --> 01:19:25.040]   You saw that Spotify.
[01:19:25.040 --> 01:19:27.320]   That happened automatically.
[01:19:27.320 --> 01:19:30.720]   The problem is it seems to happen without even anybody saying yes to it.
[01:19:30.720 --> 01:19:34.120]   It just kind of seems to all of a sudden.
[01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:41.160]   One of my coworkers was shocked to know that all of a sudden, a couple of days ago, her
[01:19:41.160 --> 01:19:43.560]   location was being shared by Foursquare.
[01:19:43.560 --> 01:19:44.560]   She swears.
[01:19:44.560 --> 01:19:45.560]   I don't remember turning this on.
[01:19:45.560 --> 01:19:46.560]   I don't remember.
[01:19:46.560 --> 01:19:49.240]   I said, "Did you ever go to Foursquare and say, 'Look up my Facebook friends?'"
[01:19:49.240 --> 01:19:50.240]   And she said, "Yeah."
[01:19:50.240 --> 01:19:51.600]   I said, "You turned it on.
[01:19:51.600 --> 01:19:52.600]   You just didn't know it."
[01:19:52.600 --> 01:19:54.320]   And that's what I really fear.
[01:19:54.320 --> 01:19:59.040]   And there's some real danger to that if you're a young woman and you're putting your location
[01:19:59.040 --> 01:20:01.080]   in public all the time.
[01:20:01.080 --> 01:20:02.080]   That's dangerous.
[01:20:02.080 --> 01:20:04.160]   Check in when you're leaving the restaurant, not when you get there.
[01:20:04.160 --> 01:20:07.960]   I think we're going to ... It's a shame we have to do that.
[01:20:07.960 --> 01:20:13.840]   That's exactly my point is that these guys don't talk about the privacy and all these
[01:20:13.840 --> 01:20:16.040]   privacy controls in plain English.
[01:20:16.040 --> 01:20:20.200]   They make it in the name of making it easy.
[01:20:20.200 --> 01:20:22.520]   They are actually cutting corners.
[01:20:22.520 --> 01:20:25.760]   And that's not ... We can't condone that.
[01:20:25.760 --> 01:20:27.880]   I think that's a big issue.
[01:20:27.880 --> 01:20:29.720]   They need to be held accountable for that.
[01:20:29.720 --> 01:20:36.320]   I think the fact that we will be sharing more and more of our lives online is a given by
[01:20:36.320 --> 01:20:37.320]   now.
[01:20:37.320 --> 01:20:40.680]   We need to be told in pretty simple way.
[01:20:40.680 --> 01:20:46.780]   And I think we need, as people who are interested in tech, and every average person needs to
[01:20:46.780 --> 01:20:50.920]   hold these companies' feet to the fire when it comes to ...
[01:20:50.920 --> 01:20:51.920]   Exactly.
[01:20:51.920 --> 01:21:02.120]   I mean, it's not about being scared or having ... Just getting violent reactions to it,
[01:21:02.120 --> 01:21:07.520]   or just saying, "This is what we, the people, want," and then the companies have to do it,
[01:21:07.520 --> 01:21:11.840]   and the people who don't do it, we need to hold them accountable.
[01:21:11.840 --> 01:21:13.880]   I completely agree with you.
[01:21:13.880 --> 01:21:14.880]   There's no way to control it.
[01:21:14.880 --> 01:21:20.200]   For instance, I just read a couple of Washington Post articles, and so did Leo.
[01:21:20.200 --> 01:21:22.040]   It's telling you that I read it?
[01:21:22.040 --> 01:21:23.360]   We didn't read them, right?
[01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:28.320]   I would love to set the time at which it frictionally shares that.
[01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:29.320]   I didn't even read it.
[01:21:29.320 --> 01:21:31.360]   I just opened it for a couple seconds and then closed it again.
[01:21:31.360 --> 01:21:32.360]   Was that really reading it?
[01:21:32.360 --> 01:21:36.040]   Well, it would be in a court of law, I bet, if you were sued because you were supposed
[01:21:36.040 --> 01:21:39.400]   to know something about something and you were liable, and then the next thing you know,
[01:21:39.400 --> 01:21:43.040]   you were ... They said, "You did read this, Mr. Scoble.
[01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:44.040]   You knew about this."
[01:21:44.040 --> 01:21:45.040]   We have it here on Facebook.
[01:21:45.040 --> 01:21:46.040]   Probably.
[01:21:46.040 --> 01:21:50.520]   And if you listen to music on Spotify, as soon as it starts playing, it shares it with
[01:21:50.520 --> 01:21:54.560]   all your friends, which doesn't mean I really listen to that song.
[01:21:54.560 --> 01:21:58.520]   I'd rather change it so that it does that two-thirds of the way through the song.
[01:21:58.520 --> 01:21:59.520]   That's a finesse.
[01:21:59.520 --> 01:22:05.320]   Well, let's address this larger issue of ... I think people are, in fact, turning this stuff
[01:22:05.320 --> 01:22:06.320]   on.
[01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:09.760]   I think that the ego appeal of this makes you do it.
[01:22:09.760 --> 01:22:14.600]   It feels good without much consideration for the consequences.
[01:22:14.600 --> 01:22:15.600]   So I agree with you, Omid.
[01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:20.120]   I think this is something that Facebook really got to tell people and be very clear about.
[01:22:20.120 --> 01:22:23.280]   It's not in their interest to do so, and I don't think they will do so unless they're
[01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:26.480]   forced to do so by government.
[01:22:26.480 --> 01:22:30.880]   And yet, I also want to point out things like Occupy Wall Street, which is using Twitter,
[01:22:30.880 --> 01:22:33.080]   Facebook, and other social media.
[01:22:33.080 --> 01:22:34.080]   Barely.
[01:22:34.080 --> 01:22:35.080]   Barely.
[01:22:35.080 --> 01:22:40.280]   I have ... My son has friends at the Occupy Wall Street event, and he says he's shocked
[01:22:40.280 --> 01:22:42.200]   how little they use it.
[01:22:42.200 --> 01:22:43.200]   They don't ...
[01:22:43.200 --> 01:22:44.200]   Well, it's because they're a bunch of hippies.
[01:22:44.200 --> 01:22:49.240]   I don't know about that, but they're not trained the way they were by the Hillary Clinton group
[01:22:49.240 --> 01:22:51.360]   and the technologists that they ...
[01:22:51.360 --> 01:22:52.360]   I think the same thing happened.
[01:22:52.360 --> 01:22:53.360]   They don't answer the phone.
[01:22:53.360 --> 01:22:58.480]   I think the same thing happened in the early spring.
[01:22:58.480 --> 01:22:59.480]   There was a handful of people.
[01:22:59.480 --> 01:23:02.320]   Dave Weiner and I hung out in New York this week, and he says they're using Facebook all
[01:23:02.320 --> 01:23:03.320]   over.
[01:23:03.320 --> 01:23:06.480]   They don't have the spreadsheets showing where the cops are like they do in England.
[01:23:06.480 --> 01:23:07.920]   They don't have the anti-Kiddling stuff.
[01:23:07.920 --> 01:23:08.920]   Oh, all right.
[01:23:08.920 --> 01:23:09.920]   We'll get better at it.
[01:23:09.920 --> 01:23:11.280]   They do all the stuff that everybody else does.
[01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:13.160]   This is a naive group.
[01:23:13.160 --> 01:23:17.120]   One night over one weekend coming up, the cops are going to go in and clear them out, and
[01:23:17.120 --> 01:23:18.120]   it's going to be ...
[01:23:18.120 --> 01:23:19.120]   They tried this morning.
[01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:20.120]   Well ...
[01:23:20.120 --> 01:23:21.400]   Let me put it this way, though.
[01:23:21.400 --> 01:23:25.400]   Whether they're using it or not, most of my news about Occupy Wall Street, certainly in
[01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:27.480]   the beginning, came from social media.
[01:23:27.480 --> 01:23:30.360]   It didn't come from mainstream media.
[01:23:30.360 --> 01:23:34.000]   That's when you start to see, when you start seeing all these tweets, all this activity,
[01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.760]   Google Plus going crazy, Facebook going crazy.
[01:23:36.760 --> 01:23:39.080]   That's when you realize there's something going on, and I think it's very much like
[01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:41.120]   the Arab Spring, that these are potentially powerful tools.
[01:23:41.120 --> 01:23:45.200]   I think they should get drones over the thing.
[01:23:45.200 --> 01:23:46.520]   They should bring in the troops.
[01:23:46.520 --> 01:23:51.320]   We need troops on the ground, and we need to overthrow the evil leaders.
[01:23:51.320 --> 01:23:57.280]   Isn't it true, Mr. John C. Dvorak, that on October 16th, 2011, you announced that the
[01:23:57.280 --> 01:23:58.720]   government should be overthrown?
[01:23:58.720 --> 01:23:59.720]   No.
[01:23:59.720 --> 01:24:01.600]   I believe I have that on record.
[01:24:01.600 --> 01:24:03.440]   It says here on your Facebook page.
[01:24:03.440 --> 01:24:04.440]   By the way ...
[01:24:04.440 --> 01:24:05.440]   I don't have a Facebook page.
[01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:06.440]   Aha!
[01:24:06.440 --> 01:24:07.440]   All right.
[01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:08.440]   I'm sorry.
[01:24:08.440 --> 01:24:12.520]   By the way, Google Plus does have a search for ...
[01:24:12.520 --> 01:24:15.960]   Oh, that's another thing they added this week with the hashtags, and that's the first thing
[01:24:15.960 --> 01:24:16.960]   I ...
[01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:20.600]   The problem is, my posts are at the top, and they don't deserve to be, just because they
[01:24:20.600 --> 01:24:21.600]   are not there.
[01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:22.600]   You're not there?
[01:24:22.600 --> 01:24:23.600]   No, because I'm a ... No, I was there.
[01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:24.600]   Oh, you were in New York.
[01:24:24.600 --> 01:24:25.600]   I took pictures.
[01:24:25.600 --> 01:24:26.600]   I went there.
[01:24:26.600 --> 01:24:29.400]   But the most popular thing doesn't deserve to be, so let's look at most recent.
[01:24:29.400 --> 01:24:30.400]   They haven't been very good.
[01:24:30.400 --> 01:24:31.880]   They don't have that algorithm down.
[01:24:31.880 --> 01:24:33.280]   Now, see, not in my case.
[01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:39.200]   I have best of, and Greg Kanale, Occupy Wall Street at Times Square is number one on mine.
[01:24:39.200 --> 01:24:44.640]   Then you ... But I think this is ... Probably it's based on a number of pluses and comments,
[01:24:44.640 --> 01:24:45.640]   right?
[01:24:45.640 --> 01:24:46.640]   Yeah.
[01:24:46.640 --> 01:24:47.640]   Yeah.
[01:24:47.640 --> 01:24:50.040]   So, because you have a lot of engagement on your stream, whether in fact you're authoritative
[01:24:50.040 --> 01:24:54.880]   on a subject, you're going to appear as best of merely because you've got the engagement.
[01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:59.040]   Nevertheless, I think if you look at this stream, this is fascinating.
[01:24:59.040 --> 01:25:02.040]   This is how we are finding out about this.
[01:25:02.040 --> 01:25:05.560]   This is not merely how it's being organized, but how it's being ... How the word is being
[01:25:05.560 --> 01:25:06.560]   spread.
[01:25:06.560 --> 01:25:07.560]   You don't know how much of the material is being planted.
[01:25:07.560 --> 01:25:08.560]   I plant it all mine.
[01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:11.560]   And he's probably planting stuff.
[01:25:11.560 --> 01:25:14.880]   So, are you worried, John, that it could be used for it to manipulate as well?
[01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:15.880]   Oh, it can be.
[01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:18.960]   I think it is being used to manipulate, and I think he can't trust it.
[01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:22.480]   Well, so I should trust the New York Times?
[01:25:22.480 --> 01:25:23.480]   Better than this.
[01:25:23.480 --> 01:25:24.480]   Okay, that's interesting.
[01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:28.080]   So, I think that's a legitimate point, is that ...
[01:25:28.080 --> 01:25:32.680]   Although you have to remember the New York Times buried the story for two weeks before.
[01:25:32.680 --> 01:25:36.000]   But they've ... Now that they're caught up to the story, they're on it.
[01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:39.680]   But you have to deal with the fact that the New York Times does that sort of thing.
[01:25:39.680 --> 01:25:41.360]   But at least you know that.
[01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:44.240]   You have no idea what's going on with this stuff.
[01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:46.760]   Well, that's interesting.
[01:25:46.760 --> 01:25:47.880]   Can we learn how to vet it?
[01:25:47.880 --> 01:25:50.480]   Can we ... Well, first of all, I know people who are
[01:25:50.480 --> 01:25:52.600]   on the ground who are on Google+ or on Twitter or on Facebook.
[01:25:52.600 --> 01:25:55.640]   That you have individuals that you've personally vetted.
[01:25:55.640 --> 01:25:56.640]   And I think that's fine.
[01:25:56.640 --> 01:25:59.280]   You can trust someone that you know that's doing this.
[01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:01.280]   But half of these people, you don't know who they are.
[01:26:01.280 --> 01:26:03.040]   That's why we rely on curators.
[01:26:03.040 --> 01:26:05.680]   Like, who's the NPR guy who's doing this?
[01:26:05.680 --> 01:26:06.680]   And I'm not even into the story.
[01:26:06.680 --> 01:26:08.280]   That guy, it can't be trusted.
[01:26:08.280 --> 01:26:09.280]   Carvin?
[01:26:09.280 --> 01:26:10.280]   Carvin, Andy Carvin.
[01:26:10.280 --> 01:26:11.280]   He's the worst.
[01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:12.280]   Really?
[01:26:12.280 --> 01:26:16.480]   Oh, he avoids talking about ... He's got an agenda that is so obvious it's ridiculous.
[01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:17.480]   That's interesting.
[01:26:17.480 --> 01:26:21.320]   He has been nailed for this and he has refused to discuss it.
[01:26:21.320 --> 01:26:22.320]   You have an agenda.
[01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:23.320]   Come on.
[01:26:23.320 --> 01:26:24.320]   I have no agenda.
[01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:25.320]   Oh, yeah.
[01:26:25.320 --> 01:26:26.320]   NoagendaShow.com.
[01:26:26.320 --> 01:26:27.320]   Well done.
[01:26:27.320 --> 01:26:28.320]   Bravo.
[01:26:28.320 --> 01:26:29.320]   Let's take a break.
[01:26:29.320 --> 01:26:32.320]   Your agenda is you're like an atheist who says, "I have no religion."
[01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:34.000]   Some more stories.
[01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:35.480]   Of course, the Hulu sale is off.
[01:26:35.480 --> 01:26:37.200]   Quickster is a gonester.
[01:26:37.200 --> 01:26:40.840]   Microsoft now does own Skype.
[01:26:40.840 --> 01:26:44.440]   And the Girl Scout merit badges now focus on science and technology.
[01:26:44.440 --> 01:26:45.440]   It's all ahead.
[01:26:45.440 --> 01:26:48.280]   Are you going to get your science and technology merit badge?
[01:26:48.280 --> 01:26:50.160]   I think I'm a little too old.
[01:26:50.160 --> 01:26:55.000]   First, though, let me talk ... This would be another time if you smoke them if you've
[01:26:55.000 --> 01:27:00.600]   got them, as they used to say in the service, to talk a little bit about gazelle.com.
[01:27:00.600 --> 01:27:05.120]   You know, if you've been hankering after that iPhone 4S and you say, "Oh, but I just got
[01:27:05.120 --> 01:27:08.320]   an iPhone 4," try gazelle.com.
[01:27:08.320 --> 01:27:13.480]   It is a great place to get money for your existing gadgets.
[01:27:13.480 --> 01:27:17.960]   If you've got a closet full of gadgets and you're just wondering, "What am I going to
[01:27:17.960 --> 01:27:19.440]   do with all this?"
[01:27:19.440 --> 01:27:20.440]   Don't sell it.
[01:27:20.440 --> 01:27:21.440]   Gazelle it.
[01:27:21.440 --> 01:27:22.440]   Let's see.
[01:27:22.440 --> 01:27:27.320]   If you have an iPhone 4 in great condition, you can get $222.
[01:27:27.320 --> 01:27:28.760]   Now here's the beauty of this.
[01:27:28.760 --> 01:27:29.760]   You send it to Gazelle.
[01:27:29.760 --> 01:27:30.760]   You don't even have to wipe the data.
[01:27:30.760 --> 01:27:32.800]   Their data experts will wipe the data for you.
[01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:34.500]   They will check the quality of it.
[01:27:34.500 --> 01:27:39.240]   And then they will send you a check, PayPal, a Walmart gift card, or, and this is what I
[01:27:39.240 --> 01:27:45.360]   recommend, Jeff Bezos made a deal, get the Amazon gift card, get an additional 5% from
[01:27:45.360 --> 01:27:46.360]   gazelle.
[01:27:46.360 --> 01:27:51.320]   This is a great way to sell your used gadgets quickly, easily.
[01:27:51.320 --> 01:27:58.880]   GPSs, Kindles, digital cameras, old phones, this is the place to go.
[01:27:58.880 --> 01:28:00.440]   MP3 players.
[01:28:00.440 --> 01:28:02.340]   Gazelle pays the postage.
[01:28:02.340 --> 01:28:03.520]   Gazelle gives you the money.
[01:28:03.520 --> 01:28:07.720]   And if, by the way, if it can't be recycled, if you have something sold that it can't be
[01:28:07.720 --> 01:28:14.960]   sold, they'll recycle it in a green fashion, no landfill, no overseas, no use of prison
[01:28:14.960 --> 01:28:15.960]   labor.
[01:28:15.960 --> 01:28:21.960]   They use EPA certified recyclers using ISO 9001 or 14,001 certifications.
[01:28:21.960 --> 01:28:24.280]   Cloud Blue is their primary partner today.
[01:28:24.280 --> 01:28:26.120]   They do an amazing job of recycling.
[01:28:26.120 --> 01:28:27.900]   So it's a great electronics recycler.
[01:28:27.900 --> 01:28:32.960]   You can even raise money for your charity or your cause.
[01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:34.280]   Just have a Gazelle page.
[01:28:34.280 --> 01:28:36.120]   Have a gadget drive.
[01:28:36.120 --> 01:28:37.240]   They'll set it all up for you.
[01:28:37.240 --> 01:28:38.240]   It's really great.
[01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:42.880]   G-A-Z-E-L-L-E dot com.
[01:28:42.880 --> 01:28:43.880]   Don't sell it.
[01:28:43.880 --> 01:28:50.920]   Gazelle, your used gadgets today with Gazelle and get cash or an Amazon gift card.
[01:28:50.920 --> 01:28:51.920]   We do it all the time.
[01:28:51.920 --> 01:28:56.680]   It's, you know, there's so many old gadgets lying around the Twit Brickhouse.
[01:28:56.680 --> 01:29:00.040]   I'd love to trade them in.
[01:29:00.040 --> 01:29:02.120]   Quickster is a conster.
[01:29:02.120 --> 01:29:05.640]   Boy, this was, you know, I love Reed Hastings.
[01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:07.800]   I think Netflix is brilliant.
[01:29:07.800 --> 01:29:11.000]   What the hell is going on?
[01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:16.040]   So first they announce that they're going to raise rates, basically double or 60% increase
[01:29:16.040 --> 01:29:19.100]   for people who get both DVDs and streaming.
[01:29:19.100 --> 01:29:21.600]   Then they apologize and say, "No, no, no, no, no.
[01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:22.880]   We're not going to do that.
[01:29:22.880 --> 01:29:24.960]   We're going to spin off the DVD division.
[01:29:24.960 --> 01:29:29.080]   We're going to make Quickster and then Netflix will be just streaming."
[01:29:29.080 --> 01:29:33.800]   And then this week they said, "No, we're not going to do that either."
[01:29:33.800 --> 01:29:39.640]   Is some of this whip sawing coming from the movie industry, putting the screws to Netflix?
[01:29:39.640 --> 01:29:41.840]   Because I think the world at Reed.
[01:29:41.840 --> 01:29:42.840]   Or Apple.
[01:29:42.840 --> 01:29:45.160]   You think this is coming from Apple?
[01:29:45.160 --> 01:29:46.160]   What do you know?
[01:29:46.160 --> 01:29:48.600]   They have $60 billion in the bank.
[01:29:48.600 --> 01:29:49.800]   They're going in the movie industry.
[01:29:49.800 --> 01:29:51.360]   They're working on something with TV.
[01:29:51.360 --> 01:29:54.260]   I keep hearing this rumor over and over again.
[01:29:54.260 --> 01:29:56.480]   We thought we'd see a TV this time.
[01:29:56.480 --> 01:30:02.160]   And so Apple is going to the movie guys and saying, "Sell it so that we can wipe out TV,
[01:30:02.160 --> 01:30:03.160]   wipe out movies.
[01:30:03.160 --> 01:30:05.320]   Let's go and change the world again."
[01:30:05.320 --> 01:30:10.960]   And the movie guys are smart this time because iTunes changed the music industry.
[01:30:10.960 --> 01:30:12.520]   And the rates are going up.
[01:30:12.520 --> 01:30:15.360]   And Netflix is going, "How do I deal with renewed Apple?"
[01:30:15.360 --> 01:30:21.280]   Was the original plan, Om, to deal with Quickster, "We're going to spin this off and sell it
[01:30:21.280 --> 01:30:24.560]   and then continue with streaming because that's where we're going to be able to stay in business?"
[01:30:24.560 --> 01:30:30.960]   Well, and, Om, correct me if I'm wrong, and I probably am, but they wanted to be able to
[01:30:30.960 --> 01:30:32.560]   sell off the DVD and just go out and trade.
[01:30:32.560 --> 01:30:33.560]   So what happened?
[01:30:33.560 --> 01:30:34.560]   They couldn't find a buyer.
[01:30:34.560 --> 01:30:40.360]   No, I think they wanted to spin off the business and it was actually, it's not such a crazy
[01:30:40.360 --> 01:30:41.360]   idea.
[01:30:41.360 --> 01:30:45.680]   I just, you know, the way they were going about it probably wasn't the best way to do
[01:30:45.680 --> 01:30:46.680]   it, right?
[01:30:46.680 --> 01:30:48.280]   I mean, they could have come up with a better name.
[01:30:48.280 --> 01:30:51.520]   I think Netflix as a brand is pretty dominant.
[01:30:51.520 --> 01:30:55.320]   So it was something they had to, you know, deal with.
[01:30:55.320 --> 01:31:00.720]   I think, you know, in the long run, the DVD business is going to go away and it's going
[01:31:00.720 --> 01:31:07.280]   to, you know, they were doing the right thing, just not the right way.
[01:31:07.280 --> 01:31:11.000]   You know, I'm pretty sure this is going to happen again.
[01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.640]   Not this year, maybe two years down the line.
[01:31:13.640 --> 01:31:17.080]   These guys are going to come back and, you know, spin off their DVD business.
[01:31:17.080 --> 01:31:23.240]   Scheister in the chat room nailed something, that the titles on streaming don't even, don't
[01:31:23.240 --> 01:31:25.680]   get close to matching what they do on disc.
[01:31:25.680 --> 01:31:26.680]   When I talk to a Netflix...
[01:31:26.680 --> 01:31:29.320]   Yeah, but it's only $7.99 a month, right?
[01:31:29.320 --> 01:31:30.320]   Well, that's part of it.
[01:31:30.320 --> 01:31:31.320]   The titles are pretty weak.
[01:31:31.320 --> 01:31:34.320]   No, you know, I watch Netflix streaming every night because...
[01:31:34.320 --> 01:31:35.320]   Every night?
[01:31:35.320 --> 01:31:36.320]   You don't have time to do that.
[01:31:36.320 --> 01:31:37.320]   You don't have time to do that.
[01:31:37.320 --> 01:31:38.320]   I like those 1960s movies, yeah.
[01:31:38.320 --> 01:31:41.840]   There's enough, you know, there's new stuff, there's documentaries, there's TV shows, there's
[01:31:41.840 --> 01:31:42.840]   Mad Men.
[01:31:42.840 --> 01:31:44.960]   I watch the entire Breaking Bad catcher.
[01:31:44.960 --> 01:31:48.640]   Right, but if you compare the titles to what was on DVD, it's not the same.
[01:31:48.640 --> 01:31:49.640]   It's not, you get more on DVD.
[01:31:49.640 --> 01:31:51.640]   When Netflix executives told me what...
[01:31:51.640 --> 01:31:52.720]   But whose fault is that?
[01:31:52.720 --> 01:31:54.060]   That's got to be the movie industry, right?
[01:31:54.060 --> 01:31:56.320]   They don't want to sell them those DVDs.
[01:31:56.320 --> 01:32:01.480]   No, the Netflix executives told me they did not want to get into competition with the
[01:32:01.480 --> 01:32:07.720]   people who are distributing Netflix, i.e. Apple, Xbox, Boxee, wherever you saw the Netflix
[01:32:07.720 --> 01:32:08.720]   icon.
[01:32:08.720 --> 01:32:10.920]   So they're getting pressure from the movie industry, which is saying, "We're only going
[01:32:10.920 --> 01:32:12.280]   to give you three discs.
[01:32:12.280 --> 01:32:16.280]   You can't sell it for 20... or rent it for 28 days after we start selling it."
[01:32:16.280 --> 01:32:19.200]   And they're getting pressure from all the people who have Netflix on their boxes, the
[01:32:19.200 --> 01:32:22.760]   Apple TV, the Google TV, the Boxee box.
[01:32:22.760 --> 01:32:26.600]   Why does Apple not want Netflix to be in the streaming business?
[01:32:26.600 --> 01:32:32.120]   No, they don't mind it as long as they don't compete with the $2 or $5 rental business.
[01:32:32.120 --> 01:32:37.240]   So Netflix has got to get out of the DVD business, and they can't have titles on streaming that
[01:32:37.240 --> 01:32:40.280]   compete with the premium titles on Apple and others.
[01:32:40.280 --> 01:32:41.280]   So they can't win.
[01:32:41.280 --> 01:32:42.280]   They can't win.
[01:32:42.280 --> 01:32:46.240]   You know, I think Netflix was a great idea back when the movie industry was underwriting
[01:32:46.240 --> 01:32:47.240]   those DVDs.
[01:32:47.240 --> 01:32:52.040]   They were selling Netflix DVDs cheap, in some cases for free.
[01:32:52.040 --> 01:32:55.040]   And what's happened is times have changed, and the business is pulled right out from
[01:32:55.040 --> 01:32:56.040]   under them.
[01:32:56.040 --> 01:32:58.440]   There probably is nothing they can do about it at this point, right?
[01:32:58.440 --> 01:32:59.760]   They'll be lucky to survive.
[01:32:59.760 --> 01:33:02.320]   We're waiting to see what Apple's going to do.
[01:33:02.320 --> 01:33:03.320]   This is probably...
[01:33:03.320 --> 01:33:05.400]   Is Apple going to do streaming like Netflix?
[01:33:05.400 --> 01:33:07.200]   Let's take this Christmas.
[01:33:07.200 --> 01:33:10.720]   Everybody's going to get a new iPad or this new Amazon thing, right?
[01:33:10.720 --> 01:33:12.840]   Because if John's right, everybody's going to get iPads.
[01:33:12.840 --> 01:33:16.680]   If I'm right, everybody's going to get Amazon things.
[01:33:16.680 --> 01:33:19.880]   Apple's got to announce something right into Christmas break.
[01:33:19.880 --> 01:33:20.880]   A TV?
[01:33:20.880 --> 01:33:21.880]   Yes.
[01:33:21.880 --> 01:33:22.880]   Now it's stuff to put on your iPad.
[01:33:22.880 --> 01:33:23.880]   New apps.
[01:33:23.880 --> 01:33:25.480]   New cool things to look at.
[01:33:25.480 --> 01:33:29.920]   So when you get an unbox your iPad, you know, there's not just Flipboard on there, right?
[01:33:29.920 --> 01:33:30.920]   There's other things.
[01:33:30.920 --> 01:33:32.800]   What is it?
[01:33:32.800 --> 01:33:37.480]   I'm hearing that Apple's working on something that looks like DirecTV without the dish.
[01:33:37.480 --> 01:33:40.080]   So a TV app in your lap.
[01:33:40.080 --> 01:33:41.080]   That's by the way, the one thing...
[01:33:41.080 --> 01:33:42.080]   A TV app in your lap.
[01:33:42.080 --> 01:33:43.080]   App in your lap.
[01:33:43.080 --> 01:33:44.080]   App in your lap.
[01:33:44.080 --> 01:33:45.080]   Get it.
[01:33:45.080 --> 01:33:46.080]   There's an app in your lap.
[01:33:46.080 --> 01:33:47.080]   App in your lap.com.
[01:33:47.080 --> 01:33:48.080]   Hurry up.
[01:33:48.080 --> 01:33:52.520]   I talk to cord cutters all the time and the only thing that bugs cord cutters is they
[01:33:52.520 --> 01:33:57.040]   miss sporting events, news and live events like the Oscars.
[01:33:57.040 --> 01:33:59.960]   News get Al Jazeera and that takes care of that.
[01:33:59.960 --> 01:34:01.160]   Well, yeah, okay.
[01:34:01.160 --> 01:34:03.680]   But most people are not yet watching Al Jazeera.
[01:34:03.680 --> 01:34:08.360]   And CNN, by the way, can't stream or they do, but they are very hobbled by that.
[01:34:08.360 --> 01:34:10.040]   You have to say, "I am a subscriber.
[01:34:10.040 --> 01:34:11.600]   I pay for CNN."
[01:34:11.600 --> 01:34:14.200]   Because they've got deals, draconian deals with the cable companies.
[01:34:14.200 --> 01:34:16.200]   You know this better than anybody because you were screwed.
[01:34:16.200 --> 01:34:17.200]   We couldn't do it.
[01:34:17.200 --> 01:34:18.200]   Tech TV couldn't do it.
[01:34:18.200 --> 01:34:19.200]   Exactly.
[01:34:19.200 --> 01:34:21.080]   Explain that because I remember that.
[01:34:21.080 --> 01:34:24.360]   I couldn't get Tech TV at home and I wanted to watch it.
[01:34:24.360 --> 01:34:25.360]   It baffled me.
[01:34:25.360 --> 01:34:26.360]   Most favored nations it's called.
[01:34:26.360 --> 01:34:30.320]   Yeah, when we were doing Tech TV, I kept going to them saying, "Why are we building a brick
[01:34:30.320 --> 01:34:35.120]   and mortar business, a cable based business with an audience that knows how to watch us
[01:34:35.120 --> 01:34:36.120]   on the internet?"
[01:34:36.120 --> 01:34:39.900]   And the problem is once you say we're going to be a cable channel, then you have to go
[01:34:39.900 --> 01:34:45.700]   to what they call them MSOs, the cable individual, cable regional cable guys and make deals.
[01:34:45.700 --> 01:34:50.360]   And the deals always said you may not stream more than 10 minutes of this show on the internet.
[01:34:50.360 --> 01:34:54.380]   Now they're making deals with CNN and HBO saying, "Well, you can stream, but you've got to make
[01:34:54.380 --> 01:35:00.880]   sure in your app that this customer is already paying a cable company for access."
[01:35:00.880 --> 01:35:04.240]   In other words, the cable companies are the gatekeepers.
[01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:07.780]   And that's going to stay that way until these guys go out of business, which I think is
[01:35:07.780 --> 01:35:08.780]   imminent.
[01:35:08.780 --> 01:35:09.780]   Yeah, I agree.
[01:35:09.780 --> 01:35:12.980]   But can Apple be the company that disintermediates?
[01:35:12.980 --> 01:35:17.380]   How many cable companies does Apple need to buy before the whole thing just falls apart?
[01:35:17.380 --> 01:35:18.380]   How much is Comcast?
[01:35:18.380 --> 01:35:20.480]   Because Apple's got, Google's got 42 billion.
[01:35:20.480 --> 01:35:21.480]   Ask Siri.
[01:35:21.480 --> 01:35:22.480]   Oh, how much?
[01:35:22.480 --> 01:35:23.480]   Actually, we can.
[01:35:23.480 --> 01:35:26.480]   Oh, yeah, yeah, this will be great.
[01:35:26.480 --> 01:35:30.980]   Well, if Siri doesn't know what Apple's worth, I don't know who will.
[01:35:30.980 --> 01:35:34.800]   Well you're talking about...
[01:35:34.800 --> 01:35:37.920]   What is Apple worth?
[01:35:37.920 --> 01:35:40.080]   If it says 53 cents at Rayleigh's, I'm going to...
[01:35:40.080 --> 01:35:42.080]   Comcast is $66 billion.
[01:35:42.080 --> 01:35:47.560]   The market capitalization for Apple is 391.2 billion.
[01:35:47.560 --> 01:35:48.560]   How much money do they have in the bank?
[01:35:48.560 --> 01:35:49.560]   That's the market cap.
[01:35:49.560 --> 01:35:50.560]   Yeah, that's what they're worth.
[01:35:50.560 --> 01:35:51.560]   Yeah.
[01:35:51.560 --> 01:35:52.560]   So Comcast is $66.
[01:35:52.560 --> 01:35:53.560]   Ask for Comcast.
[01:35:53.560 --> 01:35:54.560]   $66 billion?
[01:35:54.560 --> 01:35:57.440]   So, well, there's the difference right there.
[01:35:57.440 --> 01:36:00.600]   And I think Apple has close to $50 or $60 billion in the bank.
[01:36:00.600 --> 01:36:01.600]   They could almost pay cash.
[01:36:01.600 --> 01:36:02.600]   $72, I believe.
[01:36:02.600 --> 01:36:03.600]   $72?
[01:36:03.600 --> 01:36:04.600]   They could almost pay cash.
[01:36:04.600 --> 01:36:05.600]   They could pay cash.
[01:36:05.600 --> 01:36:08.720]   They do not have nothing left though.
[01:36:08.720 --> 01:36:09.720]   Just a little bit left.
[01:36:09.720 --> 01:36:10.720]   That would screw things up big time.
[01:36:10.720 --> 01:36:13.000]   Well, you know, I keep wondering...
[01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000]   It's going to be there someday.
[01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:19.160]   Someday we're going to watch on our tablets or on our, you know...
[01:36:19.160 --> 01:36:20.760]   What if Apple doesn't end around?
[01:36:20.760 --> 01:36:24.480]   What if Apple doesn't buy a cable company because that's a dying business, and instead
[01:36:24.480 --> 01:36:30.240]   goes to the local channels, goes to HBO, goes to all the content companies, makes separate
[01:36:30.240 --> 01:36:32.920]   deals with them, and creates its own company?
[01:36:32.920 --> 01:36:33.920]   What about that?
[01:36:33.920 --> 01:36:34.920]   Can they do that?
[01:36:34.920 --> 01:36:37.020]   I've heard rumors that that's what Apple's doing.
[01:36:37.020 --> 01:36:38.880]   That's what you want to do if you're Apple, right?
[01:36:38.880 --> 01:36:40.280]   Who needs a cable company?
[01:36:40.280 --> 01:36:41.880]   But this summer I was in a...
[01:36:41.880 --> 01:36:45.840]   It's more disrupting if they buy a cable company and then change the game.
[01:36:45.840 --> 01:36:47.320]   To just tear it apart.
[01:36:47.320 --> 01:36:48.320]   Yeah.
[01:36:48.320 --> 01:36:49.320]   All they need is one, really.
[01:36:49.320 --> 01:36:53.840]   Well, a charter would work that's cheaper.
[01:36:53.840 --> 01:36:55.800]   Microsoft now owns Skype.
[01:36:55.800 --> 01:36:57.720]   $8.5 billion.
[01:36:57.720 --> 01:36:59.200]   What's going to happen to Skype?
[01:36:59.200 --> 01:37:00.200]   You're on Skype right now, O'Malley.
[01:37:00.200 --> 01:37:01.200]   It's going to deteriorate.
[01:37:01.200 --> 01:37:02.200]   Is it?
[01:37:02.200 --> 01:37:03.200]   Sure.
[01:37:03.200 --> 01:37:06.480]   I hope not, even though the UI lately just...
[01:37:06.480 --> 01:37:07.480]   Terrible.
[01:37:07.480 --> 01:37:10.720]   I'm just making the UI look more like the old style.
[01:37:10.720 --> 01:37:11.720]   I've done that on my computer.
[01:37:11.720 --> 01:37:12.720]   There's a way to do it?
[01:37:12.720 --> 01:37:13.720]   Yeah, let me...
[01:37:13.720 --> 01:37:14.720]   That's all right.
[01:37:14.720 --> 01:37:15.720]   You don't have to do it now, but that's interesting.
[01:37:15.720 --> 01:37:16.720]   Do you know how to blog post?
[01:37:16.720 --> 01:37:17.720]   Yeah, blog it.
[01:37:17.720 --> 01:37:18.720]   Log it.
[01:37:18.720 --> 01:37:19.720]   On your blog, not on Google+.
[01:37:19.720 --> 01:37:20.720]   What's a blog, man?
[01:37:20.720 --> 01:37:25.040]   Google+ is so much fun.
[01:37:25.040 --> 01:37:28.040]   I am worried because our company relies somewhat on Skype.
[01:37:28.040 --> 01:37:30.640]   Most of our hosts are not geographically here.
[01:37:30.640 --> 01:37:31.640]   We have to Skype them.
[01:37:31.640 --> 01:37:32.640]   What does your Skype look like?
[01:37:32.640 --> 01:37:33.640]   Oh, it doesn't look the same.
[01:37:33.640 --> 01:37:38.800]   I'll tell you, it probably looks like the basic Skype 5 crazy UI.
[01:37:38.800 --> 01:37:41.120]   I don't know.
[01:37:41.120 --> 01:37:43.840]   Maybe I have an old Skype on here.
[01:37:43.840 --> 01:37:46.080]   That's actually looking kind of like the old one.
[01:37:46.080 --> 01:37:47.080]   Yeah.
[01:37:47.080 --> 01:37:49.240]   Yeah, that's the old Skype.
[01:37:49.240 --> 01:37:50.680]   Maybe I haven't updated this one.
[01:37:50.680 --> 01:37:52.400]   Yeah, it's old school.
[01:37:52.400 --> 01:37:53.400]   Old school.
[01:37:53.400 --> 01:37:54.720]   Then of course, as soon as I launch it, everybody wants...
[01:37:54.720 --> 01:37:56.200]   Yeah, this is version 2.8.
[01:37:56.200 --> 01:37:57.200]   That's why.
[01:37:57.200 --> 01:37:58.200]   I never...
[01:37:58.200 --> 01:37:59.240]   I had smart enough not to update it.
[01:37:59.240 --> 01:38:02.000]   I suppose we'll have to now that Microsoft owns it.
[01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:07.960]   The average Facebook post lives 22 hours and 51 minutes.
[01:38:07.960 --> 01:38:12.320]   Now, those stats came out earlier for Twitter and regular blog posts.
[01:38:12.320 --> 01:38:14.640]   In most cases, it was minutes.
[01:38:14.640 --> 01:38:18.960]   Facebook is the place if you want your stuff to live on.
[01:38:18.960 --> 01:38:20.280]   Put your stuff on Facebook.
[01:38:20.280 --> 01:38:21.280]   It means that, what?
[01:38:21.280 --> 01:38:26.200]   It continues to stay in the newsfeed for about 22 hours.
[01:38:26.200 --> 01:38:29.160]   That's a long time.
[01:38:29.160 --> 01:38:32.200]   You can actually figure out what your own post lifespan is.
[01:38:32.200 --> 01:38:34.600]   This is because Facebook has noise filtering.
[01:38:34.600 --> 01:38:37.360]   It's filtering out a lot of the crap that gets on the feed.
[01:38:37.360 --> 01:38:38.360]   Good stuff lives.
[01:38:38.360 --> 01:38:39.360]   Good stuff lives.
[01:38:39.360 --> 01:38:41.960]   I don't think it's the average.
[01:38:41.960 --> 01:38:43.520]   They say it's the average lives 22 hours.
[01:38:43.520 --> 01:38:44.520]   That's what they say, the average.
[01:38:44.520 --> 01:38:45.520]   Okay.
[01:38:45.520 --> 01:38:49.320]   Which means that some stuff lives a lot longer because a lot of stuff lives minutes.
[01:38:49.320 --> 01:38:50.320]   That's where it makes sense.
[01:38:50.320 --> 01:38:53.520]   Most people probably post to Facebook once a week, once every two weeks, something like
[01:38:53.520 --> 01:38:54.520]   that.
[01:38:54.520 --> 01:38:58.200]   If you took a thousand people, they're not like me and you where we're posting every
[01:38:58.200 --> 01:38:59.200]   20 minutes.
[01:38:59.200 --> 01:39:05.480]   Om has a good article in his GigaOM blog about what he calls it the Internet of Things.
[01:39:05.480 --> 01:39:08.320]   What is the Internet of Things?
[01:39:08.320 --> 01:39:19.000]   All these devices we have with us which are connected essentially, frames, cars, our heart
[01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:25.280]   rate monitors, our pedometers, our Wi-Fi enabled scales.
[01:39:25.280 --> 01:39:28.160]   These are all the Internet of Things.
[01:39:28.160 --> 01:39:34.200]   These are any device with a live Internet connection or a live network connection belongs to the
[01:39:34.200 --> 01:39:35.200]   Internet of Things.
[01:39:35.200 --> 01:39:37.200]   Explain it in more detail.
[01:39:37.200 --> 01:39:38.200]   Could I?
[01:39:38.200 --> 01:39:39.200]   I don't know.
[01:39:39.200 --> 01:39:41.880]   I'll leave that to you, John.
[01:39:41.880 --> 01:39:44.720]   You got seniority in that one.
[01:39:44.720 --> 01:39:47.960]   There's a buoy outside of Hathman Bay that tweets every hour.
[01:39:47.960 --> 01:39:51.240]   Is that considered being an Internet of Things?
[01:39:51.240 --> 01:39:52.240]   Absolutely.
[01:39:52.240 --> 01:39:53.840]   What does it do?
[01:39:53.840 --> 01:39:57.080]   It tweets the wave height every hour so that the surfers know.
[01:39:57.080 --> 01:39:58.800]   Is that all predictable though?
[01:39:58.800 --> 01:39:59.800]   No.
[01:39:59.800 --> 01:40:03.080]   Sometimes the waves are like 20.
[01:40:03.080 --> 01:40:07.080]   It shows the periodic, pre-odyssey, whatever.
[01:40:07.080 --> 01:40:11.640]   It shows how many seconds you have to catch the next wave.
[01:40:11.640 --> 01:40:13.360]   London Bridge has a Twitter account.
[01:40:13.360 --> 01:40:16.320]   It tweets whether it's up or whether it's down.
[01:40:16.320 --> 01:40:19.760]   That could come in handy.
[01:40:19.760 --> 01:40:27.000]   When you go across the border from Washington to Canada over to Vancouver, you can tell
[01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:30.800]   it's been tweaked to the border crossing.
[01:40:30.800 --> 01:40:35.600]   It tweets back how long the wait time is to go through the border.
[01:40:35.600 --> 01:40:42.040]   All sorts of useless information about the Internet.
[01:40:42.040 --> 01:40:44.600]   People started talking about this 20 years ago and they said your refrigerator will know
[01:40:44.600 --> 01:40:45.920]   when you need milk.
[01:40:45.920 --> 01:40:46.920]   Which is like...
[01:40:46.920 --> 01:40:47.920]   It still doesn't.
[01:40:47.920 --> 01:40:49.680]   No, it doesn't and never will because you don't know.
[01:40:49.680 --> 01:40:52.120]   You put the milk on a different shelf.
[01:40:52.120 --> 01:40:53.120]   I don't know.
[01:40:53.120 --> 01:40:54.120]   Maybe I don't want milk.
[01:40:54.120 --> 01:40:55.120]   How about that?
[01:40:55.120 --> 01:41:02.080]   No, actually my refrigerator tweets, my wife tweets to me, "Pick up milk on the way home."
[01:41:02.080 --> 01:41:05.640]   Back in the late 90s, the IBM had a bunch of commercials about this and they had the
[01:41:05.640 --> 01:41:09.680]   guy coming to the door, the woman who said she's getting her curlers and he says, "Hi,
[01:41:09.680 --> 01:41:11.640]   I'm the washer repair man."
[01:41:11.640 --> 01:41:14.280]   He said, "I came here to fix the wash."
[01:41:14.280 --> 01:41:15.280]   She said, "I didn't call you."
[01:41:15.280 --> 01:41:18.960]   He says, "No, the washing machine called me."
[01:41:18.960 --> 01:41:23.920]   I'm thinking this guy could be a criminal.
[01:41:23.920 --> 01:41:27.440]   That's just like bull crap that you're going to put up with some stranger coming because
[01:41:27.440 --> 01:41:31.120]   your washing machine is making phone calls.
[01:41:31.120 --> 01:41:33.480]   I don't think it's kind of interesting to have...
[01:41:33.480 --> 01:41:36.440]   Everything have telemetry and have an interface to everything.
[01:41:36.440 --> 01:41:41.160]   I don't know if it's necessarily to call the repair man or to get more milk, but I think
[01:41:41.160 --> 01:41:43.680]   having this kind of telemetry built into everything and...
[01:41:43.680 --> 01:41:44.680]   It's all...
[01:41:44.680 --> 01:41:48.120]   They're going to hook everything up to power line IP.
[01:41:48.120 --> 01:41:49.840]   All the appliances in your house are going to be...
[01:41:49.840 --> 01:41:50.840]   Well, they're doing it now.
[01:41:50.840 --> 01:41:52.960]   I've got a smart meter on my...
[01:41:52.960 --> 01:41:56.800]   It's going to be worse and then eventually the refrigerator is going to have an LCD screen
[01:41:56.800 --> 01:41:57.800]   on.
[01:41:57.800 --> 01:41:59.840]   It's going to be hooked to the internet and all you're going to get every time you go to
[01:41:59.840 --> 01:42:01.320]   the refrigerator is an ad.
[01:42:01.320 --> 01:42:02.320]   Yeah, Safeway.
[01:42:02.320 --> 01:42:03.400]   Here, buy some more of this.
[01:42:03.400 --> 01:42:04.400]   Buy some more of that.
[01:42:04.400 --> 01:42:05.400]   There's a coupon.
[01:42:05.400 --> 01:42:06.400]   Hit this button.
[01:42:06.400 --> 01:42:07.400]   It'll print it out on your computer.
[01:42:07.400 --> 01:42:08.400]   Who needs this aggravation?
[01:42:08.400 --> 01:42:10.000]   We've got enough ads already.
[01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:11.440]   It's driving everybody crazy.
[01:42:11.440 --> 01:42:12.440]   It's ruining the world.
[01:42:12.440 --> 01:42:19.280]   Philip K. Dick wrote a great short story about that where ads on every possible surface...
[01:42:19.280 --> 01:42:22.880]   I still think it's a good thing to put them in the urinals.
[01:42:22.880 --> 01:42:23.880]   We haven't even had an ad there.
[01:42:23.880 --> 01:42:25.240]   You know what we have in our urinal?
[01:42:25.240 --> 01:42:26.240]   We have a little bumblebee.
[01:42:26.240 --> 01:42:27.840]   Hey, by the way, your urinal...
[01:42:27.840 --> 01:42:28.840]   It's broken.
[01:42:28.840 --> 01:42:29.840]   Yeah.
[01:42:29.840 --> 01:42:30.840]   You have a high-tech urinal that's broken.
[01:42:30.840 --> 01:42:31.840]   It's broken.
[01:42:31.840 --> 01:42:33.240]   You've got a bunch of high-tech toilets here.
[01:42:33.240 --> 01:42:39.680]   By the way, never if you go to this toilet, don't ever push the button that says RT.
[01:42:39.680 --> 01:42:42.640]   It doesn't stand for retweet.
[01:42:42.640 --> 01:42:45.120]   Anyone who knows jokes will get that one.
[01:42:45.120 --> 01:42:47.040]   Obviously, Scoble knew what you were talking about.
[01:42:47.040 --> 01:42:49.240]   I thought you were talking about retweeting.
[01:42:49.240 --> 01:42:50.840]   One last thing about tweeting.
[01:42:50.840 --> 01:42:52.320]   One last story.
[01:42:52.320 --> 01:42:53.320]   We mentioned this.
[01:42:53.320 --> 01:42:58.720]   Dennis Ritchie, the guy who was a co-creator of Unix in 1970, designer and original developer
[01:42:58.720 --> 01:43:00.120]   of the C programming language.
[01:43:00.120 --> 01:43:02.840]   Actually, gosh, I went to bring it to the table.
[01:43:02.840 --> 01:43:09.160]   I've got his book, "K&R," they called it, the original C beautiful, elegant book.
[01:43:09.160 --> 01:43:12.680]   John, it's on the bookshelf somewhere in there.
[01:43:12.680 --> 01:43:13.680]   It's really skinny.
[01:43:13.680 --> 01:43:17.160]   It's all beat up.
[01:43:17.160 --> 01:43:24.840]   He really was a pioneer and passed away alone, sad to say, at his home this past weekend
[01:43:24.840 --> 01:43:29.440]   after a long battle against an unspecified illness.
[01:43:29.440 --> 01:43:30.440]   He didn't tweet.
[01:43:30.440 --> 01:43:31.440]   He didn't Google+.
[01:43:31.440 --> 01:43:32.440]   He didn't Facebook.
[01:43:32.440 --> 01:43:33.440]   Good for him.
[01:43:33.440 --> 01:43:39.840]   Without him, I think maybe a lot of what we have today wouldn't exist.
[01:43:39.840 --> 01:43:45.660]   James Grimmelman on Twitter tweeted, "His pointer has been cast to void asterisk.
[01:43:45.660 --> 01:43:49.000]   His process has been terminated with exit code zero."
[01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:50.960]   We just thought we'd mention that.
[01:43:50.960 --> 01:43:56.720]   Dennis Ritchie passed away at the age of 70 this week.
[01:43:56.720 --> 01:44:00.200]   Any other stories, Om, that you're covering that we have not talked about?
[01:44:00.200 --> 01:44:03.440]   What's going to be big this week?
[01:44:03.440 --> 01:44:04.440]   I don't know.
[01:44:04.440 --> 01:44:05.440]   I just want to get to tomorrow.
[01:44:05.440 --> 01:44:06.440]   That's it.
[01:44:06.440 --> 01:44:10.440]   I'll tell you what.
[01:44:10.440 --> 01:44:16.360]   Tom Merritt, let's ask him because he's covering the week ahead.
[01:44:16.360 --> 01:44:17.360]   Okay.
[01:44:17.360 --> 01:44:18.360]   Thanks, Leo.
[01:44:18.360 --> 01:44:22.720]   Here's a look at some of the stories we'll be keeping an eye on in the week ahead for

[01:44:36.440 --> 01:44:38.400]   Don't know if it'll be a somber affair.
[01:44:38.400 --> 01:44:42.480]   Motorola Spider is expected to be introduced on that day and it's happy birthday to the
[01:44:42.480 --> 01:44:43.480]   Nintendo NES.
[01:44:43.480 --> 01:44:48.600]   Wednesday, October 19th, Asia D Conference is happening in Hong Kong and at the same

[01:45:09.400 --> 01:45:10.400]   That's a look at the week ahead.
[01:45:10.400 --> 01:45:11.400]   Back to you, Leo.
[01:45:11.400 --> 01:45:13.320]   Catch Tom Merritt every single day we cover Tech News.
[01:45:13.320 --> 01:45:14.320]   Here's a look at some of the stories.
[01:45:14.320 --> 01:45:15.320]   You're welcome, Tom.
[01:45:15.320 --> 01:45:17.360]   Can I ask Tom a question?
[01:45:17.360 --> 01:45:18.800]   Yeah, would you go ahead?
[01:45:18.800 --> 01:45:19.800]   Tom, don't go yet.
[01:45:19.800 --> 01:45:23.720]   Hey, Tom, I wanted to ask you a question about that phone.
[01:45:23.720 --> 01:45:24.720]   That rim thing.
[01:45:24.720 --> 01:45:25.720]   You know, the rim thing.
[01:45:25.720 --> 01:45:26.720]   What about that camera thing going on?
[01:45:26.720 --> 01:45:27.720]   Yeah, where the hell is it?
[01:45:27.720 --> 01:45:28.720]   Where is it going to be again?
[01:45:28.720 --> 01:45:29.720]   What was the website?
[01:45:29.720 --> 01:45:32.720]   It's going to be on the website.
[01:45:32.720 --> 01:45:38.200]   He's a little more limited than Siri, I just got to tell you right now.
[01:45:38.200 --> 01:45:43.560]   Tom Merritt joins us every Monday through Friday at 2.30 Pacific, 5.30 Eastern for TNT
[01:45:43.560 --> 01:45:44.560]   Tech News Today.
[01:45:44.560 --> 01:45:47.760]   Make sure you catch the latest Tech News, Tom and Sarah and I Ask.
[01:45:47.760 --> 01:45:51.360]   Cover it all every day on the Twit network.
[01:45:51.360 --> 01:45:53.800]   We did cover that global outage of Blackberry.
[01:45:53.800 --> 01:45:57.040]   I just have to, you just have to, it's one thing after another for rim.
[01:45:57.040 --> 01:45:59.440]   I just have to feel for them.
[01:45:59.440 --> 01:46:03.120]   I don't know how much longer this pain can go on.
[01:46:03.120 --> 01:46:06.280]   I am looking forward though to that Nexus Prime and ice cream sandwich and I have a
[01:46:06.280 --> 01:46:09.440]   feeling Google might have a rejoinder to Siri.
[01:46:09.440 --> 01:46:11.520]   I have something to say.
[01:46:11.520 --> 01:46:15.160]   Jay Wagon, our chat room says rim stands for research in morons.
[01:46:15.160 --> 01:46:18.000]   Oh, ow, ow.
[01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.640]   Ohm, thanks for being here.
[01:46:20.640 --> 01:46:21.640]   We appreciate it.
[01:46:21.640 --> 01:46:23.580]   GigaOhm.com is his blog.
[01:46:23.580 --> 01:46:28.120]   The must see place if you want to follow things.
[01:46:28.120 --> 01:46:31.800]   When you do invest in some companies, do you feel that makes it difficult?
[01:46:31.800 --> 01:46:36.120]   I don't invest in companies and we don't, I do invest in companies but we don't write
[01:46:36.120 --> 01:46:39.120]   about them at all on our site period.
[01:46:39.120 --> 01:46:41.560]   So if you invest in a company, that's it.
[01:46:41.560 --> 01:46:42.840]   You no longer can write about it.
[01:46:42.840 --> 01:46:44.600]   I don't even write about the companies.
[01:46:44.600 --> 01:46:47.520]   I don't even write about their competitors.
[01:46:47.520 --> 01:46:48.520]   That's interesting.
[01:46:48.520 --> 01:46:49.520]   You don't find that limiting?
[01:46:49.520 --> 01:46:50.520]   It's old school.
[01:46:50.520 --> 01:46:51.520]   I love it.
[01:46:51.520 --> 01:46:52.520]   No.
[01:46:52.520 --> 01:46:53.520]   So you would probably agree that what...
[01:46:53.520 --> 01:46:54.520]   There's plenty to write about.
[01:46:54.520 --> 01:46:56.720]   What, yeah, there's plenty to write about, isn't there?
[01:46:56.720 --> 01:46:57.720]   Yeah.
[01:46:57.720 --> 01:46:58.720]   So what companies can you invest in?
[01:46:58.720 --> 01:47:02.680]   Well, I'm glad, Ohm, that you maintain that standard because I agree with that.
[01:47:02.680 --> 01:47:05.520]   Robert and I don't have any money so we don't invest in anything at all.
[01:47:05.520 --> 01:47:06.520]   We just cover everything.
[01:47:06.520 --> 01:47:08.560]   I got 20 bucks.
[01:47:08.560 --> 01:47:12.800]   Robert's at Rackspace and of course, building43.com is where you can catch his videos.
[01:47:12.800 --> 01:47:16.280]   He interviews the most interesting startups.
[01:47:16.280 --> 01:47:21.100]   You know that LCD screen guys that you interviewed?
[01:47:21.100 --> 01:47:26.360]   They were at CDIA, the home theater installer show, this couple of weeks ago and apparently
[01:47:26.360 --> 01:47:29.200]   some big TV sets are going to start using that technology.
[01:47:29.200 --> 01:47:30.520]   It really looks good I hear.
[01:47:30.520 --> 01:47:31.520]   Yeah?
[01:47:31.520 --> 01:47:32.520]   He's nodding.
[01:47:32.520 --> 01:47:33.520]   CES is going to be fun.
[01:47:33.520 --> 01:47:34.520]   Are you going to CES?
[01:47:34.520 --> 01:47:35.520]   Oh yeah, we'll be there.
[01:47:35.520 --> 01:47:36.520]   We'll be covering CES as we did before.
[01:47:36.520 --> 01:47:37.520]   We've got the Sky booth.
[01:47:37.520 --> 01:47:38.520]   Please come over.
[01:47:38.520 --> 01:47:39.520]   You're going to be traveling as much as I am.
[01:47:39.520 --> 01:47:40.520]   Yeah, please come.
[01:47:40.520 --> 01:47:41.520]   He's going to Paris in December.
[01:47:41.520 --> 01:47:42.520]   You're going to go to LeWeb?
[01:47:42.520 --> 01:47:43.520]   Yeah, did you see the...
[01:47:43.520 --> 01:47:44.520]   I did see you on LeWeb's page.
[01:47:44.520 --> 01:47:50.080]   Well, I put up a video with the magician, the technology magician today and that was pretty
[01:47:50.080 --> 01:47:51.080]   cool.
[01:47:51.080 --> 01:47:52.080]   Oh, that's cool.
[01:47:52.080 --> 01:47:53.080]   That's going to be at LeWeb?
[01:47:53.080 --> 01:47:54.080]   Yeah.
[01:47:54.080 --> 01:47:55.080]   Technology magician.
[01:47:55.080 --> 01:47:56.080]   Yeah.
[01:47:56.080 --> 01:47:57.080]   We're going to...
[01:47:57.080 --> 01:48:01.520]   LeWeb is Louis Glamour's entrepreneurial show that goes on in Paris December 6th, 7th
[01:48:01.520 --> 01:48:02.520]   and 8th.
[01:48:02.520 --> 01:48:03.520]   Junk It.
[01:48:03.520 --> 01:48:04.520]   No, no, it's not a junk it.
[01:48:04.520 --> 01:48:06.080]   No, we have to pay our own way.
[01:48:06.080 --> 01:48:07.080]   And we are...
[01:48:07.080 --> 01:48:08.080]   There's going to...
[01:48:08.080 --> 01:48:09.080]   We're...
[01:48:09.080 --> 01:48:10.080]   Twitch is going to be in Paris.
[01:48:10.080 --> 01:48:11.080]   We're going to have a booth there.
[01:48:11.080 --> 01:48:12.080]   We're going to interview people.
[01:48:12.080 --> 01:48:13.080]   It is Paris.
[01:48:13.080 --> 01:48:14.080]   We're actually going to broadcast from LeWeb for those three days.
[01:48:14.080 --> 01:48:18.800]   Junk It.
[01:48:18.800 --> 01:48:19.800]   What company is...
[01:48:19.800 --> 01:48:20.800]   I don't understand.
[01:48:20.800 --> 01:48:21.800]   Who's paying?
[01:48:21.800 --> 01:48:22.800]   Did you not invite John?
[01:48:22.800 --> 01:48:23.800]   Oh, that's it.
[01:48:23.800 --> 01:48:24.800]   He's grumpy.
[01:48:24.800 --> 01:48:25.800]   He's not...
[01:48:25.800 --> 01:48:29.440]   How could it be a junk it if there was no company that were sponsoring it?
[01:48:29.440 --> 01:48:30.880]   I don't understand what the junk it part is.
[01:48:30.880 --> 01:48:31.880]   It's a junk it.
[01:48:31.880 --> 01:48:32.880]   It's a junk it?
[01:48:32.880 --> 01:48:37.000]   No, if it's a junk it, I like it.
[01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:38.000]   And...
[01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:39.000]   I want to be there too.
[01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:40.000]   Are you going to go home?
[01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:41.000]   I am.
[01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:42.000]   Awesome.
[01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:43.000]   Excellent.
[01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:46.000]   Well, I hope you and Scoble will come by the IBM booth.
[01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:47.000]   For the junk it.
[01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:48.000]   For the trick coverage.
[01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:49.000]   That's going to be a lot of...
[01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:50.000]   I think that's the show title, "Junk It."
[01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:51.000]   It's going to be a lot of fun.
[01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:52.000]   And then, yes, we're going to have a little bit of a...
[01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:53.000]   We're going to have a little bit of a...
[01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:54.000]   We're going to have a little bit of a...
[01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:57.920]   It's going to be a lot of fun, and then, yes, we will be at CES for another junk it.
[01:48:57.920 --> 01:48:58.920]   A junk it.
[01:48:58.920 --> 01:49:01.000]   A junk it which costs us about $50,000.
[01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:02.000]   Is that okay?
[01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:03.000]   It's okay.
[01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:04.000]   Can a junk it cost you money?
[01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:05.760]   Apparently, it does with you.
[01:49:05.760 --> 01:49:06.760]   You're not doing it right.
[01:49:06.760 --> 01:49:07.760]   I'm not doing it right.
[01:49:07.760 --> 01:49:09.240]   You're not holding it right.
[01:49:09.240 --> 01:49:13.280]   Well, you know, I feel good because Tech TV spent a million dollars covering CES.
[01:49:13.280 --> 01:49:14.600]   Yeah, and they did a crappy job.
[01:49:14.600 --> 01:49:15.920]   I've always reminded you that Tech TV...
[01:49:15.920 --> 01:49:18.800]   We used to do Silicon Spin there, and they'd never mic the audience.
[01:49:18.800 --> 01:49:19.800]   Right.
[01:49:19.800 --> 01:49:23.080]   So you go in there and you say something hilarious and then you watch it on TV.
[01:49:23.080 --> 01:49:27.160]   It was like dead silence and then a long wait for the audience to stop laughing.
[01:49:27.160 --> 01:49:30.000]   But of course, somebody watching you can see a long pause.
[01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:31.000]   You look like a bunch of idiots.
[01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:32.000]   They spent a million dollars.
[01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.640]   John, John, John, can I tell you one thing?
[01:49:34.640 --> 01:49:37.640]   You were not very funny.
[01:49:37.640 --> 01:49:43.440]   By the way, we got to go because it's getting darker and darker in Ohm's room.
[01:49:43.440 --> 01:49:44.440]   Yeah, it's like...
[01:49:44.440 --> 01:49:45.440]   It's like...
[01:49:45.440 --> 01:49:46.440]   Dusk has fallen and people...
[01:49:46.440 --> 01:49:49.920]   I get back in the coffin in a minute.
[01:49:49.920 --> 01:49:50.920]   All right.
[01:49:50.920 --> 01:49:52.800]   Hey, thank you, Robert Scoble.
[01:49:52.800 --> 01:49:53.800]   Thank you, John C. Dvorak.
[01:49:53.800 --> 01:49:54.800]   Channeldvorak.com and of course, noagenda.show.com.
[01:49:54.800 --> 01:50:03.040]   I also want to mention x3show.mevio.com and generationx3show.mevio.com and also Andrew
[01:50:03.040 --> 01:50:05.120]   Eisner wants to get on Twitter.
[01:50:05.120 --> 01:50:06.120]   Who's Andrew Eisner?
[01:50:06.120 --> 01:50:08.920]   He used to be at the ZD Labs.
[01:50:08.920 --> 01:50:12.360]   He's with Retrievo or one of those...
[01:50:12.360 --> 01:50:14.000]   I should remember, but I can't remember.
[01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:15.480]   I don't remember, Andrew.
[01:50:15.480 --> 01:50:16.480]   Oh, well...
[01:50:16.480 --> 01:50:17.640]   Well, he can come on.
[01:50:17.640 --> 01:50:19.240]   Anybody can be on Twitter.
[01:50:19.240 --> 01:50:21.360]   No, not everybody.
[01:50:21.360 --> 01:50:23.360]   I want to thank all the people in our audience today.
[01:50:23.360 --> 01:50:24.360]   Thank you for stopping by.
[01:50:24.360 --> 01:50:25.360]   We appreciate it.
[01:50:25.360 --> 01:50:26.360]   We got a good crowd.
[01:50:26.360 --> 01:50:28.240]   We didn't mic them, though, so you can't tell they're here.
[01:50:28.240 --> 01:50:30.360]   There's a huge crowd here today.
[01:50:30.360 --> 01:50:32.280]   You know, it's because they heard you were going to be here.
[01:50:32.280 --> 01:50:33.280]   No, no, that's not the reason.
[01:50:33.280 --> 01:50:35.560]   I think that you're getting people...
[01:50:35.560 --> 01:50:37.880]   You're paying people to come.
[01:50:37.880 --> 01:50:40.880]   They're all on junkets.
[01:50:40.880 --> 01:50:43.000]   Junkets metal.
[01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:44.000]   Don't forget we do this...
[01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:45.000]   Actually, what's a better junket?
[01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000]   Paris or going to the Twit Studio, you know?
[01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:48.000]   Paris.
[01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:49.000]   Give me Paris any day.
[01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:50.000]   Come on.
[01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:51.000]   Paris in December, coming to Twit.
[01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:52.000]   Paris in December.
[01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:53.680]   It's a little cold in December in Paris.
[01:50:53.680 --> 01:50:55.120]   It's freezing.
[01:50:55.120 --> 01:50:57.140]   We do invite you to watch the show live.
[01:50:57.140 --> 01:50:58.140]   We do it live.
[01:50:58.140 --> 01:51:02.680]   Normally, we're a little late today because of a junket, but we are live normally 3 p.m.
[01:51:02.680 --> 01:51:04.200]   Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern.
[01:51:04.200 --> 01:51:07.640]   That is 2200 UTC @twit.tv.
[01:51:07.640 --> 01:51:09.920]   But if you miss the show, don't worry about it.
[01:51:09.920 --> 01:51:13.440]   We record it so you can watch it or listen to it at your leisure.
[01:51:13.440 --> 01:51:19.040]   All the podcast versions are available also at twit.tv.
[01:51:19.040 --> 01:51:23.320]   Anything else Eileen Rivera, our esteemed producer that I should mention?
[01:51:23.320 --> 01:51:26.600]   We are going to be covering the Samsung Google announcement.
[01:51:26.600 --> 01:51:27.600]   We're going to cover that live?
[01:51:27.600 --> 01:51:28.600]   Yeah.
[01:51:28.600 --> 01:51:32.560]   It's 7 p.m. our time, and then we're immediately going to do all about Android right afterwards.
[01:51:32.560 --> 01:51:34.400]   So that'll be Wednesday, October 19th.
[01:51:34.400 --> 01:51:37.480]   Tune in 7 p.m. Pacific, 10 p.m. Eastern.
[01:51:37.480 --> 01:51:40.520]   And there is going to be a stream of that, so we'll be able to watch the stream.
[01:51:40.520 --> 01:51:44.920]   And of course, Jason Howell and Eileen Rivera, who host our Android show, will be commenting
[01:51:44.920 --> 01:51:47.520]   on that so you can follow what's going on.
[01:51:47.520 --> 01:51:48.960]   Is it Tuesday night or is it...
[01:51:48.960 --> 01:51:50.120]   It's Tuesday night for us.
[01:51:50.120 --> 01:51:51.400]   It's Wednesday morning in Hong Kong.
[01:51:51.400 --> 01:51:53.000]   So that's what that...
[01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:56.920]   So they say October 19th, but it is 7 p.m. October 18th, Tuesday.
[01:51:56.920 --> 01:51:58.880]   So a special time for all about Android.
