[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:13.440]   was on vacation. Last week Alex Lindsay, I understood it was an unruly bunch. Thank you Alex for holding
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:19.280]   down the fort. Who else hosted? Jason Stell that's Snell Host. Jason Stell Hosted. Karsten.
[00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:26.560]   And it's in the distance. It's in the distance. Oh, we had all the hosts right? We had Jason,
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.440]   Mike, and Ant to show it. I hear that was great. Well, thank you all of you for filling in for me.
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:37.760]   I am here and we have a great panel for you. Say hi to Brianna Wu, Congress candidate in the
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:45.120]   Massachusetts eighth game developer, the Twitter personality former known as Space Cat Cal.
[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.640]   You're never going to let me live in a new video. No, her campaign staff said, you know, really,
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:57.040]   you should use your name. I feel like you can't judge me from the Gmail I came up with. I was like
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:03.200]   in my early 20s and I just stuck with it forever. But everybody is saddled with the handle they created
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:10.880]   first time they got online. Yes. That's that's how it is in life. I was I'm so old that I actually
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:18.800]   have my name. Also with us, Brian McCullough. He is our tech meme ride home host. Hello, Brian.
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:24.640]   Hey, Leo. How are you? Internet historian. It's good to have you.
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:33.520]   Good to be here. My brother's my brother's handle on prodigy was physicata, but he spelled it wrong
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:40.160]   so that if you actually read it out, it was psychotic. And I pointed that out to him and he got so
[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:45.520]   pissed at me, but he never got to change it. You're stuck. The only time you really should change
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:50.880]   is if there's numbers like if he's physicata 4138, then you should change it. That's just bad.
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:57.600]   But I like physicata or psychicata, whatever it is. Also with us, Daniel Rabino, executive editor,
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.800]   window center. Hello, Daniel. Hello. Welcome back. Thank you for having me.
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.600]   Yeah. I'm this wonderful dark gloomy Saturday or Sunday, I should say. Where are you? It's cold
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:13.120]   out here. Where are you? Massachusetts. It's dark and gloomy. Oh, yeah. Is it dark? Like,
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.760]   is it snowing? Are you in an Arctic vortex? It's getting there. It's getting there. We're
[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:23.920]   pretty close to snow. Oh, man. Hey, are you in Western Mass or Eastern Mass, Daniel?
[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:30.560]   Central Mass, Central. It's such a big state. They have the western region. The second largest
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.320]   city in all new. Oh, Worcester. I know. I know. I grew up in Providence, but we don't call it
[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:42.400]   Worcester. We call it Worcester. We call it the woo. It's also where the smiley face was invented.
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:47.600]   I don't know people that the hippie 1960 smiley face thing. It was invented in Worcester.
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.680]   I know it's weird. I don't invent to that, but yeah, that's where it actually started from.
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:56.560]   I have a Christmas ornament with it. So if they invented it, did they make a million bucks on it?
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:01.840]   I don't know the status of the copyright for it, but there was the artist that made it in
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.920]   popular or iced it is from here. I think they couldn't have made any money because it's really
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:10.800]   it's just I said, it's an ice in a bath. The only thing that's distinct about it has no nose.
[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:17.600]   Right. Before I start the show, can I say Daniel, I will steal every one of those controllers on
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:22.400]   your show. No, is that awesome? Yes. I gave him a hard time about that the last time he was on.
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:27.120]   Oh, that's beautiful. Best controller collection in the showbiz. Oh, wow. That's like a quarter of
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:32.480]   them. The rest are somewhere else in the house. They're being used the rest of them.
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:38.480]   Yes. Clearly or not. Yes. This is this is only the Xbox wing. Yeah. That's right. That's right.
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:44.080]   Do you use the elite controller on your Xbox? Yeah, when I can. I don't I don't have the second one,
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:48.480]   actually. The new one. I just came out. So that's a nice one. Paul was very excited about that.
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:53.280]   Yeah. Yeah. So the elite's pretty good, but then I love all the color and options. I don't know.
[00:05:53.280 --> 00:06:00.000]   I could do that behind me with MacBook Pros. All right. And and mostly MacBook Pros that are barely
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:06.800]   used because the keyboard was so crappy, Apple stunned this week when they announced not only
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:12.160]   we're going to give you a new 16 inch, which by the way, I had given up on. I thought, Oh,
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:16.960]   because Ming Chi Quo, the analyst said it'll be next year. They they slipped it out. There's a
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:22.880]   little press release. But not only that, it has this as far as we could tell for I fix it,
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:28.160]   stare down. It has pretty much the same keyboard as the classic 2015 MacBook.
[00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:35.200]   As as somebody said, it's the un john Johnny Ived keyboard. I don't think you could blame
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:42.480]   John Mey Ive for those terrible keyboards. But but anyway, Marco Armin on Marco.org is so excited.
[00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:48.240]   He had a list of things he wanted with the MacBook Pro, none of which he got it except the better
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:53.120]   keyboard. He said, that's enough. That's all I need. A decent keyboard scissor key switches.
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:07:00.640]   It's not cheap. But you can go up to 64 gigs of RAM. You can go up to eight terabytes,
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:04.400]   which I don't know. I don't think anybody Daniel know Windows machine has eight terabytes of
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:10.480]   storage. Does it laptop? Yeah, I mean, most high for it is two or you can do there are computers
[00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:14.960]   now that have dual SSD slots in them. So I don't even have three. Those are really rare. And you
[00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:20.560]   can like make a raid. I could do that on my on my one of my one of my the ThinkPad extreme, I think
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:26.160]   had two extra so I could put two drives in and plus the M.2 drive. So yeah, you could, you know,
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:31.520]   but even then eight would be you'd have to really jam. Yeah, I haven't seen many like SSDs they
[00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:36.880]   can buy that would I guess if they're even rated, you need four terabyte ones, which I haven't seen
[00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:42.160]   either way. No two terabytes, which are pretty rare. I don't know if it's I don't know if it's
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:45.520]   it probably is a special Apple part. They're known to they're known to do that.
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:53.280]   They're also using the newest i9 processors, which is actually not any different than the last
[00:07:53.280 --> 00:08:01.360]   Macbook, bro, except this time they're properly cooled. So Apple says it can actually be faster now.
[00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:09.440]   It's impressive. You know, in terms of specifications, I know developers are really excited about that.
[00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:14.320]   I mean, having 64 gigs and eight terabytes, yeah, so the videographer, video editors are going to
[00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:19.120]   be really happy with those stats. And as someone who obviously covers Windows PCs, you know,
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:23.760]   well, jealous. I mean, we don't have that much that goes up that high in terms of specifications.
[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:29.360]   I think the Dell XPS 15 will be the closest, but even that you can now do 64 gigs set. That
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:34.080]   comes with the latest Intel chips. They allow you to go that high. Yeah. So you can do that, but
[00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:40.800]   yeah, that's yeah. This is some impressive numbers for for laptop and six grand. It has a physical
[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:49.760]   escape key. I'm so excited. I can do what I say. Daniel, you know, this one, the biggest
[00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:55.520]   difference is between Mac laptop and a Windows laptop is the implementation of OpenGL, which is
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:09:01.920]   inherently less efficient on Mac every test of Apple's abandoned. Apple's abandoned it. They
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:07.200]   don't do OpenGL at all anymore. But then you have to go over to metal for everything. And of course,
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:13.600]   the implementation that is limited. This is my 2015 MacBook Pro, which I will never give up.
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:19.840]   Because I've got that to screen GPU in it. You know, they've moved to integrated with the 13
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:26.080]   inch and this is the first laptop I've seen in a long time. If I were not running for Congress
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:32.000]   and I was developing games, I would really be tempted to go buy this. You know, my 15 inch
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.200]   laptop, it's lasted me for four years. It's a great machine. And you know, at this price,
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:41.440]   yeah, you should be able to use it five or six years. I think this is a reasonable replacement
[00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:46.880]   for that classic 2015, which I also used for years because it was the only it was the last decent
[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:52.000]   keyboard. They do have a discrete GPU in these new ones. They have, of course, an AMD Radeon
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:10:01.520]   Pro. You can get the 5500 with 8 gigs of GDDR or you can get the step down from that.
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:13.440]   If you if you max it out, it is a $6,000 laptop. But and Daniel, maybe you can comment on this.
[00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:18.880]   Somebody in our in our Twit community mentioned that is that he got the same one I did,
[00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:23.360]   which was $36.99. But he said, but if I got the same specs in the Lenovo, it would have been over
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:30.400]   4000. So is as expensive as these are, this is a high end machine and these aren't completely
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:34.640]   out of line for a high end Windows machine either, right? Yeah, I mean, it's one of the
[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:40.240]   ever since the Surface has came out, their whole push has been to drive OEMs to make higher quality
[00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:46.480]   laptops. And you know, back in 2015, I have the MacBook Pro because they were so good,
[00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:50.240]   even putting Windows 10 on it was still sometimes a better experience.
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:54.960]   Mossberg and the Wall Street Journal famously said the best Windows machine out there is the
[00:10:54.960 --> 00:11:01.360]   MacBook Pro. It's true. And in 2015, you make that argument, you know, but I would say because
[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:07.280]   of Microsoft's pushing Surface, now you have HP, you have Lenovo and Dell who all make some
[00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:13.200]   really killer laptops in terms of quality performance and hardware that, you know, rival the MacBooks.
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:19.440]   And then you had Apple themselves screw up, right? It was the keyboards and four years almost of
[00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:24.880]   really negative coverage of these keyboards. And you combine that, it's no surprise that they saw
[00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:30.000]   a dip in sales. Now, they're, you know, this is good at their making a comeback, right? This is
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.680]   going to be, I think a really popular laptop. I think a lot of people will buy it. I think
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:38.800]   exactly like Brianna, like people from the 2015 version will definitely want to upgrade to this.
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:43.040]   And that's actually a nice upgrade path. I mean, four years is a long time. But if you have the
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:49.360]   2015 version, that is what most people hold on to laptops for four or five years. That's
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:54.880]   normal. It's not like people like me who gets one every three weeks. So I think this was a good
[00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:59.680]   move by Apple, but they didn't hold a press event, right? And I think the reason for that was obvious.
[00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:02.880]   They would have loved to have shared all this stuff, but half of it would have been we're
[00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:09.040]   walking everything back. So that's not a good story to tell. That's that's the amazing thing. Like,
[00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:15.120]   kudos to Apple for having walked this tightrope that we all knew they were walking,
[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:22.000]   that they never had to admit that they screwed up, that they never had to do a recall. They just
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.800]   said, Oh, you know those magic keyboards that we ship with iMacs? Yeah, we put those in in
[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:31.760]   laptops now because those are really the best keyboards. And so they got to paint it as progress
[00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:36.400]   as opposed to admitting mistakes. Like that that's chef's kiss sort of PR.
[00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:41.040]   To be fair, they kind of admitted a mistake because they do have a it's not a recall,
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:45.120]   but they do have a repair program for the replacement for the butterfly.
[00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:49.920]   fiasco, but you're right. They also they and by the way to Apple's credit,
[00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:55.520]   they admitted they made a horrible mistake with the last Mac Pro. They're not above admitting
[00:12:55.520 --> 00:13:00.480]   mistakes, but you're right. If this is just corporate PR, if you can avoid saying you're wrong,
[00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:06.080]   they are. Let's not forget still selling the butterfly keyboard on every single other Mac laptop.
[00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:10.160]   Well, that's what I was going to say. You want to talk about pent up demand when they bring this to
[00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:15.440]   the the heirs, especially, but also the 13 inches and things like that. Like,
[00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:20.400]   there's so many people myself included that have waited on the sideline. I'm sitting talking to
[00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:26.320]   you on a 2015. You know, so wow, right. It's all free of you are using 2015.
[00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:32.240]   Because I know the red and red will have one. That's amazing. Well,
[00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:37.680]   onto it. Never give it up. I am very disappointed. They did not get rid of the touch bar. You know,
[00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:44.480]   Apple moved this year. They got rid of 3D touch. Something I used. I have literally never used the
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:52.000]   touch bar in a way. I went that improved my experience. It feels like a solution in search of a problem.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.400]   It eats up battery life. I cannot tell you many times. I've just wanted to turn the volume up and
[00:13:56.400 --> 00:14:01.280]   down. You find yourself going through some menus. It's terrible. Just get rid of it.
[00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:06.640]   It's they in a way. They did the same thing. They didn't admit it, but they kind of acknowledged
[00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:10.720]   there were issues. They moved it a little farther away because one of the problems I know you have,
[00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:15.040]   I have is I hit, you know, Siri launches every time I'm trying to hit a backspace.
[00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:19.440]   So they made it a little and they separated the escape key and they separated the
[00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:25.920]   fingerprint reader. So the touch bar is, I have a feeling it's going to slowly shrink away.
[00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:33.200]   To nothing. It'll just be a little touch strip and a little touch slot. No, no, we don't have touch.
[00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:37.600]   There's no touch. What do you mean? Because nobody's really taken advantage of it.
[00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:43.920]   I think you could perhaps say to Apple, well, say on their behalf, well, they were hoping that
[00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:48.720]   this new user interface, people with lots of apps would use it and it would become a very valuable
[00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:54.240]   tool. But no, not really. That happens sometimes. That's not completely Apple's fault.
[00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:57.360]   Yes, it is. It's a piece of crap. I'm sorry.
[00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:03.440]   We're about to talk far is we just look at it. It seems like a cool idea.
[00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:07.600]   Yeah. Oh, it's really cool. If you do the kit, if you make it from night writer, if you have the
[00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:12.480]   kit thing going back and forth, then then it's cool. And that's why I always find weird about
[00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:17.440]   tech is sometimes like you see something in photos and obviously Apple is very good at graphics.
[00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:22.240]   But if you were to show anyone that in like 2015, I think most of most of you,
[00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:26.560]   that could be kind of interesting. That's kind of cool. But then it turns out that in practical
[00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:31.200]   usage, yeah, it turns out it's not a good idea. It's a porous substitute for your lack of touch
[00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:38.400]   screens, which is really what it was about, wasn't it? Yeah. But again, I don't know if Apple
[00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:43.120]   knew that it was going to be stupid and useless. And so you got to give them some credit for
[00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:49.120]   at least trying stuff, right? Well, that's the night writer, man, that makes it so cool.
[00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:53.120]   You'll even play the night writer theme if you wanted to.
[00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:57.920]   Well, in their defense, all it would have taken was one app to have made a killer use of it.
[00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:04.240]   Some Adobe or somebody had used it and oh my god, it's transformed how I use Photoshop or
[00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:09.040]   whatever. If one person had been able to do something with it, then we'd be having a different
[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:14.000]   conversation. Yes, exactly. I think this is one of the benefits with the PC world because you have
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.800]   so many manufacturers and OEMs. Like you have Lenovo, I've been giving a lot of credit to you.
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:23.520]   It makes them really wacky stuff, right? We have like the yoga book that came with the dual screens
[00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:28.720]   and in keyboard. Now they weren't expecting that to sell a ton and it was kind of an experiment
[00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:33.360]   for them to put it out there. And it's neat that they can do that and not have to like
[00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:40.400]   be their entire reputation. Whereas Apple has so few laptops that when they commit to something,
[00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:44.720]   it's the only version that's going to be out there. So they either take it away the next year,
[00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:48.640]   which is just an obvious thing or they try to write it out for it. But at some point,
[00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:53.120]   they have to make a decision as to its future status. I think this time they're going to wait
[00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:59.040]   till they do a significant redesign again before they pull it out. So yeah, I think that's fair. I
[00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:03.760]   mean, 3D Touch. I remember I had a column in Mac life about this talking like you think about
[00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:09.040]   it in theory. It makes a lot of sense. I could imagine racing games where it gradiated your
[00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:14.160]   acceleration and break versus how hard you're touching the screen. You could imagine a
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:19.600]   lot of interface uses for that. But just year after year went by and there was no real use for it
[00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:25.280]   other than as a keyboard shortcut. And I just, I think Apple should look at that and say,
[00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:29.920]   is this increasing our user's experience? Because if I'm trying to turn my screen brightness
[00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:35.200]   slightly up or slightly down, it's easier to just hit that key once or twice versus,
[00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:41.840]   okay, let me tap this, go to the slider, move it over. It's just it's bad UI. And I just,
[00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:44.560]   I wish Apple would admit that it's not working.
[00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:51.120]   I think you're right, Daniel though. Daniel's right that because Apple is the only manufacturer
[00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:56.160]   of Apple computers, Mac and Touch computers, they don't have the luxuries that, I mean,
[00:17:56.160 --> 00:18:01.520]   God, the best thing about the PC, I hate Windows 10. But I'm sorry, Daniel, you have to cover it.
[00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:07.200]   But all right. I mean, what's going on with Windows 10 1909? People are saying all sorts of
[00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:10.640]   horrible Microsoft can't seem to get put out an update that doesn't break.
[00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:14.480]   Maybe that's because they're a billion and a half users. I don't know. But they seem to have
[00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:19.520]   problems with the software. On the other hand, the great thing about the Windows ecosystem is
[00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:24.000]   the variety of hardware. You could find a laptop no matter what crazy thing you want.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.920]   You know, if you want a great keyboard, you get a Lenovo ThinkPad. If you, if you want
[00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:34.320]   Sin and Light HP's got those great new specters.
[00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:37.840]   What's your name? Daniel, is there, is there ever going to be a surface book three?
[00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:41.600]   Yes. They said there's going to be.
[00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:46.000]   Well, they haven't said publicly, but I mean, we're expecting definitely,
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.040]   there's always two surface events, right? There's usually a spring one and of course,
[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:54.400]   the October event. I would not be surprised if we see something come around for spring. I think
[00:18:54.400 --> 00:19:00.320]   the hold up is because Intel 10 Chen, they want to use, but that class of 10 Chen had to use or
[00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:05.440]   want to use that actually out yet. I think over only released a quarter of the Intel 10 Chen
[00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:10.400]   to market. So I think there will have that along with RTX 20.
[00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:15.120]   For those that aren't following the ins and outs of the of the surface line,
[00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:20.720]   the thing that's unique about the surface book, it's a laptop, but it has a special hinge and you
[00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:27.120]   can detach the screen so it can become like it can undock. And it was always, I had this first one,
[00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:35.360]   it was a source of a lot of difficulty because the GPU was in the keyboard. So all of a sudden,
[00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:40.400]   you have a machine where you've disconnected from the GPU and the operating system just goes nuts.
[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:44.800]   And it took them a long time. It took more than a year for them to solve that problem.
[00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:50.720]   Yep. And there's still occasionally issues. It's definitely a tough engineering problem in
[00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:54.880]   terms of just even a durability of that hinge, but also, as you mentioned, the electronics of
[00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:58.400]   disconnecting the GPU while you're active is pretty crazy.
[00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:04.160]   And it's a weird device. I mean, they have to have telemetry on this. Most people probably
[00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:10.080]   aren't actually using it as a tablet, right? But I never detached it, not once. So all of that,
[00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:16.960]   all of that pain was pointless. Now, I think the surface laptop, which is a laptop, but it
[00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:21.680]   doesn't detach is actually a very nice device. And I think they're getting very good reviews on the
[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:28.080]   new one. Yeah, the 15 inch one is a little that's the AMD. Now, they have it. So tell me, first of
[00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:32.640]   all, it was an older AMD chip. It wasn't the current generation. It's technically current,
[00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:38.560]   but they haven't AMD hasn't released a new rise in series for laptops, which are 2000 series,
[00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:45.280]   right? Yeah. So, so how are you know, I was gone. How's the reaction been to this? Is it?
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:52.400]   Yeah, it's it's an old Kate chip. But even I feel like Microsoft oversold its performance.
[00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:56.560]   And this really comes back to, you know, getting to the Mac too. So when you look at the 16 inch
[00:20:56.560 --> 00:21:01.680]   MacBook Pro, the thing is it's a beast. So it's a it's got some serious graphics power. It's
[00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:05.760]   comparable to the Dell XPS 15 in terms of just performance ability. Actually,
[00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:10.480]   when you look at an iMac Pro, it's a pretty high end Mac.
[00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:15.520]   But when you look at the surface laptop, three to 15 inch, you know, they're like, Oh, it's the
[00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:20.240]   fastest in its class. And I remember I smirked when they said that because I was like, it's class.
[00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:23.600]   What class is that? Is that machines without Contara keyboard rests?
[00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:30.080]   Well, it's class. It's it's basically a 15 inch ultra book. So ultra books are defined by their
[00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:37.360]   processors in 15 watt, not a Dell XPS 15 has a 45 watt chip in it. And so those are world of
[00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:42.640]   difference. So when you say it's the fastest in its class, there's barely any 15 inch ultra books.
[00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:47.520]   And there's a reason for that, which is when people go to 15 inch, they tend to then commit to a
[00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:51.840]   four pound device. That's going to have serious performance. And I get what Microsoft was trying
[00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:58.960]   to do here. The 15 inch ultra books do have a role. Some people just want that. But the AMD,
[00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:04.080]   it's just it's a generation behind the Intel's in terms of CPU performance. It's not nearly as good.
[00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:09.840]   It's not as efficient on battery life. They weren't able to do things like use DDR4X, which
[00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:16.800]   helps with battery. It doesn't have Wi-Fi six, which is weird as Wi-Fi five. And so it just
[00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:23.120]   it's and you can compare it to the Intel version. Like you can go by the Intel version of the
[00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:27.200]   Surface laptop three 15 inch. You just go to a Microsoft store and ask for it in the back and
[00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:33.280]   they'll get it for you. If you directly compare those, the Intel version is just faster. The GPU
[00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:38.720]   for AMD is slightly better, but not world difference. But I feel like this is a long term play for
[00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:42.960]   Microsoft. They're spreading the love around. They got AMD now. They got Intel like a Qualcomm.
[00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:47.120]   They got our man. Yeah. Yeah. How are people liking the the Xt?
[00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:54.080]   Oh, the service Pro X. Yeah. X rather. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. My review goes live actually probably
[00:22:54.080 --> 00:23:00.880]   Monday or Monday or Tuesday. So how are you lacking it then? I like it. But it's very nuanced. It's
[00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:05.920]   for the right person. It's a perfect device. It's but for a lot of people, they're probably
[00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:10.000]   better off with the surface. I have the surface go, which I really like. I like the size. I like
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:16.400]   the fact that it's always on. I would love longer battery life. Sure. Its performance is not great.
[00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:21.680]   But I'm and I did buy the HP and VX2, which had the arm processor and that was unusably slow.
[00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:25.200]   This is supposedly a little faster because they're using a faster Qualcomm.
[00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:31.600]   It's significantly faster. So it's usable. Yeah. Except you have to use arm apps.
[00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:37.600]   That's where he gets the nuance, right? So apps that are recompiled for ARM 64 or
[00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:43.760]   UWP apps that are found in the Microsoft store run very well on it. We're talking even with the GPU,
[00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:50.640]   it can be an 8th gen core I5, even with graphics. That's very good news. Yeah. The bad news is that
[00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:56.320]   the non arm, not recompiled apps run terribly, right? They're very slow. I want to say terrible.
[00:23:56.320 --> 00:24:00.400]   It'd be equivalent to about a core I3 for an 8th gen. That's not bad. That's usable. No, no.
[00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:05.680]   It's quite good. What it is though, you're going to take a little hit on the performance and hit
[00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:11.680]   on battery life. And that's the trade off. But so in my review, I talked about what I use it for.
[00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:18.480]   I use it for office, right? Which is recompiled for ARM. So office, Word, OneNote, Excel. I use
[00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:24.400]   Slack. I use Teams. I use Skype. I use GroupMe. I use to do. I use the new edge browser, which has
[00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:31.760]   been recompiled for ARM 64. I use Hulu, Netflix, Sling, Disney Plus. I use it as a PWA.
[00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:37.760]   So I do all this stuff and it runs perfectly fine. It's designed for those apps. And if that's
[00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:42.480]   what you're going to use, you're going to be fine. So Slack is electron. Are all electron apps
[00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:48.800]   recompiled for ARM? They will be. So electron actually did get converted to ARM 64. But I don't
[00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:52.240]   think the store app has been updated for that. But that happened over the summer. So that's good.
[00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:54.800]   This is because there are a lot of electron apps out there.
[00:24:54.800 --> 00:25:00.080]   Yep. And Unity too, which is a forum for ARM. So you're seeing this. It's about the ecosystem
[00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:05.280]   building up. And so this device is really about sort of getting it out there and sort of driving
[00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:10.000]   it. But yeah, it depends on that one app, right? I know a lot of people are like, Oh, I need a
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:16.400]   Adobe Lightroom or something. Lightroom doesn't run well on a 10 core Intel.
[00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:22.400]   Right. Yeah. And that's where I feel like this is the issue that PCs have, which is
[00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:28.720]   the beauty of a PC is it can do anything technically. You can run like I have these little mini PCs
[00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:33.280]   with the little seven inch displays. I could install Adobe on that a lot too. Does it run well?
[00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:37.920]   That's a separate question, right? And everybody has a different threshold. Some people are happy
[00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:42.640]   with the Surface goes performance. A lot of people aren't. Whereas a Mac doesn't really have this
[00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:47.200]   much variation. And so that's the issue is when people look at the servers Pro X, they're like,
[00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:51.040]   Oh, I'm going to do everything on that because it's a Windows 10 PC. And there's like, there's
[00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:55.600]   occasional caveats, right? So if you want to game on it, it's terrible. You don't want to game
[00:25:55.600 --> 00:26:00.000]   on this thing. But no gamer would buy an X just I mean, that's crazy talk. You'd be amazed though.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:05.680]   This is again, the thing with PCs, people are like, can I install? Yeah, call of duty on this.
[00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:12.240]   It's like really? But I would say project X cloud, right? We know project X cloud was
[00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:16.880]   announced this week. It's coming to Windows PC. This is the streaming version of
[00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:22.320]   Xbox gaming. So the all the work is done not on your computer, but on the server. Right.
[00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:27.360]   And I know internally they're testing it on the Pro X. They don't expect people to go buy a Pro
[00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:31.600]   X to use this. But at the same time, they say it's a really nice experience if you do do that. So
[00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:36.080]   that's coming in early 2020. You can stream your Xbox games, play call of duty on it. It's at a
[00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:40.560]   solution for all people, probably not is a solution for some people. Yeah, totally. Actually,
[00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:44.320]   it's going to be a really interesting alternative that gets around this where you still can carry
[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:49.040]   around a laptop that weighs two pounds and gets all day battery life.
[00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:53.600]   Should Apple, which has been rumored to be going to arm should Apple be watching this experience
[00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:59.040]   closely? They're in a little bit better position because of the fact that they manifest well,
[00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:06.000]   they designed their own. Yeah. And those their chips are really impressive and probably and
[00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:12.400]   they're all 64 bit. Yeah. And they have the iOS ecosystem, right? And the iPad,
[00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:16.880]   iOS ecosystem. So in that sense, they're a little bit better position. Their issues,
[00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:25.120]   they need to get their stuff. So it's more like a PC instead of iPhone apps on the larger screen.
[00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:29.280]   So they're coming from a different problem where Microsoft's trying to get their stuff a little bit
[00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:34.160]   more like iPhone apps, casual games and all this kind of stuff. So they're both coming from
[00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:38.640]   different areas. But yeah, I mean, the industry's moving to arm, right? At least I like it that
[00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:43.440]   we're in an industry for a long time. Intel was so dominant. That's all you had. Now we've got arm,
[00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:50.640]   now we've got AMD back in the game. I think that's good. Yeah. AMD is expected to have a really strong
[00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:56.320]   for, you know, 2020. Yes, they're going to add some really nice stuff. They've got a new 4,000
[00:27:56.320 --> 00:28:01.760]   chip for laptops. Go ahead. I'm sorry. No, no, no, it's fine. I was just going to say, I think
[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:07.760]   Microsoft is a really interesting position with their streaming service. If you look at Google
[00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:14.560]   Stadia, which I got tomorrow this year, yeah, they've got 15 games announced for it. I
[00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:19.520]   probably shouldn't say this by friends of mine on the Xbox team and they saw Stadia when they came
[00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:24.480]   out and the lineup for it, they're working on Microsoft streaming solution. They're like,
[00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:31.040]   whoa, all right. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, because games drive these platforms and there's nothing.
[00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:36.000]   Of course it does. And I will be honest, you're making fun of it, but I'm the exact kind of person.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:41.280]   I'm like, if I'm buying a Windows machine, I want steam because there's a limit to how many games
[00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:47.440]   I can get to work on Mac. The Surface X, Surface Pro X, I thought was the most interesting device
[00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:52.960]   to come out of that Surface event. The hardware looks great. The device looks great. I got the
[00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:58.240]   Surface Go and I took it back because I'm like, there are too many compromises with speed on this.
[00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:03.360]   Exactly. So if you look at Xbox, it's got the infrastructure there to really bring forward
[00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:10.080]   a streaming solution that works on those kinds of devices. So I'm thinking about where Microsoft
[00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:15.760]   is going to be five, six years from now. And I can really imagine they're streaming Xbox game
[00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:21.600]   service working well enough that you could say, okay, I can move to ARM, I can get that battery life
[00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:26.960]   and I can place it when I need to do that. I just think it's really looking very prominent.
[00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:32.000]   So as a game developer, you're picking X Cloud X, whatever the hell it's called.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.760]   All the way. All the way. All the way. Overstadia, over any. And PlayStation,
[00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:40.240]   they bought Guy Kai, they've got a streaming solution too, right?
[00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:44.320]   It's not very good. The colors are off. It's still off a little bit with us.
[00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:50.240]   The colors are off. Look at it. The browns are very enhanced. It's more muddy than a lot of games.
[00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:54.160]   If you look at PlayStation now. Does that have to do with the streaming technology? Why is that?
[00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:59.760]   I assume it's like looking at a game through a filter. Like if you haven't cleaned your glasses,
[00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:04.320]   it's just it's off. It's weird. So Cloud X is going to be the way to go.
[00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:08.640]   I think it has the most potential. It'll be the last one to come out.
[00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:14.560]   Yeah. And what I hear from game developers over and over, I think about from their point of view,
[00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:20.400]   you're asking like an Ubisoft can go and say, okay, we're going to spend a couple million dollars
[00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:26.080]   porting over Assassin's Creed Odyssey to this because we're freaking Ubisoft, right? And it's a game
[00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:33.040]   that already exists. But if you're asking a developer to bet on a platform when Google has such a
[00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:39.360]   long history of just destroying platforms in a very short amount of time, that's not something
[00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:44.960]   a lot of game developers are going to do. If you're talking about Xbox streaming, it's still x86.
[00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:49.920]   I assume it's going to work with the same tools. If you're doing Xbox development,
[00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:53.680]   it just it's easier for the game to have pipeline. It's an easier sell.
[00:30:53.680 --> 00:31:00.480]   Brianna, yeah. Do we this is completely jumping back to Stadia, but do we know why they're going
[00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:05.920]   ahead with the launch? If everything the free and about the games, like every like the controllers
[00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:10.160]   aren't working, Stadia Connect isn't going to be part of the launch. Cloud plays got what why
[00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:13.280]   why are they going ahead if they could just cause their Google?
[00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:15.040]   Right. That's it.
[00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:23.520]   Everything's in beta. I think they don't understand like gamers expect a reasonably polished experience
[00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:28.480]   on if not day one, then close to it. It's exactly like you said, the controls are a mess.
[00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:34.240]   No, let's be fair. Yeah. In the last five years, every massive triple A title has come out,
[00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:39.920]   been horribly buggy. The servers have crashed. I mean, I think gamers might be a little bit more
[00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:45.040]   used to failure on day one than you say, but not with the system itself. If you're going and buying
[00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:50.160]   a switch on day one, you had a certain number of titles that you could play and enjoy PlayStation
[00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:55.360]   three, PlayStation four. You expect that when you go plunk down that amount of money, the buy-in is
[00:31:55.360 --> 00:32:00.880]   less for Stadia, but it's not even about it's not even about who buys it. It's about getting buy-in
[00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:05.600]   from the developers. Yeah, I literally have never met a game developer in my life that's like,
[00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:08.480]   you know, I'm betting my company on Stadia. Yeah.
[00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:12.080]   That's not happening. Yeah, there's just too much competition. There's also, let's not forget,
[00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:16.720]   there's Apple and you can make money in an iOS game pretty good, pretty easy.
[00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:21.120]   Arcade is great, isn't it? And you can play that on your Apple TV.
[00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:27.680]   I think Google's issue also was just the way the messaging came out for this. So they announced it.
[00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:33.440]   And I met when they announced it, I was like, ooh, you know, like, this could be a big deal, you know,
[00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:36.080]   but then what happened was the details came out. Yeah.
[00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:42.400]   We're next few months. Little bits are trickling out. Oh, you know, only 15 titles. Oh, it won't
[00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:48.000]   work on this hardware initially. Oh, it only works on the Pixel 3. And so all the, oh, and it won't
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:53.200]   work on your PC, like all these little, like, and so the story got worse and worse and worse.
[00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:57.840]   And that's usually not the way you want to do any kind of announcement, right? So it was about
[00:32:57.840 --> 00:33:02.320]   expectations. And I think expectations were a little bit of a mystery when it first announced
[00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:06.000]   a bit, but it looked pretty positive. And then as we got closer and closer to launch,
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   there's just like one let down after another. Now they can still recoup from this. I think this
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:13.280]   is still early days, but, you know, I think we're in us right here. I mean, in fact,
[00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:17.280]   as Microsoft's been thinking this, we started reporting on them doing cloud streaming and
[00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:21.520]   experimenting with it in 2013. That was our first story on it. So they've been, they've been
[00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:27.600]   thinking about this for a really long time and architecting it. And when they tied into the Xbox
[00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:33.120]   Game Pass and the low cost of entry and the options where you can stream from your console or from
[00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:39.360]   their cloud, you know, it does have sort of a better story, I think. And they have Azure around
[00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:44.480]   the world. They're just kind of set up for this. But, you know, I want Google to actually kind of
[00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:48.960]   do well here because I want to see the competition, you know, go back and forth. I think gamers
[00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:54.320]   want that as well as consumers will benefit from it. But right now, Stadia looks a little bit
[00:33:55.040 --> 00:34:02.320]   disappointing. Sometimes I almost feel like these are more demos for the cloud infrastructure that
[00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:07.600]   Google and Microsoft can offer than the actual gaming experience. It's like, oh, no, we can do,
[00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:14.240]   you know, scalable, massive networks look. And it's really, it almost feels like CloudX and
[00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:20.960]   other things are just a show off for Azure, as opposed to kind of, I mean, in a sense, they are.
[00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:25.600]   I mean, because I want to be surprised if Microsoft ends up selling Azure to other companies.
[00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:28.800]   There's even a talk with Sony that they would help power Sony.
[00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:34.160]   I think Apple's using it too. I mean, Azure is, yeah. Actually, we'll get into that because
[00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:40.960]   there's some little fight going on over Jedi, which we'll get to in just a little bit.
[00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:44.800]   And I do, you know, I'm glad because we have, you know, Bran is a game developer going way
[00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:48.640]   back. So we have Bran as expertise. Does Stadia comes out tomorrow though, doesn't it?
[00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:53.920]   Is that right? I bought, did you get your premier edition yet, Karsten? Did it come yet?
[00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:58.160]   It has not come yet. Mine is not either. Is it going to come tomorrow?
[00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:04.160]   They're shipping waves. Yeah. Some people are not actually going to be able to.
[00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:09.120]   But I got the premier first day. Well, if you got it the first day, then it's,
[00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:15.280]   if you ordered it the first day, then it's like, do you did, right? You didn't even order it.
[00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:19.520]   Oh, I thought you did. No, no, I don't, I don't, it's not something I know.
[00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:22.480]   Zach thinks it's stupid. Yeah, Zach thinks it's really stupid.
[00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:29.360]   Yeah. Someone who will have it tomorrow and has had it for several days already is Jason Howell.
[00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:35.040]   So he will have a, so tomorrow. So tomorrow we will have a day one review.
[00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:37.280]   Yes. Of Stadia. Yes, we're going to, of.
[00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:41.280]   First we have hands on tech is going to have a more bandwidth than God in here.
[00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:46.240]   This is not a very good test. This is, this is our 10 gigabit symmetric line. It works great.
[00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:49.760]   Yeah. Hey, you know, I feel bad for men.
[00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:59.200]   You know, cause in most, in most species, it is the male of the species, the peacock that gets the
[00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:03.680]   feathers, the plumage gets to look good, lets it good, looks to fancy. In the human, of all the
[00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:11.600]   species, the human species, men, we don't get much. We wear business suits and white shirts and
[00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:19.680]   we're boring dress. There's only really two ways men can show their plumage. One is with a necktie.
[00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:26.560]   I'm not wearing a necktie. One is with your socks. And I am now of a, I am convinced
[00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:35.680]   that getting a great, fancy, cool looking sock is the key to style for men. That's why I'm a
[00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:42.640]   bomb us subscriber. I love my bomb us socks. Do you know about bomb us? Bomb us make socks that
[00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:49.840]   are super soft, crazy cozy and styling. They look great no matter what the occasion, whether you're
[00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:56.080]   athletic dress or casual socks. They have all kinds, including, and Lisa's saying, I have to try
[00:36:56.080 --> 00:37:01.520]   these. I've never done this. I always like socks that show, but they also have, this is what all the
[00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:07.520]   kids are wearing these days, these no show socks. So you see people wearing loafers and it looks like
[00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:12.000]   they're not wearing socks, they're wearing bomb us. See, no show. You can also get ankle socks. I
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:17.360]   happen to like quarter or even calf socks. I do not wear knee high, but they have those as well.
[00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:22.400]   They're all made from super soft natural cotton. Every pair comes with arch support. Yeah,
[00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:27.600]   when you try your bomb us, they are the most comfortable socks. They are not merely a liner
[00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:34.800]   to keep your foot from touching your shoe. They are a part of the entire shoe architecture,
[00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:41.760]   a seamless toe. So there's no lumps. The cushion footbed is comfy, but not too thick,
[00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:46.480]   but you will notice the difference. I got a 12 pack here, but you can choose singles,
[00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:52.240]   three packs, and even 12 packs with many colors, patterns, lengths, mix and match. They look great
[00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:59.920]   no matter where you are. Guys, we need a way to show our style. And this is how I show my style
[00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:04.480]   with bomb us. Also, great, by the way, great company to give back to their community. The socks
[00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:09.360]   are one of the most important things. If you're homeless, they are the number one most requested
[00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:14.000]   item and homeless shelters for every bomb us purchase you make. They donate a pair to someone
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:20.320]   in need. So this is a great way to give a gift of socks for the holidays and give to others as well.
[00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:28.480]   You can do both. B-O-M-B-A-S, bombus.com/twit. Who knew there was so much tech
[00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:34.880]   in socks, but I could tell you as a bomb us where there is no better sock. You can get 20% off
[00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:43.200]   your purchase right now if you go to bombus.com/twit. 20% off. So buy a lot. Buy a bunch of them.
[00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:49.680]   Give them to friends. Bombus. Thank you, bombus, for your support of this week in tech.
[00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:55.520]   All right. I guess we've talked about I was going to save the Stadia conversation. I guess we've
[00:38:55.520 --> 00:39:03.840]   done it. Last week there was conversation about the apple card being sexist. And actually people
[00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:12.640]   took it seriously. I laughed. I was reading David Hennemire-Hanson's DHS's, DHH's tweet where he said he and his wife
[00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:19.840]   filed for apple cards. And he got a 20 times higher credit limit. And he says it's sexist.
[00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:27.680]   I don't know. I don't know if I buy that. The New York Department of Financial Services is opening
[00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:34.240]   an investigation. Goldman Sachs says it's going to reevaluate credit decisions for those who got
[00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:41.280]   less than they thought. I got to point out Lisa, my wife and I both applied for apple cards. Her
[00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:47.600]   credit limits like twice, three times mine. I didn't tweet. Oh, it's sexist. Women get more credit.
[00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:53.200]   These things are complicated. Is there in the aftermath of this? I know we talked about it last
[00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:59.600]   week, but in the aftermath, this is there any, I mean, apples taking it seriously.
[00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:08.320]   I think the feminist revolution, maybe this is not the biggest priority we have. Maybe I don't know.
[00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:11.680]   It's hashtag more credit. Yeah.
[00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:20.560]   See, remember David Hennemire-Hanson, creator of Ruby, one of the founders of Basecamp is filthy rich.
[00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:27.440]   I mean, really, you should see his car collection. In fact, it blows me away. You can make that
[00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:33.200]   much money in software. I don't know what his wife's credit history is. I think it's more
[00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:39.280]   complicated and nuanced than that. That is a data point of one. Now, was also tweeted.
[00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:46.720]   But again, Wozniak made a little bit of money on apple. His wife Janet, I love Janet.
[00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:55.280]   She came from apple education. I don't take it. The fact that I got less credit than my wife,
[00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:57.520]   I don't take that personally. That's just what you get.
[00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:04.640]   Can I step forward to be the devil's advocate? Yes. Is there something harm? Why would Goldman
[00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:12.400]   Sachs prefer men over women? Give better credit to men? Why would they? Why did Apple partner with
[00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:17.120]   Goldman Sachs in the first place? But, well, I can tell you that the answer to that is Goldman
[00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:21.280]   Sachs has a terrible reputation. They've never done consumer credit. They wanted to get in a
[00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:26.000]   banking. They have an internet banking play called Marcus. So this was a way for them to kind of
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:30.320]   establish their bona fides. Yeah, but except for the fact that, and we can talk about this later,
[00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:33.920]   like Google getting into giving you a checking account and things like that,
[00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:37.920]   they're partnering with somebody in their backyard that's a small, whatever.
[00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:44.080]   The devil's advocate thing is it's about the algorithms. It's about them being black box.
[00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:48.880]   It's about it being opaque. It's about there being potentially bias in the algorithms.
[00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:55.360]   So I guess, I guess, I mean, if I'm a credit card company, I don't put a line
[00:41:55.360 --> 00:42:00.080]   item that says, "Well, if it's a woman, give her less." I say, "Look at her FICO score. Look at all
[00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:04.400]   these factors." And admittedly, it's a black box. There's a lot of factors. But is gender
[00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:08.400]   with gender? Why would you put gender in there? You want to lend money. You're there to give
[00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:15.360]   people credit. Yeah. I feel like there's a longer policy discussion to be had about the way these
[00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:23.040]   algorithms affect us. There's a very popular piece of software used in sentencing for criminal trials.
[00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:27.600]   And studies have shown this does have a bias against people of color.
[00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:33.760]   Okay. But as soon as you said, sensing for criminal software for sentencing,
[00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:36.320]   that's right there. Just right there was a bad idea.
[00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:40.960]   Absolutely. And I'm just saying there's a discussion to be had about how the algorithms
[00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:46.480]   affect our lives. Is this something we want to waste our precious national attention on?
[00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:50.800]   I want to be honest with you, Leah. When you run for office, you have a team that does social
[00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:56.720]   media. I was so disappointed to see my team tweeting about this as if it was a feminist outrage,
[00:42:56.720 --> 00:43:02.400]   because I don't care. Yeah. There's plenty more to worry about, including income disparities and
[00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:12.800]   things like that. Can I point out to her credit, Jamie JHH, his wife, did a blog post where she said,
[00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:16.960]   quote, "This is not merely a story about sexism and credit card algorithm black boxes,
[00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:21.600]   but about how rich people nearly always get their way justice for another rich white woman is not
[00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:25.440]   justice." Oh, yeah. By the way, to their credit, they're aware of that. We should say that that
[00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:31.120]   she was her credit limit was raised as soon as he tweeted about it. Although you can always do
[00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:34.880]   that. I've often appealed my credit limit and got more credit. That's a pretty common
[00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:44.720]   thing. I don't know. I don't know. Is this bad for Apple that they partnered with Goldman Sachs
[00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:50.400]   and this is going on? I think it's just bad that they part of what Goldman Sachs-- Yeah, bad enough.
[00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:59.280]   I just don't like-- I just want banking just to be normal. I feel like banking is sort of like
[00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:04.400]   the cab industry, which it was so bad that it gave rise to Uber and Lyft.
[00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:10.000]   And now we have-- Uber and Lyft solved a lot of problems and spurred innovation,
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:16.640]   but it's also created some other issues too. But the only reason Uber and Lyft were so successful
[00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:21.680]   is because the cab industry was so bad. There's no reason why they couldn't have been doing these
[00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:28.080]   things themselves years ago. They feel like banking's the same way, where the banks just--
[00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:32.880]   really no reason why you need to physically go into a bank anymore and all that kind of stuff.
[00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:38.160]   So you're seeing this rise of just all digital stuff. And I'm okay with that. But now you're
[00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:43.920]   getting into this like-- I don't even understand why there's an Apple credit card or why Google
[00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:49.200]   wants to give me check. There's an answer for that. It's money. Well, of course. Yeah. No,
[00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:53.600]   that's why-- Why in heaven's name would Apple want to make money? What's wrong with that?
[00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:58.160]   But it's like getting into this whole speculation and financial bubble. The whole thing that Goldman
[00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:02.240]   Sacks was like got a bad reputation for it. The mortgage industry.
[00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:05.920]   It was this was inevitable though. This was no matter even if they did it with another bank.
[00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:11.200]   This was inevitable. If you're doing a credit card, you're going to get some blowback.
[00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:16.640]   Yeah. I think that's why it was so surprising to me. I mean, if you think about Apple,
[00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:21.360]   the experience bottom line should be joy. When I go into an Apple store and I buy
[00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:27.120]   the new headphones or a new iPad or something, it should just be an experience of joy.
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:33.360]   And I understand why they did this. Leah, did you know that Sony today, their number one most
[00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:37.760]   profitable division the last time I looked was their financial services division, their number
[00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:43.040]   two month-- Specifically insurance. Yeah. Right. And then it was the PlayStation.
[00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:47.840]   Right. That is what is holding Sony together these days. So I understand Apple--
[00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:53.200]   You have to diversify. You have to. Right. I understand that move. But it just feels so
[00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:59.440]   counter to the emotion. Apple doesn't need the cash. I don't understand why you would take this
[00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:05.840]   kind of hit. I agree with you, except I said exactly the same thing about 15 years ago when
[00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:09.760]   Apple-- There was rumors that Apple was going to make a cell phone. And I said,
[00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:15.040]   why would Apple want to get in that business? That is the worst possible business. Working with
[00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:22.720]   carriers is a terrible idea. What was I wrong? Now, here's another-- I was just going to say
[00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:27.840]   tech though. Like tech, you have innovation and like you go look at the iPhone and what we all got
[00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:32.480]   wrong was we didn't really see how far they were going to push the model really changing.
[00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:38.000]   When it comes to financial services, like, like I mean the reviews for the Apple credit card were
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:44.000]   hilarious. Like people were going off about how the gradient changes in the app. Like this was
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:49.200]   like innovation, like in a sense of like technology or even like the iPhone. So like,
[00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:55.760]   I don't know. I just don't see this as a play for money. But I feel like consumers
[00:46:55.760 --> 00:46:59.760]   are getting more and more pressure for all this kind of stuff. And it's not really making our lives
[00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:06.560]   better. Actually, there were opportunities in FinTech. I think FinTech is like the cab industry,
[00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:10.240]   a place that could really be disintermediated and improved upon. Oh, and by the way, there's
[00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:14.480]   tons of that, Leo. I mean, there's all of these like Robinhood saying like, right,
[00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:17.360]   not even that. There's all those European banks that are coming over here.
[00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:25.520]   Now that are completely, you know, all online. And you know, I'm with you, Daniel. I said on my
[00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:31.040]   show this week that like, sorry guys, I only want to do banking with a bank. Even though I hate my
[00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:36.400]   bank, there's nothing that they do well for me. But I'm going to give my money to a bank.
[00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:44.000]   Because, okay, why does Apple need to do this? They're not in with the data. Why is Google
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:47.680]   interested in giving you a checking account? This is a quote from the Wall Street Journal.
[00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:51.520]   Checking accounts are a commoditized product and people don't switch very often, but they contain
[00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:55.600]   a treasure trove of information, including how much money you make. Where are they shop?
[00:47:55.600 --> 00:48:00.560]   The data, baby. Right. So you want to talk about innovation, the innovation that tech can bring
[00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:07.280]   to things. The innovation that Google wants to bring is again, a checking account. That's nuts.
[00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:13.200]   There's got to be something better. This is 18th century technology. If there's done,
[00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:16.800]   at least I'm sure Google won't make us write checks, or maybe they will. I don't know.
[00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:22.560]   Forget that. They'll probably the innovation will be that you never have to write a check. All they
[00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:27.680]   care about is knowing how much your monthly spend is on entertainment and blah, blah, blah.
[00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:32.800]   It's very easy to look at anything Google does and say, well, it's about the data. They give us
[00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:38.320]   a lot of free services. Look at Google Photos. I'm constantly amazed by what you get from Google
[00:48:38.320 --> 00:48:44.400]   Photos for nothing, including unlimited photos storage. I have 40 or 50,000 photos on there.
[00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:49.760]   But it isn't. But it isn't those photos themselves. That's for their own algorithms and training
[00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:54.880]   and all this. I mean, everything they do, I don't want to hate on Google necessarily,
[00:48:54.880 --> 00:49:01.440]   but everything they do is to benefit them for their larger picture. I know
[00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:04.880]   they're like, and we'll talk about this later. We'll talk about now, but the health stuff with
[00:49:04.880 --> 00:49:11.360]   Google, right? Let's talk about this. Yeah, Project 19 Gale. Yeah. And so this is just another
[00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:18.640]   I don't doubt that they can contribute to the health care industry and use their algorithms and
[00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:24.240]   detecting in x-rays. There's definitely a discussion there where this technology can be helpful.
[00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:29.680]   But let's not forget the fact that Google wants to do this because it benefits them on a larger
[00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:34.640]   scale too. It's a market for them. It's not like, we're going to donate our servers to help
[00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:40.080]   care cancer. This is not the first time, though, that Google has tried to collect health information,
[00:49:40.080 --> 00:49:44.960]   Google Health. And Microsoft did it too with Microsoft Health. Both companies abandoned their
[00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:51.520]   health plans, probably because of privacy issues. Yeah. Microsoft's in it, but they're on the back
[00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:58.320]   end. They want to do electronic records. Yeah. Yeah. With Fitbit, you know, you got Fitbit now,
[00:49:58.320 --> 00:50:02.480]   you got this stuff going on. Now you want to tie your financial data to the
[00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:08.720]   interesting one. Talk about data, Google acquired Fitbit. Yeah. And by the way, in the process,
[00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:14.480]   they get the pebble patents. Yeah. Right. Pebble's not coming back. Come on!
[00:50:16.320 --> 00:50:22.080]   Amazing. I love the pebble crowd. The rebel is called the Rebel, the software that keeps
[00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:29.520]   pebble alive. Yeah. My son still wears his every day. That's so crazy to me. I respect it,
[00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:34.400]   but it's like when those phone users, it's time to move on. Who wants to watch that only tells
[00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:42.320]   the time, Carsten? Come on! There's no market for that. Do you think we should worry if you're a
[00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:48.240]   Fitbit user and who isn't? Who didn't at some point use Fitbit? Should you worry that Google
[00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:53.280]   now has that entire database of health information? Or who cares? I don't care if Google knows how
[00:50:53.280 --> 00:51:00.160]   many steps I took in 2008. It's an interesting discussion. I've been a huge fan of Fitbit,
[00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:05.760]   covering them for years. I've always recommended their stuff. Once this news broke out, I know a
[00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:11.520]   lot of Fitbit users are just dropping it. Yeah. And so, and even I've stopped using it. And it's
[00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:16.720]   an interesting question, right? Because part of me is the concern over to health stuff. I don't
[00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:22.160]   want Google knowing that info. And it's not so much like I'm worried about anything in particular.
[00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:26.320]   Well, that's my question. This comes up a lot on all of our shows,
[00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:31.760]   which is the general thing, in fact, the New York Times today, in its Sunday edition,
[00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:38.720]   could you get the New York Times magazine from my office as a wet grumpy cat on the front and
[00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:42.560]   saying what went wrong with the internet? We had such high hopes for the internet. And Kevin
[00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:47.920]   Roos has a long article about how you just it's a horrible thing. And only people who have money
[00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:53.120]   now can use the internet safely and privately. And we talk about a lot, but in every one of
[00:51:53.120 --> 00:51:58.320]   these cases, I keep saying, well, okay, but there's certainly you can't deny there's a lot of benefit.
[00:51:58.320 --> 00:52:06.000]   There it is. Online cesspool got you down. And there's a bunch of grumpy cats, grumpy wet cats.
[00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:09.840]   With I don't know what's on them. And it doesn't look healthy.
[00:52:09.840 --> 00:52:17.200]   It's a German. No, sorry. Yeah, I don't I don't quite get what they're going with with that
[00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:22.400]   photo illustration. But I think it's mine. What? Oh, let's say it's mud. Let's just say it's mud.
[00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:27.280]   Leo, can I tell you about area policy? I've been looking at a lot. Yes, you're you know,
[00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:29.840]   you're going to be on the front line. It is when you get elected to Congress.
[00:52:29.840 --> 00:52:36.560]   So I had when you run for office, you talk to a lot of lawyers. And I've actually, I never
[00:52:36.560 --> 00:52:43.280]   thought about this until a couple of weeks ago. So there's a kind of asymmetrical legal warfare
[00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:48.160]   going on with defense prosecutors where if the government is building up a case against someone,
[00:52:48.160 --> 00:52:53.680]   they have the power to go in subpoena, massive amount of information. A really good example.
[00:52:53.680 --> 00:53:00.480]   Let's say a mugging takes place in a park. They can go like cast a geo fence and subpoena Google
[00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:04.400]   and get the information of every single Gmail account that was in that park.
[00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:10.240]   That's okay. You're right. There's a bad one. So, and I'm just like, we brought up Project Night
[00:53:10.240 --> 00:53:15.280]   and Gale. I also talked to a doctor this week that told me, spent 45% of his day doing
[00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:21.440]   electronic paperwork on his patients. They felt every single system we'd ever used was broken.
[00:53:21.440 --> 00:53:26.640]   And he wanted to see some unification and improvement there, which Project Night and Gale could do.
[00:53:26.640 --> 00:53:31.360]   That's a good thing. On the bad side of this, you look at this and you're like,
[00:53:31.360 --> 00:53:36.400]   okay, if Google has all this information from Fitbit, does that mean they could eventually trade
[00:53:36.400 --> 00:53:41.280]   this to your insurance companies? Theoretically illegal now, maybe it's not going to be illegal
[00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:47.120]   10 years from now. What if there's a case of the government building a criminal case against you
[00:53:47.120 --> 00:53:54.320]   or a civil case? So, I'm just saying all this stuff has very wide ramifications that we've never
[00:53:54.320 --> 00:54:00.400]   really had a discussion about in this country. And I agree we need to have the conversation,
[00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:04.960]   and I agree we need more members of Congress like you who have technical literacy so that they can
[00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:09.680]   intelligently talk about this. I think there's also a risk though, just to say, oh, big tech is bad.
[00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:15.600]   We've just got to throw that out because we think there's real benefits too. And just aggregate,
[00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:18.880]   I just signed up for Apple's health research thing they released this week.
[00:54:18.880 --> 00:54:25.840]   And you can do a hearing study, a heart study, and I think there's a study for women on menstrual
[00:54:25.840 --> 00:54:31.200]   cycles. And you contribute data, there's a whole big thing you have to agree to. But I did it,
[00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:36.000]   not because I think it's valuable to collect this data and to make get insights from it. I'm not
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:44.160]   worried about somebody, I even, I think this is good, right? Is it that we trust Apple to do this?
[00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:49.760]   And not Google? I mean, Apple has stated. I don't think Apple's necessarily more trustworthy than
[00:54:49.760 --> 00:54:55.120]   Google. Yeah, but Daniel said that Google is doing this for their own interests. Well,
[00:54:55.120 --> 00:55:00.320]   Apple's doing everything for their own interests too. It's just that you, we are Apple's customers.
[00:55:00.320 --> 00:55:05.120]   The problem with Google is we're never their customers. The advertisers are always their
[00:55:05.120 --> 00:55:10.480]   customers. So in a way, this Google story with the health records, it's almost like the quintessential
[00:55:10.480 --> 00:55:15.520]   tech story at the moment because, oh, the rap on Google is all they ever do is their tech is only
[00:55:15.520 --> 00:55:19.600]   to serve ads to you, right? All the great things they give you is only to serve ads. So here's an
[00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:25.360]   example of them saying, look, health is a huge societal issue. Health care, let's make it cheaper,
[00:55:25.360 --> 00:55:30.240]   let's digitize it. So on the one hand, you want to be like, congratulations, Google, you're finally,
[00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:33.600]   you're doing something that's really going to put it down in the universe. But then on the other
[00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:38.800]   hand, you're like, but is are you only ever going to do this not for us because we're not your
[00:55:38.800 --> 00:55:43.120]   customers? You're really going to do it for your real customers, which are always the advertisers
[00:55:43.120 --> 00:55:46.640]   and the marketers and all that stuff. So that's the issue.
[00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:52.720]   So here's the problem is there's somebody at Google who has, you know, wants to make the world a
[00:55:52.720 --> 00:55:56.960]   better place. And I suspect there are thousands of employees and even management people at Google
[00:55:56.960 --> 00:56:00.400]   who do want to make the world a better place. They just, that's it. You shouldn't be working at
[00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:05.360]   Google because of your business model. They have, I mean, I do have an image problem, right? I mean,
[00:56:05.360 --> 00:56:09.840]   we're just scale this right now. Who's at the bottom? It's Facebook, right? Like if Facebook
[00:56:09.840 --> 00:56:15.600]   got on to help, I think we'd all agree that's a bet. Yeah, right. So you got Facebook and then
[00:56:15.600 --> 00:56:19.600]   Google's above them. I would say Google is not nearly as bad as Facebook, but their reputation
[00:56:19.600 --> 00:56:23.840]   is not so great here for their reasons, you know, that just outlines. And then you have like
[00:56:23.840 --> 00:56:28.800]   Microsoft and Apple, who aren't angels? They too have screw ups, but it seems like their interest
[00:56:28.800 --> 00:56:32.880]   is a little bit different. And so I think that is a gradient, but it's, you know, what Brianna was
[00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:37.440]   talking about too, we really haven't had this discussion about data. I'd also say Google has,
[00:56:37.440 --> 00:56:43.040]   you know, part of their history. So like, first of all, it's called Project Night and Gail. I think
[00:56:43.040 --> 00:56:47.840]   anytime you call anything a project and it's secret and then it leaks out in the media,
[00:56:47.840 --> 00:56:52.720]   it's just not good. And don't forget, Google is just reeling right now from their other project,
[00:56:52.720 --> 00:56:58.960]   the Chinese search engine that they were allegedly working on. And so was that dragonfly, I think
[00:56:58.960 --> 00:57:04.320]   it was. So when you have all these like secret projects and it comes out, it just sounds sketchy,
[00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:09.360]   even if it may not be. And so, but we need to have this discussion about data protection. We have
[00:57:09.360 --> 00:57:13.520]   HIPAA, which is really nice because it does. Google's not a signature to HIPAA.
[00:57:13.520 --> 00:57:19.680]   But Fitbit is. And so like, and that's like, so I suppose they're going to inherit that, but like,
[00:57:19.680 --> 00:57:25.760]   we need to talk about the stuff, who controls the data and who sells it, all this. And I don't
[00:57:25.760 --> 00:57:30.800]   know, it's just, I would feel better. I don't feel safe putting myself with Google. Now for any
[00:57:30.800 --> 00:57:34.720]   specific reason either. But my other issue with like them and Fitbit, I just don't trust them as
[00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:40.240]   a company to maintain the hardware. Like I liked Fitbit's hardware. I liked what they were doing.
[00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:42.720]   And I feel like Google was just, I don't know what they're going to do with this stuff. Like,
[00:57:42.720 --> 00:57:49.840]   WearOS is a mess. So some of the problem Google has is not about privacy or selling advertising,
[00:57:49.840 --> 00:57:56.640]   but just about their kind of. Management. Failure to, to, to, you know, pursue these projects to their
[00:57:56.640 --> 00:58:02.800]   end. Flakiness. I'm just freaking this. That's a better word. Flakiness. Flakiness. Okay.
[00:58:03.520 --> 00:58:08.880]   Yeah, they're flakiness. Like Fitbit line will just fizzle out. And I feel the same way like
[00:58:08.880 --> 00:58:12.560]   people were like, well, Microsoft should buy Fitbit. Like that same issue. Like I don't,
[00:58:12.560 --> 00:58:17.840]   I don't trust Microsoft to maintain Fitbit's business. Right. And I don't know who would
[00:58:17.840 --> 00:58:22.720]   have been good for this. I would have actually preferred Apple to buy Fitbit if only because
[00:58:22.720 --> 00:58:28.240]   Apple, I feel like could really benefit benefit from the health. Would you trust government to do it?
[00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:33.200]   That's do all the time. Right. Right. You see as a massive,
[00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:37.200]   a fun thing. So this is the problem is I don't think we trust anybody. And yet there are benefits
[00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:42.240]   to aggregating this information and, and creating databases and figuring stuff out.
[00:58:42.240 --> 00:58:47.840]   So there's, I mean, are you just going to lose it all because you just don't trust anybody to
[00:58:47.840 --> 00:58:52.400]   hold all this information? I think the issue with government is more about our general distrust
[00:58:52.400 --> 00:58:56.960]   in institutions. It's really been spanning for the last 20 years and even going back to Reagan.
[00:58:56.960 --> 00:59:01.200]   But if you look now at the current administration, there's like anti intellectualism that's been
[00:59:01.200 --> 00:59:07.440]   going on. We don't trust people in government to talk coherently about these topics because
[00:59:07.440 --> 00:59:14.160]   they're just not first. And yet the CDC does great important vital work. Oh, yeah.
[00:59:14.160 --> 00:59:18.080]   The people that work in those institutions know what to do. Well, I would say the same thing
[00:59:18.080 --> 00:59:23.440]   about Google. You know, I mean, this is the problem is if we don't trust any institutions,
[00:59:23.440 --> 00:59:30.080]   yeah, fine anarchy. But I think there's a benefit that we can go ahead,
[00:59:30.080 --> 00:59:36.240]   Rana. No, I was just going to say, I ultimately, I think the answer here is we've got to have
[00:59:36.240 --> 00:59:41.200]   regulation about who can collect what and how they could use it. If I remember correctly,
[00:59:41.200 --> 00:59:45.520]   Leon, for the health study you were talking about, when Apple got on stage and they were talking
[00:59:45.520 --> 00:59:49.840]   about they were talking about how they're going to use their differential privacy technology
[00:59:49.840 --> 00:59:54.720]   to aggregate the total conclusions that they're going to draw, which means they split up the end
[00:59:54.720 --> 01:00:00.720]   in the beginnings. You can't track any one data to any individual user when they are drawing
[01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:05.600]   conclusions. That makes sense to me. So I think ultimately, if we're trying to say,
[01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:10.480]   well, do we trust Microsoft? Do we trust Google? Do we trust Facebook? It's a losing argument.
[01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:16.240]   We need regulation that protects citizens. And then that is an overall strategy for this,
[01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:20.720]   rather than being at the mercy of Facebook and Google and Microsoft.
[01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:24.160]   Well, maybe that is the solution. The same solution the founders came up with,
[01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:29.840]   with separation of powers. Maybe that's the solution is that you do have private history,
[01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:35.680]   but you have government watching. If mutual oversight.
[01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:40.000]   For all the things that you dislike about government, at least in theory, government is
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:48.240]   accountable. A key point that I want to make here from the journal, I think it was that
[01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:54.160]   brought this out is neither patience nor doctors have been informed that Google has this data.
[01:00:54.160 --> 01:01:02.080]   Because it comes from some, a central Catholic chain of 2600 hospitals, blah, blah, blah.
[01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:05.920]   But apparently that's legal. So they- Well, there you go.
[01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:12.240]   Right. Under the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996, hospitals can
[01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:16.880]   share data with business partners without telling patients as long as the information is only used
[01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:22.400]   to help the covered entity carry out its healthcare functions. So- By the way, that law was written
[01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:27.120]   to benefit health insurance companies, clearly. That's what it's all about. That was what that
[01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:30.960]   was all about is that health insurance companies needed to collect all this data so they could
[01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:37.600]   know who to deny coverage to. So let's be clear. Maybe that's not the best law ever.
[01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:45.760]   But also to Daniel's point, it doesn't look good if no one, your doctor or you knows that Google
[01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:50.160]   NASA's the state of- Right. Look at this National Institute of National Institute of Health,
[01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:56.640]   which gave an NIH, which gave 100,000 chest x-ray images to Google, including in some cases,
[01:01:56.640 --> 01:02:04.160]   identifying information on those films. Google's decided not to take it. There were two days
[01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:10.080]   before they were going to publicly post it. They got a call from the NIH saying, "Yeah,
[01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:18.400]   maybe we better cancel that." So yeah, I would hate to lose the benefit of this stuff too. We need
[01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:23.360]   to find a way to regulate it. I think the regulation, I mean, as Brian was saying,
[01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:28.080]   government for all its flaws is technically accountable. If you don't pay attention to it,
[01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:33.280]   it gets away. You do have lobbying and interest, even like HIPAA, as you pointed out. But in theory,
[01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:37.680]   we could organize petition the government and they could fix things. And it's really the only
[01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:43.920]   solution. I know people like to use this argument with Google like, "Well, it's a free market.
[01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:46.960]   Just don't give them your business." But when you're- You don't have a choice.
[01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:53.040]   Yeah. I mean, Google's one, giving away the product for free. And you don't have much choice
[01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:58.800]   than somebody doing know what they're doing. It's hard to be that consumer who's making a
[01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:05.120]   decision to- I don't know. It's a very complicated world. It's like saying, "I'm going to boycott
[01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:09.440]   Disney." It's like- Right. It's a complicated world. It's a complicated world. That's the best
[01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:15.120]   synopsis of this whole problem, and the government is not designed to handle this fast-paced,
[01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:21.040]   very complex issue. What sort of a monster would say they would boycott Disney?
[01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:26.560]   Disney. I am boycotting Disney+, I will not pay for it. I don't care.
[01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:31.680]   I'm not going to watch The Mandalorian. I guess I can live without The Mandalorian.
[01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:38.960]   I already have four years of it. You bought four years. I bought three years because they had a deal
[01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:46.160]   for Disney insiders that- If you're already a Disney insider, there's a problem.
[01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:50.240]   Basically, buy two years, get one free. Disney insiders basically stepford wife.
[01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:52.320]   Yes. Well, I was married there.
[01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:58.160]   Was married in Disneyland. Disney World. They have their own wedding pavilion.
[01:03:58.160 --> 01:04:07.120]   Verizon is giving- You're a Disney stepford wife as well. Verizon is giving all their subscribers.
[01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:10.240]   The next three years, so that's how you got four. Yeah.
[01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:13.840]   Well, I'm more for Verizon. Two years for the price of two years.
[01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:20.000]   Good news about probably that though is I don't- Why I like about Disney+, it's like $6.99.
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:25.280]   And if you tie it to Hulu, it's even cheaper. But I don't trust they're not going to raise the price
[01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:28.880]   soon. I bet it's going to be like $12 or $13 within two years.
[01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:31.840]   Actually, let's take a break because I need to take a break. But I would like to talk about all
[01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:36.320]   these new streaming services. Before the show, we were kind of going back and forth about it.
[01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:41.040]   Let's put it in the show because it's getting expensive and lots of choices
[01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:47.120]   out there. Our show today brought to you by ExpressVPN. You know, I just saw a story that said Apple's
[01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:52.080]   going to warn you when you join an open Wi-Fi network and say, "Do you want to turn on the VPN?
[01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:56.960]   You should have ExpressVPN on your iPhone." I did on my MacBook, on my iPhone, on my Windows
[01:04:56.960 --> 01:05:01.040]   machine, on my Android device was. We were traveling around the world. We were using a lot of open Wi-Fi.
[01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:05.760]   Absolutely. You better believe I pressed that button. That's a nice thing about ExpressVPN.
[01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:11.280]   Those apps have a big button. You press it. You're covered. You're secure. You're private. You're
[01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:19.840]   on the best VPN service. There is ExpressVPN. There are a lot of reasons you want to use a VPN.
[01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:24.400]   I know this audience, I shouldn't have to explain to you. There's all sorts of ways
[01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:30.560]   Wi-Fi security can be bypassed. There's all sorts of ways people can attack your system.
[01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:36.320]   If you're on an open Wi-Fi access point, flaws like crack, there's privacy issues too.
[01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:40.320]   Your internet service provider, many internet service providers, sell information about what
[01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:47.280]   sites you're visiting to the highest bidder. Some even inject ads into your Wi-Fi stream.
[01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:52.480]   ExpressVPN blocks all of that. Number one VPN provider, according to tech radar,
[01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:58.160]   according to CNET, it's very easy to use, very affordable. In fact, we've got an extra special
[01:05:58.160 --> 01:06:03.920]   deal. If you subscribe for one year, you'll get three extra months free at expressvpn.com/toit.
[01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:10.240]   I tested it out. I brought it with me everywhere. They just completed an audit by a third party
[01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:15.520]   that said, "Yes, ExpressVPN does exactly what they say they do in the privacy policy. They do not
[01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:21.520]   log." In fact, they use a technology that makes it impossible for them to log. It's called Trusted
[01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:26.800]   Server. They created it. Those VPN servers you're logging into all around the world are running in
[01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:33.520]   RAM. No data logs can even be written to the hard drive, even by accident. There's no way to keep
[01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:39.280]   track of what you're doing in ExpressVPN. That's what you want. Real privacy. I'm a big fan of
[01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:45.200]   ExpressVPN. I think you should give it a try. If you're not using a VPN, even Apple these days
[01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:51.040]   is going to start saying, "This is in the new beta." You ought to be using a VPN. Turn it on.
[01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:55.440]   Nice thing about ExpressVPN. As soon as you install it on your iPhone, it knows.
[01:06:55.440 --> 01:07:02.000]   It'll turn it on when you want. ExpressVPN.com/toit to get started. Get those three extra months
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:09.840]   free when you buy a one-year package. ExpressVPN. I'm really happy to have them as a partner on this
[01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:14.560]   week in tech. Brianna, which streaming services are you going to subscribe to?
[01:07:14.560 --> 01:07:22.560]   I'm the world's biggest homeland fan. I'm sure it's my favorite one. HBO for John Oliver.
[01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:30.800]   Netflix, obviously. I am married to a Rick and Morty fan. How much do you pay a month? That's crazy.
[01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:36.080]   I'm not sure. What else? Do you not have a cable? You don't have cable, though.
[01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:39.760]   We don't. We cancel cable. Who do you get your internet from a cable company?
[01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:46.080]   We have Thias, which is fine. They get you anyway. Yeah, definitely. But yeah,
[01:07:46.080 --> 01:07:53.440]   CBS, I'm married to a big Star Trek fan. I'm one too. It adds up very quickly.
[01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:58.400]   You're going to get Disney Plus? I've already got it. I'm all in on the Cassian
[01:07:58.400 --> 01:08:04.080]   and Endor series coming out soon. How about Apple TV Plus? You should ask what she didn't
[01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:09.040]   subscribe to. Yeah, that would have been a shorter answer. Don't I subscribe? I don't know if there
[01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:18.560]   is one. Yeah, I got nothing. Stars? Stars? You don't get stars? Yeah. You will.
[01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:25.200]   Eventually. Because it comes down to having a killer show. Is that what it comes down to?
[01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:33.520]   Yeah. I mean, I would pay $100 a month for Homeland. I love that show. So as soon as it goes off
[01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:38.480]   the air, I'm never going to subscribe again. But don't. Well, that's what drives Showtime and HBO
[01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:44.080]   and all the others crazy. Yeah. And what drives them to try to find the next big thing.
[01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:49.840]   Now the Game of Thrones is over. HBO is going, I guess, watch it. I'm surprised at the discipline
[01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:56.000]   and some people who just sign up for a few weeks or a few months to watch a series and then
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:01.680]   you know, basically cancel their account. Like I'm impressed by that. Like, I'm way too lazy to
[01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:07.920]   do it. Yeah. And they know that. That's why they auto renew. They know you'll never be proposal.
[01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:13.440]   For Hulu, I'm in on the, like, you can't go higher than I have for Hulu. Like, I paid now
[01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:17.360]   apparently like 60 bucks a month for Hulu. But you're getting not just Hulu though. You're
[01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:22.800]   getting that the television service. The live TV, the cloud reporting, the commercial free,
[01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:26.720]   which isn't really commercial free. It just allows you to fast forward through the commercials,
[01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:33.360]   which I appreciate. That said, the reason I stick with Hulu is because they're supported
[01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:38.960]   everywhere, whether it's phone, their web app is very good. They make a PWA now, which works
[01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:45.680]   exceptionally well. It's on Xbox. And so I can watch it wherever I am, basically. So even in my
[01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:50.880]   home office here, if news is breaking, I'll just open up the Hulu app and watch on my computer
[01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:56.560]   while multitasking. Sling was also good, but I found Hulu's streaming technology to be better.
[01:09:56.560 --> 01:10:00.560]   And so you have to kind of pick and choose it. But yeah, I mean,
[01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:07.200]   it comes down to what these services offer for TV and all this kind of stuff and the quality of it.
[01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:11.280]   Yeah, I liked YouTube TV. I thought it was really good quality.
[01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:17.840]   I like the capabilities. The DVR, you could have six people, each could have their own DVR,
[01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:22.320]   things like that. But then they jumped the price so much I canceled it, then I got in trouble with
[01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:30.720]   my wife. So it's back. We got it. So that's interesting. That is surprising. AT&T's TV now
[01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:35.120]   is raised as price considerably, but that is a struggling service.
[01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:38.960]   That's also the one that they swore they would not when they
[01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:44.560]   they would not raise the price when they were trying to get to Congress. That's a common thing.
[01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:52.240]   And also there's the whole AT&T time order HBO Max thing is going to replace the theoretically.
[01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:55.520]   So maybe they don't even care about that anymore. They now have it. Maybe it's one of those things
[01:10:55.520 --> 01:10:59.360]   where it's like they cancel you unless they think you're making money on them. Right.
[01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:07.520]   Well, HBO Max is not going to be their TV now. Right. Right. No, I know it's different.
[01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:12.480]   So when do consumers say enough? Or will they ever? Will they just keep buying them all?
[01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:19.920]   They we can find it's like the same old game. I mean, before we had streaming services, it was like
[01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:27.200]   which Byzantine cable plan am I going to sign up for? Do I want to watch EAT? I want ESPN?
[01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:32.640]   I mean, you're paying the same amount of money, at least now I can focus in on the shows that I want
[01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:36.560]   and cancel it without spending an hour on the phone with the phone. It feels to me like we're in a
[01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:40.640]   bubble though of some kind. Like there's too many shows, there's too much to watch.
[01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:46.720]   I feel like people are just going to say enough and they're just going to stop watching TV entirely.
[01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:52.160]   Absolutely. But there's no way that we're all going to be signed up for six services, right?
[01:11:52.160 --> 01:11:57.200]   So it is going to there's going to be a huge washout within the next few winners and losers.
[01:11:57.200 --> 01:12:01.520]   Okay. Right. Right. Right. So then, you know, yeah, yeah, somebody's going to go back to just being
[01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:05.520]   the feeder to the Netflix's and the Disney's and whoever comes out on top or whatever.
[01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:10.880]   Actually, to me, the most interesting thing about this is that as we're all talking about these
[01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:18.640]   subscription services, like there's a huge play that in streaming and it's still ad supported.
[01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:24.080]   So you've got. That drives me nuts. I feel like if I'm paying you, you should not be putting ads.
[01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:29.280]   But see, like that's that's why is it peacock or it's one of those it's either Comcast or NBC's
[01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:32.880]   play that that's just going to be the thing where it's like, well, whatever, we're not.
[01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:40.000]   We might not charge you because right, right, right. No, but so it'll just be another app that's
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:44.720]   on your phone, whatever. It's an ad supported. Exactly network like this, like it's like it's
[01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:50.240]   podcast. So what it used to be like Hulu used to be. Right. So what if what if how it all shakes
[01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:56.160]   out in five years is that there's three or maybe even two big subscription players.
[01:12:56.160 --> 01:13:01.600]   And then everybody else has essentially cable channels, but they're just all apps because they're
[01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:07.440]   ad supported or whatever. And that's essentially it shakes back down to what all we've really
[01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:13.040]   replaced. It used to be HBO, Showtime, Cinemax, and now it's going to just be Netflix. And then
[01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:15.520]   everything else will be ad supported streaming on the other side.
[01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:24.240]   It's an interesting world. I guess though, that our appetite for content is not diminishing.
[01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:30.800]   It's it's I mean, if anything going on better, I mean, I like this. I'd rather have this problem
[01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:34.400]   than just have a single cable company in my town. And that's you're right.
[01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:39.040]   Because at least now, like, well, this is what everybody was saying. We want a la carte. We don't
[01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:46.560]   want to have to buy 20 channels for the one show. We got it. We got our wish. You can cancel.
[01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:50.240]   You just go online. I can go cancel Hulu right now. They're not going to call me. They're not going
[01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:56.000]   to bug me. I just get canceled. It's done. I could go back to sling and be online in two minutes.
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:00.640]   You know, so I do appreciate that. I think things have gotten better. I'd also say that quality,
[01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:04.880]   the shows have gotten better. Like, you're getting back to Disney Plus. Like, I'm all on all four.
[01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:12.080]   The new Star Wars shows. I think like, and we're getting really good TV now. And so,
[01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:17.360]   I think it's better than the network TV model we had years ago. I agree. And so, I'd rather have this.
[01:14:17.360 --> 01:14:21.840]   They're also spending a lot more money. Apple spent $300 million on the morning show.
[01:14:21.840 --> 01:14:25.600]   What was it? You were saying 16 million in an episode? Yeah. Well, 15 million.
[01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:32.720]   15. So, yeah. I probably shouldn't admit this on your show, Leah. But the thing I spend the most
[01:14:32.720 --> 01:14:38.080]   time off any of my subscriptions watching is YouTube. I pay for YouTube bread, which doesn't
[01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:43.440]   have commercials. And yeah, I was talking to one of the millennials on my staff about this.
[01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:50.320]   And he was saying, you know, it's so hyper segmented that I just don't watch planned TV anymore. And
[01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:55.120]   it makes sense. Like, if you're a car person, you go watch Doug DeMuro. You know, if you like
[01:14:55.120 --> 01:15:00.480]   tech stuff, you're watching, you know, your content or other shows. It's so hyper segmented.
[01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:07.920]   Maybe that's the thing. Maybe really. This is old farts who are discussing Disney Plus versus Hulu.
[01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:12.960]   Because I know, but under 25 that I know watches any of that, they watch YouTube. Period.
[01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:19.040]   Well, I think for parents, Disney is a place where you can feel reasonably sure.
[01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:24.960]   Yeah, nobody trusts the kids stuff on the here here, by the way, that we've had a revolution this
[01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:30.640]   weekend in our household with the Disney Plus. How old are your kids? Five and three.
[01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:36.320]   Oh, you're right in the middle of it. Obviously. Yeah. So actually, that's an interesting change.
[01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:42.080]   It's coming to YouTube. They've they've announced. And this is really, they say it's the FTC making
[01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:49.200]   them do this that if you are a there's if you're a child targeted channel, this will very much
[01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:54.560]   change your advertising model. And if you're a child attractive channel and you have to declare it.
[01:15:54.560 --> 01:16:02.960]   And if and it's up to you to decide, but if you do it wrong, the FTC finds you not YouTube.
[01:16:02.960 --> 01:16:09.360]   So that that is in it response to the problems people have had with YouTube.
[01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:13.600]   Child focused YouTube content that's gathering information about kids,
[01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:18.320]   that's targeting kids, it's doing all sorts of weird content for kids.
[01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:27.600]   I've told this story on my show, you know, Tom, I put on Thomas the train. I come back in 30 minutes
[01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:31.440]   and Thomas is going through a McDonald's drive through and the McDonald's is on fire.
[01:16:31.440 --> 01:16:34.960]   Yeah. And say, what the heck is going on here? It's the recommendation engine.
[01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:39.360]   To this day, my daughter says tries to convince me that YouTube is really good,
[01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:43.760]   Papa. YouTube is really good. I said, you've got the wrong Papa because I this is what I do for a
[01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:49.280]   living is I have to hear about all the horrible things that the YouTube algorithms do every day.
[01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:56.480]   So go on. Sorry. But I like the fire in McDonald's, Papa. I like it. She thought it was exciting.
[01:16:56.480 --> 01:17:00.880]   Well, they yeah, they know what they're doing. Really, that's the bottom line and all this stuff.
[01:17:00.880 --> 01:17:06.320]   Algorithmically, we are we are just little monkeys in a cage, pressing the button for the food.
[01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:07.200]   Yeah. Yeah.
[01:17:08.080 --> 01:17:10.080]   Yeah.
[01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:14.640]   All right. Well, I suspect this is all going to I feel like we're in a bubble. I think it's all
[01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:20.720]   going to change when the 25 year olds are dominant. And and and it's going to be a very different
[01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:26.800]   world. And I think hyper segmenting is a very interesting phrase. Yeah. Because I even remember
[01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:31.200]   a time when you would come to work and everybody would be talking about what Johnny Carson did last
[01:17:31.200 --> 01:17:37.840]   night. Sure. And that's how old I am. And that is that still a little bit like game. I remember
[01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:42.480]   the last episode of Game of Thrones, somebody said, remember this, this is the last time everybody
[01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:48.000]   will be watching the same show and at the same time. That's gone. That's going away.
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:56.080]   Yeah. I think my other concern is the fact that these companies are still combining. So like Hulu
[01:17:57.040 --> 01:18:02.640]   was Hulu and then you know, Disney and Comcast and what you're having is like all these and like
[01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:09.920]   with Hulu, it's like Hulu ESPN plus, which I use because of UFC, which they made a deal there,
[01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:15.600]   which I wasn't happy about. And then and now you have this Disney, you know, streaming service. So
[01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:21.520]   you have all this stuff coming under one roof. And at first I was like, Oh, this may actually
[01:18:21.520 --> 01:18:25.440]   work out because they offered a deal. It's like, Oh, if you're very subscribed to some of these,
[01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:30.400]   we'll give you a discount. I'm like, okay, that's kind of cool. And that was cool right up to Hulu
[01:18:30.400 --> 01:18:35.840]   raised a price by $10, which is like, Oh, that's probably how you're subsidizing the Disney plus
[01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:40.880]   stuff is you're offering it so low by jacking up the Hulu cost. And I feel like this is going to be
[01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:45.360]   this cat and mouse game. So it's always good as a when there's actual competition. But like,
[01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:49.200]   what happens with sling, right? Like, so sling is an interesting one. I actually like them. I
[01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:54.800]   think they're a good company that makes them own sound dish, right? Yeah, I believe so. But like,
[01:18:55.760 --> 01:19:01.760]   who knows what I mean? I mean, ATT can come and buy that or Disney might buy them. And you
[01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:05.440]   know, it's like, you could totally see that happening in which case you start losing,
[01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:13.360]   you know, this competition and then, then, then upside for YouTube. Is it in the long run,
[01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:20.320]   YouTube in the cat's catbird seat here? Is it is it going to matter that we have
[01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:26.880]   Disney anymore in 20 years or is it? Yeah, I think there's always going to be a demand for quality
[01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:30.880]   scripted programming. I mean, well, you could have quality scripted programming on YouTube.
[01:19:30.880 --> 01:19:34.800]   Well, are you saying that? I have to disagree. Yeah, they tried that. YouTube is
[01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:41.360]   moving to the space. It's terrible stuff. It's it's a very young people, but it's not good stuff.
[01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:47.200]   Except for the fact that is Leo, are you saying that because they are almost crowdsourcing all
[01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:53.120]   of the talent that they can almost be their own eventually, all of the talent bubbles up from
[01:19:53.120 --> 01:19:57.360]   YouTube. And so then in theory, they could just I think they can own it all. And I think the
[01:19:57.360 --> 01:20:02.400]   spot it's the Spotify argument. Yeah, but it's more than that. It's about it's about really what
[01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:09.440]   it's about is the fracturing of the commons. And I worry in the long run that this may not be good
[01:20:09.440 --> 01:20:16.240]   for the world that everybody has their own little slice and niche. Right. Doesn't know anything
[01:20:16.240 --> 01:20:24.320]   about anybody else. Yeah. And so as long as YouTube gives me the whatever is the car content I want,
[01:20:24.320 --> 01:20:29.440]   or you want, or whatever it is, you're going to watch that. And you're going to be satisfied with
[01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:34.880]   that. And eventually because of the great expense of buying all these different channels and all
[01:20:34.880 --> 01:20:39.040]   this premium content, I think people are just going to turn their bag. I think there's a whole
[01:20:39.040 --> 01:20:42.880]   generation coming up that never spent money on premium content. They're just going to turn
[01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:46.800]   their back on it. They're going to say, look, I get everything I want right here for free.
[01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:53.200]   Yeah. Yeah. I think I don't know if you're a Neil Stevenson fan, but I'm at the age is one of my
[01:20:53.200 --> 01:20:58.720]   favorite novels. And I think about that line in every day where they're talking at the Victorians,
[01:20:58.720 --> 01:21:04.480]   and they came to the conclusion as a society. It's not good for everyone not to read the same
[01:21:04.480 --> 01:21:11.920]   newspaper. But that sounds so fashionable. It does. But there's, you know, you look at, I remember
[01:21:11.920 --> 01:21:16.960]   in the 90s thinking, oh, it's going to be great when we can segment it out. I can talk to people
[01:21:16.960 --> 01:21:21.600]   from my viewpoint. And today we're not able to have a conversation with each other.
[01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:25.040]   One of the best things, you know, I just came back from traveling in the Middle East. One of the
[01:21:25.040 --> 01:21:29.600]   best things about traveling is you meet people who you've been told things, especially in the
[01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:33.440]   Middle East about. But then you go there and you meet them and you realize everything you've
[01:21:33.440 --> 01:21:39.040]   been told is wrong and that they're humans and you get, it broadens your horizons. And the people
[01:21:39.040 --> 01:21:44.240]   who never travel don't, you know, they can have those illusions about the other. And I think we're
[01:21:44.240 --> 01:21:50.240]   getting in a world where it's so fragmented now, you read the news that agrees with what you think
[01:21:50.240 --> 01:21:55.200]   that we can have, we literally now in this country have different sets of facts.
[01:21:55.200 --> 01:22:01.280]   And my fact may not be the same as somebody else's fact. My day effect was a fact.
[01:22:01.280 --> 01:22:07.040]   But we don't agree anymore on what is a fact, what's true. And so I worry about what the world
[01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:11.520]   looks like with that kind of fragmentation in the long run. I just, I feel like that's a risky
[01:22:11.520 --> 01:22:19.040]   proposition. Yeah. Stephen talks about that. Yeah. Right. And in the fall, he talks about it
[01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:29.040]   very directly. Yeah. I mean, I'm just, I'm just wondering, I don't know what the answer is going
[01:22:29.040 --> 01:22:35.680]   to be. I'll be dead before that happens. So I don't care. Go ahead. You can say it. Okay, Boomer.
[01:22:36.640 --> 01:22:40.320]   No, I wasn't thinking. Sure. You were. Okay. I love that.
[01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:45.440]   I, I, I tell you one of the things that's changed is I've gotten older. I was watching
[01:22:45.440 --> 01:22:51.200]   Patriot games the other day. And it's a, you know, it's based on Tom Clancy novel from the 80s.
[01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:55.840]   And I'm watching it. It's a universe without cell phones or computers interrupting your
[01:22:55.840 --> 01:23:01.120]   concentration every few seconds. I'm looking at, I'm going, that's sanity. That's sanity.
[01:23:01.120 --> 01:23:05.760]   We're insane. I almost feel robbed as a generation that I didn't get much of that world.
[01:23:05.760 --> 01:23:10.640]   I remember the first time I noticed this, what was going on with cell phones, it was maybe 10
[01:23:10.640 --> 01:23:15.440]   years ago in Paris. And I was sitting outside and Notre Dame really enjoying the atmosphere. And,
[01:23:15.440 --> 01:23:19.040]   and I, and then I noticed there are a lot of Parisians walking around like this, looking at
[01:23:19.040 --> 01:23:24.320]   their phone, walking around like this. And I thought that's weird. Now that's all you see anywhere.
[01:23:24.320 --> 01:23:30.560]   People are live there. Our lives suddenly have become six and a half inch screens.
[01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:36.640]   That's weird. And these are, and I think some of this comes from that algorithmic addiction
[01:23:36.640 --> 01:23:42.320]   that these companies, that's worries me a lot more than privacy. These companies have figured out
[01:23:42.320 --> 01:23:48.240]   how to grab our attention and keep it completely keep it. We are Skinner boxes. We're in scare
[01:23:48.240 --> 01:23:52.960]   boxes. It was funny what the cell phone stuff was when they first, when smartphones, or now you
[01:23:52.960 --> 01:23:57.200]   in smartphones and cell phones first kind of came out, you know, it was only business people had
[01:23:57.200 --> 01:24:01.680]   them. And I remember I was one of the first of my like age group to get one and people are always
[01:24:01.680 --> 01:24:06.240]   like, you know, why do you have a cell phone? What do you, a drug dealer? Yeah, right. Yeah,
[01:24:06.240 --> 01:24:14.480]   even had a pager, but it was so cool. But I remember the big discussion in civil society at the time
[01:24:14.480 --> 01:24:19.120]   was how annoying it was and whether or not you should carry on public conversations on smart
[01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:23.920]   on cell phones. You'd have people on the trains and that's when they long on railroad, create quiet
[01:24:23.920 --> 01:24:31.760]   cars and things. I used to and this is confessing of a crime. I bought and imported a cell phone
[01:24:31.760 --> 01:24:36.720]   jammer and I would just sit along on the road and just jam people go to the quiet car and jam
[01:24:36.720 --> 01:24:43.360]   the phone. Oh, so good. It felt so awesome just to see someone on the phone just blab. Sorry. Hello.
[01:24:43.360 --> 01:24:49.840]   Oh my God. I love it. I want it. But that was highly illegal, obviously. Yeah. But that all went
[01:24:49.840 --> 01:24:54.800]   away now because no one talks on phones anymore. Right. Then it switched over to people just
[01:24:54.800 --> 01:24:59.120]   staring and it was a lot less annoying because they weren't bothering you. So we accepted it.
[01:24:59.120 --> 01:25:02.880]   But yeah, now we carry around these devices. We're all in our phone. We're all in our little
[01:25:02.880 --> 01:25:08.080]   six and a half inch glass screen world. Yeah. Yeah. And all the time. That's that's the world we
[01:25:08.080 --> 01:25:13.200]   live in. And smart watches now do the same thing that people look at their watches all time and
[01:25:13.200 --> 01:25:19.680]   we're a interesting world. Yeah, we're we're biological creatures. I tell you we're
[01:25:19.680 --> 01:25:25.280]   everything we create. So we're communicating. It's just where we're psychological where
[01:25:25.280 --> 01:25:32.160]   these social addicted animals. And so that's all these tools are. Yeah. Bleaks says cell phone
[01:25:32.160 --> 01:25:39.120]   jammers are highly illegal and very affordable. Yes. It looked like it looked like a cell phone.
[01:25:39.120 --> 01:25:44.160]   Really? So you didn't even know what you were doing? Yeah. It looked like a cell phone just had
[01:25:44.160 --> 01:25:48.720]   dual antennas on it. But you would hit this button. It was pretty rad. I'm very happy. I also have
[01:25:48.720 --> 01:25:54.560]   I also not to discourage or depress people. I also have hope for humans. And I think that
[01:25:54.560 --> 01:25:59.680]   as we we are walking down that path, but we will turn back humans don't want that and we will
[01:25:59.680 --> 01:26:05.520]   ultimately turn back. Yeah. And and I have faith that we will we will see the era of our ways and
[01:26:05.520 --> 01:26:11.840]   we'll start knowing one another. I think they're I think in the world. I'm I you know, I was really
[01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:15.760]   worried about social media about Facebook and Twitter. And then we started our own little forum.
[01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:21.440]   And it's such an antidote to the global forums. It's it's a Twit. Community. It's a
[01:26:21.440 --> 01:26:25.600]   WWW. Twit. Community. And it's a wonderful place. And it's been really great. And there's
[01:26:25.600 --> 01:26:31.360]   none of the awful stuff that you see in mainstream social media that I've started to realize that
[01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:39.440]   maybe maybe they'll come around. Yeah. It'll come around. Did you see that the Wikipedia
[01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:46.880]   founders on social media? Jimmy Wales. So he had a failed news initiative. Yep. And what was it?
[01:26:46.880 --> 01:26:52.160]   What was it called? Wiki. Wiki Tribune. Tribune. And this is Wiki Tribune social. Yeah.
[01:26:52.160 --> 01:26:57.520]   I went to it and it seems to be mostly I tried to sign up for it. It seems to be mostly about
[01:26:57.520 --> 01:27:00.160]   cryptocurrency. So I left.
[01:27:00.160 --> 01:27:06.400]   Well, I've got to pay my $10 to get in there so we can have some different comments.
[01:27:06.400 --> 01:27:10.480]   Yeah, we could we could start our own. But but when you first sign up for it, it says,
[01:27:10.480 --> 01:27:15.440]   okay, we'll pick some subjects that you'd like to know more about and 90% of what we're crypto.
[01:27:15.440 --> 01:27:20.960]   This is the problem with any social network. And this is why you I think that you can't have
[01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:26.000]   mass social networks. You have to have smaller, more community social networks because a mass
[01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:30.320]   social network, you're going to get the mass conversation. Yeah, which is exactly opposite
[01:27:30.320 --> 01:27:34.480]   about what I was saying about the fragmentation of facts and stuff. So I don't know what the answer is.
[01:27:34.480 --> 01:27:38.720]   Do you know where I'm at? Christina Warren, it was on app.net, which was this
[01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:44.960]   failed Twitter. Clones. I loved it. It was great. It was all developed. It was a it was a social
[01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:50.160]   network with nothing but developers. And I made some of the best friends of my life there. Yes.
[01:27:50.160 --> 01:27:57.520]   Yeah. And that that accord of in a sort of way became good news. Social became masted on.
[01:27:57.520 --> 01:28:01.440]   So there is a thread continuing app.net failure was you had to pay for it.
[01:28:02.080 --> 01:28:07.600]   Maybe that was the secret of its success. I don't know. Our show today brought to you by
[01:28:07.600 --> 01:28:16.080]   this is something that'll make you feel better. Calm. Calm calm calm calm. What a great app. The

[01:28:53.120 --> 01:28:58.320]   They have plenty of like the velveteen rabbit that your kids would love, but they also have
[01:28:58.320 --> 01:29:04.560]   fun stories that are kind of edgy like their best one is. Well, one of the best is certainly
[01:29:04.560 --> 01:29:09.280]   good for putting me to sleep is an ASMR by a guy who calls himself the French Whisperer.
[01:29:09.280 --> 01:29:14.640]   And the French and the French Whisperer explains the theory of relativity.

[01:30:39.840 --> 01:30:44.880]   Smokeweed, which I can't do anymore. It's an iPhone. What the hell, Apple? Wait a minute.
[01:30:44.880 --> 01:30:48.160]   Apple took all of the vaping apps. Are they what you're talking about?
[01:30:48.160 --> 01:30:55.760]   Do you vape? I do. Did you get crazy when you saw that what 76 people died from vaping?
[01:30:55.760 --> 01:30:59.840]   I know. My girlfriend gives me crap about that. I'm like, what? Sorry.
[01:30:59.840 --> 01:31:07.840]   It's better. Well, see, I have a mixed feelings about this because my daughter who smokes cigarettes,
[01:31:08.480 --> 01:31:13.840]   I said, get a jewel. I mean, it's better. It's going to be better than smoking cigarettes.
[01:31:13.840 --> 01:31:19.040]   I understand the problem jewel was advertising to people who never smoked, especially kids,
[01:31:19.040 --> 01:31:24.800]   with candy flavors and stuff. They got rid of those. But if you're a smoker, isn't it better
[01:31:24.800 --> 01:31:28.400]   to vape than the smoke? It's better for you. A new study just came out showing like,
[01:31:28.400 --> 01:31:33.840]   heart improvements for smokers who switched to vaping. Yeah. I mean, admittedly, you shouldn't do
[01:31:33.840 --> 01:31:39.760]   any of it. But good luck, not good luck stopping. It's not easy. Yeah, I look at like coffee. I mean,
[01:31:39.760 --> 01:31:44.160]   it's like, you know, caffeine is not really good for you. But it's as far as it's like,
[01:31:44.160 --> 01:31:50.160]   you put pot in your vape. Oh, yeah. Yeah. And the reason I got into it is because I go to see,
[01:31:50.160 --> 01:31:54.560]   yes. And we're going to get you arrested one way or the other on this show today.
[01:31:54.560 --> 01:31:59.040]   This is a Massachusetts. It's legal. Oh, you're in a hippie state.
[01:32:00.560 --> 01:32:06.960]   Cool. Now, you know, about our fine governor, like banning vaping here. And then it came out.
[01:32:06.960 --> 01:32:11.760]   It was all black market stuff, according to the CBC that was killing people.
[01:32:11.760 --> 01:32:18.240]   It's just vitamin E. Now they figured out they figured out they were putting an additive in some
[01:32:18.240 --> 01:32:25.200]   of the THC capsules that did something terrible to your lungs. It's a bigger argument to make this
[01:32:25.200 --> 01:32:29.440]   stuff legal because this is again, came back to regulation because you can then regulate the
[01:32:29.440 --> 01:32:33.440]   market. It's one of the best things to happen to the pot industry is regulation. You actually
[01:32:33.440 --> 01:32:38.720]   know what you're getting now. In fact, hacks. So I was bringing them up PAX. They're one of the most
[01:32:38.720 --> 01:32:42.000]   interesting companies in this area. They're a company. I was like, Oh, I should have been in
[01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:46.080]   on this like five years ago. They were in Vegas at CES. They were giving out their,
[01:32:46.080 --> 01:32:53.600]   their little vaping tool, which is like 30 bucks. And then you can go to a dispensary and get a free
[01:32:55.280 --> 01:33:00.080]   vape thing from them. They're giving away free weed, basically. It was crazy. And that's how I got
[01:33:00.080 --> 01:33:05.920]   into it. This was a fever dream I had when I was a teenager, you know, someday, man, someday
[01:33:05.920 --> 01:33:10.720]   they're going to you're going to be able to buy a joint in the grocery store, man. It'll be
[01:33:10.720 --> 01:33:17.040]   electric. If you told me someday they'll be giving a pot out for free, man. I would have said.
[01:33:17.040 --> 01:33:23.760]   So I feel like I have to say here, you know, I'm very pro marijuana. You know, I've been on
[01:33:23.760 --> 01:33:28.240]   record saying this after gamergate, I was so traumatized from the death threats and bricks
[01:33:28.240 --> 01:33:34.720]   through my window that my, my specialist in PTSD was like, look, marijuana is legal here. I'd never
[01:33:34.720 --> 01:33:41.200]   tried it before. You've never used it before. I'd used it like one or two times. I didn't like it.
[01:33:41.200 --> 01:33:47.200]   And she was like, this is a path for you to get better. It did help me. I do it often,
[01:33:47.200 --> 01:33:53.440]   but it was a miracle drug for me. That said, Daniel, I guys say this. I tried vaping twice.
[01:33:54.000 --> 01:34:00.160]   And it is it is hell on your lungs. And I say that as a runner. And it's I it's your choice.
[01:34:00.160 --> 01:34:06.720]   It's obviously better than smoking. But I think it's got to be said just to be responsible that this is
[01:34:06.720 --> 01:34:13.760]   you're introducing any contaminant that might be in there directly into your your bronchial system.
[01:34:13.760 --> 01:34:20.240]   And if something is smoking cigarettes is not good either. It's very bad. I would think vaping is
[01:34:20.240 --> 01:34:24.960]   preferable to smoking to burn. Especially if you're getting real stuff, you know, from a from a lab,
[01:34:24.960 --> 01:34:30.640]   like you can get in Massachusetts. Yeah. Hey, Daniel, can I ask a question that bringing it back to
[01:34:30.640 --> 01:34:36.320]   the Apple banning the apps thing as soon as I saw this? No, by the way, I'm by the way, you've
[01:34:36.320 --> 01:34:40.640]   got a picture over your right shoulder of a guy vaping. I just want to say Brian.
[01:34:40.640 --> 01:34:45.280]   Wait, where is that? Right. Over. No, you're right shoulder. The other one.
[01:34:46.160 --> 01:34:51.280]   Who's that guy below? Not the Time magazine right below it. Oh, there's a guy vaping right there.
[01:34:51.280 --> 01:34:58.320]   That's that's David Letterman. Okay. That's a picture from like 1982 or something. Is there smoke on it or is
[01:34:58.320 --> 01:35:03.360]   it just my imagination? It's some sort of reflection from me having a war. Oh, it's a reflection. Okay.
[01:35:03.360 --> 01:35:09.120]   Yeah. Yeah. And I just want to say, I just want to be the guy advocating for sobriety. I don't have
[01:35:09.120 --> 01:35:16.000]   enough brain cells to sacrifice to vaping or pot or to anything. So I mean, I'd smoked a lot
[01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:20.640]   of pot used a lot of drugs when I was a young man. And I don't know. I might have actually been a
[01:35:20.640 --> 01:35:27.600]   success had I not, but I'm not doing it now. I'll tell you that right now. Daniel, what would vape
[01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:37.520]   apps be good for? That's okay. So this is the story. Apple removed 100 on Friday, 181, 181 apps
[01:35:37.520 --> 01:35:44.720]   that allowed people to control the temperature settings on their vaping device, social networks,
[01:35:44.720 --> 01:35:50.880]   games. They never did allow the sale of cartridges through those apps. They were apps to control
[01:35:50.880 --> 01:35:56.960]   the vaping device. Do you use an app? Daniel? Yeah. Yeah. So this is why I found pack super
[01:35:56.960 --> 01:36:00.880]   interesting because I was the same way I was like, I was like, wait, it's Bluetooth and it connects
[01:36:00.880 --> 01:36:05.600]   to your phone. I'm like, come on. This is more like Internet of far my language. But like, you
[01:36:05.600 --> 01:36:10.560]   know, like we don't need this. But then the app. So this is why the app is good. One. Yeah,
[01:36:10.560 --> 01:36:17.200]   because that's a temperature which affects the intensity of it. You can also control the density
[01:36:17.200 --> 01:36:23.200]   of it. So the dosage, so you could choose micro small, medium or large. And so you could actually
[01:36:23.200 --> 01:36:29.040]   give this to someone with the packed cartridge and set it to micro. And then when you inhale it,
[01:36:29.040 --> 01:36:32.880]   there's a little meter that will go across your smartphone screen telling you how long
[01:36:32.880 --> 01:36:37.200]   you should take the hit for. So it's a way. Oh my God, you're kidding.
[01:36:37.760 --> 01:36:43.200]   No, no. Again, this is a teenage fever dream. Someday you'll have a computer in your pocket
[01:36:43.200 --> 01:36:47.680]   that'll tell you how long to take a hit for. Yeah. But you could like give this letter to your
[01:36:47.680 --> 01:36:52.720]   grandma and be like, just set it on my grandma. Yeah. Yeah. And and she went in. There's no,
[01:36:52.720 --> 01:36:58.640]   it lessens the risk of getting too high. Well, tell grandma to get an Android device because
[01:36:58.640 --> 01:37:05.920]   you're on there. But yes, you could do that. But also, packs introduced a thing where you put the
[01:37:05.920 --> 01:37:12.480]   the new pods in. It can ID match it. And I'll tell you exactly what's in there from the from the
[01:37:12.480 --> 01:37:18.800]   last. Look at this. And you can see if it's a Tiva, Indica, CBD, a hybrid, you can see whether
[01:37:18.800 --> 01:37:24.640]   the effect is chill, celebrate, create relief, hustle. Really, you can smoke pot for hustle.
[01:37:24.640 --> 01:37:30.560]   Yeah, apparently. This is like the benefit of like having a controlled marijuana industry.
[01:37:30.560 --> 01:37:35.760]   Like you do get to specific brands and you know what they're kind. Be cool. Stay in school.
[01:37:35.760 --> 01:37:44.960]   Cheese Louise. Super exciting. I was like, this is the way this industry should go forward and be
[01:37:44.960 --> 01:37:49.200]   more mature about it. And I agree with Brianna. I mean, we don't know a lot about vaping long-term
[01:37:49.200 --> 01:37:53.280]   health effects. And that's where like we need to have, again, an open discussion. There needs to
[01:37:53.280 --> 01:37:58.160]   be research on this stuff brought out there to health risks mentioned. I do believe, you know,
[01:37:58.160 --> 01:38:02.080]   if you're an adult 18, if we're going to have alcohol and cigarettes to legal, like,
[01:38:02.080 --> 01:38:05.840]   right, why not have pot? I don't have a problem. This seems to be, but we should get qualified.
[01:38:05.840 --> 01:38:14.080]   When I when I smoke, I smoke pineapple haze. It's an 86% point. Oh, two percent combination of
[01:38:14.080 --> 01:38:20.720]   set Tiva. It combines the tropical aroma of pineapple with the racing cerebral energy of haze.
[01:38:20.720 --> 01:38:27.840]   It's awesome. I'm not a pothead. I didn't start smoking till. I mean, I'm 42 now, but I think
[01:38:27.840 --> 01:38:32.960]   the first time I actually I spoke to like once in my early 30s, but it was only like, well, I was 40.
[01:38:32.960 --> 01:38:37.440]   I started getting. So is Apple doing this just because it's the, you know, it's hip. It's now,
[01:38:37.440 --> 01:38:42.560]   it's with it. Or is it doing it because there's genuinely a problem with these apps? I don't
[01:38:42.560 --> 01:38:48.400]   honestly see a problem. I'm frustrated because I see that for my packs, like Apple deleted the app
[01:38:48.400 --> 01:38:54.240]   from my phone altogether. So they didn't just they deleted it. Unless I deleted it. I don't
[01:38:54.240 --> 01:39:00.000]   remember it, but it's it's going to be. They said that you were still allowed to use it and still
[01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:05.280]   install it if you already took it out of the store. Yeah. Yeah. Are you probably high and deleted it?
[01:39:05.280 --> 01:39:13.520]   What's this? If you're using it for medical purposes, I think it just feels because that's
[01:39:13.520 --> 01:39:19.120]   the strongest argument for legal marijuana to me is, you know, there is a medical use for it. I
[01:39:19.120 --> 01:39:24.880]   talked to veterans all the time that they use it to treat PTSD. And I'm glad to see our fine,
[01:39:24.880 --> 01:39:30.160]   commonwealth of Massachusetts leading the way. But it just seems to me like Daniel said, you can
[01:39:30.160 --> 01:39:36.400]   dose it out very specifically for what you want. I've never smoked it before. I had no idea what
[01:39:36.400 --> 01:39:42.880]   it would do. And it was good to be able to take just a very little amount. If I were packs labs,
[01:39:42.880 --> 01:39:49.520]   I would make a PWA, a progressive web app. You could do that. Right. Apple can't stop you from
[01:39:49.520 --> 01:39:53.840]   doing that. And then you could put it on your home screen. Yeah. I wonder if they can do that
[01:39:53.840 --> 01:40:00.560]   with a Bluetooth connection and PWA. Oh, it's so that's what it needs. It needs to connect to the pen.
[01:40:00.560 --> 01:40:09.840]   Okay. I never thought we'd be talking about this. And we've refused for years. We've refused ads
[01:40:09.840 --> 01:40:16.720]   from for CBD products for vaping products of all kinds. I just, I was at that, I was at that
[01:40:16.720 --> 01:40:22.880]   fireside conference that that conference up in Canada this year. Yeah. It was all. It was because
[01:40:22.880 --> 01:40:30.240]   pot is legal in Canada. It was all CBD and cannabis startups, everything. Yeah. Like half of the
[01:40:30.240 --> 01:40:36.960]   people there. Yeah. We, I think they thought in this, this is, you know, we're near Mendocino, which is
[01:40:37.440 --> 01:40:45.680]   like the headquarters of pot growing in California and Mendocino County. And I think everybody thought
[01:40:45.680 --> 01:40:49.520]   this would be the pedaloom of this little town where it would be the gateway to Mendocino. There
[01:40:49.520 --> 01:40:57.440]   was actually an Amish seed store that bought a giant, a giant. It was the old pedaloom of bank,
[01:40:57.440 --> 01:41:03.600]   10,000 square foot store where they were selling seeds, like tomato seeds. And I thought, well,
[01:41:03.600 --> 01:41:07.120]   you, I know what the rent is on that place. You couldn't possibly. And it found out,
[01:41:07.120 --> 01:41:11.280]   turned out their whole plan was, well, once pot's legal in California, which it is now,
[01:41:11.280 --> 01:41:19.040]   we are going to become the number one source of seeds. But it hasn't, it hasn't materialized.
[01:41:19.040 --> 01:41:23.760]   In fact, I think there's still more illegal growers than there are legal growers in this area.
[01:41:23.760 --> 01:41:29.360]   Yeah, California is obviously, you guys are a big state, but your history there is a lot more steep
[01:41:29.360 --> 01:41:35.040]   than this stuff. Oh, it's because we have a legacy. We have incumbents. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that makes
[01:41:35.040 --> 01:41:43.120]   sense. So the Canadian industry has kind of crashed in the past few, few. Has it? Yeah. Yeah. So
[01:41:43.120 --> 01:41:50.240]   legalizing isn't really necessarily the boom. It's mostly because there was a, there was a huge
[01:41:50.240 --> 01:41:57.200]   bubble to all those, all those people. So I said, like, yeah, it's a person or he's saying it's
[01:41:57.200 --> 01:42:01.440]   happened in the last couple of weeks, because this, I was at that coverage like three months ago.
[01:42:01.440 --> 01:42:05.120]   And it was, it happened. Yeah. It happened. And basically this week, it happened.
[01:42:05.120 --> 01:42:09.040]   Just now. The Canadian pot, pot stock bubble broke, bust.
[01:42:09.040 --> 01:42:15.200]   Okay. Had an all those startup pitches I saw. Yeah. Yeah. Half of those companies are, are,
[01:42:15.200 --> 01:42:19.520]   like, the lot of trouble this week. People are too stoned really to
[01:42:19.520 --> 01:42:26.400]   make a good market out of it. They're not people who smoke pot are not what I would call industrious.
[01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:33.280]   I got to tell you, Leo, there here in Massachusetts, when you to get for you to get on the ballot,
[01:42:33.280 --> 01:42:39.280]   you have to get, I believe, is 2,500 signatures and the people that worked hardest for me with
[01:42:39.280 --> 01:42:45.920]   the pot heads, legalization people that would sit outside of supermarkets in 20 degree weather
[01:42:45.920 --> 01:42:50.800]   and get signatures because they weren't feeling anything. Yeah. It's not that hard to be high
[01:42:50.800 --> 01:42:56.320]   and sit outside. Supermarket working very hard. So Brianna, by the way,
[01:42:56.320 --> 01:43:02.240]   I saw articles this week about how if, because the Trump administration is, is theoretically
[01:43:02.240 --> 01:43:07.520]   moving to do more regulation of vaping and things like that. And there were the articles
[01:43:07.520 --> 01:43:13.280]   about that about how vapors could be a single issue voting block. Whoa. Oh, I'm not surprised.
[01:43:13.280 --> 01:43:18.800]   Absolutely true. I'm not surprised. Yeah. Try banning coffee. You can make coffee drinkers of
[01:43:18.800 --> 01:43:24.000]   voting block too, right? Yeah. All right. I'll take a little break.
[01:43:25.120 --> 01:43:28.000]   And again, just a little disclaimer, kids don't smoke.
[01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:32.960]   It saps you of all ambition.
[01:43:32.960 --> 01:43:38.800]   I mean, that's a good thing. I don't know. If you're too ambitious, if you've got too much energy,
[01:43:38.800 --> 01:43:45.440]   you just, you really don't want to do anything. Go ahead. Be my guest. Our show today brought to
[01:43:45.440 --> 01:43:50.960]   you by worldwide technology, WWT. They've created this amazing advanced technology center. In fact,
[01:43:50.960 --> 01:43:55.040]   I think we're going to, I want to do an event out at this in St. Louis, because this is amazing.
[01:43:55.040 --> 01:44:02.240]   Half a billion dollars of enterprise gear in this ATC from hundreds of OEMs,
[01:44:02.240 --> 01:44:09.440]   key partners ranging from the big guys like Dell EMC to VMware Intel. They've also got the
[01:44:09.440 --> 01:44:14.720]   little guys, the disruptors like titanium and equinics and expanse. It's all in there because
[01:44:14.720 --> 01:44:19.360]   if you are in business and you are buying business technology, you got to know that everything's
[01:44:19.360 --> 01:44:23.600]   going to work the way you expect it to. You've got to be able to get everything working together.
[01:44:23.600 --> 01:44:29.120]   And that's where you do it at the ATC. Now, the engineers at Worldwide Tech have been using the ATC
[01:44:29.120 --> 01:44:36.480]   to create proofs of concept to spin up pilots, to let customers select the best solutions.
[01:44:36.480 --> 01:44:39.600]   But now you can do it too. And that's what's totally amazing.
[01:44:39.600 --> 01:44:46.000]   That's right. WWT has opened their advanced technology center to everybody with on-demand
[01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:52.640]   and schedulable labs like Dell EMC VxRail or Xtreme IO or X2 or Isilon.
[01:44:52.640 --> 01:44:58.560]   These labs represent the newest advances in primary storage. There are hundreds of labs that
[01:44:58.560 --> 01:45:04.960]   you can use to explore things like multi-cloud, hyper-converged infrastructure, networking,
[01:45:04.960 --> 01:45:11.040]   secondary storage, data analytics, AI. You don't have to operate in mystery. You can use the lab to
[01:45:11.040 --> 01:45:16.640]   find out exactly what it will do for you. They offer lab as a service that's a dedicated lab space
[01:45:16.640 --> 01:45:21.600]   within the Advanced Technology Center where you can perform your own programmatic testing using that
[01:45:21.600 --> 01:45:28.240]   vast and beautiful ecosystem of enterprise tech that WWT has built. And because it's virtual,
[01:45:28.240 --> 01:45:33.360]   you don't have to go to St. Louis. You can use the lab anywhere in the world 24/7.
[01:45:33.360 --> 01:45:38.400]   And I have to tell you, this ecosystem creates a multiplier effective knowledge of speed,
[01:45:38.400 --> 01:45:44.000]   of agility, anytime, anywhere around the world for all WWT customers. That should be you.
[01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:47.280]   You'll get access, not just to the labs, but articles, case studies, hands-on,
[01:45:47.280 --> 01:45:53.680]   use of these products, other tools that make a difference in today's fast-paced world. This is
[01:45:53.680 --> 01:45:59.680]   really a revolution in buying and using an understanding enterprise tech.

[01:46:24.880 --> 01:46:32.160]   I'm just curious what happened while I was gone. Fortunately, we have spicams everywhere. Watch.
[01:46:33.680 --> 01:46:35.680]   Previously on-twit.
[01:46:35.680 --> 01:46:41.360]   HoloLens 2. It's here and you both got to try it. I'm so jealous. I haven't even seen the first one.
[01:46:41.360 --> 01:46:42.320]   What did you do in it?
[01:46:42.320 --> 01:46:47.840]   How was my checkbook? I wrote a couple notes in no-pad.
[01:46:47.840 --> 01:46:49.520]   Oh my goodness.
[01:46:49.520 --> 01:46:52.160]   All about Android.
[01:46:52.160 --> 01:46:58.800]   Flow, you wrote something and your headline says it all. There just aren't enough good reasons
[01:46:58.800 --> 01:47:03.040]   to upgrade to the Pixel 4. Boom! That's old. That's old.
[01:47:03.040 --> 01:47:06.000]   Yeah, in the battery life, guys. There's-
[01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.080]   Yeah. What? Yeah. What? Yeah.
[01:47:08.080 --> 01:47:14.640]   Tech News Weekly. The MotoRaser was unveiled last night at an event.
[01:47:14.640 --> 01:47:17.440]   It has a clamshell design similar to the original
[01:47:17.440 --> 01:47:22.000]   Motorola Raser from 2014 in some ways.
[01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:26.480]   Mm-hmm. Twit. All your favorite podcasts from the 80s and 90s planned today.
[01:47:27.760 --> 01:47:29.440]   Have you played Minecraft Earth yet?
[01:47:29.440 --> 01:47:34.960]   Brianna, are you- No, no, I've even heard of this. Is it good?
[01:47:34.960 --> 01:47:38.240]   Yeah. So it's- Pokemon Go means Minecraft.
[01:47:38.240 --> 01:47:44.080]   Wow. Yeah. So you can build- I could build right there. I could build a thing and it persists in the
[01:47:44.080 --> 01:47:49.920]   world. I could come back to it. I could do more. You collect stuff. I'm- it just launched
[01:47:49.920 --> 01:47:54.800]   in the US only. I wasn't able to use it until I got home.
[01:47:55.600 --> 01:47:58.640]   Oh. It's really- But to other countries actually now. But it's-
[01:47:58.640 --> 01:48:02.960]   Yeah, it started actually often in some European countries first.
[01:48:02.960 --> 01:48:04.960]   Oh, okay. Now it's in the US as open.
[01:48:04.960 --> 01:48:07.520]   I couldn't use it in Dubai. I was very disappointed.
[01:48:07.520 --> 01:48:14.800]   Yeah. Dubai was not in Dubai, but it is here. And so- so I'm collecting Minecraft stuff.
[01:48:14.800 --> 01:48:16.720]   If you played Minecraft, you'll recognize it. Yeah.
[01:48:16.720 --> 01:48:21.920]   Dirt, cobblestones. But watch. So I can now build- let me build something here.
[01:48:22.800 --> 01:48:26.720]   So this takes a little- why? It's early days. I think it's kind of a beta. But it's going to give
[01:48:26.720 --> 01:48:32.480]   me an augmented reality view of this table. And I can build a little Minecraft castle right on
[01:48:32.480 --> 01:48:36.800]   this table. And it'll persist when I come back. It'll be there. Any changes I make will be there as
[01:48:36.800 --> 01:48:41.920]   well. I think it's a really- and this is- this is my- I think this is another Microsoft Azure
[01:48:41.920 --> 01:48:47.520]   show-off thing, Daniel. I feel like- Sure. It started off with HoloLens. If you remember when
[01:48:47.520 --> 01:48:50.400]   HoloLens first was announced- What do they call it?
[01:48:50.400 --> 01:48:55.040]   They- but there's a name for this. It's like Azure Places or something, right?
[01:48:55.040 --> 01:49:02.560]   Anchors. Anchors. That's it. Anchors is what- it's an open API that allows anyone creating a
[01:49:02.560 --> 01:49:07.920]   virtual or augmented reality to create real- real-world static points where you can create
[01:49:07.920 --> 01:49:13.520]   these holograms basically. And they persist. So let me do that right now. So you can see-
[01:49:13.520 --> 01:49:18.880]   I can see my table. There's the studio. I know you could kind of sort of see it. And I could place
[01:49:18.880 --> 01:49:24.400]   this little world there. Now that's going to stay there. And there's a little duck and I can dig in it.
[01:49:24.400 --> 01:49:30.960]   And I can build in it with the stuff that I've gathered. I could put it- let me just put a pig on
[01:49:30.960 --> 01:49:36.640]   there. Look at that. There's a little- That pig will never move. I put him on a top-
[01:49:36.640 --> 01:49:42.720]   pillar. So this is Azure Places- Anchors, rather.
[01:49:42.720 --> 01:49:45.040]   Yeah. Yeah. I think that's cool.
[01:49:45.040 --> 01:49:49.120]   So it started off originally as HoloLens as one of the experiences where they could show off the
[01:49:49.120 --> 01:49:53.040]   technology of what HoloLens could do. And that was back when they didn't- when they first
[01:49:53.040 --> 01:49:57.280]   announced HoloLens, they didn't know how to market it. Because originally, they were out of an
[01:49:57.280 --> 01:50:02.400]   Xbox concept. It was going to be like this sort of gaming thing. But then Nadella kind of came in
[01:50:02.400 --> 01:50:07.120]   and they seemed like they got more just pushing towards enterprise and real-world things. So
[01:50:07.120 --> 01:50:11.280]   they never created the full Minecraft experience, but the technology used there
[01:50:11.280 --> 01:50:15.680]   did turn into this, which is probably much smarter use of it. I just tried it for the first time
[01:50:15.680 --> 01:50:19.040]   last night. I was kind of impressed, but also bewildered.
[01:50:19.040 --> 01:50:22.320]   It's a little bit will-dering because it's not clear what the point of anything is.
[01:50:22.320 --> 01:50:25.040]   Right. There's no directions. It's just like-
[01:50:25.040 --> 01:50:27.120]   Just doing stuff. But yeah.
[01:50:27.120 --> 01:50:30.400]   So now it's in the US, UK, Canada, South Korea,
[01:50:30.400 --> 01:50:35.840]   Philippines, Sweden, Mexico, Australia, New Zealand, and Iceland. It's on iOS and Android.
[01:50:35.840 --> 01:50:41.120]   Minecraft is huge. Microsoft has turned out to be quite a good steward. I thought they-
[01:50:41.120 --> 01:50:44.480]   they would ruin Minecraft. In fact, they've done much better than Mojang ever did.
[01:50:44.480 --> 01:50:51.040]   Yeah. I often think about how for our generation, my generation, at least I'm Gen X, Super Mario
[01:50:51.040 --> 01:50:56.080]   for 1985 is such a huge game. And the number of people kids that have played Minecraft is like
[01:50:56.080 --> 01:51:02.800]   10 times bigger than that. I try to process that and I just can't. Yeah, Dina, I do have to say,
[01:51:02.800 --> 01:51:09.200]   I feel like HoloLens is- I can think of no Microsoft technology that deserved more
[01:51:09.920 --> 01:51:16.480]   success that did not get it. And I think it's just the moment it came out, VR just got so much more
[01:51:16.480 --> 01:51:21.280]   of the attention and specifically the dev focus and the fact that you could only code in it with
[01:51:21.280 --> 01:51:30.160]   C# and not languages like C++, I feel like it has so much potential still and it just- it needs-
[01:51:30.160 --> 01:51:34.160]   I want to see Microsoft come back and push it again because it is truly amazing.
[01:51:34.160 --> 01:51:39.520]   Well, they just shipped HoloLens 2 on the last week. So that was a big milestone for them.
[01:51:39.760 --> 01:51:45.680]   But yeah, they're taking a, I think, a safe and realistic approach right now to it, which is
[01:51:45.680 --> 01:51:52.000]   it's geared towards enterprise professionals, line workers, engineering architects,
[01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:58.640]   and it's- and even the military, right, which is a little bit controversial. But that's probably
[01:51:58.640 --> 01:52:05.280]   a safe spot for it because there's no external pressure to report numbers in the sense like if
[01:52:05.280 --> 01:52:09.600]   they ship these to consumers and you just go down to Best Buy and get them where they probably
[01:52:09.600 --> 01:52:14.080]   wouldn't sell, you would physically see them not selling and we'd have a lot more data and
[01:52:14.080 --> 01:52:19.680]   I think it's too risky right now for us to consumer play. But I think we all see the potential for
[01:52:19.680 --> 01:52:24.480]   augmented reality in the consumer space, but the technology's got to shrink down in size,
[01:52:24.480 --> 01:52:27.840]   it's got to come down in price, and a developer's story's got to build out.
[01:52:27.840 --> 01:52:34.480]   Microsoft is cooperating with iOS and Android in terms of making this Azure technology open source
[01:52:34.480 --> 01:52:38.560]   to them. So whatever platform you're building on, you can use Microsoft's own technology
[01:52:38.560 --> 01:52:43.600]   there, which I thought was also smart versus a walled garden proprietary approach. But yeah,
[01:52:43.600 --> 01:52:48.080]   still early days, but who knows, five years from now, maybe we'll actually have these simple
[01:52:48.080 --> 01:52:54.560]   glasses, like the company North makes them now where we have overlays of the real world.
[01:52:54.560 --> 01:53:00.080]   I was bringing this up at Ignite, where I was talking about how Microsoft obviously owns LinkedIn.
[01:53:00.080 --> 01:53:04.400]   LinkedIn is a social network built for professionals. It's like Facebook, but serious.
[01:53:04.400 --> 01:53:10.560]   But how cool would it be to be at a conference where you have your classes on and where you're
[01:53:10.560 --> 01:53:14.480]   walking up to people and you're getting their bio information, just like a video game would
[01:53:14.480 --> 01:53:18.880]   overlaying people so that you know who you're talking to. This is part of visual.
[01:53:18.880 --> 01:53:24.080]   Microsoft sees as the power of LinkedIn is it's a directory that introduces you to professional
[01:53:24.080 --> 01:53:30.080]   people. And with AI can bring up information based on what that person has interest in,
[01:53:30.080 --> 01:53:32.240]   where it overlaps with you and all this kind of stuff.
[01:53:32.240 --> 01:53:38.960]   So with with I bought Oculus Quest with pistol whip coming out. I don't know if you've seen this
[01:53:38.960 --> 01:53:43.760]   Leo. It's basically a John Wick simulator. I was I was aptly named. I might have.
[01:53:43.760 --> 01:53:47.840]   It's amazing. It's amazing. They should have called it pencil whipped, but okay.
[01:53:47.840 --> 01:53:55.520]   Yeah, but I've really been surprised with how much more I use my Oculus Quest just because
[01:53:55.520 --> 01:54:00.800]   it's not tethered to a computer. It's all it's a million times even though the quality is lower.
[01:54:00.800 --> 01:54:06.400]   It actually is better. It's a fair trade off because you're not tethered to a single room.
[01:54:06.400 --> 01:54:14.880]   You can bring it with you. I grant the value of virtual reality even more so of augmented reality,
[01:54:14.880 --> 01:54:18.800]   but I think we're so far off from the hardware living up to its promise.
[01:54:18.800 --> 01:54:27.440]   I mean, honestly, Snapchat spectacles are about that's the only real mass market product out there.
[01:54:27.440 --> 01:54:31.760]   They do you like the new spectacles? Anybody have them? I bought the original ones. Believe it or not.
[01:54:31.760 --> 01:54:35.600]   No, even Christina will buy these. Not even Christina.
[01:54:35.600 --> 01:54:40.960]   I remember waiting a line for them. Yeah, remember that? They had pop-up shops and I went on the
[01:54:40.960 --> 01:54:46.400]   eBay because I couldn't get to the pop-up shop and I found somebody was selling the
[01:54:46.400 --> 01:54:57.280]   spectacles they got. They make quite a statement. They were smart. They made a more steampunk this
[01:54:57.280 --> 01:55:03.760]   time. Yeah, you look like you're the the Sargent character from Ghost in the Shell.
[01:55:03.760 --> 01:55:08.560]   Yeah, you want to look a little modern if you're going to wear these. I think someday we'll get
[01:55:08.560 --> 01:55:12.960]   augmented reality, but it's going to have to be in something that is not much different than regular
[01:55:12.960 --> 01:55:18.960]   glasses. I agree. Apple's working on that. Was it Bloomberg's story? No, you don't buy that.
[01:55:18.960 --> 01:55:24.800]   Mark Gurman really knows his stuff. He says, "Apple's spectacles are coming out." What did he say? 2021?
[01:55:24.800 --> 01:55:31.440]   2022. Yes. I don't think we're going to do a headset first and then they would get the actual
[01:55:31.440 --> 01:55:37.280]   glasses by 2022. You know what? The phone makes a perfectly good. Look how I'm using the Minecraft.
[01:55:37.280 --> 01:55:43.200]   It's a perfectly good augmented reality thing. Who wants to wear that? Leo, that's the
[01:55:43.200 --> 01:55:50.960]   if you read the article. If you read the article, that's the point that they had this all hands
[01:55:50.960 --> 01:55:56.720]   meeting where it's like they want to get them on board with the next decade will be by 2030.
[01:55:56.720 --> 01:56:01.280]   We're going to be replacing smartphones with these sort of glasses. And they're smart to be
[01:56:01.280 --> 01:56:07.440]   planning for the demise of the iPhone. You've got to know what's next. It ain't this. I don't
[01:56:07.440 --> 01:56:12.880]   think so. I think it's too early. I can't wait. What I found not believable about the information
[01:56:12.880 --> 01:56:18.000]   article was Apple having an all hands on meeting at Steve Jobs Theatre. It just
[01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:23.280]   a one that knows it. Because it would leak. It looks at Apple. Yeah, it's just it's not it just sets
[01:56:23.280 --> 01:56:30.560]   my spider sense. Well, you couldn't fit a tense of the Apple team into the Steve Jobs Theatre. I don't
[01:56:30.560 --> 01:56:38.800]   know. One of the things that I like though in theory as a feature was that if you were using it
[01:56:38.800 --> 01:56:44.000]   theoretically with the glasses, I can't remember who said this, but if you were using it, your
[01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:49.840]   glass part would go dark. So you could alert other people that you were using the augmented stuff.
[01:56:49.840 --> 01:56:57.440]   Yeah. And this is in response to the splashback on Google Glass and the people who got beat up
[01:56:57.440 --> 01:57:03.200]   in bars. Yeah, there's also the people don't like the idea of a camera recording, which I think
[01:57:03.200 --> 01:57:09.280]   it still needs to be addressed. But yeah, I mean, even Alex Kippman, who does Microsoft's HoloLens,
[01:57:09.280 --> 01:57:14.800]   has talked about this tension between augmented reality and virtual reality and how you solve it.
[01:57:14.800 --> 01:57:19.280]   Because one of them is very good for gaming virtual reality, but one of them is good for the
[01:57:19.280 --> 01:57:25.040]   rest of the world, which is augmented. And one way you do that is you do have this glass that shifts
[01:57:25.760 --> 01:57:30.320]   from light to dark. Microsoft's work in this technology, other companies are working on this.
[01:57:30.320 --> 01:57:36.160]   We've seen that there's a electrostatic windows on airplanes. I can do this. So that technology is
[01:57:36.160 --> 01:57:41.360]   the next evolution. So everybody's kind of planning this stuff out, but we are years from it before
[01:57:41.360 --> 01:57:46.320]   it's a, you know, we are just wearing glasses. But I point to that company in North, the Canadian
[01:57:46.320 --> 01:57:51.120]   startup have glasses with a little pop up projector on the inside. It doesn't have cameras on the
[01:57:51.120 --> 01:57:55.760]   outside. So it's not recording anything. You wear a little ring that allows you to control it in
[01:57:55.760 --> 01:58:00.240]   a notification, connect it to your phone. But it's literally a little heads up display as you're
[01:58:00.240 --> 01:58:06.080]   walking around, you can see notifications, weather information. And it's this nice sort of hybrid
[01:58:06.080 --> 01:58:11.200]   between what Google Glass was trying to be and what we can actually do today. But I think this
[01:58:11.200 --> 01:58:15.280]   stuff is definitely, you know, people need to talk about it planet. What Microsoft is doing is
[01:58:15.280 --> 01:58:20.400]   basically building a foundation out for it. So that when it arrives, they're not caught flat-footed.
[01:58:21.040 --> 01:58:25.120]   Because you got to build up the ecosystem around it. And that's where they're doing right now. So
[01:58:25.120 --> 01:58:30.640]   I don't know. I do think this future is going to eventually happen. Or we're definitely years from
[01:58:30.640 --> 01:58:35.600]   from reality. I just love the idea of being in a boring conversation and your glasses just get
[01:58:35.600 --> 01:58:42.880]   darker. Oh, you're not paying attention, are you? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think there'll be a market
[01:58:42.880 --> 01:58:48.800]   for it. I don't know. I don't know. Here's a little campaign tip for you, Brianna, for your Congress
[01:58:49.440 --> 01:58:57.600]   run in Great Britain, the Labor Party, which has been struggling for, I don't know, decades, I think,
[01:58:57.600 --> 01:59:04.240]   is saying if you elect us, we'll give every home and business in the UK free full fiber broadband
[01:59:04.240 --> 01:59:14.240]   by 2030. I'm thinking through that problem. There's a big movement in Cambridge to have
[01:59:14.240 --> 01:59:21.040]   municipal broadband. But like for a nationwide thing, I don't know. This would require, I believe
[01:59:21.040 --> 01:59:28.080]   this would require nationalizing BT, is part of the deal here. So I think it's one of those empty
[01:59:28.080 --> 01:59:33.920]   campaign promises. Although I have to say, I would vote for any candidate who said, "Broadband
[01:59:33.920 --> 01:59:39.440]   for all, you'd have my vote." I mean, you're a graph party. It's a leisure in the UK. You can't do it
[01:59:39.440 --> 01:59:44.080]   in the US. The Labor Party has a long history of nationalizing industries.
[01:59:44.080 --> 01:59:51.520]   We definitely need, I mean, even where I am in Worcester, we don't have fiber optic.
[01:59:51.520 --> 01:59:58.720]   But I think it's going to take, certainly in the US, and I would bet in many countries, it needs
[01:59:58.720 --> 02:00:03.520]   government subsidy because there's so many areas. It's not economically viable.
[02:00:04.480 --> 02:00:09.600]   Because I know when I was in Long Islands for a long time, and I can't believe I was taking a
[02:00:09.600 --> 02:00:17.360]   side of Verizon here, but Verizon was going town to town trying to get Fios, but they would have to go
[02:00:17.360 --> 02:00:22.800]   and get approval for each town and who was there fighting them in each town, cable vision.
[02:00:22.800 --> 02:00:28.880]   What ended up happening was Verizon would start building out the infrastructure. They could start
[02:00:28.880 --> 02:00:32.560]   to do that, lay the fiber, and then they were trying to get approval. Then what happened when
[02:00:32.560 --> 02:00:38.240]   the towns were becoming cognizant of this? Like, "Oh, wait, you rebuilt everything, so now we can
[02:00:38.240 --> 02:00:42.560]   charge you a little bit more for it." This is one reason, and I don't know if Brianna knows more
[02:00:42.560 --> 02:00:47.120]   about this too, Massachusetts. I know Verizon's pulled back its Fios plans here, Massachusetts
[02:00:47.120 --> 02:00:50.880]   pretty significantly. As far as I know, there's no plans to build Fios anymore,
[02:00:50.880 --> 02:00:58.320]   especially out here in central Mass. That's the problem. It's not like Fios is about to be
[02:00:58.320 --> 02:01:04.720]   installed. No one's doing fiber optic, period, installation. Now, cable has gotten better.
[02:01:04.720 --> 02:01:10.000]   I use Spectrum here, and they've actually been pretty solid, but I would like to at least have
[02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:15.520]   the choice, or knowing that someday I'll have fiber optic routed to my house, and there's just
[02:01:15.520 --> 02:01:20.800]   no inclination that's ever going to happen. I find that disturbing.
[02:01:20.800 --> 02:01:25.920]   Yeah, I think if you look at rural electrification, I think we would all agree that's one of the most
[02:01:25.920 --> 02:01:32.160]   successful American initiatives in our history. I think broadband and access to it, that is a
[02:01:32.160 --> 02:01:39.760]   you need it for your job, you need it for your work. It's not an optional thing in 2019.
[02:01:39.760 --> 02:01:49.040]   I would say I would be very hesitant about giving government the power to do that in the way I would
[02:01:49.040 --> 02:01:54.320]   like to see it as encouraging more competition, because we essentially have a duopoly with internet
[02:01:54.320 --> 02:01:58.080]   service providers in the country. John is so excited. John Nars,
[02:01:58.080 --> 02:02:02.480]   studio manager, Jammerby, because he got this door hanger on his house that said
[02:02:02.480 --> 02:02:08.000]   Sonic is about to put fiber, gigabit fiber internet, to his house in his neighborhood.
[02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:12.880]   Why can't you get it yet? No, but they have to trench and they have to get up.
[02:02:12.880 --> 02:02:16.640]   Yeah. Oh, they're going to put it on the polls. So that's the other thing that people are talking
[02:02:16.640 --> 02:02:23.200]   about is access to existing polls, Brianna. And some people, you know, telecos don't like this
[02:02:23.200 --> 02:02:27.520]   too much because that's competition. But in some jurisdictions, that's what they're doing, right?
[02:02:27.520 --> 02:02:30.720]   Yeah, that makes a lot of sense to me. I think that's brilliant.
[02:02:30.720 --> 02:02:39.520]   Last story. This kind of goes back to our data collection. A health care provider in Pennsylvania
[02:02:39.520 --> 02:02:50.080]   took 1.77 million EKG results from nearly 400,000 people, ran it through an artificial intelligence
[02:02:50.080 --> 02:02:55.440]   and came up with an AI that could accurately predict your chances of dying within a year,
[02:02:55.440 --> 02:03:02.000]   even if you have a completely normal EKG according to your physician.
[02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:09.040]   The physicians have no idea why it works. One little problem with that story, isn't it?
[02:03:09.040 --> 02:03:17.760]   Well, actually, if a little problem is you had to have your EKG, but a 0.85% score,
[02:03:17.760 --> 02:03:21.440]   which is a perfect score, getting 100% correlation would be one.
[02:03:21.440 --> 02:03:27.600]   If you just guessed, you'd have a 0.5. So 0.85 is actually better than any model physicians are
[02:03:27.600 --> 02:03:33.600]   currently using. We were talking about this earlier on something or else about Black,
[02:03:33.600 --> 02:03:38.240]   oh, the algorithms. The whole Black Box thing with AI is the problem.
[02:03:38.240 --> 02:03:45.040]   It's like a glass is half empty, glasses have full situation. So AI is better at telling us,
[02:03:45.040 --> 02:03:50.880]   if you're a healthy person, you could die within a year of heart trouble or whatever.
[02:03:50.880 --> 02:03:56.480]   However, the machines are not able to tell us how they're better than we are.
[02:03:56.480 --> 02:04:01.200]   Right. Because machine learning doesn't make rules in the way we understand it,
[02:04:01.200 --> 02:04:08.400]   it makes a model. You're right that the problem with this is a doctor can't figure out from what
[02:04:08.400 --> 02:04:16.080]   the AI is doing, how to better diagnose heart problems. They said the AI accurately predicted
[02:04:16.080 --> 02:04:22.080]   risk of death, even in people deemed to have a normal ECG. The findings suggest that the model
[02:04:22.080 --> 02:04:27.360]   is seeing things humans probably can't see, or at least we just ignore and think are normal,
[02:04:27.360 --> 02:04:33.920]   but it can't tell us. The quote from the doctor is that finding suggests that the model is seeing
[02:04:33.920 --> 02:04:37.440]   things that humans probably can't see or that we just ignore and think are normal.
[02:04:38.160 --> 02:04:42.160]   It's still unclear what the pattern the AI is picking up, which makes some physicians reluctant
[02:04:42.160 --> 02:04:47.360]   to use such algorithms. AI can potentially teach us things that we've maybe been misinterpreting
[02:04:47.360 --> 02:04:52.160]   for decades, if they could tell us. That's a flaw in humans, because we say, "Oh, we don't
[02:04:52.160 --> 02:04:56.960]   want to use it if we don't know how it works." But that's just the nature of AI, and particularly
[02:04:56.960 --> 02:05:03.120]   of these giant machine learning models, it doesn't generate a human readable rule set.
[02:05:04.880 --> 02:05:07.920]   Do you say don't use it because we can't determine what the rules are?
[02:05:07.920 --> 02:05:14.560]   This is a foundational, problem in cognitive science, too, when we try to understand the mind.
[02:05:14.560 --> 02:05:19.680]   There's this assumption that humans have, which is, well, we cannot understand the universe,
[02:05:19.680 --> 02:05:26.880]   but there seems to be this other issue of, "We don't know what we can't know." We think we
[02:05:26.880 --> 02:05:31.840]   were smart enough to know everything, but it's sort of like how dogs can't talk, but they don't
[02:05:31.840 --> 02:05:38.240]   know they can't talk. There's this foundational issue with what the brain can do,
[02:05:38.240 --> 02:05:43.600]   and related to that, getting to this AI stuff, in theory, we could create machines and AI that
[02:05:43.600 --> 02:05:47.920]   someday could surpass us and know things that we can't possibly understand what they know.
[02:05:47.920 --> 02:05:51.920]   This may be an extension of that we don't know.
[02:05:51.920 --> 02:05:55.760]   Let me give you a thought experiment. What if we could, using machine learning,
[02:05:55.760 --> 02:06:01.520]   create an AI that had perfect diagnostic capabilities? Right now, you rely on your physician,
[02:06:01.520 --> 02:06:07.360]   and your physician's imperfect memory of everything she learned in college, in medical school,
[02:06:07.360 --> 02:06:12.240]   reading textbooks, reading journals, and, of course, memory is far from perfect, so she might
[02:06:12.240 --> 02:06:18.320]   well miss a symptom. It happens all the time, but the AI never does. It's 100% perfect, but you
[02:06:18.320 --> 02:06:24.080]   don't know how it works. Which would you choose? I mean, definitely the latter.
[02:06:24.080 --> 02:06:24.560]   Yeah. Yeah.
[02:06:24.560 --> 02:06:32.400]   I had things better. Yeah. Even if the AI gave you a poor credit score because you're a woman,
[02:06:32.400 --> 02:06:33.920]   at least it would know if you're going to die.
[02:06:33.920 --> 02:06:39.760]   Okay, let me give you one more, though. What if that continues to happen, and this is what
[02:06:39.760 --> 02:06:44.720]   we're talking about about computers getting beyond us? So Leo, you say I trust the AI, I trust the
[02:06:44.720 --> 02:06:50.240]   AI for A, B, and C, and D, then what happens when you're a decade down the line, and you have
[02:06:50.240 --> 02:06:54.720]   absolutely no idea how anything works, you're a human being, and you're basically in the
[02:06:54.720 --> 02:06:58.640]   Wale universe where the computer's just running there. We're already there.
[02:06:58.640 --> 02:07:05.840]   The number of people who know how to make a cell phone, make a smartphone, is infinitesimal.
[02:07:05.840 --> 02:07:11.040]   If anything should happen to them, we're screwed. I often think about that. If you go back in
[02:07:11.040 --> 02:07:16.960]   time, say, 50 years, and just explain the technology we have, then it's like, and people
[02:07:16.960 --> 02:07:22.000]   be like, that's awesome. Tell us how it works. No idea. But you don't stop doing it just because
[02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:27.840]   you can't explain it. Listen, this is my father-in-law's argument to me every year at Christmas when
[02:07:27.840 --> 02:07:34.880]   he uses Flint to make a fire and humiliates me by being a mountain man that knows how to do that.
[02:07:34.880 --> 02:07:40.400]   God willing someday will live in a world where no man has to use Flint to make a fire.
[02:07:40.400 --> 02:07:46.320]   Thank you so much, Brian McCullough, for being here. He is, of course, the host of the Tech Mead
[02:07:46.320 --> 02:07:51.920]   Ride Home and author of, what is the name of your internet history book? I'm sorry, I'm drawing.
[02:07:51.920 --> 02:07:54.400]   How the internet happened. That's it. How the internet happened?
[02:07:54.400 --> 02:08:00.000]   But just check out the internet history. The Tech meme ride home, we're hitting our 50-500th
[02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:03.360]   episode. Nice. You're going to beat us. You're catching up with us.
[02:08:03.360 --> 02:08:10.720]   Yeah. What are you? 745. So I'll beat you within a year. That's what happens when you do five shows
[02:08:11.760 --> 02:08:18.000]   a week. I do 25 shows a month. You do 7 in some weeks. You'll do a show every day in some weeks.
[02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:26.880]   Stupid overachiever. I bet you don't smoke a pot. Not no while. Daniel Robino, he is the
[02:08:26.880 --> 02:08:33.040]   executive editor when he gets around to it of Windows Central. Now we know why you have so many
[02:08:33.040 --> 02:08:37.280]   game controllers. You just forgot you bought one. I barely gained nothing.
[02:08:38.080 --> 02:08:43.280]   No worse pothead. I don't even think. I'm teasing you. I'm just teasing you. Nothing wrong with it.
[02:08:43.280 --> 02:08:49.200]   It's completely legal in some states. It's always good to have you, Daniel. Good job at Windows
[02:08:49.200 --> 02:08:53.120]   Central. We always love having you on the show. Both of you, Brian and Daniel. Of course, Brianna
[02:08:53.120 --> 02:08:59.120]   Wu, we love you. She is running for Congress in the Massachusetts 8th. If you live in them,
[02:08:59.120 --> 02:09:03.840]   there you go. What's the website? It's Brianna Wu for Congress. That's an easy one.
[02:09:03.840 --> 02:09:10.080]   Doc on. Doc on at Brianna Wu. All three of you always are a pleasure to have on the show.
[02:09:10.080 --> 02:09:15.040]   Thank you for being here. It was a great way to come back and get back in the saddle and catch up.
[02:09:15.040 --> 02:09:20.080]   I'll be honest with you. None of these stories that I read do I know about. It all happened
[02:09:20.080 --> 02:09:24.960]   while I was gone. I'm glad I had some smart brains to explain it all for me. Thank you.
[02:09:24.960 --> 02:09:31.120]   Yeah, we do the show Sundays and I'll be back from now on. I'm never leaving again because those
[02:09:31.120 --> 02:09:36.400]   other people did too good a job. We do this show Sundays right after the radio show. It's about
[02:09:36.400 --> 02:09:44.720]   230 Pacific 530 Eastern. It's now I believe because we're in daylight. We're in standard time now,
[02:09:44.720 --> 02:09:52.240]   right? So it's 2200? It is. It's 2200. It's 230. There about? Yeah, 2215 depending on how long
[02:09:52.240 --> 02:10:00.000]   it takes me to walk. If Carson lost his vape pen, it'll be a little earlier.
[02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:07.040]   No, I'm just kidding. We do the show live and you can watch it live at twitter.tv/live.
[02:10:07.040 --> 02:10:10.640]   That's our live audio and video streams. You can also be in studio. We love having a studio audience.
[02:10:10.640 --> 02:10:16.320]   We have people visiting. Actually, it's really interesting people. Brian is here. He's a
[02:10:17.120 --> 02:10:22.880]   former JPL programmer, worked on Voyager and then just completely coincidentally, Tony and Adam,
[02:10:22.880 --> 02:10:33.520]   who worked for NASA. They fly the NASA High Altitude Research plane, the WB57F, 60,000 feet.
[02:10:33.520 --> 02:10:39.040]   That's right where the sky starts to disappear, right? It starts to turn black. That's amazing.
[02:10:39.040 --> 02:10:45.280]   That's great. Great to have you, all of you, and Jim and Elaine from Tucson. Jim was also here.
[02:10:45.280 --> 02:10:50.160]   It's great to have you all. If you want to join us in studio, email tickets at twit.tv. We'll make
[02:10:50.160 --> 02:10:58.720]   sure there's a chair and a vape pen ready for you. No, we do not provide vape pens. If you want to
