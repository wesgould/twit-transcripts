[00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.520]   It's time for Twit this week in tech.
[00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.040]   We're going to talk about the week's tech news.
[00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.760]   And golly, gosh, there's a ton of it.
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.280]   And a great panel to do so, starting off to my far left,
[00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.160]   Blanche Ulanoff is here, formerly editor in chief of PC
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.840]   magazine, now editor in chief of Mashable.com.
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.160]   Great to see you, Blanche.
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.120]   Thanks for having me.
[00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.360]   And you're in New York today?
[00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.320]   Yes, I'm in New York every day.
[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.800]   Every day.
[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:02.120]   Pretty much.
[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.360]   Unless there's something going on,
[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.440]   and I've got to go somewhere.
[00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:05.600]   I know somebody who's not in New York,
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.160]   because she's sitting right next to me, Alexia.
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.000]   So it says from techcrunch.com.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.800]   See you in the heart of Silicon Valley.
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.720]   Silicon Valley.
[00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:12.960]   Great to have you back, Alexia.
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:13.560]   Thanks for being here.
[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.720]   Thank you.
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.040]   Really love having you on.
[00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.080]   As I do this guy, Mr. Roger Chang, one
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.480]   of the original Twitters, Twits, hers.
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.680]   You know, I hate Siri, because every time I say Twit,
[00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.760]   it changes it to Twitter.
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:25.240]   Oh, what do you--
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.760]   That's bad.
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.400]   Or maybe you can train Siri to--
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.400]   No, you can't.
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.320]   Siri's untrainable.
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:31.320]   No.
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.400]   She pooped on my carpet last night.
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.600]   Roger Chang-- oh, look at this double box.
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.000]   As if Roger's not sitting right there.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.200]   Go ahead and put your--
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.800]   Roger's with techzilla.com.
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.680]   His job, Wrangling Patrick Norton.
[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:47.680]   It's not an easy job.
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.080]   No, it's a full-time job.
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.240]   Even off the clock.
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.120]   Yep.
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.600]   And then to your right, we welcome--
[00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:55.840]   I think for the first time on Twit,
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.040]   you've been on TNT many times.
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.440]   Tim Stevens, editor of the Chief of Engadget.
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.400]   Thank you very much for having me.
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.200]   Great to have you, Tim, from up in New York State.
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:03.640]   I am.
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.760]   I hardly know where to begin today.
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.200]   We're going to rush this because Lance and Tim
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.800]   want to leave in one hour to watch 60 minutes,
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.560]   because it's the Steve Jobs episode.
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.920]   In fact, Walter Isaacson, who is the author of the new Steve
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.920]   Jobs biography, is going to be on 60 minutes.
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.880]   And apparently, there'll be multiple revelations,
[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.480]   many of which have already leaked.
[00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.280]   You were saying, Lance, I don't know if there's going to be anything new.
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.680]   We already know already everything is going to say.
[00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:30.080]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.400]   The 60 minutes crew has been releasing little tidbits
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.280]   over the past week.
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.520]   And some of the stuff we had heard before--
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.440]   you know what I realized as they were releasing some of his comments
[00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.880]   and his sentiments about Microsoft being
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.240]   unimaginative and what he really thought of Bill Gates--
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:50.000]   is that right after Steve Jobs died,
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.480]   and it's quite natural to do this,
[00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.280]   people kind of took a very rosy view of him.
[00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.480]   Yes.
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.920]   Even though-- I mean, we all knew--
[00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.320]   we've worked with Apple.
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.960]   Some of us had a new Steve Jobs or interacted with them in some way.
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.400]   And we understood that he was a tough businessman and sometimes
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.160]   an easy guy.
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.440]   But you almost forgot that for about a week or so.
[00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.440]   And now, some of these comments are coming back.
[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.040]   There's a reason he was so successful.
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.040]   I mean, he took no prisoners.
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.240]   He always admitted stealing some of the best ideas,
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.360]   whatever he saw.
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.440]   Competition, he was talking about crushing it.
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.680]   I wanted to crush Android.
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.480]   Thought it was a stolen product.
[00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.720]   These things, he's a guy who went his own way his whole life.
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.000]   So it shouldn't be a big surprise.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.320]   But I'm hoping that there's one or two revelations left in this report.
[00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.040]   Isaac's in on 60 Minutes says he's not of Steve Jobs.
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.040]   He's not warm and fuzzy.
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.640]   He was very petulant.
[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:45.720]   He was very brittle.
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.440]   He could be very, very mean to people at times.
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:50.760]   It's really a one-two punch.
[00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:51.120]   You're right.
[00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.800]   We had the eulogy, the hagiography last week.
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.560]   And now we get the other side of Steve Jobs.
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.040]   And it's not pretty in many ways.
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.640]   It's not pretty.
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.360]   I mean, saying things like, I don't care how much--
[00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.200]   he says to Eric Schmidt, apparently, in that famous meeting
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.320]   in Palo Alto at the coffee shop, it's not about money.
[00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:12.720]   You could give me $5 billion.
[00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:13.800]   I got plenty of money.
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.600]   I want to crush Android.
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.040]   I'm going to use every--
[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:20.480]   until my dying breath and every penny of Apple's $40 billion
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.800]   in cash to crush Android.
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.360]   You know what's amazing about that?
[00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.960]   I mean, if you read interviews from early jobs,
[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:32.240]   he quotes Picasso and says, good artists, copy great artists,
[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.240]   steal--
[00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.040]   But not for me.
[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.960]   --not for me.
[00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.480]   It's such a hypocritical stance towards the end of his life,
[00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.880]   which makes you think like most successful people.
[00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.040]   But he sounds like kind of an asshole.
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.080]   Well, you see, that's the thing.
[00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.640]   I don't think he can't--
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:47.640]   I think he always was.
[00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:49.160]   I mean, you have to be--
[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.520]   I think you do have to be a little hard--
[00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.720]   play hardball when you get into a business where--
[00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.000]   But are you making an excuse for him?
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.800]   Do you think that his behavior is--
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.360]   I'm not saying that it's good or bad.
[00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.520]   I'm saying that he--
[00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.200]   I don't think he was this nice, you know, care-bear guy
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:06.600]   that sounded like he was definitely no care-bear guy.
[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.360]   That turned into this kind of--
[00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:11.160]   And if anything, he may be mellowed towards the end.
[00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:12.640]   Well, what's interesting is--
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:13.720]   Go ahead, Lance.
[00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.080]   I was just going to say, maybe mellowed
[00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:16.760]   or maybe he's been 100% consistent.
[00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:20.160]   I mean, I think the way he worked was that he believed--
[00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.600]   for his business, it was good to see good ideas,
[00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:29.080]   going to Xerox, seeing an interface, a graphical interface,
[00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.280]   and stealing and going and making something better,
[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.320]   seeing the mouse and making it usable.
[00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:36.640]   But he's OK with other people copying his ideas,
[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:39.400]   as long as they don't become too successful doing so.
[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:40.320]   And that was really it.
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:43.680]   Once he saw them rise to the level of a threat,
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.400]   he said, OK, game's over now.
[00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:47.000]   We're done playing.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.320]   You took my stuff.
[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:49.680]   You're becoming successful.
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:50.760]   I'm going to go after you.
[00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:52.920]   I'm going to crush you, because this is how you do business.
[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:53.920]   This is how you went.
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:58.640]   He used the term thermonuclear war on Android.
[00:06:58.640 --> 00:06:59.680]   Wow.
[00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:02.000]   And that's what we're seeing with the Apple Samsung lawsuits.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.200]   It's take no prisoners.
[00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:06.320]   In fact, they want to put Samsung out of business.
[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:07.760]   They certainly have done so in some places.
[00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:09.600]   Germany and Australia, so far.
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.760]   Doesn't Samsung supply some of the components?
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:12.760]   Well, that's the funniest thing.
[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:13.760]   Absolutely.
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:15.200]   Samsung provides many of the parts for this.
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:15.720]   Game of answer.
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:16.640]   One part.
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:19.520]   It's shocking to me, though, that with all these revelations
[00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:22.080]   that Apple really hasn't gone after Android in particular.
[00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:24.040]   Right now, they're only picking on Samsung.
[00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:26.920]   So it's surprising to me that with all this coming out,
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:29.920]   that we haven't seen any legal action directly against Google.
[00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:31.440]   Maybe that's coming in the future.
[00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:33.240]   Or maybe Tim Cook has a different opinion on things.
[00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:35.040]   It's lawsuit by proxy, probably.
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:36.640]   And I imagine that the plan was.
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:37.480]   And I don't know.
[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:38.360]   That's a good point, Tim.
[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:40.600]   I don't know if it will change now on her Tim Cook.
[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:46.400]   Maybe Tim will-- it's one thing to take everything personally
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:47.240]   to have it be a grudge.
[00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:52.160]   But once you get into business like politics,
[00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.080]   as you point out, Roger, they work with Samsung.
[00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:57.320]   You kind of have to maybe take some of the personal stuff out
[00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:57.880]   of it.
[00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:01.200]   What's interesting is that in the Huffington Post article,
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:04.320]   Jobs had an opportunity to meet with Obama.
[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:06.480]   And he initially turned it down because he wanted
[00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:10.560]   a personal invitation from the president directly to him.
[00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:14.680]   And his wife Lorraine said, the president wants to meet you,
[00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:17.360]   Steve, and see, says, well, he can call me.
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:17.880]   Right.
[00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:19.080]   And then he told--
[00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:21.120]   And then he said, stay standoff where they were just
[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.360]   playing kind of powerful person chicken.
[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:24.440]   I have ordered the book.
[00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:25.680]   I have it overnighted.
[00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:26.400]   I want it to mark it.
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:28.880]   None of-- nobody's seen it except I guess AP has seen it.
[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:29.760]   Any of you seen it?
[00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:30.680]   Having been posted.
[00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:31.680]   Seeing it.
[00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:32.680]   I have seen it.
[00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:33.680]   I have seen it.
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:37.840]   I tried to get people to go to bookstores
[00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:39.080]   and try to--
[00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:40.280]   Rifles through the boxes.
[00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:40.840]   No, it's not.
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:42.280]   Because everyone still hasn't installed.
[00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:43.080]   Everyone hasn't.
[00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:44.520]   It's in the back.
[00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:45.440]   But that didn't work.
[00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:47.160]   Going to bookstores and saying, hey,
[00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:49.080]   you want to give me a copy?
[00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:50.760]   They've done a better job of keeping this secret
[00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:52.680]   than they did the Harry Potter books.
[00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:54.280]   I mean, we're going to put a case and think out,
[00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:56.080]   like, monically.
[00:08:56.080 --> 00:09:00.480]   People would scan in those books and end up on BitTorrent.
[00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.840]   But the Steve Jobs book somehow--
[00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:03.880]   this is his legacy.
[00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:06.240]   He can still control things from beyond the grave.
[00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:06.760]   It's amazing.
[00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:08.120]   He somehow managed--
[00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:10.240]   and just, like, every product released.
[00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:11.240]   And yet--
[00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:12.320]   The iPhone 4S still.
[00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:14.640]   I mean, we knew more about that than we did about this book.
[00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:15.160]   Yeah.
[00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:15.160]   Well--
[00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:17.120]   We didn't know that it was a 4S and not a 5.
[00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:17.640]   Right.
[00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:18.160]   Right.
[00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:18.960]   That was a 1-bit old--
[00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:19.520]   Should we know that?
[00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:19.920]   No.
[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:20.440]   No.
[00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:21.160]   You're absolutely not.
[00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:22.000]   We weren't sure what was going to happen.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.480]   I bet you actually had a 5 still made up.
[00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:26.080]   And then at the last month, I'll just call it a--
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:28.520]   Well, that's one thing that apparently people are saying.
[00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:30.200]   I know, and Gadget was saying this--
[00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:31.680]   or I'm sorry, Cena was saying this,
[00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:35.680]   that Steve's real legacy will be the iPhone 5, not the 4S.
[00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:36.680]   I don't know if I believe that.
[00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:39.560]   I think everything that Apple did from the leather
[00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:42.220]   in the van that drives employees from San Francisco
[00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:45.320]   to Cupertino was overseen directly by Steve Jobs.
[00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:48.200]   So I can't believe that a 4S came out without Steve's input.
[00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:49.600]   Here's the thing I find funny.
[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:56.160]   This book actually has a leak of the next Apple big thing.
[00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:59.360]   And in a very un-jobs-y in way, Steve Jobs told
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:03.440]   Isaacson that the next thing was TV.
[00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:05.680]   And this, we'd heard so many rumors for years.
[00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:07.600]   Started with Jason Calicand, it was two years ago.
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:12.000]   Is it Apple's going to do a big screen HD TV?
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:12.920]   We kept hearing rumors.
[00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:14.880]   We thought even maybe it would be this time.
[00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:17.600]   Tim, what do we know about this Apple TV?
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.120]   What is it going to be?
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:20.440]   We don't really know anything.
[00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:23.440]   But yeah, we've absolutely been hearing these rumors since--
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:24.800]   like you said, for years now.
[00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:26.320]   And each time we have a big Apple event,
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:28.360]   we always wonder, well, maybe this will be the day
[00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:29.720]   that we see the Apple TV.
[00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:33.440]   There's an Apple TV device, but not an actual Apple TV,
[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:35.520]   a TV with an Apple logo on it.
[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:38.280]   So it's interesting to hear that all these rumors actually
[00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:39.240]   have something solid.
[00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:41.640]   There are some-- there's something solid behind all
[00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:43.120]   this talk we've heard for years.
[00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:45.280]   So maybe an Apple's next big event
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:47.160]   will finally see this big screen TV that's
[00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:49.840]   white with an Apple on the side.
[00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:51.800]   I thought we had already seen the Apple TV.
[00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:52.800]   Isn't it an iMac?
[00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:55.160]   I mean, the 24-inch--
[00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:55.680]   It's true.
[00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:57.920]   --this big thing, which is exactly like a TV.
[00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:00.880]   And that Apple TV device, you remember, it got so small,
[00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:01.920]   right?
[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:05.480]   And it's smaller once you tear off the hard casing.
[00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:09.280]   That slips right inside any TV--
[00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:11.000]   any Apple TV product.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.960]   It's so simple for them to do.
[00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:14.600]   But the question is--
[00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:16.880]   and I think this is the reason it's taken so long as--
[00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:18.680]   Apple's been trying to decide whether or not it
[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:20.800]   wants to be in that market.
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:23.720]   Is it the kind of market where they can really control things?
[00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:26.160]   Can they get the right distribution,
[00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:28.120]   the right visibility, and best buy?
[00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:30.760]   Well, best buy say, yeah, Apple TV, same way
[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:31.880]   as with the other Apple products.
[00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:33.720]   We're going to do something special for you.
[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:36.560]   Because there's a lot invested by those other partners
[00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:38.600]   who have a different relationship with Best Buy than,
[00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:40.440]   say, like an HP or someone else.
[00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:44.040]   So I think that that, for me, is the final hurdle there.
[00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:46.000]   As Washington Post had the story, of course,
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.520]   they called the Apple TV--
[00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:49.960]   Steve called it a hobby.
[00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:52.840]   But according to the biography, quote,
[00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:56.080]   "he very much wanted to do for television sets what
[00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:58.720]   he had done for computers, music players, and iPhones.
[00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:00.920]   Make them simple and elegant."
[00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:03.360]   Job said, quote, "I'd like to create an integrated
[00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:05.440]   television set that is integrated,
[00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:08.040]   meaning exactly what you said, Lance, Apple TV,
[00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:11.360]   in a TV screen, that is completely easy to use.
[00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:13.320]   Quote, "It would be seamlessly synced
[00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:16.240]   with all of your devices and with iCloud.
[00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:18.680]   No longer would users have to fiddle with complex remotes
[00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:21.000]   for DVD players and cable channels."
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.640]   And this is the quote that I think-- this is the money quote.
[00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:26.240]   This is the one more thing from the grave.
[00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:28.800]   "It will have the simplest user interface you could imagine.
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:31.280]   I finally cracked it," said Steve Jobs.
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:32.960]   That means I got it figured out.
[00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:34.840]   We got it.
[00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:37.880]   I have to say, I was very skeptical
[00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:39.280]   about that there could possibly
[00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:40.240]   be thinking about a TV.
[00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:42.160]   What a terrible business for Apple to get into.
[00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:45.480]   So I mean, at all things D when Jobs referred to it
[00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:48.600]   most famously as a hobby in 2010--
[00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:49.400]   The little thing.
[00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:50.600]   --he said, TV's a hobby.
[00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:53.040]   Smarter people than us will figure it out.
[00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:53.320]   Right.
[00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:55.160]   But Jobs has a history of saying this stuff.
[00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:56.920]   I mean, before the iPhone, he said
[00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:59.520]   that phone carriers were hard to deal with.
[00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:02.640]   Before the video iPod, he said, I'm
[00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:06.360]   not convinced people want to watch movies on a tiny screen.
[00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:08.240]   So he's like-- he's managing expectations.
[00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:08.800]   It was disinformation.
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:09.320]   Well, yeah.
[00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:13.080]   It's the Jobsian reality of distortion.
[00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:14.760]   I like Jobsian.
[00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:16.320]   Will that live beyond him?
[00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:19.240]   Will that something we'll still be using 20 years down the line?
[00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:20.560]   Hey, that's totally Jobsian.
[00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:21.080]   Yeah.
[00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:22.440]   What does that mean?
[00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:23.680]   The question is, what will it mean?
[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:24.960]   Will it mean Machiavellian?
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:25.800]   Will it mean evil?
[00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:28.320]   Will it mean life is nasty, brutish, and short?
[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:29.200]   And I am the king.
[00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:31.040]   What will Jobsian mean?
[00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:32.000]   Listen to these quotes.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.720]   This is, again, from 60 minutes at Walter Isis
[00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:36.680]   in talking.
[00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:38.840]   He says he could be very mean to people at all times,
[00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:41.080]   whether it was to a waitress in a restaurant or a guy who
[00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:42.520]   would state up all night coding.
[00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:45.480]   He could just really go at them and say, you're doing this all
[00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:45.980]   wrong.
[00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:47.280]   It's horrible.
[00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:49.000]   And you'd say, why did you do that?
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:49.760]   Why weren't you nicer?
[00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:51.680]   And he'd say, I really want to be with people
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:52.280]   who demand perfection.
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:53.920]   And this is who I am.
[00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:57.200]   Isaacson says he got it from his adopted father.
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:01.120]   Paul Jobs, he tells the story once they were building a fence.
[00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:03.520]   And he said, you've got to make the back of the fence
[00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:05.440]   that no one will see, just as good looking
[00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:07.000]   as the front of the fence.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.880]   That will show you're dedicated to making something perfect.
[00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:14.560]   He also said, Jobs could have been one of the world's worst
[00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:15.120]   managers.
[00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:16.680]   Now, I think there's no question.
[00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:19.640]   And John Louis Gesset says this in his blog,
[00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:23.800]   that Apple's one of the best run companies out there.
[00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:24.960]   And maybe that's Tim Cook.
[00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:27.120]   Maybe that's others.
[00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:30.600]   Isaacson says he was always upending things,
[00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:32.800]   throwing things into turmoil.
[00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:34.800]   They made great products, or it made great products,
[00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:37.560]   but it didn't make for a great management style.
[00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:39.720]   Well, what's more important?
[00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:41.400]   Management or leadership?
[00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:44.560]   I think that Steve Jobs may not have been a good manager,
[00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:47.160]   because it wasn't a people person.
[00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:49.360]   He didn't suffer fools gladly.
[00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:53.560]   But as a leader, a decision maker,
[00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:55.840]   I think he was one of the top ones.
[00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:57.240]   And he surrounded his people.
[00:14:57.240 --> 00:15:00.360]   Great leaders surround themselves with great people.
[00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:02.320]   So they can get things done.
[00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:04.880]   His collection-- and this is why I've said over and over again
[00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:07.480]   that Apple will be fine, because he surrounded himself
[00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:09.480]   with top-notch people who understood what to do,
[00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:14.080]   who understood how to execute, and realize Steve Jobs' vision,
[00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:17.200]   and sometimes improve upon it or expand it.
[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:21.640]   So I think when we talk about managers, managers
[00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:23.840]   are sometimes just thinking about how do you manage people,
[00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:26.760]   how do you make them feel, and clearly, Steve Jobs
[00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:28.880]   care about who he made people feel.
[00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:29.360]   Right.
[00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:31.520]   He talks about all the money people made
[00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:34.120]   in the early days of Apple, and he said they'd buy big houses,
[00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:38.040]   big cars, get face, you know, get--
[00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:38.680]   Plastic surgery.
[00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:39.640]   Plastic surgery.
[00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:40.200]   Yeah.
[00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:42.160]   And he says, I don't want to be like that.
[00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:43.960]   Well, maybe it is the Machiavellian,
[00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:46.960]   do the ends justify the means.
[00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:50.080]   Does the fact that my phone is this amazingly slick computer,
[00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:52.440]   justify the fact that Jobs made a bunch of people at Apple
[00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:53.600]   cry?
[00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:54.240]   Maybe.
[00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:55.240]   Well, no.
[00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:58.160]   I mean, he was a perfectionist.
[00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:01.840]   So it stands to reason that in everything he does,
[00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:04.240]   when he interacts with him, he probably demands
[00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:06.280]   a similar level of competence.
[00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:06.920]   Right.
[00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:11.200]   You know, it's not out of the realm of reason to be--
[00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:13.120]   He seems really arbitrary.
[00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:15.880]   Like when he told John Doar that his dinner
[00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:20.080]   menu was too fancy, and he didn't want to have a cream pie
[00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:21.560]   because he thought that was--
[00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:23.000]   This is for the Obama dinner.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.840]   And then Obama, again, the Obama Jobs power struggle
[00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:26.840]   was amazing.
[00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:28.640]   He has the nerve to say to President Obama,
[00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:30.800]   I'm going to do your campaign ads for 2012,
[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:31.640]   because these ads suck.
[00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:33.080]   You're going to be a one-term president.
[00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:34.080]   One term is an activist.
[00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:35.000]   You don't have too many--
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.800]   His biggest problem with Obama is people don't dislike you
[00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:38.560]   enough.
[00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:41.760]   People need to dislike you more arbitrary.
[00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:43.000]   That's Jobsian.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.280]   There are people in this world who
[00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:46.600]   don't understand other people's feelings.
[00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:47.440]   They don't--
[00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:48.480]   They actually have this--
[00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:50.200]   They're called sociopaths.
[00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:53.560]   Well, no, no, no, sociopaths are people who don't care.
[00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:54.000]   They're called--
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.080]   They're like Asperger's.
[00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:56.440]   Is it like Asperger's syndrome?
[00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:58.440]   Well, I think it's the same thing as not understanding
[00:16:58.440 --> 00:16:59.240]   people's feelings.
[00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:00.440]   Yeah, I just like it's like--
[00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:00.920]   It's like--
[00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:01.440]   Hold on.
[00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:02.760]   It's like Dexter.
[00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:03.680]   We got a fly in there.
[00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:04.960]   We have a fly.
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:06.840]   I don't understand that fly's feelings.
[00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:08.000]   I'm going to kill it.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.200]   It's like Dexter.
[00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:11.440]   You know that there are feelings.
[00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:12.920]   You can even understand that the feelings exist,
[00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:14.360]   but you don't share those feelings.
[00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:15.200]   You don't relate to them.
[00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:15.840]   You don't relate.
[00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:16.640]   You don't have them.
[00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:17.140]   I can't appreciate--
[00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:18.160]   Do you think Jobs is a--
[00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:18.880]   Now, this is--
[00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:20.080]   Talk about--
[00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:21.000]   Go and eat here.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.400]   Post-Hawk psychology.
[00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:24.000]   It was Jobs's sociopath.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:24.640]   Chat room?
[00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:25.200]   Yeah.
[00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:25.720]   Question.
[00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:26.720]   Oh, geez.
[00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:27.720]   No.
[00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:28.400]   I don't know.
[00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:30.640]   Could you build products like that without having empathy,
[00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:31.140]   though?
[00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:33.440]   I mean, his whole thing was bringing the humanities
[00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:37.200]   and the arts and things that deal specifically with emotion.
[00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:40.360]   If he was a sociopath, he was the one that really had
[00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:42.400]   an intricate understanding of human emotion,
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:44.200]   or you couldn't build these kind of things.
[00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:44.680]   These are like--
[00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:46.280]   But sociopath's are notorious for that.
[00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:48.280]   They can manipulate people.
[00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:48.760]   Ah.
[00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:49.920]   He built what he loved, right?
[00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:53.000]   Then he built-- each time the products that he built
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.320]   were ones that he wanted.
[00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:55.840]   It was always about what does Steve want?
[00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:57.480]   What would Steve use?
[00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:01.280]   And a lot of-- he actually said he didn't spend time
[00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:03.640]   studying the consumer audience.
[00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:05.520]   He didn't go out there and market test things.
[00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:07.480]   He said, this is what appeals to me.
[00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:08.960]   And if it appeals to me, well, certainly it's
[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:10.280]   going to appeal to the rest of the world.
[00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:14.280]   He had what you would call excellent taste.
[00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:15.880]   You know, we were talking before the show.
[00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:19.000]   He did have excellent designer's eye, designer's taste.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.520]   But I was--
[00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:21.520]   I've been thinking about all this.
[00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:24.080]   And one thing that kind of bugs me--
[00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:25.960]   Max have notoriously been bad.
[00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:31.040]   They have the worst sound effects of any computer in history.
[00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:35.440]   The stupid-ass sound effects you can choose from on OS X,
[00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:38.760]   even the latest version of Lion, these sound effects
[00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:39.280]   are crap.
[00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:41.600]   And I'm starting to think that, among other things,
[00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:44.360]   he had a great eye, but he had no ear.
[00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:45.560]   These are the worst--
[00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:47.440]   Do purring, because that's hilarious.
[00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:51.240]   Purring is this-- who thinks this is a good sound effect?
[00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:52.760]   That's so summy.
[00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:54.360]   But this is Lion.
[00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:57.040]   Yes, these are the same as in System 7's.
[00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:58.120]   Excuse me.
[00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:02.800]   That you could have hired Bono for crying out loud.
[00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:03.760]   He never played with me.
[00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:04.520]   He always said great.
[00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:06.320]   This event, he always said great musicians.
[00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:07.760]   So it's odd, right?
[00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:08.360]   He liked music.
[00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:09.520]   He liked music.
[00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:11.760]   And I forget the name of the other--
[00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:12.760]   John Meyer.
[00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:13.760]   What a--
[00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:15.640]   Who are you also criticized?
[00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:16.480]   Did he?
[00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:17.320]   What do you say about that?
[00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:18.360]   He said he's out of control.
[00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:19.360]   Chuffs a lot of people.
[00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:20.800]   When you're out of control, at what point?
[00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:21.840]   I have no idea.
[00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:24.880]   He just said that he's a good artist, but he's out of control.
[00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:26.640]   He's basically a mess.
[00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:29.400]   Even if they had Kanye West on the stage of one
[00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:32.240]   of these announcements, and he thinks John Meyer is out of control.
[00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:33.720]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:36.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:37.360]   This book is portrayed.
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:37.880]   I can't wait.
[00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:40.400]   It's like a very gussop-be-pedi person.
[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:41.320]   OK, show of hands.
[00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:43.240]   How many of you set aside the entire day tomorrow
[00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:44.400]   just to read this book?
[00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:45.800]   600 pages.
[00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:46.760]   That's all I'm going to do.
[00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:47.560]   All right, the book.
[00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:48.060]   Yeah.
[00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:49.880]   I can't do that.
[00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:51.080]   My little rhyme on my--
[00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:53.280]   I guess it'll arrive on my Kindle tomorrow, right?
[00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:54.280]   Yeah.
[00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:55.360]   Well, that's a good idea.
[00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:57.280]   If you pre-ordered it, I guess it'd arrive at midnight.
[00:19:57.280 --> 00:20:01.160]   Is reading this thing on a Kindle, Lance?
[00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:03.000]   Do you think it's kind of--
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:03.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:04.400]   Right.
[00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:05.240]   You know what'll happen?
[00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:05.720]   Like someone's--
[00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:06.560]   Someone's having some religious.
[00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:08.480]   Someone's having some religious.
[00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:09.880]   It actually won't work, right?
[00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:12.800]   And then I'll get a face and eink of Steve Jobs saying,
[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:14.640]   what are you doing?
[00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:16.640]   This product sucks.
[00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:17.640]   Stop reading.
[00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:18.640]   Stop reading.
[00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:19.640]   I kind of--
[00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:20.640]   Give you a high-pitched--
[00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:21.640]   Too fast.
[00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:22.640]   --as a general and I've had to.
[00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:24.120]   Oh, man.
[00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:29.240]   You know, every person is a patchwork, good and bad mix.
[00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:32.040]   And of course, there's no way Steve Jobs was the perfect human
[00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:32.560]   being.
[00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:34.560]   It might have sounded that way the day he died.
[00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:35.640]   We talked a lot about him.
[00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:36.880]   We did about eight hours.
[00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:39.800]   But of course, he was a rich experience.
[00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:40.800]   And I think--
[00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:41.280]   Rich.
[00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:44.000]   I'm not going to make excuses for him.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.760]   But at the same time, none of us is perfect.
[00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:48.200]   He was who he was.
[00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:48.720]   And I think--
[00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:49.200]   He was who he was.
[00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:51.920]   The problem is, especially after someone passes away,
[00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:56.000]   everyone tends to brush away anything negative because it
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.520]   seems rather unkind to someone who just died.
[00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:02.040]   Not to be ill of the dead, right?
[00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:05.760]   And so people tended to keep praise upon praise
[00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:07.720]   because they feel that's the right thing to do.
[00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:09.400]   And you know, you're going to be a jerk.
[00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:14.440]   You've said, well, yeah, he was a great a-hole to half his company.
[00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:16.040]   And he wouldn't listen to reason.
[00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:16.960]   He argued with the president--
[00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:19.320]   or he wanted to argue with the president about his campaign
[00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:20.520]   in 2012.
[00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:26.160]   It's all these things that, over time, pick any public figure
[00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:27.800]   and immediately when they--
[00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:29.320]   Reagan, when he passed away, everyone
[00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:34.240]   was giving him high praise, even though 10 years before that,
[00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:35.320]   people were like, well, gee, it's
[00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:37.120]   Reaganomics really screwed over the country.
[00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:39.280]   And that's why Ketchup was labeled as a vegetable.
[00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:44.120]   It's interesting because we had Landry Connie of the Cult
[00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:45.880]   of Mac on that day.
[00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:48.000]   And he was saying some of the negative things.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.680]   And everybody was a little bit shocked
[00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:51.200]   because there is that kind of idea.
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:52.800]   You don't say anything bad about the dead.
[00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:56.160]   In fact, it's a Latin saying, de mortuis nillnessy bonem.
[00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:56.840]   But--
[00:21:56.840 --> 00:21:57.680]   Wow.
[00:21:57.680 --> 00:21:58.680]   But--
[00:21:58.680 --> 00:21:59.880]   Hard for it, but--
[00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:03.680]   But apparently in Britain, the standards for obituaries
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:04.920]   are very different than here in the US.
[00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:06.960]   In the US, we tend to just say the good things.
[00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:09.440]   In Britain, they love to bring up the dirt.
[00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:11.520]   And that's what Landry is British, of course.
[00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:13.200]   And we're going to take a break and come back with more.
[00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:14.320]   What a great panel.
[00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:15.720]   We're going to rush through all the next stories
[00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:17.200]   so you guys can go watch 60 minutes.
[00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:19.240]   Lance Unlanoff is here, editor-in-chief
[00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:21.400]   of Mashable Magazine, Alexia Tzotz.
[00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:22.040]   Am I saying it?
[00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:22.920]   So Tzotz is right?
[00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:23.720]   So Tzotz is fine.
[00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:24.080]   So Tzotz.
[00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:25.240]   You ask me every time.
[00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:27.520]   I don't feel like it doesn't sound right.
[00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:29.120]   I like to-- yeah, it doesn't sound right.
[00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:30.040]   But that's how it sounds.
[00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:30.720]   It sounds right to you.
[00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:31.520]   Yeah, I mean--
[00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:32.280]   It is my name.
[00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:34.160]   I saw your passport from 10 years ago.
[00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:37.160]   It's so cute to see your new passport.
[00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:38.720]   I was growing out a shaved head.
[00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:39.760]   Is that what it was?
[00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:40.920]   Because you had a little curly--
[00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:41.720]   It was just like a head?
[00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:42.480]   You had shaved it?
[00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:42.840]   Yes.
[00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:44.640]   I was a very rebellious kid.
[00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:45.640]   Wow.
[00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:47.160]   You saw Chanel at O'Connor do that,
[00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:48.520]   and you said, I want to look like Chanel.
[00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:51.840]   I just didn't like hair.
[00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:52.960]   But it was really gross.
[00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:53.320]   You know?
[00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:55.320]   Grace is the hot place.
[00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:56.160]   And you were in Grace.
[00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:57.160]   I was in Grace.
[00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:57.920]   Did you grow up in Athens?
[00:22:57.920 --> 00:22:58.680]   Where'd you grow up?
[00:22:58.680 --> 00:22:59.240]   In Athens.
[00:22:59.240 --> 00:22:59.760]   In Athens.
[00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:00.360]   The big city.
[00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:00.960]   The big city.
[00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:01.480]   Wow.
[00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:03.320]   Probably a lot of people shave their heads in Athens.
[00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:04.960]   A lot of guys shave their heads in Athens.
[00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:05.440]   Not many women.
[00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:06.040]   Not many women.
[00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:06.920]   Nope.
[00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:08.840]   Alexia is a writer for TechCrunch.
[00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:09.920]   I'll tell you how dedicated she is.
[00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:12.160]   She just blogged like five minutes ago.
[00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:13.240]   No, I didn't just blog.
[00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:13.760]   You didn't post it?
[00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:14.640]   I wasn't fast enough.
[00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:15.320]   You tried.
[00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:17.640]   I will be blogging after this.
[00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:19.440]   What's the big story you're covering?
[00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:24.280]   Dogpatch Labs is getting a new home.
[00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:24.960]   I don't know what that means.
[00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:26.400]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:30.600]   I'm not O'Korro with the hipster community in San Francisco,
[00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:31.160]   so I don't know.
[00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:33.480]   It was one of the companies that got kicked out
[00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:34.720]   of the Pier 38.
[00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:35.360]   Oh, yeah, yeah.
[00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:37.000]   When they condemned the Pier.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:37.520]   Mm-hmm.
[00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:38.880]   So they're going to Palo Alto.
[00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:40.680]   Congrats, San Francisco.
[00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:41.480]   You made the book--
[00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:42.600]   Yeah, you threw them out.
[00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:42.760]   There you go.
[00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:43.760]   What do these dogpatch Labs do?
[00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:44.920]   What do they make?
[00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:46.360]   They're a--
[00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:46.840]   They're like--
[00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:47.360]   Incubator.
[00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:48.520]   Well, they're not really an incubator.
[00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:51.040]   They're like an office space set up by Polaris Ventures.
[00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:51.560]   OK.
[00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:52.160]   I think they had over--
[00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:53.640]   So if you're a startup, you'd go in there,
[00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:55.280]   you'd hang out, you'd meet Kevin Rose,
[00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:57.760]   you'd have a cup of coffee, and then you'd go out inspired.
[00:23:57.760 --> 00:23:58.520]   Or you'd work.
[00:23:58.520 --> 00:23:59.520]   Or you'd work.
[00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:01.560]   No, nobody works at Silicon Valley.
[00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:02.680]   Roger Chang is also here.
[00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:06.280]   He works hard keeping Patrick Norton in line--
[00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:06.720]   Yes.
[00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:07.480]   --on Techzilla.
[00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:09.320]   Fortunately, he has jury duty next week,
[00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:11.160]   so I have Veronica and Robert all week.
[00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:11.920]   Oh, have fun.
[00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:12.280]   Yeah.
[00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:14.440]   And of course, East meets West.
[00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:15.240]   You still do that.
[00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:16.160]   You don't do it on Twitter anymore,
[00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:19.240]   because you guys decided you didn't want cameras.
[00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:21.320]   That, and it was just easier to fit into our schedules,
[00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:22.720]   because as they get--
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:23.240]   That's right.
[00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:23.600]   --was a question--
[00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:25.480]   We always put you wrong right after Twitter,
[00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:27.320]   and it was just kind of a pain in the ass.
[00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:27.840]   But it's great.
[00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:30.360]   And we tend to argue about a whole bunch of stuff.
[00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:31.600]   I love that show.
[00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:32.800]   It's a show about nothing.
[00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:34.160]   It's about everything.
[00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:35.840]   Actually, starting-- it's good we moved you,
[00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:38.840]   because starting in about a month, right after this show,
[00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:41.000]   we're going to have our gaming show, which I hope you'll--
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.080]   Now, here's the deal on that.
[00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:43.000]   We've got two great hosts.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.120]   I can't tell you who they are, because they haven't announced it yet.
[00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:47.040]   But once they announce it, we'll tell you.
[00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:49.200]   We're going to do-- it's going to be like kind of Sports Center.
[00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:51.200]   We haven't picked a name for it, but we're going to do that.
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:52.600]   And then afterwards, we're going to have a LAN party,
[00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:53.480]   like we used to on the screen.
[00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:54.160]   So sweet.
[00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:56.120]   And I'd love-- like when you come up to do Twitch,
[00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:56.640]   stick around.
[00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:58.520]   I'll take you to dinner, and we'll go play in the LAN party.
[00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:00.280]   You know what we're going to call the LAN party?
[00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:02.320]   Shut up and play.
[00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:03.000]   What do you think?
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.040]   I like the shut up part.
[00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:06.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:08.280]   Shut up and play.
[00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:11.840]   And also here-- and it's really good to have you, Tim.
[00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:14.560]   Tim Stevens, who is the editor-in-chief of Engadget.
[00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:17.560]   You took Joshua's place.
[00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:18.080]   I did indeed.
[00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:19.040]   Yes, back in April.
[00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:21.960]   So you and Alexia work for Ariana?
[00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:22.480]   Yes, we do.
[00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:23.000]   We do.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.800]   How's the new job treating you?
[00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:25.880]   You liking it?
[00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:26.400]   Fantastic.
[00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:27.280]   I love it.
[00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:28.440]   I'll give you an idea.
[00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:31.240]   He's about 300 miles away right now.
[00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:34.120]   Do you talk to Ariana a lot?
[00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:37.400]   No, I probably have maybe four or five meetings, I think,
[00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:39.280]   with her total since I started.
[00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:41.400]   So no, don't have a lot of interaction with her at all.
[00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:44.440]   Tim Darling, what I'd really like and gadget to cover,
[00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:48.160]   there's some really great gadgets in the field of purses
[00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:49.640]   and purse alarms.
[00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:51.400]   I'd like to do more of that, Tim, if you would.
[00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:51.760]   I'm a real guy.
[00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:52.480]   She was German.
[00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:53.280]   I don't know what she is.
[00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:53.840]   She's Greek.
[00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:54.320]   She's a Greek.
[00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:56.000]   Ariana Stasson, Opolis Huffington.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.320]   But probably did not have a shaved head when she was 17.
[00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:00.440]   Oh, I don't be surprised.
[00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:02.560]   The last time I had a head interaction with her actually,
[00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:05.320]   she wanted to get the new blackberry down in a 100 bold,
[00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:07.200]   but she wasn't sure if she was able to get it
[00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:08.280]   on her network.
[00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:09.880]   So we helped her out a little bit.
[00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:10.960]   I hope you talked her out of it.
[00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:12.640]   Yeah, I hope you talked her into an iPhone.
[00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:13.160]   I know.
[00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:14.480]   No, neither have phones.
[00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:15.560]   Addicted to blackberry.
[00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:17.520]   She's definitely on the crackberry.
[00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:19.440]   So she loved the phone and we were
[00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:21.840]   able to help her get it on A-Walls network.
[00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:22.400]   Wow.
[00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:24.000]   It's nice to have some geeks in the building.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:25.440]   Thank you for being here.
[00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:26.120]   We appreciate it.
[00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:27.280]   It's so cool, yeah.
[00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:29.160]   So if we're going to take a break, before we do,
[00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:30.560]   let's see what Mr. Tom Merritt.
[00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:31.680]   I'm going to throw you, Eileen.
[00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:33.440]   I'm going to give you a chance now.
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:36.440]   I'm going to talk really slowly so Tom can rush over
[00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:38.760]   to his chair and sit down.
[00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:41.040]   Tom Merritt, as you know, is the host of Tech News Today.
[00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:42.440]   Was he here this week?
[00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:43.680]   Did he record a week ahead?
[00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:45.480]   He recorded something, I believe.
[00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:46.320]   OK.
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:47.560]   So here we go, Tom Merritt.
[00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:49.960]   What's ahead this week?
[00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:50.880]   Hey, thanks, Leo.
[00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:51.960]   Here's a look at some of the stories
[00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:54.560]   we'll be keeping track of in the week ahead on Tech News
[00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:55.040]   today.

[00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:00.080]   Yay.

[00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:08.440]   with all the quickster controversy.
[00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:10.400]   Also, the Steve Jobs biography.
[00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:13.440]   That's the official biography by Walter Isaacson comes out.

[00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:18.640]   So expect a lot of people to call in sick that day.
[00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:19.960]   Wednesday, October 26th.
[00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:21.680]   Nokia World kicks off in London.
[00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:23.800]   We should hear about the Windows phones from Nokia
[00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:24.600]   at that time.
[00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:28.040]   Also, Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 coming to T-Mobile.
[00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:29.480]   Still don't know the price on that one.
[00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:30.640]   Thursday, October 27th.
[00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:33.480]   Motorola Droid RASER pre-orders begin.

[00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:41.400]   That's a look at what we'll be looking at in the week ahead.
[00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:42.200]   Back to you, Leo.
[00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:45.200]   Tech News, today, 2.30 PM Pacific 5.30 Eastern Monday
[00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:45.960]   through Friday.
[00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:47.640]   Of course, if you can't catch it live,
[00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:50.040]   you can-- with IAS Actar and Sarah Lane and Tom
[00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:54.200]   are you can always download it from twit.tv.
[00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:55.880]   Audio is almost immediately available.
[00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:57.480]   Video takes a little longer.
[00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:59.000]   You know how that is.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:27:59.680]   Definitely.
[00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:01.520]   Video, you got to squinch it and crunch it
[00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:02.840]   and do all sorts of stuff.
[00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:04.880]   Hey, before we go on, I'd like to mention our friends
[00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:06.440]   at Citrix.
[00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:08.160]   They do, of course, and we've talked about it many times
[00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:10.160]   before, the great go-to-meeting program.
[00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:12.400]   That's the program that lets you do online meetings.
[00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:13.960]   And they have a big announcement.
[00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:18.440]   Go to meeting now is available on iPhones and Android phones.
[00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:20.520]   So that means you-- now you have to hold the meeting
[00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:22.080]   on a Mac or a PC.
[00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:26.240]   But your attendees can be using iPads, iPhones, Android
[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:29.720]   devices, tablets, and phones to attend that meeting.
[00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:32.000]   They could be in the men's room.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.680]   Or the women's-- they could be anywhere.
[00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:36.200]   They could be on a train, on a plane, on a bus.
[00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:38.400]   As long as they can get online, here's what you do.
[00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:40.240]   Go to go-to-meeting.com.
[00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:42.320]   Click the Try It free button.

[00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:54.400]   Go to meetings.
[00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:55.160]   Fantastic.
[00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:58.880]   The new HD Faces app is so cool.
[00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:00.920]   They've added video to go to meetings.
[00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:03.200]   So of course, it's always had screen sharing.
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:06.840]   But now it's also got a video built into it.
[00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:07.680]   Now, I don't know.
[00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:08.920]   I haven't tried-- I'll have to try this.
[00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:11.760]   I think you have to have a PC or a Mac to do the video.
[00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:13.520]   I don't think you can use the-- you do?
[00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:14.120]   Yeah.
[00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:16.800]   So you can't use the phone or the tablet.
[00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:18.400]   Maybe you can use the tablet for the video.
[00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:19.640]   I think it's PC or Mac.
[00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:21.200]   But it really is great quality video.
[00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:23.720]   And of course, you see the video on the portable device.
[00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:24.400]   Go to meeting.
[00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:26.160]   It's a great way to do online meetings.
[00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:27.880]   It's all we use here.
[00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:31.400]   Wherever you are, you can attend meetings
[00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:32.640]   on your portable device.
[00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:38.440]   iPhone, iPad, and yes now, Android, and tablets too.
[00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:39.920]   Go to meeting.com.
[00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:40.880]   Click the try free button.
[00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:41.960]   Use the offer code TWIT.
[00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:42.920]   You're going to love it.
[00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:44.240]   Good video on that.
[00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:47.080]   By the way, really good video on that.
[00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:47.560]   All right.
[00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:50.040]   Let's move-- are we done with Steve Jobs?
[00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:50.880]   We'll be back.
[00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:51.480]   What's your fate?
[00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:52.960]   Yeah, we'll be back.
[00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:55.440]   Anybody-- you've got a favorite anecdote or quote
[00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:57.920]   from this book that we haven't mentioned yet.
[00:29:57.920 --> 00:29:58.760]   There's so many of them.
[00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:00.320]   I love when he tells Bill Clinton
[00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:02.800]   to tell the country about Monica Lewinsky.
[00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:03.440]   He said that?
[00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:05.560]   Yeah, he said you have to tell the truth.
[00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:06.480]   I don't know if you did or not.
[00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:09.320]   This from the guy who denied that he fathered a girl
[00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:12.080]   at a wedlock for a decade.
[00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:14.960]   He wouldn't-- he said-- in fact, he even told the world--
[00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:15.920]   maybe that's where he's coming from.
[00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:16.800]   He has some experience.
[00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:17.840]   He said, no, I'm sterile.
[00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:18.880]   I couldn't have fathered her.
[00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:21.360]   And shortly after that, he had three children.
[00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:23.160]   So great, Steve.
[00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:24.680]   You should tell the world about Monica.
[00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:26.400]   This was much later, too, right?
[00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:27.480]   This wasn't even--
[00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:30.240]   No, I think this was during a late night phone call.
[00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:33.600]   During the trial, Steve told Bill, you have to tell him--
[00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:34.160]   He's coming.
[00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:35.640]   It's almost Nixonian.
[00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:36.160]   He's like--
[00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:36.720]   He's like a hypocrite.
[00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:38.600]   It should be called Steve Jobs Hypocrites.
[00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:40.960]   So does he have just like a White House line or had a white--
[00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:41.440]   Apparently.
[00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:42.520]   He had a pipeline.
[00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:43.280]   That's kind of cool.
[00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:44.080]   It's a good tip for Tino.
[00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:45.320]   It's like you have to finish dinner.
[00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:46.440]   Maybe Clint Mcall Bill Clinton.
[00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:46.960]   It's amazing.
[00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:49.920]   Maybe Clint was calling for tech support.
[00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:50.760]   By the way, should--
[00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:51.480]   By the way.
[00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:53.120]   Yeah.
[00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:54.560]   Bill.
[00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:55.240]   I'm sorry.
[00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:56.160]   I was going to do a Bill Clinton.
[00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:57.440]   It's good.
[00:30:57.440 --> 00:31:00.640]   Steve, I can't figure out how to use this phone.
[00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:02.280]   I want to call Monica.
[00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:04.000]   Yeah, you should just tell everybody about Monica.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:04.480]   No, Steve.
[00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:05.560]   I just want to use the phone.
[00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:08.560]   No, you should just tell everybody about Monica.
[00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:09.840]   But I just want to use the phone.
[00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:11.280]   I did not have--
[00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:13.120]   Use the phone to tell everybody about Monica.
[00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:15.280]   I did not have 3G with this phone.
[00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:18.560]   I did not have 3G on this phone.
[00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:19.920]   Yeah, they barbecue.
[00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:22.120]   Apple posts-- and we might as well say this
[00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:23.120]   to kind of fill it out.
[00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:29.920]   Apple posts, it's earnings, $6.62 billion profit, $28.27 billion
[00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:34.280]   in revenue, $11 million iPad sold, $17 million iPhone sold
[00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:36.960]   and Wall Street was disappointed.
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:39.200]   I think people are disappointed in Wall Street.
[00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:40.800]   I guess what happened was they thought they'd
[00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:41.960]   be selling more iPhones.
[00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:44.600]   But there was a slowdown as people got ready for the next
[00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:45.800]   generation.
[00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:46.520]   So big deal.
[00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:49.040]   They sold 4 million iPhone 4s as in a weekend.
[00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:51.280]   I mean, Apple's internal projections
[00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:55.520]   were-- their guidance was $25 billion in revenue.
[00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:58.880]   And Wall Street's expectations was like $29 or something.
[00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:00.160]   And they got $28.
[00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:00.720]   They got $28.
[00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:02.160]   It's a Wall Street's disappointed.
[00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:06.480]   Wall Street's-- we should have expectations for Wall Street
[00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:07.680]   and be disappointed.
[00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:08.480]   I know.
[00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:10.400]   I'm disappointed with Wall Street.
[00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:12.280]   Well, look at the iPad story.
[00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:14.520]   40 million units total sold.
[00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:15.280]   Oh, that's right.
[00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:18.720]   How many-- how many have-- how many Zoom sold?
[00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:19.040]   Right.
[00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:22.000]   How many Galaxy tabs sold?
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.480]   Actually probably that they sold more--
[00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:26.840]   HP probably sold more touchpads than some of the other
[00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:28.720]   competitors, but no one.
[00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:29.760]   No one's even close.
[00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:32.320]   I mean, it feels a little bit right now like it's game over.
[00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:35.320]   And those numbers, you just can't ignore them.
[00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:36.800]   Yeah.
[00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:40.200]   You know, today is the 10th anniversary of the iPod.
[00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:42.600]   Just kind of amazing.
[00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:43.560]   I remember very well.
[00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:45.400]   You remember-- you guys might be too young.
[00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:47.480]   Lance, I know you would remember.
[00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:49.000]   2001, September 2001.
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:52.560]   Did you go down to a co-partino to see the iPod launch?
[00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:54.440]   I did not at the time.
[00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:56.200]   You know, it's right before that--
[00:32:56.200 --> 00:33:00.160]   I remember the two years before that where the whole industry
[00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:02.400]   was trying to figure out MP3 players.
[00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:04.800]   You know, we had a bunch of software-based stuff.
[00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:06.880]   Everybody was downloading software.
[00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:09.000]   And you know, there were things like something called
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:10.440]   the Jukebox out.
[00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:12.120]   You know, various companies going in there.
[00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:13.440]   And it was all just failures.
[00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:14.440]   And--
[00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:16.360]   I had a diamond Rio.
[00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:16.880]   Oh, yes.
[00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:18.320]   That was my first MP3 player.
[00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:19.640]   Well before the iPod.
[00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:20.640]   Yeah.
[00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:21.840]   Actually, a lot of people had those.
[00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:23.240]   They were fairly popular.
[00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:25.560]   But nobody had the right software to go with it.
[00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:26.720]   And no one really--
[00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:28.520]   you know, it's funny because a lot of times with Apple,
[00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:31.520]   you don't know what you need until Apple tells you.
[00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:35.000]   And no one really understood that if you made this sort
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   of ecosystem, if you created the software and the hardware
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:41.400]   almost together, that was going to propel it forward.
[00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:43.760]   Because you know, it made it super simple for people
[00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:44.640]   to find the music.
[00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:46.520]   And don't forget those deals that he made.
[00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:48.440]   You know, the fact that he got the music industry
[00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:50.320]   to work with them, and they were terrified back then.
[00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:52.040]   They didn't know what the hell was going on.
[00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:53.200]   He got them to work with them.
[00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:54.960]   If he hadn't done that, it would not
[00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:56.760]   have been the success that it turned out to be.
[00:33:56.760 --> 00:33:58.760]   But still, he created--
[00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:00.880]   they ended up creating that industry, which
[00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:02.360]   couldn't seem to figure out--
[00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:06.720]   it's asked from its elbow from 1999 to 2001.
[00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:08.960]   Very similar to the smartphone situation,
[00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:10.320]   where you had a lot of smartphones.
[00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:12.280]   But nobody loved their smartphone.
[00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:14.360]   And then Apple comes along and really changes it.
[00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:16.480]   Mike Elgin wrote a great article in Cultimack
[00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:18.800]   how the iPod started five revolutions.
[00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:20.520]   I thought it was fairly insightful.
[00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:24.160]   The one song revolution, it was used to have to buy albums.
[00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:26.520]   It was thanks to the iTunes and the iPod.
[00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:28.600]   You could buy a cut.
[00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:31.760]   Now, musicians hated that because they were selling whole
[00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:34.440]   albums just for the one good song.
[00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:36.000]   But it was great for consumers.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:42.160]   The online store, Device Revolution, he said--
[00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:44.200]   and Amazon's benefiting from this.
[00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:47.680]   The tablet is storefront.
[00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:50.760]   The App Store revolution, the iTunes concept,
[00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:52.880]   was re-envisioned by Apple as the App Store,
[00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:55.360]   the now standard model for buying software.
[00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:57.560]   The Touch Revolution, he points out the first iPod--
[00:34:57.560 --> 00:34:59.800]   you remember this-- had a rotating click wheel,
[00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:02.880]   but they very quickly went to one that didn't move.
[00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:04.640]   He says, when the mechanical wheel
[00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:07.920]   gave way to the capacitive sensing wheel,
[00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:13.040]   users got kind of conditioned to this idea of touch.
[00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:15.200]   Apple got excited about it and was eventually
[00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:19.160]   what inspired them to do the touch interface.
[00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:21.560]   And finally, the media appliance revolution,
[00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:24.840]   the idea of appliances specifically for media.
[00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:26.880]   And God knows, the TV would be one of those.
[00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:29.480]   Certainly, the iPad, the iPhone, the iPod.
[00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:31.480]   And yes, even the Zoom.
[00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:33.040]   So it's been an interesting 10 years.
[00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:35.240]   Really, the world has changed quite a bit, thanks
[00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:36.760]   to the iPod.
[00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:40.120]   Well, it was my second year of college when--
[00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:41.160]   which means I'm old--
[00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:42.080]   but when this thing--
[00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:45.560]   please, oh, I was working with you in 2000 or not.
[00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:46.040]   But I remember--
[00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:49.560]   No, do you remember Jim Latterback went down to Cupertino?
[00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:51.360]   And he brought back-- in fact, I still have it,
[00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:54.240]   the original-- could somebody get me that original--
[00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:57.160]   Chad, it's in my museum back there.
[00:35:57.160 --> 00:35:58.440]   I bring it out, everyone's swam.
[00:35:58.440 --> 00:35:59.720]   10 years old, he brought it back,
[00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:01.520]   said this was when Apple still liked me here.
[00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:04.120]   They wanted you to have this firewire charging.
[00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:05.160]   So you were in college--
[00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:05.680]   I was in college.
[00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:07.600]   Did you remember-- was this in Greece or was this in New York?
[00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:08.120]   No, this was here.
[00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:09.840]   This was in LA.
[00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:11.560]   And I remember it being so cool.
[00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:13.760]   But the iTunes store didn't launch,
[00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:15.680]   which is the real innovation here.
[00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:16.200]   Right.
[00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:18.480]   It didn't launch until 2003.
[00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:22.320]   So I feel like we were napsering a hell of a lot between two.
[00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:23.880]   Almost everything on here.
[00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:24.640]   It's from Napster.
[00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:25.480]   It's from Napster.
[00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:26.720]   I think we can still find music collection.
[00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:27.640]   I think it was a nice collection.
[00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:28.400]   It's from Napster.
[00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:29.840]   Look how thick it was.
[00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:31.760]   And remember it had firewire charging?
[00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:32.240]   It's so cute.
[00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:33.920]   And this was only five gigabytes, right?
[00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:37.480]   But the whole idea of this was it's your music collection
[00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:39.800]   in your pocket, 1,000 songs in your pocket.
[00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:41.040]   And this is the one that still had--
[00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:43.600]   this is a physical wheel that rotated.
[00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:46.120]   I remember it was green.
[00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:46.560]   That's it?
[00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:48.080]   That's 10 years old.
[00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:48.560]   Yeah.
[00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:54.360]   I thought the iTunes was first, then the iPod was second.
[00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:57.320]   They were together within the same year.
[00:36:57.320 --> 00:36:57.880]   I don't remember.
[00:36:57.880 --> 00:37:00.320]   I thought the iPod was first, and then the iTunes.
[00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:00.920]   I was really first.
[00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:01.400]   It was really first.
[00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:02.960]   And iTunes Store was 2003.
[00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:03.480]   OK.
[00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:04.440]   Oh, it was two years later.
[00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:05.080]   Two years later.
[00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:06.560]   Well, how did you get stuff on this thing?
[00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:07.000]   No, no.
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:07.600]   You used--
[00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:08.640]   Burn through these, right.
[00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:09.680]   Well, you didn't have an iTunes store,
[00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:12.080]   but you had iTunes-- the inner films that you used.
[00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:13.040]   Right, right, right, right.
[00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:13.400]   The inner films.
[00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:15.800]   You have to stuff into iTunes, and then you put it in.
[00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:18.800]   So the big thing was really ripping your CDs
[00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:23.040]   or music you already had from somewhere.
[00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:23.800]   Well, I mean--
[00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:27.760]   You know, the truth is really the revolution was Napster.
[00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:29.920]   Well, it was really when the revolution happened.
[00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:31.760]   That's when I got excited about music again.
[00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:35.800]   I downloaded 10 gigabytes of music for free.
[00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:37.520]   So Apple's original press release.
[00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:39.520]   Actually, Napster didn't buy something.
[00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:40.360]   June 9, 2001.
[00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:42.800]   June 9, 2001, Apple introduces iTunes.
[00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:44.320]   And what they called it-- this was funny,
[00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:46.400]   because this was something I'd read when I was doing some
[00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:46.840]   research.
[00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:48.840]   They called it the world's best and easiest
[00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:51.120]   to use Jukebox software.
[00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:53.120]   So that was January 9, 2001.
[00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:54.360]   They bought a company.
[00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:55.720]   That's where it came from.
[00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:56.880]   That's right.
[00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:57.520]   That's right.
[00:37:57.520 --> 00:38:01.320]   And then that following year, I believe the September of that
[00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:03.720]   year is when the first iPod came out.
[00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:06.520]   But could you buy music on iTunes?
[00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:07.240]   I don't--
[00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:09.120]   I think they didn't have a store yet.
[00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:10.040]   That's what the confusion--
[00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:10.520]   I don't think they had--
[00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:10.520]   --they had--
[00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:11.760]   --like music through iTunes.
[00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:12.960]   It was about importing music--
[00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:14.800]   It was about importing music--
[00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:15.240]   Right.
[00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:16.160]   --into basically--
[00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:16.760]   Yeah, ripping season.
[00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:18.160]   --ripping songs.
[00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:19.160]   Right, right, right.
[00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:20.880]   So that was primarily it.
[00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:24.680]   But then the second piece of it with the iPod and music
[00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:27.880]   deals, that came, I believe, later in the year.
[00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:33.960]   So the program-- and Jeff Robin I've talked to since then--
[00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:36.720]   the program that they bought was released by Cassidy
[00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:38.320]   and Green 10 years before that.
[00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:40.000]   In 1990, it was called Soundjam.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:41.240]   Remember that?
[00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:43.120]   And that was the basis.
[00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:45.400]   Apple purchased it in 2000, the basis for iTunes.
[00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:45.880]   But you're right.
[00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:48.040]   It didn't have a store in it yet.
[00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:49.440]   Right.
[00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:51.400]   I feel like a bunch of old guys talking
[00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:53.640]   about when the first automatic transmission came out.
[00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:54.160]   Yeah.
[00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:58.920]   Well, it's like that video that Lance posted on earlier
[00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:02.080]   this week of the baby swiping the magazine pages,
[00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:04.040]   hoping that something--
[00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:06.080]   --clumping that something would change.
[00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:07.520]   And that's how our kids are going to be.
[00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:09.200]   Our kids are going to look at this and be like,
[00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:11.120]   why isn't it invisible?
[00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:12.120]   Right.
[00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:13.120]   What is it invisible?
[00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:14.240]   There is that great story.
[00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:16.240]   There's a great story of Steve Jobs.
[00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:18.040]   This is also from the book.
[00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:20.480]   And the first prototype for the iPod--
[00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:21.560]   and they brought it to them.
[00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:24.280]   I'm sure those meetings are very tense, Mr. Jobs.
[00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:28.880]   Here's what we think you'll want to release as the iPod.
[00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:29.360]   And he looks at it.
[00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:30.440]   He says, it's too big.
[00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:33.960]   They said, we can't make it any smaller.
[00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:36.760]   And he takes this prototype.
[00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:38.240]   There's probably only one of them, right?
[00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:40.440]   Throws it in a fish tank.
[00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:41.360]   It sinks to the bottle.
[00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:42.160]   Bubbles rise out.
[00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:43.840]   He says, there's air in there.
[00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:44.280]   See?
[00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:45.720]   Get rid of it.
[00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:47.320]   Make it smaller.
[00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:49.600]   So wow.
[00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:52.160]   There's no air in there, apparently.
[00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:53.320]   All right, let's move on.
[00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:54.600]   We talked enough about Apple.
[00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:55.680]   Let's talk about Andrew.
[00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:56.600]   Well, what's that?
[00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:57.720]   Is this the next generation?
[00:39:57.720 --> 00:39:59.160]   We've got all the generations here.
[00:39:59.160 --> 00:39:59.560]   Look at this.
[00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:00.520]   Holy cow.
[00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:01.920]   Man, we--
[00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:03.680]   We got us addicted to this.
[00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:04.720]   All the corners.
[00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:05.560]   These are all mine.
[00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:06.640]   This is when the addictions--
[00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:07.160]   No, no.
[00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:08.040]   And then remember--
[00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:08.540]   Watch.
[00:40:08.540 --> 00:40:09.240]   Now look at these.
[00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:10.200]   Look how nice these are.
[00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:11.680]   This is the first nano, remember?
[00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:13.200]   Then look at this.
[00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:15.320]   Dell's response.
[00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:15.840]   Yeah.
[00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:16.340]   Oh, no.
[00:40:16.340 --> 00:40:17.960]   That was Dell's second response, right?
[00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:19.240]   I'd purchase Dell's first response.
[00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:20.400]   That's right.
[00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:22.200]   Shut Apple down and sell the stock.
[00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:23.000]   And that's lovely.
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:24.240]   Can you charge that up?
[00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:27.000]   That was about the time that Michael Dell said that.
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:27.480]   He said--
[00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:28.880]   He said it in '97.
[00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:29.320]   Yeah.
[00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:30.400]   He said it '97.
[00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:31.000]   Oh, that's right.
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   And he was right in '97.
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.680]   Apple was days away from bankruptcy at that time, actually.
[00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:37.480]   This looks a lot like the diamond Rio did.
[00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:39.680]   Somewhere I have a diamond Rio in my collection as well.
[00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:40.240]   Yeah.
[00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:41.000]   Look at that.
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:41.520]   Interesting.
[00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:42.520]   Those are fun.
[00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:44.680]   All right, let's talk about-- there was a big announcement.
[00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:46.200]   Was it this week?
[00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:47.280]   Home hard to believe.
[00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:48.080]   It was.
[00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:48.600]   Amazing.
[00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:51.440]   You were in Hong Kong, Tim, for this.
[00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:53.680]   Yeah, I flew out Monday morning to Hong Kong
[00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:55.280]   and got back Thursday afternoon.
[00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:57.280]   So yeah, it's been a long week.
[00:40:57.280 --> 00:40:59.280]   It must be exhausted.
[00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:00.280]   Yeah.
[00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:01.560]   This was the deferred announcement.
[00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:05.200]   Samsung and Google were going to make this announcement earlier,
[00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:07.720]   but decided that because of Steve Jobs' death,
[00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:11.520]   they didn't want to announce the new ice cream sandwich
[00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:15.040]   Android 4.0 operating system and the first phone
[00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:18.160]   to carry it, which is the Samsung Galaxy Nexus.
[00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:19.960]   So you spent about an hour with the Nexus.
[00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:21.520]   Tell us about it.
[00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:23.880]   Yeah.
[00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:26.800]   Early as a side shot they had in that teaser picture
[00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:28.520]   where they said something big is coming,
[00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:30.560]   the screen was so curved it almost looked like a banana,
[00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:32.160]   but the actual device out there--
[00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:33.160]   No, really?
[00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:33.680]   Not that curved.
[00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:34.160]   Yes.
[00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:35.720]   It's that curved?
[00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:37.000]   It's not that curved, actually.
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   I'm not sure what they did in the--
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:40.880]   Did the curve towards the right or the left?
[00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:42.480]   It's all about how it dresses, I believe.
[00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:43.720]   Straight and true.
[00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:45.320]   It dresses straight and true.
[00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:48.320]   It's no more curved than the Nexus S that came before,
[00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:51.200]   actually, but it's the same sort of experience there.
[00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:52.440]   It doesn't really feel that much different,
[00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:53.680]   but it is considerably thinner.
[00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:56.800]   It's about nine millimeters, which does shape quite a bit
[00:41:56.800 --> 00:42:00.760]   off of the Nexus S, certainly the Nexus 4G.
[00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:04.280]   A big talking point this week has been the nature of that display.
[00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:07.720]   It's got a 720p OLED display, which is great.
[00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:10.880]   But it's using the older Pentile pixel makeup,
[00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:13.560]   which means it's instead of RGB, it's RGBG,
[00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:15.680]   which basically means there are--
[00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:17.880]   Wait a minute, the BG's are in this?
[00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:20.200]   Yeah, yeah, pretty crazy, right?
[00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:23.640]   Basically, it means there's 50% more green pixels
[00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:25.080]   than any other color.
[00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:27.320]   So that means that the color of reproduction
[00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:30.520]   is going to be a little bit off on this.
[00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:33.200]   But it's not going to be as noticeable as it was.
[00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:35.560]   The original Galaxy S had a display like this.
[00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:36.960]   So did the Nexus 1, right?
[00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:39.720]   This was the Pentile display and the Nexus 1 as well.
[00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:41.520]   And I didn't think that was a bad display.
[00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:42.040]   It's a plus.
[00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:42.680]   I thought it was good.
[00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:44.560]   I did hear people complain about color cast,
[00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:47.400]   a green color cast in it, but I thought it was a good display.
[00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:50.200]   Now, the Galaxy S2 is stunning.
[00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:52.480]   It will not be as good as the S2.
[00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:55.760]   And the Galaxy S2 introduced the AMOLED Plus.
[00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:58.880]   And that's what got rid of this Pentile type of layout.
[00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:00.480]   So unfortunately, it's a bit of a step back
[00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:03.000]   in terms of the actual makeup of the display.
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:05.960]   But one of the problems with the Galaxy S
[00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:07.280]   was the resolution was so much lower.
[00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:09.600]   Since we're talking 720p, I don't think
[00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:11.480]   it's actually going to be that noticeable for people
[00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:13.480]   in terms of the quality of the image.
[00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:16.080]   But the color is definitely going to be a bit greenish, I think.
[00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:20.040]   This is really-- I mean, this is a 4.65 inch screen,
[00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:22.800]   1280 by 720.
[00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:25.840]   I mean, that's like a computer's monitor resolution.
[00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:28.560]   Yeah, it's full-- well, not full HD.
[00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:31.680]   It's technically 1080p, but it's a 720p image.
[00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:33.480]   So if you download an HD movie, you
[00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:35.720]   can watch it without losing any pixels,
[00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:37.400]   without any cropping, without any buying.
[00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:38.360]   So Tim, you saw it.
[00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:39.640]   I mean, what is your sense of it?
[00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:41.360]   I mean, you looked at it for an hour.
[00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:44.320]   Did it seem green, do you?
[00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:45.360]   It was a bit greenish.
[00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:47.360]   I mean, honestly, we were more focused on the hardware
[00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:49.440]   than the thinness of the performance of the camera.
[00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:51.360]   They were talking about a zero-shutter-like camera,
[00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:53.040]   which was actually very impressive as well.
[00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:54.520]   The speed of the camera.
[00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:54.840]   Yes.
[00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:55.880]   The speed of the camera.
[00:43:55.880 --> 00:43:56.480]   It's unbelievable.
[00:43:56.480 --> 00:43:57.480]   Wow.
[00:43:57.480 --> 00:43:58.480]   I mean, I thought the iPhone 4S--
[00:43:58.480 --> 00:43:59.360]   You did it back.
[00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:00.360]   --yeah, I saw that video.
[00:44:00.360 --> 00:44:01.280]   You did it back test.
[00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:01.640]   Yeah.
[00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:05.480]   The 4S in the Net Goxie Nexus is slightly quicker.
[00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:07.720]   I mean, at this point, it was kind of splitting here.
[00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:09.160]   The 4S is very quick.
[00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:11.920]   Goxie Nexus is slightly quicker, but it's much, much quicker
[00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:14.320]   than just about any other Android device.
[00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:15.840]   I mean, the Bionic just launched.
[00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:17.600]   And that is one of the slowest I take.
[00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:20.280]   Bionic is like three seconds between pictures.
[00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:21.840]   It's unbelievably bad.
[00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:23.400]   As quickly as you can tap the screen,
[00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:24.400]   it'll take pictures.
[00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:26.000]   That's quite an improvement.
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:29.480]   Well, and I think that this is important if we believe,
[00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:32.440]   and I think we do, that these phones are going to replace point
[00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:33.160]   and shoot cameras.
[00:44:33.160 --> 00:44:33.920]   Yes.
[00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:35.480]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:36.960]   But we have quite a few questions.
[00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:39.400]   I mean, one thing is the software was very buggy.
[00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:41.920]   We saw at least four different builds of ice cream sandwich
[00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:43.760]   running on different devices, some of which
[00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:45.160]   were in different--
[00:44:45.160 --> 00:44:46.920]   let's say, so disarray, some were crashing,
[00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:50.240]   some were not doing the Google Beam functionality,
[00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:52.480]   which lets you exchange things wirelessly.
[00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:53.440]   That's weak.
[00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:54.800]   Nobody's going to do that.
[00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:57.200]   Yeah, I'm a little bit leery about that, too.
[00:44:57.200 --> 00:44:59.640]   I mean, HP made a big deal about that with the touchpad
[00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:00.400]   and the pre-3.
[00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:01.880]   And at that point, we didn't think it was going to be
[00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:03.280]   anything big, because how many people
[00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:05.360]   were going to buy touchpads and pre-3s.
[00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:07.480]   Now, of course, you'll have much more Android devices
[00:45:07.480 --> 00:45:09.800]   around, and you can, in theory, use it more commonly.
[00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:12.040]   But even then, I just don't see walking up to somebody
[00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:13.840]   and saying, hey, check out this web page, Donk.
[00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:16.720]   Don't you have to have an NSC chip in there for that to work?
[00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:17.720]   You do.
[00:45:17.720 --> 00:45:21.280]   So there's only two phones you can do that with.
[00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:22.160]   Very few phones.
[00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:24.240]   There are a few others that have NSC built in,
[00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:29.760]   but the T-Mobile Galaxy S2 has NSC as well.
[00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:30.440]   Right, that's it.
[00:45:30.440 --> 00:45:32.120]   It's getting to be more common.
[00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:34.200]   But certainly, right now, it's a rarity.
[00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:37.760]   But I think Google's going to make Google a big push there.
[00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:39.600]   So I think we'll be seeing that in quite a few more
[00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:42.440]   devices going forward.
[00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:43.240]   I do like the thin.
[00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:45.720]   And I think that that's one advantage that right now, Android,
[00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:48.640]   especially Samsung, has over the iPhone, the iPhone,
[00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:52.080]   as slick and beautiful as it is, is thicker and heavier.
[00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:54.440]   Yeah, Android is definitely--
[00:45:54.440 --> 00:45:57.040]   Android devices, they're making some interesting pushes
[00:45:57.040 --> 00:45:59.920]   for bigger screens and thinner devices, which I think a lot
[00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:00.800]   of people want.
[00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:02.440]   That was one of the biggest disappointments
[00:46:02.440 --> 00:46:05.080]   that a lot of people had when all the we got was the 4S
[00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:05.680]   from Apple.
[00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:08.280]   A lot of people wanted a bigger screen and a thinner device.
[00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:09.240]   But they want Android.
[00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:10.560]   It's offering that.
[00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:11.680]   Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:13.360]   I mean, I don't think anybody's going to be jumping
[00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:14.760]   shipped from one cam to the other.
[00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:17.560]   But there's definitely a lot of disappointments there.
[00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:20.320]   So Samsung's giving you a bigger screen for sure.
[00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:21.600]   But it is a very big screen.
[00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:23.560]   I mean, 4.7 inches just about.
[00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:25.000]   That's a big display.
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:28.360]   There's not a lot of bezel, but it's still a big device.
[00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:28.920]   The other thing that--
[00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:29.280]   Yeah.
[00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:30.160]   --feels like a big device?
[00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:33.760]   That's what I was wondering, like how it feels in your hand.
[00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:35.000]   Because that's a lot.
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:38.080]   It feels actually smaller than the current
[00:46:38.080 --> 00:46:40.680]   the Nexus S, because it's a bit thinner.
[00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:43.200]   But it is still a wide device.
[00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:46.200]   So it depends on the size of your pockets and your skinny
[00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:48.000]   jeans, whether or not it's going to be comfortable.
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:49.640]   But I mean, I've got pretty big hands,
[00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:50.640]   so it feels good for me.
[00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:52.800]   But if you've got smaller hands, I can definitely
[00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:55.800]   see this as being a little bit too big.
[00:46:55.800 --> 00:47:00.480]   You know, the Joy-Razer came out last week as well.
[00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:03.280]   And that's actually a thinner 7.1 millimeter.
[00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:03.720]   12 hours before.
[00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:04.520]   Geez, Louise.
[00:47:04.520 --> 00:47:05.840]   Right, 7.1 millimeters.
[00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:08.640]   And actually, they used a different kind of construction.
[00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:12.040]   So it's one of the lightest smartphones,
[00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:15.960]   like 4.1 inches smartphones I've ever felt.
[00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:17.840]   It almost felt-- and I didn't--
[00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:21.280]   I kind of hesitated to say this, but it was so light,
[00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:23.240]   the way it felt was slightly toy-like.
[00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:24.480]   It didn't feel like--
[00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:25.960]   There's something about a device when
[00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:27.440]   you hold it, these smartphones, that you
[00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:29.720]   want to feel a tiny bit of heft.
[00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:30.760]   You actually don't feel that.
[00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:31.800]   It's got a Kevlar back.
[00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:33.920]   It's got sort of this aluminum body on.
[00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:36.160]   It's very, very different.
[00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:38.360]   But wow, talk about thin.
[00:47:38.360 --> 00:47:41.280]   The thing I'm-- well, there's a psychological effect.
[00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:44.160]   When you have a big screen, if it's thin and light,
[00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:46.240]   it kind of doesn't feel like a big phone.
[00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:48.680]   It just kind of just-- even with a big screen.
[00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:51.280]   But the thing I'm most interested in is pixels per inch.
[00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:56.560]   Is this going to be the resolution of the iPhone 4,
[00:47:56.560 --> 00:47:58.680]   which is this incredible resolution?
[00:47:58.680 --> 00:48:02.760]   This is from Anand Tech, pixel density comparison
[00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:03.840]   effective pixels per inch.
[00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:07.080]   And it looks like it's very close to the iPhone 4.
[00:48:07.080 --> 00:48:10.200]   It comes in just a bit lower, but it's still above that 300
[00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:13.120]   mark, which is supposedly the magic number for the ability
[00:48:13.120 --> 00:48:16.360]   for the human retina to recognize individual pixels.
[00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:19.120]   So we've crossed that 300 threshold, which
[00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:21.480]   means that to the naked eye, you shouldn't
[00:48:21.480 --> 00:48:23.400]   be able to tell the difference between this one
[00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:25.960]   and the iPhone 4/4s.
[00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:26.600]   Pretty impressive.
[00:48:26.600 --> 00:48:28.000]   Subconsciously, you know, though.
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:29.000]   You know.
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:30.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   You'll know when you don't have an apple.
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:32.480]   The 15 or so pixels are cheating.
[00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:33.360]   I can tell.
[00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:35.440]   Now, when you get to sub pixels,
[00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:38.080]   and this is why Pentile, it's apples and oranges
[00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:39.160]   a little bit.
[00:48:39.160 --> 00:48:42.160]   When you get to sub pixels, it's actually not
[00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:46.840]   as-- it's in a different status here.
[00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:49.280]   However, I think it still doesn't look pretty good.
[00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:52.840]   So this is the difference between counting RGB
[00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:55.960]   as a complete pixel versus R versus G versus B.
[00:48:55.960 --> 00:48:58.760]   And that's where you get this different ratio between--
[00:48:58.760 --> 00:49:00.200]   you know, the different pixel density basis.
[00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:03.440]   And here, it's actually worse than the atrix and the droid.
[00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:03.720]   Right.
[00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:06.440]   That's actually stepping back to the old Galaxy S days
[00:49:06.440 --> 00:49:08.080]   when we had a much lower resolution.
[00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:09.960]   But I think in terms of effective resolution,
[00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:11.800]   I think it'll be a very clear picture for people.
[00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:14.440]   And I don't think people will notice that too much.
[00:49:14.440 --> 00:49:15.440]   Right.
[00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:16.440]   I hope anyway.
[00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:18.280]   So one of the biggest questions that I have, though,
[00:49:18.280 --> 00:49:19.800]   is battery life on this device.
[00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:22.200]   For the droid razor, they gave it an estimated talk time
[00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:25.280]   of, I think, it was 12 and 1/2 hours, which is quite impressive.
[00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:27.960]   Nobody was talking battery life for the Galaxy Nexus.
[00:49:27.960 --> 00:49:29.960]   And we're a bit concerned that it's not
[00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:32.360]   going to be that hot.
[00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:35.440]   It's got an LTE or HSPA+ built-in.
[00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:38.520]   We've seen HSPA+ devices with good battery life.
[00:49:38.520 --> 00:49:41.240]   But we haven't really seen any LTE devices with good battery
[00:49:41.240 --> 00:49:43.240]   life beyond the promised razor.
[00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:44.960]   So that's a big question on my mind,
[00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:46.800]   is what's the battery life in this thing could be like?
[00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:47.760]   Do you think we'll solve that?
[00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:50.600]   I mean, I remember 3G killed battery life early on.
[00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:51.440]   Yeah.
[00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:53.600]   We definitely will solve that when we see more devices
[00:49:53.600 --> 00:49:55.360]   with integrated LTE radios.
[00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:57.960]   Right now, they're all separated, which means you've got extra--
[00:49:57.960 --> 00:50:00.000]   something else sucking down the battery life.
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:02.920]   We think that's why the razors able to get improved battery
[00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:05.040]   life like that, because they finally integrated things.
[00:50:05.040 --> 00:50:07.920]   We won't know for sure until somebody tears it down
[00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:09.240]   and finds out.
[00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:11.880]   But that's what we think is going on inside the razors.
[00:50:11.880 --> 00:50:14.160]   Inside the Galaxy Nexus, we just don't know at this point.
[00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:17.840]   Are your readers reporting a bad battery life on the 4S?
[00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:20.160]   It seems like it's much lower than it was.
[00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:21.520]   If you Siri--
[00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:23.240]   If you Siri, is it Siri that's coming in?
[00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:23.680]   They definitely are.
[00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:26.960]   Or find my friends or a lot of these other things that
[00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:28.080]   keep the radios turned on.
[00:50:28.080 --> 00:50:28.840]   Is that what's going on?
[00:50:28.840 --> 00:50:30.640]   Yeah, quite a few of these things suck down data.
[00:50:30.640 --> 00:50:33.120]   But we're also having people report extra heat
[00:50:33.120 --> 00:50:35.040]   and lower battery life on their iPhone 4,
[00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:36.760]   essentially upgraded to iOS 5.
[00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:37.440]   Oh, iOS.
[00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:41.040]   It certainly could be iOS 5 more so than the device itself.
[00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:41.440]   OK.
[00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:43.240]   Doing more stuff in the background,
[00:50:43.240 --> 00:50:46.000]   doing all the things that Apple tried to avoid for a long time,
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:47.960]   because they knew it would eat into battery life.
[00:50:47.960 --> 00:50:49.840]   By the way, I was going to mention on the razor,
[00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:52.920]   when I sat down with the Motorola people at the event,
[00:50:52.920 --> 00:50:54.640]   I asked them about that battery life,
[00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:56.160]   because they were not clear.
[00:50:56.160 --> 00:51:00.160]   They never said that that was LTE 4G battery life.
[00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:02.040]   They basically just gave us numbers.
[00:51:02.040 --> 00:51:04.840]   So I sat at a table and I said, so the numbers,
[00:51:04.840 --> 00:51:06.640]   are they 3G or 4G?
[00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:09.840]   And one guy said 4G and one guy said 3G.
[00:51:09.840 --> 00:51:11.520]   And I looked at them, I said, which is right.
[00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:13.080]   And they both looked at each other.
[00:51:13.080 --> 00:51:16.840]   And then they just looked like deers caught in headlights.
[00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:18.240]   They didn't really respond.
[00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:20.680]   So finally, they pointed over at some other table.
[00:51:20.680 --> 00:51:24.600]   And what that says to me is that it's not.
[00:51:24.600 --> 00:51:27.480]   I'm telling you that every experience that I've had
[00:51:27.480 --> 00:51:30.920]   and that I've seen with 4G is it's a battery hog.
[00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:34.760]   And they gave best possible, best circumstance numbers,
[00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:37.560]   which is almost always going to be 3G.
[00:51:37.560 --> 00:51:42.000]   I solved it by putting a ginormous battery on my iPhone.
[00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:43.560]   Now it looks like an iPod now.
[00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:45.280]   Yeah, I mean, it's a look at that.
[00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:46.400]   It's kind of disgusting.
[00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:50.960]   And then I also carry a car phone, I mean, a car battery
[00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:53.640]   with me back here, so I'm always ready.
[00:51:53.640 --> 00:51:57.360]   Only 50 more pounds and I'm never without juice.
[00:51:57.360 --> 00:52:02.240]   I want to talk a little bit about C-Ray, the N9,
[00:52:02.240 --> 00:52:04.800]   with Windows Phone 7 on it.
[00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:06.600]   In fact, let's talk about Microsoft.
[00:52:06.600 --> 00:52:09.160]   In general, also Yahoo.
[00:52:09.160 --> 00:52:11.280]   Apparently Google-- oh, this seems hard to believe--
[00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:14.280]   might be mulling a bid for Yahoo.
[00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:15.960]   Antitrust is not going to let that go.
[00:52:15.960 --> 00:52:17.160]   There's no way, right?
[00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:19.640]   Well, Yahoo's not really in the search business anymore.
[00:52:19.640 --> 00:52:20.280]   Well, that's true.
[00:52:20.280 --> 00:52:21.440]   What they're doing is--
[00:52:21.440 --> 00:52:22.200]   We'll talk about that.
[00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:22.960]   And also--
[00:52:22.960 --> 00:52:24.120]   In the next five minutes?
[00:52:24.120 --> 00:52:24.920]   The Lightro.
[00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:25.840]   We've got five minutes.
[00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:27.000]   The Lightro camera.
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:28.040]   I don't want one.
[00:52:28.040 --> 00:52:28.880]   I don't want one.
[00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:30.400]   Yeah, try and stick it in your pocket.
[00:52:30.400 --> 00:52:31.560]   You and I will fight.
[00:52:31.560 --> 00:52:34.080]   It's like a kaleidoscope that's square.
[00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:35.160]   Just what I need.
[00:52:35.160 --> 00:52:36.840]   But we're going to talk about that.
[00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:38.000]   You and I, we can fight.
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:39.320]   We can battle.
[00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:41.120]   Roger, Chang, and I.
[00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:44.920]   We'll strip down to our thongs and fight it out
[00:52:44.920 --> 00:52:45.600]   over the Lightro.
[00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:46.120]   Just a minute.
[00:52:46.120 --> 00:52:47.280]   But first--
[00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:48.920]   I wear boxers.
[00:52:48.920 --> 00:52:52.360]   You don't wear thongs?
[00:52:52.360 --> 00:52:54.360]   Patrick told me you wore a thong.
[00:52:54.360 --> 00:52:55.640]   So let's talk.
[00:52:55.640 --> 00:52:56.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:52:56.920 --> 00:52:58.240]   Makes it very difficult.
[00:52:58.240 --> 00:53:00.080]   It does.
[00:53:00.080 --> 00:53:00.720]   Guys.
[00:53:00.720 --> 00:53:01.920]   Alexis, are you in chat?
[00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:02.920]   They want to chat with you.
[00:53:02.920 --> 00:53:02.920]   Alexia.
[00:53:02.920 --> 00:53:03.840]   No, I'm not--
[00:53:03.840 --> 00:53:05.560]   I'm not-- no, but I do want to leave.
[00:53:05.560 --> 00:53:06.840]   The thong-- the thong thing.
[00:53:06.840 --> 00:53:07.280]   That was it.
[00:53:07.280 --> 00:53:08.240]   The major nervous.
[00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:08.600]   Nothing.
[00:53:08.600 --> 00:53:11.400]   There's nothing like an image of like a--
[00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:12.280]   A guy in a thong.
[00:53:12.280 --> 00:53:15.080]   A tech guy in a thong, too.
[00:53:15.080 --> 00:53:16.840]   Well, why is it just a tech guy?
[00:53:16.840 --> 00:53:18.000]   Why can't it be--
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:19.080]   Roger pretty buff.
[00:53:19.080 --> 00:53:19.880]   Look at that.
[00:53:19.880 --> 00:53:21.200]   This guy's in good shape.
[00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:22.840]   Your girlfriend's in the audience.
[00:53:22.840 --> 00:53:23.340]   Hey.
[00:53:23.340 --> 00:53:25.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:53:25.600 --> 00:53:26.600]   Does he wear a thong?
[00:53:26.600 --> 00:53:27.440]   He can tell the truth.
[00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:28.720]   A tech guy in a thong.
[00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:29.840]   She says no.
[00:53:29.840 --> 00:53:31.560]   We were doing Steve Jobs.
[00:53:31.560 --> 00:53:33.520]   Boxers are briefs earlier.
[00:53:33.520 --> 00:53:34.920]   Oh, he's a brief guy, don't you think?
[00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:35.840]   No, boxers.
[00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:37.000]   Bill Gates briefs.
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:38.080]   Briefs.
[00:53:38.080 --> 00:53:39.080]   For sure.
[00:53:39.080 --> 00:53:42.240]   Bill Gates had some nasty things to say about jobs, too.
[00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:46.760]   He said you can't decide if he's trying to seduce you or screw you.
[00:53:46.760 --> 00:53:47.760]   Screw you.
[00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:49.680]   And you don't know which one you're going to get?
[00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:51.600]   You know, at some point, they all become the same.
[00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:52.640]   Yeah.
[00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:53.560]   Let's talk about Ford.
[00:53:53.560 --> 00:53:54.240]   Why don't we?
[00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:55.680]   My Mustang's parked out front.
[00:53:55.680 --> 00:53:56.520]   Do you like that?
[00:53:56.520 --> 00:53:58.160]   When everybody's talking about the Siri stuff,
[00:53:58.160 --> 00:53:59.680]   where you talk to your phone, I've
[00:53:59.680 --> 00:54:01.080]   been talking to my Ford for ages.
[00:54:01.080 --> 00:54:03.600]   I'd say set the cabin temperature 73 degrees.
[00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:05.480]   I'd say place a Bob Dylan music.
[00:54:05.480 --> 00:54:07.160]   I'd say where's the nearest gas station?
[00:54:07.160 --> 00:54:09.160]   I'd say is there traffic up ahead?
[00:54:09.160 --> 00:54:11.680]   And it responds to me, you can talk to your car
[00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:14.000]   with Ford's great sync technology.
[00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:15.960]   And you add the My Ford touch.
[00:54:15.960 --> 00:54:18.880]   And now you've got-- I mean, it's like it's so cool.
[00:54:18.880 --> 00:54:20.680]   You've got the big screen on the console.
[00:54:20.680 --> 00:54:22.560]   There are two behind the steering wheel.
[00:54:22.560 --> 00:54:23.000]   I love it.
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:23.840]   It's just little things.
[00:54:23.840 --> 00:54:25.560]   Like the beability-- I know you're in a car.
[00:54:25.560 --> 00:54:27.120]   The ability to set your cruise control.
[00:54:27.120 --> 00:54:28.400]   Normally, in the cruise control, you're
[00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:29.160]   going to a certain speed.
[00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:30.920]   You press the button and it says, OK, I'll remember that.
[00:54:30.920 --> 00:54:33.480]   On the My Ford touch, you tell it what speed.
[00:54:33.480 --> 00:54:35.480]   Say, I want to go 67 miles an hour.
[00:54:35.480 --> 00:54:37.840]   And it says-- it shows that it's so cool.
[00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:40.000]   It's little things like the fuel is filtered.
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:42.600]   And look at this, the newest thing in the Ford,
[00:54:42.600 --> 00:54:45.560]   they can turn your car into a Wi-Fi access spot.
[00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:48.840]   They've got Wi-Fi connectivity in the new 2012 Focus.
[00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:51.680]   All the new cars with the available sync in My Ford
[00:54:51.680 --> 00:54:53.120]   touch will have this.
[00:54:53.120 --> 00:54:57.320]   They have USB ports, two of them on the My Ford touch.
[00:54:57.320 --> 00:55:00.480]   One of them, you put the 3G thing in there, the 3G dongle
[00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:00.800]   in there.
[00:55:00.800 --> 00:55:02.920]   And now they've got antennas in the cabin.
[00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:04.040]   And you can get five people.
[00:55:04.040 --> 00:55:06.040]   It's a Wi-Fi access spot.
[00:55:06.040 --> 00:55:07.720]   Just wild, some of the stuff they're doing.
[00:55:07.720 --> 00:55:09.080]   If you want to know more, of course,
[00:55:09.080 --> 00:55:11.120]   take a look at the 2012 Ford Focus.
[00:55:11.120 --> 00:55:12.200]   We're going to have a barbecue.
[00:55:12.200 --> 00:55:14.640]   We're going to have the focus here, aren't we?
[00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:16.960]   On November 13, it's the first barbecue.
[00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:17.400]   That's right.
[00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:21.360]   During Twit, we've talked to the pedal in the police.
[00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:23.040]   They're going to block off the street here.
[00:55:23.040 --> 00:55:23.760]   We're going to have a tent.
[00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:24.800]   We're going to have a barbecue.
[00:55:24.800 --> 00:55:26.600]   Ford's going to bring-- I don't know what cars, a bunch of cars,
[00:55:26.600 --> 00:55:27.520]   including I'm hoping.
[00:55:27.520 --> 00:55:30.960]   My next car, the 2012 Ford Focus Electric.
[00:55:30.960 --> 00:55:32.280]   And you'll be able to take a look at it,
[00:55:32.280 --> 00:55:34.640]   take a look at all the amazing technology.
[00:55:34.640 --> 00:55:37.080]   We'll let you know how you can get tickets to this.
[00:55:37.080 --> 00:55:39.240]   It'll be like a golden ticket because there's not--
[00:55:39.240 --> 00:55:40.400]   only 50 people could come.
[00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:43.000]   But we'll figure out a way to get you the golden ticket.
[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:46.320]   Meanwhile, go to your Ford dealer or the website,
[00:55:46.320 --> 00:55:49.520]   Ford.com/technology.
[00:55:49.520 --> 00:55:52.240]   Alan Malali, the CEO of Ford, came to Ford from Boeing.
[00:55:52.240 --> 00:55:52.960]   He's an engineer.
[00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:55.320]   He designed the 777 cockpit.
[00:55:55.320 --> 00:55:57.160]   This guy knows tech.
[00:55:57.160 --> 00:56:00.840]   He's made Ford into a 21st century car company.
[00:56:00.840 --> 00:56:03.600]   And I think it's just really exciting what he's done.
[00:56:03.600 --> 00:56:04.080]   We're really--
[00:56:04.080 --> 00:56:05.120]   He's a really nice guy, too.
[00:56:05.120 --> 00:56:06.280]   He is an idiot, sweetie.
[00:56:06.280 --> 00:56:08.600]   I just adore-- he kissed me the last time I--
[00:56:08.600 --> 00:56:09.560]   not on the lips.
[00:56:09.560 --> 00:56:10.080]   He was trying to--
[00:56:10.080 --> 00:56:11.080]   Was it a chicken kiss?
[00:56:11.080 --> 00:56:12.480]   It was a cheek kiss.
[00:56:12.480 --> 00:56:13.440]   Oh, it was a nice kiss.
[00:56:13.440 --> 00:56:14.880]   He was sweet.
[00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:18.480]   He came up and he just-- he gave me a little pick on the--
[00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:20.000]   I probably shouldn't mention that in the air.
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:22.600]   Ford.com/technology.
[00:56:22.600 --> 00:56:24.240]   Thank you, Alexia.
[00:56:24.240 --> 00:56:26.440]   Just a little--
[00:56:26.440 --> 00:56:27.000]   Remember that?
[00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:27.840]   Were you there, Eileen?
[00:56:27.840 --> 00:56:30.520]   It was in-- it was at CES.
[00:56:30.520 --> 00:56:31.680]   I don't remember.
[00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:33.040]   Yeah, maybe she just blocked me from her.
[00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:35.880]   Maybe I might have dreamt it.
[00:56:35.880 --> 00:56:37.080]   It was at CES.
[00:56:37.080 --> 00:56:39.720]   Probably didn't dreamt.
[00:56:39.720 --> 00:56:41.240]   But it happened to CES, Leo.
[00:56:41.240 --> 00:56:42.240]   That's true.
[00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:43.640]   It's true.
[00:56:43.640 --> 00:56:46.160]   I'm a little hurt because we were--
[00:56:46.160 --> 00:56:48.800]   we were-- what are you laughing at?
[00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:51.040]   I'm a little hurt because we were lobbying
[00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:54.280]   to become the official podcast of CES.
[00:56:54.280 --> 00:56:57.880]   And I guess CES has decided to go with Spike TV
[00:56:57.880 --> 00:57:00.760]   is going to be doing official CES coverage.
[00:57:00.760 --> 00:57:01.160]   You know what?
[00:57:01.160 --> 00:57:04.160]   They're better be a US seafood.
[00:57:04.160 --> 00:57:04.960]   What the hell?
[00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:05.800]   What is Spike TV?
[00:57:05.800 --> 00:57:06.560]   What the hell?
[00:57:06.560 --> 00:57:07.560]   Yeah, no.
[00:57:07.560 --> 00:57:08.360]   That is--
[00:57:08.360 --> 00:57:09.200]   Bad move?
[00:57:09.200 --> 00:57:09.720]   Bad move?
[00:57:09.720 --> 00:57:10.360]   Is that weird?
[00:57:10.360 --> 00:57:11.320]   Yes, that is really strange.
[00:57:11.320 --> 00:57:12.120]   Well, and I think--
[00:57:12.120 --> 00:57:12.640]   Like, any sense.
[00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:14.320]   I don't understand it anyway.
[00:57:14.320 --> 00:57:17.440]   So Microsoft says, we are flattered.
[00:57:17.440 --> 00:57:19.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:22.360]   So Steve Jobs says, I'm going thermonuclear war on Android.
[00:57:22.360 --> 00:57:25.840]   Microsoft says, oh, we're flattered by similarities
[00:57:25.840 --> 00:57:28.080]   to the Windows phone in Android 4.0.
[00:57:28.080 --> 00:57:29.800]   I think they're happy someone mentioned their product.
[00:57:29.800 --> 00:57:32.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:57:32.240 --> 00:57:34.600]   It's like, oh, our name's been introduced.
[00:57:34.600 --> 00:57:35.920]   Say something nice.
[00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:37.320]   One of the features of Ice Cream Sandwich
[00:57:37.320 --> 00:57:39.360]   is essentially the same thing Microsoft
[00:57:39.360 --> 00:57:41.400]   does with its People Hub on Windows Phone 7.
[00:57:41.400 --> 00:57:43.520]   It's a centralized hub with all your social media.
[00:57:43.520 --> 00:57:46.160]   And I actually love the People Hub on Windows Phone 7.
[00:57:46.160 --> 00:57:48.760]   It's one of the nicest features.
[00:57:48.760 --> 00:57:50.320]   Tim, what did you think of Ice Cream Sandwich?
[00:57:50.320 --> 00:57:51.360]   You've handled it.
[00:57:51.360 --> 00:57:52.160]   You've played with it.
[00:57:52.160 --> 00:57:54.800]   I was underwhelmed, I'm afraid.
[00:57:54.800 --> 00:57:55.880]   I was as well.
[00:57:55.880 --> 00:57:58.160]   I was hoping for more functionality, particularly
[00:57:58.160 --> 00:58:00.040]   more enterprise functionality.
[00:58:00.040 --> 00:58:01.360]   As all these companies are kind of
[00:58:01.360 --> 00:58:03.040]   scrabbling to pick up the scraps that
[00:58:03.040 --> 00:58:05.080]   rim and blackberry are leaving behind,
[00:58:05.080 --> 00:58:08.440]   I was expecting to see maybe a better integrated Google Docs
[00:58:08.440 --> 00:58:10.480]   into the operating system, something like that.
[00:58:10.480 --> 00:58:13.200]   But what we got is basically better transitions,
[00:58:13.200 --> 00:58:14.200]   nice transformations.
[00:58:14.200 --> 00:58:15.200]   It's definitely a much nicer--
[00:58:15.200 --> 00:58:17.640]   And the Roboto font.
[00:58:17.640 --> 00:58:18.160]   Roboto font.
[00:58:18.160 --> 00:58:21.160]   They spent half an hour talking about the font.
[00:58:21.160 --> 00:58:23.000]   Yeah, they took it to Helvetica and kind of stretched it
[00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:23.880]   vertically a little bit.
[00:58:23.880 --> 00:58:26.320]   And that's basically Roboto.
[00:58:26.320 --> 00:58:29.320]   I mean, it looks fine, but I wouldn't
[00:58:29.320 --> 00:58:31.640]   be trumping it up on stage quite that much.
[00:58:31.640 --> 00:58:34.320]   There's some nice features like the face unlock features.
[00:58:34.320 --> 00:58:35.280]   Kind of nice.
[00:58:35.280 --> 00:58:36.680]   Yeah, except I don't think anybody's
[00:58:36.680 --> 00:58:37.960]   going to use the face unlock.
[00:58:37.960 --> 00:58:39.520]   Because even if you look at their demo,
[00:58:39.520 --> 00:58:40.880]   it takes like three or four seconds.
[00:58:40.880 --> 00:58:42.760]   It has to look at you, take a picture.
[00:58:42.760 --> 00:58:44.160]   Draw a circle on your--
[00:58:44.160 --> 00:58:46.000]   There's something interesting about that,
[00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:48.560]   is that that was a special build of ice cream sandwich,
[00:58:48.560 --> 00:58:49.480]   just for that demo.
[00:58:49.480 --> 00:58:52.920]   That was programmed to not kick out of the face recognition.
[00:58:52.920 --> 00:58:54.800]   Not only kicks after about two seconds,
[00:58:54.800 --> 00:58:56.440]   if it doesn't recognize you, but they
[00:58:56.440 --> 00:58:59.320]   had custom built this version of the out thing system
[00:58:59.320 --> 00:59:00.640]   just so that it wouldn't do that.
[00:59:00.640 --> 00:59:03.320]   And just in case there was some problem recognizing Mataya.
[00:59:03.320 --> 00:59:06.000]   And indeed, there was a problem that didn't recognize demo.
[00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:07.200]   It didn't work at all.
[00:59:07.200 --> 00:59:08.520]   Typically, after about two seconds,
[00:59:08.520 --> 00:59:10.880]   it'll jump out and it'll bring up the swipe pad
[00:59:10.880 --> 00:59:13.040]   or the number pad so you can type in your password that way.
[00:59:13.040 --> 00:59:15.360]   So it actually is much more convenient to use in real life
[00:59:15.360 --> 00:59:18.720]   than it looked on stage that unfortunately was a very bad
[00:59:18.720 --> 00:59:20.400]   demo for a variety of reasons.
[00:59:20.400 --> 00:59:21.640]   I feel like it just takes too long.
[00:59:21.640 --> 00:59:22.680]   I don't know if that's a gimmick.
[00:59:22.680 --> 00:59:24.000]   I don't know if anybody's going to use it.
[00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:27.400]   I was hoping-- was anybody hoping for a Siri-like improved--
[00:59:27.400 --> 00:59:30.440]   I mean, voice commands have always been pretty good on Android.
[00:59:30.440 --> 00:59:31.720]   I thought they would respond.
[00:59:31.720 --> 00:59:33.280]   Lancer nodding.
[00:59:33.280 --> 00:59:35.440]   Yeah, well, apparently they're not going to respond.
[00:59:35.440 --> 00:59:39.560]   They don't think it's important for the phone to be.
[00:59:39.560 --> 00:59:40.960]   Here's what's wonderful about Siri
[00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:44.960]   is that it is allowed to bring context to the voice recognition
[00:59:44.960 --> 00:59:47.920]   because it's got its fingers and all that stuff on the phone
[00:59:47.920 --> 00:59:49.080]   that all of these phones have.
[00:59:49.080 --> 00:59:52.520]   Your contacts, your schedules, your reminders,
[00:59:52.520 --> 00:59:56.560]   all the stuff that's part of every single smartphone
[00:59:56.560 --> 00:59:57.360]   we have out there.
[00:59:57.360 --> 00:59:59.640]   And Google, of all people, knows this stuff.
[00:59:59.640 --> 01:00:01.320]   They have a Gmail system with contacts
[01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:04.400]   where I'm able to get-- I can plug into those contacts
[01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:05.320]   from virtually anywhere.
[01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:07.800]   So they've had voice recognition for a long time.
[01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:09.840]   I have tried it out.
[01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:11.240]   Why not bake it in further?
[01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:12.840]   I don't know if they stand or make it improve.
[01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:14.000]   Make it even talk about it.
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.760]   In fact, Andy Rubin, then charge of Android at Google,
[01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:21.680]   said, I don't believe your phone should be an assistant.
[01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:24.240]   It's like, not only are we not going to compete,
[01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:25.760]   we think it's the wrong direction.
[01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:27.560]   It's just nobody's going to want that.
[01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:30.560]   We asked about this in particular.
[01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:33.000]   We talked to Matthias, who's the lead designer of ice cream
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:34.360]   sandwich, Matthias Duarte.
[01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:36.440]   And he said, basically, that at Google,
[01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:39.280]   they're going for the Star Trek approach, which is you ask
[01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:41.520]   the computer something and it gives you a response.
[01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:44.200]   And Apple, he likened Siri to the Star Wars approach,
[01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:46.400]   where droids have personalities.
[01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:48.440]   You can speak with them, have conversations.
[01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:51.240]   He said that that's the wrong approach for your phone,
[01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:51.680]   basically.
[01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:54.560]   He said that your phone should request and give you an answer.
[01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:55.800]   And that's the end of that.
[01:00:55.800 --> 01:00:56.560]   He should talk back to you.
[01:00:56.560 --> 01:00:58.120]   It shouldn't interact with you in any way.
[01:00:58.120 --> 01:00:59.160]   It shouldn't give you advice.
[01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:02.280]   I think Rubin says trying to be devil's advocate.
[01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:03.720]   Well, let me ask.
[01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:07.440]   How many of you have used Siri consistently for Lance?
[01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:09.400]   You have a little bit.
[01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:10.840]   I am obviously.
[01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:12.640]   I'm using it all week.
[01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:15.560]   I thought there's always a toss up.
[01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:18.120]   Is this going to be another FaceTime, where it's a cool demo,
[01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:19.120]   but nobody's going to use it?
[01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:21.040]   Or is this going to be actually a value?
[01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:22.400]   And I've found it quite valuable.
[01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:25.520]   I actually think that Siri is a breakthrough.
[01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:27.480]   I think Andy's wrong.
[01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:29.120]   It'll be a real breakthrough for me
[01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:32.360]   when it can do more things in a provider's standpoint.
[01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:35.280]   When it can read emails or it can read me web pages,
[01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:37.760]   when I can sit in my car and have my inbox read to me,
[01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:40.200]   rather than listening to NPR or listening to a podcast
[01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:40.760]   or something like that.
[01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:42.680]   Yeah, no, I mean, it's not tied into a lot of stuff.
[01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:45.080]   But at least just even setting reminders.
[01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:46.240]   I used it a lot for some.
[01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:47.320]   What do you think of listening?
[01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:48.480]   I think reminders is great.
[01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:50.080]   Minders is great.
[01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:52.520]   I don't think people have understood
[01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:55.920]   when you take location and time and cross them like that.
[01:01:55.920 --> 01:02:00.360]   You can say, OK, remind me when I walk into whatever
[01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:02.000]   conference room or whatever thing.
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:03.000]   Exactly.
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:04.240]   When I leave here--
[01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:05.240]   --it's going to be a little too Leo.
[01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:07.240]   Yeah, when I leave here, don't forget to pick up some milk.
[01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:08.840]   And it actually does that.
[01:02:08.840 --> 01:02:10.800]   It has a GPS, which is probably what's
[01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:12.000]   killing the battery, by the way.
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:12.920]   It's absolutely--
[01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:13.920]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:15.000]   --what's killing the battery.
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.160]   I mean, it's running notifications constantly.
[01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:18.840]   I'm getting notifications from yammer.
[01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:21.080]   I mean, there's apps that are--
[01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:23.160]   Cora's telling me when people answer my questions.
[01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:24.720]   And then you have to go in the back end
[01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:25.800]   and shut everything up.
[01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:27.200]   I have, in fact, done that.
[01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:30.840]   I've spent like an hour with notifications fine-tuning it.
[01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:31.920]   Yeah, I've shut a lot.
[01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:33.920]   It needs to be done.
[01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:36.280]   You should go into your location services, too,
[01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:38.480]   and turn off automatic GPS on a lot of stuff.
[01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:39.440]   Yeah.
[01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:43.360]   So-- but nevertheless, I think-- and I agree with you, Tim.
[01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:44.680]   It needs to be connected to more things.
[01:02:44.680 --> 01:02:47.240]   But even for the few things it's connected with,
[01:02:47.240 --> 01:02:49.320]   it's kind of a game changer already.
[01:02:49.320 --> 01:02:50.320]   It definitely is.
[01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:52.160]   It's a pretty first step.
[01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:53.480]   It's a first step.
[01:02:53.480 --> 01:02:54.560]   But I think Andy's wrong.
[01:02:54.560 --> 01:02:58.000]   I think this-- I do want Hal 9,000.
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:02:59.280]   I don't want--
[01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:01.080]   And I think Google's going to have to respond.
[01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:04.200]   Google's going to have to bring this into Android at some point.
[01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:05.960]   Right now, there are these pretty comprehensive voice
[01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:06.480]   recognition.
[01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:09.120]   You can set an alarm for an 9 o'clock tonight.
[01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:11.640]   And it'll set up right in directions by voice.
[01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:13.240]   So a lot of that stuff is there.
[01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:15.720]   It's just going to take another step to catch up to Apple
[01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:17.720]   or to step ahead of them.
[01:03:17.720 --> 01:03:18.880]   And certainly Google can do it.
[01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:19.840]   Let's see where this goes.
[01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:21.280]   There's no question Google can do it.
[01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:21.680]   It's just--
[01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:22.680]   I wanted to--
[01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:23.080]   Go ahead, Lance.
[01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:26.320]   And don't forget that Apple did something very simple.
[01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:27.680]   They added personality.
[01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:29.280]   People respond to personality.
[01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:32.720]   They-- all the sort of the silliness that's
[01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:35.320]   in Siri that people have used really
[01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:36.920]   served a very important purpose.
[01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:40.640]   I think they've helped connect people to the technology
[01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:43.280]   and have made it that much more interesting.
[01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:45.800]   They've been countless stories online about the funny things
[01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:47.520]   that Siri will say.
[01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:50.360]   I almost feel like Apple 100% planned
[01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:52.040]   that as part of the marketing push
[01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:55.840]   to get people to think about and talk about the technology.
[01:03:55.840 --> 01:03:56.640]   I love it.
[01:03:56.640 --> 01:03:58.640]   We've got four minutes to the end of the Arizona game
[01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:00.680]   before 60 minutes starts, Lance.
[01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:01.200]   And Tim--
[01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:01.760]   All right.
[01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:03.440]   So we're going to do a couple more stories
[01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:05.000]   and then we'll let you go.
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:05.760]   I'm going to leave you off.
[01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:08.400]   So if I'm a little late, that's OK.
[01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:09.920]   You know, it's like going to a movie late.
[01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:12.800]   They're going to be coming attractions, stuff like that.
[01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:15.600]   You can arrive a little bit late.
[01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:18.480]   Verizon, by the way, will be getting the Galaxy Nexus.
[01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:21.520]   You confirmed that on Engadget Tim today.
[01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:25.080]   So they were kind of unclear about date and time and all
[01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:25.520]   of that.
[01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:27.680]   But apparently Verizon will carry it.
[01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:29.080]   Did they say when?
[01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:30.840]   They just said later this year.
[01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:33.280]   Nobody said anything more specific than November,
[01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:36.160]   but we're hearing November 10th will be the date for the Galaxy
[01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:36.480]   Nexus.
[01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:39.960]   And we're hearing October 27th will be the date for the Droid
[01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:40.880]   Razor.
[01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:42.120]   Those are unconfirmed at this point,
[01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:43.440]   but that's what we've heard.
[01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:46.680]   The Razor sounds like the one you might want to look at.
[01:04:46.680 --> 01:04:48.320]   Yeah, Razor's coming.
[01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:49.320]   Go ahead, Tim.
[01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:50.080]   First and then Lance.
[01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:51.120]   Go ahead, Tim.
[01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:53.200]   To me, it's going to come down a battery life.
[01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:55.560]   I mean, the NFC functionality in the Galaxy Nexus
[01:04:55.560 --> 01:04:57.720]   is something that I want going forward.
[01:04:57.720 --> 01:04:59.600]   But ultimately, whichever one has the better battery life,
[01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:02.440]   to me, will be the better phone, because the Razor will
[01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:05.360]   get ice cream sandwich sometime early 2012.
[01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:08.440]   So that differentiation point is going to be gone soon.
[01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:09.440]   Lance?
[01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:12.360]   Right, I was just going to say, I believe the Razor is scheduled
[01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:13.520]   for-- so we've got pre-orders.
[01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:17.200]   And I think it should be actually arriving in November.
[01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:20.560]   I thought they gave a date, but I can't quite find that.
[01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:22.480]   But yeah, it's pretty much scheduled to go.
[01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:27.280]   It's just interesting to me that there's just so many new phones,
[01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:31.360]   so many hot, big, thin, big screen phones,
[01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:32.560]   including the iPhone 4s.
[01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:35.200]   And I can't wait to see which is going
[01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:38.200]   to be the leading phone this holiday season.
[01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:40.240]   I mean, the iPhone for us.
[01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:40.760]   You think?
[01:05:40.760 --> 01:05:41.320]   OK, thanks.
[01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:43.280]   Because of the mythology around it and Siri.
[01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:43.960]   But no, no, no.
[01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:46.000]   I think that what the Android phones need to do
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.760]   is differentiate themselves, kind of like this Nexus one
[01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:50.680]   was doing around the camera.
[01:05:50.680 --> 01:05:54.520]   Because it's still very slow to take a photo with the iPhone
[01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:55.840]   4 and the iPhone 4s.
[01:05:55.840 --> 01:05:56.880]   The 4s is pretty good.
[01:05:56.880 --> 01:05:57.840]   4s is fast.
[01:05:57.840 --> 01:06:00.600]   4s is 1.1 seconds to camera.
[01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:02.240]   And half a second between shots.
[01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:03.360]   That's-- here, watch.
[01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:05.600]   OK, you got a shot of the-- here we go.
[01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:06.880]   Let's do this.
[01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:09.080]   1,000, 1, 1,000, 2, 1,000.
[01:06:09.080 --> 01:06:09.800]   Well, that's more than--
[01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:10.640]   There you go.
[01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:12.600]   --picture, picture.
[01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:13.320]   That's pretty quick.
[01:06:13.320 --> 01:06:14.600]   That's pretty speedy.
[01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:15.520]   And very little latency.
[01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:18.760]   I think that this is good enough at this point.
[01:06:18.760 --> 01:06:21.880]   And I think the fact that you can use the top button--
[01:06:21.880 --> 01:06:23.440]   you know what I feel bad for?
[01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:24.880]   It's camera plus.
[01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:26.440]   Because they were taking off the marketplace
[01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:28.400]   because they used the top button.
[01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:30.800]   And now they can't use the top button.
[01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:31.800]   I know.
[01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:36.240]   Have you ever noticed-- are the photos upside down
[01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:38.720]   if you'd use that button and then you open them
[01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:40.480]   on your desktop?
[01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:42.240]   Have you ever noticed that they're upside down?
[01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:42.720]   Oh, no.
[01:06:42.720 --> 01:06:46.880]   But that would be a failure of the accelerometer, right?
[01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:47.720]   Seen that a couple.
[01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:49.680]   So they're fine when you look at them on the phone.
[01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:50.600]   They look fine on the phone.
[01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:51.560]   I'll have to go.
[01:06:51.560 --> 01:06:52.960]   But then you offload them.
[01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:54.760]   Because I've done this a few times when I was doing--
[01:06:54.760 --> 01:06:57.680]   I did a whole story comparing the iPhone 4s camera
[01:06:57.680 --> 01:06:59.200]   to the iPhone 4.
[01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:02.200]   And when I was using the button to take some of the shots--
[01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:03.960]   because then you have a certain orientation--
[01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:06.320]   I looked out and go to load them on the computer.
[01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:08.360]   I'm like, why are they upside down?
[01:07:08.360 --> 01:07:10.360]   [GASPS]
[01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:10.840]   Well, you know what?
[01:07:10.840 --> 01:07:12.640]   I have photo stream turned on here.
[01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:13.080]   Let's take a--
[01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:14.800]   And in a minute or two, they will come down.
[01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:16.400]   We'll take a break and come back.
[01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:17.720]   And we'll see.
[01:07:17.720 --> 01:07:19.480]   We'll answer your question after you're gone.
[01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:20.960]   How about that?
[01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:22.640]   Oh, that sounds so sad.
[01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:23.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:24.840]   You can probably ex-subtack.
[01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:26.360]   All right, P.
[01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:27.360]   Let's just put it into it.
[01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:27.960]   Is it an ex-if thing?
[01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:28.760]   Yeah.
[01:07:28.760 --> 01:07:29.240]   Or--
[01:07:29.240 --> 01:07:30.000]   Is it a bottom?
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:30.520]   I don't know.
[01:07:30.520 --> 01:07:31.560]   I don't know.
[01:07:31.560 --> 01:07:32.160]   Are you--
[01:07:32.160 --> 01:07:32.960]   I'm not familiar with it.
[01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:34.120]   I mean, maybe--
[01:07:34.120 --> 01:07:34.880]   Is it a bottom?
[01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:35.640]   I don't know.
[01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:36.160]   But that's what--
[01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:37.160]   You'll have to ask it.
[01:07:37.160 --> 01:07:38.360]   Maybe Siri could tell you.
[01:07:38.360 --> 01:07:39.760]   Siri, why are my pictures of that?
[01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:41.920]   Are you a bottom or a top?
[01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:45.040]   Lance Hielenoff is the editor in chief of Mashable.
[01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:48.480]   I'm glad to be leaving right about now to go watch 60 minutes.
[01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:50.040]   Thank you so much for being here, Lance.
[01:07:50.040 --> 01:07:51.040]   We think the world of you.
[01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:52.360]   And I look forward to having you back.
[01:07:52.360 --> 01:07:53.640]   Thanks for having me on.
[01:07:53.640 --> 01:07:56.000]   Always a pleasure, Lance.
[01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:59.520]   And anything you want to plug coming up in Mashable?
[01:07:59.520 --> 01:08:00.000]   I think you--
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:01.000]   I think--
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:05.120]   We're doing the Mashable Awards, actually, which took off
[01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:07.760]   about, I guess, about a week or so ago.
[01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:12.440]   And you go in and you can vote for not just startups
[01:08:12.440 --> 01:08:15.160]   and technology, but TV shows and anything
[01:08:15.160 --> 01:08:18.320]   that's made a big digital or social difference this year.
[01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:20.360]   And it's going crazy right now.
[01:08:20.360 --> 01:08:21.560]   But definitely check it out.
[01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:22.960]   You can nominate once a day.
[01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:24.040]   So that's one of the big things.
[01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:26.320]   And then, actually, we've got a media summit coming up
[01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:26.800]   in New York.
[01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:28.520]   We're going to be talking about the state of media.
[01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:31.200]   And I just had a whole monster history lesson on our site
[01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:35.080]   about it because I'm so old, I can remember the history.
[01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:35.840]   Awesome.
[01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:37.920]   Yeah, I like the Mashable Awards because you could basically--
[01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:38.920]   do you still do it this way?
[01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:40.280]   Pick your category?
[01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:42.480]   It's kind of a free form awards.
[01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:45.280]   It's a little bit more structured this year, you'll notice.
[01:08:45.280 --> 01:08:47.600]   I think a little bit more sense to it,
[01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:51.720]   so it's easier to navigate and nominate the people
[01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:53.000]   and things that you want.
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:56.360]   And where are the awards going to be this year?
[01:08:56.360 --> 01:08:58.840]   Should be-- we should be doing the event at CES.
[01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:00.360]   Oh, you will because it was in Vegas.
[01:09:00.360 --> 01:09:01.040]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:01.440]   That's right.
[01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:03.280]   We'll be announcing the winners in December,
[01:09:03.280 --> 01:09:06.680]   and then we're going to have an award event at the show.
[01:09:06.680 --> 01:09:07.800]   Fantastic.
[01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:08.600]   Thank you, Lance.
[01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:09.920]   Go watch TV.
[01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:10.920]   OK, thank you.
[01:09:10.920 --> 01:09:14.280]   When we come back, we'll see whether my pictures are tops
[01:09:14.280 --> 01:09:17.640]   or bottoms, how they're oriented, because I turned on photo
[01:09:17.640 --> 01:09:20.840]   stream here, and they're starting to churn on me.
[01:09:20.840 --> 01:09:23.640]   I don't even know where they end up going, to be honest.
[01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:25.360]   I haven't played with this yet.
[01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:28.280]   To North Carolina, to the data center.
[01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:31.040]   Where somebody at Apple is reviewing each and every picture.
[01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:34.080]   Do you know that Android phones have a function where they
[01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:35.840]   automatically upload them to Google?
[01:09:35.840 --> 01:09:37.360]   Google Plus, if you turn it on.
[01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:38.760]   But yes, I love that.
[01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:40.200]   But they're private.
[01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:40.680]   It's great.
[01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:41.800]   Yeah, it's very helpful.
[01:09:41.800 --> 01:09:42.960]   They're private.
[01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:45.120]   We've been doing house shopping, and you can just upload all
[01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:47.000]   your pictures to all the houses that you look at,
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:48.160]   and they're all in one gallery.
[01:09:48.160 --> 01:09:49.120]   It makes it really easy.
[01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:51.120]   The thing that's a little disturbing on this
[01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:54.320]   is this uploads it to every machine, iPad, and phone
[01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:56.040]   that has photo stream turned on.
[01:09:56.040 --> 01:09:57.640]   And they're not private in the sense
[01:09:57.640 --> 01:09:59.720]   that anybody who owns those machines can see exactly what
[01:09:59.720 --> 01:10:01.840]   you just-- when you took a picture of your bum.
[01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:02.920]   Is it automatic there?
[01:10:02.920 --> 01:10:03.760]   I haven't played with it at all.
[01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:05.640]   It's only if you turn it on if it's something like that.
[01:10:05.640 --> 01:10:07.720]   But if you turn it on, as you can see,
[01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:09.200]   it's doing it right now.
[01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:10.680]   And we'll see what happens when we come back.
[01:10:10.680 --> 01:10:13.680]   But first, my friends, my dear friends, my sweet friends,
[01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:16.280]   my patient friends, it's time to mention our good friends
[01:10:16.280 --> 01:10:18.760]   at audible.com audiobooks.
[01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:19.760]   You ever listen to them?
[01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:20.200]   Nope.
[01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:21.640]   See, a person like you--
[01:10:21.640 --> 01:10:22.320]   I don't drive.
[01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:23.200]   You don't have a car.
[01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:23.680]   You don't have a car.
[01:10:23.680 --> 01:10:24.400]   I have a car.
[01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:24.840]   Do you ever go to the gym?
[01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:27.160]   I can't afford a car in San Francisco.
[01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:27.680]   Eric--
[01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:28.680]   It's crazy.
[01:10:28.680 --> 01:10:29.180]   I know.
[01:10:29.180 --> 01:10:31.840]   Mr. Schonfeld, please, pay this woman more.
[01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:33.480]   Are you still listening to audiobooks?
[01:10:33.480 --> 01:10:35.320]   When you go to the gym, you could listen to audiobooks.
[01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:36.080]   How about you, Roger?
[01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:37.080]   No.
[01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:38.560]   You guys are a bunch of losers.
[01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:39.320]   I like reading.
[01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:41.080]   Tim, save me here.
[01:10:41.080 --> 01:10:42.440]   This is reading.
[01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:43.240]   This is reading.
[01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:44.880]   It's every single word that's in the book.
[01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:48.360]   Only they-- it's like your mommy is reading to you.
[01:10:48.360 --> 01:10:49.080]   I definitely don't know about it.
[01:10:49.080 --> 01:10:50.720]   No, you don't want that?
[01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:52.240]   I like it myself.
[01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:54.160]   Audible.com.
[01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:56.600]   It's not-- well, if you're-- as if your mommy was
[01:10:56.600 --> 01:10:58.800]   like one of the great Broadway actors or something
[01:10:58.800 --> 01:10:59.800]   like that, or your mommy--
[01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:02.320]   I know that's awesome.
[01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:03.280]   Because she was--
[01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:03.760]   Baby, she was.
[01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:05.440]   She may-- was she, Tim?
[01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:05.840]   Anything on her?
[01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:07.440]   If I could-- your mommy was Sean Conner.
[01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:08.360]   She was an operator, though.
[01:11:08.360 --> 01:11:08.920]   So she was always--
[01:11:08.920 --> 01:11:10.080]   No, I think that would be incredibly--
[01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:11.080]   Who's your daddy?
[01:11:11.080 --> 01:11:11.760]   I am.
[01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:14.760]   And I'm going to read your book right now.
[01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:16.360]   I'm going to read your book right now.
[01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:19.360]   Shut up and go to sleep.
[01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:21.000]   Audible.com/twit2.
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:21.800]   So what is Audible?
[01:11:21.800 --> 01:11:25.240]   It's 75,000 titles.
[01:11:25.240 --> 01:11:27.240]   Not just books, but radio shows, performances.
[01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:28.000]   Look at the winds of war.
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:29.600]   Now, that was a classic Herman Walk novel.
[01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:31.040]   Loved that novel.
[01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:33.120]   It's probably really long.
[01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:35.560]   Yeah, 45 hours.
[01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:38.480]   Historical fiction about World War II.
[01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:40.560]   Very, very good book.
[01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:42.400]   This is the kind of thing.
[01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:44.520]   You listen to it, and you get into it,
[01:11:44.520 --> 01:11:46.440]   and pretty soon your commute just disappears.
[01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:47.280]   It just goes away.
[01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:50.000]   In fact, you wish you could drive more.
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:51.400]   You wish you could work out more.
[01:11:51.400 --> 01:11:55.880]   You wish there were more dishes to wash, more carpet to vacuum.
[01:11:55.880 --> 01:11:58.400]   Because you're enjoying it so much.
[01:11:58.400 --> 01:11:59.600]   That's what I love about Audible.
[01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:01.880]   It makes the time fly.
[01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:05.040]   And, by the way, you'll be surprised how many hours there
[01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:08.360]   are in the day that you could be listening to books.
[01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:09.240]   I listen all the time.
[01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:10.040]   I love it.
[01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:11.440]   I want you to visit Audible.com.
[01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:13.080]   Browse around.
[01:12:13.080 --> 01:12:13.880]   Look at all the books.
[01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:14.960]   Pick something that you want to list.
[01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:15.960]   Actually, pick two books.
[01:12:15.960 --> 01:12:16.800]   That's what we're going to give you.
[01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:20.600]   Two books for free.
[01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:21.440]   Look at this.
[01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:23.440]   William Shatner's new book.
[01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:25.120]   If your mommy were William Shatner,
[01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:27.680]   would you listen to a book?
[01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:28.400]   Listen, listen.
[01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:28.920]   I love--
[01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:29.560]   I think that would be America.
[01:12:29.560 --> 01:12:30.480]   I love Shatner.
[01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:33.160]   This is Shatner Rules, your key to understanding
[01:12:33.160 --> 01:12:36.280]   the Shatner verse and the world at large.
[01:12:36.280 --> 01:12:38.320]   I should love to have their name above the title.
[01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:40.480]   But my name was in the title.
[01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:41.720]   How can I turn that down?
[01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:43.760]   Yeah.
[01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:44.480]   Rule.
[01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:46.280]   Always be yourself, especially--
[01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:47.600]   You see how you listen to--
[01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:48.040]   Wow.
[01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:48.560]   Yeah.
[01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:48.800]   I don't know.
[01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:51.720]   That's exactly what he does at his panels, a dragon con.
[01:12:51.720 --> 01:12:52.720]   Bing's the Bing?
[01:12:52.720 --> 01:12:56.000]   No, he talks about all sorts of things about the Shat--
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:56.480]   Perfect.
[01:12:56.480 --> 01:12:57.160]   Perfect.
[01:12:57.160 --> 01:12:57.840]   The Shatner Rule.
[01:12:57.840 --> 01:12:58.560]   So that's one.
[01:12:58.560 --> 01:12:59.840]   Here's-- you like Pendulette?
[01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:01.760]   Sure, who doesn't like Penn and Teller, right?
[01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:04.600]   His new book is called "God Know."
[01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:08.040]   Signs you may already be an atheist and other magical--
[01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:08.920]   it says, "A Pendulette."
[01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:10.080]   A personal dishwasher.
[01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:12.240]   I worked with a man named Harold.
[01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:14.400]   Harold sent him lyrics and a little bit of money.
[01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:17.200]   He's saved up to song-palm companies
[01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:18.360]   that advertise in the back of the man.
[01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:19.880]   I got to tell you, it's like having
[01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:22.640]   Pendulette sitting next to you on your commute.
[01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:24.560]   That could be good or bad, depending on your attitude.
[01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:25.080]   Yeah.
[01:13:25.080 --> 01:13:26.440]   I think it'd be great.
[01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:27.720]   The time passes like nothing.
[01:13:27.720 --> 01:13:28.800]   So here's the deal.
[01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:31.320]   If you go to audible.com/twit2, you'll
[01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:32.960]   be signing up for the platinum account.
[01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:34.040]   That's two books a month.
[01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:34.960]   It's a subscription.
[01:13:34.960 --> 01:13:36.400]   It really is best to get a subscription.
[01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:37.600]   You don't have to.
[01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:40.000]   But it's a really good way to do it.
[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:40.520]   How about this?
[01:13:40.520 --> 01:13:42.000]   Tina Fey.
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:43.480]   She could be your mommy.
[01:13:43.480 --> 01:13:43.840]   Yes.
[01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:45.000]   At least she's a woman.
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:45.720]   No one mind.
[01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:46.120]   Yeah.
[01:13:46.120 --> 01:13:48.880]   You want to hear Tina Fey reading bossy pants?
[01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:50.800]   I love it because you can listen to any book ahead of time
[01:13:50.800 --> 01:13:52.720]   so you know what you're going to get.
[01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:55.560]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:13:55.560 --> 01:13:56.480]   Tina.
[01:13:56.480 --> 01:13:57.320]   Aweshed audio.
[01:13:57.320 --> 01:13:59.120]   No, so they started at the beginning.
[01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:00.320]   I don't have the time.
[01:14:00.320 --> 01:14:02.440]   Chelsea Handler, are you there vodka?
[01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:03.800]   It's me, Chelsea.
[01:14:03.800 --> 01:14:06.600]   So you sign up for two books a month.
[01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:07.840]   Your first month is free.
[01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:10.040]   Your first two books are free.
[01:14:10.040 --> 01:14:11.960]   I don't dare play this because there's probably--
[01:14:11.960 --> 01:14:13.360]   it's laced with profanity.
[01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:14.200]   In lewdness.
[01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:16.040]   In lewdness.
[01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:16.560]   If it's--
[01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:17.480]   In vodka.
[01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:19.680]   And vodka.
[01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:22.000]   They've got stuff in business, classics, fiction, history,
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:22.360]   kids.
[01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:24.480]   I don't know yet because it's not out.
[01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:27.480]   But I'm willing to bet that--
[01:14:27.480 --> 01:14:29.200]   is it Random House, Simon Schuster that's
[01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:30.920]   publishing the Steve Jobs biography?
[01:14:30.920 --> 01:14:33.920]   They will have it on here, for sure.
[01:14:33.920 --> 01:14:36.720]   And that may be the best way to listen to the Steve Jobs
[01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:37.920]   biography.
[01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:40.080]   Just visit audible.com.
[01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:41.400]   Audible.com/twit2.
[01:14:41.400 --> 01:14:44.200]   Wait till midnight tonight to see if the Steve Jobs biography's
[01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:44.540]   on there.
[01:14:44.540 --> 01:14:45.840]   I bet it will be.
[01:14:45.840 --> 01:14:49.040]   They very frequently now get the books at the time they come
[01:14:49.040 --> 01:14:51.840]   out in the bookstore.
[01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:54.240]   Because I think the publishers now realize this is the way
[01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:55.400]   people like to listen to books.
[01:14:55.400 --> 01:14:57.280]   They like to read books by listening.
[01:14:57.280 --> 01:14:58.600]   Audible.com/twit2.
[01:14:58.600 --> 01:14:59.280]   Two books free.
[01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:02.400]   It plays on every device known to man,
[01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:04.760]   including by the way the Kindle.
[01:15:04.760 --> 01:15:05.760]   It's very cool.
[01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:08.320]   Audible.com/twit2.
[01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:10.560]   We thank them for their support of this week in tech.
[01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:12.120]   You really should listen to more audiobooks.
[01:15:12.120 --> 01:15:13.000]   It's really good.
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:14.160]   When I get my car.
[01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:15.400]   Well, you said you have a car.
[01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:15.960]   I have a car.
[01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:16.800]   It's an LA.
[01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:19.600]   San Francisco is so expensive for cars.
[01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:22.080]   You're paying $200 a month in parking.
[01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:24.400]   And then a bunch of-- like 1,000--
[01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:25.040]   Oh, that's crazy.
[01:15:25.040 --> 01:15:26.800]   --or to 2,000 for insurance.
[01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:29.440]   And you don't get to get a ride with Roger Chang.
[01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:30.000]   Jolly Roger.
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:31.320]   Thank you, Roger, for the ride.
[01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:34.080]   Every time Alexie is here, she gets you bums a ride
[01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:35.320]   with another house.
[01:15:35.320 --> 01:15:36.200]   But I love driving.
[01:15:36.200 --> 01:15:37.840]   I miss my car.
[01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:38.640]   But this is an LA.
[01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:40.440]   It's not fun to drive here.
[01:15:40.440 --> 01:15:41.200]   I love my car.
[01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:42.960]   I mean, I speed her.
[01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:46.920]   So I get the thrill of parking tickets.
[01:15:46.920 --> 01:15:48.720]   Or a speeding ticket, so expensive.
[01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:49.800]   I mean, I love my car.
[01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:50.480]   I miss it.
[01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:51.440]   I miss it.
[01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:53.120]   Yeah, but everybody in LA loves their car.
[01:15:53.120 --> 01:15:54.560]   That's kind of a given.
[01:15:54.560 --> 01:15:57.280]   So the LITRO camera--
[01:15:57.280 --> 01:15:59.280]   well, there was a lot of attention when they announced this.
[01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:02.240]   This is the camera that lets you--
[01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:05.160]   Tim, explain the LITRO camera.
[01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:06.640]   It's called a platoptic system.
[01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:12.600]   Effectively, what it does is it manages to capture lights
[01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:14.320]   at every focal depth effectively.
[01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:16.800]   So instead of taking a picture and setting your aperture
[01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:19.520]   and setting your focal depth, you're effectively capturing
[01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:21.160]   all focal depths at once.
[01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:24.880]   And then at that point, you can go through and dynamically
[01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:27.600]   change focal depth after the picture has been taken.
[01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:29.640]   So if you want a shallow depth of field
[01:16:29.640 --> 01:16:32.880]   focused on a very close subject, you can do that.
[01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:35.120]   Or you can get a shallow depth of field
[01:16:35.120 --> 01:16:36.640]   focused on something farther away
[01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:38.160]   after the picture has been taken.
[01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:41.160]   And I particularly love the ergonomic design.
[01:16:41.160 --> 01:16:42.040]   It's like a--
[01:16:42.040 --> 01:16:44.240]   It's like an overgrown lipstick or--
[01:16:44.240 --> 01:16:45.560]   Or kaleidoscope.
[01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:47.160]   Or a view master, right?
[01:16:47.160 --> 01:16:48.760]   It's like the slide viewers.
[01:16:48.760 --> 01:16:50.720]   It's like the camera of the future because it doesn't look--
[01:16:50.720 --> 01:16:52.600]   It looks like a lot of things, but it doesn't look like a camera.
[01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:53.160]   And it's for sure.
[01:16:53.160 --> 01:16:54.240]   How do you work it?
[01:16:54.240 --> 01:16:57.040]   Well, you just take a picture, right?
[01:16:57.040 --> 01:16:59.600]   You look at the screen on the back and you hit the button
[01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:01.520]   on the top, and you really don't have to worry about focusing
[01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:03.800]   obviously because it's capturing every focal depth.
[01:17:03.800 --> 01:17:05.640]   But now here's the problem.
[01:17:05.640 --> 01:17:08.320]   You can't look at this special picture
[01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:10.760]   unless you have special software, right?
[01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:11.160]   Right.
[01:17:11.160 --> 01:17:13.280]   It's kind of like embedding a video
[01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:14.600]   onto your web page or something like that
[01:17:14.600 --> 01:17:17.000]   in order to view that picture and to share it with anybody
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:20.080]   else who have to have a special encode to share it.
[01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:22.360]   And at that point, whoever's viewing it can click anywhere
[01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:24.480]   on the picture, and it will focus dynamically
[01:17:24.480 --> 01:17:25.960]   on where you clicked effectively.
[01:17:25.960 --> 01:17:27.880]   So it's kind of like looking at your phone
[01:17:27.880 --> 01:17:29.880]   and taking a picture, you know, tapping on the screen
[01:17:29.880 --> 01:17:31.880]   to refocus it, except you're looking at a picture
[01:17:31.880 --> 01:17:34.440]   that's already been taken, which is pretty interesting.
[01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:37.480]   And there's also-- so far, it looked pretty good.
[01:17:37.480 --> 01:17:38.920]   But it's one of those things that I think
[01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:41.000]   we're going to need to spend some more time with it
[01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:42.120]   to test that.
[01:17:42.120 --> 01:17:44.040]   We did get to go and play with the camera for a bit.
[01:17:44.040 --> 01:17:46.240]   But really, you need to kind of live with these things
[01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:47.880]   and find out if they were.
[01:17:47.880 --> 01:17:49.920]   This was kind of the same idea as the extended depth
[01:17:49.920 --> 01:17:52.520]   of field cameras, which have multiple lenses that
[01:17:52.520 --> 01:17:54.760]   capture pictures at different depth of fields.
[01:17:54.760 --> 01:17:56.640]   They offer the same kind of impact.
[01:17:56.640 --> 01:17:59.160]   And the idea there was that you could have a much smaller
[01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:01.560]   camera construction for camera phones, that kind of thing.
[01:18:01.560 --> 01:18:03.440]   But what we found with those is that you effectively
[01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:06.040]   give up performance for close in shots,
[01:18:06.040 --> 01:18:08.600]   specifically for macro shots.
[01:18:08.600 --> 01:18:11.400]   And, you know, that's a theory that perhaps
[01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:14.080]   will be some kind of glaring problem
[01:18:14.080 --> 01:18:15.440]   with these kind of cameras as well.
[01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:17.880]   It just strikes me as a huge gimmick.
[01:18:17.880 --> 01:18:21.440]   I mean, if you take a picture and want to print it
[01:18:21.440 --> 01:18:22.880]   or want to put it on Flickr, you're
[01:18:22.880 --> 01:18:23.960]   going to lose all of this.
[01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:25.720]   You have to pick some focal point.
[01:18:25.720 --> 01:18:29.680]   If you want to put on Facebook, there's a player for it.
[01:18:29.680 --> 01:18:33.440]   And is this-- I mean, how often do you want to do this?
[01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:34.840]   This is a special kind of--
[01:18:34.840 --> 01:18:36.240]   It doesn't solve a problem.
[01:18:36.240 --> 01:18:37.120]   It's a problem.
[01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:38.560]   I've never had the problem.
[01:18:38.560 --> 01:18:41.040]   Oh, I wish this picture could randomly focus on the problem.
[01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:43.240]   No, no, no, no.
[01:18:43.240 --> 01:18:44.760]   I think you're looking at it the wrong way.
[01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:47.680]   If you imagine taking a picture in a situation
[01:18:47.680 --> 01:18:49.280]   where you don't have time to focus,
[01:18:49.280 --> 01:18:53.120]   you just want to take a quick snap, say it at a social gathering.
[01:18:53.120 --> 01:18:56.520]   You don't have to worry about whose face is where and what's--
[01:18:56.520 --> 01:19:00.000]   Well, your other option is to shoot it at a high F-22.
[01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:01.120]   And then everything's in focus.
[01:19:01.120 --> 01:19:03.120]   Or pay attention to what you're shooting.
[01:19:03.120 --> 01:19:03.600]   Oh, yeah.
[01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:07.280]   I would pay $1,000 to Samsung, but not for my car.
[01:19:07.280 --> 01:19:11.840]   $1,000 to Samsung if they could stick an SLR on a phone.
[01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:13.320]   You know, something that--
[01:19:13.320 --> 01:19:14.800]   Well, and we have this feature.
[01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:16.040]   In fact, you said it, Tim.
[01:19:16.040 --> 01:19:17.520]   It's just like the feature on the phone
[01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:19.560]   where you tap what you want to be in focus.
[01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:20.400]   Yeah, right.
[01:19:20.400 --> 01:19:21.640]   Except you do it after the fact.
[01:19:21.640 --> 01:19:24.240]   What I'm always interested in is what this opens the door
[01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:26.760]   for down the road, because the big problem with watching
[01:19:26.760 --> 01:19:28.480]   a 3D movie now is you're effectively
[01:19:28.480 --> 01:19:30.920]   focusing on whatever the director thinks you should be focusing.
[01:19:30.920 --> 01:19:31.480]   Oh, great.
[01:19:31.480 --> 01:19:35.040]   I hope they have movies where I could choose what's focused.
[01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:37.480]   No, but I think about this is what I need.
[01:19:37.480 --> 01:19:40.400]   If I were in three glasses that can detect where you're
[01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:43.760]   looking, effectively, the film could be refocusing dynamically
[01:19:43.760 --> 01:19:44.840]   based on where you're looking.
[01:19:44.840 --> 01:19:47.040]   You would have a true 3D effect.
[01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:47.880]   Imagine that.
[01:19:47.880 --> 01:19:51.240]   If you're not nauseous enough, now you can really get--
[01:19:51.240 --> 01:19:52.480]   I think it's a copy of the world's
[01:19:52.480 --> 01:19:54.080]   conversation going to bed hungry.
[01:19:54.080 --> 01:19:58.280]   And then we're focused on finding different points of focus
[01:19:58.280 --> 01:19:58.480]   on it.
[01:19:58.480 --> 01:20:01.360]   I can sleep OK at night.
[01:20:01.360 --> 01:20:04.000]   It's just not something I think that this is--
[01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.280]   it got a surprisingly large amount of press,
[01:20:06.280 --> 01:20:08.360]   because I guess it's got a high cool factor.
[01:20:08.360 --> 01:20:09.640]   I just think it's such a limited--
[01:20:09.640 --> 01:20:10.560]   No, no, no, no.
[01:20:10.560 --> 01:20:11.440]   Think about it.
[01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:13.720]   You put in the Facebook-- say you take a picture
[01:20:13.720 --> 01:20:14.720]   of the audience here.
[01:20:14.720 --> 01:20:17.240]   They can go to Facebook and they can selectively focus
[01:20:17.240 --> 01:20:21.240]   their faces in the shot or whoever's faces in the shot.
[01:20:21.240 --> 01:20:24.400]   And that way, anytime you click on whatever,
[01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:28.040]   you get that person's name, you can automatically bounce over
[01:20:28.040 --> 01:20:29.960]   to their particular profile.
[01:20:29.960 --> 01:20:32.800]   I mean, it's great because it adds another dimension
[01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:38.000]   to an image where you can selectively let
[01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.840]   the user determine what they find most interesting.
[01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:42.560]   You're playing devil's advocate now, aren't you?
[01:20:42.560 --> 01:20:44.160]   No, I think it's a really cool product.
[01:20:44.160 --> 01:20:44.660]   Really?
[01:20:44.660 --> 01:20:45.160]   Would you buy it?
[01:20:45.160 --> 01:20:45.660]   Yeah.
[01:20:45.660 --> 01:20:46.160]   $400.
[01:20:46.160 --> 01:20:47.160]   $400.
[01:20:47.160 --> 01:20:48.160]   Yeah.
[01:20:48.160 --> 01:20:50.360]   You know, I spend $700 on lenses.
[01:20:50.360 --> 01:20:51.360]   $400 is not all.
[01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:53.760]   Clearly, you can afford a car in San Francisco.
[01:20:53.760 --> 01:20:57.360]   I buy a very relatively inexpensive use car.
[01:20:57.360 --> 01:20:57.960]   And I--
[01:20:57.960 --> 01:20:59.440]   Good question from the chatroom.
[01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:00.880]   Infallible wants to know, is there an option
[01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:03.040]   to make everything be in focus?
[01:21:03.040 --> 01:21:04.160]   You mean, yeah.
[01:21:04.160 --> 01:21:06.280]   Could I push a button to say the whole thing is in focus?
[01:21:06.280 --> 01:21:06.960]   Well, that's the thing.
[01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:09.120]   It captures all the information that you
[01:21:09.120 --> 01:21:10.520]   need for any particular focus.
[01:21:10.520 --> 01:21:12.160]   But can I choose it all to be in focus?
[01:21:12.160 --> 01:21:14.160]   I think you can also choose an infinity focus,
[01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:15.440]   or focus to infinity, so everything
[01:21:15.440 --> 01:21:17.200]   would be in shot.
[01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:18.560]   Well, you know, you're a photographer.
[01:21:18.560 --> 01:21:21.160]   You could also shoot at F-22 and everything would be in focus.
[01:21:21.160 --> 01:21:23.520]   Yes, and then you got to let it sit there for a while,
[01:21:23.520 --> 01:21:25.160]   unless you want blurred images.
[01:21:25.160 --> 01:21:27.320]   Well, I guarantee you, you're going
[01:21:27.320 --> 01:21:29.160]   to have the same problem with low light with this, right?
[01:21:29.160 --> 01:21:30.360]   How does this do in low light, Tim?
[01:21:30.360 --> 01:21:31.720]   Have you tried that?
[01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:34.480]   No, that's another thing that we really want to test out
[01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:36.400]   when we get the chance to play with it,
[01:21:36.400 --> 01:21:39.080]   see how it is in the real world with low light conditions
[01:21:39.080 --> 01:21:42.040]   with macro shots, with distance shots, the portraits.
[01:21:42.040 --> 01:21:44.760]   A lot of different scenarios that we want to play with
[01:21:44.760 --> 01:21:45.920]   and see how it works.
[01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:47.000]   It's interesting.
[01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:48.440]   I don't think that I would pay $400 for it,
[01:21:48.440 --> 01:21:50.200]   but I would love to have something like this built
[01:21:50.200 --> 01:21:52.520]   into my next camera phone, because it would just be--
[01:21:52.520 --> 01:21:53.520]   Right.
[01:21:53.520 --> 01:21:54.080]   --firing for you.
[01:21:54.080 --> 01:21:55.920]   You point your camera in the general direction of whatever
[01:21:55.920 --> 01:21:56.320]   you want.
[01:21:56.320 --> 01:21:57.920]   You tap the screen and take the picture.
[01:21:57.920 --> 01:22:00.520]   And you kind of figure it out later what you want the focus to be.
[01:22:00.520 --> 01:22:02.320]   I just think that sounds nice.
[01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:04.480]   It will not-- at least as exists,
[01:22:04.480 --> 01:22:07.720]   never being a camera phone that because it has to be in speak.
[01:22:07.720 --> 01:22:08.720]   It's too big.
[01:22:08.720 --> 01:22:09.760]   It's definitely too big.
[01:22:09.760 --> 01:22:11.840]   For sure.
[01:22:11.840 --> 01:22:13.240]   They'll have to invent a new way of doing this
[01:22:13.240 --> 01:22:14.400]   before it could be a camera phone.
[01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:18.120]   Also, for some reason, they've determined that red is 100 bucks
[01:22:18.120 --> 01:22:19.080]   more expensive.
[01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:20.520]   No, at 16 gigs.
[01:22:20.520 --> 01:22:21.440]   Oh, at 16 gigs.
[01:22:21.440 --> 01:22:22.120]   Ah, good.
[01:22:22.120 --> 01:22:23.880]   Hey, don't knock the product for a feature.
[01:22:23.880 --> 01:22:24.440]   I see.
[01:22:24.440 --> 01:22:27.240]   So this is-- so the graphite and electric bluer
[01:22:27.240 --> 01:22:29.680]   8 gigs, 350 pictures.
[01:22:29.680 --> 01:22:33.000]   Or you get 16 gigs, 750 pictures for $500.
[01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:34.960]   So it doesn't have removable memory either.
[01:22:34.960 --> 01:22:36.840]   So when you mug someone, go for the red one.
[01:22:36.840 --> 01:22:37.400]   Yeah.
[01:22:37.400 --> 01:22:39.400]   It has a USB port on it, though.
[01:22:39.400 --> 01:22:42.480]   So you can just-- it's kind of like a flip cam.
[01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:43.720]   And remember how well they did.
[01:22:43.720 --> 01:22:44.760]   They did pretty well.
[01:22:44.760 --> 01:22:45.120]   Yeah.
[01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:46.520]   They really well until somebody bought them
[01:22:46.520 --> 01:22:48.120]   and kind of ran them into the ground.
[01:22:48.120 --> 01:22:49.680]   Cisco.
[01:22:49.680 --> 01:22:50.160]   Yeah.
[01:22:50.160 --> 01:22:52.440]   Maybe Cisco will buy this guy.
[01:22:52.440 --> 01:22:52.840]   I don't know.
[01:22:52.840 --> 01:22:53.280]   Look at this.
[01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:53.720]   I don't know.
[01:22:53.720 --> 01:22:56.680]   I just-- so what good Roger would you buy one and come?
[01:22:56.680 --> 01:22:57.600]   Yeah.
[01:22:57.600 --> 01:22:59.600]   And show us this.
[01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:00.560]   I'll do that exact--
[01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:01.160]   Do that.
[01:23:01.160 --> 01:23:02.280]   I want-- he's Asian.
[01:23:02.280 --> 01:23:05.120]   You can do that.
[01:23:05.120 --> 01:23:07.840]   By the way, the publicity photos on the Litro site,
[01:23:07.840 --> 01:23:08.800]   you can't refocus them.
[01:23:08.800 --> 01:23:10.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:23:10.360 --> 01:23:11.200]   That's very frustrating.
[01:23:11.200 --> 01:23:12.600]   Yeah, very frustrating.
[01:23:12.600 --> 01:23:12.920]   All right.
[01:23:12.920 --> 01:23:14.080]   L-Y-T-R-O.
[01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:17.080]   When you buy one, come to the studio and take a picture.
[01:23:17.080 --> 01:23:18.440]   We'd love you to tell us.
[01:23:18.440 --> 01:23:20.280]   So we focus or unfocus Leo?
[01:23:20.280 --> 01:23:21.120]   Unfocus me.
[01:23:21.120 --> 01:23:23.640]   Take me out of focus, please.
[01:23:23.640 --> 01:23:27.360]   Dropbox got a quarter billion dollars worth of funding.
[01:23:27.360 --> 01:23:30.600]   That's a huge venture round.
[01:23:30.600 --> 01:23:32.440]   What was the-- the valuation was $4 billion?
[01:23:32.440 --> 01:23:35.840]   $4 billion.
[01:23:35.840 --> 01:23:41.320]   I have to think that Dropbox is a yesterday's news a little bit
[01:23:41.320 --> 01:23:44.440]   with iCloud and Google and everybody else getting
[01:23:44.440 --> 01:23:48.200]   into similar services, Microsoft SkyDrive.
[01:23:48.200 --> 01:23:49.960]   I mean, Dropbox was-- I love Dropbox.
[01:23:49.960 --> 01:23:50.600]   It was great.
[01:23:50.600 --> 01:23:51.560]   It was very hot.
[01:23:51.560 --> 01:23:54.840]   But it's now the time to be investing in Dropbox?
[01:23:54.840 --> 01:23:57.800]   I think the fact that it's cross-platform is a big--
[01:23:57.800 --> 01:24:00.240]   because I heard a lot of reluctance
[01:24:00.240 --> 01:24:02.640]   from venture capitalists to invest in this round.
[01:24:02.640 --> 01:24:04.840]   I think the fact that it's independent of one
[01:24:04.840 --> 01:24:07.440]   of the major platforms is a big thumbs up for Dropbox.
[01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:09.560]   It's why I use it because I can use it on my--
[01:24:09.560 --> 01:24:12.080]   in fact, a lot of iPhone apps use Dropbox
[01:24:12.080 --> 01:24:15.280]   to automatically sync text-expanding things like that.
[01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:17.880]   In fact, I'm using something else called Spider Oak
[01:24:17.880 --> 01:24:20.800]   for my-- because I can encrypt stuff from my day-to-day
[01:24:20.800 --> 01:24:22.720]   copying, but it doesn't work on-- everybody
[01:24:22.720 --> 01:24:23.800]   is supporting Dropbox.
[01:24:23.800 --> 01:24:24.840]   Dropbox got in early.
[01:24:24.840 --> 01:24:26.800]   They've got an API, so everybody supports them.
[01:24:26.800 --> 01:24:27.840]   So that's the advantage.
[01:24:27.840 --> 01:24:31.320]   And then Apple tried to buy them for nine figures.
[01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:31.840]   Really?
[01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:32.560]   They said no.
[01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:34.000]   I mean, according to reports.
[01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:34.520]   Wow.
[01:24:34.520 --> 01:24:38.200]   So the fact that they've managed to stay out of one particular
[01:24:38.200 --> 01:24:43.480]   platforms control is a big reason why they got the vote.
[01:24:43.480 --> 01:24:44.440]   Good news.
[01:24:44.440 --> 01:24:47.000]   You're not going to get cancer.
[01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:48.280]   Well, from phones.
[01:24:48.280 --> 01:24:50.360]   Well, yeah, you probably will get cancer from something else.
[01:24:50.360 --> 01:24:53.480]   But you won't be getting it from your--
[01:24:53.480 --> 01:24:54.840]   well, the odds are, right?
[01:24:54.840 --> 01:24:57.360]   You won't be getting it from your cell phone, at least,
[01:24:57.360 --> 01:24:59.400]   not according to Denmark.
[01:24:59.400 --> 01:25:02.520]   So this was-- I was a little disappointed
[01:25:02.520 --> 01:25:06.160]   because the World Health Organization, a short while ago,
[01:25:06.160 --> 01:25:09.480]   put out a study that implied that, well, we don't know,
[01:25:09.480 --> 01:25:11.960]   you might be getting cancer.
[01:25:11.960 --> 01:25:14.760]   That phones are possibly carcinogenic.
[01:25:14.760 --> 01:25:17.280]   And it scared the hell out of everybody
[01:25:17.280 --> 01:25:18.720]   who didn't read between the lines.
[01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:20.360]   They just thought the World Health Organization
[01:25:20.360 --> 01:25:21.880]   was saying that phones were bad.
[01:25:21.880 --> 01:25:27.000]   Well, turns out, because Denmark has these very bizarre privacy
[01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:30.240]   rules, we can pretty much rule out cancer from cell phones.
[01:25:30.240 --> 01:25:33.720]   Since 1968, every adult citizen of Denmark
[01:25:33.720 --> 01:25:36.720]   has had a national ID number.
[01:25:36.720 --> 01:25:39.160]   Cell phone companies have used that ID number
[01:25:39.160 --> 01:25:40.680]   to register subscribers.
[01:25:40.680 --> 01:25:44.120]   So you can basically take the whole Danish population
[01:25:44.120 --> 01:25:47.120]   and figure out whether they have cell phone accounts.
[01:25:47.120 --> 01:25:48.960]   And then-- and this is very convenient--
[01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:51.400]   the country's Institute of Cancer Epidemiology
[01:25:51.400 --> 01:25:55.800]   is also tracking anybody born after 1924
[01:25:55.800 --> 01:25:57.800]   by their national ID number.
[01:25:57.800 --> 01:25:59.200]   So it was just a matter of matching.
[01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:03.080]   And apparently, with 360,000 people
[01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:05.000]   who had cell phone subscriptions in Denmark
[01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:08.320]   during the study period, a million other control people
[01:26:08.320 --> 01:26:12.640]   who didn't, it seems pretty clear that there
[01:26:12.640 --> 01:26:18.000]   is no higher incidence of cancer in people who use cell phones
[01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.880]   over a long period of time.
[01:26:20.880 --> 01:26:24.120]   You can breathe a sigh of relief.
[01:26:24.120 --> 01:26:31.000]   In fact, it looks like you're less likely,
[01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:35.840]   if you're a male cell phone user, to get them an angioma.
[01:26:35.840 --> 01:26:37.760]   So there you go.
[01:26:37.760 --> 01:26:40.080]   Well, I mean, it's not surprising.
[01:26:40.080 --> 01:26:42.920]   People like to go on technology witch hunts.
[01:26:42.920 --> 01:26:44.480]   Being on the computer too much causes.
[01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:46.160]   But it was not unreasonable to think
[01:26:46.160 --> 01:26:49.440]   that if you're holding something that's radiating your brain
[01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:51.920]   for long periods of time, that there might be some risk.
[01:26:51.920 --> 01:26:53.440]   But it turns out the frequency of these
[01:26:53.440 --> 01:26:55.880]   that these are at the power that comes out of them.
[01:26:55.880 --> 01:26:56.680]   It's just--
[01:26:56.680 --> 01:26:57.480]   Oh, interesting.
[01:26:57.480 --> 01:26:58.400]   It's adults.
[01:26:58.400 --> 01:26:59.600]   I wonder if--
[01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:00.800]   I wonder because one of the--
[01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:02.000]   We don't know kids.
[01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.960]   Well, that's one of the big sticking points is like, OK,
[01:27:04.960 --> 01:27:08.240]   adults, for the most part, won't have any issues with it
[01:27:08.240 --> 01:27:10.320]   because they're skulls are thicker.
[01:27:10.320 --> 01:27:12.480]   Kids are developing.
[01:27:12.480 --> 01:27:15.440]   Well, especially kids that keep cell phones on their soft spot,
[01:27:15.440 --> 01:27:17.680]   that would be a problem.
[01:27:17.680 --> 01:27:18.200]   Yes.
[01:27:18.200 --> 01:27:19.200]   We do recommend again.
[01:27:19.200 --> 01:27:23.040]   So I mean, the worry is that the power is rated safely
[01:27:23.040 --> 01:27:24.400]   for an adult, but not for a child.
[01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:25.080]   Interesting.
[01:27:25.080 --> 01:27:28.360]   And so I had not seen any comprehensive study
[01:27:28.360 --> 01:27:31.280]   done on children on the age of 12.
[01:27:31.280 --> 01:27:34.840]   Because lots of kids now have access to cell phones
[01:27:34.840 --> 01:27:36.040]   and use them regularly.
[01:27:36.040 --> 01:27:36.560]   Right.
[01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:38.760]   So I mean, it's a good thing.
[01:27:38.760 --> 01:27:44.320]   I mean, like what was said is that for the most part,
[01:27:44.320 --> 01:27:45.800]   when people look at a new technology,
[01:27:45.800 --> 01:27:49.560]   there's always kind of that letite feeling that somehow it's
[01:27:49.560 --> 01:27:50.240]   bad.
[01:27:50.240 --> 01:27:53.800]   I think it's not unreasonable to consider it or worry about it.
[01:27:53.800 --> 01:27:56.680]   But I'm actually very pleased to see this study, which I think
[01:27:56.680 --> 01:27:59.360]   is large enough and effective enough
[01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:01.960]   that we don't have to worry about it too much.
[01:28:01.960 --> 01:28:05.160]   By the way, Baba, who must be in Australia,
[01:28:05.160 --> 01:28:07.320]   are you in Australia, Baba?
[01:28:07.320 --> 01:28:08.400]   Because they got the book.
[01:28:08.400 --> 01:28:09.440]   It's passed a night there.
[01:28:09.440 --> 01:28:10.480]   And in the UK is wrong.
[01:28:10.480 --> 01:28:12.920]   In the UK, he says he's looked for the index
[01:28:12.920 --> 01:28:14.640]   and I am not in Steve Jobs' book.
[01:28:14.640 --> 01:28:18.840]   So thank you for that.
[01:28:18.840 --> 01:28:20.640]   Any other stories that any of you want to bring up,
[01:28:20.640 --> 01:28:24.800]   Tim Stevens, anything that you're considering next week
[01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:27.400]   will bring us important?
[01:28:27.400 --> 01:28:28.720]   Well, it's going to be Nokia World.
[01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:31.000]   So I think that we are very much expecting
[01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:34.480]   to see the C-Ray or possibly the N800, which
[01:28:34.480 --> 01:28:36.400]   would be the N9 running Windows 5.
[01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:38.240]   You know, I saw that rumor that they were going to call it
[01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:38.800]   N800.
[01:28:38.800 --> 01:28:39.960]   They can't call it N800.
[01:28:39.960 --> 01:28:41.120]   They already have an N800.
[01:28:41.120 --> 01:28:43.560]   That can't possibly be true.
[01:28:43.560 --> 01:28:45.040]   Plus they already have an N900.
[01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:46.880]   I own it, N900.
[01:28:46.880 --> 01:28:47.880]   I want to know.
[01:28:47.880 --> 01:28:49.760]   I mean, they've just stepped back before.
[01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:52.320]   But we are expecting multiple devices to be unveiled.
[01:28:52.320 --> 01:28:53.960]   I'm hoping that we'll see something--
[01:28:53.960 --> 01:28:56.120]   the keyboard, I think that seems like a lock.
[01:28:56.120 --> 01:28:59.000]   But that should be very interesting to see what Nokia does
[01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:00.360]   with Windows Phone.
[01:29:00.360 --> 01:29:02.240]   And the N9 is great hardware.
[01:29:02.240 --> 01:29:03.760]   And MIGO is a great operating system.
[01:29:03.760 --> 01:29:06.520]   So I'm very curious to see if Windows Phone will be able to
[01:29:06.520 --> 01:29:08.680]   trump MIGO in terms of functionality.
[01:29:08.680 --> 01:29:11.520]   But we'll have tons of coverage, of course, from Nokia World.
[01:29:11.520 --> 01:29:13.160]   So you like the N9, which is running MIGO.
[01:29:13.160 --> 01:29:14.600]   You like that?
[01:29:14.600 --> 01:29:17.320]   Yeah, MIGO is a fantastic little operating system.
[01:29:17.320 --> 01:29:20.720]   Of course, it's hurting from lack of apps.
[01:29:20.720 --> 01:29:22.880]   Is it basically Linux?
[01:29:22.880 --> 01:29:24.760]   It's like a customized Linux?
[01:29:24.760 --> 01:29:27.480]   It's running on top of Linux, but it doesn't really feel like
[01:29:27.480 --> 01:29:27.760]   Linux.
[01:29:27.760 --> 01:29:29.360]   It doesn't really feel like much of anything.
[01:29:29.360 --> 01:29:31.680]   It's got this great way to switch between apps.
[01:29:31.680 --> 01:29:33.680]   Where you see full screen, what your app is running,
[01:29:33.680 --> 01:29:35.240]   and you just kind of toggle between your app,
[01:29:35.240 --> 01:29:37.400]   and you just pick right up where you left off.
[01:29:37.400 --> 01:29:41.880]   It's got a nice smooth flowing window of your applications.
[01:29:41.880 --> 01:29:44.440]   It's just a really nice, nicely put together operating system
[01:29:44.440 --> 01:29:46.640]   that sadly is basically stillborn.
[01:29:46.640 --> 01:29:48.400]   That really is too bad.
[01:29:48.400 --> 01:29:49.600]   It's a shame.
[01:29:49.600 --> 01:29:53.520]   Well, I would look forward to it because I do think Windows
[01:29:53.520 --> 01:29:55.280]   Phone 7 deserves some attention.
[01:29:55.280 --> 01:29:58.240]   I think it's in some ways an impressive operating system.
[01:29:58.240 --> 01:30:01.600]   And I think with the right hardware and Mango,
[01:30:01.600 --> 01:30:03.080]   could be something there.
[01:30:03.080 --> 01:30:05.080]   Yeah, I've spent some time with an HTC radar,
[01:30:05.080 --> 01:30:06.240]   which is running Mango.
[01:30:06.240 --> 01:30:09.200]   And it's a great little phone, but more importantly,
[01:30:09.200 --> 01:30:10.800]   it's a very nice operating system.
[01:30:10.800 --> 01:30:14.160]   I think Windows Phone is the kind of most intuitive,
[01:30:14.160 --> 01:30:16.200]   easy to use operating system right now.
[01:30:16.200 --> 01:30:18.680]   Certainly the most visually impressive mobile operating system
[01:30:18.680 --> 01:30:19.920]   that we have right now.
[01:30:19.920 --> 01:30:22.680]   But it's really just lacking in terms of apps and adoption.
[01:30:22.680 --> 01:30:24.400]   So maybe Nokia will help.
[01:30:24.400 --> 01:30:26.280]   I don't think it's going to have a big impact in the US,
[01:30:26.280 --> 01:30:29.880]   but nice hardware certainly never hurts.
[01:30:29.880 --> 01:30:31.240]   So, Leah, are your photos upside down?
[01:30:31.240 --> 01:30:33.680]   I'm trying to-- where do-- a question--
[01:30:33.680 --> 01:30:35.560]   where the hell do they go?
[01:30:35.560 --> 01:30:36.720]   The photo stream photos.
[01:30:36.720 --> 01:30:37.840]   Is there a special place?
[01:30:37.840 --> 01:30:40.280]   There was Steve in heaven.
[01:30:40.280 --> 01:30:44.640]   Besides North Carolina, is there a folder that they show up?
[01:30:44.640 --> 01:30:45.560]   Oh, wait a minute, here it is.
[01:30:45.560 --> 01:30:46.760]   Photo stream.
[01:30:46.760 --> 01:30:48.040]   That would be it?
[01:30:48.040 --> 01:30:49.680]   OK, turn on-- oh, I have to turn it on.
[01:30:49.680 --> 01:30:52.080]   OK, let's see if they're going to download.
[01:30:52.080 --> 01:30:53.160]   Is this safe?
[01:30:53.160 --> 01:30:54.480]   Were you taking pictures of other things
[01:30:54.480 --> 01:30:55.160]   before this show?
[01:30:55.160 --> 01:30:58.680]   Take a photo, import new photos, drag any photo.
[01:30:58.680 --> 01:30:59.520]   I don't know.
[01:30:59.520 --> 01:31:02.160]   Yeah, no, I was taking pictures just of--
[01:31:02.160 --> 01:31:03.240]   Are they coming?
[01:31:03.240 --> 01:31:05.200]   I don't know.
[01:31:05.200 --> 01:31:07.200]   No, it's just doing that.
[01:31:07.200 --> 01:31:09.040]   But the chat room has said, yes, that lands--
[01:31:09.040 --> 01:31:09.960]   Oh, right there.
[01:31:09.960 --> 01:31:10.400]   There we go.
[01:31:10.400 --> 01:31:11.160]   Wow.
[01:31:11.160 --> 01:31:11.960]   Are they upside down?
[01:31:11.960 --> 01:31:12.400]   No.
[01:31:12.400 --> 01:31:13.360]   No.
[01:31:13.360 --> 01:31:14.600]   So far so good.
[01:31:14.600 --> 01:31:16.240]   These are old.
[01:31:16.240 --> 01:31:16.840]   These are old.
[01:31:16.840 --> 01:31:20.320]   So we're going to have to wait a little bit.
[01:31:20.320 --> 01:31:23.720]   It's actually importing stuff-- all the pictures from my phone.
[01:31:23.720 --> 01:31:24.480]   Wow, that's cool.
[01:31:24.480 --> 01:31:25.840]   So far, nothing's upside down.
[01:31:25.840 --> 01:31:26.320]   This is--
[01:31:26.320 --> 01:31:28.520]   Are you sure this is safe for you?
[01:31:28.520 --> 01:31:29.360]   God, I don't know.
[01:31:29.360 --> 01:31:31.560]   This could be a first on Twitter.
[01:31:31.560 --> 01:31:34.400]   A picture of my butt.
[01:31:34.400 --> 01:31:35.920]   Are you just a first?
[01:31:35.920 --> 01:31:37.800]   Actually, really, I should think about this.
[01:31:37.800 --> 01:31:38.240]   Let me see.
[01:31:38.240 --> 01:31:39.880]   Is there anything in here?
[01:31:39.880 --> 01:31:40.960]   I see booze.
[01:31:40.960 --> 01:31:41.400]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:31:41.400 --> 01:31:41.880]   You can't, though.
[01:31:41.880 --> 01:31:44.320]   Don't show it yet, because that took the pictures
[01:31:44.320 --> 01:31:46.120]   of the penis cups, so that's not good.
[01:31:46.120 --> 01:31:47.120]   Oh.
[01:31:47.120 --> 01:31:49.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:31:49.360 --> 01:31:52.120]   There's a nice shot of my head.
[01:31:52.120 --> 01:31:55.080]   So far, nothing that I'm embarrassed to show Alexia and Roger.
[01:31:55.080 --> 01:31:57.000]   Is that a bookcase that's fallen over?
[01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:58.080]   That might be sideways.
[01:31:58.080 --> 01:31:58.960]   I don't know.
[01:31:58.960 --> 01:32:01.080]   OK, we're getting to the reasons.
[01:32:01.080 --> 01:32:03.640]   Wait, my son apparently borrowed my phone.
[01:32:03.640 --> 01:32:04.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:32:04.280 --> 01:32:05.560]   What the hell?
[01:32:05.560 --> 01:32:06.640]   Who's that?
[01:32:06.640 --> 01:32:07.400]   OK.
[01:32:07.400 --> 01:32:08.080]   It's a girl.
[01:32:08.080 --> 01:32:11.120]   There's somebody-- so far, nothing upside down.
[01:32:11.120 --> 01:32:11.960]   That's funny.
[01:32:11.960 --> 01:32:13.640]   My son, I guess, borrowed my phone.
[01:32:13.640 --> 01:32:15.120]   Or else he did it with his phone.
[01:32:15.120 --> 01:32:19.040]   And these are all right set up, and I did the special way.
[01:32:19.040 --> 01:32:20.440]   So there you have it.
[01:32:20.440 --> 01:32:24.560]   Live in studio, the iPhone at least under--
[01:32:24.560 --> 01:32:26.240]   or I photo, I should say.
[01:32:26.240 --> 01:32:28.080]   And that may be the key that using I photo,
[01:32:28.080 --> 01:32:30.000]   because I photo is Apple's own product.
[01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:34.040]   It may be on Windows or something goes wrong, or could flue.
[01:32:34.040 --> 01:32:35.960]   So there we go.
[01:32:35.960 --> 01:32:38.520]   Wow, this was exciting.
[01:32:38.520 --> 01:32:40.120]   Hey, I thank you all for being here.
[01:32:40.120 --> 01:32:41.280]   I thank you, Alexia Sosis.
[01:32:41.280 --> 01:32:43.480]   She is at TechCrunch.com.
[01:32:43.480 --> 01:32:43.980]   Thank you.
[01:32:43.980 --> 01:32:45.040]   Are you excited about Netflix?
[01:32:45.040 --> 01:32:45.840]   I see you in Netflix.
[01:32:45.840 --> 01:32:46.720]   I'm so excited.
[01:32:46.720 --> 01:32:47.560]   I can't wait until--
[01:32:47.560 --> 01:32:48.400]   Hordly?
[01:32:48.400 --> 01:32:51.360]   I get unreasonably excited about certain earnings.
[01:32:51.360 --> 01:32:52.800]   You covered Microsoft's earnings,
[01:32:52.800 --> 01:32:54.080]   call like that was a big deal.
[01:32:54.080 --> 01:32:56.240]   I thought it is a big deal.
[01:32:56.240 --> 01:32:57.680]   It's still very profitable.
[01:32:57.680 --> 01:32:58.800]   It's what?
[01:32:58.800 --> 01:33:00.480]   $18 billion in revenue.
[01:33:00.480 --> 01:33:01.720]   That's profitable.
[01:33:01.720 --> 01:33:03.320]   Plus, they're interesting, because they've
[01:33:03.320 --> 01:33:05.120]   got online services, which is being-- which
[01:33:05.120 --> 01:33:06.880]   is consistently losing money.
[01:33:06.880 --> 01:33:09.520]   I think it lost $439 million.
[01:33:09.520 --> 01:33:12.560]   It lost 270 last quarter, $4.39 this quarter.
[01:33:12.560 --> 01:33:14.000]   It's getting worse, kids.
[01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:15.080]   No, it's actually--
[01:33:15.080 --> 01:33:15.880]   Losing less?
[01:33:15.880 --> 01:33:16.640]   Losing less.
[01:33:16.640 --> 01:33:18.920]   It lost 500 or something last quarter.
[01:33:18.920 --> 01:33:20.000]   But it's still losing.
[01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.040]   So that's an interesting--
[01:33:22.040 --> 01:33:23.400]   to get into earnings calls, you really
[01:33:23.400 --> 01:33:27.720]   need to be on the micro level part of the incremental story
[01:33:27.720 --> 01:33:28.520]   of the company.
[01:33:28.520 --> 01:33:29.400]   Yahoo's are--
[01:33:29.400 --> 01:33:30.400]   wooden parts was there.
[01:33:30.400 --> 01:33:32.160]   They were fascinating, because she's saying,
[01:33:32.160 --> 01:33:34.920]   she's like, get me another Diet Coke.
[01:33:34.920 --> 01:33:35.880]   Hey, we didn't mention that.
[01:33:35.880 --> 01:33:38.680]   Is it credible at all that Google could conceivably buy part
[01:33:38.680 --> 01:33:41.120]   of Yahoo?
[01:33:41.120 --> 01:33:41.640]   No.
[01:33:41.640 --> 01:33:42.640]   Depends on what part.
[01:33:42.640 --> 01:33:43.140]   Why?
[01:33:43.140 --> 01:33:44.400]   Well, that's what they say.
[01:33:44.400 --> 01:33:45.520]   The good parts.
[01:33:45.520 --> 01:33:46.040]   Yeah.
[01:33:46.040 --> 01:33:47.440]   The parts that are valuable.
[01:33:47.440 --> 01:33:50.560]   The good part is in subject to US regulation.
[01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:52.320]   Well, I think Lance made a good point.
[01:33:52.320 --> 01:33:54.040]   They're not really a search company, Yahoo.
[01:33:54.040 --> 01:33:57.160]   They use Bing search.
[01:33:57.160 --> 01:33:58.280]   They're really a media company.
[01:33:58.280 --> 01:34:00.720]   They're a content company these days.
[01:34:00.720 --> 01:34:02.320]   I don't know why-- I don't think Google would want them.
[01:34:02.320 --> 01:34:02.800]   I don't understand.
[01:34:02.800 --> 01:34:05.120]   I think that that story is specious.
[01:34:05.120 --> 01:34:05.600]   Rumor.
[01:34:05.600 --> 01:34:08.040]   And we will see Netflix results this week.
[01:34:08.040 --> 01:34:10.520]   Boy, it's been a bad, bad run for the last few months
[01:34:10.520 --> 01:34:12.400]   for Netflix.
[01:34:12.400 --> 01:34:13.040]   Yeah, very bad.
[01:34:13.040 --> 01:34:14.000]   Expectations for that story.
[01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.240]   I hope Hastings talks about Quickseter.
[01:34:16.240 --> 01:34:16.800]   Quickseter.
[01:34:16.800 --> 01:34:18.680]   I can't believe he reversed his decision.
[01:34:18.680 --> 01:34:22.000]   I think if he had just stood on the, OK, we're
[01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:25.160]   splitting the two businesses, people would have gotten used to it
[01:34:25.160 --> 01:34:26.200]   and been fine.
[01:34:26.200 --> 01:34:28.640]   Now they just look like they don't know what the hell they're doing.
[01:34:28.640 --> 01:34:29.680]   Well, don't you think some of this
[01:34:29.680 --> 01:34:31.760]   is because they're being whipsawed by the movie companies
[01:34:31.760 --> 01:34:33.560]   themselves, that that's really the problem.
[01:34:33.560 --> 01:34:35.880]   And the long run, that's going to be Netflix's big problem
[01:34:35.880 --> 01:34:38.200]   is that their business is not theirs.
[01:34:38.200 --> 01:34:41.000]   It's what the movie companies will let them do.
[01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.360]   I mean, they need to figure out a solution to this.
[01:34:43.360 --> 01:34:46.360]   Like all of these music apps, like Spotify, you just take it.
[01:34:46.360 --> 01:34:47.800]   You take it from the movie companies
[01:34:47.800 --> 01:34:51.720]   and try to find a profitability model that allows you to survive.
[01:34:51.720 --> 01:34:53.080]   I mean, look at iTunes.
[01:34:53.080 --> 01:34:54.560]   Right.
[01:34:54.560 --> 01:34:55.480]   Charge the door.
[01:34:55.480 --> 01:34:59.160]   I think if they live at the pleasure of the movie companies,
[01:34:59.160 --> 01:35:02.480]   if the movie companies say you're done, you're done.
[01:35:02.480 --> 01:35:05.520]   And that's why I think Netflix has a problem.
[01:35:05.520 --> 01:35:06.120]   Roger?
[01:35:06.120 --> 01:35:07.160]   I still use them.
[01:35:07.160 --> 01:35:07.520]   All right.
[01:35:07.520 --> 01:35:09.400]   Roger Chang is at techzilla.com.
[01:35:09.400 --> 01:35:11.080]   And of course, the host of EatSmeets West.
[01:35:11.080 --> 01:35:11.480]   Yes.
[01:35:11.480 --> 01:35:13.840]   Anything else you'd like to plug while you're here?
[01:35:13.840 --> 01:35:16.000]   Yeah, watch Techzilla twice each week.
[01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.560]   And any time you're in Modesto, California,
[01:35:18.560 --> 01:35:19.920]   go to the seafood gallery.
[01:35:19.920 --> 01:35:20.920]   Fisherman's Gallery.
[01:35:20.920 --> 01:35:21.600]   Fisherman's Gallery.
[01:35:21.600 --> 01:35:23.000]   Fisherman's Gallery.
[01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.080]   And say hi to Mr. Chang.
[01:35:25.080 --> 01:35:26.520]   Is that your dad's name?
[01:35:26.520 --> 01:35:27.000]   Roy.
[01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:27.440]   Roy.
[01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:28.840]   Say hi to Roy Chang.
[01:35:28.840 --> 01:35:30.360]   Is it called the Jolly Roger?
[01:35:30.360 --> 01:35:30.560]   No.
[01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:32.640]   It's Fisher's Gallery.
[01:35:32.640 --> 01:35:35.840]   It's the best seafood restaurant in all of the Central Valley.
[01:35:35.840 --> 01:35:36.360]   Yes.
[01:35:36.360 --> 01:35:37.000]   I would say that.
[01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:37.500]   Yeah.
[01:35:37.500 --> 01:35:38.320]   That was easy.
[01:35:38.320 --> 01:35:40.240]   Where do they get the fish?
[01:35:40.240 --> 01:35:43.040]   Used to come from Pacific seafood up in Stockton.
[01:35:43.040 --> 01:35:43.520]   OK.
[01:35:43.520 --> 01:35:45.400]   So they just send out for it.
[01:35:45.400 --> 01:35:46.400]   Yeah.
[01:35:46.400 --> 01:35:47.880]   Thank you so much, Tim Stevens.
[01:35:47.880 --> 01:35:50.400]   For being here, Tim is the editor in chief of Engadget.
[01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:51.080]   Great to see you.
[01:35:51.080 --> 01:35:54.080]   I love-- and I've been looking at it all night--
[01:35:54.080 --> 01:35:55.120]   that painting behind you.
[01:35:55.120 --> 01:35:55.640]   Who did that?
[01:35:55.640 --> 01:35:57.960]   That Marlboro painting.
[01:35:57.960 --> 01:36:01.560]   This is actually a painting of Ayrton Santa
[01:36:01.560 --> 01:36:03.600]   that was done by a good friend of mine.
[01:36:03.600 --> 01:36:05.160]   So awesome.
[01:36:05.160 --> 01:36:06.160]   So there you go.
[01:36:06.160 --> 01:36:07.040]   Yeah, Ayrton Santa.
[01:36:07.040 --> 01:36:09.800]   I think it was in his 1993 McLaren.
[01:36:09.800 --> 01:36:11.680]   Is that Formula One or is it--
[01:36:11.680 --> 01:36:12.600]   Formula One, yeah.
[01:36:12.600 --> 01:36:15.320]   The season before his F.
[01:36:15.320 --> 01:36:15.840]   Awesome.
[01:36:15.840 --> 01:36:16.760]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:36:16.760 --> 01:36:17.880]   We do this show 3 PM.
[01:36:17.880 --> 01:36:18.360]   Thank you.
[01:36:18.360 --> 01:36:19.440]   Appreciate it, Tim.
[01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:22.440]   3 PM Pacific, 6 PM Eastern.
[01:36:22.440 --> 01:36:26.680]   That would be 2,200 UTC at Twit.tv.
[01:36:26.680 --> 01:36:27.760]   We already know a couple.
[01:36:27.760 --> 01:36:30.160]   Next week, we got who, Devorak.
[01:36:30.160 --> 01:36:31.640]   He couldn't be here this week.
[01:36:31.640 --> 01:36:32.160]   No.
[01:36:32.160 --> 01:36:33.160]   Eileen Rivera, our producer.
[01:36:33.160 --> 01:36:34.160]   Two weeks.
[01:36:34.160 --> 01:36:35.640]   In two weeks, we know who's going to be on.
[01:36:35.640 --> 01:36:38.680]   But we don't know who's going to be on next week.
[01:36:38.680 --> 01:36:41.680]   My dog, Aussie.
[01:36:41.680 --> 01:36:43.880]   At least.
[01:36:43.880 --> 01:36:45.640]   Anyway, we'll find out next week.
[01:36:45.640 --> 01:36:47.240]   We've got that barbecue coming up.
[01:36:47.240 --> 01:36:48.920]   Stay tuned for the Ford barbecue details
[01:36:48.920 --> 01:36:50.000]   so that you can come to that.
[01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000]   There's one next month, November 13th.
[01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:53.400]   And then there's one in December as well.
[01:36:53.400 --> 01:36:53.880]   That's correct.
[01:36:53.880 --> 01:36:55.560]   So that'll be a lot of fun.
[01:36:55.560 --> 01:36:57.840]   Thank you, everybody, for being here.
[01:36:57.840 --> 01:36:59.400]   We'll see you next time.
[01:36:59.400 --> 01:37:01.440]   Another Twit is in the can.
[01:37:01.440 --> 01:37:02.880]   This is amazing.
[01:37:02.880 --> 01:37:05.600]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:37:05.600 --> 01:37:06.600]   I'm on a Twit.
[01:37:06.600 --> 01:37:07.600]   I'm on a Twit.
[01:37:07.600 --> 01:37:08.600]   All right.
[01:37:08.600 --> 01:37:10.360]   I'm on a Twit, baby.
[01:37:10.360 --> 01:37:11.360]   I'm on a Twit.
[01:37:11.360 --> 01:37:12.360]   All right.
