[00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.480]   Welcome to another episode of This Week in Tech.
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.360]   I am your guest host sitting in for Leo LeCort.
[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.000]   I'm Jason Calicanas.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.600]   You can follow me on the Twitter @Jason.
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.960]   To my right, the one, the only, my partner from WebLogs Inc.
[00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.280]   And now the CEO of Cliffisodes Brian Alvey.
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.360]   Welcome to the program.
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.360]   Thanks.
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:20.560]   To my left, the greatest gadget inventor of all time who burned through over one hundred
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:29.320]   million dollars, 205 million dollars building the Q-Cat Dave Matthews, the founder of New
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:33.400]   Air and the gadget guy Dave.
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.840]   We're going to get into it.
[00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.640]   But when you did see Amazon release the wand, your vision for the Q-Cat.
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:40.640]   Yeah.
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:47.280]   Which you burned basically 200 million dollars on the GNP of many countries.
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.120]   And now you see Jeff Bezos release the 2.0 version.
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.440]   And Amazon becomes the most valuable company in the world.
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.240]   Did you sleep last week?
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.400]   Um, barely.
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.400]   It was tossing an attorney and all I could think about was ordering Whole Foods through
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.400]   my Alexa.
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.400]   Exactly.
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.400]   And we'll get into it.
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.720]   Also with us to the left of gadget guy Dave Matthews, the one, the only Peter Rojas
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:17.720]   founder of Gizmodo in gadget, gadget and now a venture capitalist.
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:18.720]   Yep.
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:24.480]   He has sold out two of the four people at this table have sold out and are now making investments
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.120]   to still building companies.
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.040]   And here it is everybody.
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.000]   If you are watching instead of listening here it is the Q-Cat.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.240]   Of course Leo LeBort has one of these in his museum of failed startups.
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.560]   They had to unplug it from his laptop.
[00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:38.560]   They did.
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.560]   They did.
[00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:40.560]   Do you still have PTSD?
[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:46.640]   How many years of therapy does it take Dave to recover from a $200 million loss?
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.400]   We just tell you a lot of people pay money for MBAs.
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.400]   I just do startups.
[00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.400]   It's $200 million.
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.400]   It's $200 million.
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.400]   It's $200 million.
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.400]   All right.
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.120]   Well let's get- We also give 300 other employees MBAs too.
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.120]   That's true.
[00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.120]   That's true.
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.920]   Well what I love about you is that you take it in stride and you're not bitter.
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.520]   And you gave me points for it when we won launch with New Air.
[00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.520]   I did.
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:07.520]   I did.
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.440]   It definitely is something that you can be proud of.
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:10.440]   Thank you.
[00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.080]   But it is one of those things being ahead of the curve as a technology.
[00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.080]   Timing is everything.
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.080]   Timing is everything.
[00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:16.680]   We've seen it over and over again.
[00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.360]   But this week there was huge news.
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:26.120]   We all woke up this week to find out that Jeff Bezos and Amazon had bought whole foods
[00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.400]   for over $13 billion.
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.600]   We were wondering if he was dabbling in retail.
[00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:31.880]   They opened a bookstore.
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:37.400]   They opened this very interesting cashier list store for their-
[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.200]   That's called the Ghost Store.
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:40.200]   The Ghost Store.
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.520]   You just grab things off the shelf.
[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.160]   So you don't need to scan barcodes even.
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:49.720]   And people were wondering, "Hey, is this these stores, is he just experimenting or
[00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.240]   is this actually a takeover plan?
[00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.240]   This is real business.
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.440]   Peter, when you saw this announcement, what did you think?"
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.080]   I mean it was a bold move, right?
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:03.080]   Because like you said, we've seen Amazon make these sort of tentative steps into retail.
[00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:08.360]   And I think a lot of us thought that their plan would be to roll out these Amazon stores
[00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:16.520]   like the bookstores and things like that and start to do this to more at a slower pace.
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.280]   They've dived right in with whole foods.
[00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:23.160]   I think the speculation is that, and I tend to agree with, is that this gives them a big
[00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:28.960]   footprint for being able to do groceries for doing the rollout.
[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:37.000]   But also to be able to do, add logistics to all these very affluent neighborhoods.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.760]   No last mile play in a way.
[00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:42.920]   Because now they have hundreds of stores that are within, I don't know what percentage
[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:45.440]   of the population lives within driving distance of a whole food.
[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:46.440]   Like all the 30 miles.
[00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:50.320]   I mean there's 431 whole foods in the US and abroad and very few overseas.
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:51.680]   So it's mainly in the US.
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:59.160]   But these are mainly in affluent neighborhoods which reach out to rich customers.
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.000]   But it's also a valuable real estate in and of itself.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.200]   And if they wanted to launch 431 logistics centers.
[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.200]   How long would that take?
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.720]   It would take years and cost them.
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.640]   If they launched 2 or 3 a month, it would take forever.
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:12.640]   Yeah.
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:14.800]   So they're diving right in.
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:18.880]   Brian, when you look at this and you see Instacart, which is extremely popular here
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:23.920]   in the Bay Area and a number of other places, Instacart has a multi-year deal.
[00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:29.200]   Instacart is loved and they seem to have figured something out.
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:30.920]   It was kind of terrible in the beginning.
[00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.320]   They got everything wrong.
[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:34.680]   Over time the shoppers have gotten better.
[00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.480]   Is this the end of Instacart?
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:41.040]   Is there any way Instacart comes out of this ahead in your mind?
[00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:42.480]   Absolutely.
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:48.080]   And it's because if you look at Florida, right, Universal Studios had a deal with Marvel.
[00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.120]   They had Marvel's Islands of Adventure.
[00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.240]   Then Disney goes and buys Marvel.
[00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.280]   They can't put Marvel rides in Disney World.
[00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:55.280]   Oh.
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:59.200]   So you go to Disney World in Florida and you can do everything but Avengers, Iron Man,
[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:00.200]   Superhero stuff.
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:02.760]   You have to go to Universal for that because they have a multi-year deal.
[00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:03.760]   Right.
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:04.760]   So it's a really weird situation, right?
[00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:08.780]   But then it gives them the opportunity Instacart to go to everybody who isn't Amazon and Whole
[00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:10.400]   Foods and lock them all up.
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:11.400]   Right.
[00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.400]   So I think that lights a fire under everybody else to start working with Instacart and it
[00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.440]   gives them a big out to be whatever.
[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:21.040]   Let's say Amazon ends up, Whole Foods ends up 50% of the market, 50% of the rest, the
[00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:22.040]   other 50% is Instacart.
[00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:23.040]   Yes, yeah.
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:27.280]   That was my hot take on it as well, which is I think Instacart just got twice as valuable.
[00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:28.280]   Correct.
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:29.880]   Now somebody has to buy them Target.
[00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:30.880]   Walmart.
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:31.880]   Walmart, obviously.
[00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:32.880]   What do you think, Dave?
[00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:34.720]   It's like all ships rise with the tide.
[00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:38.200]   For a while I was the in-house inventor at Radio Shack and there were some rumors that
[00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:42.560]   Amazon would use Radio Shack stores while they were going through bankruptcy as distribution
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:43.560]   centers.
[00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:48.360]   Now, if you think about what Whole Foods stores are like today, they're congested, they're
[00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:50.960]   packed with merchandise, packed with product.
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:54.440]   So I think this is only going to be part of Amazon's Fresh program.
[00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:55.440]   Right.
[00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:58.640]   Not going to have anything to do with any of the other supply chain stuff.
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:03.240]   So you'll still be looking forward to your drone sending your next package down.
[00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:05.600]   Now Radio Shack, it's interesting that you mentioned that.
[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:06.840]   So you worked at Radio Shack.
[00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:10.360]   Was that also a company that you killed when you were there?
[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:12.920]   Did you drive that one also straight to the ground?
[00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:14.720]   I left in 2004.
[00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:16.720]   So they closed that.
[00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:17.720]   Yeah, they closed that.
[00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:20.560]   Yeah, 7,000 stores down to just hundreds now.
[00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.560]   Are there still Radio Shack stores?
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:23.560]   There are.
[00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:24.560]   There's a rally.
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:25.560]   What do they do at Radio Shack stores now?
[00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:27.000]   So they sell Sprint phones now.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.360]   So basically they're just a place to sell phones.
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:30.560]   Well, you can still buy Radio Shack stuff.
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:33.640]   Why didn't they make them into like hack a day hacking makerspaces?
[00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:34.640]   So we did that.
[00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:35.640]   Isn't that your plan?
[00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:38.480]   So I was part of the editorial team on Make Magazine as well.
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:40.400]   And I brought Make and Radio Shack together.
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:41.560]   But at that time, there were no kits.
[00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:44.360]   Arduino was just still lab stuff.
[00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:47.320]   And we finally got maker kits inside the stores.
[00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:49.000]   But by then it was too late.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.280]   The transistors could not.
[00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:53.880]   This experiential retail seems to be the thing people want to do.
[00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:55.400]   And they just missed that timing again.
[00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:56.400]   Timing and really.
[00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:58.840]   A great example of a store you've probably been to a Peter the Little
[00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:00.160]   Bit store in Manhattan.
[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:01.360]   I haven't been to a better night.
[00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:02.360]   I know where to go.
[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:03.360]   Explain to people what the little bit stores are.
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:06.600]   So little bits are magnetic computers that you stick the modules together.
[00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:09.440]   So sensors and Wi-Fi modules.
[00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:13.800]   And it's great for kids because speaking of Father's Day, you can put these, clip these
[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:17.040]   together and because of the polarity of the magnets, you can never put voltage in the
[00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:18.040]   wrong way.
[00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:20.200]   So they've created an experiential store in New York.
[00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:24.000]   So you can go in and you can essentially have birthday parties and field trips at this
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.960]   store and learn how to program a very rudimentary.
[00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:33.800]   So when you see the wand, we were joking before that the wand is, and I saw you were playing
[00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:34.800]   with it.
[00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:37.080]   So here it is, the first time I've actually ever held it.
[00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:41.160]   And it is, I mean, it is just unbelievable to hold your invention in the Q-cat on the
[00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:42.280]   wand here.
[00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:45.160]   When did you release the 1.0 of the Q-cat?
[00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:48.920]   So this, the Q-cat you're looking at now is called a PS2 wedge.
[00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:49.920]   Right.
[00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:50.920]   And back in the day, they're PS2 connectors.
[00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:53.080]   We started inventing this in 1997.
[00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:53.920]   Wow.
[00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:56.240]   So 20 years ago, about to the day, it went in the wand.
[00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:58.600]   So 20 years and the device is essentially the same size.
[00:09:58.600 --> 00:09:59.600]   Yeah.
[00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:01.240]   And the technology is, it's got a barcode reader on the top.
[00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:02.240]   Yep.
[00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:03.840]   So this one uses a camera to read it.
[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:07.600]   This one uses an optical sensor that's more like what the mouse would use.
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:11.040]   And when we invented this, the optical mouse wasn't even invented yet.
[00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:12.960]   So we had to create a lot of new technologies.
[00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:13.960]   Cloud computing was around.
[00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:18.840]   So we literally bought Dell boxes and racked them up in server banks.
[00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:20.240]   We had to build our own cloud.
[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:22.040]   And obviously not wireless.
[00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:23.040]   Not.
[00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:24.040]   We have a wireless.
[00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.040]   We partnered with Cross.
[00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:26.360]   This has never been seen before.
[00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:27.680]   So this is a pen.
[00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:28.680]   A wireless pen.
[00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:31.040]   Cross pen on one end is a pen.
[00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:34.120]   On the other end is a Ruby tipped roller scanner.
[00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:35.480]   And you can scan and hold.
[00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:37.000]   A barcode is really good.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.040]   And then we also had the key fob as well.
[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:41.480]   The key fob again, a portable one.
[00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:46.320]   And what's really clever about these is they modulated their tips, the light, just like
[00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:50.040]   an IR protocol that was a modified protocol to send the data down.
[00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:53.440]   Now what is this device, the Amazon wand for?
[00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:54.640]   You were playing with it.
[00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:55.640]   What do you think?
[00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:56.880]   Yeah, I put up an Instagram video.
[00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:00.440]   If you guys look at @GGDM, you can see the video of it working in the name of it.
[00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:01.920]   Yeah, Dave Matthews.
[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:02.920]   Exactly.
[00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:06.640]   So the button on it, and it's not connected to the Wi-Fi here, but it is a skull.
[00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:09.000]   It has a decent speaker in it, surprisingly.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   And you can push the button.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.440]   Oh, it's got an order caviar, the most expensive you have.
[00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:13.440]   A double order, please.
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:14.760]   Thank you.
[00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:19.480]   So unfortunately for Jason, but fortunately for my bank account, that will not go through
[00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:21.120]   because there's no Wi-Fi connected to it.
[00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:22.120]   But that's essentially the use case.
[00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:24.120]   It's got an order, 20 pounds of foie gras.
[00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:26.120]   It's got a boy's eye connection.
[00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:27.120]   There it is.
[00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:29.120]   But the poor thing is people are listening to Twitter right now.
[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:30.120]   It just said that it will be back.
[00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:31.120]   20 grams.
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:32.120]   Right.
[00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:33.600]   By the way, it's been a run out of foie gras.
[00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:38.120]   I've just been hacked because she said we'll restore the connection and then put the order
[00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:39.120]   through.
[00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:40.120]   Fantastic.
[00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:41.120]   So it does have a buffer.
[00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:43.480]   When you go to the bathroom, we're going to order a ton of embarrassing products.
[00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:46.680]   And then the scanner, the Q-CAT, you had to touch the optical surface.
[00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:51.800]   On this scanner, you can use a few inches away and red beans comes out.
[00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:55.600]   So it's $20, but it's subsidized with your first order with it.
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:59.000]   So it's essentially free and it's sold out now immediately, of course, because it's
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   necessary.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.600]   Peter, what does that cost to make, you think?
[00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:03.800]   I think I was very little at this point.
[00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:04.800]   Yeah.
[00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:09.640]   I mean, you can buy these Wi-Fi chipsets and I don't think it requires very much to run.
[00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:11.640]   It runs off to 2.
[00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:12.640]   Triple A's?
[00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:13.800]   Yeah, it's run out of a scallop.
[00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:16.960]   And so I would say that they're probably breaking even on them.
[00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:21.480]   I think it probably cost them $15, $20, but they assume that they're going to sell enough
[00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:25.800]   extra stuff by having these people's homes that it's totally worth the loss.
[00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:32.200]   Are you going to get one and do you think that this is a, this combination of the wand?
[00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:36.480]   And let's just call it Walmart Instacart because we'll assume that they'll keep the
[00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:37.840]   Instacart relationship.
[00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:41.040]   And in other markets where they don't have Instacart, they'll make their own, you know,
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:43.080]   Amazon Fresh Delivery.
[00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:46.880]   Do you think that this is going to be the standard for all homes in the United States
[00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:50.920]   within whatever reach of a city is that you'll never go to a grocery store unless you really
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:51.920]   want to?
[00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:56.880]   Well, I mean, I think that as someone who's been an Instacart user since, I mean, it was
[00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:00.560]   first introduced in New York when I lived in New York, there is a convenience factor
[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:03.120]   that is really hard to, to overlook, right?
[00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:06.520]   When you have something like this, it's, there are definitely some things that you miss
[00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:07.520]   by not going to a grocery store.
[00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:11.520]   And in fact, grocers are actually starting to notice that it's actually hard to upsell
[00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:15.920]   you when you have a list of things that you always order all the time.
[00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:17.600]   And then for a lot of new food brands.
[00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:19.200]   But that's their problem, not all of them.
[00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:20.200]   It's not exactly.
[00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:21.720]   People magazine's problem in the checkout line.
[00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:22.720]   Yeah.
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:26.360]   But, but you can imagine that if you are trying to introduce a new food brand right now, you
[00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:31.600]   have a real challenge because the end case was one of the ways that grocery stores tried
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:32.600]   to promote new products.
[00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:33.600]   And in fact, come.
[00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:36.560]   When you say the end case, you're fine with that is the end.
[00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:41.000]   So the, yeah, the end of the, of the aisle where, and companies are actually pay to rent
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.520]   that space to promote their new product, whatever it is.
[00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:47.840]   Which is why sometimes you go to the grocery store and you'll see your coffee brand in
[00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:49.680]   the coffee aisle and also in the end, yeah.
[00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:50.680]   Exactly.
[00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:55.920]   It's a source of revenue that grocery stores are, we'll have to forego because it's less
[00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:57.440]   valuable real estate if people aren't coming in.
[00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:01.800]   If most of the people walking down your aisles are Instacart shoppers, it's not as valuable.
[00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:05.080]   Brian, you live in the East Bay here in the Bay Area.
[00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:06.080]   Do you have Instacart?
[00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:09.480]   No, I have a family and we load up the car and we bring it home.
[00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:11.480]   But there are buildings in San Francisco.
[00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:12.960]   And by the way, we're sorry.
[00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:16.200]   I mean, in a way, like when you hear, when you hear that he goes to the grocery store,
[00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:17.440]   do you feel pity for Brian?
[00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:19.400]   I literally feel bad for you.
[00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:20.400]   I guess.
[00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:21.400]   But you have to go there.
[00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:22.400]   It's, isn't it?
[00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:23.400]   It gets me away from the pets.
[00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:24.400]   Yeah, Costco used to be exciting.
[00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:25.400]   I find it.
[00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:26.400]   That was your risk to go.
[00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:27.400]   Yeah.
[00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:28.400]   Now Costco is the worst place on earth.
[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:29.400]   No, you pick, you pick your times.
[00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:31.280]   But in San Francisco, there are buildings that this, one of the selling points is they
[00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:32.280]   have a deal with Safeway.
[00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:35.960]   Well, while you're at work, you put in your order and it's not even through an Instacart
[00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:37.280]   or an Amazon or anything like that.
[00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:40.600]   Just whatever, you know, a pecan or whatever things Safeway is using or what these grocery
[00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:41.600]   stores.
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:43.920]   And they will just come and they have a key to your apartment.
[00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:46.880]   They will unload it all into your cabinets and into your refrigerator and your freezer.
[00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:49.960]   Well, you actually see that buildings are being, new buildings, apartment buildings
[00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:53.720]   are being designed to be able to take in groceries, right?
[00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:56.240]   And they have special rooms that are, you know, cool and things like that or they'll
[00:14:56.240 --> 00:15:00.840]   have the apartment's designed with special, you know, containers, containers just adjacent
[00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:02.360]   to the front door.
[00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:06.840]   But also because of Amazon apartment buildings are just generally having to redesign their
[00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:09.240]   mail rooms and things like that to accommodate too many packages.
[00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:10.240]   Too many packages.
[00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:13.600]   But what's new is old and just like the Amazon wand is just like my 20 year old invention,
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:18.120]   my apartment in San Francisco from 1929 had an ice box.
[00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:22.200]   It was a box that you would put ice in and it had two doors, one door on the outside
[00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:26.920]   where the milk man would come with the milk in and loaded up with a cube of, you know,
[00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:28.000]   brick of ice.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.920]   And then the other door was on the inside of the house to let me retrieve that milk.
[00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:36.360]   And you know, package security is actually, I mean, I'm on next door and half the poster
[00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:38.720]   people complaining about their Amazon packages being stolen.
[00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:41.960]   How do these people not have a ring doorbell or a butterfly or a drawing?
[00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:44.600]   Well, it's funny because ring is now one I think one of the biggest advertisers on
[00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:45.600]   next door.
[00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:46.600]   It's interesting.
[00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:47.600]   Yeah.
[00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:48.600]   And I just I just have one installed last week.
[00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:49.600]   You had a ring doorbell.
[00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:50.600]   Yeah.
[00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:52.240]   I mean, I had cameras before, but I figured it was just a lot simpler to have.
[00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:55.960]   How many cameras does everybody here have in their homes right now?
[00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:57.440]   Security cameras.
[00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:59.160]   I have eight or nine.
[00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:00.160]   Yeah.
[00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:01.160]   Well, I did sling box.
[00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:04.120]   So I would put cameras literally everywhere like one on top of the Transamerica building
[00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:06.360]   one on top of the Golden Grape Bitch toll.
[00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:07.360]   Pass through.
[00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:08.840]   So I have cameras scattered about.
[00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:10.920]   Yeah, I'm not talking about your work for the CIA.
[00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:12.960]   I'm just strictly about your home.
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:14.960]   Just for how many you have, Brian?
[00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:17.160]   My old house six, the new one we haven't put them in yet.
[00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:21.160]   I think I'm up to six or seven now, just everywhere on the property because the doors
[00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:22.920]   all have it.
[00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:28.920]   Does anybody here worry with all of these cameras and also obviously microphones about
[00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:30.560]   privacy and these things being hacked?
[00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:36.040]   What's the worst thing about the skeleton, the Google home and the upcoming Apple terribly
[00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:38.480]   named which we'll go to after the break for sure.
[00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:39.480]   Voice box.
[00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:45.680]   Yeah, you literally have NSA front doors that are sitting in your living rooms, right?
[00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:48.960]   You're trusting that that wake up word means no data is being sent.
[00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:52.840]   But as soon as there's a compromise, all that data, all that voice data gets to go to the
[00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:53.840]   cloud.
[00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:59.120]   Peter, what are the chances that Amazon echoes or Google homes have not been compromised
[00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:01.680]   right now by hackers and or governments?
[00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:03.680]   What are the chances they haven't been?
[00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:04.680]   Those two platforms.
[00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:06.720]   I think it's unlikely that either has been compromised.
[00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:10.680]   I think that I think Amazon and Google have very strong network security.
[00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:15.720]   I think that if you have a random webcam that you purchase on Amazon from a Chinese
[00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:18.840]   OEM for 40 bucks, I think that the...
[00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:19.840]   100%.
[00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:20.840]   I would say that it's pretty strong.
[00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:22.280]   I'm not going to say it's 100%.
[00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:23.280]   Okay.
[00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:24.280]   But there's...
[00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:25.440]   100% chance it's capable of being hacked.
[00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:26.440]   Absolutely.
[00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:27.600]   And I think that there's actually now a number of services.
[00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:31.040]   There are actually boxes you can now connect to your network at home, which will monitor
[00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:34.240]   the traffic from those devices and see.
[00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:38.240]   Is there suddenly a lot of outbound traffic going to some random server in China?
[00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:39.240]   Yeah.
[00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:42.920]   Brian, what are your thoughts on privacy vis-a-vis these new devices?
[00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:47.000]   So Nikki and I disagreed with about this at our old house about inside versus outside
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.040]   cameras, which is firmly against the inside ones.
[00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:51.280]   And I'm like, "Well, what about babysitters and nannies and stuff like that?
[00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:52.280]   Don't you want to know?"
[00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:56.400]   She's like, "I don't want to be spied on because the people who install them and then the people
[00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:59.480]   downstream from that, and then the other thing, like, I just don't trust any of them."
[00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:01.920]   So we ended up with all outdoor cameras, nothing on the inside.
[00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:04.880]   And then every now and then we'd be like, "Damn, I wish we could roll back in that argument
[00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:06.880]   we were just having and show you what you said."
[00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:07.880]   Oh, yeah.
[00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:09.520]   No, I have one argument that way.
[00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:10.520]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:11.520]   Yeah, no, I don't think if...
[00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:12.520]   So we don't have them.
[00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:13.520]   It's good.
[00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:14.520]   Spousal discovery.
[00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:15.520]   Right.
[00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:16.520]   It's a rollback, the argument.
[00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:18.720]   I don't think that that's a productive thing here.
[00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:19.720]   It's not so we have.
[00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:20.720]   We're still together.
[00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:21.720]   Yeah.
[00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:22.720]   All right.
[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:25.960]   When we get back from this very brief pause for the cause, we're going to talk about
[00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:28.480]   Apple's new Siri device.
[00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:37.280]   And if anybody here is going to pay $3,850 or whatever insane price there's only $349 for
[00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:42.280]   a device that's $59,000 from everybody else, we get back on Twitch.
[00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:45.640]   More with this week of Tech coming up in just a moment, but first a word from our sponsor,
[00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:51.720]   the largest independent online financial advisor, Betterment.
[00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:54.160]   Betterment serves one purpose to help you make the most of your money.

[00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:58.120]   No, I'm talking to some of you pretty young.
[00:18:58.120 --> 00:18:59.960]   I was telling my daughter this the other day.
[00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:00.960]   She's 25.
[00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:07.160]   I wish I'd started saving when I was 25 because what I have now would be worth twice as much
[00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:10.640]   with just 10 extra years saving at the beginning.
[00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:15.640]   Start now to build your nest egg, whether it's for retirement, college savings, to buy a
[00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:16.640]   home.

[00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:45.280]   they may be.

[00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:54.520]   job because they monitor your investments more closely.

[00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:04.920]   On the average, Betterment's tax coordinated portfolio can increase portfolio value by as
[00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:06.760]   much as 15% over 30 years.
[00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:08.800]   That's what I mean.

[00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:31.860]   think what your money can do. Hey everybody. Welcome back to this week in tech,
[00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:37.600]   I am your guest host, Jason Callicchannis. And you can buy my book on Amazon super
[00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:43.680]   plug angel go buy the book. They paid me a ton of money to write it, and I'm just totally
[00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:47.640]   scared they're not gonna sound. If I'm Brian, you helped me. I did you were my writing coach,
[00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:52.820]   when we wrote it. It still is! And look at MBA and paper scores.
[00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:57.840]   It's an MBA. It's how to make money angel investing. It's 110,000th the cost of your
[00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:01.820]   MBA MBA. Pretty much. Yeah. I think it's $20 versus $200 million.
[00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:05.680]   Perfect. Hey, Apple released. Oh, thanks for the plug. That's very pretty.
[00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:14.780]   Angel00book.com. Apple released finally a at home smart speaker smart we call them
[00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:18.700]   smart speakers. Yeah, that's a requirement category name smart speakers.
[00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:23.260]   Not sure else. Digital assistant voice digital. I want to call them cloud speakers because
[00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:27.180]   they're connected to the cloud. Let's go with cloud speaker. Okay. We're gonna make
[00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:31.340]   ambient computing device with high end audio. No, I mean, listen, you're the guy who just
[00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:35.580]   rolls off this. Instead of calling it a wand, you call it a jukebox. You already had a mouse.
[00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:39.140]   Technology, you're great at branding. Let's leave it to Peter Rawhouse. Okay. He came up
[00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:45.580]   with the name Gizmodo and I got you as well. That is true. So Apple, which was ahead of
[00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:53.700]   everybody with Siri. They were ahead of everybody with Siri. Finally announces that the WWDC,
[00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:58.220]   that they're going to have a speaker that you can talk to with Siri. Why did it take
[00:22:58.220 --> 00:23:06.860]   them so long, Peter? And why does Siri seem to me to be so far behind? It just doesn't
[00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:11.300]   seem to work as well. Am I right? Because when using them, I, when I use my iPhone,
[00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:16.500]   I feel like Siri is constantly just sending me to the web and it kind of answers my questions.
[00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:22.220]   It doesn't make any sense to me. So they acquired Siri. I was an acquisition. So that
[00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:28.020]   team came into the acquisition. It was a product that was earlier along and Amazon continued
[00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:32.500]   to invest in their voice based assistants and their AI behind, it was powering it and their
[00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:37.780]   speech recognition and Amazon did. Amazon did. Apple became, I think, a little bit complacent.
[00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:41.180]   And then at the same time, Google recognized that this was going to be an important area
[00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:47.460]   and has invested a tremendous amount of resources buying talent, making strategic investments,
[00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:52.460]   strategic acquisitions of other companies, things like that. I think Apple has a lot
[00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:58.260]   of stuff going on and I think that Siri kind of fell by the wayside. And now they're starting
[00:23:58.260 --> 00:24:02.060]   to catch up. Now with the HomePod, it's not going to come out until later this year.
[00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:05.460]   It's a HomePod. Yeah. Terrible name. It's a terrible name.
[00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:09.700]   Steve Jobs would not have let this go through. Just like the iPad. He would have let iPad
[00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:13.100]   go through though. I mean, you can't say he wouldn't let it go through. No, iPad's a
[00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:16.500]   great name. People hate people. No, no, the iPad three. We were talking about the shows
[00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:19.780]   past the hardware of the iPad three. It was terrible hardware that Steve would have never
[00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:23.340]   let ship. I don't think he would have let them name this as well. He would have said,
[00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:27.420]   who came up with that name and then he would have said, who wants that person's job? That
[00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:32.540]   means sort of what he did with like, what was the, what was their iCloud before iCloud?
[00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:36.700]   It was mobile me. Mobile me. And he's like, oh, how is mobile me supposed to work? And
[00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:43.460]   they explained because why the F doesn't it work like that? Why is it not in the movie?
[00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:48.860]   That's got to be the Steve Jobs 2.0 movie. Yeah. But why is it so expensive? This is
[00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:51.740]   the other thing I don't understand. I mean, I know Apple has a premium, but this seems
[00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:56.180]   wildly disproportionately priced compared to Amazon. It's a higher quality speaker than
[00:24:56.180 --> 00:24:59.580]   you're going to get from the Echo or from the Google Home, right? So it's, it's bigger
[00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:04.860]   and has better than a Sonos. So, so the press was there listening to the Sonos play three.
[00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:12.180]   Yeah. And the Amazon Echo and Echo sounded like a AM radio. Sure. And the Apple speaker,
[00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:17.780]   there's a four inch driver mounted centrally for bass. Okay. And then seven tweeters around
[00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:23.780]   it. Okay. And then it listens to its own heartbeat. So it tunes to the space. Ah, so
[00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:28.580]   you mean if the sound behind it, if it's on a bookshelf, if it hits the wall, it knows
[00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:32.020]   don't send so much sound that way. Yeah. That's right. And Sonos actually has that as well,
[00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:34.900]   but you have to run that yourself. You have to walk around the room with your app with
[00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:38.300]   your app on. Yeah. And it will listen to you and you go to every corner. I did that.
[00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:41.860]   I was like, I don't have the time for this. Does it really make that big of a difference?
[00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:45.860]   I didn't know as much of it. I did it once. I did it because it told me. Yeah. There's
[00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:49.980]   been onkyo receivers and receivers for many, many years that would put a microphone in
[00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:53.940]   the middle of your room and it would tune your home theater. Oh. So it does make sense. But
[00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:58.100]   what I found with the True Play, it's not only the pain in the ass factor, but True Play
[00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:01.860]   is the Sonos standard. True Play is from Sonos. And these are all licensed technologies that
[00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:05.740]   companies have been working on in the sound space for years. Right. But I actually found
[00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:10.740]   I lost bass that I had before. So I don't use True Play for that matter. So the reason
[00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:16.180]   it's so much more expensive is that it's really beautiful. Beautiful. And they have the M8 chip
[00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:22.780]   in it, which is the same chip that runs the iPhone 6. Oh, is that Quest really? That Quest
[00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:26.420]   serious bank. So it's basically an iPhone inside there. So it's just like the Apple TV,
[00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:30.820]   the latest generation Apple TV is essentially an iPhone as well with memory and processing
[00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:36.220]   power. I think that they will have a cheaper version down the line. I think that they want
[00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:39.740]   to position this first as I think they want to set expectations around what it's going
[00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:43.580]   to be for audio. And I think it's actually one of the mistakes that they made with Siri
[00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:47.180]   was that when you when they introduce Siri, they positioned as this sort of all knowing
[00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:51.420]   how like a system that can answer your queries and turns out it wasn't that. It was actually
[00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:55.540]   really good at a very narrow set of tasks. And so I think with the HomePod, what they're
[00:26:55.540 --> 00:27:00.940]   trying to do is reposition it, position it as an audio as a, you know, something for
[00:27:00.940 --> 00:27:04.380]   playing music first. Right. So that's a Sonos killer in their mind.
[00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:09.020]   Yeah, the position is a Sonos killer and Sonos is worried as they should be. Right.
[00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:13.820]   And they knew this was coming at some point. Yeah. And I think that the stuff that Apple's
[00:27:13.820 --> 00:27:18.860]   done around Airplay in the past sort of hinted that that something like this was in the works.
[00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:24.500]   Yeah. But they also seem to play nice with Sonos in that they let Sonos be in the store.
[00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:28.700]   You used to be able to buy a Sonos in the store. So now that this is out, do they, is there
[00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:33.980]   a policy to kick Sonos out of the store? I don't think that's happened with some products.
[00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:39.020]   It has happened here and there, but it's never on day one. Yeah. It happens. Ah, I think
[00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:42.420]   there was like the spat with, I think Fitbits were originally sold in the store at some
[00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:45.580]   point. And then they're like, yeah, no more watches. They were the Fitbits were in there.
[00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:49.580]   Yeah. Or no, the up was in there. Oh, yes, that's right. It was the draw bone.
[00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:55.820]   And then fire TV Amazon had a battle with Apple. And now at the latest announcement, they said
[00:27:55.820 --> 00:28:00.060]   that you can now watch Amazon video on Apple TVs now. This is interesting too, because
[00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:06.100]   I talked to somebody from how do I say this without I talked to an interested parties,
[00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:12.660]   I'll say I talked to an interested party. And they said that Apple was demanding that Amazon
[00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:19.060]   Amazon pay them to put them on the Apple TV. And Amazon said, we're not going to pay you
[00:28:19.060 --> 00:28:22.940]   for the privilege of being on there. And they held their ground. Do you think people are
[00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:29.860]   paying to be on the Apple TV? Because people do pay to be in the stores, essentially by
[00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:34.220]   having to give a massive margin to Apple. That's what people don't know. Apple negotiates
[00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:39.300]   with each of those people and makes them pay a very high margin. Is that your understanding
[00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:44.940]   as well? So I mean, it depends. I mean, I'm sure that Apple and HBO, for example, have
[00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:53.420]   some sort of arrangement that gives Apple a slice of maybe that recurring revenue for
[00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:55.820]   subscriptions that are generated from an Apple device.
[00:28:55.820 --> 00:28:56.980]   They get a bounty or something.
[00:28:56.980 --> 00:29:02.260]   Yeah. So that wouldn't surprise me. I had heard something similar around Amazon, you
[00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:07.660]   know, holding firm and refusing to pay. It certainly, there's not a good model. It doesn't
[00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:09.660]   establish a good precedent for Amazon.
[00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:15.060]   It was very, it was dumb, I think, Brian, because when I had the Apple TV and I have Amazon Prime
[00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:19.060]   and all of a sudden Amazon Prime starts having transparent and some other good shows. I think
[00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:22.420]   do they know Netflix is orange is the new black, but transparent was on Amazon. And there
[00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:26.460]   was some good stuff on Amazon. And I was like, okay, now I'm going to go use my Samsung
[00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:29.860]   Smart Hub, which is built in. And then I was thinking about getting the Roku. And I found
[00:29:29.860 --> 00:29:36.180]   myself looking at the Samsung Smart Hub and my family now, they don't turn on the Apple
[00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:39.740]   TV. They use the Samsung one because they just got used to it. It's good enough.
[00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:44.940]   The same thing with my LG, right? And I think that's actually one of the challenges for
[00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:49.580]   a lot of these connected devices, right? Is that all of them have the same services on
[00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:54.460]   them at some point. They all kind of converge. And so if you don't play, if Apple TV, if
[00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:58.660]   Apple blocks popular services from being on their device, it actually makes people not
[00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:01.700]   want to use it. Yeah. They can all play their hand.
[00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:05.540]   Yeah. And if you're asking customers to change inputs on their TV, forget about it.
[00:30:05.540 --> 00:30:09.420]   Yeah. We already did it just with the Apple TV. But it gets really complicated because
[00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:12.860]   we find we're paying for Showtime three different ways. We're paying through the Comcast cable
[00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:16.300]   we have. We're paying for Showtime because we needed it at one point for something we
[00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:20.060]   wanted to watch. And then I think if you buy Hulu every month separately, so this all
[00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:24.100]   our cart stuff just kind of, it's getting really controlled and really complicated because
[00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:28.180]   I think we're paying for, I love Showtime. I'm a court cutter and we have Hulu premium.
[00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:32.860]   I have YouTube red. I have YouTube TV. I have direct TV over the top, direct TV now.
[00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:37.500]   And I just stopped paying for HBO go. So I had six services. Right. We did it back
[00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:42.140]   up to your 200 bucks with the cable company. I got 100 and change. Yeah. And the direct
[00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:48.700]   TV was costing me 200 a month to have all the channels. It's a lot of TV. And then how
[00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:55.060]   much more freeing do you get? Direct TV generally you'd get only rain fade and buffering effectively
[00:30:55.060 --> 00:30:59.260]   through rain fade. But now with I've direct TV now and I'll be watching a show and that
[00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:03.740]   box pinwheel will show up and people take pictures of that and they put it on Twitter
[00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:07.940]   and they offer to sell you a print like here's my and it's gorgeous these patterns but it's
[00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:13.460]   not the show you wanted to watch. Hey speaking of Amazon, which you know I think that this
[00:31:13.460 --> 00:31:19.340]   M&A trend that we're seeing mergers and acquisition is in my mind just the beginning. I think
[00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:24.380]   we're entering an era of big M&A that we haven't seen since time one or AOL. And I
[00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:27.820]   think these are going to start becoming not just $10 billion acquisitions but I think
[00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:32.460]   we're starting to see some maybe $25 billion, $50 billion acquisition, maybe even $100 billion
[00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:38.100]   acquisition as companies like Amazon and Apple start to trend towards a trillion dollar
[00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:45.460]   evaluation. One of those rumors is that Amazon wants to buy slack for $9 billion and that
[00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:51.700]   slack is going to raise $500 million at $5 billion. And that's on the table. That seems
[00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:59.660]   very likely to me. And that slack is at a billion dollar run right now. A billion dollar
[00:31:59.660 --> 00:32:03.620]   run right. Why? It's still not profitable. A billion dollar run right. Yeah that's fine.
[00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:08.900]   I mean who's uninstalling slack once you have it integrated it's impossible to get out with
[00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:12.820]   all the connections. Well that's the beauty of enterprise SaaS businesses right? Once
[00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:16.940]   you get in there it's really hard to switch. Yeah well these and slack specifically has
[00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:21.580]   that massive integration suite where people are putting their Trello or their you know
[00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:28.540]   schedule. It's a new inbox. There's so many things connected. Why does Amazon if they
[00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:33.060]   are in fact interested and it seems like this is where they smoke this fire Peter why do
[00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:37.340]   they want well because they don't do enterprise computing. Why would they do this? It's actually
[00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:44.500]   first of all they have AWS right so they have a very strong tie in to enterprise. But that's
[00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:48.980]   for developers. Well this is a this is a but they also have chime which is lack is for
[00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:52.300]   development which is video conferencing enterprise focused video conferencing they also have an
[00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:57.100]   email service for enterprise which people are not aware of. Yes and so like a mailchimp
[00:32:57.100 --> 00:33:02.620]   Sangeric competitor. Nope they actually have like a like a like a outlook type competitor.
[00:33:02.620 --> 00:33:09.180]   I have no idea. And so unless I'm completely making that up. So they think it's so I so
[00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:16.540]   there is an enterprise kind of stealth enterprise strategy at Amazon where they feel like they
[00:33:16.540 --> 00:33:21.660]   need to be competitive they need to have a service offering you know in this area. And
[00:33:21.660 --> 00:33:27.660]   so they're they I mean Amazon views everyone as its competitor. Apple Google Microsoft
[00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:33.380]   Netflix. Everyone is their competitor. And so and so it is insane. But if you're Jeff Bezos
[00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:41.300]   you see that you don't want to have any point of weakness in your company which is a little
[00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:45.460]   it is crazy. But if you think of from his perspective it's that ever since everyone is
[00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:49.780]   competitor he has to he has to basically play offense with every single market.
[00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:53.020]   Well I'm wondering I think they would spend nine billion on this. Ah because they're going
[00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:57.220]   to be the everything store they are the everything store. I so I look at the companies they they
[00:33:57.220 --> 00:34:02.520]   are I think fourth or fifth in terms of Microsoft Apple Google right in terms of the race to
[00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:08.060]   which really Apple is seven hundred and thirty million. No no Amazon is the top now. Amazon
[00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:12.400]   is really yeah. Mark absolutely. I'm a market cap company right now. Really. They are at
[00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:16.200]   nine hundred eighty. There we go. Okay good. So I was looking at their market cap is four
[00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:22.000]   sixty six right now. Amazon's is four sixty six. Right. Four sixty six billion. Right.
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:27.480]   And Apple Apple is seven market cap. Thirty I think. By the way it's Amazon work mail. Oh
[00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:31.380]   nice. Oh you're right. Amazon seven thirty. That's their outlook competitors. Yeah so most
[00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:35.520]   Amazon's ahead because they have all that cash. The discussion is if you take Amazon
[00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:39.720]   if you take Apple's cash out. Sure then then they would they drop in there. I think they
[00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:43.320]   would be behind the. But anyway. The race to technically be a trillion dollar company.
[00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:46.020]   Right. They're you know fourth fifth on the list. Yeah. But they're on their way. But I
[00:34:46.020 --> 00:34:50.660]   think they could be the first one to get there. Right. Apple's only. Because there's sort
[00:34:50.660 --> 00:34:53.960]   of nothing they can't do. So you look at something like Facebook's in the mix there. They're
[00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:58.280]   number four out of the five. Yeah. And you say could Google build a Facebook killer. And
[00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:01.680]   no they tried with Google plus. Good Apple build a Facebook killer. Can they do social
[00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:06.080]   software. Can they do things. No they've tried that they failed. Could add could Amazon and
[00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:09.720]   you just got to stop and go. I don't know. Like they have a lot of parts they have a
[00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:14.240]   lot of things that maybe they could right. There's nothing that you look at and say could
[00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:19.760]   Amazon do this and you can. Certain be certain and say no they can't do that. So I think
[00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:25.880]   they can kind of do anything. I don't think I also has that. Massive iPhone franchise
[00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:33.200]   which to me feels like it's reaching the peak. And I phone eight. You know I phone seven
[00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:37.280]   was slightly better. I phone eight will be slightly better. But they really haven't
[00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:43.680]   established a huge second money printing machine is that a risk factor you think. So the Apple
[00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:49.720]   TV was supposed to be this right and the watch watch. Yeah. So that's true. But for VR goggles
[00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:54.640]   so they are they are they are. They will be interesting. They didn't talk about hardware
[00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:59.640]   for it but they did have the Oculus plugged into an I Mac and they have the multi core
[00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:05.960]   or 16 core I Mac that was announced. The I Mac Pro. I Mac Pro. This to me seems like
[00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:13.000]   the stupidest misread of their past most passionate users. The most passionate users
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:20.160]   are going crazy that they can't put in the latest and video card and swap out RAM easily.
[00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:24.560]   So what do they do? Instead of giving them an I Mac tower like little you could give
[00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:29.160]   those super fancy I Mac tower that was two towers ago with just the new hardware in it
[00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:36.440]   instead of doing that. They make an I Mac that's five thousand dollars where you can't
[00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:40.400]   change anything. I mean what a horrible investment. Everything's soldered on but they say that
[00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:44.960]   no one is building computers anymore. And remember the last computer they innovated
[00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:50.040]   with look like a trash can. I was the pro. It was beautiful but it was a mistake because
[00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:54.200]   you didn't swap the stuff out. Peter why did they make the I Mac Pro. Is this are they
[00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:58.760]   clueless to what their super fans want the creative because I'm hearing creatives now
[00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:05.280]   want to move on and are buying Windows machines for this reason and the if software is all
[00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:11.040]   cloud based what's the difference between using you know premier or Photoshop or whatever
[00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:17.640]   you use as a creative on Mac or PC I don't think it's that big of a. I think for now
[00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:21.640]   having a local GPU makes a big difference for a lot of that stuff. I think we're. No no
[00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:25.440]   no my point is is the is the Mac version any different from the Windows version and could
[00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:31.120]   you move over pretty easily. I think that I think that some developers are moving over
[00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:36.080]   and finding that for the things they want to do having the flexibility to put in you know
[00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:40.840]   a 1080 TI or something like that into their machine makes a new video. Yeah which is amazing
[00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:45.200]   is that two thousand dollars at seven hundred I paid seven hundred for my. It's amazing.
[00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:49.760]   It's worth every penny. And what does it allow you to do just the the resolution and
[00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:54.160]   the frame rate and everything. So I can run the Witcher three at four K it's like one
[00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:59.760]   of the high end you know games at four K resolution sixty frames per second. So it just looks
[00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:04.160]   ridiculous. It looks amazing. And you can swap out your monitor whenever you want. Right.
[00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:07.560]   So you can you can disconnect the investment in the monitor from the investment in the
[00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:11.280]   computer. Well yeah that's exactly I mean I built my own PC because I wanted something
[00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:17.120]   for VR right. And so you know what. You know building you're going to always pay less than
[00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:22.280]   buying. What's the premium. It's literally double to buy a Mac right. For five thousand
[00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:25.520]   dollars what you get from the iMac Pro for five thousand. They marketed though as your
[00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:31.240]   cost. You're saving because the screen's built out. Yeah. Instead of thousand dollar delta.
[00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:36.000]   I mean I would say that if you were going to go and buy a super high quality five K
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:40.400]   display which is what the iMac Pro comes with. You're probably I mean that would probably
[00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:45.440]   cost what thousand dollars fifteen hundred bucks on its own. Yeah I have the LG it's gorgeous.
[00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:50.520]   Yeah how much was that. I think it's six or seven hundred five K one. No I have the I
[00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:53.960]   don't have the five K one. So the five K I think is like slowly a thousand or something.
[00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:57.200]   I'd have to double check. You spent three thousand plus a thousand so it's only a thousand more
[00:38:57.200 --> 00:39:03.120]   to get the iMac. But I do I mean I do think that there is there there is a certain class
[00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:07.480]   of developer which is that wants. They don't want to they need something that feels future
[00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:11.520]   proof. In the sense that like okay next year when a video comes out of the new card I can
[00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:17.840]   just swap in the next one. And that certainly I would never consider buying a high end machine
[00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:23.320]   that I couldn't swap out new components when when they're available. Hmm. Okay let's talk
[00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:28.400]   a little bit about the chances of these AR glasses. Brian you're I know you have Oculus
[00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:34.760]   and Vive right. Just the Vive. Just the Vive. Kids love it. Yep. What do you think the chances
[00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:41.000]   are Apple comes out with these VR the AR glasses. So the next year to. Because they came out
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:47.560]   with the AR kit right and people are doing iPad videos now right. No no so so it's enabled
[00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:50.320]   the software let people get in there let them start building the apps and then you know
[00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:54.520]   now it's all the hardware. I think they have to do it. I think so listening to everybody
[00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:57.880]   here talk about Apple products. No not this year. I don't think they're anywhere near
[00:39:57.880 --> 00:40:00.680]   it. I think if they tease the software but don't tell you about a product like they're
[00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:05.160]   telling about the speaker then it's not coming anytime soon. So I think it's on the road map.
[00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:09.520]   I think that could be a great thing for them by the time VR is hitting there in it or AR
[00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:13.880]   is hitting there in it. But I was just listing out different products. I'm just not I have
[00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:17.840]   an Apple laptop. I don't want to upgrade it. I would seriously consider Windows. Yeah
[00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:21.680]   I just have to surface. It's incredible. You know I was I was lumping in the home pod
[00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:25.600]   with Siri which is just not exciting right. You have to train Siri to do things you have
[00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:29.400]   to really think through what am I going to tell Siri to send an email or a text right
[00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:33.520]   now. I've never had to feel like that with an Alexa and I just lump in with maps on the
[00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:38.440]   watch just like not exciting products not really well done products and so right. So
[00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:41.840]   the AR maybe that's the thing that comes out next where you say okay they didn't do a
[00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:45.520]   TV didn't do a car they didn't do this. Maybe AR is going to be the next big thing so I'm
[00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:49.720]   excited for them. But you know I'm just I'm holding my breath will wait we'll see.
[00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:53.760]   Yeah they're nowhere near what a Microsoft student with HoloLens. Correct. HoloLens
[00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:58.160]   product or whatever you know like pick a company. When is the HoloLens going to become
[00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:01.240]   a consumer product because they're on the are they on the second developer care just
[00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:04.720]   to the first. They're on the first they killed the second one and now they killed the second
[00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:07.760]   one. Yeah well they didn't. Is that going to skip a great two. They're going to skip
[00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:12.400]   a generation go. Well not necessarily they're still focused on the enterprise component
[00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:15.320]   the enterprise market for this. And I think for Microsoft it actually makes a lot of
[00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:19.000]   sense because they haven't. I think they're conceding that maybe they're not going to
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:24.800]   win on consumer because they don't have mobile. Right. Or any you know not anymore. What are
[00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:31.160]   what's the enterprise AR play. There's tons. I mean let's talk about. There's industrial
[00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:35.680]   right which is you work in a factory or you're doing repairs or something like that. You can
[00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:40.320]   actually have a schematic of the thing you're working on right in front of you. And it can
[00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:46.000]   walk you step by step exactly. You know go to tweak this and can actually you know in
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:50.520]   real time tell you need to turn that another order. Don't cross the wires. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:55.600]   So that's what I think medical is another. They actually are you know surgeons are starting
[00:41:55.600 --> 00:42:00.200]   to use AR to be able to if they're doing you know laparoscopy and sort of surgery inside
[00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:03.760]   the body to be able to actually have a better idea of what they're actually doing. And then
[00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:11.200]   I think anything related to building architecture being able to you know walk into a building
[00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:16.440]   site and be able to see exactly. Construction or even interior decorating you put these
[00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:20.920]   on. Yeah. Sort of see what you're supposed to do. So I think those are the carpet. Yeah.
[00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:24.080]   And so I think those are three of the or if let's say you need to repair a building.
[00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:28.600]   You can walk around and see okay what's behind those walls. Fascinating when you think about
[00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:36.120]   surgery if you were a medic in the field or you were in some you know region that didn't
[00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:41.160]   have a hospital close to you and somebody needs to have their appendix taken out. A local
[00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:45.120]   doctor was never done it could put these glasses on and if they know how to use basic
[00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:50.140]   surgical techniques they could literally walk through an obscure thing or like alien
[00:42:50.140 --> 00:42:55.400]   covenant where she gives herself. Sure. No, no. I think you're an optimist. I think
[00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:58.520]   there's think of your Uber driver the ones that like know where the hell are going and
[00:42:58.520 --> 00:43:00.960]   the ones that have their nose in the GPS and they like don't know where they're going
[00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:04.760]   and circle the block a few times right. Don't do the GPS right. I don't want one of those
[00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:09.400]   ones doing my surgery. I want one of these. So you know. But your choice might be you
[00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:13.760]   know the hollow lens assisted surgeon or. Oh no. Right. Right. Yes. I would know. I'm
[00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:19.560]   sorry. Spoiler alert in aliens. Spoiler alert. The aliens win. I mean I think I think the
[00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:24.600]   aliens killed the humans. Spoiler alert. Small. They had better AR headsets. So I've been
[00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:31.160]   saw a PTSD post traumatic stress disorder AR embodiment as well. So it doesn't even
[00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:35.600]   have to be medical invasive. It could be medical mental as well which is really cool.
[00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:40.840]   All right. When we get back from this commercial break let's talk a little bit about. Twitters
[00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:47.920]   new redesign and if anybody cares as well as the fact that they took my feature. My
[00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:51.760]   snowflake feature and they've incorporated into Twitter more on the snowflake Twitter
[00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:56.560]   feature when we get back on this weekend. I'm really we'll be back with a show in a
[00:43:56.560 --> 00:44:01.280]   minute but I had to come back and tell you about my vacation. Actually no. Leo report
[00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:05.480]   here. It's not about my vacation but I am really thrilled that before I left on vacation

[00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:25.120]   blogging in the early 2000s and went to wordpress pretty much at the beginning before of wordpress
[00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:30.640]   before you know I mean when it was just getting started. I ran I hosted it myself for years
[00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:37.680]   almost a decade. So I know wordpress inside and out and then you know now I'm on wordpress.com

[00:47:09.040 --> 00:47:15.600]   incredible CMS content management system I use it for calcans.com hey twitter redesign this week
[00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:22.640]   and um it looks fresh it looks clean but not much has changed does anybody care
[00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:27.200]   did anybody notice anything I was telling my kids about it in the car I was explaining
[00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:31.920]   people's frustrations with twitter right because they know I use twitter and I said if you ask
[00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:34.640]   everybody what are they what are they like the two top things you want to fix on twitter like
[00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:39.440]   number one harassment number two is like edit my tweets and so every single time they come up with
[00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:43.280]   a new feature a redesign is something it was like thanks I want all my tweets edited and you gave
[00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:47.120]   me this right I want my harassment gone and the redesigns on the web page not the mobile app
[00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:51.440]   no no mobile app it's it's a bit the mobile the the iphone mobile app now looks more like the
[00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:54.880]   android ones they've standardized it a bit they've they've cleaned it up across all of them they
[00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:58.320]   still actually I tell you a weird thing is the lists are out of order so I constantly add people
[00:47:58.320 --> 00:48:01.680]   to like private lists of stuff I'm looking at and it's in a different order on the desktop
[00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:06.160]   right but you get to the iphone quicker you slide to the left list is right there correct no it
[00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:10.800]   takes two clicks instead of like seven clicks so when I explain to them how frustrating twitter is
[00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:16.480]   to the users uh my middle kid he goes oh this is just like pokemon go every single thing we ask
[00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:20.800]   them to do they don't do they take years and then they give you a thing and it wasn't what you wanted
[00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:24.080]   and then they cut off all the third party apps that show you where all the pokemon are
[00:48:24.080 --> 00:48:28.160]   it's like my god that is twitter that's exactly what twitter did so that's their their twitter is
[00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:34.240]   pokemon go uh peter you're you use twitter every day uh huh oh yeah i check any difference to you
[00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:39.360]   you care i went back to tweet bot right i mean i use tweet bot i why would you like better about
[00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:45.520]   tweet bot you know it just it feels slightly more power user i guess uh and um any specific
[00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:52.480]   feature you love uh so i i think that um i just find the ui to be more intuitive and less kind of
[00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:56.880]   clutter twitter open i would just let any even with the new ui it's not do whatever they want it
[00:48:56.880 --> 00:49:01.360]   wasn't that the strength of twitter is that they kind of just let people you know a thousand
[00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:06.880]   different flowers bloom so there is a path not taken right which is so twitter they hit a cross
[00:49:06.880 --> 00:49:10.880]   towards i can't this was maybe like seven years ago where they had a path which is either to be
[00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:17.200]   essentially a metered api business right or an advertising driven business and if they were
[00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:21.280]   going to be an ad driven business they had to kill the third party eco developer ecosystem because
[00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:26.480]   so they could control the uh where all the ads are served right uh with all these third party
[00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:30.720]   clients uh like tweet deck yeah uh and remember there was a company that was going to acquire
[00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:36.560]   that was acquiring all these third party clients right and uh and they uh had an offer to buy tweet
[00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:41.440]   deck twitter realized because tweet deck had so much of this traffic that they couldn't do this
[00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:44.560]   and actually the plan for this other company which i can't remember what it is right now it's one of
[00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:49.280]   the guys from um ideal at build grosses company right one of his companies they were going to
[00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:55.040]   basically take all these third party clients and then introduce their own ad network no twitter
[00:49:55.040 --> 00:49:58.960]   like protocol is twitter was going down all the time right and they were going to introduce it as
[00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:02.560]   here's a backup protocol so when twitter goes down you can still get a message as long as you're
[00:50:02.560 --> 00:50:06.560]   on one of these clients right and then eventually they were going to try to ween people away right
[00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:10.880]   twitter entirely it was kind of gangster like how they were trying to like didn't work didn't work
[00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:15.760]   because is there room for somebody to create a twitter 2.0 since twitter can't seem to get out of
[00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:20.880]   their way no no but try not you know i think that people are too entrenched it's it look i mean
[00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:27.200]   are you a mastodon right right i i create an account i you know set up i i didn't set up my own
[00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:30.800]   instance but if people aren't familiar with mastodon but it's essentially like an open source
[00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:34.880]   federated version of twitter where everybody can set up their own server right and so like having
[00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:39.760]   minecraft servers or or email frankly or bit torrent whatever it's an open standard nobody can
[00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:44.880]   control it and the the different instances you know they can decide their own rules for what they
[00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:51.440]   accept in terms of speech and and federating to other sort of other instances and it's gotten a
[00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:55.280]   little bit of traction i think it maybe has like four or five hundred thousand users but it isn't
[00:50:55.280 --> 00:51:02.560]   growing that quickly but um it it you know it would be it has some of the um the nice things
[00:51:02.560 --> 00:51:06.240]   about early days which were very open developers can create their own experiences around and
[00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:10.320]   things like that i would love to see somebody create a b corporation which is a benefit corporation
[00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:18.160]   not quite a nonprofit but not a marauding company to create literally a clone of instagram facebook
[00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:25.920]   and twitter literal clones that were uh that had ads to support them but that were made to be privacy
[00:51:25.920 --> 00:51:31.680]   first and consumer first right and literally just copy facebook because facebook has no problem
[00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:37.280]   copying everybody else right it sounds like a job for rocket internet well yeah they're the
[00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:44.240]   original photocopiers but i'm just more for people who want to have control of their data over time
[00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:51.040]   and maybe not have an ad based experience basically if if apple had their own social network what
[00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:57.040]   would it be like they wouldn't be probably usable but we what's that barely usable probably usable
[00:51:57.040 --> 00:52:00.880]   because they added social to music and that was what pang didn't work pang didn't work well
[00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:06.400]   though that was such a good idea so remember it remember app dot remember app dot net yes um i had
[00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:10.400]   i paid for it i paid for it too but they had the wrong model which was they should not have charged
[00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:15.520]   the users they should have charged the developers right and it should have been for the first 10,000
[00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:20.560]   50,000 calls to the api free of course after that you pay but you want to put ads on your client you
[00:52:20.560 --> 00:52:25.040]   don't want ads on your client whatever you want to do yeah and if twitter had taken that strategy and
[00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:28.880]   said here's what we're going to be we're not going to be an ad platform because actually competing
[00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:34.240]   against facebook and google at scale is unless you're at their scale is very difficult um they own
[00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:40.640]   the online ad ad uh ad businesses but if you had said look we're going to be this infrastructure
[00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:46.640]   play so to speak and developers can just pay us by the pound for api calls uh i think twitter would
[00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:53.520]   have a probably a much more defensible and successful business so last august i wrote a blog post for
[00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:58.640]   recode on evolving twitter a message from our ceo of the folks in the control want to
[00:52:58.640 --> 00:53:03.200]   pull it up for the people watching evolving twitter a message from our ceo on recode.com
[00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:09.360]   and um i wrote this because jack was getting in the middle of a debate between lezley jones
[00:53:09.360 --> 00:53:16.480]   the hilarious woman from sadnetlives and ghostbusters and ghostbusters was terrible the reboot was
[00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:24.160]   horrible and so milo yinopolis who is the big troll from the right starts telling her she's
[00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:30.000]   horrible and calls her all kinds of very inappropriate names and jack gets into the middle of it
[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:37.200]   uh even though twitter has all these tools to block people and i said you know why don't they
[00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:42.400]   just if somebody has a lot of complaints or they say something vulgar right you could you would
[00:53:42.400 --> 00:53:46.560]   know if they say some one of the inappropriate words and you would know if they've gotten a
[00:53:46.560 --> 00:53:50.400]   lot of warnings against them right because you can report people why don't you just blur those
[00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:56.000]   people's tweets out by default and say click here to see the rest of the comments they may include
[00:53:56.000 --> 00:54:00.160]   inappropriate things and then people could turn that off in their settings if they want the
[00:54:00.160 --> 00:54:05.920]   unfiltered and they're part of the free speech camp as opposed to the snowflake safe space please
[00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:10.880]   don't hurt me with your words camp like uh and sure enough i don't know if you guys noticed
[00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:15.680]   um and uh would be interested if you noticed have you started to notice that replies
[00:54:15.680 --> 00:54:21.600]   sometimes they're blurred out exactly as i designed i asked somebody on twitter to design it
[00:54:21.600 --> 00:54:26.880]   and they like you know five people just put up different versions of how to blur it and um
[00:54:26.880 --> 00:54:32.720]   now when you use twitter if somebody says something that's a little bit charged
[00:54:32.720 --> 00:54:37.280]   like the word idiot or something like that it seems to be blurring those responses
[00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:42.640]   so i've seen it i've seen it with um i've seen it when you click into some photos and things
[00:54:42.640 --> 00:54:46.400]   like that it'll it's a really weird just poorly implemented right but you'll see you'll see on
[00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:52.000]   your phone a full screen uh hardcore porn photo and then at the bottom it won't show you the text
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:56.080]   of the tweet because it says this tweet i had that exact thing happened to me like but wait i
[00:54:56.080 --> 00:54:59.120]   i'm seeing the whole thing right here but at the bottom you're not going to show me the link or
[00:54:59.120 --> 00:55:02.560]   whatever it was like right they showed the image but not the cock they're like this tweet they
[00:55:02.560 --> 00:55:08.400]   implemented yeah so it says by that time it's too late yeah because under if you read trump's tweets
[00:55:08.400 --> 00:55:14.480]   there's a new thing yeah that's occurred and i did this myself to test it um people because
[00:55:14.480 --> 00:55:19.600]   trump gets so much activity on his tweets everybody reads them that you can hijack his tweets with
[00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:23.760]   funny stuff underneath them yeah and as a verified user with a lot of people i guess i get ranked
[00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:28.000]   a little bit higher so i just put is trump gonna get impeached yes or no i got like 5,000 people
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:33.920]   voted on the survey so you can now you can do replies and surveys and so people are starting
[00:55:33.920 --> 00:55:38.320]   to do that people are figuring that out too if two verified people start having a conversation
[00:55:38.320 --> 00:55:41.760]   under a particular post oh right that ranks right at the top you get two verified once
[00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:45.680]   we're back and forth you're verified right yeah Dave you're not of course right no no i'm not
[00:55:45.680 --> 00:55:49.600]   a vast and they're like i'll get you brian yeah please i don't want the guy with the q can i don't
[00:55:49.600 --> 00:55:53.920]   need to be verified and the best thing this should have won though that instead of verified it should
[00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:58.880]   be more like infamous don't you think like you have one for me like an infamous tag like i
[00:55:58.880 --> 00:56:02.960]   love to be categorized with him thanks for that no but trump is the best thing that happened to
[00:56:02.960 --> 00:56:07.760]   twitter let's just really oh i don't know if twitter feels that way but to the rest of the world
[00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:12.560]   twitter is losing relevance there was only that's true us people at the table tweeting to each other
[00:56:12.560 --> 00:56:16.160]   so face it has brought even happened to trump and trump's the best thing that happened to twitter
[00:56:16.160 --> 00:56:20.720]   there's a triangle there it's pretty interesting i like it it is true well here here's the um
[00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:29.360]   well let me ask this question should there was a movement um ln pow from uh so that read it she
[00:56:29.360 --> 00:56:33.600]   was that read it right that didn't last too long and now she's with uh kapore capital she's a partner
[00:56:33.600 --> 00:56:39.360]   over there but previously obviously she had done a sexual harassment lawsuit with clonald perkins
[00:56:39.360 --> 00:56:44.800]   that she lost um but it seemed like she did obviously experience some very significant harassment
[00:56:44.800 --> 00:56:50.240]   but she lost the case so i don't think she she may have lost the case but clearly she was harassed
[00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:54.320]   in my mind i'll put that out there no and it was it was a big visibility thing that didn't exist
[00:56:54.320 --> 00:56:58.640]   before right so i mean i think she's trying to find that way she she's kind of she did lose so
[00:56:58.640 --> 00:57:02.400]   i don't think it was cut and dry but there was definitely harassment that occurred so i think she
[00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:09.600]   in a way is vindicated um but uh she wrote a whole blog post about how they should delete trump's account
[00:57:09.600 --> 00:57:16.800]   do you guys think that trump's account should be deleted if he is doing harassing other people and
[00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:19.520]   this kind of stuff because he clearly has over his life
[00:57:19.520 --> 00:57:26.240]   harassed people that is no different than milo yinopolis and i don't want to be the arbiter of free
[00:57:26.240 --> 00:57:31.920]   speech here but when he you call somebody a pig like he's called people somebody that or do you think
[00:57:31.920 --> 00:57:37.520]   gosh if you he's the president i say if you ban him that just creates chaos and you you kind of want
[00:57:37.520 --> 00:57:42.800]   this guy to be tweeting what what are your thoughts on it could could you could they possibly ban the
[00:57:42.800 --> 00:57:46.960]   president off of twitter i i don't think they can i mean you would yeah you would you ban your biggest
[00:57:46.960 --> 00:57:51.280]   user from your service right well that's a pragmatic reason but i'm also thinking so so
[00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:55.440]   facebook actually has this too where um where they had the whole thing where they there is a um
[00:57:55.440 --> 00:58:00.000]   that photo from vietnam of the naked girl yeah they're famous iconic and they deleted it saying
[00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:04.960]   it's it's you know it child pornography right in some news like you know what there's a news
[00:58:04.960 --> 00:58:10.480]   worthiness to this that sort of transcends maybe other you know right terms of service kind of
[00:58:10.480 --> 00:58:14.240]   concerns about the content right and so i think that that was probably maybe the best argument
[00:58:14.240 --> 00:58:19.360]   around donald trump which is you know even though he pushes some boundaries right um we have no choice
[00:58:19.360 --> 00:58:24.800]   that things that might be not allowed for a more anonymous user right maybe don't apply in this
[00:58:24.800 --> 00:58:30.080]   case because there's a newsworthiness to the content right but the legislature just said that we because
[00:58:30.080 --> 00:58:36.000]   he's tweeting so much we're going to add twitter to the public archives to make sure that things
[00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:42.240]   aren't lost because he would delete tweets and he's well there's a lot there there are laws
[00:58:42.240 --> 00:58:46.560]   around public records um you know governmental records retention and things like that that
[00:58:46.560 --> 00:58:50.640]   um and i just want to point out that we did get 57 minutes into the program before saying the
[00:58:50.640 --> 00:58:54.400]   word trump i think we deserve a little bit of a golf club for that it was it was it was pretty
[00:58:54.400 --> 00:59:00.000]   bigger competition here is the undercurrent this is the one thing i was hearing amongst industry
[00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:05.200]   people and i don't want to sound like a conspiracy theorist but i'm gonna i'm gonna float for you
[00:59:05.200 --> 00:59:11.120]   what was floated for me in a group discussion amongst people who are extremely respected
[00:59:11.120 --> 00:59:18.400]   okay and then yes the chat room can take a drink because we did mention trump and i did
[00:59:18.400 --> 00:59:22.800]   mention inside connections and information okay but i haven't name dropped anybody yet um do you
[00:59:22.800 --> 00:59:28.560]   hear about this in your tesla i was actually on a phone call my tesla drank holy what yeah but i
[00:59:28.560 --> 00:59:33.600]   was in the i was in the model that's not the x got it oh so you have two but i was in serial number one
[00:59:33.600 --> 00:59:37.840]   okay good now everybody's now the chat room can all drink nice they're just plastered they just
[00:59:37.840 --> 00:59:45.200]   collapsed yeah here's the crazy this is the crazy theory is it theory ever okay we all saw
[00:59:45.200 --> 00:59:50.960]   zuckerberg going out and saying i'm going to meet everybody in 50 states tractor and he like
[00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:55.520]   shows up at people's houses very weird right like what why is he doing this he's got a company to run
[00:59:55.520 --> 01:00:00.800]   is he gonna run for president or whatever and i said you know what i don't think that he's running
[01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:04.800]   for pre i mean he might run for some office of course he talked about it secretly with
[01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:09.840]   mark andries and that came out in a lawsuit or a shareholder lawsuit because he wanted to take two
[01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:14.160]   years off or something and mark andries and was trying to figure out how to finagle that with his
[01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:23.280]   um board but it turns out there was this company the analytical company kimber's analytics that had
[01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:28.320]   said a large yeah it's very well known that a large amount of money went into that company
[01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:33.200]   to buy ads on facebook right as somebody pointed out facebook verifies every ad
[01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:38.560]   if you want to place an ad there's somebody who looks at the ad they will never as this person
[01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:43.040]   pointed out to me ever allow you to put an affiliate link in there's against the terms of service
[01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:46.880]   if you put too much text i've seen this happen on an image they don't let you put text on images
[01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:50.640]   because they can't read it baked in right it's baked in so therefore they don't let you do that
[01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:55.360]   so there's like massive filters i've seen maybe 10 or 20 percent of the ads we do at launch for
[01:00:55.360 --> 01:01:00.400]   launch bus whatever get kicked back okay so they're verifying the ads trumps buying the ads
[01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:07.040]   now this is where the theory gets interesting they know that they're doing ads that are targeted
[01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:14.720]   to the people not to get people to vote to vote for trump they know they're not going to get people
[01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:18.720]   to vote for trump it's very hard to get people to switch but there was a group of people who came
[01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:24.000]   out to vote for obama who hadn't previously voted in elections right it was massive turn out obama
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:29.600]   had the best turn out ever those people were targeted so yeah they yeah this is this is known
[01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:38.640]   yeah so they used facebook to target those people those people are african-american in some cases
[01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:44.400]   and in these specific state so there was a big controversy that facebook was allowing targeting
[01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:52.080]   people by race yeah and the color of their skin so now you have zuckerberg potentially having to
[01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:58.640]   explain how he allowed the platform let fake news now you had fake news to it a lot of these ads
[01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:03.440]   were fake news so they were putting fake news on to get people to not vote for hilly who were from
[01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:09.120]   certain demographics okay this is a really bad picture now there's an investigation occurring
[01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:16.720]   the investigation is going to be asked doing discovery the facebook has not released the ads
[01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:23.920]   that they approved the ads are going to come out what did the ads say nobody knows except for facebook
[01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:27.760]   and the people who did it then you add another layer and this is where it becomes totally insane
[01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:35.200]   what if the russians were stealing the names of these people and broke into the voter registration
[01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:41.440]   logs there is a rumor yeah i'd heard that's going around that the way the russians were able to help
[01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:46.800]   where that they had the list of the voters they had the democrats list of the voters because they
[01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:53.840]   hacked the dnc right well and they're yeah and that's why they're trying to um get into uh local voting
[01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:59.840]   servers so they weren't trying to switch the technology in the voting but they were able to
[01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:04.640]   hack in and get lists of voters they got the list of voters they got them to kambrin
[01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:12.160]   kambrich kambrich analytica they got facebook to run fake news ads in this theory facebook approved
[01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:17.760]   the ads facebook got people to not show up so you're all going to come out because of the
[01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:22.880]   crazy investigation going on now the others you know he's interviewing um what's the impasse
[01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:27.440]   pass quality like the passway like the digital director the digital director came up with his
[01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:31.520]   last name passquade or something like that and then here's where it gets totally crazy you said you
[01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:36.400]   were going to lay a conspiracy theory i'm waiting for that keep well no i mean this last piece of
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:43.840]   what did facebook know so if you're zuckerberg you know this is all coming out so how bad is it
[01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:50.240]   for zuckerberg if it comes out that the russians stole list targeted people and facebook was the
[01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:55.440]   tool in which fake news was approved by them to change it if it was in fact hacked and then
[01:03:55.440 --> 01:04:03.040]   they made a reported 100 to 200 million dollars off these ads so facebook profited
[01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:09.040]   in t in rush and it could be rush of money that's the piece that's it but i don't think i mean i
[01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:13.920]   don't think facebook could be held responsible for this it's what they're built to do i mean this
[01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:18.080]   is like you're using facebook to do what facebook is built to do and i think there's actually probably
[01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:22.480]   more sinister crazy stuff going on at facebook that they're listening to our phones all these other
[01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:27.600]   things right that could be even bigger than that well they are in the messenger app using location
[01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:32.240]   services they're putting ibeacons they're mailing them out to restaurants to put in their store these
[01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:37.280]   restaurateurs have no idea what an ibeacon is look it in and what are you talking about what is facebook
[01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:41.040]   doing now it sounds good there's plenty of bluetooth beacons bluetooth beacons the reason we talked
[01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:45.680]   about this on the show before the reason why the facebook app and the messenger app are separated
[01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:49.920]   because people had push notifications turned off for facebook so they got a second swing at the
[01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:56.480]   back second swing and then they put in the ibeacon technology in that so i've literally had friends
[01:04:56.480 --> 01:05:03.680]   walk out of stores and those ads start showing up wow so this um this micro targeting minority
[01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:09.440]   report is happening on your phone it's also about closing the loop on on click attribution right so
[01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:13.600]   if you click on an ad and then they can store they can charge you twice as much they could
[01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:17.120]   probably charge you again they could probably charge you once for the click and once if the
[01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:22.000]   person comes to the store so you could pay by visit instead of pay by click yeah the other piece of
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:27.840]   this is zuckerberg's initial reaction to that fake news or anything could sway an election was
[01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:32.640]   that's preposterous and then he quickly fell back on that because you can't say that facebook
[01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:37.120]   right and in your in your deck for the advertisers you're like we can sway elections and then publicly
[01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:41.360]   you're like well i don't think we sway the election so i i can play the jason's game also so i was at a
[01:05:41.360 --> 01:05:47.440]   very exclusive event just after the election shrink sharryl sandberg was there speaking in a tesla and
[01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:53.200]   she wrote it in a tesla did i drop you off of my tesla and um and so uh and people were asking her
[01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:59.440]   you know what the f*ck sorry oh god wait um but people actually did say that i know i know i'm
[01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:03.200]   sorry i apologize um frack frack i usually don't swear that much but but people did actually say
[01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:08.080]   that to her they were like people were angry at her at her that's my point about and zuckerberg
[01:06:08.080 --> 01:06:11.840]   being on the road and so it's a redemption and so people said if you have all this data if facebook
[01:06:11.840 --> 01:06:16.560]   so good at data how did you let this happen how did you not see this and she said we were blind to it
[01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:20.640]   and they she said we all thought hiller was going to win so we didn't take this problem seriously
[01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:25.920]   ah so that's the reason yes so it's not that they didn't see it they said well this is getting
[01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:28.800]   really interesting they said we're getting paid and it's not going to matter getting paid and
[01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:34.000]   doesn't matter exactly never in their mindset we take two hundred million dollars they were targeting
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:39.200]   people with fake news who cares we just got the money yeah which makes total sense when you think
[01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:43.520]   about a facebook is a money grab that you don't know if you're not to get too far out of field but a
[01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:47.440]   lot of people's behavior is best explained i mean why did komi do what he did he thought hiller is
[01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:51.040]   going to win so he thought you know what hiller is going to win i need to preserve the reputation of
[01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:55.200]   the fbi because it's going to come out that i if i withheld information and same thing with the
[01:06:55.200 --> 01:06:59.680]   bomb it goes back to obama did inability to poll so because the polls couldn't pick up on this because
[01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:03.920]   people would not say that we're going to vote for trump when i know what actually actually if you
[01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:09.440]   read nate silver the polls were actually pretty accurate and and shows that hiller one by about
[01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:13.680]   the margins she was expected to win by right that what they couldn't pick up on was some of the
[01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:19.760]   slight stuff in the swing states uh but it was just too the signal was too minute well and it's also
[01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:23.760]   harder to polls uh these smaller the harder to pull the states that there's not there was not
[01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:28.480]   necessarily a lot of good polling in swing states what are the chances knowing what we know because i
[01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:32.880]   want to keep this tech base to not make it a political show but knowing what we know about hacking
[01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:40.400]   what are the chances that other countries dave no much more than we do
[01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:48.240]   about what occurred in you know we have all these other countries are able to spy just as well as
[01:07:48.240 --> 01:07:53.280]   we are and perhaps even better because they have access i guess to the european side of
[01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:59.840]   the transatlantic cables and and satellites and whatever what are the chances are that one of those
[01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:07.360]   foreign countries germany comes to mind or the french uh that they have information that would be
[01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:12.960]   that was hacked or that would be pertinent yeah so this is just like the tour networks the onion
[01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:18.960]   router yeah it's supposedly secure but it was designed by the fbi or ci it was designed by nerds
[01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:24.000]   but then the cia and nsa created the endpoints and if you control the endpoints if you're that
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:28.560]   fiber link if you're that connection going to the real world then you can monitor all the
[01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:33.840]   traffic going in and out of the tour that's why everything is vulnerable and look at visio tv's
[01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:38.560]   they had software it was running on the tv to show which programs you're watching and not just tv
[01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:43.600]   shows over the air what streaming services you're watching as well so anything with an internet
[01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:48.240]   connectivity now has the ability for a two-way communication back to the server think about all
[01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:55.520]   the webcam takeovers that have happened as well so um the iot backlash that we're going to see
[01:08:55.520 --> 01:09:00.480]   is going to be uh pretty interesting in the next few years what should we do peter about
[01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:09.920]   specifically voting because we now know the russians we're specifically trying to hack into
[01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:16.240]   specific machines and or locations is this correct and what should we do as a country in
[01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:22.720]   terms of thinking about voting because we do have this wonderful uh you know because we're uh a
[01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:27.840]   united states of america where fifty states i guess every state has their own and then even
[01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:32.160]   locations have their own processes yeah so it's kind of hard to hack the whole thing there's no
[01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:38.320]   central point of failure yeah uh what should we do well uh so i think that we need to make sure
[01:09:38.320 --> 01:09:43.440]   that we have paper backups paper ballots right so that we can actually do a hand manual recount of
[01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:48.480]   votes and i and i think that we should also make sure that the companies which are producing these
[01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:52.960]   voting machines that they have software that we can understand and can be auditable i would put
[01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:56.800]   someone like Bruce snire and chart i would create an electoral not going to happen under this
[01:09:56.800 --> 01:10:02.480]   administration he's one of the the best security experts in the world uh you know i would point
[01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:08.000]   like oh he's the guy who has the uh website that got the denial of service attack yeah that massive
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:11.840]   there uh and so i would take a guy like that i would say you know what you tell us you're a
[01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:17.120]   blue urban commission and set up best practices you know make sure that we solve this problem it is
[01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:21.920]   since it's a state-by-state and locality by locality uh this thing it's tough for the federal
[01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:27.520]   government to sort of mandate each state is frankly in charge of its own uh elections um there aren't
[01:10:27.520 --> 01:10:30.960]   there isn't i mean even though there's a federal election commission it's not in charge of
[01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:35.120]   mandating how each individual state conducts its votes that's why we have all these different
[01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:40.080]   machines and all these different uh ways of voting a few years ago i went to Estonia in my uber drone
[01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:45.520]   and um okay i flew down a real plane but really real plane but uh this is talking about the
[01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:49.200]   flying cars yeah the flying carning yeah but Estonia let's talk about that in a minute
[01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:55.280]   they've gone to a chip based system for everything it's one id it's your atm it's your taxes
[01:10:55.280 --> 01:11:01.040]   it's your water bill huh your driver's license so like the new chip in our your credit cards
[01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:07.040]   so it's a very similar technology challenge and response russia which Estonia used to be a
[01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:13.280]   block country from russia russia d-o-s the country and shut down that system so think about this now
[01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:18.240]   you can't get money out of the atm you can't pay our taxes so they had to literally cut their
[01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:24.160]   ties to the internet from a whole country so as much as i want the future to be this uh the state
[01:11:24.160 --> 01:11:29.200]   of challenging responses and keys and encryption um peters right this paperback you can imagine
[01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:32.720]   right a fail way on election day and you're sorry we don't know who it looks like there's
[01:11:32.720 --> 01:11:38.000]   another thing it's gonna something that we sooner or later we're gonna have a presidential election
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:43.200]   that goes down there's gonna be some and there's there's gonna be something that happens whether
[01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:49.120]   it's uh some credible uh instance of hacking or some sort of technical failure or something
[01:11:49.120 --> 01:11:52.640]   that happens that calls the legitimacy of the qua the election into question it calls the
[01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:57.200]   legitimacy into question that might not be the next election might be but sooner or later
[01:11:57.200 --> 01:12:01.200]   it's going to happen and it's going to be a huge issue and so better to get ahead of it now
[01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:07.040]   and we're not doing anything about it in fact you know trump doesn't want to even talk about
[01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:10.160]   there being any sort of issue with the last election because he's worried it calls
[01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:14.160]   the legitimacy of his victory into question right and so it's particularly challenging yeah so he's
[01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:20.400]   not gonna address it well i just want to put in my vote for next election let's kind of vote for
[01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:24.720]   bloomberg and sandberg okay go ahead i voted for twenty i think there's gonna be a race to see
[01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:30.320]   whether our elections turn into like a blockchain based election or voting on facebook so those two
[01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:34.320]   things are gonna like which one's gonna happen first right yeah blockchain all right when we get
[01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:40.640]   back facebook is now uh has an an emergency check in service that's a little bit controversial
[01:12:40.640 --> 01:12:46.400]   when we get back on this weekend tech may i uh may i step in for a moment just to mention
[01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:52.800]   some a brand that's very closely associated with me because they've been an advertiser for a very
[01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:56.640]   very long time in fact i think they they've been with a radio show since the beginning
[01:12:56.640 --> 01:13:02.640]   which is like more than ten years carbonite dot com i just uh talked to the data carbonites
[01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:08.160]   founder david friend love david he's now an old friend and i just reminds me
[01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:17.280]   how deeply the engineers of carbonite understand cloud backup not only they've been doing it longer
[01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:22.560]   they have a deep understanding to the point where they're writing their own software for writing to
[01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:28.640]   the disc this is a really sophisticated operation but i don't say that very often because really
[01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:33.920]   the thing that's great about carbonite is you don't have to worry about it all all that
[01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:40.240]   sophistication is hidden it is easy go to carbonite dot com that got plans for home and office
[01:13:40.240 --> 01:13:49.360]   that what it is is automatic cloud backup backup to their servers and it's for emergencies is for
[01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:55.200]   you know a your be your business burns down right imagine what would happen if all your backups
[01:13:55.200 --> 01:14:00.640]   all your computers burnt down you would be out of business uh you people
[01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:06.560]   so many of you don't back up and i know that the ones who do back up because they lost data you
[01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:13.760]   don't have to lose data to become a backup fanatic and carbonite does it right you pay once a year
[01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:19.280]   flat rate it's easy it's very affordable and it's one of those things you set it and forget it and
[01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:23.920]   they just take care of the rest and by the way they've got plans of all for all different kinds
[01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:28.560]   of people all different kinds of business for mac for pc for home for office their business
[01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:35.280]   solutions arrange from everything from a uh you know just software you run on one pc to software
[01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:41.520]   that supports servers to their evolt their hardware on premises hardware backup then backs
[01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:46.080]   up to carbonite that's actually a great solution and if you're worried about ransomware carbonite
[01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:52.000]   is the solution you don't have to worry about want to cry and ransomware because carbonite keeps

[01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:37.760]   Ah yes welcome back to this week in tech. I am your guest host Leo Laport is on a beach somewhere
[01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:42.640]   drinking a peanut colada. I hope uh thanks uh Leo for allowing me to do this it's always an honor
[01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:49.600]   and a privilege to be here in Petaluma with Peter Rojas, Dave Matthews and Brian Alvey.
[01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:54.480]   This week we saw in a very professional crew i might add this is really behind the scenes
[01:15:54.480 --> 01:16:03.840]   series very tight AV everything very tight production. This week back to Facebook if you were in the
[01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:14.080]   location as i understand it of a tragedy like we had this uh skyscraper fire in London i'm not
[01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:20.720]   sure the name of the grand fell grand felled is this horrible tragedy which seems like it's
[01:16:20.720 --> 01:16:27.440]   could have been avoided putting that aside at if you were in the vicinity Facebook then says hey
[01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:34.160]   please check in on top of that if you don't check in in your in the area and the people were saying
[01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:38.480]   that they were way far out of the green fell area yeah like they might have been like nowhere near
[01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:43.840]   it a mile away or whatever uh 58 people have died wow that's according to the chat room here
[01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:48.080]   that's just horrific you might probably gonna go up well because they don't they haven't been able
[01:16:48.080 --> 01:16:50.960]   to get in the building it's not my understanding i think they're still going through it i mean
[01:16:50.960 --> 01:16:54.960]   they still have to yeah verify and there are people that are still missing that are having
[01:16:54.960 --> 01:16:58.240]   time for how do we not have the technology to stop these kind of things they will put that aside for
[01:16:58.240 --> 01:17:04.880]   a second um Facebook i mean it's nice that Facebook wants to make sure everybody's okay but here's the
[01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:12.160]   thing that people are criticizing them for as Facebook is apt to do you have no choice but to check
[01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:18.880]   in or you are listed as not accounted for bram what do you think of this approach that if you were
[01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:25.840]   not accounted for you're unaccounted for i mean it seems like unnecessarily forcing people to use
[01:17:25.840 --> 01:17:32.320]   Facebook it seems heavy-handed and it also seems like you're oh it seems overreaching in a way is
[01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:36.080]   there intent so it seems like it is i was i don't know what there i mean our intent is we own the
[01:17:36.080 --> 01:17:40.640]   planet and everybody's on our service right therefore it's the universal check-in right um so there's
[01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:45.760]   that i don't like that it's you know opt out versus opt in and you haven't told me yet why they say
[01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:48.640]   that this is the reason they're doing it but i would think that they would say well if you died
[01:17:48.640 --> 01:17:52.960]   in the fire you wouldn't be able to check in therefore we have to list you as missing but if
[01:17:52.960 --> 01:17:57.520]   you're safe then you can totally check in so let's make it this way so the people who survive
[01:17:57.520 --> 01:18:00.880]   something or aren't in some problem can actually use the product because obviously you can use your
[01:18:00.880 --> 01:18:04.480]   phone so reminds me how the group functionality worked when they first set up groups you can add
[01:18:04.480 --> 01:18:09.680]   anybody to a group so the second they started the group here all the chatter they put myself
[01:18:09.680 --> 01:18:14.480]   my garington and mark suckerberg in a fake group called namblah which was like a petafile group and
[01:18:14.480 --> 01:18:17.600]   they called it like petafile group and they put a thoroughness in there and then it became a
[01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:23.680]   decorant story is this them overreaching again peter is is this how you would design the product
[01:18:23.680 --> 01:18:28.480]   or do you think they have a case to be made if you think there's a case to be made that hey listen
[01:18:28.480 --> 01:18:33.840]   this these kind of tragedies occur very infrequently it's in everybody's best interest for everybody to
[01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:41.200]   check in so i'm by no means a facebook apologist i closed my facebook account seven years ago i
[01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:48.160]   know i went back crazy uh but i i think that it's something where there isn't necessarily and uh
[01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:52.720]   there's sort of a bit of damned if they do damned if they don't right okay if it's explained if it's
[01:18:52.720 --> 01:18:58.880]   opt-in if somebody has to have the foresight to opt in to something like this um when there and
[01:18:58.880 --> 01:19:03.840]   then when there's an emergency uh then it only alert will list them as missing if they don't
[01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:08.160]   happen to check in this thing doesn't really work because then you don't know who is who is had
[01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:14.480]   who is already opted in who hasn't i would say that also facebook again these sorts of
[01:19:14.480 --> 01:19:18.880]   disasters or emergencies are so infrequent that it's not necessarily going to do very much to
[01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:23.760]   raise their engagement numbers overall at least i should hope that there aren't enough of these
[01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:29.360]   emergencies and disasters and certainly facebook is not lacking for engaged users at this point
[01:19:29.360 --> 01:19:34.160]   anyway so i hate not to be i i don't understand i want to take too cynical of an approach to it
[01:19:34.160 --> 01:19:39.040]   i mean they don't have to offer so maybe any sort of service like this at all right so maybe it's
[01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:43.120]   just based on their past behavior you kind of always think they're overreaching and making these
[01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:48.960]   things just a little too totally but i but i i in this case i mean i don't want to overthink it well
[01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:53.280]   i like peter's point which is that this is a this is a thing in your app that you're seeing some piece
[01:19:53.280 --> 01:19:56.800]   of news some thing in your newsfeed that you can't run ads against
[01:19:56.800 --> 01:20:01.360]   right if you run ads against it looks really bad why are they doing it yeah but they also just
[01:20:01.360 --> 01:20:06.240]   added a feature where you'll be able to donate to the red cross now this is very interesting yeah so
[01:20:06.240 --> 01:20:13.120]   they'll attach to a tragedy so if they're i mean in this will include terrorism i would take it or
[01:20:13.120 --> 01:20:19.600]   a tsunami or a fire or an earthquake when you check in that you're safe from a nearby disaster you
[01:20:19.600 --> 01:20:24.560]   have the option to share and donate to a registered nonprofit related to the incident who picks
[01:20:24.560 --> 01:20:29.360]   the nonprofit because that would be like very controversial something happens in hady remember
[01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:34.000]   in hady you had a bunch of people set up their own nonprofits and then they were hiring all of
[01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:38.800]   their it was a bit controversial one of the musicians i can't remember why cajon i don't want
[01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:42.720]   to say because i don't know the deet i can't remember the i'm not sure i'm not sure let's pour
[01:20:42.720 --> 01:20:49.120]   white clef if if white clef did imbezzle money share money and if you didn't we
[01:20:49.120 --> 01:20:54.160]   we apologize somebody was involved in some shenanigans in taking money for hady and then
[01:20:54.160 --> 01:20:59.280]   hiring their family and whatnot but in this case who we get to pick does it mention dave
[01:20:59.280 --> 01:21:04.720]   if there was a tragedy they became the red cross or they're picking you know america for hady or
[01:21:04.720 --> 01:21:09.120]   something it just says in the coming weeks it'll it'll be up there and to prevent people from
[01:21:09.120 --> 01:21:13.200]   abusing the feature of facebook spokesperson said that a team of human moderators would
[01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:17.680]   manually interview or review each fundraiser well this is a big issue with go fund me now right
[01:21:17.680 --> 01:21:23.680]   where there is this u_p_s_ shooting in uh... in septus go home as a asset and people are
[01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:29.040]   setting up fake go fund me campaigns supposedly to benefit the families of the of the victim so
[01:21:29.040 --> 01:21:33.760]   so i know the woman who runs go fraud me and so if you follow go fraud me on twitter or if you
[01:21:33.760 --> 01:21:36.560]   use really to a a drain uh... i think it's a
[01:21:36.560 --> 01:21:40.000]   uh... i hope i got that right but uh... and she's friends with facebook friends among
[01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:44.560]   journalist people uh... it's fantastic so she started out with there was a a go fund me
[01:21:44.560 --> 01:21:47.520]   and she kept bringing it to their attention bring it to their attention please can you
[01:21:47.520 --> 01:21:50.560]   take this off it's a scam they you know it happens all the time there's a
[01:21:50.560 --> 01:21:53.920]   accident on the highway somebody you know somebody's mom dies take the pictures they can
[01:21:53.920 --> 01:21:58.160]   go fund me and collect three grand from from all the elementary schools and all the friends and
[01:21:58.160 --> 01:22:02.960]   churches nearby and take the money and leave wow so there's so much of that it's a it's a big piece
[01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:07.200]   of and they don't verify this i i don't know what they do i think the fun to do
[01:22:07.200 --> 01:22:10.640]   it's don't they need to know your bank account get your credit get your driver's
[01:22:10.640 --> 01:22:14.400]   service has this reputation that they have and no other service has no funding
[01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:20.320]   pretty low bar right there they and that's how they've grown right is they've had a low bar
[01:22:20.320 --> 01:22:24.880]   ah and um if they had really high standards the service wouldn't be as successful as it is
[01:22:24.880 --> 01:22:29.920]   hmm all right let's take a final break and let's see what's what happened this week there was
[01:22:29.920 --> 01:22:34.000]   so much that happened on the twit network let's see what happened on the twit network
[01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:40.080]   previously on twit brian one of the things that uh we have to watch out for because we're geeks
[01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:46.480]   is exposure this is the wind stereo pop-up tent unclip it and then you just go oh i want a house
[01:22:46.480 --> 01:22:54.720]   boom boom and that's what you got this week in law kiss and frankly a variety of rock bands
[01:22:54.720 --> 01:23:00.960]   over the last several decades have used the devil horn sign i guess some debate whether
[01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:06.000]   the thumb should be out or not gene simmons has filed a trademark application to trademark that
[01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:10.880]   claiming that he came up with it on his own i think the court can take judicial notice of the
[01:23:10.880 --> 01:23:16.560]   fact that ronnie james dio invented the devil horns i think there's prior art here this week
[01:23:16.560 --> 01:23:22.000]   in enterprise tech this is actually an interesting one and a bit scary for any person who wears or
[01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:27.120]   it needs modern day medical devices after reviewing seven pacemaker products from
[01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:32.080]   different vendors they were able to find 10 security vulnerabilities that most of them shared
[01:23:32.080 --> 01:23:35.840]   and then also found that from the components that they're actually made up of included
[01:23:35.840 --> 01:23:41.440]   8600 security flaws they're concentrate on the medicine which god bless them that's what they
[01:23:41.440 --> 01:23:48.080]   really should be but they really and truly need to bring in security specialists as part of the
[01:23:48.080 --> 01:23:52.640]   design process to it making the world safe for technology
[01:23:52.640 --> 01:23:59.120]   and what an amazing week it was of the twit network let's see what's going to happen next week
[01:23:59.120 --> 01:24:05.440]   it's been a few weeks since the one plus five was announced and this week we will hear more
[01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:11.360]   details about the android phone with a snapdragon 835 processor and a rumored dual camera setup on
[01:24:11.360 --> 01:24:17.040]   the back if the leaks are to be believed if you are a heavy user of facebook groups
[01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:23.520]   you might be interested in the first ever facebook community summit on june 22nd and 23rd in chicago
[01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:28.560]   admins will gather and share in real life hopefully giving each other a lot of thumbs up

[01:24:46.480 --> 01:24:53.040]   will be covering this week on tech news today every monday through friday at 4 p.m pacific see you there
[01:24:53.040 --> 01:25:00.240]   wow it's going to be an exciting week i cannot wait to see what's happening at vidcon with all the
[01:25:00.240 --> 01:25:06.720]   youtube stars it's a little bit of madness over at youtube right now because a lot of the stars i was
[01:25:06.720 --> 01:25:13.120]   watching one of them um who is super critical of youtube right now because they keep turning off
[01:25:13.120 --> 01:25:18.800]   monetization on his ads right um he's the guy who starts every video with you beautiful bastards
[01:25:18.800 --> 01:25:23.600]   how you doing beautiful bastards that the phillip de franco phillip de franco oh look at that
[01:25:23.600 --> 01:25:29.440]   i'm there you go hey get that guy you're a millennial now phillip de franco how you doing
[01:25:29.440 --> 01:25:35.040]   you beautiful bastards and anyway phillip de franco is like really going him and he's basically that's
[01:25:35.040 --> 01:25:41.600]   that's hard as as you can imagine and um he is really upset because they keep turning off every
[01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:46.480]   time he talks about the news they turn off monetization because they don't want to have ads on news
[01:25:46.480 --> 01:25:50.480]   stories like the fire we were talking about or you know any just any news story they don't
[01:25:50.480 --> 01:25:57.600]   trust this but then cnn he pointed out we had tons of ads on there so obviously they have a
[01:25:57.600 --> 01:26:04.640]   double standard and he is actually now going with the patreon kind of route of and he's doing it
[01:26:04.640 --> 01:26:09.520]   direct where people pay him directly and then he's doing videos off of youtube everybody seems to
[01:26:09.520 --> 01:26:14.320]   be a little bit upset it seems like a couple years ago this since since came through as well
[01:26:14.320 --> 01:26:19.600]   right it's yeah it just seems they at a certain point you get too big for youtube but youtube
[01:26:19.600 --> 01:26:25.600]   specifically now has had to say um yeah i think we got a show title you beautiful bastards um
[01:26:25.600 --> 01:26:30.960]   specifically now youtube is turning off the monetization on a lot of ads i think it's even
[01:26:30.960 --> 01:26:35.120]   after under ten thousand it's just a harder game to play didn't you do a blog post on this yeah the
[01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:40.560]   years ago i was why i just said to myself i don't i mean just that they're exerting too much control
[01:26:40.560 --> 01:26:47.680]   over it um to make it worth anybody's time uh also this week e3 or wait wait e3 is next week or
[01:26:47.680 --> 01:26:51.840]   it just happened it just happened and now e3 i went to the first one years and years and years
[01:26:51.840 --> 01:26:56.400]   ago and they launched the first playstation and that's the gaming show by the way it's the gaming
[01:26:56.400 --> 01:27:02.720]   show e3 my understanding is it used to be only trade then it became like trade but everybody kind
[01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:07.040]   of snuck in yeah and then they said no we're going back to trade yeah and then this year they said
[01:27:07.040 --> 01:27:11.520]   let's make a comic con is that right where they're led at like 15 000 people in one day or something
[01:27:11.520 --> 01:27:15.920]   crazy they're they're opening it back i actually went the one year where they um split it up and
[01:27:15.920 --> 01:27:20.320]   put it in like in a hanger in Santa Monica and made it really small and they made it a trade show
[01:27:20.320 --> 01:27:25.680]   remember that it was pretty bad it was terrible yeah but there were uh but they're still like you
[01:27:25.680 --> 01:27:30.800]   know what's great is it it's still an event where the big players make big announcements i mean the
[01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:36.560]   then i thought the announcement of the xbox one x which the name i don't necessarily love but i
[01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:42.480]   want to keep that brand of xbox one yeah no i i get that it's uh it's a it's a little um
[01:27:42.480 --> 01:27:49.680]   oh the x was cost a little clunky was it cost-reduced that so so they dropped the price on the uh the
[01:27:49.680 --> 01:27:56.560]   xbox one s i believe or their original xbox one whichever it is but the xbox one x is what was called
[01:27:56.560 --> 01:28:04.800]   um project Scorpio and so this will be their high end 4k ready uh box which i think is going to launch
[01:28:04.800 --> 01:28:12.080]   in November at for 500 bucks and um this is the new xbox the new one that's good yeah and so it'll
[01:28:12.080 --> 01:28:17.040]   be backwards compatible so you can play existing xbox one and i think even um xbox 360 we're
[01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:24.800]   are they calling it again xbox one x i know so it was xbox one now it's one x yeah xbox still the best
[01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:31.360]   selling console right so actually the playstation 4 was was beating the xbox one in this generation
[01:28:31.360 --> 01:28:35.840]   it was was doing young people still want these devices or do you think it's going to go back to
[01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:40.400]   pc based games because of the headsets or do you think they're gonna the headsets will actually win
[01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:44.880]   with the consoles well so so obviously the ps4 has playstation vr right then uh microsoft actually
[01:28:44.880 --> 01:28:51.040]   said very little about vr at this uh with relation to the xbox one x but they do have
[01:28:51.680 --> 01:28:56.960]   microsoft is introducing or microsoft's oem partners are introducing vr headsets later this year
[01:28:56.960 --> 01:29:02.640]   like novo and um i think ace or how the third parties will put they haven't confirmed but the
[01:29:02.640 --> 01:29:06.800]   speculation is that these these third party headsets will people want that do the console people want
[01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:12.240]   that or do they just want to play like the most amazing what is it overcast that i was playing or
[01:29:12.240 --> 01:29:18.000]   whatever that one is uh well uh there's uh overwatch overwatch overwatch thank you for
[01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:21.840]   somebody's laughing they're like what is this guy over watch right overwatch is the big one yeah
[01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:26.960]   but they really want vr they just wanted the next overwatch i think it's both um and really i mean
[01:29:26.960 --> 01:29:30.480]   different gamers want different things right i mean i think you know gaming is so big now that
[01:29:30.480 --> 01:29:35.040]   it's hard to sort of cast everyone with one you know paid everyone with one brush um i tend to be
[01:29:35.040 --> 01:29:40.000]   more vr focused on my gaming but uh there's certainly uh like i was saying earlier there are certain
[01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:44.880]   games that you can play in 4k which just look amazing and if red dead redemption 2 doesn't come out
[01:29:45.600 --> 01:29:51.840]   for pc i'll definitely buy an xbox one x to play it in 4k the the ps4 vr is pretty amazing and the
[01:29:51.840 --> 01:29:58.080]   controller shows up in the space glowing you don't see your hands but uh they really did a nice job
[01:29:58.080 --> 01:30:03.360]   with the integration of gameplay with the vr better than any other uh experience i think yeah
[01:30:03.360 --> 01:30:10.480]   and skyroom skyroom for vr yeah which uh which is coming i am particularly excited because celebrating
[01:30:10.480 --> 01:30:16.960]   the 20th anniversary of age of empires which was a game i loved in my 20s to play it like crazy
[01:30:16.960 --> 01:30:21.840]   the real-time strategy in age of empires is coming back they've remastered it and supposedly
[01:30:21.840 --> 01:30:26.160]   bill gates had something to do with it in a red and a m a he said hey we got to bring this back
[01:30:26.160 --> 01:30:30.240]   people love it so they're doing age of empires a definitive edition and they remastered all the
[01:30:30.240 --> 01:30:36.480]   visuals in 4k and they did this incredible video where they show the original game and then they
[01:30:36.480 --> 01:30:43.200]   show like this incredible 4k where you can zoom in and it is it looks just amazing compared to
[01:30:43.200 --> 01:30:47.280]   where it was at but um is this going to be a trend where you think like some of these games
[01:30:47.280 --> 01:30:51.360]   are going to come back in the same way we have they have to do ghostbusters again they got to
[01:30:51.360 --> 01:30:55.200]   reboot everything yeah they can just reboot every video game now bro of course they're yeah it's
[01:30:55.200 --> 01:31:00.400]   uh it's no different than you know well you said ghostbusters but uh no they bring everything back
[01:31:00.400 --> 01:31:05.040]   why not yeah right if if you now have the money to buy all that stuff you couldn't buy when you're
[01:31:05.040 --> 01:31:09.680]   a kid right and they can charge you a fortune for it and you should buy a rig for it you know go to
[01:31:09.680 --> 01:31:16.720]   town interesting i'm wondering uh at what age peter we both have kids uh and then you have kids a
[01:31:16.720 --> 01:31:20.800]   little bit older both my kids doing both my sons do over watch and vr and they split between the two
[01:31:20.800 --> 01:31:25.440]   and they fight over the pc we have what age is the right age to introduce kids to video games and
[01:31:25.440 --> 01:31:30.240]   then what are the rules so what are you thinking about for your boys peter are they allowed to play
[01:31:30.240 --> 01:31:34.640]   games a little bit um and how do you approach that because they have kids who are playing
[01:31:35.040 --> 01:31:41.760]   minecraft at home for 10 hours a day right they're contemporaries so i've convinced my kids who
[01:31:41.760 --> 01:31:46.160]   they're four and eight that um it's more fun to watch me play than to play them so i'm not kidding
[01:31:46.160 --> 01:31:51.920]   actually it's it's amazing incredibly sinister wow so unbelievably they're like yeah they're like
[01:31:51.920 --> 01:31:56.000]   let's can we play legend zelda i'm like yeah so they sit and watch and play legend zelda really if
[01:31:56.000 --> 01:32:00.320]   they watch people on youtube play for 10 hours they might as well watch that right this is inspired
[01:32:00.320 --> 01:32:03.680]   yeah no they they're giving me tips they're like you know go to that shrine and something like that
[01:32:03.680 --> 01:32:07.120]   parker i'm going to i'm just being to one of the young people who has parker i'm going to
[01:32:07.120 --> 01:32:11.040]   introduce my daughter she i'm gonna let her know that eating ice cream is better when she watches
[01:32:11.040 --> 01:32:16.320]   me eat ice cream much better experience to watch me eat ice cream than to have her actually eat
[01:32:16.320 --> 01:32:22.080]   the ice cream brown what is your approach to video games with your kids now because we all grew up
[01:32:22.080 --> 01:32:27.520]   in the atari generation and our parents didn't know what to think it was kind of like uh who drew
[01:32:27.520 --> 01:32:31.280]   to them they were a little concerned are you concerned about and how do you manage the number
[01:32:31.280 --> 01:32:35.840]   of hours because this stuff is designed now when we played it it was they would just barely got
[01:32:35.840 --> 01:32:39.760]   the games out and they barely worked right but now they're designed to be addictive right they've
[01:32:39.760 --> 01:32:44.400]   added gamification to a level that's different than just can you get to the top of donkey gong
[01:32:44.400 --> 01:32:48.800]   it's it's addicting with the badges and the in the gold and the coins and all the stuff how do you
[01:32:48.800 --> 01:32:52.640]   handle it no so we have strict rule in our house is um you can't play video games or watch youtube
[01:32:52.640 --> 01:32:57.040]   while you sleep or when you shower or when you swimming in the pool other than that so if there's
[01:32:57.040 --> 01:33:02.240]   one or one day that's it no we really we don't limit them much i mean we want them to eat with us
[01:33:02.240 --> 01:33:05.520]   and okay not be any so when they're eating they can i don't have any concern with them building
[01:33:05.520 --> 01:33:09.360]   stuff in minecraft what they're downloading showing each other stuff working together on
[01:33:09.360 --> 01:33:13.760]   things i'm telling me brine there was a water problem near technology because yeah did something
[01:33:13.760 --> 01:33:18.000]   drop the fire in the pool yeah they're telling me somebody took the oculus riff in the pool i think
[01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:21.200]   the kids are figuring out there's got to be a way we can play while we're in it yeah i think they so
[01:33:21.200 --> 01:33:26.000]   when you got the oculus riff that they they said oculus skiffed and they thought that's a podium thing
[01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:32.480]   hey oh no it's a dad joke sorry we don't we don't stop them i mean we uh you know what about
[01:33:32.480 --> 01:33:40.080]   having the devices be monitor out and in a in a family room as opposed to privately using devices
[01:33:40.080 --> 01:33:45.280]   because this is another thing i'm a little bit concerned with uh with the devices at school because
[01:33:45.280 --> 01:33:51.680]   in my daughter's last school kids were in the playground they would let grades k through six
[01:33:51.680 --> 01:33:56.960]   or maybe even eight or k-2-6 would be have recessed together and i just thought well this is crazy
[01:33:56.960 --> 01:34:00.000]   because whatever the five and six year olds are looking on their phones because they the
[01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:03.200]   five fifth and six graders have on their phones which they started to get phones right oh my god
[01:34:03.200 --> 01:34:06.880]   they're gonna just start showing things on their phone and phone is open to everything so we lucked
[01:34:06.880 --> 01:34:12.880]   out which is that we only have the one like you know alienware vr ready viv pc in the house so
[01:34:12.880 --> 01:34:16.720]   they fight over that each kid has like a you know two thousand dollar mac and they hate me because
[01:34:16.720 --> 01:34:20.960]   we only have one windows machine in the house right so they fight over that so but it's in a central
[01:34:20.960 --> 01:34:25.520]   room and it happens to be a screen and we can see what they're looking at all day long so that's
[01:34:25.520 --> 01:34:28.880]   actually i've never thought about it we didn't design it that way but they're forced to sit at
[01:34:28.880 --> 01:34:32.720]   a card table in our like living room about phones or something that are you get i was talking to one
[01:34:32.720 --> 01:34:39.920]   parent who told me they have an app on the phone that everything on the phone is recorded yeah we
[01:34:39.920 --> 01:34:43.520]   haven't done that Peter what are you thoughts when you introduce a phone to the mix
[01:34:43.520 --> 01:34:50.080]   are you going to be trust but verify or verify and don't worry about trust i'm not sure yet i mean
[01:34:50.080 --> 01:34:56.560]   because your kids are going to google this video uh find out my main you know my older son has you
[01:34:56.560 --> 01:35:00.880]   know his youtube videos do quite well uh but i know he's got some cooking videos yeah and
[01:35:00.880 --> 01:35:07.920]   i mean he's in a school that doesn't allow any sort of screens or devices at all uh at the school
[01:35:07.920 --> 01:35:11.920]   but they also strongly discourage it at home as well and it's actually kind of nice so the kids are
[01:35:11.920 --> 01:35:17.520]   are not um it's not a big part of their lives um obviously they they see it and they've obviously
[01:35:17.520 --> 01:35:22.240]   watch me play video games sometimes and things like that but um i'm not sure when i would introduce
[01:35:22.240 --> 01:35:26.480]   fun i may have an eight-year-old is the oldest one he's got to be talking about it you know he
[01:35:26.480 --> 01:35:33.440]   has not he's not really that focused on it um to be honest i i don't think um i think that we think
[01:35:33.440 --> 01:35:37.360]   that that they're obsessed with it because we're obsessed with them but um at least for my kids
[01:35:37.360 --> 01:35:41.520]   like they're not they don't spend a lot of time like demanding a phone or arguing about a phone
[01:35:41.520 --> 01:35:46.480]   getting a phone dave i would ask you about your kids but you would have to be able to
[01:35:46.480 --> 01:35:50.960]   find someone to love me exactly and i know you're single i know where you were going with that i was
[01:35:50.960 --> 01:35:55.600]   just you know well put i don't want to make you feel bad no no but but when i when i have children i
[01:35:55.600 --> 01:36:01.840]   do want children but when i do they'll have full um google contacts retinal uh VR maybe the
[01:36:01.840 --> 01:36:08.000]   matrix in the back we'll let them have uh the wetware yeah i'll have the brain computer yeah i'll do
[01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:12.320]   the nsa's not gonna be the real discussion met uh lawn must mesh yeah i mean that's gonna be the
[01:36:12.320 --> 01:36:15.920]   real discussion is like your kids are gonna come and say hey can i get like oh yeah air pods i don't

[01:42:50.800 --> 01:42:57.520]   and she laughed at you uh she's very cross she yeah i can tell that this is like i mean it's one thing
[01:42:57.520 --> 01:43:03.200]   to drink beer all day and watch like back-to-back football games is a whole number thing to be in
[01:43:03.200 --> 01:43:07.840]   a star fleet battle when your kids need to like do their math homework yeah no i usually play
[01:43:07.840 --> 01:43:11.440]   after they go to bed so i don't have that level of guilt but you do really feel like you're in the
[01:43:11.440 --> 01:43:15.840]   same i mean you're you know i'll be sitting here and the captain will be you know behind and you look
[01:43:15.840 --> 01:43:19.600]   back and you see the other player you see an avatar of the other person and it maps your hand
[01:43:19.600 --> 01:43:23.760]   movements and stuff like that it's it's very immersive can you play ensign crushers or an
[01:43:23.760 --> 01:43:29.040]   ensign in this can we add a fifth uh you know it's just getting a short end it's just for right now
[01:43:29.040 --> 01:43:33.840]   they gotta get will we and then there in fact i think will we and should just basically they
[01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:38.800]   should just pay him specifically to be our for 12 hours a day i would watch him if you played
[01:43:38.800 --> 01:43:42.640]   it on twitch i know i'm sure it's like yeah what are we i mean i think we could get will we
[01:43:42.640 --> 01:43:48.400]   and for what like 20 50 bucks an hour i would say well i think he's more excited than that
[01:43:48.400 --> 01:43:52.880]   credit if i made the software i would literally pay will we can to be there they should pay the
[01:43:52.880 --> 01:43:57.920]   cast members so they actually did they did a promo video where they got um i think they got
[01:43:57.920 --> 01:44:03.040]   levar Burton he's totally and i can't remember who else but he's available but they got members
[01:44:03.040 --> 01:44:06.480]   of the crew i think he's doing levar Burton i think he's doing like voicemail messages right now he'll
[01:44:06.480 --> 01:44:11.120]   do vr he's doing like a reading rainbow reading rainbow kickstarter rebooting yeah
[01:44:11.120 --> 01:44:14.560]   yeah i like it love our is cool but this is actually really interesting
[01:44:14.560 --> 01:44:19.680]   think about like people do celebrity appearances that's a big star trek then we're just talking
[01:44:19.680 --> 01:44:24.880]   about what's the parody film the galaxy quest oh my god galaxy just just watched it a week ago i
[01:44:24.880 --> 01:44:27.680]   i've seen that film like three or four times it gets better every time so good but they could
[01:44:27.680 --> 01:44:34.800]   literally do a vr where you go and play with what would what would those treckies
[01:44:34.800 --> 01:44:41.600]   pay to literally be there with will we eat and levar Burton oh people would pay totally i mean
[01:44:41.600 --> 01:44:45.280]   but what would they think i think the answer is anything i think they would pay a thousand
[01:44:45.280 --> 01:44:49.200]   dollars i don't know about thousand dollars to play for two hours with them you don't need to
[01:44:49.200 --> 01:44:53.680]   have everybody play you just get like two or three people you record it syndicated yeah it's like
[01:44:53.680 --> 01:44:57.200]   these guys who go to rock and roll camp you know what rock and roll camp is guys like
[01:44:57.200 --> 01:45:03.840]   whatever people in like whatever hair metal they will you pay five dollars you get to be in
[01:45:03.840 --> 01:45:08.880]   if you get to play with like the third base player from sticks or like not even like the original
[01:45:08.880 --> 01:45:12.480]   family related news i'm going on tour with the original members of dire straights this summer
[01:45:12.480 --> 01:45:18.240]   what is your favorite gadget uh a wand is an easy so it's the to be determined whether or not i'll
[01:45:18.240 --> 01:45:22.880]   use this a lot this summer but i i got it i'm holding up the amazon wand amazon wand we'll see if that's
[01:45:22.880 --> 01:45:27.280]   good i'm going to be testing that i'll be talking about it on my social media channels but um
[01:45:27.280 --> 01:45:31.840]   personally i got a boosted board which is the explain what it is to people that version two
[01:45:31.840 --> 01:45:37.360]   the skateboard came out um i have a tesla dream but not a wallet that will support that
[01:45:37.360 --> 01:45:41.040]   or three tesla's how many do you have now Jason three let's not talk about it i mean i'm i'm gonna
[01:45:41.040 --> 01:45:46.080]   run for mayor mayor Jason dot com and i i gotta be a man of the people yeah so um the boosted board
[01:45:46.080 --> 01:45:50.640]   school it's not helping the three teslas there's a handheld controller that's bluetooth and you can
[01:45:50.640 --> 01:45:55.920]   set this thing for from 12 miles an hour up to 22 miles an hour for about six miles and correct
[01:45:55.920 --> 01:46:00.960]   me bro this is the um this is how rich developers and staff are just so wind up in the er yeah that's
[01:46:00.960 --> 01:46:05.920]   exactly right yeah uh they now they break their elbows it does have breaks on it uh the breaks are
[01:46:05.920 --> 01:46:10.080]   the breaks stop the board but you go flying yeah you go fine right so there's this thing called inertia
[01:46:10.080 --> 01:46:15.680]   and it's a long board with a relatively low center gravity but you will die it is true i
[01:46:15.680 --> 01:46:20.080]   this was uh i met the founder i passed on investing in this thing but the way it works the boosted
[01:46:20.080 --> 01:46:25.680]   board is you have a hand controller that looks like those old rc controllers like a radio controller
[01:46:25.680 --> 01:46:29.520]   and that's how you pick your speed that's right and i am seeing more and more of them in the city
[01:46:29.520 --> 01:46:35.440]   they have a battery pack underneath them and it goes what 15 miles per hour up to 22 on the new
[01:46:35.440 --> 01:46:40.320]   version what's amazing about this is that way with second 22 miles an hour it's scary but it's
[01:46:40.320 --> 01:46:45.520]   so bicycle how fast if you're pedaling fast on level ground how fast is a bicycle in 15
[01:46:45.520 --> 01:46:51.120]   your your bikes have 26 inch wheels or 27 inch wheels and this thing has has just like two inch
[01:46:51.120 --> 01:46:55.840]   wheels so the big thing is with all the potholes around the city and you watch kasey nista at one
[01:46:55.840 --> 01:47:00.720]   of the other youtube yes yes he's going around new york without a helmet dodging potholes and taxi
[01:47:00.720 --> 01:47:06.240]   cabs while filming right so i listen this is a message to kasey kasey you know i love you you
[01:47:06.240 --> 01:47:10.800]   have great hair i will not debate it that guy's got great hair you have great hair too thank you
[01:47:10.800 --> 01:47:14.960]   put a helmet on i know you got great hair put a helmet on i mean if i had that hair i probably
[01:47:14.960 --> 01:47:19.920]   wouldn't wear a helmet as well but for safety we don't want kasey this to have missed some episodes
[01:47:19.920 --> 01:47:24.240]   what does that think i mean embarrass yourself even more you're an adult where with the electric
[01:47:24.240 --> 01:47:28.720]   skateboard how much did you pay for this this is over a thousand dollars yes 1500 bucks you pay
[01:47:28.720 --> 01:47:33.600]   yeah with i get 1500 for skateboard yeah well a few years ago i built a skateboard for my
[01:47:33.600 --> 01:47:37.920]   43rd birthday so i'm like well that's a couple three years ago i had to push it
[01:47:39.200 --> 01:47:45.120]   and i wanted to get around the city in a new way because i i quit writing vespas so
[01:47:45.120 --> 01:47:50.240]   you start with the vespas vespas are safe yeah i would rebuild vespas crashed and bring them back
[01:47:50.240 --> 01:47:55.840]   to life yeah and i wanted to try this skateboard so but my favorite thing for learning and education
[01:47:55.840 --> 01:48:00.640]   is easy robot and if you think about arduino raspberry pi all these platforms you can put sensors
[01:48:00.640 --> 01:48:08.240]   on them you can make robots but the website is easy dash robot.com and my buddy dj made this product
[01:48:08.240 --> 01:48:15.200]   that is essentially the uber um are you going to i don't know what side that is easy
[01:48:15.200 --> 01:48:21.040]   no that's how you do something else okay um so easy robot lets you do programming logic
[01:48:21.040 --> 01:48:31.360]   camera detection machine learning scripting nice and for 200 bucks there's dj for 200
[01:48:31.360 --> 01:48:36.080]   bucks you get this platform that everything's in the box and the servos won't burn out if you
[01:48:36.080 --> 01:48:41.120]   would try and piece this together on your own you'd have a hodgepodge of systems and these guys have
[01:48:41.120 --> 01:48:45.760]   nailed it with education and stem and steam. Brian what do you got what do you play with
[01:48:45.760 --> 01:48:50.000]   this? i have simple gadget needs i mean we have that vibe we have you know like my phone i don't
[01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:54.240]   we don't have a lot of stuff the apple tv right no new app no software it's a yeah so app
[01:48:54.240 --> 01:48:59.120]   any business software anything specific i mean i live in slack um i gotta say if i had to pick
[01:48:59.120 --> 01:49:04.400]   a technology react native so you know all all for decades they've said you just program it in
[01:49:04.400 --> 01:49:08.560]   java it's gonna run everywhere and doesn't right react native actually does that so i'm having a
[01:49:08.560 --> 01:49:12.960]   lot of fun uh being a developer again after retiring from that you know years and years ago
[01:49:12.960 --> 01:49:20.960]   um so react native uh kevin rose has a new uh fasting app that he has which is called zero and
[01:49:20.960 --> 01:49:25.200]   it allows you to pick a fast because people are saying hey fasting is probably how humans
[01:49:25.200 --> 01:49:29.840]   biology worked originally one of the reason we're all getting so goddamn fat is because
[01:49:30.400 --> 01:49:34.720]   we don't fast and there's like three or four different types of fasting one of them is cicadian
[01:49:34.720 --> 01:49:40.480]   which is uh i think means uh something about those bugs in the mars and crickets or something
[01:49:40.480 --> 01:49:46.160]   no cicadian means i think you go to bed we circadian circadian circadian circadian
[01:49:46.160 --> 01:49:49.280]   circadian circadian circadian all right whatever i'm sorry i didn't go to graduate school peter
[01:49:49.280 --> 01:49:56.560]   circadian circadian i don't know anyway whatever this is the bug yeah cubic
[01:49:56.560 --> 01:50:02.240]   cubic sarconian the sarconian uh fasting is you when you go to bed when the sunset goes down you
[01:50:02.240 --> 01:50:06.080]   stop eating and then when you when the sun comes up you can eat again and it's just it's a simple
[01:50:06.080 --> 01:50:12.560]   app it's free he's not monotizing it yet uh but it works really well uh and there's another title
[01:50:12.560 --> 01:50:16.720]   i didn't go to graduate school peter but that is why they call it breakfast because you're breaking
[01:50:16.720 --> 01:50:22.720]   the fast correct thanks bro and then he's doing another he's doing like uh another one of the
[01:50:22.720 --> 01:50:27.680]   things like i just had cabin on my podcast and he's doing a um
[01:50:27.680 --> 01:50:35.360]   app for meditation called oak yeah but if you type into facebook groups you do search for oak
[01:50:35.360 --> 01:50:40.960]   meditation app he's doing a group where you can watch him build the app and learn how much it costs
[01:50:40.960 --> 01:50:47.520]   to your point uh brian react native is like building websites but the you can make one code
[01:50:47.520 --> 01:50:52.000]   base that works on android the web basically css and javascript and then you get an android
[01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:56.800]   but it it feels snappy like an app it's really really good it's close to that apple gonna let
[01:50:56.800 --> 01:51:01.280]   you into the app store with it or are they gonna be persnickety uh no so we we've we've we've already
[01:51:01.280 --> 01:51:04.320]   done and i have friends that have done for clippa so it obviously yeah so so you're in the app store
[01:51:04.320 --> 01:51:08.160]   but even better than that is it's a a job a job script bundle that runs the whole thing right and
[01:51:08.160 --> 01:51:12.880]   you can circumvent the app store so not only can you uh well what i mean is uh not only while you're
[01:51:12.880 --> 01:51:16.800]   developing can you see it faster in a simulator on your phone is look like that which is way faster
[01:51:16.800 --> 01:51:20.560]   than doing let's say let's go to switch the next but once you get into the app store you put a
[01:51:20.560 --> 01:51:25.280]   major version in there you make a bunch of changes that aren't native code you can push them all
[01:51:25.280 --> 01:51:29.440]   day long without apple's approval because apple's cool with it the diff the diff changes right so
[01:51:29.440 --> 01:51:34.000]   what happens is the app the app fires up and says it's like checking a cdn is there a new javascript
[01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:40.080]   bundle and you can set it for on wake or on first load or sign in and then i'll mind go no it'll
[01:51:40.080 --> 01:51:44.080]   download so that's how your news feed can go all the avatars are on the left now they're all on a
[01:51:44.080 --> 01:51:47.200]   right and you don't have to worry that the people two versions back are still seeing them on the
[01:51:47.200 --> 01:51:51.440]   left so this is apple's original position on the app store was that they don't want you making
[01:51:51.440 --> 01:51:55.040]   changes that they don't check so how does that change it does that mean the people doing react
[01:51:55.040 --> 01:51:59.040]   have an advantage now uh so i do i think people react to react to have an advantage because of
[01:51:59.040 --> 01:52:04.720]   this code technology but uh if you think about it it's it's design changes it's not fundamental
[01:52:04.720 --> 01:52:09.440]   it doesn't change how the app works okay right but it changes how it looks so which is kind of how
[01:52:09.440 --> 01:52:12.400]   the app works so i kind of feel like you're splitting here is i don't want to get you in trouble but
[01:52:12.400 --> 01:52:16.640]   i'm kind of going in a uh you know a news feed a web page you can change that all day long so think
[01:52:16.640 --> 01:52:20.480]   of it like that it's interesting because they wanted to have control over apps
[01:52:20.480 --> 01:52:27.440]   and it's one of the reasons things work so smoothly on apple and on andro you have all these
[01:52:27.440 --> 01:52:31.040]   copycat apps and chaos right and security issues in the app store
[01:52:31.040 --> 01:52:36.880]   rogue rogue but it shouldn't introduce any security issues or any malicious code issues i think
[01:52:36.880 --> 01:52:41.760]   that's that's why they allow it and they're certainly tightening the news a bit over at apple with the
[01:52:41.760 --> 01:52:49.280]   apps or where like the asking the incessant begging for reviews right which is so annoying yeah there
[01:52:49.280 --> 01:52:55.360]   should be a global setting where i can say do not ask me for reviews i don't care about your review
[01:52:55.360 --> 01:53:01.760]   issue for your app if you ask automatically zero stars no like ways is like i love ways
[01:53:01.760 --> 01:53:09.040]   save so much time but ways is like did you know that our rank is if you will you know you can help
[01:53:09.040 --> 01:53:12.240]   spread the word i'm like i'm not here to spread the word about your app i don't want to do the
[01:53:12.240 --> 01:53:18.400]   rating system i don't care all right listen it's been an amazing episode of this week in tag if
[01:53:18.400 --> 01:53:23.680]   i do say so myself uh i don't i do i pick the actual name or you guys are going to pick the name in
[01:53:23.680 --> 01:53:30.720]   the chat room give us suggestions for names right now uh and what's that in the show at the end of
[01:53:30.720 --> 01:53:37.520]   the show i'll do that um and uh we'll wrap up now i'll thank peter rojas if peter if people want to
[01:53:37.520 --> 01:53:42.880]   pitch you on an app and get your money as a venture capitalist they should just call your mobile phone
[01:53:42.880 --> 01:53:48.640]   which is four one five no what is the best way i have a two-line two cell number you're still rocking
[01:53:48.640 --> 01:53:54.000]   two one two yeah so still you know i think i've given my seven one eight number just to effort
[01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:59.040]   people okay just a crackle voice i got a bunch i have every you know what i have to allis austin
[01:53:59.040 --> 01:54:05.200]   i was looking at your premium numbers i was thinking like maybe it'd be baller to have like you know
[01:54:05.200 --> 01:54:09.680]   whatever two one two five or whatever four one five five five five five one two one two or something
[01:54:09.680 --> 01:54:14.880]   they have like yeah or one thousand you know what those costs those are expensive i think i guess
[01:54:14.880 --> 01:54:19.440]   that's an eighty grand no i didn't say an eighty grand one i was
[01:54:19.440 --> 01:54:25.440]   five hundred dollars to about ten thousand dollars was the range for and i think the ten
[01:54:25.440 --> 01:54:29.520]   thousand ones were like the one thousand yeah you know like four five six well there's a card
[01:54:29.520 --> 01:54:33.040]   service in new york six six six six six six six six that one i don't know or mail or mail yeah
[01:54:33.680 --> 01:54:37.200]   they paid a lot of money for that yeah i was having wasnac has all these
[01:54:37.200 --> 01:54:41.760]   numbers he's been collecting phone numbers for decades and he can't use them because there's such
[01:54:41.760 --> 01:54:46.560]   easy numbers that when kids pick up the phone we all that used to be dial tone by the way there
[01:54:46.560 --> 01:54:51.440]   used to be this thing he would pick up wasniac collects phone numbers premium phone numbers he's
[01:54:51.440 --> 01:54:55.280]   been doing it because he was a phone free he's a freaker back in the day that's how he got started
[01:54:55.280 --> 01:55:01.600]   interesting you mentioned that by first um experience with computers you remember this brian
[01:55:01.600 --> 01:55:09.440]   when we were at sevarion was i got a war dialer and sprint used to allow you sprint had one phone
[01:55:09.440 --> 01:55:15.360]   number you'd call the number then you would dial the number you wanted to dial then you would dial
[01:55:15.360 --> 01:55:19.600]   a five-digit it would give you a different sounding dial tone then you would put in a five-digit code
[01:55:19.600 --> 01:55:23.600]   or six-digit code and what the war dialer did on the ibm pc journey with the ventel three hundred
[01:55:23.600 --> 01:55:28.320]   barmodem is it would just guess numbers and you'd wake up in the morning with five new numbers
[01:55:28.320 --> 01:55:34.000]   this is for bridges for for bridging a phone call so then we started at our school we were driving
[01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:39.040]   from further for bbs's well we just got free phone numbers we could get free usage of phones
[01:55:39.040 --> 01:55:44.480]   yeah and the idea was then we could call the california bbs bbs's for a dollar a minute and we started
[01:55:44.480 --> 01:55:48.000]   doing that and then at school i started telling people i could do this and we started using the
[01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:52.400]   phone at sevarion to do it but then i started getting paranoid that people were watching us or
[01:55:52.400 --> 01:55:56.000]   that there might be the fbi or cia because i heard people got busted in queens and we stopped doing
[01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:59.920]   it a little bit like proxies that sort of thing like people would say okay you know i want to
[01:55:59.920 --> 01:56:05.040]   balance off it's just basically yeah think about how craziness was sprint would allow you we you
[01:56:05.040 --> 01:56:09.120]   would get a code for in your office for sprint like if you were traveling salesperson yeah and they
[01:56:09.120 --> 01:56:14.640]   just say use a six-digit code dial sprint dial the six-digit code then dial whatever phone number
[01:56:14.640 --> 01:56:17.760]   you want that's how it works that's yeah i mean that's how you used to do if you traveled a lot
[01:56:17.760 --> 01:56:22.560]   that's how you did long you went up to a pay phone and you did that you dialed there 800 number yeah
[01:56:22.560 --> 01:56:27.920]   that you're your six-digit code so you could guess them yeah it was crazy it was nutty
[01:56:27.920 --> 01:56:32.400]   i can't believe i didn't get caught ah as we hold the b and jail right now
[01:56:32.400 --> 01:56:36.160]   all right well i'm going to talk about the statue of so i guess the statue of the statue's
[01:56:36.160 --> 01:56:40.000]   statue's got to be out right i mean i don't know maybe see i maybe the fbi is waiting for us after
[01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:46.880]   this uh gajig i gave matthews everybody check out new air and follow ggdm that's it follow gg
[01:56:47.680 --> 01:56:54.560]   dm on twitter twitter instagram instagram all the fun sir sir and uh listen i'm going to go back
[01:56:54.560 --> 01:56:58.960]   to burning man this year cool i'll be there and into you at burning man that was lovely uh you had a
[01:56:58.960 --> 01:57:05.040]   um bowing 747 that we turned into one of the largest art pieces at burning man and when he says
[01:57:05.040 --> 01:57:12.160]   he had a a bowing 747 what i mean by that is he had cut the first half of a jet yeah we bought the
[01:57:12.160 --> 01:57:17.280]   whole plane of the Mojave where this is and it's a big imagination.org if you want to check this out
[01:57:17.760 --> 01:57:21.920]   we're raising funds right now because it's really expensive it turns out to bring a non-flying
[01:57:21.920 --> 01:57:26.720]   fuselage to the pli and we've got benefactors that are coming in to help max out but you did this
[01:57:26.720 --> 01:57:34.080]   one time when you get the plane there then you've outfitted it with LEDs yep 24,700 LEDs here it is
[01:57:34.080 --> 01:57:39.280]   that i had a team this is the 747 the Mojave this is by scaled composites how old is that
[01:57:39.280 --> 01:57:44.480]   plane from the 60s or something 75 as we cut the parts as we cut it apart here we're cutting the
[01:57:44.480 --> 01:57:49.520]   wing off in this photo there'll be first story views to look out amongst the pli and when you're
[01:57:49.520 --> 01:57:54.160]   in the upper deck that'll be ultimately a convertible from that bubble and from that convertible it'll
[01:57:54.160 --> 01:57:58.720]   be this is the one i saw a three story view yeah you saw the first portion of the plane yeah so this
[01:57:58.720 --> 01:58:04.640]   is a five year project i was in the cockpit yep we had the smile high club um uh in the cockpit
[01:58:04.640 --> 01:58:09.920]   and um the whole idea with this is we wanted to build the largest moving art piece that we could
[01:58:09.920 --> 01:58:14.960]   bring everyone together because burning man has what's called radical inclusion anyone can do
[01:58:14.960 --> 01:58:19.440]   anything when we built our cars before and a card that i did with some of my crew was charlie the
[01:58:19.440 --> 01:58:23.840]   art car which made its way to a quiz nose commercial you might have seen making fun of burning man
[01:58:23.840 --> 01:58:28.720]   we could we had to push people away and we thought with the airplane we could have a fuselage that
[01:58:28.720 --> 01:58:32.480]   you fit a lot of people as many people yeah and there were a good number of people inside of it
[01:58:32.480 --> 01:58:36.400]   so every year we're bringing back more of the plane so we'll have the full plane there and for
[01:58:36.400 --> 01:58:40.480]   you so what's it's like to be able to have millions of dollars that you can put into a pile of money
[01:58:40.480 --> 01:58:46.480]   and a pile and then just burn yeah i mean who underwrites the buying of a how much of this cost be
[01:58:46.480 --> 01:58:51.840]   honest so it's a multi-million dollar project but we have benefactors and investors behind it i'm
[01:58:51.840 --> 01:58:57.040]   labor so i'm i give away my case there's not your moving not not not your money not my money but
[01:58:57.040 --> 01:59:02.400]   let's just i just say some billionaire i don't i thought that this would be cool and gave you guys
[01:59:02.400 --> 01:59:08.880]   millions of dollars no uh a single one we we beg borrow plead we raised seventy nine thousand
[01:59:08.880 --> 01:59:13.680]   dollars on indy go-go last year to help fund the moving of it the plane is stolen that's what he's
[01:59:13.680 --> 01:59:17.680]   all right i i got the plane we bought for aluminum value because no engines are on the plane
[01:59:17.680 --> 01:59:21.520]   god okay so you get it it's like a hollywood plane it was when they would might shoot a set
[01:59:21.520 --> 01:59:26.560]   where's the plane now so we bring it to girlock which is the community outside of burning man and
[01:59:26.560 --> 01:59:31.920]   it sits there so we have to do rolling road closures because it blocks three lanes of traffic well
[01:59:32.800 --> 01:59:36.240]   given all the serious problems we have in society i'm glad that you're putting
[01:59:36.240 --> 01:59:42.160]   the it's a non-profit we're doing this i know i'm breaking chops
[01:59:42.160 --> 01:59:47.680]   art has its art has its specific value art has a value in the world
[01:59:47.680 --> 01:59:52.240]   i just don't think it's a couple million dollars but okay i'm you know like this and there's some
[01:59:52.240 --> 01:59:59.440]   guy who wrapped a huge building in orange yeah yeah sure of the gates in new york right yeah i
[01:59:59.440 --> 02:00:03.680]   thought that was pretty cool too it's art hey listen who am i to criticize it i mean i'm gonna
[02:00:03.680 --> 02:00:08.160]   criticize it but but i curate the art program on the plane so if you're an artist and you want to
[02:00:08.160 --> 02:00:14.160]   put your works inside of the space we have a digital interactive space with the latest technology
[02:00:14.160 --> 02:00:19.920]   in the dustiest environment in the world so we can uh it's crazy all right and uh brian alvey uh
