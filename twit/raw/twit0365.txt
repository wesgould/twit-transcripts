[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.920]   I will start from right to left, Cara Swisher, from all things
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.920]   D. Great to have you, Cara.
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:40.440]   Hi.
[00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.320]   It's great to see you once again.
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.240]   Mr. Patrick Norton from Techzilla.
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.640]   Hey, everybody.
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.000]   Part of the Discovery Networks.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.280]   Woo-hoo.
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.080]   Great to have you.
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.880]   And of course, our show, "Twitch," this week in Computer
[00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:52.220]   Hardware.
[00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.080]   Great show, boy.
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.440]   Last week when you do it in here.
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.200]   And it was fun to see you guys.
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.760]   Yeah, it was awesome.
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.520]   Mr. Justin Robert Young of NSFW and author--
[00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:03.360]   No.
[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.800]   Well, I--
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:05.400]   A contributor.
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.120]   I can say that I'm a friend of Patricia Harkins Bradley.
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.640]   A friend of the amazing Patricia Harkins Bradley.
[00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:11.680]   He has a very hot book.
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.040]   We'll talk about it called "Diamond Club"
[00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.200]   that is rising up through the charts.
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.000]   Burn it up the charts.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.920]   Burn it up the charts.
[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:18.680]   Literary phenomenon.
[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:19.680]   On the iBook store.
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.320]   Just an incredible thing.
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.400]   And I think you know--
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:23.280]   she's kind of a recluse.
[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.160]   But I think you know her.
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.320]   So we'll get the inside story there from you.
[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.200]   And yeah, everybody in the chatroom's doing this.
[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:30.680]   There we go.
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:31.520]   I got to do it right.
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:32.000]   There we go.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.240]   That's quite a snake on the I'm in day.
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.600]   And Ed Bot is also with us.
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:39.560]   Great to see Ed, boy.
[00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:40.960]   I've known Ed for so many years.
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.200]   Former editor of--
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.960]   I like to throw this in, Ed.
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.520]   Was it PC-- what was PC computing?
[00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.360]   PC computing, editor of PC computing.
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.000]   And before that, managing editor of PC World.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.080]   PC World is when you and I used to be--
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.040]   we used to do--
[00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.360]   well, you did John de Borek show on--
[00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.860]   Right.
[00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:02.040]   And John would drag you in.
[00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.840]   And it was great to have you.
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:04.840]   Yeah, he'd go off.
[00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:05.800]   I don't know where he'd go.
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.120]   And I'd come in and make John's place.
[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.480]   Ed does the Ed Bot report on ZDNet,
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.320]   great ZDNet blog talking about mostly Microsoft.
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.600]   But anything else you feel like talking about?
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.280]   Yeah, there'll be some Google and iCloud stuff this week.
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:22.080]   I'm pretty sure.
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.920]   Good.
[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.160]   Well, we'll find out.
[00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.760]   But before we get into the meat of the matter,
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.080]   I wanted to introduce Matt Hohn.
[00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.560]   And I've known Matt for quite some time.
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.920]   You might remember him from Gizmodo.
[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.120]   Are you working for Wired now?
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.480]   Or are you just freelancer Matt?
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:35.000]   I am.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.280]   I'm a full-time at Wired now.
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:37.960]   For time at Wired.
[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:43.000]   And I read an article that just terrified me, a blog post
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.760]   that you wrote on your blog about getting hacked.
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.240]   And you can read it at emptyage.com
[00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.960]   if you want to read the story.
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.080]   But I thought we'd get Matt on because I think it's a--
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.520]   I don't know.
[00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:03.240]   I think this is a morality tale for the cloud generation.
[00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.200]   What happened?
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.880]   I think that there are several things
[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:06.960]   that are interesting about it.
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:13.600]   We're all increasingly relying on cloud services.
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.160]   And a lot of us, myself at least,
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.600]   tend to link accounts together.
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:22.320]   And both of those things, when combined,
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.200]   can make for some really dangerous situations.
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.440]   So you had an iCloud account.
[00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:28.560]   Right.
[00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.840]   And you turned on a feature of iCloud,
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.440]   which I think is actually a useful feature.
[00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:33.680]   It's the remote wipe feature.
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.200]   So they've had for a while with the Find My iPhone.
[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.400]   You could remote-wipe a lost iPhone.
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.160]   And they now have it.
[00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:40.600]   And I think this is new in Mountain Line.
[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:41.880]   I don't remember it before.
[00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:45.760]   The ability to remote wipe a laptop.
[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:49.360]   It was certainly a lion feature because I haven't upgraded
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.440]   to the National Lion on my MacBook yet.
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.440]   But yeah, and so what happened, if you've
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:00.760]   registered me to get into it, what happened was Friday,
[00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:05.160]   I left work a little early and was home just before 5 o'clock.
[00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:06.240]   And I started playing with my daughter.
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.240]   And my phone died.
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:09.480]   Our looks get died.
[00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:11.240]   And I went to go plug it in.
[00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.840]   And when I plugged it in, it started up to the screen,
[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.160]   the start screen.
[00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:16.640]   Like the initial start screen that you get when you first
[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:17.760]   get a new iPhone.
[00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:19.360]   This is plugged into iTunes.
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.080]   I thought that's weird, but things happen.
[00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.120]   And I went downstairs to connect it to my Mac
[00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:28.640]   because I backed up really recently to my desktop
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.800]   and restored from that backup.
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:31.360]   I'm sorry.
[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.160]   I should say, when I tried to log into iCloud,
[00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:34.400]   it said my password was wrong.
[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.080]   And again, I didn't think that much of it.
[00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:39.680]   I went downstairs, flipped up my MacBook.
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:43.080]   And it almost instantly went to a gray screen
[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.960]   and asked for a pin to log in, a fordage at pin.
[00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.400]   And at that point, I knew I had real problems.
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:49.840]   And what turned out that it happened
[00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:52.920]   was that someone hacked into my iCloud account using,
[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:55.160]   basically, social engineering techniques.
[00:06:55.160 --> 00:07:00.880]   And they were able to remove, wipe my iPhone, iPad, and MacBook.
[00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:03.720]   And because I'm a terrible computer user,
[00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.880]   I hadn't backed up my MacBook in a really long time.
[00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:10.160]   Well, you did something else bad, which was you had iCloud
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:17.440]   as your password recovery for both Gmail and Twitter.
[00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:19.040]   I actually just Gmail.
[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:22.920]   So that was-- yeah, that really exasperated things.
[00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:28.320]   So what happened next was that the apology of pencils
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:30.880]   basically-- and I've been in touch with the person
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:31.880]   who hacked into my account.
[00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:33.720]   They were ultimately trying just to get my Twitter.
[00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:35.320]   They just wanted my--
[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:38.000]   Because you had the Gizmodo Twitter account.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.120]   They weren't even trying to get to the Gizmodo Twitter
[00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:40.620]   account.
[00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:41.560]   Who is one Matt?
[00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:43.080]   They just wanted Matt.
[00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:45.360]   The Gizmodo Twitter account was just a bonus.
[00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:49.040]   They didn't even realize it was connected until they got into mine.
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:50.800]   At some point, you can link Twitter accounts.
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.560]   And so at some point, when I worked with Gizmodo,
[00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:56.400]   I had linked my Twitter account with Gizmodo's Twitter account
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:58.560]   so I could not have to log in and log out every time
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:07:59.680]   in the web.
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.680]   And that hadn't been undone since I left.
[00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:02.800]   Even though you had left Twitter.
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:04.160]   I mean, Gizmodo, yeah.
[00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:04.640]   Right.
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:05.880]   Yeah.
[00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:06.880]   I saw it still linked.
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:08.480]   They didn't actually have password level access
[00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:10.000]   to the Gizmodo Twitter account.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.920]   They just had password level access to my Twitter account.
[00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:17.240]   So what they did was they used a social engineering technique
[00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:18.840]   to get to my iCloud account.
[00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:24.480]   They used the my .Mac email as the backup email for Gmail,
[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:27.080]   got into my Gmail, and he's Gmail.
[00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:29.320]   That's the account verification for Twitter
[00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:31.880]   and got into my Twitter account.
[00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:32.360]   Wow.
[00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:33.720]   Now you did a few things wrong.
[00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:36.200]   And there's going to be pedantic people I know in our chat
[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:39.360]   and I said, well, if you had only done this, this, and this,
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:42.480]   and of course, but this is the kind of thing we're all doing.
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:46.400]   And this is kind of the reason I think it's a morality tip.
[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:48.480]   You at first thought your password maybe had been hacked
[00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:49.640]   or brute forced.
[00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:50.080]   Right.
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:51.400]   Yeah, that was my initial suspicion.
[00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:56.440]   I mean, I just thought that I had a seven digit alpha
[00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:57.680]   numeric password.
[00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:58.160]   And--
[00:08:58.160 --> 00:08:59.160]   That's pretty weak.
[00:08:59.160 --> 00:08:59.760]   I've had it for years.
[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:00.760]   Yeah, and that's pretty weak.
[00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:02.440]   And I just haven't changed your satellites.
[00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:03.840]   I don't use it anywhere else.
[00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:04.600]   But that's not a--
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:04.960]   That's not a--
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:06.600]   I mean, most of my passwords-- I use one password.
[00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:09.920]   And most of my passwords now, the new password generator,
[00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:11.640]   15 characters, 16 characters.
[00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:15.520]   And so I thought, OK, well, someone
[00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:19.240]   used some sort of technique to crack my password.
[00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:20.440]   A lot of other people were speculating
[00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:25.560]   that someone had set up some sort of intercept to a key
[00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:28.040]   stroke logger or something.
[00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:31.800]   But as it turned out, both the hacker told me and Apple
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:35.920]   subsequently verified Apple Tech Support, verified with me.
[00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:39.720]   Someone called Apple Tech Support at 430 on Friday,
[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:44.800]   around 430 on Friday, claimed to be me, knew some details,
[00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:50.680]   knew enough details, and was able to have a temporary password
[00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:52.720]   issued.
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.040]   When the temporary password was issued,
[00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:57.520]   they were able to log into iCloud and completely change
[00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:58.040]   the password.
[00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:00.440]   And that was kind of step one, step two,
[00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:04.040]   was wiping all my stuff so that I couldn't go in and stop them.
[00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:06.720]   And step three was going into my Gmail
[00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:07.760]   and getting my Twitter.
[00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:10.160]   Step four was they deleted my Google account.
[00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:13.760]   And then they just went crazy on my Twitter account
[00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:15.720]   for several hours on Friday.
[00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:17.640]   You say the hacker contacted you.
[00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:20.720]   How do you know it's him or her?
[00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:24.560]   I should say I'm not positive that it's him or her,
[00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:27.000]   but they've given me details that allow--
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.360]   that they've given me enough details,
[00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:29.800]   including some account details, that I
[00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:33.640]   know that if it wasn't the person who actually did it,
[00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:35.080]   that the person was certainly involved in it.
[00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:37.080]   They know stuff that something else wouldn't
[00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:39.000]   be able to tell me.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.320]   And they were targeting your Twitter account.
[00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:42.760]   That was what this whole thing was about
[00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:45.160]   was so they could put stuff on your Twitter account.
[00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:46.800]   Well, me and the guy said, we just
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:49.120]   want your Twitter account.
[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:50.960]   We just did a--
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:54.440]   he said we didn't have anything personal against you.
[00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:56.560]   You've got that account back.
[00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:57.520]   I do have that account.
[00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:59.640]   I've got now all my accounts back.
[00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:02.360]   And Apple has my book.
[00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:04.600]   I mean, the big priority for me is recovering my data.
[00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:07.280]   I've got a young child.
[00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:09.600]   And I just hate thinking of all the pictures
[00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:12.200]   that I lost all my data.
[00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:12.680]   No kidding.
[00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:17.880]   Anybody have any questions for Matt?
[00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:20.600]   What do they put up on your Twitter account?
[00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:21.800]   Correct.
[00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:22.600]   Was this spam?
[00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:24.560]   Why were they trying to make money off?
[00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:25.440]   What were they--
[00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:27.000]   wasn't for the lulls?
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.920]   Links to some YouTube videos, links to some other exports
[00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:36.720]   they'd done, some screen racist homophobic statements.
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:38.680]   Just--
[00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:41.600]   So you were just someone with a bunch of followers,
[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:46.880]   and they wanted a platform to yell and scream like idiots?
[00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:47.920]   I think basically, yeah.
[00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:50.360]   And they liked that it was a three-letter Twitter account.
[00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:51.360]   It's my account.
[00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:56.520]   It's @MAT, which means you join Twitter very, very, very,
[00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:58.520]   very early.
[00:11:58.520 --> 00:11:59.040]   I guess so.
[00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:00.200]   And made yourself a target.
[00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:01.600]   I've got a question here.
[00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:03.480]   Yes, I said.
[00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:07.520]   Matt, do you feel, in some sense--
[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:10.400]   I know this might be slightly insensitive question to ask--
[00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:13.760]   but do you feel lucky in a way that these guys
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:18.520]   weren't evil and malicious and skillful enough
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:21.000]   to hide their tracks for days or weeks
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.080]   while they mined your information and maybe
[00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:27.240]   tried to social engineer some of your contacts?
[00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:28.720]   Certainly, absolutely.
[00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:29.240]   100%.
[00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:32.720]   I mean, the first thing I did was call--
[00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:34.880]   before I even realized that my Gmail had gotten hacked.
[00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:36.640]   First thing I did was call Apple.
[00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:38.480]   And I was on the phone with their tech
[00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:39.880]   support for a very long time.
[00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:41.560]   And I kept telling them I got to get off the phone
[00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:43.040]   and call my bank.
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:45.160]   Because I mean, I was really worried that they were immediately
[00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:47.360]   going to go into my online bank.
[00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:49.280]   Once you get into somebody's email, you can get everything.
[00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:51.840]   And I was worried they were going to go into my online banking,
[00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:57.120]   go into any number of other accounts, and just clean me out.
[00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:59.880]   That was my big concern at the time.
[00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:02.200]   But you also have--
[00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:05.200]   I'm sure a very impressive address book.
[00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:08.600]   Patrick just changed his Twitter password
[00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:10.040]   for the second time of 24 hours.
[00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:11.160]   I think you're now alone.
[00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:13.120]   I think there's people listening right now who
[00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:14.800]   are all furiously--
[00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:16.720]   first thing I did when I heard this
[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:20.680]   is I put turn on two factor authentication on my Google account.
[00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:21.180]   But go ahead.
[00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:21.680]   I'm sorry.
[00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:22.680]   I didn't mean to interrupt you.
[00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:23.180]   Go ahead.
[00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:23.680]   That's OK.
[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:26.280]   So you must have a pretty impressive address book
[00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:32.120]   with contacts that if somebody wanted to social engineer
[00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:37.720]   people you know, people at Apple, people at Google, people
[00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:42.720]   who are your sources, they could do a fair amount of damage.
[00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:44.760]   And they could actually use exploits
[00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:48.040]   and install keyloggers on those people's machines.
[00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:51.880]   So in a sense, I mean, as a wake up call goes,
[00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:53.720]   this is a very painful and ugly one.
[00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:58.440]   But the damage is hopefully contained
[00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:00.880]   in a way that it wouldn't have been if somebody had been
[00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:03.360]   truly malicious and evil.
[00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:05.920]   Yeah, it was certainly a wake up call to me.
[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:10.080]   To be honest, I hadn't considered using social exploits
[00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:13.040]   to get to other people from my account.
[00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:14.560]   But it could--
[00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:17.680]   I mean, I hate to say it, but I just
[00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:19.120]   keep thinking I'm kind of lucky because it really
[00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:20.200]   could have been a lot worse.
[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:25.040]   I'm really distraught about my data possibly being lost.
[00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:26.920]   But in the grand scheme of things,
[00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:29.400]   it was not-- I mean, it could have been so, so, so much worse.
[00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:31.280]   I'm just puzzled that Apple-- I don't understand
[00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:36.080]   how Apple could have been tricked.
[00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:37.480]   I'm not quite ready to--
[00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:40.440]   I'm probably going to reveal this in the Wired story tomorrow.
[00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:43.680]   I've got an email into Apple about this.
[00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:46.600]   And I want Apple-- I want to give them both a chance
[00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:48.760]   to respond and to fix this.
[00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:50.280]   But there's some information that you
[00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:53.440]   can know about someone's account that lets you bypass having
[00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:54.560]   to answer the security questions.
[00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:57.800]   So there's a flaw in their system?
[00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:59.200]   I mean, I think so.
[00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:00.040]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:01.640]   I mean, it's not information that's easy to get.
[00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:03.800]   I mean, I don't think I could have gotten it.
[00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:06.000]   I got the impression from the message the hacker sent you
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.120]   that he knew of this flaw, that he was exploiting a known flaw.
[00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:12.680]   Yeah, that's the impression that I have as well.
[00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:15.200]   I mean, I have the impression that this was--
[00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:17.720]   My understanding is that there are multiple people involved
[00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:22.080]   in this, and they had multiple areas of expertise.
[00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:23.960]   The guy who I've been in touch with--
[00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:26.240]   and I've only been in touch with one person
[00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:29.240]   this apparently was his area of expertise.
[00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:31.800]   Matt, did you get a sense that beyond just being
[00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:34.000]   a person with a three-letter account that they
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.960]   knew who you were?
[00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:38.120]   I got actually the sense that they did not know who I was.
[00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:42.040]   So you were-- it was just-- it could be Ray or Joe.
[00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:42.560]   Yeah, that was--
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:43.040]   On Twitter.
[00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:44.560]   It was just three letters.
[00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:46.160]   That's why they targeted you.
[00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:47.360]   That's my impression.
[00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:50.360]   I mean, that's what they have said to me.
[00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:53.040]   I mean, you know, I don't know.
[00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:54.920]   How do you know?
[00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:57.280]   And you-- and what are you doing now to protect--
[00:15:57.280 --> 00:15:59.800]   obviously, you've got backup from now on.
[00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:05.520]   Well, I disabled to find my iPhone and to find my iPad.
[00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:07.280]   I'm looking at my iCloud.
[00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:09.240]   You can erase my desktop computer.
[00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:12.160]   If you can erase my computer at home,
[00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:15.840]   you can remote wipe any of these computers that are on currently.
[00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:17.160]   Just press that remote wipe button.
[00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:19.600]   If you got in my iCloud, you could wipe.
[00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:21.680]   Don't click that pattern.
[00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:23.640]   Leo, something that happens when you do that
[00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:27.360]   is that it initiates a four-digit pin.
[00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:29.200]   And only the person who presses that button
[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:31.040]   gets to see that four-digit pin.
[00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:34.640]   So if I'm on the other end, if you're on the other end
[00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:36.960]   and someone does that, you don't really have any way
[00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:37.600]   to stop it.
[00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:39.960]   And this is one of the things that I think really ought
[00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:41.200]   to be fixed about that situation,
[00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:42.680]   is that if there's going to be a pin code,
[00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:43.800]   ought to be something that you set up,
[00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:45.040]   or there ought to be a second password,
[00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:48.040]   there ought to be something that lets the person basically
[00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:51.000]   stop this in their tracks, or that at least has
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.040]   some sort of secondary level of authentication
[00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:59.400]   before you can pull a trigger and remotely wipe a hard drive.
[00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:01.640]   I mean, it's wiping a Mac.
[00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:03.200]   I kind of gradually got into this.
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:04.720]   So I first, I had to find my iPhone set up,
[00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:07.160]   and then I was like, oh, well, I can do the same for my Mac.
[00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:09.040]   And that's actually quite different than wiping an iPhone.
[00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:10.040]   Oh, yeah.
[00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:13.280]   I feel like that ought to be-- that ought to have better security.
[00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:14.920]   That'd be harder to do.
[00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:16.320]   Matt, I'm sorry this happened to you,
[00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:18.480]   but in a way, I'm really glad that it happened to you
[00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:22.400]   and that the world now knows because of who you are.
[00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:24.520]   And I think this is-- and you're-- it's a wake-up.
[00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:25.520]   I think, Ed, you said it right.
[00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:27.480]   It's a wake-up call for everybody.
[00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:29.560]   And I hope that watching this, everybody
[00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:35.040]   is now going to secure their systems as best you can.
[00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:37.200]   Well, I mean, would you turn off the iCloud?
[00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:38.680]   Would you turn off the-- I mean, obviously,
[00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:41.880]   you've turned off the-- the "find my iPhone" or "wipe my computer"?
[00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:43.880]   Would you suggest everyone do that at this point?
[00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:49.440]   If you're backing everything up--
[00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:51.000]   I mean, see, this is-- this is--
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.560]   somewhere where I really screwed up, right?
[00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:55.560]   I mean, is-- so that wasn't backing up on my--
[00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:57.480]   I wasn't backing up my Mac, greater.
[00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:01.560]   And it's-- I back up my desktop Mac every day.
[00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:04.480]   But I had not backed up my MacBook in a long, long time.
[00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:05.200]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:06.080]   So you were backing up.
[00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:07.440]   It's just that one you didn't bet.
[00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:09.080]   And I think a lot of us who have multiple computers
[00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:10.800]   kind of assume well everything's propagating.
[00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:12.040]   I'm fine.
[00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:13.280]   Yeah, that was sort of what I-- I mean,
[00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:14.360]   you know, I just got lazy.
[00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:19.360]   And I-- so would I recommend that everybody turn off
[00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:20.680]   "find my iPhone"?
[00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:21.160]   No.
[00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:22.160]   But "find my Mac"?
[00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:24.160]   I mean, I actually probably would turn that off.
[00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:25.960]   You know where your Mac is.
[00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:26.920]   I know where it is.
[00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:27.920]   Yeah.
[00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:29.240]   It's like, what somebody asked me,
[00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:30.560]   like, what's the greater risk?
[00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:34.560]   Is it actually having your Mac physically taken
[00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:38.040]   from your possession or having someone be able to get into it
[00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:38.600]   electronically?
[00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:41.600]   And I think it's probably the greater risk, the more likely
[00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:42.720]   risk for a lot of people with a Mac.
[00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:43.560]   It's not a phone.
[00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:47.760]   It's, you know, is having it broken into electronically.
[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:48.120]   Yeah.
[00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:49.800]   If you can't find your desktop computer,
[00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:51.200]   I think you have bigger problems.
[00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:52.840]   I understand maybe you thought it got stolen.
[00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:53.320]   Blah, blah, blah.
[00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:54.840]   But that's not that likely.
[00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:57.360]   I also think that we learn a lesson about where
[00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:59.880]   to send a password recovery emails
[00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:04.040]   and to have kind of a rotating set of emails.
[00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:05.600]   And I have them all set to one place.
[00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:09.560]   The hacker obviously knew that if he did these erasers,
[00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:11.480]   you would be very-- it would be very hard for you
[00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:13.680]   to get everything back.
[00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:15.440]   Yeah, obviously.
[00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:18.640]   And I gather they sort of backtracked.
[00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:20.680]   Like, they started with Twitter and found that, OK, well,
[00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:22.360]   my Twitter is linked to my Gmail.
[00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:24.880]   And then they-- when they realized that my Gmail was
[00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:28.880]   linked to Doc Mac as the backup there,
[00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:30.800]   is the verification there.
[00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:33.960]   It was sort of like a jackpot moment for them.
[00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:39.760]   And having that all linked together was also a bad idea.
[00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:40.960]   And it's also something I've changed.
[00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:43.320]   I've set up two-factor authentication on my Gmail.
[00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:44.320]   That's a pain, by the way.
[00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:46.000]   I did it too, as soon as I read your story.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.360]   And that's a pain.
[00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:49.840]   I used to have to do it for work-related emails.
[00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:51.600]   And I always thought it was a pain.
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:52.320]   But you know what?
[00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:52.960]   I'm doing it now.
[00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:53.760]   Yep.
[00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:56.560]   You have to run Google Authenticator on your phone.
[00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:58.960]   You can authenticate Google's stuff pretty easily.
[00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:00.600]   You just add that second factor.
[00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:03.240]   But then apps that don't know about two-factor authentication,
[00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:05.560]   you have to get a special password generated from Google
[00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:07.400]   and enter both passwords.
[00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:08.560]   Well, it looked to trade off.
[00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:10.320]   Security at best is imperfect.
[00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:12.360]   There is no patch for human stupidity.
[00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:14.720]   Large, multi-billion-- no, no, no, no.
[00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:16.520]   And that's not for you, Matt.
[00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:18.000]   Think about that.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.760]   Apple's got more money than just about any corporation
[00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:21.720]   in North America.
[00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:24.320]   And they allowed somebody to social engineer their way
[00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:27.040]   and do locking at you out of your digital life.
[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:30.360]   That's bad.
[00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:33.000]   Whether that was a failure between the keyboard
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.080]   and the chair by whoever was answering the phone
[00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:39.080]   or whether that was a massive flaw in the way
[00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:40.760]   they institute the system, which I think we'll probably
[00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:42.880]   find more out in your Wired article tomorrow.
[00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:44.720]   But I can't wait.
[00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:49.200]   That scares the delete expletive out of me.
[00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:50.040]   That sucks, dude.
[00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:52.120]   And I'm sorry you went through this.
[00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:53.520]   I've for a long time--
[00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:55.400]   I wrote a few pieces about this for just a moment ago.
[00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:58.320]   But I really feel like password systems in general--
[00:20:58.320 --> 00:20:59.800]   I mean, passwords are just a broken system.
[00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:01.760]   I mean, just using passwords or a terrible system.
[00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:03.440]   I know there are a lot of smart people working
[00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:04.800]   on other options.
[00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:05.720]   We don't have them yet.
[00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:07.560]   And the ultimate failure point here
[00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:09.520]   was this temporary password that was issued.
[00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:10.640]   And I just--
[00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:12.760]   I mean, this is reinforced every bad feeling
[00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:16.360]   I have about our password-based authentication systems.
[00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:17.440]   What would you suggest?
[00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:18.840]   I mean, eyeballs or what?
[00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:19.560]   I'm curious.
[00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:21.080]   I think what are the solutions?
[00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:21.560]   I don't know.
[00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:23.920]   I mean, I think there might be some browser-based solutions
[00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:24.960]   for web logins.
[00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:28.120]   But generally speaking, I don't know.
[00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:29.600]   And I've talked to people in the US government
[00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:31.440]   about that even.
[00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:34.520]   I know that the president has actually
[00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:36.440]   set up a special office where they're looking at it,
[00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:38.200]   sort of working on next generation password things.
[00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:41.800]   But one of the big problems is that Microsoft is working on one
[00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:43.400]   thing, and Google is working on another,
[00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:45.120]   and Apple is working on another, and Facebook's
[00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:45.800]   working on another.
[00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:50.820]   And everybody sort of has a vested interest in being identity
[00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:51.960]   providers.
[00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:58.120]   And that means that you don't get some sort of top-down standard.
[00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:01.040]   It's really important, too, as we start doing virtual money
[00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:01.800]   and things like that.
[00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:05.480]   Because really, all of financial transaction is about
[00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:07.320]   is authenticating the two parties.
[00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:11.200]   And if you don't have good authentication systems,
[00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:13.000]   and we aren't moving full speed ahead
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.680]   towards digital financial transfers.
[00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:19.960]   And all due respect to any PayPal employees in the audience,
[00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:23.800]   we all know that with large multinational banks make a mistake,
[00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:25.040]   it's your fault.
[00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:25.400]   Yeah.
[00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:27.520]   We're going to lock you out of your account forever.
[00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:29.240]   I like to say good fact your authentication.
[00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:30.720]   I think that's a good start.
[00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:35.520]   And I think sending a four-digit passcode to a cell phone,
[00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:38.360]   one-time use, or having something like Google Authenticator
[00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:42.280]   or the Blizzard Authenticator give you these rotating numbers.
[00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:44.480]   I think that's a pretty good start.
[00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:45.360]   I'm going all cash.
[00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:47.720]   You'd have to steal my phone and steal my password.
[00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:49.640]   I'm going straight barter from here on out.
[00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:50.680]   Matt, we're going to let you go.
[00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:51.200]   Thank you.
[00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:51.880]   Matt, hold on.
[00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:53.360]   I'm sorry that happened to you.
[00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:56.680]   If you're going all cash, I'll be at your house.
[00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:58.040]   Yeah, which is safer, right?
[00:22:58.040 --> 00:22:59.640]   Your mattress, sir, or yourself?
[00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:00.640]   Nothing is safe.
[00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:01.600]   Nothing's safe.
[00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:02.280]   There you go.
[00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:03.600]   Acceptable risk.
[00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:04.960]   It's best to own nothing.
[00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:05.880]   Thank you, Matt Honan.
[00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:06.840]   Thanks, Matt.
[00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:07.840]   Take care.
[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:08.800]   Sorry this happened to you.
[00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:10.400]   We'll look forward to the article on Wired.com.
[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:11.640]   Matt, thank you to see Total Recall.
[00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:13.040]   We can feel bad about the future.
[00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:14.960]   Did you see that yet, Kara?
[00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:15.440]   Is it good?
[00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:18.160]   No, I wanted to last night, and I had some work I had to do,
[00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:19.520]   but I want to.
[00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:20.480]   I love the first one.
[00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:21.280]   I first second one.
[00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:23.640]   Not as good, but I love that first one.
[00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:25.640]   You can't rent the first one, which really annoys me.
[00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:28.040]   So I spent 20 bucks, and I bought it on iTunes.
[00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:29.120]   Oh, really?
[00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:32.120]   You can't rent anything you want to see before a major movie
[00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:32.640]   release.
[00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:33.080]   They're smart.
[00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:35.040]   There must be paying attention.
[00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:36.760]   But it's actually a very dated film.
[00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:37.480]   It's funny.
[00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:39.840]   It feels like an old '70s cop show.
[00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:41.480]   Yeah, it's fantastic.
[00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:42.640]   It's still a great movie.
[00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:45.600]   Paul Verhoeven is awesome, and that was very much him.
[00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:47.600]   And the height of his--
[00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:48.080]   Howers?
[00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:48.600]   --is mad genius.
[00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:49.080]   It's very fun.
[00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:49.840]   It's very fun.
[00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:51.520]   But I heard this one isn't as good.
[00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:54.480]   You'll wish you'll have more hands to give the finger
[00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:56.200]   to the screen, because it's not particularly good.
[00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:56.680]   I don't care.
[00:23:56.680 --> 00:23:57.680]   I'm going to go.
[00:23:57.680 --> 00:23:58.920]   I don't care.
[00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:00.920]   Does it just see Batman, Kara?
[00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:01.920]   I didn't.
[00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:02.420]   I didn't.
[00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:03.400]   I don't-- I don't-- I'm not a Batman.
[00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:05.200]   My kids watch Batman Begins last night.
[00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:06.680]   I just-- I'm not a big Batman fan.
[00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:07.840]   I did like The Avengers, though.
[00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:09.320]   I'm a big sci-fi fan.
[00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:10.520]   But I don't know why I didn't see this one.
[00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:11.400]   I think-- you know what?
[00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:12.120]   I'm realized this.
[00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:14.000]   There's Marvel people, and there's DC people.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.280]   And there's a very difference.
[00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:17.680]   It's like men are from Mars, women are from Venus.
[00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:18.640]   Well, now it's like--
[00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:20.000]   I was born in a G.C.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:20.920]   Now it's pop culture.
[00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:21.920]   Like, now it's--
[00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:22.920]   Yeah.
[00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:23.760]   So, so, do you ever--
[00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:24.760]   So, do you ever--
[00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:25.440]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:25.960]   Me too.
[00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:27.960]   Batman, Green Lantern, the whole bit.
[00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:28.960]   That's it.
[00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:30.960]   And these Marvel guys, they feel like kindergarten characters.
[00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:31.960]   Marvel.
[00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:32.960]   They feel like Fisher Price characters.
[00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:33.960]   Spider-Man was great.
[00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:34.960]   That was a great film.
[00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:35.960]   I love Spider-Man.
[00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:36.960]   I love all these.
[00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:37.960]   I'm a Marvel--
[00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:38.960]   See?
[00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:39.960]   --make mine Marvel.
[00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:40.960]   See?
[00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:41.960]   I'm telling you.
[00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:42.960]   There's-- Patrick, you want to weigh in?
[00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:43.960]   It's the Batman.
[00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:47.960]   My favorite comic book character is The Midnight Earth.
[00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:48.960]   And it goes downhill from there.
[00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:50.960]   Yes, and he's already some indie crap, some weird indie crap.
[00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:51.960]   I knew it.
[00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:53.960]   Batman is so depressed.
[00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:54.960]   It's just like--
[00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:55.960]   He is.
[00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:59.960]   In fact, that whole series, the Chris Nolan series is creepy.
[00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:00.960]   It really is creepy.
[00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:01.960]   It really is creepy.
[00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:02.960]   It's creepy.
[00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:07.960]   An angry adult male with a bazillion dollars spending his life learning every possible
[00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:08.960]   Marsha--
[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:09.960]   Dude, they're all wearing their pajamas.
[00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:10.960]   It's all but stupid.
[00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:11.960]   No, they're not.
[00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:12.960]   They're not all stupid.
[00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:14.960]   They're wonderful commentaries on the human condition.
[00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:15.960]   No, the Frank Miller one.
[00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:17.960]   There's seven defensive responses to this attack.
[00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:18.960]   Yeah.
[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:19.960]   Three of them, you know, incapacitate.
[00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:20.960]   That's good stuff.
[00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:21.960]   Four of them kill.
[00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:22.960]   One of them hurts.
[00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:25.960]   And you hear this like, of course, the next sploosh in the crunchy noise.
[00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:28.720]   And Batman's about just being pissed off at the universe.
[00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:31.520]   That's why I like Batman because it's psychologically complex.
[00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:33.960]   It's not some guy dressed up in a crazy--
[00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:34.960]   It's not Superman.
[00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:35.960]   Spider-Man's.
[00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:36.960]   They're making super man-like.
[00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:37.960]   The new Superman looks good.
[00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:38.960]   The new Superman looks good.
[00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:39.960]   That trailer was stupid.
[00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:40.960]   You didn't like that trailer?
[00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:42.960]   I couldn't figure out why they were on a fishing boat.
[00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:43.960]   Yeah.
[00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:44.960]   It was like a perfect storm meets Superman.
[00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:45.960]   I didn't really understand that.
[00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:46.960]   It looked like a 90 hit.
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:47.960]   It's so bad.
[00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:48.960]   It was just depressing.
[00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:50.960]   All right, now we have to generate it into boyville.
[00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:51.960]   I have two small kids.
[00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:52.960]   So I can't--
[00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:53.960]   All right, we're going to break.
[00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:54.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:55.960]   And we'll come back.
[00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:57.960]   And we'll actually talk about the tech news.
[00:25:57.960 --> 00:25:58.960]   How about that?
[00:25:58.960 --> 00:25:59.960]   There's some big stories.
[00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:00.960]   And we've got a great team in fact.
[00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:01.960]   Kara, I hope you don't mind.
[00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:03.960]   But I'd like to revisit Yahoo because you know more.
[00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:04.960]   Hell, right.
[00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:06.960]   You know more about what's going on inside Yahoo than any human.
[00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:07.960]   I've got you one coming out soon.
[00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:08.960]   I got a good one.
[00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:09.960]   I got a little--
[00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:10.960]   Oh, see, see, see.
[00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:11.960]   Nice.
[00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:14.960]   Kara is a sly cove, though, because we've had you on the show when you've had scoops and
[00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:15.960]   you've sat on them.
[00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:16.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:17.960]   You've known stuff.
[00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:18.960]   I don't know.
[00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:23.960]   I just haven't finished them.
[00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:24.960]   Poor for legal support.
[00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:26.960]   I work for all things too.
[00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:27.960]   Oh, that's right.
[00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:29.960]   I don't give you any money, do I?
[00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:32.960]   Yeah, but I'm going to that guy's house and getting the money.
[00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:34.960]   Yeah, he stores it as mattress.
[00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:35.960]   Jerry stores it as mattress.
[00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:39.960]   We're going to talk for a brief moment about our friends at Citrix who do remote access.
[00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:46.960]   And by the way, secure SSL, there has never been an exploit using Go to My PC.
[00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:49.960]   And I can't say that about most of the-- yeah, knock on wood.
[00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:50.960]   I probably shouldn't say that.
[00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:51.960]   It's better calling going to town.
[00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:52.960]   Don't say that.
[00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:56.960]   But no, seriously, there's been plenty of exploits with many other remote access products, but
[00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:57.960]   never with Go to My PC.
[00:26:57.960 --> 00:26:58.960]   And that's because these guys do it right.
[00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:01.960]   It's uses NAT traversal, uses SSL.
[00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:06.960]   You don't have to punch a hole in your firewall that eliminates a whole category of security issues.
[00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:09.960]   If you've not used Go to My PC, this is a great time to try it.
[00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:10.960]   Hey, it's vacation time.
[00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:11.960]   Kids are out of school.
[00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:12.960]   You weather's great.
[00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:13.960]   You want to go to the pool.
[00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:15.960]   You don't want to be at work.
[00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:16.960]   Leave.
[00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:20.960]   But before you do, get on your Mac or your PC, install Go to My PC.
[00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:22.960]   You could do it free for 30 days.
[00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:27.960]   And then take your iPad or even your iPhone with you, and you can access that office computer
[00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:29.960]   and do anything you could do if you were at work.
[00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:32.960]   You could send and receive email, run a program, access any network resource.
[00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:34.960]   It's all there.
[00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:39.960]   And on these random displays, I have to say, sometimes your iPad has more resolution than
[00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:41.960]   your computer at work.

[00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:04.920]   You could trust them.
[00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:06.240]   And I use them all the time.
[00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:10.000]   Hey, a note, we are doing a Mars landing special tonight's the night we were talking before
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   the show.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   I'm excited.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   Oh, it's going to be a big deal.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   It's going to be awesome.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:14.920]   Thank you.
[00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:15.920]   Wow.
[00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:20.080]   Kara, it feels like the younger generation is into space.
[00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:23.000]   Like I mean, I watched Cronkite, watched Apollo.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   You're younger than me.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.160]   But I mean, it just seems like the younger generation.
[00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:27.160]   What?
[00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:28.160]   You guys don't know.
[00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:29.160]   I'm not the younger generation.
[00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:30.160]   So I don't know what to say.
[00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:31.160]   What's what I'm saying?
[00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:32.160]   Is that you love space, right?
[00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:33.160]   No, no, not really.
[00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:34.160]   Oh, that's right.
[00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:35.160]   You work for Walt.
[00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:36.160]   Megan loves it.
[00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:37.160]   She's awesome.
[00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:38.160]   She went to space camp.
[00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:39.160]   Megan did so.
[00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:40.160]   That's right.
[00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:41.160]   You told us that.
[00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:42.160]   Yeah.
[00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:43.160]   She's like an astronaut.
[00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:47.240]   She's a super young guy and a pyro midi are and Elon Musk.
[00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:48.240]   They all went together.
[00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:49.240]   Wait a minute.
[00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:51.540]   They all went to a space camp together like a special.
[00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:52.540]   Yeah, in Alabama.
[00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:53.540]   Years ago.
[00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:55.520]   Yeah, space camp in Huntsville.
[00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:56.520]   Wow.
[00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:58.440]   Did they actually have a launch?
[00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:01.160]   They had suits and everything that was very nerdy.
[00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:02.520]   It was like super nerdy.
[00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:04.660]   I think they did all kinds of space campy things.
[00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:05.660]   I don't know.
[00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:08.000]   I drank Tang and like, you know, had Velcro fights.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.440]   Yeah, I think they were they had a little mission.
[00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:11.960]   It wasn't real, but I think they had.
[00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:12.960]   I don't know.
[00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:14.400]   I didn't actually go to space.
[00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:16.080]   There was enough money among the six of them.
[00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:18.120]   They probably could have launched something in the space.
[00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:19.760]   You know, on Musk is, right?
[00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:21.840]   They're going to Ritz Carlton near in Huntsville.
[00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:25.080]   I wasn't going, so I don't know.
[00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:26.080]   Standards.
[00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:27.080]   She doesn't like space.
[00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:28.280]   We will do live coverage.
[00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:31.440]   The curiosity after it's how long has it been flying?
[00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:32.440]   It's 18 months.
[00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:33.440]   I'm like, you know, Patrick.
[00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:36.080]   You know, actually, seven years.
[00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:37.960]   They launched that seven years ago.
[00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:38.960]   Yeah.
[00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:39.960]   Wow.
[00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:42.920]   Well, it's been in the making for seven.
[00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:44.920]   Seven years, but it's been flying for nothing.
[00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:48.960]   The chalom says anything from three years to eight months somewhere in there.
[00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:49.960]   Yes.
[00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:50.960]   Something like that.
[00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:51.960]   A long time.
[00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:52.960]   Eight and a half.
[00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:53.960]   I think it's amazing.
[00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:55.320]   It is amazing and the stuff they're going to bring back is amazing.
[00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:56.400]   I just don't have it.
[00:29:56.400 --> 00:30:00.480]   You know, it's I'm going to bring back so much important data for one of the things they're
[00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:02.440]   looking for is evidence of life.
[00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:05.080]   I can't decide if I want to wake my son up tonight.
[00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:07.400]   So he can witness it.
[00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:08.800]   Well he also might be like, what was that?
[00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:09.800]   Huh?
[00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:10.800]   And then fall back asleep.
[00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:11.800]   Doesn't matter.
[00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:12.800]   Doesn't matter.
[00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:13.800]   That's the one that he wants.
[00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:14.800]   He's going to be a great leader.
[00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:15.800]   He wants it to home run in the world series.
[00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:16.800]   He'll never remember it, but he was there.
[00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:17.800]   He was there.
[00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:18.800]   That's all that matters.
[00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:22.560]   And then he can tell his grandkids, I got up in the middle of the night with daddy and
[00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:23.560]   then we watch something.
[00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:24.560]   I don't.
[00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:27.440]   Well, you can just make sure that you put on the twit coverage tonight.
[00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:28.440]   Here comes the plug.
[00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:29.440]   There you go.
[00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:30.440]   10 damn Pacific.
[00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:31.440]   Hosts by Tom Merritt.
[00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:32.440]   Phil Plait.
[00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:33.440]   The Batastronomer.
[00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:34.440]   Yeah.
[00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:35.440]   Yeah.
[00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:36.440]   The Batastronomer who is fantastic.
[00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:38.380]   The best in the business in terms of describing space.
[00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:39.380]   So bad.
[00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:40.380]   He's good.
[00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:41.380]   He is.
[00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:42.380]   He's better than bad.
[00:30:42.380 --> 00:30:46.480]   We have a 20 minute interview with Steve Sell on the entry, descent and landing the
[00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:49.920]   EDL, which is that seven minutes of terror that we've been talking about.
[00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:51.920]   Can Yahoo be fixed?
[00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:53.440]   Let's ask Cara Swisher.
[00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:58.440]   So Cara, you have always had this inside track into memos.
[00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:00.880]   You know what's going on in Yahoo.
[00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:03.880]   Were you surprised when Marissa Meyer took the CEO job?
[00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:08.200]   You know, I, you know, on that Sunday I was given a tip that it was her and I just couldn't
[00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:10.200]   get another source on it, which was interesting.
[00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:12.420]   I thought, wow, that's a great idea.
[00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:14.700]   I happen to be on a plane when they announced it the next day.
[00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:17.340]   But, you know, it was a good idea.
[00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:21.440]   I think it came out of a little bit out of left field, but it was kind of an obvious
[00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:23.340]   choice if you started to think about it.
[00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:24.340]   Do you think it was?
[00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:27.020]   Do you think it was the board?
[00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:28.020]   Yes.
[00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:30.340]   It was their idea.
[00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:34.140]   It was Dan Loeb and Michael Wolff on the board.
[00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:36.220]   Dan Loeb, mostly driving most of it.
[00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:41.640]   He'd spent a lot of time out here recently and I think between him Michael Wolff and David
[00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:43.600]   Kenney, that was how it was done.
[00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:44.600]   It was probably that.
[00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:49.240]   Dan was the dissident investor who was very unhappy with how Yahoo was going.
[00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:50.240]   Yes.
[00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:51.240]   Got a seat on the board.
[00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:52.240]   Sit three, actually.
[00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:53.840]   Three seats on the board.
[00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:54.840]   Yeah.
[00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:58.680]   And so he kind of, now did they make the call to Marissa and what was it?
[00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:01.840]   Do you think that talk that convinced Marissa to take the job?
[00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:03.720]   Oh, I think she was looking to leave Google.
[00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:04.720]   I think there was.
[00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:09.620]   I think there was, I've been following a number of stories of her looking at a bunch of VC
[00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:11.860]   firms and other places.
[00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:15.100]   I think she was starting to look around.
[00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:20.260]   She hadn't gotten promoted in that last Larry round and I think probably the people in place
[00:32:20.260 --> 00:32:25.900]   were in place and so probably she was looking for a bigger challenge for herself probably.
[00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:30.540]   It felt like a little bit of a snub when she wasn't chosen as one of the five big.
[00:32:30.540 --> 00:32:33.540]   Seven or eight or seven, whoever running the.
[00:32:33.540 --> 00:32:36.280]   And she got moved from search to social local.
[00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:37.280]   Yeah.
[00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:38.280]   Yeah.
[00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:39.280]   It wasn't down really.
[00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:40.280]   It just wasn't up.
[00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:44.000]   And so I think that probably in the people in place are rather young and very vigorous
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:48.040]   and not, you know, it's there's only so much room at the top once you start to go to the,
[00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:49.240]   you know, when you start to do that.
[00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:52.920]   And so I suspect she was looking for something bigger and this is bigger.
[00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:57.160]   This is a chance to really show her management skills or, you know, it's a real challenge
[00:32:57.160 --> 00:32:58.320]   for her.
[00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:02.320]   So that's probably was very appealing to her, I would guess.
[00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:04.900]   It's a risk.
[00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:08.020]   It is, I think it's the biggest challenge of any tech business.
[00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:11.020]   Well, you could, you could say rim would be a bigger challenge.
[00:33:11.020 --> 00:33:18.500]   Well, but at least rim has, they have a business had right now and I don't know.
[00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:21.860]   I can't really say if you ask me, what is Yahoo's business?
[00:33:21.860 --> 00:33:22.860]   I don't know.
[00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:23.860]   I don't know what it is.
[00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:24.860]   It's a big business.
[00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:25.860]   That's not absolutely true.
[00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:27.360]   It's very profitable.
[00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:28.980]   It's not as profitable as it was.
[00:33:28.980 --> 00:33:33.360]   It's not as growing as it was, but it's good God doing better than most startups that are
[00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:35.860]   selling for a billion dollars doing well.
[00:33:35.860 --> 00:33:38.160]   They have, they have a whole bunch of different.
[00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:45.440]   I mean, I mean, but so does General Electric, but that's why that's why it's interesting
[00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:50.680]   because there's value, but it's, it's, you've got to figure out some way to capitalize
[00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:51.680]   on it.
[00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:57.040]   One, what a lot of people said is that she needs to make a decision between being a content
[00:33:57.040 --> 00:33:59.660]   company or a web services company.
[00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:01.380]   I think the second is what she'll do.
[00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:02.860]   I think there's no question.
[00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:06.620]   She's going to, she's going to double down on advertising tech, I think, and which is
[00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:11.100]   a completely opposite direction for what Ross Levinson was going to do, the proposal
[00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:12.860]   he made to the board.
[00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:15.340]   She was, she's going to expand and compete with Google.
[00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:20.360]   I mean, they had, they were very close to a deal with Google to a sort of offload ad
[00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:22.980]   tech to them or they were talking to Microsoft.
[00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:26.180]   And so I think what's interesting is that I don't think she's going to do that.
[00:34:26.180 --> 00:34:29.780]   I think she's going to try to build it up herself and see if she can compete in other
[00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:33.280]   ways and differentiating ways presumably because it's going straight at Google.
[00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:37.580]   It's kind of a loser, proposition for anybody at this moment.
[00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:39.640]   But you know, she knows Google and signing out.
[00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:43.380]   So she could, she certainly was not as involved in that part of the business, the ad business
[00:34:43.380 --> 00:34:49.000]   that Susan Wojcie and others, but she certainly has a familiarity with the company.
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:55.980]   So, and when, when Microsoft and Yahoo made the deal, Microsoft being became Yahoo's search
[00:34:55.980 --> 00:35:00.940]   engine, but Yahoo, as I remember it, correct me if I'm wrong, continued to run the ad business,
[00:35:00.940 --> 00:35:01.940]   right, Dad?
[00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:02.940]   Isn't that how it worked?
[00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:03.940]   I believe that's right.
[00:35:03.940 --> 00:35:04.940]   Yes.
[00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:07.020]   So, so they are well positioned to be an ad company.
[00:35:07.020 --> 00:35:08.540]   Well, they are one.
[00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:09.540]   They are an ad.
[00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:10.540]   It's ad tech.
[00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:11.540]   It's whether they're going to do the serving.
[00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:17.140]   And you know, Google essentially is, is, is, is, is, has the most powerful ad serving
[00:35:17.140 --> 00:35:18.740]   technology around now.
[00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:21.500]   And so the question Yahoo used to, but doesn't anymore.
[00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:25.900]   So it's a lot of investment she's going to have to make to make it so a lot.
[00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:33.300]   So like Google, they may offer some services like Flickr or Yahoo Finance, but really they're,
[00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:38.780]   the backbone of the company is the ads they serve on their sites and other sites.
[00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:39.780]   Yes, yes.
[00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:40.780]   Third part of the site.
[00:35:40.780 --> 00:35:41.780]   Yes, yes.
[00:35:41.780 --> 00:35:42.780]   Part of it.
[00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:44.740]   But a lot of it is premium ad sales, you know, on their major content sites like Yahoo
[00:35:44.740 --> 00:35:45.740]   Finance, the home pay.
[00:35:45.740 --> 00:35:48.340]   They have three businesses and it's just the way it is.
[00:35:48.340 --> 00:35:51.620]   It's, they've got search, which has been a big money maker for them.
[00:35:51.620 --> 00:35:55.540]   And now they've got guaranteed income from Microsoft through that deal, even though it's
[00:35:55.540 --> 00:35:57.780]   not performing well, they have a guaranteed deal.
[00:35:57.780 --> 00:36:01.180]   The second thing is the home page, which makes, that's where they make most of their
[00:36:01.180 --> 00:36:02.180]   money.
[00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:03.740]   People go to Yahoo.com.
[00:36:03.740 --> 00:36:05.420]   They make a lot of money on that home page.
[00:36:05.420 --> 00:36:07.540]   Yes, there's 700 million people go through there a month.
[00:36:07.540 --> 00:36:08.940]   That's a lot of people.
[00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:11.980]   And then thirdly through mail, they make quite a bit of money through their mail, but it's
[00:36:11.980 --> 00:36:12.980]   declining.
[00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:15.180]   They're both the search and the mail are declining.
[00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:16.180]   And so is home page.
[00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:21.020]   And so that's really the problem is can they make new services that are so compelling that
[00:36:21.020 --> 00:36:23.060]   advertisers want to be on them?
[00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:24.060]   And that's hard.
[00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:28.220]   I mean, there's, there's not a magical unicorn and a lot of the innovations going on at
[00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:29.220]   startups.
[00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:31.060]   And so can she bring that into Yahoo?
[00:36:31.060 --> 00:36:35.900]   She's certainly an exciting choice to a lot of people and certainly at Yahoo.
[00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:36.900]   She is.
[00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:41.260]   I mean, she gave away free food, which was like, that story went crazy, except I tried to
[00:36:41.260 --> 00:36:44.140]   point out, by the way, every web company gives away free food.
[00:36:44.140 --> 00:36:45.140]   Yahoo was the one that's--
[00:36:45.140 --> 00:36:46.140]   We give away free food for credit.
[00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:47.140]   But they went crazy.
[00:36:47.140 --> 00:36:49.140]   They went crazy at Yahoo.
[00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:52.020]   And I kept pointing out to them, like, you know, everyone else gets it already.
[00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:53.020]   You're getting some things.
[00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:54.700]   But, you know, they didn't have it.
[00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:57.780]   And, you know, this week, I'll be writing about what she's done this week.
[00:36:57.780 --> 00:37:01.780]   But she's, you know, she's doing things that other web companies had been doing.
[00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:05.300]   And they hadn't-- Yahoo's like caught in a time warp or something that didn't get these
[00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:06.300]   things.
[00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:07.300]   And so we'll see how--
[00:37:07.300 --> 00:37:09.180]   But those are superficial, Kara.
[00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:10.180]   Yes, absolutely.
[00:37:10.180 --> 00:37:11.180]   Yes.
[00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:13.140]   But they're about cultural change that this is-- we're back in the business.
[00:37:13.140 --> 00:37:15.180]   A new era for, for, for, for, for, yeah.
[00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:17.220]   Oh, Kara, can I ask you this?
[00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:19.980]   You said that she was looking to leave.
[00:37:19.980 --> 00:37:26.380]   Do you get the sense from talking to principal people in this move that there is any bad
[00:37:26.380 --> 00:37:32.860]   blood or that sticking it to Google is part of the challenge for Marissa?
[00:37:32.860 --> 00:37:33.860]   No.
[00:37:33.860 --> 00:37:35.260]   No, I don't think it was bad blood.
[00:37:35.260 --> 00:37:38.540]   I just think she, you know, it just-- there's 10 people that start together.
[00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:39.540]   Eight get promoted.
[00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:40.540]   And you don't.
[00:37:40.540 --> 00:37:41.540]   Whatever.
[00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:42.540]   It happens all the time.
[00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:43.540]   It's nothing.
[00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:44.540]   That's nothing.
[00:37:44.540 --> 00:37:45.540]   I don't think there was bad blood.
[00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:46.540]   I think she, you know, she had some challenges there.
[00:37:46.540 --> 00:37:48.900]   You could say that about any executive at Google, you know what I mean?
[00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:51.700]   Like every one of them has their pulses and minuses.
[00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:54.180]   So I think it's not like I'm going to get them.
[00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:56.540]   It's just-- I don't think that's not her personality.
[00:37:56.540 --> 00:37:59.100]   That would feel good though if she did get them.
[00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:00.100]   Well, then-- and then--
[00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:01.580]   There's no getting Google.
[00:38:01.580 --> 00:38:03.580]   I mean, I don't know.
[00:38:03.580 --> 00:38:05.620]   There is-- it does raise the question though.
[00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:08.620]   I mean, there's two-- there's two ways it seems that she could go.
[00:38:08.620 --> 00:38:13.540]   She could, you know, Yahoo's already in partnership with Facebook and Microsoft.
[00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:14.540]   Yeah.
[00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:22.220]   And she could kind of create a-- I always say access, but it could be the allies.
[00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:25.980]   But she could create the allies against Google.
[00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:26.980]   Yes.
[00:38:26.980 --> 00:38:31.660]   Microsoft, Yahoo, Apple, Facebook versus Google.
[00:38:31.660 --> 00:38:32.860]   Or she could partner with Google.
[00:38:32.860 --> 00:38:37.380]   I mean, the same kinds of partnership she's doing right now with Microsoft, she could instead
[00:38:37.380 --> 00:38:38.380]   do with Google.
[00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:39.380]   She has inside knowledge.
[00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:41.060]   She knows people at Google.
[00:38:41.060 --> 00:38:42.740]   Do you think she'll choose one of those two paths?
[00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:43.740]   Or if she--
[00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:47.860]   I mean, the search one is interesting because, you know, they have this deal with Microsoft.
[00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:52.020]   And, you know, Microsoft has failed at a number of performance metrics from what I understand.
[00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:54.180]   And so they certainly could move it over to Google.
[00:38:54.180 --> 00:38:57.620]   In that case, there's some regulatory issues, which I think Google's aware of.
[00:38:57.620 --> 00:39:01.620]   And they're aware about Google owning pretty much all of search around the world.
[00:39:01.620 --> 00:39:03.100]   So that's problematic.
[00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:07.100]   Google needs Microsoft like Microsoft needed Apple for many years.
[00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:08.100]   Right.
[00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:10.060]   I think Yahoo going with Google would be a tough row.
[00:39:10.060 --> 00:39:14.020]   I think everyone will get their backs up in search, especially.
[00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:16.860]   In ad serving, there are a number of different ad serving things.
[00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:20.140]   Nonetheless, Google does dominate that area again.
[00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:22.860]   But they don't dominate it like they do search, I think.
[00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:23.860]   So it's a question.
[00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:25.300]   She has a lot of choices.
[00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:27.540]   And certainly, people want Yahoo to succeed.
[00:39:27.540 --> 00:39:31.660]   I think that's one of the parts that is-- it's just a question of whether they can make
[00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:33.660]   great products that people want to use.
[00:39:33.660 --> 00:39:37.940]   And they really haven't done-- that's really at the heart of what the problem is, is they
[00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:41.580]   have not made-- they've missed pretty much every single trend.
[00:39:41.580 --> 00:39:45.660]   Like, a Pinterest would be a very Yahoo-like thing to have done.
[00:39:45.660 --> 00:39:48.340]   So was Instagram.
[00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:49.340]   They had Flickr.
[00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:52.580]   I mean, so it just goes on and on and on about things they didn't take.
[00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:57.420]   And so the question is, will she be able to inspire, bring in engineers in that can create
[00:39:57.420 --> 00:39:58.420]   things?
[00:39:58.420 --> 00:39:59.620]   Or are those people very happy at startups?
[00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:01.780]   And that's the difficult part for her.
[00:40:01.780 --> 00:40:04.420]   What do you think of that idea at you cover Microsoft?
[00:40:04.420 --> 00:40:09.180]   Would it be an interesting thing for Yahoo to team with Microsoft, Facebook, and Apple?
[00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:11.300]   Is it anti-Google allies?
[00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:17.180]   Well, I think Microsoft is feeling pretty glum about that prospect.
[00:40:17.180 --> 00:40:19.740]   Now, they-- I think they feel like they dodged a bullet.
[00:40:19.740 --> 00:40:20.740]   Didn't they try to buy?
[00:40:20.740 --> 00:40:21.740]   What was it?
[00:40:21.740 --> 00:40:22.740]   $31 billion?
[00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:25.700]   $31 billion they would have paid for Yahoo.
[00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:30.340]   And that would have made the-- the a-quantive write down look like this.
[00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:32.820]   That was a mere 6.2 billion.
[00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:33.820]   Right.
[00:40:33.820 --> 00:40:41.500]   So I think any kind of tie up with Yahoo beyond what they've got right now would be a really,
[00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:42.900]   really difficult sell.
[00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:43.900]   I agree.
[00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:44.900]   I agree.
[00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:48.420]   I think they're-- I think they haven't been able to make the search partnership work.
[00:40:48.420 --> 00:40:49.420]   Right.
[00:40:49.420 --> 00:40:51.300]   And that's-- there's all kinds of reasons for that.
[00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:56.820]   They've been spending what I think at $750 million losses in that online services division
[00:40:56.820 --> 00:40:57.820]   every quarter.
[00:40:57.820 --> 00:40:58.820]   That's $750 million.
[00:40:58.820 --> 00:40:59.820]   Yeah, that's a lot.
[00:40:59.820 --> 00:41:06.740]   Yeah, but now you can argue, though, that Microsoft has a need to take that money and
[00:41:06.740 --> 00:41:12.420]   treat it as an investment, not as a defensive play.
[00:41:12.420 --> 00:41:16.460]   They can't afford to live in a world where they don't control search on their devices
[00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:19.780]   and where they're at the mercy of Google or someone else.
[00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:20.780]   Right.
[00:41:20.780 --> 00:41:24.980]   You know, the new devices, phones and tablets and stuff have to have robust search built
[00:41:24.980 --> 00:41:26.780]   into them.
[00:41:26.780 --> 00:41:32.260]   And if you have a new device platform coming out and you have to depend on Google for
[00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:34.620]   it, you're in a very, very weak position.
[00:41:34.620 --> 00:41:41.900]   So in that sense, the money that they spend in Bing is sort of reinforcing a core aspect
[00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:44.220]   of the Windows mobile platforms for them.
[00:41:44.220 --> 00:41:45.220]   Yes, absolutely.
[00:41:45.220 --> 00:41:46.220]   I think they can't not be.
[00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:48.420]   And it is just a very pricey investment for them.
[00:41:48.420 --> 00:41:52.620]   And I think losing Yahoo would be something-- I don't think they want that to happen,
[00:41:52.620 --> 00:41:56.540]   although they still haven't fixed the problem with the-- and then those guarantees do
[00:41:56.540 --> 00:41:57.900]   run out at some point.
[00:41:57.900 --> 00:42:01.580]   So Yahoo's got to think about what it wants to do.
[00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:02.580]   It's very interesting.
[00:42:02.580 --> 00:42:03.580]   And you're right, Karra.
[00:42:03.580 --> 00:42:05.780]   I think we're all rooting for Yahoo.
[00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:08.380]   Because they were an internet pioneer, we all have fond memories of them.
[00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:11.060]   But also, it's good to have some competition for Google.
[00:42:11.060 --> 00:42:13.420]   I want them to take back that old Navy billboard.
[00:42:13.420 --> 00:42:14.860]   Because that old Navy billboard.
[00:42:14.860 --> 00:42:16.380]   That was so stupid.
[00:42:16.380 --> 00:42:20.300]   Only San Franciscans know about this, but there was a beautiful Yahoo.
[00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:21.300]   No.
[00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:24.340]   All incandescent light bulb billboard and Yahoo.
[00:42:24.340 --> 00:42:27.180]   And an old Navy took it over and then they put on this LED screen that just says dumb
[00:42:27.180 --> 00:42:29.140]   one-liners when I'm going home to Oakland.
[00:42:29.140 --> 00:42:30.940]   Let me see if I can find it.
[00:42:30.940 --> 00:42:33.740]   That's what all went wrong was the billboard.
[00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:34.740]   Exactly.
[00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:39.260]   Let me ask you and Ed, one more thing.
[00:42:39.260 --> 00:42:42.860]   From a consumer end, I mean, I know for me following these kind of things, it very much
[00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:48.500]   seemed that with Marissa coming in that Yahoo was overnight looked that differently than
[00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:53.100]   what it was before, that it was a possibility that it could be again a company that was
[00:42:53.100 --> 00:42:55.580]   on the rise from its current trajectory.
[00:42:55.580 --> 00:43:00.980]   From you guys talking to your sources, is that the same inside the tech community, people
[00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:05.260]   that are making decisions that also just are informed and running businesses?
[00:43:05.260 --> 00:43:09.180]   Is that the same idea that it is for me on the consumer level?
[00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:11.740]   Well, everybody loves one of these stories.
[00:43:11.740 --> 00:43:15.940]   You know, this sort of young, exciting computer scientist who happens to be a woman too and
[00:43:15.940 --> 00:43:18.220]   a very interesting person comes in.
[00:43:18.220 --> 00:43:20.540]   And so they like these stories.
[00:43:20.540 --> 00:43:23.860]   I think it's a bigger job than that, but it's certainly an exciting story.
[00:43:23.860 --> 00:43:28.300]   And so it adds a little bit of excitement to the situation.
[00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:30.660]   I think that within Yahoo, they're thrilled.
[00:43:30.660 --> 00:43:32.300]   The techies are at least.
[00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:33.300]   They're thrilled with her.
[00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:35.540]   They think it's fantastic that someone is...
[00:43:35.540 --> 00:43:39.100]   Well, you have like, if somebody was an actual engineering degree running a company...
[00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:40.100]   Yes, the real one.
[00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:43.420]   What's interesting is that if you think about it, she is the first executive who was an
[00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:48.420]   Internet executive running this company, who's an actual native born Internet executive.
[00:43:48.420 --> 00:43:51.140]   Because Tim Coogle, there really wasn't an Internet...
[00:43:51.140 --> 00:43:52.300]   There really wasn't...
[00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:53.300]   He was the first.
[00:43:53.300 --> 00:43:55.100]   And so he had come from other places.
[00:43:55.100 --> 00:43:57.460]   Terry Semmel was a Hollywood executive.
[00:43:57.460 --> 00:44:01.580]   Jerry was certainly an Internet executive, but again, not like her.
[00:44:01.580 --> 00:44:02.580]   You know what I mean?
[00:44:02.580 --> 00:44:03.580]   She's a native.
[00:44:03.580 --> 00:44:08.100]   This is her first job was at Google, which is really interesting if you think about it.
[00:44:08.100 --> 00:44:11.100]   Scott Thompson was from a different payment background.
[00:44:11.100 --> 00:44:17.460]   So she's really the first 100% Internet savvy executive running this company.
[00:44:17.460 --> 00:44:18.460]   So that's an interesting...
[00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:20.420]   So I think about that a lot.
[00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:21.420]   We'll see.
[00:44:21.420 --> 00:44:23.660]   I don't think one person can change things unless you're Steve Jobs.
[00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:25.060]   And you know what?
[00:44:25.060 --> 00:44:26.060]   She's not Steve Jobs.
[00:44:26.060 --> 00:44:27.060]   Nobody's Steve Jobs.
[00:44:27.060 --> 00:44:28.060]   So that's the problem.
[00:44:28.060 --> 00:44:30.980]   And so I think they're looking for that story to happen again.
[00:44:30.980 --> 00:44:33.060]   And I don't know if that's going to...
[00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:36.660]   I think if she's judged on that basis, she'll disappoint.
[00:44:36.660 --> 00:44:41.540]   If she's judged on getting back some level of innovation and promise there, she'll do
[00:44:41.540 --> 00:44:42.540]   well.
[00:44:42.540 --> 00:44:43.540]   We'll see.
[00:44:43.540 --> 00:44:44.540]   It's a tough job.
[00:44:44.540 --> 00:44:45.540]   Lily of me.
[00:44:45.540 --> 00:44:46.540]   She doesn't succeed.
[00:44:46.540 --> 00:44:47.540]   It's so hard.
[00:44:47.540 --> 00:44:49.700]   But if she does, it'll be a real coup.
[00:44:49.700 --> 00:44:50.700]   Somebody's informing.
[00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:51.700]   There's signs of life.
[00:44:51.700 --> 00:44:53.700]   I think if it's just signs of life, everybody will just be.
[00:44:53.700 --> 00:44:54.700]   Yeah.
[00:44:54.700 --> 00:44:57.540]   This is a $5 billion a year company that you're saying signs of life.
[00:44:57.540 --> 00:44:58.540]   Well, okay.
[00:44:58.540 --> 00:44:59.540]   You know, it's more about...
[00:44:59.540 --> 00:45:00.540]   It's difficult.
[00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:02.580]   It's got a bad reputation among...
[00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:07.100]   As an employer in Silicon Valley, you know, engineers stare at it and quake with fear.
[00:45:07.100 --> 00:45:10.820]   But it's still racking up $5 billion a year in revenue.
[00:45:10.820 --> 00:45:11.900]   Well, that.
[00:45:11.900 --> 00:45:16.060]   But that's what's unusual about Yahoo.
[00:45:16.060 --> 00:45:20.100]   Right now, you've got three major platform companies.
[00:45:20.100 --> 00:45:26.980]   You've got Apple, Google, and Microsoft, all of whom are sort of building walls and fences
[00:45:26.980 --> 00:45:30.140]   and toll gates around their platforms.
[00:45:30.140 --> 00:45:35.740]   And then you've got a gazillion startups, all of whom either want to find a little tiny
[00:45:35.740 --> 00:45:41.020]   niche within one of those, one or more of those platforms, or where their exit strategy
[00:45:41.020 --> 00:45:43.740]   is getting purchased by one of those.
[00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:51.340]   To have a company the size of Yahoo that is neither a small startup with an exit strategy
[00:45:51.340 --> 00:45:57.740]   or owns its own platform is like, you know, what's their root out of this?
[00:45:57.740 --> 00:45:58.740]   How do they grow?
[00:45:58.740 --> 00:46:00.500]   How do they become something?
[00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:04.620]   That's where I don't see much prospect of success for Yahoo.
[00:46:04.620 --> 00:46:05.620]   Yeah.
[00:46:05.620 --> 00:46:08.500]   She's talked to platform a lot internally this past couple of weeks.
[00:46:08.500 --> 00:46:09.500]   I'll tell you that.
[00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:11.140]   She's certainly said the word platform a lot.
[00:46:11.140 --> 00:46:13.140]   So, you know, I think she has...
[00:46:13.140 --> 00:46:14.140]   That's web services.
[00:46:14.140 --> 00:46:15.140]   Yeah.
[00:46:15.140 --> 00:46:18.580]   I'm not sure what she's talking about, but I mean, I think the idea is, I don't know,
[00:46:18.580 --> 00:46:20.380]   you know, I think that she's...
[00:46:20.380 --> 00:46:24.140]   Do you think much more heavily that Yahoo's got...
[00:46:24.140 --> 00:46:28.580]   Has some differentiating qualities above those other ones that I was talking about?
[00:46:28.580 --> 00:46:29.780]   So, look at this, an opportunity.
[00:46:29.780 --> 00:46:35.020]   You take Flickr, you take finance, you take sports, you give them an API, you say we're
[00:46:35.020 --> 00:46:36.020]   a platform.
[00:46:36.020 --> 00:46:37.980]   She's gonna go big into mail.
[00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:38.980]   Mail is huge.
[00:46:38.980 --> 00:46:44.260]   Yahoo Mail's number three in the market, and it's an opportunity.
[00:46:44.260 --> 00:46:47.020]   Look what Microsoft did this week with the Hotmail.
[00:46:47.020 --> 00:46:48.900]   I think she's gonna go big into mail.
[00:46:48.900 --> 00:46:49.900]   I think she is.
[00:46:49.900 --> 00:46:54.260]   There's an opportunity because the disappointment I think without Look.com was that it really
[00:46:54.260 --> 00:46:58.980]   didn't reinvent mail, and everybody is begging for a better system.
[00:46:58.980 --> 00:47:01.380]   I don't know what it is, but put some...
[00:47:01.380 --> 00:47:02.380]   She knows mail.
[00:47:02.380 --> 00:47:03.380]   She knows mail.
[00:47:03.380 --> 00:47:04.380]   She knows mail.
[00:47:04.380 --> 00:47:05.380]   She knows mail.
[00:47:05.380 --> 00:47:06.380]   She knows mail.
[00:47:06.380 --> 00:47:07.620]   Maybe there's a magic solution.
[00:47:07.620 --> 00:47:14.500]   One of the things that Microsoft did with Outlook.com this week was to try and take a
[00:47:14.500 --> 00:47:21.860]   tarnished brand, Hotmail, which may have a ton of users, but it has very little credibility
[00:47:21.860 --> 00:47:26.540]   among the people on this panel, among the people who are watching this show.
[00:47:26.540 --> 00:47:30.060]   Nobody says, "I'm gonna go out and get a new Hotmail account and use it to run my business
[00:47:30.060 --> 00:47:32.660]   working with Gmail."
[00:47:32.660 --> 00:47:37.580]   I think Yahoo has kind of the same problem, whether it's Yahoo.com.
[00:47:37.580 --> 00:47:41.060]   Mail, or Ymail, or whatever you call it.
[00:47:41.060 --> 00:47:46.220]   You've really got a brand there that doesn't have a lot of credibility in either business
[00:47:46.220 --> 00:47:49.780]   or among the tech elite.
[00:47:49.780 --> 00:47:53.500]   They may have to do something like what Microsoft is trying to do with Hotmail, which is to
[00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:59.860]   completely rebrand it and completely change the service back in, but that is really, really
[00:47:59.860 --> 00:48:01.220]   hard to do.
[00:48:01.220 --> 00:48:05.580]   The people who use Yahoo mail, when I ask people, almost everybody uses Yahoo mail, there's
[00:48:05.580 --> 00:48:06.580]   two reasons.
[00:48:06.580 --> 00:48:08.580]   They use it for their spam address.
[00:48:08.580 --> 00:48:12.460]   Everybody nodding in the audience is where they dump their spam.
[00:48:12.460 --> 00:48:17.940]   Or two, you're an AT&T customer, and Yahoo mail is what you get as an AT&T DSL customer.
[00:48:17.940 --> 00:48:19.020]   That was an old deal.
[00:48:19.020 --> 00:48:20.020]   That was a very old deal.
[00:48:20.020 --> 00:48:22.020]   Yeah, still alive.
[00:48:22.020 --> 00:48:23.020]   It's the value.
[00:48:23.020 --> 00:48:25.380]   Yeah, the only thing is it's a very good product.
[00:48:25.380 --> 00:48:27.420]   I think Walt has given it very good reason.
[00:48:27.420 --> 00:48:28.420]   I like how, Hoomay.
[00:48:28.420 --> 00:48:30.820]   Especially if you play for the Plus version.
[00:48:30.820 --> 00:48:32.660]   It's a very good product.
[00:48:32.660 --> 00:48:34.180]   It definitely needs updating.
[00:48:34.180 --> 00:48:37.740]   The question is, is mail the place to be waging the big fights?
[00:48:37.740 --> 00:48:38.740]   I don't know.
[00:48:38.740 --> 00:48:45.980]   It's just, she's been given a big, long amount of time by this board to do these things and
[00:48:45.980 --> 00:48:46.980]   spending some money.
[00:48:46.980 --> 00:48:49.620]   So I think she's not going to be thinking about Wall Street going forward.
[00:48:49.620 --> 00:48:51.460]   I think she's going to be thinking about the products.
[00:48:51.460 --> 00:48:52.460]   That's my passion.
[00:48:52.460 --> 00:48:54.300]   That's what you've got to do, at least for a while.
[00:48:54.300 --> 00:48:58.020]   Is the importance of mail the opportunities for data mining that gives them?
[00:48:58.020 --> 00:48:59.020]   Yes.
[00:48:59.020 --> 00:49:00.020]   To be able to, yeah.
[00:49:00.020 --> 00:49:01.020]   We have it.
[00:49:01.020 --> 00:49:02.020]   We haven't done.
[00:49:02.020 --> 00:49:03.700]   What are we else's?
[00:49:03.700 --> 00:49:04.900]   We don't talk about that.
[00:49:04.900 --> 00:49:06.700]   Yes, of course it is.
[00:49:06.700 --> 00:49:08.300]   Of course it is.
[00:49:08.300 --> 00:49:12.220]   The opportunity is to face, because the consumer facing opportunity is to solve the problem
[00:49:12.220 --> 00:49:13.220]   that is mail.
[00:49:13.220 --> 00:49:14.220]   Yeah.
[00:49:14.220 --> 00:49:15.220]   Email's broken badly.
[00:49:15.220 --> 00:49:16.220]   I like this.
[00:49:16.220 --> 00:49:22.220]   I don't think people know about it, but the sweep feature in Outlook.com is actually great.
[00:49:22.220 --> 00:49:23.220]   There's some nice...
[00:49:23.220 --> 00:49:26.860]   It was in Hotmail for over a year.
[00:49:26.860 --> 00:49:34.060]   And they've surfaced it in Outlook.com and made it more obvious.
[00:49:34.060 --> 00:49:35.060]   It really is.
[00:49:35.060 --> 00:49:41.780]   In fact, I was going through my old Hotmail account, which is now Outlook.com, and cleaning
[00:49:41.780 --> 00:49:42.780]   it up today.
[00:49:42.780 --> 00:49:49.340]   I was able to get rid of several hundred crud messages just sitting there in the inbox
[00:49:49.340 --> 00:49:54.900]   and simultaneously set up rules to make sure that the crud doesn't come back.
[00:49:54.900 --> 00:49:58.340]   That was pretty revelatory.
[00:49:58.340 --> 00:50:03.980]   Good luck finding it, because I know it's here somewhere in this top bar.
[00:50:03.980 --> 00:50:04.980]   And I just...
[00:50:04.980 --> 00:50:07.420]   Oh, I think you have to click an email first.
[00:50:07.420 --> 00:50:08.900]   And then you've got sweep.
[00:50:08.900 --> 00:50:10.940]   It's like finding a feature in a haystack.
[00:50:10.940 --> 00:50:13.060]   Well, but no, but you don't want that command.
[00:50:13.060 --> 00:50:18.460]   I think that interface is good, because if that command were there and you hadn't selected
[00:50:18.460 --> 00:50:21.020]   a message, well, would you get when you clicked that?
[00:50:21.020 --> 00:50:22.020]   Right.
[00:50:22.020 --> 00:50:23.020]   Right.
[00:50:23.020 --> 00:50:24.020]   Right.
[00:50:24.020 --> 00:50:26.220]   And Gmail, for me, getting a little bloaty.
[00:50:26.220 --> 00:50:30.060]   It feels like every new thing that gets added to Gmail is something that it's taken away
[00:50:30.060 --> 00:50:31.060]   from the...
[00:50:31.060 --> 00:50:34.220]   Well, it's clear that that's what Microsoft thought, because they made a video where
[00:50:34.220 --> 00:50:37.700]   they took what is obviously Gmail and started crossing off stuff.
[00:50:37.700 --> 00:50:41.220]   There's a video and said, "Hey, look at this.
[00:50:41.220 --> 00:50:44.220]   This is, of course, what they replaced on the right side.
[00:50:44.220 --> 00:50:46.460]   All those useful things, more ads."
[00:50:46.460 --> 00:50:47.460]   But...
[00:50:47.460 --> 00:50:48.460]   Yeah.
[00:50:48.460 --> 00:50:56.140]   Certainly that right-hand panel contains chat, or it contains social networking information
[00:50:56.140 --> 00:50:58.340]   about the contact that you have.
[00:50:58.340 --> 00:51:04.660]   It only contains ads if you're looking at a piece of mail from a contact who's not in
[00:51:04.660 --> 00:51:07.340]   your address book, not in one of your social networks.
[00:51:07.340 --> 00:51:08.500]   Well, that's interesting.
[00:51:08.500 --> 00:51:09.500]   Or such.
[00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:17.300]   So if Leo, if you sent me a message to my outlook.com address, as soon as I opened that, the thing
[00:51:17.300 --> 00:51:19.740]   on the side would show me our social connections.
[00:51:19.740 --> 00:51:24.180]   And then I could also click the chat button up at the top and we could chat directly there
[00:51:24.180 --> 00:51:26.820]   without having to leave the mail environment.
[00:51:26.820 --> 00:51:31.220]   So there is some smarts in that right panel.
[00:51:31.220 --> 00:51:39.460]   But you've just identified the problem, which is there is some very, very intelligent design
[00:51:39.460 --> 00:51:41.660]   and very cool new features in there.
[00:51:41.660 --> 00:51:45.460]   But somebody like you, you're not going to notice it because you're not going to use
[00:51:45.460 --> 00:51:46.460]   it.
[00:51:46.460 --> 00:51:50.020]   And you're in the Gmail world.
[00:51:50.020 --> 00:51:52.740]   You have a tremendous investment there.
[00:51:52.740 --> 00:51:58.140]   I think the only people that Microsoft can pry away from Gmail are those who have it as
[00:51:58.140 --> 00:52:02.180]   kind of a secondary address that they use for the things where they don't want to use
[00:52:02.180 --> 00:52:03.660]   their real address.
[00:52:03.660 --> 00:52:05.940]   You know what's really said is a lot of these features.
[00:52:05.940 --> 00:52:09.980]   Years ago I saw Brad Garlinghouse used to be head of communications at Yahoo for many
[00:52:09.980 --> 00:52:10.980]   years.
[00:52:10.980 --> 00:52:13.420]   Showed me a lot of this kind of thing years ago.
[00:52:13.420 --> 00:52:15.420]   And it just never got productized at Yahoo.
[00:52:15.420 --> 00:52:20.540]   You'd see a lot of things, like a lot of stuff that's showing up today, Yahoo had many years
[00:52:20.540 --> 00:52:23.180]   ago, but it never made its way into the product.
[00:52:23.180 --> 00:52:26.140]   And that was what was, that's the problem they face there.
[00:52:26.140 --> 00:52:29.180]   And I do think though, if they create a better product, people will go to it.
[00:52:29.180 --> 00:52:30.180]   I don't agree with you.
[00:52:30.180 --> 00:52:32.140]   I've switched a million times to emails.
[00:52:32.140 --> 00:52:37.260]   And I think if it's a quantumly better, it's a question is it's got to be quantumly better.
[00:52:37.260 --> 00:52:39.700]   But I think people will switch if it's a better product.
[00:52:39.700 --> 00:52:40.860]   That's, yeah, I agree.
[00:52:40.860 --> 00:52:43.860]   If there's some, you got to put something in there that people go, "Wow, I got to have
[00:52:43.860 --> 00:52:44.860]   that."
[00:52:44.860 --> 00:52:46.420]   I tried that with Priority Inbox.
[00:52:46.420 --> 00:52:47.780]   It was an interesting, it was a good idea.
[00:52:47.780 --> 00:52:49.420]   It's not really well implemented.
[00:52:49.420 --> 00:52:52.380]   Sweep is actually a good idea, but it's hard to find.
[00:52:52.380 --> 00:52:53.380]   Nobody knows about it.
[00:52:53.380 --> 00:52:54.380]   Also, there's an opportunity.
[00:52:54.380 --> 00:52:56.180]   Google Mail has bloated, like bloated.
[00:52:56.180 --> 00:52:59.980]   It reminds me, I'm like, where, what did they just hire all these Microsoft people over
[00:52:59.980 --> 00:53:00.980]   there or something?
[00:53:00.980 --> 00:53:02.820]   I don't know anything.
[00:53:02.820 --> 00:53:04.780]   It's like, there's a huge opportunity.
[00:53:04.780 --> 00:53:10.100]   I'll tell you what, anybody who put share next to view and download in all of my picture
[00:53:10.100 --> 00:53:13.540]   attachments on Gmail should be shot.
[00:53:13.540 --> 00:53:15.540]   You accidentally share a lot of pictures.
[00:53:15.540 --> 00:53:20.340]   At least four times a week will accidentally click share because it's put in the middle
[00:53:20.340 --> 00:53:27.260]   between view and download on every image attachment in Gmail and it's infuriating.
[00:53:27.260 --> 00:53:29.980]   One thing we learned this week, and we're going to talk about it in just a bit, we actually
[00:53:29.980 --> 00:53:33.940]   learned a lot about Apple and the Apple Samsung trial, including the fact that Apple actually
[00:53:33.940 --> 00:53:40.500]   does care what consumers thinks and even surveys them despite all appearances.
[00:53:40.500 --> 00:53:42.500]   So we'll talk about that in just a little bit of great panel.
[00:53:42.500 --> 00:53:47.020]   Boy, this is just, I feel like, I feel like finally I can ask all these questions that
[00:53:47.020 --> 00:53:49.740]   those lousy panels from the last few weeks really couldn't answer.
[00:53:49.740 --> 00:53:52.860]   If you don't mind, we're going to go back in time.
[00:53:52.860 --> 00:53:55.020]   Ed Bott is here from ZDNet.
[00:53:55.020 --> 00:53:59.380]   Long time, friend, great to have him, Justin Robert Young.
[00:53:59.380 --> 00:54:04.820]   And I do want to talk about the hottest book in several generations.
[00:54:04.820 --> 00:54:05.820]   Absolutely.
[00:54:05.820 --> 00:54:06.820]   It's sexy.
[00:54:06.820 --> 00:54:07.820]   It's smart.
[00:54:07.820 --> 00:54:10.820]   It's well dressed.
[00:54:10.820 --> 00:54:13.180]   We'll talk about it in just a second with Justin.
[00:54:13.180 --> 00:54:15.340]   Also my good friend.
[00:54:15.340 --> 00:54:16.660]   It's always nice to have you.
[00:54:16.660 --> 00:54:17.900]   Patrick Norton from Techzilla.
[00:54:17.900 --> 00:54:19.060]   How's things going at Techzilla?
[00:54:19.060 --> 00:54:20.060]   Good.
[00:54:20.060 --> 00:54:21.060]   How's Discovery treating you?
[00:54:21.060 --> 00:54:22.740]   You know, they seem to be really nice people.
[00:54:22.740 --> 00:54:28.820]   I got to go talk to the basically did a presentation myself and our VP of programming and Jim
[00:54:28.820 --> 00:54:30.220]   Lauterbach, our CEO.
[00:54:30.220 --> 00:54:32.420]   And it was exciting.
[00:54:32.420 --> 00:54:34.660]   There were like 300 people in the room and a few of them.
[00:54:34.660 --> 00:54:35.660]   In Rockville?
[00:54:35.660 --> 00:54:37.060]   In Silver Spring, Maryland.
[00:54:37.060 --> 00:54:38.060]   Silver Spring, yeah.
[00:54:38.060 --> 00:54:42.780]   You know, I just say, you know, I wrote one of the, I covered Discovery's beginnings at
[00:54:42.780 --> 00:54:44.980]   The Washington Post 100 years ago.
[00:54:44.980 --> 00:54:49.940]   And I'll never forget John Hendrix, the founder of Discovery many years ago.
[00:54:49.940 --> 00:54:53.460]   It started to explode a little bit, but it was still tiny and it got lucky because it
[00:54:53.460 --> 00:54:56.300]   got on Liberty Media's stations and stuff.
[00:54:56.300 --> 00:54:58.180]   And I said, what's the secret of your success?
[00:54:58.180 --> 00:55:01.140]   It's the best quote I've ever had in the story ever in my whole life.
[00:55:01.140 --> 00:55:04.740]   But I said to Ted Ricks, who's a quirky guy, the guy who founded Discovery.
[00:55:04.740 --> 00:55:07.900]   And so what's the big secret to your success kind of like softball?
[00:55:07.900 --> 00:55:11.860]   And he said, Kara, sharks and Nazis, Nazis and sharks.
[00:55:11.860 --> 00:55:13.580]   And it still is.
[00:55:13.580 --> 00:55:16.820]   In fact, are you guys doing shark week in a Texas?
[00:55:16.820 --> 00:55:21.660]   I was just down in Monterey Bay Aquarium and Hopkins.
[00:55:21.660 --> 00:55:24.660]   No, but I, I, sharks and Nazis.
[00:55:24.660 --> 00:55:26.180]   Hey, next week.
[00:55:26.180 --> 00:55:28.980]   It's the best quote ever in my life that I've used period.
[00:55:28.980 --> 00:55:29.980]   There's never been a better one.
[00:55:29.980 --> 00:55:32.780]   Hey, when you find something that works, don't fix it.
[00:55:32.780 --> 00:55:33.780]   Just keep doing it.
[00:55:33.780 --> 00:55:34.300]   Exactly.
[00:55:34.300 --> 00:55:37.540]   20 years shark week is the longest running 25 years.
[00:55:37.540 --> 00:55:38.540]   25 years.
[00:55:38.540 --> 00:55:39.540]   Wow.
[00:55:39.540 --> 00:55:40.540]   It's unbelievable.
[00:55:40.540 --> 00:55:41.540]   I don't know.
[00:55:41.540 --> 00:55:42.540]   You combine sharks and Nazis some way.
[00:55:42.540 --> 00:55:43.540]   I don't know.
[00:55:43.540 --> 00:55:44.540]   Oh, I think you could.
[00:55:44.540 --> 00:55:49.060]   He Nazis to sharks and the less popular Hitler weekend, which was canceled after one
[00:55:49.060 --> 00:55:50.060]   year.
[00:55:50.060 --> 00:55:51.060]   That wasn't so good.
[00:55:51.060 --> 00:55:52.060]   No.
[00:55:52.060 --> 00:55:53.060]   We're brought to you today.
[00:55:53.060 --> 00:55:54.420]   And of course, Karis Swisher is here from All Things Day.
[00:55:54.420 --> 00:55:55.420]   What a great panel.
[00:55:55.420 --> 00:55:56.740]   So, so much fun.
[00:55:56.740 --> 00:55:57.740]   So much insight.
[00:55:57.740 --> 00:55:59.820]   I'm just dripping with insight.
[00:55:59.820 --> 00:56:02.660]   I should have sworn my insight.
[00:56:02.660 --> 00:56:03.660]   Deodorant.
[00:56:03.660 --> 00:56:06.900]   We're brought to you today by freshbooks.com.
[00:56:06.900 --> 00:56:11.660]   FreshBooks is the ultimate solution for small business owners who don't, who does,
[00:56:11.660 --> 00:56:13.260]   who don't like doing invoicing.
[00:56:13.260 --> 00:56:15.700]   FreshBooks does it and makes it easy.
[00:56:15.700 --> 00:56:19.180]   In fact, I was a fresh books user for a long time.
[00:56:19.180 --> 00:56:22.500]   Amber MacArthur introduced it to me in 2004.
[00:56:22.500 --> 00:56:26.580]   And now I think it's three and a half million users later.
[00:56:26.580 --> 00:56:31.460]   FreshBooks is just the way to send and pay invoices.
[00:56:31.460 --> 00:56:32.620]   Focus on your work.
[00:56:32.620 --> 00:56:36.060]   Such paperwork with freshbooks.com.
[00:56:36.060 --> 00:56:38.340]   They get, I mean, it's wonderful.
[00:56:38.340 --> 00:56:42.020]   I'll give you a little tour here if you go to the freshbooks.com website.
[00:56:42.020 --> 00:56:43.540]   The invoice creation is very simple.
[00:56:43.540 --> 00:56:46.740]   The email invoices, they will print out an invoice stamp and mail it as well for an
[00:56:46.740 --> 00:56:47.900]   additional fee.
[00:56:47.900 --> 00:56:53.300]   But what I love is they integrate payments into that email.
[00:56:53.300 --> 00:56:55.300]   And believe it or not, your clients do want to pay you.
[00:56:55.300 --> 00:56:58.580]   It's just as much of a pain in the butt for them as making the invoice was in the first
[00:56:58.580 --> 00:56:59.580]   place.
[00:56:59.580 --> 00:57:01.700]   So if you make it easy for them, they pay you faster.
[00:57:01.700 --> 00:57:07.020]   And they literally, you will speed up the time it takes to get paid.
[00:57:07.020 --> 00:57:10.020]   If they don't pay you, they've got hassle-free invoice follow-up.
[00:57:10.020 --> 00:57:12.820]   90, 30, 90, 60 days, you set that up.
[00:57:12.820 --> 00:57:16.020]   Make sure that the clients reminded you, owe me some money.
[00:57:16.020 --> 00:57:18.020]   It's very professional looking.
[00:57:18.020 --> 00:57:20.380]   If you do time and expenses, it's really easy.
[00:57:20.380 --> 00:57:24.420]   They have an app for the iPhone or there's a web app so you can just start and stop,
[00:57:24.420 --> 00:57:25.420]   start and stop.
[00:57:25.420 --> 00:57:29.620]   If you're an attorney or you do billable hours and then it automatically goes right into
[00:57:29.620 --> 00:57:30.620]   the invoice.
[00:57:30.620 --> 00:57:31.620]   I'm not going to do billable currencies.
[00:57:31.620 --> 00:57:35.820]   This was great for me because I was working in Canada and the US and so I could bill in
[00:57:35.820 --> 00:57:37.900]   the appropriate currency.
[00:57:37.900 --> 00:57:42.740]   Great for, in fact, this is the kind of the stealth feature that we don't mention.
[00:57:42.740 --> 00:57:46.060]   You could set up recurring invoices because you know, your invoice is always the same
[00:57:46.060 --> 00:57:47.060]   over and over again.
[00:57:47.060 --> 00:57:50.700]   But you can also, if your client goes for it, set up recurring payments.
[00:57:50.700 --> 00:57:54.900]   So once you get that set up, it's just kind of like friction-free commerce.
[00:57:54.900 --> 00:57:56.260]   It's so awesome.
[00:57:56.260 --> 00:57:57.500]   I want you to try it right now.
[00:57:57.500 --> 00:58:04.980]   30 days free, you get all the features of FreshBooks, everything, the multiple clients,
[00:58:04.980 --> 00:58:07.420]   multiple users, as many invoices as you want.
[00:58:07.420 --> 00:58:08.980]   For 30 days, absolutely free.
[00:58:08.980 --> 00:58:13.260]   All you have to do is go to freshbooks.com.
[00:58:13.260 --> 00:58:18.300]   If you're in business for yourself, if you're a small business, you want to get paid.
[00:58:18.300 --> 00:58:19.540]   This is the easy way to do it.
[00:58:19.540 --> 00:58:20.540]   You got to send those invoices.
[00:58:20.540 --> 00:58:24.340]   Oh, by the way, your account will love you a tax time because it's all collated and makes
[00:58:24.340 --> 00:58:25.580]   it very easy.
[00:58:25.580 --> 00:58:29.700]   Freshbooks.com, I don't think they ask, but if they do, just say you heard it on Twitter.
[00:58:29.700 --> 00:58:32.100]   I don't think they ask, but if they do, FreshBooks.
[00:58:32.100 --> 00:58:34.060]   Yup, your computer.
[00:58:34.060 --> 00:58:37.660]   While your book- It's joint, I heard it on Twitter.
[00:58:37.660 --> 00:58:40.300]   So I think this has been fascinating.
[00:58:40.300 --> 00:58:43.260]   You know, I'm not normally into these patent lawsuits.
[00:58:43.260 --> 00:58:44.260]   They just seem interminable.
[00:58:44.260 --> 00:58:45.260]   They go on and on and on.
[00:58:45.260 --> 00:58:50.860]   But occasionally we'll get a judge like in the Oracle Google lawsuit who's just a character.
[00:58:50.860 --> 00:58:53.580]   Or you'll get some very interesting revelations.
[00:58:53.580 --> 00:59:00.020]   And that's what we're getting this week in the Samsung Apple lawsuit.
[00:59:00.020 --> 00:59:04.380]   Nothing says party like a company that is unbelievably secret and vindictive towards
[00:59:04.380 --> 00:59:07.220]   reporters having to give all the information in public.
[00:59:07.220 --> 00:59:11.420]   Well, and Apple did go to the judges and say, "Look, we do not want to give out sales
[00:59:11.420 --> 00:59:12.420]   numbers."
[00:59:12.420 --> 00:59:16.500]   You know, they give out kind of overall sales numbers at their quarterly analyst reports,
[00:59:16.500 --> 00:59:17.580]   but they said, "We don't.
[00:59:17.580 --> 00:59:18.580]   We're not going to get in the judge."
[00:59:18.580 --> 00:59:21.020]   I think agreed to that.
[00:59:21.020 --> 00:59:27.420]   The judge was mad, a little bit mad at the Samsung lawyers because she told Samsung,
[00:59:27.420 --> 00:59:33.780]   "You cannot introduce into evidence your ideas that the iPhone was copied from Sony.
[00:59:33.780 --> 00:59:35.620]   We're not going to introduce it."
[00:59:35.620 --> 00:59:39.620]   So the lawyers apparently, I guess, just went to the press and said, "Well, just in
[00:59:39.620 --> 00:59:40.620]   case."
[00:59:40.620 --> 00:59:44.820]   And Judge Cohen literally pulled each juror individually.
[00:59:44.820 --> 00:59:49.300]   Did you see these stories in the press?
[00:59:49.300 --> 00:59:51.060]   This is one of them from the Verge.
[00:59:51.060 --> 00:59:52.900]   Is that about the Joni phone?
[00:59:52.900 --> 00:59:53.900]   The Joni phone?
[00:59:53.900 --> 00:59:54.900]   Yeah.
[00:59:54.900 --> 00:59:55.900]   You call it the Joni?
[00:59:55.900 --> 00:59:56.900]   Yeah.
[00:59:56.900 --> 01:00:00.100]   Joni, she loves Chachi.
[01:00:00.100 --> 01:00:01.300]   This was not stolen.
[01:00:01.300 --> 01:00:02.300]   This was not...
[01:00:02.300 --> 01:00:06.500]   You guys at All Things D actually had some of these interesting prototypes.
[01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:10.100]   Inafrit has really done a great job covering this case.
[01:00:10.100 --> 01:00:11.100]   Yeah, she has.
[01:00:11.100 --> 01:00:12.100]   Yeah.
[01:00:12.100 --> 01:00:13.100]   She's great.
[01:00:13.100 --> 01:00:14.100]   Those did incredible.
[01:00:14.100 --> 01:00:15.100]   I mean, it's interesting.
[01:00:15.100 --> 01:00:20.140]   I always am fascinated by what gets a lot of traffic and they went crazy on this one.
[01:00:20.140 --> 01:00:22.940]   Well, it's Apple and people are very interested.
[01:00:22.940 --> 01:00:23.940]   Also some of the tidbits like the fact that...
[01:00:23.940 --> 01:00:28.340]   Yes, I have to tell you, Merissa Meris is keeping up with Apple in terms of interest by reader.
[01:00:28.340 --> 01:00:29.340]   There you go.
[01:00:29.340 --> 01:00:31.020]   You're on top of the big stories.
[01:00:31.020 --> 01:00:32.220]   No, I'm just...
[01:00:32.220 --> 01:00:35.020]   It's odd what's interesting to people.
[01:00:35.020 --> 01:00:36.020]   Anyway...
[01:00:36.020 --> 01:00:38.420]   Yeah, it is odd and I guess it's predictable, but...
[01:00:38.420 --> 01:00:39.420]   Sort of.
[01:00:39.420 --> 01:00:40.420]   Sometimes.
[01:00:40.420 --> 01:00:42.860]   I think sometimes some stories are more important and they don't get enough attention.
[01:00:42.860 --> 01:00:44.180]   Well, that I agree with.
[01:00:44.180 --> 01:00:45.180]   This one did.
[01:00:45.180 --> 01:00:46.180]   This one did.
[01:00:46.180 --> 01:00:48.100]   This one it was interesting and she did a great job putting a slideshow together, which
[01:00:48.100 --> 01:00:49.700]   is people want to see.
[01:00:49.700 --> 01:00:54.140]   And the fact that some of this stuff was done in around a kitchen table I found fascinating.
[01:00:54.140 --> 01:00:55.140]   Right.
[01:00:55.140 --> 01:00:57.500]   It was a good use of a slideshow.
[01:00:57.500 --> 01:01:01.340]   There's no cats or lesbians kissing and we managed to get traffic.
[01:01:01.340 --> 01:01:04.980]   You know, I have to say, I was watching an Olympic slideshow.
[01:01:04.980 --> 01:01:05.980]   I was kind of curious.
[01:01:05.980 --> 01:01:10.420]   I just want to see some pictures because I had missed most of the beach volleyball on
[01:01:10.420 --> 01:01:11.420]   TV.
[01:01:11.420 --> 01:01:15.940]   I found somewhere a slideshow of beach volleyball.
[01:01:15.940 --> 01:01:17.220]   Very nice images.
[01:01:17.220 --> 01:01:24.940]   But every fourth or fifth image, they would put an ad up for a testosterone supplement.
[01:01:24.940 --> 01:01:28.340]   And I just thought, you know, this is annoying.
[01:01:28.340 --> 01:01:29.340]   Wow.
[01:01:29.340 --> 01:01:30.340]   And then...
[01:01:30.340 --> 01:01:31.340]   And then...
[01:01:31.340 --> 01:01:32.340]   And then...
[01:01:32.340 --> 01:01:33.340]   And then...
[01:01:33.340 --> 01:01:34.340]   And then...
[01:01:34.340 --> 01:01:35.340]   And then...
[01:01:35.340 --> 01:01:36.340]   And then...
[01:01:36.340 --> 01:01:39.100]   We're not a big slideshow doer, but this case it worked out fine.
[01:01:39.100 --> 01:01:40.100]   Well, it's...
[01:01:40.100 --> 01:01:43.540]   Because you know, you're watching and you know that they're billing the advertiser for each
[01:01:43.540 --> 01:01:47.380]   time that I had flashes up, even though I'm pressing quit as quick as I can to go to
[01:01:47.380 --> 01:01:50.460]   the next picture of Missy May trainer.
[01:01:50.460 --> 01:01:53.780]   Anyway, so yeah, I don't like slideshows.
[01:01:53.780 --> 01:01:56.460]   I think that's kind of a cheap thing that a lot of blogs do.
[01:01:56.460 --> 01:01:57.460]   Yeah.
[01:01:57.460 --> 01:01:58.460]   Yeah.
[01:01:58.460 --> 01:01:59.460]   To build page views.
[01:01:59.460 --> 01:02:00.460]   But this was quite interesting.
[01:02:00.460 --> 01:02:02.620]   So what else did we learn?
[01:02:02.620 --> 01:02:03.620]   Are you...
[01:02:03.620 --> 01:02:04.620]   Do you pay attention to this Ed bot?
[01:02:04.620 --> 01:02:05.620]   I mean...
[01:02:05.620 --> 01:02:06.620]   I do.
[01:02:06.620 --> 01:02:08.780]   I thought was really interesting.
[01:02:08.780 --> 01:02:14.780]   One of the revelations that came out from that trial was that Steve Jobs had been publicly
[01:02:14.780 --> 01:02:18.580]   saying, "Seven inch tablet is stupid, stupid, stupid."
[01:02:18.580 --> 01:02:21.340]   No, you can't do anything on it.
[01:02:21.340 --> 01:02:24.760]   And very, very publicly saying this.
[01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:31.700]   And then there was an email that was introduced into evidence from Eddy Q at Apple linking
[01:02:31.700 --> 01:02:37.500]   to an article from GigaOM by Kevin Tofel who had said, "I think I've been playing with
[01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:40.500]   the Samsung seven inch tablet and it's really awesome."
[01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:42.460]   And Eddy Q said, "I agree with this.
[01:02:42.460 --> 01:02:46.980]   It's really good for reading, for Facebook, for mail, not so good for web browsing, but
[01:02:46.980 --> 01:02:49.380]   there's a strong case to be made for this."
[01:02:49.380 --> 01:02:53.660]   And I talked to Steve, this was from February of 2011, and he said, "I talked to Steve about
[01:02:53.660 --> 01:02:54.660]   this around Thanksgiving."
[01:02:54.660 --> 01:02:56.700]   And he agreed with that.
[01:02:56.700 --> 01:02:58.700]   So here you have...
[01:02:58.700 --> 01:02:59.700]   Oh!
[01:02:59.700 --> 01:03:00.700]   You're kidding.
[01:03:00.700 --> 01:03:02.860]   I mean, he did it a D every year.
[01:03:02.860 --> 01:03:05.940]   I mean, he'd say, "I'd never gonna get into phones," and then they'd be introducing the
[01:03:05.940 --> 01:03:07.660]   iPhone the next year.
[01:03:07.660 --> 01:03:10.500]   And one year finally I said, "What are you not doing this year?"
[01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:12.260]   Because it's not really good to know.
[01:03:12.260 --> 01:03:13.260]   But he did that all the time.
[01:03:13.260 --> 01:03:14.460]   That was like classic.
[01:03:14.460 --> 01:03:16.900]   But that was kind of a big one because he called...
[01:03:16.900 --> 01:03:22.780]   He appeared on an analyst call, which he rarely did, in 2010, and kind of went off.
[01:03:22.780 --> 01:03:26.340]   The seven inches in terrible idea, it's half the screen real estate of the iPad, it's
[01:03:26.340 --> 01:03:27.340]   a terrible idea.
[01:03:27.340 --> 01:03:29.340]   I told you he was serious about it.
[01:03:29.340 --> 01:03:30.340]   Yeah, maybe...
[01:03:30.340 --> 01:03:32.180]   Their seven inches were terrible.
[01:03:32.180 --> 01:03:33.180]   Not his.
[01:03:33.180 --> 01:03:34.180]   Not his.
[01:03:34.180 --> 01:03:37.100]   And by the way, it was 7.467, or whatever.
[01:03:37.100 --> 01:03:38.100]   You know what I mean?
[01:03:38.100 --> 01:03:39.100]   I think it's a slightly different...
[01:03:39.100 --> 01:03:40.100]   It's almost eight.
[01:03:40.100 --> 01:03:41.100]   It's 7.85, I think.
[01:03:41.100 --> 01:03:42.100]   Yeah, right.
[01:03:42.100 --> 01:03:43.100]   So...
[01:03:43.100 --> 01:03:45.460]   Well, well, the rumors, no one knows.
[01:03:45.460 --> 01:03:46.460]   It's bigger.
[01:03:46.460 --> 01:03:47.660]   But this does, you're right, Ed.
[01:03:47.660 --> 01:03:52.020]   But this does kind of make one think that this is probably gonna be announced in September
[01:03:52.020 --> 01:03:53.380]   as some had speculated.
[01:03:53.380 --> 01:03:54.380]   Absolutely.
[01:03:54.380 --> 01:03:55.380]   I think...
[01:03:55.380 --> 01:03:56.540]   I don't know what any Q sounds like.
[01:03:56.540 --> 01:03:57.740]   I don't remember.
[01:03:57.740 --> 01:04:00.140]   But it seems like you should talk like this.
[01:04:00.140 --> 01:04:03.340]   Hey, I'm Eddy Q.
[01:04:03.340 --> 01:04:04.340]   I'm talking here.
[01:04:04.340 --> 01:04:05.340]   Oh!
[01:04:05.340 --> 01:04:06.340]   Oh!
[01:04:06.340 --> 01:04:07.340]   Oh!
[01:04:07.340 --> 01:04:08.340]   I believe...
[01:04:08.340 --> 01:04:09.340]   Oh!
[01:04:09.340 --> 01:04:12.140]   I believe there will be a seven inch market and we should do one, said Eddy Q.
[01:04:12.140 --> 01:04:14.580]   I tend to agree.
[01:04:14.580 --> 01:04:15.580]   So...
[01:04:15.580 --> 01:04:16.580]   Bloody out of your head?
[01:04:16.580 --> 01:04:17.580]   Oh, whoa!
[01:04:17.580 --> 01:04:18.580]   I like that.
[01:04:18.580 --> 01:04:19.580]   Whoa!
[01:04:19.580 --> 01:04:23.980]   Having used a Samsung Galaxy, I tend to agree.
[01:04:23.980 --> 01:04:28.300]   So anyway, that does make me believe that they are gonna do the seven inch.
[01:04:28.300 --> 01:04:30.580]   We're seeing, by the way, a date now.
[01:04:30.580 --> 01:04:33.900]   You guys are really good, Cara, at getting the dates for the Apple things.
[01:04:33.900 --> 01:04:34.900]   Yes, we are.
[01:04:34.900 --> 01:04:35.900]   Do you have a date?
[01:04:35.900 --> 01:04:37.940]   I think someone else did.
[01:04:37.940 --> 01:04:39.740]   I don't know if we've confirmed it.
[01:04:39.740 --> 01:04:40.740]   For the announcement?
[01:04:40.740 --> 01:04:41.740]   Or the latest.
[01:04:41.740 --> 01:04:42.740]   Or the latest.
[01:04:42.740 --> 01:04:43.740]   September 12th for the announcement.
[01:04:43.740 --> 01:04:44.740]   Yeah.
[01:04:44.740 --> 01:04:45.740]   October 25th for shipping.
[01:04:45.740 --> 01:04:46.740]   Question number.
[01:04:46.740 --> 01:04:47.740]   Yeah.
[01:04:47.740 --> 01:04:48.740]   But again, these are rumors.
[01:04:48.740 --> 01:04:49.740]   Was it I'm more?
[01:04:49.740 --> 01:04:50.740]   Somebody got this story.
[01:04:50.740 --> 01:04:51.740]   Yeah.
[01:04:51.740 --> 01:04:52.740]   I think it was Renee Ritchie.
[01:04:52.740 --> 01:04:55.900]   I was written recently, but I was away, so I wasn't paying.
[01:04:55.900 --> 01:04:57.500]   Say, I don't do actual reporting.
[01:04:57.500 --> 01:05:01.300]   What I do, you know, I need two sources, so I call you guys and somebody else.
[01:05:01.300 --> 01:05:02.300]   I don't know.
[01:05:02.300 --> 01:05:03.300]   I'll find out.
[01:05:03.300 --> 01:05:04.300]   I'll find...
[01:05:04.300 --> 01:05:07.300]   We'll have the right to, but if that is the one I think John also said was...
[01:05:07.300 --> 01:05:09.420]   Renee Ritchie and I'm more...
[01:05:09.420 --> 01:05:10.420]   And Renee's been...
[01:05:10.420 --> 01:05:11.420]   We've had Renee on the show many times.
[01:05:11.420 --> 01:05:12.420]   Yeah.
[01:05:12.420 --> 01:05:13.420]   Good guy.
[01:05:13.420 --> 01:05:14.980]   It's definitely that week, for sure.
[01:05:14.980 --> 01:05:15.980]   September 12th.
[01:05:15.980 --> 01:05:18.260]   And he said this is from a source who's been right before.
[01:05:18.260 --> 01:05:20.100]   This is what everybody always says.
[01:05:20.100 --> 01:05:21.100]   Right.
[01:05:21.100 --> 01:05:22.100]   This is the week.
[01:05:22.100 --> 01:05:25.380]   They're all things D annual barbecue that week, so I'm hoping...
[01:05:25.380 --> 01:05:26.860]   Well, it has to be then.
[01:05:26.860 --> 01:05:28.340]   Having everybody come in.
[01:05:28.340 --> 01:05:29.340]   It has to.
[01:05:29.340 --> 01:05:32.540]   September 12th, iPhone 5, September 21st.
[01:05:32.540 --> 01:05:39.180]   And if they do what is kind of being called the iPad mini, perhaps it'll be announced
[01:05:39.180 --> 01:05:41.140]   at the same time.
[01:05:41.140 --> 01:05:44.380]   Their source is not saying that, although it might be confusing if you look at the article
[01:05:44.380 --> 01:05:47.980]   kind of implies that it is, but their source is not saying that.
[01:05:47.980 --> 01:05:48.980]   I don't know if they're going to call it.
[01:05:48.980 --> 01:05:49.980]   I mean, it was interesting.
[01:05:49.980 --> 01:05:50.980]   Oh, that's a terrible name.
[01:05:50.980 --> 01:05:56.420]   So, Tim Cook talked about naming a D this year when we interviewed him at a D10.
[01:05:56.420 --> 01:05:57.420]   Yes, I loved that.
[01:05:57.420 --> 01:05:58.420]   Yeah.
[01:05:58.420 --> 01:05:59.420]   And they may not give it a name.
[01:05:59.420 --> 01:06:00.420]   Right.
[01:06:00.420 --> 01:06:02.060]   They may just, like, they don't, they may not give it a fancy name.
[01:06:02.060 --> 01:06:06.220]   You can't call it the iPad mini because then people call it the big iPad, the iPad maxi.
[01:06:06.220 --> 01:06:07.220]   And it's not a good name.
[01:06:07.220 --> 01:06:08.220]   Yes, yeah.
[01:06:08.220 --> 01:06:09.220]   Then it gets into...
[01:06:09.220 --> 01:06:10.220]   Yeah.
[01:06:10.220 --> 01:06:11.220]   Yeah.
[01:06:11.220 --> 01:06:12.220]   Don't go.
[01:06:12.220 --> 01:06:13.220]   Don't go there.
[01:06:13.220 --> 01:06:14.220]   Get into lady jokes.
[01:06:14.220 --> 01:06:15.220]   Lady jokes.
[01:06:15.220 --> 01:06:16.220]   I don't know.
[01:06:16.220 --> 01:06:17.220]   I'm not sure what they're going to call it, but it may not be any, it may not have a special
[01:06:17.220 --> 01:06:18.220]   name.
[01:06:18.220 --> 01:06:21.260]   I'm just playing why they're doing that because I thought that was very strange that the new
[01:06:21.260 --> 01:06:23.740]   iPad has no name.
[01:06:23.740 --> 01:06:27.060]   I just, I think they decided not to play that game, I guess.
[01:06:27.060 --> 01:06:28.060]   I don't know.
[01:06:28.060 --> 01:06:29.060]   So, there'll be the new iPhone?
[01:06:29.060 --> 01:06:31.380]   It's the new iPhone, the latest iPhone.
[01:06:31.380 --> 01:06:36.300]   How do you distinguish a seven inch new iPad from a 10 inch new iPad?
[01:06:36.300 --> 01:06:37.300]   The next iPad.
[01:06:37.300 --> 01:06:38.300]   I don't know why I have to be...
[01:06:38.300 --> 01:06:39.300]   I don't know.
[01:06:39.300 --> 01:06:40.300]   I'm not a bracketed.
[01:06:40.300 --> 01:06:44.940]   Well, I mean, they don't, they don't, they don't, it's not like the MacBook Air 12, you
[01:06:44.940 --> 01:06:45.940]   know?
[01:06:45.940 --> 01:06:50.020]   They say, as somebody who speaks about these products all the time to normal people on the
[01:06:50.020 --> 01:06:52.760]   radio, I need a name.
[01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:54.220]   Well, you can make one up for yourself.
[01:06:54.220 --> 01:06:55.220]   I do.
[01:06:55.220 --> 01:06:57.220]   I call it the iPad 3 because they don't otherwise...
[01:06:57.220 --> 01:06:59.220]   They're not going to do that.
[01:06:59.220 --> 01:07:01.060]   They're not going to do that.
[01:07:01.060 --> 01:07:02.540]   They said it as much as they.
[01:07:02.540 --> 01:07:03.540]   I know, I know.
[01:07:03.540 --> 01:07:04.540]   I read, I read...
[01:07:04.540 --> 01:07:06.020]   Why make it simpler for consumers?
[01:07:06.020 --> 01:07:08.000]   I mean, I don't know.
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:09.000]   It's peculiar.
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:10.000]   How much do you think...
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:11.000]   It means how much do you need?
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:12.000]   It means how much do you need?
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:13.000]   You mean, how much do you need?
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.900]   I mean, or at least a derivation of both the iPod or the iPad, right?
[01:07:15.900 --> 01:07:18.460]   This seven inch creation that we all hope...
[01:07:18.460 --> 01:07:21.220]   To play with what Kara just said, like, obviously...
[01:07:21.220 --> 01:07:22.220]   Maybe you could...
[01:07:22.220 --> 01:07:23.220]   Go ahead.
[01:07:23.220 --> 01:07:24.220]   Go ahead.
[01:07:24.220 --> 01:07:26.140]   Obviously, or obviously, like, I'm not a marketing genius because they had the biggest, like,
[01:07:26.140 --> 01:07:30.140]   what, 20 million iPad sales last quarter without having a distinctive name.
[01:07:30.140 --> 01:07:32.140]   So people walk in, they want a new iPad.
[01:07:32.140 --> 01:07:33.140]   Only make the true signs of life.
[01:07:33.140 --> 01:07:35.700]   It could be like, it could be like Starbucks.
[01:07:35.700 --> 01:07:36.700]   I'll take the grande.
[01:07:36.700 --> 01:07:37.700]   I'll take the...
[01:07:37.700 --> 01:07:41.420]   You make up Italian words for it.
[01:07:41.420 --> 01:07:42.420]   I have...
[01:07:42.420 --> 01:07:44.740]   When I go to Starbucks, I refuse to use their...
[01:07:44.740 --> 01:07:45.740]   Venti.
[01:07:45.740 --> 01:07:46.740]   I refuse to use their...
[01:07:46.740 --> 01:07:48.420]   I just say, give me the little one.
[01:07:48.420 --> 01:07:49.420]   You're such a rebel.
[01:07:49.420 --> 01:07:50.420]   Give me the little one.
[01:07:50.420 --> 01:07:51.420]   Oh, yeah, no.
[01:07:51.420 --> 01:07:52.420]   I'm right with you, Kara.
[01:07:52.420 --> 01:07:54.860]   I will say, I want a large coffee.
[01:07:54.860 --> 01:07:55.860]   And they'll look at me like you're not using the word.
[01:07:55.860 --> 01:07:58.100]   Right, but the small does not have a small word.
[01:07:58.100 --> 01:07:59.100]   It's tall.
[01:07:59.100 --> 01:08:00.100]   The small is tall.
[01:08:00.100 --> 01:08:01.100]   Tall.
[01:08:01.100 --> 01:08:02.100]   I don't like that.
[01:08:02.100 --> 01:08:03.100]   It disturbs me.
[01:08:03.100 --> 01:08:04.100]   So I'm just saying, I'll have an iPad tall.
[01:08:04.100 --> 01:08:08.380]   You know what's really bad is when you go into a normal coffee shop and they'll say,
[01:08:08.380 --> 01:08:10.740]   I have a Venti latte, then they really give you this thing.
[01:08:10.740 --> 01:08:12.540]   They punch you right in the nose.
[01:08:12.540 --> 01:08:13.540]   Yeah.
[01:08:13.540 --> 01:08:15.300]   We're not Starbucks, sir.
[01:08:15.300 --> 01:08:16.300]   You might want to put down the...
[01:08:16.300 --> 01:08:17.300]   Give me the big iPad.
[01:08:17.300 --> 01:08:18.300]   Give me the little iPad.
[01:08:18.300 --> 01:08:19.300]   The big pad.
[01:08:19.300 --> 01:08:20.300]   I'll take the big pad.
[01:08:20.300 --> 01:08:22.340]   I'll take the little pad.
[01:08:22.340 --> 01:08:24.980]   I'm sure consumers won't have a problem with it.
[01:08:24.980 --> 01:08:25.980]   We just does.
[01:08:25.980 --> 01:08:26.980]   No, no, no.
[01:08:26.980 --> 01:08:27.980]   They'll know.
[01:08:27.980 --> 01:08:28.980]   It's just hard.
[01:08:28.980 --> 01:08:29.980]   It's not hard for consumers.
[01:08:29.980 --> 01:08:31.740]   It's hard for people who talk about this stuff.
[01:08:31.740 --> 01:08:32.740]   Right.
[01:08:32.740 --> 01:08:37.580]   Don't you've always have to parenthetically add go comma by which I mean the one released
[01:08:37.580 --> 01:08:38.580]   this...
[01:08:38.580 --> 01:08:44.540]   Well, for those of us who cover Microsoft for a living, we hit that problem this week with
[01:08:44.540 --> 01:08:45.540]   the whole Metro.
[01:08:45.540 --> 01:08:46.540]   Oh, yeah.
[01:08:46.540 --> 01:08:47.540]   Yeah.
[01:08:47.540 --> 01:08:49.660]   So tell us what happened, Ed.
[01:08:49.660 --> 01:08:51.660]   That was bizarre.
[01:08:51.660 --> 01:08:58.420]   Yeah, bizarre and...
[01:08:58.420 --> 01:09:00.820]   I want to choose my words carefully on this one.
[01:09:00.820 --> 01:09:01.820]   Don't.
[01:09:01.820 --> 01:09:02.820]   I drop bombs at it.
[01:09:02.820 --> 01:09:11.380]   My understanding is that Metro AG, a German company that I guess runs grocery stores and
[01:09:11.380 --> 01:09:13.700]   also stores that sell technology.
[01:09:13.700 --> 01:09:18.820]   So they're kind of like maybe a Costco or a Walmart thing where they have both food
[01:09:18.820 --> 01:09:21.620]   and stuff.
[01:09:21.620 --> 01:09:24.660]   And they lodged a copyright complaint against Microsoft.
[01:09:24.660 --> 01:09:32.020]   Now the interesting thing is that Metro apps does not appear anywhere in Windows 8.
[01:09:32.020 --> 01:09:34.340]   Microsoft says it's a code name.
[01:09:34.340 --> 01:09:36.420]   Yeah, right.
[01:09:36.420 --> 01:09:43.540]   In 2009, in 2010, '11 and '12, it was a product name.
[01:09:43.540 --> 01:09:46.100]   And in fact, it's in developer agreements today.
[01:09:46.100 --> 01:09:51.900]   If you sign a developer agreement to build an app for Windows 8 today, the agreement says,
[01:09:51.900 --> 01:09:56.740]   and your Metro style apps will have the following features and they will be priced such and
[01:09:56.740 --> 01:09:57.740]   such.
[01:09:57.740 --> 01:10:05.860]   And so Metro style app has been the official name of the part of Windows 8 that describes
[01:10:05.860 --> 01:10:10.820]   these new featured apps that use the WinRT API.
[01:10:10.820 --> 01:10:20.020]   And so now all of a sudden boom with no notice, Microsoft began telling developers and partners
[01:10:20.020 --> 01:10:23.660]   and its own employees do not use the word Metro at all.
[01:10:23.660 --> 01:10:24.660]   Period.
[01:10:24.660 --> 01:10:25.980]   Stop using it.
[01:10:25.980 --> 01:10:32.420]   And so last week when Mary Jo Foley and I think Tom Warren, a couple other people found out
[01:10:32.420 --> 01:10:37.900]   about this, wrote stories about it, Microsoft responded to it with this boilerplate that
[01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:41.580]   says this is a code name and we often use code names when we're in development.
[01:10:41.580 --> 01:10:46.260]   And as we go forward, we're going to use the commercial names, which is just complete
[01:10:46.260 --> 01:10:47.260]   crap.
[01:10:47.260 --> 01:10:48.260]   No, they have ads.
[01:10:48.260 --> 01:10:49.260]   It says, look, here it is.
[01:10:49.260 --> 01:10:51.860]   Develop a great style app.
[01:10:51.860 --> 01:10:56.020]   So we call it the technology formerly known as Metro.
[01:10:56.020 --> 01:10:58.060]   Do we give it a little glyph?
[01:10:58.060 --> 01:11:01.380]   I did that graphic myself and did the little copy edit mark on it.
[01:11:01.380 --> 01:11:03.220]   I like it.
[01:11:03.220 --> 01:11:05.380]   I like it, Ed.
[01:11:05.380 --> 01:11:07.780]   You call it a mess and it is a mess.
[01:11:07.780 --> 01:11:12.700]   I'm going to come out with a replacement name for it.
[01:11:12.700 --> 01:11:21.180]   But they've spent since at least the build conference when Microsoft unveiled Windows
[01:11:21.180 --> 01:11:23.820]   8 September of 2011.
[01:11:23.820 --> 01:11:29.020]   They have been heavily invested in the messaging around Metro style apps and for them to throw
[01:11:29.020 --> 01:11:36.660]   away that investment in messaging is just the, I don't know.
[01:11:36.660 --> 01:11:37.980]   That's why you think they find it.
[01:11:37.980 --> 01:11:43.060]   I was going to say this just seems like a profound failure in trademark search.
[01:11:43.060 --> 01:11:47.260]   I looked up the Metro trademark on the US patent trademark website.
[01:11:47.260 --> 01:11:49.540]   There are literally thousands.
[01:11:49.540 --> 01:11:52.260]   And the way trademarks work, it's my understanding.
[01:11:52.260 --> 01:11:53.260]   I'm not a lawyer.
[01:11:53.260 --> 01:11:54.260]   I'm just a police officer.
[01:11:54.260 --> 01:12:01.140]   The way I understand these things, you have a trademark in a specific, you can have conflicting
[01:12:01.140 --> 01:12:02.660]   trademarks if you're in different categories.
[01:12:02.660 --> 01:12:06.260]   For instance, when I went to Twitter and I said, "Hey, dude, I'm working here.
[01:12:06.260 --> 01:12:07.700]   This is called Twit."
[01:12:07.700 --> 01:12:14.900]   And they said, "Well, no, but you have a trademark in online entertainment and video.
[01:12:14.900 --> 01:12:16.580]   And we have a trademark in microblogging."
[01:12:16.580 --> 01:12:18.500]   And that's two separate trademarks.
[01:12:18.500 --> 01:12:19.820]   My lawyer agreed.
[01:12:19.820 --> 01:12:24.060]   And so Evan, I said, "Well, if you don't do television, I won't do a microblogging course.
[01:12:24.060 --> 01:12:26.140]   I've done microblogging, and now they're going to do TV."
[01:12:26.140 --> 01:12:28.100]   So they're partnering with NBC Universal.
[01:12:28.100 --> 01:12:29.100]   Yeah.
[01:12:29.100 --> 01:12:31.220]   I'd say we bring back Hail Storm.
[01:12:31.220 --> 01:12:32.220]   That's what I want.
[01:12:32.220 --> 01:12:33.220]   Hail Storm.
[01:12:33.220 --> 01:12:34.220]   Remember that?
[01:12:34.220 --> 01:12:35.220]   What's that?
[01:12:35.220 --> 01:12:39.060]   It was a brand that Microsoft had around cloud right at.
[01:12:39.060 --> 01:12:40.060]   It was so high.
[01:12:40.060 --> 01:12:43.820]   It was the original Hail Storm came.net.
[01:12:43.820 --> 01:12:44.820]   Yeah.
[01:12:44.820 --> 01:12:49.580]   And they were going to use Hail Storm to describe every web service that existed.
[01:12:49.580 --> 01:12:50.580]   Right.
[01:12:50.580 --> 01:12:53.740]   Several of us westerners inside of Microsoft pointed out this does not have positive
[01:12:53.740 --> 01:12:55.740]   connotations in business in most of the world.
[01:12:55.740 --> 01:12:56.940]   That was the best brand name ever.
[01:12:56.940 --> 01:12:57.940]   Hail Storm.
[01:12:57.940 --> 01:12:58.940]   Exactly.
[01:12:58.940 --> 01:12:59.940]   Cold, violent, aggravating.
[01:12:59.940 --> 01:13:00.940]   All right.
[01:13:00.940 --> 01:13:01.940]   We're tugging.
[01:13:01.940 --> 01:13:02.940]   Destroying from...
[01:13:02.940 --> 01:13:03.940]   Windows.
[01:13:03.940 --> 01:13:04.940]   Cars.
[01:13:04.940 --> 01:13:05.940]   The size of golf balls.
[01:13:05.940 --> 01:13:06.940]   I'm talking big.
[01:13:06.940 --> 01:13:07.940]   The people were...
[01:13:07.940 --> 01:13:08.940]   Anyways, back.
[01:13:08.940 --> 01:13:09.940]   That's how old and I are.
[01:13:09.940 --> 01:13:10.940]   I have to tell you.
[01:13:10.940 --> 01:13:18.380]   Well, you know, we have a great feature on Windows Weekly where Mary Jofoli goes back
[01:13:18.380 --> 01:13:20.380]   through the past Microsoft code names of...
[01:13:20.380 --> 01:13:21.380]   Oh, she'd know.
[01:13:21.380 --> 01:13:22.380]   It's so much fun.
[01:13:22.380 --> 01:13:24.380]   You know, the one for...
[01:13:24.380 --> 01:13:27.100]   I'm trying to remember the one from MSN, the original one.
[01:13:27.100 --> 01:13:28.100]   I can't remember.
[01:13:28.100 --> 01:13:29.100]   Marvel.
[01:13:29.100 --> 01:13:30.100]   Marvel.
[01:13:30.100 --> 01:13:31.100]   Marvel.
[01:13:31.100 --> 01:13:32.100]   Marvel.
[01:13:32.100 --> 01:13:33.100]   Just the service in Blackbird with the client.
[01:13:33.100 --> 01:13:34.100]   Wow.
[01:13:34.100 --> 01:13:35.100]   Yeah.
[01:13:35.100 --> 01:13:37.020]   Marvel was one of the MSN names for sure.
[01:13:37.020 --> 01:13:42.580]   So Microsoft has a long, happy history of making up code names that it doesn't use long...
[01:13:42.580 --> 01:13:44.020]   You know, there were a lot of them.
[01:13:44.020 --> 01:13:46.500]   But it does seem as if they had thought they could use Metro.
[01:13:46.500 --> 01:13:47.500]   Why they didn't fight this?
[01:13:47.500 --> 01:13:48.500]   This isn't...
[01:13:48.500 --> 01:13:50.940]   What did you say it's a cafe?
[01:13:50.940 --> 01:13:52.340]   The only thing that I know it's a cafe.
[01:13:52.340 --> 01:13:56.740]   No, it's a very large retail outlet.
[01:13:56.740 --> 01:13:57.740]   And the only thing you can think of...
[01:13:57.740 --> 01:13:58.740]   That's not a conflict.
[01:13:58.740 --> 01:14:00.740]   It's an online one, I think.
[01:14:00.740 --> 01:14:01.740]   Is that right?
[01:14:01.740 --> 01:14:06.140]   The only thing that I can think of is, you know, Microsoft has been involved in patent
[01:14:06.140 --> 01:14:13.540]   litigation around the Xbox and in Germany.
[01:14:13.540 --> 01:14:18.340]   And they've also been involved in a lot of antitrust stuff in the EU.
[01:14:18.340 --> 01:14:24.660]   And I can just imagine Steve Palmer throwing a chair and saying, "I do not want to pay
[01:14:24.660 --> 01:14:28.140]   another goddamn dollar to another goddamn German lawyer."
[01:14:28.140 --> 01:14:31.540]   It's Danish, not German.
[01:14:31.540 --> 01:14:36.540]   Metro.dk, or maybe this is a different one.
[01:14:36.540 --> 01:14:37.540]   Metro AG.
[01:14:37.540 --> 01:14:38.540]   Yeah, you just...
[01:14:38.540 --> 01:14:39.540]   Oh, AG.
[01:14:39.540 --> 01:14:41.540]   They're all over the EU.
[01:14:41.540 --> 01:14:42.540]   Okay.
[01:14:42.540 --> 01:14:46.060]   And that actually is relevant because you don't want to be...
[01:14:46.060 --> 01:14:49.060]   Germany is notoriously kind of anti-corporation.
[01:14:49.060 --> 01:14:50.060]   Exactly.
[01:14:50.060 --> 01:14:53.820]   So you could lose in court in Germany just because you're Microsoft.
[01:14:53.820 --> 01:15:00.140]   And Microsoft has lost a number of very high-profile, very high-priced legal cases in the EU.
[01:15:00.140 --> 01:15:03.100]   And so they might have said, "You know, but I don't know.
[01:15:03.100 --> 01:15:04.180]   They're not talking about it."
[01:15:04.180 --> 01:15:08.180]   And the public statement that they made was so transparently untrue.
[01:15:08.180 --> 01:15:09.180]   Right.
[01:15:09.180 --> 01:15:15.780]   I think they could actually have won some sympathy if they had told at least a retracted
[01:15:15.780 --> 01:15:23.140]   version of the truth here and said, "You know, somebody has confronted us with a trademark
[01:15:23.140 --> 01:15:31.740]   allegation here and we don't think it's warranted, but given our history in the EU, we don't
[01:15:31.740 --> 01:15:36.980]   feel that it's worth it to potentially risk delaying this product and throwing it...
[01:15:36.980 --> 01:15:37.980]   There you go.
[01:15:37.980 --> 01:15:39.180]   To a situation...
[01:15:39.180 --> 01:15:44.620]   That's the statement that they should have made and why they came out with this nonsense
[01:15:44.620 --> 01:15:47.140]   statement that they did beyond me.
[01:15:47.140 --> 01:15:48.820]   And nobody will talk to it.
[01:15:48.820 --> 01:15:53.540]   Microsoft and their people have basically gone dark on this stuff.
[01:15:53.540 --> 01:15:57.300]   No, this is just how Microsoft's been running itself lately.
[01:15:57.300 --> 01:15:59.220]   It's a very strange company.
[01:15:59.220 --> 01:16:01.540]   I think Microsoft's a code name.
[01:16:01.540 --> 01:16:05.260]   Eventually, they'll release the commercial name for the company.
[01:16:05.260 --> 01:16:09.780]   It's the fifth largest retailer in the world according to revenues.
[01:16:09.780 --> 01:16:12.660]   So it isn't an insignificant trademark.
[01:16:12.660 --> 01:16:19.740]   And they have been involved in some high-profile litigation as well over their trademarks.
[01:16:19.740 --> 01:16:23.580]   And so, but if they won't talk to anyone about it...
[01:16:23.580 --> 01:16:26.060]   Now this could also be a bluff.
[01:16:26.060 --> 01:16:34.300]   This could also be a negotiating tactic where it may be Metro wanted some money for a settlement
[01:16:34.300 --> 01:16:36.940]   of this thing, but the money that they asked for was too much.
[01:16:36.940 --> 01:16:38.180]   I don't know.
[01:16:38.180 --> 01:16:39.180]   We could speculate.
[01:16:39.180 --> 01:16:42.060]   It would be irresponsible not to speculate.
[01:16:42.060 --> 01:16:47.460]   That's our job and we're doing it well, I must say.
[01:16:47.460 --> 01:16:48.460]   What else do we...
[01:16:48.460 --> 01:16:52.620]   To get back to the original topic, what else do we learn about Apple this week?
[01:16:52.620 --> 01:16:57.860]   We learn that they do consumer testing and surveys, which surprised me.
[01:16:57.860 --> 01:17:00.780]   I thought they just did everything in a vacuum.
[01:17:00.780 --> 01:17:01.780]   No.
[01:17:01.780 --> 01:17:02.780]   Apparently no.
[01:17:02.780 --> 01:17:03.780]   It's like...
[01:17:03.780 --> 01:17:04.780]   What do you think?
[01:17:04.780 --> 01:17:05.780]   It's like Willy Wonka?
[01:17:05.780 --> 01:17:06.780]   Yeah.
[01:17:06.780 --> 01:17:07.780]   I think that's what Steve Jobs wanted us to think.
[01:17:07.780 --> 01:17:09.780]   They've gone fission quests.
[01:17:09.780 --> 01:17:10.780]   Yeah.
[01:17:10.780 --> 01:17:12.180]   They're a real live company.
[01:17:12.180 --> 01:17:13.180]   They have...
[01:17:13.180 --> 01:17:16.180]   I don't know if they have free food in their cafeteria or not, but I don't think they do.
[01:17:16.180 --> 01:17:17.180]   I think you pay.
[01:17:17.180 --> 01:17:18.180]   I paid.
[01:17:18.180 --> 01:17:19.180]   They always make me pay.
[01:17:19.180 --> 01:17:20.180]   I paid.
[01:17:20.180 --> 01:17:21.180]   I paid.
[01:17:21.180 --> 01:17:22.180]   Anyway, I just...
[01:17:22.180 --> 01:17:23.500]   Of course they do these things.
[01:17:23.500 --> 01:17:25.620]   They have to understand, you know, on some level.
[01:17:25.620 --> 01:17:29.100]   I think they do a lot out of instinct and what they think is good around their design
[01:17:29.100 --> 01:17:33.980]   concepts, but they certainly have to do regular testing and it makes sense.
[01:17:33.980 --> 01:17:34.980]   Why wouldn't they?
[01:17:34.980 --> 01:17:40.420]   Apple announced that 3 million downloads of OS 10 Mountain Lion, which came out last
[01:17:40.420 --> 01:17:46.500]   week in four days, they say it's the most successful OS 10 release in their history.
[01:17:46.500 --> 01:17:47.500]   It's cheap.
[01:17:47.500 --> 01:17:48.500]   It's 20 bucks.
[01:17:48.500 --> 01:17:51.100]   Apple has never put copy protection on their operating systems.
[01:17:51.100 --> 01:17:54.900]   They've never really paid any attention to where you start installing it.
[01:17:54.900 --> 01:17:55.900]   They make hardware.
[01:17:55.900 --> 01:17:56.900]   They don't need to.
[01:17:56.900 --> 01:17:57.980]   They make the hardware.
[01:17:57.980 --> 01:17:58.980]   If they're...
[01:17:58.980 --> 01:18:04.780]   You know, they aside from the Hackintosh market, which is 1/1000th of 1%, they already
[01:18:04.780 --> 01:18:08.620]   know that you paid them on average $1,500 for the hardware.
[01:18:08.620 --> 01:18:11.980]   So they're basically, you know, the 20 bucks is...
[01:18:11.980 --> 01:18:12.980]   They...
[01:18:12.980 --> 01:18:13.980]   It's...
[01:18:13.980 --> 01:18:14.980]   It's...
[01:18:14.980 --> 01:18:15.980]   It's...
[01:18:15.980 --> 01:18:16.980]   In fact, why charge at all?
[01:18:16.980 --> 01:18:17.980]   I guess because you can.
[01:18:17.980 --> 01:18:21.900]   And especially versus the other side of it, which is they want as many people with the
[01:18:21.900 --> 01:18:25.760]   newest operating system so developers can develop super cool things that make people
[01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:27.700]   want to buy Mac.
[01:18:27.700 --> 01:18:34.420]   You know, one thing that we also learned in the trial last week, Apple has spent one
[01:18:34.420 --> 01:18:38.620]   billion dollars on marketing the iPhone and the iPad.
[01:18:38.620 --> 01:18:39.620]   Well, I did.
[01:18:39.620 --> 01:18:40.620]   I saw those numbers.
[01:18:40.620 --> 01:18:41.620]   Those were very interesting.
[01:18:41.620 --> 01:18:42.620]   Yeah.
[01:18:42.620 --> 01:18:45.620]   That's more on the iPhone than the iPad, but iPhones had longer time.
[01:18:45.620 --> 01:18:46.620]   Right.
[01:18:46.620 --> 01:18:49.220]   That's been five years versus two years.
[01:18:49.220 --> 01:18:50.420]   Three or two, yeah.
[01:18:50.420 --> 01:18:51.420]   Yeah.
[01:18:51.420 --> 01:18:53.220]   Only two, believe it or not.
[01:18:53.220 --> 01:18:55.220]   It seemed to be doing something right.
[01:18:55.220 --> 01:18:56.220]   400...
[01:18:56.220 --> 01:18:57.220]   What was it?
[01:18:57.220 --> 01:18:58.220]   473 million on the iPad?
[01:18:58.220 --> 01:18:59.220]   I think that's what the number was.
[01:18:59.220 --> 01:19:00.220]   It was huge.
[01:19:00.220 --> 01:19:01.220]   Yeah.
[01:19:01.220 --> 01:19:02.220]   And huge amount of money.
[01:19:02.220 --> 01:19:03.220]   500.
[01:19:03.220 --> 01:19:04.220]   Yeah.
[01:19:04.220 --> 01:19:08.540]   I think a few Apple ads on the Olympics last this week.
[01:19:08.540 --> 01:19:09.540]   Not very good ads.
[01:19:09.540 --> 01:19:14.340]   But what do you think of the nervous genius?
[01:19:14.340 --> 01:19:16.580]   I still gave up after...
[01:19:16.580 --> 01:19:17.580]   It was like a sitcom.
[01:19:17.580 --> 01:19:19.300]   It was like a bad acting.
[01:19:19.300 --> 01:19:20.740]   No, I just gave up on...
[01:19:20.740 --> 01:19:23.220]   We don't have cable.
[01:19:23.220 --> 01:19:28.900]   And after restarting the stream 17 times during the road race last weekend, I kind of
[01:19:28.900 --> 01:19:31.100]   gave up on the Olympics for a while.
[01:19:31.100 --> 01:19:32.100]   You don't have...
[01:19:32.100 --> 01:19:34.820]   Maybe Jerry Seinfeld and Bill Gates walk down.
[01:19:34.820 --> 01:19:36.420]   Where's the churros?
[01:19:36.420 --> 01:19:37.420]   Where's the churro?
[01:19:37.420 --> 01:19:39.140]   I ask you.
[01:19:39.140 --> 01:19:40.140]   That was...
[01:19:40.140 --> 01:19:41.140]   Corinthian leather.
[01:19:41.140 --> 01:19:42.380]   I've forgotten about that commercial.
[01:19:42.380 --> 01:19:43.380]   That was...
[01:19:43.380 --> 01:19:44.380]   How do you even describe that?
[01:19:44.380 --> 01:19:45.380]   It was a...
[01:19:45.380 --> 01:19:46.380]   Well, yeah.
[01:19:46.380 --> 01:19:47.380]   But there was really...
[01:19:47.380 --> 01:19:48.380]   There were two.
[01:19:48.380 --> 01:19:49.380]   Two.
[01:19:49.380 --> 01:19:50.700]   And then they decided this is not a good idea.
[01:19:50.700 --> 01:19:54.260]   The last one ended with Bill and Jerry going off in the sunset.
[01:19:54.260 --> 01:19:56.340]   Jerry says, "Let's go get a churro."
[01:19:56.340 --> 01:19:58.740]   And then there was something about Bill shaking his butt.
[01:19:58.740 --> 01:20:01.180]   Yeah, a little butt wiggle.
[01:20:01.180 --> 01:20:04.460]   He said, like Jerry said, "Well, give me a sign."
[01:20:04.460 --> 01:20:05.940]   And Bill went like that.
[01:20:05.940 --> 01:20:06.940]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:20:06.940 --> 01:20:07.940]   Something like that.
[01:20:07.940 --> 01:20:08.940]   That was just...
[01:20:08.940 --> 01:20:09.940]   It was like a David Lynch movie.
[01:20:09.940 --> 01:20:10.940]   It was just weird.
[01:20:10.940 --> 01:20:12.500]   Like, I didn't know what was happening.
[01:20:12.500 --> 01:20:13.500]   I had no clue.
[01:20:13.500 --> 01:20:16.420]   You know, Bill Gates had brought out a little oxygen mask.
[01:20:16.420 --> 01:20:19.540]   I don't like the Apple ads.
[01:20:19.540 --> 01:20:20.540]   I'm the only person who knew them.
[01:20:20.540 --> 01:20:21.540]   The new ones?
[01:20:21.540 --> 01:20:22.540]   The genius ones?
[01:20:22.540 --> 01:20:23.540]   He's adorable.
[01:20:23.540 --> 01:20:24.540]   He's cute.
[01:20:24.540 --> 01:20:25.540]   I thought he was cute.
[01:20:25.540 --> 01:20:26.540]   Oh, you like the genius?
[01:20:26.540 --> 01:20:27.540]   You know, that's fair.
[01:20:27.540 --> 01:20:28.540]   It's cute.
[01:20:28.540 --> 01:20:29.540]   It's cute.
[01:20:29.540 --> 01:20:30.540]   They were like, "Cume..."
[01:20:30.540 --> 01:20:31.540]   "Cool."
[01:20:31.540 --> 01:20:32.540]   They weren't cool.
[01:20:32.540 --> 01:20:33.540]   And I like that.
[01:20:33.540 --> 01:20:34.540]   They were...
[01:20:34.540 --> 01:20:35.540]   They were adorable.
[01:20:35.540 --> 01:20:36.540]   They were adorable.
[01:20:36.540 --> 01:20:37.540]   I call them adorable.
[01:20:37.540 --> 01:20:38.540]   Yeah.
[01:20:38.540 --> 01:20:40.300]   Well, I guess I mean, it is an interesting...
[01:20:40.300 --> 01:20:41.780]   You know, it is no matter what it is.
[01:20:41.780 --> 01:20:43.220]   It is a change of tact, right?
[01:20:43.220 --> 01:20:46.020]   That it's not the cool, austere, minimalist.
[01:20:46.020 --> 01:20:48.380]   Here are features that you can use in daily life.
[01:20:48.380 --> 01:20:51.180]   A question is who are they aimed at?
[01:20:51.180 --> 01:20:52.180]   Walmart chubbers.
[01:20:52.180 --> 01:20:54.060]   People love that jeaned.
[01:20:54.060 --> 01:20:55.060]   My mom.
[01:20:55.060 --> 01:20:56.060]   Yeah.
[01:20:56.060 --> 01:20:58.500]   Now, my mom and my stepdad are...
[01:20:58.500 --> 01:21:04.340]   They go every Saturday like it was a recreational hobby to the Apple Store to take training lessons
[01:21:04.340 --> 01:21:05.340]   for their...
[01:21:05.340 --> 01:21:06.340]   How much does this?
[01:21:06.340 --> 01:21:07.340]   They're right.
[01:21:07.340 --> 01:21:08.340]   They love the jeanuses.
[01:21:08.340 --> 01:21:11.620]   Their iPhone and their new MacBooks.
[01:21:11.620 --> 01:21:13.260]   And they go every time.
[01:21:13.260 --> 01:21:14.260]   They learn something.
[01:21:14.260 --> 01:21:15.260]   They love it.
[01:21:15.260 --> 01:21:16.260]   They enjoy it.
[01:21:16.260 --> 01:21:19.460]   They enjoy that experience, which is somewhat unique to Apple.
[01:21:19.460 --> 01:21:21.460]   You know, it is part of their identity.
[01:21:21.460 --> 01:21:24.780]   I thought of Microsoft, Sony and Samsung can have help it.
[01:21:24.780 --> 01:21:26.740]   All three of them have created stores.
[01:21:26.740 --> 01:21:27.740]   Don't look at the new book.
[01:21:27.740 --> 01:21:28.740]   It's nothing but nearly as successful.
[01:21:28.740 --> 01:21:29.740]   Yeah, we don't identify.
[01:21:29.740 --> 01:21:30.740]   No, I don't see.
[01:21:30.740 --> 01:21:33.220]   It's not easy to do, I guess.
[01:21:33.220 --> 01:21:35.180]   He reminded me of a lot of Apple Genius Subdo.
[01:21:35.180 --> 01:21:36.180]   I thought he...
[01:21:36.180 --> 01:21:37.180]   I don't know.
[01:21:37.180 --> 01:21:38.180]   I liked it.
[01:21:38.180 --> 01:21:39.180]   That was huge.
[01:21:39.180 --> 01:21:40.180]   That was huge.
[01:21:40.180 --> 01:21:41.180]   That was huge.
[01:21:41.180 --> 01:21:42.180]   Well, that's another story.
[01:21:42.180 --> 01:21:43.180]   Experts.
[01:21:43.180 --> 01:21:44.180]   Some of them...
[01:21:44.180 --> 01:21:45.180]   I ran it to one.
[01:21:45.180 --> 01:21:46.180]   I put up a...
[01:21:46.180 --> 01:21:47.180]   Someone had a tattoo of Apple on their arm.
[01:21:47.180 --> 01:21:48.180]   I said, "You're going a little too far."
[01:21:48.180 --> 01:21:49.180]   Oh, no.
[01:21:49.180 --> 01:21:50.180]   Wow.
[01:21:50.180 --> 01:21:51.180]   Look at this guy.
[01:21:51.180 --> 01:21:52.180]   He sleeps in his Apple shirt.
[01:21:52.180 --> 01:21:53.180]   He wears his Apple badge to the door.
[01:21:53.180 --> 01:21:54.180]   That's a door call.
[01:21:54.180 --> 01:21:55.180]   That's a door call.
[01:21:55.180 --> 01:21:56.180]   He's a nice boy.
[01:21:56.180 --> 01:21:57.180]   He's a nice boy.
[01:21:57.180 --> 01:21:58.180]   I think my kids to be nice and helpful like this.
[01:21:58.180 --> 01:21:59.180]   This is nice.
[01:21:59.180 --> 01:22:00.180]   He's a nice boy.
[01:22:00.180 --> 01:22:01.180]   He's a nice boy.
[01:22:01.180 --> 01:22:13.580]   One of the things I've learned through the years is do not underestimate Apple when they
[01:22:13.580 --> 01:22:18.620]   do something that seems odd or off-kilter.
[01:22:18.620 --> 01:22:25.580]   You go back and read all the people who panned the original iPad as an oversized iPhone and
[01:22:25.580 --> 01:22:26.580]   said it wouldn't work.
[01:22:26.580 --> 01:22:28.380]   It makes really interesting reading.
[01:22:28.380 --> 01:22:31.140]   You go back and look at those 2010 reviews.
[01:22:31.140 --> 01:22:33.180]   You can go back and look at the...
[01:22:33.180 --> 01:22:38.100]   Just from the product point of view, but also from the advertising point of view, I'm
[01:22:38.100 --> 01:22:43.900]   also sure that they've done plenty of research and maybe even some focus groups to get these
[01:22:43.900 --> 01:22:44.900]   ads.
[01:22:44.900 --> 01:22:45.900]   I'm sure.
[01:22:45.900 --> 01:22:46.900]   Yeah.
[01:22:46.900 --> 01:22:47.900]   Properly calibrated.
[01:22:47.900 --> 01:22:50.460]   The question is that they're not avant-garde.
[01:22:50.460 --> 01:22:51.460]   They're not avant-garde.
[01:22:51.460 --> 01:22:53.460]   It goes from a style of...
[01:22:53.460 --> 01:22:55.460]   They're not for the crazy ones.
[01:22:55.460 --> 01:22:56.460]   Yeah.
[01:22:56.460 --> 01:23:00.100]   It goes from a style of ads that you would imagine Don Draper pitching to an asylum ad
[01:23:00.100 --> 01:23:01.860]   that you would imagine Don Draper rejecting.
[01:23:01.860 --> 01:23:02.860]   Exactly.
[01:23:02.860 --> 01:23:03.860]   I'm not saying that...
[01:23:03.860 --> 01:23:04.860]   Those were Draper rejects.
[01:23:04.860 --> 01:23:05.860]   Yeah.
[01:23:05.860 --> 01:23:09.220]   Peggy would come in there and he would just coolly look at her and just miss her from the
[01:23:09.220 --> 01:23:12.380]   office if she brought up the Apple Genius thing.
[01:23:12.380 --> 01:23:19.380]   So I think they're fine.
[01:23:19.380 --> 01:23:19.860]   I just think that they're not aimed at a different set of humanity.
[01:23:19.860 --> 01:23:22.380]   I think it is a set of humanity that watches the Olympics.
[01:23:22.380 --> 01:23:27.340]   You have just a wide variety of people that are watching these games and that's who they're
[01:23:27.340 --> 01:23:29.140]   trying to talk to.
[01:23:29.140 --> 01:23:30.140]   Yeah.
[01:23:30.140 --> 01:23:31.140]   Yeah.
[01:23:31.140 --> 01:23:33.940]   We're going to talk when we come back.
[01:23:33.940 --> 01:23:39.980]   Apparently, Henry Blodgett doesn't share your respect for Apple at bot.
[01:23:39.980 --> 01:23:43.380]   He says the iPhone 5 is going to be a disaster.
[01:23:43.380 --> 01:23:44.940]   Oh wait a minute.
[01:23:44.940 --> 01:23:46.580]   Let's get this one here real quickly.
[01:23:46.580 --> 01:23:47.880]   Oh no.
[01:23:47.880 --> 01:23:48.880]   This is an Apple.
[01:23:48.880 --> 01:23:49.880]   This is a Microsoft ad.
[01:23:49.880 --> 01:23:50.880]   I don't think this ad ever aired.
[01:23:50.880 --> 01:23:54.140]   How much do you think this is an operating environment is worth?
[01:23:54.140 --> 01:23:56.580]   Wait just one minute before you answer.
[01:23:56.580 --> 01:23:57.580]   Watch this Windows.
[01:23:57.580 --> 01:24:00.540]   It integrates Flodus 123 with Miami Vice.
[01:24:00.540 --> 01:24:04.620]   Now we can take this Ferrari and paste it right into Windows White.
[01:24:04.620 --> 01:24:07.220]   Now how much do you think Microsoft Windows is worth?
[01:24:07.220 --> 01:24:08.220]   Don't answer.
[01:24:08.220 --> 01:24:09.620]   Wait until you see Windows right.
[01:24:09.620 --> 01:24:11.940]   It's a Windows Paint and it listens to what else you want.
[01:24:11.940 --> 01:24:17.420]   Steve Ballmer in a very ill-fitting suit and it looks like Windows 1.0 actually.
[01:24:17.420 --> 01:24:19.420]   I don't know what version of one is.
[01:24:19.420 --> 01:24:22.900]   It's one of the ads they do for their sales conference.
[01:24:22.900 --> 01:24:23.900]   Right.
[01:24:23.900 --> 01:24:28.420]   There's so many great ads and I would somewhere I wish they were in archive.
[01:24:28.420 --> 01:24:33.100]   The CES ads too that they used to remember the one with Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer
[01:24:33.100 --> 01:24:35.060]   driving a Volkswagen.
[01:24:35.060 --> 01:24:41.460]   And they see an old Sun micro server sitting by the road and they throw it in the backseat
[01:24:41.460 --> 01:24:43.260]   and it starts to smell.
[01:24:43.260 --> 01:24:50.500]   They did a good one for D1 year with the guy from Napoleon Dynamite.
[01:24:50.500 --> 01:24:51.500]   Dynamite.
[01:24:51.500 --> 01:24:52.500]   Oh wow.
[01:24:52.500 --> 01:24:53.500]   That's great.
[01:24:53.500 --> 01:24:54.500]   That's good stuff.
[01:24:54.500 --> 01:24:55.500]   I like that stuff.
[01:24:55.500 --> 01:25:00.340]   And unfortunately because of rights issues most of that stuff never surfaces, never sees
[01:25:00.340 --> 01:25:01.340]   the news.
[01:25:01.340 --> 01:25:02.340]   Yeah unfortunately.
[01:25:02.340 --> 01:25:04.140]   We had a wonderful one from Kodak that is I wish we could use.
[01:25:04.140 --> 01:25:06.660]   We don't have the rights to it but it's wonderful.
[01:25:06.660 --> 01:25:07.660]   Exactly.
[01:25:07.660 --> 01:25:08.660]   We'll take a break.
[01:25:08.660 --> 01:25:09.660]   We'll come back in just a bit.
[01:25:09.660 --> 01:25:10.660]   Talk about the iPhone 5.
[01:25:10.660 --> 01:25:11.660]   There's lots.
[01:25:11.660 --> 01:25:12.820]   There's a ton of news this week.
[01:25:12.820 --> 01:25:13.820]   We'll get to it all.
[01:25:13.820 --> 01:25:21.780]   I promise you the Olympics and Twitter and NBC and oh there's more.
[01:25:21.780 --> 01:25:22.780]   The new dig.
[01:25:22.780 --> 01:25:23.780]   We'll talk.
[01:25:23.780 --> 01:25:24.940]   The new cloud player from Amazon.
[01:25:24.940 --> 01:25:30.780]   But first let me take you on a little visit to something I want to do with Steve Martin
[01:25:30.780 --> 01:25:32.220]   here and say the new square space is here.
[01:25:32.220 --> 01:25:34.220]   The new square space is here.
[01:25:34.220 --> 01:25:35.220]   Very exciting.
[01:25:35.220 --> 01:25:37.620]   Square space 6 has launched.
[01:25:37.620 --> 01:25:40.020]   Now you know we talk about square space all the time.
[01:25:40.020 --> 01:25:43.620]   These simply put the best hosting for your site ever.
[01:25:43.620 --> 01:25:44.620]   Fantastic.
[01:25:44.620 --> 01:25:50.980]   But now, now it's even better because the new square space content management system
[01:25:50.980 --> 01:25:51.980]   is launched.
[01:25:51.980 --> 01:25:55.140]   Square space 6 that just makes it, it's very modern.
[01:25:55.140 --> 01:25:57.300]   The templates are gorgeous.
[01:25:57.300 --> 01:26:00.860]   They're using, they're doing something now called responsive design which we spent on
[01:26:00.860 --> 01:26:05.340]   our new site over $100,000 to do.
[01:26:05.340 --> 01:26:09.060]   You can get this for $8 a month.
[01:26:09.060 --> 01:26:12.420]   So the idea of responsive design and it makes sense in this world where everybody's
[01:26:12.420 --> 01:26:16.420]   mobile is that your page looks the same no matter what the device is.
[01:26:16.420 --> 01:26:19.300]   It resizes appropriately.
[01:26:19.300 --> 01:26:24.420]   That's why for instance when you drag an image to square space, it generates seven different
[01:26:24.420 --> 01:26:27.420]   sizes, one for every appropriate device.
[01:26:27.420 --> 01:26:28.420]   So it looks great.
[01:26:28.420 --> 01:26:33.060]   It looks great on everything from a 27 inch screen to a 3.5 inch iPhone.
[01:26:33.060 --> 01:26:35.220]   The ability to drag and drop and design.
[01:26:35.220 --> 01:26:41.180]   I know you guys on NSFW, you let one shot square space sites all the time.
[01:26:41.180 --> 01:26:44.460]   Yeah, well because square space offers the free.
[01:26:44.460 --> 01:26:46.980]   You get two weeks free with no credit card or anything.
[01:26:46.980 --> 01:26:50.540]   Yeah, so on our show we have people make funny websites all the time.
[01:26:50.540 --> 01:26:53.340]   And really I think square space we've talked to them and they love.
[01:26:53.340 --> 01:26:54.340]   They don't mind.
[01:26:54.340 --> 01:26:57.900]   Yeah, because they love people getting to use the tools so when they know that they
[01:26:57.900 --> 01:27:01.940]   want to go and have a serious project that they want to use this product, they know how
[01:27:01.940 --> 01:27:04.460]   to use it, they're familiar with everything that they can do.
[01:27:04.460 --> 01:27:08.420]   And let me tell you this, that responsive design stuff, this is only like maybe two
[01:27:08.420 --> 01:27:13.420]   years ago my friends at an upstatement which is a fantastic design firm out in Boston.
[01:27:13.420 --> 01:27:19.100]   Very good friends of mine just did the Boston Globe redesign that introduced that idea.
[01:27:19.100 --> 01:27:20.100]   Oh really?
[01:27:20.100 --> 01:27:21.100]   That's where that came from.
[01:27:21.100 --> 01:27:23.300]   Yeah, and now this is available at a consumer level.
[01:27:23.300 --> 01:27:24.300]   Yeah.
[01:27:24.300 --> 01:27:25.300]   And that's insane.
[01:27:25.300 --> 01:27:26.300]   That's great.
[01:27:26.300 --> 01:27:29.460]   That is extraordinarily hard.
[01:27:29.460 --> 01:27:32.740]   And it is so well done on the new square space.
[01:27:32.740 --> 01:27:33.740]   What's nice?
[01:27:33.740 --> 01:27:34.980]   No two square space sites look alike.
[01:27:34.980 --> 01:27:39.180]   You can't tell it's a square space site that you have the 300 plus Google type fonts,
[01:27:39.180 --> 01:27:41.580]   the really easy customization.
[01:27:41.580 --> 01:27:47.140]   But also if you know CSS, you know, they've got a pop out CSS editor with the code coloring
[01:27:47.140 --> 01:27:48.140]   and all that stuff.
[01:27:48.140 --> 01:27:55.260]   So it's really, this is an entirely new product completely rewritten, brand new code base,
[01:27:55.260 --> 01:27:59.580]   HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript Foundations.
[01:27:59.580 --> 01:28:02.460]   This is the best and it's hosting plus the software.
[01:28:02.460 --> 01:28:06.700]   So you're going to get an incredible site and the best part is the pricing.
[01:28:06.700 --> 01:28:08.700]   So let me exit out of this video.
[01:28:08.700 --> 01:28:13.180]   And by the way, workshops.squarespace.com, they've got training free for you so you can
[01:28:13.180 --> 01:28:16.340]   take webinars and learn how to use this.
[01:28:16.340 --> 01:28:24.300]   But if you go to squarespace.com right now, you can sign up for a free account two weeks
[01:28:24.300 --> 01:28:28.700]   free, do everything, all the features, import your blog from WordPress type pattern, blogger
[01:28:28.700 --> 01:28:29.900]   and all that.
[01:28:29.900 --> 01:28:35.620]   But then if you decide you like it, the pricing is phenomenal.
[01:28:35.620 --> 01:28:37.140]   And I don't know how they're doing this.
[01:28:37.140 --> 01:28:38.620]   They have yearly plans.
[01:28:38.620 --> 01:28:39.740]   They have month to month plans.
[01:28:39.740 --> 01:28:41.260]   The best deal of course is the yearly plan.
[01:28:41.260 --> 01:28:43.820]   In fact, it's an extra special good deal.
[01:28:43.820 --> 01:28:50.220]   If you use the offer code TWIT8, TWIT8 for the month of August, the eighth month, TWIT8
[01:28:50.220 --> 01:28:52.140]   because we'll give you 10% off your first purchase.
[01:28:52.140 --> 01:28:55.500]   So if you buy a yearly plan, that's 10% off for the whole year.
[01:28:55.500 --> 01:28:58.980]   And look at these prices, the basic plan, $8 a month.
[01:28:58.980 --> 01:29:01.980]   But the deal really here to me is $16 a month.
[01:29:01.980 --> 01:29:08.700]   You get unlimited pages, galleries and blogs, unlimited bandwidth, unlimited storage, unlimited
[01:29:08.700 --> 01:29:09.700]   contributors.
[01:29:09.700 --> 01:29:13.860]   It is a pro site for $16 a month.
[01:29:13.860 --> 01:29:15.380]   And then apply the TWIT8 offer code.
[01:29:15.380 --> 01:29:17.140]   You can take 10% off of that.
[01:29:17.140 --> 01:29:22.220]   They'll also hook you up automatically with your custom domain so you can have that domain
[01:29:22.220 --> 01:29:23.900]   name that goes that you pick.
[01:29:23.900 --> 01:29:24.900]   They'll register it for you.
[01:29:24.900 --> 01:29:28.140]   They'll hook it up and make it all at no charge.
[01:29:28.140 --> 01:29:30.580]   Squarespace.com, a new Squarespace is here.
[01:29:30.580 --> 01:29:31.820]   And you've got to try this.
[01:29:31.820 --> 01:29:32.980]   You've got to try this.
[01:29:32.980 --> 01:29:35.940]   Squarespace.com, if you decide to buy, just do me a favor.
[01:29:35.940 --> 01:29:42.380]   Use the offer code TWIT8 and you'll save 10%.
[01:29:42.380 --> 01:29:44.380]   Love it.
[01:29:44.380 --> 01:29:52.300]   Facebook's stock down to under $20 now.
[01:29:52.300 --> 01:29:56.420]   Is that the right price or are they a deal?
[01:29:56.420 --> 01:29:59.340]   It's probably the right price because it's the price.
[01:29:59.340 --> 01:30:00.340]   That's the price.
[01:30:00.340 --> 01:30:01.460]   Well, it is the right price for now.
[01:30:01.460 --> 01:30:04.660]   But I'm just wondering if there's an upside to buying Facebook.
[01:30:04.660 --> 01:30:06.420]   I don't buy tech stock and I can't.
[01:30:06.420 --> 01:30:07.660]   So I don't know and I don't care.
[01:30:07.660 --> 01:30:12.060]   If you look at P.E. multiples, it's actually still pricey.
[01:30:12.060 --> 01:30:13.060]   But Amazon is too.
[01:30:13.060 --> 01:30:14.660]   Yeah, they all are.
[01:30:14.660 --> 01:30:15.860]   I'm not Apple and Google.
[01:30:15.860 --> 01:30:17.300]   They're very quite-- I think they're 10.
[01:30:17.300 --> 01:30:18.300]   But they're all companies.
[01:30:18.300 --> 01:30:19.660]   They've been around a long time.
[01:30:19.660 --> 01:30:22.140]   Yeah, they're doing rather well, aren't they?
[01:30:22.140 --> 01:30:25.540]   I think that the two of them are really strong companies now
[01:30:25.540 --> 01:30:28.580]   in terms of profits and revenues.
[01:30:28.580 --> 01:30:30.300]   If you're looking at it as a growth stock,
[01:30:30.300 --> 01:30:31.820]   it's not very good price.
[01:30:31.820 --> 01:30:33.700]   If you're looking at it as maybe there's some problems,
[01:30:33.700 --> 01:30:35.620]   it's perfectly priced.
[01:30:35.620 --> 01:30:36.340]   I think we'll see.
[01:30:36.340 --> 01:30:39.740]   I think they've got to start showing some real growth
[01:30:39.740 --> 01:30:41.900]   in their revenue, like heavy growth.
[01:30:41.900 --> 01:30:45.020]   And users is harder because they've sort of reached almost
[01:30:45.020 --> 01:30:47.100]   as many users as they can get to, probably.
[01:30:47.100 --> 01:30:49.260]   Well, and we've seen some revelations in there.
[01:30:49.260 --> 01:30:54.420]   10K, they said, 83 million of their accounts are bogus.
[01:30:54.420 --> 01:30:57.060]   They're spam or duplicates or mistakes.
[01:30:57.060 --> 01:30:59.460]   And that seems actually low to me.
[01:30:59.460 --> 01:31:01.460]   That actually seems pretty good.
[01:31:01.460 --> 01:31:03.220]   That's only like 10%.
[01:31:03.220 --> 01:31:04.180]   Yeah, I like that.
[01:31:04.180 --> 01:31:04.660]   I think you use--
[01:31:04.660 --> 01:31:05.860]   7%.
[01:31:05.860 --> 01:31:06.380]   Yeah.
[01:31:06.380 --> 01:31:07.620]   I like that you use revelations.
[01:31:07.620 --> 01:31:09.500]   Revelations.
[01:31:09.500 --> 01:31:11.220]   Well, maybe not such a revelation,
[01:31:11.220 --> 01:31:12.500]   especially if you were in the know.
[01:31:12.500 --> 01:31:16.380]   But they also said our ad sales are softening.
[01:31:16.380 --> 01:31:18.500]   We're down again.
[01:31:18.500 --> 01:31:19.900]   I'll tell you what, I found--
[01:31:19.900 --> 01:31:22.300]   I actually had a very positive ad experience on Facebook
[01:31:22.300 --> 01:31:22.700]   the other day.
[01:31:22.700 --> 01:31:23.700]   I found--
[01:31:23.700 --> 01:31:25.780]   Did you buy an ad for the Diamond Club?
[01:31:25.780 --> 01:31:26.380]   For the Diamond Club?
[01:31:26.380 --> 01:31:27.340]   No, no.
[01:31:27.340 --> 01:31:28.540]   We have not bought any ads.
[01:31:28.540 --> 01:31:28.540]   No ads.
[01:31:28.540 --> 01:31:29.540]   You haven't bought any ads.
[01:31:29.540 --> 01:31:30.980]   What am I-- I'm not--
[01:31:30.980 --> 01:31:32.980]   I mean, Patricia Hargins Bradley is the writer of the--
[01:31:32.980 --> 01:31:33.500]   I'm sorry.
[01:31:33.500 --> 01:31:35.100]   I keep conflating the two of you.
[01:31:35.100 --> 01:31:36.100]   I'm just a fan, you know?
[01:31:36.100 --> 01:31:38.100]   Yeah.
[01:31:38.100 --> 01:31:38.460]   I'll say so.
[01:31:38.460 --> 01:31:39.860]   I bought this poster.
[01:31:39.860 --> 01:31:42.420]   It was like a Spark Art poster or something of their--
[01:31:42.420 --> 01:31:43.900]   They did a screening of Blazing Saddles.
[01:31:43.900 --> 01:31:44.660]   I love Blazing Saddles.
[01:31:44.660 --> 01:31:46.460]   So I bought their specialty thing.
[01:31:46.460 --> 01:31:50.180]   And then the next day, literally, my entire timeline
[01:31:50.180 --> 01:31:51.500]   was Spark Art Post.
[01:31:51.500 --> 01:31:52.020]   Wow.
[01:31:52.020 --> 01:31:54.580]   It was like it went from me being like, hey,
[01:31:54.580 --> 01:31:55.660]   that was great.
[01:31:55.660 --> 01:31:58.140]   I had a great buying experience.
[01:31:58.140 --> 01:31:59.100]   Thanks to Facebook.
[01:31:59.100 --> 01:32:00.260]   Cheers to you guys.
[01:32:00.260 --> 01:32:01.300]   You guys are awesome.
[01:32:01.300 --> 01:32:03.260]   To the next day being like, you could not
[01:32:03.260 --> 01:32:04.940]   have ruined this anymore.
[01:32:04.940 --> 01:32:05.940]   Wow.
[01:32:05.940 --> 01:32:06.900]   Oh dear.
[01:32:06.900 --> 01:32:08.500]   It was probably just automated too.
[01:32:08.500 --> 01:32:09.420]   Yeah.
[01:32:09.420 --> 01:32:10.460]   I get gay cruises.
[01:32:10.460 --> 01:32:12.940]   I'm not even going to click on any of those.
[01:32:12.940 --> 01:32:13.540]   Well, you know it's weird.
[01:32:13.540 --> 01:32:14.860]   I get gay cruises.
[01:32:14.860 --> 01:32:15.780]   Maybe it's the police outfit.
[01:32:15.780 --> 01:32:16.260]   Well, let's go.
[01:32:16.260 --> 01:32:17.140]   Let's do you and I go.
[01:32:17.140 --> 01:32:17.780]   That would be fun.
[01:32:17.780 --> 01:32:20.260]   I'm a much show, much show, man.
[01:32:20.260 --> 01:32:22.020]   That'd be one hell of a gay cruise.
[01:32:22.020 --> 01:32:23.980]   I would pay him to go on a gay cruise with you, Leo.
[01:32:23.980 --> 01:32:24.340]   Why?
[01:32:24.340 --> 01:32:25.660]   What would be fun about that?
[01:32:25.660 --> 01:32:27.540]   You would be a lot of fun on a gay cruise.
[01:32:27.540 --> 01:32:28.020]   You just would.
[01:32:28.020 --> 01:32:28.660]   What is a gay cruise?
[01:32:28.660 --> 01:32:30.220]   Have you been on a gay cruise?
[01:32:30.220 --> 01:32:30.940]   I have.
[01:32:30.940 --> 01:32:32.580]   What is a gay cruise like?
[01:32:32.580 --> 01:32:34.740]   Well, I went on a lesbian one once.
[01:32:34.740 --> 01:32:36.380]   I'd like to go on a lesbian cruise.
[01:32:36.380 --> 01:32:38.060]   A bunch of gay people on a boat.
[01:32:38.060 --> 01:32:39.380]   I don't want to tell you.
[01:32:39.380 --> 01:32:41.380]   Sorry.
[01:32:41.380 --> 01:32:44.060]   The lesbians are different than the gay men.
[01:32:44.060 --> 01:32:44.700]   They're different.
[01:32:44.700 --> 01:32:46.180]   I've never been on a gay man cruise.
[01:32:46.180 --> 01:32:46.820]   I don't know.
[01:32:46.820 --> 01:32:47.180]   Yeah.
[01:32:47.180 --> 01:32:48.300]   Well, OK.
[01:32:48.300 --> 01:32:49.700]   You can go out of dream.
[01:32:49.700 --> 01:32:50.940]   It's hard to dream.
[01:32:50.940 --> 01:32:51.780]   So I'm looking--
[01:32:51.780 --> 01:32:52.740]   But with you, I would do it.
[01:32:52.740 --> 01:32:53.380]   It would be fun.
[01:32:53.380 --> 01:32:54.980]   All right, deal.
[01:32:54.980 --> 01:32:57.740]   I don't know how you can explain that to Megan, but OK.
[01:32:57.740 --> 01:32:59.460]   I wish you'll be fine, believe me.
[01:32:59.460 --> 01:33:04.180]   Now, if you could arrange to do a Twit broadcast from the cruise--
[01:33:04.180 --> 01:33:05.300]   Oh, my God.
[01:33:05.300 --> 01:33:05.820]   That would be fun.
[01:33:05.820 --> 01:33:06.340]   I'll do that.
[01:33:06.340 --> 01:33:07.620]   We've done a Twit on a cruise.
[01:33:07.620 --> 01:33:08.620]   No, that would be fabulous.
[01:33:08.620 --> 01:33:11.140]   We've done Twit on a cruise before.
[01:33:11.140 --> 01:33:11.700]   We have its--
[01:33:11.700 --> 01:33:13.860]   Big users of technology, big early users.
[01:33:13.860 --> 01:33:16.580]   I had a chapter in my first book about AOL.
[01:33:16.580 --> 01:33:17.820]   It was the gay community.
[01:33:17.820 --> 01:33:20.220]   It was intercomedy growth of AOL.
[01:33:20.220 --> 01:33:21.660]   Oh, it's huge.
[01:33:21.660 --> 01:33:22.780]   It was really important.
[01:33:22.780 --> 01:33:23.900]   Very early adopters.
[01:33:23.900 --> 01:33:24.940]   Well-educated.
[01:33:24.940 --> 01:33:26.580]   Heavy users of-- yes, heavy users of--
[01:33:26.580 --> 01:33:27.900]   Disposable income.
[01:33:27.900 --> 01:33:31.220]   It's everything you dream of and more.
[01:33:31.220 --> 01:33:31.900]   Diamond club.
[01:33:31.900 --> 01:33:33.420]   Highly innovation.
[01:33:33.420 --> 01:33:34.140]   Diamond club.
[01:33:34.140 --> 01:33:35.220]   Diamond club.
[01:33:35.220 --> 01:33:35.620]   Yes.
[01:33:35.620 --> 01:33:36.260]   I don't know.
[01:33:36.260 --> 01:33:40.460]   There may be some stuff going on here,
[01:33:40.460 --> 01:33:43.660]   but I'm liking this Diamond club.
[01:33:43.660 --> 01:33:46.660]   So this is-- let me just show you a little bit.
[01:33:46.660 --> 01:33:49.740]   I'll go to my books because I, of course, have a copy.
[01:33:49.740 --> 01:33:51.780]   Patricia Harkins Bradley, she tweeted me.
[01:33:51.780 --> 01:33:53.420]   I was really-- I have to say--
[01:33:53.420 --> 01:33:54.260]   Starstruck, right?
[01:33:54.260 --> 01:33:54.900]   Starstruck.
[01:33:54.900 --> 01:33:56.940]   Oh, I can't-- oh, you know, this is a flaw, by the way,
[01:33:56.940 --> 01:33:58.100]   in iBooks.
[01:33:58.100 --> 01:33:59.500]   I cannot open this on a desktop.
[01:33:59.500 --> 01:34:01.540]   I have to go do it on a mobile device.
[01:34:01.540 --> 01:34:02.300]   I have it.
[01:34:02.300 --> 01:34:03.500]   I download it.
[01:34:03.500 --> 01:34:05.340]   But I have to sync it with an iPhone or an iPad.
[01:34:05.340 --> 01:34:06.420]   I have to read the book.
[01:34:06.420 --> 01:34:08.060]   Well, yeah, it goes wild, I see, right?
[01:34:08.060 --> 01:34:08.940]   Through iCloud.
[01:34:08.940 --> 01:34:09.900]   Well, I don't care.
[01:34:09.900 --> 01:34:11.500]   I have it on my computer.
[01:34:11.500 --> 01:34:12.420]   I want to read it.
[01:34:12.420 --> 01:34:12.940]   You get it.
[01:34:12.940 --> 01:34:15.300]   When you have a craving for Diamond club,
[01:34:15.300 --> 01:34:16.980]   it needs to be satisfied.
[01:34:16.980 --> 01:34:19.380]   It needs to be sated, post-haste.
[01:34:19.380 --> 01:34:20.620]   So what's the story with this?
[01:34:20.620 --> 01:34:21.380]   OK.
[01:34:21.380 --> 01:34:24.340]   This is a-- well, I'll read the description
[01:34:24.340 --> 01:34:27.980]   when Priana Young discovers that Roman Dial, the man she
[01:34:27.980 --> 01:34:30.900]   built her relationship and a multimillion dollar company
[01:34:30.900 --> 01:34:33.100]   with, has gotten married to another woman.
[01:34:33.100 --> 01:34:34.420]   He texts her.
[01:34:34.420 --> 01:34:35.500]   No, she gets the text.
[01:34:35.500 --> 01:34:37.100]   She finds out on the social network
[01:34:37.100 --> 01:34:39.340]   that they both built, fullydatable.com.
[01:34:39.340 --> 01:34:39.700]   Wait a minute.
[01:34:39.700 --> 01:34:40.580]   Here's a--
[01:34:40.580 --> 01:34:41.020]   Thank you.
[01:34:41.020 --> 01:34:44.780]   Apparently, our entire staff has purchased this book.
[01:34:44.780 --> 01:34:45.740]   They're not alone.
[01:34:45.740 --> 01:34:46.580]   Yeah.
[01:34:46.580 --> 01:34:47.900]   No, and it's a great-- well, no.
[01:34:47.900 --> 01:34:49.300]   How many do you have sales figures?
[01:34:49.300 --> 01:34:50.500]   I have numbers for you.
[01:34:50.500 --> 01:34:50.780]   All right.
[01:34:50.780 --> 01:34:53.220]   Do catch people up on what exactly this is about?
[01:34:53.220 --> 01:34:54.820]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:34:54.820 --> 01:34:55.500]   No, you don't want him?
[01:34:55.500 --> 01:34:55.860]   OK.
[01:34:55.860 --> 01:34:58.540]   Not until we've really teased the hell out of him.
[01:34:58.540 --> 01:35:01.220]   So here, if you look, this is the book on an iPad,
[01:35:01.220 --> 01:35:03.980]   where really it is better for one-handed reading.
[01:35:03.980 --> 01:35:04.980]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:35:04.980 --> 01:35:06.220]   Here is-- here is--
[01:35:06.220 --> 01:35:06.720]   Patricia.
[01:35:06.720 --> 01:35:07.220]   That's Patty.
[01:35:07.220 --> 01:35:08.140]   Patricia Harkins Bradley.
[01:35:08.140 --> 01:35:09.780]   Now, she's a little shy, because--
[01:35:09.780 --> 01:35:10.780]   There's a shy lady.
[01:35:10.780 --> 01:35:13.060]   She's hiding behind a bush or something there.
[01:35:13.060 --> 01:35:13.900]   I think it's a tree.
[01:35:13.900 --> 01:35:16.060]   She's an English teacher and ex-wife, mother
[01:35:16.060 --> 01:35:17.660]   of three in San Francisco.
[01:35:17.660 --> 01:35:20.740]   But I have to say, when you read the first few pages--
[01:35:20.740 --> 01:35:21.980]   I wish they had a sample.
[01:35:21.980 --> 01:35:22.980]   Do they have a sample?
[01:35:22.980 --> 01:35:23.540]   Yeah, they have a sample.
[01:35:23.540 --> 01:35:24.040]   Yeah.
[01:35:24.040 --> 01:35:25.540]   Because you should really--
[01:35:25.540 --> 01:35:26.900]   You bastard.
[01:35:26.900 --> 01:35:29.020]   I would have sworn the person next to me said the words.
[01:35:29.020 --> 01:35:32.100]   But they came from my mouth, my body, my soul,
[01:35:32.100 --> 01:35:35.180]   my right hand that dropped the cup of overpriced coffee,
[01:35:35.180 --> 01:35:36.700]   probably a tall, maybe a venti--
[01:35:36.700 --> 01:35:37.380]   Maybe a venti, yeah.
[01:35:37.380 --> 01:35:39.140]   On my well-worn converse sneakers,
[01:35:39.140 --> 01:35:41.220]   my left hand dropped my iPhone on the concrete,
[01:35:41.220 --> 01:35:44.460]   sending it dancing down the street, my iPhone.
[01:35:44.460 --> 01:35:45.660]   That's where I read it.
[01:35:45.660 --> 01:35:48.180]   Just a few simple words that changed my life forever.
[01:35:48.180 --> 01:35:50.740]   One simple push message that sounded
[01:35:50.740 --> 01:35:54.780]   the custom chime of my fully-datable app, Roman Dial,
[01:35:54.780 --> 01:35:59.140]   is now married to Bonnie Barrow, married, not engaged,
[01:35:59.140 --> 01:35:59.980]   married.
[01:35:59.980 --> 01:36:01.420]   We're in the best line in here.
[01:36:01.420 --> 01:36:03.820]   Is this like 50 Shades of Grey for geeks?
[01:36:03.820 --> 01:36:05.820]   Exactly.
[01:36:05.820 --> 01:36:08.460]   And by the way, number five, it was number four.
[01:36:08.460 --> 01:36:10.500]   But today, just a couple hours ago,
[01:36:10.500 --> 01:36:12.540]   I dropped from number four to number five.
[01:36:12.540 --> 01:36:16.340]   On the iBook store-- I mean, of all books, which is kind of sad
[01:36:16.340 --> 01:36:17.860]   because it was dominating.
[01:36:17.860 --> 01:36:20.100]   There's a big market for this.
[01:36:20.100 --> 01:36:21.140]   This is so much better.
[01:36:21.140 --> 01:36:22.580]   I don't know if you read 50 Shades of Grey.
[01:36:22.580 --> 01:36:22.900]   I did.
[01:36:22.900 --> 01:36:24.020]   No, you know I didn't.
[01:36:24.020 --> 01:36:25.660]   I'm like one of the last people in the room.
[01:36:25.660 --> 01:36:27.180]   This is so much better.
[01:36:27.180 --> 01:36:29.620]   Listen, listen to this line.
[01:36:29.620 --> 01:36:30.140]   Where is it?
[01:36:30.140 --> 01:36:32.940]   Where's the one about the friend accepting his friend?
[01:36:32.940 --> 01:36:34.900]   Yeah, no, here we go.
[01:36:34.900 --> 01:36:36.420]   I can have it speak it.
[01:36:36.420 --> 01:36:36.820]   There we go.
[01:36:36.820 --> 01:36:39.140]   It starts with Roman Dial's soft brown hair.
[01:36:39.140 --> 01:36:41.500]   Roman Dial's-- wait a minute, let me just select the whole thing
[01:36:41.500 --> 01:36:44.700]   and let the iPad do what it does best.
[01:36:44.700 --> 01:36:46.220]   Let's have the iPad read this.
[01:36:46.220 --> 01:36:47.220]   Oh, no.
[01:36:47.220 --> 01:36:48.220]   [INAUDIBLE]
[01:36:48.220 --> 01:36:49.220]   Maybe slow down.
[01:36:49.220 --> 01:36:49.980]   No, slow down.
[01:36:49.980 --> 01:36:50.660]   Do it again.
[01:36:50.660 --> 01:36:52.660]   [INAUDIBLE]
[01:36:52.660 --> 01:36:53.500]   Oh, all right.
[01:36:53.500 --> 01:36:54.220]   That's enough.
[01:36:54.220 --> 01:36:55.220]   And we're moving on.
[01:36:55.220 --> 01:36:55.820]   [INAUDIBLE]
[01:36:55.820 --> 01:36:56.820]   [INAUDIBLE]
[01:36:56.820 --> 01:36:57.820]   [INAUDIBLE]
[01:36:57.820 --> 01:37:01.860]   Accepted his friend request between my alabaster thighs.
[01:37:01.860 --> 01:37:05.980]   It's not as sexy when the iPad says you.
[01:37:05.980 --> 01:37:06.780]   It's better.
[01:37:06.780 --> 01:37:07.820]   It's better.
[01:37:07.820 --> 01:37:09.580]   Yeah.
[01:37:09.580 --> 01:37:11.700]   So all right, sales figures.
[01:37:11.700 --> 01:37:13.260]   We are all--
[01:37:13.260 --> 01:37:15.300]   There's a reason, Cara, while we're talking about this.
[01:37:15.300 --> 01:37:15.900]   You'll learn.
[01:37:15.900 --> 01:37:16.980]   I get it.
[01:37:16.980 --> 01:37:17.980]   Are you getting it already?
[01:37:17.980 --> 01:37:18.980]   You're getting it, I think.
[01:37:18.980 --> 01:37:19.580]   I got it a law.
[01:37:19.580 --> 01:37:21.140]   I got it when I heard alabaster.
[01:37:21.140 --> 01:37:22.340]   You're so smart.
[01:37:22.340 --> 01:37:23.220]   You're so smart.
[01:37:23.220 --> 01:37:25.460]   You cannot fool you.
[01:37:25.460 --> 01:37:27.860]   What the hell has alabaster thighs?
[01:37:27.860 --> 01:37:29.900]   People in romance novels.
[01:37:29.900 --> 01:37:31.060]   I have alabaster thighs.
[01:37:31.060 --> 01:37:34.060]   You know that if you went on a gay cruise with me.
[01:37:34.060 --> 01:37:36.580]   Well, you'd have son abuse thighs in the race.
[01:37:36.580 --> 01:37:38.300]   Yeah, well, I like short shorts.
[01:37:38.300 --> 01:37:39.300]   Alabaster.
[01:37:39.300 --> 01:37:41.260]   What's alabaster if you went on a cruise?
[01:37:41.260 --> 01:37:42.460]   All right, do you want to explain it?
[01:37:42.460 --> 01:37:43.660]   Or do you want me to say how many--
[01:37:43.660 --> 01:37:44.860]   What are the sales figures?
[01:37:44.860 --> 01:37:46.020]   OK.
[01:37:46.020 --> 01:37:48.780]   I can say that it's, in fact, over 9,000.
[01:37:48.780 --> 01:37:50.380]   Cheese, the least.
[01:37:50.380 --> 01:37:51.460]   Now, it's 99 cents.
[01:37:51.460 --> 01:37:54.180]   So it's a considerable deal compared to the $9.99
[01:37:54.180 --> 01:37:55.220]   50 chance of break.
[01:37:55.220 --> 01:37:58.220]   In fact, as of yesterday, we're getting--
[01:37:58.220 --> 01:38:00.180]   still, we haven't got the stuff for today.
[01:38:00.180 --> 01:38:05.180]   But it is over 12,000 copies that have been sold
[01:38:05.180 --> 01:38:06.580]   since we put it up on Monday.
[01:38:06.580 --> 01:38:07.740]   Now, where does the money go?
[01:38:07.740 --> 01:38:10.140]   Because I know it doesn't go to Patricia Harkins, Bradley.
[01:38:10.140 --> 01:38:10.860]   Well, yeah.
[01:38:10.860 --> 01:38:12.500]   Can I explain what this is?
[01:38:12.500 --> 01:38:13.620]   All right, so here's the deal.
[01:38:13.620 --> 01:38:16.580]   About a month and a half ago, Brian Brushwood, my co-host
[01:38:16.580 --> 01:38:19.220]   on NSFW show, released Scam School Book 2,
[01:38:19.220 --> 01:38:22.580]   and realized that the top 10 of the iBook store
[01:38:22.580 --> 01:38:26.820]   was a ton of super cheap erotic fiction
[01:38:26.820 --> 01:38:29.260]   since "50 Shades of Grey," came out.
[01:38:29.260 --> 01:38:30.980]   Totally changed the publishing world.
[01:38:30.980 --> 01:38:31.580]   Absolutely.
[01:38:31.580 --> 01:38:32.100]   Yeah.
[01:38:32.100 --> 01:38:33.500]   So John Tilt had an idea, and it kind of
[01:38:33.500 --> 01:38:35.180]   matched with something that I had just read about,
[01:38:35.180 --> 01:38:38.820]   which I found fascinating, which was back in 1969,
[01:38:38.820 --> 01:38:42.460]   Mike McGrady of the newspaper, "Newsday,"
[01:38:42.460 --> 01:38:43.780]   released a--
[01:38:43.780 --> 01:38:46.220]   teamed with 18 other writers to each separately write
[01:38:46.220 --> 01:38:49.780]   a chapter of a romance novel, because those were really
[01:38:49.780 --> 01:38:50.460]   coming to the mode.
[01:38:50.460 --> 01:38:51.460]   Naked came the stranger.
[01:38:51.460 --> 01:38:52.820]   Naked came the stranger.
[01:38:52.820 --> 01:38:53.660]   That was the name of the book.
[01:38:53.660 --> 01:38:56.580]   And it became a huge thing in and of its own right.
[01:38:56.580 --> 01:38:57.660]   I remember this very well.
[01:38:57.660 --> 01:39:00.140]   I was alive at the time.
[01:39:00.140 --> 01:39:01.140]   Good.
[01:39:01.140 --> 01:39:03.980]   So we had-- we said, OK, so how do we update this?
[01:39:03.980 --> 01:39:07.180]   Number one, users are the content creators.
[01:39:07.180 --> 01:39:09.340]   So instead of having the staff of a newspaper write,
[01:39:09.340 --> 01:39:11.140]   it will have our listeners write it,
[01:39:11.140 --> 01:39:12.940]   our NSFW listeners write it.
[01:39:12.940 --> 01:39:15.140]   Number two, the New York Times bestseller list
[01:39:15.140 --> 01:39:18.260]   are now lists like Amazon and iBooks,
[01:39:18.260 --> 01:39:20.620]   even though the New York Times bestsellers still exist.
[01:39:20.620 --> 01:39:21.180]   But for us--
[01:39:21.180 --> 01:39:21.900]   So what are they going to do?
[01:39:21.900 --> 01:39:22.780]   Check bookstores?
[01:39:22.780 --> 01:39:24.340]   Like people buy books at bookstores?
[01:39:24.340 --> 01:39:24.980]   Absolutely.
[01:39:24.980 --> 01:39:27.380]   And number three, that a secret isn't a secret anymore.
[01:39:27.380 --> 01:39:30.780]   I mean, they kept it a secret that Penelope Ash, their student
[01:39:30.780 --> 01:39:32.260]   name, was--
[01:39:32.260 --> 01:39:33.620]   They didn't tell anybody.
[01:39:33.620 --> 01:39:37.220]   Yeah, until they revealed it in this big talk show kind of thing.
[01:39:37.220 --> 01:39:39.460]   We decided we're just going to--
[01:39:39.460 --> 01:39:40.260]   secrets are public.
[01:39:40.260 --> 01:39:41.860]   We can yell and scream about this all we want,
[01:39:41.860 --> 01:39:44.660]   and nobody will really know because no one will really care.
[01:39:44.660 --> 01:39:47.780]   And so we eventually-- we released this on Monday.
[01:39:47.780 --> 01:39:49.580]   This is all user created.
[01:39:49.580 --> 01:39:51.860]   All of our users wrote all these chapters.
[01:39:51.860 --> 01:39:52.820]   We basically created--
[01:39:52.820 --> 01:39:53.340]   Wait a minute.
[01:39:53.340 --> 01:39:55.380]   You wrote-- did you write the first one?
[01:39:55.380 --> 01:39:56.140]   Because I have to--
[01:39:56.140 --> 01:39:57.340]   I may or may not have written the first one.
[01:39:57.340 --> 01:40:00.020]   I detect a little bit of your style in there.
[01:40:00.020 --> 01:40:02.220]   I may or may not have written the line--
[01:40:02.220 --> 01:40:03.180]   Alabaster Thighs.
[01:40:03.180 --> 01:40:07.060]   Accepting a friend request between Alabaster Thighs.
[01:40:07.060 --> 01:40:08.260]   So--
[01:40:08.260 --> 01:40:09.860]   Were you sober at the Times?
[01:40:09.860 --> 01:40:13.100]   Well, I'm telling you, Pulitzer Prize, I'm telling you.
[01:40:13.100 --> 01:40:15.380]   So basically, the experiment is--
[01:40:15.380 --> 01:40:18.180]   and now that it's a success, we can take this from--
[01:40:18.180 --> 01:40:20.220]   maybe the Booker Prize.
[01:40:20.220 --> 01:40:21.220]   Yes.
[01:40:21.220 --> 01:40:23.060]   For erotic fiction.
[01:40:23.060 --> 01:40:25.740]   We can now take it from the silly,
[01:40:25.740 --> 01:40:28.860]   oh, we ran a prank thing to the insufferable--
[01:40:28.860 --> 01:40:30.460]   this is why it's art explanation.
[01:40:30.460 --> 01:40:32.980]   You got articles there that the Telegraph wrote about it.
[01:40:32.980 --> 01:40:33.820]   Yeah.
[01:40:33.820 --> 01:40:35.900]   You're getting-- everybody's writing about this.
[01:40:35.900 --> 01:40:37.180]   This is a very interesting thing.
[01:40:37.180 --> 01:40:39.740]   Yeah, the Daily Dot wrote about it.
[01:40:39.740 --> 01:40:41.620]   So the money goes to what?
[01:40:41.620 --> 01:40:42.980]   OK, so here's the thing.
[01:40:42.980 --> 01:40:44.500]   We expected this.
[01:40:44.500 --> 01:40:45.660]   We've run a lot of these stupid things.
[01:40:45.660 --> 01:40:46.860]   It's starting to be a lot of money.
[01:40:46.860 --> 01:40:48.060]   It's my point.
[01:40:48.060 --> 01:40:48.900]   Yeah, no, absolutely.
[01:40:48.900 --> 01:40:51.340]   And so when people asked us initially, like, oh, well,
[01:40:51.340 --> 01:40:52.780]   what are you going to do with the money?
[01:40:52.780 --> 01:40:55.300]   What do you mean we're going to do with $500?
[01:40:55.300 --> 01:40:56.180]   We'll have a party.
[01:40:56.180 --> 01:40:58.700]   We're going to make some books for the people that wrote it,
[01:40:58.700 --> 01:41:01.380]   maybe get some t-shirts and throw a party for people
[01:41:01.380 --> 01:41:04.100]   that contributed and want to come.
[01:41:04.100 --> 01:41:05.620]   Now you're talking Kickstarter money.
[01:41:05.620 --> 01:41:09.100]   It has since become significantly more than $500.
[01:41:09.100 --> 01:41:13.420]   So on the NSFW show this week, we're going to talk about it.
[01:41:13.420 --> 01:41:14.740]   We're going to figure it out.
[01:41:14.740 --> 01:41:18.460]   It's been incredibly humbling and amazing
[01:41:18.460 --> 01:41:21.380]   that people wanted to get in on this silly thing.
[01:41:21.380 --> 01:41:24.380]   And basically, the idea was, what would happen if you made
[01:41:24.380 --> 01:41:27.820]   a erotic fiction novel in a post-50 Shades of Grey world
[01:41:27.820 --> 01:41:31.780]   that very specifically and stringently eliminated plot
[01:41:31.780 --> 01:41:36.140]   and character development and just added nothing but three
[01:41:36.140 --> 01:41:37.420]   scoops of sex?
[01:41:37.420 --> 01:41:39.260]   It's 31 pages.
[01:41:39.260 --> 01:41:39.940]   No.
[01:41:39.940 --> 01:41:40.420]   OK.
[01:41:40.420 --> 01:41:41.020]   That's a mistake.
[01:41:41.020 --> 01:41:41.420]   That's a mistake.
[01:41:41.420 --> 01:41:43.220]   There's an air on the Apple site.
[01:41:43.220 --> 01:41:47.140]   Believe me, you get plenty of excitement in this book.
[01:41:47.140 --> 01:41:50.100]   I was going to say, that's why I was really curious.
[01:41:50.100 --> 01:41:52.300]   9,000 sales with 31 pages documents.
[01:41:52.300 --> 01:41:54.100]   So I feel better knowing it's people of mine.
[01:41:54.100 --> 01:41:54.620]   Oh, no.
[01:41:54.620 --> 01:41:55.980]   It's 250 pages.
[01:41:55.980 --> 01:41:58.340]   And I will say this, we have a lot of--
[01:41:58.340 --> 01:41:59.140]   Sex.
[01:41:59.140 --> 01:41:59.860]   Oh, geez.
[01:41:59.860 --> 01:42:01.020]   It's nothing but sex.
[01:42:01.020 --> 01:42:05.540]   It is absolutely 100% sex, sex, sex, sex.
[01:42:05.540 --> 01:42:08.020]   Do the exclusion of everything else?
[01:42:08.020 --> 01:42:09.940]   Or is that a metaphor?
[01:42:09.940 --> 01:42:10.420]   Can I just--
[01:42:10.420 --> 01:42:11.380]   You know what's interesting here?
[01:42:11.380 --> 01:42:12.740]   Can I just say what's interesting here is?
[01:42:12.740 --> 01:42:14.500]   I've noticed-- I've just recently,
[01:42:14.500 --> 01:42:17.220]   because of these iBooks and reading of these things.
[01:42:17.220 --> 01:42:19.260]   I found out a friend of mine who had no idea
[01:42:19.260 --> 01:42:22.580]   read romance novels, had hundreds of them on the iBooks.
[01:42:22.580 --> 01:42:23.060]   Oh, yeah.
[01:42:23.060 --> 01:42:23.540]   You know what I mean?
[01:42:23.540 --> 01:42:25.100]   And this is something they don't want to read
[01:42:25.100 --> 01:42:26.900]   and public necessarily on a plane,
[01:42:26.900 --> 01:42:29.380]   but when they're on the iBooks or whatever,
[01:42:29.380 --> 01:42:30.540]   they're reading the kindles.
[01:42:30.540 --> 01:42:31.620]   They like to read them.
[01:42:31.620 --> 01:42:34.140]   So you'll see a lot more of this kind of--
[01:42:34.140 --> 01:42:35.540]   it just is a really interesting trend,
[01:42:35.540 --> 01:42:36.180]   because you can--
[01:42:36.180 --> 01:42:36.700]   Interesting.
[01:42:36.700 --> 01:42:38.140]   --read what you want to read.
[01:42:38.140 --> 01:42:41.500]   But I was shocked this person had so many romance novels.
[01:42:41.500 --> 01:42:43.900]   I had no idea this was an interest or whatever.
[01:42:43.900 --> 01:42:46.460]   But I'm like, you know, she heaves her breasts
[01:42:46.460 --> 01:42:47.900]   or whatever the names of those things are.
[01:42:47.900 --> 01:42:49.380]   There's--
[01:42:49.380 --> 01:42:50.020]   It's insane.
[01:42:50.020 --> 01:42:51.140]   It's really interesting.
[01:42:51.140 --> 01:42:52.820]   It's iBooks changes everything,
[01:42:52.820 --> 01:42:54.580]   because you can actually enjoy these.
[01:42:54.580 --> 01:42:57.300]   Well, what it's done for erotic fiction
[01:42:57.300 --> 01:42:59.700]   with the VCR did for porno, right?
[01:42:59.700 --> 01:43:00.200]   Right.
[01:43:00.200 --> 01:43:02.300]   It's made it so that you can take it home.
[01:43:02.300 --> 01:43:05.620]   There was a story about people watching porn on their iPads
[01:43:05.620 --> 01:43:06.380]   recently.
[01:43:06.380 --> 01:43:08.580]   You know, now people are bringing them into coffee shops
[01:43:08.580 --> 01:43:09.820]   or whatever.
[01:43:09.820 --> 01:43:10.660]   But this is different.
[01:43:10.660 --> 01:43:13.100]   This is reading, because it really does hide.
[01:43:13.100 --> 01:43:15.260]   You could be reading it in public, and people don't see what
[01:43:15.260 --> 01:43:16.060]   you're reading.
[01:43:16.060 --> 01:43:18.260]   The porn stuff is a little more problematic.
[01:43:18.260 --> 01:43:18.860]   No, I'm just saying.
[01:43:18.860 --> 01:43:21.820]   But the VCR used to be--
[01:43:21.820 --> 01:43:23.260]   again, I'm holding up to remember this.
[01:43:23.260 --> 01:43:25.820]   You had to go to a movie theater to watch porn.
[01:43:25.820 --> 01:43:26.740]   OK, Fred Willard.
[01:43:26.740 --> 01:43:30.620]   But even before the digital publishing break
[01:43:30.620 --> 01:43:33.100]   is in, you're still talking about romance novels.
[01:43:33.100 --> 01:43:35.980]   The statistics, something like every 30 seconds,
[01:43:35.980 --> 01:43:38.020]   somebody buys a no-book, romance novel.
[01:43:38.020 --> 01:43:38.500]   Yeah.
[01:43:38.500 --> 01:43:42.500]   This is just off the supermarket shelves and bookstores
[01:43:42.500 --> 01:43:42.780]   and stuff.
[01:43:42.780 --> 01:43:43.900]   I mean, some of the bookstores--
[01:43:43.900 --> 01:43:45.820]   Imagine eye books are going to be even bigger,
[01:43:45.820 --> 01:43:48.980]   because then people who sort of ferret them away.
[01:43:48.980 --> 01:43:51.660]   Because people-- this person was embarrassed to be reading them,
[01:43:51.660 --> 01:43:53.780]   but it wasn't because they were on-- it was really interesting
[01:43:53.780 --> 01:43:55.220]   that they have interest in it.
[01:43:55.220 --> 01:43:57.260]   And knew all the writers and super interesting.
[01:43:57.260 --> 01:44:01.780]   The romance writers of America, the industry's net revenue
[01:44:01.780 --> 01:44:06.860]   decreased from $10.27 billion in 2009 to $10.11 billion in 2010.
[01:44:06.860 --> 01:44:07.700]   But I mean, it's--
[01:44:07.700 --> 01:44:08.380]   It's going to go up.
[01:44:08.380 --> 01:44:09.020]   But the romance--
[01:44:09.020 --> 01:44:09.540]   They're cheap.
[01:44:09.540 --> 01:44:11.020]   They're less expensive.
[01:44:11.020 --> 01:44:11.980]   They don't make as much money.
[01:44:11.980 --> 01:44:14.940]   And really, that was the idea of the Diamond Club,
[01:44:14.940 --> 01:44:18.900]   was that once we kind of elevated into the top 10,
[01:44:18.900 --> 01:44:20.700]   would we be--
[01:44:20.700 --> 01:44:22.700]   please pardon the pun, sticky--
[01:44:22.700 --> 01:44:27.860]   and just absolutely be part of the reading list of people
[01:44:27.860 --> 01:44:29.740]   who just serially buy these books.
[01:44:29.740 --> 01:44:32.780]   And we've seen some backlash of people
[01:44:32.780 --> 01:44:35.340]   that are giving it one star reviews,
[01:44:35.340 --> 01:44:38.220]   that this is not what their kind of book is.
[01:44:38.220 --> 01:44:40.260]   They like more character development
[01:44:40.260 --> 01:44:42.300]   and plot in the romance novel.
[01:44:42.300 --> 01:44:44.580]   But compared to what we are selling,
[01:44:44.580 --> 01:44:47.100]   and compared to what books like 50 Shades of Grey
[01:44:47.100 --> 01:44:49.140]   get in one star reviews, we're really
[01:44:49.140 --> 01:44:52.340]   not all that abnormal for other low costs.
[01:44:52.340 --> 01:44:55.300]   I think it's significantly better written, to be honest with you,
[01:44:55.300 --> 01:44:56.900]   than most of the stuff I've read on.
[01:44:56.900 --> 01:44:58.580]   It is actually very funny.
[01:44:58.580 --> 01:45:02.020]   Like, our listeners are very, very, very funny.
[01:45:02.020 --> 01:45:03.500]   All I'm going to say is that there
[01:45:03.500 --> 01:45:08.460]   is a chapter that involves a veteran of the Iraq War who
[01:45:08.460 --> 01:45:10.620]   lost his leg that had me--
[01:45:10.620 --> 01:45:13.900]   I was on a flight from Washington, DC, back to SFO this week,
[01:45:13.900 --> 01:45:16.740]   that had me laughing so hard, I embarrassed myself
[01:45:16.740 --> 01:45:18.060]   in front of the entire plane.
[01:45:18.060 --> 01:45:22.580]   Somebody told me there is a character in that book
[01:45:22.580 --> 01:45:24.860]   with a name somewhat like mine.
[01:45:24.860 --> 01:45:26.580]   There is likely a character.
[01:45:26.580 --> 01:45:27.740]   OK, just check it.
[01:45:27.740 --> 01:45:29.980]   Your name has a lot of possibilities to leave.
[01:45:29.980 --> 01:45:31.540]   Oh, it does.
[01:45:31.540 --> 01:45:33.820]   Well, I know that there is, of course, the main character
[01:45:33.820 --> 01:45:37.060]   is named Breonna Young, and she has a Trist with somebody
[01:45:37.060 --> 01:45:40.420]   named Justine Brushwood.
[01:45:40.420 --> 01:45:43.420]   There's-- no, it's all littered with NSFW references.
[01:45:43.420 --> 01:45:46.060]   But it's been-- did you edit this in any way, or vet it,
[01:45:46.060 --> 01:45:46.380]   or you just--
[01:45:46.380 --> 01:45:47.100]   Speed Lord, no.
[01:45:47.100 --> 01:45:48.140]   You just threw it all in.
[01:45:48.140 --> 01:45:49.100]   So you haven't even read it.
[01:45:49.100 --> 01:45:50.380]   No, I'm going to have it.
[01:45:50.380 --> 01:45:51.340]   OK.
[01:45:51.340 --> 01:45:52.620]   And that was after it came out.
[01:45:52.620 --> 01:45:53.900]   So you don't even know what's happening.
[01:45:53.900 --> 01:45:57.460]   No, I shared an experience with the rest of America this week,
[01:45:57.460 --> 01:46:00.940]   and I got to read the Diamond Club for the first time.
[01:46:00.940 --> 01:46:04.540]   So from Mars Rover to Pawnee novels, fantastic.
[01:46:04.540 --> 01:46:05.940]   Oh, we cover the-- we cover the water, please.
[01:46:05.940 --> 01:46:07.380]   That's what technology is all about.
[01:46:07.380 --> 01:46:08.820]   We cover the water.
[01:46:08.820 --> 01:46:09.420]   Absolutely.
[01:46:09.420 --> 01:46:12.100]   But yeah, no, the one cool thing that
[01:46:12.100 --> 01:46:14.620]   is going to be interesting for anybody who's into e-publishing
[01:46:14.620 --> 01:46:16.140]   and wants to know more about this stuff
[01:46:16.140 --> 01:46:18.940]   is unlike a lot of authors or publishers.
[01:46:18.940 --> 01:46:21.900]   We have literally no reason to keep any of this information
[01:46:21.900 --> 01:46:22.500]   secret.
[01:46:22.500 --> 01:46:24.580]   We want to get a week's worth out because we
[01:46:24.580 --> 01:46:29.220]   think that's going to be the best data set to show what
[01:46:29.220 --> 01:46:32.940]   a hit e-book on the iBook store is.
[01:46:32.940 --> 01:46:36.740]   But on the next NSFW show, every red cent
[01:46:36.740 --> 01:46:37.980]   will be accounted for, every copy.
[01:46:37.980 --> 01:46:39.060]   Oh, who cares?
[01:46:39.060 --> 01:46:40.740]   99 cents, come on.
[01:46:40.740 --> 01:46:41.500]   Oh, no, no, no, no.
[01:46:41.500 --> 01:46:43.700]   I don't mean where it's going to go,
[01:46:43.700 --> 01:46:46.700]   but just what it's sold in what per day.
[01:46:46.700 --> 01:46:47.200]   Right.
[01:46:47.200 --> 01:46:50.020]   Just I think people who are interested in e-publishing,
[01:46:50.020 --> 01:46:51.900]   I think will like that data.
[01:46:51.900 --> 01:46:55.020]   And the charts we know this from podcasts on iTunes
[01:46:55.020 --> 01:46:55.660]   are ballistic.
[01:46:55.660 --> 01:46:58.660]   So they're very much about what happened most recently,
[01:46:58.660 --> 01:46:59.660]   as opposed to--
[01:46:59.660 --> 01:47:00.160]   Yeah.
[01:47:00.160 --> 01:47:02.060]   Like if, let's say, we just dropped it to number five
[01:47:02.060 --> 01:47:02.820]   today from number four.
[01:47:02.820 --> 01:47:04.340]   We were at number four all week.
[01:47:04.340 --> 01:47:06.740]   If everybody on Twitch went and bought it now,
[01:47:06.740 --> 01:47:08.660]   it would probably go back up to number four.
[01:47:08.660 --> 01:47:09.820]   Right.
[01:47:09.820 --> 01:47:10.660]   This is podcast.
[01:47:10.660 --> 01:47:12.420]   This is e-book, e-book.
[01:47:12.420 --> 01:47:13.260]   E-book only.
[01:47:13.260 --> 01:47:14.500]   There's no print of this.
[01:47:14.500 --> 01:47:14.940]   No.
[01:47:14.940 --> 01:47:15.500]   No, no, no.
[01:47:15.500 --> 01:47:19.580]   I think we might do something for the people that wrote it.
[01:47:19.580 --> 01:47:21.300]   We're probably going to do hard covers for them,
[01:47:21.300 --> 01:47:23.380]   just so as a thank you.
[01:47:23.380 --> 01:47:27.060]   And so they can have it and maybe we'll sell them or something.
[01:47:27.060 --> 01:47:27.740]   Yeah.
[01:47:27.740 --> 01:47:28.240]   I don't know.
[01:47:28.240 --> 01:47:29.660]   Or if there's any publishers out there,
[01:47:29.660 --> 01:47:31.580]   you want to pick up the print rights, the Diamond Club,
[01:47:31.580 --> 01:47:32.580]   Holler-Edgy Boy.
[01:47:32.580 --> 01:47:34.540]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:47:34.540 --> 01:47:38.060]   I actually know the guy who optioned 50 Shades of Grey,
[01:47:38.060 --> 01:47:40.460]   Dana Brunetti option, that for focus features.
[01:47:40.460 --> 01:47:44.060]   And Dana's a great friend of the--
[01:47:44.060 --> 01:47:46.060]   maybe he'd be interested in an option of the Diamond Club.
[01:47:46.060 --> 01:47:46.540]   Talk to me.
[01:47:46.540 --> 01:47:47.100]   I'll talk to him.
[01:47:47.100 --> 01:47:47.620]   Talk to me.
[01:47:47.620 --> 01:47:48.300]   Here we go.
[01:47:48.300 --> 01:47:50.260]   I'm sure you won't get what E.L. James got.
[01:47:50.260 --> 01:47:51.100]   No, no, no.
[01:47:51.100 --> 01:47:53.180]   That's fine.
[01:47:53.180 --> 01:47:56.180]   You can own Star Wars and Space Balls.
[01:47:56.180 --> 01:48:01.780]   So it's kind of apt, actually.
[01:48:01.780 --> 01:48:03.420]   All right, then.
[01:48:03.420 --> 01:48:05.220]   So Henry Blodgett, writing and business
[01:48:05.220 --> 01:48:06.500]   insider, Pure Linkbait.
[01:48:06.500 --> 01:48:09.260]   But I loved it.
[01:48:09.260 --> 01:48:10.980]   If the iPhone really looks like this,
[01:48:10.980 --> 01:48:13.660]   Apple may be screwed.
[01:48:13.660 --> 01:48:17.740]   His point is that it isn't much of a change.
[01:48:17.740 --> 01:48:20.100]   And that really hurt iPhone 4S sales.
[01:48:20.100 --> 01:48:23.380]   Yeah, the iPhone 4S was even less of a change.
[01:48:23.380 --> 01:48:25.700]   Yeah, this is a Pure Linkbait title.
[01:48:25.700 --> 01:48:28.140]   Except that one thing that has changed
[01:48:28.140 --> 01:48:30.300]   is you've got the Galaxy S3 Samsung's announced.
[01:48:30.300 --> 01:48:34.260]   It's going to have the Galaxy Note 2, an unbreakable 5.5
[01:48:34.260 --> 01:48:38.500]   inch screen available four days before the Apple announcement.
[01:48:38.500 --> 01:48:40.740]   I'll believe it's unbreakable after I use one for a month.
[01:48:40.740 --> 01:48:41.260]   I know.
[01:48:41.260 --> 01:48:42.620]   If anybody could break it, you will.
[01:48:42.620 --> 01:48:45.500]   I got to say, I mean, the Galaxy S3 is a gorgeous phone.
[01:48:45.500 --> 01:48:45.860]   I love it.
[01:48:45.860 --> 01:48:48.340]   But it is big.
[01:48:48.340 --> 01:48:49.020]   That's big?
[01:48:49.020 --> 01:48:50.020]   You think that's big?
[01:48:50.020 --> 01:48:51.620]   Well, I put phones in my pocket.
[01:48:51.620 --> 01:48:53.460]   The problem with the iPhone is small.
[01:48:53.460 --> 01:48:57.500]   I mean, I think that this is-- now, the new iPhone is bigger,
[01:48:57.500 --> 01:48:58.980]   but still not as big.
[01:48:58.980 --> 01:49:01.740]   The rumored new iPhone that everyone is reporting on.
[01:49:01.740 --> 01:49:02.860]   With the rumored new--
[01:49:02.860 --> 01:49:03.340]   Look at this big.
[01:49:03.340 --> 01:49:04.140]   The dock connectors.
[01:49:04.140 --> 01:49:04.820]   Does that feel big to you?
[01:49:04.820 --> 01:49:05.900]   Others, me the most about the iPhone.
[01:49:05.900 --> 01:49:06.860]   They're using the iPhone.
[01:49:06.860 --> 01:49:07.620]   I'm using the iPhone 4.
[01:49:07.620 --> 01:49:08.260]   What do you use that?
[01:49:08.260 --> 01:49:09.180]   Are you using a Windows phone?
[01:49:09.180 --> 01:49:10.460]   Of course, you are.
[01:49:10.460 --> 01:49:12.100]   Yeah, I'm using the only Windows phone
[01:49:12.100 --> 01:49:14.340]   that Verizon has for--
[01:49:14.340 --> 01:49:16.100]   Verizon, which is the worst--
[01:49:16.100 --> 01:49:17.100]   It's not a very good one.
[01:49:17.100 --> 01:49:17.100]   Yeah.
[01:49:17.100 --> 01:49:17.860]   We're in the world.
[01:49:17.860 --> 01:49:18.860]   Yeah.
[01:49:18.860 --> 01:49:19.820]   There we go.
[01:49:19.820 --> 01:49:22.140]   So you say my phone's big.
[01:49:22.140 --> 01:49:23.980]   I'd say your phone's tiny.
[01:49:23.980 --> 01:49:24.500]   Well, all right.
[01:49:24.500 --> 01:49:27.620]   We don't have to start name calling.
[01:49:27.620 --> 01:49:30.700]   I would rather have a 1280 by 800 screen.
[01:49:30.700 --> 01:49:32.900]   I would rather have--
[01:49:32.900 --> 01:49:33.900]   You know, all the--
[01:49:33.900 --> 01:49:34.780]   It just seems--
[01:49:34.780 --> 01:49:35.260]   But you're--
[01:49:35.260 --> 01:49:36.260]   And look how much thinner this is.
[01:49:36.260 --> 01:49:38.660]   You are the worst phone reviewer on the planet.
[01:49:38.660 --> 01:49:39.940]   I say this with love and affection,
[01:49:39.940 --> 01:49:42.180]   but you change phones every 15 minutes.
[01:49:42.180 --> 01:49:43.420]   That's so I can review them.
[01:49:43.420 --> 01:49:43.920]   Yes.
[01:49:43.920 --> 01:49:44.420]   I know, but I mean--
[01:49:44.420 --> 01:49:45.100]   And you love all of them.
[01:49:45.100 --> 01:49:46.900]   That's what makes me a good phone reviewer is actually I
[01:49:46.900 --> 01:49:48.900]   commit for one, two weeks.
[01:49:48.900 --> 01:49:50.580]   I'm like the bacon and breakfast.
[01:49:50.580 --> 01:49:51.180]   I'm committed.
[01:49:51.180 --> 01:49:53.060]   I'm not like some egg.
[01:49:53.060 --> 01:49:55.620]   I am committed.
[01:49:55.620 --> 01:49:57.860]   And so no, I've used this phone for months.
[01:49:57.860 --> 01:49:59.860]   Totally the chicken, not the pig.
[01:49:59.860 --> 01:50:00.820]   This is unusual.
[01:50:00.820 --> 01:50:01.460]   I should say that.
[01:50:01.460 --> 01:50:04.100]   Actually, that is the biggest testament for this phone,
[01:50:04.100 --> 01:50:06.100]   is that you have actually held on to it for months instead
[01:50:06.100 --> 01:50:07.420]   of being on your seventh phone.
[01:50:07.420 --> 01:50:08.380]   And I think the other thing that's
[01:50:08.380 --> 01:50:11.020]   changed since the last iPhone a year ago
[01:50:11.020 --> 01:50:14.860]   is the app ecosystem on Android is now roughly equivalent,
[01:50:14.860 --> 01:50:15.620]   wouldn't you say?
[01:50:15.620 --> 01:50:19.780]   The biggest issue with Android is you're still talking about
[01:50:19.780 --> 01:50:24.380]   90% of the number I saw a few weeks ago is 80% or 85%,
[01:50:24.380 --> 01:50:28.580]   90% of Android phones are still at like 2.1.
[01:50:28.580 --> 01:50:29.380]   Yeah.
[01:50:29.380 --> 01:50:29.860]   It's factful.
[01:50:29.860 --> 01:50:31.260]   All the ones are.
[01:50:31.260 --> 01:50:32.860]   But if you buy a new one, you'll have--
[01:50:32.860 --> 01:50:33.340]   Sure.
[01:50:33.340 --> 01:50:35.060]   But how many people are buying--
[01:50:35.060 --> 01:50:35.980]   I don't know.
[01:50:35.980 --> 01:50:37.620]   It's an interesting question about how many--
[01:50:37.620 --> 01:50:41.780]   100% of iPhone 3s are at the old iOS.
[01:50:41.780 --> 01:50:43.700]   What does that mean?
[01:50:43.700 --> 01:50:45.140]   Well, there's a higher--
[01:50:45.140 --> 01:50:47.780]   I think Henry likes to write those kind of headlines.
[01:50:47.780 --> 01:50:48.420]   I know it's blinking.
[01:50:48.420 --> 01:50:51.820]   What's interesting here is that these new Samsung--
[01:50:51.820 --> 01:50:53.340]   especially the Samsung phones--
[01:50:53.340 --> 01:50:54.220]   are really good.
[01:50:54.220 --> 01:50:54.740]   Yes.
[01:50:54.740 --> 01:50:57.180]   And they're not as glitchy and they're not as wonky.
[01:50:57.180 --> 01:50:59.140]   I mean, a lot of the problem with early Android phones
[01:50:59.140 --> 01:51:00.420]   is they were incredibly wonky.
[01:51:00.420 --> 01:51:02.380]   They crash all the time.
[01:51:02.380 --> 01:51:04.020]   And so I think these are--
[01:51:04.020 --> 01:51:06.580]   I mean, the challenge rapples that they don't change a lot.
[01:51:06.580 --> 01:51:08.900]   I mean, for the first time I saw, I think,
[01:51:08.900 --> 01:51:10.020]   one of the Samsung phones.
[01:51:10.020 --> 01:51:13.060]   And I'm an Apple user for years and years
[01:51:13.060 --> 01:51:14.580]   in terms of the iPhone and stuff like that.
[01:51:14.580 --> 01:51:15.740]   I just happen to like it better.
[01:51:15.740 --> 01:51:17.700]   But for the first time, I was a little bit jealous.
[01:51:17.700 --> 01:51:18.780]   And it never happens.
[01:51:18.780 --> 01:51:20.500]   I have to say, it was the first time I'm like,
[01:51:20.500 --> 01:51:21.780]   oh, that's kind of cool.
[01:51:21.780 --> 01:51:22.500]   What was on it?
[01:51:22.500 --> 01:51:25.460]   And I doubt I will switch.
[01:51:25.460 --> 01:51:27.660]   But it definitely-- they'll have to do something special
[01:51:27.660 --> 01:51:30.620]   in this new version for me to buy it.
[01:51:30.620 --> 01:51:33.900]   And it definitely was the first time I thought, well,
[01:51:33.900 --> 01:51:37.420]   they somehow have hidden the wonkiness of Android
[01:51:37.420 --> 01:51:38.180]   in a good way.
[01:51:38.180 --> 01:51:40.580]   So that's really the point, is that they really
[01:51:40.580 --> 01:51:43.180]   have to up the game this time rather than just
[01:51:43.180 --> 01:51:45.460]   make small changes.
[01:51:45.460 --> 01:51:46.460]   I think probably a lot of people--
[01:51:46.460 --> 01:51:47.500]   And do you think they will?
[01:51:47.500 --> 01:51:49.060]   I mean, they're notorious.
[01:51:49.060 --> 01:51:51.180]   Apples and the tourists are surprising, everybody.
[01:51:51.180 --> 01:51:51.940]   Yeah.
[01:51:51.940 --> 01:51:55.620]   But I mean, isn't it what is happening inside the iPhone
[01:51:55.620 --> 01:51:57.180]   that is kind of the edge there?
[01:51:57.180 --> 01:52:00.860]   That even if they have a minimalist and familiar design,
[01:52:00.860 --> 01:52:04.380]   that that means less than what is in their ecosystem
[01:52:04.380 --> 01:52:06.980]   with the App Store and what the iPhone is going to work?
[01:52:06.980 --> 01:52:08.860]   I think the iPhone is looking a little older.
[01:52:08.860 --> 01:52:09.260]   That's all.
[01:52:09.260 --> 01:52:11.420]   It just is looking a little less slick than it was when
[01:52:11.420 --> 01:52:12.140]   it first came out.
[01:52:12.140 --> 01:52:15.860]   And I think really, because phones are so interchangeable now,
[01:52:15.860 --> 01:52:18.260]   as Leo is probably the most use of them.
[01:52:18.260 --> 01:52:20.860]   But I think people want something fresh.
[01:52:20.860 --> 01:52:23.780]   And so fresh doesn't mean a totally different thing,
[01:52:23.780 --> 01:52:25.820]   but something that's not maybe a little thinner.
[01:52:25.820 --> 01:52:29.180]   I would prefer a thinner phone, maybe a bigger screen.
[01:52:29.180 --> 01:52:29.860]   I think it's kind of--
[01:52:29.860 --> 01:52:32.460]   LTE, which I guess the iPhone will have.
[01:52:32.460 --> 01:52:33.420]   Yeah.
[01:52:33.420 --> 01:52:34.020]   Bigger screen.
[01:52:34.020 --> 01:52:36.460]   It has to have-- this screen is not--
[01:52:36.460 --> 01:52:37.820]   It's too small.
[01:52:37.820 --> 01:52:38.540]   It's too small.
[01:52:38.540 --> 01:52:41.140]   And I think that that's probably-- and probably thinner.
[01:52:41.140 --> 01:52:44.540]   And no matter what's inside, I think people
[01:52:44.540 --> 01:52:47.260]   want slightly different form factor, just not tons.
[01:52:47.260 --> 01:52:49.380]   But you want something fresh.
[01:52:49.380 --> 01:52:51.860]   It hasn't been freshened up since it was--
[01:52:51.860 --> 01:52:52.620]   since a long time.
[01:52:52.620 --> 01:52:53.980]   Well, maybe we do agree with Henry,
[01:52:53.980 --> 01:52:55.300]   because the new iPhone--
[01:52:55.300 --> 01:52:56.460]   Well, that's screwed.
[01:52:56.460 --> 01:52:56.860]   And I think--
[01:52:56.860 --> 01:52:58.220]   Very similar to the old one.
[01:52:58.220 --> 01:53:00.900]   And in fact, has one feature that I think a lot of people
[01:53:00.900 --> 01:53:01.660]   are going to be upset about.
[01:53:01.660 --> 01:53:04.060]   It changes the age-old 30-pin connector
[01:53:04.060 --> 01:53:05.140]   for an 19-pin connector.
[01:53:05.140 --> 01:53:06.860]   That's, certainly, again, all reverse.
[01:53:06.860 --> 01:53:08.580]   And that's what it kind of comes down to.
[01:53:08.580 --> 01:53:11.140]   It puts the headphone connector on the bottom of the phone
[01:53:11.140 --> 01:53:13.740]   next to the smaller dot connector, which may or may not
[01:53:13.740 --> 01:53:15.900]   work collectively with all of the existing hardware
[01:53:15.900 --> 01:53:18.900]   with or without an adapter.
[01:53:18.900 --> 01:53:20.220]   I'd be curious.
[01:53:20.220 --> 01:53:22.700]   At this point, does Apple think the design is iconic,
[01:53:22.700 --> 01:53:24.980]   and they're afraid to change it?
[01:53:24.980 --> 01:53:26.460]   No, I don't think-- no, not at all.
[01:53:26.460 --> 01:53:27.780]   I was just like--
[01:53:27.780 --> 01:53:29.220]   The thing about the thing--
[01:53:29.220 --> 01:53:31.180]   I was just irritated by my new MacBook.
[01:53:31.180 --> 01:53:33.660]   I had to change out everything, which is irritating.
[01:53:33.660 --> 01:53:36.140]   But I don't think that's going to stop people from buying this.
[01:53:36.140 --> 01:53:39.180]   It's a question of there's a lot of very fresh, exciting phones
[01:53:39.180 --> 01:53:41.580]   from using the Android system.
[01:53:41.580 --> 01:53:44.860]   And so that's-- and they'll be from Windows.
[01:53:44.860 --> 01:53:47.700]   And so the question is not from RIM, obviously,
[01:53:47.700 --> 01:53:50.500]   this Christmas again.
[01:53:50.500 --> 01:53:53.780]   But it's a question of whether the regular users
[01:53:53.780 --> 01:53:54.580]   want something fresh.
[01:53:54.580 --> 01:53:56.460]   I know I do.
[01:53:56.460 --> 01:54:00.660]   And I'm a very loyal iPhone user.
[01:54:00.660 --> 01:54:01.660]   Well, I'll say this.
[01:54:01.660 --> 01:54:05.020]   I mean, my buddy Steve Kowback works for Silicon Alley Insider.
[01:54:05.020 --> 01:54:06.660]   And he was fighting with Henry.
[01:54:06.660 --> 01:54:08.260]   He was fighting with Henry over this.
[01:54:08.260 --> 01:54:08.740]   Oh, was he?
[01:54:08.740 --> 01:54:10.100]   Steve said, yeah, if you scroll down,
[01:54:10.100 --> 01:54:14.140]   you'll say my colleague Steve says, I'm nuts.
[01:54:14.140 --> 01:54:15.500]   More link bait, by the way.
[01:54:15.500 --> 01:54:15.780]   Yeah.
[01:54:15.780 --> 01:54:16.660]   Oh, no, definitely.
[01:54:16.660 --> 01:54:17.140]   Exactly.
[01:54:17.140 --> 01:54:19.620]   Do link to another thing inside of Silicon Alley Insider.
[01:54:19.620 --> 01:54:21.580]   But no, between these headlines and slideshows,
[01:54:21.580 --> 01:54:25.900]   it comprises of 25% of my conversation with him.
[01:54:25.900 --> 01:54:30.940]   Microsoft has announced a new mouse that's just really interesting.
[01:54:30.940 --> 01:54:35.180]   What do you think about the wedge touch mouse there, Ed Bot?
[01:54:35.180 --> 01:54:37.100]   That-- I like it.
[01:54:37.100 --> 01:54:38.620]   It's interesting.
[01:54:38.620 --> 01:54:41.500]   And that's one of the things in terms of hardware design
[01:54:41.500 --> 01:54:44.740]   that they've done really, really well through the years.
[01:54:44.740 --> 01:54:49.660]   I've got a couple of the arc touch mouses here.
[01:54:49.660 --> 01:54:51.220]   And they're really neat.
[01:54:51.220 --> 01:54:55.380]   And so they have a good history with multi-touch technology.
[01:54:55.380 --> 01:54:58.420]   But I'm actually more interested in that keyboard,
[01:54:58.420 --> 01:55:00.180]   especially for Windows 8.
[01:55:00.180 --> 01:55:01.700]   Because I know a lot of the complaints
[01:55:01.700 --> 01:55:03.460]   that people have had about Windows 8
[01:55:03.460 --> 01:55:09.220]   is that the interface with a mouse and a keyboard is somewhat
[01:55:09.220 --> 01:55:09.660]   awkward.
[01:55:09.660 --> 01:55:14.500]   And even when you learn it, it just doesn't sink in.
[01:55:14.500 --> 01:55:18.940]   But this one will have dedicated keys on it
[01:55:18.940 --> 01:55:22.460]   that are mapped to the Windows 8 interface.
[01:55:22.460 --> 01:55:26.380]   And so instead of having to move your mouse up into a corner
[01:55:26.380 --> 01:55:30.460]   and make the menu appear, you'll just
[01:55:30.460 --> 01:55:32.420]   be able to hit one of those dedicated keys
[01:55:32.420 --> 01:55:36.860]   and either go to the start screen or share something or search.
[01:55:36.860 --> 01:55:38.820]   And so that, I think, is something
[01:55:38.820 --> 01:55:42.180]   that might take care of some of the objections
[01:55:42.180 --> 01:55:47.860]   that people have to the Windows 8 interface.
[01:55:47.860 --> 01:55:50.500]   Microsoft has been doing great keyboards and mice
[01:55:50.500 --> 01:55:55.780]   for a long time, almost unheralded.
[01:55:55.780 --> 01:55:58.420]   So this has a regular Windows key on it
[01:55:58.420 --> 01:55:59.380]   with the new Windows logo.
[01:55:59.380 --> 01:56:00.700]   But there's another keyboard I think
[01:56:00.700 --> 01:56:04.500]   that has a key for the charms, for instance, which
[01:56:04.500 --> 01:56:05.340]   would be very nice.
[01:56:05.340 --> 01:56:09.100]   It's kind of hard to navigate to the charms.
[01:56:09.100 --> 01:56:10.060]   Right.
[01:56:10.060 --> 01:56:12.540]   I thought-- and I suggested this at one point--
[01:56:12.540 --> 01:56:16.860]   that instead of right now it's Windows key plus C
[01:56:16.860 --> 01:56:18.980]   is how you make the change menu appear.
[01:56:18.980 --> 01:56:21.460]   And I thought-- and I still think
[01:56:21.460 --> 01:56:24.980]   that tapping the Windows key should just make that menu appear.
[01:56:24.980 --> 01:56:27.020]   And then if you tap it again, it'll take you to the start
[01:56:27.020 --> 01:56:27.860]   screen.
[01:56:27.860 --> 01:56:28.900]   That's a nice idea.
[01:56:28.900 --> 01:56:31.100]   And in fact, I'm hoping if anyone's listening
[01:56:31.100 --> 01:56:32.420]   and you're out there a developer,
[01:56:32.420 --> 01:56:35.820]   I'd like that utility to be available
[01:56:35.820 --> 01:56:41.420]   so that I could remap those keys on the Windows 8 interface.
[01:56:41.420 --> 01:56:45.420]   And collectively, together we will make a small fortune.
[01:56:45.420 --> 01:56:48.180]   We do know we do have a date now for Windows 8.
[01:56:48.180 --> 01:56:51.140]   It'll be October-- what is it, 26?
[01:56:51.140 --> 01:56:52.100]   26.
[01:56:52.100 --> 01:56:56.420]   Day after the new iPad, many goes on sale.
[01:56:56.420 --> 01:56:57.980]   Judging by what you said earlier.
[01:56:57.980 --> 01:56:59.580]   If that's correct-- and the interesting thing
[01:56:59.580 --> 01:57:02.180]   is that Microsoft's always said that the Surface--
[01:57:02.180 --> 01:57:05.260]   Windows RT version of Surface will ship the same day.
[01:57:05.260 --> 01:57:05.780]   Same day.
[01:57:05.780 --> 01:57:10.340]   And then the-- and oddly, which-- that surprised me
[01:57:10.340 --> 01:57:14.940]   that the more conventional Windows 8 Pro version, which
[01:57:14.940 --> 01:57:19.100]   is kind of a-- it's a PC, the tablet form factor,
[01:57:19.100 --> 01:57:21.900]   and you already have those and the hinge touch keyboard
[01:57:21.900 --> 01:57:22.460]   and such.
[01:57:22.460 --> 01:57:25.540]   But that will take another 90 days to come about.
[01:57:25.540 --> 01:57:29.500]   And that was surprising to me.
[01:57:29.500 --> 01:57:32.220]   I wonder if that's to protect OEMs, maybe,
[01:57:32.220 --> 01:57:34.300]   because Microsoft's maybe--
[01:57:34.300 --> 01:57:35.220]   No?
[01:57:35.220 --> 01:57:35.700]   No.
[01:57:35.700 --> 01:57:42.700]   I think it has probably more to do with power management.
[01:57:42.700 --> 01:57:46.460]   You know, there's probably some custom circuitry
[01:57:46.460 --> 01:57:47.460]   that's going in there.
[01:57:47.460 --> 01:57:52.620]   They have a lot that they need to do with the x86, x64 versions
[01:57:52.620 --> 01:57:55.060]   of Windows 8 and hardware to get them
[01:57:55.060 --> 01:57:58.580]   so that you can truly get all day battery life with them.
[01:57:58.580 --> 01:58:00.500]   And that's the real challenge.
[01:58:00.500 --> 01:58:02.980]   You know, putting it into a--
[01:58:02.980 --> 01:58:05.380]   into that form factor isn't difficult.
[01:58:05.380 --> 01:58:09.180]   I've got a Samsung Series 7 here that's perfectly--
[01:58:09.180 --> 01:58:11.620]   makes a perfectly good tablet.
[01:58:11.620 --> 01:58:15.220]   But it heats up and the fan comes on.
[01:58:15.220 --> 01:58:17.460]   And the battery life is five hours
[01:58:17.460 --> 01:58:18.980]   when you really need eight hours.
[01:58:18.980 --> 01:58:22.700]   And so that's where the challenge is,
[01:58:22.700 --> 01:58:24.260]   where they're working with Intel and some
[01:58:24.260 --> 01:58:27.260]   of the chip makers to get that circuitry
[01:58:27.260 --> 01:58:30.980]   so that the Windows 8 Pro version will have the performance
[01:58:30.980 --> 01:58:32.660]   that they need.
[01:58:32.660 --> 01:58:33.900]   So we're going to take a break.
[01:58:33.900 --> 01:58:35.900]   Patrick, you're not seeing the Olympics.
[01:58:35.900 --> 01:58:37.860]   Anybody else watching the Olympics?
[01:58:37.860 --> 01:58:38.260]   Yeah.
[01:58:38.260 --> 01:58:38.900]   A little bit.
[01:58:38.900 --> 01:58:43.620]   I tried to catch the 100 meter dash on the iPad stream
[01:58:43.620 --> 01:58:45.140]   to the Apple TV before I came up here.
[01:58:45.140 --> 01:58:48.540]   But I couldn't-- their iPad app is just--
[01:58:48.540 --> 01:58:49.620]   It's pretty awful.
[01:58:49.620 --> 01:58:52.020]   Jank 10BC fail is the hashtag.
[01:58:52.020 --> 01:58:56.460]   And it's an interesting nexus between Twitter and NBC.
[01:58:56.460 --> 01:58:57.860]   We'll talk about that in just a little bit.
[01:58:57.860 --> 01:59:01.580]   But first, let's talk about audible.com.
[01:59:01.580 --> 01:59:03.500]   Audible, of course, are our online bookstore.
[01:59:03.500 --> 01:59:06.740]   We're such big fans of it.
[01:59:06.740 --> 01:59:13.660]   Again, if the Diamond Club ever needs somebody to do a audio--
[01:59:13.660 --> 01:59:14.900]   that would ruin my career.
[01:59:14.900 --> 01:59:17.740]   I mean, do you think that you can carry the Brianna Young
[01:59:17.740 --> 01:59:18.180]   character?
[01:59:18.180 --> 01:59:19.380]   Can you do the lady boys?
[01:59:19.380 --> 01:59:20.380]   No, no, no, no.
[01:59:20.380 --> 01:59:23.540]   She should talk like Patricia Harkins Bradley.
[01:59:23.540 --> 01:59:24.380]   Wait a minute.
[01:59:24.380 --> 01:59:25.540]   Let me just try.
[01:59:25.540 --> 01:59:26.540]   No, let's do that.
[01:59:26.540 --> 01:59:28.060]   You know, we have a staffer, Eric Kesseldahl,
[01:59:28.060 --> 01:59:29.980]   who has a fantastic radio voice.
[01:59:29.980 --> 01:59:32.620]   No, maybe Eric could do it with me.
[01:59:32.620 --> 01:59:33.660]   Yeah, but two of you.
[01:59:33.660 --> 01:59:35.500]   I was instantly lightheaded.
[01:59:35.500 --> 01:59:36.500]   My heart pounded.
[01:59:36.500 --> 01:59:36.980]   Oh, right.
[01:59:36.980 --> 01:59:40.620]   But I had to at least make an effort to keep it together.
[01:59:40.620 --> 01:59:41.140]   Oh.
[01:59:41.140 --> 01:59:43.420]   All right, I'm leaving.
[01:59:43.420 --> 01:59:44.780]   All right, all right, I'll stop.
[01:59:44.780 --> 01:59:46.340]   You know, I have to meet my kids soon.
[01:59:46.340 --> 01:59:47.100]   Do you want to take off?
[01:59:47.100 --> 01:59:47.860]   You can take off.
[01:59:47.860 --> 01:59:48.540]   We're almost done.
[01:59:48.540 --> 01:59:50.580]   Unless you want to talk about the Olympics and Twitter?
[01:59:50.580 --> 01:59:51.420]   Yes, sure.
[01:59:51.420 --> 01:59:52.020]   Absolutely.
[01:59:52.020 --> 01:59:54.220]   All right, hold on just a sec.
[01:59:54.220 --> 01:59:56.460]   But first, a word about audible.com.
[01:59:56.460 --> 01:59:57.140]   And this will be quick.
[01:59:57.140 --> 01:59:57.660]   This is easy.
[01:59:57.660 --> 01:59:58.340]   This is painless.
[01:59:58.340 --> 01:59:59.740]   You know what I'm talking about?
[01:59:59.740 --> 02:00:04.060]   The best place to get audio books, 100,000 titles, fiction,
[02:00:04.060 --> 02:00:05.380]   nonfiction.
[02:00:05.380 --> 02:00:06.940]   You know, we're all busy these days.
[02:00:06.940 --> 02:00:10.180]   Who has time to read?
[02:00:10.180 --> 02:00:13.460]   And yet reading is to me, it was one of my great joys in life.
[02:00:13.460 --> 02:00:14.580]   That's when I found audible.
[02:00:14.580 --> 02:00:17.740]   And I found it literally 10, 11 years ago now.
[02:00:17.740 --> 02:00:21.140]   It was it just changed my life because suddenly, you know,
[02:00:21.140 --> 02:00:24.380]   that time I spent in the car on the commute, the time I spent
[02:00:24.380 --> 02:00:26.620]   at the gym, the time I even spent cleaning house and walking
[02:00:26.620 --> 02:00:29.740]   the dog could now be part of my reading time.
[02:00:29.740 --> 02:00:31.460]   And I just have to say, I'm so happy.
[02:00:31.460 --> 02:00:35.180]   My new read and I actually I hear this is an excellent audio
[02:00:35.180 --> 02:00:38.460]   book and I will be reading this because Wednesday, Daniel Suarez
[02:00:38.460 --> 02:00:40.060]   is going to be on triangulation.
[02:00:40.060 --> 02:00:41.100]   We're going to interview him.
[02:00:41.100 --> 02:00:43.700]   He's the guy who wrote the amazing demon and freedom
[02:00:43.700 --> 02:00:45.460]   TM, which we're gripping.
[02:00:45.460 --> 02:00:46.900]   And I listened to them on audible.
[02:00:46.900 --> 02:00:49.860]   Kill decision is new and just came out is, of course,
[02:00:49.860 --> 02:00:50.940]   on audible.
[02:00:50.940 --> 02:00:52.900]   And I hear a must listen.
[02:00:52.900 --> 02:00:55.660]   So this I'm going to tell you how you can get this and maybe
[02:00:55.660 --> 02:00:58.740]   get get even two for free.
[02:00:58.740 --> 02:01:02.140]   I'm going to get you two not one, but two books at audible.com.
[02:01:02.140 --> 02:01:02.500]   Here's the deal.
[02:01:02.500 --> 02:01:04.660]   Go to audible.com/twit2.
[02:01:04.660 --> 02:01:06.820]   You'll be signing up for the platinum account.
[02:01:06.820 --> 02:01:07.460]   That's the one I use.
[02:01:07.460 --> 02:01:08.340]   That's two books a month.
[02:01:08.340 --> 02:01:09.900]   I think that's just about right.
[02:01:09.900 --> 02:01:12.100]   If you're if you're a heavy listener, it's perfect.
[02:01:12.100 --> 02:01:14.260]   Your first month's free, your first two credits are free.
[02:01:14.260 --> 02:01:17.380]   And you can apply them to any of the books in the 100,000
[02:01:17.380 --> 02:01:18.820]   strong audible bookstore.
[02:01:18.820 --> 02:01:19.900]   But this would be a great one.
[02:01:19.900 --> 02:01:24.500]   Kill decision from Daniel Suarez or his first book, Demon.
[02:01:24.500 --> 02:01:27.100]   If you had one more credit, you could do all three.
[02:01:27.100 --> 02:01:28.140]   But next month.
[02:01:28.140 --> 02:01:28.980]   Yeah, next month.
[02:01:28.980 --> 02:01:30.260]   You can't quit any time.
[02:01:30.260 --> 02:01:32.220]   The books are yours to keep you pay nothing if you don't want
[02:01:32.220 --> 02:01:32.820]   to.
[02:01:32.820 --> 02:01:34.140]   But I think you're going to want to.
[02:01:34.140 --> 02:01:38.820]   This is just to me, any time you spend in the car,
[02:01:38.820 --> 02:01:41.700]   in the plane traveling, it's just such a relief
[02:01:41.700 --> 02:01:42.300]   to have audible.
[02:01:42.300 --> 02:01:44.220]   In fact, for me, it's--
[02:01:44.220 --> 02:01:45.100]   it's a security blanket.
[02:01:45.100 --> 02:01:47.060]   I don't travel anywhere without audible.
[02:01:47.060 --> 02:01:49.500]   Audible.com/twit2--
[02:01:49.500 --> 02:01:51.420]   yes, they do have 50 shades.
[02:01:51.420 --> 02:01:53.060]   Of course, that's what I'm saying.
[02:01:53.060 --> 02:01:53.700]   They've gotten it.
[02:01:53.700 --> 02:01:55.500]   And it's the number one download.
[02:01:55.500 --> 02:01:56.580]   I mean, maybe.
[02:01:56.580 --> 02:01:57.660]   I don't know.
[02:01:57.660 --> 02:01:59.140]   Until the Diamond Club.
[02:01:59.140 --> 02:02:00.100]   I'll talk to Patty.
[02:02:00.100 --> 02:02:01.100]   I'll see what Patty--
[02:02:01.100 --> 02:02:02.060]   Patty could read it.
[02:02:02.060 --> 02:02:02.740]   She could read it.
[02:02:02.740 --> 02:02:03.900]   She'd be awesome.
[02:02:03.900 --> 02:02:04.580]   Yeah.
[02:02:04.580 --> 02:02:06.540]   No, I'll tell-- I was on that flight
[02:02:06.540 --> 02:02:09.300]   that I read the Diamond Club on.
[02:02:09.300 --> 02:02:13.500]   Part of it was because I got to the end of "Dark Force
[02:02:13.500 --> 02:02:15.500]   Rising" of the Star Wars--
[02:02:15.500 --> 02:02:16.940]   Oh, you recommended that last time.
[02:02:16.940 --> 02:02:39.040]   --the "
[02:02:39.040 --> 02:02:45.880]   Lewis-- that's a great book.
[02:02:45.880 --> 02:02:46.880]   Fantastic.
[02:02:46.880 --> 02:02:46.880]   I know.
[02:02:46.880 --> 02:02:49.880]   I know, but it has so much perteness to today.
[02:02:49.880 --> 02:02:50.880]   Oh, man.
[02:02:50.880 --> 02:02:51.880]   It just is a lot.
[02:02:51.880 --> 02:02:52.880]   A lot of what's going on.
[02:02:52.880 --> 02:02:53.880]   Michael Lewis is untouchable.
[02:02:53.880 --> 02:02:54.880]   You know what I would do?
[02:02:54.880 --> 02:02:57.880]   I would read the first one, "The Liars Poker," which--
[02:02:57.880 --> 02:02:58.880]   Yeah.
[02:02:58.880 --> 02:02:59.880]   I've read it many times over it again.
[02:02:59.880 --> 02:03:00.880]   Oh, such a wonderful book.
[02:03:00.880 --> 02:03:02.880]   And he, in fact, refers to it at the beginning of the big short,
[02:03:02.880 --> 02:03:06.320]   saying, you know, I wrote "Lier's Poker" to change Wall Street,
[02:03:06.320 --> 02:03:07.840]   so it would never happen again.
[02:03:07.840 --> 02:03:08.840]   And it's worse.
[02:03:08.840 --> 02:03:09.840]   Just a lot of the stock in the picture.
[02:03:09.840 --> 02:03:12.040]   That would be-- and he's the guy who wrote "Moneyball," which
[02:03:12.040 --> 02:03:13.040]   was a huge hit.
[02:03:13.040 --> 02:03:14.040]   One side.
[02:03:14.040 --> 02:03:15.240]   That's a big thing.
[02:03:15.240 --> 02:03:17.720]   There's no alabaster thighs in it, though.
[02:03:17.720 --> 02:03:18.400]   No.
[02:03:18.400 --> 02:03:20.120]   Oh, unless you think people rolling around--
[02:03:20.120 --> 02:03:21.440]   No, take a note, Mikey.
[02:03:21.440 --> 02:03:23.240]   People rolling around in a barrel of money.
[02:03:23.240 --> 02:03:24.800]   That's pretty sexy.
[02:03:24.800 --> 02:03:26.600]   No, it's people looking over 10K.
[02:03:26.600 --> 02:03:27.440]   It's pretty much.
[02:03:27.440 --> 02:03:30.600]   The big short by Michael Lewis, and of course, you know,
[02:03:30.600 --> 02:03:33.560]   I'm sure they have his other book as well.
[02:03:33.560 --> 02:03:34.560]   Let me just check.
[02:03:34.560 --> 02:03:35.040]   Liars Poker.
[02:03:35.040 --> 02:03:35.800]   Liars Poker.
[02:03:35.800 --> 02:03:37.800]   You should read one after the other.
[02:03:37.800 --> 02:03:38.640]   Yeah, they do.
[02:03:38.640 --> 02:03:39.640]   Both fantastic.
[02:03:39.640 --> 02:03:40.640]   Read Liars Poker.
[02:03:40.640 --> 02:03:42.400]   He's working on a really interesting book about Obama.
[02:03:42.400 --> 02:03:44.600]   He's been embedded in the Obama administration,
[02:03:44.600 --> 02:03:45.680]   so it should be interesting.
[02:03:45.680 --> 02:03:47.600]   Really, one of the best reporters out there,
[02:03:47.600 --> 02:03:49.960]   great financial writer, really gets through it.
[02:03:49.960 --> 02:03:52.800]   And he was-- Liars Poker, he wrote because he was working--
[02:03:52.800 --> 02:03:54.320]   Yeah.
[02:03:54.320 --> 02:03:55.400]   Was it Milliken, or--
[02:03:55.400 --> 02:03:56.640]   I don't know if he was working at Milliken's company?
[02:03:56.640 --> 02:03:58.600]   No, he was at--
[02:03:58.600 --> 02:04:00.240]   like Cudier-- that's a law firm.
[02:04:00.240 --> 02:04:01.000]   A Solomon Brothers.
[02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:02.160]   Solomon Brothers, that's right.
[02:04:02.160 --> 02:04:04.400]   So he was right like in the middle.
[02:04:04.400 --> 02:04:05.440]   That would be two good books.
[02:04:05.440 --> 02:04:07.200]   All right, if you don't want fiction, nonfiction.
[02:04:07.200 --> 02:04:09.640]   Liars Poker and The Big Short.
[02:04:09.640 --> 02:04:10.160]   Yeah.
[02:04:10.160 --> 02:04:13.160]   And now they used to only have Moneyball, a bridge.
[02:04:13.160 --> 02:04:16.120]   Now they have Moneyball on a bridge, which Moneyball is
[02:04:16.120 --> 02:04:17.120]   fantastic.
[02:04:17.120 --> 02:04:17.640]   You see?
[02:04:17.640 --> 02:04:18.440]   And it's the problem.
[02:04:18.440 --> 02:04:20.000]   You go to Audible and you can't stop.
[02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:20.880]   It's like the candy.
[02:04:20.880 --> 02:04:22.200]   You've got to eat more.
[02:04:22.200 --> 02:04:24.400]   Every day, every month when it's like--
[02:04:24.400 --> 02:04:25.840]   I look forward to my renewal.
[02:04:25.840 --> 02:04:27.200]   New Audible credit stay.
[02:04:27.200 --> 02:04:30.360]   Yippee, papa.
[02:04:30.360 --> 02:04:31.880]   Audible.com/twit2.
[02:04:31.880 --> 02:04:33.560]   Two books waiting for you.
[02:04:33.560 --> 02:04:36.160]   Absolutely free.
[02:04:36.160 --> 02:04:38.880]   So what do you-- actually, I'd be curious what you think,
[02:04:38.880 --> 02:04:42.040]   Cara Swisher, about the-- what's your take on this Twitter
[02:04:42.040 --> 02:04:46.760]   issue, a journalist in England.
[02:04:46.760 --> 02:04:48.120]   Is it LA working for an English kid?
[02:04:48.120 --> 02:04:49.120]   I said they borked.
[02:04:49.120 --> 02:04:49.720]   I said Twitter.
[02:04:49.720 --> 02:04:51.440]   I got a lot of pushback on the web
[02:04:51.440 --> 02:04:52.720]   because I said they borked--
[02:04:52.720 --> 02:04:56.000]   Twitter borked on this one because it was a very public email.
[02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:57.520]   This guy-- it wasn't his private email.
[02:04:57.520 --> 02:05:00.800]   Guy Adams is a writer for-- is it The Guardian?
[02:05:00.800 --> 02:05:01.400]   Yeah.
[02:05:01.400 --> 02:05:01.880]   And he--
[02:05:01.880 --> 02:05:02.760]   I thought it was fine.
[02:05:02.760 --> 02:05:04.160]   I thought he-- what he did was fine.
[02:05:04.160 --> 02:05:06.040]   I guess it was against their terms of service.
[02:05:06.040 --> 02:05:06.800]   No, it wasn't.
[02:05:06.800 --> 02:05:08.440]   And this is-- and this is very interesting.
[02:05:08.440 --> 02:05:10.480]   It was absolutely not.
[02:05:10.480 --> 02:05:11.320]   So here's the deal.
[02:05:11.320 --> 02:05:15.960]   So Guy Adams was-- as many of us are-- annoyed at NBC
[02:05:15.960 --> 02:05:17.400]   and how it was handling particularly
[02:05:17.400 --> 02:05:23.760]   the opening ceremonies-- published the business email
[02:05:23.760 --> 02:05:27.000]   address of an NBC executive, an address
[02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:28.480]   that he says was easily discernible.
[02:05:28.480 --> 02:05:31.440]   He also quotes in his letter to Twitter
[02:05:31.440 --> 02:05:33.480]   the terms of service that say, if what
[02:05:33.480 --> 02:05:35.800]   you're publishing is already on the internet,
[02:05:35.800 --> 02:05:37.040]   you're off the hook.
[02:05:37.040 --> 02:05:39.320]   That's why it wasn't a violation of the terms of service.
[02:05:39.320 --> 02:05:39.600]   Right.
[02:05:39.600 --> 02:05:42.280]   What's interesting is that NBC sent in a complaint
[02:05:42.280 --> 02:05:45.440]   and then it automatically-- it does that on YouTube too,
[02:05:45.440 --> 02:05:47.760]   if you have-- there's a question over your videos.
[02:05:47.760 --> 02:05:50.160]   So I think it was-- I was told by some of the Twitter
[02:05:50.160 --> 02:05:51.560]   it was very automated initially.
[02:05:51.560 --> 02:05:55.080]   But I think even they think it was a mistake to take him down.
[02:05:55.080 --> 02:05:55.280]   Yeah.
[02:05:55.280 --> 02:05:55.800]   Well, Twitter--
[02:05:55.800 --> 02:05:58.040]   The understanding is that it went the other way around.
[02:05:58.040 --> 02:05:58.640]   Exactly.
[02:05:58.640 --> 02:06:02.560]   That Twitter is the one who notified NBC.
[02:06:02.560 --> 02:06:08.200]   And in fact, the blog post and apology from Twitter
[02:06:08.200 --> 02:06:11.240]   was written by Twitter's general counsel, which
[02:06:11.240 --> 02:06:16.600]   suggests that they realize that they stepped in a big pile
[02:06:16.600 --> 02:06:18.480]   of legal mess.
[02:06:18.480 --> 02:06:22.440]   Twitter's because what they've done
[02:06:22.440 --> 02:06:25.600]   is the same thing as a publisher.
[02:06:25.600 --> 02:06:31.360]   If you start paying attention to the content of things
[02:06:31.360 --> 02:06:33.880]   that people are posting on your service,
[02:06:33.880 --> 02:06:36.400]   then you start becoming responsible for other things
[02:06:36.400 --> 02:06:37.560]   that people post.
[02:06:37.560 --> 02:06:38.760]   You lose your safe harbor.
[02:06:38.760 --> 02:06:40.280]   Which is going to be tough on Twitter.
[02:06:40.280 --> 02:06:42.520]   We're going to say-- I mean, the stuff that goes on there
[02:06:42.520 --> 02:06:44.920]   is much more liable, I would assume,
[02:06:44.920 --> 02:06:46.560]   some of the things that are set back and forth.
[02:06:46.560 --> 02:06:46.960]   But--
[02:06:46.960 --> 02:06:47.760]   Just as Matt.
[02:06:47.760 --> 02:06:49.120]   Sorry for getting the right things wrong.
[02:06:49.120 --> 02:06:50.160]   Again, it was away last week.
[02:06:50.160 --> 02:06:51.520]   But I think it borked.
[02:06:51.520 --> 02:06:53.520]   I mean, that's pretty much how I looked at it.
[02:06:53.520 --> 02:06:57.880]   And I think that they understand that.
[02:06:57.880 --> 02:06:59.520]   But it was perfectly fine what he did.
[02:06:59.520 --> 02:07:02.840]   He was expressing an opinion about really bad coverage.
[02:07:02.840 --> 02:07:05.000]   Well, and some of the concern was that NBC is in--
[02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:06.560]   is kind of a hand in pocket with Twitter.
[02:07:06.560 --> 02:07:07.200]   Well, yeah.
[02:07:07.200 --> 02:07:08.200]   And that's what it's funny.
[02:07:08.200 --> 02:07:11.520]   When you get down to the second to last paragraph on Twitter's
[02:07:11.520 --> 02:07:16.160]   blog, it's like, the team working closely with NBC
[02:07:16.160 --> 02:07:18.600]   around our Olympics partnership with NBC
[02:07:18.600 --> 02:07:20.580]   did proactively identify a tweet that
[02:07:20.580 --> 02:07:21.800]   was in violation of the Twitter rules
[02:07:21.800 --> 02:07:24.320]   and encouraged NBC to file a support ticket
[02:07:24.320 --> 02:07:27.000]   with our trust and safety team to report the violation.
[02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:28.640]   And I can hear this conversation.
[02:07:28.640 --> 02:07:31.120]   And it's like, this guy's hammering us.
[02:07:31.120 --> 02:07:32.480]   What are you going to do about him?
[02:07:32.480 --> 02:07:34.280]   It's like, well, you could do this.
[02:07:34.280 --> 02:07:38.640]   And then once this is filed, once the support ticket
[02:07:38.640 --> 02:07:40.200]   with trust and safety has been filed,
[02:07:40.200 --> 02:07:42.640]   trust and safety is obligated to basically hammer
[02:07:42.640 --> 02:07:43.760]   the account with a stick.
[02:07:43.760 --> 02:07:44.760]   Yeah.
[02:07:44.760 --> 02:07:45.680]   And--
[02:07:45.680 --> 02:07:47.200]   I mean, I think they weren't understanding
[02:07:47.200 --> 02:07:49.480]   the difference between editorial and their business
[02:07:49.480 --> 02:07:52.200]   relationships, which I think is hard for a company like that.
[02:07:52.200 --> 02:07:53.640]   I mean, they are an editor.
[02:07:53.640 --> 02:07:55.480]   They are a publisher.
[02:07:55.480 --> 02:07:57.240]   And they also are a business.
[02:07:57.240 --> 02:08:00.440]   And so I think that's not very clear at that company
[02:08:00.440 --> 02:08:01.920]   that they are, that there are two.
[02:08:01.920 --> 02:08:04.760]   Possibly there should be a wall of some sort
[02:08:04.760 --> 02:08:07.800]   between what's on Twitter and what the business relationships
[02:08:07.800 --> 02:08:08.880]   are.
[02:08:08.880 --> 02:08:11.720]   So that'll be an interesting question for them going forward.
[02:08:11.720 --> 02:08:13.680]   But I mean, the guy had every right to do that,
[02:08:13.680 --> 02:08:14.440]   every single right.
[02:08:14.440 --> 02:08:16.720]   Well, I mean, the question was the email, right?
[02:08:16.720 --> 02:08:18.400]   It wasn't necessarily the news saying that everything
[02:08:18.400 --> 02:08:19.480]   stank on ice.
[02:08:19.480 --> 02:08:22.320]   It was that he gave away this dude's email
[02:08:22.320 --> 02:08:24.600]   that I'm sure people at NBC thought
[02:08:24.600 --> 02:08:27.960]   was less cool than he defined it as.
[02:08:27.960 --> 02:08:30.480]   That it was easy to find on the internet.
[02:08:30.480 --> 02:08:32.880]   They consider that more private than they probably
[02:08:32.880 --> 02:08:35.760]   realize it is publicly available.
[02:08:35.760 --> 02:08:39.960]   And so that's why they came at it in like a we were injured.
[02:08:39.960 --> 02:08:40.480]   Kind of so--
[02:08:40.480 --> 02:08:42.080]   Oh, don't you think that was just the excuse?
[02:08:42.080 --> 02:08:42.560]   The guy was doing some--
[02:08:42.560 --> 02:08:43.560]   Exactly.
[02:08:43.560 --> 02:08:43.560]   Exactly.
[02:08:43.560 --> 02:08:45.120]   I mean, I was involved in that.
[02:08:45.120 --> 02:08:46.640]   Because I was happened to be in Israel,
[02:08:46.640 --> 02:08:47.880]   and I got to watch the whole thing.
[02:08:47.880 --> 02:08:50.440]   And I was tweeting, like, what the hell's going on with this
[02:08:50.440 --> 02:08:52.480]   Baltimore attacking the Mary Poppins thing.
[02:08:52.480 --> 02:08:53.920]   I was like, it's huge.
[02:08:53.920 --> 02:08:56.320]   So everyone was like, how are you watching it, Kara?
[02:08:56.320 --> 02:08:57.720]   And I said, I'm watching it in Israel.
[02:08:57.720 --> 02:08:58.320]   You know what I mean?
[02:08:58.320 --> 02:09:00.240]   And so it was--
[02:09:00.240 --> 02:09:01.360]   And then I started insulting.
[02:09:01.360 --> 02:09:03.480]   And then all these British people started insulting me.
[02:09:03.480 --> 02:09:03.800]   And it went--
[02:09:03.800 --> 02:09:04.800]   Wow.
[02:09:04.800 --> 02:09:06.160]   But it was--
[02:09:06.160 --> 02:09:08.160]   I was like, oh, it's British rumor.
[02:09:08.160 --> 02:09:08.720]   You don't get it.
[02:09:08.720 --> 02:09:09.400]   I'm like, fine.
[02:09:09.400 --> 02:09:10.400]   It's not good.
[02:09:10.400 --> 02:09:12.280]   But anyway, so--
[02:09:12.280 --> 02:09:15.000]   But it was interesting because the--
[02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:17.520]   I think then I started to notice all the Americans were
[02:09:17.520 --> 02:09:19.480]   like, why are you watching it?
[02:09:19.480 --> 02:09:22.480]   So I think that it was justifiable in terms of what he was
[02:09:22.480 --> 02:09:22.840]   saying.
[02:09:22.840 --> 02:09:23.920]   He definitely was--
[02:09:23.920 --> 02:09:26.880]   I was reading him and thought he was the most effective Twitter
[02:09:26.880 --> 02:09:31.640]   on this issue in terms of jamming at home that NBC had
[02:09:31.640 --> 02:09:32.160]   screwed up.
[02:09:32.160 --> 02:09:34.760]   And I thought that might have been that he was so effective
[02:09:34.760 --> 02:09:37.960]   that they decided to slow him down a little bit.
[02:09:37.960 --> 02:09:39.280]   Yeah, I guess I just--
[02:09:39.280 --> 02:09:41.040]   Twitter's all in an interesting position, too,
[02:09:41.040 --> 02:09:44.960]   because they are really moving into Hollywood.
[02:09:44.960 --> 02:09:48.040]   They're making a television show.
[02:09:48.040 --> 02:09:52.720]   There is kind of this interesting--
[02:09:52.720 --> 02:09:54.920]   I've been following a guy named Dalton Caldwell.
[02:09:54.920 --> 02:09:58.120]   He started I-Meeam and Pick, please.
[02:09:58.120 --> 02:10:00.680]   And he started a new response to--
[02:10:00.680 --> 02:10:02.400]   he feels-- not a people--
[02:10:02.400 --> 02:10:04.200]   not especially third-party developers
[02:10:04.200 --> 02:10:06.760]   feel like Twitter's turned their back on the people who
[02:10:06.760 --> 02:10:09.120]   created Twitter, the third-party developers, the apps.
[02:10:09.120 --> 02:10:11.840]   They want people to go to the website because they
[02:10:11.840 --> 02:10:13.280]   want to make the money on the ads.
[02:10:13.280 --> 02:10:15.000]   They become an ad company.
[02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:16.800]   And there are a number of people who say that was a kind
[02:10:16.800 --> 02:10:17.480]   of a mistake.
[02:10:17.480 --> 02:10:20.480]   Apparently, it was an internal battle at Twitter some years
[02:10:20.480 --> 02:10:21.480]   ago.
[02:10:21.480 --> 02:10:22.920]   Yes.
[02:10:22.920 --> 02:10:24.320]   It was like what's going on at Yahoo.
[02:10:24.320 --> 02:10:26.880]   Should we be a platform or should we be an ad company?
[02:10:26.880 --> 02:10:28.960]   But Twitter, this has gone on before with developers.
[02:10:28.960 --> 02:10:29.640]   That's a problem.
[02:10:29.640 --> 02:10:32.440]   People are really eating off their ecosystem a lot.
[02:10:32.440 --> 02:10:34.320]   There's a lot of businesses that have been formed off
[02:10:34.320 --> 02:10:35.880]   the back of what Twitter's doing.
[02:10:35.880 --> 02:10:38.120]   And now they've been tried at different times
[02:10:38.120 --> 02:10:38.960]   to put a stop to it.
[02:10:38.960 --> 02:10:40.520]   Now they're really putting a stop to it.
[02:10:40.520 --> 02:10:42.280]   And so they've made the decision.
[02:10:42.280 --> 02:10:44.840]   I mean, I don't think there's a debate any longer.
[02:10:44.840 --> 02:10:47.920]   They're not allowing people to suck all this data out
[02:10:47.920 --> 02:10:49.280]   of their system.
[02:10:49.280 --> 02:10:51.480]   And the question is, how important
[02:10:51.480 --> 02:10:54.440]   is this developer ecosystem to them or not?
[02:10:54.440 --> 02:10:57.800]   And it's definitely a fantastic story.
[02:10:57.800 --> 02:11:00.400]   And we had published some of the--
[02:11:00.400 --> 02:11:02.760]   well, Dalton was also fighting with Facebook, which is interesting.
[02:11:02.760 --> 02:11:05.000]   He wrote a very-- well, he actually was scathing.
[02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:09.480]   He said Facebook essentially invited us in and threatened us
[02:11:09.480 --> 02:11:12.600]   and said, hey, we could either hire--
[02:11:12.600 --> 02:11:14.320]   do an acquire and buy your company.
[02:11:14.320 --> 02:11:16.720]   So somebody got there, be a shame if something happened to it.
[02:11:16.720 --> 02:11:18.040]   Yeah.
[02:11:18.040 --> 02:11:19.280]   And he was shocked.
[02:11:19.280 --> 02:11:21.360]   And he wrote a post about it.
[02:11:21.360 --> 02:11:22.160]   I didn't know.
[02:11:22.160 --> 02:11:24.840]   He's shocked by threatened large companies threatening small ones.
[02:11:24.840 --> 02:11:25.840]   That's wow.
[02:11:25.840 --> 02:11:29.920]   I think he wrote an open letter to Mark Zuckerberg.
[02:11:29.920 --> 02:11:32.520]   You can read it at DaltonCalledwell.com,
[02:11:32.520 --> 02:11:34.720]   telling the whole story about being threatened.
[02:11:34.720 --> 02:11:38.120]   And he thought he was going to be demonstrating an iOS app
[02:11:38.120 --> 02:11:39.520]   and service app.net.
[02:11:39.520 --> 02:11:43.120]   And it turned out he said it'd be, yeah, we could either crush you
[02:11:43.120 --> 02:11:43.960]   or we could buy you.
[02:11:43.960 --> 02:11:45.360]   What would you like?
[02:11:45.360 --> 02:11:47.200]   There was a line of-- Bill Gates used to use a lot.
[02:11:47.200 --> 02:11:50.080]   It was the first line of my first book on AOL.
[02:11:50.080 --> 02:11:53.360]   I mean, it's classic when big companies--
[02:11:53.360 --> 02:11:56.720]   So you say it's-- he's naive to think that it's--
[02:11:56.720 --> 02:11:58.560]   No, it's a very good letter.
[02:11:58.560 --> 02:12:00.880]   But I mean, this is what these companies--
[02:12:00.880 --> 02:12:02.720]   when they want something, they want something.
[02:12:02.720 --> 02:12:05.600]   And in this case, I guess it's not quite like Microsoft
[02:12:05.600 --> 02:12:07.640]   because it's not a monopoly at this point.
[02:12:07.640 --> 02:12:08.640]   But--
[02:12:08.640 --> 02:12:09.120]   You know.
[02:12:09.120 --> 02:12:11.080]   Well, one of the things Dalton's done-- and I've joined it--
[02:12:11.080 --> 02:12:12.000]   actually gave us some money.
[02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:13.880]   He's trying to create a paid--
[02:12:13.880 --> 02:12:17.000]   not ad-based, but paid Twitter-like service
[02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:18.680]   with an open API.
[02:12:18.680 --> 02:12:21.360]   And he's asking people at join.app.net.
[02:12:21.360 --> 02:12:24.240]   He's doing kind of a fake Kickstarter.
[02:12:24.240 --> 02:12:25.400]   He says, I don't actually need the money.
[02:12:25.400 --> 02:12:28.600]   I just want to make-- I want to see if people are involved
[02:12:28.600 --> 02:12:30.280]   enough to make this worthwhile.
[02:12:30.280 --> 02:12:33.520]   So he's now pivoting app.net into a Twitter or Facebook
[02:12:33.520 --> 02:12:34.240]   or both competitor.
[02:12:34.240 --> 02:12:35.240]   Twitter.
[02:12:35.240 --> 02:12:37.080]   But it's going to be open.
[02:12:37.080 --> 02:12:38.400]   It's actually very interesting.
[02:12:38.400 --> 02:12:39.600]   You know, this has been done before.
[02:12:39.600 --> 02:12:40.280]   I've been prodromo.
[02:12:40.280 --> 02:12:42.840]   We've interviewed him, tried to do us with a status.net.
[02:12:42.840 --> 02:12:44.800]   And in identical, it was originally identical.
[02:12:44.800 --> 02:12:46.160]   He's a sharp entrepreneur.
[02:12:46.160 --> 02:12:47.680]   He hasn't had success all the time,
[02:12:47.680 --> 02:12:49.320]   but he's definitely a sharp guy.
[02:12:49.320 --> 02:12:50.520]   Dalton.
[02:12:50.520 --> 02:12:51.020]   Yeah.
[02:12:51.020 --> 02:12:52.720]   He's a task entrepreneur, so--
[02:12:52.720 --> 02:12:53.600]   I'm very impressed.
[02:12:53.600 --> 02:12:54.560]   And I think he's right.
[02:12:54.560 --> 02:12:56.200]   And this is something I've been saying for a long time.
[02:12:56.200 --> 02:12:58.160]   And I think that Twitter is more--
[02:12:58.160 --> 02:13:02.080]   should be more of a public utility than an ad service.
[02:13:02.080 --> 02:13:04.240]   And there's an opportunity for somebody
[02:13:04.240 --> 02:13:06.120]   to create that utility.
[02:13:06.120 --> 02:13:08.040]   And this is interesting.
[02:13:08.040 --> 02:13:11.880]   Well, the question is ease of joining and getting the cloud.
[02:13:11.880 --> 02:13:13.000]   Well, now you have to pay for it.
[02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:14.960]   So he says, we don't have to worry about spam.
[02:13:14.960 --> 02:13:16.400]   You don't have to worry about who's in there,
[02:13:16.400 --> 02:13:17.680]   because it costs you money.
[02:13:17.680 --> 02:13:19.320]   Now, they don't know what eligible cost.
[02:13:19.320 --> 02:13:23.800]   Is that solving a problem that we don't--
[02:13:23.800 --> 02:13:26.960]   Well, if he's promising that he's not going to--
[02:13:26.960 --> 02:13:28.760]   I mean, the classic problem with Facebook
[02:13:28.760 --> 02:13:29.960]   is where is my information going?
[02:13:29.960 --> 02:13:31.240]   Why do they keep confusing this?
[02:13:31.240 --> 02:13:32.760]   Why do they make privacy complicated?
[02:13:32.760 --> 02:13:35.400]   Why do I feel dirty every time I go there?
[02:13:35.400 --> 02:13:36.760]   Because I feel like all this information
[02:13:36.760 --> 02:13:39.080]   of my life would get sucked out.
[02:13:39.080 --> 02:13:40.880]   If the idea is that we're not going to have ads,
[02:13:40.880 --> 02:13:42.040]   and we're not going to date a mine,
[02:13:42.040 --> 02:13:43.360]   and we're going to keep things--
[02:13:43.360 --> 02:13:44.880]   we're basically going to give you--
[02:13:44.880 --> 02:13:46.920]   for everybody who thinks they're actually going to Facebook
[02:13:46.920 --> 02:13:48.440]   to show up and hang out with their friends,
[02:13:48.440 --> 02:13:50.320]   we're going to give you an environment where you can go
[02:13:50.320 --> 02:13:52.280]   to Facebook and show up and hang out with their friends.
[02:13:52.280 --> 02:13:54.240]   Because it's interesting watching some people who are
[02:13:54.240 --> 02:13:58.280]   extraordinarily savvy about entrepreneurship and business.
[02:13:58.280 --> 02:14:00.360]   And the big things we don't talk about,
[02:14:00.360 --> 02:14:02.800]   which is that the big money is mining the information
[02:14:02.800 --> 02:14:05.160]   on the backside, that if they're promising that,
[02:14:05.160 --> 02:14:07.640]   it makes it kind of really compelling.
[02:14:07.640 --> 02:14:10.000]   There's great saying that came from Metafilter.
[02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:13.120]   If you're not paying for it, you're the product.
[02:14:13.120 --> 02:14:15.640]   And so Dalton's idea is, well, let's pay for it.
[02:14:15.640 --> 02:14:17.120]   And then we don't have to worry.
[02:14:17.120 --> 02:14:18.360]   Anyway, I think it's a good idea.
[02:14:18.360 --> 02:14:18.880]   I support.
[02:14:18.880 --> 02:14:19.360]   I get my hundred bucks.
[02:14:19.360 --> 02:14:22.200]   I guess my only question is, will it have enough people
[02:14:22.200 --> 02:14:25.120]   that we will get out of Twitter?
[02:14:25.120 --> 02:14:26.120]   Of course, that's a huge problem.
[02:14:26.120 --> 02:14:30.120]   And how many Twitter clones have I joined?
[02:14:30.120 --> 02:14:32.120]   I mean, that's a story history.
[02:14:32.120 --> 02:14:37.120]   I want to see the Rocky montage of Leo joining Twitter clones.
[02:14:37.120 --> 02:14:38.120]   Every one of them.
[02:14:38.120 --> 02:14:40.120]   I find Twitter enormously useful.
[02:14:40.120 --> 02:14:41.120]   I do too.
[02:14:41.120 --> 02:14:44.120]   And every day, a billion times a day, I'm on Twitter.
[02:14:44.120 --> 02:14:45.120]   I love Twitter.
[02:14:45.120 --> 02:14:47.120]   And I love using it, and it is incredibly useful.
[02:14:47.120 --> 02:14:51.120]   And I think it is a public utility, and it needs to be treated
[02:14:51.120 --> 02:14:52.120]   as such as a post.
[02:14:52.120 --> 02:14:54.120]   We just also love Plurk.
[02:14:54.120 --> 02:14:55.120]   I like Plurk and Jakku.
[02:14:55.120 --> 02:14:56.120]   Thank you.
[02:14:56.120 --> 02:14:58.120]   I was going to say there was a shutter in the forest down
[02:14:58.120 --> 02:15:00.120]   in San Francisco with disturbance in the forest.
[02:15:00.120 --> 02:15:01.120]   They don't like me anyway.
[02:15:01.120 --> 02:15:02.120]   I don't care.
[02:15:02.120 --> 02:15:03.120]   Hey, let's see what's coming up.
[02:15:03.120 --> 02:15:06.120]   I want to let you go, Keras, which are because I know you've got
[02:15:06.120 --> 02:15:07.120]   to go get the kids.
[02:15:07.120 --> 02:15:08.120]   Thank you so much for being here.
[02:15:08.120 --> 02:15:09.120]   We really appreciate it.
[02:15:09.120 --> 02:15:11.120]   Keras, it all things D.
[02:15:11.120 --> 02:15:12.120]   We'll have you back soon.
[02:15:12.120 --> 02:15:14.120]   We're going to go share some data with iTunes right now.
[02:15:14.120 --> 02:15:17.120]   Go share some data and go buy Diamond Club because you'll love it.
[02:15:17.120 --> 02:15:19.120]   I am already done.
[02:15:19.120 --> 02:15:22.120]   All the gay cruises are reading it.
[02:15:22.120 --> 02:15:23.120]   Huge of gay cruises.
[02:15:23.120 --> 02:15:25.120]   You and me together, honey.
[02:15:25.120 --> 02:15:26.120]   We'll pass tells.
[02:15:26.120 --> 02:15:27.120]   It'll be fantastic.
[02:15:27.120 --> 02:15:28.120]   I can't wait.
[02:15:28.120 --> 02:15:29.120]   Take care, Kera.
[02:15:29.120 --> 02:15:31.120]   Let's take a look at what's coming up in the week ahead.
[02:15:31.120 --> 02:15:34.120]   Our great Tom Merritt of Tech News today has a look, Tom.
[02:15:34.120 --> 02:15:35.120]   Hey, thanks, Leo.
[02:15:35.120 --> 02:15:37.120]   Here's a look at some of the things we'll be keeping an eye on
[02:15:37.120 --> 02:15:38.120]   in the week ahead.
[02:15:38.120 --> 02:15:41.120]   Of course, coming up tonight, Sunday, 1031 PM Pacific, the Mars
[02:15:41.120 --> 02:15:45.120]   Curiosity Lander will arrive one way or another on the surface of
[02:15:45.120 --> 02:15:46.120]   Mars.
[02:15:46.120 --> 02:15:49.120]   We're doing live special coverage of that starting at 10 PM Pacific
[02:15:49.120 --> 02:15:50.120]   right here on Twit.
[02:15:50.120 --> 02:15:53.120]   But if you're watching this later, that will be in the Twit Live
[02:15:53.120 --> 02:15:55.120]   special feed as well.
[02:15:55.120 --> 02:15:58.120]   Wednesday, August 8th, the T-Mobile MyTouch and MyTouch Cure
[02:15:58.120 --> 02:15:59.120]   are coming for 50 bucks.
[02:15:59.120 --> 02:16:02.120]   Also T-Mobile will get in the Samsung Galaxy Note for $250.
[02:16:02.120 --> 02:16:05.120]   And the Usenix Security Symptom.
[02:16:05.120 --> 02:16:08.120]   And the Usenix Security Symposium kicks off August 8th and
[02:16:08.120 --> 02:16:09.120]   runs through the 10th.
[02:16:09.120 --> 02:16:13.120]   Thursday, August 9th, Rims 4G LTE tablet comes.
[02:16:13.120 --> 02:16:18.120]   And Saturday, August 11th, Chevron WP7 unlocked Windows phones
[02:16:18.120 --> 02:16:19.120]   will relock.
[02:16:19.120 --> 02:16:21.120]   Users get a free app hub.
[02:16:21.120 --> 02:16:23.120]   That's your last day of the unlock.
[02:16:23.120 --> 02:16:26.120]   That and of course, the Samsung Apple trial and lots of other
[02:16:26.120 --> 02:16:29.120]   stuff will be keeping an eye out in the week ahead.
[02:16:29.120 --> 02:16:30.120]   Back to you, Leo.
[02:16:30.120 --> 02:16:33.120]   Great show Monday through Friday, 10 AM Pacific, 1 PM Eastern
[02:16:33.120 --> 02:16:34.120]   time.
[02:16:34.120 --> 02:16:38.120]   That's 1,700 U-T-C-T and T-techno's today with Sarah.
[02:16:38.120 --> 02:16:41.120]   Lane, I, as actor, and of course, Tom Merritt.
[02:16:41.120 --> 02:16:42.120]   Jason Hell?
[02:16:42.120 --> 02:16:43.120]   And Jason Hell.
[02:16:43.120 --> 02:16:44.120]   I almost said, "Who's that?"
[02:16:44.120 --> 02:16:46.120]   But now I remember he's the tall guy.
[02:16:46.120 --> 02:16:47.120]   Yes.
[02:16:47.120 --> 02:16:48.120]   I see him around the building.
[02:16:48.120 --> 02:16:50.120]   Ow.
[02:16:50.120 --> 02:16:51.120]   Okay.
[02:16:51.120 --> 02:16:52.120]   Love you, Jay.
[02:16:52.120 --> 02:16:54.120]   Yeah, it's going to be fun.
[02:16:54.120 --> 02:16:55.120]   Tune in tonight for that.
[02:16:55.120 --> 02:16:56.120]   Are you excited about that, Ed?
[02:16:56.120 --> 02:16:59.120]   Do you like space or into that stuff?
[02:16:59.120 --> 02:17:04.120]   I remember the moon landing like it was yesterday and I've been
[02:17:04.120 --> 02:17:05.120]   a big fan.
[02:17:05.120 --> 02:17:10.120]   In fact, I remember the challenger blowing up and that was,
[02:17:10.120 --> 02:17:15.120]   and so the highs and then the lows and this is hopefully
[02:17:15.120 --> 02:17:16.120]   another high.
[02:17:16.120 --> 02:17:17.120]   Yep.
[02:17:17.120 --> 02:17:18.120]   I remember getting up.
[02:17:18.120 --> 02:17:20.120]   I definitely want to watch this.
[02:17:20.120 --> 02:17:23.120]   I was about 13 years old when Neil Armstrong took that first
[02:17:23.120 --> 02:17:26.120]   step on the moon and that's an age where that influences you
[02:17:26.120 --> 02:17:27.120]   for life.
[02:17:27.120 --> 02:17:30.120]   And like you and I very much remember watching the challenger
[02:17:30.120 --> 02:17:31.120]   live.
[02:17:31.120 --> 02:17:34.120]   I was actually writing, I was writing in my living room,
[02:17:34.120 --> 02:17:35.120]   writing Mac software.
[02:17:35.120 --> 02:17:38.120]   I was homesick that day from work.
[02:17:38.120 --> 02:17:39.120]   I was home on the couch.
[02:17:39.120 --> 02:17:43.120]   I had the flu and I felt horrible and I turned on the TV and
[02:17:43.120 --> 02:17:48.120]   that just made horrible times, you know, two orders of magnitude.
[02:17:48.120 --> 02:17:50.120]   You could believe what I was seeing.
[02:17:50.120 --> 02:17:51.120]   Yeah.
[02:17:51.120 --> 02:17:52.120]   It's like that can't have happened.
[02:17:52.120 --> 02:17:53.120]   Oh.
[02:17:53.120 --> 02:17:56.120]   So this is, but there have been, in the space program,
[02:17:56.120 --> 02:18:01.120]   there have been so many more really uplifting, noble,
[02:18:01.120 --> 02:18:05.120]   wonderful moments and I think this is going to be one of them,
[02:18:05.120 --> 02:18:08.120]   especially given, you know, the sort of abandonment that we've had
[02:18:08.120 --> 02:18:13.120]   of this, of the manned space program that this is something to
[02:18:13.120 --> 02:18:18.120]   at least see, you know, the possibility of something we've
[02:18:18.120 --> 02:18:19.120]   never seen before.
[02:18:19.120 --> 02:18:20.120]   I agree.
[02:18:20.120 --> 02:18:21.120]   It's very exciting.
[02:18:21.120 --> 02:18:23.120]   I'll tell you, it's based to me, it's on a role.
[02:18:23.120 --> 02:18:25.120]   Yeah, I was, I'm a huge SpaceX fan.
[02:18:25.120 --> 02:18:27.120]   I actually drove up excited.
[02:18:27.120 --> 02:18:28.120]   Did you?
[02:18:28.120 --> 02:18:32.120]   Yeah, I saw, I saw the Dragon capsule that talked with the ISS
[02:18:32.120 --> 02:18:33.120]   launch from Canaveral.
[02:18:33.120 --> 02:18:34.120]   Cool.
[02:18:34.120 --> 02:18:36.120]   I, I'm so thrilled.
[02:18:36.120 --> 02:18:40.120]   It's just such a great time to care about space and I think the
[02:18:40.120 --> 02:18:44.120]   reason why we've cared less about it is because there hasn't been a
[02:18:44.120 --> 02:18:47.120]   lot of, you know, punching the gut relevant, you know, kind of
[02:18:47.120 --> 02:18:52.120]   space explorations, you know, over the last 30 years and now we are
[02:18:52.120 --> 02:18:54.120]   entering, in my opinion, a golden age for that.
[02:18:54.120 --> 02:18:55.120]   I hope you're right.
[02:18:55.120 --> 02:18:58.120]   You know, we are, we are going to see with companies like SpaceX
[02:18:58.120 --> 02:19:02.120]   and cheaper, you know, and hopefully if Elon Musk is correct,
[02:19:02.120 --> 02:19:06.120]   reusable rockets, you know, this is going to be a more regular
[02:19:06.120 --> 02:19:10.120]   part of our lives and we can push the exploration for the human
[02:19:10.120 --> 02:19:14.120]   race in, you know, into just fantastic, amazing places in our
[02:19:14.120 --> 02:19:17.120]   lifetime, which is something that's fascinating and super cool.
[02:19:17.120 --> 02:19:19.120]   So I'm pretty, I'm pretty excited and we put some really good
[02:19:19.120 --> 02:19:23.120]   coverage together for, and by the way, Leo, I think NBC is
[02:19:23.120 --> 02:19:26.120]   going to have the landing on Tuesday.
[02:19:26.120 --> 02:19:27.120]   Yes, yeah.
[02:19:27.120 --> 02:19:31.120]   So, but they'll have commentary so we all understand it.
[02:19:31.120 --> 02:19:33.120]   Brilliant, incisive commentary.
[02:19:33.120 --> 02:19:35.120]   Yeah, I'm going to leave that as Mike closing.
[02:19:35.120 --> 02:19:37.120]   Thank you, Ed bot.
[02:19:37.120 --> 02:19:38.120]   Great to have you here.
[02:19:38.120 --> 02:19:39.120]   I really appreciate it.
[02:19:39.120 --> 02:19:43.120]   You catch Ed bot on ZDNet, of course, where he reports on
[02:19:43.120 --> 02:19:44.120]   Microsoft and other things.
[02:19:44.120 --> 02:19:47.120]   You're going to be reporting a lot on the trials, I'm sure, of
[02:19:47.120 --> 02:19:49.120]   Samsung and a lot more.
[02:19:49.120 --> 02:19:50.120]   It's great to see you again.
[02:19:50.120 --> 02:19:51.120]   Thank you.
[02:19:51.120 --> 02:19:52.120]   Just, just a doria.
[02:19:52.120 --> 02:19:53.120]   Thank you, Ed.
[02:19:53.120 --> 02:19:54.120]   Thank you, Ed.
[02:19:54.120 --> 02:19:58.120]   If you missed anything on Twit this week, we had a bunch of
[02:19:58.120 --> 02:20:01.120]   great shows, including you, Patrick Norton, watch.
[02:20:01.120 --> 02:20:02.120]   Be afraid.
[02:20:02.120 --> 02:20:04.120]   Previously on Twit.
[02:20:04.120 --> 02:20:06.120]   Do you want a faster gaming PC?
[02:20:06.120 --> 02:20:07.120]   I do.
[02:20:07.120 --> 02:20:09.120]   You want to spend all your money on a gaming PC?
[02:20:09.120 --> 02:20:10.120]   No.
[02:20:10.120 --> 02:20:12.120]   You want to waste your money when you're buying your next upgrade for
[02:20:12.120 --> 02:20:13.120]   hardware?
[02:20:13.120 --> 02:20:14.120]   No.
[02:20:14.120 --> 02:20:15.120]   Then you should be watching Twits this week in computer
[02:20:15.120 --> 02:20:16.120]   hardware.
[02:20:16.120 --> 02:20:17.120]   Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Ryan Shrouds.
[02:20:17.120 --> 02:20:20.120]   That was a big audience you guys had.
[02:20:20.120 --> 02:20:25.120]   The fans lined up outside the waiting to see.
[02:20:25.120 --> 02:20:26.120]   They're so excited.
[02:20:26.120 --> 02:20:29.120]   And I gave them ten bucks to walk back and forth.
[02:20:29.120 --> 02:20:30.120]   Here's the fan.
[02:20:30.120 --> 02:20:33.120]   Oh, no, I'm pretty new man.
[02:20:33.120 --> 02:20:35.120]   Man asked F.W.
[02:20:35.120 --> 02:20:38.120]   This is good.
[02:20:38.120 --> 02:20:39.120]   This is Twits.
[02:20:39.120 --> 02:20:40.120]   It's okay.
[02:20:40.120 --> 02:20:42.120]   Tech news today.
[02:20:42.120 --> 02:20:45.120]   And we've got something we like to call the Callen Duma.
[02:20:45.120 --> 02:20:49.120]   That's when a calendar and a rumor love each other very very
[02:20:49.120 --> 02:20:50.120]   much.
[02:20:50.120 --> 02:20:54.120]   If you missed this week on Twit, you missed a lot.
[02:20:54.120 --> 02:20:56.120]   That was the band Ready, Set, Go.
[02:20:56.120 --> 02:20:57.120]   They were...
[02:20:57.120 --> 02:20:58.120]   Get set, go.
[02:20:58.120 --> 02:20:59.120]   Yeah.
[02:20:59.120 --> 02:21:00.120]   They were great.
[02:21:00.120 --> 02:21:02.120]   And that was the scene from Game of Thrones.
[02:21:02.120 --> 02:21:03.120]   Game of Thrones, whoa.
[02:21:03.120 --> 02:21:04.120]   No, they killed it.
[02:21:04.120 --> 02:21:06.120]   That was two weeks ago on the show.
[02:21:06.120 --> 02:21:07.120]   We actually took this very spot.
[02:21:07.120 --> 02:21:08.120]   This is where they played.
[02:21:08.120 --> 02:21:11.120]   And thanks to the amazing Twits staff Chad and Jammerby and
[02:21:11.120 --> 02:21:12.120]   everybody.
[02:21:12.120 --> 02:21:17.120]   They turned this round table set into a viable live, you know,
[02:21:17.120 --> 02:21:20.120]   recording space and they were great.
[02:21:20.120 --> 02:21:21.120]   Go watch that.
[02:21:21.120 --> 02:21:23.120]   We left it out of the promo last week and I said, you got to
[02:21:23.120 --> 02:21:25.120]   get into the promo because that was one of the best things
[02:21:25.120 --> 02:21:26.120]   we've done here in the studio.
[02:21:26.120 --> 02:21:28.120]   So it's two weeks ago NSFW.
[02:21:28.120 --> 02:21:30.120]   Last week was the launch of the Diamond Club.
[02:21:30.120 --> 02:21:33.120]   So, man, if you're missing NSFW, you're missing a ton.
[02:21:33.120 --> 02:21:36.120]   Not for the little kids, not for the little ones.
[02:21:36.120 --> 02:21:38.120]   Save that for the next time you're on a gay cruise.
[02:21:38.120 --> 02:21:42.120]   But it's really worth listening to Twit.TV/NSFWaudio.
[02:21:42.120 --> 02:21:43.120]   But do watch the video.
[02:21:43.120 --> 02:21:44.120]   Yeah, the video.
[02:21:44.120 --> 02:21:45.120]   We do a lot on video.
[02:21:45.120 --> 02:21:48.120]   And I've just gotten word that I will be part of the Mars
[02:21:48.120 --> 02:21:49.120]   Curiosity.
[02:21:49.120 --> 02:21:51.120]   Are you going to cover tonight?
[02:21:51.120 --> 02:21:52.120]   I'm just going to hang out.
[02:21:52.120 --> 02:21:53.120]   You're just going to stick around?
[02:21:53.120 --> 02:21:54.120]   Yeah.
[02:21:54.120 --> 02:21:55.120]   Awesome.
[02:21:55.120 --> 02:22:00.120]   So, Tom, we might even if his plane arrives on time from Jakarta,
[02:22:00.120 --> 02:22:02.120]   we might even get a Brian Brushwood as well.
[02:22:02.120 --> 02:22:04.120]   He's in Jakarta?
[02:22:04.120 --> 02:22:05.120]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:22:05.120 --> 02:22:06.120]   It was in Indonesia for the last week.
[02:22:06.120 --> 02:22:07.120]   For a gig?
[02:22:07.120 --> 02:22:08.120]   For a gig?
[02:22:08.120 --> 02:22:09.120]   For a gig?
[02:22:09.120 --> 02:22:10.120]   For a gig or vacation?
[02:22:10.120 --> 02:22:11.120]   Gig.
[02:22:11.120 --> 02:22:12.120]   Yeah.
[02:22:12.120 --> 02:22:13.120]   Wow.
[02:22:13.120 --> 02:22:14.120]   That's impressive.
[02:22:14.120 --> 02:22:16.120]   This guy here, Patrick Norton, of the great host of Tekzilla,
[02:22:16.120 --> 02:22:18.120]   T-E-K-Z-I-L-L-A.com.
[02:22:18.120 --> 02:22:19.120]   It's a great show.
[02:22:19.120 --> 02:22:20.120]   You got to watch.
[02:22:20.120 --> 02:22:21.120]   Thank you so much.
[02:22:21.120 --> 02:22:22.120]   Yeah.
[02:22:22.120 --> 02:22:23.120]   Yeah.
[02:22:23.120 --> 02:22:24.120]   It's fun.
[02:22:24.120 --> 02:22:25.120]   Shark Week this week?
[02:22:25.120 --> 02:22:26.120]   Shark Week next week.
[02:22:26.120 --> 02:22:27.120]   I thought I was joking.
[02:22:27.120 --> 02:22:28.120]   What are you going to do?
[02:22:28.120 --> 02:22:29.120]   I had to upgrade the shark.
[02:22:29.120 --> 02:22:30.120]   No, no, no, no, no.
[02:22:30.120 --> 02:22:35.120]   There's been an interesting-- basically, there's been a survey
[02:22:35.120 --> 02:22:38.120]   of Pacific Predators top.
[02:22:38.120 --> 02:22:41.120]   And we talked about how they use digital technology to actually
[02:22:41.120 --> 02:22:46.120]   track sharks and other predators in the Pacific and found some incredible stuff over the last
[02:22:46.120 --> 02:22:47.120]   10 years.
[02:22:47.120 --> 02:22:50.120]   And actually, some of the technology they're using to figure out some of the last of the
[02:22:50.120 --> 02:22:53.120]   really amazing secrets about white sharks.
[02:22:53.120 --> 02:22:54.120]   That's awesome.
[02:22:54.120 --> 02:22:58.120]   You're taking Shark Week to a whole new level of actual geekiness.
[02:22:58.120 --> 02:22:59.120]   Of actual geekiness.
[02:22:59.120 --> 02:23:04.120]   Next week on the show, Kevin Rose will be here to talk about the newdig.com, what he's doing at
[02:23:04.120 --> 02:23:06.120]   Google, and a whole lot more.
[02:23:06.120 --> 02:23:07.120]   I kind of like the newdig.com.
[02:23:07.120 --> 02:23:09.120]   It's like Pinterest for tech news.
[02:23:09.120 --> 02:23:11.120]   It looks good.
[02:23:11.120 --> 02:23:17.120]   I'll tell you what, when the Diamond Club thing broke on Reddit, you kind of got to look at
[02:23:17.120 --> 02:23:22.120]   -- we got sort of the both barrels front page of Reddit treatment.
[02:23:22.120 --> 02:23:24.120]   And it's one of those things Brian pointed out.
[02:23:24.120 --> 02:23:28.120]   I don't know if I totally agree with him, but I see his point that you're starting to get
[02:23:28.120 --> 02:23:36.120]   that same kind of maybe aggressive mean mentality that was on dig before dig kind of--
[02:23:36.120 --> 02:23:37.120]   The edge is back.
[02:23:37.120 --> 02:23:38.120]   You're saying Reddit's getting mean.
[02:23:38.120 --> 02:23:42.120]   Well, more-- I mean, I guess I'm not a gigantic Redditor.
[02:23:42.120 --> 02:23:43.120]   You know, like I'm--
[02:23:43.120 --> 02:23:45.120]   And don't knock my Redditors, baby.
[02:23:45.120 --> 02:23:46.120]   Oh, I love-- I love Reddit.
[02:23:46.120 --> 02:23:50.120]   I mean, like, we've used Reddit for a lot of stuff, but I've usually only been on Reddit's
[02:23:50.120 --> 02:23:52.120]   where they've been four our communities.
[02:23:52.120 --> 02:23:53.120]   Oh, yeah.
[02:23:53.120 --> 02:23:56.120]   You don't want to make enemies, which is why I'm shutting you up right now.
[02:23:56.120 --> 02:23:57.120]   So--
[02:23:57.120 --> 02:23:58.120]   [laughter]
[02:23:58.120 --> 02:24:00.120]   Get at me, dog.
[02:24:00.120 --> 02:24:04.120]   His name is-- what should I-- what should I--
[02:24:04.120 --> 02:24:06.120]   His name is Dan Benjamin.
[02:24:06.120 --> 02:24:08.120]   Dan Benjamin, you can catch him on five by five.
[02:24:08.120 --> 02:24:09.120]   Exactly.
[02:24:09.120 --> 02:24:10.120]   No, there we go.
[02:24:10.120 --> 02:24:13.120]   Steve Kovac-- at Steve Kovac on Twitter.
[02:24:13.120 --> 02:24:14.120]   Send all your hate mail.
[02:24:14.120 --> 02:24:15.120]   Thanks for joining us.
[02:24:15.120 --> 02:24:19.120]   We do Twitter every Sunday afternoon, three o'clock until dusk.
[02:24:19.120 --> 02:24:20.120]   [laughter]
[02:24:20.120 --> 02:24:22.120]   It goes all day, all night.
[02:24:22.120 --> 02:24:23.120]   We might stay to Lamar's landing.
[02:24:23.120 --> 02:24:24.120]   I don't know.
[02:24:24.120 --> 02:24:25.120]   No, yeah.
[02:24:25.120 --> 02:24:26.120]   We've got like 80 people here.
[02:24:26.120 --> 02:24:27.120]   We're going to serve them all hot coco--
[02:24:27.120 --> 02:24:28.120]   Let's feed them because they're--
[02:24:28.120 --> 02:24:29.120]   We're doing it all night.
[02:24:29.120 --> 02:24:30.120]   The poor people are just dying.
[02:24:30.120 --> 02:24:32.120]   They've been here for so long, and we only have one toilet.
[02:24:32.120 --> 02:24:34.120]   So we're going to-- we're going to stop now.
[02:24:34.120 --> 02:24:36.120]   But do tune in.
[02:24:36.120 --> 02:24:38.120]   3 p.m. Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern time.
[02:24:38.120 --> 02:24:40.120]   2,200 UTC if you want to watch live on Sundays.
[02:24:40.120 --> 02:24:43.120]   But we make audio and video downloads available after the fact,
[02:24:43.120 --> 02:24:45.120]   always, on all the usual places.
[02:24:45.120 --> 02:24:46.120]   I get a lot of questions, people.
[02:24:46.120 --> 02:24:49.120]   What's the best way to make sure that I'm getting counted?
[02:24:49.120 --> 02:24:52.120]   Because I want to make sure that people know that Twitter has an audience.
[02:24:52.120 --> 02:24:54.120]   I mean, we do have a fantastic audience.
[02:24:54.120 --> 02:24:57.120]   And, you know, any way you watch it is fine with me.
[02:24:57.120 --> 02:24:59.120]   We'll count every single download.
[02:24:59.120 --> 02:25:03.120]   The only reason I say it's a good thing to subscribe is so you don't miss an episode.
[02:25:03.120 --> 02:25:05.120]   And I'd hate for you to miss anything that way.
[02:25:05.120 --> 02:25:09.120]   You make sure you get it automatically in the feed there.
[02:25:09.120 --> 02:25:11.120]   So subscribe on anything that you can use to subscribe.
[02:25:11.120 --> 02:25:12.120]   It doesn't really matter.
[02:25:12.120 --> 02:25:16.120]   Instacast, dog catcher, even that iTunes thing.
[02:25:16.120 --> 02:25:17.120]   Sure.
[02:25:17.120 --> 02:25:18.120]   We'll use that too.
[02:25:18.120 --> 02:25:19.120]   Thank you, everybody.
[02:25:19.120 --> 02:25:20.120]   See you next time.
[02:25:20.120 --> 02:25:22.120]   Another tweet is in the can.
[02:25:22.120 --> 02:25:24.120]   Thank you, everybody.
[02:25:24.120 --> 02:25:26.120]   [music]
[02:25:26.120 --> 02:25:33.120]   [music]
[02:25:33.120 --> 02:25:34.920]   >> All right.
