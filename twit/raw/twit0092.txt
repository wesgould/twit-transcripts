[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.840]   The Tiki Gods.
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:53.040]   [ Music ]
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.880]   Ladies and gentlemen, it's time for Twit in an unusual kind of a cast of twits
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:02.480]   this time. In fact, I really, I think, might be one of my favorite cast of Twit this time.
[00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.520]   Starting off with the guys from Tiki Bar TV, Tiki Bar.tv.
[00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:13.440]   Kevin Gamble and Jeff McPherson are Johnny Johnny and Dr. Tiki, respectively.
[00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.680]   Kevin, it's nice to have you. Thanks for joining us.
[00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:16.960]   Hey, thanks for having us, Leo.
[00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.080]   That's Johnny Johnny. I can even see his leopard fez right now.
[00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.200]   Yes, hello.
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.440]   And then Jeff McPherson is the good doctor.
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.360]   Hello, huh?
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.880]   I tried to get you on Twit when I've been a Tiki Bar fan since I think episode two.
[00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.640]   I just fell in love immediately.
[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.480]   And I sent you an email and at the time you said, "Oh yeah, I'll be on the show,
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.000]   but I have to stay in character."
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   Yes indeed.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.560]   Actually, I pulled that email up.
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.080]   Let me see if I can pull it up right now.
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.400]   It's framed over to me.
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.440]   And I thought, "Well, I could put him on, but I don't know.
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.120]   The conversation wouldn't go very far."
[00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.120]   I mean, no, it wouldn't.
[00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.000]   It's not a dream show.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.200]   A tech mala gee.
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.880]   But he really is Dr. Tiki, folks.
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:57.840]   And he is wearing the lab coat.
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.680]   He's got the clipboard and he's about to write you a prescription for a cocktail that you die for.
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.760]   In fact, Merlin Mann, who's also on with us from the merlin show.com.
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:06.400]   Hi, Merlin.
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.760]   How's it going, Leo?
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.120]   He asked Dr. Tiki for it.
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.600]   What was it?
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.160]   I need a 400 email backlog cocktail.
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.920]   Maybe something with gin and lime and some templates in a tall, tall glass.
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.240]   Would this be something you drink while answering 400 emails?
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.760]   I just helped me forget the pain as I judge through 400.
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.080]   You don't really have 400 backlog emails, do you?
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.720]   Oh, man.
[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:27.440]   It's a long story.
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.440]   I made this decision to start shutting off all of my over the transom public mail
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.320]   to this one Gmail account that I can really easily avoid.
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.080]   And then when I finally open it, it's like...
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.680]   I'm doing something like that now with...
[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.320]   Actually, Doc Serles, who was on the show last week, inspired me.
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:47.680]   He uses a service called 2IDI, which is one of these open ID companies.
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.000]   But every open ID company has some sort of secret sauce to add to the open ID.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.560]   And their open ID secret sauce is email.
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:00.240]   So if you go to LeoVille.com or my radio show site, and there's a contact
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.720]   meeting, what you'll get is a form at 2IDI.net.
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.360]   And then you fill out that form and it validates that it's you.
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.240]   So I thought, well, at least now I can put up a safe fee without worrying about spam and stuff.
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:18.240]   And the fact that you have to authenticate and all that might get people that doesn't help at all.
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.600]   Nothing else does it.
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:22.480]   One of the...
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:22.640]   How do I...
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:23.600]   For mortgage payments.
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.320]   I need a cocktail for 11,218 inbox messages.
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:29.200]   You got something like that?
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.960]   You don't have that many.
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:31.920]   Leo, Leo.
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:32.720]   Leo?
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:33.040]   Yes.
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:33.920]   You...
[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.040]   All your email goes to the same place for all your shows and your personal.
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.920]   Well, I use filtering.
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.320]   So if it comes with 2IDI, it goes into a separate folder.
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:40.480]   So...
[00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.480]   But it all goes in the same.
[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.800]   But the Tiki guys are going to now join the existing category of people who are constantly being
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.920]   pinged by people to go, "Hey, how's it going?" and I like to think, "Hey, can you give me Leo's email address?"
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.360]   Yeah, Bruno gets that.
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:56.320]   Bruno really gets that a lot.
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:57.600]   I'm sorry.
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.360]   No, it's like I'm your communication butler.
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.680]   I get a lot of people who have some very important business with you.
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.680]   I actually did that to get Leo's email.
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.120]   I am Kevin Rose and say, "Hey, Kevin, I need you to email address to me."
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.440]   Really?
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:08.800]   I almost did that.
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:09.520]   But you know what I did?
[00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.920]   I went back...
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:10.800]   I'm not even gonna sell you.
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:11.440]   What did you do, Dr?
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.760]   I went back and looked at the old email from Tiki.
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:16.800]   And so what did I say?
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.120]   Did I teach you what you said I want to stay in character?
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.320]   No, no.
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.040]   Do you want to hear what it is?
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:21.840]   I'll do it as Leo.
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.760]   Tiki Bartyvie is what my Vipod was made for.
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:26.640]   What is Vipod?
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.640]   That was one of your video...
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:29.840]   Video iPod.
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:30.800]   Video iPod.
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:31.360]   I understand it.
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:32.000]   That was the idea of...
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.440]   I'm allergic to them that didn't really take.
[00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:39.200]   Anyways, it says, "The whole world wants to know who you guys are.
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.840]   Would you be interested in a quick Skype interview for TWIT?
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.200]   We'd run it on our next episode.
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.240]   If you wish to remain anonymous, I'll understand."
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.800]   Because that was when you were cultivating that.
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.080]   That's right.
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.800]   Well, we were really taking advantage of the fact that nobody knew who we were.
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.080]   Before we go on, I really should...
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.040]   ...Porchregg is sitting here.
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.920]   I'm like, "He can't say anything because he's anonymous."
[00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:01.440]   Our fifth around the table is Craig Severson,
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.160]   the grunt media guy from Podgrunt.
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.320]   Is it Podgrunt.com or what are you, Grunt Duck?
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.920]   Gruntmedia.com is a me site, but Podgrunt and Video Grunt.
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:11.920]   We need more level from Craig.
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.040]   More level?
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.480]   I was complaining about how loud you were,
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.880]   and then I made a mistake because you've now become very quiet.
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.640]   Is this better?
[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.640]   Now more and more and more and more and more.
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:21.680]   More level, how's that?
[00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:22.400]   Yeah, perfect.
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:22.400]   There we go.
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:22.880]   There he is.
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:23.760]   There's Mr. Severson.
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:24.880]   There we are.
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.800]   Craig, you've heard Craig on this week in media.
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.000]   I think it's your first time on TWIT.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.840]   It is, except for being a guest at a show,
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.640]   at the podcast show down in Ontario.
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:38.320]   I'm actually like a pig in Doodoo right now,
[00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.480]   because these are four of my favorite guys
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:42.320]   in terms of user-generated content.
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.280]   That's what we're going to talk about today.
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:45.440]   But anyway, now that I've introduced you, Craig.
[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:45.920]   Yes.
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:47.840]   And it's gruntmedia.com.
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.600]   Is that the best site to give out for you?
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:49.920]   It is.
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.080]   Yeah, it's the central hub of all things.
[00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:52.400]   Okay.
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.800]   And I might add that I've checked,
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:59.200]   and in fact, Randy South says we are audible in talkshoe, so...
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:00.240]   Excellent.
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:00.800]   Cool.
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.400]   Consider that we are now live.
[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:03.760]   I can't get the talkshoe client up,
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.080]   but if I can, I will be taking questions later.
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:10.000]   Anyway, so what did you respond to that Vipod message?
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.320]   Oh, what did I do to that Vipod?
[00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.480]   Um, hi Leo.
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:14.720]   I've been...
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.560]   We need to get back to you.
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:17.360]   Oh, again, here.
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.160]   See, this was a backlog.
[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:18.640]   Yeah.
[00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:20.640]   Oh, I'm going to get my folder there.
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:21.360]   I'm sorry.
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:21.920]   I did.
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:24.800]   I appreciate the invite to be on Twitch,
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.720]   and would still like to take you up on your offer.
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.600]   It wasn't my intention to come to the show and character.
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.440]   I just wanted to avoid using my real name.
[00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.680]   But the cat is out of the bag now.
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:34.800]   So we were...
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:35.760]   Yeah, it was really interesting,
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:37.600]   because people were writing stories about,
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.480]   you know, this show, which is quite popular,
[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:43.200]   nobody knows who these people are or where they're from.
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:45.920]   And we sort of took advantage of that and thought,
[00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:49.360]   "This is funny, and this has really never been able to occur before,
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:53.760]   for people to put on a show and still be anonymous."
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:54.320]   It's great.
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:55.680]   Yeah, it was cool.
[00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:55.920]   Yeah.
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:00.000]   Well, I think Elvira did that, the mistress of the dark.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:02.720]   But nobody says Vira.
[00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:05.760]   But I mean, it wasn't just the performers that were anonymous.
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:07.120]   It was like, who's making this?
[00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:07.920]   What cities it made it?
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:08.560]   Where's it coming from?
[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:09.280]   Yeah.
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:10.080]   And plus, we were...
[00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:11.280]   And all of our sponsors didn't want to be known.
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:11.840]   You'd be so sure.
[00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:12.960]   Ha, ha, ha, ha.
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:18.320]   But you said, Kevin, that you kind of let the cat out of the bag a little bit.
[00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:20.560]   Well, we'd occasionally drop stuff on the show.
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:21.040]   We'd have...
[00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:22.160]   We'd spell something in a...
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:25.600]   You know, the Canadian spelling, "Color with a U" and so our fans would hop online,
[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:27.360]   saying, "Ah, they spelled color with a U!"
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:28.160]   They got to be Canadian.
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.920]   They're either Irish or Canadian, right?
[00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:31.760]   Yeah, and we didn't talk like Fisher and Canada.
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:33.040]   We were obviously from Western Canada,
[00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:34.720]   so they were starting like narrowing in on us.
[00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:35.760]   Good, we're...
[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:36.320]   Yeah.
[00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:36.480]   Yep.
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:38.400]   I wrote the name like "Regginal Tortonstein."
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:40.960]   I mean, you kind of want to, you know, kind of want to hide that.
[00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:43.520]   Who's the man behind "Regginal Tortonstein"?
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:44.400]   We're just...
[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:46.880]   That's Dastin and Hornstein.
[00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:47.440]   And it turns out...
[00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:48.800]   Hornstein is dancing the name as well.
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:50.160]   It's actually Hornstein.
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:50.880]   Yeah, what is...
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:52.800]   Actually, a girl who's like, "Suison Hornstein."
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.560]   I have Hornstein actually emailed and said,
[00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:55.840]   "That's your mispronouncing the name."
[00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:57.200]   That's your...
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:58.080]   Your own name.
[00:07:58.080 --> 00:07:59.920]   You're mispronouncing your own fake name.
[00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:01.760]   I thought I kind of invented it,
[00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:03.600]   but apparently I did not invent that name.
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:04.560]   It already existed.
[00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:06.880]   There's a clan of angry Hornstein's that are pictured with...
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:10.800]   Hornstein Hornstein!
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.320]   This man is the Antichrist!
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:15.600]   You guys...
[00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:19.280]   I mean, if people are listening right now who haven't seen Tiki Bar,
[00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:22.160]   pause your Vipod.
[00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:28.560]   And download it right now because you've got to see what we're talking about.
[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:31.680]   And there's a third member of the cast, La La,
[00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:33.680]   but she's actually a computer-generated,
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:35.120]   so we can't really interview her.
[00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:36.880]   She's like Max Hedrum.
[00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:39.200]   She doesn't exist outside the walls of the interweb.
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:41.440]   But there's nobody shows much interest in her anyway,
[00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:42.480]   so we feel alright.
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:42.960]   She's really...
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:43.280]   I know.
[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:44.720]   People come to the show for us, really.
[00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:46.880]   I come for the Fez.
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:47.920]   Yes, thank you.
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:49.520]   I came for the Fez and stayed for the Vipod.
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:51.200]   Stayed for the La La.
[00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:54.160]   I thought this would be an apt time to get all of you on,
[00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:55.840]   because you all do video podcasts.
[00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:57.520]   Merlin does the new one, the Merlin Show,
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:59.280]   which is doing quite well, I understand.
[00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:02.080]   Yeah, I mean, yeah.
[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:04.160]   That pause is for you to bake a plug
[00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:05.360]   for how good you're doing.
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:07.360]   Well, actually, Leo, I'm really glad you asked me that.
[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:08.000]   Yeah, thank you.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.560]   It's actually not too bad.
[00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:15.200]   We had a nice little break-through on the tech area of iTunes.
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:17.360]   Well, I mean, that's one thing that might be interesting to talk about,
[00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:21.200]   is how iTunes has become sort of the Billboard charts for podcasts.
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:23.280]   Well, and that's kind of what I was going to talk about,
[00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:25.200]   which is now that Apple TV is out.
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.480]   It's really a new playing field.
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:30.160]   So you've got the Merlin Show, obviously, Tiki Bar TV is video.
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:34.000]   30-some episodes out, 33, something like that.
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:35.360]   For Tiki Bar?
[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:35.920]   Yeah, how many?
[00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:37.520]   20, 23, 23.
[00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:41.600]   20, 24 coming out in shortly, a couple days or something.
[00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:47.360]   And Craig does a really good podcast called Video Grunt, all about video.
[00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:49.840]   Right. This is all professional looking.
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:50.720]   His looks real good.
[00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:51.840]   Yeah, and stuff.
[00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:56.000]   You know, well, I learned when we have,
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.520]   this is now, I don't know, this is going to be so confusing.
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:02.640]   We will have Kevin and Jeff on the lab,
[00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:05.680]   but we already taped it last week talking about Tiki.
[00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:08.800]   And I had no idea how much work you put into it.
[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:11.120]   We put at least an hour in every episode.
[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:11.280]   Yeah.
[00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:16.240]   I mean, it is a huge, not only you tape for eight hours,
[00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:19.360]   but you edit for days and weeks and months.
[00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:19.840]   Yeah.
[00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:21.600]   There's a fair bit of consuming in there.
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.200]   Well, eight hours of, you know,
[00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:26.080]   from the first drink being poured to the cab's being called to take his home.
[00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:28.720]   Yeah, that's where I, that's how I had time it.
[00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:30.800]   Anyway, how does Apple TV change all this?
[00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:32.560]   I installed, I got Merlin, you got one, right?
[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:34.480]   Oh, yeah, I did.
[00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:36.160]   And I'm having a heck of a time with it.
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:36.640]   It's funny.
[00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:38.320]   Merlin, you had so much trouble because I,
[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:39.360]   how is this?
[00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:41.200]   I got the new airport extreme and it installed fine.
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:42.400]   I got the new Apple TV.
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:43.920]   I installed it like it was midnight.
[00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:45.040]   I installed it 10 minutes later.
[00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:46.000]   It was working great.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.520]   No, no, mine's working great.
[00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:48.080]   Oh, okay.
[00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:49.360]   I'm very happy with it.
[00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:50.000]   Who else has one?
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.520]   Do you guys have one or Greg?
[00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:52.080]   Do you have one?
[00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:53.120]   Not yet.
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:54.800]   I'm waiting for a better input manager.
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:56.000]   There.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.840]   Whatever that is.
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:58.960]   Discussion error later.
[00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:01.280]   No, not yet.
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:03.520]   Alex got one, so he's going to work out the bugs.
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:04.560]   I've been happy.
[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:05.680]   I'll have some negatives.
[00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:07.680]   But let me ask you, Merlin, what was your experience?
[00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:11.040]   Well, first of all, the setup, as I hope,
[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:11.520]   well, it's funny.
[00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:13.040]   We talked about this a little bit on Macbreak Weekly.
[00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:14.960]   This is the whole thing with Apple's products,
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:18.000]   kind of either stand or fall based so much on how they feel to use,
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.080]   you know, when you're actually putting your hands to them.
[00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:21.920]   And I think the experience of it,
[00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:24.000]   one of the best parts of it, to be honest, was the setting up.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.440]   It was just, it was really easy as opposed to my airport experience.
[00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:29.520]   But the, yeah, it's setup really easy.
[00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:32.640]   Hooked up fine and automatically discovered
[00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:35.600]   what turned out to be the computer that was right next to the computer.
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:38.000]   Excuse me, right next to the TV to do the syncing.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.280]   So yeah, I think that worked great.
[00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:42.960]   And it's, to really, it almost, it probably shares almost,
[00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:45.760]   I would say 90% of its DNA with the iPod experience,
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:47.040]   just in terms of syncing.
[00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:50.560]   It won't play the same movies that iTunes will play necessarily.
[00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:50.960]   Oh, really?
[00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:52.480]   So you found some content that it wouldn't.
[00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:55.280]   Well, it once, I don't know if this has to do with streaming,
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:56.480]   or if it's an arbitrary decision,
[00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:59.120]   but it wants everything to be an MP4, I believe.
[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:00.160]   There's some that will be playing.
[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:00.560]   It's played everything.
[00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:02.720]   Oh yeah, because there are some of our high-def stuff
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:06.320]   that would play and iTunes on Mac break will not play on the Apple TV.
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:08.160]   But what you got to say, did you guys see the hack?
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:08.960]   That's great.
[00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:10.960]   It's just, you sync it and then it just pushes out.
[00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:12.160]   Somebody, somebody took the image,
[00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:14.240]   are you talking about the one, the guy who took the image off of it?
[00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:15.440]   I know somebody, somebody,
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:17.440]   somebody, I've rejigged their Apple TV already.
[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:19.440]   They've already figured out where to put bigger hard drives in it.
[00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:19.680]   Yeah.
[00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:21.360]   And you can run X-Vid-Divex onto this one.
[00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:23.280]   Ah, that's what I'm going to point.
[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:24.640]   Because all of the, all the, all the,
[00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:27.600]   the powers and the hands of nerds that, that's what this thing can do.
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:30.160]   Well, and somebody's already posted the image, the drive image,
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:32.720]   and apparently it's stripped down OS X and will run on other Macs.
[00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:34.080]   So, oh my goodness.
[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:36.560]   It's, it's pretty, pretty well-behacked, I would say.
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:39.920]   What was that like, it hasn't even arrived in stores in Canada yet,
[00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:41.200]   and it's already fedora part.
[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:42.800]   Well, that's good.
[00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:44.960]   See, that's one of the reasons we delay shipment to Canada
[00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:48.000]   so that you guys can stand on the shoulders of giants.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.200]   That's right.
[00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:54.480]   For those of you who aren't fans of Sir Isaac Newton,
[00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:56.880]   I'm not insulting the Canadians, okay?
[00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:57.280]   No.
[00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:57.840]   No.
[00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:02.720]   Uh, I have to say the thing that, to me, excited me and, and, and, and prompt me
[00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:05.280]   to get this group together is that very prominently,
[00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:09.280]   along with TV shows and movies, there's an entry, podcasts.
[00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:12.560]   And Tiki Bar, I played Tiki Bar immediately on it.
[00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:17.600]   It shows up, it's, you're on a par now, with lost and the office.
[00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:19.280]   I mean, it's just another one of my shows.
[00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:21.600]   That's uh, how awesome is that?
[00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:22.480]   That's pretty crazy.
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:24.080]   That's great.
[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:24.800]   It's so cool.
[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:27.440]   I haven't heard people gathering on the water cooler asking how we know what the
[00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:28.880]   profits of Tiki Bar are.
[00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:29.120]   Yeah.
[00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:31.200]   Oh, you don't stand around the same water coolers I do.
[00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:34.480]   Mostly they say, so how can I meet Lala?
[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:37.600]   Mostly what they're saying right now.
[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:40.320]   We should, we should bring her on the lab.
[00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:44.560]   We'll have to be some kind of a special party, party event.
[00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:46.080]   Oh, there's a pretty PG show though, isn't it?
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:48.400]   The lab with the, yeah, it's G baby.
[00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:48.880]   G G.
[00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:49.200]   Okay.
[00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:50.640]   Why is Lala foul-mouthed?
[00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:57.520]   Oh no, I should mention that Tiki Bar probably isn't for the children.
[00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:02.320]   No, Lala has been known to admit an exploit of her too, but it's, it's all in good fun.
[00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:04.800]   Oh yeah, she can control herself in public.
[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:05.520]   I just thought that.
[00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:07.840]   It's rad.
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:11.920]   A dance.
[00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:12.720]   We could come and dance.
[00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:12.800]   All right.
[00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:14.240]   Who just opened up the internet?
[00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:15.200]   I heard that.
[00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:16.480]   Who did I actually?
[00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:17.920]   I was actually a Coca-Cola beverage.
[00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:18.480]   I'm enjoying it.
[00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:19.040]   Oh yeah, sure.
[00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:19.760]   Johnny.
[00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:22.480]   Do people come up to you?
[00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:24.800]   I mean, they must assume that you are heavy drinkers.
[00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:26.720]   They would assume correctly.
[00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:32.480]   Actually, we tried that actually.
[00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:34.400]   I crashed a dig taping.
[00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:39.680]   I go to Comic Con every year for work because I do work on the side outside of the...
[00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:40.240]   We should mention this.
[00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:44.240]   You work in the real traditional business as a producer of cartoon.
[00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:45.840]   I sort of straddle both worlds.
[00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:49.920]   I made an old school media in the traditional broadcast model and also in New Media, which is kind of cool.
[00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:54.240]   So I do, right now I'm producing a series for Cartoon Network and a tele-tune here in Canada,
[00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:55.680]   where we're doing George of the Jungle.
[00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:58.160]   So I'm producing that, which will be on the air in the summer.
[00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:00.960]   George, George, George, George, George, George.
[00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:02.480]   What did George and Stock please be?
[00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:02.960]   Stop singing.
[00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:04.720]   Oh, you're probably so sick of that.
[00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:05.200]   I heard it.
[00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:06.400]   So many times.
[00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:08.720]   Oh, fang, no George.
[00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:09.280]   I'm not Jack now.
[00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:12.080]   It's like, if maybe I see one more guy hit a tree again.
[00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:14.320]   The show's looking great.
[00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:14.880]   So that's really cool.
[00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:17.040]   Is it CGI or is it standard cell animation?
[00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:17.760]   No, it's Flash.
[00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:18.400]   It's a Flash show.
[00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:20.320]   So it's a painted background of Flash animation.
[00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:25.360]   But I go to Comic Con every year to sort of look for new stuff and everything and they're taping a
[00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:26.320]   dignity there.
[00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:29.760]   And so I went to the dignity and taping and we had this funny thing where Johnny Johnny was going to arrive
[00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:31.040]   and hand out some cocktails and stuff.
[00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:34.320]   It was my first time sort of putting on the Fez in public and walking around,
[00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:36.160]   which is a totally cool experience because people are like,
[00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:37.200]   "We share a lot of the same fans.
[00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:39.600]   Guys who watch Dig, also watch Twit, also watch Digivar."
[00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:43.360]   Afterwards, everybody wanted to do a shooter with Johnny Johnny.
[00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:44.400]   I'm like, "Oh, yeah."
[00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:46.480]   "Hey, Johnny Johnny is doing a shooter.
[00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:47.440]   Am I you bet?"
[00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:52.640]   And that was my first time not saying no and also the last time.
[00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:55.040]   Now you know Alex Albrecht's pain weekly.
[00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:58.800]   And he kept sliding them over to me and asking me,
[00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:00.320]   it was just, it was rapping.
[00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:01.520]   Kevin was ditching them.
[00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:03.760]   Kevin Rose was actually hiding them.
[00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:08.000]   He was tossing them over the bar and trying to just ditch them.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.040]   He was actually doing shoots.
[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:10.000]   I can actually talk to Kevin.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.040]   I think I mentioned this before because I loved Ignatian,
[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:14.000]   but I really wish they would.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.880]   It feels to me like they promote binge drinking.
[00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:20.400]   And frankly, I think kids listen and watch the dignity.
[00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:25.440]   His audience is very much teenagers and it bothers me.
[00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:27.200]   Now you guys are clearly aimed at adults.
[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:31.040]   We certainly have the explicit rating on iTunes.
[00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:35.680]   I mean, we're not a show for the 6 to 11 crowd.
[00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:36.080]   Yeah.
[00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:39.200]   But it is something that we take into account and that I think about.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.920]   When we started the show, there was no audience.
[00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:46.400]   So we thought maybe if there was a couple hundred people watching,
[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:49.280]   what did this behavior matter?
[00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:52.320]   And in fact, we were sort of mocking and satirizing
[00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:57.360]   collegiate drinking and just being fools.
[00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:00.080]   And now that there's hundreds of thousands of people watching,
[00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:00.880]   we do think about it.
[00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:04.720]   We think like, are we still letting people know that it is a show?
[00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:06.160]   Well, we are enjoying some drinks.
[00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:12.400]   The joke of the foster brooks, the Dean Martin excessive drinking is the joke.
[00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:14.000]   We're not really pounding.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:19.360]   It's happened on one or two episodes where there's been a few cocktails.
[00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:21.200]   But I think about that.
[00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:22.640]   I'd like to actually.
[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:24.640]   I'm glad.
[00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:27.040]   I mean, they think there's still something else going on in there apart from
[00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:29.360]   a little very much so.
[00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:32.320]   And the way Dig to Me is gone wild is a little different.
[00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:34.160]   And that's one of the things I don't like about Dig Nation.
[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:35.040]   I've talked to Kevin about it.
[00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:36.000]   He said, well, yeah, we're.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.240]   I know and Kevin is sensitive to this.
[00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:40.880]   And he said, yeah, we're going to cut it out, face it out at the end of 2007.
[00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:42.800]   I see.
[00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:43.600]   It's interesting.
[00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:45.680]   I don't think it's quite true.
[00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:47.120]   I mean, I'm entertained by it.
[00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:49.520]   I find them wildly entertaining these guys.
[00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:50.960]   I'm such charismatic fellows too.
[00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:53.520]   Like when you get on a roll, those two are just so fun to watch.
[00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:54.560]   They're so energetic.
[00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:55.600]   Alex is a hoot too.
[00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:56.640]   I mean, he's really, really nice.
[00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:57.120]   I would.
[00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:59.120]   You know, just on one final note on that drinking thing,
[00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:01.360]   I would, you know, I've thought so many times about,
[00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:04.240]   do we add the drink responsibly to the end of the episode?
[00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:05.120]   Please.
[00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:07.280]   But yeah, here's the problem I have with that.
[00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:10.560]   It's like our little slogan, one line of slogan,
[00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:14.000]   cannot take place of, you know, years worth of good parenting.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.440]   Like I can't.
[00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:19.360]   If that little line really does change,
[00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:21.440]   whether or not you're going to get behind the wheel of a car
[00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:24.000]   or get into a bar fight, I just don't believe it.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.280]   I don't believe that little slogan.
[00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:27.760]   Not with the healthy younger audience either.
[00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:30.720]   It'll just be taken as exactly the opposite, I think.
[00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:32.080]   Yeah, it's just, it's like.
[00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:33.440]   You know, man.
[00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:34.640]   Even car commercials.
[00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:37.680]   Why, I mean, it's insulting in a car commercial when it says,
[00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:40.240]   this is a closed course by a professional driver.
[00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:43.440]   Do not attempt to drive your vehicle on high tension lines,
[00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:44.480]   300 feet above the ground.
[00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:46.800]   Right.
[00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:49.040]   Well, it's interesting and this raises the issue.
[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:53.040]   I mean, when you're a sideline, you know, a subculture medium,
[00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:56.320]   it doesn't matter so much, but increasingly we have to face
[00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:58.720]   these issues as we move into the mainstream.
[00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:01.760]   And is the fact that podcasting is on Apple TV
[00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:06.640]   and is a par with other media now pose a whole new set of problems?
[00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:07.600]   Merlin, what do you think?
[00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:10.400]   You know, I think it kind of does.
[00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:12.560]   I mean, one thing that I really like about podcasting,
[00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:15.840]   apart from the fact that it's pretty easy to kind of bootstrap your show,
[00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:20.480]   is the fact that, you know, you really can kind of focus on a fairly narrow
[00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:24.000]   slice of pie in terms of the people that you're very narrow in this case.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.840]   You don't need to be satisfying the audience to watch tappy days.
[00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:28.320]   Right.
[00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:28.960]   Definitely not.
[00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:29.440]   No.
[00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:31.840]   That's ironic because Twitter is as narrow as you can get.
[00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:35.520]   In fact, all of the Twitter podcasts are very narrowly focused and yet they do very well.
[00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:39.360]   But I think the surprising thing happens with like you guys like,
[00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:42.160]   so I mean, like one thing that's funny, any time you do something creative,
[00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:45.440]   I think it's always interesting to look back at what you thought was going to be the hook
[00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:49.520]   when you started versus what it ends up being after people after the world has kind of decided
[00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:50.480]   what's it what it's about.
[00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:54.560]   And so you may start out doing one thing and then find yourself going,
[00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:57.520]   oh, wow, well, people seem to really have connected with this character or this thing.
[00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:57.680]   Yeah.
[00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:01.760]   And that can be that can really kind of land you somewhere quite different.
[00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:05.360]   That is one of the negatives I was thinking of is that you're not your own property anymore.
[00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:07.120]   Oh, it's absolutely.
[00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:07.120]   Yeah.
[00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:08.320]   I mean, you can say whatever you want.
[00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:11.520]   I mean, you realize this is the first time you put up a blog post,
[00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:13.360]   you have as long as you want to prepare it.
[00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:15.840]   But then the world decides what it's really about after that.
[00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:18.960]   And that can sometimes be a really strange experience.
[00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:20.960]   Leo, to your point about Twit, though,
[00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:24.000]   Twit is it's a wide spectrum technology audience.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.240]   You're not super focused on one thing.
[00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:30.640]   But I mean, even when the fact that there is security now, which, you know, do well,
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:34.640]   I mean, these are niches that frankly, look what happened to Tech TV.
[00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:35.760]   We tried it and it failed.
[00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:39.440]   And I think that the networks in the US have decided there's no room for technology.
[00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:40.240]   But look at that cost.
[00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:43.360]   This is something that Alex Lindsey talks about a lot that I think is fascinating
[00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:46.800]   is the whole concept of what it costs you to shoot a minute of the show.
[00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:48.480]   Right. I mean, this costs nothing to do literally.
[00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:49.360]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:52.080]   And so I mean, even with the high quality that, you know,
[00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:54.160]   folks like the Tiki guys in Craig are making,
[00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:56.720]   you compare that to an episode of Law and Order.
[00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:58.560]   And I mean, obviously we're talking about a different scale,
[00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:00.640]   but you know, pound for pound, user for user,
[00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:02.160]   it's a much less costly experience.
[00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:05.440]   So you can afford to do stuff that's a little more segmented.
[00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:06.800]   But then it be catches on and.
[00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:07.760]   Well, that's what's interesting.
[00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:11.840]   I think in a way there's a big, there's such a big audience when you super serve a niche
[00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:14.800]   in a way that mass media doesn't do.
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:16.320]   Can't do.
[00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:16.880]   Can't do.
[00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:18.720]   You know, what's interesting, it's true.
[00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:21.200]   Like it would be a mistake for us to try and broaden our appeal
[00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:25.120]   because that's being handled by companies that have been doing it for 50 years
[00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:26.720]   and they have millions of dollars.
[00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:30.400]   So we really are trying to do the very best we can in our niche,
[00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:32.640]   as we say in Canada or niche down south.
[00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:36.880]   But super serve your niche.
[00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:41.120]   You know, my experience, when I watch Twitch, sorry, when I watch Twitch,
[00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:43.040]   I watch Dignation and listen to Twitch.
[00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:46.080]   I'm watching the guys on the sofa, you know,
[00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:50.240]   the level at which I am entertained is at par with other shows,
[00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:53.840]   like say, you know, watching, I don't know, lost.
[00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:58.400]   I am fully entertained and granted there are plenty of people that turn on
[00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:02.800]   Dignation and go, this, how could you possibly be interested in this?
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:06.720]   These are two drunk guys on a sofa talking into their laptops.
[00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:12.560]   But when you're really, you know, captivated and I see that when people come up to us
[00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:15.440]   and talk to us about how excited they are about Tiki Bar TV,
[00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:19.440]   they are as engaged and fully engaged and entertained
[00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:22.800]   as any of the other content that they're into.
[00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:25.200]   It's just that we're a niche.
[00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:27.920]   It is an amazing time that now we have.
[00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:29.200]   You've come by north, I did.
[00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:34.160]   Somebody take over with a better vocabulary.
[00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:34.480]   Go ahead.
[00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:37.360]   It's an amazing time now, like you say with Apple TV,
[00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:41.600]   that literally anybody with, you know, a Libson account and a Gmail account
[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:44.320]   can be a network television station.
[00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:45.760]   And that is, that's crazy.
[00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:50.560]   Like, there's a, Craig and I have been talking about this camera that's coming out next month
[00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:53.360]   that actually I have pre-ordered that Canon HV 20.
[00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:58.880]   And so you get a camera now for like 1,100 bucks that does HD and with HDMI out,
[00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:02.560]   it's just extraordinary to me with, for like say a four or $5,000 investment,
[00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:06.080]   you can have what used to cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, even like 10 years ago.
[00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:07.200]   And because you don't have this.
[00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:07.840]   Television.
[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:10.400]   And because you exactly, you don't have this corporate oversight,
[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:12.800]   suddenly you can be much more creative.
[00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:15.280]   You know, when Merlin and I were talking about, you know,
[00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:19.600]   what we would do on the, on a video show on the net, I said, you know,
[00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:23.680]   I look at the earliest days of television and think of the freedom
[00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:28.000]   that people had there because the medium wasn't defined.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   And I think we're in the same position now.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.440]   It's like 1948.
[00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:34.320]   I mean, they're really, we're still, this is sort, you know, it's still kind of wrestling
[00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:35.920]   and we can be Ernie Kovacs.
[00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:38.560]   I mean, you know, we can really create a new medium.
[00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:41.840]   And the other thing that's exciting about it.
[00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:42.880]   It's totally exciting.
[00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:48.320]   It's the, it's the short form video, you know, which, which all of us are experiencing,
[00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:51.680]   is that this, this whole medium allows us to do things that are short,
[00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:54.800]   which really hasn't happened in mass media except for cartoons.
[00:23:54.800 --> 00:24:00.240]   No, I think if we could do short films and there's been a dearth of places they could show those.
[00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:01.280]   Yes.
[00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:04.160]   And, but I'm talking about even, you know, five minutes and under.
[00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:08.480]   I mean, it's, it's really quite a, quite a wide opening, especially in the, in the world of,
[00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:09.760]   of nonfiction.
[00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:13.680]   I think it's especially challenging for the Tiki guys to do something that's fictional
[00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:16.560]   and really good, which I, which I think is amazing what they do.
[00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:18.400]   It's very hard.
[00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:18.800]   Yeah.
[00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:25.200]   Doing, doing nonfiction is a lot easier, but it's also gives us more documentary type people,
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:29.840]   this opportunity to create five minute programs, a series of them, you know, that would ever be
[00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:31.440]   able to happen before.
[00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:38.640]   I mean, I had a post on 43 folders about this is, is the whole challenge of HD and like, I've got,
[00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:40.800]   you know, whatever, the low end HD TV.
[00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:45.840]   I'd love to have stuff from iTunes in HD, but if it's going to be four gigs of downloading to get
[00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:51.520]   a movie, I may not wait for that, but I might get a 720p podcast that's five or 10 minutes long.
[00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:55.680]   So there's almost this competitive advantage to having short stuff because, you know, nobody's
[00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:57.520]   going to wait around for Norbit in HD.
[00:24:57.520 --> 00:24:58.000]   Thank God.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:04.080]   And I'm not convinced that the Apple TV is a huge thing for, for my particular audience.
[00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:08.400]   I don't feel I'm competing with Lost because I actually don't want my stuff to go big.
[00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:10.880]   I have no interest in someone watching video grunt on HD.
[00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:12.480]   But that's just me.
[00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:14.880]   My whole thing is I love the portability.
[00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:17.360]   I love the smallness of the efficiency of these things.
[00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:20.560]   And it's not, you know, my thing is not to sit down on the couch and watch it.
[00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:24.320]   Now I am going to sit down on the couch and watch Tiki Bar because that's more of an entertaining
[00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:27.040]   and it's more of a, you know, a fictional sort of fantasy world.
[00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:28.320]   It's still five minutes and you get up and you're done.
[00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:29.840]   I mean, it's like, there's all sorts of food.
[00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:33.120]   I can have a power bar and I can walk and eat that at the same time or I can have a great dinner.
[00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:33.920]   It takes three hours.
[00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:36.160]   I don't think anybody, you know, thinks that it's true.
[00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:38.560]   People who have power bar are these false dilemmas.
[00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:38.800]   Yeah.
[00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:41.760]   People are all going to consume dinner now in bar form.
[00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:43.360]   Who's ever going to sit down for dinner again?
[00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:50.240]   So like, it's all sorts of storytelling, all sorts of media, all sorts of stuff out there.
[00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:53.520]   And like the great thing about this stuff is you look and it's a story on the go.
[00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:56.320]   It's a five minute buy piece of media and you're good to go.
[00:25:56.320 --> 00:26:00.320]   Let's jump back and talk about, you know, competition again for a second,
[00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:01.360]   competing with one another.
[00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:05.760]   You know, when this podcasting video podcasting for sort of broke out
[00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:09.040]   and that would have been around the time that Jobs announced the video iPod or the
[00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:10.560]   Vipod as my friend of the board.
[00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:17.280]   But I remember sort of being advised by an agent friend of mine going,
[00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:20.560]   oh, you know, other people were emailing and going, how do you encode, you know,
[00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:22.400]   and what what frame are you using?
[00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:24.720]   And the agent said to me, oh, don't tell them.
[00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:26.080]   Don't give them competitive advantage.
[00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:26.560]   Right.
[00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:29.440]   And how are you promoting your podcast?
[00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:30.720]   What, you know, where are you listing it?
[00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:32.000]   Are you listing on podcast pickle?
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.200]   And and so I was sitting there going, oh, yeah, I got to be called.
[00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:36.320]   Don't tell anybody our secrets.
[00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:37.680]   I'm going, we don't have, wait a minute.
[00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:43.040]   We don't have a secret, you know, Apple noticed the show and then gave us a huge boost in PR,
[00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:46.800]   but pretty much the, you know, the internet people found the show.
[00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:52.800]   And and a further to that, like now I'm sharing information with anybody and have
[00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:57.840]   because I realized, you know, I'm not competing with it ninja audience or your audience or
[00:26:57.840 --> 00:26:58.800]   revision theory.
[00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:01.360]   It's not like TV in the 70s where you got three channels.
[00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:02.320]   There's no scale here.
[00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:05.920]   It's just a question of people wanting to put stuff in a queue and watch it at their convenience.
[00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:06.400]   Yeah.
[00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:09.280]   And we are all frontrunners of this new media and only by helping each other out,
[00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:13.040]   but we actually advance the form and by like, by talking with the dead guys and talking to the
[00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:15.680]   engine guys and talking to the homestar guys, we're all there.
[00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:18.400]   We're on the vanguard of this new brand of storytelling.
[00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:22.640]   Do you think this is because it's a new medium and that as we get successful and
[00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:26.800]   achieve parity with the networks, will we all become cutthroats once again?
[00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:28.560]   Or is this really a new era?
[00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:32.080]   If we're competing, this is if I'm going to jump in, but if we're competing,
[00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:33.280]   did I just mute?
[00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:33.360]   No.
[00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:33.760]   Hello.
[00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:34.000]   No.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:34.160]   No.
[00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:35.120]   Outstanding.
[00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:35.680]   Outstanding.
[00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:45.040]   If we're competing sort of with a portal or some technology based competition, yes, perhaps.
[00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:53.600]   But if it's on with entertainment value, frankly, I can't see how we're going to be competing with
[00:27:53.600 --> 00:28:00.320]   one another except for, you know, somebody, somebody said it was a, who's a TV producer from
[00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:06.240]   old media and he said a convention and he said, you know, if I have to depend on other people's
[00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:11.520]   inability to entertain their audience in order to capture an audience for myself, I don't, I don't
[00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:16.880]   deserve the audience. And so I thought that was interesting. Bernat, Mark Bernat, the guy who
[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:23.280]   created Survivor, and that was talking about the fear of competition in a wholly on-demand world
[00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:25.040]   where every show is always available.
[00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:27.600]   It's an attention competition.
[00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:32.560]   Anyways, I hope we don't, you know what, if we are competing against one another, we're probably
[00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:33.920]   very, very wealthy at that point.
[00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:41.360]   I would submit that it is a whole new hippie thing going on here that we are, it's no longer,
[00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:45.200]   I've been really thinking about this a lot in the last couple of weeks, that what seems to be
[00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:50.800]   happening is that the corporate environment doesn't suit this fast-paced internet world of ours.
[00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:56.480]   And at the same time, individuals have become so powerful thanks to these inexpensive digital
[00:28:56.480 --> 00:29:00.960]   technologies. Individuals now can compete. This is what we're seeing at a corporate level.
[00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:02.160]   Yes, they can.
[00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:07.280]   And but who we're competing with is corporations. And ultimately, I think what
[00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:12.240]   happens is you get these loose confederacies of people like all of us here who would
[00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:17.040]   in a corporate environment be at each other's throats, but in this modern kind of hippie environment,
[00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:21.600]   we're all working together to solve our problems. And I have a feeling that that may be the way
[00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:26.160]   it is going forward. It's a small-scale revolution.
[00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:30.080]   What's interesting, I guess, why I'm interested in participating with different people and
[00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:34.560]   what I choose to is that I'm really impressed with their work, you know, and especially with
[00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:37.680]   what you're doing, Leo. I mean, you're just, you're very entertaining and you're really
[00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:42.080]   bringing information across and it's like, you're good. And that's why we're here. And that's why
[00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:44.800]   we're, you know, we're talking to one another.
[00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:45.280]   And so...
[00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:50.320]   What about the issue that people raised that there's too much good stuff? And a lot of good
[00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:53.120]   stuff is going to start falling through the cracks because nobody can keep up.
[00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:54.560]   There's too many podcasts already.
[00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:55.760]   Oh, there's a lot of that stuff too.
[00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:59.120]   You don't need everybody to keep up there. You just need the people in your audience to keep up.
[00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:02.160]   And there's enough of that to go around. There's, again, there's no scarcity.
[00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:05.360]   Well, let me ask you all, because you guys are experts. How do you find an audience?
[00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:07.440]   Just do good work.
[00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:09.840]   Yeah, exactly. They find us.
[00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:10.400]   Yeah.
[00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:11.840]   Really, you think that that's a question?
[00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:14.560]   Well, I was lucky.
[00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:18.240]   Well, do something unique that nobody else is doing. I mean, I do something that you truly
[00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:21.440]   believe in that you can put your heart behind and be like, "This is my show that I have a vision for."
[00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:23.680]   And you're free stuff into it.
[00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:24.160]   Yeah.
[00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:24.480]   Yeah.
[00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:26.560]   I mean, the biggest question that I get asked.
[00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:28.960]   Say that again, John.
[00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:29.440]   Sorry.
[00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:30.960]   Don't try to reach.
[00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:35.600]   Like, I mean, like, we have a lot of guys saying, "Oh, I want to do a podcast and I want to do the
[00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:39.760]   next loss." And I'm like, "You can't." They have $2 million in episode. You can't beat loss.
[00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:43.120]   It's phenomenal storytelling with some of the world's best writers.
[00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:46.000]   What you can do is make something that's equally entertaining for 50 bucks.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:51.440]   What happens to big scale entertainment? George Lucas said it's the end of big budget movies.
[00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:54.080]   Well, he's one to talk. What's he spent on his books?
[00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:57.600]   He said that recently, I think.
[00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:01.680]   Star Wars 1977 and pick, "Oh, yeah, I'm still not finished."
[00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:07.040]   Will there always be room for the $100 million film and the $2 million TV show?
[00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:07.520]   You think so?
[00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:11.360]   Of course, I think Battle of Sargillabtica and Lost are some of the best shows on television.
[00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:12.960]   And I think we could never pull that off.
[00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:14.480]   They're amazing work.
[00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:19.760]   I mean, that's not a question of doing what you know. I mean, I don't want to use the word "tour"
[00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:23.920]   because it's not exactly appropriate. But you think somebody like Scorsese, who had a vision for
[00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:28.320]   what he wanted to do, and at that time in the studio system falling apart, he had the ability to
[00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:31.520]   go out and independent people together and come up with something that he really believed in.
[00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:34.080]   He got control over the final cut and he got to do what he wanted to do.
[00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:37.840]   But a lot of people blame this. A lot of people blame this on money when it's really about having
[00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:39.840]   a lack of a vision for what it is that you want to do.
[00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:46.000]   But if you slice the pie into a thousand tiny slices, is there enough money to still make the big
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.160]   blockbuster revenue?
[00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:51.440]   Well, then you get picked up. I mean, look what happens. It's already happening in film.
[00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:54.960]   Like, I mean, a lot of people get their legs in the short film and you make a short film to try
[00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:58.640]   and get notice, try and get people to see it. You take it to a short film festival, you run it,
[00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:02.560]   you cost a ton of money. This for the first time ever, we're seeing independent television,
[00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:05.520]   where you can do that for television. You have an independent audience,
[00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:08.480]   you can get your stuff out there and show it off. And if you're really, really good,
[00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:11.760]   and you have a great, great vision, you're going to get money and you're going to find people and
[00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:14.320]   you're going to go to the top. Is there going to be a lot of guys sinking to the bottom of
[00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:18.240]   mediocrity? Sure. But that's happening already in literature and television and film all over the
[00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:21.920]   place. The real competition, if there is any, is going to come, I think, from the other way.
[00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:25.680]   So right now, competition among a bunch of people who are kind of just putting stuff together and
[00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:29.120]   cobbling stuff together with no budget isn't the problem. The problem is going to be when NBC
[00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:32.960]   finally wakes up and goes, we don't want to spend hundreds of thousand dollars per broadcast
[00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:36.880]   minute. And they start throwing some of their talent at podcasting. I mean, go look at the iTunes
[00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:41.200]   charts. The stuff that consistently holds the top positions is stuff that has the market power to
[00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:45.040]   kind of push into that position. Well, and that's kind of an is an issue because, of course,
[00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:49.920]   if you have mainstream media, you can market yourself and you will get, you know, that's why
[00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:54.320]   fresh air is number one because it at the end of every fresh air broadcast, they say, and we're
[00:32:54.320 --> 00:33:01.200]   now a podcast. Don't get yourself mainstream media is feverishly aware of this new stuff.
[00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:05.760]   Like, I mean, Michael O'Lene is the head of Cartoon Network. He runs programming. Who's eating
[00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:12.480]   a snack bar? I just want to point out, this is a long form broadcast. I got a coke to
[00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:18.960]   point. It's a grapefruit. I didn't sound like a grapefruit. I go to a lot of like, you know,
[00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:23.920]   the old school or mainstream media conferences, and they're all talking about this, all trying to
[00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:26.880]   put their heads around it. And they have very, very smart people working as well. Like Michael
[00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:32.640]   O'Lene, who's one of the heads of Cartoon Network, knows more about what's on the internet than
[00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:36.320]   anybody. I mean, I listened to him do a keynote and I'm like, wow, he's dialed in. Like, he is
[00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:40.800]   incredibly in tune. So they're not just a bunch of titans sitting there saying, we make the TV
[00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:44.000]   show. I mean, they're all in the home. They've been trying to hire. No, they've been trying to hire
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:51.440]   Tiki Bar TV, the team and me for the last year. Really? Every meeting they're like, you know, but
[00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:56.960]   why don't they? How come for hire? Because this is why, because frankly, the money they're offering
[00:33:56.960 --> 00:34:02.880]   exchange for total ownership of the show and is just doesn't make any sense to me. Like, two years
[00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:08.560]   ago, when they had no, you had no opportunity to sort of own your own show and distribute it worldwide.
[00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:14.560]   Wow, even as I say that, that's pretty cool. But two years ago, he'll be like, yes, absolutely.
[00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:18.800]   Are you telling me that I can come there and make my mini TV show? And I'll be the producer and
[00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:24.560]   director of it and you'll pay me? Wow. And now, but the money that they're offering is very low
[00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:29.280]   because they know it's we're talking about dabbling in it. What if they offered you a ton of money?
[00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:38.480]   A ton of money now that it gets interesting. Well, find Tiki TV at gmail.com.
[00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:44.560]   If they offer me a ton of money, well, then we'd have to talk. So it was merely that they didn't
[00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:49.200]   offer you enough money. I mean, I'm wondering if you hear this. Well, is it really? I know I
[00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:52.720]   should classify that right now as a. I mean, how important is control to you?
[00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:58.160]   This is this conversation has played itself out in film. I mean, Jeff and I both come from live
[00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:02.000]   action and from film. And this is all over the independent live action circuit where independent
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.960]   filmmakers are like, I would never take the money. I'd never take the money. And then somebody does
[00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:09.520]   really, really well. And all of a sudden, he's made traffic. It's hard. It's hard to turn down the
[00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:15.920]   money. But you pay a price. Is it selling your soul? Sure. I would like to make a great short.
[00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:18.960]   He made a great little movie and all of a sudden he's making phenomenal work. I don't think it's
[00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:23.840]   any less. Traffic is a great film. He's a fan. I have no problem. I have no problem.
[00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:29.680]   Oh, I mean, we feel that way. I have no problem with doing a big budget show. I mean, I'd like to
[00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:36.800]   make a television show or a feature film with a good budget. I'm not interested in the offers of
[00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:46.720]   making independent internet television programs where the big network owns the show. Whereas,
[00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:50.880]   I could create it because I know the resources that I need to make the shows that I want to make.
[00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:56.720]   This is what they want to pay me to do. They will own them thinking, I'm willing to bite the bullet
[00:35:56.720 --> 00:36:02.240]   and eat a cantuna and own it outright and then decide what to do with this property once it's
[00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:06.400]   successful. Does that make sense? Yeah. You can afford to open up. I totally make sense. I mean,
[00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:11.360]   money is not a moral issue regarding money. It's really about what Jeff said is right. It's not
[00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:16.960]   only has this opened up the ability for an individual to have absolute distribution,
[00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:23.680]   but also the ownership of the intellectual property and the actual ideas that you're creating.
[00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:29.360]   And that's very empowering for an individual. And no corporation is going to be able to pull off
[00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:35.520]   that level of instinct and power that the individual can have in making their own show.
[00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:40.320]   They are going to come down. They are going to come down and they are going to start doing these
[00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:44.480]   shows. But just the very structure of the corporation and the committee decision making,
[00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:49.360]   it's not going to be, it will happen and there are going to be a lot of them, but there are still
[00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:53.520]   going to be those individuals out there making great stuff and who are thriving.
[00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:59.040]   I'm going to just have a little program note. We are in talk shoe live and we will be taking
[00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:05.280]   calls on talk shoe in just a little bit. So queue up your calls for the guys from Tiki Barred. Dr.
[00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:10.800]   Tiki is here. He's in the house. Jeff McPherson, Kevin Gamble, Johnny Johnny. Also Merlin Mann
[00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:15.680]   from the Merlin show and Craig Siverson from Podgrunt. So if you have a question for them,
[00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:21.120]   we will be taking your questions live. Also, for those of you who hate the talk shoe chat client,
[00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:30.320]   one of our listeners has set up a kind of IRC, a standard IRC client or a chat room that you
[00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:37.520]   could go into. If you're in the chat room right now, you'll see it. But it is thanks to Pyrotease,
[00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:45.120]   it is IRC.caffeine.com and the channel is pound twit.
[00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:47.280]   It's a good net caffeine net.
[00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:54.000]   You've been on it. Okay. I don't know. I just like the name. So thanks to Pyrotease for making
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:38:00.080]   that competing chat room. Anyway, we'll continue on. I'll tell you one of the things we usually
[00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:04.320]   do on Twitter is talk about news. And there is quite a bit of news. I mentioned Apple TV.
[00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:07.200]   There's quite a bit of news appropriate. Aproper Poda, this subject for instance,
[00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:15.680]   on Thursday, NBC Universal and News Corps announced a new online video network,
[00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:19.680]   they'll debut it in summer, which will feature full-length programming movies and clips from
[00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:24.720]   their own shows. But other television networks, it doesn't of them. And at least two major film
[00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:29.360]   studios, AOL, MSN and Yahoo are jumping on the bandwagon. They will be distributing.
[00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:35.440]   The big guys are here. Yeah. They're not going to just take this land down.
[00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:38.880]   Are they going to take us away from us? I mean, can we fight back?
[00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:42.640]   I think, I mean, we're not going to go away. It's going to be they can do the main line
[00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:45.520]   version of what we're doing. But it's still big, you know, lumbering.
[00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:50.400]   You know, I think, I think that, you know, it's interesting. They said that the, you know,
[00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:55.120]   the indie film scene or the independent film scene, which is now very different and quite,
[00:38:55.120 --> 00:39:00.720]   you know, dominant and competing with Hollywood studio pictures in terms of, you know,
[00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:06.160]   the attention and the quality. The reason that we have sort of interesting, independent,
[00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:10.960]   creative, low-budget films is as a result of the mainstream Hollywood films that just don't,
[00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:16.560]   they just don't fill that need. We're pushing, so we're pushing mainstream
[00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:22.160]   very hard to innovate. Yeah. I mean, it was interesting is I guess mainstream is sort of
[00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:25.760]   coming on the heels of the indie guys. I mean, they certainly are in terms of what we're doing.
[00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:28.160]   The indie guys want their shot at mainstream though. I mean, that's what independent
[00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:32.080]   short films are for. They're guys queuing up to be recognized so they can get the money to go big
[00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:37.360]   time. Like, indie film and short films is literally the farm league for Hollywood. And they're like,
[00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:41.680]   you have a vision. Like the guy who just directed 300, I forget his name, he'd done what commercials
[00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:44.720]   and stuff before. Now, I just put a film out there that's made 200 million in two weeks.
[00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:50.000]   Like, he's a phenomenal storyteller. Where did he come from? Small media, right? So that's like,
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:54.240]   is short films and doing that already for Hollywood? Hollywood is
[00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:57.920]   voracious appetite for new storytellers and new stories. I'd like to think of it as some
[00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:01.760]   pull them up. I'd like to think of it as more though than a farm league for Hollywood.
[00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:05.840]   Definitely. Yeah. I mean, it depends on what the individual wants to do, what they want to do
[00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:10.080]   with their life. I think they have a choice. You know, if you want to be a director and you want to
[00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:14.480]   be a Hollywood guy, then use this as a farm league. If you want to create your own stuff for the
[00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:19.920]   rest of your life, you do that. You know, you don't want to do the Hollywood production
[00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:27.120]   right now. And the opportunities are there right now to make that leap to not a major Hollywood movie,
[00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:32.320]   but to be working for Hollywood. Every night I'd come home and look on the internet and see
[00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:36.960]   what other people were innovating and how they were pushing this new medium and thinking,
[00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:42.320]   you know, this is only going to happen once in history. It may happen again, but this emerging
[00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:47.360]   new independent internet television, you know, whatever you want to call this. And I just,
[00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:55.200]   I want my Wikipedia entry to be big. I actually don't have one. Can someone create one for me?
[00:40:55.200 --> 00:41:00.960]   Anyway, you don't have a Wikipedia entry. Oh, neither do I. Jeff, you should both do. I
[00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:05.120]   chose to, but I don't. And I can't do it myself. It has to emerge naturally. No, that's because
[00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:10.000]   nobody knows who you are. Oh, that's why. No, Arnold Horstein has an entry.
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:17.920]   Reginald. Reginald has an entry. No, he died. Oh, does he? Jeff McPherson, M A C P H E R S O N
[00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:27.680]   small P and Kevin Gamble. That's right. G A M B A M with G and B I N G. And anyway,
[00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:32.640]   just make a Wikipedia entry for them. Would you please? Can mine start with one of the most and
[00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:36.640]   then say whatever you want or whatever else after that, right? You know, you're somebody if it's
[00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:42.240]   devilishly handsome. Thank you for British. You've already written it. It's like writing.
[00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:47.440]   Have you also written your Academy Award acceptance? Well, I'm so surprised to be up here today.
[00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:52.400]   Wait, it's the filing cabinet. Hang on. Let me get it. So Jeff, what would be your thing for
[00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:58.880]   TK bar? I mean, what would be your best wish for that right now? Tomorrow. Oh, tomorrow? Yeah,
[00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:05.600]   like, I'm sponsored. You can be successful. Yeah, sponsorships. It's sustainable for us to
[00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:11.520]   expand a bit and get more episodes out of the more frequently. And I'd like to develop the
[00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:16.480]   site and help, I guess, give the community what they're looking for, which is just a, you know,
[00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:22.880]   the site's kind of rough in places. And it's a community that really likes to socialize. And
[00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:29.520]   they're usually online every night on our chat room. Ultimately, that's important, by the way.
[00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:34.080]   And it's something that only the best network shows can even hope to aspire to a no TV,
[00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:39.360]   no movie can, which is you're creating a community. Yeah, that's new. That's different.
[00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:42.320]   Because we're small enough that we can actually email people back. I mean, we get emails and I
[00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:45.360]   write back and they're like, Oh, my goodness, you wrote back to me. And I'm like, yeah, just
[00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:48.880]   sitting in my living room. It's one of the things I just started to realize is the real power of
[00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:54.240]   Twitter. It's the Twitter army. It is a community of people. And while I don't want to sell them
[00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:59.520]   down the river, I think that's something advertisers are very will become, if they're not yet savvy
[00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:03.840]   enough, but will become very interested in it. It's also important whenever you're thinking about an
[00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:06.960]   independent thing and you start generally doing something, you don't start out with the idea that
[00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:10.320]   you're going to become a mogul. You do it because you enjoy it and you like to think you're good at it.
[00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:14.400]   But I think for anybody who's doing independent media, you've got to start by saying to yourself,
[00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:19.040]   okay, in terms of the Tiki bar, what are we, what is it we're not capable of doing right now,
[00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:23.440]   where it's really just strictly about money? What would change that? Because I think a lot of
[00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:27.680]   people, whether it's music or film or whatever, they go to these big companies thinking that's
[00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:31.760]   going to be their big brass ring. And then they just end up with a different set of problems and
[00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:35.840]   a whole new set of people to be successful. Can we all say as independent otters that this is
[00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:41.360]   really fun and we're we love this. Yes. If it wasn't fun, we wouldn't do it.
[00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:45.600]   You know, it's because we're not making any money. So we know it must be good. By the way,
[00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:51.360]   our community is working hard. Box Game X is now set up a website, caffeinenet.com/twit.
[00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:58.160]   You don't have an IRC client, you can go there, K-A-F-F-E-I-N-E-N-E-T.com. Crowdsourcing,
[00:43:58.160 --> 00:44:04.000]   you call it, right? Yes, and it's really an amazing, powerful thing that scares me in a lot of ways.
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:09.200]   Frankly, can you give that URL one more time? Yeah, actually, yeah, I'd like to invite you guys
[00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:23.600]   to go in there K-A-F-F-E-I-N-E-K-E-I-N-E-T. All1Word.com/twit. That threw me off.
[00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:35.040]   Don't put a U-F-E-N-E-T-E-N-E-T.com. There's no U-F-F-E-I-N-E-T.com. And then the nickname is...
[00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:42.240]   I think you create your own neck. You could be docked. I'm sorry. I see. It's a little coffee
[00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:48.400]   cup for caffeine net. That's clever. Oh, that's cute. This is this is... It's caffeine, like coffee
[00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:53.760]   in it. So this is but this is a really an example of how I mean, we're doing this live on on the fly
[00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:59.760]   and people are immediately... There's a community sprung up around it and ad hoc community that
[00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:05.280]   will be for this podcast. Oh, I just... Cut. I mean, I'm just Johnny, not Johnny, Johnny.
[00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:11.520]   Didn't like the space. How many people we got in this room? Okay. Yeah, and you know, that's what
[00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:17.600]   it is. The... I love it when I answer somebody on one of the social networks, Facebook or MySpace.
[00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:21.840]   You know, it's funny because I'm at the point now where people will write, "Well, how do I know this
[00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:28.000]   is the real you?" And I'm thinking, "Wow, there are people out there impersonating me."
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:32.160]   There's a room full of Dr. Teakey's to handle all of our emails. That's right.
[00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:37.520]   Only that was so. Yeah, not quite. You know, I got... I got... I like to call it my Aikido maneuver,
[00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:43.440]   but I got a particularly nasty email on everybody. You know, these things happen not very often,
[00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:48.320]   but one was, you know, I just watched a show and it sucks. You guys really think you're funny.
[00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:51.840]   You know, I'd have more fun smashing my face in dirt. I got a task, Dale.
[00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:58.720]   Funny enough. It was sent from Johnny Johnny at Teakey's email.
[00:45:58.720 --> 00:46:04.480]   On the right hand. I don't know what you're talking about. You know what I did? I've been spoofed
[00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:11.520]   again. So, Ross, what's your Aikido maneuver? My... You know, I did. I wrote them back and I just
[00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:18.080]   said, you know, they do it because it's anonymous and you don't really have to. You wouldn't say
[00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:23.040]   it to somebody's face. So, I said, what if I take that sort of anonymous aspect out of it? And so,
[00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:27.920]   I wrote them back and I said, so I read your email because that's what we do here when you
[00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:34.160]   email somebody. And I'm the guy who makes the show. And if it was your intention to hurt someone's
[00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:41.760]   feelings, well, you did. You hurt, you know. And I understand you watched this episode. And,
[00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:46.320]   frankly, it's not my favorite episode either. You might want to try these couple. They seem to be
[00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:50.880]   popular. And then I said, and here's another couple of shows that people enjoying the web. You might
[00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:57.600]   like these better. And so... And I said, it's not a big anonymous corporation. It's a couple of
[00:46:57.600 --> 00:47:02.640]   guys in their apartment. And that was it. And that's very effective. I've done that a few times,
[00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:06.400]   too. And it's very effective because you're right. They don't think they're talking to anybody.
[00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:10.160]   And I just did... The response that I got... And then type back.
[00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:18.240]   The response that I got from him was, I'm really sorry. I reread that email and I was having a
[00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:26.080]   bad day. And it turns out that he is a guy who wants to get into filmmaking. And the next thing I
[00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:32.560]   know, he's giving me a friend request on my space. There you go. So that was a really good feeling.
[00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:41.440]   But it was... Jeff Noh has a Wikipedia entry. Under that is so fast. It's terrifying.
[00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:47.520]   Yeah. And does it say he's a wuss, too? But to actually say you're confused. He's a one of the most
[00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:56.960]   wuss-like. But the part of one of the more wuss-like. And it links to my web page saying that I pwned
[00:47:56.960 --> 00:48:02.000]   you all, which is... That's nice. That's really nice. No, I think that that's actually really
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:09.040]   an important point is that people think we are just like lost and we're not.
[00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:14.640]   Yeah. I had an interesting experience. Someone did a parody of my show called Video Grump.
[00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:19.920]   And it's actually quite funny. I love that. Yeah. It's hilarious. And I really like it. And
[00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:25.200]   it's somebody... That's the highest price of all. Someone posted a comment on the show saying,
[00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:31.760]   "This is hilarious. It shows... It really paradises Craig Siverson's goals to be his Hollywood-bound
[00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:36.160]   goals." And I thought, "Wow. That's really interesting that someone would actually think
[00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:40.000]   I'd want to be in Hollywood." They know your motives, Jeff. They're crazy. Right. And it's like,
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:45.360]   that is so not what I want to do. It's almost exactly the opposite. But it does go back to this
[00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:50.880]   thing where there's this assumption that we all want to rise to the "top." And it's really...
[00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:56.160]   From a personal base, it's about Maslow's hierarchy, really, for the individual. What do you want to
[00:48:56.160 --> 00:49:01.360]   do? You want to be actualized. Yeah. What's fulfilling for you? And for me, doing this stuff,
[00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:08.400]   I could be here at the home with my family and do this on my own time. To me, that's great. I don't
[00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:14.480]   want to go down and do a $60 million movie. That's not my intention. I'll be honest here. When I got
[00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:19.040]   into broadcasting, I think I probably did want to rise to the top. I've been doing this for 30
[00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:22.640]   years, and that's the goal, right? You get to make your market. You make the big bucks, and
[00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:27.760]   you get to make your market wife. But after I did this for... That's a joke, by the way,
[00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:32.640]   that major market wife. I like it. I like it. I like it. It's smiley. Smile. Yeah.
[00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:39.040]   'Cause you have a wife who'll kill me. But... You think she's the major market leader? She is major.
[00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:44.080]   She's my major market wife. I just... Okay, there you go. I'm just checking. That's a line that DJ
[00:49:44.080 --> 00:49:47.680]   once told me, said, "Now that you're in the major markets, you need to get a major market wife."
[00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:56.640]   But now having entered this new medium, this user-generated stuff, I have to say that there is
[00:49:56.640 --> 00:50:01.760]   immensely more satisfaction in just creating it and knowing people listen to it than anything else,
[00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:06.880]   than any other goal I might have had in the past. Maybe that's one of the real valuable things
[00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:12.960]   about this, is that you can get off that rat race, off that hamster wheel, and start to appreciate
[00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:19.520]   the joy of raw creation. Right. And if I could turn that back around to the earlier point of
[00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:25.040]   the conversation about what makes the show successful for an individual, I mean, it's really about...
[00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:29.600]   To make a good show, it's about finding your own unique point, where it's something that you're
[00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:34.560]   really, really good at. If you look at the Ignatian guys, it's a static camera that's not particularly
[00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:40.000]   well lit of two guys sitting on a couch. As a treatment for a movie, that's the most boring thing in the
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:44.560]   world. I get this hat from that pitch. It's the surprise on a couch.
[00:50:44.560 --> 00:50:53.120]   The show, it's great because it's got an oux and it's just like it is a good show. You don't have to
[00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:58.160]   have high production quality. It has to be legible. I leverage high production quality,
[00:50:58.160 --> 00:51:02.720]   but you don't have to. It's really about if you just do something that's unique and good,
[00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:08.720]   I think you're going to be fine. And big media cannot even touch that ever. They can't
[00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:12.400]   forget it. The authenticity of it.
[00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:19.120]   Well, in the software world, there's this dichotomy between open source and commercial software.
[00:51:19.120 --> 00:51:22.720]   People often say, "Well, open source couldn't possibly be any good because the people aren't
[00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:29.120]   being paid to make it." The obvious counter is better because it's people who are doing it because
[00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:34.320]   they want to do it. They enjoy it. Who's going to do a better job? Somebody who's stuck in a cubicle
[00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:38.720]   12 hours a day to make a living or somebody who goes home from that cubicle and does something
[00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:44.240]   because he loves it. I'm not making a moral judgment about money. I want to make money
[00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:48.560]   and what I'm doing. I'm doing it to make money. I want to have a living with it.
[00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:54.160]   The two are completely independent. There's no code that says I can't make money in doing
[00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:58.000]   something I love. That's just bad thinking. That's so Calvinistic.
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:00.960]   No, that is bad thinking.
[00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:04.880]   But you don't do it because you want to make it. Now, have you guys watched Justin.TV?
[00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:08.880]   Anybody watched Justin? Justin.tv. I'm pulling it up right now.
[00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:17.680]   This is live broadcast. Actually, it's slowed down. So I'm going to stop it right now. This is a live
[00:52:17.680 --> 00:52:22.000]   broadcast started about a week ago. Justin's a kid has put a camera on his head and he says,
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:27.920]   "I'm not taking it off 24/7 for the rest of my life." Oh, that's not so cool.
[00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:37.120]   I'm sure he'll get a photo of her tattoo. It's going to be great. Actually, not so much.
[00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:42.320]   If you're thinking about it, the first... Like right now, he's outside in the park somewhere.
[00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:45.520]   I actually asked him to join us and he wanted to join us, but he's busy doing something else,
[00:52:45.520 --> 00:52:49.040]   but he will join us somewhere. He's hunting a network. Right now, he can't get away.
[00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:54.320]   But what's interesting is how this is spread as a meme over the internet very rapidly.
[00:52:54.320 --> 00:52:58.560]   And a lot of people are watching this and are even hooked to this the most mundane of lives.
[00:52:58.560 --> 00:53:04.480]   And frankly, I tuned in when he was peeing and it's everything.
[00:53:04.480 --> 00:53:14.240]   Now, but we shouldn't judge this. I think this is in some ways the next step of what we're talking
[00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:18.560]   about. I mean, this is talk about slice of life. I would say it's really similar to the kind of
[00:53:18.560 --> 00:53:22.880]   the webcams of the late time. It's like Jenny Cam only live. Jenny Cam, that's the one.
[00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:30.080]   Beats Ant4 Hall. Remember this? His 24 cam. 24... Yeah, well, and it is. I guess it has the same
[00:53:30.080 --> 00:53:35.760]   appeal as Jenny. Now, I don't know if Justin has a girlfriend. Speaking of... No, I don't.
[00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:42.080]   Speaking of... Sorry, Justin. I know it's a problem. I know I'm going to meet him at some point.
[00:53:42.080 --> 00:53:45.680]   He's a small community and there's one's going to see it too.
[00:53:49.120 --> 00:53:52.160]   If he has a girlfriend, she may be one of the most tolerant people on the planet.
[00:53:52.160 --> 00:53:57.600]   She's going to be part of the show too. Maybe she has her own cam and they get like different
[00:53:57.600 --> 00:54:05.840]   Google ads, but cross traffic. Speaking of porn, didn't you have... See, I'm allowed to do that
[00:54:05.840 --> 00:54:12.720]   segue because you had a story. We have a story that was in the news about... The porn... You want
[00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:17.760]   to talk about that? Child protection. Yeah, this is falling. It's again, 1998, they made this law
[00:54:18.320 --> 00:54:24.800]   to protect kids online. And once again, the judges tossed it out saying it violates free speech.
[00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:32.080]   What was the technology behind it? I mean, I understand the wording. I guess the law doesn't...
[00:54:32.080 --> 00:54:36.720]   It's the Child Online... It's a specific... A couple of... The Child Online Protection Act.
[00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:42.480]   And the judge said, "Well, I sympathize with the goal of restricting minors from seeing pornography.
[00:54:45.600 --> 00:54:50.800]   Because software filters exist, that's good enough. And you can't make a law saying that the
[00:54:50.800 --> 00:54:56.000]   web is somehow going to be safe for kids." Here's something interesting. The original law
[00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:04.480]   way back said that it was illegal to have women's breasts as well. What was the indecency is what
[00:55:04.480 --> 00:55:09.280]   it was? Indecent. But I mean, it did include... I looked it up on Wikipedia, but there's something
[00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:16.160]   about even their breasts. And of course, in some cultures, many cultures where women's breasts are
[00:55:16.160 --> 00:55:21.360]   exposed, and that's fine. There's... Well, France. It's... You know, France, but also thinking of maybe
[00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:27.280]   more African nations or something like that. It's on their money in France. Is it? They got boobs
[00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:34.080]   on their money? They got boobs on their money. Yeah. Jiminy. So tangible value. I can see the
[00:55:34.080 --> 00:55:38.880]   value in that legal tender. You know, okay, it's right on there. So... Kids trade currency? I
[00:55:38.880 --> 00:55:44.640]   trade you a 5, 4, and 5. Oh, wow. Oh, give me the 5. Check it out. That's why. Have you got
[00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:49.920]   total of the money? That's why I saw the money in the bathroom again. Eve to beg me the 10.
[00:55:49.920 --> 00:55:56.560]   Disgusting. I think about that too. You know, if I have kids, I'd like to know about it. But
[00:55:56.560 --> 00:56:05.440]   no, if I have kids in the future, they're, you know, wow, this internet thing is totally unrestricted.
[00:56:05.440 --> 00:56:09.920]   I have kids. I have a 15-year-old and a 12-year-old. How do you regulate it, Leo? How do you keep
[00:56:09.920 --> 00:56:13.280]   your kids like that? You know, it's like, have the tell of the computer in the living room and
[00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:15.440]   like, I'm going to see what you're talking about. Yeah, we have the computer in the living room.
[00:56:15.440 --> 00:56:19.200]   That's one thing that certainly helps. And I do have a filter on there, although it's
[00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:24.480]   lately disabled. What's interesting is, you know, I have Google's... You know, I sign... I have a
[00:56:24.480 --> 00:56:29.840]   Google account and I don't think the kids know this, but their search history is locked by Google
[00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:34.320]   and I can go over there. And so every once in a while, well, I'll just give you an example when I
[00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:39.840]   was in Vancouver last week, I saw that Henry had searched for boobs on the golf course.
[00:56:39.840 --> 00:56:46.000]   I don't know what he was looking for or whether he found it. I actually clicked the
[00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:50.160]   link. I'm not going to say silly, silly antics. Is that your revenge to him now? You're going to
[00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:56.160]   announce his history on the radio. That would change my behavior. Henry, everything you search for is
[00:56:56.160 --> 00:57:03.840]   known. You put it on delicious or something. But what about this crazy idea? And I'm not
[00:57:03.840 --> 00:57:11.360]   proposing that it's actually true, but in an environment where it's impossible to, you know,
[00:57:11.360 --> 00:57:18.960]   keep images of sex away from anybody and everybody just starts to be raised having seen them.
[00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:24.960]   Would that take away from the... I mean, does some of the trauma or shock of seeing sex come from the
[00:57:24.960 --> 00:57:30.320]   fact that we shield our kids from it, whereas they don't do that in all societies? I thought yes.
[00:57:30.320 --> 00:57:35.920]   I think you're right. And I hope that... I have to say though that some of the sex that you're
[00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:40.960]   seeing on the internet very easily is not... I mean, you know, I've been in countries where
[00:57:40.960 --> 00:57:46.960]   fathers and mothers will make love and the kids are in the same room or in another room and it's,
[00:57:46.960 --> 00:57:52.560]   you know, that's kind of normal culturally. But this is not what we're talking about on the
[00:57:52.560 --> 00:57:57.280]   internet. I mean, this is not stuff that anybody would normally... There's some pretty dark corners
[00:57:57.280 --> 00:58:02.160]   out there. Yeah. I think some of this stuff is extremely strong and inappropriate for kids,
[00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:05.360]   frankly. So I agree with that. But that's where software filters come in.
[00:58:05.360 --> 00:58:12.000]   Yeah. It could be a case of... It could be also a case of say, you know, a kid comes across something
[00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:19.760]   that's sort of, you know, just some of that not-cool stuff. Right. And they'll just be repelled by it.
[00:58:19.760 --> 00:58:22.960]   Well, they are repelled by it. But it's an image in the brain that you can't get rid of.
[00:58:22.960 --> 00:58:28.480]   And frankly, I think you're seeing kids in high school now do have... There are sexual
[00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:31.440]   practices that are common in high school that wouldn't have been except for the predominant
[00:58:31.440 --> 00:58:36.160]   subprenography. But aren't you also sort of impressed by a judge who at least has the awareness to go,
[00:58:36.160 --> 00:58:39.440]   "Hey, well, you know what? Actually, it's a mood issue because the filtering is better than
[00:58:39.440 --> 00:58:42.960]   anything we did." He did the right thing. Without a house ten years ago. Yeah. He clearly did the
[00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:46.400]   right thing. Actually, it has happened. It's been happening consistently since 1998.
[00:58:46.400 --> 00:58:49.440]   They've never been able to get this law enforced for these very same reasons.
[00:58:49.440 --> 00:58:53.840]   The other great thing that Judge said was that the damages to the First Amendment are far
[00:58:53.840 --> 00:58:58.400]   greater than the damages to the child. We talked about this on this week of media. I called it
[00:58:58.400 --> 00:59:03.040]   my personal hero. And not that I'm all for poor and reaching children. I have a child too.
[00:59:03.040 --> 00:59:08.000]   It's a real-going record for that. Yeah. Okay. I'm gonna get it. I'm gonna get it.
[00:59:09.120 --> 00:59:13.760]   It's really about the individual child and the parents' relationship with that child.
[00:59:13.760 --> 00:59:19.440]   My feeling is, you know, they're gonna find it no matter what. This is just evolution of our
[00:59:19.440 --> 00:59:22.640]   society. They find it at their friends' house even if I find it. They'll find their friends' house.
[00:59:22.640 --> 00:59:25.920]   Exactly. If we have 67 filters here, it's not gonna matter. And it's not like when I was a kid and
[00:59:25.920 --> 00:59:30.160]   we found the cache of playboys somewhere and we looked at that. They're always in a forest.
[00:59:30.160 --> 00:59:33.840]   They're always in a forest. They're all right. How did you know that? That's exactly what it was.
[00:59:33.840 --> 00:59:43.440]   It was under a bush. It was under a bush. It was under a bush. It was under a bush. It was
[00:59:43.440 --> 00:59:47.440]   a paper bag full of playboys. They were all, "What? How did you know that?" Yeah. I think they're
[00:59:47.440 --> 00:59:51.520]   like, "Pounds the same thing." It's the same magazine. It's like a big rail that goes from kid to kid.
[00:59:51.520 --> 00:59:57.760]   But it's true. Your job as a parent, kids are the most curious creatures in the world. And they're
[00:59:57.760 --> 01:00:01.600]   gonna find their new knowledge of new info. And your job as a parent is to guide them and say,
[01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:05.120]   "That's not cool. That's cool." And then keep that conversation open. I don't worry too much for
[01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:09.200]   my kids because I know that it's exactly the conversation. It's gonna be on the
[01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:12.640]   holo web and then it'll be streaming into the brain in two years. Well, it began, frankly,
[01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:17.760]   with VHS tapes. I mean, that's what it began, really. With that MTV, that MTV with their crazy
[01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:23.680]   hip shaking, that started it. That Elvis, gosh, Darden, he started it all. He started everything.
[01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:28.000]   We don't shake any of his new hips. They can no ship like that. A couple of times, you know,
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:31.920]   somebody wrote a couple of times that if someone will check out Tiki Barnot knowing what it is,
[01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:36.080]   or just get a clip of it, and think that it's porn I guess because it's sort of
[01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:41.040]   cheese production value. It's not even close. And stiff acting, pardon the pardon.
[01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:45.280]   Well, this is the part of the song. It's like porn without the sex.
[01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:50.480]   That's what someone said and called it. He says, "What is this? This is like porn without the sex."
[01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:56.560]   I thought that was hysterical. Or it's like, "Boos porn?" I'm like, "That's pretty funny."
[01:00:56.560 --> 01:01:01.360]   It's funny. It's fun, porn. It's fun. That's what it is.
[01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:03.680]   It's very funny. We'll change that right away.
[01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:08.720]   The number of times we've mentioned porn, this is going to be your most listened to show, isn't it?
[01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:12.160]   Yeah, just by the Google searches alone, absolutely.
[01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:16.960]   Should I play a little bit of... I'll tell you what, just for people who haven't perhaps heard
[01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:23.360]   Tiki Barnot, I could play a little bit of audio. I mean, obviously, it's not... You're not going
[01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:25.520]   to see the video, even if you have a Vipod.
[01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:32.400]   Can you screen over the audio channel on the interwebs?
[01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:36.720]   I can, but I have to figure out where. Which one... Do you want me to do red-handed or
[01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:39.120]   something a little older? What do you want me to do?
[01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:41.520]   Have you pre-screened it for naughty words?
[01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:45.760]   Oh, hey, that's a little late for that. Here we go. Here's a little bit of the beginning.
[01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:54.880]   And of course, Lala's just adorable. She's dancing around in the beginning of every show.
[01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:59.600]   This is Red Hand in the episode 20.
[01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:05.360]   Aloha. Welcome to Tiki Barn.
[01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:11.760]   Yeah, yeah, welcome to Tiki Barnot. You know, Tiki Barn T would not be possible without us.
[01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:12.960]   Because we make it.
[01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:16.480]   From time to time, we like to acknowledge that.
[01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:18.720]   I feel like a Jeff laughs at his own joke. I think that's good.
[01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:20.400]   That's good.
[01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:25.520]   You enjoy your show. I think that's good. That's a good... That's a very good sign.
[01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:28.160]   And that's the thing. It is a whole lot of fun to make it. That's how we keep doing it.
[01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:28.960]   And it's totally cool.
[01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:32.960]   One of the things we learned on the lab, which is neat. And you know, it's funny because I
[01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:38.480]   I didn't notice it until now that I know is that you do a lot of post-processing with color and so forth.
[01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:40.480]   It's very... The colors are very hot.
[01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:44.880]   And you know, I knew there was something going on, but I'm not savvy enough about video or
[01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:48.400]   movie production to know. I just knew that there was something going on. And now, of course,
[01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:50.880]   I watch it. I go... Craig figured it out. He'll see he's all onto us.
[01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:51.840]   Craig knew it, I'm sure.
[01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:52.320]   Yeah.
[01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:53.680]   Magic Bullet, right?
[01:02:53.680 --> 01:02:54.320]   Magic Bullet.
[01:02:54.320 --> 01:02:54.800]   That's right.
[01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:55.600]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:57.520]   Yeah, it looks good.
[01:02:57.520 --> 01:02:58.560]   I like it.
[01:02:58.560 --> 01:02:59.520]   Yeah, I like it.
[01:02:59.520 --> 01:03:00.080]   And that's intentionally...
[01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:01.040]   It's a long time.
[01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:05.120]   It's an aesthetic that Jeff, I think, works very hard to create visually.
[01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:07.520]   Yeah, it is.
[01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:13.840]   But when you see it, at least as a raw consumer, you may not be aware of all the work that's going
[01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:16.240]   into that. You might just think it looks like Bad Porn.
[01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:20.480]   I mean, if you look at episode one,
[01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:23.680]   without it, if you use Magic Bullet on porn, maybe it'll be cool.
[01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:25.360]   Please don't look at episode one.
[01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:27.040]   You guys say that all the time.
[01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:31.520]   In fact, it even says on the feed, "Crappy old episode, don't waste your time with this one."
[01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:34.240]   Which means I watched it first.
[01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:35.600]   No.
[01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:35.600]   No.
[01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:35.600]   No.
[01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:37.360]   What's wrong with it?
[01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:37.840]   But I've had...
[01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:41.280]   I've had people... Well, back when we started, it was the...
[01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:44.960]   You know, the only thing out there really was video blogs.
[01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:46.400]   And so it was fine to...
[01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:49.840]   All we were doing really was changing camera angles and adding a bit of music.
[01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:51.600]   This was almost exactly two years ago, by the way.
[01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:53.520]   You celebrated your second anniversary on the 15th.
[01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:54.400]   I didn't realize that.
[01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:55.040]   Yeah.
[01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:55.600]   Yeah.
[01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:56.560]   That's right.
[01:03:56.560 --> 01:03:58.400]   Should we actually take some questions at all?
[01:03:58.400 --> 01:03:59.440]   Yeah, would you like to?
[01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:00.480]   All right.
[01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:01.040]   Sure.
[01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:01.200]   Let me...
[01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:03.680]   Early Craig, you guys now have some questions?
[01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:04.800]   Well, I'm not.
[01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:08.160]   We got a massive audience who's got just dying to talk to all of you guys.
[01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:12.080]   But I have to turn some knobs here to make this all work like magic.
[01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:12.880]   So it's...
[01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:14.960]   Do not touch your dial.
[01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:18.240]   It makes something like Magic Bullet for Final Cut.
[01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:20.720]   Yeah, it's a plug for that.
[01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:21.200]   It's a plug-in.
[01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:21.760]   It's more Final Cut.
[01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:24.560]   You should do the Merlin show and they would really look more like porn.
[01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:25.200]   Oh, it's awesome.
[01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:26.720]   I also use a really neat looking.
[01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:28.880]   It's called Magic Bullet.
[01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:28.880]   If you pull it...
[01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:30.000]   I'm your plugin.
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:30.960]   Magic Bullet.
[01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:31.680]   Look, sweet.
[01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:34.080]   I'm giving you the thing.
[01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:35.600]   The magic bullet looks sweet.
[01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:37.520]   Red Giant Software.
[01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:38.080]   Yeah.
[01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:38.800]   That's it.
[01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:39.440]   Yeah.
[01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:40.480]   Merlin don't do this.
[01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:41.040]   It's awesome.
[01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:41.840]   It's pricey.
[01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:43.600]   But it's magic evaluated.
[01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:45.920]   It's like the Kies Power Tools.
[01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:47.600]   You don't need to.
[01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:48.960]   You don't need to for your show.
[01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:50.000]   You don't need a look.
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.160]   You don't think I should add some film grain and some nicks?
[01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:53.280]   Nah, not for the format you're in.
[01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:54.800]   There's only one thing, Merlin.
[01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:56.480]   I would change, and I've told you this already.
[01:04:56.480 --> 01:04:58.240]   Right at the beginning, you've got that great music.
[01:04:58.240 --> 01:05:00.240]   You're sitting there on a chair looking pensive.
[01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:01.520]   It says the Merlin show.
[01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:02.800]   You should be tapping your toe.
[01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:03.200]   That's all.
[01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:04.800]   That's the only change I would make.
[01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:06.000]   Yeah, I agree.
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:07.280]   All right, don't you go download it now.
[01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:08.080]   We've made the change.
[01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:08.560]   Sorry.
[01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:10.080]   That's done.
[01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:11.840]   Really, you can get so much done so quickly now.
[01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:13.360]   Magic toe tap.
[01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:14.240]   Yeah, it's a great plugin.
[01:05:14.240 --> 01:05:15.280]   Post toe tap.
[01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:17.440]   So we're going to take questions for the panel.
[01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:20.640]   Craig Seaberson, of course, from Video grunt, Pod grunt,
[01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:21.840]   grunt media.
[01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:24.080]   We've got Merlin Mann from the MerlinShow.com
[01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:25.120]   at 43 folders.
[01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:28.880]   Kevin Gamble, who is Johnny, Johnny, from the Tiki Room,
[01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:29.520]   Tiki Bar.
[01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:30.400]   I want to say the Tiki Room.
[01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:31.600]   It's the Tiki Bar.
[01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:33.840]   Tiki Room is the Disney ride.
[01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:34.400]   Disney Land.
[01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:35.120]   Discontinued.
[01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:36.720]   And the Tiki, Tiki, Tiki Room.
[01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:39.520]   And I want to play Devorak today, too, if I could.
[01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:40.240]   Oh, that's good.
[01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:43.680]   Craig Seaberson, AKA Devorak.org/moth.
[01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:45.920]   And Jeff McPherson, who is Dr. Tiki.
[01:05:45.920 --> 01:05:48.560]   So your questions, please, when I put you on,
[01:05:48.560 --> 01:05:51.040]   have a question for them if you don't hang up now.
[01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:54.800]   And please tell us your first name
[01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:55.280]   where you're from.
[01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:56.640]   And actually, our first caller, I know.
[01:05:56.640 --> 01:05:58.720]   It's John B. from Memphis, Tennessee.
[01:05:58.720 --> 01:06:00.800]   Hello, John B.
[01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:02.720]   Oh, let me press the button now.
[01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:03.120]   Hello.
[01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:04.560]   Go ahead, John.
[01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:05.440]   Hey, Leo.
[01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:06.320]   Thanks for having me on.
[01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:15.120]   I was wanting to know what the main cause of the long lead
[01:06:15.120 --> 01:06:16.240]   time between episodes.
[01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:18.600]   I really-- I'm not trying to say it's a problem,
[01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:21.000]   but I really do enjoy watching it.
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:26.600]   And also, I just wanted to make a comment.
[01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:30.320]   At the end of the episode where you guys show the recipe,
[01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:31.800]   what means some friends of mine started
[01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:34.480]   doing a few weeks ago is we'll all come over
[01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:38.240]   and watch the episode and when you guys show the recipe,
[01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:40.160]   we'll pause it, make the drink for everybody.
[01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:42.600]   And then when we're done drinking, the drink.
[01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:45.360]   I was going to ask, is there a Tiki bar drinking game?
[01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:47.320]   But I guess you don't really need one, do you?
[01:06:47.320 --> 01:06:49.960]   The whole show is a drinking game.
[01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:51.680]   Why the long-- that's probably the complaint
[01:06:51.680 --> 01:06:53.720]   you hear the most, which isn't a way good.
[01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:55.800]   We want more.
[01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:56.440]   Yeah.
[01:06:56.440 --> 01:06:57.600]   Why the long--
[01:06:57.600 --> 01:06:58.240]   It's what you're going to have.
[01:06:58.240 --> 01:07:00.560]   Last one you did was November 30th.
[01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:04.360]   Yeah, that was a long, long time ago.
[01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:07.360]   You say the dogs stole our next episode.
[01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:08.720]   I've heard rumors that--
[01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:11.920]   It's on your Wikipedia article that you're dead.
[01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:13.680]   Oh, really?
[01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:15.480]   One of the most dead.
[01:07:15.480 --> 01:07:16.880]   One of the most dead.
[01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:17.880]   One of the most dead.
[01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:18.880]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:20.920]   On the internet today.
[01:07:20.920 --> 01:07:26.440]   Basically, we both got heavily involved in other projects.
[01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:28.920]   And I was doing an incredible amount of traveling.
[01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:33.840]   And we have now, I think, three episodes in post-production
[01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:34.840]   in editing.
[01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:36.040]   Oh, that's goodness.
[01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:37.040]   And--
[01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:38.760]   That are in the can that were.
[01:07:38.760 --> 01:07:39.760]   In the can.
[01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:43.000]   How many days do you work on these in edit?
[01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:44.640]   It takes a very long time.
[01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:47.000]   It takes too long if I were to actually figure it out.
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:50.120]   I was thinking about this music video in, I think,
[01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:54.640]   "Drinkbot," where I'm singing this song--
[01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:55.560]   I love "Drinkbot."
[01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:57.360]   Whatever that song is, I can never
[01:07:57.360 --> 01:07:59.200]   run with a song that's an air and an air and an anvil song
[01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:00.440]   or something.
[01:08:00.440 --> 01:08:03.280]   And in just that music video was like a full day
[01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:04.280]   of editing.
[01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:05.960]   And I think that's just like a 20 second thing,
[01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:08.320]   probably because I'm such a slow editor.
[01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:10.800]   It takes a lot longer when you have an incredible amount
[01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:14.000]   of footage that is like five hours that has no script
[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:15.880]   and is totally improvised.
[01:08:15.880 --> 01:08:20.400]   And we're trying to manufacture something really weird,
[01:08:20.400 --> 01:08:23.880]   wacky, unpredictable, and cut it down to five minutes.
[01:08:23.880 --> 01:08:25.480]   And especially me because I go over--
[01:08:25.480 --> 01:08:29.400]   I want to familiarize myself with every shot and every piece
[01:08:29.400 --> 01:08:29.920]   of footage.
[01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:31.480]   The camera is sometimes running.
[01:08:31.480 --> 01:08:32.960]   So that's the other thing is improvised.
[01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:34.480]   So we'll be hopping all over a take.
[01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:36.760]   And it's just bins and bins and bins of footage.
[01:08:36.760 --> 01:08:39.200]   And I mean, poor Jeff has to go and make heads or tails of it
[01:08:39.200 --> 01:08:40.040]   all.
[01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:41.200]   But I've found that when it worked--
[01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:43.320]   Do you guys shoot multiple takes of each one?
[01:08:43.320 --> 01:08:44.560]   You try to catch up several times?
[01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:45.880]   We just keep rolling until it gets something
[01:08:45.880 --> 01:08:46.600]   flush in the way.
[01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:47.960]   Yeah, I don't have a script.
[01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:49.720]   You have a concept.
[01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:50.960]   Yeah, we have a concept.
[01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:53.360]   Some of them have a bit more fleshed out than others.
[01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:56.320]   There'll be five or six notes on a piece of paper.
[01:08:56.320 --> 01:08:57.800]   That's about what we go for.
[01:08:57.800 --> 01:09:00.640]   We understand what the problem is going to be
[01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:03.640]   and how we're going to solve it, which is by a cocktail.
[01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:05.800]   Sometimes we only name the drink.
[01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:10.280]   We only name the drink after the episode's been completely
[01:09:10.280 --> 01:09:13.400]   edited sometimes because we don't really
[01:09:13.400 --> 01:09:15.160]   know what this thing is.
[01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:18.360]   So are you making the drink up completely?
[01:09:18.360 --> 01:09:20.840]   I have a lot of cocktail books here that I pull drinks from.
[01:09:20.840 --> 01:09:23.600]   And then we try and find something that works for the scene.
[01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:26.640]   And then we augment and modify.
[01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:28.360]   Some are original creations.
[01:09:28.360 --> 01:09:30.360]   People say, in fact, the first time I saw it, I thought,
[01:09:30.360 --> 01:09:31.360]   boy, absolute vodka.
[01:09:31.360 --> 01:09:33.440]   It's a natural sponsor for this.
[01:09:33.440 --> 01:09:36.000]   But that's actually not the case, is it?
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:36.360]   No.
[01:09:36.360 --> 01:09:38.240]   Well, Lexus actually has absolute--
[01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:41.960]   it's the bumper sticker, but I don't have a Lexus.
[01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:42.640]   It is not the case.
[01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:46.640]   No, there was an internet rumor and it's still a pesky old press
[01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:51.240]   release hanging around the web that said that we were sponsored
[01:09:51.240 --> 01:09:52.040]   by liquor companies.
[01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:53.120]   But that's not the case.
[01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:56.480]   We are, however, in talks with one right now.
[01:09:56.480 --> 01:09:58.800]   Partly it's because of the way you treat drinking.
[01:09:58.800 --> 01:10:00.280]   The liquor companies would like to pretend
[01:10:00.280 --> 01:10:01.640]   that people don't drink.
[01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:04.800]   Yeah, you're not allowed to be drunk on booze.
[01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:07.600]   There's an American association of--
[01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:11.800]   I don't know, distillers has a self-regulating body
[01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:17.280]   that just says don't associate liquor with drunkenness.
[01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:19.880]   That's literally what the wording says.
[01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:21.960]   But it's an elective thing.
[01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:23.800]   And I think people have a company.
[01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:25.960]   And you're not drinking a number.
[01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:28.800]   I would think that at least maybe the--
[01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:30.600]   I don't know, the paper umbrella industry
[01:10:30.600 --> 01:10:31.360]   would want to buy in.
[01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:32.840]   Somebody.
[01:10:32.840 --> 01:10:33.400]   Yeah.
[01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:34.720]   No, there are different ones.
[01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:38.640]   We're working with Tiki Farm right now, who
[01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:39.720]   are a really cool company.
[01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:43.160]   I think they're the royal Dalton of Tiki Mugs.
[01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:46.720]   I don't actually know if the royal Dalton is the famous
[01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:47.680]   figurine maker.
[01:10:47.680 --> 01:10:48.320]   The Wedgewood.
[01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:49.480]   The Wedgewood.
[01:10:49.480 --> 01:10:50.160]   Yeah.
[01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:50.760]   OK.
[01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:53.680]   And so we have some really cool stuff.
[01:10:53.680 --> 01:10:55.520]   We have some custom mugs you're going to make.
[01:10:55.520 --> 01:11:00.400]   The Tiki mug of death that Lala picked on that episode.
[01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:03.120]   We're actually selling it right now.
[01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:04.720]   Oh, I want the FITIKI store.
[01:11:04.720 --> 01:11:07.200]   Hey, we got our first tip today, by the way.
[01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:10.000]   I took your advice and set up a PayPal tip jar.
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:11.120]   Good.
[01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:12.560]   And people do want to give.
[01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:13.160]   And we got--
[01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:13.160]   Yeah.
[01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:14.400]   Someone gave 40 bucks.
[01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:15.000]   How do you do?
[01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:15.840]   I would do that.
[01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:17.600]   I would do that in a minute.
[01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:19.240]   You're asking me to do that.
[01:11:19.240 --> 01:11:19.880]   Yeah, I should do that.
[01:11:19.880 --> 01:11:21.320]   No, we did that on Twitter from day one,
[01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:22.520]   because we had fixed costs.
[01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:23.400]   We had no advertisers.
[01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:25.080]   We still, you know, advertising is very spotty.
[01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:26.800]   But we have fixed costs that we have to pay.
[01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:29.560]   And people are very generous.
[01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:30.080]   Yeah.
[01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:32.800]   People are willing to support what you do.
[01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:35.480]   Do you finally, or that when you ask for gratuities,
[01:11:35.480 --> 01:11:37.680]   that people expect you to deliver on a regular basis,
[01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:38.400]   is it an increase in--
[01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:39.240]   You know, it's funny.
[01:11:39.240 --> 01:11:39.760]   Yes.
[01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:40.320]   Yes.
[01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:41.720]   And that may be an issue for you guys.
[01:11:41.720 --> 01:11:43.480]   I mean, one of the things that happens--
[01:11:43.480 --> 01:11:45.600]   we started off-- I want to make it a very low amount,
[01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:46.840]   but I wanted to make it a month-loom out,
[01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:49.520]   because my bill's coming in monthly.
[01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:51.240]   So I made $2 a month.
[01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:52.960]   And it's funny how many people think
[01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:54.680]   that for that $2 a month, they now
[01:11:54.680 --> 01:11:57.280]   are-- they have literally-- in fact, one guy put a post saying,
[01:11:57.280 --> 01:11:58.760]   well, now that I'm a shareholder in Twitter,
[01:11:58.760 --> 01:12:00.640]   I'd like to see your financials.
[01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:02.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:04.160]   And he was serious.
[01:12:04.160 --> 01:12:04.960]   No.
[01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:07.600]   No, no, he was serious.
[01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:09.320]   I mean, there's some interesting people out there,
[01:12:09.320 --> 01:12:10.360]   obviously, not ever.
[01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:12.880]   Most people know better than that.
[01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:15.480]   But yeah, there is a sense that once you are contributing
[01:12:15.480 --> 01:12:17.760]   to something that we owe you something.
[01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:19.600]   But I've always felt we owe the audience something.
[01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:21.440]   I don't know what it is, but--
[01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:24.120]   Leo, what's your take on advertising on Twitter now,
[01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:25.600]   these days?
[01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:26.440]   Are you still into it?
[01:12:26.440 --> 01:12:26.920]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:26.920 --> 01:12:27.200]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:28.600]   We have an agency working very hard.
[01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:31.240]   In fact, we will always--
[01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:34.280]   I mean, we'll always keep it to at most two commercials
[01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:35.240]   per podcast.
[01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:37.680]   They'll always be delivered by me, not interstitial,
[01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:40.160]   because I don't want to break away from the feeling
[01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:41.480]   of the podcast.
[01:12:41.480 --> 01:12:43.000]   And they're more effective that way, frankly.
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:46.640]   And so far, Podtrack, who does our metrics
[01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:48.880]   and does the pitching, it's been hard,
[01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:51.160]   because you have to convince agencies that there is such a thing
[01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:53.960]   as a podcast, and then that there is some merit in it.
[01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:56.800]   But what Podtrack has done-- and I'm to their credit,
[01:12:56.800 --> 01:12:59.520]   I know you all know Mark McCrory and Podtrack is--
[01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:00.000]   Yes.
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:01.760]   They've done a lot of research.
[01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:02.800]   We've helped them quite a bit.
[01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:06.280]   We did a survey after one of our big campaigns, a survey
[01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:09.520]   which they distilled down and delivered to the--
[01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:10.640]   if you'll forgive the phrase, it's
[01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:14.040]   still delivered to the company.
[01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:16.040]   And the company on the basis of that
[01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:18.480]   has committed to podcast advertising
[01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:20.640]   for all its products going forward.
[01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:22.440]   I believe that what's going to happen
[01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:27.040]   is that people are going to realize how valuable this podcast stuff is,
[01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:29.600]   this audience's video or audio.
[01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:32.920]   And I think in a year, you will see a significant amount of money
[01:13:32.920 --> 01:13:35.640]   shifted from mainstream media to podcast.
[01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:37.360]   That's a prediction.
[01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:39.560]   And I told you guys, the Tiki Bar guys,
[01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:41.760]   this when we were talking to Vancouver,
[01:13:41.760 --> 01:13:44.480]   if you can hang in for another year,
[01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:47.640]   I think this is all about to turn in a big way.
[01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:49.120]   And again, we're not here to make money.
[01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:50.640]   We just want to make it work.
[01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:52.920]   It's all we've been talking about convergence for so long.
[01:13:52.920 --> 01:13:53.720]   Everything's converging.
[01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:56.560]   And I think now we have devices where everything is converging
[01:13:56.560 --> 01:13:59.360]   too, that things are going to open up.
[01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:01.640]   I think the Apple iPhone is really going to change a lot of things.
[01:14:01.640 --> 01:14:02.480]   Well, an Apple TV.
[01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:02.960]   Don't you think--
[01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:03.840]   The device where everything goes.
[01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:05.360]   Yeah, the Apple TV is a great step in the right direction.
[01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:07.200]   The guy who's buying ads is going to say, hey,
[01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:09.480]   there's one channel here that has no ads.
[01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:10.760]   It's this podcast channel.
[01:14:10.760 --> 01:14:12.320]   Why aren't we on there?
[01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:14.880]   And what's the Xbox's new version, the Elite, that's coming out
[01:14:14.880 --> 01:14:17.080]   with television built right in or something like that?
[01:14:17.080 --> 01:14:18.240]   I mean, it's all going there.
[01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:18.960]   It's all getting there.
[01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:21.080]   Eventually, it's going to be just the box.
[01:14:21.080 --> 01:14:24.240]   And the box is everything from email to video to phones to movies.
[01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:25.600]   And that's all going towards.
[01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:27.920]   We're all content going towards the box.
[01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:28.440]   Yep.
[01:14:28.440 --> 01:14:29.600]   Let's take TalkTek.
[01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:31.600]   TalkTek, what's your real name and first name
[01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:34.360]   and where are you calling from?
[01:14:34.360 --> 01:14:35.280]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:36.480]   The button didn't take.
[01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:37.640]   Hold on, TalkTek.
[01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:38.680]   Oh, I'm pressing the wrong mouse.
[01:14:38.680 --> 01:14:38.960]   Hold on.
[01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:40.440]   I got too many mice.
[01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:41.960]   Go ahead, TalkTek.
[01:14:41.960 --> 01:14:43.240]   Mises.
[01:14:43.240 --> 01:14:45.280]   This is Joe from Oxford, Illinois.
[01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:46.560]   Hi, Joe.
[01:14:46.560 --> 01:14:51.000]   I got one comment of the--
[01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.920]   when it comes to kids accessing porn on the internet,
[01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:56.760]   there is a really easy solution for that.
[01:14:56.760 --> 01:15:01.160]   And that is to add a record.
[01:15:01.160 --> 01:15:03.280]   Or keeps all the domain information.
[01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:07.160]   Is this website have pornography in it?
[01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:08.640]   Let's just have--
[01:15:08.640 --> 01:15:11.120]   You mean make pornographers do that?
[01:15:11.120 --> 01:15:11.640]   Yes.
[01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:12.360]   You make it require--
[01:15:12.360 --> 01:15:13.920]   That's the idea of the XXX domain.
[01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:16.800]   The problem is how do you require--
[01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:18.680]   I mean, you can have a XXX domain,
[01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:21.600]   but how do you require people to put themselves there?
[01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:24.920]   And does Playboy go willingly?
[01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:26.240]   I don't think so.
[01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:28.160]   Does Playboy going to say we're adult?
[01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:29.120]   Well, Playboy probably will.
[01:15:29.120 --> 01:15:31.240]   They're reputable corporation.
[01:15:31.240 --> 01:15:32.680]   I don't think Playboy has given up
[01:15:32.680 --> 01:15:34.160]   that dot com address anytime soon.
[01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:37.560]   And I'd be very surprised if they allow anybody to put
[01:15:37.560 --> 01:15:40.200]   anything in their DNS records saying--
[01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:41.640]   But they will probably self-regulate
[01:15:41.640 --> 01:15:42.840]   as opposed to the shady year guy--
[01:15:42.840 --> 01:15:43.560]   Well, I would hope so.
[01:15:43.560 --> 01:15:45.480]   I've got some sort of thing going on.
[01:15:45.480 --> 01:15:47.440]   I mean, there's home solutions you can do for that.
[01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:48.840]   It's like I still in your basement, Kevin.
[01:15:48.840 --> 01:15:49.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:52.400]   That's really irritating.
[01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:56.560]   Rachel, welcome to Twitch.
[01:15:56.560 --> 01:15:57.600]   I guess your first name is Rachel.
[01:15:57.600 --> 01:15:59.200]   Where are you calling from?
[01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:00.960]   I'm calling from La Crosse, Wisconsin.
[01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:01.840]   Hi, Rachel.
[01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:03.320]   Hi.
[01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:05.600]   My question is, I'm actually really nervous
[01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:06.640]   that I drive the sounds.
[01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:07.120]   Wait a minute.
[01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:10.440]   Do you're acting like this is like a real radio show or something?
[01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:11.760]   Nothing to be nervous about.
[01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:13.200]   It's just us people talking.
[01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:14.960]   It's a couple of hours of your phone call.
[01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:17.240]   Yeah, all four of all internet is listening.
[01:16:17.240 --> 01:16:19.320]   I know how many people listen to this show.
[01:16:19.320 --> 01:16:20.320]   I have reason to be nervous.
[01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:21.360]   No, no.
[01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:22.400]   Yes, you do.
[01:16:22.400 --> 01:16:24.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:16:24.600 --> 01:16:25.520]   All right, my question.
[01:16:25.520 --> 01:16:26.000]   My question.
[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:26.640]   Be afraid.
[01:16:26.640 --> 01:16:27.920]   Be very afraid.
[01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:30.160]   Do you have a prescription, Dr. Teakey?
[01:16:30.160 --> 01:16:32.240]   I do.
[01:16:32.240 --> 01:16:34.520]   Don't think about the thousands of people
[01:16:34.520 --> 01:16:36.640]   in the world who can hear this.
[01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:38.000]   And the fact that it's being recorded
[01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:41.560]   and will be available forever in the archives.
[01:16:41.560 --> 01:16:42.480]   Oh, that's nice.
[01:16:42.480 --> 01:16:43.480]   That's just terrible.
[01:16:43.480 --> 01:16:46.760]   I can sip of this drink for girl boy.
[01:16:46.760 --> 01:16:47.760]   Go ahead, Rachel.
[01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:49.080]   Just ignore the boys.
[01:16:49.080 --> 01:16:51.720]   They're just being boys.
[01:16:51.720 --> 01:16:55.120]   As a small podcaster, I started out with about 11 downloads
[01:16:55.120 --> 01:16:57.360]   my first week, and now I get almost 700.
[01:16:57.360 --> 01:16:59.320]   Isn't that feel good?
[01:16:59.320 --> 01:16:59.720]   I know.
[01:16:59.720 --> 01:17:02.040]   I'm excited about it, but I'm starting to get spanned.
[01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:02.520]   Email us.
[01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:04.440]   Sort of freaking me out a little bit.
[01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:07.920]   So how do you get past the freaking out phase?
[01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:09.440]   Welcome to my world.
[01:17:09.440 --> 01:17:10.680]   It's my question.
[01:17:10.680 --> 01:17:14.280]   I could--
[01:17:14.280 --> 01:17:17.960]   At first, I was concerned, and I went crazy making sure
[01:17:17.960 --> 01:17:21.440]   that the Teakey Bar's address was no longer on the internet,
[01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:23.880]   and it was for a while.
[01:17:23.880 --> 01:17:25.280]   Yeah, thanks to me.
[01:17:25.280 --> 01:17:26.480]   It was right disturbed.
[01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:28.880]   I mean, the actual address of your home?
[01:17:28.880 --> 01:17:30.040]   Yeah.
[01:17:30.040 --> 01:17:32.480]   And as a Teakey Bar, because it was the registered domain--
[01:17:32.480 --> 01:17:35.800]   That's why I actually physically move every few years.
[01:17:35.800 --> 01:17:36.880]   Oh, yeah.
[01:17:36.880 --> 01:17:38.760]   Well, I had old party invites, too.
[01:17:38.760 --> 01:17:39.880]   Come on over.
[01:17:39.880 --> 01:17:41.320]   Oh, Teakey Bar--
[01:17:41.320 --> 01:17:42.480]   I mean, I had a--
[01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:44.280]   I had a blog before they were called blogs.
[01:17:44.280 --> 01:17:45.920]   It was just a web page because nobody had a place
[01:17:45.920 --> 01:17:46.640]   to put their photos.
[01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:50.480]   And so we've had to go back through that delete references
[01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:52.480]   to where the physical location of the Teakey Bar actually is.
[01:17:52.480 --> 01:17:54.720]   I have to say, though, it's a little harder for a man than it
[01:17:54.720 --> 01:17:56.320]   is for a man.
[01:17:56.320 --> 01:17:58.480]   I mean, if law law has a lot more at risk
[01:17:58.480 --> 01:18:02.200]   than you guys or I do.
[01:18:02.200 --> 01:18:05.040]   I guess how I dealt with it was that at first,
[01:18:05.040 --> 01:18:08.480]   it was a little strange, and I was concerned no one could
[01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:12.040]   find me or just be weird or obsessive.
[01:18:12.040 --> 01:18:15.640]   And then I realized over time that really it was OK.
[01:18:15.640 --> 01:18:18.160]   Nothing's really going to happen.
[01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:21.440]   If I go to a public event, I just make sure that--
[01:18:21.440 --> 01:18:23.120]   the one thing that I do make sure of
[01:18:23.120 --> 01:18:26.000]   is that it's easy to be socializing at a public event,
[01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:27.680]   and you become very friendly with everybody.
[01:18:27.680 --> 01:18:30.080]   And if someone is maybe weird or obsessive
[01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:32.280]   and wants to be your phone number and be invited over
[01:18:32.280 --> 01:18:35.640]   to your house, in those situations,
[01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:36.880]   they may act--
[01:18:36.880 --> 01:18:39.320]   and this might start freaking people out-- but they may act
[01:18:39.320 --> 01:18:42.080]   as though they don't really know the show.
[01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:44.440]   They're a real fan, and they're hiding information
[01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:46.320]   that they're a super fan.
[01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:48.440]   And then an hour into the conversation
[01:18:48.440 --> 01:18:51.160]   when they say, so what do you do for a living?
[01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:53.400]   And I go, oh, I do this show.
[01:18:53.400 --> 01:18:57.640]   And then they go, in episode 13, when you turn to the camera,
[01:18:57.640 --> 01:19:01.800]   and then I'm like, you slide off.
[01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:04.240]   I prefer it when someone lets me right away.
[01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:05.520]   They're a big fan.
[01:19:05.520 --> 01:19:08.440]   We do work really hard, and it's fine to watch
[01:19:08.440 --> 01:19:09.840]   an episode 10 times.
[01:19:09.840 --> 01:19:12.880]   It's like, great, I watch it 600 times before I podcast it
[01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:14.000]   while editing.
[01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:17.280]   Sometimes people are apologetic, stopping me on the street,
[01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:19.280]   which doesn't happen that often, but when it does.
[01:19:19.280 --> 01:19:21.000]   And I always say, thank you for stopping me.
[01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:21.920]   I appreciate it.
[01:19:21.920 --> 01:19:23.400]   Right.
[01:19:23.400 --> 01:19:25.280]   Yeah, Leo, you would know more about it.
[01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:26.640]   How do you deal with it?
[01:19:26.640 --> 01:19:29.120]   It's weird at first, and then you just do it.
[01:19:29.120 --> 01:19:31.240]   That's the hardest thing, psychologically.
[01:19:31.240 --> 01:19:33.000]   I don't think it's particularly risky.
[01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:33.760]   I mean, who knows?
[01:19:33.760 --> 01:19:36.960]   I mean, there's always the Mark David Chapman's of the world
[01:19:36.960 --> 01:19:38.400]   who are creeps.
[01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:43.120]   But the audience that we get, and I include all of us here,
[01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:48.120]   is a smart, normal, for the most part, normal audience.
[01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:48.560]   They're fine.
[01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:49.960]   They're very nice.
[01:19:49.960 --> 01:19:50.720]   Merlin, you must have it.
[01:19:50.720 --> 01:19:52.000]   I'm sure you have the same experience.
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:53.520]   They're good people.
[01:19:53.520 --> 01:19:55.440]   No, I don't know, anywhere near the level of the scale
[01:19:55.440 --> 01:19:56.320]   that you guys have.
[01:19:56.320 --> 01:19:57.840]   What's weird, I'll tell you what's weird,
[01:19:57.840 --> 01:20:02.360]   is more of the personal sense of putting yourself out there.
[01:20:02.360 --> 01:20:03.840]   And I'm really--
[01:20:03.840 --> 01:20:05.680]   I mostly got to say, I mean, whatever.
[01:20:05.680 --> 01:20:07.200]   I just want to know what this says about me.
[01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:09.280]   But I think it's-- sometimes it's really nice.
[01:20:09.280 --> 01:20:11.080]   I mean, it's nice to put something out there.
[01:20:11.080 --> 01:20:12.320]   I think it's awesome.
[01:20:12.320 --> 01:20:13.840]   And have people-- well, no, but I mean,
[01:20:13.840 --> 01:20:15.720]   there's a difference in scale, too, though.
[01:20:15.720 --> 01:20:17.560]   If you guys have ever spent any time with Leo,
[01:20:17.560 --> 01:20:19.560]   it's a little freaky.
[01:20:19.560 --> 01:20:21.920]   Going some back world with you is pretty weird.
[01:20:21.920 --> 01:20:23.640]   Well, it's not like Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[01:20:23.640 --> 01:20:25.280]   I mean, I can eat in restaurants.
[01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:26.360]   I can go grocery shopping.
[01:20:26.360 --> 01:20:27.840]   I mean, there are people who are so famous
[01:20:27.840 --> 01:20:28.680]   they can't have a life.
[01:20:28.680 --> 01:20:29.680]   But that's-- you know, actually,
[01:20:29.680 --> 01:20:31.040]   we're not bringing up a really good point, though.
[01:20:31.040 --> 01:20:31.560]   No.
[01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:34.560]   Which is-- I mean, so also part of this larger discussion, though,
[01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:36.880]   of what, in terms of like, OK, hey, I want to make it big.
[01:20:36.880 --> 01:20:38.400]   I want to be capital B big.
[01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:40.960]   Will you give so much away of your life?
[01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:41.600]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:20:41.600 --> 01:20:43.400]   Do you really-- because you can't really put that toothpaste
[01:20:43.400 --> 01:20:44.320]   back in the tube.
[01:20:44.320 --> 01:20:46.000]   And personally, I'm not worried about that.
[01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:47.600]   I don't think I'm ever going to-- I don't want to be.
[01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:49.360]   And I don't think I ever would be anywhere near that level.
[01:20:49.360 --> 01:20:50.920]   But you know, you got to be careful.
[01:20:50.920 --> 01:20:53.240]   It's really-- you can find yourself accidentally
[01:20:53.240 --> 01:20:54.360]   a lot better known than you--
[01:20:54.360 --> 01:20:56.000]   I've had some wonderful experiences.
[01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.080]   You know, Patrick Norton and I have
[01:20:58.080 --> 01:21:01.280]   driven up in a limousine to a mall where there are 2,000 people
[01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:02.480]   waiting for our autographs.
[01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:04.920]   And that's an amazing experience.
[01:21:04.920 --> 01:21:05.560]   That's wild.
[01:21:05.560 --> 01:21:06.120]   And--
[01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:07.560]   Did they think it was the anti-virus guy?
[01:21:07.560 --> 01:21:10.200]   Yeah, they thought it was saying that.
[01:21:10.200 --> 01:21:10.720]   No, no.
[01:21:10.720 --> 01:21:13.080]   It was-- it's pretty-- yeah, it was--
[01:21:13.080 --> 01:21:14.640]   I got Peter Norton with me in the car.
[01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:15.160]   I love you.
[01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:15.660]   I love you.
[01:21:15.660 --> 01:21:18.320]   You're utilities.
[01:21:18.320 --> 01:21:21.000]   Now, that guy probably gets a lot of weird autograph requests.
[01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:21.640]   I got to say it.
[01:21:21.640 --> 01:21:22.080]   The guy with the--
[01:21:22.080 --> 01:21:22.840]   Wide tie.
[01:21:22.840 --> 01:21:24.400]   Yeah, with the folded arms and wide tie.
[01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:25.200]   He's a real person.
[01:21:25.200 --> 01:21:27.080]   He's actually a billionaire.
[01:21:27.080 --> 01:21:28.880]   But that's not a story for another day, kids.
[01:21:28.880 --> 01:21:30.240]   It seems like a whole--
[01:21:30.240 --> 01:21:32.000]   I don't know what is-- like a wholesome kind of--
[01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:33.640]   I don't know what to use word fame.
[01:21:33.640 --> 01:21:35.840]   But where it's sort of genuine.
[01:21:35.840 --> 01:21:38.680]   It's not the sort of unapproachable adoration.
[01:21:38.680 --> 01:21:40.280]   It's-- there's a--
[01:21:40.280 --> 01:21:41.280]   They think you're their buddy.
[01:21:41.280 --> 01:21:42.440]   They've seen you photographed.
[01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:42.800]   Yeah.
[01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:44.760]   But that's-- we can call it that because we're so small
[01:21:44.760 --> 01:21:46.320]   and we can take the time to get to know people.
[01:21:46.320 --> 01:21:47.160]   I go to Comic-Con.
[01:21:47.160 --> 01:21:49.440]   I'm like-- I was saying that story about getting all those
[01:21:49.440 --> 01:21:50.760]   shooters buffed me that one night.
[01:21:50.760 --> 01:21:53.040]   And then the next day, I was supposed to meet one of our fans
[01:21:53.040 --> 01:21:55.000]   sent me an email saying, hey, I'd love to get a picture with you.
[01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:56.120]   And I'm like, you bet.
[01:21:56.120 --> 01:21:57.640]   Let's meet up at this booth and we'll get a picture
[01:21:57.640 --> 01:21:58.360]   and be totally fun.
[01:21:58.360 --> 01:22:00.520]   And I was so hungover that I missed the appointment.
[01:22:00.520 --> 01:22:02.440]   I actively chased her down and then took her off
[01:22:02.440 --> 01:22:04.120]   for a coffee and a cookie.
[01:22:04.120 --> 01:22:05.560]   Now she's scared of you.
[01:22:05.560 --> 01:22:07.120]   I was so sure I'm legit hanging.
[01:22:07.120 --> 01:22:07.760]   But even like--
[01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:08.840]   I like your hair that way.
[01:22:08.840 --> 01:22:10.840]   We're not super stoked.
[01:22:10.840 --> 01:22:11.960]   No, I think so.
[01:22:11.960 --> 01:22:12.440]   To really--
[01:22:12.440 --> 01:22:15.080]   That's what makes our-- makes us-- that gives us that edge
[01:22:15.080 --> 01:22:16.720]   because we're approachable and we're not--
[01:22:16.720 --> 01:22:17.720]   Right.
[01:22:17.720 --> 01:22:19.480]   But to address really what Rachel, I think,
[01:22:19.480 --> 01:22:23.640]   is really asking, which is there is a psychological barrier
[01:22:23.640 --> 01:22:27.600]   that you have to cross to be a performer where you say, OK,
[01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:31.800]   I'm going to make myself personally available.
[01:22:31.800 --> 01:22:33.680]   That is a very difficult barrier to cross.
[01:22:33.680 --> 01:22:35.280]   In fact, a lot of performers don't cross it
[01:22:35.280 --> 01:22:36.800]   and are not successful.
[01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:38.200]   I remember the first time--
[01:22:38.200 --> 01:22:39.720]   I blogged it with pictures.
[01:22:39.720 --> 01:22:42.240]   Well, the first time I blogged, I thought, this is creepy.
[01:22:42.240 --> 01:22:46.840]   I'm talking about my life in front of this audience.
[01:22:46.840 --> 01:22:47.360]   It's creepy.
[01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:48.680]   It feels wrong.
[01:22:48.680 --> 01:22:50.840]   And I think there is a natural aversion to this
[01:22:50.840 --> 01:22:52.840]   that you have to overcome to be a performer.
[01:22:52.840 --> 01:22:55.240]   There's always people who don't get that or need that.
[01:22:55.240 --> 01:22:56.440]   We're like, they just say everything.
[01:22:56.440 --> 01:22:56.840]   That's a different thing.
[01:22:56.840 --> 01:22:57.720]   You're like, oh, hang on.
[01:22:57.720 --> 01:22:58.720]   The whole world's reading this.
[01:22:58.720 --> 01:23:02.080]   You need to not type that so much.
[01:23:02.080 --> 01:23:04.160]   So it is psychologically difficult.
[01:23:04.160 --> 01:23:07.520]   And it can be rewarding, but it kind of
[01:23:07.520 --> 01:23:09.400]   makes you a little queasy, I think, too.
[01:23:09.400 --> 01:23:11.360]   I know how Rachel's feeling, frankly,
[01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:13.920]   because it is a difficult thing to do.
[01:23:13.920 --> 01:23:17.720]   If she's still on, can you get all of her personal information?
[01:23:17.720 --> 01:23:19.360]   It's already on the works.
[01:23:19.360 --> 01:23:20.240]   It's in the IRC channel.
[01:23:20.240 --> 01:23:21.520]   We should all totally contact her.
[01:23:21.520 --> 01:23:23.440]   Did we get to the Rachel promoter at your show?
[01:23:23.440 --> 01:23:24.960]   Did she mention the fact that I was on the work?
[01:23:24.960 --> 01:23:27.480]   Rachel-- oh, you know, I forgot to record this show.
[01:23:27.480 --> 01:23:27.840]   Shoot.
[01:23:27.840 --> 01:23:29.760]   I did it again with Twit last time.
[01:23:29.760 --> 01:23:34.960]   Now we're going to record Rachel's part, particularly.
[01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:36.440]   What's the--
[01:23:36.440 --> 01:23:36.920]   I'm sorry.
[01:23:36.920 --> 01:23:38.480]   Did you say you haven't been recording this show?
[01:23:38.480 --> 01:23:40.160]   Well, I've been recording it for posterity,
[01:23:40.160 --> 01:23:41.000]   but not for talk shoot.
[01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:42.440]   There's two separate recordings.
[01:23:42.440 --> 01:23:43.160]   Oh, believe me.
[01:23:43.160 --> 01:23:43.760]   Oh, can't--
[01:23:43.760 --> 01:23:44.640]   Twit is recorded.
[01:23:44.640 --> 01:23:45.880]   No, no, no, no.
[01:23:45.880 --> 01:23:46.360]   Rachel--
[01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:47.080]   Here we go.
[01:23:47.080 --> 01:23:48.000]   Rachel, can you hear me again?
[01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:49.800]   Plus it's a series of redundant servers.
[01:23:49.800 --> 01:23:52.440]   No, I never lose shows, believe me.
[01:23:52.440 --> 01:23:53.840]   I did lose shows.
[01:23:53.840 --> 01:23:55.920]   And once I did that once, I never did again.
[01:23:55.920 --> 01:23:58.320]   Rachel, what's your podcast?
[01:23:58.320 --> 01:24:00.120]   It is Sims 2 challenges.
[01:24:00.120 --> 01:24:02.440]   We discussed different challenges for the PC game.
[01:24:02.440 --> 01:24:04.440]   With Sims 2, and it's on talk shoot.
[01:24:04.440 --> 01:24:07.480]   Sims 2 challenges.
[01:24:07.480 --> 01:24:08.040]   That's fun.
[01:24:08.040 --> 01:24:08.840]   That sounds really neat.
[01:24:08.840 --> 01:24:10.880]   I'd like to be a part of that.
[01:24:10.880 --> 01:24:11.640]   I think I'm going to--
[01:24:11.640 --> 01:24:13.000]   Can we be guests on your show?
[01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:13.560]   Guess a--
[01:24:13.560 --> 01:24:14.560]   Sure.
[01:24:14.560 --> 01:24:15.080]   Sure.
[01:24:15.080 --> 01:24:16.920]   Next one is Tuesday at 9/15.
[01:24:16.920 --> 01:24:17.520]   Tuesday at 9/15.
[01:24:17.520 --> 01:24:18.520]   Come on down.
[01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:19.040]   All right.
[01:24:19.040 --> 01:24:19.520]   All right.
[01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:20.200]   That's great.
[01:24:20.200 --> 01:24:21.600]   Talk shoot is kind of neat because talk
[01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:24.000]   shoot has this live streaming capability.
[01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:24.320]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:25.600]   I just unmuted everybody.
[01:24:25.600 --> 01:24:27.520]   Quiet, everybody.
[01:24:27.520 --> 01:24:29.200]   You press the wrong button on talk shoot.
[01:24:29.200 --> 01:24:31.600]   You're sorry.
[01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:33.640]   So it's kind of neat because it's live streaming.
[01:24:33.640 --> 01:24:37.440]   And at the same time, you can have interactivity,
[01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:39.320]   which is kind of amazing.
[01:24:39.320 --> 01:24:41.640]   Yeah, I can't get over this chat we're having.
[01:24:41.640 --> 01:24:42.640]   Any other windows?
[01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:43.560]   Is that wild?
[01:24:43.560 --> 01:24:45.920]   Yeah.
[01:24:45.920 --> 01:24:46.080]   All right.
[01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:46.920]   Let's take another call.
[01:24:46.920 --> 01:24:50.440]   Cyber Larson, you are next.
[01:24:50.440 --> 01:24:52.560]   Welcome to Twitch.
[01:24:52.560 --> 01:24:53.200]   What's your first name?
[01:24:53.200 --> 01:24:54.480]   Where are you calling from?
[01:24:54.480 --> 01:24:54.960]   Hello.
[01:24:54.960 --> 01:24:55.480]   Hello.
[01:24:55.480 --> 01:24:56.520]   Michael from Rhode Island.
[01:24:56.520 --> 01:24:58.760]   Hey, Michael.
[01:24:58.760 --> 01:25:02.880]   I have a podcast I've been doing for a couple of months.
[01:25:02.880 --> 01:25:08.920]   And my question is, how do I broadcast it or promote it?
[01:25:08.920 --> 01:25:12.080]   I've got it on pod shoot and iTunes and that.
[01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:14.600]   But I'd like to be able to promote it to get more listeners.
[01:25:14.600 --> 01:25:15.800]   I get that question a lot.
[01:25:15.800 --> 01:25:16.800]   That's--
[01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:16.800]   Yeah.
[01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:18.120]   That's the number one question.
[01:25:18.120 --> 01:25:19.120]   How do I get more people to see it?
[01:25:19.120 --> 01:25:20.920]   I'll tell you what I did.
[01:25:20.920 --> 01:25:23.680]   I worked for six years on a cable network that
[01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:24.800]   was kind of a cult thing.
[01:25:24.800 --> 01:25:26.560]   And then it folded.
[01:25:26.560 --> 01:25:27.800]   And I recommend that.
[01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:30.800]   I think that works very well.
[01:25:30.800 --> 01:25:32.440]   Some of our viewers have done is
[01:25:32.440 --> 01:25:34.880]   if you find shows that have an audience that you think
[01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:37.520]   you'd like to-- that would enjoy your show,
[01:25:37.520 --> 01:25:39.400]   get into their forums and start meeting people,
[01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:42.960]   and then gain a presence there and get yourself some friends.
[01:25:42.960 --> 01:25:44.320]   I think that's a really good way to do it.
[01:25:44.320 --> 01:25:44.920]   Yeah.
[01:25:44.920 --> 01:25:45.920]   Yeah.
[01:25:45.920 --> 01:25:48.120]   We have friends who come into the Tiki Bar chat room.
[01:25:48.120 --> 01:25:49.960]   And we have a really big, broad base of people
[01:25:49.960 --> 01:25:51.600]   who all share our sense of humor.
[01:25:51.600 --> 01:25:53.240]   And a couple of them have started the podcast.
[01:25:53.240 --> 01:25:54.880]   A couple of guys started one called Brain Gravy
[01:25:54.880 --> 01:25:57.040]   that's based on conversations from our chat room.
[01:25:57.040 --> 01:25:59.240]   And all of a sudden, they've got lots of links and lots of hits.
[01:25:59.240 --> 01:25:59.840]   And so--
[01:25:59.840 --> 01:26:00.880]   It's about community.
[01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:01.400]   Those viewers.
[01:26:01.400 --> 01:26:02.440]   Yeah, find the community you think
[01:26:02.440 --> 01:26:04.320]   is going to best like your show instead of--
[01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:04.820]   Yeah.
[01:26:04.820 --> 01:26:06.760]   --pop in and open up an account and say, hey,
[01:26:06.760 --> 01:26:07.920]   check out my podcast here.
[01:26:07.920 --> 01:26:08.680]   Take the time.
[01:26:08.680 --> 01:26:10.440]   You know everybody.
[01:26:10.440 --> 01:26:10.940]   Yeah.
[01:26:10.940 --> 01:26:12.680]   You know one of the things we did when we started before we got
[01:26:12.680 --> 01:26:18.000]   the big boost was I found Tiki Communities.
[01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:19.200]   Even though I wasn't--
[01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:22.000]   I was into Tiki because I thought it was funny.
[01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:25.680]   I wasn't over the top into Tiki.
[01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:28.200]   But we found Tiki Central.
[01:26:28.200 --> 01:26:29.800]   And I think they've got a user base.
[01:26:29.800 --> 01:26:34.400]   It's like a forum with almost 30,000 registered people there.
[01:26:34.400 --> 01:26:37.080]   And said, hey, there's a show called Tiki TV.
[01:26:37.080 --> 01:26:39.680]   And people who like Tiki will consume anything
[01:26:39.680 --> 01:26:42.240]   with the word Tiki connected to it.
[01:26:42.240 --> 01:26:43.800]   And then also--
[01:26:43.800 --> 01:26:45.880]   We took our restaurant in drunkard.com.
[01:26:45.880 --> 01:26:47.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:49.200]   Craig, what do you recommend?
[01:26:49.200 --> 01:26:50.640]   Because you really study all this stuff.
[01:26:50.640 --> 01:26:53.520]   I mean, you've become kind of the meta-podcaster.
[01:26:53.520 --> 01:26:57.360]   It is about cross-emotion when you're first starting out.
[01:26:57.360 --> 01:26:58.160]   It works very well.
[01:26:58.160 --> 01:26:59.960]   I think what Jeff was saying is great about finding
[01:26:59.960 --> 01:27:03.120]   a Tiki place that's not necessarily another podcast,
[01:27:03.120 --> 01:27:06.520]   but just in your area of interest, in your area of expertise.
[01:27:06.520 --> 01:27:08.600]   And just participate in that community,
[01:27:08.600 --> 01:27:11.040]   have your URL as your signature.
[01:27:11.040 --> 01:27:12.840]   Just be out there.
[01:27:12.840 --> 01:27:14.240]   Don't be aggro about it.
[01:27:14.240 --> 01:27:15.800]   You know, don't say, hey, we got a podcast.
[01:27:15.800 --> 01:27:16.320]   Well, yeah.
[01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:17.760]   Check it out here with this link.
[01:27:17.760 --> 01:27:18.840]   Yeah, it's going to be awesome.
[01:27:18.840 --> 01:27:20.560]   Just answer the question if you can.
[01:27:20.560 --> 01:27:21.960]   You know, if they're asking a question that's
[01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:23.560]   in your area of expertise.
[01:27:23.560 --> 01:27:25.480]   Just be gentle about it.
[01:27:25.480 --> 01:27:26.480]   Yeah.
[01:27:26.480 --> 01:27:27.680]   And that's the best way.
[01:27:27.680 --> 01:27:28.680]   Just be genuine.
[01:27:28.680 --> 01:27:29.120]   Merlin, when you--
[01:27:29.120 --> 01:27:30.800]   Otherwise, you'll be--
[01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:31.320]   go ahead.
[01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:32.800]   --in order to just look at your an ad or something.
[01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:34.520]   We've had a drive by--
[01:27:34.520 --> 01:27:35.720]   you know, yeah, you don't--
[01:27:35.720 --> 01:27:36.320]   I came up with tech.
[01:27:36.320 --> 01:27:36.820]   What's that called?
[01:27:36.820 --> 01:27:37.680]   Drive by-- Drive by--
[01:27:37.680 --> 01:27:39.080]   Drive by Link spamming.
[01:27:39.080 --> 01:27:40.680]   Oh, that's a nightmare.
[01:27:40.680 --> 01:27:42.560]   That's just--
[01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:44.680]   Merlin, when you started out--
[01:27:44.680 --> 01:27:45.800]   obviously, you're well-known now,
[01:27:45.800 --> 01:27:47.160]   so it's not quite the same issue.
[01:27:47.160 --> 01:27:50.400]   But when you were starting with 43 folders, what did you do?
[01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:52.000]   Well, I mean, as far as the podcast stuff,
[01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:53.800]   I have a real-- I mean, there's a real specific reason
[01:27:53.800 --> 01:27:56.120]   that I'm, you know, whatever trying to do things the way
[01:27:56.120 --> 01:27:57.280]   I am with the Merlin show.
[01:27:57.280 --> 01:27:59.920]   And it's partly-- so the Merlin show, part of what I do
[01:27:59.920 --> 01:28:02.280]   is I'm trying to talk to friends of mine who are not
[01:28:02.280 --> 01:28:04.680]   podcasters and who are not necessarily internet people.
[01:28:04.680 --> 01:28:06.000]   Some of them are in bands.
[01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:07.760]   They're people with-- I mean, so-- but--
[01:28:07.760 --> 01:28:10.080]   so the dirty little secret, which I'm happy to share,
[01:28:10.080 --> 01:28:12.600]   is that each of those people has their own, if you will,
[01:28:12.600 --> 01:28:14.600]   fan base, or people who enjoy what they do.
[01:28:14.600 --> 01:28:15.120]   They bring their community to it.
[01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:15.120]   Yeah.
[01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:15.620]   Yeah.
[01:28:15.620 --> 01:28:17.000]   So tomorrow morning, I'll have Peter
[01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:20.480]   Hughes from the mountain goats who have this really wonderful,
[01:28:20.480 --> 01:28:22.560]   you know, community of fans that follow the work.
[01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:24.120]   And probably a few of them will stop by.
[01:28:24.120 --> 01:28:26.000]   I guess what I would say is the most organic thing to do,
[01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:27.320]   and this is true for your blog.
[01:28:27.320 --> 01:28:30.200]   It's true for your podcast, whatever you want to do,
[01:28:30.200 --> 01:28:33.840]   is to focus on ways to, like, make your content interesting
[01:28:33.840 --> 01:28:35.480]   to a broader base of people.
[01:28:35.480 --> 01:28:36.160]   Not broader.
[01:28:36.160 --> 01:28:37.080]   Doesn't need to be broad.
[01:28:37.080 --> 01:28:38.040]   But you know what I mean?
[01:28:38.040 --> 01:28:39.920]   To try and reach out to people and let the content
[01:28:39.920 --> 01:28:40.520]   do the talking.
[01:28:40.520 --> 01:28:43.680]   There's only so much of this trickery and SEO stuff
[01:28:43.680 --> 01:28:44.560]   and link begging.
[01:28:44.560 --> 01:28:46.440]   Link begging, for me, is just about--
[01:28:46.440 --> 01:28:48.920]   That's just, you know, that's a non-starter.
[01:28:48.920 --> 01:28:49.920]   But you know what?
[01:28:49.920 --> 01:28:51.560]   If I discover your site, and something that's really interesting,
[01:28:51.560 --> 01:28:52.760]   I'm going to link to it because it's good.
[01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:55.120]   You guys said at the beginning of this show
[01:28:55.120 --> 01:28:58.240]   that excellence will out, that all you have to do is really good.
[01:28:58.240 --> 01:28:59.640]   Is that really true?
[01:28:59.640 --> 01:29:00.040]   It's really true.
[01:29:00.040 --> 01:29:01.000]   I think so.
[01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.800]   Where did you hear about-- let me ask just a couple of people
[01:29:03.800 --> 01:29:04.320]   here.
[01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:06.320]   Where did each of you hear about Tiki Bar from?
[01:29:06.320 --> 01:29:07.880]   Probably somebody else who said, hey,
[01:29:07.880 --> 01:29:09.640]   you got to watch this great podcast.
[01:29:09.640 --> 01:29:10.600]   I too was.
[01:29:10.600 --> 01:29:11.360]   Word of mouth.
[01:29:11.360 --> 01:29:12.200]   Yeah.
[01:29:12.200 --> 01:29:13.680]   When I started it was.
[01:29:13.680 --> 01:29:14.200]   I tuned.
[01:29:14.200 --> 01:29:14.960]   Yeah.
[01:29:14.960 --> 01:29:17.480]   I found that a lot of people will--
[01:29:17.480 --> 01:29:20.240]   our big boost came from different people
[01:29:20.240 --> 01:29:25.000]   with podcasts with their own audiences, saying, check this out.
[01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:25.880]   He got to check this out.
[01:29:25.880 --> 01:29:26.880]   I did that on Twitter.
[01:29:26.880 --> 01:29:27.640]   Very early on.
[01:29:27.640 --> 01:29:29.360]   I said, you got to see Tiki Bar.
[01:29:29.360 --> 01:29:31.280]   We talked a lot about Tiki Bar in Twitter, actually.
[01:29:31.280 --> 01:29:33.160]   Come to think of it.
[01:29:33.160 --> 01:29:34.440]   Yeah, it didn't take long.
[01:29:34.440 --> 01:29:34.920]   Yeah.
[01:29:34.920 --> 01:29:36.840]   Once you start interested in getting interested in something,
[01:29:36.840 --> 01:29:38.800]   you can find great links to a lot of great shows.
[01:29:38.800 --> 01:29:42.280]   But what you're saying is, if you're excellent,
[01:29:42.280 --> 01:29:44.040]   people will talk about you.
[01:29:44.040 --> 01:29:44.360]   Yes.
[01:29:44.360 --> 01:29:44.840]   Yeah.
[01:29:44.840 --> 01:29:46.040]   But you also-- I mean, the thing is,
[01:29:46.040 --> 01:29:47.280]   it's important to distinguish.
[01:29:47.280 --> 01:29:48.240]   I mean, I want to be clear.
[01:29:48.240 --> 01:29:49.920]   It isn't just like, hey, you make great content,
[01:29:49.920 --> 01:29:51.600]   and you just pray to the sky.
[01:29:51.600 --> 01:29:53.280]   You do have to go out and do some heavy lifting
[01:29:53.280 --> 01:29:54.200]   to try and reach people.
[01:29:54.200 --> 01:29:56.760]   But I'm just saying it needs to be something more organic.
[01:29:56.760 --> 01:29:58.800]   And the kind of crap you read in Dummy's books about marketing.
[01:29:58.800 --> 01:29:59.760]   Oh, I completely agree.
[01:29:59.760 --> 01:30:00.280]   Yeah.
[01:30:00.280 --> 01:30:00.920]   Right.
[01:30:00.920 --> 01:30:01.440]   I find--
[01:30:01.440 --> 01:30:04.080]   That's some turns off so bad.
[01:30:04.080 --> 01:30:05.800]   One thing that I find--
[01:30:05.800 --> 01:30:08.720]   the big question is, before they've even
[01:30:08.720 --> 01:30:11.360]   got their show produced or they've got one episode out,
[01:30:11.360 --> 01:30:13.880]   they make broad announcements about their show.
[01:30:13.880 --> 01:30:15.080]   Were this show, were that show.
[01:30:15.080 --> 01:30:16.160]   And they come and they ask us--
[01:30:16.160 --> 01:30:18.960]   and we're more than happy to do interviews with up and coming
[01:30:18.960 --> 01:30:21.440]   and startup shows and stuff like that.
[01:30:21.440 --> 01:30:23.840]   But it feels to me like, what we did
[01:30:23.840 --> 01:30:26.120]   with our first episode of Margaritaville,
[01:30:26.120 --> 01:30:29.000]   it was-- the show isn't even the product,
[01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:30.200]   and I don't want to say product.
[01:30:30.200 --> 01:30:31.480]   But the show isn't even done yet.
[01:30:31.480 --> 01:30:33.360]   It's not even made.
[01:30:33.360 --> 01:30:35.240]   In the software industry, they cut
[01:30:35.240 --> 01:30:37.720]   talk about printing the seizures before you write the software.
[01:30:37.720 --> 01:30:38.560]   That's it.
[01:30:38.560 --> 01:30:39.560]   That's it.
[01:30:39.560 --> 01:30:40.160]   That's it.
[01:30:40.160 --> 01:30:42.360]   So get the show working.
[01:30:42.360 --> 01:30:43.360]   Because--
[01:30:43.360 --> 01:30:44.280]   Free alpha casting.
[01:30:44.280 --> 01:30:45.080]   Is that what you'd call it?
[01:30:45.080 --> 01:30:45.580]   Yeah.
[01:30:45.580 --> 01:30:46.520]   Vapor casting.
[01:30:46.520 --> 01:30:47.440]   Vapor casting.
[01:30:47.440 --> 01:30:49.520]   I got to know Vapor cast, I'd like to try out on you.
[01:30:49.520 --> 01:30:50.520]   Yeah, I think.
[01:30:50.520 --> 01:30:52.480]   I got my T-shirts on a--
[01:30:52.480 --> 01:30:53.320]   Yeah, going?
[01:30:53.320 --> 01:30:54.920]   Because your show--
[01:30:54.920 --> 01:30:56.960]   from episode one to episode three even,
[01:30:56.960 --> 01:30:58.080]   will be remarkably different.
[01:30:58.080 --> 01:30:58.440]   Yeah, let's do it again.
[01:30:58.440 --> 01:30:59.920]   And you'll look back at one and go, wow,
[01:30:59.920 --> 01:31:01.360]   that wasn't even entertainment.
[01:31:01.360 --> 01:31:02.360]   I don't know what brand thing--
[01:31:02.360 --> 01:31:05.280]   Even today, when we launch a new podcast,
[01:31:05.280 --> 01:31:07.760]   I almost don't want to publish the first couple.
[01:31:07.760 --> 01:31:08.160]   I do.
[01:31:08.160 --> 01:31:09.160]   But I often say don't listen.
[01:31:09.160 --> 01:31:10.920]   That's good advice for bloggers too, though.
[01:31:10.920 --> 01:31:12.800]   I mean, I've said this for years now,
[01:31:12.800 --> 01:31:14.080]   is if you're starting a new blog
[01:31:14.080 --> 01:31:15.400]   and it's the first time you've done it,
[01:31:15.400 --> 01:31:18.440]   give yourself a few weeks to build up a backlog of content
[01:31:18.440 --> 01:31:20.000]   and to get a feel for what your voice is.
[01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:21.400]   Because you guys are exactly right.
[01:31:21.400 --> 01:31:23.920]   You never-- you could end up someplace completely different
[01:31:23.920 --> 01:31:25.040]   from where you expected.
[01:31:25.040 --> 01:31:26.440]   And it actually is much more interesting.
[01:31:26.440 --> 01:31:27.640]   It's almost like when you're a writer
[01:31:27.640 --> 01:31:29.960]   and you end up throwing out the first sentence that you write.
[01:31:29.960 --> 01:31:32.360]   I think the same thing happens with broadcast, podcast,
[01:31:32.360 --> 01:31:33.400]   blogging.
[01:31:33.400 --> 01:31:35.920]   I agree also back to the excellence thing.
[01:31:35.920 --> 01:31:38.160]   In my case, I actually created three video grants
[01:31:38.160 --> 01:31:40.120]   before I told anyone about it.
[01:31:40.120 --> 01:31:42.240]   And then showed that too.
[01:31:42.240 --> 01:31:44.160]   So I had really worked out the format ahead of time
[01:31:44.160 --> 01:31:48.560]   and had already done my 10 shows before I even did the first three.
[01:31:48.560 --> 01:31:51.400]   But having three in the can that were consistent,
[01:31:51.400 --> 01:31:53.280]   and that got the attention of Apple.
[01:31:53.280 --> 01:31:55.600]   Apple promoted it heavily and things went from there.
[01:31:55.600 --> 01:31:58.560]   So it really does help when--
[01:31:58.560 --> 01:31:59.240]   I hate it because--
[01:31:59.240 --> 01:32:00.880]   --they have to get Apple to promote, though.
[01:32:00.880 --> 01:32:02.200]   I really hate the power.
[01:32:02.200 --> 01:32:03.080]   I didn't have to.
[01:32:03.080 --> 01:32:04.280]   No, but it makes a big difference.
[01:32:04.280 --> 01:32:04.640]   It makes a big difference.
[01:32:04.640 --> 01:32:06.000]   It makes a big difference.
[01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000]   It bugs me because they're the only game in town.
[01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.520]   I mean, I'm very grateful to Apple podcasting.
[01:32:10.520 --> 01:32:12.120]   They helped put podcasting on the map.
[01:32:12.120 --> 01:32:15.360]   But at the same time, they wield way too much power.
[01:32:15.360 --> 01:32:16.080]   Editorial power.
[01:32:16.080 --> 01:32:17.120]   Yeah, but they make it easy.
[01:32:17.120 --> 01:32:18.400]   Like it's one button and you can click on it.
[01:32:18.400 --> 01:32:18.920]   No, I agree.
[01:32:18.920 --> 01:32:19.240]   And that's what--
[01:32:19.240 --> 01:32:21.440]   --tell my mom how to use an RSS feed.
[01:32:21.440 --> 01:32:22.720]   No, that's what's great about it.
[01:32:22.720 --> 01:32:25.280]   But it should be as easy on other platforms.
[01:32:25.280 --> 01:32:27.800]   And I'd like to see Microsoft step up.
[01:32:27.800 --> 01:32:29.000]   And I just think it's too bad.
[01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:32.280]   I mean, look, the guy said the iTunes guys, I love them.
[01:32:32.280 --> 01:32:32.840]   They're great guys.
[01:32:32.840 --> 01:32:34.840]   They've been very generous to do it.
[01:32:34.840 --> 01:32:38.320]   But they wield a huge amount of power.
[01:32:38.320 --> 01:32:40.640]   Isn't it interesting, though, that the story that was out--
[01:32:40.640 --> 01:32:41.440]   --stotten Pete.
[01:32:41.440 --> 01:32:41.440]   --fuse the stuff.
[01:32:41.440 --> 01:32:42.440]   --we're out.
[01:32:42.440 --> 01:32:43.280]   --got Pete, we're out.
[01:32:43.280 --> 01:32:44.160]   And we're out.
[01:32:44.160 --> 01:32:45.000]   I'm sorry, y'all love you.
[01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:45.800]   This is my official.
[01:32:45.800 --> 01:32:46.840]   We love you, man.
[01:32:46.840 --> 01:32:48.720]   Driki loves you, man.
[01:32:48.720 --> 01:32:50.480]   I said, get that in there.
[01:32:50.480 --> 01:32:52.200]   That was subtle, guys.
[01:32:52.200 --> 01:32:52.960]   That was good.
[01:32:52.960 --> 01:32:54.600]   I was going to say, and they know who they are.
[01:32:54.600 --> 01:32:55.600]   But I guess we all know.
[01:32:55.600 --> 01:32:56.640]   I wasn't going to say anything.
[01:32:56.640 --> 01:32:57.240]   But hey, sorry.
[01:32:57.240 --> 01:32:58.520]   I can't hear you guys.
[01:32:58.520 --> 01:33:00.360]   My old G4 is just so slow.
[01:33:00.360 --> 01:33:02.360]   Oh, no.
[01:33:02.360 --> 01:33:03.840]   That was not worth believing.
[01:33:03.840 --> 01:33:07.000]   That's resonating.
[01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:08.280]   What were you saying, Merlin?
[01:33:08.280 --> 01:33:09.280]   Oh, nothing.
[01:33:09.280 --> 01:33:10.280]   Nothing.
[01:33:10.280 --> 01:33:12.000]   Oh, go ahead.
[01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:13.000]   I'll say this.
[01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:14.880]   When you tell somebody you're sending the link,
[01:33:14.880 --> 01:33:16.800]   and they finally come and check out your show,
[01:33:16.800 --> 01:33:18.560]   if you only have those two episodes,
[01:33:18.560 --> 01:33:21.040]   you haven't found your voice yet, and they're rough.
[01:33:21.040 --> 01:33:24.240]   It's not like other forms of media
[01:33:24.240 --> 01:33:27.360]   were broadcast where the person may happen
[01:33:27.360 --> 01:33:30.400]   to come across season two and go, oh, this thing looks better.
[01:33:30.400 --> 01:33:31.720]   Now, maybe I'll watch it.
[01:33:31.720 --> 01:33:33.400]   The person's probably not going to come back,
[01:33:33.400 --> 01:33:34.920]   even if they've heard.
[01:33:34.920 --> 01:33:39.280]   And Tiki Bar episode one is totally different from now.
[01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:41.320]   But once you've heard of it and you've checked it out,
[01:33:41.320 --> 01:33:43.800]   and you don't like it, I don't think that audience is going
[01:33:43.800 --> 01:33:44.800]   to come back to you.
[01:33:44.800 --> 01:33:45.800]   The other part is--
[01:33:45.800 --> 01:33:46.600]   I would argue that point.
[01:33:46.600 --> 01:33:47.440]   OK, go ahead.
[01:33:47.440 --> 01:33:49.880]   I would say Tiki Bar and one is not that different.
[01:33:49.880 --> 01:33:52.240]   I think the spirit of it was there in the beginning.
[01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:53.480]   I think the soul of it is totally there.
[01:33:53.480 --> 01:33:53.960]   I agree.
[01:33:53.960 --> 01:33:54.480]   I liked it.
[01:33:54.480 --> 01:33:55.480]   I liked it too.
[01:33:55.480 --> 01:33:56.480]   And that's what I watch.
[01:33:56.480 --> 01:33:59.080]   I'm not looking for production value or magic bullet or whatever.
[01:33:59.080 --> 01:34:02.040]   I'm looking for the vibe and for the fun and the goofiness.
[01:34:02.040 --> 01:34:03.600]   And it was there from the beginning.
[01:34:03.600 --> 01:34:06.240]   And that's the reason your show is good.
[01:34:06.240 --> 01:34:07.920]   That's the thing I've been talking about.
[01:34:07.920 --> 01:34:09.160]   If the conflict is good--
[01:34:09.160 --> 01:34:09.680]   It's got a very clear--
[01:34:09.680 --> 01:34:29.780]   --off
[01:34:29.780 --> 01:34:32.380]   Now you're on NBCUniversal and you do what they say.
[01:34:32.380 --> 01:34:33.020]   But you know what?
[01:34:33.020 --> 01:34:35.420]   If you started up today, you could go out.
[01:34:35.420 --> 01:34:36.820]   So you put stuff on Libson.
[01:34:36.820 --> 01:34:37.980]   You put stuff on Blip.
[01:34:37.980 --> 01:34:39.340]   You put stuff on River.
[01:34:39.340 --> 01:34:41.540]   You put stuff on YouTube.
[01:34:41.540 --> 01:34:44.500]   You have all of these options for how you can put this stuff out.
[01:34:44.500 --> 01:34:46.580]   And you can cast your net really widely
[01:34:46.580 --> 01:34:49.020]   without worrying about the exclusivity and stuff like that.
[01:34:49.020 --> 01:34:50.580]   Which I think is a kind of a lot to give up.
[01:34:50.580 --> 01:34:52.220]   So it's another thing just to suggest.
[01:34:52.220 --> 01:34:53.820]   If you're out there and you're just getting started
[01:34:53.820 --> 01:34:55.220]   and you just want to get the word out.
[01:34:55.220 --> 01:34:57.140]   I mean, if you've got one listener and that turns into two
[01:34:57.140 --> 01:34:59.020]   listeners, you've just doubled your audience.
[01:34:59.020 --> 01:35:00.340]   So you've got to start somewhere.
[01:35:00.340 --> 01:35:02.900]   And just getting it out there is easier than ever.
[01:35:02.900 --> 01:35:05.260]   I remember when we were ecstatic, we had 1,000 viewers.
[01:35:05.260 --> 01:35:07.620]   We're like, oh my god, 1,000 people watching the show.
[01:35:07.620 --> 01:35:08.500]   And it just takes time.
[01:35:08.500 --> 01:35:09.380]   You make good stuff.
[01:35:09.380 --> 01:35:10.980]   People will watch.
[01:35:10.980 --> 01:35:13.060]   How big is-- you go to a modern library.
[01:35:13.060 --> 01:35:14.940]   There's thousands and thousands and thousands of books.
[01:35:14.940 --> 01:35:16.660]   But great ones get talked about.
[01:35:16.660 --> 01:35:17.300]   And people read them.
[01:35:17.300 --> 01:35:19.620]   And it's a new edge of media.
[01:35:19.620 --> 01:35:20.180]   It's a new year.
[01:35:20.180 --> 01:35:20.980]   There's tons out there.
[01:35:20.980 --> 01:35:23.180]   But just believe in it and put your heart into it.
[01:35:23.180 --> 01:35:23.540]   Get out there.
[01:35:23.540 --> 01:35:24.580]   Ask the ninja.
[01:35:24.580 --> 01:35:25.580]   There you go.
[01:35:25.580 --> 01:35:29.100]   DVD 127.
[01:35:29.100 --> 01:35:31.420]   I know that's not your real name unless your parents--
[01:35:31.420 --> 01:35:31.860]   [INAUDIBLE]
[01:35:31.860 --> 01:35:32.860]   real sense of humor.
[01:35:32.860 --> 01:35:33.860]   What is your real name?
[01:35:33.860 --> 01:35:35.140]   Where you calling from?
[01:35:35.140 --> 01:35:37.060]   Real name is Devoud.
[01:35:37.060 --> 01:35:39.300]   And I'm calling from Chicago, Illinois.
[01:35:39.300 --> 01:35:40.340]   Hi, Devoud.
[01:35:40.340 --> 01:35:41.340]   Welcome.
[01:35:41.340 --> 01:35:44.740]   And yes, this is the same person we'll call you on your radio
[01:35:44.740 --> 01:35:45.580]   show.
[01:35:45.580 --> 01:35:46.460]   A few years back.
[01:35:46.460 --> 01:35:48.940]   That's OK at all kind of intermingles at this point.
[01:35:48.940 --> 01:35:49.940]   It sure does.
[01:35:49.940 --> 01:35:51.740]   Yeah.
[01:35:51.740 --> 01:35:53.340]   I've been a fan of yours.
[01:35:53.340 --> 01:35:54.900]   All of yours for a while.
[01:35:54.900 --> 01:35:55.900]   Long while.
[01:35:55.900 --> 01:35:56.900]   We thank you.
[01:35:56.900 --> 01:35:57.900]   Thank you.
[01:35:57.900 --> 01:35:58.900]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:35:58.900 --> 01:36:03.900]   I completely agree on the topic of adult content on the
[01:36:03.900 --> 01:36:05.900]   internet with what you guys are saying.
[01:36:05.900 --> 01:36:09.900]   There really is no way to control it.
[01:36:09.900 --> 01:36:13.900]   And I wanted your opinion on--
[01:36:13.900 --> 01:36:17.900]   I know you guys talked about it last week.
[01:36:17.900 --> 01:36:21.900]   The whole open ID movement.
[01:36:21.900 --> 01:36:27.900]   What do you guys think will be the standard?
[01:36:27.900 --> 01:36:34.900]   Will it be open ID or will it go back to Microsoft passport?
[01:36:34.900 --> 01:36:35.900]   I'm a big fan of open ID.
[01:36:35.900 --> 01:36:38.900]   We did it just for people who want to refer back to net at night
[01:36:38.900 --> 01:36:39.900]   last week.
[01:36:39.900 --> 01:36:41.900]   We talked a little bit about open ID.
[01:36:41.900 --> 01:36:43.900]   And by the way, I just want to mention there will be no net at
[01:36:43.900 --> 01:36:44.900]   night tonight.
[01:36:44.900 --> 01:36:47.900]   That's why this show is going to go till eight or nine at night
[01:36:47.900 --> 01:36:48.900]   because--
[01:36:48.900 --> 01:36:50.900]   I just scared everybody.
[01:36:50.900 --> 01:36:52.900]   We have a bio break.
[01:36:52.900 --> 01:36:55.900]   It's going to stop because I got a P.
[01:36:55.900 --> 01:36:56.900]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:36:56.900 --> 01:36:58.900]   I wouldn't say anything.
[01:36:58.900 --> 01:36:59.900]   I mean it.
[01:36:59.900 --> 01:37:01.900]   You can always just go ahead and go off.
[01:37:01.900 --> 01:37:03.900]   Just make sure you mute your mic before you do.
[01:37:03.900 --> 01:37:05.900]   Kevin's going to open another can here.
[01:37:05.900 --> 01:37:06.900]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:37:06.900 --> 01:37:08.900]   And it ain't for drinking.
[01:37:08.900 --> 01:37:09.900]   Exactly.
[01:37:09.900 --> 01:37:10.900]   But I don't know if--
[01:37:10.900 --> 01:37:11.900]   I don't know if this window here.
[01:37:11.900 --> 01:37:13.900]   I don't know if you guys want to talk about open ID.
[01:37:13.900 --> 01:37:16.900]   But I think it is an interesting movement.
[01:37:16.900 --> 01:37:19.900]   It's so hard to predict what the next thing is going to be
[01:37:19.900 --> 01:37:21.900]   on the net and what's going to fly and what's not going to fly.
[01:37:21.900 --> 01:37:23.900]   You could see stuff get traction.
[01:37:23.900 --> 01:37:24.900]   But you never know.
[01:37:24.900 --> 01:37:25.900]   Plastics.
[01:37:25.900 --> 01:37:26.900]   Yeah.
[01:37:26.900 --> 01:37:27.900]   Plastics.
[01:37:27.900 --> 01:37:28.900]   Exactly.
[01:37:28.900 --> 01:37:29.900]   One word for you, Ben.
[01:37:29.900 --> 01:37:32.900]   But I do think we need something like open ID that validates
[01:37:32.900 --> 01:37:34.900]   who you're on the net as you go around on the net.
[01:37:34.900 --> 01:37:37.900]   But the problem, there's all these privacy issues and so forth.
[01:37:37.900 --> 01:37:39.900]   And there's also an adoption issue.
[01:37:39.900 --> 01:37:42.900]   I mean, people who use open ID are big fat geeks like me.
[01:37:42.900 --> 01:37:44.900]   I don't know if that's going to--
[01:37:44.900 --> 01:37:46.900]   I've got a PGP key, Leo.
[01:37:46.900 --> 01:37:47.900]   I mean, that's--
[01:37:47.900 --> 01:37:48.900]   I have all of that crap.
[01:37:48.900 --> 01:37:50.900]   You have CSS in your signature.
[01:37:50.900 --> 01:37:51.900]   No, no.
[01:37:51.900 --> 01:37:52.900]   Hey, Merlin, I took it out.
[01:37:52.900 --> 01:37:53.900]   Did you remove your CSS?
[01:37:53.900 --> 01:37:55.900]   Yeah, you embarrassed me into doing it.
[01:37:55.900 --> 01:37:56.900]   I went to--
[01:37:56.900 --> 01:37:58.900]   She put some JavaScript in there so I can do some DOM model stuff
[01:37:58.900 --> 01:38:00.900]   so I can hide and show your CSS.
[01:38:00.900 --> 01:38:01.900]   You know what I did?
[01:38:01.900 --> 01:38:02.900]   I write my emails in Cobol.
[01:38:02.900 --> 01:38:03.900]   Yeah.
[01:38:03.900 --> 01:38:04.900]   I just send you code and--
[01:38:04.900 --> 01:38:05.900]   Just a little school vibe.
[01:38:05.900 --> 01:38:07.900]   If you can understand it, bully for you.
[01:38:07.900 --> 01:38:09.900]   No, I actually went back to plain text, Merlin.
[01:38:09.900 --> 01:38:10.900]   I don't even sign in.
[01:38:10.900 --> 01:38:12.900]   I also eliminated-- you know, I just put my name, Leo.
[01:38:12.900 --> 01:38:13.900]   The class move, Laport.
[01:38:13.900 --> 01:38:14.900]   I'm glad you did.
[01:38:14.900 --> 01:38:15.900]   It's very classic.
[01:38:15.900 --> 01:38:16.900]   You took me a lesson.
[01:38:16.900 --> 01:38:18.900]   Ten, I am awesome.
[01:38:18.900 --> 01:38:19.900]   I am here.
[01:38:19.900 --> 01:38:20.900]   Go to ten.
[01:38:20.900 --> 01:38:21.900]   Go to ten.
[01:38:21.900 --> 01:38:23.900]   I'm not losing the linen background.
[01:38:23.900 --> 01:38:24.900]   I don't care what you say.
[01:38:24.900 --> 01:38:26.900]   I just think it looks better that way.
[01:38:26.900 --> 01:38:28.900]   Rolex Oyster.
[01:38:28.900 --> 01:38:29.900]   Nice name.
[01:38:29.900 --> 01:38:30.900]   What's your real name?
[01:38:30.900 --> 01:38:31.900]   Where are you calling from?
[01:38:31.900 --> 01:38:32.900]   Rolex Oyster.
[01:38:32.900 --> 01:38:33.900]   Hello.
[01:38:33.900 --> 01:38:34.900]   Hi.
[01:38:34.900 --> 01:38:35.900]   Hi, sweetie.
[01:38:35.900 --> 01:38:36.900]   Hi, wait a minute.
[01:38:36.900 --> 01:38:37.900]   What's your name and where are you calling from?
[01:38:37.900 --> 01:38:38.900]   My name is James.
[01:38:38.900 --> 01:38:39.900]   I'm calling from London.
[01:38:39.900 --> 01:38:40.900]   All right.
[01:38:40.900 --> 01:38:41.900]   Hey.
[01:38:41.900 --> 01:38:44.900]   I'm lovely to be in the big family of God.
[01:38:44.900 --> 01:38:46.900]   Thank you for calling in, James.
[01:38:46.900 --> 01:38:47.900]   Thank you, Deborah.
[01:38:47.900 --> 01:38:52.900]   You have a question for this fantastic panel here.
[01:38:52.900 --> 01:38:53.900]   Let me think.
[01:38:53.900 --> 01:38:54.900]   Oh.
[01:38:54.900 --> 01:38:57.900]   You've been on hold for four hours and you still don't have a question?
[01:38:57.900 --> 01:39:00.900]   Well, I just love listening to it.
[01:39:00.900 --> 01:39:01.900]   That's great.
[01:39:01.900 --> 01:39:03.900]   I have so many questions.
[01:39:03.900 --> 01:39:09.900]   First question, I got caught in the trap of an impulse buy.
[01:39:09.900 --> 01:39:13.900]   I've got an HP Pavilion laptop with a Visitor.
[01:39:13.900 --> 01:39:16.900]   And I was wondering if I made the right choice.
[01:39:16.900 --> 01:39:17.900]   This is it.
[01:39:17.900 --> 01:39:18.900]   Who said no?
[01:39:18.900 --> 01:39:20.900]   Is that you, Jimmy Craig?
[01:39:20.900 --> 01:39:22.900]   Craig says he's a Mac guy all the way.
[01:39:22.900 --> 01:39:24.900]   Hey, we're all on Mac, aren't we?
[01:39:24.900 --> 01:39:25.900]   Is there anybody here using Windows?
[01:39:25.900 --> 01:39:27.900]   I prefer to use real people.
[01:39:27.900 --> 01:39:28.900]   Is this a frislier?
[01:39:28.900 --> 01:39:29.900]   A first?
[01:39:29.900 --> 01:39:32.900]   First in terms of all the folks on the show using Mac.
[01:39:32.900 --> 01:39:36.900]   Yeah, only because Devorex still kind of hold now.
[01:39:36.900 --> 01:39:37.900]   But...
[01:39:37.900 --> 01:39:38.900]   I have a straight C.
[01:39:38.900 --> 01:39:39.900]   First of all...
[01:39:39.900 --> 01:39:41.900]   I have my Commodore 128 out right now.
[01:39:41.900 --> 01:39:43.900]   I don't think you made a mistake, James.
[01:39:43.900 --> 01:39:44.900]   I think it's fine.
[01:39:44.900 --> 01:39:45.900]   I think VIST is a big improvement.
[01:39:45.900 --> 01:39:47.900]   But it's interesting how...
[01:39:47.900 --> 01:39:49.900]   Now, maybe this is self-selecting.
[01:39:49.900 --> 01:39:50.900]   This is the whole...
[01:39:50.900 --> 01:39:52.900]   Because it's iTunes, because it's podcasts, because it's Apple.
[01:39:52.900 --> 01:39:53.900]   Maybe that's self-selecting.
[01:39:53.900 --> 01:39:58.900]   But I do notice a lot of the people who are in this content creation space are Mac fans.
[01:39:58.900 --> 01:40:00.900]   Well, it comes free with the Mac.
[01:40:00.900 --> 01:40:02.900]   I mean, you open up a Macintosh and you've got iMovie built right in.
[01:40:02.900 --> 01:40:04.900]   So, I mean, you've got QuickTime built into the software.
[01:40:04.900 --> 01:40:08.900]   You can literally start podcasting and blogging out of the box in five minutes.
[01:40:08.900 --> 01:40:10.900]   Do you think that might be one of the things that...
[01:40:10.900 --> 01:40:12.900]   We talked when you were in Vancouver.
[01:40:12.900 --> 01:40:14.900]   Actually, I don't know if you were there.
[01:40:14.900 --> 01:40:20.900]   Kevin, but Jeff and I talked about this kind of glass ceiling that podcasting seems to
[01:40:20.900 --> 01:40:21.900]   have hit.
[01:40:21.900 --> 01:40:23.900]   And I'm wondering if some of it has to do...
[01:40:23.900 --> 01:40:27.900]   You know, the number of people listening has to do with the fact that it's so Mac-centric
[01:40:27.900 --> 01:40:29.900]   that we're not crossing over into the Windows side.
[01:40:29.900 --> 01:40:31.900]   Well, I mean, you know, I don't know.
[01:40:31.900 --> 01:40:32.900]   I do.
[01:40:32.900 --> 01:40:33.900]   I'm going to be interesting.
[01:40:33.900 --> 01:40:34.900]   I don't...
[01:40:34.900 --> 01:40:35.900]   Yeah.
[01:40:35.900 --> 01:40:40.700]   Every podcast I've talked to, including the biggest, we all agree that there seems to be
[01:40:40.700 --> 01:40:45.700]   some ceiling between 300 and 400,000 downloads where you just cannot cross that number.
[01:40:45.700 --> 01:40:46.700]   Yeah.
[01:40:46.700 --> 01:40:47.700]   Yeah.
[01:40:47.700 --> 01:40:49.700]   That seems to be the audience right now.
[01:40:49.700 --> 01:40:50.700]   They're just...
[01:40:50.700 --> 01:40:51.700]   Is that everybody who's listening?
[01:40:51.700 --> 01:40:52.700]   Is that somebody who's a radio doctor?
[01:40:52.700 --> 01:40:53.700]   Yeah, I don't know.
[01:40:53.700 --> 01:40:54.700]   I guess what it is.
[01:40:54.700 --> 01:40:55.700]   I think it is right now.
[01:40:55.700 --> 01:40:56.700]   I think it is.
[01:40:56.700 --> 01:40:57.700]   I think it is.
[01:40:57.700 --> 01:40:59.700]   We're still this new fringe sort of medium, new space.
[01:40:59.700 --> 01:41:01.700]   And like the guys who are doing it are the early adopter.
[01:41:01.700 --> 01:41:02.700]   That's why I show...
[01:41:02.700 --> 01:41:06.700]   Now he's like, "Dignation is so popular because it's just tech stories and we're all nerds."
[01:41:06.700 --> 01:41:07.700]   Yeah, the tech studio.
[01:41:07.700 --> 01:41:09.700]   The tech podcast do the best, of course.
[01:41:09.700 --> 01:41:10.700]   But I'm wondering if Final Cut...
[01:41:10.700 --> 01:41:13.700]   Are you guys using Final Cut Pro as well?
[01:41:13.700 --> 01:41:14.700]   Yep.
[01:41:14.700 --> 01:41:15.700]   Oh, that's...
[01:41:15.700 --> 01:41:16.700]   Yeah.
[01:41:16.700 --> 01:41:17.700]   Yeah.
[01:41:17.700 --> 01:41:18.700]   Yeah.
[01:41:18.700 --> 01:41:19.700]   Yeah.
[01:41:19.700 --> 01:41:20.700]   Yeah.
[01:41:20.700 --> 01:41:21.700]   Yeah.
[01:41:21.700 --> 01:41:22.700]   Yeah.
[01:41:22.700 --> 01:41:23.700]   I think that has a big impact also as to why the podcast and video podcast creators are on Apple.
[01:41:23.700 --> 01:41:24.700]   Oh, certainly.
[01:41:24.700 --> 01:41:25.700]   Because...
[01:41:25.700 --> 01:41:26.700]   The greatest people are on Maddy, right?
[01:41:26.700 --> 01:41:27.700]   Yeah.
[01:41:27.700 --> 01:41:29.700]   By the way, I just want to point out that this is a global phenomenon and that's the other
[01:41:29.700 --> 01:41:30.700]   thing that's very interesting.
[01:41:30.700 --> 01:41:35.780]   Maybe 350,000 people, but it's many of them are, like James, all over the world and I
[01:41:35.780 --> 01:41:36.780]   think that's remarkable.
[01:41:36.780 --> 01:41:38.700]   Do you notice that too with Tiki?
[01:41:38.700 --> 01:41:39.700]   Yeah.
[01:41:39.700 --> 01:41:40.700]   Yeah.
[01:41:40.700 --> 01:41:41.700]   Our smartphone, AppraMap is just across the whole planet.
[01:41:41.700 --> 01:41:42.700]   Yeah.
[01:41:42.700 --> 01:41:43.700]   It's just awesome.
[01:41:43.700 --> 01:41:44.700]   You know what?
[01:41:44.700 --> 01:41:45.700]   I got an email from a guy in...
[01:41:45.700 --> 01:41:48.380]   Oh, is it Morocco?
[01:41:48.380 --> 01:41:50.180]   Where the Fez was invented, I think?
[01:41:50.180 --> 01:41:54.860]   I'm talking about how he and his friends are so amused that you have one of our hats,
[01:41:54.860 --> 01:41:56.280]   but with his animal on...
[01:41:56.280 --> 01:41:57.280]   Animal print.
[01:41:57.280 --> 01:42:01.540]   You know, it didn't occur to me that, you know, they're like, "Look what they've done
[01:42:01.540 --> 01:42:03.180]   with the hat that's ridiculous."
[01:42:03.180 --> 01:42:04.180]   Very ridiculous.
[01:42:04.180 --> 01:42:05.420]   But at least they're not offended.
[01:42:05.420 --> 01:42:06.420]   No.
[01:42:06.420 --> 01:42:09.940]   And I just got some from Oman.
[01:42:09.940 --> 01:42:11.620]   I don't know, but I got a...
[01:42:11.620 --> 01:42:12.620]   Oh, here he is.
[01:42:12.620 --> 01:42:13.620]   Yeah.
[01:42:13.620 --> 01:42:17.140]   For a while, there was getting a lot of guys, a lot of American servicemen as well.
[01:42:17.140 --> 01:42:18.460]   Yeah, we get that too.
[01:42:18.460 --> 01:42:19.460]   In Iraq, yeah.
[01:42:19.460 --> 01:42:23.820]   Lala is the Betty Hutton of the 21st century.
[01:42:23.820 --> 01:42:25.860]   I saw her picture paste on the side of a Humvee.
[01:42:25.860 --> 01:42:27.860]   Is it a town in northern?
[01:42:27.860 --> 01:42:29.220]   That's cool.
[01:42:29.220 --> 01:42:30.220]   She's on the nuclear bomb.
[01:42:30.220 --> 01:42:31.420]   What are you talking about?
[01:42:31.420 --> 01:42:33.380]   A little smiling little Lala.
[01:42:33.380 --> 01:42:34.380]   Lala.
[01:42:34.380 --> 01:42:36.260]   I know it's nobody's going to be...
[01:42:36.260 --> 01:42:40.300]   Everybody's too much of a gentleman to ask that, but Lala is wonderful and adorable as
[01:42:40.300 --> 01:42:41.780]   she seems on the show.
[01:42:41.780 --> 01:42:44.460]   She is as radiant in person as she is on the show.
[01:42:44.460 --> 01:42:45.460]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:42:45.460 --> 01:42:46.460]   Yeah.
[01:42:46.460 --> 01:42:47.460]   You would not be disappointed.
[01:42:47.460 --> 01:42:49.100]   Yeah, she's very, very...
[01:42:49.100 --> 01:42:52.700]   She seems like a very sweet, fun person.
[01:42:52.700 --> 01:42:53.700]   Yeah.
[01:42:53.700 --> 01:42:56.580]   Kind of gal you'd like you to know better.
[01:42:56.580 --> 01:43:00.020]   That's why, you know, when Kevin and I were doing that first episode, we thought, "Okay,
[01:43:00.020 --> 01:43:03.700]   well, you know, let's have a female presence, you know, when this is one of the things that
[01:43:03.700 --> 01:43:05.620]   we don't often see in podcasts."
[01:43:05.620 --> 01:43:10.540]   Well, much more now, but certainly it's leaning heavily towards men.
[01:43:10.540 --> 01:43:11.780]   And it'd be nice to have that presence.
[01:43:11.780 --> 01:43:16.020]   And our immediate thought was, "Who do you want to have at the bar with the perfect person?"
[01:43:16.020 --> 01:43:17.580]   And it's our friend Lala.
[01:43:17.580 --> 01:43:20.220]   She was a friend at acquaintance, somebody you knew?
[01:43:20.220 --> 01:43:23.780]   Everybody on the show has been a friend of somebody we know.
[01:43:23.780 --> 01:43:24.780]   Yeah.
[01:43:24.780 --> 01:43:25.780]   Mostly improv actors.
[01:43:25.780 --> 01:43:26.780]   What's their background?
[01:43:26.780 --> 01:43:27.780]   No.
[01:43:27.780 --> 01:43:33.180]   The Duke of Earl is an acupuncturist, a document of traditional Chinese medicine.
[01:43:33.180 --> 01:43:34.180]   Yeah.
[01:43:34.180 --> 01:43:35.180]   Doctor Rock.
[01:43:35.180 --> 01:43:38.340]   Well, he lives on my floor.
[01:43:38.340 --> 01:43:39.340]   Wow.
[01:43:39.340 --> 01:43:40.340]   He's a neighbor.
[01:43:40.340 --> 01:43:41.340]   He had a neighbor.
[01:43:41.340 --> 01:43:42.700]   Yeah, he had his British accent.
[01:43:42.700 --> 01:43:45.580]   And he also said that he had this really nice tuxedo.
[01:43:45.580 --> 01:43:50.780]   And I said, "Okay, why don't you come over Friday night and be on the show?"
[01:43:50.780 --> 01:43:55.260]   And he was like, "I'm not an actor, you know, but I could tell that you like to."
[01:43:55.260 --> 01:43:56.940]   He liked to ham it up.
[01:43:56.940 --> 01:43:57.940]   And that's a lot of the fun.
[01:43:57.940 --> 01:44:02.940]   The fact that he just breaks out laughing in his opening line.
[01:44:02.940 --> 01:44:04.220]   You know, I can't remember.
[01:44:04.220 --> 01:44:05.220]   He says, "It's odorous."
[01:44:05.220 --> 01:44:08.020]   And he bursts out laughing.
[01:44:08.020 --> 01:44:11.020]   And somebody asked me, I said, "Actually a friend of mine who is an actor said, "You
[01:44:11.020 --> 01:44:12.860]   know, you need to get some actors on that show.
[01:44:12.860 --> 01:44:15.980]   You know, could you find a take where the guy didn't burst out laughing?"
[01:44:15.980 --> 01:44:18.580]   I'm like, "Yeah, I think we did it twice."
[01:44:18.580 --> 01:44:20.740]   And we did have a take where he didn't laugh.
[01:44:20.740 --> 01:44:21.740]   But the first time I was laughing.
[01:44:21.740 --> 01:44:26.460]   And I left it to him to, I'm like, "Yeah, the whole point of the show is that it's unusual
[01:44:26.460 --> 01:44:27.460]   and weird."
[01:44:27.460 --> 01:44:31.020]   Isn't the best part of every Smoky in the Bandit movie, the part where Bert Reynolds
[01:44:31.020 --> 01:44:32.020]   loses it?
[01:44:32.020 --> 01:44:33.020]   Yeah.
[01:44:33.020 --> 01:44:34.020]   Did they have a...
[01:44:34.020 --> 01:44:36.020]   Is that no takes to the end?
[01:44:36.020 --> 01:44:37.420]   And the have takes to the end of every movie.
[01:44:37.420 --> 01:44:40.420]   And you stay through the lame movie because you can't wait to see the out.
[01:44:40.420 --> 01:44:41.420]   You want to see the out?
[01:44:41.420 --> 01:44:42.420]   Oh, can't have all run.
[01:44:42.420 --> 01:44:43.420]   It's a classic.
[01:44:43.420 --> 01:44:45.260]   I used to love that show.
[01:44:45.260 --> 01:44:46.260]   Absolutely.
[01:44:46.260 --> 01:44:47.260]   And Mr. Sammy Davis Jr.
[01:44:47.260 --> 01:44:50.860]   And when you watch shows like the Carol Burnett Show, that was half the fun of it is that they
[01:44:50.860 --> 01:44:51.860]   couldn't do the skits.
[01:44:51.860 --> 01:44:54.260]   And watching Tim Conroy try and keep a straight face.
[01:44:54.260 --> 01:44:55.860]   That's what you hope for.
[01:44:55.860 --> 01:44:56.860]   And that's kind of the fun.
[01:44:56.860 --> 01:45:00.500]   I mean, like we can absolutely break rules doing this new video, this podcasting stuff.
[01:45:00.500 --> 01:45:02.500]   We can do stuff that you can't do under the television.
[01:45:02.500 --> 01:45:04.500]   That's what makes it so interesting.
[01:45:04.500 --> 01:45:05.500]   I have so many...
[01:45:05.500 --> 01:45:06.500]   Go ahead.
[01:45:06.500 --> 01:45:07.500]   I know.
[01:45:07.500 --> 01:45:08.500]   I'll listen.
[01:45:08.500 --> 01:45:09.500]   I'll talk.
[01:45:09.500 --> 01:45:10.500]   I just have so many calls.
[01:45:10.500 --> 01:45:11.500]   I want to get through a couple more.
[01:45:11.500 --> 01:45:14.620]   This is going to be our first two hour to it, but I just can't stop.
[01:45:14.620 --> 01:45:20.100]   But we have to because everybody's got a P. Madhouse Radio.
[01:45:20.100 --> 01:45:21.660]   Hello, Madhouse Radio.
[01:45:21.660 --> 01:45:23.660]   What's your first name and where are you calling from?
[01:45:23.660 --> 01:45:24.660]   Hey, Leo.
[01:45:24.660 --> 01:45:25.660]   How you doing, buddy?
[01:45:25.660 --> 01:45:26.660]   Hey.
[01:45:26.660 --> 01:45:27.660]   This is Carlos.
[01:45:27.660 --> 01:45:31.380]   And let's say hi to you and all the Tiki Bar guys.
[01:45:31.380 --> 01:45:34.980]   I love Tiki Bar and Leop have been following you for like five, six years.
[01:45:34.980 --> 01:45:35.980]   Thank you, Carlos.
[01:45:35.980 --> 01:45:36.980]   And that's the light.
[01:45:36.980 --> 01:45:37.980]   I have the...
[01:45:37.980 --> 01:45:40.300]   I've been doing internet radio for two years.
[01:45:40.300 --> 01:45:43.260]   And I was just wondering what this whole legislature got coming out.
[01:45:43.260 --> 01:45:44.660]   Oh, this is awful stuff.
[01:45:44.660 --> 01:45:50.540]   You know, my expenses now for streaming are, you know, and I'm hosted.
[01:45:50.540 --> 01:45:54.060]   I'm kind of like family cats and several different stations out there.
[01:45:54.060 --> 01:45:55.780]   What's the name of your show?
[01:45:55.780 --> 01:45:56.780]   I do Madhouse Radio.
[01:45:56.780 --> 01:45:59.300]   It was like, you know, we play a little music mostly.
[01:45:59.300 --> 01:46:02.020]   We're just comedy and talking and we do, you know, crank calls.
[01:46:02.020 --> 01:46:06.300]   I feel bad for people who play music because you're not going to be able to do it anymore.
[01:46:06.300 --> 01:46:08.900]   Although fortunately NPR has decided to fight this.
[01:46:08.900 --> 01:46:09.900]   Yeah.
[01:46:09.900 --> 01:46:10.900]   It's a really good thing.
[01:46:10.900 --> 01:46:14.620]   I'm really concerned with the fact that it has to take all the music out of my show to
[01:46:14.620 --> 01:46:16.460]   be strictly a talk comedy show.
[01:46:16.460 --> 01:46:17.460]   Yeah.
[01:46:17.460 --> 01:46:18.460]   It's kind of dull.
[01:46:18.460 --> 01:46:19.460]   We kind of like to break things off.
[01:46:19.460 --> 01:46:20.460]   It's stupid.
[01:46:20.460 --> 01:46:21.460]   It's stupid.
[01:46:21.460 --> 01:46:25.740]   It's the radio and it's the music industry not getting their business.
[01:46:25.740 --> 01:46:27.980]   I just understand entirely what their business is.
[01:46:27.980 --> 01:46:29.500]   It's just stupid.
[01:46:29.500 --> 01:46:32.380]   I listen to a radio channel.
[01:46:32.380 --> 01:46:33.380]   I hear a good song.
[01:46:33.380 --> 01:46:34.380]   I look at the name.
[01:46:34.380 --> 01:46:35.380]   I go to the iTunes store and buy the album.
[01:46:35.380 --> 01:46:36.380]   Yeah.
[01:46:36.380 --> 01:46:38.380]   I'm not making that connection.
[01:46:38.380 --> 01:46:39.380]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:46:39.380 --> 01:46:40.380]   It's ridiculous.
[01:46:40.380 --> 01:46:45.380]   It's, you know, when I don't know who was at Viacom that was ordering, you know, another
[01:46:45.380 --> 01:46:46.860]   swing crap.
[01:46:46.860 --> 01:46:51.660]   But they were ordering, you know, a three minute clip of a, of a, tonight show monologue being
[01:46:51.660 --> 01:46:52.660]   taken down.
[01:46:52.660 --> 01:46:57.140]   I'm thinking in what way is that removing business from that show?
[01:46:57.140 --> 01:46:59.580]   And it's so funny because these are the guys who go to conferences saying we're totally
[01:46:59.580 --> 01:47:00.580]   embracing the web.
[01:47:00.580 --> 01:47:01.580]   We're all about new media.
[01:47:01.580 --> 01:47:04.140]   And then the other other hand is saying, oh, wait a minute.
[01:47:04.140 --> 01:47:06.060]   That can't give up a 30 second clip of the daily show.
[01:47:06.060 --> 01:47:11.500]   You know, I can say to that story about the whole, the, the whole we're not YouTube can,
[01:47:11.500 --> 01:47:14.140]   you know, group that's trying to put together, you know, we talked about the top of the show
[01:47:14.140 --> 01:47:17.260]   about five hours ago about together.
[01:47:17.260 --> 01:47:18.780]   It's like basically everybody who's not Google.
[01:47:18.780 --> 01:47:21.620]   And if so, a, I think Google is probably just rubbing their hands and going, oh, by
[01:47:21.620 --> 01:47:25.900]   all means go have fun in the Briar patch, you guys making a mess of, you know, because
[01:47:25.900 --> 01:47:28.900]   you, you know, you try and get more than one company together to agree on anything and
[01:47:28.900 --> 01:47:30.460]   it's going to be crazy.
[01:47:30.460 --> 01:47:31.940]   But you're absolutely right.
[01:47:31.940 --> 01:47:36.340]   And so to, to just see all of these companies, especially the music industry at this point,
[01:47:36.340 --> 01:47:40.100]   burning cycles, when they could be out there trying to be two years ahead instead of five
[01:47:40.100 --> 01:47:41.100]   years behind.
[01:47:41.100 --> 01:47:43.860]   And it's, you know, you understand why they're doing this because they want to make their
[01:47:43.860 --> 01:47:44.860]   dough day to day.
[01:47:44.860 --> 01:47:47.740]   But at the same time, they're just, they're burning cycles like crazy right now.
[01:47:47.740 --> 01:47:50.780]   I, it's, the MSF is a room full of lawyers who are bored.
[01:47:50.780 --> 01:47:53.220]   Like today we're going to go after internet radio.
[01:47:53.220 --> 01:47:56.220]   Yeah, they high five and go lunch a lot.
[01:47:56.220 --> 01:47:59.860]   Have you heard the Corey doctor wrote, you know, oh yeah, Corey's been on the show many
[01:47:59.860 --> 01:48:00.860]   times.
[01:48:00.860 --> 01:48:01.860]   He's great.
[01:48:01.860 --> 01:48:02.860]   Oh, well, he gave this great talk.
[01:48:02.860 --> 01:48:05.420]   I think it was, it was in this now defunct DigiMart.
[01:48:05.420 --> 01:48:11.100]   I don't know if you can download it with this great talk that he gave about the history
[01:48:11.100 --> 01:48:12.100]   of copyright.
[01:48:12.100 --> 01:48:13.100]   Yeah.
[01:48:13.100 --> 01:48:23.540]   And then we're going to go and go and go and go to the internet and go to the internet.
[01:48:23.540 --> 01:48:30.160]   And you know, I think we're going to go, we're going to go to the internet and go to the
[01:48:30.160 --> 01:48:32.120]   internet, and go to the internet.
[01:48:32.120 --> 01:48:37.380]   And we're going to go to the internet where we're going to go to the internet.
[01:48:37.380 --> 01:48:40.140]   And we're going to go to the internet, and then we'll go to the internet.
[01:48:40.140 --> 01:48:45.140]   And then we'll go to the internet.
[01:48:45.140 --> 01:48:47.140]   And then we'll go to the internet.

[01:48:57.140 --> 01:48:58.140]   And then we'll go to the internet.
[01:48:58.140 --> 01:48:59.140]   And then we'll go to the internet.
[01:48:59.140 --> 01:49:00.140]   And then we'll go to the internet.
[01:49:00.140 --> 01:49:01.140]   And then we'll go to the internet.

[01:49:04.140 --> 01:49:05.140]   And then we'll go to the internet.
[01:49:05.140 --> 01:49:06.140]   And then we'll go to the internet.
[01:49:06.140 --> 01:49:07.140]   And then we'll go to the internet.
[01:49:07.140 --> 01:49:08.140]   And then we'll go to the internet.

[01:49:17.140 --> 01:49:18.140]   And then we'll go to the internet.
[01:49:18.140 --> 01:49:19.140]   And then we'll go to the internet.
[01:49:19.140 --> 01:49:20.140]   And then we'll go to the internet.
