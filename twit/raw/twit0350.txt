[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   But we can talk about it right now as we gather around our Sunday round table,
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   starting to my left with Dwight Silverman of the Houston Chronicle Tech Blog.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Blog.cron.com/techblog.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   Hey Dwight!
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   Hello, how are you Leo?
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   I'm very good.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   You also host the technology Bites Show.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   That's right on Wednesday nights on KPFT.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   KPFT.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   Are they back on the air where they were down for a while, right?
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   Oh, oh, you saw that.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   Yeah, we had a lightning strike hit the tower.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   Wow.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   And I'm not sure that it's the power, the power is all the way back up.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   But we are back on the air.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   We were streaming, of course, the whole time online.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   But that's the second lightning strike at that station.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   They did it on a, the lightning hit the station itself several months ago and knocked out a bunch of the equipment.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   And of course, it's a little Pacifica station.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   And so, find the money, you know, to fix those things.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   It's a little medieval, or does that sound like a sign from God that maybe George Bush was right?
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   I don't know.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   Well, you know, KPFT early on when it first went on the air was bombed off the air by the KKK.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   So they kind of wear that as a badge of pride.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   So, you know, so now God and the Klan hate.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   That's right.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   God and the Klan coming after you.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Wow.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   Strange bedfellas.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   And I'm just a Josh and you know, I'm a raging liberal and it's great.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   It's great to have you.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   Thank you for being here also to on our on our Skype today.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   Oh, Malek with his hot new I LPR 40 microphone.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   That's right.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   That's right.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   How are you doing, Leo?
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   I'm closing my eyes and just a mat.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   You just like you're here with us on.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   I am.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   I've always been with you.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   I'm a con.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   That sounds so good.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   Oh, of course, is the guy who created giga ohm.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   And it's just the guy.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   He wants to call me the Yoda of tech.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   He's the Yoda of tech.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   No, no, with that voice, he's like, he's like Obi-Wan Kenobi.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   He's Obi-Wan Kenobi.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   He's just this embodied voice reassuring us to trust ourselves.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   So actually he's been dead for years.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   Is that what you're saying?
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   You didn't know that.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   That you've had poor grammar.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   I'm a whole other grammar.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   Anyway, it was great to get you back on.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   You've been all over the place since we talked last.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   I love following you on path because ohm travels like crazy.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   And you were in India, I know.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   And just fun to watch.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   Fun to follow.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   And to see my mother, my dad, I had fun.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   But you're back.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   I am.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   And apparently the thing that you missed most was coffee.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   Yeah, all this is a problem.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   He was like, towards the end of the trip posting pictures of sight glass coffee.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   Someday.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   I'll get back to coffee.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   Come back to me.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   Come back.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   Good tea though.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   That was great tea.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   Oh, I bet.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   I went to New York after that.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   Seattle.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   It was fun.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   It's been a good travel year for me.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   What are you looking for, um?
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   I'm looking for inspiration.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   And did you find it?
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   A little bit.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   I think the more interesting way to think about technology is to look outside technology.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   And I go to all these places looking for that.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   And I come back with it.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   Very refreshed.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   And with a fresh perspective on things.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   And if you live in Silicon Valley too long, you start smoking the air.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   Which we have here and start believing and start believing what is essentially Silicon Valley
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   trying to solve Silicon Valley's problems.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   It becomes an echo chamber.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   So I went out basically to look for reality in real people and how they use technology.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   Wow.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   What a concept.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   I don't know.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   How was that?
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   I don't know if I could handle real people.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   I think, you know, you do a really good job with that, Leo.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   I think, you know, it's just, it's very nice to see the show and still not feel that it's
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   incitary.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   It's quite...
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   It's the challenge.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   One of the reasons I didn't move to San Francisco is because it is San Francisco really is.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   Like you go down this everywhere you go.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   You go to McDonald's and there's a guy talking about his, you know, his B round of funding.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   And here it's a little bit more, you know, well, we talk about cows and eggs.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   I'm just trying.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.840]   The butter and eggs, I want to invite you all.
[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:39.720]   The butter and eggs day parade is coming up next weekend.
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:43.440]   And if you're in town, it's a wonderful little parade.
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:49.000]   It's petaloom in such a small town that everybody in town is actually in the parade.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   Wow.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.160]   But the way they handle that so that somebody's watching is you lead the parade and then
[00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:57.160]   it goes around in a circle and then you sit down and you watch the next people who come
[00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:01.440]   around so that everybody gets to be in the parade and watch the parade.
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:04.160]   And it's a wonderful family time for all.
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:05.160]   There we go.
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:06.160]   It's really good.
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:07.160]   It's really good.
[00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:10.960]   You remember the beginning of Blue Velvet, the slow motion fire truck going by?
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:11.960]   Sure.
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:14.560]   It's just like that minus the gas mask in the.
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.480]   I'm not too fond of that.
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:18.440]   Does the parade have an app Leo?
[00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:19.440]   It should.
[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:21.560]   You know, petaloom in there's no, we don't have apps here.
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:23.520]   We should have butter and eggs app.
[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:24.800]   Why don't we have an app?
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:25.800]   That's a great idea.
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:29.120]   The butter can talk to the eggs about their series B round of funding.
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:30.120]   Exactly.
[00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:31.120]   There.
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:34.920]   One of the things in the echo chamber we talked about it for several weeks now is that billion
[00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:39.480]   dollar Instagram purchase that felt very bubbly.
[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:40.480]   Didn't it all more?
[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:41.480]   What did that feel like to real people?
[00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:43.120]   I mean, what do they think?
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:47.640]   I think there is an interesting after effect of that deal, which is going to happen is
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:50.440]   a lot more people will be moving to San Francisco.
[00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:51.440]   Yeah.
[00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:56.040]   Because it's the, you know, it's like the firing gun has been shot.
[00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:58.160]   The starting gun has been fired.
[00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:01.040]   So people can come here and start companies.
[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:08.080]   And essentially, you know, I think the way I thought of Instagram is why, and I think
[00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:16.280]   a lot of mainstream people saw Instagram, they saw it as a way to start in your own reality
[00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:17.280]   TV show.
[00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:18.280]   Right.
[00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:21.960]   Essentially, you create your own reality and you follow all these people, you talk to them.
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:26.000]   It just is essentially a reflection of our modern society.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.040]   And that's why it took off and it got 30 million people only on iPhone, which is quite quite
[00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:32.040]   astonishing.
[00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:38.440]   So I think from that perspective, it's a pretty, you know, it is an interesting company on
[00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:39.440]   the valuation.
[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:45.680]   I mean, geez, when you are, you know, talking about people like Mark Zuckerberg with a
[00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:49.240]   hundred billion dollar Facebook, it just is a rounding error.
[00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:52.080]   So bubbly or not, I don't know.
[00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:53.080]   Right.
[00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:56.320]   So with it, Justin Robert Young, love having Justin in studio.
[00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:57.320]   It's so great.
[00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:58.320]   Hi.
[00:08:58.320 --> 00:08:59.320]   Hi.
[00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:00.320]   Hey, everybody.
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:03.000]   He's a regular host on NSFW, but you don't ever see him in person.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.120]   No, I very rarely make personal appearances.
[00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:07.200]   I'm so great.
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:08.200]   Reclusive.
[00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:09.200]   Like Howard Hughes.
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:14.160]   I just, I lock myself up and he's been peeing in jars around the studio all day.
[00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:15.160]   It's very strange.
[00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:17.600]   You know, I got to make sure that the energy feels right.
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.000]   I got to feel it home.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.600]   I got to have my jars.
[00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:23.520]   I know those weird things podcast.
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:24.520]   Yep.
[00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:25.840]   And you read, in fact, we're giving you the link for this.
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:27.240]   You read some of Andrew Maine's stories.
[00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:28.240]   Yeah, that's the new one.
[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:33.400]   The new one is Andrew Maine stories, the podcast, which I read audiobook style in New
[00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:37.720]   Andrew Maine, a new Andrew Maine short story every week.
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.600]   And that's going really cool.
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:43.000]   And yeah, that's that's the weird things site right there for anybody watching live.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.400]   I've been reading public anime zero on my Kindle.
[00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:48.040]   That is heart stopping.
[00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:49.040]   Yeah.
[00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:50.040]   Yeah.
[00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:51.040]   That is the best.
[00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:54.480]   You know, I thought for a long time, Snow Crash was the best first chapter ever written.
[00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:55.480]   Wow.
[00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:57.960]   I'm not saying Snow Crash yet, but it's close.
[00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:59.120]   It gets your heart pumping.
[00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:03.840]   I'll tell you what, I'm so I'm actually Andrew's not watching live because he's in Italy right
[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:06.440]   now, but he's going to be very excited to hear you say that.
[00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:07.440]   That's great.
[00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:08.440]   No, it's super cool.
[00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:11.200]   And that book is actually you can download for free on podcast.
[00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:15.980]   I read the entire audiobook version of that that you can get on iTunes or buy it on
[00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:19.140]   an interrupt at at Andrew Maine.com/books.
[00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:23.020]   But listen to that better, you know, like not exactly snow crash, but close to that.
[00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:24.620]   It must have been fun to read actually.
[00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:30.140]   Yeah, I loved reading that book is certainly a very atmospheric.
[00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:33.140]   So let's see, Microsoft's numbers are out.
[00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:34.140]   I don't know.
[00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:36.300]   Gosh, it seems like it's a lot of.
[00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:40.660]   I don't even want to talk about stuff like that, but we've got such great, inspiring
[00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:41.660]   people here.
[00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:43.580]   And I'm talking about quarterly results for Michael.
[00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:47.620]   They had a good quarter.
[00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:50.860]   They had a good quarter largely based on their enterprise.
[00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:55.260]   But what was kind of surprising about that was what had been the shining star last year,
[00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:59.460]   which was connect and the entertainment division was flat.
[00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:04.060]   And there was a lot of enterprise money in this one in advance of Windows 8, which is
[00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:05.300]   also kind of interesting.
[00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:06.300]   Yeah.
[00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:10.500]   Now, of course, Windows, this always happens right before a new Windows comes out, which
[00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:12.300]   is there's a pause.
[00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:15.980]   It's almost like everybody in the PC industry holds their breath.
[00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:19.020]   Nobody buys anything waiting for the next version of Windows.
[00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:23.260]   So maybe we won't see that in this quarter, but then the quarter that we're in right now
[00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:24.260]   might see that.
[00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:29.500]   But boy, what's interesting about Windows 8 is that right now we're kind of in the upswing
[00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:33.460]   of the cycle of people moving off of XP, you know, businesses have not.
[00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:34.460]   XP.
[00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:37.500]   And now they moved off of XP.
[00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:39.260]   That's three versions ago.
[00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:40.260]   I know.
[00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:41.260]   I know.
[00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:45.180]   And so I don't know necessarily that businesses are going to move to Windows 8.
[00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:47.620]   This is right now.
[00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:53.660]   Now why is the this is the migration now for businesses and Windows 8 will be consumer
[00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:54.900]   if it sells at all.
[00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:55.900]   If at all.
[00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:56.900]   Right.
[00:11:56.900 --> 00:12:01.300]   Why is it attractive to enterprise?
[00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:04.820]   Because it's a tablet operating system on a desktop computer.
[00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:08.340]   I don't even it baffles me that Microsoft.
[00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:12.300]   Now I like it by the way, because it's kind of cool and fun.
[00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:15.140]   And I kind of like the interface, but it's going to drive businesses crazy because they
[00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:16.820]   don't want cool and fun.
[00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:17.820]   They want productivity.
[00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:19.060]   They want a desktop.
[00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:24.780]   They want everything to look like it did in Windows 7 or actually Windows XP.
[00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:26.860]   I finally got a chance to put it on a tablet.
[00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:31.260]   I had tried it at the build conference in September and they made the press give the
[00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:32.980]   tablets back just before we left.
[00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:36.900]   And I got a chance to install it this week again on a tablet with the consumer bill.
[00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:37.900]   What do you think?
[00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:38.900]   It's much better.
[00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:40.420]   It's much better on a tablet.
[00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:47.780]   But the problem with it is that it really forces you tablet or a desktop to keep going
[00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:50.700]   back to the Metro interface.
[00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:56.100]   And I think if people just want to use Excel and Word and the traditional versions of desktop
[00:12:56.100 --> 00:13:01.620]   software, they're not going to have any need for Windows 8.
[00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:04.700]   And if they're not interested in Metro, they're just going to leave it aside.
[00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:07.820]   And right now, there's not that much that's compelling about Metro.
[00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:15.340]   I think the transition when you make the shift in the operating system from desktop to Metro
[00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:16.580]   is a little jarring.
[00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:20.060]   And some of the things I've heard kind of on the side from Microsoft about what they're
[00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:25.300]   working on as they run up to the goal master will address that.
[00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:31.420]   But I still think forcing people to use that Metro interface with what they want to use
[00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:35.380]   to use the desktop is going to backfire on them similar to kind of the way Vista did,
[00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:36.700]   I think a little bit.
[00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:45.980]   Meanwhile, though, $17.41 billion in revenue, 6% up, $5 billion in profit.
[00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:47.860]   It was a very good quarter for them.
[00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:55.020]   And this waiting for all of their newer products, Windows 8, Office 15, Windows phone has not
[00:13:55.020 --> 00:14:00.380]   been, I don't think added too much, as you said, to the overall.
[00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:04.820]   Xbox is kind of long and the tooth connects cool, but that was last year.
[00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:09.860]   What do you, Omar, do you care about Windows 8 at all?
[00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:10.860]   I don't.
[00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:13.900]   It used to be the big story, right?
[00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:15.820]   What's Windows going to be?
[00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:21.700]   I think, you know, there's a lot of people who care about Windows 8.
[00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:23.500]   I just don't happen to be one of them.
[00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:28.180]   So I'll be wrong in giving any kind of opinion about it.
[00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:34.420]   I have seen it and I've used it and I think it'll be a great tablet environment.
[00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:38.700]   I just think it'll be pretty awesome for the tablet environment.
[00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:42.340]   I have not experienced any productivity.
[00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:47.020]   I will make it just a random observation, which has got nothing to do with Windows,
[00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:53.900]   is that more and more of my computing time has been siphoned off by my iPad and my iPhone.
[00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:59.300]   It could have been Android devices if they were, you know, I had those, but it just is
[00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:05.020]   the tablet and the phone have taken more of my compute cycles.
[00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:12.260]   And so the computer itself is reduced to, you know, doing the video conversation with
[00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:17.060]   you right now and basically writing those long-form posts.
[00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:23.260]   Even those I don't do anymore on the computer.
[00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.340]   It's for heavy lifting, but you know what?
[00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:26.500]   Skype on the iPad.
[00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:27.740]   It's actually great.
[00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:30.060]   I don't even Skype on the desktop anymore.
[00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:31.060]   It's so great on the iPad.
[00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:32.060]   Yeah.
[00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:33.060]   And then I kind of use my fancy--
[00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:34.940]   I know you have a fancy one.
[00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:37.860]   We did that so you'd have to use a computer.
[00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:42.140]   Well, the one thing about Windows 8 is they do seem like they announced this week that
[00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:46.780]   they're simplifying the versions that they're coming out with.
[00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:47.780]   They're forscuse.
[00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:49.700]   That was the big announcement is they're going to do--
[00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:50.900]   Thank God they did this.
[00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:52.660]   Well, because it's been crazy.
[00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:58.300]   If it's going to be a consumer operating system, if it's not going to super appeal to enterprise,
[00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:03.780]   then it makes sense to kind of not make it the Windows agriculture edition.
[00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:08.780]   You know, Windows, if you have four or two, five kids, you know, like to just have a very
[00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:13.340]  -- it's not as simple as, let's say, what Apple does where they just released AOS and
[00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:15.500]   you put the OS on or you don't have it on.
[00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:16.500]   It's close to it.
[00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:18.660]   There's Windows 8.
[00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:21.020]   Windows 8.
[00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:24.700]   And then there's Windows 8 Pro, which is the business version.
[00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:28.020]   And then there's Windows 8 Enterprise, which is even more-- actually that has to do with
[00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:30.980]   the licensing more than the capabilities.
[00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:33.220]   And then there's Windows 8 China.
[00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:36.540]   Yes, CN.
[00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:37.540]   Windows RT.
[00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:38.540]   Yeah.
[00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:40.660]   Oh, I forgot RT, which is the tablet.
[00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:43.140]   Now that is the worst name I can think of.
[00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:44.940]   I call it Windows Retweet.
[00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:45.940]   Yes.
[00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:48.060]   What would you-- what?
[00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:52.580]   This is guaranteeing that no one will be able to find Windows 8 when they search for it,
[00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:53.580]   the tablet for it.
[00:16:53.580 --> 00:17:01.660]   And it won't run-- the Windows RT won't run any legacy desktop apps except for the ones
[00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:04.380]   that ship with Windows, like it'll run notepad.
[00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:05.380]   Right.
[00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:06.620]   But it's basically Metro-- Metro Metro Metro.
[00:17:06.620 --> 00:17:07.620]   Right.
[00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:08.620]   Right.
[00:17:08.620 --> 00:17:12.220]   And it will also-- I just read a piece today-- it won't work with Active Directory.
[00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:16.900]   So if you're thinking about bringing it into work and handing it to your IT guy and say,
[00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:21.380]   here, hook this up to our domain, it won't do it.
[00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:27.780]   And it won't do it the same-- the x86, the traditional tablets, the Intel-based tablets,
[00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:31.660]   won't do it the same way that the desktop version will either.
[00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:34.900]   They have to use something called Intune, which will let it connect.
[00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:39.740]   So it's not even necessarily going to be all that friendly in the enterprise.
[00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:43.340]   We should explain for the Mac users in the audience that Metro does not mean it gets
[00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:47.140]   many petties and buys its shoes at Tootsie Ploughtown.
[00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:54.100]   It means that it's the zoom crisscrossy.
[00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:55.300]   It's that tablet interface.
[00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:56.300]   Yeah.
[00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:57.300]   Hotiles.
[00:17:57.300 --> 00:17:58.300]   Yeah.
[00:17:58.300 --> 00:17:59.300]   It also enjoys cosmopolitan.
[00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:01.900]   I think it would be better if it liked cosmos.
[00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:04.140]   I think really that would be better.
[00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:05.140]   Yeah.
[00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:06.140]   What a terrible name.
[00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:07.140]   Money is wrong.
[00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:08.140]   Capripants.
[00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:09.140]   What?
[00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:10.140]   So am I.
[00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:15.140]   What is wrong with that, Microsoft, that they call this, which I think is probably their
[00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:19.860]   greatest hope, given that the iPad has got to be killing them.
[00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:23.340]   The Windows RT, which by the way, it already has.
[00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:25.140]   There already is a Windows RT.
[00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:27.420]   That's the core services.
[00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:28.420]   It's the Windows runtime.
[00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:29.420]   Right.
[00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:31.460]   And this is Windows real time is what--
[00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:32.460]   Is that what it means?
[00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:33.460]   Is that it?
[00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:34.460]   Yeah.
[00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:35.460]   Real time, yeah.
[00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:36.460]   What does it do?
[00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:37.940]   And why not call it real time?
[00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:38.940]   It's not even like--
[00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:41.020]   Oh, you've been hanging out with real people too much, oh my god.
[00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:42.940]   I can tell that right now.
[00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:43.940]   What does it do?
[00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:44.940]   It runs on the part.
[00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:47.580]   Well, whatever it does, it does it in real time.
[00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:48.980]   It's not recorded.
[00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:50.420]   It's not an echo.
[00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:52.220]   They're not tape delayed.
[00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:53.220]   It's real time, baby.
[00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:55.980]   What does it do?
[00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:56.980]   That's a great question, Bill.
[00:18:56.980 --> 00:18:57.980]   I have no idea.
[00:18:57.980 --> 00:19:00.140]   Why is it just runtime?
[00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:01.460]   I'm sorry it is runtime.
[00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:04.060]   No, it's not runtime because runtime is WinRT.
[00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:05.060]   Oh, right.
[00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:06.060]   Right.
[00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:07.060]   That's what it-- right.
[00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:08.060]   The Windows RT--
[00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:09.060]   Oh, Bill Todd.
[00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:10.500]   See, you see the confusion.
[00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:11.500]   Sure, sure.
[00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:12.500]   Yeah.
[00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:13.500]   I think it's real title.
[00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:14.500]   Windows real title.
[00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:15.860]   I like Windows Retweet.
[00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:16.860]   I really do.
[00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:18.340]   I think that's really ex-retweet.
[00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:21.940]   Rotten Tomatoes.
[00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:22.940]   Really tired.
[00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:27.140]   I think this is Windows for ARM, right?
[00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:28.140]   Like this.
[00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:29.780]   Yes, this is what they used to call Woa.
[00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:30.780]   Yeah.
[00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:33.660]   Aren't they just colored Windows for ARM?
[00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:34.660]   Yeah.
[00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:35.660]   Or tablet Windows.
[00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:36.660]   Or Windows tablet.
[00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:39.060]   Or colored Windows AT, you know.
[00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:40.060]   Windows tablet edition.
[00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:41.060]   What would be wrong with that?
[00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:43.620]   Well, doesn't this all just seem like too many cooks in the kitchen?
[00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:48.540]   And really the difference between having a clear artistic vision or a clear vision to
[00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:52.980]   say this is what it is and we want to communicate with people who would like to buy and install
[00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:56.980]   this service in a very--
[00:19:56.980 --> 00:19:57.980]   I think you're right.
[00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:02.100]   I think it's a case of-- there probably were better names, but the differing warring
[00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:03.580]   parties couldn't agree to the kids--
[00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:04.580]   Yeah.
[00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:05.580]   What would they call a tablet?
[00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:06.580]   The chalet is like, "Where?"
[00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:11.100]   It shows the name no one liked, but no one hated, no one owned because it was the only
[00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:12.500]   thing politically they could do.
[00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:13.500]   Yeah.
[00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:14.500]   I mean, that's what it sounds like to me.
[00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:15.500]   I have no thought.
[00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:16.500]   Windows random thought.
[00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:17.500]   I like that.
[00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:18.500]   I said--
[00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:19.500]   A certain RT that I can't say.
[00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:20.500]   I got to get your opinion, guys.
[00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:21.500]   We're going to take a break.
[00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:25.260]   When we come back, I got to get your opinion on what the FBI just did because I can tell
[00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:30.180]   you in the real world it's making people nuts.
[00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:35.420]   And there are now articles in every mainstream journal saying your internet may stop working
[00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:37.100]   July 9th.
[00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:38.260]   And this is making people nuts.
[00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:42.860]   And I think it was reprehensible of the FBI, but I want to get you to tell me because I
[00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:44.300]   may be completely wrong.
[00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:46.420]   No, they did not order hookers.
[00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:47.980]   That was another story entirely.
[00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:48.980]   We're going to talk--
[00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:49.980]   That's the secret service.
[00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:50.980]   It's not the secret division.
[00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:51.980]   Please.
[00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:55.660]   Do not confuse your federal agents.
[00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:59.100]   But first-- thank you, Chatham.
[00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:01.860]   But first, I want to talk a little bit about stamps.com.
[00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:05.140]   Speaking of federal, you can buy your own postage, print your own postage.
[00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:09.420]   There are people who probably think that's going to go to jail like if you printed your
[00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:10.420]   own money.
[00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:14.340]   But no, you can actually use your computer and your printer without special links, without
[00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:15.340]   a postage meter.
[00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:16.340]   You can actually print stamps.
[00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:18.780]   I did it-- I've got-- I did it the other day.
[00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:21.060]   I've got my envelope in the other room.
[00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:25.980]   It's so cool because we use stamps.com.
[00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:26.980]   Stamps.com.
[00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:28.700]   I want you to check it out at stamps.com.
[00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:29.900]   It's Windows or Mac.
[00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:31.940]   It lets you print your own postage.
[00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:34.100]   It lets you basically bring the post office to your desk.
[00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:37.660]   You never have to go to the post office again.
[00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:38.900]   You print the postage.
[00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:40.220]   You put it on a package or envelope.
[00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:41.940]   You could postcard anything.
[00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:45.740]   They've even got-- and they'll give it to you for free while shipping and handling.
[00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:46.740]   A scale.
[00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:49.100]   It's a USB scale that you pop it on there.
[00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:52.460]   The software sees the scale, says exactly what the postage just prints it out.
[00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:55.180]   If you're mailing internationally, I'm sure, oh, when you want to send a letter to your
[00:21:55.180 --> 00:22:00.460]   mom, it's a pain to mail something to India because you've got to go to the post office
[00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:02.940]   and get international stamps and fill out for them.
[00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:04.700]   This does that all automatically.
[00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:06.460]   You don't have to go to the post office.
[00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:10.540]   You've got discounts that post office cannot offer, will not offer, on Express Mail and
[00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:16.260]   Priority Mail up to 21% on Express Mail, 15% on Priority Mail.
[00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:19.060]   You don't even have to go to the post office with the packages that come and get it.
[00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:21.860]   The mail-- you just call them or did the mail carrier on his regular rounds will come
[00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:22.860]   and get it.
[00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:24.100]   It's a pretty good deal.
[00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:25.100]   I've got to say now.
[00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:29.860]   Here's the special offer, one month trial, and they've thrown in some sweeteners to make
[00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:32.020]   this good.
[00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:35.180]   You've got to do this right because normally it's an $80 offer.
[00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:36.460]   You see that $110 offer?
[00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:40.900]   The way you get there is by clicking that retro radio microphone in the corner as seen
[00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:42.300]   in the Hunger Games.
[00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:43.300]   Click that.
[00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:45.060]   Even hit for the kids.
[00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:47.580]   That's just for the kids.
[00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:48.580]   Yeah.
[00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:53.220]   You know that the Hunger Games microphone, click that one.
[00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:57.900]   Then enter the offer code TWIT and you'll go right here to this page that I'm seeing.
[00:22:57.900 --> 00:22:59.620]   You get $55 in postage coupons.
[00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:01.460]   I got to tell you, people say, "Wait a minute.
[00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:02.460]   That's not all at once."
[00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:03.460]   No, not all at once.
[00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:05.940]   They spread it out over four or five months.
[00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:08.140]   It's not like you're going to give you $55 in postage.
[00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:10.020]   It's just bring it out, but it is free.
[00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:12.580]   You get the digital scale for free, you pay shipping and handling, you get the supplies
[00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:15.580]   and you get the four-week trial.
[00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:16.860]   This is such a great trial offer.
[00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:18.020]   I want you to do it.
[00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:21.460]   I promise you will never go back to go into the post office again.
[00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:22.460]   Stamps.com.
[00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:25.220]   Offer code for this is TWIT.
[00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:30.020]   Make sure you click the Hunger microphone in the upper right hand corner.
[00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:31.940]   Be like Katniss, kids.
[00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:33.420]   Get your stamps at Stamps.com.
[00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:35.860]   You know, this is a whole new approach I never even thought of.
[00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:36.860]   There we go.
[00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:38.380]   We need you to appeal to the U.
[00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:41.300]   Finally, we can click to a younger demo.
[00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:42.660]   We've got to get the U.
[00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:45.820]   The weasily guy with the odd looking beard.
[00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:47.580]   Apparently, the kids love.
[00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:48.580]   So the FBI...
[00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:49.580]   Thank you.
[00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:50.580]   Thank you.
[00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:51.580]   Yes.
[00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:57.820]   I'm going to try to do this in an unbiased way.
[00:23:57.820 --> 00:23:58.820]   Yes.
[00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:01.500]   And then get your opinion on what you think of this.
[00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:03.980]   I have an interesting story to tell you when you're done with this.
[00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:05.420]   So you know where I'm going on this.
[00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:07.100]   You know where I'm going on this.
[00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:14.540]   So in November, the FBI in conjunction with Estonian police arrested this wild group of
[00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:21.060]   people, these Estonian virus authors, that had been since 2007.
[00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:27.140]   They're putting malware out called DNS changer that would infect computers that over, I
[00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:30.060]   think, 4 million computers over the five year period.
[00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:33.820]   And what it would do, among other things, it would change your DNS settings so that
[00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:39.500]   you would go through their malicious DNS server and they would do things like inject
[00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:41.540]   ads into your web pages.
[00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:46.820]   Apparently they made $4 million on these injected ads over the five.
[00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:48.740]   Was it 4 million or more than that, actually?
[00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:49.740]   It was several million dollars.
[00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:55.180]   You know, it's $14 million over that period of time.
[00:24:55.180 --> 00:24:56.180]   Really?
[00:24:56.180 --> 00:25:00.300]   They would also, but they'd sometimes they send you to spam sites.
[00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:02.260]   And in fact, they could do other things.
[00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:05.460]   One among other things, what they did is they turned off antivirus updates and they turned
[00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:11.140]   off Windows updates so that if you had this malware on your system, very likely you'd
[00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:15.180]   get other malware because your system would never be updated or protected again.
[00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:20.860]   So when the FBI arrested these guys, and this is where I kind of get a little funny, I'm
[00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:28.260]   curious what you think, they went to the, the ICS and they said, would you take over
[00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:36.860]   the IP addresses for these servers and continue to serve proper domain name resolves through
[00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:38.980]   these servers?
[00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:40.460]   And so for what is it?
[00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:44.180]   Since November, even if you had this malware, your system worked.
[00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:46.260]   Well, this part of your system worked fine.
[00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:47.540]   You would got DNS worked.
[00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:51.820]   You didn't get any of the other stuff still happened, but you didn't, your DNS worked
[00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:52.820]   fine.
[00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:57.900]   Now the internet systems consortium says, well, it's cost us money.
[00:25:57.900 --> 00:26:00.500]   So we're going to turn these servers off on July 9th.
[00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:03.740]   And they put out a big press release and every newspaper in the country, and I bet the
[00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:08.020]   Houston Chronicle has this big story that says for hundreds of thousands of people,
[00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:11.100]   the internet will stop working July 9th.
[00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:12.260]   Why, what's what?
[00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:14.020]   So tell me your story.
[00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:19.580]   So this went up on our website, the front of our website on Friday night.
[00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:26.580]   And I started getting emails from readers who were, who were asking if our site had
[00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:32.180]   been hacked and a malicious story posted.
[00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:37.060]   And should they actually click on a link that takes them to an FBI site that will scan
[00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:40.060]   their computer?
[00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:41.580]   People were so freaked out about it.
[00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:42.580]   I didn't think they did that.
[00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:43.580]   They didn't believe it was real.
[00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:44.580]   It doesn't sound real.
[00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:45.580]   What was the effort?
[00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:46.580]   All right, go ahead.
[00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:47.580]   Right.
[00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:51.780]   So I, you know, I looked at the story and it's an Associated Press story.
[00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:54.260]   And you know, the writer is a real writer.
[00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:59.020]   And I, to be safe, I, and I got a little nervous, I clicked on it on my iPad and went
[00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:03.460]   over to the site and sure enough, my iPad was not infected.
[00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:04.940]   Of course not.
[00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:06.740]   And it is legit.
[00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:11.980]   But the way the site looks, the way the little, the way the whole theme of it sounds
[00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:13.900]   like a scam.
[00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:18.620]   And, and you would almost think if the FBI was, was going to do this, was going to, you know,
[00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:22.900]   essentially try to make sure that, that internet service continued for these people, that at
[00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:26.420]   least it would try to do it in a way that didn't look like a scam itself.
[00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:28.180]   Look at this very suspect.
[00:27:28.180 --> 00:27:32.980]   This is the FBI that first of all, this is the crappiest website I've ever seen.
[00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:34.860]   Look at the, look, they're not solving crimes.
[00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:39.380]   Even the text, even the text is aliased in the, in the Ted header.
[00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:42.980]   And this is the illustration that they give you.
[00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:48.780]   I haven't had a computer like that since 1998.
[00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:49.780]   Okay.
[00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:52.140]   And the guy with no face.
[00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:53.860]   He's got no face.
[00:27:53.860 --> 00:27:54.860]   So it happens.
[00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:56.900]   You click on malware, no face.
[00:27:56.900 --> 00:27:59.460]   This is the, your face off like Indiana Jones.
[00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:01.580]   This is the DNS changer working group.
[00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:05.940]   I don't know who these people are because they have a fix.
[00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:07.340]   They have a button, a big green button.
[00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:08.340]   You can check.
[00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:10.780]   This is, this is what they're telling people to do.
[00:28:10.780 --> 00:28:17.020]   Click this green button and then read this text and you'll know if you're fixed or not.
[00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:21.300]   The following table is a list of all the easy, are you infected sites?
[00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:25.260]   You're just encouraging people to do stupid stuff at this point, right?
[00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:30.220]   This is everything we've told people not to check your computer.
[00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:31.220]   Never.
[00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:34.580]   And then the, if you think you're infected, take this action.
[00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:35.580]   Yeah.
[00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:37.540]   Go get hitmanpro from surfright.nl.
[00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:38.540]   Oh, that sounds right.
[00:28:38.540 --> 00:28:40.980]   It actually is really good software.
[00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:42.540]   It's good software, but I'm sorry.
[00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:43.540]   It's good software.
[00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:44.540]   Yeah.
[00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:45.540]   But it sounds shady.
[00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:46.740]   Oh, McAfee stinger.
[00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:47.740]   That must be good.
[00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:50.260]   Well, I mean, if you're going to say something.
[00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:51.660]   But here's my question.
[00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:56.540]   It doesn't seem like in, on the face of it, the FBI is not really doing the right thing
[00:28:56.540 --> 00:28:58.620]   by keeping these servers alive.
[00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:02.220]   The thing that they should do is tell people how to get rid of this software.
[00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:06.380]   There's other larger issues because these people have this malware.
[00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:10.820]   They almost certainly have lots of other malware in their system that there's all other things
[00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:11.820]   going on.
[00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:16.940]   Why was the FBI, why do the FBI decide to use these phony servers and then decide to pull
[00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:17.980]   the plug July 9th?
[00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:21.420]   It doesn't sound right to me.
[00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:23.260]   It seems like liability on all ends.
[00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:27.100]   You know, they don't want to shut it down and then all of a sudden they're the ones in
[00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:28.980]   charge of the computer not working.
[00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:32.900]   And now it's, you know, the government sponsored blackout is the story.
[00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:36.900]   And then they try to keep it alive, they realize that it's costing them too much money.
[00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:40.220]   And now they're in a position where they have to do what they probably should have done
[00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:41.220]   at the beginning.
[00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:42.740]   They should never have done it in the first place.
[00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:44.020]   And who is this working group?
[00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:49.460]   And then, meanwhile, there's just really no effective way that they can communicate in
[00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:53.140]   a clear, open and honest way with the public.
[00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:55.980]   Everything is, you know, it's clunky on their website.
[00:29:55.980 --> 00:29:59.380]   They don't have a good enough surrogate to sort of explain this and clear plain language,
[00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:04.300]   which is why podcasts like this and sites that, you know, writers like Omen Dwight are
[00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:08.540]   important to explain this to the lay people, which are really the ones who are at most
[00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:12.460]   risk for this that already infected and have no idea what the hell's happening.
[00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:18.340]   Is this maybe a symptom of how broken security is and how almost impossible for a normal
[00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:19.820]   person to fit?
[00:30:19.820 --> 00:30:24.700]   I mean, look, anybody watching this show knows what to do and knows that these are okay
[00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:25.700]   and stuff.
[00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:30.140]   I just worry about normal people, you talk to some normal people recently.
[00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:31.140]   I just worry about it.
[00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:33.740]   We've got on a world tour to meet all the normal people in the world.
[00:30:33.740 --> 00:30:38.580]   I just worry about normal people and what they must think when they see this.
[00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:42.060]   And they're not getting the right information, by the way.
[00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:45.700]   Removing this malware is the tip of the iceberg.
[00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:48.140]   What they should have done was just turned it off at the beginning.
[00:30:48.140 --> 00:30:49.140]   Right.
[00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:53.260]   And once you turn it off and people don't have internet access, they'll seek to figure it
[00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:54.260]   out.
[00:30:54.260 --> 00:30:56.580]   And they'll get the malware removed from their system.
[00:30:56.580 --> 00:31:00.500]   In effect, what you did is you kept malware infected computers on the internet for an
[00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:01.500]   extra six months.
[00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:02.500]   Right.
[00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:03.500]   Exactly.
[00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:05.500]   I don't understand why they did that.
[00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:08.420]   It kind of sounds like the fast and the furious thing.
[00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:13.060]   Well, my only, my only, you know, the conspiracy, if I were to war record or Adam Curry, I'd
[00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:16.780]   say, well, they wanted people to go through their servers for a while.
[00:31:16.780 --> 00:31:21.060]   They were, they were up to something.
[00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:22.060]   What were they doing?
[00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:24.300]   Oh, do you have any thoughts on this?
[00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:25.300]   I actually don't.
[00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:27.340]   I'm just fascinated listening to you.
[00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:28.500]   Is this bizarre or what?
[00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:34.260]   I mean, I didn't even know about this until people started calling the radio show on Saturday
[00:31:34.260 --> 00:31:38.180]   saying, we saw this article just like you, Dwight, we saw this article.
[00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:39.580]   Now what do we do?
[00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:40.580]   What's going on?
[00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:41.820]   Is this real?
[00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:43.620]   I think they tried to play good guys.
[00:31:43.620 --> 00:31:46.660]   I mean, I think they were, you know, their heart was in the right place.
[00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:49.580]   They were saying, okay, we don't want these people to lose internet access, but they're
[00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:53.380]   not doing the many favors by allowing their infected machines to keep working.
[00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:56.180]   And then waiting till now to say, oh, by the way, we're going to turn off the internet
[00:31:56.180 --> 00:31:57.180]   in July.
[00:31:57.180 --> 00:31:58.180]   Right.
[00:31:58.180 --> 00:31:59.180]   Now the good news is-
[00:31:59.180 --> 00:32:00.180]   There's a long way to put it.
[00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:01.980]   You know, that's like, that's a really bad headline.
[00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:03.500]   Don't say you're going to turn off the internet.
[00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:06.940]   It's the worst possible headline because it completely misses the bank.
[00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:07.940]   Right.
[00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:08.940]   You are infected.
[00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:09.940]   If you are infected.
[00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:12.100]   Now, the, this is actually a fairly minor infection.
[00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:13.540]   Now there were 4 million computers.
[00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:15.340]   It's just a few hundred thousand.
[00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:20.300]   There are far bigger, even, you know, this Mac malware hit many more computers than
[00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:21.300]   that.
[00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:23.500]   So it's just very strange.
[00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:28.260]   I think a lot of people, millions of people are scared that should never have been worried.
[00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:31.380]   And the people who should be worried never got the information they should have gotten
[00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:32.380]   on the first.
[00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:37.060]   Well, also in a lot of cases, many of the infected machines like this, if people haven't
[00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:43.060]   been updating their systems and don't run, you know, antivirus virus, a lot of that stuff
[00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:49.860]   is on pirated saw, pirated machines running in China and in Eastern Europe.
[00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:54.260]   And so my suspicion is that a lot of the machines that are having their DNS properly
[00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:58.460]   redirected are not necessarily legitimate machines.
[00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:02.820]   There probably aren't that many in, you know, in people's homes.
[00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:06.340]   It's probably in, you know, so when they turn it off, it's not, it may not actually affect
[00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:08.300]   that, that, that many legitimate users.
[00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:14.260]   I just, I really think that there's a bad precedent set when the US government, because
[00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:16.820]   remember, this is an international problem.
[00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:21.940]   But when the US government kind of unilaterally decides to, well, you know what, we'll take
[00:33:21.940 --> 00:33:23.100]   over those servers.
[00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:25.740]   We'll run them for a little while.
[00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:27.060]   Don't worry about it.
[00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:29.180]   That really worries me.
[00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:33.220]   There's a little bit too much willingness in the federal government here in the United
[00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:39.020]   States to kind of intervene in a kind of blunt handed blunt way with the internet and started
[00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:40.020]   with soap.
[00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:42.220]   And this, this reminds me the same kind of attitude.
[00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:45.620]   Well, is there, is there a question of who else would do it?
[00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:46.620]   Nobody should do it.
[00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:48.700]   They should, they should do what Dwight said.
[00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:50.740]   They should arrest, they should arrest the people.
[00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:51.740]   Okay.
[00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:52.740]   Yeah.
[00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:57.300]   And shut down the botnet and move on and let the normal process happen.
[00:33:57.300 --> 00:34:03.020]   It bothers me that the FBI was handling these redirections for five months.
[00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:10.700]   It just seems it seems like people that are, that don't want to have a outcome that they
[00:34:10.700 --> 00:34:12.300]   can be blamed for happen.
[00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:13.900]   I think it's even worse.
[00:34:13.900 --> 00:34:14.900]   They wanted the pup.
[00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:16.300]   They wanted to look like the good guys.
[00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:17.300]   Right.
[00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:18.740]   Oh, we saved you.
[00:34:18.740 --> 00:34:22.820]   It is operation ghost click, which I think something they should have focused more on because
[00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:24.820]   it's a cool name.
[00:34:24.820 --> 00:34:25.820]   All right.
[00:34:25.820 --> 00:34:29.020]   I mean, I don't want to belabor it.
[00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:30.620]   It's just, there's something that bothered me.
[00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:33.220]   And I just, it bugged me a little bit.
[00:34:33.220 --> 00:34:37.260]   I'm coming this fall, starting Zach Efron ghost click.
[00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:38.620]   It is a good name.
[00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:43.140]   I bet you, I bet you Hollywood producers have already optioned that.
[00:34:43.140 --> 00:34:44.140]   Exactly.
[00:34:44.140 --> 00:34:47.940]   Michael Serum playing the leader of the Estonian hacker ring.
[00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:48.940]   Michael Serum.
[00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:51.860]   Anybody got a 25 year old actor?
[00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:52.860]   Oh, Michael Serum.
[00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:53.860]   Good.
[00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:54.860]   Yeah.
[00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:55.860]   Yeah.
[00:34:55.860 --> 00:34:56.860]   Estonian hacker.
[00:34:56.860 --> 00:34:57.860]   I'll buy it.
[00:34:57.860 --> 00:34:58.860]   Of course.
[00:34:58.860 --> 00:34:59.860]   Ryan Gosling.
[00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:00.860]   Oh, dude, totally.
[00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:04.740]   I mean, Chris Hemsworth.
[00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:07.300]   We have to solve it with no shit.
[00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:08.300]   Click.
[00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:09.940]   We were talking about Microsoft.
[00:35:09.940 --> 00:35:11.740]   One other story about the Lumia.
[00:35:11.740 --> 00:35:12.740]   We talked about the Lumia 9.
[00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:13.740]   I like this phone.
[00:35:13.740 --> 00:35:14.740]   I love the Lumia 900.
[00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:15.900]   A lot of positive buzz on it.
[00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:16.900]   It's a great phone.
[00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:21.540]   I don't understand why they decided to release it on Easter Sunday with all the stores are
[00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:22.540]   closed.
[00:35:22.540 --> 00:35:23.540]   But anyway, they did.
[00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:25.380]   Now, if that weren't bad enough, European chairs.
[00:35:25.380 --> 00:35:27.580]   They're chances for windows.
[00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:28.580]   Yeah.
[00:35:28.580 --> 00:35:31.180]   Now, the European carrier say, oh, these aren't.
[00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:33.020]   We're not going to.
[00:35:33.020 --> 00:35:34.020]   We don't want them.
[00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:39.340]   Well, now the buzz is that this was kind of the first foray, but the next generations
[00:35:39.340 --> 00:35:41.620]   of windows phones are going to be the real hotness.
[00:35:41.620 --> 00:35:44.260]   How many years is that?
[00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:45.860]   That was that going to work?
[00:35:45.860 --> 00:35:47.820]   That's Microsoft's business model.
[00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:50.340]   Next year, next year, it'll be great.
[00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:51.340]   Sure.
[00:35:51.340 --> 00:35:52.340]   This is the one that's got it.
[00:35:52.340 --> 00:35:53.660]   It's got to really hurt.
[00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:58.380]   One of the writers has been asking the four major European telecom operators.
[00:35:58.380 --> 00:36:02.420]   They say all four of them are dissatisfied with alumia handsets.
[00:36:02.420 --> 00:36:06.100]   One said, really, if the Lumia came with the same hardware that came with Android in
[00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:09.420]   it and not Windows, it'd be much easier to sell.
[00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:14.460]   It's just like, why is anybody surprised?
[00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:15.460]   Why are these carriers surprised?
[00:36:15.460 --> 00:36:18.660]   I don't know what the hell they were doing these years.
[00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:19.740]   They can't predict.
[00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:21.660]   I think it's because it was Nokia, don't you?
[00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:27.020]   That they thought, oh, I just think the phone companies have this sense of delusion and they
[00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:30.460]   don't really understand their own customers, it seems like.
[00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:31.620]   Well, there is a reason.
[00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:34.700]   If you look at the data, people want to buy two kinds of phones.
[00:36:34.700 --> 00:36:40.260]   One is Android phones and other people want to buy the iPhone.
[00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:44.900]   And just to kind of jam another operating system on these people is going to be really
[00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:45.900]   tough.
[00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:51.020]   So the Windows phone doesn't do anything different over you.
[00:36:51.020 --> 00:36:52.460]   And that's the problem.
[00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:58.140]   You can't stand out, just the tiles are not enough for it to stand out.
[00:36:58.140 --> 00:36:59.580]   That's the key thing.
[00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:01.580]   It is, oh, we can be the third option.
[00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:04.020]   Well, why do you need three options at night?
[00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:05.020]   Right.
[00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:06.220]   I can just be two.
[00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:10.780]   There's nobody fleeing iPhone and Android saying, oh, help us, help us.
[00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:11.780]   What is the third option?
[00:37:11.780 --> 00:37:16.620]   Well, I mean, if it was viable, if it was good, I think that, you know, there's only
[00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:17.620]   among geeks.
[00:37:17.620 --> 00:37:18.620]   You think so?
[00:37:18.620 --> 00:37:19.620]   Only among geeks.
[00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:20.620]   This is something.
[00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:23.060]   This is where you go to the real people.
[00:37:23.060 --> 00:37:25.580]   Real people are not saying, well, what's new and different?
[00:37:25.580 --> 00:37:26.580]   They're not.
[00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:27.660]   They're saying, I got something that works.
[00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:28.660]   I'm good.
[00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:29.660]   Thanks.
[00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:31.940]   Well, but the one that I understand, Android, I bought Android apps, I'm fine.
[00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:33.740]   I bought iPhone, I got a iPhone apps.
[00:37:33.740 --> 00:37:34.740]   I'm fine.
[00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:36.900]   They're not saying, oh, but there's something new in town.
[00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:38.540]   We say, oh, it's new.
[00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:39.540]   I got to try it.
[00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:43.060]   Well, the one thing I think that is a normal person selling point is the price.
[00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:48.500]   You know, the Lumia was a very cost effective phone and, you know, you could now get something
[00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:52.700]   that looks cool in your hand when you go to the phone store for a cheaper price.
[00:37:52.700 --> 00:37:56.900]   And I think it's a lot of the reason why Android saw a gigantic, you know, explosion
[00:37:56.900 --> 00:38:01.140]   because people who wanted something that looked like the iPhone, but is not as expensive
[00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:03.820]   as the iPhone and a lot of the same apps, a lot of the same functionality.
[00:38:03.820 --> 00:38:05.740]   But you could get a 3GS for a hundred bucks.
[00:38:05.740 --> 00:38:08.500]   You can get Android phones for $50 or free.
[00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:11.300]   So I don't even think they would win on price anymore.
[00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:12.300]   Yeah.
[00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:14.020]   You get what you pay for as an injury.
[00:38:14.020 --> 00:38:15.020]   That's what it is.
[00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:16.020]   Yeah.
[00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:21.660]   So I think the big thing with the phones is that people see their friends and family carry
[00:38:21.660 --> 00:38:23.780]   an iPhone, but they don't.
[00:38:23.780 --> 00:38:27.140]   So they want an iPhone, just to the herd mentality.
[00:38:27.140 --> 00:38:29.380]   People see their friends use Android.
[00:38:29.380 --> 00:38:30.860]   They want to buy a Samsung.
[00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:33.820]   Essentially, that's how people normally behave.
[00:38:33.820 --> 00:38:36.340]   That's how fashion trends start.
[00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:40.980]   Like suddenly everybody's wearing, you know, skinny jeans or, you know, belly bar.
[00:38:40.980 --> 00:38:41.980]   Not me.
[00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:42.980]   Wow.
[00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:43.980]   You don't want to see me.
[00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:46.860]   I will say this.
[00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:50.460]   And what I like to do with TWEET is bring in original reporting.
[00:38:50.460 --> 00:38:51.460]   Thank you.
[00:38:51.460 --> 00:38:54.780]   And finally, we're breaking news here on the way.
[00:38:54.780 --> 00:39:00.980]   Well, I've received, I can't name my source, but I've heard that Brian Brushwood's mom
[00:39:00.980 --> 00:39:05.700]   has fed up with both iOS and Android and longs for a simpler phone.
[00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:07.100]   That's where they had an option.
[00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:08.260]   I think an opportunity.
[00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:13.140]   And that if there were a simpler option, maybe that is the third way, is something that
[00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:15.940]   isn't as complicated as iOS and Android.
[00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:17.460]   It's not that simple.
[00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:23.460]   It's also important to keep in mind that only about, well, we just crossed the 50% mark in
[00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:25.180]   penetration of smartphones.
[00:39:25.180 --> 00:39:26.180]   So there's another 50% out.
[00:39:26.180 --> 00:39:30.020]   So you're saying we're halfway in, we're halfway in.
[00:39:30.020 --> 00:39:34.460]   And of course, I don't think it'll ever be 100%, but, you know, Microsoft sees an opportunity
[00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:35.460]   there.
[00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:39.380]   I think Microsoft also believes, and I'm not sure that I agree with it, that there's this
[00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:47.060]   longing to have an end-to-end experience from this phone to your desktop to the tablet.
[00:39:47.060 --> 00:39:48.620]   And that's, we go back to Windows 8.
[00:39:48.620 --> 00:39:50.660]   That's why Windows 8 looks like it does.
[00:39:50.660 --> 00:39:55.900]   And in fact, developers who write software for Windows Phone can just tweak the code a
[00:39:55.900 --> 00:39:59.300]   little bit and it runs on Metro, on the Metro UI.
[00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:03.820]   So they're trying to kind of get back to that holy grail that they initially tried
[00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:10.460]   to get to with their original Windows, what was their Windows mobile and Windows CE or
[00:40:10.460 --> 00:40:12.100]   Wnts.
[00:40:12.100 --> 00:40:17.700]   And they're trying to get back to that holy grail of making one operating system that
[00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:18.700]   crosses over it.
[00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:20.540]   I don't think they'll do it.
[00:40:20.540 --> 00:40:26.060]   But they think that the simplicity of it, the live tiles out on the home screen, being
[00:40:26.060 --> 00:40:30.220]   able to see your Facebook notifications and everything out on the home screen is simpler
[00:40:30.220 --> 00:40:34.340]   and is different enough that people will flock to it.
[00:40:34.340 --> 00:40:39.580]   I don't know that that's true, but that's their strategy and that's what they're thinking.
[00:40:39.580 --> 00:40:41.580]   Well, I hope they succeed, right?
[00:40:41.580 --> 00:40:43.900]   Like the world needs more competition.
[00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:46.340]   So I don't want to take that away.
[00:40:46.340 --> 00:40:49.580]   But the current product is just not there yet.
[00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:53.220]   Like, they definitely have their work cut out in the fact that-
[00:40:53.220 --> 00:40:54.940]   It's an almost product, yeah.
[00:40:54.940 --> 00:40:55.940]   Yeah.
[00:40:55.940 --> 00:41:04.180]   But both, you look at Microsoft's problem is that it's always willing to put products
[00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:07.500]   out in the market which are not fully done.
[00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:12.460]   They should have been calling this the Skype phone.
[00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:14.340]   Are they all smart?
[00:41:14.340 --> 00:41:16.060]   Just call it the damn Skype phone.
[00:41:16.060 --> 00:41:17.060]   They own Skype.
[00:41:17.060 --> 00:41:19.020]   Yeah, and keep it simple.
[00:41:19.020 --> 00:41:20.740]   Don't make it very complicated.
[00:41:20.740 --> 00:41:25.260]   It makes Skype the linchpin of everything that phone does.
[00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:26.900]   Is that going to excite the carriers?
[00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:28.340]   Did you call it the Skype phone?
[00:41:28.340 --> 00:41:29.340]   That's a good point.
[00:41:29.340 --> 00:41:30.340]   The carriers might not like it.
[00:41:30.340 --> 00:41:33.940]   The carriers are making money from data plants, not from voice management.
[00:41:33.940 --> 00:41:34.940]   Right?
[00:41:34.940 --> 00:41:41.420]   So they're already losing SMS traffic to Facebook and an iMessage and things like that, the
[00:41:41.420 --> 00:41:43.300]   over-the-air services.
[00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:49.420]   So why not just build a carrier clause as Skype experience in which everybody's happy?
[00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:50.420]   Right?
[00:41:50.420 --> 00:41:58.540]   The carriers make money making intra, like going from Skype to landlines or other phones.
[00:41:58.540 --> 00:41:59.540]   You charge for that.
[00:41:59.540 --> 00:42:04.020]   You charge for international calls.
[00:42:04.020 --> 00:42:07.340]   They just needed to completely radical rethink here.
[00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:09.340]   I think they have a good asset in Skype.
[00:42:09.340 --> 00:42:10.660]   Skype has a brand presence.
[00:42:10.660 --> 00:42:16.780]   It is a smart product even though the UI is currently very bad.
[00:42:16.780 --> 00:42:20.420]   But still, they can do a lot more.
[00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:22.380]   I think they did a good job with Zoom.
[00:42:22.380 --> 00:42:24.460]   They just were very late with it.
[00:42:24.460 --> 00:42:25.460]   I think this time...
[00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:28.460]   It wasn't good enough in the world where the iPod is dominant.
[00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:34.340]   And I think right now, at least with Skype, they can overcome the brand challenge.
[00:42:34.340 --> 00:42:41.500]   They can build a simpler experience as to the person who texted you guys.
[00:42:41.500 --> 00:42:46.500]   Of course, the irony of this home is that they didn't have Skype for Windows Phone.
[00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:47.500]   Until today.
[00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:51.260]   They didn't even have Skype until today.
[00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:53.860]   They just released Skype for Windows Phone.
[00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:57.260]   I really wonder who's in charge at Microsoft and what they're thinking.
[00:42:57.260 --> 00:43:01.300]   If there's one thing that they have succeeded at is that the Lumia and the Windows Phone
[00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:08.340]   so far have not shared or have similar names to condoms like the Android phones have.
[00:43:08.340 --> 00:43:09.340]   No, yeah, you saw that.
[00:43:09.340 --> 00:43:10.340]   That was funny.
[00:43:10.340 --> 00:43:11.340]   Yes.
[00:43:11.340 --> 00:43:13.340]   That was my buddy Steve Kovac at the...
[00:43:13.340 --> 00:43:14.340]   We actually played that game.
[00:43:14.340 --> 00:43:22.980]   We played that game last week and even Devorac couldn't figure it out.
[00:43:22.980 --> 00:43:26.020]   The ideas you give a name of a condom like Magnum.
[00:43:26.020 --> 00:43:28.820]   Yeah, we're a desire is the first one.
[00:43:28.820 --> 00:43:30.660]   Condom or Android phone or both?
[00:43:30.660 --> 00:43:32.420]   In fact, it's both.
[00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:33.420]   Yeah, both.
[00:43:33.420 --> 00:43:34.660]   I happen to know that one.
[00:43:34.660 --> 00:43:36.500]   The hero.
[00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:38.060]   Both.
[00:43:38.060 --> 00:43:39.700]   Only Android phone.
[00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:43.460]   Although now there's a marketing opportunity.
[00:43:43.460 --> 00:43:44.460]   The hero.
[00:43:44.460 --> 00:43:48.900]   I want a flip phone.
[00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:49.900]   That's...
[00:43:49.900 --> 00:43:50.900]   You know what?
[00:43:50.900 --> 00:43:51.900]   When I...
[00:43:51.900 --> 00:43:52.900]   You're a nice ones mom.
[00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:54.500]   When I hear people like Brian's mom say, "I want a simpler phone."
[00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:56.500]   What I really think is they want a flip phone.
[00:43:56.500 --> 00:43:57.500]   They want a...
[00:43:57.500 --> 00:43:58.500]   Yeah.
[00:43:58.500 --> 00:43:59.500]   They want a feature phone.
[00:43:59.500 --> 00:44:00.500]   They don't want a smartphone.
[00:44:00.500 --> 00:44:02.540]   You know where Microsoft, again, had an opportunity?
[00:44:02.540 --> 00:44:09.780]   The Kin was a perfect halfway between smartphone and flip phone.
[00:44:09.780 --> 00:44:11.260]   And that lasted like a week.
[00:44:11.260 --> 00:44:12.260]   Two weeks.
[00:44:12.260 --> 00:44:13.780]   Literally lasted a week.
[00:44:13.780 --> 00:44:16.060]   They didn't know how to market it at all.
[00:44:16.060 --> 00:44:19.900]   The problem is that we had none of the features of a smartphone, but it had all the price
[00:44:19.900 --> 00:44:20.900]   of a smartphone.
[00:44:20.900 --> 00:44:22.780]   They were charging data plans for it.
[00:44:22.780 --> 00:44:25.500]   But if they had not done that, it had messaging.
[00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:26.500]   It had...
[00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:27.500]   You know, there was a keyboard one.
[00:44:27.500 --> 00:44:28.500]   It had a cute little camera.
[00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:29.500]   It was cute.
[00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:33.260]   It did most of what people want who don't want a smartphone, but they want something more
[00:44:33.260 --> 00:44:34.820]   than a feature phone.
[00:44:34.820 --> 00:44:39.260]   It was originally designed as the replacement for the sidekick, the danger.
[00:44:39.260 --> 00:44:41.260]   They acquired Danger Inc.
[00:44:41.260 --> 00:44:42.260]   Right.
[00:44:42.260 --> 00:44:46.260]   It was originally designed as the replacement for that, but Windows Phone wasn't quite out
[00:44:46.260 --> 00:44:47.260]   yet.
[00:44:47.260 --> 00:44:48.260]   It wasn't ready.
[00:44:48.260 --> 00:44:53.500]   The Windows Phone 7, and so they released these and they marketed it completely terribly.
[00:44:53.500 --> 00:44:56.500]   I think Microsoft has a serious marketing problem.
[00:44:56.500 --> 00:45:00.460]   And you know, if they go back Windows 8, they can't market their way out of a paper bag
[00:45:00.460 --> 00:45:01.460]   anymore.
[00:45:01.460 --> 00:45:02.460]   It's not...
[00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:03.460]   Yeah.
[00:45:03.460 --> 00:45:04.460]   That's their problem.
[00:45:04.460 --> 00:45:05.460]   They spent a billion...
[00:45:05.460 --> 00:45:10.060]   According to Wikipedia, which never lies, a billion dollars to develop the Kin.
[00:45:10.060 --> 00:45:11.060]   Wow.
[00:45:11.060 --> 00:45:15.060]   They spent a billion dollars and they killed it in literally weeks.
[00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:20.020]   I mean, I remember the commercials were still airing after they killed it.
[00:45:20.020 --> 00:45:24.220]   I think these were exactly what people who don't want a smartphone wanted.
[00:45:24.220 --> 00:45:25.780]   They want color.
[00:45:25.780 --> 00:45:28.060]   I'm sure Microsoft is very comforted here.
[00:45:28.060 --> 00:45:29.780]   Well, I think this was a great product.
[00:45:29.780 --> 00:45:30.780]   I'm really disappointed.
[00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:33.100]   You know, one of the problems was the same problem they're having a little with Windows
[00:45:33.100 --> 00:45:35.700]   Phone is that the carriers wouldn't sell it.
[00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:37.260]   You could not get...
[00:45:37.260 --> 00:45:39.700]   They would say, "No, no, no, no, you want an iPhone."
[00:45:39.700 --> 00:45:40.700]   Or an Android.
[00:45:40.700 --> 00:45:46.700]   I mean, Android was rolling at the time that the Kin came out, right?
[00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:47.700]   Yeah.
[00:45:47.700 --> 00:45:50.100]   We're going to take a break, come back and talk about the next iPhone.
[00:45:50.100 --> 00:45:51.100]   Guess what?
[00:45:51.100 --> 00:45:53.100]   It's made of liquid metal.
[00:45:53.100 --> 00:45:54.100]   Yeah.
[00:45:54.100 --> 00:45:57.100]   But first...
[00:45:57.100 --> 00:45:58.100]   Yeah.
[00:45:58.100 --> 00:46:00.940]   Like the Terminator.
[00:46:00.940 --> 00:46:01.940]   That's right.
[00:46:01.940 --> 00:46:02.940]   Exactly.
[00:46:02.940 --> 00:46:05.700]   It's going to morph into Jason Patrick and ask you if you've seen this boy.
[00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:10.300]   It's kind of what lives like last year, right?
[00:46:10.300 --> 00:46:11.300]   Sure.
[00:46:11.300 --> 00:46:12.300]   You know, I was watching Blade Runner.
[00:46:12.300 --> 00:46:13.300]   That's 2019.
[00:46:13.300 --> 00:46:14.800]   We got to hurry.
[00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:17.420]   We don't have much time left.
[00:46:17.420 --> 00:46:20.780]   If we're going to build borgs, we better get going.
[00:46:20.780 --> 00:46:21.980]   I'll tell you one thing you can do.
[00:46:21.980 --> 00:46:25.820]   You can meet with people online really well.
[00:46:25.820 --> 00:46:28.100]   Go to meeting with HD faces.
[00:46:28.100 --> 00:46:30.780]   This, you know, okay, okay.
[00:46:30.780 --> 00:46:34.220]   This is technology that will transform your business.
[00:46:34.220 --> 00:46:39.500]   Because as everybody knows, when you meet face to face with people, that's why we use Skype.
[00:46:39.500 --> 00:46:40.500]   We use video.
[00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:44.140]   We want to see what people's faces look like, what their expressions look like.
[00:46:44.140 --> 00:46:47.820]   Now, here, if you could tie it into your meetings and go to meeting, of course, the best online
[00:46:47.820 --> 00:46:51.380]   meeting software with fantastic screen sharing.
[00:46:51.380 --> 00:46:52.380]   It's fast.
[00:46:52.380 --> 00:46:53.380]   It's secure.
[00:46:53.380 --> 00:46:54.380]   It's easy.
[00:46:54.380 --> 00:46:55.380]   And now they've added HD faces.
[00:46:55.380 --> 00:47:01.340]   So you actually see the faces of the people, your clients, your colleagues, as you're meeting
[00:47:01.340 --> 00:47:02.340]   with them.
[00:47:02.340 --> 00:47:07.100]   So the teams distributed all over the world, you can't always, you know, meet in person.
[00:47:07.100 --> 00:47:09.620]   This is so easy to join a meeting.
[00:47:09.620 --> 00:47:11.980]   So easy to start a meeting on your Mac or your PC.
[00:47:11.980 --> 00:47:15.580]   And now you can be in meetings with video and audio on your iPad.
[00:47:15.580 --> 00:47:17.060]   It'll use the iPad.
[00:47:17.060 --> 00:47:18.700]   This is, I'm going to pause this.
[00:47:18.700 --> 00:47:19.700]   That is so cool.
[00:47:19.700 --> 00:47:24.580]   You're using the iPads built in camera, built in screen.
[00:47:24.580 --> 00:47:27.980]   Even on the retina display, it looks fantastic.
[00:47:27.980 --> 00:47:29.340]   I think you got to try this right now.
[00:47:29.340 --> 00:47:30.340]   Look at that.
[00:47:30.340 --> 00:47:31.740]   Isn't that cool?
[00:47:31.740 --> 00:47:33.820]   Go to meeting with HD faces.
[00:47:33.820 --> 00:47:34.820]   Here's what you do.
[00:47:34.820 --> 00:47:35.820]   Visit go to meeting.com.

[00:47:57.300 --> 00:48:01.140]   Thank you, Citrix, the makers of Go to Meeting for your support.
[00:48:01.140 --> 00:48:02.140]   I do want an apology.
[00:48:02.140 --> 00:48:06.940]   It was Robert Patrick, not Jason Patrick, who played the T-1000 robot in Terminator 2.
[00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:09.500]   Yeah, I was immediately chastised by the chat room.
[00:48:09.500 --> 00:48:10.660]   They are so smart.
[00:48:10.660 --> 00:48:11.660]   They are.
[00:48:11.660 --> 00:48:12.660]   They're far smarter.
[00:48:12.660 --> 00:48:17.420]   It's almost like they're their own hyper intelligent Skynet force.
[00:48:17.420 --> 00:48:19.220]   The chat room is Skynet.
[00:48:19.220 --> 00:48:20.220]   There we go.
[00:48:20.220 --> 00:48:27.940]   I wouldn't be surprised.
[00:48:27.940 --> 00:48:30.460]   Okay, look, this comes from a Korean newspaper.
[00:48:30.460 --> 00:48:35.460]   But on Wednesday, they said the iPhone 5 is likely to be made out of liquid metal.
[00:48:35.460 --> 00:48:39.540]   Now, liquid metal is something actually that Apple has used before.
[00:48:39.540 --> 00:48:43.780]   You know the little thing that you poke the SIM card out with?
[00:48:43.780 --> 00:48:46.900]   That's made out of liquid metal.
[00:48:46.900 --> 00:48:49.500]   But now they can make a whole phone out of it.
[00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:51.100]   Now it's not really liquid.
[00:48:51.100 --> 00:48:52.100]   Yeah.
[00:48:52.100 --> 00:48:54.300]   But it is metal, right?
[00:48:54.300 --> 00:48:55.300]   One would assume.
[00:48:55.300 --> 00:48:56.300]   Sure.
[00:48:56.300 --> 00:48:58.820]   It's an alloy of get ready, folks.
[00:48:58.820 --> 00:49:02.900]   And please, if you're a mineralologist, or a metal, or just live with this because I'm
[00:49:02.900 --> 00:49:04.380]   going to do the best I can.
[00:49:04.380 --> 00:49:11.500]   An alloy of titanium, zirconium, nickel, copper, and other stuff that would make, it's the
[00:49:11.500 --> 00:49:13.060]   other stuff that's the, you know.
[00:49:13.060 --> 00:49:14.060]   Yeah.
[00:49:14.060 --> 00:49:16.460]   That's like why they make hot dogs out of it.
[00:49:16.460 --> 00:49:17.780]   Pig anus is actually.
[00:49:17.780 --> 00:49:22.540]   It would make the, all right, now it's out, the secret's out.
[00:49:22.540 --> 00:49:25.620]   It would, it would metal his people.
[00:49:25.620 --> 00:49:29.060]   It's made out of pig anus.
[00:49:29.060 --> 00:49:35.100]   But it does the surface of the phone is smooth like liquid.
[00:49:35.100 --> 00:49:39.540]   And you know, it is true if you're going to do that, that they say that Apple's doing
[00:49:39.540 --> 00:49:43.900]   this TikTok development cycle, where every other iPhone is a big upgrade because they
[00:49:43.900 --> 00:49:45.820]   want to give you the two years to get used to it.
[00:49:45.820 --> 00:49:50.300]   So the 3G, 3GS were pretty much the same in the four, boom.
[00:49:50.300 --> 00:49:53.180]   And then the four and the four is pretty much the same and then the five or whatever they
[00:49:53.180 --> 00:49:54.180]   call this next one.
[00:49:54.180 --> 00:49:55.180]   Yeah.
[00:49:55.180 --> 00:49:56.180]   That'll be a big one.
[00:49:56.180 --> 00:49:57.780]   And I call it iPhone like they called the new iPad.
[00:49:57.780 --> 00:49:59.340]   It's just iPhone.
[00:49:59.340 --> 00:50:00.340]   You don't need a number.
[00:50:00.340 --> 00:50:01.900]   It's so good.
[00:50:01.900 --> 00:50:06.580]   So high strength, high wear resistance against scratching and denting, strong, high strength
[00:50:06.580 --> 00:50:10.020]   to weight ratios is fairly lightweight.
[00:50:10.020 --> 00:50:12.700]   They basically make it like they would make plastic.
[00:50:12.700 --> 00:50:16.580]   They molded with injection molding, but yet you get metal.
[00:50:16.580 --> 00:50:17.580]   It sounds great.
[00:50:17.580 --> 00:50:19.860]   And Apple actually has used it before.
[00:50:19.860 --> 00:50:22.340]   They have some experience with it.
[00:50:22.340 --> 00:50:26.740]   I mean, this seems like the way that Apple does things.
[00:50:26.740 --> 00:50:33.020]   They build up a component advantage and they build up a manufacturing advantage and then
[00:50:33.020 --> 00:50:37.740]   try to leverage that against every other competitor.
[00:50:37.740 --> 00:50:41.180]   To me, the most exciting thing about this that we have yet to see is exactly what this
[00:50:41.180 --> 00:50:45.780]   does in terms of their capabilities to make the phone thinner and lighter.
[00:50:45.780 --> 00:50:50.220]   And if it gives it, if they can use less material to give it a strong quality build, maybe
[00:50:50.220 --> 00:50:55.940]   that changes the form factor in a significant way past what the four and the four S have
[00:50:55.940 --> 00:50:56.940]   been.
[00:50:56.940 --> 00:50:57.940]   It'd be cool.
[00:50:57.940 --> 00:50:59.340]   It'd be cool to have.
[00:50:59.340 --> 00:51:00.340]   Yeah.
[00:51:00.340 --> 00:51:01.980]   And apparently it's like a scratch resistant.
[00:51:01.980 --> 00:51:07.300]   It's more scratch resistant, which is a cool idea.
[00:51:07.300 --> 00:51:09.260]   Any thoughts anybody anybody wants anything?
[00:51:09.260 --> 00:51:10.260]   Anything at all?
[00:51:10.260 --> 00:51:11.260]   I didn't know.
[00:51:11.260 --> 00:51:14.460]   Just all that it's always a rumor with Apple.
[00:51:14.460 --> 00:51:17.140]   You never know what will happen with them.
[00:51:17.140 --> 00:51:18.780]   It could come out to be completely different.
[00:51:18.780 --> 00:51:20.660]   I know even though I report on this.
[00:51:20.660 --> 00:51:22.420]   But a Korean newspaper said it guides.
[00:51:22.420 --> 00:51:24.420]   Must be true.
[00:51:24.420 --> 00:51:28.980]   North or South.
[00:51:28.980 --> 00:51:35.220]   You know what I want is that material in Star Trek for the clear metal that they used
[00:51:35.220 --> 00:51:36.380]   to hold the whales?
[00:51:36.380 --> 00:51:39.260]   That's what I want from my phone.
[00:51:39.260 --> 00:51:42.980]   Isn't material, you know, actually jobs was kind of interest in this stuff because when
[00:51:42.980 --> 00:51:47.740]   they built the Fifth Avenue store, his original idea with the Apple store, I remember reading
[00:51:47.740 --> 00:51:51.780]   this in the biography, the Walter Isaac's in biography was no pains at all.
[00:51:51.780 --> 00:51:57.900]   He didn't want to just solid us literally, which is a terrible idea, a solid glass wall.
[00:51:57.900 --> 00:52:04.580]   And he pushed corning, I don't know who was, I presume it was corning to make it bigger
[00:52:04.580 --> 00:52:05.580]   and bigger.
[00:52:05.580 --> 00:52:06.580]   And they finally got bigger.
[00:52:06.580 --> 00:52:07.580]   They actually replaced the pains.
[00:52:07.580 --> 00:52:14.220]   Because even though everybody said this is dangerous, this is a terrible idea because
[00:52:14.220 --> 00:52:15.940]   he didn't want any bezel.
[00:52:15.940 --> 00:52:20.180]   So I could see, absolutely, I could see Steve Jobs saying, you know, we're going to create
[00:52:20.180 --> 00:52:22.260]   this, you know, we're going to get in vest heavily in this.
[00:52:22.260 --> 00:52:23.260]   We're going to make this happen.
[00:52:23.260 --> 00:52:28.060]   So when Tim Cook, you know, sees the shimmering figure of Steve, like at the end of Return
[00:52:28.060 --> 00:52:31.900]   of the Jedi and asks him what next, what now?
[00:52:31.900 --> 00:52:33.540]   Liquid metal.
[00:52:33.540 --> 00:52:35.300]   Liquid metal.
[00:52:35.300 --> 00:52:43.820]   Let's see, Facebook apparently, according to some, the IPO date has now been set for Facebook.
[00:52:43.820 --> 00:52:48.060]   It is, what is it, May 17th?
[00:52:48.060 --> 00:52:50.460]   Will the world change?
[00:52:50.460 --> 00:52:54.900]   I mean, that would be if we are, as we've seen with the Instagram acquisition, kind of
[00:52:54.900 --> 00:52:59.940]   moving into a new bubble period, wouldn't this be a great poetic symbolic kind of beginning
[00:52:59.940 --> 00:53:03.340]   period for, you know, any kind of new bubble?
[00:53:03.340 --> 00:53:09.740]   Hey, remember the Netscape IPO was what began the dot com ramp up and ramp down.
[00:53:09.740 --> 00:53:14.620]   And I think when you look at this billion dollar acquisition of Instagram, which apparently
[00:53:14.620 --> 00:53:18.500]   happened completely inside Zuckerberg's head, right?
[00:53:18.500 --> 00:53:19.500]   Yeah.
[00:53:19.500 --> 00:53:20.860]   He just rolled into the, I'm going to buy this.
[00:53:20.860 --> 00:53:24.700]   He rolled into the board and said, Hey, I'm 57% of the board.
[00:53:24.700 --> 00:53:25.700]   I vote yes.
[00:53:25.700 --> 00:53:29.340]   So it's, dude, I'm going to go get Wendy's.
[00:53:29.340 --> 00:53:34.340]   I mean, that's why he has that much, you know, cloud, right, do these kinds of, you can do
[00:53:34.340 --> 00:53:35.340]   it.
[00:53:35.340 --> 00:53:39.140]   Yeah, I think, you know, in many ways, people, people don't want to believe it, but most
[00:53:39.140 --> 00:53:46.020]   successful companies are essentially dictatorships, you know, look at, look at Apple was where
[00:53:46.020 --> 00:53:48.820]   when Bill Gates was around, you know, you don't want to commit it.
[00:53:48.820 --> 00:53:49.820]   You don't want to commit it.
[00:53:49.820 --> 00:53:52.380]   That's when you get with an RT.
[00:53:52.380 --> 00:53:57.700]   And you know, the founder always knows a thing or two about their business, right?
[00:53:57.700 --> 00:54:03.860]   Other than other people, people, he, the founder, he or she has the pulse of the business.
[00:54:03.860 --> 00:54:08.580]   You understand, just like you understand your kids better than anybody else is the same
[00:54:08.580 --> 00:54:09.580]   thing.
[00:54:09.580 --> 00:54:16.300]   And I think if, if Zuckerberg felt that he needed to, to have Instagram and, and basically
[00:54:16.300 --> 00:54:21.300]   make a big play for, for mobile and all these other things, which are happening around in
[00:54:21.300 --> 00:54:24.180]   the web, he needed to buy that.
[00:54:24.180 --> 00:54:29.820]   And if it took a billion dollars, so be it, because this essentially 70% of it is stock
[00:54:29.820 --> 00:54:32.220]   and to, you know, 300 million is in cash.
[00:54:32.220 --> 00:54:40.020]   So, but the reality of today's internet is that, you know, the, the one commodity you
[00:54:40.020 --> 00:54:43.940]   don't have as a successful big company is time.
[00:54:43.940 --> 00:54:49.900]   So if you lose the time advantage, you don't come back, look at Motorola, you know, still
[00:54:49.900 --> 00:54:55.700]   struggling, you look at, you know, Microsoft itself on mobile, still struggling, grim,
[00:54:55.700 --> 00:54:59.820]   because, you know, the, the market moves so much faster.
[00:54:59.820 --> 00:55:02.380]   Our world has gotten so much faster.
[00:55:02.380 --> 00:55:07.420]   So from that standpoint, I think you can, you, I mean, I'm not trying to, you know,
[00:55:07.420 --> 00:55:12.860]   either defend or denigrate the, the deal, but I think there is a certain different kind
[00:55:12.860 --> 00:55:17.420]   of action which is required to run a company in today's time.
[00:55:17.420 --> 00:55:20.820]   And I think Zuckerberg did absolutely the right thing.
[00:55:20.820 --> 00:55:23.740]   I think the other, the other thing is the IPO.
[00:55:23.740 --> 00:55:28.780]   And I wrote about this about six, seven months ago, and the news force came out.
[00:55:28.780 --> 00:55:36.120]   This is the, this is going to start an 18 month cycle of sustained, you know, investment
[00:55:36.120 --> 00:55:39.420]   activity and, you know, euphoria in the valley.
[00:55:39.420 --> 00:55:44.020]   But there's a lot of people who are going to make a lot of money from this, and they're
[00:55:44.020 --> 00:55:49.820]   going to leave Facebook and they're going to go become angel investors or do other things.
[00:55:49.820 --> 00:55:53.340]   And Facebook will have to replace those people with more people.
[00:55:53.340 --> 00:55:58.340]   So they will hire people at higher salaries or they'll start buying these tiny companies
[00:55:58.340 --> 00:56:00.060]   to fill out their ranks.
[00:56:00.060 --> 00:56:02.740]   And this is going to create a flywheel effect.
[00:56:02.740 --> 00:56:08.340]   So just it's pretty likely that you're going to see this thing escalate a little bit.
[00:56:08.340 --> 00:56:12.820]   You want to call it bubble or you want to call it, you know, euphoria or you want to
[00:56:12.820 --> 00:56:15.820]   call it whatever, it is, it is going to happen.
[00:56:15.820 --> 00:56:18.780]   I mean, it's like it's only a matter of time.
[00:56:18.780 --> 00:56:23.660]   And the IPO is just, just probably another, another marker for that.
[00:56:23.660 --> 00:56:25.820]   You find it as a crash inevitable.
[00:56:25.820 --> 00:56:28.260]   Is it a crash inevitable?
[00:56:28.260 --> 00:56:31.300]   Own on, in what sense?
[00:56:31.300 --> 00:56:36.180]   Well, you said it's going to escalate and you can call it a bubble or euphoria or whatever.
[00:56:36.180 --> 00:56:41.780]   The escalations is inevitable is a, is a crash at the end of it inevitable or can that be
[00:56:41.780 --> 00:56:42.780]   managed?
[00:56:42.780 --> 00:56:47.980]   I don't think, you know, it's pretty hard to predict what the future looks like.
[00:56:47.980 --> 00:56:53.740]   But once these things get a momentum of their own, then, you know, then they just go either
[00:56:53.740 --> 00:56:56.820]   they, I think most of the time they just go over the top.
[00:56:56.820 --> 00:57:02.780]   We had the same thing with, with the, with the, with the real estate market, right?
[00:57:02.780 --> 00:57:07.860]   Like must be somebody told somebody, Hey, I bought this house for a hundred thousand
[00:57:07.860 --> 00:57:12.220]   dollars and flipped it for 250. Look how much money I made.
[00:57:12.220 --> 00:57:15.260]   And next thing you know, everybody else is doing it.
[00:57:15.260 --> 00:57:16.500]   And it's the same thing.
[00:57:16.500 --> 00:57:22.620]   You don't know quite when, you know, how this will go, but there is definitely next 12
[00:57:22.620 --> 00:57:28.100]   months are going to be pretty, you know, hectic activity in Silicon Valley.
[00:57:28.100 --> 00:57:29.900]   That much I can tell you.
[00:57:29.900 --> 00:57:33.460]   Now I wish we had an economist on here because there's debate over bubbles and whether they're
[00:57:33.460 --> 00:57:35.300]   good or bad.
[00:57:35.300 --> 00:57:40.620]   There's, you know, one of the cases to be made for a bubble, you could point to the internet
[00:57:40.620 --> 00:57:47.820]   bubble of 1990s and ended in 2000 is that a lot of info, all of the money that was funneled
[00:57:47.820 --> 00:57:52.300]   from investors into the internet economy created a huge amount of infrastructure that
[00:57:52.300 --> 00:57:54.900]   this second wave took advantage of.
[00:57:54.900 --> 00:57:58.620]   So good advantage of things like fiber in the ground and so forth.
[00:57:58.620 --> 00:58:02.500]   And made it possible for us to be in this situation.
[00:58:02.500 --> 00:58:07.500]   I, you know, in what generally doesn't happen is while you may have some ramping up like
[00:58:07.500 --> 00:58:09.300]   this, you generally don't have a second bubble.
[00:58:09.300 --> 00:58:15.100]   I don't think right on the heels, of course, we're in the first bubble, unusual situation.
[00:58:15.100 --> 00:58:16.260]   You can be afraid of it, right?
[00:58:16.260 --> 00:58:18.900]   I mean, you have to keep going out there and innovating.
[00:58:18.900 --> 00:58:22.260]   And if people want to spend money and you're not going to stop them from spending money,
[00:58:22.260 --> 00:58:24.580]   we can chastise them and say they spent too much.
[00:58:24.580 --> 00:58:28.220]   But these innovations are going to happen.
[00:58:28.220 --> 00:58:33.460]   And if it pulls back at a certain point and we, you know, the bill comes due on dumb decisions
[00:58:33.460 --> 00:58:38.420]   as happened with real estate as happened with a lot of the spending in the late 90s
[00:58:38.420 --> 00:58:39.420]   and early 2000s.
[00:58:39.420 --> 00:58:40.420]   And then that happens.
[00:58:40.420 --> 00:58:41.420]   And then there's dislocations.
[00:58:41.420 --> 00:58:45.020]   I mean, there are million, you know, people who lost everything in the housing bubble.
[00:58:45.020 --> 00:58:51.100]   I'm sure talk commerce who, you know, had some bad outcomes from the calm bubble.
[00:58:51.100 --> 00:58:52.740]   So it's not all good, obviously.
[00:58:52.740 --> 00:58:56.420]   What's important is that the progress is made and we keep moving forward and we keep
[00:58:56.420 --> 00:58:57.420]   creating.
[00:58:57.420 --> 00:58:59.420]   And maybe we've learned a lesson.
[00:58:59.420 --> 00:59:02.620]   Maybe we won't have irrational exuberance this time around.
[00:59:02.620 --> 00:59:05.620]   Well, I think there's this head home.
[00:59:05.620 --> 00:59:06.820]   Sorry.
[00:59:06.820 --> 00:59:10.540]   I think the key, there are two things to remember, right?
[00:59:10.540 --> 00:59:16.620]   Like I was there during the 90s bubble and it was very different because we didn't really
[00:59:16.620 --> 00:59:19.260]   have a commercial internet base.
[00:59:19.260 --> 00:59:21.500]   Like we didn't really have that many people.
[00:59:21.500 --> 00:59:25.740]   All these things they used to talk about can really make a lot of sense because there
[00:59:25.740 --> 00:59:27.620]   wasn't a big enough market.
[00:59:27.620 --> 00:59:30.540]   Now you look at just, let's just look at mobile, right?
[00:59:30.540 --> 00:59:33.420]   Two years ago, Instagram didn't exist.
[00:59:33.420 --> 00:59:37.540]   And in less than two years, it had 30 million people using the service.
[00:59:37.540 --> 00:59:41.460]   A year ago, a company called Whitley didn't exist.
[00:59:41.460 --> 00:59:45.540]   And now it's number one video app on iOS, right?
[00:59:45.540 --> 00:59:49.340]   So the velocity of the internet has increased.
[00:59:49.340 --> 00:59:51.740]   So has the size and scope of it.
[00:59:51.740 --> 00:59:59.420]   So it's really hard to say whether this will become a bubble or it will be a normal situation
[00:59:59.420 --> 01:00:04.780]   because we don't quite know because this is all very, very new.
[01:00:04.780 --> 01:00:09.100]   The history can only teach us not to make mistakes, but we don't know what the future
[01:00:09.100 --> 01:00:12.100]   looks like because there's all new mistakes can be made.
[01:00:12.100 --> 01:00:13.100]   Absolutely.
[01:00:13.100 --> 01:00:16.140]   And the scale we are playing at is very different.
[01:00:16.140 --> 01:00:19.780]   The scale of the internet is so much bigger now.
[01:00:19.780 --> 01:00:25.980]   We have almost a billion people using wired connections to connect to the internet, almost
[01:00:25.980 --> 01:00:29.540]   a billion mobile internet connections.
[01:00:29.540 --> 01:00:33.140]   So that's a lot of people on the internet.
[01:00:33.140 --> 01:00:40.340]   And so that's why I hesitate to use the phrase bubble because I don't know.
[01:00:40.340 --> 01:00:46.580]   Does it feel like some of the things we saw in '99, do we see the same things?
[01:00:46.580 --> 01:00:47.580]   Absolutely.
[01:00:47.580 --> 01:00:48.580]   Is it the same thing?
[01:00:48.580 --> 01:00:50.460]   I can't tell.
[01:00:50.460 --> 01:00:57.220]   I could tell in '99 that things were not making sense because there wasn't a big enough market
[01:00:57.220 --> 01:01:04.380]   and everything was focused around the idea of investments and not building businesses.
[01:01:04.380 --> 01:01:10.300]   At least for now you see companies like Facebook trying to build a business and sizable business
[01:01:10.300 --> 01:01:11.380]   on top of that.
[01:01:11.380 --> 01:01:17.180]   But you do, I mean, I wonder what the outcome of something like a billion dollar acquisition
[01:01:17.180 --> 01:01:19.780]   of Instagram and that feels bubbly because Instagram had no revenue.
[01:01:19.780 --> 01:01:22.940]   Of course, you can't sell anything for a billion dollars if it has revenue because then it's
[01:01:22.940 --> 01:01:25.140]   apparent that it's not worth a billion dollars.
[01:01:25.140 --> 01:01:26.140]   Exactly.
[01:01:26.140 --> 01:01:35.300]   I think the key is I do believe the effect of Instagram deal is going to be more mainstream
[01:01:35.300 --> 01:01:41.620]   because the stories of Instagram have appeared many times in the New York Times, Rossie
[01:01:41.620 --> 01:01:47.220]   Jones, so many small papers, my mom was asking me, "So what does this Instagram do?"
[01:01:47.220 --> 01:01:49.860]   It's like, "Mom, why are you even bothering with such like this?"
[01:01:49.860 --> 01:01:52.100]   Because it's a billion with a billion.
[01:01:52.100 --> 01:01:55.860]   And I think the word of that, that's the scary part.
[01:01:55.860 --> 01:02:02.940]   It's sort of like the housing boom in Phoenix, in near Phoenix or in Sacramento where everybody
[01:02:02.940 --> 01:02:05.220]   else feels that it should be part of it.
[01:02:05.220 --> 01:02:08.300]   I think there is a risk to that happening.
[01:02:08.300 --> 01:02:13.260]   I think let's see, next couple of months are going to be interesting.
[01:02:13.260 --> 01:02:19.700]   Of course, analog of this was markcubinsellingbroadcast.com for a billion dollars to Yahoo
[01:02:19.700 --> 01:02:20.780]   in the last bubble.
[01:02:20.780 --> 01:02:25.500]   And that was pretty obviously Yahoo put it out of its misery shortly thereafter.
[01:02:25.500 --> 01:02:29.180]   So you can look forward to the Instagram founders buying the Minnesota Timmerwolves.
[01:02:29.180 --> 01:02:30.180]   That's what I figured.
[01:02:30.180 --> 01:02:36.540]   I think that we're going to see Kevin's system throwing a chair at a referee any day now.
[01:02:36.540 --> 01:02:39.660]   I think somebody's saying in the chair, they won the lottery.
[01:02:39.660 --> 01:02:40.660]   That's right.
[01:02:40.660 --> 01:02:41.660]   They won the lottery.
[01:02:41.660 --> 01:02:45.980]   What I think the concern is, does this then cause this kind of irrational exuberance among
[01:02:45.980 --> 01:02:50.500]   others who say, "Wow, if Instagram is worth a billion, what is Pinterest worth or what
[01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:56.980]   is Vidi worth or what is, you know, all these other companies that have no revenue?"
[01:02:56.980 --> 01:03:00.020]   Whereas I think when you look at Facebook, I think it's reasonable to say Facebook's
[01:03:00.020 --> 01:03:02.620]   worth, I don't know, they're saying it's going to be $100 billion.
[01:03:02.620 --> 01:03:03.620]   Facebook makes money.
[01:03:03.620 --> 01:03:05.460]   Facebook makes a lot of money.
[01:03:05.460 --> 01:03:06.460]   Yeah.
[01:03:06.460 --> 01:03:10.820]   And one of the concerns I think about the bubble is, is that these huge valuations are
[01:03:10.820 --> 01:03:16.820]   going to companies that don't appear to have any business model other than to get acquired.
[01:03:16.820 --> 01:03:19.540]   By the way, Mark Cuban got $6 billion for broadcast.
[01:03:19.540 --> 01:03:20.540]   There we go.
[01:03:20.540 --> 01:03:21.540]   So there's the difference.
[01:03:21.540 --> 01:03:24.180]   So do it five more times, Instagram guys, and then maybe we can then talk.
[01:03:24.180 --> 01:03:25.900]   We can buy a team.
[01:03:25.900 --> 01:03:27.780]   And that was in what, 1998?
[01:03:27.780 --> 01:03:29.620]   That was when a dollar was a dollar.
[01:03:29.620 --> 01:03:30.620]   Right.
[01:03:30.620 --> 01:03:31.620]   Right.
[01:03:31.620 --> 01:03:36.980]   I just don't think that it's sustainable and, you know, I agree with OAM, I think there's
[01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:43.500]   going to be an escalation, but it just doesn't seem to me that the lessons, you know, you
[01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:51.180]   could make an argument that Instagram is the pets.com of its day.
[01:03:51.180 --> 01:03:58.300]   But that said, it does have this 30 million user base.
[01:03:58.300 --> 01:04:01.740]   But every one of those users was already a Facebook user.
[01:04:01.740 --> 01:04:03.820]   I mean, they didn't gain any new users.
[01:04:03.820 --> 01:04:09.420]   Well, but I think what they did do is Facebook has been very good at trying to keep ahead
[01:04:09.420 --> 01:04:11.860]   of what the coming trend is.
[01:04:11.860 --> 01:04:14.820]   They don't want to be like Google where all of a sudden they find themselves 18 miles
[01:04:14.820 --> 01:04:18.740]   behind in social and they don't want to be like my space that, you know, found them,
[01:04:18.740 --> 01:04:23.300]   you know, we're napping when Facebook took them over, took them in terms of users and
[01:04:23.300 --> 01:04:24.300]   influence.
[01:04:24.300 --> 01:04:28.100]   So if they see mobiles, the future, if they see, we don't want to lose our,
[01:04:28.100 --> 01:04:33.060]   our stranglehold on when people think about taking pictures with their phones and posting
[01:04:33.060 --> 01:04:38.380]   them somewhere, then Instagram is a very important target for them.
[01:04:38.380 --> 01:04:42.980]   And if it had gone to, let's say Google, so they can fold it into Google+, that would
[01:04:42.980 --> 01:04:48.580]   have filled in a big hole for that competing social network where photo uploading is never
[01:04:48.580 --> 01:04:51.500]   done and it is really kind of non-existent.
[01:04:51.500 --> 01:04:56.020]   So I think it is, you know, it's them trying to stay relevant and trying to stay ahead
[01:04:56.020 --> 01:04:58.060]   of the, ahead of the game.
[01:04:58.060 --> 01:05:05.420]   By the way, there is a story in the New York Times this week, an essay in which basically,
[01:05:05.420 --> 01:05:12.460]   I forget who the author was, but it basically said that what, you know, forget about Facebook
[01:05:12.460 --> 01:05:17.460]   and forget about the acquisition of Instagram, there is something else percolating out there.
[01:05:17.460 --> 01:05:22.260]   The next new thing, Facebook was trying to grab for it in its purchase of Instagram,
[01:05:22.260 --> 01:05:26.340]   but mobile is, okay, we know about mobile.
[01:05:26.340 --> 01:05:27.860]   There's something else that's going to happen.
[01:05:27.860 --> 01:05:37.460]   It was a really telling essay, you know, presenting the idea that even this too shall be eclipsed.
[01:05:37.460 --> 01:05:43.380]   And Facebook may have understood that when it was, or Zuckerberg may have understood that
[01:05:43.380 --> 01:05:48.820]   as part of the purchase, but even this too will be over the hill at some point.
[01:05:48.820 --> 01:05:51.220]   I think that's, I think that that's the story of Silicon Valley.
[01:05:51.220 --> 01:05:52.700]   That's kind of what we're seeing here.
[01:05:52.700 --> 01:05:54.340]   It's a pattern that repeats.
[01:05:54.340 --> 01:05:56.540]   What was that line from Battlestar, Get Actica?
[01:05:56.540 --> 01:05:57.540]   All of this has happened before.
[01:05:57.540 --> 01:05:59.460]   And it will happen again.
[01:05:59.460 --> 01:06:01.140]   That's why we love it.
[01:06:01.140 --> 01:06:02.140]   Right.
[01:06:02.140 --> 01:06:03.140]   Right?
[01:06:03.140 --> 01:06:06.260]   I'm getting, getting beat up in the chat room for saying that Google Plus doesn't have
[01:06:06.260 --> 01:06:11.060]   a lot of pictures uploaded to it, but I'll tell you, I know, actually, anecdotally,
[01:06:11.060 --> 01:06:13.900]   like people, I mean, I'm not saying pictures aren't uploaded to Google Plus.
[01:06:13.900 --> 01:06:18.140]   I think socially, it's not the same as what a normal person chooses.
[01:06:18.140 --> 01:06:19.140]   Exactly.
[01:06:19.140 --> 01:06:21.300]   They don't choose Google because there's no API.
[01:06:21.300 --> 01:06:23.900]   You couldn't choose Google Plus unless you're using Google Plus.
[01:06:23.900 --> 01:06:24.900]   Yeah.
[01:06:24.900 --> 01:06:28.980]   And then, I'm going to go over for what people use, people use Instagram for, I'm just out.
[01:06:28.980 --> 01:06:29.980]   Here's what I'm eating.
[01:06:29.980 --> 01:06:31.380]   I had fun with my friends.
[01:06:31.380 --> 01:06:33.100]   I'm going to take a picture and I'm going to upload a picture.
[01:06:33.100 --> 01:06:37.260]   And as long as we're issuing corrections, there is such a thing as transparent aluminum.
[01:06:37.260 --> 01:06:38.260]   Aluminium.
[01:06:38.260 --> 01:06:40.020]   Aluminium is what it's called.
[01:06:40.020 --> 01:06:44.340]   It is, get ready for this aluminum or aluminium oxy nitride.
[01:06:44.340 --> 01:06:45.340]   Yeah.
[01:06:45.340 --> 01:06:46.340]   Alon.
[01:06:46.340 --> 01:06:51.380]   And they knock out, they knock out one of the, one of the things in the, one of the little
[01:06:51.380 --> 01:06:52.980]   chemical things in the middle.
[01:06:52.980 --> 01:06:53.980]   Nice.
[01:06:53.980 --> 01:06:55.980]   And it makes it transparent.
[01:06:55.980 --> 01:06:59.300]   Dude, that's what I want my phone to be made of.
[01:06:59.300 --> 01:07:00.300]   Yeah.
[01:07:00.300 --> 01:07:02.140]   A metal just paradise on this episode.
[01:07:02.140 --> 01:07:03.140]   Forguit metal.
[01:07:03.140 --> 01:07:06.420]   I want, look, I want, they're going to show a 50 caliber round.
[01:07:06.420 --> 01:07:07.620]   Oh, hell yeah.
[01:07:07.620 --> 01:07:10.220]   Through this Alon plate.
[01:07:10.220 --> 01:07:11.860]   This is from a make zine.com.
[01:07:11.860 --> 01:07:12.860]   Oh my God.
[01:07:12.860 --> 01:07:13.860]   This is going to be so awesome.
[01:07:13.860 --> 01:07:14.860]   Yeah.
[01:07:14.860 --> 01:07:15.860]   Boom.
[01:07:15.860 --> 01:07:16.860]   Boom.
[01:07:16.860 --> 01:07:19.060]   And look at it only slightly killed, killed, killed the guy.
[01:07:19.060 --> 01:07:20.060]   That's too bad.
[01:07:20.060 --> 01:07:22.060]   But it only just like a hot breath.
[01:07:22.060 --> 01:07:23.060]   Oh my God.
[01:07:23.060 --> 01:07:25.060]   We only used a dummy head.
[01:07:25.060 --> 01:07:27.260]   I don't know what I just saw there.
[01:07:27.260 --> 01:07:28.940]   We're having trouble with home.
[01:07:28.940 --> 01:07:30.940]   We'll get them back as quickly as we can.
[01:07:30.940 --> 01:07:31.940]   Oh no.
[01:07:31.940 --> 01:07:32.940]   Oh no.
[01:07:32.940 --> 01:07:33.940]   And the, the.
[01:07:33.940 --> 01:07:35.380]   Oh, Alex suffers technical setback.
[01:07:35.380 --> 01:07:37.900]   The IQ of this panel just went down 300 points.
[01:07:37.900 --> 01:07:38.900]   Damn.
[01:07:38.900 --> 01:07:40.180]   I hate it when that happens.
[01:07:40.180 --> 01:07:45.100]   Have you seen Google, the Google, this Earth day, you know, it is happy Earth day.
[01:07:45.100 --> 01:07:46.100]   It is.
[01:07:46.100 --> 01:07:48.980]   And they did, Google has nice show the Google Doodle.
[01:07:48.980 --> 01:07:50.140]   This is a nice little Google Doodle.
[01:07:50.140 --> 01:07:52.140]   They did a time lapse of a garden.
[01:07:52.140 --> 01:07:53.340]   Oh, look at that.
[01:07:53.340 --> 01:07:54.340]   It's blooming.
[01:07:54.340 --> 01:07:55.340]   It's be welcoming.
[01:07:55.340 --> 01:07:57.620]   You may be having.
[01:07:57.620 --> 01:07:59.060]   You can get primpo TV.
[01:07:59.060 --> 01:08:01.100]   So what do you mean clicking?
[01:08:01.100 --> 01:08:02.100]   What does it go to?
[01:08:02.100 --> 01:08:03.100]   Oh, that's a good question.
[01:08:03.100 --> 01:08:04.860]   Well, probably something like Earth goes to Earth day.
[01:08:04.860 --> 01:08:05.860]   Oh, just Earth day.
[01:08:05.860 --> 01:08:06.860]   Okay.
[01:08:06.860 --> 01:08:07.860]   Yeah.
[01:08:07.860 --> 01:08:08.860]   Earth day events from condoms to national mall concert.
[01:08:08.860 --> 01:08:11.660]   Once again, it's all about condoms.
[01:08:11.660 --> 01:08:12.660]   Surely.
[01:08:12.660 --> 01:08:13.660]   With Google.
[01:08:13.660 --> 01:08:15.300]   That's it.
[01:08:15.300 --> 01:08:16.580]   They're fascinated by that.
[01:08:16.580 --> 01:08:17.580]   They love it.
[01:08:17.580 --> 01:08:18.580]   They love it.
[01:08:18.580 --> 01:08:19.580]   Ah, man.
[01:08:19.580 --> 01:08:24.180]   We're going to talk about spring cleaning at Google, their adventure with James Cameron
[01:08:24.180 --> 01:08:25.180]   that they're planning on.
[01:08:25.180 --> 01:08:26.180]   Sure.
[01:08:26.180 --> 01:08:29.780]   I think they're going to need protection for that Oracle, that Oracle loss.
[01:08:29.780 --> 01:08:34.500]   And then was it Quentin Hardy's piece you were talking about in the New York Times?
[01:08:34.500 --> 01:08:36.340]   Don't be evil, but don't miss the train.
[01:08:36.340 --> 01:08:37.340]   Yeah.
[01:08:37.340 --> 01:08:38.580]   No, that's a good one too.
[01:08:38.580 --> 01:08:39.580]   We'll talk about that.
[01:08:39.580 --> 01:08:40.580]   Yeah, that is good.
[01:08:40.580 --> 01:08:41.580]   Yeah.
[01:08:41.580 --> 01:08:42.580]   Lots of good stuff.
[01:08:42.580 --> 01:08:45.620]   But first, ladies and gentlemen, a word from Fird.
[01:08:45.620 --> 01:08:47.900]   Do you know what I'm driving for?
[01:08:47.900 --> 01:08:48.900]   Do you?
[01:08:48.900 --> 01:08:49.900]   I should.
[01:08:49.900 --> 01:08:50.900]   You're out of--
[01:08:50.900 --> 01:08:51.900]   I'm dumb for not doing it.
[01:08:51.900 --> 01:08:52.900]   You're dumb.
[01:08:52.900 --> 01:08:53.900]   I fly myself every day.
[01:08:53.900 --> 01:08:58.140]   I drive a nice 2010 Mustang, a muscle car.
[01:08:58.140 --> 01:08:59.140]   You drive a Ford?
[01:08:59.140 --> 01:09:00.140]   Good.
[01:09:00.140 --> 01:09:01.140]   2001 Mustang.
[01:09:01.140 --> 01:09:03.500]   Oh, well, that's pretty good.
[01:09:03.500 --> 01:09:04.500]   That's nice.
[01:09:04.500 --> 01:09:07.500]   Yeah, it's my-- we're in the pony car club.
[01:09:07.500 --> 01:09:09.020]   We are in the pony car club.
[01:09:09.020 --> 01:09:13.740]   Let's go get Manny Petty's.
[01:09:13.740 --> 01:09:14.740]   You're much more--
[01:09:14.740 --> 01:09:16.580]   Skinny jeans for all.
[01:09:16.580 --> 01:09:20.820]   2001 is not exactly state of the art.
[01:09:20.820 --> 01:09:21.820]   No, but it's nice.
[01:09:21.820 --> 01:09:22.820]   But I love it.
[01:09:22.820 --> 01:09:24.300]   I like the new-- actually, I love the new Ford's.
[01:09:24.300 --> 01:09:29.100]   In fact, if you've looked at the new Mustangs at 2012 or 2013, I guess they are now Mustangs.
[01:09:29.100 --> 01:09:30.100]   Wow.
[01:09:30.100 --> 01:09:32.460]   They got the new engines in there, sweet.
[01:09:32.460 --> 01:09:38.060]   And they got this Ford Sync and the App Link, which you do not have in yours.
[01:09:38.060 --> 01:09:39.620]   And you really want.
[01:09:39.620 --> 01:09:43.620]   This is-- the idea Ford had was actually-- I think it's Alamo, Alex.
[01:09:43.620 --> 01:09:46.740]   Is that you really-- you want to fight distracted driving.
[01:09:46.740 --> 01:09:48.340]   Did you see the airplane pilot?
[01:09:48.340 --> 01:09:50.900]   They forgot to put the wheels down because they were texting?
[01:09:50.900 --> 01:09:51.460]   No.
[01:09:51.460 --> 01:09:52.780]   I didn't.
[01:09:52.780 --> 01:09:53.980]   Whoopsie doodle.
[01:09:53.980 --> 01:09:57.100]   This is in Australia, but still not a good thing.
[01:09:57.100 --> 01:10:00.940]   They've-- the guy's texting is a-- oh, crap.
[01:10:00.940 --> 01:10:01.740]   And they have a--
[01:10:01.740 --> 01:10:02.260]   Crikey.
[01:10:02.260 --> 01:10:03.060]   Crikey.
[01:10:03.060 --> 01:10:03.740]   Crikey, mate.
[01:10:03.740 --> 01:10:05.820]   It comes to a butt time in the landing gear.
[01:10:05.820 --> 01:10:06.940]   It comes to land.
[01:10:06.940 --> 01:10:08.180]   Pull up, pull up.
[01:10:08.180 --> 01:10:08.980]   So--
[01:10:08.980 --> 01:10:09.500]   LOL.
[01:10:09.500 --> 01:10:11.500]   Nothing happened bad.
[01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:13.380]   Nothing in the-- yeah, he texted.
[01:10:13.380 --> 01:10:14.380]   Oh, Crikey.
[01:10:14.380 --> 01:10:17.380]   I don't have a chain, mate.
[01:10:17.380 --> 01:10:19.500]   But he did pull up, so nobody was hurt.
[01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:20.660]   But--
[01:10:20.660 --> 01:10:21.740]   Thumb, OK?
[01:10:21.740 --> 01:10:23.140]   That's called distracted flying.
[01:10:23.140 --> 01:10:24.060]   Same thing in the car.
[01:10:24.060 --> 01:10:26.700]   You don't want your teenagers going to-- you want their hands on the wheel
[01:10:26.700 --> 01:10:27.300]   and the eyes on the road.
[01:10:27.300 --> 01:10:30.780]   But you know, they want to-- I watch it was terrifying when Abby was learning
[01:10:30.780 --> 01:10:34.420]   to drive a few years back because I'm watching she drive off.
[01:10:34.420 --> 01:10:36.660]   And as soon as she drove off, she'd get out of her iPod.
[01:10:36.660 --> 01:10:38.420]   And she'd be looking like this.
[01:10:38.420 --> 01:10:39.140]   Let's see.
[01:10:39.140 --> 01:10:40.660]   I got to find-- no.
[01:10:40.660 --> 01:10:43.380]   With the Ford Sync, you talk to your iPod or your iPhone.
[01:10:43.380 --> 01:10:46.220]   You tell it what to play, and it plays it.
[01:10:46.220 --> 01:10:46.660]   It's awesome.
[01:10:46.660 --> 01:10:48.180]   And now they've got this app link.
[01:10:48.180 --> 01:10:51.980]   So more and more developers are running apps for the iPhone, the Android phone,
[01:10:51.980 --> 01:10:54.940]   the Windows phone that you can talk to, which is so cool.
[01:10:54.940 --> 01:10:56.020]   Pandora is one.
[01:10:56.020 --> 01:10:58.460]   So you say play-- you know, play my-- what are the kids like today?
[01:10:58.460 --> 01:10:59.620]   T-Pain?
[01:10:59.620 --> 01:11:00.260]   Sure.
[01:11:00.260 --> 01:11:00.780]   Yeah.
[01:11:00.780 --> 01:11:01.860]   You can get a little--
[01:11:01.860 --> 01:11:03.140]   Rake.
[01:11:03.140 --> 01:11:03.460]   Yeah.
[01:11:03.460 --> 01:11:04.620]   Who's hot right now?
[01:11:04.620 --> 01:11:08.620]   I'm a fan of-- the Spinto Band is one of my favorite Pandora radio stations.
[01:11:08.620 --> 01:11:10.380]   This guy, Tupac Shaker?
[01:11:10.380 --> 01:11:10.880]   Yeah.
[01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:12.260]   He's hot.
[01:11:12.260 --> 01:11:14.100]   You pick the shakers, the shakers.
[01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:14.620]   The shakers.
[01:11:14.620 --> 01:11:15.140]   Love them.
[01:11:15.140 --> 01:11:15.820]   Candlestick makers.
[01:11:15.820 --> 01:11:16.300]   So--
[01:11:16.300 --> 01:11:17.660]   It's hologram and hot.
[01:11:17.660 --> 01:11:18.020]   Yeah.
[01:11:18.020 --> 01:11:19.220]   That was wild with Snoop Dogg.
[01:11:19.220 --> 01:11:20.580]   And now you see the meme.
[01:11:20.580 --> 01:11:23.300]   You put Snoop-- I'll show you that meme, the Snoop Dogg meme.
[01:11:23.300 --> 01:11:28.220]   But before I get to the Snoop 2 side track into this deep rat hole,
[01:11:28.220 --> 01:11:29.620]   let's talk about fours again.
[01:11:29.620 --> 01:11:31.780]   So you press the button, you say, pay my Tupac channel.
[01:11:31.780 --> 01:11:33.100]   And it'll play--
[01:11:33.100 --> 01:11:35.580]   it'll play the Tupac songs.
[01:11:35.580 --> 01:11:37.580]   And if you thumbs up, thumbs down, all of that stuff,
[01:11:37.580 --> 01:11:40.580]   you can see the five voice.
[01:11:40.580 --> 01:11:41.580]   They have iHeart Radio.
[01:11:41.580 --> 01:11:44.060]   So you can listen to radio stations, Stitcher, Slacker.
[01:11:44.060 --> 01:11:45.860]   So you can listen to podcasts like this one.
[01:11:45.860 --> 01:11:49.660]   They've got sync destinations, turn-by-turn directions, maps on your phone.
[01:11:49.660 --> 01:11:50.660]   And you talk to it.
[01:11:50.660 --> 01:11:53.300]   They even have a mobile app developers network for effect.
[01:11:53.300 --> 01:11:55.580]   If you're an app developer, you might want to check in.
[01:11:55.580 --> 01:11:57.380]   I bet you they get a little--
[01:11:57.380 --> 01:11:58.900]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:11:58.900 --> 01:12:00.740]   A little scratch there for anybody.
[01:12:00.740 --> 01:12:02.300]   Hey, little somebody up for it.
[01:12:02.300 --> 01:12:03.380]   Everybody's watching me.
[01:12:03.380 --> 01:12:06.180]   You're right in the left here for the Ford.
[01:12:06.180 --> 01:12:06.940]   Just making that up.
[01:12:06.940 --> 01:12:10.780]   I don't tell them I told you they would give you money.
[01:12:10.780 --> 01:12:11.460]   Because maybe not.
[01:12:11.460 --> 01:12:12.260]   Maybe they will, though.
[01:12:12.260 --> 01:12:13.260]   I would ask.
[01:12:13.260 --> 01:12:14.500]   Let's put it-- I would ask.
[01:12:14.500 --> 01:12:16.940]   Any insinuated offer of a kickback from Ford is completely
[01:12:16.940 --> 01:12:18.980]   the fabrication of Leela Port in the Twin Network.
[01:12:18.980 --> 01:12:20.340]   Kickback's such a loaded word.
[01:12:20.340 --> 01:12:22.180]   I wouldn't just kickback.
[01:12:22.180 --> 01:12:23.620]   That's not exactly the word--
[01:12:23.620 --> 01:12:25.860]   I mean, just maybe there's a little money on the table.
[01:12:25.860 --> 01:12:26.860]   That's a little--
[01:12:26.860 --> 01:12:27.360]   Is it?
[01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:28.180]   --filled in the back of the truck?
[01:12:28.180 --> 01:12:28.680]   It could be yours.
[01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:29.220]   It's $20 right there.
[01:12:29.220 --> 01:12:30.140]   That could be yours.
[01:12:30.140 --> 01:12:30.740]   It could be mine.
[01:12:30.740 --> 01:12:31.500]   It could be anybody's--
[01:12:31.500 --> 01:12:31.980]   Hey, what am I?
[01:12:31.980 --> 01:12:32.380]   Hey, I'm the mayor.
[01:12:32.380 --> 01:12:33.300]   I'm the mayor.
[01:12:33.300 --> 01:12:33.860]   Pick it up.
[01:12:33.860 --> 01:12:34.340]   Pick it up.
[01:12:34.340 --> 01:12:36.620]   Ford.com/technology, if you'd like to learn more.
[01:12:36.620 --> 01:12:38.260]   But the best thing to do-- and you should do this.
[01:12:38.260 --> 01:12:39.220]   You got an old Mustang.
[01:12:39.220 --> 01:12:42.140]   You need to go in and test drive a new Mustang.
[01:12:42.140 --> 01:12:44.980]   And when you do do it, you want to say, I want to see AppLink.
[01:12:44.980 --> 01:12:46.540]   Bring your smartphone, and they'll show you.
[01:12:46.540 --> 01:12:49.860]   They'll set it up so that AppLink is all using your phone.
[01:12:49.860 --> 01:12:50.860]   Your apps--
[01:12:50.860 --> 01:12:52.420]   very cool.
[01:12:52.420 --> 01:12:53.100]   Very cool.
[01:12:53.100 --> 01:12:53.780]   You got to try.
[01:12:53.780 --> 01:12:54.260]   Yeah.
[01:12:54.260 --> 01:12:54.620]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:54.620 --> 01:12:55.540]   That's really neat.
[01:12:55.540 --> 01:12:57.660]   What I'm excited about is the number of apps
[01:12:57.660 --> 01:13:01.060]   we're going to see as more and more people
[01:13:01.060 --> 01:13:02.660]   start developing apps that work with sync.
[01:13:02.660 --> 01:13:03.700]   I think it's a great idea.
[01:13:03.700 --> 01:13:07.140]   I mean, audio feedback is just--
[01:13:07.140 --> 01:13:09.300]   once you get used to it and talk to your car,
[01:13:09.300 --> 01:13:10.340]   it's like with the iPad now.
[01:13:10.340 --> 01:13:12.620]   I don't want to do email anymore because I dictate my email
[01:13:12.620 --> 01:13:13.860]   all the time on the iPad.
[01:13:13.860 --> 01:13:15.860]   And now when I sit down on the computer, I go, oh, I have to tie it.
[01:13:15.860 --> 01:13:16.860]   Yeah.
[01:13:16.860 --> 01:13:17.380]   Oh.
[01:13:17.380 --> 01:13:19.380]   Just your fingers are just like, why?
[01:13:19.380 --> 01:13:21.140]   I never thought that would happen.
[01:13:21.140 --> 01:13:22.620]   But really, it's really true.
[01:13:22.620 --> 01:13:23.940]   As soon as it gets good enough.
[01:13:23.940 --> 01:13:24.260]   Right.
[01:13:24.260 --> 01:13:28.980]   As soon as you can do it without hesitation, as long as Siri is up.
[01:13:28.980 --> 01:13:31.020]   Do you-- yeah, well, that's another problem.
[01:13:31.020 --> 01:13:33.340]   You dictate a paragraph and there it goes.
[01:13:33.340 --> 01:13:36.980]   And then it just blinks those stupid pink lights for 18 minutes.
[01:13:36.980 --> 01:13:37.980]   You're like, please--
[01:13:37.980 --> 01:13:40.380]   Do you own-- you said you use your iPad more and more.
[01:13:40.380 --> 01:13:42.580]   Do you use the dictation on the new iPad?
[01:13:42.580 --> 01:13:43.620]   I know I don't.
[01:13:43.620 --> 01:13:47.140]   It's really-- well, maybe because you have a little tiny bit
[01:13:47.140 --> 01:13:48.700]   of an accent.
[01:13:48.700 --> 01:13:50.100]   It might not do as well.
[01:13:50.100 --> 01:13:50.620]   I don't know.
[01:13:50.620 --> 01:13:51.660]   That's quite true.
[01:13:51.660 --> 01:13:54.820]   I've heard it doesn't do well with Scottish accents,
[01:13:54.820 --> 01:13:55.660]   particularly.
[01:13:55.660 --> 01:13:56.100]   Yeah.
[01:13:56.100 --> 01:13:58.140]   Siri is just not a nice person.
[01:13:58.140 --> 01:13:59.260]   She just does--
[01:13:59.260 --> 01:14:00.020]   Siri, it all serves this.
[01:14:00.020 --> 01:14:01.100]   Siri's going to stock up.
[01:14:01.100 --> 01:14:02.340]   It all serves this.
[01:14:02.340 --> 01:14:04.300]   Does Siri work well for you or no?
[01:14:04.300 --> 01:14:04.820]   No.
[01:14:04.820 --> 01:14:05.980]   It doesn't.
[01:14:05.980 --> 01:14:08.300]   No, just because of my accent.
[01:14:08.300 --> 01:14:09.900]   Really, that's interesting.
[01:14:09.900 --> 01:14:12.100]   I know Siri was a racist.
[01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:13.420]   The iPad is not Siri.
[01:14:13.420 --> 01:14:15.580]   The iPad is the dictation feature.
[01:14:15.580 --> 01:14:17.100]   But it is the same thing, isn't it?
[01:14:17.100 --> 01:14:18.700]   It's not very good.
[01:14:18.700 --> 01:14:22.620]   And I've also noticed that Dragon dictation on the iPhone,
[01:14:22.620 --> 01:14:25.140]   which I have an iPhone 4, so he's Dragon dictation,
[01:14:25.140 --> 01:14:27.260]   also is not as good as it used to be.
[01:14:27.260 --> 01:14:28.020]   What?
[01:14:28.020 --> 01:14:31.620]   The Siri problem is not a Siri problem.
[01:14:31.620 --> 01:14:36.660]   But if Dragon's servers, which are a citation service for Apple,
[01:14:36.660 --> 01:14:37.700]   are the problem.
[01:14:37.700 --> 01:14:38.220]   Wait a minute.
[01:14:38.220 --> 01:14:40.100]   Are you saying that when I dictate to Siri,
[01:14:40.100 --> 01:14:41.060]   it's not going to Apple.
[01:14:41.060 --> 01:14:42.620]   It's going to nuance?
[01:14:42.620 --> 01:14:43.100]   It uses--
[01:14:43.100 --> 01:14:44.460]   They're licensing technology.
[01:14:44.460 --> 01:14:45.140]   Yeah.
[01:14:45.140 --> 01:14:47.260]   But that's still Apple's servers.
[01:14:47.260 --> 01:14:47.420]   I would say.
[01:14:47.420 --> 01:14:48.820]   Is this?
[01:14:48.820 --> 01:14:49.140]   Is it?
[01:14:49.140 --> 01:14:50.300]   No one knows.
[01:14:50.300 --> 01:14:51.860]   It's a mystery.
[01:14:51.860 --> 01:14:54.460]   I just know that Dragon isn't working as well as it used to.
[01:14:54.460 --> 01:14:55.820]   And I have an iPad 3.
[01:14:55.820 --> 01:14:57.260]   I don't have a 4S.
[01:14:57.260 --> 01:15:02.020]   And the dictation capabilities on the iPad
[01:15:02.020 --> 01:15:05.980]   are not as good as the nuanced dictation
[01:15:05.980 --> 01:15:08.460]   used to be on the iPhone 4.
[01:15:08.460 --> 01:15:11.100]   So I just wonder if it's not a Dragon problem.
[01:15:11.100 --> 01:15:12.220]   Well, I think it's you.
[01:15:12.220 --> 01:15:13.740]   I think your accent's getting stronger,
[01:15:13.740 --> 01:15:15.740]   because I have to tell you, it works--
[01:15:15.740 --> 01:15:16.980]   Really, I'm not kidding.
[01:15:16.980 --> 01:15:18.260]   It works great for me.
[01:15:18.260 --> 01:15:19.140]   I literally--
[01:15:19.140 --> 01:15:20.380]   But when it's up, it's great.
[01:15:20.380 --> 01:15:20.900]   Right.
[01:15:20.900 --> 01:15:21.780]   It's when it's like--
[01:15:21.780 --> 01:15:23.300]   The only problem is it's not responsive.
[01:15:23.300 --> 01:15:24.660]   You're an idiot, and you can't--
[01:15:24.660 --> 01:15:25.580]   It's not even that.
[01:15:25.580 --> 01:15:26.940]   And then we're saying, I'm just--
[01:15:26.940 --> 01:15:28.220]   It's just like I'm trying really hard,
[01:15:28.220 --> 01:15:29.460]   but I can't help you right now.
[01:15:29.460 --> 01:15:29.980]   Yeah.
[01:15:29.980 --> 01:15:30.500]   Yeah.
[01:15:30.500 --> 01:15:31.820]   She's always unfailingly polite.
[01:15:31.820 --> 01:15:32.860]   It's passive aggressive.
[01:15:32.860 --> 01:15:33.860]   Doesn't mean I don't hate her.
[01:15:33.860 --> 01:15:35.900]   What it does is it gets the word drawing.
[01:15:35.900 --> 01:15:38.140]   And I've got a radio voice.
[01:15:38.140 --> 01:15:39.700]   So it should do pretty well with my voice.
[01:15:39.700 --> 01:15:41.340]   Got a little bit of a Scottish accent.
[01:15:41.340 --> 01:15:44.340]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:15:44.340 --> 01:15:45.620]   Now, that's East Texas.
[01:15:45.620 --> 01:15:46.980]   Oh, East Texas.
[01:15:46.980 --> 01:15:47.860]   Same thing.
[01:15:47.860 --> 01:15:48.740]   I-- you know what?
[01:15:48.740 --> 01:15:49.260]   It's so weird.
[01:15:49.260 --> 01:15:50.980]   In fact, didn't we just dictate something?
[01:15:50.980 --> 01:15:51.580]   Or were you--
[01:15:51.580 --> 01:15:52.500]   Yeah, you know, on past--
[01:15:52.500 --> 01:15:52.940]   And it was on past.
[01:15:52.940 --> 01:15:53.940]   On past.
[01:15:53.940 --> 01:15:54.340]   You dictated--
[01:15:54.340 --> 01:15:55.340]   And I said--
[01:15:55.340 --> 01:15:56.140]   And it worked great.
[01:15:56.140 --> 01:15:56.940]   Dirtbag.
[01:15:56.940 --> 01:15:57.500]   Dirtbag.
[01:15:57.500 --> 01:15:58.900]   It got dirtbag perfectly.
[01:15:58.900 --> 01:16:00.860]   So they capitalized it, which was bizarre.
[01:16:00.860 --> 01:16:02.460]   Sure.
[01:16:02.460 --> 01:16:06.380]   No, I said Wendy's Dirtbag Brother Wendell.
[01:16:06.380 --> 01:16:07.700]   And it got it perfectly.
[01:16:07.700 --> 01:16:07.980]   Boom.
[01:16:07.980 --> 01:16:08.820]   And that was Siri.
[01:16:08.820 --> 01:16:09.460]   That was Siri.
[01:16:09.460 --> 01:16:11.620]   Well, it was the dictation button.
[01:16:11.620 --> 01:16:12.900]   It was the dictation button.
[01:16:12.900 --> 01:16:13.580]   Yeah.
[01:16:13.580 --> 01:16:14.820]   So which is Siri?
[01:16:14.820 --> 01:16:15.900]   Well, that's the question.
[01:16:15.900 --> 01:16:17.100]   Is it Siri or not?
[01:16:17.100 --> 01:16:18.260]   Well, we don't know.
[01:16:18.260 --> 01:16:20.180]   What is in Siri is the question.
[01:16:20.180 --> 01:16:22.100]   Like you are interacting with what happens.
[01:16:22.100 --> 01:16:23.700]   On the phone, they would say it's Siri.
[01:16:23.700 --> 01:16:25.900]   But on the iPad, which is exactly the same,
[01:16:25.900 --> 01:16:26.740]   they say what?
[01:16:26.740 --> 01:16:28.020]   It's not.
[01:16:28.020 --> 01:16:28.980]   It's just dictation.
[01:16:28.980 --> 01:16:29.620]   It's just dictation.
[01:16:29.620 --> 01:16:30.100]   Well, I guess, yeah.
[01:16:30.100 --> 01:16:33.300]   No, Siri technically is just the personal assistant
[01:16:33.300 --> 01:16:34.380]   elements of the phone.
[01:16:34.380 --> 01:16:36.300]   So if you ask it for the weather, if you ask it for--
[01:16:36.300 --> 01:16:38.300]   It kind of reminds me of Jerry Pournell who
[01:16:38.300 --> 01:16:40.140]   always says how good Microsoft's handwriting
[01:16:40.140 --> 01:16:41.140]   recognition is.
[01:16:41.140 --> 01:16:42.540]   And then when we query him further--
[01:16:42.540 --> 01:16:44.300]   because it's terrible-- when we query him further,
[01:16:44.300 --> 01:16:46.900]   he says, well, it's probably because they designed it
[01:16:46.900 --> 01:16:48.580]   around my handwriting.
[01:16:48.580 --> 01:16:50.020]   Literally.
[01:16:50.020 --> 01:16:53.180]   He was the example handwriting that they used.
[01:16:53.180 --> 01:16:55.460]   So maybe they've been using my voice for Siri,
[01:16:55.460 --> 01:16:56.860]   because it works really good.
[01:16:56.860 --> 01:16:58.700]   Sure.
[01:16:58.700 --> 01:17:01.380]   Siri, I say.
[01:17:01.380 --> 01:17:04.700]   Well, you, Sam Jackson, and Sowy Deschanel, apparently,
[01:17:04.700 --> 01:17:06.340]   are the ones who really--
[01:17:06.340 --> 01:17:07.580]   She's so cute.
[01:17:07.580 --> 01:17:09.580]   Oh, she's just adorable, isn't she?
[01:17:09.580 --> 01:17:10.980]   She said dorkable is what we said.
[01:17:10.980 --> 01:17:12.380]   That's what the kids say.
[01:17:12.380 --> 01:17:13.220]   Kids say a dorkable.
[01:17:13.220 --> 01:17:15.260]   Say Hunger Games reference, a dorkable?
[01:17:15.260 --> 01:17:15.700]   Yeah, two.
[01:17:15.700 --> 01:17:17.780]   This demo is dropping by the minute.
[01:17:17.780 --> 01:17:19.540]   Trying to get him young.
[01:17:19.540 --> 01:17:20.140]   Get him young.
[01:17:20.140 --> 01:17:21.220]   You can keep him for life.
[01:17:21.220 --> 01:17:22.500]   Sure.
[01:17:22.500 --> 01:17:25.660]   I'm trying to build this network for you, Jerry,
[01:17:25.660 --> 01:17:27.740]   because I'm going to be dead in a couple of years anyway.
[01:17:27.740 --> 01:17:28.380]   Good Lord.
[01:17:28.380 --> 01:17:29.740]   So Chumby, speaking of dead.
[01:17:29.740 --> 01:17:36.380]   Chumby, which is just a really dark turn.
[01:17:36.380 --> 01:17:38.420]   Aw, I love Chumby.
[01:17:38.420 --> 01:17:42.060]   I love Chumby too, but frankly--
[01:17:42.060 --> 01:17:43.980]   But once you were done awing over it and Penny--
[01:17:43.980 --> 01:17:44.460]   That was it.
[01:17:44.460 --> 01:17:45.140]   Do you have one?
[01:17:45.140 --> 01:17:46.540]   That's it, right?
[01:17:46.540 --> 01:17:47.100]   I had one.
[01:17:47.100 --> 01:17:50.820]   I gave it to my daughter, and she loved it until she forgot
[01:17:50.820 --> 01:17:51.460]   about it.
[01:17:51.460 --> 01:17:51.980]   Right.
[01:17:51.980 --> 01:17:53.460]   I think that was the problem.
[01:17:53.460 --> 01:17:56.060]   It's in the closet with other Tamagotchis and things.
[01:17:56.060 --> 01:17:59.980]   You know what?
[01:17:59.980 --> 01:18:02.820]   I'm really curious if everybody has old Tamagotchi
[01:18:02.820 --> 01:18:06.140]   said of starving for 10 years and pull them out.
[01:18:06.140 --> 01:18:07.580]   And if you started to feed them again,
[01:18:07.580 --> 01:18:10.380]   if they'd come back to life, or if they're dead.
[01:18:10.380 --> 01:18:12.060]   No, now it's like pet cemetery.
[01:18:12.060 --> 01:18:13.100]   They come back evil.
[01:18:13.100 --> 01:18:16.740]   Ooh, evil Tamagotchi.
[01:18:16.740 --> 01:18:19.060]   This is what they're saying at Chumby.
[01:18:19.060 --> 01:18:20.740]   That's what everybody says.
[01:18:20.740 --> 01:18:23.220]   If somebody wanted to pick up where Chumby left off,
[01:18:23.220 --> 01:18:26.900]   they could buy the assets tomorrow, probably for not much
[01:18:26.900 --> 01:18:29.260]   money.
[01:18:29.260 --> 01:18:33.380]   Technicolor, apparently, has hired many of the Chumby
[01:18:33.380 --> 01:18:40.820]   employees to work on their own Smart TV project.
[01:18:40.820 --> 01:18:41.940]   That's kind of interesting.
[01:18:41.940 --> 01:18:44.700]   Well, that's a lovable Smart TV.
[01:18:44.700 --> 01:18:47.020]   They were trying to pivot Chumby.
[01:18:47.020 --> 01:18:47.500]   You know what?
[01:18:47.500 --> 01:18:48.540]   I bet you there's people listening
[01:18:48.540 --> 01:18:49.820]   don't know what a Chumby is.
[01:18:49.820 --> 01:18:50.380]   Yes.
[01:18:50.380 --> 01:18:53.260]   It's like a bean bag with a face.
[01:18:53.260 --> 01:18:53.740]   Right?
[01:18:53.740 --> 01:18:55.260]   Just what the world needs.
[01:18:55.260 --> 01:18:56.620]   It was like a little soft thing.
[01:18:56.620 --> 01:19:00.420]   It had a LCD screen in it.
[01:19:00.420 --> 01:19:02.980]   Not very good, not very big.
[01:19:02.980 --> 01:19:06.460]   And it would tell you what the weather was, or radio,
[01:19:06.460 --> 01:19:07.140]   or chug web sites.
[01:19:07.140 --> 01:19:07.540]   It was Linux.
[01:19:07.540 --> 01:19:09.860]   It was a little Linux operating system.
[01:19:09.860 --> 01:19:11.300]   It was Linux banks.
[01:19:11.300 --> 01:19:11.620]   Right.
[01:19:11.620 --> 01:19:12.300]   It was the Linux bag.
[01:19:12.300 --> 01:19:12.700]   You could keep it.
[01:19:12.700 --> 01:19:14.740]   Bunny Wong did the development.
[01:19:14.740 --> 01:19:16.340]   You program it on the web.
[01:19:16.340 --> 01:19:18.220]   And then what you put on on the web
[01:19:18.220 --> 01:19:20.820]   would show up on the bag.
[01:19:20.820 --> 01:19:22.740]   And later they did a version that wasn't a bag.
[01:19:22.740 --> 01:19:24.060]   It was kind of hard plastic.
[01:19:24.060 --> 01:19:25.580]   And you knew it was downhill from there
[01:19:25.580 --> 01:19:26.620]   when they got rid of the bag.
[01:19:26.620 --> 01:19:28.220]   Yeah.
[01:19:28.220 --> 01:19:28.820]   It's kind of sad.
[01:19:28.820 --> 01:19:29.420]   So apparently--
[01:19:29.420 --> 01:19:30.180]   It was a lovable--
[01:19:30.180 --> 01:19:30.820]   It was a lovable bag.
[01:19:30.820 --> 01:19:31.580]   It was cute.
[01:19:31.580 --> 01:19:33.300]   Apparently, over the last few years,
[01:19:33.300 --> 01:19:36.260]   Chumby was trying to pivot into a Smart TV platform.
[01:19:36.260 --> 01:19:40.140]   They had deals with LG and Best Buy.
[01:19:40.140 --> 01:19:44.660]   And Technicolor now hired most of those people.
[01:19:44.660 --> 01:19:45.900]   So there'll be something.
[01:19:45.900 --> 01:19:47.540]   There's some kind of--
[01:19:47.540 --> 01:19:48.540]   There's the Chumby site.
[01:19:48.540 --> 01:19:50.860]   You know, I bet I'm a 12 successor for Chumby.
[01:19:50.860 --> 01:19:54.420]   I bet I still have an account there.
[01:19:54.420 --> 01:19:55.180]   I should--
[01:19:55.180 --> 01:19:55.540]   Like the first.
[01:19:55.540 --> 01:19:57.100]   I mean, you have an account for everything, right?
[01:19:57.100 --> 01:19:57.540]   I do.
[01:19:57.540 --> 01:19:58.180]   That's your gig.
[01:19:58.180 --> 01:19:59.020]   That's your deal.
[01:19:59.020 --> 01:19:59.860]   That's my gig.
[01:19:59.860 --> 01:20:01.260]   That's your bit.
[01:20:01.260 --> 01:20:02.460]   My bit.
[01:20:02.460 --> 01:20:04.060]   The first thing when a new site happens,
[01:20:04.060 --> 01:20:05.340]   I immediately get Leo.
[01:20:05.340 --> 01:20:06.620]   Boom.
[01:20:06.620 --> 01:20:09.740]   I'm like the guy who registered 15,000 domain names
[01:20:09.740 --> 01:20:10.900]   in 24 hours.
[01:20:10.900 --> 01:20:11.500]   You see that one?
[01:20:11.500 --> 01:20:12.900]   No.
[01:20:12.900 --> 01:20:13.460]   This guy.
[01:20:13.460 --> 01:20:14.580]   This is the guy you want to know.
[01:20:14.580 --> 01:20:17.060]   Mike Mann, M-A-N-N, is his name.
[01:20:17.060 --> 01:20:19.340]   He is the king of internet squatters.
[01:20:19.340 --> 01:20:20.460]   Look at that face.
[01:20:20.460 --> 01:20:21.540]   Memorize that face.
[01:20:21.540 --> 01:20:23.220]   Apparently in a bar where someone's
[01:20:23.220 --> 01:20:26.380]   wearing a Java Chamberlain, Yankees jersey.
[01:20:26.380 --> 01:20:27.980]   Yeah, so maybe he's in New York.
[01:20:27.980 --> 01:20:28.660]   Maybe.
[01:20:28.660 --> 01:20:30.420]   It looks like he has a bathrobe on.
[01:20:30.420 --> 01:20:31.460]   Is that a bathrobe?
[01:20:31.460 --> 01:20:33.020]   Yeah, he doesn't get up.
[01:20:33.020 --> 01:20:34.780]   He does have a bar in his house.
[01:20:34.780 --> 01:20:38.580]   He looks like a-- like a D-bag version of the dude
[01:20:38.580 --> 01:20:40.300]   from the big Lebowski.
[01:20:40.300 --> 01:20:41.300]   He does.
[01:20:41.300 --> 01:20:44.420]   He's wearing sunglasses and a dark bar.
[01:20:44.420 --> 01:20:46.620]   And he's smoking a cigarette, which he doesn't apparently do.
[01:20:46.620 --> 01:20:49.300]   He was quick to say, lives in Delaware.
[01:20:49.300 --> 01:20:53.340]   He founded an ISP there called Internet Interstate.
[01:20:53.340 --> 01:20:55.620]   And he owned just by chance, menus.com,
[01:20:55.620 --> 01:20:57.220]   got offered 50 grand for it.
[01:20:57.220 --> 01:21:00.180]   And he said, whoa, wait a minute.
[01:21:00.180 --> 01:21:03.380]   There's money in being an impediment to progress.
[01:21:03.380 --> 01:21:04.140]   So--
[01:21:04.140 --> 01:21:05.740]   No trolldom.
[01:21:05.740 --> 01:21:09.500]   So he's now registering domain names, new domains.
[01:21:09.500 --> 01:21:10.380]   Not buying old domains.
[01:21:10.380 --> 01:21:14.380]   He's trying to find new domains.
[01:21:14.380 --> 01:21:16.380]   So I'm sure he snagged up Chumbi TV.
[01:21:16.380 --> 01:21:19.100]   His business, you may have heard of it, by domains.
[01:21:19.100 --> 01:21:26.380]   He's actually sold that for $80 million in 2005.
[01:21:26.380 --> 01:21:29.180]   And he has a patent for a system he developed
[01:21:29.180 --> 01:21:33.300]   to generate domain name recognitions and recommendations
[01:21:33.300 --> 01:21:35.380]   and then register the domain name.
[01:21:35.380 --> 01:21:36.100]   Well, I mean, this is--
[01:21:36.100 --> 01:21:38.620]   So you say to the software, Chumbi.
[01:21:38.620 --> 01:21:41.700]   And he goes, and it's got 20 names like that.
[01:21:41.700 --> 01:21:44.540]   Well, that's why I've always been nervous about whenever
[01:21:44.540 --> 01:21:46.660]   I search for a domain for a project.
[01:21:46.660 --> 01:21:51.300]   I won't search for it via whatever the registrar stuff is.
[01:21:51.300 --> 01:21:53.860]   Because that's kind of a trigger to say--
[01:21:53.860 --> 01:21:54.380]   Yeah.
[01:21:54.380 --> 01:21:56.420]   Because they'll know that you're looking for that.
[01:21:56.420 --> 01:21:59.900]   So you type in the URL and you just pray it doesn't load.
[01:21:59.900 --> 01:22:01.020]   This has always been--
[01:22:01.020 --> 01:22:03.620]   and it's always been the internet rumor
[01:22:03.620 --> 01:22:06.140]   that if you go to, let's say, GoDaddy.
[01:22:06.140 --> 01:22:07.100]   Let's say theoretically.
[01:22:07.100 --> 01:22:07.900]   Theoretically.
[01:22:07.900 --> 01:22:08.620]   Sure.
[01:22:08.620 --> 01:22:10.860]   And you enter in a domain name and it's available,
[01:22:10.860 --> 01:22:11.700]   but you don't buy it.
[01:22:11.700 --> 01:22:14.140]   You come back five minutes later and somebody's got it.
[01:22:14.140 --> 01:22:15.100]   Yep.
[01:22:15.100 --> 01:22:18.420]   It's interesting how that always happens.
[01:22:18.420 --> 01:22:20.220]   It's very weird.
[01:22:20.220 --> 01:22:21.660]   Anyway, you can cost the bottom line.
[01:22:21.660 --> 01:22:22.660]   The URL, the Facebook.
[01:22:22.660 --> 01:22:25.140]   Stupid names.
[01:22:25.140 --> 01:22:29.020]   The guy now averages 300 names a day at his company.
[01:22:29.020 --> 01:22:30.660]   It's called domainmarket.com.
[01:22:30.660 --> 01:22:33.020]   He makes almost half a million dollars a month doing this.
[01:22:33.020 --> 01:22:34.060]   Yipes.
[01:22:34.060 --> 01:22:36.500]   Wow.
[01:22:36.500 --> 01:22:37.420]   It's just wild.
[01:22:37.420 --> 01:22:40.300]   I don't know how he bought 15,000 domain names in one day,
[01:22:40.300 --> 01:22:40.980]   though.
[01:22:40.980 --> 01:22:42.260]   It must be automated, right?
[01:22:42.260 --> 01:22:42.980]   Script.
[01:22:42.980 --> 01:22:44.940]   Well, this is the kind of stuff that we should--
[01:22:44.940 --> 01:22:48.980]   I mean, if there are going to be laws for squatting,
[01:22:48.980 --> 01:22:50.940]   I mean, isn't this the kind of behavior
[01:22:50.940 --> 01:22:52.860]   we want to protect against?
[01:22:52.860 --> 01:22:56.580]   The good news is if you have a trademark and he has your domain,
[01:22:56.580 --> 01:22:58.580]   you can go to ICANN and say, no, no, no, no.
[01:22:58.580 --> 01:22:59.820]   I have the trademark, Twig.
[01:22:59.820 --> 01:23:00.660]   Give me that domain.
[01:23:00.660 --> 01:23:01.180]   Yeah.
[01:23:01.180 --> 01:23:02.540]   And he has to surrender it.
[01:23:02.540 --> 01:23:03.220]   So really--
[01:23:03.220 --> 01:23:04.260]   But that's a process.
[01:23:04.260 --> 01:23:07.340]   And it's a process that he might be very willing to serve.
[01:23:07.340 --> 01:23:09.900]   And if you don't have a trademark, like your name,
[01:23:09.900 --> 01:23:11.820]   Justin Robert Young, is not a trademark.
[01:23:11.820 --> 01:23:12.540]   No.
[01:23:12.540 --> 01:23:13.540]   Do you have just--
[01:23:13.540 --> 01:23:14.040]   I do.
[01:23:14.040 --> 01:23:15.260]   I have just Robert Young.com.
[01:23:15.260 --> 01:23:16.420]   I don't have Leo Laporte.com.
[01:23:16.420 --> 01:23:17.460]   Somebody else has that.
[01:23:17.460 --> 01:23:17.940]   Who does?
[01:23:17.940 --> 01:23:18.300]   I don't know.
[01:23:18.300 --> 01:23:18.660]   Some guy--
[01:23:18.660 --> 01:23:19.100]   What do you want to do?
[01:23:19.100 --> 01:23:19.700]   Find the guy?
[01:23:19.700 --> 01:23:20.140]   Get him?
[01:23:20.140 --> 01:23:20.500]   Yeah.
[01:23:20.500 --> 01:23:22.660]   Preach his legs.
[01:23:22.660 --> 01:23:24.980]   Knee cap him.
[01:23:24.980 --> 01:23:26.540]   No, don't.
[01:23:26.540 --> 01:23:30.140]   William Shatner.
[01:23:30.140 --> 01:23:32.100]   That's all.
[01:23:32.100 --> 01:23:33.220]   That's all you need.
[01:23:33.220 --> 01:23:33.740]   That's all.
[01:23:33.740 --> 01:23:35.020]   Or just get it randomly.
[01:23:35.020 --> 01:23:36.500]   This is like a radio contest.
[01:23:36.500 --> 01:23:38.340]   Or you're going to say actor's names.
[01:23:38.340 --> 01:23:40.460]   And if you collect all of them over the month of April,
[01:23:40.460 --> 01:23:41.660]   then you can send it to--
[01:23:41.660 --> 01:23:43.140]   collect all the names.
[01:23:43.140 --> 01:23:44.180]   Send it to P.O. Box.
[01:23:44.180 --> 01:23:46.460]   He has 1 million followers.
[01:23:46.460 --> 01:23:49.780]   He got his 1 millionth, and he took him to dinner.
[01:23:49.780 --> 01:23:50.300]   Oh.
[01:23:50.300 --> 01:23:51.300]   Aw.
[01:23:51.300 --> 01:23:54.820]   It's-- there they are at dinner.
[01:23:54.820 --> 01:23:55.820]   Twitter.
[01:23:55.820 --> 01:23:56.780]   We're having--
[01:23:56.780 --> 01:23:58.540]   Texavie, William Shatner.
[01:23:58.540 --> 01:23:59.040]   Huh?
[01:23:59.040 --> 01:23:59.540]   He's like--
[01:23:59.540 --> 01:24:03.260]   He can't even shoot in landscape.
[01:24:03.260 --> 01:24:04.940]   Can we make it so?
[01:24:04.940 --> 01:24:06.460]   He's in his pitch black.
[01:24:06.460 --> 01:24:07.220]   Yeah.
[01:24:07.220 --> 01:24:07.740]   Oh, look.
[01:24:07.740 --> 01:24:08.260]   Oh, look.
[01:24:08.260 --> 01:24:09.260]   It turned someplace.
[01:24:09.260 --> 01:24:11.340]   That way.
[01:24:11.340 --> 01:24:13.820]   Even on his iPhone, Shatner hates doing two takes.
[01:24:13.820 --> 01:24:15.660]   Yeah.
[01:24:15.660 --> 01:24:21.340]   P-D-O-X, P-Dox, Junior, and his wife, Mrs. P-Dox.
[01:24:21.340 --> 01:24:23.540]   They were in Charlotte, North Carolina.
[01:24:23.540 --> 01:24:24.900]   I'll say, it is-- it is--
[01:24:24.900 --> 01:24:26.460]   How about that, huh?
[01:24:26.460 --> 01:24:31.140]   It is fascinating how much he is savvy with understanding
[01:24:31.140 --> 01:24:32.780]   the rabid Star Trek--
[01:24:32.780 --> 01:24:34.820]   That's pretty savvy, isn't it?
[01:24:34.820 --> 01:24:37.300]   That's pretty savvy to do that.
[01:24:37.300 --> 01:24:39.100]   He's got 1,022,000 followers.
[01:24:39.100 --> 01:24:40.220]   I mean, I think he gets it.
[01:24:40.220 --> 01:24:43.420]   There is something to be learned from Shatner
[01:24:43.420 --> 01:24:44.980]   for a lot of people that--
[01:24:44.980 --> 01:24:47.580]   actors that have conflicted ideas on the fact
[01:24:47.580 --> 01:24:50.900]   that there's a certain genre or a television show
[01:24:50.900 --> 01:24:51.660]   that they're famous for.
[01:24:51.660 --> 01:24:53.340]   He's not doing this himself, though.
[01:24:53.340 --> 01:24:54.420]   He's probably got somebody--
[01:24:54.420 --> 01:24:55.260]   Oh, he does.
[01:24:55.260 --> 01:24:56.700]   Someone do it again.
[01:24:56.700 --> 01:25:00.020]   Yeah, he has said that he's never actually touched Twitter,
[01:25:00.020 --> 01:25:02.260]   but he has someone who has formed.
[01:25:02.260 --> 01:25:04.340]   But it's somebody who trusts.
[01:25:04.340 --> 01:25:06.980]   Remember, he appeared on "Saturday Night Live"
[01:25:06.980 --> 01:25:09.620]   making fun of his own fan base--
[01:25:09.620 --> 01:25:10.460]   Right.
[01:25:10.460 --> 01:25:11.820]   --in that famous skit where he said--
[01:25:11.820 --> 01:25:12.980]   Get a live!
[01:25:12.980 --> 01:25:14.740]   Right.
[01:25:14.740 --> 01:25:17.340]   And this is his most recent tweet.
[01:25:17.340 --> 01:25:19.140]   "The crew of the International Space Station
[01:25:19.140 --> 01:25:21.260]   listens to my seeking major time album."
[01:25:21.260 --> 01:25:25.860]   Have you heard William Shatner's "Major Tom"?
[01:25:25.860 --> 01:25:27.260]   Sure.
[01:25:27.260 --> 01:25:33.420]   This is the International Space Station, a special message.
[01:25:33.420 --> 01:25:37.980]   Hey, guys, six months in space is a long time.
[01:25:37.980 --> 01:25:41.300]   And if you listen to my record, a time
[01:25:41.300 --> 01:25:44.460]   will pass by quickly-- not quickly enough,
[01:25:44.460 --> 01:25:46.380]   but you've got so much to do up there.
[01:25:46.380 --> 01:25:49.980]   I wish you really good luck, good health,
[01:25:49.980 --> 01:25:52.740]   get some good work done, and we'll look forward to your time.
[01:25:52.740 --> 01:25:53.620]   It's not great.
[01:25:53.620 --> 01:25:57.220]   And I hope you enjoy seeking major time.
[01:25:57.220 --> 01:26:00.300]   But I'm floating in a most peculiar way.
[01:26:00.300 --> 01:26:03.140]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:26:03.140 --> 01:26:06.780]   And the stars look--
[01:26:06.780 --> 01:26:08.460]   Apparently, yeah, no, this is--
[01:26:08.460 --> 01:26:12.300]   as the chat room is pointing out, he's a silon.
[01:26:12.300 --> 01:26:13.180]   I don't know what the--
[01:26:13.180 --> 01:26:14.620]   I don't know why this sound is so bad.
[01:26:14.620 --> 01:26:15.060]   The sound is weird.
[01:26:15.060 --> 01:26:16.820]   That's, you know, William Shatner right there.
[01:26:16.820 --> 01:26:18.940]   In a nutshell, thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:26:18.940 --> 01:26:20.460]   I'm not following him.
[01:26:20.460 --> 01:26:22.780]   I missed out on that dinner if I had just pressed the button
[01:26:22.780 --> 01:26:23.580]   at the right time.
[01:26:23.580 --> 01:26:24.980]   Look at that.
[01:26:24.980 --> 01:26:27.780]   And it now says, I might want to follow Paul Camuso and Julie
[01:26:27.780 --> 01:26:28.140]   Benz.
[01:26:28.140 --> 01:26:29.740]   I don't even know why--
[01:26:29.740 --> 01:26:31.420]   They weren't captains.
[01:26:31.420 --> 01:26:33.380]   Do you follow Nimoy, who's also on there?
[01:26:33.380 --> 01:26:34.380]   No.
[01:26:34.380 --> 01:26:34.880]   What's his--
[01:26:34.880 --> 01:26:36.060]   There are there are there boys on there.
[01:26:36.060 --> 01:26:36.340]   What's his handle?
[01:26:36.340 --> 01:26:39.100]   I think he's the real Nimoy, if I'm not mistaken.
[01:26:39.100 --> 01:26:40.580]   I forget.
[01:26:40.580 --> 01:26:41.300]   That looks like him.
[01:26:41.300 --> 01:26:42.020]   Oh, there he is.
[01:26:42.020 --> 01:26:42.660]   There he is.
[01:26:42.660 --> 01:26:43.300]   There he is.
[01:26:43.300 --> 01:26:44.220]   The real Nimoy.
[01:26:44.220 --> 01:26:45.300]   Checkmark.
[01:26:45.300 --> 01:26:45.900]   Here we go.
[01:26:45.900 --> 01:26:46.460]   Following him.
[01:26:46.460 --> 01:26:48.140]   I'm already following him.
[01:26:48.140 --> 01:26:49.340]   And I didn't even know it.
[01:26:49.340 --> 01:26:51.420]   See, now next week, Leo will follow the cast
[01:26:51.420 --> 01:26:54.220]   of Next Generation.
[01:26:54.220 --> 01:26:55.180]   This could be an ongoing--
[01:26:55.180 --> 01:26:56.060]   Followed by Voyager.
[01:26:56.060 --> 01:26:57.620]   Ongoing a process here.
[01:27:00.180 --> 01:27:03.500]   Yeah, he signs off all his tweets with LLAP.
[01:27:03.500 --> 01:27:04.380]   What's that?
[01:27:04.380 --> 01:27:05.980]   Live long and prosper.
[01:27:05.980 --> 01:27:06.500]   Boom.
[01:27:06.500 --> 01:27:07.220]   I thought about it.
[01:27:07.220 --> 01:27:08.100]   I thought of it.
[01:27:08.100 --> 01:27:17.820]   I'll tell you, did you guys hear the soft subscription
[01:27:17.820 --> 01:27:19.180]   numbers for Netflix?
[01:27:19.180 --> 01:27:19.860]   No.
[01:27:19.860 --> 01:27:20.220]   Yeah.
[01:27:20.220 --> 01:27:22.980]   Coming in tomorrow, I think, is their earnings call.
[01:27:22.980 --> 01:27:26.180]   But all the rumors are leaked out.
[01:27:26.180 --> 01:27:27.300]   I'm rooting for these guys.
[01:27:27.300 --> 01:27:28.180]   Aren't you rooting for Netflix?
[01:27:28.180 --> 01:27:29.020]   Oh, listen.
[01:27:29.020 --> 01:27:33.460]   Netflix is, to me, every bit, the cultural touchstone
[01:27:33.460 --> 01:27:37.420]   that HBO was in the '80s and '90s and everything.
[01:27:37.420 --> 01:27:38.340]   I just love them.
[01:27:38.340 --> 01:27:39.660]   I think it's great.
[01:27:39.660 --> 01:27:41.100]   And I've been watching Lil' Hammer.
[01:27:41.100 --> 01:27:43.060]   They're prepared to go to Norway.
[01:27:43.060 --> 01:27:44.820]   Well, there we go.
[01:27:44.820 --> 01:27:45.260]   Right.
[01:27:45.260 --> 01:27:46.700]   That's their original production.
[01:27:46.700 --> 01:27:51.660]   They're doing now King of Hearts with George Spacey.
[01:27:51.660 --> 01:27:52.460]   Kevin Spacey.
[01:27:52.460 --> 01:27:53.260]   I'm excited.
[01:27:53.260 --> 01:27:54.140]   I think that this--
[01:27:54.140 --> 01:27:56.540]   Well, and Arrested Development is the big splashy--
[01:27:56.540 --> 01:27:58.620]   They saved Arrested Development.
[01:27:58.620 --> 01:27:59.220]   The thing.
[01:27:59.220 --> 01:28:00.180]   But I'll tell you what.
[01:28:00.180 --> 01:28:01.780]   I think that they're really making a mistake,
[01:28:01.780 --> 01:28:03.900]   because they announced this week--
[01:28:03.900 --> 01:28:05.420]   actually, I think it was--
[01:28:05.420 --> 01:28:07.860]   one of the corporate leadership there
[01:28:07.860 --> 01:28:10.580]   announced that NAB or told somebody at NAB
[01:28:10.580 --> 01:28:13.060]   that they're going to-- their philosophy
[01:28:13.060 --> 01:28:15.260]   is going to be released the entire season,
[01:28:15.260 --> 01:28:16.780]   as they did with Lil' Hammer at once.
[01:28:16.780 --> 01:28:17.700]   All at once.
[01:28:17.700 --> 01:28:18.460]   Like Netflix.
[01:28:18.460 --> 01:28:19.260]   So you can watch it all.
[01:28:19.260 --> 01:28:19.540]   And episodes.
[01:28:19.540 --> 01:28:21.620]   You have to, because that's the culture of Netflix,
[01:28:21.620 --> 01:28:26.460]   is you consume shows.
[01:28:26.460 --> 01:28:28.260]   I think it's a horrible mistake.
[01:28:28.260 --> 01:28:28.760]   Really?
[01:28:28.760 --> 01:28:29.420]   Oh, yeah.
[01:28:29.420 --> 01:28:31.140]   You think they should parse it out?
[01:28:31.140 --> 01:28:33.980]   Because like HBO, HBO doesn't necessarily
[01:28:33.980 --> 01:28:37.500]   care as much about user or abuse numbers.
[01:28:37.500 --> 01:28:38.500]   They really don't.
[01:28:38.500 --> 01:28:40.340]   They care about awards.
[01:28:40.340 --> 01:28:41.700]   They care about press.
[01:28:41.700 --> 01:28:43.180]   Because every time that they get an award,
[01:28:43.180 --> 01:28:46.060]   every time that they get press, it's a free advertisement
[01:28:46.060 --> 01:28:48.100]   that HBO is something you should buy.
[01:28:48.100 --> 01:28:49.980]   And you're constantly reminding people
[01:28:49.980 --> 01:28:52.580]   that this is something that you should be paying money for.
[01:28:52.580 --> 01:28:55.020]   Arrested Development is a variable of a show
[01:28:55.020 --> 01:28:57.260]   that critics will give the benefit of the doubt
[01:28:57.260 --> 01:28:58.300]   they want to talk about.
[01:28:58.300 --> 01:29:00.380]   And we'll create a significant internet buzz.
[01:29:00.380 --> 01:29:02.780]   When they drop all 10 episodes, that buzz
[01:29:02.780 --> 01:29:04.420]   will last for three weeks.
[01:29:04.420 --> 01:29:07.540]   If they released these 10 episodes over the course of 10
[01:29:07.540 --> 01:29:09.940]   weeks, you would consistently be talking about what
[01:29:09.940 --> 01:29:12.500]   the last episode was, what the next episode is going to be.
[01:29:12.500 --> 01:29:14.500]   And you can spread that out and continue
[01:29:14.500 --> 01:29:17.820]   to get an advertising drive for people
[01:29:17.820 --> 01:29:20.060]   to be aware of Netflix and think, well, maybe I
[01:29:20.060 --> 01:29:22.020]   should subscribe to Netflix now.
[01:29:22.020 --> 01:29:24.540]   I mean, it's the same reason why people advertise
[01:29:24.540 --> 01:29:25.580]   on the Twitch network.
[01:29:25.580 --> 01:29:27.380]   Why Netflix ever ties on the Twitter network?
[01:29:27.380 --> 01:29:30.620]   Because they consistently on all the shows in the platform
[01:29:30.620 --> 01:29:32.180]   remind you, this is a thing.
[01:29:32.180 --> 01:29:32.860]   This is a thing.
[01:29:32.860 --> 01:29:33.420]   This is a thing.
[01:29:33.420 --> 01:29:34.620]   You'll like this thing.
[01:29:34.620 --> 01:29:36.780]   And I think they're really dropping the ball
[01:29:36.780 --> 01:29:38.620]   and putting it all out at once.
[01:29:38.620 --> 01:29:39.860]   I'm not sure I agree.
[01:29:39.860 --> 01:29:41.540]   I think it's a new culture.
[01:29:41.540 --> 01:29:42.900]   That's the old culture.
[01:29:42.900 --> 01:29:46.860]   And the Netflix culture, as you watch 24 hours,
[01:29:46.860 --> 01:29:49.780]   and you watch every episode of season four
[01:29:49.780 --> 01:29:53.020]   of "Battle Star Galactica" and one gigantic gulp.
[01:29:53.020 --> 01:29:53.580]   Yes.
[01:29:53.580 --> 01:29:55.980]   But they're also dropping subscribers.
[01:29:55.980 --> 01:29:56.340]   Are they?
[01:29:56.340 --> 01:29:58.620]   And then you tell your friends, and they tell your friends,
[01:29:58.620 --> 01:30:01.180]   and watching all that takes a lot of time.
[01:30:01.180 --> 01:30:06.060]   And that's how Netflix has built its audiences really
[01:30:06.060 --> 01:30:07.060]   almost by word of mouth.
[01:30:07.060 --> 01:30:09.940]   And those annoying pop-up ads, of course.
[01:30:09.940 --> 01:30:11.700]   But pop-unders.
[01:30:11.700 --> 01:30:14.780]   But this is how Netflix has won so far.
[01:30:14.780 --> 01:30:17.940]   And I think that they are smart to continue dropping it
[01:30:17.940 --> 01:30:18.420]   in this way.
[01:30:18.420 --> 01:30:20.660]   The fact they drop it all at once,
[01:30:20.660 --> 01:30:22.140]   they will generally get a lot of buzz.
[01:30:22.140 --> 01:30:23.740]   And I think it'll actually happen over time,
[01:30:23.740 --> 01:30:26.020]   as more and more people take the time to watch it.
[01:30:26.020 --> 01:30:27.300]   Well, you have to be careful, too.
[01:30:27.300 --> 01:30:29.420]   You don't want to do it in a way that annoys you.
[01:30:29.420 --> 01:30:30.500]   So what are the soft numbers?
[01:30:30.500 --> 01:30:32.060]   Are they bad?
[01:30:32.060 --> 01:30:33.780]   Well, here, let me pull up the actual--
[01:30:33.780 --> 01:30:34.220]   the actual numbers.
[01:30:34.220 --> 01:30:34.980]   I hope they're not bad.
[01:30:34.980 --> 01:30:37.740]   And they haven't announced that tomorrow's the earnings call.
[01:30:37.740 --> 01:30:38.380]   Right.
[01:30:38.380 --> 01:30:38.940]   And so it's--
[01:30:38.940 --> 01:30:43.580]   Could you do the earnings call as Netflix hype man for us?
[01:30:43.580 --> 01:30:45.740]   Well, I mean, I'd quit hype man.
[01:30:45.740 --> 01:30:46.580]   I'd quit hype man.
[01:30:46.580 --> 01:30:47.460]   I don't know.
[01:30:47.460 --> 01:30:52.100]   We could be saving you time, money, and hassle with Netflix.
[01:30:52.100 --> 01:30:55.700]   But yeah, I don't actually have an Netflix ad in this show.
[01:30:55.700 --> 01:30:56.660]   I really should.
[01:30:56.660 --> 01:30:58.660]   That's the one read that I always struggle with.
[01:30:58.660 --> 01:31:00.500]   You, on a SFW show.
[01:31:00.500 --> 01:31:01.500]   Why?
[01:31:01.500 --> 01:31:01.700]   Just because--
[01:31:01.700 --> 01:31:03.420]   Let's just say that Netflix, don't you?
[01:31:03.420 --> 01:31:03.860]   I love it.
[01:31:03.860 --> 01:31:04.260]   No, no, no.
[01:31:04.260 --> 01:31:06.420]   It's not that I struggle with it because I don't enjoy it.
[01:31:06.420 --> 01:31:09.460]   I am a customer, a happy, very happy customer of Netflix.
[01:31:09.460 --> 01:31:09.740]   I got it.
[01:31:09.740 --> 01:31:14.180]   You know, my problem is I got five DVDs in the hutch.
[01:31:14.180 --> 01:31:15.420]   They've got this much dust on them.
[01:31:15.420 --> 01:31:17.500]   I've got to cancel that DVD subscription.
[01:31:17.500 --> 01:31:18.260]   I never use them.
[01:31:18.260 --> 01:31:20.620]   I've been digital only for a very long time.
[01:31:20.620 --> 01:31:22.620]   But then I got to get rid of the hutch because nobody's--
[01:31:22.620 --> 01:31:23.620]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:31:23.620 --> 01:31:25.140]   Oh, huches.
[01:31:25.140 --> 01:31:26.140]   They're so old fashion.
[01:31:26.140 --> 01:31:27.580]   What did you call that thing?
[01:31:27.580 --> 01:31:28.300]   The TV's on it.
[01:31:28.300 --> 01:31:28.940]   It's not a hutch.
[01:31:28.940 --> 01:31:30.020]   It's just a credenza.
[01:31:30.020 --> 01:31:31.140]   A home entertainment center.
[01:31:31.140 --> 01:31:32.140]   Home entertainment center.
[01:31:32.140 --> 01:31:34.500]   No, I don't want to have one of those.
[01:31:34.500 --> 01:31:36.180]   It might be that, but I don't want to call it that.
[01:31:36.180 --> 01:31:37.820]   A credenza?
[01:31:37.820 --> 01:31:38.940]   We have one of those two.
[01:31:38.940 --> 01:31:42.100]   It's a credenza, unfortunately.
[01:31:42.100 --> 01:31:43.380]   What is it called?
[01:31:43.380 --> 01:31:44.780]   I guess it's a home entertainment--
[01:31:44.780 --> 01:31:46.260]   A credenza, I think, is--
[01:31:46.260 --> 01:31:47.100]   That's a little--
[01:31:47.100 --> 01:31:47.700]   That's a little--
[01:31:47.700 --> 01:31:48.740]   That's a little fruity.
[01:31:48.740 --> 01:31:50.340]   A little hoity toity.
[01:31:50.340 --> 01:31:53.620]   We have a 1980s era--
[01:31:53.620 --> 01:31:54.900]   Remember, Blonde Oak?
[01:31:54.900 --> 01:31:55.260]   Yeah.
[01:31:55.260 --> 01:31:58.020]   Blonde Oak, home entertainment center with two columns
[01:31:58.020 --> 01:31:58.700]   on either side.
[01:31:58.700 --> 01:32:00.740]   You're going to love this new IKEA TV.
[01:32:00.740 --> 01:32:02.020]   It'll go very well with that.
[01:32:02.020 --> 01:32:03.420]   Oh, I need that.
[01:32:03.420 --> 01:32:04.060]   I saw that.
[01:32:04.060 --> 01:32:04.860]   I want that.
[01:32:04.860 --> 01:32:07.460]   IKEA is going to sell TVs according to the Wall Street
[01:32:07.460 --> 01:32:11.220]   Journal, with the furniture built into the furniture.
[01:32:11.220 --> 01:32:14.060]   So you'll have to use an Allen wrench and a little thing
[01:32:14.060 --> 01:32:15.740]   to put your TV together.
[01:32:15.740 --> 01:32:17.620]   I don't hope not.
[01:32:17.620 --> 01:32:19.340]   OK, real quick with the Netflix thing.
[01:32:19.340 --> 01:32:22.740]   The numbers that are expected to be announced this week
[01:32:22.740 --> 01:32:25.100]   will show that although they did have an increased number
[01:32:25.100 --> 01:32:28.700]   of members, it was soft enough that they will be posting
[01:32:28.700 --> 01:32:31.300]   negative profit for the company in large part
[01:32:31.300 --> 01:32:33.860]   because of the renegotiated contracts,
[01:32:33.860 --> 01:32:35.020]   because now they're on contracts to--
[01:32:35.020 --> 01:32:36.220]   See, that's their problem.
[01:32:36.220 --> 01:32:38.460]   That's their problem is that they're doing well,
[01:32:38.460 --> 01:32:40.020]   but they're business-- it's like Kodak.
[01:32:40.020 --> 01:32:44.020]   Their business model is based on the more profitable deals
[01:32:44.020 --> 01:32:47.820]   that they had with the movie companies a few years ago.
[01:32:47.820 --> 01:32:50.380]   And maybe they can't be profitable at $7.99 a month.
[01:32:50.380 --> 01:32:50.820]   I don't know.
[01:32:50.820 --> 01:32:53.900]   Well, no, but this is the reason why new subscribers
[01:32:53.900 --> 01:32:56.460]   are the only thing that matters in the same way for HBO.
[01:32:56.460 --> 01:32:58.860]   And no matter what you do, you always,
[01:32:58.860 --> 01:33:00.940]   if your Netflix should be thinking about how many--
[01:33:00.940 --> 01:33:02.860]   And you think they get more new subscribers
[01:33:02.860 --> 01:33:06.220]   by dribbling it out for arrested developments specifically.
[01:33:06.220 --> 01:33:07.140]   I'm not saying for everything.
[01:33:07.140 --> 01:33:08.620]   I'm saying for a show that has a tremendous splash--
[01:33:08.620 --> 01:33:09.260]   Because they come back--
[01:33:09.260 --> 01:33:11.620]   Because then people come back every week
[01:33:11.620 --> 01:33:13.220]   and they see the other stuff.
[01:33:13.220 --> 01:33:15.260]   It's just that you're going to have critics talking
[01:33:15.260 --> 01:33:16.540]   about it every episode.
[01:33:16.540 --> 01:33:18.620]   If you released it episode by episode, then all of a sudden,
[01:33:18.620 --> 01:33:20.940]   you get the blogs writing about it.
[01:33:20.940 --> 01:33:22.460]   You get television sites writing about it.
[01:33:22.460 --> 01:33:23.900]   You get more continuous coverage.
[01:33:23.900 --> 01:33:26.140]   Yeah, because that will spread it over two weeks.
[01:33:26.140 --> 01:33:27.420]   And then it's going to be there forever.
[01:33:27.420 --> 01:33:29.500]   You've got a point.
[01:33:29.500 --> 01:33:31.740]   So the IKEA TV--
[01:33:31.740 --> 01:33:32.180]   Yes.
[01:33:32.180 --> 01:33:32.620]   Look at this.
[01:33:32.620 --> 01:33:34.340]   They put a TV in a hutch.
[01:33:34.340 --> 01:33:34.940]   Finally.
[01:33:34.940 --> 01:33:36.460]   Yeah.
[01:33:36.460 --> 01:33:38.740]   I'm sick of these TV less hutches.
[01:33:38.740 --> 01:33:39.500]   I'm looking at my hutch.
[01:33:39.500 --> 01:33:41.340]   I'm never buying another hutch without a TV.
[01:33:41.340 --> 01:33:42.380]   What are you doing, hutch?
[01:33:42.380 --> 01:33:45.580]   It's got an LED TV, a sound system with wireless base
[01:33:45.580 --> 01:33:47.500]   speakers that you could put somewhere else.
[01:33:47.500 --> 01:33:51.620]   Internet connection, DVD, DVD, Blu-ray player, all together.
[01:33:51.620 --> 01:33:53.020]   All the controls in one remote.
[01:33:53.020 --> 01:33:55.140]   This is-- unfortunately, you have to buy a TV made
[01:33:55.140 --> 01:33:57.260]   by a company called Tickle.
[01:33:57.260 --> 01:33:59.060]   T-hee!
[01:33:59.060 --> 01:34:00.740]   It's a T-hee, not a TV.
[01:34:00.740 --> 01:34:02.220]   Woo-hoo!
[01:34:02.220 --> 01:34:03.020]   Look at me!
[01:34:03.020 --> 01:34:03.860]   It's a Tickle TV.
[01:34:03.860 --> 01:34:04.820]   Tickle TV.
[01:34:04.820 --> 01:34:09.060]   TCL makes-- it's a Chinese manufacturer.
[01:34:09.060 --> 01:34:12.340]   And they come in four sizes, just like condoms, from 24.
[01:34:12.340 --> 01:34:15.300]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:34:15.300 --> 01:34:17.620]   Is that not true?
[01:34:17.620 --> 01:34:18.900]   24 inches to 46.
[01:34:18.900 --> 01:34:21.860]   They're not that big.
[01:34:21.860 --> 01:34:25.540]   It's called the-- now, I have to say this is in--
[01:34:25.540 --> 01:34:26.460]   in "suite-ish."
[01:34:26.460 --> 01:34:28.580]   Is it the-- opelevo, opelevo?
[01:34:28.580 --> 01:34:29.180]   Opelevo.
[01:34:29.180 --> 01:34:31.100]   Opelevo.
[01:34:31.100 --> 01:34:32.580]   Opelevo.
[01:34:32.580 --> 01:34:33.940]   It's-- it's in-- yeah.
[01:34:33.940 --> 01:34:35.860]   Yes, it comes in a flat pack.
[01:34:35.860 --> 01:34:38.460]   And you've got to assemble it at home.
[01:34:38.460 --> 01:34:40.980]   I can't believe they do that.
[01:34:40.980 --> 01:34:42.620]   They're going to sell it first in Sweden, France,
[01:34:42.620 --> 01:34:45.420]   Poland, Germany, and Italy in June.
[01:34:45.420 --> 01:34:50.500]   But worldwide for a mere 6,500 croner by the first half
[01:34:50.500 --> 01:34:51.660]   of next year.
[01:34:51.660 --> 01:34:54.780]   So is this the 19-- is this the 20--
[01:34:54.780 --> 01:35:01.020]   20-- the 21st century version of the TV set in the--
[01:35:01.020 --> 01:35:03.540]   in the credenza from the 1960s?
[01:35:03.540 --> 01:35:04.940]   It's exactly what it is.
[01:35:04.940 --> 01:35:05.460]   It is.
[01:35:05.460 --> 01:35:06.940]   You're right.
[01:35:06.940 --> 01:35:07.860]   That's what it is.
[01:35:07.860 --> 01:35:08.580]   It's so funny.
[01:35:08.580 --> 01:35:09.380]   There was-- there was--
[01:35:09.380 --> 01:35:10.020]   Works in a drawer.
[01:35:10.020 --> 01:35:11.140]   It's a quasar.
[01:35:11.140 --> 01:35:14.060]   There was that great moment in--
[01:35:14.060 --> 01:35:17.060]   for those of you who watch Mad Men where Campbell--
[01:35:17.060 --> 01:35:17.540]   Oh, yes.
[01:35:17.540 --> 01:35:18.060]   Oh, yeah.
[01:35:18.060 --> 01:35:22.060]   You know, is showing off his big hutch stereo system.
[01:35:22.060 --> 01:35:23.300]   That's like seven feet wide.
[01:35:23.300 --> 01:35:24.100]   That's in last week.
[01:35:24.100 --> 01:35:24.740]   I haven't seen any yet.
[01:35:24.740 --> 01:35:25.660]   Last week's episode.
[01:35:25.660 --> 01:35:27.020]   And that's like-- that happened.
[01:35:27.020 --> 01:35:28.500]   And then like the next day, this news
[01:35:28.500 --> 01:35:31.940]   hit about the IKEA TV in a hutch thing.
[01:35:31.940 --> 01:35:33.020]   And it's like-- it's back.
[01:35:33.020 --> 01:35:34.020]   It's like what Dwight said.
[01:35:34.020 --> 01:35:37.500]   All of this has happened before, and it will happen again.
[01:35:37.500 --> 01:35:38.740]   You know who else is going to--
[01:35:38.740 --> 01:35:40.620]   Well, Chamberlain could lay down in it.
[01:35:40.620 --> 01:35:47.900]   You know who else is going to do their own TV shows as Hulu?
[01:35:47.900 --> 01:35:48.900]   Yeah.
[01:35:48.900 --> 01:35:50.140]   Original programming.
[01:35:50.140 --> 01:35:50.780]   That's the new.
[01:35:50.780 --> 01:35:51.940]   That's the wave.
[01:35:51.940 --> 01:35:54.340]   Play of the future.
[01:35:54.340 --> 01:35:56.060]   And it's only going to be a couple of years
[01:35:56.060 --> 01:35:59.300]   before when we saw movie stars--
[01:35:59.300 --> 01:36:03.340]   the lines between a movie star doing a television show
[01:36:03.340 --> 01:36:06.300]   kind of was sort of broken down about five or six years ago.
[01:36:06.300 --> 01:36:08.580]   And you started to see guys like Gary Sinise,
[01:36:08.580 --> 01:36:09.500]   or people that were other--
[01:36:09.500 --> 01:36:10.300]   Doing TV.
[01:36:10.300 --> 01:36:11.980]   --at Lawrence Fishburne doing television.
[01:36:11.980 --> 01:36:12.460]   Right.
[01:36:12.460 --> 01:36:14.020]   You're going to start to see--
[01:36:14.020 --> 01:36:17.180]   especially because these stars have enough money
[01:36:17.180 --> 01:36:21.660]   to fund the budgets and be producers on web content shows.
[01:36:21.660 --> 01:36:23.020]   And you're going to see more and more
[01:36:23.020 --> 01:36:25.060]   that these are going to be viable places where
[01:36:25.060 --> 01:36:28.020]   real acting talent and writing talent and directing talent
[01:36:28.020 --> 01:36:30.500]   will come to get original visions out to people
[01:36:30.500 --> 01:36:31.180]   that want to see them.
[01:36:31.180 --> 01:36:32.020]   But there's a risk here.
[01:36:32.020 --> 01:36:33.460]   Because remember Hulu was originally
[01:36:33.460 --> 01:36:36.420]   started to take network programming from NBC, Fox,
[01:36:36.420 --> 01:36:38.460]   and others and put it on the internet.
[01:36:38.460 --> 01:36:40.780]   Because these guys couldn't figure it out.
[01:36:40.780 --> 01:36:41.900]   Well, they were investors in it.
[01:36:41.900 --> 01:36:43.060]   So this was their idea.
[01:36:43.060 --> 01:36:44.700]   And now they're kind of competing, aren't they,
[01:36:44.700 --> 01:36:46.940]   with these companies?
[01:36:46.940 --> 01:36:49.380]   Hulu, I didn't realize this, $8 a month,
[01:36:49.380 --> 01:36:50.820]   very similar to Netflix streaming.
[01:36:50.820 --> 01:36:51.660]   Yeah.
[01:36:51.660 --> 01:36:53.260]   But you have to have ads.
[01:36:53.260 --> 01:36:53.900]   You watch ads.
[01:36:53.900 --> 01:36:56.220]   And it's 2 million subscribers, though.
[01:36:56.220 --> 01:36:56.980]   That's a good number.
[01:36:56.980 --> 01:36:58.060]   What is Netflix?
[01:36:58.060 --> 01:36:58.820]   Does it say?
[01:36:58.820 --> 01:36:59.900]   Yeah, we can find that out.
[01:36:59.900 --> 01:37:01.500]   It's got to be more than 2 million.
[01:37:01.500 --> 01:37:03.060]   20, 40 of that sounds better.
[01:37:03.060 --> 01:37:04.380]   Yeah.
[01:37:04.380 --> 01:37:06.500]   Is your 2 million paid subscribers?
[01:37:06.500 --> 01:37:07.380]   That's paid?
[01:37:07.380 --> 01:37:08.380]   Hulu Plus--
[01:37:08.380 --> 01:37:09.420]   Because they also have free.
[01:37:09.420 --> 01:37:11.460]   No, that's 2 million Hulu Plus subscribers.
[01:37:11.460 --> 01:37:14.940]   According to this, they've got 38 million visits a month,
[01:37:14.940 --> 01:37:16.660]   unique some month.
[01:37:16.660 --> 01:37:20.740]   So they're in the ballpark of Netflix.
[01:37:20.740 --> 01:37:22.420]   Well, now 2 million versus 24 million.
[01:37:22.420 --> 01:37:27.500]   What's the future like for these services on--
[01:37:27.500 --> 01:37:30.060]   what do you see in your crystal ball?
[01:37:30.060 --> 01:37:31.780]   Not in my crystal ball.
[01:37:31.780 --> 01:37:35.780]   I see on my iPad a lot of television.
[01:37:35.780 --> 01:37:38.980]   And I don't really make any difference in what kind of
[01:37:38.980 --> 01:37:40.620]   television I watch.
[01:37:40.620 --> 01:37:42.340]   It could be Hulu.
[01:37:42.340 --> 01:37:43.540]   It could be Netflix.
[01:37:43.540 --> 01:37:44.660]   It could be HBO.
[01:37:44.660 --> 01:37:46.380]   It could be Vimeo.
[01:37:46.380 --> 01:37:47.340]   It could be--
[01:37:47.340 --> 01:37:48.820]   and I watch--
[01:37:48.820 --> 01:37:49.700]   Could be Twitter.
[01:37:49.700 --> 01:37:50.180]   --anything.
[01:37:50.180 --> 01:37:50.980]   It could be Twitter.
[01:37:50.980 --> 01:37:52.420]   You don't care.
[01:37:52.420 --> 01:37:53.140]   I don't care.
[01:37:53.140 --> 01:37:56.780]   For me, I watch video.
[01:37:56.780 --> 01:38:01.460]   I have no concept of differentiation
[01:38:01.460 --> 01:38:02.860]   between various services.
[01:38:02.860 --> 01:38:07.140]   I just look for things I want to watch and things which people
[01:38:07.140 --> 01:38:09.140]   tell me are interesting.
[01:38:09.140 --> 01:38:11.660]   Like if people were not talking about madmen,
[01:38:11.660 --> 01:38:13.060]   it won't be very interesting.
[01:38:13.060 --> 01:38:14.700]   It might be a great show.
[01:38:14.700 --> 01:38:18.020]   And it's the same way people talk about other things.
[01:38:18.020 --> 01:38:22.140]   So I think the whole notion of what is television is changing,
[01:38:22.140 --> 01:38:24.300]   what is video is changing.
[01:38:24.300 --> 01:38:26.820]   We should see how this evolves.
[01:38:26.820 --> 01:38:31.500]   My view is we're going to see one more service come out,
[01:38:31.500 --> 01:38:35.500]   which will be like Netflix and Hulu,
[01:38:35.500 --> 01:38:37.420]   but it will be slightly different.
[01:38:37.420 --> 01:38:40.180]   And that would be the third competitor in this space.
[01:38:40.180 --> 01:38:41.180]   And how will it be different?
[01:38:41.180 --> 01:38:42.740]   And who will do this?
[01:38:42.740 --> 01:38:44.500]   And I think it'll be a brand new company.
[01:38:44.500 --> 01:38:49.060]   It could be somebody like you who just has no preconceived
[01:38:49.060 --> 01:38:49.820]   notions of--
[01:38:49.820 --> 01:38:50.500]   That's what it needs to be.
[01:38:50.500 --> 01:38:51.780]   I mean, that's what held Hulu back
[01:38:51.780 --> 01:38:55.460]   was these connections with existing networks.
[01:38:55.460 --> 01:38:58.420]   And it's what hurt Netflix is they need content
[01:38:58.420 --> 01:38:59.900]   from the movie companies.
[01:38:59.900 --> 01:39:01.620]   Both of them are trying to divorce themselves
[01:39:01.620 --> 01:39:03.780]   from their past, in effect.
[01:39:03.780 --> 01:39:05.620]   But isn't the conventional wisdom
[01:39:05.620 --> 01:39:09.020]   that people don't want all these little bills?
[01:39:09.020 --> 01:39:10.580]   Or is that-- has that changed?
[01:39:10.580 --> 01:39:13.100]   It used to be people's like, oh, another $8 a month bill.
[01:39:13.100 --> 01:39:15.340]   I don't want another one.
[01:39:15.340 --> 01:39:18.300]   Well, I think it all depends on how good the billing systems
[01:39:18.300 --> 01:39:19.020]   become, right?
[01:39:19.020 --> 01:39:22.060]   So if you look at the Apple iTunes billing system
[01:39:22.060 --> 01:39:23.580]   or Amazon's billing system--
[01:39:23.580 --> 01:39:24.780]   It's transparent.
[01:39:24.780 --> 01:39:27.780]   It's pretty easy to kind of subscribe a la carte.
[01:39:27.780 --> 01:39:32.980]   You can go, I want MLB, I want NBA, and I want some HBO.
[01:39:32.980 --> 01:39:35.860]   And now even Netflix, you can buy Netflix through iTunes,
[01:39:35.860 --> 01:39:38.100]   which is a brilliant move from Netflix point of view.
[01:39:38.100 --> 01:39:38.460]   Right.
[01:39:38.460 --> 01:39:40.820]   So Netflix is just a cable channel.
[01:39:40.820 --> 01:39:43.500]   I don't care what kind of content they have.
[01:39:43.500 --> 01:39:48.100]   And they-- I used to think that they don't have the cutting
[01:39:48.100 --> 01:39:50.820]   edge content, and that's going to have an impact.
[01:39:50.820 --> 01:39:55.940]   But really, you watch TV for about 30, 40 minutes after dinner.
[01:39:55.940 --> 01:39:58.340]   And it doesn't matter what you're watching.
[01:39:58.340 --> 01:40:00.380]   Sometimes you're watching the new shows.
[01:40:00.380 --> 01:40:01.380]   Sometimes it's--
[01:40:01.380 --> 01:40:02.460]   Sometimes it's Jeopardy.
[01:40:02.460 --> 01:40:03.020]   It doesn't.
[01:40:03.020 --> 01:40:04.900]   Yeah, it doesn't matter.
[01:40:04.900 --> 01:40:06.260]   Like, you know, I get more--
[01:40:06.260 --> 01:40:07.780]   Well, I will not watch Wheel of Fortune.
[01:40:07.780 --> 01:40:09.780]   I'm sorry.
[01:40:09.780 --> 01:40:10.020]   I'm sorry.
[01:40:10.020 --> 01:40:11.740]   Everyone has standards.
[01:40:11.740 --> 01:40:12.300]   OK?
[01:40:12.300 --> 01:40:13.220]   All right.
[01:40:13.220 --> 01:40:15.100]   I'm going to push you.
[01:40:15.100 --> 01:40:16.220]   I like watching Vimeo.
[01:40:16.220 --> 01:40:17.300]   I like watching the--
[01:40:17.300 --> 01:40:18.140]   Well, all right.
[01:40:18.140 --> 01:40:20.940]   I've got a suggestion then for this third competitor
[01:40:20.940 --> 01:40:24.580]   to Hulu and Netflix, YouTube.
[01:40:24.580 --> 01:40:26.460]   I mean, they certainly hope that's it.
[01:40:26.460 --> 01:40:28.620]   Will Google-- do you think Google will try to start packaging
[01:40:28.620 --> 01:40:30.460]   this?
[01:40:30.460 --> 01:40:31.980]   They already are doing that.
[01:40:31.980 --> 01:40:33.660]   They've got these new channels, right?
[01:40:33.660 --> 01:40:38.020]   They spend $100 million on brand names, like Shaquille O'Neal
[01:40:38.020 --> 01:40:39.860]   and Felicia Day.
[01:40:39.860 --> 01:40:41.860]   There's two names you don't hear together a lot.
[01:40:41.860 --> 01:40:42.420]   Finally.
[01:40:42.420 --> 01:40:43.580]   Together at last.
[01:40:43.580 --> 01:40:44.100]   Finally.
[01:40:44.100 --> 01:40:45.860]   Shaq and Felicia Day.
[01:40:45.860 --> 01:40:50.020]   That just is, you know, match-made in heaven.
[01:40:50.020 --> 01:40:52.500]   No, but I think that that's interesting that YouTube--
[01:40:52.500 --> 01:40:54.580]   clearly, that's where YouTube wants to be.
[01:40:54.580 --> 01:40:58.100]   But Google is so tone-deaf, just like Microsoft sometimes,
[01:40:58.100 --> 01:41:03.660]   when it comes to making popular content.
[01:41:03.660 --> 01:41:06.540]   Although Google's already in place on a lot of smart TVs,
[01:41:06.540 --> 01:41:07.860]   if you look at Samsung--
[01:41:07.860 --> 01:41:09.060]   YouTube's everywhere.
[01:41:09.060 --> 01:41:12.140]   Or LG or any of the ones that have the smart TVs.
[01:41:12.140 --> 01:41:14.060]   There's a Google app Roku module.
[01:41:14.060 --> 01:41:15.620]   They're kind of already there.
[01:41:15.620 --> 01:41:17.860]   They're on Boxy, Apple TV.
[01:41:17.860 --> 01:41:20.900]   They're on-- they're everywhere.
[01:41:20.900 --> 01:41:22.500]   And so they kind of are in place.
[01:41:22.500 --> 01:41:23.660]   They just have to get people--
[01:41:23.660 --> 01:41:25.820]   they have to make it easier to get people to move over there
[01:41:25.820 --> 01:41:26.460]   and click on it.
[01:41:26.460 --> 01:41:27.900]   I'll tell you, I come home sometimes.
[01:41:27.900 --> 01:41:29.980]   And my teenage son, 17 years old,
[01:41:29.980 --> 01:41:32.220]   sitting around with his bros, there's like seven or eight
[01:41:32.220 --> 01:41:34.380]   of them.
[01:41:34.380 --> 01:41:35.020]   What?
[01:41:35.020 --> 01:41:35.580]   It's just funny.
[01:41:35.580 --> 01:41:37.140]   That's what they're called, bros.
[01:41:37.140 --> 01:41:39.780]   And dad, it's me and my bros hanging out.
[01:41:39.780 --> 01:41:40.700]   Exactly.
[01:41:40.700 --> 01:41:41.980]   What are you going to ask of me?
[01:41:41.980 --> 01:41:42.420]   OK.
[01:41:42.420 --> 01:41:44.180]   And they're sitting there watching YouTube.
[01:41:44.180 --> 01:41:44.780]   Yeah.
[01:41:44.780 --> 01:41:48.300]   But on the HDTV, they probably use the Apple TV
[01:41:48.300 --> 01:41:49.500]   or the probably maybe Roku.
[01:41:49.500 --> 01:41:50.540]   And that's what they're doing.
[01:41:50.540 --> 01:41:53.180]   They're sitting there watching YouTube, like it's television.
[01:41:53.180 --> 01:41:55.180]   And they're choosing videos.
[01:41:55.180 --> 01:41:55.980]   They're watching it.
[01:41:55.980 --> 01:41:58.540]   Weirdest thing is-- and OK, so then last night,
[01:41:58.540 --> 01:42:00.220]   it was the big UFC championship.
[01:42:00.220 --> 01:42:01.780]   But sure you watched that 145.
[01:42:01.780 --> 01:42:02.620]   I did not get a chance.
[01:42:02.620 --> 01:42:04.060]   Oh my god, it was amazing.
[01:42:04.060 --> 01:42:05.380]   But anyway--
[01:42:05.380 --> 01:42:08.860]   It's like John-- John Bones Jones versus Sugar or Shot Evans,
[01:42:08.860 --> 01:42:09.060]   right?
[01:42:09.060 --> 01:42:10.100]   Very good.
[01:42:10.100 --> 01:42:10.380]   I'm good.
[01:42:10.380 --> 01:42:12.180]   You are a UFC fan.
[01:42:12.180 --> 01:42:13.180]   I--
[01:42:13.180 --> 01:42:16.420]   And Jones, who actually weirdly has no calves in his legs.
[01:42:16.420 --> 01:42:18.420]   It's a very strange look.
[01:42:18.420 --> 01:42:19.620]   Kick the hell out of her shot.
[01:42:19.620 --> 01:42:21.900]   But anyway, that's another story for another day.
[01:42:21.900 --> 01:42:24.060]   But that was $60 pay per view.
[01:42:24.060 --> 01:42:24.700]   Yeah.
[01:42:24.700 --> 01:42:26.700]   $60.
[01:42:26.700 --> 01:42:28.140]   So they're watching YouTube.
[01:42:28.140 --> 01:42:30.060]   They're watching the $60 thing.
[01:42:30.060 --> 01:42:32.820]   And then there's kids sitting with their laptops.
[01:42:32.820 --> 01:42:35.180]   And they're watching more YouTube on the laptops.
[01:42:35.180 --> 01:42:37.260]   Well, the $60 pay per view is on.
[01:42:37.260 --> 01:42:38.060]   Yep.
[01:42:38.060 --> 01:42:41.100]   And I'm thinking, what a world.
[01:42:41.100 --> 01:42:42.740]   Well, you know, I mean, YouTube certainly
[01:42:42.740 --> 01:42:48.500]   hopes that this is the place where you can get free content that
[01:42:48.500 --> 01:42:51.660]   will compete with what Hulu and Netflix are trying to do.
[01:42:51.660 --> 01:42:53.940]   Instead of $7.99 a month, it'll be--
[01:42:53.940 --> 01:42:54.540]   Yeah.
[01:42:54.540 --> 01:42:57.180]   But OK, so how long is YouTube?
[01:42:57.180 --> 01:42:59.940]   You're just going to eschew what Netflix and Hulu are doing,
[01:42:59.940 --> 01:43:03.580]   which is the traditional 22-minute television show?
[01:43:03.580 --> 01:43:04.460]   Or whatever it is.
[01:43:04.460 --> 01:43:05.980]   Well, Google only cares about selling ads.
[01:43:05.980 --> 01:43:06.860]   They're putting ads in front of you.
[01:43:06.860 --> 01:43:07.820]   So they're not going to do--
[01:43:07.820 --> 01:43:10.100]   They're not going to see New Girl on YouTube.
[01:43:10.100 --> 01:43:11.580]   Or are you?
[01:43:11.580 --> 01:43:14.500]   I mean, it would surprise me if they want to do that.
[01:43:14.500 --> 01:43:16.740]   Although I think we are seeing a very--
[01:43:16.740 --> 01:43:18.340]   Wouldn't it have been a very interesting evolution
[01:43:18.340 --> 01:43:20.780]   if YouTube brought back Arrested Development
[01:43:20.780 --> 01:43:22.860]   and was a YouTube production?
[01:43:22.860 --> 01:43:24.060]   Wouldn't that have been interesting?
[01:43:24.060 --> 01:43:26.660]   I mean, you know, I think it's certainly within their power,
[01:43:26.660 --> 01:43:30.980]   if let's say, theoretically, somebody at YouTube had said,
[01:43:30.980 --> 01:43:33.780]   instead of dumping all this money into a lot of these other
[01:43:33.780 --> 01:43:36.820]   independent producers or established brand names
[01:43:36.820 --> 01:43:39.660]   to make YouTube videos, if they had brought back Firefly,
[01:43:39.660 --> 01:43:41.580]   you know, would that have been a very popular thing
[01:43:41.580 --> 01:43:43.140]   that they could put ads on?
[01:43:43.140 --> 01:43:44.580]   It would be interesting.
[01:43:44.580 --> 01:43:47.980]   Oh, you wrote on GigaOM about Google's dilemma.
[01:43:47.980 --> 01:43:52.380]   Which is, you know, the fact--
[01:43:52.380 --> 01:43:55.220]   And there's that New York Times article we talked about as well.
[01:43:55.220 --> 01:43:58.060]   Which is that you've got--
[01:43:58.060 --> 01:44:00.500]   You're in a landscape with aggressive, well-funded,
[01:44:00.500 --> 01:44:04.020]   big competitors, and you're trying to do no evil.
[01:44:04.020 --> 01:44:05.780]   It doesn't work.
[01:44:05.780 --> 01:44:08.540]   Well, I think they have a lot of challenges.
[01:44:08.540 --> 01:44:10.940]   So they have to go into different markets.
[01:44:10.940 --> 01:44:15.380]   You know, they have Facebook and Apple and Amazon
[01:44:15.380 --> 01:44:18.700]   all pushing and pulling them in different directions.
[01:44:18.700 --> 01:44:20.540]   And they have to compete with them.
[01:44:20.540 --> 01:44:24.300]   I think-- and all this is a new competitive landscape for them.
[01:44:24.300 --> 01:44:30.220]   So it's Google+, and you know, Google+, I'm not even sure
[01:44:30.220 --> 01:44:31.900]   what problem it solves for me.
[01:44:31.900 --> 01:44:36.220]   I don't think I have a problem with Facebook or Twitter.
[01:44:36.220 --> 01:44:38.540]   I have a problem using those things.
[01:44:38.540 --> 01:44:42.220]   I don't have a problem, per se, in that service.
[01:44:42.220 --> 01:44:43.860]   I don't have time.
[01:44:43.860 --> 01:44:45.460]   It's the Windows Phone problem.
[01:44:45.460 --> 01:44:48.380]   It doesn't answer a need.
[01:44:48.380 --> 01:44:48.940]   Exactly.
[01:44:48.940 --> 01:44:52.180]   And I think that's-- so it's solving Google's problems.
[01:44:52.180 --> 01:44:56.140]   And I think that's what I mean by company doing unnatural things.
[01:44:56.140 --> 01:45:00.100]   Google core competency was, you go there,
[01:45:00.100 --> 01:45:03.140]   look for a make a query and go elsewhere.
[01:45:03.140 --> 01:45:06.300]   That was the behavior on Google.
[01:45:06.300 --> 01:45:09.900]   And that behavior turned Google into a mega-billion dollar
[01:45:09.900 --> 01:45:10.540]   corporation.
[01:45:10.540 --> 01:45:15.100]   Because it created a lot of happy people everywhere you go.
[01:45:15.100 --> 01:45:18.860]   Everybody started using the idea of Google it.
[01:45:18.860 --> 01:45:24.020]   The Google it became-- it changed how society behaved.
[01:45:24.020 --> 01:45:28.860]   It stopped bookmarking our whole behavior towards information
[01:45:28.860 --> 01:45:30.420]   changed, how we consumed it.
[01:45:30.420 --> 01:45:32.180]   Now they have a different problem.
[01:45:32.180 --> 01:45:35.820]   And I don't think they are looking at it
[01:45:35.820 --> 01:45:38.460]   in a very rational manner, in my opinion.
[01:45:38.460 --> 01:45:40.740]   Instead of solving their customers' problems.
[01:45:40.740 --> 01:45:42.660]   They're solving their own problems.
[01:45:42.660 --> 01:45:43.740]   Any good company would do.
[01:45:43.740 --> 01:45:45.020]   They're solving their own problems.
[01:45:45.020 --> 01:45:47.020]   And nobody wants the solution.
[01:45:47.020 --> 01:45:50.540]   And right now, they have gone from being a company whose main
[01:45:50.540 --> 01:45:54.300]   customer was you and I, to a company whose main customer
[01:45:54.300 --> 01:45:55.780]   is the advertiser.
[01:45:55.780 --> 01:45:57.300]   So I think there is that--
[01:45:57.300 --> 01:45:57.820]   Very hard.
[01:45:57.820 --> 01:46:00.340]   --poition for, which does exist.
[01:46:00.340 --> 01:46:01.340]   And they have to do it.
[01:46:01.340 --> 01:46:03.140]   It's not like they have a choice.
[01:46:03.140 --> 01:46:05.140]   Because they have a publicly traded company.
[01:46:05.140 --> 01:46:06.700]   They need to make money.
[01:46:06.700 --> 01:46:07.820]   They need to have earnings.
[01:46:07.820 --> 01:46:09.460]   They need to show growth.
[01:46:09.460 --> 01:46:11.900]   If they don't have growth, the stocks can fall.
[01:46:11.900 --> 01:46:12.900]   Stocks can fall.
[01:46:12.900 --> 01:46:14.540]   Engineers are going to leave.
[01:46:14.540 --> 01:46:16.100]   Et cetera, et cetera.
[01:46:16.100 --> 01:46:18.260]   It is a dilemma for them.
[01:46:18.260 --> 01:46:20.860]   Is this another form of the innovators dilemma, really?
[01:46:20.860 --> 01:46:21.140]   Yeah.
[01:46:21.140 --> 01:46:23.180]   It's essentially what it is.
[01:46:23.180 --> 01:46:26.900]   The interesting part with Google is it's facing innovators
[01:46:26.900 --> 01:46:29.180]   dilemma in less than a decade.
[01:46:29.180 --> 01:46:29.940]   I know.
[01:46:29.940 --> 01:46:30.940]   Amazing.
[01:46:30.940 --> 01:46:31.460]   Yeah.
[01:46:31.460 --> 01:46:34.380]   That's what I meant earlier, that the internet and the
[01:46:34.380 --> 01:46:39.300]   connectivity has changed the metabolism of the technology
[01:46:39.300 --> 01:46:40.180]   industry.
[01:46:40.180 --> 01:46:41.580]   And Google, you're seeing it.
[01:46:41.580 --> 01:46:45.980]   I mean, I don't think Facebook can assume that they're going
[01:46:45.980 --> 01:46:49.020]   to be the king of the web five years from now.
[01:46:49.020 --> 01:46:50.660]   They cannot assume that.
[01:46:50.660 --> 01:46:53.020]   Because things could just so radically change.
[01:46:53.020 --> 01:46:55.860]   Look, Google was started in our time.
[01:46:55.860 --> 01:47:01.980]   Like, we all saw it come out of nowhere and become this giant.
[01:47:01.980 --> 01:47:05.340]   And now they're suffering from innovators dilemma.
[01:47:05.340 --> 01:47:09.180]   Like, they're doing all these interesting things, except, you
[01:47:09.180 --> 01:47:12.300]   know, they're not really that interesting in a larger scheme
[01:47:12.300 --> 01:47:14.380]   of things as they are a bigger company.
[01:47:14.380 --> 01:47:16.420]   I think it'll be an interesting one to see what happens.
[01:47:16.420 --> 01:47:21.540]   I wish they would put more resources towards YouTube, in
[01:47:21.540 --> 01:47:22.500]   my opinion.
[01:47:22.500 --> 01:47:25.860]   I think YouTube is like an undervalued asset they have.
[01:47:25.860 --> 01:47:29.060]   Just like, I think they need to kind of get really serious
[01:47:29.060 --> 01:47:29.980]   about Android.
[01:47:29.980 --> 01:47:34.060]   They should stop mocking about Google+ and things like that
[01:47:34.060 --> 01:47:38.020]   and focus on Android and YouTube and a couple of places
[01:47:38.020 --> 01:47:39.740]   where they're succeeding right now.
[01:47:39.740 --> 01:47:44.300]   It's funny because I've said they should get rid of YouTube
[01:47:44.300 --> 01:47:46.660]   because to me, it's a channel conflict.
[01:47:46.660 --> 01:47:50.540]   Because they, in search, they favor their own products.
[01:47:50.540 --> 01:47:53.620]   And as somebody who competes with YouTube, that's a problem
[01:47:53.620 --> 01:47:56.700]   for me in search, right?
[01:47:56.700 --> 01:47:57.780]   And so-- but you're right.
[01:47:57.780 --> 01:48:01.180]   I mean, if you look at what their assets are, you can start
[01:48:01.180 --> 01:48:05.780]   to replace search with YouTube and a few other products.
[01:48:05.780 --> 01:48:08.700]   But search is starting to give way.
[01:48:08.700 --> 01:48:12.820]   What's funny is that during the Oracle Google trial, which
[01:48:12.820 --> 01:48:17.700]   happened last week, also, Larry Page said that Android was
[01:48:17.700 --> 01:48:21.500]   merely a vehicle to deliver Google's advertising service.
[01:48:21.500 --> 01:48:23.900]   That was kind of a self-serving--
[01:48:23.900 --> 01:48:26.820]   He said it was he didn't consider Android to be
[01:48:26.820 --> 01:48:34.940]   critical to Google, which just is either a lie or it's
[01:48:34.940 --> 01:48:37.940]   astonishing in its naivete of what's
[01:48:37.940 --> 01:48:40.300]   happening in personal technology.
[01:48:40.300 --> 01:48:42.500]   It's exactly the opposite of what you just said on, which
[01:48:42.500 --> 01:48:46.180]   is that Android is one of their crown jewels.
[01:48:46.180 --> 01:48:49.060]   I mean, it is for ads, right?
[01:48:49.060 --> 01:48:50.340]   I mean, that's not--
[01:48:50.340 --> 01:48:51.460]   That's not inaccurate.
[01:48:51.460 --> 01:48:53.540]   But saying it's not an important--
[01:48:53.540 --> 01:48:55.060]   is that a big deal?
[01:48:55.060 --> 01:48:59.140]   Well, that's-- I mean, then why do they go and buy Motorola?
[01:48:59.140 --> 01:48:59.620]   I don't know.
[01:48:59.620 --> 01:49:00.380]   It's fascinating.
[01:49:00.380 --> 01:49:01.620]   We live in a very interesting--
[01:49:01.620 --> 01:49:04.580]   I want to take a break, because like Google, I don't really
[01:49:04.580 --> 01:49:05.300]   care about our audience.
[01:49:05.300 --> 01:49:06.460]   I care about our advertisers.
[01:49:06.460 --> 01:49:07.460]   Oh, here we go.
[01:49:07.460 --> 01:49:08.460]   I am going to--
[01:49:08.460 --> 01:49:09.060]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:49:09.060 --> 01:49:11.100]   I'm going to--
[01:49:11.100 --> 01:49:12.740]   Grow up, kids.
[01:49:12.740 --> 01:49:14.260]   How do you think you put the--
[01:49:14.260 --> 01:49:16.100]   Anything you put the data on the table.
[01:49:16.100 --> 01:49:18.940]   How do you think I paid for $60 UFC tickets?
[01:49:18.940 --> 01:49:20.460]   I can tell you right now.
[01:49:20.460 --> 01:49:22.340]   There's another paper view coming up.
[01:49:22.340 --> 01:49:23.180]   Exactly.
[01:49:23.180 --> 01:49:23.820]   No.
[01:49:23.820 --> 01:49:24.780]   Moving subs.
[01:49:24.780 --> 01:49:25.940]   We do care about our audience.
[01:49:25.940 --> 01:49:27.820]   That's why we only do four commercials instead of how
[01:49:27.820 --> 01:49:30.900]   many would there be if this were broadcast 30 or 40?
[01:49:30.900 --> 01:49:32.100]   Absolutely.
[01:49:32.100 --> 01:49:33.860]   I do want to mention Audible.com.
[01:49:33.860 --> 01:49:36.700]   The truth is, frankly, if I were smart,
[01:49:36.700 --> 01:49:38.580]   I would not do ads for this company,
[01:49:38.580 --> 01:49:43.700]   because we lose listeners every week to Audible.com.
[01:49:43.700 --> 01:49:44.500]   It's nuts.
[01:49:44.500 --> 01:49:44.940]   Yeah.
[01:49:44.940 --> 01:49:46.100]   This is such a great thing.
[01:49:46.100 --> 01:49:49.580]   This is the audiobooks, 100,000 books.
[01:49:49.580 --> 01:49:51.140]   Instead of listening to podcasts,
[01:49:51.140 --> 01:49:52.860]   you're probably listening to books now.
[01:49:52.860 --> 01:49:55.780]   In fact, you're not even hearing this ad.
[01:49:55.780 --> 01:49:56.780]   Because you love Audible.
[01:49:56.780 --> 01:49:59.060]   Now, if you are hearing this ad, then this is your last chance.
[01:49:59.060 --> 01:50:00.580]   Because you've got to listen to Audible.
[01:50:00.580 --> 01:50:01.860]   I got two books for you.
[01:50:01.860 --> 01:50:03.260]   So no, I mean, I don't have two picks.
[01:50:03.260 --> 01:50:04.420]   Maybe you guys can help me.
[01:50:04.420 --> 01:50:05.220]   Sure.
[01:50:05.220 --> 01:50:06.540]   Definitely.
[01:50:06.540 --> 01:50:08.020]   This is something you want to take a look at.
[01:50:08.020 --> 01:50:09.060]   Two books for free.
[01:50:09.060 --> 01:50:12.820]   If you go to Audible.com/twit, the number two,
[01:50:12.820 --> 01:50:14.380]   you'll sign up for the platinum plan that's
[01:50:14.380 --> 01:50:16.580]   two books a month, first month's free, first two books
[01:50:16.580 --> 01:50:16.940]   are free.
[01:50:16.940 --> 01:50:18.060]   They're yours to keep forever.
[01:50:18.060 --> 01:50:20.700]   Cancel at any time.
[01:50:20.700 --> 01:50:22.020]   But what do you want to listen to?
[01:50:22.020 --> 01:50:22.860]   That's the question.
[01:50:22.860 --> 01:50:23.900]   There's so many good choices.
[01:50:23.900 --> 01:50:25.940]   I'll tell you what, I, over the last couple months,
[01:50:25.940 --> 01:50:28.820]   have you just completely torn up the song, "Nice and Fire?"
[01:50:28.820 --> 01:50:30.380]   I've listened to the first two.
[01:50:30.380 --> 01:50:31.620]   How many of they're five, right?
[01:50:31.620 --> 01:50:33.820]   Yeah, I'm on the final or the most recent one.
[01:50:33.820 --> 01:50:37.780]   Not the final one, but the most recent dance of or with dragons.
[01:50:37.780 --> 01:50:41.100]   So there's Game of Thrones, which has already been on HBO.
[01:50:41.100 --> 01:50:42.660]   Now HBO's doing Clash of Kings.
[01:50:42.660 --> 01:50:43.100]   Clash of Kings.
[01:50:43.100 --> 01:50:44.260]   That's book two.
[01:50:44.260 --> 01:50:46.220]   Next, I presume they're going to keep doing all of them.
[01:50:46.220 --> 01:50:47.340]   Because it's a hit.
[01:50:47.340 --> 01:50:48.700]   Storm of Swords, Feats for Crows.
[01:50:48.700 --> 01:50:50.420]   But that's been greenlit by HBO.
[01:50:50.420 --> 01:50:51.580]   So season three's been greenlit.
[01:50:51.580 --> 01:50:54.020]   That week, Clash of Kings.
[01:50:54.020 --> 01:50:55.020]   Dance with Dragons.
[01:50:55.020 --> 01:50:56.180]   Yeah, dance with Dragons.
[01:50:56.180 --> 01:50:57.300]   And that's what you're listening to.
[01:50:57.300 --> 01:50:58.860]   Now rated by Rolly DeTries.
[01:50:58.860 --> 01:51:00.700]   Yeah, he came back and did that, didn't he?
[01:51:00.700 --> 01:51:01.460]   Good man.
[01:51:01.460 --> 01:51:04.060]   Yeah, yeah, they're fantastic.
[01:51:04.060 --> 01:51:06.180]   I'll tell you what, take it from me, folks.
[01:51:06.180 --> 01:51:09.220]   I was, as a Twit listener, got on Audible.
[01:51:09.220 --> 01:51:10.380]   And I haven't looked back.
[01:51:10.380 --> 01:51:12.300]   I've been a super happy subscriber.
[01:51:12.300 --> 01:51:12.780]   It's been really--
[01:51:12.780 --> 01:51:14.420]   And he hasn't listened to Twit in months.
[01:51:14.420 --> 01:51:14.940]   No.
[01:51:14.940 --> 01:51:15.260]   As a result.
[01:51:15.260 --> 01:51:16.220]   I didn't even listen to myself.
[01:51:16.220 --> 01:51:16.620]   Yeah.
[01:51:16.620 --> 01:51:17.220]   Who has time?
[01:51:17.220 --> 01:51:18.540]   There's too many great books.
[01:51:18.540 --> 01:51:20.100]   This is two credits Game of Thrones.
[01:51:20.100 --> 01:51:23.020]   So if you haven't started this yet, this is perfect.
[01:51:23.020 --> 01:51:27.380]   You can get that for free at audible.com/twit2.
[01:51:27.380 --> 01:51:29.940]   They've really done a great job on sci-fi and fantasy.
[01:51:29.940 --> 01:51:31.940]   But they've also got bestsellers.
[01:51:31.940 --> 01:51:35.180]   I'm listening to a wonderful novel right now
[01:51:35.180 --> 01:51:37.460]   by Anne Patrick called A State of Wonder
[01:51:37.460 --> 01:51:39.700]   that it's kind of like--
[01:51:39.700 --> 01:51:41.700]   you must have loved Life of Pi.
[01:51:41.700 --> 01:51:43.940]   Everybody's read Life of Pi, I hope.
[01:51:43.940 --> 01:51:45.380]   If you haven't read Life of Pi--
[01:51:45.380 --> 01:51:46.380]   Uh.
[01:51:46.380 --> 01:51:47.860]   Oh.
[01:51:47.860 --> 01:51:49.740]   You will cry your eyes out at the end of this book.
[01:51:49.740 --> 01:51:50.240]   Really?
[01:51:50.240 --> 01:51:51.260]   Oh, yeah.
[01:51:51.260 --> 01:51:52.580]   I saw it deadly, though.
[01:51:52.580 --> 01:51:56.780]   Well, even for somebody like you, who's a lifeless zombie--
[01:51:56.780 --> 01:51:57.580]   An automaton.
[01:51:57.580 --> 01:51:58.380]   A golem, really.
[01:51:58.380 --> 01:51:59.420]   A golem.
[01:51:59.420 --> 01:52:02.900]   You will love this because this is one of the most
[01:52:02.900 --> 01:52:03.940]   beautiful books.
[01:52:03.940 --> 01:52:06.660]   If you saw the movie, forget everything you saw
[01:52:06.660 --> 01:52:07.900]   and listen to this book.
[01:52:07.900 --> 01:52:09.780]   And it's beautifully performed by Jeff Woodman.
[01:52:09.780 --> 01:52:11.780]   I just loved this book.
[01:52:11.780 --> 01:52:15.180]   The Alchemist, there's another classic, Paul Quayla.
[01:52:15.180 --> 01:52:16.060]   Watership Down.
[01:52:16.060 --> 01:52:17.260]   Look at there's so many great books.
[01:52:17.260 --> 01:52:20.100]   I want you to go right now to audible.com/twit2,
[01:52:20.100 --> 01:52:24.140]   pick two, make them your life.
[01:52:24.140 --> 01:52:27.660]   And give your life to audible.
[01:52:27.660 --> 01:52:28.660]   It's the only thing to do.
[01:52:28.660 --> 01:52:30.020]   That is the only way.
[01:52:30.020 --> 01:52:31.100]   Yes.
[01:52:31.100 --> 01:52:31.700]   You do read.
[01:52:31.700 --> 01:52:33.220]   You're good.
[01:52:33.220 --> 01:52:35.260]   You surprise me because just to remember--
[01:52:35.260 --> 01:52:35.660]   Really?
[01:52:35.660 --> 01:52:39.660]   Because I see you as the buffoon that you appear to be
[01:52:39.660 --> 01:52:40.180]   on NSFW.
[01:52:40.180 --> 01:52:41.260]   Of course, yes to.
[01:52:41.260 --> 01:52:43.020]   But in fact, when you do those readings,
[01:52:43.020 --> 01:52:43.660]   you come alive.
[01:52:43.660 --> 01:52:44.700]   You're an actor.
[01:52:44.700 --> 01:52:45.700]   Oh, no.
[01:52:45.700 --> 01:52:47.220]   Yeah, I try to be silly.
[01:52:47.220 --> 01:52:47.720]   You know?
[01:52:47.720 --> 01:52:48.220]   I do.
[01:52:48.220 --> 01:52:49.220]   But you're an actor.
[01:52:49.220 --> 01:52:50.220]   And you do those--
[01:52:50.220 --> 01:52:52.940]   People should listen to your podcast WeirdThings.com.
[01:52:52.940 --> 01:52:53.940]   Weird-- yeah, weird things.
[01:52:53.940 --> 01:52:56.820]   And I mean, NSFW, of course, on the Twit Network.
[01:52:56.820 --> 01:53:00.380]   Let me also point out that if you enjoyed any of the conversation
[01:53:00.380 --> 01:53:03.300]   that we had about Netflix and the future of online video
[01:53:03.300 --> 01:53:03.900]   frame rate--
[01:53:03.900 --> 01:53:04.380]   Frame rate.
[01:53:04.380 --> 01:53:06.980]   --with Tom Merritt and Brian Brushwood is fantastic.
[01:53:06.980 --> 01:53:06.980]   Very good.
[01:53:06.980 --> 01:53:07.480]   Very good.
[01:53:07.480 --> 01:53:08.460]   I love that show.
[01:53:08.460 --> 01:53:11.020]   But I wish more people listen to this.
[01:53:11.020 --> 01:53:11.420]   Yeah.
[01:53:11.420 --> 01:53:13.020]   They're all listening to audible books now.
[01:53:13.020 --> 01:53:15.540]   They're all-- yeah, they're listening to Roy DeTries.
[01:53:15.540 --> 01:53:17.620]   They just pretend that Tom's Roy DeTries.
[01:53:17.620 --> 01:53:19.020]   You got a new show?
[01:53:19.020 --> 01:53:19.860]   Yes.
[01:53:19.860 --> 01:53:23.380]   Speaking of audio books, Andrew Maine's stories.
[01:53:23.380 --> 01:53:26.940]   My friend and business partner Andrew Maine is a writer.
[01:53:26.940 --> 01:53:30.260]   Public Enemy Zero is probably his most popular book,
[01:53:30.260 --> 01:53:31.180]   which actually was--
[01:53:31.180 --> 01:53:31.940]   Incredible.
[01:53:31.940 --> 01:53:33.260]   --just optioned--
[01:53:33.260 --> 01:53:33.740]   Was it?
[01:53:33.740 --> 01:53:34.220]   Yeah, feature film.
[01:53:34.220 --> 01:53:35.380]   Oh, they make a great movie.
[01:53:35.380 --> 01:53:36.460]   Feature film rights.
[01:53:36.460 --> 01:53:37.020]   I can't--
[01:53:37.020 --> 01:53:40.060]   I don't know at what stage the signatures are at,
[01:53:40.060 --> 01:53:47.180]   but a producer who has produced a franchise of very successful
[01:53:47.180 --> 01:53:51.260]   summer movies is hoping to transform that book into a movie.
[01:53:51.260 --> 01:53:53.380]   America, a movie.
[01:53:53.380 --> 01:53:55.220]   And I really--
[01:53:55.220 --> 01:53:57.180]   I'm very excited about it.
[01:53:57.180 --> 01:53:58.420]   But check that out.
[01:53:58.420 --> 01:54:01.980]   Andrew Maine's stories is me reading original short stories
[01:54:01.980 --> 01:54:03.380]   from Andrew Maine every single week.
[01:54:03.380 --> 01:54:06.940]   So download that podcast on iTunes right now.
[01:54:06.940 --> 01:54:09.820]   Or if you like reading things, Angel Keller is his new book.
[01:54:09.820 --> 01:54:12.260]   That's available on Amazon for only $0.99.
[01:54:12.260 --> 01:54:13.940]   And this is going to be a plug for you.
[01:54:13.940 --> 01:54:15.780]   And you've suddenly made it an Andrew Maine plug.
[01:54:15.780 --> 01:54:16.540]   That's all the same.
[01:54:16.540 --> 01:54:17.900]   You're a nice guy.
[01:54:17.900 --> 01:54:19.500]   Are you actually Andrew Maine?
[01:54:19.500 --> 01:54:19.980]   Maybe.
[01:54:19.980 --> 01:54:20.540]   Yeah.
[01:54:20.540 --> 01:54:21.620]   Probably not.
[01:54:21.620 --> 01:54:22.540]   He's much taller.
[01:54:22.540 --> 01:54:24.860]   Oh, Malek Blogs at gigaohm.com.
[01:54:24.860 --> 01:54:28.060]   And his own personal blog, which is the best design
[01:54:28.060 --> 01:54:30.540]   blog in the world, om.co.
[01:54:30.540 --> 01:54:30.980]   I love it.
[01:54:30.980 --> 01:54:32.260]   Thank you.
[01:54:32.260 --> 01:54:33.420]   I'm glad you like that.
[01:54:33.420 --> 01:54:34.980]   Oh, I love what you did.
[01:54:34.980 --> 01:54:36.940]   In fact, when we started--
[01:54:36.940 --> 01:54:38.260]   whoops, I got the wrong one.
[01:54:38.260 --> 01:54:41.340]   I got the-- for some reason, I got the NASDAQ.
[01:54:41.340 --> 01:54:43.220]   O-M-O-N-R-Co.co.
[01:54:43.220 --> 01:54:45.380]   Oh, if you do the.com, you get the NASDAQ.
[01:54:45.380 --> 01:54:46.740]   That's interesting.
[01:54:46.740 --> 01:54:48.780]   I've been trying to get that for so long.
[01:54:48.780 --> 01:54:51.780]   But that Co is nice and short.
[01:54:51.780 --> 01:54:53.220]   And it's a personal blog.
[01:54:53.220 --> 01:54:54.300]   It's beautiful.
[01:54:54.300 --> 01:54:54.860]   It's just cool.
[01:54:54.860 --> 01:54:55.700]   That's great.
[01:54:55.700 --> 01:54:57.780]   Isn't that nice?
[01:54:57.780 --> 01:54:58.380]   Very nice.
[01:54:58.380 --> 01:55:01.740]   Anyway, Om, it's so wonderful to have you here.
[01:55:01.740 --> 01:55:02.340]   You're so smart.
[01:55:02.340 --> 01:55:04.580]   We didn't even talk about James Cameron
[01:55:04.580 --> 01:55:07.060]   and what he's going to do with Google.
[01:55:07.060 --> 01:55:08.780]   You did an interview with him.
[01:55:08.780 --> 01:55:10.620]   And not me, one of our writers did.
[01:55:10.620 --> 01:55:11.780]   OK.
[01:55:11.780 --> 01:55:12.460]   I love her.
[01:55:12.460 --> 01:55:13.380]   He's pretty awesome.
[01:55:13.380 --> 01:55:14.740]   Yeah.
[01:55:14.740 --> 01:55:18.420]   Yeah, and Cameron's going to do something with the Google.
[01:55:18.420 --> 01:55:21.660]   Well, it's Google guys, Peter DeAmanthus from the X Prize.
[01:55:21.660 --> 01:55:23.340]   And they're going to announce--
[01:55:23.340 --> 01:55:24.980]   I mean, what everybody kind of suspects
[01:55:24.980 --> 01:55:29.300]   will be asteroid mining, which would be amazing.
[01:55:29.300 --> 01:55:30.620]   That is the future, by the way.
[01:55:30.620 --> 01:55:33.300]   I've been saying that for years.
[01:55:33.300 --> 01:55:34.900]   No, really.
[01:55:34.900 --> 01:55:36.700]   Anyway, Om, thank you for being here.
[01:55:36.700 --> 01:55:39.420]   Thanks for Giga Om, and thanks for Om.co.
[01:55:39.420 --> 01:55:39.940]   OK.
[01:55:39.940 --> 01:55:40.620]   Thank you.
[01:55:40.620 --> 01:55:41.260]   Great to have you.
[01:55:41.260 --> 01:55:43.780]   I'll talk to you soon.
[01:55:43.780 --> 01:55:44.620]   Soon.
[01:55:44.620 --> 01:55:45.220]   And enjoy that.
[01:55:45.220 --> 01:55:46.220]   Thank you for having me on the show.
[01:55:46.220 --> 01:55:47.660]   Always a pleasure.
[01:55:47.660 --> 01:55:48.380]   Take care.
[01:55:48.380 --> 01:55:52.860]   Mr. Dwight Silverman is at blogs.cron.com.
[01:55:52.860 --> 01:55:54.380]   And the host of--
[01:55:54.380 --> 01:55:56.780]   he's the Houston Chronicle Tech Blogger,
[01:55:56.780 --> 01:55:58.100]   and also the host of technology
[01:55:58.100 --> 01:56:01.980]   bytes in the Pacifica radio network down there in Houston.
[01:56:01.980 --> 01:56:02.740]   Yep.
[01:56:02.740 --> 01:56:05.980]   That airs Wednesday night at kpft.org,
[01:56:05.980 --> 01:56:08.060]   90.1 FM if you're here in Houston.
[01:56:08.060 --> 01:56:10.780]   I just want to say, Leo, I really appreciate you having me
[01:56:10.780 --> 01:56:13.780]   on every time, but particularly getting a chance
[01:56:13.780 --> 01:56:16.860]   to be on with Om, who I have admired for years and years.
[01:56:16.860 --> 01:56:19.540]   We've talked a couple of times on the phone.
[01:56:19.540 --> 01:56:24.660]   And it's been one of my hopes that I'd get a chance
[01:56:24.660 --> 01:56:25.500]   to do it with him.
[01:56:25.500 --> 01:56:27.100]   And I appreciate you making that happen.
[01:56:27.100 --> 01:56:28.420]   Oh, I feel the same way.
[01:56:28.420 --> 01:56:29.940]   I always just thrill to have Om on,
[01:56:29.940 --> 01:56:31.380]   and I'm glad I get you two together.
[01:56:31.380 --> 01:56:32.500]   You guys are so kind.
[01:56:32.500 --> 01:56:33.340]   Thank you.
[01:56:33.340 --> 01:56:38.300]   You are the kind of the Emanos Grease.
[01:56:38.300 --> 01:56:39.980]   No, that's the wrong phrase.
[01:56:39.980 --> 01:56:43.260]   But you are the eminent Om Malek.
[01:56:43.260 --> 01:56:47.700]   I just feel terrible taking air time away from Dwight and Om.
[01:56:47.700 --> 01:56:51.100]   Because if Leo, if you're the Yoda of tech
[01:56:51.100 --> 01:56:53.980]   and Om is the Obi-Wan Kenobi, then I'm the Jar Jar Binks.
[01:56:53.980 --> 01:56:54.700]   That's right.
[01:56:54.700 --> 01:56:56.300]   That's exactly right.
[01:56:56.300 --> 01:56:57.460]   That's exactly right.
[01:56:57.460 --> 01:56:57.980]   That's very good.
[01:56:57.980 --> 01:56:59.460]   Do I get to be the Darth Maul?
[01:56:59.460 --> 01:57:00.460]   Yes.
[01:57:00.460 --> 01:57:01.060]   There you go.
[01:57:01.060 --> 01:57:02.660]   Do a little of the fates.
[01:57:02.660 --> 01:57:04.020]   Hey, let's find out what's coming up.
[01:57:04.020 --> 01:57:05.100]   We've got a big week ahead.
[01:57:05.100 --> 01:57:08.540]   Tom Merritt in our TNT newsroom has the week ahead.
[01:57:08.540 --> 01:57:09.540]   Hey, thanks, Leo.
[01:57:09.540 --> 01:57:11.420]   Here's some of the stories we'll be keeping an eye on
[01:57:11.420 --> 01:57:13.420]   in the week ahead on Tech News today.
[01:57:13.420 --> 01:57:17.100]   Monday, April 23, the Intel-powered Lava Zolo,

[01:57:19.900 --> 01:57:22.180]   goes on sale in India for 22,000 rupees.
[01:57:22.180 --> 01:57:23.420]   So what's on Netflix?
[01:57:23.420 --> 01:57:24.860]   That's a good news report on Monday.
[01:57:24.860 --> 01:57:28.540]   Tuesday, April 24, Google I/O kicks off down in the peninsula.
[01:57:28.540 --> 01:57:30.580]   And Apple has their earnings report.
[01:57:30.580 --> 01:57:33.820]   Wednesday, April 25, the next web kicks off.
[01:57:33.820 --> 01:57:36.620]   And the HTC One S hits the shelves.
[01:57:36.620 --> 01:57:37.100]   That's nice.
[01:57:37.100 --> 01:57:38.100]   Thursday, April 26.
[01:57:38.100 --> 01:57:41.620]   Max Payne Mobile comes to Android and Amazon and Zinga
[01:57:41.620 --> 01:57:42.860]   have their earnings report.
[01:57:42.860 --> 01:57:43.940]   It's an earnings week.
[01:57:43.940 --> 01:57:48.300]   And Friday, April 27, the Kindle Touch touches down in Europe.
[01:57:48.300 --> 01:57:49.420]   Let's look at the week ahead.
[01:57:49.420 --> 01:57:49.980]   Back to you, Leo.
[01:57:49.980 --> 01:57:51.940]   The Lava Zolo.
[01:57:51.940 --> 01:57:53.020]   Is that like Yolo?
[01:57:53.020 --> 01:57:54.620]   What the hell?
[01:57:54.620 --> 01:57:56.420]   I thought when RT was a bad name.
[01:57:56.420 --> 01:57:57.500]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:57:57.500 --> 01:57:58.780]   All right.
[01:57:58.780 --> 01:58:00.420]   Tech News today, by the way, is--
[01:58:00.420 --> 01:58:01.260]   Great show.
[01:58:01.260 --> 01:58:02.660]   By addiction.
[01:58:02.660 --> 01:58:05.620]   Every day, Monday through Friday, 3 PM Pacific, 6 PM Eastern
[01:58:05.620 --> 01:58:09.420]   time, you can tune in for your daily fix of Tech News with Tom

[01:58:11.620 --> 01:58:14.140]   It is a great team and a great show.
[01:58:14.140 --> 01:58:16.260]   We thank you for watching it.
[01:58:16.260 --> 01:58:17.500]   And we thank you for joining us.
[01:58:17.500 --> 01:58:20.540]   We do this show every Sunday afternoon, 3 PM Pacific, 6 PM
[01:58:20.540 --> 01:58:24.540]   Eastern time, 2,200 UTC at 2.TV.
[01:58:24.540 --> 01:58:27.500]   Sometimes I do it with a small dog in my life.
[01:58:27.500 --> 01:58:30.300]   For those of you listening, you'll never know why.
[01:58:30.300 --> 01:58:31.620]   Now, this is like-- you are like--
[01:58:31.620 --> 01:58:34.820]   Cilo Green has the cats on the voice.
[01:58:34.820 --> 01:58:36.340]   You have Aussie.
[01:58:36.340 --> 01:58:38.220]   Does Cilo hold a cat on the voice?
[01:58:38.220 --> 01:58:38.580]   That's his bit.
[01:58:38.580 --> 01:58:39.700]   You said a white cat.
[01:58:39.700 --> 01:58:41.060]   It's called Perfect Cat.
[01:58:41.060 --> 01:58:42.940]   Has a Twitter account as well.
[01:58:42.940 --> 01:58:43.420]   Yeah.
[01:58:43.420 --> 01:58:45.540]   Aussie is the real Aussie on Twitter.
[01:58:45.540 --> 01:58:46.140]   Here we go.
[01:58:46.140 --> 01:58:46.860]   Yeah.
[01:58:46.860 --> 01:58:48.540]   Because Aussie Osborn had that Aussie Osborn.
[01:58:48.540 --> 01:58:49.460]   So we are the real Aussie.
[01:58:49.460 --> 01:58:50.220]   The real Aussie.
[01:58:50.220 --> 01:58:50.740]   The real Aussie.
[01:58:50.740 --> 01:58:53.580]   Maybe you can acquire him for a billion dollars.
[01:58:53.580 --> 01:58:56.140]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:58:56.140 --> 01:58:58.020]   He used Veronica-- he used to hold him around this time.
[01:58:58.020 --> 01:59:01.380]   He's been actually totally listless and lifeless
[01:59:01.380 --> 01:59:01.980]   in the spawn of this--
[01:59:01.980 --> 01:59:02.980]   And you can blame him.
[01:59:02.980 --> 01:59:04.140]   Yeah.
[01:59:04.140 --> 01:59:04.620]   Don't worry.
[01:59:04.620 --> 01:59:05.900]   We'll find another woman to hold you.
[01:59:05.900 --> 01:59:06.100]   So--
[01:59:06.100 --> 01:59:08.420]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:59:08.420 --> 01:59:09.180]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:59:09.180 --> 01:59:11.500]   We'll see you next time, another Twit.
[01:59:11.500 --> 01:59:12.500]   This is in the cam.
[01:59:12.500 --> 01:59:13.500]   It's in the cam.
[01:59:13.500 --> 01:59:16.500]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:59:16.500 --> 01:59:17.500]   Do the Twit.
[01:59:17.500 --> 01:59:18.500]   All right.
[01:59:18.500 --> 01:59:20.500]   Do the Twit, baby.
[01:59:20.500 --> 01:59:21.500]   Do the Twit.
[01:59:21.500 --> 01:59:22.500]   All right.
