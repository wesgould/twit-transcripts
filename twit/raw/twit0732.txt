[00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:06.640]   Tech. I've only been doing this a couple of thousand times but I think I know the name of the
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.920]   show by now. You know who's here? I'm really thrilled that he's to have him here. We actually
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.920]   have a great panel. This is Matt Cutz. He is the administrator at the United States Digital Service
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.840]   in Washington DC. You know every time I'm out to recruit I come out a day early just so I can
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.160]   bless you Matt Cutz. First of all we always love having you on. Back when you were at Google you
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.680]   were the king of webmaster tools at Google and for longest time fighting spam in the Google search
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:37.440]   results employee 71 at Google took a leave of absence went to work for the government and it's
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.560]   stuck. It's stuck. I signed up for a three to six month tour and that was three plus years ago.
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.960]   I'm so glad. I'm so glad. Actually we'll talk a little more about the recruitment later in the
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:51.760]   show but this is a time for anybody who works for a tech company in Silicon Valley to put a little
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:57.360]   time into making the government work better for everyone. I know with some at least in Silicon
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.680]   Valley the current administration is not beloved but that doesn't mean that government doesn't have
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.520]   to continue do the job get it done. In fact all the more so. I'm really glad to have you out here.
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.840]   We'll give you a big plug in a little bit. Thank you. Also with us we love Denise Howell.
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:17.520]   She is a former host of this week in law. Are you going to keep that going a little bit or is that
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:22.720]   just kind of on hiatus now? I think it's kind of on hiatus now. I'm having a blast doing triangulation.
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:28.000]   We love you on triangulation. We desperately needed you and your insights so it's great to have you.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.560]   Denise is a longtime blogger with do you still do blogs and baggage or what was it?
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:41.680]   Bag and baggage was my blog that I started back in 2001 and no it is not no longer it is one of those
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:49.200]   bits of digital Flotsam and Jetsam on the internet now. That's how we met though. We were at Blog
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.880]   World you were sitting in front of me and I saw you blogging. It was a law blog and I thought oh I
[00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:00.960]   want to get to know this person and the rest is history so I'm thrilled to have you on Twitch
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:05.920]   as on a regular basis as well. It's wonderful to be here in such great company. We get a little
[00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.960]   of the twill in the Twit. I got some twill in my Twit. There's twill in my Twit.
[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:18.720]   And somebody who hasn't been here since the infamous Christmas episode, the Christmas episode
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:25.120]   with John C. de Vorac and Odocta, O.N. J. J. Stone. Thanks for dusting them off balls and
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:30.400]   bring me out to closet Uncle Leo. I missed you guys. We got them out of the closet. You put me on
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.480]   the shelf. Forgot all about me. We got new toys. I'm like what is going on?
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:41.120]   You should feel bad. You're hiring my doppelganger. I'm getting tweets.
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:46.080]   Wait a minute. Congratulations. I'm like when I thought we hired you you guys all look like
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.800]   wait a minute. That's what happens. That's what Twitter thinks anyway. You know me,
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:56.000]   Barretan, Dan, we are all the same person. Congratulations all around. I think we know the
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:03.440]   difference. And to be very fair, we did try to hire. We've tried several times to hire O.N. J. J. Stone.
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:08.480]   And he said I'm not leaving the area. And I expect what my kid. In effect when we were
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:13.120]   talking about aunt because aunt's a great photographer and a great tech writer. And he's been on our
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:18.320]   shows too. I said the same thing. I said he'll never leave North Carolina. But it turns out he's
[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:24.000]   very happy to take his family with him to get out of North Carolina. So yeah, we were thrilled to
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.320]   get our newest hire here along with Micah Sargent who was happy to leave Missouri apparently.
[00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:34.720]   Very excited. Happy congratulations for all that. But no one if you ever decide that the
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:39.360]   Mid-Atlantic states are not for you. You have a home here in Northern California.
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.400]   I appreciate it. I'm just going to come hang out on Highland days. I'm trying to get there
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.040]   for the next Christmas. Come back for the next one. Actually,
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:51.200]   I think Denise has already booked for the next one. Because I'd love to. I think so. I think
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:56.560]   it's all women this time. Oh, yeah. But then you shouldn't be on here. Then Lisa should run the show.
[00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:03.040]   We're going to call it a twin hashtag me too. And it's going to. Oh boy. No. No. That's just
[00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:09.360]   I'm just kidding. It's a joke. It's a joke. The sad part is you can't joke anymore. That's the
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:14.560]   one thing about this era that is killing me. Like even comedians are getting run through the mill
[00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:20.400]   about jokes. You go there to semi get insulted. That's the point of a comedian. Sometimes a joke
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:25.200]   is just a joke. Well, I've already said two politically incorrect things in the first minute of the show.
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:30.240]   So it's great start. Great start. You know, if you really want to get insulted, there's always
[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:34.560]   Twitter. So you guys pop right on there. You don't even need to leave your house. You can instantly
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:42.880]   get insulted. Did you know that Amazon has a team of tweeters to defend? Actually, this makes
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:47.520]   sense. I bet you more than Amazon does this, but we've only now learned about Amazon's
[00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:55.760]   special social media team. They they jump into action whenever somebody says, oh, the Amazon
[00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:01.920]   warehouse, it's a horrible place to work. They have hired a team of warehouse workers
[00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:08.800]   to come in and say, no, no, no, but business insiders article this week, Amazon's army of
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:15.600]   tweeting warehouse workers backfired spectacularly this week after a thread about working conditions
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:22.640]   went viral last year. Amazon enlisted a team of employees to write positive comments. They call
[00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:35.280]   them the FC fulfillment center ambassadors. But once it was discovered, it became kind of a
[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:41.840]   liability. It started with a Twitter thread earlier this week. Diana Wild responded incredulous
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:46.160]   incredulously to the Amazon news account inviting followers to tour a fulfillment center and see
[00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:51.920]   what our warehouses are really really like. She tweeted, not that anything on Twitter ever, you know,
[00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:57.760]   can be taken as fact, but really like because your workers are liars, you're not going to convince
[00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:01.280]   the working class that everything is fine by telling us where to avert our eyes. We already
[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:04.800]   know what it's like. Why don't you really treat workers better? You can afford it.
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:11.920]   And then the FC ambassadors leapt into action. Everything's fine. I don't think there's anything
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:18.000]   wrong with the money I make or the way I'm treated at work. Then other Twitter users began to mock
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   them and well, it's the Twitter garbage fire all over again. I don't even know why I brought it up
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.840]   except that you like this story, Owen. Why did you like this story?
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:37.600]   >> I love this story because Amazon is the new devil in America business. You need Amazon,
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:43.120]   we love Amazon. They're destroying companies left and right. Their shipping programs they
[00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:49.280]   have right now are sad. It sounds sad to say for UPS, they're crushing UPS. They're crushing
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:55.040]   the post office. They're whittling down prices and no one can do anything about it because you can't
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:59.600]   say no, you just have to say yes to what they're doing to you. And so-
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.200]   >> Isn't that a bad thing?
[00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:04.000]   >> Isn't that kind of the definition of monopoly?
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:12.640]   >> So it's a very bad thing. As they play the game to crush the postal system and UPS,
[00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:17.280]   all the while having people go buy your own truck and deliver for us and we're gonna pay you
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:20.960]   nothing and you're not gonna be unionized. And if we wanna cut you off, we cut you off.
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:25.280]   And all the things that they're doing, phenomenal business, the mindset and the capitalism.
[00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:31.040]   I love it. Okay, great. But the human being side of it, like instead of hiring an army full of
[00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:35.760]   people to tweet in a warehouse, how about you just set up an algorithm where you randomly give every
[00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:41.520]   employee one free hours paid work or one day off out of the month paid or something stupid like that,
[00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:44.400]   where everybody feels like during the lottery and they're gonna, I got paid day off this,
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:48.480]   but that's something to make people happy. This thing that you're trying to do does nothing for
[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:53.040]   you because everybody knows that you basically work for a slave ship when you're at Amazon.
[00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:56.080]   Now it's not slavery because you're working and you're getting paid and you chose that job.
[00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:57.040]   >> Yeah, you chose that job.
[00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:00.400]   >> When I go get a pedicure, I feel bad for the lady doing it. I think to myself-
[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:03.760]   >> But that didn't stop you from getting your toenails painted bright orange.
[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:08.320]   >> It did not. I thought to myself, she chose this life. It's not my fault, but at the same time-
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:10.400]   >> Has nothing to do with the Vietnam War.
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:17.600]   >> Amazon has the power to fix things in a way that's real and they choose not to because of
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:21.520]   profit margins and money. And I mean, how much money do you really need at the end of the day?
[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:25.600]   >> If you're keeping score, that's now three politically incorrect things I've said in the
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:28.480]   first 15 minutes. >> I'm trying to save you by talking over you.
[00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:30.160]   >> You're drinking game out of this. >> Yeah.
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:34.960]   >> Well, we'd all need to handle this. We'd have alcohol poisoning by the end of the show.
[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:39.280]   >> I've decided that I'm going to play the role of capitalist. I'll be like Mr. Moneybags with
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:45.040]   the white mustache here today for crying out loudo and they chose that work.
[00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:47.280]   >> No one's forcing them to show up every day.
[00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:52.160]   >> Hey, you get a 15 minute break and guess what? It takes you eight minutes to get to the bathroom
[00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:56.080]   when you're in the warehouse and by the time you get back you're two minutes late, you get docked for it.
[00:10:56.080 --> 00:11:02.080]   >> Well, that's what happened on Twitter was people started making up fake ambassador tweets.
[00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:05.920]   >> Oh, of course they did. >> Like this one, this is from Jose,
[00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:11.760]   Ambassador, Amazon FC Ambassador. Hi, I'm Kyle. I work at an Amazon fulfillment center and I love
[00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:17.600]   it. We don't get p-breaks, so I've gotten used to using diapers and my God, they're so comfortable.
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:20.560]   Also, I have grandkids even though I have the profile pic of a 20 year old.
[00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:26.480]   And on and on and on. And that's actually, that is, I have to say, the best way for Twitter
[00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:30.560]   to deal with this kind of stuff is with humor. >> Skewer, yeah, absolutely.
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:35.200]   >> A little satire never hurt anything. It's always good. It's a good way to bite back.
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:35.600]   >> Yeah.
[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:43.680]   Anyway, I would guess I'd be shocked in fact if most companies don't have an army of people,
[00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:51.040]   we have a social media team putting out stuff. They do not respond to criticism though. I don't
[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:57.120]   have them seeking out people saying bad things and responding to that. They mostly just tweet
[00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:00.960]   out, here's what's going on today at the show, right? >> It's different.
[00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:08.240]   >> This feels like a step beyond PR. I couldn't believe that Mary Hanbury, who wrote this up for
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:13.920]   Business Insider, just left on the table the opportunity to coin the term warehouse washing,
[00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:17.440]   which is what this feels like. >> Credit Denise Howell.
[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:24.720]   Warehouse washing, I like it. >> Well, and I've heard of a few folks on Twitter who were like,
[00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:29.600]   "Oh, well, Amazon offered to let me tour their fulfillment center." And it did defuse the anger,
[00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:34.640]   but then as soon as people realize that everybody's getting that cookie cutter approach, that's just
[00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:35.920]   going to backfire again. >> Yeah.
[00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:41.200]   >> So I think that's the first lesson. Any company learns about Twitter is it has to be authentic.
[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:45.360]   >> Yeah, you can't fake that well. >> If it's BS, people see through that so fast,
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:48.560]   they know they're being manipulated or tempted to manipulate. >> Right.
[00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:53.600]   >> Unless you're a Russian troll factory and then nobody sees through it at all.
[00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:58.080]   >> And at the end of the day, I mean, I don't know if you guys actually know people that work
[00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:02.800]   in warehouses, but I know people that work in a Philadelphia warehouse and the South Jersey warehouse.
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:07.840]   And their experiences of anger, frustration, and semi-torture.
[00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:12.560]   >> I love what you're saying, Owen, but apparently, Karsten thinks you look like Denise Howell.
[00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:14.960]   Okay, there we go. >> That's the answer.
[00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:17.760]   >> That's the answer. >> It was freaking my mind out.
[00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:19.440]   >> I mean, you want me to? >> Can you not hear me?
[00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:26.000]   >> Owen's talking. Denise is sitting there. Karsten, I know they both look so much alike, but-
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.520]   >> Hey, I wouldn't want to try and drive that try, Karsten.
[00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:31.600]   >> No, thank you, Denise. Absolutely.
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:34.800]   I know what happened. He's pushing the button.
[00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:43.920]   >> Go ahead, Owen. >> Two people in different states have the same type of horror stories about
[00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:48.640]   the work and environment. So that's, to me, systemic. These two people don't know each other.
[00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:51.920]   They work in two different states. >> And to be fair, the system operates.
[00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:55.520]   They don't quit because that's the best job they can get in that area.
[00:13:55.520 --> 00:14:00.560]   >> Well, they, so here's the thing. There's a puppy mill there. People quit every day,
[00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:03.120]   but at the same time, there's always somebody who needs a job.
[00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:06.720]   >> Well, why don't your friends quit? >> They have quit.
[00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:09.600]   >> Oh, they were talking about their experience when they were there.
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:14.080]   >> Yes, yes, yes. They have quit, and one went back and then quit again.
[00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:17.520]   >> Yeah. >> So, but there, I mean, when I was in high school,
[00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:21.120]   I worked at McDonald's. Not the best job ever cleaning the fry trap.
[00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:25.520]   >> I know. >> But a job, and I was working, and I learned
[00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:32.400]   actually a pretty good work ethic there. I value that work I had, but I guess it wasn't as bad as
[00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:36.800]   working in the name of his own warehouse. >> I worked in warehouses when I was younger,
[00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:39.600]   and I didn't have half the experiences that these people tell me they had.
[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:42.720]   >> Yeah. >> I used to work at that. >> Okay, so it is bad.
[00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:47.440]   >> Yeah. >> It's bad. When you get to a higher up level,
[00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:51.600]   it's like your program to treat everyone below you the same way like they're nothing.
[00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:56.560]   So, the crab box is to try and get up to a level where you get to tell everybody else what to do,
[00:14:56.560 --> 00:15:01.200]   and not have a heart. And then you continue to do it. So, even when you were at the bottom,
[00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:04.800]   and you got treated that way, once you get up to this level, it seems like you're just
[00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:10.560]   predestined to keep the system going with not any understanding. It's a rare machine. Like I
[00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:15.440]   said, capitalism, I get it. You don't have to work there, you can quit. But, I mean, for as big as
[00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:19.520]   they are, and as much money as they make, and as happy they try to make the customer,
[00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:24.080]   they could make their employees a little bit more happy. >> As Dr. Marbius in our chat room says,
[00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:30.480]   soul crushing work teaches you nothing. >> Yeah, and I feel like this isn't a job for high
[00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:33.760]   schoolers just paying their dues. >> No, no, no, they're adults.
[00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:36.640]   >> These are full-time career-oriented adults working on it.
[00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:41.840]   >> Should I not shop at Amazon though? >> You can't not shop at Amazon. Same thing about Walmart.
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:46.960]   >> Yeah, because that's the option. I'll go to jet.com, which is Walmart. Is that better?
[00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:53.360]   Probably not. >> It's all the same. Walmart used to specifically not get people full-time jobs
[00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:57.920]   just so they could keep them subsidized and getting welfare handouts and stuff from the government
[00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:01.440]   until the government's like, we're not going to give you as many subsidies anymore. So, I mean,
[00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:05.760]   again, capitalism at its best. Everybody's got a scam. And if you got to work and you're on the
[00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:11.360]   lower totem pole, you got to do what you got to do. >> Go to your local market, your local bookstore.
[00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:17.680]   Oh, you don't have one anymore? I'm sorry. Go. We do. We're lucky we have an independent bookstore
[00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:21.600]   here. And I feel guilty because I still buy books on Amazon. Occasionally, I will go in there
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:27.600]   and buy books, but the copper feels. But Amazon's so much more convenient. I should probably put my
[00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:31.040]   dollar where my mouse is. >> You should. >> Yeah.
[00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:34.480]   >> You could do it. You could make the effort. You can wait a couple days for a book.
[00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:37.520]   That's the day after order from Amazon. >> I get tomorrow from Amazon.
[00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:41.680]   >> I know. I know. Especially out there, you guys get stuff next day, same day.
[00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:45.280]   Out here, we're still in the two-day hole period. We don't have that instant stuff right here.
[00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:49.760]   >> Oh, man. Almost everything's next day now here. >> God, sometimes it's same day.
[00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:54.560]   >> Sometimes they get that's how they get. Yeah, you're in the LA area. So, they more metro you are,
[00:16:54.560 --> 00:17:00.240]   the more likely you can get it. >> I'm out there. Like I said, I can't lie. It's like, I don't use
[00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:06.240]   Amazon. I do. >> And then in the annals of corporate apologies, there's Telus, which is one of the
[00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:13.200]   two big carriers in Canada. Email has been out since Thursday and Telus.
[00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:17.600]   And I went to the, we got a call on the radio show, I said, "What should I do?" And I said,
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:20.800]   "Well, there's this thing called Gmail." It goes out once in a while, but not for days.
[00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:28.640]   And then I had to play this video. This is Telus.com. This is their apology
[00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:35.440]   from their chief customer officer. >> My name is Tony Garen, chief customer officer at Telus.
[00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:42.160]   To our Telus.net email customers, we've let you down and we are sorry. >> I should point out that
[00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:47.200]   Tony hasn't shaved in about three days. And he's looking a little blurry, to be honest,
[00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:50.720]   that shirt. I don't know. It looks like he hasn't changed that in a couple of days either.
[00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:53.920]   >> He's taking it hard. >> He's taking it hard. >> Arms deep in the routers.
[00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:55.680]   >> He's in there. >> Pulling their cables and pushing them in.
[00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:58.640]   >> They're still managing the water, the plants though, somehow.
[00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:00.880]   >> The plants, well, they're plastic probably, right?
[00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:07.440]   >> That was my female outage. They began on Thursday and prevented many of you from accessing,
[00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:11.280]   sending, or receiving emails from your Telus.net account.
[00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:15.200]   >> He's also hunched over as if the CEO called him and kind of beat him up a little bit.
[00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:18.080]   Doesn't he look a little kind of like gang dog? >> Yeah.
[00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:22.000]   >> I feel so bad for this guy, except... >> You know how vital email is to conduct important
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:27.280]   business, to communicate with family and friends, and to manage schedules and finances.
[00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:33.520]   >> This disruption is unacceptable, and we are doing everything we can to resolve the matter
[00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:37.440]   as soon as possible. >> It's still out. But I have to commend them for saying,
[00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:42.640]   we blew it. I mean, in a truly Canadian fashion, they are actually apologizing.
[00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:43.280]   >> We're sorry. >> Yeah.
[00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:48.160]   >> But on the other hand, they can make a really well produced video
[00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:53.360]   in the time it takes to reboot their servers. And also, that person is not good at reading
[00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:58.960]   off the teleprompter. >> It's not an old job. >> You can literally see the eyes getting in,
[00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:00.720]   like, be authentic. >> Yeah.
[00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:05.760]   >> You can mess up. I'm sorry. >> I would love for one time, like, this is
[00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:11.760]   like 20% better than the Zuckerberg apology. I would love it. For one time, for somebody to just
[00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:19.040]   sit there like, you know, five and slept in three days. >> Dude, we stop.
[00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:24.240]   >> Your emails down, my phone is blowing up, my boss is threatening to sign me.
[00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:28.080]   >> I saw. >> Engineers have put themselves in the hallway,
[00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:32.800]   they're crying in a few positions. We apologize because I don't understand what happened.
[00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:37.040]   It shouldn't happen. We're a multi-billion dollar company. We've messed up for you,
[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:41.120]   and I know it is upsetting. I'm crying inside because I'm proffered. I haven't shaved,
[00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:44.400]   I haven't taken a shower. My dog won't even look at me because I'm so depressed.
[00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:52.000]   >> I am crap. I'm gonna fix it. I want somebody to cry into a camera like that and tell me that
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.200]   they're sorry. So I can be like, you know what? I'm about to double down and give them my money.
[00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:56.640]   I believe that. >> Credit, very.
[00:19:56.640 --> 00:20:00.720]   >> Credit to Tony and tell us, this is the best closest you're ever gonna get a major corporation
[00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:03.760]   to do that. I mean, he looks pretty hang-dog. >> He does.
[00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:09.680]   >> We have a new Oh, Dr. Career. >> That's good.
[00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:14.080]   >> Certainly you're perfect. >> Good. Like they used to hire George Clooney to fire people.
[00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:17.520]   They should hire a doctor to apologize. >> Yeah, Chief of Policy Officer.
[00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:23.120]   >> I'm in negotiations with buying a website from a guy that's called Run It by Us. It's for
[00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:28.000]   companies with no black people or ethnic people or gay people on their board. Whenever they want
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:32.240]   to put something on the internet, they just send me the deck and I mix it up with a whole group of
[00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:37.920]   ethnic people. And they run it by us and for like five grand, we'll tell you if it's racist.
[00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:40.960]   >> This is letting them off the hook. Now they don't have to hire anybody.
[00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:44.880]   >> No, no, they got this. What I'm saying, they don't have to hire anybody. They're not gonna
[00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:48.320]   hire anybody. Anyway, Leo, they come out and do some PR. They bring also put off the
[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:52.400]   streets. They give them a T-shirt. Then six months later, we forget they fire them and give them a
[00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:57.440]   little parachute. I'm saying, with this, run it by us. You know, you can just give them a five
[00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:59.360]   tag. >> It's a good idea. >> And then be clear.
[00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:02.160]   >> Get the Woke take. >> It's a dance.
[00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:06.240]   >> Yeah, it's faux woke. >> No, it's real.
[00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:08.960]   >> Real woke. >> It's just out sourced.
[00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:12.160]   >> Out sourced woke. >> Out sourced woke.
[00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:16.080]   That's it. That's it. >> I think it's a great business idea,
[00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:19.360]   personally. I'm working on it. >> Yeah, I like it. I like it.
[00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:24.160]   Okay, I did two silly stories to begin. Let's take a break.
[00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:28.320]   I know, you know, one of the things that we hear from our audience all the time is
[00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:34.480]   these shows go on so long, they starve to death during the show.
[00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:38.400]   So as a public service announcement, I'd like to introduce you to DoorDash.
[00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:44.960]   This, there's no reason you should be stuck watching a long podcast and not have some pizza
[00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:49.600]   or a Subway sandwich or maybe some lovely cheesecake from the cheesecake factory.
[00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:52.880]   DoorDash puts some of the best restaurants in your town
[00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:58.800]   on your phone so you can order and get the food delivered right to you. All the big
[00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:06.640]   favorite chains like Chipotle and Wendy's and cheesecake factory, the Subway, but also
[00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:15.360]   over 340,000 other amazing restaurants just in your area. DoorDash is now in 3,300 cities,
[00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:21.280]   all 50 states in Canada. When Ant brought his family out here, his teenage son,
[00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:25.440]   Isaiah, we took him out to eat and he looked in on the door. Of course, there's a sticker that says
[00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:31.520]   DoorDash and he said, "Dad, they have DoorDash here too. Yes, they do. They have DoorDash
[00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:36.560]   everywhere. DoorDash is awesome. Get it on your phone. You never know when you're going to be
[00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:41.600]   stuck at the office or starving at school or just a long day of working. You don't want to cook
[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:46.240]   or stuck listening to an extraordinarily long podcast. Treat yourself to the meal you deserve
[00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:52.320]   on demand from your favorite restaurant. Restaurants come to you with DoorDash and I love our Dashes.
[00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:56.240]   Always be nice to your Dasher. They're great people. Right now our listeners can get $5 off
[00:22:56.240 --> 00:23:02.240]   their first order of $15 or more. When you download the DoorDash app, put it on the Android or iOS
[00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:08.560]   and then offer code TWIT. $5 off. Get a little something. Get an extra something.
[00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:12.800]   Some extra chips in guacamole. On your first order, when you download the DoorDash app from
[00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:20.160]   the App Store and enter promo code TWIT, promo code TWIT. I'm tempted. I want to maybe I think
[00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:25.120]   some orders some DoorDash for our studio audience today. They have a lean and hungry look.
[00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:29.600]   I'm so excited. I'm going to have permission to answer the doorbell during the show.
[00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:35.760]   You may go get the door anytime Denise. For any reason at all. Actually you mentioned that
[00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:42.160]   Amazon's crushing UPS but they actually didn't they. The final deal with the FedEx died. There's
[00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:47.280]   no more FedEx ground. FedEx Air was stopped a few months ago because Amazon's just basically
[00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:51.840]   doing it themselves. They bought planes or leased planes in them by planes and they have trucks now
[00:23:51.840 --> 00:24:00.800]   on vans and even people in 1986 El Camino's delivering packages for them. You never know.
[00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:05.920]   It's kind of getting to the point where anybody just throws a sign in the front of their car like
[00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:11.040]   Uber and Lyft. They don't actually. That's the thing. They're unmarked. I think Amazon needs like a
[00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:16.000]   like a chicken delight thing on top of the hood or something that says I'm delivering for Amazon
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.520]   because it's a little weird when somebody pulls up in an unmarked car into your driveway.
[00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:24.880]   Okay. Throws a package at you so that you know the one time you shouldn't answer your doorbell.
[00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:30.400]   Whenever you just won three million dollars in Fortnite. Landshark. Candy Graham.
[00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:35.680]   Because apparently the guy that won three million dollars on Fortnite got swatted.
[00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:45.680]   So this was a story. This guy's 16 year old kid and he did something that made every parent in America
[00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:53.040]   sigh which is he won three million dollars in a Fortnite competition which meant that every
[00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:57.360]   teenage kid has been telling their folks oh no really I can I'm gonna I love I'm gonna make a
[00:24:57.360 --> 00:25:02.880]   living at this profession now they go see see and every parent's gonna oh my god your kid does
[00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:10.640]   your kid play Fortnite yet Denise. Oh he sort of played Fortnite when Fortnite was sweeping globally.
[00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:15.600]   He's already moved on. Oh yeah. I know he was a Minecraft.
[00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:17.920]   I know he was in a Minecraft. What does he what does he do now?
[00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:25.120]   Uh gaming wise oh god you're gonna I can't out him now he'll be embarrassed if I tell you.
[00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:28.320]   Oh let's just say it's summer time and people get outside.
[00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:31.040]   Is it my little pony? Can we pick him in the chat?
[00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:35.200]   There was for a while. I don't know if they're still around the my little bronies.
[00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:38.720]   You knew about them right they were adult men who liked my little pony.
[00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:41.360]   It's a thing it's a thing.
[00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:48.320]   Says no to that. Well Leah doesn't play Fortnite thank the Lord she plays Minecraft and
[00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:51.360]   ruble blocks or whatever. Those are both I think good constructive.
[00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:55.520]   And because you have to think. So besides we're gonna get into this story but the one thing about
[00:25:55.520 --> 00:26:00.400]   that whole the kid wanted through million dollars tennis players don't make that much money to win
[00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:03.120]   a tournament. Golf players don't make that much money. No.
[00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:06.800]   This kid made that much money and the thing about that whole tournament that I didn't really care
[00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:10.320]   if that's your thing and you make money at it god bless you great this is America
[00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:19.440]   but the one kid he got sixth place and he was uncontrollably shaking and crying in his father's
[00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:24.240]   arms because he got sixth place and his dad's just holding him and he's literally just shaking
[00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:28.080]   they're both crying. And guess how much money they made maybe not a hundred thousand dollars.
[00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:28.560]   What?
[00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:30.000]   Throw my daughter on the floor.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   What?
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.320]   You know we just made not a great old crime.
[00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:32.320]   What?
[00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:32.320]   What?
[00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:33.280]   It's a great old crime.
[00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:36.160]   Six plays is great. I'm usually first second.
[00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:37.280]   That's almost a million.
[00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:39.840]   Six plays. I'm like stop.
[00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:41.840]   Daddy we would know we're good son.
[00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:44.480]   Son are the best son any son.
[00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:46.320]   It was.
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:48.240]   Oh I just assumed what she said.
[00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:50.720]   Your tears were involved. It was tears of joy.
[00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:51.680]   No.
[00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:52.000]   No.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:52.560]   They were.
[00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:53.040]   They were.
[00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:55.520]   I wanted the really big trophy daddy.
[00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:56.240]   I wanted the trophy.
[00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:58.000]   Telling the me please daddy.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.600]   I need a hundred thousand dollars.
[00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:00.800]   He was still freaking out.
[00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:01.440]   I'm like.
[00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:01.440]   No.
[00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:01.760]   Kid.
[00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:06.560]   So this poor kid I'm not gonna say his name but according to Kotaku.
[00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:09.520]   He was streaming a Fortnite game Sunday.
[00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:14.880]   People were watching the stream and he abruptly left his desk just like Denise Howell when the
[00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:21.360]   door dash guy comes and his father was coming to tell him that armed police were at the front door.
[00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:24.800]   This is a big problem on twitch and other streaming services where they
[00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:25.440]   SWAT you.
[00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:26.160]   It's terrible.
[00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:28.960]   And as we know swatting is risky.
[00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:29.920]   People can die.
[00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:34.480]   Not to mention the fact that it pulls law enforcement off of real crimes.
[00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:36.560]   And it's expensive.
[00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:40.480]   That was definitely a new one he could be heard saying on the stream.
[00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:41.440]   I got swatted.
[00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:46.080]   I was lucky because the one officer lives in our neighborhood.
[00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:48.080]   We got swatted once at the brick house.
[00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:48.560]   Really?
[00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:51.840]   And fortunately the pedal police are kind of lax.
[00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:56.240]   So a couple of detectives came and said is everything all right?
[00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:57.440]   Yeah.
[00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:00.320]   We're gonna get some dogs just to search just in case.
[00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:02.560]   But you know we figured it was bogus.
[00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:03.520]   Oh man.
[00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:03.760]   So.
[00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:04.800]   Wow.
[00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:05.120]   Yeah.
[00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:06.960]   I shouldn't have said that out loud.
[00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:12.080]   He had appeared on the Tonight Show to talk with Jimmy Fallon about his win.
[00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:16.320]   So he's very public and of course you know this is the problem.
[00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:17.840]   I think gamer culture is a little toxic.
[00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:22.560]   There's a whole section in today's Sunday times about gamergate.
[00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:25.680]   Today is the fifth anniversary of the beginning of gamergate.
[00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:29.440]   Brianna Wu has a piece in it about how it's not getting any better.
[00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:35.920]   They talk about the initial you know the Zoe Quinn who had left.
[00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:37.200]   This is how it all started.
[00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:42.080]   Zoe Quinn had a bad breakup and her 20-something boyfriend wrote a 10,000
[00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:43.760]   word screed against her.
[00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:48.560]   Five years ago a series of vile events changed the way we fight online.
[00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:49.920]   Actually they did this is interesting.
[00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:55.040]   They did a one of their times does these animated editorial online.
[00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:57.360]   But poor Zoe Quinn never went home.
[00:28:57.360 --> 00:28:59.120]   She was visiting friends at San Francisco.
[00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:01.360]   She just she didn't even go back to her home.
[00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:07.040]   And Charlie Wartzell who's been doing some great work I think for the New York Times.
[00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:10.240]   This is technically an opinion piece but it is a history of gamergate.
[00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:14.080]   And it does feel like this community is a little bit toxic.
[00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:18.160]   Well I'll also say okay go ahead.
[00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:18.640]   I'm sorry.
[00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:20.640]   No you go and then I will.
[00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:25.040]   It's not even just the gamer community.
[00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:32.880]   I just got to talk to my daughter about a girl who does a tutorial videos.
[00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:35.280]   And a guy asked her out.
[00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:36.560]   She said no thank you.
[00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:41.040]   And then she ended up getting killed by this person who ended up stalking her,
[00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:43.680]   finding her and killing her via the internet.
[00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:49.600]   So it's so bad when you're out there publicly putting yourself out there.
[00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:53.200]   Like there needs to be something where like if oh doctor was my name maybe you should just
[00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:57.920]   stop giving out real names or something because the more you're online it only takes one crazy
[00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:00.800]   person or one jealous person to destroy your life.
[00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:04.640]   Like you said luckily no one was hurt in this instance but it's not even just video games.
[00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:10.560]   It's just being online and being popular and either desirable in some form or fashion.
[00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:13.600]   It's really creepy right now what's going on with the internet.
[00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:15.120]   We need to figure out a way to fix it.
[00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:15.840]   I don't know how you do it.
[00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:16.160]   Okay great.
[00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:20.320]   It's like I mean there's always been a little bit of this in the world.
[00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:22.560]   They call it prairie dogging.
[00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:27.600]   If you stick your head up, if you become known people tend to want to cut it off.
[00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:31.120]   There's always been a little bit in that world but I think part of the problem is that it's
[00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:39.040]   Twitter especially but eight Chan and four Chan and other Reddit kind of become a big lever,
[00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:44.400]   a big megaphone that can really hype this up much more than just somebody being mean at work.
[00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:47.840]   Oh you want three million dollars huh good for you.
[00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:51.920]   That can really escalate to something much much much worse.
[00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:57.040]   And so I kind of blame social media but on the other hand what are you going to do?
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:31:02.240]   I mean you can't can Facebook, Twitter, control it.
[00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:07.920]   Eight Chan is pretty much shut down but that didn't mean that zero eight Chan wasn't started
[00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:11.360]   and take it up right immediately the same way.
[00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:13.360]   It's kind of the nature of the world we live in.
[00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:19.600]   So what I was thinking is certainly the behavior is something that can't be tolerated and
[00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:25.440]   as our doctor was saying needs needs to be addressed one way or another and it's a hard
[00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:32.720]   nut to crack but from a tech policy and privacy standpoint another thing we probably could come
[00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:38.000]   at is the fact that traditionally property ownership records are public.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:42.160]   That's the problem. Yeah you oh doctor can be oh doctor but how long before he's docked?
[00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:47.440]   Well I live on a black site no one could actually find my address but that's just me.
[00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:52.000]   If you buy a house you're right Denise if you buy a house the problem was in the old days it
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:56.400]   went to the county seat and it was on a piece of paper at the county county seat
[00:31:56.400 --> 00:32:00.880]   but then there's companies like Spokio that send people out to every county seat and record all
[00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:05.680]   this stuff and put it online. Do you change the laws Denise?
[00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:10.880]   Maybe I mean maybe it's time to start thinking about you know I know people have been appalled
[00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:17.120]   for years at what can be found out about them just through simple web searching and one of the
[00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:22.960]   primary things that can be found out is if you own property and your name is on the deed as it
[00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:29.760]   tends to be or some you know entity that you're involved in is on the deed then you can easily
[00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:36.160]   be linked to that. Let me ask you because Denise is a professional lawyer. I'm asking for a friend
[00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:41.520]   is it possible to buy a home without your name being on the record like is it possible to buy
[00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:48.240]   under a holding company or something that can't be traced back to you? Sure you can have a corporation
[00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:52.720]   own property but then people go look up the corporate records. Right right right yeah I mean
[00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:59.680]   if you're determined enough to do what did Johnny Depp do? I don't know what did Johnny Depp?
[00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:04.000]   I don't know I just figured if you're a money star you're not going to buy a house in the name
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:10.640]   Johnny Depp right? Do you have your agent your manager buy it? Right I think you know and isn't
[00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:18.320]   that sad that we're talking about what do ordinary people living their lives who are not Johnny Depp
[00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:24.640]   that's the problem that Brianna Wu and Zoe Quinn don't have the resources that a movie star does
[00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:30.240]   to hide their traces so they're easily doxible. The thing that drives me crazy what you're just
[00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:36.160]   talking about finding online it's not even so easy to find out someone's address online but there's
[00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:41.760]   all these websites that for a $34 don't do a background check but the last stuff for you like
[00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:46.400]   that's something we should cut down on because if you had to actually do the work yourself people
[00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:50.160]   probably give up on it but if they're looking at a site and they're like oh for $5.99 I can get
[00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:58.240]   your phone number your address and relatives okay sure I'll go pay for that like it's really I don't
[00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:03.840]   know it's really weird really weird I do I do want to point out that comes back to what's going to be
[00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:07.840]   public information because that's just somebody willing to do the work for you and then you pay
[00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:16.080]   them for it right so if the information is available someone's going to go find it yeah I should point
[00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:22.240]   out that Congress is asking as subpoena the owner of 8chan Jim Watkins he'll be appearing before
[00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:28.720]   Congress on September 5th he himself says I really don't like what's happened and he shut it down he
[00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:32.960]   said I wish I never started it but he also pointed out and quite rightly as soon as I shut down what
[00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:39.680]   she did somebody else would come along and there is in fact zero 8chan which is the same thing so
[00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:44.800]   it's pretty hard I mean you cannot the nature of the internet is anybody can create an account
[00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:49.360]   even a Twitter starts to shut down the on nazis they just created a new account it doesn't
[00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:56.800]   okay so I'll try to give a hopeful framing please please man please man which is it feels like
[00:34:56.800 --> 00:35:02.480]   companies were not thinking about all of the sort of digital smog that they were creating and
[00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:07.840]   the externalities and the and the byproducts and the sludge and all of the your Google early on
[00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:13.440]   yeah and we're those conversations like part there was a there was a story I think maybe Carlin
[00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:17.920]   McCarthy wrote it about Google plus and how they were just trying to copy Facebook I loved that
[00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:23.680]   story yeah and how they missed out on they could have created something different better where the
[00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:27.360]   interactions would be healthier and you wouldn't have as much of them well and because Google plus
[00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:33.200]   had the tools necessary yeah users could block people from commenting they could write they're
[00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:38.000]   you had actually it was so much better than Twitter yeah Mike Ogun would always Mike and I and others
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:43.440]   have said for years we were we were extremely disappointed that Google didn't keep Google plus
[00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:47.760]   going it I know they still use it internally well and I don't think it's the end of the world
[00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:54.480]   for Google plus to go away but if what happens out of the last year or two is new companies realize
[00:35:54.480 --> 00:36:00.160]   that they need to think about the holistic aspect of their their footprint and the implications of
[00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:04.240]   how people interact with each other online yeah maybe the pendulum is starting to swing the other
[00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:09.920]   way where we you know we start to see safer spaces or smaller spaces or more fragmented spaces where
[00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:15.760]   you don't have some of the same you know negative side effects that we currently have on social media
[00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:20.400]   so before before we switch topics going in there exactly what you were just saying
[00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:27.120]   does anybody have the new Instagram where they don't show likes yet no nope okay so Instagram
[00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:30.800]   you know instagram's doing a thing where they're trying different countries and they're not showing
[00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:36.480]   likes anymore so people don't have anxiety and stress and they're cutting down on the dopamine
[00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:41.600]   and your addiction and need to have likes and all those kind of stuff and they say they want it to be
[00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:46.640]   for health mental health and anxiety and stress and they're trying to cut down on it which
[00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:53.040]   I personally don't believe at all I feel like that's like a sham because it's owned by Facebook so
[00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:59.120]   it sounds great but I don't like it at all I don't I don't like that idea I don't like that premise
[00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:03.600]   I don't like that thing I haven't seen it yet but what you were just talking about is a company
[00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:09.280]   quote-unquote saying that they're trying to make it better for people's mental health and mindset and
[00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:14.400]   not wanting to one up each other I think it's about the fact that they're losing out on
[00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:23.600]   branding marketing and advertising dollars because if I am a person with a million followers
[00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:29.600]   and I get 200,000 likes the brand could come directly to me instead of running trash Instagram as
[00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:35.520]   through the feed they can get something organic through me but if they can't get the likes and I
[00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:39.440]   can't prove that I'm worth the value that they're paying me so then they might just go back to
[00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:42.720]   Instagram and say okay we're gonna run whatever kind of ads you want us to run so
[00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:48.800]   I also think that that face what are the things Facebook does and Instagram is a Facebook company
[00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:54.560]   in fact they're gonna rename it Instagram by Facebook for reasons I don't fully understand
[00:37:54.560 --> 00:38:02.400]   what are the things Facebook does is the minimum to deflect like oh well hey we're getting rid of
[00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:08.000]   likes as if that would have anything to do with influencers and I mean maybe you're right maybe
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:11.920]   it's an economic thing oh doctor but I also think that's just like well we're doing something
[00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:16.560]   Twitter does that too yeah we're doing something it's the least they're do the least they can do
[00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:22.880]   and it doesn't seem to make any difference at all I mean how does getting rid of the likes to
[00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:29.120]   anything to reduce the value of influencers you still get rid of the follower count maybe
[00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:35.120]   get rid of the follower count are they thinking about that I don't think so no because then if
[00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:38.560]   ever if you don't know how many followers somebody has you don't know if they're an influencer
[00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:44.000]   right they could just be a regular person they could be somebody normal yeah what's up with
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   closes like this I don't know that that would have helped this fortnight kid though right no I feel
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:57.520]   bad for the kid but you know when I'm in three million dollars welcome to the world this is not
[00:38:57.520 --> 00:39:04.240]   going to go well do you know a single lottery winner who's happy on on the gaming aspect of this
[00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:09.760]   story do you guys know that you see Irvine which is our local you see here in Orange County has a
[00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:17.680]   full-on esports arena that they have what and with with with taxpayers money no less yes they've got
[00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:22.800]   one here on East Coast of Philadelphia it's three point four million dollars on the taxpayers dime
[00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:26.720]   they've built one out here too it'll be opening next year there's a whole thing I'm sure they got
[00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:33.440]   donations yes secondary signature like Fresno Texas or somewhere like there's a whole bunch of places
[00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:38.240]   looking to use esports as a way to revitalize their cities but I don't understand a university
[00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:47.360]   doing it here's the it's here's the site it's esports.uci.edu and it's a very nice fancy site they do say
[00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:54.160]   it's powered by iBuyPower which so they have they have a name they have sponsorship they have a name
[00:39:54.160 --> 00:40:01.600]   competition okay all of all every sports arena in America has a every sports arena in America
[00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:09.600]   has a name on it smoothie center whatever they mean right the city center pays for the state more
[00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:14.640]   power to UCI as far as I'm concerned they are not exactly a sports powerhouse so if this can be
[00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:21.920]   their stock right but then they show like they say academics and they show a guy working on brains
[00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:28.240]   I don't think that's in the esports thing I don't know I mean they just kind of threw that one in
[00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:34.320]   apparently you can get a degree in esports from UCI okay does anybody else remember the far side
[00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:42.080]   cartoon from 1990 where Gary Larson was like in the year 2005 like people will make a hundred
[00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:47.120]   thousand dollars playing Mario Brothers you got it you pulled it up and it's like Nintendo expert
[00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:54.320]   needed fifty thousand dollars salary plus car you know fast forward 20 years UCI esports to offer
[00:40:54.320 --> 00:41:04.320]   scholarships for top super smash brothers ultimate players I mean you know mom look I got a scholarship
[00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:11.760]   oh that's exciting the Nintendo World Championship esports event is coming up on CBS August 25th
[00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:18.080]   what is it like we're doing a good public service announcement for the offspring of our listeners
[00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:24.800]   here well and apparently esports brings in like I mean if you okay so the what is it Patriot Act
[00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:29.120]   is the Netflix show he talked about video game industry and he was saying the video games now
[00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:38.880]   bring in more than like the NBA NHL like all movies all put together so so I I recently had a job
[00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:43.120]   interview my first job interview in 10 years a recruiter reached out to me to do social media
[00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:47.520]   for the Sixers I don't know if I got the job I probably won't some crazy but when I went there
[00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:53.840]   to go meet them I met three guys that work four of the Sixers as the Sixers sports team to play
[00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:59.920]   2k as the Sixers they travel around and do tournaments across the country and these three dudes are like
[00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:06.160]   two times bigger than me and like when I said like you wouldn't it doesn't matter but they're decked
[00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:12.000]   out and like $300 Jordan's like these guys are bawling out of control making money like I was
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:17.280]   like yeah how much money do you make he's like oh we make anywhere between 250 to 500 thousand a year
[00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:21.920]   but then we do our own tournaments where we can make double that and I'm like they're paying you
[00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:28.320]   to play basketball and pretend to be the stars that they actually have on the court I wasted so
[00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:35.360]   much of my you got to tell your daughter you got to tell your daughter that there will be $6,000
[00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:43.440]   scholarships you have to try out for the there's apparently you see Irvine wants to have a super
[00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:50.160]   smash brothers team the smash community at UCI is one of the biggest most passionate gaming clubs
[00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:55.520]   on campus they already offer scholarships to League of Legends and Overwatch players
[00:42:55.520 --> 00:43:01.040]   so they got a donor from LA Weekly the CEO of LA Weekly is apparently a big gamer
[00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:06.800]   there's no coach for the team UCI's e-sports will provide staff to coordinate practice times travel
[00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:12.400]   social media equipment needs that's the job I need to get I want to be their coach I want to be the
[00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:17.520]   trainer I want to be I want to the guy got runs out gives him a squirt with a water bottle in between
[00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:21.600]   sessions I just got to hype him up like you do a great man you do a great man you tape him up give
[00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:26.640]   me a shot of something a little bit you know right in the after the game the wrist how the wrist feeling
[00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:34.080]   Johnny right players expect to practice oh get ready for this you're expected to practice 10 to 15
[00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:41.360]   hours a week and maintain a 2.0 GPA not a oh my god you're gonna say 10 to 15 hours a day and I was
[00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:47.200]   gonna say yeah that's more like it more like it you mean I can only play 15 hours a week coach put me in
[00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:53.360]   but that 2.0 GPA that could be I feel like we're living in you know what I am an old man now
[00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:59.200]   I am an old man now I understand why all my elders when I was a kid were saying you're a kid
[00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:05.360]   and you're a rachen roll I don't get it I don't get the world we've created what is this this makes
[00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:12.960]   nose I think and by the way what is it 2.0 GPA yeah that's you is that a D average what is that please
[00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:21.040]   have a pulse see average please have a pulse and be 15 hours of Mario on the other hand I would
[00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:27.360]   I would rather watch a good speed run of portal to then like all right that's true I mean you know
[00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:32.560]   that's more interesting I'm sending this to our son he's actually pretty good it's super smash
[00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:39.280]   brothers there you go yeah I mean if you sit back and think about our traditional hugely
[00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:46.880]   commercially successful world of sports is there anything more ridiculous about super Mario than
[00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:52.560]   football it's less dangerous that's true let's watch let's watch the recruitment video are you
[00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:59.920]   ready here we go turn up the sound do you think you have what it takes to join UCI esports are you
[00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:05.760]   not you're not hearing me are you not feeling me man our program focuses on five pillars let me
[00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:12.000]   start over again I guess to love the high fives esports esports hi my name is mark deputy and
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   I'm the director of the UCI esports program and I want to talk a little bit about what I think he
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:22.560]   tells his mother he does for a living I coach sports on the other hand my mom doesn't really
[00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:29.120]   know what I do for a that's true you know network ports fixing together that's true pretty
[00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:34.800]   our program focuses on five pillars competition academics and research community research and
[00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:44.800]   careers I have researched what the best kill shot is for the plumber and I believe I will
[00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:50.720]   rate a thesis competition it's kind of a sizzle that ties the whole program together we want our
[00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:56.960]   teams to compete against the best college time I'm gonna take trash talk to a one uh world when
[00:45:56.960 --> 00:46:01.120]   we were connected we're looking for many things we're looking for strong students that have a
[00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:06.560]   great academic background and can demonstrate that they have you get a 2.0 man you're in successful
[00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:11.200]   at UC Irvine we're looking for talk okay I shouldn't I shouldn't make fun of this you know what I hear
[00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:17.840]   what I hear is we should have this week in video game esports because apparently lots of sponsors
[00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:21.920]   I think we already uh very pitching that
[00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:28.560]   and I'm not willing to write off their ability to do meaningful research gamification is a thing
[00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:35.600]   okay good point yeah just what we need more people with PhDs in gamification yeah let's make
[00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:40.320]   more of the internet addictive but for good but for good addictive for good
[00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:47.680]   is the VA website gonna have gamification uh are you working on that first uh it's good to have
[00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:52.000]   the VA site where everybody can use it on a mobile phone and everybody's happy with it you don't
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:56.560]   have to fill a paper form responsive design was an early goal that's an early goal maybe maybe later
[00:46:56.560 --> 00:47:03.200]   gamification Wow did you see I yeah really you'll know where to get those graduates
[00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:08.400]   is that now I'm curious because what do they say about employment prospects do they I guess it's
[00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:13.680]   I mean are you gonna uh you're right it's just like sports recruiting right it's the same thing
[00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:17.200]   yeah and if it's bigger than the NBA
[00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:24.560]   maybe you should do it what a world right because there are pro leagues these people will go on to
[00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:33.760]   presumably for all of us that are not six feet tall yeah a little tubby little tubby uh you know
[00:47:33.760 --> 00:47:41.840]   really good at sitting down that's me I got a giant thumb it's good good carpal tunnel action
[00:47:41.840 --> 00:47:47.520]   with conflection fast so yahoo bought tumblr
[00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:54.720]   Marissa Meyer really trying to beef up the yahoo brand for 1.1 billion dollars
[00:47:54.720 --> 00:48:04.000]   1.1 billion dollars uh yahoo was eventually sold to Verizon for what was it it was a lot three
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:09.280]   billion something like that uh that's a good it was pretty good I think i think marissa got out
[00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:13.920]   unscathed but Verizon couldn't figure out what the hell do i do with tumblr
[00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:20.640]   so they first of all they realized oh it's a porn site we just bought a porn site one third of all
[00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:28.320]   of the tumble logs tumblr log blogs were uh were adult content so they banned that lost one
[00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:36.080]   third of their audience now most more than one third of their audience really you think I I
[00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:42.080]   discussed this like a long time ago we're on here I used to use tumblr as a funnel for web traffic
[00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:46.080]   simply because of that like you could i'm not going to go into details and stuff that I would do
[00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:50.000]   but you could mix and match content and you could drive people to click on anything you wanted
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:55.760]   them to click on via tumblr once they shut tumblr down and tried to make a quote unquote kid friendly
[00:48:55.760 --> 00:49:01.680]   not only did they take off the adult content they took off a lot of the content just adult meme
[00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:08.160]   content some things that weren't even sexual like porn but they just deemed inappropriate
[00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:13.520]   so they cut off massive amounts of free flowing content they used to flow through tumble my
[00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:20.560]   daughter's website is actually i love tumblr i you know mark carmen and david carp created something
[00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:26.400]   great they were they got a good exit they sold a yahoo for in 2013 for 1.1 billion it's an instagram
[00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:30.800]   and even before they took the stuff off like she never saw anything battle because they had the
[00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:34.480]   filter you follow what you follow and that's you don't see anything not even like that you just
[00:49:34.480 --> 00:49:39.200]   had a filter that said no it doesn't see adult content or not and people would usually respectfully
[00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:43.280]   mark their stuff and you know you never see anything but once they took that off it just you know it's
[00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:48.720]   downhill yahoo wrote down the site's value by two hundred thirty million dollars three years later
[00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:58.160]   sold to verizon 1.8 revenue within the verizon media group now formally oath okay there was
[00:49:58.160 --> 00:50:02.080]   another bad thing verizon decided to name the whole thing oath for reasons no one understands
[00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:07.200]   was 1.8 billion in the second quarter so that's not bad but finally verizon said look we got to get
[00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:12.720]   they got to unload this tumblr thing so they sold it and we've been talking about toxicity on
[00:50:12.720 --> 00:50:18.640]   twitter but lest we forget but for twitter we couldn't get hot takes like deter bonds where he
[00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:24.080]   tweeted tumblr sold for the cost of two bedrooms san francisco home in noe valley that's right
[00:50:25.120 --> 00:50:30.000]   we don't know the exact figure but the the washing wall street journal saying two million dollars
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:35.760]   for this formerly valued at one billion dollar company yeah we could have bought that thing
[00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:42.720]   turn porn back on flipped it for another billion i would yeah i mean yeah that's literally all you
[00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:47.760]   had to do uncle leo if i had none i would have we that they wanted more than that to buy the
[00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:54.960]   break house so wordpress uh com's parent company automatic bought it and which actually is great
[00:50:54.960 --> 00:51:00.880]   uh matt maulin wag says we're not turning the porn back on but work i think it actually makes
[00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:05.760]   sense wordpress has a platform that's probably a little more beefy for people who need more
[00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:11.440]   capability tumblr anybody could quickly and easily set up a blog i loved having a tumblr
[00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:17.520]   um so i had quit my tumblr account a long time ago uh not because of the adult stuff but just

[00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:40.160]   always want to sell at the peak mmm hmm that's right all right let's take a break and then we're
[00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:46.640]   going to come back there's some apple news i'm studiously avoiding the wired story three years
[00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:53.360]   of misery inside google it hurts it's a little too close to home but matt cuts red i'll ask you
[00:52:53.360 --> 00:53:01.280]   what you think and we have a googler in the audience who doesn't look evil at all so there right
[00:53:01.280 --> 00:53:06.640]   actually i thought the article was very positive about google because it really what it really
[00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:12.080]   said is that employees at google unlike say employees at the emissant filaments that are have a voice
[00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:17.760]   and can stand up and can walk out and can say no we don't want to do this we don't want it to be
[00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:23.440]   this way uh in fact they there's a quote that's well we'll get to it in a second i i'll talk about
[00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:29.040]   just a bit our show today brought to you by my mattress everybody has a casper right
[00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:33.760]   you don't all right let me tell you about casper you ought to get a casper it's the best mattress out
[00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:41.120]   there casper uh was started by some guys who said you know there this is actually the best stuff in
[00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:45.920]   silicon valley comes out of this kind of notion that there are places in the economy that are
[00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:51.200]   inefficient where you're spending more than you ought to and a mattress is man they were the worst
[00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:57.280]   because basically a mattress company would make a mattress and then sell it to a mattress showroom
[00:53:57.280 --> 00:54:01.840]   would mark it would double the cost mattress showroom takes half so that means you're paying twice as
[00:54:01.840 --> 00:54:07.040]   much as you need to for the mattress and what do you get from a mattress showroom the privilege
[00:54:07.040 --> 00:54:12.800]   of lying on the mattress for a minute in broad daylight with a salesperson staring at you you
[00:54:12.800 --> 00:54:17.520]   can't even take off your shoes i mean it's ridiculous it's not a good way to test a mattress but that's
[00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:21.760]   a problem because people want to do that so casper said well we could get rid of the middleman we could
[00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:28.000]   sell really beautiful premium mattresses for a fraction of what they cost in the store but people
[00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:32.000]   do want to lie on it right so what we're going to do and this was brilliant now everybody's doing it
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:37.520]   they started this we're going to give people a hundred nights if you don't like it after a
[00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:43.600]   hundred nights you buy your casper free delivery painless returns in the us in canada a one hundred
[00:54:43.600 --> 00:54:47.760]   night risk free sleep on a trial so if you don't like it after a hundred nights they'll come and
[00:54:47.760 --> 00:54:52.560]   get it here's my casper i just got the new one i love this casper just introduced their hybrid
[00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:57.760]   mattress collection now i've had a casper forever and i love the casper but the hybrid
[00:54:57.760 --> 00:55:03.200]   mattress does something interesting they brought back springs so they've always had this award-winning
[00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:08.320]   durable foam mattresses but now they've added durable yet gentle springs in the mattress
[00:55:08.320 --> 00:55:13.520]   this new innovation gives you luxurious comfort resilient support elevated lift
[00:55:13.520 --> 00:55:19.600]   for active support all body types i'm a little heavier than my wife but the springs really help
[00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:24.880]   look how comfy that looks oh it's so nice increased airflow within the spring network so you sleep
[00:55:24.880 --> 00:55:29.440]   even cooler that's one of the best things about casper mattresses we know sleeping cool is an important
[00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:37.120]   part of sleeping well and then this is for me because when i get up at a bed i would roll off the
[00:55:37.120 --> 00:55:42.880]   mattress because the edge wouldn't you know be firm it beats the same softness now with the
[00:55:42.880 --> 00:55:47.760]   springs you have enhanced edge support firmer perimeters that makes it easier to get in and out
[00:55:47.760 --> 00:55:55.440]   of bed this new casper mattress is awesome i just got it as you saw i tried it out as always though i
[00:55:55.440 --> 00:55:59.520]   don't know how they do this even though they've got springs in it it still comes in the surprisingly
[00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:05.840]   compact box which makes it very easy don't do what i did i opened the mattress in the foyer big mistake
[00:56:05.840 --> 00:56:11.760]   because then i had to man handling it into the bedroom bring it into the bedroom and open it
[00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:17.360]   i just a little tip something i've learned but i have to say when i when my son went to college we
[00:56:17.360 --> 00:56:22.080]   got him a casper he was able to get up three flights in the dorm get a nice comfy mattress and it was
[00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:27.440]   so affordable that when he was ready to leave after four years he said should i take it with me i said
[00:56:27.440 --> 00:56:33.280]   no leave it will get you a new one let the next kid enjoy your casper mattress i love it even with
[00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:38.960]   the springs the casper's are the hybrid mattresses are amazingly compact they arrive in your doorstep
[00:56:38.960 --> 00:56:45.520]   you open the box you've got a great night's sleep and by the way no airing out no i've i've had
[00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:50.240]   mattresses fancy expensive mattresses from big brands where you really didn't want to sleep on it

[00:57:35.200 --> 00:57:40.960]   we are probably in all likelihood only a couple of weeks off from the new iphone the note 10 comes
[00:57:40.960 --> 00:57:48.080]   i get my note 10 thursday the new iphone fast company thinks september 10th that makes a lot of
[00:57:48.080 --> 00:57:55.200]   sense uh that's the second tuesday in september that seems like a reasonable time rumor mill has
[00:57:55.200 --> 00:58:00.480]   been going crazy not only with this year's iphone they're already starting to talk about the 2020
[00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:04.960]   iphone which is really nuts because that's the one that's going to make a difference this one's
[00:58:04.960 --> 00:58:10.480]   going to be the same iphone as the last iphone probably or better sexier same same more cameras
[00:58:10.480 --> 00:58:16.560]   better camera isn't that all that really matters in a modern smartphone is how good the camera is
[00:58:16.560 --> 00:58:20.080]   battery life if it did then the pics will be the number one phone in the world because that's the
[00:58:20.080 --> 00:58:28.480]   camera that really matters i think he's a red i found a friend i think he's right i just i so i
[00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:32.560]   i get review units i don't make videos so because i'm just lazy so i just usually do like behind
[00:58:32.560 --> 00:58:37.280]   the scenes reviews i gave that phone to four different people and they loved it the pixel
[00:58:37.280 --> 00:58:45.680]   xl3a is just superior what that phone does as far as for tagracy with one lens with one lens and so
[00:58:45.680 --> 00:58:49.520]   at the end of the day if they have better marketing or if they just say you know what forget this we're
[00:58:49.520 --> 00:58:54.240]   gonna sell this to you and charge you triple the rate that camera is the best camera on a phone
[00:58:54.240 --> 00:59:01.600]   okay period but i'm gonna say something controversial oh here we go the hardware is crappy i love the
[00:59:01.600 --> 00:59:09.280]   camera but it the it's it kills background processes like that right they still haven't fixed that
[00:59:09.280 --> 00:59:16.720]   the hardware is not the greatest hardware on camera on the camera nice and it has dedicated
[00:59:16.720 --> 00:59:21.840]   camera chip which the a does not no i'll grant you that but i have to say there is something to be
[00:59:21.840 --> 00:59:28.160]   said then this is the s10 the note will have it with multiple lenses so with one lens you get one
[00:59:28.160 --> 00:59:36.800]   focal length this one i have telephoto you know zoom in normal and why it's super wide i can get
[00:59:36.800 --> 00:59:42.080]   this whole studio in and that's the lens it's optical and i have to say i agree with you doctor
[00:59:42.080 --> 00:59:46.560]   that the software then the pixel three is second and none the engine that they put in there the
[00:59:46.560 --> 00:59:51.760]   extra hardware that the chip that makes a big difference and but i think that even in the galaxy
[00:59:51.760 --> 00:59:59.520]   s10 plus the night site which they just put out in their july update is uh i think it's as good as
[00:59:59.520 --> 01:00:04.880]   i think it's as good as google's uh it's not it's not you could say that but it's not aesthetically
[01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:10.080]   sam's song makes the best looking phones period their phones aesthetically look sexy
[01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:16.080]   beautiful phone peeling you know how much ram is in this phone 12 gigabytes you know how much
[01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:21.440]   storage is in this phone a terra bike not making up stuff that i don't care about
[01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:25.120]   pixel three their only problem was that horrible knots that they made it they would have made
[01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:29.840]   a sexy phone you would all had that so the four coming up and i'm gonna do why do you get
[01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:36.720]   no not no not in the four just a big just a big chin you can you can tell me oh you got a forehead i'm
[01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:42.080]   sorry just a big forehead i'm gonna i'm gonna tell you don't lie about that camera in that phone because
[01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:47.760]   it's not about the size of the boat it's about the motion and the ocean so you can say what you
[01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:53.280]   want to i'm telling you the pixel has the camera there's a good camera there's a real three oh doctor
[01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:59.840]   one i'm just saying it's not good i'm just saying it's not the best then he's we can escape with a
[01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:06.880]   zero score we we just have to it's not too late to be politically incorrect mmm all right i just
[01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:12.560]   even know that the next iphone was coming out so soon until we started prepping it's a little weird
[01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:17.360]   when you think about that but of course every system yeah are they but i i'm wondering if any
[01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:25.360]   of you know whether apple is paying attention to any of the facial recognition issues biometric
[01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:32.000]   privacy issues you know they did they did some pretty uh revolutionary hardware stuff with um
[01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:37.840]   the ten so i'm wondering if you've seen any coverage of that with the eleven
[01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:44.000]   there there may focus is selling units they're not selling units like they're supposed to right
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:49.200]   now but they're selling services they're making more money per user so oh yeah they will they
[01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:53.120]   especially that credit card popping off that's going to be i love john groover who's normally an
[01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:58.400]   apple shill right really loves the apple he loves the apple i wouldn't call him a shill okay he loves
[01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:03.120]   the apple there's a fine line he loves him a good apple loving a good apple
[01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:08.320]   loving him really good at being a shill but okay i'll grant you i think it's authentic he's authentic
[01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:13.040]   he says the billboards apple billboard should have said what happens on your iphone stays in your
[01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:19.040]   iphone except for some of your syria recordings which we listen to uh he was uh actually a little
[01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:27.360]   bit harsh this week on apple syria privacy and trust he says uh you know google he even praises
[01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:34.560]   google who would have thought he praises google because google says uh yeah we record uh your
[01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:40.960]   voice when you use google uh assistant and we save it and you can even go here and listen to
[01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:49.760]   your recordings and yes humans will listen to it uh and uh but you could turn that off and you can
[01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:55.440]   delete him he says that's what google did apple doesn't even do that apple should
[01:02:56.560 --> 01:03:01.360]   he says the until the opt-in process is crystal clear apple should delete all existing recordings
[01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:08.320]   and confirm it's no longer saving them they were keeping copies with identifying information for
[01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:14.560]   six months until the guardian published their story last week he says this defies everyone's
[01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:19.840]   expectations for privacy for a voice assistant and he says especially for apple and that's the key
[01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:23.680]   apple is it reasonable to hold apple to a higher standard because they're they're they
[01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:30.720]   champion privacy he says apple literally advertises on the basis of its user focused privacy policies
[01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:36.400]   and they tell them how much they're going to hear from some eu regulators yeah
[01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:45.440]   he says uh on the uh assistant on on um let me see let me find find this here on uh um
[01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:54.480]   ios let me find this here it is comparing contrast with ios's transcript feature for
[01:03:54.480 --> 01:04:00.640]   voicemail okay so this is the voicemail transcriptions at the very bottom of every transcription on ios
[01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:06.400]   the ios asked whether transcription was useful or not useful if you tap either of those you get a
[01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:12.000]   very explicit prompt help improve trans uh transcription's question mark would you like to submit this
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:17.120]   voicemail to apple to improve accuracy recordings will only be used to improve the quality of speech
[01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:21.760]   recognition and apple products and here's a sentence he really likes do not submit recordings
[01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:25.680]   if you believe the speaker would be uncomfortable with you submitting the content to apple
[01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:30.080]   that's good that's the way it should be that's not what they do with syri
[01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:35.840]   especially when apple goes out of their way to tell you that they're coming up with ways to give
[01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:41.280]   out fake emails to keep privacy from third party and app developers like that but they're out there
[01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:45.680]   doing whatever they want to do they're they so championed that other companies are trying to
[01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:49.840]   steal your information and we're going to protect you from that but then they can go do what they
[01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:58.160]   want to do and not be responsible which is america okay but now i'm going to praise apple for a second
[01:04:58.160 --> 01:05:03.680]   which feels really weird i'm like in a no i love it i'm like love it what is this muscle okay but
[01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:09.840]   you know if if in good faith somebody made a mistake and there's room to improve and they
[01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:16.160]   apologize and do improve it like we've seen people make mistakes fix it and actually get more goodwill
[01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:20.800]   win from being like oh you know what we did want to put that as a core or a pillar and we didn't do
[01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:24.960]   as well as we could right this represents a really interesting opportunity it is at the point where
[01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:30.320]   you lose daring fireball like yeah there's probably alarm bells going off within parts of apple
[01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:32.560]   that's at that point you hire o doctor
[01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:36.560]   run it run it bias
[01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:42.720]   should we just call it o doctor apologizes dot com no that won't work you got to have

[01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:05.200]   oh doctor's ass dot com i think it's going to be great
[01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:13.040]   you're for one one uh foreign one huh okay oh man get the domain
[01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:25.600]   uh apple is suing a company named corollium because their corollium is doing ios in virtualization
[01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:30.720]   corollium is a mobile device virtualization company that supports ios they say they're the first and
[01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:37.520]   only platform that uh offers ios android and linux virtualization on arm apple says you can't
[01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:44.240]   virtualize our stuff because that means you're using our code
[01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:50.480]   corollium's business apples suit says is based entirely in commercializing the illegal replication
[01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:54.400]   of the copyrighted operating system and applications that run on apple's iphone ipad and other apple
[01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:59.040]   devices it's a virtual version we've seen these we've seen this before right tennice
[01:06:59.040 --> 01:07:03.440]   right there was a company that was doing windows virtualization that microsoft shut down
[01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:10.320]   yeah and i think apple probably wouldn't have much trouble getting it shut down the sort of
[01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:18.080]   side-effective that if they were to get case law on it i immediately thought of um game
[01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:26.560]   emulations that people are doing to try and keep old games live that um are no longer supported by
[01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:37.040]   their developers but still have avid players um there's a museum in oakland called the made i
[01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:46.000]   forget what that stands for um museum something digital art uh anyway uh it's it's uh that's one
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:52.960]   of its projects is helping keep old games alive so um i think that apple will you know probably squash
[01:07:52.960 --> 01:08:00.480]   this but if it does you know does it also squash sort of uh from a legal presidential standpoint
[01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:07.520]   uh the ability to do what the made is doing and that's really interesting yeah or the internet
[01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:12.720]   archive so i was just gonna say in that archive is keeping a lot of these classic games alive for
[01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:22.160]   very very good reason they um uh there aren't there there i mean it's as if uh we printed books
[01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:26.880]   but one but you had to have a special reader to read the books and once the reader was at a
[01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:32.080]   business uh you could never read the book again yeah and and i think it's really important to remember
[01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:38.480]   that these are these are more than just you know commerce these are more than just capitalism
[01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:43.600]   these are works of art just like movies are works of art and you got to preserve them there's gotta
[01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:49.840]   be now somehow the internet archive gets away with this um there's gotta be well yeah there are
[01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:57.520]   exceptions for for things like search search does copying right and and courts have uh you know very
[01:08:57.520 --> 01:09:02.160]   early on carved out an exception while this is something in the public interest and uh we're
[01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:07.840]   gonna let that kind of copying happen because we need search or else the internet is is nothing
[01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:16.160]   um so hopefully there would be room for that kind of development too um but you know it's sort of
[01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:21.680]   once something like this becomes law on the books then it's something that has to be overcome by
[01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:28.400]   someone like the internet archive or made and hopefully um won't give them too many headaches
[01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:33.600]   i wish i could uh i bookmark this and i don't remember where i bookmark it but there i just found a
[01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:40.480]   site that keeps alive the old uh user interfaces for apple and microsoft and stuff like that i think
[01:09:40.480 --> 01:09:46.880]   it's might be part of the internet archives but that's another example where that's part of culture
[01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:52.240]   and i guess technically you could say it's copyright violation i i would hope that internet
[01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:57.200]   archives protected i remember asking buster kale have founded it and he said we just don't think
[01:09:57.200 --> 01:10:02.000]   we don't bother we just copy everything and not worry about it but nobody everybody i think
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:07.760]   everybody recognizes there's a value uh to it there it is the vintage operating system archive
[01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:13.680]   is it is it also the fact that it's not trying to profit from it yes i think that's part of it
[01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:17.680]   you bet right Denise does that let you off the hook if you're not commercial it doesn't let
[01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:22.480]   you off the hook unfortunately but it does factor in the judge i meant for the fact that a company
[01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:26.320]   wouldn't sue you because you know they're saying themselves okay so you're preserving this
[01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:30.160]   information but you're not selling it and making money like i'm sure if they woke up the next day
[01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:34.560]   and they were making a billion dollars they'd be like whoa whoa whoa whoa yeah i need a cut of that
[01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:39.200]   i feel the same way i would if somebody wants to take all of our shows and put them on online
[01:10:39.200 --> 01:10:43.600]   in fact many people do that's fine if they make money on it that's a violation of and we're creative
[01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:48.160]   commons we're not even you know traditional copyright but that's uh you know that's that
[01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:54.320]   seems reasonable maybe they should make more things creative commons that would solve that
[01:10:54.320 --> 01:11:01.840]   problem non-commercial attribution share alike something like that well the apple situation is
[01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:06.480]   totally different because they're using it to make money so right they you know hey i use this to
[01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:11.680]   make money just don't take the ads out baby you can do anything you want with it all right three
[01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:17.920]   years of misery inside google we've got to do it got to do it i can't you know but i don't think
[01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:25.360]   this is a mean a mean article this is uh natashatiku writing uh wired the happiest company in tech and
[01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:29.840]   what it really is talking about is a google it's a little different and i bet a little different
[01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:35.760]   from when you worked at it matt yeah i think so uh employees walking out because they don't want
[01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:42.960]   google for instance to do uh a defense contracting right and that's one thing that google's always
[01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:48.080]   been is respectful for their employees because after all the valuable asset of google and the
[01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:54.160]   most valuable asset is not the hard drives of the servers or even sundar pachayats the engineers
[01:11:54.160 --> 01:12:01.920]   who write the code who keep it running and so in more so than almost any other kind of company
[01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:06.080]   employees at google have a lot of carry a lot of weight they do carry a lot of weight and it's
[01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:11.600]   super fascinating that um the culture of empowerment where people say they can push the big red button
[01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:16.000]   and say i think this is something evil and i've seen that happen where the company set a company
[01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:21.920]   wide goal and then one engineer stood up and said i think this is actually an evil goal and it kicked
[01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:26.320]   off a huge discussion which changed actually the course of how the company was planning to do
[01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:30.720]   those things see that's great that's a healthy culture but now google is a hundred thousand
[01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:35.280]   people and it's much harder to find you know what is the thing that every single person at
[01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:39.040]   google is going to agree on you're gonna have folks all across the spectrum who have strong
[01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:43.520]   thoughts on all kinds of different topics well and one of the problems uh that she writes about
[01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:48.960]   and this is that the troubles began with in 2016 with the election of president trump
[01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:57.120]   google wanted to keep as with any in business would want to do a low profile not not be critical
[01:12:57.120 --> 01:13:03.840]   because the president and the government can really weigh in as they have started to do now on your
[01:13:03.840 --> 01:13:10.560]   business it was kind of the strategy google google keep their head down but then came very early on
[01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:16.800]   the muslim ban the immigration ban and uh sergebrin one of the founders of google goes to the san
[01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:22.640]   francisco airport and protests he says he was very clear i'm not going as the founder of google i'm
[01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:30.800]   going as a as a private individual then there are walkouts at google uh employees uh had a uh
[01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:36.400]   a protest on a saturday night was it a saturday night it was after shortly after the saturday night
[01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:44.560]   protest at the airport and uh sundar pachay uh kind of was collared he went out he spoke
[01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:53.040]   uh and then the crowd starts going sir gay sir gay sir gay and sir gay has to speak
[01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:59.440]   and this is pretty much what google didn't want because they didn't they want this is that old
[01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:02.320]   thing you don't want to get your head above the crowd because then it gets chopped off
[01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:09.600]   um and as and of course the latest is you know the president says well we're going to investigate
[01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:18.480]   google uh and twitter but mostly google for uh blocking conservative thought and their search
[01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:25.200]   results um and then there's also the conversation in this article about james damor and more more
[01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:32.320]   than james damor uh an engineer who was less known damor wrote that memo uh was fired
[01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:38.000]   he he has filed a class action lawsuit against google but the memo was blatantly sexist saying
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:44.160]   women are not capable of programming and that's obviously wrong and inappropriate i think that
[01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:50.160]   there's good case to be made that if it employees says well this kind of person's no good at my job
[01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:55.280]   that's not the environment you want to create a google but then there's also kevin sernik
[01:14:55.280 --> 01:15:02.960]   serneki who is uh very active he has filed a charge of the national labor relations
[01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:07.600]   board after getting a warning he's still working there so it's a really interesting article kind
[01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:15.600]   of a trouble in paradise article i have a slightly different take okay good um like it's interesting
[01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:20.080]   because this is the story of the last three years and a lot of stuff has happened since you left
[01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:26.720]   yeah and it's it's almost like you know i was i was starting in dc in june of 2016 so i missed a
[01:15:26.720 --> 01:15:31.280]   lot of this stuff i didn't see the internal discussions but what is fascinating about it to
[01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:38.720]   me is whenever people would leave google before a typical response would be oh yes one person has
[01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:43.760]   left but look at these twelve amazing people who just joined right so the walkout is a different
[01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:49.920]   tactic you only get to quit once but you can do internal protests or walkouts and that can have
[01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:55.920]   a pretty sizable impact without you actually leaving but then my weird take is um i think we are
[01:15:55.920 --> 01:16:02.640]   at the point where a company that is a hundred thousand employees you can't just ascribe and say
[01:16:02.640 --> 01:16:07.200]   oh i'm a good person and i work for this company and i think this company is good i don't need to
[01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:11.680]   worry about the impact of all of my ethical decisions i'm going to outsource that to my company
[01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:18.560]   instead i think now you see that you there are plenty of opportunities for technology people to
[01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:23.680]   have more impact not at a large company trying to change from within but going and doing whether
[01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:28.160]   it's a startup or a nonprofit or working in government the kinds of things where you can have a really
[01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:33.120]   big impact where you might not be able to affect that change inside the large company anymore
[01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:39.680]   because it's so big it's just so big plus large companies uh agenda's shift a little bit for
[01:16:39.680 --> 01:16:45.200]   instance you want to make nice with the government that's in you know running the country you're in
[01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:50.080]   because they can make a lot of trouble for you you kind of and and i can understand why a google
[01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:54.800]   engineer will say well that that's none of my concern i'm gonna i'm gonna do what i think is right
[01:16:54.800 --> 01:17:00.800]   it's fascinating to me that you know there are thousands of designers and engineers and product
[01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:07.120]   managers at google but it is also the case that a very small number of people can have a very
[01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:12.800]   large impact whenever you're tackling a problem at a startup that's me is that you yeah that's okay
[01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:20.000]   it was listening for the um so it's fascinating to me that you can actually have like teams of four
[01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:26.720]   five people can have a disproportionate impact in civic tech for example as it should yeah go to
[01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:33.600]   work for usts i wasn't gonna make the pitch that well but if you want to i will absolutely
[01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:39.600]   and it's time to look go ahead uh go ahead zd and then uh and then oh doctor it's tempting to read
[01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:44.720]   this article and think oh google's got these huge sort of cultural problems but so does every
[01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:49.920]   company who has a hundred thousand people you know this is classic hr and employment law
[01:17:49.920 --> 01:17:56.160]   issues you know how are people going to express their views and what can and should they be fired
[01:17:56.160 --> 01:18:01.840]   for uh you know and that's a that's a judgment call on the part of management and and it's not
[01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:06.800]   unique to google i feel like they almost have been walking on coals and just need to get
[01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:13.280]   through these next few years as fast as possible not only that from the outside looking in from a
[01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:18.960]   regular joe i feel like google has one of the best mental health stability across the board as
[01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:24.320]   far as their employees go um the fact that you hear this kind of story where people are voicing
[01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:29.440]   their opinions and are walking out protesting whatever they're doing you don't hear anything
[01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:33.360]   out of other companies which means people are terrified to speak their mind or to speak their
[01:18:33.360 --> 01:18:37.760]   truth or to do what they feel is right and then you find out that these companies do horrible
[01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:43.920]   heinous things because no one thought to speak up and say anything against it so in general
[01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:47.840]   besides all the hoopla i'm like whenever i hear stuff like this from google right now i'm like
[01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:54.160]   well at least people are confident and competent enough to have a sensible opinion
[01:18:54.160 --> 01:18:59.040]   express that opinion in a certain way and then move on learn from it grow from it make a change
[01:18:59.040 --> 01:19:04.720]   don't make a change but it's healthy that this kind of conversation is being had from google
[01:19:04.720 --> 01:19:11.920]   yeah i agree i i i don't know if this article was intended to be negative about google
[01:19:11.920 --> 01:19:18.640]   but what i came away with is how kind of difficult it is and how well google is attempting to
[01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:24.800]   balance it without shutting down its employees they can't no they can't and uh you know i think
[01:19:25.520 --> 01:19:30.800]   probably well any large company you know in this day and age is in a point where there are going
[01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:36.000]   to be reactions not only to the news but you know the events of the day whatever it is and the best
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:39.920]   you can do is try to make sure that you have a supportive organization where people feel safe
[01:19:39.920 --> 01:19:44.640]   and they can bring their whole self to work i think that really matters and uh but you're never
[01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:49.200]   going to stop disagreements just like Denise pointed out like karst and i wasn't here on
[01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:55.520]   wednesday when this was discussed on this week in google did the the group come to a conclusion on
[01:19:55.520 --> 01:20:01.760]   that show uh was it a positive article or a negative article uh not really we didn't really
[01:20:01.760 --> 01:20:08.960]   come to a decision yeah yeah that's because i wasn't there i would have whipped them into shape
[01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:16.000]   no no it's you know what this is a kind of way it's supposed to be a negative article or i feel
[01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:22.800]   like the headline it's titled three years of misery kind of gives you the idea maybe it's negative
[01:20:22.800 --> 01:20:26.800]   but i didn't actually come away with that i came away with google's doing the best
[01:20:26.800 --> 01:20:31.520]   of can in a very difficult situation it's definitely clear that different people wrote the article
[01:20:31.520 --> 01:20:38.960]   and titled the article ah yeah that often happens doesn't it there's yeah the titles are rarely
[01:20:38.960 --> 01:20:45.600]   written by the author um i think it's you know what this is a microcosm of what must be happening
[01:20:45.600 --> 01:20:49.840]   in many countries companies around the country when there's big political division in the
[01:20:49.840 --> 01:20:54.000]   countries there is those divisions will be reflected inside any company that's large enough
[01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:58.880]   uh i'm sure we have political divisions here at twit
[01:20:58.880 --> 01:21:03.360]   because i suppress all dissent
[01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:10.400]   one two one yeah is that five now it's a five in the booth when you're voting like
[01:21:10.400 --> 01:21:15.200]   just keep letting you know i have cameras everywhere we just need a little kyron by the way can i
[01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:22.960]   say how angry i am speaking of google at nest they decided that you can't turn off the little red
[01:21:22.960 --> 01:21:28.400]   light or the little green light on the nest cameras really because it then you could spy on people
[01:21:28.400 --> 01:21:33.520]   okay so i have nest security cameras all around my house now i have bright green little lights all
[01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:39.920]   around my house and not even i don't feel sorry for you i feel sorry for my four i feel sorry for my
[01:21:40.480 --> 01:21:44.960]   friends that have kids that asked me how to turn the light off when i said you can't
[01:21:44.960 --> 01:21:48.000]   they have it in their baby's room and the babies just sit there like
[01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:54.880]   the light the green light i see the light one thing i can tell them was to go get gaffers tape that's
[01:21:54.880 --> 01:21:59.680]   what you do put it over their hundred dollar device that's what i'm gonna do i would do that if i were
[01:21:59.680 --> 01:22:05.200]   you we have laws in california and they're more protective of audio than they are a video
[01:22:05.840 --> 01:22:10.720]   so if you're recording someone's audio without their consent that is a bad bad thing
[01:22:10.720 --> 01:22:16.720]   well okay let me let me rephrase or anybody listen look at the gaffers tape over the camera
[01:22:16.720 --> 01:22:20.160]   but in front of your door we're gonna do like door dash doesn't put a little sticker on your
[01:22:20.160 --> 01:22:25.360]   front window this whole house is of the surveils you coming here we're filming you don't we have a
[01:22:25.360 --> 01:22:30.880]   sign at the door that says that we have a sign on our door we're legally covered and we made you
[01:22:30.880 --> 01:22:38.080]   guys sign a 400 page disclaimer right we got we got we got a good though we now we
[01:22:38.080 --> 01:22:43.280]   used to do it with paper so they could read it but now we put it on an iPad and they just go yeah
[01:22:43.280 --> 01:22:49.120]   yeah yeah people are so conditioned terms of service yeah yeah yeah yeah okay so we can i have to
[01:22:49.120 --> 01:22:58.080]   start sneaking stuff in there bitcoin yeah there's a comic book show five yet no you can make fun of
[01:22:58.080 --> 01:23:06.560]   bitcoin all you want there's a really fun videos of people who hear have a free ipad just click here
[01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:10.720]   and then through and you see how they've yeah didn't they do that on south part
[01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:17.440]   you've got our sporn yeah first point so um so you're saying Denise that i should leave the
[01:23:17.440 --> 01:23:23.840]   in if i'm recording in the studio as i am lights on please lights on there is a microphone and that
[01:23:23.840 --> 01:23:31.200]   should i disable the audio uh yeah i think that's probably prudent there's the only place they are
[01:23:31.200 --> 01:23:35.920]   is in this studio and the other studio they're in the studios where there are mics and cameras
[01:23:35.920 --> 01:23:41.920]   everywhere yeah and people do have to say that's a way for to enter but my employees is what you're
[01:23:41.920 --> 01:23:48.240]   talking about right Denise it's not these people in those seats it's everybody well a bit like you
[01:23:48.240 --> 01:23:52.560]   said you put disclaimers everywhere and and told people they're being recorded so that's a little
[01:23:52.560 --> 01:23:57.520]   bit different but yeah here's the question can i be sued by a criminal who's creeping around my house
[01:23:57.520 --> 01:24:03.120]   because i taped over the light uh on the camera outside my house on my property
[01:24:03.120 --> 01:24:11.200]   well it's a so like i said it's the audio conversation or the audio recording that would be um more
[01:24:11.200 --> 01:24:20.320]   problematic in california if you're in public uh and you're being photographed or videoed uh your
[01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:26.000]   expectations of privacy are drastically reduced so if someone is just outside your house they're
[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:31.280]   in a public place okay yeah i did i have to say i made a little tactical error it's aiming at the
[01:24:31.280 --> 01:24:40.000]   hot tub and and it does have a microphone and it turns out that it's right outside the bedroom
[01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:47.280]   window and so i probably should do something maybe just tape over the light just pure wear of the
[01:24:47.280 --> 01:24:54.080]   audio experience of your mid-to-party consent state we're a two-party state in california
[01:24:54.080 --> 01:25:01.520]   on the last thing about consent i watched a show where the devil made an app and inside the app
[01:25:01.520 --> 01:25:07.120]   is said when you sign up for the app that's free you're giving me your soul so he scared people into
[01:25:07.120 --> 01:25:11.360]   download in his app and was just collecting millions of millions of souls and i thought to myself see
[01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:15.040]   that could easily happen see the devil would have done that would be the greatest way for the
[01:25:15.040 --> 01:25:19.520]   devil to just rack up songs ever that this signing is your signing all this stuff you don't need to
[01:25:19.520 --> 01:25:25.920]   do that anymore just give me that like accept like name it instagram yeah like at least once a year
[01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:30.960]   somebody who who is a programmer put something into their terms of service to test whether people
[01:25:30.960 --> 01:25:35.520]   read it like the brown m&m's or whatever and people never do and they're like oh i accidentally
[01:25:35.520 --> 01:25:43.200]   got 700 souls today you know yeah well face app right that russian app that takes a picture of face
[01:25:43.200 --> 01:25:50.640]   ages it sends it back and then chuck schumer actually what yeah this is from fox news 7500
[01:25:50.640 --> 01:25:58.240]   online shoppers unknowingly sold their souls but you can't really sell your soul can't do
[01:25:58.240 --> 01:26:05.120]   i don't know i mean these are just these are stunts it's a stunt yeah yeah people believe
[01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:10.160]   that supreme court has not ruled yet on shrink wrap agreements with regards to selling souls
[01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:16.480]   because in mediation i don't know but this is why we need this week in law we got to bring that
[01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:22.320]   show back um by the way shrink wraps which this week in witchcraft yeah
[01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:29.840]   actually i think if we did this week in devilry we would get a lot of doubts oh oh yeah no doubt
[01:26:29.840 --> 01:26:33.600]   because you could that the little sub-sec undermarketing right now a definition of devilry
[01:26:33.600 --> 01:26:42.400]   devilry yeah never could twin i want to do twid and it would have horns episode one
[01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:50.480]   Owen's ass it's gonna be great it's gonna be great it's gonna be great i think it's a little
[01:26:50.480 --> 01:26:56.320]   devilry to name it the iphone 11 pro max is that real like are we gonna well so this is the
[01:26:56.320 --> 01:27:01.520]   other this is again rumor the idea i don't the pro max wow that's a little much uh super pro
[01:27:01.520 --> 01:27:08.320]   max double the idea is apple has pros in all of its lines the the thought is there might be
[01:27:08.320 --> 01:27:14.880]   at one high end iphone bigger screen type c connector not a lightning connector which i
[01:27:14.880 --> 01:27:20.160]   would frankly pay for yeah let's get rid of that lightning connector yeah apple wouldn't do it all
[01:27:20.160 --> 01:27:24.320]   at once because people would be furious they bought all those lightning accessories so you just do
[01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:27.520]   it with the pro one just like you do with the ipad pro right the ipad pro
[01:27:27.520 --> 01:27:32.560]   doesn't have lightning and that's type c so maybe like get an analog to the ipad pro
[01:27:32.560 --> 01:27:37.840]   and then of course you've got the problem which is that the iphone has regular sized and maxi
[01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:44.400]   so you're gonna have to if it's a pro will you have a pro max oh boy okay when that when that
[01:27:44.400 --> 01:27:48.560]   comes out i know it's a quick turnaround but just let me submit a rage video that you can play
[01:27:48.560 --> 01:27:54.160]   during that episode you can do it right away just they coordinate now we'll do it during the event
[01:27:54.720 --> 01:27:58.800]   it's so bad actually so bad here's a deal cars to make a note of this
[01:27:58.800 --> 01:28:05.440]   we will have o-doctor on the apple event when we live stream it okay so you can there we go you
[01:28:05.440 --> 01:28:11.680]   can rage react in real time there you go that'll be fun real time rage reactions dot com
[01:28:11.680 --> 01:28:14.480]   it cameras that camera is not as good as a pixel
[01:28:14.480 --> 01:28:21.520]   what are you you do you did use it did he see you look like an iphone user i'm an iphone user yeah
[01:28:21.520 --> 01:28:27.040]   happened from from version one yep i want to take wagers on how bad the name is could it be
[01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:34.400]   double secret pro max oh turbo double secret super pro max how now how much would you pay
[01:28:34.400 --> 01:28:42.320]   extra flow max flowmatic max we're talking before the show about grace hopper who wrote
[01:28:42.320 --> 01:28:47.600]   koball before she wrote koball she wrote a programming language called flowmatic
[01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:52.240]   which really should have survived yeah i think that would have been cool yeah
[01:28:52.240 --> 01:28:58.320]   google design direct so google's strategy with the pixel 4 is pretty cool because when the
[01:28:58.320 --> 01:29:05.280]   leaks got out they just tweeted it yeah uh google design director teases eight that there'll be 20
[01:29:05.280 --> 01:29:11.760]   x zoom on a pixel phone it was lying i'm not going to be happy until i whip out my pixel phone
[01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:15.840]   and it's all cameras the whole back is nothing but cameras like i gave it
[01:29:15.840 --> 01:29:23.440]   Claude zell wigger is that his real name really it sounds like Claude zellig claimed he chose
[01:29:23.440 --> 01:29:28.080]   he'd taken a shot on a pixel with 20 x he since clarified the photo was taken a 3a
[01:29:28.080 --> 01:29:35.280]   and he cropped the image although still that's pretty good so one thing oh doctor you're gonna
[01:29:35.280 --> 01:29:41.680]   have to give up the new pixel 4 will have multiple lenses probably i'm fine with that i'm just
[01:29:41.680 --> 01:29:46.240]   saying that i'm not against multiple lenses i'm saying that having multiple lenses and
[01:29:46.240 --> 01:29:49.440]   telling me that something's better is just a crutch and a sales point you keep putting these
[01:29:49.440 --> 01:29:53.200]   lenses on there but your software's still not as good again it's adequate and it's great i'm not
[01:29:53.200 --> 01:29:59.120]   saying it's bad on everything's even par the iphone has very great photos during the daytime
[01:29:59.120 --> 01:30:03.920]   when you're outside i don't think any camera really beats that uh the samson has super sharp
[01:30:03.920 --> 01:30:08.400]   photos and if you want to take a picture of like 42 buildings at once you got the ultra wide that's
[01:30:08.400 --> 01:30:14.400]   great but when it comes down to day to day shot for shot just taking pictures the pixel destroys
[01:30:14.400 --> 01:30:22.640]   them over and over this is your next phone oh doctor it's the light l 16 camera this has
[01:30:22.640 --> 01:30:30.960]   ever come out it's sold out cameras everywhere oh maybe they only made none it's sold out because
[01:30:30.960 --> 01:30:36.960]   nobody bought anymore they sold out cameras on your camera it looks honestly i want that it looks
[01:30:36.960 --> 01:30:43.280]   like a b-z-i you know it's real it is real what's it say oh my gosh scoble was like the first
[01:30:43.280 --> 01:30:48.640]   percussive course scoble had one it had a thing like a two years before it came out and he was
[01:30:48.640 --> 01:30:51.760]   talking about how he was going to change the world and then for a year it never came out then
[01:30:51.760 --> 01:30:55.040]   another year it never came out and then apparently whenever it came out in the dark because i didn't
[01:30:55.040 --> 01:30:59.360]   hear it actually launching it sells out and they're not making anymore i i don't know if i want to
[01:30:59.360 --> 01:31:03.440]   leave should i i want to see if i can tell you i should have gotten one yeah i just want nothing
[01:31:03.440 --> 01:31:08.160]   cameras should have gotten one all cameras all the time oh and you may be protecting your client
[01:31:08.160 --> 01:31:15.520]   list but did claw clawed clawed call you for oh and das to apologize how he took the picture oh
[01:31:15.520 --> 01:31:22.000]   yeah clawed should exactly it should be about the misquote because it wasn't 20x it was cropped
[01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:30.160]   it was it was a misquoted that's all i was second i had a context seen pixel over here even i
[01:31:30.160 --> 01:31:34.480]   hit my daily drives and iphone my backup phone is pixel so google was
[01:31:34.480 --> 01:31:39.920]   dinged of course by the eu and one of the things that eu find them what was a fine it was huge
[01:31:39.920 --> 01:31:48.640]   for was dominating using its monopoly in androids to force people to use the chrome browser on
[01:31:48.640 --> 01:31:55.440]   their phone so google's response was a browser ballot they didn't say the eu didn't say they couldn't
[01:31:56.320 --> 01:32:01.360]   profit from this search engine i'm sorry search engine ballot not a browser ballot but same
[01:32:01.360 --> 01:32:07.120]   ideas the old browser ballot the microsoft had to do in the uh eu the idea is when you first
[01:32:07.120 --> 01:32:12.880]   boot up an android phone you'll be presented with a ballot uh or just a box saying which
[01:32:12.880 --> 01:32:21.280]   search engine do you want to use but it turns out google was charging to be on that ballot
[01:32:22.720 --> 01:32:27.200]   and we know that they had an auction yeah they were auctioning it off we know that because
[01:32:27.200 --> 01:32:31.840]   there's an ethical search engine which we all learned about after this article
[01:32:31.840 --> 01:32:36.880]   called ecosia the whole it's a german company the whole idea is that every time you use a search
[01:32:36.880 --> 01:32:43.040]   engine they plant a tree uh and they planted a lot of trees they said the google auction was an
[01:32:43.040 --> 01:32:46.880]   insult to the european commission into the principal of equality in front of the law and they said
[01:32:46.880 --> 01:32:54.560]   we are not participating so we won't be on the ballot can i just say so i hadn't heard of ecosia
[01:32:54.560 --> 01:33:00.400]   before today nobody has um this was brilliant of them to do what they did i do love their f_a_q
[01:33:00.400 --> 01:33:06.000]   it's like does one search finance one new tree and they're like no it takes approximately 45 searches
[01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:11.440]   to finance the planting of one tree well oh wow how many sir i've actually no that's great
[01:33:11.440 --> 01:33:16.240]   and they're trying to do carbon neutral right because what people don't realize really is that
[01:33:16.240 --> 01:33:22.160]   every search they do uses energy yeah but there were there were some huge mis estimates of how much
[01:33:22.160 --> 01:33:26.640]   and it like at one point there was an article that said to do it to run one search is the amount
[01:33:26.640 --> 01:33:32.560]   of heat to make a cup of tea which was off by like two or three orders of magnitude if i remember
[01:33:32.560 --> 01:33:38.240]   really poorly configured network operations center yeah that's using fans instead of air
[01:33:38.240 --> 01:33:43.440]   conditioning or something i don't know yeah so how much do you know how much energy it uses
[01:33:43.440 --> 01:33:50.320]   it he's he's visited a data center so google in the audience is being put on the spot right now
[01:33:50.320 --> 01:33:55.120]   that's no but you but you kind of do this you you you would charge this kind of stuff aren't you
[01:33:55.120 --> 01:34:00.320]   he's sort of he's like they could do it with don't show his face the poor guy we don't want to
[01:34:00.320 --> 01:34:06.960]   talk so he was one tree he doesn't work at google i made that up if you if you put a cup of water room
[01:34:06.960 --> 01:34:13.840]   temperature on a server it would boil it with a t nothing okay it would boil after like three days
[01:34:13.840 --> 01:34:22.640]   okay but what the frog jumped out no it was just people just be making up stuff to say stuff it's
[01:34:22.640 --> 01:34:27.600]   like i want to start tracking people tell me mega jules or 42 000 with the war guide like you
[01:34:27.600 --> 01:34:31.600]   you shouldn't believe anything you read on the internet you're really i want someone to pull
[01:34:31.600 --> 01:34:35.680]   out a rack server someone in a surf form right now you i know one of you nerds is listening to this
[01:34:35.680 --> 01:34:41.760]   show pull out a rack put a cup of water on there with a t bag in it and then time lapsed and i need
[01:34:41.760 --> 01:34:49.840]   to know how long it takes to boil water to you up yes but with google as chacha says the frog is
[01:34:49.840 --> 01:34:57.440]   the customer oh that's deep i will say i personally did you ever cook an egg on a data server
[01:34:58.480 --> 01:35:06.320]   no so there was one interesting time when randalman roe from xkcd tried to reverse engineer i forget
[01:35:06.320 --> 01:35:11.440]   if it was like how many servers google had or something like that and the amount of nerd
[01:35:11.440 --> 01:35:15.840]   devil read that happened where all the googlers internally are discussing it and then all the
[01:35:15.840 --> 01:35:19.520]   people external are discussing it's like what did he get wrong in his assumptions that's so great
[01:35:19.520 --> 01:35:24.160]   that was a lot of fun to watch for inside he will be on triangular yes end of september he's got a new
[01:35:24.160 --> 01:35:30.080]   book the end of august oh end of august august august 30th uh randalman roe will be my guest
[01:35:30.080 --> 01:35:35.440]   on a very special triangulation i heard really looking bring that question up i want to hear
[01:35:35.440 --> 01:35:44.080]   the details yeah uh his new book is is it uh is it xkcd stuff what is it i think it's i have it on my
[01:35:44.080 --> 01:35:49.920]   desk it is uh it is uh really complicated explanations for really simple
[01:35:49.920 --> 01:35:57.120]   problem perfect i love it there's one where serena williams takes on drones oh i can't wait
[01:35:57.120 --> 01:36:00.400]   like what is the most what is the best sports equipment to kill a drone
[01:36:00.400 --> 01:36:08.080]   so i'm on the leo yes um pretty soon we're going to talk about vpans and how to protect
[01:36:08.080 --> 01:36:12.000]   computers because we're gonna do it right now i use i have but before you do that i have one
[01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:16.960]   question to ask you yes you keep talking about the samson did you get the 5g version no what do
[01:36:16.960 --> 01:36:23.120]   you think i'm nuts okay so i know i did spend extra for the ceramic back the one terabyte storage
[01:36:23.120 --> 01:36:27.680]   in the 12 gigabytes that when you can find it i can't do you know i can't be right and egg on this one
[01:36:27.680 --> 01:36:32.560]   it's beautiful actually ceramic service makes an excellent cook you know what happens when you get
[01:36:32.560 --> 01:36:39.680]   the 5g version of the samson phone no what you get put into a premium 5g plan and you have to pay
[01:36:39.680 --> 01:36:44.720]   30 extra a month even if you don't have 5g in your neck of the woods not even if you don't have 5g
[01:36:44.720 --> 01:36:49.360]   there is no 5g so you're already paying for something that doesn't exist oh that's such a
[01:36:49.360 --> 01:36:54.240]   scam such a scam and it's embarrassing that that company did that with hardware
[01:36:54.240 --> 01:36:57.920]   charging 50 dollars off the tip and then sprint and whoever else wants to do it
[01:36:57.920 --> 01:37:03.200]   every other company's making these five this is gonna be are they charging you more money
[01:37:03.200 --> 01:37:08.000]   are they charging you more money because most of them just say 5g this one has a 5g version that's
[01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:14.560]   50 more yeah who else just announced a 5g phone and motorola has a 5g back for their phone and
[01:37:14.560 --> 01:37:20.720]   i mean you can get 5g phones i imagine it's saying every 5g service but you got a hit of 5g premium

[01:39:18.560 --> 01:39:25.360]   else takes their cut i'll get a penny our show today brought to you by express vp and i was talking
[01:39:25.360 --> 01:39:29.760]   about this with a caller on the radio show today to explain he was asking about vp ends
[01:39:29.760 --> 01:39:35.520]   and i pointed out the the okay so why would you want to use a vp at a vp and we all first
[01:39:35.520 --> 01:39:40.800]   experience these at work because if you had a corporate internal network you couldn't very
[01:39:40.800 --> 01:39:46.160]   well log into it from the outside world without exposing it to the outside world so companies
[01:39:46.160 --> 01:39:51.360]   created virtual private networks you would use software usually from sisco on your computer man
[01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:55.760]   i remember those days where such a pain it could figure and then you'd use it and you'd log into
[01:39:55.760 --> 01:39:59.840]   the corporate network and you'd have an encrypted tunnel the corporate network and that way you
[01:39:59.840 --> 01:40:05.360]   could use it as if you were on the premises even though you were at home it was very cool somebody
[01:40:05.360 --> 01:40:09.840]   some bright fella said hey you know the cool thing about this isn't that i'm using the corporate
[01:40:09.840 --> 01:40:13.600]   network at work because i don't want to work at home anyway the cool thing about this is no one
[01:40:14.480 --> 01:40:18.960]   my internet service provider the hacker in the corner at the coffee shop can see what i'm doing
[01:40:18.960 --> 01:40:24.640]   i'm in private we should create a business of vp and so they put vp number there many companies
[01:40:24.640 --> 01:40:29.120]   that do this now they put vp and servers like the one you had your company but they put them in the
[01:40:29.120 --> 01:40:34.160]   outside world and you connect to it and then into the outside world but here's the problem
[01:40:34.160 --> 01:40:40.800]   it just kicks the privacy security can down the road yes the hacker in the coffee shop can't see
[01:40:40.800 --> 01:40:46.080]   you your ISP can't see what you're doing you can emerge onto the internet in the country of your
[01:40:46.080 --> 01:40:53.040]   choice wherever that server lives that's really cool but you have to trust the host that's the key
[01:40:53.040 --> 01:40:59.120]   because everything that the bad guys could do if you did it without a vp and the vp and service
[01:40:59.120 --> 01:41:03.200]   can do so it's really important when you choose a vp and to choose carefully that's why i use
[01:41:03.200 --> 01:41:10.400]   express vp and first of all express vp and has been audited by third parties so we know they do
[01:41:10.400 --> 01:41:14.880]   exactly what they did the third party even audited their new cutting edge server technology
[01:41:14.880 --> 01:41:20.000]   express vp and calls it trusted server which prevents the operating system and apps from ever
[01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:26.800]   writing to the hard drive that's the the operating system on the server side so not only no logging
[01:41:26.800 --> 01:41:32.000]   no nothing it's a whole new standard of privacy and security the third party did the auditor said
[01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:40.880]   yes it works exactly as we said express vp and cannot track you and more importantly cannot offer
[01:41:40.880 --> 01:41:47.200]   your information to anybody else and we know this is the case because express vp and authoritarian
[01:41:47.200 --> 01:41:52.320]   governments have come in happened in turkey a couple of years ago and actually without subpoena
[01:41:52.320 --> 01:41:59.440]   just taking the express vp and server they found nothing there's nothing on it so you are absolutely
[01:41:59.440 --> 01:42:05.200]   private you are absolutely protected express vp and it's easy to use too like those days of
[01:42:05.200 --> 01:42:09.600]   sisco and that getting that thing to run man that was a nightmare it never worked right i had to
[01:42:09.600 --> 01:42:15.040]   get the it department now it's one button you download the app you click to connect you're protected
[01:42:15.040 --> 01:42:21.120]   it's the fastest vp and you'll ever use because they do it right servers all over the world
[01:42:21.120 --> 01:42:26.880]   it costs less than seven dollars a month and it has a 30-day money back guarantee so you're not at
[01:42:26.880 --> 01:42:32.480]   risk stop hackers stop big brother stop internet companies from grabbing your data hacking your
[01:42:32.480 --> 01:42:38.640]   systems take back your online privacy protect yourself with express vp and you're going to put
[01:42:38.640 --> 01:42:46.080]   trust in a vp and company make sure you use the one i recommend everybody recommends express vp

[01:45:48.560 --> 01:45:55.200]   did read the george rr martin said that the tv show was a real hindrance to him finishing it
[01:45:55.200 --> 01:46:04.080]   it was and well his excuse was he was too famous and rich now mmm but it's all in life he said i
[01:46:04.080 --> 01:46:10.160]   can't go to conventions anymore it's just me posing for selfies for four hours that's no fun it's not
[01:46:10.160 --> 01:46:15.760]   like he was writing books at convention so that's a dumb reason is the tv show was killing off the
[01:46:15.760 --> 01:46:20.160]   wrong people it condenses oh that's right he said he couldn't do what he wanted said no no he
[01:46:20.160 --> 01:46:24.400]   might as well wait till they ruin it and fix it that's what he's gonna do he said well you might
[01:46:24.400 --> 01:46:29.920]   have seen the tv show but that i do not feel obligated in any way to follow that storyline so there's
[01:46:29.920 --> 01:46:35.440]   two more books it's not canon because the canon doesn't exist but there's two more books coming he's
[01:46:35.440 --> 01:46:40.720]   writing them the problem is he also he said i should be writing 40 pages a day i'm doing four oh so do the
[01:46:40.720 --> 01:46:49.600]   math the food well i am making money by typing four letters a day why am i even bothering to continue

[01:46:55.120 --> 01:47:00.400]   ron come on come on what a great book and he has no excuse he's made no money there's no tv show
[01:47:00.400 --> 01:47:05.280]   we don't he has no he's not famous he's no excuse he's probably doing a lot of selfies it's just a
[01:47:05.280 --> 01:47:11.440]   lot of people like you me and tres rakliff going patrick we need more we need more we need more
[01:47:11.440 --> 01:47:16.800]   i forgot what happened i'd have to reread the whole thing that's a secret plan to sell more books
[01:47:16.800 --> 01:47:22.320]   yeah amazon's recognition once again face recognition fails the aclu
[01:47:22.320 --> 01:47:29.680]   as wait hold on i just i just have to while we're still in this topic king killer chronicle tv
[01:47:29.680 --> 01:47:38.800]   show premiere episode features lyn manuel maranda song oh no is it is coming so he does have a
[01:47:38.800 --> 01:47:43.200]   this the tv excuse so he'll never have to write that book he has been working on the tv show yeah
[01:47:43.200 --> 01:47:48.080]   but you know what he's ruined if lyn manuel maranda's in it what is this gonna be the rap version of
[01:47:48.080 --> 01:47:53.440]   name of the wind so he can be the wind the musical we can't be hipsters anymore i like to be four
[01:47:53.440 --> 01:48:00.400]   in one song he can make one song he made one song in mawah mawahana didn't i didn't ruin it
[01:48:00.400 --> 01:48:04.640]   so book three is moving forward but not fast
[01:48:04.640 --> 01:48:10.800]   says author we all know that it's not moving forward fast i like it the news week has decided
[01:48:10.800 --> 01:48:16.640]   you know this whole thing about politics the news we're gonna be the king killer chronicles
[01:48:17.360 --> 01:48:22.320]   journal of record plus he sports any sports it's the future
[01:48:22.320 --> 01:48:28.080]   and then apparently they have a feature on woodstock and photos so they're really you know they're
[01:48:28.080 --> 01:48:37.440]   really keeping up with the times wow wow all right um well well maryana is is in his dark materials
[01:48:37.440 --> 01:48:43.440]   though oh yeah he is in that he's doing all the shows there will never be another hamilton
[01:48:43.440 --> 01:48:49.440]   uh amazon's recognition aclu tweeted about the test on tuesday
[01:48:49.440 --> 01:48:56.640]   the uh recognition face recognition software wrongly flagged 26 california lawmakers as criminals
[01:48:56.640 --> 01:49:04.880]   allegedly allegedly that's pretty brilliant one false match is one too many uh face recognition
[01:49:04.880 --> 01:49:10.640]   erroneously match the faces of these legislators with images in an arrest photo database by the way
[01:49:10.640 --> 01:49:17.840]   i want to point out that only a few of them are people of color so uh it's just false positives
[01:49:17.840 --> 01:49:24.080]   across the spectrum they're getting better they're messing up white people too now which is good
[01:49:24.080 --> 01:49:31.600]   that's a step forward um progress progress progress progress i consider this a public service on
[01:49:31.600 --> 01:49:36.400]   the part of amazon because this is how we get lawmakers to pay attention to issues around
[01:49:36.400 --> 01:49:41.360]   facial recognition uh and then when they fix it for lawmakers they can do it for lawmakers
[01:49:41.360 --> 01:49:47.920]   it's the aclu so um amazon's recognition does give a confidence score
[01:49:47.920 --> 01:49:54.160]   uh but the aclu you know in other words we think this is 100 accurate or this is you know 50
[01:49:54.160 --> 01:49:58.880]   percent accurate but the aclu says amazon knowingly misleads the public about the uh software
[01:49:58.880 --> 01:50:03.840]   amazon knows with 100 certainly that its law enforcement customers are using lower
[01:50:03.840 --> 01:50:08.800]   confidence scores or no score at all when using the customers uh the company's system
[01:50:08.800 --> 01:50:16.640]   uh that's not good so face recognition has some problems i think there are reasonable places to
[01:50:16.640 --> 01:50:23.520]   use it like well at taylor swift uses it at concerts to keep no because there's known stalkers
[01:50:23.520 --> 01:50:27.040]   and troublemakers and it just keeps them out of the concert i did not expect you to go the
[01:50:27.040 --> 01:50:32.320]   taylor swift anchor that tay tay tay can use it tay tay can use it i will say i was renting a car
[01:50:32.320 --> 01:50:36.640]   this morning and pulling out of the rental place and they're like oh you can use clear
[01:50:36.640 --> 01:50:41.120]   just roll down the window and look at the camera to check out your rental car and that's the moment
[01:50:41.120 --> 01:50:48.720]   when i was like huh i'm not sure i really i'm on a clear we use clear coming home from orlando
[01:50:48.720 --> 01:50:54.320]   on friday i love clear when i put my fingers on well usually it is finger or iris but i used
[01:50:54.320 --> 01:50:59.360]   your face but i was looking into your maybe it saw your irises you think it's uh because you never
[01:50:59.360 --> 01:51:04.800]   gave them your face clear you give them your fingerprint and your irises right so so you're
[01:51:04.800 --> 01:51:10.960]   the government guy matt where are you using clear instead of global entry i uh i have global entry in
[01:51:10.960 --> 01:51:14.400]   fact the u.s. general service helped work make that better unfortunately the rental car company
[01:51:14.400 --> 01:51:20.080]   doesn't have global entry it doesn't but also uh i i have clear like as a complimentary thing for
[01:51:20.080 --> 01:51:24.720]   no yeah clear is great it lets you into concerts it lets you into uh really correct cars with it
[01:51:24.720 --> 01:51:29.840]   i just grab a hurt matt i'm gonna go matt i mean matt i can hook it with my mask i actually worry
[01:51:29.840 --> 01:51:35.440]   about it i'm going to be and consider you know i mean giving the government all your information
[01:51:35.440 --> 01:51:40.400]   to make your life easier is one thing we are giving giving information to a third party commercial
[01:51:40.400 --> 01:51:46.880]   entity is is another thing do you do you uh do you wear a mask in public then he's how do you prevent
[01:51:46.880 --> 01:51:52.640]   that have you seen there is that guy there's the guy i was actually googling for the story who
[01:51:52.640 --> 01:51:57.600]   made a mask of his own face yeah then he will sell for everyone else to wear and i was thinking
[01:51:57.600 --> 01:52:02.000]   he should be that guy yeah yeah now we know what he looks like because o doctor's wearing that mask
[01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:08.000]   yeah but it said well many people don't know this but the niece is actually a 22 year old fashion
[01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:13.840]   blogger from japan there you go i know i'm here that you can do anything four year old there you go
[01:52:13.840 --> 01:52:18.560]   did you see the guy who used uh made a california lysis plate called no
[01:52:20.080 --> 01:52:26.640]   no he's lysis plate was no no bad which is a i mean that's great he thought foolishly
[01:52:26.640 --> 01:52:33.600]   joseph tataro he thought that uh he was a security researcher he wanted he wanted seg fault no not
[01:52:33.600 --> 01:52:39.840]   available uh he started typing no pointer but it's caught himself after he typed the first word
[01:52:39.840 --> 01:52:43.760]   he said you know it'd be funny if i could get no or maybe void for my wife so that our cars would
[01:52:43.760 --> 01:52:51.920]   be null and void kind of a mistake he could explain this at defcon last week null is a text string
[01:52:51.920 --> 01:52:56.320]   that in many programming languages as you know signifies a value that's empty or undefined
[01:52:56.320 --> 01:53:06.240]   could be the false is null right yeah uh he was facing 12,049 of wrong traffic fine sent his way
[01:53:06.240 --> 01:53:11.760]   because the null plate didn't get him out of tickets it got him into tickets
[01:53:11.760 --> 01:53:17.920]   it it broke the dmv website by the way you can no longer get null
[01:53:17.920 --> 01:53:27.760]   uh it's invalid dozens of citations deposited in bulk into his mailbox parking violations
[01:53:27.760 --> 01:53:33.200]   stand stop violations fresno dorancho kukomanga he says i've never been to fresno
[01:53:34.320 --> 01:53:37.440]   he hasn't gone to the statewide parking related crime spree
[01:53:37.440 --> 01:53:42.880]   it turns out if you go ahead if you wanted to commit a crime spree like what if i just wanted
[01:53:42.880 --> 01:53:47.600]   to commit crime i put null on there and i go commit all these crimes and come back sit home like
[01:53:47.600 --> 01:53:51.600]   i didn't do anything wrong like look at all the other glitches he can park anywhere he was after
[01:53:51.600 --> 01:53:57.760]   little investigation i turned it out if the ticketing officer forgot to write a license plate number on
[01:53:57.760 --> 01:54:04.880]   the ticket guess what the license plate number was no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no
[01:54:04.880 --> 01:54:13.840]   he's getting every ticket in california without a not licensed number that is amazing but he
[01:54:13.840 --> 01:54:18.400]   also got stuck because at the end of the article it said he he wants to change it but he can't change
[01:54:18.400 --> 01:54:25.120]   it because they won't accept the because well no he but he he got little johnny tables strikes
[01:54:25.120 --> 01:54:32.880]   again little bobby tables strikes again um so he wow he caught a tiger by the tail with no
[01:54:32.880 --> 01:54:40.080]   yeah in related news the 22 year old fashion blogger alter ego of mine wants you to know that
[01:54:40.080 --> 01:54:49.440]   designer kate rose presented an adversarial fashion line at defcon uh that uh is clothing made to
[01:54:49.440 --> 01:54:54.800]   confuse license plate readers and it's pictures of license plates all over your t-shirt
[01:54:54.800 --> 01:55:00.560]   oh one of the text of the license plate in one of them is actually the text of the fourth amendment
[01:55:00.560 --> 01:55:04.400]   nice it's not the most attractive outerwear i've ever seen but
[01:55:04.400 --> 01:55:11.680]   you have to fight for liberty you gotta fight for liberty you know i could see hackers all over
[01:55:11.680 --> 01:55:17.440]   the country wearing this it's the company by the way is now called adversarial fashion
[01:55:18.800 --> 01:55:23.440]   i like it she's it both a fashion designer and a digital security professional
[01:55:23.440 --> 01:55:29.360]   that's how you don't hear that a lot yes she's only got one instagram poster she's gonna go hard
[01:55:29.360 --> 01:55:35.680]   in on fashion she needs to up the ante on the volume there but here's uh here's proof kate rose
[01:55:35.680 --> 01:55:41.200]   published this i guess uh somebody wearing her t-shirt and then getting the identification
[01:55:41.200 --> 01:55:47.760]   and uh it actually identified it you can see it's very confused it's circling a bunch of license
[01:55:47.760 --> 01:55:53.280]   plates it came up with three different license plates and decided that this guy is it as you
[01:55:53.280 --> 01:56:01.840]   v cross over which is really insulting so if so then you should just wear shirts that have people's
[01:56:01.840 --> 01:56:08.880]   like pictures of people's faces because okay so the 2018 marine core marathon t-shirt i ran
[01:56:08.880 --> 01:56:14.000]   that marathon and the whole front of that t-shirt is nothing but people's faces at the beginning of
[01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:20.320]   the race and so you could match that just as well and then yeah it would it would throw them off
[01:56:20.320 --> 01:56:26.240]   this is the most horrifying of all these stories it turns out you know what juggalos are of course
[01:56:26.240 --> 01:56:35.520]   you look like an insane clown posse fan oh doctor do you juggle those yeah so people who are fans
[01:56:35.520 --> 01:56:42.480]   of the insane clown posse often put clown makeup on to show their fandom they call it juggalo makeup
[01:56:43.040 --> 01:56:47.040]   and apparently it also uh
[01:56:47.040 --> 01:56:56.160]   works so i would be really disappointing if people started walking around with juggalo makeup that
[01:56:56.160 --> 01:57:04.080]   would be you know in war two for vendetta yeah in war two the painted the ships to be you know oh
[01:57:04.080 --> 01:57:12.640]   yeah that weird zebra cut yeah so juggalos or chips the the way makeup is nowadays anyway
[01:57:12.640 --> 01:57:17.200]   there's people out there making themselves up with makeup to look like jz and they're white
[01:57:17.200 --> 01:57:21.120]   like the shading of makeup is so people are transforming their faces women have been
[01:57:21.120 --> 01:57:26.640]   transforming their faces for decades so i mean there's ways to get around all this stuff
[01:57:26.640 --> 01:57:30.480]   i hear in these streets with just some uh maybe it's maybe Lee you know i mean you don't have to go
[01:57:30.480 --> 01:57:38.000]   that far here is change up height from the defcon presentation a sample slide of the face recognition
[01:57:38.640 --> 01:57:43.040]   failing although i figure those tattoo those tattoos probably pretty distinctive
[01:57:43.040 --> 01:57:49.440]   also i'm gonna take a few points off because the editor this guy's using to show his code is
[01:57:49.440 --> 01:57:55.360]   nano okay i'm sorry dude come on really nano gotta use vi got it
[01:57:55.360 --> 01:58:03.600]   you're not your t-max of course i mean that the only one true yo i already told you i love lisp
[01:58:03.600 --> 01:58:08.960]   why would i use the only editor you can reprogram as it's running in lisp i had no idea
[01:58:08.960 --> 01:58:15.440]   wow i just assumed you're in the vi class it's kind of cool i know vi you're very kind you're very
[01:58:15.440 --> 01:58:21.440]   kind it's a little too modal for me i like the modal stuff oh gosh oh scape holy
[01:58:21.440 --> 01:58:30.320]   cue come on uh by the way if you're listening to this conversation and you're going huh you
[01:58:30.320 --> 01:58:36.800]   probably should update windows right now microsoft warns windows 10 users uh this happened on
[01:58:36.800 --> 01:58:44.480]   wednesday to update immediately this is just a non-stop story of sadness there is now another
[01:58:44.480 --> 01:58:51.760]   actually four more rds vulnerabilities they're moat desktop service they're all for warmable which
[01:58:51.760 --> 01:58:59.920]   means if you get uh the exploit on your computer it will immediately go out through the network
[01:58:59.920 --> 01:59:04.480]   warm its way to every computer on your company's network and bring them all to their knees
[01:59:04.480 --> 01:59:11.440]   microsoft's simon pope director of indecent response i'm sorry incident response
[01:59:11.440 --> 01:59:17.680]   uh said it's important that effective systems are patched as quickly as possible
[01:59:17.680 --> 01:59:24.080]   because of the elevated risk associated with wormable vulnerabilities so get your downloads patch
[01:59:24.080 --> 01:59:31.920]   tuesday fortunately was the next day i presume i hope patch tuesday affixed it ironically windows
[01:59:31.920 --> 01:59:40.160]   xp not affected windows 10 yes not so much not so safe uh this is just an endless
[01:59:40.160 --> 01:59:45.040]   but i put this in more as a public service announcement the first thing i did when i set
[01:59:45.040 --> 01:59:51.600]   down today as you noticed was immediately update uh because that would be bad and you know uh the
[01:59:51.600 --> 01:59:56.640]   joke i made before the show started i know go ahead chromebook pixel not that wormable not so
[01:59:56.640 --> 02:00:04.400]   wormable not so wormable if they had a screen this big they might for all i know that would go down
[02:00:04.400 --> 02:00:09.040]   at 25 degrees to get out of the way this is such a by the way this is replacing the surface studio
[02:00:09.040 --> 02:00:15.280]   that was here i am now using a lnova and remember the surface studio had a little knob that you put
[02:00:15.280 --> 02:00:19.760]   on the screen this has a little knob that's a usb knob you plug into that you could put on
[02:00:19.760 --> 02:00:25.200]   either side if you're lefty i'm a lefty so put it on the right and it has double double knob
[02:00:25.200 --> 02:00:32.480]   edge you press the button it it opens the menu or mutes i don't know what doing both you you if
[02:00:32.480 --> 02:00:37.840]   you turn the knob here let me show you i'll go to a website so you can see this in action if i turn
[02:00:37.840 --> 02:00:45.760]   knob one it zooms in or out nice perfect turn the other knob it scrolls up or down nice pretty sweet
[02:00:45.760 --> 02:00:49.760]   huh i didn't even know i needed a knob you need a knob do you have to add on the pixel no
[02:00:49.760 --> 02:00:55.040]   maybe i'm wormable but at least i have a knob that's a good knob i got a
[02:00:55.040 --> 02:01:00.480]   solution where did that where did that surface go huh it had a big knob um your doppelganger
[02:01:00.480 --> 02:01:05.840]   ant pruit got it okay did you did you have the knob that i'm giving the knob to ant
[02:01:05.840 --> 02:01:13.440]   ant gets the knob knobs are important knob as it's go ahead i only want my dogs and cats to be
[02:01:13.440 --> 02:01:20.480]   wormable that's not my knobble devices love it there is a new bluetooth attack called
[02:01:20.480 --> 02:01:29.680]   coincidence i think not knob key negotiation of bluetooth attack this is this is really an example
[02:01:29.680 --> 02:01:34.400]   of just dumb design laren saberins writing and bleeping computer i bet i'm sure steve talked about
[02:01:34.400 --> 02:01:38.880]   i hope he did if he didn't last tuesday i'll talk about this tuesday and security now so it turns
[02:01:38.880 --> 02:01:45.760]   out you can send to bluetooth a command that says make your key any arbitrary length including
[02:01:45.760 --> 02:01:53.600]   a single octet oh so what is it how many choices are there in an octet eight that'd be 256
[02:01:53.600 --> 02:02:00.240]   250 so octet is one two is a eight bits so i would assume 256 which means you know brute force
[02:02:00.240 --> 02:02:08.560]   attack would only take 256 tries so bad so bad so bad been sucking for how many years oh man
[02:02:09.280 --> 02:02:13.840]   well apparently not all bluetooth specifications say there's a minimum encryption key length so
[02:02:13.840 --> 02:02:20.000]   you can say you could specify one the length should be one um yeah that's a silly one although
[02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:25.200]   microsoft has patched this uh affect a lot of patches have gone out blackberry sisco google has
[02:02:25.200 --> 02:02:30.560]   patched it on android uh so it's already been patched probably on your device bluetooth is a
[02:02:30.560 --> 02:02:34.880]   nightmare bluetooth lee has made it even worse i mentioned this the uh couple of weeks ago i was
[02:02:34.880 --> 02:02:41.040]   bicycling around and i have a helmet that's got bluetooth all right i'm stupid i have a bluetooth
[02:02:41.040 --> 02:02:47.600]   helmet and i was trying to pair my phone to my helmet and so i because that way i can listen to
[02:02:47.600 --> 02:02:54.960]   a audiobook swan bicycle around and um i'm looking at the phone which is searching for bluetooth not
[02:02:54.960 --> 02:02:58.960]   only does it seem my helmet but as i'm driving it sees hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of bluetooth
[02:02:58.960 --> 02:03:04.640]   lee implementations you're blue driving i'm blue you could war driving forget blue driving is it because
[02:03:04.640 --> 02:03:11.920]   you can you could blast you could blast in saying clown posse to every house on the street because
[02:03:11.920 --> 02:03:15.600]   every one of them's got a bluetooth speaker saying send me something anything whatever what do you
[02:03:15.600 --> 02:03:22.560]   got anything the cars are up to two yes i saw cars i saw every i saw refrigerators i saw every
[02:03:22.560 --> 02:03:27.360]   have to say connect for it to connect you just out here it's a blue just lee remember this blue
[02:03:27.360 --> 02:03:32.880]   to zelly the whole idea bluetooth lee was to make it really easy sorry so you don't have to pair or
[02:03:32.880 --> 02:03:37.520]   anything that parry is such annoying saying is the fridge playing insane clown posse
[02:03:37.520 --> 02:03:49.360]   this is i'm gonna do that there's a i forget what movie it is but there's some movie a comedy
[02:03:49.360 --> 02:03:53.360]   where the kid would roll up to his parents how his friend's parents house and he would be
[02:03:53.360 --> 02:03:58.880]   born on the apple tv every time he would just watch the family run around trying to turn it off
[02:03:58.880 --> 02:04:05.120]   why is it doing that why are there why are there people doing that i think the movie was but it
[02:04:05.120 --> 02:04:11.360]   was really funny because it's such an easy hack to do what are those people doing horrible it's uh
[02:04:11.360 --> 02:04:15.680]   people love those samsung refrigerators because they've got those huge sort of
[02:04:15.680 --> 02:04:23.120]   sleek looking displays on the front but i i don't know when the last time samsung patched the
[02:04:23.760 --> 02:04:29.840]   firmware was it's been years enjoyed did you see uh the teenager whose mom took away her phone
[02:04:29.840 --> 02:04:40.000]   so she tweeted from the refrigerator no yeah she's an ariana grande fan known only as dorothy
[02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:45.840]   her mother it was it was if you're watching the tweets it slowly got worse and worse as mom got
[02:04:45.840 --> 02:04:51.520]   madder and madder took her so she took away the phone so she used her we actually first she used
[02:04:51.520 --> 02:04:59.600]   her and her portable nintendo then she had to go to their we you finally from the lg smart
[02:04:59.600 --> 02:05:05.600]   refrigerator and if and now the guardians casting doubt but i have to say if you look at the user
[02:05:05.600 --> 02:05:12.960]   agent on each of these tweets it actually says lg smart refrigerator so either she's really smart
[02:05:12.960 --> 02:05:19.040]   so sounds legit to me sounds legit to me nintendo ds she says my mom took my phone and my nintendo ds
[02:05:19.040 --> 02:05:22.560]   so i have no choice but to use my we apparently that's hard to do by the way
[02:05:22.560 --> 02:05:26.960]   finally she sent a tweet fridge that said i'm talking to my fridge
[02:05:26.960 --> 02:05:34.640]   just imagine her tweeting via her thermostat you know just like all the internet of things devices
[02:05:34.640 --> 02:05:41.680]   yeah this whole show has kind of real theme around workarounds and workarounds this is the
[02:05:41.680 --> 02:05:47.680]   workarounds show yeah i i sent somebody i don't know who's running the chat for me but i sent a link
[02:05:47.680 --> 02:05:52.400]   to this person i'm talking about who makes herself look like different people yeah with makeup if you

[02:07:00.640 --> 02:07:05.520]   instagram i just looked her up through the articles quicker but she like and i see other people doing
[02:07:05.520 --> 02:07:12.480]   like i've seen white women turn into black men but i'm like how did you do it and we hire her for
[02:07:12.480 --> 02:07:17.200]   this show as a makeup artist and then i could be a different celebrity every week you could be
[02:07:17.200 --> 02:07:22.080]   Walter white uncle leon shavier head against that will be amazing that'd be so oh my god
[02:07:22.080 --> 02:07:27.600]   i love the half and half one you could be half your younger so when i want to be me
[02:07:27.600 --> 02:07:32.240]   younger that's very nice to be a thank you the mean set on the white you would be distinguished
[02:07:32.240 --> 02:07:37.040]   so i could distinguish i could face this way and then if i want to be Walter white i face this way
[02:07:37.040 --> 02:07:47.360]   yeah that would be confusing as hell oh my creepy super super creepy uh okay let's take a break
[02:07:47.360 --> 02:07:52.880]   that teenage tweeting from the fridge took all this steam out of me i got a few more things we'll
[02:07:52.880 --> 02:07:58.400]   wrap this up soon Denise how so great to have you so great to be here plug something Denise howl.info
[02:07:58.400 --> 02:08:03.920]   your website @dhowl on twitter what are you up to besides triangulation anything else you want to
[02:08:03.920 --> 02:08:08.960]   talk about can i plug triangulation real quick please i have a couple of episodes coming up that
[02:08:08.960 --> 02:08:16.480]   are going to be really interesting one is with andrew aruda he's the founder of ross intelligence
[02:08:16.480 --> 02:08:25.120]   that's later this month ross intelligence is helping ai function in the legal arena so
[02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:31.440]   there's a lot of you know speculation about whether lawyers are going to be replaced by ai or
[02:08:31.440 --> 02:08:35.680]   you know how that all works so he's got a really interesting company and background i've talked
[02:08:35.680 --> 02:08:43.040]   with him before he's great and then also great coming up is uh joey edo director of the mit media
[02:08:43.040 --> 02:08:50.960]   lab i love joey oh he's so great week of september september yeah it's just uh if you want to go back

[02:09:05.040 --> 02:09:11.120]   in enacted so um good good complement to a lot of the things we talked about today there are so
[02:09:11.120 --> 02:09:18.400]   many thanks to you and mica and uh and jason howl and eventually i think we're going to get uh ant
[02:09:18.400 --> 02:09:21.360]   ant's nervous about doing triangulation but i think we've talked him into doing it
[02:09:21.360 --> 02:09:28.720]   this has become a much more uh diverse and interesting show because each of you brings your own style
[02:09:28.720 --> 02:09:34.160]   and uh expertise to it and guests so i'm really thrilled with what's happening to triangulation
[02:09:34.160 --> 02:09:39.360]   all the episodes yeah and what's our policy on repeat guests because i see matt cuts back at
[02:09:39.360 --> 02:09:44.720]   episode 53 and i'd love to get matt back on oh man by the way when i did that triangulation show i
[02:09:44.720 --> 02:09:50.160]   was in hawaii and the wi-fi was really wonky so i was like standing in a hotel room like trying to
[02:09:50.160 --> 02:09:56.880]   get a good connection episode 53 god 53 that was a long time ago we've had people on more than more
[02:09:56.880 --> 02:10:01.840]   we can we've had some people bought three or four times yep you can uh absolutely you want to get
[02:10:01.840 --> 02:10:08.400]   matt cuts matt meet Denise yes Denise matt we should get would you be willing to do it again of course
[02:10:08.400 --> 02:10:12.400]   oh we'd love to have you yeah there's lots yeah and this time it said talking about google you'd
[02:10:12.400 --> 02:10:15.600]   be talking about you at the United States social services now i'm really excited okay
[02:10:15.600 --> 02:10:22.000]   um and then my last plug is not for me it's for alice fagnola who's been on twill a couple of times
[02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:28.560]   and yeah she's so funny so wonderful she is uh doing a patreon right now where she's gonna do
[02:10:28.560 --> 02:10:36.560]   we were talking about toxicity on twitter she has written a song called their rubber your glue
[02:10:36.560 --> 02:10:43.760]   which is sending up yeah it's a great song and they're sending up it's it's taking actual things
[02:10:43.760 --> 02:10:52.000]   that have been tweeted at her and making them into lyrics and she says she wants to add fringe
[02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:59.600]   sequence a saxophone section and a kick line and really ramp this up so if you're up for that
[02:10:59.600 --> 02:11:03.760]   hit her up on patreon she's really talented that's a great idea it's kind of like the mean tweets
[02:11:03.760 --> 02:11:09.600]   segment uh that they do on a late night that's really great yes best way to diffuse this i think
[02:11:09.600 --> 02:11:15.120]   well actually the best way is just to ignore it but uh if you're not going to ignore it make fun of
[02:11:15.120 --> 02:11:22.560]   it people don't like being made fun of do they that cuts is also here if you are uh what are you
[02:11:22.560 --> 02:11:27.520]   looking for for the united states digital service who do you want so we would love to have folks who
[02:11:27.520 --> 02:11:35.040]   are designers engineers product managers we even need like a lawyer and recruiters in fact we
[02:11:35.040 --> 02:11:40.320]   sourced a recruiter from one of the times i was on the show oh so glad that's why you keep coming
[02:11:40.320 --> 02:11:46.640]   back i yeah i love you i love you Leo but also this is the right audience who often watches the show
[02:11:46.640 --> 02:11:51.520]   so for example we just launched something at the u.s digital service uh actually it's better
[02:11:51.520 --> 02:11:55.200]   described as a partnership with the center for medicare and medicaid services because they were
[02:11:55.200 --> 02:12:00.400]   doing the heavy work and we were assisting with it um but this idea of data at the point of care so
[02:12:00.400 --> 02:12:05.840]   imagine okay horrible scenario you get hit by a bus you're unconscious they rush you to the emergency
[02:12:05.840 --> 02:12:11.120]   room like it is not the case that they your doctors who are in the emergency room can tell what
[02:12:11.120 --> 02:12:16.800]   what treatments you've received so if you could set the standards such that you swipe the medicare
[02:12:16.800 --> 02:12:20.960]   card and you're able to pull up the medical claims that have happened you're like oh okay this person
[02:12:20.960 --> 02:12:26.080]   has diabetes uh this is when they had their last colonoscopy you know that's the kind of thing that
[02:12:26.080 --> 02:12:30.240]   is gonna save people's lives as someone who's about to be a medicare please get that written
[02:12:30.240 --> 02:12:34.560]   like and the now and by the way the system that pays out medicare written in koball
[02:12:34.560 --> 02:12:42.080]   oh my god yeah yeah 40 year old mainframe so like all we like we talked earlier in the show about
[02:12:42.080 --> 02:12:46.720]   a hundred thousand engineers at google and the difference one person can make by walking out like
[02:12:46.720 --> 02:12:51.520]   the number of people who are helping us out you know and partnering with the center for medicare
[02:12:51.520 --> 02:12:56.080]   and medicaid services you you know you can count them on two hands and a couple feet right you
[02:12:56.080 --> 02:13:01.600]   don't have to quit to do this no you can often go on a you know a leave of absence for six months
[02:13:01.600 --> 02:13:06.080]   google i know loves this idea it's very glad to support you and by the way michr soft allows it
[02:13:06.080 --> 02:13:11.200]   a bunch of companies allow it and uh and of course you have to make sure you're recused from anything
[02:13:11.200 --> 02:13:16.800]   that would affect that company but uh you know i started out you have to be a u.s citizen to do this
[02:13:16.800 --> 02:13:21.920]   you do have to be a u.s citizen uh but it's such a great program because the impact you can have
[02:13:21.920 --> 02:13:27.600]   is just off the charts u s d s dot gov slash apply uh if you want to know more go to u s d s dot gov
[02:13:27.600 --> 02:13:34.160]   there's a lot of information there but uh yeah i i think this is this is doing the work government
[02:13:34.160 --> 02:13:41.040]   should be doing which is to make it more accessible to its users it's the people right there's great
[02:13:41.040 --> 02:13:45.760]   government partners we're really just partnering with those civil servants and fun fact we just
[02:13:45.760 --> 02:13:49.520]   had our fifth birthday party so there's still time to get in on the ground floor of this this is
[02:13:49.520 --> 02:13:54.240]   still a brand new thing really great really really great uh always a pleasure having you here

[02:18:44.720 --> 02:18:53.440]   ah let's see i always like getting to the bottom of the show because that's when all that's when
[02:18:53.440 --> 02:18:58.960]   all the good stories shake the bottom one while way is back in the new this is just another crazy
[02:18:58.960 --> 02:19:04.240]   story while way you remember the way everybody said oh they're uh they're dangerous you don't
[02:19:04.240 --> 02:19:09.360]   use them and in fact there is a story in here that while way technicians have been helping
[02:19:09.360 --> 02:19:14.560]   governments in Uganda and Zambia spy and political opponents this is according to the Wall Street
[02:19:14.560 --> 02:19:21.120]   Journal but then but but by the way there's no evidence of Huawei or China even knew about
[02:19:21.120 --> 02:19:27.920]   Huawei employees doing this and it wasn't that anything about the Huawei technology was doing it
[02:19:27.920 --> 02:19:33.200]   it's just that the employees were doing it i think that's kind of par for the course when you're
[02:19:33.200 --> 02:19:38.880]   in a country you kind of have to do what the country wants you to do but what i'm confused about is
[02:19:38.880 --> 02:19:46.080]   we we said Huawei's bad don't use Huawei we banned Huawei and then three months ago
[02:19:46.080 --> 02:19:51.760]   we gave him another 90 days now we're giving him another 90 days which makes me think it has
[02:19:51.760 --> 02:19:56.960]   nothing to do with Huawei it has everything to do with the trade war either they are a security
[02:19:56.960 --> 02:20:03.680]   flaw or they're not a security hole or they're not if they're not then don't ban them if they are
[02:20:03.680 --> 02:20:13.520]   then do ban them but this uh give you another 90 days makes me nuts part of it is because of course
[02:20:13.520 --> 02:20:19.840]   if you ban Huawei from doing business with American companies it doesn't just hurt Huawei it hurts
[02:20:19.840 --> 02:20:25.680]   those American companies Huawei spends a significant amount of money with Google among others right
[02:20:25.680 --> 02:20:33.840]   they do Android phones they buy a lot of gear of 70 billion dollars Huawei spent buying
[02:20:33.840 --> 02:20:39.760]   components last year 11 billion dollars went to us firms 11 billion Qualcomm Intel and Micron
[02:20:39.760 --> 02:20:52.400]   among others there's nothing to say here it's just extremely confusing yeah and it really looks
[02:20:52.400 --> 02:20:56.240]   political it doesn't look like it has anything to do with technology or security
[02:20:56.240 --> 02:21:01.600]   okay because they're super close to building their own OS now right they are and the interesting
[02:21:01.600 --> 02:21:07.040]   thing is that Huawei sales are up in China dramatically because people are patriotic and they're
[02:21:07.040 --> 02:21:11.600]   saying well if you can't buy it in the US well we'll buy it here so they're doing quite well thank you
[02:21:11.600 --> 02:21:18.080]   they were the number two phone manufacturer worldwide it was Samsung Huawei and Apple
[02:21:19.440 --> 02:21:24.720]   I don't know where they stand right now that's why I'm gonna build my own phone out of a raspberry
[02:21:24.720 --> 02:21:30.080]   pie and I wish we could don't you wish it could just a homebrew you maybe you could
[02:21:30.080 --> 02:21:34.320]   now with Skype or you know some sort of wipe solution yeah I bet you could
[02:21:34.320 --> 02:21:39.040]   raspberry pie might be a little bulky a little bulky no remember remember keep that in mind Matt
[02:21:39.040 --> 02:21:44.800]   I got I got something free to end the show dad you brought that up I got some where's my uh
[02:21:44.800 --> 02:21:52.160]   where's my pocket operator I've lost it so I had I bought from a Swedish company called
[02:21:52.160 --> 02:21:57.760]   teenage engineering huh I bought it's the size of a um calculate looks in effect looks like a
[02:21:57.760 --> 02:22:02.560]   calculator just got a calculator and it's a synthesizer it's called a pocket operator it was 59 bucks
[02:22:02.560 --> 02:22:08.080]   and you're hanging around your neck if they can make a synthesizer they could make a phone oh yeah
[02:22:08.080 --> 02:22:12.560]   oh yeah they use some weird chip like it was designed for something completely different they
[02:22:12.560 --> 02:22:19.360]   said well it's cheap there it is look at that make a synthesizer the size of a calculator yeah it's
[02:22:19.360 --> 02:22:26.000]   the coolest thing except I lost those old brick phones or do for a comeback there's such a movement
[02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:32.080]   toward retro old things how do you post to instagram with a brick phone though that's that's why you're
[02:22:32.080 --> 02:22:37.680]   more productive you could fit a lot of stuff inside that case true you could get pretty super
[02:22:38.880 --> 02:22:44.320]   meta you post a picture of the brick phone from a phone here it is the here it is the pie phone
[02:22:44.320 --> 02:22:50.320]   iPhone oh that's a little bulky it's a little bulky you know what it encourages you to get some
[02:22:50.320 --> 02:22:56.160]   reps a little bit of muscle building it's got a little hat that can do the radio so it's actually
[02:22:56.160 --> 02:23:03.360]   a phone it's not just VoIP it's a wow yeah this is America lea we could do anything yeah you can
[02:23:03.360 --> 02:23:09.200]   probably give me a British made raspberry pie and I could do anything anything anything
[02:23:09.200 --> 02:23:18.560]   a judge has ordered the state of Georgia to switch to paper ballots for 2020 maybe we could
[02:23:18.560 --> 02:23:23.920]   just do this country-wide nationwide we've distilled I can't believe the number of election
[02:23:23.920 --> 02:23:29.280]   machines that are connected to the public internet it's kind of what Defcon is all about now right
[02:23:29.280 --> 02:23:35.760]   right hack the voting machine voting machine village yeah I'm glad that this judge realized
[02:23:35.760 --> 02:23:41.680]   the point of paper ballots you can audit them we need you need a paper trail literally
[02:23:41.680 --> 02:23:49.200]   quite literally the FTC says I'm willing to break up big tech great good thank you appreciate the
[02:23:49.200 --> 02:23:56.720]   chairman Joe Simons is leading a broad review of the technology sector he said in an interview
[02:23:56.720 --> 02:24:03.760]   with Bloomberg there's Emily Chang breaking up a company's hard but we could do it if you have to
[02:24:03.760 --> 02:24:10.880]   you do it it's not ideal it's very messy but if you have to you do it how old is this guy oh no
[02:24:10.880 --> 02:24:23.360]   that's Kurt Wagner oh good oh my god he's 20 okay whoa okay and that's why it's Instagram by Facebook
[02:24:23.360 --> 02:24:28.240]   yeah it's you know what we were talking about that two weeks ago why would it why would Facebook
[02:24:28.240 --> 02:24:32.720]   do that with Instagram and WhatsApp because the whole strength of Instagram WhatsApp is a lot of
[02:24:32.720 --> 02:24:37.040]   people don't know it's Facebook they rebranded Instagram by Facebook and WhatsApp by Facebook
[02:24:37.040 --> 02:24:41.520]   and you just nailed it oh doctor you know in one sentence it's harder to break up and also and
[02:24:41.520 --> 02:24:46.640]   also to the point it's what all corporations do it's you know when I buy a Toyota it's a Toyota
[02:24:46.640 --> 02:24:51.600]   Camry I just know that Toyota is the brand and the foundation of that company if Facebook was the
[02:24:51.600 --> 02:24:56.400]   stronger brand it would make even more sense but this is what all strong mega-corpse do they have
[02:24:56.400 --> 02:25:01.120]   their flagship and then they have subsidiaries that are known with that and associate with to build
[02:25:01.120 --> 02:25:05.920]   up the regular brand recognition it's just a car dealership move and I should fully understand
[02:25:05.920 --> 02:25:11.040]   how they did it this is super late they're way late on this rebranded thing because now
[02:25:11.040 --> 02:25:15.280]   Facebook's a dumpster fire I don't know why that's the leading title but I understand why they did it
[02:25:15.280 --> 02:25:22.800]   yeah I'm not worried about the ones that that are you know just big in their field but there are
[02:25:22.800 --> 02:25:29.040]   competitors I if I were Amazon I'd be more worried about this especially because of you know stories
[02:25:29.040 --> 02:25:34.400]   that come out about its practices where its products are competing with its third party vendor
[02:25:34.400 --> 02:25:40.480]   products and what it does for pricing and that one I think is a little bit more your classic
[02:25:40.480 --> 02:25:47.280]   antitrust case IKEA is going all in on smart home tech you're ready I see I
[02:25:47.280 --> 02:25:54.800]   I don't want to assemble my Amazon Echo from a pamphlet with no words there's always going to be
[02:25:54.800 --> 02:26:00.720]   an extra speaker when you get done leftover you know it's going to happen it's no it's going to
[02:26:00.720 --> 02:26:06.560]   happen so they IKEA actually I did I really would like this except I don't want an IKEA table but
[02:26:06.560 --> 02:26:13.360]   they put cheap charging in their tables a while ago your coffee tables or side tables then they
[02:26:13.360 --> 02:26:19.680]   added smart lighting they've partnered with Sonos for a launch of this month of Whole Harm Audio
[02:26:19.680 --> 02:26:25.200]   fairly inexpensive smart blinds start sale on October 1st apparently according to the Verge
[02:26:25.200 --> 02:26:33.360]   IKEA is building a whole business unit called helmed by Bjorn Block
[02:26:36.080 --> 02:26:43.760]   Bjorn Flatpack is the guy running this and no it lighting living room in workspace
[02:26:43.760 --> 02:26:50.000]   textiles kitchen and dining and IKEA food will be joined by now IKEA home smart
[02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:54.320]   as we laugh about this in three years they're going to be killing it in this market sure
[02:26:54.320 --> 02:27:01.440]   sure the same way Amazon tries to put a clock with it in it this is much more feasible for
[02:27:01.440 --> 02:27:05.680]   people to actually going to physically pick up and buy furniture and if I could buy the things
[02:27:05.680 --> 02:27:09.760]   that are smart into it IKEA is going to kill it besides the extra speaker thing because I mean
[02:27:09.760 --> 02:27:14.720]   they do always have extra pieces I don't know why but it's not even a meme anymore it's reality
[02:27:14.720 --> 02:27:21.760]   of life when you buy something from IKEA but a lot of people do and a lot of people will buy this
[02:27:21.760 --> 02:27:27.200]   right so let's just hope they're patching everything make it secure make it updateable over the
[02:27:27.200 --> 02:27:32.880]   over the air right that's good luck with that whether that's happening good luck
[02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:40.640]   guys you guys watch mr robot when it was on oh yeah yes remember the season two premiere
[02:27:40.640 --> 02:27:45.920]   but you know had all kinds of plot twists and stuff but my favorite part of it is evil corpse
[02:27:45.920 --> 02:27:53.680]   lawyers home got completely pwned of course yeah yep and then they took it over and they
[02:27:53.680 --> 02:27:57.440]   just really stunned to learn that the star of that was Freddie mercury I didn't realize Freddie
[02:27:57.440 --> 02:28:03.840]   was such a dream he really had range yeah it's really cool yeah uh FT oh I mean I said
[02:28:03.840 --> 02:28:08.880]   the ft cethlin let's see women I have a I have a couple more oh I wish I you know I thought of this
[02:28:08.880 --> 02:28:12.560]   I had thought of this before I brought my Tesla back I don't have a Tesla anymore
[02:28:12.560 --> 02:28:19.360]   a Tesla owner implanted the RFID chip from her model three's key card into her arm so she could
[02:28:19.360 --> 02:28:26.400]   just get into her car and drive off yeah what a great idea yeah better well hopefully no one
[02:28:26.400 --> 02:28:31.600]   docks her and cuts off her arm and takes her car I mean why would you okay but that's going a
[02:28:31.600 --> 02:28:38.800]   little far okay but they just had people's faces in your body like literally your faces in fingerprints
[02:28:38.800 --> 02:28:45.040]   leak and that was a million consumers so like RFID tag like no big one so it's just like having
[02:28:45.040 --> 02:28:49.120]   your keys but I just know why you put extra stuff in your body in a world where people were getting
[02:28:49.120 --> 02:28:54.240]   cancers and all kinds of tumors and things like that like I understand the biometrics of things
[02:28:54.240 --> 02:28:58.160]   because people are actually doing that they're putting things in there but I just I don't get it
[02:28:58.160 --> 02:29:02.960]   for your car that's not something I want to go put in my body for I have to admit I this is one where
[02:29:02.960 --> 02:29:08.800]   I would I do not have a tattoo I don't plan on getting any tattoos but I would totally implant
[02:29:08.800 --> 02:29:13.920]   one of those suckers right in my thumb if I could get into my house cool and you had your PGP key on
[02:29:13.920 --> 02:29:20.240]   yeah you bekey you know you single touch is just built in I mean so her name is just where Apple
[02:29:20.240 --> 02:29:25.520]   watch like I got well and Apple watch you do you can lose your watch you can lose your PD she
[02:29:25.520 --> 02:29:32.240]   dissolved so you get a card you get a card key she dissolved the card using acetone had the chip
[02:29:32.240 --> 02:29:38.160]   encased in a biopolymer so it wouldn't react so safe then she goes to a guy who apparently has
[02:29:38.160 --> 02:29:44.640]   permanent juggalo face paint had a body modification studio and had the chip which is about the size
[02:29:44.640 --> 02:29:52.400]   of a Lego mini figure oh my god it's big it planted into her forearm oh yeah you can you could follow
[02:29:52.400 --> 02:29:58.880]   it on hackaday I'm not following that we're just talking about thermostats getting pwned
[02:29:58.880 --> 02:30:06.720]   I know just don't okay it is a little large it is a little large it's too big I thought it would
[02:30:06.720 --> 02:30:12.080]   be like a little right size of a grain of rice yeah that's fine yeah but not like they could do
[02:30:12.080 --> 02:30:16.480]   that with it like they're someone just whoa brother yeah Matt your thumb would look really
[02:30:16.480 --> 02:30:25.920]   swole yeah I'm gonna get that car right no problem okay having seen now the size of it
[02:30:25.920 --> 02:30:32.640]   okay I'll wait for the next generation I'm bummed you know google decided this has been a kind of
[02:30:32.640 --> 02:30:39.120]   workaround for a while if you had incognito mode you could go to the New York Times and other sites
[02:30:39.120 --> 02:30:43.600]   using incognito mode it wouldn't know you'd been there then the New York Times figured it out and
[02:30:43.600 --> 02:30:50.320]   it turns out that if you're in incognito mode it will tell the site you're going to he's in incognito
[02:30:50.320 --> 02:30:55.280]   mode so the Times started saying you're incognito mode you can't read anything on the New York Times
[02:30:55.280 --> 02:31:02.480]   so then in the most recent version of chrome they announced that they were stopped doing that
[02:31:02.480 --> 02:31:09.440]   so that the New York Times all of a sudden this work around worked again and now it turns out
[02:31:09.440 --> 02:31:14.240]   that this more private incognito mode doesn't do it anymore web developers have two new tricks to
[02:31:14.240 --> 02:31:22.320]   get around it and now you can't go to the New York Times anymore oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
[02:31:22.320 --> 02:31:28.960]   oh yeah I didn't think that does that work I guess it would yeah well I wouldn't it why wouldn't
[02:31:28.960 --> 02:31:36.320]   it because the way they're doing it by a cookie right right yeah okay I pay for the New York Times
[02:31:36.320 --> 02:31:40.240]   subscribe yes that is also an I do subscribe I'm sorry I'm sorry yes you should we should pay
[02:31:40.240 --> 02:31:46.400]   subscribe thing I happily pay I get I mean it's getting less happy I paid for the New York Times
[02:31:46.400 --> 02:31:53.440]   then I paid for the washington post then I paid for wired and Bloomberg said oh that'll be 35 bucks
[02:31:53.440 --> 02:32:00.320]   a month oh paid for that I was about to say Uncle Leo can I get one of them can I get the
[02:32:00.320 --> 02:32:05.120]   logins I'll pay for one of them if you give me the logins to all six I'll take I'll take the five
[02:32:05.120 --> 02:32:11.440]   out that's a good way to have a co-op oh I don't pay for my net flip like I only pay for Hulu
[02:32:11.440 --> 02:32:16.000]   and I have every service available because we are in a co-op where one person pays for one and
[02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:21.440]   one person patient I have access to Comcast probably the guy that sells those fire TV sticks
[02:32:21.440 --> 02:32:26.800]   at your girl's softball game hey he's not a bright guy but he's making money you know what I'm saying
[02:32:26.800 --> 02:32:34.480]   so get out this is a callback to an earlier episode I got HBO Cinemax show I got all of them but
[02:32:34.480 --> 02:32:38.400]   I ain't got none of them you feel me all I got is Hulu that's all I'm saying that's all I got
[02:32:38.400 --> 02:32:43.680]   that's because you're sticking it to the man do you have a man trying to stick it to me if I
[02:32:43.680 --> 02:32:47.360]   bought all those I would be broke Uncle Leo it's just reciprocal stick ain't gonna buy
[02:32:47.360 --> 02:32:52.080]   himself you know I'm saying it's sharing his caring so I will just say if you're a government
[02:32:52.080 --> 02:32:56.320]   employee you can get a free subscription to the washington post oh might sign me up but we'll
[02:32:56.320 --> 02:33:00.400]   put my application and you do so me Matt don't say that on lab president Trump gonna shut that
[02:33:00.400 --> 02:33:05.600]   down right away saying gonna shut that down right away what's this budget line for washington
[02:33:05.600 --> 02:33:11.360]   post here what's this some members of the military really that's interesting yep
[02:33:11.360 --> 02:33:17.520]   free subscription that makes sense sure is that the post doing that yeah oh nice doesn't cost
[02:33:17.520 --> 02:33:22.160]   you oh yeah no it's not the government doesn't pay no no no that's that's just Jeff Bezos out of
[02:33:22.160 --> 02:33:27.520]   the goodness of his heart washington post the company not the not the government not the government
[02:33:27.520 --> 02:33:36.240]   Disney and charter out to get you oh doctor oh what are they doing what are they up to oh I'm already
[02:33:36.240 --> 02:33:40.960]   worked on does I already got it figured out what about this HBO Max you're gonna pay for that
[02:33:40.960 --> 02:33:48.080]   I got HP I don't need to max regular HBO go works just by brother um so what's what are
[02:33:48.080 --> 02:33:54.800]   charter in Disney doing Denise let's see John Brodkin has an article at ours Technica talking
[02:33:54.800 --> 02:34:01.200]   about how they're trying to fight account sharing keeping multiple people from using a single account
[02:34:01.200 --> 02:34:09.840]   to access services technically I'm not real clear what they're doing but they are they are trying
[02:34:09.840 --> 02:34:16.640]   to get that out yeah I love Disney writing a face to say you think you can stop me good love
[02:34:16.640 --> 02:34:23.520]   Disney he does point out you can use a VPN to avoid detection well all they have to do
[02:34:24.240 --> 02:34:30.560]   honestly is say we associate an IP address with your account and you better come in from that
[02:34:30.560 --> 02:34:38.000]   IP address or you can't use it and the VPN working yeah that doesn't work with with ISBNs that that
[02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:45.360]   changer your ISP is to change that's right not very often I've noticed but yeah that's a good
[02:34:45.360 --> 02:34:50.240]   point you can't do it by IP address okay oh I know what you do you get everybody you give
[02:34:50.240 --> 02:34:56.640]   everybody kasperski antivirus oh not recommended by the way not recommend well here's another
[02:34:56.640 --> 02:35:02.800]   reason not to recommend it uh so if you use kasperski antivirus the famed Russian
[02:35:02.800 --> 02:35:12.000]   antivirus uh used by the uh Russian secret police and many more uh one of the things it does now
[02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:16.720]   and by the way uh jean kasperski who's be loved by for some reason by tech writers I think he
[02:35:16.720 --> 02:35:21.360]   must throw a great party has said again and again we don't work for the Russians I don't like the
[02:35:21.360 --> 02:35:26.960]   I am Russian and it's a Russian company but the what is it the GRU it doesn't have anything to do
[02:35:26.960 --> 02:35:36.160]   with what I do uh but there is a little JavaScript that kasperski will embed in every webpage you
[02:35:36.160 --> 02:35:46.400]   go to giving a unique identifier putting actually putting the unique identifier in the URL oh dear
[02:35:46.720 --> 02:35:54.240]   so um this comes from hyza.de which is a great magazine computer technology magazine they discovered
[02:35:54.240 --> 02:36:05.040]   this um this uh main.js is loaded every single time you go to a website it's loaded from a kasperski
[02:36:05.040 --> 02:36:14.960]   domain uh and in every browser firefox edge and opera same line of code chrome every single browser
[02:36:14.960 --> 02:36:22.400]   has a unique id that it uh gives you assigns you and of course that id is readable by every site you
[02:36:22.400 --> 02:36:28.960]   go to which means those sites could track you kasperski you can track you and when told about
[02:36:28.960 --> 02:36:38.240]   this kasperski said oops it was apparently introduced in 2015 um kasperski says oh this would be too
[02:36:38.240 --> 02:36:44.720]   complex and not profitable for cyber criminals to use well maybe not so they turn it off they
[02:36:44.720 --> 02:36:50.480]   gave everybody the same id but you but it's still an announcement to every site you visit that
[02:36:50.480 --> 02:36:56.800]   you're using kasperski which basically is a security problem all on its own yeah so if you are using
[02:36:56.800 --> 02:37:00.800]   kasperski for reasons I don't understand you don't really need it but if you are using it
[02:37:00.800 --> 02:37:08.080]   click the uh settings icon in the bottom left click additional network click go to traffic
[02:37:08.080 --> 02:37:15.520]   processing and uncheck inject script into web traffic that apparently is an option it's a setting
[02:37:15.520 --> 02:37:22.720]   and it's on by default that's kind of a red flag inject script into web traffic you can turn that
[02:37:22.720 --> 02:37:29.360]   off globally available to all yeah security option yeah inject script into web traffic
[02:37:29.360 --> 02:37:34.960]   it's innocuous what do you say well it doesn't sound so bad what could possibly go wrong
[02:37:35.680 --> 02:37:40.880]   in tracking meanwhile I have to praise apple they're they're going to change how web kit works there
[02:37:40.880 --> 02:37:47.280]   apple is decided and actually web kit is strictly apple any more than chromium is strictly google
[02:37:47.280 --> 02:37:52.400]   but apple is you know kind of supporting the web kit project all the apple browsers including
[02:37:52.400 --> 02:37:59.920]   safari that's the apple browser run on it um apple has web kit has said we are going to interpret
[02:38:01.040 --> 02:38:06.480]   any we're going to do our best to prevent all covert tracking all cross-site tracking even
[02:38:06.480 --> 02:38:13.600]   when it's not covert and when we discover additional tracking techniques we're going to block them
[02:38:13.600 --> 02:38:19.360]   we are going to treat tracking we treat circumvention of shipping anti-tracking measures with the same
[02:38:19.360 --> 02:38:25.200]   seriousness as exploitation of security vulnerabilities if a party attempts to circumvent our tracking
[02:38:25.200 --> 02:38:29.600]   protection methods we will add additional restrictions without prior notice these restrictions may
[02:38:29.600 --> 02:38:34.800]   apply universally to algorithm clean classified targets or even to specific parties engage
[02:38:34.800 --> 02:38:39.200]   in circumvention this is the policy you want they're basically saying if somebody tries to get
[02:38:39.200 --> 02:38:43.120]   around circumvent our anti-tracking technologies we're going to treat that as malware and we're
[02:38:43.120 --> 02:38:48.960]   going to block it okay so here's a hot take it feels like we talked earlier in the show about how
[02:38:48.960 --> 02:38:54.080]   some recordings of syria people were transcribing or stuff like that but this is actually going to
[02:38:54.080 --> 02:39:00.240]   have much more impact than that other which is a small real privacy yeah and so i have always been
[02:39:00.240 --> 02:39:05.440]   in the last few months i've been wondering why we don't see more companies genuinely dedicated
[02:39:05.440 --> 02:39:10.720]   to putting security first maybe privacy right after that and it feels like with all the stuff
[02:39:10.720 --> 02:39:15.680]   we're seeing where windows 10 is wormable right now unless you patch there's room for that like
[02:39:15.680 --> 02:39:20.480]   there's room for companies that are rebuilding the customer experience with security first and
[02:39:20.480 --> 02:39:26.320]   foremost like usability customer experience security and and this is an interesting step in that
[02:39:26.320 --> 02:39:32.400]   direction and you know it's against this a little group called the iab the internet advertising
[02:39:32.400 --> 02:39:37.360]   europe of course they are but if you were rebuilding the internet from scratch you probably in this
[02:39:37.360 --> 02:39:43.840]   day and age wouldn't make it so that the internet was so trackable yeah so yeah so you know re-architecting
[02:39:43.840 --> 02:39:48.320]   stuff and changing the pillar of what has historically been the compact you maybe pay for
[02:39:48.320 --> 02:39:53.120]   consumption of your media via tracking or ads or something like you know at least don't get the
[02:39:53.120 --> 02:39:57.120]   tracking part you still get to show the ads i should point out that firefoxes does this as well
[02:39:57.120 --> 02:40:04.560]   and has been for some time they're effectively copying what firefox does the iab will undoubtedly
[02:40:04.560 --> 02:40:09.360]   not like this either they basically represent the ad tech industry one of the reasons it's a hot
[02:40:09.360 --> 02:40:15.840]   button for me is the iab also affects podcasting and i'm afraid where i was just back from the
[02:40:15.840 --> 02:40:20.800]   podcast movement which is the big podcast expo was in our land of this week uh six thousand
[02:40:20.800 --> 02:40:27.680]   podcasters and a lot of iab representatives ad tech is very interested in podcasting we do not
[02:40:27.680 --> 02:40:33.680]   do tracking we get requests all the time for all sorts of little trackers that we could somehow
[02:40:33.680 --> 02:40:38.720]   magically put in the you know sounds in the podcast that you wouldn't hear things like that we of
[02:40:38.720 --> 02:40:44.400]   course always refuse because i know you wouldn't want us to do that but the iab has now created a
[02:40:44.400 --> 02:40:49.600]   measurement system which is rapidly being adopted a measurement system that favors
[02:40:49.600 --> 02:40:54.800]   advertisers and i'm sorry to say i don't consider fair to podcasters this is going to be a big
[02:40:54.800 --> 02:41:04.480]   battle except i think we are lost but i'm gonna fight it anyway so yeah i you know of course as
[02:41:04.480 --> 02:41:08.800]   soon as there's money in something and podcasting is happening right it's a hot and happening thing
[02:41:08.800 --> 02:41:15.200]   along come ad tech folks who want to introduce ad tech and right now there's no ad tech in
[02:41:15.200 --> 02:41:20.640]   podcasting but advertisers say well there has to be or we won't buy ads fortunately aren't thank
[02:41:20.640 --> 02:41:26.000]   you to our advertisers who are all here because they're willing not to do that and we think that's
[02:41:26.000 --> 02:41:32.560]   really important so pay attention when you hear about iab and the new iab 2.0 measurement guidelines
[02:41:34.320 --> 02:41:40.880]   be afraid be very afraid very afraid a lot i'm sad to say a lot of podcast companies are now
[02:41:40.880 --> 02:41:46.240]   members of the iab which is a very expensive membership i think it's ten thousand dollars and
[02:41:46.240 --> 02:41:52.880]   a percentage of your revenue what so well the whole idea is i don't think they want broadcasters
[02:41:52.880 --> 02:41:56.720]   and podcasters to be involved they want advertisers to be involved so yeah they don't want us to have
[02:41:56.720 --> 02:42:03.760]   a voice that's the last thing they want i got a few fights with some other podcast companies about
[02:42:03.760 --> 02:42:10.000]   that one all week long we're kind of debating that one uh but that's inside baseball there's no room
[02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:15.200]   for that in this fine show there is room though for oh doc to love having o and jj stone on
[02:42:15.200 --> 02:42:20.000]   at me last i got to talk about some oh he's got something to plug oh yeah you know we really
[02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:26.400]   can't end the show properly when on with that on o and ran that's right so we're gonna we're gonna
[02:42:26.400 --> 02:42:32.160]   okay you're right forget i mentioned you yes i don't exist he's not on the show you know who is
[02:42:32.160 --> 02:42:37.840]   though to nise how the wonderful the nise howl danish howl dot info at d howl on twitter i miss
[02:42:37.840 --> 02:42:42.160]   you i'm so glad that you're doing taking triangulation by the horns and we're gonna i love having you on
[02:42:42.160 --> 02:42:45.920]   twitter we've got to have you on as often as possible thank you for being here thank you it was so fun
[02:42:45.920 --> 02:42:49.840]   being with you all today and leo i was just sitting here thinking how different it must have been for
[02:42:49.840 --> 02:42:54.400]   you to go to that show this week and the one where you and i first met in person that was put in
[02:42:54.400 --> 02:42:59.360]   on terry o california i don't know how many years ago yes must have been such a different scene more
[02:42:59.360 --> 02:43:02.800]   than ten years ago i think it was twenty two thousand seven maybe two thousand eight
[02:43:02.800 --> 02:43:08.480]   and uh it is really exciting i'm really excited about all the new podcasters
[02:43:08.480 --> 02:43:13.440]   all the people getting excited but you're also seeing big companies big brands moving in
[02:43:13.440 --> 02:43:19.920]   uh and you're seeing a lot of pressure from uh advertisers and big podcasting companies
[02:43:19.920 --> 02:43:25.520]   to to change the way podcasting works and i would i really love about podcasting is
[02:43:26.240 --> 02:43:32.640]   how we're just kind of you know doing our thing without ad tech and ad tech ruin blogs i don't
[02:43:32.640 --> 02:43:38.320]   want to add tech to ruin podcasting so uh and one of the things it did was blogging is it it really
[02:43:38.320 --> 02:43:44.560]   it really eliminated the middle ground you're either a big brand or you're not trying to make
[02:43:44.560 --> 02:43:50.400]   any money you're just a personal blogger and right now there's room in podcasting for companies
[02:43:50.400 --> 02:43:54.960]   like twit a lot of independent companies to do what we do and to make a living doing it i fear
[02:43:54.960 --> 02:44:02.240]   the same thing will happen that will be squeezed out it'll either be npr and you know cbs and nbc
[02:44:02.240 --> 02:44:06.320]   or somebody who doesn't who just wants to do a little hobbyist podcast i guess we could do a
[02:44:06.320 --> 02:44:10.240]   hobbyist podcast i'd have to get a real job though i don't want to do that i have to work
[02:44:10.240 --> 02:44:17.680]   the hands off the film and center or something uh i can't hold it for half an hour forget it and

[02:45:33.040 --> 02:45:39.200]   gonna be sorry i was wrong i we call we call it the netcast and my staff has been pointing out to
[02:45:39.200 --> 02:45:45.920]   me for a few years that really hurts searchability because nobody's searching for netcasts i lost
[02:45:45.920 --> 02:45:51.040]   that battle so i'm sorry but be prepared we're gonna change all the verb age including the net
[02:45:51.040 --> 02:45:56.800]   cast you love from people you trust the beginning to podcasts i'm gonna give up but uh so that is
[02:45:56.800 --> 02:46:04.160]   one big change for us anyway we admit to being a podcast blue ray one blue ray one that's us we were
[02:46:04.160 --> 02:46:10.560]   we were the the what the beta cam s beta s beta deck whatever what beta
[02:46:10.560 --> 02:46:21.040]   beta hd dvds of the internet we give in i give in i give up so it is a podcast which you can
[02:46:21.040 --> 02:46:26.800]   download by going to twit.tv all of our shows are there or subscribe i have to say the word podcast
[02:46:26.800 --> 02:46:32.080]   makes even less sense if you can get us on youtube if you're watching on youtube press the subscribe

[02:46:41.840 --> 02:46:48.000]   is it's an echo cast i don't know what that right is that a chacha in irc is pointing out that
[02:46:48.000 --> 02:46:53.680]   that podcast the word has pretty much outlived the ipod which has the podcast
[02:46:53.680 --> 02:47:00.480]   ipod's pretty much gone nobody listens to podcast on ipod's is it an i-phone cast no it's just a it's

[02:47:31.920 --> 02:47:39.440]   so normally people in a chat or afterwards always ask why i'm one here was my expertise i don't
[02:47:39.440 --> 02:47:43.840]   plug myself if you want to find out what i do for money go to link den or something don't worry
[02:47:43.840 --> 02:47:49.600]   about why i'm here but i'm here to tell you a story last week i was going to the grocery store and
[02:47:49.600 --> 02:47:55.520]   there was an older lady who was struggling to get her water and dog food in her car i walked over i
[02:47:55.520 --> 02:48:01.440]   offered her help she started crying and she said oh thank you so much so i helped her put the stuff
[02:48:01.440 --> 02:48:07.440]   in her car and she just said you know nobody wants to help anybody anymore this is a digital world i
[02:48:07.440 --> 02:48:13.600]   don't know how to live in it my husband passed away two months ago my my mother i'm putting her in a
[02:48:13.600 --> 02:48:18.640]   home because she broke down after my husband passed away and my two kids live far away i still have
[02:48:18.640 --> 02:48:24.960]   a regular phone and i'm just so lonely and nobody will talk to me and so i took her across the street
[02:48:24.960 --> 02:48:29.040]   and we had lunch where we had smoothies and i talked her for like an hour and a half and she
[02:48:29.040 --> 02:48:32.640]   explained that she just didn't know how to work technology she was like maybe i can go take a class
[02:48:32.640 --> 02:48:38.080]   or something like that because she just wants to be able to do the video thing with her kids so i
[02:48:38.080 --> 02:48:44.320]   happen to have um that facebook portal i never use it so i set that up for her at her house and now
[02:48:44.320 --> 02:48:51.200]   she can call her kids i say this because everybody listening has somebody in her family that they're
[02:48:51.200 --> 02:48:56.640]   ignoring that is older that we have the technology to talk to them and they're lonely and they miss
[02:48:56.640 --> 02:49:01.360]   you and as much as you're tweeting and texting and you think that texting is the way pick up a phone
[02:49:01.360 --> 02:49:07.440]   and call them and so since uh to encourage this uncle leo has always been generous and nice to me
[02:49:07.440 --> 02:49:14.880]   he always gives me gadgets i have an extra portal that i'm gonna give to someone if you live in the
[02:49:14.880 --> 02:49:20.640]   u.s uh fit lower 50 states send me an email you can find me on the internet send me an email tell me
[02:49:20.640 --> 02:49:25.920]   of someone that's older in your family that needs some technology and i will send it to one person
[02:49:25.920 --> 02:49:31.680]   for free wow secondly it makes me feel guilty because i had two portals and i just gave them to birk
[02:49:31.680 --> 02:49:37.840]   yeah i think birk probably gave them to a i hope birk is what did you do with them birk did you take
[02:49:37.840 --> 02:49:44.160]   them apart the only thing you can do with the facebook portal you need to like exercise it i
[02:49:44.160 --> 02:49:49.040]   should have thought i'd part but that's nice that you would talk to thank you and then secondly um
[02:49:49.040 --> 02:49:54.400]   we talked about it earlier for anybody who has kids or wants to make a cell phone i have five
[02:49:54.400 --> 02:49:59.760]   raspberry pie piece i will pick five people and send them to you again for free if you're in the
[02:49:59.760 --> 02:50:04.720]   u.s if you have a kid you want to tinker and make something or if you want to go try and make your
[02:50:04.720 --> 02:50:08.880]   own cell phone just write me an email tell me why you want to do something with your kid and i will
[02:50:08.880 --> 02:50:15.120]   send five of these out to five people because you're a avid listener and you deserve something special
[02:50:15.120 --> 02:50:20.400]   and i have it to give but just remember call somebody that's older tell them you love them take time
[02:50:20.400 --> 02:50:25.680]   to get out of your own bubble and hug somebody love somebody because it's not all it's about to
