[00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.700]   Hello Dvorak.com slash blog
[00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.540]   No agenda show.com no agenda show.com
[00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.460]   Go, Kentucky
[00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:42.980]   Undefeated yes undefeated but a little later on we have no local teams that can win anything so I have to go
[00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.680]   Now did somebody from Kentucky send you this? Yes. Yes. I'm hoping to get another you know Ryan shroud
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.680]   Who's our host at this weekend computer?
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.900]   Hardware is a big Kentucky fan. He's from that area. How tall is he? I don't know. He's huge
[00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.780]   also with us Clayton Morris all the way from
[00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.200]   New York are you in are you like Tinky Wig or you?
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:08.220]   No in New Jersey, New Jersey better and and like John I thought about maybe wearing a
[00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:14.840]   College my University of Pittsburgh hoodie today, but since they're pretty terrible I opted instead to
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.620]   University of California gear
[00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.860]   You see Clayton every weekend on Fox and Friends, and he's also kind of the resident geek
[00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:27.860]   It's only a matter of time before you become like the the tech guy. I mean you are aren't you yet at Fox
[00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:33.500]   Yeah, I think I would like safe to say that I'm the guy that does the most tech at at Fox News Channel
[00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:38.140]   So yeah, yeah before before I got there. No one was doing it so well. What's good thing
[00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.140]   Do they know anything about tech those people?
[00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.820]   Anything a dirt there's a his Megyn Kelly know how to boot a machine
[00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:52.580]   You know you got Neil Cavuto who's very plugged in he's he's got he's got all kinds of tablets in front of him
[00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:55.060]   He's a he's a big fan. So he's a big fan of technology
[00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.060]   Has that giant iPads?
[00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:04.900]   Those giant they're the 50-foot iPad. Yeah, they're amazing. Yeah, either that are very small staffers
[00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.060]   They're shrunken down. It's incredible given a tour to my brother. My brother had never been to New York City
[00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.060]   He came to town yesterday. He
[00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.740]   Navy veteran and he was in town
[00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:16.180]   He was near at Fort Dix down there in New Jersey
[00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.500]   And I gave him a tour of the studio yesterday and we went into the studio
[00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:24.340]   It's all quiet on the weekend. You get to see Shepherd Smith studio and say whoa so huge in here
[00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:30.660]   No, it just looks huge. Yeah on television also Dwight Silverman from the Houston Chronicle
[00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:36.900]   Blog cron.com slash tech blog. Are you still doing the tech blog? I am still doing the tech blog
[00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.920]   I don't get to it as often as I would like but I'm making more of an effort you better
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.920]   I'm still doing it and Clayton
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:48.980]   You will know what you have arrived as the tech guy at Fox when everybody starts coming to you when it's time to buy
[00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:51.900]   A new iPhone and says should I get it? Should I get it?
[00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:58.460]   Samsung phone you experience that walk in you or doing or doing
[00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:04.380]   You know helping out people set up their email accounts on their phones you walk down the hall and Dwight
[00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:05.100]   I'm sure you get this
[00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:09.300]   I'm sure you get this a cron when you walk down the hall people are you know, I can't figure out
[00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.380]   I've got one password for this account and you end up doing technical assistance
[00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.100]   Yes, like most of the afternoon at work so hard
[00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.780]   Yeah, yeah
[00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:23.840]   I figured that whenever I leave the Houston Chronicle I can set up a consultancy and make just as much money by helping my cop
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.440]   My former colleagues get their tech act together
[00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:30.780]   John anybody ask you for tech advice at all. I play the grouch
[00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:35.580]   You're not one, but you play one on TV. I do yeah, and that keeps them away
[00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.820]   I gotta ask you cuz everybody says why didn't you get the vorac on?
[00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:45.940]   After the FCC voted for net neutrality FCC. I think has now released their it turns out to be 400 pages
[00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:53.060]   Yeah, rules unbelievable and they said John should be weighing in on this cuz he's not a fan. Mm-hmm. Tell me about it
[00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:57.940]   This is to tell you this is government takeover. No, that's all along here here
[00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:00.780]   I want to give you the history of the Internet sir. Oh my god
[00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:04.100]   That's the whatever happens do not let the government take this thing over
[00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:07.960]   What are you would rather have comcast decide what happens to the Internet?
[00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:14.300]   Comcast is doing what it's Comcast done to you besides make you have two accounts John
[00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:18.360]   We know what they know. It's a long list of what Comcast has done to me. I want to get started
[00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:24.180]   I really think these big wait a minute. Do you really think these big monopoly companies should be running the Internet?
[00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:26.180]   They're not running it. So let's go back
[00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:31.780]   Here since the beginning of time. Oh my god, whatever we do
[00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:34.420]   Let's not let the government get involved and they turn around
[00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:38.060]   boom they give it to the government with in the silver platter and
[00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:45.000]   Every other word in that 400 page document is legal this legal that legal this as long as this legal content legal sites
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.260]   Let me ask you one question. All right, if all packets are equal and all bits are equal
[00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:54.220]   What's legal got to do with it? Nothing if people would adhere to that what is here to what?
[00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:56.860]   Don't you think that I want to go to Pirates Bay?
[00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:01.880]   Oh, it's my business you want to bust me for it find out that I did it have an FBI guy come
[00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:05.060]   Oh, I see what you're saying. Your issue is with this clause and I agree with you
[00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:08.820]   This is a weird clause not it says all legal traffic should be allowed
[00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:12.260]   Yeah, and then of course they house that make all bits equal
[00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:15.380]   Well, that's a good question. That's a legitimate question
[00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:21.340]   But I think that you're never gonna have any any government bodies say okay do anything you want even illegal stuff
[00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:26.600]   Just saying if all bits are equal. I don't have this being the answer to it. All right
[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:33.800]   Do you think a government regulation in terms of I don't know murder is appropriate. It's not a regulation. It's a law
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:38.300]   All right, you think regulation and laws are different. All right antitrust. Oh, so you want a law
[00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:43.460]   No, I don't have a thorough in it neutrality law. No, I don't need a net neutrality law
[00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:48.540]   There's plenty of net neutrality. This argument is specious. It's bogus. You think there's not a problem to be solved
[00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:52.380]   There's not when the problem appears then let's solve it. There's no problem right now
[00:07:52.380 --> 00:08:00.100]   And how does all bits being equal and being the same has to do with anything legal legal legal now?
[00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:03.700]   It's got legal. Well, I think you're absolutely right if we suddenly see
[00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:06.620]   that's what people are worried about a
[00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:12.720]   Licensing for websites by a regulatory agency doing their thing which is regulating right?
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:18.140]   Yeah, you have this you might have chaos you might have like Twitter deciding to shut down meerkat
[00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:23.340]   I think there ought to be a law against that you can say whatever you want
[00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:26.000]   But Twitter if it's their business, right?
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.040]   Meerkat has no right. This isn't about Twitter
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:35.060]   This is about your internet service provider becoming a gatekeeper and telling you and telling what companies they can get you
[00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:37.920]   Of course, we see it's all theoretical didn't see Comcast do that to Netflix
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:42.940]   Comcast doesn't have to put Netflix. Oh, okay. Let's you want to bring that up
[00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:48.980]   Netflix is going to be screwed by this by the way because of everything all things being equal and you can't do this
[00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:54.700]   You can't do that. You can't you can't give preferential for any reason for payment or con or
[00:08:54.700 --> 00:09:00.900]   So Netflix Netflix has got a server at the site right over here in sonic.net
[00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:08.340]   If I'm voodoo, I'm thinking that's favorable treatment. They have the Netflix server right there in the office
[00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:14.020]   Let's get that out of there and get the Google thing out of there get Google get the Google cash the Google
[00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:17.540]   Appliance get him out of there because that's unfair
[00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:20.180]   The I'm Vimeo
[00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:25.020]   They were if you know about this week this week the CEO of Netflix
[00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:29.780]   Looking at the rules and looking at what the FCC actually did said
[00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:36.620]   That's not what we meant. That's not what yeah, that's what you got. And so that's what they got right?
[00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:39.060]   I mean, you know you be careful what you ask for. We'll see
[00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:45.200]   I think the real the real issue is absolutely real which is that the camcast said to Netflix
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:52.640]   We're not gonna buy an extra router so that you can get into our free. Huh? They're free. What the routers that Comcast does not
[00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:57.440]   Participate in the Netflix right appeal right? They don't do that. They refuse to do that
[00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:01.580]   Which is now they're gonna be with what they want to do is charge Netflix
[00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:06.220]   In fact, they do and so does time Warner charge Netflix extra for access to their customers. Yeah, I think that's appropriate
[00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:12.100]   Yeah, okay, it's their customers. They can do whatever they want. You don't like Netflix go across the street AT&T is available
[00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:18.100]   Okay, there's two choices. Well, that's not there's more than two choices in some parts of the country some parts of 86% of the country
[00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:20.540]   I have three choices. I have Sonic
[00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:25.740]   I got which I would change away from Comcast in a minute, but I don't have a choice that's anywhere near the speed
[00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:32.420]   Well, he's gonna start laying fiber. He says who he Dane Oh Jasper. Yeah, he is laying fiber
[00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:35.100]   It's like he was doing it outside, but it doesn't come to not gonna go to my house
[00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:40.020]   I wish it would I'll talk to him about if I had a choice then I wouldn't worry so much
[00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:43.660]   The problem is most people don't well the choice is one thing but getting carried away and going crazy
[00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:49.740]   Which is what this is. Well, wait and see if it's going crazy. I think you're going crazy about well perceived damages that well
[00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:52.700]   Here's why I don't really care at this point
[00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:59.740]   I would saw the hearings when the mobile industry people sat there and they make it sound as though the mobile broadband guys are
[00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:02.620]   Are not did they have just out of control?
[00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:10.920]   They're actually regulated by Congress in a law that was written specifically for mobile broadband and Congress runs that or what keeps that keeps
[00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:15.020]   Them in line face the woman that was the head of the Association
[00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:22.100]   She said that if they put us entitled to we were going to sue the FCC until the end of time and that's exactly
[00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:26.760]   What's gonna happen this whole thing is gonna end up in court. We're not going we knew that any of these things for
[00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:32.140]   Years. Yeah, so nothing to worry about that's from my perspective from your perspective
[00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:36.400]   I don't know what you're thinking you think Comcast is trying. No, they're doing they're trying
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:38.900]   I know they're trying to screw you over
[00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:44.380]   Yeah, so is AT&T and Verizon and everybody else those these big ISPs want to control the internet
[00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:48.460]   They want to tear it they want to make a toll road. They don't want it to be equal
[00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:53.660]   When that happens, I think you should take action right now. I'm not we are taking action that did happen
[00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:56.220]   You just yeah, you took action. Let's go give it to the government
[00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:59.820]   Well, we'll see what happens decades of bitching about the government
[00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:05.780]   You know the government did create the internet in the beginning and gave it to private industry and everybody said oh god
[00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:11.040]   Now we've got it to ourselves. Let's don't give it to the government. All right, and they gave it to the government. Okay
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:13.540]   good work
[00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:15.540]   after all that complaining
[00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:19.680]   Now I people wanted to hear from John now you've heard from John
[00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:24.380]   Do you ever talk about this on any other show the no agenda show?
[00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:32.180]   Hey, by the way, this is this is delicious isn't that good the problem is it's a candy bar
[00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:38.400]   This is not a nutrition anything. It's one of the great tenants of broadcasting always make sure you have a mouthful of a candy bar
[00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:45.700]   Yeah, there's nothing like it. Isn't it? Isn't it amazing? It just brings your point home to the yeah makes people want to just watch
[00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:51.460]   I think the only time I remember that was Tom Brokaw during the September 11th attacks when it was or no during the election
[00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:55.620]   It was like one in the morning. He's like look I haven't eat it was the the Florida recount is like it's like one in the
[00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:59.220]   Morning, I haven't eaten since 4 in the afternoon. I have some saltines
[00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:07.980]   That's how you got that voice now Clayton I gotta ask you you have over your right shoulder
[00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:15.420]   It looks like a baseball stadium. Is that is that your your Phillies? That's actually I'm sorry over your yeah that way
[00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:21.600]   Yeah, am I Philadelphia Phillies over the Phillies and then over your left shoulder. It looks like a rock concert. What is that?
[00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:25.860]   Oh, I took that photo at the a monkey's concert the monkeys
[00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:28.460]   monkeys reunion congers Wow
[00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:35.380]   And below that if you pan down a little bit, yeah, see a signed Super Bowl ball from Joe, Montana
[00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:40.020]   No, nice. Give it to me. Yeah, a few few Super Bowl
[00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:43.300]   I think you're too young to have actually been in a Super Bowl with Joe Montana pitched
[00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:50.860]   Yeah, have I pitch I was a long as I remember yeah, yeah, how those Phillies gonna do this year?
[00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:53.620]   I don't think so. Well, I don't know, you know spring training down there
[00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:59.060]   They fired up the MLB app the last week so you can watch streaming MLB a lot of the preseason games right now
[00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:05.260]   Isn't that awesome? Yeah, it's great. It's amazing. I'm getting on my MLB app is notifications that will ferrell is that bad, right?
[00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:09.580]   The hell was that for a whole day will ferrell dominated the nation's the nation's
[00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:15.660]   Baseball game great. It's always the Yankees that get in on those pranks to remember a few years ago
[00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:21.300]   Billy Crystal was like a year for an afternoon. So will ferrell was that for a movie it was for charity
[00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:27.740]   Yeah, he played on every major league team and he played every position. No, he only played on enough to play every position
[00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:30.780]   He wanted 10 teams 10 positions. Yeah, I guess yeah
[00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:32.860]   Including DHS
[00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:35.420]   Have you ever got a chance to tour their studios John?
[00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:39.080]   I know you're a fan of getting about the behind-the-scenes look when you're in New York City of some of these big studios
[00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:43.840]   Have you ever gone down to MLB studios? No, never have there's something I should do. Does it sound cool?
[00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:47.460]   Absolutely guys that I'll get in remarkable and they keep it
[00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:54.060]   I mean, it's it's public but it's kind of hush hush a lot of these other companies use MLB streaming capabilities for their service like HBO
[00:14:54.060 --> 00:15:01.740]   Exactly. That was a bit of a shocker because HBO spent millions creating its own streaming operation out of Seattle
[00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:04.860]   they hired a guy away from Amazon who hired many other engineers from Amazon and
[00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:08.200]   Then Game of Thrones came out last April and it collapsed
[00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:11.220]   when they announced this new HBO
[00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:16.340]   Now or maybe it was even before then they said and all by the way
[00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:20.980]   We're not gonna use our own outfit. We're gonna use MLB MLB
[00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:27.260]   And yeah, they were fiber right to the right to the stadiums. They've got an incredible operation. They can take feeds anywhere
[00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:31.380]   Instantaneously, there's no delay and of course out of New York is where they do a lot of the replays
[00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:34.940]   So right when they're trying to replace they
[00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:38.820]   Instantaneously, they're being radioed back to an umpire who's in New York, right?
[00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:44.680]   They have the they have the replay guy that the umpire in the main studio and looking at all the different games
[00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:48.760]   Yeah in this big control booth watching it. So it's it's crazy
[00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:53.980]   How yeah MLB studios if you get a chance to tour it's I think it's it's in the same building as Google
[00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:57.660]   I'm not mistaken in Chelsea Chelsea area. So if you get a chance go there and take a look at it
[00:15:57.660 --> 00:16:04.220]   I will but do they have tip do they have fire fiber right into Westeros because that's what they're gonna need
[00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:11.920]   Did you yeah, they're behind the scenes of getting all of that material from where they shoot that in Scotland Oh all over Iceland
[00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:15.900]   Yeah, yeah all over and they bring fiber to those towns
[00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:20.840]   I know Trey Ratcliffe our mutual friend down there in New Zealand and when of course the Hobbit was shooting down in New Zealand
[00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:22.840]   They didn't have the capabilities streaming
[00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:28.420]   They didn't have the type of internet access they have but Peter Jackson and bringing the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings down to New Zealand
[00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:33.060]   Turned that country into you know, like an incredible hot spot
[00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:37.300]   So there is this summer. We were at Diocletian's Palace in
[00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:42.900]   Split Croatia. Oh, yeah gracious great place
[00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:47.300]   But they had a staircase to nowhere and we would look and the guide said you can't go over there
[00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:52.700]   That's where Game of Thrones is filming and they had guards and you said don't they said no pictures
[00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:59.900]   Why because that's a staircase in the Game of Thrones. I don't know. It's the same as the no spoiler police. I got my eye on you
[00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:04.980]   All right. Let's say since we're gotten we got a good of Dubrovnik while you're in town. I missed Dubrovnik
[00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:09.640]   I missed we were on a cruise ship. We're only all cruise ship. Yeah
[00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:17.860]   Which is worse a cruise ship or government regulation cruise ship, thank you so I
[00:17:17.860 --> 00:17:23.200]   Don't know what to do now. I'm gonna take a break and we're gonna come back and regroup and talk about Apple
[00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:27.660]   That'll make you happy right? Oh, yeah. I love talking about Apple have some more new go
[00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:32.780]   This is a good thing, but it's it's like a Rice Krispie treat covered with icing, but it's good for you
[00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:40.940]   You know, I got a check for 50 cents from pop chips
[00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:45.660]   Cuz a royalty check. No, no, it was a class
[00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:52.240]   Because pop chips which is a snack food claimed to be help like some sort of healthful snack
[00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:54.860]   You get a lot of money from and somehow I don't even remember
[00:17:54.860 --> 00:18:00.040]   I didn't sign up for the class, but somehow I got in the class actually it wasn't 50 cents. It was like three
[00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:07.700]   Class action rebates calm you went there and sign us up. All right, so Jeff needles sign us. I give them a bonus
[00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:12.740]   We got three bags of pop chips or something like that. It was like
[00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:17.920]   You know, they can actually go to the act of the live dot-twit TV
[00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:22.580]   They don't need to be watching this this second rate. Oh my god dream
[00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:25.100]   meerkat

[00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:26.640]   It's kind of like it's a it's like mr. Toad's wild ride on this show where it's just careening and
[00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:31.060]   And and they give you a steering wheel, but then you're going like this, but doesn't do anything
[00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:35.800]   It's not connected to anything. It's not connected anything and then the fireplace and you go right through it

[00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:17.440]   Thank you Linda for your support this week in tech so mere cat is an interesting story because it was written by
[00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:20.240]   Is it an Israeli company?
[00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:27.320]   Yes, Israeli and I get the impression that they must have heard
[00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:31.760]   That Twitter was about to buy or had bought a company called periscope
[00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:39.400]   Periscope was a live streaming app. We've seen this kind of app before right quick for a long time qwik
[00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:46.560]   Social cam periscope was gonna do something that would tie into Twitter Twitter bought them still has it's still in private beta
[00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:51.680]   So nobody's seen it and these guys at mere cat said wait a minute within two weeks
[00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:54.280]   They wrote this it came out at the end of January
[00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:56.920]   This is an app that you run on your iPhone
[00:22:56.920 --> 00:23:02.000]   It's iOS only and allows you to stream now if I how do I get to your stream Jeff so I can?
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:10.400]   So if I go to Twitter comm it uses Twitter to to tweet it so I'm going to or what what what are you using Dwight?
[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:14.640]   I'm just using if you go to what's your what's your Twitter?
[00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:22.520]   Silverman and you'll find the link that so you'll see what happens so as soon as you start mere catting a tweet goes out
[00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:26.640]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, I don't want to sign up a tweet goes out saying doing twit live now
[00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:29.280]   That's the tag you put in there with a mere cat
[00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:31.880]   hashtag and the mere cat
[00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:36.480]   URL now people can who are can respond to that
[00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:42.780]   And well actually if they chat within mere cat it will go out as a tweet right so here
[00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:47.940]   Let me let me resize this because one of the things is weird about mere cat. You're not supposed to hold it sideways Dwight
[00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:52.320]   Oh, all right looks if I will I'd switch if I do okay. Yeah, there we go right
[00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:55.140]   There's a there's a web interface, but it's very it's really limited
[00:23:55.140 --> 00:24:01.600]   And you know it isn't if you do this because it's really designed to be for the aspect ratio of the phone right right oh
[00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:07.140]   I have to log into Twitter to see it. Oh, please oh my god
[00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:14.100]   Well I don't think of it. It's really one of its. It's like the Instagram model of using app based
[00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:20.040]   You know a fully app based launch. I mean yes, you have this janky web interface, which is highly limited
[00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:24.760]   But I think you know Instagram really paved the path for saying we're going to launch on iOS
[00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:31.380]   We're going to launch web app based first with no no real web no website no back end on that end at all
[00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:37.080]   And I'm just I just flipped my mirror cat around so I'm in portrait mode now
[00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:40.020]   So you're not supposed to be in landscape mode, okay?
[00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:45.480]   This is something a lot of mere cat newbies do and I both of you obviously mere cat newbies
[00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:49.080]   Yeah, it's portrait which is weird, but it actually works really well
[00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:53.400]   You see as people follow you see you see their faces little right head bubbles
[00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:57.800]   And they can talk to you also and they can talk they can chat with you in the interface
[00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:03.360]   But then it tweets by the way, so we'll see people chatting with you like you can hear their voice no
[00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:06.040]   They their text chat
[00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:10.440]   Which yeah, you can't hear their voice so you get the chat right on the screen
[00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:12.920]   What's what's really cool about it is though that I mean well?
[00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:16.920]   That's why VCs and sure are salivating over this is that it takes over your whole screen
[00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:20.360]   So I've got 20 or so people watching
[00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:27.000]   Mine right now, and that means that their whole iPhone screen is taken over by this. They're not doing something else
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:32.860]   It's not ancillary. It's but that's true with every app is single use on an iPhone
[00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:37.240]   Sure absolutely, but I mean think about the potential for
[00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:44.200]   You know I mean you're literally have their full attention, so you have their full attention on their phone right now
[00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:47.660]   And they can't make sure they could be setting it down doing something else
[00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:52.540]   But they're not multitasking on that same device like you can on a web interface you're watching some web video
[00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:55.720]   You're maybe typing out an email you're missing an ad that's popping up
[00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:59.680]   They have you know full attention here on the screen if they want to be a part of this
[00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:03.640]   Can you show unfortunately I'm not logged into Twitter here, so I can't yeah
[00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:09.100]   I'm like trying really hard to pull these up and none of them are streaming anything that's moving for me
[00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:15.160]   This is this is what I'm getting right so and then resize your windows. Yeah, yeah, who's that?
[00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:20.280]   This is Dwight's. This is Clayton, but it's not moving, and I'm pulling it up in a different
[00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:22.280]   I was Skype with us and do a show
[00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:28.760]   There oh, how about Js. Needles Twitter comm slash Js. Needles try that that's Jeff's Twitter
[00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:31.520]   anyway
[00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:33.960]   This is because South by Southwest is this week
[00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:37.240]   This is if you're gonna launch an app launch it at the end of January
[00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:44.920]   And if you're lucky you'll get this the South by Southwest virality clearly they have like Clayton you were at the Apple event and
[00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:48.960]   And you said people were meerkatting the Apple event
[00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:55.860]   Right you're there on you know in the line going in ahead of time and a couple of my my journalist friends were coming down
[00:26:55.860 --> 00:27:01.820]   The line and meerkatting right along. What are you doing? They go on you're live on a meerkat right now. Oh really okay?
[00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:05.080]   I didn't know and then you suddenly have to wipe the sleep out of your eyes
[00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:10.160]   I have on a year cat 2010 when Apple announced the iPad I would still be invited to Apple events
[00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:11.680]   Right yeah
[00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:17.140]   You know they had to probably put the clamp down on people snapping it onto their laptops and facing the stage because after all
[00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:19.140]   Apple had a live stream, so it's gonna look
[00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:23.840]   Interesting thing we have a live stream. We happen to be streaming this live right now
[00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:29.960]   We use some reason all of these people by the way. They're all dead. What's going on with your meerkat when you when you Leo?
[00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:35.640]   Violated the rules and and shot the Apple thing they were not streaming live back in the day
[00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:38.880]   No, that's why I did it because there was no way to see what the Apple was announcing
[00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:45.320]   But it was actually a cool feature inside the demo room where we were trying the Apple watch and the new MacBook
[00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:51.940]   Yeah, people can stream live people could stream live and so you were able to get live interaction from people who were not in the room
[00:27:51.940 --> 00:27:58.240]   Who wanted answering from you know from the event? Well? How does this work or what when you try this? How does this work?
[00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:00.440]   What about usbc? How is this different than this?
[00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:04.960]   You know all sorts of questions you're able to see when you're sort of in the haze of an event like that you come out
[00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:10.680]   I know there's a million questions. I need to ask I think this meerkat thing is idiotic. Yeah, of course you do
[00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:12.760]   So here's the question
[00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:15.080]   Obviously you do John
[00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:17.080]   Here's the question
[00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:23.560]   Why is this taking off in this way when quick was around for years social cam from just the name?
[00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:30.320]   People love the name mere cat I couldn't mitata little meerkat. It's that little drawing in the marketing
[00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:36.340]   Yeah, it's very it seems very friendly and very user centric, and it's very simple cute names
[00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:40.960]   You know the back of the don't have archives makes it really really simple. It's just on and off
[00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:45.520]   That's what need a reason that snapchat is yeah needles believes. It's the evidence of the
[00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:51.600]   Ephemeralness of these videos that you can save it to your camera, but you there's no way to go back and look at a meerkat
[00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:58.840]   Well imagine yeah, right and imagine how difficult that would be or how much how incredibly expensive that would be for meerkat to be able
[00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:04.320]   To hold all of that video that people just doing random two-hour streams on their phone
[00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:07.600]   You know your phone is forced to store that but also to Dwight's point
[00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:15.180]   It's super simple you sign in and and because iOS has Twitter natively in the operating system
[00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:17.180]   You don't have to even type out a password
[00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:22.800]   So that that's a limiting you know you know when you sign up you got a new Roku box or something you want to log in
[00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:26.560]   I'm not gonna log in to Amazon Prime because I don't remember my password
[00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:28.960]   You want to type it out on that little keyboard and the little remote
[00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:34.440]   It's a pain in the butt because Twitter is system wide inside of iOS you just tap access to your Twitter accounts boom
[00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:37.040]   You're right in so within 30 seconds. You're up and running
[00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:43.560]   And you're able to start streaming almost instantly it pushes it out, and it takes over your whole phone
[00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:46.320]   People saying you know notifications still come through
[00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:53.860]   Matt McHale on my meerkat saying notifications will still pop up, so you'll still you know wife's texting you or something
[00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:57.760]   You'll still get that but it takes over the whole screen the interesting thing
[00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:03.640]   I'm curious what you think about this Clayton since you're in the news business a number of people pointed out that this is going to
[00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:04.980]   Well in fact there's a was an arc
[00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:11.200]   I'm trying to find it on medium about a guy who was using meerkat and streamed an hour of a fire rescue in San
[00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:15.920]   Francisco before the news crews got there it suddenly makes everybody and
[00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:21.880]   Electronic news gathering an ENG crew you could be everywhere in the olden days
[00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:26.820]   Pushed the record you record that news, but there's something immediate about it for instance
[00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:31.200]   Here's a prayer vigil and first it's like a hundred two hundred people at the most and
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:35.600]   so so we're looking at this at cron.com as a way to
[00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:41.280]   Do both live and then take the the video off the phone?
[00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:47.940]   Put it into we use video licious to to put together quick videos that are then put on our website
[00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:51.320]   So we can send a reporter to something he or she can
[00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:54.200]   Record it live. It's saved to her phone
[00:30:54.200 --> 00:31:01.600]   We then upload it into our system and what was live we have the archive for and it becomes part of our content
[00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:04.520]   This is real interesting to media media company here
[00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:11.400]   This is a medium article from neve drawer the guy who one of the founders who says actually Ben a heat me drawer is
[00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:17.960]   Retweeting Ben who says meerkats not so much about ephemerality. It's about how to make you comfortable
[00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:23.600]   Streaming so the fact that it isn't saved and repurposed or repurposable
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:28.900]   It's also making a virtue out of a necessity these this little company didn't want to store and
[00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:35.040]   Host all of these videos for people to watch right also. There's no the anonymity to to your point
[00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:41.120]   Well, you're not anonymous anonymous right because you're on Twitter. I mean you're very public
[00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:46.520]   Exactly, so it removes the trolls it removes the nasty
[00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:51.700]   You know it removes the nasty comments or so no it doesn't well. No you get them, but they're ephemeral
[00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:58.760]   Now now Twitter is doing a competitive product as I mentioned periscope Twitter
[00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:03.480]   Yesterday started blocking meerkats access to the social graph
[00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:08.560]   So one of the things that was really good about meerkat was the onboarding as you mentioned Clayton process was very easy
[00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:11.780]   Because on iOS you just say yes use my Twitter account
[00:32:11.780 --> 00:32:17.160]   But more than that you would also immediately follow all your meerkatting followers on Twitter
[00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:22.840]   So it's very easy to get people to watch you and to watch people that you knew meerkatting
[00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:27.880]   Twitter has cut that tie as they as they can because they control the social graph
[00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:33.040]   And I imagine the other anti-competitive motions from Twitter soon because they want to do their own thing
[00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:37.680]   They're crazy. They should let this go what difference does it make to them is gonna really cost them money
[00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:42.400]   Well, I think it actually could have a backlash. I think the meerkat community could get pissed off at Twitter
[00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:50.120]   And and when periscope comes out intentionally not use it periscope does some different things one of the things per not you've played with it
[00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:52.480]   Clayton so I would love to hear your your opinion
[00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:55.960]   But one of the things I know it does differently is it does save and will
[00:32:55.960 --> 00:33:01.540]   Reserve your video at any time it is not ephemeral and when it replays the video replays the comments
[00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:07.400]   Also another difference is on meerkat when you comment on somebody's stream it becomes a tweet
[00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:09.120]   from you
[00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:14.360]   With your comment in other words and and as an at reply I when I use meerkat
[00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:16.520]   I suddenly see all these people in my Twitter stream
[00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:22.640]   Periscope won't do that. It will allow people to comment, but they won't say clogs up your Twitter
[00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:24.640]   So it does it tends to clog up your Twitter screen
[00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:30.520]   So the lack the lack of ephemerality is the one of the big differences between periscope
[00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:33.400]   Tell me what it was like you used it. What did it?
[00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:40.720]   Really interface similar briefly. It's it's it's it's similar, but I saw a beta of it
[00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:44.200]   And I didn't get to play much you know play much with it so right now
[00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:47.080]   It is in beta you have to request if you go to periscope app thing
[00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:48.560]   It's periscope I forget what it is yeah
[00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:52.520]   I request app because I would love to try it did they give you a timeline on that no
[00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:58.820]   So I saw hands-on with someone who was kind of on the down low about it. It's periscope periscope. What is it?
[00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:00.920]   No, this is a periscope app.co
[00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:06.240]   Doesn't say anything yeah, that doesn't say about the timeline yeah
[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:13.680]   Yeah, so they're they're kind of keeping it hidden right now, but you know it'll be interesting to see if if now
[00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:18.680]   Are people so ingrained with meerkat that they're not willing to jump over to periscope. I don't know
[00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:21.860]   There's no friction users are there in meerkat
[00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:28.640]   Do we have a number the last number I saw was about a hundred and thirty five thousand and then they had added
[00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:36.320]   More as a in fact they jumped in numbers as a result of Twitter's cutting them so there was kind of a I mean it
[00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:40.540]   Made news that got them got the more attention and now they have even more users
[00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:43.640]   So well it's out. It's been huge at South by I mean right
[00:34:43.640 --> 00:34:50.040]   You could attend South it kind of it's interesting and and I probably have a little more
[00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:53.080]   Skin in this game only because we're live streamers
[00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:58.480]   And when we were at South by Southwest live-streaming South by Southwest four years ago. It was us
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:03.140]   And I did a you know the live crowd surf and all of that. Well you bailed out just in time
[00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:10.560]   Wow now anybody could live stream from anywhere including a crowd surf there there we go there some some of them
[00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:17.060]   Yeah, they were down meerkat actually said on their Twitter. They were down for maintenance for 15 minutes or so now
[00:35:17.060 --> 00:35:19.060]   We're seeing clay now back, but see this
[00:35:19.060 --> 00:35:23.840]   Stretches out in strange ways no I've got it. I've got it set up
[00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:29.960]   Restorating you know it's just really why I put on a lot of Christmas weight
[00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:40.120]   And I've turned mine off so all right, it's a very good boy this entertainment at its best especially the Clayton feed
[00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:43.200]   Clayton
[00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:48.400]   Is great stuff there's also a lot of latency about a half minute latency something like that and
[00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:51.520]   Apparently periscope will not be so latent although
[00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:54.720]   Toshie suddenly get latent
[00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:57.800]   No, I think it's an interesting story
[00:35:57.800 --> 00:36:03.640]   It's just another it strikes me as being just another one of those flash-in-the-pan viral moments. That's hope
[00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:07.360]   But maybe not maybe there's some value to it
[00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:12.320]   I'm about to ban it. What do you think the value?
[00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:15.400]   You know you maybe you're doing something that
[00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:21.860]   Friends to watch in real time, but I'm banning the damn thing high schools all over the nation banning meerkat
[00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:26.840]   You know it's interesting Alex Lindsay brought up something interesting this week, and I've heard this among video
[00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:31.120]   video producers as well from the TV side which is
[00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:35.840]   Impromptu broadcasts you know the very limited viewership
[00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:42.360]   Without it being scheduled at a scheduled time where most you can't schedule meerkats although. That's an interesting. Yeah, I don't know
[00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:45.160]   so the sort of impromptu
[00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:47.440]   Sked you know impromptu
[00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:49.440]   streaming video doesn't really
[00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:55.100]   You know doesn't really work. Well. It's not gonna threaten Fox. It's not millions of viewers
[00:36:55.100 --> 00:37:00.560]   I had nine my largest beer cat stream was 999 people, but I think that's because I broke it
[00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:05.760]   So what would have happened in Ferguson if meerkat had been around well?
[00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:12.200]   That's now you're that's the question now. That's an interesting probably too much organization. I think for news. It's really interesting
[00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:18.600]   Yeah, absolutely, so you're getting it on the Houston Chronicle meerkat you getting stuff there
[00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:24.440]   Well, we I've still been playing with it just on my account, but what I want to do with it is
[00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:31.600]   Get people trying it in the newsroom and then taking that video and uploading it using it the the issue with
[00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:38.160]   Vertical versus horizontal is a problem because the app we use wants it to be horizontal
[00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:42.760]   so I haven't seen yet how that how that will play out, but
[00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:47.400]   That's an interesting choice to the idea that it should be portrait mode
[00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:48.920]   It's I will say though
[00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:53.560]   I think here's exactly how it would work first of all you'd never be able to toss to a reporter using this
[00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:55.280]   So much with a 30 seconds delay
[00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:59.960]   You would actually have less of a delay if you toss the International Space Station for a live talk back
[00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:03.900]   So there'd be no way you could use this for a reporter hit
[00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:09.360]   But it would be a great ancillary use case to set it as you know side-by-side a reporter and actually have a live
[00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:11.120]   Feed of what they're seeing on the ground
[00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:17.200]   Maybe a second camera that that producers in a booth back in New York or LA or whatever could tap into and pull live
[00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:22.960]   Video from but you're thinking traditional television. Yeah, I think it's citizen journalism, right?
[00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:29.960]   You're producing for the web you're doing citizen journalism when you're assembling components for something that people use its destination
[00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:35.960]   Destination news that's a different thing than than the traditional television model, right?
[00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:40.800]   Yeah, an unfiltered feed certainly we were pulling feeds live off of people's phones
[00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:44.480]   during the during the Arab Spring
[00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:51.760]   You know from from the square in Iran and all over in Egypt and other places where we couldn't get traditional cameras in there
[00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:59.160]   So people's phones and Twitter was an incredible source of news. That's gonna be the great source of some fantastic hoaxes
[00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:03.320]   bad fees general public fooling something like kids
[00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:07.440]   Baba buoy to you all pretty much the same thing later
[00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:10.120]   I'm gonna tweet I'm gonna I'm gonna set up a meerkat and
[00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:14.720]   Pretend that I see Bigfoot in my backyard and I'm gonna see how many people log in to watch my beard
[00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:16.720]   lots
[00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:19.280]   Lots you don't need to pretend
[00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:22.280]   That's right. I'm in New Jersey Jersey Devils
[00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:29.600]   Is this this is reach the consciousness of normal people or is it just something that's bubbling around among the techno elite?
[00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:32.600]   Oh, it's a South by Southwest thing. I don't think this is
[00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:37.640]   They don't even know who Putin is
[00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:39.400]   Where is Putin?
[00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:46.080]   There's a show up tonight tonight's the night some meeting. Yep. His next public appearance is supposed to be Monday in Russia
[00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:50.700]   Which would be tonight. Yeah. Yeah, they went to Switzerland to have those have his baby, right?
[00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:52.480]   Apparently his mistress is having a baby
[00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:56.800]   They think maybe he went there could be just under the weather now he's drunk could be drunk
[00:39:56.800 --> 00:40:00.200]   Yeltsin would disappear for long periods of time because he was drunk. Yeah
[00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:05.480]   It's when sober up fire the leader of a great nation like Russia. I'd get drunk a few times a day
[00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:11.960]   That would never happen these days in the United States you meant it was a Grover Cleveland who had that secret surgery at sea in the
[00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:15.520]   late 1800s and no one knew where he was really great
[00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:20.200]   There's a great book on it. By the way, if you if you got an audible ad in the show tonight
[00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:22.800]   I don't know we do we do you want to do an audible ad? All right
[00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:29.160]   It's a fantastic audio book by the way, Candice Millard. I believe is her name. I could have it wrong
[00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:34.400]   I could have to my authors. It's a great narrative nonfiction. I think it's called the president is sick and
[00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:36.600]   For like a number of days
[00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:42.320]   No one knew where the president was and they put him on a black on a barge and they brought a surgeon and I think they
[00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:43.400]   remove
[00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:48.680]   An abscess or cancer from his from his mouth. I think he because he was a heavy cigar smoker and
[00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:53.680]   No one knew where he was one intrepid reporter just didn't buy the story and
[00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:59.240]   Ended up digging into it and was vilified by the administration. He called him a liar
[00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:01.380]   I think it was in Life magazine and
[00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:06.120]   He wasn't until years later that finally I think the surgeon came forward and said
[00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:09.760]   Yeah, in fact it did happen in this reporter was many many years later
[00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:15.800]   Exonerated as a result of it, but that would never happen these days where it's the president missing for four days. Well
[00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:20.080]   Well, he went missing for a while
[00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:24.960]   Or knows where the president's movements are on a daily basis
[00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:29.160]   Well, that's I think travels with them too. I wonder if that has to do that has to do with the
[00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:32.360]   transparency
[00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:45.400]   Well, I mean oh, you know what John it's finally happened Mike did you reassign my keys I did nothing
[00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:51.960]   He just blamed me for everything I show up next time blame for the camera not working correctly, which is somehow fixed
[00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:57.360]   I can't type over Cleveland. I keep getting Robert. You got something wrong Grover. All right. There we go
[00:41:57.360 --> 00:41:59.960]   Robert, Cleveland right that it's not plugged in
[00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:01.640]   the
[00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:08.680]   Let's see an honest president the life and presidencies of Grover, Cleveland a secret life the lies and scandals of Grover, Cleveland
[00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:15.160]   The forgotten president of this guy there was a lot going on president is a sick man is the title. Yeah
[00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:18.160]   Audible it's not on audible is it?
[00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:20.680]   No, it doesn't look like it is. Oh
[00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:23.560]   Kindle if you read it on your Kindle then that's where it is
[00:42:23.560 --> 00:42:28.200]   Oh, no, I might have done the whisper sink audio audio version. Why don't they have it on audible?
[00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:33.720]   They have everything else on audible that you know what they have on audible right now, which I am dying to read is the story
[00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:40.760]   Of the Lusitania. I love this his story is historic stuff Eric Larson who is a I'm a fan of I read the devil in the white
[00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:45.760]   City which is his story of a serial killer during the Great Chicago
[00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:49.680]   Exposition and it's a wonderful great book. Isn't that's a wonderful book
[00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:55.960]   So it turns out that in the in the Lusitania a situation remember Lusitania was sunk in 1915
[00:42:56.760 --> 00:43:00.040]   It was part of what got America into World War two. Yeah
[00:43:00.040 --> 00:43:04.280]   Turns out Churchill knew it was going to be sunk. This was kind of like
[00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:08.080]   Like the enigma thing that but they didn't want to read they was a so any damn
[00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:12.720]   They couldn't do anything about it because it would reveal the fact that they had broken the German codes
[00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:16.640]   But they knew a U-boat was headed for the Lusitania sounds fascinating
[00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:23.040]   Dead wake the last crossing of the Lusitania. That's the kind of book and and we love Eric Larson
[00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:30.460]   He's great. He also wrote in the Garden of Beasts. Yes. I haven't read that one yet. Is it good? It's great
[00:43:30.460 --> 00:43:37.060]   Yeah, the ambassador to Berlin right as that World War two was unfolding an American ambassador to Berlin
[00:43:37.060 --> 00:43:40.300]   He's a great screwing everybody right? She was like the
[00:43:40.300 --> 00:43:44.020]   Whore of Berlin apparently the town tramp
[00:43:44.020 --> 00:43:51.240]   William E Dodd America's first ambassador to Hitler's Germany a mile-manor professor from Chicago. He brought his wife son and
[00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:54.240]   unboying daughter
[00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:59.200]   Wow, she was screwing ahead of the
[00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:03.160]   Gestapo she was enamored of the new Germany. They say
[00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:08.400]   Wow, she was getting not have to read this one, too. It's a good book now. Here's the deal
[00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:13.520]   We're gonna get you two audible books for free. Somehow. We segued into a commercial for audible here. Thanks to you Clayton. I appreciate it

[00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:25.760]   Audible is a great resource. Obviously, we're all audible fans that listening audible books brings these books to life as you're driving
[00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:31.900]   To work as you're walking on the treadmill as you're washing the dishes or doing the housework or walking the dog
[00:44:31.900 --> 00:44:34.320]   I listen audible all the time
[00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:38.840]   And if I were you I I would suggest you try it out now
[00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:44.760]   You're not gonna have to pay anything for two books you go to audible comm slash twit and the number two

[00:44:56.700 --> 00:45:05.380]   An audible subscription is a transformational experience. I just cannot recommend it more highly they have I think that's where I listen to the
[00:45:05.380 --> 00:45:09.420]   Economic hitman book that you love so much good book
[00:45:09.420 --> 00:45:14.280]   Let me see if it's actually quite good and you know in the oral the audible version
[00:45:14.740 --> 00:45:21.500]   John Perkins confessions of an economic hitman. This is actually the first thing you ever told me that made sense
[00:45:21.500 --> 00:45:25.180]   I really liked this book. Well good you're on your way
[00:45:25.180 --> 00:45:27.960]   One of these days you'll come around
[00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:34.380]   You know who else has a great voice for for reading is David McCullough author of John Adams
[00:45:34.380 --> 00:45:38.300]   Well his new book is out. Yes. I saw that it's called the it's on the Wright brothers
[00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:44.020]   I'm actually astonished that he has the time to do these books and reads them out loud you mean
[00:45:44.020 --> 00:45:49.680]   Yeah, that's a long day to say the least you won't even do it actually this says it's not out till May Oh
[00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:52.900]   May 15th and the narrator to be announced. Oh
[00:45:52.900 --> 00:45:59.040]   But he does all of them. I think you know what why don't you do it Leo? He's done it. They don't want to say it
[00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:04.260]   Yeah, yeah, he's wonderful. Yeah, if you like history if you like negotiating science
[00:46:04.260 --> 00:46:05.260]   Yeah, right
[00:46:05.260 --> 00:46:10.080]   Mix up like if you get some of the CDs some of them on audible aren't done by him than some of them
[00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:11.560]   Well, this was a weird one
[00:46:11.560 --> 00:46:16.040]   I and John Adams he did the abridged version of all right
[00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:20.520]   And then the Nelson Runger who's very good did the unabridged version of John Adams
[00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:24.660]   And I ended up I liked the abridged version so much in McCullough's narration so much
[00:46:24.660 --> 00:46:27.800]   That I actually put out got the full version and I bought the hardcover
[00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:32.820]   I this this is an amazing book because we knew so little about well
[00:46:32.820 --> 00:46:39.700]   We didn't know so little but history did not tell us a lot about John Adams and when when you start hear his story
[00:46:39.700 --> 00:46:43.400]   It's quite an amazing story was the inspiration for the HBO series
[00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:50.780]   Anyway, look this is why we love audible for science fiction nonfiction like history business books for the latest
[00:46:50.780 --> 00:46:53.940]   Bestsellers, there's nowhere better audible
[00:46:53.940 --> 00:47:00.860]   150,000 titles strong audible comm slash twit to get your two free books today
[00:47:00.860 --> 00:47:04.700]   All right Clayton Morris was at the Apple event
[00:47:04.700 --> 00:47:07.900]   You are our proxy
[00:47:08.020 --> 00:47:11.580]   We watched with interest Apple actually had more to announce than a watch
[00:47:11.580 --> 00:47:18.580]   Yeah, surprisingly it felt like a couple events shoved into one event this time and I think caught all of us off guard
[00:47:18.580 --> 00:47:23.340]   It shows the secretive nature of Apple that when it comes to hardware there are leaks that come out of China
[00:47:23.340 --> 00:47:24.860]   We kind of know what's coming
[00:47:24.860 --> 00:47:28.300]   We saw Mark Gurman at nine to five Mac with a full
[00:47:28.300 --> 00:47:33.160]   Artist rendering of what the new MacBook would look like almost spot on right on wasn't it?
[00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:37.400]   Yeah, save a few minor little details, but that was last summer that he came out with that
[00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:43.900]   Yeah, not too long ago right right and then but we didn't have any idea when they when Apple does software very often
[00:47:43.900 --> 00:47:45.680]   I'm except it's a health kit once again
[00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:50.740]   That was a leak but very often we we don't know so research kit. I think caught a lot of people off guard
[00:47:50.740 --> 00:47:56.020]   I spent some time this morning talking with one of the leading urologists in the country
[00:47:56.020 --> 00:48:00.360]   This is the kind of guy who are you okay? I think I heard 20p
[00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:06.700]   He's one of our contributors and he's he's like the head of robotics also at Lennox Hill in New York
[00:48:06.700 --> 00:48:08.040]   So he's he knows his stuff
[00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:13.220]   He's this is kind of guy that where you know have heads of state fly into New York to to be examined by him
[00:48:13.220 --> 00:48:17.240]   He's he's that good and we were talking is is that any man in New York, right?
[00:48:17.240 --> 00:48:24.220]   More famous about the research projects though. I think this was a really surprising move from Apple this research kit
[00:48:24.220 --> 00:48:25.920]   and
[00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:28.680]   You know interestingly going open source also
[00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:35.040]   But it's exciting from from a medical standpoint to be able to get that many and people involved in research projects
[00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:36.800]   Like the doctor was saying to me this morning
[00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:41.760]   He said it's impossible takes forever to get any kind of a sampling you get people in a dorm room who just want to
[00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:43.760]   Earn a little extra money, so they're given hemoglobin
[00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:48.760]   He does they can make a few extra bucks and they rip off the little pages on the thing and in a dorm room
[00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:52.240]   I had a friend in college that did that I think that's how he actually got food
[00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:54.440]   He was given he was given blood so often
[00:48:54.440 --> 00:48:58.040]   So it you know that was exciting that was a surprise
[00:48:58.040 --> 00:49:00.400]   So let's before you go on
[00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:04.520]   I want to just kind of a little bit more on research kit because we haven't talked much about that that really was
[00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:07.560]   Backed took a backseat to the glitzier announcements
[00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:12.120]   Apple is very clear to say you're sharing your data, but but but privately
[00:49:12.120 --> 00:49:17.520]   And what it's I you know I talking to our resident physician here. Dr. Mom
[00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:23.480]   She made the point that this is a first step to getting Apple
[00:49:23.480 --> 00:49:30.680]   Diagnostics approved by the FDA for instance, you know they talked about
[00:49:30.680 --> 00:49:33.320]   you can use
[00:49:33.320 --> 00:49:36.080]   Their this application if you have Parkinson's
[00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:42.440]   To diagnose you talk into you breathe into it talk into it or you tap back and forth
[00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:44.960]   And then it would give you it would do some diagnostics
[00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:48.080]   But of course those diagnostics are not FDA approved
[00:49:48.080 --> 00:49:55.080]   so the first step to doing that is to create this research kit and to get as many of these as
[00:49:55.080 --> 00:50:00.640]   These data points as possible. It's in effect. You're participating in the trials
[00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:09.680]   For a product that at some point could be used and insurers would pay for in lieu of for instance a visit from a home nurse
[00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:12.880]   So right now they have no diagnostic value
[00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:14.560]   This is part of a larger process
[00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:20.280]   And I think very important to Apple because I think one of the things that happened with the Apple watch is they wanted to do
[00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:25.520]   Things like that. They want the iPhone to do things like that and the FDA said well first you got to prove it works
[00:50:26.120 --> 00:50:33.720]   Right. There are certain things that get FDA approval. I I moderated a panel at CES. I think not last year maybe
[00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:41.080]   With it was fun because we had a range of we had first of all physicians who worked directly and had to seek FDA approval
[00:50:41.080 --> 00:50:46.400]   For for all sorts of heart, you know heart rate monitors and then also
[00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:51.160]   consumer based tech tech tech operators who were there who were
[00:50:51.520 --> 00:50:56.520]   focused on the broader consumer aspect of health sort of the Fitbits of the world and
[00:50:56.520 --> 00:51:02.120]   Not being able to get FDA approval for the sort of broader consumer data
[00:51:02.120 --> 00:51:07.320]   We know that Nike for instance Nike had all of that data wire did a great piece on it a few years ago
[00:51:07.320 --> 00:51:11.240]   Well how Nike was sitting on all of this data about people they didn't know what to do with it
[00:51:11.240 --> 00:51:13.720]   They didn't know what to do with all of this
[00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:17.680]   You know all of the data from people jogging all around the world. They could look at it
[00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:23.640]   It was fun, but they can't really do anything with it 24 me got in trouble even though they completely anonymized all their genetic
[00:51:23.640 --> 00:51:28.560]   Information for use in Parkinson's research and people said wait a minute. What are you doing?
[00:51:28.560 --> 00:51:34.000]   So what's weird is you can use for instance. There's let's as an example like the Dexcom
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:41.160]   It's an FDA approved device that it's a glucose monitor and it goes into its own dock
[00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:44.200]   On its own it got FDA approval
[00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:50.480]   It is able though to share the information from that dock through your phone to the cloud
[00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:55.520]   So presumably it could be using Wi-Fi also so you can use the iPhone to share it
[00:51:55.520 --> 00:52:01.760]   But the iPhone itself doesn't have any kind of FDA approval so this glucose monitor separately and it takes years to get this approval
[00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:06.600]   So by the time it finally hits the market you've already got update. You know, you've already got updates
[00:52:06.600 --> 00:52:12.640]   You've already got ways to improve it. It's already behind the times and the way in which we can develop software so quickly on the iPhone
[00:52:12.840 --> 00:52:17.560]   We can we can make changes very quickly and we can get updates out there to the public very quickly
[00:52:17.560 --> 00:52:21.680]   And we don't have to wait for this long long long path of FDA approval. So
[00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:23.560]   Where are you kidding?
[00:52:23.560 --> 00:52:29.020]   But you still can't use it to diagnose until you get FDA approval, correct?
[00:52:29.020 --> 00:52:35.200]   And that's so that's really don't I think people might say oh, this is great. This will be useful for me to diagnose
[00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:39.480]   Something it won't be what you're doing is participating in a research study
[00:52:39.880 --> 00:52:43.160]   That is going to be used to validate the data so that down the road
[00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:47.760]   Perhaps you'll get a diagnostic tool with F but it has to be approved by the FDA
[00:52:47.760 --> 00:52:54.280]   It'll be on just the data that you're providing if you have type 2 diabetes for instance in the diabetes app that I think was
[00:52:54.280 --> 00:53:00.000]   Developed by the Massachusetts General Hospital off the top of my head if I'm remembering right five apps that they featured and
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:03.760]   For instance that will give you data about the last time you've taken your medicine
[00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:08.960]   Monitoring of different things. So beyond just the data that you're providing you're also getting great feedback
[00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:11.760]   Reminding you to take certain medications at certain times
[00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:16.520]   So I guess I guess it's legal to do that. So it says glucose success
[00:53:16.520 --> 00:53:22.240]   That's the app you're talking about helps you keep track of health behaviors important for people type 2 diabetes
[00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:27.000]   Data you share through the app as part of the research study will create an unprecedented
[00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:31.200]   crowdsourced database of health behaviors and glucose values
[00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:36.200]   But but at no point are you gonna get any recommendations from this yet?
[00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:41.720]   But I hope that we will have and that I think that's what happened with the Apple watch is I think that they wanted to
[00:53:41.720 --> 00:53:47.760]   Do a lot of stuff and they found out that they couldn't without FDA approval. This is their intermediate step
[00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:53.360]   Meanwhile the Apple watch can you could draw pretty pictures and send it to your buddies?
[00:53:53.360 --> 00:53:56.560]   Yeah, one of the questions that I had about and I haven't seen this answered
[00:53:56.560 --> 00:54:00.840]   Maybe it's been in some other stories, but one of the issues with when you have
[00:54:01.920 --> 00:54:06.800]   Voluntary samples is that it's kind of sample chaos where if you have all these people coming in
[00:54:06.800 --> 00:54:10.160]   Yeah, they get a huge amount of data, but there's no control or
[00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:15.280]   Way to make sure that any of the data anybody is supplying is really accurate
[00:54:15.280 --> 00:54:20.000]   You know, there's not not all of it is sensor based and there's really no
[00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:22.800]   There's no oversight for for the data
[00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:28.160]   How much can people who are doing these studies rely on the data that comes from these apps?
[00:54:28.160 --> 00:54:33.860]   Right. Actually, dr. Mom is correcting me. She said you can use information for personal diagnosis
[00:54:33.860 --> 00:54:36.040]   But a health care provider can't
[00:54:36.040 --> 00:54:38.640]   Until FDA has approved it
[00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:44.680]   But that means an app but dr. Mom doesn't that mean the app can't tell you can't make a recommendation without approval
[00:54:44.680 --> 00:54:48.420]   I don't think the app can do anything. You could I guess make some make you draw your own conclusions
[00:54:48.420 --> 00:54:51.560]   But you could be at areas, you know
[00:54:51.560 --> 00:54:55.760]   I lived in one time when I was an anchor in southern, West Virginia in Bluefield, West Virginia
[00:54:55.760 --> 00:54:59.400]   That the complaint was there was no heart center nearby. I mean within like an hour
[00:54:59.400 --> 00:55:03.640]   So be able to get this data to a doctor that could look via, you know
[00:55:03.640 --> 00:55:08.080]   via the app whether there's their monitoring it live and they're able to see I
[00:55:08.080 --> 00:55:13.340]   Don't fluctuations in blood pressure or otherwise and they're able to make using a camera, you know
[00:55:13.340 --> 00:55:15.040]   I often thought the Google Glass was a joke
[00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:20.820]   I thought one of the areas that could have been very useful was being able to have a doctor's eyes looking at via a camera
[00:55:20.820 --> 00:55:22.820]   And being able to have a connection for
[00:55:22.820 --> 00:55:24.400]   right
[00:55:24.400 --> 00:55:27.000]   Dr. Meerkat to you your cat is saving lives
[00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:33.120]   John are you worried about the insurance industry getting a hold of this? Well, I'm so predictable
[00:55:33.120 --> 00:55:38.360]   That's a softball question, of course, of course the problem
[00:55:38.360 --> 00:55:41.880]   All they want to do is find all kinds of ways to charge you more money for your insurance
[00:55:41.880 --> 00:55:47.540]   And this is one of the methodologies they'll use are you gonna get an Apple watch you look like a natural for the
[00:55:47.540 --> 00:55:52.880]   $17,000 Apple edition. Yeah, I do look just like a guy who'd be wearing this piece of crap
[00:55:52.880 --> 00:55:55.400]   Did you like Kevin Rose's tech crunch article?
[00:55:55.400 --> 00:55:58.440]   I know that you were upset by this because you're gonna get the gold watch
[00:55:58.440 --> 00:56:02.040]   I'm now not Rose has said which I think is very interesting. It's a douchebag
[00:56:02.040 --> 00:56:06.160]   He has created a meme that anyone with the gold Apple watch
[00:56:06.160 --> 00:56:09.760]   Which he says is only worth $1,800 in gold right a lot
[00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:14.160]   He says that anyone who buys a Apple gold watch is a douchebag
[00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:14.600]   Yeah
[00:56:14.600 --> 00:56:21.480]   And then he showed a bunch of tweets from various women all claiming that they would see that anyone where this as a douchebag
[00:56:21.480 --> 00:56:26.120]   Anna Kendrick says we should be she's of course the perky and lovable
[00:56:26.120 --> 00:56:33.480]   I don't know. She's from pitch perfect, right? And she was in into the woods played Cinderella
[00:56:33.480 --> 00:56:40.160]   We should be thanking Apple for launching the $10,000 quote Apple watch is the new gold standard in
[00:56:40.160 --> 00:56:42.600]   douchebag detection. Yeah
[00:56:42.600 --> 00:56:49.160]   Leo I think that that Kevin is right because my father is a jeweler
[00:56:49.280 --> 00:56:51.600]   Yeah, he spent years working for sales
[00:56:51.600 --> 00:56:57.860]   I grew up around watches and and even sold watches as a teenager and a college student in his stores and
[00:56:57.860 --> 00:57:02.800]   Kevin is right that that traditionally expensive watches have a
[00:57:02.800 --> 00:57:07.600]   Cachet because of the length of time you would keep them and pass them on and
[00:57:07.600 --> 00:57:15.680]   But and for collectors solid gold watches have value for the gold Apple because it's a technology piece and not really a timepiece
[00:57:15.680 --> 00:57:18.640]   Has done away with both of those
[00:57:19.440 --> 00:57:25.900]   Aspects to it and nobody's gonna take this and saying son. I'm handing you down my apple watch. Thanks, dad
[00:57:25.900 --> 00:57:29.700]   You got a Casio watch to give me too. Yes, something that works something that's new
[00:57:29.700 --> 00:57:36.480]   Well, I do have I think a borderline collectible watch which is I have one of the original Fairchild
[00:57:36.480 --> 00:57:41.720]   That's collectible watch that you have to push the 404 in it. It had some little
[00:57:42.760 --> 00:57:49.160]   But far it's Fairchild. He says yes Fairchild Fairchild you push the button and then they had an LED
[00:57:49.160 --> 00:57:53.320]   Would light up for half a second because otherwise it was a red
[00:57:53.320 --> 00:57:53.800]   Yeah
[00:57:53.800 --> 00:58:00.800]   And you would see the time and it became like a thing in this I guess the 70s where people would 70s right push the button
[00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:03.800]   Because you'd show look I've got this watch on watch me push the button
[00:58:03.800 --> 00:58:07.720]   And so it was a it was a prestige item for a very short watches have been douchebag
[00:58:07.800 --> 00:58:13.720]   Detectives detectors for decades it turns out that might be the case Kevin quotes Patek Philippe's ad campaign
[00:58:13.720 --> 00:58:17.000]   I got it for five bucks at a garage. Did you? Well, I see it's worth something
[00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:24.400]   You never actually own a Patek Philippe. You're merely looking after it for the next generation
[00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:27.780]   Yeah, there's that's a good there's no hand-me-down value
[00:58:27.780 --> 00:58:29.880]   but you know and actually I was really surprised because
[00:58:29.880 --> 00:58:35.720]   even in at least in technology if you bought a $350 computer or a
[00:58:36.360 --> 00:58:40.800]   $10,000 computer you would at least get more RAM or a faster processor
[00:58:40.800 --> 00:58:45.240]   But weirdly enough you're getting exactly the same Apple watch
[00:58:45.240 --> 00:58:50.960]   Exactly, there's no more memory. There's no special processor. They didn't they didn't do anything
[00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:53.720]   You're just getting some gold and and whoa
[00:58:53.720 --> 00:59:01.100]   Here's another fun thing on pricing the $10,000 Apple watch comes with a fluoro elastic band
[00:59:02.040 --> 00:59:06.360]   Rubber band if you want the leather band same watch
[00:59:06.360 --> 00:59:10.880]   17,000 so the band $2,000 band of leather
[00:59:10.880 --> 00:59:17.840]   $7,000 band or seven thousand seven thousand dollars it has it has gold clasp on it. It has about
[00:59:17.840 --> 00:59:25.120]   500 bucks of gold right. I think that I think the gold edition watch has been a distraction. I agree
[00:59:25.120 --> 00:59:27.720]   It's not the point right, you know
[00:59:28.080 --> 00:59:35.060]   They into Dwight's to Dwight's point though that they don't think of this as it or that it's not being presented as a timepiece
[00:59:35.060 --> 00:59:40.240]   You go right to Apple comm it's one of the first things it's just bizarre
[00:59:40.240 --> 00:59:43.020]   Above the other ways to stay in touch
[00:59:43.020 --> 00:59:49.240]   They say it's an incredibly precise timepiece you go through all the ways that it said keeps time within 50 milliseconds
[00:59:49.240 --> 00:59:54.920]   Incredibly precise time keeps time within 50 milliseconds
[00:59:55.600 --> 01:00:02.380]   Of the definitive global time standard, I think the more important by the way, where's it getting that time from your iPhone?
[01:00:02.380 --> 01:00:06.440]   So apparently your iPhone knows what time it is - yeah, so what do you need this thing?
[01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:08.660]   Well, that's that's the question right?
[01:00:08.660 --> 01:00:13.040]   I think this is a unique moment for Apple and whether or not and I'm just spitballing here
[01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:18.100]   But I think next to the iPad Apple is facing its most unique messaging challenge in years, right?
[01:00:18.100 --> 01:00:22.400]   Convince me that I need this device above what I already enjoy about the iPhone
[01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:27.200]   Or just simply don't mention the iPhone at all and it's interesting if you read Apple comm
[01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:30.280]   You'll notice that if you look on this page the watch page here
[01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:34.280]   It only mentions the iPhone once and it only mentions it as an aside
[01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:40.040]   Which is during the timepiece section where it says that it's in conjunction with your iPhone comma
[01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:43.580]   It keeps time with now if you go to the iPad page
[01:00:43.580 --> 01:00:49.640]   The why buy an iPad page it shows it mentions the iPhone
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:56.300]   Repeatedly and it mentions them working in handoff. It's just funny because you don't need an iPhone to use an iPad, right?
[01:00:56.300 --> 01:01:01.400]   But you need it for an Apple watch right an app it but for how long that's so that's the question, right?
[01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:02.720]   Apple's at a unique moment here
[01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:08.440]   We we have to imagine that it won't I happen to think that it won't be for very long that you'll need an iPhone
[01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:13.040]   Paired with this device. And so does Apple see this as the future of communication?
[01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:20.760]   Beyond the phone and could we see a time where the iPhone becomes like the iPod denigrated to the dustbins?
[01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:24.380]   And now people are using this device the Apple presents it right on their page
[01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:24.800]   Yeah
[01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:27.880]   that we think that this is the most intimate way to communicate and
[01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:32.800]   It's better than any other communications device because it you're wearing it
[01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:38.520]   So, you know if you you can read between the lines or you can read exactly what Apple's saying about it right on their page
[01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:45.700]   But they think that this is this is the most impersonal product they've ever made and it's that way because you're wearing it on your body
[01:01:45.700 --> 01:01:48.280]   But it is a logical successor
[01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:51.260]   I mean the computers started in a big room and then they got
[01:01:51.260 --> 01:01:56.240]   Refrigerator sized and then desktop size then laptop size then pocket size. I
[01:01:56.240 --> 01:02:02.520]   Mean there is a point which you don't want to get any smaller, but the watch is the next logical progression
[01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:07.120]   Yeah, well, we've seen this progression with larger screens on the phones, right? There does become a point
[01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:11.240]   Yeah, where the screen gets too small to use right? So there's a UI problem
[01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:12.400]   Yeah
[01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:17.600]   I know about 30 minutes playing with it pretty heavily this week and I try and dive through the software as much as you can
[01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:23.880]   Do in 30 minutes and you know playing with text messages and I have to say that the reason that I would buy it is
[01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:27.700]   Because it does the things that I do on my phone faster
[01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:30.280]   So it gets me back, you know
[01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:36.760]   There's been this resentment sort of bubbling for a while about sort of hostility around technology as a scapegoat for social
[01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:40.240]   Detachment people with their heads down at dinner, you know not paying attention
[01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:44.160]   So the things that the phone there's things that the watch does best
[01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:50.920]   Are the areas where it's pushing that information right to your wrist the text message from your wife? Hey, I'm on my way home
[01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:57.300]   Here's a quick message back the turn-by-turn directions tap left to make a left if you're to tap right if you're walking through the city
[01:02:57.300 --> 01:03:02.440]   I don't have to be fumbling around in my pocket an uber ride is two minutes away. Just glance down
[01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:06.200]   Oh, it's he's two minutes away. We can continue talking here outside of this bar or nightclub
[01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:11.680]   You know those little things where I'm not spending 10 minutes that in time suck mode by opening my phone
[01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:18.040]   Responding to that text message and I'm doing 50 other things before I realized that I oh I was only opening this just to respond
[01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:20.680]   To a text message. I thought not getting one until
[01:03:20.680 --> 01:03:23.260]   we see
[01:03:23.260 --> 01:03:25.260]   Microsoft office for the
[01:03:25.260 --> 01:03:32.680]   Soon as that happens, I'm in no, I don't know. Yeah Excel they've announced Excel will run on the Apple
[01:03:32.680 --> 01:03:34.680]   It's gonna be fantastic building spreadsheets
[01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:39.440]   I've been I've been recommending that with this device
[01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:47.280]   That you not get this model version 1.0 and I that's kind of a truism in general for technology
[01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:49.280]   But if you look at Apple's
[01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:54.400]   New entries into categories each one of them the iPhone and the iPad
[01:03:54.400 --> 01:04:00.320]   Each one of them when version 2 came out it was so much more affordable and so much more capable
[01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:02.520]   thinner lighter
[01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:09.060]   I think that you're gonna see that happen here. I mean remember what the iPad one looked like compared to the iPad 2 and the
[01:04:09.060 --> 01:04:14.600]   iPhone compared to the iPhone 3 GS. I think people who buy this now and
[01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:19.600]   Anticipate that they're gonna be happy a year from now are gonna be really sad
[01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:24.520]   I would love to unpack that I would love to unpack that Dwight so I agree with you
[01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:29.800]   There's a huge difference here. The iPhone was extremely popular when it first came out was a big deal
[01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:37.240]   The iPad when it first came out is extremely popular was a big deal this I'm not saying that kind of same similar demand
[01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:40.880]   And I think the second model be just as crappy as the first
[01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:48.000]   Well, I agree with Dwight on certain areas right so pairing with your phone right this idea of tethering is somehow limiting, right?
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.040]   And we I don't know
[01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:53.120]   It's got to be standalone
[01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:54.440]   So it's got to be standalone
[01:04:54.440 --> 01:05:00.240]   So I'm just curious with the areas that you think that the first generation is limited and where maybe a generation two or three
[01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:04.400]   Wouldn't be I'd love to hear your thoughts. Well, we there have been stories where in which
[01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:13.480]   Reporters have indicated that Apple was not particularly happy with the number of sensors particularly in terms of health and other capabilities in it
[01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:20.440]   So I think you'll see more sensors that make it even more useful then I think there's a good chance that it may be
[01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:23.920]   Wi-Fi standalone in the second generation
[01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:29.480]   I don't think we're yet at the the technology relation to batteries and LTE that you'll see
[01:05:29.480 --> 01:05:32.040]   standalone for
[01:05:32.040 --> 01:05:36.200]   wireless over LTE, although you know, you got to know that the
[01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:42.120]   Cell companies seeing yet another revenue stream from your watch as well as your iPhone
[01:05:42.120 --> 01:05:45.320]   Are probably going to be drooling over that capability
[01:05:45.320 --> 01:05:51.340]   But I think that the standalone is the is the number one thing and I think it needs to be thinner and lighter
[01:05:51.340 --> 01:05:55.500]   I don't really see a lot of women being interested in buying this watch at this point
[01:05:55.500 --> 01:05:59.400]   I think they need to have a version that's much smaller for women's wrists
[01:05:59.400 --> 01:06:08.640]   Five million of them five. That's well that was the leak and I that it came from the Wall Street Journal and I think
[01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:14.800]   I was with a bunch of nursery school dads last night over a bottle of scotch and we had a bet we had a little wager
[01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:16.800]   Yeah, we're all stories
[01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:20.240]   So I could I can that's how I bring you into the train professional
[01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:26.600]   Over a bottle of scotch. We're sitting by the fire four of us at the civil potluck get together last night all all tech
[01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:32.360]   You know tech guys some from the advertising world and just disparate disparate lives all with all with preschoolers and
[01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:39.000]   nursery schoolers and we're talking about the Apple watch and we all laid down our bets as to how many we think that will sell and
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.400]   different numbers being floated around and and
[01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:46.280]   Remember, you know people thought that the iPad would sell far less than it did in that first year
[01:06:46.280 --> 01:06:48.360]   And I said I threw down the gauntlet
[01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:54.200]   I said I'll bet you guys a bottle of scotch 17 million. Whoa, the predictions are 15 million, right?
[01:06:54.200 --> 01:07:00.520]   I predict 17 million this year in 2015. What do you bet because the number if you think you're actually right?
[01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:02.840]   I think that the 5 million is for the quarter
[01:07:02.840 --> 01:07:05.360]   So I think you're actually pretty close
[01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:09.120]   It's three four eight insanity if that many watches are sold
[01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:15.720]   I do believe that it will I do believe that it'll sell most in the first quarter and it will taper off until version like a bad
[01:07:16.280 --> 01:07:22.880]   Movie quickly like a bad movie, but even if it only sold five million and the average price were let's say five hundred dollars
[01:07:22.880 --> 01:07:25.080]   It's a good billion a couple of billion dollar. Yes
[01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:29.840]   It's good enough for Apple to keep doing it and I think you're right Dwight
[01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:31.960]   I don't think this is a bit that's a truism
[01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:36.280]   This is not going to be as good as the next one or the next one with Apple's first generation
[01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:38.880]   first category
[01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:41.920]   Entries, it's almost always a prototype
[01:07:42.840 --> 01:07:49.560]   The look the feel I don't think this is that oh, it doesn't feel that I don't think that say I gotta say this doesn't
[01:07:49.560 --> 01:07:52.400]   First of all, it doesn't feel heavy. I hear a lot of women saying they want this
[01:07:52.400 --> 01:07:54.560]   I you know read my Twitter stream you see people in the halls
[01:07:54.560 --> 01:07:59.860]   I talked to more women say they want this than anything else and they probably want the sport one, right?
[01:07:59.860 --> 01:08:06.280]   I'm thinking for running and yeah, yeah, it's gorgeous. I mean I plastic bad this plastic band. I'm sorry. That's fluoro elastomer
[01:08:06.280 --> 01:08:12.280]   Mr. DeVore plastic band Christie Turlington called it a rubber for sure rubber band once I saw it
[01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:15.400]   The aluminum is gorgeous and you're right Leo
[01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:21.360]   There's no real there's no appreciable difference in quality from the same watch. You don't get a sapphire crystal
[01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:28.220]   So, you know for a first generation be crazy to I would buy the 350 and you know 350 isn't a bad price
[01:08:28.220 --> 01:08:34.040]   No, it's a giveaway Android wear watches are 200 to 250 bucks. It's in the it's in the ballpark. Yeah, I
[01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:38.480]   suspect I'm curious about the marketing theory behind having a
[01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:46.820]   Seven of range I can't think of any product in the world that has a range from 350 dollars to seventeen thousand dollars
[01:08:46.820 --> 01:08:49.720]   Can you think of any product that has a range that wide?
[01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:52.080]   other than cars
[01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:54.080]   But not even ours for sure. Well
[01:08:54.080 --> 01:09:01.220]   Although you can't really get a car for said what what percent increase over three hundred fifty dollars is seventeen thousand dollars
[01:09:01.220 --> 01:09:05.840]   It's a lot. It's just to see how dumb people are to test. I don't think there's a good
[01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:11.700]   Range and intelligence test right? Holy crap. Look at these guys other watches maybe
[01:09:11.700 --> 01:09:15.900]   Yeah, it's like you can buy what is the Land Rover and you get the basically the same car
[01:09:15.900 --> 01:09:21.980]   With it without the name for like fifty sixty thousand dollars less that does the exact same thing just as well. There you go
[01:09:21.980 --> 01:09:23.700]   I feel like
[01:09:23.700 --> 01:09:28.500]   This is actually more mature than one would think Apple really is betting the farm on this one
[01:09:28.500 --> 01:09:31.280]   I don't think so. It's driven by Johnny. I farm come on
[01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:35.540]   They're betting the reputation if this is a flop. They've had other flops
[01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:38.040]   Not this level now you're really
[01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:45.240]   Experience your read you're remaking the retail experience. So by appointment come in the tables are completely different
[01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:53.240]   You're rolling out the addition and select, you know and select high-end watch stores or wherever and and certain, you know certain Apple retail experiences
[01:09:53.240 --> 01:10:00.060]   The to Leo's point the skews you have a wide range of skews. They're trying to different skews too many
[01:10:00.060 --> 01:10:03.200]   They're trying to figure out I mean, I just think again to Dwight's point
[01:10:03.480 --> 01:10:08.820]   We're at this moment where in a few years clearly this will be its own standalone device
[01:10:08.820 --> 01:10:11.620]   But though does Apple see it as the future?
[01:10:11.620 --> 01:10:18.140]   You know the iPhone I'm sorry the iPod denigrated is the iPhone heading that way
[01:10:18.140 --> 01:10:24.060]   Will that device that communications device head the same way and will the watch be the play?
[01:10:24.060 --> 01:10:26.060]   Is that where we're communicating?
[01:10:26.060 --> 01:10:28.380]   problem is is that you do have a
[01:10:28.660 --> 01:10:33.860]   You have a UI issue and the size of the screen and I think unless unless
[01:10:33.860 --> 01:10:37.940]   You combine gesture and voice and other things
[01:10:37.940 --> 01:10:41.580]   Become so good that you don't need to touch the screen
[01:10:41.580 --> 01:10:48.940]   Then you may get there and and that may be the that may be actually the the biggest advance that Apple could make in future
[01:10:48.940 --> 01:10:53.600]   Versions is a combination of gesture and voice and Siri gets really really good
[01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:57.140]   Can I jump in just real quick with one point on this also?
[01:10:58.100 --> 01:11:00.100]   producer and
[01:11:00.100 --> 01:11:02.660]   Things I'm thinking about in this conversation
[01:11:02.660 --> 01:11:10.100]   I think it's fascinating Apple is great at innovating obviously and talking two or three years down the line as far as like where the
[01:11:10.100 --> 01:11:11.220]   watch heads
[01:11:11.220 --> 01:11:14.660]   Dwight you were talking about you know thinner smaller
[01:11:14.660 --> 01:11:18.100]   But standalone those things are at odds with each other
[01:11:18.100 --> 01:11:24.020]   Don't you think is the Apple the company to be able to make stretch a battery longer than it currently is right now
[01:11:24.020 --> 01:11:26.780]   But with a smaller form factor because I think for the masses
[01:11:27.060 --> 01:11:30.260]   That would that would be the case people would want it to be a little bit smaller
[01:11:30.260 --> 01:11:35.540]   But then there goes the battery how does that happen you need it? I think you need it smaller for
[01:11:35.540 --> 01:11:37.780]   for
[01:11:37.780 --> 01:11:40.160]   Women I don't necessarily think
[01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:47.120]   38 millimeter is appropriate for women I think but I'm yeah, I just in terms of style and design
[01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:51.100]   I'm not thinking necessarily in terms of I've had the Samsung standalone watch
[01:11:51.100 --> 01:11:55.200]   I can remember what it was the gear s or whatever that you've had them all that thing is ridiculous
[01:11:55.200 --> 01:12:00.660]   I'm melted around your yes, right and when it's standalone. There's so much more demand on the hardware
[01:12:00.660 --> 01:12:04.820]   I don't want to stand alone. This is this is exactly what I want which is
[01:12:04.820 --> 01:12:10.480]   The thing that's missing I've mentioned this before but the thing that's missing from the iPhone the reason I went to an Android phone
[01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:14.980]   Is the widgets the ability to turn on an Android phone and without launching an app?
[01:12:14.980 --> 01:12:22.600]   Get all the information I need calendars messages weather what news whatever I'm looking for you set up the widgets on an Android phone
[01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:26.380]   So you don't have to launch an app all you get on an iPhone is a static grid of icons
[01:12:26.380 --> 01:12:32.580]   So what Apple's been missing from my point of view is that that quick glance interface?
[01:12:32.580 --> 01:12:37.100]   And the watch is exactly what I get from the Android widgets to me
[01:12:37.100 --> 01:12:42.180]   The watch is a natural adjunct for the iPhone and the only thing that'll get me back to using an iPhone
[01:12:42.180 --> 01:12:46.140]   I suspect and I also think we don't really know until we wear it for a month, right?
[01:12:46.140 --> 01:12:50.260]   We're not exactly and so my 30 minutes is bunk and I'm just writing up a piece
[01:12:50.260 --> 01:12:55.100]   I'm gonna put up on my blog, but you know, like I said Apple won't Apple the watch won't save us from our crappy behavior
[01:12:55.100 --> 01:13:01.020]   It's not you know, but it's gonna limit your distractions. And so I think I think of the watch staring at a watch
[01:13:01.020 --> 01:13:08.440]   Hours on end is no less annoying this way staring at their smartphone screen, but you really don't want exactly, you know in that time
[01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:10.680]   You're really the things that are most
[01:13:10.680 --> 01:13:14.780]   If you get engaged with it, you're gonna be looking at it
[01:13:14.780 --> 01:13:19.680]   You're gonna be tweaking it, you know with any first much probably the first week probably
[01:13:20.200 --> 01:13:22.320]   Right, but I think something said it people you're around
[01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:25.040]   What do you say? We want it. I
[01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:31.640]   Was just looking at the menus of the Leica camera the Sony a7 never mind
[01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:35.080]   Insulting to the people you're around
[01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:37.680]   Noticeably look at our you know, look at your wrist
[01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:43.640]   What that says is I need to see what time it is because I need to be somewhere else or I'm not it is
[01:13:43.640 --> 01:13:46.880]   That quick glance is it's an insult to do that
[01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:52.800]   Did you read that Financial Times piece that Johnny Ive was it was featured on Johnny Ive and
[01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:58.600]   It was interesting. He was quoted as saying that he one of the things he noticed with wearing a watch over the years
[01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:01.300]   And I we're all guilty of this right we do this with our phones too
[01:14:01.300 --> 01:14:03.300]   I think but we glance down to see what time it is
[01:14:03.300 --> 01:14:09.040]   And we we forget that we looked at it. So we have to glance a second time
[01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:15.560]   And so his idea with the watch is that it's it's always there. We don't we almost don't even pay attention to it
[01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:18.160]   We want it to be light and almost
[01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:22.720]   You're ignoring it most of the time and so that's one of the things that Johnny
[01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:28.740]   I've said drove the design process for the Apple watch was really keeping it out of the way
[01:14:28.740 --> 01:14:30.740]   So you're not really paying attention to it
[01:14:30.740 --> 01:14:35.720]   There is an amazing blog post that everybody should read I think
[01:14:35.720 --> 01:14:39.760]   from a designer and manufacturer of
[01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:44.380]   Products his name is Greg Koenig. He's a product designer. He
[01:14:45.200 --> 01:14:47.320]   Deeply analyzed the Apple videos
[01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:51.240]   I mean far be I you know frame by frame and since he knows a little bit about
[01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:54.240]   hardware manufacturer and metallurgy he was able to
[01:14:54.240 --> 01:15:00.240]   Talk a little bit about the process and I tell you if you read this you will it one thing you will at least see
[01:15:00.240 --> 01:15:03.580]   Is that Johnny Ive following in the footsteps of Steve Jobs?
[01:15:03.580 --> 01:15:08.040]   has driven Apple's production team to an intensity and a
[01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:11.240]   craftsmanship and a
[01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:13.960]   Perfectionism that is unparalleled
[01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:19.160]   I mean what they're doing to make this watch the cheap one or the expensive one is
[01:15:19.160 --> 01:15:26.700]   Unprecedented and only a company that produces 75 million iPhones every quarter 25 million iPhones
[01:15:26.700 --> 01:15:32.820]   In fact, he begins the post saying Apple sells a 787s weight worth of iPhones every day
[01:15:32.820 --> 01:15:37.960]   Only a company that produces things on that scale
[01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:44.040]   Could do this and the metallurgy that you know, there are many standard things they're doing for instance
[01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:46.800]   In order to make the gold watch
[01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:50.160]   Hardened they are not it's not about
[01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:57.040]   Alloying it's about something called work hardening, which is a well-known industrial process in this case
[01:15:57.040 --> 01:16:03.680]   They use rollers to squeeze a perfectly formed gold ingot many many times each time
[01:16:04.300 --> 01:16:11.440]   Compressing the ingot by microns and creating a super hard form of gold. They're doing things that nobody does
[01:16:11.440 --> 01:16:14.160]   crazy stuff
[01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:16.160]   ultrasonic testing of each
[01:16:16.160 --> 01:16:17.880]   watch
[01:16:17.880 --> 01:16:20.840]   Case to make sure there's no metallic imperfections
[01:16:20.840 --> 01:16:24.880]   This is a great article. Even if you think the watch is a terrible thing
[01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:29.260]   You can't come away from reading it without being impressed by Apple's commitment to detail
[01:16:29.260 --> 01:16:31.660]   I just don't how I first of all, I just don't understand
[01:16:31.660 --> 01:16:35.360]   There were a lot of naysayers Leo you recall after the iPad event and those were people who were not
[01:16:35.360 --> 01:16:40.400]   Mostly not in the room and got a chance to actually hold one and see what a remarkable device
[01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:43.280]   It was to actually hold and have like this internet in your hands
[01:16:43.280 --> 01:16:49.280]   I think the same as being the same is true of people who weren't in the room of the Apple the Apple watch
[01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:53.720]   And I agree with the sort of specs that we all get excited about right the battery
[01:16:53.720 --> 01:16:58.220]   Oh, this is we wish we could probably have it for three days four days seven days like the pebble, right?
[01:16:58.400 --> 01:17:03.800]   Johnny I've mentioning that it'll wake you up. Well that how are you gonna do that if you're charging it every night after 18 hours?
[01:17:03.800 --> 01:17:06.880]   You know, so all of those things right? It's gonna be tap on your wrist
[01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:11.400]   It's gonna be thinner but this all goes out the window for guys like us once
[01:17:11.400 --> 01:17:15.320]   Young like Japanese girls are using it to draw
[01:17:15.320 --> 01:17:22.560]   Emojis to their girlfriends in school and that's when these things take off and who among us would have predicted the success of things like
[01:17:22.560 --> 01:17:26.740]   Snapchat, right? You know, we didn't know about it until a teen, you know, the kids were using it
[01:17:26.740 --> 01:17:31.800]   So the kids ain't gonna be buying Apple watches. I would like to know why they think you know
[01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:32.800]   I the more I look at this design
[01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:37.520]   I just don't understand why some of these guys don't get a clue and put the battery in the wristband
[01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:43.100]   Because then the wristband won't flow around your know
[01:17:43.100 --> 01:17:47.440]   I think you can be like a water you could make a battery that would flow around your wrist. I
[01:17:47.440 --> 01:17:55.720]   I really don't know if we'll know what the watch means. We'll find out in about it six months six months
[01:17:56.360 --> 01:17:58.360]   I I I
[01:17:58.360 --> 01:18:04.220]   Really think that a lot of people should consider buying the cheap one and you know what it's what is gonna happen
[01:18:04.220 --> 01:18:06.220]   I can confirm this or not, but I bet you
[01:18:06.220 --> 01:18:10.040]   You and Natalie will both buy one. I know Lisa and I will both buy one
[01:18:10.040 --> 01:18:15.000]   They're gonna sell two for everyone to sell because it's kind of pointless unless you can send your heartbeat to your loved one
[01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:18.940]   It's like a walkie-talkie exactly and I'm waiting a year
[01:18:18.940 --> 01:18:23.440]   It sounds hokey and I'm
[01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:29.480]   Once you've once you feel it with those taps John's never been in love. He doesn't understand. I've been in love plenty
[01:18:29.480 --> 01:18:35.680]   I've fallen in love every day the idea of sending my heartbeat to somebody else is a bit much
[01:18:35.680 --> 01:18:39.380]   Or you know, I don't know orders on cornball
[01:18:39.380 --> 01:18:43.340]   It does but it's coming up on my way home or yes
[01:18:43.340 --> 01:18:51.560]   Oh, not even that just a little if you draw a little heart on your watch and Natalie sees that little heart that you drew
[01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:54.320]   Well, that's love man. No, it's not
[01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:59.960]   It's a little heart you drew it could be beautiful. You could be with somebody else while you're doing this
[01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:04.840]   I think there will be a second Doris. I got to do something for the old lady at home
[01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:07.680]   I tell you Lisa didn't want to watch I said you have to have one
[01:19:07.680 --> 01:19:10.760]   How am I going to draw little pictures of my penis?
[01:19:10.760 --> 01:19:13.600]   exactly
[01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:20.060]   Think how more effective the relationship between Anthony wiener and Sydney Leathers
[01:19:20.060 --> 01:19:22.060]   No
[01:19:22.060 --> 01:19:25.740]   No, I do actually they will sell them in pairs
[01:19:25.740 --> 01:19:30.260]   I really do unless you're a sad lonely person like John and then there's no
[01:19:30.260 --> 01:19:33.100]   Reason at all to buy it. Yeah
[01:19:33.100 --> 01:19:39.200]   No, I I am I'm gonna withhold judgment. I am impressed by what Apple's done
[01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:46.220]   And I think that there's a lot of potential there. I've worn an Android wear watch for six months and you have it on
[01:19:46.220 --> 01:19:52.060]   No, I don't. Oh, you got no watch on because I brought my iPhone because I'm trying to live the la vida. I never mind
[01:19:52.060 --> 01:19:58.000]   I just wanted to make sure that and what this one is the multiple sizes, you know again to Dwight's point about the sizes
[01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:03.160]   You know my friend Joanna Stern and I were flying out together to to the Apple event and she you know
[01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:05.160]   She was wearing the end one of the Android wear watches the
[01:20:05.160 --> 01:20:09.020]   She's wearing the motor. Oh 60. That's what people and she took it off
[01:20:09.020 --> 01:20:11.840]   She's like I can't wear it anymore and I had I had mine on at the time
[01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:16.180]   But she's like it's just too big and I on her I was sure cuz it looked like a sundial on her own
[01:20:16.180 --> 01:20:19.020]   You know, it's so it looked like a Fred Flintstone style thing
[01:20:19.020 --> 01:20:25.340]   So this giant watch and so she she's not wearing anything right now and so and the smaller even our friend Serenity Caldwell
[01:20:25.340 --> 01:20:27.880]   Shoot, you know does roller derby
[01:20:27.880 --> 01:20:33.820]   We were out there hanging out and she she thought almost that the larger one was just a tad too big
[01:20:33.820 --> 01:20:36.580]   Yeah, so she was actually thinking that she might go for the larger one
[01:20:36.580 --> 01:20:39.680]   She thought man was just a hair too big and the small one was just right
[01:20:39.680 --> 01:20:43.900]   So it'll be interesting to see how what women think of these and those sizes. I
[01:20:43.900 --> 01:20:46.900]   Can't wait to get one
[01:20:46.900 --> 01:20:52.300]   But then you know, I also bought the new Chromebook pixel so that shows you what an idiot
[01:20:52.300 --> 01:20:58.660]   What's wrong with the Chromebook pixel that pixel 2 came out? Yeah, I know just 999 for a browser
[01:20:58.660 --> 01:21:03.620]   Yeah, you know I for a browser. I love it. Okay, it's awesome
[01:21:03.620 --> 01:21:08.980]   What is your favorite feature of that is the LTE? It doesn't the new one doesn't have LTE
[01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:11.600]   So that that isn't oh, yeah
[01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:16.400]   It's a gorgeous screen. It's a weird 3/2 aspect ratio
[01:21:16.400 --> 01:21:20.240]   They're doing what Apple's doing which is its USB type C
[01:21:20.240 --> 01:21:24.280]   But they do a left one on a right one and they still have normal connectors as well
[01:21:24.280 --> 01:21:27.880]   But that's kind of cool because I love and I've been charging with the USB C
[01:21:27.880 --> 01:21:32.520]   You can't put it in wrong. You could put it on either side. But the thing that wow, it's snappy
[01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:39.400]   Wow, I'm usually amused. It's snappy. It's really fast and
[01:21:39.400 --> 01:21:44.720]   I just I'm I was very negative about Chrome OS when it first came out
[01:21:44.720 --> 01:21:49.920]   I even got a little verbal battle with Sundar Pichai at Google over it and he was you know, he's a believer
[01:21:49.920 --> 01:21:55.960]   I have become a believer. I really think that for most people the security this is by the way super secure
[01:21:55.960 --> 01:21:59.840]   This thing's locked down. I got my mom a Chromebook for Christmas great choice
[01:21:59.840 --> 01:22:03.680]   Don't you think for people who don't need a lot of computing and have a lot of money to throw away?
[01:22:03.680 --> 01:22:08.940]   Well 999 don't know no pixel. I don't yeah $300 is normal and and write for it
[01:22:08.940 --> 01:22:15.420]   I got the other hand ones that blow up if you like Chromebook and then you get the pixel you're getting like this beautiful
[01:22:15.420 --> 01:22:20.080]   Thing I love it. It is lighter. I got to get to play with one and it's a slightly lighter
[01:22:20.080 --> 01:22:23.480]   Do you have a really there? I did I should have brought it so you could play with it and break it
[01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:28.440]   But I didn't bring it. No, I'm sorry. It's an effortless 12 hours battery life. That's nice
[01:22:29.360 --> 01:22:33.940]   That's nice. You charge it at night. In fact, this is gonna be my life going forward
[01:22:33.940 --> 01:22:38.860]   I'm gonna have a little rack where I put all my devices my Apple watch my Apple phone
[01:22:38.860 --> 01:22:45.060]   My pixel all plug them all in at night. I get up in the morning say hello friends unplug them
[01:22:45.060 --> 01:22:49.600]   Play with them all day. Yeah, but as a photographer, I know this is a life
[01:22:49.600 --> 01:22:54.680]   You're right. I still need a desktop. This is not your only computer
[01:22:54.680 --> 01:23:00.160]   I'll need a desk many people will be but because I like to do computer programming and photography for both of those
[01:23:00.160 --> 01:23:03.600]   I need a real computer, but that's a little I mean, that's not universal
[01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:06.120]   Right and actually, you know
[01:23:06.120 --> 01:23:10.120]   You know, this is getting better. It has an SD card slot and
[01:23:10.120 --> 01:23:16.240]   Google photos will crap automatically import the photos the features of this thing for
[01:23:16.240 --> 01:23:18.560]   999
[01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:20.560]   dollars less than it used to cost
[01:23:20.560 --> 01:23:25.200]   That's a snap seed built in right now. You can do but a bit of very close
[01:23:25.200 --> 01:23:32.100]   Yeah, close to something. Yeah my is there a version with LTE available or is it just not yet?
[01:23:32.100 --> 01:23:34.400]   Yeah, we expect because that's the way they did it last time
[01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:40.640]   They rolled out the nine D versions a few weeks ahead of the problem question about whether they will ever do an LTE version
[01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:45.340]   I don't know what the thinking is there but some people are saying they've said no
[01:23:45.340 --> 01:23:48.480]   Nevertheless, I don't know
[01:23:49.080 --> 01:23:53.600]   Yes, and I like to touch and by the way you can now pinch and zoom
[01:23:53.600 --> 01:23:59.480]   On the pixel now, how much would you pay? Yeah, I would pay over maybe 200 bucks
[01:23:59.480 --> 01:24:05.840]   199 you think you can you can when you're looking at a web page used to be you can only pinch and zoom is a very limited
[01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:09.520]   Situations now you can for much of it zoom in and stuff Wow
[01:24:09.520 --> 01:24:11.760]   I
[01:24:11.760 --> 01:24:15.600]   Don't know I feel like I don't know I feel like you've been scammed
[01:24:16.360 --> 01:24:22.700]   Well, this has been a bad this has been a bad few months because I bought the Dell XPS the new 13-inch very very nice
[01:24:22.700 --> 01:24:24.040]   Okay
[01:24:24.040 --> 01:24:26.440]   I bought the go chrome pixel. Yeah
[01:24:26.440 --> 01:24:30.680]   $8,000 lens over there and I got it but then no more that was that's not
[01:24:30.680 --> 01:24:34.800]   There cameras also expensive. That's not that's something. That's my private life
[01:24:34.800 --> 01:24:39.820]   This is the stuff I have to get for my my business life you wait and now let's talk about the MacBook
[01:24:39.820 --> 01:24:41.820]   Okay, cuz yeah
[01:24:41.820 --> 01:24:43.920]   lot of money
[01:24:44.440 --> 01:24:50.560]   $99 but it's a real computer. Is it is it John is it? I don't know don't have one
[01:24:50.560 --> 01:24:53.600]   So I don't let's talk about that and when we take a break and come back. Oh a teaser
[01:24:53.600 --> 01:24:58.760]   I have to pay for my camera. It's about time. The story on this lens is I wasn't gonna buy it
[01:24:58.760 --> 01:25:03.060]   Everybody says best less than ever and then they said but it's nine to twelve months back ordered
[01:25:03.060 --> 01:25:05.600]   So I thought an opportunity I thought I should or no
[01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:08.400]   No, I thought I should order it but I don't have to buy it for a year
[01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:12.720]   I can I'll cancel us you got suckered by the phony baloney back or yeah
[01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:18.040]   I thought well, I better order it now cuz it not it'll take a year week later
[01:25:18.040 --> 01:25:22.720]   First they say oh, no, it's back order. You'll never you know, they real you and next thing
[01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:26.400]   I get another message from B&H photo your lens on the way charged your card
[01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:33.740]   Hey, did you miss anything this week on to it we had a great week
[01:25:33.740 --> 01:25:40.240]   I think Jason Howell has put together a little montage. Oh, no of some of the things that happened this week on Twitter
[01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:46.200]   Previously on twit fun fact a group of meerkats is called a mob a gang or a clan
[01:25:46.200 --> 01:25:48.200]   Maybe this is the way we should do the show from now on
[01:25:48.200 --> 01:25:50.680]   Hi mirror clock tech news today
[01:25:50.680 --> 01:25:54.840]   The CIA has been trying to break Apple security for years
[01:25:54.840 --> 01:26:01.400]   The agency reportedly hired researchers to crack the security keys used to encrypt data on Apple iPhones and iPads
[01:26:01.400 --> 01:26:06.960]   This week in law a federal court jury in Los Angeles came out with a decision
[01:26:07.480 --> 01:26:12.180]   awarding a seven plus million dollars worth of damages on the notion that
[01:26:12.180 --> 01:26:17.320]   The blurred lines track was inspired having copyright infringement premised on
[01:26:17.320 --> 01:26:21.420]   Recreating the vibe or the look and feel is in fact problematic
[01:26:21.420 --> 01:26:26.280]   Especially if the elements that are protectable under copyright aren't really copied
[01:26:26.280 --> 01:26:32.880]   All about Android our friend Nicole Lee over in engadget wrote a great post that the headlines piece for it all HTC's vibe
[01:26:32.880 --> 01:26:38.680]   Made me believe in VR. She says I walked away from the demo complete believer not just in VR, but also in HTC and valve
[01:26:38.680 --> 01:26:41.980]   I can't wait to see what's next. What about when the goggles go around your nose?
[01:26:41.980 --> 01:26:44.920]   It's even more immersive
[01:26:44.920 --> 01:26:49.140]   Mac break weekly if you take a MacBook home, you probably want to take home this $79
[01:26:49.140 --> 01:26:54.920]   USB-C digital AV multi-port adapter you plug this into the type-c and you can power up you can have USB
[01:26:54.920 --> 01:27:02.080]   Oh crap is that elegant now also available in several colors of unapologetic plastic. I gave myself
[01:27:02.880 --> 01:27:04.720]   Props
[01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:06.720]   It's not plastic. It's a
[01:27:06.720 --> 01:27:11.800]   Pluralastic polymer if you don't mind polymer means plastic. Oh
[01:27:11.800 --> 01:27:15.300]   Well, there you go
[01:27:15.300 --> 01:27:22.060]   So it's not rubber. It's plastic if it's a polymer. Yeah, it's it's a polymer because most rubbers plastic - what?
[01:27:22.060 --> 01:27:27.200]   Synthetic rubbers. Oh my god much a plastic. Let's see what's coming up in
[01:27:28.040 --> 01:27:32.840]   The we coming up this week the tech giant show CBIT kicks off in Hanover, Germany tomorrow
[01:27:32.840 --> 01:27:40.160]   Adobe and Oracle report earnings Tuesday south by southwest which started Friday and is going on now continues until Tuesday
[01:27:40.160 --> 01:27:43.440]   Apple joins the Dow Jones Industrial average on Wednesday
[01:27:43.440 --> 01:27:49.640]   They're replacing the AT&T and on Friday the Sony PlayStation 4 goes on sale in China at long last
[01:27:49.640 --> 01:27:53.760]   That's what's coming up this week back to you Leo. I thought Apple was on the Nasdaq
[01:27:53.760 --> 01:27:56.680]   It isn't it's on the Dow. It's on the NYSE
[01:27:56.800 --> 01:27:58.800]   I
[01:27:58.800 --> 01:28:03.800]   Believe that they moved recently they moved. Yeah, I remember when they when they and by the way
[01:28:03.800 --> 01:28:09.480]   And there's only recently it's most companies that move from Nasdaq to the NYSE stock exchange
[01:28:09.480 --> 01:28:11.800]   tend to have a fall-off
[01:28:11.800 --> 01:28:14.520]   Is it value?
[01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:18.720]   Their stock goes price goes down. Why I don't know. This is something Horowitz pointed out
[01:28:18.720 --> 01:28:24.120]   I he never didn't happen to Apple I guess not yet doesn't happen right away. Not yet. Not yet
[01:28:24.120 --> 01:28:30.340]   It doesn't happen right away. Not yet. Not yet. Well, actually I remember when the New York Stock Exchange was wooing Apple
[01:28:30.340 --> 01:28:35.840]   Because because if you're like an old-timey stock you get one letter like AT&T is T
[01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:43.280]   Yes, T. Yeah X is US Steel US Steel X and they said we'll give you a and Apple didn't do it
[01:28:43.280 --> 01:28:45.280]   They should have taken it a
[01:28:45.280 --> 01:28:50.840]   Well, the big deal is that it's not a the big deal is now it's part of the Dow Jones
[01:28:51.680 --> 01:28:57.800]   Industrial. Yeah, which is a meaningless number. No, it's not that mean it will talk about it really it's only 30 stocks
[01:28:57.800 --> 01:29:01.400]   It's small. They all go up and down pretty much they wanted to
[01:29:01.400 --> 01:29:07.180]   Isn't it hysterical big components the problem. So when Apple finally collapses, which would be huge. I know
[01:29:07.180 --> 01:29:10.800]   Sure, are you selling short the Dow?
[01:29:10.800 --> 01:29:14.000]   You short Apple but not in the next few years
[01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:18.640]   But at some point next few years will win as soon as they get rid of Tim Cook. Okay
[01:29:18.640 --> 01:29:21.520]   So that you've heard it here first
[01:29:21.520 --> 01:29:26.880]   Well, I'm just using the model that what happened when Scully took over Scully took over Apple
[01:29:26.880 --> 01:29:32.340]   Yeah, the company drove it into the ground. No, he didn't it was ten times more sales when Scully was there
[01:29:32.340 --> 01:29:33.520]   He did a 10x Wow
[01:29:33.520 --> 01:29:36.480]   And then he did things flattened out a little bit so they say well
[01:29:36.480 --> 01:29:38.920]   We've got to do better than this and they got rid of Scully
[01:29:38.920 --> 01:29:43.360]   Spindler comes in the stock tanks and then they bring another guy. Yo really tanks
[01:29:43.360 --> 01:29:50.200]   Yeah, boom. So it Scully was actually a benefit to the company. There you go. I'm learning people always a blame Scully
[01:29:50.560 --> 01:29:55.560]   Well, you might say Scully just came in at the right time. He was a guy who created the Newton there was a product
[01:29:55.560 --> 01:30:03.060]   iPad iPad just ahead of his time our show today brought to you by the folks at Shutterstock images
[01:30:03.060 --> 01:30:04.540]   You know I was watching house of cards good show
[01:30:04.540 --> 01:30:07.880]   I don't know if you ever see it ever hear of it on Netflix at the end
[01:30:07.880 --> 01:30:13.200]   It says apparently the third season stinks. Yeah, it's terrible. No, it's good. Well, it's different
[01:30:13.200 --> 01:30:15.400]   It is just filled with propaganda
[01:30:15.400 --> 01:30:17.800]   for Windows
[01:30:18.200 --> 01:30:24.660]   There's a lot of Windows phone. That's probably product placement. They got oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, they got some but then there's also apples
[01:30:24.660 --> 01:30:31.640]   And there's Windows machines and but the bad guys have Samsung with the tossing the the image from one screen to the other
[01:30:31.640 --> 01:30:33.640]   It was a Sam's oh that was so bad
[01:30:33.640 --> 01:30:42.460]   That was bad. It's like and very blatant stop the show now watch as I take my Samsung tablet, right and throw it to the screen
[01:30:42.460 --> 01:30:47.120]   And then continue the show that was the worst
[01:30:47.480 --> 01:30:52.180]   No, that was man. It was like a man of steel remember when oh, yeah
[01:30:52.180 --> 01:30:57.900]   Zod was taking over everything and they were all on Windows phones like all of these reporters are using Windows phones
[01:30:57.900 --> 01:31:00.400]   Yeah, yeah, and she says even my RSS feed
[01:31:00.400 --> 01:31:11.360]   Anyway at the end of house of cards one of the things I noticed is
[01:31:11.760 --> 01:31:18.320]   Stock footage by Shutterstock and what I realized a lot of seeing now in movies a lot of places they're using

[01:33:46.920 --> 01:33:51.180]   Shutterstock.com is this the ides of March is it the 50th? Yeah today
[01:33:51.180 --> 01:33:54.560]   This is the day I'm here Julius Caesar got
[01:33:54.560 --> 01:33:59.320]   Schnooker's ass in you know on the steps of the Roman Forum
[01:34:00.760 --> 01:34:06.720]   Yesterday was Pi Day in fact an unusual side it was 3 1 4 1 5
[01:34:06.720 --> 01:34:11.240]   And then if you at 9 what was it 9 26 53? What is the net?
[01:34:11.240 --> 01:34:15.540]   Do you know all the digits of Pi you don't know comes nexus? Yeah, we did it live on the show
[01:34:15.540 --> 01:34:17.000]   Yes, did you we did it?
[01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:21.460]   We took a news alert and had a fun with it for the whole minute is the greatest minute of my life
[01:34:21.460 --> 01:34:26.280]   It is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter
[01:34:27.040 --> 01:34:31.880]   Which means you could eat whatever you want and not notice but you know Microsoft that one day do this for you
[01:34:31.880 --> 01:34:34.260]   Microsoft sent me pie yesterday what?
[01:34:34.260 --> 01:34:40.260]   They sent you a pie Microsoft. I love this why was also Einstein's birthday, but anyway
[01:34:40.260 --> 01:34:45.280]   they sent me and then they had like three apps they wanted to promote on Windows Phone they sent me pie and
[01:34:45.280 --> 01:34:50.000]   With there's a red zappel pie and lemon chess was quite good you have I think it's probably still out there
[01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:54.260]   Oh, I'm gonna go get it a piece of pie. Yeah, and then they sent me a Cortana lunchbox
[01:34:54.760 --> 01:35:00.200]   Now that's something that's probably a collectible. I don't know. I think they just put a round sticker on a lot
[01:35:00.200 --> 01:35:05.280]   It's just a sticker on a lunch box, but I open up inside was a Windows Phone. Oh, they gave you a Windows Phone
[01:35:05.280 --> 01:35:11.380]   It's a $50 Windows. It's like one. It's really cheap. That's good. That's that's soft at its best. I'm not knocking it
[01:35:11.380 --> 01:35:16.720]   I'll take it. Oh, yeah, you'll never use it. Oh, no. I know but still I ate the pie though
[01:35:16.720 --> 01:35:20.580]   Does that count? I have a Cortana lunchbox. Maybe it was poison
[01:35:21.100 --> 01:35:26.460]   It was poison pie. I just want to point out Apple doesn't invite me to events, but Microsoft sent me
[01:35:26.460 --> 01:35:31.800]   I lunchbox with a stick. I know that's why I can't get any money out of it cheap bastards
[01:35:31.800 --> 01:35:38.400]   Phone is missing. You know what you couldn't do for the phone. You could flip you can flip it on its ear
[01:35:38.400 --> 01:35:43.500]   You could lose you could you could sign it put it up on eBay right now and raise money for charity. Oh
[01:35:43.500 --> 01:35:49.000]   I could do that, but I'm not gonna cuz I'm grumpy. You should
[01:35:49.800 --> 01:35:57.100]   Just say Cortana a lot. So I'm really hopeful now that this type C connector is on two not one
[01:35:57.100 --> 01:35:58.320]   but to the
[01:35:58.320 --> 01:36:03.820]   Computers that we'll see more of these and someday the day will come when we will no longer have to buy
[01:36:03.820 --> 01:36:10.720]   Proprietary power adapters for laptops that day has come with without with phones. Look at that. There's the adapter. It's a USB micro
[01:36:10.720 --> 01:36:16.000]   Plug I would love to see type C on computers. Yeah everywhere
[01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:20.800]   I have a prediction how long how long let's throw it on how long until just about every laptop comes with a USB
[01:36:20.800 --> 01:36:25.940]   C port well, I figure here's what I figure is happening. This happened with the MacBook Air
[01:36:25.940 --> 01:36:30.720]   Everybody in the industry said women no CD ROM. No DVD drive. You can do that
[01:36:30.720 --> 01:36:37.120]   You can make it really thin you know body aluminum. Let's wait and see how does it do and then after it sold well Intel
[01:36:37.120 --> 01:36:39.480]   invented the ultrabook
[01:36:39.480 --> 01:36:45.420]   Which is an exact clone of it and every manufacturer made basically MacBook airs with running windows
[01:36:45.680 --> 01:36:48.360]   So they're all gonna sit back and say okay. Let's see
[01:36:48.360 --> 01:36:52.980]   How does that work for him because Apple's been pretty bold here. Did you play with the MacBook?
[01:36:52.980 --> 01:36:58.640]   I did and the keyboard is really fascinating and with the butterfly keys
[01:36:58.640 --> 01:37:00.360]   Instead of the scissor keys
[01:37:00.360 --> 01:37:07.060]   So you really don't feel any bouncing at all on the keypad and it takes some getting used to when you first put your finger
[01:37:07.060 --> 01:37:11.400]   Fingers on that keypad the keys are wider only Apple could say, you know
[01:37:12.440 --> 01:37:18.320]   Laptop keys are wobbly because they use a scissor spring. So we invented a new spring
[01:37:18.320 --> 01:37:23.520]   I think the wobble first of all, I never noticed my understanding is the new ones wobbier than this. This is no no
[01:37:23.520 --> 01:37:28.600]   No, it's not wobbly. It's a little wobbly. Look at feel that see that no even as a little kid
[01:37:28.600 --> 01:37:34.720]   But I think that's intentional. We've invented the key that conforms to your finger something cheaper and moves to match
[01:37:34.720 --> 01:37:39.880]   Where you see now the key just flat. It's flat. Yeah, it's
[01:37:40.760 --> 01:37:47.580]   And the touchpad the trackpad is remarkable and it's it's fully your brain. Yeah. Yeah the force touch
[01:37:47.580 --> 01:37:54.520]   So so that's what Serenity and and Jason and Renee said on our Mac break weekly. They they've taken out the click, right?
[01:37:54.520 --> 01:37:57.720]   It doesn't have a physical press but they have haptic feedback
[01:37:57.720 --> 01:38:01.640]   So that you think it's clicking right?
[01:38:01.640 --> 01:38:04.740]   So here's just a trackpad on my desk on my laptop in front of me
[01:38:04.740 --> 01:38:09.060]   But yeah, normally this would you know bend, you know clicks down so you actually get the click
[01:38:09.060 --> 01:38:13.040]   It's an actual click with the new trackpad. There's no movement at all
[01:38:13.040 --> 01:38:14.240]   It doesn't move at all
[01:38:14.240 --> 01:38:17.720]   But your brain thinks it does because it vibrates because it vibrates
[01:38:17.720 --> 01:38:23.040]   So and the harder you press the more of a feedback you get from this and I I'm well
[01:38:23.040 --> 01:38:27.200]   I'm excited from the laptop perspective. I'm really excited for what it could do for iOS. Yes
[01:38:27.200 --> 01:38:30.000]   Perhaps a removal of the home button
[01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:35.340]   It's gonna eat. Well, they can't get rid of the home button because they need the fingerprint reader
[01:38:36.840 --> 01:38:39.200]   Well, couldn't they do that just on the glass itself? Maybe they could
[01:38:39.200 --> 01:38:47.180]   Anyway, you know getting that feedback just from the and it's fewer moving parts, but it's it's remarkable
[01:38:47.180 --> 01:38:51.060]   There were a couple apps I played with just to see if you first just have you know
[01:38:51.060 --> 01:38:56.480]   Have a folder or an image on your desktop you hover over it and you press just a little bit harder
[01:38:56.480 --> 01:38:59.920]   it'll bring up a preview mode of that particular image or file and
[01:38:59.920 --> 01:39:06.460]   Again, it's just fooling with your brain because you're not actually pushing on anything. Nothing's clicking but it feels like it is
[01:39:06.460 --> 01:39:12.440]   A quick time video forwarding through, you know high speed the harder you press going into double triple
[01:39:12.440 --> 01:39:15.420]   You know the speed as you watch this motorcycle rider going down
[01:39:15.420 --> 01:39:18.720]   So some different areas in the operating system that you get to play with it
[01:39:18.720 --> 01:39:23.000]   But it doesn't do that all over the place Apple neither confirms nor denies this will be in the new iPhones
[01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:26.960]   But there is quite a bit of speculation that it will and just imagine for accessibility
[01:39:26.960 --> 01:39:34.640]   Yeah, the potential in iOS for accessibility as it relates to you know force touch. This is clearly where they're going
[01:39:34.640 --> 01:39:40.560]   I'm very intrigued. I can't wait to play with it. So you played with it. It works you feel it
[01:39:40.560 --> 01:39:41.920]   Yeah, it works really well
[01:39:41.920 --> 01:39:45.720]   And I wish I could spend more time with it than I had than I did of course that we'll have to wait till early
[01:39:45.720 --> 01:39:48.460]   April to get our hands on the MacBooks for testing but
[01:39:48.460 --> 01:39:52.760]   The controversy is the single port
[01:39:52.760 --> 01:39:57.320]   So one type C port it has a headphone port on the other side and that's it
[01:39:57.320 --> 01:40:03.800]   So the single port and the only other the only other hole on the whole device is a headphone jack. Yeah
[01:40:04.400 --> 01:40:07.840]   So is this the MacBook for everyone?
[01:40:07.840 --> 01:40:13.120]   Clearly not is it the MacBook for power users clearly not
[01:40:13.120 --> 01:40:19.840]   But it could be the could be the the widest spread adoption of MacBooks that we see
[01:40:19.840 --> 01:40:23.860]   Yeah, you know, but this does this does presage the death of the magsafe
[01:40:23.860 --> 01:40:31.160]   It looks like thank God because proprietary adopters adapters suck and every every laptop has always had a proprietary
[01:40:31.160 --> 01:40:35.840]   Although the Magsafe is so I mean, I I don't know how many times I've kicked that thing
[01:40:35.840 --> 01:40:39.680]   Yeah, I agree with and I hear it's so funny. It's a great product. It's so funny
[01:40:39.680 --> 01:40:40.840]   That's how Apple sold it
[01:40:40.840 --> 01:40:46.440]   How many times have you almost you know tripped over your then it pulls the laptop off the Steve Jobs said that on stage
[01:40:46.440 --> 01:40:49.120]   Yeah, and so and now it's like oh never mind. Yes, right that
[01:40:49.120 --> 01:40:56.440]   But you know, even the most recent iteration of of the Magsafe has been poopooed in the press
[01:40:57.080 --> 01:41:02.800]   Because I mean I go says it falls off all the time. I haven't had that experience but yeah, but nevertheless
[01:41:02.800 --> 01:41:06.440]   It's you know, this was a very Apple product the Magsafe
[01:41:06.440 --> 01:41:11.380]   I feel like they're taking a big chance, but only Apple not only Apple
[01:41:11.380 --> 01:41:16.060]   But this is what apples know getting at the end Leo of what taking chance the next thing
[01:41:16.060 --> 01:41:21.140]   You know down the drain down the drain or innovation. I might as well stick with that theory because everyone hates me with my attitude
[01:41:21.140 --> 01:41:24.360]   Someone wrote on my meerkat
[01:41:24.800 --> 01:41:29.160]   Matt McHale writes it does Dvorak have a heart. Maybe that's why it doesn't like the Apple watch
[01:41:29.160 --> 01:41:31.160]   It won't be able to watch his heartbeat
[01:41:31.160 --> 01:41:37.960]   Wow, it's like got to me it's like giving I don't know what to think now it's like giving him a mirror
[01:41:37.960 --> 01:41:45.080]   Can't see him. So I'm not there. I'm just gonna take the much as much abuse as you guys think you're dishing out
[01:41:45.080 --> 01:41:51.780]   No, we love you John, you know that I I do think it's a bold thing to do and I've seen some a lot of hate for Apple
[01:41:52.240 --> 01:42:00.180]   Why would and also the core M processor that they're using it is a broadwell chip, but it's very slow and it but it's very low power
[01:42:00.180 --> 01:42:05.380]   And so this will be it'd be interesting to watch how this does. I thought I was gonna get it
[01:42:05.380 --> 01:42:12.440]   I got I had that techno lust that's that Phil Schindler was talking about he said literally hashtag techno lust and
[01:42:12.440 --> 01:42:18.880]   But then I thought better of it and I if you've got a you've got a MacBook Pro a modern MacBook Pro
[01:42:19.440 --> 01:42:22.720]   There's really no reason to kind of to lust over this
[01:42:22.720 --> 01:42:26.520]   I think it's just a it's an attempt by Apple to sell more of those
[01:42:26.520 --> 01:42:31.240]   $29 adapters that you have to have every time you buy a new
[01:42:31.240 --> 01:42:34.760]   79
[01:42:34.760 --> 01:42:43.160]   79 and why Apple for a 1299 computer couldn't bundle the gosh darn adapter in oh
[01:42:43.160 --> 01:42:48.980]   Didn't get enough with the 1299 now you want 79 bucks
[01:42:49.980 --> 01:42:52.780]   Yeah, it's interesting much into my laptop though
[01:42:52.780 --> 01:42:55.680]   I feel like there are people who you should look at how you use it
[01:42:55.680 --> 01:42:59.360]   Are you always plugging stuff into your laptop or is it it's the same thing with the DVD?
[01:42:59.360 --> 01:43:03.380]   Oh, we got to have a DVD drive, and then you but it wouldn't you ever use that you don't miss that
[01:43:03.380 --> 01:43:09.020]   I got a super drive. I got a super drive here for my my my my my new I'm actually
[01:43:09.020 --> 01:43:12.180]   I never use every like once a year
[01:43:12.180 --> 01:43:17.580]   That I wanted to burn that I forgot that I did that did happen to me though
[01:43:17.580 --> 01:43:21.980]   It's it when I get CDs or DVDs. I don't have any way to use them at all now
[01:43:21.980 --> 01:43:25.780]   I can't so I have to keep an old Mac Pro around I
[01:43:25.780 --> 01:43:33.420]   Guess I should buy a super drive. Yeah, it's weird. It's like what I don't have it people send me DVDs
[01:43:33.420 --> 01:43:37.020]   And I'm looking I don't have a I don't have a hole for it so right now
[01:43:37.020 --> 01:43:41.020]   I've got plugged into my Macbook Pro. I have the
[01:43:41.020 --> 01:43:43.900]   Headset that you sent me I've got power
[01:43:44.100 --> 01:43:48.380]   I've got and I wanted to but I forgot my iPad
[01:43:48.380 --> 01:43:54.960]   I have this this app called Duet that lets you turn your iPad into a second Mac screen
[01:43:54.960 --> 01:44:00.220]   It's great, and I was going to use that today, too, but I forgot my iPad, but really
[01:44:00.220 --> 01:44:06.460]   That's an unusual certainly as Clayton said some people this is not for some people or most people
[01:44:06.460 --> 01:44:11.700]   Yeah, I is no way I could I could use that product unless I got a bunch of $79 adapters
[01:44:12.900 --> 01:44:18.620]   I think one of the curious things about the innovation on this though on USB C is Apple's role in the creation of it
[01:44:18.620 --> 01:44:22.260]   Did they have a role in it? It's part. I thought it was just a standard
[01:44:22.260 --> 01:44:28.420]   It's a standard, but according to John Gruber and his sources. He says they basically invented it
[01:44:28.420 --> 01:44:34.740]   Oh interesting that it's that they didn't invent it that they basically invented it that he said he said look
[01:44:34.740 --> 01:44:38.180]   I'm not saying that they took full job Gruber thinks Apple invented the Sun as well
[01:44:38.180 --> 01:44:41.540]   didn't
[01:44:42.020 --> 01:44:47.100]   Know that makes sense. I mean Apple invented firewire. They were with Intel, but they were very instrumental in that
[01:44:47.100 --> 01:44:51.080]   I don't think they invented Thunderbolt, but I'm sure they had a big hand in that
[01:44:51.080 --> 01:44:56.440]   She said it is that they they work closely with Intel on USB C
[01:44:56.440 --> 01:45:01.820]   Okay, I mean he made that point so I would love to see it in every laptop going forward
[01:45:01.820 --> 01:45:04.200]   I don't want to see just one port in every laptop going forward
[01:45:04.200 --> 01:45:11.140]   But I if wouldn't this be an amazing world where you could buy a couple of power adapters and would work on all your laptops
[01:45:11.260 --> 01:45:18.840]   The product you got high speed data transfer you've got it powers the device hundred watts as much as 100 watts of power
[01:45:18.840 --> 01:45:20.580]   right
[01:45:20.580 --> 01:45:22.580]   But this is also interesting to see
[01:45:22.580 --> 01:45:29.160]   Maybe the death of Thunderbolt. I think it is the death of a man about time, but you know Apple does this right?
[01:45:29.160 --> 01:45:36.320]   They created firewire and firewire 400 pushed 800 killed it said no no you don't need 800 now you need Thunderbolt now
[01:45:36.820 --> 01:45:43.900]   But a lot of $100 cables a lot of Thunderbolt devices now. No you don't want that you want type C
[01:45:43.900 --> 01:45:48.240]   USB yeah, you don't want that that's why I stay away from the platform. I
[01:45:48.240 --> 01:45:51.860]   Don't know I I like I like it that there is somebody out there
[01:45:51.860 --> 01:45:56.720]   Who's willing unlike my customers and the customers say thank you very much
[01:45:56.720 --> 01:46:01.140]   I have another way of thinking of it who's willing to say to customers. We're moving on
[01:46:02.100 --> 01:46:09.180]   We're moving on the future is here some of Microsoft does the opposite right Microsoft make sure everything works with Windows 95
[01:46:09.180 --> 01:46:11.180]   They get a warm IBM
[01:46:11.180 --> 01:46:13.980]   I think it's good to have one company that says
[01:46:13.980 --> 01:46:16.220]   Yes, you
[01:46:16.220 --> 01:46:20.580]   You bought this three years ago. It's time to move on move along move along
[01:46:20.580 --> 01:46:24.860]   And I for one am happy to accept my Apple overlords I
[01:46:24.860 --> 01:46:31.380]   Think that this is innovation for one welcome is the phrase you I'm sorry welcome
[01:46:31.540 --> 01:46:37.380]   My Apple overlords Apple is also going to own HBO now, but just for three months
[01:46:37.380 --> 01:46:41.380]   HBO is finally
[01:46:41.380 --> 01:46:44.760]   Acknowledged the rumors that have long-standing rumors that they're going to do a
[01:46:44.760 --> 01:46:51.980]   $15 over-the-top version of HBO that means you don't need a cable subscription to watch HBO on your Apple TV
[01:46:51.980 --> 01:46:55.360]   They also dropped the price of the Apple TV to $69
[01:46:55.360 --> 01:46:59.100]   That'll start sometime around Game of Thrones time
[01:46:59.700 --> 01:47:03.260]   Yeah, mid-april. Yeah, we mentioned that beginning of the show, but I think that this is a
[01:47:03.260 --> 01:47:10.220]   The other thing we didn't talk about is how important this is to break the hegemony of the cable networks
[01:47:10.220 --> 01:47:15.500]   Over broadcast. I think this is the first crack. You like that word. That's a great word. Yeah
[01:47:15.500 --> 01:47:22.640]   TV was the first crack sling TV $20 you get ESPN you get CNN a couple of Disney channels some
[01:47:22.640 --> 01:47:29.380]   AMC now so that means you get The Walking Dead and and Mad Men two of the hottest shows on television
[01:47:29.380 --> 01:47:34.580]   That's part of sling TV. Yeah, and if you watch I was just watching sling TV this afternoon
[01:47:34.580 --> 01:47:40.020]   I'm a big fan. I watch it all the time, and I don't have cable where we go up to like up in the woods
[01:47:40.020 --> 01:47:46.140]   Yeah, and you know just use that and if you use it on a Roku 3 or it's super fast
[01:47:46.140 --> 01:47:50.160]   And they've got the ads right there in line. You know if you want AMC
[01:47:50.160 --> 01:47:55.140]   For Walking Dead they've got the ads right inside of sling TV for what's coming up
[01:47:55.140 --> 01:48:00.620]   You can choose the interface is really easy you can choose like what's on right now or just scroll through the channels
[01:48:00.620 --> 01:48:07.780]   You've got the cooking channel. You got the food network. You got ESPN ESPN to all the ESPN channels or live sports
[01:48:07.780 --> 01:48:13.160]   I don't know that sling TV was the first crack ESPN seems to maybe have created the first crack
[01:48:13.160 --> 01:48:19.540]   Because often people pointed to ESPN and some of the major news networks for the reasons that they kept cable in the first place
[01:48:19.540 --> 01:48:24.700]   So when ESPN started decoupling itself and putting itself out there with the watch ESPN apps
[01:48:24.980 --> 01:48:28.020]   Their new interface on the iPad and the iPhone is fantastic
[01:48:28.020 --> 01:48:31.340]   I think you're starting to see over the next five years everything changes
[01:48:31.340 --> 01:48:37.180]   It's not a surprise though that these power networks the networks that can survive without cable companies are doing this
[01:48:37.180 --> 01:48:44.340]   But it but but the little guys you know the speed channel the National Geographic channel Fox News when are they no?
[01:48:44.340 --> 01:48:48.340]   I'm sorry. Yeah, I had to throw that what but you're not gonna see them do that
[01:48:48.340 --> 01:48:53.300]   They can't if they cannot survive without cable distribution you think that though my brother was just visiting
[01:48:53.300 --> 01:48:56.380]   He's a he's an outdoorsman. He lives down in Texas and he hunts all the time
[01:48:56.380 --> 01:48:57.260]   And he was just sitting here
[01:48:57.260 --> 01:49:01.380]   Well, I was doing some things around the house and he was just flipping around the channels. He's watching velocity network
[01:49:01.380 --> 01:49:03.780]   It's a network. It's on my file. I never even knew I had it
[01:49:03.780 --> 01:49:06.240]   You can watch that though without over the top no
[01:49:06.240 --> 01:49:06.700]   No
[01:49:06.700 --> 01:49:11.980]   but what I'm saying is that I think there's an audience for those types of type that type of programming and
[01:49:11.980 --> 01:49:14.920]   I think that those audiences tend to find it
[01:49:14.920 --> 01:49:19.720]   You know they subscribe to those magazine sure heard of they go to those events they go to those things
[01:49:19.720 --> 01:49:24.600]   So if you had an app where my brother Tim could just download the app right on his I do it
[01:49:24.600 --> 01:49:28.680]   He might do it he might watch those shows or if you bundle a bunch of them together
[01:49:28.680 --> 01:49:32.820]   Yeah, perhaps like sling right on so I joined the sling move
[01:49:32.820 --> 01:49:40.700]   Yeah, right there a little there their service where you end up can do extra channels extra sub channels for five dollars and packages
[01:49:40.700 --> 01:49:47.740]   You know I did a blog post last week in which I looked at if you took all of the the major ones Hulu
[01:49:47.980 --> 01:49:49.440]   sling TV
[01:49:49.440 --> 01:49:55.000]   HBO now adds say once one of the add-on packs on sling TV
[01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:58.180]   And you kind of put all these together you're paying about
[01:49:58.180 --> 01:50:03.200]   $65 a month where you begin to approach the cost of some of the lowest
[01:50:03.200 --> 01:50:10.920]   TV only cable packages right so if you're actually you're kind of getting back up there if you've cut the cord to save money
[01:50:10.920 --> 01:50:15.380]   And you're trying to rebuild it. You're not going to save much money. Well. That's the truth
[01:50:15.380 --> 01:50:19.100]   I mean, I think that it's pretty obvious the cable companies have seen this coming
[01:50:19.100 --> 01:50:23.820]   There's no way you're gonna be able to get internet and all your channels for less than you're paying right now
[01:50:23.820 --> 01:50:26.180]   Might even cost more
[01:50:26.180 --> 01:50:32.860]   So if you put together mine if I were I'm not doing all those but let's say that you would I pay about 65 bucks for
[01:50:32.860 --> 01:50:35.740]   100 megabits down
[01:50:35.740 --> 01:50:43.340]   And you add that six down that's 130 dollars and suddenly I'm back to where I was before I dropped cable
[01:50:44.980 --> 01:50:46.980]   Clayton you you probably don't know these deals
[01:50:46.980 --> 01:50:50.420]   I know the deals with tech TV when when we signed with
[01:50:50.420 --> 01:50:55.320]   Cable MSOs cable the cable companies have all the power in that relationship. You're begging them
[01:50:55.320 --> 01:51:02.580]   Please carry my channel and among other things they said and this was 1998 through 2006
[01:51:02.580 --> 01:51:04.900]   So it may have changed, but they said you may not
[01:51:04.900 --> 01:51:10.340]   Stream your channel you may not put more than 10 minutes of your content on your internet per hour
[01:51:10.860 --> 01:51:16.460]   Favorite nations is what they call it. Yeah, so I imagine those those rules are still or maybe not
[01:51:16.460 --> 01:51:18.820]   All right depends. I think part of the deal is whatever it is
[01:51:18.820 --> 01:51:24.060]   I mean the joke about tech TV and and Ziff Davis TV was that they couldn't get the local market
[01:51:24.060 --> 01:51:30.500]   The San Francisco market it took forever. I never did I think they ever did. Yeah. Yeah, that's a horrible business
[01:51:30.500 --> 01:51:33.340]   Yeah, well, I don't want to be a new cable channel
[01:51:33.340 --> 01:51:35.920]   I don't imagine there are very many new cable channels
[01:51:35.940 --> 01:51:41.300]   But there are a lot of people who have existing cable channels, and I wonder if they have an over-the-top future
[01:51:41.300 --> 01:51:42.940]   Or they're just gonna go away
[01:51:42.940 --> 01:51:44.940]   You know what is it like?
[01:51:44.940 --> 01:51:51.940]   Six six dollars a month or five dollars a month some of the more expensive ones or ESPN sixteen dollars for ESPN
[01:51:51.940 --> 01:51:54.460]   $16 yeah
[01:51:54.460 --> 01:51:57.860]   So that's what the cable company pays per subscriber
[01:51:57.860 --> 01:52:00.140]   to ESPN
[01:52:00.140 --> 01:52:03.500]   Horrible, that's all that's the I think the most expensive channel
[01:52:04.660 --> 01:52:09.940]   Because everybody wants to watch ESPN. That's the one people and ESPN has been pulling some stunts, too
[01:52:09.940 --> 01:52:14.980]   I mean if I'm not mistaken the national championship game for the NCAA
[01:52:14.980 --> 01:52:22.740]   Football was ESPN only if I'm not mistaken and I know that they're showing all these basketball games and by the way the brackets
[01:52:22.740 --> 01:52:27.380]   Are out showing all these basketball games on ESPN more than anyplace else
[01:52:27.380 --> 01:52:30.660]   and they did they've been pulling this off and it seems to me like a
[01:52:31.500 --> 01:52:37.220]   Horrible thing to do especially the NCAA to do a deal with a cable company when they should be on broadcast television
[01:52:37.220 --> 01:52:42.860]   Let's take a break. You could check your brackets Clayton and nut John. I already know what they are you already picked
[01:52:42.860 --> 01:52:50.380]   There's there was one guy on ESPN. I believe who picked him in advance, and he was right yeah, all right
[01:52:50.380 --> 01:52:54.380]   While we take a break when we come back. Let's talk about Hillary Clinton's email
[01:52:54.380 --> 01:52:57.220]   Or something like that
[01:52:57.220 --> 01:52:59.300]   predictable

[01:54:28.500 --> 01:54:32.160]   It's like you don't want to get a package covered with postage stamps
[01:54:32.160 --> 01:54:39.300]   Right and it was if you collect stamps like bubble wrap with with Matt with tape all around it was crazy
[01:54:39.300 --> 01:54:44.900]   It looked like a crazy person said it to me that does not put out the best most professional appearance

[01:55:32.880 --> 01:55:37.100]   You know I like them. I like this. I've looked into this operation I
[01:55:37.100 --> 01:55:41.140]   Think this is probably what they've done is they've modernized it
[01:55:41.140 --> 01:55:43.720]   Oh, you know there's yeah warehousing is not a new thing no
[01:55:43.720 --> 01:55:48.100]   There's tons of it and you can find a place that would warehouse your stuff and drop shipping and send them labels
[01:55:48.100 --> 01:55:50.380]   but Dave kid to me they've kind of
[01:55:50.380 --> 01:55:57.100]   Put themselves in a position where they've they've done that the hard part is which is the communications the orders to the right
[01:55:57.100 --> 01:56:01.980]   To it and do it all in some modern fashion because it has not been modernized even say
[01:56:01.980 --> 01:56:06.900]   Here's the package who's the best price for shipping things like that whether you would probably great way to do that up to do
[01:56:06.900 --> 01:56:08.900]   Yeah, it's really great shipstation. I
[01:56:09.580 --> 01:56:12.540]   Will be shipping books through them are you yeah? Oh good?
[01:56:12.540 --> 01:56:16.420]   Are you gonna sell your own books direct now? Yeah, why not print them?
[01:56:16.420 --> 01:56:21.860]   To you use that operation that did that Amazon has set up out in North Carolina whatever there
[01:56:21.860 --> 01:56:26.300]   And then they send you a big box of books no dude. They would send them straight to ship they do it all yeah, yeah
[01:56:26.300 --> 01:56:32.140]   That's actually I you know a publisher gives you nothing at this point that you can't do yourself
[01:56:32.140 --> 01:56:36.220]   Well depends a lot of people can't do publicity. They don't know how to do marketing. They don't know how to
[01:56:36.860 --> 01:56:41.980]   Well John is so bad at marketing, but but but actually if you think about it
[01:56:41.980 --> 01:56:46.360]   You can hire a freelance editor hire a freelance designer actually
[01:56:46.360 --> 01:56:51.180]   There's a lot of good copy editors floating around and living in the sticks because they can't get jobs in New York anymore
[01:56:51.180 --> 01:56:57.380]   And they work inexpensively they're not dirt cheap by any means you don't want to you know save too much on your copy editor
[01:56:57.380 --> 01:57:01.140]   You know so you get a copy editor you have to think they do get indexed and then everything's done
[01:57:01.140 --> 01:57:04.220]   The index is a little challenging is it oh yeah?
[01:57:04.220 --> 01:57:10.300]   That's a challenge you mean like that would be a good career for somebody is to be an indexer people that are really good at
[01:57:10.300 --> 01:57:13.460]   It oh, it's an art in indexing is they do they they yeah
[01:57:13.460 --> 01:57:17.560]   You see a lot of self-published books that have no index in the back right on this guy
[01:57:17.560 --> 01:57:23.340]   Because you couldn't deal with it you can't do the automatic systems that are computerized you can go on the web they suck
[01:57:23.340 --> 01:57:28.420]   They don't do a good job does his own indexes which I thought was kind of he does it on his own by himself
[01:57:28.420 --> 01:57:29.060]   Yeah
[01:57:29.060 --> 01:57:34.660]   But what he does uses net dragon naturally speaking so he'll go through the book and dictate the index basically
[01:57:34.660 --> 01:57:37.900]   Because that's what you have to do right is go through the text of the book and figure out
[01:57:37.900 --> 01:57:44.300]   What is a keyword yeah, that's important that for if I was gonna look it up page 51. I talk it. Yeah, isn't that clever?
[01:57:44.300 --> 01:57:51.200]   Yeah, it is an interesting yeah, yeah, I haven't given away it costs a lot of money to get for a good index
[01:57:51.200 --> 01:57:56.580]   That's why POG is who's cheap guys cheap skate. Yeah, it's well known. Yeah, well known as such
[01:57:56.980 --> 01:58:02.060]   No, I'm just kidding. I love David alright, so Hillary Clinton's email
[01:58:02.060 --> 01:58:05.880]   There's the political angle to it, and I'm sure Clayton you've talked a lot about it John
[01:58:05.880 --> 01:58:08.960]   You've talked a lot about it, but there are there is a technical angle to it
[01:58:08.960 --> 01:58:13.740]   she actually was running a Windows server in her basement Clinton email comm and
[01:58:13.740 --> 01:58:19.020]   A company called Venafil which does or venafy. I'm sorry
[01:58:19.020 --> 01:58:23.140]   Venafy trust net keeps track of
[01:58:23.140 --> 01:58:25.920]   Certificates and stuff so they have historic data
[01:58:25.920 --> 01:58:33.320]   Oh cool, so because of it they know for instance when Clinton email comm got a email certificate
[01:58:33.320 --> 01:58:36.300]   They've done digital certificate analysis
[01:58:36.300 --> 01:58:44.140]   Three digital certificates were used with Clinton email comm since 2009 those are well done, and they are good, but
[01:58:44.140 --> 01:58:46.460]   she was
[01:58:46.460 --> 01:58:50.040]   Secretary of State for three months before the server was encrypted or authenticated
[01:58:51.140 --> 01:58:57.060]   So what's interesting about this to me is that you if you read the New York Times piece this week a few days ago
[01:58:57.060 --> 01:59:04.860]   About what the State Department was doing in February they finally in February just last month finally started archiving
[01:59:04.860 --> 01:59:12.500]   emails from senior officials at the State Department so up until this point even though they had been pushed to do so since I think to about
[01:59:12.500 --> 01:59:20.520]   2012 or so the mandate came down from the Obama administration to make sure I think maybe I'm wrong
[01:59:20.520 --> 01:59:23.980]   It might be wrong on my date on the 2012 might have been in 2009
[01:59:23.980 --> 01:59:27.740]   Took them this long to actually get that adoption going at the State Department
[01:59:27.740 --> 01:59:34.140]   So turns out that everyone's crying about Hillary Clinton's email, and she kept this private server
[01:59:34.140 --> 01:59:37.460]   But it turns out and I mentioned this on the air this morning could it be possible
[01:59:37.460 --> 01:59:42.900]   That her own server is the best record of State Department communication
[01:59:42.900 --> 01:59:45.860]   That we have ironic
[01:59:45.860 --> 01:59:51.180]   Wouldn't it be and we can't subpoena because it's a personal server so whether or not Trey Gowdy and other members of Congress
[01:59:51.180 --> 01:59:54.700]   Can get their hands on it, but that may be the only record of her time
[01:59:54.700 --> 01:59:59.300]   Because she actually had her own server had she not we wouldn't have anything there be no record
[01:59:59.300 --> 02:00:02.460]   The department doesn't archive it. I think this is the smartest thing she could have done
[02:00:02.460 --> 02:00:07.000]   God knows what crazy conniving that was going on that she erased
[02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:15.420]   Smart move I actually I don't know I don't have a political opinion about it, but I do think it's interesting
[02:00:15.660 --> 02:00:17.660]   All right, I'm gonna keep it to myself. How about that?
[02:00:17.660 --> 02:00:24.740]   More honest, but I think her explanation no, I'll tell you on my opinion. Yeah, I think her explanation is credible
[02:00:24.740 --> 02:00:26.740]   She didn't want to carry two blackberries. Oh
[02:00:26.740 --> 02:00:34.940]   And the one provided by the State Department allowed one email account the everybody else was using one for private email one for public
[02:00:34.940 --> 02:00:37.220]   If you're doing that you're making a decision
[02:00:37.220 --> 02:00:44.640]   Every moment this is private. This is public this is anything that you decide is private is no longer public record
[02:00:44.980 --> 02:00:49.180]   So what's different from her doing that decision every moment of the day as she sends email?
[02:00:49.180 --> 02:00:52.800]   Then doing the decision at the end and saying here's the 30,000 emails that were
[02:00:52.800 --> 02:00:57.860]   Public that I would have used this blackberry for here's and then I'm gonna keep the 50,000
[02:00:57.860 --> 02:01:04.340]   I would use that blackberry for how is that any different you have like ten phones. It's not technically it's not technically different technically
[02:01:04.340 --> 02:01:08.580]   It sounds like exactly I understand there are transparency rules, which she's violated
[02:01:08.580 --> 02:01:14.380]   Nevertheless, it sounds like in the spirit of it. It's kind of what the same thing
[02:01:14.740 --> 02:01:18.600]   Right. You're not inhibited from having your own personal email account
[02:01:18.600 --> 02:01:23.620]   Right anybody in the federal government can and you talk to anybody who works in the federal government
[02:01:23.620 --> 02:01:29.060]   They'll tell you one of the first things you do when your orientation is signed that paper saying that your communication
[02:01:29.060 --> 02:01:35.040]   Government communication has to be to be archived and preserved has to go through the proper channels
[02:01:35.040 --> 02:01:37.780]   So the fact that she had her own private email is fine
[02:01:37.780 --> 02:01:43.300]   But and she wants to talk about yoga or the other things she mentioned she was talking about. Yeah, that's that's fine
[02:01:43.300 --> 02:01:47.700]   There is the issue and that's why I raised this issue of the certificate. There is a security issue
[02:01:47.700 --> 02:01:50.620]   mostly because
[02:01:50.620 --> 02:01:58.300]   She would be a as many have pointed out a very prime target for foreign governments and so forth because she's talking about trade
[02:01:58.300 --> 02:02:00.300]   Agreements and things like that and yeah
[02:02:00.300 --> 02:02:08.900]   US servers are also prime targets and in fact this week the State Department had to shut down its non classified email
[02:02:09.140 --> 02:02:15.580]   Because of malware right so it doesn't mean that just because it's on government property that it's any more secure point
[02:02:15.580 --> 02:02:22.240]   Exactly. I mean and look God knows we know that the NSA was snooping on members of Congress
[02:02:22.240 --> 02:02:26.920]   I mean they have everything so what by the way doesn't the NSA probably have a copy of these emails anyway
[02:02:26.920 --> 02:02:31.300]   We hope so well and that was her other point although we now know that that's not true
[02:02:31.300 --> 02:02:38.500]   Is that well I assume that everything that I was sending to government officials was being archived anyway because they were archiving it
[02:02:38.580 --> 02:02:45.780]   Right. Well interesting. All right, so there's the there's the you know ethical issue of she knew what the law was did not follow the law
[02:02:45.780 --> 02:02:48.840]   But there's there's also purely from purely practical point of view
[02:02:48.840 --> 02:02:51.340]   I don't know if she did anything that was any different that she would have done
[02:02:51.340 --> 02:02:57.000]   Just ad hoc at any moment. Well, I'm gonna send this one's personal. This one's private
[02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:59.200]   She had to make those decisions at every step of the way
[02:02:59.200 --> 02:03:04.800]   So has anyone done an interview or found the guy who ran it? I know I love the famous
[02:03:04.860 --> 02:03:08.780]   He's yeah, I know that his name was not correct. I shot him. His name was Netanyahu
[02:03:08.780 --> 02:03:13.280]   Oh, I don't know. No, the name was not correct on the documents
[02:03:13.280 --> 02:03:16.800]   They were initially released and then later he was determined who he was
[02:03:16.800 --> 02:03:22.140]   But I would love to talk to him and find out what how it was set up and what kind of security
[02:03:22.140 --> 02:03:26.120]   Was in place and you're not alone in that I'm sure some guy named Ben
[02:03:26.120 --> 02:03:33.820]   Jason they had to barely had two Secret Service people watching the server really? Yeah
[02:03:33.820 --> 02:03:37.340]   What you could service watching or what you know, cuz they watch your house
[02:03:37.340 --> 02:03:42.620]   She says yeah, but she like detail some people to go in the basement and watch the server and stare at it
[02:03:42.620 --> 02:03:45.260]   Just stare at it. Watch the blinking lights
[02:03:45.260 --> 02:03:50.700]   It'd be a great great maybe she knew that the State Department wasn't all that secure and said I know how to do it better
[02:03:50.700 --> 02:03:53.380]   but again
[02:03:53.380 --> 02:03:57.500]   4chan
[02:03:57.500 --> 02:03:59.700]   Christopher pool better known as moot is
[02:04:00.860 --> 02:04:03.820]   Walking away from 4chan 4chan is an amazing story
[02:04:03.820 --> 02:04:09.920]   He was a teenager when he created this high school student in upstate New York 11 years ago when he created
[02:04:09.920 --> 02:04:12.820]   4chan as a forum
[02:04:12.820 --> 02:04:18.820]   Unfortunately 4chan became a cesspool because it was wide open and
[02:04:18.820 --> 02:04:23.620]   Eventually got a lot of heat for the fappening and gamer gate
[02:04:23.620 --> 02:04:29.260]   If you don't know what those are children go to a lot your local library and look it up. Look it up on Google
[02:04:29.700 --> 02:04:36.920]   No, no, no go to your local library. They're sure to have information. Ask a librarian. Tell me about the fappening
[02:04:36.920 --> 02:04:38.920]   What is the fappening? I?
[02:04:38.920 --> 02:04:41.100]   Have an assignment
[02:04:41.100 --> 02:04:51.920]   20 million unique visitors a month 40 billion page views in 11 years one of the most widely visited websites of all time
[02:04:51.920 --> 02:04:58.540]   Moot is now 27 and he says I've had enough. He's walking away in
[02:04:59.460 --> 02:05:06.900]   2009 he was number one on Times poll as the world's most influential person beating out President Obama Oprah Wimfy and the Dalai Lama
[02:05:06.900 --> 02:05:12.100]   but that was only because that was remember that was the fan vote and
[02:05:12.100 --> 02:05:15.740]   That was the power of 4chan my hand and bots
[02:05:15.740 --> 02:05:21.680]   In fact, didn't they didn't they do something wild with the vote so they made the first letters of each name spell
[02:05:21.680 --> 02:05:23.900]   What was it Chris? I?
[02:05:23.900 --> 02:05:27.660]   Can't remember you obviously said a lot of time in slash B B slash B
[02:05:28.340 --> 02:05:30.340]   something about cake
[02:05:30.340 --> 02:05:38.140]   These guys they're wild he wrote I've come to represent an uncomfortably large single point of failure
[02:05:38.140 --> 02:05:44.920]   His 4chan has given me some amount of notoriety, but certainly it hasn't provided me with wealth
[02:05:44.920 --> 02:05:49.620]   He never was able to sell advertising. In fact, he was not so long ago
[02:05:49.620 --> 02:05:52.900]   $20,000 in debt and had moved back in with his mother
[02:05:55.420 --> 02:05:59.080]   So I can't I can't blame moot for dropping out
[02:05:59.080 --> 02:06:06.460]   So what happens to the site? That's a good question. I'm sure he's trying to sell it Condi Nast will probably right
[02:06:06.460 --> 02:06:12.460]   Yeah, pair it with reddit combined with reddit. Yeah, Condi. It's a good fit or aol aol
[02:06:12.460 --> 02:06:23.500]   Or mere cat Chris Chris knows because obviously Chris as a 17 year old spending too much time in slash B slash and
[02:06:24.220 --> 02:06:27.940]   He says they he left it to a team of administrators. They're just gonna keep running it
[02:06:27.940 --> 02:06:33.460]   Do you go into it you go to 4chan your parents know you're there. Yeah
[02:06:33.460 --> 02:06:39.860]   He was in high school when he created
[02:06:39.860 --> 02:06:44.980]   Kind of an amazing story the end of an era. I don't know what Chris pool will do
[02:06:44.980 --> 02:06:48.300]   But you know what that's a smart kid and he's great. I've talked to him. He's a smart kid
[02:06:48.300 --> 02:06:51.980]   He's bright and he's nice and somebody should hire him and give him a real job
[02:06:52.460 --> 02:06:55.660]   Maybe Yahoo will buy it like they bought time. Yeah
[02:06:55.660 --> 02:07:02.180]   There's a good gag. Yeah, it's gonna go far once Yahoo gets ahold of it. That's right
[02:07:02.180 --> 02:07:06.460]   Best way to hide what's going on on 4chan give it to Yahoo
[02:07:06.460 --> 02:07:14.740]   All right giga-ohm are you sad about what happened? Do you know what happened to you? Of course, I mean you do I know what really happened
[02:07:14.740 --> 02:07:17.080]   Well, I think we do now suspicious. I don't know
[02:07:17.080 --> 02:07:22.200]   I think we do now because Matthew Ingram has given a number of interviews most recently as you
[02:07:22.240 --> 02:07:25.580]   Sounds to me. I've read his stuff. It doesn't sound to me that he actually knows
[02:07:25.580 --> 02:07:29.580]   So four hundred thousand dollars for rent a month
[02:07:29.580 --> 02:07:35.400]   Yeah, I can tell you she was some probably that's all I think you just said it right there right there
[02:07:35.400 --> 02:07:41.840]   That's the problem bad decisions. And the thing is they got twenty three million dollars in venture capital
[02:07:41.840 --> 02:07:47.680]   But they were still borrowing money from Silicon Valley Bank because they had like rent of
[02:07:48.680 --> 02:07:53.160]   Their own through money. So they would they yeah, they ran out of money and the banks
[02:07:53.160 --> 02:07:59.060]   It wasn't the venture capitalists venture capitalists in this respect had a little bit more patience than the banks banks have no patience
[02:07:59.060 --> 02:08:01.720]   They pushed out the CEO
[02:08:01.720 --> 02:08:05.560]   They brought on an executive from a Dow Jones
[02:08:05.560 --> 02:08:08.600]   Let the company more money
[02:08:08.600 --> 02:08:14.040]   Borrowed more money and eventually the creditors said man, that's enough. What's the value of giga-ohm?
[02:08:14.040 --> 02:08:19.400]   I mean virtually nothing from what I can what Ingram said and I believe this is true that it was net the
[02:08:19.400 --> 02:08:23.840]   Problem was never the editorial side. That was a profit. It's a very profitable editorial side
[02:08:23.840 --> 02:08:27.840]   It was their decision to do so they decided to do three things which is
[02:08:27.840 --> 02:08:34.920]   Trade shows which tech crunch did quite well and made a lot of understanding is that the research was the number research arm was there?
[02:08:34.920 --> 02:08:37.640]   No, no, no, this is just the opposite of what I've read
[02:08:37.640 --> 02:08:38.360]   All right
[02:08:38.360 --> 02:08:45.200]   The research arm is the one that had the potential to be profitable the the trade show thing was pretty was doing well
[02:08:45.200 --> 02:08:47.400]   And it was the editorial that was losing all the money
[02:08:47.400 --> 02:08:52.240]   Of course, Matthew's part of the editorial. So he just secret he thinks it's right. It's not
[02:08:52.240 --> 02:08:56.440]   There's about seven or eight articles out floating around. Yeah, this is interesting
[02:08:56.440 --> 02:09:01.240]   They're all the recode article the recode article that you were looking at Leo says
[02:09:01.240 --> 02:09:06.840]   That it was the research arm that was dragging them down. Yeah, that's from Matthew's interview. Yeah, so
[02:09:07.960 --> 02:09:11.920]   I think the only reason I bring it up. It doesn't mean it's the end of the line for
[02:09:11.920 --> 02:09:17.400]   Tech journalism or tech logs the end is it the end is near Leo. Oh crap
[02:09:17.400 --> 02:09:24.440]   So we shouldn't project from this should we this is an incident these things happen and they didn't get enough money
[02:09:24.440 --> 02:09:29.720]   I think that the operation was a book of vox. They've got like 200 million. Yeah, they're doing alright
[02:09:29.720 --> 02:09:35.280]   Yeah, so giga ohm and we love ohm Malik who's been on the show many times and I hope we'll come back
[02:09:35.720 --> 02:09:40.720]   He's in mourning right now poor guy. I think it was a really devastating blow to him and some of the best
[02:09:40.720 --> 02:09:43.720]   I'm sure last one. He left a year ago, but it's still his
[02:09:43.720 --> 02:09:51.960]   Right, that's my question. What's the value was it in his voice? I don't think so. I really had really good people state the Stacey Higginbotham
[02:09:51.960 --> 02:09:57.420]   Janko records Matthew Ingram many of whom have been on Kevin Toffle
[02:09:57.420 --> 02:10:04.640]   These are great journalists who've been on our shows many many times all out of work like that and Ingram said we had no inkling
[02:10:04.880 --> 02:10:10.120]   Yeah, I love I love my take on Chrome and he did it, you know, he was always out in front on
[02:10:10.120 --> 02:10:15.080]   Yeah Chromebook. Yeah in Chrome OS. I really enjoyed his pieces, you know, I have to say
[02:10:15.080 --> 02:10:20.560]   I'm curious now the future because this kept happening right after Apple events. We saw what happened with Macworld, right?
[02:10:20.560 --> 02:10:23.520]   literally that afternoon I'm flying home and I see
[02:10:23.520 --> 02:10:29.540]   Jason Snell tweeting that he's out of a job and I you know, I couldn't believe it and then then this happens
[02:10:29.540 --> 02:10:32.760]   We're all sitting there was sitting with Renee Richie and Serenity Caldwell
[02:10:32.760 --> 02:10:34.760]   we're enjoying a post show cocktail and
[02:10:34.760 --> 02:10:41.760]   Serenity says holy cow giga-home just done. Yeah gone. What what, you know, we couldn't believe it right after the event
[02:10:41.760 --> 02:10:44.400]   Well, and Kevin Toffle had filed his story about the Apple watch
[02:10:44.400 --> 02:10:47.880]   He was at the event right went back and they didn't tell him and it was over
[02:10:47.880 --> 02:10:51.320]   That was the last article posted. So my question is given this
[02:10:51.320 --> 02:10:54.800]   Given these circumstances who's next?
[02:10:54.800 --> 02:10:58.560]   Well, we have to wait to the next Apple event, right?
[02:10:59.360 --> 02:11:04.200]   You mentioned tech crunch. I mean is this style? Well, they're owned by a well at this point
[02:11:04.200 --> 02:11:10.120]   They're probably all right, right? I mean aol. Well, I don't know maybe not. Yeah, it's got to be an independent operation that goes
[02:11:10.120 --> 02:11:15.480]   Like I am proud to say I take I've taken no venture funding or borrowed
[02:11:15.480 --> 02:11:20.680]   Well, we did borrow to build a studio. We would pay that off already. So we have no debtors. Yeah, you're in good shape
[02:11:20.680 --> 02:11:27.300]   You got no debt is $400,000 a month though. You're rolling in dough. You're rolling in dough literally
[02:11:27.840 --> 02:11:32.560]   You can buy $8,000 lenses with just a over that was a mistake a
[02:11:32.560 --> 02:11:35.920]   Mistake you're rolling in dough
[02:11:35.920 --> 02:11:42.240]   I'm gonna wrap it up on that fine upbeat note. It is upbeat and is upbeat
[02:11:42.240 --> 02:11:49.360]   But you know, we don't you know, it's I don't want people to think I'm a 1% or anything you are a 1%
[02:11:49.360 --> 02:11:55.160]   No, because then they know because that no you are a total 1% or I'm glad to know you as such
[02:11:56.360 --> 02:12:01.240]   It's great to look up and see somebody like you Leo up there at the top of the hill
[02:12:01.240 --> 02:12:06.680]   You're a slumlord. My god, you own houses all over Berkeley. No, I don't
[02:12:06.680 --> 02:12:10.720]   Anyway, hey, it's always a lot of fun John. You're the best

[02:13:33.840 --> 02:13:35.840]   You know firing people is hard
