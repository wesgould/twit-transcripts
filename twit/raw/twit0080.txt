[00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.120]   Ah, here we are ready to twit again.
[00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.680]   We took a little time off to look our wounds,
[00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.560]   but back on track for the 18th,
[00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.560]   JohnC.vorak.org/blog.

[00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.840]   Last time we talked you were in the basement getting your furnace fixed,
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.240]   but I take it all as well.
[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.800]   Actually no.
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:18.880]   No?
[00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.520]   Well no.
[00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.200]   They needed to get apart.
[00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.480]   Yeah, we had that happen too.
[00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.200]   Why is it the furnace never works when it's the coldest?
[00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.360]   Steve Gibson, you've heard his voice before on security now.
[00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.080]   He is the guy who actually got Devorak to declare,
[00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.240]   "I get no spam."
[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.240]   And so we thought we'd bring him back to see if he could bait the bear one more time.
[00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.320]   Or maybe just discuss what happened this week.
[00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.240]   Yeah, well that too.
[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.160]   David Prager from Revision3.com.
[00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.160]   Greetings.
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.160]   And David's one of the original Twits.
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.160]   In fact, the only one on this panel, besides me,
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.560]   I started almost in the only one that's going to be the one year anniversary now of the...
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.120]   The two year anniversary of Mackerel.
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.120]   Is it two years?
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.120]   Yeah.
[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.120]   Oh my God.
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.120]   Is it really?
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.120]   No, it's...
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.120]   Because it was...
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.920]   No, it was Mackerel not the most reason, but the one before that,
[00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.000]   where we were at the 21st Amendment I think.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.360]   Yumi, Patrick, Kevin, was Roger there?
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.360]   You're right, it was.
[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.360]   It was 2005.
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.360]   Well if Roger was there...
[00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.400]   If this is show number 80...
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.400]   Okay, you're right.
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.400]   Okay.
[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.400]   How could it be two years?
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.880]   Well, because we didn't do...
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.880]   We did the first one in January and then...
[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.240]   You can call it the pilot episode.
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.240]   That was the episode zero.
[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.440]   And then you skipped 22 shows.
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.400]   No, and then we didn't start till April.
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.400]   Okay.
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.520]   So we had a pilot and you weren't there for that, but you came in and show eight or something.
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.400]   You've been along since the right.
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:45.000]   And also here, Kevin Prewell, formerly with the microprocessor report, he is now at NVIDIA,
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.200]   but he says he can be objective when it comes to talking about ATI.
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.200]   And we're going to talk.
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.440]   You know, and I feel left out, I have to get my own websites on day.
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:57.920]   You don't have a website?
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.560]   I know, I am so pathetic.
[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.440]   What the hell am I going to plug?
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.440]   What should I plug?
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.440]   Oh, buy NVIDIA, everybody.
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.440]   Now you can plug Devorak.org/blog.
[00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.440]   I'm a machine.
[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.360]   Are we supposed to do a shot after he says that?
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.360]   Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.360]   Drinking.
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.360]   No, no, no.
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.360]   I believe we are not supposed to.
[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.360]   This isn't dignity.
[00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.360]   No.
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.680]   We're supposed to stay here sober while everyone around us is losing their pool.
[00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.280]   So the big story of the week, which just came out a few hours before we convened this,
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:31.600]   time magazine has declared, the person of the year, ladies and gentlemen, is you.
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:32.600]   No, not you, John.
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.440]   No, no, no, not you, Steve.
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:41.840]   No, you, the other you, not, yeah, that you, I thought we should maybe say it's you's guys.
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.520]   You guys, the listening audience.
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.760]   But you know what, that's assuming that there's no digital divide.
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.160]   I would just keep thinking if time's goal is the...
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.160]   You really, that's true.
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.360]   Is it the event of the year for the six billion people on the planet or is it...
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.280]   I still think it's a fantastic selection, though, right?
[00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.840]   It's a fantastic idea.
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:58.840]   Yeah, I think it.
[00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.200]   Well, let me, let me, let me, you guys can debate this in a second.
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.240]   Let me just explain what they're talking about.
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.760]   They're talking about user generated content.
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.280]   The subtitle is yes, you, you, this is a little bit like a commercial.
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.160]   Yes, you, you control the information age.
[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.160]   Welcome to your world.
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.440]   I thought they controlled the horizontal.
[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.000]   You control the vertical.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.920]   Lev Grossman writing this, he says, oh, he pulls up Thomas Carlisle.
[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.800]   That's, this is typical time magazine overheated prose, but eventually says that it's not the
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.960]   great man who makes the difference in the world today.
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.360]   Our collective destiny is shaped by all of us.
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:42.680]   Blogs, Wikipedia, he uses as an example, YouTube, MySpace.
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:47.720]   He's saying the fact that we're reviewing books on Amazon.com and getting together in
[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:48.720]   Second Life.
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:49.720]   This is web 2.0.
[00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.440]   It's, it's about social networking.
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.400]   Hey, David works for revision three, which is a dig.
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.520]   I think dig is a very, I don't, they didn't mention dig, but dig is a very good example
[00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.920]   of the you they're talking about.
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:00.920]   Oh, you know what it is?
[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:02.120]   These guys wimped out.
[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.280]   They couldn't figure out who to make person of the year.
[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:05.840]   They were worried sick.
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.120]   They'd offend somebody because it appeared that it was either going to be Kim Jong-il
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.680]   or that guy in Iran because those are the guys that have been making the most noise.
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.720]   And so for political correctness, they came up with this bogus choice.
[00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:21.240]   This is the same thing that happened when they picked the computer as the person of
[00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.320]   the year because they wouldn't give it to Steve Jobs because they didn't like him.
[00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.000]   I didn't find this to be a good choice.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.480]   I find it to be a cop out.
[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:28.840]   I find it to be a sellout.
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:29.840]   It's ridiculous.
[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.000]   Besides, you can't have a person of the year that nobody can pronounce.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.440]   If it's Mahmoud, I'm a head and a daddy.
[00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.200]   Well, what do you, you know, you can't say it.
[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:37.200]   I'm a dead a job.
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.200]   I'm a dead a man.
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.640]   That's not going to work.
[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:43.440]   So do you think the PC was a cop out because they wanted to give it to Jobs?
[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:44.680]   I thought they did give it to Jobs.
[00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:45.680]   They never gave it to Jobs.
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.760]   No, it was on this show where Wozni expelled the beans on that story.
[00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:50.760]   That's right.
[00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:54.840]   It was again to go to Jobs and they found him to beat such a jerk that they had to do something
[00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:55.840]   at the last minute.
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.360]   And I think this is the same situation here.
[00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.200]   Hitler has been the man person of the year on Time magazine.
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:05.720]   If they think Jobs is too much of a jerk to be on the cover, I'm worried.
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.200]   I like the editorial staff.
[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:09.720]   Yeah, the editorial staff changes over the years.
[00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:12.320]   So the guys who liked Hitler may have picked Steve Jobs.
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:13.320]   I don't think they liked it.
[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.960]   But the point of the person of the year is it's the most significant, not necessarily
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:16.960]   the mysis.
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:21.000]   Well, I also think that the editors at Time are obviously thinking that they could combine
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.480]   things like the YouTube sale and things like what MySpace has become.
[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.920]   And they want to combine those types of things into one store.
[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:30.040]   Amber thought it was going to be Steve and Chad, the guys who founded YouTube.
[00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.600]   I think it totally makes sense though.
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:36.200]   I mean, it's just one week out of Time's 52 issues.
[00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:41.120]   And in order to point out the fact that this is happening, I mean, there is something going
[00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:42.120]   on.
[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:46.240]   It's sort of phenomenal that Wikipedia is turned out to be as high quality as it is
[00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.240]   and as useful as it is.
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:53.360]   And the point is there's this massive people scattered all over the planet who are all
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:59.120]   contributing little bits in various sorts of structures which have been created to organize
[00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:00.120]   all those little bits.
[00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:01.120]   Oh, this is...
[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.600]   This is a bunch of bull.
[00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:05.160]   Why didn't they give this thing to the internal combustion engine?
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:06.960]   Why didn't they give it to like...
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:07.960]   Why didn't they give it to like...
[00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:08.960]   You mean now?
[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:09.960]   You mean that...
[00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:10.960]   But the first...
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:11.960]   But Nick, I mean, come on.
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:12.960]   John, I mean...
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:13.960]   John, give it to...
[00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:14.960]   John, the first of the year can't be a construct.
[00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:15.960]   Okay.
[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:19.280]   So a bunch of times they did a whistle blowers even.
[00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:20.280]   It's not the first time.
[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:21.280]   Do that.
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:24.640]   Give up on the fact that they're calling it person of the year and just call it, you know,
[00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:25.640]   thing...
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:26.640]   Why don't they change the...
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:29.360]   They're the ones who call it person of the year, not me.
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:30.360]   Kevin...
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:31.360]   There's a legacy there.
[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:32.360]   And I think that's...
[00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:33.840]   You know, it's one of those things where you're stuck.
[00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:34.840]   You call person of the year.
[00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:40.200]   If you change it, you sort of change the historical legacy of the event and the issue.
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.440]   So they picked some people who are important.
[00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:46.360]   These are the 15 citizens of the new digital democracy.
[00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:47.360]   Shall we run through them so, John?
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:48.360]   These are people...
[00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:51.600]   Yeah, and that's why before they run through them, let me warn everybody out there that
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:57.280]   this is a random selection of just 15 people that they came up with while it's sitting
[00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:01.280]   around in a meeting, you know, short of blowing their brains out because they couldn't find
[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:03.560]   anyone with a nerve to put on the cover.
[00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:04.560]   Well, number one...
[00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:06.360]   They had to pick three people last year.
[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:07.360]   Yeah, with Steve.
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:09.920]   I mean, Bill and Melinda and Bono, right?
[00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:10.920]   Yeah.
[00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:13.560]   It just means they're having a hard and hard time coming to a...
[00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:16.200]   And in 2003, it was the American soldier.
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:18.400]   Hey, Steve, just say before that it was whistle-blowers.
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:21.280]   They've done bunches at times where they pick an object...
[00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:22.280]   Constructs.
[00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:23.280]   Yeah.
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:24.280]   That's because they can't...
[00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:26.080]   This is turned into a spineless operation.
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:28.360]   In 1993, it was the peacemaker.
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:31.760]   It probably should be Mahmoud A, say it again, Steve, because I can't say it.
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:32.760]   Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.
[00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:33.760]   Ahmadinejad.
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:34.760]   I guess he can't even.
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:35.760]   Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:38.160]   You watch more CNN than the rest of us put down.
[00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:39.160]   Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.
[00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:40.160]   Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:41.160]   Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.
[00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:42.160]   Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.
[00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:45.400]   In 1988, it was the endangered Earth.
[00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:46.960]   It sounds like they can get that again.
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:47.960]   Alright, John.
[00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:50.120]   Let's declare our person of the year.
[00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:51.400]   Who would you put on that list?
[00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:52.760]   It's got to be tech, obviously.
[00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:55.760]   Oh, you mean on the 15 and a list of...
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:58.440]   The twit person of the year.
[00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:00.000]   Why'd that be you, Leo?
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.680]   Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is my vote.
[00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:09.560]   So Layla, the real lonely girl 15, is one of the top 15 people.
[00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:11.800]   She should be number 15 on the list, really.
[00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:13.960]   Yeah, but she wasn't really one of us.
[00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:15.200]   She was an actress.
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:16.920]   She was a plant.
[00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:19.920]   Lane Hudson, the Washington whistleblower.
[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:24.800]   He's the guy who got Mark Foley fired.
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:26.040]   You know, I never heard of this guy.
[00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:27.600]   I didn't either, and I guess he's got a blog.
[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.960]   But it just, you know, it's, well, here's a blog.
[00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:38.440]   Ali Khashid, who is another blogger, a Pakistani blogger.
[00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:39.760]   These are getting weirder and weirder.
[00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:40.760]   Let's keep going.
[00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:44.880]   How come they don't name like the guys who do, you know, like Tim O'Reilly or something.
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:46.880]   I mean, people that are actually instrumental in this stuff.
[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:47.880]   Because they don't know that aspect.
[00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:48.880]   They know they're my own.
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:49.880]   That's because they don't know that aspect.
[00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:50.880]   They don't know.
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:55.200]   Here's a 22 year old senior at the University of Portland, Megan Gill.
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:58.480]   Apparently she's in here because she has 708 friends in her Facebook.
[00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:00.480]   I don't understand.
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:02.160]   This is just, maybe these are just, you're right.
[00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:03.360]   This is a random sampling.
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:05.160]   I don't understand it.
[00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:08.320]   Lee Kelly, who's a, a soldier blogger.
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:09.880]   One of the, one of many actually.
[00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:11.600]   Yeah, look where they stuck in.
[00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:12.600]   Yeah.
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:13.600]   Salt Lake.
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:14.600]   Salt Lake.
[00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:16.400]   You won't be blogging much here, boy.
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:18.200]   Oh yeah.
[00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:22.440]   This is our Siddharth, the accidental assassin, a senior at the University of Virginia became
[00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:27.600]   famous when Virginia Senator George Allen referred to him as Makaka.
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:28.600]   Right.
[00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:29.600]   Remember that one?
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:30.600]   Oh yeah.
[00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:31.680]   This one on the dinner night.
[00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:32.680]   Not so good.
[00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:35.640]   The guy standing there holding a camera for the competition and now he's one of the top
[00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:36.640]   15.
[00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:37.640]   Yeah.
[00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:38.640]   Okay.
[00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:39.640]   Warren, yeah, that's a good point.
[00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:40.640]   Newsweek camera.
[00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:45.480]   Warren Murray and Leanne White host of the cooking podcast called Crash Test Kitchen from
[00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:46.800]   Queensland, Australia.
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:48.040]   We should have been on this list.
[00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:53.120]   Well, I agree that these things are all relatively arbitrary, but they're instances
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:57.160]   of people who are participating in this man of the year, Stu.
[00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:58.160]   How about this?
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:10:59.160]   Time magazine.
[00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:00.160]   Harry, I think Stu is the right word.
[00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.440]   Stu, Harriet Klausner would be the lump of beef.
[00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:06.640]   She is the number one Amazon book reviewer.
[00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:07.640]   I don't know.
[00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:08.840]   Number one, because she has the most reviews.
[00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:09.840]   Yeah.
[00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:10.840]   12, get this.
[00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:11.840]   How good can these reviews be?
[00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:15.280]   She's written 12,896 reviews.
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:16.280]   Wow.
[00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:17.880]   They can read that much.
[00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:20.120]   She said, I mean, that's a book a day for 35 years.
[00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:23.080]   How could she be reviewing these?
[00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:24.320]   I think you nailed it.
[00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:25.320]   Wow.
[00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:26.320]   What do you call it?
[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:27.320]   Go ahead.
[00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:28.320]   I'm just saying.
[00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:30.080]   I mean, they should probably be calling people on this stuff rather than praising.
[00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:31.880]   I agree with you.
[00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:34.120]   Here's a website that gets 12,000 visitors a day.
[00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:36.040]   Of course, it is in China.
[00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:39.160]   It's a Simpson site in China.
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:42.080]   Wang Xiaofeng is a fan of the Simpsons.
[00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:46.440]   He gives himself the Bart Simpson of China.
[00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:47.600]   I don't know how these guys are.
[00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:48.600]   There's a distinction.
[00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:49.600]   Wow.
[00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:51.400]   Teela Tequila, the Madonna of my space.
[00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:52.960]   Oh, hold on.
[00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:53.960]   Hello.
[00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:54.960]   Hello, Teela.
[00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:57.200]   I don't know what her--
[00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:59.000]   And I'm sure that's a real name.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   Teela.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   Hi, there it is.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   Teela.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   In the UN.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   How do you say that?
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   Oh.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   Julian, I think.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   You can't say it.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   There's no one in English can say it.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.680]   Smosh the entertain.
[00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:11.680]   This is ridiculous.
[00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:12.680]   I can't go on.
[00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:13.680]   I'm sorry about that.
[00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:14.680]   I'm not going to go on.
[00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:15.680]   They're just arbitrary.
[00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:22.080]   They're smosh the entertainers, some sort of YouTube video that they uploaded that
[00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:23.080]   nobody--
[00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:24.080]   I don't ever--
[00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:26.520]   People on YouTube who have a million downloads, who are these guys?
[00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:27.520]   Well, wait a minute.
[00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:28.520]   This is--
[00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:29.520]   17 million views.
[00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:30.520]   OK.
[00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:32.000]   It's the most watched video on YouTube.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.080]   That's got to scare people like NBC when they see one video on YouTube with 17 million
[00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:37.080]   views.
[00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:38.080]   What was it?
[00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:39.080]   What was it?
[00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:40.080]   What was the video?
[00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:41.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:42.080]   Yeah.
[00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:43.080]   See it.
[00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:44.080]   High praise.
[00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:45.080]   High praise.
[00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:46.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:48.080]   High magazine nailed this one.
[00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:49.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:50.080]   I'm Aaron Sorkin.
[00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:51.680]   I'm just trembling in my boots here.
[00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:53.600]   These people are going to beat us.
[00:12:53.600 --> 00:13:00.920]   Kamini, Kamini, he's a French rapper from a small town in France.
[00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:04.080]   And that's-- I guess he's maybe become famous on the internet.
[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:06.520]   I'm guessing.
[00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:08.680]   And Simon Pulsa for the Duke of Data.
[00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:10.680]   He's Wikipedia's busiest contributor.
[00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:12.720]   Here's another guy to go along with this woman.
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:18.800]   This 25-year-old Ottawa Brainiac has written, get this, "3,000 entries to Wikipedia," and
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:20.720]   edited 80,000 others.
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:22.920]   And he's 25 and unemployed.
[00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:23.920]   What does he do?
[00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:25.440]   He writes in Wikipedia all day.
[00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:27.360]   Got his photos classic.
[00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:28.360]   I know.
[00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:29.360]   I know.
[00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:30.360]   I know.
[00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:31.360]   I'm a kick-a-reedy editor.
[00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:37.120]   What's funny is if you read the thing above, it says, "Simon Pulsa verblabla has edited
[00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:38.120]   nearly 80,000 others."
[00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:42.440]   Then you go down to the story and it says, and he's edited roughly 92,000 others.
[00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:44.280]   These guys can't even get--
[00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:45.280]   He's been back.
[00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:47.720]   --either did 12,000 before they could get to that paragraph.
[00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:51.840]   But these guys can't even edit their own copy to reflect the facts that they put in
[00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:52.840]   there.
[00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:54.080]   It's unbelievable.
[00:13:54.080 --> 00:14:02.240]   How about a 45-year-old Korean housewife who is a reporter for "Oh My News"?
[00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:04.240]   Kim Heya.
[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:09.040]   "Oh My News" is a Korean gossip brag.
[00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:10.720]   "Oh My News" is huge, by the way.
[00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:11.720]   Is it?
[00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:12.720]   I've never seen it.
[00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:13.720]   Yeah, they should have had the publisher on instead of this woman.
[00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:14.720]   That would have been better.
[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:15.720]   Blake Ross.
[00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:19.280]   Well, you understand, though, that the point is just to flesh out you.
[00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:20.280]   Yeah, I know.
[00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:26.720]   It's just a characterise, the idea that there's all these random people who are now actually
[00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:29.640]   participating in something that is happening.
[00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:30.640]   Emphasis on random.
[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:31.640]   Yeah, well, that's true.
[00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:35.600]   And wait a minute, though, if you're going to stick with that theme, why, all of a sudden,
[00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:41.200]   you come up with Blake Ross, who's actually an important person, who then why don't you
[00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:45.680]   have other really important people that instead of you have a bunch of random people, one guy
[00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:47.520]   who really means something.
[00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:52.160]   I mean, this has just come bubbledated this whole...
[00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:54.680]   I need this to say I'm not pleased with this.
[00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:57.400]   Not that I was going to be person in the future.
[00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:58.400]   Yeah, just tell you.
[00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:00.240]   I just tell us.
[00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:02.680]   You know, it's just Time Magazine.
[00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:07.080]   You wonder why the online world is killing the print guys when you have to do this kind
[00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:08.080]   of thing.
[00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:09.080]   Bad daddy.
[00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:10.080]   Well, but also consider the audience.
[00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:13.880]   I mean, this is the sort of pabblem that Time Magazine's audience wants.
[00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:14.880]   Yeah.
[00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:15.880]   I'm not sure that's true.
[00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:17.720]   So Michael Slater, who used to found...
[00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:18.720]   Speaking of people...
[00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:20.840]   Now, there are some people we should maybe celebrate.
[00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:22.000]   Michael Slater, who founded the Micro...
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.520]   Or was one of the early people in the Microprocessor report.
[00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:25.520]   He's a founder.
[00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:26.520]   He's a founder, okay.
[00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:27.520]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:28.520]   Great guy.
[00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:29.520]   Really like him.
[00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:30.520]   Oh.
[00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:31.520]   Yeah.
[00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:32.520]   What's he doing, Kevin?
[00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:36.680]   Well, actually he's been real secretive about what he's actually doing, but he set up his
[00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:39.880]   own company.
[00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:42.680]   When he left Microprocessor report, he started a...
[00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:49.960]   Not web, but a software company that made software for photos and it became Adobe album.
[00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:51.600]   Oh, I didn't know that.
[00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:52.600]   Adobe bought them.
[00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:53.600]   Yeah.
[00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:55.680]   So he worked for Adobe for about, I have five or six years now.
[00:15:55.680 --> 00:16:00.160]   And then he just recently left there and it started his own little company.
[00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:03.280]   And it's the classic 2.0 kind of company.
[00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:06.760]   He's kind of building it on his own using Ruby on Rails.
[00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:08.080]   So is...
[00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:09.920]   It's a secret you say that's going on there?
[00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:10.920]   Yeah.
[00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:13.000]   Maybe, hey, hey, David, maybe you could help us.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.560]   He's good at secrets.
[00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:15.560]   Wow.
[00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:16.560]   Wow.
[00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:18.960]   Hey, I didn't say anything, did I?
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:20.960]   No, you kept it.
[00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:21.960]   No.
[00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:23.960]   Yeah, but Michael's reinventing himself.
[00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:28.960]   That's the cool thing he's got is blog@emslator.com.
[00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:31.320]   How old is he now?
[00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:33.120]   I don't know actually.
[00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:35.280]   About the same age as you.
[00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:36.280]   Yeah.
[00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:37.280]   Did you...
[00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:38.280]   You took his place kind of Kevin at...
[00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:39.280]   Was that right at Microprocessor reporter?
[00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:40.280]   There was so many...
[00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:41.280]   No, he was...
[00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:42.280]   No, no, it was actually a few people in between.
[00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:43.280]   Oh, yeah.
[00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:45.880]   He left in about 2000 and then we went through...
[00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:50.360]   We've gone through a number of editors in chief, Keith Diefendorf and Peter Glaskowski
[00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:51.360]   and then Miss Hill.
[00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:52.360]   Oh, yeah, I remember Peter, yeah.
[00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:58.840]   All right, moving on, speaking of web 2.0 and mainstream media, New York Times is now
[00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:04.520]   putting links, those little clickables to dig and newsvine on their stories.
[00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:06.840]   Who'd ever thought that had happened?
[00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:12.440]   They obviously want some publicity in newsvine and dig and Facebook.
[00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:13.440]   Yeah.
[00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:14.440]   Now that is interesting.
[00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:16.840]   Yeah, you know, that was started.
[00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:17.840]   Once...
[00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:21.720]   Market Watch is the first one of those major public operations that started doing that.
[00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:24.600]   And then I noticed it was like a cascade effect everybody was doing.
[00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:28.600]   It's a acknowledgement really of how important these other sites are to drive traffic.
[00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:29.600]   No?
[00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:30.600]   That's it.
[00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:31.600]   Yeah, no, absolutely.
[00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:36.440]   Yeah, I mean, that's the whole thing, is driving traffic to your website now.
[00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:39.480]   Times is also using Google Maps for features now.
[00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:41.120]   I mean, I think that the smart...
[00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:45.920]   This is an example of the smart mainstream media is buying in.
[00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:47.400]   They're making it to be a part of it.
[00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:49.040]   I wonder how much they're buying.
[00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:50.040]   New York 2.0?
[00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:51.040]   Yeah, maybe.
[00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:52.320]   They're buying it in at the top.
[00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:58.080]   I mean, they've also at the New York Times, they've standardized on WordPress for all
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:17:59.080]   their little...
[00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:00.080]   Really?
[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:03.680]   Yeah, if you go to like Deal Book or any of these blogs that they've sent out...
[00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:04.680]   I think that's fantastic.
[00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:06.160]   Yeah, it's all WordPress.
[00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:09.000]   Because normally you'd get a big company like this, the Gray Lady.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.840]   And Ziff Davis is an example where they use these massive content management systems
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:16.320]   like Vignette that are not user friendly.
[00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:18.720]   They're stupid.
[00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:20.640]   Why not use off the shelf software like WordPress?
[00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:22.320]   It really does the job, done is free.
[00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:25.920]   Yeah, and we had Matt Mullenwig on cranky geese recently.
[00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:28.960]   I asked him who did WordPress.
[00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:35.320]   And I asked him specifically about how much of abuse the database that he's set up using
[00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:37.000]   MySQL can handle.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:42.360]   And he cited a couple of sites with so 50 million entries and stuff like that.
[00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:45.640]   Apparently, this stuff's pretty robust at this point.
[00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:46.640]   Absolutely.
[00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:48.200]   MySQL is great.
[00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:49.200]   And he's...
[00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:50.200]   What is he?
[00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:51.200]   He's a fresh face.
[00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:52.200]   I have to watch that cranky face.
[00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:53.200]   I think he's 15.
[00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:55.640]   He looks like he's 15.
[00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:58.560]   He's so young, it's amazing.
[00:18:58.560 --> 00:18:59.560]   Let's talk a little bit about this.
[00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:02.840]   We've got Kevin here.
[00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:04.200]   He's within Vidya.
[00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:08.440]   The other guys merged with AMD.
[00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:11.560]   And now they're creating the first CPU/GPU combination.
[00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:15.600]   It's called Fusion.
[00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:17.000]   What do you think about all of this?
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:22.640]   And also, weren't there rumors that you guys were going to get purchased by Intel?
[00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:23.640]   Kevin?
[00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:24.640]   Hello?
[00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:25.640]   He's taking the David Prager way out.
[00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:26.640]   Oh, I'm back again.
[00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:27.640]   Sorry.
[00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:29.640]   He's sat on his mute button again.
[00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:32.200]   No, Leo has some...
[00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:36.520]   This I've noticed this myself because people out there have to realize we're all at various
[00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:37.520]   houses.
[00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:40.560]   If you get away from the mic for one second for any reason...
[00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:41.800]   I'll call on you right then.
[00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:45.480]   Leo has some sixth sense about this.
[00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:47.680]   I think it's so he knows it'll make him look good.
[00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:49.360]   Yeah, because I'm paying attention.
[00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:50.360]   No, I'm sorry.
[00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:52.360]   I hit this button and it hits mute.
[00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:53.360]   No, no, I'm sorry.
[00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:59.200]   Fusion, yeah, actually it's kind of cool because actually what they're trying to do
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:04.400]   is more than just taking the graphics and putting on to the CPU, what they eventually
[00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:11.160]   hope they hope to do is really extend the CPU to use the graphics unit for accelerating
[00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:12.560]   math in general.
[00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:17.480]   It's like the next generation math co-processor.
[00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:21.760]   And so beyond initial phase, which will be, okay, you could do graphics on the same die
[00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:26.140]   with the CPU, then it's being like, well, you can extend the instruction set just like
[00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:30.480]   AMD extended the instruction set from 32 to 64 bits.
[00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:34.480]   They now want to extend the instruction set to add graphics commands that will directly
[00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:36.680]   tie in the GPU right to the CPU.
[00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:41.800]   So you'll get this kind of real synergy of the two working closely together.
[00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:42.920]   They said an interesting thing.
[00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:49.400]   They said that the idea of multi-core is just a kind of rehash of the megahertz race that
[00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:51.480]   we had in the past.
[00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:54.200]   And it's not really the way to scale processor performance.
[00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:57.280]   They want to do something called accelerated processing units.
[00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:58.280]   Yeah.
[00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:04.920]   And the point is that with Windows and Vista, you can scale pretty well up to two or four
[00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:05.920]   CPUs.
[00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:09.240]   But after that, your efficiency starts going down.
[00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:12.320]   It starts going to say eight cores or 16 cores.
[00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:17.920]   So it's just not an infinitely scalable solution to setting more cores.
[00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:22.520]   With these accelerated units, you add new instructions, you add new functions that do
[00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:28.720]   some things really, really fast, like math computing or I think other examples they've
[00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:34.560]   talked about is running security encryption, decryption with a co-processor.
[00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:40.280]   And you can get a lot of efficiency there for a relatively small piece of silicon better
[00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:42.080]   than using general purpose instructions.
[00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:44.080]   It's kind of like DSPs then?
[00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:46.480]   And a little bit.
[00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:48.680]   Intel is taking probably a different attack.
[00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:51.480]   They haven't exactly given all the details what they're doing.
[00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:55.040]   But they've shown that the AD core designed an IDF.
[00:21:55.040 --> 00:22:00.520]   They're going to throw a lot of cores at it, very small cores, and try to scale that way
[00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:04.200]   and mix these smaller cores with wrapped around with some software.
[00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:07.520]   Are the APUs, are there different ones for different tasks?
[00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:08.520]   Is that the idea?
[00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:10.840]   You have many cores, but they do different things?
[00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:11.840]   Yes.
[00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:15.080]   And in the case of AMB, that's what they're going to specialize cores.
[00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:20.000]   I think Intel is going for more of a generalized core, a little more like to say the cell processor,
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.040]   where you had all those synergistic processing elements and you put a bunch of them together
[00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:26.960]   with a general purpose CPU.
[00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:32.280]   And then you map out tasks to run into various little units.
[00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:35.400]   You're probably the most qualified to vote here, Kevin, but whose approach makes the
[00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:37.760]   most sense to you?
[00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:43.080]   You know, where we're two years away from, or three years away from, the AMD solution
[00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:46.200]   and they are probably about the same from Intel.
[00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:48.160]   They're going in different paths.
[00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:50.160]   It really boils down to software.
[00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:52.080]   Both solutions can actually work real well.
[00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:59.680]   I think AMD may have a slightly slight advantage in that they can use standard graphics APIs
[00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:01.320]   that are available today.
[00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:05.920]   Intel is going to have to build from the ground up, scratch.
[00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:07.920]   And it's really going to be software.
[00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:11.400]   And to some extent, it's going to be how Microsoft votes in this deal.
[00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:15.720]   Microsoft is going to have to provide the software support and the independent software
[00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:17.880]   vendors are going to provide support for these guys.
[00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:20.440]   Well, right now they work best out of the box with the AMD solution.
[00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:22.280]   As you said, it's most compatible, right?
[00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:23.280]   Yeah.
[00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:27.280]   And it gives you a good interim solution, which is just use standard graphics APIs until
[00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:30.640]   you start really recoding with these new instructions.
[00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:32.960]   Two things seem to me.
[00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:39.800]   First of all, it's an interesting idea because the graphics processing, which have now been
[00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:48.200]   evolving separately over on graphics cards, is truly phenomenal when you look at the raw
[00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:52.600]   processing power that graphics add on adapters have.
[00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:56.400]   It's a phenomenal amount of processing.
[00:23:56.400 --> 00:24:05.040]   And so it's certainly interesting to imagine making that hardware processing available
[00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:10.960]   to the general purpose CPU in the machine, except that on the flip side, I have to ask,
[00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:14.800]   OK, well, what is the need that this is addressing?
[00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:20.120]   I mean, sure, if people wanted to run the SETI screensaver all the time and process signals
[00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:22.560]   from space, this thing would be able to do it.
[00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:29.680]   I don't see any, except for example, the notion of encryption handling, which again, even
[00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:35.480]   that is still a relatively small amount of burden based on the way crypto is today, is
[00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:38.640]   like, what problem is this answering?
[00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:41.560]   It really seems like it's architecture for its own sake.
[00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:43.080]   Well, there's some problems.
[00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:47.000]   I mean, in high performance computer space, the supercomputers, they're already doing
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   the ZORI design out there that's going to take an optoron, I think IBM is doing an optoron
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:57.560]   and a cell processor, emerging on one board to work together for supercomputers.
[00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:00.880]   So there's actually a real good use there.
[00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:06.000]   But I mean, for you and me, you know, for a person of the year.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.400]   Well, actually, what would be useful for is transcoding.
[00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:14.960]   You know, right now, transcoding is especially at high definition, is fairly slow.
[00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:20.840]   And this could actually crunch through a transcoder with obviously some other hardware support
[00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:23.160]   a lot faster.
[00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:27.520]   But you know, it's going to take some next generation applications.
[00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:32.520]   We've been people who talk about physics processors to make games more realistic.
[00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:33.720]   That's my question.
[00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:36.760]   I mean, I don't work.
[00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:41.280]   We need something to challenge these processors if we need them.
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:42.280]   Fast crypto.
[00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:43.280]   Okay.
[00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:44.280]   I mean, it's fast enough now.
[00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:46.880]   But I mean, I mean, that's about it.
[00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:51.560]   Yeah, well, it's kind of a classic situation with hardware and software.
[00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:56.320]   Hardware has to get out there first and then build a base and then you can go to the software
[00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:58.800]   that's a point to and say, "Hey, look, there's all this hardware here.
[00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:00.280]   Come on, you've got to use it now."
[00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:04.880]   Do you think, I mean, I remember saying this to Craig Barrett at Intel when they were pushing
[00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:05.880]   two gigahertz.
[00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:08.360]   And I said, "Who needs two gigahertz?"
[00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:10.280]   And you know, I mean, I'll be honest with you.
[00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:14.120]   Yeah, we all have two and three gigahertz processors, sometimes two or, in my case, four
[00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:15.760]   or two gigahertz processors.
[00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:21.600]   But I don't really get that we needed it anymore now than we did then, do we?
[00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:22.600]   Well, Vistemite.
[00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:23.600]   Vistemite.
[00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:24.600]   What you're doing?
[00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:25.600]   You have Vistemite.
[00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:28.040]   Vistemite mostly needs RAM, I think, more than anything else.
[00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:29.040]   No, I disagree.
[00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:32.440]   It doesn't need a GPU though, because it does need that for, if you weren't aware of the
[00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:33.440]   arrow, yeah, exactly.
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:34.440]   The arrow glass.
[00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:35.440]   I disagree with that.
[00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:38.840]   I mean, I've got two machine side-by-side sitting on my desk and I have them both hooked
[00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:43.960]   up and I go back and forth because I can't be able to completely migrate one because
[00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:46.320]   it's a typical problem with Windows.
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:51.880]   But the older machine with the two gigahertz processor is sluggish.
[00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:52.880]   Okay.
[00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:55.120]   I mean, well, but that's also because it's so old.
[00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:57.400]   I bet if you reinstalled Windows on it, it would just--
[00:26:57.400 --> 00:26:58.920]   I mean, I understand that a little bit.
[00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:02.720]   The only thing driving this right now is the fact that Microsoft keeps making bloated
[00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:04.520]   operating systems worse and worse.
[00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:07.000]   That's the only thing we need is, I think, faster hard drives.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.360]   Yeah, that's the boot.
[00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:10.360]   That's the bottleneck.
[00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:11.360]   Yes, I was just going to say--
[00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:12.360]   I know, it's a high-level.
[00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:18.400]   Yeah, I mean, you-- it's surprising how quickly you run into other bottlenecks than just the
[00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:19.400]   processor.
[00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:24.320]   I mean, it turns out that our buses are not that wide and not that fast compared to this.
[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:29.880]   And the problem with transcoding is if you had infinite computing power, there's still
[00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:32.120]   a lot of time required to suck this--
[00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:33.120]   I know.
[00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:39.560]   --is large files from the drive through the bus into the chip and back out again.
[00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:43.960]   And we see that just copying these multi-gig, you know, DV format files around.
[00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:44.960]   I think that's what's sluggish.
[00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:47.400]   I don't think it's a 1 gigahertz processor.
[00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:50.480]   I think it's a 5,400 RPM hard drive.
[00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:51.480]   Yeah.
[00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:53.240]   And those things are improving over time.
[00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:55.760]   And I think the hybrid drive is going to help boot time at least.
[00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:56.760]   But--
[00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:59.200]   You know, I tried with this red-- I have a VISTUS notebook now.
[00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:04.040]   And I tried the-- not the hybrid-- the ready boost with this-- and I didn't know it's
[00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:05.120]   any difference at all.
[00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:06.120]   Nope.
[00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:07.120]   Nope.
[00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:08.120]   Doesn't do diddly-doo.
[00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:10.320]   I mean, you talk about snake oil.
[00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:11.840]   You have a hybrid hard drive you send?
[00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:12.840]   No, no, no, no.
[00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:13.840]   There's two things.
[00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:14.840]   There's the ready drive and the ready boost.
[00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:16.200]   The ready boost uses a thumb drive.
[00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:17.200]   Oh, yeah.
[00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:18.200]   Yeah.
[00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:19.200]   And then there's nothing.
[00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:20.200]   Well--
[00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:21.200]   Get it in our hybrid disk.
[00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:22.200]   I mean, I don't think--
[00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:23.200]   Oh, yeah.
[00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:24.200]   Well, let me get right on that.
[00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:25.200]   Does Amazon have them?
[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:26.200]   I don't--
[00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:27.200]   Nobody has--
[00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:28.200]   You buy your hard disk from Amazon.
[00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:29.200]   Nobody has them.
[00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:34.160]   I do agree with Kevin, though, from the standpoint that once this stuff is there and it's like
[00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:38.880]   ubiquitously available, then you can imagine-- I mean, like, maybe we'll get-- finally,
[00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:41.320]   we'll get, like, better speech recognition.
[00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:43.240]   We'll get, you know, better text to speech.
[00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:47.960]   We'll get, you know, those things in the analog world that are still, you know, eluding
[00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:52.840]   us and are really perpetual sort of like, oh, yeah, we're going to get that next year.
[00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:57.640]   I mean, those are the things that require massive number crunching in order to-- you
[00:28:57.640 --> 00:29:02.360]   know, in order to get their performance up to a point where people begin to find them
[00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:08.240]   acceptable and having this kind of insane processing power while our gooies don't need
[00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:13.040]   them and, you know, word processing and so forth doesn't, you know, this sort of analog
[00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:17.640]   interface of the world, that's where this stuff can begin to find an application.
[00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:18.640]   So--
[00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:19.640]   Big--
[00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:20.640]   Well, I'm sorry.
[00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:23.560]   I didn't-- and this kind of relates to what Kevin's talking about, but I just want to mention
[00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:28.480]   something, I just got an email from somebody who reviewed version of Vista and they ran
[00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:30.800]   and they were running glass or that whatever this--
[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:31.800]   Yeah.
[00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:36.560]   --he said that and it's in the law office and he says that everybody's at the office was
[00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:37.560]   getting nauseous.
[00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:40.320]   It does a weird thing in a window.
[00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:43.560]   John, it makes you feel like your eyes are out of focus.
[00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:44.560]   Yeah.
[00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:45.560]   I mean, I totally understand that.
[00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:47.120]   And it does a weird thing when you open and close a window.
[00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:49.000]   It kind of-- I'm not sure if I like it.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   It does this little--
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   So it sort of shrinks and falls away.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   It's like this weird.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   It is vertigo.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.520]   Now, you could turn it off, obviously.
[00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:56.720]   But I have to-- I wonder.
[00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:58.240]   I mean, it's kind of a weird effect.
[00:29:58.240 --> 00:29:59.240]   I don't know if it's--
[00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:00.960]   It doesn't feel right.
[00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:02.160]   Are they stoners up there?
[00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:04.720]   I mean, what would be the purpose of designing something?
[00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:11.520]   Don't they-- I know for a fact that Microsoft has a tonnage building full of testers where
[00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:12.520]   they look at the stuff.
[00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:13.520]   There's too many.
[00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:14.520]   That's the problem.
[00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:15.520]   There's too many.
[00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:16.520]   And no one's noticed this?
[00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:17.520]   No.
[00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:19.280]   I mean, you have not seen it yet, John?
[00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:20.280]   No.
[00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:21.280]   I've been avoiding it.
[00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:27.200]   All it does is it blurs what's underneath the borders of the window.
[00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:29.560]   And I find it really annoying because I mean--
[00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:32.320]   Well, I'm not-- that's the Aero Glass translucency.
[00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:34.520]   And that's weird to begin with.
[00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:35.520]   But then--
[00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:36.520]   It's like frosted.
[00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:37.520]   It's frosted.
[00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:40.160]   But then there's little stuff in there that's not really in there and it's weird.
[00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:43.400]   But then what-- can you figure out, Steve, because it's happening too fast for me to
[00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:47.280]   figure out, what is-- what are the windows doing when they're maximizing and minimizing?
[00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:48.280]   They're doing--
[00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:49.280]   They're--
[00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:52.320]   They do have sort of a 3D-ish transform.
[00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:55.720]   They're fading out at the same time.
[00:30:55.720 --> 00:31:00.120]   They're causing the window to look like it's sort of falling back away from you so that
[00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:03.600]   the top of the window shrinks faster than the bottom.
[00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:04.600]   So it's sort of--
[00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:08.280]   But it's not like the Mac Genie effect, which is slow.
[00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:09.280]   No, no.
[00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:10.780]   And then you could figure out what it's doing.
[00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:11.780]   It's weird.
[00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:12.780]   Yeah.
[00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:15.800]   I mean, it's a strange look.
[00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:19.200]   And in terms of burning up cycles, if you want to save some, the good news is--
[00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:20.720]   You can turn it off.
[00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:24.200]   And I immediately turn it off just because it's just-- I find it annoying.
[00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:27.920]   Well, I'm trying to use Vista, you know, kind of vanilla without doing too much to change
[00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:31.520]   it just because I want to, you know, see what people are going to be saying.
[00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:32.520]   One problem--
[00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:34.520]   I'll tell you the biggest problem I have with Vista right now, I think we talked about it
[00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:38.960]   on security now, is still with all of the great default security stuff they're turning
[00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:39.960]   on.
[00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:40.960]   And there's a lot of it.
[00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:44.680]   They're still, by default, creating you as an administrative user.
[00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:48.080]   They don't suggest-- at least, not on my installs.
[00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:51.160]   They don't suggest that you create a second account that's a limited user.
[00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:52.160]   They don't do any of that.
[00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:54.320]   They just make you a route right from the beginning.
[00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:57.800]   You know why, Leo, the reason is it would upset too many people.
[00:31:57.800 --> 00:32:03.120]   I mean, Microsoft is all about not breaking things that were the way they were.
[00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:06.520]   The irony is it runs pretty well if you create-- I mean, the first thing it is create a limited
[00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:07.680]   user and I run as that.
[00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:12.200]   And because of all this user access control, it does a pretty good job of handling it.
[00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:16.200]   I ask it ask for my password frequently, but everything runs fine.
[00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:17.200]   Yep.
[00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:20.000]   The software foundation has created a site called BadVista.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.840]   God, I know.
[00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:27.720]   Is it a default in Vista to prompt you for, like, say, in OS 10, if you're going to install
[00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:30.240]   anything, it asks you to put in an admin password.
[00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:33.160]   Well, it doesn't ask you for the password most of the time.
[00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:37.520]   Well, actually, it does, if you're not logged in as admin, then you have to provide admin
[00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:38.520]   credentials.
[00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:39.520]   And that's why you should be using that limited user.
[00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:41.640]   They ought to do it the same way as OS 10.
[00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:43.800]   They ask you, but it's too easy to click OK.
[00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:46.200]   I think, yeah, I think you should be asked for a password.
[00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:49.800]   And sometimes it does, even if you're administrator, it's sometimes asked you.
[00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:53.080]   Well, it's called user access control UAC.
[00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:54.920]   And it's a big deal in Vista.
[00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:59.960]   I mean, it's one of the-- they're major things that they're touting as the way that you'll
[00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:03.080]   catch malware trying to do something bad to you.
[00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:06.800]   The good news is, if you really don't like it, you can turn it off.
[00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:10.320]   But you know, like Leo, I'm finding myself getting used to it.
[00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:11.320]   I like it.
[00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:15.160]   Then the danger is you get too used to it and you just say, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, without
[00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:16.720]   giving it a second thought.
[00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:24.640]   So according to Slashtot, I guess, an underground hacker, this is from E-Week, are hawking at
[00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:28.520]   auction, a zero-day exploit for Windows Vista.
[00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:31.520]   And that was according to the Trend Micro, actually.
[00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:32.520]   It was a Trend Micro.
[00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:33.520]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:34.520]   Trend Micro found it.
[00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:36.280]   The story is from E-Week.
[00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:39.240]   They want $50,000 for it.
[00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:42.160]   Which is really stupid because they ought to be-- if they have these, they ought to be
[00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:46.960]   waiting until February or March when there's actually an install base and selling these
[00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:47.960]   things now.
[00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:48.960]   No, maybe not.
[00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:49.960]   Maybe they'll do adapt to it.
[00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:50.960]   They want the money.
[00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:51.960]   What are you talking about, stupid?
[00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:52.960]   This is smart.
[00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:58.760]   This is apparently Trend Micro snuck somebody into-- I'm sorry, my phone keeps ringing.
[00:33:58.760 --> 00:33:59.760]   Hold on a second.
[00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:03.560]   You actually just ought to be apologizing about the ringtone you've chosen, Leo.
[00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:05.360]   What did I couldn't hear it?
[00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:10.080]   God, it was, you know, these people who have these long songs that they have their phones
[00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:11.080]   play.
[00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:12.960]   Oh my God.
[00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:14.720]   What happened to, you know, ring, ring?
[00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:15.880]   Mine just kind of beeps.
[00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:16.880]   I tried to--
[00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:17.880]   I mean, it's embarrassing.
[00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:21.080]   Wouldn't you be embarrassed if your phone started going off and playing the Star Spangled
[00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:22.080]   Banner or something?
[00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:23.080]   Yeah, or some rap song.
[00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:24.080]   Exactly.
[00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:27.960]   Of course, the one that's always amusing, my son has one, so it rings like an old, you
[00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:29.680]   know, hand-crank phone.
[00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:30.680]   Uh-huh.
[00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:31.680]   You know, that's--
[00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:32.680]   Now that's class, but--
[00:34:32.680 --> 00:34:33.680]   Well, I don't know about that.
[00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:34.680]   That's just as annoying to me.
[00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:38.640]   I mean, you know, the best ones are kind of a subtle beep that's not too, like, you
[00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:39.640]   know, what we're used to.
[00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:40.640]   All I'm like, my thing is--
[00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:43.920]   I was just knowing that it's going to-- if I know that it's ringing, then it's done
[00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:46.120]   its job, and I'd rather not be obtrusive about it.
[00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:47.120]   Well, you want to--
[00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:48.120]   I want the Star Trek one.
[00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:50.280]   I just saw the TV show on Friday.
[00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:51.440]   I'm going to play my ring for you.
[00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:52.440]   I like it.
[00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:53.920]   Dude, I think I have a good ring.
[00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:54.920]   Uh-oh.
[00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:55.920]   Oh, play it.
[00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:56.920]   You want to hear my ring?
[00:34:56.920 --> 00:34:57.920]   I mean, I got to push both--
[00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:01.560]   I guess the only argument in favor of that is when you've got a whole bunch of people sitting
[00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:06.840]   around a table, no one knows whose phone is ringing if they all sound sort of generic,
[00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:07.840]   you know, Nokia ring.
[00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:08.840]   Oh, man.
[00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:10.840]   Oh, that's a big, big, big, big.
[00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:13.360]   He's plugging his own show.
[00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:14.360]   I like my ring.
[00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:15.360]   Turn it off.
[00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:17.440]   You know what's really bad?
[00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:21.760]   You call my 800 number, and I force you to listen to this for like a while.
[00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:25.000]   Anyway, back to the-- okay, I'm going to make an edit there.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   Back to the--
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   Sure.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   Maybe I'll leave that in, actually.
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:30.680]   Yeah, I'll leave it in.
[00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:31.880]   Back to the Windows Vista expert.
[00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:36.960]   Actually, it's kind of-- it's kind of interesting because Trend Micro snuck a mole into this
[00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:44.640]   underground auction for malware, and they found that unpatched code execution flaws
[00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:50.680]   are selling for the $20,000 to $30,000, depending on the popularity of the software and the reliability
[00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:51.680]   of the attack code.
[00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:52.680]   Well, the reliability--
[00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:54.600]   Well, the reliability of the zero install base.
[00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:56.120]   Well, no, this isn't just for Vista.
[00:35:56.120 --> 00:35:59.480]   This is like an auction in general.
[00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:04.960]   Bots and Trojan downloaders are typically hijack Windows machines for use in spam spewing botanets
[00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:07.920]   or selling for about $5,000.
[00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:09.840]   That seems high to me.
[00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:15.040]   Well no, not if you could sell these machines back to spammers for $0.10 each.
[00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:16.040]   Maybe not.
[00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:17.040]   I don't know.
[00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:18.040]   Maybe this may all be bogus.
[00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:22.920]   I mean, I heard years ago when I first got kind of involved with following this, and the
[00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:26.160]   result being when not getting any spam is the--
[00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:27.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:29.360]   Divorked out all stuff, blah, blah, blah.
[00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:30.360]   I have no--
[00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:31.360]   Anyway, anyway.
[00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:32.800]   --fouled away, never to get spam.
[00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:38.800]   Anyway, is that you could rent these botanets from these underground groups, but you'd get--
[00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:44.360]   you could rent like 10 or 20,000 machines, and it was-- I thought it was like $1,000
[00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:45.520]   a week or something like that.
[00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:49.480]   I mean, that's why it makes me think these are high prices for-- it means like a mailing
[00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:50.480]   list business.
[00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:54.360]   I mean, the names are worth a little more when you don't rent them, but they usually
[00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:56.080]   worth about 10 times one rental.
[00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:57.440]   Well, now this one makes sense.
[00:36:57.440 --> 00:37:02.120]   A custom Trojan capable of stealing online account information can be bought for between
[00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:03.920]   $1,000 and $5,000.
[00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:08.320]   A botnet building piece of malware, $5,000 to $20,000.
[00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:11.240]   Credit card numbers with valid pins, $500 each.
[00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:15.960]   Man, I mean, this-- do you think this is real or this is just a trend micro-tranist or
[00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:16.960]   up some--
[00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:17.960]   Or it could be a honeypot.
[00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:18.960]   Could be a honeypot.
[00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:21.160]   Could be they stumbled into something else.
[00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:25.520]   Social security numbers, home addresses, and birthday, $80 to $300.
[00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:29.000]   Drivers license is $150, birth certificates, $150.
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   Social security card is $100.
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:32.880]   Did a driver's license for $150?
[00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:33.880]   Yeah.
[00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:34.880]   Wow.
[00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:35.880]   I wish they'd say where this is.
[00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:36.880]   I think we should--
[00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:37.880]   Sounds like a good deal.
[00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:38.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:44.080]   Well, especially when it's $50,000 for a VISTA exploit, maybe you buy the driver's license
[00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:47.440]   so you can get out of the country after you do it.
[00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:48.800]   I need to need that passport.
[00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:52.680]   So here's the really interesting-- I think the interesting story of the week.
[00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:54.600]   And it's perfect timing for us.
[00:37:54.600 --> 00:38:03.840]   This Moto goes way out on a limb announcing on Friday that the iPhones coming out on Monday.
[00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:05.320]   Is that like tomorrow Monday?
[00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:06.320]   Yeah.
[00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:07.320]   Wow.
[00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:08.320]   Let me read you.
[00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:09.320]   It's a very short-- won't take long.
[00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:11.320]   I can read you the posting.
[00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:15.640]   Gizmodo knows-- this is by Gizmodo writer Brian Lamb.
[00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:19.320]   Gizmodo knows iPhone will be announced on Monday.
[00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:21.120]   I guarantee it.
[00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:22.800]   It isn't what I expected at all.
[00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:24.360]   And I've already said too much.
[00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:26.240]   That's it, period, end of sentence.
[00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:27.240]   Oh, cryptic.
[00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:28.400]   Well, that doesn't make any sense.
[00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:30.560]   There's no announcement for a press conference.
[00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:34.640]   Why would Gizmodo-- but the risk to Gizmodo of going out in the line-- I mean, maybe it's
[00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:40.200]   like the Samsung iPhone, but the risk to Gizmodo of going out on the limb like this seems
[00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:41.200]   very high.
[00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:45.400]   You usually Apple would send out invites to a special event.
[00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:46.400]   Yeah, that's--
[00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:47.400]   Well, minimally.
[00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:48.400]   And we wouldn't have been--
[00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:49.400]   Because we didn't get one more thing.
[00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:51.240]   Is it just not credible?
[00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:55.160]   Well, I mean, those guys are pretty good, but that doesn't sound right.
[00:38:55.160 --> 00:38:57.000]   I mean, there's too many missing elements.
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.440]   Where's the-- where's the-- with the embargoed press releases?
[00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:00.440]   Where's the-- I mean, you--
[00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:02.800]   Well, because they don't want people to get fired, I guess.
[00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:04.280]   No, there would have been a buzz.
[00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:08.280]   I mean, Apple at least gives you a heads up that something's going to happen.
[00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:09.280]   They don't tell you what.
[00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:10.280]   Yeah.
[00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:11.280]   Well, also, here we are.
[00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:12.760]   This is like less than a week before Christmas.
[00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:16.240]   Brian, and that would be a horrible thing to do unless they were already in the pipeline.
[00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:18.040]   If they were in the pipeline, we'd have photos.
[00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:19.040]   We'd know about.
[00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:21.040]   Because somebody would bust a photo out of the best store.
[00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:26.400]   You're trying to kill sales of other competing products, and the announcement is we'll give
[00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:27.400]   it to you in January.
[00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:31.040]   But you would also kill your iPod sales during these last couple of weeks.
[00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:32.040]   Yeah, no, this is--
[00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:33.040]   Well, except for the rumors.
[00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:34.040]   Except for the rumors.
[00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:37.040]   I do know that I want to get a new phone, and I'm kind of waiting just to see what this
[00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:38.040]   is.
[00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:39.040]   We're waiting, aren't we?
[00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:40.040]   I want to see what this is going to be to see if I want it or not, and then I'll get
[00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:42.000]   the phone that I'm going to end up getting.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:43.040]   And according to Kevin--
[00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:44.040]   Yep.
[00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:49.440]   --who-- and Kevin Rose said this on Ignatian, the models are 4 gig and 8 gig, and I think
[00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:51.280]   there's other confirming people saying that.
[00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:55.840]   So it's not going to cannibalize your main business, which is the iPod with video.
[00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:58.200]   It hurts your nano business, though.
[00:39:58.200 --> 00:40:01.280]   Well, we'll see tomorrow, won't we?
[00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:04.120]   I think it's fascinating that it gives me-- yeah, it gives me photos credible, right?
[00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:06.800]   I mean, these guys are one of the two big gadget blogs.
[00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:09.840]   Yeah, but you know, you can get suckered into thinking the wrong thing.
[00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:10.840]   I mean, it happened to me recently.
[00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:13.000]   I just can't see how a week before Christmas.
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   It makes any sense.
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:15.000]   What happened to you?
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   Listen.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   John, when did you--
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:18.840]   I said that Google in no way would buy YouTube.
[00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:19.840]   Oh, yeah, that one.
[00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:24.080]   I think-- did you also say there'd be a shake-up at Yahoo?
[00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:26.440]   I did say there was going to be a shake-up at Yahoo, and there was.
[00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:31.880]   But the thing is, the shake-up at Yahoo is a-- I think it's-- well, I think it's going
[00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:35.160]   to be a short-term winner and a long-term disaster.
[00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:36.160]   But--
[00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:37.160]   But Seamus-- not out, is he?
[00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:41.120]   No, Seamus-- not out, but he's put this woman, Decker, in charge of the company-- or
[00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:43.720]   essentially, she's on the fast track to take his job.
[00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:46.080]   And they moved Rosen-Swagout, who's actually a sales guy.
[00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:47.880]   And they put this woman who's a bean counter in front--
[00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:48.880]   Oh, yeah, it's--
[00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:50.200]   See, we thought Dan would be running the show.
[00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:55.320]   Well, but here's what a friend of mine-- because I wrote a column in MarketWatch, you know,
[00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:58.160]   moaning about this as being idiotic.
[00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:03.600]   And a friend of mine who happens to know this woman's husband or something in their pals,
[00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:07.520]   they told me that this woman's an M&A expert in this.
[00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:09.080]   Obviously, they're putting her on the track.
[00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:14.640]   They're going to-- there's going to be some sort of a-- Yahoo buy-out buy-in merger acquisition
[00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:15.640]   of some sort.
[00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:18.200]   So she's going to oversee the transition to whatever--
[00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:22.320]   It must be a whopper if they would put a bean counter in it as a top person in a company
[00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:23.320]   as advertising or--
[00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:24.560]   Well, maybe they feel desperate.
[00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:26.560]   Maybe they're panicking.
[00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:28.840]   I mean, it's not good at Yahoo right now.
[00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:29.840]   Why isn't it?
[00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:32.400]   Because their peanut butter's spread too thin.
[00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:33.400]   Who cares?
[00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:36.880]   I'm not a big subscriber to this theory.
[00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:39.160]   You know, they got the most page views of anybody.
[00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:40.160]   I mean--
[00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:42.960]   I think they're-- I've always thought they were very strong company.
[00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:47.960]   But they've taken missteps. You even said that by overextending into China and so forth.
[00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:52.080]   Well, no, they throw a lot of money at places like they did the China deal and they-- you
[00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:55.600]   know, when they bought broadcast.com for its re-bealing or whatever.
[00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:59.480]   But they manage to throw all this money away and they still are making money.
[00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:03.920]   I mean, to me, it's like they must be-- you know, if they could stop being wasteful, it
[00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:04.920]   would be unbelievable.
[00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:10.240]   So how do these things happen where a gizmodo gets fooled or you get fooled by a--
[00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:12.720]   Well, I got fooled. I got fooled myself.
[00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:13.720]   I didn't get fooled.
[00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:15.960]   You talked yourself out of it. It wasn't like you had an inside source.
[00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:16.960]   Right. No, I didn't have a--
[00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:21.480]   You said it doesn't make sense. And frankly, I agree with you and I agreed with you then.
[00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:24.200]   How does gizmodo get fooled?
[00:42:24.200 --> 00:42:27.360]   I think they got suckered. Somebody must have suckered. Somebody told them.
[00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:28.360]   You know, what would--
[00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:32.760]   He had a conversation with someone at Apple and he got all excited at him saying something
[00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:34.960]   and then it's probably not even true.
[00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:37.000]   Well, that could really hurt though. That could really hurt.
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.200]   Well, they got the-- they could have got the date wrong.
[00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:42.960]   And Apple's known pretty well for chasing out-- I mean, for trying to prosecute their
[00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:43.960]   own people--
[00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:46.840]   Well, he says so little. I don't see how they could-- I mean, there's nothing here.
[00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:49.800]   It's just-- it's going to come out. That's it.
[00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:51.760]   And there's no other buzz besides just this one?
[00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:52.760]   Nothing else.
[00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:56.680]   It just makes no sense a week before Christmas. There's just no way this makes any sense.
[00:42:56.680 --> 00:42:58.240]   So were we voting? It's not going to happen?
[00:42:58.240 --> 00:42:59.240]   Not going to happen.
[00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:00.240]   Yeah.
[00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:02.440]   I want another one of those Google YouTube merger things.
[00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:07.120]   I mean, I'm going to vote-- well, again, though, we're doing a logic and I think Steve's
[00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:09.120]   got it right. A week before Christmas, you don't want to know.
[00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:10.120]   Something like this.
[00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:14.160]   Oh, you mean, everybody who knows anything about retailing knows that all this stuff
[00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:16.040]   is done in the summertime for Christmas.
[00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:18.120]   David? Yes or no? Is it going to happen?
[00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:20.800]   I think it's going to happen in Macworld next on Jaden Jaden.
[00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:21.800]   Right.
[00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:22.800]   Right.
[00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:26.200]   Kevin, you want to go out on a limb?
[00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:27.200]   You know?
[00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:28.200]   I want to ask him in my business.
[00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:31.760]   No, no, that's the-- is the other Kevin, I think, probably knows more about it than
[00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:32.760]   I would.
[00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:33.760]   But it's--
[00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:34.760]   He's not saying anything now.
[00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:36.160]   He's shut the heck up.
[00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:40.520]   I bet against initially that Apple was going to go with Intel and thought that was wrong
[00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:42.520]   until I got an information to--
[00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:43.520]   Me too.
[00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:44.520]   I was correlate.
[00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:46.720]   That was actually-- what is going to happen?
[00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:47.720]   Right.
[00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:48.720]   Kevin--
[00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:49.720]   Go ahead.
[00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:50.720]   I'm sorry.
[00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:51.720]   Finish, Kevin.
[00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:53.720]   I was going to say that maybe the announcement is a non-announcement.
[00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:57.080]   Maybe they're just going to announce that they're not doing the phone or the phone or
[00:43:57.080 --> 00:43:59.280]   they're-- everybody said they're going to do a phone.
[00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:01.440]   Maybe they're just going to announce, OK, we are going to do a phone and it's going
[00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:02.440]   to be--
[00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:04.280]   It's a high-chap phone.
[00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:06.720]   It's not a real phone, it's a high-chap.
[00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:08.040]   I'm going to go out on a limb, I'm going to say.
[00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:09.320]   They're coming out with it tomorrow.
[00:44:09.320 --> 00:44:12.400]   I'm going to be in the store, first in line, ready to buy.
[00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:13.400]   It's coming out--
[00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:16.680]   It's coming out on Monday, Monday, January the 8th.
[00:44:16.680 --> 00:44:18.520]   I'm at the Apple Store.
[00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:23.120]   I'm going to be at the Apple Store December 18th, first in line 9am.
[00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:25.320]   I'm buying one and I'm going to laugh at you guys.
[00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:27.080]   I'm going to laugh.
[00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:28.080]   I'm taking it to Mexico.
[00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:30.400]   I'm leaving for Mexico on Wednesday and I want an Apple iPhone.
[00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:34.240]   No, this is-- it's a ploy to tell everyone don't buy phones because we're coming out
[00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:37.200]   with ours on Monday and it's going to be Monday the 8th.
[00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:38.200]   It's January 8th.
[00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:41.600]   That's when the ITV will be announced, that's when the new iPod will be announced.
[00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:44.680]   What do you think Apple's going to partner with the cell this fall?
[00:44:44.680 --> 00:44:46.280]   Well, what Kevin says is no one.
[00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:47.760]   Now, this makes sense.
[00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:49.600]   Actually, he says something that doesn't make sense.
[00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:53.600]   He says they're going to do a CDMA and a GSM version that you can't-- if you're a
[00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:58.840]   Verizon customer, you can't buy a CDMA phone even if it's unlocked and get it on the network.
[00:44:58.840 --> 00:45:01.320]   So you have to go to a dealer and get it on the network.
[00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:02.480]   So I don't think that makes any sense.
[00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:07.800]   I think it's going to be a GSM unlocked phone, T-Mobile, singular, Europeans, everywhere across
[00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:08.800]   the world.
[00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:11.160]   They can just put a chip in, sim chip in, and it's your phone.
[00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:12.160]   That makes sense.
[00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:13.160]   Then they don't have to partner with anybody.
[00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:15.240]   It's a consumer electronics device.
[00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:20.520]   But it would be very innovative if they could do both a CDMA and a GSM.
[00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:22.080]   How would that work though business-wise?
[00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:23.080]   I don't understand.
[00:45:23.080 --> 00:45:25.000]   It'd be expensive because you put both chips in.
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:26.520]   You got to have two radios.
[00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:27.520]   Two chips in.
[00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:28.520]   And how do you get it activated?
[00:45:28.520 --> 00:45:29.520]   What's the point?
[00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:30.520]   GSM is everywhere.
[00:45:30.520 --> 00:45:31.760]   Yeah, I would just do GSM.
[00:45:31.760 --> 00:45:32.760]   I think Kevin missed the boat.
[00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:35.880]   I mean, you do have to have the two different bands for the European and American.
[00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:38.080]   Yeah, they do quad band or whatever.
[00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:43.320]   Yeah, but the other thing is you have vendors like Verizon at which aren't GSM that they're
[00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:47.120]   still one of the better vendors in terms of coverage.
[00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:52.040]   Well, and if it's a digital device, the CDMA network is capable of transferring much
[00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:55.200]   more data to and from a phone than GSM.
[00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:57.600]   Yeah, it's so much better than Edge.
[00:45:57.600 --> 00:45:59.120]   You know, Edge, exactly.
[00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:00.120]   Exactly.
[00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:01.120]   Edge just doesn't do it.
[00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:04.160]   Kevin's information I think was seemed very credible.
[00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:06.280]   The notion that this thing will have two batteries.
[00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:07.280]   That makes sense.
[00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:12.400]   So that the audio player, which will either be four or eight gigs, won't drain the cell
[00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:13.400]   phone player.
[00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:14.400]   I mean, that makes sense.
[00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:18.040]   The idea that it's going to have a touchscreen and some sort of a little slide out keyboard.
[00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:20.880]   I mean, I can't wait for this thing.
[00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:23.120]   It's going to sound with two sets of batteries.
[00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:24.120]   Give me a break.
[00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:25.120]   Really sounds like fun.
[00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:26.120]   How about batteries are little now?
[00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:28.160]   Well, but look at the battery in the new shuffle.
[00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:30.160]   That thing is micro-tiny.
[00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:33.120]   And it plays music for 12 hours.
[00:46:33.120 --> 00:46:34.120]   It's flash, remember.
[00:46:34.120 --> 00:46:35.400]   We're not moving any parts here.
[00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:36.400]   Yep.
[00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:37.400]   You're going to like this, John.
[00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:41.480]   Firefly is going to be a massively multiplayer online role-playing game.
[00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:42.480]   No.
[00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:45.320]   And not just John Gibson's a major fan of Firefly.
[00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:46.320]   That's right.
[00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:47.320]   You are too.
[00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:48.320]   I am too.
[00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:49.320]   Love it.
[00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:50.320]   I might.
[00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:51.320]   This was when I might play.
[00:46:51.320 --> 00:46:53.720]   World of Warcraft's world is not, to me, a compelling world.
[00:46:53.720 --> 00:47:00.120]   But boy, if you could be in the world of the brown coats, dude, I just love to see
[00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:04.000]   that the franchise is continuing all, even though the movie was in disaster.
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:05.400]   It just shows you it, doesn't it?
[00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:06.400]   The movie was good, though.
[00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:07.400]   It wasn't a bad movie.
[00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:08.400]   Yeah.
[00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:09.400]   Great, but it lost money.
[00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:10.400]   Didn't really.
[00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:11.400]   Yeah.
[00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:12.400]   It promoted very well.
[00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:14.960]   It's about twice what they brought in.
[00:47:14.960 --> 00:47:20.840]   You know, compared to the Star Trek and Star Wars franchise, it's a word.
[00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:21.840]   Yeah, I'm looking for it.
[00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:24.320]   You know, this is still a very small franchise.
[00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:26.240]   Too bad because it's better.
[00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:27.600]   It's like a hundred times better.
[00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:29.600]   It's a really good and funny.
[00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:30.600]   Yeah, it was just great.
[00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:31.600]   Hey, if they...
[00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:33.680]   The Battlestar Galactica is building up.
[00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:34.960]   It's doing very well.
[00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:36.560]   I don't think it's as good as Firefly.
[00:47:36.560 --> 00:47:38.360]   I think Firefly is better to me, to be honest.
[00:47:38.360 --> 00:47:40.080]   I like Battlestar Galactica, but I...
[00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:41.760]   Oh, I don't like Battlestar Galactica at all.
[00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:42.760]   Not as much.
[00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:44.560]   It's kind of a little dark.
[00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:45.560]   It's been tough to...
[00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:49.640]   You got that hot babe who keeps, you know, shot out.
[00:47:49.640 --> 00:47:50.640]   She's no Inara.
[00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:53.160]   Oh, you mean the big tall blonde?
[00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:54.160]   I don't know.
[00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:55.160]   It shows up.
[00:47:55.160 --> 00:47:56.160]   I don't like her.
[00:47:56.160 --> 00:47:57.160]   She's got to...
[00:47:57.160 --> 00:47:59.560]   She's Cylon number five or something.
[00:47:59.560 --> 00:48:01.560]   Miss Redspine, 1966.
[00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:03.760]   This seems to be the new thing.
[00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:07.160]   You always have to have a babe on every Star Trek...
[00:48:07.160 --> 00:48:08.640]   A Star Wars or Star Trek?
[00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:10.680]   Oh, we've got to have Icondi for the nerds.
[00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:11.680]   I like...
[00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:12.680]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:14.680]   That's even sad, but it always ends up that way.
[00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:15.680]   Sex sells.
[00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:17.320]   I like ours Technica.
[00:48:17.320 --> 00:48:19.480]   They rewrote the Firefly theme.
[00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:22.280]   ♪ Take my show, take my film ♪
[00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:24.560]   ♪ Take me where I cannot sim ♪
[00:48:24.560 --> 00:48:26.720]   ♪ I don't care, I'm still free ♪
[00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:29.720]   ♪ You can't take my MMORPG ♪
[00:48:29.720 --> 00:48:30.720]   Yeah, okay.
[00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:32.520]   You want to sing that again, Lee?
[00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:33.520]   No.
[00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:34.520]   You hated that theme.
[00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:36.120]   Oh, you mean the theme for the TV show?
[00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:38.040]   That's supposed to be the theme for the TV show.
[00:48:38.040 --> 00:48:40.800]   I think this theme for the TV show killed the show.
[00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:41.800]   And I had Fox.
[00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:43.200]   I liked it, it grew on me.
[00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:45.360]   I knew you hated it, but I liked it.
[00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:46.360]   It was terrible.
[00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:49.680]   And the other one that was worse was the one from Star Trek Enterprise.
[00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:51.400]   Oh, yeah, that was horrible.
[00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:52.400]   That was worse.
[00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:53.800]   What was the point of that music?
[00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:57.720]   And then of course they had to, you know, kill the end of the show with the whole thing
[00:48:57.720 --> 00:48:59.280]   being a dream.
[00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:01.120]   No, they didn't do that, did they?
[00:49:01.120 --> 00:49:02.120]   Yeah, don't you remember?
[00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:06.960]   Yeah, they were all done on the holodeck and they had a couple of guys watching it.
[00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:08.520]   It's unbelievably stupid.
[00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:09.960]   That's worse than Dallas, man.
[00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:13.440]   Well, there was a lot of agreement with John for the first couple of years.
[00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:14.840]   That theme was awful.
[00:49:14.840 --> 00:49:17.280]   They had it redone in I think the third year.
[00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:20.200]   And so then we stopped watching it.
[00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:24.280]   So Nintendo is recalling its wee straps, actually not really, but they're offering to
[00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:25.280]   replace their wee straps.
[00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:26.440]   Isn't that the funniest thing?
[00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:27.440]   I just love that.
[00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:29.480]   I think this is a publicity stunt.
[00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:33.000]   No, you know, there's two sites about wee destruction.
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:35.080]   I think those are all fake.
[00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:38.800]   First of all, this has got publicity stunt written all over it.
[00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:40.000]   I looked at that strap.
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:41.720]   I think that's been held the strap.
[00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:46.320]   It is thin, but I'll bet the problem is that people are not wearing the strap.
[00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:49.680]   They're not slipping their hand through the strap.
[00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:52.480]   And so they're guaranteed you're going to put in the controllers.
[00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:56.760]   Putting that strap on is the same as deciding you need to wear a helmet while riding a
[00:49:56.760 --> 00:49:57.760]   segue.
[00:49:57.760 --> 00:49:58.760]   I mean, that's stupid.
[00:49:58.760 --> 00:50:08.120]   So there's wehaveaproblem.com with videos of people throwing their wee motes through
[00:50:08.120 --> 00:50:12.920]   the TV or damaged kids and into each other.
[00:50:12.920 --> 00:50:13.920]   Into each other.
[00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:16.640]   But I think if you have the strap on, it's not going to break.
[00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:19.640]   I really think they're eating fried chicken.
[00:50:19.640 --> 00:50:22.200]   Well, and they're playing Zelda, and that's it.
[00:50:22.200 --> 00:50:27.760]   If the strap broke, the act of breaking the strap would decelerate the controller.
[00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:29.120]   So it just drops in front of you.
[00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:31.240]   I mean, I'm on Dvorak's side big time now.
[00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:33.600]   This is hardcore publicity stunt.
[00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:35.280]   Why though, is it good for Nintendo?
[00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:36.280]   Yeah, I don't see that.
[00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:37.280]   In what way is this good?
[00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:42.480]   Draw the attention to the fact that people are getting so into this thing, it's so unbelievably
[00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:46.480]   addictive and compelling that they're swinging these things around and killing each other.
[00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:48.080]   But there's also people who say it's dangerous.
[00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:51.280]   Yeah, I mean, a lot of parents will say, "Oh, we're not buying that way because that
[00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:52.280]   remote got it."
[00:50:52.280 --> 00:50:53.280]   Oh, I don't know about that.
[00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:54.520]   Well, like we have a problem.
[00:50:54.520 --> 00:50:56.720]   Look at go to we damage.
[00:50:56.720 --> 00:50:57.720]   W-I-I damage.
[00:50:57.720 --> 00:50:58.720]   Well, go to we have a problem.
[00:50:58.720 --> 00:51:02.400]   It says this website's a parody and not affiliated with Nintendo.
[00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:03.400]   You know, I mean, okay.
[00:51:03.400 --> 00:51:04.400]   Well, they don't want to get sued.
[00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:05.400]   That's all.
[00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:06.400]   But look at...
[00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:08.400]   There's something fishy about this.
[00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:09.880]   Yeah, maybe you're right.
[00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:12.280]   It's just fishy because there's just too much of this.
[00:51:12.280 --> 00:51:14.640]   And I first started seeing these stories.
[00:51:14.640 --> 00:51:18.560]   I'm thinking, how is this like all of a sudden a big issue where they're getting so much
[00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:19.560]   publicity for the Wii?
[00:51:19.560 --> 00:51:20.560]   Well, they issue to recall.
[00:51:20.560 --> 00:51:21.560]   Because of these controllers.
[00:51:21.560 --> 00:51:23.280]   No, it's a voluntary one.
[00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:24.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:51:24.280 --> 00:51:26.360]   You go on and you bring us your strap, we'll give you a new one.
[00:51:26.360 --> 00:51:27.360]   And then there's some...
[00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:31.000]   This move is expected to cost Nintendo several million, but then I don't know why they're
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:32.000]   saying that.
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:35.200]   You don't turn in your broken or nonbroken strap.
[00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:36.760]   You're just able to apparently go and get moved.
[00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:38.800]   Are you filling out a form and they give you a new one or something?
[00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:41.360]   Like double the thickness of the prior strap.
[00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:42.360]   Yeah.
[00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:43.360]   So...
[00:51:43.360 --> 00:51:44.360]   I love the Wii.
[00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:45.360]   I think it's awesome.
[00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:46.360]   Everybody loves the Wii.
[00:51:46.360 --> 00:51:47.360]   Everybody loves the Wii.
[00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:52.360]   Isn't it funny how this little company just kind of clobbered PlayStation 3?
[00:51:52.360 --> 00:51:56.000]   It's because they're making a system to play games on not like a freaking home theater.
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:57.000]   They're not selling a home theater.
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:58.000]   Yeah.
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:51:59.000]   I don't know.
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:00.720]   I've got a 17 year old and he's actually not a Wii fan.
[00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:01.720]   I like the Xbox 360.
[00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:02.720]   Xbox 360, yeah.
[00:52:02.720 --> 00:52:06.800]   I've run into a couple of people that have some qualms about the Wii.
[00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:07.800]   If you're an AT...
[00:52:07.800 --> 00:52:08.800]   The graphics sucks.
[00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:11.560]   You have to have an ATTV to make it horrible on.
[00:52:11.560 --> 00:52:12.560]   Yeah.
[00:52:12.560 --> 00:52:15.720]   Well, it looks like 1980 graphics.
[00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:18.720]   I mean, they're just amazing how we...
[00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:20.480]   It's not as good as the GameCube.
[00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:21.480]   It is the GameCube.
[00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:22.480]   It's the same.
[00:52:22.480 --> 00:52:23.480]   I think it's not the same.
[00:52:23.480 --> 00:52:24.480]   Well, it's not bad.
[00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:25.480]   It's not bad graphics.
[00:52:25.480 --> 00:52:26.480]   It's not HDTV.
[00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:30.800]   I think what Steven's trying to say is that graphics are not...
[00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:32.840]   There's nowhere near the cutting edge of the graphics.
[00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:34.360]   You can see in the 360, the 3.0, 3.
[00:52:34.360 --> 00:52:35.360]   I don't think it's supposed to be.
[00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:36.360]   That's true.
[00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:37.360]   No, it's not.
[00:52:37.360 --> 00:52:38.360]   It's all about playability.
[00:52:38.360 --> 00:52:44.520]   But for example, what we were seeing last week at Call for Help, the bowling and the...
[00:52:44.520 --> 00:52:46.760]   Yeah, but those are the freebie games.
[00:52:46.760 --> 00:52:47.760]   They didn't put any effort.
[00:52:47.760 --> 00:52:52.840]   But literally, they're conical, they're geometric shaped, conical characters walking
[00:52:52.840 --> 00:52:54.200]   around with no legs.
[00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:57.680]   I mean, like little spheres as elbows.
[00:52:57.680 --> 00:52:59.520]   It's just unbelievably bad.
[00:52:59.520 --> 00:53:00.520]   And you know what?
[00:53:00.520 --> 00:53:01.520]   It was a still...
[00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:02.520]   Maybe that's why they designed it.
[00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:05.000]   It was still a fun game.
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:06.160]   That's the point.
[00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:07.160]   People were playing it all through.
[00:53:07.160 --> 00:53:09.040]   You're a Wii hater, huh?
[00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:10.800]   Steve, I'm just a Wii unimpressed.
[00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:12.240]   I don't know.
[00:53:12.240 --> 00:53:13.240]   Under-wimmed.
[00:53:13.240 --> 00:53:14.240]   Under-wimmed.
[00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:18.640]   Although I really think that Sony has screwed up with the PS3 by creating a platform that
[00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:22.920]   is so difficult to design for that people are just going to say, "Wait a minute, let's
[00:53:22.920 --> 00:53:25.280]   just do our game through PS6 and the PC."
[00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:28.240]   It's worse than that because I think it hurts their chances with Blu-ray in the long
[00:53:28.240 --> 00:53:29.240]   run.
[00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:30.240]   I think...
[00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:31.240]   God.
[00:53:31.240 --> 00:53:32.240]   It gives HDTV a leg up.
[00:53:32.240 --> 00:53:38.840]   It might be that this is the first kind of break in the HD DVD versus Blu-ray battle.
[00:53:38.840 --> 00:53:41.720]   Well, I've got a couple of stories about that.
[00:53:41.720 --> 00:53:46.960]   Both HD DVD folks, they were in San Francisco recently and they had a big tent.
[00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:49.680]   I guess they're doing dog and pony shows all over the country.
[00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:54.640]   They got a Microsoft guy who was like the pitchman and he's good.
[00:53:54.640 --> 00:53:59.280]   And they take you in if you're invited to this thing to have a private briefing and they
[00:53:59.280 --> 00:54:03.240]   give you the sales pitch on the whole thing.
[00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:07.560]   And it's a shotgun approach with all kinds of interesting features that HD DVD has in
[00:54:07.560 --> 00:54:14.680]   one of them, which I thought to be the most interesting is the ability to skin various
[00:54:14.680 --> 00:54:16.960]   objects within a movie.
[00:54:16.960 --> 00:54:21.720]   For example, I was told that if the movie was filmed with this in mind, you could watch
[00:54:21.720 --> 00:54:26.640]   a Batman movie and put your face on Batman through the entire film.
[00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:27.640]   No.
[00:54:27.640 --> 00:54:28.640]   Yes.
[00:54:28.640 --> 00:54:31.520]   The system is actually designed to do this.
[00:54:31.520 --> 00:54:33.360]   That's funny.
[00:54:33.360 --> 00:54:36.400]   When you go with similar stuff, it's a very interesting thing.
[00:54:36.400 --> 00:54:41.200]   Well, they did show one, they have a movie, one of that Tokyo Drift or whatever it is.
[00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:45.920]   And you can actually change the colors on a couple of the cars and the cars drive around
[00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:47.080]   with a different color.
[00:54:47.080 --> 00:54:49.400]   Anyway, and it looks seamless.
[00:54:49.400 --> 00:54:50.840]   It's pretty cool actually.
[00:54:50.840 --> 00:54:56.320]   But anyway, when you confront them, meanwhile, the Blu-ray people came around with a dog and
[00:54:56.320 --> 00:55:01.720]   a pony show and they, with a lot less enthusiasm, I might add, and they're not quite as aggressive.
[00:55:01.720 --> 00:55:06.120]   But when you confront them with some of these features that HD has, and Blu-ray's argument
[00:55:06.120 --> 00:55:11.800]   basically is, well, we can store more data, and that's really all that counts.
[00:55:11.800 --> 00:55:16.400]   And they do have one thing which hasn't proven to be valuable yet, but they claim it will
[00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:19.960]   be eventually wishes that the Blu-ray players all run Java.
[00:55:19.960 --> 00:55:24.280]   And so people can code kinds of things that might not be available on HD.
[00:55:24.280 --> 00:55:28.840]   But for right now, if you put the two system side by side, just for features, HD's killing
[00:55:28.840 --> 00:55:29.840]   Blu-ray.
[00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:32.040]   Well, I think that I'm kind of feeling the same way too.
[00:55:32.040 --> 00:55:36.520]   And that's all we needed, a Blu-ray player that can now catch a virus.
[00:55:36.520 --> 00:55:40.960]   But you can now buy a Blu-ray burner, Amazon's selling them, new eggs selling them.
[00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:43.080]   They're about 500 bucks for your PC.
[00:55:43.080 --> 00:55:44.080]   They're 500?
[00:55:44.080 --> 00:55:46.920]   That means you can, it's also a Blu-ray player than also, right?
[00:55:46.920 --> 00:55:47.920]   I guess so.
[00:55:47.920 --> 00:55:49.840]   But is that for two more bucks?
[00:55:49.840 --> 00:55:51.520]   Is it external then?
[00:55:51.520 --> 00:55:54.440]   It looks like an internal drive black-faced.
[00:55:54.440 --> 00:55:56.080]   Maybe it's 600 bucks.
[00:55:56.080 --> 00:55:59.360]   I don't know what the media is, but hey, 50 gigs.
[00:55:59.360 --> 00:56:00.360]   We need this now.
[00:56:00.360 --> 00:56:03.760]   I mean, if I'm going to back up my photos, I can't fit it on one DVD or even five.
[00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:05.240]   I mean, I really hate that space.
[00:56:05.240 --> 00:56:09.280]   Well, I'm already thinking, can you get component out of the component out of the darn thing
[00:56:09.280 --> 00:56:11.280]   and play it on your TV?
[00:56:11.280 --> 00:56:12.280]   Kind of.
[00:56:12.280 --> 00:56:15.840]   That's what the HD DVD is for the Xbox 360.
[00:56:15.840 --> 00:56:17.840]   It's just kind of a bare-bones drive.
[00:56:17.840 --> 00:56:18.840]   It's 200 bucks.
[00:56:18.840 --> 00:56:19.840]   That's what I'm using.
[00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:20.840]   Hot kicks.
[00:56:20.840 --> 00:56:21.840]   It looks great.
[00:56:21.840 --> 00:56:28.080]   But you know, I don't understand why Microsoft didn't put an HDMI connector on the Xbox 360.
[00:56:28.080 --> 00:56:29.720]   I'm surprised they didn't have to.
[00:56:29.720 --> 00:56:32.480]   Did they have to with the HTC P and all that?
[00:56:32.480 --> 00:56:36.160]   Oh, by the way, I brought, that came up in the conversation too.
[00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:40.600]   In fact, I got burned for something I'd written in a PC magazine about Blu-ray, which I was
[00:56:40.600 --> 00:56:42.160]   inaccurate about.
[00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:48.400]   Apparently, nobody, or at least they're promising at the outset that no one's ever going to
[00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:54.600]   trigger that flag for HDCP.
[00:56:54.600 --> 00:56:58.600]   Sony promises that they won't do it, and everybody else is kind of backing away from
[00:56:58.600 --> 00:56:59.600]   it.
[00:56:59.600 --> 00:57:06.920]   With the HD DVD player through that Xbox there, you can run full HD out those component cables.
[00:57:06.920 --> 00:57:11.200]   At least until the next version of the Xbox, they're certainly not going to be enabling
[00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:12.520]   that flag.
[00:57:12.520 --> 00:57:18.160]   So that this version of the box doesn't need to work with the flag.
[00:57:18.160 --> 00:57:23.320]   Well, they say that these guys are promising that they're not, they said unless some terrible
[00:57:23.320 --> 00:57:27.120]   thing happens, they're not going to ever have a flag trigger.
[00:57:27.120 --> 00:57:30.320]   And Sony says they're not going to do it on any other stuff coming from Sony studios
[00:57:30.320 --> 00:57:31.320]   or Columbia.
[00:57:31.320 --> 00:57:34.040]   Well, it's the thing to promise anyway.
[00:57:34.040 --> 00:57:39.000]   I got a phone call from Sony Pictures actually.
[00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:40.800]   In fact, they got three thing.
[00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:44.840]   Sony never says anything to me, but all of a sudden I get in all these phone calls because
[00:57:44.840 --> 00:57:46.520]   of this particular issue.
[00:57:46.520 --> 00:57:50.480]   And the guy at Sony Pictures told me, look, we're not going to, we said it made a public
[00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:52.960]   announcement that we're not going to use that flag.
[00:57:52.960 --> 00:57:53.960]   Good.
[00:57:53.960 --> 00:57:56.120]   So I said, oh, okay, well, I got to rewrite the thing.
[00:57:56.120 --> 00:57:58.880]   Well, I made a promise to make all the Twitter podcast shorter.
[00:57:58.880 --> 00:57:59.960]   So we're going to wrap this thing up.
[00:57:59.960 --> 00:58:05.120]   Before we go though, farewell to Al Shugart, who was a great pioneer of the hard drive.
[00:58:05.120 --> 00:58:09.320]   In fact, in many ways, I think brought the personal hard drive to the world.
[00:58:09.320 --> 00:58:10.320]   Did he not work?
[00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:11.320]   Yeah, he really did.
[00:58:11.320 --> 00:58:13.320]   Well, and floppies before that.
[00:58:13.320 --> 00:58:14.320]   Really?
[00:58:14.320 --> 00:58:15.320]   I didn't know that.
[00:58:15.320 --> 00:58:16.320]   Shugart floppy drive.
[00:58:16.320 --> 00:58:22.440]   The first real mass media floppies that happened.
[00:58:22.440 --> 00:58:27.120]   And remember John eight inch floppies, those big monsters that are bizarre right now,
[00:58:27.120 --> 00:58:28.120]   though.
[00:58:28.120 --> 00:58:30.120]   They also did the first five and a quarter.
[00:58:30.120 --> 00:58:31.120]   Yep.
[00:58:31.120 --> 00:58:32.120]   Yep.
[00:58:32.120 --> 00:58:33.640]   And started Seagate, of course.
[00:58:33.640 --> 00:58:36.240]   Shugart was his own company.
[00:58:36.240 --> 00:58:41.840]   And Seagate's still going strong, although he was forced out some years after he started
[00:58:41.840 --> 00:58:42.840]   it.
[00:58:42.840 --> 00:58:44.840]   He was going to work away this week.
[00:58:44.840 --> 00:58:47.680]   And one of the pioneers of the computer industry.
[00:58:47.680 --> 00:58:49.520]   And a particularly nice guy.
[00:58:49.520 --> 00:58:50.520]   Really?
[00:58:50.520 --> 00:58:51.520]   Yes.
[00:58:51.520 --> 00:58:52.520]   Yeah, I never met.
[00:58:52.520 --> 00:58:53.520]   Yeah.
[00:58:53.520 --> 00:58:58.000]   Just a word, a little PSA, public service announcement from Canon.
[00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:01.080]   Turn your computer off when you go home for the holidays.
[00:59:01.080 --> 00:59:06.760]   According to Canon, enough power will be wasted in the UK alone over the 10 day Christmas
[00:59:06.760 --> 00:59:09.480]   break to roast 4.4 million turkeys.
[00:59:09.480 --> 00:59:15.680]   So turn off your computer and save a turkey or something like that.
[00:59:15.680 --> 00:59:18.200]   If you're looking for a holiday gift, it's not too late.
[00:59:18.200 --> 00:59:22.320]   We've got a special coupon code on the Scotty vest site, scotty vest.com.
[00:59:22.320 --> 00:59:25.440]   They make those great technology enabled clothing.
[00:59:25.440 --> 00:59:27.560]   I wear a lot of ski and Scotty based stuff.
[00:59:27.560 --> 00:59:33.440]   The 20% off if you use the coupon, Twit, T W I T. And that's good through Christmas.
[00:59:33.440 --> 00:59:36.680]   In fact, I'll put a special link on the show notes for that.
[00:59:36.680 --> 00:59:38.440]   And it'll hold your new iPhone.
[00:59:38.440 --> 00:59:43.120]   It'll hold your new iPhone, which I predict will be out tomorrow.
[00:59:43.120 --> 00:59:44.600]   Want to thank, that's my prediction.
[00:59:44.600 --> 00:59:47.760]   I want to thank Dell for providing support for this podcast.
[00:59:47.760 --> 00:59:48.760]   Yes, there's still weather.
[00:59:48.760 --> 00:59:52.240]   Ladies and gentlemen, for a week or two more, they've been a great sponsor for the last
[00:59:52.240 --> 00:59:54.840]   three months on the Twitnet Cast network.
[00:59:54.840 --> 00:59:58.880]   We do have Twit pics, my pics at twit.tv/del.
[00:59:58.880 --> 01:00:02.000]   The Dell XPS we just bought for call for help in the laptop that I've been running this
[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.000]   on.
[01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:07.880]   In fact, my project this afternoon after we finish up is to put a Windows 64 on my
[01:00:07.880 --> 01:00:10.200]   Dell XPS M1210.
[01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:11.240]   So I'll let you know how that goes.
[01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:13.080]   I just downloaded Windows 64.
[01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:14.080]   Ooh, I'm excited.
[01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:16.720]   Oh, this is going to be fun.
[01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:18.400]   Ooh, the thrill.
[01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:20.040]   John C. Devorak, what are you doing?
[01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:21.040]   We're taking next week.
[01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:22.040]   I should say we're taking next week off.
[01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:24.040]   We're not going to do a show on Christmas Day.
[01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:25.040]   That's nuts.
[01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:29.560]   But we will be back on New Year's Day with a look back at 2006 and a look ahead to 2007.
[01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:33.200]   The top stories of the year, a special Twit at the end of the year.
[01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:37.200]   Maybe we'll be fun if I can go back through the old Twits to have little clips of us making
[01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:38.560]   the wrong predictions all year long.
[01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:39.560]   A clip show.
[01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:43.360]   We already did a clip show, but I don't know if I'll do a whole clip show.
[01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:46.120]   I think we'll do a real show, but we'll talk about it.
[01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:47.120]   Maybe I don't think we should.
[01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:48.960]   I think you should avoid that.
[01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:50.880]   We already made enough mistakes.
[01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:53.240]   So let's not rub it in, is that what you're saying?
[01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:55.160]   That's somebody else.
[01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:59.320]   Devorak.org/blog for a great bunch of fun postings.
[01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:00.320]   It's always a great read.
[01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:05.080]   You could catch John on MarketWatch.com and the NPC Magazine.
[01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:06.080]   Have a happy holiday.
[01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:07.080]   Merry Christmas, John.
[01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:08.080]   It's a shame to everybody.
[01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:09.080]   What are you doing for Christmas?
[01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:10.080]   Anything special?
[01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:14.120]   No, we're just going to have everybody, family gathering and that's about it.
[01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:16.760]   I want to thank Steve Gibson for joining us.
[01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:17.960]   We haven't had John Twit in so long.
[01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:18.960]   It's so good to have you on.
[01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:20.640]   Glad to be back, Neil.
[01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:23.280]   Have a happy holiday and merry Christmas.
[01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:28.680]   And of course, Steve's determined to outpace Twit and we're going to continue to produce
[01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:29.680]   security now.
[01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:31.360]   The rest of the network is going to be dead.
[01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:32.360]   Why?
[01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:33.360]   No show.
[01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:34.360]   Shuttered.
[01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:36.880]   No, Steve's got to keep on going on.
[01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:41.120]   So I'll be posting, I'll be in Mexico, but I'll be posting security now every Thursday
[01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:42.120]   from now.
[01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:43.120]   May he go.
[01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:44.120]   May he go.
[01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:46.320]   I'm leaving on Wednesday to Porto Escondido for a little surfing.
[01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:48.280]   Oh, have a great time.
[01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:49.280]   Thank you.
[01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:50.280]   What do you do?
[01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:53.600]   Kevin, by the way, Steve's site, great site, grc.com.
[01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:57.000]   He's got a lot of good free security software there, but also the ultimate disc recovery and
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.360]   maintenance utility spin right.
[01:01:58.360 --> 01:02:01.280]   I want to give you a plug because that's a great, great program.
[01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:02.280]   GRC.com.
[01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:03.440]   What are you doing, Kevin?
[01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:06.080]   David, are you heading out for the holidays?
[01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:09.120]   Just going down to San Diego and then that's where your home is.
[01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:11.640]   Hopefully up in, I think up in Tahoe for the New Year.
[01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:13.560]   I'll wave to you as I fly over.
[01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:14.560]   Thank you.
[01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:20.600]   Revision3.com and make sure you check out dig.com Monday for the big iPhone announcement.
[01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:23.080]   No, no, for all the new features.
[01:02:23.080 --> 01:02:24.080]   All the new features.
[01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:29.040]   Something exciting that Kevin has been hitting at for months and finally happens.
[01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:31.280]   Yeah, Kevin's excited about this too.
[01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:32.280]   He is.
[01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:33.280]   Yeah.
[01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:35.520]   Whatever it is, it's, he's really thinking it's going to be good stuff.
[01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:36.520]   Kevin Creewell.
[01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:37.520]   Kevin 2.0.
[01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:38.520]   Kevin 2.0 from NVIDIA.
[01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:39.520]   Thank you so much for being with us.
[01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:40.520]   It's always great to have you on.
[01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:41.520]   We'll come back again soon.
[01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:44.520]   I want to talk more about the fusion and also what NVIDIA is up to.
[01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:53.920]   Oh, it's a pleasure to be here and have a happy holiday yourself.
[01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:54.920]   You too.
[01:02:54.920 --> 01:02:55.920]   Happy holidays.
[01:02:55.920 --> 01:02:56.920]   Happy holidays to everybody.
[01:02:56.920 --> 01:02:57.920]   Mary Kwanzaa, Festivus.
[01:02:57.920 --> 01:03:04.000]   Enjoy your metal pole and your feats of strength.
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:05.000]   It's Kwanzaa.
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:06.200]   Did I miss anything?
[01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:07.880]   Oh, Christmas, winter solstice.
[01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:08.880]   Honeka.
[01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:09.880]   Honeka.
[01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:14.320]   We're in the middle of Honeka right now and I've got 12 gifts just for you, John.
[01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:16.200]   And hot dog eating competition.
[01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:18.560]   There's a big hot dog eating competition coming out usually.
[01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:22.280]   A little later on on this very same network.
[01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:23.320]   I'm Leo LePorte.
[01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:25.000]   Have a great holiday.
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:32.880]   We'll see you for a New Year's Day for a brand new year of Twits and Adam Curry.
[01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:36.080]   I hope you listen to the whole thing because John was on the show this week.
[01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:38.080]   So we did that just for you.
[01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:39.080]   Another Twit.
[01:03:39.080 --> 01:03:43.120]   This week in Tech is in the Can.
[01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:46.840]   This week.
[01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:52.320]   This week.
[01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:56.160]   This week.
[01:03:56.160 --> 01:03:58.520]   This is a craps society.
[01:03:58.520 --> 01:04:09.240]   This is a craps society.
[01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:16.480]   You remember I went on this kind of off topic thing about getting a sweater from Reiki.
[01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:17.480]   Is that still alive?
[01:04:17.480 --> 01:04:19.160]   Well, you know, it turns out to be a pleasure.
[01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:20.880]   He wants the Hard Rock Cafe.
[01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:21.880]   Yeah, it doesn't.
[01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:22.880]   It's never going to happen.
[01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:23.880]   I remember that.
[01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:24.880]   It's my old sweater soon.
[01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:25.880]   So, yeah, it's been long gone.
[01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:27.880]   And now when somebody bought Hard Rock Cafe.
[01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:28.880]   The Indians.
[01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:29.880]   Right, exactly.
[01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:30.880]   The Seminoles.
[01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:36.560]   But anyway, so I'm thinking, well, where else can I bake for clothes?
[01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:40.400]   And I realize, you know, the cool thing you get right now, I think.
[01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:41.400]   And that's just a challenge.
[01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:43.920]   Let's see if there's any listeners out there.
[01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:46.640]   From Appalachian State.
[01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:51.880]   Which won the Division 1 football championship with a really good game.
[01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:54.320]   In fact, they run a spread offense that's very aggressive.
[01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:56.720]   It was a fun game to watch one of the best games of all year.
[01:04:56.720 --> 01:04:58.720]   And it wasn't Division 1.
[01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:01.720]   It was Division 1 A. It was Division 1 A. It was Division 1, which used to be Division
[01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:02.720]   1 AA.
[01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:05.800]   But anyways, if anybody out there gets me a hoodie.
[01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:08.720]   He wants an Appalachian State hoodie.
[01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:10.720]   Picture myself wearing it.
[01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:13.720]   Now, how would they get that to you?
[01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:17.480]   Probably can email me at john@theborect.org and we can arrange something.
[01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:19.480]   I hand off over your range.
[01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:20.480]   But you know what?
[01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:21.480]   It's going to be just like the other thing.
[01:05:21.480 --> 01:05:22.960]   I'm never going to get this thing in mind.
[01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:26.440]   So maybe somebody who has to send us a cheese and some get me out the hoodie.
[01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:27.440]   It's like a woldie.
[01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:28.440]   Why you mass?
[01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:29.440]   They came in second.
[01:05:29.440 --> 01:05:32.440]   They lost the Appalachian State.
[01:05:32.440 --> 01:05:34.440]   Oh, that's so sad.
[01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:37.440]   Has anybody else wanted a bag for anything while we're here?
[01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:38.440]   No.
[01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:40.440]   Anything anybody, Bueller?
[01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:41.440]   It's not begging.
[01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:42.440]   It's suggesting.
[01:05:42.440 --> 01:05:43.440]   Bueller.
[01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:44.440]   Oh, geez.
[01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:46.440]   Last chance.
[01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:47.440]   It's getting fast.
[01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:48.440]   Christmas gifts, anybody?
[01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:51.440]   There's no other way of getting this thing.
[01:05:51.440 --> 01:05:53.440]   You want to do it?
[01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:54.440]   Alright.
[01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:56.440]   Do it in the twin, baby.
[01:05:56.440 --> 01:05:58.440]   Do it in the twin.
[01:05:58.440 --> 01:05:59.440]   Alright.
[01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:00.440]   Do it in the twin, baby.
[01:06:00.440 --> 01:06:01.440]   Do it in the twin.
[01:06:01.440 --> 01:06:02.440]   Alright.
[01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:03.440]   Do it in the twin, baby.
[01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:04.440]   Do it in the twin.
[01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:05.440]   Alright.
[01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:06.440]   Do it in the twin, baby.
[01:06:06.440 --> 01:06:07.440]   Do it in the twin.
[01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:08.440]   Alright.
[01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:09.440]   Do it in the twin, baby.
[01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:10.440]   Alright.
[01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:11.440]   Do it in the twin, baby.
[01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:13.440]   Thanks, David.
