[00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.600]   Did you recover from CES?
[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.000]   As much as I'm going to.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.960]   Came back from CES to a teething child.
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.280]   And it's been very exciting.

[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:54.920]   Yeah, it was fun.
[00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.320]   Went to the Jonathan Colton concert.
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.320]   Good time.
[00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:58.320]   It was a lot of fun.
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.320]   I really enjoyed it.
[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.640]   But it was a long, late show.
[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.920]   It was a lengthy show.
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.640]   And never make Jonathan Colton humor on Twitter.
[00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.040]   What was Jonathan Colton humor?
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:10.040]   What are you talking about?
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:13.680]   Patrick made a mistake of saying who is Jonathan Colton on Twitter.
[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.240]   Who says Jonathan Colton, guys?
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.040]   You're here to play for David Prager's birthday.
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.520]   I got some release.
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.760]   Historical emails as a result.
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.320]   You know what you really see at a Colton concert is that there is a cult.
[00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.320]   Yeah.
[00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.920]   Kind of a geek cult.
[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.400]   Most definitely are humorless.
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.400]   They're OCD.
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.000]   No, they're very humor full as long as you're not making fun of their guy.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.520]   Yeah, they love Jonathan.
[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.160]   No, it's really, it's fun.
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.200]   They sing everything perfectly and they know every song.
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.240]   I would say perfectly by heart.
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.240]   It's a little weird.
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.520]   Jonathan said to say hello.
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.520]   You know, with pocket protectors and well-groomed hair?
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.800]   No, well, they are well-groomed.
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:58.360]   There was a, I talked to a guy who works at Apple, a woman who works at FARC.com.
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.440]   It was, you know, it was the tech.
[00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.680]   Glitterati, you interviewed Jonathan this afternoon, didn't you?
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.640]   Yeah, we had him on East mean twist just earlier.
[00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.840]   He said to say hello and Paul and Storm said they would like to be on Twitter someday.
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.320]   Oh, I love Paul and Storm.
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.320]   Were Paul and Storm there too?
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.320]   Yeah, they tagged along.
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.320]   It was great.
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.720]   You can't go anywhere without them now.
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:19.720]   Oh, good.
[00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.000]   I'll call Paul and Storm.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   I think they're hysterical.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.200]   Yeah, they're funny guys.
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.200]   Yeah.
[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.440]   They met on the internet.
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.440]   Really?
[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:27.440]   Yeah.
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:28.440]   Wow.
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.960]   It was sort of a, they saw Hodgeman on the daily show and followed the trail until they found
[00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:35.200]   Jonathan and then showed up at, you know, or started emailing him or something.
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.000]   I think he was doing the thing a week back then.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.920]   So is there any news this week?
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.120]   Yeah, there's a little bit.
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.480]   I thought, you know, it's funny after CES and Comdex is going to be quiet and it turns
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:51.680]   out this is possibly the biggest tech news week of the year, even bigger than last week.
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.760]   First of all, Steve Jobs lets the other shoe drop, sends a letter out saying, yeah, it
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:57.760]   turns out I am pretty sick.
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:03.440]   I'm going to take six months off and Tim Cook's going to run the company and really kind of
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.120]   a shock to everybody.
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.120]   I don't want to speculate on his health because now we know it's serious enough.
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.720]   He's taken the time off.
[00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:12.720]   So we wish him well.
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.040]   And this guy is key to the technology industry.
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.200]   He was a huge pioneer.
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.280]   Still is very important and we wish him the best.
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.960]   However, it sure, sure is a kerfuffle in the tech community.
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.760]   Gizmodo howls at, at Jim Goldman of CNBC.
[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.680]   Remember Jim Goldman published a blog post saying, leave off Steve Jobs.
[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:40.680]   My sources say he's fine and gizmodo is full of it for saying he's not.
[00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.040]   Turns out he wasn't so fine.
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:47.080]   Fake Steve Jobs, Dan Lyons comes on CNBC and says, admit you were wrong, Goldman.
[00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.640]   You were punked.
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:53.080]   Your sources as Apple PR, they fooled you.
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.720]   And Goldman said, no, I was right.
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:55.720]   I was right.
[00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.560]   I'm not wrong.
[00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:03.840]   And Brian Lamb at Gizmodo writes a post that looks like he's a Looney Tunes.
[00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.480]   Did you see the Gizmodo post about all this?
[00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.480]   It was just like he'd lost it.
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:13.080]   Well, you know, I think he was just feeling very emotional about it.
[00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.960]   It was a very emotional post.
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:22.120]   Can we stop for a second and review your imitation of Jim Goldman?
[00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.400]   Now we all worked with Jim Goldman.
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:25.400]   Jim is true.
[00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:30.000]   I saw that bit between him and Lyons and it's floating around the web.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.680]   And Goldman was pretty calm and collected and his comment I think was pretty straightforward
[00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.040]   when he says, look, what am I supposed to do?
[00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.440]   I've got no information to the contrary.
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:40.920]   I'm just reporting what I'm reporting.
[00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:41.920]   No speculation.
[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:48.920]   And that's BS because Goldman slammed everybody for speculating at Jobs Health saying, my sources
[00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.840]   say he's fine.
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:55.480]   Turns out he has no, his sources are Apple PR as far as I'm concerned.
[00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:56.480]   He was punked.
[00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:57.480]   Oh, you don't know.
[00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:58.480]   Well, okay.
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.680]   So so he believed something that was not so.
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:06.000]   Well, and yelled at people for, they're not, you know, saying your sources are crap.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.600]   My sources are good.
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.920]   You got it wrong.
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:15.240]   And then any normal guy would come back and say, yeah, okay, well, you're right.
[00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.800]   I was lied to by my sources.
[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.320]   Like obviously he's not healthy.
[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:19.320]   But no, he continues.
[00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:24.680]   I've seen a lot of journalists would never ever own up to actually getting a, you know,
[00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:25.680]   story.
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.000]   I mean, you never see retractions on national news.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   They bury him in the auto.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.160]   They're under the bottom of the editorial of the mail page in magazines.
[00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:40.600]   You know, and he was probably pissed off at having fake Steve Jobs cornering on camera.
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.280]   Well, there we was.
[00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:45.800]   Initially Dan Lyons says I've now been banned from CNBC later.
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.000]   CNBC spokesman said we wasn't.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   You don't believe it.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.960]   That's another publicity stunt by Dan Lyons.
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:52.160]   The guy's a master.
[00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:53.160]   Oh, interesting.
[00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:54.840]   Well, and hasn't one was?
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:07:00.480]   Niac said lately sort of given Jim Goldman a little bit, a little bit of an out when he's
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:03.120]   like, look, yeah, I'm taking Steve on face value.
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:07.440]   If he says that this has been the way it's been all along and it hasn't been any different,
[00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:08.920]   then I'm going to believe him.
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:12.280]   Obviously there's a different relationship there, but Goldman can say like that's all
[00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:13.280]   I was doing.
[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:16.080]   If they told me he's fine, I had to believe he was fine.
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:20.640]   Well, maybe he shouldn't have cast getting other journalists who have different sources.
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:21.640]   Sorry.
[00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:27.760]   Well, I'm expecting that monkey in the closet, a family guy to come out and point the finger.
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:33.080]   Well, it's really, I mean, the more interesting story is what's going to happen to Apple.
[00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:37.120]   Over the next six months, whether Jim Goldman and Gizmodo have a fight or not.
[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.120]   Right.
[00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:41.960]   That's more interesting story, which is what I did a column in MarketWatch that discusses
[00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:47.040]   what I think, which I think it's a foregone conclusion that Apple's got two years, about
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:48.040]   two years left.
[00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:51.120]   Of course, everybody, oh, that's all you ever say.
[00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:53.640]   But you know, because they have stuff in the pipeline and they should be able to do just
[00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:54.640]   fine for a while.
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:59.360]   Well, at some point, Steve Jobs, if you don't want to believe it or not, when he came into
[00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:02.920]   the company, what was the '96?
[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:05.520]   It was like the turnaround was obvious.
[00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:11.320]   The company was floundering and he cut down the SKUs and came up with some good products
[00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:15.040]   and pushed the company in the right direction and kept it on course and came up with new
[00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:17.360]   ideas and started as a platform.
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:22.560]   The question is, do they need Steve at the helm to continue making intelligent decisions?
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:26.440]   No doubt that Steve came in, took names and kicked ass and straightened a lot of messy
[00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:32.160]   stuff out, especially like competing SKUs across retail and commercial and educational.
[00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:36.400]   The seven different models of the same computer with three different name sets and four different
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:37.400]   numbering methodologies.
[00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:40.400]   I mean, it's amazing what he came in and did in '98.
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:42.760]   It's phenomenal what he'd done by '98.
[00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:46.200]   But do they really need Steve to continue to make great products?
[00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:51.280]   Well, he's probably been smarter about it now that he's been through one collapse of
[00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:57.080]   his company as far as making sure that he's breeding people that do things the way he
[00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:59.280]   thinks they need to be done.
[00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:03.760]   The big question that none of us can answer is with him not around to correct them, even
[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:08.000]   if it's slightly or subtly or just by his presence, make them think a different way.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.760]   Are they going to be able to carry out that same way of doing business?
[00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:16.520]   I think that's the big difference, John, between this time and last time.
[00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:21.080]   Last time Jobs was forced out by John Scully who didn't know nearly knew.
[00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:23.480]   So it was dumb enough to force Jobs out.
[00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:25.320]   That just shows you how stupid he was.
[00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:26.320]   And Miss.
[00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:27.320]   Miss.
[00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:28.320]   Mr. Anthony.
[00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:29.320]   This is different.
[00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:30.320]   This is different.
[00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:31.320]   This time Jobs exactly has prepared this.
[00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:34.520]   They've been preparing this transition since he first got cancer.
[00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:38.560]   I think it's, he's got a team in place that he put there as opposed to the team in place
[00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:39.760]   that threw him out.
[00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:40.760]   That's a big difference.
[00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:42.600]   He put everybody there too beforehand.
[00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:44.160]   But that's beside the point.
[00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:45.280]   Let's take a vote.
[00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:49.160]   How many people think two years from now Apple is going to be better than it is today, a
[00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:54.120]   better company solid on firm footing and how many think it's not?
[00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:56.320]   Is there a middle where it's like the same?
[00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:57.320]   Okay.
[00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:58.320]   Take it.
[00:09:58.320 --> 00:09:59.480]   Give you a choice of three.
[00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:01.160]   I don't think it's going to go downhill.
[00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:02.160]   Okay.
[00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:03.160]   I think it is.
[00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:05.840]   First of all, first of all, you're assuming that Steve's not coming back, right?
[00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:06.840]   Yeah.
[00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:07.840]   Okay.
[00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:09.880]   So maybe the first question is, is Steve coming back?
[00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:12.940]   Well, Steve comes back as a different story, but we're assuming he's not coming back in
[00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:13.940]   this argument.
[00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:17.980]   Can I ask a related kind of question before we vote on this, John?
[00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:21.640]   Are we all convinced that, I mean, above and beyond the ass kicking in the early days
[00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:25.860]   and getting the company online, are we all convinced that Steve was responsible for green
[00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:29.880]   lighting every decent product that they've come up with in the last decade?
[00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:32.320]   Is he been personally responsible for making that happen?
[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:33.560]   That's a scotter, right?
[00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:37.780]   I think he green lights, personally responsible for making him happen, maybe, maybe not.
[00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:42.960]   But I think from what I've heard, he sits in on everything and says yes or no.
[00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:45.420]   So basically the myth is true.
[00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:47.340]   Well, yeah, I don't know.
[00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:48.340]   You don't.
[00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:49.340]   Do you know?
[00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:55.540]   No, I'm just asking that there's a 67% chance that the myth is true.
[00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:56.540]   The people not 68?
[00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:59.100]   No, the people calling it right there.
[00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:04.100]   The people I know who work at Apple and who have worked at Apple all agree.
[00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:09.660]   Steve Jobs is the final arbiter of everything from the brand of T-shirt in the company's
[00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:13.160]   store to the product that's coming out next year.
[00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:16.960]   So I think it's true that you pull Steve Jobs out of the mix.
[00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:18.240]   It's a different company.
[00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:23.080]   The only question is, can anybody else be as good as Steve Jobs and can as Steve put
[00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:26.160]   in place a team that can match his performance?
[00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:27.160]   And I think so.
[00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:28.160]   I think so.
[00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:29.960]   I think Apple will be as good or better.
[00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:30.960]   You're changing it.
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:31.960]   No, I'm not changing.
[00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:32.960]   That's my...
[00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:33.960]   You up-
[00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:34.960]   I didn't vote.
[00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:35.960]   Oh, you didn't vote.
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:36.960]   I said, what are the choices?
[00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:39.440]   My vote is as good, greater than or equal to.
[00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:41.620]   I think in two years they'll probably be doing okay.
[00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:43.900]   I think they'll be still on solid footing.
[00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:50.660]   But I think that what Steve Jobs is good at is not just the leadership issue, but sort
[00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:57.220]   of the inspired decision of when to stop something, when to go into a product line,
[00:11:57.220 --> 00:12:02.980]   when to get rid of buttons, whatever his little OCD behaviors are, they tend to be inspired.
[00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:04.300]   And that's going to fade.
[00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:08.780]   I think it's going to fade over a longer period than two years and maybe I call it five, something
[00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:09.780]   like that.
[00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:12.220]   Yeah, but then what you don't know is another person going to come along with that vision
[00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:13.220]   or not.
[00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:14.220]   True.
[00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:15.220]   It's not.
[00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:18.300]   So two years is a reasonable time frame because that's the jobs halo.
[00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:19.300]   That's the pride.
[00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:22.700]   They've got products and development set for two years out probably already, I'm guessing.
[00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:23.700]   I think that's all the time.
[00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:28.620]   And I think Apple's got a room with that vision than somebody who can actually execute on
[00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:31.460]   that vision and is in a position to make those calls.
[00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:34.180]   Five years from now everything changes and who knows.
[00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:37.220]   It's very hard to predict what's going to happen in five years.
[00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:40.260]   Steve Jobs leaving the company's a bigger deal than Bill Gates leaving Microsoft.
[00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:41.460]   I'll give you that.
[00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:43.180]   I'm not sure about that either.
[00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:47.580]   Oh, I think Microsoft's taking a turn for the better without Bill Gates.
[00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:49.740]   That's been a boon for Microsoft.
[00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:51.060]   I'm not seeing it.
[00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:55.300]   I think the vista fiasco could be laid squarely on Gates shoulder and now that he's gone Windows
[00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:57.940]   7, is a complete turnaround.
[00:12:57.940 --> 00:12:59.500]   We'll see.
[00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:02.220]   I think people are overhyping the Windows 7 turnaround.
[00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:03.940]   Is that what you're going to say Patrick?
[00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:04.940]   Yeah.
[00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:08.020]   I think Windows 7, first of all Windows 7 hasn't shipped yet.
[00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:13.580]   Second of all, I think Windows 7 is a complete reaction to what essentially vista may not
[00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:17.300]   have failed as an operating system but has absolutely failed as a brand.
[00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:19.140]   It has not gained unless something's changed.
[00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:22.260]   Maybe John, you can address this unless something's changed in enterprise.
[00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.660]   It has not gained traction in enterprise which is where a huge amount of the licenses
[00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:26.660]   are.
[00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:29.100]   So I think Microsoft just saying screw it.
[00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:30.100]   Let's go to the next one.
[00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:31.100]   That's exactly right.
[00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:32.100]   Let's clean up as much as we can.
[00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:33.100]   And seven addresses.
[00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:34.100]   And let's get a...
[00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:35.100]   Yeah.
[00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:38.620]   And that's why I'm bullish because seven addresses all of those issues.
[00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:40.620]   It is the next Windows 2000.
[00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:42.460]   It's the Windows 2000, the last version.
[00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:46.580]   Why is Gates to blame instead of Alchin for not saying, "Look, we need another three
[00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:48.460]   years for the operating system"?
[00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:52.780]   Well, now, and I'm basing this on what Robert Skowbel told me from his time at Microsoft.
[00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:57.580]   It was his impression that it was Alchin, absolutely, and Gates, who really created the
[00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:02.460]   vista fiasco with WinFS and all of the plans for what vista was going to be.
[00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:06.340]   And they had to pull back.
[00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:07.900]   They had to tear down.
[00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:09.020]   That's why it took five years.
[00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:11.260]   They had to release vista before it was done.
[00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:12.540]   There's no question about that.
[00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:15.580]   It's taken two years to get vista to the point where it should have been released in
[00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:17.060]   the first place.
[00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:20.340]   All of that stuff's being redesigned, rejiggered.
[00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:25.420]   If you play with seven now, I want to start a campaign to release seven now.
[00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:27.460]   Beta is very clean, very strong.
[00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:32.980]   And to me, it's exactly what business is looking for, a clean, reliable Windows.
[00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:40.260]   It seems pretty yippee, but have you put it through its paces installing software and
[00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:41.980]   running heavy software yet, Leo?
[00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:43.540]   Well, yes and no.
[00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:47.380]   I've got it installed on two virtual machines and one laptop.
[00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:48.380]   It's running very well.
[00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:51.020]   I put the stuff that I use day to day on it and it runs very well.
[00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:52.460]   I had any problems with it.
[00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:53.980]   I haven't put office on it yet.
[00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:57.020]   I'm not using it as a production machine yet, because mostly I'm Mac.
[00:14:57.020 --> 00:15:00.220]   That's kind of the next thing I want to do, because I like you have been very impressed
[00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:01.820]   with it so far.
[00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:03.420]   Just how zippy it is.
[00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:06.820]   They've basically taken vista and polished it up and cleaned it up and made it work a
[00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:07.820]   little better.
[00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:11.380]   But I still want to see if it can handle the heavier use that I would put up here.
[00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:12.580]   It runs nicely on a netbook.
[00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:15.700]   I'm going to put it on a netbook and see, but it seems to run very nicely on a netbook,
[00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:17.820]   which is a very low end platform.
[00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:18.820]   One gigabyte of RAM.
[00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:25.540]   Did Microsoft just, you know, did the reach exceed their grasp with vista that he just
[00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:28.340]   tried to change too much at too fundamental level all at once?
[00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:29.340]   Yes, and it flopped.
[00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:32.940]   Then they had to go backwards and start over again.
[00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:35.540]   And they shipped late because of the pressure to ship.
[00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:37.540]   They shipped unfinished.
[00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:43.420]   Vista, yeah, I think Vista was just from start to finish Microsoft screwed up.
[00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:46.140]   They also screwed up on the messaging.
[00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:47.540]   In every way they screwed up.
[00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:51.620]   They set expectations so high with this and then just kept pulling features out right
[00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:52.620]   and left.
[00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:53.620]   Right.
[00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:56.780]   It was almost set up to be a disappointment right from the beginning.
[00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:59.540]   The best you could say is Vista's okay now.
[00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:01.700]   But that's two years down the road.
[00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:05.060]   And it's so funny because so much of what they got hammered on in Vista is stuff that
[00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:10.740]   would have been enormously difficult for the end user to notice in real life, I think.
[00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:14.540]   Maybe I know a lot of end users, a lot of end users who hate Vista.
[00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:15.540]   Who hate?
[00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:17.140]   No, no, no, no, I don't mean Vista didn't have problems.
[00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:20.180]   I mean, like, you know, the win F-S, some of the other.
[00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:21.740]   Oh, yeah, nobody would have noticed nuances.
[00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:26.740]   I don't know if anybody ever would have really appreciated those without being told that they
[00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:28.540]   were there or told that they were not there.
[00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:32.140]   But anyway, that's my point is that I think in some ways Bill Gates wasn't the, look,
[00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:34.260]   he didn't get the internet.
[00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:36.100]   He seems to have screwed up with Vista.
[00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:41.420]   I think Microsoft will have, I would predict, have a better direction without him.
[00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:46.420]   And so that's my point is that jobs leaving Apple is a much bigger deal than Gates leaving
[00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:47.420]   Microsoft.
[00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:49.020]   But I think Apple can still survive it.
[00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:52.260]   I don't think that for one thing, we're in an evolutionary stage.
[00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:55.540]   Apple may not be a revolutionary company ever again.
[00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:58.940]   You could give jobs credit for three major revolutions.
[00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:00.900]   Without him, you don't have a personal computer revolution.
[00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:02.180]   I mean, it's one thing to invent it.
[00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:04.980]   He's the guy who marketed it and made a business out of it.
[00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:08.780]   Without him, the music industry wouldn't have changed so dramatically because of the iPod
[00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:09.780]   and iTunes.
[00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:11.260]   I mean, that's incredible.
[00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:15.420]   And I think you're seeing a complete transformation in portable computing with the iPhone now.
[00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:18.580]   And I think all three of those credit to the guy who makes the business out of, makes
[00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:20.180]   the market out of it.
[00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:23.060]   They weren't the first portable, they weren't the first smartphone, they weren't the first
[00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:26.540]   MP3 player, they weren't the first personal computer, but they were the ones who made it
[00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:27.540]   happen.
[00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:30.340]   And I think that's Steve Jobs right there.
[00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:31.340]   That's what we'll miss.
[00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:33.420]   Did you just go through all that?
[00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:35.060]   Or that much between the iPod?
[00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:36.060]   I didn't mention the iPod.
[00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:37.060]   That's the second one.
[00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:40.140]   That's the revolution in the music industry.
[00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:42.500]   So no, I think he didn't mention the cube.
[00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:44.340]   I did not mention the cube.
[00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:45.820]   Was the cube jobs or skull?
[00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:46.820]   That was jobs, wasn't it?
[00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:47.820]   You want to make a next cube?
[00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:48.820]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:50.100]   The cube was wonderful.
[00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:53.500]   It just cracked.
[00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:55.180]   That was really what was wrong.
[00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:58.780]   They couldn't make it without cracks in it.
[00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:00.860]   Anyway, so, okay, there you go.
[00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:01.860]   John, what's your vote?
[00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:03.540]   You say Apple will be worse in two years?
[00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:04.540]   Yeah.
[00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:06.420]   I see that's the beginning of the end.
[00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:07.420]   The beginning of the end.
[00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:08.420]   Oh, I hear you.
[00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:09.420]   Here come the emails.
[00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:10.420]   Never mind.
[00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:11.420]   Sell your Apple stock.
[00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:12.740]   You know what the sell now, you could still go up.
[00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:14.980]   I mean, you might be a bargain basement time is it?
[00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:19.300]   Because especially something bad happens to Steve, the stock will probably take a nice
[00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:20.300]   fall and bounce right back down.
[00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:21.700]   It only went down like 7%.
[00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:23.820]   I thought it was going to go down a lot more with that.
[00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:25.580]   Well, you know, they're still looking.
[00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:28.020]   You know, people are pretty far down considering.
[00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:29.540]   Maybe it was already in the price.
[00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:31.500]   People kind of expected this is what was going on.
[00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:32.500]   You know what?
[00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:38.420]   Apple dropped more in the last six months with the rest of the economy than it did.
[00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:43.900]   I mean, if you look at what happened between like, you know, June and December versus what
[00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:48.180]   happened in the last week, the last week is imperceptible.
[00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:51.500]   What if Steve Jobs does come back, John?
[00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:54.020]   All bets are off.
[00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:55.020]   What if he comes back?
[00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:56.020]   Yeah.
[00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:59.500]   I mean, do you think Apple becomes stronger from him having time away?
[00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:01.420]   That's an interesting question.
[00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:02.420]   I don't think so.
[00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:03.420]   I think it'll just be the same.
[00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:04.420]   What we just the continuation.
[00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:05.420]   I think he's going to.
[00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:09.740]   He's not like a football player to spend sideline in and he gets a second wind.
[00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:11.060]   I mean, I can't see that.
[00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:12.260]   Well, here's the real question.
[00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:18.100]   If it has jobs really put into place a transition team or I mean, this sometimes happens with
[00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:22.780]   a guy who's so invested in so much the leader of a company when he leaves, nobody in the
[00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:27.780]   company has any initiative and it can't succeed because it's just-
[00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:29.620]   That's what I'm thinking.
[00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:30.620]   Yeah.
[00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:34.920]   I mean, that's a symptom of a command and control sort of personality, which is what he is
[00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:35.920]   reputed to have.
[00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:36.920]   Exactly.
[00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:37.920]   Right.
[00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:40.500]   But he's also a smart guy and I think that, you know, they saw the writing on the wall.
[00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:43.340]   It's been what four years since the cancer first happened.
[00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:46.620]   I think at that point, they brought in Tim Cook.
[00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:47.780]   They kind of groom him.
[00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:48.780]   They groom Schiller.
[00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:51.420]   Anyway, it's, you know, it's sad.
[00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:57.900]   I hope Steve gets better and it's just, you know, he doesn't look good and it's very
[00:19:57.900 --> 00:19:59.180]   scary and very sad.
[00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:00.180]   So where's Spindler?
[00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:01.180]   Maybe we should dig him up and-
[00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:02.180]   Spindler.
[00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:03.180]   What ever happened to him?
[00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:04.780]   I'd like to know.
[00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:05.780]   Hash Spindler.
[00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:07.300]   He's probably working for Sheemons.
[00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:09.300]   He's still under the desk.
[00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:11.300]   Doesn't he have a list?
[00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:12.300]   Shindler.
[00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:13.300]   Spindler's list.
[00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:15.300]   Now that would be a funny movie.
[00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:18.260]   Tom, do you think Apple will be better or worse in the two years?
[00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:19.260]   I think about the same.
[00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:25.180]   I think they might be worse in five, but I think in two, they'll be drifting, they'll
[00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:27.980]   be with inertia doing about the same.
[00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:31.500]   And I guess you can interpret that as worse in Wall Street terms because Wall Street will
[00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:34.820]   be wanting them to grow by leaps and bounds and then might be treading water a little
[00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:35.820]   bit.
[00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:37.980]   How about you, Patrick?
[00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:41.660]   I'm always- I'm still amazed.
[00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:44.860]   I lived on Apple between '90 and '95 by '98.
[00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:47.260]   I was accepting that they were going away.
[00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:52.020]   At this point, it's been so extraordinary to watch the last 10 years.
[00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:56.980]   How does any company maintain that level of excellence for so long?
[00:20:56.980 --> 00:20:59.900]   In some ways, there's been a bunch of stuff that Apple does that I haven't been real
[00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:03.780]   pleased with and I haven't really seen as a sign of excellence.
[00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:10.300]   So the question is, can any company keep delivering CE products that redefine a genre
[00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:12.700]   or take over?
[00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:16.300]   By the way, if you hear some munching, Seamus just woke up and started chewing on Apple.
[00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:18.140]   Well, it's Seamus's take for two years, doesn't it?
[00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:20.540]   Seamus, Seamus, what do you think they're going to be in two years?
[00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:21.540]   The tide breaker.
[00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:22.540]   You don't know?
[00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:23.540]   That was a no.
[00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:24.540]   Yeah.
[00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:25.540]   I thought it was a no good.
[00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:29.460]   It was like, "Well, you know, come see come saw."
[00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:32.700]   You know, the other thing to consider is that as long as he's on a leave of absence, let's
[00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:38.060]   say it lasts past six months but gets extended, if he doesn't actually step down, a lot is
[00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:39.660]   going to stay in Stasis.
[00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:43.180]   He's going to have to actually leave the company before someone really takes the reins and there's
[00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:46.660]   a chance for a new visionary to step in, I think.
[00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:47.660]   Yeah.
[00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:49.980]   You know, Patrick, you might have swayed me.
[00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:51.380]   It's not the Steve Jobs issue.
[00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:55.900]   It's the, how many times can you, how many times in a row can you hit it out of the park?
[00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:59.740]   Well, you also remember like Steve Jobs, I mean, remember when Steve Jobs got involved
[00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:04.040]   with some weird little company that was doing, you know, rendering software, which became
[00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:09.340]   Pixar, which became, I mean, like Steve just, Steve's had some extraordinary stuff.
[00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:13.980]   I do think that Steve and Pixar, if you read the books and the stories of this, Steve didn't
[00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:16.460]   have much to do with Pixar's success.
[00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:17.460]   Steve bought the company.
[00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:18.460]   You may have had much to do with it.
[00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:19.460]   Yeah, but it didn't think much of it.
[00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:20.500]   It didn't have anything to do with it.
[00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:23.740]   It took off with Toy Story and then he says, "Yeah, I did that."
[00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:27.540]   And took the money and ran, but I don't think anybody thinks that Steve Jobs had much to
[00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:28.740]   do with Pixar's success.
[00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:30.580]   That was more luck than anything else.
[00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:33.460]   It may have been luck, but when you look at the number of people who have bought production
[00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:36.700]   studios of one kind of another in Hollywood, you know what I mean?
[00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:37.700]   True.
[00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:40.620]   He may not have discovered the silver mine, but he sure as heck bought into it at the
[00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:41.620]   right time.
[00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:42.620]   Oh, no.
[00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:43.620]   It could be luck.
[00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:44.620]   It could just be brilliant insight, but you know.
[00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:47.380]   Yeah, you guys are a meditator.
[00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:48.380]   A meditator?
[00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:49.380]   Well, you know, I went to India.
[00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:52.740]   I think there's some mystic thing going on with that guy in some way, and I think that's
[00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:53.740]   how they pick sort of thing happening.
[00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:56.660]   I think that's why he could be better when he comes back.
[00:22:56.660 --> 00:22:58.620]   He's meditating right now.
[00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:02.980]   He's meditating on how can I get these guys?
[00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:05.540]   How can I get these guys off the air?
[00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:06.540]   Get this.
[00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:10.340]   Well, by the way, as long as we're talking Apple, 15,000 applications in the iPhone
[00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:14.980]   app store, 500 million downloads.
[00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:19.940]   There is just no question that yes, another home run out of the park for Apple, this
[00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:25.420]   iPhone and the six month old app store, a huge success.
[00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:29.700]   Yeah, you notice they're not publishing a how many of those Apple app applications have
[00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:33.580]   been downloaded more than five times and be how many of the installed apps have been
[00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:35.020]   or have been uninstalled.
[00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:36.220]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:37.340]   And I but you know what?
[00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:38.340]   That's fine.
[00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:40.580]   I buy apps and uninstall them all the time.
[00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:43.820]   I mean, the fact that there's that variety there.
[00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:51.060]   I mean, that's it's well, I'll tell you at the Colton concert when Colton Rick rolled everybody
[00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:53.260]   about 800 iPhones come out.
[00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:55.540]   That was pretty interesting.
[00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:57.340]   I've said nothing but iPhones.
[00:23:57.340 --> 00:23:59.660]   No doubt it's been insanely successful.
[00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:00.660]   Yeah.
[00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:06.460]   And the app store, you know, as excited as I am about the Palm pre and as excited as
[00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:12.500]   I was about Android and the G1, that app store and the music store and the tie in and the
[00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:18.420]   elegance of the interface and integration is really key.
[00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:19.420]   It's impressive.
[00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:20.420]   It's impressive as heck.
[00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:24.780]   I think you got to know where it comes from and that will determine whether Apple continues
[00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:28.420]   to do well, better or worse, I think is that has always been their key.
[00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:30.340]   They don't get into new businesses.
[00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:33.620]   They come up with elegant ways of executing on businesses.
[00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:34.620]   Right.
[00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:35.620]   Exactly.
[00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:36.940]   My point exactly.
[00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:38.940]   And onward.
[00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:39.940]   Get this.
[00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:45.060]   The security researchers at F secure, a very well known, very respected, good company out
[00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:54.100]   of Finland today said that nearly nine million computers have been infected by the downed
[00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:59.220]   up worm in the last two weeks, six and a half million of them in the last four days.
[00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:02.420]   The downed up downed up worm.
[00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:09.100]   By the way, also known as this is a problem with viruses also known as, um, oh, I can't
[00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:11.860]   for can't find this the AKA.
[00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:12.860]   Oh, yeah.
[00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:13.860]   Oh, right.
[00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:14.860]   Good old con.
[00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:15.860]   Oh, I'm figure.
[00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:17.860]   Why didn't you say that in the first place?
[00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:18.860]   Conficker.
[00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:20.980]   I hardly knew her.
[00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:25.180]   But listen, I heard it nine million.
[00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:26.180]   You don't believe it?
[00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:28.140]   No, no, I'm talking about your gag.
[00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:29.620]   I wasn't saying listen to my gag.
[00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:31.500]   I was saying listen to the statistic.
[00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:32.940]   Yeah, I do believe it.
[00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:34.140]   It's very possible.
[00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:35.860]   Holy cow.
[00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:41.300]   This is the worst they say that they've seen since the days of Melissa and sasser when,
[00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:45.900]   you know, in the wild, those days in Trojan horse, a spam bot thing, isn't it?
[00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:47.460]   Well, yes.
[00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:52.660]   And you know, the reason we haven't seen such infections like this in the past is because
[00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:56.980]   the firewall is now on by default in windows and most people have anti viruses and there's
[00:25:56.980 --> 00:25:58.500]   been some education.
[00:25:58.500 --> 00:25:59.500]   But here's the deal.
[00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:06.340]   This one takes advantage of a hole in Microsoft Windows 2000 XP VISTAs server 2003 and server
[00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:07.340]   2008.
[00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:13.340]   It was fixed with an out of cycle update in late October, but about a third of all PCs
[00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:15.660]   don't bother updating.
[00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:16.660]   So they're completely vulnerable.
[00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:19.620]   You know, as a matter of what you do, you have your firewall turned on.
[00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:20.620]   You have your antivirus.
[00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:21.620]   Doesn't matter.
[00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:22.620]   You're going to get infected.
[00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:24.100]   I'll be right back guys.
[00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:27.340]   I just had a major diaper emergency.
[00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:29.340]   Was that you or Sheamus?
[00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:31.580]   That was that was a firewall problem.
[00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:32.580]   Yeah.
[00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:33.580]   But that was.
[00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:38.860]   You know, you know, I have Patrick on the show.
[00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:42.940]   He's the only Twitter changes diapers during the show.
[00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:45.780]   So how does this how does this get to nine million so fast?
[00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:51.780]   Because we earlier this week, we had the note out that the storm worm was broken and
[00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:56.460]   that there was a quiet period and then this blasted right after that.
[00:26:56.460 --> 00:26:57.460]   It's a real worm though.
[00:26:57.460 --> 00:26:58.460]   Doesn't it just go around?
[00:26:58.460 --> 00:26:59.460]   Yes.
[00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:02.140]   It's poking at the ports and just going in and infecting machines, whether people like
[00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:03.140]   it or not.
[00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:05.020]   So it's the same old thing is what you're saying.
[00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:06.020]   It's the same.
[00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:07.020]   No, it's not the same old thing.
[00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:11.060]   Because some of the typical thing, especially the back end stuff that becomes spam bots,
[00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:14.340]   you have to actually execute something to make them, you know, infect your machine.
[00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:15.340]   You got to do something stupid.
[00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:16.340]   You got to close the box.
[00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:18.060]   You got to say you want to install a flash.
[00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:21.980]   You got this is just this is just basically a real worm which just kind of just goes right
[00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:23.740]   into your machine whether you like it or not.
[00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:25.380]   It takes no action on the users part.
[00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:28.620]   It only takes the inaction of not installing updates.
[00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:29.620]   But this is the problem.
[00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:31.100]   I mean, you know, you've got a mate.
[00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:32.860]   This is a major flaw in Windows.
[00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:36.940]   Now Microsoft in January in the last update, which was on the 13th.
[00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:43.860]   It was this week, put out the Microsoft malicious software removal tool MSRT, which the new
[00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:47.500]   update does remove down a dump conficker.
[00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:51.420]   So we'll get some stats from Microsoft, you know, probably in the next month.
[00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:54.220]   They usually tell us how many they found.
[00:27:54.220 --> 00:27:58.460]   But the problem is it's going to go on machines that are updating and we'll never know how
[00:27:58.460 --> 00:28:00.500]   many machines are out there that have an update.
[00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:01.860]   And that's a real problem with this.
[00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:08.260]   Well, the real problem is PEPCAC, the real problem is people just going and operating
[00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:11.500]   stuff in a way that is unsafe.
[00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:16.380]   And one of those manners in which they operate things unsafely is not updating and patching
[00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:17.380]   their computers.
[00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:21.940]   But in a certain sense, at a certain level of user, we've marketed computers.
[00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:22.940]   We haven't.
[00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:26.460]   But computers have been marketed in a way that says, hey, yeah, you just take this thing
[00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:29.820]   home and plug it in and then you've got the whole worldwide web at your fingertips and
[00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:33.060]   you're going to be doing word processing and publishing videos of your family.
[00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:37.220]   And, you know, and it's marketed as an appliance.
[00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:43.180]   And you don't have the same level of training necessary in a blender or a microwave oven
[00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:44.980]   that you do with a computer.
[00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:49.780]   We're given people who really, I mean, we're given normal people these tools and then saying
[00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:52.060]   you have to be a security expert to use it.
[00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:53.060]   It's ridiculous.
[00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:54.060]   I agree.
[00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:55.060]   We should ban them.
[00:28:55.060 --> 00:28:56.060]   Ban them.
[00:28:56.060 --> 00:28:57.060]   Ban them all.
[00:28:57.060 --> 00:28:58.060]   I think we should license them.
[00:28:58.060 --> 00:28:59.060]   That's what you should do.
[00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:02.300]   And it's just a science to use a computer.
[00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:03.300]   It is just like a driver's license.
[00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:06.740]   I don't know what the solution is, but it's kind of an issue when you have 9 million computers
[00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:10.020]   out there and a giant botnet.
[00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:11.020]   We all suffer from that.
[00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:12.020]   I don't know.
[00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:13.140]   What do you force people to do updates?
[00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:14.380]   How do you solve this?
[00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:16.100]   Microsoft's never been willing to do that.
[00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:18.540]   They have broached the idea though.
[00:29:18.540 --> 00:29:21.340]   In fact, there was some thought that they might do that in Windows 7.
[00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:26.300]   Well, you have to really limit the functionality of a machine to make it more idiot proof.
[00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:28.860]   You're never going to make it entirely idiot proof.
[00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:31.660]   And nobody wants to take that risk because then some other companies are going to say,
[00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:33.620]   "Hey, our machine does more."
[00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:35.060]   We aren't trying to tell you what to do.
[00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:36.060]   We trust you.
[00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:39.260]   Wiser is saying in our chat room, "You just need shock therapy."
[00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:41.620]   This is Apple a little bit.
[00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:44.620]   Didn't update this.
[00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:46.220]   You just kind of what happens anyway.
[00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:47.700]   Yeah, actually they do get the...
[00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:52.420]   No, that's the real problem is that these people, I guarantee you, have the 6 million very
[00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:56.900]   few, probably only a few percentage points actually know they're infected.
[00:29:56.900 --> 00:29:57.900]   That's the whole problem.
[00:29:57.900 --> 00:29:58.900]   You don't know.
[00:29:58.900 --> 00:29:59.900]   You can't tell.
[00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:00.900]   Oh, yeah.
[00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:06.060]   And then there's those devious little malware out there that pretend to be security software
[00:30:06.060 --> 00:30:09.220]   and pop up and say, "We need to check for a virus.
[00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:10.220]   Click OK.
[00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:12.580]   I don't know how I've had a few friends fall for that."
[00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:13.580]   Get this.
[00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:14.580]   Get this one.
[00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:18.620]   So I had a call on the radio show, "Guys a photographer, Joseph Orsillo."
[00:30:18.620 --> 00:30:25.260]   He says, "My site is hosted on iPower," which is a pretty big shared serving hoster.
[00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:29.380]   He says, "When I go to my site or sillofotography.com," it's fine.
[00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:30.940]   Normally you see the site there.
[00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:37.340]   "If you go through a Google or Yahoo search, you will get, instead of my site, you'll get
[00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:40.980]   a warning that says your system is infected with spyware.
[00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:45.180]   It'll take you to a website where it does a faux scan," because I did it on the Mac,
[00:30:45.180 --> 00:30:51.020]   and it stills found all these windows viruses, and says, "You need to download antivirus 2009."
[00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:54.860]   And no matter what you click, it starts to download antivirus 2009.
[00:30:54.860 --> 00:31:00.940]   And E-X-E, which is, of course, actually spyware or virus, is very well known.
[00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:03.340]   A lot of people would be fooled like that, but this is even worse.
[00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:09.980]   This poor guy, you go to his site, and it turns out his site, or probably iPower, a
[00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:15.500]   flaw in iPower is set up, but again, security flaw, allowed somebody to get onto the site,
[00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:21.260]   change an access file, the htaccess file, and anytime a referrer is Google or Yahoo, boom,
[00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:22.260]   you don't go to his site.
[00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:24.100]   You go to their site.
[00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:25.700]   I mean, this is nasty.
[00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:27.340]   That's somebody who kind of knows what they're doing.
[00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:28.340]   I mean...
[00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:29.340]   Oh, yeah.
[00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:32.100]   And apparently, I went out and searched.
[00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:33.100]   This has been going on.
[00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:34.100]   I found it.
[00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:37.500]   This has happened to iPower in July.
[00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:39.500]   So this stuff's been going on for months.
[00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:41.420]   I don't know if it's just iPower.
[00:31:41.420 --> 00:31:46.180]   I suspect what happens is these guys are searching for vulnerabilities on web servers
[00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:49.200]   as soon as they find one, they go...
[00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:54.680]   It could either be that the photographer had a silly password, or that there's something
[00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:57.360]   more likely in my mind, there's something wrong with a server.
[00:31:57.360 --> 00:32:00.840]   There's a flaw, an exploit, no an exploit in the server software.
[00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:01.840]   Yeah.
[00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:04.200]   And these guys just, probably infect thousands of sites at a time.
[00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:05.200]   Sure.
[00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:06.200]   And you're absolutely right, Tom.
[00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:07.200]   I mean, it's tempting.
[00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:08.680]   You look at it, it seems very believable.
[00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:11.000]   No, they had that one.
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.680]   We're about to flash upgrade, and that's really believable.
[00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:14.680]   Absolutely.
[00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:15.680]   Yeah.
[00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:19.160]   If they make it look like some sort of plugin for a browser, it's hard.
[00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:20.160]   It gets hard to tell.
[00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:23.200]   Yeah, and you put the Adobe logo on it, for example.
[00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:26.040]   You don't have to, you don't have to buy it by copyrights.
[00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:29.000]   You might as well put the Microsoft logo up on it.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   It's almost like a sixth sense to know when a pop-up, you're like, "Wait a minute, I didn't
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.200]   do anything that should have triggered that."
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:38.280]   And you have to have a lot of experience with a computer to do it.
[00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:41.840]   And this is, again, this is the problem, is that a lot of people have computers who
[00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:42.840]   don't...
[00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:45.160]   Why should you have to be a security expert?
[00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:46.560]   But you do.
[00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:47.560]   And they're just...
[00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:48.560]   You're right.
[00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:53.840]   What else your local Walmart requires any kind of level of expertise close to that?
[00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:54.840]   Right.
[00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:58.120]   I mean, the same people buying these who can't program VCRs.
[00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:00.600]   I guess the automobile parts probably.
[00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:05.680]   Apparently, I'm looking at the chatroom as of today, and this guy called me yesterday.
[00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:09.280]   I said, "Immediately call your web hosting company and tell them this."
[00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:12.120]   As of today, it's still doing it.
[00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:16.200]   And I can imagine if this is the tip of the iceberg, it's probably thousands.
[00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:18.680]   Something along Circuit City, closes its stores.
[00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:19.840]   A sad story.
[00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:22.200]   30,000 people laid off.
[00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:26.480]   567 stores closed.
[00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:30.640]   The fate of outstanding warranties, the fire dog repair service, and the Canadian stores
[00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:31.640]   still unknown.
[00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:33.320]   But about those extended warranties.
[00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:34.720]   Yeah, good question.
[00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:37.040]   Don't they usually buy a third party?
[00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:38.040]   I don't know.
[00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:39.920]   I'd say think the whole thing's a scam.
[00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:43.360]   Well, they're gone now.
[00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:47.040]   It was in talks for sales with two "highly interested parties."
[00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:48.040]   Talks broke down.
[00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:52.280]   And that's what it sounds like in Circuit City tonight.
[00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:55.600]   Actually, it's probably going crazy because aren't they having liquidation sales right
[00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:56.600]   now?
[00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:57.600]   Yeah.
[00:33:57.600 --> 00:34:01.560]   Actually, I got reported on my blog somebody had posted, "If I've seen that, when you're
[00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:02.560]   seen that, right?"
[00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:03.560]   Yeah, Brooke.
[00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:06.360]   Yeah, he got, or he was a Brooke, a guy or a girl.
[00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:07.360]   Yeah.
[00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:12.000]   Apparently, to one of these places, and there was one step away from a riot.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   Yeah.
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.720]   I was following Alex from Miami Beach on Twitter.
[00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:19.280]   Alex Shek from the Fairware blog down in South America.
[00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:24.280]   He was in Florida talking about how there's huge, huge lines to get into Circuit City.
[00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:26.720]   And sometimes the discounts were only 10%.
[00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:28.480]   Oh, wow.
[00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:32.840]   According to our chatters, once again, the Circuit City's announced that the third party
[00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:35.840]   company that is ensuring the warranties, extended warranties, is going to continue
[00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:37.440]   to honor those warranties.
[00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:38.440]   Yeah.
[00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:39.760]   Where do you going to take them, though?
[00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:41.080]   Well, oh, that's a good question.
[00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:42.840]   I guess you'd call the third party.
[00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:43.840]   Yeah, what are they going to do?
[00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:47.080]   Yeah, well, there's a place in Chicago still doing repairs.
[00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:50.960]   A few times I bought an extended warranty, you get something in the mail that says, you
[00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:51.960]   know, "Call us."
[00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:52.960]   Don't call them.
[00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:53.960]   Call us.
[00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:54.960]   I don't buy those.
[00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:55.960]   Don't buy them.
[00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:56.960]   There's an...
[00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:59.960]   Who's got the cricket?
[00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:04.240]   There's a cricket in here.
[00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:07.240]   What a cricket in here?
[00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:08.240]   Instant cricket.
[00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:09.240]   So is this?
[00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:10.240]   Now, here's the question.
[00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:11.240]   Yeah, instantcrickets.com.
[00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:12.240]   Very good.
[00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:15.320]   Like that, man.
[00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:17.480]   Here's the question.
[00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:18.880]   Is this going to happen all down the line?
[00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:20.640]   Is it next, best by next?
[00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:22.800]   Or do best by a Walmart survive?
[00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:23.800]   Is this a shame?
[00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:24.800]   In other words, is this...
[00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:25.800]   Best by put these guys out of business.
[00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:26.800]   Well, that's the question.
[00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:31.360]   Is this a shakeout because a better guy came along or is it a shakeout because the internet
[00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:32.600]   is taking all the business?
[00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:34.720]   Well, there's, I think, is a combination of two things.
[00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:38.160]   In other words, we don't have enough room in the retail space anywhere for more than
[00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:40.040]   one or two companies to stay alive.
[00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:42.720]   The fact of the matter is I still like to go buy stuff here and there.
[00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:49.560]   Now, that said, I just got my little cards to get my down converter for analog TV.
[00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:51.560]   Wait a minute.
[00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:52.960]   Wait a minute.
[00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:56.120]   You have an analog TV in rabbit ears?
[00:35:56.120 --> 00:35:57.480]   I don't have rabbit ears.
[00:35:57.480 --> 00:35:59.360]   Free TV.
[00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:02.800]   But I have a couple of old TVs around and I figured I might as well pick up a couple
[00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:03.960]   of these converters just in case.
[00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:05.880]   And I also have some straight up and up monitors.
[00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:06.880]   Did you get the coupon?
[00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:11.640]   I don't have tuners at all and I can't obviously use my VCR for a tuner so I can use one of
[00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:13.960]   these if I want to look at something inside the studio.
[00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:14.960]   That's a tuner?
[00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:15.960]   Those converters?
[00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:16.960]   They're actually a tuner?
[00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:17.960]   Yeah, it's a full-blown tuner.
[00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:20.960]   Oh, I thought I would just convert it somehow and then your TV tuner would take over.
[00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:22.720]   No, no, you just leave your channel.
[00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:28.400]   Yeah, you leave your channel on analog three or whatever, just like you do with a VCR.
[00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:30.760]   And then it's, yeah, some of them are really nifty.
[00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:34.680]   Some of them, they started selling one with a DVR in a two, I think.
[00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:35.880]   Yeah, they're pretty cool.
[00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:44.520]   But anyway, besides the point that I have on analog TV, by the way, these cards are really
[00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:50.440]   weird because they're expensive plastic credit cards embossed with holograms on them and all
[00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:51.440]   you need is the number.
[00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:54.280]   Don't want that number to get faked.
[00:36:54.280 --> 00:37:00.600]   And most of the people are going to buy online because your best tuners are online.
[00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:01.840]   And so you just type in the number.
[00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:05.720]   So what is the point of this dollar and a half card or whatever they cost to punch these
[00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:06.720]   things?
[00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:07.720]   That's got a beautiful hologram.
[00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:09.200]   It's a beautiful card, actually.
[00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:10.600]   Your tax dollars at work.
[00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:11.600]   Save it.
[00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:12.600]   It'll be a...
[00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:13.600]   I believe me.
[00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:16.840]   I hope Patrick comes back before we finish this because he was on Twitter pointing out
[00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:19.840]   that there are a lot of electronics departments left.
[00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:24.200]   You look at Sears, JCPenney, Walmart, Target.
[00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:26.440]   There's a lot of folks out there selling electronics.
[00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:30.900]   It's the specialty stores that are the ones that seem to be going away, the ones that
[00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:32.840]   specialize in just electronics.
[00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:36.320]   And that may be part of the reason Best Buy is weathering this a little better is they
[00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:38.840]   also still do the refrigerators in the washer.
[00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:39.840]   Well, it's good.
[00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:40.840]   I don't know if they do a big volume.
[00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:42.800]   Sure, it's stated a bunch of words.
[00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:43.800]   Anyway.
[00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:49.160]   The point is that I did some research on which of these tuners to get.
[00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:52.720]   And the one I decided on finally was the channel master.
[00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:54.920]   And nobody carries it.
[00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:57.800]   You have to buy it online because Best Buy has...
[00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:02.540]   There's about 25 of these tuners out there that you can get from different companies.
[00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:04.660]   And Best Buy has a model that they had.
[00:38:04.660 --> 00:38:09.220]   I think it was the GE or something, which wasn't even considered one of the better ones.
[00:38:09.220 --> 00:38:11.820]   And you know, Circus City, they weren't listed, but they may have one.
[00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:13.900]   Target has one.
[00:38:13.900 --> 00:38:14.900]   And Walmart has one.
[00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:17.500]   Everybody has one, but there's no selection.
[00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:23.100]   And I think this is the real problem that we're running into, which is the lack of selection.
[00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:28.120]   If you go to Best Buy to buy a DVD player, the selection there is pretty minor.
[00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:30.360]   It's just a few different units.
[00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:34.920]   I mean, it's almost like Costco has got more selection in a lot of these places.
[00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:41.160]   I think there may be something to the idea that the online vendors are really having
[00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:44.740]   an impact mainly because these other guys do a crappy job.
[00:38:44.740 --> 00:38:50.320]   I would say my feeling is that the reason you see technology companies as the first to
[00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:55.200]   go out of business here and record stores is because those, the people who buy that
[00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:58.360]   stuff are the most able and most likely to buy online.
[00:38:58.360 --> 00:38:59.880]   So it's just the canary in the mind.
[00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:03.620]   These are going to go down first, but as more and more people go to Amazon to buy more
[00:39:03.620 --> 00:39:07.040]   and more stuff, it's going to happen to everybody.
[00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:08.040]   All these retailers.
[00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:09.520]   Well, here's the question that comes to mind.
[00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:12.960]   I'm going to try to make it clearer this time.
[00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:15.760]   I'm running at Best Buy.
[00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:19.760]   And I have a selection of 25 of these tuners that I can sell.
[00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:24.520]   Why do I sell a second or third rate tuner when I can sell one of the two or three best
[00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:25.520]   tuners?
[00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:26.800]   Well, there's an interesting psychology.
[00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:28.920]   That's what I'm not getting with these retailers.
[00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:31.840]   In fact, I'll tell you why.
[00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:37.640]   Psychology, have you read predictably irrational, fascinating book, highly recommended?
[00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:38.640]   And that's our segue.
[00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:39.640]   No, it could be audible.com.
[00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:44.080]   It will be in a second, but the point, the effect it was, it was a great audible book,
[00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:46.720]   but the point is he is very interesting.
[00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:47.720]   He talks.
[00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:48.720]   What's the title again?
[00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:50.680]   Predictably irrational.
[00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:55.680]   He talks about a Wall Street Journal offer that he saw where you could buy the paper
[00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:58.800]   loan, the internet loan, or buy both.
[00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:03.160]   And the pricing was such that the paper, the internet loan was a bad deal.
[00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:04.880]   It was like, why would you do that?
[00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:07.640]   Oh, for 25 bucks more, you can get both.
[00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:11.320]   His point was that middle price is not there.
[00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:13.400]   They don't expect to sell it.
[00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:16.720]   It's there to condition you to, oh, 25 bucks more.
[00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:17.960]   What a better deal.
[00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:19.960]   Whether you'll buy up.
[00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:21.840]   You need, I think you need to have choices.
[00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:25.000]   Customers don't want to walk in a store and see just one item.
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:26.960]   They want some items they're not going to buy.
[00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:31.360]   They may never tend to sell these crappier items, but it sets you up for, oh, well, 10
[00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:32.360]   bucks more.
[00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:33.800]   Look how much more you get.
[00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:35.720]   It makes, it's a sales technique.
[00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:40.400]   I think they don't want to carry more than a couple of models because they, they don't
[00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:42.880]   want to have to train their staff in explaining them all.
[00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:46.680]   And they don't want to overwhelm the folks who don't do the research online, who come
[00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:48.680]   in and say, I just need a converter box.
[00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:50.920]   And they walk up, they see two, maybe three.
[00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:54.800]   They can easily come up with some way in their own head of deciding between those three.
[00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:58.920]   But if you put 20 of them up there, they're going to forget about it and leave.
[00:40:58.920 --> 00:40:59.920]   In fact, that's what you had.
[00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:00.920]   One of the things you're saying.
[00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:04.760]   One of the things you're saying is that if you just have one, people resistant.
[00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:05.760]   You have two.
[00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:08.760]   Well, the fact is most of these guys only have one when it comes to this converter.
[00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:10.520]   That's not the point I'm trying to make here.
[00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:15.940]   The point I'm trying to make is that if you're the store, why do the one, or why does the
[00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:19.000]   one, or the three, not the, we'll skip it.
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   20 is no good.
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:22.060]   But let's take the one of the three.
[00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:24.280]   Why do they have to be meaty ochre?
[00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:27.920]   Well, they should have one very good one that they want you to buy.
[00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:32.200]   That's about $20 over a fairly inferior one.
[00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:34.400]   You think there's some foul play going on?
[00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:38.480]   Well, somebody's giving them an extra deal like, you know, you will increase the profit
[00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:40.360]   margin if you carry our crappy one.
[00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:41.360]   Yeah.
[00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:42.360]   But don't carry our competitors.
[00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:44.160]   All the stores and that's why these guys are getting killed.
[00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:46.020]   This, by the way, reminds me of what we have.
[00:41:46.020 --> 00:41:50.100]   We run into the deli that we have up in Washington.
[00:41:50.100 --> 00:41:54.180]   My wife has taken just a drawn a line in the sand.
[00:41:54.180 --> 00:42:00.860]   We're not carrying any sodas that have a high fructose corn syrup in a period.
[00:42:00.860 --> 00:42:03.260]   You want to get a Coca-Cola, you get the Mexican Coke.
[00:42:03.260 --> 00:42:04.260]   That's what we have.
[00:42:04.260 --> 00:42:10.020]   And all the other sodas that we have are essentially made with sugar.
[00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:14.140]   And so, or, you know, and are you plugging your deli's sodas selection?
[00:42:14.140 --> 00:42:15.140]   Yeah.
[00:42:15.140 --> 00:42:17.960]   And I've just, I'm using this as an example because here's what the follow up is.
[00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:21.640]   These distributors come barreling in with, "Oh, why are you doing that?
[00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:24.940]   We'll give you a better deal and you can make a lot more money doing this and a lot
[00:42:24.940 --> 00:42:26.040]   more money doing that."
[00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:29.580]   And you can bring in this crap and you will, so if you sell the crap, you'll be, you'll
[00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:31.580]   double your profits and all this other stuff.
[00:42:31.580 --> 00:42:33.480]   And she just refuses to do it.
[00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:38.020]   But I can see that these distributors, these middlemen, these sales guys that are running,
[00:42:38.020 --> 00:42:45.940]   are taking and ruining retail in this country by pushing garbage when quality is out there.
[00:42:45.940 --> 00:42:47.900]   And so, so people go online and buy the quality.
[00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:50.460]   I'm telling you the one, I want to get the channel master.
[00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:51.460]   I have to order it online.
[00:42:51.460 --> 00:42:56.540]   There's a really good article actually similar to that, but they talked about one more company
[00:42:56.540 --> 00:43:01.060]   who decided not to go into Walmart because Walmart would have pressured their price so
[00:43:01.060 --> 00:43:02.060]   low.
[00:43:02.060 --> 00:43:04.860]   They would have had to change the way they manufacture the lawnmowers.
[00:43:04.860 --> 00:43:07.580]   So they were one of the few people to back out and say, "No, you know what?
[00:43:07.580 --> 00:43:09.900]   We don't want to be sold in Walmart.
[00:43:09.900 --> 00:43:14.020]   We'll continue to go through small operators because we want to continue to make quality
[00:43:14.020 --> 00:43:15.020]   lawnmowers."
[00:43:15.020 --> 00:43:21.620]   And yeah, I mean, it all ties back into you've got to be able to provide a selection that's
[00:43:21.620 --> 00:43:25.500]   good to people, but you've got to be able to make a living.
[00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:29.580]   And so I think that's why you see the crappy selection that you see.
[00:43:29.580 --> 00:43:31.660]   And I think you're right, John.
[00:43:31.660 --> 00:43:36.700]   You don't get away with this anymore because of the option to go online.
[00:43:36.700 --> 00:43:40.740]   So if you're always going to succeed, if you're going to see seed in brick and mortar, you've
[00:43:40.740 --> 00:43:42.020]   got to be superior.
[00:43:42.020 --> 00:43:43.380]   You've got to offer better service.
[00:43:43.380 --> 00:43:46.700]   You know, certain city cut back on their intelligent, you know, as they're in financial
[00:43:46.700 --> 00:43:51.380]   trouble, they hire cheap, you know, minimum wage workers.
[00:43:51.380 --> 00:43:52.380]   You see these cutbacks.
[00:43:52.380 --> 00:43:54.100]   You see Walmart putting pressure on.
[00:43:54.100 --> 00:43:56.620]   That just is the death spiral.
[00:43:56.620 --> 00:43:58.100]   The only way you succeed is brick and mortar.
[00:43:58.100 --> 00:44:00.060]   I look at my bookstore, my local bookstore.
[00:44:00.060 --> 00:44:01.060]   I keep telling them.
[00:44:01.060 --> 00:44:03.860]   You're like, you're not going to succeed because you have a better price.
[00:44:03.860 --> 00:44:06.020]   You're not going to succeed because you have a better selection.
[00:44:06.020 --> 00:44:07.860]   It's all about service.
[00:44:07.860 --> 00:44:08.860]   That's how you're going to succeed.
[00:44:08.860 --> 00:44:11.500]   Well, it's instant gratification for me with electronics.
[00:44:11.500 --> 00:44:16.500]   The only reason I ever buy at a store instead of buying online is because I just decide,
[00:44:16.500 --> 00:44:17.500]   you know what?
[00:44:17.500 --> 00:44:18.500]   Yeah, I'll pay a little more, but I want it right now.
[00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:22.780]   I want to be able to take it home, plug it in tonight, and start using it right away.
[00:44:22.780 --> 00:44:27.300]   And so you've got to cater to that mindset, that convenience and selections part of that
[00:44:27.300 --> 00:44:29.340]   service is part of that.
[00:44:29.340 --> 00:44:33.220]   You've got to say, we're the specialty store where it's okay to come in and walk around
[00:44:33.220 --> 00:44:35.060]   and look at the stuff you're going to buy online.
[00:44:35.060 --> 00:44:38.780]   And then once we get you in the doors, we're going to try to convince you that, hey, you
[00:44:38.780 --> 00:44:39.780]   know what?
[00:44:39.780 --> 00:44:41.380]   There's an advantage to taking it home right now.
[00:44:41.380 --> 00:44:42.380]   Yeah, I like that.
[00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:43.380]   Yeah, instant gratification.
[00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:47.300]   Well, while we're on the subject of this kind of thing and stores closing and opening
[00:44:47.300 --> 00:44:51.500]   and some having good selections and some not, let's take a look at another store, which
[00:44:51.500 --> 00:44:57.020]   is an interesting model, guitar center.
[00:44:57.020 --> 00:45:02.020]   If you go into a guitar center, it has the most amazing selection of products that is
[00:45:02.020 --> 00:45:05.900]   should, I mean, if you want to get like, you know, a mic, I mean, you're going to be looking
[00:45:05.900 --> 00:45:11.060]   at 50 mics, you know, for some podcasting or if you want to get some, you want to buy
[00:45:11.060 --> 00:45:16.820]   a saxophone or a guitar or some strings or some picks or whatever, it's a, they don't,
[00:45:16.820 --> 00:45:19.940]   they take, and all the people working, they're all nuts.
[00:45:19.940 --> 00:45:22.780]   They're all like musicians who love to talk about this stuff.
[00:45:22.780 --> 00:45:25.020]   So they have like, they're the naturally good salesmen.
[00:45:25.020 --> 00:45:28.180]   Now, that may be a sector though that you cannot duplicate online.
[00:45:28.180 --> 00:45:29.180]   Don't you have to?
[00:45:29.180 --> 00:45:32.180]   Well, no, is it musicians friend, the online version of guitar center?
[00:45:32.180 --> 00:45:34.380]   Oh, because I think it is.
[00:45:34.380 --> 00:45:36.300]   Would you buy a guitar online?
[00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:38.900]   I haven't bought a guitar online, but I bought a ton of mics and mixers.
[00:45:38.900 --> 00:45:39.900]   Like I buy online.
[00:45:39.900 --> 00:45:41.580]   I go broadcast, you supply west.
[00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:42.580]   Yeah.
[00:45:42.580 --> 00:45:43.580]   Yeah.
[00:45:43.580 --> 00:45:44.580]   No, that's interesting.
[00:45:44.580 --> 00:45:49.620]   I mean, that would, that would support your argument because it's, it's, they got it.
[00:45:49.620 --> 00:45:54.860]   I'm willing to pay $129 for an $80 mic because I can have it right now.
[00:45:54.860 --> 00:45:58.900]   You know, I don't notice that their prices are over, or so much higher.
[00:45:58.900 --> 00:46:01.580]   I mean, I don't think you'd be paying $129 for an $89 mic.
[00:46:01.580 --> 00:46:02.580]   I think you'd be paying $89.
[00:46:02.580 --> 00:46:06.180]   Well, in California, you also could be paying a significant sales tax.
[00:46:06.180 --> 00:46:11.460]   Yes, well, and is it, maybe I'm missing something and maybe I'm naive here, but isn't there
[00:46:11.460 --> 00:46:16.740]   a way to have your storefront operate as the warehouse for your online sales?
[00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:17.900]   Best Buy does that.
[00:46:17.900 --> 00:46:20.940]   You order online and Best Buy and you could pick it up at a Best Buy this afternoon.
[00:46:20.940 --> 00:46:21.940]   Circuit City did that too.
[00:46:21.940 --> 00:46:23.620]   Circuit City did it before Best Buy.
[00:46:23.620 --> 00:46:24.620]   Oh, interesting.
[00:46:24.620 --> 00:46:25.620]   I think it's a good work for them.
[00:46:25.620 --> 00:46:26.620]   Didn't save them.
[00:46:26.620 --> 00:46:27.620]   That's interesting.
[00:46:27.620 --> 00:46:29.060]   I think Circuit City had some other issues.
[00:46:29.060 --> 00:46:33.020]   You know, this, this business of, you know, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, before I
[00:46:33.020 --> 00:46:35.780]   guess the good guys was another one.
[00:46:35.780 --> 00:46:39.340]   And remember, then if you want to go back far enough, they're in the Bay Area in particular,
[00:46:39.340 --> 00:46:43.940]   they had Pacific stereo and then Matthews, top of the hill daily.
[00:46:43.940 --> 00:46:45.180]   Oh, yeah.
[00:46:45.180 --> 00:46:47.580]   And these guys were always set up.
[00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:50.660]   I mean, that's, Matthews was the worst case scenario.
[00:46:50.660 --> 00:46:57.140]   This was a hard sell operation that had car salesmen, essentially in there.
[00:46:57.140 --> 00:47:00.020]   We, we, we, what do we have to do to get you to take home these speakers right now?
[00:47:00.020 --> 00:47:01.180]   What do we have to do for you?
[00:47:01.180 --> 00:47:04.300]   And well, let me go talk to my manager and I'll get you, we'll get you a price, a better
[00:47:04.300 --> 00:47:05.300]   price than this.
[00:47:05.300 --> 00:47:08.300]   Do you remember Tom Campbell, Matthews, top of the hill daily city were blowing it out
[00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:09.660]   for the bare walls.
[00:47:09.660 --> 00:47:10.660]   Right.
[00:47:10.660 --> 00:47:15.100]   And so, and then the other one was, you know, I remember tipped in appliances in St. Louis.
[00:47:15.100 --> 00:47:16.900]   These are the same kinds of things.
[00:47:16.900 --> 00:47:22.260]   And anyway, Pacific stereo, which was another chain that went out of business completely,
[00:47:22.260 --> 00:47:26.300]   used to do pull some weird stunts, not in terms of hard sell, but in terms of like selling,
[00:47:26.300 --> 00:47:29.540]   you know, crappy or, you know, branded products.
[00:47:29.540 --> 00:47:32.260]   And then along came the good guys in Circuit City.
[00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:34.500]   And these guys are supposed to clean up everybody's act.
[00:47:34.500 --> 00:47:38.340]   But my experience at Circuit City, the good guys, I never, you know, I went in and out
[00:47:38.340 --> 00:47:42.380]   a couple of times and it was always, I didn't like either one of these stores and I particularly
[00:47:42.380 --> 00:47:43.380]   didn't like Circuit City.
[00:47:43.380 --> 00:47:44.740]   I always thought it was dingy.
[00:47:44.740 --> 00:47:45.740]   Yeah.
[00:47:45.740 --> 00:47:49.340]   And, and, and they're supposedly giving you full service, but not really.
[00:47:49.340 --> 00:47:56.140]   I always preferred to go to a place that didn't have the salespeople where you could just walk
[00:47:56.140 --> 00:47:58.380]   up, grab something off the shelf and go up front and buy it.
[00:47:58.380 --> 00:48:00.260]   Well, that's the whole convenience factor I'm talking about.
[00:48:00.260 --> 00:48:04.100]   When you have to wait on a salesperson and well, let's check and see if this model's
[00:48:04.100 --> 00:48:05.460]   in stock.
[00:48:05.460 --> 00:48:08.460]   That's ridiculous.
[00:48:08.460 --> 00:48:10.260]   Listen to this.
[00:48:10.260 --> 00:48:13.020]   It's going to happen any minute now.
[00:48:13.020 --> 00:48:14.020]   What is it?
[00:48:14.020 --> 00:48:18.740]   Matthews, can you get a fully assembled 18 speed, not micro touring by concluded with hundreds
[00:48:18.740 --> 00:48:20.420]   of audio video items?
[00:48:20.420 --> 00:48:22.060]   Get a Sony stereo receiver.
[00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:23.060]   Just get a bike.
[00:48:23.060 --> 00:48:24.060]   Remember that?
[00:48:24.060 --> 00:48:25.060]   Get a fissure.
[00:48:25.060 --> 00:48:26.460]   Big screen card.
[00:48:26.460 --> 00:48:31.540]   Like I want a bike because I'm buying a TV, especially a Fisher, big screen, 40 inch color
[00:48:31.540 --> 00:48:32.540]   TV, $1,500.
[00:48:32.540 --> 00:48:36.180]   I'm in worse than worse.
[00:48:36.180 --> 00:48:37.180]   The days.
[00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:39.460]   The days coming up in just a bit.
[00:48:39.460 --> 00:48:44.300]   It's the end of the world as we know at Google with layoffs and killing products and a British
[00:48:44.300 --> 00:48:51.180]   porn sensor filters 13 years of net history, right disappears right off the face of the
[00:48:51.180 --> 00:48:52.180]   earth.
[00:48:52.180 --> 00:48:55.580]   But first I want to tell you about my good friends at audible.com, talk to the Hill
[00:48:55.580 --> 00:48:58.340]   Daily City where you get a bike with every book.
[00:48:58.340 --> 00:49:00.180]   No, you don't.
[00:49:00.180 --> 00:49:02.300]   Audible.com/twit2.
[00:49:02.300 --> 00:49:03.300]   That's our offer this week.
[00:49:03.300 --> 00:49:05.100]   We're giving you this special platinum.
[00:49:05.100 --> 00:49:06.100]   You go there.
[00:49:06.100 --> 00:49:07.100]   You sign up for your platinum deal.
[00:49:07.100 --> 00:49:08.100]   That's two books a month.
[00:49:08.100 --> 00:49:09.300]   You get two credits.
[00:49:09.300 --> 00:49:12.980]   So the first one I'm going to say is go to get predictably irrational.
[00:49:12.980 --> 00:49:15.100]   This is a great book.
[00:49:15.100 --> 00:49:17.380]   Dan Ariele writes it.
[00:49:17.380 --> 00:49:23.780]   It is an analysis of our economic behavior, the hidden forces, the hidden forces that
[00:49:23.780 --> 00:49:25.940]   shape our decisions.
[00:49:25.940 --> 00:49:29.820]   Why do our headaches persist after taking one cent aspirin but disappear when we take
[00:49:29.820 --> 00:49:33.460]   a 50 cent aspirin for instance?
[00:49:33.460 --> 00:49:36.260]   Why does the that was that this is the one where that incredible.
[00:49:36.260 --> 00:49:37.260]   50 times better.
[00:49:37.260 --> 00:49:38.260]   50 times better.
[00:49:38.260 --> 00:49:39.260]   That's right.
[00:49:39.260 --> 00:49:43.380]   I'm going to ask you a Wall Street Journal example of really, and this is an eye opener.
[00:49:43.380 --> 00:49:47.700]   If you read freakinomics, this is in the same kind of spirit of inquiry, of using really
[00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:54.220]   rational analysis, economic metrics and so forth to really figure out why our behavior
[00:49:54.220 --> 00:49:56.860]   is the way it is.
[00:49:56.860 --> 00:49:59.500]   By the way, since you get two books, I'm going to recommend both.
[00:49:59.500 --> 00:50:03.140]   Predictably irrational, the hidden forces that shape our decisions by Dan Ariele and
[00:50:03.140 --> 00:50:07.060]   if you've not read freakinomics, if you guys read freakinomics?
[00:50:07.060 --> 00:50:08.060]   I have not.
[00:50:08.060 --> 00:50:09.060]   Oh, come on.
[00:50:09.060 --> 00:50:10.060]   That's right.
[00:50:10.060 --> 00:50:11.060]   Yeah.
[00:50:11.060 --> 00:50:17.620]   You know, they have a column in the New York Times soon to be defunct New York Times.
[00:50:17.620 --> 00:50:21.780]   But the whole idea is they use econometrics to really understand human behavior.
[00:50:21.780 --> 00:50:24.020]   That's Steven Levitt and Steven Dubner.
[00:50:24.020 --> 00:50:25.020]   Two great books.
[00:50:25.020 --> 00:50:29.780]   If you want to understand why we act the way we do, economic man behaves the way he
[00:50:29.780 --> 00:50:35.060]   and she does, he or she does, freakinomics by Steven Levitt unabridged.
[00:50:35.060 --> 00:50:36.860]   That's credit number one.
[00:50:36.860 --> 00:50:40.740]   Credit number two, predictably irrational by Dan Ariele.
[00:50:40.740 --> 00:50:45.700]   You get two credits when you go to audible.com/twit2.

[00:50:49.620 --> 00:50:53.100]   But I know you're going to want to 51,000 titles.
[00:50:53.100 --> 00:50:57.380]   The best audio books, Tom, for Sordin Laser, you really, you know, audio is great because
[00:50:57.380 --> 00:50:59.820]   you can listen to the book and it doesn't take up time.
[00:50:59.820 --> 00:51:04.020]   You listen when you're driving or in the gym and bar whatever you are.
[00:51:04.020 --> 00:51:05.020]   I love them.
[00:51:05.020 --> 00:51:08.620]   We've had a few people say they're going to do an audio version of the David Eddings book
[00:51:08.620 --> 00:51:09.620]   that we're reading now.
[00:51:09.620 --> 00:51:10.620]   Oh, good.
[00:51:10.620 --> 00:51:12.140]   You know, that's one thing Audible's doing.
[00:51:12.140 --> 00:51:13.140]   I'm really proud of them.
[00:51:13.140 --> 00:51:17.180]   You know, a lot of sci-fi books are not recorded because, you know, the publishers aren't big
[00:51:17.180 --> 00:51:18.180]   bucks publishers.
[00:51:18.180 --> 00:51:20.620]   A lot of the books, you know, don't have huge audiences.
[00:51:20.620 --> 00:51:22.460]   It's not like the big random houses of the world.
[00:51:22.460 --> 00:51:27.980]   So Audible has taken it on themselves to record many of the great classics of science fiction,
[00:51:27.980 --> 00:51:29.780]   many thousands of titles now in there.
[00:51:29.780 --> 00:51:34.380]   They've built nine studios in their headquarters and they're recording like crazy.
[00:51:34.380 --> 00:51:35.380]   Okay.
[00:51:35.380 --> 00:51:39.100]   So there are a lot of audible exclusives in sci-fi and a lot of other areas, 51,000 titles.
[00:51:39.100 --> 00:51:41.220]   You know, you're sure to find something you're interested in.
[00:51:41.220 --> 00:51:46.980]   I download two books a month and I still want more audible.com/twit2.
[00:51:46.980 --> 00:51:50.980]   We thank them so much for their support of this week in tech.
[00:51:50.980 --> 00:51:56.620]   So this is why I love filters so much in Great Britain.
[00:51:56.620 --> 00:52:02.980]   I guess they're, you know, like Australia, I don't understand this idea in the first place.
[00:52:02.980 --> 00:52:09.100]   They created a porn, a child porn blacklist and they're encouraging internet service providers
[00:52:09.100 --> 00:52:10.100]   to use it.
[00:52:10.100 --> 00:52:16.900]   Many are among other things, this child porn blacklist blocks, the internet archives way
[00:52:16.900 --> 00:52:17.740]   back machine.
[00:52:17.740 --> 00:52:21.860]   I don't know where their child porn is on there.
[00:52:21.860 --> 00:52:24.100]   And well, it's the way back machine.
[00:52:24.100 --> 00:52:25.100]   It did die.
[00:52:25.100 --> 00:52:26.100]   It archives everything.
[00:52:26.100 --> 00:52:27.100]   Oh, maybe there is.
[00:52:27.100 --> 00:52:28.620]   It's probably got that scorpions cover.
[00:52:28.620 --> 00:52:31.140]   They were so worried about earlier somewhere in there.
[00:52:31.140 --> 00:52:32.140]   Yeah, you're probably right.
[00:52:32.140 --> 00:52:33.140]   I don't know.
[00:52:33.140 --> 00:52:36.820]   I don't think they archive everything because there's all kinds of stuff missing from the
[00:52:36.820 --> 00:52:37.820]   label.
[00:52:37.820 --> 00:52:38.820]   They do.
[00:52:38.820 --> 00:52:39.820]   This is, I found out about this.
[00:52:39.820 --> 00:52:41.500]   You know, it's Brister Cale's project, the internet archive.
[00:52:41.500 --> 00:52:42.500]   They do.
[00:52:42.500 --> 00:52:43.500]   They try to.
[00:52:43.500 --> 00:52:48.740]   They do terabytes a day, but they don't put it all online for various reasons.
[00:52:48.740 --> 00:52:54.220]   So while they are attempting to archive everything and they have sites in Alexandria, Egypt,
[00:52:54.220 --> 00:52:56.620]   at the library there is one of their sites.
[00:52:56.620 --> 00:52:59.940]   They're archiving this stuff all the time, but only some of it makes it to the way back
[00:52:59.940 --> 00:53:00.940]   machine.
[00:53:00.940 --> 00:53:02.620]   Yeah, because they don't have all my old pages.
[00:53:02.620 --> 00:53:06.380]   I had stuff that used to be available in the way back machine that is no longer.
[00:53:06.380 --> 00:53:07.380]   Oh, interesting.
[00:53:07.380 --> 00:53:10.660]   Because it was a subdirectory of an ISP, you know, one of those kind of home pages.
[00:53:10.660 --> 00:53:11.660]   Right.
[00:53:11.660 --> 00:53:15.100]   And for a while it would show up and then they, I think they said, you know, that level down.
[00:53:15.100 --> 00:53:16.100]   Forget it.
[00:53:16.100 --> 00:53:17.900]   They have cRL.com/tilde-loport.
[00:53:17.900 --> 00:53:18.900]   Wow.
[00:53:18.900 --> 00:53:23.100]   They don't have concentric.net/tilde-ace-detect anymore.
[00:53:23.100 --> 00:53:25.060]   Remember that?
[00:53:25.060 --> 00:53:26.060]   Everything was/tilde.
[00:53:26.060 --> 00:53:27.060]   Yeah.
[00:53:27.060 --> 00:53:28.740]   You were ace-detect even back then.
[00:53:28.740 --> 00:53:29.740]   Oh, yeah.
[00:53:29.740 --> 00:53:32.260]   It started on concentric network.
[00:53:32.260 --> 00:53:33.260]   And they all A-C-E-D-T-E-C-T.
[00:53:33.260 --> 00:53:35.260]   Oh, I get it.
[00:53:35.260 --> 00:53:36.260]   They only gave you eight letters.
[00:53:36.260 --> 00:53:37.260]   Yeah.
[00:53:37.260 --> 00:53:40.020]   Listen to the end of East Meets West if you want to find out the story behind that name.
[00:53:40.020 --> 00:53:43.620]   And last, when I was on Buzz Out Loud this weekend, you gave out, or this week you gave
[00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:44.620]   out a website.
[00:53:44.620 --> 00:53:47.580]   What was the name of that website?
[00:53:47.580 --> 00:53:49.140]   It says, is it Subbrilliant?
[00:53:49.140 --> 00:53:50.780]   Subbrilliant.com.
[00:53:50.780 --> 00:53:52.700]   That your old website that you designed?
[00:53:52.700 --> 00:53:53.700]   Oh, yeah.
[00:53:53.700 --> 00:53:56.180]   Subbrilliant.com/bad.html.
[00:53:56.180 --> 00:53:59.180]   This is Tom Merritt's old website.
[00:53:59.180 --> 00:54:00.180]   Really lovely.
[00:54:00.180 --> 00:54:01.180]   No.
[00:54:01.180 --> 00:54:04.180]   That's my blog.
[00:54:04.180 --> 00:54:07.180]   The twirling pumpkins.
[00:54:07.180 --> 00:54:09.860]   The cats in the igloo.
[00:54:09.860 --> 00:54:12.820]   The rotating tele-friend about this site, but my favorite, of course.
[00:54:12.820 --> 00:54:14.060]   And it's a classic.
[00:54:14.060 --> 00:54:17.180]   The mailbox with a letter going in.
[00:54:17.180 --> 00:54:21.060]   Mail me and tell me how much you like my site.
[00:54:21.060 --> 00:54:24.340]   That's the kind of stuff you find on the internet way back machine.
[00:54:24.340 --> 00:54:27.620]   That one probably is on the way back machine, but it's also just on the regular internet.
[00:54:27.620 --> 00:54:28.620]   Yeah.
[00:54:28.620 --> 00:54:31.780]   And we should say we did that for call for help for the web workshop, right?
[00:54:31.780 --> 00:54:32.780]   Yeah.
[00:54:32.780 --> 00:54:35.780]   I think the date of the episode still listed on that page somewhere.
[00:54:35.780 --> 00:54:38.540]   Well, you have 16,000 visitors since June 29th, 2000.
[00:54:38.540 --> 00:54:43.540]   So it's up 2000 since Wednesday, I think.
[00:54:43.540 --> 00:54:45.540]   See that's the power of Buzz Out Loud.
[00:54:45.540 --> 00:54:48.700]   Oh, it's going to skyrocket now.
[00:54:48.700 --> 00:54:52.100]   A couple of weeks ago when Jason Calicanis was on the show, he says, "You know we've hit
[00:54:52.100 --> 00:54:59.540]   bottom on the Great Depression of 2009 when Google starts firing people."
[00:54:59.540 --> 00:55:01.900]   Well Google is firing people.
[00:55:01.900 --> 00:55:02.900]   These aren't contractors.
[00:55:02.900 --> 00:55:05.380]   These are actual wage slaves at Google.
[00:55:05.380 --> 00:55:09.020]   Only a hundred, mostly in HR.
[00:55:09.020 --> 00:55:11.740]   Well, that's not, that's a benefit.
[00:55:11.740 --> 00:55:19.780]   I was going to say, this like Shakespeare, first we kill the lawyers, first we fire HR.
[00:55:19.780 --> 00:55:23.140]   Then they've also killed a few things, which probably they should have killed a long time
[00:55:23.140 --> 00:55:27.100]   ago, like Dodgeball, which was essentially dead.
[00:55:27.100 --> 00:55:31.140]   That was their version of location service, right?
[00:55:31.140 --> 00:55:34.580]   It was kind of a bright kite thing way back before even Google bought it.
[00:55:34.580 --> 00:55:35.580]   Yeah.
[00:55:35.580 --> 00:55:37.140]   And they just kind of let it, you know.
[00:55:37.140 --> 00:55:42.220]   Well, they also killed the catalog search, which nobody used, but I did.
[00:55:42.220 --> 00:55:44.620]   Unfortunately, they didn't really maintain it very well.
[00:55:44.620 --> 00:55:47.500]   But when they first put it up, I thought it was one of the more fascinating things on
[00:55:47.500 --> 00:55:48.500]   the internet.
[00:55:48.500 --> 00:55:55.500]   I don't know if you're familiar with it, but it essentially was a scan, a full text scan
[00:55:55.500 --> 00:56:00.340]   with pictures from each page of every catalog in the country, those things that typically
[00:56:00.340 --> 00:56:04.420]   your wife gets from LL Bean and you know.
[00:56:04.420 --> 00:56:05.660]   Oh, I loved that.
[00:56:05.660 --> 00:56:06.660]   They killed that?
[00:56:06.660 --> 00:56:07.660]   Yes.
[00:56:07.660 --> 00:56:08.660]   I hadn't used it in years though.
[00:56:08.660 --> 00:56:09.980]   Yes, see, this is the problem.
[00:56:09.980 --> 00:56:15.620]   But the thing is my experience, they even had the K&L Wine Store newsletter.
[00:56:15.620 --> 00:56:18.340]   And so instead of getting, you could just actually look at the scan of it.
[00:56:18.340 --> 00:56:20.900]   They had a full scan and you could, but it was weird.
[00:56:20.900 --> 00:56:24.140]   You could cut and paste from it and search on it and do all kinds of work.
[00:56:24.140 --> 00:56:27.660]   Could you click to buy from it?
[00:56:27.660 --> 00:56:28.660]   Probably not.
[00:56:28.660 --> 00:56:29.660]   I don't remember.
[00:56:29.660 --> 00:56:30.660]   I remember you could not.
[00:56:30.660 --> 00:56:33.020]   I remember when they launched that, I thought that was so cool.
[00:56:33.020 --> 00:56:34.220]   But you know, do they really need it?
[00:56:34.220 --> 00:56:35.860]   You can just go to the LL Bean site now.
[00:56:35.860 --> 00:56:37.380]   No, it's different than the catalog.
[00:56:37.380 --> 00:56:39.460]   The catalog's presented, you know, it's a catalog issue.
[00:56:39.460 --> 00:56:40.460]   Right.
[00:56:40.460 --> 00:56:41.460]   There was a scan it in.
[00:56:41.460 --> 00:56:42.460]   Yeah.
[00:56:42.460 --> 00:56:44.420]   I wonder what the person who is scanning all those in is doing now.
[00:56:44.420 --> 00:56:47.220]   They say it was a demo of their OCR technology.
[00:56:47.220 --> 00:56:48.580]   Yeah, I guess.
[00:56:48.580 --> 00:56:52.260]   So it was all about showing, oh, look how, you know, we could take this page and make
[00:56:52.260 --> 00:56:55.460]   it live just by using our OCR.
[00:56:55.460 --> 00:57:00.900]   Now Google says that they're also hiring just as much as they're letting go.
[00:57:00.900 --> 00:57:04.820]   I think in an attempt to kind of stave off any panic around their stock.
[00:57:04.820 --> 00:57:05.820]   Okay.
[00:57:05.820 --> 00:57:10.220]   But it could be a reasonable explanation to say, look, we're not going to be growing as
[00:57:10.220 --> 00:57:11.220]   fast.
[00:57:11.220 --> 00:57:13.620]   We're cutting back on HR because we're not going to be doing as much recruiting.
[00:57:13.620 --> 00:57:15.180]   It doesn't mean we're not hiring at all.
[00:57:15.180 --> 00:57:16.180]   Right.
[00:57:16.180 --> 00:57:18.220]   And people get fired from companies all the time.
[00:57:18.220 --> 00:57:21.380]   You always are if it's that bit with how many tens of thousands of employees do they
[00:57:21.380 --> 00:57:22.380]   have?
[00:57:22.380 --> 00:57:26.780]   If that big, there's always, you know, some movement, I would think.
[00:57:26.780 --> 00:57:27.780]   Okay.
[00:57:27.780 --> 00:57:28.780]   A hundred people, no big deal.
[00:57:28.780 --> 00:57:32.220]   When we hear thousands, that's when you start to say, okay, something's going on.
[00:57:32.220 --> 00:57:34.900]   They also killed Jaiku, which.
[00:57:34.900 --> 00:57:39.060]   Well, now the Jaiku person says, no, we're not killed.
[00:57:39.060 --> 00:57:40.980]   We're just reforming because they're open source.
[00:57:40.980 --> 00:57:41.980]   They're open source.
[00:57:41.980 --> 00:57:42.980]   They're open source.
[00:57:42.980 --> 00:57:43.980]   They're open source.
[00:57:43.980 --> 00:57:44.980]   They're open source.

[00:57:45.980 --> 00:57:46.980]   They're open source.
[00:57:46.980 --> 00:57:47.980]   They're open source.
[00:57:47.980 --> 00:57:48.980]   They're open source.
[00:57:48.980 --> 00:57:49.980]   They're open source.
[00:57:49.980 --> 00:57:50.980]   They're open source.
[00:57:50.980 --> 00:57:51.980]   They're open source.
[00:57:51.980 --> 00:57:52.980]   They're open source.
[00:57:52.980 --> 00:57:53.980]   They're open source.
[00:57:53.980 --> 00:57:54.980]   They're open source.
[00:57:54.980 --> 00:57:55.980]   They're open source.
[00:57:55.980 --> 00:57:56.980]   They're open source.
[00:57:56.980 --> 00:57:57.980]   They're open source.
[00:57:57.980 --> 00:57:58.980]   They're open source.

[00:58:11.980 --> 00:58:12.980]   They're open source.
[00:58:12.980 --> 00:58:13.980]   They're open source.
[00:58:13.980 --> 00:58:14.980]   They're open source.
[00:58:14.980 --> 00:58:15.980]   They're open source.
[00:58:15.980 --> 00:58:16.980]   They're open source.
[00:58:16.980 --> 00:58:17.980]   They're open source.

[01:14:09.980 --> 01:14:10.980]   They're mind-duraling.
[01:14:10.980 --> 01:14:11.980]   Yeah.
[01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:12.980]   Right.
[01:14:12.980 --> 01:14:13.980]   That probably took them a while.
[01:14:13.980 --> 01:14:14.980]   Yeah, I would think so.
[01:14:14.980 --> 01:14:15.980]   But Bert's still taking.
[01:14:15.980 --> 01:14:19.980]   I mean, it's four years as, you know, Bert's only done one.
[01:14:19.980 --> 01:14:21.580]   He did them with light brights.
[01:14:21.580 --> 01:14:23.980]   He has all those other little studies, but he has every.
[01:14:23.980 --> 01:14:25.980]   I'm telling you, I guess you've got to go to this.
[01:14:25.980 --> 01:14:26.980]   Oh, I'm dying to see it.
[01:14:26.980 --> 01:14:27.980]   I love Bert anyway.
[01:14:27.980 --> 01:14:32.220]   He also has his old stuff up where he used to do, you know, the stuff that he did in 1988
[01:14:32.220 --> 01:14:34.580]   when we had no tools.
[01:14:34.580 --> 01:14:35.580]   It's pretty funny.
[01:14:35.580 --> 01:14:38.580]   He was, you know, he like was the beta tester for the first Photoshop.
[01:14:38.580 --> 01:14:39.580]   He was very early on.
[01:14:39.580 --> 01:14:44.080]   He wrote one of the very first books, Photoshop channel chops, which by the way, I have, Bert
[01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:45.940]   very kindly gave me an autographed copy.
[01:14:45.940 --> 01:14:49.620]   That is a, that is precious because it's one of the first Photoshop books.
[01:14:49.620 --> 01:14:51.940]   Yeah, he was right there at the beginning.
[01:14:51.940 --> 01:14:53.460]   It's kind of neat.
[01:14:53.460 --> 01:14:54.460]   Neat guy, Bert Munn.
[01:14:54.460 --> 01:14:55.460]   Right.
[01:14:55.460 --> 01:14:59.380]   Well, I guess there's no reason to hang around waiting for Patrick to get back.
[01:14:59.380 --> 01:15:01.860]   He's probably in the shower by now.
[01:15:01.860 --> 01:15:02.860]   He sent an email.
[01:15:02.860 --> 01:15:03.860]   He apologizes.
[01:15:03.860 --> 01:15:06.780]   I can't tell you how many times.
[01:15:06.780 --> 01:15:08.020]   It's almost every time.
[01:15:08.020 --> 01:15:11.380]   It's like a, it's like a fractal.
[01:15:11.380 --> 01:15:15.260]   The Mandelbrad said it's the Mandelbrad said Benoit, Mendelbrad.
[01:15:15.260 --> 01:15:17.180]   Just the same thing over and over.
[01:15:17.180 --> 01:15:18.180]   Over and over.
[01:15:18.180 --> 01:15:19.780]   The coin called Z on a complex plane.
[01:15:19.780 --> 01:15:20.780]   You know it.
[01:15:20.780 --> 01:15:23.460]   But Z one B Z squared plus you know it.
[01:15:23.460 --> 01:15:24.460]   Yeah.
[01:15:24.460 --> 01:15:25.460]   I know the song.
[01:15:25.460 --> 01:15:28.220]   I was going to say there's the saying it saying it.
[01:15:28.220 --> 01:15:29.220]   Oh, he don't hear me.
[01:15:29.220 --> 01:15:30.220]   It's a song.
[01:15:30.220 --> 01:15:31.220]   Yeah.
[01:15:31.220 --> 01:15:32.460]   Just go download it in Jonathan Colton dot com song.
[01:15:32.460 --> 01:15:34.420]   Yeah, everybody should go out and buy every bit of.
[01:15:34.420 --> 01:15:35.420]   I love that song.
[01:15:35.420 --> 01:15:36.900]   He sang that last night.
[01:15:36.900 --> 01:15:38.180]   And he has a T shirt.
[01:15:38.180 --> 01:15:39.540]   I don't know if this succeeds.
[01:15:39.540 --> 01:15:46.340]   It's a Mandelbrad with the dark side of the moon rainbow kind of over it.
[01:15:46.340 --> 01:15:47.340]   I don't know.
[01:15:47.340 --> 01:15:49.420]   I don't know if that kind succeeds.
[01:15:49.420 --> 01:15:52.340]   Hey dudes, we're out of here.
[01:15:52.340 --> 01:15:53.340]   Thank you so much.
[01:15:53.340 --> 01:15:55.900]   Tom Merritt is a buzz out loud B O L dot C net dot com.
[01:15:55.900 --> 01:15:57.340]   Watch it live.
[01:15:57.340 --> 01:16:00.500]   Watch B O L dot is it dot com dot com?
[01:16:00.500 --> 01:16:01.500]   Yes.
[01:16:01.500 --> 01:16:03.340]   And that's around 10 30 a Pacific every morning.
[01:16:03.340 --> 01:16:04.340]   Yep.
[01:16:04.340 --> 01:16:05.340]   Not this Monday.
[01:16:05.340 --> 01:16:08.540]   I've been getting this before Monday because Martin Luther King Day, but you get Martin
[01:16:08.540 --> 01:16:09.540]   Luther King Day off.
[01:16:09.540 --> 01:16:10.540]   We do.
[01:16:10.540 --> 01:16:12.780]   It's kind of one of those every other year things this year we get it.
[01:16:12.780 --> 01:16:16.700]   We debated it at the Twit cottage and I decided not to give the employees a day off.
[01:16:16.700 --> 01:16:18.500]   They must be here tomorrow.
[01:16:18.500 --> 01:16:19.500]   You hear that?
[01:16:19.500 --> 01:16:21.580]   They're calling it sick.
[01:16:21.580 --> 01:16:22.580]   You hear that?
[01:16:22.580 --> 01:16:24.140]   I'll give you a Tuesday off.
[01:16:24.140 --> 01:16:25.140]   This is the inauguration.
[01:16:25.140 --> 01:16:26.860]   Yeah, we had to work on Tuesday.
[01:16:26.860 --> 01:16:28.060]   So I'm giving them Tuesday off.
[01:16:28.060 --> 01:16:31.020]   They can watch the inauguration because that's historic.
[01:16:31.020 --> 01:16:32.020]   That's historic.
[01:16:32.020 --> 01:16:33.020]   Yes.
[01:16:33.020 --> 01:16:34.860]   That's for the Obama inauguration.
[01:16:34.860 --> 01:16:37.020]   It's called Obama inaugural.
[01:16:37.020 --> 01:16:42.380]   There's also inauguration underscore DC, which is if you're in Washington for Tuesday, you're
[01:16:42.380 --> 01:16:43.380]   going to need some information.
[01:16:43.380 --> 01:16:44.860]   You can follow it on Twitter.
[01:16:44.860 --> 01:16:47.260]   They'll tell you where the closings are, what's going on.
[01:16:47.260 --> 01:16:51.820]   Twitter is turning out to be a great tool for that kind of breaking news, I think, because
[01:16:51.820 --> 01:16:55.620]   it comes through your cell phone and you know, you can keep an eye on stuff.
[01:16:55.620 --> 01:16:56.780]   Also there are many broadcasts.
[01:16:56.780 --> 01:17:00.140]   Microsoft is going to be doing a silver light broadcast.
[01:17:00.140 --> 01:17:04.180]   There's some upset about that because silver light is Windows and Mac only.
[01:17:04.180 --> 01:17:05.180]   It doesn't work on Linux.
[01:17:05.180 --> 01:17:06.740]   It doesn't work on PowerPC Mac.
[01:17:06.740 --> 01:17:08.700]   Lots of other broadcast streams.
[01:17:08.700 --> 01:17:09.700]   Everybody's doing it.
[01:17:09.700 --> 01:17:11.700]   Hulu is going to have Fox's stream.
[01:17:11.700 --> 01:17:15.180]   CBS's stream is going to be unjuiced.
[01:17:15.180 --> 01:17:17.940]   So there's plenty of ways to watch it that are not television.
[01:17:17.940 --> 01:17:21.660]   Why wouldn't you just watch it on your big HD TV at home?
[01:17:21.660 --> 01:17:22.660]   I am.
[01:17:22.660 --> 01:17:23.660]   I'm going to be in the studio watching it.
[01:17:23.660 --> 01:17:24.660]   You've got a big HD TV at home.
[01:17:24.660 --> 01:17:25.660]   That is definitely the way to watch it.
[01:17:25.660 --> 01:17:26.660]   Yeah, I'm excited.
[01:17:26.660 --> 01:17:27.660]   I'm going to be crying.
[01:17:27.660 --> 01:17:28.660]   I'm going to.
[01:17:28.660 --> 01:17:29.660]   You're going to be crying?
[01:17:29.660 --> 01:17:31.660]   Is he going to say that?
[01:17:31.660 --> 01:17:32.660]   Yeah.
[01:17:32.660 --> 01:17:34.660]   Why did you drop it on your foot?
[01:17:34.660 --> 01:17:35.660]   I'm sorry.
[01:17:35.660 --> 01:17:36.660]   It's sweet.
[01:17:36.660 --> 01:17:39.740]   I think this is a sivital moment.
[01:17:39.740 --> 01:17:40.740]   Yeah.
[01:17:40.740 --> 01:17:41.740]   I'm upset.
[01:17:41.740 --> 01:17:42.740]   This should never have happened.
[01:17:42.740 --> 01:17:43.740]   McCain, no.
[01:17:43.740 --> 01:17:45.980]   This is a pivotal moment in our history.
[01:17:45.980 --> 01:17:48.940]   An African American is being inaugurated as president of the United States.
[01:17:48.940 --> 01:17:49.940]   I don't think there's a.
[01:17:49.940 --> 01:17:52.020]   It doesn't give you a.
[01:17:52.020 --> 01:17:53.580]   It doesn't mean you should be crying.
[01:17:53.580 --> 01:17:54.580]   You should be happy.
[01:17:54.580 --> 01:17:56.540]   I'm going to be crying in joy.
[01:17:56.540 --> 01:17:58.980]   Anyway, we'll broadcast that live.
[01:17:58.980 --> 01:18:00.980]   I'm going to talk about that.
[01:18:00.980 --> 01:18:01.980]   You're just a plug.
[01:18:01.980 --> 01:18:02.980]   That was just a tease ahead.
[01:18:02.980 --> 01:18:03.980]   Yeah.
[01:18:03.980 --> 01:18:06.860]   I want you to watch me picture in picture as I ball my head off.
[01:18:06.860 --> 01:18:09.500]   How much will Leo cry to an intudate?
[01:18:09.500 --> 01:18:12.140]   It's a very special twit.
[01:18:12.140 --> 01:18:17.660]   John C. Devorak's at channel Devorak.com where you can see all of his many enterprises,
[01:18:17.660 --> 01:18:24.380]   including Cranky Geeks, No Agenda, Take Tech Five, and of course Devorak.org/blog.
[01:18:24.380 --> 01:18:27.900]   Patrick Norton, I'm going to give him a plug even though he doesn't deserve it, the SOB.
[01:18:27.900 --> 01:18:29.780]   There's a techzilla TA can all.
[01:18:29.780 --> 01:18:30.780]   I love Patrick.
[01:18:30.780 --> 01:18:32.420]   I love you.
[01:18:32.420 --> 01:18:34.500]   Just wash your hands before you kiss me.
[01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:41.380]   T E K Z I L L A dot com where he appears with the lovely Veronica Belmont.
[01:18:41.380 --> 01:18:42.380]   You almost called her Victoria.
[01:18:42.380 --> 01:18:43.540]   I almost did every time.
[01:18:43.540 --> 01:18:45.900]   I saw that every time.
[01:18:45.900 --> 01:18:46.900]   Why is that?
[01:18:46.900 --> 01:18:48.220]   I don't know.
[01:18:48.220 --> 01:18:50.180]   She looks more like a Victoria than a Veronica.
[01:18:50.180 --> 01:18:51.660]   We've had this conversation.
[01:18:51.660 --> 01:18:56.220]   I was sitting behind her during the Joe Koch concert and she's lovely.
[01:18:56.220 --> 01:18:57.980]   I'm back, the nape of her neck.
[01:18:57.980 --> 01:18:58.980]   Okay, okay.
[01:18:58.980 --> 01:18:59.980]   That's enough.
[01:18:59.980 --> 01:19:00.980]   I better stop right now.
[01:19:00.980 --> 01:19:02.980]   Ladies and gentlemen, another twit.
[01:19:02.980 --> 01:19:08.740]   He's in the can.
[01:19:08.740 --> 01:19:09.740]   Sing with us.
[01:19:09.740 --> 01:19:10.740]   Come on, Tom.
[01:19:10.740 --> 01:19:11.740]   You know the words.
[01:19:11.740 --> 01:19:12.740]   Sing a lot.
[01:19:12.740 --> 01:19:13.740]   Hi.
[01:19:13.740 --> 01:19:14.740]   Cut it.
[01:19:14.740 --> 01:19:15.740]   Go.
[01:19:15.740 --> 01:19:16.740]   Pathological monsters.
[01:19:16.740 --> 01:19:17.740]   Cry the terrified mathematician.
[01:19:17.740 --> 01:19:20.740]   Every one of them is a splinter in my eye.
[01:19:20.740 --> 01:19:26.540]   I hate the peanut space and the coke curve.
[01:19:26.540 --> 01:19:29.180]   I fear the cantor turnary shit.
[01:19:29.180 --> 01:19:33.980]   And the sopinski gasket makes me want to cry.
[01:19:33.980 --> 01:19:35.980]   And a million miles away.
[01:19:35.980 --> 01:19:38.820]   Okay, you don't have to listen to this guy.
[01:19:38.820 --> 01:19:39.820]   I'm just going to play it.
[01:19:39.820 --> 01:19:42.820]   But I was hoping Tom heard his signal.
[01:19:42.820 --> 01:19:44.620]   He's not going to snip him.
[01:19:44.620 --> 01:19:45.620]   He's not going to do it.
[01:19:45.620 --> 01:19:46.620]   He's not going to do it.
[01:19:46.620 --> 01:19:47.620]   He's not going to do it.
[01:19:47.620 --> 01:19:48.620]   He's not going to do it.
[01:19:48.620 --> 01:19:49.620]   He's not going to do it.
[01:19:49.620 --> 01:19:50.620]   He's not going to do it.
[01:19:50.620 --> 01:19:51.620]   He's not going to do it.
[01:19:51.620 --> 01:19:52.620]   He's not going to do it.
[01:19:52.620 --> 01:19:53.620]   He's not going to do it.
[01:19:53.620 --> 01:19:54.620]   He's not going to do it.
[01:19:54.620 --> 01:19:55.620]   He's not going to do it.
[01:19:55.620 --> 01:19:56.620]   He's not going to do it.
[01:19:56.620 --> 01:19:57.620]   He's not going to do it.
