[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:29.000]   why people are taking so many selfies, and why highway fatalities are up. Are they related? It's all coming up next on Twit.

[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   Time for Twit this week in Tech, the show where we cover the week's tech.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   News and we have a great one for you today.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   I am thrilled to get some of my favorite people on the show starting.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   With somebody who hasn't been on an age's, Veraton de Thurston is here.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   And all this time I didn't know you had a gag order.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   [laughter]
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   It's good to be back, Leo. Thanks for having me. Good to be back with an esteemed guest.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   And yeah, I was working for about nine and a half months to help relaunch the new Daily Show,
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   whichever Noah from last August to May. And I just didn't, in part, have time.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   That job is insanely demanding and also required some approvals to do things that had normally come naturally.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   So it was a more of a pain logistically and bureaucratically to be here.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   Yeah, I understand.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Good to be in my voice.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   Noah, thanks for having me.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   I was taking it personally so I'm really glad that--
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   Oh, it was also that.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   Oh, okay.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   [laughter]
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   It was definitely personal.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   I really-- I took the job so that I wouldn't have to come in.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   [laughter]
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   People to email.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   People to look for who doesn't read emails.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   It's just very chat.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   I don't read emails so that's good. I didn't see all that stuff.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   But sometimes your team sends them and they have to read emails.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Yeah, my team reads and sends emails.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   I've been trying to convince them of other people.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   We have the best way to deal with email.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   Have other people doing it for you.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   It's really true.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   You're creating jobs.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   It's beautiful.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   Bear 10 days book, "How to be Black from Harper."
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   And he's also the creator of and one of the hosts on "Penna Please About Race" podcast.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   Showaboutrace.com.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   That you just recently started that up.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   That's been going for about a year and a half.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   Oh, wow.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   We took a bit of hiatus because one of our hosts was writing multiple books.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   I was doing the Daily Show thing.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   But funny thing, we got a lot to talk about nowadays.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   That show was going weekly.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   Yeah, good.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   There's a whole crew of regulars beyond just the three founders, Raquel Tanner and myself.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   Awesome.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   So it's getting even more interesting, sadly, but also excitingly.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   So thrilled to have you also with us, Georgia Dow, who was an old friend from iMore.com
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   and regular on, I'm sure many of their podcasts, but we're glad to have you on ours.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   Whenever we can, Georgia is a psychotherapist besides being a tech writer.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   And we may need you today.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   Oh, that's one here.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   Already.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   I've been going through the five stages of grief with you just to make sure I'm on track.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   How are you doing?
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   You know, I had added two more.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   I think I got stuck.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   And so, but I'm going to go back to bargaining and continue on from there.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   Okay.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   If that's all right with you.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   Can we make a deal?
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   We can make a deal.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   Okay.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   Also here, Owen, JJ, Stone, we call him, oh, doctor from iQMZ.com.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   Good to see you.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   But you, my friend, the Eagles are losing.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   You're lucky that I love you.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   I come here on these Sundays on my holiday is the list.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   I forget winter.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   I've been spending time with you.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   I can't even look at the TV.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   I got to pay attention to the show and talk about technology.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   That's the kind of grief I'm living in.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   That's what I need.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   Five stages of help from.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   Oh, that's nothing.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   I'm a Niners fan.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   That's nothing.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   That's nothing.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   I don't even have to check to see if the Niners are there.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   You sure don't.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   You just don't let them.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   Don't let them happy the next day when they win.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   People get excited for you.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   Hey, they've catch it up.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   Okay.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   There we go.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   I'm not supposed to say anything because apparently somebody in their chat room has decided to tape
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   the game and watch the show instead.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   So I want no spoilers.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   No sports.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   I will tell you what Westworld is all about, but nothing about the Niners.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   I love Westworld.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   Do you?
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   Even watch it.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   Yes.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   My most action.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   Must happen.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.500]   Before you watch it, Beritunde, I would, in fact, I wish I had.
[00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:01.000]   I would read some of the fan theories about it because before you watch it.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   I haven't watched it.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   I've seen it.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   Oh, wait.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   You've seen it.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   You haven't watched it.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   I confuse you two.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   Still, we've seen it.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   We've seen it a whole practice round before we went live.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   I haven't watched it.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   I'm going to be watching.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   You're to the way left.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   No.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   Actually, I'm going to cop to something because after you listened to last week's show, Beritunde,
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   you were very upset.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   And direct message me, which I was grateful because you didn't do it.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   You didn't tweet me in public.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   You DM'd me.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   And I think we talked it through, right?
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   No, we definitely did.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   And I think, look, I'm trying to practice good citizenry in all forms.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   And that includes, like, if I disagree with someone not going straight to the public, but
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   actually talking directly to the person, it's something that gentrifiers don't do.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   They call the cops instead of just talking to their neighbors about turning the music down.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   So I didn't want to do that to you.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   Thanks.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   And I appreciate the back and forth that we had.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   And honestly, I feel a lot better.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   Look, the election is very hot topic.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   I specifically had message Leo for those who were like, "Why were you mad?"
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   Because I just thought he was cutting people off a bit much when they thought that Facebook
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   at all had some responsibility.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   And as the show went on, that conversation did open up.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   Obviously, that topic has opened up even more this week.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   And I've done a lot more boxing and yoga and housework.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   So I've burned off a lot of my aggression.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   You know what I was doing?
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   I was the guy at Thanksgiving dinner who said, "Can we not talk about politics, please?"
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   And I lost that battle.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   And I understand.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   I mean, it really is part of the nation's dialogue right now.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   How about Canada, Georgia?
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   Is it different up north?
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   Do you look down at us below the 49th parallel?
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   No, no.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   First of all, do you look down at us?
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   Like, right?
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   Do you?
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   Already, I'm being Eurocentric.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   I know Canada is not above us.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   It's kind of over there.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   But do you...
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   What?
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   What do they...
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   Well, no, because on the map, you know, on the map, it looks like, you know, in Canada,
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   the United States, Mexico, but that's just a map.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   It's not like they're really above us.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   They're north of us.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   In fact, my kid's school has an upside-down map just to kind of break through the Euro.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   What kind of school do you submit your children to?
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   What?
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   What?
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   You...
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   Look, this is why...
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   This is Northern California, dammit.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   Open-minded.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   I'm far to the left, and that's crazy.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   Didn't Apple do something this week?
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   Let's get started.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   All right, all right.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   Let's get started.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   But you're saying...
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   That was what I was trying to do.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   Probably it was foolish in hindsight.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   It was foolish to try to curtail the conversations that let's talk to the bad tech.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   And one of the things that really is true...
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   We do focus on tech, and we've had a lot of conversation behind the scenes, all the hosts
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   about how much we want to talk about politics.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   And we decided that really our charter is to talk about tech, and to the degree that politics
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   interferes with tech or involves tech, we certainly will talk about it.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   And there's quite a bit to talk about there, including fake news on Facebook and so forth.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   The FCC, moving forward.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   The little house stuff.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   There's a lot there.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   But I want to...
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   What I don't want to do is have our audience, which comes to us, I think somewhat for a respite
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   from the...
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   What was incessant political talk to just say, "Well, there's nowhere I can turn now
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   because that's all anybody's talking about."
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   Right.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   But I completely understood what you were saying, and I didn't disagree with you.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   I'm trying to mediate my own progressive tongue as much as anything.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   No, I think we're good.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   I think, look, if there's a tech angle to even what we're talking about now, for me, it's
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   that we have the ability to message each other and actually have conversation.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   We often choose to heighten discord and tension for the sake of performing our disagreements,
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   rather than honestly seeking to deal with them.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   Well, and Twitter facilitates that in ways that...
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   In my opinion, destructive.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   That works encouraging.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   Yeah, they...
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   If your message is not public, it can't be monetized.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:29.720]   I have had horrible Twitter fights with people, lost friends on Twitter because of intemperate
[00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:35.200]   things I've said and probably would never have said in public in person, but Twitter
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:37.000]   just kind of lends itself.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   I know you don't like Twitter.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   You just drop by the so and so.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   Because you just be Twitter-bash and like, "Twitter's like the kid you just don't like,"
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.800]   and you be telling everybody all the time, "That kid's always messing up."
[00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:48.800]   My last podcast was called Facebook Power Ticket.
[00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:51.160]   I didn't have a basic story.
[00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:52.160]   I sit in the middle.
[00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:53.160]   I see both sides.
[00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:54.800]   I say, "Well, they mean this, and they mean that."
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:56.400]   And I try to have a conversation.
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:01.440]   I had somebody come into my comment and say, "You don't support O, and if you voted for
[00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:04.040]   Trump, you're just a racist, blah, blah, blah."
[00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:06.520]   Now, this is a white woman that I happen to sleep with.
[00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:09.880]   And I'm saying, "Why are you yelling at this person and calling them a racist, Tony Habye?
[00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:12.040]   You don't know my relationship with this person."
[00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:16.040]   But people go insane in their mind when they pick their size and they play their games.
[00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:16.040]   But Twitter-
[00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:18.440]   Because they're like, "Brenton, they said, 'Talking to each other.'"
[00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:19.440]   Twitter?
[00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:20.440]   And these are people you know.
[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:21.440]   Twitter facilitates this.
[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:22.440]   Twitter's the imaginary person.
[00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:24.440]   But if you just-
[00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:25.440]   But if you just take the attention to it-
[00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:27.640]   Well, I don't.
[00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:29.240]   I think you shouldn't pay attention to it.
[00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:31.440]   The internet does it, Leo, to Internet.
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:32.640]   It's the Internet.
[00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:38.520]   And then I feel like I contributed to some derailing, Leo, because I'm going to try to
[00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:42.000]   help maintain the thread and undo some of the damage I may have done by taking this off.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   You were asking Georgia how things were going up north.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   Up north.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   Down north.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   But up north.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   Side north in Canada.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   The assets.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   I said Apple.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.400]   Usually when I say Apple, he's like Apple?
[00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:58.800]   Oh, I got a lot to say about Apple, buddy.
[00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:00.400]   I am pissed off about Apple.
[00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:01.400]   Let me tell you something.
[00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:02.400]   Tell me.
[00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:04.400]   We're going to get to that and just take it.
[00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:05.400]   But Georgia?
[00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:06.400]   Ah!
[00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:07.400]   Just one.
[00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:08.400]   We're in shock.
[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:09.400]   Yeah.
[00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:12.400]   We're in shock.
[00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:13.400]   Is there a sense?
[00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:14.400]   Well, I mean, everybody's in shock.
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:20.240]   But is there a sense that it could be bad news for Canada?
[00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:24.920]   Or are you just worried about a whole bunch of people moving there?
[00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:29.640]   There's a lot of people planning on moving here.
[00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:32.680]   It isn't as easy to immigrate to Canada as people think.
[00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:37.440]   But no, I think that people are genuinely worried what's going to happen with our trade
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:38.440]   agreements.
[00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:41.720]   That's our biggest trade partner.
[00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:45.080]   So a lot of things could be changed because of that.
[00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:51.560]   And also just to see the strife that's happening to our neighbors is hard for us because this
[00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:55.560]   is something that we can't actually apologize for.
[00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:56.560]   Perfect.
[00:12:56.560 --> 00:13:00.560]   I'm so glad we brought it back to Canada.
[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:02.560]   That was the best.
[00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:03.560]   All right.
[00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:05.680]   Let's, I'll tell you what, let's defer.
[00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:11.400]   Let's deflect it to England for a moment because they have now passed the Snoopers charter,
[00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:16.560]   Theresa May, who is the current Prime Minister after Brexit in Great Britain, had proposed
[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:20.800]   this years ago and has pushed it several times, never been able to get it through Parliament.
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:24.200]   Now both houses of Parliament, Commons and the Lords have approved it.
[00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:27.960]   It awaits the sovereign's approval, believe it or not.
[00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:31.240]   And once the Queen says, yes.
[00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:35.280]   Once the Queen says, okay, which apparently is pro forma, I don't think she will weigh
[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:43.280]   in on this, the actual name of it is the investigatory powers act.
[00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:50.320]   It is according to, well, I'll read what Corey Doctorow says in Boing Boing.
[00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:53.600]   And by the way, Corey lived and London for many years is very well aware of the issues
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:54.600]   there.
[00:13:54.600 --> 00:14:00.160]   The most extreme surveillance law in Europe more extreme than the Patriot Act.
[00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:06.400]   And Snowden, in fact, tweeted at, I think yesterday, he says, it goes farther than many
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:11.680]   autocracies, new spying powers to the government.
[00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:17.480]   The government now will require all ISPs to save everything you do online to make it
[00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:21.080]   available to the government on demand.
[00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:27.080]   It also undermines scriptography.
[00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:32.160]   This picture of Theresa May shaking Putin's hand is a little bit inflammatory because I
[00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:35.680]   don't know if they're really related to the story.
[00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:40.120]   But it is the law that we have in the United States been very afraid of.
[00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:45.400]   There have been rumblings that this would happen in the United States as well.
[00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:47.880]   Extreme surveillance.
[00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:51.240]   And how did they justify it?
[00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:53.160]   Well, that's the interesting thing.
[00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:57.800]   I mean, I guess the overall justification for this and the Patriot Act was a fear of terrorism.
[00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:02.880]   And it's felt that law enforcement needs these tools to fight terrorism.
[00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:09.800]   And I presume that that's the argument made in the UK, although I don't see much of that.
[00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:13.200]   Snowden tweeted the UK just legalized the most extreme surveillance in the history of Western
[00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:14.200]   democracy.
[00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:17.040]   It goes further than many autocracy.
[00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:21.240]   It includes bulk data collection by the GCHQ.
[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:23.440]   By the way, GCHQ works with the NSA.
[00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:30.400]   So this is something that probably the NSA would like to pass as well.
[00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:39.280]   Apparently, President-elect Trump's nominee for the CIA head is kind of an interesting
[00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:48.160]   -- again, we seem to have to read a lot of tea leaves when it comes to what Donald Trump
[00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:57.680]   wants to do, but Mike Pompeo, who is a member of Congress, he's on the Intelligence Committee,
[00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:02.400]   has both said he wants to increase mass surveillance.
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:06.680]   He has said he thinks using encryption is a red flag.
[00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:09.040]   And I use encryption whenever I can.
[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:12.320]   But he also says he doesn't believe in backdoors in encryption.
[00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:14.640]   Okay, that's good.
[00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:18.000]   So it's an interesting mix, isn't it?
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   Yeah.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.880]   I mean, I feel like we've been here before.
[00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:30.360]   And we should all be taking care to erase things that shouldn't just exist in the hands
[00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:34.680]   of these companies who already have shown that they can't hold on to it with or without
[00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:35.680]   government orders.
[00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:36.680]   Like Yahoo!
[00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:39.440]   Target, name a company, they've lost your data.
[00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:43.200]   So we don't exactly need the government to come along and ask for it.
[00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:48.440]   They will probably be leaking it out a side door as we speak and then using encryption
[00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:52.280]   tools, just good, healthy internet practice, like something I'm trying to be better about
[00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:53.280]   myself.
[00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:57.280]   But yeah, this seems like an obviously not good thing, like an obviously bad thing.
[00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:01.280]   Anybody want to argue in favor of a digital police state?
[00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:04.720]   If you're not doing anything wrong, you don't have a real story about it.
[00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:07.320]   And you're saying that facetiously, I know and I don't think-
[00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:08.320]   No, I'm not.
[00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:12.760]   As a non-criminal entity, a person who's not somewhere in a basement in an undisclosed
[00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:15.120]   location, I have nothing to fear but I'm here.
[00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:16.120]   I love you.
[00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:17.120]   You're back.
[00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:18.120]   He's in the dark.
[00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:21.760]   That's just so that people can't find out where he's located.
[00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:22.760]   Well, we should.
[00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:26.320]   By the way, he'll never say that on there, but we should point out that Owen has rarely
[00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:28.800]   been arrested when he's pulled over for driving while black.
[00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:30.280]   So that's good too, right?
[00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:31.280]   That's great.
[00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:32.280]   Yeah, that's great.
[00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:33.520]   It works out my favor.
[00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:34.920]   How many times this year?
[00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:36.920]   What is the current count?
[00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:37.920]   24.
[00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:43.920]   I'm just going to let that six in a little bit.
[00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:50.120]   63 times the last three years and I've only gotten 16 tickets.
[00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:53.920]   So most of the time they pulled me over, they realized that I'm a black guy named Owen and
[00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:55.920]   they say, "Hey, and then they let me go."
[00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:56.920]   Really?
[00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:57.920]   Because it's the Owen?
[00:17:57.920 --> 00:17:58.920]   It's getting you off the hook.
[00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:03.200]   Oh, a guy pulled me over one time when I was in my hybrid and he's like, "Oh, it?"
[00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:04.200]   And I'm like, "Yeah.
[00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:05.200]   Hybrid, huh?"
[00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:07.400]   Yep, not thugging and bugging and alexus.
[00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:08.400]   We're sorry.
[00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:11.800]   No, they're pulling you over because you are a curiosity.
[00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:14.600]   They're like, "Wait, that is a black man in hybrid."
[00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:15.600]   I got full of him.
[00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:16.600]   I got full of him.
[00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:20.560]   Oh, and oh my God, they probably have a back channel where they just swap your picture
[00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:21.560]   amongst themselves.
[00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:22.560]   I got him too.
[00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:23.560]   He's got a full of this guy over.
[00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:24.560]   He's a hoo.
[00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:25.560]   Yeah.
[00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:27.120]   I drove by cop.
[00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:28.120]   I got a really loud radio.
[00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:29.120]   There's like 3000 watts.
[00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:30.120]   I'll be bumping.
[00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:32.440]   I rode by a cop bumping Taylor Swift and he pulled me over.
[00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:34.200]   I'm like, "Is Taylor Swift?"
[00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:37.200]   I'm like, "What on an A-Fingy and A-Fingy?"
[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:40.920]   Honestly, I don't know if that counts as racism or not.
[00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:43.760]   I think that's just novelty.
[00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:44.760]   I think that's confusing.
[00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:45.760]   Something.
[00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:46.760]   I'm like a unicorn.
[00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:47.760]   They want to shake my hands.
[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:48.760]   Yeah.
[00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:54.240]   But the excuse is used, and it's clearly racial profiling, but the excuse is used, the same
[00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:58.120]   excuse that's the Snooper's Charter and the Patriot Act, that as long as you're doing
[00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:02.400]   nothing wrong, we're doing everything we can to protect our neighborhoods, to protect against
[00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:03.400]   terrorism.
[00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:06.640]   And as long as you're doing nothing wrong, you have nothing to fear.
[00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:08.640]   This is, you know, stopping frisk.
[00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:09.640]   This is just...
[00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:10.640]   Yeah.
[00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:17.520]   And I think, look, to take the metaphor further, it's not like, "Oh, and you've somehow...
[00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:22.280]   You are a unicorn, not because you love Taylor Swift, Java, hybrid, and are named Owen, but
[00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:24.880]   because you've survived all these encounters."
[00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:29.480]   That's your way beyond the data plot for any reasonable cluster.
[00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:30.480]   You're an outlier.
[00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:31.480]   No, it's a big...
[00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:32.480]   Owen's a big scary guy.
[00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:38.920]   And because of how many times you've lived, like you've lived 63 times.
[00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:41.320]   And that's a terrible way to think of it.
[00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:42.320]   Oh my God.
[00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:43.920]   But that's the scary thing.
[00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:50.560]   And when you take all this abuse of power, right, most cops don't abuse power, it just
[00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:52.800]   takes a few to really skew the system.
[00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:55.960]   Let's say it's 5%, that's still way too many.
[00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:59.680]   Now, because they have guns and badges which shield them from accountability for use of
[00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:03.720]   those guns, they are encouraged, the bad ones, to keep doing bad things.
[00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:10.840]   So now you give the government all this surveillance, snooping, history, browsing, and hacking power,
[00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:15.640]   and 5%, 10%, what is the digital version of pulling all over Owen?
[00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:20.720]   Who are the communities that are going to be subject to abuse by this power?
[00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:24.480]   It's probably not Leo Laport in general.
[00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:28.960]   It's probably Muslim brothers and sisters, depending on the society we're talking about,
[00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:30.400]   different groups are going to be targeted by this.
[00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:35.600]   So that burden of non-accountability is going to be born by some people who really are already
[00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:37.560]   going through some tough times as it is.
[00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:41.880]   It's just the risk of abuse, which has been proven to happen, is one of the main reasons
[00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:46.240]   why you don't concentrate this much power in such narrow hands.
[00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:47.240]   It's still obvious.
[00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:53.880]   You know how many times I have been pulled over for jamming 50 cents as loud as I can
[00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:54.880]   in my Tesla?
[00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:55.880]   You know how many times this year?
[00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:56.880]   Actually, in the last three years.
[00:20:56.880 --> 00:21:00.760]   There is no artist named 50 cents.
[00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:03.400]   >> He's only one person.
[00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:05.200]   He's not multiple.
[00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:06.680]   >> 50 cents.
[00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:07.680]   >> 50 cents.
[00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:14.080]   >> The thing I'm waiting for is for a government to have this power and for them to get hacked.
[00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:20.000]   And for millions of regular citizens to have their non-criminal information put out there,
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.760]   just some old perverted funky stuff they got going on, they sleep with socks, I don't know
[00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:26.880]   what kind of weird stuff people are doing, but that might get hacked and leaked out
[00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:27.880]   to the world.
[00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:28.880]   And then what are they going to say?
[00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:33.000]   You've been housing all this stupid information for waiting for somebody else to come in there
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   and get ahold of it.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.840]   >> Let me, let me, here's a question.
[00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:42.680]   If one of the proposals is to create a registry of Muslims in the United States, I imagine
[00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:43.680]   if that --
[00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:45.280]   >> I mean Amazon probably has that.
[00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:47.840]   >> Well, first of all, you don't need to create a registry.
[00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:48.840]   You could probably figure it out.
[00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:53.200]   In fact, we had heard, and I don't know if it was ever proven, but that among other things
[00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:57.800]   that the Patriot did, of course, you can with a national security letter and other means
[00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:01.560]   query, grocery stores, and they can't say anything about it.
[00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:04.200]   And you could say, well, how many -- who's eating hummus?
[00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:06.560]   You know, I mean, you could literally do that.
[00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:08.560]   >> No, but that's every upwardly mobile --
[00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:09.560]   >> That's the problem.
[00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:10.560]   It doesn't work in Marin.
[00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:12.200]   It might work in Philly, I don't know.
[00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:13.200]   >> You do the data.
[00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:14.200]   >> Yeah.
[00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:17.640]   But I wonder if something like that happened, what kind of civil disobedience would happen?
[00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:19.120]   >> I think we all register.
[00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:20.120]   >> We'd all register, wouldn't we?
[00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:21.120]   >> I mean, we'd --
[00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:22.120]   >> I mean, we'd --
[00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:26.400]   >> Even though that that could be risky, this is the thing that really will be the test.
[00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:31.560]   Would people -- people like me step forward and register, even though that might be a risky
[00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:32.560]   thing to do?
[00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:35.800]   >> I mean, that's -- yeah, I'm going to -- I've been talking so much.
[00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:37.840]   Let me let somebody else weigh in.
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:38.840]   Sorry.
[00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:42.280]   >> People -- we're -- unfortunately, we become complacent way too easily.
[00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:46.680]   If it's not about us, if it doesn't directly affect us, rarely do people do something because
[00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:50.400]   that puts them in an eye, and that makes them feel like they're going to be targeted.
[00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:55.000]   And so, unfortunately, it only -- it takes things to become really bad before people
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:59.480]   decide now I have to get up and fight because this is for all of us, right?
[00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:04.760]   Like if this can be done to one person, then it could eventually be done to you as well.
[00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:08.400]   But people only get upset when it's something that affects themselves or a loved one, and
[00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:10.640]   we're becoming more and more boxed in.
[00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:15.720]   Like as we become more attached to, like, the internet and social media and other things
[00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:20.840]   that kind of keep us away from general people at large, we become able to survive without
[00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:22.520]   having to actually deal with things.
[00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:26.560]   Like we don't have to open up a browser that's dealing with a difficult subject that we don't
[00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:27.560]   really want to deal with.
[00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:31.400]   So it's much easier for us to turn a blind eye and feel like everything is going to be
[00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:32.400]   okay.
[00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:36.200]   And when things get really bad, it has to be -- it's becoming unfortunately worse and
[00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:40.080]   worse before people will actually take up a stand and say this is something that I need
[00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:41.400]   to fight for.
[00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:47.280]   And that's a really dangerous area of social psychology because we end up with that group
[00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:49.760]   think of us and them.
[00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:53.960]   And that's really, really dangerous because in the end, it's all us.
[00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:55.760]   >> In general, go ahead.
[00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:59.560]   >> In general, I'd say Georgia, you are 1,000% right.
[00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:03.760]   But since you live in the glory land of this Canada, you have not been here in America for
[00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:06.440]   the last 24 months when it's been protest central.
[00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:08.040]   You don't like somebody wearing a blue shirt?
[00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:09.140]   We protest net.
[00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:12.200]   You don't like the president that won a fair election even knows how to talk about we protest
[00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:13.200]   net.
[00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:14.200]   >> Isn't there a risk now?
[00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:16.700]   >> Isn't there a risk of crying wolf?
[00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:20.620]   Too much protesting then when there's something really serious to protest, everybody goes,
[00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:21.620]   "There they go again."
[00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:24.340]   >> I'm not trying to drive down that street right now, Leo.
[00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:27.300]   I'm just saying that people are actually getting up out of their miles basement, which
[00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:30.180]   I'm not currently in and getting out into these streets.
[00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:34.020]   >> Somebody's based now and cared to get on the street.
[00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:36.980]   More and more people are doing it and yes, the cry wolf thing comes into effect, but
[00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:38.540]   at least people are doing it.
[00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:41.340]   Instead of a hashtag this, people are hitting the streets.
[00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:44.660]   I would like to they hit the streets with more of a purpose and direction, but at least
[00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:45.660]   they're hitting the streets.
[00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:50.380]   >> When we talk about privacy, there's really a couple of issues.
[00:24:50.380 --> 00:24:53.780]   It's not merely government snooping.
[00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:58.460]   I think at least so far that might be an overblown concern.
[00:24:58.460 --> 00:25:00.820]   There's also the issue of commercial snooping.
[00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:06.940]   Uber, for instance, has just changed its terms of service for people who use the Uber car
[00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:08.100]   service.
[00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:11.940]   Uber may and you Uber's sole discretion permit you from time to time to submit, upload,
[00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:17.740]   publish, or otherwise make available to Uber textual, audio, and visual content, commentary
[00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:21.060]   and feedback by providing user content to Uber.
[00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:24.900]   You grant over a worldwide perpetual irrevocable transferable royalty free license.
[00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:28.260]   We've all seen this to sub license use cop.
[00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:31.820]   In other words, Uber is saying anything we get from you.
[00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:35.660]   We can use without further notice or consent from you without the requirement of payment
[00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:36.660]   to you.
[00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:38.900]   I'm seeing this as a grab.
[00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:42.620]   Remember, when you get an Uber, they're gathering all sorts of information about you, where
[00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:47.740]   you've been, where you're going, who you are, if you've got Spotify, what you're listening
[00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:50.740]   to because they tie into your Spotify account.
[00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:53.580]   Now apparently this is all becoming grist for the mill.
[00:25:53.580 --> 00:26:00.980]   If I have an Amazon Echo and I do everywhere in my house, the Echo, as an example, could
[00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:06.620]   be listening to what TV shows I'm watching, make record of that, sell it to the networks
[00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:07.620]   as ratings information.
[00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:11.900]   It'd actually be the best ratings tool the networks ever had.
[00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:14.540]   That's another kind of snooping that is an issue.
[00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:19.180]   There's a third issue with this, which is a security issue because if the government
[00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:24.260]   can snoop on you, back doors in your encryption or whatever, if commercial entities can snoop
[00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:29.020]   on you, hackers can also use these avenues to not only snoop on you, but to mess with
[00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:30.020]   you.
[00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:32.420]   All three of these are issues.
[00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:36.700]   The government is only one of these three that owns guns, of course, and nuclear weapons,
[00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:39.900]   but they're all to be concerned about.
[00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:40.900]   Yes?
[00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:41.900]   Absolutely.
[00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:50.660]   I think we also, when we went digital, we stopped physically owning a lot of the production
[00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:51.660]   of our lives.
[00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:57.700]   If you took a picture before in the analog world, you could develop it yourself or you
[00:26:57.700 --> 00:27:01.140]   could go to one hour photo and hope they didn't make copies.
[00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:07.420]   That was yours to lose in a fire, to sell, to misplace in an attic and discover 50 years
[00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:09.620]   later and be really excited by it.
[00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:15.300]   But now, so much that we produce about ourselves, our location, our thoughts, our memos, our
[00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:20.340]   notes to self are physically owned by someone else.
[00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:22.540]   There's a land grab that's been made.
[00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:25.140]   You're not just a phone company customer.
[00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:30.100]   You're a rich source of data and insights that's monetizable, that you didn't really
[00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:32.020]   sign up for, not actively.
[00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:36.860]   It's this retroactive, oh, by the way, we own your family and your children in perpetuity,
[00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:42.620]   in all forms of media, in all modes of time and space and the intersection thereof.
[00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:49.500]   We have been late as citizens, much less consumers, but as citizens, to claim ourselves.
[00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:54.340]   This is something you mentioned in the SEC earlier, oh, Dr. Tom Wheeler released a recent
[00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:57.460]   policy which is with respect to the telcos.
[00:27:57.460 --> 00:28:01.020]   Data is ours and you have to check with us before you do all kinds of things.
[00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:06.500]   What Uber is doing is sadly common because everybody's got the same lawyers and they're
[00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:12.420]   all working with the same, generally behind the times, overwhelmed and perhaps totally
[00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:17.340]   unaware user base that doesn't know what to do about this even if made aware of it.
[00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:18.980]   What are we supposed to do?
[00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:22.780]   Saying don't use stuff is just saying just say no.
[00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:27.660]   These services have been made so integral and so addictive in our lives that saying not
[00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:32.380]   to use them is pretty meaningless for a significant portion of the population whose employers
[00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:38.100]   demand it, whose friend networks demand it, whose sense of self is so tied into it, which
[00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:39.780]   was like a perfect drug.
[00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:40.780]   So how do we fight it?
[00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:41.780]   What do we do?
[00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:46.620]   Well, first of all, we get that Facebook notice that we pass around and says, I hear by declare
[00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:58.060]   my Facebook contract says by posting this, I am not Facebook.
[00:28:58.060 --> 00:29:03.060]   Listen to my joke to how it rolls in that for you cut me off and let me go ahead.
[00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:07.820]   That's the general way to do this because the laymen people, people that are not in your
[00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:11.100]   bubble or even my bubble don't understand these things.
[00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:23.620]   Once the crowd gets to hear about, you just say Uber's gonna steal all your stuff.
[00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:27.060]   Because when you sign up for Uber and you scroll through that five page thing and click
[00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:30.940]   okay because you're trying to get a ride home in the rain, you don't have time to read that.
[00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:35.780]   These people do a very good job of not informing their customer base about what they're doing.
[00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:40.500]   And usually what happens is, again, somebody gets screwed over and something bad happens
[00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:42.380]   and then everybody will know about it.
[00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:45.380]   And then they have an uproar like with Facebook and taking people's pictures and things like
[00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:46.380]   that.
[00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:48.220]   So we just need to inform people better.
[00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:52.660]   There needs to be some law that puts in chunk form, simple, bite form.
[00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:54.420]   Hey, we're using your stuff.
[00:29:54.420 --> 00:29:55.860]   And if you want it opt out, do it.
[00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:59.740]   If not, don't use our service because it's all hidden away in those long form contracts
[00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:01.100]   people don't know about.
[00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:03.540]   Well, I fully agree with you, Owen.
[00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:04.540]   But you know what?
[00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:06.780]   The other part of this is that we are fickle beasts.
[00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:11.540]   We're constantly sacrificing our future for the things that we want in the present.
[00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:15.420]   We don't think about the repercussions for our actions and we are way too short-sighted
[00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:18.420]   and nepotistic to really care.
[00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:23.420]   And like what, you know, Orwell really didn't think about is that we're the ones sticking
[00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:28.860]   our cameras everywhere, you know, installing them in our private rooms, carrying them wherever
[00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:29.940]   we go.
[00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:33.340]   And in the end, our biggest fear isn't that people are going to be watching us but that
[00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:34.860]   people might not be.
[00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:38.740]   And so we've created this ourselves.
[00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:42.100]   It's actually a nation, in other words, right?
[00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:44.780]   We've abdicated our own right to privacy.
[00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:45.780]   Oh my God.
[00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:49.060]   Don't make me get my full hat because watch this.
[00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:50.620]   Okay, Google.
[00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:52.180]   Okay, Alexa.
[00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:53.180]   Xbox on.
[00:30:53.180 --> 00:30:58.220]   I'll be unplugging everything when I'm not using it.
[00:30:58.220 --> 00:31:00.980]   Okay, Siri, you ain't listening to me about nothing.
[00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:06.420]   Yeah, but here you are on a podcast talking, like we are relatively public people.
[00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:08.420]   I don't have Alexa.
[00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:11.500]   I couldn't anyway, because I'm a candidate, but anyways, I wouldn't have it.
[00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:12.660]   I don't have Siri on.
[00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:14.500]   Nothing really listening to me.
[00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:19.900]   But I'm on Twitter and I hope to get more Twitter followers and I'm still, I do podcasts
[00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:24.740]   and people know probably a lot more about me than I really know that they know.
[00:31:24.740 --> 00:31:27.740]   So yeah, it's a problem too.
[00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:30.500]   But that's me putting out the best.
[00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:33.060]   The six to 185 pounds.
[00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:35.180]   I've been working out all morning version myself.
[00:31:35.180 --> 00:31:39.780]   I put out, you ain't going to get to just sneak in my house on my Alexa or my Google
[00:31:39.780 --> 00:31:42.500]   and find out what I'm over here doing because you wouldn't want to know.
[00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:45.660]   But what I put forth on my own accord is my decision.
[00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:46.660]   How about this?
[00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:51.620]   Coca-Cola has just introduced the selfie bottle in Israel.
[00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:57.580]   It's a bottle with a camera that shows you taking a picture of yourself drinking a Coca-Cola.
[00:31:57.580 --> 00:31:58.740]   I don't know if they actually.
[00:31:58.740 --> 00:32:04.540]   I cannot wait for the foul, disgusting things people are going to do with this bottle.
[00:32:04.540 --> 00:32:07.060]   It's going to get really interesting really fast.
[00:32:07.060 --> 00:32:14.980]   When every company's empowered people to express themselves, it takes about five minutes
[00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:16.540]   for folks to get real nasty.
[00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:20.580]   The kind of adult videos you just went right to it.
[00:32:20.580 --> 00:32:24.220]   I'm just saying, people are going to put it on their dogs.
[00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:26.780]   People are going to have all kinds of stuff with vehicles.
[00:32:26.780 --> 00:32:29.260]   It's going to get pretty nasty too.
[00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:34.300]   I'm just saying, Coke, this is great and horrible at the same time.
[00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:39.060]   Yeah, it was devised by a Gefan team for the Coca-Cola Summer Love campaign.
[00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:42.380]   It's an outdoor brand event in Israel.
[00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:47.700]   The selfies are taken when you tilt the bottle to 70 degrees and can be shared on Facebook,
[00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:50.460]   Snapchat and Instagram.
[00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:53.540]   I'd love to be on Coca-Cola.
[00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:56.260]   I feel like they seem to be doing anything they want.
[00:32:56.260 --> 00:33:00.140]   Doesn't this seem like this should be a fake news story and yet it's real?
[00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:05.380]   It's real and it's like this is such a, so here's another way they could have spun this.
[00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:14.140]   Coca-Cola, instead of creating this one-way data flow from the customer back to Coca-Cola
[00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:19.580]   servers so that they can monetize your image to get other people to create a relationship
[00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:24.700]   from themselves to other Coca-Cola servers, they could have created something that connected
[00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:26.660]   you to other Coca-Cola drinkers.
[00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:32.300]   They could have encouraged some level like community, find someone in your neighborhood.
[00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:37.660]   I don't know, I'm being a little cheesy right now but I think there's such a narrow imagination
[00:33:37.660 --> 00:33:42.620]   around how all these organizations and all these incentives are built which is just like
[00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:47.580]   they're treating us like the natural resource that they're mining and they'll discard us.
[00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:49.980]   That's the new way of business.
[00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:54.220]   Yeah, and it's so extractive and it's so lazy.
[00:33:54.220 --> 00:33:56.140]   Ultimately this is pretty lazy.
[00:33:56.140 --> 00:34:00.780]   I want them to step up if you're going to exploit me like at least make it more interesting
[00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:06.060]   but a selfie camera taped to the bottom of a Coke bottle is pretty low rent.
[00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:07.060]   Question Uncle Leo.
[00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:08.540]   Yes sir.
[00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:11.860]   Speaking of exploiting people and getting that money, don't we got to add reason?
[00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:13.860]   You are so good.
[00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:17.260]   Owen J.J. Stone knows how to monetize.
[00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:19.260]   You got to get that paper done.
[00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:20.260]   Nobody's business.
[00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:21.700]   Ain't nobody getting that 50 cents?
[00:34:21.700 --> 00:34:22.700]   You don't read them ads.
[00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:24.140]   Owen, you're the real thing.
[00:34:24.140 --> 00:34:25.700]   No, you're the real thing.
[00:34:25.700 --> 00:34:27.140]   I believe it.
[00:34:27.140 --> 00:34:31.780]   We will talk about an increase in selfie deaths just a bit.
[00:34:31.780 --> 00:34:32.780]   Thanks Coca-Cola.
[00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:33.780]   Thanks, it's your fault.
[00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:36.140]   Oh, they're going to say Coca-Cola.
[00:34:36.140 --> 00:34:37.660]   Someone's going to get sued.
[00:34:37.660 --> 00:34:38.660]   Oh, not me.
[00:34:38.660 --> 00:34:39.660]   Not me.
[00:34:39.660 --> 00:34:40.660]   I love Coca-Cola.
[00:34:40.660 --> 00:34:44.780]   I'll go to Coca-Cola prison for you guys.
[00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:45.780]   I'll do that for you.
[00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:51.020]   Lewis Black has a great routine about Coke and Pepsi.
[00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:53.740]   What's the difference?
[00:34:53.740 --> 00:34:54.740]   If you go to a restaurant...
[00:34:54.740 --> 00:34:55.740]   There's a difference.
[00:34:55.740 --> 00:34:56.740]   Yeah, I know.
[00:34:56.740 --> 00:34:59.140]   If you go to a restaurant and you say, "I'll have a Coke," and they say, "No, you only
[00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:00.140]   have Pepsi."
[00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:01.140]   What do you use?
[00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:02.140]   You storm out.
[00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:03.140]   You say, "No."
[00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:04.140]   I say, "No."
[00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:05.140]   I'm not eating here.
[00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:06.140]   I'm not having that.
[00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:07.140]   Oh dear.
[00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:08.140]   That's not even...
[00:35:08.140 --> 00:35:09.140]   I'm just a doctor.
[00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:10.140]   I'm just a doctor.
[00:35:10.140 --> 00:35:11.140]   Well, I'm glad you're brand loyal.
[00:35:11.140 --> 00:35:12.140]   You see Coke?
[00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:13.140]   You see?
[00:35:13.140 --> 00:35:14.140]   You see?
[00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:16.180]   I'd like to teach the world the same thing.
[00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:20.380]   Remember, they did that touchy-feely and perfect harmony and all that stuff.
[00:35:20.380 --> 00:35:21.580]   Money, Uncle Leo.
[00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:22.580]   Money.
[00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:24.620]   My money, Eric Cokes.
[00:35:24.620 --> 00:35:25.620]   Your money.
[00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:26.620]   Got to pick it.
[00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:29.220]   We've got to read the meds.
[00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:30.220]   Don't worry.
[00:35:30.220 --> 00:35:31.220]   It's all trickled down.
[00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:32.220]   You're going to get yours.
[00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:33.220]   I appreciate that.
[00:35:33.220 --> 00:35:34.220]   Yeah.
[00:35:34.220 --> 00:35:35.820]   This show is...
[00:35:35.820 --> 00:35:43.260]   I really do feel like a company that's well-run would look long-term and say ultimately our
[00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:51.700]   success requires a consumer base that has the money to spend and the interest to spend
[00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:53.980]   on our products.
[00:35:53.980 --> 00:36:00.340]   Focusing all the revenue into this company isn't a good long-term strategy, but they
[00:36:00.340 --> 00:36:02.180]   don't seem to be thinking long-term.
[00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:03.900]   They seem to think quarter to quarter.
[00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:07.700]   They want to make the stock market happy, so they don't care.
[00:36:07.700 --> 00:36:13.220]   They don't care if nobody can afford brownie paper towels or quilted northern toilet paper.
[00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:17.380]   They're going to make it now.
[00:36:17.380 --> 00:36:19.460]   That's why I'm going to pause for this commercial break.
[00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:21.460]   That was an amazing thing.
[00:36:21.460 --> 00:36:23.460]   I was like, "How is this related to it?"
[00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:25.740]   It's so nice to have you.
[00:36:25.740 --> 00:36:26.740]   veritunday.com.
[00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:28.780]   Be a R-A-T-U-N-D-E.com.
[00:36:28.780 --> 00:36:29.780]   He's at veritunday.
[00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:35.700]   Now that he's freed from the change of Trevor Noah, he can join us and speak to us.
[00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:36.700]   Was it fun working there?
[00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:37.700]   It was crazy.
[00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:41.180]   Yo, it was absolutely fun and absolutely crazy.
[00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:43.900]   And at times, absolutely unbearable.
[00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:46.820]   It's the most difficult job I've ever had.
[00:36:46.820 --> 00:36:48.140]   Hands down.
[00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:50.060]   I would do it all over again.
[00:36:50.060 --> 00:36:51.060]   Also hands down.
[00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:52.340]   Were you doing social media for them?
[00:36:52.340 --> 00:36:54.060]   What were you doing?
[00:36:54.060 --> 00:36:57.580]   That is a vast subset of what I was doing.
[00:36:57.580 --> 00:37:00.620]   I had this lofty title, which is "Supervise and Producer."
[00:37:00.620 --> 00:37:04.740]   I created a department that had not existed there before.
[00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:11.060]   We called it the expansion team, and it was All Things Digital, which included representing
[00:37:11.060 --> 00:37:14.060]   the show online and in social media.
[00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:20.460]   It also included helping the show create its own air content in a way that was more digitally
[00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:22.660]   sound or relevant.
[00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:28.780]   And it included creating all original content that was not in any way connected content-wise
[00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:32.260]   to what was airing on television last night or the upcoming night.
[00:37:32.260 --> 00:37:35.340]   Was that forward thinking of them or is every show now on the net?
[00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:36.820]   We're at every network doing that.
[00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:40.100]   I mean, to some degree, everybody's doing that.
[00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:46.900]   I'd like to think I had a more robust and comprehensive and probably insane, intense
[00:37:46.900 --> 00:37:50.380]   level of what I set the bar for that.
[00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:55.140]   But there is, I can't imagine any show that's not dabbling in at least some of those areas.
[00:37:55.140 --> 00:37:57.940]   And everybody understands the value of being on social media.
[00:37:57.940 --> 00:37:58.940]   But it has to be organic.
[00:37:58.940 --> 00:37:59.940]   It has to be native.
[00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:02.180]   It can't feel like you're trying.
[00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:05.580]   It can't be obvious that the point of all this is to get more viewers.
[00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:10.580]   Right?
[00:38:10.580 --> 00:38:14.180]   Watch our show tonight at 9, 8, 7, Central, what have you.
[00:38:14.180 --> 00:38:21.260]   Two extending for fiction and scripted series, extending characters between seasons so that
[00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:28.540]   they live and continue to have drama and scenes play out on Tumblr or in YouTube, micro series
[00:38:28.540 --> 00:38:29.820]   and things like that.
[00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:35.100]   They recognize the power of these non-linear formats to extend story.
[00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:37.420]   That's been pretty exciting to see.
[00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:41.620]   And then I think the thing that, honestly, the thing that got me the most excited was
[00:38:41.620 --> 00:38:47.500]   that third type, like how do you create new stuff that is inspired by and in the voice
[00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:54.980]   of the Daily Show, but not in a 22 minute video format for distribution through a proprietary
[00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:56.420]   cable network.
[00:38:56.420 --> 00:39:03.700]   But instead, how do you make an interactive app or a mockery of the March Madness, in this
[00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:09.140]   case we did a third month mania, or instead of basketball teams, it was issues and people
[00:39:09.140 --> 00:39:15.020]   and who you hated the most, like which made you mad or was it Bill Cosby or Martin Shkreli?
[00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:16.940]   Is it tangled headphones or taco trucks?
[00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:18.860]   Do I have to choose one?
[00:39:18.860 --> 00:39:22.860]   In the end, the people chose and there was this big tournament and it came down to climate
[00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:25.900]   change versus Trump supporters.
[00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:32.220]   And which one do America are Americans the most mad at and in a prescient move, Trump
[00:39:32.220 --> 00:39:35.580]   supporters beat out climate change.
[00:39:35.580 --> 00:39:41.100]   So this is obviously a satirical construct, but there was a technically sound build, like
[00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:44.620]   it was super interactive and lots of jokes in it.
[00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:48.180]   So that's a flavor of what the job was.
[00:39:48.180 --> 00:39:52.380]   And I think if I'll say one last thing off the pedestal because I think people are listening
[00:39:52.380 --> 00:39:59.460]   that this might matter for, it was so much less about what I brought to that show in terms
[00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:03.560]   of like, I came in with 50 ideas and we did 13 of them or something like that.
[00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:09.620]   And I think for me, it was the humbling excitement of being able to unlock what was already there
[00:40:09.620 --> 00:40:13.900]   and just showing people a new way to it's almost like being a language instructor.
[00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:18.740]   And when people can start to like express themselves in a new language, you can once
[00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:23.580]   you can make a joke in another language, like you're really, you get the language.
[00:40:23.580 --> 00:40:29.420]   So once you can make a joke with the internet or a joke with technology or with VR with
[00:40:29.420 --> 00:40:33.420]   various flavors of these things, first of all, you realize like, yo, I'm really funny.
[00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:36.980]   Like I can do this in multiple languages, but not just spoken ones.
[00:40:36.980 --> 00:40:42.340]   And so I think we were able our team to work with folks who are already there, show them
[00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:48.340]   some new things and like collaboratively unlock some more, you know, creative and comedic
[00:40:48.340 --> 00:40:54.380]   potential that didn't necessarily fit in that 22 minute video over a proprietary cable
[00:40:54.380 --> 00:40:55.380]   network package.
[00:40:55.380 --> 00:41:00.740]   It's so funny because of course, tech TV back in '98 when we started, you would think
[00:41:00.740 --> 00:41:03.460]   that'd be the first, you know, channel to really get that.
[00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:05.340]   And it was just as much of a battle.
[00:41:05.340 --> 00:41:07.860]   And I don't know if I ever spoke their language, frankly.
[00:41:07.860 --> 00:41:10.260]   I don't think they learned.
[00:41:10.260 --> 00:41:14.140]   But it's really interesting to watch this evolve over time.
[00:41:14.140 --> 00:41:15.580]   Oh, and it's hard.
[00:41:15.580 --> 00:41:19.540]   I mean, look, you see the people who are just starting always have the advantage.
[00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:23.980]   It's the African nations who go straight to mobile and don't rip up their streets to
[00:41:23.980 --> 00:41:27.860]   put copper in the land, which sounds backwards.
[00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:32.580]   So if you get to start right now in the future is just a second ahead of you, you're going
[00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:33.580]   to be more futuristic.
[00:41:33.580 --> 00:41:41.060]   And if you have to adapt a 20 year operating strategy and maintain all the legacy networks
[00:41:41.060 --> 00:41:45.380]   and personalities and billing systems, it's just it's hard.
[00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:51.140]   And I've been in this position multiple times now with like older media organizations stepping
[00:41:51.140 --> 00:41:52.580]   more aggressively into the future.
[00:41:52.580 --> 00:41:53.940]   And you worked with the onion.
[00:41:53.940 --> 00:41:55.180]   The onion got it, right?
[00:41:55.180 --> 00:41:56.540]   I was there for five years.
[00:41:56.540 --> 00:41:57.540]   Yeah, the onion.
[00:41:57.540 --> 00:41:59.300]   I mean, that was another great job.
[00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:01.220]   One of the best jobs I ever had.
[00:42:01.220 --> 00:42:05.140]   And the onion went pretty blazing into the future, but it wasn't.
[00:42:05.140 --> 00:42:12.340]   I mean, I had a lot of internal conversations, shall we say, to try to justify and explain
[00:42:12.340 --> 00:42:18.380]   and convince and show why this matters, why it's not just some kind of vanity project,
[00:42:18.380 --> 00:42:23.380]   the why it's maintaining relevance and interestingness.
[00:42:23.380 --> 00:42:25.700]   Ultimately, like the world changes we change with it.
[00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:27.860]   That's kind of how things have always been.
[00:42:27.860 --> 00:42:30.460]   It's great to see you again.
[00:42:30.460 --> 00:42:31.460]   I'm just wait to be.
[00:42:31.460 --> 00:42:32.860]   Well, can I say one more thing?
[00:42:32.860 --> 00:42:37.380]   And then I'll be I am on the National Geographic as a correspondent.
[00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:38.380]   Oh, me.
[00:42:38.380 --> 00:42:40.100]   This there's a new show called Explore.
[00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:43.860]   It airs right after their Mars show on Monday nights.
[00:42:43.860 --> 00:42:47.500]   And I am all up in the second episode on November 21st.
[00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:52.300]   So for those who are listening in time to catch it or catch it on on demand tune into
[00:42:52.300 --> 00:42:57.820]   that geo explore where you'll see me doing field pieces and panel discussions and all
[00:42:57.820 --> 00:42:58.820]   kinds of fun stuff.
[00:42:58.820 --> 00:43:01.100]   What is the topic of this episode?
[00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:06.140]   The topic of this episode largely has to deal with criminal justice in America.
[00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:07.140]   Interesting.
[00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:12.260]   So Nat Geo, you know, obviously goes to the bottom of the sea, satellites, ancient pyramids,
[00:43:12.260 --> 00:43:18.020]   but they're taking this explore concept into also social issues and human interest and
[00:43:18.020 --> 00:43:19.020]   whatnot.
[00:43:19.020 --> 00:43:21.420]   So I did a story about policing outside of New Orleans.
[00:43:21.420 --> 00:43:23.820]   There's a story about private prisons.
[00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:29.460]   And there's a really amazing story about honey that I think helps, helps bring, bring
[00:43:29.460 --> 00:43:31.180]   money seekers pursuing you.
[00:43:31.180 --> 00:43:35.500]   Hi, I think that's, I think that's you walking by the Gretna City Hall right there in that
[00:43:35.500 --> 00:43:36.500]   image.
[00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:37.500]   That's me.
[00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:38.500]   That's me walking back.
[00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:40.500]   I'm not getting stopped like Oh, Dr. Mica.
[00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:42.220]   Oh, doctors also here.
[00:43:42.220 --> 00:43:44.700]   Oh, and JJ Stone IQMZ.com.
[00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:48.900]   And of course, lovely to have to have Georgia Dow.
[00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:49.940]   I was going to do Greta Dow.
[00:43:49.940 --> 00:43:52.220]   I don't know why Greta Dow is with us.
[00:43:52.220 --> 00:43:53.980]   You look like you could be a Greta.
[00:43:53.980 --> 00:43:54.980]   I could be a Greta.
[00:43:54.980 --> 00:43:55.980]   Yeah.
[00:43:55.980 --> 00:43:58.020]   We still don't know what your real name is.
[00:43:58.020 --> 00:44:02.140]   Don't say I like having a little mystery.
[00:44:02.140 --> 00:44:03.140]   Don't do it.
[00:44:03.140 --> 00:44:04.140]   Don't do it.
[00:44:04.140 --> 00:44:05.140]   Don't do it.
[00:44:05.140 --> 00:44:06.140]   Two things.
[00:44:06.140 --> 00:44:07.140]   Two things.
[00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:09.220]   Uh, Berritenday is your boy, black Trump still online.
[00:44:09.220 --> 00:44:10.220]   Your boy, black Trump.com.
[00:44:10.220 --> 00:44:11.220]   It is.
[00:44:11.220 --> 00:44:12.220]   It is.
[00:44:12.220 --> 00:44:13.220]   That's my jam.
[00:44:13.220 --> 00:44:14.220]   That's my jam.
[00:44:14.220 --> 00:44:15.220]   Yeah.
[00:44:15.220 --> 00:44:19.180]   And second thing Leo for the love of Jimmy Christmas, I'm a simple in this tea.
[00:44:19.180 --> 00:44:20.180]   Why you do this?
[00:44:20.180 --> 00:44:21.180]   Read man.
[00:44:21.180 --> 00:44:23.180]   Big ass, is that sweet tea?
[00:44:23.180 --> 00:44:25.180]   Because that's going to kill you.
[00:44:25.180 --> 00:44:28.460]   This is lemon tea with all natural flavors by pig.
[00:44:28.460 --> 00:44:29.460]   Don't ask me, no questions.
[00:44:29.460 --> 00:44:30.460]   Get to this.
[00:44:30.460 --> 00:44:31.460]   Okay.
[00:44:31.460 --> 00:44:32.540]   We're going to talk about audible.com.
[00:44:32.540 --> 00:44:33.540]   You know why?
[00:44:33.540 --> 00:44:41.020]   Because audible.com is the best place to listen to Berritenday read, how to be black, right?
[00:44:41.020 --> 00:44:42.740]   Did you ever put that on audible.com?
[00:44:42.740 --> 00:44:43.740]   Yeah.
[00:44:43.740 --> 00:44:44.740]   I read it myself.
[00:44:44.740 --> 00:44:45.740]   That's what I thought.
[00:44:45.740 --> 00:44:46.740]   Yep.
[00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:47.740]   Yep.
[00:44:47.740 --> 00:44:50.900]   In his own voice, ladies and gentlemen, this voice, you can hear it again and again and again.
[00:44:50.900 --> 00:44:53.700]   Just one of many, many.
[00:44:53.700 --> 00:44:56.420]   Oh, look, it's a ray has a book.
[00:44:56.420 --> 00:44:57.420]   Nice.
[00:44:57.420 --> 00:45:01.220]   And a great new HBO show called, I love and secure.
[00:45:01.220 --> 00:45:02.500]   It is wild.
[00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:03.500]   It is wild.
[00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:04.500]   It is so funny.
[00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:06.540]   Anyway, this is the deal.
[00:45:06.540 --> 00:45:09.180]   You get two books at audible.com right now for free.
[00:45:09.180 --> 00:45:15.020]   If you go to audible.com/twit to Trevor Noah's got a new one born a crime stories from the
[00:45:15.020 --> 00:45:18.300]   South African childhood.
[00:45:18.300 --> 00:45:19.300]   Lots of books.
[00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:20.620]   Science fiction.
[00:45:20.620 --> 00:45:26.100]   If you like history, if you like self help, it's endless.
[00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:27.940]   Stephen Levy's amazing hackers.
[00:45:27.940 --> 00:45:32.100]   If you're into technology and you haven't read hackers, now's the time and you can listen
[00:45:32.100 --> 00:45:33.100]   to it for free.
[00:45:33.100 --> 00:45:36.940]   What we're going to do is go to get you two books for free.
[00:45:36.940 --> 00:45:43.060]   You're going to go to audible.com/twit to you'll be signing up for the platinum account.
[00:45:43.060 --> 00:45:45.540]   That's a two book a month account.
[00:45:45.540 --> 00:45:47.220]   Lisa is listening to this one right now.
[00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:51.220]   The subtle art of not giving a fig.
[00:45:51.220 --> 00:45:52.220]   She loves it.
[00:45:52.220 --> 00:45:54.020]   She says, it's a great book.
[00:45:54.020 --> 00:45:56.740]   I still have to work on that a little bit.
[00:45:56.740 --> 00:45:59.380]   The new Rogue One novel catalyst.
[00:45:59.380 --> 00:46:05.460]   If you go to audible.com/twit to you'll be signing up for the two book a month plan,
[00:46:05.460 --> 00:46:06.460]   the platinum plan.
[00:46:06.460 --> 00:46:11.020]   You also get the daily digest of the Wall Street Journal or the New York Times so you can listen
[00:46:11.020 --> 00:46:14.420]   to news as well as great literature and books.
[00:46:14.420 --> 00:46:15.740]   And you get to pick two books.
[00:46:15.740 --> 00:46:17.180]   Now, here's the deal.
[00:46:17.180 --> 00:46:22.180]   If at any time in the first 30 days you say, it's nice but not for me, you can pay nothing,
[00:46:22.180 --> 00:46:23.660]   just cancel and you'll pay nothing.
[00:46:23.660 --> 00:46:25.700]   And you'll get to keep those books forever.
[00:46:25.700 --> 00:46:28.300]   Which is one of the things I like about audible.
[00:46:28.300 --> 00:46:29.300]   It's like a bookshelf.
[00:46:29.300 --> 00:46:31.980]   I've been an Audible member since the year 2000 for 16 years.
[00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:33.140]   Me too.
[00:46:33.140 --> 00:46:34.340]   Have you really been that long?
[00:46:34.340 --> 00:46:35.340]   Yeah.
[00:46:35.340 --> 00:46:40.020]   Back before they were acquired by anybody back when you had this special little dinky MP3
[00:46:40.020 --> 00:46:41.020]   player.
[00:46:41.020 --> 00:46:42.020]   Remember they had the auto OTTO?
[00:46:42.020 --> 00:46:43.020]   Yeah.
[00:46:43.020 --> 00:46:46.660]   No, I loved, I was an original book.
[00:46:46.660 --> 00:46:50.740]   I used to check out books on tape in the public library as a junior high student.
[00:46:50.740 --> 00:46:51.740]   Yes.
[00:46:51.740 --> 00:46:52.740]   Just a long commute to school.
[00:46:52.740 --> 00:46:54.340]   And auto reverse was a big deal.
[00:46:54.340 --> 00:46:55.340]   Yes.
[00:46:55.340 --> 00:46:58.460]   The cassette would play the B side without you have to take it out and flip it over.
[00:46:58.460 --> 00:47:04.260]   So I've been very committed to audio consumption of books and Audible makes that addiction much
[00:47:04.260 --> 00:47:05.260]   easier to service.
[00:47:05.260 --> 00:47:09.620]   It was such a huge thing for me when I didn't have to send the cassettes back after 30 days
[00:47:09.620 --> 00:47:12.980]   because I would never finish a book.
[00:47:12.980 --> 00:47:15.140]   And so Audible, you get to keep it forever.
[00:47:15.140 --> 00:47:16.500]   And you could download it instantly.
[00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:20.140]   So very frequently, I'll say, "Oh, I got to read that and I'll download it."
[00:47:20.140 --> 00:47:21.140]   And I'm listened.
[00:47:21.140 --> 00:47:22.140]   And it's just anyway.
[00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:23.140]   Audible.com/twit2.
[00:47:23.140 --> 00:47:24.940]   Two books for you.
[00:47:24.940 --> 00:47:25.940]   Pick two books.
[00:47:25.940 --> 00:47:26.940]   It's going to be hard.
[00:47:26.940 --> 00:47:28.820]   Here's Robert Scobel's book now.
[00:47:28.820 --> 00:47:30.300]   Is now out on Audible.com.
[00:47:30.300 --> 00:47:33.620]   Age of, no, I think he's got a new one coming.
[00:47:33.620 --> 00:47:34.620]   This is not the new one.
[00:47:34.620 --> 00:47:36.900]   His new one is coming, but it's not out yet.
[00:47:36.900 --> 00:47:42.180]   Tim Wu has a new one called The Attention Merchants, which is a highly, highly recommended book.
[00:47:42.180 --> 00:47:43.180]   I got to read that.
[00:47:43.180 --> 00:47:44.180]   He loved him.
[00:47:44.180 --> 00:47:45.180]   He loved him really good.
[00:47:45.180 --> 00:47:47.180]   He wrote the master switch.
[00:47:47.180 --> 00:47:48.620]   The master switch.
[00:47:48.620 --> 00:47:49.620]   Yeah.
[00:47:49.620 --> 00:47:57.380]   And this one is absolutely timely about the barrage of advertising, branding, sponsored
[00:47:57.380 --> 00:48:01.780]   social media commercials, all attempting to harvest.
[00:48:01.780 --> 00:48:04.740]   The one thing we've got to offer them are attention.
[00:48:04.740 --> 00:48:06.180]   I see what you did there, Leo.
[00:48:06.180 --> 00:48:10.260]   In the middle of an ad, you plugged a book that's critical of ads.
[00:48:10.260 --> 00:48:11.260]   That's nice.
[00:48:11.260 --> 00:48:12.260]   Ha ha ha.
[00:48:12.260 --> 00:48:13.260]   Hey, stop it.
[00:48:13.260 --> 00:48:15.260]   So you're not supposed to call attention to that.
[00:48:15.260 --> 00:48:18.100]   I'm a little subversive sometimes, huh?
[00:48:18.100 --> 00:48:19.340]   Audible.com/twit2.
[00:48:19.340 --> 00:48:20.340]   This isn't an ad.
[00:48:20.340 --> 00:48:24.340]   This is a song of love to Audible.
[00:48:24.340 --> 00:48:26.220]   Really seriously to Audible.com.
[00:48:26.220 --> 00:48:29.180]   And you might want to check out Paul Beatty's newest, The Sellout.
[00:48:29.180 --> 00:48:31.060]   All right.
[00:48:31.060 --> 00:48:32.060]   So there we go.
[00:48:32.060 --> 00:48:33.060]   There we go.
[00:48:33.060 --> 00:48:36.540]   And I'm going to show you what I'm going to do.
[00:48:36.540 --> 00:48:38.540]   I'm going to show you what I'm going to do.
[00:48:38.540 --> 00:48:40.540]   I'm going to show you what I'm going to do.
[00:48:40.540 --> 00:48:41.540]   I'm going to show you what I'm going to do.
[00:48:41.540 --> 00:48:42.540]   I'm going to show you what I'm going to do.
[00:48:42.540 --> 00:48:43.540]   I'm going to show you what I'm going to do.
[00:48:43.540 --> 00:48:44.540]   I'm going to show you what I'm going to do.
[00:48:44.540 --> 00:48:45.540]   I'm going to show you what I'm going to do.
[00:48:45.540 --> 00:48:46.540]   I'm going to show you what I'm going to do.
[00:48:46.540 --> 00:48:47.540]   I'm going to show you what I'm going to do.
[00:48:47.540 --> 00:48:48.540]   I'm going to show you what I'm going to do.
[00:48:48.540 --> 00:48:49.540]   I'm going to show you what I'm going to do.
[00:48:49.540 --> 00:48:50.540]   I'm going to show you what I'm going to do.
[00:48:50.540 --> 00:48:51.540]   I'm going to show you what I'm going to do.
[00:48:51.540 --> 00:48:58.540]   I'm going to show you what I'm going to do.
[00:48:58.540 --> 00:49:01.540]   I'm going to show you what I'm going to do.
[00:49:01.540 --> 00:49:04.540]   I'm going to show you what I'm going to do.
[00:49:04.540 --> 00:49:05.540]   I'm going to show you what I'm going to do.
[00:49:05.540 --> 00:49:06.540]   I'm going to show you what I'm going to do.
[00:49:06.540 --> 00:49:07.540]   I'm going to show you what I'm going to do.
[00:49:07.540 --> 00:49:08.540]   I'm going to show you what I'm going to do.
[00:49:08.540 --> 00:49:09.540]   I'm going to show you what I'm going to do.
[00:49:09.540 --> 00:49:10.540]   I'm going to show you what I'm going to do.
[00:49:10.540 --> 00:49:11.540]   I'm going to show you what I'm going to do.
[00:49:11.540 --> 00:49:12.540]   I'm going to show you what I'm going to do.
[00:49:12.540 --> 00:49:13.540]   I'm going to show you what I'm going to do.
[00:49:13.540 --> 00:49:14.540]   I'm going to show you what I'm going to do.
[00:49:14.540 --> 00:49:15.540]   I'm going to show you what I'm going to do.
[00:49:15.540 --> 00:49:20.540]   I'm going to show you what I'm going to do.
[00:49:20.540 --> 00:49:25.540]   I'm going to show you what I'm going to do.
[00:49:25.540 --> 00:49:26.540]   I'm going to show you what I'm going to do.
[00:49:26.540 --> 00:49:27.540]   I'm going to show you what I'm going to do.
[00:49:27.540 --> 00:49:28.540]   I'm going to show you what I'm going to do.
[00:49:28.540 --> 00:49:29.540]   I'm going to show you what I'm going to do.
[00:49:29.540 --> 00:49:30.540]   I'm going to show you what I'm going to do.
[00:49:30.540 --> 00:49:31.540]   I'm going to show you what I'm going to do.
[00:49:31.540 --> 00:49:32.540]   I'm going to show you what I'm going to do.
[00:49:32.540 --> 00:49:33.540]   I'm going to show you what I'm going to do.
[00:49:33.540 --> 00:49:34.540]   I'm going to show you what I'm going to do.
[00:49:34.540 --> 00:49:35.540]   I'm going to show you what I'm going to do.
[00:49:35.540 --> 00:49:36.540]   I'm going to show you what I'm going to do.
[00:49:36.540 --> 00:49:37.540]   I'm going to show you what I'm going to do.
[00:49:37.540 --> 00:49:44.540]   I'm going to show you what I'm going to do.
[00:49:44.540 --> 00:49:51.540]   I'm going to show you what I'm going to do.
[00:49:51.540 --> 00:49:58.540]   I'm going to show you what I'm going to do.
[00:49:58.540 --> 00:50:05.540]   I'm going to show you what I'm going to do.
[00:50:05.540 --> 00:50:09.540]   He says, "We hear from recyclers all the time who have fires from lithium ion batteries.
[00:50:09.540 --> 00:50:14.540]   They're either left in by accident or we didn't find it."
[00:50:14.540 --> 00:50:18.540]   When they grind it up, of course, as with any lithium ion battery, it explodes and bursts
[00:50:18.540 --> 00:50:19.540]   into flame.
[00:50:19.540 --> 00:50:23.540]   It's a real problem for recyclers to the point where this is going in the landfill.
[00:50:23.540 --> 00:50:25.540]   This is not going to be recycled.
[00:50:25.540 --> 00:50:32.540]   Apple, I remember years ago, apple getting heavily criticized for burning down the earth
[00:50:32.540 --> 00:50:35.540]   and being bad citizens of the world.
[00:50:35.540 --> 00:50:39.540]   They came back and they're like, "Oh, no, but we do this and our new building is going
[00:50:39.540 --> 00:50:40.540]   to be lead certified.
[00:50:40.540 --> 00:50:41.540]   It's a spaceship.
[00:50:41.540 --> 00:50:42.540]   It can take us to Mars.
[00:50:42.540 --> 00:50:44.540]   It's the earth that will melt down."
[00:50:44.540 --> 00:50:46.540]   I remember that press conference.
[00:50:46.540 --> 00:50:48.540]   They're a member of EP.
[00:50:48.540 --> 00:50:50.540]   Their stuff is EP certified.
[00:50:50.540 --> 00:50:56.540]   I have to think it has a little bit to do with the millions of dollars they gave EP more
[00:50:56.540 --> 00:50:58.540]   than the sustainability of the electronics.
[00:50:58.540 --> 00:51:00.540]   Here's what I'm going to propose.
[00:51:00.540 --> 00:51:03.100]   By the way, it's not just Apple.
[00:51:03.100 --> 00:51:04.100]   It's everybody.
[00:51:04.100 --> 00:51:05.100]   This is the Google Pixel.
[00:51:05.100 --> 00:51:06.020]   Sealed battery.
[00:51:06.020 --> 00:51:07.020]   Right?
[00:51:07.020 --> 00:51:11.300]   Now, it may be possible to take it apart and take the battery out easily, I don't know.
[00:51:11.300 --> 00:51:17.340]   But I think increasingly the drive towards thinner electronics is driving us towards sealed
[00:51:17.340 --> 00:51:18.340]   cases and batteries.
[00:51:18.340 --> 00:51:22.620]   Remember the days when you could take the back of a phone and replace the battery or pop
[00:51:22.620 --> 00:51:25.660]   the battery out of a laptop and put a new one in?
[00:51:25.660 --> 00:51:30.420]   The battery goes bad in a few years anyway.
[00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:33.780]   They're essentially making disposable electronics.
[00:51:33.780 --> 00:51:36.500]   This is an awful big chunk of disposable electronics.
[00:51:36.500 --> 00:51:39.500]   Are you sure that Liam can't take the battery out?
[00:51:39.500 --> 00:51:41.700]   Liam cannot take the battery out.
[00:51:41.700 --> 00:51:43.740]   By the way, so I asked that.
[00:51:43.740 --> 00:51:46.180]   And Liam has a very particular set of skills.
[00:51:46.180 --> 00:51:47.180]   Yes, he does.
[00:51:47.180 --> 00:51:48.420]   It's like an iPhone.
[00:51:48.420 --> 00:51:49.420]   He was meant for it.
[00:51:49.420 --> 00:51:53.700]   Liam is not ready for Westworld yet.
[00:51:53.700 --> 00:51:57.420]   I asked Kyle, "Doesn't Apple recycle these?"
[00:51:57.420 --> 00:51:59.860]   Because you're supposed to bring your old stuff back to Apple.
[00:51:59.860 --> 00:52:03.460]   He said, "I know the recycler that Apple uses."
[00:52:03.460 --> 00:52:04.460]   And no.
[00:52:04.460 --> 00:52:05.460]   Wow.
[00:52:05.460 --> 00:52:06.460]   And so here's the issue.
[00:52:06.460 --> 00:52:08.100]   That's a crime.
[00:52:08.100 --> 00:52:10.500]   Going forward, I think we as consumers.
[00:52:10.500 --> 00:52:14.900]   For our own benefit because replaceable batteries are good for us, it keeps the electronics lasting
[00:52:14.900 --> 00:52:15.900]   longer.
[00:52:15.900 --> 00:52:18.460]   If you have a cell phone with a replaceable battery, you couldn't put a second battery
[00:52:18.460 --> 00:52:19.460]   in.
[00:52:19.460 --> 00:52:21.260]   And it's good for the environment.
[00:52:21.260 --> 00:52:28.660]   Shouldn't we start demanding, not thinner and lighter, but removable batteries and recycling?
[00:52:28.660 --> 00:52:30.900]   First of all, I'll go ahead.
[00:52:30.900 --> 00:52:31.900]   Oh, Dr. Niske.
[00:52:31.900 --> 00:52:32.900]   Oh, Dr. Niske.
[00:52:32.900 --> 00:52:35.580]   First of all, I hate this new laptop.
[00:52:35.580 --> 00:52:38.780]   I hate this new direction that Apple is going into.
[00:52:38.780 --> 00:52:42.980]   They're not going into the Pro series when people used to create content.
[00:52:42.980 --> 00:52:45.580]   Now they want to do a Pro series for you to consume content.
[00:52:45.580 --> 00:52:48.340]   Yeah, this is basically an iPad with a keyboard.
[00:52:48.340 --> 00:52:50.140]   Can you just repeat that?
[00:52:50.140 --> 00:52:51.140]   Oh, Dr. Niske.
[00:52:51.140 --> 00:52:52.140]   I want to take these people to the church.
[00:52:52.140 --> 00:52:53.380]   Can you repeat that?
[00:52:53.380 --> 00:52:55.980]   Preach, oh, Dr. Niske.
[00:52:55.980 --> 00:53:00.620]   So first of all, let me just, I'm just going and then I'm going to stop.
[00:53:00.620 --> 00:53:04.420]   You make a laptop with only C ports in it and then you put a headphone jack in it.
[00:53:04.420 --> 00:53:07.700]   After you just told me that you were magically getting rid of my headphone jack that I tried
[00:53:07.700 --> 00:53:10.180]   to put into this iPhone 7 Plus repeatedly.
[00:53:10.180 --> 00:53:11.300]   Now why is it in that?
[00:53:11.300 --> 00:53:14.940]   And you can't have a way for me to just plug my phone into my laptop and charge it when
[00:53:14.940 --> 00:53:16.940]   I'm on the go and I got stuff to do.
[00:53:16.940 --> 00:53:20.060]   And instead now I have to pull out this dongle and look like a doofus.
[00:53:20.060 --> 00:53:23.420]   But you couldn't put an SD card reader in it because you told me aerodynamics.
[00:53:23.420 --> 00:53:26.060]   I'm thinking this dongle is aerodynamic.
[00:53:26.060 --> 00:53:27.060]   Everything is wrong with this thing.
[00:53:27.060 --> 00:53:30.300]   You told me, have you just seen it with a little scroll bar?
[00:53:30.300 --> 00:53:31.300]   No, no, I'm not done.
[00:53:31.300 --> 00:53:33.820]   You just didn't get it with a stupid little scroll bar.
[00:53:33.820 --> 00:53:38.180]   I got any professional knows how to use the function keys to get around any of these
[00:53:38.180 --> 00:53:40.060]   pro tools that they're using.
[00:53:40.060 --> 00:53:42.020]   It's so insane and things that they're doing.
[00:53:42.020 --> 00:53:43.420]   I never miss Steve Jobs.
[00:53:43.420 --> 00:53:45.420]   I thought to myself, he's a man I never met.
[00:53:45.420 --> 00:53:46.420]   I don't need him.
[00:53:46.420 --> 00:53:51.420]   But I miss him so much because it's so ridiculous the stupid stuff they're doing.
[00:53:51.420 --> 00:53:56.020]   And if you wanted my grandma to have a MacBook Pro to maybe you shouldn't charge $3,000 for
[00:53:56.020 --> 00:53:57.540]   you stupid doofus.
[00:53:57.540 --> 00:53:58.540]   I don't need it.
[00:53:58.540 --> 00:54:01.820]   And it makes me so much I need new computer and I'm happy to go back to Microsoft because
[00:54:01.820 --> 00:54:03.300]   they're the only ones I can do.
[00:54:03.300 --> 00:54:04.300]   Can I tell you something?
[00:54:04.300 --> 00:54:08.420]   Did you see that sexy 28 inch tablet that you put down and screw that in right off with
[00:54:08.420 --> 00:54:09.420]   Apple's innovation?
[00:54:09.420 --> 00:54:10.420]   Y'all ain't got no magic.
[00:54:10.420 --> 00:54:11.420]   Y'all ain't got no courage.
[00:54:11.420 --> 00:54:14.580]   I'm gonna stop yelling because people get mad because they yell on the show.
[00:54:14.580 --> 00:54:16.940]   But I hate it so much and it makes me so sad.
[00:54:16.940 --> 00:54:17.940]   You know that?
[00:54:17.940 --> 00:54:22.420]   Please Leo, Leo, just we need a moment.
[00:54:22.420 --> 00:54:29.020]   We just need a moment of silence to appreciate the Bill Cosby mixed with Homer Simpson.
[00:54:29.020 --> 00:54:32.060]   Rant and we just heard.
[00:54:32.060 --> 00:54:33.060]   Oh my God.
[00:54:33.060 --> 00:54:36.180]   It was that was the most beautiful thing I've heard on this show in years.
[00:54:36.180 --> 00:54:39.540]   Oh, doctor, I want to find you and hug you, but I know you're in a non disclosed black
[00:54:39.540 --> 00:54:40.540]   site.
[00:54:40.540 --> 00:54:41.540]   I'll bring it back to you.
[00:54:41.540 --> 00:54:42.540]   It's all I have to say.
[00:54:42.540 --> 00:54:44.540]   I don't want to find you.
[00:54:44.540 --> 00:54:45.540]   That was amazing.
[00:54:45.540 --> 00:54:46.540]   Dude.
[00:54:46.540 --> 00:54:47.540]   It hurt my heart.
[00:54:47.540 --> 00:54:51.140]   I need to spend three G's on the laptop and I can't bring myself to do it.
[00:54:51.140 --> 00:54:55.500]   I need one and I can't do it right now because I'm so upset and I don't want to go back
[00:54:55.500 --> 00:54:56.500]   to Microsoft.
[00:54:56.500 --> 00:55:00.300]   I dumped her a long time ago, but now she I look at sexy to put on a cute dress and
[00:55:00.300 --> 00:55:01.860]   lost 50 pounds.
[00:55:01.860 --> 00:55:09.340]   I have no words.
[00:55:09.340 --> 00:55:10.340]   Sorry.
[00:55:10.340 --> 00:55:11.340]   Georgia.
[00:55:11.340 --> 00:55:12.340]   Georgia.
[00:55:12.340 --> 00:55:13.340]   What do you think about Georgia?
[00:55:13.340 --> 00:55:15.940]   Well, Georgia writes for I'm or which is an Apple.
[00:55:15.940 --> 00:55:16.940]   I do.
[00:55:16.940 --> 00:55:18.100]   And I think Renee's watching the show.
[00:55:18.100 --> 00:55:19.820]   So I have to be really careful what I say.
[00:55:19.820 --> 00:55:23.780]   If I still want to have a job after this, I'm not getting it.
[00:55:23.780 --> 00:55:24.780]   I'm not getting it.
[00:55:24.780 --> 00:55:25.780]   I'm not getting it.
[00:55:25.780 --> 00:55:26.780]   I like my ports.
[00:55:26.780 --> 00:55:28.540]   I don't like doing that.
[00:55:28.540 --> 00:55:29.780]   It's really clear to me.
[00:55:29.780 --> 00:55:33.540]   Apple has become a fashion brand, not a technology brand.
[00:55:33.540 --> 00:55:35.340]   And I like fashion.
[00:55:35.340 --> 00:55:36.340]   I like fashion.
[00:55:36.340 --> 00:55:37.340]   No, I do fashion.
[00:55:37.340 --> 00:55:40.100]   And just like fashion, it's but gorgeous.
[00:55:40.100 --> 00:55:42.500]   Yes, it's form, not function.
[00:55:42.500 --> 00:55:43.500]   Beautiful.
[00:55:43.500 --> 00:55:44.500]   Yes.
[00:55:44.500 --> 00:55:48.540]   It's got the power of like, you know, a calculator.
[00:55:48.540 --> 00:55:50.180]   Real computers are ugly.
[00:55:50.180 --> 00:55:51.180]   This is an ugly.
[00:55:51.180 --> 00:55:52.180]   This is a real computer.
[00:55:52.180 --> 00:55:53.180]   It's ugly.
[00:55:53.180 --> 00:55:54.180]   I like to do both.
[00:55:54.180 --> 00:55:55.180]   I like to do both.
[00:55:55.180 --> 00:55:58.260]   They can be beautiful and I can still have my ports.
[00:55:58.260 --> 00:56:00.620]   There is no reason you had to get rid of them.
[00:56:00.620 --> 00:56:02.980]   And then you give me the three millimole.
[00:56:02.980 --> 00:56:05.540]   I'm absolutely with Owen on that.
[00:56:05.540 --> 00:56:06.540]   I do.
[00:56:06.540 --> 00:56:08.140]   I like the touch bar.
[00:56:08.140 --> 00:56:09.540]   I want it to be a touch screen.
[00:56:09.540 --> 00:56:11.460]   And yeah, I look at Microsoft.
[00:56:11.460 --> 00:56:12.460]   That's a touch screen.
[00:56:12.460 --> 00:56:13.460]   It looks good.
[00:56:13.460 --> 00:56:14.460]   It's good.
[00:56:14.460 --> 00:56:15.460]   It's good.
[00:56:15.460 --> 00:56:16.460]   It's really sexy.
[00:56:16.460 --> 00:56:17.460]   It ain't got a touch screen yet.
[00:56:17.460 --> 00:56:19.220]   And then they come out with a $300 book.
[00:56:19.220 --> 00:56:22.300]   I'm going to take this frickin' out pause and go into a store and just dump it all
[00:56:22.300 --> 00:56:23.300]   over.
[00:56:23.300 --> 00:56:24.300]   God, don't do that.
[00:56:24.300 --> 00:56:25.300]   No, don't do that.
[00:56:25.300 --> 00:56:26.300]   No, come on.
[00:56:26.300 --> 00:56:27.300]   You like hearing me.
[00:56:27.300 --> 00:56:28.300]   You're dark looking now.
[00:56:28.300 --> 00:56:30.500]   They're not going to get that money.
[00:56:30.500 --> 00:56:32.900]   A $300 coffee book with Apple stuff in it.
[00:56:32.900 --> 00:56:33.900]   Oh, yeah.
[00:56:33.900 --> 00:56:34.900]   There you go.
[00:56:34.900 --> 00:56:35.900]   How about that?
[00:56:35.900 --> 00:56:36.900]   A $300 book.
[00:56:36.900 --> 00:56:37.900]   You deals are costless books.
[00:56:37.900 --> 00:56:39.900]   I didn't buy that book.
[00:56:39.900 --> 00:56:40.900]   I didn't buy that book.
[00:56:40.900 --> 00:56:41.900]   Here's what I got.
[00:56:41.900 --> 00:56:42.900]   So that's your gift.
[00:56:42.900 --> 00:56:43.900]   Fill them up with the holidays.
[00:56:43.900 --> 00:56:44.900]   That's why.
[00:56:44.900 --> 00:56:45.900]   No.
[00:56:45.900 --> 00:56:46.900]   You're not buying people.
[00:56:46.900 --> 00:56:49.660]   We might be missing with Apple.
[00:56:49.660 --> 00:56:57.500]   They take the removable battery away only so that in three years they can unveil a brand
[00:56:57.500 --> 00:56:59.700]   new, removable battery.
[00:56:59.700 --> 00:57:02.260]   And it's a pretty bad guy.
[00:57:02.260 --> 00:57:05.700]   It's the first removable battery.
[00:57:05.700 --> 00:57:07.740]   It's the number before scene.
[00:57:07.740 --> 00:57:08.740]   No one's ever done.
[00:57:08.740 --> 00:57:14.460]   It's like when they introduced copy and paste to a modern computing platform known as the
[00:57:14.460 --> 00:57:18.460]   iPhone, six months to 12 months after it was released.
[00:57:18.460 --> 00:57:25.420]   I'm still stuck honestly on the wastefulness of it all where they want you to throw this
[00:57:25.420 --> 00:57:31.020]   away where you can't take it for repairs where it's got to be, it's going to explode
[00:57:31.020 --> 00:57:32.020]   if you take it to a recycling.
[00:57:32.020 --> 00:57:34.740]   They probably refer most of them.
[00:57:34.740 --> 00:57:35.740]   The book is a different thing.
[00:57:35.740 --> 00:57:37.980]   The book is just, you know.
[00:57:37.980 --> 00:57:41.460]   It's just for them to, to their own advertised.
[00:57:41.460 --> 00:57:42.460]   300 dollars.
[00:57:42.460 --> 00:57:45.260]   You're selling it on advertising and people will buy it.
[00:57:45.260 --> 00:57:46.260]   There's a non-existent AirPods.
[00:57:46.260 --> 00:57:49.180]   I'm so happy I have a gift for Nate.
[00:57:49.180 --> 00:57:50.420]   He's hard to buy for us.
[00:57:50.420 --> 00:57:52.340]   Yeah, Nate will want this.
[00:57:52.340 --> 00:57:54.340]   So one second.
[00:57:54.340 --> 00:57:59.020]   The thing we always have to remember too about recycling is to be fair, Apple computers
[00:57:59.020 --> 00:58:02.500]   get the best shelf life known to man.
[00:58:02.500 --> 00:58:07.060]   You people have laptops for three, four years still throw them a boy e-bank in a G form
[00:58:07.060 --> 00:58:08.060]   and they still roll.
[00:58:08.060 --> 00:58:11.820]   Like I noticed chicks, she's still rocking with one of those old white Mac books.
[00:58:11.820 --> 00:58:16.980]   And I'm like, is this something like, it's like from 2005 and she still uses it.
[00:58:16.980 --> 00:58:23.700]   Apple does make a better quality product that lasts longer than a disposable Windows
[00:58:23.700 --> 00:58:24.700]   machine.
[00:58:24.700 --> 00:58:25.700]   I'll give them that.
[00:58:25.700 --> 00:58:31.100]   But now that they're making super sized iPhones, I don't know if that's going to be true anymore.
[00:58:31.100 --> 00:58:35.180]   I mean, this is a, this is a weird shift and it doesn't have the creative power like you
[00:58:35.180 --> 00:58:36.180]   said yourself.
[00:58:36.180 --> 00:58:40.420]   I'm, look, I'm honestly thinking and this is not a commitment, but it is a public exploration.
[00:58:40.420 --> 00:58:42.980]   Like I've been in this Apple ecosystem for a long time.
[00:58:42.980 --> 00:58:44.780]   I used to build my own PCs.
[00:58:44.780 --> 00:58:47.220]   I used to try to play with Linux on the side.
[00:58:47.220 --> 00:58:50.820]   And then I just got suckered because Apple made it easy and I was like, I can do other
[00:58:50.820 --> 00:58:52.380]   things with my time.
[00:58:52.380 --> 00:58:58.860]   But I feel a loss of freedom and self and I'm just not, I'm not trying to have that.
[00:58:58.860 --> 00:59:03.580]   So I'm really considering doing the PC thing just to diversify my interface.
[00:59:03.580 --> 00:59:08.060]   Every once in a while, I'll switch my mail app, my calendar app, just to change the interface.
[00:59:08.060 --> 00:59:12.420]   So I don't get too hooked on what somebody thinks I should see the world as.
[00:59:12.420 --> 00:59:16.620]   And Apple has gotten me like deep into their world with Apple TV and iTunes and everything
[00:59:16.620 --> 00:59:17.620]   else.
[00:59:17.620 --> 00:59:22.140]   And this laptop, I'm probably not going to get it, but it's like another little symbol.
[00:59:22.140 --> 00:59:26.580]   Like why would I give them everything and at least spread pieces of me around?
[00:59:26.580 --> 00:59:30.340]   Like if you're going to exploit me, I'm going to make it as hard as I can and still, I know
[00:59:30.340 --> 00:59:32.220]   have a life that functions in the modern world.
[00:59:32.220 --> 00:59:33.220]   Here's Colbert.
[00:59:33.220 --> 00:59:34.220]   That's smart.
[00:59:34.220 --> 00:59:35.220]   That's smart.
[00:59:35.220 --> 00:59:36.220]   You play, you play hard to get.
[00:59:36.220 --> 00:59:37.220]   This is the new Apple book.
[00:59:37.220 --> 00:59:38.220]   That's Apple.
[00:59:38.220 --> 00:59:39.220]   We've always strived for innovation.
[00:59:39.220 --> 00:59:46.140]   There was the iBook, the MacBook, and now the most advanced book we've ever made.
[00:59:46.140 --> 00:59:48.140]   The Apple Book.
[00:59:48.140 --> 00:59:55.900]   It's 450 pages of high resolution images of Apple products you probably already have
[00:59:55.900 --> 00:59:56.900]   in your basement.
[00:59:56.900 --> 01:00:04.100]   Using the latest and most innovative technology from 1440, we were able to take an experience
[01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:09.700]   who was instantly familiar and charge $300 for it.
[01:00:09.700 --> 01:00:17.220]   Its touch page technology allows you to simply swipe your finger on a page, turn it.
[01:00:17.220 --> 01:00:21.900]   We also wanted to make a completely intuitive experience.
[01:00:21.900 --> 01:00:24.900]   So the Apple Book's pages are sequential.
[01:00:24.900 --> 01:00:31.460]   16 is followed by 61, which is followed by 62, followed by 63.
[01:00:31.460 --> 01:00:33.900]   Why is it Apple is so easily parodied now?
[01:00:33.900 --> 01:00:36.900]   Is that a sign of a company that is not?
[01:00:36.900 --> 01:00:40.660]   When you decide the truth, take yourself too seriously.
[01:00:40.660 --> 01:00:43.780]   The true sign is that audience thinks that that book is fake.
[01:00:43.780 --> 01:00:44.780]   Right.
[01:00:44.780 --> 01:00:46.900]   The audience thinks that that book is the joke and it's real.
[01:00:46.900 --> 01:00:47.900]   It's not.
[01:00:47.900 --> 01:00:48.900]   It's real.
[01:00:48.900 --> 01:00:49.900]   It's real.
[01:00:49.900 --> 01:00:52.060]   I think they become a fashion company.
[01:00:52.060 --> 01:00:55.380]   I think somebody somewhere said, "You know where the profits are?
[01:00:55.380 --> 01:00:56.780]   Is it the high end?
[01:00:56.780 --> 01:01:01.500]   We make high end products because the PC is dying and we don't know what the hell to do
[01:01:01.500 --> 01:01:02.500]   with it."
[01:01:02.500 --> 01:01:07.140]   Who's going to make the stuff that the people consume?
[01:01:07.140 --> 01:01:10.860]   They're literally making consumption machines, but people need to produce them.
[01:01:10.860 --> 01:01:11.860]   It's not their job.
[01:01:11.860 --> 01:01:13.260]   SnapChat will make that, oh, doctor.
[01:01:13.260 --> 01:01:14.260]   They'll be glad.
[01:01:14.260 --> 01:01:15.260]   The glasses.
[01:01:15.260 --> 01:01:16.260]   You go get them.
[01:01:16.260 --> 01:01:17.260]   Go to Big Sur.
[01:01:17.260 --> 01:01:18.260]   Hey, can we talk about SnapChat?
[01:01:18.260 --> 01:01:19.260]   No, yeah.
[01:01:19.260 --> 01:01:20.700]   Let's take a break and we'll talk about SnapChat.
[01:01:20.700 --> 01:01:21.700]   How about that?
[01:01:21.700 --> 01:01:22.700]   Oh, my God.
[01:01:22.700 --> 01:01:23.700]   I'm so happy.
[01:01:23.700 --> 01:01:24.700]   That's so, doctor.
[01:01:24.700 --> 01:01:25.700]   Oh, and JJ Stone.
[01:01:25.700 --> 01:01:27.540]   Love having you on the show and love the rants, my friend.
[01:01:27.540 --> 01:01:28.540]   What was it?
[01:01:28.540 --> 01:01:29.540]   What was it?
[01:01:29.540 --> 01:01:30.540]   What was it?
[01:01:30.540 --> 01:01:31.540]   What was it?
[01:01:31.540 --> 01:01:32.540]   What was it?
[01:01:32.540 --> 01:01:33.540]   What was it?
[01:01:33.540 --> 01:01:34.540]   Peritunde, the Simpsons.
[01:01:34.540 --> 01:01:37.740]   I feel like there was a heavy Bill Cosby, but there was a little bit of Homer Simpson.
[01:01:37.740 --> 01:01:41.540]   There was a little "why you little" like there was that going on.
[01:01:41.540 --> 01:01:47.020]   And then I mean, there was like a... there was a get off my lawnness to it.
[01:01:47.020 --> 01:01:48.860]   There was like a back of my day.
[01:01:48.860 --> 01:01:53.660]   We used to have an Iceman with a carriage, with a carotid chisel.
[01:01:53.660 --> 01:01:56.500]   And now the ice just comes out of my freezer magically.
[01:01:56.500 --> 01:01:58.100]   I don't trust this ice.
[01:01:58.100 --> 01:01:59.780]   Why can't I get ice the old-fashioned way?
[01:01:59.780 --> 01:02:04.500]   Like it was an 80% on point, but there was like 13% I'm like, I think you're probably
[01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:05.940]   wrong, but I'm just going to go with you.
[01:02:05.940 --> 01:02:08.500]   Yeah, when I make up stuff that sounds good though, right?
[01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:09.500]   Yeah, no hard number.
[01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:10.500]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:11.500]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:12.500]   Everybody else around me is saying it wrong.
[01:02:12.500 --> 01:02:15.340]   83% and 92% of the stuff I say is 100% legit.
[01:02:15.340 --> 01:02:16.340]   Yeah.
[01:02:16.340 --> 01:02:17.340]   Yeah.
[01:02:17.340 --> 01:02:23.620]   Also, I'll also hear the fabulous Georgia Dow.
[01:02:23.620 --> 01:02:29.140]   And her videos now, I bet, have you noticed a big increase in sales of the anxiety videos?
[01:02:29.140 --> 01:02:32.220]   Are they just... they're going through the roof now, right?
[01:02:32.220 --> 01:02:33.980]   Unfortunately, yes.
[01:02:33.980 --> 01:02:36.380]   And I guess fortunately, yes.
[01:02:36.380 --> 01:02:40.060]   It's kind of a comment, isn't it?
[01:02:40.060 --> 01:02:41.060]   So if...
[01:02:41.060 --> 01:02:42.060]   Yeah.
[01:02:42.060 --> 01:02:46.820]   Georgia is besides being one of the nicest people in the world and a writer for I'm more
[01:02:46.820 --> 01:02:53.060]   is also a psychotherapist and you and your partner have a website anxiety-videos.com
[01:02:53.060 --> 01:02:58.500]   where you can get lots of stuff to help you sleep better, help you relax, help you get
[01:02:58.500 --> 01:02:59.500]   rid of the anxiety.
[01:02:59.500 --> 01:03:01.180]   Anxiety is a problem in this modern.
[01:03:01.180 --> 01:03:02.180]   Anxiety, yeah.
[01:03:02.180 --> 01:03:06.220]   We just did one on depression as well, especially at this time of year.
[01:03:06.220 --> 01:03:12.300]   There's a lot of seasonal, effective disorder that's coming around or post-election depression.
[01:03:12.300 --> 01:03:16.860]   Like it's just people are really shocked for many different reason, holidays, family.
[01:03:16.860 --> 01:03:18.220]   It's a little bit of a rough time of year.
[01:03:18.220 --> 01:03:19.220]   You're lucky.
[01:03:19.220 --> 01:03:20.220]   You guys...
[01:03:20.220 --> 01:03:21.220]   You're welcome.
[01:03:21.220 --> 01:03:22.220]   Dead.
[01:03:22.220 --> 01:03:23.220]   Yeah.
[01:03:23.220 --> 01:03:24.220]   Right.
[01:03:24.220 --> 01:03:25.220]   It's true.
[01:03:25.220 --> 01:03:26.220]   Westworld.
[01:03:26.220 --> 01:03:27.220]   There's stressful stuff happening.
[01:03:27.220 --> 01:03:28.220]   You guys are lucky in Canada that you had Thanksgiving in October.
[01:03:28.220 --> 01:03:29.220]   That was smart to have it before the US election.
[01:03:29.220 --> 01:03:30.220]   Yes.
[01:03:30.220 --> 01:03:33.620]   We are going to have to suffer all of us through Thanksgiving.
[01:03:33.620 --> 01:03:39.220]   Some of us will be with loved ones who hate us.
[01:03:39.220 --> 01:03:41.300]   Did you see the 19 questions?
[01:03:41.300 --> 01:03:48.980]   The New York Times suggested that you prepare for your Thanksgiving dialogue.
[01:03:48.980 --> 01:03:58.100]   19 questions you should ask the people that you are sitting with to ask the loved ones
[01:03:58.100 --> 01:03:59.580]   for Thanksgiving.
[01:03:59.580 --> 01:04:03.860]   I think we should ask all those questions at the various bots that are available online
[01:04:03.860 --> 01:04:05.380]   and see how well they do with it.
[01:04:05.380 --> 01:04:06.380]   Did you see it, Georgia?
[01:04:06.380 --> 01:04:07.380]   No.
[01:04:07.380 --> 01:04:11.020]   I think we should ask the loved ones who voted the other way.
[01:04:11.020 --> 01:04:15.580]   Is this supposed to be to have a good Thanksgiving or to have a good bad Thanksgiving?
[01:04:15.580 --> 01:04:16.580]   Yeah.
[01:04:16.580 --> 01:04:17.740]   Well, it's very psychotherapeutic, right?
[01:04:17.740 --> 01:04:24.140]   So you sit down, do it over a meal or drink, offer the benefit of the doubt, assume the
[01:04:24.140 --> 01:04:26.380]   other person has generally good intentions.
[01:04:26.380 --> 01:04:27.380]   Almost everyone does.
[01:04:27.380 --> 01:04:31.220]   Don't let imperfect word choices tank the conversation.
[01:04:31.220 --> 01:04:32.220]   Forget policy debates.
[01:04:32.220 --> 01:04:35.660]   Then say, describe your relationship to me.
[01:04:35.660 --> 01:04:36.660]   Are we close?
[01:04:36.660 --> 01:04:37.660]   Okay.
[01:04:37.660 --> 01:04:39.380]   I'll just say it too soon.
[01:04:39.380 --> 01:04:40.380]   Don't do this.
[01:04:40.380 --> 01:04:41.380]   Don't do this.
[01:04:41.380 --> 01:04:43.580]   Anybody I vote for and why?
[01:04:43.580 --> 01:04:46.460]   What was the most important issue for me?
[01:04:46.460 --> 01:04:48.140]   Why do you feel differently about that issue?
[01:04:48.140 --> 01:04:49.740]   How do you think our views came to be so different?
[01:04:49.740 --> 01:04:52.260]   Has it been difficult to talk to me about this election?
[01:04:52.260 --> 01:04:54.100]   If so, why?
[01:04:54.100 --> 01:04:57.380]   Can I say something to my very psycho bad person?
[01:04:57.380 --> 01:04:58.380]   Yeah.
[01:04:58.380 --> 01:05:01.280]   I was at the grocery store the other day and it was like super packed because everybody was
[01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:02.780]   Thanksgiving and stuff.
[01:05:02.780 --> 01:05:06.860]   And I was talking to this nice older lady, we're talking about hams, and this gentleman
[01:05:06.860 --> 01:05:08.640]   bumped into her cart.
[01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:11.580]   And she pulled her cart back and the guy didn't say excuse me.
[01:05:11.580 --> 01:05:15.660]   And for some reason of my heart I just wanted to yell Trump America right in the face like,
[01:05:15.660 --> 01:05:19.560]   oh no, no, no, no, no, no, it came with my mind like Trump.
[01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:20.560]   I know.
[01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:22.220]   Trump is the new Tourette's.
[01:05:22.220 --> 01:05:23.220]   Don't do it.
[01:05:23.220 --> 01:05:24.220]   Don't do it.
[01:05:24.220 --> 01:05:25.220]   Don't do it.
[01:05:25.220 --> 01:05:26.220]   I want to do it.
[01:05:26.220 --> 01:05:27.220]   I'm sad in my heart.
[01:05:27.220 --> 01:05:28.220]   What is wrong with me?
[01:05:28.220 --> 01:05:29.220]   Why am I?
[01:05:29.220 --> 01:05:30.520]   Why do I want to do that?
[01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:32.520]   You need to get a Twitter account, Owen.
[01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:34.860]   No, you need to talk after the show.
[01:05:34.860 --> 01:05:35.860]   No, you can't.
[01:05:35.860 --> 01:05:36.860]   Don't do that.
[01:05:36.860 --> 01:05:41.000]   People, what happens to people when they're, they have a, any subject that they are really
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:45.340]   strong and passionate about is that, you know, the limbic part of your brain, like the lizard
[01:05:45.340 --> 01:05:48.420]   part of your brain takes over and it shuts off your working memory.
[01:05:48.420 --> 01:05:50.380]   So there is not much you're working with.
[01:05:50.380 --> 01:05:51.380]   No.
[01:05:51.380 --> 01:05:52.380]   Don't do that.
[01:05:52.380 --> 01:05:55.640]   You want to enjoy your turkey and all of the gravy and goodness.
[01:05:55.640 --> 01:05:58.000]   You don't want to have a fork flying across the table.
[01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000]   Don't become part of the lizard people, Owen.
[01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000]   So, so, so, John, you're here.
[01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:03.000]   Don't ask these questions.
[01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:10.220]   Could you like as a service as a, as a, as a generous Canadian service as a name, as an
[01:06:10.220 --> 01:06:12.140]   act of neighborliness?
[01:06:12.140 --> 01:06:16.780]   Could you reframe those 19 New York Times questions into something that won't get people
[01:06:16.780 --> 01:06:17.780]   stabbed into the fork?
[01:06:17.780 --> 01:06:18.780]   I got one.
[01:06:18.780 --> 01:06:19.780]   I got one.
[01:06:19.780 --> 01:06:20.780]   Thanks.
[01:06:20.780 --> 01:06:21.780]   I got one.
[01:06:21.780 --> 01:06:22.780]   What do you think of the weather?
[01:06:22.780 --> 01:06:23.780]   How's it?
[01:06:23.780 --> 01:06:24.780]   It's beautiful day.
[01:06:24.780 --> 01:06:25.780]   Isn't it?
[01:06:25.780 --> 01:06:26.780]   How's that turkey for you?
[01:06:26.780 --> 01:06:27.780]   A little dry?
[01:06:27.780 --> 01:06:28.780]   Good.
[01:06:28.780 --> 01:06:29.780]   You like it?
[01:06:29.780 --> 01:06:31.100]   >> [LAUGH]
[01:06:31.100 --> 01:06:32.020]   >> Really?
[01:06:32.020 --> 01:06:32.840]   >> Grass dirt leg men, yes.
[01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:33.840]   >> Yeah.
[01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:36.180]   >> Anything, anything else than anything else.
[01:06:36.180 --> 01:06:36.700]   >> Anything else?
[01:06:36.700 --> 01:06:42.420]   >> You really, this is just people, people are up in arms on both sides of the fence that
[01:06:42.420 --> 01:06:45.700]   you don't need to make your family members more upset or upset.
[01:06:45.700 --> 01:06:46.620]   It's too soon.
[01:06:46.620 --> 01:06:47.620]   Don't do it.
[01:06:47.620 --> 01:06:48.620]   >> This is probing the bad tooth of your tongue.
[01:06:48.620 --> 01:06:50.240]   This is not a good idea.
[01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:53.260]   >> So maybe- >> This is great for people that are moderately-
[01:06:53.260 --> 01:06:54.880]   >> This is great for the people that are moderately glistening.
[01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:55.880]   >> Yeah, same if it's right.
[01:06:55.880 --> 01:06:57.780]   >> But wait until people feel more-
[01:06:57.780 --> 01:07:00.620]   >> I agree with you.
[01:07:00.620 --> 01:07:02.540]   >> Don't do that, people are really-
[01:07:02.540 --> 01:07:06.940]   >> By the way, the last two questions, what do you think we agree on and
[01:07:06.940 --> 01:07:10.020]   the last question is actually so sad.
[01:07:10.020 --> 01:07:11.180]   Do you still like me?
[01:07:11.180 --> 01:07:12.580]   >> [LAUGH]
[01:07:12.580 --> 01:07:14.740]   >> Sir, thank you, your times.
[01:07:14.740 --> 01:07:18.300]   >> This is mob mentality, you should never ask a large group questions like that cuz
[01:07:18.300 --> 01:07:19.940]   they could turn on you at any second.
[01:07:19.940 --> 01:07:21.740]   >> No, we never like you.
[01:07:21.740 --> 01:07:23.740]   >> We never like conversations on the internet that you ask.
[01:07:23.740 --> 01:07:26.300]   You call your mom on the phone, you don't go face to face.
[01:07:26.300 --> 01:07:27.340]   >> Always hate to do.
[01:07:27.340 --> 01:07:29.020]   >> I'm going to touch it.
[01:07:29.020 --> 01:07:32.620]   >> Let's take a break, we're going to talk about something else that you probably
[01:07:32.620 --> 01:07:36.180]   don't want to do around this time of year and that's go to the post office.
[01:07:36.180 --> 01:07:39.340]   The holidays are coming, they call that at the post office amateur hour.
[01:07:39.340 --> 01:07:44.860]   If you use the postal service for business, maybe you sell on Etsy or
[01:07:44.860 --> 01:07:49.100]   eBay or Amazon or maybe you send out bills or invoices or brochures.
[01:07:49.100 --> 01:07:52.020]   If you're doing business in the post office, you don't want to go to the post
[01:07:52.020 --> 01:07:55.700]   office when all the non-business users are there tying up the post office.
[01:07:55.700 --> 01:07:59.380]   Traffic, parking, it's going to be packed, everybody mailing holiday gifts.
[01:07:59.380 --> 01:08:04.420]   But the truth is year round, you can save time, save money,
[01:08:04.420 --> 01:08:07.220]   save anxiety by using stamps.com.
[01:08:07.220 --> 01:08:14.060]   Stamps.com online lets you buy and print official US postage from your computer,
[01:08:14.060 --> 01:08:17.180]   your printer, it's not a postage meter, you can use what you've already got.
[01:08:17.180 --> 01:08:22.980]   In fact, they will send you for free a digital scale worth 50 bucks so
[01:08:22.980 --> 01:08:26.500]   that you can weigh every package and have exactly the right postage.
[01:08:26.500 --> 01:08:29.380]   You can print the postage right on the envelope or you can print a label for
[01:08:29.380 --> 01:08:32.100]   a box, any kind of mailing.
[01:08:32.100 --> 01:08:33.260]   Any kind of mailing.
[01:08:33.260 --> 01:08:36.740]   You can print on plain paper and envelope, they have stamps.com labels that let you
[01:08:36.740 --> 01:08:39.660]   print actually print stamps.
[01:08:39.660 --> 01:08:43.660]   You can have your company logo on it, the return address is automatically filled
[01:08:43.660 --> 01:08:44.660]   and it's cray-cray.
[01:08:44.660 --> 01:08:45.660]   It's all true.
[01:08:45.660 --> 01:08:47.860]   Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, there's more.
[01:08:47.860 --> 01:08:52.780]   If you go to stamps.com right now and click the microphone in the upper

[01:08:58.740 --> 01:09:03.700]   you will get $55 in coupons for free postage.
[01:09:03.700 --> 01:09:04.700]   What?
[01:09:04.700 --> 01:09:05.700]   Free money.
[01:09:05.700 --> 01:09:06.700]   Free money.
[01:09:06.700 --> 01:09:10.780]   And because they do charge you for shipping of the scales, five bucks, they'll give you
[01:09:10.780 --> 01:09:13.460]   a $5 supply kit and of course a month free of stamps.com.
[01:09:13.460 --> 01:09:19.020]   So it all works out to about $110 value and I'm telling you it is the most professional
[01:09:19.020 --> 01:09:20.020]   way.
[01:09:20.020 --> 01:09:21.020]   You want to look professional.
[01:09:21.020 --> 01:09:25.260]   Maybe on Etsy you don't mind having a brown paper package wrapped with twine and about
[01:09:25.260 --> 01:09:31.980]   100 Amelia Earhart stamps on it but most of us would like to look a little more professional
[01:09:31.980 --> 01:09:33.060]   and this is what it'll do.
[01:09:33.060 --> 01:09:34.420]   Plus it'll save you time.
[01:09:34.420 --> 01:09:39.580]   It even fills out the forms for certified mail and customs forms for overseas mail
[01:09:39.580 --> 01:09:40.580]   stuff like that.
[01:09:40.580 --> 01:09:42.060]   It's so great.
[01:09:42.060 --> 01:09:45.300]   And then the mail carrier comes to you and picks it up.
[01:09:45.300 --> 01:09:46.380]   You can have a nice conversation.
[01:09:46.380 --> 01:09:48.380]   You can ask the mail carrier, do you like me?
[01:09:48.380 --> 01:09:49.380]   Stamps.
[01:09:49.380 --> 01:09:50.740]   Mail more stuff.
[01:09:50.740 --> 01:09:53.180]   That does stamps.com.
[01:09:53.180 --> 01:09:55.660]   Use the offer code TWIT TWIT TWIT.
[01:09:55.660 --> 01:09:56.660]   It does make you want mail more stuff.
[01:09:56.660 --> 01:10:02.620]   Next time you're tempted to post a picture on Instagram, I ship out mail it mail it to
[01:10:02.620 --> 01:10:04.660]   all your followers.
[01:10:04.660 --> 01:10:05.660]   Mail it first and you'll know.
[01:10:05.660 --> 01:10:07.580]   I bought this in Canada.
[01:10:07.580 --> 01:10:09.220]   Yeah, but it's not stamps.
[01:10:09.220 --> 01:10:10.220]   Somebody else.
[01:10:10.220 --> 01:10:11.220]   And mail it back.
[01:10:11.220 --> 01:10:18.640]   I thought I bought letterpress cards that said from the desk of the chief twit and I bought
[01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:20.240]   like envelopes and fountain pens.
[01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:23.880]   I thought I would just hand write answers to people.
[01:10:23.880 --> 01:10:25.500]   And then I wrote something in my handwritten letter.
[01:10:25.500 --> 01:10:28.300]   I wrote one and my hand ached so bad.
[01:10:28.300 --> 01:10:32.420]   I haven't done any since.
[01:10:32.420 --> 01:10:34.420]   I can't write anymore.
[01:10:34.420 --> 01:10:35.420]   You owe me a letter.
[01:10:35.420 --> 01:10:38.020]   I owe you a very nice thank you.
[01:10:38.020 --> 01:10:42.960]   You know, you know, you know, if you get one to Owen, I want a letter as well.
[01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:46.800]   See now you're doubling up and I'm not going to get mine, but Lisa sent one in this place.
[01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:47.800]   I know the handwriting.
[01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:48.800]   I saw it.
[01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:49.800]   Did you do that?
[01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:54.060]   Yeah, she said she said we want she took care of it, but you still didn't do your job.
[01:10:54.060 --> 01:10:55.060]   That's good woman.
[01:10:55.060 --> 01:10:56.060]   You got you.
[01:10:56.060 --> 01:10:57.060]   That's not my fault.
[01:10:57.060 --> 01:10:58.060]   I'm a lefty.
[01:10:58.060 --> 01:10:59.060]   Yeah.
[01:10:59.060 --> 01:11:01.660]   So she snapchat snapchat.
[01:11:01.660 --> 01:11:04.020]   Oh snapchat, baby.
[01:11:04.020 --> 01:11:06.700]   Snap not snapchat IPO.
[01:11:06.700 --> 01:11:09.140]   They found this is the new thing.
[01:11:09.140 --> 01:11:12.300]   If you're not worth a certain amount, I can't I don't know what the deal is according to
[01:11:12.300 --> 01:11:13.300]   the jobs.
[01:11:13.300 --> 01:11:17.740]   Yeah, there's some deal where you don't have to file publicly anymore for an IPO.
[01:11:17.740 --> 01:11:24.320]   So snap, which is the name, the corporate name now of snapchat is filed secretly for
[01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:31.920]   an IPO, which we expect will be about $25 billion according to the Wall Street Journal.
[01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:35.240]   That's already interesting because IPO stands for initial public.
[01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:38.200]   Yeah, I know, but you can file it.
[01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:39.200]   Okay.
[01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:40.200]   Yeah, it's weird.
[01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:44.400]   I don't I'm I don't understand all this stuff, but I'm sure somebody could explain
[01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:46.920]   why this is a good thing.
[01:11:46.920 --> 01:11:50.040]   At some point you have to get public because you have to sell the darn thing, but I guess
[01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:51.240]   they don't want to maybe not.
[01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:52.440]   Maybe they'll be secretly public.
[01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:56.880]   Yeah, maybe they'll change the whole game, the whole IPO game and their stock will just
[01:11:56.880 --> 01:12:00.280]   disappear after 10 minutes as soon as you own it, you won't own anymore.
[01:12:00.280 --> 01:12:02.120]   There you go.
[01:12:02.120 --> 01:12:10.400]   So 25 billion with a B, $1 and that wouldn't even be the full valuation of the company.
[01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:11.560]   And what is snapchat?
[01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:12.760]   It's an app.
[01:12:12.760 --> 01:12:14.000]   Right?
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:15.840]   Is there anything more than the app?
[01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:18.120]   Snapchat is a way of life, Leo.
[01:12:18.120 --> 01:12:19.560]   It's a it's a new.
[01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:20.560]   You snap.
[01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:24.480]   It's you know, you people have talked about virtual reality, augmented reality.
[01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:29.040]   Snapchat's just reality and it's a it's a window on reality reality.
[01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:30.560]   It's whimsical.
[01:12:30.560 --> 01:12:35.440]   Can I put it on a Coke bottle and it's attention basically it's taking people's attention and
[01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:36.800]   that's worth a lot of money.
[01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:37.960]   So that's why it's worth all that.
[01:12:37.960 --> 01:12:40.480]   Is it really do you think worth that much?
[01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:48.560]   I'm not a numbers finance IPO person, but I suppose so.
[01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:54.200]   I mean, look, if someone believes enough that they can get that money back by selling washing
[01:12:54.200 --> 01:13:00.880]   machines as filters or whatever is going to come next golf clubs attached to your earlobes,
[01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:04.880]   maybe that'll be the thing that really puts it over the top and makes it worthwhile.
[01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:10.000]   Whatever's grabbing these many minutes of people's time of day, people assume is worth something,
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:11.160]   whether they can get that money back.
[01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:12.840]   We'll see that I'm not so sure.
[01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:19.480]   I don't know if they should be able to, honestly, but it does the size doesn't shock me given
[01:13:19.480 --> 01:13:23.400]   how obsessive the use is and just how fun the thing is.
[01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:28.000]   It's not it's kind of like a game and a social environment.
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:33.120]   Oh, and do you snap?
[01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:35.080]   I have snaps.
[01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:37.320]   I look at other people's snaps.
[01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:38.800]   I do not snap.
[01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:42.920]   I want to see you and if you've ever used a filter, I want some photos on Twitter.
[01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:43.920]   I don't look.
[01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:44.920]   Here's the thing.
[01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:45.920]   Here's the thing.
[01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:47.480]   No Snapchat ain't worth this money.
[01:13:47.480 --> 01:13:49.280]   No Snapchat ain't never going to make this money.
[01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:50.880]   They ain't never going to get this money back.
[01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:54.560]   And I think, I know, I understand the marketing because you Snapchat had to get it.
[01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:57.320]   I understand the demographic is like 13 and 19.
[01:13:57.320 --> 01:14:00.200]   What money do they got to buy the stuff that you're trying to sell?
[01:14:00.200 --> 01:14:03.480]   Do you think you're going to advertise to a 13 year old that don't even cut grass because
[01:14:03.480 --> 01:14:07.440]   he's Snapchat and all day and got no time to have no real job because he's a lazy millennial
[01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:08.440]   or whatever the generation is.
[01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:09.440]   It's not a 30 year old.
[01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:11.040]   Why do they go do so so much money?
[01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:12.840]   Yes, there's a lot of people looking at me and his money back.
[01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:13.840]   They don't make no money.
[01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:14.840]   They don't make no money.
[01:14:14.840 --> 01:14:18.480]   They're selling the those spectacles are like they're not even selling them.
[01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:19.920]   They're where's Waldo on them.
[01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:20.920]   They're sticking them out in the forest.
[01:14:20.920 --> 01:14:22.320]   You go get 15 of them.
[01:14:22.320 --> 01:14:23.320]   People tweet about that.
[01:14:23.320 --> 01:14:24.320]   I got to get some big deal.
[01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:25.920]   Well, that's this is that's good marketing.
[01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:26.920]   That's brilliant, right?
[01:14:26.920 --> 01:14:27.920]   Oh, it's great marketing.
[01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:28.920]   That part of it amazing.
[01:14:28.920 --> 01:14:29.920]   Here it is.
[01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:36.440]   Here it is by the this is the blue whale of Katusa, which is one of the attractions at
[01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:37.440]   Route 66.
[01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:39.200]   No, no, isn't that?
[01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:43.480]   That's kind of maybe that's a little backhanded snap at the Twitter.
[01:14:43.480 --> 01:14:48.280]   It's apparently an attraction on Route 66 in Oklahoma, the blue whale of Katusa.
[01:14:48.280 --> 01:14:53.440]   And that next to it, that thing with the balloons is the vending machine for spectacle.
[01:14:53.440 --> 01:14:58.160]   So what you got to do is you got to follow spectacles on Twitter and wait for something
[01:14:58.160 --> 01:14:59.720]   like this.
[01:14:59.720 --> 01:15:01.640]   And then you go, oh, and you run.
[01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:04.840]   This was 5 a.m. on the 15th couple of days ago.
[01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:08.480]   And you run to the blue whale of Katusa.
[01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:12.080]   Like Pokemon go with real stuff.
[01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:13.680]   Yeah.
[01:15:13.680 --> 01:15:16.560]   You know, I can see how they might make money.
[01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:17.560]   I think you're right, Baratundi.
[01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:20.400]   They could make money, but the filters, right?
[01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:22.200]   Well, not just filters.
[01:15:22.200 --> 01:15:24.040]   They're like a TV network.
[01:15:24.040 --> 01:15:26.520]   And so they can insert video ads into that stream.
[01:15:26.520 --> 01:15:27.520]   I mean, it's very traditional.
[01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:31.280]   Did you daily show strategy involves Snapchat?
[01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:32.280]   It did.
[01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:33.280]   It did.
[01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:34.680]   My personal strategy involves snap at tuned.
[01:15:34.680 --> 01:15:35.680]   That's my.
[01:15:35.680 --> 01:15:37.480]   Oh, I follow snap at tuned.
[01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:40.960]   I'm going to be you were doing stories for a while.
[01:15:40.960 --> 01:15:42.280]   Do you still do those?
[01:15:42.280 --> 01:15:46.320]   I haven't done a story in about a week.
[01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:47.320]   I don't know.
[01:15:47.320 --> 01:15:48.320]   Something happened a week ago that distracted me.
[01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:49.320]   I can't quite remember what it was.
[01:15:49.320 --> 01:15:51.760]   So that's when you got to do stories, man.
[01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:54.800]   But yeah, I'll be back on it, especially with my travels.
[01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:58.360]   I have done a lot of snap stories.
[01:15:58.360 --> 01:15:59.600]   But George, I feel like I cut you off.
[01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:01.880]   Are you about to say something about the the snapster?
[01:16:01.880 --> 01:16:04.160]   No, I was just, I was just saying.
[01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:05.160]   I like the filters.
[01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:06.160]   I'm not on Snapchat.
[01:16:06.160 --> 01:16:11.520]   I just, I just use the filters and then I screenshot the picture of me with the filter.
[01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:12.520]   I'll use it.
[01:16:12.520 --> 01:16:13.520]   Or it's horrible.
[01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:16.800]   I like the opposite of Owen.
[01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:21.440]   I'm like, emojuing and like having all the pictures with the filters.
[01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:22.440]   And I do not.
[01:16:22.440 --> 01:16:26.600]   There might be a butterfly around my head picture somewhere out the entity.
[01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:28.440]   I ain't going to put it out there in the water.
[01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:32.480]   There may or may not be me sipping on a my tie somewhere on a fake beach.
[01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:35.400]   I understand Snapchat because people in the chat are young.
[01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:37.520]   I understand the power of understand users of it.
[01:16:37.520 --> 01:16:43.240]   I just think the inflation and the hype on this product is not worth the money that they're
[01:16:43.240 --> 01:16:45.040]   trying to get when they go public.
[01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:48.400]   Regular suckers that don't know anything about anything are going to go dump their money
[01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:49.400]   in these investments.
[01:16:49.400 --> 01:16:50.400]   That's always the case.
[01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:51.400]   And then they don't.
[01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:52.400]   That's why you're doing this.
[01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:53.400]   Right?
[01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:54.400]   Yes.
[01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:55.400]   They're saying it's worth as many billions.
[01:16:55.400 --> 01:16:59.160]   So that when it comes down to like 900 million, you're like, this is a deal.
[01:16:59.160 --> 01:17:00.160]   Let's jump in.
[01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:01.160]   Yeah.
[01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:05.920]   But the thing is everybody lives in kind of it's got this kind of almost casino mentality
[01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:08.080]   like or lottery ticket mentality.
[01:17:08.080 --> 01:17:12.960]   Well, if I could just get that big score and no one knows what the next big thing is going
[01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:13.960]   to be.
[01:17:13.960 --> 01:17:15.360]   It's probably I got to be honest.
[01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:18.240]   It's probably not going to be Snapchat or Uber.
[01:17:18.240 --> 01:17:19.920]   You have to have a product.
[01:17:19.920 --> 01:17:23.680]   You have to have a product and Uber at least Uber has something that they sell to people.
[01:17:23.680 --> 01:17:26.040]   If Snapchat was already selling these filters and making it.
[01:17:26.040 --> 01:17:29.840]   They do they sell the filters like they have filters, you know, Warcraft filters and filters
[01:17:29.840 --> 01:17:30.840]   for movies.
[01:17:30.840 --> 01:17:32.080]   I don't I don't know how much money they're making.
[01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:33.920]   They're a private secret open IPO.
[01:17:33.920 --> 01:17:35.280]   I don't know that they're making money.
[01:17:35.280 --> 01:17:36.520]   I don't know that right now.
[01:17:36.520 --> 01:17:38.320]   So in my mind, they're not making any money.
[01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:39.320]   I doubt they're making money.
[01:17:39.320 --> 01:17:41.320]   I doubt they're making money.
[01:17:41.320 --> 01:17:42.320]   Uber at least.
[01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:43.320]   Uber's got a plan.
[01:17:43.320 --> 01:17:44.320]   Hey, we we build our backs.
[01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:47.400]   So people we run out the taxi industry, then we dump all those people in the street and
[01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:49.360]   buy autonomous cars and rake into cash.
[01:17:49.360 --> 01:17:50.360]   At least I get that.
[01:17:50.360 --> 01:17:51.360]   Uber's.
[01:17:51.360 --> 01:17:52.360]   That's a plan.
[01:17:52.360 --> 01:17:54.520]   Exploit everybody as fast as possible.
[01:17:54.520 --> 01:17:55.520]   Exactly.
[01:17:55.520 --> 01:17:56.920]   That's that that makes money.
[01:17:56.920 --> 01:17:57.920]   I put money in that.
[01:17:57.920 --> 01:18:02.200]   I can say I put money in Tesla because they make things, you know, but all the all these
[01:18:02.200 --> 01:18:04.200]   fake look at these Twitter stocks now.
[01:18:04.200 --> 01:18:06.000]   How's Twitter working out for you?
[01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:07.840]   Anybody rich yet?
[01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:10.360]   You can't do this on Twitter.
[01:18:10.360 --> 01:18:18.280]   Are you snapping over the shoulder shot, do you?
[01:18:18.280 --> 01:18:21.080]   Man, this is really great for the listeners.
[01:18:21.080 --> 01:18:22.560]   You know what?
[01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:25.280]   All that to do is imagine the doing some filters.
[01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:28.280]   I saw a snapchat.
[01:18:28.280 --> 01:18:34.200]   I actually I saw I was at a conference with about a week ago and I saw someone walking
[01:18:34.200 --> 01:18:37.680]   around with a crown of flowers on her head like this.
[01:18:37.680 --> 01:18:40.720]   I was like, Oh my God, Snapchat filters are in real life now.
[01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:42.720]   This is IRL Snapchat.
[01:18:42.720 --> 01:18:44.920]   And I was braced to see some over the dog tongue.
[01:18:44.920 --> 01:18:48.920]   You've never been to a hippie convention.
[01:18:48.920 --> 01:18:51.360]   That's like from the six parents and it was a spitting image.
[01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:52.800]   No, it wasn't from hippie.
[01:18:52.800 --> 01:18:54.040]   Snapchat invented the flower crown.
[01:18:54.040 --> 01:18:56.640]   No, and I don't know where you've learned your history.
[01:18:56.640 --> 01:19:00.320]   Okay, when Snapchat started it and everybody's trying to be like Snapchat.
[01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:02.040]   That's how this works.
[01:19:02.040 --> 01:19:03.040]   I don't see any spots.
[01:19:03.040 --> 01:19:05.040]   I'm looking for sponsored ones on here right now.
[01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:06.880]   I'm just waiting for instance to snap to start.
[01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:07.880]   Give me some filters.
[01:19:07.880 --> 01:19:09.040]   Then I'll be happy.
[01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:10.440]   I'm all gammed out.
[01:19:10.440 --> 01:19:11.440]   I want a gram.
[01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:15.320]   But a baritone when you did your stories, you didn't use these filters.
[01:19:15.320 --> 01:19:19.240]   You just you took videos and pictures and you maybe you do a little text illustration.
[01:19:19.240 --> 01:19:25.680]   I use the filters sometimes more for effect, but not so much with the crowns and things
[01:19:25.680 --> 01:19:26.680]   on my own face.
[01:19:26.680 --> 01:19:30.440]   I wasn't doing funny voices and like animal faces and things like that.
[01:19:30.440 --> 01:19:35.200]   I've much preferred to just put weird things next to each other or try to tell an actual
[01:19:35.200 --> 01:19:38.440]   story and do ride alongs and point of view.
[01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:40.680]   Most of the time the camera is not actually on my face.
[01:19:40.680 --> 01:19:44.320]   It's on the world because I happen to think the world is still interesting.
[01:19:44.320 --> 01:19:45.320]   Yeah.
[01:19:45.320 --> 01:19:49.200]   And so I tried to share my view of it rather than just people can just look at my profile
[01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:51.800]   pictures in my face.
[01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:56.080]   So I think I will show them what I'm actually seeing often more interesting.
[01:19:56.080 --> 01:20:00.800]   That's when I knew Hillary Clinton was going to lose actually is when I saw the.
[01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:04.640]   I wish I told people because I forgot to tell people I could have warned you.
[01:20:04.640 --> 01:20:07.600]   Wait a wait a be helpful.
[01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:09.640]   When did you know?
[01:20:09.640 --> 01:20:16.360]   She was at a rally and was standing there kind of foreign Lornley.
[01:20:16.360 --> 01:20:18.560]   I thought waving at people.
[01:20:18.560 --> 01:20:22.960]   Here's the picture and nobody is looking at her.
[01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:29.960]   Every single person has their back to her taking a selfie of them in front of her.
[01:20:29.960 --> 01:20:34.880]   That's when I thought this country this country does not deserve.
[01:20:34.880 --> 01:20:36.120]   We just it's over.
[01:20:36.120 --> 01:20:39.360]   It's just over.
[01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:41.200]   What's up, Jordan?
[01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:46.520]   I just wanted to see you just you're just talking about like that like the society has
[01:20:46.520 --> 01:20:47.520]   lost.
[01:20:47.520 --> 01:20:48.520]   Yes.
[01:20:48.520 --> 01:20:49.520]   Everyone's taking.
[01:20:49.520 --> 01:20:50.520]   They're so busy taking a picture.
[01:20:50.520 --> 01:20:58.160]   It has nothing to do with a candidate or anything.
[01:20:58.160 --> 01:20:59.160]   And of course the Guardian.
[01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:00.160]   I love this.
[01:21:00.160 --> 01:21:04.360]   Jonathan Joe says those taking selfies with Hillary aren't narcissists, but our best hope.
[01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:08.840]   That's when I knew it was this is our best hope.
[01:21:08.840 --> 01:21:09.840]   I don't know.
[01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:10.840]   Tell me.
[01:21:10.840 --> 01:21:13.280]   What does this tell you about humanity?
[01:21:13.280 --> 01:21:16.480]   Leo, this is the age of the memes.
[01:21:16.480 --> 01:21:18.720]   And the meme king won the presidency.
[01:21:18.720 --> 01:21:21.000]   The president elect is the meme king.
[01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:22.080]   And that is what we want.
[01:21:22.080 --> 01:21:23.080]   We don't want.
[01:21:23.080 --> 01:21:24.840]   By the way, I don't want truth.
[01:21:24.840 --> 01:21:32.000]   I'm thrilled to see him tweeting again because life is so much more interesting with an unfiltered
[01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.560]   president elect Donald J. Trump.
[01:21:34.560 --> 01:21:36.040]   I just can't.
[01:21:36.040 --> 01:21:37.040]   You do.
[01:21:37.040 --> 01:21:40.640]   Oh, you become in articulate.
[01:21:40.640 --> 01:21:44.200]   Oh, and yeah, I thought the first because I just get so mad.
[01:21:44.200 --> 01:21:48.680]   The first thing I said after he won and he gave his little punk speech and he was congratulatory.
[01:21:48.680 --> 01:21:50.340]   I said, you know what?
[01:21:50.340 --> 01:21:51.880]   Just just don't tweet anymore.
[01:21:51.880 --> 01:21:53.560]   Whatever else you got to do.
[01:21:53.560 --> 01:21:54.560]   Sweet.
[01:21:54.560 --> 01:21:55.560]   And he stopped for a while.
[01:21:55.560 --> 01:21:56.560]   I was like, Oh, you heard me.
[01:21:56.560 --> 01:21:57.560]   You saw my tweet.
[01:21:57.560 --> 01:21:59.960]   That's that's really when I was encouraged.
[01:21:59.960 --> 01:22:07.560]   And I'm like, I think I think this un this is interesting because it's unmediated.
[01:22:07.560 --> 01:22:13.040]   We've never had this kind of unmediated direct access to the most powerful person in the
[01:22:13.040 --> 01:22:14.040]   world.
[01:22:14.040 --> 01:22:16.040]   I think it's fascinating.
[01:22:16.040 --> 01:22:18.560]   Yeah, most of the other ones were busy thinking.
[01:22:18.560 --> 01:22:20.360]   I'm not going to say that.
[01:22:20.360 --> 01:22:22.120]   I'm just saying it's really interesting.
[01:22:22.120 --> 01:22:24.600]   I don't know what it means, but the world.
[01:22:24.600 --> 01:22:30.440]   It's like he's he's been really accurate in describing where the public is.
[01:22:30.440 --> 01:22:34.960]   He was obviously very good at tapping into where enough of the public was to win the
[01:22:34.960 --> 01:22:36.440]   election.
[01:22:36.440 --> 01:22:40.680]   And he's like the next stage in the evolution of media.
[01:22:40.680 --> 01:22:41.680]   Yes.
[01:22:41.680 --> 01:22:45.320]   He used to have big networks and eight keepers and only a few people had a voice.
[01:22:45.320 --> 01:22:46.400]   Then we get radio.
[01:22:46.400 --> 01:22:47.400]   We get cable.
[01:22:47.400 --> 01:22:52.200]   We get all kinds of other modes of media that basically give more people the power to speak.
[01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:56.520]   And as we do that, our attention span gets shorter and shorter and shorter.
[01:22:56.520 --> 01:23:01.760]   So we we have to get more and more stimulus in order to pay any kind of attention.
[01:23:01.760 --> 01:23:04.600]   And he knows that we have infinite channels now because of the internet.
[01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:06.440]   We have Reddit and then subreddits.
[01:23:06.440 --> 01:23:07.720]   We have all this stuff.
[01:23:07.720 --> 01:23:12.040]   And he is like a walking talking animated GIF of noise.
[01:23:12.040 --> 01:23:17.920]   He is basically like I described him as a as a denial of service attack because he floods
[01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:23.880]   the system with so much that you can't actually respond like in legitimate requests get blocked
[01:23:23.880 --> 01:23:28.760]   because he keeps he's talking about Hamilton and how they attacked his vice president,
[01:23:28.760 --> 01:23:29.760]   how it's unfair.
[01:23:29.760 --> 01:23:30.760]   It's really interesting.
[01:23:30.760 --> 01:23:32.400]   You know, they used to call Reagan the test.
[01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:33.400]   Good at it.
[01:23:33.400 --> 01:23:35.000]   The Teflon president because nothing stuck to him.
[01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:38.240]   But this really takes it to a whole nother level.
[01:23:38.240 --> 01:23:39.240]   He is.
[01:23:39.240 --> 01:23:40.240]   The opposite.
[01:23:40.240 --> 01:23:44.880]   It's he spews so much that you actually don't know what he's saying and you can't
[01:23:44.880 --> 01:23:46.560]   dodge this one.
[01:23:46.560 --> 01:23:48.200]   Should I react to this one?
[01:23:48.200 --> 01:23:49.200]   Is this legitimate?
[01:23:49.200 --> 01:23:53.440]   I should engage with this idea or is this just to shift my attention away from the university
[01:23:53.440 --> 01:23:54.440]   law?
[01:23:54.440 --> 01:23:59.680]   I think a lot of this voters love this that it's driving people crazy, right?
[01:23:59.680 --> 01:24:00.680]   They love that.
[01:24:00.680 --> 01:24:03.080]   But our media prime does for us.
[01:24:03.080 --> 01:24:08.960]   It's bad journalism because the fact that this man could subvert bad news about himself
[01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:13.080]   with a tweet or two about a safe space when he spent two years telling everybody that
[01:24:13.080 --> 01:24:16.880]   the miracle of ponks is magical and powerful in itself.
[01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:18.880]   The journalism isn't doing their job.
[01:24:18.880 --> 01:24:21.240]   No, I don't think they're trying really hard.
[01:24:21.240 --> 01:24:22.240]   I don't think it matters.
[01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:24.520]   They are literally I don't think it matters.
[01:24:24.520 --> 01:24:26.520]   They're really doing their job.
[01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:29.840]   They're because they make because the media business rewards.
[01:24:29.840 --> 01:24:30.840]   True.
[01:24:30.840 --> 01:24:31.840]   Well, and the click.
[01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:37.760]   But I think there is a larger there is a larger interesting story beyond just this, which is
[01:24:37.760 --> 01:24:42.360]   that because we live in a 24 hour news cycle and the rise of the news channels, there is
[01:24:42.360 --> 01:24:49.040]   a constant inundation of bad news and crisis news just and there it's in their interest
[01:24:49.040 --> 01:24:52.000]   to do that right to continually do that.
[01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:55.640]   I have to tell my mom who's 83.
[01:24:55.640 --> 01:24:56.640]   She watches CNN.
[01:24:56.640 --> 01:25:00.720]   I have to say stop it because you're get what you see.
[01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:04.640]   For her, everything is burning down all the time.
[01:25:04.640 --> 01:25:07.200]   Yeah, of course, that's all it shows.
[01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:08.200]   We've tried good news.
[01:25:08.200 --> 01:25:12.000]   Nobody wants good news.
[01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:18.640]   We live in a media environment and this is why I hate Twitter because I think Twitter's
[01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:24.680]   the epitome of this of just this constant barrage of factoids.
[01:25:24.680 --> 01:25:29.680]   The whole fake news thing to me is a meaningless argument because fake news wouldn't work
[01:25:29.680 --> 01:25:33.200]   if people didn't want to believe it and didn't want to spread it.
[01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:39.240]   We live in an environment where there is no truth because it's all it's not just Mr.
[01:25:39.240 --> 01:25:40.240]   Trump.
[01:25:40.240 --> 01:25:43.480]   It's everybody spewing all the time and that's the environment we live in.
[01:25:43.480 --> 01:25:45.200]   I'm spewing right now.
[01:25:45.200 --> 01:25:49.240]   At some point I feel like I just want to turn off social media and can I can I can I be
[01:25:49.240 --> 01:25:54.880]   fair for our audience and just something I tweeted earlier about Trump University.
[01:25:54.880 --> 01:25:59.080]   To be honest, Trump, you was not a scam and the end the students learned what Donald Trump
[01:25:59.080 --> 01:26:00.600]   does and how he makes his money.
[01:26:00.600 --> 01:26:02.960]   Step one, sign up for something stupid.
[01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:05.840]   Step two, claim that that stupid thing is in your fault.
[01:26:05.840 --> 01:26:10.520]   Step three, cry to the public or sue the stupid thing that you agreed to do.
[01:26:10.520 --> 01:26:13.120]   Step five, get paid 20 times your original investment.
[01:26:13.120 --> 01:26:16.240]   Step six, start your own stupid business with that cash you got.
[01:26:16.240 --> 01:26:18.080]   Step seven, fail at that two.
[01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:19.880]   Trump University is legit and viable.
[01:26:19.880 --> 01:26:21.600]   They learned something from Mr. Trump.
[01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:22.600]   By the way, that's what's-
[01:26:22.600 --> 01:26:26.000]   Every one of these, there are millions of these, right?
[01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:30.520]   How to get rich quick schemes where you go to a seminar and almost invariably those
[01:26:30.520 --> 01:26:35.160]   schemas create a get rich scheme and have people come to a seminar and pay you a lot
[01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:36.160]   of money for a book.
[01:26:36.160 --> 01:26:37.720]   It's the opposite of pay it forward.
[01:26:37.720 --> 01:26:38.720]   It's like a deal.
[01:26:38.720 --> 01:26:40.200]   Pay it backwards.
[01:26:40.200 --> 01:26:43.960]   The rise in selfie deaths, back to selfie nation.
[01:26:43.960 --> 01:26:45.760]   This is from BBC's News Beat.
[01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:50.400]   The number of people who die each year taking us selfie is on the rise.
[01:26:50.400 --> 01:26:52.200]   Are those women dead in that picture?
[01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:55.320]   Yeah, I think that's I'm sure stock top to die.
[01:26:55.320 --> 01:26:57.080]   I hope they're not dead.
[01:26:57.080 --> 01:27:01.360]   But notice they are on a cliff and perilously close to the edge.
[01:27:01.360 --> 01:27:05.640]   In 2014, 15 folks died taking selfies.
[01:27:05.640 --> 01:27:08.000]   Last year, 39.
[01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:13.720]   This year, in the first eight months, 73 people died taking selfies.
[01:27:13.720 --> 01:27:17.240]   I don't know if that doesn't sound like that many really.
[01:27:17.240 --> 01:27:20.560]   I think that probably more people have died wearing flip flops than taking selfies.
[01:27:20.560 --> 01:27:23.560]   It's more people than have no sevens explode.
[01:27:23.560 --> 01:27:25.440]   I'm sure.
[01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:29.880]   More people than die from marijuana and that's illegal to have the country.
[01:27:29.880 --> 01:27:38.840]   A team of researchers who has decided to create an app to warn people when they're doing
[01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:42.760]   something stupid that could kill you.
[01:27:42.760 --> 01:27:48.640]   In India, there are more selfie deaths related to trains because according to these researchers,
[01:27:48.640 --> 01:27:52.720]   there's a belief that posing on or next to train tracks with your best friend is romantic
[01:27:52.720 --> 01:27:56.920]   and a sign of never ending friendship, bad idea.
[01:27:56.920 --> 01:28:02.520]   In the US and Russia, a high proportion of deaths due to what else?
[01:28:02.520 --> 01:28:04.760]   I thought you were going to say driving.
[01:28:04.760 --> 01:28:13.080]   Oh, by the way, for the first time in years, the highway death toll is rising dramatically
[01:28:13.080 --> 01:28:14.640]   because of distracted drivers.
[01:28:14.640 --> 01:28:16.280]   Some people blame Snapchat.
[01:28:16.280 --> 01:28:21.440]   There was a Snapchat filter that showed how fast you were going.
[01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:27.840]   At least they believe some teenagers died because moments before they got in a horrific
[01:28:27.840 --> 01:28:32.600]   fatal crash, they were Snapchatting 115 miles an hour with pictures of them.
[01:28:32.600 --> 01:28:34.880]   I'm going 115, Ma!
[01:28:34.880 --> 01:28:37.120]   Yeah, I don't like that.
[01:28:37.120 --> 01:28:40.920]   They need to put some of those apps or that where they shut down if your speed is going
[01:28:40.920 --> 01:28:41.920]   if you're going too fast or something.
[01:28:41.920 --> 01:28:47.520]   All you have to do is whenever you activate that filter, it should show the snap of the
[01:28:47.520 --> 01:28:49.520]   person who died using that filter.
[01:28:49.520 --> 01:28:50.520]   There you go.
[01:28:50.520 --> 01:28:51.520]   You could decide.
[01:28:51.520 --> 01:28:52.520]   There you go.
[01:28:52.520 --> 01:28:53.520]   Why they do that?
[01:28:53.520 --> 01:28:54.520]   There you go.
[01:28:54.520 --> 01:28:57.320]   Well, I don't don't don't people have to be responsible for themselves.
[01:28:57.320 --> 01:28:58.320]   Yes.
[01:28:58.320 --> 01:29:03.080]   Like really, there's a certain amount that you should know that if you're a near a cliff,
[01:29:03.080 --> 01:29:04.520]   maybe that might be dangerous.
[01:29:04.520 --> 01:29:08.320]   Like, like people fall off of things all the time without taking a selfie.
[01:29:08.320 --> 01:29:12.840]   I like, I think that people need to learn, you know, that sometimes by tripping and falling
[01:29:12.840 --> 01:29:14.120]   and hurting yourself, you learn, you know what?
[01:29:14.120 --> 01:29:15.320]   Maybe I shouldn't have done that.
[01:29:15.320 --> 01:29:20.040]   We we sometimes get so wrapped up in ourselves that we're not really thinking about it.
[01:29:20.040 --> 01:29:22.040]   I don't think that they need to give us any warning.
[01:29:22.040 --> 01:29:23.800]   How about distracting driving?
[01:29:23.800 --> 01:29:25.280]   You know, careful.
[01:29:25.280 --> 01:29:26.280]   That should be illegal.
[01:29:26.280 --> 01:29:27.280]   That's what we have lost.
[01:29:27.280 --> 01:29:28.280]   It's not working.
[01:29:28.280 --> 01:29:31.440]   It's not that you get arrested and you're going to lose to Merrick points if you get caught
[01:29:31.440 --> 01:29:32.440]   in.
[01:29:32.440 --> 01:29:36.440]   There's cops that just, you know, take a look and see if you're using your phone while
[01:29:36.440 --> 01:29:39.640]   you're on there and you're going to lose to Merrick points and lose your license for
[01:29:39.640 --> 01:29:40.640]   that.
[01:29:40.640 --> 01:29:41.640]   It's the same thing as drinking and driving.
[01:29:41.640 --> 01:29:45.200]   I don't know what fatalities are like in Canada, but after steady declines over the
[01:29:45.200 --> 01:29:49.240]   last four decades, according to the New York Times, highway fatalities in the US recorded
[01:29:49.240 --> 01:29:54.240]   the largest annual increase in 50 years.
[01:29:54.240 --> 01:30:02.800]   In fact, in the first six months of 2016, 10.4% increase year over year.
[01:30:02.800 --> 01:30:05.960]   It's got to be technology, right?
[01:30:05.960 --> 01:30:06.960]   Yes.
[01:30:06.960 --> 01:30:13.320]   Maybe this is where we use that snooper charter from the UK and then the government figures
[01:30:13.320 --> 01:30:18.040]   out when you're in your car using your phone and then it says, "No, no.
[01:30:18.040 --> 01:30:21.920]   Hey, maybe you shouldn't do that," or you get auto arrested and it's for your own safety.
[01:30:21.920 --> 01:30:26.000]   So they're protecting you not from terrorism, but from your stupid self.
[01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:27.000]   Maybe that works.
[01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:28.000]   Probably not.
[01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:29.000]   That's a good way to sell it, Barretun.
[01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:30.000]   That's a good way to sell it.
[01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:31.000]   I'm trying to think outside the box.
[01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:35.440]   I'm trying to help the UK government, you know, violate civil liberties even more.
[01:30:35.440 --> 01:30:38.680]   If you're not doing anything wrong while you're driving, you won't care that we're inside
[01:30:38.680 --> 01:30:39.680]   your phone.
[01:30:39.680 --> 01:30:43.760]   Yeah, that's a 10% jump.
[01:30:43.760 --> 01:30:45.840]   What happened in the one year though?
[01:30:45.840 --> 01:30:46.840]   That's what shocking.
[01:30:46.840 --> 01:30:48.280]   It's just things like Snapchat.
[01:30:48.280 --> 01:30:51.840]   I think it's also that we've got now big consoles in our car that we're fiddling with
[01:30:51.840 --> 01:30:54.120]   those because there's all this stuff going on.
[01:30:54.120 --> 01:30:55.120]   Smart cars.
[01:30:55.120 --> 01:30:57.120]   We don't have Tesla's layer.
[01:30:57.120 --> 01:30:58.120]   We don't know how to do this.
[01:30:58.120 --> 01:31:00.520]   We're addicted to our technology.
[01:31:00.520 --> 01:31:01.520]   We can't stop.
[01:31:01.520 --> 01:31:07.440]   We think that we're going to miss out on that great tweet on Owen with the filter of the
[01:31:07.440 --> 01:31:11.280]   flowers on his head and we don't want to miss out on that.
[01:31:11.280 --> 01:31:12.280]   Exactly.
[01:31:12.280 --> 01:31:13.600]   We never even shut down.
[01:31:13.600 --> 01:31:17.320]   We can constantly be found at any point in time.
[01:31:17.320 --> 01:31:18.320]   You're on a date.
[01:31:18.320 --> 01:31:19.480]   You're going out somewhere.
[01:31:19.480 --> 01:31:21.040]   You're on holiday.
[01:31:21.040 --> 01:31:22.040]   People can find you.
[01:31:22.040 --> 01:31:26.440]   We never have any downtime and that causes an addiction reaction inside of us.
[01:31:26.440 --> 01:31:30.120]   And so you end up going through withdrawal if you're even driving on a long trip and
[01:31:30.120 --> 01:31:31.560]   you can't message it.
[01:31:31.560 --> 01:31:33.560]   How many people have had at a restaurant?
[01:31:33.560 --> 01:31:37.360]   You suddenly see your friend messaging or taking pictures of the food or answering this
[01:31:37.360 --> 01:31:39.400]   because this one's really important.
[01:31:39.400 --> 01:31:42.960]   We've not been able to unplug ourselves from our tech.
[01:31:42.960 --> 01:31:43.960]   And it's not our fault.
[01:31:43.960 --> 01:31:45.760]   What if it's not our fault?
[01:31:45.760 --> 01:31:46.760]   No, it's not.
[01:31:46.760 --> 01:31:53.160]   I'll tell you why society of neuroscience meeting in San Diego this week.
[01:31:53.160 --> 01:31:54.160]   There was a study.
[01:31:54.160 --> 01:31:59.280]   They took young mice and they exposed them to six hours daily of a sound and light show
[01:31:59.280 --> 01:32:02.160]   reminiscent of a video game.
[01:32:02.160 --> 01:32:05.840]   According to the director of the Center for Integrative Brain Research at Seattle's Children's
[01:32:05.840 --> 01:32:11.520]   Hospital, the mice showed dramatic changes everywhere in the brain.
[01:32:11.520 --> 01:32:16.160]   Many of those changes suggest that you have a brain that is wired up at a much more baseline
[01:32:16.160 --> 01:32:17.160]   excited level.
[01:32:17.160 --> 01:32:20.440]   You need more stimulation to get the brain's attention.
[01:32:20.440 --> 01:32:21.840]   What are we doing to our kids now?
[01:32:21.840 --> 01:32:25.200]   We're plunking them down in front of screens as young as one and two years old and they
[01:32:25.200 --> 01:32:29.400]   have many more than six hours of screen time nonstop.
[01:32:29.400 --> 01:32:35.800]   Now the debate at this event was, well, the benefits may outweigh the negative sides to
[01:32:35.800 --> 01:32:36.800]   this.
[01:32:36.800 --> 01:32:41.480]   An evolutionary neurobiology from UC, biologists from UC Davis said, "A less sensitive brain
[01:32:41.480 --> 01:32:52.400]   might thrive in a world where overstimulation is a common problem."
[01:32:52.400 --> 01:32:57.080]   The American Academy of Pediatrics relaxed its long-standing recommendation against any
[01:32:57.080 --> 01:33:01.680]   screen time for kids under two.
[01:33:01.680 --> 01:33:04.120]   Now it's just mice.
[01:33:04.120 --> 01:33:14.640]   And we already know that, look, you don't hire psychologists, anthropologists, ethnographers,
[01:33:14.640 --> 01:33:20.840]   applied mathematicians, and other forms of mental manipulation artists for your various
[01:33:20.840 --> 01:33:24.280]   startups because you're trying to support science.
[01:33:24.280 --> 01:33:25.280]   You do that.
[01:33:25.280 --> 01:33:26.280]   That's game of fire, everything.
[01:33:26.280 --> 01:33:27.920]   Not for some general grit.
[01:33:27.920 --> 01:33:29.160]   You're not a university here.
[01:33:29.160 --> 01:33:30.600]   You're not trying to educate the public.
[01:33:30.600 --> 01:33:33.440]   You're trying to maximize shareholder value.
[01:33:33.440 --> 01:33:37.720]   And so the thing that these companies are doing, and Tristan Harris, this is my public
[01:33:37.720 --> 01:33:41.240]   service announcement, this is my plug for somebody not named Baratunde, everybody check
[01:33:41.240 --> 01:33:44.600]   out timewellspent.io.
[01:33:44.600 --> 01:33:47.520]   And he is a former product philosopher at Google.
[01:33:47.520 --> 01:33:48.960]   He's worked in the tech industry.
[01:33:48.960 --> 01:33:50.320]   He's worked in UX.
[01:33:50.320 --> 01:33:56.120]   And he's made the case that this black mirror in our hands is a slot machine.
[01:33:56.120 --> 01:33:59.160]   And it is the most advanced slot machine ever invented.
[01:33:59.160 --> 01:34:03.160]   It hacks into it, pushes all the low-level buttons.
[01:34:03.160 --> 01:34:05.840]   And we don't actually control it.
[01:34:05.840 --> 01:34:12.120]   We are small, little, tiny specs against the great onslaught of trillions of dollars of
[01:34:12.120 --> 01:34:15.640]   investment in breaking down our willpower.
[01:34:15.640 --> 01:34:21.320]   And we're encouraged all the default settings to share more, to open more, to feel socially
[01:34:21.320 --> 01:34:26.280]   obligated, to follow people back, to add more friends on something called LinkedIn for some
[01:34:26.280 --> 01:34:27.280]   reason.
[01:34:27.280 --> 01:34:33.120]   So I don't think it's as simple as we can stop and just take personal responsibility.
[01:34:33.120 --> 01:34:37.880]   Because there's this collective irresponsible action happening with the backing of trillions
[01:34:37.880 --> 01:34:42.240]   of dollars that's financially very lucrative for them to win.
[01:34:42.240 --> 01:34:45.160]   And us standing alone against that is futile.
[01:34:45.160 --> 01:34:50.200]   We need some way smarter systems on our side to help sway the balance a little bit.
[01:34:50.200 --> 01:34:51.200]   This is a good resource.
[01:34:51.200 --> 01:34:52.200]   Thank you.
[01:34:52.200 --> 01:34:54.560]   But that's never going to happen, right?
[01:34:54.560 --> 01:34:55.560]   That's never going to happen.
[01:34:55.560 --> 01:34:58.040]   It's not the way that our economies work, unfortunately.
[01:34:58.040 --> 01:35:04.000]   We have to know and understand what we let our kids, it starts off with them, consume.
[01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.680]   So I deal in technology all day.
[01:35:06.680 --> 01:35:10.720]   Like I have every single video game system under the sun, but my kids don't get to play
[01:35:10.720 --> 01:35:16.040]   but for maybe an hour or two a week of video games and TV because I know what happens to
[01:35:16.040 --> 01:35:17.200]   their brains.
[01:35:17.200 --> 01:35:19.680]   Like I just see it in my sessions all the time.
[01:35:19.680 --> 01:35:25.160]   You look, your kid looks like they're really calm, but their brainwaves are going flying.
[01:35:25.160 --> 01:35:27.440]   And after that, you get better at whatever you do.
[01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:33.680]   You are constantly every moment of every second of every day, whatever you are doing, you
[01:35:33.680 --> 01:35:38.240]   are firing neurons together that will wire together to get better at whatever that activity
[01:35:38.240 --> 01:35:39.240]   is.
[01:35:39.240 --> 01:35:42.200]   So if you're consuming a lot of fast-paced media, you're going to get better at consuming
[01:35:42.200 --> 01:35:43.200]   fast-paced media.
[01:35:43.200 --> 01:35:48.600]   But then without that media, exactly as you said, Bear Monday, is that you end up going
[01:35:48.600 --> 01:35:53.080]   through that withdrawal effect because of that, because no longer are you hooked up to
[01:35:53.080 --> 01:35:55.400]   something that you have gotten used to.
[01:35:55.400 --> 01:35:59.600]   And so we need to talk about it as the first thing so that people understand because they
[01:35:59.600 --> 01:36:04.000]   don't know how addicted they are until they end up going somewhere where they don't have
[01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:08.160]   any signal or they lose battery power and they feel that feeling of, "Oh my goodness,
[01:36:08.160 --> 01:36:13.320]   I feel like I've been disconnected from the world and I no longer feel as comfortable
[01:36:13.320 --> 01:36:14.800]   as I did before."
[01:36:14.800 --> 01:36:17.320]   So I think that, yeah, we are a certain amount responsible.
[01:36:17.320 --> 01:36:22.200]   And yes, companies definitely are spending a lot of money paying people in my field in
[01:36:22.200 --> 01:36:26.720]   order to make our levels of addiction even greater so that you'll buy more products.
[01:36:26.720 --> 01:36:28.680]   But that doesn't take us out of the equation.
[01:36:28.680 --> 01:36:33.040]   I think that we are not mindless sheep going through to the slaughter.
[01:36:33.040 --> 01:36:37.520]   We are choosing to consume these products and we need to say, when are we going to let
[01:36:37.520 --> 01:36:40.400]   ourselves calm down and shut ourselves down from them?
[01:36:40.400 --> 01:36:41.880]   And that's important.
[01:36:41.880 --> 01:36:46.960]   So we definitely need to, I'm sorry, I was just going to say, it's definitely a lot to
[01:36:46.960 --> 01:36:52.040]   do with your own personal control even though the system is against you because parents
[01:36:52.040 --> 01:36:53.040]   especially with children.
[01:36:53.040 --> 01:36:55.800]   Now, when you're an adult, you make your decisions, look at that screen for 12 hours,
[01:36:55.800 --> 01:36:56.800]   they'd ask on you.
[01:36:56.800 --> 01:37:00.360]   But when you have kids, if you're not a parent, you just stick that in front of them instead
[01:37:00.360 --> 01:37:02.640]   of giving them a book to read, that's on you.
[01:37:02.640 --> 01:37:05.360]   Like my daughter, she's got the phone, got the tablet, all that stuff.
[01:37:05.360 --> 01:37:07.800]   But in a car, she's not allowed to plan on telling her she has to read books.
[01:37:07.800 --> 01:37:10.600]   And when you get home, she has to read for hours for she can get on a thing.
[01:37:10.600 --> 01:37:11.760]   But she's watching this one show.
[01:37:11.760 --> 01:37:13.200]   It's called "Pat and Jen."
[01:37:13.200 --> 01:37:15.200]   She doesn't want to watch any TV shows.
[01:37:15.200 --> 01:37:16.440]   All she wants to do is watch "Pat and Jen."
[01:37:16.440 --> 01:37:18.120]   And I'm like, "What is this Pat and Jen?"
[01:37:18.120 --> 01:37:19.120]   I turn around and I look at it.
[01:37:19.120 --> 01:37:24.120]   I'm like, okay, it's something stupid.
[01:37:24.120 --> 01:37:29.120]   I went to her room when she was sleeping because she was talking her sleep.
[01:37:29.120 --> 01:37:31.120]   Now she's never cussing her life.
[01:37:31.120 --> 01:37:32.120]   I never heard her cuss.
[01:37:32.120 --> 01:37:33.120]   Now they say hell and damn on there.
[01:37:33.120 --> 01:37:35.120]   And she's cussing her sleep repeating "Pat and Jen."
[01:37:35.120 --> 01:37:38.120]   I was like, "Yo, she woke up and I said, I ain't no more Pat and Jen for two weeks."
[01:37:38.120 --> 01:37:39.120]   She's like, "What happened?"
[01:37:39.120 --> 01:37:41.120]   I'm like, "No, you ain't here repeating."
[01:37:41.120 --> 01:37:42.120]   She's like, "I did."
[01:37:42.120 --> 01:37:43.120]   I'm like, "Yes."
[01:37:43.120 --> 01:37:45.120]   It's in your brain and there's no more Pat and Jen.
[01:37:45.120 --> 01:37:46.120]   You can watch something else.
[01:37:46.120 --> 01:37:47.120]   You can read more.
[01:37:47.120 --> 01:37:48.120]   But you can't watch that show because it does program children especially.
[01:37:48.120 --> 01:37:52.120]   But as an adult, we need to watch out for our kids and help them not be a dick.
[01:37:52.120 --> 01:37:54.120]   That's why I cut her off in the car and all her friends complain.
[01:37:54.120 --> 01:37:55.120]   I'm like, "You got music.
[01:37:55.120 --> 01:37:56.120]   You got each other.
[01:37:56.120 --> 01:37:57.120]   Let's talk.
[01:37:57.120 --> 01:37:58.120]   Let's do radio."
[01:37:58.120 --> 01:38:01.120]   But you don't need to have your face in a screen 24/7.
[01:38:01.120 --> 01:38:02.120]   So there is some personal accountability.
[01:38:02.120 --> 01:38:03.120]   You know the machine is against us.
[01:38:03.120 --> 01:38:05.120]   It is against us.
[01:38:05.120 --> 01:38:10.120]   This is by the way why I don't have you guys on the show all the time because it's too stimulating.
[01:38:10.120 --> 01:38:15.120]   And we really want this show to be more boring and relaxing and calming.
[01:38:15.120 --> 01:38:19.120]   So to lower that, you're amazing.
[01:38:19.120 --> 01:38:26.120]   I thank you, Georgia, for making such a strong case for the power of humans.
[01:38:26.120 --> 01:38:30.120]   And I definitely don't mean to imply that we are not part of the equation.
[01:38:30.120 --> 01:38:31.120]   And you're right.
[01:38:31.120 --> 01:38:32.120]   We do have some choice in it.
[01:38:32.120 --> 01:38:35.120]   But so do companies have some responsibilities.
[01:38:35.120 --> 01:38:42.400]   No, but I think our power as individuals is overrated in a case like this where they're
[01:38:42.400 --> 01:38:47.280]   using the best of science against us and no individual has those resources to combat it.
[01:38:47.280 --> 01:38:51.840]   But I also think it's a little too defeat us to say, "We can't do anything about it
[01:38:51.840 --> 01:38:53.440]   beyond individual action."
[01:38:53.440 --> 01:38:57.600]   And that's like some of the greatest changes in the history of the world is when we've
[01:38:57.600 --> 01:39:00.520]   come together and said, "That's not acceptable.
[01:39:00.520 --> 01:39:05.000]   We don't have children working in labor camps for the most part anymore."
[01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.440]   Even though that was normal, the economy was powered by it.
[01:39:07.440 --> 01:39:11.680]   But it no longer is because we kind of drew some line and it wasn't just the goodwill
[01:39:11.680 --> 01:39:12.680]   of people.
[01:39:12.680 --> 01:39:17.040]   It was a lot of sticking together from folks who had something to lose and others who felt
[01:39:17.040 --> 01:39:18.640]   like allied with it.
[01:39:18.640 --> 01:39:21.880]   And I'm not even trying to fully equate to child labor, but I'm just saying that was
[01:39:21.880 --> 01:39:26.400]   a big deal that people could never have imagined not existing anymore.
[01:39:26.400 --> 01:39:33.200]   And I think if we don't acknowledge that the power to combat this has to involve something
[01:39:33.200 --> 01:39:37.640]   on par with the power that's suppressing our individuality, which isn't just personal
[01:39:37.640 --> 01:39:40.560]   choice, then we're not going to fight it the right way.
[01:39:40.560 --> 01:39:44.560]   And so at a minimum, just like you have people trying to get unaddicted to cigarettes and
[01:39:44.560 --> 01:39:49.360]   they use nicotine patches in these programs, like if that's just for cigarettes, which
[01:39:49.360 --> 01:39:54.800]   is relatively minor compared to all the mind hacking going on in your Instagram feed alone.
[01:39:54.800 --> 01:39:56.640]   Like why is the feed bottomless?
[01:39:56.640 --> 01:39:58.280]   This is one of Tristan's major points.
[01:39:58.280 --> 01:40:03.560]   Like any service that gives you an infinite scroll is attacking your mind because it's
[01:40:03.560 --> 01:40:04.760]   luring you constantly.
[01:40:04.760 --> 01:40:05.760]   You never finish.
[01:40:05.760 --> 01:40:07.520]   What if you're a book that had infinite pages?
[01:40:07.520 --> 01:40:09.680]   You would never finish the book.
[01:40:09.680 --> 01:40:13.560]   That's psychotic, but that's Instagram and Facebook and Twitter.
[01:40:13.560 --> 01:40:20.200]   That's the default setting because it benefits them and not us to stay on that system all
[01:40:20.200 --> 01:40:21.200]   the time.
[01:40:21.200 --> 01:40:23.600]   And we can't just fight that one person at a time.
[01:40:23.600 --> 01:40:28.040]   We can at a minimum have some tech tools to help us know how much time we've spent to
[01:40:28.040 --> 01:40:33.960]   set some personal limits or at least assist us in maintaining our willpower and those
[01:40:33.960 --> 01:40:35.280]   declarations that we make.
[01:40:35.280 --> 01:40:39.360]   Otherwise, those declarations are pretty meaningless compared to all this science that's
[01:40:39.360 --> 01:40:40.360]   fighting us.
[01:40:40.360 --> 01:40:43.960]   We have only a few more minutes with Baratunde like four.
[01:40:43.960 --> 01:40:46.080]   Oh, and I can I updated.
[01:40:46.080 --> 01:40:48.640]   I got a new GPS route.
[01:40:48.640 --> 01:40:51.280]   Speaking of tech that's helping me be mindless.
[01:40:51.280 --> 01:40:53.240]   And a little more time with us.
[01:40:53.240 --> 01:40:55.320]   We can I can go until at least APM.
[01:40:55.320 --> 01:40:56.560]   Oh, that'd be great.
[01:40:56.560 --> 01:40:57.560]   Okay.
[01:40:57.560 --> 01:40:59.480]   We get 11 more minutes with Baratunde.
[01:40:59.480 --> 01:41:00.480]   That's double.
[01:41:00.480 --> 01:41:02.280]   I just doubled it.
[01:41:02.280 --> 01:41:06.000]   Let's let's well, I don't want to waste that time, but I quickly need to take a break
[01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:09.240]   and we'll have more Baratunde's here, Georgia Dow.
[01:41:09.240 --> 01:41:10.720]   Oh, doctor, I love these guys.
[01:41:10.720 --> 01:41:11.720]   And I love this panel.
[01:41:11.720 --> 01:41:12.720]   Thank you for being here today.
[01:41:12.720 --> 01:41:13.720]   It really is fantastic.
[01:41:13.720 --> 01:41:17.480]   Our show today brought to you by Harry's for guys who want a great shave experience
[01:41:17.480 --> 01:41:19.760]   for a fraction of what you're paying now.
[01:41:19.760 --> 01:41:21.240]   You know, I started growing a beard.
[01:41:21.240 --> 01:41:23.000]   I wanted to be like Baratunde.
[01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:24.000]   And man, I went out.
[01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:25.000]   It's expensive.
[01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:26.000]   Haven't a beard.
[01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:27.060]   I thought this would save me time and money.
[01:41:27.060 --> 01:41:32.400]   I had to get beard oil, beard, balm, beard comb, beard brush, beard shampoo.
[01:41:32.400 --> 01:41:33.560]   And then I said screw it.
[01:41:33.560 --> 01:41:35.880]   I'm going back to Harry's and I shaved.
[01:41:35.880 --> 01:41:36.880]   I'll hold beard ecosystem.
[01:41:36.880 --> 01:41:39.160]   I had a beard ecosystem and now I don't know.
[01:41:39.160 --> 01:41:41.520]   I'll send it to you.
[01:41:41.520 --> 01:41:42.520]   Harry's is awesome.
[01:41:42.520 --> 01:41:44.080]   In fact, they've got the brand new.
[01:41:44.080 --> 01:41:45.920]   This is a great gift idea.
[01:41:45.920 --> 01:41:50.720]   Certainly if you if everybody even if you have a beard, you have to shave unless you
[01:41:50.720 --> 01:41:54.480]   want to have a beard that goes all the way down to your navel.
[01:41:54.480 --> 01:42:00.080]   Harry's has a great deal for holiday shopping for anybody, a thoughtful gift that's useful
[01:42:00.080 --> 01:42:05.200]   and practical and affordable like this, the winter Winston.
[01:42:05.200 --> 01:42:06.200]   This is beautiful.
[01:42:06.200 --> 01:42:07.200]   It's a limited edition.
[01:42:07.200 --> 01:42:10.600]   They did this last year with winter Winston was a copper handle.
[01:42:10.600 --> 01:42:13.120]   Now they've got a midnight blue chrome razor handle.
[01:42:13.120 --> 01:42:14.480]   You can get it engraved with initials.
[01:42:14.480 --> 01:42:16.320]   This makes it extra special.
[01:42:16.320 --> 01:42:20.880]   And of course, as with all of Harry's shaving kits, you get three of their German engineered
[01:42:20.880 --> 01:42:25.200]   five blade cartridges that give you a beautiful, close, comfortable shave.
[01:42:25.200 --> 01:42:29.760]   Foaming shave gel that smells amazing, the beautifully designed gift box.
[01:42:29.760 --> 01:42:34.960]   Now it is normally $30 on harries.com, but we've partnered with Harry's to give you $5
[01:42:34.960 --> 01:42:36.240]   off on your order.
[01:42:36.240 --> 01:42:40.840]   Just use the offer code TWIT5 and you're going to $5 off.
[01:42:40.840 --> 01:42:42.440]   And this is a really nice gift.
[01:42:42.440 --> 01:42:45.560]   And if you really want a gift that keeps on giving, get a subscription for the blades
[01:42:45.560 --> 01:42:48.480]   and the shave gel or the shave cream.
[01:42:48.480 --> 01:42:51.040]   And so you're going to make somebody very happy.
[01:42:51.040 --> 01:42:55.840]   Harry's blades are better than the drugster blades at half the cost because they bought
[01:42:55.840 --> 01:42:58.160]   the factory in Germany.
[01:42:58.160 --> 01:43:00.640]   And I have to admit, I was growing that beard.
[01:43:00.640 --> 01:43:02.160]   I kind of missed my Harry's.
[01:43:02.160 --> 01:43:04.680]   It was like a reunion with a loved one.
[01:43:04.680 --> 01:43:07.800]   I shaved up that beard and I got back with Harry's.
[01:43:07.800 --> 01:43:11.480]   Go to harries.com right now to get $5 off a limited edition holiday shave set while
[01:43:11.480 --> 01:43:12.760]   supplies last.

[01:43:19.480 --> 01:43:26.200]   So if you want to get it for the holidays, do not delay harries.com.
[01:43:26.200 --> 01:43:28.800]   Don't forget the offer code TWIT5.
[01:43:28.800 --> 01:43:31.040]   That's for $5 off.
[01:43:31.040 --> 01:43:35.840]   Barriton, since you're about to take off, was there any story that you wanted to talk
[01:43:35.840 --> 01:43:37.840]   about that we haven't talked about yet?
[01:43:37.840 --> 01:43:42.760]   Oh, no, I mean, I threw in a bunch of links about the fake news stuff and the Facebook
[01:43:42.760 --> 01:43:44.480]   and the election thing.
[01:43:44.480 --> 01:43:48.000]   So I feel like we actually dealt with that a bit.
[01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:55.160]   I hate to see Facebook, the responsibility laid all at Facebook's feet.
[01:43:55.160 --> 01:43:56.160]   Fake news is everywhere.
[01:43:56.160 --> 01:43:57.320]   We've talked about this before.
[01:43:57.320 --> 01:43:58.400]   You listened to the show last week.
[01:43:58.400 --> 01:43:59.400]   It was one of the topics.
[01:43:59.400 --> 01:44:02.200]   I used to work for the world's premier fake news outlet.
[01:44:02.200 --> 01:44:03.200]   Yeah.
[01:44:03.200 --> 01:44:04.960]   Sometimes fake news has a value.
[01:44:04.960 --> 01:44:07.240]   Unless the evil than the new breed.
[01:44:07.240 --> 01:44:08.240]   Yeah.
[01:44:08.240 --> 01:44:12.880]   And, you know, but people share fake news because it's more, it says more than this,
[01:44:12.880 --> 01:44:15.280]   this is the story that you should read.
[01:44:15.280 --> 01:44:17.240]   It's especially this kind of fake news.
[01:44:17.240 --> 01:44:18.240]   It's visceral.
[01:44:18.240 --> 01:44:20.560]   It's about my beliefs.
[01:44:20.560 --> 01:44:25.440]   And I just don't think, I think the way to get rid of fake news is to give people information
[01:44:25.440 --> 01:44:31.120]   to, and I think, you know, Jeff Jarvis had a great medium post in which he proposed exactly
[01:44:31.120 --> 01:44:32.120]   that.
[01:44:32.120 --> 01:44:36.680]   Not censoring Facebook, but getting tools on Facebook for making it easier for people
[01:44:36.680 --> 01:44:43.200]   to report something that's blatantly false to have Facebook maybe add additional links.
[01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:48.200]   He did this with John Borthwick of Buzzfeed to sites like Snopes.
[01:44:48.200 --> 01:44:49.400]   John Borthwick of beta works.
[01:44:49.400 --> 01:44:50.400]   I'm sorry, beta works.
[01:44:50.400 --> 01:44:51.400]   Not Buzzfeed.
[01:44:51.400 --> 01:44:52.400]   You're right.
[01:44:52.400 --> 01:44:53.400]   Thank you.
[01:44:53.400 --> 01:44:54.400]   I'm here to do real time fact checking.
[01:44:54.400 --> 01:44:56.400]   See what it doe by in?
[01:44:56.400 --> 01:44:57.400]   Yeah.
[01:44:57.400 --> 01:44:59.040]   What an all steps for Facebook.
[01:44:59.040 --> 01:45:01.280]   I don't, I don't, I mean, it's not just Facebook.
[01:45:01.280 --> 01:45:02.280]   It's everywhere.
[01:45:02.280 --> 01:45:06.400]   This is kind of the nature of the beast now is that there's a lot of information flowing
[01:45:06.400 --> 01:45:07.960]   all over us.
[01:45:07.960 --> 01:45:14.000]   And to some extent, it's our responsibility too to teach our up and coming young people
[01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.400]   how to decide what's real and not.
[01:45:16.400 --> 01:45:21.160]   I mean, I think what we've done, and I can't take full credit for some of this language,
[01:45:21.160 --> 01:45:22.440]   but I agree with it fully.
[01:45:22.440 --> 01:45:23.520]   And I'm the one saying it now.
[01:45:23.520 --> 01:45:26.800]   So you can say you heard it for me, but I didn't create it.
[01:45:26.800 --> 01:45:28.440]   We have torn down a lot.
[01:45:28.440 --> 01:45:33.440]   Like the internet has destroyed so much of how we knew the world to work.
[01:45:33.440 --> 01:45:38.880]   It destroyed some real heinous things like the music industry, which, you know, we're
[01:45:38.880 --> 01:45:44.720]   not operating in the best interest of many, though a lot of good people have lost in the
[01:45:44.720 --> 01:45:46.960]   way the new system is starting to emerge.
[01:45:46.960 --> 01:45:53.840]   It's destroyed most incumbent institutions will not either survive or look at all like the
[01:45:53.840 --> 01:46:00.080]   way they have in how they achieve their power and media as a structure, not just the media
[01:46:00.080 --> 01:46:04.960]   business, not just the news in particular, but all kinds of content totally different.
[01:46:04.960 --> 01:46:07.320]   And we've torn down the way it used to be done.
[01:46:07.320 --> 01:46:10.560]   And we haven't fully established what it's going to be.
[01:46:10.560 --> 01:46:12.400]   And so we've mostly broken the world.
[01:46:12.400 --> 01:46:13.400]   Right.
[01:46:13.400 --> 01:46:15.480]   And that's true in every, as you say, in every industry.
[01:46:15.480 --> 01:46:20.560]   Education, in banking, in politics, like you just see everything will fall.
[01:46:20.560 --> 01:46:24.440]   And that sounds like ominous, but I think it's just a fact.
[01:46:24.440 --> 01:46:29.400]   And we haven't rebuilt much less, you know, we haven't even redesigned much less rebuilt
[01:46:29.400 --> 01:46:30.720]   what we wanted to look like.
[01:46:30.720 --> 01:46:36.440]   And so we developed norms in the old media system as lazy as it could be as corrupt as
[01:46:36.440 --> 01:46:37.520]   it could be.
[01:46:37.520 --> 01:46:39.400]   It had norms, it had expectations.
[01:46:39.400 --> 01:46:45.320]   You had some understanding, some semblance of what fairness was this new system ripped
[01:46:45.320 --> 01:46:47.040]   all that to stress.
[01:46:47.040 --> 01:46:54.440]   And so when it's profitable, when it's extremely profitable, the traffic in absolute lies, and
[01:46:54.440 --> 01:46:55.680]   there's no check on that.
[01:46:55.680 --> 01:46:59.760]   Like that's a feature because we're in the in between, right?
[01:46:59.760 --> 01:47:02.520]   We're in the upside down of the real world right now.
[01:47:02.520 --> 01:47:04.000]   We haven't been able to come back through.
[01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:05.600]   I'm throwing a lot of metaphors out there.
[01:47:05.600 --> 01:47:07.200]   I think people are keeping up.
[01:47:07.200 --> 01:47:14.560]   So I get a little bit distraught and depressed and upset, but then it helps for me to remember
[01:47:14.560 --> 01:47:19.200]   that it's actually a great opportunity for us in all this chaos because this is just
[01:47:19.200 --> 01:47:25.560]   officially the chaos era to define what some of that new order might look like.
[01:47:25.560 --> 01:47:29.080]   And can it distribute power more fairly than the last system?
[01:47:29.080 --> 01:47:31.520]   We all have superpowers in the palm of our hands now.
[01:47:31.520 --> 01:47:32.520]   That's pretty cool.
[01:47:32.520 --> 01:47:33.520]   That wasn't the case before.
[01:47:33.520 --> 01:47:38.040]   But we're also super vulnerable in ways that we weren't before because we didn't get our
[01:47:38.040 --> 01:47:42.040]   news from our uncles and our grandparents and our nephews and our cousins.
[01:47:42.040 --> 01:47:45.760]   We got it from people who had some sense of training and narrow and underverses they
[01:47:45.760 --> 01:47:46.960]   were.
[01:47:46.960 --> 01:47:51.760]   They had some basic shared set of rules that have been thrown out the window and we haven't
[01:47:51.760 --> 01:47:52.760]   rewritten new ones.
[01:47:52.760 --> 01:47:57.760]   So I think that's to me, that's part of the bigger issue is that we just haven't redefined
[01:47:57.760 --> 01:48:01.120]   and redesigned the world as we'd like to live in it yet.
[01:48:01.120 --> 01:48:04.480]   And we're suffering through the chaos and just being mad at being stuck in between
[01:48:04.480 --> 01:48:05.480]   both.
[01:48:05.480 --> 01:48:11.680]   I think that's very insightful and exactly the right long view on this is we live, you
[01:48:11.680 --> 01:48:14.800]   know, the old Chinese curse me, you live in interesting times.
[01:48:14.800 --> 01:48:18.800]   This is the disruption that we knew would happen.
[01:48:18.800 --> 01:48:20.880]   In fact, and this is where I feel bad.
[01:48:20.880 --> 01:48:24.080]   I wanted it to happen because I looked at the internet and thought this is the ultimate
[01:48:24.080 --> 01:48:25.680]   democratizing force.
[01:48:25.680 --> 01:48:26.680]   Everybody gets a voice.
[01:48:26.680 --> 01:48:29.240]   Has your mind been like, "This is fucking crazy."
[01:48:29.240 --> 01:48:34.360]   Yeah, I didn't anticipate and I don't think any of us anticipated some of the downsides
[01:48:34.360 --> 01:48:36.400]   of everybody having a voice.
[01:48:36.400 --> 01:48:41.680]   But that's fine because we will reinvent this and we just have to do it.
[01:48:41.680 --> 01:48:46.400]   We just have to all be human and be respectful and loving of one another and do the best
[01:48:46.400 --> 01:48:50.520]   we can to make remake the world in a way that works for everybody.
[01:48:50.520 --> 01:48:53.280]   I think it's possible.
[01:48:53.280 --> 01:48:57.360]   It might be that something, something years in this earth that I've got a black man,
[01:48:57.360 --> 01:49:00.760]   but the world has not always been a great place in general.
[01:49:00.760 --> 01:49:04.800]   The world is never going to, I mean, unless we get to Star Trek time, there are good people,
[01:49:04.800 --> 01:49:06.320]   there are bad people.
[01:49:06.320 --> 01:49:07.960]   And that's kind of where the cookie crumbles.
[01:49:07.960 --> 01:49:09.080]   You gave everybody a voice.
[01:49:09.080 --> 01:49:13.400]   Of course, a third or a half or a quarter of those voices are going to be terrible voices.
[01:49:13.400 --> 01:49:18.240]   And they have the right to have their voice and come right and pontificate with themselves.
[01:49:18.240 --> 01:49:20.800]   It's just when they spill off and attack others with their rhetoric.
[01:49:20.800 --> 01:49:21.800]   That's a problem.
[01:49:21.800 --> 01:49:25.440]   But I mean, you are a butterfly unicorn happy man.
[01:49:25.440 --> 01:49:28.600]   You're thinking about the world.
[01:49:28.600 --> 01:49:29.880]   Yeah, you do believe.
[01:49:29.880 --> 01:49:30.880]   I don't believe.
[01:49:30.880 --> 01:49:31.880]   No, I've read.
[01:49:31.880 --> 01:49:33.760]   No, I'm on your right and I've read a lot of history.
[01:49:33.760 --> 01:49:37.720]   And but I have to say, the history of the world was worse.
[01:49:37.720 --> 01:49:41.000]   We have improved.
[01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.640]   We had a very bloody century in the 20th century.
[01:49:43.640 --> 01:49:44.640]   That wasn't good.
[01:49:44.640 --> 01:49:46.600]   A lot of bad things happened.
[01:49:46.600 --> 01:49:51.440]   But I think we came out of it into the 21st century and overall we've looked were far
[01:49:51.440 --> 01:49:53.440]   from perfect, far from it.
[01:49:53.440 --> 01:49:58.720]   The 21st century, if we want to get to the, okay, look, I'm going to just cut this short.
[01:49:58.720 --> 01:50:01.120]   Yes, we're doing better.
[01:50:01.120 --> 01:50:06.480]   The one thing I'm very happy and thankful for about a Trump victory is that a lot of
[01:50:06.480 --> 01:50:11.760]   people that were doing misdeeds and power positions of power were doing things to people
[01:50:11.760 --> 01:50:13.400]   without making their voice heard.
[01:50:13.400 --> 01:50:17.600]   Now we have mayors talking about the first lady being a monkey.
[01:50:17.600 --> 01:50:23.360]   We have police officers on her Facebook talking about people in their district and
[01:50:23.360 --> 01:50:25.680]   their community and they get fired.
[01:50:25.680 --> 01:50:29.800]   So I thank Donald Trump so much for cutting the grass so we can see the snakes and we can
[01:50:29.800 --> 01:50:33.360]   get rid of the snakes that are stupid enough to put their voice out there for the public.
[01:50:33.360 --> 01:50:36.080]   That's the best thing about what's going on right now.
[01:50:36.080 --> 01:50:41.400]   You want to try and destroy somebody else's livelihood and make someone downtrodden.
[01:50:41.400 --> 01:50:44.960]   Go ahead and do it now because now we got your picture, we got your face, we got your
[01:50:44.960 --> 01:50:47.160]   name, you're going to lose your job and be sitting at home and have something really
[01:50:47.160 --> 01:50:48.160]   important to cry about.
[01:50:48.160 --> 01:50:51.160]   That's the only thing that's going on good right now with people acting crazy.
[01:50:51.160 --> 01:50:53.480]   Yeah, I think there are lots of things going on.
[01:50:53.480 --> 01:50:57.880]   But I think on balance technology moves us forward and has made us made progress.
[01:50:57.880 --> 01:51:01.600]   There are negatives there backwards steps.
[01:51:01.600 --> 01:51:03.400]   This was a kind of a backwards step.
[01:51:03.400 --> 01:51:07.800]   Yeah, well, I'm not even just this disruption, this disruption that you were talking about
[01:51:07.800 --> 01:51:11.440]   Baratunde, but I think on balance it is forward progress.
[01:51:11.440 --> 01:51:12.440]   I really do.
[01:51:12.440 --> 01:51:13.440]   Maybe I'm foolish.
[01:51:13.440 --> 01:51:16.560]   No, I think you're absolutely right.
[01:51:16.560 --> 01:51:20.520]   We are in the safest part of the world, time of the world that we have ever lived in.
[01:51:20.520 --> 01:51:25.320]   If we talk about even all the world, this is the safest that we've ever been.
[01:51:25.320 --> 01:51:30.920]   But the problem is with us, the only thing that can really fight this, it's not Facebook,
[01:51:30.920 --> 01:51:33.760]   it's not the problem with fake news, it's education.
[01:51:33.760 --> 01:51:38.760]   If we need to have education and it needs to be free and it needs to be for everyone,
[01:51:38.760 --> 01:51:43.080]   that is the only way that we will really battle this because unfortunately if you do not have
[01:51:43.080 --> 01:51:48.000]   the education to understand the economics of what we are dealing with in what would be
[01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:52.160]   fake news, we are made, if we see something enough, we believe it.
[01:51:52.160 --> 01:51:55.280]   Whether it be true or not, your parents tell you that you are stupid, you might be the
[01:51:55.280 --> 01:51:56.840]   most brilliant person on this planet.
[01:51:56.840 --> 01:51:57.840]   But you believe it.
[01:51:57.840 --> 01:51:59.520]   You hear it enough, you will start to believe it.
[01:51:59.520 --> 01:52:02.520]   It's the way we're made to be mimics.
[01:52:02.520 --> 01:52:05.760]   And that's one of the things that kept loud us just survive.
[01:52:05.760 --> 01:52:09.920]   But it's also a really big issue because if we don't have any other facts to be able
[01:52:09.920 --> 01:52:15.640]   to refute that, we're going to be falling into cognitive bias and then cognitive dissonance,
[01:52:15.640 --> 01:52:18.720]   which means that we have a certain belief system.
[01:52:18.720 --> 01:52:24.960]   We actually don't like to hear any other views that are opposed to whatever we already believe.
[01:52:24.960 --> 01:52:28.160]   And that becomes an issue that we don't want the truth.
[01:52:28.160 --> 01:52:32.680]   We want things that say that whatever I believe already is true because that makes us feel
[01:52:32.680 --> 01:52:33.680]   comfortable.
[01:52:33.680 --> 01:52:39.560]   We end up feeling anxiety and disdain when other opposing views are going to conflict
[01:52:39.560 --> 01:52:43.320]   with us and that's very distressing for our system.
[01:52:43.320 --> 01:52:46.120]   So we need to be able to get out there, we need to talk about it.
[01:52:46.120 --> 01:52:49.320]   But in the end, we need to give education to everyone.
[01:52:49.320 --> 01:52:51.680]   And it's something that everyone should fight behind.
[01:52:51.680 --> 01:52:53.440]   And I think that everyone can stand behind that.
[01:52:53.440 --> 01:52:56.080]   It's so very important.
[01:52:56.080 --> 01:52:57.080]   Love it.
[01:52:57.080 --> 01:53:00.160]   We have to send Baratunde to the Batmobile.
[01:53:00.160 --> 01:53:03.720]   But Baratunde, I want to leave you on an upbeat note.
[01:53:03.720 --> 01:53:04.720]   Good news.
[01:53:04.720 --> 01:53:08.120]   Metallica's full catalog is now available on Napster.
[01:53:08.120 --> 01:53:10.120]   I just wanted to know.
[01:53:10.120 --> 01:53:13.120]   I have been waiting a long time to back you.
[01:53:13.120 --> 01:53:14.120]   I know you have.
[01:53:14.120 --> 01:53:16.520]   And sorry for dropping that word.
[01:53:16.520 --> 01:53:17.840]   You can bleep it out.
[01:53:17.840 --> 01:53:19.840]   But good for them.
[01:53:19.840 --> 01:53:21.320]   It's better late than never.
[01:53:21.320 --> 01:53:22.800]   Thank you so much for having me.
[01:53:22.800 --> 01:53:25.760]   I feel like I went to church today with Georgia doctor.
[01:53:25.760 --> 01:53:30.760]   Dr. George just took us to the doctor doctor doctor doctor.
[01:53:30.760 --> 01:53:31.760]   She's a real doctor.
[01:53:31.760 --> 01:53:32.760]   He just plays with a video.
[01:53:32.760 --> 01:53:33.760]   I'm a real doctor.
[01:53:33.760 --> 01:53:38.320]   The choir, the church, the sweat for this Sunday.
[01:53:38.320 --> 01:53:39.320]   Thanks for having me back.
[01:53:39.320 --> 01:53:40.320]   I've missed the camera.
[01:53:40.320 --> 01:53:43.760]   Hello, Heathers and listeners.
[01:53:43.760 --> 01:53:45.080]   Find me on Baratunde.com.
[01:53:45.080 --> 01:53:46.760]   I'm doing the Nat Geo thing.
[01:53:46.760 --> 01:53:47.760]   Very excited about it.
[01:53:47.760 --> 01:53:53.120]   I'll be doing a Facebook live chat noon Eastern on my page about that Nat Geo episode to
[01:53:53.120 --> 01:54:00.560]   talk about policing, criminal justice and other hilarious topics with serious issues
[01:54:00.560 --> 01:54:01.560]   facing our society.
[01:54:01.560 --> 01:54:02.560]   So thanks everybody.
[01:54:02.560 --> 01:54:03.560]   See you.
[01:54:03.560 --> 01:54:04.560]   Baratunde.
[01:54:04.560 --> 01:54:05.560]   Thanks.
[01:54:05.560 --> 01:54:07.560]   See you to the Batcave.
[01:54:07.560 --> 01:54:12.480]   All right, we will reset the set while we're doing that.
[01:54:12.480 --> 01:54:15.920]   Let's take a look at some of the things you might have missed this week on Twitter.
[01:54:15.920 --> 01:54:17.720]   Adiosly on Twitter.
[01:54:17.720 --> 01:54:21.480]   I think the sound is pretty good.
[01:54:21.480 --> 01:54:24.000]   Let me.
[01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:26.360]   Macker size.
[01:54:26.360 --> 01:54:28.040]   Twitter live specials.
[01:54:28.040 --> 01:54:31.560]   We've seen a hydrogen fuel cell vehicle that you can actually buy today.
[01:54:31.560 --> 01:54:34.320]   We've seen an autonomous vehicle that tries better than I do.
[01:54:34.320 --> 01:54:40.680]   We've seen every automaker in this hall adapt and adopt to a world that is far more connected,
[01:54:40.680 --> 01:54:45.240]   far more intelligent and far more Silicon Valley than it is Detroit.
[01:54:45.240 --> 01:54:53.000]   That's why Twitter TV has come here to Los Angeles for the LA Auto Show Auto Mobility 2016.
[01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:54.000]   Windows Weekly.
[01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:58.200]   We're going to try to demonstrate haul ends over Skype.
[01:54:58.200 --> 01:55:02.240]   We're talking about haul ends applications in real world use cases.
[01:55:02.240 --> 01:55:03.800]   Like this is these are actual.
[01:55:03.800 --> 01:55:10.040]   Fact of skippable airport here is the major hop airport and we see life data of all the
[01:55:10.040 --> 01:55:11.040]   aircraft.
[01:55:11.040 --> 01:55:12.120]   This is the future of UI.
[01:55:12.120 --> 01:55:13.280]   You totally can see that.
[01:55:13.280 --> 01:55:18.920]   Do you see maybe air traffic controllers maybe even using sirely love to talk to these guys
[01:55:18.920 --> 01:55:19.920]   to it?
[01:55:19.920 --> 01:55:22.000]   Twint with your head not over it.
[01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:25.080]   All right guys, here's how I listen to tech news today.
[01:55:25.080 --> 01:55:26.080]   See if you can follow.
[01:55:26.080 --> 01:55:27.080]   Hey, what's going on?
[01:55:27.080 --> 01:55:28.080]   Let's find a breeze.
[01:55:28.080 --> 01:55:31.080]   Give us a flash briefing from the sweet beach.
[01:55:31.080 --> 01:55:32.080]   I'm making her ready.
[01:55:32.080 --> 01:55:35.320]   I'm just now from Texas.
[01:55:35.320 --> 01:55:36.880]   By the way, we are on.
[01:55:36.880 --> 01:55:39.720]   If you have an Amazon Echo, we are a part of the flash briefing.
[01:55:39.720 --> 01:55:44.040]   It might not be immediately apparent, but if you go to your app and you go to the flash
[01:55:44.040 --> 01:55:46.480]   briefing settings, search for Twitt.
[01:55:46.480 --> 01:55:51.120]   You can get a daily dose of tech news from Megan and Jason and this show and the new
[01:55:51.120 --> 01:55:55.120]   screen savers on your Amazon Echo.
[01:55:55.120 --> 01:55:58.520]   Megan Moroni is here with a look at what's ahead this week on Twitt Megan.
[01:55:58.520 --> 01:55:59.520]   Thanks, Leo.
[01:55:59.520 --> 01:56:02.600]   Let's look at just a few of the stories that we'll be watching in the week ahead.
[01:56:02.600 --> 01:56:06.600]   Now, this week is a short one since it's Thanksgiving here in the United States, so
[01:56:06.600 --> 01:56:09.600]   the studio will be dark on Thursday and Friday.
[01:56:09.600 --> 01:56:13.200]   So we can all spend some time thinking about what we're grateful for.
[01:56:13.200 --> 01:56:17.880]   And speaking of Thanksgiving, the first episode of the nine part football VR series is set
[01:56:17.880 --> 01:56:22.280]   to launch on YouTube and the Google Daydream headset this week on Thanksgiving Day.
[01:56:22.280 --> 01:56:27.800]   So gather your family and all your VR goggles to watch because nothing spells togetherness
[01:56:27.800 --> 01:56:30.720]   more than a family in their own virtual worlds.
[01:56:30.720 --> 01:56:35.080]   But before that, Tuesday is the official launch of the OnePlus 3T.
[01:56:35.080 --> 01:56:37.440]   The phone starts at $439.
[01:56:37.440 --> 01:56:42.800]   It has a faster processor, bigger battery, and there's a new 128 gigabyte version.
[01:56:42.800 --> 01:56:45.320]   This Wednesday is Fibonacci day.
[01:56:45.320 --> 01:56:51.680]   That's 1123 or 1123, which starts the Fibonacci sequence, or each number in the series.
[01:56:51.680 --> 01:56:54.040]   This is some of the two numbers behind it.
[01:56:54.040 --> 01:56:57.400]   And I must say Fibonacci is my favorite sequence.
[01:56:57.400 --> 01:57:03.160]   Wednesday is also the deadline for trading in your old Macbook to Microsoft for 650 big
[01:57:03.160 --> 01:57:04.800]   ones off a new service book.
[01:57:04.800 --> 01:57:06.280]   That's $650.
[01:57:06.280 --> 01:57:08.200]   Does that convince you to be a switcher?
[01:57:08.200 --> 01:57:12.120]   And yes, of course, this week is Black Friday, where you can do all your shopping with some
[01:57:12.120 --> 01:57:17.520]   crazy online sales, but some of you might also choose to celebrate it as by nothing
[01:57:17.520 --> 01:57:18.520]   day.
[01:57:18.520 --> 01:57:23.560]   And I personally think we should all celebrate it as update your parents browser day.
[01:57:23.560 --> 01:57:25.000]   It doesn't have to be your parents either.
[01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:29.200]   If you're spending this holiday with any family less technical than you are, remind them to
[01:57:29.200 --> 01:57:32.800]   update everything, especially all of their passwords.
[01:57:32.800 --> 01:57:36.440]   And while you're at it, we're not encouraged them to turn on some two factor authentication.
[01:57:36.440 --> 01:57:40.560]   We'll be covering these stories and I'll hold a lot more this week on Tech News today
[01:57:40.560 --> 01:57:41.560]   with Jason Howell.
[01:57:41.560 --> 01:57:47.000]   It's every day at 4 p.m. Pacific right here on this channel you're watching.
[01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:48.000]   Back to you, Leo.
[01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:49.000]   Thank you, Megan.
[01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:50.240]   Megan Moroni.
[01:57:50.240 --> 01:57:51.240]   She joins us everybody Friday.
[01:57:51.240 --> 01:57:52.240]   Love Megan.
[01:57:52.240 --> 01:57:53.240]   Yeah, she's great.
[01:57:53.240 --> 01:57:54.960]   She might have to get that OnePlus phone.
[01:57:54.960 --> 01:57:57.320]   Yeah, the 3T looks really nice.
[01:57:57.320 --> 01:57:58.320]   That's what Leo uses.
[01:57:58.320 --> 01:57:59.480]   I forgot which one she has.
[01:57:59.480 --> 01:58:02.160]   She has the OnePlus 2 or 1 or the 3T.
[01:58:02.160 --> 01:58:04.400]   Yeah, I think the...
[01:58:04.400 --> 01:58:06.760]   I like this real on.
[01:58:06.760 --> 01:58:08.920]   Fibonacci day, you're going to celebrate?
[01:58:08.920 --> 01:58:14.600]   There's a restaurant in Montreal that's called Fibonacci, but the food's horrible.
[01:58:14.600 --> 01:58:16.320]   So we're not celebrating.
[01:58:16.320 --> 01:58:17.760]   They're good at math, just not...
[01:58:17.760 --> 01:58:19.560]   It's a nice sequence anyway.
[01:58:19.560 --> 01:58:21.000]   Hey, you know what's good at Wi-Fi?
[01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:22.000]   This thing, this little thing.
[01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:23.000]   Have you ever seen this?
[01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:27.920]   This is the ERO, E-E-R-O, our show today brought to you by ERO.
[01:58:27.920 --> 01:58:30.680]   And I have to say, when I'm at home, I have two networks.
[01:58:30.680 --> 01:58:31.680]   So I can test stuff.
[01:58:31.680 --> 01:58:37.440]   I have a Comcast business and a Comcast consumer, and I have two different router systems.
[01:58:37.440 --> 01:58:41.720]   And every time I get home, every device in my pocket, every laptop, they all switch over
[01:58:41.720 --> 01:58:43.720]   to the ERO, they go, "Oh, this is good.
[01:58:43.720 --> 01:58:44.720]   I like this.
[01:58:44.720 --> 01:58:47.240]   I can't get them to use that other system."
[01:58:47.240 --> 01:58:49.800]   That's because ERO really works.
[01:58:49.800 --> 01:58:52.680]   It is a better Wi-Fi.
[01:58:52.680 --> 01:58:58.880]   Of course, it does all the things right that we talk about, WPA2 encryption built in.
[01:58:58.880 --> 01:58:59.960]   You don't have to hide it.
[01:58:59.960 --> 01:59:01.760]   It looks great in your house.
[01:59:01.760 --> 01:59:03.280]   The phone support is good.
[01:59:03.280 --> 01:59:04.360]   In fact, I tested them.
[01:59:04.360 --> 01:59:05.360]   I had...
[01:59:05.360 --> 01:59:06.840]   Well, okay, I wasn't just testing them.
[01:59:06.840 --> 01:59:07.840]   I was having...
[01:59:07.840 --> 01:59:10.040]   I couldn't figure out what was going on with my port forwarding.
[01:59:10.040 --> 01:59:11.720]   And they really did a great job.
[01:59:11.720 --> 01:59:14.440]   They stuck with me till we figured it out and they solved it.
[01:59:14.440 --> 01:59:16.000]   They're good.
[01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:18.360]   The way you set up the ERO is also cool.
[01:59:18.360 --> 01:59:21.560]   You combine individual ERO, but most of the time you're going to get three of them, the
[01:59:21.560 --> 01:59:22.760]   three pack.
[01:59:22.760 --> 01:59:26.720]   And then you set up the first one, you connect that to your cable modem or router.
[01:59:26.720 --> 01:59:32.840]   And then use the app to place the other two to spread using a mesh network throughout
[01:59:32.840 --> 01:59:33.840]   your house.
[01:59:33.840 --> 01:59:37.720]   If you have other Ethernet drops, you can actually connect the other EROs to Ethernet as
[01:59:37.720 --> 01:59:38.720]   well.
[01:59:38.720 --> 01:59:40.200]   It's smart enough to know exactly what to do.
[01:59:40.200 --> 01:59:41.200]   It's not just repeaters.
[01:59:41.200 --> 01:59:42.200]   This is a mesh network.
[01:59:42.200 --> 01:59:43.520]   In fact, they just introduced something.
[01:59:43.520 --> 01:59:51.280]   They're calling TrueMesh an even better wireless mesh technology, which makes the ERO network
[01:59:51.280 --> 01:59:52.280]   even better.
[01:59:52.280 --> 01:59:57.440]   Within the house, no matter how far away you are from the base unit, you're going to have
[01:59:57.440 --> 02:00:00.760]   the fastest networking possible.
[02:00:00.760 --> 02:00:04.080]   ERO users will see, if you already have an ERO, you get updated automatically up to two
[02:00:04.080 --> 02:00:05.880]   times the land speed between EROs.
[02:00:05.880 --> 02:00:12.080]   That means if you're in your network, you're going to get HD 4K quality in many cases,
[02:00:12.080 --> 02:00:16.640]   depending on your Internet service provider, but that's going to be the bottleneck on your
[02:00:16.640 --> 02:00:17.640]   network.
[02:00:17.640 --> 02:00:19.920]   I really love these ERO systems.
[02:00:19.920 --> 02:00:25.360]   What is so important with any network router, and it's unfortunately not true of most, this
[02:00:25.360 --> 02:00:26.680]   has got to be updateable.
[02:00:26.680 --> 02:00:28.760]   And ERO updates on average about every week.
[02:00:28.760 --> 02:00:32.500]   In fact, you're going to automatically get the new ERO software in TrueMesh because it
[02:00:32.500 --> 02:00:33.660]   just updates all the time.
[02:00:33.660 --> 02:00:35.600]   It's always looking at your network.
[02:00:35.600 --> 02:00:39.840]   It's always optimizing for what you have, the devices.
[02:00:39.840 --> 02:00:41.600]   It has some really nice features.
[02:00:41.600 --> 02:00:46.680]   For instance, I can assign all the devices in the house to our teenager that he uses,
[02:00:46.680 --> 02:00:53.280]   and then I can go to the Amazon Echo and say, "Pause Michael's Internet."
[02:00:53.280 --> 02:00:54.280]   That is...
[02:00:54.280 --> 02:00:55.760]   Oh, and I love the howl.
[02:00:55.760 --> 02:00:57.520]   Hey, the Internet's down.
[02:00:57.520 --> 02:00:59.000]   Yes, it is, Michael.
[02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:00.000]   Yes, it is.
[02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:03.920]   That is so awesome.
[02:01:03.920 --> 02:01:09.120]   You can even use this because ERO, because it has the mesh network and it kind of can
[02:01:09.120 --> 02:01:11.560]   triangulate where your devices are.
[02:01:11.560 --> 02:01:13.280]   You can say, "Hey, ERO, where's my phone?"
[02:01:13.280 --> 02:01:14.280]   It will give you an...
[02:01:14.280 --> 02:01:16.240]   You can do this on the Alexa or the Echo.
[02:01:16.240 --> 02:01:17.640]   I don't want to say the A word.
[02:01:17.640 --> 02:01:19.200]   You can do this on the Amazon Echo.
[02:01:19.200 --> 02:01:23.400]   You can ask the Echo to find your phone or any device that's on Wi-Fi in your house.
[02:01:23.400 --> 02:01:27.480]   You can have it turn off your ERO LED if it's nighttime and you don't want any blinking
[02:01:27.480 --> 02:01:28.680]   in your bedroom.
[02:01:28.680 --> 02:01:32.440]   Plus, like I said, you can pause.
[02:01:32.440 --> 02:01:34.280]   This is the greatest stuff ever.
[02:01:34.280 --> 02:01:35.280]   No more...
[02:01:35.280 --> 02:01:36.280]   Let's speak.
[02:01:36.280 --> 02:01:37.280]   Every family should have that.
[02:01:37.280 --> 02:01:38.280]   Yes.
[02:01:38.280 --> 02:01:41.800]   Echo, pause, Michael's Internet.
[02:01:41.800 --> 02:01:43.600]   It's awesome.
[02:01:43.600 --> 02:01:48.080]   His iPad, his phone, his computer, they all go offline.
[02:01:48.080 --> 02:01:49.080]   Bedtime.
[02:01:49.080 --> 02:01:51.800]   I love it.
[02:01:51.800 --> 02:01:54.640]   If you go to eer.com, you can learn more.
[02:01:54.640 --> 02:01:55.640]   No more buffering.
[02:01:55.640 --> 02:01:56.840]   No more Zet-Ded Zone.
[02:01:56.840 --> 02:01:59.640]   Super simple to set up.
[02:01:59.640 --> 02:02:00.540]   Anybody can set this up.
[02:02:00.540 --> 02:02:04.840]   This is a good gift for somebody in your family who is not technically savvy but is having trouble
[02:02:04.840 --> 02:02:05.840]   with Wi-Fi.
[02:02:05.840 --> 02:02:06.920]   It really works.
[02:02:06.920 --> 02:02:12.400]   Three overnight shipping if you go to eer.com and use the offer code TWIT.
[02:02:12.400 --> 02:02:14.360]   EERO.com.
[02:02:14.360 --> 02:02:19.840]   I was really skeptical when I first got the ERO and I have to say now I'm stuck.
[02:02:19.840 --> 02:02:22.040]   In fact, I just can't not use the ERO.
[02:02:22.040 --> 02:02:23.040]   I love it.
[02:02:23.040 --> 02:02:26.400]   I want to test other networks, but I just can't.
[02:02:26.400 --> 02:02:27.640]   Sorry.
[02:02:27.640 --> 02:02:30.600]   Even my devices know it's better on ERO.
[02:02:30.600 --> 02:02:35.480]   EERO.com, use the offer code TWIT.
[02:02:35.480 --> 02:02:42.200]   We should really do something cheerful now after this grim two hours talking about how
[02:02:42.200 --> 02:02:44.000]   awful everything is.
[02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:45.960]   Things are okay, right?
[02:02:45.960 --> 02:02:47.200]   The world is a great place.
[02:02:47.200 --> 02:02:48.520]   I'm here with Georgia.
[02:02:48.520 --> 02:02:49.520]   You're here.
[02:02:49.520 --> 02:02:50.520]   That's okay too.
[02:02:50.520 --> 02:02:51.520]   I mean the world is amazing.
[02:02:51.520 --> 02:02:52.520]   That's a dim and amazing place.
[02:02:52.520 --> 02:02:53.520]   I'm okay too.
[02:02:53.520 --> 02:02:54.520]   Look, I made you laugh.
[02:02:54.520 --> 02:02:55.520]   I made Georgia laugh.
[02:02:55.520 --> 02:02:56.520]   Georgia laughs.
[02:02:56.520 --> 02:02:57.520]   She laughed more.
[02:02:57.520 --> 02:02:58.520]   Georgia laughed more.
[02:02:58.520 --> 02:02:59.520]   She laughed a little too hard personally.
[02:02:59.520 --> 02:03:00.520]   I went out.
[02:03:00.520 --> 02:03:01.520]   I said, "I'm a little too hard."
[02:03:01.520 --> 02:03:04.520]   I said, "I'm a little too hard."
[02:03:04.520 --> 02:03:05.520]   Personally, I would.
[02:03:05.520 --> 02:03:07.240]   I'd take a little fence to that.
[02:03:07.240 --> 02:03:08.240]   You played this back later.
[02:03:08.240 --> 02:03:09.520]   You might feel some sort of way.
[02:03:09.520 --> 02:03:14.080]   I'm not going to mention the woman who is facing prosecution even jail time for selling
[02:03:14.080 --> 02:03:16.080]   $12 of Ceviche on Facebook.
[02:03:16.080 --> 02:03:18.840]   I thought you said you were going to make us feel better.
[02:03:18.840 --> 02:03:19.840]   I know.
[02:03:19.840 --> 02:03:20.840]   That's depressing, isn't it?
[02:03:20.840 --> 02:03:23.200]   That's only happy for people that hate Ceviche.
[02:03:23.200 --> 02:03:24.200]   I...
[02:03:24.200 --> 02:03:25.920]   She doesn't do it for money.
[02:03:25.920 --> 02:03:27.880]   She says, "Sometimes I make too much food."
[02:03:27.880 --> 02:03:28.880]   I go to the...
[02:03:28.880 --> 02:03:31.640]   Facebook now has that little neighborhood selling thing.
[02:03:31.640 --> 02:03:34.440]   I say, "Anybody want to see Ceviche?"
[02:03:34.440 --> 02:03:36.360]   So they did a sting.
[02:03:36.360 --> 02:03:39.200]   The city of Stockton, California did a sting.
[02:03:39.200 --> 02:03:40.480]   They sent an inspector over.
[02:03:40.480 --> 02:03:43.880]   He bought her Ceviche and then they arrested her.
[02:03:43.880 --> 02:03:44.880]   That's so ridiculous.
[02:03:44.880 --> 02:03:45.880]   They don't have...
[02:03:45.880 --> 02:03:46.880]   They don't have...
[02:03:46.880 --> 02:03:47.880]   They don't have Ceviche.
[02:03:47.880 --> 02:03:48.880]   They don't have Ceviche.
[02:03:48.880 --> 02:03:49.880]   That's what we know.
[02:03:49.880 --> 02:03:50.880]   And by the way, Stockton is a very dangerous city.
[02:03:50.880 --> 02:03:51.880]   A lot of gun violence.
[02:03:51.880 --> 02:03:54.600]   I was going to say, "Don't do other things to do."
[02:03:54.600 --> 02:03:59.080]   Don't you have something better to do to chase down a mom who is selling Ceviche on Facebook.
[02:03:59.080 --> 02:04:02.680]   I mean, I should warn people because there are people selling food on my Facebook thing,
[02:04:02.680 --> 02:04:03.680]   too.
[02:04:03.680 --> 02:04:04.680]   I see that actually a lot.
[02:04:04.680 --> 02:04:09.440]   It's technically illegal, although there is a...
[02:04:09.440 --> 02:04:14.720]   Because there's lots of groups that have, you know, crab feeds or spaghetti feeds and stuff.
[02:04:14.720 --> 02:04:26.440]   So there actually is a federal law, I think, that allows unlicensed food sales in serious
[02:04:26.440 --> 02:04:27.440]   circumstances.
[02:04:27.440 --> 02:04:30.960]   I've seen people get arrested for giving homeless people food, just giving them food.
[02:04:30.960 --> 02:04:31.960]   Oh, yeah.
[02:04:31.960 --> 02:04:32.960]   Oh, no.
[02:04:32.960 --> 02:04:33.960]   Yeah.
[02:04:33.960 --> 02:04:38.880]   My daughter had a friend, high schooler, had a group that would feed people who were homeless
[02:04:38.880 --> 02:04:39.880]   in Petaluma.
[02:04:39.880 --> 02:04:42.360]   They got shut down.
[02:04:42.360 --> 02:04:44.360]   That's ridiculous.
[02:04:44.360 --> 02:04:49.200]   I hope it's some kind of common sense.
[02:04:49.200 --> 02:04:50.200]   Common sense.
[02:04:50.200 --> 02:04:51.560]   I understand we have to protect people.
[02:04:51.560 --> 02:04:52.560]   It's not a federal law.
[02:04:52.560 --> 02:04:58.800]   I'm sorry, it's a state law, California Cottage Food Law, which says some approved baked products,
[02:04:58.800 --> 02:05:04.280]   including breads, cookies, pasta, confections, can be sold locally with a short training,
[02:05:04.280 --> 02:05:06.080]   home cooks are allowed to sell.
[02:05:06.080 --> 02:05:09.160]   However, Ceviche is not covered because it's made of raw fish.
[02:05:09.160 --> 02:05:16.440]   It's a delicious raw fish cocktail that's cured with vinegar and spices.
[02:05:16.440 --> 02:05:21.360]   What's up, though, with the locking people up for things that really are non-threatening
[02:05:21.360 --> 02:05:22.360]   crimes?
[02:05:22.360 --> 02:05:30.600]   I think we have much better things that we can do if people kind of break a law that's
[02:05:30.600 --> 02:05:31.600]   not actually violent.
[02:05:31.600 --> 02:05:38.800]   You're not making the world any safer by having one woman that if she knew she wasn't supposed
[02:05:38.800 --> 02:05:40.360]   to do it, I'm sure she would have said, okay.
[02:05:40.360 --> 02:05:41.360]   They didn't warn her, right?
[02:05:41.360 --> 02:05:42.360]   They didn't warn her.
[02:05:42.360 --> 02:05:44.520]   They just stung her.
[02:05:44.520 --> 02:05:46.840]   That's why we jail more people than anybody else in the world.
[02:05:46.840 --> 02:05:50.200]   You give her a ticket, if you, at worst case, you give her a ticket and you say, "Don't
[02:05:50.200 --> 02:05:51.200]   do that again."
[02:05:51.200 --> 02:05:52.200]   You give her another ticket.
[02:05:52.200 --> 02:05:53.960]   She's another third time, okay, then maybe.
[02:05:53.960 --> 02:05:54.960]   You find her.
[02:05:54.960 --> 02:05:55.960]   You find her.
[02:05:55.960 --> 02:05:58.640]   People, the thing that people care about most is their pocketbook.
[02:05:58.640 --> 02:06:02.680]   Give them a fine or make them do some community service.
[02:06:02.680 --> 02:06:04.680]   And then that's it.
[02:06:04.680 --> 02:06:05.680]   Done.
[02:06:05.680 --> 02:06:06.680]   I don't know.
[02:06:06.680 --> 02:06:07.680]   I don't understand.
[02:06:07.680 --> 02:06:11.280]   I think that most people that won't get into a prison debate, but anyways, I'll stop.
[02:06:11.280 --> 02:06:12.280]   We'll make it happy.
[02:06:12.280 --> 02:06:13.360]   I'm trying to find good news.
[02:06:13.360 --> 02:06:15.200]   I just can't find any good news in here.
[02:06:15.200 --> 02:06:17.560]   Come on, there's got to be some good news.
[02:06:17.560 --> 02:06:21.840]   I don't feel depressed.
[02:06:21.840 --> 02:06:24.160]   I feel good about technology.
[02:06:24.160 --> 02:06:26.000]   I think we're working on it.
[02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:27.000]   Not everything's perfect.
[02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:33.200]   I think it is that Toyota, that little Toyota robot that's adorable and wants to be loved.
[02:06:33.200 --> 02:06:34.200]   That's happy.
[02:06:34.200 --> 02:06:35.200]   No, bad.
[02:06:35.200 --> 02:06:36.200]   Yeah, cute robot.
[02:06:36.200 --> 02:06:37.200]   Okay.
[02:06:37.200 --> 02:06:38.200]   Okay.
[02:06:38.200 --> 02:06:41.840]   The whole, you know, so like, okay, here's some happy news.
[02:06:41.840 --> 02:06:44.000]   Sal's a goi and got fired at Apple.
[02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:44.920]   So there's happy news.
[02:06:44.920 --> 02:06:47.920]   I love Sal.
[02:06:47.920 --> 02:06:49.240]   Sal is the guy who was the Apple script guy.
[02:06:49.240 --> 02:06:50.840]   We've had him on many, many times.
[02:06:50.840 --> 02:06:55.080]   We did a whole series of podcasts with him on Mac break.
[02:06:55.080 --> 02:06:59.560]   He was responsible for Automator for Apple script.
[02:06:59.560 --> 02:07:02.440]   He was Apple's product manager of automation technologies.
[02:07:02.440 --> 02:07:04.520]   His post is eliminated.
[02:07:04.520 --> 02:07:06.720]   And so he's going to consult and stuff like that.
[02:07:06.720 --> 02:07:07.720]   Love you, Sal.
[02:07:07.720 --> 02:07:09.240]   I'm sorry to hear that.
[02:07:09.240 --> 02:07:10.920]   I kind of saw the writing on the wall.
[02:07:10.920 --> 02:07:16.760]   This is another example of Apple just kind of abandoning a certain category of user that
[02:07:16.760 --> 02:07:21.040]   wants to do more than just kind of browse and have a lovely computer.
[02:07:21.040 --> 02:07:25.520]   Do we talk about the FCC, Kevin, on our public in demands?
[02:07:25.520 --> 02:07:31.480]   Yeah, the FCC says, all right, we're not going to do anything until after the inauguration
[02:07:31.480 --> 02:07:32.480]   day.
[02:07:32.480 --> 02:07:35.200]   That stuff that people don't think about, like when I tell people it's going to be okay,
[02:07:35.200 --> 02:07:37.040]   it's not a big deal stuff like that.
[02:07:37.040 --> 02:07:38.280]   It's kind of a big deal.
[02:07:38.280 --> 02:07:40.560]   I think this is unprecedented, though.
[02:07:40.560 --> 02:07:45.640]   Doesn't this happen every every year, four years where if you have a lame duck president,
[02:07:45.640 --> 02:07:48.240]   they just kind of say, okay, we're not going to do much for the next couple of months.
[02:07:48.240 --> 02:07:49.880]   We're just going to let them do that.
[02:07:49.880 --> 02:07:50.880]   They do do that.
[02:07:50.880 --> 02:07:54.360]   But I mean, for us, especially in the bubble, some of the things that he was trying to
[02:07:54.360 --> 02:07:55.360]   get through the FCC.
[02:07:55.360 --> 02:07:56.360]   I agree.
[02:07:56.360 --> 02:07:57.360]   I agree.
[02:07:57.360 --> 02:07:58.360]   I agree.
[02:07:58.360 --> 02:08:02.320]   Like they started out and started out and started out and finally, like, yeah, we'll do it next
[02:08:02.320 --> 02:08:03.320]   week.
[02:08:03.320 --> 02:08:04.600]   And now they just put this rule that we're like, no.
[02:08:04.600 --> 02:08:05.600]   Yeah.
[02:08:05.600 --> 02:08:10.000]   My goodness, like he was trying to do some really good stuff that I don't think is going
[02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:11.920]   to get pushed forward.
[02:08:11.920 --> 02:08:13.160]   So we'll see what happens.
[02:08:13.160 --> 02:08:18.880]   Tom Wheeler, who was the chairman of the FCC, a Republican, might point out, a bomb, a point
[02:08:18.880 --> 02:08:19.880]   but a Republican.
[02:08:19.880 --> 02:08:22.240]   And in fact, we thought he was going to be terrible.
[02:08:22.240 --> 02:08:27.840]   John Oliver said it was like letting your baby having a dingo babysit your baby.
[02:08:27.840 --> 02:08:31.440]   But he called him a dingo, but then he had to take it back because Tom Wheeler, even though
[02:08:31.440 --> 02:08:38.040]   he had been a lobbyist for the cable industry and the telcos, turned out to be our best friend.
[02:08:38.040 --> 02:08:39.920]   He knew the inside trade of it.
[02:08:39.920 --> 02:08:42.800]   So I mean, that's why I said, give some people a chance.
[02:08:42.800 --> 02:08:45.600]   Give them enough rope to hang theirself and maybe they'll swing across and make the gap.
[02:08:45.600 --> 02:08:46.600]   I don't know.
[02:08:46.600 --> 02:08:47.600]   Yeah.
[02:08:47.600 --> 02:08:49.440]   But that's kind of crappy for us.
[02:08:49.440 --> 02:08:51.000]   I just can't come on.
[02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:52.000]   Something good.
[02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:53.000]   Happy story.
[02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:54.000]   Happy, happy, happy.
[02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:58.000]   We are talking about the happy stuff.
[02:08:58.000 --> 02:08:59.000]   Screw it.
[02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:05.040]   I hate to leave people with it.
[02:09:05.040 --> 02:09:08.760]   The one happy story was that Metallica is now in Napster.
[02:09:08.760 --> 02:09:09.760]   That's it.
[02:09:09.760 --> 02:09:10.760]   Yeah.
[02:09:10.760 --> 02:09:14.760]   I mean, somebody in the chat and people tweeted me that we were too nice about Apple and
[02:09:14.760 --> 02:09:15.760]   I thought we got to Apple.
[02:09:15.760 --> 02:09:16.760]   I don't think we're that nice.
[02:09:16.760 --> 02:09:23.480]   I want to start a campaign though that everybody stopped buying stuff that doesn't have a replaceable
[02:09:23.480 --> 02:09:24.480]   battery.
[02:09:24.480 --> 02:09:25.480]   It's good for you.
[02:09:25.480 --> 02:09:26.480]   That's never.
[02:09:26.480 --> 02:09:27.480]   Yeah.
[02:09:27.480 --> 02:09:28.480]   You could try that.
[02:09:28.480 --> 02:09:29.480]   It's never happening.
[02:09:29.480 --> 02:09:30.480]   Yeah.
[02:09:30.480 --> 02:09:34.320]   Well, Samsung doesn't, but their phones are blowing up.
[02:09:34.320 --> 02:09:38.880]   We have to, you're the right, but I think that people love their technology and how light
[02:09:38.880 --> 02:09:39.880]   it is.
[02:09:39.880 --> 02:09:44.160]   And when they're carrying around a heavy laptop, they're going to be like, you know what?
[02:09:44.160 --> 02:09:45.400]   It's big and cumbersome.
[02:09:45.400 --> 02:09:49.160]   Unfortunately, we're used to it now.
[02:09:49.160 --> 02:09:50.160]   We've already drank the Kool-Aid.
[02:09:50.160 --> 02:09:54.760]   Now we want light and portable and it's hard to go back afterwards, even if it's better
[02:09:54.760 --> 02:09:55.760]   for us.
[02:09:55.760 --> 02:10:01.120]   We want to find it to be able to light and portable and be able to be recyclable.
[02:10:01.120 --> 02:10:02.280]   That's what we need to do.
[02:10:02.280 --> 02:10:03.280]   I know.
[02:10:03.280 --> 02:10:06.480]   Here's happy news.
[02:10:06.480 --> 02:10:08.640]   If you were a fan of Top Gear.
[02:10:08.640 --> 02:10:10.080]   Oh, that's true.
[02:10:10.080 --> 02:10:12.200]   The Grand Tour.
[02:10:12.200 --> 02:10:13.200]   Did you watch it?
[02:10:13.200 --> 02:10:14.200]   I didn't.
[02:10:14.200 --> 02:10:15.680]   I'm saving it.
[02:10:15.680 --> 02:10:21.560]   Jeremy Clarkson, who of course was fired after punching a producer on Top Gear.
[02:10:21.560 --> 02:10:27.160]   Richard Hammond and James May are back and they've created a show not just about cars,
[02:10:27.160 --> 02:10:30.440]   but about adventure excitement friendship.
[02:10:30.440 --> 02:10:33.880]   And it is a Amazon original free on Prime.
[02:10:33.880 --> 02:10:36.400]   I really, I want to, I don't want to violate copyright.
[02:10:36.400 --> 02:10:37.400]   Yeah, good.
[02:10:37.400 --> 02:10:38.400]   I can't.
[02:10:38.400 --> 02:10:40.160]   They're stopping me because of a digital rights error.
[02:10:40.160 --> 02:10:42.880]   But I want, you got to watch the beginning.
[02:10:42.880 --> 02:10:48.960]   The beginning segment, five minutes involves Clarkson getting on a plane from England, flying
[02:10:48.960 --> 02:10:53.120]   the United States, renting a Mustang and then his two buddy's show up.
[02:10:53.120 --> 02:10:54.120]   He has a, what is he?
[02:10:54.120 --> 02:10:57.000]   He have a red Mustang and then they show up in a blue and white Mustang and they're three
[02:10:57.000 --> 02:10:59.680]   red, white and blue Mustangs basically goes somewhere.
[02:10:59.680 --> 02:11:04.040]   It looks like Burning Man in the California desert and they've got this big thing.
[02:11:04.040 --> 02:11:12.080]   This five minute beginning sequence cost Amazon three million dollars and it was worth every
[02:11:12.080 --> 02:11:13.080]   penny.
[02:11:13.080 --> 02:11:14.080]   Wow.
[02:11:14.080 --> 02:11:15.680]   It's, it was, I saw it.
[02:11:15.680 --> 02:11:16.680]   It was pretty good.
[02:11:16.680 --> 02:11:19.720]   It needs to be a little bit tightened up for other people that have seen it.
[02:11:19.720 --> 02:11:21.440]   There's a scene in the middle.
[02:11:21.440 --> 02:11:24.440]   Everyone will know what it is that went on for too long and it was like, why are you
[02:11:24.440 --> 02:11:25.440]   doing that?
[02:11:25.440 --> 02:11:29.640]   There's a scene in the middle where everyone's like, you know, my, my little eight year
[02:11:29.640 --> 02:11:31.800]   old went, why do they keep doing this?
[02:11:31.800 --> 02:11:32.800]   That's not funny.
[02:11:32.800 --> 02:11:33.800]   Stop it.
[02:11:33.800 --> 02:11:34.800]   Stop it.
[02:11:34.800 --> 02:11:40.800]   So that piece of there, but the, the camera shots are glorious and it still has that top
[02:11:40.800 --> 02:11:43.400]   gear atmosphere and the camaraderie between them.
[02:11:43.400 --> 02:11:44.400]   That's just so great.
[02:11:44.400 --> 02:11:48.400]   People are going to be really happy with it, but don't, I hope they don't do the middle
[02:11:48.400 --> 02:11:49.400]   scene.
[02:11:49.400 --> 02:11:50.680]   You know it with the plane.
[02:11:50.680 --> 02:11:51.680]   I'm just going to say that.
[02:11:51.680 --> 02:11:52.680]   There we go.
[02:11:52.680 --> 02:11:53.680]   We haven't seen it yet.
[02:11:53.680 --> 02:11:55.680]   I'm going to watch it, but man.
[02:11:55.680 --> 02:11:59.400]   Well, you know, it's always been a little over the top, right?
[02:11:59.400 --> 02:12:00.400]   It's kind of fun.
[02:12:00.400 --> 02:12:01.400]   Kind of fun, right?
[02:12:01.400 --> 02:12:02.400]   Yeah.
[02:12:02.400 --> 02:12:03.400]   Yeah.
[02:12:03.400 --> 02:12:04.400]   Yeah.
[02:12:04.400 --> 02:12:05.400]   Yeah.
[02:12:05.400 --> 02:12:06.400]   That's really cool.
[02:12:06.400 --> 02:12:07.400]   So there you go.
[02:12:07.400 --> 02:12:08.400]   That's happy.
[02:12:08.400 --> 02:12:09.400]   Yeah.
[02:12:09.400 --> 02:12:10.400]   Yeah.
[02:12:10.400 --> 02:12:11.400]   Yeah.
[02:12:11.400 --> 02:12:12.400]   Yeah.
[02:12:12.400 --> 02:12:13.400]   Yeah.
[02:12:13.400 --> 02:12:14.400]   That's happy.
[02:12:14.400 --> 02:12:15.400]   That's happy.
[02:12:15.400 --> 02:12:19.760]   Twitter suspended a whole bunch of alt-right things.
[02:12:19.760 --> 02:12:20.760]   I was happy.
[02:12:20.760 --> 02:12:21.760]   That was good.
[02:12:21.760 --> 02:12:22.760]   Yeah.
[02:12:22.760 --> 02:12:24.760]   I don't know what to think about that only because.
[02:12:24.760 --> 02:12:26.520]   Are you free speech?
[02:12:26.520 --> 02:12:28.400]   No, and alt-right's disgusting.
[02:12:28.400 --> 02:12:30.560]   In fact, I don't even want to use the world alt-right.
[02:12:30.560 --> 02:12:31.640]   Let's just call them what they are.
[02:12:31.640 --> 02:12:32.640]   White supremacists.
[02:12:32.640 --> 02:12:33.640]   Yeah.
[02:12:33.640 --> 02:12:34.640]   Yeah.
[02:12:34.640 --> 02:12:39.880]   We have laws in Canada against hate speech for anyone against anyone.
[02:12:39.880 --> 02:12:42.600]   Do we have laws in the US against hate speech?
[02:12:42.600 --> 02:12:45.240]   I don't feel like we might not.
[02:12:45.240 --> 02:12:50.720]   We do, like technically speaking, when someone does something that's over the realm of free
[02:12:50.720 --> 02:12:55.120]   speech when they're threatening or they're sparingly in a certain way.
[02:12:55.120 --> 02:12:56.120]   Yeah.
[02:12:56.120 --> 02:12:57.560]   If you threaten bodily harm.
[02:12:57.560 --> 02:12:58.560]   Yeah.
[02:12:58.560 --> 02:13:03.680]   There's like a system set in place where there's certain triggers where it comes into
[02:13:03.680 --> 02:13:05.160]   not being free speech anymore.
[02:13:05.160 --> 02:13:06.160]   Right.
[02:13:06.160 --> 02:13:10.600]   So we do have them, but again, it's like a catch-22 of people that are really smart, dance that
[02:13:10.600 --> 02:13:12.120]   line like nobody's business.
[02:13:12.120 --> 02:13:13.120]   Yeah.
[02:13:13.120 --> 02:13:14.120]   To play that game.
[02:13:14.120 --> 02:13:17.160]   That's why I feel like, yeah, I'm glad that they kick these guys off.
[02:13:17.160 --> 02:13:18.160]   It's not going to hurt them.
[02:13:18.160 --> 02:13:22.200]   In fact, it gives them notoriety as it did with Milo Yiannopoulos.
[02:13:22.200 --> 02:13:25.760]   But there's so many other hateful things on Twitter.
[02:13:25.760 --> 02:13:26.760]   Yeah.
[02:13:26.760 --> 02:13:27.760]   It's like, I don't know.
[02:13:27.760 --> 02:13:30.400]   It's a drop in the bucket, I guess.
[02:13:30.400 --> 02:13:33.880]   It's, these are doing something because for a long time they weren't doing enough for anything.
[02:13:33.880 --> 02:13:34.880]   Yeah.
[02:13:34.880 --> 02:13:36.400]   And so, at least they're making efforts.
[02:13:36.400 --> 02:13:37.400]   Yeah.
[02:13:37.400 --> 02:13:42.800]   Like they have a new tool that, Moot tools and they're saying it's easier to report people
[02:13:42.800 --> 02:13:43.880]   and stuff like that.
[02:13:43.880 --> 02:13:44.880]   We need Twitter.
[02:13:44.880 --> 02:13:49.960]   In fact, a great article from Ben Thompson who has been on this show many times and writes
[02:13:49.960 --> 02:13:50.960]   great stuff.
[02:13:50.960 --> 02:13:54.000]   Why we've got to save Twitter?
[02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:59.160]   And it may not, maybe the best way to save Twitter is not to let it continue as a private
[02:13:59.160 --> 02:14:04.720]   company run by these guys who don't really seem to be doing a good job as stewards of
[02:14:04.720 --> 02:14:05.920]   Twitter.
[02:14:05.920 --> 02:14:13.000]   But maybe there's some way, he says, why Twitter must be saved.
[02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:17.400]   And let me see if I can find the money quote here.
[02:14:17.400 --> 02:14:19.800]   I didn't read that, but I believe that with all my heart.
[02:14:19.800 --> 02:14:20.800]   Yeah.
[02:14:20.800 --> 02:14:25.000]   The world, like people that complain about Twitter or think Twitter's not useful.
[02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:26.960]   When Twitter's gone, you will feel it.
[02:14:26.960 --> 02:14:29.280]   Like you will feel it.
[02:14:29.280 --> 02:14:32.080]   It is the communication of the world and speed and time.
[02:14:32.080 --> 02:14:35.320]   And there are certain times maybe their numbers aren't as big and maybe they're not growing
[02:14:35.320 --> 02:14:41.120]   away they're supposed to grow, but it is a necessity and a way of life, especially for
[02:14:41.120 --> 02:14:45.480]   people that unserved markets and areas like, I don't know what we would do without Twitter.
[02:14:45.480 --> 02:14:46.480]   I really don't.
[02:14:46.480 --> 02:14:49.200]   Well, and the fake news problem didn't is less of a problem on Twitter, not because
[02:14:49.200 --> 02:14:53.720]   there's lots of fake news on Twitter, but people respond immediately.
[02:14:53.720 --> 02:14:58.960]   So there is this kind of because it's kind of a live fee, this natural tendency to move
[02:14:58.960 --> 02:15:01.800]   towards correct information.
[02:15:01.800 --> 02:15:09.560]   But he quotes in this Justice Lewis Brandeis from the Supreme Court, "The greatest menace
[02:15:09.560 --> 02:15:12.720]   to freedom is an inert people.
[02:15:12.720 --> 02:15:18.560]   Political discussion is a political duty and that this should be fundamental principle
[02:15:18.560 --> 02:15:21.400]   of American government."
[02:15:21.400 --> 02:15:25.840]   And that's where, according to Ben and I agree, the discussion is happening these days
[02:15:25.840 --> 02:15:28.560]   and we need to have that conversation.
[02:15:28.560 --> 02:15:29.560]   So maybe...
[02:15:29.560 --> 02:15:35.800]   You know what the problem with the problem with most social media is that it's not actually
[02:15:35.800 --> 02:15:38.840]   a discussion among people that have different views.
[02:15:38.840 --> 02:15:41.480]   You follow people that follow similar views to you.
[02:15:41.480 --> 02:15:45.880]   We're usually inclined to like people better, that have similar views to us.
[02:15:45.880 --> 02:15:49.520]   We don't really want discourse with people of opposing views.
[02:15:49.520 --> 02:15:54.560]   And Twitter is a huge microcosm of that, that most of the people that you send something
[02:15:54.560 --> 02:15:58.120]   out that's slightly political, you'll notice your follower levels of people that believe
[02:15:58.120 --> 02:16:01.920]   different things will actually drop off because they don't want to hear that.
[02:16:01.920 --> 02:16:04.280]   And so it's not really dealing with discourse.
[02:16:04.280 --> 02:16:07.880]   It's a whole bunch of people banding together that are in the same in group.
[02:16:07.880 --> 02:16:12.080]   And so we need to have more discourse with people with differing views and we need to
[02:16:12.080 --> 02:16:15.000]   learn that people that think different things than you are okay.
[02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:17.320]   It's okay to believe different things.
[02:16:17.320 --> 02:16:18.320]   That's how we grow.
[02:16:18.320 --> 02:16:23.600]   We need to have differing parties or political stances to battle each other, to keep each
[02:16:23.600 --> 02:16:27.560]   other in check and that's where the strength in a democracy really lies.
[02:16:27.560 --> 02:16:30.880]   And we're starting to become more of in group people.
[02:16:30.880 --> 02:16:34.400]   And so discussions on Twitter are usually with your own people and you're not really
[02:16:34.400 --> 02:16:37.480]   bringing out the news of a differing view to many people.
[02:16:37.480 --> 02:16:38.480]   >> Yeah.
[02:16:38.480 --> 02:16:43.760]   In a positive light, there are, yes, echo chambers all around, all the internet.
[02:16:43.760 --> 02:16:49.400]   But there have been many a time where someone has said something to me and 140 characters,
[02:16:49.400 --> 02:16:53.520]   I flipped their whole mindset around because I actually took the time and said something
[02:16:53.520 --> 02:16:54.760]   to them directly.
[02:16:54.760 --> 02:16:58.960]   So yes, it does happen occasionally, it needs to happen more.
[02:16:58.960 --> 02:17:03.360]   But I'm very happy with the fact that a lot of times people say something to me.
[02:17:03.360 --> 02:17:04.760]   Why would you say that?
[02:17:04.760 --> 02:17:09.240]   And I say, and they're like, here's, I never thought of it that way.
[02:17:09.240 --> 02:17:10.240]   And it does happen.
[02:17:10.240 --> 02:17:12.280]   We need to have more of that happen with more people.
[02:17:12.280 --> 02:17:13.880]   But I love getting out of my echo chamber.
[02:17:13.880 --> 02:17:14.880]   I want to be in everybody's chamber.
[02:17:14.880 --> 02:17:16.040]   >> But that's up to you.
[02:17:16.040 --> 02:17:20.000]   And I think that that's the point is that Twitter gives you the option if you want to
[02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:22.280]   hear from other people to see other views.
[02:17:22.280 --> 02:17:28.760]   And everybody should take that opportunity to broaden your Twitter feed, to find people
[02:17:28.760 --> 02:17:33.240]   with opposing viewpoints, not even necessarily to engage them just to see what the conversation
[02:17:33.240 --> 02:17:34.240]   is.
[02:17:34.240 --> 02:17:35.720]   And so that's to me, that's the real point.
[02:17:35.720 --> 02:17:36.720]   Yes, you're right.
[02:17:36.720 --> 02:17:38.200]   You could be in a filter bubble.
[02:17:38.200 --> 02:17:43.120]   But Twitter and the internet give you the tools to expand beyond that in a way we've never
[02:17:43.120 --> 02:17:46.720]   had before to hear as many voices as you're willing to hear.
[02:17:46.720 --> 02:17:47.720]   And that's the opportunity.
[02:17:47.720 --> 02:17:49.760]   And I think we need to take advantage of that opportunity.
[02:17:49.760 --> 02:17:50.760]   That's why we're- >> Which is great.
[02:17:50.760 --> 02:17:53.800]   But unfortunately, I think that one piece to Twitter, and I like Twitter.
[02:17:53.800 --> 02:17:54.800]   I use Twitter.
[02:17:54.800 --> 02:17:57.400]   It's one of the few sets of social media that I actually use.
[02:17:57.400 --> 02:17:59.160]   So I do like Twitter.
[02:17:59.160 --> 02:18:04.760]   But the problem is is that Twitter, you end up getting the people that speak the loudest
[02:18:04.760 --> 02:18:08.800]   and are the most polarizing, get the most followers from that and get retweeted more
[02:18:08.800 --> 02:18:09.960]   often.
[02:18:09.960 --> 02:18:14.280]   And if you actually want to change people's views, you need a moderate discussion.
[02:18:14.280 --> 02:18:17.480]   Like what you said is that you spoke to someone directly.
[02:18:17.480 --> 02:18:20.800]   You came from the place where they were at and you were able to make them think, you
[02:18:20.800 --> 02:18:23.000]   know what, maybe I was wrong about what I was dealing with.
[02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:27.880]   If you have someone that has a vastly opposing view, it doesn't actually help you change
[02:18:27.880 --> 02:18:28.880]   your mind.
[02:18:28.880 --> 02:18:32.640]   It actually usually reinforces your own belief of why that person is wrong.
[02:18:32.640 --> 02:18:39.560]   And so we need to have also moderate discourse instead of having really angry, reactive reactions
[02:18:39.560 --> 02:18:45.520]   and Twitter and much of social media reinforces and rewards people that are highly reactive
[02:18:45.520 --> 02:18:47.040]   and really angry.
[02:18:47.040 --> 02:18:49.600]   And that actually caused people to be polarized against it.
[02:18:49.600 --> 02:18:55.200]   So I think that we need to have moderate discussions about things of, you know, we're
[02:18:55.200 --> 02:18:58.840]   not so far apart as we think that we are.
[02:18:58.840 --> 02:18:59.840]   Yeah.
[02:18:59.840 --> 02:19:01.760]   I was just about to fake argue with you about that.
[02:19:01.760 --> 02:19:02.760]   But I love you so much.
[02:19:02.760 --> 02:19:03.760]   I couldn't do it.
[02:19:03.760 --> 02:19:07.400]   So I said, you don't know what you're talking about.
[02:19:07.400 --> 02:19:09.120]   Blah, blah, blah, blah.
[02:19:09.120 --> 02:19:10.120]   And then I couldn't do it.
[02:19:10.120 --> 02:19:11.120]   I said it.
[02:19:11.120 --> 02:19:12.120]   It would have been hilarious though.
[02:19:12.120 --> 02:19:13.920]   That would have been, I tried.
[02:19:13.920 --> 02:19:14.920]   I really tried in my mind.
[02:19:14.920 --> 02:19:16.720]   I was like, you should have done it.
[02:19:16.720 --> 02:19:17.720]   You should have done it.
[02:19:17.720 --> 02:19:18.720]   That would have been great.
[02:19:18.720 --> 02:19:24.000]   Ladies and gentlemen, we have come to the concluding moments of this fine program.
[02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:29.880]   Thanks once again to Barrett Thirston for joining us to Georgia Dow of iMore.com.
[02:19:29.880 --> 02:19:32.040]   It's always a pleasure to have you on the show.
[02:19:32.040 --> 02:19:34.880]   You're the voice of reason.
[02:19:34.880 --> 02:19:36.480]   And I like that.
[02:19:36.480 --> 02:19:43.080]   And of course, you can find her videos about anxiety and depression and sleep at anxiety-videos.com.
[02:19:43.080 --> 02:19:46.360]   I want to give you a big plug for that because that's a great work.
[02:19:46.360 --> 02:19:47.360]   Talk to you there.
[02:19:47.360 --> 02:19:49.880]   Thank you for being here.
[02:19:49.880 --> 02:19:52.320]   Also thank you to Owen, JJ Stone.
[02:19:52.320 --> 02:19:54.480]   We call him O-Doctor for reasons no one knows.
[02:19:54.480 --> 02:19:56.080]   But maybe that's because his Twitter handle.
[02:19:56.080 --> 02:19:57.320]   I don't know.
[02:19:57.320 --> 02:19:59.280]   It might be my Twitter handle.
[02:19:59.280 --> 02:20:02.800]   If you listen to this and you haven't had enough of politics and me talking about, I
[02:20:02.800 --> 02:20:06.040]   did a podcast on Facebook, Paul Ticket, where I ramble and rain about stuff.
[02:20:06.040 --> 02:20:10.800]   And then like I said earlier, I did a podcast with a French guy, a German guy, a guy from
[02:20:10.800 --> 02:20:11.800]   South Africa.
[02:20:11.800 --> 02:20:12.800]   What was that show?
[02:20:12.800 --> 02:20:13.800]   I want to hear that.
[02:20:13.800 --> 02:20:14.800]   It's the French spin.
[02:20:14.800 --> 02:20:19.160]   It's on IKMZ in my Facebook, politics, and posts.
[02:20:19.160 --> 02:20:21.080]   I link to it so you can get to it.
[02:20:21.080 --> 02:20:23.160]   But they talk about some of my changing your mind.
[02:20:23.160 --> 02:20:24.960]   This is Patrick Beajus show.
[02:20:24.960 --> 02:20:25.960]   I know this show.
[02:20:25.960 --> 02:20:26.960]   Yes.
[02:20:26.960 --> 02:20:27.960]   Yes.
[02:20:27.960 --> 02:20:28.960]   Patrick's been on many times.
[02:20:28.960 --> 02:20:29.960]   Great guy.
[02:20:29.960 --> 02:20:30.960]   Great guy.
[02:20:30.960 --> 02:20:33.440]   And again, talk about it out of my ecosystem.
[02:20:33.440 --> 02:20:37.080]   They were talking about how America is helping the world and what they're supposed to do.
[02:20:37.080 --> 02:20:39.920]   And I'm in the mentality of I'm tired of being everybody's big brother.
[02:20:39.920 --> 02:20:42.800]   I'm tired of super duper socialism where we just give away all this money and we got
[02:20:42.800 --> 02:20:44.720]   poor people in America.
[02:20:44.720 --> 02:20:47.840]   And their mind all over the country, all over the world, they were like, "Look bro, we need
[02:20:47.840 --> 02:20:48.840]   you.
[02:20:48.840 --> 02:20:50.840]   We need that stuff that y'all are doing for us."
[02:20:50.840 --> 02:20:53.640]   And they gave very rational points to it where it changed my mind.
[02:20:53.640 --> 02:20:57.800]   I guess we can't stop being the world's big brother because we have a responsibility that
[02:20:57.800 --> 02:20:59.920]   I wish that we didn't have, but we do.
[02:20:59.920 --> 02:21:03.720]   So it's always great to get outside of yourself and listen to other people.
[02:21:03.720 --> 02:21:07.560]   That's why I come on the show and learn something from Uncle Leo occasionally teaching them
[02:21:07.560 --> 02:21:08.560]   stuff.
[02:21:08.560 --> 02:21:11.440]   And of course, anytime they tell me George is on, I gots to be here.
[02:21:11.440 --> 02:21:13.440]   Because I can't leave her alone.
[02:21:13.440 --> 02:21:18.880]   The Phileas Club is the podcast episode 78, Frenchspend.com, Patrick Bechas, excellent
[02:21:18.880 --> 02:21:20.360]   podcast.
[02:21:20.360 --> 02:21:21.440]   That would be well worth listening to.
[02:21:21.440 --> 02:21:24.200]   I will make a point of it on the way home.
[02:21:24.200 --> 02:21:26.320]   Thank you all for joining us.
[02:21:26.320 --> 02:21:27.320]   Wow.
[02:21:27.320 --> 02:21:28.840]   I was a little worried about the show.
[02:21:28.840 --> 02:21:30.520]   I ended up being really, really good.
[02:21:30.520 --> 02:21:33.000]   Was it because of me that you were worried?
[02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:34.000]   No.
[02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:36.400]   You were the only person I wasn't worried about.
[02:21:36.400 --> 02:21:37.400]   What?
[02:21:37.400 --> 02:21:38.920]   Oh, what?
[02:21:38.920 --> 02:21:39.920]   Really?
[02:21:39.920 --> 02:21:42.360]   I wish I wasn't worried about you either.
[02:21:42.360 --> 02:21:44.720]   In fact, there really is no reason to worry at all.
[02:21:44.720 --> 02:21:46.720]   There's no reason to worry at all.
[02:21:46.720 --> 02:21:49.080]   I can't compare it to a day.
[02:21:49.080 --> 02:21:50.080]   We got Georgia.
[02:21:50.080 --> 02:21:52.480]   I know everything because I'm a real doctor.
[02:21:52.480 --> 02:21:54.240]   I'm not a real doctor.
[02:21:54.240 --> 02:21:55.240]   I know.
[02:21:55.240 --> 02:21:57.800]   I'm just saying that because everybody else says that when you're with me, you get to
[02:21:57.800 --> 02:21:59.960]   be the real doctor and I'm a fake doctor.
[02:21:59.960 --> 02:22:01.680]   I'm just as real as you.
[02:22:01.680 --> 02:22:02.680]   Okay.
[02:22:02.680 --> 02:22:03.680]   George is real.
[02:22:03.680 --> 02:22:05.240]   Can you pinch his hand?
[02:22:05.240 --> 02:22:07.640]   Pinchowin and he yells.
[02:22:07.640 --> 02:22:08.640]   That's what.
[02:22:08.640 --> 02:22:11.320]   Leo, I got one thing to say that most people don't usually get to say.
[02:22:11.320 --> 02:22:12.320]   You know what it is?
[02:22:12.320 --> 02:22:14.520]   Another twit is in the cane.
[02:22:15.520 --> 02:22:16.520]   It's amazing.
[02:22:16.520 --> 02:22:18.520]   And on that note, goodbye.
[02:22:18.520 --> 02:22:19.520]   Do it the twit.
[02:22:19.520 --> 02:22:20.520]   All right.
[02:22:20.520 --> 02:22:21.520]   Do it the twit, baby.
[02:22:21.520 --> 02:22:22.520]   Do it the twit.
[02:22:22.520 --> 02:22:23.520]   All right.
[02:22:23.520 --> 02:22:24.520]   Do it the twit.
