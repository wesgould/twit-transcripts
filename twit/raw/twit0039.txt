[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   This is Twit, this weekend tech, episode 39 for January 22nd, 2006.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   [Music]
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   This is Twit, this weekend tech.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   [Laughter]
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   This is not it.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   Episode 39, I don't care, I'm going full steam ahead.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   Episode 39, the Jack Benny episode for January 22nd, 2005.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   Welcome to This Week in Tech.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   It's a brand new show.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   What would that stand?
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   It's a tap, tap, tap, tap.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   Tap, tap, tap, tap.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   Water touches is where the show's starting.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   It's due to 2006.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   John C. Du-- did I say 2005?
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   Yes.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   I am such a loser.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   John C. DuVorac is here.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   Somebody told me here the Howard Co-Cell of this show.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   I got to tell you, I never played the game.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   That was my Co-Cell voice.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   I can do a Co-Cell, but I have to think about it.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   So, the reason you're screwing up the beginning here is because of the stuff you're drinking.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   Why don't you tell people what it is?
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   Our new sponsor, Absolute Vodka.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   No, it's alkaline water.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   Yeah.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   And you're getting dingier by the minute.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   I'm getting dingier.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   Whoo, it's good for you.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   Let me introduce David Prager is here.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   Greetings.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   From Revision3.com.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   At the moment.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   No, yeah, absolutely.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   Anything you want to tell?
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   I was trying to be a little more interesting.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   Standing in for Kevin Rose.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   Yeah.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   Kevin's just sitting in his room.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   What's he wearing?
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   He's doing dig.com meetings because J. Adelson's in town and they've got a lot of dig stuff
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   to do.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   They're digging around, apparently.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   They're going to meet with the people.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   He's getting a lot of press.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   The Wall Street Journal is a story big story.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   Yeah.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   Does it count if it's a Wall Street Journal online?
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   Is that the same as Google?
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   No.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   No.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   Speaking of the Wall Street Journal, Greg Zachary is here, a former Wall Street Journal writer.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.960]   He wrote some great books, including Showstopper, which I loved about the Windows NT project.
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:05.960]   He's now with Business 2.0.
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.280]   Greg's going to have you on a good evening on the Twit panel.
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.280]   Thank you for having me.
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.920]   Never before been a Twit.
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:12.920]   Don't worry.
[00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:13.920]   It comes easy.
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:14.920]   Believe me.
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:15.920]   It's the TEPT part that's going to be tough.
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:16.920]   TEPT.
[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:17.920]   Yeah.
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:18.920]   That's going to be tough.
[00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:19.920]   Roger Chang from...
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:20.920]   From nowhere.
[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:21.920]   From Jack Yard.
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:22.920]   Oh, back yard.
[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:23.920]   Jack Yard.
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.760]   This is a freebie from a wrestling event I went through.
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.440]   So the unemployed, Roger Chang.
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.440]   Yes.
[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.440]   Representing the unemployed today.
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.440]   Really?
[00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.440]   You're out of work?
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.440]   Yes.
[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.440]   You were talking about this the other day, you were going to quit something you were doing.
[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.440]   Yes.
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.840]   I was driving up here with Roger on the way here.
[00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.680]   He gave me a really interesting reason for why he quit.
[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:40.680]   I don't know if you were about to...
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.680]   You're talking about...
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.040]   One retell part of the reason why he quit, but I thought it was...
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.440]   Because of poor management and bad work ethic?
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.440]   Does that count?
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.440]   No.
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.440]   What's the good story?
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:52.440]   No, that was the story.
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.440]   I just wanted to know if he wanted to tell...
[00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.760]   I just wanted to know if he never told about where he was and what he left and if he was
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:58.760]   while telling you not.
[00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.760]   The story is where you have an exposition.
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.640]   This is just a statement of fact.
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.480]   I also thought I might be able to get a rant at Roger because Roger ran as well.
[00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.080]   I already did in the car.
[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.080]   I'm out.
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.080]   He's talked out.
[00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.080]   Don't let him rant in the car.
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.800]   Save it for the show, don't you?
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:12.800]   There's a certain someone is pregnant.
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:13.800]   I don't get a rant.
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:14.800]   Okay, let's not start there.
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.400]   Coming up in just a little bit, we're going to talk about the plight of the independent
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.880]   ISP, Dane Jasper, our good friend and the president of the California Independent ISP Association
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:23.880]   is here.
[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:24.880]   SISPA.
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:25.880]   Talk about network issues.
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:31.080]   But let's do the top stories of the week before we get too much further.
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.440]   You have an interesting story, John.
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:33.880]   Well, this one here is...
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.240]   I noticed it on our list, which...
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.920]   Should we tell the public that they can access our news list?
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:39.920]   Did you ever do that?
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.920]   Yeah, I don't think I have.
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:42.920]   It's on delicious.
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:43.920]   Yeah.
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:44.920]   It's delicious.
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.520]   You know, the delicious DEL or whatever the heck it is.us/to.
[00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:49.520]   This is the problem with delicious.
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.160]   No one knows where to put the dots.
[00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.160]   Well, you know how to spell...
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.160]   Yeah, well, it's right.
[00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.760]   You have to play with it.
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.760]   It's DEL.ICIO.US.
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.200]   It's the case of being a little too clever.
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.760]   Slash, and there's an RSS feed you can subscribe to.
[00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.280]   Right, and to see what stories are...
[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.000]   New stories that we'll be doing on a weekly basis.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   Some of them.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.720]   We actually only do about what?
[00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:10.720]   Five.
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:11.720]   No, we do more than that.
[00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.680]   There's actually a really neat news site.
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:14.680]   I sent you all invitations.
[00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:15.680]   Did you look at news?
[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:16.680]   I sent you the...
[00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:17.680]   Yeah, I did.
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:18.680]   I saw that.
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.640]   That's another thing you've kind of dug up.
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:25.040]   It's kind of a mixture of dig, delicious, and blogger.
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.040]   Oh, news line.
[00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.040]   News line.
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.040]   Yeah, news line.
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.040]   I've heard of it.
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.040]   Yeah.
[00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.040]   Is that any good?
[00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.040]   It's not public yet.
[00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.040]   It's newsline.com.
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.040]   I just applied this morning so I'm so...
[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.440]   There's a public beta going on.
[00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:36.440]   I like it.
[00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:37.440]   Have you used it?
[00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:38.440]   Have you used it?
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:39.440]   Yeah.
[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:40.440]   Because I tried to get a beta...
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.440]   I sent you an invite.
[00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:42.440]   Maybe you did.
[00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:43.440]   I'll send you another one.
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:44.440]   I have some.
[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:45.440]   Are we going to move from delicious to that?
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:46.440]   I don't...
[00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:47.440]   You know, delicious is pretty basic.
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:48.440]   It's just delicious.
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:49.440]   It's just...
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:50.440]   It's just nothing there.
[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.080]   You can also blog about your tags.
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.280]   And the idea, the theory behind it is they'll share the advertising revenue.
[00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:00.040]   So if you drove a lot of page views, you'd make some money on it.
[00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.040]   It's slick looking.
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.040]   Very slick looking.
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.040]   It's got some nice tools.
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.640]   I think it might do well.
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:05.640]   I mean, it's interesting.
[00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:09.280]   I mean, it just validates Kevin because it's really more of the same.
[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:10.280]   It's like a...
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:11.280]   It's really like a twisted dig.
[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.560]   Well, they say it's new and innovative because it's giving power to the...
[00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:15.560]   The users.
[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.720]   The users are the ones who can be making the editorial decisions.
[00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:18.720]   Right.
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:19.720]   Never heard of that before.
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:20.720]   Yeah.
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.720]   How do you feel about that Greg as a mainstream journalist?
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.520]   Do you feel like that all these bloggers are just ripping you off?
[00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.000]   You're doing all the work and then they're linking to you?
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   No, no, no.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   I don't.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.120]   I do think there's a little bit of the tail, you know, the dog chasing the tail.
[00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:40.800]   So sooner or later, somebody has to come up with original materials that's costly that
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.760]   a consumer is going to want.
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:49.680]   And as these mainstream media downsize and slim down and proprietize some of their stuff.
[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:54.960]   They're going to find the bloggers that it's a tougher go and they'll be some shaking
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:55.960]   out.
[00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.600]   Yeah, but you know, there's been some blogs that...
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:02.320]   Or quasi blogs or pseudo blogs or whatever you want to call them that have done kind
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.880]   of this already end gadget comes to mind.
[00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:08.120]   They covered CES probably as well as any mainstream media.
[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:09.120]   So they made the turn.
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.200]   They made the transition from just linking.
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:14.160]   And the thing is they have a clue about the online part.
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.080]   I mean, they're essentially taking the photographs and posting them instantly.
[00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:18.080]   So there's just...
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.560]   There wasn't anybody, you know, the old editorial model that you're talking, you know, that
[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:22.560]   we're used to, which is...
[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:23.560]   No filter.
[00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.560]   You have a series and right.
[00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.760]   The non-filtered and you know, there's a lot of...
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:32.800]   The guys who are going to get burned by this change if it actually happens and I think
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.560]   it will, are going to be those...
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:39.160]   That layers and layers of management and editorial management that's in between the writer and
[00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:40.160]   the reader.
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.480]   I mean, that's what we do.
[00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:42.480]   We're a meta show.
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:44.480]   We take other people's stories and we talk about them.
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:48.000]   So I think we could also start doing some of that coverage ourselves too.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   I mean, that's not so...
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.680]   You know, the way I see it, why do it until you have to?
[00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:55.320]   This is how John covered CES.
[00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:57.840]   From the living room.
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:58.840]   From the living room.
[00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:04.800]   Well, but there's a great need for analysis and I'd say that there's two narrow, abandoned
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:05.800]   opinions.
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.120]   So all the blogging generally is welcomed.
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:09.120]   Yeah.
[00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:12.560]   But I just think it's a question of the economics of it.
[00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:13.560]   Now what about...
[00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:15.600]   Somebody's got to pay for the actual news gathering.
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:19.120]   Sooner or later, somebody's going to have to start actually paying for it.
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:20.120]   And gadgets loaded.
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:21.320]   I mean, gadgets doing great.
[00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:24.280]   AOL's foot in the bill and I'm sure they're making money.
[00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:25.280]   Yeah.
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:26.280]   Yeah.
[00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:30.400]   But do you worry about integrity of the stories where people might, you know, consciously
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:34.200]   or unconsciously put a story into a particular slant?
[00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:35.920]   Is there integrity in mainstream media?
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:37.680]   No, I'm not saying but I mean...
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:42.680]   Everybody Greg's working on a paper for the Dvorak Uncensored blog, Dvorak.org/blog.
[00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:45.680]   Wow, that's only frightening to the show.
[00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:46.680]   On this exact topic.
[00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:50.760]   I know I had to get it in there but on this exact topic.
[00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:51.760]   And you want to just summarize.
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:56.320]   Well, you know, I've been teaching journalism for seven years with John Markoff on technology
[00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:59.760]   at Stanford and at UC Berkeley.
[00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:03.840]   One thing about civic journalism that's great is it's giving all this opportunity, as John
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:08.640]   says, and you're saying for people with initiative to shed new vantage points.
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:13.720]   The bad part is what we're finding is that people really do have serious access to grind
[00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:16.320]   and now in a very partisan way.
[00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:21.400]   I mean, even something like this Google not cooperating with the government, you're going
[00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:28.600]   to see a lot of cleavages right away and it's going to be difficult to avoid many issues
[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:30.840]   being shouting matches.
[00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:36.880]   And so I think people over time will come back to some neutral forms of journalism.
[00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:38.880]   But they're going to be much smaller.
[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:40.080]   We are in a polarized nation.
[00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:43.240]   I mean, that we love those kind of polarization.
[00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:44.840]   Who doesn't love cleavage, frankly?
[00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:47.200]   That's one of the things we always need to more of on screen.
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:50.800]   I mean in a deconstructionist, French way of...
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:51.800]   Oh, Kavaz!
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:52.800]   Yeah, I'm sorry.
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:54.360]   In an intellectual term.
[00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:55.360]   Yeah.
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:56.360]   So tell us the story.
[00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:57.360]   So that's what...
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:58.360]   Well, here's the first story that I was...
[00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:02.040]   I've been sitting on for a while, but this is the story that ran in InfoWorld and a few
[00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:08.080]   other places which is titled "IBM Expert, Warns of Short Lifespan for Burn CDs."
[00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:09.080]   Did you all get this?
[00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:10.880]   I got this from 30 different people in the email.
[00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:12.960]   It's like, "What about this?"
[00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:14.480]   He says two, two and a half years.
[00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:16.120]   Two years to five years max.
[00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:17.120]   Boom!
[00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:18.120]   For Burn CDs?
[00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:19.120]   Yeah.
[00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:24.800]   Is that coming from a specific period like CDRs created back in '99 or '99?
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:25.800]   I had no idea.
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:27.800]   I had no idea what it's talking about.
[00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:30.440]   I just installed an application I had on the CD that I've had for six years.
[00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:31.440]   I think it's a bit work-wise.
[00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:32.440]   I have.
[00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:34.280]   I'm not even using CDRs for archiving purposes.
[00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:38.040]   I think it's a terrible idea to archive stuff on burn CDs.
[00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:39.040]   What do you do to archive it on?
[00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:40.040]   I think it's a part of the...
[00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:43.800]   Well, I think it's pretty much been proven that a CD that's pressed last longer than
[00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:44.800]   CD is burned.
[00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:45.800]   Oh, yeah.
[00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:46.800]   Well, that's a fact.
[00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:47.800]   It is a fact.
[00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:48.800]   But so what?
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:52.400]   If I have a bunch of stuff like family heirloom type stuff that I want to keep, I'm not going
[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:53.400]   to burn it on a CD.
[00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:54.400]   And I'm already...
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:55.400]   Here's what's really...
[00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:56.400]   I've had a kind of...
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:57.400]   Wait a minute.
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:01.080]   I recently bought a damn flicker belt because I figured, you know what?
[00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:03.240]   I can upload all of my stuff there.
[00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:04.960]   And flicker will be around in six years.
[00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:05.960]   But you know what?
[00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:08.560]   I trust that right now more than I would stick in a CD in a CD.
[00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:09.560]   Oh.
[00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:10.560]   No, I do.
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:11.560]   I'm a little brother.
[00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:12.560]   Listen, this guy...
[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:14.400]   I backed up by putting stuff on my hand.
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:18.400]   Listen, Gereki, the guy from IBM, he recommends that the...
[00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:19.400]   People use magnetic tapes.
[00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:20.400]   I mean, come on.
[00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:21.400]   I'm a technical guy.
[00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:23.400]   Oh, I got a magnetic tape in the back.
[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:24.400]   Sure.
[00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:25.400]   Let me...
[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:26.400]   Let's just do a little background on this.
[00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:29.000]   The first Burnable CDs came out in 1988.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.880]   I coincidentally managed to get a burner.
[00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:33.880]   He also came out in 1988.
[00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:34.880]   I can't...
[00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:35.880]   I was very...
[00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:37.880]   I got a burner and I...
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:39.440]   I mean, there's a joke there.
[00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:40.440]   I could have come back and I...
[00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:41.440]   I'm taking...
[00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:42.440]   What am I supposed to say to that?
[00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:43.440]   I'm drinking alcohol on the water.
[00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:44.440]   Because you're the better man.
[00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:45.440]   It's just not fair.
[00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:47.440]   You're drinking Pepsi, I'm drinking alcohol and water.
[00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:48.440]   You're not Pepsi.
[00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:49.440]   All right.
[00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:51.080]   So anyway, so in 1988 these things came out.
[00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:54.840]   And I actually had a couple of the early burners of Olympus made one.
[00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:56.040]   They were all one acts.
[00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:57.040]   They were scuzzy.
[00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:58.400]   They're very inconvenient, hard to use.
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:10:59.400]   And you had to find software.
[00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:00.400]   It's amazing.
[00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:02.400]   I still have those discs.
[00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:03.400]   Yeah, they work.
[00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:04.400]   1988.
[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:05.400]   I mean, work, right?
[00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:06.400]   Yes.
[00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:07.400]   Me too.
[00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:08.400]   I have a little...
[00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:09.400]   Go home and check, John.
[00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:10.400]   I...
[00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:11.400]   In fact, you know, I can...
[00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:12.400]   I...
[00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:13.400]   Well, see, this is...
[00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:14.400]   Go home and check.
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:15.400]   Here's the deal.
[00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:16.400]   I just finished a column a couple of days ago because I got this new Plex store drive,
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:18.680]   a DVD reader writer.
[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:22.360]   And because I have a couple of really old discs, I like to check them and see if they
[00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:26.000]   work on the new drive because some of these new drives won't indeed will not read some
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.880]   of these discs because, you know, the waggle track is screwed up.
[00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:29.880]   There's a million reasons.
[00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:30.880]   The waggle track is a...
[00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:31.880]   It's a little...
[00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:32.880]   It is.
[00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:36.680]   It's a little track on the outside that the little head waggles around and then it says,
[00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:37.680]   "Oh, okay, I should be reading."
[00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:40.640]   It's kind of like one of those chihuahuas in the back of a card.
[00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:42.240]   So anyway, so I ran it.
[00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:46.240]   I think we're talking about discs from my OS II era and all these old, old discs.
[00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:49.320]   These things are over 10 years old, which is twice as old as this guy claims they're
[00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:50.320]   going to last.
[00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:51.320]   They all read fine.
[00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:52.320]   And in those days...
[00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:53.320]   No problem.
[00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:54.320]   They didn't know how to make good media.
[00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:55.960]   I mean, there were lots of issues with the early...
[00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:56.960]   You write.
[00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:57.960]   ...CDR media.
[00:11:57.960 --> 00:11:58.960]   It was sealed properly.
[00:11:58.960 --> 00:11:59.960]   It was oxidizing.
[00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:00.960]   Cyanide poisoning.
[00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:01.960]   So you're saying this guy is full of it?
[00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:02.960]   Yeah, totally.
[00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:03.960]   He's full of it too.
[00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:07.600]   Are most of these CDs using the same kind of filament that you held with the laser tape?
[00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:08.600]   No, no, no, no.
[00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:10.560]   There's two or three kinds.
[00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:11.560]   Now the early ones were made...
[00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:12.560]   Say...
[00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:13.720]   Fethalo cyanine for me.
[00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:14.720]   Fethalo.
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:15.720]   Fethalo.
[00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:17.720]   Because TDK has these like, scratch-proof...
[00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:18.720]   CDS.
[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:21.200]   Have you seen those TDK scratch-proof runs where you can...
[00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:23.800]   I mean, you can scratch the crap out of them and they still go.
[00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:24.800]   That's just redundant.
[00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:25.800]   See, they've got a lot of redundant.
[00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:26.800]   That's a lot of...
[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:27.800]   What you don't want to do is...
[00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:28.800]   ...have to scratch them radially.
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:32.640]   If you scratch them along the groove, that means...
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:34.720]   The other one is you can't scratch on the label side.
[00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:35.720]   That's where the data really is.
[00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:36.720]   That's where the reflect...
[00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:37.720]   That's where the reflect...
[00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:39.600]   That's where the reflect of later without no light.
[00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:40.600]   We did a whole thing.
[00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:41.600]   Let him talk.
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:42.600]   This guy knows everything.
[00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:43.600]   Oh, I don't want to.
[00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:47.600]   So, do you have a new guy in?
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:50.320]   So, if you guys...
[00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:52.120]   Did anybody study this or anything?
[00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:54.920]   Because I always was skeptical about cheap media.
[00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:57.000]   We're talking even cheap discs to see the whole one.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.480]   These guys are full of crap when they say two.
[00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:01.400]   This is where we could actually become journalists and do the actual lab research.
[00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:05.400]   Nah, pretty much all of the stuff I've burnt on were all those cheap ones you get at the
[00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:07.760]   computer show, like I'm on a spool and they store it.
[00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:08.760]   They're fun.
[00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:09.760]   I'm actually...
[00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:13.240]   I only had one disc and that was a silver blue die, silver bag blue die.
[00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:16.040]   And that just kind of leaked, like the die leaked out of it.
[00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:18.480]   And that was the only time I actually had a disc go bad.
[00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:22.800]   In the early days, there was a problem with bad sealing of the polycarbonate layers and
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:26.400]   you'd get moisture in there that the reflective layer would oxidize.
[00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:28.960]   People in Florida were saying, "Oh my God, there's a lot of...
[00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:29.960]   You know, rot.
[00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:30.960]   Well, this used to be...
[00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:31.960]   You're talking about the stamped ones.
[00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:36.680]   I mean, the early stamped laser discs, which is where the laser rot came from, were nothing
[00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:38.400]   but they all fluffed.
[00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:39.400]   I saw these were like...
[00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:40.400]   They work?
[00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:41.400]   There's a lot of them that don't...
[00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:42.400]   Really?
[00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:43.400]   They were actually too...
[00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:44.400]   Yeah, basically.
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:45.400]   I think there were two...
[00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:46.400]   See, that's why I got one.
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:47.400]   I think there was a lot of oxidation.
[00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:49.400]   And he was also the oxidation.
[00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:50.400]   He probably oxidizes more.
[00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:55.400]   Wasn't it Disney that wanted to do DVD rentals where once you opened the seal, it oxidizes
[00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:56.400]   a little bit.
[00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:57.400]   I'm lucky I just worked there anymore.
[00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:59.400]   You know, you can't worry about...
[00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:01.400]   No, that was their big solution.
[00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:02.400]   It was a good one.
[00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:07.400]   So, but nevertheless, it scared a lot of people, the story, and it was circulated widely.
[00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:09.440]   He's in the mag tape business, come on.
[00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:10.520]   That's what gets me.
[00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:11.520]   He wants people to use mag tape.
[00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:13.680]   Why don't we just go back to MODiscs?
[00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:16.720]   Why don't we just go back to Chad and use the paper tapes?
[00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:17.720]   Just have the thing grinding away.
[00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:18.720]   With tape.
[00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:19.720]   You know, you can't...
[00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:23.240]   You never lose the data on a paper tape until the paper falls apart.
[00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:26.840]   You know, I think probably the real issue is how long you're going to have a CD player
[00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:28.600]   to play back this data.
[00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:30.080]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:34.680]   The devices are going to not live as long as the storage medium themselves.
[00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:37.960]   Well, you have to keep taking your stuff in a pile.
[00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:41.440]   And then when you get to the next technology, you have to check and recopy it into the
[00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:42.440]   new technology.
[00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:43.840]   You have to keep doing that till you die.
[00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:44.840]   I think people do that.
[00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:47.600]   Like, I've done that with a bunch of stuff just to clear out space.
[00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:51.880]   Like copy them over to DVDRs because, you know, it's five CDs that don't have to stack
[00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:52.880]   on top of each other.
[00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:54.720]   Your kids are going to go up in the attic.
[00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:55.720]   They're going to open this box.
[00:14:55.720 --> 00:15:00.320]   They're going to say, "Wow, Grandpa Roger had 30,000 silver discs.
[00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:01.320]   What are you doing?"
[00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:05.480]   I'm going to do what my dad did when my dad had a bunch of old 8-track tapes.
[00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:08.280]   He actually put it along with the 8-track player.
[00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:14.680]   So I'm just going to shrink wrap a PC with, you know, CD-drive, modern keyboard and mouse
[00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:15.920]   and put it together as a package.
[00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:16.920]   It'll be a CRT.
[00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:20.760]   It's just like the little wax cylinders, you know, from Edison.
[00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:21.760]   Edison.
[00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:23.760]   Edison, you know, they include the little play with it.
[00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:24.760]   You can still get those.
[00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:25.760]   Yeah.
[00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:26.760]   And the view, you know, the view Maddox, you also include the view.
[00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:27.760]   Viewmaster.
[00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:28.760]   Yeah.
[00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:29.760]   Viewmasters.
[00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:30.760]   Yeah.
[00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:31.760]   Let's do the same thing.
[00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:32.760]   Do you have your old viewmasters?
[00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:33.760]   Yes.
[00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:34.760]   What, what, little wheels?
[00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:35.760]   The other one was C-Hawai, like a publication.
[00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:36.760]   I knew he would have those.
[00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:37.760]   Yeah, I would.
[00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:38.760]   Yeah.
[00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:41.960]   He was mighty ass rams somewhere.
[00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:42.960]   Story two.
[00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:43.960]   And that's the big story.
[00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:44.960]   Google.
[00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:48.960]   Google fights when AOL, MS, and then Yahoo!
[00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:49.960]   Cave.
[00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:50.960]   But you know what Google thought?
[00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:51.960]   Let's tell a story.
[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:52.960]   Let's tell a story first.
[00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:57.960]   Department of Justice lawyers wanting the search companies to do their research for them
[00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:00.280]   have gone and went to subpoena to all the search companies.
[00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:01.280]   Here's the issue.
[00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:06.160]   The resurrect, this lousy Child Online Protection Act, which was struck down two years ago by
[00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:10.400]   the appeals court, the appeals court said, "Look, this is a terrible law.
[00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:11.720]   You know, it's unconstitutional.
[00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:16.160]   The only way you can get this back on the books is if you guys prove there's no other
[00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:18.360]   way to fight child porn."
[00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:23.120]   So for two years, the Department of Justice has been laboring trying to prove there's
[00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:25.160]   no other way to fight child porn.
[00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:28.720]   They subpoena records from, from all the search engine companies.
[00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:30.480]   What's a, you know, the first story came out.
[00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:31.480]   Google says, "No."
[00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:34.120]   And then all of a sudden we find out, without a word, Yahoo!
[00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:37.160]   AOL, MSN all said, "Yeah, sure, whatever."
[00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:38.800]   Is this an issue?
[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:39.800]   Absolutely.
[00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:43.640]   I mean, you know, that's, we got a president that's doing domestic spying.
[00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:46.000]   The NSA is spying on everything.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:51.240]   Emails, telephone calls, and I think Google has a brand to protect.
[00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:56.840]   Their value is in somewhat having transcended the fray, being a public trust.
[00:16:56.840 --> 00:17:01.720]   And they know that if they start getting stoking these conspiracy theories about what
[00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:03.240]   they're doing, who they're turning on.
[00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:06.200]   They already have a problem because people, you know, there are people out there that
[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:10.760]   anti-Google forces that have a, they have a grudge against Google for some reason.
[00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:11.760]   I think it's-
[00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:13.360]   But is there really any threat?
[00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:14.840]   Isn't this just aggregate data?
[00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:15.840]   There's no personal information.
[00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:16.840]   Oh, there is.
[00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:21.680]   It's the precedent because basically, while it's hard to believe that the NSA doesn't
[00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:28.920]   already either physically tap their servers or surveilling in other ways, this is just
[00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:29.920]   a slippery slope.
[00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:34.560]   I mean, why doesn't then the police just sit back there with them full-time then?
[00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:35.560]   Right.
[00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:37.800]   Why can't they just be there 24 hours a day?
[00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:41.800]   And if somebody makes a search, how to build an atomic bomb?
[00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:43.640]   This might be a good time to bring Dane Jasper in.
[00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:44.640]   And then they go and get them.
[00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:45.640]   And they just bring them in?
[00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:50.640]   Dane Jasper is, it has been running an independent ISP in Northern California for some time.
[00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:52.440]   The chair over at David makes a room for Dane.
[00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:58.280]   And the reason is because you remember the FBI some years ago had a project called carnivore.
[00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:00.400]   They renamed it as something more benign.
[00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:04.640]   But the idea was they put a box in every internet service provider in the nation and
[00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:06.120]   it's watching all the traffic.
[00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:07.880]   Yeah, it's basically a back-end.
[00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:09.120]   Dane, what happened to carnivore?
[00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:10.120]   Is it around?
[00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:12.480]   Well, I saw an early version.
[00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:14.920]   I saw omnivore, which was a free carnivore.
[00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:15.920]   It ate everything.
[00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:16.920]   It did.
[00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:17.920]   Yeah.
[00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:25.200]   And we had an experience in our business where we had some customers doing bad things.
[00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:29.840]   And the FBI came and said we'd like to deploy one of these devices.
[00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:32.480]   And the funny bit was it didn't work.
[00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:34.720]   So you did deploy it?
[00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:37.920]   Well what we did, this is back in the days of Dial Up.
[00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:44.400]   And we configured the radio servers to give each of these customers a random looking IP
[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:45.680]   in a subnet.
[00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:48.560]   And then we routed those two subnets over a dedicated wire.
[00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:50.240]   And then we handed them that wire.
[00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:51.240]   So we sent these.
[00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:52.600]   So you segregated it.
[00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:53.600]   We segregated these.
[00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:54.600]   But did they have a court order?
[00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:55.600]   They did.
[00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:56.600]   Yeah.
[00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:57.600]   See, they had a court order.
[00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:58.600]   Now that's very different.
[00:18:58.600 --> 00:18:59.600]   Well, this is a subpoena.
[00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:00.600]   Yeah.
[00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:02.800]   Yes, they're not a court order, but there's a subpoena involved.
[00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:04.240]   Yeah, those are two different things.
[00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:05.600]   Those are two very different things.
[00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:10.120]   The court order is a specific investigation for a specific case.
[00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:11.120]   It's like a wiretap.
[00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:13.640]   This is, yeah, on a specific subject.
[00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:14.640]   This is blanket.
[00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:16.640]   Yeah, fishing expedition, right.
[00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:18.240]   And there's a huge difference there.
[00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:19.240]   Yeah.
[00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:21.680]   Actually, I was very impressed in working with the FBI.
[00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:23.920]   This was in 1998.
[00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:28.720]   They had a computer crime squad, and they really knew what they were doing.
[00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:32.000]   And they began these dialogues with, you know, we have a question about this.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   They were very specific.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.640]   We'd like a very narrow answer.
[00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:38.680]   Yeah, but the thing here is that we were differentiating between, there was a crime,
[00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:41.640]   I would assume, involved with this kind of thing.
[00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:43.360]   There's no crime involved with this Google--
[00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:44.360]   It's a fishing expedition.
[00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:45.760]   They're saying, let's see how bad it is.
[00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:48.280]   Are trying to get a law repast.
[00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:52.200]   You know, to me, I'm saying, why don't you just rewrite the law?
[00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:53.600]   You got the, here's the Republicans.
[00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:54.600]   They got the president.
[00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:55.600]   They got the Congressman.
[00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:56.600]   They got the Senators.
[00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:57.600]   They got everything.
[00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:58.600]   They ought to be able to pass the law.
[00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:04.400]   Why don't they rewrite the law so it's constitutional and walk it through Congress and pass it?
[00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:05.400]   This is the second time.
[00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:06.400]   Why?
[00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:07.400]   Because they don't know how to write laws?
[00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:08.400]   They don't know how to write laws.
[00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:09.400]   They're a chipper, copper.
[00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:10.400]   They keep trying.
[00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:13.320]   They can't get a law because of the first amendment.
[00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:15.360]   Well, then they're doing something wrong.
[00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:18.560]   What they're trying to do should be they should be able to write a law instead of trying to
[00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:22.560]   shoehorn this stuff with this bogus, this invasion of--
[00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:25.040]   I mean, this is like a worse than a fishing expedition.
[00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:26.920]   This is a surveillance effort.
[00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:28.560]   Here's the stinger.
[00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:30.600]   Wall Street hits Google hard.
[00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:34.640]   Their stock drops 8% as a result of fighting this.
[00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:38.600]   Yeah, well, it's fear that the government's going to find some way to take it out on Google.
[00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:42.320]   This is a Republican pro-business government supposedly.
[00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:46.560]   This company gets slammed because they're not going along with the program, which is not
[00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:48.840]   a criminal investigation whatsoever.
[00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:51.840]   It's just some thing that the Bush administration wants to do.
[00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:54.040]   Then they get hit by Wall Street.
[00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:56.440]   What kind of pro-business environment is this?
[00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:57.440]   What did MSN--
[00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:00.600]   Don't get me started on Sorrow Banes Oxley.
[00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:02.880]   We don't want to see your socks.
[00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:09.920]   When it comes down to MSN Yahoo and AOL, what did they say to justify giving up the information?
[00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:10.920]   Why did they just say--
[00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:11.920]   Yeah, sure.
[00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:12.920]   And Google say no.
[00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:13.920]   I mean--
[00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:15.880]   There were some lame quotes here and there.
[00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:18.080]   Are they rethinking saying, geez, maybe we--
[00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:19.080]   Well, they blew it.
[00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:20.680]   They did it right now.
[00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:21.680]   Our stock could apply.
[00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:25.120]   Obviously, if you're a member of these organizations, you're right.
[00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:26.440]   Here's the real question.
[00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:28.280]   Is this a great opportunity to buy Google?
[00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:29.280]   That's going to say.
[00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:33.200]   Under 500 bucks, they hit by the way your target price a long time ago.
[00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:34.200]   You predicted five.
[00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:37.000]   I'm almost going to 12.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   12?
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.640]   I'm not going to do it.
[00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:41.080]   I'm just saying I'm almost going to do it.
[00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:45.720]   By the way, I think the SEC would require us to say something about, don't listen to
[00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:46.720]   us.
[00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:47.720]   OK, so--
[00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:49.720]   No, actually, I would like to stop.
[00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:51.720]   I actually want to watch and I can--
[00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:53.760]   Isn't there some sort of disclaimer you have to--
[00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:55.560]   I don't know any stock in Google at the moment.
[00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:57.120]   Actually, I do, I should say.
[00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:58.640]   Well, you do have to say.
[00:21:58.640 --> 00:21:59.640]   I have stock in Google.
[00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:00.640]   I have 70 shares.
[00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:01.640]   It's not like I'm going to--
[00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:02.640]   It's not like I'm going to--
[00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:03.640]   It shares.
[00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:04.640]   It could be a million shares.
[00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:05.640]   Well, I bought it.
[00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:06.640]   It moves up slow.
[00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:07.640]   You know when I bought it?
[00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:08.640]   Jump on.
[00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:12.560]   When I was looking at Google and when the epiphany hit me--
[00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:16.920]   and we've talked about this, but it was six months ago, eight months ago--
[00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:18.640]   that this is not a search engine company.
[00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:19.840]   It's an advertising company.
[00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:20.840]   I suddenly got it.
[00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:25.080]   I got their business model and I said, these guys are going to make some money.
[00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:31.240]   But I think you're right, Greg, that's very incumbent on them to be almost above suspicion
[00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:33.560]   to be the kind of the public trust, right?
[00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:35.640]   People are already scared of what Google knows.
[00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:37.640]   Yeah, the telephone company had that state.
[00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:40.040]   AT&T had that state as for many, many years.
[00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:42.800]   And Google seemed to have inherited it and they want to keep it.
[00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:49.280]   So, Dane, there's no carnivore in-- he runs a sonic net, which is a great internet service
[00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:50.280]   product.
[00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:54.240]   I want to ask him this, too, because I've heard that since 9/11, most ISPs have installed
[00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:56.960]   some sort of carnivore-like device.
[00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:57.960]   Have you heard anything about this?
[00:22:57.960 --> 00:22:58.960]   I haven't.
[00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:00.400]   Has it come up at Sispa meetings?
[00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:01.400]   No.
[00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:08.680]   If that was the intent, that would be in the national and international backbones.
[00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:10.160]   They could do it so much easier.
[00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:11.880]   They really wouldn't push that to the edge.
[00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:13.600]   That's actually where we would see it.
[00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:14.600]   And yeah, I mean--
[00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:15.600]   Oh, yeah, I know.
[00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:16.600]   They always sound like a--
[00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:18.240]   Jerry's a-- there is a national line.
[00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:20.480]   The British-- they have conceded that.
[00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:21.480]   The British--
[00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:22.480]   Yeah, yeah, I've heard that, too.
[00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:23.480]   But you said they have meetings.
[00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:25.480]   This is like the trilateral commission.
[00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:27.760]   It's a beer drinking club.
[00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:32.760]   You know, do you find it hard to believe that the-- well, the NSA is not supposed to, but
[00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:36.600]   some government agency that has mandated to watch domestic--
[00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:38.600]   Can you imagine how boring it would be to even listen to this?
[00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:39.600]   They don't know this computerized.
[00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:40.600]   It's all keywords.
[00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:41.600]   Yeah.
[00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:42.600]   They just say, OK.
[00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:43.600]   He said hummus.
[00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:44.600]   He said hummus.
[00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:45.600]   He said--
[00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:46.600]   He said the camera is going to go away.
[00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:47.600]   He said the camera is going to go away.
[00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:48.600]   He said the camera is going to go away.
[00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:50.200]   He said, "You're supposed to use code words.
[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:53.720]   You're supposed to say, for example, if you're in the business of doing any security work
[00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:56.560]   at all, you say, "No such agency.
[00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:58.000]   And Christians in action."
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   Those are your two--
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   Christians in action.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   Those are your two.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   That's the standard code words that you use and they will not pick up on them.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   It's like--
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   Oh, I think they will now.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   They just--
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   No, I don't think so.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   They don't listen to it.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   They don't listen to it.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.440]   Actually, you'd be surprised.
[00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:14.960]   I got an email today from a major in the Air Force who's in the Pentagon.
[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:17.400]   He said-- actually, I should get his permission.
[00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:20.080]   I won't say his name, but he said he's been telling all his buddies at the Pentagon.
[00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:22.360]   He says, "We get lots of good insight information."
[00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:23.360]   That's the Twitter.
[00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:24.360]   That is so sad.
[00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:27.360]   That really is.
[00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:28.360]   No, I think it's great.
[00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:29.360]   It's a desk jock.
[00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:31.360]   No, I mean, they think they're getting any good information from us.
[00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:32.360]   They get a problem.
[00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:35.000]   Patrick and I, at one point, were invited by the Secret Service to come to their convention
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   in Florida.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   That'd be cool.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.440]   This was a few years ago and talked to them about forensics and I thought, "Wait a minute.
[00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:42.000]   We're two TV hosts.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.320]   We don't know anything.
[00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:45.080]   We pretend to for television."
[00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:46.480]   No, I gave that talk, actually.
[00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:47.480]   Have you done that?
[00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:48.480]   Have you been down there?
[00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:49.480]   It's actually very cool.
[00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:50.480]   It wasn't there.
[00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:56.160]   That's for the FBI and we're educating local agencies, the police department, the sheriff's
[00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:57.160]   department.
[00:24:57.160 --> 00:25:02.120]   The big question was, "How long do you, as internet service writers, keep logs of who's
[00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:04.920]   been logging in, what their IP address was?
[00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:07.400]   How long do we make you keep that information?"
[00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:08.960]   Well, you don't.
[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:09.960]   There's no law.
[00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:14.040]   That's why the guy at the company guy.
[00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:17.200]   Can you edit that word there?
[00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:18.200]   Company.
[00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:20.080]   If you go to...
[00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:22.080]   He would erase his logs daily.
[00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:24.600]   Well, that would too, if my company were called it.
[00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:26.040]   You know what I'm talking about?
[00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:27.040]   Yeah.
[00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:28.040]   Pud.
[00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:29.440]   Yeah, Pud.
[00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:31.640]   If you go to a freaked company, he also has a...
[00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:33.680]   He doesn't say that one.
[00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:34.680]   It's the same thing.
[00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:35.680]   I haven't been a family friend for years.
[00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:37.160]   He has a family friend for any version.
[00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:38.720]   I can't remember what it is.
[00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:40.320]   That's why it was just basically a...
[00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:41.320]   Frickin' company?
[00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:43.560]   It's a virtual water pool for people.
[00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:45.400]   I think it's lost its edge.
[00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:46.560]   Pud was brilliant, though.
[00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:48.000]   Pud's brilliance was.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.280]   And even in a minute of this, I just write something that maintains itself and kind of
[00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:56.800]   generates coin and I can go do something else and I keep doing these and they...
[00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:57.800]   You know, the money comes in.
[00:25:57.800 --> 00:25:58.800]   It sounds like one of those...
[00:25:58.800 --> 00:25:59.800]   Yeah, it was a quick scheme.
[00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:00.800]   It was a work of art.
[00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:01.800]   It makes money by itself.
[00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:02.800]   You don't have to do anything.
[00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:04.880]   You just put an ad in the newspaper.
[00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:05.880]   It worked.
[00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:06.880]   It worked, right?
[00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:07.880]   It's doable on the internet.
[00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:08.880]   It worked very well.
[00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:09.880]   It's a community.
[00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:10.880]   Yeah.
[00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:11.880]   But then...
[00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:12.880]   What else?
[00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:14.160]   So anyway, so they were shocked that you don't have to keep logs.
[00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:16.000]   How long do you keep your logs?
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:22.640]   It varies depending upon the service, but I would guess...
[00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:26.160]   I have a lot of exposure to internet service writers as I'm serving as the president of
[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:28.080]   this California Association.
[00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:29.560]   Most folks keep logs a month.
[00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:31.240]   How come that long, even?
[00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:32.640]   And why not forever?
[00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:37.400]   Well, you want to know if somebody is sending spam from your network, if somebody is hacking
[00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:39.280]   from your network, but you'd be surprised.
[00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:40.280]   You want to...
[00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:42.480]   If the RIAA sends you a letter, you want to be able to...
[00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:43.480]   Well, let's just keep them forever.
[00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:44.480]   What do you mean?
[00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:45.480]   Storage.
[00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:46.480]   Storage.
[00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:48.160]   How much storage is it going to take up?
[00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:49.160]   You'd be surprised.
[00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:51.720]   We're talking about authentication logs.
[00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:52.720]   Apparently I would.
[00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:56.560]   Every time somebody logs in to check their email, which they might have configured their
[00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:59.880]   client to do once every minute or once every five minutes, we've got an authentication
[00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:00.880]   packet.
[00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:03.720]   And every time somebody logs in, logs out, we've allocated a lucky...
[00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:04.720]   So I'll ask you.
[00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:05.720]   There's a lot of logs.
[00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:07.520]   I've been a customer for Danes for a long time.
[00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:08.520]   It's for what?
[00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:09.520]   Oh, is that what you're doing?
[00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:10.520]   I miss...
[00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:11.520]   I miss Kentucky.
[00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:12.520]   No, no.
[00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:13.520]   He's not responsible for that part.
[00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:14.520]   I miss Gary.
[00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:15.520]   In fact, I wish he were...
[00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:19.200]   Well, you know, we had a $30,000 bill with Sonic that with Danes.
[00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:20.200]   He just saved our butt.
[00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:21.200]   How did that happen?
[00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:22.200]   Oh, you don't want to know.
[00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:25.880]   This was that thing when I moved the RSS feed off feed burner without thinking.
[00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:26.880]   I just put...
[00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:27.880]   I stuck it on my...
[00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:29.360]   Oh, and you were actually doing these huge feeds?
[00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:30.360]   No.
[00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:32.680]   The problem is with an RSS feed, I thought they're small.
[00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:33.680]   They're 30K big deal.
[00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:35.200]   How much could that be?
[00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:38.360]   The problem is, first of all, it wasn't a server account.
[00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:39.600]   It was just an ISP server.
[00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:41.960]   You know, the 10 megabytes they gave you for free.
[00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:46.240]   But the second problem was that all of these podcast clients, they don't just hit it once.
[00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:47.880]   They hit it every five minutes.
[00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:51.880]   So it's 30K every five minutes from a quarter of a million people.
[00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:52.880]   Right, right, right.
[00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:54.120]   Yeah, that RSS stuff is really...
[00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:57.080]   You think there are a lot of people out there saying, "Is there a new podcast?
[00:27:57.080 --> 00:27:58.080]   Is there a new podcast?"
[00:27:58.080 --> 00:27:59.080]   There's a new one.
[00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:01.680]   They're on the edge of their seats in an automated fashion.
[00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:02.680]   Yeah.
[00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:03.680]   Well, some people go by hand.
[00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:06.160]   They don't even know and then it shows up every five minutes.
[00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:07.160]   Oh, so you were just...
[00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:08.160]   So is that...
[00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:09.160]   Have you noticed...
[00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:10.160]   Is this a real problem?
[00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:11.480]   Is this the Achilles heel of RSS?
[00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:13.480]   Fortunately, Dane knows me and we're friends.
[00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:15.480]   I saw the revenue reports come through.
[00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:18.280]   We made some money this month.
[00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:20.280]   So I see Leo's account.
[00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:21.280]   $28,000?
[00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:23.280]   Yeah, actually, his macro.
[00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:26.720]   You'd be surprised when we cleared the personal account.
[00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:29.280]   Well, we can clear to Leo's credit card.
[00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:30.280]   You cleared?
[00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:31.280]   Yeah, cleared.
[00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:33.080]   Oh, rather, you're buying.
[00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:36.040]   I think we cleared 14 grand or something to Leo's credit card.
[00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:40.840]   And so I see the revenue reports, you know, the week I say, "Leo, report 14 grand."
[00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:44.840]   I look at the pending, he's got another 50 grand back then.
[00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:45.840]   Another 50 or something.
[00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:47.560]   So I pick up the hammer, Leo.
[00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:48.560]   This is two months.
[00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:49.880]   This only took two months.
[00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:51.560]   It was like 15 a month.
[00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:55.160]   Oh, so we just returned it and called Leo and said, "Leo, what's up?"
[00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:56.680]   So kids, just a word of warning.
[00:28:56.680 --> 00:28:57.680]   Holy mackerel.
[00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:01.480]   If you've got a little setting and you do and I should have paid attention, that turns
[00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:03.880]   off the amount of downloads after a few hit the volume.
[00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:05.560]   Yeah, we actually emailed you a warning.
[00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:06.560]   Yeah, I didn't read my email.
[00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:07.560]   He doesn't read his email.
[00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:09.600]   Folks, ladies and gentlemen, take a note.
[00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:10.600]   You don't read my email either.
[00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:11.600]   I read my email warning.
[00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:13.160]   That's because you have these locked eggs.
[00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:14.600]   You lock it with this digital...
[00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:16.080]   No, it's a digital signature.
[00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:17.080]   It's not locked.
[00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:19.360]   There'll be a column coming up on this, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:21.080]   John can't read digital signatures.
[00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:23.080]   Digital signature thing is a joke.
[00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:24.080]   Wait a minute.
[00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:25.080]   Wait, wait a minute.
[00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:26.080]   Are you the rest of you guys have a problem with it?
[00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:27.080]   No.
[00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:28.080]   No.
[00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:29.080]   No.
[00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:30.080]   I sent you email.
[00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:31.080]   I sent everybody email.
[00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:32.080]   So here's the deal.
[00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:33.080]   Most of the time yours doesn't even have the signature half the time.
[00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:34.080]   Just PGP sign is PGP.
[00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:35.040]   I have it sign it that way.
[00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:38.240]   If you get it from me, you know that it came from me and nobody's modified.
[00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:39.240]   Right.
[00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:40.960]   And then I send them say, "I do a hit respond."
[00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:45.080]   And it comes up with a little note saying, "Oh, this person cannot receive anything that's
[00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:46.320]   not digitally signed."
[00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:47.320]   Really?
[00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:48.320]   Yeah.
[00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:49.320]   And then it says, "Click here for the game."
[00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:50.320]   What do you know?
[00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:51.320]   Programmer using.
[00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:52.320]   Then it says, "Click here."
[00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:53.320]   It's the one that prevents man.
[00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:56.640]   I'm using Outlook Express like nobody in the world uses it.
[00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:57.640]   Oh.
[00:29:57.640 --> 00:29:58.640]   It hasn't been updated since 1990.
[00:29:58.640 --> 00:29:59.640]   I did.
[00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:00.640]   I've been meaning to change it.
[00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:01.920]   I've been trying different things.
[00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:03.320]   I was testing software on it.
[00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:04.320]   So I got stuck on it.
[00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:05.320]   You got to go on it.
[00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:06.320]   Most probably that's the number one.
[00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:07.320]   I bet you that's the number one.
[00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:11.840]   I used to use UDORA and then blew up a couple of boxes.
[00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:15.720]   They never could figure out why and I switched over to Mozilla and then I had to test some
[00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:16.720]   software.
[00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:18.240]   That's what I'm going to next.
[00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:19.240]   I like that.
[00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:23.640]   But the point is, it comes up with this little message and it says, "Get your digital signature
[00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:24.640]   here."
[00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:26.640]   So I click on it and it's a 404 error.
[00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:29.440]   It's because you got old software.
[00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:30.440]   It's crap.
[00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:33.880]   Are you using IMAP or using PAP?
[00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:35.040]   I'm using IMAP.
[00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:37.840]   I'm very curious about people's desire for IMAP.
[00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:38.840]   I use IMAP.
[00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:39.840]   I'm sorry to Segway.
[00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:41.600]   It's a perfect Segway.
[00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:42.600]   Welcome to Twitch.
[00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:43.600]   It's a good one.
[00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:46.960]   As an internet service writer, we hate podcasts.
[00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:47.960]   We hate IMAP.
[00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:49.960]   I'm being completely frank.
[00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:51.960]   You hate my mind about a man with it uses?
[00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:54.560]   Hey, it was my service guy that told me to use IMAP.
[00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:55.800]   IMAP is great.
[00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:56.800]   Everybody should use IMAP.
[00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:57.800]   You can tell my tool.
[00:30:57.800 --> 00:31:01.520]   Can you explain to people out there who don't know what IMAP is compared to PAP?
[00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:03.360]   Normally when you use a PAP server, you can use--
[00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:06.040]   You can use the PAP stands for Post Office Protocol.
[00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:07.120]   You go on the PAP server.
[00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:08.160]   You download the mail.
[00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:10.080]   You clear it off of the ISP server.
[00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:11.080]   Thank you.
[00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:12.080]   And he's down on your server.
[00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:13.400]   And yeah, he says thank you.
[00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:14.560]   There's a problem with that though.
[00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:18.520]   For people who have multiple machines like me, then I have to sync each machine.
[00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:22.240]   If I send a message, it's in my sent box on one machine, but not on others.
[00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:27.280]   IMAP is more like Microsoft Exchange or any central server where the mail stays on the
[00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:29.200]   server and I use my clients.
[00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:31.000]   And by the way, Outlook Express works fine.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   Outlook works.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:33.760]   You can get a move off there if you want to.
[00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:34.760]   You can.
[00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:38.480]   You can copy it, but most of the time you leave it on there and you can access it from anywhere.
[00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:40.280]   It's kind of like web mail.
[00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:42.000]   But you can use a web mail client with it.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:46.280]   I use squirrel mail, for example, to go to my IMAP account and I can get my mail one
[00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:47.440]   on anybody's computer.
[00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:51.280]   Just so you feel better, Dane, I use an IMAP service called Fastmail.
[00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:52.280]   It's out of Australia.
[00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:53.280]   It's excellent.
[00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:54.280]   Yeah, we've been looking at them.
[00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:55.280]   They're wonderful.
[00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:58.960]   And a lot of traditional internet service providers are not offering IMAP.
[00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:02.880]   The vast majority constantly being pounded is the reason.
[00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:06.120]   And the idea is that you've got three different clients at three different locations.
[00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:11.480]   You leave the mail on the server because that's centrally accessible.
[00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:15.160]   And what I'm seeing is users are moving over to web mail because they're getting the same
[00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:18.160]   benefit of ubiquitous access.
[00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:22.440]   And I think it's time for ISPs probably have to stop resisting that and find a way
[00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:25.080]   to do what IMAP in an economic way.
[00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:26.080]   But--
[00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:27.080]   Get a Gmail account, John.
[00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:28.080]   No, this is fine.
[00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:31.960]   I got the greatest no spam guy in the world.
[00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:33.320]   I don't get any spam.
[00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:34.320]   All right.
[00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:35.320]   All right.
[00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:36.760]   But you don't get my mail either.
[00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:38.160]   No, but actually you get it.
[00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:39.160]   You can't send it back.
[00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:40.160]   I get your mail.
[00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:41.160]   It's a client.
[00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:44.520]   And actually outlook occasionally, for some reason, outlook will give-- people will complain,
[00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:45.880]   oh, I got a blank message.
[00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:46.880]   I don't--
[00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:49.360]   Oh, you knew what happened with your stuff a little while ago?
[00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:50.840]   It just stopped.
[00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:51.840]   You'd message never came in.
[00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:53.600]   It always came in as an attachment.
[00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:54.600]   Even though it was like a hello, how you doing?
[00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:55.600]   That's bad.
[00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:57.800]   That's what he was using, a Mac or something.
[00:32:57.800 --> 00:32:58.800]   Yeah.
[00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:01.240]   Is he sending HTML mail?
[00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:03.080]   I have no one to do one.
[00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:04.600]   He's sending HTML mail.
[00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:05.600]   Whatever it is, it's like the digital--
[00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:06.960]   He says, all my mail's in flash.
[00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:07.960]   He's like--
[00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:08.960]   Oh, gosh.
[00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:12.400]   The reason he's got the digital signatures, because I know one day there's a pop-up, and
[00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:13.640]   he said, oh, I think that's a good idea.
[00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:14.640]   And he just clicks on every--
[00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:15.640]   No.
[00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:16.640]   --everybody in the maniac.
[00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:18.880]   I did it because I was being impersonated.
[00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:22.040]   And I wanted to make sure that when people got mail from me, they knew it was from me.
[00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:24.760]   So I tell-- but people get-- I get mail all the time.
[00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:29.200]   People said, hey, I saw you in the chat room, or I saw you comment on my blog, or you sent
[00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:30.200]   me an email.
[00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:31.200]   It's just somebody impersonating me.
[00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:32.280]   Which is going to happen now.
[00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:35.240]   This hasn't-- like, this doesn't stop it?
[00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:38.680]   No, but I tell people, and I'm telling you, if you get mail from me, it's not from me,
[00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:39.840]   unless it's signed.
[00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:41.520]   You won't get mail from them, folks.
[00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:42.720]   Well, that's what it's doing.
[00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:44.960]   So if you got mail from me, it wasn't from me anyway.
[00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:45.960]   Right.
[00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:46.960]   Why don't you just make that statement?
[00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:47.960]   Greg, what do you do?
[00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:48.960]   Do you use IMAP?
[00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:49.960]   Do you use pop-up?
[00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:50.960]   He doesn't know what he's doing.
[00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:51.960]   No, I--
[00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:52.960]   He-- you wait.
[00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:53.960]   Get this.
[00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:54.960]   Hot mail.
[00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:57.400]   He said it back up his file.
[00:33:57.400 --> 00:34:01.320]   I want to just talking back to during that conversation to tell you what I use.
[00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:06.960]   I mean, when you were talking about are the DVDs or CD burns going to last, I'm thinking
[00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:07.960]   global warming.
[00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:10.960]   I mean, we just want to see it.
[00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:14.960]   New Orleans, I mean, we're thinking about are the CDs going to last?
[00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:15.960]   Just keep thinking about it.
[00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:21.320]   So you're trivializing our concerns.
[00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:24.320]   I didn't mean to be disheartening my own.
[00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:25.320]   You weren't even feeling infected.
[00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:27.080]   Yeah, I was trying to put it into perspective.
[00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:28.800]   And I think for most people, the mail--
[00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:31.240]   You're a financial records on a CD.
[00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:32.240]   This is a big deal.
[00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:36.040]   The records of New Orleans could have been on a CD and it could have been destroyed by
[00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:37.040]   the hurricane.
[00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:40.200]   And that would have helped if they were all backed up there.
[00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:44.120]   So you're saying until President Bush signs the Kyoto Accords, there's no point in putting
[00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:45.120]   my stuff on a CD?
[00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:47.240]   No, back to the mail.
[00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:54.880]   I think most people use the mail system of lease resistance, lease work for them.
[00:34:54.880 --> 00:35:03.000]   And it's surprising when you're super power users like you guys are beeping along in relative
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:10.600]   bliss that most people are still caught up in a very, very low level of interaction with
[00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:11.600]   the computer.
[00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:13.960]   I can never use heart mail because it sounded like a sex thing.
[00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:14.960]   It just didn't--
[00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:15.960]   It is.
[00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:17.680]   Well, what do you think about Yahoo then?
[00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:18.680]   Yahoo is a little better.
[00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:19.680]   It's a little better.
[00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:20.680]   People like that, but Gmail, they like that.
[00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:21.680]   The new Yahoo mail.
[00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:23.680]   Look at the new Yahoo mail.
[00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:24.680]   That's what it says.
[00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:25.680]   Awesome.
[00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:26.680]   It's on a spot on post.
[00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:27.680]   Yeah.
[00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:29.160]   And it looks just like Outlook.
[00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:30.160]   It's incredible.
[00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:32.560]   Now, how do you feel about that kind of stuff today?
[00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:35.360]   Because that is also very bandwidth intensive, isn't it?
[00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:36.360]   It is.
[00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:41.000]   And same sort of scenario, but we think it's great.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.200]   And actually, we tried to license on post.
[00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:46.440]   Yeah, they got bought by Yahoo and they stopped at a scenario call.
[00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:47.440]   It beats squirrel mail.
[00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:49.240]   It beats all the other web-based mails.
[00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:51.040]   It's just really easy to use.
[00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:53.400]   Let's get back to this RSS thing.
[00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:54.600]   It's such a big deal.
[00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:55.600]   $30,000.
[00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:56.600]   $30,000.
[00:35:56.600 --> 00:35:58.000]   I mean, I'm really kind of shocked.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:01.240]   By the way, somebody canceled his membership and quit.
[00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:04.720]   He said, I'm not giving you my $2 because I hate Devorak.
[00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:05.720]   So--
[00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:06.720]   Hey, well, you know, he's not listening.
[00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:08.720]   I guess I can't say anything about it.
[00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:09.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:12.480]   I said, take your $2.
[00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:13.480]   No way.
[00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:15.000]   Now, you hate-- you know, they're Devorakators out there.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.080]   They tend to be old Macintosh hats.
[00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:17.680]   I don't care.
[00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:18.680]   You know what?
[00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:19.600]   You're the Howard Co-cell and Twit.
[00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:21.720]   Like I said, you're a lightning rod.
[00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:22.760]   Talented like it is.
[00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:23.520]   That's right.
[00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:24.280]   So we've got--
[00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:27.080]   Yeah, they love you, but they always listen.
[00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:27.080]   So--
[00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:28.600]   So we've got Leo impersonators.
[00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:29.920]   As Leo does a much better--
[00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:30.760]   Dewarakators?
[00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:32.760]   I'm like, crap, this Howard Co-cell.
[00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:34.240]   How do what they look like?
[00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:34.760]   Do they guys--
[00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:36.680]   They feel like a Leo impersonator.
[00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:38.320]   Leo impersonator is probably a woman.
[00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:39.760]   It could be the same guy that hates Jones.
[00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:43.360]   So let's get back to this $30,000 RSS thing.
[00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:44.800]   Have you noticed this happening?
[00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:47.560]   I mean, because the RSS is very important to the blogging
[00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:48.920]   community, for example.
[00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:50.040]   And the podcasters.
[00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:50.520]   Yeah.
[00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:54.760]   And it-- you know, anytime you create a mechanized process
[00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:57.720]   to repeatedly pull something.
[00:36:57.720 --> 00:37:01.440]   And it's a pull mechanism instead of a push mechanism.
[00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:02.760]   And it's mechanized.
[00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:03.320]   You're going to--
[00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:04.880]   No, I'm going to use a lot more bandwidth than you need to.
[00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:08.360]   My understanding is-- and obviously, I'm not coding RSS.
[00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:09.080]   You have done this.
[00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:09.920]   You have coded RSS.
[00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:10.360]   By hand.
[00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:11.200]   By hand.
[00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:12.640]   But my understanding is the mechanism
[00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:15.120]   the way it works is that you set the RSS feed up
[00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:20.800]   as an XML file, which has got data in it, that tells the other side
[00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:24.440]   that comes in and looks at it because they've subscribed.
[00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:24.960]   It parses it.
[00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:25.440]   It's got a response.
[00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:27.240]   They've subscribed, and they say, OK, I'm
[00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:28.800]   supposed to go and hit this thing.
[00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:31.200]   I thought in the RSS feed itself, it would say, well,
[00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:32.360]   we're going to update once a week.
[00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:35.160]   There's a time to live, which is generally ignored.
[00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:35.560]   Oh.
[00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:36.280]   So you--
[00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:37.120]   Well, that doesn't help.
[00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:37.640]   Yeah.
[00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:42.280]   And by the way, this raises an issue with one of our stories.
[00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:45.400]   A lot of these people are not implementing RSS properly.
[00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:46.920]   Dave Weiner was very upset.
[00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:49.400]   Apple-- you know, Apple's got this new photo casting feature
[00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:53.160]   part of the iPhoto, where you can share your photos.
[00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:55.080]   It's called-- no, it's called photo casting.
[00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:56.880]   What you'll do is you'll share a folder.
[00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:59.560]   And if another person is using iPhoto,
[00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:01.840]   and then you have to get the new iPhoto,
[00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:03.000]   you can subscribe to--
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.680]   grandma can subscribe to your photos over the net.
[00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:06.560]   But Steve Jobs in his speech says,
[00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:09.200]   and it's industry standard RSS.
[00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:12.160]   So anybody with an RSS reader can also subscribe.
[00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:13.800]   Well, it turns out it's awful.
[00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:14.840]   It's abysmal.
[00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:16.440]   The RSS community is going crazy.
[00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:19.520]   And this is the problem is people implement RSS readers,
[00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:21.880]   but pay no attention to this spec.
[00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:22.240]   And then--
[00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:23.120]   What is the spec, though?
[00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:24.760]   There's multiple specks.
[00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:28.520]   I think there was a 0.96 and a 0.98 and a 1.1 and a 1.0.
[00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:29.480]   Yeah, there's Adam.
[00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:31.160]   I mean, yeah, there's no-- there are issues with that,
[00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:32.680]   as well, I agree.
[00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:34.760]   But there is at least specs for those--
[00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:37.480]   there's three good standards that people can follow.
[00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:38.480]   And they should follow.
[00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:39.840]   And you work.
[00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:40.560]   They work very well.
[00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:42.400]   I mean, that's how podcasting works, if I--
[00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:43.960]   It doesn't work that well if you're getting bills
[00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:45.360]   for $30,000 for doing nothing.
[00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:46.720]   You know, I was stupid.
[00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:47.720]   Personal account.
[00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:48.440]   I was stupid.
[00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:49.440]   I put it in the wrong place.
[00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:50.680]   I didn't pay attention.
[00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:51.920]   And that was just a dumb thing to do.
[00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:53.400]   But it is an object lesson for people
[00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:55.160]   who want to create content.
[00:38:55.160 --> 00:38:56.960]   bandwidth becomes a big deal.
[00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:59.240]   If we didn't have bandwidth for this from America Online,
[00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:00.800]   we couldn't afford to do this.
[00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:01.280]   And I wonder--
[00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:02.960]   Even though that guy gave us $2.
[00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:05.160]   Because we've got $2 guy, you know?
[00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:05.960]   Yeah, I've got two--
[00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:08.880]   Why do we still need ISPs?
[00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:12.640]   Why aren't there just, say, four or five bandwidth companies?
[00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:13.720]   And that's it.
[00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:15.400]   I hate to say, but we're getting there.
[00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:16.440]   Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.
[00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:17.440]   But is that not a good way?
[00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:18.160]   Not a good way.
[00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:19.160]   It's not a good thing.
[00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:19.880]   That's aggregation.
[00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:21.440]   Why isn't it a good thing?
[00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:22.800]   Because these guys can all of us--
[00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:26.160]   That's like saying, why don't we just have one newspaper?
[00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:28.040]   Here's why it's not a good thing.
[00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:31.280]   And it's already been hinted at by either the Comcast guys
[00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:33.000]   or the AT&T guys, one of the two.
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.320]   The guy forgot Whitaker or whatever his name is.
[00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:37.680]   He says, you know, I think it's a kind of crummy
[00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:41.480]   that these Google guys are making money off of our hard work.
[00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:43.560]   I think we should maybe charge them
[00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:44.920]   or maybe take a piece of their action.
[00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:45.880]   It's like a gangster.
[00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:48.400]   I think we should-- Google's making billions.
[00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:49.360]   I think we should--
[00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:51.200]   Because that's what they did with the programmers.
[00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:54.240]   I mean, that's what Comcast and Malone did with--
[00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:54.760]   Sleeves them.
[00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:56.200]   --with television shows for so long.
[00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:59.040]   They went to them and said, hey, you don't give us 10% of your show.
[00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:00.600]   You're not on our cable network.
[00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:02.160]   And maybe that's what they're thinking.
[00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:02.960]   You're wrong.
[00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:04.160]   And that's the problem with--
[00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:07.320]   But even with Dane, he's saying when people are using Yahoo
[00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:11.360]   Mail, they're using our bandwidth for your rich media.
[00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:13.360]   And it's cost to us because of all the--
[00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:15.640]   And the problem is, of course, is flat fee pricing.
[00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:16.140]   Yeah.
[00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:18.000]   Well, in the internet service paradigm,
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:19.960]   consumers are buying bandwidth.
[00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:25.600]   And in the telcos concept, they own a network.
[00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:27.080]   And people are paying for access into it.
[00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:27.520]   But they're not.
[00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:30.240]   And they're used to being paid in both directions.
[00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:31.240]   I think the kind of--
[00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:32.560]   If they terminate at all.
[00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:36.960]   That's treating broadband as a cable network.
[00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:41.440]   And you're saying, how would we protect ISP's existence?
[00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:44.720]   Public policies or private policies, would we promote that?
[00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:49.120]   Well, and the FCC has talked about a set of standards where--
[00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:50.480]   FCC.
[00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:55.280]   We won't block traffic or we won't provide preferential routing.
[00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:58.480]   And yeah, John's point is that the phone companies--
[00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:03.880]   Verizon joined SBC in saying, why are these people having free
[00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:05.040]   carriage across our network?
[00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:06.200]   And from my perspective--
[00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:07.800]   I'm paying $50 a month.
[00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:09.520]   Well, the customer's paying $50 a month.
[00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:09.880]   Yeah.
[00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:11.120]   And--
[00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:12.800]   Oh, you're trying Google to be paying--
[00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:14.480]   The telco wants to double dip.
[00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:16.760]   The telco would like money from the content provider
[00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:17.320]   and the end user.
[00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:18.840]   Rag-rays is a very interesting point,
[00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:20.880]   because really, there's two things an ISP does.
[00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:22.200]   They provide the connectivity.
[00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:25.080]   It's like plugging into the wall and you get electricity.
[00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:27.560]   And they provide the service, whether you know--
[00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:28.800]   What sales?
[00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:32.800]   And that's the point is, as more and more third parties,
[00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:35.440]   like Yahoo and Google, end up providing the services
[00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:37.560]   that traditionally ISPs have provided,
[00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:38.920]   what do we need an ISP for?
[00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:40.200]   Why can't we just plug into the utility?
[00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:40.720]   And that's the thing.
[00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:41.280]   So the problem.
[00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:42.360]   That's been some of the problem.
[00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:44.080]   It needs to be--
[00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:48.640]   I don't want to say it, but it needs to be government owned.
[00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:49.400]   Sorry.
[00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:51.320]   It made me drop my alkaline water.
[00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:51.840]   What?
[00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:52.840]   Socialize?
[00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:53.920]   In that phone?
[00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:55.520]   Greg, have you known just--
[00:41:55.520 --> 00:41:56.160]   Verizon.
[00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:57.720]   He's getting more and more left.
[00:41:57.720 --> 00:41:58.360]   I don't know what's happening.
[00:41:58.360 --> 00:41:58.720]   Why am I not?
[00:41:58.720 --> 00:41:59.200]   I'm a right winger.
[00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:00.200]   I'm scared.
[00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:01.080]   I'm just telling you.
[00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:04.280]   He was the Michael Savage of computing for years.
[00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:06.560]   And all of a sudden, he started to sound like Bill Clinton.
[00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:09.400]   That's the last thing I thought you'd say, but--
[00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:10.440]   I think he's right.
[00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:12.080]   It's an interesting notion.
[00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:13.200]   Maybe not government.
[00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:13.760]   But maybe--
[00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:16.400]   It should be a utility like a water company.
[00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:17.360]   Well, those are regular--
[00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:19.800]   You should be able to plug into the wall and you get water.
[00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:21.360]   You can go to a hotel room.
[00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:22.600]   You turn it on to get water.
[00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:23.480]   You got free electricity.
[00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:24.520]   You can tell you should have free electricity.
[00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:25.200]   You do know what the--
[00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:28.840]   But you know what the number one internet service provider is
[00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:29.680]   in this country?
[00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:30.680]   Linksys.
[00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:33.400]   Number two, default.
[00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:35.880]   That's a gag that you might want to explain to the--
[00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:37.360]   Yeah, I don't have to explain it.
[00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:38.840]   I think it's not giving it in from Nick here.
[00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:39.960]   What am I logged into here?
[00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:40.440]   Oh, linksys.
[00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:41.440]   No, you're lying in here.
[00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:42.440]   Or you're in the linksys.
[00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:45.360]   It's like some guy across the street, you're poaching.
[00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:46.440]   Meaning that's your modem.
[00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:47.480]   But Dane defend yourself.
[00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:50.200]   Why should there be ISPs?
[00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:54.440]   Well, internet service providers are certainly innovating
[00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:57.960]   and driving the bandwidth to the high school.
[00:42:57.960 --> 00:43:00.400]   I am not complaining about guys like you.
[00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:02.520]   I think if there's all a bunch of little independents
[00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:04.760]   doing their job, I think that would be fantastic.
[00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:08.600]   But that's your endangered species.
[00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:08.960]   You know what?
[00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:10.400]   His business is better than ever.
[00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:10.920]   Yeah, we do.
[00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:12.360]   Well, that doesn't mean he's not an endangered species.
[00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:15.440]   The bigger he gets, the more likely AT&T will buy him out.
[00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:16.040]   Well, that's not so bad.
[00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:17.360]   That would be just so much more money.
[00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:21.080]   You will not be able to resist the allure of a big check.
[00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:22.680]   What kind of car did you drive down here today?
[00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:24.040]   A Prius.
[00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:25.480]   You used to have a fancy-- you still
[00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:26.520]   have the Linux license plate.
[00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:27.000]   I do.
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:27.520]   All right.
[00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:28.720]   It was as a Prius too.
[00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:30.160]   Everybody's been a Prius.
[00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:32.240]   And he's got an underage one.
[00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:33.400]   In the business, he has the Linux.
[00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:33.920]   We have the Linux.
[00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:34.920]   We have the Linux.
[00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:35.880]   Sorry, I forgot that.
[00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:38.320]   We-- John and I drive Lexuses.
[00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:38.840]   Right.
[00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:40.320]   A fine automobile, by the way.
[00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:44.000]   I like them.
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:44.880]   Is that a little blatant?
[00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:45.320]   I don't know.
[00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:46.240]   But do you have a laser?
[00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:48.320]   Well, one thing that's really troubling
[00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:53.760]   is that Wi-Fi didn't become free, open many cities.
[00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:55.720]   And that seems to be a real market failure.
[00:43:55.720 --> 00:43:57.080]   That a clear service.
[00:43:57.080 --> 00:43:58.440]   I mean, it seems like we've gone backwards.
[00:43:58.440 --> 00:43:59.760]   Well, Philadelphia is the best example,
[00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:01.280]   because the big companies just fought against it.
[00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:01.840]   Yeah, gangdup.
[00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:02.880]   They want to pass laws.
[00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:04.920]   And so it seems like there are examples with Ben
[00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:06.840]   with where we're going backwards in the US.
[00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:09.520]   We're numbers sweat 14, 15, 16.
[00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:10.600]   We're down on the list.
[00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:12.080]   We're not even close in per capita.
[00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:14.600]   I mean, you have a point, John, in that you look at countries
[00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:18.920]   where the telephony system is entirely government run.
[00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:22.200]   And in that environment, everybody had a phone line.
[00:44:22.200 --> 00:44:23.480]   And then the internet came along.
[00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:24.720]   They wanted another one.
[00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:27.800]   And another phone line meant more capacity.
[00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:31.560]   And pushing over to DSL, where both are carried over one line,
[00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:35.840]   was the right thing to do for the costs of running that service.
[00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:37.680]   And the side effect is it's darn fast.
[00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:38.200]   So a lot of countries--
[00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:40.320]   Yeah, well, they're using X DSL and some of these high speed
[00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:41.320]   DSLs in most of the country.
[00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:43.520]   And in Sweden, I can get 30 megabits per second.
[00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:45.160]   So a lot of these countries got ahead of us,
[00:44:45.160 --> 00:44:48.400]   because from an altruistic perspective,
[00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:50.560]   it was better and more cost effective.
[00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:52.960]   And delivered broadband and voice over the same amount.
[00:44:52.960 --> 00:44:55.160]   And how's that different than their own infrastructure?
[00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:57.040]   Because here, it's all about, is the consumer
[00:44:57.040 --> 00:44:58.000]   ready to pay for that?
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:44:58.280]   Right.
[00:44:58.280 --> 00:44:59.080]   We're competing.
[00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:02.880]   Companies are tripping over themselves to rip off the consumer.
[00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:05.040]   To get those number of people.
[00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:06.840]   They pay less in South Korea.
[00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:08.400]   They pay less in Japan.
[00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:09.280]   And they get more speed.
[00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:10.280]   And they get more speed.
[00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:11.040]   I don't understand.
[00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:12.000]   I think we are.
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:13.440]   We're getting ripped off.
[00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:17.120]   China, it was just announced, their internet population
[00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:19.320]   hit 111 people online.
[00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:20.400]   They're under 11 million.
[00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:22.800]   111 people online.
[00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:24.640]   All of the same internet cafe.
[00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:25.160]   All right.
[00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:26.280]   They're left out a few zeros.
[00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:26.840]   Yeah.
[00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:28.400]   111 million people online.
[00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:30.400]   That's the number two nation.
[00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:33.320]   And you can bet they don't have ISPs in China or do they?
[00:45:33.320 --> 00:45:34.000]   Yeah.
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:35.440]   I mean, it's all--
[00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:38.120]   It's government run and there's internet cafes.
[00:45:38.120 --> 00:45:40.280]   But 111 people being censored.
[00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:41.120]   111 million.
[00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:42.720]   111 people being censored.
[00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:43.800]   Well, and that's another point.
[00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:44.320]   That's right.
[00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:44.760]   No.
[00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:45.280]   Yeah.
[00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:45.960]   Oh, I don't know.
[00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:47.240]   I mean, if you think about it,
[00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:48.040]   I mean, that's all we're going to love.
[00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:49.080]   And you're very impressive.
[00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:51.360]   But you also have to think China has a population of 1
[00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:52.000]   plus billion.
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:53.000]   Yeah.
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:54.160]   And he's right about that.
[00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:56.840]   You know, I was in China for three weeks this summer.
[00:45:56.840 --> 00:45:58.720]   It's very clear the Chinese government
[00:45:58.720 --> 00:46:01.240]   has soured on the internet and is doing everything they
[00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:02.480]   can to slow penetration.
[00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:03.080]   As they should.
[00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:04.080]   It's anti-controlling.
[00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:05.080]   They can't control it.
[00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:05.720]   It is democratic.
[00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:06.200]   Yeah.
[00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:08.120]   They can control it to a point.
[00:46:08.120 --> 00:46:10.440]   And so they love the cell phone.
[00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:13.640]   They are loading everything into that cell phone
[00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:16.760]   because they know that with the cell phone,
[00:46:16.760 --> 00:46:19.440]   its surveillance is much easier.
[00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:21.720]   There's just two carriers in China.
[00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:24.520]   And so-- but it was surprising to me
[00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:26.720]   how much the brakes are put on the internet
[00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:28.280]   and how they're moving towards--
[00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:30.120]   They'll pass us up anyway.
[00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:32.080]   Even with the brakes on, they're going to pass us up.
[00:46:32.080 --> 00:46:32.880]   Oh, granted.
[00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:33.320]   Yeah.
[00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:33.520]   Yeah.
[00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:34.760]   I just think though, the down run--
[00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:35.120]   In the long run.
[00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:36.000]   They distort them.
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:36.720]   In the long run.
[00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:37.240]   I think it's--
[00:46:37.240 --> 00:46:39.040]   You do it at a price of the net.
[00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:40.000]   You do it at a price that I think--
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:41.080]   It's used through the cell phone.
[00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:43.560]   In the long run, the internet will be open there too.
[00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:44.120]   It has to be.
[00:46:44.120 --> 00:46:44.560]   It has to be.
[00:46:44.560 --> 00:46:45.280]   It's just inevitable.
[00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:47.880]   It's like water.
[00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:49.440]   What?
[00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:51.120]   Alkaline water.
[00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:53.520]   It penetrates.
[00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:54.560]   Do we want to move to another story?
[00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:59.400]   Did you see the brew-haha over Apple's Intel commercial?
[00:46:59.400 --> 00:46:59.960]   It's--
[00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:01.120]   It's insulting.
[00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:02.400]   Well, you've been insulting.
[00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:03.800]   But it's actually a rip off--
[00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:04.440]   You've insulted it.
[00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:09.120]   --of a video by a company called the Postal--
[00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:10.960]   a band called the Postal Service.
[00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:12.040]   It looks exactly the same.
[00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:13.280]   Now, it's the same director.
[00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:16.360]   But Postal Service, the band says, we're upset.
[00:47:16.360 --> 00:47:17.600]   It's recently come to our attention
[00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:19.440]   that Apple Computer's new television commercial
[00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:22.760]   for the Intel chip features a shot-for-shot recreation
[00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:24.520]   of our video.
[00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:26.480]   By the way, their music is not so hot.
[00:47:26.480 --> 00:47:27.440]   But the video was very good.
[00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:29.600]   We talk about the same film makers.
[00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:30.280]   You like--
[00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:31.600]   Well, sir, he's the same guy that--
[00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:33.560]   it's the side project that he did with--
[00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:34.680]   That he did outside of that.
[00:47:34.680 --> 00:47:36.120]   Oh, it's Death Factory Cutie?
[00:47:36.120 --> 00:47:36.920]   Same figure.
[00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:37.920]   Yeah.
[00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:40.400]   It's just the synth-o-pop crap.
[00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:40.840]   Whatever.
[00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:42.360]   Can't get in there.
[00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:42.880]   But--
[00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:44.280]   I actually got to tell us all the time.
[00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:49.120]   Made by the same film makers responsible for the original.
[00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:52.440]   We did not approve this commercial--
[00:47:52.440 --> 00:47:53.880]   What else we had to tie right now?
[00:47:53.880 --> 00:47:54.880]   That's Apple.
[00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:55.880]   It should be really upset with that.
[00:47:55.880 --> 00:47:56.440]   Next door.
[00:47:56.440 --> 00:47:57.280]   Next door.
[00:47:57.280 --> 00:47:59.800]   Because he-- well, here's what I think happened.
[00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:03.120]   Somebody at Apple, probably Steve, saw the video, said,
[00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:04.880]   hey, that's a great idea for an Intel.
[00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:06.440]   Hire the director.
[00:48:06.440 --> 00:48:09.080]   And Postal Service just miffed because they didn't have--
[00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:10.440]   Didn't get a chance to change.
[00:48:10.440 --> 00:48:11.680]   It should have been in the thing.
[00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:13.520]   802.11.
[00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:13.920]   And--
[00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:14.640]   This is just a number?
[00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:15.120]   And.
[00:48:15.120 --> 00:48:15.880]   Yeah.
[00:48:15.880 --> 00:48:16.480]   It's about time.
[00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:18.960]   600 megabits.
[00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:21.560]   And it's now on its way to approval.
[00:48:21.560 --> 00:48:23.400]   We're going to see it this year.
[00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:24.360]   It seems to work.
[00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:24.880]   No, not really.
[00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:25.240]   6.
[00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:26.280]   Have you played with it at all?
[00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:27.000]   Yeah.
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:27.640]   Yeah.
[00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:28.000]   It does work.
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:29.200]   It's heck a lot better than what we have on our phone.
[00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:30.680]   I've been using the free-end stuff for a while,
[00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:31.600]   and it works great.
[00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:32.600]   So it is a multi-end.
[00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:34.600]   It's my-mo.
[00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:35.840]   That seems to be the key.
[00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:38.280]   But 600 megabits?
[00:48:38.280 --> 00:48:39.240]   Yeah.
[00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:39.840]   How many channels does that--
[00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:41.240]   What are you going to connect it to?
[00:48:41.240 --> 00:48:42.240]   So using one channel.
[00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:43.720]   Yes, it's every second.
[00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:44.360]   Every ninth of it.
[00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:45.240]   Only one channel.
[00:48:45.240 --> 00:48:45.760]   Whoa.
[00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:47.320]   They again vented this thing where
[00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:48.920]   they can send the same signal on one channel,
[00:48:48.920 --> 00:48:49.760]   on top of each other.
[00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:52.080]   And it's like-- it reminds me a little bit
[00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:54.680]   of wave division multiplexing in the fiber.
[00:48:54.680 --> 00:48:57.760]   Where they had so much capacity, and somebody invented this other thing.
[00:48:57.760 --> 00:48:59.520]   Well, when it was more--
[00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:02.880]   Turn the half the country dark because you don't need all this fiber.
[00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:04.360]   Because it multiplied it by 16.
[00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:07.800]   This multiplies it by-- I don't know how many radios they can run it once.
[00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:09.280]   But I know they do three now.
[00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:10.640]   What about interference with--
[00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:11.800]   That's the point.
[00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:14.000]   They've got the interference thing busted.
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:14.800]   So this is the--
[00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:15.320]   There's just no problem--
[00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:17.440]   So if you've been using a pre-end with the--
[00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:18.880]   Is it the Atheros chipset?
[00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:20.480]   That's the good chipset?
[00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:22.680]   It's the-- no, it's the-- the Aergos.
[00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:23.180]   Aergos.
[00:49:23.180 --> 00:49:24.520]   So if you've been using a pre-end with the Aergos,
[00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:26.320]   that's pretty much what you're going to see with the--
[00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:28.640]   The Atheros, all of them are going to be using the same technology.
[00:49:28.640 --> 00:49:31.000]   But right now, Aergos, the ones that are out there,
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:33.640]   including the Belkin and some of these others, you can get those.
[00:49:33.640 --> 00:49:34.800]   And they're running at 240.
[00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:35.800]   I think there's a full 100--
[00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:37.920]   So if we get this kind of bandwidth, then
[00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:39.920]   are we just going to get movies over?
[00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:43.600]   And I mean, what are we going to shove through these pipes?
[00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:45.200]   Say we're going to get 600 megabits.
[00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:46.560]   Which, of course, is optimal.
[00:49:46.560 --> 00:49:48.360]   It'll be probably more like 300.
[00:49:48.360 --> 00:49:49.000]   Who knows what.
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:49.920]   But what do we get in?
[00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:50.920]   What do we get now?
[00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:52.000]   What do we get now?
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:52.360]   You know what?
[00:49:52.360 --> 00:49:54.280]   You have your home network that everyone
[00:49:54.280 --> 00:49:56.600]   wants to put all their media in one single storage
[00:49:56.600 --> 00:49:57.800]   and then stir it up.
[00:49:57.800 --> 00:50:00.520]   Yeah, because you only need 10 megabits per second
[00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:03.120]   to run HDTV across the--
[00:50:03.120 --> 00:50:03.760]   Over the wide.
[00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:04.600]   And ISP's.
[00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:06.200]   I've been lucky to get six megabits.
[00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:07.200]   What am I going to do with this?
[00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:08.360]   No, no, I'm saying within the home,
[00:50:08.360 --> 00:50:09.880]   you can have this flash up.
[00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:12.360]   And then you can have-- you can do some download and play
[00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:14.560]   off the internet for IPTV purposes.
[00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:16.720]   And then you can route it right to your television scene.
[00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:19.640]   Dan Sonicnet was very early into the wireless.
[00:50:19.640 --> 00:50:22.400]   I know you were doing wireless to downtown Santa Rosa.
[00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:24.200]   You're now wiring some of the communities
[00:50:24.200 --> 00:50:26.320]   in Northern California.
[00:50:26.320 --> 00:50:31.840]   We've had an aggressive, try it out wireless policy.
[00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:33.400]   You moved in?
[00:50:33.400 --> 00:50:34.080]   We haven't yet.
[00:50:34.080 --> 00:50:36.960]   We've certainly experimented with some end products.
[00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:37.760]   How about Wi-Max?
[00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:39.200]   Is that a better solution for it?
[00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:41.920]   Well, right now, there's been some certification changes
[00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:44.760]   in Wi-Max recently in the 3.5 frequency, which
[00:50:44.760 --> 00:50:46.280]   is not available in the US.
[00:50:46.280 --> 00:50:48.280]   They're talking about 5.8 products that
[00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:50.440]   will be supported in the US late this year.
[00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:53.760]   So we haven't seen anything except licensed frequency
[00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:55.000]   stuff in the Wi-Max.
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:55.520]   But--
[00:50:55.520 --> 00:50:57.160]   That's exactly-- I think that's going to be the way it's going
[00:50:57.160 --> 00:50:57.480]   to be.
[00:50:57.480 --> 00:50:59.680]   Well, and I think that the challenge
[00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:02.360]   as the telecom companies and as the cable companies
[00:51:02.360 --> 00:51:04.320]   have woken up to the potential of the internet
[00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:09.360]   and seized control, so to speak, of that last mile,
[00:51:09.360 --> 00:51:11.840]   internet providers are really seeking to find other ways.
[00:51:11.840 --> 00:51:13.600]   And wireless is one of those potential outlets.
[00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:16.320]   So we've tried one technology after another after another
[00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:18.440]   and found that many of them don't work.
[00:51:18.440 --> 00:51:20.920]   And you're talking about the potential of Wi-Fi,
[00:51:20.920 --> 00:51:23.160]   and why isn't there wireless internet everywhere
[00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:23.840]   and ought to be free?
[00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:25.760]   You'd have to have an enormous mesh.
[00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:26.320]   It's a real problem.
[00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:27.680]   Well, and we've tried mesh products
[00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:31.520]   where we deploy equipment on a light pole on every city block.
[00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:34.000]   And it doesn't work very well.
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:34.760]   Oh, sorry.
[00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:35.960]   There's so many of the problems--
[00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:37.120]   So we talk about--
[00:51:37.120 --> 00:51:38.800]   Yeah, so we talk about Philadelphia,
[00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:40.440]   and we talk about the technology that they're
[00:51:40.440 --> 00:51:41.360]   going to be using.
[00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:44.080]   And I haven't seen this stuff really work
[00:51:44.080 --> 00:51:45.720]   in a real city environment.
[00:51:45.720 --> 00:51:47.960]   Have you played with the pre-end stuff, though?
[00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:48.720]   What do you think of that?
[00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:51.160]   We've played with pre-end stuff, and it seems to me that--
[00:51:51.160 --> 00:51:52.440]   It gets more distances by--
[00:51:52.440 --> 00:51:54.000]   Yeah, MIMO fixes a lot of the issues.
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:55.960]   And it isn't about getting 600 megabits
[00:51:55.960 --> 00:51:58.000]   when you're three feet away from the base station.
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:00.880]   It's being half a block, two blocks away, in a cafe,
[00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:05.040]   behind a brick earthquake, seismically reinforced wall,
[00:52:05.040 --> 00:52:07.680]   and still getting two megabits, which today,
[00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:09.000]   you're not getting with any technology.
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:09.520]   Get on zero.
[00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:11.320]   Yes.
[00:52:11.320 --> 00:52:12.760]   Is there a solution that we're doing?
[00:52:12.760 --> 00:52:15.000]   Well, so the MIMO fixes a lot of that.
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:17.480]   And it takes advantages of the problems.
[00:52:17.480 --> 00:52:18.040]   I like to see it.
[00:52:18.040 --> 00:52:19.680]   Or it's actually MIMO, I think.
[00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:20.440]   MIMO, MIMO.
[00:52:20.440 --> 00:52:21.400]   But MIMO--
[00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:23.000]   You say MIMO, I say MIMO.
[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:28.080]   The MIMO technology would be interesting
[00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:31.720]   if they put it on top of YMAX.
[00:52:31.720 --> 00:52:32.240]   That's--
[00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:33.480]   It's called MyMax.
[00:52:33.480 --> 00:52:34.600]   MyMax.
[00:52:34.600 --> 00:52:35.840]   YMAX, I don't know.
[00:52:35.840 --> 00:52:36.440]   Who names this stuff?
[00:52:36.440 --> 00:52:37.560]   It just seems to me--
[00:52:37.560 --> 00:52:38.760]   I don't know, these names.
[00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:40.800]   My MIMO Max.
[00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:42.360]   Well, it's an important point, you raise,
[00:52:42.360 --> 00:52:44.920]   because I think there's been this growing sense that there's
[00:52:44.920 --> 00:52:49.080]   some conspiracy that's keeping Wi-Fi from public places.
[00:52:49.080 --> 00:52:52.400]   But you're saying it's really a technical issue that--
[00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:53.800]   The technology is not mature--
[00:52:53.800 --> 00:52:54.160]   Pescue.
[00:52:54.160 --> 00:52:57.120]   --wide area, in my opinion, in our testing.
[00:52:57.120 --> 00:52:59.120]   And when you're talking about a cafe,
[00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:01.480]   and you're putting a good access point in a cafe back
[00:53:01.480 --> 00:53:02.960]   fed with a T1 or a DSL circuit--
[00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:03.440]   What kind?
[00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:04.360]   --it works great in the cafe.
[00:53:04.360 --> 00:53:06.240]   What kind of power are we talking about?
[00:53:06.240 --> 00:53:08.720]   Because you can get-- it seems to me--
[00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:12.080]   I mean, these are milliamp radios, generally speaking.
[00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:13.920]   With high-gain antennas, we're talking
[00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:15.200]   about a full watt of output.
[00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:16.880]   Oh, you go-- so you're using a full watt
[00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:17.720]   with a big antenna?
[00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:18.220]   Yeah.
[00:53:18.220 --> 00:53:19.280]   And the trouble there is--
[00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:19.720]   I'm going right back.
[00:53:19.720 --> 00:53:20.080]   --you've got--
[00:53:20.080 --> 00:53:21.080]   I'm going to go too much.
[00:53:21.080 --> 00:53:22.640]   --in the water.
[00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:23.440]   You know, the trouble--
[00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:24.360]   It's very interesting.
[00:53:24.360 --> 00:53:26.240]   --the trouble with that then is you've--
[00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:29.160]   in addition to an amplified output,
[00:53:29.160 --> 00:53:31.320]   you've got what you call a big ear.
[00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:33.600]   You're hearing a lot of noise in the environment.
[00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:35.520]   So your noise floor goes up, and every microwave
[00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:37.200]   oven in three city blocks.
[00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:38.120]   And then all the--
[00:53:38.120 --> 00:53:39.720]   How does that actually-- no.
[00:53:39.720 --> 00:53:41.120]   You know, one thing I was wondering about--
[00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:42.600]   you just have all these wireless products.
[00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:46.000]   I mean, aren't you just making a huge EM cloud that someday
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:47.000]   is going to interfere with something?
[00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:48.440]   It's amazing that it works at all.
[00:53:48.440 --> 00:53:49.120]   Yeah, I'm just about--
[00:53:49.120 --> 00:53:50.120]   But it does.
[00:53:50.120 --> 00:53:52.840]   I'm like someone's pacemaker just goes, you know,
[00:53:52.840 --> 00:53:56.120]   some guys say, well, your broadband wireless access
[00:53:56.120 --> 00:54:00.160]   is responsible for giving my stun to heart attack.
[00:54:00.160 --> 00:54:02.600]   Well, we're talking about much lower power output
[00:54:02.600 --> 00:54:05.400]   than a walkie-talkie, much, much lower power output
[00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:07.240]   than a cell phone.
[00:54:07.240 --> 00:54:11.440]   You know, certainly a cell tower puts out a ton of power.
[00:54:11.440 --> 00:54:13.280]   And so the Wi-Fi standard says, you know,
[00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:14.400]   these power levels very low.
[00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:17.280]   The antenna gain is very low.
[00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:19.640]   And so there are standards that are
[00:54:19.640 --> 00:54:21.960]   compared to some of the other sources of EMF.
[00:54:21.960 --> 00:54:24.280]   It's a really small number.
[00:54:24.280 --> 00:54:26.800]   Especially as you look at high-tension overhead lines
[00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:27.760]   at hundreds of thousands of--
[00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:29.480]   Well, not yet, but now that I've noticed--
[00:54:29.480 --> 00:54:31.600]   this is another thing that kind of baffles me.
[00:54:31.600 --> 00:54:33.800]   But I've noticed there's been more and more products
[00:54:33.800 --> 00:54:38.160]   that are a power line distribution systems.
[00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:40.160]   In fact, Netgear just came out with one of the supposed
[00:54:40.160 --> 00:54:41.880]   of these 85 megabits per second.
[00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:43.360]   And you plug it in the wall.
[00:54:43.360 --> 00:54:44.880]   And then, you know, your next--
[00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:46.800]   This internet over power lines.
[00:54:46.800 --> 00:54:47.480]   I mean, you know, the--
[00:54:47.480 --> 00:54:48.480]   Or something, or something.
[00:54:48.480 --> 00:54:49.560]   Yeah, it's like an EPL.
[00:54:49.560 --> 00:54:50.560]   EPL.
[00:54:50.560 --> 00:54:51.200]   The problem--
[00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:51.920]   Big issues with that.
[00:54:51.920 --> 00:54:52.920]   I mean, the way it has.
[00:54:52.920 --> 00:54:54.040]   The ham's are ham's are ham's are in BPL.
[00:54:54.040 --> 00:54:56.240]   Because it sends all kinds of radiation into the three--
[00:54:56.240 --> 00:54:59.840]   Well, it turns the grid into a big, whole transmitter.
[00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:02.000]   And so you have the notch of the frequencies
[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:03.480]   that you want to protect.
[00:55:03.480 --> 00:55:06.080]   And it's-- now, we saw a demo at the FCC Labs.
[00:55:06.080 --> 00:55:07.040]   I think you were with me.
[00:55:07.040 --> 00:55:08.960]   Weren't you, David, when we went to the FCC Labs?
[00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:10.680]   No, I was working on COFRAL.
[00:55:10.680 --> 00:55:12.360]   OK.
[00:55:12.360 --> 00:55:14.720]   We saw a demo where they notch it and so forth.
[00:55:14.720 --> 00:55:17.160]   And you know, Michael Powell was a big fan of BPL.
[00:55:17.160 --> 00:55:19.400]   But I noticed that BPL has not really--
[00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:21.120]   I think he's just the way to spy on the public.
[00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:22.480]   I've always known that.
[00:55:22.480 --> 00:55:25.320]   But honestly, we do have to wire the rural areas.
[00:55:25.320 --> 00:55:26.240]   That's really an issue.
[00:55:26.240 --> 00:55:27.920]   It's becoming more and more of an issue.
[00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:29.160]   If you're in an urban area, you've
[00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:31.600]   got two or three good choices for high speed internet.
[00:55:31.600 --> 00:55:32.720]   If you're in a rural area--
[00:55:32.720 --> 00:55:34.800]   You're lucky to get 19 to dial up.
[00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:35.320]   Yeah, if you're lucky.
[00:55:35.320 --> 00:55:38.120]   Yeah, and developing countries in Africa and elsewhere
[00:55:38.120 --> 00:55:40.720]   are looking at this internet on power lines.
[00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:43.080]   Because at least they have an often urban--
[00:55:43.080 --> 00:55:45.720]   I'm convinced that the real reason for internet
[00:55:45.720 --> 00:55:48.800]   on power lines, why the technology continued to be developed,
[00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:52.000]   is because at some point in the future, all our appliances,
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:53.960]   the refrigerator, the washing machine,
[00:55:53.960 --> 00:55:55.800]   will all be hooked up with--
[00:55:55.800 --> 00:55:57.160]   they'll all have IP addresses.
[00:55:57.160 --> 00:55:58.680]   And they'll be hooked to the power line.
[00:55:58.680 --> 00:56:01.160]   And then you'll have advertisements on your washing machine.
[00:56:01.160 --> 00:56:03.680]   And you better not buy hummus because they'll be at your door.
[00:56:03.680 --> 00:56:04.960]   No, no, but you're right.
[00:56:04.960 --> 00:56:07.560]   That's been the great hope of the electricity company
[00:56:07.560 --> 00:56:10.280]   and the kitchen of the future.
[00:56:10.280 --> 00:56:12.080]   Yeah, the appliances will be talking to us,
[00:56:12.080 --> 00:56:14.240]   trying to sell us stuff, spying on us.
[00:56:14.240 --> 00:56:17.440]   And it'll be all brought to you by Google.
[00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:19.120]   Google refrigerator sense.
[00:56:19.120 --> 00:56:20.000]   It's an business product.
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:21.000]   But think about it.
[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:24.600]   You can get a free refrigerator if you let it broadcast ads
[00:56:24.600 --> 00:56:25.440]   in your kitchen.
[00:56:25.440 --> 00:56:26.280]   OK.
[00:56:26.280 --> 00:56:26.800]   OK.
[00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:27.440]   There's a business--
[00:56:27.440 --> 00:56:28.480]   A lot of people are going to take that.
[00:56:28.480 --> 00:56:29.720]   Philip K. Dick was right.
[00:56:29.720 --> 00:56:31.000]   Remember that story?
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:35.440]   That free toaster if it tells you a new ad each morning.
[00:56:35.440 --> 00:56:37.200]   Every time we put in toast, it says--
[00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:39.840]   Bigger than sappy toasters and refrigerators.
[00:56:39.840 --> 00:56:40.840]   You never know.
[00:56:40.840 --> 00:56:42.640]   We get some good stuff for free now.
[00:56:42.640 --> 00:56:44.360]   I think that you're absolutely right, though,
[00:56:44.360 --> 00:56:48.400]   that they've used the cover of conservation.
[00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:50.840]   They want to be able to shut off these things
[00:56:50.840 --> 00:56:52.640]   if you leave the house and forget to.
[00:56:52.640 --> 00:56:53.160]   Yeah.
[00:56:53.160 --> 00:56:55.080]   But you're right.
[00:56:55.080 --> 00:56:56.440]   You're right.
[00:56:56.440 --> 00:56:59.680]   Why would the power company support a technology
[00:56:59.680 --> 00:57:01.080]   that allows you to use less power?
[00:57:01.080 --> 00:57:01.920]   I don't think so.
[00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:03.320]   No, I turn it on while you're gone.
[00:57:03.320 --> 00:57:05.160]   They turn it on while you're gone.
[00:57:05.160 --> 00:57:06.200]   The house is all lit up.
[00:57:06.200 --> 00:57:07.480]   Who left the lights on?
[00:57:07.480 --> 00:57:09.320]   Why, that's not how you get the turn off the lights.
[00:57:09.320 --> 00:57:11.360]   You understand, that's the security service.
[00:57:11.360 --> 00:57:13.240]   Oh, someone was outside, so we decided to turn it
[00:57:13.240 --> 00:57:14.640]   all the lights and make--
[00:57:14.640 --> 00:57:17.000]   I do think, actually, that really what's going on with BPL
[00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:19.800]   is that the power companies are lobbying very hard
[00:57:19.800 --> 00:57:20.880]   to become internet service.
[00:57:20.880 --> 00:57:21.880]   Because everyone wants--
[00:57:21.880 --> 00:57:22.720]   We've got copper.
[00:57:22.720 --> 00:57:23.880]   We've got copper too.
[00:57:23.880 --> 00:57:25.080]   Everyone wants money.
[00:57:25.080 --> 00:57:27.280]   And if she can't--
[00:57:27.280 --> 00:57:29.200]   Well, it's the third conduit.
[00:57:29.200 --> 00:57:31.000]   It's the third conductor into the house.
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:33.360]   You've got your coax, your TV, you've
[00:57:33.360 --> 00:57:37.320]   got your traditional pots, voice, and then you've got your power.
[00:57:37.320 --> 00:57:38.440]   And so it makes sense that--
[00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:41.040]   You've got the bug that the BPL landed.
[00:57:41.040 --> 00:57:42.240]   It's not a big conduit.
[00:57:42.240 --> 00:57:43.680]   But it's been sharing some alcohol.
[00:57:43.680 --> 00:57:46.160]   I went to Kansas City 10 years ago
[00:57:46.160 --> 00:57:48.560]   when they were talking about getting rid of the meter
[00:57:48.560 --> 00:57:50.080]   readers using the--
[00:57:50.080 --> 00:57:51.080]   Yeah, well, there's a lot of products.
[00:57:51.080 --> 00:57:52.640]   You do have a lot of products like that.
[00:57:52.640 --> 00:57:54.200]   But it just hasn't taken on.
[00:57:54.200 --> 00:57:54.960]   A lot of places are going to be--
[00:57:54.960 --> 00:57:55.800]   No, there's a lot of places.
[00:57:55.800 --> 00:57:57.640]   You do have the radio based.
[00:57:57.640 --> 00:57:59.280]   One more story, and then we got to leave my bedroom.
[00:57:59.280 --> 00:57:59.800]   Really?
[00:57:59.800 --> 00:58:00.200]   Don't you think?
[00:58:00.200 --> 00:58:01.160]   How long we been going?
[00:58:01.160 --> 00:58:02.120]   Too long.
[00:58:02.120 --> 00:58:04.240]   Well, if you didn't go to the bathroom--
[00:58:04.240 --> 00:58:06.400]   It would be so long that you went to the bathroom.
[00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:07.920]   Yeah, I went to the bathroom.
[00:58:07.920 --> 00:58:10.600]   I mean, I think the show is nearly over.
[00:58:10.600 --> 00:58:11.120]   Yeah.
[00:58:11.120 --> 00:58:17.120]   Digital music sales tripled in 2005, $1.1 billion up
[00:58:17.120 --> 00:58:20.800]   from $380 million in 2004.
[00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:22.880]   That's weird to me, because it seemed to me that these guys
[00:58:22.880 --> 00:58:26.000]   said that people only wanted to steal music online.
[00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:27.000]   Well, now what they're saying is--
[00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:27.960]   They're only actually buy it.
[00:58:27.960 --> 00:58:29.360]   They're declaring victory.
[00:58:29.360 --> 00:58:30.000]   Who's they?
[00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:31.560]   The record industry.
[00:58:31.560 --> 00:58:34.800]   They're saying, well, look, because what happened was we've
[00:58:34.800 --> 00:58:36.040]   got 20,000--
[00:58:36.040 --> 00:58:40.680]   count them-- 20,000 lawsuits out there now in 17 countries.
[00:58:40.680 --> 00:58:43.960]   And that has cast a chill on piracy.
[00:58:43.960 --> 00:58:45.800]   And that's the stick.
[00:58:45.800 --> 00:58:48.160]   We've got the carrot, which is iTunes Music Store, which
[00:58:48.160 --> 00:58:49.840]   is number one, but a number of other music stores.
[00:58:49.840 --> 00:58:52.240]   We've got a good way for people to safely buy music.
[00:58:52.240 --> 00:58:53.160]   Well, you know--
[00:58:53.160 --> 00:58:55.400]   But overall, music sales are way down.
[00:58:55.400 --> 00:58:57.520]   Did you hear about the kids at Amherst and University of
[00:58:57.520 --> 00:58:59.800]   Massachusetts, or you just broke it before we started the
[00:58:59.800 --> 00:59:01.760]   show, which is they're suing?
[00:59:01.760 --> 00:59:05.840]   They got sued by the RIA for some $100,000, so they're
[00:59:05.840 --> 00:59:08.840]   suing the P2P software guy.
[00:59:08.840 --> 00:59:09.640]   They're blaming them.
[00:59:09.640 --> 00:59:10.480]   They're blaming them.
[00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:11.600]   It's your fault, Brockster.
[00:59:11.600 --> 00:59:13.240]   You did it to me.
[00:59:13.240 --> 00:59:16.040]   I'm going to do one guy and get some guy that was on the--
[00:59:16.040 --> 00:59:18.480]   I'm waiting for somebody to sue World Poker Tour, because he
[00:59:18.480 --> 00:59:21.160]   was going to college, then he got hooked on poker, and now
[00:59:21.160 --> 00:59:21.680]   it's all over.
[00:59:21.680 --> 00:59:22.840]   It's going to happen.
[00:59:22.840 --> 00:59:26.520]   You must get regular letters from the RIA.
[00:59:26.520 --> 00:59:27.800]   You know, we don't.
[00:59:27.800 --> 00:59:28.280]   You don't?
[00:59:28.280 --> 00:59:29.800]   No, we don't.
[00:59:29.800 --> 00:59:33.080]   And I was actually real surprised by that, because I
[00:59:33.080 --> 00:59:35.920]   had expected that we'd begin to see those--
[00:59:35.920 --> 00:59:38.080]   I've been told by some cable companies that, yeah, we get
[00:59:38.080 --> 00:59:38.960]   a letter.
[00:59:38.960 --> 00:59:42.280]   We then contact the customer, and we say, we've been asked
[00:59:42.280 --> 00:59:43.360]   to tell you to shut down.
[00:59:43.360 --> 00:59:47.000]   I was once contacted by Comcast in an error, it seemed to
[00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:47.320]   me.
[00:59:47.320 --> 00:59:51.080]   But yeah, but I think it's this area is more sophisticated.
[00:59:51.080 --> 00:59:55.160]   No, I was sent a letter saying, you should explain why this
[00:59:55.160 --> 00:59:55.880]   happened.
[00:59:55.880 --> 00:59:56.360]   What happened?
[00:59:56.360 --> 00:59:58.360]   As you know, I can barely use email.
[00:59:58.360 --> 01:00:01.000]   So I was quite puzzled.
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.880]   What could have happened?
[01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:03.400]   But maybe--
[01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:03.880]   Maybe the--
[01:00:03.880 --> 01:00:06.080]   Maybe the link-sis was doing.
[01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:09.600]   Maybe the Bay Area is so sophisticated that--
[01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:10.560]   They know how to hide better.
[01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:14.880]   Yeah, well, actually, to clarify, we're not seeing lawsuits
[01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:15.920]   and subpoenas.
[01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:17.960]   We are seeing a lot of DMCA notices.
[01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:18.520]   DMCA tapes.
[01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:19.000]   You do get those.
[01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:20.120]   We get those constantly.
[01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:21.040]   Yeah, that's what I thought about.
[01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:23.920]   It's a full-time employee who's just dealing with that.
[01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:25.080]   And so what--
[01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:25.920]   Squashing spam.
[01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:27.520]   Give us an example of how that works.
[01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:30.240]   Well, you have someone who's running a P2P application at
[01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:32.320]   home or a web server at home.
[01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:37.160]   And the IP address is ours, so we receive a notice.
[01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:39.480]   What would he have on there that they would be objecting to
[01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:40.680]   is it a blogger that--
[01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:41.160]   Movies?
[01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:42.000]   No, movies.
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:42.440]   Movies.
[01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:43.160]   Yeah, I mean--
[01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:43.960]   Oh, geez, excuse me.
[01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:44.440]   I gotta go.
[01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:44.960]   It's--
[01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:46.600]   I bet you do.
[01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:48.920]   It's for the $30,000 name from it.
[01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:49.520]   It's software.
[01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:49.960]   It's movies.
[01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:50.720]   It's music.
[01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:52.800]   And they're saying, take this off your servers.
[01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:55.320]   And the way that DMC has written, it's not on our servers.
[01:00:55.320 --> 01:00:56.280]   We're a conduit.
[01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:59.400]   And we're not required to provide any information about
[01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:00.000]   the subscriber.
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.960]   And we can't take it down because it's not on our network.
[01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:04.360]   So we sent a courtesy notice to the customer.
[01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:05.200]   No, they're watching.
[01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:07.000]   There's something around happening here.
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.120]   And maybe the next thing might be a subpoena.
[01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:12.240]   But the response to the sender is, I'm sorry, we don't
[01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:13.040]   have any information on this person.
[01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:16.240]   So you haven't yet received a letter saying, we're going to--
[01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:16.920]   we're going to sue.
[01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:18.920]   We have a John Doe lawsuit or something.
[01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:19.720]   No, we haven't seen that.
[01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:20.280]   We haven't gotten any.
[01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:20.840]   We haven't seen that.
[01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:26.760]   If I were to put up, I mean, I've started copying movies.
[01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:28.200]   When I rent home use--
[01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:29.200]   You don't have to start movies?
[01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:33.120]   Now let's say I would turn around and offer that on a
[01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:34.120]   website.
[01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:37.960]   How quickly, how many hours or minutes or days would it
[01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:40.160]   take for them to shut me down?
[01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:41.520]   Just write them down.
[01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:43.200]   Just write them down.
[01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:45.200]   We see 20,000 lawsuits.
[01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:47.480]   There are hundreds of millions of people.
[01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:48.960]   It's like lightning striking.
[01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:49.440]   My thing.
[01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:50.440]   No, but what does he think?
[01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:52.120]   No, I mean, it's got to be more than that.
[01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:53.440]   I'll tell you a better chance.
[01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:57.560]   I'll tell you, sir, we had a customer on our network who had
[01:01:57.560 --> 01:02:01.960]   four enhanced DSL lines, six megabits each, which we sell
[01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:04.520]   that circuit for $49.95 a month.
[01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:06.080]   They're running their business on this.
[01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:09.760]   And their function was to scour the web for copy written
[01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:12.280]   content for their partners.
[01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:13.840]   To download the steal?
[01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:15.000]   No, no.
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:15.520]   They're looking for--
[01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:16.440]   They're the police.
[01:02:16.440 --> 01:02:19.680]   So they are out there scouring the internet for people
[01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:20.520]   sharing this content.
[01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:21.200]   So the idea is--
[01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:23.000]   Like what content?
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:24.280]   A movie that he just got--
[01:02:24.280 --> 01:02:26.600]   Yeah, say Lord of War.
[01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:30.560]   I just decide, hey, I'm going to distribute Lord of War.
[01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:32.720]   How quickly will they shut me down?
[01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:35.720]   Well, it depends on how widely it's distributed.
[01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:38.200]   And lots of people link to you.
[01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:39.600]   They're going to find you sooner.
[01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:40.600]   The more people are downloading--
[01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:41.960]   And sooner would mean a day.
[01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:43.960]   Send it to your mom, it seems unlike.
[01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:45.280]   I think it's so widespread.
[01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:46.880]   I think you're seeing--
[01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:50.400]   Even with 20,000 lawsuits, it's a--
[01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:52.400]   Well, then there's going to be a breaking point
[01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:53.400]   down in this country.
[01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:54.400]   I can't point down in this country.
[01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:55.080]   It's all just work.
[01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:56.480]   It's that widespread.
[01:02:56.480 --> 01:02:58.960]   You know, we look at net flows.
[01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:01.520]   We look at protocols flowing across our network.
[01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:05.480]   And I can tell you that BitTorrent and Usenet and NNTPR
[01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:08.160]   by far the two largest bandwidth picks.
[01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:08.960]   Oh, really?
[01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:09.720]   In these groups.
[01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:10.120]   And guess what?
[01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:12.080]   People are downloading movies from that.
[01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:13.080]   I don't know what they're doing.
[01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:14.000]   Shame on them.
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:18.720]   They're going to be doing movies, porn, wares, and Twitter.
[01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:19.720]   You're on--
[01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:20.720]   They're on--
[01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:21.720]   We're on the list.
[01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:22.720]   We're in a business--
[01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:24.920]   Because one of these paradoxes, because you see the legal
[01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:28.040]   business and the illegal business zooming.
[01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:29.960]   Because, I mean, DVD sales have just gone through the--
[01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:30.760]   They haven't heard them.
[01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:33.440]   Well, and you know, they're downloading music from--
[01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:33.960]   Here to pair.
[01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:35.720]   Music is getting more stuff from--
[01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:36.640]   Music is getting more--
[01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:38.640]   You know, the thing is DVDs, they've
[01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:40.520]   been smart enough to actually drop the prices.
[01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:41.200]   So really--
[01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:41.720]   They're cheap.
[01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:42.520]   And you get more?
[01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:45.320]   It's cheaper to buy the thing rather than sit around for like
[01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:47.040]   half a month waiting for the rest of the movie.
[01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:48.440]   Well, that's where the father's office is.
[01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:49.760]   That's six megabit television.
[01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:50.280]   It's awesome.
[01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:54.280]   The basement of the Capitol building in West Virginia,
[01:03:54.280 --> 01:04:00.680]   they discovered an entire piracy operation down there, $83,000
[01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:03.600]   with the computers purchased by the state of West Virginia.
[01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:03.920]   Really?
[01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:06.520]   Didn't they only have like 14 movies now?
[01:04:06.520 --> 01:04:07.800]   Well, it was a small--
[01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:08.440]   It was a small--
[01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:09.840]   But they were making a lot of copies.
[01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:10.840]   Very scandalous.
[01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:11.320]   Wow.
[01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:12.920]   The basement of the Capitol building.
[01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:13.520]   They had 14 movies.
[01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:14.520]   They were just--
[01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:15.600]   They're cranking it out?
[01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:16.600]   I can't vouch for that.
[01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:18.360]   I got 23 on a hard distance in my house.
[01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:19.320]   They have a good authority.
[01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:22.280]   I have a-- no, I can't vouch for the West Virginia, $83,000
[01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:23.040]   with the computers.
[01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:24.040]   Was it really 14 movies?
[01:04:24.040 --> 01:04:25.040]   It was a small quantity of movies.
[01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:25.960]   Amazing.
[01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:26.960]   That was a very popular movie.
[01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:28.560]   And you know, we've seen this in universities.
[01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:31.160]   Were there porn movies or there first run movies or just--
[01:04:31.160 --> 01:04:38.040]   It was a state employee who had had enough clout to requisition
[01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:40.040]   $83,000 with the computers.
[01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:42.240]   And they had to get an office in the basement of the West Virginia
[01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:43.480]   Capitol building to do this.
[01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:44.320]   Wow.
[01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:45.520]   This is a guy with some--
[01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:46.040]   This is--
[01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:46.720]   Well, the hobby--
[01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:47.240]   Oh, nice.
[01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:48.000]   That's the word.
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:48.880]   Sounds like a hobby.
[01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:50.360]   Wow, that's amazing.
[01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:51.960]   All right, I think with that--
[01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:52.520]   I don't think so too.
[01:04:52.520 --> 01:04:53.600]   We should probably wrap this up.
[01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:56.520]   One more story, which I think is relevant to us.
[01:04:56.520 --> 01:04:57.020]   From China.
[01:04:57.020 --> 01:04:57.920]   Is-- pardon me?
[01:04:57.920 --> 01:04:58.420]   No.
[01:04:58.420 --> 01:04:58.760]   Go ahead.
[01:04:58.760 --> 01:05:03.000]   When I was there was that story about the German Wikipedia
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:06.520]   getting shut down because of the hacker's name getting written.
[01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:07.320]   His last name.
[01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:08.040]   Now that's ridiculous.
[01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:08.920]   His parents sued.
[01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:10.440]   The kid's dead.
[01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:11.360]   The kid's dead.
[01:05:11.360 --> 01:05:12.080]   He passed away.
[01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:14.880]   He passed away would be the light phrase.
[01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:16.040]   Because of Wikipedia?
[01:05:16.040 --> 01:05:16.720]   No.
[01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:17.200]   No.
[01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:19.240]   But Wikipedia, there was an article about him with--
[01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:20.280]   Because he was a hacker.
[01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:21.200]   Revealed his last name.
[01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:22.080]   His parents were unhappy.
[01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:23.480]   They said, we don't want our son to be--
[01:05:23.480 --> 01:05:24.080]   Actually, they said, like--
[01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:25.080]   Why don't they just go in and hand it down?
[01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:26.800]   We don't want our son to be remembered like this.
[01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:28.600]   So we will sue Wikipedia.
[01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:31.600]   By the way, in Germany, it's Wikipedia.
[01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:33.520]   And they actually-- the German judge--
[01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:34.360]   temporary restraining.
[01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:36.360]   Very different free speech rule in Germany.
[01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:36.860]   Very.
[01:05:36.860 --> 01:05:39.340]   You can't do comparison ads there either.
[01:05:39.340 --> 01:05:39.820]   Really?
[01:05:39.820 --> 01:05:40.420]   No.
[01:05:40.420 --> 01:05:41.180]   You can't do it?
[01:05:41.180 --> 01:05:41.700]   No.
[01:05:41.700 --> 01:05:43.300]   Wow.
[01:05:43.300 --> 01:05:44.300]   That's wrong.
[01:05:44.300 --> 01:05:45.260]   We're the best.
[01:05:45.260 --> 01:05:45.760]   The one thing--
[01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:46.860]   I love this.
[01:05:46.860 --> 01:05:47.660]   We're number one.
[01:05:47.660 --> 01:05:49.820]   Who is Colonel Klink here?
[01:05:49.820 --> 01:05:53.460]   We should mention that this show is listened to in 43 nations.
[01:05:53.460 --> 01:05:54.940]   Many of them around the world.
[01:05:54.940 --> 01:05:56.540]   I used to drive a German car.
[01:05:56.540 --> 01:05:57.040]   So.
[01:05:57.040 --> 01:05:58.140]   He's did drive.
[01:05:58.140 --> 01:05:59.580]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:05:59.580 --> 01:06:00.580]   Do you think it's fit?
[01:06:00.580 --> 01:06:04.140]   To fit is how you say this.
[01:06:04.140 --> 01:06:05.780]   The last story was that Amazon is going
[01:06:05.780 --> 01:06:07.900]   to do its own TV show with Bill Maher.
[01:06:07.900 --> 01:06:08.740]   Yeah.
[01:06:08.740 --> 01:06:09.660]   I think this is--
[01:06:09.660 --> 01:06:11.540]   Is it going to be a tech show to compete with us?
[01:06:11.540 --> 01:06:12.620]   As long as it's not a tech show,
[01:06:12.620 --> 01:06:13.060]   I don't care.
[01:06:13.060 --> 01:06:16.060]   Bill Maher can do anything he darn well-rated.
[01:06:16.060 --> 01:06:17.020]   What do you think of Bill Maher?
[01:06:17.020 --> 01:06:19.820]   Do you have an opinion on Bill Maher?
[01:06:19.820 --> 01:06:20.860]   It used to be funny.
[01:06:20.860 --> 01:06:21.820]   He's not so funny.
[01:06:21.820 --> 01:06:22.380]   He's not as funny.
[01:06:22.380 --> 01:06:23.340]   He seems bitter.
[01:06:23.340 --> 01:06:24.780]   That's what I was going to say.
[01:06:24.780 --> 01:06:27.100]   He looks, he sounds, and looks like someone who's--
[01:06:27.100 --> 01:06:28.180]   you just look at his face.
[01:06:28.180 --> 01:06:28.660]   And it's looking--
[01:06:28.660 --> 01:06:30.620]   I'd like to see Bill Maher and Dennis Miller
[01:06:30.620 --> 01:06:31.700]   in a cage match.
[01:06:31.700 --> 01:06:32.860]   Yeah, be great.
[01:06:32.860 --> 01:06:35.020]   With John Daly doing the play-by-play.
[01:06:35.020 --> 01:06:35.900]   All right.
[01:06:35.900 --> 01:06:39.340]   Now, John Daly, I love Bill Maher.
[01:06:39.340 --> 01:06:41.540]   The guy that you want to watch is--
[01:06:41.540 --> 01:06:42.060]   John Stewart.
[01:06:42.060 --> 01:06:43.740]   John Stewart's the king, isn't he?
[01:06:43.740 --> 01:06:45.700]   How do real journalists feel about John Stewart?
[01:06:45.700 --> 01:06:46.820]   They like him.
[01:06:46.820 --> 01:06:50.260]   I think more of the problem is that he's really
[01:06:50.260 --> 01:06:53.220]   genuinely angry about what's happening to this country.
[01:06:53.220 --> 01:06:57.900]   And so he's sort of been pushed from comedy to despair.
[01:06:57.900 --> 01:07:01.820]   Stewart is just a gifted comedian, very bright.
[01:07:01.820 --> 01:07:03.460]   He's got his biases.
[01:07:03.460 --> 01:07:06.780]   But he has a real intelligent, convicted media.
[01:07:06.780 --> 01:07:07.820]   And he's funny.
[01:07:07.820 --> 01:07:08.180]   Yeah.
[01:07:08.180 --> 01:07:10.260]   And you know, you can get away with a lot of his funny.
[01:07:10.260 --> 01:07:10.660]   Yeah.
[01:07:10.660 --> 01:07:11.780]   And he does it gently.
[01:07:11.780 --> 01:07:12.580]   Well, because he's a real--
[01:07:12.580 --> 01:07:16.340]   He's been working for so long trying to find himself that--
[01:07:16.340 --> 01:07:18.460]   he's like-- he said the top of his game.
[01:07:18.460 --> 01:07:21.180]   He should actually be on a network making--
[01:07:21.180 --> 01:07:22.060]   He's not like--
[01:07:22.060 --> 01:07:23.020]   Oh, sure, he's making a good life.
[01:07:23.020 --> 01:07:24.140]   He's making a mill.
[01:07:24.140 --> 01:07:24.820]   Is that all?
[01:07:24.820 --> 01:07:25.180]   Yeah.
[01:07:25.180 --> 01:07:25.700]   Oh, that's sad.
[01:07:25.700 --> 01:07:26.700]   Well, you know, he has--
[01:07:26.700 --> 01:07:28.500]   There's local anchors making a mill.
[01:07:28.500 --> 01:07:29.700]   Sadly sad.
[01:07:29.700 --> 01:07:30.220]   That's what--
[01:07:30.220 --> 01:07:30.220]   Wow.
[01:07:30.220 --> 01:07:31.060]   You know what I mean?
[01:07:31.060 --> 01:07:32.060]   That's sad.
[01:07:32.060 --> 01:07:33.060]   No, wait a minute.
[01:07:33.060 --> 01:07:34.260]   So five years with you.
[01:07:34.260 --> 01:07:35.620]   He's after five years.
[01:07:35.620 --> 01:07:36.460]   He should be making--
[01:07:36.460 --> 01:07:38.300]   He should be making what Leno's making.
[01:07:38.300 --> 01:07:40.900]   He should be making like 14 to 20.
[01:07:40.900 --> 01:07:41.900]   My point is--
[01:07:41.900 --> 01:07:42.740]   My point is he's got some--
[01:07:42.740 --> 01:07:46.180]   His opening monologue often has echoes of Carson.
[01:07:46.180 --> 01:07:48.940]   I mean, we're old enough to remember Johnny Carson.
[01:07:48.940 --> 01:07:50.420]   He was quite political.
[01:07:50.420 --> 01:07:51.500]   And during the years--
[01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:53.260]   Stewart B. Sippie's letter--
[01:07:53.260 --> 01:07:54.140]   No, Stewart's the best.
[01:07:54.140 --> 01:07:55.420]   Letterman's lost it.
[01:07:55.420 --> 01:07:57.780]   He should be getting the Letterman Leno money.
[01:07:57.780 --> 01:07:58.420]   Well, he--
[01:07:58.420 --> 01:08:00.220]   He said he's going to Conan and brought money.
[01:08:00.220 --> 01:08:02.020]   Yeah, well, that's because he's on cable.
[01:08:02.020 --> 01:08:03.020]   Yeah.
[01:08:03.020 --> 01:08:04.020]   You know?
[01:08:04.020 --> 01:08:05.900]   He probably has more down, but you know, he gets a lot of stuff.
[01:08:05.900 --> 01:08:06.900]   We used to be on cable.
[01:08:06.900 --> 01:08:07.900]   We used to be on cable.
[01:08:07.900 --> 01:08:09.500]   We didn't make any money here.
[01:08:09.500 --> 01:08:10.940]   We couldn't even stay on cable.
[01:08:10.940 --> 01:08:11.940]   We saw--
[01:08:11.940 --> 01:08:12.940]   That's the problem with us.
[01:08:12.940 --> 01:08:14.740]   See, Johnny Stewart has a bad agent then.
[01:08:14.740 --> 01:08:15.940]   No, no, he's got a--
[01:08:15.940 --> 01:08:17.100]   That's good money for cable.
[01:08:17.100 --> 01:08:18.100]   Come on.
[01:08:18.100 --> 01:08:19.100]   I don't know.
[01:08:19.100 --> 01:08:20.100]   They did a very good money for you.
[01:08:20.100 --> 01:08:21.100]   Hell, they offered him hell, aren't you?
[01:08:21.100 --> 01:08:22.100]   He was on cable.
[01:08:22.100 --> 01:08:23.100]   Well, I know.
[01:08:23.100 --> 01:08:24.100]   That's substantial.
[01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:25.100]   That's your pale money.
[01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:26.100]   He had other--
[01:08:26.100 --> 01:08:27.100]   That could be promotional.
[01:08:27.100 --> 01:08:28.100]   I'm never--
[01:08:28.100 --> 01:08:29.100]   I've never been convinced that that was a real deal.
[01:08:29.100 --> 01:08:30.100]   Maybe Stewart's making more.
[01:08:30.100 --> 01:08:31.580]   Maybe he's making 20.
[01:08:31.580 --> 01:08:32.580]   I don't think so.
[01:08:32.580 --> 01:08:34.060]   Johnny, come on the show.
[01:08:34.060 --> 01:08:35.060]   Talk about it.
[01:08:35.060 --> 01:08:36.060]   We love you, babe.
[01:08:36.060 --> 01:08:37.060]   And buy a pickup dinner.
[01:08:37.060 --> 01:08:38.900]   Yeah, we need some of it.
[01:08:38.900 --> 01:08:40.900]   Did you not like the Indian food we got?
[01:08:40.900 --> 01:08:42.260]   The Indian food was okay.
[01:08:42.260 --> 01:08:43.260]   He was--
[01:08:43.260 --> 01:08:44.260]   No, I just want more.
[01:08:44.260 --> 01:08:47.260]   John was complaining because we had bready sandwiches.
[01:08:47.260 --> 01:08:48.260]   And so we got Indian food.
[01:08:48.260 --> 01:08:49.260]   He feed us.
[01:08:49.260 --> 01:08:51.260]   John got all excited about my coffee though.
[01:08:51.260 --> 01:08:53.980]   Oh, he brought one of these new aud--
[01:08:53.980 --> 01:08:56.540]   There's a cup you can buy a safe way or something
[01:08:56.540 --> 01:08:58.260]   whether you store a good store.
[01:08:58.260 --> 01:09:01.500]   And you squeeze it and it heats up and it makes you a hot cup of coffee.
[01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:02.500]   What's that cost?
[01:09:02.500 --> 01:09:03.500]   What's that cost?
[01:09:03.500 --> 01:09:04.500]   $2.69.
[01:09:04.500 --> 01:09:05.500]   Unbelievable.
[01:09:05.500 --> 01:09:06.500]   Wolfgang Puck.
[01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:07.500]   That's what is a Wolfgang Puck thing.
[01:09:07.500 --> 01:09:08.500]   You can push the button on me.
[01:09:08.500 --> 01:09:09.500]   You got it.
[01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:10.500]   And I'm not going to--
[01:09:10.500 --> 01:09:11.500]   And I'm not going to--
[01:09:11.500 --> 01:09:12.500]   And I'm not going to--
[01:09:12.500 --> 01:09:13.500]   I want to see the Nokia thing.
[01:09:13.500 --> 01:09:14.500]   Unbelievable.
[01:09:14.500 --> 01:09:15.500]   He's got this new--
[01:09:15.500 --> 01:09:16.500]   Don't be bad.
[01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:17.500]   No, we can edit it.
[01:09:17.500 --> 01:09:18.500]   We get--
[01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:19.500]   So you buy this and you squeeze it and it heats up--
[01:09:19.500 --> 01:09:20.500]   Don't spill that on your computer.
[01:09:20.500 --> 01:09:21.500]   It's Wolfgang Puck.
[01:09:21.500 --> 01:09:22.500]   Can I see the button on your computer?
[01:09:22.500 --> 01:09:23.500]   Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[01:09:23.500 --> 01:09:24.500]   It's just like Wolfgang.
[01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:31.500]   And on the bottom too.
[01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:32.500]   Hot.
[01:09:32.500 --> 01:09:33.500]   Does it work?
[01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:34.500]   Does it work like those instant hot packs?
[01:09:34.500 --> 01:09:35.500]   This is nice.
[01:09:35.500 --> 01:09:36.500]   Or you break in the great chemicals and make something good.
[01:09:36.500 --> 01:09:39.500]   Yeah, so it's one use only.
[01:09:39.500 --> 01:09:40.500]   It's one use only.
[01:09:40.500 --> 01:09:44.180]   And what I find kind of striking about this is in third world countries they don't have
[01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:45.180]   refrigeration.
[01:09:45.180 --> 01:09:47.180]   And here we have coffee in a can.
[01:09:47.180 --> 01:09:48.180]   You flip it over.
[01:09:48.180 --> 01:09:49.180]   You push a button five minutes later.
[01:09:49.180 --> 01:09:50.740]   You've got a coffee at 148 degrees.
[01:09:50.740 --> 01:09:52.220]   Now it tastes great.
[01:09:52.220 --> 01:09:53.220]   The neck--
[01:09:53.220 --> 01:09:54.220]   What about a cooling one?
[01:09:54.220 --> 01:09:56.220]   You push the button and it turns the dog.
[01:09:56.220 --> 01:09:57.220]   How does it know?
[01:09:57.220 --> 01:09:58.220]   See, that's a lot more difficult.
[01:09:58.220 --> 01:09:59.220]   It's a third reaction.
[01:09:59.220 --> 01:10:00.220]   No, you know what?
[01:10:00.220 --> 01:10:01.220]   That's a chemical reaction.
[01:10:01.220 --> 01:10:03.620]   We've got the room heated to 72.
[01:10:03.620 --> 01:10:08.220]   Inside the 72 degree room we've got a refrigerator that keeps our coffee cool at 32 degrees so
[01:10:08.220 --> 01:10:11.620]   that we can take the can out of the refrigerator, press a button and heat it to 148 degrees.
[01:10:11.620 --> 01:10:12.620]   Now that's technology.
[01:10:12.620 --> 01:10:13.620]   OK, here's--
[01:10:13.620 --> 01:10:14.620]   Now this is very cool.
[01:10:14.620 --> 01:10:17.620]   This is Nokia's-- is this the i70?
[01:10:17.620 --> 01:10:19.420]   What did they call this?
[01:10:19.420 --> 01:10:20.420]   I don't know what they call this.
[01:10:20.420 --> 01:10:21.420]   It's an internet tablet.
[01:10:21.420 --> 01:10:22.420]   Yeah.
[01:10:22.420 --> 01:10:24.620]   But it's smaller than your typical tablet.
[01:10:24.620 --> 01:10:25.620]   Yeah.
[01:10:25.620 --> 01:10:27.420]   Is it-- what's it running a OS?
[01:10:27.420 --> 01:10:28.420]   It runs Linux.
[01:10:28.420 --> 01:10:29.420]   It runs Linux.
[01:10:29.420 --> 01:10:30.420]   It runs Linux.
[01:10:30.420 --> 01:10:35.820]   It does Wi-Fi and it'll also sync up with your Bluetooth phone so that it will use your
[01:10:35.820 --> 01:10:36.820]   phone.
[01:10:36.820 --> 01:10:37.820]   So this is not a phone at all?
[01:10:37.820 --> 01:10:38.820]   No, it's not a phone.
[01:10:38.820 --> 01:10:39.820]   It's from Nokia though.
[01:10:39.820 --> 01:10:40.820]   It's the web browser.
[01:10:40.820 --> 01:10:44.420]   But you could pair it up with your cell phone that supports, you know, EVDO or GSM.
[01:10:44.420 --> 01:10:45.420]   So it's a committee tab.
[01:10:45.420 --> 01:10:47.620]   And that's what they want you to do.
[01:10:47.620 --> 01:10:52.340]   You know, it's kind of funny because we browse the web on our little blackberries and
[01:10:52.340 --> 01:10:53.340]   whatnot.
[01:10:53.340 --> 01:10:54.340]   Sorry.
[01:10:54.340 --> 01:10:55.340]   And it's just one to look at it.
[01:10:55.340 --> 01:10:56.340]   All right.
[01:10:56.340 --> 01:10:57.340]   But aside from that, it's pretty similar.
[01:10:57.340 --> 01:10:58.340]   What's the--
[01:10:58.340 --> 01:10:59.340]   Oh, here's what it's supposed to be.
[01:10:59.340 --> 01:11:00.340]   Oh, no, go ahead.
[01:11:00.340 --> 01:11:01.340]   No, that's OK.
[01:11:01.340 --> 01:11:02.340]   I don't have--
[01:11:02.340 --> 01:11:03.340]   Yeah, I'm not sure.
[01:11:03.340 --> 01:11:04.340]   So you like it?
[01:11:04.340 --> 01:11:05.340]   Well, I just got it today.
[01:11:05.340 --> 01:11:06.340]   It's $4 or $500.
[01:11:06.340 --> 01:11:07.340]   $3.50?
[01:11:07.340 --> 01:11:08.340]   Can you watch Flash animations?
[01:11:08.340 --> 01:11:09.340]   I have no idea.
[01:11:09.340 --> 01:11:11.340]   You know, it just showed up about three hours ago.
[01:11:11.340 --> 01:11:12.340]   I do that.
[01:11:12.340 --> 01:11:14.340]   Yeah, UPS showed up today.
[01:11:14.340 --> 01:11:15.340]   You bought it.
[01:11:15.340 --> 01:11:16.340]   This is brand new.
[01:11:16.340 --> 01:11:17.340]   They just started shipping these things.
[01:11:17.340 --> 01:11:20.620]   And I wanted to try it because we've got these Wi-Fi initiatives and we're talking about
[01:11:20.620 --> 01:11:21.620]   Wi-Fi coverage.
[01:11:21.620 --> 01:11:23.620]   And it's got a little speaker to use.
[01:11:23.620 --> 01:11:24.620]   Yeah.
[01:11:24.620 --> 01:11:28.460]   And the trouble is, I'm not carrying my laptop around when I'm in these downtown areas where
[01:11:28.460 --> 01:11:30.460]   we're deploying wireless networks.
[01:11:30.460 --> 01:11:32.540]   And I want to know what's working and what isn't.
[01:11:32.540 --> 01:11:34.540]   And so this seemed like a good way to test the Wi-Fi.
[01:11:34.540 --> 01:11:36.260]   What happens if you drop it?
[01:11:36.260 --> 01:11:37.260]   John.
[01:11:37.260 --> 01:11:38.260]   It's a good question.
[01:11:38.260 --> 01:11:40.740]   He's worked a little too long in the ZD labs.
[01:11:40.740 --> 01:11:41.740]   You can drop this.
[01:11:41.740 --> 01:11:42.740]   This is actually concrete.
[01:11:42.740 --> 01:11:43.740]   That's amazing.
[01:11:43.740 --> 01:11:44.740]   It is.
[01:11:44.740 --> 01:11:45.740]   Well, the thing that--
[01:11:45.740 --> 01:11:49.540]   Yeah, because the thing that activates it is quick-line, which is what makes--
[01:11:49.540 --> 01:11:50.540]   So now it's--
[01:11:50.540 --> 01:11:51.540]   It's not concrete yet.
[01:11:51.540 --> 01:11:52.540]   It's hot.
[01:11:52.540 --> 01:11:53.540]   Who knows?
[01:11:53.540 --> 01:11:54.540]   I mean, you're not supposed to open it up.
[01:11:54.540 --> 01:11:57.460]   But in the bottom, there's a nightmare for the refuse companies.
[01:11:57.460 --> 01:11:59.900]   This is exactly what's wrong with America right now.
[01:11:59.900 --> 01:12:00.900]   Look at that.
[01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:01.900]   Talk about waste landing.
[01:12:01.900 --> 01:12:02.900]   Oh, totally.
[01:12:02.900 --> 01:12:03.900]   Moly.
[01:12:03.900 --> 01:12:04.900]   Sure.
[01:12:04.900 --> 01:12:05.900]   It's got glassy.
[01:12:05.900 --> 01:12:06.900]   It's got one deal you'll need to terminate, I think.
[01:12:06.900 --> 01:12:07.900]   Oh, you're right.
[01:12:07.900 --> 01:12:08.900]   You're right.
[01:12:08.900 --> 01:12:09.900]   One time you use cup of coffee.
[01:12:09.900 --> 01:12:10.900]   It's got a nightmare.
[01:12:10.900 --> 01:12:11.900]   So there's nothing in it now.
[01:12:11.900 --> 01:12:12.900]   If it's concrete, careful.
[01:12:12.900 --> 01:12:13.900]   Man.
[01:12:13.900 --> 01:12:18.180]   It's just shred the outside and take it off.
[01:12:18.180 --> 01:12:21.780]   If Wolfgang, if you want to advertise on this show, we'll take it off.
[01:12:21.780 --> 01:12:23.860]   Can we take a bunch of these and build like overpass?
[01:12:23.860 --> 01:12:27.260]   Actually, in fact, we talked about we should have a few cases of these coming in.
[01:12:27.260 --> 01:12:28.260]   Well, we'll take it.
[01:12:28.260 --> 01:12:30.580]   You think about how much concrete we use in this society.
[01:12:30.580 --> 01:12:31.580]   You know what?
[01:12:31.580 --> 01:12:32.580]   We're landing over everything.
[01:12:32.580 --> 01:12:35.420]   You say there's really concrete in here.
[01:12:35.420 --> 01:12:36.580]   This is the next building material.
[01:12:36.580 --> 01:12:38.780]   It's not concrete per se, but quick-line, which is--
[01:12:38.780 --> 01:12:40.020]   I think you might be right.
[01:12:40.020 --> 01:12:41.020]   Yeah, be great.
[01:12:41.020 --> 01:12:42.020]   You can make a can house.
[01:12:42.020 --> 01:12:43.020]   Archaeologists are going to find these.
[01:12:43.020 --> 01:12:44.020]   Howard by OnTech.
[01:12:44.020 --> 01:12:46.020]   And is this the first time it's been used on the--
[01:12:46.020 --> 01:12:48.020]   On the Twitch show, yes.
[01:12:48.020 --> 01:12:49.020]   I've never heard of it.
[01:12:49.020 --> 01:12:51.300]   Well, they use something similar.
[01:12:51.300 --> 01:12:53.300]   But it's more like the hot packs where they--
[01:12:53.300 --> 01:12:55.300]   They have to say do not micro-register.
[01:12:55.300 --> 01:12:56.300]   They just need to knit with it.
[01:12:56.300 --> 01:12:57.300]   You can just say, oh, no.
[01:12:57.300 --> 01:12:58.300]   Heated.
[01:12:58.300 --> 01:12:59.300]   I'm not sure if it's the same.
[01:12:59.300 --> 01:13:00.300]   I'm not sure if it's the same.
[01:13:00.300 --> 01:13:02.300]   We're sure you have the can, but maybe it's the same thing.
[01:13:02.300 --> 01:13:03.300]   So it was pretty hot.
[01:13:03.300 --> 01:13:04.300]   Oh, yeah.
[01:13:04.300 --> 01:13:05.300]   It was.
[01:13:05.300 --> 01:13:06.300]   It was very hot.
[01:13:06.300 --> 01:13:08.340]   And actually, the nice thing about this is you sleep in, you're in a rush, you're leaving
[01:13:08.340 --> 01:13:11.260]   the house, you have these in your glove box in your car.
[01:13:11.260 --> 01:13:13.060]   They keep forever.
[01:13:13.060 --> 01:13:14.060]   It's a little decadent.
[01:13:14.060 --> 01:13:15.980]   Truly, we live in a garden of Eden.
[01:13:15.980 --> 01:13:16.980]   If we do.
[01:13:16.980 --> 01:13:18.980]   A garden of coffee.
[01:13:18.980 --> 01:13:19.980]   So--
[01:13:19.980 --> 01:13:21.780]   Hey, we're a coffee society.
[01:13:21.780 --> 01:13:23.260]   Look how much Starbucks is worth.
[01:13:23.260 --> 01:13:27.100]   So I can get the TV dinner that automatically cooks when I peel it open.
[01:13:27.100 --> 01:13:28.100]   I'm sure you can.
[01:13:28.100 --> 01:13:31.700]   I'm sure they're going to come out with, you know, chili and soup and who the heck?
[01:13:31.700 --> 01:13:32.700]   MRE is crazy.
[01:13:32.700 --> 01:13:34.500]   Hey, we have to run.
[01:13:34.500 --> 01:13:39.340]   We want to thank our friends at AOL and the AOL podcasting channel on AOLMusic.com
[01:13:39.340 --> 01:13:43.300]   for providing the bandwidth for this show and, of course, for airing this week in tech.
[01:13:43.300 --> 01:13:44.300]   We really appreciate that.
[01:13:44.300 --> 01:13:47.100]   And, of course, Bob Heil for our beautiful mics.
[01:13:47.100 --> 01:13:49.140]   I love my microphone.
[01:13:49.140 --> 01:13:50.140]   You like your microphone?
[01:13:50.140 --> 01:13:52.340]   I still like to get one for the Skype.
[01:13:52.340 --> 01:13:53.820]   Oh, we got to get one for you.
[01:13:53.820 --> 01:13:54.820]   And the UVM audio.
[01:13:54.820 --> 01:13:56.620]   I talked about that.
[01:13:56.620 --> 01:13:58.060]   I really want to thank our special guest.
[01:13:58.060 --> 01:13:59.060]   It's been a lot of fun.
[01:13:59.060 --> 01:14:00.060]   Yeah, it was good show.
[01:14:00.060 --> 01:14:01.060]   Yeah, it was great.
[01:14:01.060 --> 01:14:02.060]   Dane Jasper from Sonic.net.
[01:14:02.060 --> 01:14:03.060]   Thank you.
[01:14:03.060 --> 01:14:05.340]   A great internet service provider.
[01:14:05.340 --> 01:14:09.300]   And for using for years, I still am still a subscriber.
[01:14:09.300 --> 01:14:11.860]   And I owe you $30,000.
[01:14:11.860 --> 01:14:12.860]   David Prager.
[01:14:12.860 --> 01:14:13.860]   Wow.
[01:14:13.860 --> 01:14:15.580]   David Prager from Revision 3.
[01:14:15.580 --> 01:14:17.460]   Got a new system coming out soon.
[01:14:17.460 --> 01:14:18.460]   Yep.
[01:14:18.460 --> 01:14:19.460]   A lot of new stuff.
[01:14:19.460 --> 01:14:20.460]   Oh, gosh.
[01:14:20.460 --> 01:14:21.460]   A lot of new stuff.
[01:14:21.460 --> 01:14:22.780]   That's my alkaline water.
[01:14:22.780 --> 01:14:24.940]   John C. Devorectevorectevorect.org/blog.
[01:14:24.940 --> 01:14:28.340]   We give it a little thing.
[01:14:28.340 --> 01:14:29.340]   That's not digitalization.
[01:14:29.340 --> 01:14:34.060]   Also, Mark at Watch Had a Good Column this week on Google and also PCMag.com.
[01:14:34.060 --> 01:14:35.860]   And I really want to thank Greg Zachary for coming.
[01:14:35.860 --> 01:14:36.860]   Please come back.
[01:14:36.860 --> 01:14:37.860]   You are.
[01:14:37.860 --> 01:14:38.860]   Really great to have you.
[01:14:38.860 --> 01:14:39.860]   Business 2.0.
[01:14:39.860 --> 01:14:40.860]   That's where we can find your stuff.
[01:14:40.860 --> 01:14:43.340]   What's the most recent book?
[01:14:43.340 --> 01:14:47.140]   It's called the Diversity Advantage, Multicultural Identity in the New World Economy.
[01:14:47.140 --> 01:14:49.700]   And I've been writing a lot for the San Francisco Chronicle as well.
[01:14:49.700 --> 01:14:50.700]   Right.
[01:14:50.700 --> 01:14:52.100]   All about mongrels.
[01:14:52.100 --> 01:14:53.940]   Speaking of mongrels, we want to thank Roger Chang.
[01:14:53.940 --> 01:14:54.940]   Jeez, thanks.
[01:14:54.940 --> 01:14:55.940]   How do it work?
[01:14:55.940 --> 01:14:56.940]   As a known.
[01:14:56.940 --> 01:14:57.940]   Out of luck.
[01:14:57.940 --> 01:14:58.940]   Out of time.
[01:14:58.940 --> 01:15:02.580]   Another Twit is in the can.

[01:15:28.820 --> 01:15:33.100]   This is Twit, This Week in Tech, Episode 39.
[01:15:33.100 --> 01:15:34.100]   For January 20th.
[01:15:34.100 --> 01:15:35.100]   No, January 22nd, 2006.
[01:15:35.100 --> 01:15:36.100]   That's a 2005.
[01:15:36.100 --> 01:15:37.100]   Hello.
[01:15:37.100 --> 01:15:38.100]   I'm speaking down the barrel.
[01:15:38.100 --> 01:15:45.100]   Welcome to WKRP Cincinnati.
[01:15:45.100 --> 01:15:49.100]   No, no, no.
[01:15:49.100 --> 01:15:50.100]   Cock dreingly.
[01:15:50.100 --> 01:15:51.100]   Very directional.
[01:15:51.100 --> 01:15:52.100]   Very directional.
[01:15:52.100 --> 01:15:55.100]   Oh, and there's a cock button.
[01:15:55.100 --> 01:15:56.100]   Ah, ah.
[01:15:56.100 --> 01:15:59.100]   Does this one work?
[01:15:59.100 --> 01:16:00.100]   No.
[01:16:00.100 --> 01:16:03.100]   You guys having a good time?
[01:16:03.100 --> 01:16:05.100]   Were you doing this show?
[01:16:05.100 --> 01:16:07.100]   Yes, we're doing it right now.
[01:16:07.100 --> 01:16:08.100]   Ready?
[01:16:08.100 --> 01:16:14.100]   This is Twit, This Week in Tech, Episode 39.
[01:16:14.100 --> 01:16:15.100]   Wow.
[01:16:15.100 --> 01:16:18.100]   I've never been cut before.
[01:16:18.100 --> 01:16:21.100]   This is a fun show.
[01:16:21.100 --> 01:16:23.100]   This is a fun show.
[01:16:23.100 --> 01:16:28.100]   I'm going to cut every other show.
[01:16:28.100 --> 01:16:33.100]   I'm drinking alkaline water, baby.
[01:16:33.100 --> 01:16:35.100]   It's a pH 10.
[01:16:35.100 --> 01:16:37.100]   It's a great Kurzweil, baby.
[01:16:37.100 --> 01:16:39.100]   I'm going to live.
[01:16:39.100 --> 01:16:42.100]   I'm going to live forever.
[01:16:42.100 --> 01:16:46.100]   This is a crack of a dreingly.
[01:16:46.100 --> 01:16:49.100]   This is a crack of a dreingly.
[01:16:49.100 --> 01:16:54.100]   This is a crack of a dreingly.
