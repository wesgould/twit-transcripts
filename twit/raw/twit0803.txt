[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.400]   We decided to give all of our hosts the week off for the holidays
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:39.520]   By making our editors and producers and staff work twice as hard to put together this best of
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.840]   Episode I'm sorry guys. Thank you to Carsten Bonnie and Jason Howell
[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:52.880]   Thanks to our editors John and Kevin and Victor. Thanks to our executive producer my own dear wife Lisa
[00:01:53.440 --> 00:02:01.880]   And of course Jerry wagley our supervising producer and Anthony Nielsen who is a hard working guy in charge of all of our productions
[00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.240]   He is he is a great creative
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:11.760]   They've all worked very hard including the back office staff Debbie and Sarah and Ashley and our accounting staff
[00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.400]   Penny and Robin
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.660]   Have I left people out? No, yeah, I left the most important people out our studio team
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:28.960]   The great John Slumina Janner Jammer be and Burke McQuinn. Thank you John and Burke for keeping the the tape rolling and of course Russell Tammany
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.600]   R. I t guy. He's he's not an employee
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.680]   He's a he's a contractor works for a lot of other companies
[00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:41.480]   But boy Russell's love for twit and the streaming that we do has helped us stay on the year
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.480]   I hope I haven't left anybody out, but
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:50.280]   Every one of you is a crucial part of what happens of what goes on a twit. I did I left out Masako
[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:57.320]   In our marketing department. I'm going down. I haven't seen you all in so long 2020. It's been a very strange year
[00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:02.200]   Everybody's been working from home. I'm the only guy coming into the studio
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.920]   All of our other hosts mica sergeant Jason Howell
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.880]   Anthony Pruitt they're all staying home to stay safe as I hope you are as well
[00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.960]   But we've managed to still put together
[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:19.680]   I think a pretty good run of shows for 2020 and our big show this week in tech
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.800]   Is no exception. Let's start at the very beginning of the year before we even knew
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:30.640]   What was coming in 2020 a wrap up from what may well be the last?
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.960]   tech convention ever CES
[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:39.760]   CES was all last week. None of us are sick. This is an unheard-up proposition
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.960]   Hey, this is this time the incubation period. We're still within it. Oh, we still will still happen
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:49.640]   So technically could be carriers. That's fair. I haven't been in eight years
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.680]   And I one of the reasons I didn't go for so long
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.960]   Part partly is it's just a nightmare in fact a lot of you know last week
[00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:03.040]   I asked my panel how many of you're going to see as a none of them are going because they're all
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:09.680]   Senior enough in tech journalists. They don't have to go right nobody imposes on themselves like we did and right?
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.280]   That's nuts or like you guys do all of you could have recused yourselves
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.840]   There's something fun about it though. I liken it
[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:22.000]   To a football game if you go to an NFL game
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.240]   You go for the atmosphere for the fun not to see the game you could see it much better at home on your TV
[00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:34.520]   Then you can and you know even if you have good seats because it's distant and it's people running around and it's and see yes
[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:42.000]   Is like that you can only get it's like the the elephant and the blind men you can only get it's four thousand five hundred booths
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.320]   That means you know more than you know twelve thousand products. It's you only have so much time
[00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:52.560]   It's impossible in four days to even scratch the surface right so you know
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.760]   You'd be better off if you care about CES to let everybody else go read all the coverage
[00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:03.000]   But if you want to get the so once in a while, I think it's fun to go get the atmosphere all of you go all the time
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   Right I go for the swag yeah
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.400]   He's just you brought some I'm pretty good at getting you know
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.960]   When I when I first started going I could remember
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:17.560]   Prior to actually being able to go hearing folks like yourself and other senior
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.160]   Oh, I could never go I don't want to go back
[00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:29.760]   It's not like really but after going to two times or so I could see why you would feel that way because it is a grind
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:33.840]   I mean you are oh yeah, you are running around it's hard to get around shoes
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.560]   And if you're covering it if you're work
[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:39.480]   It's easier if you're not working it right if you just didn't wear just hanging out and that's actually fun
[00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:43.860]   Right, but if you're working you feel an onus to guy see as much as possible right?
[00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:47.720]   I think I went to north central and south halls. I went to the Sands Expo Center
[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.040]   I went to the Venetian
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.440]   Hmm
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.740]   I mean and I and I still didn't get to Mandalay Bay and I still missed thousands of products
[00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:56.080]   I wanted to see right Jason. How do you do it?
[00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.880]   Well, we have 90 people
[00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:08.040]   We cut it up into little chunks and we you know we try to get down every aisle of every
[00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:10.760]   you know every
[00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:18.000]   Exhibit by beat do you say okay Lexi you're gonna cover health tech and stuff like that
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.280]   Yeah, yeah, we do it's by and large
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:24.720]   But but then we still even have to slice and dice it right because there's some that have overlapping beats
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:28.160]   There's some things there that is in nobody's beat and so
[00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:32.360]   We have to really be strategic
[00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:41.080]   Culture team so it's actually true. It's culture. We have a culture team
[00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.480]   And then we also have a team that's focused on health and wellness
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:47.400]   This was a big story partly because it has the word sex in it
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:52.760]   But this is a big story because last year the Consumer Electronics Association, which runs CES
[00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:58.100]   inadvertently gave an award to a vibrator then yanked it
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:11.200]   Thank you and and got a lot of heat in fact the company that created that and won the award and then lost the award
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:15.200]   Was smart and went out did I press releases went on a tour?
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:19.360]   They got more coverage and they would have otherwise and I think the CEA said oops
[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:22.920]   That was a mistake because we've allowed you know these to have adult
[00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:29.480]   Corner where they'd have adult videotapes in there right eventually they had X X dial that across the hall
[00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:35.160]   But it was very sexist that they said well you can't have women's health products, but you can have men's
[00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:40.480]   Exactly right. I don't know if health they just tried to treat it like adults this year. I think that's I think that was better now
[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:42.480]   Of course, I'm the one is not
[00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:44.920]   such a scenic it so
[00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:51.640]   There were ten I have to say there were a lot of them and I avoided it. I didn't want to cover it I
[00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:58.440]   Didn't want to like I didn't even know how I personally didn't have any interest in it, but that's just me
[00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:04.400]   I I went to a suite that had a bunch of products and I came
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.720]   Did you wear your collar? I was wearing my car?
[00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:12.600]   With a gift bag and I didn't open it up to like I got back to my house and there were two of them in there
[00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:18.640]   I'm like oh, I am I gonna explain that when I get back to the Vatican? It's kind of embarrassing and I don't want to I
[00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:23.400]   Don't want to be sexist about it. It is ridiculous that women's health and women's pleasure was
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:29.820]   Somehow second-class to men's pleasure, right? So I'm glad that they did the right thing, but at the same time
[00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:32.880]   Do you have any computers?
[00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:38.440]   Is there anything else I can I can I'll only say two things one a
[00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:45.240]   Well-designed product actually is amazing because it's not just a product you have to design it for comfort
[00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:47.240]   You have to design it with proper materials
[00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:52.560]   the second thing is and they're bluetooth and Wi-Fi and in many cases that I do not like because
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:56.200]   They again, and this is not just for health
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:09:02.760]   Technology, but this is for any technology when security gets slapped on as an afterthought you are just asking for trouble
[00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:07.440]   Yeah, but they they don't know that and there are indeed just exactly they're not even considering
[00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:13.160]   All right, you know, but but you've got these internet enabled applications and I'm like do you really want that?
[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:18.760]   Yeah, I mean unless you've actually considered how that can be abused that should not be a feature. Yeah
[00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:21.960]   Well said
[00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:23.960]   Anyway, I
[00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:27.120]   So good you know, so if you want coverage don't come to Twitter for that
[00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:30.000]   You go to see that they had a whole section
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:36.860]   Apple's new privacy features have further rattled the location based ad market
[00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:41.020]   This is one for the good guys, you know that pop up you get an iOS 13
[00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:44.000]   You get it on Android now too when it says hey, you know
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:50.800]   Google has just you know check your location four times in the last 24 hours
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:56.940]   You know that pop up and it says do you want to allow that or maybe only when the apps open or maybe not at all
[00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:02.120]   So that's been going on since iOS 13 was released in September
[00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:05.080]   ad tech sources are
[00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:08.280]   Saying it has been a big hit
[00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:11.520]   To the amount of data they can gather
[00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:18.840]   Digitake quotes Benoit Grouchko who has a great name by the way been that Benoit Grouchko
[00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:24.280]   He runs the ad tech business Timo they do software for apps to collect that location data
[00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:29.800]   He says three years ago opt-in rates almost a hundred percent almost everybody left location on
[00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:35.280]   Ever since iOS 13 the opt-in rate now is often below 50 percent
[00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:40.480]   People when they're given the choice saying you know what no
[00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:50.840]   7 in 10 iOS 13 location signals analyzed by location sciences in the six weeks after iOS 13 came out
[00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:55.880]   80% of those users stopped all back where I'm tracking across their devices
[00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:59.760]   so if if you're in the business of
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:03.680]   selling based on location
[00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:08.920]   Publiccy agency star comms said this impacts the ability to tie users
[00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:13.720]   That research online and purchase in store or driving a measure foot-fault for clients
[00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:20.200]   This is some Google offers by the way Google monitors credit card purchases and then says to an advertiser
[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:27.240]   Hey, this guy saw your ad on Tuesday and went to the store and bought your product on Wednesday your ads working
[00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:30.120]   Not as easy
[00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:32.760]   Not as easy
[00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:39.280]   Time to celebrate Georgia you you have your iPhone user I am I love it
[00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:44.840]   I'm what do you do when you see that pop-up? I'll always opt out. I'm actually shocked that there's 50%
[00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:51.540]   Allow it. What are you doing? Stop it. It's creepy. Would you want someone walking around?
[00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:57.520]   Tracking you if you could see them, you know snooping into your bathroom looking at what you're doing what you're surfing around
[00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:59.840]   You'd say stop doing that you'd close your blinds
[00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:05.460]   There's a few of you that you'd be like yay into that most people would say no stop following me around
[00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:11.920]   Actually, you know what I'm weird Georgia. Are you I always say I always allow in fact
[00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:16.760]   Do you why it pisses me off because Apple doesn't usually give always allow as an option
[00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:21.520]   There's really most of the time I see two options allow when app is in use don't allow
[00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:26.700]   You have to go into the settings to turn on always allow and I do because I want them to know
[00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:29.280]   What do you want them to know I?
[00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:32.040]   everything
[00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:35.000]   I like it Patrick knows I feel like they care
[00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:42.040]   Do you think that you get better targeted at yes, what's wrong with that? I think I get better ads
[00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:46.880]   I walked by the Levi store and it says hey, here's a coupon you can go in
[00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:53.480]   My Google Maps. I love that feature where I can look at my timeline and see all the places I've been
[00:12:53.480 --> 00:13:00.480]   Why wouldn't I want that who what do they what do you think they're following me around is it like somebody?
[00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:05.000]   It is like following you around the best part of this conversation
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:11.240]   Is like two minutes ago. It was like I don't want law enforcement to be able to track us everywhere
[00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:16.000]   And the reality is through third-party marketing tools if they can identify your phone
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:23.920]   Which is not that hard to do the level of mapping and tracking they can do now without using any official tools is?
[00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:26.200]   Kind of terrifying
[00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:32.280]   So you're saying I see I don't worry about Google you're saying but you should realize that Google might be given that information to the cops
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:38.880]   Or or it's actually turned out a lot of a lot of apps sell the tracking information to third-party services
[00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:45.920]   Which are then you know people can walk up with a you know credit card number and get information that you would freak out if it was made available
[00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:48.280]   directly from you know
[00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:50.280]   from from Google or from Apple
[00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:54.920]   Yeah, or for example the cars to the automation the cars track is
[00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:57.400]   utterly terrifying at this point like
[00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:03.440]   You know I may never buy a new car again based on the amount of information that's being pulled out of the oh man
[00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:04.440]   I drove a Tesla
[00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:08.400]   I would call Tesla and say you know I think this I this happened
[00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:13.760]   You know I had it in forward and your car went backward and they say well no wait a minute
[00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:14.880]   What time did that happen?
[00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:19.280]   Well this afternoon and look no no you were going you had you had it in forward
[00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:20.800]   I had I can see the log
[00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:23.720]   No, this is sensor registered it is forward not
[00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:27.560]   That's what I should have said it's your sensors fall
[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:31.000]   Patrick when it depends on the amount of torque though
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:39.040]   Well if it accidentally goes into reverse and and and you bump into it, you know with your
[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:42.360]   I'm gonna pick on Prius because it's here
[00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:43.280]   No, no
[00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:50.280]   Why don't mind if Elon knows and I don't mind if Google knows Google's not handing my information over to law enforcement in
[00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:52.920]   unprecedented geo-fence
[00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:59.960]   It's all those other apps what you know, you know, I've got you know, I've got
[00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:03.560]   Android 10 on my pixel 3 now and
[00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:10.360]   You know they added the same thing in there so that now in all the apps you can go in and set your location preferences by app
[00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:16.200]   You know to always allow you know allow when in use or never allow and I was shocked
[00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:23.280]   You know after upgrading to 10 you know some of these apps that were coming up and asking you know for location permission
[00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:28.000]   That they hadn't I mean, you know games and stuff that had no business knowing where I was
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:34.800]   I don't mind, you know Google Maps, you know having my location. I mean that's why I was not using it. Yeah, you know
[00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:37.680]   And you know things things like you know lift or uber
[00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:40.720]   Clearly they need to know where I am when I'm using them
[00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:45.800]   But there is no reason for a ride hailing app to know where I am when I'm not using the app
[00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:49.120]   Yeah, any time that I'm not using the app it's off
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:54.160]   And I think the only app I have set to always allow is Google Maps because like you Leo
[00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:57.320]   I like I do like the timeline. It's I find it useful
[00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:01.280]   Plus I want to help learn enforcement when there's a robbery
[00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:04.560]   Yeah, they want everybody who was in 500 feet of the robbery
[00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:11.880]   A gold jacket and a gold heart is at this location. Look at your cameras. You can't miss me
[00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:17.760]   Transparency though, it's that you don't really know
[00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:22.000]   what they're gonna be doing with it and who they're gonna be selling it to and
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:28.320]   What they're gonna be using it for there are no regulations to make sure that they're really being honest and it's legible
[00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:31.320]   No one reads the privacy like I have every once in a while
[00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:34.280]   It's terrifying and then I always don't you know if I really want the app
[00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:38.560]   I won't read it because then I will say no, but no one reads it. It's illegible. So
[00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:42.720]   It's a big problem actually I'll be honest. I almost always
[00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:47.120]   Click select only when using app because that seems reasonable to me
[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:50.600]   And if it's an app that shouldn't have location information if it's for tonight or something
[00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:51.920]   I say no
[00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:59.280]   You remember the flashlight app that some nefarious company bought and then it was basically it went from being like you can turn on the light
[00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:04.920]   For your camera when you're not actually using your camera and then they did an update and it was looking for information
[00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:09.680]   It was basically accessing all possible information on your phone your photos your contact information
[00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:16.880]   Everything it was it was kind of fascinating to watch because you know the the millions of downloads
[00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:22.720]   This was before they integrated this stuff into the operating system people kept downloading it installing it presumably saying okay
[00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:30.960]   That's how badly they wanted a flashlight at but there's a there's an article the New York Times did back in the middle of December 12 million phones one data set zero privacy
[00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:33.520]   where
[00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:36.080]   somebody turned over a
[00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:45.920]   Data set which was 50 billion pings quote 50 billion pings from the phones of more than 12 million Americans as they moved through several major cities
[00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:48.840]   including Washington, New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles
[00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:51.040]   and
[00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:57.040]   You know basically because apps that that would track you and then report the information
[00:17:57.040 --> 00:18:00.160]   You know it also meant that these
[00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:03.960]   unregulated, you know third-party app data collection
[00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:13.160]   Centers could allow any way with that information to you know track the location of you know people who probably shouldn't be tracked or don't want to be tracked
[00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:20.680]   whether they are celebrities or you know X's or you know abused enemy it's it's it's kind of
[00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:26.160]   Amazing how much information is out there and just it's
[00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:30.880]   You know the William Gittson lines my favorite the street finds its own uses for things
[00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:35.280]   You know the streets kind of find its own use for this information and it might be creepy as hell
[00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:43.200]   That's actually a really important point is that you can invent a technology and have an idea about how it's going to be used law
[00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:45.000]   Enforcement can have an idea
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   But you know well with kesgro will only you will only use the ring of power if for good not evil
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:57.200]   But the street finds its own uses is a really good thing to keep in mind. I like that Patrick. Yeah
[00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:04.120]   Thank William Gittson. Yeah, it just that's the nature of technology. It flows like water
[00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:09.520]   This year the iPad celebrated its 10th anniversary
[00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:14.200]   We're gonna take a look back to the iPad 10 years ago in just a minute, but before we do
[00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:16.840]   I'd like to thank our sponsor
[00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:24.120]   It's very nice to have sponsors on our best of shows and zen desk is a great sponsor customer service is
[00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:27.840]   I'm something I really believe in I think a good company

[00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:41.240]   Calling your bank or using an app to get a ride to an airport. I think you know
[00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:44.600]   Which companies do it right and which companies don't?
[00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:51.920]   Sometimes even great teams can struggle to make their customers feel taken care of that's why zen desk is so great
[00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:55.400]   They're award-winning support sales and customer engagement software

[00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:06.680]   So your team can create conversational experiences that keep customers happy and you know
[00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:10.960]   Customers are very quick if something goes wrong on a phone call to a bank
[00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:17.760]   Who hasn't had a frustrating experience calling a company that word goes out people tweet about it
[00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:24.120]   They tell their friends on the other hand and I want to encourage everybody to do this when you have a great customer experience
[00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:26.640]   You remember it don't you and you go back?
[00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:31.800]   I try only to deal with companies that give me that feeling that they care about
[00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:34.880]   Me as a customer a great customer experience
[00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:40.560]   It's so important and I'm betting most of the companies that I really like are using zen desk
[00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:47.960]   You can communicate seamlessly across every channel email phone chat messenger community forums help centers social media
[00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:52.480]   Zenisk uses a term. I think it's a really good one called they call it a conversational
[00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:54.600]   experience
[00:20:54.600 --> 00:21:00.840]   What makes a conversational what's connected? It's ongoing, but most importantly it's genuine. It's a natural
[00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:05.880]   Customer interaction and if you can create that feeling that it's a one-to-one experience
[00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:15.160]   You're have a customer for life. That's what zen desk enables with a complete customer profile a unified set of tools that give you the context
[00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:19.960]   You need to deliver great service in every conversation now most software
[00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:23.040]   Support software requires expensive consultants
[00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:28.400]   Months have set up not zen desk. It just takes hours for you to get it up and running
[00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:34.480]   It's easy to implement. It's fast and and even so they scale
[00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:41.760]   To meet changing needs, you know when you're a small business good customer service isn't so hard as you get bigger
[00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:45.680]   It gets harder and harder zen desk is with you every step of the way
[00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:51.960]   They give organizations the flexibility to move quickly to focus on innovation to adapt to growth
[00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:59.440]   And I think the proof is in the pudding a hundred fifty thousand paid customer accounts over a decade of experience
[00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:02.800]   Zen desk is I would say pretty good
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:06.040]   Now let's say darn good at customer experience themselves

[00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:44.440]   Now we go on with the show
[00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:48.920]   Uh, I guess one of the big stories
[00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:56.560]   Of ten years ago was the iPad and we celebrated its 10th anniversary this year
[00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:58.560]   We took a look back watch
[00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:04.040]   So this last week was the 10th anniversary the iPad. I thought the iPad was a pretty good thing. I like my iPad
[00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:06.440]   Apparently I'm I'm a loser
[00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:09.280]   Everybody agrees
[00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:10.760]   iPad
[00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:16.200]   Ben Thompson the headline on Stratecary the tragic iPad
[00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:25.040]   John Gruber it's a disappointment even in this even in this thing the vendor that you and everybody else got to do
[00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:27.040]   But I wasn't invited to the chase to sell does the
[00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:31.760]   Apple report card you would have given the iPad the D plus or something. I
[00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:35.400]   Thought the iPad was pretty good. What's wrong with the iPad?
[00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:43.800]   What'd you give it what'd you give it to vendor? I didn't I forget you don't remember it in the in the report card
[00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:50.920]   But it does seem like we surely give the iPad credit for being the lap the tablet that survived
[00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:58.200]   You know, it was the thing that inspired everybody to make tablets and now like they're there. There's certainly very few Android tablets
[00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:00.200]   I think are worth buying
[00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:04.920]   Microsoft took the strategy of like trying to turn windows into the tablet thing so
[00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:10.480]   convertible PCs technically or tablet like but I still don't like the way windows handles tablet stuff
[00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:16.120]   So you know the iPad is the only successful tablet and that makes a lot of sense. It's been doing good business for them
[00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:19.140]   I think where Apple falters is in terms of like supporting
[00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:27.000]   multitasking they were slow to that they were slow to like turning the iPad into a usable computing platform, but as a tablet
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:33.360]   You know, I think they deserve credit for at least being successful and you know trying to push things forward
[00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:35.360]   I will tell you what you said
[00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:43.000]   I have the transcript you actually say every gadget geek shit on one and actually I overstated its bad grade
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.940]   It got a B plus B plus sounds about right
[00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:51.320]   That's not really like as of last year or two years ago when the base iPad was like 230 bucks
[00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:55.040]   Like yeah, you should have one. Yeah, I have one like it's everybody
[00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:58.960]   So that was the first iPad I bought myself to and I bought it specifically
[00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:03.800]   So my parents can FaceTime my baby daughter and it's been perfect for that
[00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:06.400]   So every night at dinner time hit a button
[00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:09.840]   You know go straight to my mom's phone or my dad's phone and they get to see
[00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:16.160]   Sophia every single night and that is far easier than most other solutions out there one thing a lot of people agreed on
[00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:18.680]   including Ben Thompson and John Gruber is the
[00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:22.760]   multitasking the split screen in the slide over
[00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:29.520]   They they seem to agree that that's very poorly implemented. I think everybody on Mac break weekly said yeah
[00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:31.520]   They should just dump the multitasking
[00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:37.000]   Because it doesn't work very well and this they're they blame this not on Steve Jobs whose original conception
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:41.500]   They think was right on I would agree. Mm-hmm, but on subsequent
[00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:47.360]   Software developers over the years. I think how we could blame sorry we can we can blame
[00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:53.240]   Who's who's the scapegoat everybody at Apple blames for everything wrong with Apple?
[00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:55.240]   He was fired I can't really oh
[00:25:55.240 --> 00:26:01.620]   We got rid of him he's Johnny I know maybe you could blame Johnny now we blame Johnny. I for a lot
[00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:02.880]   Yeah
[00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:04.880]   got Ruben stein or somebody like that
[00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:08.800]   No, it was oh, I can't remember his name the map the guy that did the map stuff
[00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:15.040]   But but but Leo how much of this is and I think about this a lot like there's certain people out there
[00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:20.940]   Who maybe and maybe we can blame Steve Jobs because he made the trucks versus cars thing
[00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:28.600]   So there's a certain segment of people that believed that tablets would replace the you know
[00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:34.900]   The computer right and so the fact that ten years on that's what this is about right is that there are certain people that are
[00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:40.620]   disappointed that you still need something with a keyboard and a mouse and and but I
[00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:48.540]   So if it's just that it's not doing everything yet that doesn't mean that it's a failure as a product, right?
[00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:54.620]   No, I think it's I think a lot of the complaints are more that it should be better
[00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:58.380]   It should be more like stagnant
[00:26:58.380 --> 00:27:03.180]   That it's a little stagnant and I think with iPad OS that they've been making some progress
[00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:10.300]   But I guess people wanted more from the iPad I do feel like yeah the iPad Pro right was there next Scott for her
[00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:13.800]   Thank you, Jairam Scott. Yes, it's all Scott's fault
[00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:19.660]   iPad Pro though great hardware like we've loved the hardware. It's been well reviewed
[00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:24.340]   You know since they launched that thing and certainly in the most recent years like it's beautiful
[00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:28.060]   But the software has always been slow to catch up to that hardware
[00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:33.700]   So Apple they've been lagging on Mac OS software and iOS too like they have a lot of software innovation
[00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:37.540]   They really need to focus on but the iPad as a computer replacement
[00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:41.980]   I think a lot of people I talked to even texture analysts some people use that for all they do
[00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:43.780]   You know for image editing for reporting
[00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:45.500]   I personally couldn't live that way
[00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:50.660]   But it certainly it would be great for like a weekend way to go and just write a long thing and not have to worry too much about
[00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:54.140]   But that's my that's kind of my point is that it's all these people that are like well
[00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:55.740]   I'll never need a computer again
[00:27:55.740 --> 00:28:01.980]   I'll have this tablet and I can and and so it's just the disappointment of those people that imagine that that's what they were gonna
[00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:04.620]   Have by now and and what if the answer is is that?
[00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:10.620]   Again, you have a car for something you have a truck for something you got a semi for something like so alright
[00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:13.100]   A tablet is great for like you were saying
[00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:18.940]   I did face timing with the with the grandparents this afternoon like so
[00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:24.500]   So what that the tablet didn't kill the laptop like who cares? Yeah?
[00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:30.860]   Yeah, I think the problem is that it's all all of this stuff so expensive if like all of us
[00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:36.220]   Somebody's buying you this stuff. You can have an iPhone and Apple
[00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:43.900]   MacBook a Windows machine an iPad and then it kind of all is a continuum of stuff
[00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:45.300]   And you use the right thing for the right time
[00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:48.140]   But if you had only choose one probably wouldn't be the iPad
[00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:52.740]   Right and that normal people have to choose one. They're so expensive
[00:28:52.740 --> 00:29:02.300]   The from my friends the I don't use a Mac but the value prop that they have seen the most out of iOS 13 is sidecar
[00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:07.860]   And so it's it's they've given up on using the iPad for everything
[00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:14.700]   But as a companion to their laptop it is that feature makes it far more usable for them
[00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:19.620]   And so if Apple was choosing not to focus at being standalone
[00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:25.340]   But actually part of a workflow and where it's easy to work with it
[00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:33.820]   Applications or other hardware. I think that is the true nature and the true purpose of iPad where it could really shine
[00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:40.460]   Did Epson have a I don't think they had a Super Bowl ad rocket mortgage did that weird ad with Jason Momoa taking off his muscles
[00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:44.140]   That kind of creep me out. I loved it. Did you?
[00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:49.740]   I was it was it was a really memorable. Yeah, do you do you remember who the ad was for?
[00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:52.660]   It's for me
[00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:56.420]   He's for me because Aquaman is in it
[00:29:56.420 --> 00:30:03.300]   There is a great YouTube video. I recommend on the making of it. They show how they did it. They had a skinny guy and
[00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:09.580]   They had to match his movements and then they would use green screen and other CGI technologies to
[00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:15.700]   So because obviously he's he couldn't really take off his muscles. Is it I was it similar to the way that they did
[00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:20.900]   Captain America, right this would Steve Rogers was was a little guy, right?
[00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:23.620]   That's pretty cool. This is I mean with
[00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:31.780]   another Academy Award nominated film tonight is Irishman in which they make Robert De Niro Joe Pesci and
[00:30:31.780 --> 00:30:34.420]   Al Pacino look
[00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:37.980]   Like they're in their 40s when they're really in their 70s and 80s
[00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:42.540]   What did you think of that? Did it do did it work? Did that CGI work? I?
[00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:48.500]   Didn't actually see it, but it sounds to me like they just it was a little freaky
[00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:51.900]   Well, it was deep fakes. You're right. That's what it was
[00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:56.060]   And the other weird thing is I guess the director Martin Scorsese
[00:30:56.060 --> 00:30:59.380]   They said the problem is the acting's in the eyes so we can't change the eyes
[00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:05.740]   So they all had old eyes in young faces, which was very weird and then the other thing that was very hard to do
[00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:11.900]   And I guess they brought in movement coaches, but you don't move the same when you're in your 80s as you did when you were in your 40s
[00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:17.100]   So there's there's one scene where Robert De Niro is taking a hand gonna throw it in the bay as one does
[00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:21.020]   Uh to get rid of the evidence and he has to go over these rocks
[00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:24.300]   And you just want to leap out and say careful grandpa you're
[00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:30.540]   He's just a little he's just you just can tell he's not a 40 year old guy
[00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:33.340]   Yeah, I I argue that
[00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:40.380]   Deaging if we had had it for the godfather would have not had the great Robert De Niro
[00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:42.940]   Performance so he had in godfather 2
[00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:47.980]   Well, I'm saying and remember maybe you don't remember but I do that in godfather 1
[00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:54.860]   The studio did not want copala the cast martin marlin brando as the godfather because he was in his 40s
[00:31:54.860 --> 00:31:56.300]   He was a young guy
[00:31:56.300 --> 00:31:58.300]   And they forced him
[00:31:58.300 --> 00:32:01.100]   to do a test sequence with
[00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:07.100]   Brando it was the scene where he's in the olive oil company and they're trying to convince him to deal drugs
[00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:10.860]   And he does this as thank you, but no, thank you and they actually shot that
[00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:13.580]   To prove to the studio he can look old
[00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:16.380]   But that was all makeup
[00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:19.580]   And that's that actually that's an interesting point because in the old days
[00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:25.580]   If you think about movies like remember dusted hoffman little big man where he had to become a hundred-year-old guy
[00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:28.620]   And it didn't if you could tell it's makeup
[00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:35.340]   It's makeup, but we suspended disbelief we got well, yeah, it's because it's really rut Dustin
[00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:38.220]   His 30s wearing a lot of makeup
[00:32:38.220 --> 00:32:46.300]   Too bad makeup doesn't work the other way. Yeah, you can't D you can't D age people. What can you maybe you can?
[00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:51.500]   I mean, I think you could probably you could probably do which is like you you age yourself up
[00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:57.260]   Just a little bit with makeup so that when you do the when you do go the other way good makeup and good lighting
[00:32:57.340 --> 00:33:02.140]   Right like more fill lighting and stuff it would it would look like a bigger swing than it actually was
[00:33:02.140 --> 00:33:25.800]   How long did you know dineiro that had such a great performance in godfather 2 as a young marl
[00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:31.560]   Thought the movie it was it she all of her lines were very generic where it was like, I can't stand to lose you again
[00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:36.520]   Never underestimate adroit. It was like they were very non specific lines and you could tell
[00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:41.000]   If if you're in production, you could really tell that they wrote around a lot of that
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:42.040]   Okay
[00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:46.360]   But but they did one sequence that de-aged her and mark hamill
[00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:52.200]   Um to the events of shortly after return of the jedi was it believable?
[00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:55.240]   It was okay. It wasn't great
[00:33:55.240 --> 00:34:00.200]   But it was also kind of like it was quick enough that it was like, okay, that was fine
[00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:02.680]   But if they had used it the way that they did with
[00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:06.840]   grandma of tarkin in rogue one I
[00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:12.920]   I didn't I would not have enjoyed that that was really weird. I didn't think the man at tarkin was believable at all
[00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:18.040]   Yeah, yeah, it was very very weird. That was that was from whole cloth, right? They didn't have any footage
[00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:21.160]   Yeah, they had a stand in and then they just yeah
[00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:23.480]   This is very it's a very strange
[00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:28.360]   How long before these deep fakes because that's really what they are how yeah, that's
[00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:31.480]   how long before
[00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:35.640]   They're good enough that we could be fooled that way. They're not fooling us now, right?
[00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:40.680]   Yeah, some I think they are yes sometimes I think people
[00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:46.440]   Just like people have that short attention span and only share a headline if that that real quick kind of
[00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:48.680]   uh, you know
[00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:54.760]   Real quick at a glance. Oh my god. Can you believe this like person said this thing like I I think deep fakes are gonna get
[00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:56.840]   pretty
[00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:58.600]   pretty scary soon
[00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:02.040]   Nate you you uh you think what have you been fooled Nate?
[00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:05.960]   I well, I don't know maybe I have
[00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:11.240]   Maybe I have part of the problem. Yeah, that's part of the problem
[00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:16.440]   But the thing that I always interest that interests me with this is um is actually the psychological
[00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:18.920]   Aspect which is a lot of the time
[00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:26.280]   We see things that we want to see and we want to believe and so often I think that a deep fake only has to be good enough
[00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:29.960]   For somebody to believe what they're seeing is accurate
[00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:32.120]   I think it's different in films
[00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:38.920]   Because there's there are other elements of illusion of play there but with um with with politics in particular not to go back to uh
[00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:46.440]   The start of the show again. Um, I think that's where it gets particularly worrying because then they don't have to be absolutely perfect for somebody
[00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:52.120]   Who wants to believe what they're seeing is true to believe that it is true and then to spread it as if it was
[00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:58.520]   Um and for that it doesn't need perfection and that's why I think we're kind of already there and why it's already scary
[00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:04.680]   Don't attempt too much use it subtly use it as in just the right place
[00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:08.120]   Yeah, yeah
[00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:11.640]   And you know what people aren't very good. I have to you know, I have to agree with you because
[00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:17.560]   I watch videos all the time on reddit and elsewhere where I think that must be made up
[00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:27.000]   And but I don't know deep deep fake detection is certainly a growth industry right now apparently, uh, google's uh,
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   What do they call it the their political arm
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:37.560]   Has come up with a thing called assembler that can detect modified photos
[00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:42.360]   But they but they're going to and they're going to give it to journalists, but they're not going to give it to us
[00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:45.320]   Be nice if we had that
[00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:50.920]   Just reminds me of that really old meme. This is shopped. I can tell by the pixels
[00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:58.600]   But you can right the pixels will tell you won't they I guess so I mean, yeah
[00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:03.640]   Some I don't know. I want to come up with someone will find a way around, you know
[00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:07.640]   I wanted to believe that my uh refrigerator finally updated its firm years
[00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:12.120]   Firmware after five years and the chat room pointed out to me quickly that I may have been wrong
[00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:14.360]   What it didn't
[00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:19.720]   Well, I mean, it certainly appears that it did but all they have to do is put something up that says hey, we've right
[00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:22.600]   It's updated we fixed it
[00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:27.400]   I saw a
[00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:35.640]   Reddit maybe maybe maybe I found I blame you karstin for falling maybe maybe maybe there's there was on uh reddit
[00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:37.960]   Uh, there used to be a subreddit called
[00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:42.760]   Yes, yes, yes, and then one called no, no, no, but the problem with yes, yes
[00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:45.800]   Yes, yes and no, no, no as you'd know how the video was going to end yes
[00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:49.320]   Yes, yes, it was always going to end like wow it worked. No, no, no
[00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:53.640]   It was always going to end in disaster, but maybe maybe maybe combines both
[00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:58.280]   But cleverly eliminates any indication about which way it's going to go
[00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:05.940]   Let me see let me see if I can find the maybe maybe maybe I was looking at I showed it to a number of people
[00:38:06.020 --> 00:38:08.020]   And they said that's that's a fake
[00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:10.260]   And I thought oh
[00:38:10.260 --> 00:38:12.900]   Maybe it is. I can't I just don't know I can't tell
[00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:18.500]   I don't know if I'm gonna be able to find it. It was it was a claim to be a russian dash cam
[00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:20.500]   footage
[00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:27.620]   Of a little kid wandering into the street in the snow. Maybe you could find it karstin and uh and getting rescued
[00:38:27.620 --> 00:38:29.860]   and
[00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:31.860]   I thought it was real
[00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:34.340]   Do you remember that one?
[00:38:34.340 --> 00:38:36.340]   Do you think that was real?
[00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:38.660]   And then Lisa said that's not real
[00:38:38.660 --> 00:38:42.820]   Yeah, yeah, yeah
[00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:44.820]   That was real
[00:38:44.820 --> 00:38:46.820]   Are you sure?
[00:38:46.820 --> 00:38:48.580]   How do we know?
[00:38:48.580 --> 00:38:50.580]   How can we be how can we tell?
[00:38:50.580 --> 00:38:54.580]   Ready to say there's a little boy. He's running in the road. This is from russian
[00:38:54.580 --> 00:38:56.900]   dash cam footage
[00:38:56.900 --> 00:39:01.860]   Everybody's getting out there all worried car comes up picks the kid up by the collar and drives off
[00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:05.140]   saves him
[00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:07.140]   fake or real
[00:39:07.140 --> 00:39:09.300]   Why buy that is real
[00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:10.420]   Really?
[00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:11.620]   Gets him out of the road
[00:39:11.620 --> 00:39:12.900]   Yeah, it worked
[00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:15.700]   It's very dangerous by the way folks do not do this
[00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:19.220]   Do not do this if you slipped and dropped the kid
[00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:22.340]   You just run right over him
[00:39:22.340 --> 00:39:27.140]   I don't know. I believe everything except the kid the kids surprisingly colorful
[00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:30.420]   That's what I was thinking. Yeah, what do you think?
[00:39:31.060 --> 00:39:32.900]   Real fake
[00:39:32.900 --> 00:39:34.340]   And how would you know? What do you think?
[00:39:34.340 --> 00:39:39.060]   That's that I don't think I can tell maybe that's I don't know why it would be fake
[00:39:39.060 --> 00:39:43.940]   Right. See, yeah, that's like one. I don't know why it would be fake and also what is if it is fake
[00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:50.020]   What is the passenger in that car picking up in that child's place that they were placed with a kid?
[00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:52.900]   Could be a small animal could be a loaf of bread
[00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:58.260]   I think the thing that does make it a little more credible is at the very end when the mother comes and says oh god
[00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:00.500]   Grapes the kid away
[00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:03.140]   Chase Louise. What do you do?
[00:40:03.140 --> 00:40:06.020]   I just feel like it would be much more like if this was fake
[00:40:06.020 --> 00:40:09.140]   I mean you'd make it more exciting right you put him somewhere else
[00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:13.860]   But shouldn't the kid should the guy just get out of the car and help the kid back to the sidewalk?
[00:40:13.860 --> 00:40:15.700]   Well, it's cold outside Leo.
[00:40:15.700 --> 00:40:17.700]   Jay-Z
[00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:20.260]   Russian
[00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:22.100]   Very Russian. I got out
[00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:24.980]   He's like all right. What's going on here?
[00:40:24.980 --> 00:40:32.820]   Here's my question. Wait, okay. So am I to understand that is oh, he's the driver. Okay, so the driver is on is the driver on the right?
[00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:39.220]   No, I don't think this guy because this guy in the bus gets out and on on the our traditional driver side
[00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:44.180]   He is not the driver. So I assume it's right hand drive. Oh, so maybe it's not Russia
[00:40:44.180 --> 00:40:48.740]   Oh, you're right. He's not the boy. You're smart Ashley. I didn't know he wasn't the driver
[00:40:48.740 --> 00:40:52.420]   But you're right either he is not the driver or the car. He's lost control
[00:40:52.420 --> 00:40:55.460]   Yeah, the car is just the self-driving
[00:40:55.460 --> 00:40:57.460]   crappy with us
[00:40:57.460 --> 00:40:59.420]   Self-driving
[00:40:59.420 --> 00:41:05.300]   I paid for that. Yeah, if you bought it used he paid for FSD for sure. It hasn't been deactivated yet
[00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:08.100]   All right, this happened in 2017. I don't know
[00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:11.460]   Maybe the biggest story in tech this year
[00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:14.100]   Was covid of course
[00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:18.580]   But the effect covid had on a little company very few people had heard of
[00:41:19.300 --> 00:41:24.820]   That suddenly became a generic term for video conferencing. I'm talking about zoom
[00:41:24.820 --> 00:41:27.620]   The world has changed
[00:41:27.620 --> 00:41:31.700]   It's very in so many unusual and interesting ways
[00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:37.860]   Um, of course a lot of people who weren't using zoom all of a sudden are using zoom
[00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:40.100]   Which is I would guess the number one
[00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:42.660]   Video conferencing technology
[00:41:42.660 --> 00:41:48.900]   Zoom says they went from 10 million daily active users in december to 200 million last month
[00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:52.980]   Uh, and of course as a result we're seeing all sorts of problems
[00:41:52.980 --> 00:41:59.460]   First of all, that's crazy numbers by the way before we get into the problem
[00:41:59.460 --> 00:42:06.420]   I mean, when have you heard of a platform going from 10 to 200 in a month? That's since facebook
[00:42:06.420 --> 00:42:12.980]   Yeah, it's incredible. Yeah, I mean, that's probably the last time we've seen that type of growth right would be facebook would be
[00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:15.220]   And even then
[00:42:15.220 --> 00:42:18.100]   I don't know if you saw that uptick that quickly
[00:42:18.740 --> 00:42:22.980]   Yeah, potentially once they once they kind of hit their stride and we're going to more and more places
[00:42:22.980 --> 00:42:26.660]   Maybe you did like maybe once they really started investing in asia in south america
[00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:30.980]   But uh, that's probably the last time we've had a zoom wind
[00:42:30.980 --> 00:42:37.300]   It seems like there were was zoom the number one choice in bit. I mean, what about sisco webex or go to media
[00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:39.300]   No microsoft teams
[00:42:39.300 --> 00:42:41.300]   It's ease of use
[00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:44.580]   Yeah, it's the only one that really works. It's relatively cheap. Right?
[00:42:44.580 --> 00:42:47.140]   Sorry, go on. It's it's also
[00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:48.580]   that's
[00:42:48.580 --> 00:42:53.860]   That's the problem though is it was so easy to use that that's why they're running into these problems
[00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:58.580]   And some of the people are saying that some of the fixes that they're trying to do now are going to be
[00:42:58.580 --> 00:43:05.380]   Kind of shooting themselves on the foot because even doing something simple like having a password to join a
[00:43:05.380 --> 00:43:10.580]   A zoom call is going to make it more difficult for people to use. Yeah
[00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:13.300]   Well, uh, here's an interesting
[00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:17.540]   story zoom bombing is now a federal offense
[00:43:18.340 --> 00:43:20.340]   That could result in
[00:43:20.340 --> 00:43:22.100]   imprisonment
[00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:26.100]   I don't know if that's reduced the number of zoom bombs federal prosecutors are saying
[00:43:26.100 --> 00:43:32.340]   That if it was posted as a press release to the department of justice website and the us attorney's office
[00:43:32.340 --> 00:43:35.220]   For this for the eastern district
[00:43:35.220 --> 00:43:39.140]   Uh of um, I don't know what state of some state
[00:43:39.140 --> 00:43:43.140]   With support from the state attorney general and the fbi probably new york
[00:43:43.140 --> 00:43:46.020]   I would guess that that the most aggressive in something like this
[00:43:46.660 --> 00:43:50.660]   Um zoom bombing is a big problem for schools for churches
[00:43:50.660 --> 00:43:54.500]   Uh, I have a friend in a 12 step program or recovery program
[00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:57.460]   And of course they can't meet in person anymore. They do their
[00:43:57.460 --> 00:44:02.100]   Meetings as zoom and meetings and because they're public of necessity
[00:44:02.100 --> 00:44:06.500]   Uh, anybody can come in and people are doing horrific
[00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:09.540]   offensive triggering
[00:44:09.540 --> 00:44:11.460]   things uh
[00:44:11.460 --> 00:44:13.940]   Not just pornography not just racial epithets
[00:44:14.340 --> 00:44:17.860]   But intentionally going after alcoholics things like that
[00:44:17.860 --> 00:44:22.660]   It's it's just appalling and it's my understanding that a lot of the organizing is going on
[00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:24.820]   I'm sure it's happening at four chan and nine chan
[00:44:24.820 --> 00:44:29.780]   Uh, discourse is being used. There's a discourse channel for zoom bombing where they uh, share
[00:44:29.780 --> 00:44:35.220]   Publicate, um, ideas for zoom events so that they can all have so much fun
[00:44:35.220 --> 00:44:38.820]   It's just shocking really how awful some people can be
[00:44:38.820 --> 00:44:42.500]   Yeah, it's it's it's it's funny. My mom sent me
[00:44:43.060 --> 00:44:47.220]   Um, like an email. I guess this was maybe maybe Tuesday this week. Maybe Wednesday
[00:44:47.220 --> 00:44:52.900]   Um, we were I think in the the middle of either the first or the second wave of zoom scandals of the week
[00:44:52.900 --> 00:44:58.020]   And her bible study is going to be using zoom and she wanted to know she was like, should I use this?
[00:44:58.020 --> 00:44:59.540]   Maybe I don't want to bother with it at all
[00:44:59.540 --> 00:45:02.020]   And so I like sent her like a detailed thing
[00:45:02.020 --> 00:45:04.260]   I took the time to take the screenshots and go through the process
[00:45:04.260 --> 00:45:08.020]   I was like this is how you can join from your web browser. Just that's going to be your best bet
[00:45:08.020 --> 00:45:11.540]   You know, don't sign up for an account. Don't do the other things
[00:45:11.780 --> 00:45:17.300]   Um, but I was really proud of her a for reading and keeping up on it and be like asking. Okay
[00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:19.780]   What's the best way for me to do this?
[00:45:19.780 --> 00:45:21.780]   It's hard to miss the news. It's all over the place
[00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:24.260]   Because everybody's using it sure
[00:45:24.260 --> 00:45:30.340]   Yeah, definitely but still I'm I'm I'm still proud of my mom for wanting to like know like how can I mitigate even asking the question
[00:45:30.340 --> 00:45:34.340]   Should I be using this and like part of me wants to be like no don't use this at all
[00:45:34.340 --> 00:45:38.340]   Then another part of me is like, yeah, but I don't want you to miss out on being able to connect with people
[00:45:38.420 --> 00:45:43.300]   You know, that's that's to me. I think the hard thing about having the advice to just be don't use this product
[00:45:43.300 --> 00:45:47.300]   If you're an enterprise or a school or something, I think that's one thing where maybe you should
[00:45:47.300 --> 00:45:52.180]   Appeal to the higher authorities who make those decisions to say have you actually vetted this?
[00:45:52.180 --> 00:45:59.700]   But if the decision's already been made and this is what your school is using or your bible study or your um, you know, um, uh,
[00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:03.380]   You know, a meeting or something else. That's what they're choosing to do
[00:46:03.380 --> 00:46:05.780]   It's a really I think
[00:46:05.780 --> 00:46:11.060]   Not fair thing to say to regular people will just opt out of this just don't use this this communication
[00:46:11.060 --> 00:46:17.620]   It's the same thing when people say oh, just don't be on facebook, you know, where it's like, okay, that's that's really that comes from a really
[00:46:17.620 --> 00:46:20.980]   Purpose position to be able to make that point. Yeah, totally. Yeah
[00:46:20.980 --> 00:46:24.740]   And the thing about zoom look, there's still lots of great things about zoom
[00:46:24.740 --> 00:46:27.060]   It's funny. We used to have up until the last couple of years
[00:46:27.060 --> 00:46:32.980]   I've even been saying really until the last like 18 to 24 months when zoom has kind of gotten much more popular
[00:46:33.300 --> 00:46:35.300]   We used to have this joke
[00:46:35.300 --> 00:46:39.860]   For the last uh four or five years of you know, we've got now we've got self-driving cars
[00:46:39.860 --> 00:46:44.980]   But we still can't get a video call to work and we still can't get a power point, you know
[00:46:44.980 --> 00:46:47.620]   And zoom really has kind of solved that
[00:46:47.620 --> 00:46:54.820]   Um, it has gotten to where uh, it's made these things easy enough that you can get a lot of people connected
[00:46:54.820 --> 00:47:00.580]   Um, I agree with christina. It used people shouldn't be too freaked out about it
[00:47:00.580 --> 00:47:07.140]   Obviously the nsa shouldn't be using it for you know, uh, and and some companies that are doing corporate secrets
[00:47:07.140 --> 00:47:12.340]   You know, you saw spacex say that they're um, you know, they banned it. Well, that makes sense
[00:47:12.340 --> 00:47:19.460]   They're dealing with highly proprietary, um and sensitive information, right? Um, that that deals with their core business
[00:47:19.460 --> 00:47:20.740]   So
[00:47:20.740 --> 00:47:25.460]   That makes perfect sense for the average people, you know stuff. I had a friend that yesterday
[00:47:25.460 --> 00:47:28.020]   Um, did there on their zoom
[00:47:28.420 --> 00:47:33.700]   Um, they did a of their sister's baby shower and it was amazing and she talked about the fact that
[00:47:33.700 --> 00:47:40.660]   Um, what it's enabling them to do and I did one this wonderful organization called interfaith paths to peace because a lot of
[00:47:40.660 --> 00:47:44.420]   Um, uh, you know, a lot of religious organizations
[00:47:44.420 --> 00:47:48.420]   They don't really have tech departments and so this organization has helped
[00:47:48.420 --> 00:47:55.140]   Sort of provide a platform using zoom where people of different faiths can come together and um, you know
[00:47:55.540 --> 00:47:59.460]   Have fellowship and and be able to worship together and get inspiration
[00:47:59.460 --> 00:48:04.580]   So there's great things that are going on with zoom the thing where the the onus is is
[00:48:04.580 --> 00:48:09.620]   Um, the people who are hosting these meetings. They just need to implement a few good things
[00:48:09.620 --> 00:48:14.180]   Brian mentioned the um password thing which now zoom is kind of imposing
[00:48:14.180 --> 00:48:19.780]   You can still send somebody a zoom link with that password essentially embedded in that link
[00:48:20.180 --> 00:48:26.500]   And so it makes it easy for them to just click and join but if somebody's doing that random looking, you know
[00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:28.580]   typing in random zoom numbers or
[00:48:28.580 --> 00:48:31.780]   Finding, you know random, um, zoom
[00:48:31.780 --> 00:48:39.060]   Rooms to jump into they can't get in if they don't have the password and even then if you set up a waiting room
[00:48:39.060 --> 00:48:45.460]   The host of a zoom can help kind of screen people and if they see people that are jumping in and are being
[00:48:45.540 --> 00:48:50.820]   Appropriate you can hit the remove or you know jump them back to the waiting room if for some reason it somebody you
[00:48:50.820 --> 00:48:56.820]   Don't recognize so there's plenty of ways to mitigate this for most people that are using zoom
[00:48:56.820 --> 00:49:02.340]   It's just that the people who are using it and we're considering using it to do very proprietary things
[00:49:02.340 --> 00:49:10.500]   Um, they obviously need to think twice about it, but by the same token. It's still better than like we used to do these calls
[00:49:10.500 --> 00:49:11.780]   um
[00:49:11.780 --> 00:49:18.100]   Where you know you have your just your number you dial into an 800 number and then you put in your corporate sort of
[00:49:18.100 --> 00:49:25.300]   No over nine digit id. Well, the thing is we never knew who is on those calls with zoom at least right can see who who is on there
[00:49:25.300 --> 00:49:30.500]   And so it is generally even more secure even as insecure it is right now the problems
[00:49:30.500 --> 00:49:35.060]   It has with encryption and those kinds of things. It's still a step up from the average conference call
[00:49:35.060 --> 00:49:40.740]   But my my question is because you know, we we're largely we've been talking about consumers using this
[00:49:40.820 --> 00:49:47.860]   But the question that I have is you know, usually you see problems like this when you have a consumer product trying to move into enterprise
[00:49:47.860 --> 00:49:50.660]   This is an enterprise product that's suddenly being used by
[00:49:50.660 --> 00:49:57.060]   Consumers, but there are yeah security issues who where were the the cios and cto's
[00:49:57.060 --> 00:50:03.220]   Where was everybody like checking out all of the security problems that zoom had before this
[00:50:03.220 --> 00:50:06.100]   Yeah, I think that's a great question and
[00:50:06.100 --> 00:50:12.660]   I actually disagree. I disagree with zoom zoom says that they were in enterprise product that is now being used by consumers
[00:50:12.660 --> 00:50:19.700]   I I will I will say I think that's patently false and I think they're being misleading when they say that they may have had some specific enterprise
[00:50:19.700 --> 00:50:22.660]   You know implementations like apparently they have one for HIPAA
[00:50:22.660 --> 00:50:28.820]   But the vast majority of the times that I was using zoom was either for small teams things
[00:50:28.820 --> 00:50:34.260]   I saw a lot of startups using it individuals kind of wanting an easy way to set up conference things systems
[00:50:34.660 --> 00:50:39.540]   Um or or hobbyist, you know, so I think that really most of their users before this were
[00:50:39.540 --> 00:50:47.140]   Small businesses startups maybe me inside size business places that don't have cios and cto's
[00:50:47.140 --> 00:50:49.140]   That are going to be looking at index
[00:50:49.140 --> 00:50:55.940]   They would use the big sisco conferencing systems much more expensive much more complicated, but better quality
[00:50:55.940 --> 00:50:58.820]   Yeah, so I don't think it was
[00:50:58.820 --> 00:51:02.740]   Yeah, exactly. It's very much like slack in that sense and a lot of people use slack and zoom together
[00:51:02.820 --> 00:51:08.420]   And so I actually reject their statement that it was enterprise because I don't think it was if it was enterprise
[00:51:08.420 --> 00:51:14.820]   To your point Brian we wouldn't have seen some of these things because that would have been a complete like, you know, breaker
[00:51:14.820 --> 00:51:20.740]   But I think has happened though is that as there were companies even big companies that might not have had solutions
[00:51:20.740 --> 00:51:27.860]   That worked for this number of people like one of the big frankly like the secret soft of zoom not just its ease of use
[00:51:27.860 --> 00:51:34.340]   But also its quality and it's it's relative ease for having very large groups of video chat working together in a way that web
[00:51:34.340 --> 00:51:36.100]   Accents and some of the other solutions just can't do
[00:51:36.100 --> 00:51:42.580]   And to my to my knowledge, there's still the only you know solution where you can see kind of everyone's video at once
[00:51:42.580 --> 00:51:47.780]   In that kind of style and I know that some other products are working at bringing that type of feature
[00:51:47.780 --> 00:51:53.620]   Up, but but they're the only one who does it. There's a great actually there's a great open source solution
[00:51:53.620 --> 00:51:56.180]   That I use called jitzy
[00:51:56.180 --> 00:52:02.340]   Yeah, and I set up in about 10 minutes. I set up a jitzy server at home that we use
[00:52:02.340 --> 00:52:04.660]   But how many people can you do with that?
[00:52:04.660 --> 00:52:10.100]   Because I've heard that it really caps out around 12 or 13 and and so that would be my only like remark
[00:52:10.100 --> 00:52:15.300]   Because I'm talking about people who might need like 20 or it depends on bandwidth that you have available to it
[00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:17.700]   It can use it could do a hundred people easily in fact
[00:52:17.700 --> 00:52:23.380]   I've seen bandwidth tests with jitzy. It's very light on the CPU usage. It's really about bandwidth
[00:52:24.020 --> 00:52:28.420]   The thing to remember with any service is for a video service to work
[00:52:28.420 --> 00:52:32.340]   You know, especially in the way you want where you have the the grid of people
[00:52:32.340 --> 00:52:37.300]   You have to have it unencrypted at the server side and so when
[00:52:37.300 --> 00:52:41.860]   Zoom says it's end-to-end encrypted. That's not in the same way we understand end-to-end
[00:52:41.860 --> 00:52:49.300]   Which means no one can see it except the participants zoom can see it jitzy's the same way you you can you're it's it's encrypted
[00:52:49.300 --> 00:52:53.860]   But but at some point the server needs to coordinate so it needs to be unencrypted
[00:52:54.020 --> 00:52:59.540]   But the beauty is jitzy is it's open source. You can run your own server. I am and then it is fully private
[00:52:59.540 --> 00:53:01.460]   There's no one can see it
[00:53:01.460 --> 00:53:06.980]   It has it you know, it has some of the same problems zoom would have you still have to set up a password if you want to protect it
[00:53:06.980 --> 00:53:10.260]   And that's the big problem for churches for schools
[00:53:10.260 --> 00:53:15.940]   Maybe not so much schools, but certainly for churches and and recovery groups and groups that want to be public
[00:53:15.940 --> 00:53:19.060]   You can set up a waiting room. You can do all sorts of things
[00:53:19.060 --> 00:53:22.340]   But ultimately you can't lock it down because you want anybody who be able
[00:53:22.820 --> 00:53:28.340]   You know who wants to come to the meeting come to the meeting and says the problem people are having and that would be the same problem with it
[00:53:28.340 --> 00:53:30.340]   I think any service
[00:53:30.340 --> 00:53:32.980]   I think what happened though, I first hated zoom in
[00:53:32.980 --> 00:53:40.340]   Months ago when they had that problem and a security researcher warned about this with malware
[00:53:40.340 --> 00:53:48.260]   They installed on the Mac a web server a hidden web server that would run all the time on your Mac
[00:53:48.660 --> 00:53:52.580]   Their their idea was of course that you should be able to just click a link and zoom would launch
[00:53:52.580 --> 00:53:57.380]   But this hidden web server did not go away when you uninstall zoom it stayed there
[00:53:57.380 --> 00:54:04.820]   Again so that even if you uninstall zoom you click a link zoom behind the scenes does what it needs to do to get get a thing going
[00:54:04.820 --> 00:54:11.700]   And and hackers discovered it and started using it to inject malware in a Mac and tusches zoom had been warmed about this
[00:54:11.700 --> 00:54:15.940]   Drag their feet fixing it apple finally had to push out a fix on their own
[00:54:16.500 --> 00:54:22.580]   Apple actually had to push out a malware fix on mac and tusches because zoom wouldn't fix it that now zoom says
[00:54:22.580 --> 00:54:27.620]   You know in their credit, I guess that they're gonna stop they said this this week
[00:54:27.620 --> 00:54:29.620]   They're gonna stop working on new features
[00:54:29.620 --> 00:54:32.900]   Everybody on the zoom team is gonna work on privacy and security features
[00:54:32.900 --> 00:54:37.140]   So I guess the proof will be in the pudding but I I lost faith in zoom
[00:54:37.140 --> 00:54:42.660]   When they claimed and then encryption when that wasn't the case and when they didn't fix this server problem
[00:54:42.660 --> 00:54:45.860]   And of course then there have been other reported issues the iOS
[00:54:46.340 --> 00:54:50.980]   Version sent data to facebook because they used a facebook SDK zoom stopped doing that
[00:54:50.980 --> 00:54:56.020]   But they only seem to stop this stuff after they get caught they were routing calls through a china call center
[00:54:56.020 --> 00:55:00.900]   They said oops we did that because we were so loaded up. Oops. Well, we won't do that anymore
[00:55:00.900 --> 00:55:06.420]   I don't know. I'm not against zoom. I and I've tried by the way we use it for all our sales calls
[00:55:06.420 --> 00:55:10.820]   I've tried to get Lisa. I said, you know, there's I have this great jitzy server
[00:55:10.820 --> 00:55:14.820]   You could use this it even has our brand in the name because I set up a domain for it
[00:55:15.220 --> 00:55:20.500]   Said, no, everybody knows zoom. Everybody knows zoom and it's hard to get people to use something else
[00:55:20.500 --> 00:55:24.500]   So i'm hoping zoom will step up there. There's an opportunity here for them to step up
[00:55:24.500 --> 00:55:30.260]   I'm hoping they are too, but I'm with you look when the thing happened last summer with them installing the web server
[00:55:30.260 --> 00:55:34.500]   And honestly it was their response to that that really bothered me more than it was even the act itself
[00:55:34.500 --> 00:55:40.020]   That that initially they they barred the the security researcher they wouldn't communicate
[00:55:40.020 --> 00:55:43.460]   They tried to kind of sweep it under the rug say that it wasn't a big deal
[00:55:43.540 --> 00:55:50.180]   And then once they were properly chasing they had a belated apology and the whole thing put a bad taste in my mouth and it was very face booky
[00:55:50.180 --> 00:55:55.380]   Very much. So and move fast break things apologize later than keep doing it
[00:55:55.380 --> 00:55:59.300]   And our team had had been using zoom and after that we were like, we're done
[00:55:59.300 --> 00:56:01.140]   We're not using this anymore
[00:56:01.140 --> 00:56:04.420]   And so I was done with it then but again if someone else wants to use it for something
[00:56:04.420 --> 00:56:06.180]   I'm not going to be like
[00:56:06.180 --> 00:56:09.540]   Zellidis about like oh, I refuse to to use the system you want to do
[00:56:10.020 --> 00:56:13.540]   What bothers me now though and and this is the thing that bothers me from
[00:56:13.540 --> 00:56:21.940]   All the different issues they've had is that a I think that one of the reasons that we're seeing this is because they've gone from 10 million to 200 million users
[00:56:21.940 --> 00:56:25.220]   So they're getting an outsized, you know amount of attention
[00:56:25.220 --> 00:56:28.660]   And I think if you put this attention on any sort of service you would see
[00:56:28.660 --> 00:56:31.300]   You would also be able to find flaws, right?
[00:56:31.300 --> 00:56:34.660]   But the thing that bothers me is that they have this amazing
[00:56:35.140 --> 00:56:41.620]   Differentiator in the IRC right now. We're kind of all talking about how the system hasn't changed in 22 years and they're all terrible
[00:56:41.620 --> 00:56:47.220]   And that's basically true zoom has been the first thing that works really well. It's easy to set up
[00:56:47.220 --> 00:56:49.300]   I think the reason you saw businesses
[00:56:49.300 --> 00:56:52.420]   Enterprises who maybe normally would have gone through a stronger vetting process
[00:56:52.420 --> 00:56:55.860]   Not go through that process as they suddenly had to be remote for the first time
[00:56:55.860 --> 00:56:59.620]   And needed to support a large number of people and just started with it, right?
[00:56:59.620 --> 00:57:02.820]   So I think that's another reason why it's had so much adoption
[00:57:03.220 --> 00:57:08.580]   But they have this huge differentiator. They are easy to use. It's well done. It has good features
[00:57:08.580 --> 00:57:09.780]   It's high quality
[00:57:09.780 --> 00:57:15.220]   That's something that is a massive differentiator and rather than using that as the selling point and rather than using that
[00:57:15.220 --> 00:57:18.100]   As what they want to focus on everything that they've done
[00:57:18.100 --> 00:57:23.700]   It seems like has been in you know search of like sort of growth hacking and and kind of cutting corners
[00:57:23.700 --> 00:57:27.220]   And it makes me question a lot of fundamental things about the company
[00:57:27.220 --> 00:57:29.220]   I love the product but I'm not
[00:57:29.300 --> 00:57:33.940]   To be totally honest, I'm not convinced by even that the latest blog post that the CEO put out
[00:57:33.940 --> 00:57:38.900]   I don't really feel like I believe anything. I don't feel like they have proven themselves be trustworthy
[00:57:38.900 --> 00:57:41.300]   Which is so disappointing because this is
[00:57:41.300 --> 00:57:46.180]   Gen genuinely a product that is head and shoulders a bed of the competition and
[00:57:46.180 --> 00:57:49.380]   I feel like they're squandering a lot of this by
[00:57:49.380 --> 00:57:53.140]   Going after ways to growth hack a lot of things that make zoom good
[00:57:53.140 --> 00:57:57.780]   Jitsi does for instance jitsi uses a more modern protocol web rtc
[00:57:58.340 --> 00:58:01.460]   Which means you don't have to install any software if you're using chrome
[00:58:01.460 --> 00:58:05.620]   It's just a link and it does it in chrome without any additional software
[00:58:05.620 --> 00:58:08.980]   Uh, and that's really nice that really is easy to use
[00:58:08.980 --> 00:58:14.260]   And just see that's great. I think if we're being honest the setup process of people getting started with jitsi meat
[00:58:14.260 --> 00:58:16.660]   Whether they use that service or set up their own instance
[00:58:16.660 --> 00:58:18.100]   You don't have to set up anything
[00:58:18.100 --> 00:58:22.420]   I could send you a link right now and you could use it in your browser. No setup. You're just in
[00:58:22.420 --> 00:58:26.100]   That's pretty easy
[00:58:26.100 --> 00:58:29.380]   Right, but I mean like if you're a bit if you're a business and you want to set up your own instance
[00:58:29.380 --> 00:58:33.140]   Is what I meant like if you wanted to control you don't have to they offer a free a free version
[00:58:33.140 --> 00:58:35.460]   and honestly if you've got uh
[00:58:35.460 --> 00:58:37.540]   Debbie and running or any any debbie and
[00:58:37.540 --> 00:58:43.940]   Derivative running. It's a simple apt install apt install jitsi meat. You're done. It does let's encrypt automatically
[00:58:43.940 --> 00:58:49.060]   You're done. It was so easy for me to set up. It was trivial. I agree many businesses aren't going to want to do that
[00:58:49.060 --> 00:58:50.740]   But you don't have to do that
[00:58:50.740 --> 00:58:51.700]   Um
[00:58:51.700 --> 00:58:54.820]   I could set up watch. I'll just I'll send you a link right now. You can try it
[00:58:55.220 --> 00:59:02.260]   Go to twitch. I I I would be I would be cautious about whether jitsi could support 200 billion daily active users. Should we see
[00:59:02.260 --> 00:59:10.740]   Let's see twit. Um, let's just uh, let's just see. I'm gonna set it up
[00:59:10.740 --> 00:59:13.620]   Uh secure connection failed. Uh oh
[00:59:13.620 --> 00:59:17.140]   Maybe maybe not nevermind. We'll do this another time
[00:59:17.140 --> 00:59:21.060]   I don't know what happened there
[00:59:21.060 --> 00:59:21.940]   Uh
[00:59:21.940 --> 00:59:28.980]   I think one of the things we have to also take into account, um, you know, there's a lot of self-inflicted wounds on on zoom's part
[00:59:28.980 --> 00:59:30.820]   Um to christina's
[00:59:30.820 --> 00:59:32.820]   Yeah, but that's the question is
[00:59:32.820 --> 00:59:35.380]   Is it accidental?
[00:59:35.380 --> 00:59:41.060]   Or are these guys nefarious as bruche snire said in his post the errors that uh zoom
[00:59:41.060 --> 00:59:48.420]   Has committed fall into three broad practices bad privacy bad security bad user configurations
[00:59:48.820 --> 00:59:52.980]   That doesn't that doesn't sound like ineptitude that's starting to sound a little bit like
[00:59:52.980 --> 00:59:57.220]   And there's a fourth too because they were sort of leaving doors open to do
[00:59:57.220 --> 01:00:02.420]   Tracking and yeah, they were well because they had a free tier and they wanted to monetize the free tier
[01:00:02.420 --> 01:00:05.380]   I don't know go ahead Jason. I think
[01:00:05.380 --> 01:00:10.020]   Yeah, no, I think that the the the comparison the early facebook is especially
[01:00:10.020 --> 01:00:16.820]   I think poignant because of they were it was it was very much like you say move fast break things innovate
[01:00:17.380 --> 01:00:20.980]   Create a great product and you apologize later when we make some mistakes
[01:00:20.980 --> 01:00:22.420]   Um
[01:00:22.420 --> 01:00:25.460]   Not a great business model. I think oh, you know facebook is
[01:00:25.460 --> 01:00:32.900]   Is finally feeling the pain of that from a user standpoint and and it's likely to although there it has been
[01:00:32.900 --> 01:00:39.140]   Some indication that more some of the people who've left facebook are going back during this time
[01:00:39.140 --> 01:00:43.620]   But also people have a ton of time on their hands. So, you know, I I don't know if I take that as a long term
[01:00:43.620 --> 01:00:45.220]   um
[01:00:45.220 --> 01:00:47.220]   yet
[01:00:47.220 --> 01:00:49.700]   For geeks. So this is for all of us a question
[01:00:49.700 --> 01:00:55.140]   Because we all this is not an unusual conundrum for geeks. We know better
[01:00:55.140 --> 01:01:00.180]   We know that this isn't a good idea. We know what's wrong with it. We know in great detail. What's wrong with it
[01:01:00.180 --> 01:01:04.660]   And yet, I mean I had a we had a family meeting on friday
[01:01:04.660 --> 01:01:10.500]   And I tried to use my server my jitzy and one one member couldn't get it working. So we a we went back to zoom
[01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:16.660]   For geeks. It's easy to say. Oh, yeah, here's all the reasons. But as you said, christina. It's hard
[01:01:17.380 --> 01:01:23.060]   And zoom just works. It's the other side of five g's calling co causing covid. It's just
[01:01:23.060 --> 01:01:25.620]   Oh, don't even get it's just more noise
[01:01:25.620 --> 01:01:30.500]   Even I like of all the crazy nonsense that i've heard
[01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:37.140]   linking five g to covid is probably the strangest and like the dumst
[01:01:37.140 --> 01:01:42.100]   I think what you have to do is you have to think what is that what is what is the psychological
[01:01:42.820 --> 01:01:46.500]   Reason for that and it's like net blood. It's you know
[01:01:46.500 --> 01:01:54.100]   The modern times are causing the covid. What's the most modern thing thing in my neighborhood? Oh, it's that five g tower
[01:01:54.100 --> 01:02:00.260]   Yeah, but I mean people in the uk we've had 25 g towers burned down in the uk at the moment
[01:02:00.260 --> 01:02:06.820]   I mean, it's just the right there's a psychological thing. It's not you know, i'm just i don't feel like
[01:02:06.820 --> 01:02:10.500]   People dark people you think people are rational people are not rational
[01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:14.420]   They act emotionally and then use reason to justify the the emotional
[01:02:14.420 --> 01:02:19.220]   Uh thing that they chose I fear you I fear your wise ahead may be right on that one
[01:02:19.220 --> 01:02:24.740]   But I got to say when you've got a bunch of d-list celebrities going oh, well, you know five g might be the cause no
[01:02:24.740 --> 01:02:27.220]   It's just like
[01:02:27.220 --> 01:02:30.740]   You know, it's like saying can opens a cause of botulism it
[01:02:30.740 --> 01:02:32.900]   Well, it's obviously nutty
[01:02:32.900 --> 01:02:35.140]   I wonder even if the people who are destroying the towers
[01:02:35.140 --> 01:02:38.180]   Feel the same way, but it's just so satisfying
[01:02:38.820 --> 01:02:42.020]   We see at first I thought it was like kids under lockdown
[01:02:42.020 --> 01:02:47.460]   Go out do a bit of vandalism make it make yourself feel better fair enough. It's a British tradition
[01:02:47.460 --> 01:02:52.100]   But when you actually get because that happening in other countries as much is it?
[01:02:52.100 --> 01:02:54.820]   I don't think we've had five g vandalism here
[01:02:54.820 --> 01:03:02.340]   A few cases in europe but other than that fine, but you know if five g really was the cause of this you'd expect the highest
[01:03:03.140 --> 01:03:09.300]   You know outbreaks of coronavirus in 5g areas like finland where they've had one day nonsense
[01:03:09.300 --> 01:03:13.380]   It's obviously nonsense. No, I always like to figure out
[01:03:13.380 --> 01:03:15.940]   Why so like what was yeah?
[01:03:15.940 --> 01:03:21.860]   What is it that people are seeking in this and I think it comes back to certainty?
[01:03:21.860 --> 01:03:24.500]   um five so again like
[01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:26.260]   so they
[01:03:26.260 --> 01:03:32.020]   There's a problem with having too much data sometimes too much data is bad and sometimes not enough data is bad
[01:03:32.100 --> 01:03:35.860]   Too much information is sometimes bad. Not enough information is sometimes bad
[01:03:35.860 --> 01:03:40.180]   That is the current situation that we are living in and I think with 5g
[01:03:40.180 --> 01:03:44.100]   Which is kind of like difficult to actually understand
[01:03:44.100 --> 01:03:51.140]   Um, you know, I think the problem is you have some people with too much of the wrong information and then a whole bunch of people
[01:03:51.140 --> 01:03:56.500]   With no information. There's no center ground where cooler heads prevail
[01:03:56.500 --> 01:04:00.340]   Yeah, and also cooler heads don't make right headlines
[01:04:00.820 --> 01:04:02.820]   You know, I mean if if you I mean
[01:04:02.820 --> 01:04:07.540]   It's changed there's a British paper called the national paper called the daily express
[01:04:07.540 --> 01:04:13.860]   Which used to be a very good paper, but it's now all about asteroids and you know conspiracy theories and the rest of it
[01:04:13.860 --> 01:04:17.860]   My gran used to read that, you know and took it as a gospel
[01:04:17.860 --> 01:04:22.420]   You know that we we do have this information overload that we you know and people who decide well
[01:04:22.420 --> 01:04:24.180]   I read it on the internet
[01:04:24.180 --> 01:04:27.700]   and we need to teach media savvy to people just to
[01:04:28.340 --> 01:04:32.980]   With anything that you read who wrote it? Why did they wrote it and who paid for it to be written?
[01:04:32.980 --> 01:04:36.820]   Those are the three key questions you have to ask all right. I want to make two columns
[01:04:36.820 --> 01:04:39.780]   it's like tired and wired, but it's not it's like
[01:04:39.780 --> 01:04:42.740]   pre-covid post-covid or
[01:04:42.740 --> 01:04:44.020]   or
[01:04:44.020 --> 01:04:49.460]   No, so for instance malls malls pre-covid there were malls post-covid
[01:04:49.460 --> 01:04:53.380]   No malls amazon amazon amazon, right? Yeah
[01:04:53.380 --> 01:04:57.380]   Yeah, there's like a hundred shopping malls that are due to clothes over the next
[01:04:57.940 --> 01:05:01.380]   Month or so the numbers are staggering and they're not coming back
[01:05:01.380 --> 01:05:03.940]   No, no like permanently no
[01:05:03.940 --> 01:05:06.020]   Sad to say a lot of
[01:05:06.020 --> 01:05:07.460]   Restaurants
[01:05:07.460 --> 01:05:12.980]   Are gone won't come back right because they just they're out of they're out of business
[01:05:12.980 --> 01:05:16.020]   Anything that was hanging by a fragile thread
[01:05:16.020 --> 01:05:20.100]   That threads being cut right now, right? I mean
[01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:26.660]   I mean our local Indian place is
[01:05:26.660 --> 01:05:29.380]   They've seen their
[01:05:29.380 --> 01:05:32.580]   Taking is dropped by 80 percent. It's the same there where the restaurant
[01:05:32.580 --> 01:05:34.340]   I have to
[01:05:34.340 --> 01:05:39.060]   An apology for British listeners at the moment, but I went to get my this may cause amusement
[01:05:39.060 --> 01:05:44.500]   I meant meant to get my growler filled at the local pub now for American listeners growler
[01:05:44.500 --> 01:05:50.420]   It's the bottle that you feel you beer up with yeah British listeners. It's something rather rude
[01:05:50.660 --> 01:05:52.420]   so
[01:05:52.420 --> 01:05:57.940]   Growler to a to a recently did there's no way they put me man
[01:05:57.940 --> 01:06:06.900]   Um, yeah, no the I'm doing a lot of years going stale in the barrels. We need you to add more beer in a local brew pub sells
[01:06:06.900 --> 01:06:09.300]   sells growlers for two hours a day
[01:06:09.300 --> 01:06:11.300]   so um
[01:06:11.300 --> 01:06:15.940]   To this may cause amusement for British friends, but a nice young man filled my growler with his fat pipe
[01:06:18.820 --> 01:06:24.980]   Drive in movies making a comeback, right? We can also knock cars. Yeah, rolled up the windows
[01:06:24.980 --> 01:06:28.740]   You know, yeah, remember in 1965
[01:06:28.740 --> 01:06:34.660]   I'm old enough to remember going to the US the New York World's Fair and AT&T had a video phone
[01:06:34.660 --> 01:06:39.220]   They said, you know by 1970 we'll all be using video phones
[01:06:39.220 --> 01:06:44.020]   And I remember in 2001 in 1977 the tooth that movie 2001
[01:06:44.260 --> 01:06:50.740]   He's he's on the moon. He's talking to his daughter and his wife on earth via a video phone and a video phone
[01:06:50.740 --> 01:06:55.620]   Both and it never took off all of a sudden. We're all making video calls
[01:06:55.620 --> 01:07:01.380]   I think this this might have been the impetus to finally get us over the hump because we didn't want it
[01:07:01.380 --> 01:07:04.900]   I think people didn't want it, but now they're making video calls and I don't think we're gonna stop
[01:07:04.900 --> 01:07:08.580]   I think that this is that's a that's something that's changed dramatically
[01:07:08.580 --> 01:07:13.940]   I mean, I think within the IT industry as well one of the big big changes is going to be conferences
[01:07:14.420 --> 01:07:21.860]   Because conferences in this year it's over. It's over. I'm not going to see yes ever ever ever ever again
[01:07:21.860 --> 01:07:26.100]   Well, I mean see yes at the end of the year. Okay. Sorry. Amy, please
[01:07:26.100 --> 01:07:29.140]   I
[01:07:29.140 --> 01:07:31.380]   Conferences are not over
[01:07:31.380 --> 01:07:34.100]   For a couple of very practical reasons
[01:07:34.100 --> 01:07:38.500]   Um, the first of which is that people are humans are social
[01:07:39.140 --> 01:07:45.620]   So there is no way people are gonna opt for no gathering or a virtual gathering over an imperson
[01:07:45.620 --> 01:07:49.220]   In-person gathering it might take a year for us to get
[01:07:49.220 --> 01:07:56.660]   Back into the swing of things, but to me this is a little analogous to nine after 9/11 when everybody said nobody's gonna fly again
[01:07:56.660 --> 01:08:01.860]   You know, we just we have to sort of wait it out to have the new protocols and for people to feel confident
[01:08:01.860 --> 01:08:06.420]   And then everybody's gonna be back on planes. Anybody gonna go on a cruise ship ever again
[01:08:07.700 --> 01:08:10.100]   That's you you you're from decreases. Yes
[01:08:10.100 --> 01:08:12.660]   Uh
[01:08:12.660 --> 01:08:15.540]   I was talking yesterday with johnny jedi our travel guy
[01:08:15.540 --> 01:08:21.620]   And his thesis was you're not going to see widespread air travel or cruise travel or
[01:08:21.620 --> 01:08:24.340]   maybe even conferences until we have
[01:08:24.340 --> 01:08:30.580]   Fast universal testing so that you can go to the airport five minutes early
[01:08:30.580 --> 01:08:37.380]   Get us swab or spit in a vial get tested if you pass you can board the plane if not you can
[01:08:38.100 --> 01:08:40.100]   It was hard to pick just one
[01:08:40.100 --> 01:08:42.580]   But I think the weirdest story
[01:08:42.580 --> 01:08:49.460]   This year about elan was the name he picked for his new child
[01:08:49.460 --> 01:08:52.340]   And how to pronounce it
[01:08:52.340 --> 01:08:54.900]   So let's see
[01:08:54.900 --> 01:08:57.220]   I keep wondering if there's gonna be any tech news
[01:08:57.220 --> 01:09:02.820]   You know each week I go we're gonna have anything to talk about thank god elan musk exists
[01:09:05.940 --> 01:09:08.980]   x ae a 12
[01:09:08.980 --> 01:09:13.380]   Can't really be the name of the kid
[01:09:13.380 --> 01:09:18.820]   elan musk and grimes have had a baby they had a son on monday
[01:09:18.820 --> 01:09:24.180]   Uh, they elan tweeted out that strange name
[01:09:24.180 --> 01:09:27.540]   Uh
[01:09:27.540 --> 01:09:30.500]   Joe rogan asked him on thursday. How do you say the name?
[01:09:31.940 --> 01:09:40.180]   musk says the name's pretty much pronounced x ash a 12 ae some speculated was actually ash it's a
[01:09:40.180 --> 01:09:45.540]   Aleted a and e some languages happen. It's often pronounced ash
[01:09:45.540 --> 01:09:52.260]   He's musk said first of all grimes is the one that came up mostly came up with the name. It's just x the letter x
[01:09:52.260 --> 01:09:55.700]   Grimes in her tweet said it's the unknown
[01:09:55.700 --> 01:09:57.380]   X
[01:09:57.380 --> 01:10:01.460]   Ae is pronounced ash so obviously the kid's name is ash right you're gonna
[01:10:01.460 --> 01:10:08.740]   Just the rest of it is extra and then a 12 elan said is my contribution the a 12 stands for the archangel 12
[01:10:08.740 --> 01:10:10.980]   the precursor
[01:10:10.980 --> 01:10:13.380]   to the sr-71 the blackbird
[01:10:13.380 --> 01:10:17.220]   Which was uh, that's phantom spy plane right?
[01:10:17.220 --> 01:10:20.500]   coolest plane ever elan said
[01:10:20.500 --> 01:10:23.380]   If you want to hear musk say it
[01:10:24.260 --> 01:10:30.420]   He says 37 seconds into joe's show elan did not toke up on the show though. I think right not
[01:10:30.420 --> 01:10:35.380]   Holy cow learned his lesson learned his lesson
[01:10:35.380 --> 01:10:43.060]   Anyway, thank you elan for giving us something to talk about that's twit for the week. Thank you everybody good. No
[01:10:43.060 --> 01:10:49.300]   I think and you know what the timing is good because we got nothing else to do
[01:10:49.300 --> 01:10:52.100]   this might be the most important week in computing
[01:10:52.820 --> 01:10:55.940]   in this century for sure perhaps
[01:10:55.940 --> 01:11:03.940]   I don't know perhaps I don't I can't think of another time with even the mac transition to intel. I don't think was this important
[01:11:03.940 --> 01:11:09.700]   Uh, and of course what i'm talking about is the worldwide developers conference kicked off on monday. It was going all week
[01:11:09.700 --> 01:11:13.620]   I'm sure that's all you guys have been doing all week long, which is why you're here to fill me in
[01:11:13.620 --> 01:11:18.980]   Uh, I did watch the keynote in the state of the union, which is the more techie kind of follow up
[01:11:18.980 --> 01:11:22.980]   They did on monday. We even streamed both of those with commentary
[01:11:22.980 --> 01:11:28.500]   And then i've been reading incessantly ever since even to the point where I downloaded xcode
[01:11:28.500 --> 01:11:30.820]   the xcode beta
[01:11:30.820 --> 01:11:36.660]   Picked up, uh, you know the uh, I think I started this stanford cs 193 course and ios development
[01:11:36.660 --> 01:11:41.060]   And uh and started to dig into swift ui because I think
[01:11:41.060 --> 01:11:44.900]   We are going to enter a new era of computing and here's here's my
[01:11:44.900 --> 01:11:48.180]   And you tell me you guys could talk me down and say i'm full of it
[01:11:48.580 --> 01:11:50.580]   But my thesis is
[01:11:50.580 --> 01:11:54.180]   Uh, we certainly began a new era of computing in 2007 when the iphone came out
[01:11:54.180 --> 01:11:57.940]   We didn't know it at the time, but that was going to transform computing all of a sudden
[01:11:57.940 --> 01:12:03.140]   The vast bulk of computing is now done on a thing that's in your pocket. It's always connected to the internet
[01:12:03.140 --> 01:12:06.580]   It's omni-present social media facebook and twitter
[01:12:06.580 --> 01:12:12.020]   Were began on the desktop, but really wouldn't be as powerful as they are without the smartphone
[01:12:12.020 --> 01:12:18.500]   Um, that transformed everything and apple became as a result the most valuable company in the history of the world
[01:12:18.820 --> 01:12:21.620]   Now worth close to a hundred a million a trillion and a half dollars
[01:12:21.620 --> 01:12:24.100]   They have hundreds of billions of dollars of cash
[01:12:24.100 --> 01:12:31.700]   Uh, they're a behemoth a juggernaut the ipad which had a lot of promise 10 years ago didn't really seem to take off
[01:12:31.700 --> 01:12:36.500]   But what I think I didn't fully appreciate i'm sure you guys did
[01:12:36.500 --> 01:12:43.940]   But what I didn't fully appreciate is that from day one of the iphone coming out apple was preparing for something different
[01:12:44.420 --> 01:12:49.460]   As certainly once they realized how successful the ipad was apple started preparing with their own chips
[01:12:49.460 --> 01:12:52.340]   Uh, they started moving to technologies like metal
[01:12:52.340 --> 01:12:58.100]   They started to do a lot of things that's really accelerated over the last couple of years with things like catalyst
[01:12:58.100 --> 01:13:04.420]   To move into a new world of computing an ecosystem. They could utterly
[01:13:04.420 --> 01:13:08.900]   dominate and that with the announcement that they were going to finally abandon
[01:13:09.700 --> 01:13:15.140]   An architecture that's been around since the 70s x86 1974 x86
[01:13:15.140 --> 01:13:22.180]   And move to apple silicon. This was the for me the piece that went oh click and the whole thing
[01:13:22.180 --> 01:13:29.380]   We're i seem to come clear to me. We're in a transformational moment. Am I not stan morn?
[01:13:29.380 --> 01:13:34.580]   I know not at all. I think this is a big deal from the perspective because I mean
[01:13:35.140 --> 01:13:39.300]   The iphone in the earliest days they were still sort of figuring out where it was
[01:13:39.300 --> 01:13:41.540]   But once they started rolling out their own processors
[01:13:41.540 --> 01:13:44.100]   I think it was only a matter of time and
[01:13:44.100 --> 01:13:50.100]   Increasingly in the last several years as they put their own processors in like the apple tv and the home pod and the apple watch
[01:13:50.100 --> 01:13:53.460]   You started to step back and say why isn't this in the mac?
[01:13:53.460 --> 01:13:56.020]   Why is the mac now the only device they make
[01:13:56.020 --> 01:14:02.260]   There's running on somebody else's processor when they have done all this amazing work because we would keep seeing
[01:14:02.660 --> 01:14:06.900]   When the phones came out, you know, they'd be benchmarking them and these things would be off the charts
[01:14:06.900 --> 01:14:13.140]   And you'd be comparing them against laptops and you're like why this this chip in a phone is outpacing this laptop that costs
[01:14:13.140 --> 01:14:19.220]   Twice as much and is supposedly like this really powerful device. They make why can't they bring that ability
[01:14:19.220 --> 01:14:22.180]   Over to the mac side as well and I think
[01:14:22.180 --> 01:14:26.740]   Apple has shown time after time that they love controlling the whole
[01:14:26.740 --> 01:14:30.100]   Hardware the hardware the software everything the whole device
[01:14:30.580 --> 01:14:36.340]   Because they can optimize it to do exactly what they needed to do and I think that it is
[01:14:36.340 --> 01:14:39.460]   Fundamentally a huge change obviously for the mac
[01:14:39.460 --> 01:14:45.060]   But it really only solidifies something that we've seen with the iphone and the ipad over the last decade or so
[01:14:45.060 --> 01:14:49.300]   And you know famously I think they you know originally started out wanting to build something
[01:14:49.300 --> 01:14:53.700]   Like the ipad and the iphone ended up being kind of a diversion along the way
[01:14:53.700 --> 01:14:58.660]   Which is you know, of course hilarious because it's a huge huge portion of their money now
[01:14:59.300 --> 01:15:04.340]   But yeah, I I think that now that they're putting everything they run on their own custom silicon
[01:15:04.340 --> 01:15:09.940]   I think we've just dipped our toe into what is going to be an enormous change for the mac
[01:15:09.940 --> 01:15:14.340]   And that's saying something for a platform that's undergone so many transitions in its history
[01:15:14.340 --> 01:15:22.740]   I think it speaks a lot to not just the future of mac but the future of computing in general because if apple is going to be doing
[01:15:22.740 --> 01:15:26.420]   If they're going to be competing in this space in this process or chip space
[01:15:26.740 --> 01:15:31.540]   Intel has to do something to to match that so that pcs can can build
[01:15:31.540 --> 01:15:34.100]   You know into the future as well
[01:15:34.100 --> 01:15:38.020]   And this could also really just be a huge improvement for microsoft and
[01:15:38.020 --> 01:15:41.460]   You know all all the other chip makers all the other processor
[01:15:41.460 --> 01:15:47.300]   Manufacturers out there to like step up your game because now apples in in the business too
[01:15:47.300 --> 01:15:54.100]   So you don't get to just sit back and be the the kings of of this realm because somebody's coming to take your throne, you know
[01:15:54.820 --> 01:15:58.180]   What happens to intel jason is it is it curtains?
[01:15:58.180 --> 01:16:01.300]   I I really do wonder about that
[01:16:01.300 --> 01:16:02.180]   You know
[01:16:02.180 --> 01:16:06.820]   It's not necessarily a fate of complete that you know intel will need to step up its game
[01:16:06.820 --> 01:16:13.140]   We've seen microsoft experimenting with windows on our processors repeatedly they're back there again now
[01:16:13.140 --> 01:16:15.700]   and you know, maybe
[01:16:15.700 --> 01:16:20.660]   It's definitely positive if i was microsoft i'd be looking at this and thinking we i want to do what apple did
[01:16:21.140 --> 01:16:28.020]   Not you know with qua-com let's say something like that like why don't we redefine this and get away from intel because intel isn't doing
[01:16:28.020 --> 01:16:30.740]   You know intel isn't working for us either
[01:16:30.740 --> 01:16:34.900]   So I do think it's really hard. This is you know the lesson that steve jobs
[01:16:34.900 --> 01:16:43.060]   Learned and then put in apples culture from a very early point is don't rely on other people
[01:16:43.060 --> 01:16:48.260]   For your critical business infrastructure and you know intel was a convenient
[01:16:49.220 --> 01:16:56.660]   Tool for apple to get out of the power pc alliance and get computers that were actually running at decent speeds when the power pc alliance was lagging
[01:16:56.660 --> 01:16:59.380]   But you know the iphone because it wasn't a computer
[01:16:59.380 --> 01:17:03.860]   They got to rewrite the rules they ended up developing their own processors for it
[01:17:03.860 --> 01:17:09.140]   And you know they've been thinking all this time, you know, what if we could apply this to the mac?
[01:17:09.140 --> 01:17:12.900]   What if we could get away entirely from being on you know
[01:17:12.900 --> 01:17:20.740]   Because I would wager that a lot of people's frustration with apples release schedule for a lot of their macs the last decade has been because apple
[01:17:20.740 --> 01:17:25.620]   Was waiting for intel you bet intel has had a really bad decade
[01:17:25.620 --> 01:17:30.820]   So this is like the logical I think conclusion of what apple learned from the iphone, which is
[01:17:30.820 --> 01:17:35.860]   You know they built essentially the best chip design group in the world
[01:17:35.860 --> 01:17:41.700]   And why would they not press their advantage and I now suspect that the last two or three years of sort of static
[01:17:42.100 --> 01:17:47.220]   Mac development is because apple's been too busy redesigning their next wave of macs
[01:17:47.220 --> 01:17:49.780]   When they can control all of the parts
[01:17:49.780 --> 01:17:57.620]   You know I swore that before this show I would sit down and watch all six hours of testimony and I just couldn't bring myself to do it
[01:17:57.620 --> 01:18:00.420]   Uh, but i'm sure you all did
[01:18:00.420 --> 01:18:04.340]   Yeah with a fine tooth comb. So what are the takeaways?
[01:18:08.980 --> 01:18:12.820]   I mean, you might take away any money. Go ahead. Sorry. Go ahead. You start you start
[01:18:12.820 --> 01:18:17.220]   No, I was just gonna say my takeaway is that they gathered an extraordinary bit of evidence
[01:18:17.220 --> 01:18:23.380]   So leo if you ran twit and had as little information as the ceo seemed to have about
[01:18:23.380 --> 01:18:26.580]   That
[01:18:26.580 --> 01:18:30.420]   I mean that would if we did that that would be wrong, but I can't promise we didn't do that
[01:18:30.420 --> 01:18:36.180]   What what's happening here? No, they they um it really seemed to be them repeatedly
[01:18:36.820 --> 01:18:41.060]   Uh, this was the pattern the government would be talking on some emails
[01:18:41.060 --> 01:18:44.500]   They'd have them dead to rights on some and I competitive behavior
[01:18:44.500 --> 01:18:50.900]   Something that was just completely indefensible and they'll be like oh gosh. I just don't know
[01:18:50.900 --> 01:18:56.900]   About that. I guess I think what we were trying to say is we're trying to empower users
[01:18:56.900 --> 01:19:04.500]   And they just kept trying to flip it around like um the other part of it that was so stunning is all four of them
[01:19:05.380 --> 01:19:08.420]   Really kept talking about their companies like they're these nimble
[01:19:08.420 --> 01:19:13.540]   Humble upstarts that just may have made a few mistakes and it's like y'all
[01:19:13.540 --> 01:19:19.780]   Y'all just beat the like the market repeatedly because you're all effectively monopolies or do
[01:19:19.780 --> 01:19:28.580]   Oppolies like you know, you're not this nimble like garage run company anymore. You are real entities and I just um
[01:19:28.580 --> 01:19:34.660]   I I I really thought congress did a pretty good job all the grandstanding. Um, you know
[01:19:35.300 --> 01:19:40.900]   Put aside and it's it's the staff as much as anything else. I mean they clearly did a lot of document
[01:19:40.900 --> 01:19:44.340]   Did they do they are they able to use the power of discovery? Can they
[01:19:44.340 --> 01:19:49.220]   subpoena documents is that because they got a lot of internal? Yeah, they released a lot of documents
[01:19:49.220 --> 01:19:53.860]   at the beginning of the hearings that they could discuss a lot of emails and other things that were
[01:19:53.860 --> 01:19:56.660]   I don't know totally now for instance
[01:19:56.660 --> 01:19:58.740]   Uh emails
[01:19:58.740 --> 01:20:03.860]   That said from face that internal and facebook emails that said oh, we're really worried about instagram
[01:20:03.860 --> 01:20:06.340]   It's a real threat right before they bought it
[01:20:06.340 --> 01:20:11.540]   Confirming what everyone knows which is that they bought it as a defensive action
[01:20:11.540 --> 01:20:14.260]   um
[01:20:14.260 --> 01:20:17.860]   Jamie raskin got Bezos to admit amazon is our
[01:20:17.860 --> 01:20:20.900]   priced below market
[01:20:20.900 --> 01:20:25.700]   I mean, I always assumed that amazon probably figured we'll make it up in the
[01:20:25.700 --> 01:20:31.540]   The the transactions it'll go through us as a result same thing with the fire tablets
[01:20:32.260 --> 01:20:36.100]   Um, but I guess it's the problem is from an anti-trust point of view
[01:20:36.100 --> 01:20:39.300]   How do you compete with something that's priced below the cost to make it?
[01:20:39.300 --> 01:20:47.460]   Uh, they they also proved in the hearing the amazon actually ranks its products up in lexa above other
[01:20:47.460 --> 01:20:51.140]   Products are offered again something everybody who's used it knew
[01:20:51.140 --> 01:20:54.740]   Right, it's good to get confirmation. It wasn't just your instinct
[01:20:54.740 --> 01:20:56.740]   Right, um
[01:20:56.740 --> 01:21:01.300]   They accused amazon, uh, actually this was the pop socket guy
[01:21:02.100 --> 01:21:06.020]   Uh, and they brought this up who accused amazon of making
[01:21:06.020 --> 01:21:11.540]   Duplicate products to his until he ponied up two million dollars and add buys and then
[01:21:11.540 --> 01:21:15.060]   Mysteriously the amazon version the pop sockets disappeared
[01:21:15.060 --> 01:21:19.220]   Jeff Bezos said, oh, I don't know I think about that if we did that was wrong
[01:21:19.220 --> 01:21:24.020]   Whoops
[01:21:24.020 --> 01:21:26.900]   I will say one thing that I found astounding
[01:21:26.900 --> 01:21:29.940]   Very interesting about this hearing is that it showed
[01:21:30.820 --> 01:21:35.780]   Strangely that mark zuckerberg has been through a lot of these he understood
[01:21:35.780 --> 01:21:37.060]   He's a little more play it
[01:21:37.060 --> 01:21:42.820]   He understood how to phrase his answers and respond in situations where he wasn't quite sure versus
[01:21:42.820 --> 01:21:48.340]   Say bezos who has never been in this position before floundered a lot. Yeah, I also, you know, I
[01:21:48.340 --> 01:21:55.700]   Maybe this is just me, but i'm looking at the kind of message that's sent by the way
[01:21:55.700 --> 01:21:59.940]   These by the backdrops these executives had the way they were shot
[01:22:00.420 --> 01:22:04.900]   Bezos for instance and rate my skiperam picked this up on twitter
[01:22:04.900 --> 01:22:08.900]   He said get a ring light jeff you've got him on sale right now at amazon.com
[01:22:08.900 --> 01:22:10.900]   jeff was
[01:22:10.900 --> 01:22:12.740]   And I think this was quite intentional
[01:22:12.740 --> 01:22:15.860]   He was so poorly lit that he kind of blended into the background
[01:22:15.860 --> 01:22:21.700]   And I think the intent was really to make him almost disappear, you know, he's managed to avoid these
[01:22:21.700 --> 01:22:23.860]   Testimony up to now
[01:22:23.860 --> 01:22:28.900]   It just kind of the you know and that's in a way that's in a nutshell jeff bezos his way of handling all this
[01:22:29.380 --> 01:22:34.180]   Is he doesn't give interviews. He doesn't testify. He's just sits in the back
[01:22:34.180 --> 01:22:39.380]   But he's definitely the puppet master. There's no question about that. He's he's pulling the strings
[01:22:39.380 --> 01:22:41.700]   There will be so the upshot of this
[01:22:41.700 --> 01:22:47.140]   Uh, this is a big show piece and and yeah members of commerce used it to grandstand
[01:22:47.140 --> 01:22:50.980]   But there was a point and the point is there will be a report
[01:22:50.980 --> 01:22:56.260]   From the subcommittee a final report which will probably not come out before the election
[01:22:57.540 --> 01:22:59.540]   Um six hearings
[01:22:59.540 --> 01:23:02.100]   385 hours of calls and meetings
[01:23:02.100 --> 01:23:06.580]   And most importantly 1.3 million documents from these companies
[01:23:06.580 --> 01:23:11.380]   Lots of lots of legwork done before this testimony
[01:23:11.380 --> 01:23:16.980]   And I think the point of this report is well, here's what we think should happen
[01:23:16.980 --> 01:23:21.860]   Uh, things like I don't know what's on the table. Maybe that facebook should be required to
[01:23:21.860 --> 01:23:23.460]   um
[01:23:23.460 --> 01:23:25.860]   divest instagram and what's app that
[01:23:25.860 --> 01:23:29.220]   I'm almost certain will be one of the things they'll talk about
[01:23:29.220 --> 01:23:32.020]   um
[01:23:32.020 --> 01:23:33.860]   They they did
[01:23:33.860 --> 01:23:42.660]   Talk to sundurpachai ceo of alphabet and by extension google over a google email saying some websites were getting too much
[01:23:42.660 --> 01:23:46.180]   Traffic. You know, did you get that email matt?
[01:23:46.180 --> 01:23:49.380]   I don't recall getting that email
[01:23:49.380 --> 01:23:50.900]   um
[01:23:50.900 --> 01:23:53.060]   it's interesting because like
[01:23:53.060 --> 01:23:57.380]   I was there when the search team was like eight people around a ping pong table and
[01:23:57.380 --> 01:24:03.540]   Uh, I always saw people acting with a lot of integrity and and trying to make sure that the you know, the results were fair
[01:24:03.540 --> 01:24:08.980]   They were non-partisan if somebody typed in x they get information or an answer about x
[01:24:08.980 --> 01:24:13.780]   Um, but I could I haven't seen that email. I'm wondering whether you know
[01:24:13.780 --> 01:24:19.140]   It's also the case that if like eight out of the top 10 results are one site then somebody could send an email that's like oh
[01:24:19.780 --> 01:24:25.460]   This site is dominating the search results in a way that's unfair and then the shorthand might be this site is getting too much traffic
[01:24:25.460 --> 01:24:32.580]   But I've certainly seen where investigators can ask questions about things that to a search engineer you're like, oh
[01:24:32.580 --> 01:24:34.660]   These results are interesting
[01:24:34.660 --> 01:24:37.300]   And then they're like are they interesting because you are
[01:24:37.300 --> 01:24:42.740]   Squashing a competitor and they're like no they're interesting because it's actually got more french results than we would have expected
[01:24:42.740 --> 01:24:46.420]   Given that there are many french queries, you know, that sort of thing. That's what makes it so difficult
[01:24:46.980 --> 01:24:50.900]   Just the the phrase getting too much traffic doesn't it's not a smoking gun
[01:24:50.900 --> 01:24:52.900]   It
[01:24:52.900 --> 01:24:58.660]   Now the the imputation is it's this site was gained more traffic than our in our own sites
[01:24:58.660 --> 01:25:02.900]   But it could absolutely just be a failure of oh the algorithms
[01:25:02.900 --> 01:25:05.700]   putting this result up more than it ought to
[01:25:05.700 --> 01:25:12.020]   Uh, pachai's response was congressman just like other businesses we try to understand trends from data
[01:25:12.020 --> 01:25:15.300]   Which we can see and we can use it to improve our products for users
[01:25:15.300 --> 01:25:17.780]   That was by the way the drum beat from all of them
[01:25:17.780 --> 01:25:20.900]   But especially for some of our prize we want to improve our products for users
[01:25:20.900 --> 01:25:24.180]   I have to say at the beginning when all four gave their statements
[01:25:24.180 --> 01:25:28.980]   I want to stand up and wave the flag. I want to say yeah, God bless them. This is the engine
[01:25:28.980 --> 01:25:34.980]   Of american the american economy. This is what's moving us forward. This is where innovation is happening
[01:25:34.980 --> 01:25:38.980]   That these companies are doing their best to make the best possible product
[01:25:38.980 --> 01:25:42.420]   Uh, as tim cook said, I I guess it's true
[01:25:42.500 --> 01:25:48.100]   We don't dominate in any field that we participate in and we are not even close to dominant
[01:25:48.100 --> 01:25:51.780]   We just try to make the best products for users and I think to some degree
[01:25:51.780 --> 01:25:59.700]   To take the opposite side from you, bergana. That's what these companies do and I don't think they should be punished for doing it. Well
[01:25:59.700 --> 01:26:03.540]   Well, I would actually agree. I thought tim cook
[01:26:03.540 --> 01:26:10.260]   I I think if you wanted to rank who got master blasted in this hearing, I think amazon would be number one
[01:26:10.900 --> 01:26:16.340]   Uh, facebook would be number two. I thought google and uh apple got off relatively unscathed
[01:26:16.340 --> 01:26:23.300]   I did hardly talk to tim actually. Yeah, I I listened to most of the hearing while I was working and uh, you know
[01:26:23.300 --> 01:26:29.140]   The biggest moment with tim cook was him being asked about cancel culture for some asinine reason
[01:26:29.140 --> 01:26:33.780]   Uh, so I I I found apples answers generally
[01:26:33.780 --> 01:26:38.660]   Compeling on this as well as google. So I think I agree with you leon
[01:26:38.740 --> 01:26:43.460]   There'd be a risk for congress to be too aggressive in this because especially now
[01:26:43.460 --> 01:26:48.260]   Uh during covid. We are really reliant on technology companies
[01:26:48.260 --> 01:26:49.700]   Yeah
[01:26:49.700 --> 01:26:54.580]   Uh, is it the case do you think may ospares this is it the case that?
[01:26:54.580 --> 01:27:02.980]   These companies are so big that we don't see the innovative ferment we used to see I heard one of my colleagues say in the early days
[01:27:02.980 --> 01:27:04.660]   We had
[01:27:04.660 --> 01:27:08.420]   We'd be there'd be hundreds of different products from hundreds of different companies
[01:27:08.420 --> 01:27:15.060]   It there was nobody one huge dominant player. We had so much to cover now. It's really we cover
[01:27:15.060 --> 01:27:21.300]   google amazon facebook and apple, you know, um, do you feel like that's true paris
[01:27:21.300 --> 01:27:28.500]   Is that fair? I mean I feel like from a coverage perspective. Yes, just because it is there's so dumb. There are so many
[01:27:28.500 --> 01:27:30.740]   They're so large
[01:27:30.740 --> 01:27:34.500]   each of them are a world in and of themselves essentially and um
[01:27:34.500 --> 01:27:40.020]   There is a lot to cover within each company much less all combined
[01:27:40.020 --> 01:27:43.780]   I mean do I think that translates directly to whether or not
[01:27:43.780 --> 01:27:48.340]   These companies are now please. I it's not my position to say but
[01:27:48.340 --> 01:27:51.380]   I think it's
[01:27:51.380 --> 01:27:53.380]   interesting and perhaps
[01:27:53.380 --> 01:27:54.580]   not
[01:27:54.580 --> 01:27:56.580]   the right framework to
[01:27:57.540 --> 01:28:04.500]   Apply here when you're thinking about like a coverage perspective. Um, I think that a coverage perspective is always going to be focused on
[01:28:04.500 --> 01:28:05.700]   um
[01:28:05.700 --> 01:28:06.980]   like
[01:28:06.980 --> 01:28:12.820]   The biggest players in the room because there just isn't enough energy out there much less funding media or
[01:28:12.820 --> 01:28:16.580]   Even just from users to have your eyes on everything
[01:28:16.580 --> 01:28:20.260]   But I think that also when you have companies that do
[01:28:20.260 --> 01:28:24.020]   get so large and do affect so many people
[01:28:24.740 --> 01:28:28.900]   That that warrants criticism and warrants a careful eye
[01:28:28.900 --> 01:28:36.180]   That's exactly what david jit jilini who's the chair said he said because these companies are so central in our modern life
[01:28:36.180 --> 01:28:38.180]   This was in his opening
[01:28:38.180 --> 01:28:42.660]   Their business practices and decisions have an outsized effect on our economy and democracy
[01:28:42.660 --> 01:28:47.860]   Any single action by any one of these companies can affect hundreds of millions of us in profound and lasting ways?
[01:28:47.860 --> 01:28:51.620]   Absolutely. Nobody nobody denies that. That's why we cover them
[01:28:52.100 --> 01:28:56.740]   We cover because they make they change our lives that not inherently bad
[01:28:56.740 --> 01:28:59.140]   Yeah
[01:28:59.140 --> 01:29:00.820]   What do you think matt? I mean
[01:29:00.820 --> 01:29:05.620]   You have the best perspective on google having having worked there and I would agree with you
[01:29:05.620 --> 01:29:10.740]   Everybody I ever met from google had just like tim cook had the interest in making the best product they could
[01:29:10.740 --> 01:29:20.020]   Yeah, I think that's true. I also think way back, you know the first like ftc investigation like 2011 or whatever
[01:29:20.500 --> 01:29:25.140]   You know the the thing that google would say is we understand that with size comes scrutiny
[01:29:25.140 --> 01:29:30.420]   And I think given the size of all these companies it is perfectly appropriate to scrutinize them
[01:29:30.420 --> 01:29:34.020]   And at the same time it was interesting to see how
[01:29:34.020 --> 01:29:40.180]   If you think about like an earlier zuckerberg hearing the questions were not on point as seen by paris's hat
[01:29:40.180 --> 01:29:46.100]   And and the questions like you could tell a bunch of research happened and for me
[01:29:46.100 --> 01:29:48.660]   One of the most interesting things is
[01:29:48.820 --> 01:29:55.860]   How do you get like the idea of law makers passing laws to regulate technology when they might not
[01:29:55.860 --> 01:30:00.260]   Perfectly understand some of the issues involved is a little bit scary
[01:30:00.260 --> 01:30:05.700]   And so there's some interesting areas. There's this thing called tech congress for example. They've got fellowship
[01:30:05.700 --> 01:30:09.220]   Applications opening for the next three weeks
[01:30:09.220 --> 01:30:17.140]   So they bring in technologists computer scientists engineers and they sit in the offices of like important members of congress
[01:30:17.540 --> 01:30:22.980]   To help make sure that people understand technology and you can ask the right questions or you can get to the issues that matter
[01:30:22.980 --> 01:30:29.220]   And I think getting more technologists talking to dc and vice versa is probably good for both worlds
[01:30:29.220 --> 01:30:33.380]   One I mean jitulini was kind of a bulldog
[01:30:33.380 --> 01:30:38.980]   And he bared down on this google issue and this is the one I really want to ask you about matt
[01:30:38.980 --> 01:30:41.700]   the the the
[01:30:41.700 --> 01:30:46.660]   Claim is that google favors his own content over other sites content
[01:30:47.380 --> 01:30:52.820]   Uh, jitulini put it in I think a very nasty way. So why does google steal content from honest businesses?
[01:30:52.820 --> 01:30:58.980]   And he was pointing at Yelp, which maybe not the most honest business i've ever heard of
[01:30:58.980 --> 01:31:05.940]   Um, I think honest business is an oxymoron generally, but they're all trying to and Yelp, you know
[01:31:05.940 --> 01:31:12.660]   I mean let's face it a lot of this scrutiny comes from google competitors who are unhappy with google's success
[01:31:13.700 --> 01:31:19.140]   And and whether in the eu or here and yelps a good example go hey guys you really ought to look at this
[01:31:19.140 --> 01:31:23.780]   This is something terrible, but google but it is the case that when you do a google search
[01:31:23.780 --> 01:31:29.540]   Uh and pachai said this is particularly in commerce when you're buying when you're looking to buy a product
[01:31:29.540 --> 01:31:34.660]   That google's going to surface shopping information. There's a lot of knowledge cards now
[01:31:34.660 --> 01:31:40.580]   Used to be google search results. We just search results now. There's the knowledge card and there's a lot more at stuff
[01:31:40.820 --> 01:31:44.500]   And a lot of it does have youtube videos youtube, you know google shopping
[01:31:44.500 --> 01:31:47.140]   um
[01:31:47.140 --> 01:31:54.340]   Google excuses. We're just giving we're trying to give people the information they're looking for we're trying to answer their question
[01:31:54.340 --> 01:31:56.260]   Right, man
[01:31:56.260 --> 01:32:03.620]   Yeah, that's absolutely right and I think the people in the search team still believe that they've internalized that and uh,
[01:32:03.620 --> 01:32:05.620]   I also think there's there's
[01:32:05.620 --> 01:32:10.420]   You know tension which is well deserved because as google moves up the value chain of
[01:32:10.500 --> 01:32:17.060]   Delivering better and better answers, you know, there are some sites, you know from my old world with seo hat on where
[01:32:17.060 --> 01:32:20.580]   You know, uh people would feel like you're taking a snippet from my site
[01:32:20.580 --> 01:32:26.500]   And that's the thing that people really want to know like how high is the celebrity is so they never go to the site because they got the information
[01:32:26.500 --> 01:32:29.060]   That's a legit complaint
[01:32:29.060 --> 01:32:33.300]   It's a legit complaint and it's a valid concern on both sides like well, okay
[01:32:33.300 --> 01:32:38.820]   If you really all you needed to know was that's you know how high top cruise was right then, you know
[01:32:39.380 --> 01:32:43.300]   Maybe they're not gonna stay on your side high or how tall how tall sorry
[01:32:43.300 --> 01:32:53.220]   But then the flip side is you know the other day I was invoking my google device and I was like, you know
[01:32:53.220 --> 01:32:58.260]   Tell me how to spell loquacious and it just spells it right out. It doesn't point me to another website
[01:32:58.260 --> 01:33:02.100]   So, but that's what you want as the user. Yeah, that's what you want
[01:33:02.100 --> 01:33:05.140]   Yeah, so I I do have to say
[01:33:05.860 --> 01:33:12.260]   As someone that watched most of this hearing we're not just talking about things that that show up in google site results
[01:33:12.260 --> 01:33:14.900]   Like some of the most explosive moments we're talking about
[01:33:14.900 --> 01:33:21.860]   For google's own uh lyrics that show up on android and they had one particular company that put that out there
[01:33:21.860 --> 01:33:24.740]   They actually put fake records in their lyrics
[01:33:24.740 --> 01:33:31.620]   And you know, it talks about that one and half. Yeah, yeah, exactly google was caught using that so this isn't
[01:33:32.900 --> 01:33:39.220]   Well, but google okay, so this is more complicated because google said well we were we didn't scrape it from rap genius
[01:33:39.220 --> 01:33:42.420]   We hired a company that scraped it from rap genius
[01:33:42.420 --> 01:33:47.940]   So it's not our fault is that companies fault and I think
[01:33:47.940 --> 01:33:53.620]   At least in google's defense they stopped doing that but they did get caught red handed sure
[01:33:53.620 --> 01:33:59.620]   I I'm just saying I think it's um, it's a wider pattern of behavior that I think could be
[01:33:59.940 --> 01:34:05.300]   construed as anti-competitive and in my opinion if you're using a third-party person and they are
[01:34:05.300 --> 01:34:07.860]   doing something that uh
[01:34:07.860 --> 01:34:15.460]   Blatened I do think it I think your company should face sanctions in that case. So that's my opinion the problem is just so hard to figure out
[01:34:15.460 --> 01:34:19.460]   I mean, I think it's a good defense. Well, we're just trying to give people the answer that they expect
[01:34:19.460 --> 01:34:28.100]   Another um thing that came up with the hearing which is based on a article written by a couple of my colleagues the information is
[01:34:29.140 --> 01:34:31.940]   kind of the accusations that google um
[01:34:31.940 --> 01:34:40.580]   Has used its android platform and the amount of information it can kind of collect on how users using android use apps in order to
[01:34:40.580 --> 01:34:46.740]   Do research for its own applications? I think the situation that they
[01:34:46.740 --> 01:34:54.260]   My colleagues discussed in their article was in preparation for launching google's own possible like tiktok competitor
[01:34:54.660 --> 01:35:00.900]   They pulled data from android about how people use tiktok and android devices, which seems
[01:35:00.900 --> 01:35:04.020]   kind of a conflict of interest there
[01:35:04.020 --> 01:35:06.820]   It's a jerky move if true, so
[01:35:06.820 --> 01:35:14.260]   Yeah, but in amazon's accused of using retail data to figure out what products it should make
[01:35:14.260 --> 01:35:20.100]   Um, but I think every business in the world would do that does that right? We're trying to figure
[01:35:20.100 --> 01:35:23.300]   I guess amazon has a unique access to data
[01:35:24.340 --> 01:35:27.380]   That it wouldn't normally have is that why it's wrong?
[01:35:27.380 --> 01:35:32.900]   I mean part of the issue is that if you listen to the complaints of
[01:35:32.900 --> 01:35:37.700]   Small like first party sellers or third party sellers on amazon. They say oh
[01:35:37.700 --> 01:35:40.420]   I have been making
[01:35:40.420 --> 01:35:46.180]   This unicorn themed hairbrush for 10 years. Everybody loves my unicorn hairbrush
[01:35:46.180 --> 01:35:51.220]   It's been doing so well then all of a sudden I see amazon brand unicorn hairbrush
[01:35:52.260 --> 01:35:57.940]   Appears top of the search results is the amazon choice and nobody buys my unicorn hairbrush anymore
[01:35:57.940 --> 01:35:59.940]   That's a good complaint in situations like that
[01:35:59.940 --> 01:36:04.100]   It seems uh, I don't know to be a fairly concerning
[01:36:04.100 --> 01:36:11.460]   Practice of true. This is the same problem I have with google owning youtube and amazon selling stuff
[01:36:11.460 --> 01:36:14.180]   Is it mixes the two things?
[01:36:14.180 --> 01:36:17.220]   Together if google were just a search engine
[01:36:17.700 --> 01:36:22.020]   It wouldn't be so much of a problem except that it controls one of the the number one
[01:36:22.020 --> 01:36:24.740]   Deliver of video content
[01:36:24.740 --> 01:36:27.540]   So that kind of muddles the matter amazon
[01:36:27.540 --> 01:36:29.380]   Uh
[01:36:29.380 --> 01:36:33.060]   If it's going to do what it's do shouldn't also be in the business of making these products
[01:36:33.060 --> 01:36:37.620]   Because they have an unusual amount of information. I mean face it. Uh, you know, I
[01:36:37.620 --> 01:36:40.980]   I bought this hygiene hand on kickstarter
[01:36:40.980 --> 01:36:43.860]   Which which shows that i'm an idiot
[01:36:44.260 --> 01:36:48.340]   Because I paid too much. Oh, I've gotten so many instagram ads for that thing
[01:36:48.340 --> 01:36:51.780]   But the point is the minute that this went on kickstarter
[01:36:51.780 --> 01:36:57.300]   800 chinese companies made an exact clone of it and sold it for a tenth the price
[01:36:57.300 --> 01:37:01.540]   Yeah, so all my friends have cheap ones. I have the fancy one
[01:37:01.540 --> 01:37:06.340]   It's just a piece of metal that you poke stuff with it's not it shouldn't be expensive
[01:37:06.340 --> 01:37:11.380]   But but the point is they didn't need amazon data to do that that happens all the time
[01:37:12.100 --> 01:37:14.100]   Yeah, um, you know, I bought
[01:37:14.100 --> 01:37:21.540]   Well, I okay, don't judge me, but I bought led light up eyelashes
[01:37:21.540 --> 01:37:26.900]   Okay, please wake up. What's the context for this first? Yeah. Yeah
[01:37:26.900 --> 01:37:31.540]   What was the role for that? It was F real. Yeah, see yeah, nad understands
[01:37:31.540 --> 01:37:35.140]   It was called it was called the I think it was called the F flash
[01:37:35.140 --> 01:37:37.780]   interactive led
[01:37:37.780 --> 01:37:40.180]   eyelash
[01:37:40.740 --> 01:37:42.740]   Recording
[01:37:42.740 --> 01:37:49.540]   Yeah, no, well, I ordered them and I this was another kickstarter. I have a problem with kickstarter as soon as it went on kickstarter
[01:37:49.540 --> 01:37:57.700]   Um, this poor guy vietnamese guy got undercut by a hundred chinese companies selling. I mean I said well, we can do that
[01:37:57.700 --> 01:37:59.860]   What's there's nothing special about that
[01:37:59.860 --> 01:38:06.100]   And so as a result, uh, I didn't get my F lashes for months
[01:38:06.100 --> 01:38:09.380]   But everybody else and at the party had them
[01:38:10.260 --> 01:38:12.260]   So I feel
[01:38:12.260 --> 01:38:20.020]   Lashes feel dark and unilluminated. Yeah, wow. I didn't even wear them. I thought screw this
[01:38:20.020 --> 01:38:26.260]   Oh, you know, it's not special anymore. I tell you you got everything you need for your own tick-tock channel
[01:38:26.260 --> 01:38:30.260]   You're ready
[01:38:30.260 --> 01:38:35.380]   Yeah, you should be just posting content of you unboxing all of your christ
[01:38:35.380 --> 01:38:39.700]   Oh my god three months after it's been on the market for half the price
[01:38:39.700 --> 01:38:42.900]   And some of your black hawk helicopter. Yeah. Oh
[01:38:42.900 --> 01:38:48.580]   Man, if I bought that I probably would be a ticktock star for a moment or two. That's that'd be good
[01:38:48.580 --> 01:38:54.020]   Let's do that. I can't hear point. I I really do it's complicated
[01:38:54.020 --> 01:38:59.940]   It is complicated and in this particular case in my husband does patent law and I would
[01:38:59.940 --> 01:39:03.540]   So we're coming to me with this particular business plan. I would say
[01:39:04.340 --> 01:39:10.180]   What you have in front of you is not novel in a way that it can be patented according to our laws
[01:39:10.180 --> 01:39:13.380]   And you should understand that this is a business threat
[01:39:13.380 --> 01:39:19.380]   That's reasonable. I do think that's a slightly different situation than someone
[01:39:19.380 --> 01:39:21.620]   Then a company
[01:39:21.620 --> 01:39:28.340]   Abusing their data to undercut competitors and threaten other companies which is what came out in this hearing
[01:39:28.420 --> 01:39:34.580]   So I think I really agree with you matt the the way forward is these are big companies
[01:39:34.580 --> 01:39:40.180]   They deserve scrutiny and I think you can never say often enough. You know who wasn't at this hearing today
[01:39:40.180 --> 01:39:45.140]   It's microsoft. We brought that case against them in the 90s and they have
[01:39:45.140 --> 01:39:52.740]   Been a pretty ethical company generally speaking in the two decades since three decades now. I guess three two and so you
[01:39:52.740 --> 01:39:55.060]   You would submit that the doj
[01:39:55.060 --> 01:39:59.380]   prosecution of microsoft in the 90s was successful in that regard
[01:39:59.380 --> 01:40:04.980]   What I've heard from my friends that work at microsoft over and over and over again
[01:40:04.980 --> 01:40:11.780]   Is it that fundamentally changed the culture interesting and that there was more of an anything goes approach before then
[01:40:11.780 --> 01:40:16.420]   And then they finally had a conversation where it had to go through legal
[01:40:16.420 --> 01:40:19.940]   They had to have discussions if those going to open them up to liability. So
[01:40:19.940 --> 01:40:24.100]   My opinion is this is all checks and balances, right?
[01:40:24.820 --> 01:40:31.140]   If the not talking about trump but a generic president were to do something that was over the line congress checks them
[01:40:31.140 --> 01:40:36.420]   That doesn't necessarily mean the presidency itself is corrupt. It's just a system meant to check each other
[01:40:36.420 --> 01:40:41.700]   I I think until we see stronger anti-trust actions against
[01:40:41.700 --> 01:40:48.580]   Against tech companies. I think they're going to feel free to just keep pushing the line harder and harder
[01:40:48.580 --> 01:40:51.700]   So I strongly support this line of investigation
[01:40:52.580 --> 01:40:58.420]   There were two well three big four maybe a five there were a lot of big stories in 2020
[01:40:58.420 --> 01:41:05.380]   Uh, we just cuddled a couple covered a couple which is uh apple's move to its own chips and and uh, of course
[01:41:05.380 --> 01:41:11.220]   Washington dcs investigations of the tech giants that's a story that won't end for some time
[01:41:11.220 --> 01:41:16.020]   Part of that story and it's a weird one is the president
[01:41:16.020 --> 01:41:18.660]   and tick tock
[01:41:18.660 --> 01:41:20.020]   This is one
[01:41:20.020 --> 01:41:22.260]   I don't know if we'll ever see the end of this watch
[01:41:22.260 --> 01:41:26.500]   So the president has wanted to ban a tick tock
[01:41:26.500 --> 01:41:30.180]   Uh, he couldn't figure out a way to do it
[01:41:30.180 --> 01:41:35.460]   But I think he's might have found a way with executive order. He's going to prohibit
[01:41:35.460 --> 01:41:43.220]   Americans from having any transactions with the parent company bite dance starting september 20th
[01:41:43.220 --> 01:41:47.300]   That means uh tick tock can't pay influencers
[01:41:47.700 --> 01:41:52.340]   Advertisers can't buy ads tick tock's response to that is we will help
[01:41:52.340 --> 01:42:00.580]   Influencers move to another platform. We will pay it will make sure that everybody uh, we owe money to gets paid before september 20th
[01:42:00.580 --> 01:42:03.380]   the plan b
[01:42:03.380 --> 01:42:06.820]   And it's very unclear because the president goes back and forth on this
[01:42:06.820 --> 01:42:10.260]   Is to have some american company acquire
[01:42:10.260 --> 01:42:16.260]   At least the american operations of tick tock microsoft has been negotiating to buy the australian american
[01:42:16.660 --> 01:42:19.940]   Canadian and I think uk rights to tick tock
[01:42:19.940 --> 01:42:24.180]   They have until the 15th rewrite it and dot net and that'd be effectively killing it
[01:42:24.180 --> 01:42:30.580]   Give it a right bill gate has said it's a poison bill bill. He did say that I saw that interview. Yeah, yeah
[01:42:30.580 --> 01:42:35.300]   Really good interview with bill gates by the way. I highly recommend that uh, where was that?
[01:42:35.300 --> 01:42:39.700]   I just saw it right at this morning. Uh was with steve levi was it wired?
[01:42:39.700 --> 01:42:40.580]   Yeah
[01:42:40.580 --> 01:42:44.420]   Yeah, uh, steve also have to remember that the way that the executive order was written
[01:42:45.140 --> 01:42:50.660]   He knows he can't you can't block it and he doesn't even have the knowledge to understand how that would even be possible
[01:42:50.660 --> 01:42:57.380]   So he's stopping financial transactions. The problem is the companies that he's trying to stop the financial transactions with own
[01:42:57.380 --> 01:43:02.820]   Like 60 percent of the gaming landscape. Yeah, or they have interest in 60
[01:43:02.820 --> 01:43:08.020]   We chat and 10 cent and the other problem, uh, is he had to declare a national emergency
[01:43:08.020 --> 01:43:10.980]   So apparently tick tock is now a national emergency
[01:43:11.860 --> 01:43:16.820]   Uh, not co vid 19 not russian efforts to influence the election
[01:43:16.820 --> 01:43:19.540]   Uh, sometimes I feel like maybe this is
[01:43:19.540 --> 01:43:26.500]   I feel like there's a larger agenda from the white house. It has to do with a trade war. It has to do pay with pay no attention to russia
[01:43:26.500 --> 01:43:33.780]   No, i'm not celebrating the chinese government. Uh, they're repressive what they've done. The weegers is shocking and disappointing and
[01:43:33.780 --> 01:43:36.820]   You know, you know, horrible
[01:43:37.300 --> 01:43:41.620]   Um, and and there was some evidence that maybe tick tock was doing something to
[01:43:41.620 --> 01:43:48.420]   Uh, keep black creators down or to keep overweight people. Although I see plenty of overweight people in tick tock now
[01:43:48.420 --> 01:43:50.420]   So they clearly fixed that algorithm
[01:43:50.420 --> 01:43:54.900]   Um, I I just don't see tick tock as that big of a threat
[01:43:54.900 --> 01:43:56.820]   And I
[01:43:56.820 --> 01:44:00.740]   I'm a little disappointed for the creators who found this incredible medium to make something
[01:44:00.740 --> 01:44:02.900]   Really amazing
[01:44:02.900 --> 01:44:09.460]   And I often even feel like maybe the president doesn't like the fact that he's being made fun of on tick tock and that tick tockers bought
[01:44:09.460 --> 01:44:11.460]   Are registered for his tulsa
[01:44:11.460 --> 01:44:12.820]   Uh
[01:44:12.820 --> 01:44:16.260]   Campaign rally didn't show up and it seems to be personal
[01:44:16.260 --> 01:44:22.740]   He says but it totally makes sense because I mean if you ban tick tock those people will totally not go anywhere else
[01:44:22.740 --> 01:44:25.060]   I mean they'll just
[01:44:25.060 --> 01:44:28.740]   Twitter closed vine and that became a lot of the huge youtubers now
[01:44:29.380 --> 01:44:33.140]   Well, by the way, that's the other chilling story that twitter is trying to get tick tock
[01:44:33.140 --> 01:44:36.740]   Which that's it's the best thing to do if you want to kill tick tock. Just give it to twitter
[01:44:36.740 --> 01:44:40.260]   Uh
[01:44:40.260 --> 01:44:42.980]   I don't yeah, good thing twitter never had anything like tick
[01:44:42.980 --> 01:44:45.060]   Uh, yeah, yeah
[01:44:45.060 --> 01:44:49.700]   Actually twitter is not doesn't have nearly the money that it would take to buy tick tock
[01:44:49.700 --> 01:44:54.580]   It tick tock is going to be well over 30 billion dollars if it if it is sold to uh, microsoft
[01:44:55.140 --> 01:45:00.500]   And the whole thing is interesting like you could ban tick tock the same way that the great firewall bans twitter and facebook
[01:45:00.500 --> 01:45:04.660]   Just by preventing the app from being downloaded and firewalling off the servers
[01:45:04.660 --> 01:45:07.060]   But how do you like
[01:45:07.060 --> 01:45:11.540]   Separate it out so that I am i'm on canadian and american tick tock you're on uk tick tock
[01:45:11.540 --> 01:45:15.460]   Can we not see each other anymore? Can we but the data is stored somewhere else?
[01:45:15.460 --> 01:45:20.420]   It's just time there's so many questions that people who don't have no idea how software and services work
[01:45:20.820 --> 01:45:24.900]   Seem to want to manipulate people that accuse me of saying oh you're soft on china
[01:45:24.900 --> 01:45:27.860]   You're giving it past and apparently there were big fights in the white house over that as well
[01:45:27.860 --> 01:45:30.820]   But I just don't see tick tock as a threat. There are some
[01:45:30.820 --> 01:45:36.660]   Serious threats that are being completely ignored from russia on facebook and twitter that are just being
[01:45:36.660 --> 01:45:44.740]   Downplayed and ignored while while tick tock seems to be the poster child for problems and incidentally it won't stop with tick tock
[01:45:44.740 --> 01:45:46.980]   This is really about
[01:45:46.980 --> 01:45:48.980]   Chinese products and chinese apps
[01:45:49.700 --> 01:45:51.940]   And that is really challenging
[01:45:51.940 --> 01:45:59.620]   It's about privacy if you are really concerned about tick tock being able to track what u.s citizens are doing
[01:45:59.620 --> 01:46:05.780]   It's not just tick tock. It's facebook. It's twitter. It's google. It's everybody who has a cloud presence
[01:46:05.780 --> 01:46:12.740]   Well, similarly if you're worried about that similarly if you're worried about how it could be used by foreign actors to influence us
[01:46:12.740 --> 01:46:15.380]   You're not stopping it on facebook and twitter
[01:46:15.460 --> 01:46:21.860]   It's not the ownership of the company that matters anybody can use tick tock facebook or twitter to do that
[01:46:21.860 --> 01:46:24.740]   You just have to carry in the algorithm
[01:46:24.740 --> 01:46:30.180]   Yeah, but that's that whole data repatriation thing we were talking about a while ago when countries like china and france
[01:46:30.180 --> 01:46:35.060]   Started saying they wanted the data for their citizens stored on servers that were located within those countries
[01:46:35.060 --> 01:46:41.220]   I think australia and a couple other countries because ironically they didn't trust necessarily chinese or us servers
[01:46:41.220 --> 01:46:43.460]   Because they didn't feel like they had their best
[01:46:43.460 --> 01:46:45.620]   You know everything good faisal warrants and things like that
[01:46:45.620 --> 01:46:48.580]   They didn't feel like they had the best interest of their citizens in mind
[01:46:48.580 --> 01:46:51.460]   And I think we're still gonna see an upswell of data repatriation laws
[01:46:51.460 --> 01:46:53.700]   globally
[01:46:53.700 --> 01:46:56.180]   It goes beyond that and that is a country
[01:46:56.180 --> 01:47:01.140]   Can ask for the data on servers that are contained on servers in their country
[01:47:01.140 --> 01:47:07.540]   In their in their territory tick tock stores american data in america and backs it up in singapore
[01:47:07.540 --> 01:47:09.940]   According to tik tock. Yep
[01:47:10.180 --> 01:47:15.860]   That's all right. Maybe canadian data in the us like it's very expensive to have an entire data center in every single country. Yeah, yeah
[01:47:15.860 --> 01:47:22.020]   Uh, and I also worry that at some point you're going to see the chinese loose their patience
[01:47:22.020 --> 01:47:26.820]   And there are quite a few american companies that do a lot of business in china including
[01:47:26.820 --> 01:47:29.380]   apple
[01:47:29.380 --> 01:47:36.580]   Uh apple is hard because like the hardware is such an important part of the economy of southern china like they couldn't turn that off
[01:47:36.740 --> 01:47:41.140]   Hardware would devastate send gen and and all the companies and all the workers there
[01:47:41.140 --> 01:47:44.180]   But apple services could be an easy target
[01:47:44.180 --> 01:47:46.740]   Um, and it is interesting because
[01:47:46.740 --> 01:47:52.900]   Right now some people see a disparity like china will not accept anyone saying anything about chinese policy
[01:47:52.900 --> 01:47:57.460]   Like you saw when the when the nba commented about hong kong or other people they were furious
[01:47:57.460 --> 01:48:03.940]   But it it goes one way they don't mind commenting on at all on how the us or or canada or other countries
[01:48:04.260 --> 01:48:10.820]   And the same way they get upset if chinese services like walleye or something are not allowed access into western markets
[01:48:10.820 --> 01:48:16.340]   But they have no qualms about banning twitter and facebook and all the services in china
[01:48:16.340 --> 01:48:21.940]   And I think it's uh, I forget who said it might have been ben tomsen because he's he lives in taiwan is really smart about this
[01:48:21.940 --> 01:48:24.180]   That we insist on viewing china
[01:48:24.180 --> 01:48:29.220]   From an american point of view when we very seldom take the opportunity to look at america from a chinese point of view
[01:48:29.220 --> 01:48:30.340]   Right
[01:48:30.340 --> 01:48:34.900]   Well, this is where it's heading in five years. This is the fragmentation of the internet
[01:48:34.900 --> 01:48:39.700]   This is what we've been talking about at twit for the last decade, which is you've got the great firewall of china
[01:48:39.700 --> 01:48:42.820]   They're doing that in russia. They're doing that inside of your abia. They're doing that in venezuela
[01:48:42.820 --> 01:48:48.180]   We now have a administration that wants to do the same to the united states. Do we not want to have a
[01:48:48.180 --> 01:48:52.900]   I don't think it's right. I don't I think we condemn those countries for doing that
[01:48:52.900 --> 01:48:58.660]   It's bad for them and it's bad for the world. Do we want to have a great firewall of america
[01:48:59.700 --> 01:49:03.380]   That's where we're headed actually the reason we're here armed
[01:49:03.380 --> 01:49:06.340]   Whoa
[01:49:06.340 --> 01:49:11.940]   I didn't know the gun was loaded the reason we're here armed a lot of americans
[01:49:11.940 --> 01:49:20.500]   Is uh, whoa is because uh, you can't play fortnite on ios anymore
[01:49:20.500 --> 01:49:25.540]   Orandrid, I get it's hard to hit the camera. Let me just see if I can really
[01:49:27.620 --> 01:49:29.620]   Yeah, we'll get there uh
[01:49:29.620 --> 01:49:38.820]   Fortnite clearly was itching for a fight
[01:49:38.820 --> 01:49:42.020]   and decided to
[01:49:42.020 --> 01:49:44.260]   Take this time
[01:49:44.260 --> 01:49:49.780]   To modify the in-app purchases on its app both on ios and android
[01:49:49.780 --> 01:49:52.740]   in order to get
[01:49:52.740 --> 01:49:54.740]   pulled down on both
[01:49:55.460 --> 01:50:01.940]   At which point they released a video that oddly they had just ready to hand
[01:50:01.940 --> 01:50:04.900]   Called
[01:50:04.900 --> 01:50:06.900]   1984 night
[01:50:06.900 --> 01:50:09.220]   That may remind you a little bit of a video
[01:50:09.220 --> 01:50:12.580]   That we saw in 1984
[01:50:12.580 --> 01:50:21.540]   People sitting watching a giant screen a young woman with well, it's not a sledgehammer actually it's um, a unicorn hobby horse
[01:50:22.740 --> 01:50:29.220]   And she's running away from the police she arrives and tosses it through the screen
[01:50:29.220 --> 01:50:32.900]   Which smashes
[01:50:32.900 --> 01:50:36.500]   And then epic games has defied
[01:50:36.500 --> 01:50:42.580]   The app store monopoly in retaliation apple is blocking fortnite from one billion devices
[01:50:42.580 --> 01:50:44.980]   Join the fight to stop 2020
[01:50:44.980 --> 01:50:47.620]   From being
[01:50:48.020 --> 01:50:53.940]   Hashtag free fortnite. They were ready. They also went to court saw a an injunction
[01:50:53.940 --> 01:50:56.020]   Uh
[01:50:56.020 --> 01:50:59.060]   They did the same thing to google. They didn't have a video ready for google
[01:50:59.060 --> 01:51:01.540]   I know I don't know maybe they thought google wouldn't pay its attention
[01:51:01.540 --> 01:51:09.300]   You may remember that tim swine of epic didn't put fortnite on the google play store at first saying you should sideload it because we don't want to pay the 30
[01:51:09.300 --> 01:51:11.700]   Eventually they gave in
[01:51:11.700 --> 01:51:14.260]   um mike is their
[01:51:14.260 --> 01:51:16.100]   legal merit
[01:51:16.100 --> 01:51:20.420]   In what epic is doing will they prevail in court or can they?
[01:51:20.420 --> 01:51:25.460]   Uh, it's a big hill to climb
[01:51:25.460 --> 01:51:29.540]   Uh, that doesn't mean they you know that they won't win they might
[01:51:29.540 --> 01:51:34.500]   Uh, but if I were taking odds on whether or not epic would prevail. I would say
[01:51:34.500 --> 01:51:40.260]   They are unlikely to prevail though. I was impressed. Not only did they have that 1984 video
[01:51:40.260 --> 01:51:45.460]   They actually referenced 1984 in the complaint so that they're marketing legal team
[01:51:45.700 --> 01:51:51.860]   They don't have a 60 page complaint. I don't think they wrote that overnight. No, no, no
[01:51:51.860 --> 01:51:56.100]   They had but it's impressive not only did they have it ready but that they had worked out with the marketing
[01:51:56.100 --> 01:52:02.820]   Yes, this whole framing well, wait, but that's not though. I think that's part of in in a way that that I think if i'm the judge
[01:52:02.820 --> 01:52:06.900]   That's going to taint this a little bit because it's so clear
[01:52:06.900 --> 01:52:12.100]   That they kind of set this whole thing up that they yeah prepared for months
[01:52:12.100 --> 01:52:14.500]   for this moment
[01:52:14.500 --> 01:52:16.500]   and I mean part of the the
[01:52:16.500 --> 01:52:21.780]   The thing that's interesting about it, I guess is that you know if you look at it from apple's perspective
[01:52:21.780 --> 01:52:28.020]   They were going to be in trouble no matter which decision they made right if they sort of let fortnight get away with this
[01:52:28.020 --> 01:52:31.060]   Then everybody else would be complaining that oh, you know
[01:52:31.060 --> 01:52:35.780]   They're giving sort of special treatment to fortnight and then of course when they say well fortnight is violating the rule
[01:52:35.780 --> 01:52:40.340]   So therefore we're gonna we're gonna hold them from the store then they have all these other issues
[01:52:40.340 --> 01:52:43.860]   So no matter which way it was going to go like apple
[01:52:44.420 --> 01:52:50.420]   You know didn't have any good choices and I guess google was picking sides and decided they were gonna
[01:52:50.420 --> 01:52:54.020]   Realizing that if apple loses they're going to be in trouble too. Yeah
[01:52:54.020 --> 01:52:56.740]   apple of course is already
[01:52:56.740 --> 01:52:58.580]   under the gun
[01:52:58.580 --> 01:53:00.580]   In the eu over
[01:53:00.580 --> 01:53:02.980]   App store monopoly
[01:53:02.980 --> 01:53:08.420]   In the united states, tim cook was brought up in front of congress along with three other executives as you know a couple of weeks ago
[01:53:08.420 --> 01:53:13.060]   And that was you know one of the issues that congress was interested in
[01:53:13.460 --> 01:53:15.460]   the antitrust subcommittee
[01:53:15.460 --> 01:53:22.980]   Will have a report probably not till the end of the year early next year about this but there's some concern the ftc is looking into it
[01:53:22.980 --> 01:53:25.540]   um that maybe apple is
[01:53:25.540 --> 01:53:30.420]   Uh monopolistic on the on the other hand and i'll give this argument so you guys don't have to
[01:53:30.420 --> 01:53:35.780]   uh a lot of uh people i know say hey apple it's as if apple built
[01:53:35.780 --> 01:53:38.260]   A great mall
[01:53:38.260 --> 01:53:42.180]   And forever 21 moved in and said well, but we don't want to pay you any rent
[01:53:42.180 --> 01:53:44.180]   We just want to be in your mall
[01:53:44.180 --> 01:53:47.460]   They're they're they're freeloading epics freeloading
[01:53:47.460 --> 01:53:53.060]   On what apple has built with its platform and its store. Do you agree? Amy? Is that seem reasonable?
[01:53:53.060 --> 01:53:58.180]   Yeah, so this is there's a there's a a couple of things happening here one
[01:53:58.180 --> 01:54:01.780]   um, we don't have a clear definition for
[01:54:01.780 --> 01:54:05.540]   What the future of distribution would look like so
[01:54:05.540 --> 01:54:08.260]   What's interesting about
[01:54:08.260 --> 01:54:12.180]   I think it's interesting that epic is trying to initiate an antitrust battle
[01:54:12.180 --> 01:54:17.380]   Because the the the hearing that happened a week ago or two weeks ago
[01:54:17.380 --> 01:54:19.220]   um
[01:54:19.220 --> 01:54:22.900]   reflects lawmakers sort of scrambling to
[01:54:22.900 --> 01:54:28.820]   First of all group together companies that really are doing disparate things and second of all using
[01:54:28.820 --> 01:54:33.140]   Policy that was written in 1890. So the Sherman act has written
[01:54:33.140 --> 01:54:35.620]   Didn't know about app stores
[01:54:36.100 --> 01:54:39.140]   Right, but this is important because there's very little
[01:54:39.140 --> 01:54:44.260]   Substantive analogy to make about the means for distribution
[01:54:44.260 --> 01:54:51.380]   In a digital setting and the railroad system. Um, so that being said
[01:54:51.380 --> 01:54:59.540]   This is an interesting this could be an interesting and possible possibly the only way to really crack
[01:54:59.540 --> 01:55:05.380]   Um crack through and that's because this is a limited circumstance. So apple charging 30
[01:55:05.380 --> 01:55:12.340]   Percent if you look at other industries that percentage of rev share is higher than then what you would see elsewhere
[01:55:12.340 --> 01:55:14.820]   It's not though higher than
[01:55:14.820 --> 01:55:19.220]   On the consoles sony microsoft and nintendo
[01:55:19.220 --> 01:55:21.060]   Charges the same
[01:55:21.060 --> 01:55:26.260]   30 fee and have the same control this all dates back to the days when a tarry nintendo
[01:55:26.260 --> 01:55:33.620]   Were swamped by crappy games and they learned very early on. We got to keep type control over what's on our
[01:55:34.180 --> 01:55:37.620]   Console fortnight doesn't seem up doesn't seem to mind that 30
[01:55:37.620 --> 01:55:40.500]   No, it's the it's the data on the other end
[01:55:40.500 --> 01:55:44.820]   So the key difference here is that when you've got a console game with with heavy drm protections
[01:55:44.820 --> 01:55:52.420]   You know, you're talking about a limited you're talking about limited use case now with a game being on a different type of device
[01:55:52.420 --> 01:55:54.340]   um one that
[01:55:54.340 --> 01:55:58.420]   Hinches on the play store and and you know and apple store
[01:55:58.420 --> 01:56:03.300]   There's a wealth of other data. Um there and so I think if they were
[01:56:04.260 --> 01:56:08.420]   It depends it really depends if they try to define antitrust very narrowly
[01:56:08.420 --> 01:56:12.900]   I think they have a shot. I think it could be more compelling for them to talk about
[01:56:12.900 --> 01:56:14.900]   the future of
[01:56:14.900 --> 01:56:17.300]   All of this data that's being generated
[01:56:17.300 --> 01:56:22.340]   um and the fact that that that in and of itself is also, you know, um
[01:56:22.340 --> 01:56:26.260]   But that has value and they can't easily act
[01:56:26.260 --> 01:56:28.020]   Those data
[01:56:28.020 --> 01:56:30.020]   In addition to having to to pay
[01:56:30.020 --> 01:56:36.580]   Feed the fees and you can't you know, there is no other way to play fortnight. You either have to jailbreak and I guess somehow
[01:56:36.580 --> 01:56:40.820]   That's true on google. You could sideload, but there's nothing you can do on apple
[01:56:40.820 --> 01:56:47.460]   So I think I think google had I don't think I was as strong of a case against google, but the reality is that google
[01:56:47.460 --> 01:56:53.860]   Um, you know facebook amazon and apple are all facing some flavor of antitrust and the blanket
[01:56:54.820 --> 01:57:01.300]   Application we already know doesn't apply so what's interesting here is epic could force the hand of apple and start to
[01:57:01.300 --> 01:57:03.860]   Change parts of the industry
[01:57:03.860 --> 01:57:10.100]   What is the so apple's response to this by the way, let me let me paraphrase it is
[01:57:10.100 --> 01:57:13.620]   This is disingenuous of epic they've had
[01:57:13.620 --> 01:57:16.580]   apps on our app store for 10 years
[01:57:16.580 --> 01:57:20.660]   They've benefited from their presence on the app store for 10 years
[01:57:21.140 --> 01:57:27.220]   Now apple says epics business interests lead it to push for a special arrangement that would be unfair to other
[01:57:27.220 --> 01:57:29.220]   developers
[01:57:29.220 --> 01:57:33.460]   Whose reputation is more risk here epics or apples in?
[01:57:33.460 --> 01:57:38.820]   Um, honestly, I think this is a really interesting case because I mean let's face it
[01:57:38.820 --> 01:57:44.100]   You don't get fortnight because it's on the apple store you get fortnight because it's a really good game
[01:57:44.100 --> 01:57:49.300]   Um, and apple has said they run a closed ecosystem if you want apps on our phones
[01:57:49.700 --> 01:57:54.420]   Or on our hardware you have to go through us and that seems blatantly anti-compestive
[01:57:54.420 --> 01:58:00.580]   I've missed on a foreigner over here and but even so I mean what does that happen if you did do with anything?
[01:58:00.580 --> 01:58:05.060]   Well, I mean not knowing quite how oh what our anti-trust was
[01:58:05.060 --> 01:58:06.500]   They're different
[01:58:06.500 --> 01:58:10.500]   I've been told like mike's probably more an expert of on this than I am but they're different in the
[01:58:10.500 --> 01:58:13.220]   In the EU than they are here in the in the in the
[01:58:13.220 --> 01:58:20.900]   Very much so yeah, you would not get away with this in the EU, but I mean us regulators are very much the sort of
[01:58:20.900 --> 01:58:24.740]   Oh, well do whatever you like and will will issue a minor fine
[01:58:24.740 --> 01:58:27.940]   Honestly, I'm with epic on this one and yes apple
[01:58:27.940 --> 01:58:31.860]   Slept walked into this, you know, they walked right into an ambush
[01:58:31.860 --> 01:58:36.020]   They had the epic at the trailer ready to go. They had the lawsuits ready to go
[01:58:36.020 --> 01:58:42.420]   This was done around about the time that apple was facing anti-trust talks in congress
[01:58:42.900 --> 01:58:46.980]   This was a hit job pure although if I'm a if I'm a fortnight player
[01:58:46.980 --> 01:58:55.220]   I might be pissed off on the one hand because we know tim sweezy person swiney personally made seven billion dollars last year
[01:58:55.220 --> 01:59:02.100]   From fortnight the gay epic made even more so it's not like they're hurting giving apple their 30 percent hasn't hurt them
[01:59:02.100 --> 01:59:09.860]   Uh, it's the principle of the thing surely. I mean, yes, okay apple says if you if you want to run software on our phones
[01:59:10.180 --> 01:59:14.340]   You have to give us 30 percent that seems to me to be anti-competitive
[01:59:14.340 --> 01:59:18.180]   So this year we we really had the pleasure of talking to one of my
[01:59:18.180 --> 01:59:24.580]   Favorite people he's a great science fiction author. He's a deep thinker and he's an advocate for privacy
[01:59:24.580 --> 01:59:26.340]   security
[01:59:26.340 --> 01:59:34.260]   Uh, kori doctor. Oh, kori had some really great things to say in our episode that we did with with kori and another one of my favorite guests
[01:59:34.260 --> 01:59:36.500]   Amy web he talked about
[01:59:36.580 --> 01:59:40.660]   Well, it's his term. I'll let him explain the chickenization of america
[01:59:40.660 --> 01:59:46.980]   By the way, I want to recommend people read the reposts went up this week on
[01:59:46.980 --> 01:59:52.580]   On one zero on medium one zero dot medium dot com how to destroy surveillance capitalism
[01:59:52.580 --> 01:59:57.780]   Which is a pers it's a prescription in effect for for how to how to fix this?
[01:59:57.780 --> 01:59:59.460]   issue
[01:59:59.460 --> 02:00:04.020]   Um, it's easy for us to see that the dominance of a handful of companies is a problem
[02:00:04.100 --> 02:00:08.100]   It's a lot harder to think of how you how you fix that they're not going to go easily
[02:00:08.100 --> 02:00:12.660]   Government yeah our government at least in the united states is run by money
[02:00:12.660 --> 02:00:19.220]   Uh, and so of course the biggest companies in fact, that's larry lessig remember wanted to very much wanted to eliminate
[02:00:19.220 --> 02:00:22.580]   Drm, but he realized he's not that's never going to happen
[02:00:22.580 --> 02:00:29.780]   Unless you change how political financing works. So his you know, he changed his goals. He said well first we got to fix
[02:00:29.780 --> 02:00:32.580]   We got to fix money the problem of money in government
[02:00:33.700 --> 02:00:38.820]   So there's um, there's another copyright scholar a colleague of of larry's a guy named james boil
[02:00:38.820 --> 02:00:45.380]   Uh from duke university who has a really good riff about this, which is that before the term ecology was coined
[02:00:45.380 --> 02:00:49.460]   There were people who cared about like owls and people who cared about the ozone layer
[02:00:49.460 --> 02:00:53.700]   And while they didn't like hate each other they didn't really see themselves as fighting in the same fight
[02:00:53.700 --> 02:00:59.460]   They were they were issue based campaigners and the term ecology said that like yes, you're interested in owls
[02:00:59.460 --> 02:01:02.500]   And i'm interested in the ozone layer, but what we're both fighting for is ecology
[02:01:03.060 --> 02:01:08.900]   And it it took, you know a thousand different issues and turned it into a movement with a thousand ways in
[02:01:08.900 --> 02:01:11.140]   And movements get stuff done
[02:01:11.140 --> 02:01:17.060]   And so in terms of monopoly and like it's opposite pluralism, which is why you know these days in the pluralistic dot net
[02:01:17.060 --> 02:01:19.380]   In terms of monopoly
[02:01:19.380 --> 02:01:21.860]   There are people who are really worried about monopoly
[02:01:21.860 --> 02:01:26.820]   Even if they don't care about tech and they don't know it, but they're all on the same side like, you know
[02:01:26.820 --> 02:01:31.380]   I take off my glasses and it says made in italy because they're all over people's glasses
[02:01:31.460 --> 02:01:34.580]   And all of her peoples is a subsidiary of a company called l'exautica
[02:01:34.580 --> 02:01:41.300]   Which has bought every single eyewear brand you've ever heard of as well as lens crafters target optical seers optical
[02:01:41.300 --> 02:01:46.740]   The major lens manufacturer and the major and sure sun glass hot
[02:01:46.740 --> 02:01:54.180]   Yeah, they own oakley they own every versace they own every brand you've ever heard of they've raised prices a thousand percent in 10 years
[02:01:54.180 --> 02:01:58.660]   If you need prescription glasses you care about monopoly even if you don't know it yet
[02:01:59.060 --> 02:02:04.100]   And then like you know people who watch john, it's like it is really like the frog in the boiling water because yeah
[02:02:04.100 --> 02:02:07.940]   I pay 700 bucks for my glasses now when I only paid 150 10 years ago
[02:02:07.940 --> 02:02:13.860]   But it kind of went up gradually so I didn't really notice and I certainly didn't know it was exotic his fault
[02:02:13.860 --> 02:02:19.060]   But there's a lot of people who have more urgent causes right like if you're a pro wrestling fan
[02:02:19.060 --> 02:02:24.820]   Then you might have noticed in the last couple of years that all the wrestlers you love are begging on go fund me for money
[02:02:24.900 --> 02:02:29.140]   To pay their medical bills so they can die with dignity in their 50s when they work for rated injuries
[02:02:29.140 --> 02:02:34.500]   And it's because vincebick man bought all the other wrestling leagues there used to be 30 now there's one
[02:02:34.500 --> 02:02:40.020]   He's he's reframed all of his workers as contractors and you took away their health insurance
[02:02:40.020 --> 02:02:47.380]   And so wrestling fans also have common cause and it's like it's like ozone layer and owls right there were people who cared about the ozone layer
[02:02:47.380 --> 02:02:49.620]   They didn't really understand what was going on with the owls
[02:02:49.620 --> 02:02:54.340]   They knew that there was something really bad going on with the ozone layer when they heard about the hours like that's really alarming
[02:02:54.340 --> 02:03:01.540]   But i'm focused on the ozone layer and it wasn't until we got into ecology rather than issues that people were able to say
[02:03:01.540 --> 02:03:08.260]   We're all fighting for the same thing and like even though the way i'm fighting for it is by working on the ozone layer
[02:03:08.260 --> 02:03:11.380]   I am going to support the ecology movement per se
[02:03:11.380 --> 02:03:14.980]   And we are on the brink of people who are worried about
[02:03:14.980 --> 02:03:19.460]   You know concentration and meatpacking all of a sudden that became pretty sailing at this year
[02:03:19.460 --> 02:03:23.780]   Right as they as slaughterhouses also became charnel houses where meatpackers were
[02:03:24.260 --> 02:03:26.260]   dying and sickening due to
[02:03:26.260 --> 02:03:30.740]   Massive concentration in the sector that allows them to treat their workers really badly
[02:03:30.740 --> 02:03:34.260]   Chicken farmers have some of the highest suicide rate in the country
[02:03:34.260 --> 02:03:37.620]   It's because there's there's only three major chicken packers left
[02:03:37.620 --> 02:03:44.740]   And there's a process that they use called chickenization for their labor force where the farmers are technically independent workers
[02:03:44.740 --> 02:03:51.780]   But they have to buy the coop that the that perdue tells them to buy they have to buy the feed they have to use the medicine
[02:03:51.780 --> 02:03:56.500]   They have to put the chickens on the lighting schedule that produce specifies and then perdue
[02:03:56.500 --> 02:04:00.820]   Tells them how much they're going to pay at the very end and they get to calculate it
[02:04:00.820 --> 02:04:04.660]   So it's just enough to keep them growing chickens, but not enough to let them go ahead
[02:04:04.660 --> 02:04:08.900]   And if that sounds familiar, it's because it's the same thing that uber drivers have to do with
[02:04:08.900 --> 02:04:14.820]   So every sector is facing this kind of both monopoly and monopsony where you have a buyer
[02:04:14.820 --> 02:04:17.940]   Who's concentrated all the power among their suppliers?
[02:04:18.260 --> 02:04:21.940]   And you also have a seller who's concentrated all the power among the consumers
[02:04:21.940 --> 02:04:26.980]   And and it's like an hourglass and they're these people who are manning the pinch between the two bulbs
[02:04:26.980 --> 02:04:32.260]   And you know, we like to think that those of us on this side of the bulb have nothing to come with those of us on that's out of the bulb
[02:04:32.260 --> 02:04:34.580]   It's not true. We're like we're all on the same side
[02:04:34.580 --> 02:04:37.780]   We're on the side of people who want to get rid of the people in the middle running the pinch
[02:04:37.780 --> 02:04:41.220]   And this is how we got trust busting, you know a hundred years ago
[02:04:41.220 --> 02:04:43.220]   This is how we got the new deal
[02:04:43.220 --> 02:04:48.020]   Is that people woke up one day and they said standard oil is the same problem as the rail trust
[02:04:48.020 --> 02:04:52.980]   Is the same problem as the electricity trust is same problem as atnt is the same problem as amp
[02:04:52.980 --> 02:04:57.220]   And they got together and they made common cause and you know
[02:04:57.220 --> 02:05:02.100]   We're coming to that moment again or at least that's how I think we can find our way out of it
[02:05:02.100 --> 02:05:06.980]   Corey, I think if you successfully unite all of these causes into a single cause
[02:05:06.980 --> 02:05:12.180]   We should retain chickenization as the word that describes what happens to the victims
[02:05:12.180 --> 02:05:15.140]   I totally agree
[02:05:15.140 --> 02:05:18.660]   I learned that word from a Zephyr Teachout book that just came out called break him up
[02:05:18.660 --> 02:05:23.780]   But she got it from someone else and I forgot who it is someone who wrote a a big expose on the meatpacking industry
[02:05:23.780 --> 02:05:28.260]   But you know like it's the same thing with farmers. It's the same thing with
[02:05:28.260 --> 02:05:35.140]   Hospitals right like the reason that hospitals are as brittle as they are the reason our medical system is as brittle as it is
[02:05:35.140 --> 02:05:38.900]   Is because private equity funds have been buying and merging hospitals
[02:05:38.900 --> 02:05:44.740]   And making them more and more debt loaded laying off primary staff and hiring them back as contractors
[02:05:44.980 --> 02:05:50.340]   Doing all the stuff they did that made toys are us into a failing business except it's our entire health care system
[02:05:50.340 --> 02:05:52.660]   Such as it is in this country. So, you know
[02:05:52.660 --> 02:05:56.100]   Jc penny went and
[02:05:56.100 --> 02:05:59.860]   Sears. Yeah, it's an it what's happening
[02:05:59.860 --> 02:06:07.140]   What's actually the good thing about covid-19 is all the fractures in society are being brought to the the surface because they are brittle
[02:06:07.140 --> 02:06:10.900]   And and all it took is was you know a little crack
[02:06:10.900 --> 02:06:14.020]   And the whole thing is starting to shatter and it doesn't look good
[02:06:14.660 --> 02:06:18.660]   It's gonna I fear though that we're gonna it's gonna be a very disruptive
[02:06:18.660 --> 02:06:24.100]   Period of several decades as we work this all out and I'm not getting all hacked
[02:06:24.100 --> 02:06:29.220]   I'm not at all convinced that your side's gonna win. I feel like the pinch has a lot of power
[02:06:29.220 --> 02:06:32.180]   And and you know it's interesting how
[02:06:32.180 --> 02:06:37.140]   You bring up the word ecology because the other thing that they do is they change the language
[02:06:37.140 --> 02:06:41.460]   So it used to be everybody was against pollution. Nobody's for pollution
[02:06:41.940 --> 02:06:44.980]   But you change it to climate change well now we can have a debate
[02:06:44.980 --> 02:06:51.780]   and uh, so there are all sorts of techniques that the the people in power used to keep
[02:06:51.780 --> 02:06:54.340]   us from
[02:06:54.340 --> 02:06:56.820]   Revolting against the chickenization of the world
[02:06:56.820 --> 02:07:01.460]   Very interesting. That's why I call it the climate emergency instead of climate change. That's a better way
[02:07:01.460 --> 02:07:06.980]   It's a good term for all of us to adopt. Yeah, yeah, nobody's nobody's against pollution. Nobody's for pollution
[02:07:06.980 --> 02:07:13.140]   Everybody's against pollution, but uh climate change. Well, who knows what that is. Maybe it's just a natural force
[02:07:13.140 --> 02:07:17.300]   Another favorite all year long. Oh, doctor. Of course
[02:07:17.300 --> 02:07:23.300]   This was a very difficult year for the United States in race relations. Oh, doctor
[02:07:23.300 --> 02:07:25.860]   Had something I think very powerful
[02:07:25.860 --> 02:07:30.180]   To say about that and I thought we really should include it in our best of watch
[02:07:30.180 --> 02:07:33.060]   So first thing a great show
[02:07:33.060 --> 02:07:39.540]   I was super quiet today because there were people that were vastly smarter than me and I didn't feel like dueling and getting stabbed to death
[02:07:39.540 --> 02:07:42.660]   So that's why I was quiet. I can learn some of the two I was taking notes
[02:07:42.660 --> 02:07:46.420]   I got spellings to check up on after the show. So I got I got some work to do
[02:07:46.420 --> 02:07:49.540]   Through myself together this episode
[02:07:49.540 --> 02:07:53.540]   but um I get a lot of emails for people after I'm wanting to show and uh
[02:07:53.540 --> 02:07:56.980]   Most of them are great. Some people yell at me and they have a problem with me
[02:07:56.980 --> 02:08:01.940]   And I fully understand how they can seem that like I'm so angry or some people think I'm too happy
[02:08:02.180 --> 02:08:04.180]   So I just want to tell you one experience of mine
[02:08:04.180 --> 02:08:09.300]   So do you understand like the climate that we're in in the world when you see people get frustrated and they lash out?
[02:08:09.300 --> 02:08:10.340]   Okay
[02:08:10.340 --> 02:08:14.100]   I'm doing pretty well for myself at a certain point in time. I said i'm going to buy a big house
[02:08:14.100 --> 02:08:16.100]   I buy a big house in a nice neighborhood
[02:08:16.100 --> 02:08:19.300]   3 000 square feet three car garage. It's only me and my daughter
[02:08:19.300 --> 02:08:21.300]   But I feel like I deserve it so I get it
[02:08:21.300 --> 02:08:26.820]   And the three years as I lived there I got pulled over 87 times in that neighborhood or generally around that area
[02:08:26.820 --> 02:08:28.500]   I only got six tickets
[02:08:28.500 --> 02:08:32.820]   So you do the math on how many times I was pulled over for no reason just because I had a nice car
[02:08:32.820 --> 02:08:35.060]   And I look like I look and I'm in a nice area
[02:08:35.060 --> 02:08:40.900]   Back when sandy hit a big storm people kind of know about it the power went out of my house
[02:08:40.900 --> 02:08:45.780]   I went to go stay at a friend's house in philadelphia. I come back home. My house is robbed
[02:08:45.780 --> 02:08:52.020]   50 000 other equipment my computers my cameras all the stuff that I do and use to make a living for myself
[02:08:52.020 --> 02:08:55.460]   We're all gone. They left the tv's on the wall because I guess they couldn't get them out
[02:08:55.460 --> 02:08:57.780]   But everything else of electronic value was gone
[02:08:58.660 --> 02:09:01.460]   Um, I didn't call the police out to my home
[02:09:01.460 --> 02:09:03.460]   I went to the police station to file a report
[02:09:03.460 --> 02:09:05.940]   The detective as he's taken on her port. He said well
[02:09:05.940 --> 02:09:07.380]   Why didn't she call us out to the house?
[02:09:07.380 --> 02:09:11.940]   And I said I've seen videos of people calling police when their homes been invaded and they've been shot
[02:09:11.940 --> 02:09:14.820]   And he looked at me and said fair point
[02:09:14.820 --> 02:09:16.980]   Oh, I took down the police report
[02:09:16.980 --> 02:09:19.140]   Took down the police report
[02:09:19.140 --> 02:09:21.140]   I filed my insurance company
[02:09:21.140 --> 02:09:21.940]   Now
[02:09:21.940 --> 02:09:26.980]   Sally for me they did take my safe which had a lot of my receipts the paperwork receipts in there
[02:09:27.220 --> 02:09:29.220]   And I had copies of them scanned in the cloud
[02:09:29.220 --> 02:09:35.620]   But the insurance company kind of screwed me out of 60 000 of equipment because they said that I could falsify these documents that were scanned
[02:09:35.620 --> 02:09:37.860]   Because I don't have the paper documentation
[02:09:37.860 --> 02:09:41.300]   So I get really frustrated with my life. I think to myself
[02:09:41.300 --> 02:09:43.780]   I've been pulled over so many times and it's nice beautiful home
[02:09:43.780 --> 02:09:46.820]   It's too big for me anyway. I want to sell it take a loss and move
[02:09:46.820 --> 02:09:51.300]   As I'm packing up to move with my daughter. You have the door open. Have you ever moved out of a place?
[02:09:51.300 --> 02:09:54.180]   I left the door open because I'm coming in and out
[02:09:54.980 --> 02:09:56.500]   I come downstairs
[02:09:56.500 --> 02:10:01.620]   There's 12 cops outside my house. She's 11 in the front. No 10 in the front two in the back
[02:10:01.620 --> 02:10:04.180]   Guns drawn
[02:10:04.180 --> 02:10:08.580]   Sorry to have idea. What are you doing here? Blah blah blah blah. I said whoa, what's going on?
[02:10:08.580 --> 02:10:11.860]   Like oh, we've had a lot of robberies on the street. I'm like, yeah, I know I'm one of the people
[02:10:11.860 --> 02:10:17.140]   Well, I need your license. What do you need my listers moving boxes here? I'm I'm packing up with my child
[02:10:17.140 --> 02:10:19.220]   Why do you why do I have to get you my ID?
[02:10:19.220 --> 02:10:23.460]   Now mind you all these people have guns in their hands and they're all very anxious and I'm just like dude
[02:10:24.180 --> 02:10:27.780]   My detective's name is detective. He's actually name is Michael Jackson funny enough
[02:10:27.780 --> 02:10:31.060]   His name is Michael Jackson. How would I know the detective like
[02:10:31.060 --> 02:10:35.860]   I've had a gun pulled on me by cops four times in my lifetime the first time
[02:10:35.860 --> 02:10:40.180]   I was 11 years old and it took another cop to come and grab that cop and say hey
[02:10:40.180 --> 02:10:41.860]   This is a kid put your gun down
[02:10:41.860 --> 02:10:47.540]   So I do know that there's crazy people that shouldn't have guns and there's good people that have common sense working in that business
[02:10:47.540 --> 02:10:51.300]   But I take it back to where I was living at in that timeframe
[02:10:52.020 --> 02:10:54.260]   Lost everything still got harassed
[02:10:54.260 --> 02:10:58.420]   But you wouldn't know that I come on this show and I make jokes and I have fun
[02:10:58.420 --> 02:11:02.580]   And I just do what I got to do and I'm ranting and raving and joe josh joccan
[02:11:02.580 --> 02:11:06.100]   Because that's the way I have to live my life knows the things I have to do on a regular basis
[02:11:06.100 --> 02:11:09.140]   So when you see things out in the world, you wonder why people get soft set
[02:11:09.140 --> 02:11:12.900]   It's because I'm not the only person that gets pulled over all the time for no reason
[02:11:12.900 --> 02:11:16.900]   I'm not the only person that gets harassed for no reason. I'm not the only person that's had a gun pulled on them
[02:11:16.900 --> 02:11:19.060]   For literally no reason
[02:11:19.060 --> 02:11:22.660]   But I have to go in about my day and be thankful and say sorry
[02:11:22.660 --> 02:11:26.900]   Yes, sir. No, sir and tell the line and I say that to say
[02:11:26.900 --> 02:11:31.620]   Tomorrow i'm putting up a video from two years ago from me and aunt that I've recorded
[02:11:31.620 --> 02:11:34.580]   Because I got so depressed and all my stuff got so I
[02:11:34.580 --> 02:11:39.940]   Opposed to it, but i'm trying to be in my chat week bozeman and tell you again to do better
[02:11:39.940 --> 02:11:43.780]   Even though I built myself back up. I got all my cameras back. I got all my lenses back
[02:11:43.780 --> 02:11:47.140]   I worked hard. I bought new stuff. I got a new insurance company
[02:11:47.700 --> 02:11:52.580]   And I've got myself back on my feet, but you can do the same thing too
[02:11:52.580 --> 02:11:54.420]   So if you're having a bad day, you're down
[02:11:54.420 --> 02:11:56.820]   I noticed my tweet him earlier and it said that I seem like I'm saying
[02:11:56.820 --> 02:11:59.940]   I'm really sad about this bozeman thing because I really think to myself
[02:11:59.940 --> 02:12:04.180]   I'm fat. I'm overweight. I'm living in a pandemic. I can die any day and I should be doing more
[02:12:04.180 --> 02:12:07.940]   So I again, I encourage you to do more and if you're still listening
[02:12:07.940 --> 02:12:10.180]   I know you care enough to at least try for yourself
[02:12:10.180 --> 02:12:16.260]   I'm your boy in jail. They're starting to kill doc another twits in the can got you up. Yeah, bless you. Oh, doctor. God. We love you
[02:12:16.820 --> 02:12:18.820]   Thank you
[02:12:18.820 --> 02:12:20.820]   God
[02:12:20.820 --> 02:12:22.340]   Yep, Bravo
[02:12:22.340 --> 02:12:25.220]   That's why we like these uh these closers. He's the best
[02:12:25.220 --> 02:12:27.540]   Thank you
[02:12:27.540 --> 02:12:33.700]   We're almost done our last segment of the show the the inventors of live blocking
[02:12:33.700 --> 02:12:40.740]   Remember those days peter when you had a sit and live blog and announcement. You don't do that anymore. I bet
[02:12:40.740 --> 02:12:45.140]   Uh, I don't but um, but we we were the first site to do that
[02:12:45.540 --> 02:12:47.540]   Were you you in the gadget?
[02:12:47.540 --> 02:12:50.100]   Um, yeah, nice
[02:12:50.100 --> 02:12:53.540]   Um, we we had somebody the way you used to do it is
[02:12:53.540 --> 02:12:57.540]   Uh, the phones the connections were so slow that one person would be there in the room
[02:12:57.540 --> 02:13:01.540]   And then they would be sending the messages over aim. Oh my god
[02:13:01.540 --> 02:13:05.620]   Aime who would then put it into the cms. Oh my god
[02:13:05.620 --> 02:13:12.660]   See this is what we need on the internet history scene. That's how long ago was they were using aol's instant messenger
[02:13:12.660 --> 02:13:15.060]   the late great
[02:13:15.060 --> 02:13:18.660]   It was uh, it was a real process right and this was a little soft there
[02:13:18.660 --> 02:13:24.020]   They have software platforms for that now, right? Oh, yeah, they totally well. They did you know what they may be gone now
[02:13:24.020 --> 02:13:30.340]   For a while there was this boom in live blogging and they had a bunch of plavars. I bet they're all gone by now
[02:13:30.340 --> 02:13:37.220]   I think they are I think a lot of the sites have their own. Yeah, but they do their own. I think at one point there was a plugin for
[02:13:37.220 --> 02:13:38.740]   um
[02:13:38.740 --> 02:13:43.460]   Aim that where you could essentially use it to live blog and it would send it to certain cms
[02:13:44.100 --> 02:13:48.340]   So, uh, you could actually do it directly. You would need the other guy typing it in
[02:13:48.340 --> 02:13:54.740]   I think some of this went away when companies like apple. Thank god finally started live streaming instead of you know
[02:13:54.740 --> 02:14:00.420]   They put it up on youtube so the public could watch yeah, and so we wouldn't have to go to and gadget to see
[02:14:00.420 --> 02:14:02.980]   Uh, what's going on? Yeah, there's still some live blog
[02:14:02.980 --> 02:14:10.020]   24 live blog calm real time infrastructure for today's newsroom
[02:14:11.220 --> 02:14:16.100]   So there are still some businesses doing that. It's fun when you can get all of these
[02:14:16.100 --> 02:14:18.180]   segments together
[02:14:18.180 --> 02:14:23.540]   It's really fun to see the breadth the depth the fascinating conversations the really great panelists
[02:14:23.540 --> 02:14:25.700]   We have on twit twit is the one show
[02:14:25.700 --> 02:14:32.660]   Uh, we do uh all week long that has a rotating cast and the reason I do it that way is because
[02:14:32.660 --> 02:14:35.860]   There are too many people I want to talk to every week
[02:14:36.260 --> 02:14:39.300]   And there there are too many shows I want to do so with twit
[02:14:39.300 --> 02:14:44.820]   I'm able to each week try a different bunch of people bring them together. We get great conversations
[02:14:44.820 --> 02:14:49.220]   Sometimes bring in experts on the topics that everybody was talking about that week
[02:14:49.220 --> 02:14:53.220]   Sometimes we just bring in somebody because it's time to have some fun
[02:14:53.220 --> 02:14:55.940]   But uh every weekend twit is uh, I think
[02:14:55.940 --> 02:14:59.860]   Well worth listening to I hope so I feel that way. I hope you do too
