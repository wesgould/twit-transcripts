[00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.440]   And I've got two great people and maybe a third
[00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.440]   joining us in just a bit.
[00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.720]   Let's start with David Spark, old friend from,
[00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.520]   I want to say tech TV, but it's really ZD TV.
[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:09.040]   Yeah, I started one month before the station even began.
[00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.360]   And still around doing what?
[00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.360]   [ Laughter ]
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.560]   I'm doing a lot of things.
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.360]   I'm the tech reporter for 960 of the quake.
[00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.720]   It's a progressive talk radio station here in town.
[00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.960]   They do talk now?
[00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:24.760]   It's all talk.
[00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.200]   It used to be progressive rock.
[00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.040]   Now it's progressive talk.
[00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.040]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.280]   It's in San Francisco and it's a liberal radio station.
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.880]   And so it's like, you know, they're the perfect station
[00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.280]   for the perfect market, I guess.
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.160]   Anyway, they also, they play a lot of the
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.280]   air-american feats as well.
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.840]   And I'm doing that also, you know, the Guide Wire Group,
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.640]   the guys who co-produced the demo conference,
[00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.800]   I work as an analyst for that.
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:49.880]   Cool.
[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.840]   And so I'm covering lots of new technologies,
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.120]   a lot of Web 2.0 stuff.
[00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.400]   And then lastly, I had my own custom publishing business,
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.120]   which is sort of this merger of my 12 years of journalism
[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.560]   and 10 years in the ad industry.
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.560]   I wanted to get David on Twitch for so long.
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.080]   So I'm really glad we could get you on.
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.320]   I ran into you the other day at a seminar and a good thing.
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:12.200]   We did.
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.760]   Joining us also by phone, I hear her.
[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:16.600]   Hello?
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.440]   Veronica Belmont.
[00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.280]   Hi, Veronica.
[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.120]   Hi. How are you?
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.680]   Great to talk to you.
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:21.920]   Yeah, I'm glad to be back.
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.440]   And we have a good reason to talk to you
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.880]   in just a second.
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.120]   In fact, let me introduce your new boss.
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.200]   Veronica, of course, was-- well, still is.
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.160]   I'm going to still say it with Buzz Out Loud,
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.760]   bol.cinet.com, because your last day hasn't come yet.
[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.560]   And on cinettv.com.
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.600]   But I know it's coming soon.
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:39.960]   When's your last day there?
[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.400]   On my last day of Friday.
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.640]   Oh, my God.

[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.680]   One more week.
[00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.000]   And here's the very, very, very, very smart fella
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.040]   who snapped you up, Jason Calicanis.
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.200]   Thanks for having me.
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.600]   Back 50 episodes later.
[00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:55.440]   A reprise?
[00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.400]   No, not a reprise of "Twit 57," I promise.
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.560]   That was insane, wasn't it?
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.720]   Andrew Barron will not join us later on.
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:05.920]   The mini mogul.
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.720]   Actually, Jason, you've kind of--
[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.840]   since then, you've been doing the mini-- still mini, by the way.
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.920]   You've been not yet a--
[00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:13.440]   Oh.
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.560]   Not yet a Rupert Murdoch.
[00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.120]   That was the greatest line, I think,
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.080]   ever in the history of podcasting.
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.400]   When he told me that I didn't know what I was doing
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.280]   and that he was going to be the next Rupert Murdoch.
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.040]   You've got to be careful when you make those claims.
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.000]   Yeah, in public, in recorded form, you really--
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   whenever I hear stuff like that, I go, oh, he's that.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.320]   You know, I think I missed that one.
[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.280]   Yeah, well, it actually was a good one to miss.
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.200]   It's still considered the worst Twitter ever.
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.600]   Although, Veronica, you were on the second worst Twitter ever.
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:42.680]   You should be glad to know.
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:43.520]   Apparently.
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:44.920]   Yeah.
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.960]   We did the iPhone thing a couple of weeks ago,
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.080]   and I thought it was actually, frankly, great.
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.040]   I like that episode.
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.040]   Yeah.
[00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.280]   Who critiques the worst Twitter ever?
[00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.320]   I mean, is there a Twitter waiting board?
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:57.600]   Dig fanboys.
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.320]   Dig fanboys, exactly.
[00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:00.440]   We know it was just an overkill.
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.800]   I mean, we had so much iPhone news.
[00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:02.800]   It wasn't overkill.
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.680]   People were at the end of their limit.
[00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:05.560]   They were sick of it.
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:06.400]   Some, not they.
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.240]   Some, a few, a few vocal.
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.440]   Few were sick of it.
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.240]   I defended the death, our coverage of the iPhone.
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.760]   It was fair.
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.280]   It was even handed, and it needed to be done,
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.200]   because it was a significant product, perhaps one
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.720]   of the most significant products in a decade.
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.280]   I don't think there's any-- I don't have any--
[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.920]   It's the greatest gadget and the most significant gadget ever
[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:23.760]   built.
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.400]   I was going to say that.
[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:26.600]   I actually get my--
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.200]   Mine in my hand right now, too.
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.360]   OK, stop stroking your iPhone, Jason.
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.880]   Hello.
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.120]   David, are you the only one without an iPhone?
[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.440]   I do not have an iPhone, and I will not be buying one,
[00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.680]   until probably 10, 2, or 10, 3.
[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.760]   Playing the part of John C. de Vorac on this week's episode,
[00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:42.920]   Mr. David Spark.
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:43.440]   Mark.
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:44.440]   Mark.
[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:45.440]   Mark.
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.040]   John is not with this week.
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.720]   I did ask him.
[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:48.720]   Believe me, I asked him.
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.560]   I think he's out of town.
[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.200]   This is actually a tough time to get people on,
[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.120]   but I was really anxious.
[00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.360]   In fact, to get both Jason and Veronica on,
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.640]   to talk about what's going on.
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.120]   So Veronica, you announced this week on Buzz Out Loud
[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:08.800]   that you would be leaving CNET, a CUSH job with a health plan
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.800]   to go to work for Mahalo.
[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.240]   Well, hopefully I still have a health plan.
[00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.760]   Jason?
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:15.080]   I'm banking on.
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.440]   We have health plans here.
[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:17.440]   We have health plans, right?
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:18.440]   It's to be.
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:19.440]   No, of course.
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.440]   We are a well-funded startup.
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:22.440]   What is Mahalo?
[00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.160]   Because I thought it was a search--
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.280]   a human-powered search.
[00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.200]   It's a human-powered search engine.
[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.440]   We are handwriting the search results.
[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:33.280]   And obviously, handwritten search results
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:34.600]   is better than one made by a machine,
[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.200]   because it doesn't have spam, and it's organized,
[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.040]   and all those other great things.
[00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:38.560]   And--
[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.560]   You mean like Yahoo, right?
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.600]   I guess like Yahoo used to be, or D-Maws, that it's best, or--
[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:44.840]   D-Maws is great.
[00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.280]   And it's unfortunate that it doesn't get more attention,
[00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:48.280]   because I like the idea.
[00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:49.600]   Yeah, it's kind of falling apart now.
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.000]   And the SEOs have taken it over.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   Yeah, unfortunately.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.320]   It's very sad, actually.
[00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:54.320]   Well, Jason--
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:55.320]   Go ahead, David.
[00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:56.960]   Oh, I was going to ask you--
[00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.680]   I was looking at Mahalo and your plans
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.640]   for it and the fact that it's going to take you another year
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:03.960]   and a half to get up and running.
[00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.960]   But with a human-powered search engine,
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.160]   how are you going to stay up to date?
[00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.040]   I mean, something you did a year ago
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.200]   is not going to be current today if you
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:14.160]   create this search engine.
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.000]   So I mean, just wondering, how are you going to do that?
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:17.920]   That's a great question.
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.800]   And that's a question I got most from investors,
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.040]   from the press, from analysts.
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.920]   It's a very fair question.
[00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:27.600]   One of the things we did was we were built off
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.040]   of the software Media Wiki, which
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:31.720]   powers a lot of great wikis out there,
[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.880]   like Wikipedia and Wookiees.
[00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:37.560]   And we added to it the ability to syndicate RSS feeds.
[00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:41.000]   So when we do something on the news,
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.320]   you can go to the news section right now, look at it,
[00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:48.120]   or even with musicians, we will pull in three, four, five RSS
[00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:49.480]   feeds, mash them together.
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.120]   And so when you go pull that page down,
[00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.120]   you've always got some recent news.
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.880]   The second thing we do is we don't let pages get older
[00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:57.600]   than, say, 60 days old.
[00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.880]   The full-time staff and the part-time staff
[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:01.480]   keep them up to date.
[00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:02.840]   And that has a cost to it.
[00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.640]   The RSS doesn't have a cost to it.
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:06.840]   And then the third thing is the public submits links.
[00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:11.840]   So if you had an iPhone link, like does it blend the iPhone
[00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:14.160]   link, that got submitted to us a bunch of times
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:17.120]   on the iPhone SERP search engine result page.
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:20.320]   And when people submit a link, it goes to the guide,
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:21.480]   the guide that makes a decision.
[00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:22.160]   Is it spam?
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:24.400]   If so, delete it and ban that URL.
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:25.800]   Is it great?
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.520]   If so, include it in the search result.
[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:31.040]   And if it's just somewhere between those two opposite ends,
[00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:32.240]   leave it in the recommended list.
[00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:35.680]   So we rely on the public, our full-time staff, our part-time
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:37.800]   staff, and technology to keep them up to date.
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:41.800]   How big is your-- I mean, this must take a lot of people.
[00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:43.720]   Yeah, we've got close to 50 people now.
[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:45.240]   We'll have 100 by the end of the year.
[00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:45.240]   Wow.
[00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:46.280]   Now I take it--
[00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:48.800]   Veronica is not going to be somebody who's
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:51.480]   doing handwritten search results.
[00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:52.000]   No.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:52.500]   No.
[00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:54.640]   Veronica, you feel like doing some search results?
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:55.480]   I mean, I could.
[00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:57.240]   If you're going to pay me a little bit more than do that,
[00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:57.960]   I'm all about it.
[00:07:57.960 --> 00:07:59.440]   What are you doing there?
[00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:02.320]   First of all, I want to say, Mahalo means thank you in Hawaiian.
[00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:02.720]   That's right.
[00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:03.880]   M-A-H-A-L-O.
[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:04.840]   And hello, isn't it?
[00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:06.280]   It's like Shalom, too.
[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:06.640]   Isn't the mean--
[00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:07.520]   That's a Loha.
[00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:08.480]   Don't confuse Mahalo.
[00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:08.880]   Hello, I'm Gary.
[00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:10.360]   Mahalo with Aloha.
[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:12.680]   The origin of the word is to admire.
[00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:15.520]   And then it became known as thank you, eventually.
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:17.520]   It's a very special word to Hawaiians.
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:19.320]   And the tagline of the companies were here to help.
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:21.840]   So the concept of what we're doing with Veronica
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:24.080]   is the Mahalo daily.
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:27.920]   And it will be hard doing what she's been doing, which is,
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:31.200]   I think, entertaining people and informing them, which
[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:34.920]   she's very capable of doing and very entertaining.
[00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:37.280]   On a daily basis about technology and about--
[00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:38.200]   Kind of like a rock culture.
[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:40.960]   Or--
[00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:43.960]   I hope not to a certain extent, because my feeling on a rock
[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:47.320]   a boom was always a little bit content light.
[00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:50.360]   I think what attracted me to Veronica's work
[00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:53.040]   is that she does have great delivery
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:55.520]   and she's got great presence on air.
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:57.640]   But she also has the substance behind it.
[00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:00.040]   If she talks about Twitter, it's from the perspective
[00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:03.120]   of somebody who's put in 50 hours into the product.
[00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:04.520]   Or if you talked about the iPhone,
[00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:05.760]   it's on the basis of somebody who would--
[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:07.520]   Is that all Veronica just 50 hours?
[00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:09.160]   I know, right?
[00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:11.360]   She's like, I wish.
[00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:14.000]   Can I have those 50 hours back, please?
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.080]   They're all going over to Pounce now.
[00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:16.880]   Yeah, what do you think?
[00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:18.760]   Are you a Pounce?
[00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:21.440]   I moved to Jiku, and now I'm torn between Jiku and Pounce.
[00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:23.080]   I can't go back to Twitter.
[00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:24.560]   I see you on both.
[00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:28.120]   Unfortunately, I've kind of dropped Jiku out of the rotation.
[00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:28.640]   Who has time?
[00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:31.040]   I still have feeds updating on there.
[00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:33.760]   And I like the service a lot, but I think between Twitter
[00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:35.720]   and Pounce has pretty much covered my--
[00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:38.160]   So you're going to keep this in terms of letting people know
[00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:41.200]   every little bit of my day.
[00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:43.520]   So you're going to do a daily-- how long?
[00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:45.640]   Daily 10 minutes, half an hour?
[00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:47.120]   Anywhere between three and 10 minutes,
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:49.640]   depending on the topic, I would say.
[00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:51.520]   We have a bunch of different kinds of videos
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:53.200]   that we're going to be doing.
[00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:56.880]   Anywhere from interviews to how to something
[00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:00.960]   a little more product-related, maybe a comparison type of thing.
[00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:04.480]   So similar to what you were doing in CNET TV,
[00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:07.000]   but kind of your own show, though.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:07.280]   Right.
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:09.640]   It's going to be my own show.
[00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:12.560]   Sometimes we'll have specialists on topic available
[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:14.800]   to talk with me about something.
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:16.480]   And also, it's going to be more general.
[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:18.320]   It's not just going to be technology.
[00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:20.480]   So I can talk a little bit more about pop culture
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:21.920]   and other stuff that I'm interested in.
[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:22.840]   You're very good at that.
[00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:23.800]   I've had you on the radio show.
[00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:25.440]   And I hope you'll still do that, by the way.
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:26.000]   Oh, of course.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.880]   And you turn your own me on Twitter, radio.
[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:28.720]   I'll do it all.
[00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:28.960]   Yeah.
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:33.720]   And what's great is you do represent a certain segment.
[00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:36.520]   It's way too old to be represent, to be part of that segment.
[00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:39.480]   So it's great to hear what you kids, what you young people
[00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:40.400]   are doing.
[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:42.520]   We'd like to get that on the show, too.
[00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:42.960]   Yeah.
[00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:43.640]   Well, that's exciting.
[00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:45.000]   So it's your own thing, which I think
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.760]   must have been a part of the factor in making the decision.
[00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:48.520]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:48.600]   Yeah.
[00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:51.440]   I'm very much excited about it to have a lot of the creative
[00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:55.000]   freedom to kind of talk about all the stuff that interests me.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.600]   And you know, CNET is a wonderful, wonderful place.
[00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:59.240]   And it's very bittersweet in a way,
[00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:00.680]   because I love working there.
[00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:02.440]   And I love doing Buzz Out Loud.
[00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:04.160]   But there's a whole wide world out there.
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:07.080]   And I'm ready to do some new stuff.
[00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:09.120]   So let's get to the tech news.
[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:11.560]   We'll talk a little bit more about Mahalo as time goes by.
[00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:15.880]   But this is a very red letter day, a significant day.
[00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:19.960]   This is the day the music died, or maybe not.
[00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:24.920]   This is the day that the copyright royalty board chose
[00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:26.680]   is the day that the new royalties would
[00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:32.160]   be due from internet radio stations for playing music.
[00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:35.520]   And potentially, we could see hundreds of thousands
[00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:37.160]   of radio stations shut down today.
[00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:40.040]   Now, the latest is that maybe they won't.
[00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:41.280]   There might be a reprieve.
[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:43.320]   But frankly, if I'm an internet broadcaster
[00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:46.560]   playing commercial music, the reprieve, to me,
[00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:49.320]   doesn't seem to appealing.
[00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:55.720]   The sound exchange testified in front of Congress this week
[00:11:55.720 --> 00:12:00.800]   saying that, well, we won't--
[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:03.520]   if you don't pay us right away, we won't bill you,
[00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:04.320]   we'll negotiate.
[00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:07.440]   But you do have to sit down at the table with us and talk.
[00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:13.000]   And you could owe interest on the royalties.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.600]   It's a little scary if I'm an internet broadcaster.
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:18.920]   You don't-- Jason, you don't play any real music on your real music.
[00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:20.920]   And he's-- actually, you don't play any unreal music.
[00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:21.320]   Any signs--
[00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:24.120]   Yeah, I don't put music under my stuff when I do my podcast.
[00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:27.120]   And when I do it, we do independent music, which I like.
[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:28.120]   Yeah, I hope that--
[00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:28.520]   I hope that--
[00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:29.320]   --the most positive choices.
[00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:30.200]   Yeah.
[00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:33.320]   I hope they just raise the price to the point of absurdity,
[00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:35.960]   put net radio out of business, and shoot themselves to the foot,
[00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:38.720]   and then create a market for all these emerging artists.
[00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:39.240]   I think it's--
[00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:40.400]   I have the same exact thought.
[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:44.120]   I feel like, in a way, I don't want them to settle on this.
[00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:45.520]   This is the greediest--
[00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:47.000]   I mean, this could be the beginning
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.200]   of the end for the recording industry.
[00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:51.640]   Their greed, finally, puts them out of business.
[00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:53.760]   If I would like to see all these internet broadcasters just
[00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:56.160]   start using unsigned artists.
[00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:58.880]   Yeah, that would be one way of doing it, I guess.
[00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:00.000]   You don't like it?
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.800]   I'm not too fond of it.
[00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:04.200]   I don't really see a good way out at this point.
[00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:07.720]   I mean, like you said, the greed is so overwhelming
[00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:10.160]   that they can't really go back, but going further
[00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:12.200]   kind of scares me as well.
[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:13.800]   We've talked about this before.
[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:15.440]   And I have a theory--
[00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:17.560]   maybe it was the VORAC's theory, but I have a theory about what
[00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:18.600]   happened.
[00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:23.560]   The Copyright Royalty Board approved this outrageous royalty,
[00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:25.680]   not only a royalty now on publishing rights,
[00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:28.800]   but also on performance, which commercial radio does not
[00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:31.680]   play, although I think the RIA is also
[00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:34.080]   going after them for that.
[00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:36.680]   And worse than that, it's a huge royalty.
[00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:40.080]   And it was retroactive to the beginning of 2006.
[00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:41.760]   So many of these internet broadcasters,
[00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:44.520]   if they had to pay today, would owe bills, astronomical bills,
[00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:44.960]   I think--
[00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:47.520]   Well, they knew that going into that, too.
[00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:49.600]   I mean, they knew that this was coming up.
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:51.480]   So all the internet radio stations--
[00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:53.800]   But they didn't know that it would go back to January 1,
[00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:55.000]   2006, did they?
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.400]   I mean, this is something they had to sit on.
[00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:57.200]   Oh, yeah, they did.
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:59.000]   Talking to Rusty Hodge about it.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.800]   I mean, the big surprise was they knew
[00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:05.080]   they were going to have retroactive payments on this,
[00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:07.560]   but what they didn't know is how big it was going to be.
[00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:09.680]   And that's what scared them all.
[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:10.320]   Rightly so.
[00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:13.520]   I mean, most of these guys don't make any money at all.
[00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:14.280]   Right.
[00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:15.600]   But I think two things.
[00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:18.840]   One, what you just mentioned earlier,
[00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:21.600]   sound exchange, they can price them completely out.
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:24.160]   And just everything will shift back to terrestrial radio.
[00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:27.000]   And terrestrial radio will control everything.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.160]   But I might point out that they want to do the same
[00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:30.800]   to terrestrial radio.
[00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:31.600]   These guys don't--
[00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:33.360]   They don't want to stop.
[00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:36.480]   They want to charge performance royalties to terrestrial radio
[00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:37.000]   as well.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   Well, and don't they double hit them, too,
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.720]   if they play terrestrial and online?
[00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:43.920]   Yeah.
[00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:47.040]   So they have to cough up double the money.
[00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:50.320]   Tim Western, if Pandora says we're going to stay on the air,
[00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:51.240]   but I've talked to him before.
[00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:52.960]   He said, we'll owe millions.
[00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:54.960]   Yeah, this is going to be really huge for Pandora,
[00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:56.800]   which is really unfortunate considering they've just
[00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:58.200]   made a lot of really--
[00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:00.160]   why don't I say really a few more times-- really, really,
[00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:01.400]   really major for them.
[00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:04.320]   They had deals with Sonos and cell carriers
[00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:05.880]   and all sorts of great stuff in the works.
[00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:10.480]   And to just be totally knocked out at the park with this is sad.
[00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:11.680]   It's a very--
[00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:15.000]   a lot of the times, these people think it's a zero-sum game.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.920]   And they have to-- they can't think about this big open ocean
[00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:20.280]   where they can just make money many different ways,
[00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:22.200]   many different levels of money.
[00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:23.680]   And they don't want to do any hard work.
[00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:25.560]   They want to have one size fits all.
[00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:27.440]   And it's insane.
[00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:31.400]   But it's like Princess Leia said, the more you tighten your grip,
[00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:34.160]   the more galaxies go through your fingers kind of a thing.
[00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:34.640]   Right.
[00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:35.840]   They're just going to tighten their grip to the point.
[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:36.680]   They're going to lose everybody.
[00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:39.000]   It's going to go offshore.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.480]   Keep creating things like hype machine,
[00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:41.600]   which I almost don't want to mention,
[00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:42.800]   because it's such an awesome service.
[00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:43.000]   But--
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.280]   Yeah, don't give it away.
[00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:44.640]   Oh, yeah.
[00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:45.120]   I know.
[00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:46.040]   Every time I mention a hype machine,
[00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:47.440]   I just think to myself, shut up, Jason,
[00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:48.560]   because it's such a great service.
[00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:49.720]   You're going to ruin it.
[00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:50.720]   I try never to mention it.
[00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:51.160]   So what is it?
[00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:53.160]   What is it?
[00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:53.600]   Hype--
[00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:55.640]   Nobody listens to this show you could talk about it.
[00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:57.280]   It's not like Call of Candice cast.
[00:15:57.280 --> 00:15:58.240]   Hype, exactly.
[00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:00.360]   hypem.com, hype machine.
[00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:01.440]   And what happens?
[00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:03.880]   You basically, they go across all the blogs out there,
[00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:08.960]   and they pull all of the MP3s on them.
[00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:12.560]   So you can go there, type in Bob Dylan,
[00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:14.920]   and then create-- it will create an RSS feed for you
[00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:16.760]   that you can add to your iTunes.
[00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:20.880]   And then you pull down all these Bob Dylan tracks
[00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:22.280]   that are mentioned on people's blogs.
[00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:24.160]   But you'll sign up for it, and then all of a sudden,
[00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:27.280]   you'll have like Dylan doing a cover,
[00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:29.520]   or somebody doing a cover of Dylan.
[00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:31.680]   All this crazy stuff just winds up in your iTunes.
[00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:34.480]   So you take out your iPod, you go to your hype machine feed.
[00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:35.880]   And bang, you got some interesting stuff.
[00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:36.880]   You have the Condemandom on it.
[00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:37.680]   It's really cool.
[00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:39.280]   There's a cool little hack for the iPhone
[00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:40.400]   to kind of do something simpler.
[00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:42.600]   I think it's with a search engine called SoundSeek,
[00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:43.840]   something like that.
[00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:44.760]   It's a website.
[00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:46.080]   And because--
[00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:47.800]   Do you know it?
[00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:51.760]   Yeah, it sounds like the one that sort of combines people's
[00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:52.800]   with the iPhone--
[00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:54.800]   I mean, excuse me, iPod directories?
[00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:56.800]   I guess it is, because I mean, I've only
[00:16:56.800 --> 00:17:00.120]   played with it on the Safari on the iPhone.
[00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:02.360]   But it's awesome, because what happens
[00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:06.920]   is it aggregates people who've got MP3s online, many of them
[00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:11.400]   illegal, and SeqPod, S-E-E-Q-P-O-D.
[00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:11.840]   That's what it is.
[00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:13.400]   Oh, yeah, I wrote-- excuse me, SeqPod.
[00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:16.200]   I wrote about these guys for a guide wire group actually.
[00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:18.600]   So it works great on the iPhone, because it can play MP3.
[00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:20.200]   So you just click the links.
[00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:22.360]   And all of a sudden, on your iPhone,
[00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:24.840]   you're listening to music via Wi-Fi or the Edge,
[00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:26.560]   if you could get any Edge.
[00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:27.040]   And--
[00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:27.600]   It's really cool.
[00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:31.440]   You can create playlists and share playlists with people.
[00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:34.640]   The major problem is that, yes, a lot of it's illegal.
[00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:35.120]   It's illegal.
[00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:37.720]   It's just like HyperM, it sounds like.
[00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:39.640]   Yeah, but the other thing is that being
[00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:42.400]   that they're only pointing to MP3 files,
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:45.200]   the quality of listening is all over the mouth.
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:48.680]   I mean, you may be connected to a great connection
[00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:52.440]   on one song of the next connection, maybe just trickling.
[00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:54.440]   So it's very, very erratic.
[00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:56.920]   Yeah, there's no quality control going on.
[00:17:56.920 --> 00:18:00.680]   Well, Jason and Veronica, if you want to try it on your iPod,
[00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:04.240]   they have SeqPod.com/iPhone, I should say.
[00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:05.680]   They have a special iPhone page.
[00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:06.680]   And it looks just like your iPhone.
[00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:08.000]   It's really cool.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.600]   They also do it for video.
[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:10.240]   It's pretty cool.
[00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:12.560]   The video tech, they've got as well.
[00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:13.560]   Oh, neat.
[00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:14.360]   This is the problem.
[00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:16.240]   This is exactly Princess Leia's problem
[00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:17.680]   is that you can't stop this.
[00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:18.680]   It's all digital now.
[00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:19.880]   How are you going to tell you?
[00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:23.280]   You know, shutting down internet radio is not the solution.
[00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:24.960]   If you look at when they introduced iTunes
[00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:28.240]   in the 99 cent track, piracy went down
[00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:31.840]   because convenience went up and it was sort of a fair price.
[00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:35.800]   You know, I think if they went down to $0.25 or $0.50 per track,
[00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:37.360]   they would sell 10 times as many tracks.
[00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:41.360]   So I don't think they've really, you know, actually taken that
[00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:42.160]   as far as they could go.
[00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:43.760]   They could get rid of piracy completely.
[00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:45.960]   It's really an economic and convenience issue.
[00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:47.400]   There's a good study came out of--
[00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:49.160]   I think it was University of Toronto.
[00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:51.480]   They addressed this exact issue, did a very--
[00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:53.040]   I think comprehensive study and came up
[00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:54.440]   with a price of a nickel attract.
[00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:57.040]   They said, at that price, we believe the industry would
[00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:59.560]   make more money for exactly this reason.
[00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:01.960]   Why would you steal it if you can get it for a nickel?
[00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:02.360]   Yeah.
[00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:04.960]   I mean, look at DVD as a story in the New York Times
[00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:07.920]   today about DVDs and why people don't--
[00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:09.880]   so Hansel did it on-- why people don't copy them.
[00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:14.040]   Well, a DVD only costs $4 to rent or whatever, you know,
[00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:15.600]   with your Netflix account.
[00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:19.480]   And the cost of copying a DVD from what I've heard,
[00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:22.040]   I wouldn't know this firsthand, is a half hour to two hours,
[00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:23.880]   depending on if it's got over 4.7 gig
[00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:26.080]   and if you've got to compress it and whatever.
[00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:27.920]   So not that I have any personal experience.
[00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:31.040]   Well, also people don't watch DVDs and videos
[00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:32.880]   at the repetition basis.
[00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:33.640]   They do listen to--
[00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:34.240]   Precisely.
[00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:34.720]   Precisely.
[00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:35.320]   So it's not worth it.
[00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:36.800]   You're only going to watch it once.
[00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:39.800]   When rental is so cheap, I spend all that time and money
[00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:41.080]   to make a copy of it.
[00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:43.800]   And also, there isn't a music rental business
[00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:44.840]   in the same sense.
[00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:48.160]   I mean, there is with tools like Napster and Rhapsody
[00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:48.680]   and whatnot.
[00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:49.120]   But it is--
[00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:49.880]   Yeah, but it's different.
[00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:50.960]   --kind of the same.
[00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:53.440]   I've always been opposed to subscription models,
[00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:54.960]   even though I know they're very popular.
[00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:58.800]   I belong to the school of wanting to own all my music.
[00:19:58.800 --> 00:19:59.440]   Interesting.
[00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:00.800]   It's just something mental with me.
[00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:02.080]   Like, I like having the collection.
[00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:03.520]   I think it heartens back to when people
[00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:05.200]   had giant CD collections.
[00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:07.840]   And it was like a big deal to show off how many CDs you have.
[00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:10.360]   I like to have a giant music collection on my hard drive.
[00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:11.360]   But do you also--
[00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:11.860]   Right.
[00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:12.360]   --just show me--
[00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:13.360]   --history--
[00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:14.800]   --movie collection as well?
[00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:16.400]   Do you want the same with your movies?
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:19.120]   You know, I'm not really the same with that, which is weird.
[00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:21.280]   I'm OK with renting movies, because I really only
[00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:22.880]   want to watch one movie once.
[00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:24.440]   Like just like you said.
[00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:26.360]   This is a study from the NPD group.
[00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:31.120]   It says that they monitored 12,000 Americans of the people who
[00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:32.320]   had--
[00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:36.480]   well, of them, only 1 and 1/2% had DVD ripping software.
[00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:38.200]   2/3 of those who had it used it.
[00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:40.840]   But 12% of the people monitored burned their own music.
[00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:43.280]   So it's a significant difference in the number
[00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:45.920]   of burned DVDs and the number of burned CDs.
[00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:49.080]   But the reason people do steal DVDs
[00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:52.120]   is because they--
[00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:52.880]   the timing of them.
[00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:54.480]   So again, availability.
[00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:56.920]   If you don't make the product available,
[00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:59.440]   people will buy it for $5 on Canal Street in New York.
[00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:00.720]   You know, a Boolay copy.
[00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:02.960]   And that's really why people are going to the Pirates Bay
[00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:05.320]   and downloading films.
[00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:06.640]   And also, convenience.
[00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:09.840]   Like if I want to watch something on my iPhone or my iPod,
[00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:13.240]   I don't want to take a DVD, transcribe it, spend an hour
[00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:15.080]   and a half doing that.
[00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:16.840]   I think a lot of people would just rather go to sites
[00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:20.920]   like Pod Trappelis, which is a site I heard about from a friend.
[00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:22.080]   I've never been there.
[00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:25.720]   But they seem to have all the movies already in iPod format
[00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:26.640]   at Pod Trappelis.
[00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:27.120]   Oh, really?
[00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:27.760]   That's handy.
[00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:28.320]   Yeah.
[00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:29.960]   I just heard about it from a friend.
[00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:30.800]   But I've never been to it.
[00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:34.680]   But as you know, Chase, it's not the PDP sites that
[00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:38.360]   are the problem with the stealing video of which there
[00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:38.920]   is a lot of that.
[00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:43.200]   But it's actually just these big DVD copying houses
[00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:48.040]   that worse cases are like in Indonesia and areas of Russia
[00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:52.480]   where they have such a low percentage of actual legal sales
[00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:53.720]   of DVDs.
[00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:55.960]   It's a real black market kind of industry
[00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:58.040]   that's damaging more than anything.
[00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:00.760]   It's not really the individual users you're saying.
[00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:01.200]   Yeah.
[00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:05.240]   I mean, I'm trying to remember who I think
[00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:06.200]   was someone at the MPA.
[00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:08.520]   I wrote a piece about this for e-content magazine
[00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:09.680]   a long time back.
[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:12.360]   And this was just very much the case
[00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:14.000]   that that was more the concern because there
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.920]   was a direct connection between money they were losing
[00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:22.560]   because they were selling physical DVDs at the time.
[00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:24.840]   I'm going to be speaking tomorrow to a group.
[00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:26.600]   The video software-- it used to be the Video Software
[00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:27.520]   Dealers Association.
[00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:29.600]   They now call themselves the EMA.
[00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:32.280]   And it's the keynote for their conference, big conference
[00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:33.360]   in Vegas.
[00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:34.440]   And what they're doing is they're
[00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:36.240]   doing a panel of consumers.
[00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:38.120]   They've got like 10 consumers.
[00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:40.480]   And that's what they're going to do is they're going to say,
[00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:42.480]   actually, that's what I'm supposed to do for them is.
[00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:45.800]   So tell me, it's OK to talk about this.
[00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:46.920]   Do you steal music?
[00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:48.960]   Do you steal video?
[00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:50.000]   What are you up to?
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.600]   Just between you and me.
[00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:52.800]   And of course, the people in the audience
[00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:56.120]   are not only people who buy and sell DVDs,
[00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:57.640]   but also the motion picture industry
[00:22:57.640 --> 00:22:59.240]   who's trying to get them to buy their DVDs.
[00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:00.600]   So it'll be very interesting.
[00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:04.120]   I feel like I'm going to the lion's mouth there.
[00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:05.680]   I think I witnessed the tipping point, though,
[00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:10.440]   on stealing movies at the full camp that Tim O'Reilly does.
[00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:11.760]   I'm definitely named dropping there.
[00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:13.720]   But I got invited for the first time this year.
[00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:15.560]   I'm so jealous.
[00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:17.360]   They're just about 10 miles away.
[00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:19.040]   And I could hear you guys having a party.
[00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:21.280]   And I was not invited.
[00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:23.440]   Here are various people landing in their helicopters.
[00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:24.320]   Yeah, Larry Page.
[00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:25.680]   Helicopter Den is funny.
[00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:26.480]   It's kind of cool, actually.
[00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:28.160]   But we're there.
[00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:29.720]   And everybody's talking about Sicko.
[00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:31.080]   And I'm like, oh, yeah.
[00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:33.920]   And everybody has seen the film.
[00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:35.920]   And I just asked myself, I don't think this film is out yet.
[00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:37.360]   It wasn't out yet.
[00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:38.520]   It wasn't out yet, I don't think.
[00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:41.520]   And so everybody had downloaded a rough bit torrent.
[00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:43.480]   And unlike when the haul came out,
[00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:46.920]   or I guess Revenge of the Sith came out same week,
[00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:48.840]   and haul came out two weeks before,
[00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:51.640]   those are films that you would want to see on a big screen,
[00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:53.120]   special effects, et cetera.
[00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:56.840]   This was a DVD rip of a documentary, which is much better
[00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:59.680]   to watch at home or on a plane than in a theater with people
[00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:01.760]   talking and whatever.
[00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:03.000]   So I mean--
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:06.840]   But that's also an example.
[00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:08.040]   I'm sorry, go on.
[00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:09.920]   Sorry, I just said, I've got to think Sicko took a hit
[00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:11.200]   in the box office because of that.
[00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:12.000]   Yeah, I think you're right.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.160]   And that's what the MPA complains about most,
[00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:16.920]   is when people are stealing at release time,
[00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:20.200]   because you know, the arc of sales,
[00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:23.240]   you've got your first weekend and then an X number of weeks
[00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:26.160]   in the box office, and then it shifts over to DVD sales.
[00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:28.440]   And if something comes in, like, it
[00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:31.960]   gets distributed on a P2P network anywhere on that sales cycle,
[00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:33.120]   they're going to take a major hit.
[00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:33.640]   And this was--
[00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:35.400]   But I think Jason makes an excellent point,
[00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:37.680]   because you're not going to take a hit if it's a big movie
[00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:38.960]   that you want to see on a big screen.
[00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:40.760]   It's just a teaser for it.
[00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:43.320]   You're still going to go see the movie, but not Sicko.
[00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:44.240]   You're absolutely right.
[00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:44.720]   Right.
[00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:46.200]   I mean, that is true, Jason.
[00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:47.200]   I agree on that.
[00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:49.720]   So do you think for the method of when a lot of studios
[00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:51.400]   have been quietly contemplating--
[00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:53.160]   and I think even a couple have tried this--
[00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:56.200]   of releasing the DVD on the same day that the movie comes out
[00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:57.440]   in theaters.
[00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:59.760]   So do you think that it's different between blockbusters
[00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:00.560]   and documentaries?
[00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:03.320]   Like maybe this wouldn't hurt a big summer blockbuster
[00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:05.240]   by releasing the DVD on the same day,
[00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:09.640]   or would it not work for something like Sicko?
[00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:12.960]   I think that you could sell the DVD of Spider-Man
[00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:16.400]   or Pirates of the Caribbean for $50 online,
[00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:19.000]   and you get it by FedEx that Friday.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.320]   I think you would have-- you could charge $75.
[00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:23.520]   I think you would have tons of people doing it
[00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:25.560]   to have parties at their house.
[00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:30.480]   You would be like the cool person to have the $75 DVD special
[00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:33.920]   limited edition of $10,000, whatever, with a poster or something.
[00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:35.960]   What kind of people waited in line for six hours
[00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:38.000]   to get a $600 phone so they could be the first one
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   in the office to show it off?
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:39.520]   Exactly.
[00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:41.040]   I mean, it would be fantastic.
[00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:43.880]   And they could have the alternate ending at the same time.
[00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:45.920]   So in the movie theater, you can't see the alternate ending.
[00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:48.240]   But if you spend $75 on this one,
[00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:50.040]   you get a party kit with it or something.
[00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:53.360]   So yeah, and also Sicko, why not release it on the web
[00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:57.280]   and get Ford or somebody who wants that Volvo,
[00:25:57.280 --> 00:26:00.160]   somebody who wants that demographic to--
[00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:01.040]   Somebody-- yeah, right?
[00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:02.000]   Safety, health, whatever.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:02.480]   Somebody crunchy.
[00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:02.840]   Somebody want that.
[00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:03.840]   Somebody want that.
[00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:04.840]   Yeah.
[00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:06.920]   I get one of those to give you $3 million
[00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:08.120]   sponsored online.
[00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:09.200]   How much is the film going to make?
[00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:10.760]   That's $3 million in pure profit.
[00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:12.000]   It's not going to affect the box.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.360]   What this underscores is that the problem
[00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:17.080]   is that these movie companies, these music companies,
[00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:19.440]   are holding on to this old business model
[00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:22.840]   with their claws to the bitter end,
[00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:26.000]   whereas any entrepreneur and Jason, you're a great example,
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.360]   can see many ways to use these new technologies to do better.
[00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:31.440]   And they still want-- Peter Rojas.
[00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:32.400]   --want that go.
[00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:33.600]   Peter Rojas with Record Label.
[00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:35.960]   I think is Peter Rojas, who did Engadget
[00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:39.920]   and created Gizmoa before that, is a tremendous entrepreneur.
[00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:41.240]   He's starting this thing Record Label.
[00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:44.320]   And he's going to be doing artists that
[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:50.520]   are sponsored by advertisers and the MP3s are available for free
[00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:51.440]   on a website.
[00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:52.440]   It's a genius idea.
[00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:53.480]   He's going to clean up.
[00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:54.760]   It's going to be huge.
[00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:57.280]   I don't think there's very much an us versus them.
[00:26:57.280 --> 00:27:01.560]   They just don't want to cannibalize their big budget
[00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:03.440]   or the things that makes them the most money, which
[00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:05.440]   is like theater sales and DVD sales.
[00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:07.400]   They're all up for other distribution.
[00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:09.560]   They can't see to new models.
[00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:10.560]   That's the problem.
[00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:12.280]   Oh, certain new models are coming up.
[00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:16.480]   Like extra stuff you can see on websites and whatnot.
[00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:19.560]   I mean, I'm playing the anti-John de Vore here
[00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:21.200]   and supporting industry right now.
[00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:22.560]   I think what they're just trying to do
[00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:23.840]   is keep the life cycle.
[00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:26.880]   When you release a Spider-Man, they want the sales life cycle.
[00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:29.600]   Like, the roots gets released this summer, still showing it.
[00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:31.640]   And then when Christmas comes around,
[00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:32.800]   they can sell the DVD.
[00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:36.200]   Because they're going to make more money in using that cycle.
[00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:38.880]   If you do the cycle, the JSON suggests, well,
[00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:40.840]   it's probably not going to make as much money.
[00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:44.120]   Because people get-- there's Spider-Man fix all at once.
[00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:46.240]   And then they'll move on to something else, come
[00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:47.280]   Christmas time.
[00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:50.000]   You know, maybe it would be good to try that model on movies
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.600]   that aren't expected to perform very well in the theaters.
[00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:56.560]   Because a lot of movies have a short life cycle in the theaters.
[00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:59.960]   And then when the DVD comes out, they do really great.
[00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:02.200]   So maybe if there's an anticipation that is not
[00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:04.640]   going to do well within the first few months of being
[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:07.040]   in the theaters that they do it with releasing the DVD
[00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:08.120]   on the same day.
[00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:10.320]   And that way, they don't have to wait to make their profit.
[00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:12.520]   They just bank off the DVDs right away.
[00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:14.120]   What happened to Mark Cuban's plan?
[00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:18.080]   Remember Mark made a movie and released the DVD the same day.
[00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:19.640]   And this was going to be the model.
[00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:20.840]   Yeah, that's one of those kind of--
[00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:22.600]   He's pulled back a little bit on it.
[00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:24.760]   But I think the issue for him was,
[00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:27.800]   I don't think he had one of these big blockbuster--
[00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:28.760]   Well, perfect example.
[00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:30.000]   Yeah, he's exactly what--
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.400]   But I don't think they've given it up.
[00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:32.440]   He's given up on it yet.
[00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:40.400]   And I think the problem is, if you look at music companies
[00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:41.560]   and movie companies specifically,
[00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:43.160]   if you go to their offices and say,
[00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:45.640]   who sells the advertising here, they would just look at you
[00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:46.720]   like you're crazy.
[00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:48.720]   Whereas you go to a newspaper, a magazine, or an internet
[00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:50.880]   company, you say who sells ads here?
[00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:52.720]   It's like, OK, that's like these three floors.
[00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:54.880]   It's 60% of the people in the building.
[00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:57.560]   And for a music company or a movie company
[00:28:57.560 --> 00:28:59.680]   to not have an ad sales group, it's crazy.
[00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:02.760]   And they will have-- I predict all this stuff
[00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:03.840]   is going to be ad supported.
[00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:05.720]   And you're seeing it happen at CBS and ABC.
[00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:07.120]   I just saw it transformers.
[00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:09.640]   Somebody's selling ads in the movies.
[00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:11.640]   My god, there was more product placement.
[00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:12.840]   Wow.
[00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:14.440]   There was more product placement in that.
[00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:15.200]   I'm going to tell you, though.
[00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:16.480]   And maybe you want to Camaro real bad.
[00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:17.520]   Yeah, no kidding.
[00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:18.120]   No kidding.
[00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:19.400]   Real bad.
[00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:21.440]   GM did very well in that movie, I think.
[00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:22.600]   I'm not even a car person.
[00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:26.720]   I wanted an 18-wheeler after that.
[00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:29.600]   So Veronica, you were at your first E3 this week.
[00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:30.880]   I was, yes.
[00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:34.240]   So you'd never seen the big Razzle-Dazzle E3.
[00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:36.080]   No, unfortunately, I never got to cover it
[00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:37.800]   when it was super cool and fun.
[00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:39.720]   And was it super cool and fun this week?
[00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:40.640]   Absolutely not.
[00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:41.160]   Yeah.
[00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:44.080]   Just a bunch of press conferences and airplane hangars.
[00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:46.720]   It was totally boring and somewhat depressing.
[00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:47.640]   Oh, god.
[00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:50.040]   But there's a new rock star game.
[00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:51.440]   Don't you want to play that?
[00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:53.520]   Yeah, rock star-- the new rock star game?
[00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:53.920]   Yeah.
[00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:54.440]   Yeah.
[00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:54.960]   Yeah.
[00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:55.120]   No, no.
[00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:55.680]   I mean--
[00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:56.520]   Rok band?
[00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:57.240]   Rok band, that's it.
[00:29:57.240 --> 00:29:58.000]   Rok band, yeah.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:58.680]   I was like--
[00:29:58.680 --> 00:29:59.760]   It's like guitar--
[00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:02.040]   I know rock stars confusing because they do grand theft.
[00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:02.520]   Right.
[00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:03.040]   Not new to me.
[00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:05.720]   The rock band is the guitar hero for somebody
[00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:06.880]   who wants to sing or--
[00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:08.120]   Oh, it looks so much fun.
[00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:09.480]   Yeah, I thought you might be into that.
[00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:13.040]   Yeah, I can't wait to get my applause on that one.
[00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:13.640]   I mean, I--
[00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:14.560]   Save it for the show.
[00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:15.400]   Save it for the show.
[00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:16.000]   Save it for the show.
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   Don't waste it.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:17.360]   I know.
[00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:18.200]   I haven't even gotten.
[00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:21.280]   I'm still trying to work on hard on guitar hero too.
[00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:22.800]   My fingers just don't want to do.
[00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:25.000]   But I don't want to go any higher than one of the orange ones.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:26.360]   What's your show's name going to be, by the way?
[00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:27.600]   I don't think we asked.
[00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:29.280]   We haven't totally pinned it down yet.
[00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:31.120]   So we've got some ideas.
[00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:33.120]   The VB show.
[00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:33.920]   It will definitely be--
[00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:34.720]   Yeah, it might be the holiday.
[00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:35.480]   That might be it.
[00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:36.840]   But we'll figure it out.
[00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:38.480]   We'll figure out something good.
[00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:41.280]   Definitely with Veronica's name somehow incorporated
[00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:41.960]   into the name.
[00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:43.440]   It's got to be.
[00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:46.040]   See, that's the new model because I'll tell you what,
[00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:49.280]   in the television business, they keep your name way out
[00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:50.640]   of the title just in case, right?
[00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:53.040]   They don't want to give you any star billing.
[00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:53.520]   Yeah.
[00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:54.520]   That's the ear in your--
[00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:55.280]   That's opposite here.
[00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:55.920]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:57.080]   Don't you smart?
[00:30:57.080 --> 00:30:58.400]   But I did get to meet--
[00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:01.520]   I was one great part about Yifu, was I got to meet Ashigarum
[00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:02.080]   Miyamoto.
[00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:02.880]   Oh, neat.
[00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:03.600]   And that was like--
[00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:04.800]   He's the Nintendo god, yes.
[00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:05.240]   Right.
[00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:06.920]   That was like an ultimate moment for me.
[00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:09.520]   I was doing an interview with George Harrison, who
[00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:12.560]   was the senior VP of marketing for Nintendo.
[00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:15.040]   And I saw Miyamoto's song come in.
[00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:17.320]   And I was like, I have to go shake his hand.
[00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:20.040]   If I don't do it right now, I'm never going to forgive myself.
[00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:21.120]   He designed Mario?
[00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:21.960]   What did he--
[00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:25.760]   Yeah, I am Mario, and all the good stuff, all the great oldies,
[00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:27.600]   all the new stuff.
[00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:29.360]   He's done amazing work.
[00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:30.880]   And was he gracious?
[00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:31.960]   Very much so.
[00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:32.960]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:34.120]   I just went up and said, hi.
[00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:35.360]   I'm Veronica from CNET.
[00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:38.680]   I just wanted to introduce myself and say I'm a big fan.
[00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:40.320]   Yeah, CNET, you've got to get--
[00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:42.280]   The next step is you've got to say,
[00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:44.840]   can I get you on my show on Mahalo?
[00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:46.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:47.960]   Exactly.
[00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:50.080]   I was still on CNET time at that point.
[00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:51.480]   I know, I know, I know.
[00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:53.880]   And Leo, you can have Veronica on every week
[00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:56.640]   if she can say Mahalo half as many times as--
[00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:58.520]   Vorax says, devorac.org/blog.
[00:31:58.520 --> 00:32:00.160]   She can say, I like saying Mahalo.
[00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:02.200]   There's something nice about Mahalo, whatever you play.
[00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:03.680]   It tested the original name of the company
[00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:04.920]   was going to be 20.com.
[00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:05.440]   But--
[00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:05.960]   That's good.
[00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:07.040]   I like Mahalo better.
[00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:08.720]   Mahalo's so much better.
[00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:11.120]   Are you in Hawaii, is that why?
[00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:12.040]   Yeah, I love Hawaii.
[00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:12.840]   I got married there.
[00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:16.000]   And I just always loved the word Mahalo.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.200]   And I was able to buy it for 11,000.
[00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:19.600]   Unfortunately, I bought it.
[00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:22.120]   I was able to buy it three months after I bought 20.com
[00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:23.160]   for 75,000.
[00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:23.640]   Oh, yeah.
[00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:25.280]   So now I'm sitting on 20.com.
[00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:25.560]   But--
[00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:27.120]   2-0 or 20 is spelled out.
[00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:27.760]   2-0.
[00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:28.280]   2-0.
[00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:29.160]   That's pretty good.
[00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:29.720]   That's too letter.
[00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:31.480]   I'm getting a big offers for it.
[00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:33.480]   I'm getting like $150, $200,000 off the list.
[00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:34.320]   Does somebody have like 10?
[00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:35.640]   So what are you complaining about?
[00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:37.480]   He's going to make a double your money.
[00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:38.280]   So why don't you buy--
[00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:38.960]   I'll buy all my money.
[00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:39.480]   --all your battery.
[00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:40.000]   I'll buy your battery.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.200]   40 and 50.
[00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:42.480]   I'm not into doubling my money.
[00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:43.680]   I like 100X.
[00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:45.760]   So until somebody offers me $7 million for it,
[00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:46.680]   I'm going to be very--
[00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:48.440]   it sounds like a wise investment.
[00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:50.360]   It was no big deal on your part.
[00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:51.840]   I guess you're right.
[00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:52.640]   The rich we have rich.
[00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:53.040]   I would not hurt you.
[00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:55.080]   You'd both not hurt if I were you.
[00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:57.240]   10 is available.
[00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:58.880]   Not 300, though.
[00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:00.240]   Actually, I have another good--
[00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:00.240]   No, no.
[00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:01.120]   That's not surprising.
[00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:06.440]   I bought A-D-A-Y a day, like hack.aday.com, this.
[00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:10.080]   I had this great idea of doing a website that would be--
[00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:10.640]   kind of like that.
[00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:13.240]   It'd be a daily tip or a push-down thing.
[00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:16.600]   I wanted it to be dAi.ly.
[00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:20.440]   It'd be your daily action item, dAi.ly.
[00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:23.240]   Problem is, L-Y is Liberia.
[00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:24.040]   Oh, no, Libya.
[00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:24.560]   Libya.
[00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:26.440]   Don't you have to ask the country's permission?
[00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:28.120]   Yeah, and Libya doesn't like the US.
[00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:29.680]   So I asked Amber, I said, you're Canadian.
[00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:30.800]   Maybe they'll like you better.
[00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:33.880]   And they never responded to her.
[00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:35.000]   But I was the same idea I had.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:36.200]   It's interesting you had that same idea.
[00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:37.160]   Daily tip line.
[00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:37.760]   Daily tip.
[00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:42.120]   And it was your daily action item, dAi.ly.
[00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:43.800]   And yeah, and it pushed out.
[00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:45.000]   You know where it comes from?
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:45.720]   Is that candy, Si?
[00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:48.040]   What is that, daily candy?
[00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:48.560]   Exactly.
[00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:49.720]   Yeah.
[00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:50.360]   Great idea.
[00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:52.360]   But I thought we'd get a-- it'd be like a boing moing.
[00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:55.320]   We'd get a couple of star bloggers like Amber.
[00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:58.040]   And each one would have a different beat.
[00:33:58.040 --> 00:33:59.520]   And each day, you'd have a different suggestion
[00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:02.280]   for an action item, something you should do today.
[00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:03.640]   Stop and smell the roses.
[00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:04.200]   I don't know.
[00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:05.600]   You know, now that you've set it on air,
[00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:07.360]   someone's going to try to go do your idea.
[00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:08.360]   Oh, go ahead.
[00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:09.640]   I'm not like Jason.
[00:34:09.640 --> 00:34:10.280]   I have ideas.
[00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:13.560]   But I have no implementation skills whatsoever.
[00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:15.080]   So that'll go ahead.
[00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:16.880]   That's why I listened to the show, Leo.
[00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:17.880]   That's still an idea.
[00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:18.400]   It is.
[00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:19.560]   Anything you want.
[00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:20.200]   Hey, this isn't--
[00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:23.360]   Use it just how to implement and then other people do it for you.
[00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:23.720]   Yeah.
[00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:24.000]   Yeah.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   Well, in one of these days, I'll
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.480]   figure out how to get those other people.
[00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:27.640]   That's the problem.
[00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:30.760]   Sony suing the company that did the root kit for him.
[00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:32.040]   I like that.
[00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:34.400]   $12 million in damages, they're trying
[00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:37.400]   to recover it from the company that
[00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:41.080]   made the media max, made the CD protection software.
[00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:43.400]   I guess Sony's saying we didn't know it was a root kit.
[00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:44.720]   It's their fault.
[00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:46.320]   The ultimate finger point.
[00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:46.760]   That's funny.
[00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:50.320]   I was missing the days, lamenting the days of the Sony root
[00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:50.920]   kit era.
[00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:52.160]   It was like, that was like, you know,
[00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:54.280]   we had good, meaty stories to talk about.
[00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:54.640]   Simple times.
[00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:57.160]   We weren't just complaining about the PS3.
[00:34:57.160 --> 00:34:58.160]   Like a good scandal.
[00:34:58.160 --> 00:34:59.080]   Simple times.
[00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:01.440]   Those were the good old days.
[00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:03.440]   So $100 off the PS3.
[00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:05.520]   That's now, unfortunately, it turns out
[00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:08.720]   that that $60 PS3 is being discontinued anyway.
[00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:10.320]   What a big trick.
[00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:11.160]   What a big--
[00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:11.960]   It's a double trick.
[00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:12.800]   It means six gigabytes.
[00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:13.240]   It's a gigabyte.
[00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:14.600]   This is the-- yeah, I'm sorry.
[00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:15.760]   I don't know what I said.
[00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:16.880]   It's a little spicy with the 80 gigs.
[00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:21.080]   This is the big trick is that last week on this show,
[00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:22.560]   I said, oh, yeah, there were rumors
[00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:23.320]   that we're going to do this.
[00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:27.040]   But Sony's president said, no, we're not dropping it two days
[00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:28.440]   later.
[00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:30.080]   They dropped the price.
[00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:33.720]   I was just very surprised that they did it right before E3.
[00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:35.880]   I mean, they didn't have a lot of exciting things
[00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:36.840]   to announce at E3.
[00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:38.000]   And that would have at least given it
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:39.240]   to me at the conference.
[00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:41.640]   I'll tell you, at $4.99, though, it's
[00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:44.200]   the lowest price Blu-ray DVD player.
[00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:45.440]   Forget the games.
[00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:46.560]   That was what I was going to ask,
[00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:49.240]   because I haven't bought a DVD player yet.
[00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:53.360]   And I'm still confused as to why I need to spend $2,000
[00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:54.680]   on $2, $1,000.
[00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:55.400]   Isn't that ridiculous?
[00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:56.880]   Things when the PlayStation has Blu-ray.
[00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:58.920]   And if I buy the PlayStation for $500,
[00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:00.240]   I get a Blu-ray drive, right?
[00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:03.680]   Yeah, there is another $500 player, I think, Toshiba mix.
[00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:06.160]   Or no, not Toshiba, Sony, maybe.
[00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:09.120]   But why not get the game for free?
[00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:10.800]   That's what I do at my PlayStation 2,
[00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:11.920]   instead of buying a DVD player.
[00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:14.560]   I was like, this thing is smaller, and I get games,
[00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:16.000]   and it was like $2.99.
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:17.240]   That's how I'm watching it.
[00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:19.480]   But are people going to be buying this as a DVD player
[00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:20.400]   or a gaming machine?
[00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:22.680]   Why don't they market that stuff?
[00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:25.040]   People have been buying it as a Blu-ray player.
[00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:25.560]   Why not?
[00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:26.240]   Yeah.
[00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:26.560]   Yeah.
[00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:27.160]   I don't think they're--
[00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:29.520]   And then if they ever can come up with a good game for it,
[00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:31.120]   then you could play it.
[00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:32.040]   Oh, there's a few games.
[00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:33.760]   Resistance, that's the only--
[00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:37.400]   Is there any one leading game yet for the PS3?
[00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:38.680]   Resistance is decent.
[00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:40.000]   What do you like?
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:40.800]   Veronica.
[00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:42.000]   Oh, me?
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   Huh.
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:43.640]   Yes, see?
[00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:44.800]   See what I'm saying?
[00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:46.440]   There's no standout game on the PS3.
[00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:47.240]   I don't play it online.
[00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:47.840]   What do you say?
[00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:49.280]   The PlayStation 3's come out?
[00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:51.240]   That's released?
[00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:52.360]   Yes, one of these days.
[00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:54.600]   In fact, there are very short lines to get one.
[00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:58.000]   You could walk right in the store and pick one up.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.960]   I remember actually I was there the night
[00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:01.880]   that the PS3 launched.
[00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:03.920]   And the line of people sitting there, I think,
[00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:05.360]   was all of 10 deep.
[00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:06.240]   It was pretty funny.
[00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:08.200]   It turned out it was mostly speculators.
[00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:08.560]   That was--
[00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:10.960]   There was a huge line actually down at the Metreon
[00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:12.040]   in San Francisco.
[00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:13.720]   It was going all the way down the block.
[00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:15.600]   I was covering the line for work.
[00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:16.080]   And--
[00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:20.160]   Well, they had a big concert there that night, I remember.
[00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:21.520]   They had something going on too.
[00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:22.040]   Yeah.
[00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:23.480]   But the sad thing was most of the people
[00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:24.520]   were buying it to put it on the day.
[00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:25.800]   To sell it, they were speculating.
[00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:26.600]   Yeah.
[00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:29.000]   So $4.99 for the 60 gig model.
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.960]   And will it be hard to find Veronica?
[00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:33.160]   I mean, is it--
[00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:35.360]   I think people will probably grab it up all they can.
[00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:36.360]   And there's not going to be--
[00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:37.560]   --because they're not a cheap supplier than the 80 gig
[00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:38.160]   of bike versions.
[00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:39.440]   And there's not going to be any more.
[00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:40.600]   They're not even making them anymore.
[00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:42.280]   So when they're gone, they're gone.
[00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:44.280]   It's like on the clearance rack at this point.
[00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:46.880]   They're just trying to get rid of their stock
[00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:50.160]   and under the guise of doing a price drop.
[00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:52.520]   Microsoft did not drop the price on Xbox.
[00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:53.560]   Did they have any announcements?
[00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:54.360]   Oh, I know.
[00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:56.360]   They did Halo 3, September 25th.
[00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:57.720]   Yeah, they're talking about Halo 3.
[00:37:57.720 --> 00:38:00.760]   They have a special edition Halo 3 Xbox
[00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:01.480]   360.
[00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:02.720]   It's green.
[00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:04.600]   The elite's going to be available in Europe,
[00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:07.360]   which is exciting for a lot of European people.
[00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:10.520]   They finally get their console out there, the elite.
[00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:12.800]   What exactly is different in the elite?
[00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:16.040]   Well, it's got the souped up hard drives,
[00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:18.360]   which is good, the 120 gigabyte hard drives.
[00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:20.280]   It's got the HDMI.
[00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:21.680]   Oh, yeah, it's got a connector.
[00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:23.560]   It's a bigger hard drive and a connector.
[00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:25.400]   And now in green.
[00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:25.760]   Yes.
[00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:27.120]   And now in a lovely army green.
[00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:28.640]   Now in green.
[00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:30.280]   Yeah, I have to say it's hideous.
[00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:32.800]   Really, the big news all-- it is hideous, is the hater.
[00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:33.280]   The color.
[00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:34.120]   Who would want that?
[00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:35.640]   I think it's like a 3.
[00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:38.000]   It's the same color as the master sergeant or whatever,
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.280]   master.
[00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:44.360]   I mean, I don't get-- I love Halo, but I don't get it.
[00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:47.640]   So the big, really, the big news at E3 was all we.
[00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:50.640]   Yeah, I think the biggest-- I think the most exciting press
[00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:52.960]   conference was probably Nintendo's.
[00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:55.240]   I mean, they have Wii Fit, which looks really fun.
[00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:58.000]   It's got the board that you can do all the different moves on.
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.200]   It's really just a dance dance revolution, Matt, though, right?
[00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:01.760]   It's not a-- they call it a balance board,
[00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:03.280]   but there's nothing to balance on.
[00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:04.480]   Well, I think you can move.
[00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:05.600]   I didn't get to try it out, but--
[00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:06.200]   It looks like a mat.
[00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:07.160]   --around on it.
[00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:08.840]   Yeah, but it's a mat.
[00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:09.680]   Oh, no, it's more.
[00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:10.680]   There's more.
[00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:11.200]   I think so.
[00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:13.360]   What was the game they demoed with the mat?
[00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:14.960]   I mean, I saw that too, but what they demoed.
[00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:16.000]   We fit.
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.640]   So yeah, you do yoga.
[00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:22.160]   It's the first console game with yoga involved, I believe.
[00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:23.520]   Yeah, it's got a lot of cute stuff.
[00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:25.520]   I mean, I think it'll speak to a lot of people.
[00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:27.720]   People were very excited over Wii Sports
[00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:30.680]   because they felt like they were physically getting involved,
[00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:33.240]   getting off their duffs and doing something fun.
[00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:35.120]   And this is going to take that to that next level.
[00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:38.280]   Do you game at all, Jason, do you do any of this?
[00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:42.480]   I play Texas Hold 'em Poker, but that's in the real world.
[00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:46.360]   But I used to play a lot of command and conquer.
[00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:46.920]   Command and conquer.
[00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:48.120]   That's a great game.
[00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:48.560]   Yeah.
[00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:53.000]   And I was playing the Star Wars real-time strategy
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:55.040]   was like an Empire at War or something.
[00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:56.080]   I like the real-time strategy.
[00:39:56.080 --> 00:39:56.680]   Me too.
[00:39:56.680 --> 00:40:02.560]   For me, I get flow moments when I'm in those games.
[00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:04.400]   It's like playing five games at chess at once.
[00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:07.680]   So I love playing chess or backgammon or that or Texas Hold 'em.
[00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:10.280]   Any of those games we have to really strategize.
[00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:10.760]   I love.
[00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:14.240]   But not the massively multiplayer online games.
[00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:17.280]   I did City of Heroes and I got about 50 hours
[00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:18.320]   into that level there.
[00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:20.200]   And I was like, I'm the CEO of a company.
[00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:21.680]   I can't be doing this.
[00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:22.920]   You can't be doing it.
[00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:24.880]   I have a life.
[00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:26.160]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:31.680]   Did you see any games you were just crazy about besides Rock Band?
[00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:34.440]   Well, mercenaries too looked pretty cool and burnout paradise.
[00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:37.560]   I'm a big fan of EA, so there were some good EA titles.
[00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:38.680]   They're dominant now.
[00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:42.280]   It's interesting to watch how they've really taken over the industry.
[00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:42.880]   Yeah.
[00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:44.400]   I don't know if it's their model.
[00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:47.320]   I guess it's the model they have of a cool--
[00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:49.560]   A lot of that stuff's not made in-house, right?
[00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:51.240]   They just acquire the rights to--
[00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:53.280]   it's almost a motion picture studio.
[00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:54.480]   Yeah, they're huge.
[00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:58.360]   I mean, they've got between EA sports and the different divisions.
[00:40:58.360 --> 00:41:00.800]   They've got a lot going on.
[00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:03.440]   What else Rock Band, of course, like I mentioned, looks awesome.
[00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:05.720]   There's some RPG games that look pretty cool.
[00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:09.640]   Even I think there was one for PS3 that looks pretty neat as well.
[00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:11.640]   I'm having a hard time remembering all the names,
[00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:14.280]   because they're all running together in my mind right now.
[00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:15.520]   If they run together in your mind,
[00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:18.120]   just imagine how the rest of us feel.
[00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:20.280]   This is just-- it's so sad that what
[00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:25.400]   was a dynamic, vibrant, exciting conference and industry
[00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:27.960]   has just turned into this kind of--
[00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:29.800]   Yeah, there's another Rock Band.
[00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:32.040]   I mean, everything was so spread out.
[00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:34.440]   They had to drive all over the place.
[00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:36.720]   Even the Barker Hangar, which was really
[00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:38.920]   the closest thing to the show floor,
[00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:42.720]   was just little TV screens with the games being demoed.
[00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:44.480]   And there was just no excitement.
[00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:47.240]   There was no real feeling of passion.
[00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:49.320]   And, oh, wow, I can't wait for this thing.
[00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:50.360]   And this other thing.
[00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:52.440]   And it's just like meh.
[00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:54.280]   You know what I'm excited about?
[00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:54.840]   What's that?
[00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:57.320]   Sigbritt Lothberg.
[00:41:57.320 --> 00:41:59.040]   Now, that's exciting.
[00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:02.600]   That's the woman who has the fastest internet connection.
[00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:03.640]   That's absolutely right.
[00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:04.280]   Very good.
[00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:05.040]   You win the prize.
[00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:09.640]   75-year-old woman from Carl Stodd in central Sweden.
[00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:12.080]   For reasons I'm not completely clear about,
[00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:13.880]   now has the fastest internet connection
[00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:16.320]   in the world, 40 gigabits.
[00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:18.000]   Yeah, but you know what she's doing?
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:19.920]   She's going into the left-hand lane
[00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:22.640]   and driving a 56-day.
[00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:24.200]   Her blinkers been in another news.
[00:42:24.200 --> 00:42:26.360]   They just gave an 80-year-old man a Lamborghini.
[00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:27.880]   What's the deal?
[00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:29.840]   Well, her son is actually--
[00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:30.840]   He works at Cisco.
[00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:33.080]   He's using her kind of a proof of concept model
[00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:34.440]   to show that it can be done.
[00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:35.880]   And he set the whole thing up for her.
[00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:39.040]   But it is pretty ironic considering, I mean,
[00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:40.880]   what our speeds are here in the US.
[00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:42.720]   And then there's this one lady over in Sweden
[00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:43.840]   who's like killing us all.
[00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:44.680]   40 gigabits.
[00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:46.560]   Don't want to play World of Warcraft with her.
[00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:48.040]   Cisco contributed the project.
[00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:50.920]   That's her son's company.
[00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:53.840]   But it's the fiber that's making it.
[00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:56.160]   Really, he's just showing off.
[00:42:56.160 --> 00:43:01.440]   He said the most-- actually, Hofstein Johnson,
[00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:04.880]   Jönzen, who was, I guess, with Cisco,
[00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:06.560]   said the most difficult part of the whole project
[00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:09.360]   was installing windows on her PC.
[00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:10.160]   How does that I think get?
[00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:12.400]   What would she use in before?
[00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:14.040]   She wasn't using anything, probably.
[00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:14.680]   Could you do Linux?
[00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:15.520]   She's a Linux.
[00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:17.920]   She's a lead hacker.
[00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:21.000]   If you've got a 40 megabit connection,
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:23.240]   I think we can afford to buy the woman a new computer.
[00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:24.440]   40 gigabit.
[00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:25.160]   Gigabit.
[00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:26.160]   Gigabit, rather than.
[00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:27.400]   Gigabit.
[00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:29.000]   I take 40 megs.
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:30.800]   40 gigs.
[00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:31.600]   Mind me a second.
[00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:32.520]   I don't understand.
[00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:33.000]   40 gig?
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:33.720]   40 gig.
[00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:34.960]   Yeah, dude.
[00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:36.320]   I thought you-- because I was trying to figure that out.
[00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:37.360]   I was like 40--
[00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:38.600]   40 megabits is fast.
[00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:39.760]   I think that you guys--
[00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:42.600]   You can download a two hour movie in five seconds.
[00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:44.920]   Oh, that's the MPAA is going to be knocking at her.
[00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:46.760]   Yeah, you can do next.
[00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:48.560]   Sigurd, who wanted it?
[00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:50.200]   This is the speed.
[00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:50.960]   This please.
[00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:51.720]   It's the grip law.
[00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:53.440]   You hit your heart.
[00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:55.000]   They were saying that they can switch between--
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:56.000]   Or go link to jail.
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.240]   --1,500 HD channels or something like that.
[00:43:58.240 --> 00:43:59.160]   Crazy.
[00:43:59.160 --> 00:43:59.440]   Yeah.
[00:43:59.440 --> 00:43:59.960]   Concurrent.
[00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:01.360]   She's got them-- yeah, she can have current.
[00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:04.680]   I think she's running about 400 torrents right now.
[00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:07.000]   She's cheating 400 torrents.
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   Oh, that's the other story.
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:10.440]   Pirate Bay has now moved into her six-year bedroom.
[00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:10.960]   Yeah.
[00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:13.800]   They're living in her guest room.
[00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:15.320]   Whoa, we like this.
[00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:16.920]   This is good.
[00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:18.080]   So what do you think?
[00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:20.200]   Now, I'm going to ask the CEO here about this one.
[00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:23.160]   Eric Schmidt, talking with reporters at a hotel bar
[00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:24.720]   at the Allen & Company meetings.
[00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:26.280]   You go to the Allen & Company?
[00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:29.240]   That's never a good start to a story, by the way.
[00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:30.040]   No.
[00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:31.480]   Walking to reporters in a bar.
[00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:33.240]   Let's go to the downhill from there.
[00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:34.320]   And it is downhill.
[00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:40.520]   He says, "Adviacom is basically a company built from lawsuits."
[00:44:40.520 --> 00:44:41.840]   Look at their history, he said.
[00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:44.640]   Is this the drunken rambling of a CEO?
[00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:48.320]   I just like the fact that Viacom--
[00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:50.000]   We made the same joke on BOL.
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.560]   We're like, I've got to tell you how about it.
[00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:53.560]   I love you.
[00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:54.360]   I don't know.
[00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:55.360]   They're really hot.
[00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:59.680]   I love Wall Street Journal, and I'm going to kiss you.
[00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:00.600]   You look so--
[00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:01.920]   Are you doing Larry Flint?
[00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:03.080]   Who are you doing there?
[00:45:03.080 --> 00:45:05.280]   I'm doing a drunk Eric Schmidt.
[00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:06.440]   A drunk Eric Schmidt.
[00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:06.920]   I love you, man.
[00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:08.040]   I love you, baby.
[00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:11.480]   And Viacom, you suck.
[00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:13.320]   Let's take it outside.
[00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:14.040]   I'll tell you something.
[00:45:14.040 --> 00:45:16.640]   I'll give you some inside baseball stuff that's interesting.
[00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:19.640]   Michael Moretz had a dinner at his house.
[00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:22.200]   And the guy who runs Sequoia was the investor in YouTube,
[00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:23.240]   Google, and Yahoo.
[00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:24.840]   Nice wrecking.
[00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:25.760]   Yeah, not a better record.
[00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:27.920]   He's an investor in Mahalo as well.
[00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:28.880]   And so he's not done yet.
[00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:31.600]   But he had Mikasami in the room who
[00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:34.360]   was from Adam Films, which was bought by Viacom.
[00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:35.280]   Oh, yeah.
[00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:40.720]   And he is sitting there with the guy who is suing him.
[00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:41.960]   Having dinner.
[00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:43.400]   It's a very weird kind of moment.
[00:45:43.400 --> 00:45:45.120]   I was like, I wonder if anybody else is noticing what's
[00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:46.000]   going on here.
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:48.520]   I'm sure they're very collegial when they meet.
[00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:49.840]   They let the lawyers fortify.
[00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:51.520]   It's all negotiation.
[00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:52.520]   It's all negotiation.
[00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:53.600]   Surprise.
[00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:55.160]   The price will be paid.
[00:45:55.160 --> 00:45:56.840]   And there is traffic.
[00:45:56.840 --> 00:45:59.200]   And it's just all negotiation.
[00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:01.640]   And it'll all be taken care of.
[00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:04.320]   And actually, to be totally honest, I think there
[00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:08.480]   is the way the DMCA is structured.
[00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:11.480]   YouTube is acting within the law.
[00:46:11.480 --> 00:46:12.480]   Are they being fair?
[00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:13.160]   Maybe not.
[00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:14.760]   But they are acting within the law,
[00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:16.160]   which is you have to take stuff down.
[00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:17.920]   They have to take take down requests.
[00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:19.080]   They do what they're supposed to do.
[00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:20.000]   What the problem is--
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:21.520]   What more are they supposed to do?
[00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:26.560]   Don't you think they don't just take down the infringing
[00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:27.160]   content?
[00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:29.200]   They will totally wipe someone's entire--
[00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:30.760]   Well, maybe they're over aggressive.
[00:46:30.760 --> 00:46:32.320]   Yeah, I think that's over aggressive.
[00:46:32.320 --> 00:46:33.600]   They should be doing that.
[00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:36.880]   They will kill your account if you're doing--
[00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:39.520]   From what I understand, they will kill your account if you've
[00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:42.200]   done one bad thing, all 10 go.
[00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:43.120]   But--
[00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:43.560]   Not true.
[00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:44.080]   Not true.
[00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:45.880]   I got at one of these messages myself.
[00:46:45.880 --> 00:46:49.920]   Because when I was at ZDTV, I did a story about Comedy Central
[00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:51.320]   about The Daily Show.
[00:46:51.320 --> 00:46:54.640]   And it was not owned by Comedy Central or The Daily Show.
[00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:57.600]   It was actually technically owned by ZDTV.
[00:46:57.600 --> 00:47:01.040]   But they took it down because it said The Daily Show on it.
[00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:02.040]   All the other--
[00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:03.440]   All the other other other--
[00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:05.840]   Ultimately, I think the problem is, is it
[00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:08.640]   by com is angry with their viewers.
[00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:10.920]   They're not angry with YouTube and Google.
[00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:13.600]   They're angry with their viewers that go to YouTube
[00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:17.040]   instead of going to ComedyCentral.com to watch videos.
[00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:18.400]   Just stupid.
[00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:19.080]   These guys--
[00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:20.080]   That's the girl, really?
[00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:23.680]   The way the DMCA loss is structured and a lot of experience
[00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:27.720]   with it from working at AOL and stuff is if you start looking
[00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:30.720]   at the content and you start doing proactive takedowns,
[00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:32.840]   then you're responsible for everything.
[00:47:32.840 --> 00:47:37.240]   So you take down the one-chappelle clip that you stumble upon.
[00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:38.440]   Now you're an editor.
[00:47:38.440 --> 00:47:39.560]   Now the site is edited.
[00:47:39.560 --> 00:47:42.360]   So you only do it in response to the DMCA that requires.
[00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:43.360]   Exactly.
[00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:45.000]   And the system is so easy to upload.
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:49.120]   And there are so many people doing it that the DMCA doesn't work.
[00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:49.760]   But they're crying out.
[00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:50.480]   And Viacom is crazy.
[00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:53.000]   I mean, they're saying we want Google to become--
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:54.920]   create a filtering system and use it.
[00:47:54.920 --> 00:47:56.080]   And I think you're exactly right.
[00:47:56.080 --> 00:47:57.280]   That's why Google's drawing the line.
[00:47:57.280 --> 00:47:59.080]   They don't want to be in that business.
[00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:00.080]   They don't want to be in--
[00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:03.400]   Viacom's other argument is if someone
[00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:05.880]   posts a clip from the Daily Show up there,
[00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:08.960]   and I put the keyword, the Daily Show in there,
[00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:10.960]   well, that should be first clue that you should be looking
[00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:12.840]   at this darn piece of video.
[00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:16.080]   But no, they let it go up until Viacom says, hey, take it down.
[00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:16.520]   So that's there.
[00:48:16.520 --> 00:48:18.360]   And that's within the letter of the law, though.
[00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:19.320]   Right, right.
[00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:23.160]   The law was intended for ISPs and for people who
[00:48:23.160 --> 00:48:26.240]   were caught in carriers, not for web-based services.
[00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:28.080]   So now you have things like Pounds,
[00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:30.040]   which is going to have this problem very soon
[00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:32.920]   or other people will have this problem who host stuff.
[00:48:32.920 --> 00:48:35.880]   And if the more efficient you host,
[00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:38.320]   the easier it is to get to this content.
[00:48:38.320 --> 00:48:42.400]   So it's efficiency in technology matching up
[00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:44.080]   with inefficiency in law.
[00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:46.520]   And what will happen in that is the marketplace tends
[00:48:46.520 --> 00:48:47.720]   to sort it out.
[00:48:47.720 --> 00:48:49.640]   The marketplace hasn't sorted it out here.
[00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:54.000]   And so you have lawsuits which are a proxy for negotiation.
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:57.600]   So if we just see the lawsuits as negotiation tactics,
[00:48:57.600 --> 00:48:59.080]   all you have here is a big negotiation.
[00:48:59.080 --> 00:48:59.640]   Makes sense.
[00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:00.280]   Makes perfect sense.
[00:49:00.280 --> 00:49:02.560]   Well, Viacom needs to come up with a better solution,
[00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:04.080]   which they haven't done.
[00:49:04.080 --> 00:49:07.120]   And what happens isn't like in the case with the Napster thing,
[00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:09.440]   when you shut down Napster, then somebody else
[00:49:09.440 --> 00:49:11.040]   who's got a little bit more wear with all,
[00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:14.240]   like, say, Steve Jobs, pretty much defines a music industry
[00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:15.400]   at 99 cents a song.
[00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:18.160]   So what's going to happen is someone
[00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:20.640]   with a little bit more wear with all will define the video
[00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:22.680]   industry and it's not going to be Viacom.
[00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:25.760]   All these guys are going to have all of their stuff online
[00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:27.240]   with advertising around it.
[00:49:27.240 --> 00:49:30.320]   And so when they have their stuff,
[00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:31.760]   Google will probably settle with them,
[00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:34.160]   or Google will send them some traffic.
[00:49:34.160 --> 00:49:35.640]   All kinds of interesting settlements
[00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:36.160]   that could go on.
[00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:38.640]   Remember when AOL, Microsoft and Netscape
[00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:40.120]   were having their whole dance.
[00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:44.560]   Microsoft paid AOL and Time 1 are a couple of billion dollars.
[00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:48.760]   AOL previously got the AOL client on the Microsoft desktop.
[00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:51.800]   Microsoft got AOL to use IES at the fall browser,
[00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:53.200]   even though they own Netscape.
[00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:56.600]   All kinds of weird negotiations and things could happen.
[00:49:56.600 --> 00:49:59.280]   You might see Viacom say, you know what?
[00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:01.760]   YouTube is now going to be the official host to our content
[00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:04.520]   because Google's giving us a billion dollars
[00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:05.800]   over the next three years.
[00:50:05.800 --> 00:50:07.600]   That's where the negotiation is happening.
[00:50:07.600 --> 00:50:08.800]   I think it's just a dollar amount.
[00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:10.760]   What's unfortunate is that the people who are never
[00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:13.360]   at the table are we users.
[00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:15.960]   And so all this will be decided without us.
[00:50:15.960 --> 00:50:18.840]   The good news is ultimately the power resides in our hand
[00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:21.640]   as Viacom and Google are learning.
[00:50:21.640 --> 00:50:22.640]   And I will hope--
[00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:24.800]   We are the people of the year, if you read Time 2.
[00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:26.600]   It's us, baby.
[00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:31.480]   So I bet you had fun on Buzz out loud with Wabi Sabi Lobby.
[00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:32.280]   Did you?
[00:50:32.280 --> 00:50:32.680]   Yes.
[00:50:32.680 --> 00:50:34.200]   WabiSabi Lobby.com.
[00:50:34.200 --> 00:50:37.600]   It is a site where there--
[00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:39.080]   Swiss internet startup.
[00:50:39.080 --> 00:50:42.080]   You got to love-- you got to love their guts
[00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:46.880]   where they're auctioning off exploits, eBay style.
[00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:47.400]   Right.
[00:50:47.400 --> 00:50:51.040]   And it's supposed to-- it's going to help for security things
[00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:52.320]   if they sell them to the right people.
[00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:52.680]   Well, yeah.
[00:50:52.680 --> 00:50:55.120]   Can't I as a hacker or a bad guy come along and say,
[00:50:55.120 --> 00:50:56.640]   oh, I'd like to bid for that one.
[00:50:56.640 --> 00:50:59.240]   When you go to the top dollar, then--
[00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:00.240]   I don't really remember--
[00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:01.600]   Top dollar lowest dollar.
[00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:02.800]   How does it work?
[00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:04.960]   No, it's a eBay style auction site.
[00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:06.640]   So I go WabiSabi Lobby.
[00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:09.480]   I go on WabiSabi Lobby.com and say, well,
[00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:15.560]   I figured out a way to inject a bad piece of Trojan horse
[00:51:15.560 --> 00:51:18.600]   software on somebody's system by having them come to this site
[00:51:18.600 --> 00:51:19.600]   using this exploit.
[00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:21.000]   How much would you pay for that?
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:22.680]   And then they bid it up.
[00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:23.720]   And then whoever gets it gets to use it.
[00:51:23.720 --> 00:51:24.960]   But most people are researchers.
[00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:25.320]   Yeah.
[00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:27.640]   Or it's researchers that put up the exploits, right?
[00:51:27.640 --> 00:51:28.600]   Right.
[00:51:28.600 --> 00:51:30.080]   And then it can either go to people
[00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:33.280]   who are going to exploit that information, or people who
[00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:35.600]   are going to use it to defend.
[00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:36.680]   What's that?
[00:51:36.680 --> 00:51:37.680]   I thought it was to fix it.
[00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:40.080]   And so whoever gives the lowest bid,
[00:51:40.080 --> 00:51:41.600]   they'll give a quarter of that--
[00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:43.080]   According to the company, they are
[00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:45.160]   going to screen sellers and buyers
[00:51:45.160 --> 00:51:48.360]   requiring proof of identification, articles of incorporation,
[00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:49.880]   and bank account information.
[00:51:49.880 --> 00:51:51.280]   This has been going on for a long time.
[00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:54.160]   I mean, the guys from 2600, their bread and butter
[00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:56.800]   was getting paid to crack systems on Wall Street.
[00:51:56.800 --> 00:51:59.760]   And this is just a marketplace for doing that.
[00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:01.600]   So it's actually nothing new.
[00:52:01.600 --> 00:52:04.400]   What's new about it is they're being transparent.
[00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:05.560]   There was going to be--
[00:52:05.560 --> 00:52:07.240]   They had black hats to do this for a long time.
[00:52:07.240 --> 00:52:08.080]   Sure.
[00:52:08.080 --> 00:52:08.400]   Sure.
[00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:11.440]   But also, the whole sort of network of virus creation
[00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:15.120]   is becoming more transparent in general, isn't it?
[00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:16.640]   I mean, in that--
[00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:17.160]   Yes.
[00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:19.640]   People are becoming more aware of how it's being created.
[00:52:19.640 --> 00:52:23.360]   And in two ways, A, it allows viruses to be created better.
[00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:25.720]   But at the same time, it allows the people who
[00:52:25.720 --> 00:52:28.400]   are defending and attacking the viruses to get at them better.
[00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:30.120]   And to make money at it, too.
[00:52:30.120 --> 00:52:30.640]   If you're a good--
[00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:31.160]   Right.
[00:52:31.160 --> 00:52:33.640]   --researcher, now you could sell your research.
[00:52:33.640 --> 00:52:37.360]   Yeah, both industries are taken off.
[00:52:37.360 --> 00:52:38.480]   It's interesting.
[00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:40.680]   I mean, I guess if they do a good job,
[00:52:40.680 --> 00:52:42.200]   and I don't know how good a job you can do,
[00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:45.320]   of validating the buyers, then this is fine.
[00:52:45.320 --> 00:52:45.600]   Right.
[00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:47.120]   What's on there's that whole--
[00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:48.840]   are you really sure you're validating the buyers?
[00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:49.680]   Well, that's my problem.
[00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:51.240]   And imagine the people you're selling, too.
[00:52:51.240 --> 00:52:52.560]   Right.
[00:52:52.560 --> 00:52:54.000]   I love these kind of ideas.
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:58.440]   Like I was thinking all these SEOs are trying to spam
[00:52:58.440 --> 00:52:59.040]   Mahalo.
[00:52:59.040 --> 00:53:01.600]   And so I was thinking about putting a reward out there
[00:53:01.600 --> 00:53:03.640]   of $100 or something like that.
[00:53:03.640 --> 00:53:05.840]   Every time a user found a spam link.
[00:53:05.840 --> 00:53:06.720]   It's a great idea.
[00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:09.640]   It'd be cheaper than us policing it.
[00:53:09.640 --> 00:53:10.320]   That's a great idea.
[00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:11.400]   Yeah, give me an iPhone.
[00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:12.400]   Give me an iPhone.
[00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:14.200]   Yeah, a couple of friends.
[00:53:14.200 --> 00:53:18.040]   I'm giving away 100 iPhones to the part-time guides.
[00:53:18.040 --> 00:53:18.680]   Oh, that's nice.
[00:53:18.680 --> 00:53:19.240]   We're working on it.
[00:53:19.240 --> 00:53:19.680]   Yeah.
[00:53:19.680 --> 00:53:20.440]   That's really nice.
[00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:20.440]   So what?
[00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:21.440]   Really?
[00:53:21.440 --> 00:53:21.940]   Uh-oh.
[00:53:21.940 --> 00:53:23.440]   Yeah, I didn't publicize it except for here,
[00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:25.120]   but we're the 100 part-time--
[00:53:25.120 --> 00:53:25.620]   First?
[00:53:25.620 --> 00:53:27.560]   Yeah, go and hear about it now.
[00:53:27.560 --> 00:53:29.520]   Veronica, Veronica, you can have--
[00:53:29.520 --> 00:53:30.880]   Why does this video thing or--
[00:53:30.880 --> 00:53:32.000]   She's already got one.
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:33.480]   She's already got one.
[00:53:33.480 --> 00:53:34.480]   Veronica, I told you.
[00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:36.640]   I told you, any hardware you need,
[00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:39.480]   you can have any toys you need.
[00:53:39.480 --> 00:53:42.760]   Now I know why you made the deal, Veronica.
[00:53:42.760 --> 00:53:44.840]   I am the greatest guy to talent ever.
[00:53:44.840 --> 00:53:46.600]   Yeah, I know you have a good reputation.
[00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:47.960]   Oh my god, that's great.
[00:53:47.960 --> 00:53:48.720]   I know what they need.
[00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:52.360]   This is the 25th anniversary of the computer virus, by the way.
[00:53:52.360 --> 00:53:56.240]   Science Magazine documented it in 1982,
[00:53:56.240 --> 00:53:58.160]   previous before the Morris Worm, which
[00:53:58.160 --> 00:54:00.360]   was the first one I was aware of in 1988.
[00:54:00.360 --> 00:54:03.040]   In 1982, the first computer virus was elk,
[00:54:03.040 --> 00:54:05.600]   cloner, a Pittsburgh high school student,
[00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:07.480]   wrote it, spread through Apple II systems
[00:54:07.480 --> 00:54:10.000]   via infected floppy disks.
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:13.760]   And it's payload, bad poetry.
[00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:14.760]   Ouch, like black and black.
[00:54:14.760 --> 00:54:16.360]   Oh, simpler days.
[00:54:16.360 --> 00:54:17.360]   I don't know.
[00:54:17.360 --> 00:54:17.560]   I don't know.
[00:54:17.560 --> 00:54:20.160]   I think I'd rather have my hard drive.
[00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:22.920]   I wish they had examples in science of the bad poetry.
[00:54:22.920 --> 00:54:24.920]   I would have loved to have read it.
[00:54:24.920 --> 00:54:27.520]   What are you going to do to celebrate the anniversary, Leo?
[00:54:27.520 --> 00:54:28.240]   Oh, I don't know.
[00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:28.880]   What should I do?
[00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:29.560]   What would be good?
[00:54:29.560 --> 00:54:33.000]   I remember maybe take Norton anti-virus out to get drunk.
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:36.360]   Yeah, maybe it'll say something nasty about Viacom.
[00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:38.440]   Does that mean it's the 26th anniversary of Windows?
[00:54:38.440 --> 00:54:40.760]   It was the 25th anniversary of the virus.
[00:54:40.760 --> 00:54:43.480]   It was an Apple II virus, Jason.
[00:54:43.480 --> 00:54:47.120]   Interestingly enough, I remember Michael
[00:54:47.120 --> 00:54:50.440]   Angelo, Devorak and I were doing a radio show in the early 90s.
[00:54:50.440 --> 00:54:51.560]   I think it was 91 or 92.
[00:54:51.560 --> 00:54:55.080]   And then Michael Angelo was the first really big virus.
[00:54:55.080 --> 00:54:55.520]   I remember it.
[00:54:55.520 --> 00:54:56.680]   Yeah, boot sector virus.
[00:54:56.680 --> 00:54:59.800]   You'd get it by trying to boot from a floppy that had the virus on it.
[00:54:59.800 --> 00:55:01.440]   And I remember--
[00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:03.920]   What was the virus from the movie hackers?
[00:55:03.920 --> 00:55:05.320]   Is that Da Vinci?
[00:55:05.320 --> 00:55:05.920]   Did they call it Da Vinci?
[00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:06.800]   I don't remember that.
[00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:08.200]   Maybe that was based on the same thing.
[00:55:08.200 --> 00:55:09.520]   Yeah, I think it was based on Da Vinci.
[00:55:09.520 --> 00:55:10.120]   Interesting.
[00:55:10.120 --> 00:55:10.640]   Yeah.
[00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:11.840]   I'm not-- I can't remember.
[00:55:11.840 --> 00:55:13.040]   That just popped into my head.
[00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:16.440]   There was a simple fix program that you could get on floppy,
[00:55:16.440 --> 00:55:17.520]   download, put it on floppy books.
[00:55:17.520 --> 00:55:20.240]   Because this was early before the internet was widespread.
[00:55:20.240 --> 00:55:22.080]   I remember offering on the radio show
[00:55:22.080 --> 00:55:23.720]   as a syndicated radio show.
[00:55:23.720 --> 00:55:25.680]   Anybody who wanted a disk, I would send them one.
[00:55:25.680 --> 00:55:27.040]   And I got thousands of requests.
[00:55:27.040 --> 00:55:28.600]   I ended up getting a disk duplicator.
[00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:33.040]   It's spending hours making these disks.
[00:55:33.040 --> 00:55:33.960]   Well, what else?
[00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:34.920]   There's another anniversary.
[00:55:34.920 --> 00:55:36.120]   It's a 25th anniversary.
[00:55:36.120 --> 00:55:38.720]   I'm trying to remember there was another anniversary.
[00:55:38.720 --> 00:55:40.120]   Veronica?
[00:55:40.120 --> 00:55:41.200]   Is it your anniversary?
[00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:42.520]   She's next weekend.
[00:55:42.520 --> 00:55:44.320]   Happy anniversary, Veronica.
[00:55:44.320 --> 00:55:44.840]   Thanks.
[00:55:44.840 --> 00:55:46.040]   I'm being on the planet.
[00:55:46.040 --> 00:55:46.800]   Of being alive.
[00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:48.400]   Oh, happy birthday.
[00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:48.920]   Thank you.
[00:55:48.920 --> 00:55:50.000]   I'm a good clan.
[00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:51.120]   No, that's a good one.
[00:55:51.120 --> 00:55:52.440]   It wasn't the one I was thinking of,
[00:55:52.440 --> 00:55:54.920]   but it's probably better than the one I was thinking of.
[00:55:54.920 --> 00:55:57.560]   It was the fifth-- oh, it's the 10th anniversary of the blog.
[00:55:57.560 --> 00:55:58.200]   That's what it was.
[00:55:58.200 --> 00:55:59.720]   And of course, it's not till December,
[00:55:59.720 --> 00:56:01.120]   but the Wall Street Journal's written about it
[00:56:01.120 --> 00:56:03.600]   so that makes it official.
[00:56:03.600 --> 00:56:05.120]   They highlighted right-wing bloggers.
[00:56:05.120 --> 00:56:06.480]   I thought that was kind of interesting.
[00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:07.240]   That story was whack.
[00:56:07.240 --> 00:56:08.360]   I opened that up yesterday.
[00:56:08.360 --> 00:56:08.880]   I was like, what?
[00:56:08.880 --> 00:56:10.600]   And I looked and it was like--
[00:56:10.600 --> 00:56:11.320]   It was whack.
[00:56:11.320 --> 00:56:13.560]   Two pages, two full pages with pictures.
[00:56:13.560 --> 00:56:15.040]   There was no bloggers commenting.
[00:56:15.040 --> 00:56:18.600]   It was like they had like whatever the guy Thomas Wolf
[00:56:18.600 --> 00:56:19.480]   or whatever commenting was.
[00:56:19.480 --> 00:56:20.320]   A Tom Wolf.
[00:56:20.320 --> 00:56:20.920]   Yeah, say--
[00:56:20.920 --> 00:56:23.120]   Everybody commenting who doesn't have a blog.
[00:56:23.120 --> 00:56:25.720]   It's like Tom Wolf says blogs will never go anywhere.
[00:56:25.720 --> 00:56:26.760]   Ah, New York's--
[00:56:26.760 --> 00:56:26.800]   New York's--
[00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:27.880]   --special arc blog.
[00:56:27.880 --> 00:56:30.440]   Yeah, but the term-- the term blog is in 10 years old.
[00:56:30.440 --> 00:56:32.840]   I mean, there have been online diaries for plenty of time.
[00:56:32.840 --> 00:56:33.360]   But the--
[00:56:33.360 --> 00:56:34.160]   Right, Justin Hall's--
[00:56:34.160 --> 00:56:34.360]   --how old's--
[00:56:34.360 --> 00:56:34.840]   --term blog.
[00:56:34.840 --> 00:56:35.760]   Justin, that's right.
[00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:36.360]   Justin Hall.
[00:56:36.360 --> 00:56:37.680]   Justin Hall, 1995.
[00:56:37.680 --> 00:56:39.920]   Anybody see the movie homepage?
[00:56:39.920 --> 00:56:40.360]   No.
[00:56:40.360 --> 00:56:41.480]   Nobody see the movie homepage.
[00:56:41.480 --> 00:56:42.880]   Justin Hall.
[00:56:42.880 --> 00:56:44.320]   He worked at CDC.
[00:56:44.320 --> 00:56:45.320]   He worked--
[00:56:45.320 --> 00:56:45.840]   And he also--
[00:56:45.840 --> 00:56:46.040]   No, he did.
[00:56:46.040 --> 00:56:46.680]   But we had him on--
[00:56:46.680 --> 00:56:47.200]   --for help.
[00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:48.480]   I remember having him on--
[00:56:48.480 --> 00:56:51.040]   in fact, there was full frontal male nudity on his website.
[00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:51.240]   And I thought--
[00:56:51.240 --> 00:56:52.440]   I know, that was awesome.
[00:56:52.440 --> 00:56:54.760]   Yeah, I never forget that.
[00:56:54.760 --> 00:57:00.000]   He was the first journalist, as in journal person,
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:01.000]   person who ran a journal.
[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:04.640]   And he had a movie made about him called homepage.
[00:57:04.640 --> 00:57:08.680]   And it was about him teaching kids how to do HTML
[00:57:08.680 --> 00:57:11.880]   in order to create their own journals
[00:57:11.880 --> 00:57:14.080]   and tell their stories about their life.
[00:57:14.080 --> 00:57:15.640]   So really, this is as old as the web.
[00:57:15.640 --> 00:57:17.120]   To say it's 10 years old is absurd.
[00:57:17.120 --> 00:57:19.840]   Justin Hall was absolutely the first blogger,
[00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:21.400]   although it was not called a blogger.
[00:57:21.400 --> 00:57:23.280]   And that was in 1994 and '95.
[00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:25.920]   This is before the web had backgrounds.
[00:57:25.920 --> 00:57:26.260]   Right.
[00:57:26.260 --> 00:57:28.640]   You know, back then, when he was doing that teaching,
[00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:32.720]   he actually said he would go anywhere to teach,
[00:57:32.720 --> 00:57:35.240]   as long as he got a bus ticket and a couch to sleep on.
[00:57:35.240 --> 00:57:35.600]   I remember.
[00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:37.640]   That was, I think, his only form of pain.
[00:57:37.640 --> 00:57:38.800]   He was a kid, too, then.
[00:57:38.800 --> 00:57:39.320]   I mean, he was--
[00:57:39.320 --> 00:57:39.840]   Yeah.
[00:57:39.840 --> 00:57:40.680]   He was in college.
[00:57:40.680 --> 00:57:43.240]   He was 20 years old, 19, 20 years old.
[00:57:43.240 --> 00:57:46.040]   Well, happy anniversary to the blog whenever.
[00:57:46.040 --> 00:57:47.600]   25th anniversary of the virus.
[00:57:47.600 --> 00:57:49.080]   I'm sure there's a virus predates that.
[00:57:49.080 --> 00:57:51.280]   That'll make that mood as well.
[00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:53.000]   I do thank you guys for joining us.
[00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:54.000]   It's really been great.
[00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:54.640]   What a great panel.
[00:57:54.640 --> 00:57:56.960]   David Spark, you don't want me to give a plug
[00:57:56.960 --> 00:57:57.800]   to your old site.
[00:57:57.800 --> 00:57:59.120]   You've got some new sites.
[00:57:59.120 --> 00:57:59.160]   No sites.
[00:57:59.160 --> 00:58:02.440]   Sparkminute.com or sparkmediasolutions.com.
[00:58:02.440 --> 00:58:05.800]   And those are the places to find more sparkle in your life.
[00:58:05.800 --> 00:58:06.240]   There you go.
[00:58:06.240 --> 00:58:07.440]   So great to talk to you again.
[00:58:07.440 --> 00:58:10.080]   And we'll get you back many, many times on Twitter.
[00:58:10.080 --> 00:58:11.040]   And I want to make you a regular.
[00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:12.360]   Same thing with you, Jason.
[00:58:12.360 --> 00:58:14.120]   You've redeemed yourself.
[00:58:14.120 --> 00:58:17.600]   You are not the blood-sucking vampire demon
[00:58:17.600 --> 00:58:19.640]   others have claimed.
[00:58:19.640 --> 00:58:24.000]   Why you're just a mild man or an entrepreneurial guy.
[00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:25.000]   So you think.
[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:26.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:58:26.360 --> 00:58:27.600]   So I like you to believe--
[00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:29.560]   I'm never playing Texas Hold 'em with you.
[00:58:29.560 --> 00:58:30.760]   I'll tell you that right now.
[00:58:30.760 --> 00:58:32.560]   That's a good thing that he's not a vampire
[00:58:32.560 --> 00:58:35.520]   because my family has a history of killing vampires.
[00:58:35.520 --> 00:58:36.400]   Really?
[00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:37.600]   Is that true?
[00:58:37.600 --> 00:58:38.320]   Yeah.
[00:58:38.320 --> 00:58:38.840]   I didn't know that.
[00:58:38.840 --> 00:58:39.840]   In California.
[00:58:39.840 --> 00:58:40.340]   Yeah.
[00:58:40.340 --> 00:58:42.240]   Oh, in Castlevania.
[00:58:42.240 --> 00:58:43.480]   Callicannas.com.
[00:58:43.480 --> 00:58:46.000]   That's the home of the Callicannascast and also
[00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:50.560]   the iPhone contest in Mahalo because you could win one too.
[00:58:50.560 --> 00:58:53.920]   Callicannasca-l-a-c-a-n-i-s.com.
[00:58:53.920 --> 00:58:56.640]   And I'm going to give you one more one last plug, Veronica,
[00:58:56.640 --> 00:58:58.920]   for b-o-l-dot-c-net.com.
[00:58:58.920 --> 00:59:00.960]   From now on, it's Tom Merritt and Molly Woodell
[00:59:00.960 --> 00:59:03.880]   have to come on a plug buzz out loud.
[00:59:03.880 --> 00:59:05.440]   You'll be on Mahalo.
[00:59:05.440 --> 00:59:07.320]   Yeah, and you can find all my personal blog
[00:59:07.320 --> 00:59:09.000]   at veronicabellmont.com.
[00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:09.440]   Yeah.
[00:59:09.440 --> 00:59:11.760]   I always know when somebody's about to leave their job
[00:59:11.760 --> 00:59:15.240]   because they start plugging their personal blog.
[00:59:15.240 --> 00:59:16.640]   Find more information there.
[00:59:16.640 --> 00:59:18.360]   That's always a sign.
[00:59:18.360 --> 00:59:20.520]   I think, Jason, you made a very good move, Veronica.
[00:59:20.520 --> 00:59:21.800]   It's absolutely a superstar.
[00:59:21.800 --> 00:59:23.520]   And I can't wait to see what she does on Mahalo.
[00:59:23.520 --> 00:59:25.400]   So when does that start?
[00:59:25.400 --> 00:59:28.520]   Hopefully, and in August, I still got some time
[00:59:28.520 --> 00:59:30.560]   going to figure out where I'm shooting from here in San
[00:59:30.560 --> 00:59:31.080]   Francisco.
[00:59:31.080 --> 00:59:31.560]   You'll be up here.
[00:59:31.560 --> 00:59:32.520]   You'll stay up here, I hope.
[00:59:32.520 --> 00:59:32.880]   Oh, yeah.
[00:59:32.880 --> 00:59:34.320]   I'm totally staying in San Francisco.
[00:59:34.320 --> 00:59:34.800]   Yeah.
[00:59:34.800 --> 00:59:37.240]   But I'll be down in Santa Monica quite a bit as well.
[00:59:37.240 --> 00:59:40.200]   That's where the Kawakanis Cast Studios are.
[00:59:40.200 --> 00:59:40.720]   Yes.
[00:59:40.720 --> 00:59:41.960]   I know offices.
[00:59:41.960 --> 00:59:44.560]   And we're thrilled to have Veronica here with us.
[00:59:44.560 --> 00:59:45.600]   I'm very excited about it.
[00:59:45.600 --> 00:59:46.200]   Yeah.
[00:59:46.200 --> 00:59:46.800]   Thank you guys.
[00:59:46.800 --> 00:59:47.720]   Appreciate it.
[00:59:47.720 --> 00:59:51.120]   Oh, I forgot to mention our Audible Book of the Week.
[00:59:51.120 --> 00:59:53.520]   Any of you do Audible.com?
[00:59:53.520 --> 00:59:54.360]   I do sometimes.
[00:59:54.360 --> 00:59:55.560]   I love Audible.com.
[00:59:55.560 --> 00:59:57.400]   I've done Audible many times.
[00:59:57.400 --> 01:00:00.600]   They are a sponsor of actually most of the network now
[01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:02.600]   and offer a free book to anybody who's not yet
[01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:05.480]   an Audible member at audible.com/twit.
[01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:08.080]   I'm going to recommend a book called Shadow Divers.
[01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:09.320]   Somebody reminded me of this.
[01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:09.760]   I got it.
[01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:10.640]   Great, great book.
[01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:11.600]   Isn't that awesome?
[01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:12.960]   I bought it on Audible.
[01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:14.320]   Isn't that awesome?
[01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:17.240]   It is the greatest audio book.
[01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:22.000]   I never had the book, but Shadow Divers told by the guy
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:23.080]   who wrote the book.
[01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:24.720]   Amazing.
[01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:27.280]   Anthony Sheefer sent me an email reminding me about this.
[01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:28.640]   And Anthony, I thank you.
[01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:30.880]   It was one of my favorite Audible Books ever.
[01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:34.280]   It's about deep sea divers and their recovery
[01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:38.360]   of a German submarine, a U-boat that had been lost,
[01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:40.080]   but nobody knew about.
[01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:41.840]   And they discovered it off the coast of New England.
[01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:43.920]   That's a fascinating story.
[01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:47.000]   True story, chills and thrills and a great rate.
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:48.480]   It is a wonderful audio book.
[01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:51.320]   You're really right there.
[01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:52.760]   That is Shadow Divers.
[01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:54.560]   It is our book of the week.
[01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:58.040]   You can get a free copy of that or any book Audible offers.
[01:00:58.040 --> 01:01:00.000]   If you're in the US, there are some limitations.
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:04.240]   If you're outside the US, but do check Audible.com/twit.
[01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:06.400]   Do a little search there.
[01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:07.600]   And you'll see which books you can get.
[01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:09.000]   And you get a free book.
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:10.680]   And we do thank Audible for their support.
[01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:11.640]   It's a great service.
[01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:13.840]   If you've never done a book on tape, try this free one
[01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:15.160]   because you'll see why we love it.
[01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:18.160]   If you listen to podcasts, you're a natural Audible listener.
[01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:21.920]   Audible.com and Shadow Divers.
[01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:23.960]   Highly awesome.
[01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:28.440]   This book, I like for two or three flights.
[01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:29.760]   I just listened to it because that's a great thing
[01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:30.280]   about Audible.
[01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:30.880]   You download it.
[01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:32.000]   You got it on your thing.
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:33.200]   And then when you're on a flight,
[01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:36.160]   you've listened to your Jay-Z album for the 12,000th time.
[01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:38.160]   You've listened to it all.
[01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:40.360]   No, and this book is riveting.
[01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:42.880]   And the guy who does the voiceover on it is awesome.
[01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:46.360]   And it's definitely one of the five best audiobooks
[01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:46.800]   I've listened to.
[01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:48.160]   I've probably listened to over 100.
[01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:49.000]   Yeah.
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.160]   Robert Kerson is the author and Michael Pritchard reads it.
[01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:53.760]   And he's one of the Audible's best readers.
[01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:54.320]   He's really--
[01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:54.960]   Great.
[01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:55.520]   Really great.
[01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:56.120]   Well, I'm glad to--
[01:01:56.120 --> 01:01:57.240]   The comedian Michael Pritchard?
[01:01:57.240 --> 01:01:58.320]   No, it's not that much.
[01:01:58.320 --> 01:02:00.080]   You know, it's funny because Michael Pritchard,
[01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:01.320]   I think it's spelled differently.
[01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:03.640]   But I think Michael Pritchard does do some books.
[01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:05.240]   He's very funny.
[01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:05.760]   The comedian.
[01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:06.520]   The comedian.
[01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:07.960]   But this is a different Michael Pritchard
[01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:09.600]   who does a lot of Audible stuff.
[01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:10.840]   And he's really--
[01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:11.880]   I agree with you, Jason.
[01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:14.040]   He's, I think, my favorite reader on Audible.
[01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:14.880]   Anyway, that enough of that.
[01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:16.080]   Audible.com/twit.
[01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:16.880]   And thank you all.
[01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:20.480]   We do have some Twit hoodies for sale on the website, twit.tv.
[01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:21.280]   It supports Twit.
[01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:24.880]   And they're from ThinkGeek and the great folks at Scott Evest.
[01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:26.880]   In fact, as participants in the show today,
[01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:29.160]   I'll be glad to send each and every one of you your very own
[01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:30.560]   Twit fleece hoodie.
[01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:34.600]   It's a way of thanking you for playing our game.
[01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:39.040]   Invite everybody else to pay for it at twit.tv.
[01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:39.680]   Thank you, guys.
[01:02:39.680 --> 01:02:40.280]   Another Twit.
[01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:41.520]   This is amazing.
[01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:42.160]   Is it the can?
[01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:44.800]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:51.000]   Gia, print magazine in trouble.
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:51.920]   How would you guess that?
[01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:53.920]   Yeah, I'm working.
[01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:55.680]   OK, I mean, I would never go back to print.
[01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:58.200]   Although, the whole way the AOL deal
[01:02:58.200 --> 01:03:02.000]   with Weblog Zinc went down was because I was meeting
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:03.080]   with Time Magazine.
[01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:04.440]   Oh, really?
[01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:05.880]   Because I was trying to pitch them on doing an
[01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:07.280]   Engagic Quarterland--
[01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:08.840]   Oh, interesting.
[01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:12.360]   And I wanted them to give us a couple million dollars a
[01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:16.960]   year to do a gabbling or travel blog as a MOOC, a magazine
[01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:19.000]   book like--
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:19.600]   or Riley did.
[01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:22.240]   It was funny because he had the same idea I had, which was,
[01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:25.000]   I had always been buying these graphic novels or looking
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.440]   at those Japanese magazines for cars.
[01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:29.120]   And I would give them to the bloggers and say, hey, check
[01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:29.600]   this out.
[01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:31.040]   There's got to be some good content in here.
[01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:33.960]   You got all those crazy stuff that's in this Japanese MOOC.
[01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:34.480]   You know?
[01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:35.480]   All right.
[01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:37.400]   Doing the Twit, baby.
[01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:38.200]   Doing the Twit.
[01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:39.200]   All right.
[01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:41.120]   Doing the Twit, baby.
[01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:41.920]   Doing the Twit.
[01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:42.920]   All right.
[01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:44.840]   Doing the Twit, baby.
[01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:45.640]   Doing the Twit.
[01:03:45.640 --> 01:03:46.640]   All right.
[01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:48.480]   Doing the Twit, baby.
