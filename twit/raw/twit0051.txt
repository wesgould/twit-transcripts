[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.920]   bandwidth for Twit.TV podcasts is provided by AOL Radio at AOL.com/podcasting.
[00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:15.920]   This is Twit, this week in tech, episode 51 for April 23, 2006.
[00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:41.920]   [Music]
[00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:48.280]   Our first episode of our second year, actually, because I missed, I
[00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.680]   miss counted and I didn't realize that April 18th was the, or 17th was the
[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:58.280]   anniversary of Twit, episode one. And on episode one of Twit, I'm going to go back
[00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.520]   and look at Twit.TV/1. I will tell you who was on episode one of Twit. It was
[00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:10.960]   Patrick, Kevin, Robert Heron, and me. And guess who's on episode 51 of Twit?
[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.240]   Kevin, Robert, and me. And Patrick is being played by David Prager.
[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.880]   Hey, I was on episode zero, man. You were on zero. And Alex Lindsey is really the new
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.200]   bee here. Hey, Alex, welcome. I think that Patrick may join us. He's actually on his
[00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.480]   way to Vegas for the NAB Conference of National Association of Broadcasters,
[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.880]   which now that we're all internet casters has suddenly become much more
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.400]   important to us than it used to be. The first thing I want to talk about, we'll get
[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.680]   to NAB in a little bit and Patrick will join us and talk about it because he's
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.760]   there at the Flamingo. But I think we should start off with Kevin Rose because
[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.560]   you were in the news this week. Oh, it was all over the place. You all about dig.
[00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:57.760]   That's right. So lots of digs being taken at dig. People complaining about lack of
[00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:04.440]   transparency and how stories make it to the front page. People are alleging that
[00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.800]   you're doing stuff. Where did it start? Was CNET? Who was it the first?
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:17.560]   Well, it started with a blog that posted an entry about a spammer that had been
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.960]   posting stories to dig. This is forever for ever geek. Right, forever geek. And
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.160]   there was two stories that made it on the homepage from a website called A List
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.640]   Apart, which is an amazing website. Both of those stories I dug and I was the
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.880]   17th digger on both stories. So they thought because of the order in which all
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.120]   of the digs were happening that I was a part of this like ring or bot that was
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:46.760]   actually digging these stories. People are so conspiracy oriented. Well, it's, well,
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.680]   it kind of, I can see where they're coming from though because if you look at the
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.480]   actual history, because if you go into dig and you go into any story and then you
[00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.840]   go down to the very bottom is it lists all the diggers and what order that they
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.160]   were dug in, you can see that this person was clearly using a bot to dig all the
[00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.480]   stories because it would rapid dig at 16 different accounts. So this is the
[00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.200]   spammer that you're talking about. This is a very, very common way that we see
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.400]   happen all the time on dig. They're trying to game dig by using a bot. Like the
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.120]   biggest, the number one thing that we have to do at dig right now is fight spam
[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.960]   on a daily basis. We are constantly, constantly fighting spam. The reason is
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:27.240]   if you get dig on dig, if you rise up on dig, people, you got a lot of clicks.
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:31.680]   Yeah, it's a ton of traffic. So it's like instant traffic to your website. But what
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.720]   the person really didn't point out is that this person was also listed as one
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.520]   of my friends. Actually three of their accounts were listed as my friends because
[00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:45.480]   I track a bunch of different people on dig. I have about 40 different people that I
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.520]   track through the friend's feature that's built into the site. And you're tracking
[00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.640]   them though, not because he's a friend may not be the best name because you're
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.080]   tracking them because you're trying to keep an eye on them.
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:00.400]   You like their stories and they submit good stuff. So these accounts, so spamming
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.400]   is kind of evolved on the site. So basically there's several different ways
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.040]   that people can spam the site. There's the people that will sign up for a mass
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.480]   account. So they'll come in, they'll create 50 different accounts and their main
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:16.360]   goal is to all dig the same story and get their blog or their website or their
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:22.000]   story on the front page. So that doesn't work because we've kind of put in a
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.720]   karma system behind the scenes. This was a long time ago, like a year and a half
[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.600]   ago, right about a year ago we added a karma system behind the scenes. It kind
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.240]   of takes a look, kind of creates a baseline of all the different digging
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.440]   activity that's done on the site. And then we can very easily tell when someone
[00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:41.200]   is a spammer or just creating fake accounts or is all behind the same IP
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:47.320]   is behind one of the many, many anonymous proxies that are out there or you know
[00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.600]   we'll see the same URL that's getting reported by users submitted over and
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.280]   over again. So that's the old way of spamming the site. Now the new way that
[00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.920]   we've seen in the last probably, I don't know, 60, 90 days is when you have
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:06.080]   people that are submitting quality content to create these like fake accounts
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:12.520]   that appear to be real. So you'll see sites that will or spammers that will
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.120]   create and submit, you know, a couple dozen stories that are actually quality
[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.440]   stories. Some will make the homepage, some won't, and then they'll somehow get in
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.120]   there with their own unique URL and try and promote it that way. Well that's
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.720]   makes sense. So then it doesn't look like it's the same guy over and over.
[00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.120]   Right. And it's very hard for our systems to detect that kind of stuff
[00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.280]   because obviously if they're using unique IPs, if they're not behind proxies
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:39.920]   that we can detect, it's hard to really kind of put, it's hard to detect when
[00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:46.640]   users are kind of digging together. Is it the patterns? Is it the same people
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:52.800]   who are doing the Fenteremin blog spam or who are these spammers? Just people
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:57.840]   that want to, I mean, it's all different kinds of sites. We ban dozens of URLs per
[00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:03.320]   day, dozens of accounts. And these just happen to be a couple really good
[00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.800]   submitters. I had added to my friends list here probably several weeks ago
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.360]   and I was digging their stories because there were submitting stories from wire.
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.960]   There were submitting stories from just a variety of different really good
[00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:17.480]   high quality sites. I was digging their stories and listed as number 19 on that
[00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:25.440]   day. And then they spam you. Right. Well, after they kind of create, so it's
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:28.880]   really strange. Some spammers will try and attack right away. Others will wait and
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:35.840]   kind of sit on these accounts for even months to kind of create some type of
[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:40.080]   get a following on the site because they're a good... Is this a structural flaw with
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:44.520]   the way dig works or can you fix it? Well, it's one of those things that we're
[00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:48.760]   just now, it's funny that this should happen when it did because we've known
[00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:54.560]   about this problem for a while and that people are creating like bots and bots
[00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:58.360]   don't necessarily all have to dig at the same time. Sometimes they will dig with
[00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:02.520]   different accounts that are out of order. Sometimes they will dig 45 minutes
[00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:06.400]   apart. Sometimes they'll rapid dig. So we've known for quite some time that we
[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:09.040]   had to start looking into this information and we had to start tracking
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:14.000]   different users and groups that are digging together. These hordes that are
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.400]   getting together and digging different stories to look for potential fraud and
[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:21.440]   potential spam. It's just the nature of the beast. Any time you have a
[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:26.360]   website that has that much traffic and people, these spammers know that if
[00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:31.240]   they can get their story, they will try so many different ways to get it on the
[00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:37.520]   homepage. So this guy for Evergeek says he's been banned from Dig is that true?
[00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:41.680]   So what happened here is that this is actually kind of funny because he
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:46.240]   submitted the story. It was reported by a bunch of users and removed from the
[00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:51.280]   site. So how Dig works is that once you submit a story, if people go in and
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:54.760]   bury the story. So just like you can dig a story, you can also go and bury a story
[00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:58.720]   to say this is lame or this is a duplicate or this is spam. And once it
[00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:02.520]   hits a certain threshold of reports, it'll be removed from the site altogether.
[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:05.200]   Right. And that's what happened. You need that because there's a lot of, you
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:09.000]   know, people will put stuff up that's either stolen or crappy or duplicate or
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.160]   old. To be honest, that's about 90% of our spam detection right there is done by
[00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:16.800]   the users themselves. They actually will find the stories, they'll flag them and
[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:20.600]   when enough people flag them, the system automatically performs actions on those
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:24.520]   stories, whether it be removing them, whether it be, we have all kinds of
[00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:28.160]   crazy things that kind of go behind the scenes. Well, that's the spirit of
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:31.880]   something like Dig or Wikipedia or anything else is that it's community
[00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:35.400]   driven. So the community police is it. Right. Exactly. So the majority of the
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:39.160]   community is doing the policing there. And what happens is if enough users
[00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:44.360]   report a single URL, it will get removed or placed on hold so that it can't be
[00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:49.080]   submitted over and over again. So what happened is this user was getting
[00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:54.000]   reported, their stories were yanked from the site and then they did a no now. They
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.840]   went and they created multiple accounts under the same IP address and tried to
[00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:02.160]   promote their own stories. They spam you. So this forever geek started spamming
[00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:05.640]   the same story saying, Hey, this is censorship. How can you do this? Right.
[00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:09.880]   Created multiple accounts actually exchanged emails with our admins or
[00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:14.800]   moderators saying why was this, you know, blocked? Why was this put on hold? And
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:18.360]   our moderators were very upfront with them and said, Hey, listen, you can submit
[00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:22.360]   as many stories as you want to dig about how dig is, you know, somehow
[00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:25.640]   censoring your document, but you can't create multiple accounts to try and
[00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:29.800]   spam the site. You can't do that. It's against our terms of service. You know,
[00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:33.000]   if you agree that you're not going to continue to do this, we'll unbany your
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.080]   URL. And so they sent an email back saying, Okay, we agree and we unblock
[00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:40.520]   the URL. So they're unblocked right now. Right. So how many moderators? How
[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:44.720]   many how many paid moderators do you have? Well, there's three right now.
[00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:48.040]   And there's people that are watching at 24 seven. So it's always, it's always
[00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:52.040]   under watch. And but the confusion really comes in actually how stories are
[00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:55.920]   promoted to the homepage, because one of the things, well, one of the problems
[00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:58.680]   here and something that we're going to change in the near future is that there
[00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:02.800]   really is partial transparency into actually what is happening on the site.
[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:07.200]   So you can't see when a story is starting to lose momentum or being that
[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:10.920]   is being buried unless you go into dig spy. So what we're going to be doing is
[00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:14.520]   in the near future, we're actually going to be adding the ability so that users
[00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:18.800]   can see when stories have been removed from the system by the users, why they
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:22.840]   were removed by the users. And then you also have the ability to vote to have
[00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:26.720]   something reinstated if it's been falsely removed, much like the way that
[00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:30.760]   Wikipedia does articles when they've been when they're up for deletion.
[00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:35.280]   Same principle, we're going to apply that to dig. But as far as the promotion
[00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:40.160]   is is concerned, you know, for when we first launched, actually, when when I
[00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:43.680]   first came up with digging, we launched the concept, it was based on a hard
[00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:47.040]   number of digs. So something, you know, at that time, we had no traffic at all.
[00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:50.520]   So something had 15 digs. The story would make it on the home page.
[00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:54.920]   Now it's based on so many different factors because there's actually a
[00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:58.520]   promotion algorithm that goes into place that actually looks and picks out
[00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:00.720]   these stories and promotes them to the home page.
[00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:04.400]   So I've always wondered that because it's not you would think, Oh, if you go to
[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:07.800]   dig.com, you'll get the top stories. That's a separate page. That's the top
[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:10.960]   stories page. Right. So what you're seeing right there is like the most
[00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:15.480]   recently promoted story by the algorithm. So can you can you roughly
[00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:18.760]   describe the algorithm or is it really too common? Yeah, I can I can give you a
[00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:23.000]   good idea of basically how it works. Promotion works on several different
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.920]   things. One, we know the difference between real accounts and fake accounts.
[00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:30.520]   So if you create 50 different accounts right now and you all dug the same story,
[00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:34.920]   nothing's going to happen to that story. So and how this spammer got around
[00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:37.280]   that, though, is they were creating accounts that were actually doing real
[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:42.240]   quality activity, we're gaining quality karma. And then when they all dug that
[00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:46.080]   they actually had a legitimate account that could act towards promotion of the
[00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:48.680]   story. Fortunately, most people aren't going to spend that much energy.
[00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:51.520]   Right. Exactly. So that's but that's something we have to deal with. But
[00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:56.080]   basically it's based on the time of day was submitted, the category that it was
[00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:59.360]   being submitted to. So some categories received more traffic than others. The
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:04.080]   total number of digs, the karma behind the scenes that is applied to the story.
[00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:07.680]   We also look at things like user reports. So if something has a high number of
[00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:10.880]   reports, it's going to require more digs to get promotion of the homepage. We
[00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:14.960]   look at things like are the diggers behind proxies? Are there like IP addresses?
[00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:17.800]   I mean, there's a whole slew of things. It's kind of like Google's page rank
[00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:21.880]   technology where, you know, there's just dozens and dozens of different factors
[00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:25.600]   that go into the algorithm that actually determine what what and when
[00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:28.800]   something should get promoted. So and you've added this over time. I mean,
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:31.680]   this wasn't the way it was when you first started. Oh, exactly. I mean,
[00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:35.240]   well, we realized very quickly after we first started that, you know, people
[00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:38.840]   will try and spam the system. So this has been one of those things that we
[00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:42.720]   constantly tweak the algorithm is still undergoing changes and will continue to
[00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:47.440]   get tweaked going forward. And it's it's all the research that we have to do and
[00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:52.480]   have to continue to do to kind of safeguard that. So if I see something on
[00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:57.760]   the front page, it's there because it's recently promoted. Right. So what
[00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:00.960]   happens is right around there, there's no editors on the side. So every single
[00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:04.200]   story that you see is actually submitted by an individual that has an account
[00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:09.480]   on dig. We get about 1300 news stories submitted per day. They all live in this
[00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:14.080]   like bin, the separated by categories for 24 hours. So they have 24 hours to get
[00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:17.880]   enough votes before they're actually promoted to the homepage or enough digs.
[00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:21.680]   Okay. And so if they don't make it 24 hours, they can still get promoted, but
[00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:24.880]   they just fall out of that bin out of that queue so that people won't be able
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:27.040]   to find them any longer. They can still find them through searching and through
[00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:30.960]   other people's profiles. They don't go away, but they're not as visible. Right.
[00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:35.880]   Exactly. So, you know, it's important that, you know, people just have to realize
[00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:40.400]   that dig really wasn't designed. It's it's not like we didn't design it to where
[00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:44.520]   it's like a one-to-one vote and it's not designed to, you know, elect a president
[00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:47.080]   or something. It was really designed just to kind of keep the mass give the
[00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:52.280]   masses away to find and share quality stories and news. That's the main the
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:55.480]   main thing behind dig is every time you dig something, it's syndicated to your
[00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:59.640]   profile, it's written to RSS, it's shared with your friends, and that's how you
[00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:04.360]   find stories. In fact, the way that I found those those stories that I dug, I
[00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:07.360]   mean, I dug dozens of stories from these spammers. You can go through my account
[00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:11.280]   in all different positions, not just... She's not 17 every time. Mystery number 17.
[00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:16.480]   It was like, I was number four sometimes, I was number 300 sometimes, but I found
[00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:19.480]   that all through my friends profile because every time a friend digs on the
[00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:24.040]   side, it's presented to you in your own unique RSS feed. I get updates every, you
[00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:28.000]   know, five minutes showing what my friends have been digging that pop up in my RSS
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.200]   reader. So... So it's just a chance that you got 17 and that you were in the middle
[00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:35.960]   of a bunch of automated stuff. Oh, I mean, you can... I welcome anyone to look
[00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:38.800]   through my profile. You can see I've been all over the place on these. They've
[00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:42.400]   submitted a lot of really quality stories, which was interesting, but I guess
[00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:45.800]   whatever it was that they were trying to promote or whatever site just never
[00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:49.440]   got around to it. There was a lot of wired articles, I mean, a list of parts
[00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:53.520]   of great site, and they have just a lot of other really good quality content, but
[00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:56.600]   it's one of those things that people do to kind of build up their accounts
[00:14:56.600 --> 00:15:00.640]   before they actually spam the site. I don't envy you having to fight this. I mean,
[00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:04.960]   it's a pain in the butt. Oh, it's just the nature of the business. Yeah, but it's a
[00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:08.400]   shame because, I mean, well, first of all, I should say you're succeeding. I mean,
[00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:11.920]   the front page of dig consistently comes up with interesting stuff that you don't
[00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:14.800]   see anywhere else, which is really probably the goal, right? You don't want all the
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:18.840]   same stories you see on Slash. You want unique, interesting new stuff. And that
[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:24.000]   works. I don't see a lot of spam, so your anti-spam is working. So I think that's the
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.200]   bottom line. Yeah, it's much like I think of like Gmail or any of these other
[00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:31.240]   services every once in a while, something's going to slip through. But for the most
[00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:34.600]   part, if we can just stay on top of it and crack down the spammers, everything's
[00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:38.640]   going to be okay. So thank you Kevin for a I appreciate that. I'm glad you could
[00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:44.040]   come on in. Yeah, well, one other thing I want to say real quick. So I'm actually
[00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:46.840]   going to we're going to be launching some stuff on the blog here in the near
[00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:50.800]   future of some research that we've been doing about these bots and watching the
[00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:54.640]   dig activity. And we've actually been working with this company, it's visualizing
[00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:58.720]   the digs and can detect patterns. And it's one of the most amazing things to watch
[00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:02.080]   to watch the actual activity in like a visual medium where you can see all the
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:05.320]   digs happening in real time as representing the small little dots on a map.
[00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:08.880]   And so this is actually something that we've been wanting to incorporate in the
[00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:11.960]   site for quite some time, but haven't gotten around to doing it yet. But I'll be
[00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:15.520]   putting up and showing examples of these bots and spammers and you can
[00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:19.120]   actually watch videos of all these real time digs happening. So that'll be
[00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:21.640]   something fun for people to check out in the next few days. When you watch a
[00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:26.520]   visualization like that, is it easier to see? Oh, without a doubt, because it's
[00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:31.480]   very hard to detect when spammers are when you play it back though and watch
[00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:34.920]   the activity of spammers, you'll see these little zips, these little lines occur
[00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:38.720]   because you'll watch these bots and you'll see these mast digs just a little line
[00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:43.560]   will like appear and then disappear across the screen. And that is a spammer
[00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:47.160]   that's actually trying to gain the system. So it's a lot of fun to kind of
[00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:51.800]   create these tools and be able to analyze that stuff. But you'll see what
[00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:54.200]   I'm talking about. It's pretty unique stuff. Do you ever think you'd go from
[00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:59.720]   being the bad boy hacker to the guy who's fighting the bad boy hacker? Well, it's
[00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:04.760]   challenging, but you know, no system's perfect. It's just like Wikipedia or
[00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:07.440]   any of these other sites that are user driven and user powered. It's like we
[00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:10.480]   constantly fighting the fight and this is the way it's going to continue to be.
[00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:14.240]   But I think it's worth it because I mean I really do think you get something when
[00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:17.520]   you get the wisdom of crowds together and really makes a difference. Yeah,
[00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:21.000]   definitely. Yeah, even if the crowds can be on a really at times. All right,
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.960]   story number two, I thought this was really challenging. I'd love to get
[00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:28.200]   everybody to weigh in on this one because I don't know how I feel about it.
[00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:34.040]   It's Yahoo. Once again in the news for the third time being accused by a
[00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:37.840]   Paris based humans rights group, it's called reporters without borders, say
[00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:42.880]   that Yahoo turned over a draft email on its email system to Chinese authorities
[00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:47.040]   who use the information to jail a dissident on subversion charges. The
[00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:50.800]   dissident was creating a document in his he hadn't mailed it. He was creating it
[00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:56.480]   in his Yahoo mail account. It doesn't say whether the Chinese authorities went to
[00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:59.960]   Yahoo and said who is this or whether Yahoo did it on their own. I would hope
[00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:03.280]   they didn't do it on their own. Nevertheless, for the third time they've
[00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:08.960]   been accused now of doing this. In 2003, one dissident was given a four year
[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:13.520]   sentence based on the information provided by Yahoo to the Chinese government.
[00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:19.800]   What do you do with this? Robert, how do you feel about it? It just shows that you
[00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:24.680]   probably shouldn't be using public or web based email. Blame the dissident? No,
[00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:28.160]   no blaming the dissident at all. It's just that you have to be aware because
[00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:31.760]   unless you carefully read the terms and conditions of using Yahoo's mail service
[00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:37.280]   or any free web service like that, you run into those risks where you could
[00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:41.960]   end up having that data either handed over or forcibly turned over to people
[00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:46.320]   who don't have your best interest in mind. Short of just adopting strong
[00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:49.560]   encryption policies on your own end and encrypting everything you put into
[00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:53.360]   that system which is a pain for the most part with any web based service,
[00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:59.400]   you're leaving that info out there to be used against you. I think it's
[00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:03.400]   unfortunate that Yahoo was pressured into a situation like that. I don't know why
[00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:07.000]   they did it maybe because they're worried about doing continued business
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:12.200]   with China, say? Well, but here's the thing. If the same thing happened in the
[00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:17.680]   States, if a terrorist and the Federal Homeland Department of Homeland Security
[00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:23.640]   says terrorists do this, they use mail accounts as drop boxes. So instead of
[00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:27.720]   sending the mail, which would of course expose them to discovery, they save a
[00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:31.040]   draft and then they give somebody the password to log into the account. That's
[00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:40.200]   pretty crafty. So and if the DOJ came to a, you know, subpoenaed Yahoo and said,
[00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:43.080]   "Hey, we've got a terrorist in there." Yahoo turned it over. Sure they would.
[00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:46.080]   Here's an example of something Yahoo wouldn't turn over. Maybe the story
[00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:50.040]   changed. I remember way back during 9/11 when 9/11 happened, there was some
[00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:54.920]   family member whose daughter died in one of the buildings and he wanted to have
[00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:59.520]   access to her email account just because he wanted to see maybe just lost
[00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:02.600]   communications from his daughter, some of the stuff that was going on with her.
[00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:08.160]   And Yahoo wouldn't surrender that info. Oh yeah, you remember that although they
[00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:13.440]   did eventually settle in court, but that person had died. It's interesting.
[00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:16.840]   That was probably in the privacy policy and they didn't have anything about
[00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:22.040]   dead people. It was a matter of individuals to the government.
[00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:26.680]   And government gets anything it wants. She was in China.
[00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:32.440]   Right. So that I guess is the point is if you're in China and Waz made this
[00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:36.880]   point on the infamous yellow lasers episode and got a lot of heat for it, but
[00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:42.080]   I think it's he maybe didn't state it exactly properly or but if you're in
[00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:46.520]   doing business in a government, you have to obey that government's laws. The real
[00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:51.160]   question is should Yahoo be doing business in a totalitarian state? Right?
[00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:54.440]   Because as soon as you do business in China, well if Chinese government comes
[00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:57.960]   to you, you got to do what they'd say. Well Google's doing censored Google
[00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:02.040]   searches in China because China's a massive freaking economy. Hard to say.
[00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:06.000]   It's not just Google. It's everyone. Google was just one of the last ones to
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.280]   step in the line, the story I've been told. Oh yeah. Everybody who's involved in
[00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:12.680]   search. There's always there's always this conversation about whether it
[00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:18.720]   should be whether you should embrace a China or or ostracize them. And I
[00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:23.200]   think a lot of the argument is is that it by having some impact there, I think
[00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:27.120]   this is how they I think they it's rationalization. The rationalization is
[00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:30.560]   is that it begins to open that up and and eventually people work around the
[00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:35.280]   system anyway. Yeah, but what they really are saying is one billion Chinese times
[00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:39.240]   ten dollars a year. Right. And the thing is we can talk about China but I
[00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:42.800]   mean the United States wants that they're now looking to pass laws that say
[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:48.800]   that I all ISPs have to keep their data up to a year. You know all of our all of
[00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:51.680]   everything that we're transferring back and forth and you see that I mean now
[00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:56.040]   they're subpoenaing people's Google mail accounts. They're there. Well I guess
[00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:59.200]   that we did mail. That was Robert and David's point which is just forget any
[00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:04.200]   privacy on these accounts. The only issue is well you know here in this here in
[00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:10.120]   the US we hope the government will only do it for reasons we care about in China
[00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:14.160]   they're subversive. You know what's a subversive is it a terrorist? Well the
[00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:18.120]   Chinese government says subversive are terrorists. They're planning you know
[00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:22.520]   death and destruction. They're planning to oust us out of our high and
[00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:26.400]   lordly position. Well they're planning to bring information to the people we
[00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:29.560]   don't want them to bring information. No they say this is now this sound this
[00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:32.400]   quote if you if you change it just slightly could be the same thing that the
[00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:35.760]   US government would say. They arrested these activists for making
[00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:39.200]   preparations for organizing a party and to use violence to overthrow the
[00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:43.760]   Communist Party. So you could say to China it's a national security issue.
[00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:47.080]   Exactly. And the United States says that they have a national security issue. You
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:49.920]   better believe they do everything to try and get it. I mean if the US
[00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:53.400]   government says this is a group that's forming to overthrow the US government
[00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:58.080]   by violence that's the same thing. Do you guys hear that worrying noise? Can you
[00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:02.400]   hear it? The worrying? What's that? It's the sound of George Orwell spinning in his
[00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:06.840]   grave. Hey another voice has joined us. We said goodbye to Kevin Rose Patrick
[00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:11.680]   Norton is now on the line from Las Vegas. Hey Patrick. How's it going? So I'm
[00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:16.480]   glad we got you. You got your Diet Coke. I'm excited. I got a 12 pack of Diet Coke.
[00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:22.880]   Oh geez. Stand back. So I mean I think this is a really interesting story. I
[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:28.080]   think Yahoo really is doing what any company would do in another country. They
[00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:32.080]   have to obey the laws of that country. Well I think the biggest I think the
[00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:35.320]   biggest thing for people to realize I think a lot of us as we get used to email
[00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:39.280]   will we get very lax about it. We're willing to say just about anything on
[00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:42.800]   email. We people can get very disconnected and people just have to
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:46.520]   remember beyond all what the rights issues are here between the Yanehana
[00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:50.080]   state of China is that if you're sending an email it is like sending a legal
[00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:53.760]   letter to somebody. He never said it. He never said it. It was a draft. If you're
[00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:56.800]   doing anything online. You're just you're leaving you're leaving a record
[00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:59.880]   there. That's why you just need to be really clear. Yeah that's why you speak
[00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:05.280]   GP. Yeah. But he's interesting because we're now blaming the victim. Well it's
[00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:09.680]   just the people need to be aware of what their risks are. We're not whether
[00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:13.480]   it's right or wrong. We can't. Our chances of changing what the government's
[00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:18.040]   going to do is less likely than our ability to be be conscious of what we're
[00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:22.440]   doing when we do it. You know as we as we go down that process. I think the
[00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:26.200]   victim is aware too of that he's living in a place where that information could
[00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:30.520]   be used against him. And you think if anybody would be on top of knowing how
[00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:33.320]   to protect their own personal information it would be a Chinese citizen
[00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:36.920]   with a government that you know could possibly use anything and everything
[00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:42.040]   that's written down against them. Hey I use PGP in the US. Yep. And that's a
[00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:48.280]   smart smart for everyone. And you're not even a revolutionary are you? What?
[00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:54.880]   They say you PGP are you a revolutionary. So let's talk about the next story. Air Force
[00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:58.240]   One did you see this? This video is awesome. I don't know if it was worth the
[00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:01.760]   money and time. Can you imagine how awesome. Why don't you tell us what happened David?
[00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:07.280]   You know what I saw the video because it was on the on the twist list on
[00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:12.920]   delicious. But I guess some people rented a Boeing 747 somewhere. You're
[00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:16.880]   telling them that you're giving away the secret. So here's what happened a
[00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:19.400]   video was distributing like an impression. Well yeah because you're
[00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:24.800]   telling the punchline. I'm giving the payoff. You tell you how. Yeah first you
[00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:29.120]   say this video circulated of these guys and they're in their wearing hoods.
[00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:33.880]   They're sneaking through the Air Force base. You see the guards. They sneak by.
[00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:41.280]   They spray paint Air Force One with graffiti saying still free right. And
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:46.960]   now the Air Force saw this. In fact Lieutenant Colonel Bruce Alexander
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:51.440]   a spokesman for the air mobility commands 89th airlift wing which operates Air
[00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:56.680]   Force One said we're looking at it too. They were worried. I said that it looked
[00:25:56.680 --> 00:26:03.960]   very real and they had to actually check the aircraft for. To see if it had been
[00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:07.880]   vandalized and so. Now you can tell your part David. Well my
[00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:11.760]   parts the ball my parts like the hell. It's great they did it. They admitted it.
[00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:16.000]   Yeah so this this organization they rented I think it was in San Bernardino
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:20.480]   they rented a 747 which they did admit cost quite a good amount of money. They
[00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:25.200]   painted a good portion of it like one side of it the majority of it to the
[00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:30.040]   exact or almost the exact color scheme and logo scheme. It has the seal of the
[00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:33.680]   president on it. I mean everything there. And then they I don't know how if they
[00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:36.400]   what kind of people they used for guards and to make it look like it was at a
[00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:40.320]   location but it really looked like it was in some Air Force base over a big
[00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:44.120]   you know some chain link fences and stuff and they made it look like they
[00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:48.080]   were running with with they had a couple guys with a video cameras and some of
[00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:51.240]   them were the ones that ran up there and one of them wasn't and they jumped
[00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:55.320]   the fence ran over there with their graffiti painted this stuff and took off.
[00:26:55.320 --> 00:27:00.240]   Isn't it great. But the fact that it was 100% you know as far as I know it was
[00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:05.320]   100% no special effects no nothing so it was 100% legitimate video it just
[00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:08.360]   wasn't legitimate video of Air Force one. This is the way this is the way
[00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:12.760]   special effects used to be done Prager. I didn't know for real. Well I think how
[00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:16.080]   much less money could have. Yeah I've got special things to use now because you
[00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:19.480]   don't have to actually buy get a jet and paint it. Right but it's Mark Eko's
[00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:23.400]   crew that did it. Well see that's the second that's the second bottom line so
[00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:27.880]   you still free what is still free you go to still free.com and now you know what
[00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:32.240]   the story is Mark Eko who's Mark Eko Patrick. Mark Eko is mostly known for
[00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:37.960]   designing clothing and recently got involved in video game designs and he's
[00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:43.000]   also he's got a strong tie to the graffiti community. I think you had
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:46.600]   worn echo clothes on the screen. I have worn echo clothes. Front of mine almost
[00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:50.200]   actually did some designs for them. It's kind of funny it's like if you look at
[00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:54.280]   the bottom of still free.com the web page Mark Eko Enterprises does not condone
[00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:56.920]   illegal activity acts of vandalism or the destruction of other people's
[00:27:56.920 --> 00:28:00.860]   property. We do however advocate freedom of expression graffiti as a recognized
[00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:03.720]   art form in the protection of consumer rights regardless of age, race, religion
[00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:08.200]   or political you know. That's walking affiliation. Don't do it in China. Well
[00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:12.360]   there's I'm trying to get the name versus unbelievably talented guy down in San
[00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:19.320]   Jose and he went to Japan I guess the second or third time maybe he went to
[00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:25.400]   Japan he would just go on these absolute berserk bonzai runs with his spray
[00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:30.360]   cans and leaving tags everywhere and I guess this you know the last time he
[00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:35.240]   did there he got you know nabbed like within 24 hours like off the plane of
[00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:40.280]   then 24 hours was arrested and in jail because he was caught. I think this is
[00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:44.680]   cool. So Eko has a lot of money though. I mean that's... Eko's yeah. If you've ever seen
[00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:48.440]   sort of a you know big old hip-hop-y kind of skate clothes with a
[00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:51.560]   rhinoceros on it that's Mark Eko. Yeah. Well the thing is is that it's not
[00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:55.160]   just something that was fun to do it's an excellent marketing campaign. It's
[00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:58.520]   brilliant. Did they get enough attention? The only reason I asked is because I
[00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:03.000]   didn't see it until just recently. Well it went out Tuesday you know it
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:07.480]   did not get it's not it's no lazy Sunday right which is now the benchmark for
[00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:13.400]   viral video. I think Mark made a mistake by tipping his hand too soon. I don't
[00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:18.440]   think he should have waited a few weeks before he said how he did it. Yeah maybe
[00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:22.520]   so. But it's a great idea. I think you're gonna see a lot more of this. I think
[00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:25.560]   it's you're right. I think it's marketing Alex. It's not it's not
[00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:32.040]   altruistic he isn't as fun. It's a very clever way to advertise Eko clothing.
[00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:35.480]   Or Eko's video games or you know the graffiti
[00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:38.440]   positions. I mean positions the brand where exactly where they want to
[00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:43.000]   Eko lifestyle right. Yeah. But you know maybe he's maybe he's
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:46.600]   chicken now. Maybe he was afraid that it was too realistic. I don't know.
[00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:50.280]   But he didn't violate any laws at all by doing it. No. None. None. None.
[00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:53.480]   Yeah. None. But you know who knows. It's still quite legal. It could be
[00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:56.840]   illegal to pretend yourself. You know it's it's it's it's pushing people
[00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:59.640]   towards the over violent overthrow of the United States government. That's
[00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:03.960]   right. Well according to the next version of the DMCA he might have
[00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:08.520]   violated the copyright of the design of the P. logo. Hey let's talk about that.
[00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:13.160]   Because this is CNET broke this story this week
[00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:18.040]   and it is just pissing me off. It's according to CNET they've seen the law
[00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:21.800]   nobody has yet because it's not been introduced. It is backed by Alberto
[00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:26.520]   Gonzalez Bush's attorney general and representative Lamar Smith. It is
[00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:31.480]   called the Intellectual Property Protection Act of 2006.
[00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:35.560]   And I bet you if you looked at who designed you know if you looked in
[00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:39.640]   in the Microsoft Word document you would find the Recording Industry
[00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:44.520]   Association of America all over this sucker. Up hauling and I hope it doesn't
[00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:48.440]   go very far. Although Gonzalez I mean the way the
[00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:51.640]   administration is being thrown behind it. Let me give you the quote from
[00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:55.880]   Alberto Gonzalez. He says let's see if I can find it here.
[00:30:57.880 --> 00:31:01.800]   Such changes are necessary. This is basically criminalizing
[00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:06.120]   not only creating copy you know circumventing copy protection but even
[00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:09.880]   owning a device or a program that could circumvent copy protection would be
[00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:13.880]   a federal offense punishable by 10 years in prison.
[00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:16.760]   Such changes are necessary, Susan Gonzalez, because
[00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:19.720]   quote the new technology is encouraging large-scale criminal
[00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:23.240]   enterprises to get involved in intellectual property theft and
[00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:28.680]   quite frankly to fund terrorism activities. Of course it's to fight terrorism.
[00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:32.440]   I'm not sure how they tie terrorism into that. It's just
[00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:36.120]   you know it's all those 17 year old kids. You know that handbrake. Oh some have been
[00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:41.320]   laden has alcohol in 20 percent and he's not afraid of it.
[00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:47.800]   Yeah it's true I think that it's just truly an amazing thing to watch.
[00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:51.400]   You know what makes me mad is that it's not just the Recording Industry
[00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:55.560]   and the Motion Picture Association. Symantec, Sun Microsystems, Oracle, and
[00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:59.480]   Tuitt Red Hat. Other companies in the software industry are throwing their
[00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:04.600]   weight behind this too. Yeah I want to say something I'm just
[00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:08.600]   speechless. It's like you can't it's so far reaching and
[00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:14.920]   the DMCA First Act was outrageous and this just takes it a whole
[00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:18.360]   you know whole step further and it's uh I think that the other thing though is I
[00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:22.600]   think it really is going to open up a conversation that Lawrence Lessick's
[00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:26.200]   having which is you know do we with the whole Creative Commons which of
[00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:31.000]   course I'm a big fan of and it opens it actually opens a market for the
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.800]   for people who are willing to produce inside of that. You know we're committed
[00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:37.000]   the pixel core is very committed to producing all of our stuff inside of
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.960]   Creative Commons specifically because I think that there's an opportunity to
[00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:43.000]   say they're going to lock down that copyright they're going to push all that
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:47.560]   stuff into a whole and we're going to we're going to exploit the rest of the
[00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:50.360]   market. That's interesting. You think we're going to be upset? We're going to have
[00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:53.000]   two tiers of content we're going to have copyrighted content and Creative
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:56.200]   Commons content. I think it's I think that there's a possibility of that and
[00:32:56.200 --> 00:33:00.520]   and the thing is is that the RIA and the MPAA and whoever else is playing this
[00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:03.800]   should be careful because one of the things that I saw you know in high-end
[00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:06.680]   computer graphics you know everyone's trying to protect their content because
[00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:10.600]   it's $60,000 for a piece for some code you know that they're charging per
[00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:14.040]   seat you know alias studio or whatever it was $60,000 when I was working on it
[00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:17.080]   so everyone wants to to keep track of all of that and what was interesting
[00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:21.720]   was is the ones that were the most pirated were often the ones that were
[00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:24.760]   also the most financially successful because everyone got to play with it
[00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:28.440]   everyone got to use it and the one and the companies that were the most
[00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:32.600]   successful at protecting their software are no longer in business. Here's one of
[00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:36.360]   the one of the features of this new law which again has not been yet put in
[00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:41.240]   into committee or anything it's it's not been proposed yet. They're going to
[00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:46.280]   follow the criminal forfeiture techniques pioneered by federal drug laws the
[00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:50.200]   Rico Act which means that they could there'll be civil asset forfeiture
[00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:53.800]   penalties for anything used in copyright piracy so
[00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:58.760]   if you have a copy of CDX copies DVDX copy they could they could take your
[00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:01.560]   computer computers or other equipment sees must be destroyed or
[00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:05.720]   otherwise disposed of at government auction. Furthermore
[00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:08.520]   that gives them the right to impound server records
[00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:11.960]   which is exactly what the RIA has wanted for a long time one of the things that's
[00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:15.080]   been in their way in these lawsuits is they they can't they have to file John
[00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:19.320]   into lawsuits they can't go without court order they can't get the
[00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:23.320]   the name that goes with the IP address which of course ties you back to the
[00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:26.760]   whole homeland security when we want the IS the ISPs to hang on to their
[00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:29.880]   server data for a year and maybe it's not as much for
[00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:35.080]   terrorism as it is for the RIA. I think they make these laws too broad I
[00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:37.960]   mean there's a lot of companies that everyone's
[00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:40.280]   surprised they're backing this and that's because
[00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:44.120]   you know companies like Microsoft and Sun make certain pieces of software that
[00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:48.120]   they don't want to be pirated because it hits up a little bit on
[00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:51.160]   on their potential revenue and selling things and include it up to it
[00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:53.640]   including as well what the recording industry wants to be able to sell
[00:34:53.640 --> 00:34:56.280]   records from and they want to be you could even say that the
[00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:59.800]   indie artists theoretically could want to make sure that they
[00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:03.080]   sell their stuff rather than rather than having it copy written but when they
[00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:07.240]   write the law so damn broad there was one person in this
[00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:10.280]   scene at news article from Wayne State University who said
[00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:13.880]   under this new law if Sony decided to stand on its rights
[00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:18.440]   with that rootkit thing if McAfee or nor antivirus had tried to remove the
[00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:21.560]   rootkit it would be violating this new DMCA and that's
[00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:25.960]   why there's a problem with it being too broad and it's just easier I think
[00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:29.000]   for these people to support it because it makes it easier to just
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:33.080]   you know prosecute the crap out of anything. There's of course the broad
[00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:36.040]   from a lawyer's point of view the broadness is actually its weak point
[00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:39.080]   so what we can see this very very wide law be written
[00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:43.080]   it can go into and under exactly that issue under the Sony
[00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:45.720]   the Sony issue the whole law can be struck down so there's also
[00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:48.520]   a right-wing poor law. There's a chilling effect Ed Felton
[00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:52.040]   who was really a great security researcher at Princeton said
[00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:55.720]   he knew about the rootkit the Sony rootkit but didn't publish because he was
[00:35:55.720 --> 00:36:00.200]   afraid of being prosecuted under the DMCA this would make it you know he'd be
[00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:03.560]   facing 10 years in a federal penitentiary.
[00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:08.120]   It's a very scary law. I particularly like the one that's like
[00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:11.720]   it would be a federal crime just trying to commit copyright infringement
[00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:14.920]   willful attempts at piracy even if they fail could be punished by 10 years in
[00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:17.720]   prison so I have this like magic vision of
[00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:21.720]   Google search for something to back up and then since I love exploiting the
[00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:24.680]   children I'll say you know to create a archival copy of a
[00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:30.040]   Disney DVD so that that little Patrick Jr. who doesn't exist yet
[00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:33.320]   you know that's exactly right and then scrub the thing into
[00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:37.800]   oblivion and and you can be arrested for that it's very it's it's I mean it's
[00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:41.000]   it's a strong sign that the companies it's a lot of companies with a lot of
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:44.040]   power. The pendulum has really started. I think it just gets you know
[00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:47.720]   continually more absurd. I think that it's either people are either going to
[00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:50.840]   completely ignore it it'll be completely unenforceable or
[00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:53.640]   there's going to have to be a major revision how we look at copyright law
[00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:57.160]   because right now it's it's mostly based on I mean most of our copyright
[00:36:57.160 --> 00:37:00.520]   laws based on Mickey Mouse as it is right you talk about Mickey Mouse laws
[00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:03.880]   that copyright is a Mickey Mouse law literally it's just you know
[00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:06.920]   everything every all there's all this great open source
[00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:11.080]   content that's available up until right before Mickey Mouse was created
[00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:14.120]   and then everything you know everything we can't touch anything after that
[00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:16.840]   and when you look at how that affects us I mean because it's hard to
[00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:20.120]   think about that for instance it's a wonderful life we would never know
[00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:24.360]   about it's a wonderful life the movie if it hadn't expired right you know if it
[00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:27.000]   hadn't been put out into a more open source you know if it hadn't opened up
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:30.040]   because soon it opened up yeah and in the public domain that that's what
[00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:34.040]   made that's why we suddenly started seeing it all the time
[00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:36.680]   you know and so it does affect us it does affect how we
[00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:40.680]   the you know our experience of a lot of things is this all of this stuff is
[00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:43.720]   being closed down there's this whole thing about Google putting up a
[00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:46.600]   uh an impressionistic did you see this this uh
[00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:50.360]   oh the the John Miro family getting pissed off because Google was
[00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:54.120]   honoring Miro I mean give me a break I mean but this is this is where it's
[00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:57.960]   going on honoring Miro Leo they were exploiting his works for their own
[00:37:57.960 --> 00:38:00.920]   profit they were violating the copyright they were
[00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:04.200]   I mean there's no doubt about it and and Google pulled it down
[00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:07.480]   right so they but Google of course claimed that it wasn't violating the
[00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:11.320]   copyright and I'm not I don't know I mean it's just this is the absurdity
[00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:13.960]   that it's getting to though and I think that what's what's going to happen is
[00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:17.080]   is that once again what what a lot of these copyright holders have to watch
[00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:20.680]   out for is that this creates an environment where it
[00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:24.360]   actually opens a new market and this is exactly where creative commons starts
[00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:28.280]   to open up where if they make it so hard for us to get any of this content
[00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:32.680]   they may find that people start artists and other people and content creators
[00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:36.040]   start choosing another path because they they realize how absurd it is
[00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:40.680]   it's just sad because here here's Google trying to honor and point out
[00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:44.840]   you know Miro's birthday and tell people about this artist
[00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:48.760]   uh and and instead they've got to shut it down and now of course
[00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:52.120]   there's that chilling effect again
[00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:58.280]   hmm really not you sense of you sense of chill
[00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:02.920]   think about the all the history that's available and the the archived
[00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:07.560]   content that's out there and the fact that you know it can
[00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:12.600]   almost in forever now remain under you know copyrighted be considered
[00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:16.920]   copyrighted material it just seems like that that in and of itself it just
[00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:20.440]   limits what people will be able to find or access easily
[00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:23.800]   I mean you think about all the stuff that libraries haven't are able to
[00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:28.040]   give out on a free or limited basis and it
[00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:31.160]   I was you would think that the internet would be at least as easy to use and it's
[00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:35.080]   just turning into this this stifled environment or
[00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:39.640]   everything is owned forever and that nothing will ever be
[00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:43.400]   you know as easy as just making a trip down to my local librarian
[00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:46.440]   hopefully if it's there and being able to check it out for a little or no
[00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:49.560]   cost well there's I mean there's always been there's there's always
[00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:52.600]   some crank that doesn't want the library to be able to
[00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:56.600]   you know lend out books right or you know if if you got right down to it if the
[00:39:56.600 --> 00:40:00.120]   RIAA could outlaw you know I think it what is it right of
[00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:03.720]   first sale which basically I purchased a CD and I have the rights to it therefore
[00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:06.520]   I can sell the CD to somebody they don't like that either they don't like
[00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:09.880]   that you know I mean if if it was a perfect world everything would be set
[00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:13.160]   up like one of those classic world-class ultra-restrictive you know
[00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:16.680]   dongle controlled license to use software licenses
[00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:21.400]   oh well but I mean that's what you know and in one hand it's like you know if
[00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:25.560]   I'm representing company X in my job as the president of company X is to
[00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:29.400]   maximize shareholder value you know I'm not disagreeing about that's the
[00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:32.040]   problem I say it doesn't maximize shareholder value
[00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:34.920]   even and that's the real problem I think it's a fundamental misunderstanding
[00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:40.280]   did the the family of a John Miro do a favor to Miro's estate no
[00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:44.760]   uh do a lot of times is holding on is is greedy
[00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:49.320]   and bad business well it's kind of funny it's like is it's like
[00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:52.840]   you know it's not even it wasn't even republishing a Miro work it was using
[00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:56.920]   Miro's style right I mean they could look at an artist's rights society
[00:40:56.920 --> 00:41:00.360]   which represents the Miro family who's like you know they're underlying
[00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:03.720]   copyrights and and you know you should have talked to us first and it's like
[00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:07.480]   you know you know I seem to remember you know art
[00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:11.400]   feeding upon itself and moving forward in that way right you know and copying
[00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:14.840]   works and mocking it has always been you know part of it you know I mean it's
[00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:19.080]   not like they a piece of a Miro painting and plopped it up there
[00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:22.680]   in fact you want to think that Miro would probably have loved it
[00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:25.720]   well and I think that I think a lot of people forget how many I do
[00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:28.440]   of course because I go to Africa when I get sensitive about how many times a
[00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:32.120]   lot of these artists who are who have been very popular in the not too
[00:41:32.120 --> 00:41:35.160]   distant future made made little trips to Africa and came back and were suddenly
[00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:38.280]   very creative yeah yeah look at all the good ideas
[00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:41.880]   I go hey Walt Disney got Mickey Mouse from a movie that came out a year before
[00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:46.120]   in 1923 I mean we all artists build on the shoulders of other artists and
[00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:49.960]   that's where that's what the society loses hello is your report is your
[00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:55.240]   pizza here's the legal sharks sharks legal sharks could you substantiate
[00:41:55.240 --> 00:42:00.200]   that statement that I read it in Wikipedia for us
[00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:06.200]   I just made that up no I had heard that I probably can't substantiate it I'll
[00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:09.960]   see if I can find the reference but there was a very similar character
[00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:13.640]   apparently to Steamboat Willie which is the first Mickey Mouse movie
[00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:19.320]   that was quite popular the year before stolen is such a harsh word in fact I
[00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:21.720]   don't think there's anything wrong with it okay let's do it this way
[00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:25.480]   I think it was Steamboat Willie came out and then evolved into Mickey Mouse
[00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:28.200]   well but Mickey Mouse is clearly in Steamboat Willie and that was a Disney
[00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:31.880]   production I mean you know the Cinderella sleeping beauty
[00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:36.120]   snow white where do those ideas come from the public domain I mean
[00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:38.920]   you don't have to use Mickey Mouse I can think of a lot of places
[00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:42.760]   but we like to thank the public domain for allowing us to build up the industry
[00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:45.640]   and now that we've built the industry up let's control most of the mass
[00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:49.320]   locations let's just lock down this picture nobody doesn't profit from
[00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:51.960]   anything ever again but I think that I think that what
[00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:54.600]   what we look at is they're doing it to us and they're actually doing something
[00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:58.120]   to themselves by they are going to continually sequester themselves outside
[00:42:58.120 --> 00:43:00.920]   of the market I agree you know and so in the short term this might make
[00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:05.000]   sense to them in the long term I mean I I and personally intend to take
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:07.960]   advantage of what they're doing right I mean I'm not saying this in kind of a
[00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:11.720]   theoretical I think they're going to open up a window and and you know I
[00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:15.160]   personally plan to exploit it well look there's a ton of creative common
[00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:17.480]   stuff I mean I think that there are a lot of people doing this I think you're
[00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:19.960]   right yeah I think it's actually interesting I hadn't really thought of it
[00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:23.000]   but I think there might be this kind of two-tier content system that we're
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:26.120]   creating here and the tear that they're in is going to be a tear that no one's
[00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:29.080]   using because it's too much of a pain in the neck to do yeah who you know I don't
[00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:32.440]   want the feds to come get me because I'm right because I'm somehow breaking a
[00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:37.080]   law that I don't understand right right so adds on for it's unfortunate that it's
[00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:41.000]   all moving in that direction I mean it is stifling access to the the
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:45.400]   library and the the creative works of humanity in a sense I'm not saying it
[00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:50.040]   should all be out there for free is you know but at some point that
[00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:54.920]   information if it's been recorded and it's been indexed and cataloged you should
[00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:58.840]   be able to search that easily with no problems at all I mean I just keep
[00:43:58.840 --> 00:44:01.720]   thinking that look at the instance of the way back machine the internet way
[00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:05.800]   back machine that was that was one of the neatest tools I mean they basically
[00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:11.000]   scoured and preserved the entire first decade of internet use you still doing
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:15.480]   it there's a terabits a day there they're archiving but you can no longer search
[00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:20.680]   through it really like you used to you used to type in it was taken down for
[00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:25.080]   the URL and there's a search for it they're the way back I've wondered I've
[00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:29.080]   wondered yeah this is a we we should talk about to uh Brister Kaleb at it
[00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:33.080]   because I've wondered myself how he gets away with this it's archive.org
[00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:37.160]   and it's really cool but you're right I mean there's a lot of copyright
[00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:40.440]   violation going on in there I don't know because for a long time oh that's cool
[00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:43.800]   looks like it might actually be back but for a couple of years at least or at
[00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:47.240]   least a year ago it was it was taken offline with no
[00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:51.240]   sense of if it was gonna just be preserved or torched or I
[00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:53.480]   actually complete we should point it well no
[00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:57.080]   which is one of the yeah and not to take anything away from Brister Kaleb's
[00:44:57.080 --> 00:44:59.560]   efforts but it's kind of like I'm looking at this and it's like okay so
[00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:02.920]   www.zdtv.com we've got three pages for 90
[00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:06.680]   no no pages for 99 but they may have more uh
[00:45:06.680 --> 00:45:11.400]   I asked JD Lassick about this he's with our media.org and part of this
[00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:15.160]   archive and they archive more stuff than they put up
[00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:18.360]   and I think that's what Robert was saying they are archiving
[00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:22.120]   unbelievably huge amounts of data literally terabytes a day
[00:45:22.120 --> 00:45:25.320]   okay things have changed though because at least now it is
[00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:28.760]   accessible again but before I mean literally I think it was last year I was
[00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:31.640]   trying to pull up files for it and they're saying oh we currently have to
[00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:34.920]   take everything offline due to the the current state of
[00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:38.120]   legislation you know you know what's cool is there is there also getting the
[00:45:38.120 --> 00:45:41.000]   help of libraries around the world to do this
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:44.520]   um they're they're essentially trying to build a library of Alexandria and the
[00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:48.120]   Alexandria library is helping them with it which I love
[00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:52.280]   so I think there is hope for this but there are huge copyright issues
[00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:56.120]   involved I don't know exactly how they solve those and I think one of the
[00:45:56.120 --> 00:45:58.520]   things they're doing is just archiving it and hoping that it gets resolved
[00:45:58.520 --> 00:46:02.040]   down the road but you know props to prove to probably
[00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:05.560]   violates the DMCA somehow sure it does
[00:46:05.560 --> 00:46:10.520]   oh all right moving on apple made of course it's a
[00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:14.280]   usual quarterly announcement of earnings and some very good earnings in
[00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:19.080]   their earnings call on April 19th sales up a billion dollars profit up
[00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:22.600]   41 percent 10 billion in revenue but this is the most
[00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:27.240]   interesting statistic uh 50 according to uh cfo
[00:46:27.240 --> 00:46:31.320]   peter Oppenheimer 50 percent of people buying max in the apple stores
[00:46:31.320 --> 00:46:36.360]   half of them are buying their first max apple not coming out on the bright
[00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:40.280]   side here though in this uh in this case against the rumor
[00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:45.080]   sites the hearing on thursday in the sixth district court of appeals on
[00:46:45.080 --> 00:46:49.960]   their lawsuit apples trying to get these
[00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:55.080]   the information about who gave these rumor sites the secrets
[00:46:55.080 --> 00:46:58.600]   but it looks like I have to say I'm reading the the transcript the judge
[00:46:58.600 --> 00:47:02.360]   the judges are not such big fans of what apples up to
[00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:05.480]   and I don't think they should be I think that even if you're an online
[00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:08.760]   journalist you should receive the same protection as the first I agree
[00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:11.800]   provides to real journalists and I think the judges agree
[00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:16.680]   Franklin Elia asks quote all you want here is the name of a snitch
[00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:20.040]   so you're saying you have the right to invade the privacy of the email system
[00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:23.800]   into trump the first amendment just to find out who in your organization is
[00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:26.760]   giving out inappropriate information that's gotta
[00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:30.920]   hurt that's a good judge I think so if apple really wants to
[00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:33.720]   figure this out what they ought to do is just prove that
[00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:37.960]   they're losing money and it's going to fund terrorism
[00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:42.440]   that's true that's a good idea terrorism gets a lot of funding
[00:47:42.440 --> 00:47:46.440]   they've got to see the article a couple weeks ago from apple insider about
[00:47:46.440 --> 00:47:50.280]   apple computer making a little girl cry oh no what happened
[00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:53.800]   they uh... it's up on apple insider dot com
[00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:57.320]   and some nine-year-old is doing their you know learn how to write a business
[00:47:57.320 --> 00:48:00.680]   lever so she wrote to the chief executive of the company that made
[00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:04.840]   her ipad nano and uh three months later
[00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:08.280]   she gets a letter back from kupertino
[00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:12.520]   and isn't from mr jobs it's from the senior council of the law department
[00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:13.800]   oh god
[00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:17.160]   filling the third grader the apple doesn't accept and i quote unsolicited ideas
[00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:20.840]   so she should send them her suggestions and if she wants to know why she could
[00:48:20.840 --> 00:48:23.960]   read their she should not send her suggestions she wants to know why she
[00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:27.320]   could read their legal policy posted on the internet apparently the little
[00:48:27.320 --> 00:48:31.880]   girl like wigs throws a letter up in the air ran into a room slams the door
[00:48:31.880 --> 00:48:35.080]   and it's like i'm saying a legal reasoning behind that but they killed
[00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:39.560]   bambi's mother now see that's a that's a modern lesson that kids learning that
[00:48:39.560 --> 00:48:43.720]   that's a general counsel called the girl back to apologize
[00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:47.480]   after cbs five to a story on its slamming of
[00:48:47.480 --> 00:48:50.760]   you know in apple's defense we would do the same thing at tech tv people would
[00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:54.200]   send a story ideas what you don't want is somebody to send us a show idea
[00:48:54.200 --> 00:48:58.440]   we don't read it but then we do a similar show and they sue us it's tough nowadays
[00:48:58.440 --> 00:49:01.080]   you can legally you have to send them an email saying that you're or i mean
[00:49:01.080 --> 00:49:04.440]   a letter that says that we're not gonna we can't read this unless you agree
[00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:09.400]   never to sue us but nine years old the lawyer bought a little bit
[00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:11.880]   so that it makes slightly friendlier yeah friendly
[00:49:11.880 --> 00:49:14.680]   or less but that's the response that you know like that
[00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:17.800]   i think if you get down to the issue here though it's it's whether or not an
[00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:23.320]   employee of at apple was was being was exhibiting criminal activity by
[00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:27.800]   by leaking trade secrets right and then and then it's the it's one this is
[00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:31.480]   with the class between the yeah it's the clash between the criminal activity
[00:49:31.480 --> 00:49:34.120]   and the protection that the first amendment provides i think and the
[00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:37.480]   judge said well couldn't you just do a line detector test
[00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:41.400]   i mean what's the deal here i don't think apple's above that either so
[00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:45.720]   oh no i'm sure they're not you told me apple was just getting lazy it's like oh
[00:49:45.720 --> 00:49:48.760]   we won't do an internal audit to figure out how this information is being
[00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:50.920]   leaked but we'll take it into a court system and
[00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:55.000]   see if we can have the legal you know or think it also has it has a social
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:58.280]   effect within the company as well i mean if if you see that apple is really
[00:49:58.280 --> 00:50:01.480]   serious and really upset about leagues coming out of the company
[00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:05.960]   people at apple are generally fairly paranoid about
[00:50:05.960 --> 00:50:08.920]   saying anything oh man related to anything and this
[00:50:08.920 --> 00:50:13.160]   and this only increases that paranoia so that i think that even if they lose
[00:50:13.160 --> 00:50:15.880]   in a lot of ways they made their message that they're
[00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:18.280]   that they're serious about this stuff and if you're going to start leaking it
[00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:21.960]   you better be ready to you know deal with that somebody once told me that uh
[00:50:21.960 --> 00:50:26.920]   steve told three executives uh some secret about an upcoming product or
[00:50:26.920 --> 00:50:30.920]   code name and told them he said i only only you guys
[00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:35.640]   uh know this uh word if it leaks out you will all be fired it leaked out they
[00:50:35.640 --> 00:50:39.720]   were all fired no way that works too hey there's
[00:50:39.720 --> 00:50:43.960]   an interesting parallel of this story to the dmca one we're uh we were talking
[00:50:43.960 --> 00:50:47.000]   about how we're a little bit surprised about certain high-tech companies that
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:49.960]   came out in support of a new d this new dmca
[00:50:49.960 --> 00:50:54.040]   and with this story there's a couple of a high-tech companies including intel
[00:50:54.040 --> 00:50:57.000]   uh they're coming out and writing uh writing little
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:00.600]   file a little briefs called friend of the court in support of apple because
[00:51:00.600 --> 00:51:03.640]   they're also worried about say some of their trade secrets and they want to
[00:51:03.640 --> 00:51:07.400]   know if they could use any legislation that comes out of this to protect
[00:51:07.400 --> 00:51:10.840]   their own intellectual properties if they have it leaked i just got to get
[00:51:10.840 --> 00:51:13.160]   rid of the courts get rid of all the courts we don't need
[00:51:13.160 --> 00:51:16.440]   other the other big question is is that the there's a distinct there's this
[00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:21.640]   distinction that they want to make between uh you know these blogs and a full
[00:51:21.640 --> 00:51:24.760]   fledged newspaper which admittedly a full fledged newspaper has all kinds of
[00:51:24.760 --> 00:51:28.360]   rules about what you can put up and they are and and the newspaper is well kind
[00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:31.080]   of and whether they actually follow them or not or whether they you know
[00:51:31.080 --> 00:51:34.520]   all of that stuff but do you think a blog is less accountable than a newspaper
[00:51:34.520 --> 00:51:38.760]   if a newspaper shows that it didn't do that didn't do uh do pro you know there's
[00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:42.920]   due process of research and so on so forth it can find itself in a lot of legal
[00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:48.280]   problems whereas if a if a blogger who has none of that over their head and just
[00:51:48.280 --> 00:51:51.400]   simply puts up whatever they you know whatever they want to put up
[00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:54.840]   i think the concern is is that you know and dig is a perfect example of of the
[00:51:54.840 --> 00:51:58.680]   vlogosphere going crazy over data that wouldn't show up and did show up in a
[00:51:58.680 --> 00:52:03.160]   couple places uh that are in major media but you're right no print paper picked
[00:52:03.160 --> 00:52:07.080]   out but if a print paper says it this this is also a sort of metallic
[00:52:07.080 --> 00:52:09.800]   the conversations everybody's having around the time when the drudge report
[00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:13.160]   was first thing you know to write and a lot of times the drudge report would
[00:52:13.160 --> 00:52:16.200]   come out with something um and they would be unfettered
[00:52:16.200 --> 00:52:18.600]   you know you could say like yeah they would say things in newspaper wouldn't
[00:52:18.600 --> 00:52:21.560]   say but a lot of times in newspapers would report them five weeks later on
[00:52:21.560 --> 00:52:25.880]   page 12 monica lwinski i mean that drudge was the first person to just
[00:52:25.880 --> 00:52:30.440]   talk about that and you know i mean i'm not saying there's not a lot of
[00:52:30.440 --> 00:52:33.640]   blogging activity that's incredibly irresponsible but
[00:52:33.640 --> 00:52:36.680]   there's also people can be you know can hold themselves to fairly high
[00:52:36.680 --> 00:52:39.960]   standards they can some do and i think that the question is is whether they
[00:52:39.960 --> 00:52:43.400]   are not i mean for instance dan rather arguably lost his job over
[00:52:43.400 --> 00:52:47.400]   posting information that wasn't totally accurate right and and so that's the
[00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:50.360]   that's because of the vlogosphere that wasn't the vlogosphere i mean but
[00:52:50.360 --> 00:52:52.840]   that's what what's happening is that there's a lot of
[00:52:52.840 --> 00:52:55.080]   that but he wouldn't have been fired without the vlogosphere
[00:52:55.080 --> 00:52:59.160]   call exactly all right right exactly but the i think that that's the
[00:52:59.160 --> 00:53:04.200]   his uh but in the in a press environment
[00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:07.240]   you know you can't if he had been a blogger if dan rather been a blogger
[00:53:07.240 --> 00:53:10.040]   i mean he wouldn't have been as big but nobody trusts up i mean everybody
[00:53:10.040 --> 00:53:14.440]   reads blogs knows his it's all bs right i don't know i've had a bunch of
[00:53:14.440 --> 00:53:18.040]   people like great blogs tell us that everything we write it you know zif
[00:53:18.040 --> 00:53:21.880]   davis or cnet or or ich is all you know
[00:53:21.880 --> 00:53:25.400]   bs that's but readers know different i think readers know different i like you
[00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:28.920]   think so you can say anything in your blog as far as you can say anything you want
[00:53:28.920 --> 00:53:33.800]   as long as it's not slanderer or libel right or uh apple trade secret or apple
[00:53:33.800 --> 00:53:36.760]   trade secrets here's a here's a great stupid law
[00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:42.040]   westchester county has passed a law requiring shopkeepers to have wi-fi
[00:53:42.040 --> 00:53:46.360]   security not on the surface of it not a bad idea but what wi-fi security do they
[00:53:46.360 --> 00:53:51.240]   require a firewall not encryption not anything useful
[00:53:51.240 --> 00:53:53.960]   just a firewall
[00:53:53.960 --> 00:53:57.000]   the long this is indicative of just the
[00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:00.120]   all these politicians who have no idea what they're dealing with
[00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:03.320]   and no idea what they're doing and they don't ask enough people or one person
[00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:05.720]   comes up with this really really good idea because someone hacked their
[00:54:05.720 --> 00:54:09.000]   computer you know that's what it is is some council member probably who
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:11.880]   you know someone hacked their computer they got a virus and their chief
[00:54:11.880 --> 00:54:15.560]   information officer westchester county uh... said
[00:54:15.560 --> 00:54:18.760]   that firewalls easily available firewalls will protect credit card
[00:54:18.760 --> 00:54:21.560]   transactions from being detected by a hacker
[00:54:21.560 --> 00:54:24.680]   being posted outside the dry cleaner that uses a wireless network
[00:54:24.680 --> 00:54:27.480]   so this law is bad in so many ways first of all it
[00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:29.880]   this it shouldn't this should not i don't think there should ever be
[00:54:29.880 --> 00:54:32.920]   regulation forcing people to have secure wi-fi
[00:54:32.920 --> 00:54:35.960]   i mean if it's if you have if you have insecure wi-fi it's your problem
[00:54:35.960 --> 00:54:38.760]   it's but second of all if you're going to have legislation they could be
[00:54:38.760 --> 00:54:43.160]   something halfway intelligent they also have uh... now this may not be
[00:54:43.160 --> 00:54:45.640]   secure a new copyright law yeah there you go
[00:54:45.640 --> 00:54:48.600]   they also do force the uh... the uh... the uh...
[00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:51.400]   public hotspots to post post a message
[00:54:51.400 --> 00:54:56.840]   saying you are accessing a network which has been secured with a firewall
[00:54:56.840 --> 00:55:00.360]   however now and this is good they go on and say since such protection does not
[00:55:00.360 --> 00:55:05.080]   guarantee the security of your personal information use your own discretion
[00:55:05.080 --> 00:55:08.840]   so who knows so why is that why is that what is it is that
[00:55:08.840 --> 00:55:09.640]   the
[00:55:09.640 --> 00:55:12.120]   sorry i'm trying to first is there
[00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:15.400]   is it is it has been a problem in the township with her
[00:55:15.400 --> 00:55:20.840]   unsecured wi-fi so is it is it you know i mean if if we're losing the confidence
[00:55:20.840 --> 00:55:25.080]   of the people to use wi-fi in the streets then you know and i love public
[00:55:25.080 --> 00:55:28.440]   love wi-fi this is even about public wi-fi this is bizarre
[00:55:28.440 --> 00:55:32.120]   is bizarre i think they should meet the state trooper in sacramento who
[00:55:32.120 --> 00:55:34.920]   arrested the guy for using a Pringles can antenna
[00:55:34.920 --> 00:55:38.600]   they they all belong together somehow actually you know i could if it was the
[00:55:38.600 --> 00:55:42.040]   right Pringles can help the can antenna help by the right person in the wrong
[00:55:42.040 --> 00:55:44.040]   place i can see where that might happen maybe
[00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:46.200]   especially if they're a bit of a smart ass
[00:55:46.200 --> 00:55:47.720]   yeah maybe
[00:55:47.720 --> 00:55:50.920]   uh... i just i love these wi-fi laws it's funny there's just something that the
[00:55:50.920 --> 00:55:54.520]   local government is just kind of jumped on wi-fi as being
[00:55:54.520 --> 00:55:58.920]   hey with dmca part two you you're not allowed to take a over the shelf
[00:55:58.920 --> 00:56:03.320]   antenna and modify it oh that's right that would be a violation of copyright
[00:56:03.320 --> 00:56:06.760]   actually it's it's a violation now to to hook up in an
[00:56:06.760 --> 00:56:10.760]   untested unapproved on that's the seaprude antenna
[00:56:10.760 --> 00:56:14.840]   wi-fi combination all right patrix and nab why did you go to nab was it
[00:56:14.840 --> 00:56:18.760]   was it uh the food i know although i do love eating in
[00:56:18.760 --> 00:56:22.120]   las vegas there's nothing like a 299 prime rip to make you really long for
[00:56:22.120 --> 00:56:25.480]   home yeah baby yeah baby
[00:56:25.480 --> 00:56:29.480]   the uh actually i'm out here for a couple things um i'm going to meet up with the
[00:56:29.480 --> 00:56:32.280]   folks at new tech who make the tricaster
[00:56:32.280 --> 00:56:34.920]   and that's it you use that for dltv right
[00:56:34.920 --> 00:56:38.840]   yeah that we used to do all of our switching and basically uh
[00:56:38.840 --> 00:56:41.880]   uh it does it switches between our multiple cameras
[00:56:41.880 --> 00:56:45.080]   and it rolls in our lower thirds and our full screens and our videos
[00:56:45.080 --> 00:56:48.680]   and there's a rumor that they're going to have some exciting updates to that
[00:56:48.680 --> 00:56:52.520]   that you know answer some requests i've been
[00:56:52.520 --> 00:56:57.960]   begging in a subtle manner for um and then there's uh kind of meet up with
[00:56:57.960 --> 00:57:02.280]   adobe and a whole bunch of other people looking for
[00:57:02.280 --> 00:57:09.160]   more better stuff more better little video download ip tv
[00:57:09.160 --> 00:57:13.400]   web television thing do we as any as though does any
[00:57:13.400 --> 00:57:17.480]   be always or how long has nab been offering either technology or or
[00:57:17.480 --> 00:57:20.760]   companies that relate to broadcasting over the internet
[00:57:20.760 --> 00:57:24.680]   well it's kind of it's they've always been around there i mean certainly i
[00:57:24.680 --> 00:57:27.640]   haven't i haven't been there this is my first nab in probably five years and
[00:57:27.640 --> 00:57:30.920]   there are a bunch of people doing online video
[00:57:30.920 --> 00:57:34.760]   back then i mean this is i mean this is i mean this is kind of like
[00:57:34.760 --> 00:57:38.200]   you know ces is not quite you know everything in ces you can kind of
[00:57:38.200 --> 00:57:41.000]   eventually see somebody in your neighborhood buying
[00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:44.120]   you know what i mean you maybe you know the the really rich guy is going to buy
[00:57:44.120 --> 00:57:48.440]   some of it but you know like comdex used to be you'd be like wow
[00:57:48.440 --> 00:57:51.800]   giant hardware you know and you wander by because
[00:57:51.800 --> 00:57:55.000]   once you've seen one giant server box you're pretty much done right
[00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:58.360]   but nab's like that and because you've got you know it's like people are like
[00:57:58.360 --> 00:58:01.800]   well it's grass valley funding or you know release the viper recorder you know
[00:58:01.800 --> 00:58:04.760]   they showed us last year or they're just going to show us the box this year
[00:58:04.760 --> 00:58:07.240]   and maker it's drool is there going to be you know people looking for next
[00:58:07.240 --> 00:58:10.760]   generation prosumer HD cameras and it's
[00:58:10.760 --> 00:58:15.160]   you know so the very tiny bit of consumer stuff but it's all over the map
[00:58:15.160 --> 00:58:18.920]   well and in terms of what's going to be here and you go to the nab is so big
[00:58:18.920 --> 00:58:22.040]   you know it's like any of these las vegas ones that there's i can't remember
[00:58:22.040 --> 00:58:24.680]   whether it's the south hall or the north hall but one of the halls is like
[00:58:24.680 --> 00:58:27.560]   it seems like oh it's almost stuff that i could buy you know it's a lot of little
[00:58:27.560 --> 00:58:30.120]   software there's some big stuff there but that's where apple is and
[00:58:30.120 --> 00:58:33.240]   and a lot of the newer media stuff and that's where new tech will be and
[00:58:33.240 --> 00:58:35.960]   they'll be all of these things and you think that wow this is really big and
[00:58:35.960 --> 00:58:39.240]   these companies are really big and then you walk over to the other hall
[00:58:39.240 --> 00:58:42.360]   and you see where real money is being spent so you go over there
[00:58:42.360 --> 00:58:46.280]   that's what i remember you you walk in and there's the sony behemoth it's like
[00:58:46.280 --> 00:58:51.080]   200 by 200 feet and and there's and they had a long nothing production studio
[00:58:51.080 --> 00:58:54.520]   yeah they had a whole newsroom a couple of years ago so there's nothing in this
[00:58:54.520 --> 00:58:57.400]   in one of the halls that cost less i swear it that cost less than a hundred
[00:58:57.400 --> 00:58:59.560]   thousand dollars i mean it's just this incredible
[00:58:59.560 --> 00:59:02.360]   behemoth but but there is a whole hall that has
[00:59:02.360 --> 00:59:04.840]   stuff in podcasting they have a whole i think they have a whole
[00:59:04.840 --> 00:59:08.120]   conference right now podcast i was we were invited to be down there but
[00:59:08.120 --> 00:59:11.160]   i'm going to a canada so we can do but you're going to be doing this week in
[00:59:11.160 --> 00:59:13.960]   media there by the way our new uh newest show
[00:59:13.960 --> 00:59:17.640]   on the twig tv network this twin
[00:59:17.640 --> 00:59:20.760]   Alex host that and it's all about media
[00:59:20.760 --> 00:59:24.040]   yeah and and we're really i mean obviously nab is a big deal for us and so
[00:59:24.040 --> 00:59:27.400]   we've got some guys coming in from uh you know a bunch of the a bunch of the
[00:59:27.400 --> 00:59:29.800]   folks that have been on the show are going to be in there and we're really
[00:59:29.800 --> 00:59:33.240]   we're digging really into both some of the business stuff what we see there but
[00:59:33.240 --> 00:59:35.960]   also especially for nab the some of the technology that
[00:59:35.960 --> 00:59:38.520]   specifically related to new media and distribution and
[00:59:38.520 --> 00:59:41.560]   the red camera a lot of us are talking about the red camera so what's the
[00:59:41.560 --> 00:59:44.440]   red camera well the red camera the the founder of
[00:59:44.440 --> 00:59:48.360]   oakley has put together uh he has been for the last five or six years
[00:59:48.360 --> 00:59:52.200]   sunglasses cameras well yeah well you know they they try to remind people that
[00:59:52.200 --> 00:59:56.200]   a he has a crazy camera buff and owns just about every hd camera under
[00:59:56.200 --> 01:00:00.120]   in existence and on top of that oakley isn't is an optical company
[01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:03.400]   and the big thing that that may happen and no one really knows what's going to
[01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:06.920]   happen but the big thing that may happen is that he doesn't have to protect any
[01:00:06.920 --> 01:00:09.560]   ground so when you look at the panasonic or sony
[01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:13.320]   they have to protect their their line the product lines that have you know the
[01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:16.120]   camera that i have that we shoot like mac break on or whatever
[01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:19.720]   on them you know if you walk into a store that that camera system is is a
[01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:23.480]   quarter million dollars uh and so the thing is is they have to protect that
[01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:26.040]   number even though obviously doesn't cost that much to make it
[01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:29.160]   uh and there's only 150 of them in the world so on so forth well what he's
[01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:32.280]   looking at doing is building a camera that if it comes out the way he says
[01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:35.160]   it's going to come out and on all the rumors they haven't said anything
[01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:39.000]   just all these rumors uh that it will shoot twice the resolution of the
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:43.320]   sony that we have that it will shoot it has variable frame rates up to i
[01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:46.840]   think 120 frames per second it does 2k or 4k
[01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:51.560]   it is it'll record both in the camera to a separate drive or just do straight
[01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:55.240]   fiber out it has all this stuff to it and it's going to cost
[01:00:55.240 --> 01:00:58.360]   you know with the lens the rumor of course no one will know until this
[01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:02.120]   morning in about eight hours i think it's gonna still cost less than a hundred
[01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:05.160]   thousand dollars right um in some people are rumoring it could be as
[01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:07.880]   little as 40 or 50 thousand now that doesn't mean a lot to
[01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:14.280]   keep a lot of people listening to twit but for for this kind of uh building
[01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:17.720]   ip production market that's a that's a really big deal and especially for
[01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:20.680]   filmmakers uh if it if it actually turns out and
[01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:23.160]   it's it's still gonna be untried it won't ship until the end of the year
[01:01:23.160 --> 01:01:25.880]   probably but that's what a lot of people are coming to
[01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:30.440]   to kind of see what what they're doing how about apple and that's all it's
[01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:34.440]   pro products for binary until traditionally traditionally this is a
[01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:37.960]   big this is when apple will normally uh rev
[01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:43.000]   their uh rev their software and hardware uh you know so there's the rumor is is
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:47.880]   you'll see a 17 inch um laptop there's rumors that the
[01:01:47.880 --> 01:01:52.040]   that the hardware will come out the the towers uh that would be nice
[01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:55.640]   well it's really hard for them to to promote final cut pro the new final
[01:01:55.640 --> 01:01:59.480]   cut pro and and some of the new pro apps without having a machine that can
[01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:02.200]   actually take advantage of them on the intel they really you know they were
[01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:05.400]   saying march though you do they were saying march for the dual binary for
[01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:09.640]   the pro apps so they're they're late no no the the the universal binary is
[01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:12.920]   shipping oh it is yeah so that that all the pro apps
[01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:16.280]   the pro apps there i mean obviously there's going to be a we most of us
[01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:20.360]   expect to see a final cut pro six uh we expect to see a lot of new new little
[01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:23.880]   features uh we expect apple to push even further towards
[01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:27.160]   supporting podcasting and ip tv we don't know exactly how they're going to do
[01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:31.960]   that but we expect to see some of that um on the far end of what could be
[01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:34.760]   expected a lot of people are hoping there's rumors that
[01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:39.240]   there if you dig into the apple core you'll you'll see that it in in if you
[01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:43.160]   look through some of the uh setups uh you know as 10 you'll see that it's
[01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:46.440]   actually able to address it's designed to address uh eight
[01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:49.320]   processors right now and so everyone keeps on wondering whether we're going
[01:02:49.320 --> 01:02:52.680]   to see a quad proct that has dual core i don't want that
[01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:56.600]   yeah yeah exactly ten thousand dollars and as long as i'm gonna do that i'm
[01:02:56.600 --> 01:03:00.600]   gonna get dual 30 inch displays why not yeah exactly so so no one knows what's
[01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:03.240]   what's going to happen but we will definitely see new stuff from apple
[01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:05.480]   what we see of course is all up in the air until
[01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:09.880]   probably later tonight or uh you know within the next two or three days well
[01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:13.560]   this week in the media uh comes out wednesday this week so wednesday night
[01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:15.400]   we're going to record it we're recording it there
[01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:19.000]   and uh and we will uh give you the lowdown and we've got a couple guys that are
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:22.760]   wandering around the first two days uh just doing a lot of rnd i get in on
[01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:25.400]   wednesday morning and then i'll walk around a little bit
[01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:30.440]   and i'll let you know i fly out you fly in i just want to see if r he releases
[01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:33.640]   a new 16 millimeter camera i mean how cool with that big
[01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:38.440]   yeah right yeah film it's it's the next film i've heard of that
[01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:43.240]   it's edited by people keeping your keeping your little digital heart
[01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:46.600]   because there's some part of you that loves the idea yet another film camera
[01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:50.360]   i love i love looking at film and i and i have to admit that the more digital i
[01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:53.240]   shoot the more i respect film because there's a certain look and feel that you
[01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:56.200]   get but i think most of us are kind of grappling with the
[01:03:56.200 --> 01:03:59.400]   reality that it's it's all you know it within the next 10 to
[01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:03.240]   15 years on the far end and 10 years on the shorter end
[01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:07.000]   uh the only place we'll see film is when we go to like a little artsy
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.880]   theater i mean it really is that's the direction it's going it's going to go
[01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:14.600]   there really fast by film yes and that's what codex trying to
[01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:16.440]   deal with at the moment well i want to wrap this up because
[01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:20.520]   patrick's got to go to his new tech meetings so uh thank you for being here
[01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:23.800]   patrick and give us a report from a nab effect uh it's too bad you're

[01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:22.600]   i may actually be at a race but i still think it's a good idea to go there
[01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:27.640]   and then and then we will be at podcast academy in june we'll be doing tWIT
[01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:31.240]   from yahoo we can i'm going to dress up like a chinese
[01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:33.880]   distant we'll just see what it'll be fun
[01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:38.840]   please for more somebody's gonna say it so i will we'll have roger dress up
[01:05:38.840 --> 01:05:42.280]   as a chinese he'd fit the part uh we'll be doing tWIT
[01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:45.720]   live there uh on uh i don't know what day that is
[01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:48.360]   the friday there more details on the tWits site 16
[01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:51.800]   senga say 15 16 15 why don't we ask the beloved tWIT
[01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:54.760]   listening audience whether or not they want us to go cover the thing oh yeah
[01:05:54.760 --> 01:05:58.680]   there you go yeah singularity yes no thumbs up thumbs down
[01:05:58.680 --> 01:06:02.840]   i i wanted to do it if i if i knew i could get ray and eric and that gang
[01:06:02.840 --> 01:06:05.640]   uh together i would do it but i'm having a little difficulty
[01:06:05.640 --> 01:06:09.480]   with their pr people getting them to do a podcast what is this tell the pr people
[01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:12.440]   to call your new phone number yeah one thing i'll know you know
[01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:16.760]   you're big media listen to this music while i yank your

[01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:17.080]   your office yes you've we've done some strange things in
[01:07:17.080 --> 01:07:20.760]   this first year i mean we've gone through some very big changes the live
[01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:25.880]   things and uh we're back to doing it the way we did the first episode ironically
[01:07:25.880 --> 01:07:30.680]   anyway oh cruel i already know cruel i already thank you patrick
[01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:35.960]   i have a great time in vegas watch out for a flingo drive
[01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:40.760]   it could be wacky this time of night now i'm twivering take care
[01:07:40.760 --> 01:07:44.200]   uh of course yeah patrick is part of dl tv but so is
[01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:47.240]   i'm going to hang up on patrick here if i can there so is
[01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:52.840]   um uh robert who i've somehow lost as well i don't know what happened he
[01:07:52.840 --> 01:07:57.480]   hung up too uh david preggers part of revision three of course kevin rose
[01:07:57.480 --> 01:08:01.400]   dig.com d i gg.com but kevin is kevin gonna do more system episodes
[01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:05.720]   david what's going on yes he is going to do more system
[01:08:05.720 --> 01:08:11.240]   episodes um a small rumor that uh he might not make a massive appearance in
[01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:14.760]   the next system episode but that's also a small rumor that there
[01:08:14.760 --> 01:08:20.360]   is another system episode that is in edit oh and and do you want to tell us
[01:08:20.360 --> 01:08:22.040]   anymore um
[01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:29.240]   i'm sure it's about the maker fair oh cool yeah in fact that's uh that's where
[01:08:29.240 --> 01:08:35.000]   he was today yes uh no we were all a bunch of us were down at the maker
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:38.200]   fair all day saturday it was a fantastic event um
[01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:41.320]   they had so many people there filled taron and a bunch of the people with
[01:08:41.320 --> 01:08:44.280]   oriley that helped do it and they got some sponsors together
[01:08:44.280 --> 01:08:46.760]   they did it down at the san mato fairgrounds they must have i mean they had
[01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:49.880]   a parking lot with parking people that are having to put everyone in there
[01:08:49.880 --> 01:08:54.040]   and i i think that they had over 10 000 people that's pretty damn impressive
[01:08:54.040 --> 01:08:57.880]   i heard there was a lot of fire there was a lot of fire um
[01:08:57.880 --> 01:09:01.560]   you know it's it's always cool to tinker around and like hack your router into
[01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:05.400]   a you know hack your uh flaming router into an 800
[01:09:05.400 --> 01:09:09.080]   router but there's also a lot of fun to be had by like making uh electrical
[01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:13.160]   arcs go across the room and blowing things up fun so you got that on video and
[01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:16.280]   we'll see that uh that's on video it's going to be all kinds of
[01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:20.680]   dmca violations um it's going to be long it's going to
[01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:23.480]   have a lot of stuff we're going to edit it and edit it and with the last thing
[01:09:23.480 --> 01:09:26.440]   we want to do is announce when it's coming out but we have it we just need
[01:09:26.440 --> 01:09:30.920]   to edit damn thing we want it to come out uh pretty darn soon so i mean if
[01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:33.960]   without promising anything within the next couple of weeks
[01:09:33.960 --> 01:09:36.760]   and cack is going great control alt chicken
[01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:41.320]   control chicken and then uh not this is a great announcement but i will
[01:09:41.320 --> 01:09:45.240]   announce that there will be more announcements forthcoming with regard
[01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:47.960]   to revision three you guys are you're creating more
[01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:50.920]   content than i am you guys are very busy i don't know you guys got you got a lot
[01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:54.040]   of stuff uh we're working on it we want to we want to
[01:09:54.040 --> 01:09:57.080]   have a podcast for every day of the week i think we're close
[01:09:57.080 --> 01:10:00.600]   one more you've already got uh you've got dick doing every day yeah well that's
[01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:03.400]   right we do have a daily one you know i wish more people listen to that because
[01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:07.320]   i really really love that i subscribed to every i i subscribe to it and i listen
[01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:12.520]   to probably about 25 of them because i look at what it's about and decide
[01:10:12.520 --> 01:10:15.880]   whether or not i want to hear about it so i'm a i'm a consistent listener don't
[01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:19.080]   you think it's fun though even if the product isn't that interesting it's
[01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:22.040]   just fun because dicks oh yeah well a lot of times it's a product i think is
[01:10:22.040 --> 01:10:25.000]   interesting or a product i like and if it's a product that i know i don't
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.880]   really care about i might skip it just because i don't know
[01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:30.600]   you're breaking my heart i just think dicks so funny
[01:10:30.600 --> 01:10:33.320]   that's great i love the new avatars you're i don't know what you want to call
[01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:38.360]   me yeah we're really great nitrous and i like i like floss that's great
[01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:41.320]   that shows fun we uh christ did it by himself uh
[01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:44.360]   this week with the interview with the commander taco of slash dot which is
[01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:47.400]   cool i've always been a big fan of christy's it's kind of a wacky
[01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:51.080]   podcast not not a traditional twit podcast and i liked your original music
[01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:53.400]   for it i don't know if you changed it up again yet or not you think we should
[01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:58.120]   keep it i kind of like it's that kind of dark it is dark it's not your peppy
[01:10:58.120 --> 01:11:00.600]   podcast music but i think no i don't have a problem i mean
[01:11:00.600 --> 01:11:03.160]   if you guys want to change the mood of it we might keep it whatever
[01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:06.360]   now that the actually the votes are pretty much in favor of keeping that
[01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:12.120]   crazy oh really slow weird music uh and then we're going to do a pilot on a
[01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:16.600]   biotech podcast in in about a week and i'm talking to somebody about doing a
[01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:19.320]   windows podcast and that that you know what's the pie what's the biotech is
[01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:23.080]   it's just about plugging us into computers or well it's kind of heavy i
[01:11:23.080 --> 01:11:25.720]   don't know if it's right for us uh and i'll be interested to see what the
[01:11:25.720 --> 01:11:28.920]   reaction is to it's a Yale researcher who called me
[01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:31.880]   uh and said you know because i had said i think we should do a biotech podcast
[01:11:31.880 --> 01:11:35.880]   it might be a little heavy duty i mean it's going to be hardcore biotech
[01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:38.200]   i think you can go really hard for represented
[01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:40.760]   it's like stem cell research kind of stuff yeah
[01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:46.040]   proteins stem cell cloning but it's i'm gonna you know i told him look i have
[01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:48.840]   to make it so we really want to make it so everybody can listen in and i
[01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:52.600]   don't want it to you know only be for by how tech researchers he said no no we
[01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:55.640]   can we can make it accessible it's actually stuff that stuff is really
[01:11:55.640 --> 01:12:00.040]   fascinating when you get someone who can describe it i worked on a case a legal
[01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:04.360]   case that was related to uh RNA and DNA replication and stuff and
[01:12:04.360 --> 01:12:08.200]   you're likely to do uh visual visualization right for court
[01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:11.800]   and uh and it was fascinating i was one of my favorite things was you you'd
[01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:14.920]   have someone who would then bring it down to layman's terms because they have to
[01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:17.880]   talk to the jury about it well that's going to be the challenge you bet
[01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:21.720]   in if you find someone who can bring that down to layman's terms i mean a lot
[01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:24.920]   of how all this stuff works and how they how they uh you know figure
[01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:27.400]   how they figure it out and how they slice up the DNA and
[01:12:27.400 --> 01:12:29.400]   how they do all this stuff is really really cool
[01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:32.360]   well one of the reasons i want to do it is i really think that's where the
[01:12:32.360 --> 01:12:34.920]   future is i mean the the info tech revolution has been
[01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:37.400]   important but wait till we get to biotech
[01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:40.680]   uh and and then combine the two and it's just going to be incredible so
[01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:44.520]   oh the crossover though right now i mean there's that one company in
[01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:48.600]   the silicon valley that makes those actual chips that they've
[01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:52.600]   uh run fluid across and they're able to do DNA or uh
[01:12:52.600 --> 01:12:56.680]   protein analysis and oh what's the other genetic analysis bay but
[01:12:56.680 --> 01:12:59.960]   basically at speeds never before thought possible and
[01:12:59.960 --> 01:13:02.680]   i guess they could look at something like a hundred thousand
[01:13:02.680 --> 01:13:06.280]   base pairs of proteins per sample with the first generation of the tool and
[01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:10.280]   now that's being quadrupled so that it's just
[01:13:10.280 --> 01:13:13.720]   for me it's impressive it's it's going far beyond
[01:13:13.720 --> 01:13:16.600]   i mean just just the speed at which they're able to look at the
[01:13:16.600 --> 01:13:20.280]   you know what makes things tick on a biological level is just
[01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:22.920]   it goes hand in hand with the uh silicon valley's
[01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:26.440]   computer industry as well now right i think it's very significant i think
[01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:28.920]   it's very significant i wish i could think of the name of the company
[01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:33.880]   that's doing it has some oh crazy tech no sounding name but it's just uh
[01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:37.800]   tune into the only tune into our show fib it's going to be called futures in
[01:13:37.800 --> 01:13:42.040]   biotech futures in biotech yeah very cool and uh it's a pilot so
[01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:44.360]   i'm not you know i just want to see what we can do and see if there's an
[01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:47.640]   interest in it so if people like it that'll be uh not next week i'm in
[01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:51.800]   Canada this week but it'll be uh may week of may first
[01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:54.840]   so i'm i'm gonna race with you david to see if you can come up with more
[01:13:54.840 --> 01:13:57.800]   programs faster i have an advantage though because i do
[01:13:57.800 --> 01:14:01.160]   audio it's a little easy to crank out audio that it is to crank out video
[01:14:01.160 --> 01:14:03.960]   i do have to admit that between between doing mac break and uh
[01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:06.360]   and some of the other shows that we're kind of playing with and doing uh
[01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:09.960]   this weekend media it's a lot easier to get me is just a breeze you know
[01:14:09.960 --> 01:14:13.160]   it's just uh the audio is much easier i'm an audio guy that's why i like
[01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:16.120]   audio now how is mac break doing when's the next episode coming out next
[01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:19.960]   right next episode will come out next week um we are uh i'm gonna be doing a
[01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:23.480]   the road to tenety p part three so talking about the final behind the
[01:14:23.480 --> 01:14:26.760]   scene stuff and then we've got one with the finally the one with sal
[01:14:26.760 --> 01:14:29.560]   is just uh it's about finished as well so we're going to posting that one
[01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:32.440]   next week or the week after an incredible apple script and automated
[01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:35.960]   down oh my gosh it's just 25 minutes and it's just uh
[01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:39.880]   he's clearly really fantastic stuff he's just fantastic and so we're gonna
[01:14:39.880 --> 01:14:43.080]   have him on and then we're probably going to do an na-b special as well
[01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:46.200]   so that was lots more coming up yeah a whole bunch of mac break
[01:14:46.200 --> 01:14:50.760]   we're out of time guys we got to wrap this up dl tv that's where robert lives
[01:14:50.760 --> 01:14:55.240]   of course Alex Lindsay is the head honcho over at the pixel core and they do
[01:14:55.240 --> 01:14:58.600]   are so many great things but the latest is this weekend media and we'll look
[01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:02.760]   for that na-b report on wednesday david pregert revision three control all
[01:15:02.760 --> 01:15:06.200]   chicken system many other things in the works
[01:15:06.200 --> 01:15:09.880]   when's the next uh episode of in digital coming out
[01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:12.360]   the next episode of in digital is actually not going to come out until
