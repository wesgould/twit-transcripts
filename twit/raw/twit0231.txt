[00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.680]   It's time for Twitt this Week in Tech.
[00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.600]   The stories are true.
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.640]   The names have been changed to protect the ignorant.
[00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.760]   Ladies and gentlemen, Patrick Bezha is here from France.
[00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.880]   And Patrick Bezha is not my real name, as you just said.
[00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.280]   Well, to protect you.
[00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.040]   It's OK.
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:45.680]   Absolutely.
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.080]   You can use a pseudonym here.
[00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.320]   Patrick does the incredible Philius podcast, which
[00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:58.200]   is an English language podcast out of Paris, that is kind of like Twitt Euro-style, right?
[00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.560]   Yep.
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.760]   It's like the Twitt of political and international news, kind of.
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.760]   And actually, you do other shows too.
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:06.640]   There's a movie show.
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.080]   What's the site for all of that?
[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.640]   You can go to frenchspin.com to see all of that.
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.360]   But maybe I'll tell you a little bit more about a new project
[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.320]   that we're developing at the end of the show.
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.820]   Sure.
[00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.360]   I'd love to hear about it.
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:26.160]   Also here to regale us with great stories from the good old days.
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.480]   John C. Devorek?
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.600]   Yeah, the good old days last week.
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.200]   Neither John or Patrick went to CES.
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.720]   And that's why you both are here.
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:38.240]   Right.
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.280]   Well, we don't need to go.
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.240]   Leo, you were there.
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.280]   Oh, man.
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.600]   I think I killed my staff.
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.960]   I think they actually were this close to rebelling and leaving me there.
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.920]   As long as they didn't poison you.
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:50.520]   They may have.
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.440]   I came home and I was sick as a dog.
[00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.000]   So yeah, they may have.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   I always get sick.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.200]   From what?
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.040]   Well, I had a meatball sandwich at the Vegas McCarran Field.
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.080]   That might have been a mistake.
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.520]   Geez.
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.600]   Those meatballs had been there since Wayne Newton was a headliner.
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.840]   I mean, they could have been Wayne Newton for all you know.
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.000]   You know, it's what's left.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.600]   It was either Siegfried or Roy.
[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:15.240]   I'm not sure.
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.080]   But it was somebody's.
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.360]   And who they were not good.
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.880]   But I'm back.
[00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.880]   Those are the ones that I tell Leo about the mouse clarification.
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.200]   Oh, is this have to do with the fact that 25 years ago you said the mouse would never
[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.200]   go anywhere?
[00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.200]   What is this?
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:39.480]   No, it just has to do with Philip Elmer with wrote that piece that got passed around.
[00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.800]   And I finally found the original column.
[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:43.800]   And then I--
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.080]   This is something we talked about a couple of weeks ago.
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.600]   Yeah.
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:47.600]   What was the piece?
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.360]   This is more interesting because he went back and changed his column and CNN and blanked
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.440]   out all the stuff that nobody knows where this phony quote came from.
[00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.120]   Well, we can fill this in because not everybody listens to every show.
[00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.120]   What was the initial--
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.120]   Let me get the link and then so I can look at it.
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.120]   Yeah.
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.120]   Of course, I can give it to you.
[00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.120]   I remember talking about this, but I'll be honest.
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.480]   I don't really-- I would fill you in myself, but I don't really remember myself.
[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.680]   It just happened like last night.
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.080]   So Philip Elmer DeWitt is a writer.
[00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.120]   He was time-- he worked at Time magazine.
[00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.000]   Covers the Macintosh.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.120]   I don't know if he's still at Time magazine.
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.560]   I think it maybe still works for-- he must still work for Fortune CNN because he went
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.280]   back and changed the column last night.
[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.040]   So is this Microsoft Upstage's Apple's tablet?
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.800]   Is Fortune's Philip Elmer DeWitt nuts that story?
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.480]   Today's proof that there's always someone who doesn't get it comes in the form of fortunes,
[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.080]   usually much more reliable Philip Elmer DeWitt.
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:51.000]   After a laugh-inducing headline video, Microsoft Upstage's Apple's tablet, Elmer DeWitt writes,
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:58.400]   "Steve Balmer's keynote at the CES show in Vegas ran for more than an hour and a quarter.
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.440]   But what got the most attention from the press gathered to watch it with the three minutes
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:06.960]   Microsoft CEO spent talking about his answer to the tablet computer Apple is expected to
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.600]   release in less than three weeks."
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.160]   That's just--
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.520]   If that was Microsoft's answer, we don't want to know the question.
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.600]   Virtually everyone on the planet who saw Balmer's presentation saw it the same way except for
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:25.520]   Phil, Elmer DeWitt writes, "In a subtle dig it is competitors in Cupertino.
[00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:32.360]   He demoed the HP Slate with an Amazon Kindle version of Stephanie Miller's Twilight.
[00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:38.480]   The book's cover shows a pair of hands cradling an Apple."
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:45.480]   Is that what you're talking about John or is this another thing he got wrong?
[00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.280]   No, this--
[00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.680]   Here, Google--
[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:54.040]   No, I just had it--
[00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:57.760]   Steve Balmer's keynote at the CES show in Vegas Wednesday ran for more than an hour
[00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:58.920]   and a quarter.
[00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:59.920]   But the press went--
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:00.920]   Here it is.
[00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:01.920]   Here it is.
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:04.440]   Google DeWitt-DeVorac, D-E-W-I-T-T-DeVorac.
[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:09.440]   It's about this eighth story down January, 1984, how critics reviewed the Mac.
[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:12.440]   Oh, this is when he's talking about you.
[00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:13.440]   Yeah.
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:20.520]   Now, if you see, he's changed the column and I thank him for doing this, by the way.
[00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.640]   So this is another column.
[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:30.800]   It is the 25th anniversary of the Apple ad in the Super Bowl, which was 1984, January
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.080]   22nd, 1984.
[00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:38.280]   So he wrote a column in Fortune, in which he says in anticipating the anniversary, "I
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:44.720]   have some choice quotes from the first wave of critical reviews of the Macintosh."
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:45.720]   And I've scrolled down.
[00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:49.360]   You know, Bight says, "The Mac brings us one step closer to the ideal of computer as
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.960]   appliance, creative computing.
[00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:56.120]   John Anderson said, "You know, won't want the task.
[00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:57.600]   You can't use the Mac away from a desk.
[00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:58.600]   It's slow.
[00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:04.120]   If Ram Bill Gates says anyone who could write a good application on a 128K Mac deserves a
[00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:05.120]   metal."
[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:06.120]   But he quoted you.
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:08.120]   You see, that's gone.
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:12.360]   No, it's the Amherstysko Examiner, John C. DeVorac.
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:13.360]   Keep going.
[00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:14.360]   It's in there.
[00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:15.360]   There it is.
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:16.360]   Now, he's got some stuff struck out.
[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:17.360]   Yeah.
[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:18.360]   This is all bogus.
[00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:19.360]   Somebody made up.
[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:20.600]   This is not a quote from you?
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:22.560]   No, that's why it's all mixed out.
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:26.160]   The only thing I ever said was the Macintosh uses an experimental pointing device called
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:27.160]   a mouse.
[00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.160]   There's no evidence that people want to use these things.
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.160]   That's all I said.
[00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.160]   Quite famous.
[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:34.280]   I didn't say I don't want one of these new fangled devices.
[00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:36.000]   This is what they said you said.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.200]   I'll say it in the voice they want you to be saying it in.
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:44.520]   The nature of the personal computer is simply not fully understood by companies like Apple
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:46.600]   or anyone else for that matter.
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:50.600]   Apple makes the arrogant assumption of thinking that it knows what you want to need.
[00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:55.080]   Unfortunately, it leaves the Y out of the equation as in, "Why would I want this?"
[00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:56.680]   "I don't want one of the..."
[00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:57.680]   This is the Tech Grouch.
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.480]   "I don't want one of these new fangled devices."
[00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:03.160]   I think the Tech Grouch might say that.
[00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:04.920]   I think it's complete and accurate.
[00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:08.400]   Apple does make the assumption that it knows what you want to need.
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:09.400]   That's completely true.
[00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:11.840]   Now, John, did you get a Mac early on?
[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:12.840]   I had one right from the beginning.
[00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:13.840]   Yeah.
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:17.000]   In fact, I still have one of the 128s that have all the signatures inside the box.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.760]   Oh, that's worth something now.
[00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:23.120]   They had everybody who was on the Mac team sign the mold.
[00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:24.120]   Then they made the mold.
[00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:29.760]   I bought a 128K Mac March of 1984.
[00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:31.880]   Little after this review came out, a month after this review came out.
[00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:35.680]   I remember going to Macy's is where I got it because I had a Macy's charge card and
[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:38.000]   it was $2,500.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:44.040]   I plunked down the plastic and I probably paid for that thing for 10 years.
[00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:45.520]   You know what?
[00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:52.360]   In hindsight, it was the beginning of the Kool-Aid because you couldn't copy a floppy
[00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:55.080]   without 50 swaps.
[00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:57.640]   You couldn't save because you had the Mac write disk in there.
[00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:02.640]   You'd have to create a document that can eject the program disk, save it, then put the program
[00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:04.120]   disk back in.
[00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:05.800]   There was no button to eject.
[00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:08.760]   You had to eject in software, something Apple still does.
[00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:13.040]   Actually, because there's an eject button now on them.
[00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:14.040]   So what do you think?
[00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:16.280]   Now, here we are 25 years later.
[00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:17.880]   Will the Mac make it, John?
[00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:21.280]   It has a good shot at it.
[00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:22.280]   How about the mouse?
[00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:25.840]   The mouse I, by the way, I just wrote a column.
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:31.440]   I think it was in PC Magazine and I think the mouse may eventually with his touchscreen
[00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:37.360]   machines coming out, at some point the mouse may be dead in this whole point and moot.
[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:38.360]   Wow.
[00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:41.440]   Now, by the way, you could rectoactively declare yourself correct.
[00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:45.440]   I'm not going to buy a wrench from that column in terms of bogus PR than anything I've ever
[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:48.920]   done, including my dinner with IBM, which had a lot of legs.
[00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:50.160]   That's a very good point.
[00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.720]   Or you're singing Barney, which apparently has one point.
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.840]   The Barney thing is, well, that's in a different league.
[00:09:54.840 --> 00:10:01.560]   In 1.2 million views on YouTube from John's three years ago recording a Barney doll singing
[00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:03.240]   I Love You and his bathtub.
[00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:04.240]   And that's it.
[00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:05.240]   That's it.
[00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:08.800]   No editing, no lighting.
[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:09.800]   Why bother?
[00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:10.800]   Why bother?
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:12.200]   I don't even know why we do this show.
[00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:16.920]   I'm just going to record my stuffed animal singing and I'm done.
[00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:20.720]   So let's talk about the big story of the week.
[00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:25.400]   And I'm not talking about the Conan O'Brien fraca.
[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:28.600]   I'm talking about Google and China.
[00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:34.760]   Now one of the reasons I wanted to get you on Patrick Bejah is to get a world point of
[00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:38.800]   view on this because in some ways people are saying Google is acting almost as an
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:43.160]   extra national as you know, the Google has a foreign policy.
[00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:46.280]   And I'm just wondering if how that plays to the rest of the world.
[00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:48.600]   We're going to talk about it in just a second before we do though.
[00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:52.520]   I want to thank one of our sponsors, the folks at Citrix who do GoToMeeting, a great
[00:10:52.520 --> 00:11:00.320]   product for saving time, saving travel with GoToMeeting, could do more and travel less.
[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:04.080]   These guys do also go to my PC and go to assist.
[00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.600]   They're very good at remote access.
[00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:12.840]   So the idea of GoToMeeting is, in fact, you go there right now, GoToMeeting.com/Twit.
[00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:15.360]   You can install GoToMeeting on your computer.
[00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:19.640]   Mac or PC, it'll take about three minutes.
[00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:23.400]   Just blowing his nose.
[00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:27.400]   To be honest, I think John's doing a costume change right now because his screen has got
[00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:29.600]   dark.
[00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:32.520]   Patrick, I should have warned you.
[00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:38.360]   Whenever there's a commercial, John decides to take advantage of that moment to do something
[00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:39.440]   else.
[00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:43.280]   If you go to GoToMeeting.com/Twit, you can have meetings right from your desk.
[00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:46.200]   You can do PowerPoint presentations, product demos.
[00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:50.040]   You could do collaboration, training, works wonderfully.
[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:52.600]   And I want you to try it free right now.
[00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:55.920]   $49 a month for unlimited meetings as often as you want, as long as you want.
[00:11:55.920 --> 00:12:00.680]   And it includes voiceover, the internet and free telephony.
[00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:02.760]   Go to GoToMeeting.com/Twit.
[00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:05.240]   Install this right now and let us know what you think of it.
[00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:06.240]   You can't go wrong.
[00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:07.240]   30 days free.
[00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:08.240]   GoToMeeting.com/Twit.
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:10.960]   We thank you for their support.
[00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:12.440]   John is still not there.
[00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:16.040]   I wonder what's going on.
[00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:17.040]   So there we go.
[00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:20.200]   He's removed the modesty panel.
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:26.640]   It's the cone of silence.
[00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:28.440]   I did a column in MarketWatch.com.
[00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:32.280]   If you go to MarketWatch.com right now for people in the chat room, you can see there's
[00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:37.760]   a big ugly picture of me there on the front page under commentary.
[00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:41.640]   I wrote about this Google situation with a different take.
[00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:42.840]   I think it's fascinating.
[00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:45.840]   So just to recap, I'm sure everybody's heard this.
[00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:46.840]   Down a little more.
[00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:48.760]   Down a little more.
[00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:49.760]   Down, down.
[00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:50.760]   There it is.
[00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:51.760]   There it is.
[00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:52.760]   That's a good picture of you.
[00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:53.760]   Just like this.
[00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:54.760]   Yeah.
[00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:56.440]   Google's at risk by not leaving China.
[00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:58.240]   So here's the deal.
[00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:00.840]   On Tuesday, this has been going on for some time.
[00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:05.200]   Google, in fact, now we know had meetings Christmas Eve.
[00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:11.680]   Eric Schmidt, who the story goes, has been the strongest advocate of Google cooperating
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:13.960]   with the Chinese authorities with being in China.
[00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:17.760]   They've been there for four years, filtering search results at the behest of the Chinese
[00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:21.200]   government following the Chinese government's law, we should say.
[00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:24.600]   But never gave any information about dissidents to China.
[00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:25.600]   In fact, was smart.
[00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:28.280]   They kept their servers out of China.
[00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:31.680]   They had those search servers there, but the Gmail servers, the Doc servers were all
[00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:35.280]   overseas, so they weren't required to give any information to the Chinese government.
[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:36.480]   They made it unlike Yahoo.
[00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:38.720]   They managed not to.
[00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:44.560]   But starting at some point, and it depends who you read, could be anywhere from 2001 to
[00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:53.320]   July, hackers started breaking into Google's servers in the US trying to steal information
[00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:57.200]   about dissidents, trying to steal source code.
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:02.800]   People around about December discovered these intrusions, tracked them down.
[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:07.480]   They clearly believed, according to a blog post that came out on Tuesday, it was the
[00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:09.640]   Chinese government doing it.
[00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:16.560]   They say furthermore that as many as 30 US countries have been similarly hacked, that
[00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:21.400]   human rights advocates outside of China's Gmail accounts have been compromised through
[00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:27.800]   uses of spearfishing, malware, other scams like that, not breaking into Google servers,
[00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:32.320]   but actually hacking these people with targeted attacks.
[00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:35.920]   And essentially Google said enough is enough.
[00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:41.520]   If China does this, since China has done this, we have been given no choice.
[00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:43.000]   We are going to give them two choices.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.680]   We're going to say change your laws and let us operate unfettered in China, or we will
[00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:47.680]   exit.
[00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:52.360]   Is that accurate, John, as to what happened?
[00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:54.280]   That's what is reported.
[00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:57.360]   I'm not absolutely sure that any of this actually happened.
[00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:58.360]   Why not?
[00:14:58.360 --> 00:14:59.360]   Because of the China hack.
[00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:00.800]   What do you think happened?
[00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:05.680]   Well, I don't say I don't know what happened because Google's not very forthcoming.
[00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:07.760]   They don't even have a press release out on this.
[00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:09.240]   But I do know this much.
[00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:13.680]   They had to get out of China because if they were going to be forced to give China special
[00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:17.280]   treatment for its search engine, just so it could be there.
[00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:19.240]   Which they've been doing for four years.
[00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:20.640]   Yes, I know.
[00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:23.920]   Somebody finally figured out that if they keep doing it this way, because they were starting
[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:28.520]   to gain market share on Baidu over the past six months to the point where they were almost
[00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:30.000]   getting up to 50 percent.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.920]   They're up to 40, I think.
[00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:38.800]   They realized that they would put themselves in a tremendous bind in the future if the majority
[00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:44.480]   of their income started to come from China because at some point the Chinese could say,
[00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:50.640]   hey, wait a minute, now that you're getting most of your money from us, we want to mention
[00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:51.640]   something to you.
[00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:55.880]   Maybe you should stop, take those anti-Chinese websites that you show to people every place
[00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:56.880]   else in the world.
[00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:58.880]   Maybe you should stop doing that.
[00:15:58.880 --> 00:15:59.880]   Around the world.
[00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:01.200]   Not just in China, but around the world.
[00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:02.200]   Yeah.
[00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:06.400]   And they could load it over and pull the plug late in the game, which would sink the Google
[00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:09.080]   stock and almost ruin the company.
[00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:10.760]   Google has to go about to some other way.
[00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:13.880]   So it has to get out of China under these rules.
[00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:14.880]   Very interesting.
[00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:15.880]   That makes sense, Patrick.
[00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:17.680]   Does that make sense to you?
[00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:19.080]   I'm not certain it does.
[00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:24.400]   I mean, well, maybe they could exit more gracefully in the future, but it seems like a pretty
[00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:32.000]   drastic response to be saying goodbye to all that income just now with 40 percent of the
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.520]   market now in China and maybe more in the future.
[00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:40.240]   They're saying goodbye now to all that money just because in the future it might become
[00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:43.640]   a problem with censorship.
[00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:48.040]   Maybe since everyone else is still doing it, it doesn't seem to bother everyone else.
[00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:50.960]   There must be some other component to this.
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:54.400]   You know, I think that there were internal divisions at Google.
[00:16:54.400 --> 00:17:00.680]   I mean, Ken Auleda and others are saying that Eric Schmidt always wanted to be in China,
[00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:05.840]   continued to want to be in China, even at that Christmas Eve meeting that Sergey Brin,
[00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:10.520]   one of the founders of Google, has never been comfortable with being in China and that
[00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:16.400]   this gave Sergey the ammunition he needed to finally say, "Look, guys, we cannot do business
[00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:22.440]   with a partner that spies on us, that attacks us, that's attempting to break into our servers."
[00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:23.440]   I think you're right, John.
[00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:25.800]   I mean, I think they probably did look down the road and said it, and it's only going
[00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:30.520]   to get worse, but I think that they, this gave Sergey the ammunition he needed to finally
[00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:33.640]   win this battle with Eric Schmidt and maybe even the board.
[00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:34.640]   Who knows?
[00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:37.080]   Well, I gave him the excuse they needed is what it was.
[00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:40.920]   Well, and the thing with one of the things we raised in the, this week in Google show
[00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:46.000]   yesterday, one of the things I raised is it's very convenient for Google for a number of
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   reasons.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:52.240]   First of all, they've managed to deflect kind of an important point, which is that they
[00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:53.800]   were hacked.
[00:17:53.800 --> 00:18:00.480]   You know, all the attention is on Google taking a stand, people applauding Google for, you
[00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:06.160]   know, standing up to China, which completely distracts from the bigger issue, which is
[00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:07.640]   when it was compromised.
[00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:10.440]   The cloud it was compromised.
[00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:14.520]   There was a number of attacks, but were they actually, were the attacks successful?
[00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:16.880]   Yes, Google admits they were successful.
[00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:17.880]   Yeah.
[00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:22.320]   Well, Google says no information about dissidents was released.
[00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:27.920]   The hackers never got into Gmail accounts, but they did manage to get some account information
[00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:31.760]   and they apparently got some intellectual property, including source code.
[00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:34.600]   So no, there was a successful attack.
[00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:39.880]   The secretary of state, Hillary Clinton released a statement that evening, Tuesday evening,
[00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:44.680]   saying effectively, you've got to explain some splaining to do.
[00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:48.840]   She asked the Chinese government to explain itself, saying that Google's allegations,
[00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:52.680]   quote, raise very serious concerns and questions.
[00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:57.160]   The ability to cooperate with confidence and cyber spaces critical in a modern society
[00:18:57.160 --> 00:19:03.240]   and economy end, quote, and Thursday, she's going to have an address specifically on this.
[00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:08.040]   Google also says this is according to the blog posting by Google Chief Legal Officer David
[00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:09.040]   Drummond.
[00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:13.440]   I think it's telling that it was the legal beagle that announced this.
[00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:16.320]   First quote, first, this attack was not just on Google.
[00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:20.000]   As part of our investigation, we've discovered that at least 20 other large companies, by
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.760]   the way, that number is now, I think, 30 from a wide range of businesses and includes Adobe,
[00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:29.080]   by the way, including the internet, finance, technology, media and chemical sectors have
[00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:30.520]   been similarly targeted.
[00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:34.120]   Second, we have evidence to suggest that a primary goal of the attackers was accessing
[00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:37.480]   the Gmail accounts of Chinese human right activists.
[00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:39.920]   It does.
[00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:44.480]   You know, you were asking what it, the way we approached it here in France.
[00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:48.280]   And the first thing that came up, I think maybe it was early in the game when we weren't
[00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:52.600]   sure of the scope of the attack and the origin of the attack.
[00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:57.120]   Everyone thought it was China, but we weren't sure as much as we are now.
[00:19:57.120 --> 00:20:03.320]   The first question that came up was, is Google doing this for moral reasons?
[00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:06.560]   Are they upholding their, "Don't be evil"?
[00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:11.960]   Yeah, that's a good question because they put up with Chinese regulation for four years
[00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:14.920]   and now all of a sudden they get a spine.
[00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:16.520]   Well, it does.
[00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:21.560]   Certainly there is an ulterior motive and it might very well be what John is talking
[00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:29.080]   about, but I do think that there is also something else which is somewhere in the company possibly
[00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:34.400]   Sergei, there is a moral compass in a way that there isn't in any other company because
[00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:39.400]   I don't think given China's market that it would even be a question at Microsoft.
[00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:44.240]   I mean, maybe I'm wrong, but can you even imagine Microsoft thinking, "Well, you know
[00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:48.240]   what, the Chinese government isn't super playing super nice with us, so we're going
[00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:52.560]   to leave and leave all that pile of money on the ground."
[00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:56.240]   Somebody in the chat was asking a good question, isn't this almost a tantamount to an act
[00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:57.240]   of war?
[00:20:57.240 --> 00:21:00.400]   You know, it's funny is that, well, here's the funny thing.
[00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:01.640]   How's it an act of war?
[00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:02.800]   I go to China, visit.
[00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:04.520]   I don't like the place I leave.
[00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:08.080]   No, the act of war from China attacking our infrastructure.
[00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:13.160]   I'll tell you, here's the funny thing is that we discovered, I remember this in September,
[00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:17.800]   that the federal government announced that American infrastructure, the electrical grid
[00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:23.600]   independent electrical companies had been attacked, that they found Trojan horses on
[00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:26.720]   many of those computers.
[00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:30.520]   It was at the time, I think it was widely suspected it was China.
[00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:38.360]   Of course, China had that operation hacking the Dylai Lama, and there was not nearly
[00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:39.960]   the fuhrer that there is now.
[00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:44.800]   It says, "Hey, you can attack our electrical grid," which really is an act of war.
[00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:46.400]   Go ahead, but attack Google.
[00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:47.400]   Hey.
[00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:50.120]   Don't mess with Google.
[00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:55.080]   I think it's a little easy for Google at this point, because they deflect from the fact
[00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:56.080]   that they were hacked.
[00:21:56.080 --> 00:22:00.640]   And also, if Google's got, there's a lot of attention lately with people, and I don't
[00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:03.720]   know how it is in France, but I suspect this is the same there, with people saying, "I
[00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:06.880]   am not sure if we trust Google."
[00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:11.320]   I think Google needed something like this to kind of reassert their moral authority,
[00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:12.800]   "Oh, you can trust us."
[00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:13.800]   So it's very convenient.
[00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:18.200]   Yeah, the whole thing makes me think the whole thing is of charade.
[00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:20.720]   But that said, by the way, we also do this.
[00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:25.640]   Americans do this kind of stuff too, always nosing around other people's systems.
[00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:28.280]   That may be why we didn't say anything, huh?
[00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:33.120]   But the fact of the Chinese, I mean, is the Chinese, what you're telling, what the endpoint
[00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:37.520]   message is, is the cloud is not safe, and the Chinese can't seem to do this without getting
[00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:38.520]   caught.
[00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:44.080]   Or they were doing it a long time, and Google finally sus to it.
[00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:48.000]   Yeah, that's actually what I also suggest in the column, that it's been going on.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.840]   A lot of experts say it's been going on since 2001.
[00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:55.200]   To that extent, in that scale?
[00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:57.040]   I don't know.
[00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:58.040]   You know.
[00:22:58.040 --> 00:22:59.040]   Lots of unknown, right?
[00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:02.680]   Now in France, and I think this is true of the EU in general, this mistrust of Google
[00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:03.680]   is not new.
[00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:04.840]   In fact, the EU has been going after Google.
[00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:09.040]   In fact, the French government said it's going to, on Thursday, that it was thinking of taxing
[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:10.040]   Google.
[00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:12.680]   Yes, that's a hilarious story.
[00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:13.680]   But yeah.
[00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:16.680]   It's now this is this is this is okay.
[00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:22.920]   Now I'm not one of those guys that says France socialist bad, but this is a little bit of
[00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:23.920]   a stereotype.
[00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:29.560]   The French government is considering a Google tax that would help level the playing field
[00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:35.240]   between internet portals that offer free content and the music film and publishing industries
[00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:37.840]   that lost revenue because of it.
[00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:41.120]   It's not exactly the government proposing this.
[00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:42.600]   It's a sort of a.
[00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:44.080]   It said it, didn't it?
[00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:45.320]   Well, not exactly.
[00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:51.600]   There's basically a study that was conducted by a guy who works for the music industry about
[00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:59.040]   the ways that we can improve the cultural offerings on the internet.
[00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:07.160]   And one thing that he suggested amongst many others was this idea that someone is making
[00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:08.680]   lots of money on the internet.
[00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:16.640]   Let's tax them to do something else to promote music and other things.
[00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:22.980]   It might get somewhat proposed in a law somewhere in the government, but it's so completely
[00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:26.880]   asinine that the EU is never going to let that fly.
[00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:28.320]   It's ridiculous.
[00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:30.960]   It has no grounds whatsoever about any.
[00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:36.520]   He also said the possibly dominant position Google has acquired in the online ad market
[00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:39.760]   should be officially investigated for any unfair practices.
[00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:41.960]   There's definitely an anti Google.
[00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:44.680]   And I was supposed it's anti US.
[00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:46.680]   I think it is.
[00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:50.480]   It's this guy who is a music industry guy who is.
[00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:53.840]   That was our co that was your president talking.
[00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:58.920]   Okay, he is not the super biggest fan of the internet either.
[00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:03.560]   It's just, you know, he's the guy who pushed for the three strikes law.
[00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:06.600]   But which went into effect this week as well.
[00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:07.600]   Yes, it did.
[00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:08.600]   It did.
[00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:09.600]   Yeah.
[00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:10.600]   It's a catastrophe.
[00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:11.600]   It's a disaster.
[00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:13.680]   But it's never going to be actually enforceable.
[00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:17.400]   Do you see that story about the three strikes law thing?
[00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:24.800]   They actually for the logo through a series of missteps ended up using illegally a font
[00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:27.440]   that didn't belong to them.
[00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:33.600]   So the poster for the law broke copyright law.
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:41.120]   The logo for the government body called adopi was designed by a firm to use a font that
[00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:47.160]   belongs to orange, you know, the telecom company.
[00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:49.680]   And they designed the logo with that font.
[00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:53.360]   And when they the logo came out, it was like, well, try this.
[00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:56.440]   So this is a disaster.
[00:25:56.440 --> 00:26:02.920]   The Google tax thing is never it's most probably not even constitutional in the concept.
[00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:08.520]   Why would you tax Google on the internet and not people, you know, the ad companies in
[00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:12.720]   the street who display ads on posters and banners and stuff like that.
[00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:13.720]   It's never going to go.
[00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:14.720]   Well, I would.
[00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:15.600]   I think it's never going to go through.
[00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:22.520]   But it's it pretty much shows you how ridiculous we are when we go about thinking of these
[00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:23.520]   things.
[00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:29.720]   And more than France and socialism, I think it shows how people in this country and probably
[00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:33.120]   others don't understand the way it works.
[00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:35.240]   They don't know what this internet thing is.
[00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:37.400]   And they still don't know how they can make money out of it.
[00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:41.120]   So they're thinking, let's take the money from the guy actually makes money.
[00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:42.120]   Taxics.
[00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:43.120]   Why not?
[00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:45.560]   I like to see a per click tax.
[00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:46.560]   It's not much.
[00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:48.520]   Just a quarter quarter cent per click.
[00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:50.240]   One song team on some team.
[00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:51.240]   Percreek.
[00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:52.240]   Yeah.
[00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:54.840]   Do the rest of the show.
[00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:57.800]   No, that's like we're.
[00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:00.440]   Oh, I'm used to it.
[00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:01.440]   Yeah.
[00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:02.440]   Yeah.
[00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:05.480]   But going back to the Google thing, I have a question.
[00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:10.120]   Do you guys does this Google getting out of China for whatever reason?
[00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:16.760]   If it's an excuse, if it's a good point at this point to get out for various reasons,
[00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:20.080]   does it make you like Google more or does it not change your opinion?
[00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:21.520]   Oh, no, it makes me like Google more.
[00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:27.160]   I think, in fact, I would say if I you pulled the blogosphere on Tuesday, it was a resounding
[00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:29.480]   applause for Google right on Google.
[00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:30.480]   You're doing the right thing.
[00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:31.480]   Go for it, Google.
[00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:32.480]   Right.
[00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:35.280]   I can't get behind that kind of thinking personally.
[00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:37.600]   I like Google just the way I like Google.
[00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:40.200]   I don't like them more.
[00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:41.680]   Well, don't you think though, this is Google?
[00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:47.960]   I have to say and and if a better search engine came along, I'd bail out in a minute.
[00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:50.800]   But now, now, first of all, let me underscore this is more than search when Google pulls
[00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:52.320]   out of China.
[00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:53.480]   It's Google Docs.
[00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:54.480]   It's Google mail.
[00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:55.480]   It's Google voice.
[00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:57.400]   It's all of the it's all of the Google tools.
[00:27:57.400 --> 00:28:01.440]   Now you may say, yeah, Google's only a, you know, less than half of the search market.
[00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:06.320]   But let me tell you the intelligentsia, the university students, they in the cities of
[00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:10.080]   China, they use these Google tools heavily.
[00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:12.600]   That's why China's breaking into Gmail.
[00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:15.000]   They're trying to get the dissidents email accounts.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:16.120]   So that's a big deal.
[00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:19.760]   These people, you know, that's a, what if Google pulled out of the US?
[00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:21.440]   What if you couldn't use Google Maps anymore?
[00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:23.560]   Would you, would it be a problem, John?
[00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:25.760]   No, it wouldn't be a problem.
[00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:27.360]   You'd use map quests.
[00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:28.360]   You'd use map maps.
[00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:29.360]   Okay.
[00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:31.840]   In that case, John, let me ask you this.
[00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:37.600]   What does Google, at this point, with this getting out of China, with China was basically
[00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:43.000]   the only thorn in their side that people could point at and saying they're not doing that
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   right.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.960]   They're not following their Don't Be Evil motto.
[00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:50.560]   Everything else they're doing is either, you know, open source data liberation front.
[00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:55.280]   Everything they're doing is trying to be open and, and, and, you know, the way they should
[00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:57.680]   be doing things.
[00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:02.360]   Is there anything that you could tell Google, except, you know, the big spooky thing we don't
[00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:07.920]   trust Google because they have all our info, which I agree with, but what else could they
[00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:10.560]   be doing to earn your trust and love?
[00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:13.800]   You don't find they've got my trust and love.
[00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:14.800]   I don't like them.
[00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:18.040]   I don't do the doc stuff and I don't do, I use the Google search engine.
[00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:19.040]   It works great.
[00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:22.320]   But that means is there anything more they could do to impress me?
[00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:24.120]   You might want to ask that question.
[00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:25.120]   I don't know.
[00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:28.160]   I think the Nexus phone is kind of neat, except it's so slippery.
[00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:29.160]   Ah, it's not that slippery.
[00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:31.040]   I heard you talking about it being slippery.
[00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:32.400]   It's no more slippery than the iPhone.
[00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:33.400]   The iPhone was slippery.
[00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:34.640]   I dropped it a couple of times already.
[00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:37.040]   I have to, but the I dropped the iPhone the first day I got it.
[00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:39.360]   You just have to hold on tight.
[00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:43.160]   You can see that's the problem with the Nexus when you hold on tight and you touch the screen
[00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:46.360]   and because it doesn't have dual touch or whatever, it shorts it out and you can't do
[00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:47.360]   anything.
[00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:48.360]   It does, by the way.
[00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:49.560]   You have to hold it weird like this.
[00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:50.560]   No, no, no.
[00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:52.960]   The operating system doesn't have multi touch.
[00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:54.560]   The phone hardware has multi touch.
[00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:58.080]   Hey, I heard an interesting rumor and this was from a correspondent who does not wish
[00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:02.000]   to be named, who works at Google, who said, "I'll tell you what really happened."
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:07.240]   Apple, with whom Google still has a very good relationship, said, "Can you guys not put
[00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:08.880]   multi touch on the phone for a little while?
[00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:11.280]   Our patents for multi touch are very weak.
[00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:14.200]   We don't want them challenged at this point."
[00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:15.200]   I don't know why Google--
[00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:16.200]   That's a good story.
[00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:17.200]   It's a good story.
[00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:22.640]   I don't know why Google would exceed except that maybe they still like Apple.
[00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:26.680]   I can prove that as multi touch because you can use multi touch on the keyboard.
[00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:28.520]   There are applications that support multi touch.
[00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:32.280]   There's even a browser that supports multi touch that you can put on the Nexus One and
[00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:34.120]   the Droid, by the way, which also has multi touch.
[00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:35.840]   I love this phone, John.
[00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:40.600]   I have officially replaced my iPhone with the Nexus One.
[00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:42.200]   You've actually moved over.
[00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:43.680]   You dropped the iPhone for this thing?
[00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:46.520]   Yeah, and I love it.
[00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:48.760]   So why did they only sell 20,000?
[00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:56.680]   Well, I mean, because they don't have Apple's marketing clout.
[00:30:56.680 --> 00:31:01.120]   I think probably for most users, the iPhone probably still-- we debated this yesterday.
[00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:08.240]   Jeff Jarvis, who's not a hacker type, he's uncomfortable with the Google phone, but Gina
[00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:09.960]   and I loved it.
[00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:12.520]   I think it's for people who don't want to mess with their phone.
[00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:15.120]   The iPhone's very straightforward, very simple.
[00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:20.560]   But if you want to have folders on your desktop, you want to have any kind of configuration
[00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:25.680]   capabilities, if you want to have an open store, if you want to have multi-tasking, this phone,
[00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:26.680]   it's so fast.
[00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:27.680]   It's a gigahertz processor.
[00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:29.880]   I'm not saying I don't like the phone.
[00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:31.880]   I just don't like the fact that it's slippery.
[00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:33.800]   Hey, get a case.
[00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:36.760]   Well, when I get a case, I'll be a happy camper.
[00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:41.440]   I ordered a case right away out of the silicone case, but the iPhone's just as slippery.
[00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:42.720]   It really is.
[00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:48.880]   So the thing about it is that what I do like is that when you're doing SMS, you can just
[00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:51.160]   push the little microphone and then say some by that.
[00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:53.160]   Isn't that the coolest?
[00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:54.880]   And then you don't have to deal with typing.
[00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:55.880]   It works great.
[00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:56.880]   You're all doing it.
[00:31:56.880 --> 00:32:00.560]   And the other thing, and it's amazingly accurate, and the other thing I do like about I like
[00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:02.480]   the turn-by-turn, it's very good.
[00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:06.800]   Yeah, it's got built-in turn-by-turn GPS free.
[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:09.440]   That when you arrive, it gives you a free view.
[00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:11.240]   It shows you a picture where you're arriving.
[00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:15.200]   It uses the Google map that looks like the text of photos.
[00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:19.240]   The integration into Google is significant.
[00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:20.240]   I mean, it's huge.
[00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:23.880]   All right, I'm going to compose a text to you, John.
[00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:24.880]   Here we go.
[00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:29.320]   So instead of using the typing, I'm just going to speak into it.
[00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:33.400]   Hey, John, how are you today?
[00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:34.400]   Question mark.
[00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:35.560]   I am fine, period.
[00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:37.560]   Let's see if it's been that.
[00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:38.560]   All right.
[00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:39.560]   What are you laughing at?
[00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:41.560]   I'm sorry you came around.
[00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:42.560]   I'm sorry you came around.
[00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:44.760]   You could probably do it in French, actually.
[00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:48.200]   Hey, John, how-- oh, look, it did R U 2.
[00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:51.040]   It did it like in-- like I'm a kid, like texting.
[00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:53.040]   And I don't know why--
[00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:55.640]   At least it figured out your personality, Leo.
[00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:56.640]   Yeah.
[00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:59.120]   No, I've been using it for all week-- well, not all week.
[00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:01.240]   I got back from CES on Sunday.
[00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:07.200]   So yeah, I guess all week for-- and I started doing the texting in the last couple of days
[00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:08.200]   using the dictation.
[00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:09.200]   I love it.
[00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:12.240]   Now, it's not good for driving because you still-- you don't have to fiddle with it sometimes.
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:14.920]   But you don't do a little editing.
[00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:17.600]   But I just-- I think this phone is spectacular in so many ways.
[00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:19.520]   I just really happy with it.
[00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:22.080]   Great camera, great video.
[00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:28.160]   So will you still be happy with it when the fourth iPhone comes out?
[00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:29.160]   Talk to me then.
[00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:30.160]   What do you figure?
[00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:31.160]   No, Leo's fickle.
[00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:32.160]   No, talk to me then.
[00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:34.920]   Well, look, no, my job is not to be loyal.
[00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:37.840]   That's not my job to be loyal to a platform or a device.
[00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:38.840]   He's fickle.
[00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:41.120]   So whatever bandwagon is right, I'm fickle.
[00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:42.440]   I try it all.
[00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:49.440]   And if something-- I kept trying iPhone replacements that I did, the Palm Pre, the Storm, the Instinct,
[00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:50.440]   even the Droid.
[00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:52.360]   And I never replaced the iPhone until this came along.
[00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:53.360]   I'm not fickle.
[00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:54.880]   I go with the best.
[00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:58.920]   I don't have loyalty to a device because my job is to tell you what the best is.
[00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:00.400]   And I don't even think it's the best--
[00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:01.880]   No, I don't want to hear anymore.
[00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:05.320]   So I just laying it on there.
[00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:07.600]   That's not-- that's what it is.
[00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:09.240]   Isn't that your job?
[00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:13.680]   So I went back-- I still-- I like the Nexus phone, but here's another problem I have with
[00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:14.680]   it.
[00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:20.960]   So I did a kind of a stress test with it, and I cranked it way up.
[00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:24.180]   Somebody in the chat room just said, "Be careful, de Vark, he'll pull a mic airing to
[00:34:24.180 --> 00:34:25.180]   me on you."
[00:34:25.180 --> 00:34:28.520]   Screw you, de Vark!
[00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:35.160]   So by the way, that video still has 1/1000th the number of views of Barney singing in your
[00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:36.960]   bathtub.
[00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:37.960]   So here's the deal.
[00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:41.720]   Maybe I should be going to call you for weeks, the sparring thing.
[00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:44.320]   But anyway, I loaded it up.
[00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:45.600]   I put the Wi-Fi on.
[00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:47.240]   I put the GPS on.
[00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:49.680]   I loaded it up to the gills with everything.
[00:34:49.680 --> 00:34:56.080]   It lasted three and a half hours under full load, which I thought was kind of nice.
[00:34:56.080 --> 00:35:00.000]   But just under just average use, it still drops dead after a day.
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:06.120]   The old Nokia E71 and N71, which one it is, that my normal regular phone-- I think it
[00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:08.200]   goes on for a week without having to recharge it.
[00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:09.200]   I'm always forgetting to charge it.
[00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:10.680]   Give it up, John.
[00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:12.160]   No smart phone is going to do that.
[00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:16.480]   I mean, it's got an OLED screen, which is a little bit more economical, but it's not--
[00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:18.360]   No smart phone is going to go a week anymore.
[00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:20.440]   No phone is going to go a week anymore.
[00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:22.080]   That's just old school, man.
[00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:23.400]   You charge it every night.
[00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:25.400]   What's wrong with that?
[00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:26.400]   I forget.
[00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:27.400]   I forget.
[00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:31.360]   So here's John.
[00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:33.720]   What I do is, okay, I have a dresser.
[00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:38.520]   When I take off my clothes, I put my wallet and my keys on the dresser, and I plug in
[00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:39.520]   my phone.
[00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:42.720]   And then the next morning, it's all ready to go for me.
[00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:45.400]   What we need is wireless recharging.
[00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:46.400]   Like the--
[00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:47.400]   There is such a thing.
[00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:48.400]   There is such a thing.
[00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:50.240]   You can buy third party things.
[00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:51.240]   I don't--
[00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:52.720]   I'm grumpy, and I forget.
[00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:54.880]   I don't really have a problem with that.
[00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:59.080]   I kind of expect that any smart phone is going to have to be recharged.
[00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:00.240]   It's got to get through a day.
[00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:01.240]   That's kind of the minimum.
[00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:03.240]   And this is about--
[00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:06.640]   It's about the same as the pre and the iPhone.
[00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:08.720]   They're all kind of like that, depending on how you use it.
[00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:11.840]   When you know when you get a new phone, you turn on all the buttons.
[00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:13.480]   You do what the Vore acted.
[00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:17.760]   But under normal use, I find it's exactly a day.
[00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:21.520]   But again, I plug it in when I get to work.
[00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:22.760]   It's not an issue for me.
[00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:24.080]   And it has an interchangeable battery.
[00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:25.080]   You don't like that?
[00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:27.680]   Get a second battery.
[00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:29.400]   Well at least you can do that.
[00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:30.400]   Yeah.
[00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:31.400]   Yeah.
[00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:36.280]   I mean, I just-- I really think this is finally the Android operating system coming of age.
[00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:37.840]   I guess that's my point.
[00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:39.360]   With 2.1, it has come of age.
[00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:40.560]   I liked the Droid a lot.
[00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:42.360]   I thought it was this close.
[00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:44.400]   And Nexus 1 gets it right there.
[00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:46.640]   I was very impressed.
[00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:49.600]   And I think that I would like to see this do well.
[00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:55.000]   I mean, I do have some advocacy, a little bit of juice for it, because if this phone
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.120]   does well, there'll be more applications for it.
[00:36:57.120 --> 00:36:58.120]   It is an open--
[00:36:58.120 --> 00:36:59.120]   Oh, wait.
[00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:00.120]   I know what it is.
[00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:02.840]   This is a week in Nexus.
[00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:03.840]   No, no, no.
[00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:04.840]   We already do it this week.
[00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:05.840]   Another podcast.
[00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:07.480]   You're not doing enough.
[00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:09.640]   If I were going to do a podcast, I would do a cell phone podcast.
[00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:10.640]   You're right.
[00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:11.720]   I think that that's something that we could probably do.
[00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:13.760]   But you know, and you're absolutely right.
[00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:15.000]   I'm going to see what happens in March.
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   Hey, you know what?
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:20.960]   January 26, the week from Tuesday, if Apple announces something spectacular that it's
[00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:22.640]   better than this, then I'll replace this.
[00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:25.640]   I go with whatever is the best today.
[00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:26.640]   That's not sickle.
[00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:28.120]   It's a 6 or 27 in December.
[00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:29.760]   No one knows exactly.
[00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:30.760]   It's all rumor.
[00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:31.760]   Apple hasn't said anything.
[00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:33.640]   But we will be there whatever day it is.
[00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:41.480]   Well, I hope Google brings the Nexus phone in France so that we can tax it.
[00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:44.880]   Another opportunity for revenue.
[00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:46.760]   I don't think-- I don't think fickle's the right word.
[00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:47.760]   I try them all.
[00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:48.760]   I buy them all.
[00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:49.760]   I don't get free versions.
[00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:51.280]   I try them all.
[00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:53.240]   And if something's better, I tell you it's better.
[00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:54.240]   That's all.
[00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:55.520]   And if it's not, I set it aside.
[00:37:55.520 --> 00:37:59.480]   And I've been using the iPhone for three years, which is a measure of its success.
[00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:02.680]   And finally, I found something that is, I would say, as good as--
[00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:04.240]   Which depends on who you are.
[00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:07.360]   As I said, do you use an iPhone yet, John?
[00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:08.360]   No.
[00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:09.360]   You're still a Nokia guy.
[00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:10.360]   I use a Nokia.
[00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:11.560]   And then I also use the Nexus.
[00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:13.120]   And I have to decide.
[00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:18.000]   I would use an iPhone, but I hate AT&T to such an extreme that I refuse to.
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.760]   And I have principles.
[00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:21.760]   OK.
[00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:27.480]   This is what worries me about the rise of the Google phone.
[00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:32.560]   You can install an application from anywhere, which everyone has been saying, yes, this
[00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:33.640]   is the way we should do it.
[00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:34.920]   It's like, you know, a computer.
[00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:35.920]   You can do that.
[00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:37.960]   You don't need to go through the app store.
[00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:44.160]   And we don't need to-- we have how many tens of millions of zombie computers working
[00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:48.800]   for whatever ghost network, whoever thought that was a good idea.
[00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:52.160]   Who wants to replicate this on phones, on everyone?
[00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:53.160]   This is going to happen.
[00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:54.960]   You know it's going to happen if you know--
[00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:55.960]   Guess what?
[00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:56.960]   It's going to be happened.
[00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:59.040]   Well, there you go.
[00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:06.640]   The Android marketplace to be a developer for Android, you nearly need to sign up.
[00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:08.360]   And that's it.
[00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:10.320]   And there's no approval process unlike Apple.
[00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:11.800]   There's no approval process at all.
[00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:12.800]   It's open.
[00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:14.520]   And I think that that's a strength.
[00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:17.840]   However, it's also a security risk.
[00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:25.120]   A person with the handle Droid09 uploaded into the Android market and was there for a day
[00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:28.440]   or two, a program called First Tech Credit Union.
[00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:33.040]   If you were a customer of the First Tech Credit Union, you might have downloaded it
[00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:34.320]   saying, oh, great.
[00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:37.000]   My bank has put up an Android application.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:42.600]   According to a warning on the credit union site, the app was malware.
[00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:46.400]   We recently learned that a fraudster developed a rogue Android smartphone app.
[00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:50.920]   It creates a shell of mobile banking apps that tries to gain access to a customer's
[00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:53.400]   financial information.
[00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:57.480]   But the bank, please note this attack didn't target First Tech accounts accessing your account
[00:39:57.480 --> 00:39:58.680]   from your phone's browser.
[00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:00.000]   Still is completely secure.
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.480]   The app is down.
[00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:04.720]   But this is exactly what you're saying, Patrick.
[00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:07.720]   This is the risk of having an open marketplace.
[00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:13.520]   And this is bad enough, but you can also operate outside of the Android market, right?
[00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:17.720]   If you put a link on the website, you can go there through the phone and it's all the
[00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:18.720]   app.
[00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:19.720]   Yes.
[00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:22.920]   Now, to do that, you have to go in the settings in the phone and say, I am willing and it gives
[00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:24.880]   you a risk, a security warning, everything.
[00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:28.040]   I am willing to get applications from third parties.
[00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:31.400]   But that's ironic because it doesn't take much to put one on the marketplace.
[00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:36.520]   So it's obviously so yeah, you're given openness.
[00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:42.520]   I think probably I would expect and I would I think it needs to be that Google or somebody
[00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:47.160]   makes kind of a vetted marketplace where these are secure.
[00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:49.160]   But I like the choice and I think that's the key.
[00:40:49.160 --> 00:40:53.480]   You don't have a choice really unless you jailbreak the iPhone, which is not only an
[00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:59.240]   onerous process, it reduces its reliability and causes all sorts of other issues.
[00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:00.240]   That's true.
[00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:07.760]   But I think you do need a sort of label, approved, proven, safe, whatever reviewed for the apps
[00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:12.440]   so that you probably know that you can, you know, it may be even only let people download
[00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:17.680]   approved apps if they don't change that setting in the menu.
[00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:21.760]   Because if you don't, pretty much you're going to start needing an antivirus and a firewall
[00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:24.840]   on your phone and stuff like that, it's going to be horrible.
[00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:30.800]   There has been a lot of complaints about customer service.
[00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:36.560]   There are people who got the Google phone, the Nexus One and discovered the T-Mobile sucked.
[00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:41.360]   Shock, you know, which it does apparently in some areas.
[00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:42.360]   It works quite well here.
[00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:44.040]   I'm actually getting 3G reliably.
[00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:50.680]   I haven't dropped a single call, which I can't say is the case for the iPhone here.
[00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:58.440]   If you buy, I have to say, if you buy a T-Mobile version of the Nexus One, not only will you
[00:41:58.440 --> 00:42:04.040]   face potential early termination fees from T-Mobile, but Google has its own equipment
[00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:10.400]   recovery fee, $350 if you cancel within the first 120 days.
[00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:11.400]   It's not so good.
[00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:13.320]   Listen, can you back this up a minute?
[00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:14.600]   If you do, what would be the case?
[00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:19.160]   According to Engadget, okay, I'm going to read the story.
[00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:22.040]   Ross Miller posted it on Engadget January 12th.
[00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:25.440]   Here's another reason to consider going the unlocked route with the Nexus One, which is
[00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:29.080]   what I did, by the way, because I want to be able to take it to Europe and so forth.
[00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:35.040]   In addition to having the AT&T, non-3G, and international GSM option, as a number of people
[00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:40.440]   have noticed, Google has its own early termination fee equivalent here called the Equipment
[00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:42.600]   Recovery Fee.
[00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:45.240]   In the terms of sale, they say they will charge you.
[00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:47.040]   I don't know if they actually are doing it.
[00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:51.960]   $350 if you cancel within the first 120 days.
[00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:54.920]   This is in addition to any fees imposed by the carrier.
[00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:58.840]   What would anybody not just buy an unlocked phone then?
[00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:04.600]   Yeah, because T-Mobile's got its $200 ETF.
[00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:06.280]   Where is this coming from?
[00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:08.720]   Do other carriers do that as well?
[00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:15.400]   In the states, all carriers have an ETF, which is usually $175 or more.
[00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:17.560]   That is because they're subsidizing the phone.
[00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:19.920]   This is for people who buy the subsidized.
[00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:23.080]   By the way, once you terminate, you should be able to get an unlocked code for any phone
[00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:24.080]   you have.
[00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:28.440]   That's the law, but very rarely in practice.
[00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:31.840]   Well, nobody ever has to do it because they don't get the fact that the phone's locked
[00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:33.680]   in the first place.
[00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:35.680]   But I have the number of phones that I'm sorry.
[00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:41.160]   I've usually given it to the kids eventually, but that are past their due date and you just
[00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:42.840]   call them up and they give you the unlocked code.
[00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:46.040]   You unlock it the phone, but you can do anything with it after that.
[00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:47.040]   This one's unlocked.
[00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:49.480]   It was $529, but it's unlocked.
[00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:54.320]   Then you can get a month to month T-Mobile account so you don't even have an ETF from
[00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:55.840]   T-Mobile.
[00:43:55.840 --> 00:43:57.960]   I thought it was a good, that's attractive.
[00:43:57.960 --> 00:43:59.800]   That's kind of like how it is in Europe.
[00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:00.920]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:02.720]   That's exactly the way it is in Europe.
[00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:08.520]   You do have an ETF for the carrier, but you don't have an ETF from the manufacturer.
[00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:09.520]   That's unheard of.
[00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:11.440]   I've never heard of that before.
[00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:12.440]   That's just bizarre.
[00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:13.960]   I don't know if Google's enforcing it.
[00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:17.800]   Lots of complaints though on the boards about Google's lack of customer support.
[00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:21.800]   People who are having trouble with T-Mobile have no one to talk to.
[00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:24.320]   Apparently, you can't call anyone at Google.
[00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:26.600]   You have to send an email, right?
[00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:27.600]   They don't have phones.
[00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:29.200]   They don't use phones.
[00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:31.120]   You use Google Voice.
[00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:32.600]   Yeah.
[00:44:32.600 --> 00:44:33.600]   That's one thing I love about this.
[00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:37.480]   It's one of those things I do like from Google quite a bit.
[00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:41.560]   I wish they would open this up because this is one of the strongest selling points for
[00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:42.560]   the Nexus one.
[00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:45.000]   Maybe this is why they haven't sold that many.
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:48.280]   You still can't, you can get an invite maybe if somebody you know has Google Voice, but
[00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:50.920]   there's no other way that I know if to get a Google Voice account.
[00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:54.160]   I happen to have one because I was a grand central customer.
[00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:57.280]   This works with Google Voice to the point that you replace the voicemail with Google
[00:44:57.280 --> 00:44:58.280]   Voice.
[00:44:58.280 --> 00:45:00.600]   You can even replace all the calling with Google Voice if you want.
[00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:04.360]   I have it set so the international calls go through Google Voice which is a lot cheaper
[00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:05.360]   than T-Mobile.
[00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:07.680]   Then I don't use T-Mobile's voicemail.
[00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:11.760]   I use Google Voice so all the messages come to my phone just like visual voicemail plus
[00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:15.320]   text which is something Apple doesn't do.
[00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:16.880]   I think that's another selling point.
[00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:20.960]   Unfortunately, you have to have somebody email me and say, "Well, that's nice, but who has
[00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:21.960]   Google Voice?"
[00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:23.800]   Not everybody does, alas.
[00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:27.480]   I have people who ask around most people you can get it.
[00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:29.000]   There's invites all over the place.
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:34.000]   I bought a few on the Bay actually for like $3.50, $3.50.
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:36.000]   That's a good deal.
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:40.920]   I got an invite and got a US number and now there's talk of Google Voice maybe coming
[00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:46.600]   to Europe and I'm afraid I'm going to be stuck with my US number stuck to my account
[00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:48.600]   and I just opened it to test.
[00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:49.600]   No, no.
[00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:50.600]   They have a $10 fee.
[00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:52.440]   You can change it to anything you want.
[00:45:52.440 --> 00:45:54.000]   Thank you, John.
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:56.920]   You just saved my Google Voice life.
[00:45:56.920 --> 00:46:01.440]   When you use your Google Voice, is it as if you were calling from the US?
[00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:02.680]   I'm actually never using it.
[00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:09.720]   I did it twice to test it, but that's cool.
[00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:14.280]   I'm really hoping they bring it to Europe, but apparently it's not in the books for right
[00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:15.280]   now.
[00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:17.520]   They've been talking about it recently a little bit.
[00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:21.760]   That's definitely one of the things that would put the phone over the iPhone if it's
[00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:22.760]   like this.
[00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:23.760]   Oh, spectacular.
[00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:26.760]   Apparently, they're telling me the chatroom that somebody said, "Well, I just went to voice
[00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:28.640]   dot Google dot com requested an invitation.
[00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:29.640]   I got one within a week."
[00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:32.600]   So I guess they are a little bit more liberal with these now.
[00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:35.240]   Yeah, they just needed to get their capacity of.
[00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:36.240]   It's amazing product.
[00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:39.240]   I mean, we don't even have any long distance service anymore.
[00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:40.400]   We just use Google Voice.
[00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:42.360]   The whole family does.
[00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:46.320]   And because Google Voice is a long distance service of sorts, that's free.
[00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:47.320]   And there goes my AT&T.
[00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:49.320]   I don't have to deal with them anymore.
[00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:51.480]   The only negative I've noticed, have you noticed this?
[00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:53.520]   There's some lag in the phone calls.
[00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:55.080]   There's a lot of latency.
[00:46:55.080 --> 00:46:56.080]   Nope.
[00:46:56.080 --> 00:46:57.080]   Okay, maybe this is...
[00:46:57.080 --> 00:46:58.080]   I've never noticed that.
[00:46:58.080 --> 00:46:59.080]   It's like a half second.
[00:46:59.080 --> 00:47:00.080]   It's like a half second.
[00:47:00.080 --> 00:47:01.080]   Oh, no.
[00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:02.080]   Quality's good.
[00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:03.080]   Okay.
[00:47:03.080 --> 00:47:04.080]   This is what I'm talking about.
[00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:09.600]   What other company has improved our lives as much as it seems like I'm in love with Google,
[00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:12.080]   which admittedly I'm a little bit.
[00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:17.600]   But they have really changed our lives a lot more than most companies in the past, you
[00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:20.320]   know, five, maybe even to 10 years.
[00:47:20.320 --> 00:47:21.600]   Oh, I'd say so.
[00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:27.680]   In fact, you could make a case in the States that both AT&T and Verizon recently this week
[00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:34.160]   announced a drop in the costs of their all-in-one programs, you know, all-you-can-eat programs.
[00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:39.800]   And I think that you can trace it directly to the fact that T-Mobile introduced this plan,
[00:47:39.800 --> 00:47:45.840]   you know, this all-you-can-eat plan, very inexpensive plans that are month to month.
[00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:48.960]   And I think that you can say that they did that because they knew they were getting the
[00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:52.240]   Google phone, and this is basically a plan for the Google phone.
[00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:56.880]   So in a way, you can indirectly say that Google is absolutely making a strong impact
[00:47:56.880 --> 00:48:00.160]   on the wireless industry in the US.
[00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:02.760]   Prices are going down because of them.
[00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:03.760]   Good.
[00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:11.200]   Article and mobile beat about the chip in the Nexus 1, it's the Audience A1026 Voice Processor
[00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:12.200]   chip.
[00:48:12.200 --> 00:48:17.560]   This is an additional chip that apparently makes a huge difference in the quality.
[00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:24.320]   The DSP and the quality of the phone calls, the real-time processing brings up the human
[00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:31.400]   voice, brings down the background noise, brings down digital echoes.
[00:48:31.400 --> 00:48:33.600]   So they actually built in a voice processing chip in this.
[00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:36.360]   It's got a microphone in the back of the phone.
[00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:38.160]   Yeah, it's got two microphones.
[00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:43.800]   Yeah, that's basically like a noise reduction system that works like it does for these high-end
[00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:45.800]   headphones, right?
[00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:46.800]   Right.
[00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:51.040]   There's a phone hole there, and I don't know if that's a microphone.
[00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:52.040]   That's the speaker.
[00:48:52.040 --> 00:48:53.760]   This is the speaker here, and then there's a microphone on the bottom.
[00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:56.600]   So I guess this is picking up background noise.
[00:48:56.600 --> 00:48:59.280]   That's a clever design.
[00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:02.600]   I haven't noticed the sound quality one way or the other because I very rarely make phone
[00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:04.800]   calls.
[00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:11.280]   For me, I do much more texting and emailing and all that than I do phone calls.
[00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:14.760]   Let's see, other stories we're going to get to in just a bit.
[00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:16.440]   There is quite a bit of news.
[00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:21.640]   In fact, I'd love to get a kind of CES from the outside point of view from Patrick and
[00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:23.040]   John.
[00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:25.480]   Before we do that, I want to mention our friends at carbonite.com.
[00:49:25.480 --> 00:49:31.600]   It's a backup solution, a great backup solution that I've been using since the bad, dim,
[00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:34.480]   dark day about three years ago.
[00:49:34.480 --> 00:49:39.880]   When I lost 10 Gizwiz shows by accidental deletion and had to call Dick D. Bartolo and
[00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:45.440]   say, "You know those great shows we just recorded, can we do those again?"
[00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:48.440]   And then right about the same time, it was the same mistake I made.
[00:49:48.440 --> 00:49:56.320]   I installed, I turned on Windows Media Player and it said, "Do you want to look for songs
[00:49:56.320 --> 00:49:57.480]   on the hard drive?"
[00:49:57.480 --> 00:49:59.400]   I said, "Yes."
[00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:00.400]   It cataloged them all.
[00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:04.240]   Then I thought it was like iTunes where if I deleted the names of the songs, it wouldn't
[00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:07.600]   delete the songs except that it did.
[00:50:07.600 --> 00:50:13.880]   So not only did I lose 10 Gizwiz's, but I also lost, it happened twice.
[00:50:13.880 --> 00:50:19.400]   In an interview for Floss Weekly, I lost it once.
[00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:20.400]   I called the guy back.
[00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:21.400]   We did it again.
[00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:23.400]   I lost it again.
[00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:25.080]   I had to send him a fruit basket.
[00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:26.960]   I felt so bad and we did it a third time.
[00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:30.240]   I'm not going to say names, but it was after that that I said, "Look, I got to have a
[00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:33.840]   solution so that I don't lose podcasts anymore."
[00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:35.920]   And I discovered carbonite.com.
[00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:37.080]   I've been using it ever since.
[00:50:37.080 --> 00:50:38.080]   So what happens?
[00:50:38.080 --> 00:50:39.320]   You can go there right now and install it.
[00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:42.880]   You go to carbonite, C-A-R-B-O-N-I-T-E.com.
[00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:43.880]   You don't need a credit card.
[00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:45.920]   Just use the coupon code TWIT.
[00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:46.920]   And you can install it.
[00:50:46.920 --> 00:50:49.320]   You'll be able to try it free for 15 days.
[00:50:49.320 --> 00:50:51.600]   Immediately, it starts backing up your data.
[00:50:51.600 --> 00:50:53.760]   Use AES-256-bit encryption.
[00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:56.760]   You choose the key so no one can get into it.
[00:50:56.760 --> 00:51:02.520]   Scrambles it up, then uses 128-SSL for extra security to upload it to their servers.
[00:51:02.520 --> 00:51:04.200]   Now, it's using your bandwidth.
[00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:07.800]   So depending on how much data you have, how fast your connection is, how much you're using
[00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:10.480]   the computer, it could take a little while to get that data up there.
[00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:15.960]   Once it's up there, it's automatically backing up all those precious documents.
[00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:19.880]   Your personal files, your email, your photos.
[00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:21.840]   You don't have to worry, by the way, about size.
[00:51:21.840 --> 00:51:23.600]   I back up gigabytes.
[00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:27.360]   As long as it's on the internal hard drive on your computer, you have unlimited backup
[00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:29.360]   and it's less than $5 a month.
[00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:30.920]   That's a great deal.
[00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:32.840]   I want you to try carbonite free right now.
[00:51:32.840 --> 00:51:35.880]   Go to C-A-R-B-O-N-I-T-E.com.
[00:51:35.880 --> 00:51:38.040]   This is great for a laptop.
[00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:40.040]   C-A-R-B-O-N-I-T-E.com.
[00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:43.600]   You see, offer code Leo, you'll get two weeks to try it for free.
[00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:45.120]   Mac and Windows, by the way.
[00:51:45.120 --> 00:51:49.320]   And after you try, and I do, I really want you to try it first.
[00:51:49.320 --> 00:51:51.960]   Make sure it's something that fits your needs.
[00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:54.960]   If you decide to buy, we're going to give you two months free with the offer code to
[00:51:54.960 --> 00:51:55.960]   it.
[00:51:55.960 --> 00:51:59.560]   So use that offer code TWIT and give carbonite a try.
[00:51:59.560 --> 00:52:00.960]   It's a great backup solution.
[00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:02.800]   It's not enough to backup locally.
[00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:04.680]   You got a backup offsite.
[00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:07.640]   And if you're backing up offsite, do it right with carbonite.
[00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:14.880]   We'll thank them for their support of our network, our entire network.
[00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:16.920]   So by the way, just one more Nexus One story.
[00:52:16.920 --> 00:52:21.120]   Did you see that Wozniak was doing an interview on NBC?
[00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:24.240]   And he said, when they asked him, "What's your favorite gadget?"
[00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:26.440]   He said, "Oh, I like the Google phone."
[00:52:26.440 --> 00:52:27.440]   See Wozniak?
[00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:28.440]   He did?
[00:52:28.440 --> 00:52:29.440]   Yeah.
[00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:30.440]   He said, "It's the latest one."
[00:52:30.440 --> 00:52:31.440]   And it's a non-apple product.
[00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:32.440]   It just came out yesterday.
[00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:34.400]   I love Woz because he's just like, "You know what?
[00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:35.400]   He's guile-less."
[00:52:35.400 --> 00:52:36.400]   He's fickle.
[00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:38.400]   He's not fickle.
[00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:41.200]   He just says it like he sees it.
[00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:45.040]   And by the way, later he said, "But I still have two iPhones."
[00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:47.680]   Because he got a little bit of, "I'm sure heat."
[00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:51.920]   I'm sure Steve said, "Woz, dude."
[00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:54.880]   He says, "We need up at the cottage, by the way, when I'm showing you."
[00:52:54.880 --> 00:52:55.880]   What's that?
[00:52:55.880 --> 00:52:57.040]   In case of this.
[00:52:57.040 --> 00:53:02.120]   Is that a Bordeaux Chateau Lynch bagel?
[00:53:02.120 --> 00:53:03.200]   Lunch bags.
[00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:04.520]   Lunch bags.
[00:53:04.520 --> 00:53:05.720]   Is that a good Bordeaux?
[00:53:05.720 --> 00:53:06.720]   Oh, yeah.
[00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:07.720]   Oh, yeah.
[00:53:07.720 --> 00:53:12.120]   Well, don't drink it.
[00:53:12.120 --> 00:53:16.000]   Whatever you do, keep a kark in it, Dvorak, because I want to try.
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:17.800]   You keep telling me how great Bordeaux are.
[00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:20.360]   And I don't know if I've ever had a great Bordeaux.
[00:53:20.360 --> 00:53:21.880]   Patrick, you've had a couple of them.
[00:53:21.880 --> 00:53:23.360]   All those Laoville wines are great Bordeaux.
[00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:24.360]   The Laovilles are good?
[00:53:24.360 --> 00:53:25.360]   Okay.
[00:53:25.360 --> 00:53:26.360]   Okay.
[00:53:26.360 --> 00:53:27.360]   They were very good.
[00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:28.360]   And they're your wine.
[00:53:28.360 --> 00:53:29.800]   I mean, they've got your name on them.
[00:53:29.800 --> 00:53:30.800]   I know.
[00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:32.520]   I should drink more Laoville.
[00:53:32.520 --> 00:53:34.360]   It's the name of my blog.
[00:53:34.360 --> 00:53:35.800]   Patrick, do you drink Bordeaux?
[00:53:35.800 --> 00:53:37.520]   Do you drink wine at all?
[00:53:37.520 --> 00:53:40.680]   I'm the worst French person you will ever find.
[00:53:40.680 --> 00:53:41.680]   I don't drink wine.
[00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:44.200]   Well, I drink, you know, like everyone else.
[00:53:44.200 --> 00:53:45.200]   But...
[00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:46.200]   You hate baguettes, too?
[00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:48.200]   I hate the baguettes.
[00:53:48.200 --> 00:53:49.200]   Come on.
[00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:50.200]   I hate baguettes.
[00:53:50.200 --> 00:53:51.960]   I mean, that's unavoidable.
[00:53:51.960 --> 00:53:52.960]   I hate the baguette.
[00:53:52.960 --> 00:53:54.920]   It is disgusting bread.
[00:53:54.920 --> 00:53:56.400]   No, you love it.
[00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:57.960]   But yeah, who could not love a baguette?
[00:53:57.960 --> 00:53:58.960]   Yes.
[00:53:58.960 --> 00:54:02.080]   When it's just warm, it comes out of the oven in the morning when you go get it at the
[00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:08.280]   bakery, that little chevra show, and you're set.
[00:54:08.280 --> 00:54:09.280]   That's it.
[00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:10.280]   I'm ready.
[00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:13.120]   By the way, Meatloaf and Bordeaux go together great.
[00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:14.120]   Do they?
[00:54:14.120 --> 00:54:15.120]   Somebody asked.
[00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:18.760]   We did a Meatloaf, our Munchcast show was about Meatloaf right before Twit.
[00:54:18.760 --> 00:54:23.240]   So what other news items do we have here?
[00:54:23.240 --> 00:54:25.440]   Well, there was this thing in Haiti.
[00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:26.440]   Did you see...
[00:54:26.440 --> 00:54:28.560]   Now Twitter went crazy with the Haiti thing.
[00:54:28.560 --> 00:54:32.040]   In fact, it's funny because two days before Twitter, Ev Williams announced the Twitter
[00:54:32.040 --> 00:54:34.680]   had had its busiest day ever.
[00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:35.680]   Just for no apparent reason.
[00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:39.680]   There was no big news story or anything, just growth.
[00:54:39.680 --> 00:54:42.040]   And then...
[00:54:42.040 --> 00:54:43.680]   And he said, "And tomorrow will be even bigger."
[00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:46.840]   And then the earthquake happens and of course, Twitter goes crazy.
[00:54:46.840 --> 00:54:48.960]   There's emergency messages on Twitter.
[00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:52.680]   I don't think there's a lot of Twittering coming out of Haiti, maybe some of the NGOs.
[00:54:52.680 --> 00:54:53.680]   But what...
[00:54:53.680 --> 00:54:54.680]   There's a couple.
[00:54:54.680 --> 00:54:55.680]   Some of it.
[00:54:55.680 --> 00:55:00.280]   And then what I thought was great was the immediate retweeting of text, the word Haiti
[00:55:00.280 --> 00:55:05.160]   to 90999 and donate 10 bucks to the American Red Cross.
[00:55:05.160 --> 00:55:08.320]   There was some misinformation that also got Twitter'd like the phone companies are going
[00:55:08.320 --> 00:55:09.320]   to take a lot.
[00:55:09.320 --> 00:55:12.000]   None of the cellular companies were taking any cut out of that.
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:14.000]   It all went straight to where the Red Cross.
[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:16.200]   But where at the beginning?
[00:55:16.200 --> 00:55:17.520]   Were they charging for...
[00:55:17.520 --> 00:55:21.080]   Well, they were just taking the charge for the message.
[00:55:21.080 --> 00:55:22.080]   Oh, alright.
[00:55:22.080 --> 00:55:24.600]   Which some people said was cynical.
[00:55:24.600 --> 00:55:29.120]   And then I think there was a comment on BOL this week.
[00:55:29.120 --> 00:55:34.600]   One said, "Well, when you check to a bank takes a few organizations."
[00:55:34.600 --> 00:55:40.680]   No, but the post office is not going to write off the price of the standpoint.
[00:55:40.680 --> 00:55:41.680]   That's a good point.
[00:55:41.680 --> 00:55:46.520]   In any case, I think that they wised up and they're not taking any fee for that.
[00:55:46.520 --> 00:55:47.520]   And here's the great thing.
[00:55:47.520 --> 00:55:50.560]   So this is not the first time the Red Cross did this.
[00:55:50.560 --> 00:55:51.560]   In what was it?
[00:55:51.560 --> 00:55:52.560]   When was Katrina?
[00:55:52.560 --> 00:55:53.560]   2004, 2005.
[00:55:53.560 --> 00:55:57.040]   They did it and raised $200,000.
[00:55:57.040 --> 00:56:03.280]   After the Asian tsunami, they did it again, raised $400,000 to date.
[00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:09.440]   In four or five days since the terrible earthquake in Haiti, $11 million.
[00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:11.880]   $1 to 11 now?
[00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:14.160]   11 was six, like two days.
[00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:16.640]   $11 million as of this morning.
[00:56:16.640 --> 00:56:17.760]   And it's interesting.
[00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:21.880]   Well, I think it says something, first of all, that people are texting more, right?
[00:56:21.880 --> 00:56:23.120]   More people are comfortable with that.
[00:56:23.120 --> 00:56:24.720]   I think Twitter has a lot to do with it.
[00:56:24.720 --> 00:56:29.280]   I have to think that the words spread on Twitter.
[00:56:29.280 --> 00:56:30.520]   And I did it.
[00:56:30.520 --> 00:56:31.920]   You know, I immediately did it.
[00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:35.560]   It's just so easy to do.
[00:56:35.560 --> 00:56:38.000]   So I think that that's kind of encouraging.
[00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:39.640]   That was a good gimmick.
[00:56:39.640 --> 00:56:41.640]   That's quite amazing.
[00:56:41.640 --> 00:56:47.080]   So the other amazing thing is that Twitter didn't go down at all.
[00:56:47.080 --> 00:56:48.080]   No.
[00:56:48.080 --> 00:56:50.000]   Yeah, something's going on there.
[00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:52.400]   Yeah, that's more amazing than anything.
[00:56:52.400 --> 00:56:54.840]   We haven't had a Twitter is down story in a while.
[00:56:54.840 --> 00:56:57.680]   I think Twitter might be maybe they've solved this.
[00:56:57.680 --> 00:57:00.520]   Maybe they're reliable.
[00:57:00.520 --> 00:57:01.520]   Could it be?
[00:57:01.520 --> 00:57:05.240]   Could it possibly be?
[00:57:05.240 --> 00:57:11.960]   Microsoft says this can't be right, that it's legal to rent windows.
[00:57:11.960 --> 00:57:14.760]   Yeah, this is a big story that broke last week.
[00:57:14.760 --> 00:57:21.240]   Yeah, they're going to start in USKU, the rental SKU that comes out of nowhere.
[00:57:21.240 --> 00:57:22.240]   It's weird.
[00:57:22.240 --> 00:57:23.240]   Would they even?
[00:57:23.240 --> 00:57:26.520]   Well, first of all, I don't even understand renting.
[00:57:26.520 --> 00:57:28.080]   It's like rent.
[00:57:28.080 --> 00:57:31.720]   Do you remember the olden days when they used to have vinyl albums and night nowadays with
[00:57:31.720 --> 00:57:32.720]   a DVD store?
[00:57:32.720 --> 00:57:36.160]   You go in and you rent the DVD.
[00:57:36.160 --> 00:57:43.280]   Oh, like, but what you rent, what, what, like, okay, I'm going to go to the software
[00:57:43.280 --> 00:57:46.120]   store and rent Microsoft Word for the night.
[00:57:46.120 --> 00:57:47.120]   Yeah.
[00:57:47.120 --> 00:57:48.120]   What do we mean?
[00:57:48.120 --> 00:57:49.120]   Yeah.
[00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:50.600]   Make sure you drop, bring it back after a couple of days.
[00:57:50.600 --> 00:57:52.160]   Don't forget to rewind.
[00:57:52.160 --> 00:57:55.080]   Who's going to rent Microsoft Word for a night?
[00:57:55.080 --> 00:57:57.080]   I get to rewind the disc.
[00:57:57.080 --> 00:57:58.080]   Oh, yeah.
[00:57:58.080 --> 00:58:00.160]   I borrowed Windows 7 for the weekend.
[00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:01.600]   May we had a great time.
[00:58:01.600 --> 00:58:03.120]   No, you know what it's going to be?
[00:58:03.120 --> 00:58:07.560]   It's going to be for companies that have projects that are going to take like a couple
[00:58:07.560 --> 00:58:12.360]   of months that they need to set up an office or, you know, a department for and they need
[00:58:12.360 --> 00:58:15.480]   to rent the thing for a couple of months.
[00:58:15.480 --> 00:58:21.240]   And then they, I don't know, give it up or the serial number deactivates or you can't
[00:58:21.240 --> 00:58:23.800]   use it in two locations at the same time.
[00:58:23.800 --> 00:58:25.520]   Actually, this doesn't make sense.
[00:58:25.520 --> 00:58:26.520]   I'm sorry.
[00:58:26.520 --> 00:58:28.120]   It makes no sense at all.
[00:58:28.120 --> 00:58:29.080]   But it's a nice try.
[00:58:29.080 --> 00:58:33.320]   I have to think that what this really is is Microsoft's always kind of wanted to charge
[00:58:33.320 --> 00:58:34.840]   a monthly fee.
[00:58:34.840 --> 00:58:36.400]   That's what it's really all about.
[00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:37.400]   Right.
[00:58:37.400 --> 00:58:39.360]   They don't want to sell you software.
[00:58:39.360 --> 00:58:43.720]   They want you to really think of your software as a subscription.
[00:58:43.720 --> 00:58:47.280]   And is this kind of, John, you think this is a way of getting that through?
[00:58:47.280 --> 00:58:50.480]   Well, yeah, you know, they may hit by, I think that's part of it.
[00:58:50.480 --> 00:58:55.560]   I think they want to get people into a different frame of mind and then turn it into the whatever
[00:58:55.560 --> 00:58:58.480]   the software is a femoral software as a service.
[00:58:58.480 --> 00:58:59.480]   Right.
[00:58:59.480 --> 00:59:01.120]   I think it's a huge blunder, by the way.
[00:59:01.120 --> 00:59:05.200]   You know, if Microsoft had its act together, every time something like this China attack
[00:59:05.200 --> 00:59:09.840]   on Google came around, Microsoft could make hay by saying, hey, if you were using shrink
[00:59:09.840 --> 00:59:12.560]   rap, you wouldn't have a problem like this.
[00:59:12.560 --> 00:59:19.000]   I don't think Microsoft wants to point attention out to its security issues, especially since
[00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:22.880]   I think one of the major exploits was Internet Explorer.
[00:59:22.880 --> 00:59:23.880]   Yeah.
[00:59:23.880 --> 00:59:28.040]   This is how they cracked into all of these computers was through Aurora, the well known
[00:59:28.040 --> 00:59:31.040]   Microsoft flaw in Internet Explorer.
[00:59:31.040 --> 00:59:32.280]   And then another one in Adobe.
[00:59:32.280 --> 00:59:34.080]   Also present in seven and eight.
[00:59:34.080 --> 00:59:35.920]   It's not just a six thing, right?
[00:59:35.920 --> 00:59:36.920]   Yeah.
[00:59:36.920 --> 00:59:37.920]   Oh, you know, IE seven and eight.
[00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:38.920]   Yeah.
[00:59:38.920 --> 00:59:39.920]   Oh, yeah.
[00:59:39.920 --> 00:59:40.920]   It's in all of them.
[00:59:40.920 --> 00:59:41.920]   Hey, John, what happened?
[00:59:41.920 --> 00:59:42.920]   Your picture went away.
[00:59:42.920 --> 00:59:44.560]   Are you it got people were complaining that it's got too dark and I think it's because
[00:59:44.560 --> 00:59:47.880]   of a setting I did and I'm trying to go back and and unset it.
[00:59:47.880 --> 00:59:50.120]   It's like the lights went out in your room.
[00:59:50.120 --> 00:59:53.400]   I thought I thought it was just that the sun went down and it was going to go.
[00:59:53.400 --> 00:59:54.400]   I'm going right.
[00:59:54.400 --> 00:59:55.400]   Can't see.
[00:59:55.400 --> 00:59:56.400]   That's it.
[00:59:56.400 --> 00:59:57.400]   It's not turned out.
[00:59:57.400 --> 01:00:00.120]   I'm not getting anywhere with this with this trick of mind to fix it.
[01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:03.760]   No, let me let me call you back because once you once you do what you did, I don't think
[01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:05.000]   you can restart the video.
[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.000]   I don't know.
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:07.000]   Okay.
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:08.400]   Give me one second to get to the tools.
[01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:10.160]   Put some clothes on then turn on the lights.
[01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:11.160]   Okay.
[01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:12.160]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:13.160]   Here he comes.
[01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:14.160]   He's coming back.
[01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:16.160]   Yeah, but I didn't get to go under the fix.
[01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:20.040]   Yeah, you're still in the, well, just, you know, you could turn on a light.
[01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:22.120]   It's just, it's, look, watch.
[01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:24.480]   I'm going to turn a light, a really bright light on right now.
[01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:25.480]   Ready?
[01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:26.480]   Yeah.
[01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:27.480]   It's nothing.
[01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:35.240]   Just so people understand it looks like the warm glow of a fireplace across the room.
[01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:38.560]   I can leave this bright light on, I guess, but you know, I know what, what the setting
[01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:39.560]   is.
[01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:40.560]   I know what I did wrong.
[01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:41.560]   All right.
[01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:42.560]   Well, go ahead.
[01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:43.680]   I'll tell you what, we could take a break.
[01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:47.400]   You can go get a baguette and a glass of wine, Patrick.
[01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:48.960]   John can fiddle with his settings.
[01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:51.480]   And I go base my meat.
[01:00:51.480 --> 01:00:53.440]   Are you making dinner tonight, John?
[01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:54.960]   No, I'm just going to eat.
[01:00:54.960 --> 01:00:59.040]   I'm going to, no, we did a, we just did a podcast about meatloaf, as I mentioned, and
[01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:01.080]   I am famished.
[01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:02.440]   I just, it got my mouth.
[01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:03.960]   Do they meet love in France?
[01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:04.960]   Probably not.
[01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:05.960]   They probably turned their nose up.
[01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:06.960]   It's called a terrain.
[01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:07.960]   Oh, terrain.
[01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:08.960]   It's like pate.
[01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:09.960]   Yeah.
[01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:10.960]   Kind of a little bit.
[01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:13.760]   I have a subway meatballs though.
[01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:14.760]   That's delicious.
[01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:15.760]   Do not eat.
[01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:16.760]   That is so sad.
[01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:18.400]   I am so bummed out.
[01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:21.600]   Do you have quiz nose?
[01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:22.600]   Is there a quiz?
[01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:23.840]   Is there a quiz nose in France?
[01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:24.840]   I don't think so.
[01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:26.000]   No, I don't know that one.
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.240]   At least there's hope yet.
[01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:29.240]   Wendy's Taco Bell.
[01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:30.960]   Oh, no, not in France.
[01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:33.880]   I know McDonald's everywhere, but it's so funny because the McDonald's, I went to have
[01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:40.040]   a big, a big Mac and your secret sauce is different.
[01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:41.040]   No, that's it.
[01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:42.040]   It can be.
[01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:45.760]   It's very, the taste of a French Big Mac is nothing like it.
[01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:47.160]   I had one in Beijing.
[01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:49.560]   It's exactly like an American Big Mac.
[01:01:49.560 --> 01:01:50.560]   Exactly.
[01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:51.560]   In fact, you know what?
[01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:54.080]   The big fast food in China is Kentucky Fried Chicken.
[01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:56.080]   They love their KFC.
[01:01:56.080 --> 01:01:57.080]   Can't see.
[01:01:57.080 --> 01:01:58.080]   We have those.
[01:01:58.080 --> 01:01:59.080]   Yeah.
[01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:05.400]   The big thing in France and McDonald's is the Royal de Lüx, which is especially done
[01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:06.400]   for French.
[01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:07.400]   We don't even have that.
[01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:08.400]   Tastes.
[01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:13.720]   They have more and they'll go fit for Louis Cattars.
[01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:14.720]   The Royal de Lüx.
[01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:15.880]   There, that looks good, John.
[01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:16.880]   That's a big.
[01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:19.720]   I got the bright light on me because I, yeah, it's fine.
[01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:22.920]   But it's better than the old bright light.
[01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:25.760]   He's dancing.
[01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:29.240]   Is it disco, disco, de vorac?
[01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:32.560]   I want to be a disco de vorac.
[01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:35.720]   New version of the cray of the tech grout is on the line, by the way.
[01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:38.640]   Somebody should check it out, techgrudge.mvio.com.
[01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:41.640]   What is that clown up to now?
[01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:43.200]   He is just so grouchy.
[01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:47.360]   Hey, I had a question about the rental-esque AU.
[01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:48.360]   Yes.
[01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:51.440]   I'm sorry, maybe we're on to something else.
[01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:54.560]   No, you're bringing us right back to where we ought to be.
[01:02:54.560 --> 01:02:56.280]   I thought that was John's job.
[01:02:56.280 --> 01:02:57.280]   Yeah, no.
[01:02:57.280 --> 01:03:00.720]   John's, he's turned into the distractor in chief.
[01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:05.680]   No, I just wanted to know if any of you got, either of you guys knew how much it was.
[01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:06.680]   I was going to be playing it.
[01:03:06.680 --> 01:03:07.680]   I'm sorry, hold on, hold on.
[01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:10.320]   Mvio seems to have snuck into our feed.
[01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:12.560]   Right, it's super tough against us.
[01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:13.560]   Damn it.
[01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:14.560]   Stop.
[01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:16.000]   How do I stop that?
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:17.000]   There's no stop button.
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:20.200]   You can turn it off.
[01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:21.200]   There you go.
[01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:23.920]   There's the tech grout.
[01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:24.920]   Brought to you by Crest.
[01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:25.920]   Now that's weird.
[01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:26.920]   Wait a minute.
[01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:31.880]   Does the toothpaste company know they're sponsoring a guy with no teeth?
[01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:32.880]   It's not.
[01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:34.720]   The guy has no teeth.
[01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:39.000]   So it's been reported that some teacher back in Arizona has hooked his computers from the
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:42.600]   school district up to look for aliens.
[01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:47.240]   Now they're claiming it cost the school district a million bucks for him to do this.
[01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:48.240]   They fired him.
[01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:50.160]   But who built for the million?
[01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:51.160]   The aliens?
[01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:52.840]   Hey, wait a minute.
[01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:55.320]   What is that hanging in his beard?
[01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:56.480]   That is not.
[01:03:56.480 --> 01:03:57.480]   That's the mic.
[01:03:57.480 --> 01:03:58.480]   That is not.
[01:03:58.480 --> 01:03:59.480]   You're a mic a guy.
[01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:00.480]   It is not appetizing.
[01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:04.880]   It looks like there's a chunk of food in your booty.
[01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:08.760]   The still is going to blow up if you keep the heat that high.
[01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:12.400]   John, John, don't put the mic in the beard.
[01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:16.040]   You put the mic on the shirt, not in the beard.
[01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:18.880]   Just a little technical tip.
[01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:19.880]   Get off the set.
[01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:20.880]   Truth be told.
[01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:24.240]   I was listening to that trans music on the iPhone.
[01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:25.240]   Wow.
[01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:27.040]   I had a trip.
[01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:29.480]   Got any suggestions for the show?
[01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:41.400]   Find a self-addressed stamp beaver to check garage at me.com.
[01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:43.280]   See that sound?
[01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:46.680]   That's the microphone in your beard.
[01:04:46.680 --> 01:04:51.160]   I brought to you by crest.
[01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:52.720]   How does that's pretty amazing.
[01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:55.920]   Meevio gets like proctor and gambled a bit to do ads.
[01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:56.920]   That's pretty good thing.
[01:04:56.920 --> 01:04:57.920]   Oh, it's really good.
[01:04:57.920 --> 01:04:59.920]   I'm thrilled to have Ford.
[01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:00.920]   Hello.
[01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:01.920]   Happy for you.
[01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:04.200]   We don't have Ford anymore either.
[01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:09.960]   I don't know if there's anything to do with this, but we had a Ford guy in the show last
[01:05:09.960 --> 01:05:12.240]   week at CES.
[01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:15.600]   I wanted him to be on Twitter, but I probably should have been more clear that if you're
[01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:19.680]   on Twitter, you can't talk about Ford, you have to be like a geek.
[01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:21.280]   It just ended up being a big ad.
[01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:24.800]   The chat room was going crazy saying, "This is a program like that."
[01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:29.800]   So I said, "All right."
[01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:34.800]   I let him go and we cut it out.
[01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:37.800]   Ever since we don't have any Ford ads.
[01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:38.800]   I'm sorry.
[01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:40.800]   No, I think it was the schedule ran out.
[01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:42.800]   I do have an Audible ad.
[01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:43.800]   They love us.
[01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:45.800]   They love us Audible.com/Twit2.
[01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:46.800]   Your chance to get two.
[01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:48.800]   Not one, but two.
[01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:50.800]   Free books from Audible.com.
[01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:52.800]   I listen to Audible books all the time.
[01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:56.040]   You do need two books for that one because it's divided up into two parts.
[01:05:56.040 --> 01:05:57.040]   It's so long.
[01:05:57.040 --> 01:06:04.680]   If you go to Audible.com/Twit2 right now, browse around, take a look at all the fantastic
[01:06:04.680 --> 01:06:07.360]   books on Audible.com.

[01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:16.920]   They record a lot of older books that have never been released as audio, especially some
[01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:20.160]   sci-fi, which is fantastic.
[01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:23.960]   They love that just it was never classics that were just never recorded.
[01:06:23.960 --> 01:06:29.320]   You can pick two of them, any two, and make them yours.
[01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:31.560]   For free, go to Audible.com/Twit2.

[01:06:33.960 --> 01:06:35.120]   They download in just a minute or two.
[01:06:35.120 --> 01:06:36.120]   That's another nice thing.
[01:06:36.120 --> 01:06:41.320]   You get a hankering for a book or maybe you're going on a trip soon and you're ready to,
[01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:46.280]   you know, "Oh boy, I can't get in that plane without something to listen to."
[01:06:46.280 --> 01:06:50.120]   Within a minute or two, you can load up your iPod, your iPhone, your Zoom.
[01:06:50.120 --> 01:06:53.120]   Your Kindle, your Sansa Eye River.
[01:06:53.120 --> 01:06:57.000]   They have a whole device center where you can look and see what devices they support.
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:02.680]   Pretty much everything except for the, sorry to say, except for my Android phone, but that's
[01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:03.880]   coming soon, I'm told.
[01:07:03.880 --> 01:07:06.720]   The Audible folks said this year.
[01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:13.240]   One of the books I just downloaded, thanks to Tom Merritt Damon and Freedom.
[01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:25.120]   Daniel Suarez' books, Tom says they're really great.
[01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:28.520]   That solves a murder.
[01:07:28.520 --> 01:07:30.480]   Pretty wild stuff.
[01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:31.480]   Great choices here.
[01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:32.480]   Audible.com/Twit2.
[01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:33.480]   Give them a try.
[01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:36.400]   You're going to love it and we thank them so much for their support of our show.
[01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:37.640]   You know who loves Audible?
[01:07:37.640 --> 01:07:38.640]   Who loves others?
[01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:39.640]   Mothers.
[01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:40.640]   Really?
[01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:41.640]   Mothers love Audible.
[01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:45.520]   My mom and I part a few years ago and then I got her another book account.
[01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:49.200]   It's the kind of thing that mothers say, "I don't need it.
[01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:50.200]   I don't really get it.
[01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:51.200]   I don't know what it's for.
[01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:52.200]   I don't need it.
[01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:53.440]   I'm fine."
[01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:57.160]   And then a couple of months after that, they come back to you and go like, "I can't live
[01:07:57.160 --> 01:07:58.160]   without it."
[01:07:58.160 --> 01:07:59.160]   Yeah.
[01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:00.160]   Yeah.
[01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:02.040]   My mom loves audiobooks.
[01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:03.040]   She really does.
[01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:05.000]   That's actually a very good idea.
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:06.240]   I get mom a couple of things.
[01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:09.640]   In Netflix account, she loves that audio books.
[01:08:09.640 --> 01:08:13.040]   And I got her on internet radio and she's loving that.
[01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:17.760]   So you know Rob Blasier, probably pretty well, John C. Devorek, former CEO, founder of Real
[01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:18.760]   Networks.
[01:08:18.760 --> 01:08:22.680]   And also the guy who bought the Professional Bowling Association.
[01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:23.680]   Did he really?
[01:08:23.680 --> 01:08:24.680]   Yep.
[01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:25.680]   You're kidding?
[01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:26.680]   Lost knocking barrel.
[01:08:26.680 --> 01:08:28.000]   He made his money at Microsoft, right?
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:29.960]   He was a Microsoft guy for a long time.
[01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:30.960]   Yeah, he was.
[01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:35.640]   But I think he really made most of his money with real networks because I think they got
[01:08:35.640 --> 01:08:37.480]   a lot of money.
[01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:42.080]   In 2000, well, he was been at Real for 16 years, created the Real Player, which was kind of
[01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:44.280]   the bane of the internet everybody.
[01:08:44.280 --> 01:08:48.440]   Some say the most hated program on the internet.
[01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:49.600]   I would be in that camera.
[01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:50.600]   I would agree too.
[01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:52.480]   It would have to be close to that, right?
[01:08:52.480 --> 01:08:55.560]   Because it's just downloaded so much crap on your computer.
[01:08:55.560 --> 01:08:57.680]   It wasn't a great audio format.
[01:08:57.680 --> 01:08:59.840]   I'm so glad we've gotten away from it and gone to MP3.
[01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:05.600]   And every once in a while I'll browse to an old website, like old-time radio or audio
[01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:06.600]   air checks.
[01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:08.920]   And the guys did everything in real audio.
[01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:10.840]   And it's like, "Oh, please.
[01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:12.840]   No, no, please."
[01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:18.600]   Well, luckily if you have that video land program, it'll play the real audio stuff and
[01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:19.840]   then it'll also convert it.
[01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:22.360]   It just sounds so bad though.
[01:09:22.360 --> 01:09:23.360]   So bad.
[01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:24.840]   I remember Bonzi, Bonzi, buddy.
[01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:26.000]   Yeah, it was just terrible.
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:31.400]   But it was, you know, to be fair from an earlier era where people didn't have the bandwidth.
[01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:36.240]   And it needed something that could stream audio in very low quality bandwidth and video
[01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:37.240]   too.
[01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:38.240]   In 2005--
[01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:39.720]   That's true, but it wasn't the problem, right?
[01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:40.720]   Sorry.
[01:09:40.720 --> 01:09:41.720]   Well, the problem was what?
[01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:44.320]   That it was a lot of crapola that you got when you got the real player.
[01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:48.160]   Yeah, the program when you downloaded it and installed it, you pretty much said goodbye
[01:09:48.160 --> 01:09:51.960]   to half your hard drive and computer CPU cycle.
[01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:52.960]   Right.
[01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:56.960]   And it really was started to go downhill for real when MP3s became popular.
[01:09:56.960 --> 01:10:01.240]   And then in 2006 when YouTube emerged, that's it.
[01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:05.000]   And put the nail in the coffin.
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:13.720]   Fortunately, real had sued Microsoft.
[01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:21.160]   And for a billion dollars, they settled when Microsoft agreed to pay real $761 million
[01:10:21.160 --> 01:10:28.600]   in cash and services and promote Rhapsody on the MSN network, real owns Rhapsody.
[01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:31.640]   So that kind of set real up for life.
[01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:34.840]   I mean, that's it.
[01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:39.360]   Real gotten kind of trouble last year when they released something called Real DVD, which
[01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:43.080]   I thought was a really great second act for real.
[01:10:43.080 --> 01:10:45.960]   It was DVD copying software.
[01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:48.080]   But it had some stuff to protect the studios.
[01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:49.480]   Like you couldn't copy a movie.
[01:10:49.480 --> 01:10:51.280]   You had to keep the copy.
[01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:52.280]   You could only make one copy.
[01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:55.680]   It was kind of the thing you would have thought the studios would have said, "Yeah."
[01:10:55.680 --> 01:10:58.000]   And I'm sure that's what Rob thought they sued.
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:03.960]   It was the example of fair use, respecting fair use in the software.
[01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:09.520]   And of course, the movie industry has no, you know, no leeway for this.
[01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:11.000]   So Rob has resigned.
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.440]   We don't know why he's leaving.
[01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:17.840]   I think we got his bowling average up.
[01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:19.320]   Does he still own the PBA?
[01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:21.840]   Yeah, as far as I know he does.
[01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:23.640]   Wow, that's interesting.
[01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:26.800]   Him and a few partners, they got together.
[01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:28.040]   He bought it for next to nothing.
[01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:29.040]   Well, sure.
[01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:30.400]   How much could the PBA be worth?
[01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:35.320]   Well, you know, one point in the sometime ago, in the 50s, the era when Grant's Tomb
[01:11:35.320 --> 01:11:37.520]   was the number one tourist attraction.
[01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:38.520]   Yeah.
[01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:40.960]   The PBA bowling was the most popular sport on television.
[01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:42.160]   I don't see you as a bowler.
[01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:44.720]   I see you as a candle pin kind of guy.
[01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:46.520]   You know, I've done candle pins.
[01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:48.920]   Man, that is one hard game.
[01:11:48.920 --> 01:11:50.360]   Yeah, that's the challenging.
[01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:52.880]   That's the bowling for people who really are serious.
[01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:53.880]   Oh.
[01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:56.480]   Those little candle pins, they are hard knocked down.
[01:11:56.480 --> 01:11:59.160]   If you get the strike ever, it's a miracle.
[01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:00.160]   Yeah.
[01:12:00.160 --> 01:12:05.160]   The best one, by the way, if you want to play these crazy rolling a ball game.
[01:12:05.160 --> 01:12:06.160]   Yeah.
[01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:07.920]   Rubber band ducks.
[01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:08.920]   I never heard of it.
[01:12:08.920 --> 01:12:09.920]   Where do they play that?
[01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:10.920]   Is that Wisconsin?
[01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:13.280]   They played it back east in some a couple, I think in Massachusetts you can find some
[01:12:13.280 --> 01:12:14.280]   rubber band.
[01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:15.280]   Rubber band ducks.
[01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:16.280]   Yeah.
[01:12:16.280 --> 01:12:20.400]   Yeah, they call rubber band ducks or duck pins, but they got a rubber band around the middle,
[01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:21.400]   big, thick thing.
[01:12:21.400 --> 01:12:24.560]   So they bounce all over like crazy.
[01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:26.200]   And it's actually kind of a fun game.
[01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:31.360]   And then there's a game up in Canada called Five Pin Bowling, which is actually quite difficult.
[01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:33.840]   And of course, then there's a regular duck pins.
[01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:35.120]   I think there's a couple other ones.
[01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:38.120]   And most people who are ever bowlers, they've always trying to go out of their way to play
[01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:41.120]   these other crazy games.
[01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:45.720]   Duck pins are shorter and squatter than the regular pins used in 10 pin bowling, according
[01:12:45.720 --> 01:12:46.720]   to Wikipedia.
[01:12:46.720 --> 01:12:48.520]   Oh, they are.
[01:12:48.520 --> 01:12:50.000]   They're little.
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:51.000]   And then you have a little ball.
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:52.000]   Yeah, but they have a little rubber band ducks.
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.520]   You got, I don't know if they mentioned them in there, but rubber band ducks is very
[01:12:54.520 --> 01:12:55.520]   obscure.
[01:12:55.520 --> 01:12:56.880]   There's only a few places left that have them.
[01:12:56.880 --> 01:12:57.880]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:57.880 --> 01:12:58.880]   Here it is.
[01:12:58.880 --> 01:13:03.080]   Rubber band duck pins introduced in the Baltimore or I'm sorry, Balmer Washington area.
[01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:07.960]   The pins are circled with hard rubber bands to increase action and scoring.
[01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:11.760]   Rubber band duck pin is the only version of duck pin played in the province of Quebec.
[01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:13.440]   Ah, right.
[01:13:13.440 --> 01:13:15.160]   There you go.
[01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:16.760]   That's where I played it.
[01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:17.760]   Quebec.
[01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:20.120]   I'm securities for everybody.
[01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:24.200]   It's not France, but it sounds like it.
[01:13:24.200 --> 01:13:27.360]   Um, I think we've, we covered all the stories.
[01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:29.720]   Can't be, you know, the Google's so dominated.
[01:13:29.720 --> 01:13:32.760]   I don't think Apple's Kodak suing Apple.
[01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:35.240]   Oh, this is, you know, Apple suing Nokia.
[01:13:35.240 --> 01:13:36.240]   Nokia suing Apple.
[01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:40.680]   In fact, the latest is that Apple is suing Nokia to keep them from shipping any products
[01:13:40.680 --> 01:13:42.600]   in the US at all.
[01:13:42.600 --> 01:13:45.680]   Yeah, the good luck with that at all.
[01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:48.480]   It's like, no, sorry.
[01:13:48.480 --> 01:13:50.320]   You're no longer allowed.
[01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:58.760]   Now Kodak sues Apple and rim saying the technologies that you use to display images on your digital
[01:13:58.760 --> 01:14:04.920]   cameras and computers violates our patent.
[01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:08.320]   That's well, wait a minute though.
[01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:09.320]   Wait a minute.
[01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:10.320]   Wait a minute.
[01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:12.160]   Listen, who's paying royalties?
[01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:14.200]   Yeah, that's what I was going to say.
[01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:15.200]   Yeah.
[01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:19.680]   LG Motorola, Nokia, Samsung and Sony Eric's and all pay Kodak royalties.
[01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:21.760]   And, and for, for what?
[01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:29.680]   For technology, for reviewing different images of different resolutions and another as ridiculous.
[01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:34.920]   I mean, okay, the patent thing is completely out of control.
[01:14:34.920 --> 01:14:36.960]   Although, I don't know, maybe there is some.
[01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:37.960]   It is.
[01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:38.960]   It is.
[01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:39.960]   It's, it's, it's, this is a US issue though, isn't it?
[01:14:39.960 --> 01:14:42.560]   I mean, you don't have these problems in France.
[01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:43.560]   It doesn't feel like it.
[01:14:43.560 --> 01:14:44.560]   No.
[01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:45.560]   No.
[01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:46.560]   We sue at the drop of the hat.
[01:14:46.560 --> 01:14:50.960]   The imaging company really essentially invented the digital camera and a lot of other stuff.
[01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:51.960]   Ah.
[01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:54.560]   So, tons of patents.
[01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:56.360]   Ah.
[01:14:56.360 --> 01:15:00.560]   I just love how in America, if you, if you, you know, you have trouble competing, well,
[01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:01.560]   just sue them.
[01:15:01.560 --> 01:15:02.560]   You can just.
[01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:03.560]   It works.
[01:15:03.560 --> 01:15:06.080]   It's the second choice, you know.
[01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:12.800]   The origin of it is the patents that are being awarded so, you know, with no basis, right?
[01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:13.800]   Right.
[01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:19.480]   This is, this goes back to that Google phone story about Apple asking Google, please don't
[01:15:19.480 --> 01:15:20.480]   put multi-touch in.
[01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:24.160]   We don't want to have to defend this patent because the multi-touch patent that Apple
[01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:25.160]   has is absurd.
[01:15:25.160 --> 01:15:30.240]   I mean, there's, there's, you know, people have been looking at multi-touch for years,
[01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:34.240]   long before Apple even considered it.
[01:15:34.240 --> 01:15:35.240]   Yep.
[01:15:35.240 --> 01:15:38.600]   Errolines are rolling out Wi-Fi.
[01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:44.680]   I used Wi-Fi on Virgin America when we flew to Vegas and back.
[01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:46.320]   Very slow, not all that usable.
[01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:47.320]   Certainly not.
[01:15:47.320 --> 01:15:49.320]   You could use Skype, but you could check your email.
[01:15:49.320 --> 01:15:53.560]   Normally, it'd be about 1295, but in this case, Google paid for it.
[01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:57.400]   And I have to say, the first thing you see is an ad for the Nexus One phone before you
[01:15:57.400 --> 01:15:58.600]   get to use your Wi-Fi.
[01:15:58.600 --> 01:16:00.240]   It's pretty smart.
[01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:04.080]   Company that does this is GoGo, which is a product of AirCell.
[01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:07.200]   AirCell is the leading internet airline provider.
[01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:09.640]   American Airlines started it.
[01:16:09.640 --> 01:16:14.640]   GoGo will be offered soon on American Delta Air-Trans Virgin America already.
[01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:18.800]   United Air Canada, US Airways, Continental.
[01:16:18.800 --> 01:16:23.000]   Southwest Airlines is working with another provider, Rho44, to put Wi-Fi.
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:26.000]   So basically, you're not going to be able to get on an airplane and say, "I'm out of
[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:27.000]   touch."
[01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:31.840]   Yeah, they're going to let you use the laptop with all these new TSA regulations.
[01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:33.920]   Have they backed down a little bit on that, I hope?
[01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:34.920]   Yeah.
[01:16:34.920 --> 01:16:39.560]   It's not going to take much to get a background.
[01:16:39.560 --> 01:16:43.360]   So Continental is experimenting with...
[01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:47.560]   They have a live in flight television system, which is something...
[01:16:47.560 --> 01:16:51.680]   It's been around for a while on JetBlue.
[01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:57.920]   And then also on the same planes, they're going to put GoGo, the Wi-Fi.
[01:16:57.920 --> 01:16:59.040]   How does it work?
[01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:01.320]   Does it have satellite relay or...?
[01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:02.320]   That's a good question.
[01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:03.320]   I don't know.
[01:17:03.320 --> 01:17:05.720]   They go through a satellite relay, yes.
[01:17:05.720 --> 01:17:06.720]   They shoot up.
[01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:07.720]   Okay.
[01:17:07.720 --> 01:17:11.960]   Yeah, you'd have to, because otherwise they hand off from ground to ground at 600 miles
[01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:14.000]   an hour, it'd be crazy.
[01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.360]   So they're going up, not down.
[01:17:16.360 --> 01:17:17.360]   But they'll tell you, satellite...
[01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:18.360]   Absolutely.
[01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:19.360]   That's terribly slow, awful.
[01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:20.560]   Yeah, they're a big light.
[01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:22.320]   See, it's a bit miserable.
[01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:23.320]   Yeah.
[01:17:23.320 --> 01:17:28.120]   I used it on a flight from Los Angeles to San Francisco.
[01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:29.120]   It worked.
[01:17:29.120 --> 01:17:30.120]   Okay.
[01:17:30.120 --> 01:17:35.000]   I didn't expect it to be ADSL quality, but it allows you to do email.
[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.360]   I even sent a video, an iPhone video.
[01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:38.360]   Really?
[01:17:38.360 --> 01:17:39.360]   That's cool.
[01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:40.600]   You know, I got a Skype call from...
[01:17:40.600 --> 01:17:45.760]   I'm sorry, I got a Skype call from someone from the Louvtansa flight that was all online
[01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:46.760]   in the plane.
[01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:47.760]   Louvtansa had...
[01:17:47.760 --> 01:17:49.600]   Yeah, Louvtansa had faster internet.
[01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:52.680]   I used it on an SAS flight.
[01:17:52.680 --> 01:17:55.720]   Some years ago, it was very fast.
[01:17:55.720 --> 01:17:59.280]   So maybe yours was slow because Google was offering it free.
[01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:00.680]   Everyone was using it.
[01:18:00.680 --> 01:18:01.680]   I think...
[01:18:01.680 --> 01:18:02.680]   Well, of course it was.
[01:18:02.680 --> 01:18:03.680]   Especially from CES.
[01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:07.480]   Yeah, this is a plane trip to CES from San Francisco.
[01:18:07.480 --> 01:18:12.160]   Every single seat, they're opening up a laptop getting online.
[01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:13.160]   What am I thinking?
[01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:14.320]   Of course it was slow.
[01:18:14.320 --> 01:18:17.080]   Surprised it worked at all.
[01:18:17.080 --> 01:18:19.080]   So Gawker, I love Gawker's balls.
[01:18:19.080 --> 01:18:20.080]   These guys...
[01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:21.680]   Oh, that was beautiful.
[01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:23.560]   These guys, so they...
[01:18:23.560 --> 01:18:29.080]   Valley WAG, which is their Silicon Valley gossip site, offered $100,000.
[01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:36.960]   It was a scavenger hunt to anybody who provides an Apple tablet to the Gawker's and lets them
[01:18:36.960 --> 01:18:39.160]   play with it for an hour.
[01:18:39.160 --> 01:18:44.280]   $50,000 for a picture of Steve Jobs holding an Apple tablet.
[01:18:44.280 --> 01:18:50.960]   But ironically, the best proof they got was from Apple's legal team, which sent them a
[01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:57.920]   cease and desist email saying, "You should not solicit for photos, videos, or a sample
[01:18:57.920 --> 01:19:02.120]   of an unannounced and highly confidential Apple product."
[01:19:02.120 --> 01:19:06.280]   In effect, confirming the existence of the tablet.
[01:19:06.280 --> 01:19:09.320]   You know, I think Apple really made a huge mistake here and I'll tell you why.
[01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:13.760]   I don't understand why Apple didn't give them a picture and then have a picture of Steve
[01:19:13.760 --> 01:19:18.240]   and then collect $150,000 and put it in the coffers.
[01:19:18.240 --> 01:19:19.400]   What's wrong with that?
[01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:20.400]   You know, they...
[01:19:20.400 --> 01:19:21.400]   So they...
[01:19:21.400 --> 01:19:22.400]   So they...
[01:19:22.400 --> 01:19:23.400]   So they...
[01:19:23.400 --> 01:19:26.760]   They kind of gave the lawyers at Apple a second prize of sending them a DVD of legally
[01:19:26.760 --> 01:19:32.240]   blonde to a $25 Zoom marketplace gift card and a fabulous set of steak knives.
[01:19:32.240 --> 01:19:35.080]   I love it.
[01:19:35.080 --> 01:19:37.080]   Nick knows how to work it.
[01:19:37.080 --> 01:19:38.920]   You got to say that for him.
[01:19:38.920 --> 01:19:40.960]   Yeah, you got a lot of PR for that.
[01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:41.960]   Oh, it's great.
[01:19:41.960 --> 01:19:45.960]   Now, can they get in trouble for soliciting that?
[01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:46.960]   I don't think so.
[01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:47.960]   I think that's...
[01:19:47.960 --> 01:19:49.880]   I think that's a gray area.
[01:19:49.880 --> 01:19:50.880]   I think it's sketchy.
[01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:51.880]   I think it's just a...
[01:19:51.880 --> 01:19:56.640]   It's bad journalistic practice, but I don't think it's illegal to say, "I'll give you $100,000
[01:19:56.640 --> 01:19:59.040]   to break your NDA."
[01:19:59.040 --> 01:20:00.040]   Is it?
[01:20:00.040 --> 01:20:01.040]   I don't...
[01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:03.440]   Well, you know, I think NDA should be illegal.
[01:20:03.440 --> 01:20:04.440]   Why are you...
[01:20:04.440 --> 01:20:09.000]   How does anybody sign away their constitutional rights with a contract?
[01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:10.000]   Right.
[01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:11.000]   I mean, if you...
[01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:17.280]   If an NDA is legal, why can't I just go to Africa and find some, let's say, black people
[01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:20.560]   and have them sign away their constitutional rights in a contract?
[01:20:20.560 --> 01:20:21.560]   Come work for me.
[01:20:21.560 --> 01:20:22.560]   And they're slaves.
[01:20:22.560 --> 01:20:23.800]   Yeah, come work for me.
[01:20:23.800 --> 01:20:25.600]   I won't pay you.
[01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:29.680]   If you sign the deal, it's in the shrink wrap.
[01:20:29.680 --> 01:20:32.280]   I mean, when is this going to end?
[01:20:32.280 --> 01:20:34.080]   It's bogus.
[01:20:34.080 --> 01:20:37.640]   McDonald's is now offering free Wi-Fi in its restaurants.
[01:20:37.640 --> 01:20:40.240]   They did this before, but I guess it's back.
[01:20:40.240 --> 01:20:41.240]   So now with your...
[01:20:41.240 --> 01:20:42.240]   In France forever.
[01:20:42.240 --> 01:20:43.240]   Now with your...
[01:20:43.240 --> 01:20:44.240]   What is it?
[01:20:44.240 --> 01:20:45.240]   Your grande Royale?
[01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:46.240]   The...
