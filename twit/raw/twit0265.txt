[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.080]   to show the covers of the latest tech news.
[00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.560]   And this time we're doing a special edition.
[00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.720]   It's a very special this weekend tech.
[00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.160]   Because joining me are like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.560]   and perhaps six later on in the show
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.640]   of the original Tuit host.
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.000]   The only one missing at this point is Kevin Rose.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.480]   I'll start from my left, Mr. Roger Chang.
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:59.160]   Hello.
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.480]   Who is still a very welcome part of the family.
[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.120]   He does Eastmates West with Tom Merritt every Sunday,
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.920]   right after Tuit.
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.400]   Are you going to do it after this show?
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.000]   Yes.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.560]   Tom will stop by.
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:10.640]   I hope so.
[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.520]   I think everybody on this show worked at Tech TV, too.
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.840]   Yes.
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.360]   And now you all work at Revision 3.
[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.000]   Except for you.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.640]   And John.
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:19.480]   And John.
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.480]   John, do you do it, show it the Revision 3?
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.480]   What did you contract with?
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.840]   OK.
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:23.360]   Seem someone.
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.920]   And Robert.
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.000]   Seem someone.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.600]   Future is murky.
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.640]   That other voice we're hearing, of course, the great,
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.320]   the inimitable Mr. Patrick Norton from the screen savers
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.120]   in techzilla.com.
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.280]   Good to see you, Patrick.
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.640]   Good to be here.
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.080]   This all started because I sent out an email by accident
[00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.440]   that was a response to an email from Twit 14.
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.280]   And you all answered.
[00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.960]   This would have been what, five years ago?
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.080]   Yeah, it was like five years ago.
[00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.480]   Wait a minute.
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.760]   It was a 2005 email.
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:49.280]   Yep.
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.800]   I hear a voice in my ear.
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.240]   Is Yoshi, are you there?
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.880]   I am.
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:53.840]   I just figured.
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.160]   Just pull the wheel, actually.
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.360]   Oh my god.
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.440]   OMG.
[00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.000]   Oh my god.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.800]   Ladies and gentlemen, Yoshi di Herrera.
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:03.760]   Hey, guys.
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.080]   The famous Yoshi who dropped off the face of the earth
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.200]   after about Twit 14.
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.520]   I think it was right around then.
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.360]   We're so glad to hear from you, Yoshi.
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.040]   Let me introduce everybody else that I want to talk to you,
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.080]   because I know you're on a short break.
[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.400]   Actually, I pulled off from the side of my I-75.
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.520]   So I got a little time.
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.000]   Nothing to do until somebody rear-ends you.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.600]   Yeah.
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.760]   So great to hear from you, Yoshi.
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.880]   All the sandwiches that could happen at any time.
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:28.520]   No, really.
[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:29.720]   You don't want to mess around with that.
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.040]   That's John C. Devorek from Channel Devorek.
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.640]   And I think the only one of you who continues
[00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.480]   on a regular basis to be part of Twit.
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.400]   But all of you have appeared on Twit since then,
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.280]   except for Yoshi, I think.
[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.280]   So it's really great to see you, John.
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.840]   Good to be here, Leo.
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.520]   I have to do all sorts of weird switching
[00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:49.480]   to get everybody in here.
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.040]   That's my god, Robert Herring of HD Nation.
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.440]   Haven't seen Robert in ages.
[00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:55.960]   Good to see you again.
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:56.600]   Thank you.
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:57.280]   Good to be here.
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.000]   And let me place press one more button and--
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.480]   Bring in David Prager.
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:03.720]   It looks like he's at work.
[00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.520]   What are you doing at work?
[00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.480]   Oh, I was having some computer issues.
[00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.840]   So I decided I'd just go and use grabbing a computer.
[00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:11.680]   It's great to see you.
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.880]   And I happened to look at about a block and a half from here.
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.440]   So welcome back to all of you.
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:18.320]   It's so great to see you.
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.080]   Everybody should now check in on Facebook Places.
[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:24.960]   There'll be this massive, interconnected tissue.
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.640]   So David, I think that you said the reason Kevin couldn't make it
[00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.640]   is he's meeting with a new CEO of Dig.
[00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:30.760]   He finally has somebody--
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.080]   I'm pretty sure that's what he's doing.
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.400]   That's what he-- I think that's what he told me
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.520]   he was doing today.
[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.120]   Or a good part of the day to day.
[00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.960]   This is why--
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.320]   I think he's already started.
[00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.760]   This is why Twitter's bad, because I
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.480]   know for a fact he's watching football.
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:43.840]   Is that what he said?
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.200]   He's been tweeting out?
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.440]   Yeah.
[00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.120]   He's watching football.
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.360]   Yeah, maybe he's watching it with a new CEO of Dig.
[00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.800]   Yeah.
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.280]   I know he's really happy.
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.000]   So Yoshi just to have a CEO, because I
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.680]   know that it was a burden for him to run that thing.
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.520]   Yoshi, what have you been doing since we saw you last?
[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.360]   Well, actually, when I was at Twitter,
[00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.560]   I just started the last Twitter that I was on.
[00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.360]   I think I just started working for the company I
[00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.800]   want doing the visual effects work in the scanning.
[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.080]   And you got married and you had a baby?
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.600]   Yeah.
[00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.000]   All at once.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.240]   Still married.
[00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.400]   And Cruz is actually-- he's getting
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.200]   big certain kindergarten on Monday.
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.520]   Your kid is-- so Cruz is 6 now?
[00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:25.040]   He's 5.
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.360]   He's 35 in October.
[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.920]   Holy cow.
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:28.920]   He's a big, big, big.
[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:30.960]   So no, I never big-grudged it, because I knew
[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.560]   that you had quite a few things going on.
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.880]   So is it OK to say what movie you're working on right now?
[00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.880]   Yeah, well, right now, actually, I'm driving back to Atlanta.
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.160]   But Atlanta and we're doing a little work on fashion
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:43.560]   the Furious 5.
[00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:44.200]   That's exciting.
[00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.240]   Everybody's all ex-Toni Wang was jumping up and down when he
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.480]   heard that there's going to be a fifth.
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.240]   So was Patrick.
[00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:54.840]   So Yoshi, what do you do in the special effects biz?
[00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:59.120]   Well, basically what we do is we come in and they have a scan
[00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:05.720]   or 3D digitized sets, actors, cars, props, maquettes.
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.880]   Pretty much anything they want made 3D.
[00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:09.640]   Because when you were at the screen savers,
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.920]   you did a lot with that laser cutter.
[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:15.760]   And you did a lot of, of course, mod work.
[00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.920]   So this kind of segue into what you're doing now?
[00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:19.520]   Oh, definitely.
[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:23.800]   I mean, I've had to make our own little tools to get things done.
[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.080]   And that's helped a lot.
[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:27.040]   Sounds like a great job for you.
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:27.840]   That's a blast.
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:28.320]   It's a blast.
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.080]   We get to go from project to project.
[00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:34.320]   And I think I'm up to about 70 movies so far.
[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:36.280]   Holy cow.
[00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:37.760]   That's fantastic.
[00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:38.680]   Yeah, it's a lot of fun.
[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:40.760]   And I see pictures of you on my Facebook.
[00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:41.600]   You're looking good.
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.560]   You're obviously doing well.
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:48.560]   Yeah, I've pumped back up a little bit, unfortunately.
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:49.320]   So have I used it.
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.560]   It's not too good for the old exercise level.
[00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.720]   Unfortunately, the standard day is about 12 hours.
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:56.880]   And the craft table is no help either.
[00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:58.920]   No craft services does not help.
[00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:02.120]   I mean, it does the catering on set.
[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.720]   Oh, look, Oreos.
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.960]   Oh, some of the catering is amazing.
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:09.280]   One of them had a nice little lamb shoulder
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:11.120]   and a duck fat conchie.
[00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:12.120]   Out of this world.
[00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:14.360]   But it's probably not too good for me.
[00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:15.440]   Oh, man.
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:22.160]   So any fun stories from your Hollywood time?
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:24.160]   It's hard to say with so many little stories.
[00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:27.120]   I mean, I guess the biggest thing I would say
[00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:30.400]   that I've discovered is most of the people we work with
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:33.520]   are pretty cool and kind of like regular people.
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.840]   Do you get to drive the cars at all in fast experience?
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:37.240]   That would be fun.
[00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:38.600]   That would be fun.
[00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:40.760]   I could move them across the warehouse when I got a scan
[00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:43.800]   of them, but that's about it.
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:46.520]   Well, if you saw the video of me crashing the Ford Flex
[00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:48.840]   into the Ford Fiesta, you know that you never
[00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:51.000]   want to let me get behind the wheel at all.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.760]   So Yoshi, we're so pleased to know
[00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:55.080]   you're alive and well and thriving.
[00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:56.200]   And it's great to hear from you.
[00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:58.600]   If you want to stick around, we'd love to have you stick around.
[00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:01.480]   But I'm just pleased that you could call in and say hi
[00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:01.840]   to everybody.
[00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:04.440]   And I know everybody in the chat, I'm going crazy.
[00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:06.560]   I'm just so pleased to see you in here.
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:07.120]   Oh, yeah, definitely.
[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:08.120]   Let's stick around for a little bit.
[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:08.960]   Fantastic.
[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:10.600]   Pulled off, sitting in a gas station.
[00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:11.200]   I'm all good.
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:14.200]   By the side of the road, Yoshi's by the side of the road.
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:15.520]   It's a good thing you're not on Skype
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:18.640]   because I pretty much run out of room here.
[00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:21.680]   I have to manually switch to pull up people.
[00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:25.120]   So John, I will defer to you.
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:28.560]   But story number one, GoDaddy goes on the auction block,
[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:30.200]   according to the Wall Street Journal on Friday.
[00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:33.680]   GoDaddy, not my favorite domain name
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:34.720]   register on the world.
[00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:37.920]   Apparently, according to the Wall Street Journal makes about--
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:40.240]   what was it they said?
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:41.080]   $700 million.
[00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:42.640]   $700 million?
[00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:44.760]   A year.
[00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:45.760]   $700 million.
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:47.600]   How do you make $700 million to you?
[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:48.600]   You're making nine--
[00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:49.800]   Lots of $700 million.
[00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:50.800]   $995.
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:52.600]   You're having your view.
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:55.280]   Do you remember the dark days of network solutions
[00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:58.120]   and getting charged the bazillion dollars every year
[00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:59.080]   for your URL?
[00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.160]   GoDaddy comes in.
[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:00.880]   They take advantage.
[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:01.480]   I guess it's all--
[00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:03.040]   I'm president at low prices.
[00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:03.840]   Even $10.
[00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:04.800]   Well, don't they have to pay?
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.120]   I can or somebody, something.
[00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:10.120]   Nonetheless, they have a ton of customers, including me.
[00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:11.800]   Yeah, I was a GoDaddy customer.
[00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:14.320]   But I hated the--
[00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:15.320]   it wasn't so much the ads.
[00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:16.240]   It was the cheesy come on.
[00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:19.000]   You want to see the rest boys go to the website.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.240]   I've never actually seen one of the television advertising.
[00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:23.880]   But Danica, they are an advertiser on--
[00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:25.200]   We love GoDaddy.
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:28.000]   You use the text to go Daddy code.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:28.760]   What is the code?
[00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:29.600]   What is the code?
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:30.360]   Tech4.
[00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:31.960]   Revision3.com/GoDaddy.
[00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:33.160]   Of course, Prager.
[00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:34.360]   You know, it's interesting.
[00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.280]   I actually met one of the guys.
[00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:40.200]   They support Cranky Geeks as well.
[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:41.400]   They're good people, right?
[00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:42.960]   John C. Devorak?
[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:47.800]   Yeah, use the code Crank, C-R-A-N-K.
[00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:49.080]   This episode of--
[00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:50.480]   "Not Project You In Any Way."
[00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:53.480]   --in this discussion is brought to you by Leo LaPourne,
[00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:54.480]   standing alone.
[00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:56.080]   Yeah.
[00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:58.320]   So I'm kind of stunned.
[00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:01.280]   They say that GoDaddy could fetch more than a billion dollars.
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:02.080]   A billion.
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:04.160]   Frank Quatron's group, Catalyst Partners,
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:05.200]   is overseeing the sale.
[00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:08.320]   They're the ones who got so much money for three par,
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:11.080]   from Hewlett Packard in that bidding war.
[00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:11.920]   Who was it?
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:14.120]   Hewlett Packard was bidding against--
[00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:15.360]   Who was it? Oracle?
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:16.520]   For three par, I can't remember.
[00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:17.000]   Dell.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:17.840]   Dell, that's right.
[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:20.320]   It went up and up and up.
[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:25.120]   The last domain firm that was sold, I think, was register.com,
[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:27.200]   130 million.
[00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:27.680]   So one--
[00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:28.880]   I understand why they're not doing
[00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:32.280]   a initial public offering instead of this.
[00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:33.080]   Like none of these--
[00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:34.680]   Starbanes.com/NoA solutions.
[00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:37.280]   None of those are publicly traded.
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:40.080]   Well, Starbanes, Oxley, that's the reason.
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:40.680]   Oh, really?
[00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:42.440]   What is Socks?
[00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:43.040]   No, I'm sorry.
[00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:45.200]   Most onerous law ever put in play.
[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:46.200]   That was what it is.
[00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:47.520]   That was the Jeopardy answer.
[00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:49.640]   What are Socks?
[00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:51.520]   What is Socks?
[00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:56.160]   It's the most onerous initiative ever enacted by Congress.
[00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:59.800]   Done around 2002, it's designed to protect bookkeepers
[00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:03.600]   from liability to the extent that it puts all the--
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:06.720]   kind of the onus on the CEOs and all the people
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:09.960]   that are running companies to do all the work
[00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:12.240]   that the public accountants used to do.
[00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:13.920]   And they have to sign off on everything.
[00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:16.080]   And if anything bad happens, they get thrown in jail.
[00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:17.280]   It was a response.
[00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:17.880]   It's in that.
[00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:18.920]   It's in that.
[00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:20.880]   This is why we have no IPOs.
[00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:22.560]   This is why the economy's in the dumper.
[00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:25.040]   This is why we've got no small tech companies
[00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:26.400]   getting public money.
[00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:27.600]   Well, wait a minute, though.
[00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:31.600]   Isn't Facebook saying we're going to go public in 2011?
[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:35.560]   Facebook has said that Facebook isn't going public
[00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:36.400]   anytime soon.
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:37.400]   Really?
[00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:38.600]   Do you really think--
[00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:43.000]   I mean, explain to me why Sorbain's Oxley is crushing.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.080]   Or is nobody-- because if you go-- if you don't go public,
[00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:47.200]   you don't have to adhere to these accounting rules.
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:48.000]   Is that right, Charles?
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:48.920]   No, that's not what it is.
[00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:52.600]   The real reason is because just for compliance alone,
[00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:58.000]   it's been estimated that 4% of your profits are gone
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.200]   from compliance to comply with this law.
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:05.080]   So only the largest companies can actually afford to stay--
[00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:07.360]   This is why markets should be unregulated,
[00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:10.360]   because Americans can protect themselves in the market.
[00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:12.720]   I mean, is this basically a classic, like,
[00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:14.080]   unregulated everything?
[00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:17.640]   And if you're stupid enough to work for a company
[00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:19.480]   that forces you to buy the company, so--
[00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:23.400]   No, you're missing the whole-- but this came out after MCI
[00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:24.440]   and the scammers--
[00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:25.000]   World's kind.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.600]   Yeah, World's kind.
[00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:27.720]   They put this in play.
[00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:29.360]   And if you really look at it carefully,
[00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:30.800]   it doesn't do anything about it.
[00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:33.960]   You go-- MCI would have still gone down the same path
[00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:35.680]   and made off but still be in business.
[00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:38.440]   It doesn't do anything but put a big burden on--
[00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:41.120]   and if you talk to a venture capitalist about this,
[00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:45.280]   any company making less than $400 million a year
[00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:48.720]   cannot afford to be a public company
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:50.880]   because of Sarbanes Oxley.
[00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:51.720]   Look it up.
[00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:52.440]   But check it out.
[00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:53.600]   Nobody thinks it's a good thing.
[00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:55.040]   It's got nothing to do with deregulation.
[00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:56.840]   It was thrown in by the Bush administration
[00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:58.200]   to sink the country.
[00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:00.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:02.200]   OK, there we go.
[00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:03.840]   And actually, I think there has been a move
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:05.680]   to kind of soften Sarbanes Oxley.
[00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:07.960]   Soft and eradicate it.
[00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:08.960]   Yeah.
[00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:11.520]   But I have to say, there have been IPOs.
[00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:13.120]   There have been some IPOs this year.
[00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:14.280]   And I don't know.
[00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:16.720]   I think Facebook's headed towards an IPO.
[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:19.760]   For one reason only, I mean, I'm sure they don't like the regulations
[00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:21.360]   that they're going to have to put up with them.
[00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:23.720]   There's a lot of them, a public company has to put up with.
[00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:25.200]   But there's one reason to do that.
[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:28.120]   And that's because what is the value nowadays, the way you
[00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:31.000]   get engineering talent, is with options.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.920]   And the best way to have options is to have a market.
[00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:35.320]   Well, that's the thing, right?
[00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:36.760]   Can you pay them well enough?
[00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:38.080]   Well, that's the question, right?
[00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:40.440]   The Microsoft lesson is at some point,
[00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:43.600]   you can't drag stock options in front of people
[00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:46.400]   because you can't keep driving the price to stock up in those.
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:46.920]   Exactly.
[00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:48.080]   I'm going to tell you, that's what's
[00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:50.080]   wrong with the tech industry right now.
[00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:51.120]   I've just got a proposal.
[00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:53.320]   I'll let you guys tell me where I'm wrong here.
[00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:55.120]   But I think this is exactly why, for instance,
[00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:58.560]   Google had to launch this silly Google instant this week,
[00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:00.080]   this new form of search, right?
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:04.160]   Because the stock market rewards companies that grow only
[00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:06.160]   if they grow at 25% a year.
[00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:08.640]   They have to grow at at least in the tech sector.
[00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:10.040]   They have to grow at an insane rate.
[00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:12.520]   Microsoft stopped growing at that rate.
[00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:15.280]   Its stock has been flat for years,
[00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:18.120]   which means they can no longer attract the best talent
[00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:19.440]   because they don't have stock options that
[00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:21.040]   are going to inflate every year.
[00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:21.520]   Well, the best--
[00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:22.800]   So everybody went to Google.
[00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:24.360]   Google does an IPO, right?
[00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:25.720]   Google's stock goes up and up and up.
[00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:29.440]   Now Google's flat because no one can grow at 25% a year.
[00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:31.280]   And Google's losing people to Facebook.
[00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:33.720]   And that's why Facebook ultimately has to do an IPO
[00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:35.560]   because they are attracting all the talent.
[00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:39.600]   In fact, Google just lost another big name to Facebook.
[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:40.920]   It's happening all the time.
[00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:43.320]   In fact, yesterday-- did you see this?
[00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:45.440]   Yesterday, a kid writes--
[00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:48.800]   Extantford kid writes something he called YouTube instant.
[00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:51.480]   It's the same kind of search for YouTube that Google's doing.
[00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:55.360]   Chad Hurley at Google/YouTube, the CEO of YouTube,
[00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:56.880]   tweets him saying, nice stuff.
[00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:58.240]   You need a job.
[00:14:58.240 --> 00:14:58.720]   The kid says--
[00:14:58.720 --> 00:14:59.360]   Ready to leave school.
[00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:00.840]   Ready to leave-- well, for the kids,
[00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:03.640]   Faros says, is that a serious offer?
[00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:05.480]   And Chad says, are you ready to leave school?
[00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:06.720]   DM me.
[00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:08.760]   Presumably, Google's offering this good a job.
[00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:09.400]   Why?
[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:11.680]   Not because YouTube instant is so great
[00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:13.760]   because you've got to get these guys before they figure out
[00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:16.360]   the whole stock option thing and go to Facebook.
[00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:18.680]   Or you create an environment where
[00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:21.080]   you have a bunch of smart people and intelligent
[00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:22.080]   management decisions.
[00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:23.520]   It doesn't work.
[00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:26.600]   Isn't Google like that?
[00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:27.880]   So one guy leaves Google.
[00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:28.640]   Therefore, Google is--
[00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:29.760]   Oh, hundreds have left Google.
[00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:32.360]   Google's got a major brain drain to Facebook.
[00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:35.000]   Everybody has major-- people get bored.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.480]   Programmers are like ADD half the time.
[00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:38.440]   John, help me out here.
[00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:40.040]   Isn't that really what's going on?
[00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:42.160]   Is that if they can't offer valuable stock options,
[00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:45.560]   they can't keep these kids who just want money?
[00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:47.480]   You know, I actually--
[00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:50.680]   I'm in agreement with you in theory.
[00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:54.160]   And from 10 years ago, I would say, yeah, yeah, yeah,
[00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:55.240]   absolutely.
[00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:57.760]   But that deal is--
[00:15:57.760 --> 00:15:59.760]   that trains left as far as I'm concerned.
[00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:02.720]   I think guys now are just looking for any job that
[00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:03.560]   has some security.
[00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:05.080]   But we're also talking about the millennials who are--
[00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:06.360]   I'm talking about the best-- no, no, no.
[00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:08.280]   You're right when it's talking about everybody.
[00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:10.240]   But I'm talking about the best and the brightest, whatever.
[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:12.200]   It is 100 great engineers graduating
[00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:14.840]   each year from Stanford and MIT and Cal Poly.
[00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:17.240]   Well, you know, if Sharp A's oxy was gone,
[00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:19.200]   we would have all these little companies.
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:21.280]   Nice job, John, for the win.
[00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:23.800]   Brings it back to Sox.
[00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:27.000]   I mean, I have a bunch of friends who went to school.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.520]   One of them just sold--
[00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:31.040]   his company just sold for $20 million to Motorola.
[00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:34.240]   Another one is a pretty amazing security start.
[00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:35.760]   Well, I mean, they got out of school like, you know,
[00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:37.000]   five, seven years ago now.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.840]   But a lot of the guys getting out of school today
[00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:40.360]   and women for that matter are basically
[00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:42.760]   coming up with the right idea, getting together,
[00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:45.120]   a crew of people they trust, and starting their own company.
[00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:46.120]   Yeah.
[00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:48.440]   I mean, no, no, this is a good time to be entrepreneurial
[00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:50.160]   as opposed to going to work for a big corporation.
[00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:51.160]   So maybe that's the problem.
[00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:53.040]   It's always a good time to be entrepreneurial.
[00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:56.520]   Was there not a flow of the best minds from Microsoft to Google
[00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:57.840]   and now from Google to Facebook?
[00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:59.520]   Is that not happening?
[00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:01.040]   You know, maybe they were just looking
[00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:03.560]   for that environment that they encountered the first time
[00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:04.280]   around and--
[00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:06.480]   Oh, they want somewhere cool and exciting and growing.
[00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:09.400]   You know, I mean, there is a certain amount of energy
[00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:12.480]   and vitality when you get to--
[00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:14.760]   when you're given, you know, essentially the keys.
[00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:17.120]   I met a new small place, so I'm going to do this.
[00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:17.800]   You know what it also is?
[00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:19.520]   It's free agency, too.
[00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:20.520]   Wow.
[00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:22.840]   How much will you pay me?
[00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:24.440]   You know, John, we've lost John.
[00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:24.840]   We've lost John.
[00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:25.280]   We've lost John.
[00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:25.840]   We've lost John.
[00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:26.520]   We've lost John.
[00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:27.040]   We've lost John.
[00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:27.520]   We've lost John.
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:28.040]   We've lost John.
[00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:28.520]   We've lost John.
[00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:29.040]   We've lost John.
[00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:29.040]   We've lost John.
[00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:29.520]   We've lost John.
[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:30.040]   We've lost John.
[00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:30.600]   We've lost John.
[00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:31.040]   We've lost John.
[00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:31.520]   We've lost John.
[00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:32.040]   We've lost John.
[00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:32.760]   We've lost John.
[00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:33.400]   We've lost John.
[00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:33.960]   We've lost John.
[00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:34.360]   We've lost John.
[00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:35.120]   We've lost John.
[00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:35.720]   We've lost John.
[00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:36.320]   We've lost John.
[00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:37.120]   We've lost John.
[00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:38.120]   We've lost John.
[00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:45.160]   So, to go back to the original question, John, so they're going to take the big check
[00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:50.040]   from a holding company at GoDaddy instead of going for an IPO.
[00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:54.160]   And that's entirely due to Sorbaine's Oxley or because it's easier or it's because it's
[00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:55.680]   faster, easier and simpler.
[00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:57.120]   And they might make more money.
[00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:58.120]   Yeah.
[00:17:58.120 --> 00:17:59.120]   I'm a billion.
[00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:00.840]   In fact, some are saying a billion.
[00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:01.680]   That's the starting point.
[00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:02.680]   They're going to get 1.4.
[00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:05.480]   I mean, if it's a multiple of 800 million.
[00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:06.480]   800 million.
[00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:09.560]   You know, I've always thought Bob Parsons was a good guy.
[00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:10.560]   Really?
[00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:11.560]   Do you like Bob?
[00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:14.720]   Well, you know, he used to do this thing called Rat Pack or something like that back
[00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:16.200]   in the day.
[00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:20.200]   He was the one of the first guys who had these personal organizing software systems.
[00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:21.200]   I'm going to have to rethink.
[00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:22.200]   Oh, he did Rat Pack.
[00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:23.200]   I remember that.
[00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:24.440]   Yeah, it was some crazy thing.
[00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:27.240]   It was like he was always calling everybody in all the magazines.
[00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:28.640]   And he was really a nice guy.
[00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:30.400]   He was down in San Diego, I believe.
[00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:31.560]   Well, he's now in Scottsdale.
[00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:36.840]   I'll give you, you know, I have had bad thoughts about GoDaddy for a couple of reasons.
[00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:38.360]   One is all the upsell stuff.
[00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:40.280]   That's why they make 800 million.
[00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:42.040]   It's not on the 995.
[00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:46.600]   It's the 15 different offers that you take to get out of that hell with the checkout
[00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:49.400]   hell there.
[00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:50.400]   And I don't always bug me.
[00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:54.240]   I always bug me the sexy ads with the come on, come to the website and see Dan.
[00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:55.240]   I like the sexy ads.
[00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:56.440]   Bob's an old guy.
[00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:59.160]   So he's, you know, I guess he's an old horn dog.
[00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:00.320]   So he ran all these ads.
[00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:03.120]   Pretty much what I, the feeling I get from it, that's all.
[00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:04.120]   All right.
[00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:05.480]   No, you guys aren't going to say anything bad about him.
[00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:06.920]   So I'm not going to say anything bad about him.
[00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:07.920]   Bob, I love you.
[00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:08.920]   You're beautiful.
[00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:09.920]   Don't ever change.
[00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:10.920]   How you should have invited him on actually to talk about it.
[00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:11.920]   He, I bet you would have done it.
[00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:14.560]   He's got his own show every week that he keeps calling me.
[00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:16.360]   He keeps calling me.
[00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:17.360]   Yeah.
[00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:18.360]   Does he?
[00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:19.360]   Well, he called me once.
[00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:20.360]   He keeps his probably a little strong.
[00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:23.000]   I'm calling once.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.320]   He wanted to talk because I, because I've been pretty hard on him.
[00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:26.560]   I always like the guy.
[00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:27.560]   All right.
[00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:28.560]   So I'm going to rethink because I like you, John.
[00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:30.760]   If you like him, he can only be half bad.
[00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:32.880]   I love the videos he does on his website though.
[00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:36.280]   His weekly podcast is pretty cool as far as business.
[00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:40.520]   He gives some valuable information while people try to start their businesses and stuff.
[00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:44.240]   Going to the whole sexy commercial thing, my only complaint really is that he says,
[00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:46.080]   go to the commercial to see the unrated version.
[00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:47.080]   Right.
[00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:48.080]   Yeah, and rated versions essentially what they just said.
[00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:49.080]   Exactly.
[00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:50.080]   It's the same thing.
[00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:51.080]   It's such a like cheesy.
[00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:52.080]   It's cheesy.
[00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:53.080]   And now how would you know that?
[00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:54.080]   Well, free porn research.
[00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:55.480]   There's no free porn.
[00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:56.480]   It was pure research.
[00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:58.480]   Leo took the hit for the team.
[00:19:58.480 --> 00:19:59.480]   All right.
[00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:02.280]   I'm going to talk just a second about it.
[00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:03.280]   Bus did.
[00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:05.240]   Hey, I like porn.
[00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:06.240]   Who doesn't like porn?
[00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:07.240]   Okay.
[00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:10.400]   I'm going to come out on this one because this is the dirty little secret of the internet.
[00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:11.400]   Is it like porn?
[00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:13.720]   No, that 90% of internet traffic's porn.
[00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:14.720]   90?
[00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:16.520]   Without 90% of internet traffic.
[00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:17.520]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:19.120]   But in which we can see.
[00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:23.200]   I'm sorry, 90% of internet traffic is peer to peer files sharing.
[00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:25.080]   I thought it was porn movies.
[00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:26.480]   But it's like the last three years.
[00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:31.960]   90% of the internet traffic has either been spam, video, pornography, nobody bit torrent,
[00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:36.520]   depending on which BSPR report is trying to convince which congressman of what.
[00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:39.200]   It's the fact that they're not speak its name.
[00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:40.200]   I hear people.
[00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:41.200]   Yeah.
[00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:44.320]   You know, after a while, all those sites kind of look the same don't they.
[00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:45.320]   Every time you see the little banner.
[00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:46.680]   You see the one you've seen them all.
[00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:51.320]   Well, based on like all the junk email and banners I say floating around.
[00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:52.320]   All right.
[00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:54.920]   I'm going to talk about something much more interesting.
[00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:56.920]   One of the hottest.
[00:20:56.920 --> 00:21:04.040]   Yes, apparently, according to some, one of the hottest properties out there right now.
[00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:06.400]   There was a very interesting expose.
[00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:08.640]   I think it was an SF weekly.
[00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:14.220]   Their motto, the guy in the former employee, the disgruntled former employee says is do
[00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:16.120]   evil.
[00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:17.120]   Do evil.
[00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:18.280]   We'll talk about that in just a second.
[00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:23.440]   But you know, she ever get to drive any great Ford Fiesta's when you're in that.
[00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:25.440]   You laugh at that.
[00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:28.720]   I love the Ford Fiesta.
[00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:30.520]   Actually, it's a fun car to drive.
[00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:31.520]   It's cute.
[00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:32.520]   Yes.
[00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:35.600]   I remember when that CHP officer looked over his shoulder or shook his head.
[00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:36.600]   I was doing.
[00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:40.400]   I got to sit in the fun for it, but it wasn't a Fiesta.
[00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:42.400]   What Ford was that?
[00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:43.400]   GT 40.
[00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:51.200]   Oh, I drive a GT at 2010 GT and I'm looking at the five oh but there's that Shelby.
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:53.400]   It is so beautiful.
[00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:54.400]   It's such a sweet car.
[00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:55.760]   Now see that's made for drifting.
[00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:56.760]   That's made for drifting.
[00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:58.960]   You're talking about the Ford Fiesta.
[00:21:58.960 --> 00:21:59.960]   What's the GT?
[00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:00.960]   What's that?
[00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:04.800]   That's the one that used, not the replica, but the update to the car that used to run
[00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:05.800]   the lemons, right?
[00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:06.800]   Yes.
[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:07.800]   Yes.
[00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:10.400]   Oh, I should never get a conversation with car buffs.
[00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:11.680]   Oh, that's sweet.
[00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:12.680]   Is it a Mustang?
[00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:13.680]   No.
[00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:14.680]   What is it?
[00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:15.680]   No, no, no.
[00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:16.680]   It's a GT.
[00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:17.680]   Yeah, it's a GT.
[00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:19.800]   Oh, no, I did hear there were some issues with the transax.
[00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:21.600]   Does it have a transaxle?
[00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:22.600]   I don't remember.
[00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:24.200]   There were some issues with it cracking or something.
[00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:28.480]   That's never getting a conversation with a guy who reads Jane's auto monthly.
[00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:29.480]   They don't have a...
[00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:30.480]   I saw one of those things floating over there.
[00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:31.480]   Oh, that's sweet.
[00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:32.480]   Oh, that's a sweet couple weeks ago.
[00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:33.480]   That's a nice looking car.
[00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:35.040]   Patrick's showing me right now.
[00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:36.040]   Yeah.
[00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:37.040]   Oh, that's sweet.
[00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:38.040]   A nice car.
[00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:39.040]   Well, okay.
[00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:41.240]   Can't that Leo?
[00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:43.960]   Many of us would like to drive a car like that but can't afford it.
[00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:46.480]   Perhaps you'd like a car that gets 40 miles to the gallon highway.
[00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:47.480]   How about that?
[00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:48.800]   According to EPA estimates.
[00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:53.440]   Maybe you'd prefer that.
[00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:54.440]   And affordable.
[00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:56.080]   Maybe you would like a Ford Fiesta.
[00:22:56.080 --> 00:23:01.280]   You know one of the best parts of the Ford Fiesta has got that great Ford Sync.
[00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:03.240]   I cleaned up the kit.
[00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:05.080]   What are you looking at me like that Roger?
[00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:06.880]   I'm not looking at you.
[00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:08.360]   Do you ever try the Ford Sync?
[00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:09.760]   Yeah, no, I think it's great.
[00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:11.640]   I used it in the Lincoln and I used it.
[00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:12.640]   There you go.
[00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:13.640]   Okay, yeah.
[00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:14.640]   Ford Lincoln and Mercury vehicles.
[00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:15.640]   I got it.
[00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:16.640]   Yeah.
[00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:17.640]   I was in the other day.
[00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:19.720]   I used to drive because the kids have that right now.
[00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:20.720]   The kids have the license.
[00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:22.080]   Yeah, well, it's at all.
[00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:23.240]   It's 10 years old.
[00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:25.880]   But I was really missing the sync because I get in the car.
[00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:27.160]   I've got my Android phone.
[00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:29.320]   It reads me text messages come in.
[00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:30.640]   It reads me the text messages.
[00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:31.640]   Nice.
[00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:32.640]   It's got pre-programmed responses.
[00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:37.320]   I can just, the idea is you never take your hands off the wheel or your eyes off the road.
[00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:40.200]   You don't even have to take the keys out of your pocket to open the door.
[00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:41.200]   So sweet.
[00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:42.200]   Yeah.
[00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:43.200]   No, it's a back.
[00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:44.200]   It's a benefit.
[00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:45.200]   You saw that viral ad they did.
[00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:46.200]   That was so funny.
[00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:47.200]   Yeah, you just get in.
[00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:48.280]   The wireless fuel system.
[00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:50.280]   I love that.
[00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:52.800]   Power shift, six-speed automatic transmission.
[00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:54.600]   There's options like heated leather trim seats.
[00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:56.400]   I mean, this is not, you're not giving up a lot.
[00:23:56.400 --> 00:24:00.840]   That 1.6 liter Duretec, T-I-V-C-T, I-4 engine.
[00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:02.560]   Did I say that right, Patrick?
[00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:03.560]   Yes.
[00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:04.560]   The easy fuel, capless fuel filter.
[00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:05.560]   I'm reading crap.
[00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:07.320]   I don't know what the hell it is.
[00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:12.560]   A four-inch multi-functional display with LCD screen and responsive and nimble performance.
[00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:13.560]   I know about that.
[00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:17.440]   I'm not sure if you're in your Ford Fiesta at your local Ford dealer.
[00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:21.560]   Yeah, if you look at the video that they did on Top Gear with the Fiesta, they like it.
[00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:24.800]   Like cornering inside of a mall being chased by a Corvette.
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:27.640]   And it's a little beat it because it can corner 10 times better than the Corvette was
[00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:28.640]   able to.
[00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:33.640]   And then they did a beach landing where they had the Ford Fiesta land on the beaches if
[00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:34.800]   they're storming the beach.
[00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:40.560]   It was one of the most amazing Top Gear spots I've ever seen with featuring the Fiesta.
[00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:44.200]   And I was almost certain they sponsored it, but I think they were just decided to make
[00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:45.200]   the spot that entertaining.
[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:49.960]   It was basically a fluff piece for the Fiesta, but just because the darn car handles that
[00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:50.960]   well.
[00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:51.960]   It's fun.
[00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:52.960]   They brought one over and I drove it around.
[00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:53.960]   It's just really fun.
[00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:55.400]   I want you to take a look at it.
[00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:58.120]   All the Fords, all the Lincoln's, all the Mercury's because you really want that Ford
[00:24:58.120 --> 00:24:59.120]   Sync.
[00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:00.960]   And I think the Ford Fiesta is fantastic.
[00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:03.640]   Drive one this week at a Ford dealer near you.
[00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:07.040]   We thank them for their support of this week in tech.
[00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:08.040]   And there it is.
[00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:11.480]   And see, I thought because that's the GT Mustang.
[00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:13.120]   I thought that's what you're talking about.
[00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:14.120]   Yoshi.
[00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:15.120]   That's fun though.
[00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:18.680]   Yoshi, will you come out here and teach me how to drift?
[00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:19.680]   Sure.
[00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:23.160]   We can see your car right, Leo.
[00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:24.160]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:25.160]   We'll use my car.
[00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:26.560]   I use the Lexus that you gave your kids.
[00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:27.560]   You can't.
[00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:28.560]   It's front wheel drive.
[00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:33.000]   When we went out on the test track at Ford, they had the new 2011 Shelby and the guy took
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   me out.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.520]   And he was like, I mean, he practically had the things spinning around.
[00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:38.560]   I mean, it was amazing.
[00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:42.000]   I threw up a couple of times, but that's your Lexus's front wheel drive.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   Isn't it?
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   No.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   What models yet?
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   Oh, I thought it was.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   Show now.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   I know.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.720]   Well, the low end is basically an up I have a GS.
[00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:57.560]   I had a GS 300 is 2001, 2001 is Henry driving it.
[00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:01.080]   He will if he ever gets a license 16 years old and he doesn't have a license.
[00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:03.560]   It's like you have my license on a station kids today.
[00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:04.560]   Kids today.
[00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:10.560]   Where did God writing their bicycles and converting cars to biodiesel saving the environment,
[00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:11.560]   all that crap.
[00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:12.560]   Good for him.
[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:13.560]   What's wrong with them?
[00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:14.560]   Whoa, Leo.
[00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:15.560]   Whoa.
[00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:17.560]   There's just a reflection of their parents.
[00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:21.800]   No, I don't know why, but Henry, my daughter, you know, the minute she was 15 and a half
[00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:23.000]   learners permit driving.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   Give me the keys.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:25.240]   Give me the keys.
[00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:26.240]   And so that's the car she drove.
[00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:27.840]   And then Henry, that's, you know, she's gone.
[00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:28.840]   She's a college.
[00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:29.740]   So that's a car hairdryph.
[00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:31.920]   So did you see this article about Farmville?
[00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:34.520]   A couple of interesting things.
[00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:42.880]   First of all, the expose with the former Farmville employee who said basically Zinga steals
[00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:44.840]   any game they can.
[00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:47.760]   The goal is don't worry about originality.
[00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:50.880]   Just worry about hooking our users.
[00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:53.080]   They've been sued before if they were sued over mafia wars.
[00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:57.240]   Farmville is the one that everybody's playing not only on Facebook, but now they have it
[00:26:57.240 --> 00:27:01.280]   on, I think it's an app for iOS.
[00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:06.840]   So there's this secret thing, Gawker revealed this Ryan Tate writing for Gawker called the
[00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:10.800]   Platonum purchase program for Zinga.
[00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:15.800]   Normally in Farmville, you can only buy about $200 worth of whatever those points are called
[00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:18.160]   to allow you to build the pony barn and stuff like that.
[00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:23.320]   They're spending real money for digital, you know, goods, but they have a special Platonum
[00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:29.760]   purchase program, which allows you of a minimum purchase of $500.
[00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:31.520]   You have to use wire transfer.
[00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:33.800]   You can't use a credit card.
[00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:35.720]   You get extra points.
[00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:40.400]   If you for a friend, you get more points.
[00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:43.480]   And there are apparently, and nobody's talking about this, people are spending thousands of
[00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:52.080]   dollars a month on little pony points, obsessive gaming junkies, many of them underaged or
[00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:53.080]   low income.
[00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:57.200]   New York Times discovered an unemployed disabled guy was spending 16 hours a day on
[00:27:57.200 --> 00:28:02.520]   Yowville, another one of the Zinga properties.
[00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:09.800]   And according to this disillusioned ex employee, Mark Pincus, the CEO, has a predatory attitude
[00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:13.520]   towards gamers, has told his programmers that pumping up profits is more important than
[00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:22.840]   the actual play and that Darmato is unofficially do evil.
[00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:23.840]   And the problem is?
[00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:26.680]   I like it.
[00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:29.880]   Suck through these people and take their money and take their money.
[00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:33.440]   Please they're begging to really is it okay?
[00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:35.440]   Robert, it's buying pony points.
[00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:39.920]   Is it okay though that this is, you know, and I have to say this is kind of the problem
[00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:41.120]   a little bit I have with Facebook too.
[00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:45.640]   It's more it feels more like a compulsion than an actual enjoyable thing.
[00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:49.840]   Zinga's games, according to the SESF weekly article are built around a compulsion loop.
[00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:50.840]   Yep.
[00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:51.840]   Yes.
[00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:52.840]   All video games.
[00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:55.200]   All our machines are built around a compulsion loop.
[00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:56.720]   Shopping is built around a compulsion loop.
[00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:59.760]   Credit cards are built around a compulsion loop is built around a compulsion loop.
[00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:00.760]   Yeah.
[00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:01.760]   Yeah.
[00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:04.640]   I was also pointing out that really that the it was the disgruntled former employee.
[00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:05.640]   Yeah.
[00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:07.240]   That's in his motto was do evil.
[00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:08.240]   Right.
[00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:09.240]   So new.
[00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:10.240]   Yeah.
[00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:11.240]   My high pay game developers contract.
[00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:14.160]   Oh, I didn't want to renew it again and just to hand it and receive all that money to
[00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:16.800]   develop these relatively simple but addictive games.
[00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:20.200]   So so so you guys, do you play farm bill?
[00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:21.200]   Robert?
[00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:22.200]   No.
[00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:23.200]   No.
[00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:24.200]   No.
[00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:26.560]   You spend any time on Facebook at all.
[00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:27.560]   I think Carrie.
[00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:29.000]   I spent a lot on Facebook.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.560]   I don't play farm bill or yo-ville or I do it.
[00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:34.480]   I do it play a lot of words with friends.
[00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:35.480]   That's my one.
[00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:37.520]   I love words with friends.
[00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:39.120]   Can I play with you?
[00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:40.120]   Yeah.
[00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:42.600]   What's what's your handle?
[00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:43.600]   Uh oh.
[00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:44.600]   Yoshi.
[00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:45.600]   Yoshi.
[00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:46.600]   Oh, I should find should be able to find that.
[00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:47.600]   Cool.
[00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:50.000]   I love words with frets that Scrabble clone.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   That's not.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   Yeah.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   It's not.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   It's not.

[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   It's not.
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   It's not.

[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   It's not.
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   It's not.
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   It's not.
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   It's not.
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   It's not.
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   It's not.
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   It's not.
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   It's not.
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   It's not.
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   It's not.
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   It's not.
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   It's not.
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   It's not.
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   It's not.
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   It's not.
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   It's not.
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   It's just a scare tactic.
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   Yeah, sure.
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   You can get some dumb kid to sign anything.
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   And that's fine.
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   And you can buffalo him into thinking he can't talk.
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   That's good too.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   That's just kind of fooling a dummy.
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   But the fact of the matter is if these things are held as
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.000]   legal documents by the courts, then the court should be
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   ashamed of themselves.
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   That's what I'm complaining about.
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   You buy a game now from electronic arts.
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   It says you don't own the game.
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   You're licensing the game.
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   You don't.
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   I mean, at what point does that product?
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   I mean, moving back to the original discussion.
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   Thank you, Roger.
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   At what point does the product just?
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   I mean, do they treat it as a product or do they treat it as a
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   service?
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   Well, I think this is where this is where it gets muddy because
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:17.000]   it's software, right?
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   Yeah.
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   So technically, there's not even a physical, necessarily a physical
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   copy of it.
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   It's bits.
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   You're buying an idea.
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   I mean, you know, one or at least a
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   couple of things that you're not going to be able to do.
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   You're not going to be able to do that.
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   You're not going to be able to do that.
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   You're not going to be able to do that.
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   You're not going to be able to do that.
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   You're not going to be able to do that.
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   You're not going to be able to do that.
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:35.000]   You're not going to be able to do that.
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   You're not going to be able to do that.
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   You're not going to be able to do that.
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   You're not going to be able to do that.
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:39.000]   You're not going to be able to do that.
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   You're not going to be able to do that.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   You're not going to be able to do that.
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   You're not going to be able to do that.
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   You're not going to be able to do that.
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   You're not going to be able to do that.
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   You're not going to be able to do that.
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   You're not going to be able to do that.
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:35.000]   You're not going to be able to do that.
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   You're not going to be able to do that.
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   You're not going to be able to do that.
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   You're not going to be able to do that.
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:03.000]   You're not going to be able to do that.
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   You're not going to be able to do that.
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:17.000]   You're not going to be able to do that.
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   You're not going to be able to do that.
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:31.000]   You're not going to be able to do that.
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   You're not going to be able to do that.
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   You're not going to be able to do that.
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:52.000]   You're not going to be able to do that.
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   You can even make the rental digital.
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   As soon as the semester ends, it gets auto-deletes from your candle.
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   Do we have a problem with that or is that okay?
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   Are you giving up a little freedom for a little convenience?
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   Do we have to do that?
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:32.000]   I would submit that the problem is that we're in the middle of a transition from physical
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:34.000]   goods to virtual goods.
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   This is where this judgment is a problem because that auto-cat software was really
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   perceived by the plaintiff as a physical good that he could resell,
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   perceived by the creator as a virtual good that you just really rented the right.
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:51.000]   That's a problem because in the long run you're not going to buy a physical good.
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   You're buying bits or renting bits I should say.
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   Isn't that better for everybody all along?
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:57.000]   No, it's not better for everybody.
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   Why not, John?
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:44:59.000]   This is a scam.
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:02.000]   This is just a way to get more money out of your pocket.
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:03.000]   I don't think so, John.
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:06.000]   I think really if you think about it, that's what software is.
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   Seymour Rubenstein is the guy who kind of got this whole ball rolling when he came up with
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:17.000]   the shrink wrap licensing agreement back in the 80s when he was doing WordStar.
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   Actually before that there was some merge purge program.
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:21.000]   WordStar.
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:22.000]   I missed it.
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:26.000]   I had many a talk with this guy and he says he was hoping that he says this is the way to
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:29.000]   go and he was talking about how everything can be licensed.
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:33.000]   You wouldn't own anything ever and it would just mean more money for these guys because
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   it wouldn't be a secondary market.
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   There wouldn't be a gray market which people love to hate if they don't want, if they
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:40.000]   want to screw the public.
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   This is all about screwing the public.
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:46.000]   Don't let me be able to hand a book to you that I just read.
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:47.000]   Screw it.
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   You have to buy a new copy.
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:51.000]   That whole kind of that whole model sucks as far as I'm concerned.
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:53.000]   That's because you're an old fart.
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   Really?
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:55.000]   It's just ideas.
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   It's just bits.
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   You don't really want to hold on to it, John.
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:45:59.000]   Really do you?
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   I mean after you've read it.
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:01.000]   If you want to give it to you, Lee.
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   Well that's stealing.
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:03.000]   How is that stealing?
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.000]   It's not stealing with books.
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:07.000]   It wouldn't be if we're a car.
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:12.000]   If the book had a Yule printed inside of it, it would be stealing.
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   It would be considered stealing under this law.
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:15.000]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:16.000]   And you think that's good?
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:17.440]   No, I don't think that's good.
[00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:18.440]   There's a reason I buy CDs.
[00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:20.000]   There's a reason I buy Blu-rays.
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:22.000]   A, I want a physical copy of the media.
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:23.000]   I think.
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:25.720]   And B, I want the best possible quality of the data.
[00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:26.720]   And you know what?
[00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:28.720]   A lot of the online distribution of media sucks.
[00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:30.800]   A lot of the 720p.
[00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:34.520]   Physical media is going to be a boutique industry for people like you who care about the content,
[00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:36.240]   the quality of the content.
[00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:40.440]   And want to for some crazy reason think that it's good to own a movie.
[00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:43.600]   The rest of us will just buy the right to view it for two days.
[00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:48.880]   I think what you'll eventually see is you'll see a parallel market where creators and the
[00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:54.040]   end users will directly interface instead of working through a publisher, a middleman
[00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:55.600]   company that does.
[00:46:55.600 --> 00:46:58.560]   I mean, if you think about it, if you go to a band and they say, "Hey, you know what?
[00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:00.760]   We just made these CDs in our garage.
[00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:02.120]   We'll sell it to you for like $10.
[00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:03.560]   You get all our music and stuff."
[00:47:03.560 --> 00:47:06.480]   Instead of going through a reprise record.
[00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:13.560]   Why is it okay in textbooks but not okay in Ernest Hemingway?
[00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:18.040]   Is it because textbooks have less, well, I mean, we just endorsed the notion that you
[00:47:18.040 --> 00:47:22.760]   could, that you don't own a textbook and there's no resell right as being good for
[00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:23.760]   everybody in the cost of the last.
[00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:24.760]   No, no, no.
[00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:25.760]   I said it was a successful business model.
[00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:26.960]   Oh, you don't like the idea.
[00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:31.200]   Look, I remember textbooks were in a hundred bucks when I was in college.
[00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:32.600]   I was in college forever ago.
[00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:33.880]   I was also a lit major.
[00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:36.000]   So half the stuff I was buying was paid for books.
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:37.160]   It was novels, right?
[00:47:37.160 --> 00:47:40.560]   I know people who have had to, you know, in the last couple, three years, we've had to
[00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:45.800]   lay out like six, seven hundred bucks up front a semester for their books for like three
[00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:46.800]   or four classes.
[00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:47.800]   Right.
[00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:48.800]   My name is Ernest Hemingway.
[00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:49.800]   My name is Ernest Hemingway.
[00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:52.120]   And you don't really want a textbook after you've completed the class.
[00:47:52.120 --> 00:47:53.280]   It loses its value immediately.
[00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:54.280]   Where is Ernest Hemingway?
[00:47:54.280 --> 00:47:55.280]   Might have value down there.
[00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:56.280]   Yeah.
[00:47:56.280 --> 00:47:58.360]   I mean, there's not a lot of people going like, boy, I'm going to want this accounting 101
[00:47:58.360 --> 00:48:01.840]   book forever so I can look back at those first days of double entry.
[00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:02.840]   Right.
[00:48:02.840 --> 00:48:03.840]   So textbooks, it kind of makes sense.
[00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:04.840]   Textbooks, it kind of makes sense.
[00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:06.200]   You pay half price up front.
[00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:08.040]   You give them the book back in the end of the semester.
[00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:09.040]   They rent it again.
[00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:10.040]   Right.
[00:48:10.040 --> 00:48:11.840]   They're not allowed to run the highlighter in the edges.
[00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:12.840]   You know.
[00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:16.440]   Well, you can if you just have a Kindle that allows you to do that.
[00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:17.440]   Right.
[00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:19.440]   But in this case, they're actually renting physical copies of this.
[00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:20.440]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:22.440]   But that's why I guess ultimately digital.
[00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:26.640]   You know, this is the idealism, this idea because many of the textbooks get updated
[00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:29.360]   yearly just to prevent this sort of thing.
[00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:33.560]   For a long time, the used textbook market was very vibrant in most colleges.
[00:48:33.560 --> 00:48:34.560]   Oh, it still is.
[00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:35.560]   California.
[00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:38.680]   No, well, you go to University of California with those used textbooks places.
[00:48:38.680 --> 00:48:43.160]   They're all gone because now the professors are in bed with these publishers and they
[00:48:43.160 --> 00:48:45.480]   keep they have to sign new books.
[00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:49.240]   They have to be the newest version because there's something changed on page 50.
[00:48:49.240 --> 00:48:50.240]   A correction.
[00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:51.240]   It's part of the giant scam.
[00:48:51.240 --> 00:48:54.320]   We're just having our money stolen from us.
[00:48:54.320 --> 00:48:55.320]   Again with a scam.
[00:48:55.320 --> 00:48:56.320]   It's a scam.
[00:48:56.320 --> 00:48:57.320]   It's just a real.
[00:48:57.320 --> 00:49:00.280]   The public base to stand up is crap.
[00:49:00.280 --> 00:49:04.560]   If you're going to have books that cost as much as they do, it would be in my best interest.
[00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:07.440]   I think for the students best interest is not to saddle them with all that initial expense
[00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:09.980]   right off the bat when they're getting started in school and just be able to provide that
[00:49:09.980 --> 00:49:14.120]   digitally in such a way where, you know, make it as affordable as possible or to the
[00:49:14.120 --> 00:49:16.800]   point where it shouldn't even be a cost to the student.
[00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:19.760]   It's like if they sign up for a course, here's the digital download.
[00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:22.360]   Just go to town with it and use it as as you see fit.
[00:49:22.360 --> 00:49:23.360]   There you go.
[00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:24.360]   Socialism.
[00:49:24.360 --> 00:49:28.840]   For some kind of, but for software though, we've been dealing with this at least on the
[00:49:28.840 --> 00:49:31.920]   gaming side of things for PCs for a long time now.
[00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:35.400]   You could not open as soon as you took the shrink wrap off the outside of the box, you
[00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:36.680]   effectively owned it.
[00:49:36.680 --> 00:49:42.520]   You couldn't return it for almost no reason short of physical defect or fortunately, sometimes
[00:49:42.520 --> 00:49:46.440]   you'll actually get a piece of software so bad that you had to actually, you could declare
[00:49:46.440 --> 00:49:48.520]   it a defective piece of software and then return it.
[00:49:48.520 --> 00:49:51.080]   But even today, it's still the same way.
[00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:55.960]   You know, what gets me about that, I don't even, you know, that's that model that train
[00:49:55.960 --> 00:49:57.160]   also has left the station.
[00:49:57.160 --> 00:50:00.840]   We're stuck with this model, but what gets me is the fact that they can put into those
[00:50:00.840 --> 00:50:03.240]   Ulas liability considerations.
[00:50:03.240 --> 00:50:07.520]   So in other words, if you're using this software in a hospital and somebody dies because the
[00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:13.480]   software is crap or doesn't work as it as advertised, it doesn't do what it's supposed
[00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:16.440]   to do and people actually die from the software.
[00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:17.760]   You can't do anything about it.
[00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:18.760]   That's ridiculous.
[00:50:18.760 --> 00:50:19.760]   I agree.
[00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:21.840]   You some kind of Yule Reform should be there.
[00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:22.840]   There should be like a basic.
[00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:24.440]   But a lot of Yule is fall apart in support.
[00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:28.920]   I mean, they write a lot of stuff in the Yule is that we all know is bogus.
[00:50:28.920 --> 00:50:29.920]   Right around.
[00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:33.080]   And for a while there that would actually check your Yule for you.
[00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:37.120]   That's all we need to see if there's any suspect language in it.
[00:50:37.120 --> 00:50:41.160]   And honestly, as funny as those pieces of software are, it'd be better if most of us
[00:50:41.160 --> 00:50:43.720]   probably use them because we, I don't read Yule's.
[00:50:43.720 --> 00:50:44.920]   I'll be perfectly honest with you.
[00:50:44.920 --> 00:50:48.280]   I need whatever I just purchased installed that moment and I'm just going to click the
[00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:50.360]   buttons until until the magic happens.
[00:50:50.360 --> 00:50:51.840]   So I need to take a break.
[00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:54.080]   Yoshi, are you okay in the car there still?
[00:50:54.080 --> 00:50:55.080]   Oh, yeah.
[00:50:55.080 --> 00:50:56.720]   I miss you, Yoshi.
[00:50:56.720 --> 00:50:59.720]   Do you ever come up to Northern California?
[00:50:59.720 --> 00:51:01.720]   Two times a year.
[00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:04.720]   Come up and say hi sometime, will you?
[00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:05.720]   Yeah.
[00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:07.040]   Love to see you.
[00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:08.040]   We are having fun.
[00:51:08.040 --> 00:51:10.040]   This is a Twit reunion.
[00:51:10.040 --> 00:51:11.560]   And I, yeah, I'd love to make your appearance.
[00:51:11.560 --> 00:51:13.520]   Have you make an appearance at the cottage?
[00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:17.160]   This is a Twit reunion of the voices that you might have heard.
[00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:21.080]   If you listen to Twit way back in 2005, Roger Chang is here.
[00:51:21.080 --> 00:51:23.920]   He's now, you guys all now work together, which is kind of cool too.
[00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:26.320]   Roger Chang works at Taexilla.
[00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:31.160]   Of course, Taexilla's host, this guy here, Mr. Patrick Norton.
[00:51:31.160 --> 00:51:34.400]   Also on the phone with us, Robert Heron who does HD Nation with Patrick Norton, John
[00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:38.160]   C. Devorak, who works with nobody.
[00:51:38.160 --> 00:51:41.040]   So we appear on the show every now and once in a while.
[00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:42.040]   I can see why.
[00:51:42.040 --> 00:51:43.800]   All I do is complain.
[00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:45.480]   Everybody, everybody loves John C. Devorak.
[00:51:45.480 --> 00:51:47.160]   He's the father of us all.
[00:51:47.160 --> 00:51:48.160]   Oh, God.
[00:51:48.160 --> 00:51:49.720]   And David Prager, who's at revision three.
[00:51:49.720 --> 00:51:53.120]   In fact, really kind of for a long time, you were revision three, David.
[00:51:53.120 --> 00:51:54.600]   Let's face it.
[00:51:54.600 --> 00:51:57.800]   It was, I was the only full-time employee here.
[00:51:57.800 --> 00:52:03.520]   We were watching the old system where you and Kevin came up here and I was still up in
[00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:06.000]   the little tiny room just by myself.
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:07.920]   And I imagine you held the camera on that thing.
[00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:11.000]   I mean, you held the camera on that first Ignatian we were watching, I'm sure.
[00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:12.000]   Oh, wow.
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:13.600]   We did like, what was it?
[00:52:13.600 --> 00:52:14.600]   How to podcast or something?
[00:52:14.600 --> 00:52:15.600]   Yeah.
[00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:16.600]   Yeah, you remember that?
[00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:20.920]   And we said that basically like the, there's the low end solution and then there's the fancy
[00:52:20.920 --> 00:52:24.400]   high end solution, which was you had, I don't know, eight different auxiliary.
[00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:26.400]   And puts, and we're like, oh my God.
[00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:30.600]   Oh, how does he do it?
[00:52:30.600 --> 00:52:33.600]   We've gotten a little bit beyond that at this point, I have to say, and we're still
[00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:34.600]   not done.
[00:52:34.600 --> 00:52:37.960]   It's kind of fun seeing what toys we can buy.
[00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:41.720]   I have to admit, I'm already trying to figure out I'm going to be in France in December for
[00:52:41.720 --> 00:52:44.360]   a little web and I'm trying to figure out how I can broadcast.
[00:52:44.360 --> 00:52:45.360]   New web.
[00:52:45.360 --> 00:52:46.360]   Isn't that funny?
[00:52:46.360 --> 00:52:49.120]   Are you going to that as a paid speaker?
[00:52:49.120 --> 00:52:51.720]   No, you know what I found out?
[00:52:51.720 --> 00:52:53.520]   We've worked this out since.
[00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:55.520]   But I sent a note to Loeweek who throws this.
[00:52:55.520 --> 00:52:57.840]   He's the guy at Seismic and I said, okay, I'm ready to go.
[00:52:57.840 --> 00:52:59.840]   Do I buy the ticket and get reimbursed?
[00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:00.840]   Do you buy?
[00:53:00.840 --> 00:53:03.320]   And he says, no, we'll give you a small, small stipend.
[00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:04.320]   I said, well, wait a minute.
[00:53:04.320 --> 00:53:05.320]   That's not even covered the ticket.
[00:53:05.320 --> 00:53:06.320]   I can't go.
[00:53:06.320 --> 00:53:08.680]   I'm not going to pay to speak.
[00:53:08.680 --> 00:53:13.080]   So we worked it out, but no, I am not a paid speaker there.
[00:53:13.080 --> 00:53:16.000]   And you got him to fly a business class, huh?
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:17.000]   You heard about that.
[00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:18.000]   How'd you hear about that?
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:19.800]   I just made that up because I figured out was the case.
[00:53:19.800 --> 00:53:20.800]   Well, I am not going to.
[00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:21.800]   That's how you do it.
[00:53:21.800 --> 00:53:22.800]   Look at that.
[00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:23.800]   He's a journalist.
[00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:25.520]   I now have to now NDA you.
[00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:30.800]   No, I just, it was like, I'm not flying 10 hours in a little tiny seat.
[00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:32.040]   Because I'm a big guy.
[00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:33.040]   I agree with you.
[00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:36.720]   I mean, and I think it's worth it for them to have you at their conference.
[00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:39.200]   So we're going to broadcast live there.
[00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:41.720]   And now we use this live you thing, you know, that uses 3G.
[00:53:41.720 --> 00:53:44.160]   It doesn't work in Europe because it's a different frequencies.
[00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:49.160]   But I think they told me that they'll have drop shift to Paris, a live you for Paris.
[00:53:49.160 --> 00:53:50.160]   So we'll stream live.
[00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:51.440]   And Kevin's going to be there speaking.
[00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:54.560]   So I'm going to get Kevin and a bunch of other people do a, we'll do it all in French.
[00:53:54.560 --> 00:53:56.760]   It'll be so much fun.
[00:53:56.760 --> 00:53:59.680]   Mike Harrington is going to be there, but I don't know if he'll consent to be on camera
[00:53:59.680 --> 00:54:00.680]   with me anymore.
[00:54:00.680 --> 00:54:05.160]   I think I've finally cheesed him off beyond repair.
[00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:09.160]   This episode brought to you by our friends at audible.com.
[00:54:09.160 --> 00:54:12.160]   You know, Audible, that's the great place where you get audiobooks to listen to.
[00:54:12.160 --> 00:54:17.920]   Boy, when I was doing the screen savers and I had that two hour commute every day to and
[00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:22.320]   from Petaluma to San Francisco, Audible just saved my life.
[00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:24.720]   I don't, I don't think I could have survived without those great books.
[00:54:24.720 --> 00:54:26.160]   And I'm still listening to Audible books.
[00:54:26.160 --> 00:54:29.040]   The other day I was looking, they have a new Audible app for iPhone and Android.
[00:54:29.040 --> 00:54:33.880]   And I was looking at, it's cool because the app gives you all the books you've ever, that
[00:54:33.880 --> 00:54:36.000]   you own that you've ever listened to.
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:37.520]   They do it kind of, this is a nice thing.
[00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:38.680]   They do have copy protection.
[00:54:38.680 --> 00:54:42.680]   You can't sell or rent or anything, but you at least have access to that book in the
[00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:44.640]   library forever.
[00:54:44.640 --> 00:54:48.200]   So you can always go back and re-listen to a book.
[00:54:48.200 --> 00:54:49.840]   So I think this is kind of a nice compromise.
[00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:51.920]   I admit I'm not crazy about DRM.
[00:54:51.920 --> 00:54:54.320]   Publishers don't give them an option.
[00:54:54.320 --> 00:55:00.240]   I saw that you have Patrick Norton, the new William Gibson novel there in your hot little
[00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:03.520]   hands, Zero History.
[00:55:03.520 --> 00:55:04.520]   It's delightful.
[00:55:04.520 --> 00:55:08.320]   You could read it like Patrick's doing in the dead tree fashion.
[00:55:08.320 --> 00:55:11.520]   Or, and I'll own this dead tree forever.
[00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:14.240]   Well, so I, so I came listening anytime I want.
[00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:17.840]   You could listen to Robertson Dean, who's one of their best narrators.
[00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:20.760]   In fact, let me play a little bit of Zero History.
[00:55:20.760 --> 00:55:24.040]   This is the brand new, just came out three days ago.
[00:55:24.040 --> 00:55:25.920]   Steven Gibson novel.
[00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:30.480]   Cabinet's members in the performing arts were somewhat less than stellar.
[00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:34.720]   And she assumed that that suited inch male just about as well as it suited her.
[00:55:34.720 --> 00:55:37.200]   Now what's, now, what's, what's this about, Patrick?
[00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:38.200]   What's the book about?
[00:55:38.200 --> 00:55:41.200]   Oh boy, I'm just going to read the jacket flap.
[00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:42.360]   Did you just start?
[00:55:42.360 --> 00:55:43.360]   Did you just start?
[00:55:43.360 --> 00:55:44.360]   Well, basically.
[00:55:44.360 --> 00:55:45.680]   Yeah, you're just big, big beginning right there.
[00:55:45.680 --> 00:55:46.680]   Yeah, it's big.
[00:55:46.680 --> 00:55:48.680]   Yo, is it sci-fi?
[00:55:48.680 --> 00:55:50.160]   It's, it's the stuff he's been doing lately.
[00:55:50.160 --> 00:55:52.680]   Hubertis Big End is back.
[00:55:52.680 --> 00:55:55.800]   Hollis Henry worked for the global marketing magnet Hubertis Big End, who was the founder
[00:55:55.800 --> 00:55:56.800]   of Lou Ant.
[00:55:56.800 --> 00:55:57.800]   I loved it.
[00:55:57.800 --> 00:55:58.800]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:55:58.800 --> 00:55:59.800]   It's a great character or archetype.
[00:55:59.800 --> 00:56:00.800]   But she's broken.
[00:56:00.800 --> 00:56:03.800]   Big End never feels it's beneath him to use whatever power comes his way.
[00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:11.680]   So you start out in this really insane hotel in London with a cab and then mayhem is beginning
[00:56:11.680 --> 00:56:13.320]   to, to ensue.
[00:56:13.320 --> 00:56:14.320]   It's now on Audible.
[00:56:14.320 --> 00:56:15.320]   You can read it in paper.
[00:56:15.320 --> 00:56:19.600]   Sure you can, but Audible makes it so fun because they read it to you.
[00:56:19.600 --> 00:56:21.240]   You listen, you enjoy.
[00:56:21.240 --> 00:56:22.920]   It's like a movie in your mind.
[00:56:22.920 --> 00:56:24.080]   I mean, I'm not kidding.
[00:56:24.080 --> 00:56:26.440]   It plays out on my skull.
[00:56:26.440 --> 00:56:29.840]   And oftentimes I'll, I'll have listened to this book and I'll, I could swear, oh, I,
[00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:30.840]   I saw it.
[00:56:30.840 --> 00:56:32.720]   And really it was just, it was the book in your head.
[00:56:32.720 --> 00:56:38.680]   There's something about, there really is something different about listening versus reading and
[00:56:38.680 --> 00:56:40.000]   the way your brain processes it.
[00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:41.080]   And I happen to really like it.
[00:56:41.080 --> 00:56:42.600]   Now not many people don't.
[00:56:42.600 --> 00:56:45.360]   That's why we offer a free book, actually two free books.
[00:56:45.360 --> 00:56:47.600]   So you can get a sense of whether Audible is right for you.
[00:56:47.600 --> 00:56:51.720]   If you go to audible.com/twit2, you'll sign up for the platinum account.
[00:56:51.720 --> 00:56:52.820]   That's two books a month.
[00:56:52.820 --> 00:56:54.720]   That's what I have.
[00:56:54.720 --> 00:56:58.040]   And frankly, sometimes that's not even enough, but it's, but it's a good start.
[00:56:58.040 --> 00:56:59.040]   And your first two books are free.
[00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:00.040]   Your first month's free.
[00:57:00.040 --> 00:57:01.560]   You can cancel it anytime so you don't have to pay anything.
[00:57:01.560 --> 00:57:03.880]   You get to keep those books forever.
[00:57:03.880 --> 00:57:10.040]   Plays on every device, Android now, as well as all the Apple devices, as well as the Kindle,
[00:57:10.040 --> 00:57:11.360]   many GPS devices.
[00:57:11.360 --> 00:57:14.840]   There's a whole device list, hundreds of devices, or just on your computer.
[00:57:14.840 --> 00:57:16.640]   It's a great way to read.
[00:57:16.640 --> 00:57:21.160]   Read in those times when you cannot hold a book like the gym, like the commute, house
[00:57:21.160 --> 00:57:22.840]   work, walk in the dog.
[00:57:22.840 --> 00:57:24.400]   I listen every chance I get.
[00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:25.600]   I just love it.
[00:57:25.600 --> 00:57:27.400]   Audible.com/twit2.
[00:57:27.400 --> 00:57:29.440]   Try it free today.
[00:57:29.440 --> 00:57:31.640]   And this is our book of the week.
[00:57:31.640 --> 00:57:33.120]   Zero history brand new from William Gibson.
[00:57:33.120 --> 00:57:36.800]   I'm so glad you brought that in, Patrick, because that inspired me.
[00:57:36.800 --> 00:57:38.320]   And I'm going to add this to my list.
[00:57:38.320 --> 00:57:40.920]   Apparently, he was doing a signing in Berkeley yesterday.
[00:57:40.920 --> 00:57:42.840]   He was in town, and he didn't call me.
[00:57:42.840 --> 00:57:44.760]   I hate it when that happens.
[00:57:44.760 --> 00:57:45.960]   You know how these book tours are.
[00:57:45.960 --> 00:57:46.960]   Damn, that William.
[00:57:46.960 --> 00:57:47.960]   I've interviewed him.
[00:57:47.960 --> 00:57:49.200]   I have interviewed him.
[00:57:49.200 --> 00:57:50.200]   Yeah, he's great.
[00:57:50.200 --> 00:57:51.200]   Really cool.
[00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:53.520]   He's on Twitter now, and he has a strange handle.
[00:57:53.520 --> 00:57:54.520]   What is it?
[00:57:54.520 --> 00:57:55.520]   Great dismal.
[00:57:55.520 --> 00:57:56.520]   What is it?
[00:57:56.520 --> 00:57:57.520]   Great dismal.
[00:57:57.520 --> 00:57:58.520]   Yes.
[00:57:58.520 --> 00:57:59.520]   Awesome.
[00:57:59.520 --> 00:58:00.520]   Audible.com/twit2.
[00:58:00.520 --> 00:58:04.360]   Believe it or not, actually, I actually listen to audiobooks while running.
[00:58:04.360 --> 00:58:05.360]   Yes.
[00:58:05.360 --> 00:58:06.360]   Like, no, what's--
[00:58:06.360 --> 00:58:07.360]   That's what I'll--
[00:58:07.360 --> 00:58:09.080]   I've been training for this marathon that I'm doing.
[00:58:09.080 --> 00:58:14.760]   So increasingly, these runs last for well over an hour, and I need to, like, engage
[00:58:14.760 --> 00:58:15.760]   myself while doing it.
[00:58:15.760 --> 00:58:16.760]   Yes.
[00:58:16.760 --> 00:58:20.120]   And then you'll find yourself able to run further because you're so engaged in the story that
[00:58:20.120 --> 00:58:22.040]   you want to keep running to keep listening to it.
[00:58:22.040 --> 00:58:23.040]   Sure.
[00:58:23.040 --> 00:58:24.040]   Just kind of funny.
[00:58:24.040 --> 00:58:25.040]   No, it's great.
[00:58:25.040 --> 00:58:27.480]   I mean, I-- you know, sometimes I'll sit in the driveway with a motor running because
[00:58:27.480 --> 00:58:29.000]   I don't want to stop yet.
[00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:31.320]   I love to turn it to the accessories and just turn off.
[00:58:31.320 --> 00:58:32.320]   Yeah, I do that.
[00:58:32.320 --> 00:58:33.320]   I do that.
[00:58:33.320 --> 00:58:35.600]   They're saying, "John, come back, John.
[00:58:35.600 --> 00:58:36.600]   Come back, John."
[00:58:36.600 --> 00:58:37.840]   With the chat room?
[00:58:37.840 --> 00:58:38.840]   Yeah.
[00:58:38.840 --> 00:58:39.840]   Thank you, John.
[00:58:39.840 --> 00:58:42.760]   They-- they-- they goed me.
[00:58:42.760 --> 00:58:43.760]   You're beloved.
[00:58:43.760 --> 00:58:46.200]   By the way, William Gibson does tweet a lot.
[00:58:46.200 --> 00:58:48.960]   I'm kind of thrilled that he tweets so much.
[00:58:48.960 --> 00:58:49.960]   Yeah.
[00:58:49.960 --> 00:58:51.760]   And it's-- and you know what?
[00:58:51.760 --> 00:58:52.760]   The content is good.
[00:58:52.760 --> 00:58:53.760]   What is it again?
[00:58:53.760 --> 00:58:56.640]   Twitter.com/greatdismall.
[00:58:56.640 --> 00:58:57.640]   What is that?
[00:58:57.640 --> 00:58:58.640]   What is that from?
[00:58:58.640 --> 00:58:59.640]   Great Dismall.
[00:58:59.640 --> 00:59:00.640]   I've yet to figure it out.
[00:59:00.640 --> 00:59:04.200]   Is it something in-- it sounds like something in the "Quick Silver" saga, maybe here.
[00:59:04.200 --> 00:59:05.880]   His most recent tweet.
[00:59:05.880 --> 00:59:07.800]   There's a great dismal swan.
[00:59:07.800 --> 00:59:14.400]   "Vin and now, promiscuous but very good-hearted Bohemian aunt, rediscovered working for high-end
[00:59:14.400 --> 00:59:16.320]   escort service."
[00:59:16.320 --> 00:59:17.320]   No idea what that means.
[00:59:17.320 --> 00:59:20.520]   I think he was saying at the Chateau Marmont for these--
[00:59:20.520 --> 00:59:21.680]   Oh, "Vin and now."
[00:59:21.680 --> 00:59:28.880]   Oh, so the Chateau Marmont before was a promiscuous but very good-hearted Bohemian aunt.
[00:59:28.880 --> 00:59:31.280]   Now, she's working for a high-end escorts.
[00:59:31.280 --> 00:59:32.680]   I still don't know what that means.
[00:59:32.680 --> 00:59:35.840]   It's basically saying like it's just gotten even weirder.
[00:59:35.840 --> 00:59:36.840]   Weirder and weirder.
[00:59:36.840 --> 00:59:37.760]   Yeah.
[00:59:37.760 --> 00:59:38.760]   He's looking fundamentally untrustworthy.
[00:59:38.760 --> 00:59:41.280]   I think he just likes words.
[00:59:41.280 --> 00:59:43.280]   "Lemonally velour robe."
[00:59:43.280 --> 00:59:47.120]   It's almost like a velour robe is a type of human being.
[00:59:47.120 --> 00:59:51.720]   It's kind of a non-nice description of a human being.
[00:59:51.720 --> 00:59:52.720]   Really?
[00:59:52.720 --> 00:59:53.720]   Used in zero history.
[00:59:53.720 --> 00:59:59.440]   See, I need Patrick to gloss his tweets.
[00:59:59.440 --> 01:00:00.560]   He does wear those shoes though.
[01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:02.640]   The shoes that are on his Twitter.
[01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:03.640]   Those are-- that's his feet.
[01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:04.640]   I've seen those shoes.
[01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:05.640]   Yeah.
[01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:06.640]   Well, he's--
[01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:07.640]   He's just kidding.
[01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:08.640]   But the stuff.
[01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:15.480]   Buzz Rixens, who was the maker of these sort of mythical Japanese remakes of classic American
[01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:18.680]   pieces of clothing, military clothes, and it's actually a real company.
[01:00:18.680 --> 01:00:19.680]   Oh, me?
[01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:24.840]   And they make ridiculous, like, historical remakes of classic pieces of mostly military.
[01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:30.040]   When I was-- when we were at Maker Fair in Detroit, Ford brought us out there, and
[01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:31.280]   Utila Kiltz was there.
[01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:32.280]   Nice.
[01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:34.200]   And I said-- I don't know.
[01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:35.360]   I said Patrick Norton says hi.
[01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:36.440]   They said who.
[01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:38.440]   But the thought was there.
[01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:41.040]   Nobody there is too many more.
[01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:43.360]   Nobody you know is there anymore.
[01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:44.360]   But the thought was there.
[01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:46.320]   There was also a woman there selling gag balls.
[01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:48.000]   I don't know if that's related.
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:49.000]   What?
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:50.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:51.000]   I woke up.
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000]   You always know what I'm talking about.
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.000]   I woke up.
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:55.000]   I woke up.
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.000]   Quick, go to--
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:57.000]   Watch.
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:58.000]   Watch.
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:00:59.000]   What?
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:00.000]   Search.
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.000]   What?
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:02.000]   Gags balls.
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:03.640]   Never mind.
[01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:05.400]   Unleash the gimp.
[01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:06.400]   Forget I said anything.
[01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:08.400]   Ducks locked into a bar.
[01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:09.640]   Stop it.
[01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:13.640]   Lady, Indians ride bearback.
[01:01:13.640 --> 01:01:16.920]   Moving right along.
[01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:17.720]   See, that's one way to--
[01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:18.720]   A classic.
[01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:19.720]   A classic.
[01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:22.360]   A joke in a really long time.
[01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:23.520]   You like that.
[01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:32.600]   Google says 80,000 apps are in the Android marketplace.
[01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:35.680]   They said there were some interesting numbers from the Google search event where they announced
[01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:36.680]   Google Instant.
[01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:38.360]   They said this was, I thought, interesting.
[01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:41.840]   One billion people every week use Google services.
[01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:44.640]   I think this was kind of a response to the Facebook half billion, right?
[01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:45.640]   Half billion a month.
[01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:46.640]   That's nothing.
[01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:48.200]   We got a billion a week.
[01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:52.880]   They also said-- I thought this was kind of surprising that 20% of all searches, one
[01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:57.720]   in five, they had never seen before.
[01:01:57.720 --> 01:01:59.520]   They had never seen before.
[01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:03.520]   That's important for Google because they cash a lot of searches.
[01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:05.800]   They have no cash.
[01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:06.800]   There's no record of.
[01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:09.160]   They have to start all over and go through their index with--
[01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:11.440]   Let me search for something that I haven't searched for before.
[01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:13.440]   How about Limannly-Vallure-Robe?
[01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:14.440]   Lemon-ly.
[01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:17.600]   Can you even spell it?
[01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:19.280]   I don't know what you'd get.
[01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:20.280]   But there's an example.
[01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:22.080]   You could say things that--
[01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:27.080]   Well, you get William Gibson and Valour Bathrobe at Amazon.
[01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:31.200]   I get roads and accessories that tournament concepts--
[01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:32.200]   Oh, Victoria's secrets?
[01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:33.200]   All right.
[01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:34.200]   All right.
[01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:35.200]   Stop it.
[01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:36.200]   Stop it.
[01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:37.680]   I think Google instant though is going to make people better searchers who probably
[01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:42.760]   weren't probably decent searchers to begin with just for the fact that by maybe changing
[01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:46.760]   keywords as you're typing them in and getting a feel for how to create a good search to
[01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:50.520]   begin with, I think just having that instant feedback makes a big difference.
[01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:57.200]   I think that's Google's idea actually is to kind of lead you down the path of proper
[01:02:57.200 --> 01:03:00.000]   search as opposed to the stupid stuff you've been typing in.
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:01.000]   You know what?
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:02.840]   And to distract the crap out of you.
[01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:03.840]   That's not--
[01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:04.840]   You might think that's what it is.
[01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:05.840]   I think that's what it is.
[01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:06.840]   I think Riker's right.
[01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:07.840]   That was awesome.
[01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:10.840]   You completely canceled each other out.
[01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:12.840]   It was like a wave.
[01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:13.840]   Riker's right.
[01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:15.640]   Riker, tell them what you think.
[01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:19.560]   I think that you know exactly what you want to find because you're an experienced computer
[01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:24.280]   user and an experienced syntax user of Google and you start typing something in the auto
[01:03:24.280 --> 01:03:28.960]   searches for other stuff and distracts you by enticing you to read other things that
[01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:30.280]   you don't want to read.
[01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:34.600]   But since we all have ADD, it's going to take us away from what they want to do and make
[01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:35.760]   us less productive.
[01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:37.760]   Is this good for Google Y?
[01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:41.320]   I think it's the some more ads.
[01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:42.320]   True.
[01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:45.920]   I just close my eyes while I'm typing in my search stuff now.
[01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:47.160]   I'm a huge fan of Chrome though.
[01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:48.720]   I like having a single bar at the top.
[01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:50.120]   I don't understand why you haven't used it.
[01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:53.880]   That's my question is why-- who even uses Google.com anymore?
[01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:54.880]   Does anybody?
[01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:56.600]   When I'm not using Chrome, I do.
[01:03:56.600 --> 01:03:59.160]   If you're using Firefox, you have that little box.
[01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:00.920]   If you're using Internet Explorer, you have that little box.
[01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:04.600]   If you're using Safari, you have that little box in Chrome, you just use the URL window.
[01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:05.600]   It's just a habit.
[01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:06.760]   So you go to Google.com?
[01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:09.600]   Not all the time, but I just do it automatically.
[01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:10.600]   It's just a habitual.
[01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:13.360]   I've done it for so long that I automatically do it.
[01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:14.680]   Yeah, I'll even do it in Chrome.
[01:04:14.680 --> 01:04:16.840]   It's retarded, but--
[01:04:16.840 --> 01:04:17.840]   Aha.
[01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:19.920]   Yoshi, what do you use?
[01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:20.920]   You're a professional.
[01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:26.520]   I use Chrome, but honestly, and I used a little bar from my search stuff.
[01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:29.080]   I set Google for my home page for some reason.
[01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:30.200]   Oh, so what's your home page?
[01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:31.200]   OK, that's interesting.
[01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:32.800]   But I don't use it for the search.
[01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:35.520]   I go up and click on the bar.
[01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:38.800]   Well, that's one of the things I really like about Chrome is that you just don't make
[01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:40.560]   a distinction.
[01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:42.920]   It didn't-- was Firefox invented this?
[01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:46.800]   They called it the Any-- what did it-- Anywhere Everywhere bar or something like that, the
[01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:51.320]   magical-- so how many chat room-- let me ask the chat room.
[01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:56.240]   How many of you in the chat room use the Google front page?
[01:04:56.240 --> 01:05:00.240]   Let me just see, because this is-- it's been my contention that I never use the awesome
[01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:01.240]   bar.
[01:05:01.240 --> 01:05:02.240]   Thank you.
[01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:04.720]   That I never use it from a page, but I'm surprisingly large number of people.
[01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:07.120]   Well, now I can't make header tails of what I'm seeing.
[01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:11.800]   I'm seeing a lot of-- I don't know what that-- yeah, who's the-- nobody asked him on
[01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:15.520]   him and he'll have a-- no, no, no, no, no, yes, no, no, yes, no, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes,
[01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:20.960]   no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:27.960]   no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

[01:09:36.960 --> 01:10:06.960]   no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
[01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:36.960]   no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
[01:10:36.960 --> 01:11:06.960]   no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
[01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:36.960]   no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
[01:11:36.960 --> 01:12:06.960]   no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
[01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:08.960]   because it depends.
[01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:09.960]   (laughs)
[01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:10.960]   It depends on how much of a hurry you're in.
[01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:12.960]   I'm not backing you up at all today, or something.
[01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:15.960]   No, well, I think John, perhaps, when you had to write a column a day,
[01:12:15.960 --> 01:12:18.960]   you might have been glad to take the obvious cliche, but I...
[01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:20.960]   No, actually, you don't pay any attention to that at all.
[01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:23.960]   You just put everything down, and then you kill that stuff at the beginning,
[01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:26.960]   which is usually garbage, and you find your real lead downs further.
[01:12:26.960 --> 01:12:28.960]   So, Google scribe, if you look closely...
[01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:30.960]   You took the years to realize that.
[01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:32.960]   Yeah, you spit it out, and then you fix it.
[01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:33.960]   You're right.
[01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:34.960]   Yeah, no, that's the way to write.
[01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:36.960]   So, this is Google scribe.
[01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:37.960]   It'll work.
[01:12:37.960 --> 01:12:39.960]   You can actually put a bookmarklet in your browser in any text field.
[01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:40.960]   It'll work.
[01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:43.960]   It suggests, it uses the same technology as Google Instant,
[01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:45.960]   and it suggests the next phrase as you start typing.
[01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:49.960]   So, I just typed, "We didn't star," and then, look, number three, start the fire.
[01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:52.960]   I just pressed three, and it finishes my sentence.
[01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:53.960]   Huh.
[01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:55.960]   This is...
[01:12:55.960 --> 01:12:57.960]   Now, the problem is, of course, you're going to get cliches,
[01:12:57.960 --> 01:13:00.960]   because the suggestions are what people type the most, right?
[01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:02.960]   So, give me a phrase.
[01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:03.960]   How about let this...
[01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:04.960]   One in the hand...
[01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:05.960]   Is...
[01:13:05.960 --> 01:13:06.960]   Four score and seven.
[01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:07.960]   Oh, yeah, let's try four.
[01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:09.960]   Let's see what would have done with the link, the Gettysburg Address.
[01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:11.960]   Four score and...
[01:13:11.960 --> 01:13:12.960]   Oh, yeah.
[01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:13.960]   It's already got it.
[01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:14.960]   Yeah, it's got it.
[01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:15.960]   It's got it.
[01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:16.960]   Years...
[01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:17.960]   Oh, it knows.
[01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:18.960]   A go.
[01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:19.960]   Three.
[01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:20.960]   Go your criminal.
[01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:21.960]   You start just making mess out of it.
[01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:22.960]   See what you can come up with.
[01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:23.960]   [Laughter]
[01:13:23.960 --> 01:13:24.960]   Uh...
[01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:25.960]   What?
[01:13:25.960 --> 01:13:27.960]   You're a criminal.
[01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:28.960]   You're...
[01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:29.960]   You could.
[01:13:29.960 --> 01:13:30.960]   You would just click a...
[01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:32.960]   Yeah, you rock star.
[01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:33.960]   Okay.
[01:13:33.960 --> 01:13:35.960]   Four score and seven years ago, you're a rock star.
[01:13:35.960 --> 01:13:36.960]   And what?
[01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:37.960]   Now what?
[01:13:37.960 --> 01:13:38.960]   And...
[01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:39.960]   Okay, I'll take that.
[01:13:39.960 --> 01:13:40.960]   Dog.
[01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:41.960]   The dog.
[01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:42.960]   Was.
[01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:44.960]   Well, doggy ribbed.
[01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:45.960]   Ribbed.
[01:13:45.960 --> 01:13:46.960]   My...
[01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:47.960]   It doesn't deal with the...
[01:13:47.960 --> 01:13:48.960]   Volour.
[01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:49.960]   It doesn't play that much.
[01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:50.960]   This is a song lyric generator.
[01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:51.960]   I figured it out.
[01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:57.960]   Volour, see the pulse tree with a gigantic...
[01:13:57.960 --> 01:13:59.960]   Oh, it doesn't like...
[01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:00.960]   I'm gonna spit.
[01:14:00.960 --> 01:14:02.960]   It should be better if it was cranking out poetry.
[01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:03.960]   Whirlpool.
[01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:06.960]   Oh, I was thinking of something else.
[01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:07.960]   The...
[01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:08.960]   Lady...
[01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:10.960]   Said...
[01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:16.960]   So basically you're saying you've turned the entire Internet and the largest and most powerful group of servers in the planet...
[01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:17.960]   Yeah.
[01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:18.960]   ...into a giant mad lib sub-subs.
[01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:19.960]   Yes.
[01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:20.960]   [Laughter]
[01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:23.960]   Anyway, that's Google's scribe.
[01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:28.960]   Thank you, Google, for a very wonderful, useful technology, which, again, no one will ever use again.
[01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:31.960]   So, wait a minute, if I took a bunch of chimps and I put them at a keyboard,
[01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:33.960]   well, they eventually just come across like...
[01:14:33.960 --> 01:14:35.960]   Just to, again, on a Google will buy it.
[01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:38.960]   Actually, now that's true, now that chimps can write everything.
[01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:39.960]   They can.
[01:14:39.960 --> 01:14:41.960]   They got all the cliches in the world.
[01:14:41.960 --> 01:14:42.960]   Yo, she did that old phrase.
[01:14:42.960 --> 01:14:46.960]   You know, if you had an infinite number of monkeys that would write all the world's great books.
[01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:50.960]   At an infinite number of typewriters, writing for an infinite length of time.
[01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:51.960]   Yeah.
[01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:52.960]   You gotta have all three.
[01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:53.960]   Well.
[01:14:53.960 --> 01:14:54.960]   Said infinite length of time and that infinite...
[01:14:54.960 --> 01:14:57.960]   I figured they'd get the job done before the infinity ended.
[01:14:57.960 --> 01:15:00.960]   Well, you might get some of Shakespeare.
[01:15:00.960 --> 01:15:02.960]   But would you get all of Shakespeare?
[01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:03.960]   No.
[01:15:03.960 --> 01:15:05.960]   Yo, she... are you okay there?
[01:15:05.960 --> 01:15:06.960]   Yeah.
[01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:07.960]   Didn't pass out.
[01:15:07.960 --> 01:15:09.960]   No, didn't pass out.
[01:15:09.960 --> 01:15:10.960]   Okay.
[01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:12.960]   Let's move along.
[01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:14.960]   If we've done the Google thing, I think we've done everything.
[01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:15.960]   We talked about instant searches.
[01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:17.960]   Is there anything else to say about it?
[01:15:17.960 --> 01:15:18.960]   Are we excited about it?
[01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:20.960]   Is this a wonderful change?
[01:15:20.960 --> 01:15:23.960]   We're still waiting for Google music and Google TV to come out.
[01:15:23.960 --> 01:15:27.960]   Is Google TV now that Apple kind of punted on Apple TV?
[01:15:27.960 --> 01:15:29.960]   Is Google TV gonna be great?
[01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:30.960]   Gonna suck?
[01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:32.960]   Robert, this is your... this is your bailiwick.
[01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:34.960]   You and Patrick do HD Nation.
[01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:35.960]   Yeah.
[01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:37.960]   Are you gonna run out and get a pie of hopes for...
[01:15:37.960 --> 01:15:39.960]   Tell me about it.
[01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:40.960]   Why?
[01:15:40.960 --> 01:15:41.960]   Uh oh, we lost your audio.
[01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:42.960]   Hello?
[01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:43.960]   Oh.
[01:15:43.960 --> 01:15:44.960]   There.
[01:15:44.960 --> 01:15:45.960]   You're sitting on a mute button.
[01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:46.960]   Robert, look at that.
[01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:47.960]   He's just talking.
[01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:49.960]   He's like the Google scribe of show hosts.
[01:15:49.960 --> 01:15:50.960]   Hey, Robert.
[01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:51.960]   Robert.
[01:15:51.960 --> 01:15:52.960]   He's getting such a good information.
[01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:53.960]   He's just talking.
[01:15:53.960 --> 01:15:56.960]   Robert, he's probably spitting out the bird.
[01:15:56.960 --> 01:15:58.960]   Robert, we don't hear you.
[01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:01.960]   Hey, can someone type in the sky if it's saying that?
[01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:02.960]   He's just talking.
[01:16:02.960 --> 01:16:03.960]   It's good.
[01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:04.960]   You know, whatever he's saying, I'm sure it's...
[01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:05.960]   You know, no, no, no.
[01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:08.960]   What we do is you leave it up and then we talk underneath it.
[01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:09.960]   Okay.
[01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:10.960]   So let's say, okay.
[01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:16.960]   So then what I think is that Google scribe that merged with Google TV is gonna give us a whole new paradigm for a girl.
[01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:17.960]   You go by sister.
[01:16:17.960 --> 01:16:19.960]   My name is...
[01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:20.960]   You know something's up.
[01:16:20.960 --> 01:16:21.960]   He figured it out.
[01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:22.960]   Oh, no.
[01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:24.960]   My name is Ego Montoya.
[01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:26.960]   We have a problem.
[01:16:26.960 --> 01:16:28.960]   Was he the guy who liked the Princess Bride?
[01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:29.960]   No, that was me.
[01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:30.960]   I was.
[01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:31.960]   Okay.
[01:16:31.960 --> 01:16:32.960]   Robert, can you hear us?
[01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:33.960]   Savages.
[01:16:33.960 --> 01:16:34.960]   Oh!
[01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:35.960]   Oh!
[01:16:35.960 --> 01:16:37.960]   He got mad.
[01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:39.960]   He got Manny hung up.
[01:16:39.960 --> 01:16:41.960]   For all the people just listening to the whole thing.
[01:16:41.960 --> 01:16:43.960]   Don't make fun because of like Princess Bro.
[01:16:43.960 --> 01:16:44.960]   What?
[01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:45.960]   Yeah, what did that sound like, Yoshi?
[01:16:45.960 --> 01:16:46.960]   Because you couldn't see anything.
[01:16:46.960 --> 01:16:48.960]   What did it sound like me laughing?
[01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:50.960]   It just sounded weird, right?
[01:16:50.960 --> 01:16:51.960]   It was weirdness.
[01:16:51.960 --> 01:16:53.960]   Just strange stuff.
[01:16:53.960 --> 01:16:55.960]   Let's see.
[01:16:55.960 --> 01:17:04.960]   Google's founder, Sergey Brin, said, "We want to be the third half of your brain."
[01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:05.960]   No.
[01:17:05.960 --> 01:17:07.960]   There's no such thing as a third of a half.
[01:17:07.960 --> 01:17:08.960]   Really?
[01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:10.960]   There's such thing as a third of a half.
[01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:12.960]   There's no such thing as a third half.
[01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:14.960]   No, a third half.
[01:17:14.960 --> 01:17:15.960]   You are correct.
[01:17:15.960 --> 01:17:19.960]   We want to be the third half of your brain.
[01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:21.960]   We don't want to be a third of the half of your brain.
[01:17:21.960 --> 01:17:23.960]   We want to be the third half of your brain.
[01:17:23.960 --> 01:17:25.960]   So, so, being a sixth.
[01:17:25.960 --> 01:17:30.960]   And then Eric Schmidt says, "We want to know what you're searching for before you search for it."
[01:17:30.960 --> 01:17:33.960]   Does this worry anybody?
[01:17:33.960 --> 01:17:36.960]   Why don't they just live my life for me then?
[01:17:36.960 --> 01:17:38.960]   I think this is the whole idea of Google.
[01:17:38.960 --> 01:17:39.960]   They will.
[01:17:39.960 --> 01:17:40.960]   They're shortly.
[01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:42.960]   Let's never version out unified string theory apparently.
[01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:44.960]   Robert, do we have audio?
[01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:46.960]   Can you hear anything?
[01:17:46.960 --> 01:17:48.960]   Earth, the Heron.
[01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:49.960]   He's pressed the mute button.
[01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:50.960]   You know that's what's going on.
[01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:51.960]   He's just puzzled by the whole thing.
[01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:52.960]   Can we type them?
[01:17:52.960 --> 01:17:53.960]   Can we type them?
[01:17:53.960 --> 01:17:54.960]   I'm going to get my settings.
[01:17:54.960 --> 01:17:55.960]   There, you're good.
[01:17:55.960 --> 01:17:56.960]   You're good.
[01:17:56.960 --> 01:17:57.960]   Don't change you.
[01:17:57.960 --> 01:17:58.960]   You probably sat on the mute button.
[01:17:58.960 --> 01:18:01.960]   Did one of the dogs eat something on your keyboard?
[01:18:01.960 --> 01:18:05.960]   Everything going from working just perfectly to just not working at all.
[01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:07.960]   So, let's go back to...
[01:18:07.960 --> 01:18:08.960]   Oh, my mic is on.
[01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:09.960]   That's for sure.
[01:18:09.960 --> 01:18:10.960]   Yeah.
[01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:11.960]   Can you hear us?
[01:18:11.960 --> 01:18:12.960]   Can I read something real quick?
[01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:13.960]   Yeah, go ahead, Joe.
[01:18:13.960 --> 01:18:14.960]   Give me a second here.
[01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:16.960]   I just wanted you to tell me what I'm reading.
[01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:22.960]   When a young boy falls ill, his grandfather pops around to visit him to cheer his grandson
[01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:30.360]   up, Grandpa has bought a storybook, The Princess Bride, a tale of the love between the beautiful
[01:18:30.360 --> 01:18:32.960]   buttercup and the besotted Wesley.
[01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:40.960]   I love cruelly interrupted by Wesley's tragic apparent death at sea when seeking his foreboding.
[01:18:40.960 --> 01:18:42.960]   First of all, the book is not the movie.
[01:18:42.960 --> 01:18:44.960]   Second of all, dude, let it go.
[01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:46.960]   I think that's like the I am to be...
[01:18:46.960 --> 01:18:47.960]   We all know the big...
[01:18:47.960 --> 01:18:48.960]   This is the synopsis from the love to me.
[01:18:48.960 --> 01:18:51.960]   You would you didn't cry when old Yeller died.
[01:18:51.960 --> 01:18:52.960]   You don't be that John.
[01:18:52.960 --> 01:18:56.960]   You know what's funny is John DeVoir could be given a free one week vacation to the Disney
[01:18:56.960 --> 01:18:58.960]   world that he'd still crap on it.
[01:18:58.960 --> 01:19:00.960]   Episode one is your favorite Star Wars movie.
[01:19:00.960 --> 01:19:01.960]   Yes, you would.
[01:19:01.960 --> 01:19:02.960]   Say it, John.
[01:19:02.960 --> 01:19:04.960]   Don't think you could pass her stones.
[01:19:04.960 --> 01:19:05.960]   Ha ha!
[01:19:05.960 --> 01:19:06.960]   Dones!
[01:19:06.960 --> 01:19:07.960]   Oh, no!
[01:19:07.960 --> 01:19:08.960]   I'm...
[01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:09.960]   I'm taking...
[01:19:09.960 --> 01:19:10.960]   Shaking to the bone.
[01:19:10.960 --> 01:19:11.960]   The only thing you can...
[01:19:11.960 --> 01:19:13.960]   Where did you get that?
[01:19:13.960 --> 01:19:14.960]   I don't know.
[01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:15.960]   Why did you get that?
[01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:16.960]   You stole it from someone.
[01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:17.960]   That's...
[01:19:17.960 --> 01:19:18.960]   Oh yeah, because I get bigger.
[01:19:18.960 --> 01:19:19.960]   It's just bigger.
[01:19:19.960 --> 01:19:22.960]   It's like something cranky geeks on Wednesday.
[01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:24.960]   Ah, finally, it happens.
[01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:25.960]   Can I, Patrick?
[01:19:25.960 --> 01:19:26.960]   Absolutely.
[01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:28.960]   Patrick says it's okay.
[01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:31.960]   You know, when you were doing two shows, we have to...
[01:19:31.960 --> 01:19:32.960]   Two!
[01:19:32.960 --> 01:19:34.960]   No, I don't want you to do it two shows.
[01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:35.960]   I just want you to do one.
[01:19:35.960 --> 01:19:38.960]   All right, we're gonna take a break and maybe Robert will figure it out.
[01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:39.960]   Robert, are you there?
[01:19:39.960 --> 01:19:40.960]   Can you hear me?
[01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:41.960]   No, I can't.
[01:19:41.960 --> 01:19:43.960]   I can't hug again.
[01:19:43.960 --> 01:19:45.960]   Yoshi, how you doing?
[01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:47.960]   We're running crap out.
[01:19:47.960 --> 01:19:48.960]   I'm doing good.
[01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:49.960]   Okay, it's checking.
[01:19:49.960 --> 01:19:50.960]   Everybody go get coffee.
[01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:52.960]   You can have a break now.
[01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:53.960]   This is it.
[01:19:53.960 --> 01:19:54.960]   We got some great coffee.
[01:19:54.960 --> 01:19:56.960]   Get some coffee from Mr. Norton there.
[01:19:56.960 --> 01:19:59.960]   We have the aerobic aero press.
[01:19:59.960 --> 01:20:01.960]   It's from the same people who make the Frisbee.
[01:20:01.960 --> 01:20:03.960]   It's a press thing that you...
[01:20:03.960 --> 01:20:04.960]   It's a pleasure.
[01:20:04.960 --> 01:20:05.960]   Is it like a French press?
[01:20:05.960 --> 01:20:09.960]   No, because it has a filter and it's plunging under high pressure.
[01:20:09.960 --> 01:20:12.960]   It's like something Yoshi would have made, but it makes great coffee.
[01:20:12.960 --> 01:20:14.960]   I mean, it's incredible coffee.
[01:20:14.960 --> 01:20:16.960]   How's it not a cappuccino machine?
[01:20:16.960 --> 01:20:17.960]   Because it's not a bit...
[01:20:17.960 --> 01:20:19.960]   John, what is this shot?
[01:20:19.960 --> 01:20:21.960]   John's putting up a piece of paper.
[01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:22.960]   There he is, okay.
[01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:24.960]   He just wanted to give you a good white balance.
[01:20:24.960 --> 01:20:25.960]   He's going on vacation.
[01:20:25.960 --> 01:20:26.960]   I was just gonna take a break.
[01:20:26.960 --> 01:20:29.960]   I just feel like when John does that, I feel like he's taking off his clothes and
[01:20:29.960 --> 01:20:32.960]   dancing around naked and he just doesn't want to see it.
[01:20:32.960 --> 01:20:33.960]   You wish, Leo, you wish.
[01:20:33.960 --> 01:20:34.960]   I would love to see that.
[01:20:34.960 --> 01:20:35.960]   So here it is.
[01:20:35.960 --> 01:20:36.960]   This is the aerobic aero press.
[01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:37.960]   It looks like the top of a Cuisinart.
[01:20:37.960 --> 01:20:39.960]   This is pretty edited out of the show.
[01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:40.960]   Never.
[01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:42.960]   We've decided no longer to edit the show.
[01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:44.960]   Let's see it again.
[01:20:44.960 --> 01:20:46.960]   Okay, so here it is.
[01:20:46.960 --> 01:20:47.960]   So it's three parts.
[01:20:47.960 --> 01:20:48.960]   It's very simple.
[01:20:48.960 --> 01:20:52.960]   The only thing negative is plastic, although if you go to the coffee forums...
[01:20:52.960 --> 01:20:54.960]   Here I am, the bouncing ball.
[01:20:54.960 --> 01:20:59.960]   There's people who make stainless steel ones of these with compressors and stuff.
[01:20:59.960 --> 01:21:00.960]   So it's very simple.
[01:21:00.960 --> 01:21:03.960]   There's a white paper filter that goes in there.
[01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:04.960]   Seals up that up.
[01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:05.960]   You fill this up with actually...
[01:21:05.960 --> 01:21:06.960]   You follow me camera guy?
[01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:07.960]   It's from Germany.
[01:21:07.960 --> 01:21:09.960]   So you know it's great, John.
[01:21:09.960 --> 01:21:12.960]   And you fill this up with a lot of coffee.
[01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:14.960]   Actually four tablespoons of coffee.
[01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:17.960]   And then you fill it up with water at 175 degrees.
[01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:20.960]   Not boiling because that makes a coffee beetle.
[01:21:20.960 --> 01:21:22.960]   Is it plexigast or is it just...
[01:21:22.960 --> 01:21:23.960]   No, it's plastic.
[01:21:23.960 --> 01:21:24.960]   It should be plexigast.
[01:21:24.960 --> 01:21:27.960]   Well, I'm just wondering, how are you going to pour 104 degrees worth of...
[01:21:27.960 --> 01:21:28.960]   175 degrees of water.
[01:21:28.960 --> 01:21:29.960]   Is it burning yourself?
[01:21:29.960 --> 01:21:30.960]   No, it's got a funnel.
[01:21:30.960 --> 01:21:32.960]   But we just actually put it under the thing.
[01:21:32.960 --> 01:21:33.960]   And then here.
[01:21:33.960 --> 01:21:34.960]   This is how.
[01:21:34.960 --> 01:21:35.960]   You've got to put it under the water.
[01:21:35.960 --> 01:21:36.960]   This is how.
[01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:37.960]   You got me camera guy?
[01:21:37.960 --> 01:21:38.960]   You're following me?
[01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:39.960]   Okay.
[01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:40.960]   So you pour it in there.
[01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:41.960]   Okay.
[01:21:41.960 --> 01:21:43.960]   It's got a little stirrer.
[01:21:43.960 --> 01:21:45.960]   It stirs it up.
[01:21:45.960 --> 01:21:46.960]   Ten seconds.
[01:21:46.960 --> 01:21:47.960]   And then you plunge.
[01:21:47.960 --> 01:21:48.960]   Now this is a pretty good seal.
[01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:50.960]   So you're getting a lot of PSIs in there.
[01:21:50.960 --> 01:21:52.960]   And you plunge through the coffee.
[01:21:52.960 --> 01:21:54.960]   It sounds like you're going to burn yourself accidentally.
[01:21:54.960 --> 01:21:57.960]   You know what's craziest thing I've ever seen?
[01:21:57.960 --> 01:21:59.960]   It makes the best cup of coffee you've ever had.
[01:21:59.960 --> 01:22:00.960]   I'm not kidding.
[01:22:00.960 --> 01:22:01.960]   Pasha!
[01:22:01.960 --> 01:22:02.960]   Pasha!
[01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:04.960]   Come on over and I'll make you a cup of coffee.
[01:22:04.960 --> 01:22:05.960]   Watch Patrick's here.
[01:22:05.960 --> 01:22:08.960]   Hey, hey, hey, hey, Patrick's a coffee connoisseur.
[01:22:08.960 --> 01:22:11.960]   Would you make him a cup of the best coffee he's ever had?
[01:22:11.960 --> 01:22:12.960]   He drinks it black though.
[01:22:12.960 --> 01:22:13.960]   Actually, you know when it's assembled off that.
[01:22:13.960 --> 01:22:15.960]   It looks like a specimen collector.
[01:22:15.960 --> 01:22:19.960]   I'd like to talk about squarespace.com if you don't mind.
[01:22:19.960 --> 01:22:20.960]   Go ahead.
[01:22:20.960 --> 01:22:24.960]   You may continue to take a break folks because this is the time where we do ads.
[01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:27.960]   And as everyone knows, nobody listens to the ads.
[01:22:27.960 --> 01:22:28.960]   That's not true.
[01:22:28.960 --> 01:22:30.960]   No, it's not true.
[01:22:30.960 --> 01:22:33.960]   In fact, one of the reasons people advertise on this show is because we do the ads.
[01:22:33.960 --> 01:22:37.960]   And such an engaging fashion that nobody skips through them.
[01:22:37.960 --> 01:22:42.960]   That people love them because they're afraid they might miss a bomo, something from Roger
[01:22:42.960 --> 01:22:45.960]   that just makes you howl with laughter.
[01:22:45.960 --> 01:22:47.960]   So Roger, if you get a chance, just, you know, anything.
[01:22:47.960 --> 01:22:48.960]   Howl?
[01:22:48.960 --> 01:22:49.960]   Yeah, something about it.
[01:22:49.960 --> 01:22:51.960]   The last thing he passed was a stone or something would be great.
[01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:54.960]   Oh, I just say he could pass a stone.
[01:22:54.960 --> 01:22:55.960]   Right now.
[01:22:55.960 --> 01:22:56.960]   Wow.
[01:22:56.960 --> 01:22:57.960]   Pasha!
[01:22:57.960 --> 01:22:58.960]   Squarespace.com, the secret behind exceptional websites.
[01:22:58.960 --> 01:22:59.960]   I know Kevin's using it.
[01:22:59.960 --> 01:23:00.960]   Sarah's using it.
[01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:05.960]   We use it for our behind the scenes blog inside.twit.tv.
[01:23:05.960 --> 01:23:12.960]   It is a really, now the thing I like about this is hosting plus very sophisticated software
[01:23:12.960 --> 01:23:15.960]   that makes it easy to make a site that is unique, that is beautiful.
[01:23:15.960 --> 01:23:20.960]   All you have to do is go to the examples page to get an idea of the variety of incredible
[01:23:20.960 --> 01:23:21.960]   sites.
[01:23:21.960 --> 01:23:23.960]   All of these are Squarespace sites.
[01:23:23.960 --> 01:23:24.960]   None of them look alike.
[01:23:24.960 --> 01:23:26.960]   That looks like a very simple, basic site.
[01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:31.960]   Go back here to you, Don Imus' site looks like a country in western star.
[01:23:31.960 --> 01:23:36.960]   This is all using the amazing templates, but then the point and click customization.
[01:23:36.960 --> 01:23:40.960]   Here's Jeff Kanata's site, another revision three fella.
[01:23:40.960 --> 01:23:43.960]   He does a really nice job on here.
[01:23:43.960 --> 01:23:45.960]   The totally rad show.
[01:23:45.960 --> 01:23:49.960]   Squarespace.com is a secret to amazing websites.

[01:23:57.960 --> 01:24:04.960]   They've got importing from virtually all the web blog sites so you can import your data
[01:24:04.960 --> 01:24:05.960]   so you don't start from scratch.

[01:24:13.960 --> 01:24:14.960]   Really fantastic.

[01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:34.960]   I love it.
[01:24:34.960 --> 01:24:35.960]   I know you will too.
[01:24:35.960 --> 01:24:36.960]   squarespace.com.
[01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:38.960]   Yoshi, do you have a website?
[01:24:38.960 --> 01:24:41.960]   I have not been keeping my website.
[01:24:41.960 --> 01:24:42.960]   It still exists.
[01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:45.960]   And for some strange reasons, people still go there, but I have not.
[01:24:45.960 --> 01:24:47.960]   You had a forum for a while that was great.
[01:24:47.960 --> 01:24:49.960]   What is your site?
[01:24:49.960 --> 01:24:50.960]   Yoshi.us/twit.
[01:24:50.960 --> 01:24:55.960]   I mean, I literally have not been up here yet, but it's still...
[01:24:55.960 --> 01:24:58.960]   You and Patrick...
[01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:01.960]   And, uh, Roger, do you have a site?
[01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:02.960]   No.
[01:25:02.960 --> 01:25:03.960]   See, you guys...
[01:25:03.960 --> 01:25:05.960]   Actually, I have a site launching shortly.
[01:25:05.960 --> 01:25:06.960]   Is this the Type-AD site?
[01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:07.960]   Are you going to do a squarespace site?
[01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:09.960]   Do a squarespace site, would you?
[01:25:09.960 --> 01:25:11.960]   We have a couple squarespace sites over here.
[01:25:11.960 --> 01:25:12.960]   Do you?
[01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:15.960]   Yeah, the No Agenda Show.com is a squarespace site.
[01:25:15.960 --> 01:25:16.960]   Really?
[01:25:16.960 --> 01:25:17.960]   I didn't know that.
[01:25:17.960 --> 01:25:18.960]   Yep.
[01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:22.960]   Uh, Eileen tells me, she does our new producer, by the way.
[01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:24.960]   We want to welcome Eileen Rivera.
[01:25:24.960 --> 01:25:25.960]   Yeah.
[01:25:25.960 --> 01:25:26.960]   We stole her.
[01:25:26.960 --> 01:25:29.960]   Jim Laderbeck called me up and said, "You've poached our best employee."
[01:25:29.960 --> 01:25:31.960]   I think that's telling those guys.
[01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:34.960]   I'm sorry because you guys watched the presets of the company.
[01:25:34.960 --> 01:25:37.960]   You are a valuable asset, but you're not the most cheerful asset.
[01:25:37.960 --> 01:25:39.960]   And I was not in the...
[01:25:39.960 --> 01:25:40.960]   Roger, you're a good person.
[01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:42.960]   You want to come to work for me, Roger?
[01:25:42.960 --> 01:25:43.960]   You know where to...
[01:25:43.960 --> 01:25:44.960]   No, I'm not...
[01:25:44.960 --> 01:25:47.960]   I didn't poach anybody, but Tom Merritt came here and Eileen happens to know him.
[01:25:47.960 --> 01:25:51.960]   And so, you know, it just happened that way.
[01:25:51.960 --> 01:25:53.960]   And they also are like, 20 miles from me.
[01:25:53.960 --> 01:25:54.960]   They're less than that, right?
[01:25:54.960 --> 01:25:58.960]   Yeah, they moved to Marin because Tom's working here and they decided to be easier for anyway.
[01:25:58.960 --> 01:26:00.960]   We're so happy to have Eileen.
[01:26:00.960 --> 01:26:02.960]   She does a podcast called Bike Club.
[01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:03.960]   You know about Bike Club, right?
[01:26:03.960 --> 01:26:04.960]   It involves vampires.
[01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:05.960]   Yeah.
[01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:07.960]   Yeah, I like to know who came up with the name for that podcast.
[01:26:07.960 --> 01:26:08.960]   Was it you, Roger Chang?
[01:26:08.960 --> 01:26:09.960]   Yes, it was.
[01:26:09.960 --> 01:26:10.960]   He's Changry.
[01:26:10.960 --> 01:26:12.960]   He is very mad.
[01:26:12.960 --> 01:26:14.960]   He's cheating.
[01:26:14.960 --> 01:26:17.960]   He's cheating.
[01:26:17.960 --> 01:26:19.960]   And by the way, Robert's looking to be called back.
[01:26:19.960 --> 01:26:20.960]   I'm back.
[01:26:20.960 --> 01:26:21.960]   It's just your back.
[01:26:21.960 --> 01:26:22.960]   I called him and didn't.
[01:26:22.960 --> 01:26:23.960]   I don't know.
[01:26:23.960 --> 01:26:24.960]   Did you figure it out, Robert?
[01:26:24.960 --> 01:26:25.960]   What was going on?
[01:26:25.960 --> 01:26:26.960]   I have no idea.
[01:26:26.960 --> 01:26:29.960]   It just suddenly all audio stopped on my end and I never did.
[01:26:29.960 --> 01:26:32.960]   It indicated in Skype that my connection was lagging for some reason,
[01:26:32.960 --> 01:26:34.960]   but now I'm back up to full of vampires.
[01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:35.960]   Well, I just like to make a point.
[01:26:35.960 --> 01:26:38.960]   Please don't watch the show because we kind of mocked you.
[01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:39.960]   It's okay.
[01:26:39.960 --> 01:26:41.960]   Was I nerding out?
[01:26:41.960 --> 01:26:42.960]   No, it was awesome.
[01:26:42.960 --> 01:26:44.960]   We all wanted to hear what you were saying.
[01:26:44.960 --> 01:26:47.960]   We had like your really enthusiastic stream.
[01:26:47.960 --> 01:26:48.960]   I was on it.
[01:26:48.960 --> 01:26:49.960]   And we were like, "Okay.
[01:26:49.960 --> 01:26:50.960]   Well, remember what you said.
[01:26:50.960 --> 01:26:53.960]   I'm going to ask you in a second about Google TV again.
[01:26:53.960 --> 01:26:58.960]   Is this the same Bike Club, the resource for the restaurant and bar culture?
[01:26:58.960 --> 01:27:00.960]   And it's Bike Club SF, I believe.
[01:27:00.960 --> 01:27:01.960]   Wait, no, it's the Bike Club Show.
[01:27:01.960 --> 01:27:04.960]   Bikeclubshow.com, is it?
[01:27:04.960 --> 01:27:05.960]   Okay.
[01:27:05.960 --> 01:27:06.960]   This is it.
[01:27:06.960 --> 01:27:11.960]   But anyway, she was telling me that baby Jessica's blog from True Blood is a
[01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:14.960]   Squarespace blog, which kind of impressed me.
[01:27:14.960 --> 01:27:16.960]   I mean, that's probably got a lot of traffic.
[01:27:16.960 --> 01:27:18.960]   Which vampires do you like best?
[01:27:18.960 --> 01:27:21.960]   The Twilight vampires?
[01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:24.960]   She's laughing like a crazed True Blood.
[01:27:24.960 --> 01:27:26.960]   You better believe it, baby.
[01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:27.960]   Okay.
[01:27:27.960 --> 01:27:28.960]   Okay.
[01:27:28.960 --> 01:27:29.960]   Get it out of the--
[01:27:29.960 --> 01:27:30.960]   Okay.
[01:27:30.960 --> 01:27:31.960]   Get in my belly.
[01:27:31.960 --> 01:27:34.960]   So Robert, now that we've got you back.
[01:27:34.960 --> 01:27:35.960]   Yes.
[01:27:35.960 --> 01:27:36.960]   What do you think?
[01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:37.960]   Are you-- you said you--
[01:27:37.960 --> 01:27:40.960]   Well, all we heard was you were excited about Google TV.
[01:27:40.960 --> 01:27:44.960]   I was simply hoping that it becomes the first, at least, to hold for consumers to get all
[01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:46.960]   a cart choice for premium content.
[01:27:46.960 --> 01:27:47.960]   Yes!
[01:27:47.960 --> 01:27:48.960]   Thank you.
[01:27:48.960 --> 01:27:50.960]   The whole bit with-- I mean, YouTube videos are great.
[01:27:50.960 --> 01:27:55.960]   The population creating content that others can see easily is wonderful.
[01:27:55.960 --> 01:28:00.960]   But for the content that we look at on TV that we all really want and generally have
[01:28:00.960 --> 01:28:04.960]   to pay for through either a cable or satellite subscription, somebody's got to start delivering
[01:28:04.960 --> 01:28:05.960]   this stuff online somehow.
[01:28:05.960 --> 01:28:08.960]   And I could even care less about quality at this point.
[01:28:08.960 --> 01:28:09.960]   That's the interesting thing, isn't it?
[01:28:09.960 --> 01:28:11.960]   Well, we figured that out.
[01:28:11.960 --> 01:28:13.960]   It'll be 720p, but--
[01:28:13.960 --> 01:28:14.960]   Cool.
[01:28:14.960 --> 01:28:17.960]   720p's fine.
[01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:19.960]   720p's fine.
[01:28:19.960 --> 01:28:21.960]   So how about Apple TV?
[01:28:21.960 --> 01:28:24.960]   Were you disappointed that they didn't really go all our cart?
[01:28:24.960 --> 01:28:27.960]   I mean, they-- they did all our cart, but they could have put apps in there.
[01:28:27.960 --> 01:28:29.960]   They really could have done something a little more exciting.
[01:28:29.960 --> 01:28:30.960]   Well, here's the thing.
[01:28:30.960 --> 01:28:38.960]   As somebody who owns an iPad, the iPhone apps look pretty mediocre on the iPad by-- by
[01:28:38.960 --> 01:28:39.960]   just by Dublin.
[01:28:39.960 --> 01:28:40.960]   Well, what about the Hulu?
[01:28:40.960 --> 01:28:41.960]   No, no, you'd have to use iPad apps.
[01:28:41.960 --> 01:28:42.960]   But take--
[01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:43.960]   Or Apple TV apps.
[01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:45.960]   Or take those applications and try to dump them onto the Apple TV.
[01:28:45.960 --> 01:28:46.960]   Yeah, I see what you're saying.
[01:28:46.960 --> 01:28:47.960]   But you're saying there.
[01:28:47.960 --> 01:28:48.960]   Right?
[01:28:48.960 --> 01:28:49.960]   Right.
[01:28:49.960 --> 01:28:52.960]   Would-- two, there's interface issues trying to use the Apple TV in its kernel-- current
[01:28:52.960 --> 01:28:53.960]   incarnation.
[01:28:53.960 --> 01:28:54.960]   Three--
[01:28:54.960 --> 01:28:57.960]   No, but the new-- the new Apple TV's iOS, and it's got an A4.
[01:28:57.960 --> 01:28:58.960]   It is basically an iPad.
[01:28:58.960 --> 01:29:03.960]   I understand that, but-- you know, in which case, if you want to use-- if you want to use
[01:29:03.960 --> 01:29:10.960]   an Apple iOS interface with the Apple TV, you need to own an iPhone or an iPad to use as
[01:29:10.960 --> 01:29:11.960]   the input.
[01:29:11.960 --> 01:29:12.960]   Or--
[01:29:12.960 --> 01:29:13.960]   Or--
[01:29:13.960 --> 01:29:14.960]   Or--
[01:29:14.960 --> 01:29:15.960]   A Magic Trackpad, which they sell for $60.
[01:29:15.960 --> 01:29:16.960]   OK.
[01:29:16.960 --> 01:29:19.960]   So then you take the entry on that from $99 to $20 degrees.
[01:29:19.960 --> 01:29:20.960]   It's a great price, right?
[01:29:20.960 --> 01:29:21.960]   Roku--
[01:29:21.960 --> 01:29:22.960]   I'm just disappointed.
[01:29:22.960 --> 01:29:23.960]   Here's why I'm disappointed.
[01:29:23.960 --> 01:29:24.960]   No, you're right.
[01:29:24.960 --> 01:29:25.960]   I completely agree with you.
[01:29:25.960 --> 01:29:26.960]   It's logistically difficult.
[01:29:26.960 --> 01:29:30.960]   But I would have loved-- I could have bought a Hulu TV and put Hulu Plus on there.
[01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:32.960]   I mean, talk about all of cart, Robert.
[01:29:32.960 --> 01:29:38.960]   You're talking about now, I can put-- you know, HBO wants to make a True Blood app.
[01:29:38.960 --> 01:29:40.960]   I buy True Blood that way, right?
[01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:42.960]   Wouldn't that be the best way to do it?
[01:29:42.960 --> 01:29:43.960]   I agree.
[01:29:43.960 --> 01:29:47.960]   I think one of the big hold-ups for a-- well, for quite a few people, at least, will be
[01:29:47.960 --> 01:29:49.960]   sports content and premiums for the content.
[01:29:49.960 --> 01:29:50.960]   Okay, look, live stuff.
[01:29:50.960 --> 01:29:51.960]   ESPN and--
[01:29:51.960 --> 01:29:56.960]   ESPN and Speed Channel and some of the other stuff that you can only get and only watch through
[01:29:56.960 --> 01:29:58.960]   paid subscriptions through your cable level.
[01:29:58.960 --> 01:29:59.960]   I can tell you something.
[01:29:59.960 --> 01:30:01.960]   I watched the World Cup-- I was at a conference.
[01:30:01.960 --> 01:30:03.960]   I couldn't watch a TV.
[01:30:03.960 --> 01:30:06.960]   I, like a lot of other people, bought-- what was it?
[01:30:06.960 --> 01:30:07.960]   The Flow TV?
[01:30:07.960 --> 01:30:08.960]   No, Moby.
[01:30:08.960 --> 01:30:09.960]   Moby TV.
[01:30:09.960 --> 01:30:10.960]   I watched the whole-- I watched World Cup games on my iPhone.
[01:30:10.960 --> 01:30:11.960]   It was awesome.
[01:30:11.960 --> 01:30:12.960]   Yes.
[01:30:12.960 --> 01:30:13.960]   Yes, that's the true all-acart experience.
[01:30:13.960 --> 01:30:14.960]   And that was a sporting event.
[01:30:14.960 --> 01:30:17.960]   Now, admittedly, it wasn't the largest screen ever.
[01:30:17.960 --> 01:30:20.960]   But if you attach that to, you know, an Apple TV--
[01:30:20.960 --> 01:30:25.960]   But they're also streaming all-- they were streaming that stuff on ESPN 60 or whatever.
[01:30:25.960 --> 01:30:27.960]   They choose it to ESPN--
[01:30:27.960 --> 01:30:28.960]   Elocho.
[01:30:28.960 --> 01:30:29.960]   Elocho.
[01:30:29.960 --> 01:30:34.680]   Yeah, I mean, if you do MLB TV and you pay for that, I mean, I think ultimately you'll
[01:30:34.680 --> 01:30:38.960]   be able to watch anything you want via some kind of internet connected device to your television.
[01:30:38.960 --> 01:30:43.120]   The content creators like it, because, like, if you're the Academy Awards, you get direct
[01:30:43.120 --> 01:30:45.320]   revenue from the people watching the show.
[01:30:45.320 --> 01:30:48.720]   You might-- you know, the advertisers know exactly how many people are watching it, so
[01:30:48.720 --> 01:30:49.720]   you can charge it better.
[01:30:49.720 --> 01:30:50.720]   I mean, the biggest impediment is--
[01:30:50.720 --> 01:30:51.720]   Disintermediation.
[01:30:51.720 --> 01:30:55.560]   Yeah, it's a lot of media tradition and, oh, yes, all of the contracts with all of the
[01:30:55.560 --> 01:30:56.560]   cable companies.
[01:30:56.560 --> 01:30:58.200]   Well, that's who hates this, right?
[01:30:58.200 --> 01:31:00.520]   Because they're basically becoming bits providers.
[01:31:00.520 --> 01:31:02.200]   They no longer sell premium content.
[01:31:02.200 --> 01:31:04.600]   Anyway, do you think Google TV will become that?
[01:31:04.600 --> 01:31:06.520]   Now that Apple has said, "Man, we're not going to do that."
[01:31:06.520 --> 01:31:07.520]   Is that where Google--
[01:31:07.520 --> 01:31:09.720]   Well, I mean, right now, there's a really great article--
[01:31:09.720 --> 01:31:10.720]   I just drank some--
[01:31:10.720 --> 01:31:12.720]   I don't want to say things all things deep.
[01:31:12.720 --> 01:31:13.720]   And it's just gone faster and faster.
[01:31:13.720 --> 01:31:15.720]   It's gone right to my head.
[01:31:15.720 --> 01:31:21.680]   Go on to Carolina Sunshine and a lot of corn syrup in every sip of sun drop.
[01:31:21.680 --> 01:31:23.280]   You thought Mountain Dew was hot, man.
[01:31:23.280 --> 01:31:24.280]   It's a good stop there.
[01:31:24.280 --> 01:31:25.280]   I love that, man.
[01:31:25.280 --> 01:31:26.280]   I just need the bottles, man.
[01:31:26.280 --> 01:31:27.280]   I'll be happy.
[01:31:27.280 --> 01:31:29.280]   I was really happy with you.
[01:31:29.280 --> 01:31:30.280]   Sparkling.
[01:31:30.280 --> 01:31:31.280]   Where did they bring in there?
[01:31:31.280 --> 01:31:32.280]   I don't know.
[01:31:32.280 --> 01:31:33.280]   Happiness, John.
[01:31:33.280 --> 01:31:34.280]   It's good.
[01:31:34.280 --> 01:31:35.280]   It's happiness.
[01:31:35.280 --> 01:31:39.440]   The-- but it's like one of the things I think it was-- all things D said was the real
[01:31:39.440 --> 01:31:45.040]   winner-- Apple TV proves the real winner right now in the battle for the living room is Netflix.
[01:31:45.040 --> 01:31:46.040]   Because everybody is Netflix.
[01:31:46.040 --> 01:31:47.520]   You've got to have Netflix.
[01:31:47.520 --> 01:31:49.480]   You know, Blu-ray players are doing Netflix.
[01:31:49.480 --> 01:31:50.480]   And you've got to have devices.
[01:31:50.480 --> 01:31:51.480]   You know, appliances are doing Netflix.
[01:31:51.480 --> 01:31:52.480]   Set top boxes are doing Netflix.
[01:31:52.480 --> 01:31:54.120]   But that just proves Robert's point.
[01:31:54.120 --> 01:31:55.120]   The Ola Cart point.
[01:31:55.120 --> 01:31:56.280]   That's Ola Cart, isn't it?
[01:31:56.280 --> 01:31:57.280]   It's Ola Cart.
[01:31:57.280 --> 01:32:02.160]   But we need, you know, somebody with enough money and clout and time to make Ola Cart effective.
[01:32:02.160 --> 01:32:04.160]   The interesting thing about Google versus Netflix--
[01:32:04.160 --> 01:32:05.160]   It's Google is big enough.
[01:32:05.160 --> 01:32:06.800]   Google is big enough.
[01:32:06.800 --> 01:32:11.000]   Google is big enough that they're starting a music service ostensibly to compete with
[01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:12.000]   iTunes.
[01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:13.560]   It's supposed to be out by the end of this year.
[01:32:13.560 --> 01:32:17.960]   They're hiring the managers at this point or the person responsible.
[01:32:17.960 --> 01:32:22.800]   But yeah, the idea that they built the Google TV box, the idea is that it's going to sit
[01:32:22.800 --> 01:32:27.120]   in between your cable box or your direct TV box or it's going to be your dish network
[01:32:27.120 --> 01:32:28.120]   box and your TV.
[01:32:28.120 --> 01:32:29.120]   Are we going to have--
[01:32:29.120 --> 01:32:30.120]   Well, that's why--
[01:32:30.120 --> 01:32:31.120]   Yeah.
[01:32:31.120 --> 01:32:32.120]   Well, I only--
[01:32:32.120 --> 01:32:33.120]   I only--
[01:32:33.120 --> 01:32:34.120]   Seven at this point.
[01:32:34.120 --> 01:32:35.120]   That's why apps are so important.
[01:32:35.120 --> 01:32:37.960]   Because one box that supports apps, you add the apps you want.
[01:32:37.960 --> 01:32:38.960]   It's all one box.
[01:32:38.960 --> 01:32:39.960]   But that's the same thing.
[01:32:39.960 --> 01:32:43.480]   Do I care if the-- you're like, I want everything to be on iOS because Steve can do
[01:32:43.480 --> 01:32:44.480]   anything.
[01:32:44.480 --> 01:32:45.480]   No, no, no, no.
[01:32:45.480 --> 01:32:46.480]   Actually, what is--
[01:32:46.480 --> 01:32:47.480]   What is--
[01:32:47.480 --> 01:32:50.440]   Google TV allowed me to buy my television shows.
[01:32:50.440 --> 01:32:51.440]   That'd be fine.
[01:32:51.440 --> 01:32:52.440]   By clicking on a button.
[01:32:52.440 --> 01:32:54.360]   Or subscribe to ESPN for 24-hour months.
[01:32:54.360 --> 01:32:58.920]   That's what I'm saying is I think Apple dropped the ball and Google now has an opportunity
[01:32:58.920 --> 01:33:00.480]   to do this very thing.
[01:33:00.480 --> 01:33:03.280]   Unless Apple's trying to negotiate deals directly with all of the--
[01:33:03.280 --> 01:33:04.280]   That's a mistake.
[01:33:04.280 --> 01:33:08.600]   Or if they need one of those weird third parties, I've got to find some cable company in Tim
[01:33:08.600 --> 01:33:11.120]   Buck 2 that has a weird hole in their license that'll allow me to--
[01:33:11.120 --> 01:33:12.120]   No, no, no, no.
[01:33:12.120 --> 01:33:13.120]   No, no, no.
[01:33:13.120 --> 01:33:14.120]   This is a mistake.
[01:33:14.120 --> 01:33:15.120]   All Apple has to do is put the platform out there.
[01:33:15.120 --> 01:33:16.600]   It's about platforms.
[01:33:16.600 --> 01:33:18.480]   And this is what Microsoft learned.
[01:33:18.480 --> 01:33:20.920]   You provide the platform.
[01:33:20.920 --> 01:33:22.960]   And you let people write to the platform.
[01:33:22.960 --> 01:33:26.400]   Apple gets 30% of every subscription of everything.
[01:33:26.400 --> 01:33:31.440]   So if you say, here's the platform, HBO, you want to make a true blood app fine.
[01:33:31.440 --> 01:33:33.560]   Hulu, you want to do Hulu plus fine.
[01:33:33.560 --> 01:33:35.480]   You want to MLB, you want to do a baseball app fine.
[01:33:35.480 --> 01:33:38.720]   You get 30% because that's how it works.
[01:33:38.720 --> 01:33:40.280]   And they don't have to make a deal with anybody.
[01:33:40.280 --> 01:33:41.920]   So it's just like a Roku box then.
[01:33:41.920 --> 01:33:44.440]   It's a Roku box, universal Roku box.
[01:33:44.440 --> 01:33:46.560]   I think that the box--
[01:33:46.560 --> 01:33:50.640]   The set-top boxes themselves are really a stopgap measure for the time being until everyone
[01:33:50.640 --> 01:33:55.600]   owns a TV that's essentially a full-blown computer where you have a selection of applications
[01:33:55.600 --> 01:33:57.280]   that you can choose from from anybody.
[01:33:57.280 --> 01:34:00.080]   Well, isn't Sony going to do that with Google TV?
[01:34:00.080 --> 01:34:03.280]   And Samsung made some noise that they made me do.
[01:34:03.280 --> 01:34:07.480]   Samsung had a whole application developers day about two weeks ago in San Francisco.
[01:34:07.480 --> 01:34:12.000]   That was phenomenally eye-opening in terms of what they really want to do in terms of
[01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:16.040]   essentially there is a store now with your TV, just like you have with your smartphone.
[01:34:16.040 --> 01:34:21.880]   Here's why they're pitfall is if there's a Sony way of doing it and a Samsung way of
[01:34:21.880 --> 01:34:24.760]   doing it and a Vizio way of doing it, that's not going to work.
[01:34:24.760 --> 01:34:28.400]   That's why Google has to step in or Apple or somebody has stepped in and said, "Here's
[01:34:28.400 --> 01:34:31.920]   the platform right to this platform and it'll work on all the TVs."
[01:34:31.920 --> 01:34:36.600]   Now, there's not going to be one-- I mean, right now you've got Comcast competing with
[01:34:36.600 --> 01:34:38.680]   direct TV, competing with whoever else.
[01:34:38.680 --> 01:34:44.560]   You're going to have your set-top boxes competing with your Roku's and your boxys and your
[01:34:44.560 --> 01:34:46.000]   Apple TVs and your Google TVs.
[01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:49.880]   There's going to be at least a couple of players and hopefully there's a compatibility
[01:34:49.880 --> 01:34:54.200]   or some kind of a standard so that you can make universal binaries if you don't stuff
[01:34:54.200 --> 01:34:55.200]   to work on other places.
[01:34:55.200 --> 01:34:59.480]   That's why Netflix is available through the PS3, through the Wii, through the Roku, through
[01:34:59.480 --> 01:35:01.520]   Boxy, through all of that.
[01:35:01.520 --> 01:35:04.880]   Same with you want Twit to be available on all that stuff and we want Revision 3 to be
[01:35:04.880 --> 01:35:05.880]   available on all that stuff.
[01:35:05.880 --> 01:35:07.520]   Well, that's why we're excited about it, isn't it?
[01:35:07.520 --> 01:35:08.520]   Because it puts us on a priority.
[01:35:08.520 --> 01:35:10.880]   And you've got different models also for us.
[01:35:10.880 --> 01:35:14.880]   And it's like we want to be available for free everywhere, people like Twit and Revision 3,
[01:35:14.880 --> 01:35:19.000]   but then you've got people like HBO who can also get in the same game and have apps available
[01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.960]   at different places, but you'll have to subscribe for it, which people will do.
[01:35:21.960 --> 01:35:24.240]   So why isn't this happening?
[01:35:24.240 --> 01:35:29.440]   Because nobody's built the box that everybody's going to have or created the platform.
[01:35:29.440 --> 01:35:30.440]   Doesn't have to be the box.
[01:35:30.440 --> 01:35:31.440]   It has to be the platform.
[01:35:31.440 --> 01:35:36.400]   Okay, but I'm saying, nobody's also figured out the platform that everyone will write
[01:35:36.400 --> 01:35:41.120]   to because Samsung and Sony and LG and, you know, umpteen other companies, they're all
[01:35:41.120 --> 01:35:46.920]   in competition with these are the same more on who gave us HD DVD versus Blu-ray VHS versus
[01:35:46.920 --> 01:35:48.080]   beta.
[01:35:48.080 --> 01:35:49.440]   Are we going down that same road?
[01:35:49.440 --> 01:35:50.440]   We're already there, dude.
[01:35:50.440 --> 01:35:52.200]   Oh, it sucks.
[01:35:52.200 --> 01:35:53.200]   That just sucks.
[01:35:53.200 --> 01:35:57.400]   But you could see something though like Android or some open platform becoming the basis for
[01:35:57.400 --> 01:35:58.880]   all of these devices though.
[01:35:58.880 --> 01:36:03.360]   And that helps alleviate the whole issue of having different platforms to develop for
[01:36:03.360 --> 01:36:06.240]   if you're the content owner or you just want to make one of these apps.
[01:36:06.240 --> 01:36:10.240]   It's like, oh, I got to choose between whether I developed for a Sony TV or Samsung box or
[01:36:10.240 --> 01:36:13.280]   a Roku box or what have I think that's what Google's plan is.
[01:36:13.280 --> 01:36:15.280]   That's why they and read his open source.
[01:36:15.280 --> 01:36:16.520]   You can use it for free, right?
[01:36:16.520 --> 01:36:18.720]   Is it all going to end up in the TV?
[01:36:18.720 --> 01:36:20.560]   No more of these stupid boxes.
[01:36:20.560 --> 01:36:21.560]   Yeah.
[01:36:21.560 --> 01:36:22.560]   Well, you know what?
[01:36:22.560 --> 01:36:28.160]   I don't actually mind the box because, you know, say if you buy a new box and buy a
[01:36:28.160 --> 01:36:29.160]   new TV.
[01:36:29.160 --> 01:36:30.160]   I prefer the box myself.
[01:36:30.160 --> 01:36:31.160]   Yeah.
[01:36:31.160 --> 01:36:35.360]   If the box supports apps, all the upgrade is done in software.
[01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:37.200]   But the Blu-ray, you know, your Blu-ray player.
[01:36:37.200 --> 01:36:38.200]   It could be in a Blu-ray player.

[01:43:27.200 --> 01:43:31.200]   [laughter]
[01:43:31.200 --> 01:43:33.200]   Okay, John, I'll give it to you.
[01:43:33.200 --> 01:43:35.200]   I'll give it to you.
[01:43:35.200 --> 01:43:37.200]   [laughter]
[01:43:37.200 --> 01:43:41.200]   By the way, John's a host of the incredible Swanky Geeks program,
[01:43:41.200 --> 01:43:45.200]   which you can catch every Wednesday.
[01:43:45.200 --> 01:43:49.200]   That looking good, Jason.
[01:43:49.200 --> 01:43:51.200]   With Fabio C. Devorak.
[01:43:51.200 --> 01:43:55.200]   Wow, that's attractive.
[01:43:55.200 --> 01:43:57.200]   Great tone. Good tone, John.
[01:43:57.200 --> 01:43:59.200]   You've been lifting? You've been working out a lot.
[01:43:59.200 --> 01:44:01.200]   Two giant yellow bellows.
[01:44:01.200 --> 01:44:03.200]   [laughter]
[01:44:03.200 --> 01:44:05.200]   Stud muffin.
[01:44:05.200 --> 01:44:07.200]   If you want to know more about John, there's one place, one place only to go,
[01:44:07.200 --> 01:44:09.200]   and that is channeldevorak.com.
[01:44:09.200 --> 01:44:13.200]   That's the place where you can find Swanky Geeks, the tech.
[01:44:13.200 --> 01:44:15.200]   What is it, nerd?
[01:44:15.200 --> 01:44:19.200]   Tech hippie, the tech grouch, the noagendashow.com,
[01:44:19.200 --> 01:44:21.200]   and whatever.
[01:44:21.200 --> 01:44:23.200]   Lots of things going on.
[01:44:23.200 --> 01:44:25.200]   And whatever.
[01:44:25.200 --> 01:44:27.200]   Hey, you know what I'm excited about.
[01:44:27.200 --> 01:44:29.200]   Before we go, I was going to start to wrap up,
[01:44:29.200 --> 01:44:31.200]   and I'm going to mention this.
[01:44:31.200 --> 01:44:33.200]   Galaxy S tab,
[01:44:33.200 --> 01:44:35.200]   the new Samsung tablet,
[01:44:35.200 --> 01:44:37.200]   they got it on Verizon, AT&T,
[01:44:37.200 --> 01:44:39.200]   and Sprint.
[01:44:39.200 --> 01:44:41.200]   It's going to come out September 16th,
[01:44:41.200 --> 01:44:43.200]   7-inch tablet running Android.
[01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:45.200]   Have you seen this? This looks very sweet,
[01:44:45.200 --> 01:44:49.200]   and they got it on three big carriers.
[01:44:49.200 --> 01:44:51.200]   Who's going for this product?
[01:44:51.200 --> 01:44:53.200]   Everybody wants to see it, huh?
[01:44:53.200 --> 01:44:55.200]   I don't know. I will buy one right away.
[01:44:55.200 --> 01:44:57.200]   You buy everything right away.
[01:44:57.200 --> 01:44:59.200]   I'm well, okay.
[01:44:59.200 --> 01:45:01.200]   I happen to like, you know, my Android.
[01:45:01.200 --> 01:45:03.200]   What's it going to cost?
[01:45:03.200 --> 01:45:05.200]   Two to three hundred dollars subsidized.
[01:45:05.200 --> 01:45:07.200]   So with a two-year,
[01:45:07.200 --> 01:45:09.200]   so basically it's-
[01:45:09.200 --> 01:45:11.200]   You'll be buying a contract because it's 3G.
[01:45:11.200 --> 01:45:15.200]   Look, here's a stunning video to get you excited about it.
[01:45:15.200 --> 01:45:19.200]   So it's 7 inches.
[01:45:19.200 --> 01:45:21.200]   So it's a little bigger than the street,
[01:45:21.200 --> 01:45:23.200]   but a little smaller than the iPad.
[01:45:23.200 --> 01:45:25.200]   It looks like a really big one.
[01:45:25.200 --> 01:45:29.200]   It looks like a really lengthy iPhone.
[01:45:29.200 --> 01:45:31.200]   Yeah, but it's not a phone.
[01:45:31.200 --> 01:45:33.200]   It's not a phone though, so it's just a tablet.
[01:45:33.200 --> 01:45:35.200]   It's not a phone. It's a tablet, but it can make phone phones.
[01:45:35.200 --> 01:45:39.200]   You know, is that roughly the same size as the Newton?
[01:45:39.200 --> 01:45:41.200]   The same size as the Evo.
[01:45:41.200 --> 01:45:43.200]   No, it's smaller than the Evo.
[01:45:43.200 --> 01:45:45.200]   I have a Droid X. I like the 4-inch screen, but I think
[01:45:45.200 --> 01:45:47.200]   a 7-inch. Now this is kind of stupid.
[01:45:47.200 --> 01:45:49.200]   That's the augmented reality browser.
[01:45:49.200 --> 01:45:51.200]   This video makes it look like he's going to walk
[01:45:51.200 --> 01:45:53.200]   into the middle of the street and get hit by a car.
[01:45:53.200 --> 01:45:55.200]   He's still...
[01:45:55.200 --> 01:45:57.200]   He's looking at the thing.
[01:45:57.200 --> 01:45:59.200]   It's a little scary, isn't it?
[01:45:59.200 --> 01:46:01.200]   You know, if you look up, buddy, you know where you are.
[01:46:01.200 --> 01:46:03.200]   Yeah, no, no. It's much better to interact with your device
[01:46:03.200 --> 01:46:05.200]   and see where you are.
[01:46:05.200 --> 01:46:07.200]   Oh, yeah, I haven't forbid I can actually see these objects.
[01:46:07.200 --> 01:46:09.200]   I'll look at them through here.
[01:46:09.200 --> 01:46:15.200]   You can pretty much do that with Street View, by the way.
[01:46:15.200 --> 01:46:17.200]   Street View on your phone.
[01:46:17.200 --> 01:46:19.200]   I agree.
[01:46:19.200 --> 01:46:21.200]   And you can just walk down the street and stare at your phone
[01:46:21.200 --> 01:46:23.200]   and see what's out there.
[01:46:23.200 --> 01:46:25.200]   It stands the cars in the way.
[01:46:25.200 --> 01:46:27.200]   You know what's so creepy is when, like,
[01:46:27.200 --> 01:46:29.200]   you're in front of somewhere and then you're looking at it
[01:46:29.200 --> 01:46:33.200]   on your computer and then you look up and it's the same place.
[01:46:33.200 --> 01:46:37.200]   Do you sure?
[01:46:37.200 --> 01:46:39.200]   Yoshi, thank you so much for being here.
[01:46:39.200 --> 01:46:41.200]   We really appreciate it. It's so great to hear from you.
[01:46:41.200 --> 01:46:43.200]   Glad you're doing well.
[01:46:43.200 --> 01:46:45.200]   Yeah, it's fun to get out. Sorry I was driving the whole time
[01:46:45.200 --> 01:46:47.200]   and not as interactive.
[01:46:47.200 --> 01:46:49.200]   No, no, no, no. You were driving?
[01:46:49.200 --> 01:46:51.200]   I would.
[01:46:51.200 --> 01:46:52.200]   Yeah.
[01:46:52.200 --> 01:46:55.200]   He wants to get back to Hotlanta.
[01:46:55.200 --> 01:46:57.200]   Well, it's great.
[01:46:57.200 --> 01:46:59.200]   I just don't like driving in that truck.
[01:46:59.200 --> 01:47:01.200]   It's so great to talk to you.
[01:47:01.200 --> 01:47:03.200]   Say, give our best to Carrie and Cruz.
[01:47:03.200 --> 01:47:05.200]   And the next time you're in Northern California,
[01:47:05.200 --> 01:47:07.200]   please stop and we'd love to see you.
[01:47:07.200 --> 01:47:08.200]   Definitely.
[01:47:08.200 --> 01:47:09.200]   Thank you, Yoshi.
[01:47:09.200 --> 01:47:10.200]   Thank you.
[01:47:10.200 --> 01:47:13.200]   It's so great. I've been trying to get Yoshi on this show for four years.
[01:47:13.200 --> 01:47:15.200]   Four years.
[01:47:15.200 --> 01:47:17.200]   So I've not even got a hold of them.
[01:47:17.200 --> 01:47:19.200]   Thanks to Eileen.
[01:47:19.200 --> 01:47:20.200]   She's a good producer.
[01:47:20.200 --> 01:47:22.200]   See how much better this show is with somebody producing it.
[01:47:22.200 --> 01:47:27.200]   Robert Aaron and Patrick Norton together do HD Nation, a great show.
[01:47:27.200 --> 01:47:28.200]   Thank you.
[01:47:28.200 --> 01:47:30.200]   It's great to see you again, Robert. I haven't seen you in ages,
[01:47:30.200 --> 01:47:32.200]   but don't be a stranger. I love hearing from you.
[01:47:32.200 --> 01:47:34.200]   Always a pleasure there. Thanks so much.
[01:47:34.200 --> 01:47:35.200]   Thank you.
[01:47:35.200 --> 01:47:38.200]   You can catch Patrick also at techzilla.com.
[01:47:38.200 --> 01:47:41.200]   He and Roger Chang. See, there's all this interlanking, uh...
[01:47:41.200 --> 01:47:42.200]   Insestuousness.
[01:47:42.200 --> 01:47:43.200]   Insestuousness.
[01:47:43.200 --> 01:47:44.200]   And Veronica Belmont.
[01:47:44.200 --> 01:47:46.200]   And the lovely Veronica Belmont.
[01:47:46.200 --> 01:47:49.200]   Do you think I could ever lure her to the Twitcottage?
[01:47:49.200 --> 01:47:50.200]   We would...
[01:47:50.200 --> 01:47:52.200]   I would do something horrible.
[01:47:52.200 --> 01:47:55.200]   First of all, it sounds really creepy when you say it that way.
[01:47:55.200 --> 01:47:57.200]   That's creepy. That's very creepy.
[01:47:57.200 --> 01:47:59.200]   Let me lure her to the cottage.
[01:47:59.200 --> 01:48:00.200]   Very, very creepy.
[01:48:00.200 --> 01:48:03.200]   I will epoxy every entrance to your coat.
[01:48:03.200 --> 01:48:04.200]   I won't steal your coat.
[01:48:04.200 --> 01:48:05.200]   I won't steal your coat.
[01:48:05.200 --> 01:48:06.200]   I swear to you.
[01:48:06.200 --> 01:48:09.200]   We'll make you sit and watch nothing but Justin Bieber music videos.
[01:48:09.200 --> 01:48:10.200]   Ah!
[01:48:10.200 --> 01:48:15.200]   Uh, JohnZdivorak.org/blog/channeldivorak.
[01:48:15.200 --> 01:48:17.200]   It's great to have you on once again.
[01:48:17.200 --> 01:48:18.200]   Thank you for joining us.
[01:48:18.200 --> 01:48:19.200]   I appreciate you.
[01:48:19.200 --> 01:48:21.200]   You gotta come up and drink the Laoville.
[01:48:21.200 --> 01:48:23.200]   Yes, we're gonna do that in the next few weeks.
[01:48:23.200 --> 01:48:24.200]   Alright.
[01:48:24.200 --> 01:48:27.200]   Otherwise, I do have Sundrop Pop just for you.
[01:48:27.200 --> 01:48:28.200]   I...
[01:48:28.200 --> 01:48:29.200]   Yeah, I'll be right down the plate.
[01:48:29.200 --> 01:48:32.200]   (laughing)
[01:48:32.200 --> 01:48:33.200]   The green...
[01:48:33.200 --> 01:48:34.200]   What the hell is in that soda?
[01:48:34.200 --> 01:48:35.200]   I don't.
[01:48:35.200 --> 01:48:36.200]   You don't even...
[01:48:36.200 --> 01:48:37.200]   I don't know.
[01:48:37.200 --> 01:48:38.200]   It's good.
[01:48:38.200 --> 01:48:39.200]   It's just water and...
[01:48:39.200 --> 01:48:40.200]   Carbonated water.
[01:48:40.200 --> 01:48:41.200]   High fructose cards here.
[01:48:41.200 --> 01:48:42.200]   That's all I think.
[01:48:42.200 --> 01:48:43.200]   It's just a check-ass.
[01:48:43.200 --> 01:48:44.200]   It's basically kind of like a Mountain Dew.
[01:48:44.200 --> 01:48:45.200]   It's corn syrup.
[01:48:45.200 --> 01:48:48.200]   We need to justify corn subsidies somehow.
[01:48:48.200 --> 01:48:50.200]   (clearing throat)
[01:48:50.200 --> 01:48:51.200]   Lysine, baby.
[01:48:51.200 --> 01:48:53.200]   It's all about the lysine.
[01:48:53.200 --> 01:48:54.200]   I'm Leo LaPorte.
[01:48:54.200 --> 01:48:57.200]   We invite you to stay tuned, Roger Chang.
[01:48:57.200 --> 01:48:59.200]   And Tom Merritt is coming up with East Meets West.
[01:48:59.200 --> 01:49:02.200]   Tom, of course, does our daily news show TNT.
[01:49:02.200 --> 01:49:05.200]   If you wanna hear the news in a fresh format,
[01:49:05.200 --> 01:49:08.200]   in a stylish, fresh format, tune in every Monday through Friday
[01:49:08.200 --> 01:49:12.200]   at 530 Eastern, 230 Pacific at live.twit.tv.
[01:49:12.200 --> 01:49:14.200]   For those of you living outside the U.S.S.S.
[01:49:14.200 --> 01:49:18.200]   is 2230 UTC for Tom and the gang.
[01:49:18.200 --> 01:49:19.200]   I'm Leo LaPorte.
[01:49:19.200 --> 01:49:20.200]   I said that.
[01:49:20.200 --> 01:49:21.200]   Yes.
[01:49:21.200 --> 01:49:22.200]   You're Patrick Norton?
[01:49:22.200 --> 01:49:23.200]   Yes.
[01:49:23.200 --> 01:49:24.200]   You're Roger Chang?
[01:49:24.200 --> 01:49:25.200]   I am.
[01:49:25.200 --> 01:49:27.200]   Robert Herron, David Prager, also at Revision 3.
[01:49:27.200 --> 01:49:30.200]   I knew there was somebody I left out.
[01:49:30.200 --> 01:49:33.200]   Thank you for being here, David.
[01:49:33.200 --> 01:49:34.200]   (bell dings)
[01:49:34.200 --> 01:49:37.200]   (laughter)
[01:49:37.200 --> 01:49:38.200]   Another choice!
[01:49:38.200 --> 01:49:40.200]   This is in the cam!
[01:49:40.200 --> 01:49:42.200]   (upbeat music)
[01:49:42.200 --> 01:49:43.200]   I plotted you out.
[01:49:43.200 --> 01:49:45.200]   I plotted you up my accent and I thought it was Yoshi.
[01:49:45.200 --> 01:49:46.200]   Oh, no.
[01:49:46.200 --> 01:49:47.200]   Sorry.
[01:49:47.200 --> 01:49:50.200]   I spread when I was telling you I was going to Poshy's baby shower.
[01:49:50.200 --> 01:49:51.200]   Oh!
[01:49:51.200 --> 01:49:53.200]   She wanted me to tell you hi.
[01:49:53.200 --> 01:49:54.200]   Poshy's baby shower.
[01:49:54.200 --> 01:49:56.200]   To spoot out her twits so I can go to her.
[01:49:56.200 --> 01:49:59.200]   I convinced her to invite guys to baby shower so I have to go.
[01:49:59.200 --> 01:50:00.200]   Oh, how excited?
[01:50:00.200 --> 01:50:04.200]   Poshy on Twitter, I think.
[01:50:04.200 --> 01:50:05.200]   Poshy.
[01:50:05.200 --> 01:50:06.200]   Well, give her an arbets.
[01:50:06.200 --> 01:50:07.200]   Hey, you Roger.
[01:50:07.200 --> 01:50:08.200]   Yes.
[01:50:08.200 --> 01:50:09.200]   I'll hang up on you guys.
[01:50:09.200 --> 01:50:10.200]   Take care.
[01:50:10.200 --> 01:50:11.200]   I hope I wasn't too grouchy.
[01:50:11.200 --> 01:50:12.200]   You were great.
[01:50:12.200 --> 01:50:13.200]   You were the usual.
[01:50:13.200 --> 01:50:15.200]   That's what we look for for you.
[01:50:15.200 --> 01:50:17.200]   I think I was a little over grouchy today.
[01:50:17.200 --> 01:50:19.200]   No, I like it when you're fiery like that.
[01:50:19.200 --> 01:50:20.200]   Fystee.
[01:50:20.200 --> 01:50:21.200]   Fystee.
[01:50:21.200 --> 01:50:22.200]   Fystee John C.
[01:50:22.200 --> 01:50:24.200]   Is there any other way he comes?
[01:50:24.200 --> 01:50:26.200]   Sometimes he's a little pussy cat.
[01:50:26.200 --> 01:50:28.200]   And sometimes he's just a little pussy.
[01:50:28.200 --> 01:50:29.200]   (laughter)
[01:50:29.200 --> 01:50:30.200]   -Scrims.
[01:50:30.200 --> 01:50:31.200]   -Cheese.
[01:50:31.200 --> 01:50:32.200]   -Hey!
[01:50:32.200 --> 01:50:33.200]   (laughter)
[01:50:33.200 --> 01:50:34.200]   -Hi!
[01:50:34.200 --> 01:50:35.200]   -Hi!
[01:50:35.200 --> 01:50:37.200]   (laughter)
[01:50:37.200 --> 01:50:38.200]   -Hi!
[01:50:38.200 --> 01:50:39.200]   -Doin' a tweet.
[01:50:39.200 --> 01:50:40.200]   -Alright.
[01:50:40.200 --> 01:50:41.200]   -Doin' a tweet, maybe.
[01:50:41.200 --> 01:50:42.200]   -Hi!
