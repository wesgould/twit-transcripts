[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.120]   It's time for Twits this weekend tech, the show
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.000]   where we talk about the tech news with some of the most
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.400]   brilliant and interesting minds in technology.
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.960]   We've got some great minds for you.
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.320]   Here today, my name is Mike Elgin.
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:15.880]   I'm Twits News Director.
[00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.800]   And I'm subbing for Leo, who's even nowhere Leo is.
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.240]   I think he's still in Europe.
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.680]   We don't know.
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.320]   He's floating around on a boat somewhere.
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.840]   He's on a boat.
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.600]   We've got a great, great panel for you today.
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.280]   Some of my favorite people to interview
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.480]   and to have on as panelists and so on, starting with Andy
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.080]   in Notco, technology columnist for the Chicago Sun
[00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.640]   Times, host of Mac Break Weekly, and so much more.
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.640]   Welcome to you, Andy and Notco.
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.120]   It is nice to be welcomed by you on this Sunday.
[00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.800]   I really appreciate you coming on.
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.560]   And speaking of Mac Break Weekly, we also
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.560]   have Renee Ritchie, editor-in-chief of IMOR,
[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.720]   co-host of Mac Break Weekly, and a whole bunch more.
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.240]   Welcome to you, Renee Ritchie.
[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.480]   It feels like an invasion.
[00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.960]   Mike, this is really not what we intended.
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.520]   We're here more as friendly ambassadors.
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:58.400]   Exactly.
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.840]   We come from the world of Apple to spread.
[00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.840]   Now, we're going to find out what Renee Ritchie thinks
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:03.640]   of Android.
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.960]   I think at some point during this show.
[00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.320]   So that'll be really great.
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.400]   And also, one of my favorite interview guests
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.280]   for Tech News today, Jeff John Roberts, who
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.400]   writes about law, culture, and technology and politics.
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.520]   For Fortune, welcome to you, Jeff.
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:18.000]   I'm Mike.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.720]   Good to be here.
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:19.720]   I'm so glad you're here.
[00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.040]   Now, how did you land the sort of law, culture, and technology
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.320]   beat at all the places you've written?
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.680]   Do you have a particular background in law, for example?
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.200]   Yeah, I'm a recovering lawyer.
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.600]   So when I wanted to make my way into journalism,
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.680]   I liked tech, and I had the legal shtick.
[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.640]   So this is where I landed.
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:39.800]   Yeah, you can.
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:40.360]   Go ahead.
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.600]   You write with a conspicuous knowledge of the subject,
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.800]   and I suspect that as much.
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.360]   But as you were saying--
[00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.240]   Yeah, I can't really.
[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.160]   I don't have the same chops on Apple as your other guests.
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.680]   But if they're getting sued all the way in,
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.960]   otherwise I'm going to sit back and enjoy it.
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.800]   You're in because you're really better at Apple or Android.
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.000]   Great, great, great, great.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.360]   So I promise, for those of you, and we
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.080]   do have lots of folks in our audience who just
[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.840]   don't want to hear that much about Apple,
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.000]   we're going to talk about Apple.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.240]   We're going to start with Apple.
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.560]   But I promise this isn't going to be the Apple show.
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.920]   We're going to talk about a couple of stories
[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.240]   that Apple's been involved with.
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:18.360]   We're going to move to other stories as well.
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:22.440]   But let's start with a really interesting bit of news
[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.600]   that came out this week, which is that Apple
[00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.840]   plans to sell third-party products in their stores.
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.360]   But only if they get to help to design the boxes.
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.240]   In other words, they're going for uniformity
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:39.040]   in the appearance of Apple boxes, of third-party products
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:42.480]   and accessories and stuff like that in their stores.
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.240]   Andi Inako, is their control freakery finally
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.600]   gotten out of hand completely?
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:48.680]   What's going on?
[00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.320]   As usual, this is fodder for a really great discussion
[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:52.280]   the week of the announcement.
[00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:53.680]   And then a year later, we realized
[00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.040]   we didn't really notice anything.
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.600]   Basically, it's part of their Made for iPhone program,
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.720]   where if they want to get certified, part of it is now,
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.800]   they have to have input into packaging.
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.400]   Now that's also extending to use in the stores.
[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.000]   And what it looks like, according to people who've
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.160]   had access to the new packaging, is that we're
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.760]   talking about Apple stuff, which is white boxes,
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:19.840]   simple typography, probably also focus on recyclable materials.
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.800]   And it's probably there.
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.760]   It also will help out Apple a lot to make sure
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.080]   that they can rack things the way they
[00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.360]   like to have a nice clean, uncoated appearance.
[00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.640]   And also, it's given that the Apple mall stores are heavy
[00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:35.200]   on having human meat inside their not-ment-based,
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.960]   for actual other products.
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.560]   It's good for them to say, why don't we
[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.400]   get you guys to create packaging that we can efficiently
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.760]   store, efficiently stack, and efficiently display?
[00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:47.760]   I think Apple is now beyond the point of caring
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.360]   if people think that they're control-free or not.
[00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.520]   Because at some point, they're going to say,
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.960]   we love this phone charge you've made.
[00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.040]   We're not wild about the syriffs on the logo in your company.
[00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:02.760]   Now, we can hook you up with somebody.
[00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:07.640]   But I know designer Rene Ritchie, you know, this is--
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:10.560]   you know, Apple, as well as anybody.
[00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:13.720]   And you know, sort of, like, how they think about things.
[00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.240]   They're apparently also going to be
[00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.280]   reducing the number of third-party products that
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:18.240]   are available in store.
[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.400]   So in addition to giving a helping hand
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.120]   with the designs of the packaging,
[00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.520]   they're also going to be sort of consolidating down
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.200]   and selling fewer things.
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:29.760]   Are they going to be strong arming companies
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:34.080]   and tell them things like, if you want to be one of those coveted--
[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.520]   get one of those coveted spots in the Apple store,
[00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.840]   we're going to need you to be exclusive in this way
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:40.320]   and to have your price be that way.
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:44.240]   Are they going to be dictating terms for the companies
[00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:46.600]   that are lucky enough to be in Apple stores?
[00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:49.040]   I mean, we've had this before with Target and Walmart
[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:52.040]   and Best Buy who get exclusive versions of this or that release
[00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.080]   and exclusive products.
[00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:55.720]   It's not by any means rare in the retail world.
[00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:58.440]   I would just argue that often Apple's incentives
[00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:00.880]   are different than a lot of other companies.
[00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:03.120]   What's really interesting is, like, for example,
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:05.520]   Apple cares about the opening and the packaging experience.
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.120]   They want you to be able to pick up a plug,
[00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.520]   pull this little plastic tab, and the whole thing just opens up
[00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.240]   in front of you where other packaging,
[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.600]   you can get a jackhammer and barely make a dent in it
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.280]   in your frustration level stores.
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:17.200]   So sort of those things that they really care about.
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:18.280]   And as you mentioned, they're going
[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.000]   to reduce the amount of products in there.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.200]   So they want to make the ones that they have in the store
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.560]   sort of really fit their principles, which
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.960]   is the recyclability, which is the minimalism.
[00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:30.400]   And that sort of thing is absolutely controlling.
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:31.880]   But when you look at it, it's the sort of things
[00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:34.960]   that Apple doesn't control that often annoy us more,
[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:38.480]   like AT&T's signal quality or FedEx's delivery schedule
[00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:40.720]   or trying to open that iPhone case package
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:43.320]   that we bought at the Apple Store and isn't is easy to open.
[00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:44.880]   So yes, it's absolutely controlling.
[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:47.280]   No, it's not really different than what any other major retailer
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:47.600]   does.
[00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.560]   It's just the things that Apple cares about
[00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:51.960]   because they have so much money and so much power.
[00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:53.920]   And user experience is higher on their list
[00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:56.640]   than it is some other retailers or manufacturers
[00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:58.640]   because they can afford to have it higher on the list.
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:00.440]   And it's a priority for them.
[00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:01.200]   It remains to be seen.
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:02.840]   I think it will be a consumer benefit.
[00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:05.200]   And we'll have to see if the lack of sort of--
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:07.720]   if it's too much of a burden for manufacturers
[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:10.280]   or the lack of variety as a detriment.
[00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:13.400]   Well, speaking of Apple's money and power,
[00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:16.280]   apparently the FTC is exploring Apple rules
[00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:18.840]   for streaming music rivals in the Apple Store.
[00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:21.920]   Apparently, they 30% cut that they
[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.720]   take for streaming music subscriptions.
[00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:26.240]   If you buy that from the app, in most cases,
[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:27.600]   you don't have to buy it in the app.
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:28.320]   People don't know that.
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.720]   They don't know you can go to the website, Spotify,
[00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:31.560]   or whatever and sign up.
[00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:34.280]   But if you sign up for a subscription in the app,
[00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:35.840]   Apple gets chunk of that.
[00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:39.040]   And that creates a problem for their competitors.
[00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:42.120]   Now that Apple has Apple music, they're
[00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:44.960]   at kind of the competitors to Apple music
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:47.480]   are at a disadvantage because they have to pay Apple.
[00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:50.480]   That means they can either raise their prices
[00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:54.280]   so that they're costing more than $9.99, more than Apple music.
[00:08:54.280 --> 00:09:00.720]   Or they can just lose money or make less money and so on.
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:05.000]   Jeff John Roberts, do you think that this sort
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.760]   of investigation or whatever has merit?
[00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:11.440]   Is Apple going to be prevented from charging what they charge
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:16.160]   for streaming music downloads to get the 30% cut?
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:17.440]   I really doubt it.
[00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:19.800]   I was a little puzzled by this because--
[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:22.360]   I think the regulators might be on their high horse a bit
[00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:25.840]   because to prove antitrust in America, at least,
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:29.520]   you have to show harm to consumers, not harm to competitors.
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:32.440]   While this does hurt Spotify and stuff,
[00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:34.920]   there's not Apple something like Game in Town.
[00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:36.840]   You can also get Spotify through Google Play
[00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:38.600]   and from the website.
[00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:41.640]   And the only other reason you can sort of go after them
[00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:45.040]   is for deceptive or unfair trade practices.
[00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:47.800]   And I don't see how this is that because Apple has always
[00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:48.440]   done this.
[00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:49.280]   Everyone knows it.
[00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:51.520]   And news publishers, anything else.
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:54.080]   This is how Apple's always operated.
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:55.600]   So I'm a little puzzled.
[00:09:55.600 --> 00:10:01.000]   We're having some audio problems on your audio, Jeff.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.880]   I think this is covering up the mic with his hands,
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:03.320]   possibly.
[00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:04.720]   Yeah.
[00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:08.120]   OK, so we'll figure that out.
[00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:11.160]   Andy or Richie, you guys have any comments on this, do you think?
[00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:13.480]   There's one thing that people have been confused by this
[00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:13.920]   from the start.
[00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:16.200]   And it seems blatantly unfair on the surface.
[00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:18.160]   But one of the things that I try to do
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:19.200]   is look at repercussions.
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:21.440]   So when Apple moved to the agency model
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:23.480]   and we started doing things like in-app purchases
[00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:25.480]   and having web subscription services,
[00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:28.200]   one of the problems with this is if there is no fee or even
[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:30.440]   a reduced fee, it incentivizes companies
[00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:32.400]   to move transactions out of the app store.
[00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:36.880]   So for example, if Apple only took a cut of paid apps,
[00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:38.520]   then almost any app maker who could
[00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:39.720]   would switch to in-app purchases
[00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:42.280]   because they would have to give no money to Apple.
[00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:43.680]   If they didn't take a cut of subscriptions,
[00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:46.480]   even if they were web-based, almost every merchant who
[00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:48.160]   could would switch to web-based subscriptions
[00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:50.480]   or subscriptions in an app that didn't have a cut.
[00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:53.040]   So the actual money that Apple made from the app store
[00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:54.000]   would plummet.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.920]   Now, Apple's a rich company, so maybe they don't need this money.
[00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:59.600]   But when you think about free-to-play games,
[00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:02.320]   for example, Candy Crush or Clash of Clans,
[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:04.000]   Apple gets no money off the purchase of those games
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:04.960]   because they're free.
[00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:06.720]   But those games make millions of dollars
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:08.440]   through in-app purchases.
[00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:10.680]   Netflix is a different model.
[00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:11.920]   And to be clear, they don't make money
[00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:13.280]   off actual physical goods.
[00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:14.440]   Like if you order something from Amazon,
[00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:15.560]   there's no price sharing.
[00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:17.200]   It's just digital goods.
[00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:19.040]   But we're moving to a new age where there are so
[00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:21.760]   many subscription services and there are things that maybe
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:23.200]   like we heard rumors in the TV industry,
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:25.560]   they'll have to negotiate a different rate
[00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:27.360]   because there really isn't a lot of room
[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:28.320]   for multiple middlemen.
[00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:30.360]   You can have Amazon in the middle or Apple in the middle
[00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:32.600]   or Netflix in the middle, but having multiple of them,
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:35.600]   there starts to not be enough money to go around.
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:39.040]   Yeah, but this is another one of these sort of consumer
[00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:40.120]   facing problems.
[00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:42.320]   There's so many apps, like the Comixology app,
[00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:45.280]   like the Amazon app, that are so much harder to use on iOS
[00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:47.120]   than the R&Droid because in Android,
[00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:49.360]   you can simply press a button and buy whatever you want
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:50.960]   within the app.
[00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:54.440]   And the idea that every one of these businesses
[00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:58.520]   has enough profit in every purchase to be able to hand over
[00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:04.360]   30% of everything to Apple for reasons that are kind of dubious.
[00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:07.680]   I mean, it's kind of hard to justify in the case of
[00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:12.040]   Comixology that Apple is helping Comixology to sell comics,
[00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:13.880]   given that they're having nothing to do with the store
[00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:14.560]   experience.
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:16.200]   I really think this is something that Apple's going to need
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:16.720]   to revisit.
[00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:20.160]   And I'd really think that at least the idea of taking 30%
[00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:24.360]   off of every app and forcing app makers to really
[00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:27.480]   drive consumers out of this really nice store experience
[00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:29.800]   and into a website, I really think I'm going to revisit that
[00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:35.160]   because it really is making the iOS devices much more
[00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:37.360]   difficult to use.
[00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:40.160]   Well, and again, this is still all under the umbrella
[00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:42.800]   of Apple's wealth and power.
[00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:46.680]   And I think the biggest example of that that I've ever seen
[00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:49.600]   was a story that hit the Wall Street Journal today.
[00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:52.360]   And the story basically is that Apple's share
[00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:58.920]   of the industry profits for the smartphone have risen from 65%
[00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:05.680]   in the first quarter of last year to 92% for the first quarter
[00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:06.440]   of this year.
[00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:10.320]   Apple, one company, is making 92% of the industry's profits.
[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:15.000]   This is incredible.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.480]   How do they do it, Renee Richie?
[00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:18.840]   They made a bigger screen phone.
[00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:22.240]   I mean, if you look at the 65% was because Apple only
[00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:24.080]   made phones that were 4 inches and under.
[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:26.440]   And all the remaining profit industry was mostly made
[00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:29.360]   by Samsung who offered larger than 4-inch phones.
[00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:31.840]   And that meant that the minute Apple made a larger than 4-inch
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:33.960]   phone, they were going to take profit away from Samsung.
[00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:36.400]   Might have been 1%, might have been significantly more.
[00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:38.120]   It turns out it's significantly more.
[00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:41.480]   And Apple is now selling a lot of premium phones.
[00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:43.640]   They also completely avoid the budget phone
[00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:46.560]   or the low end phone market, which can be break even,
[00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:48.080]   can be minimally profitable.
[00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:50.240]   But when you look at most of Apple's competitors,
[00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:53.120]   even Samsung now, which we'll talk about later,
[00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:54.520]   they're not making any money.
[00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:57.240]   So the combination of Apple exclusively focusing
[00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:00.680]   on the premium market and the intelligence of Tim Cook
[00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:03.680]   and Jeff Williams and the operations team, frankly,
[00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:05.800]   with their supply chain, a lot of their sticks,
[00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:09.320]   those phones are incredibly profitable for Apple.
[00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:12.400]   Yeah, there's also the fact that,
[00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:16.240]   although iOS, the iPhone is only about what's 17%
[00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:18.280]   of the phone market right now, there's only one place
[00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:19.280]   you can get them.
[00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:22.720]   So it's very easy to basically, if you're taking a percentage
[00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:25.200]   of every single phone made for a certain operating system,
[00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:28.040]   that also has a role to play.
[00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:31.200]   Also the fact that, as Renee said,
[00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:33.720]   they're not interested in making phones that are not
[00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:37.480]   profitable, which is kind of sad because it means that
[00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:39.960]   there's a reason why at almost every Apple keynote,
[00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:42.080]   China, China, China, China, China, China, China,
[00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:43.080]   China, China, China, look at our China store.
[00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:44.520]   Hey, look, we're just going to be available
[00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:45.760]   in China very quickly.
[00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:48.880]   They're not going to talk about the countries in Africa.
[00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:50.120]   They're not going to talk about India.
[00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:52.480]   They're not going to talk about Pakistan because those people
[00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:54.040]   are not buying premium phones.
[00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:57.680]   So it's an interesting, I mean, it's great that they're making
[00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:59.320]   that they're so profitable.
[00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:01.800]   I don't begrudge them for that, but to me,
[00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:02.760]   that's just a trivia number.
[00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:05.320]   It doesn't have any bearing on what people should do
[00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:06.040]   with their phones.
[00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:09.320]   And do you think they're going to be able to maintain their
[00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:11.400]   China, China, China strategy?
[00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:16.040]   I mean, I think that China's smartphone market is kind of
[00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:18.040]   plateauing to a certain extent.
[00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:22.000]   And we also know that Xiaomi and other Chinese companies are
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.400]   very, very good at offering the Chinese consumers what they
[00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:26.200]   want.
[00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:31.440]   And it just seems like a big part of their more recent surge
[00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:35.640]   toward these kinds of numbers, 92% profits and other numbers,
[00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:41.240]   the fact that they're going to be reportedly building up to
[00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:48.000]   90 million phones this year for their next iPhone device line.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:53.200]   It was because they were struggling in China for a long
[00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:53.520]   time.
[00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:56.800]   I mean, they didn't have China mobile as a carrier, even
[00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:59.040]   though lots of people were bringing phones into China
[00:15:59.040 --> 00:15:59.560]   mobile.
[00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:01.080]   There were other problems as well in China.
[00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:05.760]   And finally, after really chipping away at China for years,
[00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:06.880]   they finally got it right.
[00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:08.080]   And now they're huge in China.
[00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:11.680]   They're building Apple stores as fast as they can in China.
[00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:14.960]   But is that-- so that's a change from not really doing
[00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:17.800]   China right to now doing it right.
[00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:21.320]   Is it going to plateau or do you think that they can sort of
[00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:24.720]   keep up this kind of success rate in China?
[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:26.640]   I think that's largely a Chinese--
[00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:30.240]   how good is the Chinese financial situation right now?
[00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:32.560]   One of the things that makes them so attractive is that a
[00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:35.640]   lot of people with a lot of money and the willingness to make
[00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:37.720]   sure other people know that they have a lot of money.
[00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:41.000]   And one way to express that is I've got this really exotic
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.080]   luxury premium brand phone.
[00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:45.040]   Xiaomi is doing incredible.
[00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:47.320]   There's also a certain point of pride thing going on and that
[00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:50.000]   this is not the thing that came from over there.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.920]   This is the thing that was produced over here to one extent
[00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:54.040]   or another.
[00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:57.000]   But it will never be the sort of premium luxury
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.280]   Western good that Apple is.
[00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:05.560]   Before Apple-- I've been wondering if their difficulty in
[00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:09.080]   getting into China was part of what's helped them out because
[00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:10.440]   it did become this exotic brand.
[00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:14.440]   You had to know somebody to have an Apple phone before they
[00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:15.560]   started getting into China.
[00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:17.280]   And I think that's one of the reasons why if you went to
[00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:21.440]   one of the Chinese counterfeit markets in a major Chinese
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:25.160]   city, you would see just like booth after booth with Chinese
[00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:28.600]   knockoff phones of iPhones.
[00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:31.760]   Not just the ones that are perfect copies of the iPhone 3
[00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:33.600]   and the iPhone 4 and that sort of stuff.
[00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:36.640]   I'm talking about flip phones that have an illuminated Apple
[00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:39.760]   logo on the back where it's not about fooling people in
[00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:40.680]   think you have an iPhone.
[00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:44.160]   It's that I've got something with this beautiful luxury brand
[00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:46.520]   logo on it that I would like to associate myself with.
[00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:48.040]   I don't think that they're going to find the bottom of that
[00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:49.040]   well anytime soon.
[00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:52.320]   But I do think there's going to have to be a time where, for
[00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:55.360]   one of several reasons, they're going to have to start
[00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:58.560]   making phones for people who do not have an almost unlimited
[00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:01.160]   supply of money to spend on luxury goods.
[00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:03.520]   To Andy's point, I mean, when Tim Cook was talking about the
[00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:05.960]   amount of people switching from Android to iPhone, a lot
[00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:06.960]   of that was in China.
[00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:09.600]   And forgive me, I forget who posted the numbers.
[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:11.360]   But when you saw how many people were planning to switch
[00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:13.040]   from iPhone to Android, it was single digit.
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:16.200]   But to switching from Android to iPhone was high double
[00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:16.840]   digits.
[00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:19.880]   And that was what Apple was using to sort of build out their
[00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:22.440]   strategy for China is that there are still a lot of people
[00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:24.960]   who may not make the iPhone their first phone but want to
[00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:26.480]   make it their next phone.
[00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:28.000]   >> Great point.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   Well, we got a whole bunch of great stories coming up in
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:31.560]   just a sec.
[00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:35.120]   But first, let's take a break and let's talk about backup.
[00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:38.880]   One of the fundamental laws of reality for anyone who uses a
[00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:42.200]   computer is that you have to not only backup your data, but
[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:44.200]   you have to back it up in the cloud.
[00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:46.840]   Lots of people, we've all heard the stories about somebody who
[00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:49.160]   backed up locally on a local hard drive.
[00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:52.000]   Everything got damaged or stolen or whatever.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.480]   And they lost everything.
[00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:56.800]   And I think we've all, I doubt that anybody watching this
[00:18:56.800 --> 00:19:00.240]   program has ever gotten through to this point in their life
[00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:02.720]   without losing some data in one way or another.
[00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:05.360]   Carbonite is the leading way and the best way and the
[00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:07.400]   easiest way to back up to the cloud.
[00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:08.520]   And here's why.
[00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:12.200]   You install it and it intelligently goes right to work
[00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:13.440]   backing up your files.
[00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:14.800]   You can go in and fine tune it.
[00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:17.280]   It's very smart about identifying which are your data
[00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:19.440]   files and which are files that you don't need to back up,
[00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:22.120]   things that are associated with applications and so on.
[00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:24.440]   And then you just basically can go in there and tweak it and
[00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:26.160]   say, you know what, I don't want to back up this folder.
[00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:29.920]   I don't want to back up these two files in this folder.
[00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:32.240]   I do want to back up this other folder and I even want to
[00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:35.280]   back up this application folder and everything in it.
[00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:38.360]   And you can just fine tune exactly what gets backed up.
[00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:41.240]   And then it keeps you notified of what's going on with
[00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:42.240]   your backup.
[00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:44.320]   It'll tell you, for example, that you haven't backed up in a
[00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:45.880]   while if there's some kind of glitch.
[00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:49.960]   If you want to pause the backup, it's on a little tiny icon at
[00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:50.840]   the top of your screen.
[00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:53.040]   You just tap on that and say, you know what, pause this for
[00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:54.240]   24 hours.
[00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:58.000]   Instantly, it pauses and then you don't have that process
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   running even though it's such a light process, generally speaking.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.320]   But if you don't want to be using your internet connection
[00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:06.400]   for backing up or whatever, you can do that.
[00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:09.400]   It's such a fantastic application.
[00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:13.680]   You have to use Carbonite and here's the thing with losing data.
[00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:17.360]   You really regret it when you didn't back up correctly.
[00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:20.720]   And you basically can never tell when something is going to
[00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:23.160]   happen where you're going to wish you had a backup.
[00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:26.920]   And of course, with Carbonite, it's also very handy for you to
[00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:31.240]   retrieve files because you can use the app that they offer, the
[00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:33.680]   mobile app and just get access to all of your files from
[00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:35.960]   anywhere through your mobile device.
[00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:38.480]   So it's really, really great.
[00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:41.840]   You can protect your business, your home, no matter what you
[00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:44.480]   are doing with your data, you need to make sure that you
[00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:49.600]   back up and join the 70,000 businesses that trust Carbonite,
[00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:54.120]   the 1.5 million customers who trust Carbonite for around
[00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:56.280]   the clock protection of their files.

[00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:09.000]   Thank them for their support of TWIT.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.480]   Well, Google, speaking of stuff that happens in the
[00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:15.680]   background that's very sophisticated, Google, announced
[00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:22.320]   this week that they are now hitting a 99.9% success rate
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:25.160]   in filtering spam.
[00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:26.160]   How do they do this?
[00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:27.480]   This is almost miraculous.
[00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:30.120]   In fact, for a long time, I mentioned this on TNT this
[00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:31.960]   week.
[00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:34.440]   They caught most of everything in their spam filtering.
[00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:36.040]   It's always had a good reputation.
[00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:39.240]   But they couldn't get the Dr. Oz spams.
[00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:41.640]   The ones that were telling me that I was overweight and
[00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:43.960]   needed to change my diet and all that kind of stuff.
[00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:46.640]   And then three or four months ago, they just completely
[00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:49.720]   saw-- I haven't heard from Dr. Oz since then.
[00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:53.800]   What are they doing that is enabling them to have such a
[00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:56.120]   great success rate in catching spam?
[00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:59.120]   I'll open that up to the group.
[00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:01.720]   Well, I think they're certainly well motivated because
[00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:04.640]   they said, you don't get to send ads to our users.
[00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:07.520]   Only we get to send ads to our users.
[00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:13.120]   But this is another example of why Google is in a unique
[00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:17.080]   position to create services that work really, really well
[00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:17.680]   for its users.
[00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:21.040]   By virtue of the fact of how many users Google actually has
[00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:24.000]   and how much of their behavior they can actually observe,
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.640]   it's not only a deep neural thinking that they've got the
[00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:31.440]   deep nets that they've started making a high marquee feature
[00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:33.120]   of every Google product.
[00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:34.920]   It's always been there, but now they're willing to say,
[00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:37.520]   here's why we can get things working because we have a
[00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:40.680]   deep machine learning understanding of the world around
[00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:41.000]   us.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.560]   But also, they can look at the behavior of other users and
[00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:45.640]   how they are reacting to some of the mail that they're
[00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:48.280]   getting and use that experience to apply to others.
[00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:51.200]   And so it's pretty much as simple as that.
[00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:54.400]   You're never the third person to get a piece of spam.
[00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:57.360]   You're the half a millionth person to have that
[00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:00.440]   bounced off of their inbox.
[00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:02.560]   I think Andy's exactly right.
[00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:04.760]   There are certain things that Google, just as a company,
[00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:06.600]   based on the way they do technology and the way they
[00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:09.680]   think about the internet, is uniquely positioned to solve.
[00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:10.800]   And this is one of those problems.
[00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:13.440]   They have massive experience in sifting through large
[00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:14.920]   amounts of internet data.
[00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:16.920]   They have amazing algorithms, people who are programming
[00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:17.680]   those algorithms.
[00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:19.720]   And they have an incredibly large user pool and they can
[00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:21.080]   watch those behaviors.
[00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:22.920]   And they can use heuristics, but they can also note if
[00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:24.920]   Andy marks something as spam, if Mike marks something as
[00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:27.600]   spam, if I do, more than likely spam.
[00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:29.520]   I'm surprised they didn't get Dr. Oz faster.
[00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:31.520]   Maybe they thought that was ham for a while.
[00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:34.480]   But maybe my subscribe long ago.
[00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:38.160]   But now that because there's so much data going through there,
[00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:40.040]   and when Google talks about machine learning and they talk
[00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:42.280]   about neural networks, this is exactly what that's designed
[00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:43.000]   to solve.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.240]   And I've used Gmail.
[00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:48.880]   I use Apple stuff, but almost all my services, mobile
[00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:50.880]   nations as a company, is all built on Google.
[00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:54.080]   And I've almost never seen spam in my account.
[00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:56.280]   It is close to miraculous.
[00:23:56.280 --> 00:24:00.520]   The other thing, Jeff, that needs to be pointed out is that
[00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:04.280]   spam filtering is really just--
[00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:09.600]   we tend to think of it as a discrete function that email
[00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:13.320]   cloud services provide or that applications can provide
[00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:13.760]   and so on.
[00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:17.760]   But in fact, this machine learning stuff is doing what
[00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:18.440]   Google does.
[00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:19.320]   It's algorithms.
[00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:20.880]   It's learning about you.
[00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:23.480]   And the thing that I find most miraculous about it, Jeff,
[00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:29.840]   is that it's like you know that lots and lots of users are
[00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:30.880]   not using it right.
[00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:34.160]   So somebody might have subscribed to a newsletter.
[00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:38.280]   And then it's just easy to market as spam when they're done.
[00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:41.280]   And yet Google can figure out which--
[00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:44.440]   it doesn't all of a sudden make this newsletter spam
[00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:45.160]   everywhere.
[00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:47.000]   So it's really fantastic.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:54.120]   Do you have any particular anxiety or do you feel fine
[00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:58.960]   about this kind of filtering that's making these decisions
[00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:01.320]   for you about what it's going to show you
[00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:03.320]   and what it doesn't show you?
[00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:07.120]   Not really, because Google is so fantastically good at it.
[00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:08.800]   I suppose you think hard, yes, there
[00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:12.000]   are private simplications or having them think for us
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.120]   or Google Now products.
[00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:16.960]   But I think as long as it's so incredibly good at doing it,
[00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:21.040]   it's the convenience that weighs any sort of sinister motives.
[00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:23.680]   In terms of my issues with Google,
[00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:28.840]   it's anti-spam effectiveness is pretty far down the list.
[00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:31.320]   Well, Google, there's always in the news.
[00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:34.920]   I love covering Google because they just generate so much news.
[00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:35.960]   And I actually find--
[00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:39.160]   I don't know how you Apple specialists do it, Renee,
[00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:42.880]   but because Apple basically announces a whole bunch of news
[00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:43.520]   all at once.
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:46.720]   And then they are just tight-lipped the rest of the year
[00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:49.160]   whereas Google is throwing things out left and right.
[00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:51.320]   And much of it is newsworthy.
[00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:54.800]   But we've also been hearing a lot about Google Glass.
[00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:57.360]   I believe I'm the only glass hole on this panel.
[00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:59.120]   Is that correct?
[00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:00.520]   I like it.
[00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:01.880]   I believe in it.
[00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:02.480]   And--
[00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:03.320]   There goes Andy.
[00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:04.040]   There we go.
[00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:04.640]   All right.
[00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:07.800]   But are you an enthusiast, enthusiastic user?
[00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:10.640]   Or do you have buyers or more?
[00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:13.000]   I certainly don't have buyers or more.
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.360]   I've never been an enthusiastic user
[00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:20.400]   because it's always had that fundamental problem where you're
[00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:23.240]   putting it away for too long.
[00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:26.400]   They will never get around this problem right here, which
[00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:29.200]   is that this is going to be how people
[00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:32.760]   see you when you're running into places.
[00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:36.320]   It means that if I'm in a public place
[00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:40.600]   or a public-ish space like a restaurant,
[00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:42.760]   I really am going to have to take these off and put in my bag
[00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:44.840]   because even if I'm not doing anything with them,
[00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:48.000]   I don't want people to worry that I'm doing something with them.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.880]   But I'm a great admirer of it.
[00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:52.760]   The times where I do use it, I'm really, really happy
[00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:54.280]   that I have it.
[00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:57.520]   And I'm also the beneficiary of Google Glass
[00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:00.400]   as is pretty much everybody who uses Android Wear
[00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:03.440]   because if you're using Google Glass for a year,
[00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:05.520]   you really saw a lot of the thinking
[00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:07.560]   and a lot of the experience that Google picked up
[00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:10.160]   from watching how people are using Glass reflected
[00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:12.320]   in how an Android Wear watch works.
[00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:16.440]   So I'm not in any way remorseful that I actually
[00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:17.280]   that I bought this.
[00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:21.160]   I do use it about a few times a month.
[00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:23.720]   And there are some circumstances when I'm being a tourist
[00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:24.840]   where I will take it with me because I
[00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:27.520]   know that this is the best way to record what I'm doing
[00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:28.280]   while I'm doing it.
[00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:33.400]   And you do use it exclusively for photography and video?
[00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:37.600]   No, it was what I loved about it was the ability
[00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:41.480]   to-- to the first experience I had with it in New York,
[00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:44.200]   after I picked it up at Google in New York,
[00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:47.840]   was still the landmark version of this experience where
[00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:50.200]   I'm taking a nice long walk through Central Park.
[00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:52.560]   And one of the reasons why I take a nice long walk
[00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:55.320]   is that once you basically spin your brain completely down
[00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:58.280]   without any interactions, without any screens,
[00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:02.600]   without anything, it starts to do a deep cook of different thoughts
[00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:04.160]   and different questions you've had on your mind
[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:05.680]   and ideas start coming.
[00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:08.200]   And so the ability to simply, while you're
[00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:09.920]   in the middle of your walk, you have a great idea
[00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:12.280]   or you're reminded of something you want to take care of
[00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:15.200]   and simply saying, OK, glass, take a note,
[00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:17.400]   then you speak the note, and then you're
[00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:19.080]   without stopping, without looking at anything,
[00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:21.720]   without even looking at your wrist, you're on--
[00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:23.800]   you're on and happy.
[00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:26.200]   It's the-- it was the first device that really taught me
[00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:28.240]   how much a phone distracts you.
[00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:29.360]   No matter how much it's helping you,
[00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:33.280]   it's still this thing that still sort of, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:34.280]   Hey, attention to me.
[00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:36.240]   Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:39.840]   And so why don't we just settle that down?
[00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:42.120]   So yeah, I'm very happy that I have it.
[00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:42.600]   Great.
[00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:45.320]   Well, the news that actually happened this week
[00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:47.440]   is a couple of things, really.
[00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:53.600]   One is that the FTC, FCC, it's got to be the FCC.
[00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:58.440]   Google entered a new product that they were kind of vague
[00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:04.520]   about, called the GG1, that supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.
[00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:06.040]   And they were vague about its function,
[00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:09.000]   but it's clearly or very likely to be
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.120]   the first commercial version of Google Glass.
[00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:14.160]   And the second bit of news is that 9 to 5 Google
[00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:18.360]   is reporting that a Google Glass Enterprise Edition, which
[00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:20.920]   has a larger prism, not a smaller one,
[00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:24.120]   and an optional external battery pack.
[00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:27.600]   And this would be for businesses to use, maybe delivery
[00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:30.800]   drivers, people who work for Amazon, whatever.
[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:34.680]   And that makes a lot of sense.
[00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:37.960]   Renee Richie, what are your thoughts on Google Glass?
[00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:40.480]   And also, we know, of course, we've
[00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:42.920]   heard the rumor that Apple would come out with an Apple Watch
[00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:43.640]   for a long time.
[00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:46.440]   Will Apple ever do another type of wearable?
[00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:49.800]   I don't see them ever doing Google Glass type products.
[00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:53.840]   But will they ever do a different wearable besides a wristwatch?
[00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:54.960]   It's a fascinating thing.
[00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:56.480]   And I actually really liked the news
[00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:58.240]   that Google Glass would be coming out with an Enterprise
[00:29:58.240 --> 00:29:59.840]   Edition, maybe not Enterprise specifically.
[00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:02.400]   But I'm going to completely rip off my colleague, Georgia
[00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:04.520]   Dow on this, because she did a great article comparing
[00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:07.520]   the wearable strategies of Google and Apple.
[00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:09.240]   And exactly what I talked about with Gmail,
[00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:11.280]   where they are so smart algorithmically
[00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:13.040]   and in terms of machine learning,
[00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:14.640]   their technology is fantastic.
[00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:16.920]   Their understanding of humanity is not always great.
[00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:19.080]   And psychologically, the original Google Glass,
[00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:21.280]   not a good product, because normal people, even tech
[00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:23.160]   journalists, because we are human beings, too,
[00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:25.200]   walking around with Lakutus Aborg on their face
[00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:27.320]   is just not a great experience.
[00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:30.120]   It sort of intermediates the human process, which
[00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:32.960]   is incredibly based on face and eye recognition and patterns,
[00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:34.960]   and deeply ingrained psychology.
[00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:37.400]   And it just-- it wasn't careful about how
[00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:41.120]   to address that problem, where Apple took their time,
[00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:43.880]   put it on the wrist, which is Rolex and other companies
[00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:46.320]   fought the battle for putting technology on the wrist
[00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:47.000]   decades ago.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.680]   And that was a slow process, but they won the wrist as well.
[00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:51.560]   So it was sort of an incremental increase.
[00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:52.880]   The face is going to take longer.
[00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:55.040]   But I think there's a huge opportunity, like you said,
[00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:57.920]   for Enterprise, for people who are working on things,
[00:30:57.920 --> 00:31:00.840]   people who are maybe fixing cables or server rooms who
[00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:03.640]   can have instructions and information presented to them,
[00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:06.160]   sort of like Microsoft showed off with the HoloLens.
[00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:07.600]   There's this fast opportunity where
[00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:10.760]   you are working on a technical level and not a human level.
[00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:13.000]   I don't want to see my psychologist or my doctor
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:14.400]   wearing this while I'm talking to them.
[00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:16.480]   Maybe when they're operating on me, it's fine.
[00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:19.120]   But when I'm talking to them, I want that human interaction.
[00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:22.280]   But when they're fixing my car or fixing my internet connection,
[00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:23.160]   use all this stuff.
[00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:25.120]   I think it's brilliant.
[00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:25.960]   I do think it's funny--
[00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:27.000]   Can I just jump in for a second?
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:27.400]   Sorry, go ahead.
[00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:28.080]   I'm sorry, Jeff.
[00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:29.080]   Jeff, go ahead.
[00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:30.840]   Yeah, I just got to be the skeptic here.
[00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:33.480]   And I mean, as I guess the norm on the panel,
[00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:36.440]   I can only see Google Glass as a complete failure.
[00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:38.640]   I mean, you haven't heard of it for months.
[00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:41.800]   And Mike, you're a fan of it.
[00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:43.120]   But honestly, in your heart apart,
[00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:44.640]   do you think this is going to catch on?
[00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:46.920]   I mean, it's cool that they can do it.
[00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:49.400]   Like, can you ever see mainstream adoption of it?
[00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:51.680]   Not this, no, not even close.
[00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:56.600]   But I can see all kinds of very-- everything
[00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:59.400]   except mainstream users use it.
[00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:01.320]   For example, you can see this kind of technology
[00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:04.840]   for people scuba diving, or you can see this kind of technology
[00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:07.280]   for all kinds of professionals.
[00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:11.680]   I also believe, very much so, that notifications
[00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:14.480]   inside of eyeglasses, whether there's a camera or not,
[00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:15.840]   that's another issue.
[00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:18.360]   But I do see notifications just--
[00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:20.760]   if you can't tell that a pair of glasses
[00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:23.600]   has the ability to receive and display notifications--
[00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:24.680]   You're getting one right now, aren't you, Mike?
[00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:25.240]   Yes, I am.
[00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:25.600]   I am.
[00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:26.160]   Thank you.
[00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:28.440]   Yeah, and thank you for telling me that in advance
[00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:29.840]   before you're going to say that.
[00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:32.720]   But there's a supreme irony, though, about Google Glass
[00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:35.120]   itself, which actually occurred to me this week.
[00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:37.080]   And I had never really thought of this.
[00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:38.720]   And the irony is this.
[00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:40.680]   The people who hate Google Glass hate it
[00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:44.040]   because there's a camera on it, pointing everywhere.
[00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:46.880]   And the people who love Google Glass love it
[00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:48.920]   because of the camera.
[00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:51.040]   And it does a million things besides the camera.
[00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:53.000]   But most users-- that's why I ask you, Andy,
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:54.560]   whether you just use it exclusively.
[00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:56.920]   Most people who use Google Glass still,
[00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:58.560]   it's just a camera on their face.
[00:32:58.560 --> 00:32:59.800]   That's hands-free.
[00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:03.240]   And if Google ever decided that we're going to just do--
[00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:05.120]   we're going to break out all the Android from this.
[00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:06.520]   We're just going to make it a camera
[00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:08.960]   with Bluetooth LE connection to your phone.
[00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:11.720]   I think that it would be a really popular product.
[00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:15.640]   But getting back to, like, Renee's point,
[00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:21.040]   I would never have guessed that anybody with 10 micrograms
[00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:23.520]   of self-respect would use something that
[00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:25.840]   looks like a selfie stick in public.
[00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:28.200]   And yet, it's got-- in the space of just a year,
[00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:31.920]   it's gone from something that I only see people using outside
[00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:37.320]   in Boston when they are clearly tourists, usually,
[00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:39.680]   from-- that look like they're from Asia, to-- no,
[00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:41.560]   it's everybody that now has them.
[00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:42.720]   So when you offer some--
[00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:44.160]   But it's not a selfie hat, Andy.
[00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:45.280]   It's not a selfie hat.
[00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:45.680]   No, no, no.
[00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:47.640]   Well, that would be even cooler.
[00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:49.840]   You've basically created a brand new product category.
[00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:51.240]   You are a brand influencer, Renee.
[00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:53.920]   You should create this to cause this to come to market.
[00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:58.720]   But I think that if there were a way to get Google Glass
[00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:03.840]   in the form of a $100 to $150 gadget that didn't have
[00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:06.120]   a lot of the social baggage that were attached to it,
[00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:07.400]   I think it would do very well.
[00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:10.680]   Because when I go through my Google Photos stuff,
[00:34:10.680 --> 00:34:12.400]   some of the most compelling video that I shot
[00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:15.240]   is stuff that I would never have shot in a million years.
[00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:16.120]   Again, I'm a tourist.
[00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:17.480]   I'm not at a private function.
[00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:19.640]   I'm not even inside a restaurant or anything like that.
[00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:21.920]   I'm just looking-- I'm just taking a walk through New York
[00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:26.120]   City on December 22 to see the lights at Rockefeller Center.
[00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:28.480]   And because I've got Google Glass on--
[00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:30.440]   and I do have a nice camera on my neck--
[00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:33.680]   but I want to be able to look at this beautiful display
[00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:36.160]   while-- and why don't I just take a recording of this
[00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:37.120]   as I'm watching it.
[00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:39.040]   It's some of the most compelling stuff that I have in my photo
[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:40.040]   and I'm glad that I have it.
[00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:42.120]   So they definitely have something there.
[00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:46.440]   It definitely bears matching that Google never sold this
[00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:47.440]   as a regular product.
[00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:50.320]   It was always-- we are being explicit here.
[00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:52.000]   We don't know if we've got something here yet.
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.360]   The only way we can figure this out is if we actually make it
[00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:56.400]   and then ask the people who want to get it,
[00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:58.080]   how are you using it, what are you liking about it,
[00:34:58.080 --> 00:34:59.880]   what are you not liking about it.
[00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:02.200]   And so on that basis, it was a very, very successful research
[00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:06.040]   project, especially, as I said, as it fed into what Google
[00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:07.440]   Wear eventually became.
[00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:09.800]   But it was an experiment worth doing.
[00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:12.080]   It's not a $1,500 gadget for most people
[00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:14.880]   or even more than weirdos like myself.
[00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:17.760]   But it's definitely worth doing.
[00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:22.040]   I've had a lot of arguments with my fellow journalists
[00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:26.760]   in technology about Google Glass over the couple of years.
[00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:29.840]   And it always went something like this.
[00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:32.360]   The complaint was always that, oh, you're like the Borg.
[00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:38.120]   You're being-- you have the ability to record and take
[00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:39.160]   pictures all the time.
[00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:40.320]   I don't know when I'm looking at you
[00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:42.080]   if you're taking my picture and taking my--
[00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:43.160]   and I always said, no, no.
[00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:45.760]   This is the worst surveillance, secrets of violence device
[00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:48.000]   in history because the whole thing lights up
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:49.640]   when you're recording video.
[00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:51.320]   That's not a bulletproof argument
[00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:53.040]   because in certain conditions, you can't really
[00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:54.520]   tell that it's recording video.
[00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:56.360]   But in most cases, you absolutely can.
[00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:59.480]   And not only-- if you cross the table from somebody talking,
[00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:03.000]   not only can you tell that the person is recording video,
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.160]   you can see the video.
[00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:05.080]   Like, you can watch it.
[00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:06.920]   Like, you can actually see what they see.
[00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:08.840]   You can see their notifications and stuff.
[00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:10.400]   And so I always made that point.
[00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:13.560]   But the journalists, the same journalists
[00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:19.360]   who were so opposed to somebody recording
[00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:22.800]   strangers in public places seemed to me
[00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:27.320]   to be among the most enthusiastic users of Meerkat
[00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:31.040]   and Periscope when these products came in on the market.
[00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:33.520]   And they were Periscoping and Meerkatting everything
[00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:34.360]   in sight.
[00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:37.480]   And I don't know how this is better than this.
[00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:38.200]   I mean, it's--
[00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:39.240]   I'll talk to everything else.
[00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:42.240]   I mean, how many times you've been on the subway and, hi,
[00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:44.360]   I've just listened to in my music.
[00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:46.640]   This is the way I normally hold my phone when I'm listening
[00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:47.200]   to music.
[00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:48.800]   I'm certainly not taking your picture
[00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:51.680]   because you seem to have an interesting facial hair
[00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:53.400]   or anything like that.
[00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:55.680]   I mean, that's a lost argument.
[00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:59.960]   And as you say, I mean, there's a reason why I didn't get--
[00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:01.560]   there's a reason why I wanted to get a-- you
[00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:03.240]   want to get sort of a louder color.
[00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:05.880]   Because it should be very, very obvious that, hey, look,
[00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:07.880]   I'm wearing a device right now.
[00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:10.760]   And I don't want to be doing something that's sneaky.
[00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:11.280]   Yeah.
[00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:12.720]   It's not the technology, though, so much.
[00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:14.720]   It really, to me, is the psychology.
[00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:16.760]   I wear glasses, and there were social stigma attached
[00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:17.760]   to glasses for a long time.
[00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:19.400]   People would call you for eyes.
[00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:20.720]   It's just-- it's one of those things
[00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:23.200]   that the faces are so important to us as human beings,
[00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:25.640]   that if my first experience with you is Mike Elgin's face,
[00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:26.280]   that's one thing.
[00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:28.280]   But if my first experience-- even if I've known you,
[00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:29.200]   we've had dinner many times.
[00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:30.760]   If I see you, and suddenly there's
[00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:33.320]   an unusual-looking piece of technology on your face,
[00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:35.560]   that creates a barrier between our communications.
[00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:36.640]   It's always something I see.
[00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:37.680]   It's a distraction.
[00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:39.960]   It's something that gets in a way of a relationship.
[00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:42.960]   And that's something that very slowly, through seating programs,
[00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:45.240]   maybe like the Explorers program, that as a society,
[00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:47.200]   we have to decide is acceptable.
[00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:48.400]   It's not so much a camera.
[00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:49.960]   People have had problems with cell phone cameras.
[00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:51.360]   They banned them from locker rooms.
[00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:52.120]   They're selfie sticks.
[00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:53.040]   There's what Andy was showing.
[00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:54.280]   All those things are fine.
[00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:56.080]   It's just there's a reason why, in aliens,
[00:37:56.080 --> 00:37:57.840]   there's face huggers and not wrist huggers.
[00:37:57.840 --> 00:38:00.760]   It's something that is very core to our experiences, human beings.
[00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:01.560]   OK, well, look at this.
[00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:03.480]   And those sorts of things really do sort of matter to us.
[00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:06.760]   The alien is not going to ram its overpositor down your wrist.
[00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:07.200]   Come on.
[00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:08.800]   Now you're talking crazy talk.
[00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:15.440]   Hey, but I mean, it's interesting to also think that we--
[00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:17.760]   Renee and I wear different styles of glasses.
[00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:19.920]   I wear this style because I like it.
[00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:23.360]   It hasn't been-- it's just continued by Ray Ban since I bought it.
[00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:25.720]   So now when I break these, I have to buy them off of eBay
[00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:27.200]   because that's how much I like these frames.
[00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:29.200]   It's a conscious choice that this is the sort of thing
[00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:30.440]   that I want to wear.
[00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:32.920]   It's going to be interesting when you also add--
[00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:35.120]   this is a conscious choice that I think enough.
[00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:37.560]   This technology helps me out in so many different ways
[00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:40.520]   that I am willing to have this little bar wrap the top there
[00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:42.360]   and that you're going to have to simply accept the fact
[00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:44.200]   that I've got this on my face.
[00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:47.560]   So it's part of the-- the entire face is your user interface,
[00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:49.720]   including the fact that you might have facial hair, the fact
[00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:52.480]   that you comb your hair a certain different way.
[00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:55.880]   And the fact that I was self-conscious enough
[00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:57.720]   about the Dr. Pepper t-shirt I was wearing
[00:38:57.720 --> 00:39:01.440]   until an hour ago that I did actually find a clean dresser to put on,
[00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:03.080]   it really is all about your user interface.
[00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:05.520]   And everything you do is not necessarily good or bad,
[00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:08.720]   but it's a part of a conscious choice that you choose to make.
[00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:11.360]   So there's another story around Google Glass.
[00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:13.320]   And I was actually not even intending
[00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:15.080]   to talk much about Google Glass today,
[00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:19.240]   but this is actually a very interesting topic, I think.
[00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:25.160]   And that element is that a lot of journalists immediately
[00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:26.440]   said it was dead.
[00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:28.680]   This is-- as soon as Google made the announcement
[00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:32.080]   that they're closing the Explorer program
[00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:35.920]   and they're sending it to the productizing process,
[00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:39.640]   the squirrels that run the thing that turn research projects
[00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:42.760]   into actual products, everybody said it was dead.
[00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:46.520]   The exact same announcement was made for Project Tango,
[00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:50.320]   which is a Google project to do indoor mapping with mobile device.
[00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:53.400]   And nobody said that was dead, but they made the exact same announcement.
[00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:55.400]   And now, of course, Google is making noise
[00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:59.040]   that it's really serious about shipping something around Google Glass.
[00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:03.680]   Is the echo chamber too overwhelming these days in the Tech Press
[00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:06.000]   where the Tech Press doesn't like something
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:09.160]   and they can basically spread this misconception?
[00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:12.640]   I mean, Google very specifically said Google Glass is not dead.
[00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:15.800]   We are sending it over to become a real product.
[00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:17.560]   And then everybody said, oh, it's dead.
[00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:18.080]   They're killing it.
[00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:19.120]   They're smothering it.
[00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:21.480]   Is the Tech Press too overwhelming?
[00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:23.080]   I'll start with you, Jeff.
[00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:27.440]   Do you think-- do you see examples like this and other examples
[00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:31.160]   where the Tech Press just spreads this idea that is mostly
[00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:34.280]   just wishful thinking?
[00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:35.040]   I don't think so.
[00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:39.400]   I think when the Tech Press sort of-- people involved in Tech like Tech
[00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:41.920]   know Tech very well and better than most people.
[00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:44.720]   I think they have a capacity frequently to overstate things
[00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:47.200]   and seize onto fads, be it aloe.
[00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:47.640]   Who knows?
[00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:50.480]   Maybe Miracath and Carisco if we do fads too.
[00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:54.120]   But I think when the Tech Press pronounces something over,
[00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:55.040]   they're usually right.
[00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:56.880]   I'm trying to think of an exception or something.
[00:40:56.880 --> 00:41:00.040]   So they came storming back and the Tech peeks were wrong.
[00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:02.240]   I think that's unusual.
[00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:05.480]   And this is an unusual panel too because I think Google Glass
[00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:09.040]   of Files or Glassels were allowed to say that are a minority
[00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:10.240]   within Tech.
[00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:12.440]   And I think the fact that most Tech people
[00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:15.400]   can Google Glass and predict is demise.
[00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:15.880]   I don't know.
[00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:19.600]   I just don't see a comeback route outside of the enterprise
[00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:22.880]   application, which you described.
[00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:23.880]   Interesting.
[00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:26.240]   Well, we're going to come back with some more interesting
[00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:26.760]   stories.
[00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:30.920]   We're going to be talking about encryption.
[00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:32.520]   Government doesn't like it.
[00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:35.400]   And companies like Apple and Google want to provide it.
[00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:37.840]   And so there's a conflict brewing there.
[00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:41.200]   But first, let's talk about Stamps.com, one of our sponsors
[00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:41.480]   today.
[00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:46.600]   Stamps.com will actually save you tons of time, lots of money.
[00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:49.120]   And there's absolutely no reason to not use Stamps.com.
[00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:51.400]   You can get your mailing and shipping done right from your
[00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:52.560]   house.
[00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:55.520]   And you don't have to go to the post office and wait in line
[00:41:55.520 --> 00:42:00.160]   and do all the things that lots of people do for some reason.
[00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:03.040]   The only reason I can think of that a small business owner
[00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:05.120]   would actually go to the post office is because they don't
[00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:06.360]   know about Stamps.com.
[00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:08.280]   That's why I'm glad to tell you about it.
[00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:10.800]   This is a better way to do your mailing.
[00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:14.480]   You can buy and print official US postage for any letter or
[00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:16.800]   package right from your desk.
[00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:20.320]   And even special postage discounts that you can't get at
[00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:24.200]   the post office are available to you as a Stamps.com
[00:42:24.200 --> 00:42:25.280]   customer.
[00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:28.720]   It's just a fraction of the cost of doing it the old
[00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:33.960]   fashion way, the boring way, the time consuming way, the gas
[00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:36.840]   consuming way of driving around, driving to the post office,
[00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:37.840]   and so on.
[00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:40.200]   And you just don't want to have to go to the post office.
[00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:43.640]   And of course, they will send you a scale for you to weigh it
[00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:44.760]   and then you print the thing.
[00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:47.720]   And the mail carrier will take those packages off your hands
[00:42:47.720 --> 00:42:49.440]   right there at your house.
[00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:53.080]   It's a really, really great way to interact with the post
[00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:53.880]   office.
[00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:56.160]   You know who goes to the post office and waits in long
[00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:57.480]   lines?
[00:42:57.480 --> 00:43:01.240]   Other people, not you and me, we need to use Stamps.com
[00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:04.440]   because it's just such a great way to go.
[00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:08.800]   Now right now, you can use our promo code TWIT for this
[00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:09.520]   special offer.
[00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:14.560]   It's a no risk trial plus $110 bonus offer, which includes a
[00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:18.000]   digital scale and up to $55 free postage.
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:18.720]   So don't wait.
[00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:21.040]   Go to Stamps.com before you do anything else.
[00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:23.680]   Click on the microphone at the top of the home page and
[00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:25.640]   type in TWIT.
[00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:28.680]   That's Stamps.com and enter TWIT.
[00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:33.000]   And we thank Stamps.com for supporting the world's greatest
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:35.120]   technology show.
[00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:36.400]   All right.
[00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:39.760]   Well, there's a big conflict brewing and this scares the
[00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:42.960]   living daylights out of me because the FBI and the
[00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:47.840]   Department of Justice are starting to label companies like
[00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:52.320]   Apple and Google as threats to national security, threats to
[00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:55.800]   public safety because these companies offer
[00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:56.240]   encouragement.
[00:43:56.240 --> 00:43:57.960]   Of course, lots of companies offer encrypted
[00:43:57.960 --> 00:44:01.040]   communication, but Apple and Google are two of the big ones.
[00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:04.480]   And Apple and Google have every intention of
[00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:08.600]   continuing to provide encrypted communication.
[00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:11.240]   Where is-- we'll start with you again, Jeff, well, we left
[00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:14.160]   off with you a minute ago, but we'll start with you again.
[00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:15.640]   Where is this headed?
[00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:17.840]   Do you think that the government could actually win this
[00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:21.320]   war and enable force, essentially, force Apple and
[00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:25.240]   Google to provide backdoors in their communications, which
[00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:26.360]   law enforcement could use?
[00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:29.400]   Oh, by the way, so good hackers.
[00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:31.640]   Where do you think this is headed?
[00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:34.440]   I think if that's going to happen, we won't find out about
[00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:34.800]   it.
[00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:38.520]   There might be backdoors already because if the FBI or the
[00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:41.640]   NSA forces that will definitely come with the strongest
[00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:44.120]   gag or you've ever seen.
[00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:47.480]   But for now, I think there's hope for encryption.
[00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:50.160]   I used to feel sort of unbibble into about it, but I don't
[00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:54.000]   like the idea that we're not allowed to communicate in
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:55.280]   encrypted passion.
[00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:55.800]   What next?
[00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:56.920]   They're going to ban locks.
[00:44:56.920 --> 00:44:59.440]   There's all sorts of other things which people have always
[00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:01.600]   used to promote privacy.
[00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:05.160]   And in this case, I think Google and Apple are correct to
[00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:06.480]   stand their ground.
[00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:09.200]   And I think more people are becoming aware that encryption
[00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:11.360]   is a useful and necessary thing.
[00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:14.800]   So-- and I love what Apple did when Ten Cook updated the
[00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:17.960]   iOS system to make it encryption by default.
[00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:19.680]   I don't know how you guys feel about that.
[00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:22.680]   I think the world's ready for encryption.
[00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:27.960]   Yeah, it's a big deal.
[00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:34.160]   And I think that there's a fine line between a
[00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:36.680]   professional, let's say a professional law
[00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:40.680]   enforcement official, who's advocating policies that
[00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:46.960]   enable them to do their job and on the one hand, and also
[00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:50.320]   things that promote what they are supposed to be doing as
[00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:51.080]   their job and the other.
[00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:52.120]   And that's convoluted.
[00:45:52.120 --> 00:45:55.200]   So let me explain that.
[00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:59.040]   Law enforcement, let's just take two things, fighting crime
[00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:02.840]   and preventing terrorist attacks, right?
[00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:04.440]   Encryption does those things too.
[00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:10.160]   So the value of encryption is it promotes safety.
[00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:11.480]   It promotes public safety.
[00:46:11.480 --> 00:46:14.080]   It enables people to not get their stuff ripped off and
[00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:16.640]   have their identities stolen.
[00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:21.160]   And it prevents hackers, industrial espionage from
[00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:24.120]   China and Russia and Eastern Europe and from America, from
[00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:28.320]   anywhere, from coming in and stealing my company secrets.
[00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:33.440]   So there's law-- so what is the answer as it regards to
[00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:36.240]   encryption for law and order?
[00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:40.480]   Is it to give the law enforcement officials the tools
[00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:47.200]   they need for themselves to catch criminals and terrorists?
[00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:50.560]   Or is it to give encryption, real encryption, with no
[00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:53.480]   back doors to the public so that they can protect themselves?
[00:46:53.480 --> 00:46:58.560]   And the other thing that worries me, by the way, is the
[00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:00.440]   law enforcement officials who are speaking out about this
[00:47:00.440 --> 00:47:04.920]   in Congress and elsewhere don't seem to be aware of the
[00:47:04.920 --> 00:47:08.880]   consensus among experts in technology, especially
[00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:12.400]   encryption experts, who say, yeah, you put that back door
[00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:13.720]   and somebody's going to exploit it.
[00:47:13.720 --> 00:47:19.720]   So there's no such thing as a golden key that only the good
[00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:23.920]   guys can use and that the bad guys could never use.
[00:47:23.920 --> 00:47:25.640]   But go ahead, Renee.
[00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:28.280]   I was going to say it's amazing because it would make
[00:47:28.280 --> 00:47:31.000]   law enforcement's job much easier if everyone was required
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.680]   to provide fingerprints or DNA samples.
[00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:36.480]   But in many societies, we've decided that that is far too
[00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:39.440]   great an infringement on privacy and we would rather
[00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:42.600]   law enforcement had to work harder, get warrants, and go
[00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:46.040]   through extra effort rather than just surrendering that
[00:47:46.040 --> 00:47:47.000]   information.
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:49.480]   And this seems like the technological continuation
[00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:51.680]   of that where it would be much easier if there was no
[00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:54.120]   encryption on anything and all data just flowed completely
[00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:56.600]   freely and anybody could look at it, including law
[00:47:56.600 --> 00:47:57.120]   enforcement.
[00:47:57.120 --> 00:48:00.080]   But as a society, a lot of people seem to be deciding that
[00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:00.920]   that is the same.
[00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:04.520]   That's the same sort of personal information that we have
[00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:06.240]   historically wanted to protect.
[00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:07.840]   And that's not true in every country.
[00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:10.120]   And also, it's not true that every country has been above
[00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:12.480]   board and actually said to their people, these are the laws
[00:48:12.480 --> 00:48:13.440]   we want to enact.
[00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:14.400]   These are the reasons why.
[00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:16.160]   And we want your support in enacting them.
[00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:18.720]   Some of them have done them secretly or behind closed
[00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:21.920]   doors or in ways that's actually in conflict with the
[00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:23.120]   laws of the land.
[00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:26.240]   But it seems like we're getting to a point where--
[00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:27.600]   and I don't know how to say this best--
[00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:29.240]   if you look at Twitter sometimes, there's a lot of
[00:48:29.240 --> 00:48:31.560]   really good info-sec people who laugh at what the
[00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:35.800]   government or even pro hacking companies consider
[00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:37.680]   info information security.
[00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:39.920]   They're not particularly considered to be very good at it.
[00:48:39.920 --> 00:48:42.080]   The methods that you use aren't considered to be very good.
[00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:44.840]   The holes they leave are considered to be egregious and,
[00:48:44.840 --> 00:48:47.280]   like you said, easily exploitable.
[00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:49.480]   And it seems like this is an area where you don't want
[00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:52.160]   people who do not deeply understand the technology sort
[00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:54.760]   of walking elephant-like through the room tearing
[00:48:54.760 --> 00:48:56.040]   everything apart as they go.
[00:48:56.040 --> 00:48:59.040]   That's not--
[00:48:59.040 --> 00:48:59.240]   Absolutely.
[00:48:59.240 --> 00:48:59.640]   There's true.
[00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:00.760]   Go ahead, Andy.
[00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:05.560]   Well, it's that I've been talking to people in
[00:49:05.560 --> 00:49:09.320]   law enforcement at this local in the state and sometimes
[00:49:09.320 --> 00:49:12.440]   even the federal level off and on about subjects like these.
[00:49:12.440 --> 00:49:13.920]   I think the first time I was talking about talk--
[00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:14.800]   I reached out to--
[00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:17.600]   remember that community was in the late '90s, early 2000s.
[00:49:17.600 --> 00:49:22.520]   And most of the people I talk to have shown the same
[00:49:22.520 --> 00:49:25.440]   attitude, which is that they have a very, very clear
[00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:28.600]   mandate, which is to preserve public safety.
[00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:32.600]   And their attitude is that if they don't exploit every tool
[00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:36.320]   that is legally at their disposal to pursue that mandate,
[00:49:36.320 --> 00:49:40.440]   they are being shamefully derelict in their duties, which
[00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:43.320]   is the reason why they will do things like, well, we're
[00:49:43.320 --> 00:49:47.640]   going to fly helicopters with infrared cameras to see
[00:49:47.640 --> 00:49:49.960]   where there are heat blooms in places where there should not
[00:49:49.960 --> 00:49:50.640]   be heat blooms.
[00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:53.240]   We do not believe we need a warrant to do that because we're
[00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:55.080]   simply observing from a helicopter.
[00:49:55.080 --> 00:49:57.720]   Just like we don't believe that is going to be illegal for us
[00:49:57.720 --> 00:50:01.400]   to put a GPS tracker on someone's car because essentially all
[00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:04.200]   is doing is what a member of law enforcement could do
[00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:06.680]   if they were following this person 24 hours a day,
[00:50:06.680 --> 00:50:09.000]   seven days a week across all kinds of terrain
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:11.520]   without being seen.
[00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:13.560]   But they look for guidance.
[00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:17.200]   Again, this is only according to the impression
[00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:18.640]   I get from people I've been talking to.
[00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:20.200]   They look for guidance from the law.
[00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:22.400]   Then once the law says, you can't do that, they say, OK,
[00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:23.160]   we won't do that anymore.
[00:50:23.160 --> 00:50:25.400]   They're sort of going to lobby to be able to do what they think
[00:50:25.400 --> 00:50:25.960]   they need to do.
[00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:29.800]   But the best way for us to tell law enforcement to knock
[00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:32.880]   something off is for us to tell them to knock it off.
[00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:36.720]   And it's not as though they are always in this position of always
[00:50:36.720 --> 00:50:42.200]   trying to abrade more and more of our security and our freedoms.
[00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:49.040]   There was a really top secret in the sense that we got details of it
[00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:53.680]   later from reporters in England in mid-May, I think,
[00:50:53.680 --> 00:50:56.920]   in which the security people and the legal people from Google
[00:50:56.920 --> 00:50:59.480]   and Apple and government agencies and all kinds
[00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:01.960]   of other corporations and all kinds of other citizens groups
[00:51:01.960 --> 00:51:04.240]   basically got together to talk about these issues
[00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:05.560]   in a very structured way.
[00:51:05.560 --> 00:51:07.520]   And one of the things that came out of that,
[00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:10.200]   according to some of these reports,
[00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:12.840]   is that there was an acknowledgment that the Edward Snowden
[00:51:12.840 --> 00:51:17.000]   leaks as bad as they were for the NSA and other agencies.
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:21.440]   It really did-- it was sort of a wake up call to a lot of these agencies
[00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:27.200]   saying that we can't do our job if people think that we are turning
[00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:29.520]   every single phone in every pocket into a bug,
[00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:32.160]   we need to be more open, we need to be more transparent,
[00:51:32.160 --> 00:51:35.160]   and more importantly, we need to make sure we're not--
[00:51:35.160 --> 00:51:38.840]   we don't lull ourselves into a sense where just because we can do something
[00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:42.440]   means that we should do something and that we need to have the right to do something.
[00:51:42.440 --> 00:51:45.000]   So there's a grounds for a great--
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:48.280]   I feel a great feel for optimism here.
[00:51:48.280 --> 00:51:51.400]   Although, once again, it is our responsibility to tell our people
[00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:54.920]   who keep us safe that here is what the parameters of your job are.
[00:51:54.920 --> 00:51:57.520]   And we can't just-- even if the lawmakers tried to slip something
[00:51:57.520 --> 00:52:03.480]   into a free lunch programs for lower income school children.
[00:52:03.480 --> 00:52:06.040]   And by the way, page 1,000 A of this bill
[00:52:06.040 --> 00:52:11.000]   is that we can basically-- every light bulb is now a wide surveillance network.
[00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:11.640]   Yeah, maybe not.
[00:52:11.640 --> 00:52:12.800]   Think of the children.
[00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:14.160]   We need the surveillance network.
[00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:16.320]   Yeah, and of course, I'm with you, Andy.
[00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:21.600]   And of course, I don't think there's room for panic except for the point
[00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:24.720]   that Jeff made, which is that, yes, I think we can tell
[00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:25.560]   the FBI no.
[00:52:25.560 --> 00:52:27.520]   I think we can tell the Department of Justice no.
[00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:31.680]   I'm not sure we'll be given the choice or the chance to tell the NSA no.
[00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:33.680]   And so I hope that--
[00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:37.480]   I hope the Snowden revelations and all the fallout that's taken place since then
[00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:47.080]   has made the executive branch of government more skittish about allowing stuff like this.
[00:52:47.080 --> 00:52:52.800]   But again, I think Jeff has a great point that this may happen under gag orders and all the rest.
[00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:56.040]   It's for sure that the public's reaction to the Snowden leaks were,
[00:52:56.040 --> 00:52:59.320]   oh my god, this horrible spy is undermining American security.
[00:52:59.320 --> 00:53:03.000]   It's like, holy crap, we had no idea the government was doing this to us.
[00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:04.400]   We have to make them stop.
[00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:09.080]   So that's where my good humor about this comes from.
[00:53:09.080 --> 00:53:10.840]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:53:10.840 --> 00:53:17.680]   Well, Ellen Powell, she resigned this week or was fired or both.
[00:53:17.680 --> 00:53:22.360]   And she was, of course, the interim CEO of Reddit.
[00:53:22.360 --> 00:53:23.680]   I think we've all heard the stories.
[00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:27.640]   Essentially, she was at Kleiner Perkins.
[00:53:27.640 --> 00:53:33.440]   She sued them for sexual harassment and other things.
[00:53:33.440 --> 00:53:37.320]   She ended up being the interim CEO of Reddit.
[00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:44.840]   And she has not been popular with a lot of the Reddit moderators and other active users.
[00:53:44.840 --> 00:53:48.520]   And she inevitably, I think, left.
[00:53:48.520 --> 00:53:50.160]   What was the mistake that was--
[00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:52.760]   I think there was a mistake here made by Reddit.
[00:53:52.760 --> 00:53:55.320]   But I'd like to open this up to the group.
[00:53:55.320 --> 00:53:58.680]   What do you guys think their mistake was in all of this?
[00:53:58.680 --> 00:54:02.520]   I'd like to jump on that in that you showed that, in your Times headline,
[00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:08.040]   I was kind of perplexed by that Times story in that headline screen
[00:54:08.040 --> 00:54:11.400]   that this was a case of sexism and persecution and song.
[00:54:11.400 --> 00:54:16.600]   That story never reported why she was thrown out in the first place.
[00:54:16.600 --> 00:54:22.360]   And I think an incredible amount of vitriol and sexism or racism poured out around her.
[00:54:22.360 --> 00:54:24.880]   There was also the case that a lot of people, like, wait a minute,
[00:54:24.880 --> 00:54:27.000]   they put the wrong person in there to do this job.
[00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:30.680]   And they tried to commercialize Reddit in a clumsy fashion.
[00:54:30.680 --> 00:54:34.160]   So that was just before delving into the deeper parts of it.
[00:54:34.160 --> 00:54:38.560]   I was very puzzled and perplexed on how the New York Times framed that.
[00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:40.880]   It would have been fair to do that as analysis after.
[00:54:40.880 --> 00:54:44.880]   But I'd like to sort of dwell and find out why was she fired in the first place
[00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:47.520]   and why did she resign, I should say.
[00:54:47.520 --> 00:54:52.880]   The other inaccurate thing is to basically point out that she fell victim
[00:54:52.880 --> 00:54:56.560]   to a crowd demanding her ouster.
[00:54:56.560 --> 00:54:58.320]   Yeah, a lot of people. She was interim CEO.
[00:54:58.320 --> 00:55:02.560]   In order for her to remain in that job, they would have had to actually hire her.
[00:55:02.560 --> 00:55:06.600]   And usually interim CEOs are not the ones that get hired for the permanent position.
[00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:10.960]   So I thought that that was a little bit much, too.
[00:55:10.960 --> 00:55:12.240]   Renee, you had a point?
[00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:14.600]   Yeah, no, I was just going to say there was a lot of conflation in that story.
[00:55:14.600 --> 00:55:20.720]   But Reddit is an interesting company in that they have a company and a community
[00:55:20.720 --> 00:55:22.440]   that are loosely coupled.
[00:55:22.440 --> 00:55:26.120]   There's no direct control over that community.
[00:55:26.120 --> 00:55:30.320]   That community is mostly run by volunteer moderators and by the community itself.
[00:55:30.320 --> 00:55:34.920]   And then there's this business on top of it that's trying to figure out how to make money off of all of this.
[00:55:34.920 --> 00:55:38.720]   But they, like several other companies in recent history,
[00:55:38.720 --> 00:55:43.560]   have shown very little understanding of the dynamics involved in a community.
[00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:45.760]   And it looks like the board.
[00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:50.680]   You often go back to the board and I think Chuck made a good point in the articles in the show notes for that, too.
[00:55:50.680 --> 00:55:57.280]   That it's similar to HP where they hired Leo Apothek or almost without even talking to him first.
[00:55:57.280 --> 00:56:01.720]   And I'm sure they spoke to Ellen Powell, but it just seems like the way the business was run
[00:56:01.720 --> 00:56:09.280]   after having her as interim CEO had very little in terms of savvy understanding or strategic preparedness
[00:56:09.280 --> 00:56:11.360]   for running a community like Reddit.
[00:56:11.360 --> 00:56:15.840]   She engaged not with the community at all as far as has been reported,
[00:56:15.840 --> 00:56:21.120]   but mostly with other business units and with media and with stakeholders who were entirely divorced
[00:56:21.120 --> 00:56:24.120]   from a community site like Reddit.
[00:56:24.120 --> 00:56:28.000]   And these things, I mean, Reddit is huge, but dig used to be huge and slash dot used to be huge.
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:32.960]   And communities are migratory and they are almost like this magical thing that bubbles up
[00:56:32.960 --> 00:56:34.720]   when you have this efficient ingredients.
[00:56:34.720 --> 00:56:36.320]   And that's highly volatile.
[00:56:36.320 --> 00:56:41.320]   And this just, it did not look like a successful match was made here at all.
[00:56:41.320 --> 00:56:47.720]   Yeah, it was also kind of curious when you saw her official release on why she left one of them being that
[00:56:47.720 --> 00:56:56.120]   the owners of the corporate owners base were demanding that she create new levels of user.
[00:56:56.120 --> 00:57:00.360]   And she had increased the user base by certain present and that goal was not met,
[00:57:00.360 --> 00:57:08.600]   which in and of itself is like, wow, you're you're basically, you know, you're basically creating a situation
[00:57:08.600 --> 00:57:15.000]   where someone has to grow an online community that's sole strength as people being attracted to it,
[00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:16.800]   not being pushed into it.
[00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:22.720]   I mean, it's I have to admit that this was a story where I kept trying to dig more and more and read more and more
[00:57:22.720 --> 00:57:26.600]   about it to understand exactly where the failure points were.
[00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:31.040]   The only thing that's easy to understand is that once there was blood in the water,
[00:57:31.040 --> 00:57:38.280]   hey, female CEO, let's go get her, which is which I don't think is the tone of Reddit overall.
[00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:44.200]   But unfortunately, there is that there is that percentage that all you got to do is point someone
[00:57:44.200 --> 00:57:47.640]   toward that target and that target will then decide that this is not worth it.
[00:57:47.640 --> 00:57:53.000]   It means it's a make becomes a challenge for that person to execute the duties of their job.
[00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:59.400]   And there's just it's just a long list of sad tales that are that are around the story of some of which are
[00:57:59.400 --> 00:58:04.120]   commercial, some of which are based on investors, some which are about the nature of communities
[00:58:04.120 --> 00:58:09.480]   to simply form around whatever locus that community has decided is going to be the meeting point.
[00:58:09.480 --> 00:58:12.440]   And unfortunately, there is sexism and mixed in there too.
[00:58:12.440 --> 00:58:18.360]   There certainly is. And of course, one of the websites that have benefited greatly from all
[00:58:18.360 --> 00:58:24.360]   the controversy around Reddit and also the banning of I think it was eight subreddits recently,
[00:58:24.360 --> 00:58:32.120]   Ellen Powell did that as well banning subreddits that were fomenting physical threats, threats of
[00:58:32.120 --> 00:58:36.840]   violence actually. They weren't shutting down offensive things. There are many, many offensive
[00:58:36.840 --> 00:58:42.280]   subreddits still on on Reddit. But lots of people said, okay, I don't want to be in a site where
[00:58:42.280 --> 00:58:47.880]   there's censorship. So I'm going to go to vote. I believe it is is V O A T. Is that is that how
[00:58:47.880 --> 00:58:53.800]   you say it? Have any of you tried this website, this Reddit alternative?
[00:58:53.800 --> 00:58:59.880]   I never heard of it till I think Addy at the birds or somewhere wrote a good piece on it.
[00:58:59.880 --> 00:59:03.800]   But I think she qualified and said there's not that many people on it. If you really want a
[00:59:03.800 --> 00:59:08.360]   forum to make fun of fat people or colored people or something, I guess that's where you
[00:59:08.360 --> 00:59:12.440]   can go. But there's always going to be these dark corners of the internet. And I think it's
[00:59:12.440 --> 00:59:16.920]   getting us for the five minutes of fame. But I'm not sure it's really going to catch on as a
[00:59:16.920 --> 00:59:23.160]   mainstream thing. Although I think it was, as someone just said, online communities are migratory
[00:59:23.160 --> 00:59:28.040]   and will be interesting. We see a dig style effect and everyone going somewhere else would be both.
[00:59:28.040 --> 00:59:32.440]   I'd be surprised. But I guess there's there's an opportunity now if someone can get that
[00:59:32.440 --> 00:59:37.080]   critical mask to migrate, that'll be really interesting. Yeah, it's also interesting to me that Victoria
[00:59:37.080 --> 00:59:41.080]   Taylor was one of the instigating events for this. Like there are other reasons, but Victoria Taylor's
[00:59:41.080 --> 00:59:45.080]   firing was was one of the participating events for this. And she's also female in the communities
[00:59:45.080 --> 00:59:51.960]   really rallied around her. So there's absolutely all forms of of diversity problems in online
[00:59:51.960 --> 00:59:55.720]   communities. But to me, like, I don't know how much the board uses Reddit. I don't know how much
[00:59:55.720 --> 01:00:00.120]   Ellen Palley's Reddit, maybe a lot. But based on the behavior, it doesn't seem like that much.
[01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:05.000]   And it's hard to imagine a company where Steve Jobs doesn't use the iPhone or Larry Page doesn't
[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:09.480]   use Google search. And unless you have people who are deeply enmeshed in the product that you're
[01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:14.440]   making, there's always going to be incredible room for things like this to happen. And I think
[01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:18.440]   in order for there to be change, it can't just be an interim CEO. It has to be a board and a CEO
[01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:21.960]   who is deeply part of this community, understands it at a very deep level.
[01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:27.880]   Yeah, I mean, there's there's a saying that usually used to complain about ineffective
[01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:33.880]   politicians that but it's actually spot on for how best to lead a group like Reddit.
[01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:37.560]   The saying goes, oh, they're they're going my people. I must find out where they're going so that I
[01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:43.720]   can lead them. If you basically have to let people do what they're going to want to do. And they
[01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:48.600]   the shape that that group forms will tell you what kind of container you need to build for them
[01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:53.560]   to both help them make this place that they've discovered into something that's even more tuned
[01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:57.240]   to their needs. And also, of course, steer it towards a way that you can actually make money
[01:00:57.240 --> 01:01:03.080]   for yourself and for your investors. The problem is that a site like Reddit is going to be is going
[01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:08.520]   to be hitting its head against harder and harder walls as a code because the reason why it got as
[01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:14.280]   big and as useful and as attractive as it was was because it really was any topic you can create
[01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:18.840]   a subreddit about it. You can create a discussion for me and you can attract like minded like
[01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:25.080]   minded people toward it with not a whole lot of oversight, which means that a lot of the most evil
[01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:30.760]   forms of communication were in some of these Reddit subgroups. And guess to the point where if you
[01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:37.000]   want to you don't no longer have the ability to say, you know what, I really have a problem
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:43.080]   with my company helping people discuss how we should shame a certain group of people into hating
[01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:47.480]   themselves and doing themselves harm. I think that of all the three, I'm really cool with the
[01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:53.960]   Marvel Comics subreddit, the subreddit about Moto 360. Great love it. But let's see if we can create
[01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:59.320]   we can not be responsible for for hate groups and for people are doing just really, really awful
[01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:04.840]   things. But then you don't have the ability to really do that anymore because it's just not the
[01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:09.320]   nature that it's not the shape of the container that you have built. And by the time you want to
[01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:14.120]   start to inflict some order and control and improve your service that way, you're changing it and
[01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:18.360]   sort of tearing it apart. And basically you're sending people out to find some find some other
[01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:23.160]   place to go. So I really don't know what the answer to that is. I mean, I think that what most
[01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:28.040]   people want the people who are most valuable as users want is moderation. They want a certain
[01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:32.280]   amount of they want to enter into place where they know that there's a certain degree of safety
[01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:37.160]   and security. And sites like Reddit are going to have have a harder, harder, harder time creating
[01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:42.360]   that environment for those users. And one of the places where they may have gone is over to the
[01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:48.760]   Verge. Verge had a bad experience. And on July 6th, editor in chief, Niele Patel,
[01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:54.440]   announced that they were shutting off comments on stories. They kept their forums open, but their
[01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:59.560]   comments on stories were being shut down temporarily while they regroup. And they're going to come back
[01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:05.320]   and have them be selectively on and so on. In any event, this reminds me of popular science,
[01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:12.440]   which shut down comments a few years ago. Lots of places have turned off comments because trolls
[01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:20.120]   and haters and racists and sexist and all kinds of people who are, say, really horrible things,
[01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:25.240]   people making threats and so on, you know, ruin it for everybody. And what do you think about their
[01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:29.480]   decision? We'll start with you, Jeff. What do you think about their decision to shut off
[01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:36.280]   comments? Was that the right response to a horrible week of trolling? I get it because as a journalist,
[01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:40.520]   there's two contradictory instructions. It's like, make it a good community, make people happy,
[01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:44.840]   make it nice. And then it's also like engage people, engage your audience, be certain gauging.
[01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:49.480]   You can't have those without the trolls. They'll find you, they'll get in there. And it becomes a
[01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:54.040]   question of resources. I mean, suppose you can have 10 people. How many are you going to allocate
[01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:58.680]   to taming the trolls? It might be one people, two people. Certain point it gets expensive,
[01:03:58.680 --> 01:04:04.840]   it gets, you know, exasperating and exhausting. And then it's just easier to go, okay, enough of
[01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:08.920]   this. Let's pull the plug. And I think that's probably what the Verge is doing right now.
[01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:17.960]   Andy, what do you think? Is this, are we going to see even more of this coming out? Because again,
[01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:23.960]   every time you shut off an avenue for trolls, they, those remaining trolls will find another
[01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:27.640]   place, which makes that other place worse, which causes a new crisis at that other place.
[01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:32.760]   What do you think, where do you think this is going in terms of a phenomenon online?
[01:04:32.760 --> 01:04:37.000]   I think that we're going to find that a lot of people who are responsible for creating content
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:40.600]   are no longer going to want to be responsible for creating the forums where people talk about
[01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:45.240]   that content. There are a lot of journalists who feel as though that is a critical part of
[01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:50.680]   what makes did online publication so important that you not only do your reporting or do your
[01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:54.520]   editorial, but you also have a conversation with those people who are reading it. That's great.
[01:04:54.520 --> 01:05:00.840]   That's a great principle. But you have time to create new journalism, or you have time to moderate
[01:05:00.840 --> 01:05:05.160]   this, what can be a very, very active and very, very contentious place. And like I was saying a
[01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:09.480]   minute ago, you don't want to be responsible for creating a place where people can say,
[01:05:09.480 --> 01:05:15.080]   any fat chicks should just go kill themselves right now. I can't stand those blankly blanks
[01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:19.320]   who live in this part of the country. They're all, and I think they should all shoot themselves
[01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:23.080]   right now. You can't delete those comments fast enough and you're shocked that those things were
[01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:27.400]   up for even the 15 minutes while you were trying to copy edit and post something brand new.
[01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:33.080]   It's such a simple solution to simply go into WordPress, flip one switch and turn off comments.
[01:05:33.080 --> 01:05:37.720]   And now your life gets so much easier and so much better. And if somebody complains about it,
[01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:42.360]   you can say, here is my Twitter handle, by all means direct comments to me on Twitter, or
[01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:48.120]   here are any of any of any other places online where you can create your own, your own board for
[01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:53.560]   discussion, or participate in here. I'm perfectly, I'm not perfectly okay with seeing people saying
[01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:57.080]   whatever they want to say, wherever they want to say it. But I don't have to turn,
[01:05:57.080 --> 01:06:00.120]   keep the lights on in the room where they get to say that sort of stuff. I used,
[01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:05.400]   before I turned off comments of my own blog, I used to have a saying that I love the First
[01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:09.720]   Amendment. I love freedom of speech so much that I purchased exclusive rights to freedom of speech
[01:06:09.720 --> 01:06:15.160]   on an outgo.com. And you are welcome to also purchase exclusive rights to freedom of speech
[01:06:15.160 --> 01:06:18.120]   on your own forum, because that's God bless America.
[01:06:18.120 --> 01:06:22.760]   Yeah, exactly. And Renee Ritchie is anonymity, the problem here.
[01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:28.840]   Yeah, so I'll just preface this by saying that we have both forums and comments on IMO.
[01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:33.400]   We've got about 10 million monthly readers on IMO, about 37 million on mobile nations.
[01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:38.920]   And we believe deeply in the comment system, because my bosses, they grew up making mobile
[01:06:38.920 --> 01:06:42.360]   communities. In fact, our titles originally were community editors before we got all,
[01:06:42.360 --> 01:06:47.400]   journalistic about it. It was really an online community that's grown up all the content
[01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:51.000]   that we've made. So whenever anyone mentions we should turn off the comments, they all get
[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:56.760]   almost like a visceral defensive nature about it. And we have a lot of moderators and a lot of
[01:06:56.760 --> 01:07:01.800]   volunteers and a lot of paid employees who spend a lot of time sort of, policing's a wrong word,
[01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:06.120]   but sort of making sure it's a good experience because you could have a great article and someone
[01:07:06.120 --> 01:07:10.520]   lands on that article. And it's beneficial for them to read it, but then you hit the comments and
[01:07:10.520 --> 01:07:15.560]   it's a cesspool and it makes them actually not sort of makes you tire experience a negative for them.
[01:07:15.560 --> 01:07:19.480]   And we're really conscious about this. But I think a large part of it is what you've said.
[01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:25.960]   There is that greater internet f-wad theory that anonymity plus internet equals a troll or whatever
[01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:29.480]   you want to call them. But we've seen that when people have Facebook comments on which do
[01:07:29.480 --> 01:07:34.680]   theoretically link to real names or Google+ comments that do theoretically link to real names.
[01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:39.400]   It doesn't really mitigate the behavior. People seem to believe that when they're disconnected,
[01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:44.440]   when they're through a monitor, that humanity no longer exists. And when you do remind them of it,
[01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:47.960]   sometimes they're contrived about it. Sometimes they're not, but there's always someone else who's
[01:07:47.960 --> 01:07:53.000]   just coming on who's angry or upset about something and spewing into the comments is a very easy
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:57.960]   thing to do. So I'm, every time I see like during fireball never had comments, I remember in gadget
[01:07:57.960 --> 01:08:02.840]   turn theirs off, the verge is turning theirs off for a while now, I think about it. And part of me
[01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:08.200]   thinks it's a great solution for every reason that Andy mentioned. And part of me just laments
[01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:12.600]   that there are so many wonderful aspects of the internet that we are increasingly turning off,
[01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:17.000]   just because people routinely misuse them. And I don't know if there's an easy solution to that.
[01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:21.480]   Yeah, I keep thinking about that. I think in the past 10 years, I've only
[01:08:21.480 --> 01:08:29.240]   think of one site that had a beautiful comment system where there were going to be at least a
[01:08:29.240 --> 01:08:33.240]   couple hundred comments on every single one. And almost every single one had something thoughtful
[01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:39.160]   and positive to say. And the author of the post was having an ongoing conversation that was also
[01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:44.920]   beautiful. And that is Roger Ebert.com. And that was Roger specifically investing so much of his
[01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:50.760]   heart and so much of his faith in that the people who are coming to him to read his stuff on his
[01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:56.760]   site are not going to be jerks. And I have close knowledge of how that process went.
[01:08:56.760 --> 01:09:02.600]   And there was very little moderation needed because for some reason you would see this.
[01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:08.360]   You would see this the Sistine Chapel ceiling and you have you have the can of spray paint in your
[01:09:08.360 --> 01:09:15.720]   hand and you say, I don't think I can find another place to spray paint a penis than this wall.
[01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:21.400]   I'll I'll find someplace else where it's it wouldn't seem to be great so much damage, I think.
[01:09:21.400 --> 01:09:24.200]   A simple course to do a side of simcoe seems to be like that too.
[01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:31.160]   I'll add one other side I think as comments well ours technica maybe because the topics are
[01:09:31.160 --> 01:09:36.040]   less esoteric. I mean they're right about fiber broadband and patents and things. But they have
[01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:41.640]   a lot of smart people and the authors participate and they seem to do okay. And one other place is
[01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:48.040]   tech dirt Mike Masnick is still a big proponent of having commenters and still thinks it works.
[01:09:48.040 --> 01:09:51.880]   But otherwise I think overall it's moving the other direction and people are going the way the
[01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:58.280]   verge. Yeah definitely. Well we're going to come back and talk about Facebook and some of the
[01:09:58.280 --> 01:10:03.720]   things that they're up to they're they're definitely out to get Google one way or the other and we'll
[01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:09.960]   be talking about that. But first let's talk about audible.com. Now I have been an audible user since the
[01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:16.520]   year 2000. And in fact on one of the last shows where Regis and Kathy Lee shows in the year 2000
[01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:21.560]   that that Kathy Lee was still on the show I actually came on that show and demonstrated audible
[01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:25.960]   back then it was a physical device because this is before the you know the big iPod revolution
[01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:30.280]   before the smartphone revolution before any of that they actually had to make a player so you
[01:10:30.280 --> 01:10:35.640]   could listen to books. And since then they've gotten better and better and better. And one of the
[01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:44.120]   things that audible has gotten so great at is the actors and the voice of professionals who read
[01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:50.040]   many of these books or better still the authors sometimes read the books. And they are fantastic.
[01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:56.840]   Let me give you an example of something we you know one of the most popular especially on BitTorrent
[01:10:56.840 --> 01:11:04.200]   TV shows is of course Game of Thrones. Okay Game of Thrones is just like anything else that's
[01:11:04.200 --> 01:11:14.520]   goes from a book to a television it loses a lot. The actual book is wonderful and audible.com is a
[01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:19.880]   great great way to consume that book. Can we listen to this and hear what it sounds like?
[01:11:19.880 --> 01:11:27.560]   "The Song of Ice and Fire" by George R.R. Martin read by Roy DeTries. Even his name sounds good when
[01:11:27.560 --> 01:11:35.480]   he reads it. That's unbelievable. Now that is Roy DeTries who's doing the voice acting there
[01:11:35.480 --> 01:11:42.040]   and it is great. Now if you're one of these people who don't like the Game of Thrones because it's
[01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:47.240]   phony history it's not really Europe it's not really the Middle Ages it's kind of they're drawing
[01:11:47.240 --> 01:11:54.600]   from those images and so on. If you want the real thing try Richard III and the ultimate game for
[01:11:54.600 --> 01:12:03.160]   the throne by C. Derby Shire and this is narrated by Daniel Pence. This is actually references the
[01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:11.240]   Game of Thrones because a lot of the kinds of machinations and cutthroat contests for power
[01:12:11.240 --> 01:12:18.040]   during the reign of Richard III of course are just like you know a lot like the TV show but this
[01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:23.720]   is the real deal. Let's listen to a little bit of this. "The Throne of England, the game was harsh
[01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:29.240]   and it was brutal. rival families went to war leaving cousins dead on the battlefield.
[01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:35.560]   Brother fought brother as power corrupted and twisted men's souls." See now that sounds like
[01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:41.400]   entertainment but that all that stuff really happens really really good history. Now I know that
[01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:47.960]   if you listen to Twit you know with you're probably with a smartphone or you may watch it or whatever
[01:12:47.960 --> 01:12:54.920]   you know the value of learning and getting content through the spoken word. Of course books are
[01:12:54.920 --> 01:13:01.320]   stories. Fiction books are stories and for the vast majority of human history stories were an
[01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:08.600]   oral medium. People told stories and since Gutenberg and literacy we now get our stories primarily
[01:13:08.600 --> 01:13:15.800]   through books and but ultimately human stories are supposed to be or at least originally they were
[01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:22.040]   they were an oral medium. A storyteller told you stories Homer for example. We get Homer you can
[01:13:22.040 --> 01:13:28.520]   read it now but for centuries Homer was just something that somebody told you from memory
[01:13:28.520 --> 01:13:35.640]   and this brings you back to that magical experience of being told a story by a great storyteller.

[01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:16.680]   haven't yet. Well Facebook has up to something they they are obsessed with video these days and I
[01:14:16.680 --> 01:14:22.520]   suspect that the main reason is that video advertising is very lucrative they can make a lot of money
[01:14:22.520 --> 01:14:27.800]   off of video advertising but they are apparently talking to the music companies which started a
[01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:32.760]   rumor that they were going to get into a Apple music type of service. They said that they are
[01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:37.160]   not building a streaming service. Okay so that doesn't mean they're not getting into music that
[01:14:37.160 --> 01:14:42.680]   doesn't mean it doesn't mean a lot of things. What do you all suppose Renee Richie let's start
[01:14:42.680 --> 01:14:48.360]   with you. What do you think Facebook's up to here are they just trying to compete with YouTube or
[01:14:48.360 --> 01:14:55.240]   they intending to compete with Apple music or with iTunes. What is their game here what are they
[01:14:55.240 --> 01:15:00.200]   probably going toward? It's amazing because historically a lot of people have likened first
[01:15:00.200 --> 01:15:04.600]   Microsoft and then Google to semi-drunk and giants and they meant by that that you never knew
[01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:08.760]   where they're going to put their foot down next and it might be firmly on top of your business
[01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:13.400]   because they were large they were well financed and they were hyper competitive and Facebook
[01:15:13.400 --> 01:15:17.480]   really is like that because you seemingly can't tell from one minute to the next what they're
[01:15:17.480 --> 01:15:21.000]   going to do like Mark Zuckerberg really wants to make a phone and then he wants to make an
[01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:24.040]   operating system layer and then he doesn't want to do it anymore and then he wants to make maps
[01:15:24.040 --> 01:15:28.280]   and then there's no maps that come and now he maybe wants to make music and because you have such a
[01:15:28.280 --> 01:15:34.760]   such a character almost like like Mark Zuckerberg they really can spin on a whim and then choose
[01:15:34.760 --> 01:15:39.640]   where they want to go and video has been really interesting because they had massive stats for
[01:15:39.640 --> 01:15:45.080]   video but those videos were self-playing videos that as long as you scroll down your timeline you
[01:15:45.080 --> 01:15:49.720]   would see that video and is that stat real if someone watched it for two seconds as it flew by I
[01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:53.960]   don't know I don't know how it was reported and then recently we heard about all the free booting
[01:15:53.960 --> 01:15:58.200]   where people would just rip videos from YouTube including famous people put them up on Facebook
[01:15:58.200 --> 01:16:03.800]   and they'd become viral completely away from the content creators so it is it is not at all hard
[01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:09.000]   to believe that they might want to get into some sort of more formal arrangement for these videos
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:15.720]   especially if they're forced to be as protective about content and content rights holders as YouTube
[01:16:15.720 --> 01:16:20.200]   has become but again I don't know if a month from now they'll decide that something else is
[01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:24.040]   the most important thing in the world and I think that's part of what makes them both scary and
[01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:30.440]   fascinating fascinating to all of us and scary for anyone who tries to compete with them now there's
[01:16:30.440 --> 01:16:34.280]   an interesting element element to this of course they boosted video I mentioned that they're obsessed
[01:16:34.280 --> 01:16:39.320]   with video they've done that mainly by just tweaking their algorithm and making videos more
[01:16:39.320 --> 01:16:44.680]   likely to show up in people's news feeds of course the majority of the stuff that people post your
[01:16:44.680 --> 01:16:48.440]   family and friends post if you leave all the defaults on you're not ever going to see those in your
[01:16:48.440 --> 01:16:53.160]   news feed they're available to you and yes you can change the news feed but that's one of the ways
[01:16:53.160 --> 01:16:57.480]   they boosted videos just by making videos show up in your news feed more well native Facebook
[01:16:57.480 --> 01:17:02.280]   videos and then they I think they down prioritize links to YouTube on competing services yeah yes
[01:17:02.280 --> 01:17:07.480]   and they can just do that stuff of course algorithms are secrets they don't have to explain what they've
[01:17:07.480 --> 01:17:13.880]   done they can just do these things but Facebook actually did something great and welcome and also
[01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:21.400]   surprising which is that they added user controls for the news feed that enable anybody to get a lot
[01:17:21.400 --> 01:17:27.320]   more control over the news feed why do you suppose they're doing this Andy and not go are they are
[01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:32.520]   they just you know it seems uncharacteristic of Facebook to do something like this that seems to
[01:17:32.520 --> 01:17:40.280]   kind of harm their control of you know what people see in their news feeds but it does in fact benefit
[01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:46.760]   users why why do they do this because the news feed is their one product and you can't put poison
[01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:53.480]   down your one well and I think that it all it sort of anticipates moves they've made it echoes
[01:17:53.480 --> 01:17:57.400]   moves they've made in the past year and maybe anticipates moves they're about to make that they're
[01:17:57.400 --> 01:18:03.000]   about to use that news feed for all kinds of new kinds of content and new kinds of partner
[01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:08.440]   agreements and new kinds of discoverability I believe Zuckerberg and the and Facebook when they
[01:18:08.440 --> 01:18:11.960]   say that they have no immediate plans to create a streaming music service but that doesn't mean
[01:18:11.960 --> 01:18:17.640]   they're not talking to labels about ways for them to insert I wouldn't say ads but discoverability
[01:18:17.640 --> 01:18:22.440]   for heavily marketed new tracks and albums into other people's news feeds and so they realize that
[01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:29.160]   once their that news feed becomes just this this unrelenting conveyor belt of crap interspersed
[01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:35.080]   with pictures of of of your mom's new cat that's when people start leaving Facebook and start going
[01:18:35.080 --> 01:18:40.200]   to other services so I think that they're they're gonna need to give users more control over what
[01:18:40.200 --> 01:18:44.360]   appears in that news feed to make sure that that news feed continues to be a really good
[01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:49.720]   central landing point for all of their users to start the to start using the internet and that
[01:18:49.720 --> 01:18:54.280]   really is what Facebook is all about to the to the people who use it it is it is that centralized
[01:18:54.280 --> 01:18:59.800]   dashboard that will give them a collected sort of feed of all the things that they're interested in
[01:18:59.800 --> 01:19:04.760]   not just new stuff but again their personal relationships private conversations and stuff like that so
[01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:08.600]   it makes sense for them to want to preserve the integrity of that for their users it is
[01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:14.040]   one of those one of those apple moves where let's make let's make a move that is very much for our
[01:19:14.040 --> 01:19:20.920]   users but also benefits us in the long run yeah for sure well I don't know about you guys but I
[01:19:20.920 --> 01:19:27.560]   hate it when a big company buys another big company that makes products that are beloved by
[01:19:27.560 --> 01:19:33.160]   some people and then they shut it down or they wind it down or they hide it or they do something
[01:19:33.160 --> 01:19:38.120]   like that yeah who does this a lot lots of companies do this it looks like Microsoft is kind of sort
[01:19:38.120 --> 01:19:44.040]   of doing that with the phone business that they bought from Nokia what is going on at Microsoft
[01:19:44.040 --> 01:19:51.640]   why why are they sort of de-emphasizing their phone hardware business but hang on Mike you're
[01:19:51.640 --> 01:19:57.320]   not saying you love Nokia are you no I'm not but I but a lot of people do and a lot of
[01:19:57.320 --> 01:20:01.800]   Finnish people do and and you know it's this is a company with great technology they just happen
[01:20:01.800 --> 01:20:05.960]   to not be apple or google and anybody in the smartphone business who is an apple or google is
[01:20:05.960 --> 01:20:12.520]   not going to have an easy time competing with apple and google but but Jeff this is this is
[01:20:12.520 --> 01:20:19.000]   people have a lot of high hopes and and everybody said you know hey if they could just come out with
[01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:25.560]   some innovative high-end flagship smartphone hardware they could start to creep up and actually
[01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:31.160]   become a a player but it looks like they're they're kind of backing off yeah I mean they gave a good
[01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:35.160]   run at it and I'd like to hear from the other guys what they think did they even have a chance
[01:20:35.160 --> 01:20:39.640]   because some school of thoughts were like all more had to do this is mobile you could build it or
[01:20:39.640 --> 01:20:44.360]   you can acquire it acquire it was faster and they gave it a good shot but it just didn't work
[01:20:44.360 --> 01:20:49.640]   why was that could Microsoft have done a difference or any way Microsoft could have made a phone
[01:20:49.640 --> 01:20:53.800]   entry was a bad execution or is it something they just never could have done in the first place
[01:20:53.800 --> 01:21:02.360]   I was just I just wonder if this isn't a cookie that they waved towards other
[01:21:03.080 --> 01:21:08.840]   handset manufacturers because the more you look at what what Microsoft has planned for 2015 and
[01:21:08.840 --> 01:21:13.960]   beyond it really they really are going all in on this there is no difference between all of our
[01:21:13.960 --> 01:21:18.360]   platforms there is one thing called Windows and it runs on whatever screen you happen to have
[01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:22.520]   in front of you whether it is a phone whether it is a desktop or anything in between to the
[01:21:22.520 --> 01:21:27.800]   extent where they're encouraging developers to write this one app that will rearticulate itself
[01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:32.520]   depending on what piece of hardware it finds itself on at one given time and that could be a
[01:21:32.520 --> 01:21:39.640]   really incredible twist to to computing of apple famously has you know made the
[01:21:39.640 --> 01:21:44.920]   comic made the comments about you know we're not making toaster fridges and we're making pickup
[01:21:44.920 --> 01:21:48.520]   trucks and we're making cars and we're making different things for that their tailor for different
[01:21:48.520 --> 01:21:55.640]   experiences but if you're looking at a user base that isn't necessarily a huge fan of any one
[01:21:55.640 --> 01:22:00.200]   operating system they just want a phone that does good things and you say well here try this it
[01:22:00.200 --> 01:22:04.760]   costs a hundred and forty nine dollars and basically all the software that you're running on your
[01:22:04.760 --> 01:22:09.560]   laptop right now also runs on this and you never have to worry about where your data is or whether
[01:22:09.560 --> 01:22:13.720]   you can use it on this device that could be really really compelling and there might have been a
[01:22:13.720 --> 01:22:18.520]   time where they had to own a handset manufacturer to get anybody to make a windows windows phone
[01:22:18.520 --> 01:22:24.120]   hardware maybe it's more valuable for them to say look we are not going to if you HTC Samsung all
[01:22:24.120 --> 01:22:28.440]   of you guys LG if you want to try to make a we are not going to be competing with you in the
[01:22:28.440 --> 01:22:33.240]   handset market please just make stuff that will support windows and that could be a win win for
[01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:37.640]   both companies. I don't think this is like just personally I don't think this is any surprise I
[01:22:37.640 --> 01:22:42.040]   think Microsoft was one of those companies where their success hit massive problems within their
[01:22:42.040 --> 01:22:46.440]   organization and we've sort of seen that now they were almost you know criminally is the wrong
[01:22:46.440 --> 01:22:52.280]   word but they were blatantly terribly bad about entering mobile I was a big windows mobile user
[01:22:52.280 --> 01:22:57.160]   I think the trio pro was the last windows mobile user I had and I had one point I had windows
[01:22:57.160 --> 01:23:02.600]   PCs I had an Xbox I had the the trio pro and none of these could talk to so there was no
[01:23:02.600 --> 01:23:06.840]   integration Bill Gates made those famous speeches at CES about how wonderful it would be to put your
[01:23:06.840 --> 01:23:11.080]   phone down it would take over your computer it was fantasy they were never able as a company to
[01:23:11.080 --> 01:23:15.720]   execute on any of those things it took Apple and Google you know a while to do it themselves but
[01:23:15.720 --> 01:23:20.600]   they did it before Microsoft I could get fully functional office on my iPad before I could get
[01:23:20.600 --> 01:23:25.320]   it on any of Microsoft's mobile products and you can blame Steve bomber for this I certainly would
[01:23:25.320 --> 01:23:31.560]   I don't think buying Nokia did them any benefit they devalued that company extensively before they
[01:23:31.560 --> 01:23:36.280]   bought it and it just looks like they were completely inept at embracing mobile and I don't think
[01:23:36.280 --> 01:23:40.840]   you can recover from that I'm not sure as a company I'm sure they have tons of money it's not like
[01:23:40.840 --> 01:23:45.560]   HTC or like Palm was where or like Blackberry was where they have no ancillary products to help
[01:23:45.560 --> 01:23:50.760]   see them through difficult times in mobile but it's hard to see any good resolution for this when
[01:23:50.760 --> 01:23:55.880]   they did finally get their act together it was years too late and it was with products that were just
[01:23:55.880 --> 01:24:01.400]   not compelling enough to take on companies that entered mobile way after they did and if I sound
[01:24:01.400 --> 01:24:06.840]   hugely disappointed I am because I went to Apple because Microsoft just didn't do anything and I
[01:24:06.840 --> 01:24:12.040]   would not be at Apple today if they'd had their act together earlier yeah bad but also it's bad
[01:24:12.040 --> 01:24:18.840]   yeah it's also smart that I hope that their their plan was never to be be a big success on the level
[01:24:18.840 --> 01:24:24.280]   of Apple and selling phones because that's never going to happen you're not you can't judge your
[01:24:24.280 --> 01:24:28.760]   you can't build your career of saying that I'm going to be the Beatles because there is already
[01:24:28.760 --> 01:24:33.080]   the Beatles and there was a specific set of circumstances that allowed the Beatles to become the Beatles
[01:24:33.080 --> 01:24:37.960]   what you have to do is figure out what your skills are what your own real actions are and play to
[01:24:37.960 --> 01:24:43.720]   those strengths Microsoft just like Renee said I mean they're they finally found their car keys
[01:24:43.720 --> 01:24:48.680]   about four years ago I mean they just been fumbling just but they spent 10 years just like patting down
[01:24:48.680 --> 01:24:52.920]   pockets and then checking the jacket and the closet they already checked 14 different times
[01:24:52.920 --> 01:24:57.560]   before coming out with any sort of a strategy for creating operating systems and software and
[01:24:57.560 --> 01:25:02.840]   services that were really really relevant in a post-iPhone world they finally figured it out
[01:25:02.840 --> 01:25:07.560]   they figured out that they need to get rebalmer for one thing but after that I think that they're
[01:25:07.560 --> 01:25:12.040]   on a right track now the things that I've seen about Windows 10 I've been using Windows 10 for a while
[01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:18.200]   I think that they've got a lot going on that Apple is missing out on believe it or not
[01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:22.680]   but it's all about if they can actually execute this great great plan it would be the first time
[01:25:22.680 --> 01:25:26.600]   they've actually done it but again I think they found the car keys three or four years ago so now
[01:25:26.600 --> 01:25:30.440]   for the first time I don't feel like I'm an idiot for thinking that Apple might excuse me that
[01:25:30.440 --> 01:25:35.320]   Microsoft might be finally able to do something smart with phones and I hope that if they are
[01:25:35.320 --> 01:25:41.400]   getting rid of Nokia the same way that Google got rid of Motorola or at least the phone arm of
[01:25:41.400 --> 01:25:46.600]   Motorola I hope that it's for the reason of trying to enhance more people to buy to manufacture
[01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:50.280]   hardware that supports this new vision that they have yeah I said why I mean I think the real
[01:25:50.280 --> 01:25:57.640]   problem is that if you go down the laundry list of super hot mainstream platforms there is no
[01:25:57.640 --> 01:26:05.800]   lot there I mean you know IDC just announced this week that the PC business has declined 11.8 percent
[01:26:05.800 --> 01:26:10.840]   this is a continuation of a decline that's been going on for a long time but that's a huge drop
[01:26:12.360 --> 01:26:20.280]   Gardner reported 9.5 but they're actually counting high-end tablets as PCs you look at the tablet
[01:26:20.280 --> 01:26:26.200]   market everybody's even even the iPad is not doing what people think it should be doing in general
[01:26:26.200 --> 01:26:30.120]   people buy one and that's it they don't have to upgrade they don't feel any pressure to upgrade
[01:26:30.120 --> 01:26:34.680]   every two years or whatever even Apple in the smartwatch business we're hearing reports that
[01:26:34.680 --> 01:26:40.840]   they the Apple Watch is not selling as they had hoped and the only category that's just
[01:26:41.560 --> 01:26:48.040]   exploding and it continues without a sign of abatement is the smartphone business now again this
[01:26:48.040 --> 01:26:52.120]   isn't necessarily the you know that Microsoft doesn't necessarily have to be in the handset
[01:26:52.120 --> 01:26:58.840]   hardware business but they really need to be major they really should be in the hot business well
[01:26:58.840 --> 01:27:06.680]   what where else can well where else where can Microsoft succeed is it is it in you know the
[01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:12.040]   future of Xbox is that the future of HoloLens is that the future of the hub the Surface Hub
[01:27:12.040 --> 01:27:17.720]   device which by the way is fantastic it's a fantastic product they're just not going to sell
[01:27:17.720 --> 01:27:23.320]   a lot of them because you know that's it's not a mainstream consumer product where is this going
[01:27:23.320 --> 01:27:31.320]   Jeff let's go to you what do you think Microsoft's best bet is to become what they were historically
[01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:38.120]   which is a behemoth that's you know sort of you know an industry leader driving a platform or two
[01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:44.200]   well let's start with one thing that's really struck me is that Microsoft is interesting again
[01:27:44.200 --> 01:27:48.760]   we didn't talk about Microsoft the last couple years it was just sort of a joke over on the side
[01:27:48.760 --> 01:27:54.280]   is it milked windows then we thought it slowly go away but it seems lately they're making some
[01:27:54.280 --> 01:27:59.240]   bets will it work or not I don't know but as Amy said they found their keys and now let's
[01:27:59.240 --> 01:28:03.640]   let's see what they do as for way out I don't know Xbox always seems like the one kind of
[01:28:03.640 --> 01:28:09.560]   not a crown jewel but it's it's the one product I like and everyone likes I hate windows my new
[01:28:09.560 --> 01:28:14.120]   job I have to use Outlook and it's deplorable so but what they're going to do next I don't know
[01:28:14.120 --> 01:28:18.840]   my colleague Barb Darrow says rebedding on cloud but is there room for them to get in there I don't
[01:28:18.840 --> 01:28:24.920]   know but let's just start with the fact that Microsoft seems interesting and I'm not sure relevant but
[01:28:24.920 --> 01:28:31.720]   they're certainly there don't know I have a hard time seeing it and I just to go back for a second
[01:28:31.720 --> 01:28:36.200]   the Apple Watch is interesting to me because those numbers that were reported were were not
[01:28:36.200 --> 01:28:40.120]   well reported and it's Apple never announced figures for what they wanted but my understanding
[01:28:40.120 --> 01:28:44.040]   is when you look at the wearables market and you look at what the Apple Watch has sold it's done
[01:28:44.040 --> 01:28:48.760]   really well for that kind of technology and it it'd be interesting to see it compared to other
[01:28:48.760 --> 01:28:53.800]   entry level products and other products that spike during a sale season and go down but I think a lot
[01:28:53.800 --> 01:28:57.560]   same with the iPad though the iPad is not selling as well as it used to be a lot of companies would
[01:28:57.560 --> 01:29:01.320]   give their IT's for a business is profitable that and my guess is Apple Watch is extremely
[01:29:01.320 --> 01:29:05.080]   profitable right now too and that's the problem with things like Microsoft and even things when
[01:29:05.080 --> 01:29:10.120]   you look at Android huge huge platform but you go back to those profitability figures and Apple's
[01:29:10.120 --> 01:29:15.560]   eating 92% of that profit and what can a company like Microsoft do to be profitable because as a
[01:29:15.560 --> 01:29:20.200]   people we're increasingly saying that software and services have no value to us we'd want them if
[01:29:20.200 --> 01:29:25.640]   they're free and we'll do very little else beyond that so what position companies like HTC and
[01:29:25.640 --> 01:29:31.720]   companies like Motorola and companies like Nokia slash Microsoft can do to survive and to be viable
[01:29:31.720 --> 01:29:36.440]   products in their own right it's really difficult to see and even if you think they're taking bold
[01:29:36.440 --> 01:29:40.600]   bets with things like HoloLens or they're going all to the cloud maybe that's an IBM business
[01:29:40.600 --> 01:29:44.280]   eventually where they're a huge company that nobody really thinks too much about because their
[01:29:44.280 --> 01:29:49.480]   infrastructure and backbone and Asia is feeding iCloud or something else like that really really
[01:29:49.480 --> 01:29:55.080]   hard to see. I will weep if that happens because I want a highly competitive environment I'm weeping
[01:29:55.080 --> 01:29:59.480]   right now for Blackberry you know maybe they were interestingly announced the passport but as time
[01:29:59.480 --> 01:30:04.280]   goes on you start to see what happens to these companies the bold bets they make they don't pay
[01:30:04.280 --> 01:30:09.480]   off anymore and they start to make sort of like Andy said they find their car keys but maybe at a
[01:30:09.480 --> 01:30:15.080]   time when we no longer use cars that much so my greater concern from Microsoft is whether they are
[01:30:15.080 --> 01:30:19.880]   as a culture able to make great products again whether that product is cloud computing or that
[01:30:19.880 --> 01:30:23.480]   product is a phone because corporate culture really matters we're seeing that is one of the
[01:30:23.480 --> 01:30:29.400]   driving forces behind success these days and such an Adele is doing an amazing transformation but
[01:30:29.400 --> 01:30:35.000]   it is enough fast enough I don't know Renee do you have any predictions or advice for Blackberry?
[01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:39.880]   So I mean I'm nobody I can't give them any advice or predictions at all I'm more
[01:30:39.880 --> 01:30:44.760]   as a Canadian who lost Northtown lost Corel and lost 3D effects on a lot of other great Canadian
[01:30:44.760 --> 01:30:50.920]   companies. But what would Corel such a big loss really? I mean as very few countries have sort
[01:30:50.920 --> 01:30:55.480]   of the technology industry very few countries made major mobile operating systems you know the
[01:30:55.480 --> 01:30:59.960]   US has Android and iOS but there's just not that many countries that do it and it's sort of a point
[01:30:59.960 --> 01:31:06.040]   of pride that that Canada had first the J2ME that ran Blackberry and then Q and X and unfortunately
[01:31:06.040 --> 01:31:11.400]   it looks like Blackberry might take Q and X down with them yet to be determined I don't know they're
[01:31:11.400 --> 01:31:16.840]   going all in on enterprise but and they're making a couple new devices like the classic and and I
[01:31:16.840 --> 01:31:20.120]   forget what the other one is coming after that and maybe they're making an Android phone now
[01:31:20.120 --> 01:31:24.600]   but like Microsoft I don't know if it's too little too late and unlike Samsung and unlike
[01:31:24.600 --> 01:31:29.160]   Microsoft they don't have massive ancillary businesses to draw profits on to keep them going
[01:31:29.160 --> 01:31:36.760]   in the interim so I'm not I'm sadly not optimistic. Well I gotta I gotta say that
[01:31:39.800 --> 01:31:46.520]   for profitability no one can touch Apple they are fantastic at generating money there's just
[01:31:46.520 --> 01:31:52.760]   no one who can even touch them but it has to be saved said that they're able to do that because
[01:31:52.760 --> 01:32:00.680]   there's a company like Microsoft that is serving the needs of about 80 I'm sorry but closer to 90%
[01:32:00.680 --> 01:32:06.040]   of all desktop users in the world there are things that Apple is unwilling or let's also
[01:32:06.040 --> 01:32:11.400]   confront the idea that they are also maybe unable to do which is to sell computers for the entire
[01:32:11.400 --> 01:32:19.000]   world not just the people with money. The entire market share of Mac OS and Windows Mac OS and Linux
[01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:27.240]   combined is one half the market share of Windows XP that's how tiny the user base of Mac OS is.
[01:32:27.240 --> 01:32:33.400]   Same thing for for the iPhone where they are Apple is either unable or unwilling or maybe even
[01:32:33.400 --> 01:32:38.600]   again unable to create phones that the entire world can use they are making they are able to
[01:32:38.600 --> 01:32:42.440]   have the business they have because there are other people who have the responsibility for putting a
[01:32:42.440 --> 01:32:46.920]   computer for putting a phone in the hands of everybody who needs or wants a phone they just
[01:32:46.920 --> 01:32:53.320]   want the people who have money so this is good for Apple because this not not not just for you know
[01:32:53.320 --> 01:32:57.880]   money money money we all like money but that gives us them the ability to experiment more take bigger
[01:32:57.880 --> 01:33:04.840]   risks have bigger failures that they can absorb by a cushion but let's not pretend that Microsoft
[01:33:04.840 --> 01:33:09.560]   is not providing a valuable service for the entire world with their products again they are they
[01:33:09.560 --> 01:33:14.040]   they are the gears and the grease that runs business and that that runs worldwide computing again
[01:33:14.040 --> 01:33:18.920]   Apple they they don't want that business or they don't care about that business so I just I just
[01:33:18.920 --> 01:33:22.680]   don't like it when the I don't think that Renee was taking the discussion in that direction but
[01:33:22.680 --> 01:33:28.040]   whenever we talk about this in general we have to say that again if Apple if we if we were to have
[01:33:28.040 --> 01:33:33.480]   a magic wand and make Microsoft disappear and now Apple is forced to compete where people come into
[01:33:33.480 --> 01:33:39.160]   the store say that well I've got $500 to spend on a to spend on a desktop what can you sell me
[01:33:39.160 --> 01:33:44.200]   and what you can sell me is here's how much time we put calculating the proper chamfer angle
[01:33:44.200 --> 01:33:49.240]   of our $1,300 computer it's like they're gonna find that they're gonna have to start making less
[01:33:49.240 --> 01:33:53.480]   expensive computers they're gonna have to start making computers that that user in Pakistan and
[01:33:53.480 --> 01:33:58.680]   that user in India is gonna is gonna make sense for them and again they have not demonstrated that
[01:33:58.680 --> 01:34:02.920]   they have the ability and the knowledge to actually build a computer like that they show me an
[01:34:02.920 --> 01:34:08.120]   iPhone 6 and I'm dazzled but I'm also dazzled by a Raspberry Pi and I think they're both on the
[01:34:08.120 --> 01:34:11.960]   exact same footing in terms of what's really really an impressive achievement in computer
[01:34:11.960 --> 01:34:16.600]   engineering so I think you're absolutely right and I agree with you 100 my only thing with with
[01:34:16.600 --> 01:34:21.240]   where I was going with that is there are some companies and I loved webOS I loved palm I love
[01:34:21.240 --> 01:34:26.440]   Nokia people were streaming live from the N95 long before they were using Mirkat or Periscope or
[01:34:26.440 --> 01:34:31.080]   anything but I think a lot of companies thought that after Apple and after Google they would be
[01:34:31.080 --> 01:34:35.560]   the defacto they could basically there was a right to be the third place participant in this
[01:34:35.560 --> 01:34:39.880]   category and it turned out that Android was both first place and third place whether that's
[01:34:39.880 --> 01:34:43.720]   different carrier different manufacturer Android open source project Chinese Android whatever you
[01:34:43.720 --> 01:34:48.360]   want to label it there was no divine right to third place and Microsoft like Blackberry
[01:34:48.360 --> 01:34:53.160]   Blackberry race of the year on the playbook that didn't make phones Microsoft made the surface and
[01:34:53.160 --> 01:34:57.400]   tried to advertise it against the iPad and then against awkwardly against the MacBook Air without
[01:34:57.400 --> 01:35:02.440]   changing the copy that said hey we have USB ports and that sort of stuff is just not not good for
[01:35:02.440 --> 01:35:07.160]   us as an industry and I wish Microsoft was better at it because I don't want the choice to be between
[01:35:07.160 --> 01:35:12.440]   two different Googles or you know different versions of Android I'd rather we have better more robust
[01:35:12.440 --> 01:35:18.120]   competition and just a correction Andy you said that if somebody walked into the Apple store and
[01:35:18.120 --> 01:35:22.680]   said they wanted to buy a five hundred dollar computer and that implied that Apple doesn't have
[01:35:22.680 --> 01:35:28.920]   a solution of course they do their cheapest wristwatch would be what they would sell Mac Mac mini
[01:35:28.920 --> 01:35:34.120]   iPad right exactly this this is a fine you're gonna you're gonna have a hard time writing your
[01:35:34.120 --> 01:35:39.880]   term paper on Apple watch and the fact that it's going to spend every keystroke 10 seconds
[01:35:39.880 --> 01:35:43.800]   communicating back to the phone and then getting the keystroke back again that also is going to
[01:35:43.800 --> 01:35:47.400]   you're gonna have to get a late take the letter grade down for for being late for that
[01:35:47.400 --> 01:35:52.360]   well we got some more stories coming up in just a second but first let's talk about mobile

[01:38:03.640 --> 01:38:10.120]   ads uh let's find out what happened here on twit in the past week previously on twit
[01:38:10.120 --> 01:38:18.840]   they do a lot of really stumble into this tech news today trading was temporarily stopped on the
[01:38:18.840 --> 01:38:25.560]   new york stock exchange for today because of some technical issues also united airlines grounded all
[01:38:25.560 --> 01:38:30.680]   flights today for about two hours after experiencing what the company said was a network connectivity
[01:38:30.680 --> 01:38:35.640]   issue from what we're hearing from the ny sc they're not related at all they're not cyber attacks i
[01:38:35.640 --> 01:38:39.960]   did tell the ny sc to reboot that raspberry pie that they run everything on but they didn't listen to me
[01:38:39.960 --> 01:38:47.640]   ios today so you have this excellent idea for us to get our craft on make some diy
[01:38:47.640 --> 01:38:50.040]   iphone and ipad cases so i think i did it
[01:38:50.040 --> 01:38:59.000]   this week in google google has this uh software that will make images and the end result is pure
[01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:06.280]   unfiltered lsd this is closer to how the human mind actually works i'm like hey Jason can you
[01:39:06.280 --> 01:39:12.520]   call the guys in the white coats from like if this is how his brain works twit some assembly required
[01:39:14.760 --> 01:39:20.520]   all right great material there i don't know what what pardrey and and those guys were doing at the
[01:39:20.520 --> 01:39:26.280]   beginning wow great stuff well gentlemen uh jawbone is suing fitbit this is the third lawsuit
[01:39:26.280 --> 01:39:31.640]   in a while this one in particular is being filed with the international trade commission and what
[01:39:31.640 --> 01:39:37.800]   they're trying to do is block fitbit from importing fitness trackers or even the parts to those fitness
[01:39:37.800 --> 01:39:43.960]   trackers because what they're claiming is that employees uh were poached of jawbone employees were
[01:39:43.960 --> 01:39:50.120]   poached by fitbit those employees stole uh proprietary company secrets they brought them
[01:39:50.120 --> 01:39:56.520]   over to fitbit and then fitbit productize them um jeff is this from what you understand does this
[01:39:56.520 --> 01:40:01.880]   case have merit does that whole argument uh have any merit do we have enough information to even
[01:40:01.880 --> 01:40:08.680]   know that uh what this screams to me is that uh jawbone is losing to fitbit you only start
[01:40:08.680 --> 01:40:14.120]   pulling these sort of tactics out when you're losing um the factors the itc and the patent
[01:40:14.120 --> 01:40:18.600]   lawsuit i mean those two always go together um if you're suing in one you can soon the other
[01:40:18.600 --> 01:40:23.080]   automatically so i would just read this whole story simply being jawbones the loser in the
[01:40:23.080 --> 01:40:28.440]   business stuff instead of pulling out the dirty IP tricks that's that's my take on it i mean
[01:40:29.720 --> 01:40:34.600]   all right you might think that else what uh any thoughts uh Andy
[01:40:34.600 --> 01:40:40.680]   no i mean exactly what jeff said i mean you don't i've been read i've re-inbought this lawsuit and
[01:40:40.680 --> 01:40:46.680]   it doesn't seem as though they've they're fitbit is doing anything that other companies have not
[01:40:46.680 --> 01:40:51.160]   done without any attraction of lawsuits i think the big problem is that they are making money and
[01:40:51.160 --> 01:40:58.120]   making products that people find relevant rest job but jawbone is is jawbone is you is the the
[01:40:58.120 --> 01:41:02.680]   christmas present that a kid opens excited until he sees the logo is not the fitbit logo that's what
[01:41:02.680 --> 01:41:08.200]   jawbone is right now the only thing i can add to this is that again uh we look at companies often
[01:41:08.200 --> 01:41:12.200]   and we forget that they're made up of human beings and human beings do not take losing very well
[01:41:12.200 --> 01:41:16.920]   and it's very easy and sometimes it's there's even merit to it to believe that a company has
[01:41:16.920 --> 01:41:23.400]   unfairly won a market or is is winning um you know for an unrighteous reason and then the human
[01:41:23.400 --> 01:41:27.400]   response to that is we'll go get them and that often manifests in business as a lawsuit so there
[01:41:27.400 --> 01:41:31.480]   could be people very well inside jawbone who truly believe the depth of their being that they have
[01:41:31.480 --> 01:41:35.480]   been badly done by and this is a recourse they're they're doing and whether or not that has any
[01:41:35.480 --> 01:41:42.040]   basis on realities you know to anyone to choose well shifting gears a little bit it appears
[01:41:42.040 --> 01:41:47.240]   increasingly like the internet of things is becoming mainstream uh on my way in today i was
[01:41:47.240 --> 01:41:51.400]   listening to panda or i don't have the ad-free version i have the advertising version there was an
[01:41:51.400 --> 01:41:59.320]   ad uh for ibm's internet of things platform it was kind of egg but uh but still on pandaora uh so i
[01:41:59.320 --> 01:42:05.800]   thought and you know on the green day channel too uh so it's really it's becoming more uh mainstream
[01:42:05.800 --> 01:42:12.120]   and another example of that i think probably even the best example is that target has opened a let's
[01:42:12.120 --> 01:42:18.440]   face it it's an apple store essentially uh where they have all kinds of internet of things devices
[01:42:18.440 --> 01:42:24.760]   displayed not in techie geeky sort of like radio shack kind of way but again in a very consumer
[01:42:24.760 --> 01:42:30.280]   friendly warm and fuzzy apple store kind of way where it's like look at all this fun stuff uh for
[01:42:30.280 --> 01:42:38.680]   the internet of internet of things is this is this a good strategy for target what what do you suppose
[01:42:38.680 --> 01:42:43.320]   they hope to gain from this i'll throw that open to anybody who wants to jump on it it's a tough
[01:42:43.320 --> 01:42:48.120]   thing to sell to people isn't it i mean you have to it's that there's so many devices that are on sale
[01:42:48.120 --> 01:42:53.640]   in the past year and a half that simply did not exist two years ago and we're talking about smart
[01:42:53.640 --> 01:42:58.120]   watches we're talking about smart light bulbs we're talking about thermostats things like that
[01:42:58.120 --> 01:43:03.640]   that people did not grow up around and they don't have a constant an existing use force so what they
[01:43:03.640 --> 01:43:08.120]   have to do is the stores have to do a lot more aggressive or a lot more handholding to say
[01:43:08.120 --> 01:43:12.520]   here is why you would want to spend double the amount of money for an led bulb uh then for the
[01:43:12.520 --> 01:43:16.840]   ones you can get at home depot here's why you want to create that you want to spend this astronomical
[01:43:16.840 --> 01:43:20.840]   amount of money for a nest thermostat and here's why this wristwatch that
[01:43:20.840 --> 01:43:24.360]   don't won't even tell you the time until you actually do something to shake it and wake it up
[01:43:24.360 --> 01:43:28.200]   is much better than the watch that you have on right now that your grandfather gave you
[01:43:28.200 --> 01:43:32.600]   and so you do need these active demo areas and that's particularly going to be true of target
[01:43:32.600 --> 01:43:38.040]   people come into an apple store with a probably with a fundamental knowledge of technology or
[01:43:38.040 --> 01:43:43.400]   with a desire to know people come into target because they ran out of salad dressing so to have
[01:43:43.400 --> 01:43:49.400]   this sort of a better outreach to be a warm friendly environment clean with everything running and
[01:43:49.400 --> 01:43:54.920]   no fingerprints on them that's just smart for a target and i'll add to it Andy i agree with Andy
[01:43:54.920 --> 01:43:59.160]   completely and you know i'm saying that a lot because it's true but i think you can at 50 years
[01:43:59.160 --> 01:44:03.080]   from now 20 years from now all our stuff will just be smart but we're in the period of transition
[01:44:03.080 --> 01:44:08.120]   the turbulence and to get from there to hear sorry from here to there uh people are going to have
[01:44:08.120 --> 01:44:12.600]   to go through a process now things like target is an approach to trying to ease us into that process
[01:44:12.600 --> 01:44:17.480]   because things are going to be more difficult and more confusing and more expensive over the short
[01:44:17.480 --> 01:44:22.040]   term but in a few years from now you're just going to get things with chipsets and radios in it
[01:44:22.040 --> 01:44:25.400]   it's just going to be the way that things are sort of like how now we have things that have
[01:44:25.400 --> 01:44:30.280]   electricity uh in the may not have used to have them and target is probably doing a smart thing
[01:44:30.280 --> 01:44:34.680]   because the worst thing that could happen is that some other company gets the early adopter wave
[01:44:34.680 --> 01:44:38.120]   where there's a lot more money and a lot more interest to be made so i think things like this
[01:44:38.120 --> 01:44:42.200]   are great whether target is the best approach who knows amazon's going to do something and
[01:44:42.840 --> 01:44:47.240]   again five years from now we'll all be using our our hue light bulbs or whatever whatever light bulbs
[01:44:47.240 --> 01:44:51.960]   we have you know everybody talks about the internet of things and you're absolutely right
[01:44:51.960 --> 01:44:56.120]   everything's going to have a chip everything's going to have a radio everything will be potentially
[01:44:56.120 --> 01:45:01.480]   able to connect but i feel like this is just a train coming down the track a train wreck coming
[01:45:01.480 --> 01:45:08.280]   down the track really because i don't see this segment of the industry doing anything to solve
[01:45:08.280 --> 01:45:14.760]   the problem multiple incompatible platforms on multiple levels uh and and i don't see any
[01:45:14.760 --> 01:45:20.440]   dominant players i don't see uh any sort of agreement i don't see enough of those sort of uh kabals
[01:45:20.440 --> 01:45:27.880]   that they form around standards and so on brook like brook yep right exactly so i mean rene this
[01:45:27.880 --> 01:45:33.640]   if you were to go back in time uh so you know 15 years or 20 years or whatever they would say
[01:45:33.640 --> 01:45:37.960]   oh in the future you have all these devices attached to tv and only one remote control everybody
[01:45:37.960 --> 01:45:42.200]   will have one remote to control everything and of course everybody's got a whole pile of
[01:45:42.200 --> 01:45:48.360]   remotes because the tv industry has not figured out the relatively simple solution to the problem
[01:45:48.360 --> 01:45:53.240]   of multiple incompatible uh tv remotes and people are confused they you know you go into your average
[01:45:53.240 --> 01:45:57.960]   house that where they have a tv you know and and a couple of devices plugged in and they pick up
[01:45:57.960 --> 01:46:01.640]   the remote to do this they figured out they've learned through trial and error that if you pick
[01:46:01.640 --> 01:46:05.000]   up this remote push this button then you pick up the other remote to do the volume and then you have
[01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:10.520]   to go i mean this is where tv remotes are at and this is not an original thought this is called
[01:46:10.520 --> 01:46:15.560]   the basket of remotes problem but how how is this industry going to get the internet of things to
[01:46:15.560 --> 01:46:20.520]   be an actual internet of things it's a just to to illustrate that point my mom has a samsung tv
[01:46:20.520 --> 01:46:25.160]   and a samsung cable box and one does not fit under the other and when the cable box next to the tv
[01:46:25.160 --> 01:46:29.320]   the audio is out of sync but when it's connected to the apple tv it works fine and she's just a
[01:46:29.320 --> 01:46:33.560]   normal person and has no idea how to cope with any of these things much less the three controls
[01:46:33.560 --> 01:46:38.040]   that came with two devices because one has a flat surface and one has buttons so i i think that
[01:46:38.040 --> 01:46:44.200]   problem is absolutely right and i apologize click on it who do you cut off was that you know jeff sorry
[01:46:44.200 --> 01:46:49.160]   yeah no i know i like i think that's really astute what you're saying that target can build it but
[01:46:49.160 --> 01:46:53.960]   will they come i think really grabby consumer stuff people see their friends have it and they want it
[01:46:53.960 --> 01:47:00.120]   too not sure you can educate people into taking it up yeah the iot is coming and companies want
[01:47:00.120 --> 01:47:05.560]   people to adopt it but you got to get consumers a use case as for the basket remote problem i
[01:47:05.560 --> 01:47:09.640]   heard something insightful which is that it's got to be something in your house already and there's
[01:47:09.640 --> 01:47:15.400]   only three viable things it's security systems it's the cable company or it's like the h back and
[01:47:15.400 --> 01:47:20.120]   your utilities in your house and those are going to be the platforms and someone's going to have to
[01:47:20.120 --> 01:47:25.160]   piggyback the standard and devices onto that but simply coming in there and expecting a consumer
[01:47:25.160 --> 01:47:30.200]   to adopt it as you can and get a connected light bulb i think that's sort of putting the car
[01:47:30.200 --> 01:47:35.080]   before the horse i think you need to establish a platform on a use case and some buzz and then
[01:47:35.080 --> 01:47:40.840]   people simply putting it in target it's not going to work i think the smartphone or the mobile in
[01:47:40.840 --> 01:47:44.440]   general abstracts a lot of that away though and whether it's apples home kid or brolo
[01:47:44.440 --> 01:47:49.560]   hopefully it'll end up being sort of like android auto or car play or if there's third party vendors
[01:47:49.560 --> 01:47:53.080]   like qnx or something where it doesn't really matter to the person anymore they just get into
[01:47:53.080 --> 01:47:56.840]   the car and if they have android they have a great experience if they have ios they have a great
[01:47:56.840 --> 01:48:00.920]   experience as you start buying more of these things right now i have hu light bulbs and sonos
[01:48:00.920 --> 01:48:05.640]   speakers and a couple of things and they're not great because they're not compatible but they're
[01:48:05.640 --> 01:48:10.280]   all just apps on my phone so all i really need is my phone or my tablet and now my watch a little
[01:48:10.280 --> 01:48:15.960]   bit to control them and as things like android's home automation takes off and home kit takes off
[01:48:15.960 --> 01:48:20.920]   i'll have things like syria or google now and i'll just say syria crash the compound or google now
[01:48:21.480 --> 01:48:26.280]   game time and a lot of it i think i hope will sort of take care of itself because these sorts of
[01:48:26.280 --> 01:48:31.560]   transitions are often matched by transitions in user interface that make things easier and typically
[01:48:31.560 --> 01:48:36.760]   more mainstream than ever before and hopefully we're aligned enough where that those interface
[01:48:36.760 --> 01:48:41.640]   improvements will hit as the same time as things become more connected and smarter in general
[01:48:41.640 --> 01:48:47.320]   yeah you also have to sell to the right people i'll never forget the time when at the my mom
[01:48:47.320 --> 01:48:51.720]   and dad's house i would come over and i set up the christmas decorations and i remember the first
[01:48:51.720 --> 01:48:55.960]   time that i decided that my my folks that had like those little like window candles and every
[01:48:55.960 --> 01:49:00.520]   single one of the street facing windows i remember the first time that i bought a whole bunch of x10
[01:49:00.520 --> 01:49:06.200]   controllers and i showed my mom that now at to at now when you want to turn on the lights i have to
[01:49:06.200 --> 01:49:11.320]   do is push this one button that i left like on the on the end table and the christmas tree lights will
[01:49:11.320 --> 01:49:15.880]   come on and the window lights will come on and she's like oh my god that's so wonderful that's so
[01:49:15.880 --> 01:49:21.000]   was the time say oh how did you do that and then like okay so now that the local anesthetic
[01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:26.280]   has taken effect let's see if i can let's see if she'll go up go for the real ones i now mom with
[01:49:26.280 --> 01:49:34.200]   this i could also plug in this other box that would turn them on and off automatically at the
[01:49:34.200 --> 01:49:38.520]   same time every day and that was going to cause a fire she didn't want she wanted nothing to do
[01:49:38.520 --> 01:49:43.400]   with it so there there are times when like there there are people who love the demo they would love
[01:49:43.400 --> 01:49:48.600]   to attend like the 1962 world's fair and see the push button house of tomorrow but they don't want
[01:49:48.600 --> 01:49:52.360]   to have the push button house of tomorrow they don't they people don't know that they that their
[01:49:52.360 --> 01:49:58.280]   apple tv could actually learn how to use whatever remote you have you you're using for your other tv
[01:49:58.280 --> 01:50:02.760]   but it's simpler and more direct to simply say here is the thing that is shaped like an apple tv
[01:50:02.760 --> 01:50:06.920]   remote i know that this is what controls the apple tv here's the thing that's shaped like my cable
[01:50:06.920 --> 01:50:11.000]   box remote i know that this is the thing that controls the cable box so it's not an easy problem
[01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:15.720]   to solve and i think that it won't start to get solved until people a year from now two years
[01:50:15.720 --> 01:50:20.280]   from now can be told that oh well did you buy you do you have an apple tv yeah i bought one last
[01:50:20.280 --> 01:50:24.760]   year well that has everything you need to do this except for the light bulb so if you want to spend
[01:50:24.760 --> 01:50:28.760]   another four dollars for this light bulb it can do things like make sure that the front light is
[01:50:28.760 --> 01:50:33.080]   always on its sundown and always gets turned off at 11 p.m. is that worth an extra three or four
[01:50:33.080 --> 01:50:39.000]   dollars to you and that's when you get the extra three or four bucks from them and plus you'll get a
[01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:45.240]   lot of fires i'm with your mom on that so so one last thing on this kind of sort of like the
[01:50:45.240 --> 01:50:51.800]   internet of things i guess things that are in your house i got a an amazon echo for father's day
[01:50:51.800 --> 01:50:56.360]   and i've also reviewed it so i was familiar with it well before i got it but i love this thing i
[01:50:56.360 --> 01:51:02.440]   think it's a brilliant plan on on the part of amazon for a number of reasons one of which of course is
[01:51:02.440 --> 01:51:08.520]   that it's a it's a machine that facilitates buying things from amazon it's also great because they
[01:51:08.520 --> 01:51:15.160]   they've got third-party integration so for example you can listen to and and i i won't say the whole
[01:51:15.160 --> 01:51:19.960]   comment because those of you out there who have an amazon echo i don't want to to have it change
[01:51:19.960 --> 01:51:25.080]   the channel on your start talking but basically you can listen to twit live on tune in radio just
[01:51:25.080 --> 01:51:30.920]   by talking you just say you know give the command uh it's the fact that it's an appliance that is
[01:51:30.920 --> 01:51:35.320]   high quality the speaker is very high quality the microphone is very high quality i have it in the
[01:51:35.320 --> 01:51:41.160]   kitchen and i can talk to it from the bedroom and and i can hear its response and everything i mean
[01:51:41.160 --> 01:51:46.520]   it's just great why didn't apple think of this why didn't google think of this why is amazon the
[01:51:46.520 --> 01:51:52.040]   company that's essentially building the uh the the virtual assistant appliance of the future
[01:51:52.040 --> 01:51:57.320]   anyone they have they they have a they have a crazy billionaire ceo
[01:51:57.320 --> 01:52:02.520]   uh which is which is always always helpful sometimes i mean the reason why the amazon
[01:52:02.520 --> 01:52:07.000]   fire phone happened was because the crazy billionaire ceo was the person who's deciding that that's
[01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:11.800]   that's the product they want to make but it's also the crazy billionaire ceo who also decided i want
[01:52:11.800 --> 01:52:16.680]   to make spaceships and now he's also making spaceships i don't know what what uh jeff bezos area of
[01:52:16.680 --> 01:52:21.640]   involvement was in alexa but i would not be surprised if echo but i would not be surprised if it was
[01:52:21.640 --> 01:52:25.960]   another wouldn't this sounds like an interesting idea let's go make this and i i'm with you 100
[01:52:25.960 --> 01:52:31.160]   percent i mean it's clear that google and apple are missing a big trick here the fact that you have
[01:52:31.160 --> 01:52:37.160]   a very powerful omnidirectional microphone that can be reached from several rooms so that
[01:52:37.160 --> 01:52:41.400]   i thought that it was a big convenience when i got the mode of 360 and when i got the apple watch to
[01:52:41.400 --> 01:52:47.160]   be able to like set a kitchen timer just by doing this and speaking some words but the ability to
[01:52:47.160 --> 01:52:52.760]   simply as i'm closing the door to the oven on the chicken that's going to take about 25 minutes to
[01:52:52.760 --> 01:52:57.880]   cook to simply say alexa set of time for 20 minutes and i'm not even thinking about it might be looking
[01:52:57.880 --> 01:53:03.800]   at it but 20 minutes later i'm going to get an alert uh it is so if and it would be so simple if apple
[01:53:03.800 --> 01:53:10.600]   just produced a 90 even a $99 box exactly like this that was nothing but a really good microphone
[01:53:10.600 --> 01:53:17.240]   that gives us access to syri from wherever the speaking voice works that would so amplify the
[01:53:17.240 --> 01:53:22.440]   power of that feature immensely i i think it's i it was a little bit like google glass i had to
[01:53:22.440 --> 01:53:27.320]   actually have it in the house and be using it to realize that oh they've got something here they
[01:53:27.320 --> 01:53:30.920]   really got something here but my my theory is that apple is not ever going to get into this
[01:53:30.920 --> 01:53:37.000]   business i think they they will enable uh the apple tv or the future of apple tv to do this sort of
[01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:42.520]   functionality but the problem is that a product like this is software upgradable so for example
[01:53:42.520 --> 01:53:48.840]   once you buy an amazon amazon echo you never need to upgrade it they will improve it on in the cloud
[01:53:48.840 --> 01:53:54.120]   the software the algorithms the servers all that stuff is how you improve it you won't need a
[01:53:54.120 --> 01:53:58.920]   better speaker in the future you won't need a better microphone microphone unless it breaks
[01:53:58.920 --> 01:54:02.840]   you only need to buy one and that is not an apple style business that's one of the problems
[01:54:02.840 --> 01:54:06.840]   they're having with the ipad which is that you really only need one and it's going to be perfectly
[01:54:06.840 --> 01:54:11.480]   good for years the thing about if i can defend apple and google uh for a minute here is that
[01:54:11.480 --> 01:54:16.200]   they they are operating differently than amazon it's sort of like why did amazon have better screens
[01:54:16.200 --> 01:54:19.720]   in their tablets before apple or google well you can have these better screens when you're making
[01:54:19.720 --> 01:54:23.400]   five when you're making five hundred million it's much harder to make those kinds of screens and
[01:54:23.400 --> 01:54:28.360]   amazon as a company is interesting to me because i'm i'm outside the us and amazon is one of those
[01:54:28.360 --> 01:54:32.040]   companies where i think it's incredibly us centric the kind of coverage they get like i just looked
[01:54:32.040 --> 01:54:36.840]   at amazon dossier there's no echo there there's no mp3 here there amazon prime here is just about
[01:54:36.840 --> 01:54:43.160]   deliveries uh the amount of services they offer outside the us is incredibly incredibly small and
[01:54:43.160 --> 01:54:47.400]   that allows them a huge amount of flexibility if you're making a phone for one country if you're
[01:54:47.400 --> 01:54:53.160]   making a device like this for one country the needs you have to serve are much much smaller now google
[01:54:53.160 --> 01:54:58.120]   and apple absolutely have these products apple is looking at this differently they're looking at it
[01:54:58.120 --> 01:55:03.320]   in an apple way like you said a next generation apple tv that has theory built in uh maybe it's
[01:55:03.320 --> 01:55:07.240]   not just a box that does it but it's a box that does it while it does home kit like for the internet
[01:55:07.240 --> 01:55:12.680]   of things and while it does television services it by the way also has this functionality that you
[01:55:12.680 --> 01:55:17.240]   can access by siri and google's had many different home initiatives and likely will have more and
[01:55:17.240 --> 01:55:21.960]   google now is a mainstay of their services so it's almost certain that eventually you'll have the
[01:55:21.960 --> 01:55:27.160]   google now box whether it's bundled in your tv or into your refrigerator or your dishwasher or who
[01:55:27.160 --> 01:55:31.080]   knows but when you're making that product that's international that has to serve all sorts of
[01:55:31.080 --> 01:55:35.720]   different languages and interests and and different services that are bundled into it it is a much
[01:55:35.720 --> 01:55:40.520]   harder problem to solve now maybe the apple tv should have shipped two years ago but they're waiting on
[01:55:40.520 --> 01:55:44.840]   you know content deals or or something else and maybe google's trying several different things to
[01:55:44.840 --> 01:55:51.240]   try and get it right uh but we will absolutely see it i just think that judging apple or google by
[01:55:51.240 --> 01:55:57.080]   by the same sort of strategy that amazon employs uh is only really relevant in the u.s right now
[01:55:57.080 --> 01:56:03.880]   well okay but the the thing is apple is capable of doing anything they want to do there is no
[01:56:03.880 --> 01:56:07.960]   problem they cannot solve there's no product that if they think it's important for them to make
[01:56:07.960 --> 01:56:13.800]   they cannot ship they're making a ten thousand dollar damn gadget watch that's internationally
[01:56:13.800 --> 01:56:18.440]   andy you can get in china well they're they're selling them to people in india
[01:56:19.640 --> 01:56:25.000]   but i think i i think it has i i don't think that it's a lack of creativity or anything like that
[01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:29.720]   i do think that this this feels like a small potato's device for apple it's the same reason
[01:56:29.720 --> 01:56:35.000]   why they haven't done an improvement upon their wireless keyboard uh since really since version
[01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:43.560]   1.0 of this thing despite the fact that the ipad is the the the the utility of the ipad opens up
[01:56:43.560 --> 01:56:48.840]   immensely once you pair it with a decent bluetooth keyboard i mean i would love to if the rumors of
[01:56:48.840 --> 01:56:53.480]   apple doing an ipad pro come to fruition later this year i would love nothing more than for them to
[01:56:53.480 --> 01:56:59.080]   introduce the ipad pro alongside and by the way we've made a keyboard that we think shows you exactly
[01:56:59.080 --> 01:57:03.720]   how much you can do with our five hundred dollar ipad ear three or ipad pro or whatever you're
[01:57:03.720 --> 01:57:07.080]   going to call it i just think that the reason why they're not going to make a device like this is
[01:57:07.080 --> 01:57:14.360]   because they don't they're they're not intrinsically an accessory sort of company they are a 20 minutes
[01:57:14.360 --> 01:57:20.120]   in the keynote with a video of people talking about again chamfer angle angles and material
[01:57:20.120 --> 01:57:25.480]   material choices and you can't really do it's got a microphone and oh it's got a wall adapter
[01:57:25.480 --> 01:57:31.560]   so we can plug it into your wall it's made it it's made out of aluminium handy uh so is there
[01:57:31.560 --> 01:57:35.720]   anything else you guys want to talk about before we wrap this thing up uh i'll throw that open if
[01:57:35.720 --> 01:57:43.160]   anybody has anything oh sorry not really apple music is still hit or miss for me i'm liking it
[01:57:43.160 --> 01:57:49.560]   more but it's it's it's it's it's it's highs and lows for me uh i did back up absolutely everything
[01:57:49.560 --> 01:57:54.920]   in my library copied it to a hard drive then unplug that hard drive before upgrading to the
[01:57:54.920 --> 01:58:01.400]   new i2s uh and it seems to have been a really good transition for me so far uh but it's like it really
[01:58:01.400 --> 01:58:06.280]   is like moving into a new house where immediately you oh my god there's so much light in the living
[01:58:06.280 --> 01:58:11.800]   room we're going to have coffee in the living room all the time now and then you realize oh so i can't
[01:58:11.800 --> 01:58:18.840]   run the shower and the dishwasher at the same time that's new isn't that you know since you brought
[01:58:18.840 --> 01:58:24.200]   up apple music i have to say that uh and i think that uh i'm sure that uh we've been in this conversation
[01:58:24.200 --> 01:58:30.200]   together at some point uh as apple was rolling this thing out but i have been i had been very bullish
[01:58:30.200 --> 01:58:37.960]   on connect the connect feature and very down on bbc on bbc one yeah beats one beats one music
[01:58:37.960 --> 01:58:44.920]   and every common mistake yeah it's not hard to do uh and they these samsung bbc let's just
[01:58:44.920 --> 01:58:51.240]   come and say that apple has samsung bbc one exactly i will we did eventually learn to stop saying i
[01:58:51.240 --> 01:58:57.800]   watch so there's hope uh but uh but of course now my my opinion is is been reversed it connect just
[01:58:57.800 --> 01:59:03.800]   seems like a non-starter and beats one seems brilliant to me uh brilliant because essentially
[01:59:03.800 --> 01:59:12.440]   that this global radio station it's a rare event uh in you know it's a rare medium uh where you
[01:59:12.440 --> 01:59:16.840]   have this global shared experience that's not an event so for example yeah when there's the world
[01:59:16.840 --> 01:59:21.880]   cup or the oscars or something like that yeah the whole world is kind of experiencing a single event
[01:59:21.880 --> 01:59:28.600]   but this is the only medium that i'm aware of where a critical mass of people lots and lots and lots
[01:59:28.600 --> 01:59:34.760]   of people are all listening to the same thing more or less at the same time that's its main value to
[01:59:34.760 --> 01:59:40.360]   me plus you know the the curation is very very skillfully done and it's a it's a fantastic
[01:59:40.360 --> 01:59:48.280]   marketing tool for apple to drive people into the paid services around music for and so on and so
[01:59:48.280 --> 01:59:54.520]   i just think beats one is absolutely brilliant my question to you guys is maybe you know why are
[01:59:54.520 --> 02:00:02.120]   they selling ads on it and why aren't they fully live 24/7 you know we were just any you were just
[02:00:02.120 --> 02:00:06.520]   saying that you know apple can do anything they have very deep pockets it seems like the super
[02:00:06.520 --> 02:00:15.240]   home run here would have been 24/7 live radio and no ads why didn't they do that i think because
[02:00:15.240 --> 02:00:20.920]   when every time they talk about uh about competing music streaming services a lot of the deep cuts
[02:00:20.920 --> 02:00:26.040]   inside that interview is that's nice but how are they making money uh they're as deep pocketed as
[02:00:26.040 --> 02:00:32.680]   they are they're not going to simply run uh apple music as a conservancy they have to make sure that
[02:00:32.680 --> 02:00:37.480]   it makes money each and every time they have a sustainable model for everything i don't understand
[02:00:37.480 --> 02:00:41.720]   anything about the music business deeper than that but i suspect that it really is about we have to
[02:00:41.720 --> 02:00:46.440]   make this a self-supporting service we can't just simply be uh shoveling money into it year after year
[02:00:46.440 --> 02:00:50.600]   after year because that's not a business that's just simply a that's a vanity project that that
[02:00:50.600 --> 02:00:54.600]   that is indeed running it like a hobby well that that is apple's thing where they make money out
[02:00:54.600 --> 02:00:59.000]   for they they're not into like uh the amazon model where you lose money over here so you can
[02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:03.320]   make it up elsewhere they want to make money at every single point the content that you know all
[02:01:03.320 --> 02:01:10.120]   of it but it still there's lots of money to be made in driving beats one listeners which is free
[02:01:10.120 --> 02:01:15.160]   you know to the paid version of apple music that's got to be the huge you know far more lucrative than
[02:01:15.160 --> 02:01:20.280]   the you know bank of america ads i think it's also like apple doesn't have profit and loss across
[02:01:20.280 --> 02:01:24.440]   divisions where some company does and for example the chipsets you never hear about how much money
[02:01:24.440 --> 02:01:28.520]   a chipset makes it apple like the a-x or something because it's not relevant they don't have to sell
[02:01:28.520 --> 02:01:33.240]   that chipset to anybody but apple so you you could have a model inside apple where they decide that
[02:01:33.240 --> 02:01:37.320]   this is such a core technology that they're just going to pay for it and not you know and enjoy the
[02:01:37.320 --> 02:01:41.640]   benefits of that in other parts of the business but i think it's it's much more realistic than that
[02:01:41.640 --> 02:01:45.400]   apple there's not that many zane lows like maybe apple could hire a bunch more deejays
[02:01:45.400 --> 02:01:49.400]   but at a certain point you want this is like an artistic endeavor for them in some ways and it
[02:01:49.400 --> 02:01:54.280]   sounds corny but they really want people like zane low who's who are almost like appointment
[02:01:54.280 --> 02:01:59.080]   listening you want these amazing deejays on there and you want to have few enough of them that people
[02:01:59.080 --> 02:02:03.000]   can identify that they're waiting that they're interested in what these people have to say and if
[02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:08.280]   you have enough of them to scale 24/7 immediately that's sort of diluted it's much better to sort
[02:02:08.280 --> 02:02:13.560]   of start small and introduce a lot of a couple big personalities and then build out from there
[02:02:13.560 --> 02:02:18.280]   the ads are sort of like the way a radio sort of run i guess maybe you know they can make it
[02:02:18.280 --> 02:02:23.000]   profitable so why not but i think the idea of having a few people to start off with is the kind of
[02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:27.880]   patience and restraint that apple because of their affluence can really afford to take and that is
[02:02:27.880 --> 02:02:32.200]   start slowly and ramp it up from there and we talked about this on mac break i'm wondering if
[02:02:32.200 --> 02:02:37.480]   we'll see beats two classic beats three metal at some point if this model proves lucrative enough for
[02:02:37.480 --> 02:02:42.600]   them i think the model is to not do that i think the brilliant thing about this model is that there
[02:02:42.600 --> 02:02:47.880]   is one and and if they spin it off into multiple channels to try to satisfy multiple markets i
[02:02:47.880 --> 02:02:52.120]   think they've lost what was great about it then then they're just doing internet radio like everybody
[02:02:52.120 --> 02:02:58.520]   else uh but to have the one single channel that every apple enthusiast you know lots of people who
[02:02:58.520 --> 02:03:02.360]   want to be associated with the apple brand who like zane low whatever they're all this in the same
[02:03:02.360 --> 02:03:06.680]   thing i think that that's the model but that that's just uh my opinion i i don't know what you guys
[02:03:06.680 --> 02:03:12.600]   think about it's too mandarin yeah all right well let's wrap it up andi and nacho is technology
