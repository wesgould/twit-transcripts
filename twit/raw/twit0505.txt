[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.360]   So glad Jason Stuck could be here this Sunday.
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.560]   I'm here in person.
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.560]   Yay.
[00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:57.560]   Thanks for having me.
[00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.560]   Thanks for coming in.
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.880]   You don't have an Apple watch but you have a MacBook.
[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.280]   I do have a MacBook.
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.280]   Space gray.
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.280]   Good enough.
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.280]   I'll take it.
[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.280]   Fancy.
[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.280]   We'll talk about that in just a second.
[00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.520]   Also here from Taiwan and Stretecherie Ben Thompson.
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:10.520]   Good to have you.
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.520]   Good to be here.
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.720]   Very early in the morning.
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.720]   6am.
[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.920]   Thank you for putting on this shirt for us.
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.320]   I realize it's doing some, what's the word?
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:19.320]   The more.
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.320]   The more.
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.320]   The more.
[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:22.320]   Yeah.
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.320]   That's okay.
[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.640]   And you know we can read your super secret notes on your whiteboard behind you.
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:27.640]   No, it's okay.
[00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.720]   I already wrote that article.
[00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.120]   Ben is an amazing analyst and I love having you on and if you are not yet subscribing
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.040]   to his newsletters, Stretecherie, you must.
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.600]   You must.
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.600]   Also with us from Business Insider, the great Steve Kovac.
[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:44.880]   We got a great panel here.
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:45.880]   Hi guys.
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:46.880]   Hi.
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:47.880]   Welcome.
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:54.680]   International in honor of Apple Watch Day, maybe better in honor of Game of Thrones Day.
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.680]   I like that better.
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:57.680]   There we go.
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.360]   I was thinking this is a terrible night because Game of Thrones, Silicon Valley and V premiere
[00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.200]   on HBO.
[00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:10.800]   But there's Mad Men episode two on AMC and The Good Wife.
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:11.800]   They wouldn't.
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.960]   And Daredevil is on Netflix.
[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:14.960]   Yeah.
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.240]   I have one of those teavos with the six tuners.
[00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:18.240]   Well that's the thing.
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.400]   I think they would in years gone by.
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.040]   They would have never done this.
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.700]   They would have carefully programmed this and you only go head to head if you really
[00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.960]   want to, you know, sock, but everybody watches on demand now.
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:28.960]   Nobody cares.
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:34.680]   It'll be interesting to watch tonight because this is the first big night for HBO now.
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:35.680]   Oh man.
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.480]   This is the over the top app HBO ships on only on Apple right now.
[00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.720]   Although in three months it'll be the exclusive will be over.
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.600]   But right now on iTunes, not iTunes.
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:45.600]   Yeah.
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.240]   And on Apple TV you can get it.
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.240]   Although it's funny.
[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.240]   I've heard some people say that it's not actually true, that it's the exclusive.
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:58.440]   It's the exclusive for HBO now, but they're, but sling let's you get HBO.
[00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:04.320]   So it's sort of over the top, but it's like regular HBO because sling is considered a
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.160]   TV provider, right?
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.160]   Right.
[00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:08.160]   It's not on demand.
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.160]   Exactly.
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.560]   But HBO now through the Apple devices is sort of in a different thing, but it's going to
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.520]   be interesting to see if the internet grinds to a halt at 9 p.m. Eastern when Game of Thrones
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:18.520]   comes on.
[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:19.520]   It did last year, remember.
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:22.280]   Oh, HBO Go did not make it.
[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.000]   And HBO dismantled that multi-million dollar project they had up in Seattle.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.720]   They'd hired a bunch of Amazon engineers.
[00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:28.720]   Yeah.
[00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.640]   And their CTO basically exited the company and they're using major league baseball advanced
[00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:34.360]   media for the streaming of HBO now, which is funny.
[00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.960]   If you're, if you're not a baseball fan, you might think that's totally random.
[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:38.960]   Why are they using that?
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:44.200]   It turns out major league baseball advanced media is maybe the best.
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.040]   It's certainly one of the best video distribution mechanisms.
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.560]   CBS uses it for all of its sports broadcasts.
[00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.560]   I believe ESPN is still using it for all of its streaming.
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.480]   They have been, they have been using, they've had other clients for a long time.
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.160]   It's not just a baseball streaming service.
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:02.640]   And they've got this huge infrastructure I've been in their building in New York City that
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.840]   has this just huge streaming infrastructure that they built.
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.920]   Do they have their own CDN or do they use Akamai or something?
[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:09.920]   That I don't know.
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:14.520]   I mean, their own infrastructure is gigantic and then they probably have CDN partners too,
[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:15.600]   but I don't know that offhand.
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.960]   But it's an amazing company actually.
[00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:22.840]   And so it's funny that HBO has drawn a little more attention to it because this is one of
[00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:27.120]   the great benefits baseball had of having the foresight to embrace digital technology
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:31.800]   earlier than most other sports leagues did.
[00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:32.880]   And they invested in the tech.
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:37.760]   And now you've got big media companies like Time Warner with HBO now coming to them and
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.040]   saying, please help us.
[00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.040]   So we'll see how they hold up.
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.400]   It is a surprise, isn't it?
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.680]   Yeah, it's funny how that is.
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:47.880]   But baseball, the, you know, that, that, that rural pastoral game.
[00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.040]   Turns out it'd be pretty high tech.
[00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:51.920]   They did some really smart things with their tech.
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:55.400]   Well, sling TV had trouble with March Madness, the NCAA tournament.
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:00.600]   Apparently people will use sling TV to watch ESPN saw it had buffering and stuttering and
[00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:01.600]   it wasn't a good experience.
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:02.600]   You saw that in the World Cup.
[00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:07.600]   We, I don't know, you know, it's interest here is outpacing the ability of these
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.040]   streaming services, I think, to, to really catch up.
[00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:14.200]   We've seen that Apple did some live streams of their events early and then they stopped
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:15.200]   for a while.
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:16.200]   Yeah, and everybody I found them.
[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:17.680]   I think they realized that they couldn't, they couldn't manage it.
[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:20.280]   And then when they came back, they struggled to get it down.
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:21.760]   Chinese translation in the back.
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:22.760]   The video is hard.
[00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:25.560]   If a lot of people, I mean, if there's demand, it can be really hard.
[00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:26.560]   Yeah.
[00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.200]   Well, it's a very different model than the broadcast model.
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:32.760]   It doesn't matter if you've got a transmitter in an antenna.
[00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:36.240]   If one person watches or a million, it's the same bandwidth from your point of view.
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:37.240]   Right.
[00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:38.840]   It's really upside down for streaming.
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:41.560]   Now, cable kind of is more, is a little bit like streaming.
[00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:45.800]   I mean, but, but this so distributed that I think the cable companies don't have to
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:52.440]   worry so much about this HBO decided to launch Game of Thrones in 170 countries this year.
[00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:58.680]   It was the most pirated TV show of last year hoping that they will stay part of this year.
[00:06:58.680 --> 00:06:59.680]   And guess what?
[00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.000]   I already started.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.600]   Can you, can you watch it in Taiwan?
[00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:05.280]   Is it on somewhere in Taiwan, Ben?
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:08.520]   I'm not sure.
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:11.120]   People ask me how I get a lot of stuff done.
[00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:13.400]   And the one reason is I don't watch TV.
[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:14.400]   Watch TV.
[00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.520]   That's why I get very little done myself.
[00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:21.400]   I prefer to watch TV to actually doing anything.
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:24.600]   But I presume it's going to be all 170 countries.
[00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:27.680]   It doesn't leave many out.
[00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:32.720]   But already, the first four episodes have been leaked to the BitTarns.
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:34.320]   You can get them on Pirate Bay.
[00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:35.320]   Not HDSD.
[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:39.240]   The thinking is it's the review copies that were sent out.
[00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:40.400]   The DVDs here.
[00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:41.400]   Yeah.
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:42.400]   Well.
[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:45.200]   I know a TV critic and I know that they got the four episodes.
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:46.200]   Right.
[00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:50.560]   I actually saw the screeners of the first year before it came on.
[00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:54.560]   And these are, these seem to be a little more recent than the ones I saw in year one
[00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:56.600]   where they were missing effects.
[00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:01.040]   It looks like maybe the effects are all there, but it's still, it's a standard, it's an inferior
[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:06.040]   experience.
[00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:07.040]   But if people really want to see those four episodes early, I guess they're going to go
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:08.040]   ahead and do it.
[00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:13.080]   I'd rather watch it in HD with everything locked down and final.
[00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:16.480]   So have you watched Daredevil, the TV series on Netflix?
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:18.280]   Steve, or has you just brought it up to be?
[00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:19.280]   Yeah.
[00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:21.480]   I've watched the first three episodes.
[00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:22.920]   People are raving about it.
[00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:23.920]   It's really good.
[00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:28.040]   The second episode, especially I was blown away.
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:30.920]   We put this story up on the site today.
[00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:36.080]   There's this one fight scene that they do in all one shot and it's just absolutely brilliant.
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:37.640]   They did a really, really good job.
[00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:43.560]   And it ties into the other Marvel movies and TV shows and it's really good.
[00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:46.400]   If you have time to watch it, you definitely should.
[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:47.400]   It's must watch.
[00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:48.400]   I agree.
[00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:49.400]   Even if you don't like Marvel.
[00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:52.160]   It's not like any of the other Marvel stuff.
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:56.800]   It's a TV MA, it's grittier, it's darker, it's more violent, like realistic violence
[00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:58.960]   instead of sort of cartoonish violence.
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:04.040]   And what I like about it is the ramifications of the violence are not ignored.
[00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:08.400]   Like if a guy gets in a fight, he's hurt afterward and in pain.
[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:14.160]   And I like that that there's a, you know, violence has consequences.
[00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:17.960]   And that's one of the things that happens in Daredevil.
[00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:18.960]   Now I have another show.
[00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:20.400]   But I'm not gonna ask that.
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:21.600]   I'm really not gonna get anything.
[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.520]   It's nothing for Ben not to watch.
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:25.280]   You won't be disappointed.
[00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:31.600]   So it's, days like today, like premiering Game of Thrones, like I always have like a
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:33.240]   win to regret like all it'd be.
[00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:35.760]   Or whatever like the big things happen.
[00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:40.440]   But no, the only one, the one that I have kind of kept up on is Mad Men.
[00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:42.640]   So I have that for it too.
[00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:46.440]   It's kind of even more incomprehensible this year.
[00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:48.720]   This season, I can't figure out what the hell's going on.
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:51.160]   But I do like the style.
[00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:52.160]   I like the era.
[00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:53.440]   I like the period.
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:55.000]   So Daredevil, when did it come out?
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   It was all Friday.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.800]   It was the same minute that the Apple Watch went on sale.
[00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:03.200]   And the digital editions for the first time ever of Star Wars.
[00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:04.200]   Yeah.
[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:05.200]   Mm hmm.
[00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:07.400]   They really don't want us to get anything done, do they?
[00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:08.400]   Nope.
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:09.880]   They want your money.
[00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:10.880]   Who are they?
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:11.880]   These people.
[00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:12.880]   Wow.
[00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:13.880]   All right.
[00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:14.880]   Let's talk.
[00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:17.080]   It's the Watch Marvel Axis Complex.
[00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:18.080]   Yes.
[00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:19.560]   The Axis of evil.
[00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:22.160]   The Apple Marvel Complex.
[00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:23.160]   So now I have to watch Daredevil.
[00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:26.600]   Yeah, I said a lot of Twitter chatter about people saying it's darker than the Dark Knight
[00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:27.600]   is really good.
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:29.280]   I don't know what they're talking about.
[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:34.000]   Twitter is great for the keeping up though on what the crowd is talking about.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.240]   You know there's something going on.
[00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:36.240]   All right.
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:37.960]   Let's say I've been putting off talking about the Watch.
[00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:40.360]   Let's talk about the Watch.
[00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:43.240]   Friday, 12-01 Pacific time.
[00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:46.120]   I feel so bad for anybody who's not in California.
[00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:49.680]   3 AM if you're in the East Coast.
[00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:50.920]   Apple opened the store.
[00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:54.200]   10 minutes later sold out.
[00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:56.800]   Pretty close to sold out, right?
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:57.800]   Yeah.
[00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:00.040]   So I bet you Ben, you must be following this a little bit.
[00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:07.280]   Is this a lack of supply, unexpected demand, an ability to produce them rapidly enough?
[00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:08.280]   What's going on?
[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:11.480]   We don't know of course, but do you have a thought?
[00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:12.480]   You just said my thought.
[00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:14.120]   No, we have no idea.
[00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:20.280]   I mean, obviously it's some combination of women that supply and excess demand, but that's
[00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:23.320]   like saying 2 plus 2 is 4.
[00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:27.240]   So it's hard to say.
[00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:33.600]   I think it's clearly, I mean this is as you would expect I guess from many new part from
[00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:37.120]   Apple, you know, it's very much in high demand.
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:40.920]   It's sold out everywhere, not just in the US also in China.
[00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:42.720]   They watched in China the first week.
[00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:47.640]   You know, something to keep in mind is they did that for the first time with the, this
[00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:51.760]   is really the first time actually because they plan to do it with the iPhone 6, but it was
[00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:54.760]   delayed in China.
[00:11:54.760 --> 00:12:00.800]   So no, I mean, I'm sure Apple would prefer everyone to think that it's massive demand,
[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:02.520]   but I mean, we don't know.
[00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:06.520]   It'd be as you see, if Apple does a press release on Monday saying how many they sold.
[00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:08.440]   Is there a president for that?
[00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:09.440]   Oh, yeah.
[00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:10.440]   Yeah.
[00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:11.440]   Yeah.
[00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:12.440]   Yeah.
[00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:13.440]   They used, they often do.
[00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:19.440]   If they do, I'm sure that, you know, the interpretation would be that it's, it's, it's
[00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:20.440]   success demand.
[00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:27.320]   Even the most expensive, the $17,000 gold edition sold out till June.
[00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:29.840]   Well, I think there's a question of whether they were.
[00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:33.400]   It said August at first when I first signed in and said August and then they've downgraded
[00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:34.400]   it to June.
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:36.400]   Do you think they hadn't made any except for Katy Perry and Ferel?
[00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:41.520]   They said that they were going to be later to ship the editions.
[00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:42.840]   So maybe they can't crank these out.
[00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:47.880]   This is, this is the one I would buy if I had $17,000, but who has 17?
[00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:50.120]   So obviously somebody has 17,000.
[00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:56.080]   So everything across the board is you look at the sport, the edition, the stainless steel,
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:59.280]   almost all of them are now June, whatever June means.
[00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:01.080]   I don't know if that's June 1st, June 30th.
[00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:04.920]   Well, I would remind 15 minutes into the order period and got mid, got mid May.
[00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:08.760]   I got the, the, the, the, the, the S base gray sport edition, which just seems to be the
[00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:10.920]   nerd, uh, watch of choice.
[00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:11.920]   Okay.
[00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:13.640]   And even know that I was a stereotype.
[00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:15.960]   Turns out, yeah, I'm a stereotype.
[00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:18.400]   And, uh, yeah, mid May is what I got.
[00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:24.120]   I was, uh, I, I, I overslept and I woke up at 12 on nine, the apple fanatic inside.
[00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:25.560]   Maybe my eyes went, whoa.
[00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:28.600]   And I ran to the computer, which I had pre-configured.
[00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:29.600]   I had it all set up.
[00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:35.400]   I had the app store, uh, the Apple store running in the app on an iPad on an iPhone and on
[00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:39.280]   my computer, I had it and I had already favorited the two that we want to get because I'm going
[00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:42.080]   to get one for Lisa and one for me.
[00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:46.080]   And I was very fortunate because Lisa wanted a 38 millimeter steel.
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:52.000]   I want the 42, the 42 back ordered as well to May, but I got April 24th on the April 24th
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   to May 7th.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   I don't understand what that is.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.840]   So, so, so that was really interesting was that it went, um, on the app store or on the
[00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:00.680]   apps, it was available at midnight.
[00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:02.960]   It didn't go up on the web in 1208.
[00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:05.160]   That happened with the iPhone as well.
[00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:06.160]   It did.
[00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:07.160]   It did.
[00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:11.800]   And I was very mileage stretched out because, well, one, it's not shipping until I want
[00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:12.800]   to start.
[00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:17.200]   So I have to ship it to the US first and then get chipped over.
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:20.040]   But two, uh, I was, I was on the web.
[00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:21.400]   It's three in the afternoon for me.
[00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:23.200]   So I'm at my desk anyway.
[00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:25.040]   I had pulled my phone into it.
[00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:31.640]   Why do I'm curious if that was intentional to drive people to use the app more?
[00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:34.240]   One that's interesting is you, you could pay with Apple Pay.
[00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:38.520]   And I wonder if for a lot of people that is the first time using Apple Pay outside of
[00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:40.280]   the app store.
[00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:42.800]   Um, and it was the first time for me.
[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:45.320]   And to be frank, it was, it was pretty amazing.
[00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:50.680]   Like you, you could have ordered the watch you wanted in like less than 15 seconds.
[00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:55.680]   Um, so I'm curious if that was intentional or just was an accident or what?
[00:14:55.680 --> 00:15:00.640]   But I mean, for me, anyway, it was effective in getting me to actually use Apple Pay to
[00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:02.440]   pay for a physical object.
[00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:04.000]   And it was a very impressive demo.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.080]   This is not the first time this is, this has happened a bunch of times now.
[00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:10.760]   And it seems to me that there's something in the Apple's infrastructure where the store
[00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:15.760]   back end goes up and the app is directly hooked into that back end.
[00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:19.480]   But the web front end goes up later.
[00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:23.840]   And this has happened three or four times at least to the point where it's like the open
[00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:27.880]   secret now that if you really want to buy an Apple product, the moment it goes on sale,
[00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:29.440]   use the Apple store app on iOS.
[00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:30.440]   Yeah.
[00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:31.440]   Yeah.
[00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:32.440]   I mean, it makes sense.
[00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:35.680]   You know, it's all API based, but the front end is a propagate.
[00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:37.240]   Um, no, it makes sense from a tech.
[00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:38.400]   We're second, that'd be the case.
[00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:41.280]   But unfortunately, the open secret was forgotten by me.
[00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:45.960]   So I saw, I saw the 24th ship date, but it was funny.
[00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:48.360]   I was, I was very stressed out.
[00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:51.880]   And also, like for some reason, the app store is my wrong address and I can't get it to
[00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:52.880]   update.
[00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:55.440]   So every time I order, I have to change the address.
[00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:59.160]   So I was changing the address and like, I was like, you know, fun little thing of like,
[00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:00.160]   hurry, hurry, hurry.
[00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:01.400]   It's like James Bond.
[00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:03.960]   The bomb is ticking down.
[00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:05.120]   Apple paid didn't work for me.
[00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:06.680]   Cause like my thumb got sweaty.
[00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:08.680]   Oh, that's weird.
[00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:10.880]   It's a, I see a movie here.
[00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:14.800]   It's like, yeah.
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:20.360]   So I, if I had to guess, you know, there was kind of an open question, whether the Apple
[00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:27.760]   watch as is, as is, as a luxury and as a new category would sell as well as an iPhone.
[00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:29.640]   And it's in the initial blush.
[00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:32.760]   I think a lot of people counsel, oh, wait to the next generation.
[00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:34.240]   No, don't rush.
[00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:39.360]   I would guess that this, that the demand outpaced Apple's expectations.
[00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:42.760]   They, the rumor of course to the Wall Street Journal published was that they made five
[00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:45.080]   or five and a half million.
[00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:49.200]   I would, obviously they're going to go back and make as many as they can as fast as they
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:50.200]   can.
[00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:51.200]   We don't know.
[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:52.200]   It may be they made one, made two.
[00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:53.200]   I don't know.
[00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:56.360]   But I, my guess is they sold five million in the first minute or two.
[00:16:56.360 --> 00:17:00.320]   I mean, well, I think just, I think just like Jason probably put a much wiser technical
[00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:05.000]   explanation to my, my surmising about backroom thinking is probably the same thing here.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.320]   I mean, the reality is, is ramping is very difficult and ramping a brand new product
[00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:10.320]   is even more.
[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:12.440]   But nobody knows how to do this better than Apple.
[00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:13.440]   They've got rent.
[00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:14.960]   Right now experience.
[00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:15.960]   Sure.
[00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:19.800]   But I mean, it doesn't change like it's like a physics problem.
[00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:24.160]   Like you can't like the speed of light is a constraint, like gravity is a constraint.
[00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:26.560]   Like no, it's like that when it comes to manufacturing.
[00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:30.680]   Like there is just fundamental constraints when it comes to making and ramping a new
[00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:31.680]   product.
[00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:37.400]   And we've never had a company of the scale of Apple, the demand that Apple generates,
[00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:38.400]   launch a new product ever.
[00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:41.400]   I mean, because if you have to remember the iPhone, like Apple wasn't at all the company
[00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:45.920]   that it is now, even the iPad.
[00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:52.920]   And whereas today just the demand for anything they sell is so overwhelming that I, I'm
[00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:57.320]   sure that no matter if they had estimated to be 100 million sold, I bet it would still
[00:17:57.320 --> 00:18:01.920]   be sold out just for the very kind of the constraints that come with building a brand
[00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:02.920]   new product.
[00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:06.360]   I think strategically, if you're Apple, you want to release the product at a point where
[00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:08.920]   you can ship a decent number of them.
[00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:11.560]   But you don't want to wait to the point where you can fulfill all demand anyway.
[00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:16.280]   You want to you want to have some backlog, I think, because otherwise you've waited too
[00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:17.280]   long.
[00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:19.240]   I would I would say kind of one of the other.
[00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:21.400]   If somebody's waiving money at you, you want to take it.
[00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:24.000]   They took it and then they'll give you your watch later.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   Okay.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   Yeah, that's a good point.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:31.360]   Well, the issue is that to to meet demand in like, because the demands always highest
[00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:34.320]   in the first quarter that something that's held typically, I may be able to be the case
[00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:37.960]   with a new different than with a new product, but say an iPhone, for example, if you want
[00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:43.680]   to meet that demand in the first quarter, it's extremely inefficient and a very poor
[00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:48.640]   user capital because the problem is all that capacity is then going to be severely underused
[00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:49.720]   the rest of the year.
[00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:53.000]   So it's a very difficult balancing act.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:19:00.200]   I suspect actually that with the iPhone anyway, if you'll notice the date of the physical week
[00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:03.880]   of the phone with the phone looks like from a physical perspective, which almost certainly
[00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:07.680]   is going from the supply chain, it's actually getting earlier and earlier every year.
[00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:10.880]   So this year, the first week of the iPhone six was in February.
[00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:12.880]   The first thing the five S was like in March.
[00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:14.720]   Because they're starting earlier and earlier.
[00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:19.040]   I think that's what's happening is there they're actually ramping earlier and earlier because
[00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:24.640]   they want to have us, if you build enough capacity to satisfy first quarter demand, like
[00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:25.960]   I said, you're wasting money.
[00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:29.960]   So I think they're trying to start earlier and earlier so they can have stuff pent up.
[00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:33.760]   And they sold 75 million in the first quarter last year, which is insane.
[00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:35.720]   But they still didn't meet demand.
[00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:40.160]   So I mean, it's a good problem to have in some respects, but it's a problem that no
[00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:45.280]   one in any industry really has ever had to face.
[00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:48.040]   Steve, you're getting yours tomorrow?
[00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:49.680]   No, next week.
[00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:52.240]   But I think, and this could be a review net from Apple.
[00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:56.040]   I even tried to order it because, well, first of all, I'm not sure I want to own one in the
[00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:57.240]   first place.
[00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:01.600]   But second of all, I think like if they really did make five million of that initial shipment,
[00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:06.120]   we're going to hear about it on Monday because they don't really have a precedent for like
[00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:07.560]   bragging about these kinds of things.
[00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:11.520]   There's kind of a reason why they haven't been saying those opening weekend iPad numbers.
[00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:15.480]   I think the last two years may be correct me if I'm wrong with you guys, but it's because
[00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:20.040]   those sales are kind of going down, whereas iPhone sales, each opening weekend is bigger
[00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:22.640]   than the previous year.
[00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:27.520]   This if they can sell five million, wow, that's more than any of other smart watchmaker has
[00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:28.520]   made ever, right?
[00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:31.520]   Pebble has only sold about a million, I think.
[00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:35.160]   700,000 Android wares in the first six or so.
[00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:36.160]   That's nothing.
[00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:37.160]   That's peanuts.
[00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:40.000]   And if they can do five million in one weekend, that's insane.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.200]   And they've already proven they have a market for this thing.
[00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:45.400]   But moving forward, we're not going to really know.
[00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:49.360]   They've already said they're going to lump these reports and with that other category
[00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:52.320]   with Apple TV and a bunch of other junk.
[00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:57.680]   So we'll get a sense from third parties and stuff how well this thing is doing.
[00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:01.120]   But it'll be really interesting to see if they have that press release tomorrow talking
[00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:04.240]   about opening weekend sales and pre-orders.
[00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:07.680]   It's a triumph of marketing though, isn't it, Steven?
[00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:12.960]   I think this, look how poorly everything else has done in this category.
[00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:14.320]   He needs one.
[00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:15.600]   It's a luxury item.
[00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:20.480]   And yet the triumph of Apple's marketing is it doesn't matter.
[00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:22.040]   They're going to sell out no matter what.
[00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:26.160]   Yeah, if you look feature for feature, what this watch can do versus Android Wear, I mean,
[00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:27.440]   the features are very similar.
[00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:31.840]   You can talk into it, you get notifications, it buzzes you, it looks a lot better than the
[00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:33.720]   Android watches.
[00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:35.680]   And it has that status symbol.
[00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:36.680]   It's more expensive.
[00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:38.400]   You know, it feels premium.
[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:42.680]   But as far as feature for feature, what it can do, there's not that use case.
[00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:47.080]   Like Android Wear hasn't proven the use case and it's too early to judge.
[00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:48.880]   But this hasn't proven it either.
[00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:52.840]   Maybe once, because it's Apple and it's a triumph of marketing, like you said, people
[00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:55.160]   will find that use case.
[00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:58.760]   But right now, even Apple's a big kind of mushy on that messaging.
[00:21:58.760 --> 00:21:59.760]   Why do you need this thing?
[00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:03.640]   There's that big thing in Wired that I know Ben wasn't a big fan of that piece.
[00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:07.680]   But that said, okay, it helps you not look at your phone so much.
[00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:09.400]   And that kind of came from Apple.
[00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:12.720]   It's still not clear if that's Apple's real mission with this thing.
[00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:16.880]   Or is it just that, you know, a status symbol, like you said, marketing?
[00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:17.880]   Yeah.
[00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:20.120]   Wait, so let me understand this.
[00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:22.480]   So on one hand, it's Apple's marketing.
[00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:26.320]   On the other hand, Apple is bad at articulating what it's good for.
[00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:29.120]   No, I'm not saying that's bad at articulating what it's good for.
[00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:33.200]   No, this is the tiredest trope when it comes to Apple ever, that Apple sells stuff because
[00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:35.720]   of good marketing when it matches feature for feature.
[00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:41.560]   I mean, it's like saying, why can you sell a MacBook that's more expensive, like the
[00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:43.000]   one I'm sitting in front of Jason?
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   What is it?
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.600]   $1,300 computer that's underpowered and low featured and only has one port.
[00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:53.680]   Like at some point, like when do we put this argument to bad that Apple sells stuff because
[00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:58.360]   of marketing and actually consider that maybe there's other factors going on?
[00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:00.160]   I mean, for the MacBook.
[00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:02.040]   Okay, maybe not marketing might not be the right word.
[00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:06.480]   Let's say, wow, factor than the Apple Allure marketing.
[00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:07.480]   Fine.
[00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:09.280]   Let's put that aside.
[00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:12.440]   The Allure, is that a fair statement then?
[00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:20.680]   I think I mean, Apple has built up a very loyal customer base.
[00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:21.680]   No question.
[00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:24.000]   I don't think anyone would deny that.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:30.840]   And the reason why they built that up, I would argue is they've delivered a superior user
[00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:33.280]   experience for their products relative to the competition.
[00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:36.280]   The problem with you, the user experience is it's something that doesn't go on a feature
[00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:37.280]   sheet.
[00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:39.840]   It's not something you can check off and compare next to each other.
[00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:42.440]   I mean, you started out when I jumped on your top with the Samsung Edge.
[00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:46.400]   I mean, why is Samsung losing the high end to Apple?
[00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:48.960]   It's not because of features.
[00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:53.920]   And given that Apple has got has people trust Apple.
[00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:57.920]   Like they trust that if they buy an Apple Pro, they're going to be satisfied with it.
[00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:01.320]   And now Apple can trade in on that trust.
[00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:12.120]   People will buy the watch regardless of what, because one, one, it will come in a new reputation.
[00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:15.640]   It's like saying that there's a, you know, people are going to go see a Disney movie.
[00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:19.160]   It's like that's not first off, that's earned Disney earns that label.
[00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:24.200]   And second, if they spend too much time not delivering what the promises, then people will
[00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:25.200]   stop going.
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:28.040]   There is that truth that you can have a brand that has that attachment to it.
[00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:32.080]   And I think that's what we see with Apple is, is part of this is yes.
[00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:36.080]   People are buying it because it's an Apple product, but Apple has earned a lot of that
[00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:39.640]   brand loyalty because of the products that they released up to now.
[00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:41.200]   They're buying it on faith.
[00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:42.680]   I think there is a certain degree.
[00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:46.320]   You know, I hate the faith based metaphors for Apple, but I think in this case you got
[00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:49.160]   it right, which is a product in a new category.
[00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:52.720]   You are, there is trust that I think a lot of people are putting an Apple that this will
[00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:56.160]   be a great product, even though they may not know quite what they're going to do with
[00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:59.960]   it because it's from Apple and they have some trust there.
[00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:06.160]   And that trust could easily be harmed if it doesn't live up to the hype.
[00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:07.160]   That's true.
[00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:13.320]   Apple probably also gets a pass from journalists who are unwilling to say be too strongly
[00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:17.640]   critical of it because you don't want to look like an idiot when the thing sells so
[00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:19.120]   well.
[00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:20.520]   That's not getting a past though.
[00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:22.240]   That's being totally rational.
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:27.880]   I mean, the reality is that I mean, I think I was on before the iPhone Leo.
[00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:31.320]   I think you were being super skeptical of the sales or was one of your best ones.
[00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:32.840]   I mean, the idiot who keeps saying that.
[00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:33.840]   Yeah.
[00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:34.840]   Right.
[00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:39.160]   I mean, and like, and fortunately, most of the time, you have like people like me coming
[00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:40.400]   out reminding you of it.
[00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:41.400]   Yeah.
[00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:46.000]   No, I don't mind because I don't, I honestly don't think that the iPhone is a better device
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:51.960]   than, for instance, the Galaxy S6 Edge knocks the iPhone all over the place.
[00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:57.080]   I mean, so many ways, but that doesn't have to anything to do with why people buy the
[00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:59.200]   iPhone apparently.
[00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:00.240]   And the same thing with a watch.
[00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:01.240]   It has nothing.
[00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:05.480]   It's like what you value in a phone is different than what what no, I think a lot of consumers
[00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:06.480]   value.
[00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:12.560]   I think anybody with an objective mind would say Android is a far superior choice.
[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:15.080]   I'm not even getting into this right now.
[00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:16.080]   That's good objectivity.
[00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:18.360]   I like to see your dictionary later later.
[00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:19.360]   That's objective.
[00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:22.960]   Look at the two and you didn't, if you came from Mars and you didn't know any of the history
[00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:26.040]   and you looked at it, you say, well, I don't understand why people are buying iPhones.
[00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:27.720]   Why would you buy an iPhone?
[00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:29.200]   That thing is constipated as hell.
[00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:33.400]   It's not it's a great, you got to grid icons.
[00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:35.120]   It's terrible.
[00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:42.720]   I don't, I don't like the problem with this perspective, Leo, is the implication of that
[00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:46.240]   is that there's a lot of people who are dumb in the world.
[00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:49.320]   And I'm not saying no, you are though.
[00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:51.480]   Because you're saying, obviously this is better.
[00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:56.240]   Why do these tens of millions, hundreds of millions of idiots keep buying and then for
[00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:58.040]   your product, that costs more?
[00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:02.200]   Well, that's, I'm not saying that because that's pretty, that's an insulting thing to
[00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:03.200]   say.
[00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:07.840]   Well, yeah, you're not saying people are not stupid.
[00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:10.640]   They're for whatever reason they're buying into.
[00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:15.000]   Look at people bought windows for years, even though it was a horrible operating system,
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   but that's what you bought.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   That's what everybody bought.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.480]   You buy a PC, you're going to buy windows.
[00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:20.080]   You buy a phone, you're going to buy an iPhone.
[00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:21.080]   It's just the default.
[00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:22.680]   It's not that they're dumb.
[00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:26.080]   It's they don't have time to figure out which is better than go with the default.
[00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:29.880]   No offense to Jason, but you were dumb to buy a Mac in the 90s.
[00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:32.520]   Maybe in the night there was a bad, no, I agree.
[00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:33.520]   OS nine and so forth.
[00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:34.520]   Those were dark times.
[00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:35.520]   Even the odds.
[00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:39.560]   I mean, like the reality is, is until the internet came along and most of our applications
[00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:45.960]   moved to the internet, you, there was just lots of stuff you literally could not do on,
[00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:50.920]   on a Mac and eat user experience aside.
[00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:57.840]   That was changed with the internet, which made it, which removed that kind of like gate.
[00:27:57.840 --> 00:27:59.880]   There's two different things when it comes to features.
[00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:04.120]   Some stuff is like it's a reason to buy and then there's stuff that's a reason not to
[00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:05.120]   buy.
[00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:07.960]   The reason not to buy, if you have it there, it's devastating.
[00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:13.960]   Windows phone, for example, not having a competitive set of apps and even if you have the apps
[00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:15.520]   you do have, they're all inferior.
[00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:16.520]   That's a reason to not buy.
[00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:21.320]   It doesn't matter how good user experience is, how, how do I feel it is to use or even
[00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:23.000]   if you use all Microsoft services.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.040]   You're not going to even consider it because there's a gate there.
[00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:30.680]   And that was the same thing when it came to, when it came to the Mac and to say that people
[00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:33.760]   were buying Windows because they were sheep.
[00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:35.560]   I think that's insulting to people.
[00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:37.640]   The reality is is people, most people aren't tech people.
[00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:40.080]   They're not sitting around weighing the stuff.
[00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:46.280]   They have stuff they want to get done and people, and in my experience anecdotally, but normal
[00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:50.800]   people who aren't trying to call it all consistently find it's easier to go about their day and
[00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:55.760]   it's less frustrating and they can do what they want to do more easily and consistently
[00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:56.760]   on an iPhone.
[00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:59.360]   And I agree with you in the 90s.
[00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:04.000]   That isn't true though after say 2005, 2004.
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.200]   But there's a lot of momentum and people continue to buy Windows and it's still a 95%
[00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:10.920]   operating system.
[00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:11.920]   So that's my point.
[00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:12.920]   No, you're right in the 90s.
[00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:13.920]   There was no question.
[00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:15.920]   I'm not talking about the 90s.
[00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:16.920]   Fair enough.
[00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:20.840]   But, well, I mean, you're the one that brought up the analogy.
[00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:23.080]   Well, but I, but you're the one who said it's the 90s.
[00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:28.160]   I'm saying, let's say 2000, let's say 10 years ago, 2005 that Windows sold out of a
[00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:29.560]   momentum more than anything else.
[00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:34.560]   Windows Vista or Windows XP sold out of a momentum compared to a Mac more than anything
[00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:35.560]   else.
[00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:37.280]   Well, I mean, 50% of the market.
[00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:39.280]   I feel like I'm being rough nearly a little.
[00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:41.880]   No, no, no, no, no, that's fine.
[00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:45.240]   It is the enterprise market, which again, there remains very good reasons to buy one
[00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:46.680]   I agree and enterprise.
[00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:47.680]   Absolutely.
[00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:48.680]   I agree 100%.
[00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:49.680]   I'm talking.
[00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:50.680]   I'm not talking about enterprise.
[00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:52.960]   I'm playing in the consumer market in the US.
[00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:58.480]   Apple is up to I don't know the exact numbers, but it's it's it's not far from 50%
[00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:02.000]   getting there like they are crushing the momentum.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.720]   Momentum doesn't last forever space.
[00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:05.360]   We live in a world with friction.
[00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:07.440]   We're not in space.
[00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:12.080]   The problem with analogy is the momentum is in favor of the iPhone.
[00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:14.000]   So I've got more people getting dumb over time.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.200]   Does that mean it's better?
[00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:17.840]   Is that is that does that?
[00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:20.320]   Well, I think it's a silly argument.
[00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:23.120]   You like what you like, but I don't I think just because something sells well doesn't
[00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:24.120]   make it better.
[00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:25.120]   No, I think that's true.
[00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:28.680]   But I you know, again, I think objectively you could see that there are for different
[00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:32.720]   people, different operating systems and platforms could be a value to them.
[00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:37.080]   And I don't think an alien that came down from outer space would necessarily look at
[00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:40.520]   the at the Android ecosystem and say that is clearly better.
[00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:44.560]   I think that it would depend on what the that aliens personal preferences were and how
[00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:46.080]   they wanted to use their phone.
[00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:49.880]   And because I look at the Android also, we got to say the difference between a platform
[00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:52.600]   and a product where the iPhone has used the Galaxy S6.
[00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:58.400]   Well, I think I think you could argue that the Galaxy S6 is one of the few and in fact,
[00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:02.680]   as Ben mentioned, Samsung changing its approach and pulling lots of features out of the
[00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:09.360]   Galaxy in order to create a product that by all accounts is way closer to what Apple
[00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:13.200]   has been doing with hardware and that and that people really like it.
[00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:14.960]   But a lot of these products aren't there.
[00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:18.120]   A lot of the Android experiences aren't that good.
[00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:20.800]   And so, you know, it's not just the operating system platform.
[00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:24.680]   It's also the hardware and Apple has excelled at that for quite a while now.
[00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:29.640]   And only now are we seeing some Android phones that that can match it.
[00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:34.920]   Katy Perry wearing her Mickey Mouse watch for well wearing his Mickey Mouse watch on
[00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:35.920]   the voice.
[00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:38.200]   I think there's something interesting going on here.
[00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:41.600]   I think this has to do with beats more than it does with the watch.
[00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:46.840]   I wonder if they're going to these artists in the face of an assault by title and their
[00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:51.800]   and titles own artists, Jay Z's friends Madonna and Beyonce.
[00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:56.880]   And so Apple saying, well, we just hey, Katie, just remember us when a new album comes out
[00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:59.080]   for us just remember us when the new album comes out.
[00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:01.080]   Here's your $17,000 gold watch.
[00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:04.040]   Well, they've done celebrity seating forever.
[00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:10.160]   I mean, even at the Apple watch debut way back in September, I mean, got Gwen Stefani
[00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:11.160]   was there.
[00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:12.160]   Will I am was there?
[00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:13.160]   Will I am making his own?
[00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:14.160]   Yeah.
[00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:15.160]   Yeah.
[00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:17.240]   So I mean, they've always had this.
[00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:21.520]   There's always been this like celebrity like or a or a state or hire now.
[00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:22.520]   Oh, yeah.
[00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:23.520]   Stakes are higher.
[00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:27.440]   And you know, I mean, I don't know if we're getting into this later, but yeah, that the
[00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:31.400]   beats thing part one thing they might want to do to set themselves apart is have this
[00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:32.400]   exclusive deals.
[00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:38.120]   I don't know if a $17,000 watch will necessarily entice someone who has the cash word that
[00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:41.680]   Katie Perry and Drake have to start using Apple instead.
[00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:43.520]   But who knows?
[00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:48.720]   They say if you get all the Mickey Mouse watches in a row, they'll all be tapping their foot
[00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:51.160]   in in together.
[00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:54.360]   Can we try that?
[00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:55.360]   I would assume so.
[00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:56.600]   And it's I don't know.
[00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:57.600]   I think that's a hard thing to do.
[00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:59.480]   Are they going to get the foot tap exactly?
[00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:01.680]   Well, they're all the same time.
[00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:02.680]   Yeah.
[00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:03.680]   Yeah.
[00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:04.680]   That would be pretty cool.
[00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:07.480]   All right.
[00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:10.200]   Anything more to say about the watch?
[00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:14.520]   I went to the store on Friday for on the 5th Avenue flagship store.
[00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:17.640]   And I thought the retail experience is kind of interesting.
[00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:21.800]   I mean, usually, yeah, the Apple store employees will spend a lot of time with you as much
[00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:25.080]   time as you need, answer all your stupid questions.
[00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:27.000]   But this is very different.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.840]   There's like, it's very intimate.
[00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:30.480]   They're letting you try on the bands.
[00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:32.560]   They're putting it on you.
[00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:36.200]   There's like a little drawer locked underneath the table that they unlock with an iPhone.
[00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:41.200]   It was a very is much different than any other time we've been to the Apple store is a very
[00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:42.200]   unique experience.
[00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:45.640]   They're kind of building around this product, especially when you say, okay, I'll take one
[00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:47.880]   and then they walk you over to a web browser.
[00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:48.880]   Yeah.
[00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:49.880]   That is interesting.
[00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:50.880]   Good.
[00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:52.880]   It's the concierge service.
[00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:55.800]   The concierge takes you to the web page.
[00:33:55.800 --> 00:34:00.520]   And you can-- I went to the quarter of a store here in North of San Francisco.
[00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:03.480]   And it was funny because they have this whole new setup.
[00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:07.040]   Like you said, it's like-- I think it's a device stuck on the back of an iPod touch.
[00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:10.080]   So it's not like actually in the unit, but they've got this RFID thing.
[00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:11.920]   It's part of their sales package.
[00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:12.920]   Yeah.
[00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:15.440]   And they were-- it was the first morning and they were struggling with it and sort of
[00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:19.560]   like figuring it out how you get those drawers unlocked and all of that.
[00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:21.600]   Because there was a learning curve there.
[00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:22.600]   But it is fascinating.
[00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:26.680]   And it was actually-- it'll be interesting to see how that changes the feel of Apple
[00:34:26.680 --> 00:34:29.960]   stores because now they've got those big tables for the Apple watch right in the middle
[00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:30.960]   there.
[00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:32.920]   And are those going to be super busy with people?
[00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:34.720]   Are they going to be quieter than the other places?
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:35.720]   I don't really know.
[00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:39.120]   But it's going to change the retail experience at Apple stores a little bit.
[00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:45.640]   The Verge went shopping at Galleria Fayette at Isecon in Tokyo.
[00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:50.480]   These are the non-Apple retailers, but the fancy stores, Selfridges in London, where
[00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:54.120]   they are selling and they have special hush.
[00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:55.120]   Because luxury, Lea.
[00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:56.120]   Because luxury.
[00:34:56.120 --> 00:34:57.120]   Luxury.
[00:34:57.120 --> 00:35:01.760]   And of course, did any of you have the nerve to go in and say, "I want to look at the addition?"
[00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:02.760]   No way.
[00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:04.480]   I want to do that.
[00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:05.480]   Can I see the addition?
[00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:07.960]   They would look at my hoodie and say, "I don't think so."
[00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:08.960]   Oh, no, no, no.
[00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:09.960]   They're not good.
[00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:10.960]   Sorry, sir.
[00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:11.960]   You think they would do that?
[00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:12.960]   No, they wouldn't do it.
[00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:13.960]   They would play along.
[00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:14.960]   Yeah.
[00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:17.880]   They're asking for a credit report before you go see it, are they?
[00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:18.880]   Probably not.
[00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:20.880]   Besides, this is the Bay Area, billionaires wear hoodies here.
[00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:21.880]   Right.
[00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:25.680]   My startup, I just, an IPO just launched it.
[00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:31.560]   My CFO said I should get myself something pretty.
[00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:33.840]   Was it Tom Lorne who made a run for it?
[00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:36.560]   One of the Verge people made a run for it.
[00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:37.560]   He's good now.
[00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:41.120]   Yeah, the security guard simply smiled and watched me head to the door.
[00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:42.120]   Good job.
[00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:46.800]   I'm a thief, otherwise I'd be in the back of a London taxi typing up my eBay auction right
[00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:48.160]   now.
[00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:50.360]   Good for you, Tom Lorne.
[00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:52.320]   He ran for it.
[00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:53.960]   You saw Christina.
[00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:54.960]   Was it, no, no.
[00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:58.840]   Joanna Stern's review for the Wall Street Journal, she actually just did a funny thing.
[00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:03.280]   She got a camera attached to her head temporarily.
[00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:05.400]   I mean, it's not a permanent thing.
[00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:06.400]   No.
[00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:08.840]   And was shooting her whole day.
[00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:09.840]   Like she wakes up.
[00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:10.840]   Oh, she has to turn it off.
[00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:12.360]   She gets in the shower with it.
[00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:14.000]   She says, don't try this at home.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.440]   Then she's walking through the Wall Street Journal offices.
[00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:20.840]   Rupert Murdoch walks up to her and says, what's that?
[00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:22.960]   She said, I was the new Apple Watch, Mr. Murdoch.
[00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:25.240]   He says, can I say it?
[00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:27.240]   And he walks off with it.
[00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:29.320]   It was good.
[00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:31.160]   It was funny.
[00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:32.640]   It's a good bit.
[00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:36.280]   It's been translated into Chinese as it's been very popular over here as well.
[00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:38.160]   Oh, really interesting.
[00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:42.880]   I think this is the best review actually of the watch was the Wall Street Journal.
[00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:43.880]   Joanna.
[00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:44.880]   Joanna's really excellent video.
[00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:46.440]   She's so good, yeah.
[00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:48.880]   Well, we were talking before the show.
[00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:53.160]   Steve Kovecke and I were talking about the must have been tens of thousands of dollars
[00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:57.400]   that the Verge put into the production of "Nee-Lite Patel's Review," where there's actually
[00:36:57.400 --> 00:37:00.920]   at the end credits, there's two stylists, six videographers.
[00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:03.880]   I wanted music to play over the end credits, in fact.
[00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:05.520]   It's unbelievable.
[00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:10.960]   And Steve and I had the same experience, which is we flipped through it like a glossy magazine,
[00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:12.760]   but didn't read any of the copy.
[00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:15.560]   We looked at the video and the experience.
[00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:20.240]   I've never seen anything quite like that in a blog.
[00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:24.080]   I'm feeling a lot of people did what you and I did, Leo, and just kind of scroll through
[00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:25.080]   it.
[00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:26.080]   Yeah.
[00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:29.040]   It was way too dense for me to read.
[00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:31.880]   I tried it on the phone, also too dense.
[00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:33.640]   I still have no idea what that review says in this video.
[00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:34.640]   It's a good review.
[00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:36.640]   I had to read it on an instant paper, but it's a good review.
[00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:37.640]   It's not sad.
[00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:41.440]   They've been so much money on the production and they've got it.
[00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:44.720]   It's very impressive, but to read the article, I ended up reading it on an instant paper.
[00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:47.800]   Yeah, Steve tried to do the same thing.
[00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:49.800]   He didn't render that well on an instant paper.
[00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:51.560]   It's not great, but it works.
[00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:56.800]   Neil and I did the same thing, Joe and I did, which is through this video, showed the battery
[00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:58.040]   life.
[00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:02.360]   And one thing that's pretty clear is the battery does die fairly early on.
[00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:03.360]   She at 10 p.m.
[00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:04.360]   She started at 7 a.m.
[00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:07.640]   10 p.m. was getting had to go in low-power mode.
[00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:08.640]   But it's not bad.
[00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:09.640]   7 a.m.
[00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:10.640]   to 10 p.m.
[00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:11.640]   It's not early on.
[00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:14.920]   And she's using it the whole time.
[00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:19.120]   I thought actually the consensus was that the battery is a lot better than we wouldn't
[00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:20.120]   expect.
[00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:21.120]   It was sufficient.
[00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:26.280]   It seems to me that Apple may have been so worried about all day battery life that they
[00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:29.480]   have cranked back on a lot of other things in order to make sure it gets through the
[00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:31.440]   day, which I think is the right decision.
[00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:35.800]   But it does lead to some places where people say, "Well, it didn't wake up and show me
[00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:39.160]   the time fast enough and it didn't sync with the phone fast enough."
[00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:41.920]   And I think those are all decisions that Apple had to make in order to get it through
[00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:42.920]   the day.
[00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:46.760]   But if you can't get it through the day, there's no point in having that product.
[00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:49.320]   So they had to get it to survive a day.
[00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:56.320]   There was a commonality in both Joanna and Neil and I complained about the creepy emoticons,
[00:38:56.320 --> 00:38:58.960]   the 3D emoticons.
[00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:03.200]   She had trouble with the UI because it's so tiny.
[00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:07.520]   She said you have to have doll-like fingers to use the buttons.
[00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:10.720]   I think she didn't know you could pinch it and zoom it and make it bigger.
[00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:11.720]   You can pinch.
[00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:14.080]   You can twirl the crown to make it bigger.
[00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:15.080]   It's not multi-touch.
[00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:16.080]   Yeah.
[00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:18.880]   A lot of people say, in fact, there was a real commonality, I think, in the reviews.
[00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:21.080]   A number of people said that there's a learning curve.
[00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:24.760]   Some people said it's really a discoverability curve, but nonetheless, time spent with the
[00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:30.480]   watch will benefit you because in a few days or weeks you'll get a little bit better with
[00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:31.480]   it.
[00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:36.800]   It's good that all of these reviewers had some time with it because I feel like the
[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:40.560]   best review of this thing is going to be after somebody spends more than a month with
[00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:43.320]   it to really know what it's like and does it really--
[00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:44.320]   Here comes Rupert Murdoch.
[00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:45.320]   Can you really integrate it?
[00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:48.760]   Oh, man, that old man is going to steal your watch.
[00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:51.480]   You think they called Rupert and said, "Look, we're doing this thing.
[00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:54.560]   Could you come down to the fourth floor from your eerie--"
[00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:56.920]   Can you hear the audio?
[00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:57.920]   Sure.
[00:39:57.920 --> 00:39:59.200]   Yeah, that's OK.
[00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:00.200]   That's really nice.
[00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:01.200]   Yeah, it is.
[00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:02.200]   Thank you very much.
[00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:03.200]   Thank you.
[00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:09.560]   Oh, actually, I need that back.
[00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:15.600]   At the end of the review, they show the headgear that she shot the whole thing herself compared
[00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:17.960]   to Nila, who had 18 cameramen.
[00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:24.200]   She's wearing some sort of strange bicycle helmet with a camera in front of it.
[00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:26.160]   And an umbrella.
[00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:28.320]   Yeah, she was talking about it on Twitter.
[00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:32.680]   I think-- I was like, "Why don't you just go Google Ashlight," but that's not the quality
[00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:34.000]   resolution isn't high enough.
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:35.960]   Yeah, that's a DSLR.
[00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:39.000]   That is a lot of guts to get on the subway wearing that.
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   Oh, it's great.
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:41.800]   She's either a great person.
[00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:45.760]   I mean, Joyster has been killing it with her, especially with their video reviews.
[00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:50.560]   They're consistently both informative and really funny.
[00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:53.280]   But no, she's doing a great job.
[00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:55.920]   This is a definite high point.
[00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:56.920]   She's a star.
[00:40:56.920 --> 00:40:59.040]   There's a reason she was working for ABC News for a while, right?
[00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:01.120]   I mean, she's got the-- her video chops.
[00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:02.120]   Her video chops.
[00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:03.120]   Her video chops.
[00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:04.120]   Yeah, great, too.
[00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:05.120]   Yep.
[00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:08.720]   By the way, she also writes the-- so Galaxy S60 iPhone 6 is when it's match.
[00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:09.720]   Yeah.
[00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:12.040]   The only thing wrong with this S6 is battery life.
[00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:14.400]   It's terrible.
[00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:17.440]   But it's got a fingerprint reader that's as good as the Apple.
[00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:19.920]   You don't have to swipe it.
[00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:23.920]   Samsung might regret the glass back at some point.
[00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:24.920]   It gets hot.
[00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:28.600]   I think-- and I think the glass back, you're asking for trouble.
[00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:29.840]   Fingerprints if nothing else.
[00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:31.560]   I mean, Apple tried that with the 4, right?
[00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:34.400]   And they went away from the glass back at the 6.
[00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:37.320]   Boy, the screen, though, 577 dots per inch.
[00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:40.600]   I mean, the retina brand has been stolen from Apple, I think.
[00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:42.400]   At some point, you can't see the dots anymore.
[00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:43.400]   It's my only thing.
[00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:44.880]   You can go that's out of the FBI.
[00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:48.600]   Unless you're Superman, I'm not sure you can see the dots beyond about--
[00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:52.400]   With a magnifying glass, you can't see the dots in this thing.
[00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:54.080]   Camera is stunning.
[00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:57.640]   I would say a strong rival for both the Lumia and the iPhone.
[00:41:57.640 --> 00:41:59.800]   I love that Samsung took features out of that product,
[00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:01.000]   because it's more focused product.
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   In fact, that's actually one of my concerns about the watch.
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:03.880]   The Apple watch is--
[00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:04.400]   Too much.
[00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:08.040]   There are so many features in it, instead of focusing on fewer,
[00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:09.800]   but more solid features.
[00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:10.840]   And we'll have to see.
[00:42:10.840 --> 00:42:12.720]   Well, yeah.
[00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:16.000]   I mean, that's a pretty sweet looking, well-designed phone.
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:17.080]   Took the plastic back off.
[00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:18.120]   I think that's really good.
[00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:20.320]   I don't, because I want a battery to put it in there.
[00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:20.800]   I can't.
[00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:21.840]   It's driving me crazy.
[00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:23.000]   So it's interesting.
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:27.800]   You mentioned that, Leo, because I'm not sure that--
[00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:31.200]   I'm very curious to see how the S6 sells.
[00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:36.920]   Because one reason to think that why objectively Android
[00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:41.880]   is superior in your words is there's no question the OS
[00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:44.640]   is much more flexible, much more customizable.
[00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:47.840]   You can arrange things more to your liking.
[00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:51.200]   But I think if you're dealing in a premium product,
[00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:55.440]   or someone's paying several hundred dollars for a phone,
[00:42:55.440 --> 00:42:58.480]   and they are buying it because they value
[00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:00.680]   that customization and flexibility,
[00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:04.240]   I would assume they probably value it in the hardware as well.
[00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:06.640]   And I think this is actually an advantage that Samsung actually
[00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:08.320]   always had over HTC, for example.
[00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:11.040]   HTC's been making beautiful phones for a while,
[00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:13.800]   and it hasn't exactly helped them that much.
[00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:16.440]   And I think that someone who values that in their operating
[00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:19.240]   system is more likely to value that--
[00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:21.520]   sorry about that-- value that in the hardware
[00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:22.840]   to be able to switch batteries, to be
[00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:25.000]   able to have the expandable storage, things like that.
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:26.760]   And it's interesting to hear you say that you're
[00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:32.440]   disappointed that they prioritize the quality
[00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:36.960]   or the industrial design or the aesthetic, I should say,
[00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:38.480]   over the rest of it.
[00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:40.440]   Because I suspect there's a lot of people
[00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:41.600]   that are going to think that way.
[00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:44.280]   So it'll be interesting to see how it sells.
[00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:47.320]   It's a pretty spectacular shift for Samsung, which
[00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:51.680]   was making utilitarian industrial design
[00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:55.000]   phones like the Note 4, which I was carrying prior to this.
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:56.600]   I'm not a Samsung fan, by the way.
[00:43:56.600 --> 00:43:58.880]   I thought the S5 was awful.
[00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:00.880]   I've been very disappointed by the junk where Samsung's
[00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:03.000]   been lading into its Android.
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:06.520]   And yet this phone is easily the most beautiful phone
[00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:07.360]   I've ever held.
[00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:08.280]   This is the edge.
[00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:11.920]   So it's got the infinity screen.
[00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:13.760]   I wish I had the infinity battery life,
[00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:15.640]   but unfortunately not.
[00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:18.200]   See, they're following Apple in so many different areas.
[00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:18.720]   Isn't that funny?
[00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:20.360]   Even people complaining about the battery.
[00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:21.360]   Yeah.
[00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:22.520]   Yeah.
[00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:25.960]   What's the size of the VS6 again?
[00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:27.000]   It is more like--
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:28.520]   It's very close to an iPhone 6.
[00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:30.040]   Yeah, it's very close to an iPhone 6.
[00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:32.760]   25 is 50 by 1,400.
[00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:35.880]   So if you have an iPhone 6, and put it next to it,
[00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:39.920]   the width, the heights is a little taller.
[00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:41.560]   But the thickness is the same.
[00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:43.680]   It's about 7 millimeters.
[00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:47.400]   Weight-wise, it's about the same.
[00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:49.400]   It just doesn't run that constipated iOS.
[00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:52.160]   Yeah.
[00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:52.880]   People don't--
[00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:54.520]   Why don't they invite you to things?
[00:44:54.520 --> 00:44:55.520]   I can't understand.
[00:44:55.520 --> 00:44:56.440]   Why does that not happen?
[00:44:56.440 --> 00:44:57.160]   I don't understand.
[00:44:57.160 --> 00:44:59.360]   Did you read Cuchal Dave's medium pieces?
[00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:00.200]   This is very interesting.
[00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:01.480]   He said, I did not write this piece
[00:45:01.480 --> 00:45:03.000]   until I was no longer working for a company.
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:06.280]   Because I know Apple app developers
[00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:07.760]   do not want to speak out about this,
[00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:10.120]   because they're afraid of getting slapped down by Apple.
[00:45:10.120 --> 00:45:13.120]   He says-- and I completely agree with him--
[00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:14.920]   that the review process in the app store
[00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:18.560]   is hurting users partly because bug fixes are way delayed
[00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:23.000]   by weeks, partly because Apple has decided to be a nanny
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:29.200]   and prohibit all sorts of apps that we should be able to see.
[00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:31.200]   We're not four-year-olds.
[00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:33.320]   And I'm not just talking about adult content,
[00:45:33.320 --> 00:45:37.400]   but political content, all kinds of content.
[00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:40.440]   Apple is blocking apps that ridicule public figures
[00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:43.960]   that show too much skin, apps with jobs, themes, legal marijuana
[00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:47.880]   information, gun images, search engines, drones.
[00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:50.760]   Steve Jobs once argued he was actually offering us freedom,
[00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:52.840]   freedom from porn.
[00:45:52.840 --> 00:45:56.760]   Apple says, if you want to criticize a religion, write a book.
[00:45:56.760 --> 00:45:59.520]   I think Apple's putting itself in a very interesting position
[00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:00.080]   here.
[00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:03.080]   Obviously, again, people don't care.
[00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:04.920]   So they sold 75 million phones.
[00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:05.360]   Whoops.
[00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:07.000]   I don't know where that's what I'm getting there.
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:08.600]   There we go.
[00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:12.520]   But this is a strong-- I think a strong indictment of Apple
[00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:15.880]   as a gatekeeper, as a bad, frankly,
[00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:18.480]   steward of the app store, because it's
[00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:23.240]   so hard to get bug fixes out, so hard to test apps.
[00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:27.800]   Anyway.
[00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:29.400]   I'm not here to bash Apple, actually.
[00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:30.760]   I wasn't intending to do that.
[00:46:30.760 --> 00:46:33.040]   I think there's a bunch of things in this piece.
[00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:34.360]   A lot of this is not new at all.
[00:46:34.360 --> 00:46:38.160]   This is a lot of this is fundamentally just complaining
[00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:41.000]   about app store moderation policies that a lot of them
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:44.800]   have been in place since Steve Jobs was making those rules.
[00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:46.600]   I do think there's some interesting things in there
[00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:50.040]   about how the backlog, in the present day,
[00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:54.240]   the backlog creates issues where it's hard to get bug fixes out.
[00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:55.480]   I've heard from developers who said
[00:46:55.480 --> 00:46:58.160]   that they have some updates that are just a few nice to have
[00:46:58.160 --> 00:46:59.760]   features, but not major features.
[00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:01.440]   And they don't bother to release them,
[00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:03.640]   because they don't want to go through the process.
[00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:06.200]   And I think if you're going to be Apple and say,
[00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:08.320]   we're going to watch everything that gets submitted,
[00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:09.800]   there's some responsibility you have
[00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:11.240]   to take to get the backlog down.
[00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:14.160]   You've got to find a way to make it so that your developers
[00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:16.440]   aren't spending weeks waiting for their apps to get out.
[00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:19.080]   But also, arbitrary enforcement of the rules
[00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:21.480]   is never clear whether your app's going to get approved or not.
[00:47:21.480 --> 00:47:23.240]   We learn this so a good friend of mine
[00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:26.080]   is a developer of an app that got approved
[00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:28.040]   and then told to be removed.
[00:47:28.040 --> 00:47:30.360]   It was plotted and featured on the store.
[00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:32.960]   And then some other part of Apple said, no, no, no.
[00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:34.560]   We don't want you to do that.
[00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:36.840]   And that happens sometimes.
[00:47:36.840 --> 00:47:39.160]   And I think that a bunch of things are going on here.
[00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:44.120]   I think Steve Jobs was a real key figure
[00:47:44.120 --> 00:47:45.840]   in defining what the rules were.
[00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:49.000]   And with him gone, Apple is willing to change,
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:50.880]   but there are parts of Apple that are changing
[00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:53.520]   and other parts that are not changing as quickly, if at all.
[00:47:53.520 --> 00:47:55.760]   And so there are, I think, inside Apple, there's conflict.
[00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:58.640]   And when Apple is a black box like it is, it's very hard.
[00:47:58.640 --> 00:48:02.040]   You end up with these bizarre behaviors of like, they say yes.
[00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:03.200]   And they say, we'll feature you.
[00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:04.960]   And then they say, please take it out of the store,
[00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:06.640]   which doesn't make any sense.
[00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:08.680]   It is absolutely problematic.
[00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:12.040]   I think the idea that comes from Steve Jobs of,
[00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:13.920]   we need to make the app store someplace
[00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:17.760]   that if it's not really appropriate for the lowest
[00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:20.640]   common denominator of essentially a child,
[00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:22.400]   we need to keep it out of the store,
[00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:24.920]   is also probably kind of crazy now.
[00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:28.000]   I'm optimistic that Apple is changing
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:30.560]   and that their approach is going to change here.
[00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:31.960]   But right now it's kind of a mess.
[00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:33.800]   And I think that's because there are parts of Apple
[00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:36.240]   that want to change and other parts that don't.
[00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:37.520]   - 10.10.3 came out.
[00:48:37.520 --> 00:48:38.600]   We're just finished the Apple stuff.
[00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:39.440]   We'll give it a call.
[00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:40.280]   - You want to go ahead.
[00:48:40.280 --> 00:48:41.360]   - 10.10.3.
[00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:42.200]   Go ahead.
[00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:43.040]   - One more thing.
[00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:44.040]   - One more thing on this point.
[00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:46.040]   And you said you didn't come out of bash Apple,
[00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:47.160]   I didn't come out into defend Apple.
[00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:50.880]   But I think first off I completely agree with both of you
[00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:54.280]   and with Jason's point that there are significant issues
[00:48:54.280 --> 00:48:55.240]   with the app store process.
[00:48:55.240 --> 00:48:58.480]   I think this is something I've been consistently
[00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:00.720]   very critical of Apple about.
[00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:05.520]   Not just from the randomness of it,
[00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:08.280]   but also the fact that I think they're hurting themselves
[00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:10.560]   by not enabling sustainable businesses.
[00:49:10.560 --> 00:49:12.680]   And I think Jason's point about there being,
[00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:14.960]   we look at Apple as being a monolith,
[00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:17.480]   but there's different factions within Apple.
[00:49:17.480 --> 00:49:20.120]   And there's parts of Apple that are still very much
[00:49:20.120 --> 00:49:23.240]   connected to the old Apple as it were.
[00:49:23.240 --> 00:49:26.440]   And one of those sections is app review
[00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:28.000]   if you look at where it sits in realization,
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:30.760]   that realization is still kind of the old Apple.
[00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:34.960]   That said, I thought this article was disappointing.
[00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:37.560]   It was disappointing primarily for the title.
[00:49:37.560 --> 00:49:39.680]   Apple's app store review process is hurting users.
[00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:43.240]   It is hurting users by extension sort of thing.
[00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:44.760]   It's hurting developers.
[00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:48.840]   And by developers being hurt and not releasing updates
[00:49:48.840 --> 00:49:51.280]   and things like that, users are certainly hurt.
[00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:53.760]   The issue though is nowhere in this article
[00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:57.120]   does it acknowledge the way that the app store
[00:49:57.120 --> 00:49:58.960]   and Apple's stringent control.
[00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:01.320]   And again, the trust that people have an Apple
[00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:04.080]   has fundamentally changed the way that users
[00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:06.160]   think about software and think about apps.
[00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:08.920]   To go back to Windows, people were scared.
[00:50:08.920 --> 00:50:10.640]   They were scared to download stuff.
[00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:12.040]   No one would do it.
[00:50:12.040 --> 00:50:15.400]   And the app store and this process
[00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:17.880]   completely changed the way people approached it,
[00:50:17.880 --> 00:50:21.760]   both helping users and helping developers frankly.
[00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:26.640]   And I think that there's an issue here where yes,
[00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:27.800]   absolutely believe there are things
[00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:30.040]   that Apple needs to change.
[00:50:30.040 --> 00:50:31.560]   Absolutely believe it could be better.
[00:50:31.560 --> 00:50:35.000]   I again, criticize them consistently on this point.
[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:37.120]   But I think without acknowledging
[00:50:37.120 --> 00:50:40.560]   the real benefits that are here
[00:50:40.560 --> 00:50:44.400]   and the benefit it has to normal people,
[00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:47.880]   it does this argument, this service.
[00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:51.120]   And I wish that would have included that kind of,
[00:50:51.120 --> 00:50:54.160]   it goes too far in saying that that user,
[00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:57.000]   I think on balance users benefit from app review.
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:59.400]   And without it, we acknowledging that balance,
[00:50:59.400 --> 00:51:02.600]   I think it makes the argument weaker than there ought to be.
[00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:05.040]   'Cause there's absolutely a lot of good points in there.
[00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:06.200]   Apple certainly does a better job
[00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:07.760]   than Apple's in Microsoft,
[00:51:07.760 --> 00:51:09.400]   but I'm not sure that it does a better job
[00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:11.520]   than Android at this point.
[00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:15.320]   They're doing some very limited review,
[00:51:15.320 --> 00:51:19.000]   but it seems to not be at the scale that Apple is.
[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:21.440]   And I don't note that there are particularly bad,
[00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:24.200]   I mean, there are bad apps on all the app stores.
[00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:26.600]   There are dopey apps in all the app stores.
[00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:29.840]   There is, I mean, Apple does provide
[00:51:29.840 --> 00:51:32.520]   a traditional layer of scrutiny here.
[00:51:32.520 --> 00:51:35.440]   There's malware in all the app stores I might add.
[00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:38.120]   Very hard, there's a lot less of it on the Apple store
[00:51:38.120 --> 00:51:41.080]   because they do scan and have people checking,
[00:51:41.080 --> 00:51:42.840]   you know, it can get through
[00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:44.080]   and then they run the kill switch on it.
[00:51:44.080 --> 00:51:46.080]   But I think there's a lot less of it.
[00:51:46.080 --> 00:51:48.200]   - What, and beyond that,
[00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:50.240]   I think the way that the apps are
[00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:53.080]   are sandboxed much more aggressively on iOS,
[00:51:53.080 --> 00:51:55.120]   perhaps leading to your constipation Leo.
[00:51:55.120 --> 00:51:59.480]   Like you can't really hurt your phone
[00:51:59.480 --> 00:52:00.760]   by downloading the app store.
[00:52:00.760 --> 00:52:03.280]   And I'm not sure you can say the same thing about Android.
[00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:05.560]   At least previously, I know they've instituted a new level
[00:52:05.560 --> 00:52:08.120]   of control in the last couple of months.
[00:52:08.120 --> 00:52:10.640]   But that, like, I think, again,
[00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:13.880]   it's kind of this mushy, hand-wavy sort of stuff,
[00:52:13.880 --> 00:52:17.360]   but that, like, that's how Apple gets trust.
[00:52:17.360 --> 00:52:19.960]   Like people feel safe using an iPhone.
[00:52:19.960 --> 00:52:22.000]   They feel like everything's gonna be okay.
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:23.520]   They can just download stuff and delete it
[00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:26.560]   and it doesn't, and it's gonna still work okay.
[00:52:26.560 --> 00:52:29.600]   And that accumulated over time
[00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:31.240]   is why Apple keeps a profit margin.
[00:52:31.240 --> 00:52:33.640]   It's why they sell the watch on the first weekend.
[00:52:33.640 --> 00:52:34.800]   And I think it matters.
[00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:37.440]   It's not marketing, it's not people being brainwashed.
[00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:40.680]   It's that, like, people don't wanna be techies.
[00:52:40.680 --> 00:52:41.920]   They just wanna live their life
[00:52:41.920 --> 00:52:43.800]   and have something that helps them do it better.
[00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:46.400]   And Apple's in the trust that they're gonna help them
[00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:47.960]   do it better than other brands will.
[00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:50.440]   And the reason I argue about this is not, again,
[00:52:50.440 --> 00:52:52.200]   I don't own any Apple stock.
[00:52:52.200 --> 00:52:53.480]   I don't wanna be a defender.
[00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:57.200]   But I think that a core thing that I think business analysis
[00:52:57.200 --> 00:52:59.920]   is a strategy why they get Apple wrong a lot
[00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:03.040]   is they don't value this sort of middle, this gray area,
[00:53:03.040 --> 00:53:08.040]   this consumer psychology aspect, user experience aspect.
[00:53:08.040 --> 00:53:09.480]   I think Apple excels that.
[00:53:09.480 --> 00:53:12.400]   And I think that makes it hard to understand
[00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:13.760]   why the company does so well.
[00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:16.320]   And it's why people get the predictions wrong all the time.
[00:53:16.320 --> 00:53:17.680]   - Yeah, I didn't think that's funny.
[00:53:17.680 --> 00:53:18.600]   I just find it so well.
[00:53:18.600 --> 00:53:22.400]   - Intellectually fascinating.
[00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:24.720]   And that's why I, that's why I get it.
[00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:26.200]   - But is that any different than saying,
[00:53:26.200 --> 00:53:29.160]   making a great brand like a Burberry raincoat,
[00:53:29.160 --> 00:53:32.120]   which isn't demonstrably better than some other brand raincoat,
[00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:35.000]   but outsells it because the brand is better.
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:35.840]   Isn't it like that?
[00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:38.560]   I mean, isn't it just saying, well, there's not,
[00:53:38.560 --> 00:53:41.240]   I come from a background of celebrating technical excellence,
[00:53:41.240 --> 00:53:43.040]   not marketing excellence.
[00:53:43.040 --> 00:53:45.720]   And I think Apple has clearly got marketing excellence
[00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:46.760]   behind it 100%.
[00:53:46.760 --> 00:53:50.680]   But I'm not convinced that that reflects a technical excellence
[00:53:50.680 --> 00:53:52.680]   to be honest at this point anymore.
[00:53:52.680 --> 00:53:55.120]   - Well, I mean, let's talk about 10.10.3
[00:53:55.120 --> 00:53:58.320]   because I think this is a little frustrating.
[00:53:58.320 --> 00:54:03.320]   There is a backdoor vulnerability that 10.10.3
[00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:05.600]   is vulnerable to Apple has patched it,
[00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:08.640]   or 10 that all iOS, actually all OS 10 is vulnerable to.
[00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:12.920]   Apple has patched it in 10.10.3, this root pipe.
[00:54:12.920 --> 00:54:15.440]   But they have decided that it's too hard to fix it
[00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:17.360]   in previous versions of OS 10,
[00:54:17.360 --> 00:54:19.520]   meaning that millions of Apple Macintosh users
[00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:21.120]   are vulnerable to it.
[00:54:21.120 --> 00:54:24.640]   It is an escalation backdoor.
[00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:27.360]   It's actually an API that was put in there by Apple
[00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:30.520]   and allows escalation to root privileges
[00:54:30.520 --> 00:54:32.080]   from any user account in the system.
[00:54:32.080 --> 00:54:34.280]   Maybe it's not a real threat, I don't know,
[00:54:34.280 --> 00:54:36.840]   but the fact that Apple's patching it only
[00:54:36.840 --> 00:54:39.600]   on the latest version of their operating system
[00:54:39.600 --> 00:54:41.600]   seems to me not great.
[00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:42.800]   Then there's the iCloud.
[00:54:42.800 --> 00:54:44.920]   - You gotta keep in mind that Apple's actually spent
[00:54:44.920 --> 00:54:48.520]   the last couple of versions of OS 10
[00:54:48.520 --> 00:54:52.120]   not pushing the compatibility forward.
[00:54:52.120 --> 00:54:54.680]   So there's a huge number of existing Macs.
[00:54:54.680 --> 00:54:58.640]   Almost every Mac made since 2009,
[00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:00.720]   and a lot of them from 2008, and in fact,
[00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:03.040]   iMacs from 2007 can run the current version
[00:55:03.040 --> 00:55:04.040]   of the operating system.
[00:55:04.040 --> 00:55:06.800]   So yeah, they would have to update for free.
[00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:08.160]   - But there are other reasons.
[00:55:08.160 --> 00:55:10.120]   We had somebody in the audience today
[00:55:10.120 --> 00:55:12.560]   who runs some specialized sign making software
[00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:14.480]   that won't run on Yosemite.
[00:55:14.480 --> 00:55:18.640]   - Yeah, I get it, I'm just saying it is not as catastrophic
[00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:20.760]   as if this was an operating system
[00:55:20.760 --> 00:55:24.440]   that didn't run past two year old machines.
[00:55:24.440 --> 00:55:26.760]   And that you had to pay a lot of money to upgrade.
[00:55:26.760 --> 00:55:29.600]   But it's not quite as bad as that.
[00:55:29.600 --> 00:55:30.520]   - Right.
[00:55:30.520 --> 00:55:33.880]   - Yeah, I mean, I appreciate you raising this up, Leo,
[00:55:33.880 --> 00:55:35.640]   because now I can hopefully prove that
[00:55:35.640 --> 00:55:39.120]   I'm not all completely in the back for Apple.
[00:55:39.120 --> 00:55:41.560]   I think this is a very poor decision.
[00:55:41.560 --> 00:55:45.560]   And frankly, I think Apple's security record
[00:55:45.560 --> 00:55:48.240]   in particular with OS 10 is getting worse, not better.
[00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:50.400]   And it's never been particularly great.
[00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:53.640]   And I think it's a bit of a dangerous game.
[00:55:53.640 --> 00:55:55.320]   I can understand Jason's point.
[00:55:55.320 --> 00:55:57.640]   Like they're offering the updates for free.
[00:55:57.640 --> 00:55:58.920]   They go back a long ways.
[00:55:58.920 --> 00:56:00.800]   Like why aren't you up to date?
[00:56:00.800 --> 00:56:05.040]   There are reasons, particularly in some professional contexts
[00:56:05.040 --> 00:56:06.640]   where you're dealing with certain kinds
[00:56:06.640 --> 00:56:07.720]   of specialized software and stuff
[00:56:07.720 --> 00:56:09.600]   where you might not be up to date.
[00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:13.960]   And it just doesn't seem something that,
[00:56:13.960 --> 00:56:15.880]   yes, there's a bad, like what's the old thing?
[00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:19.280]   Like Apple prioritizes one Apple two users
[00:56:19.280 --> 00:56:21.520]   and like three developers in that order.
[00:56:22.400 --> 00:56:24.720]   This seems to be taking the prioritizing Apple
[00:56:24.720 --> 00:56:27.120]   and what makes life easier for them.
[00:56:27.120 --> 00:56:28.760]   A little too far, unfortunately,
[00:56:28.760 --> 00:56:33.400]   it's part of a pattern of Apple being slow with updates
[00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:36.920]   and not as far reaching as they probably should.
[00:56:36.920 --> 00:56:39.560]   And it's a dangerous game because it messes with that trust.
[00:56:39.560 --> 00:56:43.200]   Like if someone has an issue here
[00:56:43.200 --> 00:56:47.200]   and because Apple wasn't aggressive at updating it,
[00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:48.760]   like that's a problem.
[00:56:48.760 --> 00:56:53.760]   And I was disappointed and sadly not that surprised
[00:56:53.760 --> 00:56:55.600]   by this news.
[00:56:55.600 --> 00:56:58.360]   - And I should say my point is that it could have been worse
[00:56:58.360 --> 00:57:01.960]   because at least you can update many systems for free.
[00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:04.160]   But in Macworld, we had a system that was still running
[00:57:04.160 --> 00:57:06.120]   Snow Leopard because there was specific software
[00:57:06.120 --> 00:57:08.120]   that didn't even run on Lion,
[00:57:08.120 --> 00:57:11.080]   let alone Mountain Lion or Mavericks or Yosemite.
[00:57:11.080 --> 00:57:12.160]   - Yeah, that's right.
[00:57:12.160 --> 00:57:14.360]   - So it absolutely does happen.
[00:57:14.360 --> 00:57:16.880]   And Apple's security record has not been great.
[00:57:16.880 --> 00:57:18.240]   - How do you like the MacBook?
[00:57:19.240 --> 00:57:20.480]   - I like a lot about it.
[00:57:20.480 --> 00:57:21.920]   I love the screen, I love the lightness.
[00:57:21.920 --> 00:57:23.560]   I love the Force Touch trackpad
[00:57:23.560 --> 00:57:24.960]   and I don't like the keyboard.
[00:57:24.960 --> 00:57:28.280]   - See, I admire their willingness to really strike out.
[00:57:28.280 --> 00:57:32.680]   I mean, I don't mean not strike out in the baseball way,
[00:57:32.680 --> 00:57:33.840]   but to venture force.
[00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:34.680]   - Yes.
[00:57:34.680 --> 00:57:36.120]   - And try something new.
[00:57:36.120 --> 00:57:37.720]   And remember when the air came out,
[00:57:37.720 --> 00:57:40.720]   everybody on the Intel site, including Intel itself,
[00:57:40.720 --> 00:57:41.560]   imitated.
[00:57:41.560 --> 00:57:44.320]   And so, you know, it's an interesting thing
[00:57:44.320 --> 00:57:47.160]   to make a device that has one connector
[00:57:48.160 --> 00:57:51.720]   has, you know, nothing else is very light.
[00:57:51.720 --> 00:57:52.640]   I was just holding it.
[00:57:52.640 --> 00:57:54.200]   It's amazingly light.
[00:57:54.200 --> 00:57:55.120]   You don't like the keyboard,
[00:57:55.120 --> 00:57:56.640]   but I thought the keyboard was okay.
[00:57:56.640 --> 00:57:57.480]   - I don't want to let it.
[00:57:57.480 --> 00:57:58.320]   - I've read differing opinions.
[00:57:58.320 --> 00:57:59.400]   - It depends on how it feels.
[00:57:59.400 --> 00:58:01.200]   Some people have very strong opinions about keyboards.
[00:58:01.200 --> 00:58:02.200]   - The keyboards are very personal.
[00:58:02.200 --> 00:58:03.040]   - And they are.
[00:58:03.040 --> 00:58:05.120]   And this one has a lot less keyboard travel.
[00:58:05.120 --> 00:58:08.200]   So that's the amount of space that the key depresses
[00:58:08.200 --> 00:58:09.200]   when you press it.
[00:58:09.200 --> 00:58:11.680]   It's about, I'd say like between a third and a half
[00:58:11.680 --> 00:58:12.520]   of the travel.
[00:58:12.520 --> 00:58:13.720]   - The whole spring really feels nice.
[00:58:13.720 --> 00:58:15.360]   - So that's what they've done to make up
[00:58:15.360 --> 00:58:17.040]   for the reduced physical movement
[00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:18.760]   because they need to make this as thin as possible,
[00:58:18.760 --> 00:58:21.200]   is they've got the new butterfly switch.
[00:58:21.200 --> 00:58:23.240]   They've got the stainless steel pad at the bottom.
[00:58:23.240 --> 00:58:25.000]   It's clicky.
[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:26.280]   The keys are wider.
[00:58:26.280 --> 00:58:27.120]   They're more stable.
[00:58:27.120 --> 00:58:28.400]   I mean, there are all these other things they've done
[00:58:28.400 --> 00:58:29.880]   to make up for the fact that when you hit it,
[00:58:29.880 --> 00:58:31.200]   it doesn't move very much.
[00:58:31.200 --> 00:58:34.160]   For me, I just don't like that reduced travel,
[00:58:34.160 --> 00:58:35.760]   even with all of those other changes.
[00:58:35.760 --> 00:58:38.120]   To me, it's like a halfway point
[00:58:38.120 --> 00:58:40.840]   between typing on glass on a touchscreen
[00:58:40.840 --> 00:58:42.640]   and typing on a traditional keyboard.
[00:58:42.640 --> 00:58:44.560]   It's like a little bit better than on a touchscreen
[00:58:44.560 --> 00:58:46.320]   where there's no feedback, but it's not that far away.
[00:58:46.320 --> 00:58:47.680]   - I've used Ultra Thin Notebooks.
[00:58:47.680 --> 00:58:50.360]   The Acer S7, which I love, Windows Machine,
[00:58:50.360 --> 00:58:52.680]   also had a keyboard that was very difficult
[00:58:52.680 --> 00:58:56.520]   to type accurately with because it had so little travel.
[00:58:56.520 --> 00:58:58.200]   They fixed it in the second generation,
[00:58:58.200 --> 00:58:59.320]   the Haswell generation.
[00:58:59.320 --> 00:59:01.400]   I feel like this is better than that,
[00:59:01.400 --> 00:59:03.160]   but I haven't used it for that long,
[00:59:03.160 --> 00:59:05.600]   so I'll have to try it for a little bit longer.
[00:59:05.600 --> 00:59:06.640]   How about speed?
[00:59:06.640 --> 00:59:07.640]   'Cause that's the other concern.
[00:59:07.640 --> 00:59:08.760]   It's a core M process.
[00:59:08.760 --> 00:59:11.240]   - Yeah, it's about as fast as a MacBook Air from 2011.
[00:59:11.240 --> 00:59:12.080]   - Yeah.
[00:59:12.080 --> 00:59:14.600]   - And if you're somebody who cares about speed,
[00:59:14.600 --> 00:59:15.720]   it's gonna be an issue,
[00:59:15.720 --> 00:59:18.320]   but the fact is, I think most people
[00:59:18.320 --> 00:59:20.600]   don't use the processor speed they've got,
[00:59:20.600 --> 00:59:22.000]   and the SSD-- - That's absolutely true.
[00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:24.320]   - And the SSD really makes up for a lot of that
[00:59:24.320 --> 00:59:26.760]   because so much of what we think of as computer speed
[00:59:26.760 --> 00:59:28.280]   is actually slow disk.
[00:59:28.280 --> 00:59:30.360]   And now, I mean, the biggest upgrade I ever made
[00:59:30.360 --> 00:59:34.000]   in a computer was when I went to an SSD only system
[00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:36.360]   for the first time, because you then you realize,
[00:59:36.360 --> 00:59:38.680]   oh my God, I was waiting for disk that entire time.
[00:59:38.680 --> 00:59:40.720]   And now when I use a computer that's still got a spinning disc
[00:59:40.720 --> 00:59:42.160]   and it makes me very sad.
[00:59:42.160 --> 00:59:45.680]   So that makes up for a lot of the ills of the core M
[00:59:45.680 --> 00:59:47.320]   being slow.
[00:59:47.320 --> 00:59:49.720]   That said, if you're somebody who's like rendering video,
[00:59:49.720 --> 00:59:50.800]   it's a bad idea. - Don't run your video
[00:59:50.800 --> 00:59:53.120]   on a Mac. - I don't recommend it.
[00:59:53.120 --> 00:59:54.680]   - So Jason, who do you think should buy this?
[00:59:54.680 --> 00:59:57.440]   I mean, it still costs more than a MacBook Air.
[00:59:57.440 --> 00:59:59.200]   And I mean, you're paying for a design
[00:59:59.200 --> 01:00:00.800]   and a Retina screen. - Well, you're blessed
[01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:01.720]   battery life, who's bought this?
[01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:02.720]   - I like the Retina screen. - You're paying
[01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:03.560]   for the Retina screen.
[01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:05.440]   This is basically a MacBook Air with a Retina screen.
[01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:09.480]   And you're paying what you pay for the MacBook Pro 13
[01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:11.240]   and what you're getting is something
[01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:13.040]   that's not as powerful, but is thinner and lighter.
[01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:14.360]   And it's a matter of priorities.
[01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:16.280]   I mean, Apple now is making three different lines.
[01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:18.120]   They've essentially got five computer models,
[01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:19.200]   laptop models.
[01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:21.480]   So you gotta pick, you know, do you want cheaper,
[01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:24.040]   but no Retina, do you want more full featured
[01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:25.800]   and powerful with Retina, but heavier?
[01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:28.000]   Or do you want something that's not very powerful,
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.080]   but has Retina and is super thin and light?
[01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:33.480]   You know, pick two of these things.
[01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:35.880]   So I think for a lot of people who want that Retina display
[01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:37.960]   and don't really care that it's not super powerful
[01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:40.440]   'cause they're not gonna use that super power anyway,
[01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:41.280]   I think it makes sense.
[01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:43.560]   In the end, this is gonna be the new MacBook Air, essentially,
[01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:44.400]   right?
[01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:47.120]   The Air is around because they can make a non Retina laptop
[01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:49.160]   for less than 1,000.
[01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:53.320]   And you can't really make Apple can't sell a Retina MacBook
[01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:55.160]   for less than 1,000 yet.
[01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:56.640]   And so that's why it's still around.
[01:00:56.640 --> 01:00:58.600]   But I think it's, I think it's, you know,
[01:00:58.600 --> 01:01:01.040]   today it is of limited appeal.
[01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:03.160]   And in six months, it'll be more appealing
[01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:04.880]   and in a year it'll be even more appealing,
[01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:06.840]   especially as the USB-C stuff's coming out.
[01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:08.200]   - I love the Type-C.
[01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:09.760]   - So you have it on a Pixel and I love it.
[01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:11.080]   I just love it.
[01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:14.320]   - I get the kind of consensus that it's of limited appeal,
[01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:16.440]   but I don't understand that, honestly.
[01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:19.880]   I think it's of limited appeal to us and to tech people.
[01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:24.720]   But again, anecdotally, I've talked to people
[01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:26.080]   and like looking at, you know,
[01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:27.640]   not to use the tiredest cliche in the book,
[01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:30.640]   looking at how my wife uses their computer, for example,
[01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:32.440]   I don't think most people plug anything
[01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:34.120]   into their computers ever.
[01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:34.960]   - Oh yeah.
[01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:36.440]   - I mean, I mean, phone, like, they're made--
[01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:37.800]   - Well, but we're unusual because we--
[01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:38.640]   - We're unusual, yeah.
[01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:43.040]   - I mean, I think for especially in the big difference here
[01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:46.120]   is that most people's camera is their phone
[01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:47.760]   and now that that is the case,
[01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:49.320]   that was kind of the last thing
[01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:51.520]   that people plugged in regularly.
[01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:55.360]   And now having the USB-C being kind of like an emergency hatch
[01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:56.720]   where there's a port if you need it,
[01:01:56.720 --> 01:01:59.680]   the expectations you don't use it most of the time,
[01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:03.040]   I think that's gonna be totally fine
[01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:04.280]   for the majority of people.
[01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:06.960]   Again, I would only buy one
[01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:08.600]   if I had a separate desktop computer,
[01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:09.680]   like I know Jason has--
[01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:10.760]   - It's an extra-- - Not the high maximum.
[01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:11.920]   - Exactly, it's not a--
[01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:14.760]   - Right, but I think for the majority of people though,
[01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:17.760]   it's perfectly fine as their normal computer.
[01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:20.400]   And I think Jason's right,
[01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:22.920]   it's the MacBook Air still exists
[01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:25.120]   because they can't get it under $1,000.
[01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:28.160]   But I think it's gonna be,
[01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:29.640]   I think it's gonna be more successful
[01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:30.480]   than people think.
[01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:31.320]   - So that's right.
[01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:32.280]   - I mean, it's spectacular in person.
[01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:33.320]   It's backwarded, right?
[01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:34.560]   - Yeah, it's-- - Again, it's hard to--
[01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:36.160]   - It's always hard to tell with a new computer.
[01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:39.040]   The people who complain about the processor being this core M
[01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:41.360]   are gonna be the same people who complain about the one port.
[01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:43.200]   And it's like, there is a whole,
[01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:44.720]   and it's the people who are in our chat room
[01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:46.840]   and watch the show, and that's fine.
[01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:48.120]   Not every product is for everybody,
[01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:49.760]   but there's a whole, Ben's right,
[01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:50.920]   they're a whole class of people
[01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:52.400]   who just don't care about all that.
[01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:53.880]   And they want it thin and light,
[01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:55.320]   and they want the pretty retina screen,
[01:02:55.320 --> 01:02:56.160]   and it's got all that.
[01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:57.760]   - It's so light.
[01:02:57.760 --> 01:02:58.880]   - There are a lot of nice things about it.
[01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:01.080]   I just think we're gonna,
[01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:03.040]   all of our concerns about it
[01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:04.360]   are gonna fall away over time.
[01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:07.280]   And then, just like with the air in two or three years,
[01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:09.960]   we're gonna say, oh yeah, of course, it makes sense.
[01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:13.040]   - That's that's mostly people who don't care about retina.
[01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:13.880]   - Oh, I care.
[01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:14.720]   - Sadly, no.
[01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:16.320]   - Once you start using a high resolution screen,
[01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:17.400]   it's hard to go back.
[01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:21.080]   - No, you care, the people who don't care about--
[01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:23.360]   - Oh, I think that there's only one port and--
[01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:24.840]   - Don't you think people can tell,
[01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:26.440]   they look at immediately, you look at,
[01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:28.080]   once you start using it and you go,
[01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:29.600]   well, now I see the difference.
[01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:31.000]   I agree, until you see the difference,
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:32.080]   you don't know the difference.
[01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:34.120]   But it's like the difference in HD and SD.
[01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:36.880]   I mean, there were people who said when HD came out,
[01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:38.680]   oh, nobody's gonna, yeah, you care
[01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:40.720]   once you see the two together and you know.
[01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:42.040]   - But you know, as computer nerds,
[01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:44.040]   we also get hung up on specs, right?
[01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:46.240]   But the most important specs for that are,
[01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:47.280]   it's thin and it's light.
[01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:48.360]   Those are the most important things,
[01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:50.400]   looking at it and saying, oh my God, it's so thin.
[01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:51.880]   Oh, it's so light. - This screen looks remote.
[01:03:51.880 --> 01:03:53.160]   - And the screen is good too, right?
[01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:56.200]   So I think, I think, you know, that comes first for people.
[01:03:56.200 --> 01:03:58.960]   And it's very easy for computer people to say,
[01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:00.880]   oh, that's all just about looks.
[01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:02.600]   And it's really about what's inside, right?
[01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:03.440]   - It's functional.
[01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:04.600]   - People, it's about looks.
[01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:05.520]   - You know how to come around?
[01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:08.200]   - I mocked the Chromebooks when they came out
[01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:09.520]   and I completely come around on them.
[01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:11.360]   - This reminds me a lot of like a thin Chromebook.
[01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:12.520]   - I love the Chromebook.
[01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:15.600]   - Our concept of what a computer is has changed dramatically.
[01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:17.520]   The Pixel's incredible.
[01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:19.080]   Incredible.
[01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:20.760]   All right, now we're finally done with Apple.
[01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:22.560]   I'm not gonna, not one more word about Apple.
[01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:23.400]   - All right.
[01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:24.240]   - We're over.
[01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:25.160]   - I can go home now.
[01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:27.000]   - No, no, stay here 'cause there's other stuff.
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:27.840]   - All right.
[01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:29.480]   - But I'm just not gonna do any more Apple stuff.
[01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:31.920]   So for those of you who've been sitting through the podcast
[01:04:31.920 --> 01:04:32.760]   with your fingers and ears going,
[01:04:32.760 --> 01:04:33.600]   "I need your need your need."
[01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:35.120]   And I don't wanna hear it now.
[01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:36.520]   You can now take your fingers out of the ears.
[01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:37.520]   - You got a motion to them.
[01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:38.360]   So just come back.
[01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:40.920]   - The Darth Vader is Luke's.
[01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:44.080]   By the way, I, (laughs)
[01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:47.280]   I enjoyed, I'm actually rewatching Star Wars
[01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:49.080]   'cause I bought all six of them.
[01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:52.920]   Bought it on Google so that I could play it then on iTunes
[01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:56.680]   and on Voodoo 'cause of the Disney Anywhere thing.
[01:04:56.680 --> 01:05:00.280]   Don't buy it on Amazon 'cause then Disney Anywhere won't work
[01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:04.280]   and Disney won't have episode four, A New Hope
[01:05:04.280 --> 01:05:08.560]   because that's a Fox and it's, this is a big deal.
[01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:10.760]   I don't know why.
[01:05:10.760 --> 01:05:14.600]   It is the most recent version, not with all the new--
[01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:15.760]   - Yes, special editions.
[01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:16.920]   - Special editions.
[01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:18.320]   I suspect it's the Blu-ray.
[01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:19.400]   - Not the original originals.
[01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:20.240]   - Yeah.
[01:05:20.240 --> 01:05:21.080]   - Yeah.
[01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:22.080]   - I got really caught up at this
[01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:23.920]   because we're watching, yeah, we're watching them going,
[01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:24.740]   I don't, what?
[01:05:24.740 --> 01:05:26.680]   Hunshot first.
[01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:29.240]   And then I went to Wikipedia and I found out
[01:05:29.240 --> 01:05:31.760]   there's this whole movement, there's a documentary about,
[01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:35.040]   whole movement of people who wanna get back
[01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:36.360]   to the original Star Wars.
[01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:38.040]   - In fact, there's a guy who actually just got hired
[01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:41.600]   to do professional 4K restorations of other films
[01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:43.760]   whose name is Harmony and Harmony.
[01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:46.040]   The Harmony's despecialized editions.
[01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:48.320]   Which it's amazing, he's used like 20 different sources
[01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:51.800]   to create the highest resolution possible equivalent
[01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:53.240]   of the original releases.
[01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:57.480]   - And you know what's annoying is, George could do this,
[01:05:57.480 --> 01:05:58.520]   but George has decided,
[01:05:58.520 --> 01:06:01.080]   I don't like the original version.
[01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:03.480]   So just because you grew up with it,
[01:06:03.480 --> 01:06:05.320]   doesn't mean I'm gonna support it.
[01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:08.160]   - So my theory is that at some point we will see those
[01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:11.560]   and it'll be sold as like for the true film buff
[01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:15.240]   and fans of the '70s version and they'll soft pedal it,
[01:06:15.240 --> 01:06:17.160]   they won't say it's the real version.
[01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:19.560]   - In front of the harmy video about how he did it,
[01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:23.880]   they've got an ad for the digital--
[01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:24.880]   - For the special editions.
[01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:26.200]   - Special editions.
[01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:28.520]   - Are they confused?
[01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:31.920]   So it's Google and it's automatic.
[01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:33.120]   They don't know what they're doing.
[01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:35.240]   It's really, if you haven't watched this YouTube video
[01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:37.120]   on how they made the despecialized edition, it's--
[01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:39.520]   - It's staggering how many, they use the laser disc,
[01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:42.960]   they use a TV broadcast, they use a 35 millimeter print
[01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:43.800]   that they scan.
[01:06:43.800 --> 01:06:44.640]   - TV broadcast.
[01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:46.600]   - Yeah, there was an HD TV broadcast that had stuff
[01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:48.320]   that was never in the Blu-ray
[01:06:48.320 --> 01:06:50.560]   and so it was a high res version that they use.
[01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:51.840]   So they took all of these sources
[01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:52.840]   and this is what the video is.
[01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:56.160]   It's amazing and of course they're not legally available,
[01:06:56.160 --> 01:07:00.200]   but the work they did, this is not like some minor fan edit.
[01:07:00.200 --> 01:07:01.040]   They have--
[01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:02.360]   - Oh this guy's insane.
[01:07:02.360 --> 01:07:04.520]   - It is, they color corrected it all
[01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:06.800]   to look like the right color palette from the original.
[01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:07.800]   It's great.
[01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:09.680]   - Well and they do point out there's some really horrible
[01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:11.000]   stuff that Lucas did.
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:11.840]   - Yeah.
[01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:17.160]   - I mean come on, you can't change any Baru's dialogue.
[01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:18.200]   - No you can't.
[01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:20.120]   The blue, at least the milk is still blue.
[01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:22.640]   The milk is still blue, they didn't change that.
[01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:23.600]   It's really fascinating.
[01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:24.840]   Where do you get the despecialized?
[01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:25.680]   - Probably--
[01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:26.720]   - On the internet, secret spot.
[01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:27.560]   - In the dark corners of the internet.
[01:07:27.560 --> 01:07:28.400]   - In the dark corners of the internet.
[01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:30.800]   - It's not that dark, it's pretty easy.
[01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:31.640]   - No it's very easy.
[01:07:31.640 --> 01:07:33.960]   - See I was 21 when it came out.
[01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:35.720]   So I didn't grow up with this,
[01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:37.560]   but I understand if you were eight years old
[01:07:37.560 --> 01:07:40.520]   and you watched the original Star Wars 24 times,
[01:07:40.520 --> 01:07:41.440]   you're gonna be upset.
[01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:44.280]   - Well those 90s Mac based special effects
[01:07:44.280 --> 01:07:46.480]   that they built in the special edition now look old.
[01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:47.920]   And in fact if you're gonna look old,
[01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:50.080]   you might as well look at the original models.
[01:07:50.080 --> 01:07:52.000]   - Right, that's actually a good point.
[01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:52.920]   - So it'll happen.
[01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:53.760]   They'll come back some day.
[01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:56.320]   - Which says the original Star Wars was only one third
[01:07:56.320 --> 01:07:57.160]   of what I wanted to do
[01:07:57.160 --> 01:07:59.560]   and I've just been making it better all along.
[01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:00.400]   - Yeah.
[01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:01.960]   (laughing)
[01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:02.800]   - There you go.
[01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:04.440]   - Beautiful laugh.
[01:08:04.440 --> 01:08:06.360]   - That's why like in episode seven,
[01:08:06.360 --> 01:08:08.600]   JJ Abrams seems to be going back to the puppet thing
[01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:10.400]   which I think really makes more sense.
[01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:12.040]   And you know everything that we've seen
[01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:14.400]   from like behind the scenes and stuff like that,
[01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:16.520]   he's been using actual like animatronics
[01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:18.040]   and muppets or whatever.
[01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:19.920]   And that just feels more real.
[01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:22.400]   We don't need CG stormtroopers.
[01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:26.440]   - I'm watching the Empire Strikes Back.
[01:08:26.440 --> 01:08:28.960]   And Yoda really is obviously Fazibear.
[01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:31.280]   - Yeah, I think we're Grover.
[01:08:31.280 --> 01:08:32.440]   - Or Grover.
[01:08:32.440 --> 01:08:35.880]   - I think people could put up with the making,
[01:08:35.880 --> 01:08:39.560]   you know having more effects and stuff like that.
[01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:42.160]   People would be justifiably annoyed
[01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:44.840]   but when you get into changing plot details.
[01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:45.680]   - Yeah.
[01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:47.000]   - Like I mean that's why people focus
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:48.520]   on the Han shot first thing
[01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:50.440]   'cause that like changes the fundamental nature
[01:08:50.440 --> 01:08:51.280]   of the director.
[01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:52.120]   - Right.
[01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:55.120]   - And that puts the lie to Lucas's argument
[01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:57.120]   that oh this is what I always wanted to do.
[01:08:57.120 --> 01:08:59.920]   Because no if you wanted Han to shoot first
[01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:01.600]   or if you wanted Han to shoot second
[01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:03.000]   you would have him shoot second but you didn't.
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:03.840]   - You had him shoot first.
[01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:05.200]   - I think right exactly.
[01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:08.560]   And that's if he had only done the extra stuff
[01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:10.280]   I think people would still complain.
[01:09:10.280 --> 01:09:12.160]   But I think a lot of us including myself back
[01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:14.280]   you know get over it it's still the same movie.
[01:09:14.280 --> 01:09:16.120]   But now but once you're actually changing
[01:09:16.120 --> 01:09:16.960]   there's stuff.
[01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:17.800]   - Wait a minute.
[01:09:17.800 --> 01:09:19.280]   - They took the Ewoks song out.
[01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:20.280]   - Yeah and they put in a different.
[01:09:20.280 --> 01:09:22.200]   - That's not okay.
[01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:23.040]   - They got the Yub Nub.
[01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:26.080]   - Yeah and there's no Yub Nub and it shows like
[01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:27.880]   scenes from the prequels at the end.
[01:09:27.880 --> 01:09:29.280]   - That's not okay.
[01:09:29.280 --> 01:09:30.120]   - It's not cool.
[01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:31.440]   (laughing)
[01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:33.120]   Yeah I think it'll eventually get resolved.
[01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:34.480]   I think the harm is to specialize shows
[01:09:34.480 --> 01:09:35.680]   that there is a market for this.
[01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:36.520]   - No kidding.
[01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:39.120]   - And eventually now the Disney controls Lucasfilm.
[01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:40.280]   I think it will happen.
[01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:41.840]   Like I said to make George feel better
[01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:44.120]   they'll be like we'll have the special special editions
[01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:46.760]   over here and we'll have the original editions over here
[01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:48.560]   and everybody will be happy.
[01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:50.400]   - It'll be for the nostalgic.
[01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:53.600]   - If you like the originals seek out the internet.
[01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:55.320]   - Look at the motion blur that was introduced.
[01:09:55.320 --> 01:09:56.160]   - Permene.
[01:09:56.160 --> 01:09:58.480]   - But it's really crappy digitization.
[01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:00.080]   I mean just terrible.
[01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:03.080]   All right I didn't mean to get into this but.
[01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:03.920]   - Star Wars segment.
[01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:04.920]   Now no more Star Wars either.
[01:10:04.920 --> 01:10:06.000]   No Apple no Star Wars.
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:07.160]   - No no there might be more stars.
[01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:08.000]   - All right fair enough.
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.480]   No promises.
[01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:13.280]   - Yub Nub will appear later in the show to sing.
[01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:14.400]   - That's a title this year right?
[01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:15.240]   Yub Nub.
[01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:16.080]   - Yub Nub.
[01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:16.920]   - Yub Nub.
[01:10:16.920 --> 01:10:19.160]   - What did they do with Yub Nub?
[01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:21.680]   - I showed it to they brought to you by GoToMeeting.
[01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:25.760]   Oh those folks at Citrix they make such a useful product
[01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:27.600]   we use it all the time.
[01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:29.080]   I don't want to do a phone meeting anymore
[01:10:29.080 --> 01:10:30.360]   without GoToMeeting running.
[01:10:30.360 --> 01:10:32.800]   First of all it's a great way to do a conference call
[01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:34.480]   but then if you want you can share screens
[01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:36.760]   you could turn on the HD camera see each other.
[01:10:36.760 --> 01:10:40.480]   It makes a meeting over the internet as good
[01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:42.960]   or maybe even better than a meeting in person.
[01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:45.960]   And with GoToMeeting you can meet from any computer
[01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:48.600]   any tablet, any smartphone, no travel expenses,
[01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:50.440]   no traffic.
[01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:53.040]   Your team could join by clicking a link, no signups, no
[01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:55.760]   it's really easy if you're sharing a meeting
[01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:57.800]   for the first time when somebody's never used before.
[01:10:57.800 --> 01:10:59.840]   It really takes 30 seconds and they're up and running.
[01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:00.680]   They love it.
[01:11:00.680 --> 01:11:04.280]   HD quality webcam makes it seem like you're in the room.
[01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:05.920]   You can share screens.
[01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:07.160]   Everybody sees what you're seeing.
[01:11:07.160 --> 01:11:08.520]   I want you to try it free.
[01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:10.280]   This is the one, this is the killer.
[01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:13.120]   This is literally the number one meeting app.
[01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:14.440]   You gotta try it.
[01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:15.760]   30 days free for you.
[01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:16.600]   That's it.
[01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:17.400]   No credit card or anything.
[01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:20.640]   Just click try it free on GoToMeeting.com.
[01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:21.480]   Go to Meeting.com.
[01:11:21.480 --> 01:11:23.480]   Just asking you try it free.
[01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:24.320]   See what you think.
[01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:26.960]   GoToMeeting.com.
[01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:28.400]   We thank them so much for their support.
[01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:30.920]   Long test, it's been a long time.
[01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:31.760]   Supportive.
[01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:34.440]   You know we're coming close to our 10th anniversary.
[01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:37.640]   Next week will be our 10th anniversary show
[01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:41.960]   and all the original folks from Twitch will be here.
[01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:44.680]   John C. Devorak, Patrick Norton, Kevin Rose,
[01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:48.280]   Robert Herring, Aaron, Roger Chang, David Prager.
[01:11:48.280 --> 01:11:49.360]   It's gonna be a lot of fun.
[01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:50.960]   We're gonna look back.
[01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:53.800]   We have video, we have lots of stuff coming up.
[01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:58.320]   So make sure you set your, set your DVR.
[01:11:58.320 --> 01:11:59.840]   I don't know, whatever easy you do.
[01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:01.320]   (laughing)
[01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:03.480]   To watch next Sunday's Twitch,
[01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:06.160]   the 10th anniversary edition.
[01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:07.680]   I'm very excited about that.
[01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:09.840]   If you missed anything from this week on Tech,
[01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:11.600]   this week in Tech, you missed some great stuff.
[01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:13.840]   And we have a edited down.
[01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:17.160]   I caught a harmies edition of Twitch right here.
[01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:19.160]   Previously on Twitch.
[01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:20.080]   (upbeat music)
[01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:21.080]   Hi, how's it going?
[01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:22.520]   I'm getting a little freaked out right now.
[01:12:22.520 --> 01:12:24.560]   I'm really, this is a slightly freaked out.
[01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:26.080]   (laughing)
[01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:29.960]   Before you buy, this is the Samsung Galaxy S6.
[01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:32.600]   This is the best Android phone on the market today.
[01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:34.440]   And I've looked at them all.
[01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:37.160]   It's probably gonna be the phone in 2015.
[01:12:37.160 --> 01:12:38.200]   Floss Weekly.
[01:12:38.200 --> 01:12:40.600]   We see people who would start talking about a certain issue.
[01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:43.200]   And suddenly there's about 300 people
[01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:44.800]   that would descend on them on Twitter.
[01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:47.240]   And Twitter lacks the filtering mechanisms
[01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:49.480]   to allow you to block out any of that abuse.
[01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:51.320]   And what did you do to sort of combat some of that
[01:12:51.320 --> 01:12:52.520]   with regard to game-regate?
[01:12:52.520 --> 01:12:55.000]   Well, the short version of the story is I got drunk
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:56.960]   and wrote a 200 line per-all script
[01:12:56.960 --> 01:12:58.480]   which broke the internet.
[01:12:58.480 --> 01:12:59.600]   This week in Google.
[01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:03.560]   Google has a patent for a cow avoidance mechanism
[01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:06.520]   in their self-driving cars.
[01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:08.160]   The cow-- I have a vision that some Googlers
[01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:09.160]   get patents just for the--
[01:13:09.160 --> 01:13:10.920]   You think this is just for the laws?
[01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:11.760]   Yeah.
[01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:13.640]   Cow avoidance patent.
[01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:14.880]   Live from Petaloma.
[01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:16.280]   Here, have an egg.
[01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:17.680]   (laughs)
[01:13:17.680 --> 01:13:19.280]   And I believe that this is actually the way
[01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:21.080]   we're gonna be bringing you into the TwiP TV network
[01:13:21.080 --> 01:13:21.920]   from now on, right?
[01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:22.760]   We're just gonna--
[01:13:22.760 --> 01:13:24.120]   They're gonna be ahead in a jar.
[01:13:24.120 --> 01:13:25.120]   (laughs)
[01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:25.960]   I love it.
[01:13:25.960 --> 01:13:27.880]   (laughs)
[01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:28.720]   I hope you saw it.
[01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:29.760]   Do we have a week ahead?
[01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:30.920]   All right, let's see what's coming up
[01:13:30.920 --> 01:13:32.440]   because it's got a big week ahead.
[01:13:32.440 --> 01:13:33.600]   Mike Elgin.
[01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:34.400]   Coming up this week,
[01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:36.600]   Intel reports earnings Tuesday.
[01:13:36.600 --> 01:13:38.680]   Netflix does the same on Wednesday.
[01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:40.880]   Also on Wednesday, Huawei has set to launch its
[01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:43.440]   Ascend P8 flagship smartphone
[01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:45.200]   at a special event in London.
[01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:49.160]   And Etsy's long-awaited IPO happens Thursday.
[01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:51.600]   As it's coming up this week, back to you, Leo.
[01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:53.920]   Mr. Michael Elgin.
[01:13:53.920 --> 01:13:55.880]   Our news director, Monday through Friday,
[01:13:55.880 --> 01:13:58.400]   10 a.m. Pacific, 1 p.m. Eastern Time,
[01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:02.040]   1700 UCC for Tech News today.
[01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:03.200]   And our daily look at Tech News.
[01:14:03.200 --> 01:14:05.280]   And of course, there's Tech News tonight at 4 p.m.
[01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:08.800]   Pacific, 7 p.m. Eastern Time, Megan Moroni hosts.
[01:14:08.800 --> 01:14:10.480]   That's 2300 UTC.
[01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:12.600]   It's kind of your, before you go to bed,
[01:14:12.600 --> 01:14:13.960]   you can watch that.
[01:14:13.960 --> 01:14:18.440]   Well, we covered Star Wars
[01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:19.600]   and we covered Apple versus Android.
[01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:20.960]   I think there's nothing else to say.
[01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:22.440]   Who else can we make angry?
[01:14:22.440 --> 01:14:23.880]   (laughs)
[01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:25.400]   On the internet today, Leo.
[01:14:25.400 --> 01:14:27.440]   You can tell us what happens in episode four
[01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:29.400]   of Game of Thrones season five.
[01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:30.480]   (laughs)
[01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:31.480]   Spoiler alert.
[01:14:31.480 --> 01:14:32.320]   Oh my God.
[01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:33.480]   How many die?
[01:14:33.480 --> 01:14:35.120]   Twitter's actually getting quite aggressive
[01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:38.760]   in the marketplace, cutting off two of its firehose.
[01:14:38.760 --> 01:14:42.400]   Subscribers, what is the Twitter firehose, Steve Kovac?
[01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:45.560]   That's these certain specialized companies
[01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:48.400]   that they give full access, they call it the firehose,
[01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:51.400]   to literally every tweet and every favorite
[01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:55.240]   and everything that goes into, that we input into Twitter.
[01:14:55.240 --> 01:14:58.520]   And different companies do really cool stuff with it.
[01:14:58.520 --> 01:14:59.880]   Not anymore.
[01:14:59.880 --> 01:15:00.720]   Not anymore.
[01:15:00.720 --> 01:15:03.760]   They're very restrictive of who they let have that data.
[01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:05.320]   And sometimes they buy the companies
[01:15:05.320 --> 01:15:07.240]   that do really interesting stuff with that data.
[01:15:07.240 --> 01:15:08.560]   Like Gint.
[01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:10.160]   Gint. Yep, that was the last one.
[01:15:10.160 --> 01:15:12.240]   And so it's not unusual.
[01:15:12.240 --> 01:15:13.400]   They've been doing this.
[01:15:13.400 --> 01:15:17.480]   I think this company has been doing a lot of social media
[01:15:17.480 --> 01:15:19.920]   analytics and now they're boosting up their Facebook business
[01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:21.560]   instead of Twitter, which probably makes more sense
[01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:23.480]   more people on Facebook anyway.
[01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:25.040]   But I think the firehose is interesting.
[01:15:25.040 --> 01:15:26.920]   There are a lot of cool companies doing cool stuff.
[01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:29.480]   My favorite, just as a journalist and a news junkie,
[01:15:29.480 --> 01:15:30.320]   is DataMiner.
[01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:31.400]   Have you heard of them?
[01:15:31.400 --> 01:15:32.240]   Tell me about it.
[01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:33.080]   They're really cool.
[01:15:33.080 --> 01:15:37.320]   They're building this live dashboard for journalists.
[01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:42.040]   And so basically, if someone tweets about a tornado hitting
[01:15:42.040 --> 01:15:46.200]   or some kind of disaster or anything like that,
[01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:49.120]   journalists who are on DataMiner can get instant alerts
[01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:50.040]   for those kind of things.
[01:15:50.040 --> 01:15:53.720]   And we at Business Insider have actually been the first on some
[01:15:53.720 --> 01:15:55.880]   stories because we get alerted to that kind of stuff.
[01:15:55.880 --> 01:15:58.680]   It's a really cool product and just shows the power
[01:15:58.680 --> 01:16:01.120]   some of these companies can have when they have that firehose
[01:16:01.120 --> 01:16:02.720]   of Twitter lets them.
[01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:04.920]   Twitter said they're not going to let anybody have the firehose
[01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:05.240]   anymore.
[01:16:05.240 --> 01:16:06.800]   They've got their own internal analytics
[01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:09.240]   since the acquisition of GNIP.
[01:16:09.240 --> 01:16:13.760]   And it just shows-- I mean, I feel bad for these--
[01:16:13.760 --> 01:16:16.360]   DataSift, I think, is one of them.
[01:16:16.360 --> 01:16:19.280]   And they're going to shift over to mining analytics
[01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:20.360]   from Facebook.
[01:16:20.360 --> 01:16:23.480]   But I have to think that their customers are going to be
[01:16:23.480 --> 01:16:27.760]   a little unhappy when DataSift gets cut off in a month
[01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:31.400]   and no longer will you get those insights.
[01:16:31.400 --> 01:16:34.720]   Not only will their customers be unhappy with their investors,
[01:16:34.720 --> 01:16:40.000]   they've raised $78 million to date.
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:44.000]   And I think you've got to think that company is a lot less
[01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:47.760]   valuable than all of a sudden.
[01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:50.400]   I feel bad because I feel like Twitter made its bones
[01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:54.560]   by having these open platform and letting people do stuff
[01:16:54.560 --> 01:16:54.840]   with it.
[01:16:54.840 --> 01:16:57.200]   And that's one of the reasons Twitter got so good.
[01:16:57.200 --> 01:16:59.800]   And now that they're successful, they're
[01:16:59.800 --> 01:17:04.680]   going to pull up the ramp and say, OK, we'll take it from here.
[01:17:04.680 --> 01:17:07.640]   Well, the issue is Twitter isn't that successful.
[01:17:07.640 --> 01:17:10.320]   I mean, it's a phenomenal service.
[01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:13.440]   There's-- every time I have a company, I reiterate this.
[01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:16.760]   But there's no tech product or service that's more important
[01:17:16.760 --> 01:17:17.680]   than me personally.
[01:17:17.680 --> 01:17:23.280]   Like, I would gladly trade away my iPhone and my Mac
[01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:26.480]   for a Windows computer and Android phone
[01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:29.920]   and with Twitter as opposed to the opposite.
[01:17:29.920 --> 01:17:33.600]   That said, realistically, the reason
[01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:37.040]   why it's so great for me is also what makes it so valuable
[01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:40.160]   is that it understands me, it understands my interests.
[01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:42.960]   Like, this idea of there being an interest graph as opposed
[01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:45.280]   to a social graph is super powerful.
[01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:47.080]   And quite frankly, if you're an advertiser
[01:17:47.080 --> 01:17:49.880]   and you want to connect to me, Twitter is the best way to do it.
[01:17:49.880 --> 01:17:53.560]   And that's why Twitter is monetizing quite well.
[01:17:53.560 --> 01:17:56.280]   The problem is there just aren't that many people on Twitter.
[01:17:56.280 --> 01:18:00.600]   I mean, the official count is 250 million or something
[01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:01.360]   like that.
[01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:05.360]   I think there's strong reason to believe the actual number
[01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:10.560]   of regular users is significantly less than that.
[01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:12.400]   And that's a problem for them.
[01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:15.160]   And so I think what you see and will continue to see--
[01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:17.360]   and from a business perspective, justifiably so--
[01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:22.000]   is them pulling in all potential money-making avenues.
[01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.240]   And this is one of them.
[01:18:24.240 --> 01:18:26.400]   To be frank, probably in 2012, when
[01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:29.120]   they cut off the Access for Third-Party Twitter clients,
[01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:31.400]   like, oh, but you can still do this other stuff,
[01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:33.200]   they should have ripped the band-aid completely off
[01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:34.640]   and pulled it all in-house.
[01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:36.120]   If you're going to screw developers,
[01:18:36.120 --> 01:18:39.240]   screw them all at once instead of dribbling it out
[01:18:39.240 --> 01:18:41.920]   over the years.
[01:18:41.920 --> 01:18:47.280]   But I think it's a business kind of imperative for Twitter.
[01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:49.360]   And I agree with you, there's no question
[01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:52.840]   that Twitter was built on the back of Third-Party developers.
[01:18:52.840 --> 01:18:56.240]   But I think it's just a reality of their business
[01:18:56.240 --> 01:18:57.960]   that they have to do this.
[01:18:57.960 --> 01:19:00.160]   Well, when Hillary Clinton wanted to announce her candidacy
[01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:04.600]   today, she took to YouTube and Twitter to do it.
[01:19:04.600 --> 01:19:06.400]   And that tweet, which everybody was watching--
[01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:08.360]   and by the way, she completely redesigned her Twitter page
[01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:08.880]   and everything.
[01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:11.040]   It's clear, this is the campaign page.
[01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:15.200]   And this is a big part of what a presidential campaign is
[01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:15.720]   today.
[01:19:15.720 --> 01:19:17.280]   Twitter apparently pushing celebrities
[01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:19.240]   according to TechCrunch and publishers
[01:19:19.240 --> 01:19:22.920]   to stop using Meerkat and start using Twitter's own Paris
[01:19:22.920 --> 01:19:23.280]   scope.
[01:19:23.280 --> 01:19:24.960]   It is shocking.
[01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:29.960]   Yeah, it fits in the same vein.
[01:19:29.960 --> 01:19:31.640]   It just feels petty, though.
[01:19:31.640 --> 01:19:33.240]   Come on, really?
[01:19:33.240 --> 01:19:34.560]   But that's like Don Bites, man.
[01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:35.320]   I mean, come on.
[01:19:35.320 --> 01:19:36.960]   What do you think is going to happen?
[01:19:36.960 --> 01:19:39.000]   Right.
[01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:42.880]   They have an exclusive with Madonna or McDonough.
[01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:44.320]   McDonough.
[01:19:44.320 --> 01:19:46.160]   Now, there's a brand I'm interested in.
[01:19:46.160 --> 01:19:52.360]   And apparently, according to TechCrunch,
[01:19:52.360 --> 01:19:54.080]   Twitter has been contacting celebrities
[01:19:54.080 --> 01:19:56.560]   who use Meerkat, trying to convince them
[01:19:56.560 --> 01:19:58.360]   that Meerkat is dying.
[01:19:58.360 --> 01:19:59.520]   And they should use Periscope.
[01:19:59.520 --> 01:20:01.480]   Instead, sources also say Twitter
[01:20:01.480 --> 01:20:03.160]   has been in touch with media companies
[01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:05.600]   that use Meerkat going so far as to apply.
[01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:08.180]   If they don't exclusively use Periscope,
[01:20:08.180 --> 01:20:11.600]   Twitter could cut off their access to amplify, which
[01:20:11.600 --> 01:20:14.600]   is some sort of thing that--
[01:20:14.600 --> 01:20:15.360]   Magical secret.
[01:20:15.360 --> 01:20:16.280]   --meagical secret.
[01:20:16.280 --> 01:20:16.760]   Twitter thing.
[01:20:16.760 --> 01:20:17.280]   Twitter thing.
[01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:19.360]   But has it Meerkat usage and Periscope usage
[01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:22.840]   kind of evened out now after the glow of the Periscope launch
[01:20:22.840 --> 01:20:23.720]   kind of waned off?
[01:20:23.720 --> 01:20:25.600]   And now it seems like they're equal.
[01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:29.880]   But at the same time, Madonna tried her Meerkat premiere.
[01:20:29.880 --> 01:20:31.280]   And it totally bombed.
[01:20:31.280 --> 01:20:31.760]   What happened?
[01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:32.440]   I didn't see it.
[01:20:32.440 --> 01:20:33.840]   And that's one of the problems with these.
[01:20:33.840 --> 01:20:35.600]   If you weren't there live, you ain't going to see it.
[01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:36.080]   What happened?
[01:20:36.080 --> 01:20:37.440]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:38.960]   Apparently, it didn't work really well.
[01:20:38.960 --> 01:20:41.040]   And then she went somewhere else or something like that.
[01:20:41.040 --> 01:20:42.520]   I just heard-- I think it's a watch.
[01:20:42.520 --> 01:20:45.080]   I got an alert that Madonna's video is coming.
[01:20:45.080 --> 01:20:47.840]   I don't know if that's the audience you want to be showing.
[01:20:47.840 --> 01:20:49.800]   It's still a bunch of tech journalists using it.
[01:20:49.800 --> 01:20:52.520]   I don't know if that's how you should premiere your next music
[01:20:52.520 --> 01:20:52.960]   video.
[01:20:52.960 --> 01:20:56.680]   What's stopping Snapchat from doing this?
[01:20:56.680 --> 01:20:57.960]   Kind of seems like live streaming?
[01:20:57.960 --> 01:20:59.160]   Live streaming that like Snapchat.
[01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:00.080]   They do something similar.
[01:21:00.080 --> 01:21:01.520]   They have their stories.
[01:21:01.520 --> 01:21:02.000]   Right.
[01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:02.840]   They call it live.
[01:21:02.840 --> 01:21:04.520]   It's not like directly live.
[01:21:04.520 --> 01:21:06.920]   But those seem to be more popular because it's
[01:21:06.920 --> 01:21:11.920]   like a curation of stuff, either like Coachella or Final
[01:21:11.920 --> 01:21:15.040]   4 or stuff in your neighborhood.
[01:21:15.040 --> 01:21:17.520]   That stuff seems to be doing really well because it's really
[01:21:17.520 --> 01:21:22.800]   nicely curated. It's not as raw as just a straight up livestream.
[01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:27.920]   Yeah, I think big picture looking at Snapchat versus
[01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:30.920]   Periscope or whatever is going to be akin to Facebook
[01:21:30.920 --> 01:21:31.840]   versus Twitter.
[01:21:31.840 --> 01:21:35.680]   One is just bigger and more meaningful generally.
[01:21:35.680 --> 01:21:40.400]   But the reason why Twitter had no choice but to pull
[01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:44.720]   the knives on Meerkat is one thing that Twitter does better
[01:21:44.720 --> 01:21:46.880]   than anyone else and has always been better.
[01:21:46.880 --> 01:21:49.920]   Is the real time stuff when something is happening?
[01:21:49.920 --> 01:21:55.720]   And the issue is that video is infinitely more powerful
[01:21:55.720 --> 01:21:58.000]   than text when it comes to rewaying something happening
[01:21:58.000 --> 01:21:58.880]   real time.
[01:21:58.880 --> 01:22:00.640]   And Twitter has to own that space.
[01:22:00.640 --> 01:22:03.720]   That's a core value of Twitter that Twitter does
[01:22:03.720 --> 01:22:05.240]   that nobody else does.
[01:22:05.240 --> 01:22:09.040]   And Meerkat was very threatening.
[01:22:09.040 --> 01:22:10.880]   Again, not because it's had a ton of users but it could
[01:22:10.880 --> 01:22:14.920]   have the potential to unbundle kind of a core part of that,
[01:22:14.920 --> 01:22:16.920]   of what Twitter is.
[01:22:16.920 --> 01:22:22.040]   And it was very fortuitous or strategic or smart or whatever
[01:22:22.040 --> 01:22:23.400]   adjective you want to use.
[01:22:23.400 --> 01:22:26.560]   That Twitter acquired Periscope when it did and that it was
[01:22:26.560 --> 01:22:28.960]   ready to be released when it did.
[01:22:28.960 --> 01:22:33.720]   And I would expect them to continue to be very aggressive.
[01:22:33.720 --> 01:22:35.160]   Jason, we've lost you, Jason.
[01:22:35.160 --> 01:22:35.600]   He's ready.
[01:22:35.600 --> 01:22:37.320]   I'm trying to come up with jokes in the chat.
[01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:40.720]   I'm trying to imagine all of the McDonough menu items right
[01:22:40.720 --> 01:22:40.920]   now.
[01:22:40.920 --> 01:22:41.920]   I like them.
[01:22:41.920 --> 01:22:44.120]   The best I've got is the extra virgin--
[01:22:44.120 --> 01:22:47.640]   like a virgin olive oil salad dressing.
[01:22:47.640 --> 01:22:50.400]   And I'm trying to do like filet of fish, ray of light kind
[01:22:50.400 --> 01:22:50.400]   of thing.
[01:22:50.400 --> 01:22:51.640]   But I haven't gotten yet.
[01:22:51.640 --> 01:22:52.120]   I'm working on it.
[01:22:52.120 --> 01:22:52.680]   I'm working on it.
[01:22:52.680 --> 01:22:54.240]   I'll let you know.
[01:22:54.240 --> 01:22:57.200]   But Twitter, you were saying.
[01:22:57.200 --> 01:22:59.880]   I think Twitter is such a mixed bag because on the one hand,
[01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:01.120]   it's a cesspool.
[01:23:01.120 --> 01:23:04.400]   And on the other hand, it is really a valuable signaling
[01:23:04.400 --> 01:23:05.560]   mechanism.
[01:23:05.560 --> 01:23:07.200]   When Twitter first came out, somebody--
[01:23:07.200 --> 01:23:08.000]   I don't really understand.
[01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:08.600]   --I don't really understand.
[01:23:08.600 --> 01:23:09.480]   It's signaling sus.
[01:23:09.480 --> 01:23:10.680]   It's signaling, maybe.
[01:23:10.680 --> 01:23:11.680]   It sucks.
[01:23:11.680 --> 01:23:13.960]   Well, but somebody like it did too at dial tone,
[01:23:13.960 --> 01:23:14.960]   and internet dial tone.
[01:23:14.960 --> 01:23:15.960]   I think it's kind of that.
[01:23:15.960 --> 01:23:17.680]   So what makes Twitter great is this asymmetry
[01:23:17.680 --> 01:23:19.640]   where a random person can ask me a question
[01:23:19.640 --> 01:23:20.640]   and I can answer it on Twitter.
[01:23:20.640 --> 01:23:21.480]   And I love that.
[01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:23.520]   The problem is that a random wacko
[01:23:23.520 --> 01:23:25.120]   can say things to me on Twitter too.
[01:23:25.120 --> 01:23:28.480]   And I have to listen to that, at least until I block them.
[01:23:28.480 --> 01:23:31.880]   So it's funny because I love it.
[01:23:31.880 --> 01:23:36.160]   And yet, my friends and I and my colleagues in this industry
[01:23:36.160 --> 01:23:38.120]   are increasingly realizing that there's some stuff
[01:23:38.120 --> 01:23:39.120]   that you've got to keep personal.
[01:23:39.120 --> 01:23:43.560]   And Marco Arment on his accidental tech podcast this week.
[01:23:43.560 --> 01:23:44.760]   They were talking about the same thing.
[01:23:44.760 --> 01:23:46.360]   And I've seen this in other places too.
[01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:49.440]   A lot of the dark social stuff, private social groups, things
[01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:52.760]   like Slack channels, where you retreat because you
[01:23:52.760 --> 01:23:53.600]   know everybody there.
[01:23:53.600 --> 01:23:55.600]   And on one level, it's a real shame
[01:23:55.600 --> 01:23:58.720]   that people who have followings and who like interacting
[01:23:58.720 --> 01:24:01.440]   with people on Twitter have to retreat for some of that stuff
[01:24:01.440 --> 01:24:03.720]   because you're losing interesting conversations
[01:24:03.720 --> 01:24:04.520]   you might have.
[01:24:04.520 --> 01:24:07.840]   At the same time, people are only human beings.
[01:24:07.840 --> 01:24:12.240]   And the toll of dealing with some of the people you end up
[01:24:12.240 --> 01:24:14.800]   dealing with on Twitter becomes so great that you take some
[01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:17.080]   of your stuff and you put it behind the personal shield
[01:24:17.080 --> 01:24:19.360]   and say, I'm just not going to share this with people
[01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:20.360]   I don't know anymore.
[01:24:20.360 --> 01:24:21.960]   And I think that's an issue for Twitter.
[01:24:21.960 --> 01:24:23.480]   - Is that a problem for Twitter?
[01:24:23.480 --> 01:24:25.840]   - I think to a certain degree it is because if you're somebody
[01:24:25.840 --> 01:24:28.400]   who's got 50,000 followers or a million followers
[01:24:28.400 --> 01:24:32.440]   or whatever, you need ways, you either need to be able
[01:24:32.440 --> 01:24:35.280]   to manage what you see or you need to just give up interacting
[01:24:35.280 --> 01:24:36.880]   and become just a broadcaster.
[01:24:36.880 --> 01:24:39.960]   And I would hope that Twitter sees some value in providing tools
[01:24:39.960 --> 01:24:43.960]   for those people to be able to stay in the mix on Twitter
[01:24:43.960 --> 01:24:45.760]   without dealing with the craziness.
[01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:49.000]   I mean, if you're a verified user, I think you get a few more
[01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:52.840]   features in terms of like only seeing, what is it?
[01:24:52.840 --> 01:24:56.280]   Only seeing people you follow into the tailored view
[01:24:56.280 --> 01:24:57.320]   and stuff like that. - I only want to see
[01:24:57.320 --> 01:24:59.720]   other verified users who like Twitter stream.
[01:24:59.720 --> 01:25:02.560]   - You can, because you riffraff are ruining it
[01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:03.560]   from Instagram. - And that seems wrong.
[01:25:03.560 --> 01:25:04.400]   Doesn't it?
[01:25:04.400 --> 01:25:05.960]   I mean, that seems not like a good use of Twitter.
[01:25:05.960 --> 01:25:08.000]   - I could turn it on, but it's like, I don't want to do that.
[01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:09.040]   - Yeah, I agree with you.
[01:25:09.040 --> 01:25:11.840]   But I have seen that this is the downside to Twitter.
[01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:14.160]   So people are, there's that initial flush of like,
[01:25:14.160 --> 01:25:15.400]   I'm going to share everything on Twitter.
[01:25:15.400 --> 01:25:16.920]   I'm going to share my pictures of waffles
[01:25:16.920 --> 01:25:19.320]   and then I'm making, breakfast, I'm making for my kids.
[01:25:19.320 --> 01:25:20.720]   - That's all social media, right?
[01:25:20.720 --> 01:25:23.080]   Don't we go through these phases of putting everything
[01:25:23.080 --> 01:25:25.840]   on Facebook or Instagram too, right?
[01:25:25.840 --> 01:25:28.000]   - Right, and I think we're just at that point now
[01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:33.000]   where Twitter has had enough problems with bad behavior
[01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:36.400]   that people are pulling back a little bit from it,
[01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:39.120]   which is a shame, but I'm with Ben.
[01:25:39.120 --> 01:25:41.960]   I find Twitter indispensable and I wouldn't--
[01:25:41.960 --> 01:25:43.760]   - I keep wanting Twitter ever. - Twitter, ever.
[01:25:43.760 --> 01:25:45.120]   - I can't.
[01:25:45.120 --> 01:25:46.840]   I talk to so many interesting people.
[01:25:46.840 --> 01:25:49.120]   I feel like being accessible to people.
[01:25:49.120 --> 01:25:52.160]   I learn things from all sorts of people I don't know.
[01:25:52.160 --> 01:25:53.880]   - Well, you, during the watch thing,
[01:25:53.880 --> 01:25:55.280]   I was watching you and Glenn Fleischman
[01:25:55.280 --> 01:25:57.600]   and others talking together and it's great.
[01:25:57.600 --> 01:25:59.200]   It's like you're a fly on the wall
[01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:01.120]   to these other people, to these conversations
[01:26:01.120 --> 01:26:03.040]   that are fascinating. - And I think one of the problems
[01:26:03.040 --> 01:26:05.160]   is if you lose sight of the fact
[01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:08.600]   that there are flies on the wall, that's a mistake
[01:26:08.600 --> 01:26:10.200]   because you have to realize you are in public
[01:26:10.200 --> 01:26:12.200]   and you are having a conversation in public.
[01:26:12.200 --> 01:26:13.840]   And if it's a conversation you're not comfortable
[01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:15.600]   having in public, you shouldn't have it in public.
[01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:17.720]   And I think that's just one of those social media lessons
[01:26:17.720 --> 01:26:19.200]   that we all have to keep learning.
[01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:20.960]   But I think Twitter has great value.
[01:26:20.960 --> 01:26:24.560]   I just, I think it's what I use it for has changed over time.
[01:26:24.560 --> 01:26:29.400]   - Yeah, I feel like Twitter, to some degree,
[01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:31.160]   and much more so, "Mirkat" in Periscope
[01:26:31.160 --> 01:26:33.560]   is a very narcissistic medium.
[01:26:33.560 --> 01:26:35.440]   It is a medium for people who are say,
[01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:38.400]   "Watch me look at me like I'm not."
[01:26:38.400 --> 01:26:40.000]   But... (laughs)
[01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:41.840]   - Right, well, I mean-- - I was here first,
[01:26:41.840 --> 01:26:42.960]   gosh darn it.
[01:26:42.960 --> 01:26:45.240]   - I think the problem is that,
[01:26:45.240 --> 01:26:46.760]   do you have something to say or not?
[01:26:46.760 --> 01:26:49.440]   If all you want is for people to watch you,
[01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:50.280]   that's a problem, right? - Well that's a big gap
[01:26:50.280 --> 01:26:52.080]   right there. - Right, but we did
[01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:54.200]   "AmeriKet's Stream" when I was on "Mac Break Weekly"
[01:26:54.200 --> 01:26:55.520]   with you a few weeks ago. - It was fun.
[01:26:55.520 --> 01:26:56.360]   - After the Apple event. - Yeah.
[01:26:56.360 --> 01:26:58.720]   - And it was literally like the after show
[01:26:58.720 --> 01:27:00.000]   behind the scenes. - Yeah.
[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.720]   - And that was actually kind of a lot of fun.
[01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:04.880]   But, for every one of those,
[01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:06.440]   there's one where it's just like,
[01:27:06.440 --> 01:27:08.560]   there's no point in why are you even doing this.
[01:27:08.560 --> 01:27:10.240]   It's a new medium, that's gonna happen when you start.
[01:27:10.240 --> 01:27:11.480]   - Those are all my Periscopes.
[01:27:11.480 --> 01:27:14.040]   I do the most inane stuff on Periscope.
[01:27:14.040 --> 01:27:15.720]   Like I'll literally be walking down the street
[01:27:15.720 --> 01:27:17.560]   in my neighborhood and just streaming everything
[01:27:17.560 --> 01:27:20.520]   and people are like, "On hundreds of people will watch it."
[01:27:20.520 --> 01:27:21.840]   We're in a cab or something.
[01:27:21.840 --> 01:27:22.920]   - That's the whole thing, right?
[01:27:22.920 --> 01:27:25.000]   It's like, "Ooh, hundreds of people are watching me
[01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:25.920]   "walk down the street."
[01:27:25.920 --> 01:27:27.040]   Ooh.
[01:27:27.040 --> 01:27:29.560]   - Yeah, it's pretty cool. - We formed a segue gang
[01:27:29.560 --> 01:27:31.960]   and terrorized Petaluma on Mirkat.
[01:27:31.960 --> 01:27:32.800]   That was fun.
[01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:34.880]   - Six of us have segues.
[01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:38.640]   - I think this criticism of it is misplaced.
[01:27:38.640 --> 01:27:41.840]   I mean, because remember the Christmas
[01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:43.040]   on Twitter at the beginning was,
[01:27:43.040 --> 01:27:45.040]   I don't care if we're waiting for breakfast, right?
[01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:50.040]   It takes a while for the content that resonates
[01:27:50.040 --> 01:27:52.960]   to get figured out and to get out there.
[01:27:52.960 --> 01:27:56.840]   I think that'll be the case for Mirkat and Periscope.
[01:27:56.840 --> 01:27:58.920]   But there's, man, it's incredible.
[01:27:58.920 --> 01:28:00.120]   First time I used it, I think,
[01:28:00.120 --> 01:28:03.440]   actually it was with Jason at the watch event.
[01:28:03.440 --> 01:28:04.280]   - Yeah.
[01:28:04.280 --> 01:28:05.120]   - Oh, yeah.
[01:28:05.120 --> 01:28:10.120]   - It was just the idea that there's hundreds of people
[01:28:10.120 --> 01:28:12.680]   all over the world.
[01:28:12.680 --> 01:28:15.600]   It's incredible.
[01:28:15.600 --> 01:28:18.480]   It's really, there's clearly something there.
[01:28:18.480 --> 01:28:20.840]   It will take time to figure it out
[01:28:20.840 --> 01:28:22.880]   and to kind of distill it.
[01:28:22.880 --> 01:28:27.520]   But no, there's clearly something very, very powerful there.
[01:28:27.520 --> 01:28:28.360]   - Yeah, I found it interesting.
[01:28:28.360 --> 01:28:30.480]   On the launch day of Periscope,
[01:28:30.480 --> 01:28:32.280]   that explosion happened in East Village.
[01:28:32.280 --> 01:28:34.160]   - That was so convenient, huh?
[01:28:34.160 --> 01:28:35.440]   - And right away, people,
[01:28:35.440 --> 01:28:38.000]   I mean, the first thing people did was start Periscoping it,
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:39.800]   not Mirkat, Periscoping it.
[01:28:39.800 --> 01:28:42.720]   And at BI, that's kind of,
[01:28:42.720 --> 01:28:44.160]   we gathered a lot of stuff from there
[01:28:44.160 --> 01:28:47.160]   because people immediately started filming this thing.
[01:28:47.160 --> 01:28:49.600]   It was kind of like when that jet crashed
[01:28:49.600 --> 01:28:52.920]   into the Hudson River, people took to Twitter
[01:28:52.920 --> 01:28:55.400]   and someone said a twit pic or whatever, right away.
[01:28:55.400 --> 01:28:58.280]   And that went up and it became like this defining moment.
[01:28:58.280 --> 01:29:00.040]   I don't know if this is Periscope's defining moment
[01:29:00.040 --> 01:29:01.440]   or something, but it was very interesting
[01:29:01.440 --> 01:29:02.840]   that instead of photos,
[01:29:02.840 --> 01:29:04.720]   we started getting this live streaming video
[01:29:04.720 --> 01:29:06.920]   as these buildings are burning down.
[01:29:06.920 --> 01:29:09.080]   And that was really interesting to me.
[01:29:09.080 --> 01:29:11.280]   - Absolutely.
[01:29:11.280 --> 01:29:12.360]   Apparently, I didn't know this,
[01:29:12.360 --> 01:29:16.800]   but somebody has videotaped the Segway gang
[01:29:16.800 --> 01:29:20.320]   riding around Petaluma and posted on YouTube.
[01:29:20.320 --> 01:29:23.080]   So even on Mirkat, you never know.
[01:29:23.080 --> 01:29:25.200]   You never know what's gonna happen.
[01:29:25.200 --> 01:29:26.280]   That's crazy.
[01:29:26.280 --> 01:29:29.800]   - I love the internet.
[01:29:29.800 --> 01:29:31.640]   - The internet is crazy.
[01:29:31.640 --> 01:29:32.480]   - That's crazy.
[01:29:32.480 --> 01:29:34.880]   Thank you, Pixel Punisher.
[01:29:34.880 --> 01:29:37.300]   Whoever you may be.
[01:29:37.300 --> 01:29:42.520]   Facebook apparently is not dominated by old farts like me,
[01:29:42.520 --> 01:29:45.680]   but in fact, teenagers are still using it.
[01:29:45.680 --> 01:29:50.680]   What a relief that must be to Facebook.
[01:29:50.680 --> 01:29:54.280]   This is an article in Recode by Kurt Wagner.
[01:29:55.120 --> 01:29:58.520]   I always, I felt like Facebook was for your parents, right?
[01:29:58.520 --> 01:29:59.880]   Not my parents, obviously,
[01:29:59.880 --> 01:30:02.920]   but actually my parents aren't on Facebook.
[01:30:02.920 --> 01:30:06.720]   But Facebook was not for the teenagers,
[01:30:06.720 --> 01:30:10.480]   but Pew Research on Thursday released a study
[01:30:10.480 --> 01:30:13.960]   that found that despite a dip in total teen users
[01:30:13.960 --> 01:30:16.000]   from a few years back, Facebook is still in a far
[01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:19.360]   and away the most popular network among teenagers,
[01:30:19.360 --> 01:30:24.080]   71% of teens, 13 to 17, use the service.
[01:30:24.080 --> 01:30:25.880]   - Number one is also Facebook,
[01:30:25.880 --> 01:30:26.880]   or number two is also Facebook.
[01:30:26.880 --> 01:30:27.720]   - Instagram. - Instagram.
[01:30:27.720 --> 01:30:29.760]   That's my daughter's number one is Instagram,
[01:30:29.760 --> 01:30:31.480]   but it's Facebook, still Facebook.
[01:30:31.480 --> 01:30:33.680]   - My kids use Snapchat a lot,
[01:30:33.680 --> 01:30:36.480]   although Abby, who's a little older, likes Instagram,
[01:30:36.480 --> 01:30:38.360]   but both use Facebook to keep in touch.
[01:30:38.360 --> 01:30:41.640]   So if there's an event or when Abby went to LA,
[01:30:41.640 --> 01:30:43.760]   or I guess New York, she went to New York
[01:30:43.760 --> 01:30:45.760]   a couple of weeks during spring break, a couple of weeks ago,
[01:30:45.760 --> 01:30:47.960]   and she, merely all she did was put it on Facebook,
[01:30:47.960 --> 01:30:49.160]   I'm gonna be in New York.
[01:30:49.160 --> 01:30:52.760]   And every night she went out to dinner, she saw friends,
[01:30:52.760 --> 01:30:54.000]   there's a real value to that.
[01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.200]   And I think that's probably why a lot of people still use
[01:30:56.200 --> 01:30:58.760]   Facebook is for that kind of interaction.
[01:30:58.760 --> 01:31:02.600]   - Yeah, this idea that like anyone's gonna only ever
[01:31:02.600 --> 01:31:05.240]   use one social network has been flawed from the beginning.
[01:31:05.240 --> 01:31:09.360]   And the reality is Facebook is so embedded that,
[01:31:09.360 --> 01:31:12.760]   like Facebook is the rolodex of the world.
[01:31:12.760 --> 01:31:17.560]   And it doesn't matter how funny, duddy people think it is
[01:31:17.560 --> 01:31:20.000]   or their parents are like, everyone is going to be on it.
[01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.560]   That's why one of the many reasons why I think
[01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:27.040]   the service is strangely enough, still underrated
[01:31:27.040 --> 01:31:29.800]   by a lot of people in tech in particular.
[01:31:29.800 --> 01:31:32.040]   It's enmeshed in people's lives.
[01:31:32.040 --> 01:31:34.320]   Like every country you look at,
[01:31:34.320 --> 01:31:36.320]   they may have different messaging services
[01:31:36.320 --> 01:31:38.800]   or different things, but it's always and Facebook.
[01:31:38.800 --> 01:31:41.400]   Like the ones that are actually used.
[01:31:41.400 --> 01:31:43.280]   So you're Facebook so much.
[01:31:43.280 --> 01:31:44.880]   - Don't, don't.
[01:31:44.880 --> 01:31:45.880]   - You're stuck with it, sorry.
[01:31:45.880 --> 01:31:46.720]   - I know.
[01:31:46.720 --> 01:31:48.400]   It's another one where,
[01:31:48.400 --> 01:31:49.840]   where they, I guess they have good marketing
[01:31:49.840 --> 01:31:50.680]   and it's objective.
[01:31:50.680 --> 01:31:52.040]   - No, no, no, no, that's not the case.
[01:31:52.040 --> 01:31:55.600]   In fact, Facebook, you have to be there
[01:31:55.600 --> 01:31:57.240]   'cause that's where everybody is, right?
[01:31:57.240 --> 01:31:58.080]   No, exactly.
[01:31:58.080 --> 01:32:00.160]   Facebook's marketing is terrible.
[01:32:00.160 --> 01:32:02.160]   They keep releasing apps that nobody wants.
[01:32:02.160 --> 01:32:03.200]   - Can I say it?
[01:32:03.200 --> 01:32:05.920]   - Yeah, would you see RIF for three seconds?
[01:32:05.920 --> 01:32:08.640]   They put out apps that people use and they go,
[01:32:08.640 --> 01:32:10.120]   what is this, this is terrible?
[01:32:10.120 --> 01:32:12.240]   They can't figure it out and yet they survive
[01:32:12.240 --> 01:32:13.080]   because of the network of--
[01:32:13.080 --> 01:32:14.920]   - But I like their experimentation there, right?
[01:32:14.920 --> 01:32:16.880]   'Cause Instagram is a success and I know it started
[01:32:16.880 --> 01:32:18.560]   on the outside, but the idea that Facebook
[01:32:18.560 --> 01:32:20.640]   can have other apps that have their own ecosystems.
[01:32:20.640 --> 01:32:24.240]   And I think that's, they're so smart.
[01:32:24.240 --> 01:32:29.240]   And in the end, that seems to be the place
[01:32:29.240 --> 01:32:30.600]   that links all the people.
[01:32:30.600 --> 01:32:33.440]   Facebook won't rest until everybody on the planet
[01:32:33.440 --> 01:32:34.600]   is on Facebook, right?
[01:32:34.600 --> 01:32:36.440]   - But I think I'm not alone when I say I hate it
[01:32:36.440 --> 01:32:37.280]   and I use it.
[01:32:37.280 --> 01:32:40.080]   I think that seems pretty universal, right?
[01:32:40.080 --> 01:32:40.920]   Everybody hates it.
[01:32:40.920 --> 01:32:43.440]   - I don't love it, but I can't use it.
[01:32:43.440 --> 01:32:44.520]   - I don't know, I have to use it.
[01:32:44.520 --> 01:32:46.240]   - Do you love Facebook?
[01:32:46.240 --> 01:32:47.440]   - I like it.
[01:32:47.440 --> 01:32:50.200]   And honestly, I would be happy if Twitter
[01:32:50.200 --> 01:32:51.760]   was a lot more like Facebook,
[01:32:51.760 --> 01:32:53.600]   but with the people I follow on Twitter.
[01:32:53.600 --> 01:32:54.800]   But I think the value in Twitter
[01:32:54.800 --> 01:32:57.320]   is not necessarily the 140 character thing.
[01:32:57.320 --> 01:32:59.680]   I think, I'm actually gonna write about Twitter this week.
[01:32:59.680 --> 01:33:00.600]   I'm gonna cover all this stuff.
[01:33:00.600 --> 01:33:01.760]   So everyone's gonna preview.
[01:33:01.760 --> 01:33:06.760]   But the value in Twitter is the people that are on Twitter
[01:33:06.760 --> 01:33:09.600]   and the people that I'm connected with.
[01:33:09.600 --> 01:33:11.200]   And quite frankly, the fact that people
[01:33:11.200 --> 01:33:12.320]   are still doing all these hacks,
[01:33:12.320 --> 01:33:14.960]   like now the screen, the pasting screenshot thing, right?
[01:33:14.960 --> 01:33:17.200]   - Oh my God, 'cause they got 140 characters.
[01:33:17.200 --> 01:33:19.760]   So they pasted their conversation.
[01:33:19.760 --> 01:33:22.080]   - The fact that you can't have a real conversation
[01:33:22.080 --> 01:33:25.360]   on Twitter because all these people get clogged into it
[01:33:25.360 --> 01:33:27.000]   and at reply and you end up having like
[01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.800]   these three word responses, it's ridiculous.
[01:33:29.800 --> 01:33:32.360]   I mean, and this is kind of the big concern
[01:33:32.360 --> 01:33:35.880]   with the company pulling in more and more feet,
[01:33:35.880 --> 01:33:37.680]   like parts of the search into itself
[01:33:37.680 --> 01:33:40.040]   is the company has really yet to demonstrate
[01:33:40.040 --> 01:33:43.200]   any capability of evolving the product
[01:33:43.200 --> 01:33:45.200]   in a meaningful way to be perfectly frank.
[01:33:45.200 --> 01:33:48.600]   I would love to have the Facebook feature set,
[01:33:48.600 --> 01:33:51.880]   but with Twitter people and Twitter is miles away from that.
[01:33:51.880 --> 01:33:55.160]   I mean, even like Cina Wiebel, the Chinese one,
[01:33:55.160 --> 01:33:56.280]   which was kind of big for a while
[01:33:56.280 --> 01:33:58.880]   and it's really gotten destroyed by WeChat,
[01:33:58.880 --> 01:34:02.280]   but they've had a conversation threaded type view
[01:34:02.280 --> 01:34:04.480]   within a Twitter type user experience
[01:34:04.480 --> 01:34:05.520]   for a long time now.
[01:34:05.520 --> 01:34:10.520]   And it's Twitter, like I guess the depth of your love
[01:34:10.520 --> 01:34:13.760]   for a company will be reflected or love for a product
[01:34:13.760 --> 01:34:15.400]   and will be reflecting your frustration at it,
[01:34:15.400 --> 01:34:16.240]   not being better.
[01:34:16.240 --> 01:34:17.080]   - Yeah. - That's certainly
[01:34:17.080 --> 01:34:17.920]   the case for me in Twitter.
[01:34:17.920 --> 01:34:18.760]   - Yep.
[01:34:18.760 --> 01:34:23.880]   All right, I want to take a break.
[01:34:23.880 --> 01:34:24.880]   We have lots more to talk about.
[01:34:24.880 --> 01:34:26.640]   I just put that, I have to get a plane.
[01:34:26.640 --> 01:34:30.080]   I'm going to Vegas tonight for the NAB Show,
[01:34:30.080 --> 01:34:31.600]   National Association of Broadcasters
[01:34:31.600 --> 01:34:35.640]   and we're doing a panel if you're in Vegas for NAB
[01:34:35.640 --> 01:34:36.560]   called Broadcast.
[01:34:36.560 --> 01:34:38.080]   Minds, I've done this a couple of times before
[01:34:38.080 --> 01:34:40.880]   with our friends from New Tech who do that tricaster
[01:34:40.880 --> 01:34:41.960]   we're so dependent on.
[01:34:41.960 --> 01:34:44.680]   I'm gonna moderate a panel.
[01:34:44.680 --> 01:34:45.720]   I think it's open to the public.
[01:34:45.720 --> 01:34:50.200]   It's, well, actually, I guess it's open to the NAB Show attendees.
[01:34:50.200 --> 01:34:53.760]   But Scobel's gonna join me.
[01:34:53.760 --> 01:34:57.040]   Also, and I'm really interested to talk about
[01:34:57.040 --> 01:35:03.360]   what's going on now in streaming and digital with,
[01:35:03.360 --> 01:35:08.160]   oh, God, I can find the names here, wait a minute.
[01:35:08.160 --> 01:35:09.640]   - Well, you mentioned the 10 year thing,
[01:35:09.640 --> 01:35:13.120]   I think we went like that's spectacular.
[01:35:13.120 --> 01:35:14.040]   Isn't that amazing?
[01:35:14.040 --> 01:35:16.920]   - Yes, congratulations. - Geez, Louise.
[01:35:16.920 --> 01:35:18.400]   I'm the old man of this stuff.
[01:35:18.400 --> 01:35:20.040]   - Well, not just that, but you talk about the idea
[01:35:20.040 --> 01:35:21.480]   that we're at the front end of a periscope,
[01:35:21.480 --> 01:35:22.520]   we're gonna see how it develops, right?
[01:35:22.520 --> 01:35:24.480]   We're at the front end of a wash and see how it develops.
[01:35:24.480 --> 01:35:28.280]   And I think, right now, there's like the deluge of podcasting
[01:35:28.280 --> 01:35:29.360]   is the big thing.
[01:35:29.360 --> 01:35:32.880]   And when the history of podcasting is written,
[01:35:32.880 --> 01:35:33.720]   your name's gonna be on it.
[01:35:33.720 --> 01:35:34.800]   And that's pretty cool.
[01:35:34.800 --> 01:35:35.640]   So.
[01:35:35.640 --> 01:35:36.480]   - Yeah, my gravestone.
[01:35:36.480 --> 01:35:40.040]   - I mentioned it as a compliment.
[01:35:40.040 --> 01:35:40.880]   - Thank you.
[01:35:40.880 --> 01:35:41.720]   - Sounds cool.
[01:35:41.720 --> 01:35:42.920]   - He died as he lived.
[01:35:42.920 --> 01:35:45.200]   - We love the microphone. - Being on the internet.
[01:35:45.200 --> 01:35:48.840]   - S222, a South Hall, Monday, 5 p.m.,
[01:35:48.840 --> 01:35:52.560]   Skobel me, Mark DeBovois, who's the EVP and GM
[01:35:52.560 --> 01:35:55.240]   for entertainment news and sports at CBS Interactive.
[01:35:55.240 --> 01:35:58.280]   They've got some really interesting digital aspirations.
[01:35:58.280 --> 01:36:00.760]   And from vice media, their head of digital strategy,
[01:36:00.760 --> 01:36:02.600]   Sterling Crawford, they just signed a deal with HBO
[01:36:02.600 --> 01:36:05.000]   to do its nightly news cast.
[01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:08.120]   So there's some interesting stuff happening in this space.
[01:36:08.120 --> 01:36:09.440]   That's what's fun about doing it.
[01:36:09.440 --> 01:36:12.680]   Doing it for 10 years, I've watched it change.
[01:36:12.680 --> 01:36:16.840]   And I keep waiting for ITP, IPTV and over the top.
[01:36:16.840 --> 01:36:18.400]   And I keep waiting for that to happen.
[01:36:18.400 --> 01:36:19.960]   I think we're getting closer and closer.
[01:36:19.960 --> 01:36:22.600]   That's when this is all gonna blow up.
[01:36:22.600 --> 01:36:23.440]   I'm just...
[01:36:23.440 --> 01:36:24.520]   - This is gonna be a big year for that.
[01:36:24.520 --> 01:36:25.360]   - How do you think so?
[01:36:25.360 --> 01:36:26.200]   This is gonna be the year?
[01:36:26.200 --> 01:36:27.080]   - Oh yeah.
[01:36:27.080 --> 01:36:31.080]   Well, a monumental step towards that vision.
[01:36:31.080 --> 01:36:33.720]   - HBO now, Sling TV, we're starting to see.
[01:36:33.720 --> 01:36:35.240]   - The damn ass doing it.
[01:36:35.240 --> 01:36:36.080]   - Yeah.
[01:36:36.080 --> 01:36:37.080]   - If the damn hasn't burst, it's got cracks.
[01:36:37.080 --> 01:36:38.960]   - It's about to, yeah.
[01:36:38.960 --> 01:36:40.880]   - Hey, I showed it, I brought to you by Stamps.com.
[01:36:40.880 --> 01:36:43.360]   Use Stamps.com to do your own postage thing,

[01:36:48.120 --> 01:36:51.400]   Oh no, no, oh no, it's so much more than that.
[01:36:51.400 --> 01:36:53.840]   Yes, you can buy in print official US postage,
[01:36:53.840 --> 01:36:55.880]   right from your computer with your printer,

[01:37:01.800 --> 01:37:03.520]   about shipping.
[01:37:03.520 --> 01:37:06.200]   It can give your small business a more professional look.
[01:37:06.200 --> 01:37:10.320]   I can't tell you how often I get eBay or Etsy packages.
[01:37:10.320 --> 01:37:12.760]   They look like a monkey wrapped them.
[01:37:12.760 --> 01:37:15.160]   And they, you know, like a hundred stamps on there
[01:37:15.160 --> 01:37:18.440]   and it's, the address is drawn in crayon.
[01:37:18.440 --> 01:37:21.560]   It doesn't take anything to do with Stamps.com.

[01:37:41.680 --> 01:37:44.440]   'cause of the great digital scale you get.
[01:37:44.440 --> 01:37:45.480]   It's so much better.
[01:37:45.480 --> 01:37:46.600]   You can print directly on envelopes
[01:37:46.600 --> 01:37:48.400]   with your company's logo.
[01:37:48.400 --> 01:37:51.960]   It is professional, it is the way to do it.
[01:37:51.960 --> 01:37:54.880]   For shipping labels, you can put your logo on it too.
[01:37:54.880 --> 01:37:56.240]   You also get discounts, you don't get it,
[01:37:56.240 --> 01:37:57.680]   the post office.
[01:37:57.680 --> 01:38:01.680]   On certified mail, you can,
[01:38:01.680 --> 01:38:04.720]   if you're sending stuff out with confirmations,
[01:38:04.720 --> 01:38:06.520]   you can send an email along with it saying,

[01:38:17.220 --> 01:38:20.920]   The postage rates are always kept up to date,
[01:38:20.920 --> 01:38:21.760]   it's just great.
[01:38:21.760 --> 01:38:24.680]   Stamps.com, do everything you do at the post office
[01:38:24.680 --> 01:38:27.320]   and then just hand the package to your mail carrier

[01:38:28.960 --> 01:38:30.960]   You can, there's even a button on the Stamps.com site
[01:38:30.960 --> 01:38:33.240]   that says, get the mail carrier out here.
[01:38:33.240 --> 01:38:34.920]   No wonder half a million small businesses,

[01:39:09.640 --> 01:39:13.200]   We mentioned that Hillary Clinton announced her run
[01:39:13.200 --> 01:39:15.920]   for president in 2016 on Twitter and on YouTube,
[01:39:15.920 --> 01:39:20.040]   she's also hired a long time well respected Google executive
[01:39:20.040 --> 01:39:25.040]   to oversee her campaign, the CTO, Stephanie Hannon,
[01:39:25.040 --> 01:39:27.640]   formerly Google's director of product management
[01:39:27.640 --> 01:39:30.040]   for civic innovation and social impact
[01:39:30.040 --> 01:39:32.360]   will become the chief technology officer
[01:39:32.360 --> 01:39:35.880]   of the Clinton campaign,
[01:39:35.880 --> 01:39:38.440]   according to Democrats who are in the no.
[01:39:38.440 --> 01:39:42.080]   She'll be the first woman to hold the title of CTO
[01:39:42.080 --> 01:39:43.800]   and a major presidential campaign.
[01:39:43.800 --> 01:39:47.440]   So digital is gonna be so important
[01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:49.120]   in the next 18 months.
[01:39:49.120 --> 01:39:55.760]   I feel like critical to any campaign
[01:39:55.760 --> 01:39:56.920]   and critical to work in the month.
[01:39:56.920 --> 01:39:58.640]   - Something Bitcoin like Rand Paul.
[01:39:58.640 --> 01:39:59.520]   - Isn't that funny?
[01:39:59.520 --> 01:40:00.520]   I love that.
[01:40:00.520 --> 01:40:01.440]   - That cracked me up.
[01:40:01.440 --> 01:40:02.880]   I love that he's accepting Bitcoin.
[01:40:02.880 --> 01:40:05.240]   - Yeah, he'll take anything.
[01:40:05.240 --> 01:40:06.160]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:40:06.160 --> 01:40:11.960]   - The Russians hacked the White House.
[01:40:11.960 --> 01:40:12.800]   See that?
[01:40:12.800 --> 01:40:16.000]   - They do turn on the lights.
[01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:20.320]   - No, they got into the garage door.
[01:40:20.320 --> 01:40:22.680]   - They got into the state department,
[01:40:22.680 --> 01:40:24.400]   then got into sensitive parts of the White House
[01:40:24.400 --> 01:40:27.400]   and the computer system, according to US officials,
[01:40:27.400 --> 01:40:28.760]   the White House has said the breach
[01:40:28.760 --> 01:40:31.480]   only affected an unclassified system.
[01:40:31.480 --> 01:40:34.360]   However, the hackers, according to CNN,
[01:40:34.360 --> 01:40:38.040]   did have access to things like the non-public
[01:40:38.040 --> 01:40:39.560]   presidential schedule.
[01:40:39.560 --> 01:40:43.200]   - They can make them few dates.
[01:40:43.200 --> 01:40:46.560]   I don't know if they had read write access.
[01:40:46.560 --> 01:40:50.080]   The White House said in October,
[01:40:50.080 --> 01:40:52.880]   it noticed suspicious activity in the network.
[01:40:52.880 --> 01:40:55.320]   The system has been shut down to allow for security,
[01:40:55.320 --> 01:40:57.560]   upgrades, the FBI Secret Service
[01:40:57.560 --> 01:40:59.960]   and US intelligence agencies are all involved
[01:40:59.960 --> 01:41:01.600]   in investigating the breach.
[01:41:01.600 --> 01:41:04.280]   They say it's among the most sophisticated attacks
[01:41:04.280 --> 01:41:07.600]   ever launched against US government systems
[01:41:07.600 --> 01:41:10.920]   and they think it came from Russia.
[01:41:10.920 --> 01:41:19.840]   - Yeah, the US government track record is a four,
[01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:22.440]   I'm being on the forefront of technology
[01:41:22.440 --> 01:41:26.200]   outside of, I guess, the NSA collecting information.
[01:41:26.200 --> 01:41:27.120]   All the stories you hear,
[01:41:27.120 --> 01:41:29.360]   this is, all the stories about Hillary Clinton's email
[01:41:29.360 --> 01:41:30.920]   being on her personal email.
[01:41:30.920 --> 01:41:31.760]   - Now you know why.
[01:41:31.760 --> 01:41:32.920]   - It's a similar sort of thing,
[01:41:32.920 --> 01:41:35.840]   which is you start to think about other countries
[01:41:35.840 --> 01:41:39.280]   making great efforts to invade computer systems
[01:41:39.280 --> 01:41:43.000]   and you wonder who is trying to prevent that
[01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.640]   and I think it's not a good story.
[01:41:47.560 --> 01:41:51.600]   - I feel like the cyber war is gonna just explode, don't you?
[01:41:51.600 --> 01:41:52.440]   - Yeah.
[01:41:52.440 --> 01:41:55.520]   - It's just taken off, it's just begun.
[01:41:55.520 --> 01:41:59.920]   - It's scary because you can tell when people are shooting
[01:41:59.920 --> 01:42:02.400]   but a lot of this stuff happens and it's invisible.
[01:42:02.400 --> 01:42:03.640]   - Right.
[01:42:03.640 --> 01:42:06.440]   It was funny how every attack is the most sophisticated
[01:42:06.440 --> 01:42:07.560]   scene. - I know.
[01:42:07.560 --> 01:42:08.400]   - That's kind of saying,
[01:42:08.400 --> 01:42:11.200]   "Hey, it's not our fault, these guys are really good."
[01:42:11.200 --> 01:42:12.520]   - Right, in the same paragraph where they're saying
[01:42:12.520 --> 01:42:15.160]   they're shutting the whole thing down to update security.
[01:42:15.160 --> 01:42:19.160]   Like that suggests that it might not have been as secure
[01:42:19.160 --> 01:42:21.720]   as it could have been to start out with,
[01:42:21.720 --> 01:42:25.480]   which perhaps it wasn't the most sophisticated attack ever.
[01:42:25.480 --> 01:42:29.400]   There's a bit of a disconnect.
[01:42:29.400 --> 01:42:30.760]   The presidential is private schedule.
[01:42:30.760 --> 01:42:34.920]   I mean, that's a pretty bad thing to have available.
[01:42:34.920 --> 01:42:38.920]   So I think it is a pretty severe breach.
[01:42:38.920 --> 01:42:42.280]   I just, I questioned the level of sophistication
[01:42:42.280 --> 01:42:43.800]   relative to the level of security.
[01:42:43.800 --> 01:42:46.120]   I'm sure it was sophisticated, but I mean,
[01:42:46.120 --> 01:42:50.840]   if the rest of the excerpt doesn't suggest
[01:42:50.840 --> 01:42:52.440]   it was as secure as it could be.
[01:42:52.440 --> 01:42:55.560]   - Well, of course now the head of the National Security Agency
[01:42:55.560 --> 01:42:58.040]   Admiral Michael S. Rogers is saying,
[01:42:58.040 --> 01:43:00.560]   we'd like a key to all those private transactions
[01:43:00.560 --> 01:43:02.760]   you guys are involved in.
[01:43:02.760 --> 01:43:04.960]   They're going for something called Key escrow.
[01:43:04.960 --> 01:43:08.520]   They want to require technology companies
[01:43:08.520 --> 01:43:12.080]   to create a digital key that could unlock any smartphone
[01:43:12.080 --> 01:43:15.200]   or other locked device to obtain text messages or photos.
[01:43:15.200 --> 01:43:18.560]   But no one agency would have the whole key.
[01:43:18.560 --> 01:43:21.360]   So you'd have to go to the FBI, CIA, and the NSA
[01:43:21.360 --> 01:43:24.320]   to get the whole key, I guess.
[01:43:24.320 --> 01:43:25.160]   - That's the idea.
[01:43:25.160 --> 01:43:26.000]   - That's the private schedule, right?
[01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:26.840]   - Yeah.
[01:43:26.840 --> 01:43:27.840]   - I mean, like, that's the issue.
[01:43:27.840 --> 01:43:32.840]   I mean, you can create a key that cannot be hacked.
[01:43:32.840 --> 01:43:39.640]   It is, but the issue is that the key has to exist somewhere.
[01:43:39.640 --> 01:43:43.080]   And if they can't secure the president's private schedule,
[01:43:43.080 --> 01:43:46.320]   how can they secure this key?
[01:43:46.320 --> 01:43:47.920]   And once it's out there,
[01:43:47.920 --> 01:43:49.880]   I mean, everyone's going to want to get a hold of it, right?
[01:43:49.880 --> 01:43:52.560]   Like, yeah, maybe if it stayed on like one guy's computer
[01:43:52.560 --> 01:43:56.400]   in Wyoming, but yeah, it's unrealistic.
[01:43:56.400 --> 01:43:59.680]   And I think the fundamental issue of security is the US
[01:43:59.680 --> 01:44:03.640]   as a government, as an institution,
[01:44:03.640 --> 01:44:06.000]   views, I think, security too much
[01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:07.800]   from an offensive perspective,
[01:44:07.800 --> 01:44:10.920]   how they can use it to attack other countries
[01:44:10.920 --> 01:44:12.400]   or get influence with the countries.
[01:44:12.400 --> 01:44:14.080]   And probably something like Stuxnet,
[01:44:14.080 --> 01:44:17.920]   where they disrupted the Iranian centrifuges was,
[01:44:17.920 --> 01:44:25.040]   I mean, it was a problem in that I think now the US looks
[01:44:25.040 --> 01:44:28.640]   at these issues as how can they leverage it
[01:44:28.640 --> 01:44:32.080]   from an offensive perspective without, I think,
[01:44:32.080 --> 01:44:36.720]   a deep appreciation or focus on the defensive angles of it.
[01:44:36.720 --> 01:44:39.640]   And you view this with this key thing,
[01:44:39.640 --> 01:44:42.640]   like the more you make it easier for the NSA to break in,
[01:44:42.640 --> 01:44:45.360]   the easier it is for it to come back the other way.
[01:44:45.360 --> 01:44:46.640]   Like, this is a two-way street,
[01:44:46.640 --> 01:44:49.320]   like there's no one way when it comes to security.
[01:44:49.320 --> 01:44:53.120]   And yeah, it's certainly very concerning.
[01:44:53.120 --> 01:44:58.120]   And unfortunately, I mean, it's gonna have massive impacts
[01:44:58.120 --> 01:45:00.880]   which don't know what they are and what direction.
[01:45:00.880 --> 01:45:03.520]   Apparently, Apple's decision to fully encrypt the iPhone
[01:45:03.520 --> 01:45:06.320]   was really kind of a catalyst for some real concern
[01:45:06.320 --> 01:45:07.960]   among law enforcement.
[01:45:07.960 --> 01:45:11.480]   The Android now in 5.0 can do this as well.
[01:45:11.480 --> 01:45:14.560]   Of course, desktop operating systems have their own
[01:45:14.560 --> 01:45:15.880]   proprietary encryption.
[01:45:15.880 --> 01:45:17.440]   We don't know if there's a backdoor to that.
[01:45:17.440 --> 01:45:19.120]   The White House is also considering,
[01:45:19.120 --> 01:45:20.440]   here's another option.
[01:45:20.440 --> 01:45:24.080]   Why don't we have a third party hold the key?
[01:45:24.080 --> 01:45:26.340]   (laughing)
[01:45:26.340 --> 01:45:29.520]   - Is that third party in the cave somewhere?
[01:45:29.520 --> 01:45:31.280]   - And the key is on paper.
[01:45:31.280 --> 01:45:33.320]   - One pos, this is a Washington Post.
[01:45:33.320 --> 01:45:34.440]   One possibility, for example,
[01:45:34.440 --> 01:45:36.640]   might have a judge direct a company
[01:45:36.640 --> 01:45:38.320]   to set up a mirror account
[01:45:38.320 --> 01:45:40.520]   so that law enforcement conducting a criminal investigation
[01:45:40.520 --> 01:45:43.480]   can read text messages shortly after they've been sent.
[01:45:43.480 --> 01:45:45.640]   For encrypted photos, the judge might order the company
[01:45:45.640 --> 01:45:47.640]   to back up the suspect's data
[01:45:47.640 --> 01:45:49.520]   to a company server when the phone is on
[01:45:49.520 --> 01:45:51.520]   and the data is unencrypted.
[01:45:51.520 --> 01:45:53.800]   And then if they'd have to get a warrant
[01:45:53.800 --> 01:45:55.360]   and they could go look at it,
[01:45:55.360 --> 01:45:57.520]   no tech company in the United States
[01:45:57.520 --> 01:45:58.760]   is gonna agree to something like this.
[01:45:58.760 --> 01:46:01.440]   They'll have to be forced to do this.
[01:46:01.440 --> 01:46:05.160]   - It's already hurting US tech companies internationally.
[01:46:05.160 --> 01:46:07.880]   - Well, absolutely.
[01:46:07.880 --> 01:46:11.880]   I mean, you mentioned the iPhone being a catalyst for this.
[01:46:11.880 --> 01:46:16.200]   I mean, one wishes that the iPhone
[01:46:16.200 --> 01:46:17.600]   putting on this full,
[01:46:17.600 --> 01:46:19.680]   this compression would be an inspiration
[01:46:19.680 --> 01:46:22.120]   for having--
[01:46:22.120 --> 01:46:23.440]   - Well, West for Google, they said, yeah,
[01:46:23.440 --> 01:46:24.920]   we can do that too.
[01:46:24.920 --> 01:46:26.040]   - Right, no, yeah.
[01:46:26.040 --> 01:46:27.400]   - For law enforcement, I mean--
[01:46:27.400 --> 01:46:28.240]   - For a long, long, long perspective.
[01:46:28.240 --> 01:46:30.840]   - And the reality is, no, this is hugely damaging
[01:46:30.840 --> 01:46:33.880]   to the US tech companies abroad.
[01:46:33.880 --> 01:46:38.880]   Like it, and we're only starting to see the impact now
[01:46:38.880 --> 01:46:41.080]   of like the stone revelations and that sort of thing
[01:46:41.080 --> 01:46:42.560]   because it takes companies,
[01:46:42.560 --> 01:46:46.720]   it takes other countries time to build up alternatives.
[01:46:46.720 --> 01:46:47.800]   But in the long run,
[01:46:47.800 --> 01:46:49.560]   this has absolutely hurt US companies.
[01:46:49.560 --> 01:46:50.400]   - Yeah.
[01:46:50.400 --> 01:46:51.880]   - It will continue to hurt US companies.
[01:46:51.880 --> 01:46:56.080]   And the issue isn't necessarily like China per se
[01:46:56.080 --> 01:46:59.360]   'cause the reality is China was already on a path
[01:46:59.360 --> 01:47:03.440]   to kind of wean itself off of US technology
[01:47:03.440 --> 01:47:04.680]   and they've had that project for a while.
[01:47:04.680 --> 01:47:06.040]   I think it accelerated it.
[01:47:06.040 --> 01:47:08.960]   But the issue is all these other countries in the world
[01:47:08.960 --> 01:47:12.720]   where now, once the Chinese finish building up
[01:47:12.720 --> 01:47:16.240]   their alternatives, they're gonna go to them
[01:47:16.240 --> 01:47:18.960]   and there's gonna be an alternative
[01:47:18.960 --> 01:47:23.640]   and the US should have no expectation
[01:47:23.640 --> 01:47:26.280]   of being able to hold out like we're better.
[01:47:26.280 --> 01:47:28.760]   Or like, I mean, there was a big Bruha,
[01:47:28.760 --> 01:47:32.040]   a Hohai in their routers and basically Congress,
[01:47:32.040 --> 01:47:34.280]   basically banning them for all kinds of purposes
[01:47:34.280 --> 01:47:36.800]   from the US because the Chinese might spy on them.
[01:47:36.800 --> 01:47:38.480]   Like that's exactly what the US does.
[01:47:38.480 --> 01:47:39.800]   - We want it there.
[01:47:39.800 --> 01:47:40.800]   - Yeah, the idea that like,
[01:47:40.800 --> 01:47:41.640]   - That's our thing.
[01:47:41.640 --> 01:47:43.040]   - Yeah, the idea that's the important thing.
[01:47:43.040 --> 01:47:43.880]   - We do that thing.
[01:47:43.880 --> 01:47:45.680]   - Like, oh, it's okay if we spy on you,
[01:47:45.680 --> 01:47:47.160]   but they're gonna spy on you too.
[01:47:47.160 --> 01:47:50.720]   Like, no, it's such a ethnocentric
[01:47:50.720 --> 01:47:52.400]   or what word for it,
[01:47:52.400 --> 01:47:54.800]   ridiculous self-centered viewpoint.
[01:47:54.800 --> 01:47:58.800]   - I'm annoyed at a lot of stuff today, apparently.
[01:47:58.800 --> 01:48:00.200]   It's gonna be one of those.
[01:48:00.200 --> 01:48:01.360]   - You mentioned the Washington Post.
[01:48:01.360 --> 01:48:03.480]   This is essentially an updated version of that editorial
[01:48:03.480 --> 01:48:04.680]   that they did back in October.
[01:48:04.680 --> 01:48:05.520]   - Yeah, remember that?
[01:48:05.520 --> 01:48:06.360]   - Yeah.
[01:48:06.360 --> 01:48:08.280]   - They said the secure golden key that the wizards,
[01:48:08.280 --> 01:48:10.600]   the wizards, Apple and Google can invent
[01:48:10.600 --> 01:48:11.840]   that will change cryptography
[01:48:11.840 --> 01:48:14.080]   and allow all these magical things to happen.
[01:48:14.080 --> 01:48:16.480]   And it's like they're just looking for a solution
[01:48:16.480 --> 01:48:18.160]   because they don't want to admit that,
[01:48:18.160 --> 01:48:19.320]   you know, you need to choose.
[01:48:19.320 --> 01:48:20.160]   - It's tough though.
[01:48:20.160 --> 01:48:21.360]   I mean, Obama even self has said,
[01:48:21.360 --> 01:48:22.880]   look, I believe in privacy and encryption.
[01:48:22.880 --> 01:48:24.480]   I think everybody should have the right to it.
[01:48:24.480 --> 01:48:27.560]   But I also understand I'm sympathetic to law enforcement
[01:48:27.560 --> 01:48:30.880]   that says, but then people can do bad stuff
[01:48:30.880 --> 01:48:31.880]   and we wouldn't know about it.
[01:48:31.880 --> 01:48:32.960]   - But the fact is law enforcement,
[01:48:32.960 --> 01:48:35.200]   when the Miranda decision was handed down.
[01:48:35.200 --> 01:48:36.040]   - They didn't like that either.
[01:48:36.040 --> 01:48:37.200]   - They couldn't do their job
[01:48:37.200 --> 01:48:38.360]   if they read people their rights.
[01:48:38.360 --> 01:48:41.040]   And, you know, the fact is law enforcement will find a way,
[01:48:41.040 --> 01:48:43.160]   but once you give that privacy away,
[01:48:43.160 --> 01:48:44.160]   you're never gonna get it back.
[01:48:44.160 --> 01:48:45.000]   - I agree.
[01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:46.840]   We're gonna take a break,
[01:48:46.840 --> 01:48:47.960]   come back with our final thoughts.
[01:48:47.960 --> 01:48:50.760]   In just a second, Steve Kovac is here
[01:48:50.760 --> 01:48:52.520]   from Business Insider, great to have you.
[01:48:52.520 --> 01:48:53.600]   You've moved back to New York.
[01:48:53.600 --> 01:48:55.920]   - There, it looks like you're in Brooklyn with the bricks.
[01:48:55.920 --> 01:48:57.520]   - No, no, I'm in the upreast side.
[01:48:57.520 --> 01:48:59.160]   - Oh, nice.
[01:48:59.160 --> 01:49:00.760]   - They do expose brick up here too.
[01:49:00.760 --> 01:49:01.800]   - Oh, okay, just checking.
[01:49:01.800 --> 01:49:03.240]   - Yeah.
[01:49:03.240 --> 01:49:05.120]   - Can you get pizza up there?
[01:49:05.120 --> 01:49:06.280]   - Oh, pretty good pizza.
[01:49:06.280 --> 01:49:07.720]   A lot better than San Francisco pizza.
[01:49:07.720 --> 01:49:09.080]   - Oh, I know, isn't that sad?
[01:49:09.080 --> 01:49:10.440]   - So you're happy you got our west coast
[01:49:10.440 --> 01:49:11.280]   as terrible as you do.
[01:49:11.280 --> 01:49:12.120]   - Oh, it's terrible.
[01:49:12.120 --> 01:49:13.360]   - You happy you went back?
[01:49:13.360 --> 01:49:14.280]   - Oh, so happy.
[01:49:14.280 --> 01:49:15.360]   I missed the burritos though.
[01:49:15.360 --> 01:49:16.560]   You guys have the best burritos.
[01:49:16.560 --> 01:49:17.480]   - We got the burritos.
[01:49:17.480 --> 01:49:18.320]   You got the pizza.
[01:49:18.320 --> 01:49:19.160]   - Oh, man.
[01:49:19.160 --> 01:49:20.680]   - Seems like in this great country of ours,
[01:49:20.680 --> 01:49:22.600]   we could solve that problem.
[01:49:22.600 --> 01:49:23.600]   I don't know how.
[01:49:23.600 --> 01:49:24.440]   - Jase's now in Sierra.
[01:49:24.440 --> 01:49:25.280]   - It works Chipotle.
[01:49:25.280 --> 01:49:26.120]   - Chipotle.
[01:49:26.120 --> 01:49:27.600]   - It does not have a solution.
[01:49:27.600 --> 01:49:29.920]   - It's definitely not a solution.
[01:49:29.920 --> 01:49:32.120]   - McDonough is the solution.
[01:49:32.120 --> 01:49:33.880]   Jase's now is here also from six,
[01:49:33.880 --> 01:49:36.320]   I haven't given you a plug, sixcolors.com.
[01:49:36.320 --> 01:49:37.160]   - Thank you.
[01:49:37.160 --> 01:49:38.640]   - The incomparable podcast too, and you do great stuff.
[01:49:38.640 --> 01:49:40.760]   - I got a couple of tech podcasts on Relay FM.
[01:49:40.760 --> 01:49:41.600]   People should check out.
[01:49:41.600 --> 01:49:42.440]   - What's Relay FM?
[01:49:42.440 --> 01:49:45.240]   - That's Mike Hurley and Steven Hackett's
[01:49:45.240 --> 01:49:46.600]   tech podcast network.
[01:49:46.600 --> 01:49:47.720]   - Oh, that's neat.
[01:49:47.720 --> 01:49:48.880]   - Yeah, yeah, so I got a--
[01:49:48.880 --> 01:49:50.920]   - We work good enough for you, huh?
[01:49:50.920 --> 01:49:52.880]   - Well, you know, you guys, I'm a little intimidated
[01:49:52.880 --> 01:49:54.480]   by this studio and all of that.
[01:49:54.480 --> 01:49:56.160]   Also, I can do that in my, I can do those shows
[01:49:56.160 --> 01:49:58.080]   in my pajamas from home from my office, yeah.
[01:49:58.080 --> 01:49:58.920]   - There's something about audio.
[01:49:58.920 --> 01:50:00.640]   It's so much easier with the video.
[01:50:00.640 --> 01:50:02.560]   Well, actually, it's some good news for podcasts.
[01:50:02.560 --> 01:50:03.880]   There's a lot about that in just a second.
[01:50:03.880 --> 01:50:05.760]   Also here with us from Stretecory,

[01:50:54.600 --> 01:50:57.880]   most simple platform for your next webpage.
[01:50:57.880 --> 01:50:59.000]   I was really proud of my daughter
[01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:00.680]   and her friend are creating a new site.
[01:51:00.680 --> 01:51:03.120]   And I told them all about the free stuff and so forth,
[01:51:03.120 --> 01:51:05.520]   and they chose any input on my part.
[01:51:05.520 --> 01:51:07.000]   They chose Squarespace.
[01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:08.040]   Because when you do your research,
[01:51:08.040 --> 01:51:10.080]   you realize what you get with Squarespace.

[01:51:22.720 --> 01:51:25.080]   All the Squarespace sites are responsive.
[01:51:25.080 --> 01:51:26.440]   There's McDonald's.
[01:51:26.440 --> 01:51:31.440]   That means it's like a Virgin olive oil.
[01:51:31.440 --> 01:51:34.200]   That means that they scale to look great
[01:51:34.200 --> 01:51:36.480]   on any size device.
[01:51:36.480 --> 01:51:38.520]   E-commerce with every single template,
[01:51:38.520 --> 01:51:40.360]   every website comes with a free online store.
[01:51:40.360 --> 01:51:41.960]   And with cover pages,
[01:51:41.960 --> 01:51:44.360]   you could set up a beautiful one-page online presence
[01:51:44.360 --> 01:51:45.200]   in minutes.
[01:51:45.200 --> 01:51:46.040]   I love Squarespace.

[01:51:49.520 --> 01:51:51.160]   or you want to think about it,
[01:51:51.160 --> 01:51:54.600]   Squarespace is saying they're hiring engineers,

[01:52:49.680 --> 01:52:52.360]   Good news for our friends who were at Gigah-Om,
[01:52:52.360 --> 01:52:57.360]   Fortune is hired, six of Gigah-Om's very good journalists,
[01:52:57.360 --> 01:53:00.160]   including I think our friend Matthew Ingram,
[01:53:00.160 --> 01:53:03.840]   Stacey Higginbotham, Barb Darrow, Katie Fairenbacher,
[01:53:03.840 --> 01:53:06.040]   Jeff John Roberts and Jonathan Vanian.
[01:53:06.040 --> 01:53:08.480]   Those were a lot of people
[01:53:08.480 --> 01:53:11.480]   let go with a sudden demise of Gigah-Om.
[01:53:12.800 --> 01:53:15.040]   You know, some of our favorite people,
[01:53:15.040 --> 01:53:17.320]   including people who've been on this show, like Matthew,
[01:53:17.320 --> 01:53:19.520]   so I'm very happy to hear that.
[01:53:19.520 --> 01:53:21.520]   Thank you, Fortune.
[01:53:21.520 --> 01:53:23.440]   Seems like they're gonna take a run of technology
[01:53:23.440 --> 01:53:25.840]   with six new hires.
[01:53:25.840 --> 01:53:28.360]   Mark Pinkis is back at Zynga.
[01:53:28.360 --> 01:53:31.360]   And the stock we were talking about in a hundred percent.
[01:53:31.360 --> 01:53:33.040]   How much, 20%?
[01:53:33.040 --> 01:53:34.560]   No, 10% percent.
[01:53:34.560 --> 01:53:36.520]   Wow. On the announcement.
[01:53:36.520 --> 01:53:37.600]   Why did he leave Zynga?
[01:53:37.600 --> 01:53:38.720]   Why did he come back?
[01:53:38.720 --> 01:53:41.760]   Zynga was having a lot of trouble.
[01:53:41.760 --> 01:53:42.960]   I think it was two years ago,
[01:53:42.960 --> 01:53:44.800]   Mattrick left, where was it a year ago?
[01:53:44.800 --> 01:53:48.960]   I forget. Anyway, Don Mattrick left the Xbox unit
[01:53:48.960 --> 01:53:52.240]   at Microsoft and came to kind of rescue Zynga.
[01:53:52.240 --> 01:53:53.600]   Their stock price was tanking.
[01:53:53.600 --> 01:53:56.720]   You know, there were only so many farmville games
[01:53:56.720 --> 01:54:00.560]   they could make and he didn't do it.
[01:54:00.560 --> 01:54:03.360]   I mean, it's still things were just kind of chugging along.
[01:54:03.360 --> 01:54:05.520]   Mattrick says he wanted to go back to Canada.
[01:54:05.520 --> 01:54:07.840]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:54:07.840 --> 01:54:08.480]   Yeah.
[01:54:08.480 --> 01:54:11.600]   So new version of the spend more time with
[01:54:11.600 --> 01:54:12.480]   my family.
[01:54:12.480 --> 01:54:13.440]   Yeah, my family.
[01:54:13.440 --> 01:54:14.880]   It's been more time with Canada.
[01:54:14.880 --> 01:54:17.760]   It's interesting that Pinkis came back, though,
[01:54:17.760 --> 01:54:20.320]   instead of them finding some new blood.
[01:54:20.320 --> 01:54:22.160]   Because I think I've read there were some rumors.
[01:54:22.160 --> 01:54:24.400]   Pinkis wanted to start another thing or something.
[01:54:24.400 --> 01:54:28.640]   But apparently he wants to get another shot of CEO.
[01:54:28.640 --> 01:54:29.680]   Was he still chairman?
[01:54:29.680 --> 01:54:31.920]   I think he's chairman of the board.
[01:54:31.920 --> 01:54:32.320]   Yeah.
[01:54:32.320 --> 01:54:35.120]   So I don't know.
[01:54:35.120 --> 01:54:36.320]   It's not a great job.
[01:54:36.320 --> 01:54:40.800]   I don't know what the reality is.
[01:54:41.760 --> 01:54:45.200]   I mean, it's a company without great prospects.
[01:54:45.200 --> 01:54:47.600]   That has to deal with public market pressures.
[01:54:47.600 --> 01:54:47.920]   Yeah.
[01:54:47.920 --> 01:54:51.520]   And they've lost a lot of people who continue losing people.
[01:54:51.520 --> 01:54:56.960]   And they just really haven't managed the transition to mobile board
[01:54:56.960 --> 01:55:00.000]   given any indication that that's going to change.
[01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:01.680]   And they have Cinka poker.
[01:55:01.680 --> 01:55:04.720]   Yeah, which was a disaster.
[01:55:04.720 --> 01:55:07.920]   They like updated it and like the new version was terrible.
[01:55:07.920 --> 01:55:10.640]   And so they had to like re-release the old one.
[01:55:10.640 --> 01:55:13.840]   When you lose $290 million, I'm sorry,
[01:55:13.840 --> 01:55:19.200]   $209 million in 2012, then $226 million in 2013,
[01:55:19.200 --> 01:55:21.760]   you know, trouble troubles ahead.
[01:55:21.760 --> 01:55:24.000]   You can only lose so many hundreds of millions of dollars.
[01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:29.760]   Do you think Pinkis is there forever or is he just there
[01:55:29.760 --> 01:55:31.040]   until they find somebody else?
[01:55:31.040 --> 01:55:33.280]   Some people were saying it's so sudden that he said,
[01:55:33.280 --> 01:55:34.240]   yeah, yeah, I'll take over.
[01:55:34.240 --> 01:55:36.880]   That's what it feels like to me.
[01:55:36.880 --> 01:55:39.120]   I mean, again, like Ben said,
[01:55:39.120 --> 01:55:41.680]   I mean, it's not the kind of company people are going to be dying to run.
[01:55:41.680 --> 01:55:45.200]   They're not going to be able to find some super hero to swoop in
[01:55:45.200 --> 01:55:46.400]   and fix things right away.
[01:55:46.400 --> 01:55:49.520]   And just telling of this industry, especially mobile games,
[01:55:49.520 --> 01:55:54.800]   it's like these one hit wonders and the IPO, they get hot for a second.
[01:55:54.800 --> 01:55:59.120]   And then nothing after that, they just can't recreate that magic again.
[01:55:59.120 --> 01:56:02.800]   And Zinga was a little different because they were a desktop game
[01:56:02.800 --> 01:56:05.120]   built within Facebook piggybacking off Facebook.
[01:56:05.120 --> 01:56:07.440]   And they just they just can't adapt.
[01:56:08.640 --> 01:56:14.720]   Really happy for our sponsor, Linda.com, Linda Wyman, sold Linda.com
[01:56:14.720 --> 01:56:17.520]   to LinkedIn for $1.5 billion.
[01:56:17.520 --> 01:56:21.440]   Just showing tech at his hot category right now,
[01:56:21.440 --> 01:56:23.040]   it's actually makes a lot of sense.
[01:56:23.040 --> 01:56:26.000]   LinkedIn, which is all about kind of professional networking,
[01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:31.040]   could use, you know, some education, professional education and so forth.
[01:56:31.040 --> 01:56:35.840]   Linda founded Linda.com with her husband Bruce Heaven in 1995.
[01:56:36.640 --> 01:56:41.920]   It's 20 years old and one and a half billion dollars.
[01:56:41.920 --> 01:56:45.600]   I remember when Linda was writing web tutorials.
[01:56:45.600 --> 01:56:46.000]   Me too.
[01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:46.560]   It's amazing.
[01:56:46.560 --> 01:56:48.160]   We used to interview her on the screen set.
[01:56:48.160 --> 01:56:48.880]   It was all the time.
[01:56:48.880 --> 01:56:49.920]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:56:49.920 --> 01:56:50.720]   It's just awesome.
[01:56:50.720 --> 01:56:52.320]   So proud of her.
[01:56:52.320 --> 01:56:53.840]   So nicely done.
[01:56:53.840 --> 01:56:59.120]   Just kind of wrapping it up here.
[01:56:59.120 --> 01:57:03.600]   You saw the the robo car that drove across the country, Delphi,
[01:57:03.600 --> 01:57:09.120]   which is I guess an automotive accessories company took an Audi hatchback,
[01:57:09.120 --> 01:57:12.240]   loaded up with autonomous stuff.
[01:57:12.240 --> 01:57:14.640]   What's nice is it doesn't look like an autonomous vehicle.
[01:57:14.640 --> 01:57:16.560]   It's got the stuff hidden behind plastic panels.
[01:57:16.560 --> 01:57:19.120]   So it just looks like a normal car.
[01:57:19.120 --> 01:57:20.560]   They didn't have a driver in it.
[01:57:20.560 --> 01:57:23.200]   15 states, 3400 miles.
[01:57:23.200 --> 01:57:25.760]   The car did almost all the driving itself.
[01:57:25.760 --> 01:57:29.360]   At the only time it was really touch and go,
[01:57:29.920 --> 01:57:35.600]   the driver got very nervous when they went over a metal bridge and he knew that metal was death
[01:57:35.600 --> 01:57:38.560]   to to these autonomous vehicles.
[01:57:38.560 --> 01:57:40.560]   He just hovered his hands over the wheel.
[01:57:40.560 --> 01:57:42.640]   The wheel though, and never did have to take it.
[01:57:42.640 --> 01:57:43.200]   It worked.
[01:57:43.200 --> 01:57:46.400]   The Audi SQ5 went all the way across the country.
[01:57:46.400 --> 01:57:52.000]   That's I think we're getting closer and closer to autonomous vehicles.
[01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:56.080]   There's something to to this.
[01:57:56.080 --> 01:58:00.000]   I think you can see it with with with AI generally is it's not going to.
[01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:04.320]   I think it's less likely to arrive as like a finished product.
[01:58:04.320 --> 01:58:08.880]   Like there was that that like the Google car that they had, you know, like no steering wheel or anything.
[01:58:08.880 --> 01:58:12.880]   That may be in the future, but it's going to come piece by piece.
[01:58:12.880 --> 01:58:14.160]   And you see that already happening, right?
[01:58:14.160 --> 01:58:16.080]   You already have cars that can park themselves.
[01:58:16.080 --> 01:58:20.000]   You have cars that on the freeway can all but dry themselves.
[01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:25.440]   And there's going to be like that Tesla update, but also I think that Mercedes has a similar system.
[01:58:26.240 --> 01:58:31.280]   And so does that will it will be one of those things like what there's that there's that Bill Gates quote.
[01:58:31.280 --> 01:58:36.000]   It's such a great quote like you make less way less progress in two years and you expect
[01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:38.080]   from way more in 10 than you imagine.
[01:58:38.080 --> 01:58:40.080]   It's something along along that lines.
[01:58:40.080 --> 01:58:44.000]   I think that's going to be the same thing with self driving cars with with AI generally.
[01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:48.720]   And and you were starting to see that play out.
[01:58:48.720 --> 01:58:50.720]   And it'll come slow.
[01:58:50.720 --> 01:58:55.040]   I think there's an expectation that self driving cars are going to be one day,
[01:58:55.040 --> 01:58:58.240]   you know, your local car dealer will have a self driving car and be like, I don't know,
[01:58:58.240 --> 01:58:59.120]   but it's not going to happen.
[01:58:59.120 --> 01:59:00.400]   It's going to it's going to creep in.
[01:59:00.400 --> 01:59:01.360]   We've talked about this before.
[01:59:01.360 --> 01:59:03.760]   It's going to be in luxury cars as an auto drive on freeways.
[01:59:03.760 --> 01:59:08.560]   And then there's going to be some sort of like campus taxi service on college campuses and
[01:59:08.560 --> 01:59:09.040]   things like that.
[01:59:09.040 --> 01:59:12.240]   And it's going to creep into our lives to the point where it's not going to be that big a deal
[01:59:12.240 --> 01:59:16.480]   when the first fully auto drive vehicle happens because it will have been we will have all been
[01:59:16.480 --> 01:59:20.000]   on an auto drive vehicle in some context before and it won't be that big a thing.
[01:59:21.040 --> 01:59:25.600]   Big news for podcasters. I'm going to end with this just because we have a little celebration,
[01:59:25.600 --> 01:59:31.840]   I think there was a patent role named personal audio.
[01:59:31.840 --> 01:59:37.440]   They came to us asking, they asked a million and a half dollars, I think, in license fees.
[01:59:37.440 --> 01:59:42.800]   They claimed they had invented podcasting in in 1995.
[01:59:42.800 --> 01:59:45.280]   We were prepared.
[01:59:45.280 --> 01:59:48.400]   We hired a law firm, Adam Corolla got sued.
[01:59:48.400 --> 01:59:49.440]   We didn't ever get sued.
[01:59:49.440 --> 01:59:51.280]   They said, OK, we said no money.
[01:59:51.280 --> 01:59:52.640]   And they said, OK, well, we're going to sue you.
[01:59:52.640 --> 01:59:53.840]   We never heard back from.
[01:59:53.840 --> 01:59:55.040]   But I'm Corolla got sued.
[01:59:55.040 --> 01:59:58.400]   A number of big networks also got sued discovery, I think got sued.
[01:59:58.400 --> 02:00:03.920]   Grammar Girl was a lot of podcasts were approached by these guys.
[02:00:03.920 --> 02:00:10.240]   And we contacted a law firm and we waited and watched for those papers.
[02:00:10.240 --> 02:00:14.320]   One of the things the law firm said you could do, but it's a high risk strategy
[02:00:14.880 --> 02:00:21.360]   is to go back to the US Patent and Trademark Office and try to invalidate the original patent.
[02:00:21.360 --> 02:00:24.080]   They call that an inter partase motion.
[02:00:24.080 --> 02:00:29.200]   The risk is if you lose that just strengthens their case.
[02:00:29.200 --> 02:00:36.560]   They were suing in West or East Texas where patent cases are usually a very strong for the patent
[02:00:36.560 --> 02:00:44.480]   holder. So we were prepared. I had a strategy. We were going to get all the Baptist churches in
[02:00:44.480 --> 02:00:47.600]   Texas that do podcasts to join us for a big picnic out in the
[02:00:47.600 --> 02:00:50.480]   square. The courthouse is on a square.
[02:00:50.480 --> 02:00:56.000]   All the law firms that pursue these patent troll lawsuits are on the square as well in small,
[02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:57.440]   you know, empty offices.
[02:00:57.440 --> 02:01:00.000]   I thought we just have a nice picnic, a little barbecue,
[02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:03.760]   bring all the meat ministers from all the Baptist churches, meet the jury,
[02:01:03.760 --> 02:01:07.600]   get to know the judge. We don't have to.
[02:01:07.600 --> 02:01:11.680]   The EFF decided to go after them within inter partase motion.
[02:01:11.680 --> 02:01:14.800]   They went to the Patent and Trademark Office. We helped kick some money.
[02:01:14.800 --> 02:01:17.040]   And a lot of people did. They raised money to do this.
[02:01:17.040 --> 02:01:19.920]   They got some pro bono work from some big lawyers.
[02:01:19.920 --> 02:01:25.600]   And the very good news is that the US Patent and Trademark Office on April 10th
[02:01:25.600 --> 02:01:29.840]   invalidated the so-called podcasting patent.
[02:01:29.840 --> 02:01:32.560]   This is the time for the 10 year anniversary.
[02:01:32.560 --> 02:01:33.280]   Yeah, thank God.
[02:01:33.280 --> 02:01:37.680]   Well, we, you know, the first thing you do when you go to the lawyers, you say, well,
[02:01:38.400 --> 02:01:44.320]   should we be the really just purely logical business decision is, well, how much do they want?
[02:01:44.320 --> 02:01:46.720]   And how much is it going to cost to go to court?
[02:01:46.720 --> 02:01:49.520]   And of course, you may lose in court.
[02:01:49.520 --> 02:01:53.680]   So there's the risk that you spend a lot of money in court and then lose and still have to pay the
[02:01:53.680 --> 02:01:58.240]   money. I think I'm trying to remember, but I think they asked us for a million and a half bucks.
[02:01:58.240 --> 02:02:02.480]   And I thought that was odd because we were told that the defense would be about a million.
[02:02:02.480 --> 02:02:06.240]   So I think the normal, these guys weren't that bright.
[02:02:06.240 --> 02:02:10.320]   I think normally what you want to do is ask for less than the cost of going to court would cost.
[02:02:10.320 --> 02:02:12.880]   But we were prepared to do it.
[02:02:12.880 --> 02:02:17.520]   Adam Crowlet did, in fact, have to go to court and raise a lot of money through a crowd sourcing
[02:02:17.520 --> 02:02:23.520]   right on. But they dropped the suit against Adam and now I have a feeling they're kind of out of
[02:02:23.520 --> 02:02:27.440]   business. Although they say, well, we're going to go, we'll find some other stuff.
[02:02:27.440 --> 02:02:30.080]   Yeah, it's not over completely.
[02:02:30.080 --> 02:02:34.880]   But thanks to the electronic frontier foundation, the cyber law clinic at Harvard's Berkman Center
[02:02:34.880 --> 02:02:40.880]   for Internet and Society. And I'm glad the patent and trademark office made the right decision.
[02:02:40.880 --> 02:02:42.800]   Bottom line, these guys didn't invent podcasting.
[02:02:42.800 --> 02:02:47.600]   Oh, we're practicing it. They were what we call, and the nice way to say patent drill is non-practicing
[02:02:47.600 --> 02:02:51.520]   entity. Somebody that owns a patent, but doesn't, in fact, tend to use it.
[02:02:51.520 --> 02:02:53.120]   And they found a patent that looked good.
[02:02:53.120 --> 02:02:57.440]   Well, and there's prior art that proves that it's not as good as they thought.
[02:02:57.440 --> 02:03:02.080]   And that we were very involved in the finding of prior art. Kevin Marks, who kind of did a lot
[02:03:02.080 --> 02:03:05.760]   of this early stuff, was very helpful with that as well.
[02:03:05.760 --> 02:03:11.440]   Yeah, a guy named Carl Malmud, who really is a pioneer in podcasting, had a geek of the
[02:03:11.440 --> 02:03:14.720]   week online radio show he offered for download many years before this patent.
[02:03:14.720 --> 02:03:22.400]   CBC and CNN also did. So a victory. The EFS said, unfortunately, our work to protect
[02:03:22.400 --> 02:03:27.280]   podcasting is not done. Personal audio continues to seek patents related to podcasting.
[02:03:27.280 --> 02:03:31.680]   We will continue to fight for podcasters. We hope the patent office does not give them
[02:03:31.680 --> 02:03:36.800]   any more weapons to shake down small podcasters or big podcasters or any podcaster.
[02:03:36.800 --> 02:03:40.560]   I want to thank you for being here. Ben, I know it's very early in the morning in Taiwan,
[02:03:40.560 --> 02:03:49.120]   but we really appreciate it. Go to stratecary.com's S-T-R-A-T-E-C-H-E-R-Y. Sign up for Ben's newsletter.

[02:03:56.400 --> 02:04:00.000]   No, and there is a, there is a, there is not, I mean, obviously I would love everyone to
[02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:07.440]   sign up for the newsletter, but there is a free weekly post as well, plus my podcast at exponet.fm.
