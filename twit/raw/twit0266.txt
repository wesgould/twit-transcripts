[00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:40.360]   It's time for Tuit.
[00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.640]   This week in tech, the shoe.
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.760]   It really great shoe that covers all the technology news.
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.640]   Here he is with his luscious hair.
[00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.760]   Just looking fantastic.
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.840]   Which is surprising because his show just got canceled.
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.600]   John C. Devorak.
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:56.120]   Good to see you.
[00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.800]   Hello.
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.440]   We're going to talk about cranky geeks leaving the airwaves
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:00.000]   next week.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.840]   That's terrible, terrible news.
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.600]   Also here with us, Barretunde Thurston from Brooklyn.
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.360]   Brooklyn represented well.
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.000]   Very well on this show.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.480]   It's great to see you again, Barretunde.
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:12.080]   When's your book come out?
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.320]   My book comes out in the years.
[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.360]   We have plenty of time to keep pumping those pre-sales and email
[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.160]   signups at barretunde.com.
[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.920]   There you go.
[00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.600]   And in the meantime, there are other people
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.200]   with newer publication dates or recently published dates.
[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.960]   Like perhaps this fellow here.
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.040]   Perfect segue.
[00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.280]   Nick Milton of the Bits Blog.
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.000]   He's the editor.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.120]   You're the editor of Bits Blog on the New York Times site, right?
[00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.720]   I'm the lead technology writer.
[00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.160]   Lead technology writer.
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.320]   And the author of a brand new book.
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.600]   Yes, here, here.
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:43.640]   I live in the future.
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.880]   And here's how it works by Nick Milton.
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.400]   What's in that book?
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.640]   The future is in that book.
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:50.160]   Wow.
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.160]   Yeah.
[00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.400]   Lots of good stuff about the next five years
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.960]   and how technology is changing society and things like that.
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.440]   And he has a dog named Pixel.
[00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.600]   I'd like to know who's going to win the Triple Crown next.
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:04.640]   Wouldn't that be useful?
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:05.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.360]   If you buy the book, John, you may actually get that answer.
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.360]   I'll call the publisher and get a review copy.
[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.840]   Is there a cue?
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.040]   Yeah, he doesn't buy anything there.
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.440]   Is there a QR code for that?
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.240]   Yeah.
[00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.760]   Actually--
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:17.760]   Secret.
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.200]   It's a little Easter egg in the book.
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.360]   That's kind of neat because every chapter has a QR code leading
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.240]   into it that you can then, with your smartphone, I guess,
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.600]   take a picture of and then it will bring you to the forum
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.240]   where you can comment on that.
[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.320]   Yeah, this video is all the links I talk about,
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.920]   all the papers, research papers and news articles and books.
[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.360]   I link to them on a mobile site and a mobile application.
[00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.080]   And then you can comment.
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.640]   And there's actually people going in there
[00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.640]   and having conversations about the chapter
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.440]   and calling me funny names.
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.360]   Not-- and I didn't mean to insult you.
[00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.520]   And I said this before the show started.
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.240]   But it seems like that's the kind of thing,
[00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.560]   like fins on a car that will seem
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.920]   appear dated in some time in the future, maybe not
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:56.760]   so far just to suit you.
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:57.560]   I like those things.
[00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:58.240]   QR codes?
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.740]   Yeah.
[00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:59.720]   I think it was a good idea.
[00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.880]   I guess what other way could you do it?
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.040]   Well, there's these things.
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.800]   There's one technology I forget the name of it
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.680]   where you can take a picture of a series of words
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.720]   and it recognizes what it is.
[00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.880]   But even that, you have to have a certain type of phone
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.760]   and a certain app and your camera has to be pretty high res.
[00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.440]   And so, some of the codes seem like the best solution.
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.800]   Although, I think, yeah, maybe when Google goggles gets more
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.400]   mature, that would be the kind of thing goggles could do
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:23.080]   directly.
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.240]   John, what are you doing?
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.120]   You sounds like you're disassembling some licorice ones
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.880]   out, doesn't it?
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:28.920]   Trying to get what you'd like.
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.160]   He's trying to remove all the black jelly beans from Gina's
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.080]   gift.
[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.080]   Gina Travani is also here.
[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.920]   Gina is the co-host of This Week in Google on our network.
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.960]   She writes blogs at smartawear.org, founder of LifeHacker.
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.880]   She still writes there and does a great column too
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.560]   on Fast Company.
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.280]   In fact, her new video piece is Fast Company.com/worksmart
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:50.800]   very cool.
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.600]   And it's her birthday.
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:54.240]   It is.
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.760]   Hello.
[00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:55.400]   Happy birthday.
[00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:56.440]   Happy birthday, Gina.
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:01.120]   Gina is exactly as old as the 6502.
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.040]   Yes, I am.
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.840]   Yes, I am.
[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.160]   Is that an old Pontiac you're talking about?
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:04.880]   No, no, no, no.
[00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.720]   You know the 6502, which powered the Apple II computer,
[00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.280]   the Atari 1st Atari 200.
[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:10.320]   Chuck Petal.
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.760]   Chuck Petal, very good, yeah.
[00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.800]   1975 was a fine year.
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.240]   In fact, I have somewhere, if I can find it,
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.640]   I guess if I go to leovilleduposterous.com,
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:21.960]   I'll be able to find it.
[00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:26.360]   A ad that was kind of co-contemporary
[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:30.480]   with the launch of the 6502.
[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.120]   Let me see if I can find this here.
[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.760]   Featuring William Shatner.
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:36.680]   Looking very young.
[00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.880]   Looking very young and swelled and slim.
[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:40.920]   And he's advertising.
[00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:41.680]   And handsome.
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:42.920]   Let's not forget.
[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:45.880]   Advertising for-- well, let me just play it for you,
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.440]   because it's kind of cool to see.
[00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:49.440]   He beams in.
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.440]   [VIDEO PLAYBACK]
[00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:54.960]   Invest in the wonder computer of the 1980s for under $300.
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.320]   What is he doing with his hands?
[00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.160]   Unlike games that have real computer keyboard.
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.200]   Touching the keyboard.
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.880]   With a Commodore VIC-20, the whole family
[00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:03.680]   can learn computing at home.
[00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:04.520]   Play's great games.
[00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.440]   [CHEERING]
[00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.240]   Under $300, a hundred computer of the 90s.
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:10.160]   Looks like a Mac.
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:17.160]   The Commodore VIC-20.
[00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:18.960]   Wow, I love-- thank God for YouTube.
[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.160]   We wouldn't have any record of that.
[00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.000]   That was awesome.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.040]   That was amazing.
[00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.960]   Did you have a-- who had a Commodore 64?
[00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:27.000]   You guys are all too young.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:27.680]   You've had a--
[00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:28.520]   So I did.
[00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:29.240]   Totally, yeah.
[00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:29.520]   Yeah.
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:30.480]   I used to play Chuck Yeager.
[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:34.480]   I write little code where I would like 10 if press X go 220.
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:35.920]   I mean, it was awesome.
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:39.320]   Chuck Yeager was like the original flight simulator.
[00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:41.240]   No, it was the game where you had to collect eggs.
[00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:42.200]   It was almost like a--
[00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:43.200]   Oh, Chuck Yeager.
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:44.560]   Not Chuck Yeager.
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:45.320]   Chuck-- Chuck Yeager.
[00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:48.240]   Yeah, Chuck Yeager.
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:49.240]   It was like a ghetto Mario.
[00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:50.400]   A big check game was for the--
[00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.720]   I was trying to sound so smart.
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:53.560]   Oh, yeah, Chuck Yeager.
[00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:54.280]   Yeah, he's the guy.
[00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:57.440]   It was-- there was an era Chuck Yeager flight simulator
[00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:58.560]   game there was.
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:01.480]   I fully expect Nick to write, I live in the past,
[00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:02.440]   and here's how it works.
[00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:02.960]   Yeah.
[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:04.440]   That's my second book.
[00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:06.840]   If somebody could figure out how the past works,
[00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:07.720]   I would be thrilled.
[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:09.480]   I would buy that book.
[00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:10.760]   Forget the future.
[00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:14.200]   We barely handle the past.
[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:16.240]   Well, let's talk about this week's news.
[00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:17.960]   That was one of the stories, of course,
[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:21.680]   was that the 6502 hit its 35th birthday.
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:23.000]   I mean, 35's not that old.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.160]   Look at Gina.
[00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.800]   But for a computer, that's ancient, isn't it?
[00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.080]   For technology, that's really, really old.
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:32.560]   It feels like that was the dark ages
[00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:34.120]   of personal computing.
[00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:37.920]   On our cycles of upgrade and our expectations
[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:40.680]   have accelerated along with time.
[00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:43.480]   So if you have a three-year-old computer,
[00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:45.920]   that's a pretty much a stretch.
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:49.840]   A 35-year-old computer is just sort of an artifact
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:51.360]   that belongs in a museum, really.
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.880]   So to think about what that could do in the upper limits
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:57.160]   of those times versus what we expect now is a big disconnect.
[00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:00.400]   As a matter of fact, I did write for a Hui magazine.
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:03.760]   A Hui magazine, the Commodore 64, Obvious Mag.
[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:04.960]   Yeah.
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:08.960]   Yeah, I wrote a chip room in the chat room.
[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:12.000]   I used to write for an old Atari magazine.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.680]   So those days were really long ago.
[00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:18.720]   It's funny, and now where things move faster than ever,
[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:19.560]   don't they?
[00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:21.000]   Right, and there's no magazines.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.400]   And there's no magazines.
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:24.120]   There really are magazines.
[00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:26.680]   Nick, what is it like in the New York Times newsroom
[00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:27.120]   these days?
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:31.400]   I mean, you are the future of the New York Times, the website.
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:32.280]   It's fun.
[00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:34.400]   I mean, it's pretty interesting.
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:37.320]   There's a new culture of journalists that is coming in.
[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:39.240]   And I'm part of that crew.
[00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:42.320]   And people like Brian Stelter who writes on the media desk.
[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:44.520]   And we're just trying to experiment
[00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:47.560]   with real-time reporting and tweeting as we're researching
[00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:52.000]   and asking people questions and the blog format
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.360]   versus the print format.
[00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:54.440]   And it's fun.
[00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:56.280]   I mean, we're having a really great time.
[00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:58.120]   Yeah, I would say of all the newspapers--
[00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:59.840]   and this would be kind of the last thing you'd
[00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:01.800]   expect of the great lady of all the newspapers out there
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:04.200]   in the New York Times has, in fact, done a--
[00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:07.200]   I would say a great job of moving into the future.
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:09.160]   Although you look at something like USA Today, which
[00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:12.680]   we would also say maybe another press effort to be
[00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:13.680]   futuristic.
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:16.840]   And they're talking about putting the print paper
[00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:18.520]   to bed, basically.
[00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:19.680]   Well, I mean, it's fascinating.
[00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:22.000]   In the newsroom, there's a group of hackers
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.120]   that they hack code all day.
[00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:24.600]   Really?
[00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:25.960]   And they look at documents.
[00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:28.400]   And yeah, it's pretty impressive to see the way
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:31.080]   that that's transitioned and that's happened.
[00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:33.320]   You didn't get bit by--
[00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:34.200]   let's be honest here.
[00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:39.800]   And anybody get bit by the tornado Twitter picture.
[00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:41.080]   You know what I'm talking about?
[00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:42.360]   No, I luckily did not.
[00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:43.200]   I was having--
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:45.760]   I was at a party that evening, so I did not.
[00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:49.640]   The Time Magazine people got bit, time blogger.
[00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:50.600]   So there were what?
[00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:53.920]   There were some minor tornadoes in the Queens and the Bronx.
[00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:54.440]   Is that right?
[00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:55.440]   In Brooklyn.
[00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:56.440]   Yeah.
[00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:58.800]   How does it-- we have three people from Brooklyn
[00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:00.320]   on Skype today.
[00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:01.400]   That's just a weird coincidence.
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:02.840]   Because Brooklyn is just dominating.
[00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:03.840]   That's just how it works.
[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:04.840]   It is.
[00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:06.720]   If it was a city on its own, it would be like the--
[00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:08.520]   I don't know, the fourth largest city in the States
[00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:09.320]   or something like that.
[00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:12.480]   0.3 million incredible people live in Brooklyn.
[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:13.800]   It's bigger than what happened by far.
[00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:14.640]   It's a massive city.
[00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:16.320]   It's a planet, if you want to be honest.
[00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:18.520]   How many unincredible people are there?
[00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:20.080]   About two minutes.
[00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:21.280]   We don't like to talk about them.
[00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:22.280]   Thanks, Sean.
[00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:23.200]   That's a good question.
[00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:25.760]   I do not appreciate your insightful journalism.
[00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:27.720]   That's, by the way, that's a new Pixar film,
[00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:29.120]   The Unincredible.
[00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:30.880]   How many did a theater near you?
[00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:32.240]   So there was a--
[00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:33.920]   I mean, come on, Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens,
[00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:35.080]   a can of been a tornado.
[00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:36.400]   It was like a funnel cloud, right?
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:37.480]   It was two tornadoes.
[00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:40.120]   It was pretty insane.
[00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:44.720]   There was trees on top of cars and cats and dogs.
[00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:45.640]   It was actually--
[00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:48.440]   In all seriousness, there was a guy who took photos of actually
[00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:50.760]   video of some crabs in the park.
[00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:51.560]   Great.
[00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:53.400]   You got two million people with all those phones.
[00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:54.400]   Where's the movie?
[00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:57.600]   Where's the video of this funnel cloud of any sort?
[00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:00.480]   Well, this was a burst, a micro burst, this bullcrap.
[00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:04.800]   But that's what happened because somebody found a 25-year-old
[00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:09.240]   picture of an actual tornado near the Statue of Liberty.
[00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:11.960]   Twit picked it, actually--
[00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:13.800]   Might have been a blogger from Time Magazine.
[00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:15.160]   That's just photo-shopped it.
[00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:16.520]   Yeah, you could have.
[00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:17.120]   But it wasn't.
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:18.160]   This is a real photo.
[00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:21.720]   Somebody found it on the NOAA site.
[00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:22.880]   And it took over Twitter.
[00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:24.200]   Everybody said, oh my god.
[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:27.160]   This is a tornado that almost blew over the Statue
[00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:28.720]   of Liberty.
[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:30.240]   Kind of embarrassing.
[00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:33.000]   But see, that's in the age of instant journalism, Nick.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.040]   That could happen to anybody.
[00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:36.000]   Right?
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.320]   It's true, but it was quickly realized that it was fake.
[00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:40.800]   And that can happen too.
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:43.800]   Ah, so your point being, yes, news breaks fast,
[00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:47.000]   but it also gets corrected.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.960]   It's also rectified very quickly, I think.
[00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:52.440]   It's kind of the Wikipedia style of a fact.
[00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:54.200]   It's true, yeah.
[00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:55.000]   I guess that's--
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.640]   Do you find-- and this is a newsroom question for Nick,
[00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:59.760]   which we've never talked about, kind of not on the show.
[00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:04.120]   But do you find that corrections are closer in volume
[00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:07.960]   of reach to the initial mistake nowadays than they were
[00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:09.080]   in the past?
[00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:11.800]   Because I always worry that that first tweet or Facebook
[00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:14.360]   up to the email or blog post goes out,
[00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:15.920]   and that establishes a certain fact.
[00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:17.440]   You later find out it's wrong.
[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:19.000]   Now, with the high-speed communications
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.720]   we have, the correction comes out sooner.
[00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:24.000]   Does it have a larger effect on the impact of the original
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.480]   because it moves so much faster now?
[00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:26.640]   That's a very good question.
[00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:27.840]   Well, it's a good question.
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:30.000]   I think one of the things that we struggled with
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.400]   in the technology section is that, you know,
[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:33.560]   when you-- let's be realistic.
[00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:35.480]   OK, so Apple puts out a press release
[00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:38.640]   that they're releasing a new iPad, right?
[00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:42.120]   Most tech blogs, the goal is to get it up as soon as possible,
[00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:42.620]   right?
[00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:44.080]   So what they'll do is they'll write one sentence
[00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:45.880]   and they'll copy and paste the press release.
[00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:47.280]   At the times, we're not allowed to do that.
[00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:48.840]   It's part of the standards that we can't do that.
[00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:50.040]   We have to report the story.
[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:52.840]   So we have to, as quickly as possible,
[00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:55.520]   get something together that's a story and get it up.
[00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:58.320]   And it can take 15, 16, 17 minutes sometimes.
[00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:00.960]   And that's a pretty big deal when you're looking at this,
[00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:03.360]   especially the technology blog of first base.
[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:06.400]   And we go through the same thing with other breaking news.
[00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:09.440]   And I think we just have to be really careful that we don't--
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:11.080]   we don't put something up unless we've actually
[00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:13.840]   done the research and the reporting to say, hey, this
[00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:15.880]   actually did happen or this didn't.
[00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:18.760]   So the Softpost does have a video, supposedly,
[00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:21.000]   of the-- it has a video of the event,
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.320]   but there's no tornado cloud that I can see,
[00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:24.760]   just a bunch of rain.
[00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:26.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:28.680]   It was definitely more-- I mean, one of my friends
[00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:32.160]   showed me a photo from the-- there used to be a roof
[00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:34.320]   over the hallway of his apartment building.
[00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:35.240]   And he showed me this picture.
[00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:36.800]   I'm like, oh, that's a beautiful skylight.
[00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:38.400]   He's like, no, the roof got ripped off.
[00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:39.400]   Whoa, skylight.
[00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:40.800]   That's a hole.
[00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:42.640]   At first, I thought I was jealous of him
[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:44.560]   for having so much natural light in his building.
[00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:46.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:47.200]   That wasn't that true.
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:47.760]   That was very good.
[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:48.720]   It was very good.
[00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:50.800]   Aren't you glass half full kind of a guy?
[00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:53.800]   I'm glass has something in it kind of guy.
[00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:55.400]   Yeah, very, very nice.
[00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:56.520]   I like that, Berrits.
[00:13:56.520 --> 00:14:00.160]   John, I actually-- I thought it was BS at first.
[00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.120]   I thought that it wasn't a hurricane.
[00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:04.360]   But actually yesterday, the Times put out a newsreller
[00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:06.320]   that the National Weather Association said
[00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:08.800]   that we're too hurricane-- I'm too tornado, sorry--
[00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:10.760]   that did strike Brooklyn on Thursday.
[00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:11.000]   So--
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.640]   Right, it just surprised me with that many people
[00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:16.080]   that one person has a picture of the funnel cloud.
[00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:17.680]   I mean, it looks like a microburst to me
[00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:19.680]   where you have a lot of heavy wind,
[00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:21.880]   the kind of thing that drops airplanes.
[00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:25.000]   I mean, this video I'm watching is just mostly just a kind
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.880]   of a deluge.
[00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:30.040]   A prima, la dien--
[00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:31.440]   We could-- Bartender, you want to give me a hand
[00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:33.080]   with Photoshop, something real quick for John?
[00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:34.440]   That would help.
[00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:35.840]   Then then we'd be back on track.
[00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:38.280]   There's a tornado inside the path mark in Brooklyn.
[00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:39.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:41.320]   Everyone's picking up a subway train.
[00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:42.960]   No, that was just a really hungry lady.
[00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:44.520]   We'll have one of the guys in the chat room.
[00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:47.200]   By the end of the show, we'll have a beautifully done--
[00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:49.440]   It's harder to fake video, though, right?
[00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:50.000]   Videos, yeah.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.200]   Well, they'll just have a photo.
[00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:53.000]   Yeah, where's the photos, even?
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.120]   Well, there's that one photo.
[00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:55.000]   But there's--
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:55.800]   There are a lot of photos.
[00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:59.280]   I saw a photo of the M from the Met Food sign, two blocks
[00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:02.560]   from the actual Met Food and just trees just crossing--
[00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:04.480]   Yeah, but somebody could have picked up that sign
[00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:05.000]   and moved it.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.520]   That was dark stuff.
[00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:09.360]   People in Missouri are going, you guys are such wimps.
[00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:13.400]   There's one tornado in this tiny little tornado.
[00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:16.240]   And it's like the big news, because this is exactly
[00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:17.880]   what the rest of the country thinks.
[00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:19.400]   Yeah, everything centers around New York.
[00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:20.280]   It's around New York.
[00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:22.400]   Oh my god, they had a tornado.
[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:22.960]   Wow.
[00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:25.160]   The Oklahoma-Homans are going, what?
[00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:26.600]   That wasn't a tornado.
[00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:29.720]   That was a heavy wind.
[00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:32.920]   Let's talk about-- well, as long as we're talking about fast
[00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:36.520]   press, Mike Harrington publishes a story this morning
[00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:40.560]   on TechCrunch saying Facebook's doing a phone.
[00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:42.720]   Mike probably figured that Facebook wouldn't get around
[00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:44.320]   to correcting that till Monday, and he'd
[00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:47.320]   get at least a 24-hour news cycle.
[00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:50.400]   Facebook apparently wise to TechCrunch's tricks.
[00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:53.960]   Immediately he says, that is so not true.
[00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:54.960]   Yeah.
[00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:56.040]   I'm not sure what I'm doing.
[00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:58.920]   I mean, I saw the rumor go up.
[00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:00.880]   I read, actually, there was an extensive piece
[00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:05.360]   by Jose Vargas in New Yorker this week, where he profiles
[00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:06.480]   Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:07.720]   That's a good article.
[00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:08.480]   Great piece.
[00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:11.640]   Actually, Emil Dash did a really good follow-up on that.
[00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:14.200]   They're both very long pieces, but if you have time,
[00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:15.640]   I think they're both quite worthy.
[00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:17.720]   And then New Yorker posted that one online, which is nice.
[00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:19.840]   You can go to New Yorker.com and read it, which is cool.
[00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:22.680]   Yeah, I insta-paper that, and read it on my iPad.
[00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:26.160]   But the idea that Facebook would do a phone,
[00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:28.000]   it seems actually a little bit troubling,
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.080]   but also quite logical.
[00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:31.160]   I mean, there's so much of your world that's in there.
[00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:32.320]   They're posting photos.
[00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:34.600]   The idea of your heavily, your contacts in one place.
[00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:36.040]   I'm not a fan of it, because I imagine
[00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:38.760]   that a Facebook phone would default to speaker phone
[00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:40.920]   mode or something highly public.
[00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:44.120]   Privacy, you want privacy, get another phone.
[00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:47.600]   But if you didn't have those trust issues,
[00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:50.040]   I think the concept of an entity that
[00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:53.360]   knows who you communicate with on what frequency and manages
[00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:56.400]   a lot of your media already to have more than an app,
[00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:59.800]   but an actually a device that puts you totally in sync with that
[00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:01.360]   does make some amount of sense.
[00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:01.880]   Greeley.
[00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:04.960]   We have higher trust than Facebook.
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:07.960]   So I'll throw that out there as a logical possibility.
[00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:10.000]   When you add the controversy around Facebook,
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.720]   it's very troubling.
[00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:12.320]   I agree.
[00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:14.480]   I see Facebook likes to go over and target.
[00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:16.920]   Hold on, let me let-- let's say Gina talk here.
[00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:17.400]   Oh, sorry.
[00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:17.920]   Sorry.
[00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:21.680]   I just saw those Facebook credit gift cards in Target last week.
[00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:23.000]   And I was surprised.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:23.480]   I was surprised.
[00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:24.560]   I had never seen them before.
[00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:26.120]   And then when I heard about the phone,
[00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:27.120]   I thought about it.
[00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:28.760]   It was like, if I'm a junior or senior in high school
[00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:30.440]   or even college, and I'm shopping for a phone,
[00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:32.400]   I'm getting my first cell phone, the Facebook phone
[00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:34.360]   just makes total sense.
[00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:35.680]   I mean, I'm not that person.
[00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:37.720]   But it makes a lot of sense.
[00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:39.400]   I feel like marketing-wise, it would be a smart move.
[00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:39.960]   Really?
[00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:40.440]   OK, see?
[00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:40.960]   I--
[00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:41.400]   So--
[00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:42.280]   I looked at that article.
[00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:43.680]   I thought, that's not true.
[00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:45.440]   And of course, Facebook immediately says, well,
[00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:47.280]   we are in the business of making sure
[00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:49.360]   that every phone that comes out has Facebook on it.
[00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:51.680]   But the last thing we want to do is make a phone.
[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:53.080]   What do they need to make a phone for?
[00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:54.240]   Every phone has to have Facebook.
[00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:57.400]   In fact, we talked on Windows Weekly this week
[00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:01.320]   to the guy responsible for evangelizing Microsoft's Windows
[00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:02.600]   Phone 7.
[00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:05.840]   And this week, they announced, you bet, a Twitter app,
[00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:06.560]   a Facebook app.
[00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:08.400]   You don't ship a smartphone without Facebook
[00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:09.160]   on it these days.
[00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:11.360]   Usually built in, right?
[00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:14.400]   But I mean, they get 100 million people
[00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:16.560]   that are accessing the mobile site
[00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:19.640]   and using their mobile apps every month.
[00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:21.840]   So it's a lot of people using it.
[00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:24.200]   But about them working on a phone,
[00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:27.520]   I worked in a story that-- a blog post I posted earlier
[00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:33.160]   this month about Amazon has been discussing their Lab 126
[00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:35.360]   about building other devices beyond the Kindle.
[00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:37.920]   And one of the things that they actually discussed internally
[00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:40.120]   was the idea of doing a phone.
[00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:41.640]   They're not as far as I know.
[00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:43.200]   They're not moving forward with that right now.
[00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:45.360]   But that was a discussion in a meeting
[00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:48.240]   that I got from a couple of sources there.
[00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:50.520]   So if Apple's moving into--
[00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:52.560]   if Apple and Microsoft are moving into their turf,
[00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:54.880]   why wouldn't they move the other way also?
[00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:57.800]   I guess that's true because I kind of mocked the idea
[00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:59.360]   that Amazon would do hardware.
[00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:01.160]   I thought that was a very strange thing to do.
[00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:02.960]   And obviously, I was wrong about that.
[00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:06.000]   They've had a huge success with the Kindle.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.160]   Even in the face of competition from the iPad,
[00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:10.320]   they continue to sell very, very well.
[00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:11.960]   So maybe it is?
[00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:13.520]   They've taken a pretty amazing approach with that.
[00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:16.440]   I mean, I originally thought that as soon as the iPad came out,
[00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:20.080]   why would someone spend $250 on a Kindle
[00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:21.600]   when you can get almost a full computer?
[00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:23.440]   But their approach with going the other way
[00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:26.440]   and saying, you know, it will sell you on for $140.
[00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:27.720]   I think it's worked pretty well for them.
[00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:29.080]   Brilliant.
[00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:30.040]   They're so cheap now.
[00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:31.640]   And they're nice.
[00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:33.880]   Somebody called the radio show the other day and said,
[00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:37.120]   well, I've heard about this when I was a pan digital.
[00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:39.840]   And there's all these other ebook readers.
[00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:40.680]   What should I buy?
[00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:41.920]   And it seems to me a no brainer.
[00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:43.400]   You just buy the Amazon one.
[00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:45.040]   I mean, they just own that market.
[00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:47.720]   Apparently, my space is thinking of doing a phone too,
[00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:50.880]   but it's going to be a busy junk.
[00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:53.280]   Really lousy design.
[00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:55.200]   Hey, I got a million of them.
[00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:57.480]   It allows you to customize your phone so you can't use it.
[00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:59.320]   That's all right.
[00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:01.160]   As always playing music.
[00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:03.960]   And it's got moving background and all paper.
[00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:07.080]   It's covered with animated GIFs.
[00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:08.640]   It's like--
[00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:11.160]   You know, my space phone seems like a good idea, actually.
[00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:12.480]   Now I think about it.
[00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:14.720]   Dancing Bears.
[00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:17.040]   A cat running back and forth across the screen.
[00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:18.320]   John C. Devorak is here.
[00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:19.880]   Nick Bilton from the New York Times.
[00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:20.840]   Baratunde Thurston.
[00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:22.320]   Great to see him.
[00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:23.320]   Gina Trapani.
[00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:24.280]   Her birthday today.
[00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:26.600]   We've got a lot more to talk about before we go on.
[00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:29.720]   I want to talk a little bit about go to my PC.
[00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:33.120]   My great folks are great friends at Citrix.
[00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:35.600]   Guys who do remote access at the highest level.
[00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:38.120]   They're, you know, remote access for the enterprise.
[00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:39.920]   They also do great consumer products.
[00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:42.640]   And if you've never tried remote access and said,
[00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:43.880]   it's too complicated, slow.
[00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:45.160]   I got to get around the firewall.
[00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:46.920]   I got to do port forwarding or DMZing.
[00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:48.680]   You've got to try to go to my PC.
[00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:51.280]   Built in that traversal 128-bit SSL.
[00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:52.680]   Absolutely secure.
[00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:54.200]   There's never been a remote exploit.
[00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:55.080]   This thing works.
[00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:57.560]   It's rock solid and is easy to use.
[00:20:57.560 --> 00:20:58.840]   And absolutely fast.
[00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:00.240]   Go to my PC.
[00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:01.880]   You don't have to take my word for it.
[00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:02.880]   You can try it right now.
[00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:09.280]   30 days free, just go to go to my PC.com/twit.
[00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:12.880]   G-O-T-O-M-Y-P-C.com.
[00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:14.760]   John, are you caught in your own wires there?
[00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:15.560]   Are you stuck?
[00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:16.600]   You can't get any strapped.
[00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:17.720]   He's going to take it out of here.
[00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:18.320]   He's trying to run.
[00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:19.120]   It knocked me in.
[00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:19.800]   You're stuck.
[00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:22.560]   No more leaving than the commercials, the Vorac.
[00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:26.200]   Go to my PC.com/twit.
[00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:27.760]   We thank you for so much for their support
[00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:29.840]   and invite you to give it a try.
[00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:37.880]   Today, other big news in the world Intel says,
[00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:41.440]   anybody who tries to copy a Blu-ray
[00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:45.040]   is going to hear from our lawyers.
[00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:46.880]   What does Intel got to do with it?
[00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:49.080]   They invented HDCP apparently.
[00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:50.760]   So they feel what they're worried sick about
[00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:52.600]   is they're going to get sued by somebody.
[00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:54.000]   Oh, maybe somebody else will sue them.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:54.560]   Yeah.
[00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:55.200]   Look what you did.
[00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:57.160]   Sting your soul as it stinks.
[00:21:57.160 --> 00:22:01.240]   So Monday, it was surprising that it took so long.
[00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:04.040]   How long long did it take high school student DVD John
[00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:06.720]   to crack DVD CSS protection?
[00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:07.520]   Like a week?
[00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:08.520]   Like a month?
[00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:10.680]   It was almost instantaneous.
[00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:11.400]   It was a while.
[00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:13.640]   Well, part of the problem is that in order for a player
[00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:16.800]   to work, it has to have the key.
[00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:19.960]   So these technologies are always going to be flawed
[00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:23.080]   because if you could just figure out where the key is stored,
[00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:25.160]   there always has to be a copy of the key in the clear
[00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:28.160]   in order to play back the DVD or the Blu-ray.
[00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:28.920]   Yeah.
[00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:31.240]   So apparently, this is kind of interesting.
[00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:36.280]   It was found on Monday or appeared on Monday in paste bin.
[00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:37.920]   Gina, you must have used paste bin.
[00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:38.960]   You know about paste bin.
[00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:39.960]   I do know about paste bin.
[00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:41.400]   Those are the places where you post.
[00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:44.880]   Yeah, you usually use it to share code, code code.
[00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:46.720]   It's actually been in the news a couple of times
[00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:50.240]   because I think there was a-- if you search for Visa cards,
[00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:53.040]   you can find a bunch of Visa card numbers on paste bin.
[00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:58.120]   People apparently use it to store their credit cards.
[00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:00.240]   They do not have a good idea.
[00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:02.920]   I've seen like, D-paste used to share code snippets
[00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:04.400]   with people I have heard of this.
[00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:06.880]   Well, I think that's what paste bin is really for,
[00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:09.040]   is a quick way to share little code snippets.
[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:12.440]   It's for open source coders in IRC channels
[00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:14.880]   who want to share code snippets without pasting it
[00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:16.040]   into the entire IRC channel.
[00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:19.000]   That's like the original source of these kinds of sites.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.320]   And it's completely anonymous.
[00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:24.640]   So a great place to do something like share the HDCP code.
[00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:26.920]   It's now mirrored on, of course, on hundreds of other websites.
[00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:33.040]   Let's see, CSS was cracked in 1999.
[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:33.840]   So you're right, John.
[00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:37.800]   It did take a little while for DVDs to be cracked.
[00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:38.960]   How long did it take?
[00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:42.640]   Well, '99, when did DVDs come out?
[00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:45.920]   When did it come out of '64, right?
[00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:47.600]   35 years ago!
[00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:49.400]   There was the declaration of independence.
[00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:52.000]   The DVDs and the Constitution.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.280]   Yeah, let me see.
[00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:56.800]   I'm looking at a Wired article from 1999,
[00:23:56.800 --> 00:24:00.960]   which announced the DVD crack, with the title of it,
[00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:03.920]   why the DVD hack was a cinch.
[00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:08.120]   Talks about this issue of the code being stored
[00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:10.240]   in the clear Jan-Yo-Hansen, the founder of Moore
[00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:12.800]   in Norway, the high school kid who's now known as DVD.
[00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:14.920]   John, he's got actually a pretty good little product now
[00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:15.760]   called Double Twist.
[00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:17.240]   He's gone straight.
[00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:18.280]   When DVDs came out in '65.
[00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:19.280]   What does Double Twist do?
[00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:22.080]   They weren't super popular that first year, obviously.
[00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:23.240]   It took four years.
[00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:26.280]   But Blu-ray's been out longer than four years,
[00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:27.600]   so it took 'em a little longer.
[00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:30.240]   But you gotta figure the MPAA and the motion picture folks
[00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:33.760]   and everybody said, "They broke CSS so fast,
[00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:34.680]   "we gotta find something."
[00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:36.640]   Well, it's not Blu-ray's been out for a long time,
[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:39.720]   but this protocol is fairly new.
[00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:40.560]   The HDCP--
[00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:41.400]   Oh, you're right.
[00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:42.240]   You're right.
[00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:43.080]   HDCP--
[00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:43.920]   That was just another--
[00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:44.760]   Isn't the Blu-ray protection?
[00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:46.400]   It's the protection that keeps you from playing.
[00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:48.520]   Yeah, it's what comes out of the Blu-ray player
[00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:51.200]   into a TV in order to watch a Blu-ray player on a TV.
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:53.920]   Both devices have to HDCP compliant
[00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:56.680]   so that you can't use the analog hole.
[00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:59.360]   So I guess you're right, it's not as old as Blu-ray.
[00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:01.960]   Anyway, that's what they claim it's for,
[00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:05.080]   but the fact of the matter is HDCP was invented
[00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:09.440]   just to add one more feature to a flat screen TV
[00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:11.920]   to make you have to buy a new generation of television.
[00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:13.840]   They've done it just about six times
[00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:15.800]   and they got a new one coming up.
[00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:17.200]   This is a scam.
[00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:19.160]   Pretty soon they're going to have colored TVs
[00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:21.280]   and then you're going to have to buy another one.
[00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:22.840]   It's a scam.
[00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:25.320]   It's a trap.
[00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:26.600]   No, I think you're right.
[00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:27.360]   I'm being facetious.
[00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:28.280]   I think you're right.
[00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:29.000]   It could well be--
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.520]   I have nothing to do with copy protection.
[00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:33.080]   It could have to do with requiring you to buy all new crap.
[00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:35.080]   Yeah, there's another round of this coming too.
[00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:36.440]   There's something they just announced the other day.
[00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:37.600]   I can't remember exactly what it was.
[00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:38.640]   Maybe one of you guys remember.
[00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:39.320]   No it.
[00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:41.640]   But it's some other thing they're going to add to these TVs,
[00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:43.440]   which you're going to have to buy another TV.
[00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:44.440]   Yeah.
[00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:45.480]   I'll just use my computer.
[00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:46.560]   I'm good.
[00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:48.640]   It's a TVzer history.
[00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:49.320]   Oh, they're gone.
[00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:50.320]   TVzer history.
[00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:52.200]   Well, you live in a future near Costco.
[00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:53.760]   Are there any TVs where you live?
[00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:56.720]   I wish they could give a tour of his living room setup.
[00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:57.120]   It is--
[00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:57.920]   Oh, it's insane.
[00:25:57.920 --> 00:25:59.160]   Do you have a TV?
[00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:00.160]   No TV.
[00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:02.880]   I have a TV that is hooked up to a computer
[00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:04.840]   and then I have this wireless little donut mouse.
[00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:09.000]   It looks like a chocolate donut and it's got buttons on it.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:12.400]   And then I have a wireless keyboard and we just use that.
[00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:13.880]   I mean, we don't have cable.
[00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:18.760]   We canceled it over a year ago and it works perfectly.
[00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:19.260]   Yeah.
[00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:21.760]   What are you running onto the TV?
[00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:24.680]   Sometimes Hulu, sometimes Netflix with Boxy,
[00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:27.640]   sometimes just go to YouTube directly on the--
[00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:30.080]   I mean, it's just pretty much everything.
[00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:31.520]   It's the web.
[00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:32.040]   It's not--
[00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:34.400]   So you use your computer as the source,
[00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:37.120]   not something like a Roku player or something like that?
[00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:40.200]   Well, I have a Roku player that I tested out.
[00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:42.200]   I also have-- the other thing I actually do use it quite a bit
[00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:43.920]   is the Xbox because--
[00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:45.360]   It's a good meeting for me too.
[00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:46.920]   It's a good meeting too.
[00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:49.720]   One of the greatest things about the Xbox is you can download
[00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:52.640]   any video format, put it on a USB stick,
[00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:55.000]   plug it into the Xbox and it immediately recognizes it.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   And if it doesn't, it goes and it gets the right format for it.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.760]   And it's a pretty powerful platform.
[00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:01.920]   It's got three power PCs.
[00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:02.960]   So it's interesting.
[00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:07.200]   All three Brooklines use Xboxes for their media device.
[00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:10.320]   And you know what I used to have a dedicated laptop running
[00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:12.200]   mostly boxy full time.
[00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:14.280]   But then actually I loaned that laptop to a friend.
[00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:16.560]   So I'm reduced to Xbox only.
[00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:18.640]   So a lot of Netflix streaming.
[00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:21.240]   I do have a cable service, but I don't--
[00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:23.440]   until very recently, I wasn't actually watching much cable.
[00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:27.160]   I recently decided I'm going to start following British soccer
[00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:28.320]   football leagues.
[00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:30.680]   And so it's helpful to have actual cable to watch
[00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:32.600]   like Fox Sports or ESPN.
[00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:33.120]   How does this--
[00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:35.320]   How does this decision like that happen, Bert?
[00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:36.880]   Man, yeah, really.
[00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:41.000]   The World Cup got me so amped about football.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.480]   These games were rigged, man.
[00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:43.840]   They're rigged.
[00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:45.520]   And just being a part of like a community,
[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:47.840]   I don't know, like English and world football
[00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:49.240]   is really, really exciting.
[00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:50.280]   Oh, no, here we go.
[00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:51.760]   You need one of these, Bert.
[00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:54.760]   So that's why I want you to watch it.
[00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:57.680]   Oh, no, no, I'm not a fan of the movie Zella.
[00:27:57.680 --> 00:27:58.960]   I'm not endorsing that.
[00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:01.520]   You invited him to do that.
[00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:03.160]   That's what you loved about the World Cup.
[00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:04.320]   Admit it.
[00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:06.120]   No, I love that they filtered it.
[00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:07.440]   The networks are filtered.
[00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:09.120]   Oh, they feel-- yeah, they did such a great job.
[00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:11.240]   Notice, though, it sounds more realistic when you have two
[00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:14.000]   of them playing at once than if you just have one.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:14.760]   Please don't do that.
[00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:15.840]   Please don't.
[00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:19.560]   OK, in deference to you, Bert, today.
[00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:20.600]   Play a song on it.
[00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:22.160]   If you can play a song, you can play it.
[00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:23.000]   Why do you even have two?
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.480]   I had three, but I have a friend--
[00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:25.000]   Play taps.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   Play taps.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:26.520]   You can't.
[00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:28.560]   You only can do two notes, two and a half notes.
[00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:30.640]   And it's Scott Wilkinson, who does our home theater.
[00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:34.040]   He's the home theater geek podcast on Twitch.
[00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:36.200]   It plays as a wind instrument player.
[00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:37.640]   He said he could play anything without a read.
[00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:39.160]   Any wind instrument I would have read.
[00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:44.760]   I'll tell you, he plays the shofar, which is a ram's horn.
[00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:45.840]   And he could play that.
[00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:47.480]   And so I sent him one.
[00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:48.240]   And he said, you know what?
[00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:52.880]   It's actually pretty nice because it doesn't cut your lip.
[00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:53.880]   So that's a plus.
[00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:55.080]   That's always a benefit.
[00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:56.040]   That's a plus.
[00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:58.160]   It doesn't cause me to bleed.
[00:28:58.160 --> 00:28:59.280]   There are more of it.
[00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:00.360]   Doris, that's probably--
[00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:03.960]   He says it can only play two, maybe three notes.
[00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:06.400]   Be flat, and then an octave up, and then an octave up.
[00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:09.640]   But I said, well, how come a bugle can play taps?
[00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:12.480]   But he said bugle is much longer than this.
[00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:15.040]   This is too short because a bugle's wrapped around.
[00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:17.680]   So this is-- he says really, it's just--
[00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:19.600]   If it was wrapped around, it would be this--
[00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:20.600]   Right.
[00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:24.600]   It's a measure of how short the vuvuzala is.
[00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:25.440]   Kelly Greeno.
[00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:28.200]   Aren't you glad you asked about that?
[00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:29.640]   I feel bad about that.
[00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:31.720]   But I will say, going through the process,
[00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:34.760]   using the web to help me find an English premiership
[00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:35.960]   league to follow.
[00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:37.440]   I've gotten all through the podcast.
[00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:38.560]   I've met new Twitter friends.
[00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:40.400]   You're an American.
[00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:41.440]   No, he's not.
[00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:43.960]   Take away his passport, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:46.200]   You know, somebody in the chat room pointed something out.
[00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:47.280]   This is amazing.
[00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:49.680]   Hey, Devorak, just remember soccer is more
[00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:51.400]   watched than American football.
[00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:54.480]   Unbelievable.
[00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:56.320]   I don't know.
[00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:57.320]   Actually, I move--
[00:29:57.320 --> 00:29:58.760]   I'm with you, Bex, Bex, Bex, Bex, Bex.
[00:29:58.760 --> 00:29:59.280]   I'm with you.
[00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:00.240]   I watched the World Cup.
[00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:01.080]   I got excited, too.
[00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:01.680]   I wanted more.
[00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:02.520]   I craved more.
[00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:03.520]   Yeah, so I--
[00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:04.760]   Oh, that's amazing.
[00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:08.680]   A bar at 10 in the morning to watch a sport.
[00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:09.760]   Who couldn't you get behind that?
[00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:12.280]   Who couldn't fall asleep is the question I have.
[00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:14.040]   He shoots and nothing happens.
[00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:15.200]   And he goes down to see--
[00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:16.360]   But I'm starting to take us off on that.
[00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:17.120]   I'm really going to go back.
[00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:19.760]   Somebody take a protect story for you.
[00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:23.040]   Actually, I just wanted to say with sports--
[00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:25.680]   so I wrote this piece for the Times a year ago.
[00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:27.680]   It was actually my first ever print story
[00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:28.680]   about "Cancel My Cable."
[00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:31.760]   And it immediately shot up to number one on the most email
[00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:36.440]   list for a week or so and was almost a million views.
[00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:40.720]   And the one thing I said was that you can't get sports
[00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:41.680]   on your computer.
[00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:43.760]   And the way people were doing it for a long time
[00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:45.560]   was actually illegally through Justin TV,
[00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:47.920]   where somebody would broadcast their channel.
[00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:49.360]   But you're still really--
[00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:50.800]   you can get MLB.com.
[00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:54.000]   You can pay $10 a month for that, which is actually pretty good.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.520]   And then you can get ultimate wrestling.
[00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:57.200]   But other than that, you just can't get sports
[00:30:57.200 --> 00:31:00.680]   unless you have cable TV or you go to a bar.
[00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:02.360]   I'd say go to the bar.
[00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:03.880]   I'd say go to the bar, too.
[00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:05.360]   It's a community exit.
[00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:06.360]   So that's interesting.
[00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:08.400]   So it's now become-- here's by the way,
[00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:09.240]   this is pretty exciting.
[00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:09.960]   This is some sports.
[00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:11.720]   This is a dog playing soccer.
[00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:13.080]   This is a soccer playing dog.
[00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:15.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:18.600]   This is the Conicrat entertainment
[00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:20.640]   you can get on TV.
[00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:22.360]   This is more exciting than any soccer I've seen.
[00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:23.360]   Absolutely.
[00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:23.880]   Absolutely.
[00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:25.360]   These guys should bounce off their nose.
[00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:26.960]   They should be much more entertaining.
[00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:28.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:30.040]   I'm sorry.
[00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:31.960]   I've lost completely lost control of this.
[00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:33.680]   You've always lost control.
[00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:36.840]   Next story, let's go to the Google Doc.
[00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:38.040]   And we go to the Google Doc.
[00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:41.440]   So, Nate Thurston, what is our next story?
[00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:42.520]   Our next story coming up.
[00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:48.080]   4chan users crash MPAA website in Pro-piracy protests.
[00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:51.360]   Is this the future of community organizing and protests?
[00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:51.880]   Oh, hell.
[00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:51.880]   Disgusting.
[00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:52.680]   Come on.
[00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:53.680]   First of all--
[00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:54.180]   4chan.
[00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:55.120]   First of 4chan.
[00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:56.640]   You know, don't say anything bad about 4chan.
[00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:57.640]   I love those guys.
[00:31:57.640 --> 00:31:59.880]   You're the funniest guys in the world.
[00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:01.040]   Nobody disses 4chan.
[00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:01.600]   I noticed that.
[00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:03.040]   Oh, you can't take a chance.
[00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:03.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:05.400]   Oh, we love 4chan.
[00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:06.800]   We love you 4chan.
[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:07.800]   You are the best.
[00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:09.160]   You guys are wrong.
[00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:10.680]   But I have to say, I'm just going to say,
[00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:11.800]   that was a big story.
[00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:13.040]   Got a lot of attention.
[00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:17.440]   Can I ask you, who cares if the MPAA site is down?
[00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:18.880]   They're going to keep it down for a day or two.
[00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:21.080]   Is there anybody going there saying, oh, rats?
[00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:22.280]   I can't get to the latest.
[00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:23.760]   I've just done the world a favor.
[00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:24.920]   Yeah, I mean--
[00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:26.520]   It was more symbolic than anything.
[00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:29.440]   It's very symbolic.
[00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:34.680]   Most protests in real life, IRL protests, are symbolic.
[00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:38.120]   But they lead to grabbing enough attention with someone
[00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:40.800]   of power that they pay attention to your group.
[00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:41.280]   Somebody--
[00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:42.200]   I mean, this--
[00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:44.520]   So I don't know if that happened in probably not.
[00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:49.000]   But in the 4chan MPAA case, is there a stage two other than
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   shutting down their website?
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.720]   Or is this just flexing your muscle for 24 or 48 hours?
[00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:56.320]   Is this-- when they say it's the anonymous group on 4chan,
[00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:59.520]   is that the same anonymous that was going after Scientology?
[00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:00.360]   I don't think so.
[00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:01.600]   I don't think it was.
[00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:02.120]   I don't think it was.
[00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:03.560]   So they use this tool--
[00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:04.160]   LOIC.
[00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:06.200]   I can't-- I just always think of Loic and seismic
[00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:07.080]   when I see that.
[00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:08.080]   But I don't think he's behind him.
[00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:09.080]   It's four in a week.
[00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:11.360]   It looks like the low orbit something.
[00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:12.760]   Somebody in the chat room knows this.
[00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:15.960]   Anyway, there's a tool you can get off the source forge.
[00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:18.120]   And one of the comments was like, yeah, this works so well
[00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:20.240]   for the Scientology protests.
[00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:23.440]   Now we're going to take it to the MPAA and the RIAA.
[00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:23.940]   Right.
[00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:24.440]   Etcetera.
[00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:25.080]   What's got to happen?
[00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:25.560]   What's the health--
[00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:27.360]   It's a joke to use.
[00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:29.680]   The low orbit ion cannon?
[00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:31.600]   It's like-- it's freeware.
[00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:32.440]   You just download it.
[00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:34.720]   You type in the URL and point it.
[00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:35.240]   And that's it.
[00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:36.640]   And you just start at DDoS.
[00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:39.640]   And if you get a few thousand people doing that,
[00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:41.920]   it doesn't take long before that website's not going to work.
[00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:43.440]   It's pretty trivial, really.
[00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:44.440]   Yeah.
[00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:47.480]   You don't need to be-- you can be a code kitty to do it.
[00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:49.120]   You don't really need to know anything.
[00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:51.000]   So I'm told that because it's just anonymous
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.040]   is what you're called on 4chan unless you're
[00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:56.800]   one of the one in a million that says who you are on 4chan.
[00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:59.160]   It doesn't-- we can't assume anything.
[00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:01.160]   Well, there's also the anonymous website, which
[00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:07.520]   kind of spun out of that and has a whole different slew of ethics,
[00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:09.960]   should we say.
[00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:12.600]   Like the hacker ethic.
[00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:15.480]   Well, have any of you guys been there to the anonymous website?
[00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:16.800]   Shall I?
[00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:18.320]   Is it dangerous?
[00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:19.520]   You probably looked at the--
[00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:21.920]   You probably looked at it by the FBI late in about an hour.
[00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:22.600]   Coverhand.
[00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:25.760]   And is it anonymous.com?
[00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:28.560]   It's-- is it-- I forget what it is, actually.
[00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:29.200]   Let me see.
[00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:30.840]   Well, I could probably Google an anonymous.
[00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:33.200]   That'll really help.
[00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:34.280]   An anonymous.
[00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:35.280]   Google anonymous.
[00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:36.280]   That didn't help.
[00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:37.040]   Oh, here it is.
[00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:39.800]   Whyweeprotest.net?
[00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:41.480]   No, that's not it.
[00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:42.080]   Let me see here.
[00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:42.840]   This is actually--
[00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:43.240]   Some of these--
[00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:44.880]   There's no official anonymous websites.
[00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:46.840]   This is that anonymous website, which
[00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:49.840]   is the Scientology anonymous.
[00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:53.200]   Not the most distinctive name.
[00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:54.000]   Who is anonymous?
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.080]   Why do we protest?
[00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:58.640]   They've got the V masks, because that's what they wear.
[00:34:58.640 --> 00:34:59.440]   This is bull crap.
[00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:00.440]   This is the real site.
[00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:01.760]   Remember the fifth of November.
[00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:02.280]   No, sir.
[00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:02.800]   You go there.
[00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:04.320]   It looks like an Obama site.
[00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:05.320]   That does.
[00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:07.920]   It's the Obama blue.
[00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:11.600]   Did you see that, by the way, that the reason Facebook is blue
[00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:13.760]   is because Mark Zuckerberg is colorblind,
[00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:15.320]   and it's the only color you could see?
[00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:16.120]   That's bullish.
[00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:17.960]   I mean, I said--
[00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:21.320]   I'll tell you, if I could spend that to a briefly serious,
[00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:25.640]   super serious moment, the idea that a site embodies
[00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:29.440]   the biases, abilities, and beliefs of a single individual--
[00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:30.080]   One man.
[00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:31.760]   --an site so powerful.
[00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:31.760]   Yeah.
[00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:35.640]   500 million people inspired accidentally,
[00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:38.440]   from their perspective, by the limitations or beliefs
[00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:42.160]   or ideas of one person is truly amazing.
[00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:44.800]   I mean, I think it's amazing in the full sense of the word.
[00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:48.160]   As a good thing, as a horrible thing, as just a big thing.
[00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:53.400]   Have you ever heard of a one color-blind type person?
[00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:55.360]   I've never heard of such a thing.
[00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:55.800]   Actually--
[00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:56.960]   One color color, what color?
[00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:58.320]   Somebody go to Wikipedia.
[00:35:58.320 --> 00:35:59.160]   Let's look this up.
[00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:01.760]   So the chatroom has given me the website.
[00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:02.880]   They say, don't go to it.
[00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:04.840]   So I'm going to say what the website is.
[00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:07.960]   But folks do not-- listen to me.
[00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:12.640]   No, no, don't go to it because you could get in trouble.
[00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:15.000]   It's partyvan.info.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:15.400]   There you go.
[00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:15.900]   That's it.
[00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:17.200]   Clearly, I'm going right now.
[00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:17.920]   Don't know.
[00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:18.920]   No.
[00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:22.080]   Be careful, you may see some things that will burn your eyes.
[00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:23.960]   It burns.
[00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:25.200]   It burns.
[00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:26.760]   Partyvan.info.
[00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:27.920]   It's actually pretty boring.
[00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:28.840]   That's not so bad.
[00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:29.360]   That's boring.
[00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:30.720]   Are you criticizing it, Leo?
[00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:32.720]   No, I love Fort Chan.
[00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:34.600]   God bless him.
[00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:37.640]   It may look boring, but what's actually kind of scary--
[00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:39.960]   these are all campaigns that they're putting together.
[00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:41.680]   And what they'll do is someone will say, all right,
[00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:43.720]   let's go and get this person.
[00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:45.360]   And they'll go on there.
[00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:47.360]   And people will just find everything about them
[00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:48.800]   from their home address to their phone number
[00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:50.320]   to their girlfriend.
[00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:52.120]   And it's just put on the site.
[00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:53.720]   So is this the site that was used--
[00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:57.280]   I see it says here right now, Project Target Act.
[00:36:57.280 --> 00:36:58.960]   Is this the site that was used to find
[00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:01.480]   that woman who dumped the puppies or the kittens
[00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:02.360]   or whatever that was?
[00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:04.080]   Is this how they did that?
[00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:04.720]   I'm not sure.
[00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:08.320]   But this was the site I believe that was used.
[00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:09.800]   It's been used for some--
[00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:11.640]   what was the girl in Canada?
[00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:12.200]   Jesse.
[00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:14.160]   In fact, she's still on the front page.
[00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:14.560]   Yeah.
[00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:15.040]   Are we a sheep?
[00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:16.000]   Yeah.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:16.760]   What's it again, party event?
[00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:17.520]   It's a wiki.
[00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:20.640]   So I guess it updates as needed.
[00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:22.320]   Or Jesse.
[00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:23.480]   Yeah, I feel bad for--
[00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:25.040]   I mean, first of all, she has crappy parents,
[00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:27.040]   but now they got the internet on her, too.
[00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:27.880]   Yeah.
[00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:28.880]   Party van--
[00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:30.880]   Back to the theme of--
[00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:31.560]   What's it again, Leo?
[00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:32.560]   --of a party van that was--
[00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:34.080]   It's party van--
[00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:35.480]   You don't know what you're saying.
[00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:37.680]   --partyvan.info, John.
[00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:39.280]   We're finally getting Leo in trouble right now.
[00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:40.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:43.240]   Like Leo, like, batten down the hatches, man, because--
[00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:44.240]   Party van!
[00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:45.320]   --you couldn't go on the front page at that site.
[00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:47.680]   No, they wouldn't go after us, would they?
[00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:48.680]   No.
[00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:50.680]   Have I said that I love--
[00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:51.680]   I mean, I love--
[00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:52.840]   Are we bad about it, though?
[00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:55.360]   Well, when you're on the air, that's what you say.
[00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:57.200]   Shut up, John.
[00:37:57.200 --> 00:37:58.760]   No, I love party van.
[00:37:58.760 --> 00:37:59.960]   Come on, plus--
[00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:03.840]   I want to go back to this idea of technology companies
[00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:05.760]   strongly influenced by a single personality.
[00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:06.280]   Please.
[00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:07.400]   Someone in the camera pointed out--
[00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:07.920]   Please.
[00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:09.760]   --and they're like, well, Steve Jobs is that person--
[00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:10.760]   Yes.
[00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:12.360]   --you know, I can't remember the name of the man who
[00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:13.440]   founded Real Networks.
[00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:14.800]   You brought the site down to me.
[00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:15.800]   --at Amazon.
[00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:16.560]   Time, really?
[00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:17.040]   Shut up.
[00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:20.760]   We often hold up the internet and the web,
[00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:24.640]   it's subset, as this area where anyone can make a difference.
[00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:27.560]   And we all have a say in the future of our world.
[00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:30.000]   But if you look at your Robert Moses' influence
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:32.360]   on New York City, or the Rockefeller's influence
[00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:35.560]   on philanthropy and money, how much
[00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:37.680]   has the world changed in the age of the internet, which
[00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:42.000]   was supposed to empower anyone when the tool that 500 million
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:45.240]   people use is still highly defined just by one person,
[00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:48.400]   when Apple is still heavily micromanaged by Steve Jobs.
[00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:49.320]   Well, I think--
[00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:51.280]   Well, I would submit that there's a difference
[00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:52.400]   between Facebook and Apple.
[00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:54.440]   I think you have a choice whether you're
[00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:56.400]   going to buy or use an Apple product, right?
[00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:56.900]   No.
[00:38:56.900 --> 00:38:58.520]   Well, don't you have a choice whether you use Facebook?
[00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:00.320]   You do, but it's not so much of a choice
[00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:01.560]   because all your friends are on it.
[00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:05.000]   There is this social compulsion component of Facebook
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:06.440]   that's a little different, I think, than Apple.
[00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:09.640]   And that's, I think, where it's scary that Mark has so much
[00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:10.920]   power because if you--
[00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:12.120]   Peer pressure business model, yeah.
[00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:13.640]   Yeah, it's more than even peer pressure.
[00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:16.840]   It's a reason people used AOL and couldn't leave.
[00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:18.080]   It's because this is where you were.
[00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:19.840]   This is where your friends were.
[00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:23.320]   Facebook, I'm convinced if something like Diaspora came along.
[00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:25.600]   I don't think it's got to be Diaspora, but maybe Google
[00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:27.680]   Me came along and offered a choice.
[00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:29.120]   It wouldn't be the issue that it is,
[00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:32.120]   but there isn't a choice right now, is there?
[00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:33.520]   Well, Twitter is the closest thing,
[00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:35.120]   but that actually brings up something else.
[00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:37.920]   I got an email from Twitter today about some new updates,
[00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:39.760]   and this went out to their 150 million people.
[00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:45.040]   And they're talking about a war and you are all rappers
[00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:45.800]   and things like that.
[00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:48.760]   They're not reaching the mainstream audience
[00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:52.480]   that Facebook is because I think it's still programmers
[00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:54.320]   talking to people like their programmers.
[00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:57.040]   What do you think of the new Twitter?
[00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:59.600]   I love new Twitter.
[00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:00.720]   I blog about it.
[00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:01.880]   I turned it off.
[00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:03.720]   I link to Gina's blog about it.
[00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:05.680]   And Gina wrote a nice post on that.
[00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:08.880]   Great post, wonderful, beautiful screenshots.
[00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:11.040]   I'm a fan for a couple of reasons.
[00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:12.400]   I think there's some shortcomings.
[00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:16.280]   They're multiple Twitter windows on your iPhone
[00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:18.480]   and your Android and your iPad on the web,
[00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:20.440]   and they don't all do the same things.
[00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:21.280]   Some support that.
[00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:22.120]   I agree with that.
[00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:22.960]   You do retweets only.
[00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:24.960]   Some don't support old retweets.
[00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:27.040]   Some show you how many retweets you've had.
[00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:27.680]   Others don't.
[00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:30.200]   So they haven't synced the functionality
[00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:32.120]   across all these platforms yet.
[00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:33.120]   But I was--
[00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:34.120]   Are they the user interface?
[00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:37.720]   I love when people do beautiful things on the web
[00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:40.480]   and don't force you to download some proprietary platform
[00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:41.720]   of specific client.
[00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:44.360]   So I saw this as a real win for people
[00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:47.720]   who are fans of the web and not just the internet, people
[00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:49.520]   who are fans of non-apps.
[00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:52.880]   So yeah, I can use keyboard shortcuts to navigate this.
[00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:55.960]   Like in Gmail, that was one of the just of Gina's posts.
[00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:57.120]   And I didn't even know about those.
[00:40:57.120 --> 00:40:58.080]   JK works.
[00:40:58.080 --> 00:40:58.840]   I can't believe it.
[00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:00.160]   That was a beautiful thing.
[00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:03.120]   So the fact that I can move nearly as swiftly
[00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:06.360]   and have these embedded media experiences
[00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:09.200]   through a web browser just reminds everybody, like, yeah,
[00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:11.760]   you guys are all programming specifically
[00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:14.960]   and putting publishers through this burden of upgrading
[00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:17.040]   and sort of itemizing their development plan
[00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:20.720]   for platform A versus B versus Z. When we have this universal
[00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:23.440]   platform called the web and the internet,
[00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:25.000]   that is capable of so much.
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.560]   So I thought there was an investment in a more open platform,
[00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:28.920]   in a more open experience.
[00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:31.320]   And I really do applaud them for that part of it.
[00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:35.280]   Gina, you wrote a great article on Fast Company.com
[00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:37.840]   about the new Twitter page.
[00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:38.520]   You agree?
[00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:39.720]   Why do you like it?
[00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:40.160]   I love it.
[00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:43.400]   I think it's just a beautiful, well-executed web app
[00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:45.160]   that you get in your browser for all the same reasons.
[00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:47.080]   I think they did a really, really nice job
[00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:49.280]   of creating this sort of new--
[00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:51.960]   I think there's this new generation of web apps
[00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:55.440]   that are very influenced by the iPad, actually,
[00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:57.240]   which is kind of ironic.
[00:41:57.240 --> 00:42:00.400]   What that-- the flow, being able to scroll down,
[00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:04.360]   the infinite scroll, the tap and expand panels,
[00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:05.920]   that even the screen resolution you can tell,
[00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:07.360]   it just was-- I don't even have an iPad.
[00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:09.760]   I can tell that the Twitter web app works really well
[00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:10.560]   on the iPad.
[00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:12.840]   And I don't think that we've seen a really innovative web app
[00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:15.760]   since really Gmail and like that.
[00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:17.840]   And when I looked at Twitter, I was really excited about it.
[00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:20.240]   But Alex Payne, who used to work at Twitter,
[00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:22.800]   is no longer there, wrote a great post, which
[00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:24.040]   is in the show notes.
[00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:25.880]   And he noted-- and this is something I hadn't noticed.
[00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:28.480]   He said that he felt like the new Twitter is great,
[00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:31.600]   but that there's a lot of room there for ads.
[00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:34.640]   Yeah, there's a lot of free space where you would smash.
[00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:35.600]   A lot of free space ads.
[00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:36.600]   So that's interesting.
[00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:37.560]   That is interesting.
[00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:39.800]   But I think it really surfaces a lot of metadata
[00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:41.440]   that you get in tweets, the people that
[00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:45.120]   are mentioned, the location, the links that really were hidden
[00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:45.960]   before.
[00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:47.640]   And the keyboard shortcuts are awesome.
[00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:49.520]   Those keyboard shortcuts, I mentioned in my post
[00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:50.360]   that they're like Gmail.
[00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:52.320]   Those actually originated in VI.
[00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:53.720]   And that's why Gmail uses that now.
[00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:54.480]   Oh, no.
[00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:54.920]   It's a--
[00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:55.920]   Absolutely.
[00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:56.920]   It's a big thing.
[00:42:56.920 --> 00:42:59.360]   It's VI, baby.
[00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:02.720]   I'm not such a big fan.
[00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:04.040]   The one thing that's really interesting
[00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:06.920]   is that the search is at the very, very top.
[00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:08.360]   And every time they do a redesign,
[00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:11.120]   the search box gets bigger and more affluent.
[00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:13.320]   And they're becoming a search company.
[00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:14.000]   I mean, they're--
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:15.080]   Yes, they should, by the way.
[00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:16.200]   That's the best part, isn't it?
[00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:17.480]   That's the best part.
[00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:19.320]   Yeah, I mean, that's what you find--
[00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:20.240]   what you find--
[00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:24.120]   All right, I'm going to throw out a curveball then.
[00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:26.920]   I think it's a bad idea because why did Twitter succeed?
[00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:29.240]   In fact, where Twitter's growth is happening, by the way,
[00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:34.120]   almost entirely now is with unsophisticated younger people.
[00:43:34.120 --> 00:43:36.520]   Look at the VH of the Video Music Awards,
[00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:38.840]   the VMAs last weekend going, oh, there's
[00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:41.000]   a million tweets now about Lady Gaga.
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:44.280]   That's what I think that's where most of the new traffic is.
[00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:48.440]   These-- look, we-- maybe not Jon, but we like this new Twitter.
[00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:51.200]   But they're not going to like this new Twitter, you think?
[00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:51.880]   Isn't it--
[00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:53.120]   I don't think they use it.
[00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:54.560]   I mean, I think that--
[00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:56.560]   They're using text?
[00:43:56.560 --> 00:43:57.640]   They're using their Blackberries.
[00:43:57.640 --> 00:43:59.720]   A lot of-- part of the reason that--
[00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:02.000]   I forget where I read this, but part of the reason
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:05.360]   that you're seeing this rise of, if you want to call it,
[00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:08.240]   unsophisticated tweets is because it's partnerships
[00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:10.080]   as Twitter's done with Blackberries and Sprint
[00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:15.000]   and so on where low-income people are getting Blackberries.
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   And it comes on there.
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:19.520]   And it's like a part of the package that they get automatically.
[00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:22.240]   And I think that that's kind of changing things a little bit.
[00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:24.000]   Yeah, I actually had to change the trends
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:27.840]   that I was following from the United States to San Francisco,
[00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:30.960]   because the trends in the United States--
[00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:34.320]   like the number one trend right now on Twitter in the United
[00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:37.680]   States is because I'm a gangsta.
[00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:40.080]   Because we are not the majority on Twitter.
[00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:42.120]   We are no-- well, we used to be.
[00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:43.680]   We're not anymore on our WeGena.
[00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:45.520]   I mean, that happens to every community.
[00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:48.560]   You get super-- every tech community,
[00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:51.480]   but probably every type of community physically as well.
[00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:52.920]   If you're successful, right?
[00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:54.840]   On the web, you get the early tech geeks.
[00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:56.040]   You get the later tech geeks.
[00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:58.120]   You get the people who follow the later tech geeks.
[00:44:58.120 --> 00:44:59.720]   And then you get the population.
[00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:00.840]   You get the country.
[00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:02.840]   And in certain cases, you get the world.
[00:45:02.840 --> 00:45:04.600]   As you get different languages starting to go,
[00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:08.920]   I'm like, oh, this isn't the place that I found that it was like home.
[00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:11.240]   But it's because it's becoming more successful.
[00:45:11.240 --> 00:45:13.240]   And part of the price and success is diversification.
[00:45:13.240 --> 00:45:16.280]   Do we have to get the tech early adopters to start?
[00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:19.160]   And then they get blown away to somewhere else
[00:45:19.160 --> 00:45:20.200]   while the real people come in.
[00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:21.400]   Is that what happens?
[00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:22.840]   That's what happens with every platform.
[00:45:22.840 --> 00:45:24.840]   I mean, look at the tech people that were--
[00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:26.200]   I mean, with the exception of Facebook
[00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:27.880]   where it was a college platform at first.
[00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:31.000]   But I think that's what happens with every platform.
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:32.760]   I mean, you get the nerds that go on there first.
[00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:35.000]   All Twitter's doing right now to me
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:36.840]   is making me feel so out of touch.
[00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:39.080]   I don't know what any of these trending topics are.
[00:45:39.080 --> 00:45:41.160]   And there's no reason for you to have to know.
[00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:43.640]   Larry Johnson, I have a friend interception,
[00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:46.200]   Tae Amo Bieber, Field Bill.
[00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:47.000]   Yeah, Mike.
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:48.760]   Can you tell us why you're a gangster?
[00:45:48.760 --> 00:45:49.640]   I am a gang.
[00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:50.520]   Well, let's see.
[00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:54.440]   OK, let me just click that why I am a gangster and see.
[00:45:54.440 --> 00:45:55.880]   Because I run with Sharp--
[00:45:55.880 --> 00:45:58.520]   Oh, Lady Gaga actually participated in this.
[00:45:58.520 --> 00:46:00.280]   Well, that on the trending topic.
[00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:03.400]   Chat with that on the retweeting Lady Gaga.
[00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:05.680]   Ando's super pants said, I'm a gangster
[00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:08.840]   because I ate Kool-Aid with a spoon straight out of the pack.
[00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:11.400]   Says, Ando's super pants.
[00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:11.800]   These are the--
[00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:13.720]   I'm a gangster because I have a dog named Pixel.
[00:46:13.720 --> 00:46:14.360]   What's up with that?
[00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:15.520]   You are gangster.
[00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:16.520]   You are gangster.
[00:46:16.520 --> 00:46:18.200]   Would you tweet that, Nick built in?
[00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:20.440]   I will tell you what, Nick has a dog named--
[00:46:20.440 --> 00:46:21.960]   what's your cat's name, Nick?
[00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:23.320]   Hip-hop, because she's got three legs,
[00:46:23.320 --> 00:46:25.400]   and she bounces when she walks.
[00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:27.400]   Hip-hop is a gangster.
[00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:29.680]   I know someone was a cat named Pika.
[00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:30.720]   Pika?
[00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:34.600]   And the web designer at the onion, her animals are--
[00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:36.400]   Let me guess, Helvetica?
[00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:38.920]   No, no, but it's M and Dash.
[00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:39.480]   Oh, that's good.
[00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:40.440]   Oh, that's awesome.
[00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:41.240]   Dot and Dash.
[00:46:41.240 --> 00:46:42.760]   That's fantastic.
[00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:43.920]   That is great.
[00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:45.280]   Oh, please.
[00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:46.280]   M-dash.
[00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:48.280]   That's beautiful, dude.
[00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:48.960]   Beautiful.
[00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:50.040]   That's a beautiful thing.
[00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:51.040]   It's a name.
[00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:52.040]   M-dash.
[00:46:52.040 --> 00:46:53.080]   I get it.
[00:46:53.080 --> 00:46:54.320]   Sorry, go ahead.
[00:46:54.320 --> 00:46:56.760]   Back to the Twitter redesign.
[00:46:56.760 --> 00:46:58.680]   One of the things that I noticed that was incredibly
[00:46:58.680 --> 00:47:01.120]   frustrating is with every-- like as Bart's and they said,
[00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:03.760]   with every app and every website that Twitter puts out,
[00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:05.560]   it's got a different UI.
[00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:07.840]   And it's got to be a tremendous amount of work for them
[00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:10.360]   to have an Android, a Blackberry, an iPhone, iPad,
[00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:13.880]   website, mobile site, as we're all trying to do these days.
[00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:16.000]   When are we going to narrow this down?
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:18.400]   Like, when is this going to let up?
[00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:19.000]   That's a good--
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:19.920]   When is what going to let up?
[00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:21.160]   All the third party apps?
[00:47:21.160 --> 00:47:22.200]   No, all the different--
[00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:23.360]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:24.400]   All the different interfaces.
[00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:27.240]   The more you do, the more you log in through device A,
[00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:29.640]   and you get experience 1.
[00:47:29.640 --> 00:47:31.960]   You log in through device B, you get experience 2.
[00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:33.720]   Well, I'm sure this is why--
[00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:36.320]   I'm sure this is why Twitter has taken this huge risk of pissing
[00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:38.920]   off the third party application developers who
[00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:42.760]   made Twitter in the first place and saying,
[00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:44.280]   we'll take it from here, guys.
[00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:46.120]   I mean, that's got to piss them off a little bit.
[00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:48.000]   Here's why I don't like the new Twitter.
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:48.520]   Why, John?
[00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:50.240]   You take up the whole screen.
[00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:52.400]   I don't-- you know, it throws a bunch of crap at me.
[00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:53.520]   I don't want--
[00:47:53.520 --> 00:47:54.920]   I use Twitter casually.
[00:47:54.920 --> 00:47:57.080]   I'm not-- I'm not wed to Twitter like people
[00:47:57.080 --> 00:47:58.800]   who are on Facebook 24/7.
[00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:00.120]   Well, this is what I'm saying--
[00:48:00.120 --> 00:48:00.880]   And that's what this is saying--
[00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:01.520]   This is what I'm saying.
[00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:03.920]   And this is a little bit-- and I'm sure Twitter--
[00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:04.880]   Evan Biz know this.
[00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:08.160]   It's a little bit of a risk to take something that really
[00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:10.840]   succeeded because if it's plain simplicity--
[00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:12.320]   Simplicity, yeah.
[00:48:12.320 --> 00:48:13.640]   And make it so complex.
[00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:17.160]   And I think that they may have been listening a little bit more
[00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:20.600]   to the geeks like us about design and content
[00:48:20.600 --> 00:48:21.840]   than they ought to have.
[00:48:21.840 --> 00:48:22.560]   We'll see.
[00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:23.000]   We'll see.
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:25.000]   I've been wrong about Twitter before.
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:26.520]   I mean, the good news is you don't even
[00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:28.560]   have to expand the panel for Twitter to be useful.
[00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:30.120]   You can just look at the left column
[00:48:30.120 --> 00:48:32.080]   and you still get that plain list of tweets
[00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:33.120]   like that you always got.
[00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:33.720]   Right.
[00:48:33.720 --> 00:48:35.080]   I guess that they did that nicely.
[00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:36.040]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:37.600]   They did kill my wallpaper, though.
[00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:38.480]   I had to like--
[00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:38.880]   They did.
[00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:42.800]   Fastly simplify that because I have about 30 to 60 pixels
[00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:47.760]   of space left on my laptop screen to see non-tweets data
[00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:48.600]   and imagery.
[00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:48.920]   So that was--
[00:48:48.920 --> 00:48:51.720]   That's why my wallpaper is now and has always been,
[00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:55.000]   since day one on Twitter, just a lawn.
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:56.000]   It's just a lawn.
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:57.440]   Yeah, so I could say--
[00:48:57.440 --> 00:49:00.560]   Get off my lawn!
[00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:02.480]   So if I could--
[00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:03.760]   let me know if you mind if I do that.
[00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:05.600]   I'd like to skip to the next tech story.
[00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:07.800]   I'll tell you what, why don't we hold on for a moment
[00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:08.680]   so I can do a commercial?
[00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:11.200]   What is the next tech story going to be, Baratode 3.
[00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:14.000]   We're going to talk about the new Justin TV app.
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:15.080]   Yeah, I don't know anything about this,
[00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:16.360]   but we are on Justin TV.
[00:49:16.360 --> 00:49:18.280]   And I know Nick wrote an article on it.
[00:49:18.280 --> 00:49:20.240]   Yeah, I think Nick will have some fun things to say about this.
[00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:20.920]   All right.
[00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:22.840]   I'm very interested in what's going to happen,
[00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:28.160]   especially since YouTube this week tested streaming as well.
[00:49:28.160 --> 00:49:30.040]   Video streaming is going to-- and something
[00:49:30.040 --> 00:49:32.520]   we've been doing for a couple of years now
[00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:35.600]   is suddenly going to be, I think, a very big deal.
[00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:36.440]   Yeah.
[00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:38.320]   But before we do that, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:41.120]   I'd certainly like to talk about my Fred's at Carbidite
[00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:42.920]   and Chironite Pro.
[00:49:42.920 --> 00:49:43.960]   You do backup.
[00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:44.360]   You do.
[00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:45.840]   You do backup, don't you?
[00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:48.560]   If you're a business, this kind of stuns me.
[00:49:48.560 --> 00:49:53.840]   How many small businesses do not backup their data?
[00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:55.520]   If you're a business, think about what it would mean.
[00:49:55.520 --> 00:49:59.440]   If you're all your data, all your computers got lost,
[00:49:59.440 --> 00:50:01.560]   all your data was gone, how long
[00:50:01.560 --> 00:50:05.280]   would it take you to get back online?
[00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:07.680]   A mighty long time, you might even be out of business
[00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:09.920]   by the time everything got rebuilt.
[00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:13.720]   Where are you going to get that from, the paper spreadsheets?
[00:50:13.720 --> 00:50:16.280]   This is why I think it's so important to have a good backup
[00:50:16.280 --> 00:50:17.960]   strategy, and a good backup strategy
[00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:20.800]   has to have a couple of very important features.
[00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:23.800]   One, I think it's got to be automatic.
[00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:26.120]   If you're not backing up automatically,
[00:50:26.120 --> 00:50:27.440]   it's not going to happen.
[00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:30.960]   You can't trust your employees to always do those backups.
[00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:33.040]   If you are not backing up in the cloud,
[00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:33.800]   you're running a risk.
[00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:37.000]   Because what if the business burns down?
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:38.920]   Carbidite's been used, in fact, by a lot of businesses,
[00:50:38.920 --> 00:50:42.240]   because it's an online automatic backup system
[00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:47.560]   that's very reliable, Windows and Mac, 128-bit SSL,
[00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:50.160]   so it's even on an open access point, it's secure.
[00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:54.520]   Plus, they have AES-256-bit encryption.
[00:50:54.520 --> 00:50:55.960]   In fact, what happened is Carbidite
[00:50:55.960 --> 00:50:59.200]   found that several hundred thousand of its consumer users
[00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:00.520]   were small businesses, and they said, well,
[00:51:00.520 --> 00:51:02.040]   I mean, we ought to do something for business.
[00:51:02.040 --> 00:51:04.000]   That's where Carbidite Pro came from.
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:06.960]   Carbidite Pro, right now for Windows only,
[00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:09.840]   it is a truly amazing solution which we use here.
[00:51:09.840 --> 00:51:12.640]   We looked at all the other ways of doing offsite backup.
[00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:15.080]   There was nothing more affordable, more effective,
[00:51:15.080 --> 00:51:18.560]   or easier to use than Carbidite Pro, I'm very happy to say.
[00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:20.120]   You pay only for the storage you need.
[00:51:20.120 --> 00:51:21.360]   You don't pay for seats.
[00:51:21.360 --> 00:51:23.320]   You can have as many users as you want.
[00:51:23.320 --> 00:51:26.280]   I'll give you, you know, it starts at $10 a month.
[00:51:26.280 --> 00:51:29.000]   That gives you 20 gigabytes of storage.
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:31.680]   If you've got, let's say you've got eight desktops
[00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:34.600]   in your office, small business like mine, eight desktops,
[00:51:34.600 --> 00:51:37.240]   each storing about, I don't know, five gigabytes worth
[00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:41.680]   of storage, that's $25 a month.
[00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:43.200]   Automatic backup.
[00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:44.720]   There's no individual licensing fee.
[00:51:44.720 --> 00:51:45.600]   There's no setup fee.
[00:51:45.600 --> 00:51:48.000]   There's no hardware to buy, no training.
[00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:49.960]   You go around, you put it on all the computers,
[00:51:49.960 --> 00:51:51.080]   they start backing up.
[00:51:51.080 --> 00:51:53.560]   From then on, users can restore their own files
[00:51:53.560 --> 00:51:54.480]   if you set it up that way.
[00:51:54.480 --> 00:51:56.800]   I like that feature.
[00:51:56.800 --> 00:51:57.960]   It's just simple.
[00:51:57.960 --> 00:51:59.320]   You have a centralized dashboard,
[00:51:59.320 --> 00:52:02.040]   so you know exactly which computers are backed up.
[00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:06.080]   Works for Windows XP, Vista, Windows 732, Bit and 64, Bit
[00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:10.520]   Windows Server 2003, 2008 as well.
[00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:12.280]   And I just think this is a great solution.
[00:52:12.280 --> 00:52:13.680]   I want you to try it free for 30 days.
[00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:15.440]   Go to carbonitepro.com.
[00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:17.560]   I'm a big supporter of carbonite.
[00:52:17.560 --> 00:52:21.000]   They just got named the fastest growing IT services company
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:22.840]   in the US for this year.
[00:52:22.840 --> 00:52:25.960]   The ninth fastest overall, it privately held companies overall
[00:52:25.960 --> 00:52:27.080]   in the US.
[00:52:27.080 --> 00:52:28.320]   And there's a reason.
[00:52:28.320 --> 00:52:29.200]   It's good.
[00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:31.640]   Carbonitepro.com, give it a try today.
[00:52:31.640 --> 00:52:36.280]   We thank them so much for their support of This Week in Tech.
[00:52:36.280 --> 00:52:38.120]   What happened to John?
[00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:40.440]   Oh, he went out to try to convince Twitter
[00:52:40.440 --> 00:52:42.720]   to change to the old-- oh wait, my here he comes.
[00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:44.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:52:44.680 --> 00:52:46.400]   I love the idea that he would do that.
[00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:47.200]   He just gets it that's calling.
[00:52:47.200 --> 00:52:49.080]   I got to go get my car going to Twitter.
[00:52:49.080 --> 00:52:50.640]   So I think it's a soma.
[00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:51.640]   Driving on here.
[00:52:51.640 --> 00:52:52.640]   I'm going to--
[00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:53.640]   Wait, wait, wait.
[00:52:53.640 --> 00:52:54.640]   I'm playing up on the end.
[00:52:54.640 --> 00:52:55.640]   I'm playing up on the end.
[00:52:55.640 --> 00:52:56.560]   He got himself a fine--
[00:52:56.560 --> 00:52:58.520]   was an IP-- a screwdriver.
[00:52:58.520 --> 00:52:59.360]   What are you doing there?
[00:52:59.360 --> 00:52:59.920]   What are you doing?
[00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:00.440]   Stop it.
[00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:02.440]   Put that down.
[00:53:02.440 --> 00:53:06.360]   He-- you guys just looks like a fine IPA beer there.
[00:53:06.360 --> 00:53:07.440]   Yeah.
[00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:08.160]   That's good.
[00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:08.600]   We just--
[00:53:08.600 --> 00:53:09.440]   We had to come to the college.
[00:53:09.440 --> 00:53:09.880]   Wait a minute.
[00:53:09.880 --> 00:53:09.880]   Wait a minute.
[00:53:09.880 --> 00:53:11.680]   Weren't we going to open up that layover?
[00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:12.440]   July now.
[00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:13.240]   All right, have a beer.
[00:53:13.240 --> 00:53:13.740]   Yeah.
[00:53:13.740 --> 00:53:15.320]   You got to talk about me on the left.
[00:53:15.320 --> 00:53:18.640]   So we were going to give you cupcakes for your birthday, Gina.
[00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:19.440]   I don't know what happened.
[00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:20.440]   Oh, sorry.
[00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:21.440]   Oh, man.
[00:53:21.440 --> 00:53:25.920]   My house in the cloud, it doesn't street address.
[00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:26.440]   Yeah.
[00:53:26.440 --> 00:53:27.040]   Isn't that funny?
[00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:28.640]   She doesn't have a street address.
[00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:29.320]   Gender this.
[00:53:29.320 --> 00:53:30.320]   Is that in life hacker?
[00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:31.520]   Is that a thing that you set up?
[00:53:31.520 --> 00:53:32.600]   You know, like--
[00:53:32.600 --> 00:53:33.680]   No, I don't have a street address.
[00:53:33.680 --> 00:53:34.920]   I don't even--
[00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:37.480]   Internet personality, personal mailbox.
[00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:38.680]   No, something delivery.
[00:53:38.680 --> 00:53:40.120]   Sorry, guys.
[00:53:40.120 --> 00:53:42.160]   I never give up my street address.
[00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:45.440]   I have a mailbox that's coming called Earth Class Mail,
[00:53:45.440 --> 00:53:46.640]   where you send all your stuff and a scan.
[00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:47.960]   That's smart.
[00:53:47.960 --> 00:53:49.920]   So you can log in from anywhere in the world
[00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:52.680]   and see the outside of the envelope, tell them to scan it.
[00:53:52.680 --> 00:53:55.120]   So I'm going to recycle it, tell them to shred it.
[00:53:55.120 --> 00:53:55.600]   And so--
[00:53:55.600 --> 00:53:56.600]   I trust Leo.
[00:53:56.600 --> 00:53:58.840]   I would totally give Leo my address if I had one.
[00:53:58.840 --> 00:54:00.200]   I just-- I really literally don't.
[00:54:00.200 --> 00:54:01.640]   I think you're making a mistake there, Gina,
[00:54:01.640 --> 00:54:03.320]   because I would, in fact, stalk you.
[00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:04.120]   Yeah, I would be careful.
[00:54:04.120 --> 00:54:05.880]   I actually do have a home, though.
[00:54:05.880 --> 00:54:06.400]   So I don't--
[00:54:06.400 --> 00:54:07.040]   Please, my man.
[00:54:07.040 --> 00:54:08.400]   You know, I'll be honest with you.
[00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:09.280]   We give out the address.
[00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:10.880]   There's people sitting here right now.
[00:54:10.880 --> 00:54:12.520]   I don't know where there's some people from Spain.
[00:54:12.520 --> 00:54:14.040]   They're from people from all over to show up.
[00:54:14.040 --> 00:54:15.720]   There's two people from the CIA sitting over here.
[00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:16.960]   CIA sitting over here.
[00:54:16.960 --> 00:54:18.280]   And there's some far-channed guys
[00:54:18.280 --> 00:54:19.280]   picketing out front.
[00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:22.720]   So I live without fear.
[00:54:22.720 --> 00:54:24.240]   I feel that that is--
[00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:25.560]   I give up my street address.
[00:54:25.560 --> 00:54:27.720]   I have a three-legged cat named hip hop
[00:54:27.720 --> 00:54:29.600]   who's packing heat because I'm a gangster.
[00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:30.960]   He's a gangster.
[00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:33.080]   He's going to get a laugh at that three-legged cat thing
[00:54:33.080 --> 00:54:34.880]   of his last thing he does.
[00:54:34.880 --> 00:54:38.400]   You know, he hops because he only has three legs.
[00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:39.960]   So I'm getting it.
[00:54:39.960 --> 00:54:41.040]   Yeah.
[00:54:41.040 --> 00:54:42.040]   Get it?
[00:54:42.040 --> 00:54:42.920]   He's going-- wait a minute.
[00:54:42.920 --> 00:54:43.920]   We just mixed it.
[00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:44.840]   Go do that some more.
[00:54:44.840 --> 00:54:46.320]   Nick, you were dancing.
[00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:47.040]   And we missed it.
[00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:49.440]   I was hopping.
[00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:50.280]   There he goes.
[00:54:50.280 --> 00:54:51.360]   Because I'm a gangster.
[00:54:51.360 --> 00:54:52.160]   That's the sound I roll.
[00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:53.680]   Gangster.
[00:54:53.680 --> 00:54:54.760]   Gangster.
[00:54:54.760 --> 00:54:56.760]   All right, so back to the juggle speed.
[00:54:56.760 --> 00:54:58.280]   Story.
[00:54:58.280 --> 00:54:59.880]   Yes.
[00:54:59.880 --> 00:55:00.880]   So they--
[00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:02.040]   Do you want to set this up, Nick?
[00:55:02.040 --> 00:55:05.160]   So are you guys all familiar with how it all started?
[00:55:05.160 --> 00:55:06.240]   I'm sure, right?
[00:55:06.240 --> 00:55:06.600]   Yeah.
[00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:08.240]   In fact, we're on Justin TV right now.
[00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:11.240]   If you go to live.twit.tv while we use three different services,
[00:55:11.240 --> 00:55:12.880]   the front page is Justin.tv.
[00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:14.880]   I was wondering how the cat lost its leg.
[00:55:14.880 --> 00:55:16.200]   Oh, stop it.
[00:55:16.200 --> 00:55:17.400]   It was born that way, John.
[00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:20.160]   It had an accident with a screwdriver.
[00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:23.160]   It's actually like these differently-abled jelly
[00:55:23.160 --> 00:55:24.640]   beans I have here.
[00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:26.840]   The belly flops, they call them.
[00:55:26.840 --> 00:55:29.080]   Are you doing dental work on the show?
[00:55:29.080 --> 00:55:30.680]   Should never.
[00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:32.720]   So Nick, yeah, so started with some guy--
[00:55:32.720 --> 00:55:33.400]   was it Justin?
[00:55:33.400 --> 00:55:35.760]   He was like, he wore a camera all the time.
[00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:38.040]   Yeah, he used to wear the camera constantly.
[00:55:38.040 --> 00:55:42.720]   He used to have a Sony laptop and is one of those super thin ones
[00:55:42.720 --> 00:55:43.480]   in his backpack.
[00:55:43.480 --> 00:55:45.240]   And then he had a little camera on his hat,
[00:55:45.240 --> 00:55:48.800]   and any videotaped everything, and some pretty mundane things
[00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:50.400]   that you probably wouldn't want to watch.
[00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:51.920]   And then there was the pranks, too,
[00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:53.360]   when people were trying to mess with him.
[00:55:53.360 --> 00:55:57.320]   And they sent parties and the cops to a pizza, sorry,
[00:55:57.320 --> 00:56:00.240]   and the cops to a party and things like that.
[00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:02.720]   But then what's happened really recently, which is fascinating,
[00:56:02.720 --> 00:56:06.720]   with Justin TV, is they've been trying to fight piracy.
[00:56:06.720 --> 00:56:08.160]   And what you have is, because there's
[00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:11.600]   no live TV on the web yet, and everyone's still working that out,
[00:56:11.600 --> 00:56:15.720]   is that people will stream the VMAs and the Emmys and sports
[00:56:15.720 --> 00:56:16.080]   shows.
[00:56:16.080 --> 00:56:18.080]   And it's become almost like a game of whack-a-mole
[00:56:18.080 --> 00:56:21.640]   for the Justin TV guys, where they have to try to put these shows
[00:56:21.640 --> 00:56:23.280]   out before they rise up.
[00:56:23.280 --> 00:56:24.240]   Really?
[00:56:24.240 --> 00:56:25.320]   I don't want to interrupt you.
[00:56:25.320 --> 00:56:27.840]   With every Mysby, I think there was some guy--
[00:56:27.840 --> 00:56:29.120]   I can't remember who it was, but he was
[00:56:29.120 --> 00:56:31.240]   at one of the Apple announcements.
[00:56:31.240 --> 00:56:33.840]   And he had his laptop, and he was shooting pictures
[00:56:33.840 --> 00:56:35.240]   of the Apple announcement.
[00:56:35.240 --> 00:56:36.680]   And the next thing you know, they threw him out.
[00:56:36.680 --> 00:56:37.960]   They did not throw me out.
[00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:39.000]   Oh, it's you.
[00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:40.560]   And it wasn't illegal.
[00:56:40.560 --> 00:56:42.640]   There was nobody said not to do it.
[00:56:42.640 --> 00:56:44.280]   There's no sign that didn't say it said--
[00:56:44.280 --> 00:56:45.280]   You bet black bald.
[00:56:45.280 --> 00:56:47.360]   Well, there were cameras.
[00:56:47.360 --> 00:56:50.000]   There was a row of cameras behind me doing it.
[00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:51.280]   So I thought, well, what the hell?
[00:56:51.280 --> 00:56:52.160]   How about my laptop?
[00:56:52.160 --> 00:56:53.920]   And now I can't get invited to an Apple event
[00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:55.280]   to save my life.
[00:56:55.280 --> 00:56:56.680]   Who cares?
[00:56:56.680 --> 00:56:57.320]   Go ahead, Nick.
[00:56:57.320 --> 00:56:57.680]   Forget it.
[00:56:57.680 --> 00:56:58.960]   Send Steve Jobs some cupcakes.
[00:56:58.960 --> 00:57:00.080]   Maybe that'll solve it.
[00:57:00.080 --> 00:57:00.880]   No, no.
[00:57:00.880 --> 00:57:03.400]   I think he would be solved by Nick getting on the case
[00:57:03.400 --> 00:57:04.880]   and writing it up in the New York Times.
[00:57:04.880 --> 00:57:06.160]   Steve is an Aritarian.
[00:57:06.160 --> 00:57:07.320]   He only eats air.
[00:57:07.320 --> 00:57:09.560]   He doesn't eat food.
[00:57:09.560 --> 00:57:14.200]   So now we have the Justin TV mobile app.
[00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:17.200]   So they launched the Android app, I think about a month ago.
[00:57:17.200 --> 00:57:20.280]   And they finally launched the iPhone app.
[00:57:20.280 --> 00:57:23.280]   And they're really trying to encourage people to broadcast live.
[00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:25.000]   But Nick, doesn't everybody do this?
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:27.360]   Doesn't you stream do this?
[00:57:27.360 --> 00:57:29.080]   I mean, everybody does this, right?
[00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:29.720]   Yeah, they do.
[00:57:29.720 --> 00:57:31.560]   I think what Justin TV is trying to take advantage of
[00:57:31.560 --> 00:57:33.040]   is the current community they have, right?
[00:57:33.040 --> 00:57:34.320]   So people like you that are--
[00:57:34.320 --> 00:57:34.840]   Wait a minute.
[00:57:34.840 --> 00:57:36.360]   Look, there we are on the front page.
[00:57:36.360 --> 00:57:37.640]   Look who's on the front page.
[00:57:37.640 --> 00:57:39.280]   It's Nick, Bill.
[00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:40.800]   Nick, Bill, talking about--
[00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:41.040]   I'm talking about--
[00:57:41.040 --> 00:57:43.440]   --the camera back on me.
[00:57:43.440 --> 00:57:44.520]   That's cool, Nick.
[00:57:44.520 --> 00:57:45.600]   You're a star.
[00:57:45.600 --> 00:57:48.000]   Looks just like you.
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:50.000]   I don't know what you say.
[00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:51.720]   You don't know how to get dressed.
[00:57:51.720 --> 00:57:53.160]   Soo the star.
[00:57:53.160 --> 00:57:54.520]   What this is that--
[00:57:54.520 --> 00:57:55.960]   --he could jean on it, please.
[00:57:55.960 --> 00:57:57.320]   Put a pretty face on.
[00:57:57.320 --> 00:57:59.640]   Yeah, nobody's going to be honest with you.
[00:57:59.640 --> 00:58:01.320]   OK, here's the things you can choose from.
[00:58:01.320 --> 00:58:02.240]   I'm going to pick my gun, Matt.
[00:58:02.240 --> 00:58:09.800]   Mudtruck TV, Funkwares, Project Leat, X4i, Usai, or Nick.
[00:58:09.800 --> 00:58:11.800]   Who just says it's a trick underneath.
[00:58:11.800 --> 00:58:13.520]   It's a picture of Nick.
[00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:14.360]   Nick, I assume.
[00:58:14.360 --> 00:58:17.160]   Nick, I really-- if I were you, I would use that as your avatar,
[00:58:17.160 --> 00:58:18.040]   including the Twit part.
[00:58:18.040 --> 00:58:19.920]   Twit.
[00:58:19.920 --> 00:58:20.440]   Right there.
[00:58:20.440 --> 00:58:21.200]   That looks good.
[00:58:21.200 --> 00:58:22.320]   That's terrible.
[00:58:22.320 --> 00:58:25.800]   That said, I'm going to do it for a week on the new Twitter.
[00:58:25.800 --> 00:58:26.280]   I'm sorry.
[00:58:26.280 --> 00:58:29.640]   We've been really, really rude to you and Barrett today.
[00:58:29.640 --> 00:58:30.280]   Of course.
[00:58:30.280 --> 00:58:33.000]   So go ahead and please continue.
[00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:36.200]   So well, the thing that's interesting-- so, OK, so they--
[00:58:36.200 --> 00:58:37.720]   people have been doing this Ustream, so on.
[00:58:37.720 --> 00:58:41.200]   And we've seen Scoville run around with cameras streaming
[00:58:41.200 --> 00:58:44.480]   everything, birthday parties, tech events.
[00:58:44.480 --> 00:58:46.760]   But I think the thing that Justin's trying to take advantage
[00:58:46.760 --> 00:58:48.280]   of is the community.
[00:58:48.280 --> 00:58:49.760]   But what I think is really fascinating
[00:58:49.760 --> 00:58:52.160]   is it's going to bring up a whole slew of copyright questions
[00:58:52.160 --> 00:58:53.720]   as more companies do this.
[00:58:53.720 --> 00:58:55.720]   Because let's just say that, of course, I
[00:58:55.720 --> 00:58:57.320]   can't stream directly to the VMAs,
[00:58:57.320 --> 00:59:00.360]   but let's just say that Bartunde is standing next to my TV.
[00:59:00.360 --> 00:59:01.320]   And the VMAs are on.
[00:59:01.320 --> 00:59:03.280]   What's the rule there?
[00:59:03.280 --> 00:59:06.000]   This has come up in a number of situations.
[00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:09.040]   Remember athletes were instructed during the Olympics,
[00:59:09.040 --> 00:59:11.960]   the Winter Olympics in Vancouver to be very careful
[00:59:11.960 --> 00:59:13.440]   about tweeting results.
[00:59:13.440 --> 00:59:16.600]   It's certainly not streaming video, even from behind the scenes.
[00:59:16.600 --> 00:59:19.280]   Because the rights to this had been sold.
[00:59:19.280 --> 00:59:24.080]   And even an Justin TV backstage stream is an infringement.
[00:59:24.080 --> 00:59:26.360]   I think-- you ask me?
[00:59:26.360 --> 00:59:27.680]   Fantastic.
[00:59:27.680 --> 00:59:30.920]   It breaks down the whole-- it breaks down the whole CD
[00:59:30.920 --> 00:59:33.800]   structure of backroom deals.
[00:59:33.800 --> 00:59:35.320]   It opens up everything to the public.
[00:59:35.320 --> 00:59:36.440]   So breath of fresh air.
[00:59:36.440 --> 00:59:39.280]   And this is why I love doing what we do.
[00:59:39.280 --> 00:59:42.280]   Now, do you think Justin will be shut down by people
[00:59:42.280 --> 00:59:46.640]   who don't like it, that this ability to stream via phone
[00:59:46.640 --> 00:59:48.840]   is in everybody's pocket?
[00:59:48.840 --> 00:59:49.520]   I don't know.
[00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:50.200]   It's a great question.
[00:59:50.200 --> 00:59:52.720]   I mean, it brings up so many interesting questions around--
[00:59:52.720 --> 00:59:54.320]   I mean, one of the things with--
[00:59:54.320 --> 00:59:57.080]   so I have a chapter in my book about the next 10 years.
[00:59:57.080 --> 00:59:59.960]   And I spoke to all these cyborgs.
[00:59:59.960 --> 01:00:01.920]   And I said, and these are people that are literally reporting.
[01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:03.120]   I'm sorry, can you clarify that?
[01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:03.920]   Cyborg?
[01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:05.120]   Cyborgs.
[01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:06.040]   Yeah, like--
[01:00:06.040 --> 01:00:06.520]   Cyborgs.
[01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:09.400]   We do not like to be called cyborgs.
[01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:10.920]   We prefer little people.
[01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:13.440]   Who are cyborgs?
[01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:14.960]   People walking around with cameras on their head?
[01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:15.480]   Yes.
[01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:18.200]   Do you speak to a T-888 or a C-1000?
[01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:19.200]   Like, what does that mean?
[01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:20.560]   T-1000.
[01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:21.960]   Like a real deal cyborg.
[01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:23.880]   So you've got-- it's just Steve Mann, right?
[01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:26.160]   So he's got-- he records.
[01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:28.080]   He's got these glasses that record everything.
[01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:29.760]   He's got like wires plugged into his head.
[01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:32.560]   He's got a little waste computer.
[01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:34.440]   You know what the problem, though, Nick, I got to tell you,
[01:00:34.440 --> 01:00:37.200]   that's boring as we learn from Justin.
[01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:39.160]   Yeah, just as moved on.
[01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:41.800]   Well, the thing that freaked me out about the whole encounter
[01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:44.080]   with Steve was that he--
[01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:45.080]   I was being recorded, right?
[01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:46.800]   And the only way to not be recorded
[01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:48.080]   was to run in the other direction.
[01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:48.440]   Right.
[01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:49.440]   Well, that's interesting.
[01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:50.640]   You can punch him out.
[01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:51.880]   No, that's interesting.
[01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:53.720]   And then that would be recorded.
[01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:54.800]   Somebody will point out--
[01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:56.000]   I'm going to get you a point under the groin before he
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:57.680]   does anything, and then you can deny all of that.
[01:00:57.680 --> 01:00:59.080]   We have viewers in England who point out
[01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:00.880]   that you can't walk downtown in London
[01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:02.800]   without being recorded in multiple cases.
[01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:04.560]   Yeah, the CCTV's over there.
[01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:06.360]   Hey, they're all over New York, too.
[01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:08.000]   Welcome to the modern world.
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.600]   You know, I mean, we've seen movies
[01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:12.200]   where there's a guy watching every street corner.
[01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:13.160]   I think that that's just--
[01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:15.320]   you know, that's practically here.
[01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:15.800]   But you're right.
[01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:18.320]   I mean, if I walk in the room, as I have--
[01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:20.160]   by the way, I've done this, Nick--
[01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:21.760]   not as a cyborg, but to cover stuff,
[01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:23.200]   I walk in the room with cameras in there.
[01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:25.800]   You definitely get a mix of reactions.
[01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:27.000]   Oh, yeah, I tried to interview--
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:28.160]   I mean, I try to interview people
[01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:29.480]   with a video camera certain times,
[01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:32.160]   and they get freaked out, but with a tape recorder,
[01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:32.600]   they're fine.
[01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:34.280]   But maybe that's generational.
[01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:35.880]   It'll change in the next few years.
[01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:37.840]   But I think what's scary for me--
[01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:40.480]   and I'm all for the internet in the future,
[01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:43.120]   and I'm extremely positive about everything
[01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:46.080]   as I've written in my book and on the Times blog.
[01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:50.280]   But the fact that you can't delete that, once I spoke
[01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:52.160]   to Steve Mann, that was it.
[01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:53.440]   It was there that I spoke to him.
[01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:55.600]   There was no way for me to take that away.
[01:01:55.600 --> 01:01:57.280]   Don't speak to him anymore.
[01:01:57.280 --> 01:01:58.360]   Don't speak to him anymore.
[01:01:58.360 --> 01:01:58.920]   Exactly.
[01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:01.560]   But now when you get these Justin TV apps and things like that,
[01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:03.560]   I think it brings up interesting questions.
[01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:06.080]   Can I call up Justin TV and say, hey, I showed up
[01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:06.800]   on one of your cameras.
[01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:07.480]   Can you take me off?
[01:02:07.480 --> 01:02:08.760]   No.
[01:02:08.760 --> 01:02:09.440]   It's there.
[01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:10.280]   Google does that.
[01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:12.440]   They'll let you take an expert gate, certain things
[01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:15.160]   that they've recorded by their Beatles.
[01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:19.840]   Once you walk around in the world with a camera, and a light,
[01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:24.120]   and a tripod, and a staff, and you visit people with this thing,
[01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:26.560]   you really see-- we went-- I went backstage with a camera
[01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:30.880]   like this at Dignation, South by Southwest this past spring.
[01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:32.280]   And it is very interesting to see.
[01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:34.840]   And these are savvy, media-savvy young people
[01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:36.080]   to see the reaction.
[01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:38.160]   The security guard really hated it.
[01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:38.960]   Oh, I bet he didn't.
[01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:39.960]   He really hated it.
[01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:40.640]   He was moonlighting.
[01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:41.800]   He probably wasn't allowed to.
[01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:42.880]   Oh, yeah, maybe.
[01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:43.760]   I didn't think of that.
[01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:46.160]   That's why they don't let you record stuff in Vegas.
[01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:48.720]   Drop into one of the casinos and wander around--
[01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:49.720]   Oh, you can't do that.
[01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:51.440]   And you learn very quickly what you can do,
[01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:52.280]   and what you can't do.
[01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:54.520]   What happens in Vegas is supposed to stay there,
[01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:55.760]   but not with live streaming.
[01:02:55.760 --> 01:02:56.360]   Right.
[01:02:56.360 --> 01:02:56.840]   Yeah.
[01:02:56.840 --> 01:02:57.560]   They go somewhere with it.
[01:02:57.560 --> 01:02:59.480]   The Chargers game was blacked out here in San Diego,
[01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:01.040]   and people were really upset this weekend.
[01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:04.120]   And one of the things that the local news actually recommended
[01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:08.200]   was pointing a Skype video camera at the game.
[01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:08.680]   What?
[01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:09.200]   People were like, what?
[01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:09.720]   Really?
[01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:10.200]   Yeah.
[01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:10.720]   Yeah.
[01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:12.040]   Like on the local news, they were like, well,
[01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:13.400]   you know if you know-- because it was blacked out
[01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:14.520]   with it at a 75 mile radius.
[01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:16.760]   Or it's like if you know somebody in the outer county,
[01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:19.200]   have them turn on the game and then point their eyesight
[01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:20.800]   at the game and Skype them.
[01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:22.000]   That's awesome.
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:23.040]   Isn't that so funny?
[01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:24.720]   And I think sitesite.justintv kind
[01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:26.840]   of let people do the same thing for sports events
[01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:29.000]   and blacked out content.
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.880]   And how do you-- well, I suppose in the case of Justin TV,
[01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:33.520]   it's easy to get that stuff pulled, right?
[01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:36.960]   But in a case of a private Skype video call--
[01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:37.880]   You can't?
[01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:39.840]   I tell you, you go to a rock concert these days
[01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:42.280]   and everybody's got their phone held up,
[01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:44.920]   either playing the music to their friends, which
[01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:46.360]   can't sound very good.
[01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:46.840]   Or video--
[01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:48.960]   Neither can the video can't look very good either.
[01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:50.440]   But we're getting better and better.
[01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:52.800]   It's hard-- I mean, look at this iPhone 4 probably
[01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:55.840]   does a pretty good video and streams pretty well on Justin
[01:03:55.840 --> 01:03:56.320]   TV.
[01:03:56.320 --> 01:03:59.000]   I think we're getting very close to high def
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:00.800]   in everybody's pocket all the time.
[01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:02.680]   Have you seen the video, by the way,
[01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:06.720]   of Walt Mossberg playing "Chatt Roulette" as a puppet?
[01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:08.000]   Yeah.
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:09.200]   No, I'm asking Mr. Mossberg.
[01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:10.240]   I'm wondering.
[01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:11.840]   It's not the Walt Mossberg.
[01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:12.560]   Oh, it's the puppet.
[01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:14.240]   It's Walt Moss puppet.
[01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:15.600]   There is a difference.
[01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:17.560]   That's Brian Hogg who actually does a parody.
[01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:19.880]   Oh, I thought that was Walt Mossberg, to be honest about it.
[01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:20.200]   Really?
[01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:20.640]   Did you really?
[01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:22.560]   Uh-huh.
[01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:23.880]   You've seen my puppet.
[01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:25.720]   Yeah, you've got a puppet back there.
[01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:26.400]   I have a puppet.
[01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:26.840]   Yeah.
[01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:29.480]   That same guy, Brian built that one.
[01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:30.480]   I could touch it.
[01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:32.400]   That looks a lot like Scoble.
[01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:35.040]   Nick, I mean, this is obviously what's happening.
[01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:35.440]   Yes.
[01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:38.880]   And I think that it's one of those things that--
[01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:43.640]   I'll tell you what, I have a really interesting challenge
[01:04:43.640 --> 01:04:44.360]   with this show.
[01:04:44.360 --> 01:04:47.400]   Last week, for instance, we were talking about Tina Fey
[01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:48.800]   and Justin Bieber.
[01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:50.760]   And I ran-- it's a news show.
[01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:53.920]   I ran a small clip from Saturday Night Live off YouTube
[01:04:53.920 --> 01:04:56.800]   of Tina Fey and Justin Bieber.
[01:04:56.800 --> 01:04:59.800]   We posted that show on YouTube this week.
[01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:03.280]   And it was pulled YouTube's automatic content discovery
[01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:05.920]   system flagged it as a copyright violation.
[01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:07.320]   It was a fair use.
[01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:09.040]   I believe it's fair use.
[01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:10.600]   There is-- in fact, we have an article,
[01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:14.120]   if you look on the rundown about this.
[01:05:14.120 --> 01:05:16.560]   There is a process, but it's not a very good process.
[01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:17.880]   We've talked to our lawyers.
[01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:19.360]   I don't know exactly what to do about it.
[01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:20.320]   How many lawyers do you have?
[01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:21.120]   So here's a--
[01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:21.600]   Yes, sir.
[01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:25.200]   This is a perfect segue, Leo, to another story in our queue.
[01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:26.600]   Hooray.
[01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:29.040]   From codinghorrors.com.
[01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:30.320]   That's it.
[01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:33.280]   We have a great story about the title
[01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:36.440]   is YouTube versus fair use.
[01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:39.680]   And essentially, this blog is a really interesting job
[01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:43.240]   of sort of documenting when YouTube got popular.
[01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:46.320]   A lot of it was on the backs of copyrighted material.
[01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:48.800]   And they said, look, we have a lot of legitimate material
[01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:49.320]   as well.
[01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:51.160]   So you can't shut us down completely.
[01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:53.840]   But they also promised two copyright holders
[01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:56.040]   that they would be working on a solution.
[01:05:56.040 --> 01:05:57.240]   And they did.
[01:05:57.240 --> 01:05:59.880]   And they released a system called Content ID, which
[01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:04.160]   allows them to very quickly identify via audio or video
[01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:07.880]   or both when someone else's work is being uploaded
[01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:09.040]   by a random user.
[01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:11.840]   And then the publisher has the choice of, you know,
[01:06:11.840 --> 01:06:15.800]   block it altogether, track it to just get usage stats
[01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:17.280]   or to monetize it.
[01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:18.720]   But this writer who was--
[01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:19.880]   I can't get his name off the side.
[01:06:19.880 --> 01:06:21.000]   She's a coding horse.
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:21.200]   Jeff--
[01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:21.200]   Jeff--
[01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:21.700]   Jeff--
[01:06:21.700 --> 01:06:22.200]   Jeff would--
[01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:22.560]   Yeah, Gina--
[01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:23.040]   Jeff--
[01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:26.680]   Jeff was writing in detail about, you know, first of all,
[01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:28.200]   he didn't think they could actually build it.
[01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:31.160]   He thought that they were just like a delay tactic for the courts
[01:06:31.160 --> 01:06:32.560]   to like, yeah, yeah, we'll monitor this.
[01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:33.480]   We'll give you reports.
[01:06:33.480 --> 01:06:35.320]   Blah, blah, blah, yada, yada, yada.
[01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:36.960]   But it turns out that it works.
[01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:39.440]   And so within an hour of posting something,
[01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:41.680]   you'll find, you know, as a YouTube user,
[01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:44.160]   that they flag your stuff and have warned you
[01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:45.800]   that you need to take this down.
[01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:47.440]   So you found that out, Leo.
[01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:48.760]   I mean, you got-- you know, we talked about this
[01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:50.040]   with the onion a couple of months ago.
[01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:50.400]   That's right.
[01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:51.840]   Same thing happened with the onion.
[01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:53.200]   And that wasn't your--
[01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:54.080]   That wasn't your choice.
[01:06:54.080 --> 01:06:55.440]   That wasn't the onion's choice, right?
[01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:57.000]   And we didn't-- you know, we weren't-- you know,
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:58.560]   it's a YouTube system where they were like,
[01:06:58.560 --> 01:07:00.440]   we're going to go out of our way to be friendly
[01:07:00.440 --> 01:07:03.680]   to copyright holders and send warnings to users.
[01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:05.600]   And hopefully, they'll meet in the middle of somewhere
[01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:06.880]   that isn't too onerous.
[01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:10.120]   But like, you know, Gina, you're this week in Google.
[01:07:10.120 --> 01:07:14.120]   Like, what do you think about the fair use versus YouTube?
[01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:15.840]   I mean, YouTube's supposed to liberate all of us,
[01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:19.240]   but it also seems to be shackling us with maybe a mild bit
[01:07:19.240 --> 01:07:22.160]   of overreach in terms of the fair use implications
[01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:25.000]   of clipping audio and video?
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.040]   I'm kind of amazed that they actually made the system that
[01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:28.560]   does this so quickly.
[01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:29.880]   We're talking about Napster.
[01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:31.800]   Napster was told by the courts.
[01:07:31.800 --> 01:07:33.760]   This goes way back to Napster.
[01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:36.240]   They were told by the court, you need to come up
[01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:39.120]   with a way to flag copyrighted content.
[01:07:39.120 --> 01:07:42.120]   And Napster's defense was, it can't be done.
[01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:42.800]   YouTube's done it.
[01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:44.520]   I thought, of course, Google did it, right?
[01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:48.200]   So when you file the dispute, how long
[01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:49.800]   is the response to the dispute?
[01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:52.520]   I don't know, because we haven't heard yet.
[01:07:52.520 --> 01:07:56.160]   The onion thing, so here's the deal.
[01:07:56.160 --> 01:07:59.080]   The content flagging happens automatically.
[01:07:59.080 --> 01:07:59.480]   Right.
[01:07:59.480 --> 01:08:00.320]   That's just done.
[01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:03.160]   And then as you said, Baratunde, the copyright holders
[01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:04.280]   have three choices.
[01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:06.280]   I don't think the one with the onion was pulled down.
[01:08:06.280 --> 01:08:06.880]   Was it, John?
[01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:08.320]   I don't think that one was pulled down.
[01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:10.440]   I mean, we wouldn't set, you know,
[01:08:10.440 --> 01:08:13.200]   and for those who are just tuning in, we didn't get this.
[01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:17.240]   So my job there is as web editor, digital dude.
[01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:19.480]   So in theory, I'm supposed to know about these things,
[01:08:19.480 --> 01:08:21.400]   but there's a lot of stuff that happens in the world.
[01:08:21.400 --> 01:08:24.280]   But in general, we wouldn't have a default setting of--
[01:08:24.280 --> 01:08:25.080]   Right.
[01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:26.680]   --block you from citing us.
[01:08:26.680 --> 01:08:28.000]   No, it's just good publicity.
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:28.640]   I ran a show of--
[01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:30.040]   The original "The O'Rainsments of the Onion"
[01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:32.160]   is not to stop people from talking about it.
[01:08:32.160 --> 01:08:33.360]   So it doesn't make a lot of sense.
[01:08:33.360 --> 01:08:34.920]   And it drives traffic.
[01:08:34.920 --> 01:08:38.640]   It'd be the track or the monetize or book.
[01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:39.520]   So in that case, it wasn't.
[01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:44.440]   Obviously, NBC has a blanket setting saying, yank it.
[01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:45.520]   And we got yanked immediately.
[01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:47.320]   I don't know if we've appealed.
[01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:53.480]   I think my attitude is I want to appeal as a news organization.
[01:08:53.480 --> 01:08:55.480]   Now, maybe there's some debate over what
[01:08:55.480 --> 01:08:58.600]   a news organization could do in this coding horror blog.
[01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:01.240]   He does talk about the three tests for fair use,
[01:09:01.240 --> 01:09:06.400]   all of which I believe we satisfy.
[01:09:06.400 --> 01:09:08.160]   Why don't you read them so people know?
[01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:09.400]   Do you have them in front of you, Beritunde?
[01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:10.880]   Because I don't.
[01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:12.240]   Yeah, he asked four questions.
[01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:13.240]   I have them.
[01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:13.760]   OK.
[01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:15.280]   Is the use transformative?
[01:09:15.280 --> 01:09:18.080]   Is the source material intended for the public good?
[01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:19.320]   How much was taken?
[01:09:19.320 --> 01:09:20.680]   And what's the market effect?
[01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:22.720]   Those are the four questions that Jeff
[01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:24.880]   at with this programmer outlines.
[01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:28.320]   He has to meet one or four.
[01:09:28.320 --> 01:09:28.760]   I'm sorry?
[01:09:28.760 --> 01:09:30.160]   Do you have to meet one or four?
[01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:34.120]   He says four guidelines.
[01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:35.920]   So I think all four.
[01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:37.680]   The court would look at those.
[01:09:37.680 --> 01:09:38.600]   Yeah, I would say.
[01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:40.120]   Was the use transformative in the sense
[01:09:40.120 --> 01:09:42.880]   that we change it in a way so that it's not the same?
[01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:43.440]   No, no.
[01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:45.160]   I think transformative in this case
[01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:47.280]   because I've heard this lecture a million times.
[01:09:47.280 --> 01:09:49.840]   It means that you're using it for a different purpose.
[01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:51.640]   You've transformed the reason for it.
[01:09:51.640 --> 01:09:54.560]   Use in other words, you're mocking it or something.
[01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:55.840]   Or we're doing use coverage.
[01:09:55.840 --> 01:09:58.080]   You're not merely rebroadcasting.
[01:09:58.080 --> 01:09:58.920]   Ah, right.
[01:09:58.920 --> 01:09:59.400]   It isn't.
[01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:01.880]   And that was the case we were talking about Justin Bieber's
[01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:02.880]   fame.
[01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:03.920]   We used a small clip.
[01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:06.480]   There was certainly no damage to the value of that clip.
[01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:08.760]   So what was number two again?
[01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:11.240]   Is the source material intended for the public good?
[01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:12.760]   And so it was for the new show.
[01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:15.080]   Well, even if it's humor, humor is the public good.
[01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:16.160]   So you can make fun of something.
[01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:18.040]   So I think it's pretty clear we satisfy those tests.
[01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:19.720]   So what was number three?
[01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:20.960]   How much was taken?
[01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:21.960]   You didn't take much.
[01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:23.480]   You took like nothing, actually.
[01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:25.360]   And then the last one was, I'm sorry?
[01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:27.000]   What's the market effect?
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:28.640]   It would be beneficial.
[01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:29.560]   It would be beneficial if anything.
[01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:30.280]   Yeah.
[01:10:30.280 --> 01:10:32.120]   So yeah, you may have made all four.
[01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:34.680]   Now, but a judge would say that.
[01:10:34.680 --> 01:10:36.480]   My lawyer says that.
[01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:38.840]   How do I get YouTube to say it?
[01:10:38.840 --> 01:10:39.440]   You can't.
[01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:40.040]   It's automated.
[01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:41.600]   It's a robot.
[01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:42.320]   It's a robot.
[01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:43.320]   It's a form.
[01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:49.360]   I don't know what it's a robot with a feedback mechanism that, you know, Jeff Adwood, he contested
[01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:54.800]   this on at least basis three and four and found that the copyright owner rejected it
[01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:55.800]   without explanation.
[01:10:55.800 --> 01:10:56.800]   Right.
[01:10:56.800 --> 01:10:57.800]   They don't.
[01:10:57.800 --> 01:10:58.800]   You'd have to actually take them to court.
[01:10:58.800 --> 01:10:59.800]   They might.
[01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:00.800]   You'd have to take them to court.
[01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:01.800]   You can file a dispute claim.
[01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:05.480]   I guess my issue is like, is the dispute resolved as quickly as the content is flagged
[01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:06.480]   or nearly as quickly?
[01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:07.480]   And I can't possibly be.
[01:11:07.480 --> 01:11:09.040]   But is it obviously humans are involved.
[01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:13.920]   Well, we have actual damages because we that video is the Twitch show from last week was
[01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:16.480]   taken off of YouTube, not aired on YouTube.
[01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:18.440]   That's tens of thousands of the SNL clip.
[01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:18.920]   Yeah.
[01:11:18.920 --> 01:11:21.560]   And that's tens of thousands of views that we've lost.
[01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:23.120]   So it's like a two hour show.
[01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:24.880]   For five seconds, you got pulled.
[01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:25.400]   Right.
[01:11:25.400 --> 01:11:25.920]   Basically.
[01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:26.560]   That's crazy.
[01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:27.320]   And that's crazy.
[01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:32.720]   With point, he's like, look, I wanted to quote this movie in a blog post about a whole bunch
[01:11:32.720 --> 01:11:33.480]   of things.
[01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:36.520]   It's not my intention to rebroadcast the film.
[01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:39.440]   I'm not trying to damage sales of the film.
[01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:45.080]   And as a media personality, as a journalistic function, even if you're not a journalist,
[01:11:45.080 --> 01:11:48.800]   you're performing a journalistic function, that should be allowed.
[01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:52.760]   And so YouTube, his fear was like, wow, YouTube built this thing.
[01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:55.640]   And it actually works really, really well.
[01:11:55.640 --> 01:11:57.440]   And that has frightening implications.
[01:11:57.440 --> 01:12:01.960]   Larry Lessig has talked about a pendulum swing with copyright holders.
[01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:05.880]   And certainly it's swung very much in favor of copyright holders.
[01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:08.120]   And it's not swinging back that I can see.
[01:12:08.120 --> 01:12:12.000]   Well, ironically, the technology has swung, and this is the Justin TV story, has swung
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.800]   very much in the favor of public.
[01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:19.880]   Because yeah, the law is supporting, and YouTube's technology is supporting the copyright holders,
[01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:24.360]   but frankly, the fact that I can post you to it everywhere, and it's wack-a-mole to
[01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:27.160]   keep it down in the long run, technology's on our side.
[01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:29.880]   So it's a very interesting situation.
[01:12:29.880 --> 01:12:35.840]   It's also ironic, as Bart's and I said, when YouTube was sold, I mean, I can't remember
[01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:41.920]   it was in the '20s or '30s of other video services that were out there at the time.
[01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:45.160]   What actually put YouTube, and I've heard this from several people that were inside
[01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:52.240]   the company at the time, what put them on the map was the SNL clip from the, it was the
[01:12:52.240 --> 01:12:53.240]   cupcake.
[01:12:53.240 --> 01:12:54.240]   Dick in a box.
[01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:55.240]   Yeah, it's no, it was the cupcake one.
[01:12:55.240 --> 01:12:56.240]   It was cupcakes.
[01:12:56.240 --> 01:12:57.240]   Cupcake's.
[01:12:57.240 --> 01:12:58.240]   The Magnolia Cafe.
[01:12:58.240 --> 01:12:59.240]   That's right.
[01:12:59.240 --> 01:13:00.240]   That's right.
[01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:01.240]   Yeah.
[01:13:01.240 --> 01:13:02.240]   They got five million views on YouTube.
[01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:03.240]   Yeah.
[01:13:03.240 --> 01:13:05.760]   And they literally said, if that video hadn't have happened, there's absolutely no way
[01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:09.680]   that they would have been as big as at the time as they were.
[01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:13.120]   So the irony is quite striking.
[01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:14.960]   Palpable, I would believe.
[01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:15.960]   Palpable.
[01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:16.960]   That's what they're doing.
[01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:17.960]   I can taste it.
[01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:18.960]   I can taste it.
[01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:20.240]   I can tell you're talking about tasting it, by the way.
[01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:24.560]   This coffee maker that I was ridiculing makes the heck of a good cup of coffee.
[01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:25.560]   It's pretty good.
[01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:27.760]   It's the one from last week at 175 degrees.
[01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:28.760]   Yeah, with a plunger.
[01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:29.760]   Yeah.
[01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:30.760]   It's a stomach.
[01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:32.400]   You saw that baritone day.
[01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:37.400]   I didn't see it.
[01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:38.400]   Delicious.
[01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:39.880]   You actually listened to this show?
[01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:40.880]   Yeah.
[01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:45.960]   I listened to Debbie Steer, who works at HarperCollins, and is the editor for my book.
[01:13:45.960 --> 01:13:48.120]   She posted this on our Tumblr.
[01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:51.880]   I actually listened to it in 2X on my iPhone.
[01:13:51.880 --> 01:13:52.880]   That's the way to listen.
[01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:57.680]   We intentionally make the show take twice as long as it ought to.
[01:13:57.680 --> 01:14:00.560]   I was like, I don't have necessarily two hours.
[01:14:00.560 --> 01:14:06.680]   But Apple does a pretty good job of doubling the speed without destroying the pitch of everybody's
[01:14:06.680 --> 01:14:07.680]   voice.
[01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:08.680]   So, so baritone day?
[01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:12.120]   This commercial is for you.
[01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:17.160]   Well, I never re-listen to the ones that I've been on because that's just weird.
[01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:18.160]   Yeah, I know.
[01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:19.160]   I don't even.
[01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:21.160]   Which means I never listen.
[01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:24.520]   We're going to take a little break and then it's talk like a pirate day.
[01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:27.360]   So I'm going to ask each of you to say R.
[01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:32.360]   Gina makes a little fist.
[01:14:32.360 --> 01:14:34.360]   Is that a pirate fist?
[01:14:34.360 --> 01:14:36.360]   Yes, the pirate fist.
[01:14:36.360 --> 01:14:37.360]   Right.
[01:14:37.360 --> 01:14:40.480]   Do they have pirates in the clouds?
[01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:42.200]   They do.
[01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:44.840]   Floating by on these giant pirate ships.
[01:14:44.840 --> 01:14:46.120]   That's where they all are now.
[01:14:46.120 --> 01:14:47.920]   That's where they all are.
[01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:50.320]   Taking down the MPAA site as they go by.
[01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:51.320]   Yes.
[01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:56.640]   Did I say, have I said recently how much I love 4chan?
[01:14:56.640 --> 01:14:58.240]   Love them.
[01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:02.440]   And I also love my Ford Mustang with a great Ford Sync in it.
[01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:07.600]   And if you're looking for a very reasonable priced car that's cute, fun to drive, gets
[01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:10.520]   great gas mileage, has the Ford Sync in it.
[01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:14.440]   I got to tell you, it goes John.
[01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:16.680]   It was good you did that quickly enough.
[01:15:16.680 --> 01:15:19.480]   And actually, as you say that, I'm going to change the lower third because it says
[01:15:19.480 --> 01:15:20.480]   "derve one" today.
[01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:22.640]   And I don't mean it to be "derve one."
[01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:25.720]   I mean it to be "drive one" today.
[01:15:25.720 --> 01:15:27.800]   There you go.
[01:15:27.800 --> 01:15:29.520]   You could "derve it."
[01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:30.520]   You will love it so much.
[01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:31.840]   You'll want to "derve it."
[01:15:31.840 --> 01:15:33.480]   The Ford Fiesta.
[01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:34.480]   Take a look at it.
[01:15:34.480 --> 01:15:38.720]   Your local Ford dealer, the new 2011 just came out and EPA estimated 40 miles to gallon
[01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:41.000]   on the highway.
[01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:45.960]   No other compact car is more fuel efficient than the 2011 Ford Fiesta according to the
[01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:46.960]   EPA.
[01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:51.560]   It's that great 1.6 liter Duratec Ti, VCT, i4 engine.
[01:15:51.560 --> 01:15:52.560]   It's a good way.
[01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:53.560]   It's happy.
[01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:54.680]   It's fun to drive.
[01:15:54.680 --> 01:15:56.680]   It has things like my Mustang has this too and I love it.
[01:15:56.680 --> 01:15:59.400]   The easy fuel capitalist filter system.
[01:15:59.400 --> 01:16:00.400]   So I never have to open the car.
[01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:02.880]   I just pop open the thing and boom, put the gas in.
[01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:04.200]   Bob, close it.
[01:16:04.200 --> 01:16:08.640]   The 4-inch multi-functional display with LCD screen and that's where the sink is, which
[01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:11.080]   means you can talk to your Ford.
[01:16:11.080 --> 01:16:12.520]   You can tell it's a play a pocket.
[01:16:12.520 --> 01:16:14.160]   Play Twit 266.
[01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:15.760]   It plays it for you.
[01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:18.520]   You can check the weather movie listings.
[01:16:18.520 --> 01:16:22.960]   Get turn by turn voice directions without having to purchase additional hardware.
[01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:24.640]   911 Assist is great too.
[01:16:24.640 --> 01:16:30.640]   It'll automatically if the airbags are deployed, call 911 and feed it your GPS coordinates.
[01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:32.440]   This is kind of weird but it happened to me.
[01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:34.640]   The first time it happened to me it was strange.
[01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:37.560]   I have the new Droid X and I'm many Droid phones.
[01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:40.400]   It will read you your text messages.
[01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:45.240]   So a little alarm goes off and then in a very nice female voice my text messages are
[01:16:45.240 --> 01:16:50.160]   read to me, which is a little weird but a guy great.
[01:16:50.160 --> 01:16:53.800]   It's a design that just looks, well you can see it, the image on the screen.
[01:16:53.800 --> 01:16:55.560]   It's just so cute.
[01:16:55.560 --> 01:16:56.560]   Very kinetic.
[01:16:56.560 --> 01:16:57.560]   Feels great.
[01:16:57.560 --> 01:17:03.080]   Interior that looks cool has great features including optional heated leather trim seats,
[01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:07.600]   power shift six speed automatic transmission, intelligent access with a push button start
[01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:08.600]   which is great.
[01:17:08.600 --> 01:17:11.320]   I want you to take a look at the new Ford Fiesta.
[01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:13.560]   It is a hot car.
[01:17:13.560 --> 01:17:14.560]   I just really love it.
[01:17:14.560 --> 01:17:16.640]   I just love what Ford's doing.
[01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:19.000]   They have really brought the pride back to Detroit.
[01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.520]   I have one today, the new Ford Fiesta at a dealer near you.
[01:17:21.520 --> 01:17:23.920]   Now ladies and gentlemen, John C. Devory.
[01:17:23.920 --> 01:17:26.920]   I would make it look like a wipe.
[01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:27.920]   It was a wipe.
[01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:31.520]   I should have switched when you did that and it would look just like a wipe.
[01:17:31.520 --> 01:17:32.520]   So I have John.
[01:17:32.520 --> 01:17:33.520]   Yeah.
[01:17:33.520 --> 01:17:36.520]   So this is the first time we've actually met and I was warned.
[01:17:36.520 --> 01:17:40.120]   I heard that you were somewhat of a commudgeon but I have to say you're a really nice lovable
[01:17:40.120 --> 01:17:41.120]   guy.
[01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:42.120]   I am.
[01:17:42.120 --> 01:17:43.120]   This is a known fact.
[01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:44.120]   Did people warn you?
[01:17:44.120 --> 01:17:45.880]   Did people warn you?
[01:17:45.880 --> 01:17:46.880]   People warned you.
[01:17:46.880 --> 01:17:48.240]   Oh, I just got to kill you.
[01:17:48.240 --> 01:17:50.160]   They said, oh, he's a grumpy one.
[01:17:50.160 --> 01:17:51.160]   Be careful.
[01:17:51.160 --> 01:17:52.160]   Really?
[01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:53.160]   Yes, but she works in the New York Times.
[01:17:53.160 --> 01:17:55.080]   I have a grudge.
[01:17:55.080 --> 01:17:57.520]   I got to bring something about the Ford things since you were still there.
[01:17:57.520 --> 01:17:59.560]   They don't want to belabor the commercial.
[01:17:59.560 --> 01:18:01.480]   But your car is parked out there.
[01:18:01.480 --> 01:18:02.480]   That hot red Mustang.
[01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:03.480]   Oh, I love my car.
[01:18:03.480 --> 01:18:05.360]   It looks like a car that I know offensively.
[01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:07.320]   I don't want to be mean about this.
[01:18:07.320 --> 01:18:12.920]   But this looks like a car that, what just happens when guys get older and then they
[01:18:12.920 --> 01:18:15.040]   get the young girlfriend and the Ferrari and this.
[01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:16.760]   You look like one of the, you look like a guy.
[01:18:16.760 --> 01:18:18.520]   You go through a middle age, what's that called?
[01:18:18.520 --> 01:18:19.520]   Crisis.
[01:18:19.520 --> 01:18:20.520]   Crisis.
[01:18:20.520 --> 01:18:21.520]   He looks like a crisis.
[01:18:21.520 --> 01:18:24.880]   I'm telling you, stop embarrassing yourself and get a Fiesta.
[01:18:24.880 --> 01:18:26.440]   I probably should.
[01:18:26.440 --> 01:18:27.440]   Seriously.
[01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:28.880]   Is that what you get after the been left?
[01:18:28.880 --> 01:18:29.880]   What do you tell?
[01:18:29.880 --> 01:18:30.880]   I'm John Sederkureus.
[01:18:30.880 --> 01:18:31.880]   This is the same Lexus I've always had.
[01:18:31.880 --> 01:18:35.360]   But as beside the point, if I was going to buy a Ford right now, I'd buy that Fiesta.
[01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:36.360]   I would too.
[01:18:36.360 --> 01:18:37.360]   That's a cute car.
[01:18:37.360 --> 01:18:38.360]   You know what I tell you?
[01:18:38.360 --> 01:18:39.360]   It's better for older people.
[01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:40.360]   Wow.
[01:18:40.360 --> 01:18:41.360]   Tough, tough crowd.
[01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:46.360]   I was about to say that John's crankiness was refreshing, but no, no.
[01:18:46.360 --> 01:18:50.400]   I'm just trying to get Leo so he doesn't make himself look like a guy.
[01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:54.840]   He's got to, he's probably listening to rap music as he drives around.
[01:18:54.840 --> 01:18:55.840]   He actually has.
[01:18:55.840 --> 01:18:57.840]   Leo, I bet you look damn good in that car.
[01:18:57.840 --> 01:18:58.840]   Thank you, Gina.
[01:18:58.840 --> 01:19:02.480]   Now I need his young girlfriend and I'll be set.
[01:19:02.480 --> 01:19:05.120]   One of the best things I've ever done in my life.
[01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:07.960]   I rented a Dodge Shelby from Hertz.
[01:19:07.960 --> 01:19:09.760]   Oh, isn't that fun?
[01:19:09.760 --> 01:19:14.720]   They have a very limited number of rental centers that will rent out these sports cars.
[01:19:14.720 --> 01:19:18.000]   It was a special occasion and I had this car and I drove it.
[01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:19.000]   Isn't it fun?
[01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:20.000]   It was beautiful.
[01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:21.000]   Yeah.
[01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:24.360]   So I recommend everybody be irresponsible financially and do that once.
[01:19:24.360 --> 01:19:27.000]   You know, I think before I bought the Mustang, I did that.
[01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:28.000]   You're going to get Ferrari.
[01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:29.000]   I heard that.
[01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:30.880]   I would like to get a musty, musty shell back.
[01:19:30.880 --> 01:19:31.880]   Musty shell back.
[01:19:31.880 --> 01:19:35.760]   I like to get a musty shell back too.
[01:19:35.760 --> 01:19:37.560]   I'm telling you, I need something to scoot.
[01:19:37.560 --> 01:19:38.560]   My back is killing me.
[01:19:38.560 --> 01:19:40.240]   No, I mean, a Shelby Mustang.
[01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:43.640]   The 2011, I took it, they took me on the test track at Ford with the 2011.
[01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:44.640]   Why don't you get a good one?
[01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:45.640]   I don't know.

[01:37:00.640 --> 01:37:01.640]   I don't know.
[01:37:01.640 --> 01:37:02.640]   I don't know.
[01:37:02.640 --> 01:37:03.640]   I don't know.
[01:37:03.640 --> 01:37:04.640]   I don't know.
[01:37:04.640 --> 01:37:05.640]   I don't know.
[01:37:05.640 --> 01:37:06.640]   I don't know.
[01:37:06.640 --> 01:37:07.640]   I don't know.
[01:37:07.640 --> 01:37:08.640]   I don't know.
[01:37:08.640 --> 01:37:09.640]   I don't know.
[01:37:09.640 --> 01:37:10.640]   I don't know.
[01:37:10.640 --> 01:37:11.640]   I might just go with the Android version.
[01:37:11.640 --> 01:37:12.640]   It's interesting.
[01:37:12.640 --> 01:37:17.920]   The thing is, Gina Brink, this social aspect that Nick talked about of coming over and sharing
[01:37:17.920 --> 01:37:23.240]   your favorite clips, that's not merely like Nick built in "I Live in the Future" thing.
[01:37:23.240 --> 01:37:25.120]   I mean, I've seen kids do that.
[01:37:25.120 --> 01:37:27.640]   I was hanging out in the Apple Store a couple of months ago.
[01:37:27.640 --> 01:37:28.640]   Hold up the book.
[01:37:28.640 --> 01:37:29.640]   And teenagers.
[01:37:29.640 --> 01:37:30.640]   He should definitely.
[01:37:30.640 --> 01:37:32.640]   I encourage everybody.
[01:37:32.640 --> 01:37:33.640]   Might as well.
[01:37:33.640 --> 01:37:35.640]   Buy every version of this book.
[01:37:35.640 --> 01:37:36.640]   Buy it in print.
[01:37:36.640 --> 01:37:37.640]   Buy for iBooks.
[01:37:37.640 --> 01:37:38.640]   Buy for Kennel.
[01:37:38.640 --> 01:37:41.000]   Is there an audible version of it yet, Nick?
[01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:42.240]   Did you read the audio?
[01:37:42.240 --> 01:37:43.800]   It's available for everything.
[01:37:43.800 --> 01:37:46.960]   But the iBook store, because Random House and Apple are still fighting.
[01:37:46.960 --> 01:37:48.400]   You can get it for Kindle for your iPad.
[01:37:48.400 --> 01:37:49.400]   But there's audio book.
[01:37:49.400 --> 01:37:50.400]   There's print.
[01:37:50.400 --> 01:37:51.400]   There's Kindle.
[01:37:51.400 --> 01:37:52.400]   Did you do the reading?
[01:37:52.400 --> 01:37:54.040]   Did you do the audio?
[01:37:54.040 --> 01:37:55.040]   I did not.
[01:37:55.040 --> 01:37:57.120]   But I spoke to them about it.
[01:37:57.120 --> 01:37:58.480]   I probably wouldn't have been much fun.
[01:37:58.480 --> 01:38:02.080]   I would have lost my attention halfway through and wandered off and started talking about
[01:38:02.080 --> 01:38:03.720]   the iPad.
[01:38:03.720 --> 01:38:07.880]   This thing about people coming together around their shared video experiences.
[01:38:07.880 --> 01:38:09.200]   Or shared experiences period.
[01:38:09.200 --> 01:38:12.120]   But video is a very important part of our lives.
[01:38:12.120 --> 01:38:16.720]   I saw kids in the Apple Store on 14th Street in New York.
[01:38:16.720 --> 01:38:19.160]   They would just come there to share videos with one another.
[01:38:19.160 --> 01:38:20.160]   They're all on YouTube.
[01:38:20.160 --> 01:38:23.480]   They're all checking out things they've been doing earlier.
[01:38:23.480 --> 01:38:28.120]   And they're watching videos and laughing and playing and rhyming and doing all this
[01:38:28.120 --> 01:38:30.400]   stuff and it's highly social.
[01:38:30.400 --> 01:38:34.640]   People have this fear that technology disconnects us from one another.
[01:38:34.640 --> 01:38:35.920]   That it's unhuman.
[01:38:35.920 --> 01:38:37.720]   That it makes us more like machines.
[01:38:37.720 --> 01:38:42.800]   But in so many ways it can actually strengthen the connection that we have to one another.
[01:38:42.800 --> 01:38:47.160]   And when you see kids who don't have any dogmatic view of these things.
[01:38:47.160 --> 01:38:48.760]   This is very natural for them.
[01:38:48.760 --> 01:38:52.800]   And they come to a computer and they're like, I want to watch this video with my friends
[01:38:52.800 --> 01:38:55.160]   in the same physical space.
[01:38:55.160 --> 01:38:56.440]   That's a beautiful thing to watch.
[01:38:56.440 --> 01:39:00.640]   And so to accept that Apple TV, Google, ZB, Boxy, etc.
[01:39:00.640 --> 01:39:03.560]   Allow that to happen in our homes where this started.
[01:39:03.560 --> 01:39:07.440]   And I remember the 80s when music videos were a new thing and people coming over to watch
[01:39:07.440 --> 01:39:12.520]   the latest Michael Jackson video or the latest Prince video or the latest Kumo D video.
[01:39:12.520 --> 01:39:13.680]   That was a big deal.
[01:39:13.680 --> 01:39:15.920]   And I think it still can be a big deal.
[01:39:15.920 --> 01:39:19.600]   So long as we maintain the environment that encourages that and don't lock things down
[01:39:19.600 --> 01:39:20.600]   too much.
[01:39:20.600 --> 01:39:25.120]   I think that with that respect, I think, you know, one of the things.
[01:39:25.120 --> 01:39:26.720]   I'm not even not trying to plug my book.
[01:39:26.720 --> 01:39:29.480]   I'm just saying like one of the reasons why I wrote this is because I think that all these
[01:39:29.480 --> 01:39:32.440]   articles that say the internet is bad for us and it's ruining our brains and all these
[01:39:32.440 --> 01:39:33.440]   things.
[01:39:33.440 --> 01:39:38.400]   You're essentially taking away literacy from this next generation of kids that is growing
[01:39:38.400 --> 01:39:41.320]   up in this world where it's a changing society.
[01:39:41.320 --> 01:39:45.720]   It's a different kind of literacy and our form of literacy isn't the same anymore.
[01:39:45.720 --> 01:39:47.520]   This is on it is on Audible.com.
[01:39:47.520 --> 01:39:49.440]   I know Audible is not an advertiser tonight.
[01:39:49.440 --> 01:39:53.600]   But let me play a little bit of Nick's I live in the future and here's how it works.
[01:39:53.600 --> 01:39:54.680]   I haven't actually heard it yet.
[01:39:54.680 --> 01:39:56.120]   It's Mike Chamberlain reading.
[01:39:56.120 --> 01:39:57.120]   She get a copy.
[01:39:57.120 --> 01:39:58.720]   Cold by Times editors.
[01:39:58.720 --> 01:39:59.720]   My colleagues.
[01:39:59.720 --> 01:40:01.920]   They picked him because he sounds like you.
[01:40:01.920 --> 01:40:03.080]   Business articles are there.
[01:40:03.080 --> 01:40:06.800]   Sports is in the back of the business section on most weekdays.
[01:40:06.800 --> 01:40:09.040]   But that's the problem.
[01:40:09.040 --> 01:40:13.560]   It's only a collection of what editors think is appropriate and it doesn't swirl in my
[01:40:13.560 --> 01:40:14.560]   preferences.
[01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:15.560]   Actually, Mike's a good reader.
[01:40:15.560 --> 01:40:16.720]   I've listened to others of his books.
[01:40:16.720 --> 01:40:18.600]   It is on Audible.
[01:40:18.600 --> 01:40:21.720]   That's actually the intro where I talk about why I canceled my subscription to the New York
[01:40:21.720 --> 01:40:22.720]   Times.
[01:40:22.720 --> 01:40:23.720]   Oh, Jesus.
[01:40:23.720 --> 01:40:24.720]   Oh, God.
[01:40:24.720 --> 01:40:25.720]   That's bold, Nick.
[01:40:25.720 --> 01:40:28.720]   Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick,
[01:40:28.720 --> 01:40:30.720]   Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick,
[01:40:30.720 --> 01:40:31.720]   Nick.
[01:40:31.720 --> 01:40:32.720]   Nice.
[01:40:32.720 --> 01:40:33.720]   It's a changing world.
[01:40:33.720 --> 01:40:34.720]   It's, you know, it's, it's changing society.
[01:40:34.720 --> 01:40:36.720]   Is that what you told your, that what you told Arthur Ochsoltsberger?
[01:40:36.720 --> 01:40:38.960]   Hey, Hardy, here's a question on my mind.
[01:40:38.960 --> 01:40:39.960]   He's working there.
[01:40:39.960 --> 01:40:41.720]   What doesn't he have a comp subscription for God?
[01:40:41.720 --> 01:40:42.720]   That's a good point.
[01:40:42.720 --> 01:40:44.720]   Why don't you even have to pay for anything?
[01:40:44.720 --> 01:40:46.720]   What are you paying for anything?
[01:40:46.720 --> 01:40:49.080]   It's because it's Gina's birthday.
[01:40:49.080 --> 01:40:52.040]   I want to just toss to her because I know she's involved in so many projects.
[01:40:52.040 --> 01:40:55.240]   We know her from Life Hacker, but she's been doing a lot of work with this company called
[01:40:55.240 --> 01:41:00.160]   Expert Labs, which are Neil Dash heads, but he was so excited to get her on staff as a
[01:41:00.160 --> 01:41:02.920]   cool like, what is the latest news from Expert Labs?
[01:41:02.920 --> 01:41:04.720]   You know, what are you guys, what are you doing?
[01:41:04.720 --> 01:41:07.480]   See, he's a cool stuff cooking over there.
[01:41:07.480 --> 01:41:09.880]   My, my, my, my, my, my point out something.
[01:41:09.880 --> 01:41:10.880]   Yeah.
[01:41:10.880 --> 01:41:11.880]   He's a host star.
[01:41:11.880 --> 01:41:12.880]   He's, no, he's a, he's auditioning.
[01:41:12.880 --> 01:41:13.880]   He's auditioning for the show.
[01:41:13.880 --> 01:41:14.880]   He totally took control of the show.
[01:41:14.880 --> 01:41:17.080]   He wants to do the show that you decided.
[01:41:17.080 --> 01:41:18.080]   He's a host.
[01:41:18.080 --> 01:41:19.080]   He's stealing everything.
[01:41:19.080 --> 01:41:21.400]   He's taking all my moving the show along.
[01:41:21.400 --> 01:41:23.680]   And now people in the chat room are saying, I'm a dud.
[01:41:23.680 --> 01:41:27.640]   I should get out of here because, but, or a tune just better than I am.
[01:41:27.640 --> 01:41:29.440]   He's, he's, which is possible.
[01:41:29.440 --> 01:41:30.440]   He's also better looking.
[01:41:30.440 --> 01:41:31.440]   He's well.
[01:41:31.440 --> 01:41:32.440]   Go ahead, Gina.
[01:41:32.440 --> 01:41:33.440]   It's worth it.
[01:41:33.440 --> 01:41:34.440]   What's going on?
[01:41:34.440 --> 01:41:35.960]   What's going on at Expert Labs?
[01:41:35.960 --> 01:41:39.680]   So I'm building this open source, um, web application.
[01:41:39.680 --> 01:41:43.640]   It's called Think Up and you can install it on your web server and we've come a really
[01:41:43.640 --> 01:41:48.000]   long way, really fast and the beta is actually going to get released next week, early next
[01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:49.000]   week, like Monday, Tuesday.
[01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:52.080]   But we've got a simple five minute web based installer.
[01:41:52.080 --> 01:41:55.320]   You're literally, you unzip this file onto your web server and you, you know, click through
[01:41:55.320 --> 01:41:56.920]   three steps, you install it.
[01:41:56.920 --> 01:42:01.240]   It gathers all your tweets and Facebook posts and all the replies to those, those, those
[01:42:01.240 --> 01:42:06.040]   posts and your friends and it lets you search and export and archive and organize your conversations
[01:42:06.040 --> 01:42:07.480]   on various social networks.
[01:42:07.480 --> 01:42:11.520]   And in fact, Baratunde has been a test user for quite some time and he's been one of my
[01:42:11.520 --> 01:42:12.520]   best test users.
[01:42:12.520 --> 01:42:17.560]   I, I would love for you to talk about your fishing nets metaphor, but he's so good at
[01:42:17.560 --> 01:42:21.560]   sort of crowdsourcing information and getting new ideas from his, from his readers, from
[01:42:21.560 --> 01:42:24.040]   the, his onion readers and just his personal Twitter followers.
[01:42:24.040 --> 01:42:26.360]   Anyway, so just kind of a pre plug.
[01:42:26.360 --> 01:42:28.280]   Think up is going to be in beta next week.
[01:42:28.280 --> 01:42:30.480]   There's a, there's a protesting zip file out there.
[01:42:30.480 --> 01:42:35.240]   Now you can download if you just follow Think Up app on Twitter and when the beta's out
[01:42:35.240 --> 01:42:36.680]   next week, you'll, you'll know about it.
[01:42:36.680 --> 01:42:40.320]   I'll talk about it on Twig as well, but we are definitely looking for testers and developers.
[01:42:40.320 --> 01:42:42.840]   It's very simple PHP MySQL app.
[01:42:42.840 --> 01:42:45.320]   And so we're looking for users and coders.
[01:42:45.320 --> 01:42:46.560]   Thank you for the plug, Baratunde.
[01:42:46.560 --> 01:42:47.560]   I appreciate it.
[01:42:47.560 --> 01:42:48.560]   I try.
[01:42:48.560 --> 01:42:49.560]   It's your birthday.
[01:42:49.560 --> 01:42:51.320]   What does it do again?
[01:42:51.320 --> 01:42:52.320]   What does it do again?
[01:42:52.320 --> 01:42:54.320]   Twitter analytics is actually very interesting.
[01:42:54.320 --> 01:42:59.040]   So I'll tell you, I'll tell you the practical use from my perspective is, you know, especially
[01:42:59.040 --> 01:43:03.000]   all of us on the show have a decent Twitter following and I think I love us use it as
[01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:04.320]   a research tool.
[01:43:04.320 --> 01:43:07.120]   You ask people, I'm looking for an app that does this.
[01:43:07.120 --> 01:43:10.040]   I'm looking for a person that knows this reporters use this constantly.
[01:43:10.040 --> 01:43:12.400]   And so Nick and the people at the times are probably using it.
[01:43:12.400 --> 01:43:15.080]   Does anybody know somebody at company X?
[01:43:15.080 --> 01:43:19.800]   The problem is with Twitter, there can be such a high volume of communication replies
[01:43:19.800 --> 01:43:24.960]   that phishing goes out a day later or three days later or seven days later, it's just
[01:43:24.960 --> 01:43:26.320]   a real pain.
[01:43:26.320 --> 01:43:30.480]   And so what they, you know, the think up app allows you to do is attached to the node
[01:43:30.480 --> 01:43:34.840]   that is your tweet, see how many times that tweet's been forwarded, quote unquote, or
[01:43:34.840 --> 01:43:36.000]   retweeted.
[01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:40.680]   And what the replies are to that tweet, you know, if you look at the Twitter.com interface,
[01:43:40.680 --> 01:43:42.000]   you'll see people replying to you.
[01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:45.600]   They have an in reply to and it links back to that original tweet.
[01:43:45.600 --> 01:43:50.280]   So their architecture, you know, supports linking back to the original, even though they
[01:43:50.280 --> 01:43:53.080]   don't support threaded conversations natively.
[01:43:53.080 --> 01:43:54.360]   It sort of built into the architecture.
[01:43:54.360 --> 01:43:59.600]   So when you're as an, as a media organization, organization, especially posting comments or
[01:43:59.600 --> 01:44:03.560]   posting a call for input, it can be very useful to go back and say, Oh, here are the
[01:44:03.560 --> 01:44:07.440]   40 replies I got to question a separate from here.
[01:44:07.440 --> 01:44:10.600]   The 40 replies I got to question B separate from here.
[01:44:10.600 --> 01:44:15.240]   The retweets I got from state and C. And so that's been quite useful for me personally.
[01:44:15.240 --> 01:44:17.560]   I'm using it on a couple of other accounts.
[01:44:17.560 --> 01:44:21.920]   But I think as a research tool, it makes Twitter much more usable in the way that Facebook
[01:44:21.920 --> 01:44:22.920]   kind of natively supports.
[01:44:22.920 --> 01:44:27.520]   You can just look at the timestamp, click on that and see all the replies in line.
[01:44:27.520 --> 01:44:28.520]   I'm sorry.
[01:44:28.520 --> 01:44:29.520]   I asked.
[01:44:29.520 --> 01:44:30.520]   I'm sorry.
[01:44:30.520 --> 01:44:31.520]   There's so much information.
[01:44:31.520 --> 01:44:32.520]   I think it's really cool.
[01:44:32.520 --> 01:44:33.520]   I really, I really love it.
[01:44:33.520 --> 01:44:34.520]   I think it's great.
[01:44:34.520 --> 01:44:35.520]   I want to try it.
[01:44:35.520 --> 01:44:40.000]   You do have to run your own server to do it.
[01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:43.240]   But I imagine at some point, Gina, people will run this as a service.
[01:44:43.240 --> 01:44:48.280]   Yeah, I mean, if you set it up, you can open up registration so all your friends can register.
[01:44:48.280 --> 01:44:52.360]   And you know, maybe at some point we will host an official single place where everyone
[01:44:52.360 --> 01:44:53.360]   can sign up.
[01:44:53.360 --> 01:44:55.760]   But that's not in the cards right now, but maybe eventually.
[01:44:55.760 --> 01:44:59.800]   Lea, can we go to get it?
[01:44:59.800 --> 01:45:00.800]   We're working on the website.
[01:45:00.800 --> 01:45:03.840]   Go to ThinkUpApp.com, which is very sparse right now.
[01:45:03.840 --> 01:45:06.400]   Next week when the beta release happens, we'll have a much prettier website.
[01:45:06.400 --> 01:45:08.480]   But you'll be able to read more information about it.
[01:45:08.480 --> 01:45:11.920]   Actually, the expert lab site, there's a link there and download it.
[01:45:11.920 --> 01:45:15.120]   It's on GitHub, but we're going to have a much prettier download link next week.
[01:45:15.120 --> 01:45:16.680]   So right now, we're still in testing.
[01:45:16.680 --> 01:45:18.480]   Our official release is next Monday.
[01:45:18.480 --> 01:45:22.280]   But if you're early adopter and you're feeling adventurous, grab the zip file and try it
[01:45:22.280 --> 01:45:23.280]   out.
[01:45:23.280 --> 01:45:24.280]   But again, it's not something--
[01:45:24.280 --> 01:45:25.280]   A blog post on it.
[01:45:25.280 --> 01:45:27.400]   You have to run a server.
[01:45:27.400 --> 01:45:30.000]   You have to have PHP, MySQL and all that stuff.
[01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.480]   It's not something you install on your laptop.
[01:45:32.480 --> 01:45:33.480]   Right.
[01:45:33.480 --> 01:45:37.760]   Well, I mean, we built it with the idea that if you have a $5 dream host account or even
[01:45:37.760 --> 01:45:40.840]   if you just install Xamp on your Windows machine, you can run it there.
[01:45:40.840 --> 01:45:44.640]   Now, I mean, granted, this is definitely for nerds who have web servers for sure.
[01:45:44.640 --> 01:45:48.360]   But we tried to make it as simple as possible, the most basic configuration possible.
[01:45:48.360 --> 01:45:49.640]   It's really a great idea.
[01:45:49.640 --> 01:45:51.480]   I just-- I think it's so cool.
[01:45:51.480 --> 01:45:54.480]   Thank you for reminding me about that, actually, Beritane.
[01:45:54.480 --> 01:45:55.480]   Thanks, Beritane.
[01:45:55.480 --> 01:45:56.480]   Absolutely.
[01:45:56.480 --> 01:45:57.480]   I'm here to help.
[01:45:57.480 --> 01:45:58.480]   I'm here to serve the Twit Army, you know?
[01:45:58.480 --> 01:46:01.320]   It's been another great Beritane day.
[01:46:01.320 --> 01:46:03.800]   Hey, it's been a great show.
[01:46:03.800 --> 01:46:05.200]   I hate to stop.
[01:46:05.200 --> 01:46:06.640]   But Eastmeast West is coming up.
[01:46:06.640 --> 01:46:07.640]   Tom Merritt is here.
[01:46:07.640 --> 01:46:10.160]   He's going to do a show with Roger Chang.
[01:46:10.160 --> 01:46:13.880]   In fact, did you get Roger on your cranky keeks?
[01:46:13.880 --> 01:46:15.320]   Yeah, we got him on a couple of times.
[01:46:15.320 --> 01:46:16.560]   And that's what happened to the show, I think.
[01:46:16.560 --> 01:46:18.360]   We put him on a show which canceled.
[01:46:18.360 --> 01:46:19.360]   Yeah.
[01:46:19.360 --> 01:46:21.760]   John C. Devorak is cranky for one more week.
[01:46:21.760 --> 01:46:22.760]   Make sure you catch the cranky keeks.
[01:46:22.760 --> 01:46:23.760]   It's a good show on Wednesday.
[01:46:23.760 --> 01:46:24.920]   It's a final episode on Wednesday.
[01:46:24.920 --> 01:46:25.920]   You already done it?
[01:46:25.920 --> 01:46:26.920]   Yeah.
[01:46:26.920 --> 01:46:27.920]   Oh.
[01:46:27.920 --> 01:46:28.920]   It's in the can.
[01:46:28.920 --> 01:46:29.920]   It's in the can.
[01:46:29.920 --> 01:46:30.920]   So you are in the can as well.
[01:46:30.920 --> 01:46:31.920]   I'm usually in the can.
[01:46:31.920 --> 01:46:33.920]   John is at channeldevorak.com.
[01:46:33.920 --> 01:46:37.440]   The place to go to find out more about John and all the things he does, including the
[01:46:37.440 --> 01:46:43.600]   great No Agenda show with Adam Curry, our good friend, Barretunde.
[01:46:43.600 --> 01:46:46.320]   My next hire, barretunde.com.
[01:46:46.320 --> 01:46:47.320]   I am times.
[01:46:47.320 --> 01:46:49.640]   It's always an honor to be here.
[01:46:49.640 --> 01:46:52.240]   I'm really glad you brought Nick Bilton from the future.
[01:46:52.240 --> 01:46:53.240]   You're a suggestion.
[01:46:53.240 --> 01:46:54.240]   I love the book.
[01:46:54.240 --> 01:46:55.240]   Thank you very much.
[01:46:55.240 --> 01:46:56.240]   It is.
[01:46:56.240 --> 01:46:57.240]   I will take credit for the suggestion.
[01:46:57.240 --> 01:47:01.000]   But there's a lot of great talent in New York and I will keep pushing them your way.
[01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:06.320]   Well, well, if we had a show, we only had a studio in New York, maybe we could do that.
[01:47:06.320 --> 01:47:07.320]   Well, we'll keep in session.
[01:47:07.320 --> 01:47:08.320]   Morning show.
[01:47:08.320 --> 01:47:11.440]   I'm super flattered and honored and very interested.
[01:47:11.440 --> 01:47:12.440]   So good.
[01:47:12.440 --> 01:47:14.400]   Let's keep it all separate from the show.
[01:47:14.400 --> 01:47:15.920]   Yeah, we're not ready to launch it.
[01:47:15.920 --> 01:47:19.080]   It's probably the spring of next year, but it's something I've wanted to do for a long
[01:47:19.080 --> 01:47:20.080]   time.
[01:47:20.080 --> 01:47:21.080]   Okay.
[01:47:21.080 --> 01:47:23.040]   And their advertisers are champing at the bid for it.
[01:47:23.040 --> 01:47:25.040]   So I think it's something we need to do.
[01:47:25.040 --> 01:47:26.040]   Excellent.
[01:47:26.040 --> 01:47:27.040]   Next is the capital of the world.
[01:47:27.040 --> 01:47:28.040]   It is.
[01:47:28.040 --> 01:47:29.040]   It's where everybody wants to be.
[01:47:29.040 --> 01:47:30.040]   It's true.
[01:47:30.040 --> 01:47:31.440]   And you know what, Barretunde?
[01:47:31.440 --> 01:47:34.040]   If you can make it there, you can make it anywhere.
[01:47:34.040 --> 01:47:37.040]   Oh, thanks, papa lea.
[01:47:37.040 --> 01:47:38.680]   Now they're Brooklynite.
[01:47:38.680 --> 01:47:40.520]   Nick Felton.com is a place to go.
[01:47:40.520 --> 01:47:42.960]   His new book, I Live in the Future and here's how it works.
[01:47:42.960 --> 01:47:46.680]   Why your world, work and brain are being creatively disrupted.
[01:47:46.680 --> 01:47:51.760]   I love the message of it, which is that the internet is not bad for us.
[01:47:51.760 --> 01:47:56.280]   It's good for us and it's changing society in an extremely positive way.
[01:47:56.280 --> 01:47:57.280]   We should embrace it.
[01:47:57.280 --> 01:47:59.920]   Not tell people that they're stupid if they go to Google.com.
[01:47:59.920 --> 01:48:00.920]   It's so obvious to me.
[01:48:00.920 --> 01:48:03.480]   And yet so many people think otherwise.
[01:48:03.480 --> 01:48:05.600]   I'm glad you're spreading the word.
[01:48:05.600 --> 01:48:06.600]   Thank you very much.
[01:48:06.600 --> 01:48:07.600]   Thanks for having me on the show.
[01:48:07.600 --> 01:48:08.600]   I really had a great time.
[01:48:08.600 --> 01:48:09.600]   Good.
[01:48:09.600 --> 01:48:10.600]   Come back soon.
[01:48:10.600 --> 01:48:11.600]   See you.
[01:48:11.600 --> 01:48:12.600]   Definitely.
[01:48:12.600 --> 01:48:13.600]   Yeah.
[01:48:13.600 --> 01:48:14.600]   And it's birthday girl, Gina Tarpani.
[01:48:14.600 --> 01:48:15.600]   Thank you so much for being here.
[01:48:15.600 --> 01:48:18.240]   Gina hosts this week in Google with Jeff Jarvis and myself every Wednesday afternoon.
[01:48:18.240 --> 01:48:22.360]   And she writes for Fast Company, fast company.com/worksmart.
[01:48:22.360 --> 01:48:23.720]   Is her new series.
[01:48:23.720 --> 01:48:26.560]   She also blogs at her own site, smarterware.org.
[01:48:26.560 --> 01:48:29.800]   Couldn't have thought of a better way to spend the afternoon my birthday.
[01:48:29.800 --> 01:48:30.800]   Thanks for having me.
[01:48:30.800 --> 01:48:31.800]   I'd be honest with you.
[01:48:31.800 --> 01:48:32.800]   Happy birthday.
[01:48:32.800 --> 01:48:34.840]   I thought there's no way.
[01:48:34.840 --> 01:48:39.360]   So we can sing Happy Birthday, but we cannot use the AOL copyrighted tune.
[01:48:39.360 --> 01:48:42.160]   So let's all sing it in our own tune.
[01:48:42.160 --> 01:48:43.360]   Happy birthday.
[01:48:43.360 --> 01:48:44.360]   Happy birthday.
[01:48:44.360 --> 01:48:49.360]   Happy birthday to you.
[01:48:49.360 --> 01:48:51.600]   A total Happy Birthday.
[01:48:51.600 --> 01:48:52.600]   A total.
[01:48:52.600 --> 01:48:54.600]   Oh, Gina.
[01:48:54.600 --> 01:48:55.920]   Thank you everybody for being here.
[01:48:55.920 --> 01:49:00.720]   We do Twitter every Sunday afternoon, 3 p.m. Pacific's 6 p.m. Easterntimelive.twit.tv.
[01:49:00.720 --> 01:49:03.760]   It would be 2,200 UTC if you're living outside the US.
[01:49:03.760 --> 01:49:06.240]   As I know, almost half of you now do.
[01:49:06.240 --> 01:49:09.800]   We are truly a global venture and we're so glad you listen.
[01:49:09.800 --> 01:49:11.080]   You can watch the show live.
[01:49:11.080 --> 01:49:14.800]   You can also download it in audio and video after the fact from twit.tv.
[01:49:14.800 --> 01:49:16.440]   I'm Leo LaPorte.
[01:49:16.440 --> 01:49:17.440]   Thanks for being here.
[01:49:17.440 --> 01:49:18.440]   We'll see you next time.
[01:49:18.440 --> 01:49:19.440]   Another twit.
[01:49:19.440 --> 01:49:20.440]   This is amazing.
[01:49:20.440 --> 01:49:21.440]   It's going to be okay.
[01:49:21.440 --> 01:49:22.440]   So when I'm in this...
[01:49:22.440 --> 01:49:23.440]   No, I think you were here once.
[01:49:23.440 --> 01:49:25.400]   I think we did run into each other one time.
[01:49:25.400 --> 01:49:26.400]   Next time.
[01:49:26.400 --> 01:49:27.400]   You just don't remember.
[01:49:27.400 --> 01:49:28.400]   Next time.
[01:49:28.400 --> 01:49:29.400]   Never forget meeting Johnson.
[01:49:29.400 --> 01:49:32.840]   Dude, I used to read you an information week when I was in high school.
[01:49:32.840 --> 01:49:33.840]   Wow.
[01:49:33.840 --> 01:49:34.840]   Yes, unusual.
[01:49:34.840 --> 01:49:35.840]   It's probably info world actually.
[01:49:35.840 --> 01:49:36.840]   Info world.
[01:49:36.840 --> 01:49:37.840]   That's right.
[01:49:37.840 --> 01:49:38.840]   No, it was definitely information week.
[01:49:38.840 --> 01:49:39.840]   No, no, no.
[01:49:39.840 --> 01:49:42.040]   I've never wrote one word for information week in my time.
[01:49:42.040 --> 01:49:44.040]   Then it was information info world.
[01:49:44.040 --> 01:49:45.040]   Okay, you're right.
[01:49:45.040 --> 01:49:46.040]   I'm sitting here.
[01:49:46.040 --> 01:49:47.040]   He was the back page.
[01:49:47.040 --> 01:49:50.880]   I'm sitting around the kitchen table and I was a super geeky nerdy dude.
[01:49:50.880 --> 01:49:53.960]   I'm like, I want to read about business IT decisions.
[01:49:53.960 --> 01:49:57.240]   You know, one sixth step.
[01:49:57.240 --> 01:49:58.240]   That is bad.
[01:49:58.240 --> 01:50:00.240]   I'm sorry that you did that.
[01:50:00.240 --> 01:50:05.240]   But it made me a better person today.
[01:50:05.240 --> 01:50:12.240]   I'm going to read you an information book.
