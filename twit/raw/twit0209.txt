[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.480]   And when we first started working together, I think you were in 23 magazines, 23 columns
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:05.480]   a month.
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.920]   It was 23 columns a month, but it wasn't a lot of it was cheated by you.
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:10.920]   Yeah, PCMag was like--
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.320]   Well, it was also written for the examiner.
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.080]   Yeah, it was like, every day.
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.080]   Yeah.
[00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.080]   I hate that.
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.080]   I hate that.
[00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.400]   Also with this, and in the first time, and I'm really thrilled to get you on the show,

[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.480]   Hey Leo, thanks for having me.
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.720]   You've got an empire now over at GigaOMA.
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.480]   I don't know.
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.160]   Not as big an empire as you have.
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.480]   Well, how many-- so it was originally just your blog, and now you've got a number of
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.640]   bloggers working for you, and it seems like a number of channels too.
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:38.640]   Right.
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.640]   We have seven blogs now, including GigaOMA.
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:48.720]   We have new TV, Earth2Tech, WebWorkerDaily, Ostatic, the Apple Blog, and JK on the run including.
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.800]   And we've just launched a subscription service called GigaOMA Pro, which is a research service

[00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:00.720]   You get unlimited research on five verticals for now, and you keep adding more verticals
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:01.720]   to it.
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.840]   It's funny because John and I always talked about doing some vertical stuff.
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.600]   Well that's where the money is, isn't it?
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:13.040]   You can get an executive to lay some dough on you for information that can help them in
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.040]   their business.
[00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.040]   Right.
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.480]   We always thought that would be the smart thing to do.
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:17.640]   Did you ever do that, John?
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:18.640]   No.
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:19.640]   No.
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:20.640]   Oh, I'm the smart guy.
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:21.640]   No, I didn't do it.
[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:22.640]   Okay.
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:23.640]   You know why I didn't do it?
[00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.360]   It's more fun for me to cover end-user computing than anything else.
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.600]   I have no interest in business.
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.920]   What you really have interested in is playing around overpriced gear.
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:32.920]   That's it.
[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:33.920]   That's all it is.
[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.160]   Look at this Gary's got.
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.840]   He's got a whole new rig in here.
[00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.680]   People who are listening to the podcast don't know it.
[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.600]   But he's got like, look, you feel that you're on a Star Trek set.
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:45.600]   Only the stuff actually works.
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.480]   Do you know how many screens now I have around me?
[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.840]   I have 13 screens surrounding me.
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:50.840]   Yeah.
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:51.840]   That's ridiculous.
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:52.840]   Yeah, it is.
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.280]   Thank this guy here, Kirk Harnack.
[00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.640]   He is the, Harnack the Magnificent we're calling him.
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:06.000]   He is the guy, Director of International Business for Telos Corporation.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   Telos makes the Zephyrs that you and I use.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.720]   They make phone interfaces and radio stations.
[00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.480]   What I didn't know is they also make sound consoles.
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:17.240]   So Kirk, out of the blue about six months ago sent me an email saying, I hear all the
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:21.160]   trouble you're having with mixed minus on Skype.
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.480]   He would like to try this stuff.
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.280]   And so they, they, they lend us a Axia system.
[00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.280]   That's what we're using here.
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.240]   It's a digital, so I'm going to give him a big plug because it's very kind of cool.
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.640]   Well, they, they lend it to us.
[00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:32.800]   It's an 18 channel.
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.320]   It's like a $30,000 audio system.
[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:36.320]   It's 18 channels.
[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.080]   But it's, but you know what's neat about it?
[00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.480]   It's, oh, we use them.
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:41.480]   Kirk asked the same thing.
[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.040]   He said, how many channels is that 18?
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.920]   He said, what do you need 18 channels for?
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.080]   Well, explain it.
[00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.080]   I sure can't get it.
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.600]   Kirk, are we not using them all in some form or fashion?
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:56.160]   I mean, there's some, if you want to fill up, but, but we'll have a, we'll have an auxiliary
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.440]   input here tomorrow where you can bring up, you know, iPod or something to plug and if
[00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:01.640]   a guest has something to plug.
[00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:02.640]   Oh, that's nice.
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:03.640]   Yeah.
[00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:04.640]   Yeah.
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:05.640]   It's digital, which is neat.
[00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:09.920]   I mean, that's what, for us, this is really a kind of timely because we used to be doing,
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:12.840]   you know, the microphones are still analog, obviously they have to record your voice,
[00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.120]   but everything else like, oh, man's coming in through Skype on a digital channel.
[00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:21.040]   Why should we make a conversion to, uh, for, to analog at any point?
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:22.360]   And that's what we were doing.
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.280]   So now Ohm's audio stays digital from end to end.
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.000]   The only thing analog is your headset.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.360]   Oh, and the rest of it comes in here.
[00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.720]   You know, the cool thing is it's not just digital.
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.160]   It's all IP.
[00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:36.200]   So we've made, uh, our people have made digital consoles for quite a few years now for probably
[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:37.200]   20 years.
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.840]   They've been digital consoles, which are digital equivalents of what they replaced analog music
[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.760]   studios now are all recording digitally.
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:44.760]   Yes.
[00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:45.760]   Pro tools and a record.
[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:47.960]   It's not just the IP part, but that's completely different.
[00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:48.960]   Yeah.
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.640]   Is IP and we're one of only three companies that does that and we were the first.
[00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:57.720]   So if you look underneath my desk, it used to be all these analog wires.
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.680]   I mean, like hundreds of analog wires going on in here.
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:04.600]   Now it's one ether, basically one ethernet cable that carries all the data.
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:08.960]   It is a dedicated ethernet land though, because we decided not to mix the packets with our
[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:09.960]   business land.
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:10.960]   So we have two lands.
[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:15.120]   So every computer that we're getting audio from or audio into has to have two network
[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.120]   cards.
[00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:19.440]   So the, we're recording this, for instance, on a PC with audition.
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:24.720]   That's got a regular LAN card to get out to the outside world, but it's also got the audio
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:25.720]   land.
[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.400]   That's what I'm calling it, the audio land.
[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.440]   And that's the packets there going back and forth.
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:33.440]   They're all from, you know, the Axia system, but I tell you, there's no noise.
[00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:34.440]   It's really amazing.
[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:38.640]   And then there's built in, the board is a, is the board is not the, not the mixer.
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:40.640]   The board is just a, it's like a keyboard.
[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:41.640]   It's a surface.
[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:43.720]   That beautiful thing that John's a surface.
[00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:45.920]   It's, it's a mouse that looks like a console.
[00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:46.920]   Yeah.
[00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:49.800]   And then all of the stuff is behind you that's really doing all the work, but that's, that's
[00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.200]   a court two, right?
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:52.840]   It's a court to duo.
[00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:56.800]   And the console is basically exists in software.
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:01.080]   We've got guys in Regalatvia who, who write the, write the code for that.
[00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:03.280]   So this thing is just basically a mouse.
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:04.280]   It's mouse.
[00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:07.600]   There's no evidence that people will ever want to use that.
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.240]   Did you write that?
[00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.840]   I think you wrote that.
[00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:16.080]   John C. Devorek copying to the fact that in like 1942, he said, nobody will ever need
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:17.080]   a mouse.
[00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:18.080]   They never said that.
[00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:19.080]   I said, I, there's no evidence.
[00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:20.080]   There's no evidence.
[00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:23.480]   That's a pretty, that's, that's a little bit of a cop out.
[00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:26.480]   It was accurate the time I said because I was, it was a cop out when I wrote it.
[00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:28.360]   I didn't, I wasn't going to be, I wasn't sure.
[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:29.680]   I just said there's no evidence.
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:31.720]   When did you, when did you start covering technology?
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:32.720]   How long has it been?
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:34.560]   Ooh, a long time.
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:36.640]   I guess since 91, 92.
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:37.640]   So me too.
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:45.760]   Well, I started writing for Biden in 4.78 and was just, I was a DJ slash technology journalist
[00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:49.360]   till 91 when John rescued me and saved him.
[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:51.360]   He saved me from a fake worse death.
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.080]   In combination with Russia Limbaugh.
[00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:53.920]   Yeah, right.
[00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:57.200]   I lost my job because Rush got my midday gig.
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:02.920]   And still the fun is me and 550 other midday talk show host, that'll work.
[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:06.280]   There's this guy named Rush and this is when Rush was like, do, do, do, do, do, do, do,
[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:07.280]   shut up your people.
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:10.040]   We've got to news bulletin nuts, from a Nazis.
[00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:13.080]   You know, he was, he was really, it was really a showman.
[00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:17.160]   And I'm thinking, what the hell this, this is what I get bumped by this guy.
[00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:18.640]   This is radio is going.
[00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:19.640]   Oh man, you know what?
[00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:23.440]   The day they told me that I went out and I chopped a quarter wood.
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:25.400]   You that I just didn't know what to do.
[00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:26.880]   I was like, what have I chosen?
[00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:32.200]   I mean, I'm 33 or something and I've chosen the wrong profession clearly.
[00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:35.160]   But that was little did I know what a break that was.
[00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:36.880]   In fact, I want to do, I'm going to do it.
[00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:38.400]   It's still be a local yoke.
[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:39.400]   Exactly.
[00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:40.400]   The crappy little show.
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:41.400]   Exactly.
[00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:46.960]   I'd be, oh no, the, the author of the latest chicken soup for the soul is with us today.
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:48.360]   And I mean, that's what I was doing.
[00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:49.360]   Yeah, I know.
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:51.360]   No wonder there were no ratings.
[00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:54.720]   The show was, and it was a classic because I still hear one of those, that type of show
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:55.720]   once in a while.
[00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:56.880]   Nobody does it anymore.
[00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:57.880]   Yeah.
[00:08:57.880 --> 00:08:58.880]   Well, there's still a few.
[00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:01.880]   They used to call it Kirk will know this full service radio.
[00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:02.880]   Yeah.
[00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:03.880]   Yeah.
[00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:04.880]   A song, a song, the forecast.
[00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:05.880]   Yeah.
[00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:07.360]   Jumping jacks in the morning and another song.
[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:09.200]   I don't remember where you're a combo man at the time.
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:12.560]   I was, well, very, very sometimes combo sometimes not.
[00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:17.040]   But I think towards the end combo means you run your own board and then.
[00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:18.840]   Would you love to do it?
[00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:20.240]   Turns out I like to do it.
[00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:21.320]   Yeah, obviously.
[00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:25.120]   But when you get to be a big time DJ, you have a board up and then you just sit in a
[00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:27.720]   room with a microphone like you're doing right now.
[00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:28.720]   Yeah.
[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:31.160]   And somebody like me is pushing all these buttons.
[00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:32.160]   Right.
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:35.280]   And it turns out I like the control.
[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:37.680]   No, we couldn't guess that.
[00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:40.680]   No, I have more buttons.
[00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:41.680]   Not only do I have a board.
[00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:42.680]   I've got a video.
[00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:44.000]   I've got, I mean, I'm doing all this stuff.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.160]   I'm typing into the chat.
[00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:46.800]   It's really fun.
[00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:47.800]   It's really fun.
[00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:53.800]   Anyway, so that was 91 and they said, well, we're getting to tech news and a little memory
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:57.760]   lane here and they said we're going to, we don't hate you.
[00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:58.760]   That was nice.
[00:09:58.760 --> 00:09:59.760]   Thank you.
[00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:02.120]   But we like Rush better, but we're going to, here's what we're going to let you do.
[00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:08.320]   In nine hours can be our nine hours Saturday and Sunday of talk shows, you'll be the announcer
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:12.680]   and then we'll bring in, you know, the Carrie brothers to talk about home improvement or
[00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:16.560]   Anthony Blue, Anthony, Anthony, that's blue to do wine.
[00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:18.160]   And I said, okay, but can I do a computer show?
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:22.200]   Because this guy, Dvorak and I used to do a, you'd come on my talk show and it was great.
[00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:23.200]   Can I do a computer show?
[00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:25.000]   And they said, well, no, wait, I'm going to listen to that.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.720]   I said, I know, but you're making me do nine hours.
[00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:28.160]   Can one hour be computer?
[00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:29.160]   So they let me do a show with you.
[00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.360]   And that was, no, I didn't know you had to talk him into it.
[00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:31.880]   Oh, yeah.
[00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:33.640]   I thought they said, Dvorak, absolutely.
[00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:34.640]   Oh, yeah.
[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:37.800]   They said, well, look at this is, this was maybe even 90.
[00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:41.480]   This was DOS three, Windows three, DOS two.
[00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:43.760]   This was like, nobody wanted to know about computers.
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:44.760]   They still don't.
[00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:46.200]   We got a lot of calls.
[00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:47.200]   Still a niche.
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:48.200]   You're right.
[00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:49.200]   We did.
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.200]   We always did.
[00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:51.200]   Anyway, that's how it started.
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:53.960]   So you, so yeah, you and I probably went full time computers technology about the same
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:54.960]   time.
[00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:55.960]   Yeah, pretty much.
[00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:57.440]   A lot of changes.
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:58.440]   Yeah.
[00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:00.280]   Well, you know, good changes.
[00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:04.240]   I think that's the great thing about our businesses that you never get bored.
[00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:07.640]   Like every day is just like you start afresh.
[00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:11.720]   It's, you know, memories are great, but it's the future, which is exciting.
[00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:14.760]   And that's what, you know, keeps me going about this business.
[00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:20.160]   It's like the actual technology is evolving by the minute.
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:24.440]   Like you have the new players, the story lines remain pretty much the same.
[00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:29.880]   The winners, the losers, the monopolies, you know, the Mavericks, but the names just
[00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:31.560]   changed, the characters change.
[00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:34.040]   And that's a great movie in a way.
[00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:35.040]   I think it's boring.
[00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:36.040]   I think it's boring.
[00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:37.040]   You think it's boring?
[00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:39.160]   I think that the people that just been doing it too long, John.
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:43.080]   No, no, I think the people that are in the business aren't nearly as interesting as they
[00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:46.160]   used to be when you had the Chuck pedals and you had.
[00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:47.160]   Oh, yeah, you're right.
[00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:48.160]   More.
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:49.160]   Who was the word star guy?
[00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:51.240]   And you had the Philippe Kahn who was a character.
[00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:52.240]   Oh, he was a carter.
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:53.440]   He was a Rubenstein, the word star guy.
[00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:54.440]   Yeah.
[00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:55.440]   And there's all these characters.
[00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:59.240]   Now you've got Steve Jobs and a bunch of guys who won't talk because they're the CEO
[00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:00.600]   and they're worried sick that's far-
[00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:02.960]   Andy Grove was the last interesting CEO.
[00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:03.960]   Right.
[00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:07.120]   And these guys won't say anything because they're afraid they're just the shareholders
[00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:10.720]   are going to hear about it or the SEC is going to get that smart.
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:11.720]   That's all.
[00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:17.040]   And the old boy of playing them with bourbon and saying, so what do you think of AMD?
[00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:18.040]   That's just stop working.
[00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:21.120]   No, I'm telling you, the other thing is these guys aren't interesting on the stage.
[00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:22.120]   They're boring.
[00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:25.880]   And except for the two guys that are good are Steve Jobs is still entertaining, but he
[00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:28.760]   doesn't do anything now because he's his health.
[00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:31.600]   And Larry Ellison has potential, but he doesn't want to.
[00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:35.880]   So we have a bunch of these CEOs that go out robotic like and they give their little
[00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:39.680]   spiel and a so dull that I don't even go to these things anymore.
[00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:40.680]   Oh, come on.
[00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:41.680]   Benny Off is a lot of fun.
[00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:42.680]   If you've heard of him.
[00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:43.680]   Benny Off is a lot of fun.
[00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:44.680]   I agree.
[00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:45.680]   Mark Benny Off.
[00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:46.680]   But he's the one guy.
[00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:47.680]   Okay, you got one.
[00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:48.680]   He's what sales force stuck.
[00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:49.680]   He's sales force stuck.
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:50.680]   Yeah.
[00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:54.200]   I'm saying he's like, he was pretty soon to stop showing up.
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:56.480]   So you agree on this is the same.
[00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:58.680]   It is a very tame industry now.
[00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:02.360]   But again, that doesn't mean it'll always remain tame, right?
[00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:05.560]   It's just we don't know whether people are showing up.
[00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:07.240]   The next generation could be funny.
[00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:12.160]   There's a lot of interesting young people out there who are doing things and someday
[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:15.400]   they'll get to be a big company.
[00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:20.600]   I'm not talking about people who are doing Twitter and Facebook, but people below, below
[00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:22.680]   the, you know, under the radar so far now.
[00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:24.000]   So they're interesting.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.280]   You know, our Kevin Rose is an interesting fella.
[00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:27.280]   You know, always fun.
[00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:29.280]   Part of the problem with that is John and I know him too well.
[00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:30.280]   Having worked with that.
[00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:31.840]   Yeah, I think that that might be true.
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:34.240]   We don't know him from a distance, but he is interesting.
[00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:35.240]   I agree.
[00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:36.240]   Yeah.
[00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:37.240]   Kevin has potentials being a celebrity personality.
[00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:38.880]   The fact he is.
[00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:40.840]   He gets a big audience.
[00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:41.840]   Zuckerberg.
[00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:42.840]   What about Zuckerberg?
[00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:43.840]   Couldn't he be?
[00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:44.840]   He's the boy.
[00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:45.840]   He's the boy.
[00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:46.840]   He's the boy.
[00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:47.840]   He's the boy.
[00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:48.840]   He's the boy.
[00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:49.840]   He's the boy.
[00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:50.840]   He's the boy.
[00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:51.840]   He's the boy.
[00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:52.840]   He's the boy.
[00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:53.840]   He's the boy.
[00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:54.840]   He's the boy.
[00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:55.840]   He's the boy.
[00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:56.840]   He's the boy.
[00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:57.840]   He's the boy.
[00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:58.840]   He's the boy.
[00:13:58.840 --> 00:13:59.840]   He's the boy.
[00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:00.840]   He's the boy.
[00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:01.840]   He's the boy.
[00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:02.840]   He's the boy.
[00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:03.840]   He's the boy.
[00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:04.840]   He's the boy.
[00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:05.840]   He's the boy.
[00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:06.840]   He's the boy.
[00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:07.840]   He's the boy.
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:08.840]   He's the boy.
[00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:09.840]   He's the boy.
[00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:10.840]   He's the boy.
[00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:11.840]   He's the boy.
[00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:12.840]   He's the boy.
[00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:13.840]   He's the boy.
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:14.840]   He's the boy.
[00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:15.840]   He's the boy.
[00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:16.840]   He's the boy.
[00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:17.840]   He's the boy.
[00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:18.840]   He's the boy.
[00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:19.840]   He's the boy.
[00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:20.840]   He's the boy.
[00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:21.840]   He's the boy.
[00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:22.840]   He's the boy.
[00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:23.840]   He's the boy.
[00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:24.840]   He's the boy.
[00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:25.840]   He's the boy.
[00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:26.840]   He's the boy.
[00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:27.840]   He's the boy.
[00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:28.840]   He's the boy.
[00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:29.840]   He's the boy.
[00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:30.840]   He's the boy.
[00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:31.840]   He's the boy.
[00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:32.840]   He's the boy.
[00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:33.840]   He's the boy.
[00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:34.840]   He's the boy.
[00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:35.840]   He's the boy.
[00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:36.840]   He's the boy.
[00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:37.840]   He's the boy.
[00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:38.840]   He's the boy.
[00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:39.840]   He's the boy.
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:40.840]   He's the boy.
[00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:41.840]   He's the boy.
[00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:42.840]   He's the boy.
[00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:43.840]   He's the boy.
[00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:44.840]   He's the boy.
[00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:45.840]   He's the boy.
[00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:46.840]   He's the boy.
[00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:47.840]   He's the boy.
[00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:49.840]   He walks in in a burka.
[00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:53.840]   Did you hear in London they're making women swimming burkas?
[00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:54.840]   Swimming burkas?
[00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:56.840]   Yeah, I don't think that's a good idea.
[00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:57.840]   That's beside me.
[00:14:57.840 --> 00:14:58.840]   They're trying to get rid of them.
[00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:00.840]   No, so I have 18 minutes.
[00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:02.840]   So I really don't need as many jokes.
[00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:03.840]   Oh, 18 minutes.
[00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:04.840]   It's a Ted talk.
[00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:06.840]   Marty Higgins could help me.
[00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:07.840]   Yeah.
[00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:08.840]   He's a comic.
[00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:09.840]   Yeah, he's on Skype.
[00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:10.840]   He can do a whole lot.
[00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:11.840]   Alright, I'm going to ask Marty to help me write some jokes.
[00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:12.840]   I'm really looking forward to that.
[00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:13.840]   TedX to buy if you get a chance.
[00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:14.840]   10-10.
[00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:15.840]   There's a lot of joke writers running.
[00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:18.840]   I'm going to go back into the, you know, into the, into the click.
[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:20.840]   You used to do something very funny.
[00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:24.840]   You'd make videos with your Amiga, your video toaster.
[00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:25.840]   Yeah, right.
[00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:27.840]   Which is a precursor to what I use.
[00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:28.840]   Yeah, it's a precursor.
[00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:30.840]   It's basically the same thing.
[00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:32.840]   They made a single, single change.
[00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:34.840]   It's an operating system.
[00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:36.840]   It's a, yeah, it's XP.
[00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:37.840]   It's an, an, an Amiga.
[00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:39.840]   Oh, do you do much public speed?
[00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:40.840]   You do, don't you?
[00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:41.840]   Not that much.
[00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:43.840]   I used to, but not anymore.
[00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:47.840]   What happened to the, the, the Omalik show on revision 3?
[00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:48.840]   Did you still do that?
[00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:49.840]   You had a hard attack.
[00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:51.840]   Yeah, I kind of had a hard attack still.
[00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:52.840]   I was still there.
[00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:56.840]   Pretty much, you know, so I, I kind of scaled back on that.
[00:15:56.840 --> 00:16:02.840]   We're trying to bring it back, but you know, I just, I'm a little bit of a perfectionist,
[00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:04.840]   so we're working on that a little bit.
[00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:08.840]   So hopefully by the end of the summer, we'll, we'll be able to bring it back.
[00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:10.840]   We're going to get you to do Twitter a few more times, Om.
[00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:13.840]   This is like public speaking, because you got this chat room.
[00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:17.840]   And that's, and there's eight or nine hundred peep, nine hundred and ninety seven people in the chat room.
[00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:18.840]   Kibbitzing.
[00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:19.840]   Kibbitzing.
[00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:20.840]   So I'll give you an example.
[00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:22.840]   I have nowhere web 577.
[00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:25.840]   Leo, you're ignorant of UK news.
[00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:28.840]   Did we mention anything about the UK here?
[00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:29.840]   I don't know.
[00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:31.840]   I think I don't know where that came from.
[00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:32.840]   All right.
[00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:33.840]   Thank you, web 577.
[00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:36.840]   So that's one thing you don't get in a, an audience.
[00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:39.840]   They're relatively tame compared to that.
[00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:41.840]   Big stories this week.
[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:43.840]   I'm sure there are some.
[00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:46.840]   I don't really have no idea.
[00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:48.840]   Did anything happen this week?
[00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:50.840]   Let me look back and see.
[00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:53.840]   You've just been basically putting this machine together all week.
[00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:54.840]   Yeah.
[00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:56.840]   I really haven't had a whole lot of time.
[00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:58.840]   See, see what's on the blog.
[00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:00.840]   Anything, anything big happened this week?
[00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:01.840]   I'm trying to think.
[00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:05.840]   Friend, maybe Om has something to say about Friend Feed and Facebook.
[00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:08.840]   Who's the, who's the, do you, do you, do you care about social media?
[00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:11.840]   At all, Om, I know you're on Twitter.
[00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:12.840]   Oh, I do.
[00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:16.840]   Actually, it's, it's, it's an interesting, you know, evolution of the web.
[00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:20.840]   And why shouldn't we, I think every should be caring enough for this thing.
[00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:26.840]   I think what we're seeing is, is the, the future of the media evolved and right in front
[00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:27.840]   of our eyes.
[00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:28.840]   I say media loosely.
[00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:30.840]   I say the future of information.
[00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:37.840]   And, and from that perspective, you know, services like Facebook, like Twitter, like Friend Feed are
[00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:38.840]   interesting.
[00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:44.840]   And I think the big change which might be going on in the web right now is that the, the
[00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:46.840]   information is being atomized, right?
[00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:52.840]   It's being, first we saw the rise of the blogs and, you know, singular blog posts.
[00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:58.840]   And now we've seen, then, then came the YouTube's and, and photographs being put on Flickr
[00:17:58.840 --> 00:17:59.840]   and all those places.
[00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:05.840]   And now we are seeing a pattern amongst people are sharing links to these things with, let's
[00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:08.840]   say using Bitly or some other URL shortener.
[00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:13.840]   And what you really are seeing is that the, the, the, the web is getting, you know, or
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:17.840]   the information web is getting, you know, sliced into little components.
[00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:23.840]   And the only way to aggregate it is through your social graph or recommendations from
[00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:28.840]   your friends and, you know, colleagues and that, you know, like, sort of like what shows up on
[00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:34.840]   John's blog is interesting enough for other people to read and go consume.
[00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:37.840]   And I think that's, that's a bit of a change which is happening.
[00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:41.840]   So from that perspective, I'm very keen on social media.
[00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:43.840]   There's more of a macro web perspective.
[00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:44.840]   Sorry.
[00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:45.840]   Too many words.
[00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:46.840]   No, I like that.
[00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:47.840]   No, I think that's exactly right.
[00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:51.840]   There is, there's a story that I want to, that I don't want to forget to mention.
[00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:54.840]   The, you know, the, one of the things that you're looking for a news item.
[00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:55.840]   I have a few.
[00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:57.840]   Well, you know about Apple.
[00:18:57.840 --> 00:18:59.840]   Oh, that story is great.
[00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:01.840]   You want to hear how I, nine thing?
[00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:02.840]   No, what's that?
[00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:03.840]   I would thought you were going to talk about the Google Apple FCC.
[00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:04.840]   No, no, I'm talking about.
[00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:06.840]   What's the nine nine nine thing?
[00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:09.840]   Well, Apple's going to have this meeting on not September nine.
[00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:10.840]   Now is that official?
[00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:12.840]   From what we can tell.
[00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:14.840]   Nobody's got an invite yet, but supposedly.
[00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:15.840]   They were shooting it in marine.
[00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:18.840]   They were shooting the commercials they're going to bring out and probably what's going
[00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:19.840]   to be at the show in the marine headlands.
[00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:20.840]   It's going to be the Beatles, right?
[00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:21.840]   Because number nine.
[00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:22.840]   Yeah.
[00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:23.840]   Number nine.
[00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:24.840]   Number nine.
[00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:25.840]   Number nine.
[00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:26.840]   So they're going to do a Beatles thing.
[00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:27.840]   They're going to have the Beatles catalog.
[00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:28.840]   They're going to have a bunch of rematter.
[00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:31.840]   Do you think they'll have Ringo and Paul at this event?
[00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:33.840]   Because it supposedly doesn't have an event at this, right?
[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:34.840]   Or nine nine.
[00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:35.840]   It's an interesting idea.
[00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:36.840]   I doubt it.
[00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:39.840]   Hey, Microsoft had Paul and Ringo.
[00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:42.840]   Well, Paul and Ringo are available.
[00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:45.840]   I don't think they're too busy.
[00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:50.840]   I think they got remastered to albums and they got some of the albums.
[00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:53.840]   Well, nine nine nine is when the rock band collection comes out.
[00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:54.840]   Right.
[00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:57.840]   And also there's going to be a new iPod design and one with the Beatles.
[00:19:57.840 --> 00:19:58.840]   We've been saying this on Mac Break.
[00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:02.840]   This is the Merlin Man rumor for the last two years, a yellow submarine iPod.
[00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:03.840]   Do you think it'll happen?
[00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:05.840]   I don't know if it's going to be yellow submarine bus.
[00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:06.840]   It might be.
[00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:07.840]   That'd be good.
[00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:08.840]   It's going to be something like that.
[00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:09.840]   That'd be good.
[00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:10.840]   Nine nine oh nine.
[00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:16.840]   So FCC letters have been released by Google AT&T and Apple.
[00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:20.840]   Remember the FCC said to all three.
[00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:21.840]   So what's the story?
[00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:23.840]   You rejected the Google voice application.
[00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:26.840]   And I talked about this in the radio show.
[00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:29.840]   It's like you got teenagers here.
[00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:33.840]   So so AT&T says no, I didn't do it.
[00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:37.840]   The FCC says did you did you tell me the truth AT&T?
[00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:40.840]   Did you tell Apple to reject the application?
[00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:42.840]   No, I didn't do it.
[00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:43.840]   That was their response.
[00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:45.840]   We have nothing to do with it.
[00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:48.840]   Apple did did AT&T tell you anything?
[00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:51.840]   Apple's intra Apple really is like a teenager.
[00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:54.840]   We did we didn't reject it.
[00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:56.840]   They literally said we didn't reject it.
[00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:57.840]   Yeah, I didn't do it.
[00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:58.840]   It's hilarious.
[00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:01.840]   We're still under study.
[00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:04.840]   They're like the Eddie Haskell of computing.
[00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:06.840]   It's like no Mrs. Cleaver.
[00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:07.840]   Oh no Mrs. Cleaver.
[00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:08.840]   We would never reject it.
[00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:10.840]   We're still studying that.
[00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:15.840]   And then Google, this is the weirdest part, redacted it.
[00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:16.840]   Their answer.
[00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:21.840]   So their answer was yes, we know why Apple rejected it, redacted.
[00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:22.840]   No, Google did that.
[00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:23.840]   It was AT&T.
[00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:24.840]   Google.
[00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:28.840]   So I know Steve Gilmore has a conspiracy theory about this.
[00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:33.840]   But, Ome, do you have any thought about what the Apple explained in detail why they rejected
[00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:34.840]   it?
[00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:36.840]   Google says redacted.
[00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:44.840]   I think this is, I think in many ways this is a Google inspired investigation.
[00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:51.840]   I don't think they have, unless they reveal what really is the issue.
[00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:53.840]   I don't really have a case, so to speak.
[00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:55.840]   I mean, it is the Apple's platform.
[00:21:55.840 --> 00:22:03.840]   Nobody really said on day one that they will allow a competitor to play in their house.
[00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:05.840]   So Google's a competitor.
[00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:07.840]   I mean, is it that they make an OS?
[00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:09.840]   They're making phones.
[00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:11.840]   They're making an operating system.
[00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:12.840]   They have a browser.
[00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:14.840]   I mean, they're a competitor.
[00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:16.840]   That's the post I wrote about this.
[00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:20.840]   It's a Google versus Apple posturing going on.
[00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:23.840]   FCC is just playing a little role in it.
[00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:26.840]   I think that's what really it is.
[00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:34.840]   People just don't want to admit that Google is as nefarious as any other monopoly in our
[00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:35.840]   time.
[00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:38.840]   Whether it was Microsoft or AT&T before that or IBM.
[00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:43.840]   Google has come to that point where it is don't do evil.
[00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:46.840]   It's like, oh, don't just try not to be caught.
[00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:48.840]   Don't be too evil.
[00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:50.840]   Don't get caught.
[00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:52.840]   Don't get caught.
[00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:54.840]   I kind of don't buy that.
[00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:55.840]   This is okay.
[00:22:55.840 --> 00:23:01.840]   You know, Apple, whether I like what Apple did, no, absolutely not.
[00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:06.840]   But I think Google is not above sin here as well.
[00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:08.840]   So I think that's what it is.
[00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:13.840]   And I think what you're really seeing is like, you know that documentary Planet Earth, which
[00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:20.840]   is like this beautiful scene of African elephant bulls fighting amongst each other.
[00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:23.840]   That's what this thing, the whole thing reminds me of.
[00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:28.840]   And remember, if African elephant bulls are fighting, you do not want to be the little native guy
[00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:30.840]   on the ground.
[00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:32.840]   Get the hell out of there.
[00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:34.840]   Or the cameraman.
[00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:35.840]   Or the cameraman.
[00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:37.840]   Get the hell away.
[00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:38.840]   Use a telephoto lens.
[00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:40.840]   I think it's interesting.
[00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:46.840]   I think Google was posturing in a way, look, Google probably knew, right, that Apple would
[00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:47.840]   say no.
[00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:50.840]   It's to underscore the freedom, and by the way, big announcement, Android's not, you know,
[00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:52.840]   anything you want in the Android store.
[00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:54.840]   It's to underscore the freedom that Google is offering.
[00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:55.840]   Yeah.
[00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:56.840]   I think it's a good idea.
[00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:57.840]   I think it's a good move.
[00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:00.840]   I think the Android phone is a clear, winter long term.
[00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:01.840]   Really?
[00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:02.840]   Oh, yeah.
[00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:04.840]   I think at some point it will actually overtake the iPhone.
[00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:07.840]   It has, it's got a way to go.
[00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:08.840]   Oh, yeah.
[00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:09.840]   No, I'm not saying tomorrow.
[00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:10.840]   It was the same thing with Apple.
[00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:12.840]   This is just a fractal.
[00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:13.840]   Apple starts off with the Apple II.
[00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:16.840]   They really get pretty much grab market share.
[00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:17.840]   Took a while.
[00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:18.840]   IBM PC comes out.
[00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:19.840]   Apple's still a dominant company.
[00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:21.840]   They welcome them.
[00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:26.040]   And then the next thing you know, the PC is beating them because of the closed nature of
[00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:27.040]   Apple.
[00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:31.120]   And then Apple does another, you know, holding a new platform and kind of owns it for a
[00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:32.120]   long time.
[00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:36.720]   The Macintosh, and then all of a sudden the Windows comes out and, you know, just essentially
[00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:38.640]   wipes them out overnight.
[00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:41.840]   And this is just another replay of the Apple's model.
[00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:43.720]   You know, they, they milk it.
[00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:44.720]   They make a lot of money.
[00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:45.720]   They have high margins.
[00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:48.120]   They just, not like they're starving to death.
[00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:51.880]   And at some point, because it's going to be easier for me to just do an app, like somebody
[00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:56.080]   pointed out in the chat room, something like, you know, 10,000 apps being received a day
[00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:58.080]   with 40 people reviewing them.
[00:24:58.080 --> 00:24:59.280]   What different, what should I even deal with it?
[00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:01.440]   Why don't I just put the app up on my own website?
[00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:04.600]   And if you want to run it on the Android, just download it and run it.
[00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:08.120]   I don't have, what should I have to go through hoops to set up?
[00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:12.680]   But Apple's point, and maybe it's a good point, is that if we do this, we'll control it.
[00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:16.480]   Then the consumer experience will be better because every Apple will be.
[00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:18.040]   Well, Macintosh is a better machine.
[00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:19.800]   Isn't that how you win by better?
[00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:23.920]   Well, it doesn't win work with even with the Macintosh is doing well, but it's still
[00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:25.680]   second way, second place.
[00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:26.680]   It's profitable though.
[00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:29.440]   Yeah, I'm not saying it's not the whole scheme is not profitable.
[00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:31.080]   Well, that's all I care about.
[00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:32.080]   Right.
[00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:37.640]   I think, John, I think you're, you're kind of all reaching a little bit here because,
[00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:43.520]   you know, Apple never said that they wanted to control all the market, right?
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:48.880]   They will continue to make a lot of money with iPhone and they, and this is not like
[00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:51.560]   the computer business.
[00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:53.440]   This is more of a phone economy.
[00:25:53.440 --> 00:26:00.520]   So they can sell like 40, 50, 60, 70 million phones a year and make a ton of money on their
[00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:03.160]   own existing platform.
[00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:07.160]   But they don't necessarily need to sell, you know, all the phones on the planet.
[00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:08.840]   Nobody does, right?
[00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:13.480]   And from that perspective, I think their strategy is okay where they're going with it.
[00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:18.160]   I think where they are messing up is that they have too much control on the app store.
[00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:22.080]   I think they need to kind of loosen up on that apart from that.
[00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:23.080]   I don't think they're going to do it.
[00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:24.800]   I'm not saying it's a bad strategy.
[00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:29.480]   I'm just saying that over in the long haul, the Android phone will win in terms of market
[00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:30.480]   share.
[00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:31.480]   Right.
[00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:35.200]   But Android phone makes no money for anyone except Google.
[00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:36.560]   Google doesn't need to make money.
[00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:38.800]   In fact, Android probably doesn't make money for Google.
[00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:40.560]   Google is all about eyeballs.
[00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:43.840]   Though they basically want people to use the search inside.
[00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:44.840]   Sideballs.
[00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:48.240]   You know, again, Google is not a proven thing, right?
[00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:55.720]   Like it's not, I mean, it's a 10 year old company and it still hasn't proven a secondary
[00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:58.480]   revenue line apart from advertising.
[00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:03.760]   So you know, it's very easy to kind of, you know, be in love with them, but they still
[00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:08.960]   have to show that they actually got ability to make revenue from anything above and beyond
[00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:09.960]   advertising.
[00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:12.160]   So that's my view on those guys.
[00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:13.160]   Yeah.
[00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:14.160]   Okay.
[00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:15.160]   Okay.
[00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:19.160]   And they're only evil to the extent that they have to be.
[00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:22.320]   You made us do the devil made us do it.
[00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:25.880]   But all monopolies actually end to that point where they become.
[00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:26.880]   Not really not yet.
[00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:27.880]   Google's a monopoly.
[00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:29.160]   60% of search.
[00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:36.360]   So, yeah, 65% of the search and growing still and, you know, so what is your alternative?
[00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:37.360]   Bing.
[00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:38.840]   Bing is the apple of search.
[00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:40.160]   I love Bing.
[00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:42.160]   What is your alternative?
[00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:43.160]   Ask.com.
[00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:44.160]   I don't know.
[00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:45.160]   I think Google.
[00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:47.240]   In fact, it always surprises me when I see 65%.
[00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:49.080]   I think, well, who are these other 35%?
[00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:51.000]   Who are these morons?
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   What are they using?
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   AOL search?
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   What are they using?
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.720]   They're using Bing, I guess.
[00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:56.720]   Yeah.
[00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:57.720]   I don't know.
[00:27:57.720 --> 00:27:58.720]   They're using Yahoo.
[00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:00.360]   A lot of people are diehard Yahoo.
[00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:01.600]   Well, then they're using Bing now.
[00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:03.160]   Well, they are using Bing now, right?
[00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:04.160]   Yeah.
[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:05.160]   Unfortunately.
[00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:06.160]   Yeah.
[00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:09.200]   You know, Yahoo has an out on that.
[00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:10.200]   Do they?
[00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:15.440]   They still have, they've kept their deal in China with Baidu.
[00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:16.440]   Baidu?
[00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:17.440]   Baidu, Baidu.
[00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:21.320]   And they, I think, are still continuing to develop the search engine in China.
[00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:22.320]   Oh, that's smart.
[00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:23.320]   And so they can like...
[00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:24.320]   I'm glad to hear that.
[00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:25.320]   The deal falls apart.
[00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:27.280]   They can come back and say, "Well, let's just go back there.
[00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:28.280]   Let's flip a switch and Bingo."
[00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:32.200]   To do any less than continue to develop in some skunk works way would be really...
[00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:36.440]   I think another thing that they should do, which I don't understand whether they haven't
[00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:41.000]   done this, is that they should have like, immediately, when they did the deal with Microsoft, done
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:46.320]   in a secondary deal with one of the other search engine companies and handed over their
[00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:50.240]   programmers and the search code to like, you know, one of these other...
[00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:51.240]   What's the crazy one?
[00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:53.040]   Clueless or whatever the name of it is?
[00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:54.040]   Clueless.
[00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:55.040]   I like that.
[00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:57.080]   I use Clueless search.
[00:28:57.080 --> 00:28:58.080]   I don't think that's the name.
[00:28:58.080 --> 00:28:59.080]   It could be.
[00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:01.080]   But they continue developing it.
[00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:02.080]   So if the Apple did it.
[00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:03.080]   Oh, cool.
[00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:04.080]   Cool.
[00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:05.080]   You're talking about the YL.
[00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:06.080]   Yeah, cool.
[00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:07.080]   Clueless is actually a good...
[00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:08.080]   So cool.
[00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:10.080]   Give it the cool and let them work with it.
[00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:11.080]   Is that...
[00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:12.080]   Wait a minute.
[00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:13.080]   I have to try cool.com.
[00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:14.080]   Because that can't still be around.
[00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:15.080]   Oh, yeah.
[00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:16.080]   Actually, it looks...
[00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:17.080]   Is that improved?
[00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:18.080]   It's actually...
[00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:19.080]   But who knew?
[00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:20.080]   Well, who knew?
[00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:21.080]   They did a check.
[00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:22.080]   They over promoted themselves at the beginning.
[00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:24.080]   Over promoted and under performed.
[00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:25.080]   Yeah, it's better.
[00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:26.080]   It's always the wrong way to go.
[00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:27.680]   But that would be a good thing to do.
[00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:29.080]   They could just give it to them.
[00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:31.080]   And then if the thing falls apart, they can just...
[00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:32.080]   What do you use?
[00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:33.520]   Do you use your name for a test search?
[00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:35.080]   I need a test search for cool.
[00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:36.080]   Yeah.
[00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:37.080]   Hey, it's my name all around.
[00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:39.080]   Because you know what the results are supposed to be.
[00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:42.080]   Yeah, I know what should be on there.
[00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:46.080]   Like if I type in John C. de Vorek and the de Vorek keyboard comes up as number one.
[00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:47.080]   I know the search engine sucks.
[00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:49.080]   That's a bad idea.
[00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:51.080]   Do you home have a tool?
[00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:54.080]   You know, a canonical search.
[00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:56.080]   I use just Google.
[00:29:56.080 --> 00:30:01.080]   But if you want to test cool, would you just type on Malick?
[00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:02.080]   Yeah.
[00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:04.080]   Or I'll use Gigome.
[00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:05.080]   That's probably...
[00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:08.080]   Yeah, because we all know what it's supposed to be.
[00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:09.080]   I type in Kirk Harnack.
[00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:11.080]   I got all my stuff.
[00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:14.080]   You want to do a good search.
[00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:17.080]   Type in white shirt.
[00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:18.080]   White?
[00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:19.080]   Two words?
[00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:20.080]   White shirt?
[00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:21.080]   White shirt.
[00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:22.080]   Yeah, just type that.
[00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:23.080]   One word or two.
[00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:25.080]   One word or two words.
[00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:29.080]   Okay, so I get just white shirts web store.
[00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:31.080]   The white shirt in New York social diary.
[00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:33.080]   Quick and easy stain removal.
[00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:35.080]   Keep your white shirts white and bright.
[00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:36.080]   Mrs. Stewart's blueing.
[00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:38.080]   But look at the map to your right.
[00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:39.080]   It's just off your screen, Leo.
[00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:41.080]   Oh, I get a map of white shirts.
[00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:42.080]   Nebraska?
[00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:43.080]   And India is there.
[00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:44.080]   Why?
[00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:45.080]   Why is India there?
[00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:46.080]   I have no idea.
[00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:49.080]   I thought it was a trick.
[00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:50.080]   You did that.
[00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:52.080]   No, so did you know that would be the result?
[00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:57.080]   No, I just think you compare it with Google and you'll see the results in Google.
[00:30:57.080 --> 00:31:01.080]   So you can always tell which results make more sense.
[00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:02.080]   Yeah.
[00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:03.080]   Compare Bing with it.
[00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:04.080]   You know, just a random phrase.
[00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:12.080]   I mean, you could type in range over, for example, and you'll get, you know, see if you get enough details about it.
[00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:13.080]   Here it is.
[00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:21.080]   The reason you get India is because you get the Maldives, a woman in a sarong, a men in a long-sleeved
[00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:22.080]   white shirt.
[00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:25.080]   The Google results are more interesting.
[00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:27.080]   You get ten fall fashion classics.
[00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:29.080]   You need to own white shirt.
[00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:32.080]   I got to do Bing because Bing should give me some shopping, right?
[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:36.080]   You have the Beast or Bobby Deluxe White Shirt Review at selectism.com.
[00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:38.080]   White shirt's good.
[00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:39.080]   You know what?
[00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:40.080]   All this is a really interesting result.
[00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:44.080]   The great white shirt is on Oprah.com.
[00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:47.080]   Fashion editor Stacey Wallace Albert.
[00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:52.080]   So if you're looking for what is a white shirt, you will never figure it out on any of these
[00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:53.080]   throughout the year.
[00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:57.080]   Oh, so if you, if what you were doing is trying to understand a phrase.
[00:31:57.080 --> 00:32:01.080]   I'm like, you know, if you want to buy one, you can't figure that one out.
[00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:04.080]   You want some practical tips about what is a great white shirt.
[00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:06.080]   You can't find it on any of these.
[00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:07.080]   I agree.
[00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:08.080]   I mean, I know I disagree.
[00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:12.080]   I, with the Google one, you get a lot of good answers that I think would tell you exactly what a white shirt is.
[00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:13.080]   Alright.
[00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:14.080]   Let's see Bing.
[00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:17.080]   I think Bing is actually getting the best results here.
[00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:20.080]   I think Bing is actually getting the best results here.
[00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:23.080]   I think Bing is actually getting the best results here.
[00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:24.080]   Yeah.
[00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:25.080]   There you go.
[00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:28.080]   I think Bing is actually getting the best results here.
[00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:29.080]   Yeah.
[00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:30.080]   There you go.
[00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:33.080]   I think Bing is actually getting the best results here.
[00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:34.080]   Yeah.
[00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:35.080]   There you go.
[00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:37.080]   I think Bing is actually getting the best results here.
[00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:38.080]   Yeah.
[00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:39.080]   There you go.
[00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:43.080]   I think Bing is actually getting the best results here.
[00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:44.080]   Alright.
[00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:45.080]   Back to the news.
[00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:46.080]   No, that's news.
[00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:47.080]   Well, for now, Bing got good results.
[00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:48.080]   And why not the present?
[00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:49.080]   Stop the present.
[00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:50.080]   That's huge.
[00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:53.080]   Well, for Matt, Al Fass, if I mean white Shirley.
[00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:54.080]   White Shirley?
[00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:56.080]   And what does it say to white Shirley?
[00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:58.080]   That's not that I'm interested in.
[00:32:58.080 --> 00:32:59.080]   It's names.
[00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:00.080]   Oh.
[00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:01.080]   The name white and the name Shirley.
[00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:02.080]   I see.
[00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:03.080]   Properly white.
[00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:07.080]   And it'll tell you 32% of the population is named Shirley White.
[00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:08.080]   Let's take a break.
[00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:11.080]   We're going to come back, talk more about the news.
[00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:15.080]   I'll give you all five minutes to find a news story.
[00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:17.080]   Well, I have this chat room chime in with you.
[00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:18.080]   Chat room news stories.
[00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:20.080]   I want to hear some.
[00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:24.080]   Meanwhile, ladies and gentlemen, go to meeting from Citrix.
[00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:27.080]   This is the software that we are using now at TWIT to collaborate.
[00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:30.080]   We use it on some of our shows for screenshots.
[00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:36.080]   It's the better way to meet with clients, with colleagues, to sell, to collaborate, to train.
[00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:40.080]   I love it and I want you to try it free for 30 days.
[00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:42.080]   Citrix is just a great company.
[00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:44.080]   They know how to do this stuff.
[00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:48.080]   They've created the best online meeting software.
[00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:58.080]   You know what's great is that when we first started talking about this a couple of years ago, I think 2004, a lot of people were using a lot of other solutions.
[00:33:58.080 --> 00:33:59.080]   Go ahead, John.
[00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:03.080]   Please be my guest.
[00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:08.080]   John, if we didn't have commercials, we would have had to invent them.
[00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:12.080]   Just for John, just so he could get up, wander.
[00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:14.080]   He doesn't have any cooking going on.
[00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:15.080]   He just wants to take off.
[00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:18.080]   Go to meeting is kind of the best of the breed.
[00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:24.080]   As we've been doing these commercials over the last five years, I see more and more and more people using Go to meeting.
[00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:26.080]   Now, I very rarely see anything else.
[00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:27.080]   Why?
[00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:28.080]   Because it's the best.
[00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:33.080]   Replace that online conference or the phone conference call with an online meeting.
[00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:35.080]   It's as good as meeting in person.
[00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:41.080]   You start your meetings with one click. Everyone sees your computer desktop on their computer screen so they see your PowerPoint.
[00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:44.080]   When Kirk was showing us what he was going to do with the Axia system.
[00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:50.080]   Now, Kirk, you could tell the truth. Did you do that because you knew I loved Go to meeting or do you use Go to meeting?
[00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:51.080]   No, I use it.
[00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:51.080]   You use it anyway.
[00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:52.080]   Absolutely pay for it every month.
[00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:53.080]   It's well worth it.
[00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:57.080]   You were able to show us the PowerPoint and everything you were going to do.
[00:34:57.080 --> 00:34:58.080]   You had diagrams.
[00:34:58.080 --> 00:34:59.080]   We could collaborate.
[00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:01.080]   We could say, "What about this and circle it?"
[00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:02.080]   That's just amazing.
[00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:08.080]   I want you to try it free 30 days free trial. Go to go to meeting.com/twit.
[00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:12.080]   In fact, I think we taped and broadcasted that Go to meeting that we did.
[00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:20.080]   We have it somewhere else. I'll see if I can bring it out because it's actually kind of fun to combine that, which was the planning stage with what you've done.
[00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:22.080]   And since then, it's just really neat.
[00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:24.080]   Go to meeting.com/twit.
[00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:28.080]   We thank them so much for their support of this week in Tech.
[00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:31.080]   Nice people with a great product.
[00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:34.080]   Oh, what's hot on your agenda these days?
[00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:37.080]   What are you paying a lot of attention to?
[00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:39.080]   Hmm.
[00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:41.080]   A lot of things.
[00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:47.080]   I think my big focus is the disaggregation of the web.
[00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:49.080]   I've written a lot about it.
[00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:55.080]   And I'm also trying to figure out what's the...
[00:35:55.080 --> 00:36:08.080]   There's a big trend for startups to develop their products for other people's platforms without taking into account what happens when those platform owners start mucking around.
[00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:12.080]   Well, start with Friend Feed, but Twitter is the one that leaps to mind, right?
[00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:16.080]   So you have Facebook and Twitter.
[00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:21.080]   So last week, a couple of companies shut down.
[00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:29.080]   It was just like one was a little startup called Lookery, and they kind of blamed Facebook for their troubles.
[00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:30.080]   Wait a minute.
[00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:33.080]   Now, Lookery was going to... was it an online ad play, right?
[00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:38.080]   And you had a little... in fact, I have Lookery code in my page, so I guess I'll take it out now.
[00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:39.080]   It was a little JavaScript.
[00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:41.080]   It was kind of like Google Analytics, and then they would help sell it.
[00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:43.080]   I never got any ads from them.
[00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:45.080]   How could they play in Facebook for that?
[00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:58.080]   Because they were initially for the Facebook platform, and then Facebook changed how the apps would interact with their news feed, and it got shifted from page one to page two.
[00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:04.080]   And it's actually thrown the whole Facebook ecosystem for a app ecosystem for a loop.
[00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:11.080]   And that's, I think, a big elephant in the room people don't want to talk about in the valley.
[00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:23.080]   And the same thing is going to happen, you know, all the troubles we are having with the iPhone platform, or the problems we are going to eventually end up having with the Twitter platform, who the hell knows what's going to happen.
[00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:32.080]   But a lot of the excitement and Silicon Valley's around these platforms, which are owned by corporations, right?
[00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:34.080]   Doesn't matter whether they're big or small.
[00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:43.080]   So I'm a little concerned about that, so that is definitely occupying a lot of my time right now, thinking about that and covering that.
[00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:55.080]   The other thing is I'm tracking, you know, what FCC is really doing about the broadband stimulus, and how we get more and more broadband to more and more Americans, and actually higher and higher speeds.
[00:37:55.080 --> 00:38:06.080]   And I think this is like one of my pet projects right now. So all of us are old enough to kind of have experienced the low bandwidth days.
[00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:21.080]   And I'm sure you remember when we went from 1200 bards to 9600 bards, and then from 9600 bards we went to 56,000 bards in dial up, and then we went to DSL.
[00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:28.080]   I think we are experiencing a similar 5X jump in bandwidth, which is coming our way.
[00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:36.080]   We are going to, like, you know, more and more people can access above 25 megabits per second to their house.
[00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:40.080]   They have to pay a lot of money, but you can access that.
[00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:50.080]   And you know, soon, maybe in 12 to 18 months, they're going to see the bandwidth prices come down and more, you know, higher speeds become more affordable.
[00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:54.080]   And when that happens, I think the web becomes even more interesting.
[00:38:54.080 --> 00:39:02.080]   So my theory is that every time we have a 5X gain in bandwidth, we have a lot of interesting things happen.
[00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:12.080]   So let me explain. So when we went from dial up to DSL/early cable modem, we got our cells Napster.
[00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:20.080]   And then we went from, remember, 384, and then we went to, like, 1.5 to 3 megabits.
[00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:26.080]   We got Skype, we got YouTube, we got WordPress, we got Facebook, we got a lot of interesting things.
[00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:29.080]   So we got Twit TV.
[00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:31.080]   We got Twit TV.
[00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:36.080]   And now you have, you know, your Twit is as big as tech TV.
[00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:37.080]   I mean, it's...
[00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:38.080]   Absolutely.
[00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:41.080]   And actually better bigger than them.
[00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:45.080]   With more bandwidth, more and more interesting things will happen.
[00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:47.080]   But what are you predicting?
[00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:53.080]   My prediction is that next 12 to 18 months, a whole new different class of applications are going to emerge.
[00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:54.080]   Specifically.
[00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:58.080]   You know, how about Google Wave? Now that doesn't need that kind of bandwidth.
[00:39:58.080 --> 00:40:01.080]   It's got to be rich. It's got to be rich bandwidth.
[00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:03.080]   What would you need?
[00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:05.080]   High def.
[00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:10.080]   I mean, you could say you could make this kind of analogy with hard disks because they got bigger, all kinds of different news.
[00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:11.080]   You think they were using it.
[00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:12.080]   No, it's interesting.
[00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:17.080]   But at some point, the hard disks now are going to terabyte after terabyte and nothing new is coming out.
[00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:20.080]   Is it possible that all these apps that, you know, that...
[00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:24.080]   The cutoff point was one point. I think you could make a point that cutoff point was 1.5 megabits.
[00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:27.080]   That enabled all you need.
[00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:28.080]   And I think...
[00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:32.080]   64 kilobytes is all anyone needs.
[00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:35.080]   Did you work for 18 to 10 more years?
[00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:37.080]   No, let's see.
[00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:39.080]   So, all right. So, let's say, what do you think the default will be now?
[00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:43.080]   Where are we going into the 5 megabit range, the 10 megabit range?
[00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:48.080]   Well, I think it is...
[00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:55.080]   By 2011, 2012, you will expect at least 25 to 40 megabits.
[00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:56.080]   Wow.
[00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:59.080]   Okay. So, what does the world look like when you have 25 megabits?
[00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:02.080]   See, that's what I've started to think about.
[00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:09.080]   Hey, you know what I would think about is not an asymmetric 25 megabits, but what if we get upload bandwidths higher?
[00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:10.080]   Right.
[00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:17.080]   That is a big, big issue. I think more and more people have started to talk about the upstream bandwidth.
[00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:21.080]   That's where people are gated right now, you know, with under 28 kilobytes.
[00:41:21.080 --> 00:41:22.080]   You can't do anything.
[00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:23.080]   Yeah.
[00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:24.080]   I got 5.
[00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:25.080]   So, what if people have 5...
[00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:28.080]   Then all of a sudden anybody can do what I'm doing.
[00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:30.080]   Anybody can be a broadcaster.
[00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:31.080]   That's interesting.
[00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:34.080]   But if you're a broadcaster now, they should pay more for the bandwidth and they get 5.
[00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:35.080]   Yeah.
[00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:37.080]   Well, if that becomes ubiquitous...
[00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:40.080]   Look, I think you're right, but I'm just to speculate here on this.
[00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:45.080]   I think... I've always thought that we are about to see a huge creative eruption.
[00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:46.080]   Mm-hmm.
[00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:47.080]   I'm waiting.
[00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:50.080]   A renaissance. I'm waiting for it, but I think you're starting to see it on YouTube.
[00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:53.080]   Wow, 100,000 videos a day on YouTube.
[00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:54.080]   Junk.
[00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:56.080]   That's a very subjective...
[00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:58.080]   No, it's not. It's not subjective.
[00:41:58.080 --> 00:41:59.080]   It's objective.
[00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:00.080]   They're objectively junk.
[00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:01.080]   Yeah, I'd say 99%.
[00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:05.080]   You think Fred Flinglehofer is junk, but a 14-year-old doesn't.
[00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:07.080]   Well, they're amused at the moment.
[00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:10.080]   They're amused that it's tuned to 30 million downloads.
[00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:12.080]   No, what good is it doing them?
[00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:14.080]   The point is that most of the stuff is crap.
[00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:15.080]   All right.
[00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:16.080]   I... You know...
[00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:19.080]   Besides your show, even with podcasts, most of its garbage...
[00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:20.080]   Most of its garbage.
[00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:22.080]   That brings up the...
[00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:24.080]   So not all this in pre-20 rule.
[00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:25.080]   The pre-20 rule.
[00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:26.080]   It's a bit more garbage.
[00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:28.080]   No, but it's inundated.
[00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:30.080]   It would be inundated with crap.
[00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:33.080]   I mean, to encourage this, I think we should go back to the modem.
[00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:37.080]   I think you're going to see a creative upwelling, and you're right.
[00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:38.080]   That's creative upwelling.
[00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:42.080]   90% will be crap, but 10% of a lot is more than 10% of a little,
[00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:44.080]   and I think you're going to see a lot more great stuff,
[00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:46.080]   and you're going to get those people...
[00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:47.080]   You're the optimist in the room.
[00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:48.080]   I always have been.
[00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:49.080]   Leo, here's an analogy for you.
[00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:52.080]   Back in the day when people had big high-fi systems
[00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:54.080]   and appreciated fine quality music.
[00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:55.080]   Which they don't anymore.
[00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:56.080]   We won.
[00:42:56.080 --> 00:42:57.080]   We would really...
[00:42:57.080 --> 00:42:58.080]   Deteriorate.
[00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:01.080]   Now we moved to the iPod, where my daughter has her cell phone in the backseat of the car.
[00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:02.080]   She's playing the latest fergie song.
[00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:03.080]   She has no idea.
[00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:04.080]   She thinks it sounds great.
[00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:05.080]   And I said, "That sounds terrible, Madeline.
[00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:06.080]   Where'd you get that?"
[00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:09.080]   "Oh, I held my cell phone up to my friend's cell phone."
[00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:10.080]   I was like, "Oh, good."
[00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:11.080]   Madeline, that sounds terrible.
[00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:12.080]   But wait a minute.
[00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:14.080]   No, but kids have always done that.
[00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:16.080]   The transistor radio and you and I were little.
[00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:17.080]   You're right.
[00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:18.080]   I had my help.
[00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:20.080]   I was a player up to the radio and the phone.
[00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:21.080]   Beach boys.
[00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:22.080]   Yeah, but still.
[00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:25.800]   But the expectation for audio quality is much lower than now than it used to be among the
[00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:26.800]   majority of people.
[00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:27.800]   I agree.
[00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:32.400]   Well, so what's the expectation of quality of content as it becomes easier to produce
[00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:33.960]   for the majority of people?
[00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:37.440]   Maybe the crap that we think is crap today will be seen as good.
[00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:38.440]   Nice to be used.
[00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:40.000]   And that's scary.
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:43.920]   Maybe the Taj Mahal of the future is being built out of pop-sick sticks right now.
[00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:47.920]   And I remember back when Quit was on the air and it was a good show.
[00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:50.000]   No, I get that already.
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.440]   We jump the shark every week.
[00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:53.440]   Every week.
[00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:55.120]   I've never seen a show jump the shark more often.
[00:43:55.120 --> 00:43:59.280]   So, what are you thinking increased bandwidth might lead to?
[00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:01.320]   I think you'll interesting applications.
[00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:06.560]   I think the gaming shifts into the browser because of that.
[00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:11.200]   I think the more upstream bandwidth means we will be able to do more and more interesting
[00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:12.200]   things.
[00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:13.200]   Like what?
[00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:15.040]   Virtual reality, baby.
[00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:16.040]   Yeah.
[00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:21.200]   No, for starters, being able to access your information, your information which is stored
[00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:28.640]   on your devices over the net rather than your information stored in somebody else's browser.
[00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:31.240]   So it's cloud computing you're talking about.
[00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:35.200]   My information is stored on my own machine, my own 10 terabyte drive.
[00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:36.200]   What's wrong with that?
[00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:37.200]   With that.
[00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:39.920]   But in order to access that, you still do need a big network, right?
[00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:45.760]   John, you can't really get it over a puny 128 kilobits upstream line.
[00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:47.840]   So you get more bandwidth that way.
[00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:52.080]   I think there is a whole new class of applications which are going to come.
[00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:57.320]   And if I could actually predict which is the right application, won't I be building it
[00:44:57.320 --> 00:44:58.320]   right now?
[00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:01.320]   Yeah, you will be.
[00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:02.320]   It is.
[00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:04.520]   We are in that big shift period.
[00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:10.840]   Like think about it here, you know, go back like every few years we have a 5x jump into
[00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:11.920]   bandwidth.
[00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:17.040]   And when that happened, a lot of interesting things start to happen from the application
[00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:18.040]   standpoint.
[00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:20.680]   Ken Shepherdsen says 3D LOL cats.
[00:45:20.680 --> 00:45:21.680]   That's the next big.
[00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:22.680]   That would be awesome.
[00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:23.680]   That would be awesome.
[00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:29.800]   Oh, do you think your prediction in bandwidth increase is applicable to third world countries?
[00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:34.480]   I deal a lot with people in Africa and some in the hinterlands of India and all over
[00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:39.960]   the place where they still have dial up sort of speeds even on their quote, high bandwidth
[00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:41.360]   connections.
[00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:42.360]   And thank you.
[00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:45.520]   Because I've had enough Nigerian email scams to last a lifetime.
[00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:46.520]   Yeah.
[00:45:46.520 --> 00:45:50.600]   Well, you know, I think more of the more people, whether it's in India or in Africa, they are
[00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:54.280]   going on the net using wireless devices.
[00:45:54.280 --> 00:45:59.240]   And so even in the wireless, if you come to think of it, we are seeing a big jump in
[00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:01.120]   bandwidth on the wireless end of things.
[00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:06.060]   So in India, for instance, you know, all at least three of the five major telcos are
[00:46:06.060 --> 00:46:09.400]   rolling out Wi-Fi networks in rural India.
[00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:14.760]   So that is also going to cause some kind of, you know, behavior change.
[00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:19.480]   It will also going to cause people to use their handle devices.
[00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:24.680]   I don't call them phones because they will also be looking for some lower cost, you know,
[00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:28.840]   iPhone type devices to get to access the internet.
[00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:34.480]   And I think there is, there is a lot of interesting things which can happen because as the bandwidth
[00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:37.480]   goes up, people's behavior changes.
[00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:41.960]   And through that behavior change, you get interesting application.
[00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:45.040]   You know, Google is a result of a behavior change.
[00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:51.280]   You know, Google changed is why we use Google is because it's easy to use Google because
[00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:52.920]   we are always on the web.
[00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:56.160]   And we don't have to kind of weaken, we don't find anything.
[00:46:56.160 --> 00:47:00.280]   We can search for it again using some different kind of a phrase.
[00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:05.120]   And I think that's one kind of a behavior change which happened with the increase in
[00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:06.120]   bandwidth.
[00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:09.680]   And you know, I don't think Google was a result of any bandwidth increase.
[00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:10.680]   It's popular.
[00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:11.920]   It's a better product.
[00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:16.680]   It's a better product which you can use more and more often because you're more and more
[00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:17.680]   connected.
[00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:19.080]   That's why it's become popular.
[00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:23.080]   So you're referring not just to higher speeds, but also more places to be connected.
[00:47:23.080 --> 00:47:24.080]   Exactly.
[00:47:24.080 --> 00:47:27.520]   So Bitcoin is as important if not more important than space.
[00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:31.400]   You know, you can have high speed networks in your house.
[00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:36.360]   That really doesn't mean more people connected to the net at higher speeds.
[00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:41.360]   So even on the wireless, if you look at it, we are going from about 300 kilobytes right
[00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:48.840]   now on like a low and 3G connection to like a 4G LTE connection which will give you between
[00:47:48.840 --> 00:47:52.240]   you know, 3 to 5 megabits to your handset.
[00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:53.520]   That's a big jump.
[00:47:53.520 --> 00:47:59.080]   And even in the third world countries where they are just rolling out wireless networks,
[00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:00.840]   you're seeing the big jump happen.
[00:48:00.840 --> 00:48:06.000]   I mean, the application wise, I think, you know, I'm sure once people have that kind
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:12.240]   of bandwidth within six to eight months, they'll start to figure out how to build, you know,
[00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:14.200]   things to consume that bandwidth.
[00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:19.320]   You know, it's pretty much like the processor and the operating system have more powerful
[00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:23.880]   of the processor until made Microsoft figured out a way to use it up, right?
[00:48:23.880 --> 00:48:26.240]   And then, and then until did another one.
[00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:31.520]   And you know, so you had the next generation of windows come out and that's how the bandwidth
[00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:34.120]   is the new processor in my opinion.
[00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:37.120]   And applications just, you know, come as a result of that.
[00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:38.480]   The network is the computer.
[00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:43.840]   You know, on on GigaOM.com about three-fourths the way down the page, roll out to Wi-Fi
[00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:47.480]   fleet wide in first quarter of 2010 on Southwest Airlines.
[00:48:47.480 --> 00:48:48.480]   Yeah.
[00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:50.640]   And it's up to 30 megabits to each plane.
[00:48:50.640 --> 00:48:51.640]   What?
[00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:52.640]   That's amazing.
[00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:56.440]   By satellite, I'm trying to figure that one out.
[00:48:56.440 --> 00:48:59.360]   And you still, but you still don't get a reserve seat.
[00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:02.800]   So I'm still not flying.
[00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:04.520]   So you don't find Southwest?
[00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:05.680]   That means you get to choose your seat.
[00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:07.160]   I try not to fly Southwest.
[00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:10.200]   That's where Virge, that's where Virge in America is just going to eat Southwest alive
[00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:13.000]   because you get a, you get, you still get the online bandwidth, but you also get a
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:14.000]   reserve seat.
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:16.800]   Leo, that's interesting because I fly Southwest because I get to pick my own seat.
[00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:17.800]   You prefer that?
[00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:18.800]   Absolutely.
[00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:20.120]   But you're smart enough to be in the group zero.
[00:49:20.120 --> 00:49:21.120]   That's the idea.
[00:49:21.120 --> 00:49:24.320]   No, it's because you go online and you get your boarding.
[00:49:24.320 --> 00:49:25.320]   Right.
[00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:26.320]   Yes.
[00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:27.320]   You get a group zero.
[00:49:27.320 --> 00:49:28.320]   Yeah.
[00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:29.320]   And all the people with screaming babies get to sit in the back.
[00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:31.520]   Because they're too stupid because they don't.
[00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:32.520]   Why?
[00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:33.520]   Yeah.
[00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:34.920]   That advantage is not going to last you very long.
[00:49:34.920 --> 00:49:39.200]   I'm sorry to say, but I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm too forgetful to get online.
[00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:41.000]   So I'm the back with the seats with the crazy screen babies.
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:42.000]   Yeah.
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:43.000]   That's what it's going to ask the website.
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:44.000]   Where's the service?
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:45.000]   Where's the service?
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:46.000]   Where's the website?
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:47.280]   You can go on and say, I'm going to be on this flight.
[00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:48.280]   Get me my boarding pass.
[00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:49.600]   Oh, that's a good service.
[00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:50.600]   Yeah.
[00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:52.440]   But Southwest doesn't charge you to change your flights.
[00:49:52.440 --> 00:49:54.800]   I, Leo, my trip here, I've changed flights three times.
[00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:58.600]   Well, see that's because you're at the top top dollar.
[00:49:58.600 --> 00:49:59.600]   No, the cheapest ticket.
[00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:00.600]   No, no, no.
[00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:03.840]   No, if the fare goes up, you pay the fare difference, but there's no hundred dollar
[00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:06.440]   charge as a service charge to change your flights.
[00:50:06.440 --> 00:50:07.440]   That's nice because United charges.
[00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:10.440]   And if you try, if flying international, you pay a two hundred dollar service charge a
[00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:11.440]   lot of time.
[00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:12.440]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:50:12.440 --> 00:50:15.960]   So let's talk about since people keep saying the chatroom that being mean to home.
[00:50:15.960 --> 00:50:16.960]   You're not being mean to home.
[00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:17.960]   That's what I said.
[00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:18.960]   This guy in the chat room.
[00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:19.960]   So I was being mean to you.
[00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:20.960]   Oh, rude.
[00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:23.280]   Home has John been mean to you?
[00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:24.280]   No.
[00:50:24.280 --> 00:50:26.680]   So let's talk about the Kundra thing you wrote.
[00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:27.680]   The vet Kundra.
[00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:28.680]   Oh, hold on.
[00:50:28.680 --> 00:50:30.240]   Hold your water on that.
[00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:33.600]   And I do want to get back to what you were talking about with the people building on
[00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:34.600]   unstable platforms.
[00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:37.720]   Because I think that's kind of, you raised a really interesting question there that's
[00:50:37.720 --> 00:50:38.720]   become very timely.
[00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:41.920]   But before we do that, I do want to mention our friends in Squarespace.
[00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:42.920]   Go ahead, John.
[00:50:42.920 --> 00:50:44.160]   Just walk right in front of the camera.
[00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:45.160]   Thank you.
[00:50:45.160 --> 00:50:47.160]   Just to have the camera up.
[00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:48.760]   You can squat on her.
[00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:51.200]   No, actually I tell everybody just to go right ahead.
[00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:53.560]   This isn't really a nobody's watching.
[00:50:53.560 --> 00:50:56.280]   Anyway, it's an audio podcast.
[00:50:56.280 --> 00:50:57.280]   I love it.
[00:50:57.280 --> 00:51:00.960]   There's all the seats are now empty in the studio.
[00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:02.640]   It's just, it's just you and me.
[00:51:02.640 --> 00:51:03.640]   You can get up.
[00:51:03.640 --> 00:51:04.640]   Oh, there you go.
[00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:05.640]   You can go somewhere if you want to.
[00:51:05.640 --> 00:51:07.640]   Look at that.
[00:51:07.640 --> 00:51:08.640]   Nobody's here.
[00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:10.960]   Yeah, I switched to different sheet.
[00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:12.520]   My batteries were running down.
[00:51:12.520 --> 00:51:13.520]   There you go.
[00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:14.520]   There you go.
[00:51:14.520 --> 00:51:15.520]   I'm a MacBook Pro.
[00:51:15.520 --> 00:51:16.520]   All right.
[00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:17.520]   Poor guy.
[00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:18.760]   We've worn them out.
[00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:22.680]   I just want to talk briefly about Squarespace and then we will get to there's, you know,
[00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:26.520]   it turns out first sometimes the shows that are the most interesting ones were the least
[00:51:26.520 --> 00:51:29.040]   news and we could talk about issues.
[00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:35.560]   But I do want to mention Squarespace for those of you looking to set up a website.
[00:51:35.560 --> 00:51:36.560]   Who do you use?
[00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:38.080]   What do you use OAM for your provider?
[00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:39.080]   Here's it.
[00:51:39.080 --> 00:51:40.080]   This is a good question.
[00:51:40.080 --> 00:51:41.880]   I use WordPress.com.
[00:51:41.880 --> 00:51:42.880]   Really?
[00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:43.880]   Yeah.
[00:51:43.880 --> 00:51:48.120]   Talk about building on a platform that may go away at any time.
[00:51:48.120 --> 00:51:49.120]   You don't serve.
[00:51:49.120 --> 00:51:50.760]   You don't host your own stuff.
[00:51:50.760 --> 00:51:55.880]   No, but you know, it's an open platform so I can get my information off whenever I want.
[00:51:55.880 --> 00:51:56.880]   That's true.
[00:51:56.880 --> 00:51:57.880]   It takes a minute.
[00:51:57.880 --> 00:52:00.000]   Like literally it's just a minute process.
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:05.080]   So the whole gig of OAM network is built on a free system.
[00:52:05.080 --> 00:52:06.080]   We pay for it.
[00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:07.840]   Like it's a paid service or business.
[00:52:07.840 --> 00:52:08.840]   They have business class.
[00:52:08.840 --> 00:52:09.840]   Yeah.
[00:52:09.840 --> 00:52:12.640]   There's a business class service and they call it VIP hosting.
[00:52:12.640 --> 00:52:18.800]   I'll use that and I use MOSO for some of our non-critical stuff.
[00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:20.600]   We use MOSO for now.
[00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:21.600]   So those are two services.
[00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:22.600]   I'm going to work on you.
[00:52:22.600 --> 00:52:23.600]   I'm going to move you over.
[00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:27.240]   I'm going to get you moved over to Squarespace.
[00:52:27.240 --> 00:52:28.440]   Have you looked at it ever?
[00:52:28.440 --> 00:52:29.440]   I have.
[00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:32.320]   I know the guy that actually wrote about him back in the day.
[00:52:32.320 --> 00:52:34.080]   Anthony and Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan.
[00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:37.560]   They're great people, great young guys who had a better idea.
[00:52:37.560 --> 00:52:38.720]   They're kind of like Matt Mullen-Wig.
[00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:39.720]   I look.
[00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:40.720]   I love Matt too.
[00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:47.680]   Squarespace is about, not just a blog, but about creating a website based on a Java machine
[00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:52.560]   virtual engine so that as bandwidth requirements go up, they just flip a switch, more servers
[00:52:52.560 --> 00:52:53.560]   come online.
[00:52:53.560 --> 00:52:55.480]   It's all distributed across all the servers.
[00:52:55.480 --> 00:52:58.000]   So they're very responsive.
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:52:59.000]   Design is unbelievable.
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:02.240]   I mean, they've got great templates to start with, but then you just drag and drop lots
[00:53:02.240 --> 00:53:03.240]   of Ajax.
[00:53:03.240 --> 00:53:05.000]   You can create your own design about as easily.
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:06.400]   You don't have to be designer.
[00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:07.600]   You don't have to be a programmer.
[00:53:07.600 --> 00:53:08.600]   Boom.
[00:53:08.600 --> 00:53:11.560]   So you're a programmer, full access to CSS templates.
[00:53:11.560 --> 00:53:13.680]   You could embed JavaScript.
[00:53:13.680 --> 00:53:17.480]   You really have a very complete flexible situation.
[00:53:17.480 --> 00:53:26.040]   And I love the idea that you can import and export right away from WordPress, from TypePad,
[00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:27.600]   from Blogger.
[00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:29.640]   They just, and export right back out.
[00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:32.560]   So just, you know, as you say, you're never trapped inside.
[00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:37.000]   I want, if you're looking to start up a system, whether it's a multi-blog system like Ohm's
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:43.240]   doing or a single page for yourself, a photo blog, I mean, a forum, I want you to try it
[00:53:43.240 --> 00:53:44.240]   free.
[00:53:44.240 --> 00:53:46.040]   Squarespace.com/twit.
[00:53:46.040 --> 00:53:53.960]   These are smart guys have created, I think, created the next generation platform for websites,
[00:53:53.960 --> 00:53:57.480]   Google Mac integration, social networking and immigration, and the stuff that they're rolling
[00:53:57.480 --> 00:54:01.920]   out, you know, every day something new really keeps it up to date.
[00:54:01.920 --> 00:54:04.160]   Go to squarespace.com/twit.
[00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:07.600]   Try it free, no credit card, it needed, and if you use the coupon code twit, you'll get
[00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:10.600]   10% off when you sign up.
[00:54:10.600 --> 00:54:15.320]   Squarespace is the future of the web.
[00:54:15.320 --> 00:54:17.640]   So Ohm, I like this when you're talking about building a platform.
[00:54:17.640 --> 00:54:19.720]   You know what, what's this, John?
[00:54:19.720 --> 00:54:23.160]   John found a Zephyr and he's taking it home.
[00:54:23.160 --> 00:54:25.040]   I think that's over Kirk's dead body.
[00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:28.320]   That's the new IP version of your ISD N codec.
[00:54:28.320 --> 00:54:29.320]   That works over IP.
[00:54:29.320 --> 00:54:32.040]   You know, it's cool about that, John.
[00:54:32.040 --> 00:54:36.920]   It's that as you may or may not know, it's getting harder and harder to get an ISD N line.
[00:54:36.920 --> 00:54:40.160]   Phone companies don't want to do ISD N lines.
[00:54:40.160 --> 00:54:44.200]   The other day, Leo, you looked at my Squarespace beginning website.
[00:54:44.200 --> 00:54:47.400]   Or you know Squarespace where I misspelled podcast.
[00:54:47.400 --> 00:54:49.400]   You pointed out it says, "Pocast."
[00:54:49.400 --> 00:54:51.680]   That's right, you're using Squarespace for your podcast.
[00:54:51.680 --> 00:54:52.680]   Just now fix it.
[00:54:52.680 --> 00:54:53.680]   Well, I don't have a podcast yet.
[00:54:53.680 --> 00:54:54.680]   It's coming up from Kentucky, right?
[00:54:54.680 --> 00:54:55.680]   Pocast, that's what I said.
[00:54:55.680 --> 00:54:56.680]   It should be that's Nashville.
[00:54:56.680 --> 00:54:57.680]   That's Nashville, Tennessee.
[00:54:57.680 --> 00:54:58.680]   You got a po-boy?
[00:54:58.680 --> 00:54:59.680]   It's Pocast.
[00:54:59.680 --> 00:55:01.880]   We got Pocast here, which is a good Kentucky burger.
[00:55:01.880 --> 00:55:04.200]   No, I think Pocast is good.
[00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:05.200]   Do you like Squarespace?
[00:55:05.200 --> 00:55:06.760]   You've been happy with it.
[00:55:06.760 --> 00:55:07.760]   Absolutely.
[00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:09.640]   Just playing with it, there's so much to learn.
[00:55:09.640 --> 00:55:10.640]   I don't know.
[00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:15.400]   Not to interrupt the news thing, but talking about the ISD N box.
[00:55:15.400 --> 00:55:18.960]   Are they going to, since they can't get ISD N anymore, it's getting more difficult.
[00:55:18.960 --> 00:55:20.800]   IP, public network.
[00:55:20.800 --> 00:55:26.280]   Are the radio stations going to be hooked up properly so you can use just straight IP
[00:55:26.280 --> 00:55:27.280]   into them?
[00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:29.280]   Well, for remote broadcasting?
[00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:33.360]   There's two different kinds of IP codecs out in the broadcast market now.
[00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:38.120]   There's kind of dumb ones that require router setup and you got to underutilize the bandwidth
[00:55:38.120 --> 00:55:40.000]   or over-specify the bandwidth.
[00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:41.960]   Then there's this one.
[00:55:41.960 --> 00:55:45.440]   And Telus makes the dumb ones, and a lot of other companies do, too.
[00:55:45.440 --> 00:55:48.640]   This is a smart one, a smart IP, that it works kind of like Skype.
[00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:50.960]   It gives you a buddy list.
[00:55:50.960 --> 00:55:54.760]   We have a rendezvous server that keeps track of where the studios are that you're supposed
[00:55:54.760 --> 00:55:55.760]   to connect to.
[00:55:55.760 --> 00:55:57.080]   So you just highlight the name of the studio.
[00:55:57.080 --> 00:55:58.320]   Do you have to have a Telus in it or...?
[00:55:58.320 --> 00:55:59.320]   They've got to have the same one.
[00:55:59.320 --> 00:56:00.320]   Yeah.
[00:56:00.320 --> 00:56:01.320]   Ooh.
[00:56:01.320 --> 00:56:02.320]   Well, how many studios?
[00:56:02.320 --> 00:56:03.320]   How many give me a number?
[00:56:03.320 --> 00:56:05.440]   I think we've sold probably 400 of them so far.
[00:56:05.440 --> 00:56:10.560]   You know where they're starting to use in recording studios because you want to do a
[00:56:10.560 --> 00:56:14.000]   multi-track recording and the musicians are all over the place.
[00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:15.400]   And they're not going to have ISD N lines.
[00:56:15.400 --> 00:56:16.400]   Let's face it.
[00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:17.400]   They used to.
[00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:18.400]   But not at all.
[00:56:18.400 --> 00:56:19.400]   They used to.
[00:56:19.400 --> 00:56:21.520]   More and more you're seeing in the recording studios, this kind of thing.
[00:56:21.520 --> 00:56:23.040]   They do virtual recordings?
[00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:25.040]   Yeah.
[00:56:25.040 --> 00:56:28.000]   The musicians are in different states.
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:30.000]   They're putting headphones on and they jam.
[00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:31.000]   It's a remark.
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:33.000]   But there's even a web that's based on what it is.
[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:34.400]   There's no way about the latency.
[00:56:34.400 --> 00:56:35.400]   That can be a problem.
[00:56:35.400 --> 00:56:39.560]   One way to solve that is to just get with the other guys over the web but make a local
[00:56:39.560 --> 00:56:43.120]   recording and then FTP or send in the local high quality recording.
[00:56:43.120 --> 00:56:44.120]   You do double-high quality.
[00:56:44.120 --> 00:56:46.280]   But we've actually played with a lot of different ways to do this.
[00:56:46.280 --> 00:56:49.880]   Steve Gibson was writing a ring recorder that would send...
[00:56:49.880 --> 00:56:54.280]   So you drop packets, what you're listening to, you drop packets, but the ring recorder
[00:56:54.280 --> 00:57:00.000]   waits until it reassembles it once that packet comes in and has some redundancy so that
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:03.280]   even if you drop a packet you eventually get a perfect recording.
[00:57:03.280 --> 00:57:07.920]   It may not be in real time but you can have a real time kind of imperfect audition channel.
[00:57:07.920 --> 00:57:09.840]   I don't know if you guys don't do that though, Kurt.
[00:57:09.840 --> 00:57:11.000]   No, that's pretty cool with Steve.
[00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:12.000]   Don't we all talk to him?
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:13.000]   Yeah.
[00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:14.000]   It's a neat idea.
[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:15.000]   So let's talk about building on platforms.
[00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:17.960]   You know, one of the things that we've talked about this on a couple of times on this
[00:57:17.960 --> 00:57:19.640]   weekend, Google, is the idea...
[00:57:19.640 --> 00:57:22.160]   It seems to be in the last couple of weeks.
[00:57:22.160 --> 00:57:29.040]   It seems to be with the realization that a lot of these platforms, not just for applications,
[00:57:29.040 --> 00:57:35.000]   but even for individuals that we're building on, are shaky with a friend field feed sale
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:38.960]   to Facebook, Twitter's, you know, multiple fail whales.
[00:57:38.960 --> 00:57:41.400]   Facebook who knows what they're doing, people are starting to say, "Maybe I should be doing
[00:57:41.400 --> 00:57:43.920]   my blog again."
[00:57:43.920 --> 00:57:47.240]   There's this kind of return to sanity almost.
[00:57:47.240 --> 00:57:48.240]   I blog less.
[00:57:48.240 --> 00:57:53.840]   I noticed a lot of people blog less because we were microblogging, but we started to realize
[00:57:53.840 --> 00:57:57.880]   we're pumping all this equity into somebody out there that doesn't...
[00:57:57.880 --> 00:57:59.800]   We have no share in.
[00:57:59.800 --> 00:58:00.800]   Do you see that?
[00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:01.800]   I think that's...
[00:58:01.800 --> 00:58:03.120]   Yeah, I agree with you on that.
[00:58:03.120 --> 00:58:07.040]   I think people should listen to Dave Weiner more often.
[00:58:07.040 --> 00:58:08.040]   I have to be very honest.
[00:58:08.040 --> 00:58:09.600]   Dave's the leader on this one, yeah.
[00:58:09.600 --> 00:58:14.240]   No, he was saying this a long time ago.
[00:58:14.240 --> 00:58:21.920]   And I think blog is the epicenter of the digital existence, at least for people who like to
[00:58:21.920 --> 00:58:23.520]   publish on the web.
[00:58:23.520 --> 00:58:30.120]   So there's a lot of people who just want to be friends with other people and publish
[00:58:30.120 --> 00:58:32.080]   amongst their friends.
[00:58:32.080 --> 00:58:37.760]   For them, Facebook might be interesting, but for people who are like me or like John or
[00:58:37.760 --> 00:58:44.160]   like you, I think blog should and always will be the most crucial place for us because
[00:58:44.160 --> 00:58:47.040]   that's where we can bring everything together.
[00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:52.720]   But I think the bigger challenge here is that the blogs need to evolve from what they were.
[00:58:52.720 --> 00:58:59.000]   They started off as content management systems with some level of discussion attached to them,
[00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:01.560]   but now they need to go more than that.
[00:59:01.560 --> 00:59:02.560]   And I think they...
[00:59:02.560 --> 00:59:09.040]   And what I mean by that is they need to kind of embrace the fact that we publish more in
[00:59:09.040 --> 00:59:10.040]   different ways.
[00:59:10.040 --> 00:59:11.040]   We publish photos.
[00:59:11.040 --> 00:59:12.040]   We publish videos.
[00:59:12.040 --> 00:59:13.760]   We publish tweets.
[00:59:13.760 --> 00:59:15.760]   And we publish them from our cell phones.
[00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:18.400]   And we publish them not from a computer.
[00:59:18.400 --> 00:59:25.040]   And we are always interacting with our blog or what we publish in a very different sort
[00:59:25.040 --> 00:59:26.040]   of a way.
[00:59:26.040 --> 00:59:29.080]   It's more of a live stream than just a blog.
[00:59:29.080 --> 00:59:31.480]   And I think people...
[00:59:31.480 --> 00:59:36.560]   The people who make tools for these platforms, whether it's WordPress or Six Apart, they
[00:59:36.560 --> 00:59:41.480]   need to kind of just take a step back and say, "Okay, how do we evolve this technology?"
[00:59:41.480 --> 00:59:43.360]   And I think that's the crucial part.
[00:59:43.360 --> 00:59:49.840]   You know, creating more of a conversation platform than just a random publishing platform.
[00:59:49.840 --> 00:59:56.880]   So the point is, you can publish as many photos as you want, but if nobody sees it, who cares?
[00:59:56.880 --> 01:00:01.920]   Like even if your friends don't see the photographs you've taken, you're really whistling in the
[01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:03.760]   wind, so to speak.
[01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:07.360]   So that's where the blogging platforms need to evolve to.
[01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:12.160]   And I think hopefully in the last couple of weeks, all the stuff which has happened around
[01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:17.640]   Facebook and friend feed and Twitter, etc, people will start to pay more attention.
[01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:19.600]   I think that's the key part.
[01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:20.600]   It's interesting.
[01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:23.880]   You should mention Six Apart because we had a Neil Dash on when we were talking about
[01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:24.880]   this on Twig.
[01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:26.040]   And that's exactly what a Neil said.
[01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:29.800]   I have a feeling companies like Six Apart are going to...
[01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:33.000]   It's kind of a thorny problem, but I think they are going to address this.
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:37.560]   I think it's a mixture of the blog and some sort of social media.
[01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:39.760]   I think John might have some ideas about that.
[01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:40.760]   You know, I'm not...
[01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:41.760]   He hates everything.
[01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:43.760]   I don't hate everything.
[01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:47.080]   I think there's a couple of things going on with blogs.
[01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:48.080]   When it says...
[01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:49.080]   They're crap.
[01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:50.080]   That's the problem.
[01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:54.120]   They never started off as content managers per se, but they were.
[01:00:54.120 --> 01:00:55.120]   They ended up being.
[01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:56.120]   Yeah.
[01:00:56.120 --> 01:00:58.560]   And the thing that I think is missing is the variety.
[01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:00.120]   I think this is what the problem is.
[01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:02.640]   There's still a blog model with it.
[01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:04.240]   Last in, first out, kind of.
[01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:06.240]   Last thing you post is at the top, so everything's backwards.
[01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:07.240]   You want some sort of random?
[01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:10.280]   So if you did a five part series, you have to read part five.
[01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:11.280]   Yeah, that's backwards.
[01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:12.280]   It's ridiculous.
[01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:14.960]   No, I think there should be something called a new-voe blog, and you're starting to see
[01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:19.440]   them now, which are these templates which turn the blog into what looks like a magazine
[01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:20.440]   or a publication.
[01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:21.440]   Yes.
[01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:25.000]   And so you can have fixed areas that don't really change, and you can have a rotation
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.000]   of photos.
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:30.320]   I mean, there's no reason that the New York Times can't be a blog template.
[01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:32.040]   And in fact, Facebook is a matter of fact...
[01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:35.800]   Not Facebook, I'm sorry, but the deal book in the back of the New York Times is, in fact,
[01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:38.040]   a WordPress blog.
[01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:42.320]   And it's been jiggered around to look like just a section of columns.
[01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:48.640]   So I think the potential for blogs to move ahead into the next generation where they
[01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:54.800]   become more than just a simple one thing that runs down to China with your posts and the
[01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:59.560]   most recent posts going last, I think the model is tired.
[01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:06.120]   What about this notion that both Neil and Om were talking about with the fact that the
[01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:08.640]   blog is kind of an island in the middle of nowhere.
[01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:12.520]   If you don't get this kind of, not merely people going to your blog, but this kind of,
[01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:18.480]   you need some sort of social media like flow and interaction around it.
[01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:20.840]   The comments are so static.
[01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:22.320]   Is there some way to make this be more...
[01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:23.480]   Let's see why there's more social.
[01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:28.240]   I'd like to see some different models that would maybe incorporate social mechanism that
[01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:29.240]   was a little more active.
[01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:34.160]   I mean, I like the idea that some of the blogs, there's a lot of plugins now that some people
[01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:35.160]   use.
[01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:36.160]   I like the echo of my blog.
[01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:37.600]   It's a new commenting engine.
[01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:38.600]   It's really amazing.
[01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:39.600]   And there's really...
[01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:40.600]   Yeah.
[01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:44.240]   It's like to discuss because it pulls in comment...
[01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:48.200]   I don't know how from Twitter, from Friend Feed, from everywhere else, become part of your
[01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:49.480]   comment stream.
[01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:50.640]   So you're not losing your...
[01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:53.880]   You still have a locus, but you're including everything.
[01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:55.680]   This is the first step in that direction.
[01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:59.720]   I've seen a lot of blogs that have the Twitter feed on their front page and other kinds of
[01:02:59.720 --> 01:03:03.040]   things which make it look a little more interesting.
[01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:04.800]   I don't know.
[01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:12.080]   What I'm just getting tired of is the last in first out process where you have the thing
[01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:16.480]   at the top and it just scrolls down to the infinity.
[01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:20.840]   That comes from this kind of misapprehension that you're really a link blog.
[01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:23.080]   I think it came from the diary thing.
[01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:24.080]   Yeah.
[01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:25.080]   It's a diary issue.
[01:03:25.080 --> 01:03:26.080]   It's a journal.
[01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:27.080]   Yeah, a journal.
[01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:28.080]   And I don't think there's that many...
[01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:32.600]   There's a lot of people who like to write a journal which is fine.
[01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:33.760]   I don't have a problem with it.
[01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:35.920]   I think most of them are uninteresting.
[01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:36.920]   But...
[01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:41.120]   Someone like Deuce has done a great job with that.
[01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:46.200]   There's dozens of really good journal style blogs that are kind of interesting to read.
[01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:50.720]   But why does every blog have to be like that?
[01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:52.200]   And the versatility when it comes...
[01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:53.640]   When you do get a template that...
[01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:56.800]   And there's a couple of guys that do these real wild templates that make it...
[01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:57.800]   Revolution is what I use.
[01:03:57.800 --> 01:03:58.800]   Revolution is what I use.
[01:03:58.800 --> 01:03:59.800]   Revolution is what I use.
[01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:00.800]   It's really neat.
[01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:01.800]   It's really neat.
[01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:03.880]   It's a figure out you got to watch all the videos.
[01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:04.880]   It's really a...
[01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:05.880]   It's a difficult...
[01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:07.880]   So you're a life-o blog.
[01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:08.880]   Last time, first out.
[01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:09.880]   Do you want to change the world?
[01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:10.880]   I'm changing it slightly.
[01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:15.600]   But I'm still going to be a life-o-one sign that's going to be more stagnant stuff around
[01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:16.600]   it.
[01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:17.360]   But yeah, I know I'd like to change it.
[01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:19.600]   But it's a blog.
[01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:22.040]   I mean, which is what it looks like.
[01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:25.120]   I mean, at some point you want to say, well, maybe I don't want it to look like a blog
[01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:27.920]   anymore because there are credibility issues.
[01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:31.400]   Don't have the same credibility as stagnant pages.
[01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:33.040]   Oh, I don't know, John.
[01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:36.480]   I think that ship is saying the long path.
[01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:40.880]   It's people like you and me and Leo, but in fact, the general public, if they...
[01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:41.880]   I always say this.
[01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:42.880]   If you were...
[01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:46.320]   Say you took the New York Times and you took a blog and you have the blog that's scrolling
[01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:49.720]   and you take the exact same article and you put it on the front page of the New York Times,
[01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:51.640]   it's kind of a stagnant spot.
[01:04:51.640 --> 01:04:53.360]   And then you have it on the blog.
[01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:57.720]   And you take somebody in some blind test, you take a big population of people and see
[01:04:57.720 --> 01:05:00.200]   which of those two has the most credibility.
[01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:01.200]   If you had a credibility...
[01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:02.200]   It's not just credibility.
[01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:03.200]   It's readability.
[01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:04.200]   Go to...
[01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:05.200]   Here's an exercise.
[01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:07.400]   Go to omg.yahoo.com.
[01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:09.000]   We talked about this a couple of weeks ago.
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:10.040]   I had never heard of it.
[01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:12.120]   It's bigger than TMZ.
[01:05:12.120 --> 01:05:13.600]   This is Yahoo's celebrity.
[01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:16.280]   And it is a blog, but it's not.
[01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:17.280]   It's Us Magazine.
[01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:19.720]   I mean, they really have figured out a way.
[01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:23.520]   It's time-based, but this doesn't look like a blog.
[01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:28.520]   You see a bunch of stories in a Hollywood Squares layout.
[01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:29.520]   Yes.
[01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:30.520]   Parachilden will say, "That's hot."
[01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:32.040]   I think this is a good design.
[01:05:32.040 --> 01:05:34.880]   Look at the advertisements intermixed with the tiles.
[01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:37.360]   They've got a pole in there.
[01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:39.920]   This kind of gives you an idea of...
[01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:40.920]   And it still has...
[01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:46.040]   You notice one of the squares is the latest and it's chronological, reverse chronological.
[01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:47.040]   By the way, this is huge.
[01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:48.040]   I can't remember.
[01:05:48.040 --> 01:05:49.640]   It was 40 million unique some month.
[01:05:49.640 --> 01:05:50.880]   I mean, I never even heard of it.
[01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:52.080]   I never heard of it till now.
[01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:53.080]   I know.
[01:05:53.080 --> 01:05:55.680]   We're not mavens of the sort of scene.
[01:05:55.680 --> 01:05:58.840]   And that's what I'm saying is this is real people.
[01:05:58.840 --> 01:05:59.840]   Real people use this.
[01:05:59.840 --> 01:06:01.480]   Not people like you, me, and Omen.
[01:06:01.480 --> 01:06:08.280]   Kirk, we were comfortable with the web memes.
[01:06:08.280 --> 01:06:11.120]   This is more like real people.
[01:06:11.120 --> 01:06:13.720]   To be honest about, this is actually quite crappy.
[01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:18.920]   I just was wondering how long it would take.
[01:06:18.920 --> 01:06:21.280]   I expected nothing less from you, John.
[01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:22.280]   Nothing less than all.
[01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:23.280]   You're not going to argue.
[01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:24.280]   I know that.
[01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:28.480]   But if you want Angelina Jolie news, I found it in two seconds.
[01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:32.000]   It achieves what it's intended to achieve.
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.480]   Ooh, there's my Miley Cyrus news.
[01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:35.480]   See?
[01:06:35.480 --> 01:06:36.480]   Miley.
[01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:37.480]   See what I'm saying?
[01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:38.480]   Look who's on the front page.
[01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:39.480]   Okay.
[01:06:39.480 --> 01:06:40.480]   Lindsay Lohan.
[01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:41.480]   I don't know who that is.
[01:06:41.480 --> 01:06:42.480]   Is that Mary J. Blyge?
[01:06:42.480 --> 01:06:43.480]   I don't know who that is.
[01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:44.480]   Safe-free.
[01:06:44.480 --> 01:06:45.480]   See, the problem is I'm not hip with this stuff.
[01:06:45.480 --> 01:06:46.480]   Is that Vanessa Williams?
[01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:47.480]   I don't even know who that is.
[01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:49.320]   Mille Jovovich.
[01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:52.400]   Some sort of baby makes shopping spree story.
[01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:53.400]   Real housewife.
[01:06:53.400 --> 01:06:57.800]   See, my problem is, and he's probably yours too, John, we have no idea who these people
[01:06:57.800 --> 01:06:58.800]   are.
[01:06:58.800 --> 01:06:59.800]   And we don't care.
[01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:00.800]   And nor do we care.
[01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:01.800]   And I think that's something we proud of.
[01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:03.960]   Because it's just promoted for people that really have nothing better to do with their
[01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:06.800]   time than follow somebody else's life.
[01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:07.800]   This is bigger.
[01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:11.120]   This is bigger than almost any other website.
[01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:13.960]   You and I have visited in the last two years.
[01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:14.960]   This is huge.
[01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:18.800]   Don't you want to read about Dina Lohan on Lindsay's home burglary?
[01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:22.240]   Yes, yes, I know you do.
[01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:23.240]   Alright, get the bourbon out.
[01:07:23.240 --> 01:07:26.480]   I need to write it at the time for a drink after that.
[01:07:26.480 --> 01:07:31.880]   So when you were talking to them about platforms and building on a week platform, building on
[01:07:31.880 --> 01:07:36.400]   Twitter, building on Facebook, I was thinking this is where Microsoft really succeeded.
[01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:44.320]   They made a platform that a developer could rely on that was consistent even cross-versions.
[01:07:44.320 --> 01:07:45.320]   And really we wouldn't be-
[01:07:45.320 --> 01:07:46.320]   What about Windows?
[01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:50.920]   Well, we wouldn't be where we are today if we didn't have that kind of rock solid platform
[01:07:50.920 --> 01:07:52.160]   to our developers.
[01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:54.800]   Where's the windows of the internet?
[01:07:54.800 --> 01:07:57.000]   Oh, tell them.
[01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:58.000]   Do you know?
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.000]   Don't-
[01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:00.000]   You should tell them that.
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.840]   Is that what we need, Oh, I mean, is that the response to be Chrome?
[01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:03.840]   Maybe it is.
[01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:04.840]   You think?
[01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:05.840]   No, I don't know.
[01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:06.840]   I doubt it.
[01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:07.840]   It's Google, man.
[01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:08.840]   Come on.
[01:08:08.840 --> 01:08:09.840]   Look at the track record.
[01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:13.040]   I mean, they've not done anything great.
[01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:14.560]   You know, they do a lot of things.
[01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:15.760]   They don't do anything great.
[01:08:15.760 --> 01:08:17.960]   I mean, a Gmail also has taken a long time.
[01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:18.960]   I'm not going to argue with you.
[01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:19.960]   I'm glad you're on my side.
[01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:21.520]   No, Google is the Emperor's new clothes.
[01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:23.360]   Google is this company.
[01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:24.960]   Everybody loves you.
[01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:27.120]   Since they're IPO evil, they do know evil.
[01:08:27.120 --> 01:08:32.360]   Since their IPO, 480% increase in value in five years was five years ago on Friday.
[01:08:32.360 --> 01:08:33.360]   That's the point.
[01:08:33.360 --> 01:08:34.360]   I mean, it shouldn't have been more.
[01:08:34.360 --> 01:08:39.320]   If it wasn't for the economic collapse, it would be at 7/5.
[01:08:39.320 --> 01:08:40.320]   Yeah.
[01:08:40.320 --> 01:08:42.400]   And yeah, it is kind of the Emperor's new clothes because you look at everything, all
[01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:44.400]   of Google's initiatives, they're all kind of half-baked.
[01:08:44.400 --> 01:08:45.400]   Yeah.
[01:08:45.400 --> 01:08:47.960]   A lot of them, they just dropped the ball.
[01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:48.960]   Dodge ball?
[01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:49.960]   Literally?
[01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:50.960]   Yeah.
[01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:51.960]   Dropped.
[01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:52.960]   Dropped the ball.
[01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:53.960]   Dropped the ball.
[01:08:53.960 --> 01:08:55.720]   And they had that catalog thing for a while and they just let that look.
[01:08:55.720 --> 01:08:59.120]   Let's talk about Google Books because that was a big story this week.
[01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:02.600]   Look, I'll give them a blank stare.
[01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:05.360]   There's a bunch of stuff that's happened with Google Books.
[01:09:05.360 --> 01:09:06.360]   Which one are you talking about?
[01:09:06.360 --> 01:09:10.600]   The fact that nobody's buying into their lawsuit, what their settlement is?
[01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:11.600]   Yeah.
[01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:12.600]   Yeah.
[01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:13.600]   And including, I might add, Microsoft and Yahoo.
[01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:15.360]   Did you get the letters from them?
[01:09:15.360 --> 01:09:17.120]   No, they were sending out letters?
[01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:18.120]   You didn't get the letters?
[01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:19.120]   I don't have any books.
[01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:20.120]   Do I have books on Google Books?
[01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:21.120]   You have a bunch of books?
[01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:22.120]   Yeah, you know.
[01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:23.120]   I probably do.
[01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:24.120]   Those wily books that you do.
[01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:25.120]   Yeah, 13 books on a few.
[01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:26.760]   Those 13 books where they gave you like 500 bucks a book.
[01:09:26.760 --> 01:09:27.760]   A book?
[01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:28.760]   It was a great deal.
[01:09:28.760 --> 01:09:29.760]   Put my picture on the cover.
[01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:30.760]   And no royal tea.
[01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:31.760]   Yeah, no, it was a great deal.
[01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:32.760]   Yeah, that book.
[01:09:32.760 --> 01:09:33.760]   Yeah, those books.
[01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:34.760]   The ones that would you do.
[01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:35.760]   Those are all on the shelf there, right?
[01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:36.760]   You paid no attention to my advice on this deal.
[01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:37.760]   Yeah, that one.
[01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:38.760]   Yeah, that one.
[01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:39.760]   So they're probably on Google Books.
[01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:53.480]   They're writing the books.
[01:09:53.480 --> 01:10:14.400]   Yeah, that's a really cool book.
[01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:37.360]   That's a really cool book.
[01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:59.680]   Yeah, that's a really cool book.
[01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:06.680]   Go ahead and digitize.
[01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:13.680]   Google took issue with the criticism.
[01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:14.680]   The agreement.
[01:11:14.680 --> 01:11:15.680]   I'm thinking Google is the Eddie Haskell.
[01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:16.680]   Oh, no, that was Apple.
[01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:17.680]   You just did that.
[01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:20.520]   Is that the neck beard voice?
[01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:22.120]   The agreement is not exclusive.
[01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:24.120]   If unproofed by the court, it will be.
[01:11:24.120 --> 01:11:25.120]   It is Clinton.
[01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:26.120]   No, no.
[01:11:26.120 --> 01:11:28.800]   The agreement is not exclusive.
[01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:30.920]   If improved by the court, it will expand.
[01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:32.920]   I did not do that woman.
[01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:37.240]   It will expand access to millions of books in the United States.
[01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:38.920]   The book writes registry.
[01:11:38.920 --> 01:11:44.920]   The agreement stands to inject more competition into the digital book space.
[01:11:44.920 --> 01:11:46.600]   I like that word.
[01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:52.720]   So it's understandable why our competitors would fight hard to prevent more competition.
[01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:53.720]   Do you know, evil?
[01:11:53.720 --> 01:11:54.720]   I love the way they do.
[01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:55.720]   They twist it.
[01:11:55.720 --> 01:11:57.520]   This is all twisted.
[01:11:57.520 --> 01:11:59.800]   You need a, you need a, it's genius.
[01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:04.240]   You need a Bloomsday book to understand half of what these guys are saying.
[01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:07.240]   And why you professor James Grimelman.
[01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:11.240]   I am not making this up.
[01:12:11.240 --> 01:12:12.960]   I am not making this up.
[01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:17.120]   He runs the public index.org.
[01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:19.440]   Says Google is right.
[01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:22.720]   There are access benefits to making books available.
[01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:27.120]   A question of whether this is good or bad for competition is hotly contested.
[01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:32.960]   There are clear ways that the settlement could create a concentration of power, especially
[01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:34.040]   over orphaned books.
[01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:36.440]   It's only the orphan book thing that makes a difference, right?
[01:12:36.440 --> 01:12:40.360]   If Google's just saying, hey, anybody can digitize these, we think we'd like to.
[01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:43.160]   But if Microsoft wanted to, of course, Microsoft dropped its book.
[01:12:43.160 --> 01:12:45.520]   I know they released all the books to the public domain.
[01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:46.520]   It's good for them.
[01:12:46.520 --> 01:12:48.120]   That's what Google will not do, right?
[01:12:48.120 --> 01:12:49.120]   No.
[01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:51.520]   The proposed settlement was reached.
[01:12:51.520 --> 01:12:59.240]   If Google digitizes a public domain book, they stamped their little watermark every page.
[01:12:59.240 --> 01:13:00.240]   It's now a Google book.
[01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:01.240]   It's a Google book.
[01:13:01.240 --> 01:13:02.240]   It's bold.
[01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:03.680]   And by the way, it's not public domain.
[01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:04.680]   And that's the point.
[01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:05.680]   It's orphaned.
[01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:07.920]   No, but there are public domain books that go back to the 19th.
[01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:09.280]   That now become Google books.
[01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:10.280]   Yeah.
[01:13:10.280 --> 01:13:11.280]   And nobody else can do it?
[01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:12.280]   You can't.
[01:13:12.280 --> 01:13:16.600]   The way they have the license deal is that, I mean, if you have a copy of the book and
[01:13:16.600 --> 01:13:20.160]   you want to scan it in yourself, yeah, you can go out and reprint it if you wanted to.
[01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:23.320]   But if Google reprinted some book from the University of South Dakota.
[01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:25.080]   They now have the copy.
[01:13:25.080 --> 01:13:27.760]   They own the copyright to the digital version.
[01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:29.080]   Oh, that's a digital version.
[01:13:29.080 --> 01:13:30.080]   Yeah.
[01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:31.720]   There is digital version, not one you might do.
[01:13:31.720 --> 01:13:32.720]   Right.
[01:13:32.720 --> 01:13:34.680]   But they're the only ones who are going to spend any money doing this.
[01:13:34.680 --> 01:13:35.760]   If they do it, it's done.
[01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:36.760]   You could do it.
[01:13:36.760 --> 01:13:37.760]   I mean, you could take a book.
[01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:39.200]   It takes you about a few weeks.
[01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:44.760]   Part of the agreement, they're paying $125 million to create a book rights registry where
[01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:47.040]   authors and publishers can register their work.
[01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:50.480]   So you and I would run over to the books' rights registry and say we own these books.
[01:13:50.480 --> 01:13:51.480]   Right.
[01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:54.720]   And receive compensation from institutional subscriptions or book sales.
[01:13:54.720 --> 01:13:55.720]   So that'll be big bucks.
[01:13:55.720 --> 01:13:59.280]   Yeah, I get five, six bucks per book.
[01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:00.280]   Who knows?
[01:14:00.280 --> 01:14:02.800]   Well, you know, maybe you didn't, you know, you might not, one of the things I always do
[01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:06.520]   when I, and I always tell people to do so they do a book deal is that you got to get
[01:14:06.520 --> 01:14:08.200]   the rights back to the book.
[01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:09.200]   I know.
[01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:10.200]   You told me I should do that.
[01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:11.200]   I did not do that.
[01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:12.200]   They always sign off on it.
[01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:13.200]   Because they don't care.
[01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:15.120]   They don't know it's worthless after five years.
[01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:16.120]   You know, they don't care.
[01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:17.120]   They don't know it's a book that they don't know.
[01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:18.120]   They don't know it's a book that they don't know it's a book that they don't know it's
[01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:19.120]   a book that they don't know it's a book that they don't know it's a book that they don't

[01:15:33.120 --> 01:15:37.120]   a book that they don't know it's a book that they don't know it's a book that they don't
[01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:41.360]   know it's my rim shot I should have known as soon as you gave them the leading line
[01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:46.920]   I should have had it ready so no the dummy contract yeah that while he's dummy contract
[01:15:46.920 --> 01:15:51.480]   and they keep the book forever they bet you basically sold the book to them actually
[01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:58.080]   no I didn't know you could have done that throughout the show I didn't I didn't I didn't
[01:15:58.080 --> 01:16:03.360]   shine the dummy contract there oh I you were smart well I had a lot of things and there's
[01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:07.000]   a bunch of liability clauses that got to go on these book that you got to get rid of
[01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:11.720]   there's about 50 items that have to be pulled out of a typical book contract they always
[01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:16.440]   do it if you if you have the if you just say hey I don't want this okay as opposed to
[01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:20.960]   be just signed yeah they're very they negotiate that's what the this is there that's what I
[01:16:20.960 --> 01:16:24.560]   always hate about negotiations you negotiate with somebody who makes a living negotiating
[01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:30.120]   and I make a living being a genial fellow on the radio genial fellow and so you sign you
[01:16:30.120 --> 01:16:38.800]   would say okay sure whatever I'm gonna tell me I will saw the dummy goal all right no more
[01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:44.600]   no more you're too big now nobody's asked me to sign a contract in years you don't need
[01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:48.280]   one you're making more money than them put together you're making more money than wily
[01:16:48.280 --> 01:16:55.400]   probably am but that's not saying much I probably am yeah that's one publisher I wouldn't recommend
[01:16:55.400 --> 01:17:00.080]   let me just say that they actually none of them they're all the same pretty much a bad
[01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:04.880]   business these days it really is I think once you just publish a book and just get it on
[01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:09.120]   Kindle I mean if you're writing a textbook yeah you probably have each all the right
[01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:15.880]   people with a Kindle yeah unless they think you're probably right I don't know I mean
[01:17:15.880 --> 01:17:20.040]   that's the way I have the only get 30% of the of the money that the Kindle guys get the
[01:17:20.040 --> 01:17:27.440]   other 70 which is still actually not bad yeah which is better than 15% or 10 or maybe
[01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:37.800]   not teen or you pay I think it says that in the dummy contract or maybe nothing it's in
[01:17:37.800 --> 01:17:45.080]   there it's a clause 14.2 let's check into audible.com here real quickly see if there's
[01:17:45.080 --> 01:17:51.960]   any great audio books to purchase Kirk with all the travel you do I think you must have
[01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:57.760]   an audible.com account I do I do do you listen I do you know audible is the is the place to

[01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:08.960]   to thrillers or the serious stuff I've I've listened to snow crash and the what was the
[01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:13.360]   book about the divers shadow divers that was that was that I listened to that when I was
[01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:19.400]   on this tour of Brazil we were in the bus that bouncing down the dusty road me and my
[01:18:19.400 --> 01:18:24.280]   wife and I thought it's four hours to begin to the whatever we're going to some of those
[01:18:24.280 --> 01:18:30.320]   and that that but lately and I've been into a lot of an Iran stuff some listen to capitalism
[01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:34.560]   the I would think the unknown I ran fan John C. to war I don't want to even talk about
[01:18:34.560 --> 01:18:41.240]   an Iran so let's don't even you know you're not a fan of objectivism John you don't believe
[01:18:41.240 --> 01:18:45.640]   the way I was in college I had a roommate for a while who was an objectivism nut and he
[01:18:45.640 --> 01:18:50.000]   that was the end of it they're nice thick books that's the best part I'm just a capitalism
[01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:55.320]   nut not an objectivism nut I like the thickness frankly I buy them for the number of a lot
[01:18:55.320 --> 01:19:00.460]   of CEO types are big and ran of course they are because it's all about I'm technique
[01:19:00.460 --> 01:19:07.520]   tagger that I run the world shadow divers is a good one for if you've never read an audio
[01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:13.200]   book this is kind of like the greatest audio book for your first one because it's just
[01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:18.840]   it's gripping it's the true story of two guys who are these you know they're dry suit divers
[01:19:18.840 --> 01:19:24.440]   are deep sea divers not scuba deep sea divers your diver right now are you darlin I'm a
[01:19:24.440 --> 01:19:31.360]   I'm the air guy that's right you're up now down I go down whoa hit the drums where's
[01:19:31.360 --> 01:19:37.080]   my big where's my rim shot shadow divers to Americans who risked everything to solve one
[01:19:37.080 --> 01:19:41.720]   of the last mysteries of World War two they find a you boat that is not record a sunken
[01:19:41.720 --> 01:19:46.960]   you boat is not recorded anywhere no one knew that it sank it's very very deep so there
[01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:51.200]   I mean they're using these weird nitrogen mixes in their tags I mean they're doing weird
[01:19:51.200 --> 01:19:59.000]   stuff and it's a story of them finding the wreck figuring out whose wreck it is and ultimately
[01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:08.080]   going to meet the families of the German soldiers German naval see the seamen who went down oh
[01:20:08.080 --> 01:20:13.240]   let me play this story for you book is rooted in hundreds of hours of interviews with
[01:20:13.240 --> 01:20:17.080]   chatterton and Kohler was countless more I will see I hate it when they do this and
[01:20:17.080 --> 01:20:21.360]   I makes me mad they put the forward on there and other witnesses to the events you know
[01:20:21.360 --> 01:20:24.240]   I don't want to hear the foreword this Michael Pritchard reading and he does a great job with
[01:20:24.240 --> 01:20:28.920]   it I'll tell you what you get this Richard not the comedian no it always confused me
[01:20:28.920 --> 01:20:33.360]   because Michael Pritchard without a tea does a lot of audiobooks but it's not the same
[01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:37.200]   as Michael Pritchard who also does audiobooks but he works with kids and so he's great
[01:20:37.200 --> 01:20:42.600]   you remember Michael he's a great guy he's a great guy yeah yeah I like him probably a
[01:20:42.600 --> 01:20:47.040]   friend of Marty Higgins and he could write some material for me you probably could there's
[01:20:47.040 --> 01:20:51.200]   a bunch of guys in the bear he does a lot of speaking and Bob Sarlot does a lot of the
[01:20:51.200 --> 01:20:53.560]   speaking you know what they do when they do the corporate stuff you probably do Sarlot's
[01:20:53.560 --> 01:20:58.880]   material I could easily because I get the same get the same labs right I get as far as
[01:20:58.880 --> 01:21:03.840]   he got with it no they do a lot of corporates and he affects Sarlot told me the key with
[01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:09.320]   corporates is you throw in three jokes that include the CEO and you know you know you
[01:21:09.320 --> 01:21:13.760]   throw in the jokes from the company they all they love that so much I don't know how I
[01:21:13.760 --> 01:21:17.560]   got it on that track shadow divers to Americans who risk everything so here's how you get it

[01:21:42.120 --> 01:21:47.120]   that certainly if you've never listened audio books make the first one shadow divers but
[01:21:47.120 --> 01:21:52.200]   we have a if you just go to audible.com you'll see a lot of other wonderful choices that's
[01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:56.240]   in ran get in the and ran by the way that that shadow divers that's a six hour book that's
[01:21:56.240 --> 01:22:02.320]   how long it takes to go to shit so needs a and back I don't know where it is shit to
[01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:07.680]   need I don't want to go there I think it's a sheets and it's a yeah it's in Mexico yeah
[01:22:07.680 --> 01:22:11.200]   oh it's in oh no no that was in that was the can coon trip that's right that's right let
[01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:15.280]   me tell you if you get Atlas shrug and it's a yeah if you get at least you get a six hour
[01:22:15.280 --> 01:22:21.840]   trip in the in a from a can coon to sheets and it's a and then back yeah I said what's
[01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:26.160]   in shit needs to know that's where the ruins are the yeah the shoots and needs a ruins yeah
[01:22:26.160 --> 01:22:30.600]   I don't think he's saying it right maybe I'm not she needs to I don't know I'll look at
[01:22:30.600 --> 01:22:36.200]   put down chicken eats chicken eats is how it's spelled where would you go then if you were
[01:22:36.200 --> 01:22:42.600]   reading Atlas shrugged because Atlas shrugged my friends is 63 hours you could go to Mars
[01:22:42.600 --> 01:22:47.720]   56 50 yeah you had the unabridged version there's an abridged version which is what
[01:22:47.720 --> 01:22:52.520]   I'll listen no no listen to the unabridged all day all day all day 60 minute to get a
[01:22:52.520 --> 01:22:56.880]   see what this is Scott brick one of the best narrators long well maybe you'd like maybe
[01:22:56.880 --> 01:23:01.880]   you'd prefer something lighter like the fountainhead I read the fountain that's only 32 hours
[01:23:01.880 --> 01:23:06.000]   yeah I read the phone hit I actually read the phone hit in one seating these are the things
[01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:10.840]   you read I read it and call you what yeah you didn't I did to how did you read in one
[01:23:10.840 --> 01:23:15.680]   started reading it I finished it like a day later you didn't move for a day no I just read
[01:23:15.680 --> 01:23:19.640]   the whole book I just oh my god oh come on really sorry I got so the only time I've ever
[01:23:19.640 --> 01:23:23.720]   done that with any book ever it's pretty and grat and grossing yeah so I figured I might
[01:23:23.720 --> 01:23:28.560]   as well read the whole thing and just get it over with you can shoot myself over with
[01:23:28.560 --> 01:23:34.400]   I'm going okay okay so you get you get two books you could have and if you want more for
[01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:40.320]   your money I would go with the Atlas shrug because it's 65 hours I buy my books by the
[01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:46.460]   pound they should pay you to read them let's listen I might see if there's any dangit
[01:23:46.460 --> 01:23:52.880]   tab it a little bit to listen wisdom within man's soul it showed the nature and function
[01:23:52.880 --> 01:23:57.920]   of the creator and the second hand audible dot com slash twit to you get to choose two
[01:23:57.920 --> 01:24:01.400]   books of your choice for free you get to keep me if you don't stick around but I know you
[01:24:01.400 --> 01:24:04.800]   will because it's really a great way to spend time if you're in an airplane in a car if
[01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:12.480]   you're going to chicken eats a if you're going to change the line one that chicken eats anywhere
[01:24:12.480 --> 01:24:19.760]   Mexican chicken yeah chicken eats it in Russia chicken eats you audible dot com slash
[01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:25.880]   twit to think of so much of their support of this week in tech it is a for this is a
[01:24:25.880 --> 01:24:29.760]   this is a good group I think we should just convene this again you know my dream is we're
[01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:34.320]   gonna be so he's never here it's amazing that he's even in the country I got Skype but you
[01:24:34.320 --> 01:24:38.880]   know he's got Skype that's a blatant invitation he's got I've got Skype and I'm not afraid
[01:24:38.880 --> 01:24:43.400]   he's we're gonna move the studio eventually out in the big room there well no you're gonna
[01:24:43.400 --> 01:24:47.280]   like it because I'm gonna have a big round table can you have like the same setup two
[01:24:47.280 --> 01:24:53.400]   weeks in a row is that possible I'm like a shark if I'm not moving I died there's this
[01:24:53.400 --> 01:24:59.280]   but people out there don't realize it but the studio of Leo's if you come here week after
[01:24:59.280 --> 01:25:03.480]   week after week different every week they get the cameras move the lights different they
[01:25:03.480 --> 01:25:07.600]   got different things hanging from the ceiling and now it's got a whole new board and a big
[01:25:07.600 --> 01:25:11.840]   computer sitting behind me it's ridiculous it's almost like there's something there's
[01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:16.160]   something wrong with you there's stuff well there's no no question about that we know
[01:25:16.160 --> 01:25:21.560]   that it's just never good enough he just wants it still I mean he's just then tinkering
[01:25:21.560 --> 01:25:26.240]   that's like you're retired it's just my retirement some people go out in the garage and make
[01:25:26.240 --> 01:25:32.080]   you know bookshelves I make studios so you're gonna move into the big room we're thinking
[01:25:32.080 --> 01:25:35.800]   about what's gonna be in here this is such a cozy little room keep this but I want to
[01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:41.040]   have a second studio there I can see what I want to do you be studio be and you know why poker
[01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:48.360]   I won't go I want to have liquor in the front poker in the back like I want to have poker
[01:25:48.360 --> 01:25:55.480]   in the back ladies I want to have this is my dream you know like like I want to have you
[01:25:55.480 --> 01:26:01.280]   and a bunch of tech guys playing poker like a poker TV show but talking tech while they
[01:26:01.280 --> 01:26:06.040]   play poker wouldn't that be good yeah I guess that's actually a good idea I'm to sign me
[01:26:06.040 --> 01:26:11.480]   up yeah are you a poker player home I am I think Calla Canis is pretty good we may not
[01:26:11.480 --> 01:26:17.960]   let him play with us yeah you know we can only have two blow hearts at a time yep he can't
[01:26:17.960 --> 01:26:26.360]   have John yeah Calla can be you wouldn't be able to fit the three of us in a room yeah
[01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:30.560]   it's just too many you go in one place I'll I'll see your iPhone and raise you 200 Twitter
[01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:34.880]   friends I think exactly I think we have a lot of fun anyway that's that's basically
[01:26:34.880 --> 01:26:40.120]   what Twitter is minus the poker if we just added the poker we'd really have a good show
[01:26:40.120 --> 01:26:45.040]   that's what I'm thinking okay all right I'm gonna I'm gonna close this up unless anybody
[01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:48.560]   has any other big stories that we want to talk to him way wrote by where he wrote the
[01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:57.000]   scathing piece oh I forgot Vivek Kundra yeah all right so John writes a blog post about
[01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:04.680]   our national CIO yeah the man in charge of investment for the nation's infrastructure
[01:27:04.680 --> 01:27:09.160]   and says the guys at doofus first of all you say you said he inflated his yeah you said
[01:27:09.160 --> 01:27:14.960]   he inflated his resume a little bit and but but the greater deeper implication is not so
[01:27:14.960 --> 01:27:19.780]   much that but that's that he knows nothing about tech and that he snowed everybody in
[01:27:19.780 --> 01:27:23.840]   Silicon Valley because he came out here in Timo Riley and everybody's going crazy this
[01:27:23.840 --> 01:27:30.560]   guy's a genius we love this guy tech whiz tech whiz was the name so Om picks this up
[01:27:30.560 --> 01:27:36.840]   and now Om you said that we got it wrong last week so so correct me so this is what I wanted
[01:27:36.840 --> 01:27:43.640]   to just point out just to set the record straight I just called the White House to get a comment
[01:27:43.640 --> 01:27:51.800]   on what was John's story just like any good reporter should and oh no no no and they said
[01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:57.080]   that it is not true it's a lie etc etc and like every good reporter in the national media
[01:27:57.080 --> 01:28:01.400]   you said well the White House said it's so it's cool must be true no I said just the
[01:28:01.400 --> 01:28:06.720]   portion which was not true I wrote that portion and I said okay this is what the White House
[01:28:06.720 --> 01:28:13.760]   said and my post is exactly that what should I it just states the facts it doesn't take
[01:28:13.760 --> 01:28:20.960]   any other issue with John's post it is just a poet my reporting that's all well let's say
[01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:24.840]   what you would such a mention that what any good reporter would do wouldn't most good reporters
[01:28:24.840 --> 01:28:30.120]   get a comment from the person being targeted by an article since somebody had and get my
[01:28:30.120 --> 01:28:34.320]   email you got my email you got my Twitter account you got my so you asked Kunder for
[01:28:34.320 --> 01:28:38.520]   a comment and you got I sent my I went through channels I got nothing but I'm saying why
[01:28:38.520 --> 01:28:44.880]   didn't old contact me because I was a very old there I was asking them to comment in
[01:28:44.880 --> 01:28:48.520]   your story well then you went on and on but you could have called me and at least gotten
[01:28:48.520 --> 01:28:52.360]   a I didn't see this is the difference I would go all the others would have said did you
[01:28:52.360 --> 01:28:57.360]   know I did work for a comment go on I didn't go on and on about the story I just said this
[01:28:57.360 --> 01:29:02.360]   is what the door I grew up and this is what Kundra and his people said and that's the
[01:29:02.360 --> 01:29:07.300]   end of it that's the end of the hit piece really came from O'Reilly more than the home
[01:29:07.300 --> 01:29:13.880]   well why they just basically went went add hominem on me and said I was a a loser for
[01:29:13.880 --> 01:29:17.800]   making that tape with Weiner but anyway I that said I didn't think it was that bad I
[01:29:17.800 --> 01:29:22.000]   just thought it was funny no I just want to make sure that you know the record is straight
[01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:25.400]   yeah I like to know why you still haven't gone out to lunch with me like you promised
[01:29:25.400 --> 01:29:30.360]   like six months ago we have a recording here I want you to listen to Kunder here my favorite
[01:29:30.360 --> 01:29:36.920]   part of Kunder is little his his little speech at the broadband hearings of the FCC where
[01:29:36.920 --> 01:29:41.120]   it's just like people should just listen to this let you will let our audience be the
[01:29:41.120 --> 01:29:47.760]   judge they can just listen to this and this is this is Vivek Kundra the CIO of the US
[01:29:47.760 --> 01:29:52.800]   and if I can add to that you know I think one of the the biggest problems we see right
[01:29:52.800 --> 01:29:59.400]   now is the fact that so much of what we do online actually requires training and I think
[01:29:59.400 --> 01:30:04.480]   where you're going to see the greatest innovation in the coming decade is going to be around
[01:30:04.480 --> 01:30:11.280]   that human computer interface and think about this another people on second life right now
[01:30:11.280 --> 01:30:17.200]   but imagine a universe where you have the Star Trek holodeck where you could literally
[01:30:17.200 --> 01:30:23.960]   ask the computer to ask questions and get answers in the same way if you look at some
[01:30:23.960 --> 01:30:31.360]   of these software companies they made it so complicated to interact with their technologies
[01:30:31.360 --> 01:30:38.200]   and at the same time the underlying architecture and the platforms he's just a question he's
[01:30:38.200 --> 01:30:44.480]   riffing here he's riffing it's better because a lot of it was built and architected around
[01:30:44.480 --> 01:30:50.360]   bandwidth constraints therefore you had to deploy technologies that were much more complicated
[01:30:50.360 --> 01:30:57.760]   in terms of interacting and communicating now as broadband deployment and more importantly
[01:30:57.760 --> 01:31:05.240]   if you look at the megabits per second how much how much information can we get through
[01:31:05.240 --> 01:31:10.720]   the pipeline is going to be so important and as new and new software technologies are being
[01:31:10.720 --> 01:31:16.080]   introduced but you're going to see a huge change from how applications are architected
[01:31:16.080 --> 01:31:21.560]   with skip logic to video and much more human ways of interacting with these applications
[01:31:21.560 --> 01:31:26.960]   rather than binary or cobalt ways of interacting with those applications.
[01:31:26.960 --> 01:31:39.960]   What is cobalt?
[01:31:39.960 --> 01:31:44.960]   Well Adam Curry actually figured it out.
[01:31:44.960 --> 01:31:46.880]   Well it turns out that Vivek was once a worked in a boiler room and skip logic is the term
[01:31:46.880 --> 01:31:51.400]   based on the script that they give you and there's logical answers and you skip around
[01:31:51.400 --> 01:31:55.160]   you go to somebody says no so you skip to part three.
[01:31:55.160 --> 01:31:57.360]   Yeah that's what it says conditional branching.
[01:31:57.360 --> 01:31:58.360]   Yeah.
[01:31:58.360 --> 01:32:01.680]   Allows you to change of course your respondents take through a survey.
[01:32:01.680 --> 01:32:03.160]   What does that have to do with cobalt?
[01:32:03.160 --> 01:32:04.160]   Nothing.
[01:32:04.160 --> 01:32:09.400]   It did sound, there was a Palinesque feeling to that answer I have to say.
[01:32:09.400 --> 01:32:13.080]   I think if we transcribed it.
[01:32:13.080 --> 01:32:16.240]   Somebody did and it still makes no sense.
[01:32:16.240 --> 01:32:19.400]   No I maybe he was nervous.
[01:32:19.400 --> 01:32:23.760]   Well I'll tell you this I give him some advice if he's going to do any of this kind of speak
[01:32:23.760 --> 01:32:27.840]   don't go to these things where you have to actually have to con converse just write a
[01:32:27.840 --> 01:32:28.840]   statement.
[01:32:28.840 --> 01:32:29.840]   Write a statement.
[01:32:29.840 --> 01:32:32.280]   Read a speech that somebody else wrote.
[01:32:32.280 --> 01:32:39.640]   Well do you think I mean all of the back and forth about the White House comment don't
[01:32:39.640 --> 01:32:43.200]   you think there was a little bit of merit to what John said?
[01:32:43.200 --> 01:32:44.960]   Sure.
[01:32:44.960 --> 01:32:46.760]   I mean listen to that quote.
[01:32:46.760 --> 01:32:47.760]   Yeah.
[01:32:47.760 --> 01:32:50.520]   I'm not knocked over.
[01:32:50.520 --> 01:32:54.800]   I don't judge people you know that you know so you're good man.
[01:32:54.800 --> 01:32:55.800]   That's what we like.
[01:32:55.800 --> 01:32:56.800]   You're a good man.
[01:32:56.800 --> 01:32:57.800]   I'll make up for it.
[01:32:57.800 --> 01:32:59.240]   John does nothing but judge people.
[01:32:59.240 --> 01:33:01.240]   That's kind of what you had paid it.
[01:33:01.240 --> 01:33:02.960]   I'll just I'll eject that there.
[01:33:02.960 --> 01:33:08.520]   So I just was saying that you know John reported something I just called a couple of people
[01:33:08.520 --> 01:33:13.000]   just to make sure he said you know what he said and that's the end of story I'm not
[01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:16.200]   taking positions on one way or the other.
[01:33:16.200 --> 01:33:20.320]   That's not you know I don't really know enough about.
[01:33:20.320 --> 01:33:22.720]   Did you meet with coondra when he was out here?
[01:33:22.720 --> 01:33:23.720]   No.
[01:33:23.720 --> 01:33:24.720]   No.
[01:33:24.720 --> 01:33:29.720]   I had to say that statement that you just played and I know you played it on no agenda
[01:33:29.720 --> 01:33:31.320]   as well and I heard it there.
[01:33:31.320 --> 01:33:32.320]   Makes no sense.
[01:33:32.320 --> 01:33:33.320]   No.
[01:33:33.320 --> 01:33:35.400]   And he's in he's testifying in front Congress here.
[01:33:35.400 --> 01:33:40.800]   Well actually a subcommittee it's actually an FCC that's FCC and then the rest of the
[01:33:40.800 --> 01:33:45.000]   people that were there believe me weren't not any brighter.
[01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:48.240]   It is possible to baffle him with BS in this world.
[01:33:48.240 --> 01:33:50.520]   Not if you're good dice not if people are dissecting.
[01:33:50.520 --> 01:33:55.160]   Not if people and I think this is our job your job is to sit down and say well what did
[01:33:55.160 --> 01:33:56.720]   he say?
[01:33:56.720 --> 01:34:00.800]   What did he really say and what the hell is skip logic and co-ball have to do with anything.
[01:34:00.800 --> 01:34:01.800]   You know I've been reminded.
[01:34:01.800 --> 01:34:05.840]   The whole deck you know the guy who was the most famous for like just you don't even
[01:34:05.840 --> 01:34:09.400]   have to leave your house to do reporting it was I F stone.
[01:34:09.400 --> 01:34:10.400]   Yeah.
[01:34:10.400 --> 01:34:13.560]   Who used to just essentially take what was available that somebody put in front of you
[01:34:13.560 --> 01:34:16.720]   know in front of you know he was great he was the best and you just read it and say
[01:34:16.720 --> 01:34:20.480]   hey did anybody notice that he said here and that's all you know it's not that's all
[01:34:20.480 --> 01:34:24.760]   I was doing that that was the commentary that got me triggered to write that piece because
[01:34:24.760 --> 01:34:31.840]   I was just like why is this guy is his job that important as CIA well it depends on who
[01:34:31.840 --> 01:34:33.480]   you ask.
[01:34:33.480 --> 01:34:39.960]   He controls the post money oversight okay on on spending in the tech sector.
[01:34:39.960 --> 01:34:44.200]   You know to be honest this is a continuation of a non stop story of government not really
[01:34:44.200 --> 01:34:48.600]   being very sophisticated when it comes to technology and people who are interested in
[01:34:48.600 --> 01:34:51.960]   technology looking at what government does saying these guys don't get it.
[01:34:51.960 --> 01:34:52.960]   I mean.
[01:34:52.960 --> 01:34:55.520]   You should have been the CIO you've had your chance but you'd be taking a cut.
[01:34:55.520 --> 01:34:59.320]   I'd be saying the exact same thing he just said you know to hold a deck once we get a
[01:34:59.320 --> 01:35:01.320]   whole a deck it's all going to be different.
[01:35:01.320 --> 01:35:04.880]   Somebody in the chat room said this is exactly what exactly sounds like the way Leo says
[01:35:04.880 --> 01:35:09.880]   at the beginning of every radio show that speak it's true but I'm on the I'm just telling
[01:35:09.880 --> 01:35:12.920]   stories on the radio there's a difference between that and spending the story for the
[01:35:12.920 --> 01:35:13.920]   FCC.
[01:35:13.920 --> 01:35:19.400]   I have stone rocks as this guy on the chat room a lash maliciously maligned and recently
[01:35:19.400 --> 01:35:21.880]   in Leo's precious New Yorker.
[01:35:21.880 --> 01:35:23.840]   You own your precious.
[01:35:23.840 --> 01:35:24.840]   You own it.
[01:35:24.840 --> 01:35:26.080]   My precious New Yorker.
[01:35:26.080 --> 01:35:28.040]   My precious New Yorker.
[01:35:28.040 --> 01:35:31.120]   I wonder how he knows that I think of the New Yorker's precious.
[01:35:31.120 --> 01:35:34.360]   I do love the New Yorker he just thinks I'm a typical East Coast liberal I must love the
[01:35:34.360 --> 01:35:35.360]   New Yorker.
[01:35:35.360 --> 01:35:37.080]   Have you ever been to the East Coast?
[01:35:37.080 --> 01:35:42.280]   Hey you know I'm glad we could kiss and make up home you're great I'm glad we got you
[01:35:42.280 --> 01:35:46.560]   on the show please come back and join us.
[01:35:46.560 --> 01:35:47.560]   He's got nothing to say.
[01:35:47.560 --> 01:35:48.560]   I caught him out.
[01:35:48.560 --> 01:35:49.560]   Did I turn him off?
[01:35:49.560 --> 01:35:50.560]   Is he still there?
[01:35:50.560 --> 01:35:51.560]   Did you mute yourself?
[01:35:51.560 --> 01:35:52.560]   I don't know.
[01:35:52.560 --> 01:35:53.560]   Oh there you go there you go.
[01:35:53.560 --> 01:35:57.480]   I'm in a word I'm in a word I said for the last half hour.
[01:35:57.480 --> 01:35:59.480]   No I'm just kidding.
[01:35:59.480 --> 01:36:00.480]   No no no no.
[01:36:00.480 --> 01:36:07.480]   GigaOM.com is the place to go a great series of blogs and I'm reading them all.
[01:36:07.480 --> 01:36:10.440]   I think you've done a yeah I think you've really done a good job and I'm not.
[01:36:10.440 --> 01:36:12.800]   Are you going to give Leo some subscription to the good one?
[01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:13.880]   No I don't want to.
[01:36:13.880 --> 01:36:16.760]   Sure I don't need the verticals I like the main space.
[01:36:16.760 --> 01:36:17.920]   I think you should check them out once in a while.
[01:36:17.920 --> 01:36:18.920]   It's on my book Mark now GigaOM.
[01:36:18.920 --> 01:36:21.680]   No it's really good yeah.
[01:36:21.680 --> 01:36:23.640]   Thank you Leo for having me on the show.
[01:36:23.640 --> 01:36:26.560]   So you never say anything bad about anybody?
[01:36:26.560 --> 01:36:31.120]   Sometimes I do except you know I try not to because you know that kind of thing catches
[01:36:31.120 --> 01:36:32.760]   up to you as a bad mojo.
[01:36:32.760 --> 01:36:33.760]   Yeah karma.
[01:36:33.760 --> 01:36:36.560]   Yeah well good you can come back then.
[01:36:36.560 --> 01:36:38.560]   Absolute John you're out of here.
[01:36:38.560 --> 01:36:44.680]   John's a good man.
[01:36:44.680 --> 01:36:49.560]   John is John's my hero without John C. Dvorak I would be sitting interviewing chicken soup
[01:36:49.560 --> 01:36:55.040]   for the teenage spirit or something like that without you sir without you my friend.
[01:36:55.040 --> 01:36:56.040]   Those days are all you've passed.
[01:36:56.040 --> 01:36:57.040]   You passed me.
[01:36:57.040 --> 01:36:59.480]   I'm now old I'm the guy who sits on a ball.
[01:36:59.480 --> 01:37:03.840]   You always had actually more tech chops than just about anybody else based on what you
[01:37:03.840 --> 01:37:05.640]   actually do.
[01:37:05.640 --> 01:37:06.640]   Well that's what I love about this.
[01:37:06.640 --> 01:37:10.200]   I'm always breaking crap.
[01:37:10.200 --> 01:37:12.000]   I just tweeted that.
[01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:17.680]   Yes you know I wish I was as calm and you know comfortable and engaged as you are with
[01:37:17.680 --> 01:37:18.960]   your with your gas.
[01:37:18.960 --> 01:37:19.960]   Thank you.
[01:37:19.960 --> 01:37:20.960]   We have a great time.
[01:37:20.960 --> 01:37:21.960]   It is fun.
[01:37:21.960 --> 01:37:22.960]   I hope to make it fun.
[01:37:22.960 --> 01:37:24.200]   Fun for you and fun for the audience.
[01:37:24.200 --> 01:37:26.600]   I really glad Kirk Harnack is here.
[01:37:26.600 --> 01:37:28.760]   My bankers having a good time.
[01:37:28.760 --> 01:37:31.280]   You know he's just stays up nights counting the money.
[01:37:31.280 --> 01:37:33.440]   It's such a tough job.
[01:37:33.440 --> 01:37:34.440]   Kirk Harnack is here.
[01:37:34.440 --> 01:37:35.440]   Don't tell Kirk that.
[01:37:35.440 --> 01:37:38.400]   He gave me a $30,000 sound system.
[01:37:38.400 --> 01:37:39.880]   Kirk I can't thank you.
[01:37:39.880 --> 01:37:43.720]   I loaned it's a loan it's not a gift for gift I'd have to pay taxes.
[01:37:43.720 --> 01:37:46.080]   It's amazing the Axia sound system.
[01:37:46.080 --> 01:37:49.880]   I hope folks that you can hear the difference in everything from now on but I know you're
[01:37:49.880 --> 01:37:50.880]   going to hear it.
[01:37:50.880 --> 01:37:51.880]   You've heard it in this show already.
[01:37:51.880 --> 01:37:52.880]   It just sounds great.
[01:37:52.880 --> 01:37:57.880]   And if we find out we don't have the copyrights we'll suck it out of your Kindle.
[01:37:57.880 --> 01:38:01.960]   Kirk where can we find more of you?
[01:38:01.960 --> 01:38:07.600]   I've got a really bad website that's 10 years old at Harnack.com but I really think you
[01:38:07.600 --> 01:38:09.600]   should call it Harnack the Magnificent.
[01:38:09.600 --> 01:38:10.600]   I really do.
[01:38:10.600 --> 01:38:11.760]   I think you guys are a bet there.
[01:38:11.760 --> 01:38:17.640]   Eventually I'll have a podcast called This Week in Radio Tech at This Week in Radio
[01:38:17.640 --> 01:38:18.640]   Tech.
[01:38:18.640 --> 01:38:19.640]   It better be part of Twitter.
[01:38:19.640 --> 01:38:22.440]   Well we'll talk about that over and over.
[01:38:22.440 --> 01:38:26.680]   Yeah because you guys were in here talking during the install and we got a huge audience
[01:38:26.680 --> 01:38:29.800]   watching Kirk and Colleen work on this and talking and chatting.
[01:38:29.800 --> 01:38:32.080]   Well my wife would be interested in this.
[01:38:32.080 --> 01:38:33.080]   It's interesting.
[01:38:33.080 --> 01:38:36.120]   My wife would be much more happier if you had the cameras in your studio than in a
[01:38:36.120 --> 01:38:37.120]   live studio.
[01:38:37.120 --> 01:38:38.560]   Okay so we should talk about that.
[01:38:38.560 --> 01:38:41.360]   That's why I'm not working out of my house.
[01:38:41.360 --> 01:38:43.120]   John C. Devorek is at Channel Devorek.
[01:38:43.120 --> 01:38:46.080]   Of course a million different podcasts now.
[01:38:46.080 --> 01:38:49.360]   You're the guy who hated podcasting who suddenly discovered podcasting and you did
[01:38:49.360 --> 01:38:50.360]   podcasting.
[01:38:50.360 --> 01:38:51.360]   You did.
[01:38:51.360 --> 01:38:53.120]   I am sure I have a column somewhere where you said we'll never go anywhere.
[01:38:53.120 --> 01:38:56.120]   You did the check on this show.
[01:38:56.120 --> 01:38:58.120]   You said everything that says it'll never go anywhere.
[01:38:58.120 --> 01:39:00.120]   You can't miss on that.
[01:39:00.120 --> 01:39:03.960]   John in your life have you ever said that you love something?
[01:39:03.960 --> 01:39:05.400]   Oh all the time.
[01:39:05.400 --> 01:39:06.400]   It's usually a wine.
[01:39:06.400 --> 01:39:07.400]   Or a meat.
[01:39:07.400 --> 01:39:08.400]   There's a lot of good wine.
[01:39:08.400 --> 01:39:09.400]   Yeah that's true.
[01:39:09.400 --> 01:39:10.400]   Not you mentioned it.
[01:39:10.400 --> 01:39:13.360]   No there's a lot of technology I like and I say it right off.
[01:39:13.360 --> 01:39:18.320]   I just have to skeptical about most things and the fact is 99% of this stuff is garbage.
[01:39:18.320 --> 01:39:19.600]   So it's like an easy you know.
[01:39:19.600 --> 01:39:20.600]   It's a safe bet.
[01:39:20.600 --> 01:39:21.600]   Safe bet.
[01:39:21.600 --> 01:39:23.520]   The default response.
[01:39:23.520 --> 01:39:25.800]   His skip logic is it's crap.
[01:39:25.800 --> 01:39:26.800]   It's crap.
[01:39:26.800 --> 01:39:27.800]   It's crap.
[01:39:27.800 --> 01:39:33.400]   Channeldevorac.com is the place to go for all of that.
