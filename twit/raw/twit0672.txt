[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   It's time for Twit this week in Tech. Great panel for you to vendor Harderwar from Engadget,
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.580]   Micah Sargent from Mobile Nations, Ben Brock Johnson from WBUR and man is there a lot to
[00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:14.720]   talk about. Two very important Supreme Court decisions that could change everything. A
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:20.500]   guy named Vermin Supremes, running for president, offering you a pony. I'm not sure why that
[00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:26.120]   got in the show, but it did. And why you shouldn't really worry about that iPhone brute force attack.

[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.600]   journalists like the beautiful Micah Sargent from iMourne.
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.600]   He's a senior at your explanations.
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.600]   And he's a good-looking fella.
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.600]   Hey Micah.
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:18.600]   Oh, that's so sweet.
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:19.600]   Thank you Leo.
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:20.600]   I'm excited to be here.
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:21.600]   Of course.
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.600]   Ready to kick things off.
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.600]   Don't get too excited.
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.600]   You're only attractive because you're young.
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:26.600]   Oh, great.
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.600]   That's the truth.
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:29.600]   I'm sorry.
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.600]   I've learned in all fades with age.
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.600]   No, it's great to have a hot stay young forever.
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.600]   You're an attractive person in many ways, not just your looks.
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.600]   Actually, we have a surprisingly good-looking bunch today.
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.600]   David R. DeWars is also here.
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.600]   He's a senior at Engadget.
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.600]   And I love that shirt, Devendra.
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:49.600]   Oh, thank you.
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:50.600]   Awesome.
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:51.600]   I love it.
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.600]   It's great for video.
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:53.600]   I try to wear it as often as possible.
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:54.600]   You're in New York.
[00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:55.600]   Where are you?
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:56.600]   I can't remember.
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:57.600]   Yeah, I'm in Brooklyn.
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:58.600]   Is it hot in Brooklyn today?
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:59.600]   It is.
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:00.600]   It's all right.
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.600]   I just came from Georgia actually.
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.600]   Just flew back in yesterday and that is hot.
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.600]   That is like 90 to 95 every day.
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.600]   It's pretty cool here right now.
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.600]   That might explain why there's about 15 people here from Georgia.
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:11.600]   Oh, yeah.
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.600]   Nobody wants to be in Georgia in the summer.
[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.600]   There's a good news TV network, GNTV.
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:17.600]   They're all here.
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.600]   There's many of them are interns, but they're people who do broadcast.
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:25.600]   They help various church organizations do broadcasts.
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.600]   They're here to figure out how the hell we do it.
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:28.600]   Right?
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.600]   No, you know better.
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:36.600]   There's also a guy who runs the network for the Metro North Railway.
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.600]   So if the trains are on time, you can thank Sergey.
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:46.600]   Also with us Ben Brock Johnson, senior producer of the BUR.
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:47.600]   Hey, Ben.
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:48.600]   How are you?
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:49.600]   I'm great.
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:50.600]   They stuck you in the attic.
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.600]   It looks like today.
[00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.600]   That's where I like to be.
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.600]   I keep it.
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.600]   I keep it cool in the attic.
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:59.600]   Oh, but wait a minute.
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:00.600]   David, it's nice to meet you.
[00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:01.600]   Oh, you haven't met?
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.600]   Well, no, we've talked before.
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:04.600]   We've never.
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.600]   Yeah, we've talked before, but I've never seen you in person.
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.600]   So it's nice to meet you.
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:09.600]   It's weird.
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.600]   It's worth virtually meeting, even though we're in the same city.
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:13.600]   So very strange.
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:14.600]   That's right.
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:15.600]   Nice to meet both of you.
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.600]   Yeah, I got Ben, Ben, Devindra, Devindra, Vindra, Vindra.
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.600]   So, Mike, it gets worse.
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.600]   They all have podcasts and all, you know, they do.
[00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.600]   But see, this is the one advantage.
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.600]   We're one of the few podcast networks that does video for reasons
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.600]   no one really gets because most of our people listen on the internet.
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.600]   But this is the advantage.
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:35.600]   So you could see each other like you.
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.600]   So first time seeing each other.
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.600]   A couple of big Supreme Court decisions this week.
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.600]   We were before the show.
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.600]   Carsten, my producer, and I were debating which is the bigger of the two.
[00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.600]   I think they're both important.
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:54.600]   Mobile phone privacy rights were bolstered by a five-four decision.
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:03.600]   Chief Justice Roberts was the swing on this one saying that law enforcement needs a warrant
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.600]   to get your location records.
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:11.600]   All this time, all of the major telcos in the United States, the wireless carriers,
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:19.600]   have had special website portals for law enforcement that any law enforcement, local police,
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.600]   the dog catcher can go to.
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.600]   And for like a buck-50, it wasn't expensive.
[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.600]   Could say where was Devindra on the night of May 22, 2012?
[00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.600]   And they'll have it.
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:35.600]   The case was kind of an interesting one.
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:42.600]   A fellow named Timothy Ivory Carpenter was accused of robbing a series of radio shacks.
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.600]   That in itself is interesting.
[00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:49.600]   But it was probably could have just waited until they went bankrupt.
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:53.600]   But anyway, he was armed robbery was accused of.
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:59.600]   And the only evidence they had was law enforcement got 127 days of his cell phone records.
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:03.600]   And was able to match up his location with the time of the robberies.
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:07.600]   He was near those locations each and every time in that kind of a conviction.
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:11.600]   His conviction has not been overturned, but it's been sent back to the lower court.
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:19.600]   And Justice Roberts was kind of at pains to call the ruling a narrow one saying, quote,
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.600]   it focused on the unique nature of cell phone location information.
[00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:27.600]   And in particular, they were bugged at the length of time.
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:33.600]   Mapping a cell phone's location, he wrote, this is in his decision, over the course of 127 days,
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:37.600]   provides an all encompassing record of the holders whereabouts.
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:42.600]   So I think that's the key that it's not like, well, was he there during that event?
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:43.600]   Was he there during that event?
[00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.600]   But it's everywhere he was.
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:52.600]   Roberts wrote as with GPS information, the timestamp data provides an intimate window into a person's life
[00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:57.600]   revealing not only his particular movements, but through them his familial, political, professional,
[00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:00.600]   religious and sexual associations.
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:01.600]   Wow.
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:07.600]   Kennedy, Thomas, Alito and Gorsuch dissented.
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:12.600]   But so it was a narrow victory of five, four victory on kind of, you know, the Chief Justice,
[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:16.600]   it was the swing in this one.
[00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:18.600]   Good news?
[00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:19.600]   I think it's mixed news.
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:20.600]   Mixed news.
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:21.600]   That's interesting.
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:24.600]   Yeah, I do this Vox piece.
[00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:26.600]   There's some stuff to agree with there.
[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:31.600]   So it taught, I mean, we've all seen or maybe have seen those law shows where, you know,
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:35.600]   it suddenly cuts to this dramatic scene and the person's like, oh, yeah, judge blah, blah,
[00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:36.600]   blah, blah, it owes me a favor.
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.600]   So I can go get that warrant right quick.
[00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:45.600]   And I think that, you know, it's noted that it doesn't have to just be federal judges who can get these,
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:46.600]   who can issue these warrants.
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:48.600]   It goes all the way down the line.
[00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:53.600]   And all the way down as he's hook writing in Vox says, all the way down the line to a clerk
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:55.600]   who could write this warrant.
[00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.600]   It's called judicial shopping.
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:04.600]   And it's looking for somebody, anybody, a municipal court clerk with no law training can actually
[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:05.600]   write a warrant.
[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:10.600]   So he says it's an issue because of the weakening of the Fourth Amendment, basically.
[00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:16.600]   Yeah, like it, or rather, you know, we may assume that this is a huge, huge protection, but it
[00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:22.600]   doesn't necessarily mean that it's going to be impossible now except in the very specific
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:24.600]   cases where this is needed.
[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:27.600]   So it might make it a little bit harder.
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:28.600]   Sure.
[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:33.600]   But we still shouldn't go, okay, now we're protected in this way.
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:38.600]   And we don't have to worry about police getting this in maybe cases where it's not necessary because
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:43.600]   as we see, like there are opportunities for them to still get these warrants.
[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:47.600]   But Ben, was it Ben who thought it was great news?
[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:49.600]   I mean, I thought it was better.
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:50.600]   Yeah.
[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:52.600]   Yeah, Devindra thought it was great news.
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:57.600]   I mean, where I'd be really interested to see if this extends farther into the realm of
[00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:03.600]   cell phones because the same doctrine that you're getting too much information applies to any
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.600]   time you search a cell phone.
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:09.600]   You're getting somebody's entire life is stored in this little device.
[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:10.600]   Yeah.
[00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:13.600]   I think that's really the key, right?
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:16.600]   It's an awareness that the cell phone, oh, they're not just tracking location.
[00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:20.600]   It's everything tied to that location data and what it means.
[00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:23.600]   And what I found fascinating about this is just like that greater awareness.
[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:28.600]   So yeah, it's not a complete fix, but hopefully it'll lead to other decisions that I don't
[00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:33.600]   have a wider understanding of what technology actually can do today.
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:39.600]   Roberts also said, by the way, that it really only affects long-term gathering of data, at
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.600]   the time, a week or more.
[00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:46.600]   He said, now that wasn't in the decision, but he said that it wasn't ruling on efforts
[00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:48.600]   to collect information for shorter spans.
[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:53.600]   So it's possible, I suppose, to interpret it that well, if you only want where was Devindra
[00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:54.600]   last night, that's okay.
[00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:56.600]   You don't need a warrant for that.
[00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:59.600]   But if you want to know where was Devindra all last night, I don't know why I'm picking
[00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:00.600]   on you, Devindra.
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.600]   I was gone all asleep.
[00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:03.600]   Nobody knows.
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:04.600]   I was offline.
[00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:06.600]   Not paying attention to news.
[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:07.600]   Tech is in shifty.
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:08.600]   Yeah.
[00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:14.600]   Technology companies, including Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, Verizon, Verizon, Twitter, and Google
[00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:19.600]   all file amicus briefs urging the court to protect the data.
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:28.600]   I think this is good news, Leo, and that, like Mike has said, it's a small hurdle, right?
[00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:35.600]   But it is incremental, and it also establishes a record in a way that it might not have established
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:41.800]   a record before or without this kind of needing to get a warrant, right?
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:46.560]   And I don't think it solves any of the big issues of data privacy and user understanding
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:52.600]   of what information they're putting out into the world and on their devices.
[00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:57.960]   But I do think that it's helpful to at least make law enforcement, force law enforcement
[00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:04.600]   to at least go through some of the basic steps of getting permission to collect this data.
[00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:07.760]   I think in that regard, it's a good thing.
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:11.360]   Any step we take towards better cell phone privacy, I think is going to be important.
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:15.960]   It's interesting that Verizon was filed to meet up with us because Verizon famously was
[00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:21.520]   the one that used the super cookie that if you were a Verizon customer, they would sell
[00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:25.760]   the information of that super cookie to have the highest bidder.
[00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:29.800]   So if somebody wanted to track you, basically they could use that to track you.
[00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:32.680]   Verizon did stop that practice after the FCC went after them.
[00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:37.320]   But they're not known for privacy advocacy.
[00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:38.320]   No.
[00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:40.920]   I think one more like a visible thing, right?
[00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:44.600]   You show that you care about privacy in a certain way.
[00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:47.560]   And I should say technically I work for Verizon too.
[00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:49.520]   So it's all very confusing.
[00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:52.360]   I would like it as a company to be better about these things for sure.
[00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:56.680]   Well, I think that's the other thing is that we're starting to be a little more sophisticated
[00:11:56.680 --> 00:12:01.080]   in our understanding of companies that they're not exactly monolithic.
[00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:02.080]   Right.
[00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:08.120]   So, Verizon who support data privacy and then there are other people selling your information
[00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:10.480]   to the highest bidder.
[00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:11.920]   One company can have both.
[00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:12.920]   Whole departments.
[00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:13.920]   Yeah.
[00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:14.920]   Whole departments.
[00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:15.920]   Yeah.
[00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:16.920]   Yeah.
[00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:17.920]   For Verizon was one of the cell companies.
[00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:21.000]   I'm sure who had this portal for law enforcement to find out where anybody was.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.880]   Speaking of that portal, Leo, I mean, I have to be honest with you.
[00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:29.920]   I think one of the good things about these rulings is that it puts this stuff out into
[00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:35.080]   the public a little bit more so that people can learn about this kind of thing.
[00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:38.920]   Because the thing that I'm being honest about is I didn't know that there was a portal that
[00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:43.400]   you could pay a little bit of money and then get someone's cell location data.
[00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:44.760]   That's horrifying.
[00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:49.240]   And if we know that that was a possibility in the past, like at least people know that
[00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:52.720]   and know that what this warrant does is changes that.
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:58.320]   And maybe we aren't in complete control, but it starts with having this knowledge in the
[00:12:58.320 --> 00:12:59.320]   first place.
[00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:03.600]   And so when the Supreme Court gets involved, usually it's going to work its way out a little
[00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:07.440]   bit more to the public and they will be more aware of these things.
[00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:08.440]   And that's good.
[00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:09.440]   Yeah.
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:14.320]   And Mack and May, you might remember with the story about Secure Us, which was a company
[00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:18.960]   that, a major business was prison phones.
[00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:21.800]   They made a lot of money charging prisoners for phone calls.
[00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:26.280]   But they were collecting privacy data from AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile and Sprint.
[00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:30.000]   Particularly location data and selling it.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.080]   So the cell carriers were selling it to Secure Us.
[00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:37.240]   And then Secure Us was passing along to anybody who wanted.
[00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:40.080]   And the New York Times broke that story in May.
[00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:42.120]   So this is, I think, a good step.
[00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:45.360]   And I don't know if this affects Secure Us business, but I hope it does.
[00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:49.440]   I would love to see it put him out of business, frankly.
[00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:52.440]   Decision number two might be a little more controversial.
[00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:54.560]   This has gone on for a long time.
[00:13:54.560 --> 00:14:01.240]   This debate over whether e-commerce providers should be required to collect state sales
[00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:03.160]   tax.
[00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:08.720]   And the Supreme Court ruled that indeed they should.
[00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:13.720]   The state's now could force online retailers to collect tax for them.
[00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:19.040]   For a long time, I think one of the things that really made Amazon a success was, and
[00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:24.000]   I know I took advantage of this, you wouldn't be charged, you know, in California it's
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.040]   eight and a quarter percent, something like that for sales tax.
[00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:29.520]   That's a big saving so you'd buy from Amazon.
[00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:31.080]   A couple of problems with that.
[00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:35.200]   First of all, the state of California, I don't know what other states do, but other states
[00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:36.200]   do this too.
[00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:41.680]   On the yearly tax form says, "Did you buy anything and not pay sales tax because you
[00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:42.680]   still owe it?"
[00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:43.960]   Yeah, please pay us.
[00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:46.720]   And how much was that and send us the amount?
[00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:50.760]   And which means you'd have to lie on your state tax return if you didn't want to pay
[00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:51.760]   that tax.
[00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:53.920]   So that was problem number one.
[00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:55.120]   I'm not saying what I did.
[00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:56.120]   I don't know.
[00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:57.120]   Right?
[00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:58.120]   [laughter]
[00:14:58.120 --> 00:14:59.120]   Maury.
[00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:00.720]   Maury does my taxes.
[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:02.080]   I'm sure he did the right thing.
[00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:04.760]   I have no idea.
[00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:10.560]   And then secondly, it was a big disadvantage for our local bookstore, for instance, that
[00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:13.160]   did have to charge sales tax.
[00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:17.480]   The original idea was if you don't have business presence in a state, you don't have to collect
[00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:18.480]   sales tax.
[00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:19.480]   Now you do.
[00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:21.640]   Amazon, by the way, had changed that policy.
[00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:23.240]   They went back and forth with California.
[00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:29.480]   At one point, they stopped paying associates fees in California as a way to strong arm
[00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:33.480]   the state legislature not to force them to collect the sales tax.
[00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:34.480]   Then they negotiated.
[00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:37.080]   They said, "All right, we're going to give you a few years window.
[00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:38.680]   Now Amazon does."
[00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:42.600]   But what I didn't know is it only collects sales tax on the stuff it sells directly,
[00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:44.400]   which is about 50% of Amazon sales.
[00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:47.920]   All the marketplace sales, the third-party sales, Amazon says, "Well, that's up to the
[00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:48.920]   marketplace, Fender.
[00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:49.920]   You don't collect them."
[00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:51.480]   I was wondering how that worked.
[00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:52.480]   Yeah.
[00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:55.280]   Amazon only collects about half of the sales taxes.
[00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:57.280]   But it's people like, "What is it?
[00:15:57.280 --> 00:15:58.280]   Overbuy?
[00:15:58.280 --> 00:15:59.280]   What is it?"
[00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:00.280]   Overstock?
[00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:04.800]   Overbuy would be a good name for anybody that I spent overstock.
[00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:09.720]   Etsy worked very concerned about this because they don't.
[00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:12.760]   "Okay, this may be controversial.
[00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:17.920]   For a long time, the standard belief of internet fans was, "No, they shouldn't have to pay."
[00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:19.640]   I think they should have to pay sales taxes.
[00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:21.440]   It's only fair.
[00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:22.440]   Collect them.
[00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:23.440]   Not pay them.
[00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:24.440]   I'm with you.
[00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:31.760]   I think as a person who drives on the highways in the state that I live in and wants family
[00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:36.080]   members to get good education in the state that I live in and good health care and wherever
[00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:39.760]   all the sales tax money goes, obviously I want it for that.
[00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:44.240]   As a person who does most of their shopping on Amazon, it kind of stinks.
[00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:49.200]   But moreover, I think that this makes...I'm already paying it elsewhere when I go to a
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:51.280]   sort very rarely.
[00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:52.280]   I'm paying it there.
[00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:54.600]   But that's why you don't go to brick and mortar.
[00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:56.920]   That's why downtown, wherever the hell it is you live...
[00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:58.840]   Well, it's because I don't like being around a lot of people.
[00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:00.920]   Well, that's another reason.
[00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:04.480]   But downtown, where do you live in Missouri?
[00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:06.320]   I live in southern Missouri.
[00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:10.320]   How you won't tell us the town, but how is the downtown where you are?
[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:11.320]   Is it vital?
[00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:12.320]   Is it growing?
[00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:13.920]   Are there lots of bookstores and coffee shops?
[00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:18.880]   It's vital and it's growing, but I get your point here where these smaller stores don't
[00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:20.320]   get as much frequent.
[00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:21.680]   Don't get frequented as much.
[00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:26.160]   But one thing to understand about the Midwest and especially the town that I live in, there
[00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:33.160]   are quite a few people who are in older age groups who would do a lot less shopping than
[00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:34.160]   I do online.
[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:36.880]   And so those places still get frequented quite a bit.
[00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:37.880]   Interesting.
[00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:42.400]   Yeah, because Petaluma, I can tell you, we're lucky we have a, believe it or not, an independent
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:46.920]   bookstore, one of the few towns in the country that still has a private bookstore in its
[00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:47.920]   town.
[00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:49.560]   Thank God.
[00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:51.320]   But mostly it's antique stores downtown.
[00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:53.480]   I mean, all the regular retailers are gone.
[00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:54.640]   There was a department store.
[00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:55.640]   It's gone.
[00:17:55.640 --> 00:18:00.880]   There's a lot of reasons people buy online, but certainly giving them an 8 and a quarter
[00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:04.240]   percent advantage seems somewhat unfair.
[00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:05.240]   Yeah.
[00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:07.040]   It seems like it's about time.
[00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:09.640]   We had a really good run of the internet.
[00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:13.160]   Commerce kind of getting up there after a certain point, it didn't make sense to charge
[00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:14.160]   tax.
[00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:17.600]   And at this point, I do want those small businesses to survive.
[00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:22.600]   You know, I'd like to walk down the street here in Brooklyn and get like my, you know,
[00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:24.720]   go to independent bookstores as well.
[00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:29.920]   So it stinks, I think, for a lot of people who rely on that to stout, but it's only fair
[00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:30.920]   at this point.
[00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:31.920]   Come on.
[00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:32.920]   It's up to you.
[00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:39.320]   It's up to you, Ben, to defend the entrepreneurial spirit of this made this country strong.
[00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:40.320]   Oh, man.
[00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:43.800]   No, I mean, I hate to admit it, but I'm for it too.
[00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:48.520]   I do think that the sort of the e-commerce is mature enough now that it can sort of bear
[00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:50.840]   the weight of this, so to speak.
[00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:55.840]   I do think that it's a good thing overall.
[00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:57.600]   I mean, I live in Massachusetts.
[00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:01.400]   We love taxes here.
[00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:05.040]   And I think the state benefits from that.
[00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:08.840]   And so I think, you know, like, I think this change is good.
[00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:11.560]   I think the ruling is going to be a positive thing.
[00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:16.040]   I don't think it's going to wreck anything or I do think that it's going to be harder
[00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:20.520]   for some smaller retailers in some ways.
[00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:23.040]   But I think overall it's going to be a good thing.
[00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:27.080]   It wasn't small retailers that challenged the South Dakota law that ended up in the
[00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:28.080]   Supreme Court.
[00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:30.440]   It was way fair, overstocking new egg.
[00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:32.640]   Those are the three.
[00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:33.880]   And there was a precedent.
[00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:39.480]   In 1992, the Supreme Court had barred states from requiring businesses with no physical
[00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:42.360]   presence to collect sales taxes.
[00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:44.160]   So that was the precedent.
[00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:48.480]   And I guess you probably could look back and say, well, in 1992, there wasn't a lot
[00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:50.320]   of e-commerce and all long comes.
[00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:56.160]   All of these online stores that really benefit, I think it's reasonable now to say, okay,
[00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:58.280]   Amazon's big enough.
[00:19:58.280 --> 00:19:59.720]   They can collect sales tax.
[00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:01.680]   Yeah, almost too big, honestly.
[00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:05.280]   We're looking at everything Amazon is doing now.
[00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:07.360]   Amazon is terrifying as a company.
[00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:12.400]   So yeah, this taxes mainly to make Amazon give up a little more.
[00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:15.200]   It's an interesting cultural shift, isn't it?
[00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:18.200]   In 1992, we wanted more e-commerce.
[00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:19.400]   Now here we are.
[00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:20.400]   What is it?
[00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:26.000]   28 years later, now 26 years later, we'd...
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.720]   45 years later.
[00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:30.880]   Now you know why I shop at overbuy.com.
[00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:31.880]   Overbuy and waste.
[00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:36.960]   Here it is, 26 years later.
[00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:42.120]   And we're kind of saying, maybe we let these companies get too big.
[00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:44.200]   Let's bring back the mom and pop shops.
[00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:46.120]   I'd love to see some downtown retail.
[00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:47.120]   Totally.
[00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:51.200]   People even shop downtown as a political statement almost, right?
[00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:52.200]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:56.960]   You mentioned some of the big places here in the town in which I live.
[00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:59.280]   And they're like, you shop there.
[00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:00.280]   You go there.
[00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:01.280]   I'm sorry.
[00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:02.280]   You're talking Walmart.
[00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:03.280]   You're talking Walmart, right?
[00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:05.080]   Well, like Walmart are saying Starbucks even.
[00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:08.400]   They're like, wait, you don't go to the local, I didn't know what they'd call it, like the
[00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:10.280]   brown coffee bean or something.
[00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:13.080]   How dare you not frequent the brown coffee bean.
[00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:17.000]   We had a cute little coffee shop in town called Def Dog Coffee.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.080]   It was really great coffee.
[00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:20.280]   And it really pissed me off.
[00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:23.640]   Starbucks opened the store across the street.
[00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:24.640]   And they're gone.
[00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:25.640]   Sorry about that, man.
[00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:26.640]   Def Dog.
[00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:27.640]   That's Starbucks.
[00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:28.640]   Starbucks is far from gone.
[00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:29.640]   There's so many Starbucks now.
[00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:33.680]   There's a Starbucks in Canada with a Starbucks in the restroom.
[00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:34.880]   No, I'm kidding.
[00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:35.880]   Wait, wait.
[00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:36.880]   There's a...
[00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:37.880]   That was really good.
[00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:38.880]   No, there's a...
[00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:40.920]   But there is an intersection.
[00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:44.840]   I think it's in Vancouver with Starbucks on two corners of the floor.
[00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:45.840]   Every corner.
[00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:47.880]   So you don't have to cross the street.
[00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:51.640]   Why would you want to cross the street to get a cup of coffee?
[00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:54.440]   It's like mattress room in the northeast.
[00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:56.440]   Are they everywhere?
[00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:57.440]   Yeah.
[00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:58.440]   Mattress firm is everywhere.
[00:21:58.440 --> 00:21:59.440]   We have a mattress.
[00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:01.440]   We have a mattress that you need.
[00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:02.440]   Yeah.
[00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:04.680]   That's actually an interesting business.
[00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:08.840]   I mean, you look at all the now online retail's, Casper's, sponsor of ours, but there's a ton
[00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:10.840]   of them, right?
[00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:15.080]   And I think they really came around because companies like mattress firm had such huge
[00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:16.240]   markups.
[00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:17.240]   It was almost...
[00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:18.240]   It was almost...
[00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:20.920]   I don't want to say a criminal enterprise, but...
[00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:22.640]   They're pretty close.
[00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:23.640]   It was like...
[00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:26.480]   They had like 100% markups and more.
[00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:27.480]   And so that was a real...
[00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:29.480]   What it really was an opportunity.
[00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:33.200]   I mean, you have to be on a bed that other people have also...
[00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:35.400]   That hundreds of people have also lied down.
[00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:36.400]   Oh, come on.
[00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:38.080]   It's not like they had sex on it.
[00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:39.080]   They're just...
[00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:40.080]   They're fully closed.
[00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:42.320]   No, but they spread their germs all over it.
[00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:43.320]   And that's not...
[00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:45.560]   Now I know why you don't shop downtown, Micah.
[00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:46.560]   Yes.
[00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:47.560]   I got to stay away from those germs.
[00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:48.560]   People!
[00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:51.320]   They're full of germs.
[00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:54.560]   You can't see this, but there's a big bubble around me just outside of the frame.
[00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:56.560]   Oh boy, Micah Sargent joining us.
[00:22:56.560 --> 00:23:01.320]   The great thing about Internet commerce, I guess, is that it's really broken.
[00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:03.240]   Those old models like, yeah, mattress store.
[00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:05.800]   You walk in and there's like financing information.
[00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:10.160]   You have to finance your mattress because it's too expensive to pay all at once for most
[00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:11.160]   people.
[00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:12.160]   It's insane.
[00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:13.160]   So I have a Casper.
[00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:14.160]   I love it.
[00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:15.160]   And stick with those.
[00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:17.160]   And actually that's become a whole category.
[00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:18.680]   Dollar Shave Club.
[00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:20.520]   Another sponsor of ours.
[00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:24.280]   Thank God for this category, by the way.
[00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:25.920]   The glasses, Warby Parker.
[00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:26.920]   Warby's so good man.
[00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:32.120]   Because Laxotica bought up all and got a monopoly basically on frames and started charging hundreds
[00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:35.040]   of dollars for frames and opened in a way.
[00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:39.480]   And I guess what we're saying is you don't need sales tax advantage because there's other
[00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:41.320]   ways you can have an advantage as an e.
[00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:45.880]   And now that people are comfortable with e-commerce, there's plenty of opportunities.
[00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:51.720]   I was about to say, I think, Lee, you're demonstrating to us that sales tax, that this
[00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:54.840]   tax issue is not going to break e-commerce.
[00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:59.080]   I think e-commerce is going to be OK.
[00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:05.680]   Speaking of which, it's time for a visit from one of our advertisers.
[00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:06.680]   And you know what they do?
[00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:08.960]   They make it so you don't have to go to the post office.
[00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:16.000]   Why get exposed to all those germs from people at the post office when you're licking their
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   stamps?
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:24.720]   I have a post office box.
[00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:28.160]   I have an old key and it's an old pedal in a post office.
[00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:29.800]   I don't love doing that.
[00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:32.520]   But what I don't want to do is wait in the line to buy stamps.
[00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:34.760]   You don't have to with stamps.com.
[00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:38.680]   When I need stamps, I can print them on my computer, my printer.
[00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:40.680]   It is fantastic.
[00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:41.680]   Postage on demand.
[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:43.200]   It's not just postage.
[00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:45.080]   Everything you would do at the post office.
[00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:47.000]   You could do with stamps.com.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:52.080]   Not only buy and print US postage for any letter, any package, any class of mail, the
[00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:56.200]   mail carrier comes and gets it so you don't have to get up from your seat.
[00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:57.680]   They will fill out the forms for you.
[00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:01.520]   If you're an Etsy or an eBay seller and you don't have to fill out the customs forms
[00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:04.680]   if you're selling internationally, it prints a beautiful label for your package.
[00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:08.520]   It will suggest more affordable ways to send that package.
[00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:09.520]   You can buy insurance.
[00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:12.200]   Actually, you get a better deal on insurance from stamps.com.
[00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:13.840]   They sell the same insurance.
[00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:16.880]   But they've got discounts you can't get at the post office.
[00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:17.880]   I can go on and on.
[00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:20.520]   It really is a fantastic deal.
[00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:22.080]   You'll create your counted minutes.
[00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:23.720]   There's no equipment to lease.
[00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:24.920]   It's not postage meter.
[00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:25.920]   No, no.
[00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:27.000]   You've got the equipment you need.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:28.280]   No long term commitment either.
[00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:30.480]   They'll even send you a digital USB scale.
[00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:32.360]   They'll calculate the exact postage.
[00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:36.680]   If you've ever done this, added a few extra stamps just so you don't send it postage
[00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:37.680]   due or worse.
[00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:39.400]   I got a package.
[00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:43.800]   It really is unprofessional from a PR firm that it was postage due.
[00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:48.320]   It's like that is not a good way to introduce your client to a journalist.
[00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:50.520]   Are you going to pay to get this product?
[00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:55.400]   No, it's exactly the right postage, pay neither too much or too little.
[00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:59.040]   They'll even help you decide the best class of mail, save you money.
[00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:01.040]   They'll do all the confirmation information.
[00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:02.040]   They'll fill out of the form.
[00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:03.760]   Look, here's the deal.
[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:04.960]   You can use stamps.com right now.
[00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:07.320]   We have a remarkable offer.
[00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:09.960]   It's a $55 worth of free postage.
[00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:10.960]   It's a digital scale.
[00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:11.960]   It's a four week trial.
[00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:13.640]   All you have to do is see that microphone in the upper right hand corner.
[00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:14.840]   It's stamps.com.
[00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:17.960]   Click that at the top of the page right there.
[00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:18.960]   Enter Twit.
[00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:20.120]   I have to walk Carson through it.
[00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:22.760]   He's only done it a thousand times.
[00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:24.160]   Then you get our special deal.
[00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:25.400]   Go ahead, press go.
[00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:26.400]   Look at that.
[00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:28.960]   It's even got a picture of me.
[00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:32.360]   $55 in free postage, a free digital scale.
[00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:33.760]   $5 supply kit.
[00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:34.840]   Why wouldn't you do it?
[00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:37.920]   Go to stamps.com, use the offer code Twit.
[00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:39.360]   I think you'll never go back.
[00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:41.320]   There's an example, right?
[00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:44.000]   They call it Indicia.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:49.500]   Actually it was to the US government's credit that they allowed companies to do this some
[00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:52.360]   years ago, create stamps.
[00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:55.920]   It really was a big win for everybody all around.
[00:26:55.920 --> 00:27:00.120]   Very much what we were talking about.
[00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:04.880]   Devindra, are you going to run out and buy the Oppo Find X phone?
[00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:06.240]   Did you see this?
[00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:07.440]   I've seen it.
[00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:09.520]   It's a really cool idea.
[00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:12.680]   It's got a motorized camera.
[00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:15.880]   No camera bump, no notch.
[00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:19.080]   You don't have to worry about putting your finger on the camera or anything.
[00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:20.680]   It slides up.
[00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:22.880]   In fact, it doesn't have a fingerprint reader on it.
[00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:25.920]   You have to use face recognition.
[00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:29.360]   According to the Verge, I haven't played with it, but according to the Verge, slides
[00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:33.480]   up in under half a second and slides back down again to do your face recognition.
[00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:36.440]   I honestly miss the little moving parts in phones.
[00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:39.200]   I remember the Helio Ocean before the smartphones.
[00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:40.800]   - No, I was gonna say this same thing.
[00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:41.800]   I was gonna say the same thing.
[00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:42.640]   So good.
[00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:43.720]   - Yeah.
[00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:44.560]   - I want more gears.
[00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:45.620]   I want it to go.
[00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:46.540]   - Yeah.
[00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:47.380]   Exactly.
[00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:49.760]   - I love sliding phones.
[00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:50.600]   You know what I--
[00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:51.440]   - You know, when I--
[00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:52.420]   - Anything with sliding or flipping open.
[00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:53.880]   I totally miss that.
[00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:55.560]   I don't know why.
[00:27:55.560 --> 00:28:00.560]   - It's good, because it's not slavish copying of Apple.
[00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:01.440]   - Sure.
[00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:05.640]   - I got, this is the Huawei P20 phone with a notch.
[00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:08.140]   In fact, they've modified Android
[00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:10.480]   to be more like the Apple user interface,
[00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:12.480]   which makes it not so good.
[00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:16.560]   Why slavishly copy Apple?
[00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:18.920]   But now, of course, this may wear out.
[00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:20.840]   Who knows how it's gonna work.
[00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:22.040]   - Yeah, it's one more thing to break.
[00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:24.120]   So it's a cool idea.
[00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:26.440]   I wouldn't wanna rely on it for my day to day.
[00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:29.280]   But yeah, I was just in Computex in Taipei
[00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:30.480]   a couple weeks ago, and man,
[00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:32.440]   everyone just wants to copy Apple.
[00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:34.160]   And it's kind of sad, yeah.
[00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:36.080]   - How was that?
[00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:37.360]   Did you enjoy Computex?
[00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:38.200]   - I did.
[00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:40.580]   I'm a, you know, it's a show that I think a lot of people say.
[00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:42.060]   It's probably a little too old fashioned,
[00:28:42.060 --> 00:28:43.820]   but I really enjoy it.
[00:28:43.820 --> 00:28:46.660]   'Cause I like PCs and I like PC hardware.
[00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:48.700]   I wrote a big PC and gadget about,
[00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:53.740]   honestly, right now PCs are so interesting and so exciting
[00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:54.580]   and so interesting.
[00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:56.140]   And we're gonna talk about the Mac hardware.
[00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:59.000]   You know, what Apple is doing, I think,
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:02.740]   is so boring and dull in comparison.
[00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:04.060]   You look at gaming laptops now.
[00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:06.840]   They're getting thin and light, you know, decent hardware
[00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:09.140]   in there under five pounds.
[00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:11.300]   It's pretty great right now for a while.
[00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:14.780]   The PC industry was merely copying the Macbook Air.
[00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:15.620]   - Yeah.
[00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:18.020]   - But the UltraBook was, this is really interesting.
[00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:20.660]   You wrote about this, this is the Asus ZenBook S,
[00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:23.260]   which has a screen where the mousepad is.
[00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:24.100]   - Yep.
[00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:24.940]   - The trackpad.
[00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:26.100]   - Pretty, it's wild, it's wild.
[00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:29.260]   And it's far more useful than the touch bar
[00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:31.140]   because you can't do much with the touch bar,
[00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:33.380]   but this thing, it's basically a second monitor.
[00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:35.220]   So you could drag a YouTube video down there,
[00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:37.620]   you could use this second screen for whatever
[00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:38.460]   while you're working.
[00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:40.220]   It still works as a touchpad too.
[00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:43.020]   So it's a wild idea, you know, it's an Asus product.
[00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:46.260]   So, mileage varies on like how well it'll work,
[00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:49.500]   but I love the conception and I love the execution there.
[00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:52.300]   - I actually, I kind of, I have a soft spot for Asus.
[00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:54.020]   I don't, maybe 'cause I used to buy them other boards.
[00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:55.100]   - Yeah, my first motherboard wasn't a Asus.
[00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:56.780]   - Exactly. - So I have to get.
[00:29:56.780 --> 00:29:57.620]   - Yeah.
[00:29:57.620 --> 00:30:00.180]   Do you see anything else you found interesting?
[00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:02.180]   - Well, they have that crazy gaming phone too,
[00:30:02.180 --> 00:30:05.020]   the ROG phone, which, you know,
[00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:07.100]   I'm not a fan of these gaming centric phones,
[00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:10.420]   but basically that thing is the most powerful smartphone
[00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:12.700]   on the market or will be when it's released.
[00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:14.860]   So they have some cool accessories for that.
[00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:18.740]   Just lots of cool, you know, ideas floating around there.
[00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:21.780]   And general, you know, we saw this,
[00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:23.340]   they're dual screen PCs.
[00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:24.980]   These concepts popping up everywhere.
[00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:27.980]   Asus had one, Lenovo had one piece.
[00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:29.740]   - Wasn't there one where there's no keyboard?
[00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:32.100]   It's just a screen and then a screen?
[00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:32.940]   - Yep, two screens.
[00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:33.780]   Like that's it.
[00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:34.620]   That's what we're seeing now.
[00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:36.580]   So Lenovo announced the next,
[00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:40.300]   I forget what it's called, the Yoka tab or one of those.
[00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:42.220]   And then Asus has a concept product.
[00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:43.540]   We saw this thing from Intel.
[00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:46.540]   One side is an E-ink display
[00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:49.060]   and the other side is a normal display.
[00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:51.740]   Just lots of cool ideas like that.
[00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:54.620]   - I have to say it is an exciting arena
[00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:55.700]   where there was, for a while,
[00:30:55.700 --> 00:30:57.300]   there wasn't very much innovation.
[00:30:57.300 --> 00:31:00.820]   There was the beige box era where everything looked the same.
[00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:03.580]   And then there was the copy Apple era
[00:31:03.580 --> 00:31:04.940]   where everything was the same
[00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:06.380]   'cause it all looked like Apple stuff.
[00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:08.420]   But Apple's kind of dropped the,
[00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:10.060]   all right, let's get to the Apple story
[00:31:10.060 --> 00:31:11.700]   'cause that's the big story.
[00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:14.500]   I feel like Apple's dropped the ball a little bit.
[00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:18.620]   They finally admitted that there's a problem
[00:31:18.620 --> 00:31:20.820]   with the keyboards on the new MacBooks.
[00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:26.060]   I kind of enjoyed Josh Topolsky's outline,
[00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:29.540]   headline on this, on the outline.
[00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:30.380]   What are they right?
[00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:33.180]   Like Apple capitulates, Apple's surrenders.
[00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:34.740]   It was, I can't remember.
[00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:38.060]   It really isn't that bad, but they finally did admit
[00:31:38.060 --> 00:31:39.620]   that there is something wrong
[00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:41.900]   and that if you bought a MacBook,
[00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:44.780]   or you bought one of the new MacBook Pros
[00:31:44.780 --> 00:31:47.500]   with these new butterfly keys, yeah, there it is,
[00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:51.020]   Apple admits its computers are broken.
[00:31:51.020 --> 00:31:53.180]   That's a little strong.
[00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:54.020]   I'm not sure.
[00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:56.260]   I'm not sure Apple admitted its computers are broken.
[00:31:56.260 --> 00:31:58.500]   But they did admit there's a problem with the keyboards
[00:31:58.500 --> 00:31:59.620]   and they're offering free repairs.
[00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:02.940]   Even more than that, if you got it repaired earlier
[00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:04.940]   and paid for it, they're gonna refund.
[00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:08.460]   That from Apple, that's unheard of.
[00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:09.300]   - That's great.
[00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:11.940]   That's what Microsoft did with the red ring of death problem
[00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:14.060]   for the Xbox, so this is a problem on that level,
[00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:14.980]   pretty much for Apple.
[00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:17.940]   - It cost Microsoft more than a billion dollars
[00:32:17.940 --> 00:32:19.980]   to fix all those red rings.
[00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:24.060]   They took a huge tax right off
[00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:25.980]   with the red ring of death problem.
[00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:29.420]   So why does it take so long for them to admit issues
[00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:30.580]   like this?
[00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:32.060]   That's an open question.
[00:32:32.060 --> 00:32:32.900]   I'm just--
[00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:35.700]   - I think it's just, it's Apple, right?
[00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:39.100]   When I, like anything, if you write about Apple thing,
[00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:42.060]   I will get contacted from Apple PR.
[00:32:42.060 --> 00:32:43.540]   Like we don't like this word.
[00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:45.060]   We don't like the way you phrase this.
[00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:47.460]   It's such a defensive company,
[00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:50.220]   and it's kinda ridiculous 'cause you guys are winning.
[00:32:50.220 --> 00:32:52.700]   You're, you're, you'll be fine.
[00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:54.140]   You can withstand a little criticism.
[00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:56.020]   - You're gonna be a trillion dollar company.
[00:32:56.020 --> 00:32:59.380]   They're the most successful company in the history of companies.
[00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:03.260]   - Three could do so much for your rep by just like--
[00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:06.260]   - Well, you don't wanna admit it too fast either, right?
[00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:07.100]   What if there isn't?
[00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:08.180]   - Sure.
[00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:09.580]   - And Apple for a long time said, no,
[00:33:09.580 --> 00:33:11.940]   in fact they still say it's a small,
[00:33:11.940 --> 00:33:14.340]   today we launched a keyboard service program
[00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:16.460]   for a small percentage of keyboards.
[00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:18.100]   And you know, they don't, they still,
[00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:21.420]   and I, by the way, not just Apple, Microsoft,
[00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:22.940]   and this is getting to be a controversy,
[00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:26.580]   still says there's nothing wrong with 1803,
[00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:27.540]   the new Windows update.
[00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:28.380]   There's nothing wrong.
[00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:29.580]   Everybody loves it.
[00:33:29.580 --> 00:33:33.300]   When in fact, a lot of people are reporting massive problems
[00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:34.340]   with the update.
[00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:36.540]   So every company kind of wants to--
[00:33:36.540 --> 00:33:41.100]   - And I wonder if it's about sort of hedging bets maybe.
[00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:43.740]   So sort of seeing if, you know, we've heard this,
[00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:47.100]   and maybe it's just some people that are particularly loud
[00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:47.940]   and then-- - Right.
[00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:48.860]   - Where your story spreads. - You never know.
[00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:51.340]   - Versus, and so if you, if you admit too soon,
[00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:53.500]   then you end up spending a whole bunch of money
[00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:55.340]   where if the problem goes away,
[00:33:55.340 --> 00:33:57.380]   then they don't end up having to spend
[00:33:57.380 --> 00:34:00.500]   on these repair and return programs.
[00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:03.420]   But I'm glad that this one is getting taken care of.
[00:34:03.420 --> 00:34:08.420]   And it does seem to be in no small part influenced
[00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:12.860]   by the coverage that took place,
[00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:14.940]   not just the fact that there are people
[00:34:14.940 --> 00:34:16.140]   who have this keyboard problem,
[00:34:16.140 --> 00:34:18.620]   but all of the coverage that's taken place
[00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:19.860]   about this particular issue.
[00:34:19.860 --> 00:34:22.860]   - Well, and there are three class action lawsuits.
[00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:23.940]   - Oh yeah, that's right.
[00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:27.460]   But yeah, when Renee Ritchie, who is in, you know,
[00:34:27.460 --> 00:34:29.780]   we work with him, we love him, he's on Mac Break Weekly,
[00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:31.980]   but and he loves Apple. - Yes.
[00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:33.660]   - When he says there's a problem,
[00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:35.260]   then I think you start to pay attention.
[00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:37.500]   - That is sort of my like stick the finger out
[00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:39.180]   and feel which way the wind is blowing things.
[00:34:39.180 --> 00:34:41.580]   Like if Renee is going, yeah, this is really bad
[00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:43.900]   that I'm like, wow, this must really be bad.
[00:34:43.900 --> 00:34:45.220]   (laughing)
[00:34:45.220 --> 00:34:47.060]   - And again, notice that-- - Renee finally admits
[00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:49.300]   Apple's laptops are broken.
[00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:50.460]   - They're fine, they're broken.
[00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:51.380]   - Yeah.
[00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:53.860]   - I mean, and this goes back to 2015.
[00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:56.900]   This is the MacBook that came out early 2015.
[00:34:56.900 --> 00:34:59.340]   That was the first design of the butterfly keys.
[00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:02.620]   And then MacBooks from 2016, 2017,
[00:35:02.620 --> 00:35:05.260]   and MacBook Pros from 2016 and 17.
[00:35:05.260 --> 00:35:06.100]   - Yeah.
[00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:07.660]   What's ironic about this whole situation,
[00:35:07.660 --> 00:35:09.660]   I remember when the butterfly keyboards came out
[00:35:09.660 --> 00:35:12.260]   and I was complaining about them because they feel awful.
[00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:13.740]   They were terrible to type on.
[00:35:13.740 --> 00:35:16.340]   And it takes a bit of learning because it's so shallow.
[00:35:16.340 --> 00:35:18.140]   There's no like key depth there.
[00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:21.220]   And Apple's big reason for making this change, they said,
[00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:23.740]   is that it would not break as much.
[00:35:23.740 --> 00:35:25.740]   You wouldn't get crumbs under the keys.
[00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:28.780]   And it's kind of hilarious that after all that,
[00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:29.740]   yeah, the keys break.
[00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:31.580]   And when they break, you can't just replace the keyboard.
[00:35:31.580 --> 00:35:33.140]   They get to replace the whole top,
[00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:35.220]   the whole front of the laptop.
[00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:39.060]   So it's such a mess on many levels for Apple.
[00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:42.420]   - And there are a number of questions still.
[00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:45.780]   Apple says, first of all, you have to have a problem.
[00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:48.140]   If you have to have letters or characters
[00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:50.060]   that repeat unexpectedly,
[00:35:50.060 --> 00:35:53.060]   or don't appear when pressed or keys that feel sticky
[00:35:53.060 --> 00:35:55.260]   or aren't responding in a consistent manner,
[00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:57.780]   what's unclear is what are they gonna do to fix it?
[00:35:57.780 --> 00:35:59.380]   And they say it may involve replacement
[00:35:59.380 --> 00:36:02.020]   or one or more keys or the whole keyboard.
[00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:05.100]   That's a $700 repair if you're out of warranty.
[00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:07.060]   So that's not an insignificant repair.
[00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:08.500]   But I'm with you, Devinda.
[00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:10.740]   But I think that's a matter of opinion,
[00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:11.980]   whether you like the butter,
[00:36:11.980 --> 00:36:12.820]   - Oh sure.
[00:36:12.820 --> 00:36:13.660]   - or not.
[00:36:13.660 --> 00:36:14.500]   I don't like them either.
[00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:16.140]   I got rid of my butterfly key keyboards.
[00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:16.980]   But if you're--
[00:36:16.980 --> 00:36:18.380]   - I had to get a mechanical keyboard
[00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:19.940]   like some kind of gaming jerk.
[00:36:19.940 --> 00:36:20.780]   - Some kind of tonight.
[00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:21.620]   - Yeah.
[00:36:21.620 --> 00:36:22.460]   - Animal.
[00:36:22.460 --> 00:36:24.220]   Do you, so have you,
[00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:26.820]   but has anybody here experienced the sticky keys
[00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:27.660]   or the problem?
[00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:28.660]   - I haven't, but two of,
[00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:29.940]   I think two of my colleagues
[00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:31.940]   are currently having the same issue with their MacBooks.
[00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:33.460]   - Renee, I think had it on several of them.
[00:36:33.460 --> 00:36:34.300]   - Yep.
[00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:36.420]   Renee had it and a couple more colleagues
[00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:38.660]   from Mobile Nations had it as well.
[00:36:38.660 --> 00:36:41.220]   I didn't, I never got this, that machine.
[00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:43.380]   I'm still rocking the mid-2015 MacBook Pro,
[00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:44.540]   which I love in a door.
[00:36:44.540 --> 00:36:45.380]   - Yeah.
[00:36:45.380 --> 00:36:46.220]   - Just stay there.
[00:36:46.220 --> 00:36:47.060]   - Me too.
[00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:47.900]   I'm using the 2015, I love it.
[00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:49.060]   - Yes, it's a great machine.
[00:36:49.060 --> 00:36:50.500]   - The keys move when you press them.
[00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:51.340]   - Exactly.
[00:36:51.340 --> 00:36:52.180]   - It's amazing.
[00:36:52.180 --> 00:36:53.020]   - They're of course you'll actually use,
[00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:53.860]   it's amazing.
[00:36:53.860 --> 00:36:55.180]   - It's amazing.
[00:36:55.180 --> 00:36:56.820]   - Another 2015 is very good.
[00:36:56.820 --> 00:36:58.900]   Somebody called the radio show today and said,
[00:36:58.900 --> 00:37:01.540]   well, I need a new iMac,
[00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:03.740]   when, when the new one's coming out.
[00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:06.420]   And all I can say is no one has any idea.
[00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:08.540]   Apple's very consistent every year,
[00:37:08.540 --> 00:37:10.500]   you know in the fall there will be a new iPhone.
[00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:13.020]   Every year, for 10 years.
[00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:15.460]   They're less consistent with the iPad,
[00:37:15.460 --> 00:37:16.700]   but it's fairly consistent.
[00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:18.380]   There's new models every year.
[00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:20.180]   With a Macintosh.
[00:37:20.180 --> 00:37:21.020]   Who knows?
[00:37:21.020 --> 00:37:21.860]   - Who knows?
[00:37:21.860 --> 00:37:22.700]   - Yeah.
[00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:23.700]   - There's no consistency at all.
[00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:24.940]   We have no idea.
[00:37:24.940 --> 00:37:27.420]   - So.
[00:37:27.420 --> 00:37:32.620]   I guess there's nothing more to say
[00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:33.940]   if you have one of those keyboards
[00:37:33.940 --> 00:37:35.020]   and you have problems,
[00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:37.380]   bring it to the Apple store and God bless you.
[00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:38.940]   - Spill some jelly on it and take it to the,
[00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:39.780]   no, I'm just kidding.
[00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:40.620]   - I do have to admit.
[00:37:40.620 --> 00:37:41.940]   (laughing)
[00:37:41.940 --> 00:37:42.780]   I'm a bad man.
[00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:43.780]   - I'm a bad man.
[00:37:43.780 --> 00:37:46.180]   - But I think that sometimes maybe the people,
[00:37:46.180 --> 00:37:48.180]   'cause it doesn't happen to everybody.
[00:37:48.540 --> 00:37:50.500]   Does Renee eat over his keyboard or?
[00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:52.260]   (laughing)
[00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:53.100]   - Here we go.
[00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:53.940]   - Hold on, let me call him really quick.
[00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:55.260]   - I have to say.
[00:37:55.260 --> 00:37:57.660]   - Do you drink your Phil's coffee over your keyboard?
[00:37:57.660 --> 00:37:59.060]   - Somebody's eating croissants.
[00:37:59.060 --> 00:38:02.060]   A lot of, you got, yeah, there's gotta be dirt.
[00:38:02.060 --> 00:38:02.900]   What am I trying to say?
[00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:05.220]   Crumbs or something getting it under the keyboard?
[00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:07.220]   - I mean, you're literally gonna get the dirt on it.
[00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:08.860]   - I don't wanna cast the conversions.
[00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:09.700]   - I gotta get the dirt on it.
[00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:14.140]   - But I suspect it might be behaviorally related.
[00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:15.460]   - Yeah, I could see that.
[00:38:15.460 --> 00:38:18.980]   I mean, I don't have any crumbs under my keyboard
[00:38:18.980 --> 00:38:22.100]   and I know it's not that keyboard, but I don't.
[00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:23.020]   - Is that a euphemism?
[00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:25.180]   - Ain't no crumbs under my keyboard.
[00:38:25.180 --> 00:38:27.500]   - Hey, hey, hey, no crumbs under my keyboard.
[00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:29.580]   Not my fault, not my doing.
[00:38:29.580 --> 00:38:30.700]   I like that.
[00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:32.820]   - As long as we're on Apple, I guess they're gonna do
[00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:35.140]   the wireless charger sometime between now and September
[00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:37.300]   according to Mr. Sherman.
[00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:39.700]   Blumberg, Brittany and me.
[00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:43.420]   Blumberg, Mark, who is kind of the most connected Apple
[00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:45.420]   rumor guy.
[00:38:45.420 --> 00:38:48.500]   It says, engineers hoped for a June launch.
[00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:51.380]   They announced it, by the way, a June of last year.
[00:38:51.380 --> 00:38:55.260]   They're aiming for September.
[00:38:55.260 --> 00:38:57.300]   This is unaccountably difficult.
[00:38:57.300 --> 00:38:59.620]   They say, Apple said, or somebody says,
[00:38:59.620 --> 00:39:01.020]   "Oh, it's really hard."
[00:39:01.020 --> 00:39:03.780]   Which I find difficult because in fact,
[00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:05.140]   there are plenty of wireless chargers
[00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:07.700]   that could do multiple devices out.
[00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:09.540]   You just have to put multiple coils in.
[00:39:09.540 --> 00:39:14.940]   - I would really love to skip the next like 15 years
[00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:18.460]   and get to the point where you just put any device down
[00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:20.460]   on any surface and it's charged.
[00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:22.220]   - I would like to skip the next 15 years
[00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:24.260]   for other services. - Air charging.
[00:39:24.260 --> 00:39:25.380]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:39:25.380 --> 00:39:26.700]   - Air charging.
[00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:28.380]   - Problem is, if I skip the next 15 years,
[00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:29.700]   I'll be in a pine box.
[00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:30.700]   So.
[00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:32.500]   - Oh my God.
[00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:34.020]   You better knock on your wood.
[00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:36.500]   - Can I keep my age and skip the next 15 years?
[00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:37.340]   Can I just like, yes, yes.
[00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:38.180]   - I mean, come on Leo.
[00:39:38.180 --> 00:39:40.460]   You know you're gonna upload your brain to the internet, Leo.
[00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:41.940]   That's where everything is going.
[00:39:41.940 --> 00:39:43.780]   - I'm just praying that this comes out
[00:39:43.780 --> 00:39:46.660]   before my, this is, I will,
[00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:49.100]   and I'm hoping that like the guy who's inventing this
[00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:52.820]   right now is a fan and says, you know who we should,
[00:39:52.820 --> 00:39:54.900]   'cause otherwise it's gonna be Ray Kurzweil
[00:39:54.900 --> 00:39:57.700]   or somebody like that, President Trump.
[00:39:57.700 --> 00:39:59.740]   But I'm open to some guy who's like a real guy,
[00:39:59.740 --> 00:40:02.500]   he said, oh, you know who we should really pour into a can?
[00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:04.260]   Leo's brain.
[00:40:04.260 --> 00:40:05.460]   And I volunteer.
[00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:07.460]   You could do it today if you want.
[00:40:07.460 --> 00:40:08.300]   I don't care.
[00:40:08.300 --> 00:40:09.140]   - You would do it today.
[00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:10.700]   If someone genuinely, if someone came to you and said,
[00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:12.700]   you can be uploaded to the internet today,
[00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:13.460]   you would say yes.
[00:40:13.460 --> 00:40:15.020]   Wouldn't you?
[00:40:15.020 --> 00:40:16.020]   Oh, you're young.
[00:40:16.020 --> 00:40:17.780]   - No, not today's internet.
[00:40:17.780 --> 00:40:19.260]   - Your penis still works.
[00:40:19.260 --> 00:40:21.300]   (laughing)
[00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:22.460]   - Oh my God.
[00:40:22.460 --> 00:40:25.660]   - Hey, no crumbs under my keyboard.
[00:40:25.660 --> 00:40:27.020]   (laughing)
[00:40:27.020 --> 00:40:27.940]   - I'm so sorry.
[00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:31.660]   - No, I would do that.
[00:40:31.660 --> 00:40:33.620]   Wouldn't you wanna do that?
[00:40:33.620 --> 00:40:36.140]   You wouldn't wanna do, okay, maybe if you were my age,
[00:40:36.140 --> 00:40:37.780]   would you wanna do that?
[00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:40.540]   - I think I would need someone else to go first, Leo.
[00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:42.820]   So once you did it and if it worked just fine,
[00:40:42.820 --> 00:40:43.660]   then I'll join you.
[00:40:43.660 --> 00:40:45.420]   - That's actually a good point.
[00:40:45.420 --> 00:40:47.900]   'Cause it'd be bad if I were glitchy like in Westworld.
[00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:49.700]   - Yeah, Leo.
[00:40:49.700 --> 00:40:52.620]   - My whiskey would pour out or something.
[00:40:52.620 --> 00:40:53.900]   That would be bad.
[00:40:53.900 --> 00:40:54.740]   What would it be like?
[00:40:54.740 --> 00:40:56.660]   - I asked Leo to grasp Tyson that once
[00:40:56.660 --> 00:40:57.620]   and he said he was like,
[00:40:57.620 --> 00:41:00.780]   you can't go to the beach
[00:41:00.780 --> 00:41:04.300]   if your consciousness is uploaded to the internet.
[00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:05.300]   - In there, done that.
[00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:08.740]   I'm ready to forego sanding between my toes.
[00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:14.660]   But you can't go to the beach, but you could go to Mars, Neil.
[00:41:14.660 --> 00:41:18.340]   You could be anywhere the internet goes forever.
[00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:20.900]   - You could have a robot do this stuff that you wanna do.
[00:41:20.900 --> 00:41:21.740]   - I don't need to feel anything.
[00:41:21.740 --> 00:41:24.540]   - Which, again, back to your early encounter.
[00:41:24.540 --> 00:41:26.980]   - There's people have germs.
[00:41:26.980 --> 00:41:28.940]   I just wanna, so what would it be?
[00:41:28.940 --> 00:41:31.420]   Would it be like my, how would it look?
[00:41:31.420 --> 00:41:33.380]   I wouldn't have a physical manifestation, right?
[00:41:33.380 --> 00:41:35.980]   My consciousness would be in the internet.
[00:41:35.980 --> 00:41:37.900]   - I think that's the idea,
[00:41:37.900 --> 00:41:39.660]   but I would see it more like,
[00:41:39.660 --> 00:41:43.020]   what was that episode of "Black Mirror San Junipero?"
[00:41:43.020 --> 00:41:46.100]   Which is spoiler for the best episode of "Black Mirror."
[00:41:46.100 --> 00:41:48.300]   But that is all about digital consciousness.
[00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:50.540]   And it's a world that you live in and interact
[00:41:50.540 --> 00:41:51.580]   and have experiences.
[00:41:51.580 --> 00:41:54.340]   So it wouldn't be like being met today.
[00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:55.780]   Hopefully it'll be like,
[00:41:55.780 --> 00:41:58.540]   a actual virtual reality or something that you could jump into.
[00:41:58.540 --> 00:41:59.820]   - Which one was that?
[00:41:59.820 --> 00:42:02.620]   Was that the one where they shrunk the people
[00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:04.380]   and they put them in a little thing?
[00:42:04.380 --> 00:42:05.220]   Or is that--
[00:42:05.220 --> 00:42:06.060]   - No.
[00:42:06.060 --> 00:42:09.260]   - It's where the older folks go under
[00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:10.820]   and get put into this other world.
[00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:14.420]   So it's like the future of elder care in a way.
[00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:15.260]   - I haven't seen that one yet.
[00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:16.100]   I gotta watch that one.
[00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:17.100]   - It's amazing.
[00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:19.420]   I wanna, it's really, really good.
[00:42:19.420 --> 00:42:20.700]   - Something's wrong with Dendra.
[00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:23.500]   I think he poured his brain to the internet
[00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:24.540]   and it didn't work.
[00:42:24.540 --> 00:42:25.780]   - He's coming through.
[00:42:25.780 --> 00:42:28.340]   - The bust out of the television as a--
[00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:29.940]   (laughing)
[00:42:29.940 --> 00:42:32.940]   - Reboot whatever device you're at stored in.
[00:42:32.940 --> 00:42:34.340]   - We let Dendra go first.
[00:42:34.340 --> 00:42:35.780]   (laughing)
[00:42:35.780 --> 00:42:36.980]   - The internet's not ready.
[00:42:36.980 --> 00:42:38.540]   - It would be Max Hedren, wouldn't it be?
[00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:41.460]   - It'd be, Leo, I had,
[00:42:41.460 --> 00:42:42.940]   (mumbling)
[00:42:42.940 --> 00:42:43.980]   that'd be kind of fun.
[00:42:43.980 --> 00:42:44.820]   I wouldn't mind that.
[00:42:44.820 --> 00:42:46.820]   I would, I don't know.
[00:42:46.820 --> 00:42:49.500]   I just, I always thought that would be kind of cool.
[00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:51.700]   We're gonna fix, we're gonna reboot Dendra.
[00:42:51.700 --> 00:42:53.300]   (laughing)
[00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:54.140]   And fix him up.
[00:42:54.140 --> 00:42:54.980]   - Max?
[00:42:54.980 --> 00:42:57.220]   - While we're doing that, let me talk about it.
[00:42:57.220 --> 00:42:59.980]   You know, it's interesting how many of our sponsors
[00:42:59.980 --> 00:43:02.500]   are based upon this kind of basic premise
[00:43:02.500 --> 00:43:04.660]   that the old brick and mortar way of doing things
[00:43:04.660 --> 00:43:06.100]   isn't working and there's a better way.
[00:43:06.100 --> 00:43:07.660]   This is betterment.
[00:43:07.660 --> 00:43:09.580]   You know, I always say this,
[00:43:09.580 --> 00:43:11.940]   why would you go down to the guy who hung a shingle out
[00:43:11.940 --> 00:43:13.140]   on Main Street saying,
[00:43:13.140 --> 00:43:14.500]   I'll help you with your investments?
[00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:17.900]   If he's so good, what's he doing working downtown?
[00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:20.420]   If he's that good, wouldn't he just invest for himself
[00:43:20.420 --> 00:43:21.660]   and be rich?
[00:43:21.660 --> 00:43:22.700]   That isn't the best way.
[00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:25.740]   There is a better way to invest.
[00:43:25.740 --> 00:43:28.500]   It's the largest independent online financial advisor,
[00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:30.120]   but online's the key.
[00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:33.660]   Betterment is designed to help you build wealth
[00:43:33.660 --> 00:43:37.700]   or plan for retirement, maybe save for college,
[00:43:37.700 --> 00:43:39.500]   advance your financial goals.
[00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:42.420]   And they do it because it's automated,
[00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:46.860]   it uses technology to take complex investing strategies
[00:43:46.860 --> 00:43:48.420]   and making them work for you.
[00:43:48.420 --> 00:43:50.380]   Things like, and this wasn't really an issue
[00:43:50.380 --> 00:43:52.100]   till the stock market got pretty volatile.
[00:43:52.100 --> 00:43:53.980]   Things like tax loss harvesting,
[00:43:53.980 --> 00:43:55.420]   which takes advantage of losses
[00:43:55.420 --> 00:43:57.940]   to offset your tax consequences
[00:43:57.940 --> 00:43:59.420]   and thereby make you more money.
[00:43:59.420 --> 00:44:01.740]   It's actually really amazing.
[00:44:01.740 --> 00:44:03.820]   You probably thought you could do this yourself.
[00:44:03.820 --> 00:44:05.100]   I know I did.
[00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:06.580]   When I found out what Betterment's doing,
[00:44:06.580 --> 00:44:08.140]   I realized there is a better way.
[00:44:08.140 --> 00:44:10.180]   Betterment is constantly adjusting,
[00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:13.140]   rebalancing, fine tuning your investment.
[00:44:13.140 --> 00:44:14.740]   Normally if somebody said to you,
[00:44:14.740 --> 00:44:16.860]   well, I'm gonna trade regularly on your behalf,
[00:44:16.860 --> 00:44:18.300]   you'd say, well, yeah, that's gonna cost a lot.
[00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:20.780]   No, no hidden cost at Betterment,
[00:44:20.780 --> 00:44:23.780]   no matter how much money you invest, no matter who you are,
[00:44:23.780 --> 00:44:26.420]   that's the other thing, you don't have to be a millionaire.
[00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:29.700]   It's all for one low transparent management fee.
[00:44:31.340 --> 00:44:32.900]   You still get, if you want humans,
[00:44:32.900 --> 00:44:35.820]   you still get humans, you can still get advice from people,
[00:44:35.820 --> 00:44:37.060]   but they're fiduciaries.
[00:44:37.060 --> 00:44:40.740]   That means they don't invest on their,
[00:44:40.740 --> 00:44:41.900]   they don't have their own products,
[00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:43.060]   they don't invest on their behalf,
[00:44:43.060 --> 00:44:45.140]   they're not incentivized to recommend funds.
[00:44:45.140 --> 00:44:46.780]   Everything they tell you is on,
[00:44:46.780 --> 00:44:49.220]   is for your best interest, not theirs.
[00:44:49.220 --> 00:44:50.460]   That's really important.
[00:44:50.460 --> 00:44:52.420]   I don't care where you get investment advice.
[00:44:52.420 --> 00:44:54.820]   If you don't get that, that's, those are table sticks.
[00:44:54.820 --> 00:44:55.660]   That's the baseline.
[00:44:55.660 --> 00:44:58.940]   You've got to get somebody who's working on your behalf.
[00:44:58.940 --> 00:45:00.620]   You can get personal advice.
[00:45:00.620 --> 00:45:04.340]   It's a wonderful app that'll give you a really good look
[00:45:04.340 --> 00:45:06.500]   at where you stand and what you're doing,
[00:45:06.500 --> 00:45:08.140]   whether you're on track to hit your goals
[00:45:08.140 --> 00:45:10.380]   or get the retirement you want.
[00:45:10.380 --> 00:45:13.060]   You could get guidance and help,
[00:45:13.060 --> 00:45:14.900]   but you also take advantage of their platform.
[00:45:14.900 --> 00:45:16.180]   It's really great.
[00:45:16.180 --> 00:45:18.380]   Investing does involve risk, of course.
[00:45:18.380 --> 00:45:21.660]   I won't lie to you on that,
[00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:25.580]   but if it's done right, you really,
[00:45:25.580 --> 00:45:26.700]   this is the way you need to do it.
[00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:28.820]   And if you're young and you start putting money away now
[00:45:28.820 --> 00:45:30.460]   for your retirement,
[00:45:30.460 --> 00:45:31.820]   you will do great.
[00:45:31.820 --> 00:45:33.420]   You just need to do it now.
[00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:35.420]   Go to betterment.com/twit.
[00:45:35.420 --> 00:45:38.620]   You can get up to one year managed free,
[00:45:38.620 --> 00:45:41.620]   betterment.com/twit.
[00:45:41.620 --> 00:45:44.620]   There is a better way for everything,
[00:45:44.620 --> 00:45:48.820]   including investment, betterment.com/twit.
[00:45:48.820 --> 00:45:50.460]   All right, we got to vendor back.
[00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:53.860]   We rebooted his bottle.
[00:45:53.860 --> 00:45:54.700]   - Huh.
[00:45:54.700 --> 00:45:55.860]   - And this.
[00:45:55.860 --> 00:45:56.700]   - My brain's all right.
[00:45:56.700 --> 00:45:58.260]   - Yeah, that's good.
[00:45:58.260 --> 00:46:01.660]   Actually, here's a philosophical question.
[00:46:01.660 --> 00:46:02.980]   If you took your consciousness
[00:46:02.980 --> 00:46:04.660]   and poured it into some machine,
[00:46:04.660 --> 00:46:07.700]   and it was from the outside world,
[00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:08.980]   it responded just like you.
[00:46:08.980 --> 00:46:11.140]   Just like you had had all your memories.
[00:46:11.140 --> 00:46:13.740]   You would still talk just like you.
[00:46:13.740 --> 00:46:14.580]   But is it you?
[00:46:14.580 --> 00:46:18.700]   - That is, yeah, that's the deeper question.
[00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:21.020]   I say philosophy in college,
[00:46:21.020 --> 00:46:23.340]   and like it is something I feel like
[00:46:23.340 --> 00:46:25.020]   they've been talking about forever.
[00:46:25.020 --> 00:46:27.220]   And it's going to get even more complicated
[00:46:27.220 --> 00:46:30.380]   once all these things actually start happening.
[00:46:30.380 --> 00:46:32.060]   A lot of people think like there's just no way
[00:46:32.060 --> 00:46:33.660]   to capture consciousness, right?
[00:46:33.660 --> 00:46:35.300]   We don't know how that works.
[00:46:35.300 --> 00:46:39.580]   We don't know like how to bottle it up, like you're saying.
[00:46:39.580 --> 00:46:42.700]   So in many ways, like a construction of your consciousness
[00:46:42.700 --> 00:46:44.060]   is just like your memories
[00:46:44.060 --> 00:46:46.380]   and maybe some elements of your personality.
[00:46:46.380 --> 00:46:48.700]   That's certainly not just you.
[00:46:48.700 --> 00:46:50.420]   But I do wonder like, will we ever have the ability
[00:46:50.420 --> 00:46:53.300]   to capture purely what makes us conscious?
[00:46:53.300 --> 00:46:54.620]   Will we ever know what that is?
[00:46:54.620 --> 00:46:55.460]   I don't know.
[00:46:55.460 --> 00:46:58.380]   There's a science fiction story, I remember.
[00:46:58.380 --> 00:46:59.860]   That said every time you teleport,
[00:46:59.860 --> 00:47:00.980]   you're creating a new you.
[00:47:00.980 --> 00:47:02.700]   You're killing. - No, man.
[00:47:02.700 --> 00:47:03.700]   Yeah.
[00:47:03.700 --> 00:47:05.020]   - You're killing yourself.
[00:47:05.020 --> 00:47:06.740]   - Are you talking about the prestige?
[00:47:06.740 --> 00:47:08.380]   - The prestige, that was it.
[00:47:08.380 --> 00:47:11.020]   There was magician who had this great
[00:47:11.020 --> 00:47:13.340]   trans, the Tesla invented for him,
[00:47:13.340 --> 00:47:16.820]   which is a way of transporting himself.
[00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:20.220]   But it always ended up leaving a body, his old person dead.
[00:47:20.220 --> 00:47:21.060]   - Right.
[00:47:21.060 --> 00:47:22.540]   Well, no, he created a way of duplicating himself.
[00:47:22.540 --> 00:47:23.380]   It wasn't transported.
[00:47:23.380 --> 00:47:25.420]   - It was duplicated. - So that was it.
[00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:26.260]   - Yeah.
[00:47:26.260 --> 00:47:28.780]   It's horrifying and amazing movie.
[00:47:28.780 --> 00:47:29.620]   - Yeah, really.
[00:47:29.620 --> 00:47:31.780]   - I think if you upload your consciousness to the internet
[00:47:31.780 --> 00:47:33.540]   and it evolves in any way,
[00:47:33.540 --> 00:47:37.100]   like it changes for better or for worse, then it's you.
[00:47:37.100 --> 00:47:41.700]   I think if it's a static personality, then it's not you.
[00:47:41.700 --> 00:47:42.540]   - Oh, that's a good one. - Oh, yeah.
[00:47:42.540 --> 00:47:44.700]   - So it's both equals consciousness.
[00:47:44.700 --> 00:47:45.580]   - That's good.
[00:47:45.580 --> 00:47:47.940]   - Yeah, or if things get, I mean,
[00:47:47.940 --> 00:47:50.340]   or if you start to go crazy,
[00:47:50.340 --> 00:47:52.540]   which I'm afraid would happen to me
[00:47:52.540 --> 00:47:54.500]   if I uploaded myself to the internet.
[00:47:54.500 --> 00:47:56.620]   - Well, and I think that's also you.
[00:47:56.620 --> 00:47:58.940]   - And it's interesting that as we're getting closer
[00:47:58.940 --> 00:48:02.020]   to this being a reality, we're also learning more and more
[00:48:02.020 --> 00:48:03.940]   how much our biology really is us.
[00:48:03.940 --> 00:48:06.300]   Now we know that the biome,
[00:48:06.300 --> 00:48:10.540]   that several pound blob of bacteria and stuff in your gut
[00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:13.500]   actually determines much of your personality.
[00:48:13.500 --> 00:48:14.340]   - It's pretty helpful.
[00:48:14.340 --> 00:48:15.260]   - Yeah.
[00:48:15.260 --> 00:48:17.220]   - So you're on the edge today, Leo.
[00:48:17.220 --> 00:48:18.060]   I like it.
[00:48:18.060 --> 00:48:19.860]   - Yeah, but it's high in age.
[00:48:19.860 --> 00:48:21.220]   I'm not making it up, right?
[00:48:21.220 --> 00:48:22.580]   That's true. - No, no, no.
[00:48:22.580 --> 00:48:23.420]   - Right?
[00:48:23.420 --> 00:48:25.100]   - And this week in Transhumanism show yet,
[00:48:25.100 --> 00:48:28.100]   because we need that. - Oh, we should.
[00:48:28.100 --> 00:48:29.340]   - We should, don't we?
[00:48:29.340 --> 00:48:31.780]   - Is that what they call that Transhumanism?
[00:48:31.780 --> 00:48:34.660]   - Oh, I mean, yeah, the whole idea of augmenting yourself.
[00:48:34.660 --> 00:48:36.940]   And I think the ultimate goal of like Kurtzwell
[00:48:36.940 --> 00:48:38.580]   and everything is to live forever
[00:48:38.580 --> 00:48:39.780]   as a digital consciousness.
[00:48:39.780 --> 00:48:43.300]   And, you know, it's out there.
[00:48:43.300 --> 00:48:44.500]   It's pretty crazy.
[00:48:44.500 --> 00:48:46.060]   But look at what we're doing.
[00:48:46.060 --> 00:48:48.660]   Like, I think of like when I play MMOs and stuff
[00:48:48.660 --> 00:48:51.020]   and like how much of myself is just purely online
[00:48:51.020 --> 00:48:53.140]   and existing through my avatar.
[00:48:53.140 --> 00:48:55.460]   Yeah, eventually what will be the difference between,
[00:48:55.460 --> 00:48:56.980]   yeah, just purely existing.
[00:48:56.980 --> 00:48:59.940]   - If a lot of your experiences in life are virtual,
[00:48:59.940 --> 00:49:03.020]   those are still experiences.
[00:49:03.020 --> 00:49:04.900]   - For sure.
[00:49:04.900 --> 00:49:07.820]   - You didn't experience them in meat space.
[00:49:07.820 --> 00:49:08.660]   Or did you?
[00:49:08.660 --> 00:49:10.100]   Actually, you did, didn't you?
[00:49:10.100 --> 00:49:12.980]   Because it was just another stimulus to your meat.
[00:49:12.980 --> 00:49:13.820]   - Mm.
[00:49:13.820 --> 00:49:17.860]   - Yeah, there's something you said.
[00:49:17.860 --> 00:49:20.180]   (laughing)
[00:49:20.180 --> 00:49:22.060]   - No crumbs on your mind, keyboard.
[00:49:22.060 --> 00:49:24.340]   (laughing)
[00:49:24.340 --> 00:49:26.260]   I mean, honestly, I don't spend a lot of time
[00:49:26.260 --> 00:49:27.100]   thinking about this.
[00:49:27.100 --> 00:49:29.860]   It's like Elon Musk talking about how this is all a simulation
[00:49:29.860 --> 00:49:31.180]   because it's ultimately circular.
[00:49:31.180 --> 00:49:33.740]   There's no way to really answer it.
[00:49:33.740 --> 00:49:34.580]   It's just, you just--
[00:49:34.580 --> 00:49:35.740]   - It's all speculation. - Right, yeah.
[00:49:35.740 --> 00:49:38.580]   - But there's that guy, Zoltan Isvan, I believe.
[00:49:38.580 --> 00:49:42.500]   Like he is, he's a member of the transhumanist party.
[00:49:42.500 --> 00:49:43.340]   He's in California.
[00:49:43.340 --> 00:49:45.860]   I talked with this guy, a really interesting fellow
[00:49:45.860 --> 00:49:47.980]   and really is all about proportion,
[00:49:48.900 --> 00:49:50.620]   pushing forward the idea of transhumanism
[00:49:50.620 --> 00:49:52.620]   and what that could mean.
[00:49:52.620 --> 00:49:55.100]   There are people who really wanna, you know,
[00:49:55.100 --> 00:49:56.100]   promote this stuff right now.
[00:49:56.100 --> 00:49:57.060]   It's kind of fascinating.
[00:49:57.060 --> 00:49:59.540]   - Don't you feel like Zoltan Isvan's real name
[00:49:59.540 --> 00:50:01.380]   is Herbie Schwartz or something like that?
[00:50:01.380 --> 00:50:03.540]   Like, that's a convenient--
[00:50:03.540 --> 00:50:07.140]   - I'm half convinced he's a superman villain, so.
[00:50:07.140 --> 00:50:07.980]   I don't know.
[00:50:07.980 --> 00:50:11.060]   Like the entire philosophy is basically like,
[00:50:11.060 --> 00:50:14.300]   it does sound like proto-lexiluther or something, yeah.
[00:50:14.300 --> 00:50:16.420]   - You know, Carsten, he does just live down the road
[00:50:16.420 --> 00:50:17.260]   a piece in the valley. - Yeah.
[00:50:17.260 --> 00:50:18.420]   Get him on the plow.
[00:50:18.420 --> 00:50:19.380]   Let's get him up here.
[00:50:19.380 --> 00:50:21.700]   I wanna interview Mr. Istvahn.
[00:50:21.700 --> 00:50:23.940]   That's fascinating.
[00:50:23.940 --> 00:50:27.100]   He's apparently running for a governor.
[00:50:27.100 --> 00:50:27.940]   - Yep.
[00:50:27.940 --> 00:50:29.980]   - California-- - You remind me
[00:50:29.980 --> 00:50:32.540]   of that guy from New Hampshire Boot Head.
[00:50:32.540 --> 00:50:35.180]   Whatever his name is, you know what I'm talking about?
[00:50:35.180 --> 00:50:36.340]   Boot Head. - No.
[00:50:36.340 --> 00:50:38.260]   But that, as somebody from New England,
[00:50:38.260 --> 00:50:39.100]   that makes a complete sense.
[00:50:39.100 --> 00:50:40.540]   - Is he running for governor?
[00:50:40.540 --> 00:50:43.100]   - He's like a, he's from New, I think it's--
[00:50:43.100 --> 00:50:46.500]   - His name is Furman Love Supreme.
[00:50:46.500 --> 00:50:48.260]   - That's the guy.
[00:50:48.260 --> 00:50:50.580]   He's known for wearing a boot as a hat
[00:50:50.580 --> 00:50:53.340]   and carrying a large toothbrush.
[00:50:53.340 --> 00:50:54.940]   - Look at that picture, give that guy.
[00:50:54.940 --> 00:50:58.340]   - He looks like Rasputin, I think Rasputin did not,
[00:50:58.340 --> 00:51:00.940]   in fact, he says if elected president,
[00:51:00.940 --> 00:51:04.220]   he will pass a law requiring people to brush his teeth.
[00:51:04.220 --> 00:51:08.900]   - So take the other guy, maybe skip 15 years
[00:51:08.900 --> 00:51:10.380]   and he's gonna look like this guy.
[00:51:10.380 --> 00:51:13.980]   - I would require everybody to brush my teeth.
[00:51:13.980 --> 00:51:14.820]   - Brush their own teeth.
[00:51:14.820 --> 00:51:16.700]   - Brush, brush, brush your own teeth.
[00:51:16.700 --> 00:51:17.980]   - You know, a little later on,
[00:51:17.980 --> 00:51:19.740]   we've got a toothbrush sponsor on the show,
[00:51:19.740 --> 00:51:23.060]   so I'll bring this back.
[00:51:23.060 --> 00:51:24.820]   He also campaigned on the platform
[00:51:24.820 --> 00:51:28.380]   of zombie apocalypse awareness, time travel research.
[00:51:28.380 --> 00:51:30.060]   And here's, he's got my vote,
[00:51:30.060 --> 00:51:33.060]   he promised a free pony for every American.
[00:51:33.060 --> 00:51:34.460]   - Okay, I'm sold.
[00:51:34.460 --> 00:51:36.780]   - I don't think we have to brush the pony's teeth.
[00:51:36.780 --> 00:51:37.620]   (laughing)
[00:51:37.620 --> 00:51:38.460]   - I take care of it.
[00:51:38.460 --> 00:51:39.980]   - Oh yeah, you don't wanna have, you know,
[00:51:39.980 --> 00:51:42.260]   dental health even for ponies, very important.
[00:51:42.260 --> 00:51:46.660]   Come on, let's get back to tech Leo.
[00:51:46.660 --> 00:51:48.580]   Get your head in the game.
[00:51:48.580 --> 00:51:51.340]   - I don't know, I like where this is.
[00:51:51.340 --> 00:51:53.300]   (laughing)
[00:51:53.300 --> 00:51:55.940]   - Apple has announced publication
[00:51:55.940 --> 00:51:58.860]   along with the car connectivity consortium
[00:51:58.860 --> 00:52:01.620]   of a new digital key specification
[00:52:01.620 --> 00:52:05.820]   that will let you unlock your car with your smartphone.
[00:52:05.820 --> 00:52:12.540]   An open standard so that others can unlock your car
[00:52:12.540 --> 00:52:14.620]   with this smartphone too, I don't know.
[00:52:14.620 --> 00:52:15.740]   What could possibly go wrong?
[00:52:15.740 --> 00:52:16.900]   - Yeah.
[00:52:16.900 --> 00:52:18.100]   - Who needs this?
[00:52:18.100 --> 00:52:19.660]   Nobody needs this.
[00:52:19.660 --> 00:52:21.660]   - Well, I feel if it's more secure
[00:52:21.660 --> 00:52:23.300]   than the current key fob systems.
[00:52:23.300 --> 00:52:24.900]   - Which is highly insecure, right?
[00:52:24.900 --> 00:52:26.540]   - Yeah, the key fobs stink.
[00:52:26.540 --> 00:52:29.460]   So if it's tied to your phone and if it's more secure,
[00:52:29.460 --> 00:52:31.260]   if you could be like, if you could, you know,
[00:52:31.260 --> 00:52:34.380]   give an access to a friend who's borrowing your car
[00:52:34.380 --> 00:52:35.540]   or something, like that sort of thing
[00:52:35.540 --> 00:52:36.540]   could be really cool.
[00:52:36.540 --> 00:52:38.100]   As long as it's more secure, that's the--
[00:52:38.100 --> 00:52:41.300]   - This uses NFC, which means you'd have to touch
[00:52:41.300 --> 00:52:44.180]   an NFC enabled phone to, it's so funny.
[00:52:44.180 --> 00:52:46.540]   'Cause Apple for years, everybody else had NFC.
[00:52:46.540 --> 00:52:49.140]   Apple wouldn't do NFC in their phones for years.
[00:52:49.140 --> 00:52:50.860]   Then they finally did it a couple of years ago
[00:52:50.860 --> 00:52:53.140]   and they still wouldn't let anybody else use it
[00:52:53.140 --> 00:52:54.060]   for a couple of years.
[00:52:54.060 --> 00:52:55.500]   It had to be Apple payer, nothing.
[00:52:55.500 --> 00:52:58.820]   They finally, like this year, announced an SDK for NFC.
[00:52:58.820 --> 00:53:01.740]   Now all of a sudden, oh, NFC is great.
[00:53:01.740 --> 00:53:03.060]   We should use NFC everywhere.
[00:53:03.060 --> 00:53:04.500]   It's like they discovered it.
[00:53:04.500 --> 00:53:05.340]   - Yeah.
[00:53:05.340 --> 00:53:07.100]   I mean, they existed but nobody was using it.
[00:53:07.100 --> 00:53:09.500]   Well, I think that's the Apple key, right?
[00:53:09.500 --> 00:53:11.900]   - All right, give them some credit for that.
[00:53:11.900 --> 00:53:13.940]   Audi, BMW, General Motors, Hyundai,
[00:53:13.940 --> 00:53:17.260]   LG Electronics, Panasonic, Samsung, Volkswagen,
[00:53:17.260 --> 00:53:19.740]   Alps Electric, Continental Automotive,
[00:53:19.740 --> 00:53:22.540]   Denso, Giamalto, NXP and Qualcomm,
[00:53:22.540 --> 00:53:25.260]   all are in the consortium.
[00:53:25.260 --> 00:53:27.660]   It would use NFC, inter--
[00:53:27.660 --> 00:53:32.140]   Oh, come on, interoperable digital key use cases.
[00:53:32.140 --> 00:53:35.340]   It will let drivers lock, unlock,
[00:53:35.340 --> 00:53:37.740]   start the engine and share access to their cars.
[00:53:37.740 --> 00:53:40.300]   This is what you need it for 'cause of car sharing, right?
[00:53:41.300 --> 00:53:42.820]   - Yeah, I just heard they already have that.
[00:53:42.820 --> 00:53:44.540]   They have the card, right?
[00:53:44.540 --> 00:53:46.300]   - The zip card card.
[00:53:46.300 --> 00:53:47.140]   - Oh, yeah, yeah.
[00:53:47.140 --> 00:53:50.260]   - But then these special hardware,
[00:53:50.260 --> 00:53:51.820]   you need the box and stuff for that.
[00:53:51.820 --> 00:53:53.860]   That's the whole thing.
[00:53:53.860 --> 00:53:56.820]   - I hate, I'm on the record for hating this idea.
[00:53:56.820 --> 00:53:58.700]   I think it's a bad idea.
[00:53:58.700 --> 00:53:59.540]   - Car sharing, car sharing.
[00:53:59.540 --> 00:54:01.700]   - I like the idea of being able to use this NFC technology
[00:54:01.700 --> 00:54:04.060]   for all the things.
[00:54:04.060 --> 00:54:07.780]   Right now, Apple, just at WWDC was talking about how
[00:54:07.780 --> 00:54:09.580]   it's working with certain universities,
[00:54:09.580 --> 00:54:11.900]   I believe just in the US right now,
[00:54:11.900 --> 00:54:14.620]   where students can use their Apple Watch
[00:54:14.620 --> 00:54:17.140]   or their iPhone to get into their own building,
[00:54:17.140 --> 00:54:18.940]   to get into the gym, to basically--
[00:54:18.940 --> 00:54:19.780]   - I saw that, yeah.
[00:54:19.780 --> 00:54:20.620]   - They would use their badge.
[00:54:20.620 --> 00:54:21.620]   - That was cool, yeah.
[00:54:21.620 --> 00:54:26.060]   - And I've got a few friends who are in digital effects stuff
[00:54:26.060 --> 00:54:28.220]   for Hollywood and they have to use a badge
[00:54:28.220 --> 00:54:30.540]   to get into the buildings that they work in.
[00:54:30.540 --> 00:54:33.780]   And to be able to tie in with HR programs
[00:54:33.780 --> 00:54:35.660]   and use their Apple Watch or their phone
[00:54:35.660 --> 00:54:37.420]   to get into the building, I think that would be awesome.
[00:54:37.420 --> 00:54:40.660]   And so, yes, if we can make sure that this is more secure
[00:54:40.660 --> 00:54:45.420]   than the less secure fobs, if I have, like, from point A
[00:54:45.420 --> 00:54:47.420]   to point B, all of these different places
[00:54:47.420 --> 00:54:50.060]   where I can use my phone or my Apple Watch,
[00:54:50.060 --> 00:54:53.900]   be it maybe like my front door even, becomes NFC.
[00:54:53.900 --> 00:54:55.540]   My car becomes NFC.
[00:54:55.540 --> 00:55:00.020]   When I go to Starbucks, again, either using Apple Pay
[00:55:00.020 --> 00:55:03.700]   or using the Starbucks card, if I could NFC all the things,
[00:55:03.700 --> 00:55:06.180]   I'm down, I think it'd be great.
[00:55:06.180 --> 00:55:09.180]   - I like it in theory, but I guess my problem is,
[00:55:09.180 --> 00:55:12.380]   like, what is the actual problem it's solving?
[00:55:12.380 --> 00:55:17.700]   And to me, like, I look at how my dad uses his phone
[00:55:17.700 --> 00:55:20.820]   and then I imagine or tries to use his phone
[00:55:20.820 --> 00:55:24.100]   and then I imagine him trying to open a car with that phone.
[00:55:24.100 --> 00:55:26.180]   - Can you come get me a ride?
[00:55:26.180 --> 00:55:28.460]   - I can't get my car going.
[00:55:28.460 --> 00:55:30.260]   - And then I think about law enforcement, right?
[00:55:30.260 --> 00:55:32.300]   Like, I mean, we were talking about this, you know,
[00:55:32.300 --> 00:55:34.340]   I mean, again, not to get too weird about it,
[00:55:34.340 --> 00:55:37.500]   but like, I don't know.
[00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:40.500]   I just don't like the idea of like technology
[00:55:40.500 --> 00:55:43.020]   of unlocking my doors.
[00:55:43.020 --> 00:55:44.260]   I don't know.
[00:55:44.260 --> 00:55:46.220]   - Let me go in the old fashion.
[00:55:46.220 --> 00:55:47.740]   - How about if I'd make it broader than this?
[00:55:47.740 --> 00:55:50.140]   I think the mistake is saying it's a car key.
[00:55:50.140 --> 00:55:52.220]   Really, the issue, there's so many issues.
[00:55:52.220 --> 00:55:54.580]   This solves one issue, but there's a lot of other issues,
[00:55:54.580 --> 00:55:58.180]   which is purely the real problem is authentication.
[00:55:58.180 --> 00:56:00.700]   How do you prove you are you, whether it's to your car
[00:56:00.700 --> 00:56:04.140]   so you could start it or to a company
[00:56:04.140 --> 00:56:06.620]   so you could buy something or to a website
[00:56:06.620 --> 00:56:08.500]   so you can log in?
[00:56:08.500 --> 00:56:09.940]   How do you prove you are you?
[00:56:09.940 --> 00:56:13.540]   And if somebody came along and solved the authentication issue.
[00:56:13.540 --> 00:56:18.540]   And then by doing it digitally allowed it to be like,
[00:56:18.540 --> 00:56:20.620]   what would happen with a car is you'd say,
[00:56:20.620 --> 00:56:25.380]   oh, this person who has a solid, real, genuine authentication
[00:56:25.380 --> 00:56:26.980]   is allowed to drive this car.
[00:56:26.980 --> 00:56:27.820]   - Right.
[00:56:27.820 --> 00:56:30.740]   - But so what they're really solving is authentication.
[00:56:30.740 --> 00:56:31.580]   - Right.
[00:56:31.580 --> 00:56:33.300]   And the phones have the authentication piece, right?
[00:56:33.300 --> 00:56:35.020]   It's your fingerprint, it's your face.
[00:56:35.020 --> 00:56:37.340]   It's the biometric authentication you use
[00:56:37.340 --> 00:56:39.780]   to unlock Apple Pay or whatever.
[00:56:39.780 --> 00:56:42.380]   That is, that would all be tied into this.
[00:56:42.380 --> 00:56:45.540]   - But then Ben's nightmare scenario really is more real
[00:56:45.540 --> 00:56:48.220]   'cause now this phone, it has everything you know
[00:56:48.220 --> 00:56:49.700]   I've done in the last year.
[00:56:49.700 --> 00:56:51.340]   It has my, it's who I am.
[00:56:51.340 --> 00:56:53.340]   It's my identity is in this phone.
[00:56:53.340 --> 00:56:54.180]   - Yeah.
[00:56:54.180 --> 00:56:55.180]   - Yeah, I mean, let's see.
[00:56:55.180 --> 00:56:56.020]   - Let me do it now.
[00:56:56.020 --> 00:56:58.740]   - The driver's license has my identity now.
[00:56:58.740 --> 00:57:00.260]   - All of my stuff's already on my phone
[00:57:00.260 --> 00:57:03.260]   and I trust, you know, like that's the thing is
[00:57:03.260 --> 00:57:05.860]   we are always trading convenience for security
[00:57:05.860 --> 00:57:07.780]   and trying to find the balance between those.
[00:57:07.780 --> 00:57:09.140]   And it's the world in which we live
[00:57:09.140 --> 00:57:12.700]   and we sort of have to either do it or don't do it.
[00:57:12.700 --> 00:57:14.340]   Yoda would know a little bit about that.
[00:57:14.340 --> 00:57:17.580]   And I think that, you know, with my phone,
[00:57:17.580 --> 00:57:20.060]   if I'm worried that a police officer or something
[00:57:20.060 --> 00:57:23.940]   is gonna try to now get into my car using NFC,
[00:57:23.940 --> 00:57:25.180]   I just push these three buttons
[00:57:25.180 --> 00:57:26.700]   and all the things in my pocket or something.
[00:57:26.700 --> 00:57:29.580]   And now they can't access it without having my password.
[00:57:29.580 --> 00:57:30.940]   They can't show it up to my face.
[00:57:30.940 --> 00:57:32.740]   They can't do any of that stuff
[00:57:32.740 --> 00:57:35.100]   because that's a feature that, you know, that Apple has.
[00:57:35.100 --> 00:57:37.860]   - Strong authentication solves that, doesn't it?
[00:57:37.860 --> 00:57:39.380]   - Yeah, I think so.
[00:57:39.380 --> 00:57:41.660]   - And Apple has built in and actually, you know,
[00:57:41.660 --> 00:57:44.060]   on Friday, I interviewed Phil Zimmerman, the creator of PGP.
[00:57:44.060 --> 00:57:45.860]   He was still a crypto guy.
[00:57:45.860 --> 00:57:49.140]   He teaches crypto at the University of Delft and Holland,
[00:57:49.140 --> 00:57:50.940]   but he's also a privacy advocate.
[00:57:50.940 --> 00:57:52.300]   He had interest, I did not know this,
[00:57:52.300 --> 00:57:54.140]   but he got into the whole PGP thing
[00:57:54.140 --> 00:57:56.500]   because he was an anti-Nuka advocate.
[00:57:56.500 --> 00:57:59.780]   And he wanted people to be able to communicate privately
[00:57:59.780 --> 00:58:04.380]   as they fought nukes, not nuclear power plants specifically,
[00:58:04.380 --> 00:58:06.100]   but nuclear weapons.
[00:58:06.100 --> 00:58:10.180]   And, but he's still very much involved in all this.
[00:58:10.180 --> 00:58:12.020]   And I forgot where he was going.
[00:58:12.020 --> 00:58:13.660]   Oh, well, he uses an iPhone.
[00:58:13.660 --> 00:58:17.860]   And he says, it's because of the secure enclave.
[00:58:17.860 --> 00:58:20.820]   He said, and this is the fix to PGP too,
[00:58:20.820 --> 00:58:24.260]   is you need the problem with PGP is your private key
[00:58:24.260 --> 00:58:25.260]   is a vulnerability.
[00:58:25.260 --> 00:58:27.100]   You have to store it on a computer.
[00:58:27.100 --> 00:58:29.460]   It could be stolen, you know, it's past,
[00:58:29.460 --> 00:58:32.140]   praise protected, but that may be not perfect.
[00:58:32.140 --> 00:58:33.980]   What he says is the way to solve this
[00:58:33.980 --> 00:58:36.540]   is hardware based security.
[00:58:36.540 --> 00:58:39.180]   Like, he says it should be in a phone.
[00:58:39.180 --> 00:58:41.100]   Like, he started Silent Circle.
[00:58:41.100 --> 00:58:43.020]   They created the black phone, remember.
[00:58:43.020 --> 00:58:44.780]   - I was about to say, he doesn't use the black phone.
[00:58:44.780 --> 00:58:46.460]   He uses an iPhone, not the black phone.
[00:58:46.460 --> 00:58:48.540]   - Yeah, well, black phone A is out of date,
[00:58:48.540 --> 00:58:50.100]   but he also said, you know, our mistake was
[00:58:50.100 --> 00:58:51.860]   you didn't understand the phone business.
[00:58:51.860 --> 00:58:54.300]   And without carriers, without, you know,
[00:58:54.300 --> 00:58:56.540]   you can't really sell a phone and just say,
[00:58:56.540 --> 00:58:58.660]   good, you have it like a computer.
[00:58:58.660 --> 00:59:01.500]   You have to say, you know, you have to have an infrastructure.
[00:59:01.500 --> 00:59:04.100]   So yeah, and I, he says, there are some Android solutions.
[00:59:04.100 --> 00:59:07.140]   Let's say I'm selling Knox, some hardware enclaves here,
[00:59:07.140 --> 00:59:09.580]   but he really liked how Apple has solved this problem.
[00:59:09.580 --> 00:59:12.260]   So no wonder Apple's in this consortium.
[00:59:12.260 --> 00:59:15.180]   I think it's a mistake to say it's just about car keys.
[00:59:15.180 --> 00:59:17.820]   Let's do now.
[00:59:17.820 --> 00:59:18.820]   Are there political issues?
[00:59:18.820 --> 00:59:20.500]   Is this like a national ID?
[00:59:20.500 --> 00:59:22.220]   Is that, is there a problem there?
[00:59:22.220 --> 00:59:25.100]   - Oh, dear, I hadn't heard that.
[00:59:25.100 --> 00:59:27.140]   Maybe you just sparked that and everyone knows.
[00:59:27.140 --> 00:59:27.980]   - Oh, sorry.
[00:59:27.980 --> 00:59:30.300]   No, nothing like a national ID.
[00:59:30.300 --> 00:59:31.220]   You know why?
[00:59:31.220 --> 00:59:32.100]   Here's the thing.
[00:59:32.100 --> 00:59:34.140]   Oh, I got the solution.
[00:59:34.140 --> 00:59:35.020]   Blockchain.
[00:59:35.020 --> 00:59:36.740]   - Oh my word.
[00:59:36.740 --> 00:59:39.420]   - Here's a million dollars Leo.
[00:59:39.420 --> 00:59:40.740]   - Well, fix it with blockchain.
[00:59:40.740 --> 00:59:42.060]   No, no seriously.
[00:59:42.060 --> 00:59:44.020]   So here's the problem with a national ID.
[00:59:44.020 --> 00:59:45.620]   It's centralized in the US government, right?
[00:59:45.620 --> 00:59:48.260]   Centralization, if you're worried about that,
[00:59:48.260 --> 00:59:50.020]   centralization is the issue.
[00:59:50.020 --> 00:59:52.100]   If we trust the US government today,
[00:59:52.100 --> 00:59:53.660]   but what if you didn't trust them tomorrow,
[00:59:53.660 --> 00:59:56.060]   a national ID system could be used?
[00:59:56.060 --> 00:59:58.620]   Well, we just heard news stories about the border patrol
[00:59:58.620 --> 01:00:01.700]   asking people for IDs as they drove around New England.
[01:00:01.700 --> 01:00:02.700]   Are you a citizen?
[01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:05.220]   It turns out I looked into this
[01:00:05.220 --> 01:00:07.380]   'cause I thought that's weird.
[01:00:07.380 --> 01:00:09.580]   Two thirds of the country is subject to this.
[01:00:09.580 --> 01:00:12.500]   The law says that if you're within 100 miles
[01:00:12.500 --> 01:00:14.340]   of a border or a coast,
[01:00:16.220 --> 01:00:17.900]   that the border patrol can ask you for proof
[01:00:17.900 --> 01:00:19.340]   of your citizen.
[01:00:19.340 --> 01:00:21.860]   Within 100, that means here.
[01:00:21.860 --> 01:00:25.020]   That means pretty much New York City, everybody.
[01:00:25.020 --> 01:00:29.420]   So that's why people are afraid of a national ID, right?
[01:00:29.420 --> 01:00:30.420]   Is this papers?
[01:00:30.420 --> 01:00:33.580]   Please, this whole notion that an adversarial government
[01:00:33.580 --> 01:00:34.700]   would use this against you.
[01:00:34.700 --> 01:00:36.820]   But if it's blockchain, it's decentralized.
[01:00:36.820 --> 01:00:41.380]   So you can have a ledger system that is decentralized,
[01:00:41.380 --> 01:00:44.140]   but secure and strong, that includes identity information.
[01:00:44.140 --> 01:00:45.940]   What about that?
[01:00:45.940 --> 01:00:47.140]   I like it.
[01:00:47.140 --> 01:00:48.740]   Okay, I'm gonna do an ICO.
[01:00:48.740 --> 01:00:50.900]   I can count on you guys.
[01:00:50.900 --> 01:00:51.820]   Sure, that's indeed.
[01:00:51.820 --> 01:00:52.660]   I'm in.
[01:00:52.660 --> 01:00:53.500]   (laughing)
[01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:56.180]   As long as you can still use a code hanger
[01:00:56.180 --> 01:00:58.500]   to unlock the door on the car.
[01:00:58.500 --> 01:01:00.340]   Oh yeah, I'm not gonna put it in the car.
[01:01:00.340 --> 01:01:02.340]   This is more important than the car.
[01:01:02.340 --> 01:01:07.460]   Actually, the cover story in this month's Wired magazine
[01:01:07.460 --> 01:01:12.100]   is all about blockchain and ICOs and crypto.
[01:01:12.100 --> 01:01:13.300]   It is a wild story.
[01:01:13.300 --> 01:01:15.700]   It was long read, but it was kind of an interesting story
[01:01:15.700 --> 01:01:16.700]   if you haven't read it.
[01:01:16.700 --> 01:01:20.660]   Now, let's go on to this issue,
[01:01:20.660 --> 01:01:22.620]   as long as we're, we'll do a couple more Apple stories
[01:01:22.620 --> 01:01:23.460]   and move on.
[01:01:23.460 --> 01:01:29.340]   Supposedly a researcher found a way to unlock iPhones
[01:01:29.340 --> 01:01:31.060]   by streaming passcodes to it.
[01:01:31.060 --> 01:01:34.620]   If you do it fast enough, the iPhone doesn't lock out.
[01:01:34.620 --> 01:01:39.620]   And since a four digit code is only 10,000 different choices
[01:01:39.620 --> 01:01:41.300]   you could brute-face a phone.
[01:01:41.300 --> 01:01:46.100]   Then Renee Ritchie wrote an article, your colleague in mine,
[01:01:46.100 --> 01:01:48.940]   wrote an article that said not so fast Apple says
[01:01:48.940 --> 01:01:52.380]   this actually is a mistake, it's erroneous.
[01:01:52.380 --> 01:01:55.660]   However, what neither Apple nor Renee has mentioned is,
[01:01:55.660 --> 01:01:58.300]   well, in what way is it erroneous?
[01:01:58.300 --> 01:01:59.140]   Right.
[01:01:59.140 --> 01:02:03.500]   So even the original researcher says no hack,
[01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:05.660]   but again, he's not saying in which way it's erroneous.
[01:02:05.660 --> 01:02:08.500]   So I'd like to know more about this.
[01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:09.900]   Me too.
[01:02:09.900 --> 01:02:12.060]   I wish I had more information on this,
[01:02:12.060 --> 01:02:14.020]   'cause yeah, we just got the,
[01:02:14.020 --> 01:02:16.100]   well, the testing was done wrong,
[01:02:16.100 --> 01:02:18.940]   or was the testing was done incorrectly?
[01:02:18.940 --> 01:02:20.660]   I can't remember exactly what it was that Apple said,
[01:02:20.660 --> 01:02:21.660]   the precise statement.
[01:02:21.660 --> 01:02:24.580]   - The guy said it looks like all of the pins
[01:02:24.580 --> 01:02:27.260]   as you stream those out or going to the phone
[01:02:27.260 --> 01:02:30.660]   and being tested, but he said that they aren't always sent
[01:02:30.660 --> 01:02:32.700]   so they don't count.
[01:02:32.700 --> 01:02:35.780]   So you may miss the actual code,
[01:02:35.780 --> 01:02:37.220]   you may go whizzing by it,
[01:02:37.220 --> 01:02:39.660]   and the phone hasn't actually seen it so it won't unlock.
[01:02:39.660 --> 01:02:41.940]   So maybe he got lucky
[01:02:41.940 --> 01:02:44.100]   and the code that he was using worked.
[01:02:44.100 --> 01:02:49.740]   But regardless, there is a very good lesson here,
[01:02:49.740 --> 01:02:51.580]   which is don't use a four digit code.
[01:02:51.580 --> 01:02:52.940]   - Exactly.
[01:02:52.940 --> 01:02:54.980]   - And modern, you should take a link to six.
[01:02:54.980 --> 01:02:56.340]   - Yeah.
[01:02:56.340 --> 01:02:58.900]   - And even this guy says, well, six is so long you can't,
[01:02:58.900 --> 01:03:01.180]   it doesn't work, it's too long.
[01:03:01.180 --> 01:03:03.220]   - Don't they like a Mickey do six now?
[01:03:03.220 --> 01:03:04.660]   - Six is now the standard, yeah.
[01:03:04.660 --> 01:03:06.340]   - Yeah, so.
[01:03:06.340 --> 01:03:08.740]   - I use it, and this is a pain in the butt,
[01:03:08.740 --> 01:03:10.580]   especially 'cause I'm doing it on the iPhone X,
[01:03:10.580 --> 01:03:13.180]   which sometimes doesn't recognize me.
[01:03:13.180 --> 01:03:15.260]   I use like, it's 15, it's a long,
[01:03:15.260 --> 01:03:17.220]   - Yeah, it's really long as well, yeah.
[01:03:17.220 --> 01:03:19.300]   - But that means for some reason,
[01:03:19.300 --> 01:03:21.420]   the iPhone doesn't recognize me when I'm on the pillow
[01:03:21.420 --> 01:03:24.100]   like this, I don't know why I should have done that.
[01:03:24.100 --> 01:03:25.180]   - Now why wouldn't that work?
[01:03:25.180 --> 01:03:26.540]   - Why doesn't that work?
[01:03:26.540 --> 01:03:30.140]   So I'm ending up in the middle of the night having a,
[01:03:30.140 --> 01:03:31.260]   - Where'd Leo go?
[01:03:31.260 --> 01:03:34.820]   - Sometimes, and this drives my wife crazy.
[01:03:34.820 --> 01:03:38.460]   I'll sit up and smile at the phone.
[01:03:38.460 --> 01:03:40.620]   So it unlocks, and then I go back.
[01:03:40.620 --> 01:03:42.580]   - That sounds like a dystopian future, by the way.
[01:03:42.580 --> 01:03:44.340]   Like I want my fingerprint sensor back,
[01:03:44.340 --> 01:03:47.340]   'cause it's just so much easier for those situations.
[01:03:47.340 --> 01:03:48.860]   - Apparently we're gonna be getting
[01:03:48.860 --> 01:03:51.340]   sideways face detection soon.
[01:03:51.340 --> 01:03:52.700]   - Oh, thank God.
[01:03:52.700 --> 01:03:55.740]   - iOS 12 is working on that now, so.
[01:03:55.740 --> 01:03:56.580]   - Are you joking?
[01:03:56.580 --> 01:03:57.460]   - My face is good.
[01:03:57.460 --> 01:03:58.620]   - No, no, I'm not joking.
[01:03:58.620 --> 01:04:02.740]   What they're doing right now is iOS 12 does face detection
[01:04:02.740 --> 01:04:03.580]   from the side.
[01:04:03.580 --> 01:04:04.740]   - What about pillow distortion?
[01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:05.580]   Are they gonna hear me?
[01:04:05.580 --> 01:04:07.100]   - A pillow distortion, see, our phones
[01:04:07.100 --> 01:04:09.700]   don't have object permanence.
[01:04:09.700 --> 01:04:11.780]   So they're sort of like toddlers.
[01:04:11.780 --> 01:04:13.500]   You cover your face and you think it's gone.
[01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:14.340]   - Yeah.
[01:04:14.340 --> 01:04:15.180]   - Yeah.
[01:04:15.180 --> 01:04:16.020]   It's more like the angle thing too,
[01:04:16.020 --> 01:04:17.060]   like when I'm on the bed,
[01:04:17.060 --> 01:04:18.940]   like you get to angle the phone the right way
[01:04:18.940 --> 01:04:21.540]   to kind of get it to recognize them.
[01:04:21.540 --> 01:04:23.660]   - So you all have this experience?
[01:04:23.660 --> 01:04:24.500]   - Yeah.
[01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:25.820]   - Yeah, it's an everybody thing.
[01:04:25.820 --> 01:04:27.380]   - I thought it was just funny.
[01:04:27.380 --> 01:04:29.700]   - Now, Face ID is great when it works,
[01:04:29.700 --> 01:04:31.300]   but it needs, we need them.
[01:04:31.300 --> 01:04:32.420]   We need to get them back.
[01:04:32.420 --> 01:04:34.540]   - Do you sit up and smile?
[01:04:34.540 --> 01:04:35.380]   - Yeah.
[01:04:35.380 --> 01:04:36.580]   - I just wanna turn my face a little bit.
[01:04:36.580 --> 01:04:38.980]   - I don't smile, I just turn my face a little bit.
[01:04:38.980 --> 01:04:40.300]   - It's not just me.
[01:04:40.300 --> 01:04:42.100]   I thought I was a weirdo.
[01:04:42.100 --> 01:04:42.940]   - I wouldn't be a weirdo.
[01:04:42.940 --> 01:04:43.780]   - Well, we're just all weirdo.
[01:04:43.780 --> 01:04:45.300]   - Just all faces.
[01:04:45.300 --> 01:04:46.940]   - I was like, your phone at night.
[01:04:46.940 --> 01:04:48.460]   - You see, you see.
[01:04:48.460 --> 01:04:51.140]   Actually, I do, because of this,
[01:04:51.140 --> 01:04:55.060]   I keep a couple of fingerprint capable phones near the bed.
[01:04:55.060 --> 01:04:56.780]   - Oh my Lord.
[01:04:56.780 --> 01:04:57.620]   - Stupid.
[01:04:57.620 --> 01:04:58.460]   - Oh man.
[01:04:58.460 --> 01:04:59.300]   - Stupid.
[01:04:59.300 --> 01:05:00.140]   This is one of them.
[01:05:00.140 --> 01:05:01.460]   This is, I was mentioning the P20 Pro.
[01:05:01.460 --> 01:05:03.260]   This is the Huawei that you're not supposed to buy
[01:05:03.260 --> 01:05:04.540]   that, you know, the president said.
[01:05:04.540 --> 01:05:06.500]   No, the president isn't like ZTE.
[01:05:06.500 --> 01:05:08.700]   The Commerce Department doesn't like Huawei.
[01:05:08.700 --> 01:05:11.100]   And now I understand why, by the way.
[01:05:11.100 --> 01:05:12.140]   This is an Android device.
[01:05:12.140 --> 01:05:14.380]   Now you tell me what you think of this.
[01:05:14.380 --> 01:05:16.340]   So in the setup, it asks,
[01:05:16.340 --> 01:05:18.620]   before we actually get to the Google login
[01:05:18.620 --> 01:05:20.620]   and the Android stuff, it says,
[01:05:20.620 --> 01:05:22.980]   "Would you like to know local weather?"
[01:05:22.980 --> 01:05:24.380]   And I say, "Yeah."
[01:05:24.380 --> 01:05:28.100]   And it says, "Okay, I need permission to access location,
[01:05:28.100 --> 01:05:30.900]   "the IMEI number and your MAC address."
[01:05:30.900 --> 01:05:35.140]   Really, you need that for local weather?
[01:05:35.140 --> 01:05:35.980]   - Yeah.
[01:05:35.980 --> 01:05:37.260]   - Go on and then there's other
[01:05:37.260 --> 01:05:38.540]   - Really good local weather, Leo.
[01:05:38.540 --> 01:05:39.380]   - Really, yes.
[01:05:39.380 --> 01:05:40.220]   - Hyper-local.
[01:05:40.220 --> 01:05:41.740]   - Hyper-local, yeah.
[01:05:41.740 --> 01:05:43.860]   - Like where you're sitting right now.
[01:05:43.860 --> 01:05:46.340]   So I figure anything I put on this phone
[01:05:46.340 --> 01:05:50.460]   is uniquely identified and sent right back to China, right?
[01:05:50.460 --> 01:05:51.940]   - Must be.
[01:05:51.940 --> 01:05:53.100]   - That's the word.
[01:05:53.100 --> 01:05:55.940]   - Not like it's a safe assumption to make at least.
[01:05:55.940 --> 01:05:58.620]   Better to not, not, not easy.
[01:05:58.620 --> 01:06:01.020]   - I don't want to support the Trump administration's
[01:06:01.020 --> 01:06:03.140]   fear-mongering, but there are certainly like issues, right?
[01:06:03.140 --> 01:06:04.900]   There was also, remember a couple of years ago,
[01:06:04.900 --> 01:06:08.420]   Lenovo computers coming in, we found spyware on them.
[01:06:08.420 --> 01:06:09.420]   And it wasn't Lenovo doing it,
[01:06:09.420 --> 01:06:10.740]   it was just happened in transit.
[01:06:10.740 --> 01:06:13.460]   So there are a lot of things we have to be worried about
[01:06:13.460 --> 01:06:14.460]   when it comes to cybersecurity.
[01:06:14.460 --> 01:06:17.780]   - Well, I also, somebody called the radio show and said,
[01:06:17.780 --> 01:06:20.500]   "Can I get a router that's not made in China?
[01:06:20.500 --> 01:06:23.300]   "My husband is a tin foil hat and will not buy one
[01:06:23.300 --> 01:06:24.700]   "that's not made in China."
[01:06:24.700 --> 01:06:27.460]   And I really, I mean, I don't--
[01:06:27.460 --> 01:06:29.820]   - That was my wife, that was my wife, by the way.
[01:06:29.820 --> 01:06:30.820]   (laughing)
[01:06:30.820 --> 01:06:31.660]   - Of course.
[01:06:31.660 --> 01:06:35.900]   So, can you get anything that's not made in China?
[01:06:35.900 --> 01:06:39.540]   - That's so, that's the worry.
[01:06:39.540 --> 01:06:40.700]   Like even if it's designed here,
[01:06:40.700 --> 01:06:42.220]   it's probably manufactured somewhere.
[01:06:42.220 --> 01:06:44.820]   - I looked at the Euro, it's made in China.
[01:06:44.820 --> 01:06:48.340]   ASUS makes routers and they're a Taiwanese company,
[01:06:48.340 --> 01:06:51.340]   but then I checked and some of their stuff's made in China.
[01:06:51.340 --> 01:06:52.180]   - Yeah.
[01:06:52.180 --> 01:06:55.740]   - I don't, you know, I guess it has to say in the box,
[01:06:55.740 --> 01:06:57.780]   but I don't, I don't, you'd be going to the best bike,
[01:06:57.780 --> 01:06:59.020]   going to, no, not this one.
[01:06:59.020 --> 01:07:00.740]   (laughing)
[01:07:00.740 --> 01:07:02.420]   - I don't know what you do.
[01:07:02.420 --> 01:07:04.860]   So I think you just kind of live with it.
[01:07:04.860 --> 01:07:06.460]   What do we get that, what do we get to do?
[01:07:06.460 --> 01:07:08.180]   - That's why we have security researchers
[01:07:08.180 --> 01:07:10.260]   and I love following all of their paranoia.
[01:07:10.260 --> 01:07:11.100]   - Yeah.
[01:07:11.100 --> 01:07:16.020]   - But so, but what is the real danger?
[01:07:16.020 --> 01:07:19.540]   I mean, whenever we talk about this stuff,
[01:07:19.540 --> 01:07:22.380]   it's like privacy, particularly.
[01:07:22.380 --> 01:07:24.820]   It's like, what is the, I mean,
[01:07:24.820 --> 01:07:26.900]   the insurance company's gonna revoke your insurance
[01:07:26.900 --> 01:07:29.020]   'cause you had a donut on Friday?
[01:07:29.020 --> 01:07:31.540]   - No, what is the real danger?
[01:07:31.540 --> 01:07:34.260]   I understand security, there's some real dangers.
[01:07:34.260 --> 01:07:36.420]   - I think people are worried about like a,
[01:07:36.420 --> 01:07:38.620]   like a hidden attack, a Trojan attack of some kind
[01:07:38.620 --> 01:07:40.900]   that's under attack dude and widely deployed at some point.
[01:07:40.900 --> 01:07:43.300]   - Why do I care if somebody in Beijing
[01:07:43.300 --> 01:07:45.020]   knows everything I do with my friend?
[01:07:45.020 --> 01:07:45.860]   - Right.
[01:07:45.860 --> 01:07:46.700]   - Should I care?
[01:07:46.700 --> 01:07:48.700]   - Oh, so here's the thing.
[01:07:48.700 --> 01:07:51.580]   I think you should, if not for yourself,
[01:07:51.580 --> 01:07:53.780]   I think that caring about this is important
[01:07:53.780 --> 01:07:57.660]   for those of us who have been given this responsibility
[01:07:57.660 --> 01:07:59.940]   in this platform to talk about tech
[01:07:59.940 --> 01:08:01.780]   and talk about the future of tech
[01:08:01.780 --> 01:08:04.820]   and sort of where we are now and where we wanna go.
[01:08:04.820 --> 01:08:08.460]   If we don't advocate for consumer privacy
[01:08:08.460 --> 01:08:12.620]   and consumer protections, then companies don't,
[01:08:12.620 --> 01:08:14.460]   you know, they start to push back on that kind of thing
[01:08:14.460 --> 01:08:16.900]   and they don't pay as much attention to it.
[01:08:16.900 --> 01:08:20.980]   And so while it may not be a big issue for us individually,
[01:08:20.980 --> 01:08:24.660]   and I certainly have in the past had that mindset of like,
[01:08:24.660 --> 01:08:25.860]   what do I care?
[01:08:25.860 --> 01:08:30.860]   But, you know, it's not too difficult to imagine
[01:08:30.860 --> 01:08:32.300]   a bad future.
[01:08:32.300 --> 01:08:34.140]   So a future that we don't wanna live in
[01:08:34.140 --> 01:08:37.460]   where our protection for our privacy then,
[01:08:37.460 --> 01:08:40.300]   that's where people start sort of categorizing people
[01:08:40.300 --> 01:08:44.100]   according to who they are and like,
[01:08:44.100 --> 01:08:48.220]   I mean, any number of possible ways to discriminate
[01:08:48.220 --> 01:08:51.060]   against people could easily be used to the future
[01:08:51.060 --> 01:08:53.980]   in a dystopia based on the fact that we don't have
[01:08:53.980 --> 01:08:56.220]   user protection and privacy protection.
[01:08:56.220 --> 01:08:59.620]   So I just think it's important for us to advocate for that.
[01:08:59.620 --> 01:09:01.940]   - That's definitely like, if we don't care, nobody else will,
[01:09:01.940 --> 01:09:06.940]   but I was thinking right after Trump was elected,
[01:09:06.940 --> 01:09:09.940]   the Brooklyn Library here did something really cool.
[01:09:09.940 --> 01:09:13.860]   They did a 1984 discussion, I think for 84 weeks
[01:09:13.860 --> 01:09:16.900]   for a very, well not, for a very long time,
[01:09:16.900 --> 01:09:18.540]   for like the entire year.
[01:09:18.540 --> 01:09:19.740]   And I did one of those discussions,
[01:09:19.740 --> 01:09:21.660]   I was surprised that people, you know,
[01:09:21.660 --> 01:09:25.020]   this is a small, smart group of people
[01:09:25.020 --> 01:09:27.980]   who didn't hear about any of the metadata collection
[01:09:27.980 --> 01:09:29.180]   that Snowden revealed.
[01:09:29.180 --> 01:09:30.020]   - Really?
[01:09:30.020 --> 01:09:32.500]   - They didn't hear about all this stuff that was happening.
[01:09:32.500 --> 01:09:34.540]   And I was kind of shocked because these are, you know,
[01:09:34.540 --> 01:09:37.020]   these are doctors, these are people who are paying attention
[01:09:37.020 --> 01:09:40.620]   to issues around their civil liberty.
[01:09:40.620 --> 01:09:42.860]   They wanna talk about a book like 1984
[01:09:42.860 --> 01:09:44.660]   and they're not aware of this huge thing
[01:09:44.660 --> 01:09:46.740]   that happened and affects all of them.
[01:09:46.740 --> 01:09:50.460]   So yeah, I think we can't ignore these things for sure.
[01:09:51.460 --> 01:09:53.540]   - It reflects how we live in a bubble.
[01:09:53.540 --> 01:09:54.380]   - Yeah.
[01:09:54.380 --> 01:09:56.860]   - 'Cause we all, this was like top of mind.
[01:09:56.860 --> 01:09:57.700]   - Yeah.
[01:09:57.700 --> 01:10:00.580]   - Well, and I don't know what the,
[01:10:00.580 --> 01:10:03.140]   I don't actually know what the connection is
[01:10:03.140 --> 01:10:07.820]   to the news this week of how people are being separated,
[01:10:07.820 --> 01:10:09.460]   how families are being broken up.
[01:10:09.460 --> 01:10:11.700]   But you look at, I guess what I would say
[01:10:11.700 --> 01:10:12.860]   is you look at stuff like that
[01:10:12.860 --> 01:10:16.260]   that's actually, that is happening right now
[01:10:16.260 --> 01:10:18.260]   and the information around that.
[01:10:18.260 --> 01:10:23.260]   And I think it's not a huge jump to imagine
[01:10:23.260 --> 01:10:26.700]   that you need to protect yourself and your data
[01:10:26.700 --> 01:10:29.140]   considering how things might be used against you
[01:10:29.140 --> 01:10:30.140]   in the future.
[01:10:30.140 --> 01:10:33.540]   I mean, maybe I'm, I guess I'm really,
[01:10:33.540 --> 01:10:36.540]   I'm really taking on the tin foil hat mantle,
[01:10:36.540 --> 01:10:39.460]   but I do think that you look at some of the news
[01:10:39.460 --> 01:10:43.500]   that just, the non-tech news that has been happening
[01:10:43.500 --> 01:10:46.580]   over the last week and over the last months.
[01:10:46.580 --> 01:10:50.580]   And I don't think it's a bad thing,
[01:10:50.580 --> 01:10:54.740]   a bad thing to sort of keep pushing on personal privacy,
[01:10:54.740 --> 01:10:59.540]   personal security protections in the US and elsewhere.
[01:10:59.540 --> 01:11:02.500]   - I think that belief is at most a tin foil headband.
[01:11:02.500 --> 01:11:04.220]   It's certainly not a full tin foil cap.
[01:11:04.220 --> 01:11:07.620]   Like I'm with all Rock the Tin foil headband.
[01:11:07.620 --> 01:11:11.180]   - In the interest of science, I just wanna point out
[01:11:11.180 --> 01:11:13.500]   that people have tested tin foil hats
[01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:17.140]   and they actually conduct radio waves better.
[01:11:17.140 --> 01:11:17.980]   - Oh no.
[01:11:17.980 --> 01:11:18.980]   - They don't protect you.
[01:11:18.980 --> 01:11:20.780]   Just keep that in mind.
[01:11:20.780 --> 01:11:23.020]   - The Ferriti Cage, the Ferriti Cage headband.
[01:11:23.020 --> 01:11:23.860]   - Yes, yes.
[01:11:23.860 --> 01:11:25.380]   - What you need is a copper mesh.
[01:11:25.380 --> 01:11:26.740]   - Head cage, yeah.
[01:11:26.740 --> 01:11:29.300]   - Yeah, maybe that's why the guy wears a boot on his head.
[01:11:29.300 --> 01:11:30.140]   Who knows?
[01:11:30.140 --> 01:11:31.780]   - What does he know?
[01:11:31.780 --> 01:11:33.580]   - What does he know?
[01:11:33.580 --> 01:11:35.620]   - No, I understand what you're saying.
[01:11:35.620 --> 01:11:40.420]   And I look at China too and see how privacy
[01:11:40.420 --> 01:11:42.940]   and they're using face recognition
[01:11:42.940 --> 01:11:45.300]   in much more aggressive ways in China.
[01:11:45.300 --> 01:11:47.020]   They've got a social contract system
[01:11:47.020 --> 01:11:50.180]   that does actually look like black mirror.
[01:11:50.180 --> 01:11:52.860]   So you see countries and Russia
[01:11:52.860 --> 01:11:57.180]   to authoritarian countries acting against their citizens
[01:11:57.180 --> 01:11:58.860]   by invading privacy.
[01:11:58.860 --> 01:12:04.020]   I'm not sure who I'm more afraid of as Facebook and Google
[01:12:04.020 --> 01:12:05.100]   get more powerful.
[01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:06.500]   Are they more to be feared?
[01:12:06.500 --> 01:12:09.940]   I mean, they don't have tanks and nuclear weapons,
[01:12:09.940 --> 01:12:12.860]   but at the same time, they know more about me than anybody.
[01:12:12.860 --> 01:12:14.780]   I don't know if I fear government more
[01:12:14.780 --> 01:12:17.180]   than I do feel a private industry,
[01:12:17.180 --> 01:12:22.020]   but it is clear it's something we should pay attention to.
[01:12:22.020 --> 01:12:22.860]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:12:22.860 --> 01:12:25.620]   - That stuff is, and a lot of it comes back
[01:12:25.620 --> 01:12:29.460]   to this smartphone and how much we're storing in there
[01:12:29.460 --> 01:12:31.460]   and carrying around in our pocket
[01:12:31.460 --> 01:12:33.220]   something that is always online,
[01:12:33.220 --> 01:12:37.460]   has GPS, microphone, camera.
[01:12:37.460 --> 01:12:38.780]   This is the perfect spy device
[01:12:38.780 --> 01:12:41.260]   and we all carry them all the time.
[01:12:41.260 --> 01:12:42.100]   - Yeah.
[01:12:42.100 --> 01:12:46.100]   So if it's not that I don't think there's a real risk right now,
[01:12:46.100 --> 01:12:50.940]   but if it were to go, "Oh, go south."
[01:12:50.940 --> 01:12:54.900]   This could be really used against us, right?
[01:12:54.900 --> 01:12:55.940]   - Absolutely.
[01:12:55.940 --> 01:12:58.700]   And there was a recent story,
[01:12:58.700 --> 01:13:01.820]   or someone was making a joke about dominoes.
[01:13:01.820 --> 01:13:04.140]   They have this new thing where you can go online
[01:13:04.140 --> 01:13:09.220]   and apply to have your potholes filled by the company.
[01:13:09.220 --> 01:13:10.500]   So the company is going around
[01:13:10.500 --> 01:13:12.420]   and filling potholes in certain cities.
[01:13:12.420 --> 01:13:13.500]   And the whole joke is like,
[01:13:13.500 --> 01:13:15.700]   "We wanna get the pizza delivered to you
[01:13:15.700 --> 01:13:17.860]   "and everything's gonna get there smoothly
[01:13:17.860 --> 01:13:19.420]   "because there won't be potholes."
[01:13:19.420 --> 01:13:20.940]   - I saw that ad.
[01:13:20.940 --> 01:13:22.380]   - Are they actually doing that?
[01:13:22.380 --> 01:13:23.300]   - Yeah, that's a real thing.
[01:13:23.300 --> 01:13:26.380]   They're giving grants to cities to be able to pay for those.
[01:13:26.380 --> 01:13:29.300]   - Do they put dominoes on the pothole?
[01:13:29.300 --> 01:13:30.460]   - No, they're not.
[01:13:30.460 --> 01:13:31.300]   - They do?
[01:13:31.300 --> 01:13:33.420]   - You see, somebody said the audience is telling me,
[01:13:33.420 --> 01:13:35.260]   "Do they do it in Georgia?"
[01:13:35.260 --> 01:13:36.340]   - Oh, maybe it is on the pothole.
[01:13:36.340 --> 01:13:37.180]   Okay.
[01:13:37.180 --> 01:13:39.500]   - They stencil a domino on the thing.
[01:13:39.500 --> 01:13:40.980]   - Oh, wow, I didn't know what that was.
[01:13:40.980 --> 01:13:41.820]   - This was big on red.
[01:13:41.820 --> 01:13:42.660]   - This was big on red.
[01:13:42.660 --> 01:13:44.100]   - That is freaking great marketing.
[01:13:44.100 --> 01:13:45.300]   'Cause honestly,
[01:13:45.300 --> 01:13:48.060]   how many times have you lost a pizza to a pothole, really?
[01:13:48.060 --> 01:13:51.140]   - But here's the thing, we see that now,
[01:13:51.140 --> 01:13:53.340]   how long until-- - Great pothole prices.
[01:13:53.340 --> 01:13:55.300]   - Long John Silver's is going,
[01:13:55.300 --> 01:13:58.660]   "Okay, maybe you want us to hold your traffic courts for you?
[01:13:58.660 --> 01:13:59.820]   "Like, we'll take care of that."
[01:13:59.820 --> 01:14:01.620]   - Got nothing wrong with that.
[01:14:01.620 --> 01:14:03.820]   - This is some idiosyncrasy future here
[01:14:03.820 --> 01:14:05.460]   where the brands control everything.
[01:14:05.460 --> 01:14:06.460]   - Yeah.
[01:14:06.460 --> 01:14:08.860]   - And they start spraying Gatorade on the fields
[01:14:08.860 --> 01:14:10.900]   'cause it's got vitamins.
[01:14:10.900 --> 01:14:13.300]   - It's got electrolytes, it's got electrolytes.
[01:14:13.300 --> 01:14:14.940]   - They use our face tracking data then
[01:14:14.940 --> 01:14:16.500]   to better market to us.
[01:14:16.500 --> 01:14:19.060]   I mean, it's just like all of these horrible futures
[01:14:19.060 --> 01:14:23.420]   that we can imagine in which our privacy is so important
[01:14:23.420 --> 01:14:25.460]   that we have that stuff now and locked in
[01:14:25.460 --> 01:14:27.220]   before we get to the future where,
[01:14:27.220 --> 01:14:28.300]   I mean, we're already there, apparently.
[01:14:28.300 --> 01:14:29.700]   I didn't realize they were stenciling
[01:14:29.700 --> 01:14:31.780]   dumb, no slow-coose onto the pothole.
[01:14:31.780 --> 01:14:33.420]   - I actually don't, I mean,
[01:14:33.420 --> 01:14:38.060]   we live in the pothole capital of the world, Petaluma.
[01:14:38.060 --> 01:14:39.220]   I think this is a good thing.
[01:14:39.220 --> 01:14:41.260]   What's wrong with Domino's fixin' it?
[01:14:41.260 --> 01:14:42.940]   - Nothing now.
[01:14:42.940 --> 01:14:45.740]   I'm talking about a future in which we rely instead
[01:14:45.740 --> 01:14:48.020]   of on our government and the sales tax
[01:14:48.020 --> 01:14:49.740]   that we're charging Amazon for,
[01:14:49.740 --> 01:14:52.980]   we rely on these restaurants and brands
[01:14:52.980 --> 01:14:54.500]   to take care of things for us.
[01:14:54.500 --> 01:14:55.980]   - Steyer Shrek, maybe Chatterum says,
[01:14:55.980 --> 01:14:57.260]   "Actually, it's fitting 'cause their piece
[01:14:57.260 --> 01:14:58.740]   "it tastes like asphalt."
[01:14:58.740 --> 01:14:59.580]   - Ooh.
[01:14:59.580 --> 01:15:00.420]   - Oh, wow.
[01:15:00.420 --> 01:15:01.900]   (laughing)
[01:15:01.900 --> 01:15:02.740]   - They didn't admit their piece
[01:15:02.740 --> 01:15:03.980]   it didn't taste good.
[01:15:03.980 --> 01:15:04.820]   - What?
[01:15:04.820 --> 01:15:05.660]   - Like, that's a further marketing campaign
[01:15:05.660 --> 01:15:06.500]   a couple of years ago.
[01:15:06.500 --> 01:15:07.780]   It's like, "Oh yeah, we're sorry."
[01:15:07.780 --> 01:15:11.380]   - It's not great pizza, but it's fast.
[01:15:11.380 --> 01:15:13.220]   - Look, the one of the only ones that offer
[01:15:13.220 --> 01:15:16.660]   a gluten-free pizza that doesn't taste terrible.
[01:15:16.660 --> 01:15:19.140]   And so I have love in my heart for none of those.
[01:15:19.140 --> 01:15:21.260]   - I can't eat some gluten for Christ's sake.
[01:15:21.260 --> 01:15:22.780]   You look like a stick.
[01:15:22.780 --> 01:15:24.780]   (laughing)
[01:15:24.780 --> 01:15:26.500]   - That's why.
[01:15:26.500 --> 01:15:27.740]   - What happens when you include,
[01:15:27.740 --> 01:15:29.420]   and you get gassy, what really serious?
[01:15:29.420 --> 01:15:32.660]   - No, so what it does is it cause, okay, here we go.
[01:15:32.660 --> 01:15:35.380]   It causes your digestive system
[01:15:35.380 --> 01:15:37.180]   to actually flare up internally.
[01:15:37.180 --> 01:15:38.980]   So you actually become worse at being able
[01:15:38.980 --> 01:15:41.140]   to get nutrients into your body.
[01:15:41.140 --> 01:15:43.100]   - So everybody, or just you?
[01:15:43.100 --> 01:15:45.260]   - No, no, well, anyone who has a gluten intolerance
[01:15:45.260 --> 01:15:46.940]   or has full on celiac, yeah.
[01:15:46.940 --> 01:15:49.460]   - Celiac, I know, 'cause I have friends with celiac.
[01:15:49.460 --> 01:15:50.540]   That's terrible, yeah.
[01:15:50.540 --> 01:15:52.020]   - Yeah, mine is not as severe as that.
[01:15:52.020 --> 01:15:53.220]   I just have a gluten intolerant.
[01:15:53.220 --> 01:15:55.620]   So it's now that I don't eat gluten,
[01:15:55.620 --> 01:15:56.900]   I can get nutrients better.
[01:15:56.900 --> 01:15:59.340]   So I'm perhaps not being as scrawn.
[01:15:59.340 --> 01:16:01.580]   - My problem is not getting,
[01:16:01.580 --> 01:16:05.660]   my problem is not lack of getting nutrients.
[01:16:05.660 --> 01:16:08.260]   In fact, maybe I should eat more gluten, I'm thinking.
[01:16:08.260 --> 01:16:10.220]   (laughing)
[01:16:10.220 --> 01:16:11.740]   - Try to get yourself a gluten tolerance.
[01:16:11.740 --> 01:16:13.820]   - Yeah, it's like a weight loss strategy.
[01:16:13.820 --> 01:16:14.660]   - There you go.
[01:16:14.660 --> 01:16:16.420]   - I'm gonna eat nothing but gluten.
[01:16:16.420 --> 01:16:17.260]   - See what happens.
[01:16:17.260 --> 01:16:18.460]   - I mean, it's like the better coffee thing.
[01:16:18.460 --> 01:16:19.860]   Like there's always, there's gonna,
[01:16:19.860 --> 01:16:21.940]   people gonna make a diet out of every dumb idea
[01:16:21.940 --> 01:16:22.780]   at this point.
[01:16:22.780 --> 01:16:23.620]   - I know.
[01:16:23.620 --> 01:16:24.460]   Hey, let's take a little break.
[01:16:24.460 --> 01:16:25.300]   This is fun.
[01:16:25.300 --> 01:16:26.140]   I don't know why I'm in a mood,
[01:16:26.140 --> 01:16:28.500]   but I'm glad you guys are here to share it with me.
[01:16:28.500 --> 01:16:30.580]   Maybe it's 'cause you're so good looking.
[01:16:30.580 --> 01:16:35.540]   Ben Brock Johnson is here from WBAUR.
[01:16:35.540 --> 01:16:36.580]   He's a senior producer there.
[01:16:36.580 --> 01:16:38.980]   You may remember him from the Code Breakers podcast
[01:16:38.980 --> 01:16:41.420]   and of course he was on Marketplace for a long time
[01:16:41.420 --> 01:16:43.500]   and right Marketplace.
[01:16:43.500 --> 01:16:44.340]   - Yes, sir.
[01:16:44.340 --> 01:16:45.180]   - I forgot.
[01:16:45.180 --> 01:16:46.860]   - I was close to all you were talking about
[01:16:46.860 --> 01:16:49.020]   at G-PY the little while ago.
[01:16:49.020 --> 01:16:50.340]   - I forgot that that's-
[01:16:50.340 --> 01:16:52.220]   - Was it Kaya interviewed him?
[01:16:52.220 --> 01:16:53.420]   Kaya's great.
[01:16:53.420 --> 01:16:54.780]   And Molly Wood works there now.
[01:16:54.780 --> 01:16:56.260]   We love Molly.
[01:16:56.260 --> 01:16:57.260]   Is she still there?
[01:16:57.260 --> 01:16:59.780]   - I think so.
[01:16:59.780 --> 01:17:01.020]   - You guys did have a long time.
[01:17:01.020 --> 01:17:02.060]   - Yeah, it's been a while.
[01:17:02.060 --> 01:17:04.900]   At the Brock Johnson on the Twitter,
[01:17:04.900 --> 01:17:06.420]   thank you, great to have you, Ben.
[01:17:06.420 --> 01:17:07.980]   Also here with Devindra Hardawar,
[01:17:07.980 --> 01:17:11.860]   senior editor at Engadget and a snappy-ass dresser.
[01:17:11.860 --> 01:17:15.780]   From beautiful downtown Brooklyn.
[01:17:15.780 --> 01:17:17.420]   - Not downtown Brooklyn.
[01:17:17.420 --> 01:17:18.660]   - Is there a downtown?
[01:17:18.660 --> 01:17:19.980]   - Is there a downtown?
[01:17:19.980 --> 01:17:20.860]   - There is a downtown.
[01:17:20.860 --> 01:17:23.820]   It's gotten a lot better recently too.
[01:17:23.820 --> 01:17:25.060]   Well, more livable.
[01:17:25.060 --> 01:17:27.060]   I'd say they put up all these crazy skyscrapers
[01:17:27.060 --> 01:17:28.060]   and that's controversial,
[01:17:28.060 --> 01:17:29.700]   but there's an Elmo draft house there.
[01:17:29.700 --> 01:17:30.900]   There's a lot of cool stuff.
[01:17:30.900 --> 01:17:33.300]   - Anywhere there's an Elmo draft house I want to live.
[01:17:33.300 --> 01:17:34.700]   I love Elmo draft house.
[01:17:34.700 --> 01:17:36.860]   - I'm 15 minutes from it on the subway
[01:17:36.860 --> 01:17:38.020]   and I love it so much.
[01:17:38.020 --> 01:17:42.860]   - You go to the movies, but they feed you tacos.
[01:17:42.860 --> 01:17:44.180]   - Mm, or whatever.
[01:17:44.180 --> 01:17:45.420]   - Or whatever.
[01:17:45.420 --> 01:17:48.060]   That's the one in Austin, I'd probably in Brooklyn.
[01:17:48.060 --> 01:17:49.060]   - I mean, yeah, they have,
[01:17:49.060 --> 01:17:50.740]   I think every location has a different menu,
[01:17:50.740 --> 01:17:52.300]   but yeah, they have a nice selection.
[01:17:52.300 --> 01:17:53.700]   I don't do it for everything,
[01:17:53.700 --> 01:17:56.020]   'cause I do think that adds up so much.
[01:17:56.020 --> 01:17:57.660]   - Yeah, there's a lot of gluten.
[01:17:57.660 --> 01:17:58.820]   - A lot of gluten.
[01:17:58.820 --> 01:18:01.260]   Your movie nights get expensive when you go there.
[01:18:01.260 --> 01:18:03.420]   - In Brooklyn, they feed you artisanal cheese
[01:18:03.420 --> 01:18:07.060]   and fig jelly or something, I don't know.
[01:18:07.060 --> 01:18:09.500]   Also with us great to have Micah Sargent,
[01:18:09.500 --> 01:18:11.540]   senior editor for Mobile Nations,
[01:18:11.540 --> 01:18:14.020]   M-I-K-A-H-S-A-R-G-E-S-G.
[01:18:14.020 --> 01:18:15.340]   - That's me.
[01:18:15.340 --> 01:18:16.180]   - On the Twitter.
[01:18:16.180 --> 01:18:19.140]   - Wait, was Davinjur talking about Alamo?
[01:18:19.140 --> 01:18:19.980]   - Yeah.
[01:18:19.980 --> 01:18:22.220]   - Okay, now I'm locating myself,
[01:18:22.220 --> 01:18:24.140]   but I have an Alamo in the town.
[01:18:24.140 --> 01:18:24.980]   - No you don't.
[01:18:24.980 --> 01:18:28.180]   You do not have an Alamo draft house, the movie theater?
[01:18:28.180 --> 01:18:29.780]   - Yes, Alamo draft house, yes.
[01:18:29.780 --> 01:18:31.620]   - Now you're fine.
[01:18:31.620 --> 01:18:32.460]   - You don't believe me.
[01:18:32.460 --> 01:18:33.940]   - You move into wherever the hell it is
[01:18:33.940 --> 01:18:35.340]   if I could ever find out.
[01:18:35.340 --> 01:18:36.980]   - Springfield, Springfield, Missouri.
[01:18:36.980 --> 01:18:37.820]   - Oh it's famous.
[01:18:37.820 --> 01:18:38.660]   - It's got an Alamo draft house here.
[01:18:38.660 --> 01:18:40.380]   - Famous, that's where the Simpsons live.
[01:18:40.380 --> 01:18:41.340]   - No, they're like,
[01:18:41.340 --> 01:18:42.180]   - We don't know where they live.
[01:18:42.180 --> 01:18:43.020]   - There's like a mixture.
[01:18:43.020 --> 01:18:44.340]   It's like, could be Springfield, Illinois,
[01:18:44.340 --> 01:18:45.500]   could be Springfield, Missouri.
[01:18:45.500 --> 01:18:46.980]   - Can you have an Alamo draft house?
[01:18:46.980 --> 01:18:47.820]   - Yeah.
[01:18:47.820 --> 01:18:49.700]   - Ben, is there an Alamo draft house in Boston?
[01:18:49.700 --> 01:18:52.580]   - I wish.
[01:18:52.580 --> 01:18:55.300]   Well actually, maybe there is, I don't know of one.
[01:18:55.300 --> 01:18:57.100]   - There's one in San Francisco now.
[01:18:57.100 --> 01:19:00.060]   - I left Brooklyn recently enough that I was going
[01:19:00.060 --> 01:19:02.220]   to the one that Indres is close to.
[01:19:02.220 --> 01:19:04.100]   But man, every time I went there,
[01:19:04.100 --> 01:19:05.260]   almost every time I went there,
[01:19:05.260 --> 01:19:06.660]   I got in a few times,
[01:19:06.660 --> 01:19:08.100]   it's like always sold out.
[01:19:08.100 --> 01:19:08.940]   That's the thing.
[01:19:08.940 --> 01:19:09.780]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:19:09.780 --> 01:19:10.620]   - It's tough.
[01:19:10.620 --> 01:19:12.580]   - I saw a really bad movie in Austin there,
[01:19:12.580 --> 01:19:13.420]   burn after reading,
[01:19:13.420 --> 01:19:15.340]   but I enjoyed the beer and tacos.
[01:19:15.340 --> 01:19:16.420]   (laughing)
[01:19:16.420 --> 01:19:18.780]   - You know that movie, watch that movie again.
[01:19:18.780 --> 01:19:20.020]   It is more precious. - It's grown up,
[01:19:20.020 --> 01:19:21.100]   - than you think.
[01:19:21.100 --> 01:19:23.540]   Yeah, it's not a great Cohen movie, but it's hard.
[01:19:23.540 --> 01:19:24.820]   - All I remember is George Clooney
[01:19:24.820 --> 01:19:27.540]   carrying a sex pillow around for, yeah.
[01:19:27.540 --> 01:19:28.900]   - And Brad Pitt is like an idiot.
[01:19:28.900 --> 01:19:30.820]   - Wait, is that the one with the chair?
[01:19:30.820 --> 01:19:31.940]   - Yes. - Okay.
[01:19:31.940 --> 01:19:33.140]   - Yeah, that one.
[01:19:33.140 --> 01:19:34.220]   (laughing)
[01:19:34.220 --> 01:19:36.220]   - And Francis McDormand's in it too, right?
[01:19:36.220 --> 01:19:37.060]   - Mm-hmm, yeah.
[01:19:37.060 --> 01:19:37.900]   - Yeah.
[01:19:37.900 --> 01:19:38.740]   - What a flick.
[01:19:38.740 --> 01:19:40.620]   - Who's the gym owner, the dumb gym owner?
[01:19:40.620 --> 01:19:41.460]   Is that Brad Pitt?
[01:19:41.460 --> 01:19:42.300]   - Brad Pitt, yeah.
[01:19:42.300 --> 01:19:43.140]   - Yeah.
[01:19:43.140 --> 01:19:43.980]   - Brad Pitt, yeah.
[01:19:43.980 --> 01:19:44.820]   - No?
[01:19:44.820 --> 01:19:45.660]   - Yeah.
[01:19:45.660 --> 01:19:46.500]   - Oh, it's not Brad Pitt?
[01:19:46.500 --> 01:19:47.340]   - Not owner, he works at the gym.
[01:19:47.340 --> 01:19:48.180]   - He works at the gym.
[01:19:48.180 --> 01:19:49.020]   - Yeah.
[01:19:49.020 --> 01:19:49.860]   - John's a stickler for accuracy.
[01:19:49.860 --> 01:19:51.220]   (laughing)
[01:19:51.220 --> 01:19:54.620]   I showed today, brought to you by Eero.
[01:19:54.620 --> 01:19:57.100]   Eero's a hero as far as I'm concerned.
[01:19:57.100 --> 01:19:58.660]   About two years ago,
[01:19:59.860 --> 01:20:02.500]   they decided to fix wifi.
[01:20:02.500 --> 01:20:04.860]   And now they've done it for so many people.
[01:20:04.860 --> 01:20:07.940]   The advantage of Eero being around for two years
[01:20:07.940 --> 01:20:09.180]   and so many people using it is,
[01:20:09.180 --> 01:20:10.620]   it gets better all the time.
[01:20:10.620 --> 01:20:13.020]   They learn and they get better
[01:20:13.020 --> 01:20:14.500]   and it's upgraded all the time.
[01:20:14.500 --> 01:20:16.820]   Firmware upgrades, you don't ever have to worry
[01:20:16.820 --> 01:20:20.540]   about things like VPN filter and festing your Eero
[01:20:20.540 --> 01:20:23.020]   because they do firmware upgrades all the time.
[01:20:23.020 --> 01:20:24.300]   They were never vulnerable.
[01:20:24.300 --> 01:20:26.340]   And you know, really wifi used to be good,
[01:20:26.340 --> 01:20:28.500]   but then we put about 100 different devices
[01:20:28.500 --> 01:20:29.580]   on our wifi network.
[01:20:29.580 --> 01:20:33.540]   My Eero says I have 42 devices running on my Eero.
[01:20:33.540 --> 01:20:35.860]   And suddenly, and then your neighbors have wifi
[01:20:35.860 --> 01:20:37.620]   and pretty soon it stops working.
[01:20:37.620 --> 01:20:39.220]   Eero solves that.
[01:20:39.220 --> 01:20:40.660]   They solve that.
[01:20:40.660 --> 01:20:43.060]   The second generation Eero and the Eero beacon,
[01:20:43.060 --> 01:20:44.500]   that's what I've got here.
[01:20:44.500 --> 01:20:46.340]   Allow a customer to build a wifi system
[01:20:46.340 --> 01:20:48.300]   that's more perfectly tailored to their home
[01:20:48.300 --> 01:20:49.140]   than ever before.
[01:20:49.140 --> 01:20:51.660]   They offer more speed, more range,
[01:20:51.660 --> 01:20:53.100]   still though the same, look at that.
[01:20:53.100 --> 01:20:56.300]   A high quality, elegant design people have come to expect.
[01:20:56.300 --> 01:20:58.980]   The second generation Eero is now Tri-Band.
[01:20:58.980 --> 01:21:01.260]   They have a third five gigahertz radio.
[01:21:01.260 --> 01:21:04.340]   So they use one of the radios for a back haul,
[01:21:04.340 --> 01:21:05.900]   but it doesn't slow down your internet
[01:21:05.900 --> 01:21:09.140]   like an extender will because they have full duplex
[01:21:09.140 --> 01:21:11.140]   on the rest of the channels.
[01:21:11.140 --> 01:21:12.660]   It's twice as fast.
[01:21:12.660 --> 01:21:14.580]   You can do more in every room of your house.
[01:21:14.580 --> 01:21:15.740]   You know what I like about the beacon?
[01:21:15.740 --> 01:21:16.820]   It's also a night light.
[01:21:16.820 --> 01:21:18.260]   It's got a little night light underneath it.
[01:21:18.260 --> 01:21:20.300]   So I put these in the hall
[01:21:20.300 --> 01:21:22.900]   where they can spread wifi best and they light up the hall,
[01:21:22.900 --> 01:21:23.740]   which is cool.
[01:21:23.740 --> 01:21:24.700]   You could turn off that light if you want.
[01:21:24.700 --> 01:21:25.540]   I have one in the bedroom.
[01:21:25.540 --> 01:21:26.380]   I turn off.
[01:21:26.380 --> 01:21:28.300]   I actually have five Eero's all over the house.
[01:21:28.300 --> 01:21:29.140]   I love it.
[01:21:29.140 --> 01:21:30.580]   They have now thread radio,
[01:21:30.580 --> 01:21:32.460]   which means you can connect low power devices
[01:21:32.460 --> 01:21:34.460]   like lock store bells, other sensors and more.
[01:21:34.460 --> 01:21:35.620]   They're always adding new features.
[01:21:35.620 --> 01:21:37.180]   You know, the other day I said,
[01:21:37.180 --> 01:21:39.100]   "Oh, I could turn on IPv6."
[01:21:39.100 --> 01:21:40.500]   So I did.
[01:21:40.500 --> 01:21:43.220]   Expanding coverage in any room is easy with an Eero beacon.
[01:21:43.220 --> 01:21:45.260]   You plug it into the wall and you're covered.
[01:21:45.260 --> 01:21:48.140]   If there's an outlet, you can have wifi.
[01:21:48.140 --> 01:21:50.700]   I love R Eros.
[01:21:50.700 --> 01:21:52.420]   In fact, I like it so much.
[01:21:52.420 --> 01:21:54.780]   I got the new system and gave my mom the old one.
[01:21:54.780 --> 01:21:56.580]   So mom's got an Eero too.
[01:21:56.580 --> 01:21:57.540]   And you know what's neat is
[01:21:57.540 --> 01:21:59.500]   I can check on mom's network.
[01:21:59.500 --> 01:22:01.980]   So when mom says, "Hey, my internet's down,"
[01:22:01.980 --> 01:22:03.500]   I literally can open the Eero app,
[01:22:03.500 --> 01:22:06.340]   switch over to her network and see what's going on.
[01:22:06.340 --> 01:22:08.100]   Oh, mom, yeah, it must have kicked the one loose
[01:22:08.100 --> 01:22:10.220]   in the kitchen and she can fix it.
[01:22:10.220 --> 01:22:11.380]   Let's switch over to my network.
[01:22:11.380 --> 01:22:15.100]   I think there's a few more devices on my network at home.
[01:22:15.100 --> 01:22:19.700]   35 connected devices and there'll be more when we get home.
[01:22:19.700 --> 01:22:21.740]   E E R O dot com.
[01:22:21.740 --> 01:22:25.220]   If you want free overnight shipping to the US or Canada,
[01:22:25.220 --> 01:22:27.220]   go there and when you buy it,
[01:22:27.220 --> 01:22:28.220]   select overnight shipping,
[01:22:28.220 --> 01:22:30.660]   then use the offer code to it and it'll be free.
[01:22:30.660 --> 01:22:32.740]   Life's too short for bad wifi.
[01:22:32.740 --> 01:22:34.380]   If I've got, you know what?
[01:22:34.380 --> 01:22:36.940]   I got Eero when I finally got fit up with a,
[01:22:36.940 --> 01:22:40.020]   "Honey, the wifi's not working again."
[01:22:40.020 --> 01:22:41.700]   You don't want to hear that ever.
[01:22:41.700 --> 01:22:43.620]   Get Eero, you will never hear it again.
[01:22:43.620 --> 01:22:45.140]   E R O dot com, we think.
[01:22:45.140 --> 01:22:49.120]   If they're supportive, this week in tech.
[01:22:49.120 --> 01:22:52.740]   Speaking of devices in your pocket,
[01:22:52.740 --> 01:22:54.660]   devices with microphones,
[01:22:54.660 --> 01:22:58.020]   Amazon's putting echoes in hotel rooms now.
[01:22:58.020 --> 01:23:01.660]   There are two people, two kinds of people in the world now.
[01:23:01.660 --> 01:23:05.740]   People who don't mind devices with microphones in there,
[01:23:05.740 --> 01:23:08.360]   around them all the time and those who do.
[01:23:08.360 --> 01:23:13.220]   I'm wondering what Micah and Ben and Devinder,
[01:23:13.220 --> 01:23:15.460]   what group are you in?
[01:23:15.460 --> 01:23:16.620]   Do you-- - Oh my,
[01:23:16.620 --> 01:23:18.620]   they're microphones everywhere on me.
[01:23:18.620 --> 01:23:20.020]   I've got all the assistant-- - Carry it in your pocket,
[01:23:20.020 --> 01:23:21.820]   so why not have it in the house?
[01:23:21.820 --> 01:23:23.500]   - Yeah, I've got all the assistants hanging out
[01:23:23.500 --> 01:23:25.740]   waiting for me to bark at them.
[01:23:25.740 --> 01:23:27.500]   Bark come in. - Ben, are you a paranoid?
[01:23:27.500 --> 01:23:29.500]   Do you wear a tin foil hat?
[01:23:29.500 --> 01:23:32.020]   - I'm a little paranoid, but I will say,
[01:23:32.020 --> 01:23:36.260]   if my phone is with me, then I feel like that counts.
[01:23:36.260 --> 01:23:40.860]   So, and I use Google's assistant all the time and I love it.
[01:23:40.860 --> 01:23:44.060]   So, I did get a Google home.
[01:23:44.060 --> 01:23:47.340]   It's still in the box because the other half of my family
[01:23:47.340 --> 01:23:49.180]   won't let me take it out of the box.
[01:23:49.180 --> 01:23:50.740]   - Interesting.
[01:23:50.740 --> 01:23:53.220]   So, I'm not the only paranoid around here, I guess.
[01:23:53.220 --> 01:23:58.220]   But I do think having them in a hotel room,
[01:23:58.220 --> 01:24:00.780]   as long as there's no video,
[01:24:00.780 --> 01:24:03.060]   I think it's probably a good thing, right?
[01:24:03.060 --> 01:24:07.060]   Like, especially if you could actually turn the television on
[01:24:07.060 --> 01:24:10.100]   instead of like turning on the disgusting clicker,
[01:24:10.100 --> 01:24:12.820]   using the disgusting clicker, or being like,
[01:24:12.820 --> 01:24:14.860]   "Hey, can you call down to the front?"
[01:24:14.860 --> 01:24:16.780]   Like being able to just talk to a speaker
[01:24:16.780 --> 01:24:18.540]   and-- - You can order room service.
[01:24:18.540 --> 01:24:20.540]   - You can request housekeeping.
[01:24:20.540 --> 01:24:21.580]   You could play music. - Yeah.
[01:24:21.580 --> 01:24:24.220]   - It will control the blinds and the TV in some rooms.
[01:24:24.220 --> 01:24:26.900]   It's a special version of Echo.
[01:24:26.900 --> 01:24:28.220]   It's called the A word,
[01:24:28.220 --> 01:24:31.300]   I don't like to say the word out loud for hospitality.
[01:24:31.300 --> 01:24:34.420]   And it's initially gonna be at, select Mariettes,
[01:24:34.420 --> 01:24:36.540]   Weston Hotels, St. Regis, a loft,
[01:24:36.540 --> 01:24:38.740]   autograph collection hotels.
[01:24:38.740 --> 01:24:42.340]   The win in Vegas, and I think the Aria,
[01:24:42.340 --> 01:24:44.100]   couple of hotels in Vegas already had echoes,
[01:24:44.100 --> 01:24:46.180]   but they weren't special echoes.
[01:24:46.180 --> 01:24:48.780]   The real issue is, how do you reset?
[01:24:48.780 --> 01:24:51.460]   So, they need to reset it when you check out.
[01:24:51.460 --> 01:24:53.220]   And set it up for somebody new.
[01:24:53.220 --> 01:24:56.700]   According to Amazon, the Alexa for Hospital,
[01:24:56.700 --> 01:25:00.100]   oh, I said it, the A word for hospitality,
[01:25:00.100 --> 01:25:01.740]   commands are deleted daily.
[01:25:01.740 --> 01:25:05.580]   Hotels do not get access to the voice recordings.
[01:25:05.580 --> 01:25:07.180]   So, when you do room service,
[01:25:07.180 --> 01:25:09.020]   it doesn't send a recording down to room service,
[01:25:09.020 --> 01:25:10.780]   it actually just does a readout or something,
[01:25:10.780 --> 01:25:14.580]   saying, you know, send some hot dogs up to 743.
[01:25:14.580 --> 01:25:18.900]   However, hotels can use A word for hospitality
[01:25:18.900 --> 01:25:21.180]   to measure engagement through analytics.
[01:25:22.020 --> 01:25:23.220]   Or how does that even mean?
[01:25:23.220 --> 01:25:24.060]   I know.
[01:25:24.060 --> 01:25:24.900]   Yeah.
[01:25:24.900 --> 01:25:25.740]   That sounds suspicious.
[01:25:25.740 --> 01:25:28.660]   Or customize the deployment by choosing default music stations.
[01:25:28.660 --> 01:25:32.540]   Mariettes gonna offer TED Talks.
[01:25:32.540 --> 01:25:37.020]   'Cause there's no other way to get TED Talks, yeah.
[01:25:37.020 --> 01:25:39.300]   I guess maybe they can see how many people
[01:25:39.300 --> 01:25:42.300]   are using the call to room service function.
[01:25:42.300 --> 01:25:45.420]   That's the analytics they want, I'm sure, yeah.
[01:25:45.420 --> 01:25:48.380]   Yeah, like I have all, pretty much all of them in my house,
[01:25:48.380 --> 01:25:50.180]   'cause I got to test them.
[01:25:50.180 --> 01:25:52.500]   But I do agree, like they're people saying,
[01:25:52.500 --> 01:25:54.740]   there's a suggestion out there
[01:25:54.740 --> 01:25:57.380]   that you shouldn't buy these things for your family
[01:25:57.380 --> 01:25:59.300]   or friends unless you know they want it.
[01:25:59.300 --> 01:26:02.340]   And that's the thing, I wouldn't wanna put this on somebody.
[01:26:02.340 --> 01:26:04.500]   So yeah, Alexa makes a lot of sense for a hotel room,
[01:26:04.500 --> 01:26:06.300]   but hopefully, you know, if you don't want it there,
[01:26:06.300 --> 01:26:08.340]   you can just call and they'll take it away.
[01:26:08.340 --> 01:26:11.580]   For me, it got a lot more useful.
[01:26:11.580 --> 01:26:13.180]   Once I had its smart home devices,
[01:26:13.180 --> 01:26:15.820]   and once I can control my living room lights with Alexa,
[01:26:15.820 --> 01:26:16.660]   it's great.
[01:26:16.660 --> 01:26:19.700]   Would be really useful for stuff like that in a hotel.
[01:26:19.700 --> 01:26:21.300]   I'm worried about that aggregate data.
[01:26:21.300 --> 01:26:24.140]   I'm really worried about Amazon as a data collection,
[01:26:24.140 --> 01:26:27.540]   you know, company, because more and more
[01:26:27.540 --> 01:26:29.900]   I am losing faith in them in terms of,
[01:26:29.900 --> 01:26:31.860]   I don't know what they're doing too.
[01:26:31.860 --> 01:26:32.700]   So this is like--
[01:26:32.700 --> 01:26:33.580]   It's really a strategy though, right?
[01:26:33.580 --> 01:26:37.380]   To get echoes everywhere, just everywhere.
[01:26:37.380 --> 01:26:40.340]   You can get the ROHAV, Viva, put echo in your car.
[01:26:40.340 --> 01:26:43.500]   I just got the Fire TV Cube, which has echo.
[01:26:43.500 --> 01:26:44.420]   Oh, what do you think about that?
[01:26:44.420 --> 01:26:45.460]   I actually like it.
[01:26:45.460 --> 01:26:49.260]   It's not, so the idea is you use voice commands
[01:26:49.260 --> 01:26:50.740]   to turn your TV on.
[01:26:50.740 --> 01:26:52.540]   It will control your TV.
[01:26:52.540 --> 01:26:54.300]   I didn't have any trouble at new immediately
[01:26:54.300 --> 01:26:57.260]   what brand of the TV was and it controlled it immediately.
[01:26:57.260 --> 01:27:00.100]   Turn my AV receiver on and also recognize the brand.
[01:27:00.100 --> 01:27:01.980]   I don't know how, but it's on the same network,
[01:27:01.980 --> 01:27:03.660]   maybe it queried it.
[01:27:03.660 --> 01:27:06.420]   It doesn't control like your Apple TV or your Roku.
[01:27:06.420 --> 01:27:07.900]   What a surprise.
[01:27:07.900 --> 01:27:10.580]   It will control some set-top boxes, not T-vos,
[01:27:10.580 --> 01:27:12.460]   but some cable company set-top boxes.
[01:27:12.460 --> 01:27:16.780]   So in theory, you could say, you know, watch channel seven.
[01:27:16.780 --> 01:27:19.260]   But it's great because if you use Fire TV,
[01:27:19.260 --> 01:27:22.660]   if you've used Netflix or HBO Go or H Showtime Anywhere,
[01:27:22.660 --> 01:27:25.100]   NBC, ABC, if you use one of the channels available,
[01:27:25.100 --> 01:27:26.860]   they don't have YouTube weirdly enough.
[01:27:26.860 --> 01:27:29.380]   But one of the channels available on a Fire TV,
[01:27:29.380 --> 01:27:31.580]   all of those could be controlled with a voice.
[01:27:31.580 --> 01:27:35.860]   So I can walk into my office and say, echo,
[01:27:35.860 --> 01:27:36.900]   watch Westworld.
[01:27:36.900 --> 01:27:39.780]   It does, it will pop up a screen
[01:27:39.780 --> 01:27:43.420]   that then shows the movie Westworld and the TV show.
[01:27:43.420 --> 01:27:45.940]   And then you have to say, play number one.
[01:27:45.940 --> 01:27:48.100]   So there is some more interaction involved.
[01:27:48.100 --> 01:27:50.740]   But I could say pause, turn up the volume,
[01:27:50.740 --> 01:27:52.500]   turn down the volume.
[01:27:52.500 --> 01:27:55.020]   And I love the best part is I can walk out of the room and say,
[01:27:55.020 --> 01:27:57.420]   echo, turn the TV off and it turns the whole system off,
[01:27:57.420 --> 01:27:59.060]   which is nice. - Nice.
[01:27:59.060 --> 01:27:59.900]   - So it works.
[01:27:59.900 --> 01:28:01.020]   I mean, it's $120.
[01:28:01.020 --> 01:28:04.420]   It's not, you know, it's limited in its scope.
[01:28:04.420 --> 01:28:08.100]   It's not the ultimate remote control, you know,
[01:28:08.100 --> 01:28:09.180]   universal remote.
[01:28:09.180 --> 01:28:11.620]   - Yeah, I mean, these set-top boxes are getting boring,
[01:28:11.620 --> 01:28:13.740]   more boring and more boring every year.
[01:28:13.740 --> 01:28:16.420]   So they gotta have to, they have to put in some other features,
[01:28:16.420 --> 01:28:17.500]   right, to make it more interesting.
[01:28:17.500 --> 01:28:20.180]   - I like to be able to control stuff with my voice.
[01:28:20.180 --> 01:28:21.020]   - Yeah.
[01:28:21.020 --> 01:28:25.060]   - Although now I imagine Amazon knows everything I watch.
[01:28:25.060 --> 01:28:26.580]   - Yeah. - Right?
[01:28:26.580 --> 01:28:29.740]   Which adds I stay in the room for.
[01:28:29.740 --> 01:28:31.780]   - Which television you're using because it--
[01:28:31.780 --> 01:28:32.620]   - They know where the brand. - They never even brand.
[01:28:32.620 --> 01:28:33.780]   - But you set up the cube.
[01:28:33.780 --> 01:28:35.220]   - Yep, they know the brand.
[01:28:35.220 --> 01:28:38.740]   They know, you know, I mean, it's better than Nielsen.
[01:28:38.740 --> 01:28:40.820]   It's basically a Nielsen people meter.
[01:28:43.500 --> 01:28:46.820]   But again, it's like, well, so, I don't know,
[01:28:46.820 --> 01:28:49.820]   how can that be used against me, I guess is the question.
[01:28:49.820 --> 01:28:53.020]   Here's a question. - Right.
[01:28:53.020 --> 01:28:58.020]   - Do you think it's possible that with a duly written law
[01:28:58.020 --> 01:29:02.580]   enforcement warrant that law enforcement could say,
[01:29:02.580 --> 01:29:05.300]   just turn on Leo's echo, let's hear what he's doing.
[01:29:05.300 --> 01:29:08.140]   - I don't know. - Yeah.
[01:29:08.140 --> 01:29:09.540]   - I don't know. - Yeah.
[01:29:09.540 --> 01:29:11.340]   - I feel like there's some sort of precedent
[01:29:11.340 --> 01:29:13.300]   that would be against immediately
[01:29:13.300 --> 01:29:15.620]   'cause wouldn't you be able to do that for any phone too?
[01:29:15.620 --> 01:29:17.420]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:29:17.420 --> 01:29:18.980]   - Like wiretapping regulations. - What if you wrote
[01:29:18.980 --> 01:29:20.820]   a national security letter that said
[01:29:20.820 --> 01:29:23.780]   you can't tell anybody, it would have to have a warrant.
[01:29:23.780 --> 01:29:26.140]   I'm not saying it could be without a warrant.
[01:29:26.140 --> 01:29:27.540]   But why can't they?
[01:29:27.540 --> 01:29:30.780]   See, so I asked Phil Zimmerman, PGP creator,
[01:29:30.780 --> 01:29:32.140]   about this going dark issue.
[01:29:32.140 --> 01:29:33.900]   'Cause law enforcement saying, oh, we're going dark.
[01:29:33.900 --> 01:29:35.900]   All this encryption, we can't tell what people are doing.
[01:29:35.900 --> 01:29:36.900]   It's terrible.
[01:29:36.900 --> 01:29:39.060]   He said, they're not going dark.
[01:29:39.060 --> 01:29:41.340]   In fact, there's this thing called Zimmerman's law
[01:29:41.340 --> 01:29:43.860]   that says with technology, the ability to surveil people
[01:29:43.860 --> 01:29:46.740]   increase logarithmically.
[01:29:46.740 --> 01:29:48.860]   And I think he's right.
[01:29:48.860 --> 01:29:51.260]   He says, basically, law enforcement now
[01:29:51.260 --> 01:29:54.100]   has an incredible high def screen.
[01:29:54.100 --> 01:29:57.460]   They can see everything going on.
[01:29:57.460 --> 01:30:00.340]   There's a few little black dots
[01:30:00.340 --> 01:30:03.220]   because they can't hear your Skype or read your messages.
[01:30:03.220 --> 01:30:05.500]   A few little black dots, they don't like that.
[01:30:05.500 --> 01:30:06.740]   They don't want any dead pixels.
[01:30:06.740 --> 01:30:08.260]   They want a perfect screen.
[01:30:08.260 --> 01:30:11.220]   But they sure as hell, he says, are not going dark.
[01:30:11.220 --> 01:30:12.900]   They have more ability to surveil you
[01:30:12.900 --> 01:30:13.740]   than ever before.
[01:30:13.740 --> 01:30:16.540]   Cameras everywhere, microphones everywhere.
[01:30:16.540 --> 01:30:19.700]   I have to agree with it on that.
[01:30:19.700 --> 01:30:20.660]   Mm-hmm.
[01:30:20.660 --> 01:30:22.380]   Yeah, I mean, that seems fair.
[01:30:22.380 --> 01:30:23.340]   And I like that.
[01:30:23.340 --> 01:30:24.660]   I like that metaphor.
[01:30:24.660 --> 01:30:25.580]   That's a good one.
[01:30:25.580 --> 01:30:26.580]   Yeah.
[01:30:26.580 --> 01:30:27.980]   Yeah, I'm going to use it from now on.
[01:30:27.980 --> 01:30:28.820]   I just did it.
[01:30:28.820 --> 01:30:29.700]   Good, good.
[01:30:29.700 --> 01:30:30.700]   But at least I gave him credit.
[01:30:30.700 --> 01:30:32.660]   You can use it because you got it for me at second hand.
[01:30:32.660 --> 01:30:33.740]   You could just pretend.
[01:30:33.740 --> 01:30:34.580]   (laughs)
[01:30:34.580 --> 01:30:35.420]   I just tossed it around.
[01:30:35.420 --> 01:30:36.260]   Ten years thought of it.
[01:30:36.260 --> 01:30:37.100]   So guess what?
[01:30:37.100 --> 01:30:37.940]   There's this big screen.
[01:30:37.940 --> 01:30:39.300]   (laughs)
[01:30:39.300 --> 01:30:42.740]   Stacey Higginbotham, who is our co-host on this week in Google,
[01:30:42.740 --> 01:30:44.380]   wrote a good article on her.
[01:30:44.380 --> 01:30:47.820]   Stacey and I, out to Amazon's Echo Everywhere strategy
[01:30:47.820 --> 01:30:50.180]   is brilliant helping me.
[01:30:50.180 --> 01:30:53.300]   I have to say, I thought Google was going to kill him.
[01:30:53.300 --> 01:30:55.060]   And along comes Google Home.
[01:30:55.060 --> 01:30:57.420]   Google's got all this AI skill.
[01:30:57.420 --> 01:30:59.060]   They're going to kill him.
[01:30:59.060 --> 01:31:01.500]   And Amazon is not so easily killed.
[01:31:01.500 --> 01:31:03.860]   Amazon got to--
[01:31:03.860 --> 01:31:05.180]   You just give it away for free.
[01:31:05.180 --> 01:31:06.020]   Yeah.
[01:31:06.020 --> 01:31:07.180]   That's why.
[01:31:07.180 --> 01:31:11.420]   The way they climbed into the normal consumer space
[01:31:11.420 --> 01:31:14.140]   is not the people who are super big tech heads
[01:31:14.140 --> 01:31:17.820]   and then the people who are sort of one ring removed from that,
[01:31:17.820 --> 01:31:20.740]   but like the everyday person for some reason
[01:31:20.740 --> 01:31:24.540]   just latched onto these Amazon voice devices.
[01:31:24.540 --> 01:31:29.540]   And more and more, you see so many people talking about this,
[01:31:29.540 --> 01:31:31.380]   the Echo devices in their home.
[01:31:31.380 --> 01:31:35.300]   And the way that Amazon started by making sure
[01:31:35.300 --> 01:31:37.860]   that it could work with so many different developers
[01:31:37.860 --> 01:31:42.220]   in terms of IoT, I think that that really helped kick things off
[01:31:42.220 --> 01:31:45.380]   because there were a lot of people playing around
[01:31:45.380 --> 01:31:48.460]   with smart home stuff who wanted the ability to control
[01:31:48.460 --> 01:31:49.700]   that with their voice.
[01:31:49.700 --> 01:31:52.580]   And Apple wasn't doing a great job at the time
[01:31:52.580 --> 01:31:54.100]   of integrating with a lot of them.
[01:31:54.100 --> 01:31:58.380]   And then the Google Assistant, that integration came later.
[01:31:58.380 --> 01:32:01.820]   But Amazon just did a really good job of getting it out there
[01:32:01.820 --> 01:32:06.820]   and getting it out there quickly and sort of somehow convincing
[01:32:06.820 --> 01:32:09.020]   the mass market that it was a good idea
[01:32:09.020 --> 01:32:09.860]   to have this product.
[01:32:09.860 --> 01:32:10.900]   I don't know.
[01:32:10.900 --> 01:32:12.220]   Yeah, I mean, it was doing,
[01:32:12.220 --> 01:32:14.460]   it was really the voice control stuff too,
[01:32:14.460 --> 01:32:17.500]   'cause we had voice commands on our phones
[01:32:17.500 --> 01:32:21.740]   before the A word came out in the Echo.
[01:32:21.740 --> 01:32:23.740]   But Amazon, I think, did it a bit smarter.
[01:32:23.740 --> 01:32:25.220]   And they have a history as a company
[01:32:25.220 --> 01:32:27.260]   of just making unique products
[01:32:27.260 --> 01:32:29.500]   and nobody else really saw the need for it, right?
[01:32:29.500 --> 01:32:33.260]   Like the Kindle and their bet on cloud computing,
[01:32:33.260 --> 01:32:36.140]   I remember too, was kind of controversial at the time.
[01:32:36.140 --> 01:32:37.220]   And now they're done it, right?
[01:32:37.220 --> 01:32:39.500]   Amazon Web Services is number one easily.
[01:32:39.500 --> 01:32:40.340]   Yeah.
[01:32:40.340 --> 01:32:42.380]   So they make these big bets and they don't always work.
[01:32:42.380 --> 01:32:44.180]   There was the fire phone, right?
[01:32:44.180 --> 01:32:45.780]   (laughs)
[01:32:45.780 --> 01:32:47.340]   But good smart bets.
[01:32:47.340 --> 01:32:51.220]   And I think, yeah, the key is tying it all to IoT stuff.
[01:32:51.220 --> 01:32:54.300]   IoT devices, I never wanted a Hue set
[01:32:54.300 --> 01:32:56.180]   before I had an Alexa or something like that.
[01:32:56.180 --> 01:32:57.020]   Me too.
[01:32:57.020 --> 01:32:59.420]   And now, I love it when I go to bed,
[01:32:59.420 --> 01:33:01.060]   I say Echo, turn the lights off.
[01:33:01.060 --> 01:33:02.180]   I love that.
[01:33:02.180 --> 01:33:03.020]   It's perfect.
[01:33:03.020 --> 01:33:05.340]   'Cause who wants to go to an app to control their lights
[01:33:05.340 --> 01:33:06.420]   when you could just go to the Switch
[01:33:06.420 --> 01:33:07.260]   and just hit a button like,
[01:33:07.260 --> 01:33:08.100]   it solves that problem.
[01:33:08.100 --> 01:33:08.940]   That's not easier.
[01:33:08.940 --> 01:33:09.780]   Voice control is easier.
[01:33:09.780 --> 01:33:11.740]   Yeah. It drives my wife crazy.
[01:33:11.740 --> 01:33:13.780]   And as a result, drives me crazy
[01:33:13.780 --> 01:33:16.420]   because she goes around and turns off all the switches.
[01:33:16.420 --> 01:33:17.260]   (laughs)
[01:33:17.260 --> 01:33:18.100]   Oh no.
[01:33:18.100 --> 01:33:21.820]   Now, I have to go on and turn on all the switches.
[01:33:21.820 --> 01:33:24.540]   And then I can say turn the lights off.
[01:33:24.540 --> 01:33:26.700]   See, that's why smart switches,
[01:33:26.700 --> 01:33:29.020]   smart in-wall switches are so much better than
[01:33:29.020 --> 01:33:30.860]   smart in the next step, right?
[01:33:30.860 --> 01:33:32.140]   Yeah, that's the next step.
[01:33:32.140 --> 01:33:32.980]   Yeah.
[01:33:32.980 --> 01:33:36.820]   Here is from Stacey's Stacey and IoT blog.
[01:33:36.820 --> 01:33:39.820]   This is courtesy voicebot.ai.
[01:33:39.820 --> 01:33:41.180]   Look at the skills.
[01:33:41.180 --> 01:33:43.060]   This is for the Amazon Echo.
[01:33:43.060 --> 01:33:44.420]   When it was introduced,
[01:33:44.420 --> 01:33:46.740]   it took about a year to get 5,000.
[01:33:46.740 --> 01:33:48.940]   Now there are 30,000 skills.
[01:33:48.940 --> 01:33:51.020]   And this is gonna be important too, isn't it?
[01:33:51.020 --> 01:33:52.340]   Apple started to recognize this.
[01:33:52.340 --> 01:33:54.060]   If you wanna make Siri smarter,
[01:33:54.060 --> 01:33:58.620]   you get third party people developing tools for it.
[01:33:58.620 --> 01:34:01.380]   And Amazon owns this one, right?
[01:34:01.380 --> 01:34:03.900]   Yeah, promise there's only of that 30,000,
[01:34:03.900 --> 01:34:06.220]   and there are only 5,000 that are worth anyone's time.
[01:34:06.220 --> 01:34:07.060]   (laughs)
[01:34:07.060 --> 01:34:07.900]   Yeah.
[01:34:07.900 --> 01:34:09.380]   Well, there are 20,000 fart skills.
[01:34:09.380 --> 01:34:10.220]   Exactly.
[01:34:10.220 --> 01:34:11.060]   Yeah.
[01:34:11.060 --> 01:34:13.100]   Or like cat sounds or dogs out.
[01:34:13.100 --> 01:34:14.180]   There's so many carols.
[01:34:14.180 --> 01:34:15.420]   There's a lot of bark sounds.
[01:34:15.420 --> 01:34:16.260]   Yeah.
[01:34:16.260 --> 01:34:17.780]   But there's a lot of room for people to experiment.
[01:34:17.780 --> 01:34:22.260]   I saw, what was it, ToyCon in New York this year?
[01:34:22.260 --> 01:34:25.460]   There are a lot of board games that use Alexa
[01:34:25.460 --> 01:34:26.580]   in cool ways.
[01:34:26.580 --> 01:34:28.580]   Have you done the Westworld game yet?
[01:34:28.580 --> 01:34:29.620]   I have not done that.
[01:34:29.620 --> 01:34:32.180]   But there are full things that you like that.
[01:34:32.180 --> 01:34:33.020]   Yeah.
[01:34:33.020 --> 01:34:37.220]   So you can, so I think you have to say something like echo,
[01:34:37.220 --> 01:34:40.460]   access the Westworld skillers task or something like that.
[01:34:40.460 --> 01:34:44.140]   But then it has like, it's a audio game.
[01:34:44.140 --> 01:34:45.980]   I think Skyrim has one.
[01:34:45.980 --> 01:34:50.180]   So this is really interesting to me.
[01:34:50.180 --> 01:34:51.020]   Yeah.
[01:34:51.020 --> 01:34:53.900]   Voice activated, choose your own adventure.
[01:34:53.900 --> 01:34:55.980]   Yeah, that's basically exactly what it is.
[01:34:55.980 --> 01:34:57.180]   Exactly what it has been.
[01:34:57.180 --> 01:34:58.020]   Yeah.
[01:34:59.020 --> 01:35:02.500]   You know, I have to give Jeff Bezos some credit.
[01:35:02.500 --> 01:35:03.340]   He's a smart guy.
[01:35:03.340 --> 01:35:04.780]   And I think you have to give Amazon some credit
[01:35:04.780 --> 01:35:08.260]   for seeing something that is now maybe one of the hottest,
[01:35:08.260 --> 01:35:09.780]   most interesting areas in tech.
[01:35:09.780 --> 01:35:10.860]   Is these voices?
[01:35:10.860 --> 01:35:12.500]   And they probably recognize before anybody
[01:35:12.500 --> 01:35:14.900]   that Bluetooth, like wireless speakers in general,
[01:35:14.900 --> 01:35:16.180]   were a hot item, right?
[01:35:16.180 --> 01:35:19.620]   Like all the, remember a job zone and all those things.
[01:35:19.620 --> 01:35:21.740]   Like they saw how much those things were selling.
[01:35:21.740 --> 01:35:24.900]   So I think they kind of extrapolated that consumer demand
[01:35:24.900 --> 01:35:26.860]   adding some functionality on top of that.
[01:35:26.860 --> 01:35:28.060]   They probably saw where that was going.
[01:35:28.060 --> 01:35:28.940]   That's interesting.
[01:35:28.940 --> 01:35:32.540]   So Amazon has the data because they sell everything.
[01:35:32.540 --> 01:35:36.740]   So that gives them a leg up on what to do next.
[01:35:36.740 --> 01:35:37.580]   Yeah.
[01:35:37.580 --> 01:35:39.220]   That's interesting.
[01:35:39.220 --> 01:35:40.620]   I never even thought of that.
[01:35:40.620 --> 01:35:44.220]   New York Times had an article.
[01:35:44.220 --> 01:35:49.260]   I was it, might have been yesterday the day before.
[01:35:49.260 --> 01:35:50.780]   Amazon's house brands.
[01:35:50.780 --> 01:35:53.820]   Do you know that they have a hundred house brands?
[01:35:53.820 --> 01:35:56.460]   They kind of, they kind of obvivy skate a little bit
[01:35:56.460 --> 01:35:58.740]   to it's hard to sort of know,
[01:35:58.740 --> 01:36:00.740]   other than the ones that specifically have Amazon.
[01:36:00.740 --> 01:36:02.460]   Yeah, you kind of have to go look for the list.
[01:36:02.460 --> 01:36:04.500]   And it's like, wait, I've purchased that before.
[01:36:04.500 --> 01:36:05.860]   I didn't know that was Amazon's brand.
[01:36:05.860 --> 01:36:07.500]   - I spotted Zebra for kids clothes.
[01:36:07.500 --> 01:36:10.620]   Good brief for men's underwear is wag for dog food,
[01:36:10.620 --> 01:36:13.120]   rivet for home furnishings,
[01:36:13.120 --> 01:36:17.260]   lark and row sells cap sleeve dresses
[01:36:17.260 --> 01:36:19.940]   and go on and on and on.
[01:36:19.940 --> 01:36:21.260]   And these are all really Amazon.
[01:36:21.260 --> 01:36:22.660]   You're buying it directly from Amazon.
[01:36:22.660 --> 01:36:24.980]   It's just that they realize that you want to buy it
[01:36:24.980 --> 01:36:27.060]   from a brand.
[01:36:27.060 --> 01:36:30.060]   So, Amazon basics, I buy a lot of batteries
[01:36:30.060 --> 01:36:31.700]   and stuff from Amazon basics.
[01:36:31.700 --> 01:36:34.420]   But there are many, there's a hundred other brands.
[01:36:34.420 --> 01:36:38.540]   - Amazon basics has the name in it,
[01:36:38.540 --> 01:36:40.580]   but yeah, Amazon basics is my,
[01:36:40.580 --> 01:36:42.540]   I've used Amazon basics a ton.
[01:36:42.540 --> 01:36:47.180]   Like I buy all my Apple stuff from Amazon basics basically.
[01:36:47.180 --> 01:36:48.820]   - So, but what's interesting is,
[01:36:48.820 --> 01:36:50.940]   and this is the New York Times contention,
[01:36:50.940 --> 01:36:53.980]   this could open them up to antitrust action.
[01:36:53.980 --> 01:36:56.420]   For instance, if you go to search on Amazon
[01:36:56.420 --> 01:36:58.900]   for Ralph Lauren polo shirts,
[01:36:58.900 --> 01:37:00.180]   they don't, you won't find them,
[01:37:00.180 --> 01:37:03.540]   but you will find Amazon essential polos
[01:37:03.540 --> 01:37:06.020]   and you will find good threads polos.
[01:37:06.020 --> 01:37:06.860]   And you might say, oh good,
[01:37:06.860 --> 01:37:07.940]   I've got a couple of brands,
[01:37:07.940 --> 01:37:09.540]   both of them are in Amazon.
[01:37:09.540 --> 01:37:10.540]   - Both of them are in Amazon.
[01:37:10.540 --> 01:37:13.460]   - I've been able to handle some problems with this, right?
[01:37:13.460 --> 01:37:14.660]   - Some gold shopping,
[01:37:14.660 --> 01:37:16.180]   cost them a little money in Europe.
[01:37:16.180 --> 01:37:17.340]   - Yeah, yep.
[01:37:17.340 --> 01:37:19.340]   - Exactly, it's very similar.
[01:37:19.340 --> 01:37:23.820]   - So, apparently Amazon sells retail analytics.
[01:37:24.580 --> 01:37:27.820]   And you pay 1% of your wholesale cost of goods
[01:37:27.820 --> 01:37:29.260]   to Amazon to get these,
[01:37:29.260 --> 01:37:32.380]   or a minimum of $100,000.
[01:37:32.380 --> 01:37:36.580]   And you get Amazon's premium version
[01:37:36.580 --> 01:37:37.540]   of their retail analytics.
[01:37:37.540 --> 01:37:39.020]   In other words, this is exactly
[01:37:39.020 --> 01:37:39.980]   what you were saying to vendor.
[01:37:39.980 --> 01:37:42.740]   This is how Amazon develops new products.
[01:37:42.740 --> 01:37:44.980]   And if you are willing to spend a lot of money,
[01:37:44.980 --> 01:37:46.780]   you can get access to that as well.
[01:37:46.780 --> 01:37:50.580]   You also get the negatives, right?
[01:37:50.580 --> 01:37:53.220]   They get all the reviews, they get all the returns.
[01:37:54.220 --> 01:37:56.220]   - Yeah, it'd be nice to,
[01:37:56.220 --> 01:37:58.220]   as someone's selling things,
[01:37:58.220 --> 01:38:00.220]   it would be nice to have this information for sure.
[01:38:00.220 --> 01:38:02.220]   - You don't get to be the richest man in the world
[01:38:02.220 --> 01:38:04.220]   by the lemonade stand.
[01:38:04.220 --> 01:38:05.220]   (laughs)
[01:38:05.220 --> 01:38:07.220]   You own all the lemons.
[01:38:07.220 --> 01:38:12.220]   - But it is crazy, like Amazon flouts its weight
[01:38:12.220 --> 01:38:14.220]   in such strange ways, right?
[01:38:14.220 --> 01:38:15.220]   Like there are things like,
[01:38:15.220 --> 01:38:18.220]   for a while you couldn't buy Apple products,
[01:38:18.220 --> 01:38:19.220]   was it through Amazon?
[01:38:19.220 --> 01:38:20.220]   - Yeah, that's right.
[01:38:20.220 --> 01:38:22.220]   - You can't pre-order Disney movies on Blu-ray.
[01:38:22.220 --> 01:38:25.220]   Through Amazon, you can buy them when they're released,
[01:38:25.220 --> 01:38:26.220]   but you can't pre-order them.
[01:38:26.220 --> 01:38:27.220]   - And why do you think that is?
[01:38:27.220 --> 01:38:29.220]   What's their retail advantage there?
[01:38:29.220 --> 01:38:31.220]   - Well, because they're selling movies,
[01:38:31.220 --> 01:38:32.220]   they're selling digital movies.
[01:38:32.220 --> 01:38:34.220]   So I wonder if you can pre-order the Amazon
[01:38:34.220 --> 01:38:36.220]   when I haven't looked into this fully.
[01:38:36.220 --> 01:38:37.220]   But I just see them doing these things
[01:38:37.220 --> 01:38:39.220]   that are very forceful and very,
[01:38:39.220 --> 01:38:41.220]   it's not a free platform after all,
[01:38:41.220 --> 01:38:43.220]   it's their platform.
[01:38:43.220 --> 01:38:46.220]   But the way they kind of strong arm becomes interesting,
[01:38:46.220 --> 01:38:47.220]   isn't it?
[01:38:47.220 --> 01:38:48.220]   - Oh yeah, it's messed up.
[01:38:48.220 --> 01:38:51.220]   - There was some Google news around that too, right?
[01:38:51.220 --> 01:38:53.220]   Like the whole, I think it was Chromecast
[01:38:53.220 --> 01:38:55.220]   and a couple of other things.
[01:38:55.220 --> 01:38:57.220]   Yeah, it's really interesting to see them
[01:38:57.220 --> 01:38:59.220]   throw their weight around that way.
[01:38:59.220 --> 01:39:00.220]   I mean, it's terrifying.
[01:39:00.220 --> 01:39:02.220]   - Well, publishers have said this for years.
[01:39:02.220 --> 01:39:05.220]   Publishers have said for years that Jeff is murder on that.
[01:39:05.220 --> 01:39:07.220]   Talking them down.
[01:39:07.220 --> 01:39:08.220]   Let's take a little break.
[01:39:08.220 --> 01:39:10.220]   Devindra Hardwar, senior editor and gadget.
[01:39:10.220 --> 01:39:11.220]   Great to have you.
[01:39:11.220 --> 01:39:16.220]   Ben Brock Johnson, WBR, senior producer over there.
[01:39:16.220 --> 01:39:17.220]   The Brock Johnson on the Twitter,
[01:39:17.220 --> 01:39:18.220]   and of course, Mike Sargent,
[01:39:18.220 --> 01:39:21.220]   senior editor at Mobile Nations.
[01:39:21.220 --> 01:39:23.220]   See, I'm not the only senior here.
[01:39:23.220 --> 01:39:26.220]   (laughing)
[01:39:26.220 --> 01:39:27.220]   We'll be back in just a second.
[01:39:27.220 --> 01:39:29.220]   We're going to take a little break though.
[01:39:29.220 --> 01:39:32.220]   For those of you who were here every second
[01:39:32.220 --> 01:39:33.220]   of every day all week long,
[01:39:33.220 --> 01:39:35.220]   there was some good stuff on Twitter this week.
[01:39:35.220 --> 01:39:36.220]   Watch.
[01:39:36.220 --> 01:39:38.220]   - Previously on Twitter.
[01:39:38.220 --> 01:39:40.220]   - And now you've got to be careful around bold.
[01:39:40.220 --> 01:39:43.220]   In many times we have more than 12 bolts
[01:39:43.220 --> 01:39:45.220]   hanging around a field day site.
[01:39:45.220 --> 01:39:50.220]   And we want you to see what occurs at 100 volts.
[01:39:50.220 --> 01:39:54.220]   That is your body with 100 volts passing through the inside.
[01:39:54.220 --> 01:39:57.220]   So don't let this be you.
[01:39:57.220 --> 01:39:59.220]   - Windows Weekly.
[01:39:59.220 --> 01:40:01.220]   - Arlington officials last year.
[01:40:01.220 --> 01:40:02.220]   This isn't the journal today.
[01:40:02.220 --> 01:40:04.220]   Arlington, Texas will start construction
[01:40:04.220 --> 01:40:06.220]   on a 100,000 square foot arena
[01:40:06.220 --> 01:40:08.220]   for live video game competitions.
[01:40:08.220 --> 01:40:09.220]   It's one of a number,
[01:40:09.220 --> 01:40:10.220]   according to the journal,
[01:40:10.220 --> 01:40:13.220]   of growing number of venues dedicated to esports.
[01:40:13.220 --> 01:40:15.220]   This is about to break out.
[01:40:15.220 --> 01:40:18.220]   And I would imagine the attendees
[01:40:18.220 --> 01:40:21.220]   probably consume far more food and beer.
[01:40:21.220 --> 01:40:23.220]   - Some of these guys will probably have to be wheelbarreled
[01:40:23.220 --> 01:40:25.220]   in, you know.
[01:40:25.220 --> 01:40:26.220]   (laughing)
[01:40:26.220 --> 01:40:27.220]   - Security now.
[01:40:27.220 --> 01:40:30.220]   - All of our listeners know that I have
[01:40:30.220 --> 01:40:34.220]   rather infamously been sticking with Windows XP
[01:40:34.220 --> 01:40:37.220]   because it works just fine
[01:40:37.220 --> 01:40:41.220]   until yesterday morning when I was unable to bring it back to life.
[01:40:41.220 --> 01:40:44.220]   - But you're gonna use a more modern version of Windows, right?
[01:40:44.220 --> 01:40:45.220]   - I'm on seven.
[01:40:45.220 --> 01:40:46.220]   - Yes, I'm on seven.
[01:40:46.220 --> 01:40:47.220]   - I'm now on seven.
[01:40:47.220 --> 01:40:48.220]   - I bet.
[01:40:48.220 --> 01:40:49.220]   - I think it'll be faster.
[01:40:49.220 --> 01:40:51.220]   - Oh boy, is it fast.
[01:40:51.220 --> 01:40:52.220]   (laughing)
[01:40:52.220 --> 01:40:54.220]   - I mean, I'm just not used to it.
[01:40:54.220 --> 01:40:56.220]   - Steve, it's normal.
[01:40:56.220 --> 01:40:58.220]   You're just been on a slum.
[01:40:58.220 --> 01:41:01.220]   - I used to think, boy, these pages have gotten so big
[01:41:01.220 --> 01:41:03.220]   since it's donated.
[01:41:03.220 --> 01:41:04.220]   - Tweet.
[01:41:04.220 --> 01:41:06.220]   Now in color.
[01:41:06.220 --> 01:41:08.220]   (upbeat music)
[01:41:08.220 --> 01:41:09.220]   - Oh, I'm excited.
[01:41:09.220 --> 01:41:11.220]   We finally, after many years,
[01:41:11.220 --> 01:41:14.220]   Steve's Windows 7 review, we can't wait.
[01:41:14.220 --> 01:41:17.220]   Hey, let me talk about toothpaste and toothbrushes.
[01:41:17.220 --> 01:41:18.220]   I got a good one.
[01:41:18.220 --> 01:41:21.220]   First of all, we have a friend who just went to the dentist
[01:41:21.220 --> 01:41:23.220]   and said, "The dentist said, 'What are you--'
[01:41:23.220 --> 01:41:25.220]   Oh, it was Debbie.
[01:41:25.220 --> 01:41:26.220]   It was Lisa's sister.
[01:41:26.220 --> 01:41:28.220]   He said, 'What are you been brushing with?
[01:41:28.220 --> 01:41:29.220]   This is amazing.
[01:41:29.220 --> 01:41:30.220]   This is the best check I've ever had.'
[01:41:30.220 --> 01:41:31.220]   She said, 'I've been using quip.'
[01:41:31.220 --> 01:41:34.220]   He said, 'I hear more and more people using quip.'
[01:41:34.220 --> 01:41:38.220]   Quip is the only subscription electric toothbrush accepted
[01:41:38.220 --> 01:41:40.220]   by the American Dental Association.
[01:41:40.220 --> 01:41:42.220]   But here's why I like it.
[01:41:42.220 --> 01:41:43.220]   I like toothbrush.
[01:41:43.220 --> 01:41:46.220]   I think we can all acknowledge is a better way to brush.
[01:41:46.220 --> 01:41:48.220]   In fact, I've used an electric toothbrush for so long,
[01:41:48.220 --> 01:41:50.220]   I forgot how to brush.
[01:41:50.220 --> 01:41:52.220]   I get a manual toothbrush and I go,
[01:41:52.220 --> 01:41:54.220]   'How do you--'
[01:41:54.220 --> 01:41:56.220]   I just can't-- my hand doesn't work that way.
[01:41:56.220 --> 01:41:57.220]   I just like to put it in my mouth and--
[01:41:57.220 --> 01:41:59.220]   The quip does all of the important things,
[01:41:59.220 --> 01:42:01.220]   like it buzzes every 30 seconds to say,
[01:42:01.220 --> 01:42:03.220]   'Moved another quadrant.'
[01:42:03.220 --> 01:42:04.220]   But here's the thing.
[01:42:04.220 --> 01:42:06.220]   First of all, it's a lot less than any other electric toothbrush.
[01:42:06.220 --> 01:42:08.220]   $25.
[01:42:08.220 --> 01:42:10.220]   And they have a subscription plan where they deliver you
[01:42:10.220 --> 01:42:12.220]   new brushheads on a dentist-recommended schedule
[01:42:12.220 --> 01:42:14.220]   every three months for just $5.
[01:42:14.220 --> 01:42:16.220]   That includes free shipping.
[01:42:16.220 --> 01:42:19.220]   They also-- though, they've got other things that I love about it.
[01:42:19.220 --> 01:42:22.220]   They've got a little mount that goes right on your mirror
[01:42:22.220 --> 01:42:24.220]   so you will never forget to brush.
[01:42:24.220 --> 01:42:26.220]   It's got a little adhesive sticky on it.
[01:42:26.220 --> 01:42:27.220]   It goes right there.
[01:42:27.220 --> 01:42:29.220]   So you see it when you go into the bathroom.
[01:42:29.220 --> 01:42:31.220]   It's so inexpensive you can have multiple.
[01:42:31.220 --> 01:42:34.220]   We've got a couple because our 15-year-old has sleepovers
[01:42:34.220 --> 01:42:36.220]   all the time and they never bring toothbrushes.
[01:42:36.220 --> 01:42:38.220]   It's always, 'Oh, I guess I forgot it.'
[01:42:38.220 --> 01:42:39.220]   No problem.
[01:42:39.220 --> 01:42:41.220]   We have your quip right here.
[01:42:41.220 --> 01:42:43.220]   We just get heads for all his friends.
[01:42:43.220 --> 01:42:44.220]   We have it right here.
[01:42:44.220 --> 01:42:46.220]   It's also the ultimate travel toothbrush.
[01:42:46.220 --> 01:42:48.220]   It's lightweight.
[01:42:48.220 --> 01:42:49.220]   It doesn't have a charger.
[01:42:49.220 --> 01:42:50.220]   It's battery powered.
[01:42:50.220 --> 01:42:51.220]   And the bag goes for months.
[01:42:51.220 --> 01:42:54.220]   So you just replace the battery and you go for more months.
[01:42:54.220 --> 01:42:56.220]   So it is the perfect for traveling.
[01:42:56.220 --> 01:42:58.220]   Everybody loves quip.
[01:42:58.220 --> 01:42:59.220]   Not just me.
[01:42:59.220 --> 01:43:01.220]   Oprah put them on the O-list.
[01:43:01.220 --> 01:43:03.220]   Time magazine said it was one of the best inventions
[01:43:03.220 --> 01:43:04.220]   of the year.
[01:43:04.220 --> 01:43:07.220]   And as I said, it's the first subscription electric toothbrush
[01:43:07.220 --> 01:43:11.220]   accepted by the ADA backed by a network of 20,000 dentists
[01:43:11.220 --> 01:43:15.220]   and hygienists and of course hundreds of thousands of happy
[01:43:15.220 --> 01:43:17.220]   brushes who use quip every day.
[01:43:17.220 --> 01:43:20.220]   If it's time to replace your old toothbrush, maybe you just
[01:43:20.220 --> 01:43:23.220]   because you want it, they do sell toothpaste by the subscription

[01:43:59.220 --> 01:44:06.220]   If you lost money to Mount Gox, some very good news.
[01:44:06.220 --> 01:44:10.220]   The Japanese courts have allowed, apparently I didn't realize
[01:44:10.220 --> 01:44:11.220]   this.
[01:44:11.220 --> 01:44:13.220]   You remember that this was a big scandal, right?
[01:44:13.220 --> 01:44:16.220]   Mount Gox, where everybody put their bitcoins, one of the early
[01:44:16.220 --> 01:44:19.220]   wallets, one of the early exchanges was hacked.
[01:44:19.220 --> 01:44:25.220]   Oh, like it was hacked by disco fiends.
[01:44:25.220 --> 01:44:27.220]   It was hacked.
[01:44:27.220 --> 01:44:31.220]   And they lost 850,000 bitcoins.
[01:44:31.220 --> 01:44:35.220]   At the time valued at almost half a billion dollars now, a lot
[01:44:35.220 --> 01:44:36.220]   more.
[01:44:36.220 --> 01:44:38.220]   Still the biggest theft of bitcoins in history.
[01:44:38.220 --> 01:44:43.220]   Mount Gox discovered 200,000, almost half, well, actually it's
[01:44:43.220 --> 01:44:45.220]   a quarter of those bitcoins.
[01:44:45.220 --> 01:44:49.220]   But it's been frozen ever since in the bankruptcy ruling.
[01:44:49.220 --> 01:44:52.220]   They finally got a court four years later say, you know what,
[01:44:52.220 --> 01:44:55.220]   unfreezes, at least you can repay people.
[01:44:55.220 --> 01:44:58.220]   And the good news is because bitcoins gone up so much in value
[01:44:58.220 --> 01:45:03.220]   since then, many people who have lost money in Bitcoin will get
[01:45:03.220 --> 01:45:06.220]   the at Mount Gox will get their money back.
[01:45:06.220 --> 01:45:12.220]   So if you did lose money in that Mount Gox failure, please seek
[01:45:12.220 --> 01:45:13.220]   redress.
[01:45:13.220 --> 01:45:16.220]   There will be a claim filing process.
[01:45:16.220 --> 01:45:19.220]   You'll have to somehow prove this is going to be the hard
[01:45:19.220 --> 01:45:20.220]   thing.
[01:45:20.220 --> 01:45:23.220]   Yeah, you had that Bitcoin there.
[01:45:23.220 --> 01:45:25.220]   And they'll solve this.
[01:45:25.220 --> 01:45:27.220]   So it might be a while before you get your money, but at least
[01:45:27.220 --> 01:45:29.220]   there's some hope.
[01:45:29.220 --> 01:45:31.220]   That that's got to hurt.
[01:45:31.220 --> 01:45:34.220]   You know, you lose hundreds of thousands of dollars in
[01:45:34.220 --> 01:45:36.220]   imaginary money.
[01:45:36.220 --> 01:45:37.220]   Yeah.
[01:45:37.220 --> 01:45:42.220]   I'll see you even more when it's imaginary.
[01:45:42.220 --> 01:45:49.220]   I have I have a lot I had 130,000 in imaginary money because I
[01:45:49.220 --> 01:45:53.220]   forgot my password and I have seven bitcoins sitting in a wall
[01:45:53.220 --> 01:45:56.220]   and I'm looking at it, but I can't get into it.
[01:45:56.220 --> 01:45:59.220]   Now when when Bitcoin was 20 grand, that really hurt.
[01:45:59.220 --> 01:46:03.220]   Now, why was that not in a password manager?
[01:46:03.220 --> 01:46:04.220]   Good question.
[01:46:04.220 --> 01:46:07.220]   I asked myself that over and over again.
[01:46:07.220 --> 01:46:08.220]   Okay.
[01:46:08.220 --> 01:46:10.220]   Like, why didn't I put this in last pass?
[01:46:10.220 --> 01:46:11.220]   I put everything else in last pass.
[01:46:11.220 --> 01:46:13.220]   I was using last pass.
[01:46:13.220 --> 01:46:16.220]   And what I realized is I probably used a password that I
[01:46:16.220 --> 01:46:18.220]   thought, Oh, this is a standard.
[01:46:18.220 --> 01:46:20.220]   I don't have to remember this.
[01:46:20.220 --> 01:46:21.220]   Okay.
[01:46:21.220 --> 01:46:22.220]   Right?
[01:46:22.220 --> 01:46:24.220]   So it's probably written on a piece of paper that's been
[01:46:24.220 --> 01:46:25.220]   frozen.
[01:46:25.220 --> 01:46:26.220]   It's in a freezer somewhere.
[01:46:26.220 --> 01:46:28.220]   You got to unfreeze it and then you'll have that password
[01:46:28.220 --> 01:46:29.220]   bank.
[01:46:29.220 --> 01:46:30.220]   I don't know what I was thinking.
[01:46:30.220 --> 01:46:31.220]   My son, my son is crazy.
[01:46:31.220 --> 01:46:32.220]   He's like, what happened?
[01:46:32.220 --> 01:46:34.220]   You lose your password.
[01:46:34.220 --> 01:46:37.220]   What do you think of this guys?
[01:46:37.220 --> 01:46:38.220]   You got to explain this to me.
[01:46:38.220 --> 01:46:43.220]   A new IBM robot held a debate with a human.
[01:46:43.220 --> 01:46:47.220]   And I think one, at least it did all right.
[01:46:47.220 --> 01:46:49.220]   It did all right.
[01:46:49.220 --> 01:46:50.220]   It did all right.
[01:46:50.220 --> 01:46:51.220]   It did all right.
[01:46:51.220 --> 01:46:54.220]   Project Debater made its public debut in San Francisco this
[01:46:54.220 --> 01:46:55.220]   week.
[01:46:55.220 --> 01:46:58.220]   It's squared off against Noah O'Vadia, who is no slouch.
[01:46:58.220 --> 01:47:01.220]   The 2016 Israeli debate champion.
[01:47:01.220 --> 01:47:05.220]   And then against another Israeli debater, Dan Zafreer.
[01:47:05.220 --> 01:47:09.220]   It turned out to be a formidable opponent scanning the
[01:47:09.220 --> 01:47:12.220]   hundreds of millions of newspaper and journal articles in its
[01:47:12.220 --> 01:47:16.220]   memory to quickly synthesize an argument on a topic in a
[01:47:16.220 --> 01:47:18.220]   position it was assigned on a spot.
[01:47:18.220 --> 01:47:20.220]   That's what happens in forensics, right?
[01:47:20.220 --> 01:47:22.220]   You don't get to choose your position.
[01:47:22.220 --> 01:47:23.220]   You don't get to choose your topic.
[01:47:23.220 --> 01:47:24.220]   You have to do it quickly.
[01:47:24.220 --> 01:47:29.220]   It's a five and a half foot skinny black rectangular screen.
[01:47:29.220 --> 01:47:30.220]   A monolith.
[01:47:30.220 --> 01:47:31.220]   Yeah.
[01:47:31.220 --> 01:47:34.220]   A monolith stands behind a podium just like a debater.
[01:47:34.220 --> 01:47:36.220]   I don't know if it has a voice.
[01:47:36.220 --> 01:47:38.220]   It's from 2001 space out of sea.
[01:47:38.220 --> 01:47:39.220]   Yeah.
[01:47:39.220 --> 01:47:40.220]   It's a...
[01:47:40.220 --> 01:47:45.220]   It looks for sentences and clauses.
[01:47:45.220 --> 01:47:48.220]   I want to see this in journals that are relevant to the topic.
[01:47:48.220 --> 01:47:53.220]   And then it's... they say it thinks, but obviously it doesn't
[01:47:53.220 --> 01:47:54.220]   think.
[01:47:54.220 --> 01:47:56.220]   It's not trained on topics though.
[01:47:56.220 --> 01:47:58.220]   It's trained on debate.
[01:47:58.220 --> 01:48:02.220]   It's interesting that it didn't respond to the
[01:48:02.220 --> 01:48:07.220]   contentions that she... I did debate during my secondary
[01:48:07.220 --> 01:48:08.220]   education.
[01:48:08.220 --> 01:48:14.220]   And like essentially the bot lost in the first... in the first
[01:48:14.220 --> 01:48:18.220]   instance because the whole thing about debate is someone puts
[01:48:18.220 --> 01:48:20.220]   forth these contentions, these arguments that they have.
[01:48:20.220 --> 01:48:23.220]   And then the job of the person who's coming against them is to
[01:48:23.220 --> 01:48:25.220]   refute those contentions.
[01:48:25.220 --> 01:48:28.220]   And there's a very simple concept that if those contentions
[01:48:28.220 --> 01:48:32.220]   aren't refuted, then its silence is acceptance.
[01:48:32.220 --> 01:48:34.220]   Meaning you didn't argue against...
[01:48:34.220 --> 01:48:35.220]   Oh.
[01:48:35.220 --> 01:48:37.220]   Therefore you accept what I've had to say.
[01:48:37.220 --> 01:48:40.220]   And it says in this article that the project bater was supposed
[01:48:40.220 --> 01:48:43.220]   to respond directly to those points but didn't rebut them
[01:48:43.220 --> 01:48:44.220]   directly.
[01:48:44.220 --> 01:48:48.220]   So it's not there yet, but I mean what AI is.
[01:48:48.220 --> 01:48:51.220]   Let's get Micah in the room with this thing.
[01:48:51.220 --> 01:48:52.220]   Yeah.
[01:48:52.220 --> 01:48:53.220]   Clearly.
[01:48:53.220 --> 01:48:57.220]   Mr. Forensics over here has got to get involved.
[01:48:57.220 --> 01:48:58.220]   Let's see.
[01:48:58.220 --> 01:49:00.220]   What else?
[01:49:00.220 --> 01:49:05.220]   Fortnite made $100 million in its first 90 days on iOS and that's
[01:49:05.220 --> 01:49:07.220]   for a free game.
[01:49:07.220 --> 01:49:12.220]   When you were talking about the gaming phone earlier, I was
[01:49:12.220 --> 01:49:16.220]   going to say that I have talked to many people who play this game
[01:49:16.220 --> 01:49:20.220]   on their phone, which blows my mind because I play it on a
[01:49:20.220 --> 01:49:23.220]   PlayStation 4 and get my butt handed to you.
[01:49:23.220 --> 01:49:24.220]   It's still got clobbered.
[01:49:24.220 --> 01:49:25.220]   Ever a single time.
[01:49:25.220 --> 01:49:26.220]   Yeah.
[01:49:26.220 --> 01:49:27.220]   Well, it's an amazing report.
[01:49:27.220 --> 01:49:29.220]   This and PUBG both have really good mobile versions.
[01:49:29.220 --> 01:49:30.220]   We've never seen that before.
[01:49:30.220 --> 01:49:33.220]   So now all of a sudden, yeah, the idea of a mobile gaming phone
[01:49:33.220 --> 01:49:35.220]   kind of makes sense too.
[01:49:35.220 --> 01:49:36.220]   Yeah.
[01:49:36.220 --> 01:49:37.220]   Yeah.
[01:49:37.220 --> 01:49:38.220]   The game is amazing though.
[01:49:38.220 --> 01:49:39.220]   I can't wait.
[01:49:39.220 --> 01:49:41.220]   They still haven't put out.
[01:49:41.220 --> 01:49:45.220]   Like the actual game hasn't come out yet, right?
[01:49:45.220 --> 01:49:47.220]   Is that why it's free?
[01:49:47.220 --> 01:49:48.220]   No, this is the model.
[01:49:48.220 --> 01:49:49.220]   This is it.
[01:49:49.220 --> 01:49:50.220]   This is it.
[01:49:50.220 --> 01:49:51.220]   This is printing money.
[01:49:51.220 --> 01:49:53.220]   But it's not freemium because you can't buy better weapons or
[01:49:53.220 --> 01:49:54.220]   better.
[01:49:54.220 --> 01:49:58.220]   You can only buy like funny outfits and dance moves, right?
[01:49:58.220 --> 01:50:00.220]   Are you serious and they've made $100 million?
[01:50:00.220 --> 01:50:01.220]   Yes!
[01:50:01.220 --> 01:50:02.220]   What?
[01:50:02.220 --> 01:50:03.220]   Yeah.
[01:50:03.220 --> 01:50:04.220]   You don't like to do that.
[01:50:04.220 --> 01:50:06.220]   You're not a dancer.
[01:50:06.220 --> 01:50:08.220]   No, of course I'm a dancer.
[01:50:08.220 --> 01:50:09.220]   A real life dancer.
[01:50:09.220 --> 01:50:10.220]   Not something in the game.
[01:50:10.220 --> 01:50:14.220]   I don't understand the appeal.
[01:50:14.220 --> 01:50:17.220]   What does one get by getting a dance move?
[01:50:17.220 --> 01:50:20.220]   Well, honestly, dancing I think is used as taunting.
[01:50:20.220 --> 01:50:21.220]   Yeah.
[01:50:21.220 --> 01:50:22.220]   So when you dance...
[01:50:22.220 --> 01:50:26.780]   When you go to your deathbed and you're lying there and it's like the last thing you get
[01:50:26.780 --> 01:50:31.180]   to say, it's not like someone's going to approach you and say, man, that dance you had in Fortnite
[01:50:31.180 --> 01:50:32.220]   that you paid five bucks for.
[01:50:32.220 --> 01:50:34.220]   I'll never forget it.
[01:50:34.220 --> 01:50:37.220]   It's just such a waste of money and...
[01:50:37.220 --> 01:50:39.220]   Welcome to mobile gaming.
[01:50:39.220 --> 01:50:42.780]   Do you feel like we're slowly edging our way into...
[01:50:42.780 --> 01:50:44.220]   If it's not in a yock or see it's wall-y.
[01:50:44.220 --> 01:50:45.220]   Yeah.
[01:50:45.220 --> 01:50:52.660]   We're slowly edging our way into some odd future where children will live their entire life
[01:50:52.660 --> 01:50:54.220]   in a floating chair and...
[01:50:54.220 --> 01:50:55.220]   I don't know.
[01:50:55.220 --> 01:50:58.980]   It feels like that's the goal of the entire tech industry right now.
[01:50:58.980 --> 01:51:03.220]   Like I'm looking at all the scooter startups and just thinking, man, just walk.
[01:51:03.220 --> 01:51:04.220]   I don't know.
[01:51:04.220 --> 01:51:08.220]   Some air chat room says it's literally a Tracy Ollman sketch.
[01:51:08.220 --> 01:51:09.220]   Yeah.
[01:51:09.220 --> 01:51:10.220]   Yeah.
[01:51:10.220 --> 01:51:13.220]   So get ready because the next big thing is esports.
[01:51:13.220 --> 01:51:15.500]   Professional video gamers are getting their own stadiums.
[01:51:15.500 --> 01:51:18.220]   This is a Wall Street Journal in Arlington, Texas.
[01:51:18.220 --> 01:51:22.460]   A 100,000 square foot arena for live video game competitions.
[01:51:22.460 --> 01:51:24.580]   We'll start construction soon.
[01:51:24.580 --> 01:51:26.540]   It's just one of many.
[01:51:26.540 --> 01:51:29.460]   Here is the esports stadium Arlington.
[01:51:29.460 --> 01:51:33.660]   It'll be a 30,000 square foot competition space.
[01:51:33.660 --> 01:51:37.540]   I think you guys have one out there in New York.
[01:51:37.540 --> 01:51:38.540]   There's one in Burbank.
[01:51:38.540 --> 01:51:40.100]   I think there's something.
[01:51:40.100 --> 01:51:41.100]   Yeah.
[01:51:41.100 --> 01:51:43.340]   All they need is good air circulation, please.
[01:51:43.340 --> 01:51:47.940]   Are you saying something about these guys not bathing regularly?
[01:51:47.940 --> 01:51:49.540]   Is that your implication?
[01:51:49.540 --> 01:51:50.540]   Just sweaty gamers.
[01:51:50.540 --> 01:51:56.660]   I used to manage a computer lab and I had to post signs like please, please just shower.
[01:51:56.660 --> 01:52:01.100]   Steve Jobs very famously didn't bathe because he thought his vegetarian diet kept him from
[01:52:01.100 --> 01:52:02.100]   smelling.
[01:52:02.100 --> 01:52:04.900]   He was the only one who thought that, by the way.
[01:52:04.900 --> 01:52:09.300]   This is why I stayed home and shop on Amazon.
[01:52:09.300 --> 01:52:16.740]   This is the 74,000 square foot Burbank, California arena built by Blizzard to play overwatch.
[01:52:16.740 --> 01:52:19.260]   People, fans come and stay as long as 24 hours.
[01:52:19.260 --> 01:52:22.700]   Some of these things last forever.
[01:52:22.700 --> 01:52:24.940]   That's not going to help with the smell.
[01:52:24.940 --> 01:52:29.220]   By the way, somebody in the chat room, faux pas says esports is not a thing.
[01:52:29.220 --> 01:52:30.220]   Stop saying it.
[01:52:30.220 --> 01:52:31.220]   It is a thing.
[01:52:31.220 --> 01:52:32.220]   It is a thing.
[01:52:32.220 --> 01:52:33.980]   They can build stadiums for it.
[01:52:33.980 --> 01:52:36.580]   If they can afford to build stadiums, it's a thing.
[01:52:36.580 --> 01:52:40.660]   Fortnite, the Fortnite developers, the ones we just said made 100 million on iOS, have
[01:52:40.660 --> 01:52:46.740]   said we're going to take that 100 million dollars and put it towards esports purses.
[01:52:46.740 --> 01:52:47.740]   Fortnite has taken off.
[01:52:47.740 --> 01:52:51.540]   If you look at Twitch, which used to be the League of Legends network, right?
[01:52:51.540 --> 01:52:56.820]   Fortnite easily beats League of Legends and everything else, including PUBG.
[01:52:56.820 --> 01:53:00.300]   Here's an arena in Vegas at the Luxor.
[01:53:00.300 --> 01:53:03.380]   This is an esports arena.
[01:53:03.380 --> 01:53:07.340]   They've actually opened six venues, the allied esports folks, since 2015.
[01:53:07.340 --> 01:53:09.340]   No, I think it's a thing.
[01:53:09.340 --> 01:53:12.660]   If it's not a thing, these people are throwing away their money.
[01:53:12.660 --> 01:53:14.940]   I think it's a thing.
[01:53:14.940 --> 01:53:15.940]   It's a thing.
[01:53:15.940 --> 01:53:19.300]   Honestly, it's kind of funny and exciting to watch, but you have to understand the game.
[01:53:19.300 --> 01:53:20.300]   That's the thing.
[01:53:20.300 --> 01:53:21.500]   It's a tough thing for anybody to just jump into.
[01:53:21.500 --> 01:53:24.700]   I think that's one of the reasons Fortnite is a good game for this.
[01:53:24.700 --> 01:53:26.180]   How hard is it to understand?
[01:53:26.180 --> 01:53:31.100]   100 people parachute into an island and the last man standing wins.
[01:53:31.100 --> 01:53:35.260]   There's a lot of little things going on that you may not understand, but it's fun to watch.
[01:53:35.260 --> 01:53:39.900]   I get waxed in the first five seconds every time.
[01:53:39.900 --> 01:53:43.220]   The nice thing is you can continue to watch.
[01:53:43.220 --> 01:53:44.220]   What's really fun?
[01:53:44.220 --> 01:53:46.100]   You watch the guy who killed you get killed.
[01:53:46.100 --> 01:53:47.980]   Then you watch the guy who killed him.
[01:53:47.980 --> 01:53:49.260]   Then you watch him get killed.
[01:53:49.260 --> 01:53:51.940]   Then you watch the guy who killed him.
[01:53:51.940 --> 01:53:55.380]   All the way to the guy who wins.
[01:53:55.380 --> 01:54:00.300]   Which is actually an inspired thing.
[01:54:00.300 --> 01:54:10.580]   Get ready because pretty soon it's going to be illegal to do memes in Europe.
[01:54:10.580 --> 01:54:14.420]   This may or may not come to fruition, but it is out of committee now and members of
[01:54:14.420 --> 01:54:18.180]   the European Parliament will be asked to vote on this in the next few months.
[01:54:18.180 --> 01:54:24.900]   It's a new European copyright law that would require online platforms like Facebook, but
[01:54:24.900 --> 01:54:29.100]   Reddit and even 4chan to censor content before it gets online.
[01:54:29.100 --> 01:54:33.860]   They'll have to have an automated content recognition system like YouTube has.
[01:54:33.860 --> 01:54:43.100]   If something like this grumpy cat is in an image or photo or music that's uploaded, they
[01:54:43.100 --> 01:54:44.100]   have to block it.
[01:54:44.100 --> 01:54:47.060]   You went too far, Europe.
[01:54:47.060 --> 01:54:48.060]   You went too far.
[01:54:48.060 --> 01:54:50.260]   You finally went too far.
[01:54:50.260 --> 01:54:51.340]   You excited.
[01:54:51.340 --> 01:54:56.740]   Article 13, which effectively deputizes social media and other internet companies to act
[01:54:56.740 --> 01:54:58.780]   as copyright police.
[01:54:58.780 --> 01:55:04.180]   A lot of people including Bruce Schneier, Vince Serf, Tim Berners-Lee, the electronic
[01:55:04.180 --> 01:55:08.460]   frontier foundation, Wiki Media and on and on and on are lobbying against it.
[01:55:08.460 --> 01:55:14.900]   The final form of the proposal went through committee in past on June 20th, but now I
[01:55:14.900 --> 01:55:18.180]   think it, let's see.
[01:55:18.180 --> 01:55:24.260]   The parliamentary plenary session will get to vote on it the week of July 4th or if it
[01:55:24.260 --> 01:55:28.060]   doesn't pass there than when the European Parliament returns from the summer recess
[01:55:28.060 --> 01:55:30.340]   in late September.
[01:55:30.340 --> 01:55:34.220]   Aren't memes inherently transformative?
[01:55:34.220 --> 01:55:35.220]   That's exactly right.
[01:55:35.220 --> 01:55:39.900]   Now, I know that sounds like a joke, but what you're saying is it's a fair use exemption.
[01:55:39.900 --> 01:55:40.900]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:55:40.900 --> 01:55:42.380]   That's transformative.
[01:55:42.380 --> 01:55:46.020]   But the problem with the content recognition systems as we know well is they don't understand
[01:55:46.020 --> 01:55:50.540]   transformative or parody or any of the fair use defenses.
[01:55:50.540 --> 01:55:52.460]   They just look and say, well, that's the same image.
[01:55:52.460 --> 01:55:56.420]   I know that image and block it.
[01:55:56.420 --> 01:55:57.420]   Yeah.
[01:55:57.420 --> 01:56:00.540]   I think somebody got Rick rolled really badly at some point.
[01:56:00.540 --> 01:56:05.540]   It was just like, ah, and the ball down.
[01:56:05.540 --> 01:56:10.300]   Corey Doctorow said it's collateral damage of protecting copyright that free expression,
[01:56:10.300 --> 01:56:15.980]   even legitimate free expression, commentary, criticism, parody will get hurt just as much
[01:56:15.980 --> 01:56:18.100]   as, you know, copyright violations.
[01:56:18.100 --> 01:56:19.100]   So pay attention.
[01:56:19.100 --> 01:56:21.620]   If you're in the EU, we're always saying this on the show.
[01:56:21.620 --> 01:56:24.340]   If you're in the United States, contact your member of Congress.
[01:56:24.340 --> 01:56:25.340]   Let them know how you feel.
[01:56:25.340 --> 01:56:28.740]   Well, now we can say if you're in the EU, contact your member of the European.
[01:56:28.740 --> 01:56:29.740]   Call the queen.
[01:56:29.740 --> 01:56:30.740]   Call the queen.
[01:56:30.740 --> 01:56:31.740]   Meme the queen.
[01:56:31.740 --> 01:56:32.740]   Meme the queen.
[01:56:32.740 --> 01:56:35.300]   I don't think that'll help anymore.
[01:56:35.300 --> 01:56:36.300]   Alright.
[01:56:36.300 --> 01:56:37.300]   Last topic of the day.
[01:56:37.300 --> 01:56:38.300]   What do you think?
[01:56:38.300 --> 01:56:40.420]   IGTV thumbs up, thumbs down.
[01:56:40.420 --> 01:56:43.380]   This is Instagram's new competitor to YouTube.
[01:56:43.380 --> 01:56:44.940]   It's going to feature.
[01:56:44.940 --> 01:56:52.220]   More long, as long as an hour videos on a dedicated app, what do you think?
[01:56:52.220 --> 01:56:56.500]   I'm mad about it so far because I've been getting notifications from people I do not
[01:56:56.500 --> 01:56:57.900]   care at all about.
[01:56:57.900 --> 01:57:00.660]   So go check out this IGTV video.
[01:57:00.660 --> 01:57:01.940]   No, thanks.
[01:57:01.940 --> 01:57:04.820]   You don't want to watch Roy Purdy get jiggy with it?
[01:57:04.820 --> 01:57:08.500]   I don't want to watch anybody get jiggy with anything.
[01:57:08.500 --> 01:57:12.300]   I think that's a fair rule.
[01:57:12.300 --> 01:57:13.300]   Yeah.
[01:57:13.300 --> 01:57:19.900]   I mean, in fairness, we may be outside of the core market here for Instagram, but it
[01:57:19.900 --> 01:57:21.900]   seems like the dumbest thing in the world.
[01:57:21.900 --> 01:57:25.100]   Like I don't know how many people are just going to sit there and watch one thing on
[01:57:25.100 --> 01:57:26.100]   Instagram.
[01:57:26.100 --> 01:57:28.740]   I think the joy of the app, you may spend an hour Instagram, but you're hopping between
[01:57:28.740 --> 01:57:31.300]   your friends and social media people and all different people.
[01:57:31.300 --> 01:57:32.620]   You're moving around.
[01:57:32.620 --> 01:57:36.380]   Sitting there and watching one video for an hour seems a bit much.
[01:57:36.380 --> 01:57:37.620]   Also it's vertical.
[01:57:37.620 --> 01:57:38.620]   Yeah.
[01:57:38.620 --> 01:57:39.620]   Yeah.
[01:57:39.620 --> 01:57:41.980]   I'm less mad about that.
[01:57:41.980 --> 01:57:46.500]   Like that I see so many people using their phones in that way and recording video in
[01:57:46.500 --> 01:57:50.420]   that way and so many platforms that make it easy to view video in that way.
[01:57:50.420 --> 01:57:51.420]   So that doesn't bother me.
[01:57:51.420 --> 01:57:57.620]   It's really just the fact that it's exclusive to these content creators that Instagram decides
[01:57:57.620 --> 01:58:04.340]   their content creators and the way that it's like seemingly trying to take on YouTube a
[01:58:04.340 --> 01:58:07.300]   little bit and it is not at all going to do that.
[01:58:07.300 --> 01:58:12.700]   And Instagram I think did a really good job with Instagram stories and made it this really
[01:58:12.700 --> 01:58:17.900]   easily accessible and sort of more premium version of Snapchat in a way that I'll obviously
[01:58:17.900 --> 01:58:20.300]   a lot of people use Instagram stories and really like it.
[01:58:20.300 --> 01:58:24.860]   And then it's just like, why do we have to throw in this other thing that makes this...
[01:58:24.860 --> 01:58:29.860]   I already sort of get sometimes annoyed by the quote unquote influencers that are on
[01:58:29.860 --> 01:58:32.620]   Instagram that I have to sort of scroll through at times.
[01:58:32.620 --> 01:58:34.300]   So I don't get this.
[01:58:34.300 --> 01:58:35.300]   Yeah.
[01:58:35.300 --> 01:58:36.300]   I agree.
[01:58:36.300 --> 01:58:38.500]   I completely agree with Mike especially the part about...
[01:58:38.500 --> 01:58:42.420]   And I didn't actually realize this so correct me if I'm wrong but the idea that they're
[01:58:42.420 --> 01:58:49.260]   trying to curate who gets in on the ground floor of this, like that seems super problematic
[01:58:49.260 --> 01:58:51.220]   if you're trying to take on YouTube for sure.
[01:58:51.220 --> 01:58:56.500]   The press really says IGTV is focused on the creators you love most and already follow
[01:58:56.500 --> 01:58:58.700]   on Instagram.
[01:58:58.700 --> 01:59:02.980]   You can upload it but will it get featured and will anybody see it?
[01:59:02.980 --> 01:59:07.780]   I don't even like the Instagram stories although obviously I am out of date on that because
[01:59:07.780 --> 01:59:10.340]   that seems to be very successful.
[01:59:10.340 --> 01:59:13.780]   One of the things they said at this announcement is Instagram now has 1 billion monthly active
[01:59:13.780 --> 01:59:14.780]   users.
[01:59:14.780 --> 01:59:23.140]   God you feel for people like PUBG and Snapchat who invent something, they create something
[01:59:23.140 --> 01:59:27.380]   that's awesome and then along comes somebody copies what they're doing exactly and takes
[01:59:27.380 --> 01:59:29.060]   all the audience away.
[01:59:29.060 --> 01:59:32.820]   I guess my space has to go on that list as well.
[01:59:32.820 --> 01:59:36.180]   I guess that's the way it is.
[01:59:36.180 --> 01:59:40.620]   Certainly we wouldn't try to create content specifically for IGTV.
[01:59:40.620 --> 01:59:43.220]   On the other hand we're very happy to be on YouTube.
[01:59:43.220 --> 01:59:47.340]   Alright you guys qualify you can all pour your brains into a vat.
[01:59:47.340 --> 01:59:49.180]   You're all too old.
[01:59:49.180 --> 01:59:51.020]   You're all too old.
[01:59:51.020 --> 01:59:52.020]   Yes.
[01:59:52.020 --> 01:59:55.220]   Hey thank you all for being here.
[01:59:55.220 --> 02:00:01.220]   I know everybody wants to go because it's Westworld the last episode tonight and you just

[02:00:05.820 --> 02:00:06.820]   You got your boots on.
[02:00:06.820 --> 02:00:07.820]   You're ready.
[02:00:07.820 --> 02:00:11.860]   Boots are on just going to go on that cowboy hat right away on a horse to the.
[02:00:11.860 --> 02:00:17.620]   There's no crumbs under my keyboard.
[02:00:17.620 --> 02:00:21.620]   You'll find Michael Sergeant at Mobile Nations he writes for would you write for more than
[02:00:21.620 --> 02:00:25.860]   I'm warned you write for mall or I mostly write for I'm or but occasionally show up on
[02:00:25.860 --> 02:00:29.020]   Android Central more than any of the other ones that we have.
[02:00:29.020 --> 02:00:31.420]   Tell me about your podcast.
[02:00:31.420 --> 02:00:35.220]   Alright I'll tell you about my podcast I've been sharing this one so I'll just continue
[02:00:35.220 --> 02:00:40.300]   talk about it's a podcast called Lucid you can go to lucid.show it is a sleep science
[02:00:40.300 --> 02:00:46.260]   and dream interpretation podcast so we have listeners send in their dreams and my paltory
[02:00:46.260 --> 02:00:53.060]   folk and I will actually interpret the dream interpret the dreams on the show it's a lot
[02:00:53.060 --> 02:00:58.460]   of fun you get to learn a lot about sleep and everything surrounding sleep so be sure to
[02:00:58.460 --> 02:01:03.900]   check it out lucid.show you know we got I really like it it's only $60 on an Amazon
[02:01:03.900 --> 02:01:08.780]   certa sells this thing called a sleep tracker actually found out about it from Philippe con
[02:01:08.780 --> 02:01:13.740]   because he is motion actually invented this it go it's a little thing that goes under your
[02:01:13.740 --> 02:01:17.620]   mattress you can have one for each side of two people sure about and then every morning
[02:01:17.620 --> 02:01:20.780]   it tells us our sleep score and Lisa I noticed we really pay an attention to that tells you
[02:01:20.780 --> 02:01:25.580]   how much REM sleep that's the dreaming sleep how much deep sleep light sleep how many times
[02:01:25.580 --> 02:01:29.220]   you got up if you got up things like that and I find that really fascinating and I'm
[02:01:29.220 --> 02:01:34.620]   wondering I bet you there be some way to use that to trigger lucid dreaming or something
[02:01:34.620 --> 02:01:38.620]   I don't know yeah yeah I mean because lucid dreaming is going to happen when you're in
[02:01:38.620 --> 02:01:42.380]   your rim sleep and it knows when you're in REM sleep right so yeah so if it could if
[02:01:42.380 --> 02:01:46.220]   it could create a sound like a lot of people try to tie it to a sound or too light that
[02:01:46.220 --> 02:01:50.660]   sort of shines on their eyes and that helps you sort of realize that you're in in that
[02:01:50.660 --> 02:01:54.900]   stage of sleep there's a lot to rim sleep that's really interesting so check out the podcast
[02:01:54.900 --> 02:01:57.900]   you'll learn a lot more about rim and I want to I'm going to talk to Philippe and see if
[02:01:57.900 --> 02:02:02.460]   there's some way that he can modify this so that because it I don't know how it knows
[02:02:02.460 --> 02:02:06.020]   but it knows when you're in REM sleep how would it know yeah do you mean you're right
[02:02:06.020 --> 02:02:10.900]   is different breathing is different okay it's all tied to your yeah your respiration and
[02:02:10.900 --> 02:02:15.180]   circulation as it tracks heart rate and breath rate it knows I don't know how but somehow
[02:02:15.180 --> 02:02:17.940]   it knows respiration and heart rate and the fitness trackers have been doing that for
[02:02:17.940 --> 02:02:23.380]   a while like since drop on some of the earlier fit bits yeah so like what is it like the
[02:02:23.380 --> 02:02:27.620]   trigger would be just a sound and I would just get trained to that sound and then no
[02:02:27.620 --> 02:02:31.900]   exactly oh yeah I'm dreaming and then within your dream you recognize your dreaming now
[02:02:31.900 --> 02:02:36.500]   you're lucid dreaming yes exactly and there are plenty of little tutorials online that
[02:02:36.500 --> 02:02:40.740]   walk you through the process of learning what your sound or your light you know feedback
[02:02:40.740 --> 02:02:48.380]   is yeah or you could just take ambient this is true we just did an episode on ambient
[02:02:48.380 --> 02:02:52.260]   there's a there's a Reddit thread that everyone should check out or read it I don't know what
[02:02:52.260 --> 02:02:56.380]   they're called but you can read about people's experience yeah it's actually a Reddit subreddit
[02:02:56.380 --> 02:03:02.540]   called things you did on ambient yeah some Reddit slash r slash ambient things come for
[02:03:02.540 --> 02:03:10.420]   the cats stay for the empathy it says I you know what I have some stories I'm gonna leave
[02:03:10.420 --> 02:03:19.740]   it at that things I would never have done awake like this show Ben Brock Johnson he is

[02:03:49.020 --> 02:03:55.300]   Bob Oakes all boats yeah Ben what do you want to plug oh man I have a podcast you and
[02:03:55.300 --> 02:04:03.020]   it's about Reddit so that seems like no it's perfect yeah yeah it's a endless thread we
[02:04:03.020 --> 02:04:09.020]   we don't do dream stuff yet or we haven't done dream stuff yet we just did an episode
[02:04:09.020 --> 02:04:16.540]   about this axe murderer in New Orleans who who said this is from a Reddit thread obviously
[02:04:16.540 --> 02:04:22.340]   all of our stories come from Reddit threads and this one this guy wrote the Times Picky
[02:04:22.340 --> 02:04:28.380]   Eun in 1919 I think it was and said I'm gonna kill a bunch of people but I'm not gonna kill
[02:04:28.380 --> 02:04:36.860]   anybody where jazz is being played and for one night in 1919 apparently was like the biggest
[02:04:36.860 --> 02:04:42.940]   night of jazz in in in all of New Orleans at the time is in the era is until that time
[02:04:42.940 --> 02:04:48.780]   New Orleans was known for classical music well it is funny we talk about this in the episode
[02:04:48.780 --> 02:04:53.900]   it's nor jazz was sort of struggling in the city at the time and there were people writing
[02:04:53.900 --> 02:04:59.100]   editorials saying that New Orleans should should sort of deny that it was the place where jazz
[02:04:59.100 --> 02:05:05.420]   started and and they had just shut down the red light district relatively recently in the city
[02:05:05.420 --> 02:05:09.660]   and there was a lot of jazz happening there so the episode actually talks about this the
[02:05:09.660 --> 02:05:16.060]   jazz was believe it or not struggling at the time in New Orleans and this this this random
[02:05:16.060 --> 02:05:23.580]   letter letter supposedly from the axe murderer helped to bring bring the genre back to the city
[02:05:23.580 --> 02:05:30.460]   this is why I love that TIL subreddit this I learned or today I learned because there's always
[02:05:30.460 --> 02:05:35.020]   great stuff in there I make sure that's one of my subscribed subreddits I love it that's great
[02:05:35.020 --> 02:05:39.420]   yeah thank you so much Ben great to have you of course to vendor hard war he's a senior editor

[02:05:59.420 --> 02:06:03.900]   weeks earlier um saw with a whole bunch of school kids it's still pretty dumb
[02:06:04.540 --> 02:06:10.940]   uh but this guy is a much better director than the last uh director yeah I mean my problem is
[02:06:10.940 --> 02:06:15.740]   Chris Pratt I love him they don't know what to do with that character like he's just literally
[02:06:15.740 --> 02:06:20.620]   just handsome action guy yeah he's like an action figure she was so good and parks and rec
[02:06:20.620 --> 02:06:27.900]   yeah and then he got uh I don't know he got one of them solo gym things and yeah and suddenly he's
[02:06:27.900 --> 02:06:33.260]   like an action figure yeah but they yeah they don't know what to do with him yeah seems like that
