[00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.200]   Bandwidth for this weekend tech is provided by
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.480]   AOL Radio at AOL.com/podcasting.

[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.320]   This is Twit, this weekend tech.
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.560]   Episode 77 for November 19th, 2006.
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.400]   Kiss my ring.
[00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.520]   This weekend tech is brought to you by Dell.
[00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.840]   Visit Leo's Fix for some great deals on Dell,
[00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.760]   desktops and laptops at twit.tv/dell.
[00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:54.920]   [ Music ]
[00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.840]   A Sunday afternoon and what does that mean?
[00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.880]   It means it's time to twit with the grace of God
[00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:01.960]   and the wind in our sails.
[00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.160]   We have a panel of four starting with John C. Devorak.org/blog
[00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.560]   who is somehow, somebody sent me a note, what was it?
[00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.120]   Oh shoot, now I can't remember about you and--
[00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.880]   >> So it wasn't plugging the blog enough?
[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.480]   >> I think it was something like that.
[00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.280]   >> Yeah, I've been getting complaints on cranky geeks
[00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.080]   because I'm supposed to do that.
[00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.200]   I guess there's a drinking contest I think out there.
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.520]   >> I don't know what it is.
[00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.200]   >> They're a little annoyed by the fact they're not saying
[00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.160]   vork.org/blog enough.
[00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.240]   >> Sorry, the wild turkey went down the runway, hold on.
[00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.560]   Will Harris is here from bit-tech.net to correct me
[00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.280]   and I'm glad to have you on, Will.
[00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.120]   >> Hey, how's it going?
[00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.240]   >> Whenever I say something about Intel, I hear from Will.
[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.760]   And Bill McCrone, who is kindly sent to join the panel,
[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.320]   hasn't been on since-- and I can tell this
[00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.920]   because there is a new entry in Wikipedia about us.
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.840]   You haven't been on since episode 69, it says here.
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.160]   >> That's kind of scary.
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.160]   >> You were on 48, 60, and 69.
[00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.520]   Well, you know, this is weird.
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.960]   The entry is-- and Will Harris brought this to our attention.
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.080]   This week in tech panelists in Wikipedia,
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.600]   everybody who's ever appeared on this week in tech,
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.480]   along with the episode number, including obscure people
[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.880]   like the captain on the cruise ship, who was just basically
[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.440]   an incidental appearance.
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.800]   >> Boy, somebody's got way too much time on their hands.
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.080]   >> Well, this saves me time.
[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.440]   >> Wikipedia is really scaring me these days.
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.280]   [laughter]
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.200]   >> You know, Wikipedia is now banned in China, and I think
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.200]   it has something to do with this entry.
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.840]   That's all I can say.
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.600]   >> Well, that brings me-- I'm sorry, but that brings me
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.120]   to a story that we're going to probably cover eventually.
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:49.000]   >> But my blog has been banned, apparently, in the UAE.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.920]   >> Well, it's about time.
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.200]   Is that because you show the faces of women without veils?
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.560]   >> You know, I think we're trying to figure out exactly
[00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.480]   what triggered it, and we also need to get it confirmed.
[00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.680]   It's only-- we have a fan in the UAE.
[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.080]   >> Is it a-- is it a-- that's the United Arab Emirates, by the way.
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.680]   Is it a-- like a government filter that's blocked?
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.680]   >> Yeah, yeah, that's what this guy says.
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.280]   He says the whole-- he says he had-- this is a real problem
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.120]   in the UAE.
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.560]   There's a filter mechanism somewhere.
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.200]   He says, "Then you can't do anything about it.
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.760]   You don't know who to complain to, and once it's in place,
[00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.720]   you know, there's not-- he's been--
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.080]   because he's got other sites that apparently have been
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.920]   cut off.
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.560]   You know, people always mowin' and groan about China,
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.440]   but nobody ever talks about this.
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.880]   But anyway, once I get it confirmed, I'll start lookin' into it.
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.840]   But I think it was because we did some stories
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.440]   on the protests of certain Muslim women
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.240]   that were-- they're protesting these--
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.440]   who do rape laws that were trying--
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.400]   there were some of us trying to get them--
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.840]   you know, there's a bunch of these weird laws
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.640]   in some of these Muslim countries that are so not particular.
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.080]   >> You don't think it's about sex.
[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.960]   It's just--
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.160]   >> No, we don't have-- we don't do our blog.
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.760]   >> It's not the first time you've been blocked.
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:55.600]   >> Right.
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.480]   >> We've been blocked once before, but we don't do any sex,
[00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.680]   but we've never had bare breasts on the show,
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.240]   or the show on the--
[00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.680]   >> No, we've had 'em on the show.
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:03.920]   We've never had 'em on the blog.
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:04.760]   That's right.
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:05.600]   >> We've never had 'em on the blog.
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:06.680]   >> They're very effective on podcasts.
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.680]   >> And they're very good on podcasts.
[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.520]   And so we don't-- and we don't do a lot of--
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.720]   you know, they do a lot of dirty jokes or anything like that,
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.400]   but there's a-- you know, our bloggers,
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.720]   they do a lot of political stuff,
[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.920]   and this-- we had a run on Muslim related stuff,
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.520]   and I think they-- you know, somebody didn't want--
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:22.760]   interesting, interesting.
[00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.720]   >> But we need somebody-- if there's a listener out there
[00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.880]   in the UAE, I would like to get some confirmation on this
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:28.720]   if they could help me out.
[00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.400]   >> Presuming that the podcast has not been blocked.
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.360]   >> You know, I don't-- I think you may have heard by now
[00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.320]   'cause your podcast--
[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:37.360]   >> We have listeners all over.
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.200]   I know-- >> Listeners.
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.040]   >> Yeah, and they're all nuts.
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.480]   They're all-- I'm sorry, I didn't use the right word.
[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:42.680]   They're all fanatics.
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.120]   >> Fanatics, they would be the word, yes.
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.360]   There-- >> So you would have heard.
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.520]   >> We have the "twint fundamentalists" out there,
[00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.800]   and obviously whoever compiled this Wikipedia entry
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.080]   is one of them.
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.000]   So the big story, and it's-- people have been bugging me
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.400]   'cause we didn't cover it last week, and I really--
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.840]   and we will cover it in greater depth.
[00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.080]   In fact, we've asked even Mowglen to come back on Floss,
[00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.800]   our open source podcast to talk about it.
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.920]   He's the lawyer for the Free Software Foundation
[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:11.040]   and the guy responsible for GPL 2 and 3.
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.800]   But the deal is that apparently there was a deal--
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.280]   apparently it's public knowledge--
[00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:20.280]   there was a deal between novel and Microsoft over Linux.
[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:24.040]   Novel publishes the very popular SUSA Linux,
[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:29.040]   and Microsoft made a deal with them that, oddly enough,
[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:35.240]   SUSA says, "Now indemnifies users of our Linux
[00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.640]   "against lawsuit."
[00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:41.560]   The agreements are in place till 2012.
[00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.640]   There's money-- it's a money deal,
[00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:46.840]   although we don't know how much,
[00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:50.240]   and Microsoft also will buy 70,000 copies of Novel's.
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.240]   Linux Enterprise Server.
[00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.240]   I don't know what Microsoft's gonna do with that.
[00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.080]   And they're gonna do a joint research facility
[00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.640]   that focuses on interoperability,
[00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:01.800]   but I think the key to it really is
[00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:05.320]   is key to indemnify SUSA customers.
[00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.160]   And now the other shoe dropped this week
[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:10.680]   when Steve Ballmer said he believes that Linux
[00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.760]   infringes on Microsoft's patents.
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:14.880]   Is that possible?
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:18.040]   Well, this is-- it's really interesting
[00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:20.440]   because I think that the root of this
[00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:23.480]   is the fact that Microsoft has its new
[00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.640]   sort of virtualization technology coming up
[00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:28.960]   in Windows long-horned server,
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:32.400]   and it wants to be able to offer its own customers
[00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.840]   the ability to run virtual Linux
[00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:36.680]   within the Windows server environment.
[00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:39.600]   So that is basically, I think, the premise of the deal.
[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:45.200]   You know, I think also Microsoft owns--
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:46.800]   or was supporting the SCO lawsuits.
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.120]   I think this goes back to the SCO lawsuits is what this is.
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.680]   This is basically that SCO lawsuit
[00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.360]   rearing its ugly ahead again.
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:56.760]   In the abbey?
[00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:59.840]   I'm sorry, but one of the problems they have here
[00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:03.480]   is they're gonna butt up against IBM with this tactic.
[00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:04.320]   And I don't think that--
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:05.320]   Well, it depends where the code is.
[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:07.440]   I don't know that nobody's saying--
[00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:10.240]   Ballmer's saying, well, there's an infringing code,
[00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:12.680]   but not showing you where the code is.
[00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:16.880]   Novel says in its FAQ on its website on the agreement,
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:19.720]   novel makes no admission that it's Linux
[00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:21.640]   and open source offerings of fringe
[00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:23.800]   on any other party's patents.
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:28.280]   However, Microsoft General Counsel Brad Smith says,
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:31.200]   we addressed the proprietary issues
[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:33.120]   through the net upfront payment,
[00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:34.800]   the open source we addressed through the percentage
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:38.200]   of revenue, in other words, it's a settlement.
[00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:42.240]   It's a-- That's weird. It's a settlement.
[00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:44.640]   Well, it is in terms, but what's interesting is
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:46.960]   it almost goes the other way.
[00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:49.000]   All the reports which are coming out from people
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   who have seen the deal and some of the legal professors
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.400]   that have worked on it saying that Microsoft has paid up
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:57.480]   to $350 million to make this happen.
[00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:59.280]   Microsoft?
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:00.120]   Well, that--
[00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:01.440]   Microsoft has paid.
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:04.480]   'Cause I thought the money was going the other direction.
[00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:05.840]   No, well, that's interesting.
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:08.840]   Isn't novel giving Microsoft a percentage of revenue
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:12.120]   to prevent Microsoft from suing ASUS customers?
[00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:13.120]   Isn't that what's happening?
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:16.760]   Well, it's about novel and Microsoft entering
[00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:20.040]   this wide-ranging agreement.
[00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:22.240]   Under the agreement, it's basically they want to work together,
[00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:24.480]   distribute Linux to Microsoft customers,
[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:27.280]   all these different things, and part of that is,
[00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:31.720]   Microsoft will say that we're not going to sue Linux,
[00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:35.280]   we're not going to sue Nevel for any infringements
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:38.240]   that may be in the code there,
[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:41.600]   now for which Nevel is paying a paltry sort of 30
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:44.320]   to 40 million for that part of the bargain,
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:46.880]   but the overall deal is with about 400 million
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:47.720]   in the other direction.
[00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:49.600]   The main flow is that way.
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:51.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.120]   Hard to believe that--
[00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:55.840]   Bomber says Linux users owe Microsoft money.
[00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:59.080]   Hey, wait a minute, it will?
[00:08:59.080 --> 00:08:59.920]   Yeah. It will?
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:01.560]   It's your accent getting worse?
[00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:03.960]   (laughing)
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.960]   Sorry, I just wondered.
[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:06.800]   (laughing)
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:10.320]   This is John's way of deflecting what he considers
[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:11.680]   a boring subject.
[00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:12.840]   No, no, I'm just wondering.
[00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:15.760]   Microsoft apparently made it a similar offer to Red Hat,
[00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:17.280]   which said no.
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:18.600]   Good for them.
[00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:20.360]   You know, we're going to talk to even Mooglin,
[00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:21.720]   and the reason is this looks like,
[00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:26.000]   if Nevel pays a royalty to Microsoft
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.360]   to cover patent infringement,
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:29.240]   it would be a violation of the GPL.
[00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:31.080]   And that's a big deal,
[00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:34.480]   because if Sosa is suddenly in violation of the GPL,
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:38.640]   well, I don't know what happens, but it's not good.
[00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:41.120]   This is the one of the top, if not the top,
[00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:42.560]   Linux is out there.
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:44.080]   Well, a lot of developers will drop it.
[00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:45.000]   They absolutely.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.840]   In fact, they probably already are considering it.
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:48.600]   My real question is,
[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:50.080]   and it's something that we can't address.
[00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:52.200]   And I think one of the reasons we didn't address it last week
[00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:53.800]   is it's so complicated.
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:55.080]   And then you've just pointed out,
[00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:57.440]   which way is the money going?
[00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:00.160]   We need more study on this.
[00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:01.880]   Yeah, Stephen would not come on.
[00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:02.680]   I tried to get even on,
[00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:03.680]   and he wouldn't come on.
[00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:06.240]   And T says I have to read this in greater detail.
[00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:08.600]   There's a quote from him on Tech News World, actually.
[00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:11.680]   I think yesterday it was put up,
[00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:15.480]   which was saying that, where's the quote?
[00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:17.760]   "Mogland made the case that Navell may give up
[00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:20.080]   his right to distribute Susie Linux,
[00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:21.880]   covered under the GPL license,
[00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:23.800]   if the company limits in any way the subsequent
[00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:26.240]   distribution of GPL software by users."
[00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:30.320]   Oh, it's really, really complicated.
[00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:33.560]   Does anybody perhaps suspect that this is just a,
[00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:34.840]   you know, Microsoft trying to,
[00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:36.480]   you know, a lot of people believe
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:38.800]   that they were trying to confuse things earlier,
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:40.240]   just to make enough people out there
[00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:42.600]   who have to make a decision, worry about it.
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.200]   It's fun.
[00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:45.360]   Well, and this is, you know,
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:46.960]   Microsoft apparently supported,
[00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:49.800]   now this is, we talked about this in Twitter three
[00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:50.640]   or something.
[00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:53.400]   I mean, Microsoft gave money to SCO for its lawsuits.
[00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:56.920]   And now, you know,
[00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:58.240]   Steve Ballmer saying,
[00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:00.560]   Linux, I'm quoting him,
[00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:03.520]   uses our patented intellectual property.
[00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:07.240]   And our shareholders expect us to protect or license
[00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:09.800]   to get an economic benefit.
[00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:10.960]   So this is what we're doing.
[00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:12.360]   We want Susie Linux to,
[00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:13.760]   now here's a great one.
[00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:15.840]   This is Steve Ballmer.
[00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:16.960]   I don't know if he's throwing chairs
[00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:19.000]   and jumping up and down at the time when he said this,
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.440]   but we want Susie Linux to have the highest percentage
[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:24.560]   share of that because only a customer who,
[00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:27.000]   only a customer, my emphasis,
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.480]   who has Susie Linux actually has paid properly
[00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:33.120]   for the use of intellectual property from Microsoft.
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:35.400]   I'm appalled.
[00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:36.480]   But there is, right.
[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:40.920]   There's this argument that licensing patented,
[00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:43.320]   licensing patented stuff.
[00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:44.160]   Well, that breaks the GPU.
[00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:45.000]   It may violate the GPU.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.280]   Well, the question is,
[00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:48.200]   Mommer's asserting that there's,
[00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:51.720]   there's proprietary Microsoft stuff in Linux.
[00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:53.200]   Probably the DOS prompt.
[00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:55.720]   (laughs)
[00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:59.680]   Speaking of, there's an odds on possibility
[00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:03.160]   that the software patents won't hold up too.
[00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:05.520]   There have been so many bogus software patents
[00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:09.280]   granted over the last five to seven years.
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:14.280]   Well, maybe Microsoft Nival is the new NTP rim.
[00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:16.520]   (laughs)
[00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:18.360]   Terrifying to feel that.
[00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:20.160]   Well, I mean, SCO looked like that for a long time.
[00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:21.600]   I don't even know what happened.
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:24.520]   That just kind of dwindled away at that SCO lawsuit.
[00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:28.520]   Well, I think they were intimidated by IBM's lawyers
[00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:29.440]   into non-existent--
[00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:30.680]   Yeah, where's IBM in all this?
[00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:34.400]   I mean, why is an IBM saying something about this?
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:37.040]   Because they're saying we've got AIX
[00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:39.360]   and we've got more lawyers than you two.
[00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:41.040]   We don't care, that's right.
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:41.880]   Exactly.
[00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:42.720]   Yeah.
[00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:44.520]   Well, again, it's one of those things
[00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:45.480]   where there's something going on.
[00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:47.800]   It's hard to say exactly what is going on.
[00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:52.080]   Bear's watching.
[00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:53.080]   Yeah, there you go.
[00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:53.920]   Only time.
[00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:56.080]   The traditional closeout for a reporter
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:57.960]   who has no idea what he's talking about.
[00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:00.080]   Only time will tell.
[00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:01.360]   Stay tuned.
[00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:03.360]   Stay tuned.
[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:04.200]   I love that.
[00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.360]   You'll see it all the time in local.
[00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:06.360]   Time will tell.
[00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:08.080]   Only time will tell.
[00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:08.920]   Right.
[00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:11.280]   Queen of England has, I don't know if it's a night.
[00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:12.360]   What do you call it?
[00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:14.800]   Honored Jonathan Ives who is a British subject
[00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:18.640]   for his design of the iPod and the iMac.
[00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:20.000]   He's giving him the CB.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.320]   CBE.
[00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:23.280]   What does that mean?
[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:24.880]   That's a common one, isn't it?
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:26.160]   His command of a British iPod.
[00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:27.760]   Yeah, you're not a knight.
[00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:28.920]   You're not a knight or anything like that.
[00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:29.920]   He's a star.
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:30.920]   He's a star.
[00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:33.920]   No, no, it's just, it's rather below that,
[00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:35.920]   but it's good for people who do quite good works.
[00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:37.920]   Quite good work.
[00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:39.320]   So good for John.
[00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:40.640]   Is it a prelude?
[00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:43.200]   I mean, is it like a lieutenant so he could be promoted up?
[00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:45.040]   Or is it just something?
[00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:48.800]   Well, sometimes you go, I think it's CBE.
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:50.960]   Then MBE is master.
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:52.960]   Then OBE is something.
[00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:54.880]   And then OBE is one below.
[00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:55.880]   So...
[00:13:55.880 --> 00:14:00.120]   I think it felt like John could be a sir.
[00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:01.920]   Jonathan Ives can be a sir.
[00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:02.920]   I mean, every...
[00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:05.400]   Yeah, the Bill Gates is a nice...
[00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:06.400]   He's an honorary sir.
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:08.480]   You can't call him Sir Bill though.
[00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:11.240]   The difference is is the...
[00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:14.760]   How much income you bring in and how much taxes you pay.
[00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:15.760]   Oh, that's a good point.
[00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:19.240]   So you get Sir Paul McCartney because he's worth a half a billion dollars, you know,
[00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:21.760]   and then I guess his wife will be a sir next.
[00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:24.480]   Who, Bill or Paul?
[00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:25.480]   Paul.
[00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:26.480]   They got divorced.
[00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:27.480]   He dumped her.
[00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:29.680]   Well, I don't know, but she's gonna still pay taxes.
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:31.080]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:33.880]   She does get a lot of the fortune, doesn't it?
[00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:38.200]   So the Zoom came out this week to a resounding snore.
[00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:41.240]   We talked about it last week and pretty much concluded that anybody who bought it would
[00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:42.240]   be insane.
[00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:45.160]   Hey, so I saw one.
[00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:47.200]   We played with it on the Cranky Geek show.
[00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:48.200]   It's nice.
[00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:49.200]   And I like it.
[00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:50.200]   I like how it feels.
[00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:53.720]   I like the whole thing except for the brown color, but even that doesn't bother me that
[00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:54.720]   much.
[00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:55.720]   It's brown.
[00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:56.720]   Flush it.
[00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:57.720]   I mean, it's the thing.
[00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:58.720]   But I agree with you.
[00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:02.040]   I'm with you on the user interface, the form factor.
[00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:03.360]   I think it's a nice device.
[00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:05.280]   The video looks better on it.
[00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:08.280]   It's the copy protection that's scaring people away.
[00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:09.680]   And the point system.
[00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:14.680]   Yeah, I heard that, well, I don't have one obviously because they're not gonna send
[00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:15.680]   me one.
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:22.160]   But my understanding is that if you transfer, if I have a real MP3 file that I happened
[00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:28.400]   to do myself, rip myself, and I send it to you on your Zoom, it adds copy protection
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:29.400]   to it.
[00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:30.840]   The violation of our license.
[00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:32.920]   What is that all about?
[00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:35.880]   It's just being safe.
[00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:38.920]   You can only play it three times.
[00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:40.720]   Yeah, it's great.
[00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:43.920]   And you can't use the Wi-Fi to like buy it if you want to buy it.
[00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:45.920]   You can't use the Wi-Fi for that.
[00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:49.800]   I think one of the interesting things that came out this week is now people have actually
[00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:54.520]   got their handle and it's at the battery life for videos worse than the iPod.
[00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:56.480]   Which is silly because it's a bigger device.
[00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:58.120]   The iPod one isn't great either.
[00:15:58.120 --> 00:15:59.960]   Yeah, and it's a huge device.
[00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:03.520]   What are we getting in that big box if we're not getting a bigger battery?
[00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:09.000]   You know, I wonder if somebody's gonna crack that thing sooner than later and be able to
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.160]   get rid of some of that DRM that's in there.
[00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:13.520]   Why isn't there a Smash My Zoom site?
[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:15.720]   There's a Smash My PS3 site.
[00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:16.960]   Right, I saw that.
[00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:18.800]   I don't see anybody taking a sledgehammer to the Zoom.
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:21.760]   Well, maybe because it's so common.
[00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:24.600]   It's not nothing special about doing that.
[00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:28.600]   It's crazy to smash a PS3 though.
[00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:31.400]   That is crazy, but it was good theater.
[00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:36.600]   You know, maybe it's just me, but I cringe when I look at that video.
[00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:37.600]   I like video.
[00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:40.000]   And all of those people who had waited online 18 hours.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.040]   Oh yeah, they did it in the parking lot.
[00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:45.440]   Yeah, right in front of the Best Buy line.
[00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:47.960]   Hey, one of my favorite stories about that.
[00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:51.960]   You know, of course, everybody that was interviewed that was standing in line for these places
[00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:56.160]   were there for the same reason, so they could resell the things on the base of it.
[00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:58.160]   Nobody's keeping it, which is not a good thing.
[00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:03.520]   But the story I heard is about back east is a guy who hired a bunch of homeless people.
[00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:04.520]   The dentist.
[00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:08.920]   And then put a hundred of them in line and got as many of these things as he could, fed
[00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:11.360]   them and gave them each a hundred bucks.
[00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:12.360]   Good deal.
[00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:13.360]   He's doing good works.
[00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:15.880]   I don't know if that was the dentist.
[00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:19.240]   There was a dentist who put, I think his whole dental office was waiting in line for him,
[00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:20.240]   his employees.
[00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:24.160]   You know, this guy, there's some sharp operator that just grabbed a bunch of people off.
[00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:25.720]   Nobody was waiting in line for the Zoom.
[00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:26.720]   That's the good news.
[00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:28.920]   You can just walk right up and get one.
[00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:29.920]   Yeah.
[00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:36.160]   The interesting thing was that all of the mail I've gotten this week is about personal
[00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:41.080]   audio players says simply, does the new little shuffle sound as good as the old shuffle?
[00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:42.080]   It does too, doesn't it?
[00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:45.840]   I mean, that's one of the things you've done that I really like is you've tested the
[00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:46.840]   audio on these.
[00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:48.680]   And I know you like the old iPods.
[00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:50.360]   The shuffle's good.
[00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:51.520]   The shuffle is superb.
[00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:54.200]   The first shuffle was the best of all of them, right?
[00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:55.560]   Yes, absolutely.
[00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:57.160]   And the new one is as good?
[00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:58.160]   Yeah.
[00:17:58.160 --> 00:17:59.160]   Interesting.
[00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:02.240]   That's the amazing, well, they're using the same technology.
[00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:04.640]   Oh, so shrinking it didn't...
[00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:08.960]   Shrinking it helps because they can't put the evil capacitors in there that they put
[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:13.080]   in the regular iPods.
[00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:21.560]   No one, no audio engineer, no electronic designer that I've spoken with can figure out why
[00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:26.280]   Apple took the low road on the other iPods.
[00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:27.560]   What does the capacitor do?
[00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:36.320]   Well, the capacitors are coupling capacitors and basically the signal that comes out charges
[00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:39.280]   the capacitor and your headphones discharge the capacitor.
[00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:44.400]   And that's how the sound gets from the transistors inside to your ears.
[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:49.160]   And if you make those capacitors too small, they discharge too quickly on the bass notes.
[00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:53.080]   And that's just simple, you know, electronic physics.
[00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:54.120]   So it sounds like a...
[00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:55.120]   Instead of a...
[00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:56.120]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:57.120]   Was that again?
[00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:59.120]   Oh, instead of a...
[00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:01.720]   I think that's going down in history, Leo.
[00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:03.840]   That's going on Wikipedia next.
[00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:04.840]   Oh, shit.
[00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:07.800]   Hey, I think I forgot to introduce you, Bill McCrone.
[00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:08.800]   I can't believe it.
[00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:11.000]   We got sidetracked with Will Harris.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   That's Bill McCrone.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.520]   Actually, I did say something.
[00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:18.200]   You've been on it before, but who are you?
[00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:19.400]   Who are you Bill McCrone?
[00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:22.160]   He just got calls, calls in once in a while.
[00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:27.560]   Bill was the guy who started the original Ziff Davis television back in '94 and hired
[00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:28.560]   me.
[00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:33.360]   In fact, if it weren't for John C. Devorak at Bill McCrone, I don't know what I'd be doing.
[00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:34.360]   I'd be a DJ.
[00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:35.520]   Probably what you're doing now.
[00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:36.520]   Denver.
[00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:37.520]   I don't know.
[00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:41.040]   You guys gave me a big head start in life.
[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:42.040]   Thank you.
[00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:43.840]   Well, you say we gave you a big head?
[00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:44.840]   A big head, yeah.
[00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:46.840]   No, I was born with that, baby.
[00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:50.920]   So Bill, and then Bill for many years, the editor-in-chief of a PC magazine.
[00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:52.920]   And what are you doing these days?
[00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:55.160]   I'm freelancing.
[00:19:55.160 --> 00:20:02.960]   I'm doing all kinds of white papers and technical dissertations for a large variety of high-tech
[00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:07.080]   companies, and I'm still writing my column for PC Magazine.
[00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:15.280]   And I also have a subspecialty, a fun side business, which is modifying Fender amplifiers.
[00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:17.080]   To do what?
[00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:18.080]   Sound better.
[00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:19.080]   Oh, wow.
[00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:27.800]   So I take the raw material, Fender Blues Jr. and do a bunch of mods that I've designed
[00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:29.760]   over the years.
[00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:31.960]   You've always been a polymath, a renaissance guy.
[00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:34.120]   I mean, you've always had a broad range.
[00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:35.120]   I still have my--
[00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:36.600]   We always call them a crackpot.
[00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:39.440]   That works for me.
[00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:44.840]   I still have my ZD editorial award that you designed.
[00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:45.840]   Oh, yeah.
[00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:46.840]   I love that.
[00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:47.840]   Is it titanium?
[00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:48.840]   What is it?
[00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:49.840]   Some cool metal.
[00:20:49.840 --> 00:21:00.040]   It is titanium, and it had to be cut by a water jet that operates at 40 or 50,000 pounds
[00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:05.640]   per square inch, and when the water hits the titanium at that pressure and speed, it actually
[00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:06.640]   sparks.
[00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:07.640]   Oh, wow.
[00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:08.640]   It's a work of art.
[00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:09.800]   It's a beautiful thing.
[00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:14.840]   It's the Chairman's Circle Award from 1997 back when there was a chairman.
[00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:20.080]   It's good to have an award that can withstand re-entry to the earth at it.
[00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:22.360]   This thing is a lethal weapon.
[00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:24.360]   Are you kidding?
[00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:28.000]   Although that seemed to be the trend, because Miami Award has points so sharp you could poke
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.040]   a hole in somebody.
[00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:31.040]   I was wondering when you were going to plug your end.
[00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:32.280]   I haven't said anything.
[00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:33.520]   I can't find anything.
[00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:34.520]   I can't find it.
[00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:36.920]   I was-- I had a countdown thing here.
[00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:37.920]   I was doing a check.
[00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:39.720]   I know he was going to plug you watch.
[00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:40.720]   And boom.
[00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:41.720]   No.
[00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:42.720]   I haven't said it.
[00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:43.720]   This is the first time.
[00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:45.720]   Go check Wikipedia in 77 episodes I've mentioned.
[00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:48.000]   It'll be on there to not tomorrow.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.080]   This is going to be a new Wikipedia entry.
[00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:51.080]   How many minutes until--
[00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:52.080]   It's like the whole show.
[00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:54.080]   There's just a bunch of people plugging.
[00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:55.840]   We've got a new drinking game.
[00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:56.840]   No.
[00:21:56.840 --> 00:21:57.840]   Actually, the reason I mentioned it's a loss.
[00:21:57.840 --> 00:21:58.840]   I don't know where it is.
[00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:00.040]   It's in my garage somewhere.
[00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:01.040]   You lost your Emmy?
[00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:02.040]   I lost Miami.
[00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:03.040]   Oh, that's embarrassing.
[00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:08.240]   Next thing you know, we'll see it on eBay.
[00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:09.640]   Leo's Emmy.
[00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:15.600]   So Bill Gates talking at the Stanford University just a few days ago, right after the launch
[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:23.600]   of the Zoom, calls the iPod, the iPod, quote, "phenomenal, unbelievable, fantastic."
[00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:27.840]   And then says, "The Zoom is more modest.
[00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:31.000]   His goals are more modest than total domination of the port."
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.600]   That's good because, guess what?
[00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:33.600]   He got his wish.
[00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:36.080]   He got his wish for sure.
[00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:40.720]   He says, "The company wants to quote excite people about the concept of sharing music
[00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:41.920]   and video wirelessly."
[00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:42.920]   Yeah.
[00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:43.920]   But he doesn't--
[00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:45.520]   So he can play it all of three times.
[00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:49.000]   Do you think that Bill kind of was reading the writing on the wall, realized that Zoom
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   was going to be a flop and it started spinning already?
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:57.120]   Or does he legitimately think it's just modest?
[00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:58.120]   I think he's lost it.
[00:22:58.120 --> 00:22:59.120]   I think he's lost it.
[00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:02.520]   Bill Gates would never want to do anything less than spectacular with him.
[00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:06.960]   Well, the original, you know, hype out of Redmond was the Zoom was going to kill the
[00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:07.960]   iPod.
[00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:08.960]   This is the greatest thing ever.
[00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:13.960]   And I think as the reviews have started to come in, it's become clear that maybe Michael
[00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:17.280]   Rogers of mp3.com is right.
[00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:20.280]   He said it was going to be the flop of 2007.
[00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:23.600]   He said he'd be surprised if they sold more than 50,000 units.
[00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:24.600]   He was right.
[00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:25.600]   He was talking about the DRM.
[00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:29.120]   And that's what's wrong with the Zoom, not the form factor.
[00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:30.680]   Somebody's going to hack it.
[00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:31.680]   Oh, sure.
[00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:33.760]   I think that the Zoom gets hacked.
[00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:35.680]   It may actually be an easy hack.
[00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:39.200]   Sometimes these people put stuff in play and then they're all flabbergasted when it
[00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:41.960]   gets hacked, even though it was maybe designed to be hacked.
[00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:42.960]   You know what I mean?
[00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:44.320]   It's like, "Well, we did our part.
[00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:45.320]   We put this in.
[00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:46.320]   We put this in.
[00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:47.320]   We put these punk kids.
[00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:49.480]   They're always ruining it for everybody."
[00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:52.280]   It's like DVD decryptor.
[00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:58.200]   I mean, everybody knows where to get it and download it and everybody who needs to excerpt
[00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:06.400]   something under quote unquote "fair use" from a DVD uses it and edits stuff with it.
[00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:10.000]   Yeah, but that was not a secret plan of the movie industry.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.920]   I could tell you that right now.
[00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:13.640]   Oh, no.
[00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:15.040]   No, but...
[00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:16.040]   But everybody knows it.
[00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:22.000]   I think we probably should have a pool how long before somebody puts Linux on the Zoom.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.200]   What would you want to put Linux on this?
[00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:24.560]   You'll cut your crack it.
[00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:25.560]   I don't think it was wrong.
[00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:26.560]   Because you can.
[00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:27.560]   They put Linux on everything.
[00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:28.560]   You can put Linux on PSP.
[00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:29.560]   Yeah, you can.
[00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:32.960]   The PSP, you know, that's the thing that saved the PlayStation Portable was that was
[00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:33.960]   so hacked.
[00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:36.000]   Saved it is still doing well at all.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.960]   Well, let's save it exactly.
[00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:38.960]   So what are your bets?
[00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:39.960]   I mean, let's compare it.
[00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:40.960]   Look it.
[00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:42.600]   We've got some new products just came out.
[00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:43.600]   We've got the Zoom.
[00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:44.960]   We've got the PlayStation 3.
[00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:46.960]   We've got the Nintendo Wii comes out today.
[00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:47.960]   Right.
[00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:48.960]   I have the Nintendo Wii.
[00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:50.960]   Of the 3.
[00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:51.960]   What's the winner?
[00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:53.520]   Everybody says the Wii.
[00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:54.520]   Wii's the winner.
[00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:55.520]   PS3.
[00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:56.520]   PS3.
[00:24:56.520 --> 00:25:00.840]   Ah, a little contrarian view from Bill McCrone.
[00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:01.840]   Why you think?
[00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:03.840]   I mean, did you get a PS3, Bill?
[00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:05.240]   No, not yet.
[00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:09.360]   But because John said we have got a safe.
[00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:11.480]   The sell chip was very promising.
[00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:15.640]   But I'll tell you, I've talked to a number of people who got in line, waited two nights,
[00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:18.000]   slept overnight in the parking lot, got PS3.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:23.720]   I talked to one guy on the radio show yesterday who said he played with it for a few hours
[00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:27.560]   and he's ready to sell it now because it's terrible.
[00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:31.960]   He said, first of all, first thing that happens, it's an hour of firmware updating before you
[00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:33.240]   can even use it.
[00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:36.680]   This is one of the things we have when at the San Francisco office, the Davis office here
[00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:39.400]   in San Francisco, we were playing with it the other day.
[00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:43.360]   And the first thing that the text says, the first thing that happens when you boot it
[00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:45.560]   up, it says you got to go on the internet to get updated.
[00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:47.040]   For an hour.
[00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:50.720]   And it's like, wait a minute, what if you bought this for your kids, you don't really
[00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:53.160]   have an internet connection or don't want one.
[00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:55.480]   You can't even use it the thing it won't play.
[00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:59.200]   There is, by the way, no PlayStation Live is there.
[00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:01.840]   This is not like Xbox Live.
[00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:06.760]   No, it is the update that you get when you first turn it on.
[00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:10.080]   Let's upgrade the firmware from, I think, from 1.0 to 1.1.
[00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:16.080]   And 1.1 adds this kind of PlayStation network functionality, which is the PlayStation version
[00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:17.080]   of Xbox Live.
[00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:18.080]   Ah, OK.
[00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:20.920]   So why wasn't in the shipping PlayStation 3?
[00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:21.920]   No one will know.
[00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:24.720]   They just needed to respect the retail deadlines.
[00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:25.720]   I guess so.
[00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:28.040]   No rumble in the controllers.
[00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:31.040]   They didn't want to pay immersion for the license.
[00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:34.080]   Well, even the Wii has rumble.
[00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:35.760]   There's a great quote from somebody that said the PlayStation.
[00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:36.760]   The PlayStation is cool.
[00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:39.520]   The kids love the rumble.
[00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:40.520]   I like the rumble.
[00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:41.520]   I'm a rumble.
[00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:45.040]   I don't care one way or the other, Bill, but the fact is the kids love the rumble.
[00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:49.280]   You know what works in the Wii because it gives you, especially with the Wii Mo, where
[00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:53.760]   you're up in the air, it gives you some tactile feedback about what's going on on the screen.
[00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:56.920]   Yeah, that's fun, I guess, for I had it.
[00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:58.800]   Oh, man, you sound like an old fart.
[00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:02.080]   I am an old fart.
[00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:09.080]   You know, I've had my share of tactile controllers and things with all the G-forces and gyro
[00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:13.880]   things built into them, and they don't help you play the game any better.
[00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:17.520]   And geez, rumble, what are you going to, you know, after you get tired of it, what are
[00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:18.960]   you going to do to sit on it?
[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:23.280]   I think graphics would be the, you know, the high def would be the thing that the PlayStation
[00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:24.480]   3 would be promoting.
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:27.280]   You know, well, we support 720p, 1080i.
[00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:30.200]   We've got a Blu-ray HD DVD built in.
[00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:31.280]   Hey, I have to say.
[00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:32.280]   It looks good.
[00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:33.280]   Yes.
[00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:34.760]   Which game is where you're playing?
[00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:36.680]   The basketball game.
[00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:39.720]   You know, I've talked to other people who say, yeah, it's good, but it's not much better
[00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:42.280]   than the Xbox 360, which has been out for a year.
[00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:43.280]   No, it's true.
[00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:44.280]   It's not much better.
[00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:45.800]   Well, how could it be?
[00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:55.040]   I mean, the Xbox is HD as well, and it's, you know, it really put the, you know, it
[00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:58.640]   really set the bar that the PS3 has to leap over.
[00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:03.480]   All right, well, this week with, with Gears of War that came out on the 360 this week.
[00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:04.480]   Have you played Gears of War yet?
[00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:06.200]   This is everybody's talking about Gears of War.
[00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:07.200]   Have you played?
[00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:08.200]   Yeah, I just got it.
[00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:09.200]   And it really does look pretty unbelievable.
[00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:10.440]   I can't wait to play it.
[00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:11.760]   I'm excited.
[00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:13.720]   So of the three, we're not talking about the Xbox.
[00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:18.160]   I think the Xbox is the one to get, but of the three, the Zoom, the PlayStation 3 and
[00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:19.720]   the Wii, what do you think is the winner?
[00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:21.880]   What are the losers this week?
[00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:26.640]   Well, well, I think everybody, everybody is mental about the Wii.
[00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:31.120]   Everybody is as hyped it up now to the point where it almost can't possibly deliver what
[00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:32.120]   everybody thinks it can.
[00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:34.080]   Hey, but it's only 250 bucks.
[00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:35.080]   Well, that's true.
[00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:36.560]   It doesn't have to deliver as much.
[00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:37.560]   Right.
[00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:40.480]   It's funny because that seemed like a lot for a console a few years ago, but now that
[00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:41.480]   seems like nothing.
[00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:45.480]   Well, there was a great strip on them on Penny Arcade if you read that.
[00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:46.480]   I love Penny Arcade.
[00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:51.160]   Where they had, they were taking the, the mic out of the fact that the Wii controller
[00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:53.760]   is designed, you're sort of designed, you know, you're playing golf, you stand up and
[00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:58.920]   you swing it like a golf club or you're playing tennis and you run around like a tennis racket.
[00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:02.320]   And they were saying that you actually can just sit on the couch and just like flick
[00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:03.520]   your wrist a little bit.
[00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:05.480]   Yeah, but that's like that has exactly the same effect.
[00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:08.760]   And that was the point was that one of them was standing up and flinging around the other
[00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:12.280]   guy who was sitting on the couch and then the guy was like, yeah, but you just looked
[00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:13.280]   like a tool.
[00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:17.920]   Like the guy going.
[00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:23.240]   Speaking of a DVD copying, this, this just fries my gizzard.
[00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:26.160]   The motion picture association of America is at it again.
[00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:32.520]   There's a DVD ripping service in Boston called load and go a couple of years old.
[00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:33.520]   It's actually a great idea.
[00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:37.960]   They sell DVDs, DVD movies, they sell iPods and they sell a service.
[00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:43.200]   If you buy a DVD and an iPod, they'll put the contents of the DVD on the iPod and then
[00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:44.200]   send you all three.
[00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:49.240]   So you've got the iPod with the videos and the DVD that you legally bought.
[00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:53.240]   Now of course, technically that's illegal of violation of the DMCA because it's a copy
[00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:54.240]   protected disc.
[00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:56.480]   The MPAA is suing.
[00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:58.120]   They're saying that's illegal.
[00:29:58.120 --> 00:30:00.560]   We want to put you out of business.
[00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:05.320]   Now the thing that gripes me about this is now they now it's very clear what their motivation
[00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:06.320]   is.
[00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:07.320]   It's not about piracy.
[00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:08.320]   These guys aren't pirating.
[00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:10.160]   You buy the DVD.
[00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:11.920]   What it's about is greed.
[00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:15.240]   They want an additional 10 bucks so you could put it on your iPod.
[00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:17.920]   They don't want you putting it on your iPod.
[00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:20.200]   They sell a fresh copy in every single format.
[00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:21.200]   Every format.
[00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:22.200]   That's pure greed.
[00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:23.840]   I played 10 bucks to see the movie in the theater.
[00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:28.640]   I paid 20 bucks for the DVD and now they want 10 bucks or 15 bucks for the movie.
[00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:31.080]   Well by your logic Leo, that means you can go to the theater.
[00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:34.000]   Once you see it on the theater, you should have all these different copies.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.280]   I'm not going to take their side on this because I think the real problem here is the
[00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:41.440]   fact that they're overcharging for the secondary services.
[00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:46.720]   And I think, but if they don't want, if it says it's pretty clear, I think it's they
[00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:47.720]   are.
[00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:49.720]   I think technically I would take their side.
[00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:50.720]   What's legal?
[00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:53.040]   I mean, nobody's denying that the DMCA is very clear.
[00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:55.320]   You're not allowed to do this.
[00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:59.200]   Seems to me if I buy a DVD, I should be able to put it on whatever the hell I want to put
[00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:00.200]   it on.
[00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:01.440]   Well, then I get taken back to the other argument.
[00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:04.800]   If you went to see it in the theater, does that mean you have a right to have free copy?
[00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:05.800]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:06.800]   Where you draw the line?
[00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:12.000]   No, I think that's different though because I mean a movie is a sort of public showing.
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.400]   A DVD is a personal copy.
[00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:15.400]   I got it.
[00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:16.400]   I bought it.
[00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:17.400]   I wish you would.
[00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:18.400]   I wish you would.
[00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:19.400]   Right.
[00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:21.800]   I mean, that's a little more paid in the movie theater and for the DVD.
[00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:27.560]   But I do absolutely resent the fact that they seem to think it's somehow illegal for me.
[00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:31.320]   It's same thing goes with a CD and you know, the RIA is going back and forth about whether
[00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:35.360]   there's such a thing as a fair use of a CD, but it seems like ultimately if there were
[00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:37.600]   such a service with a CD, they'd go after them.
[00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:40.640]   They don't want you to rip CDs.
[00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:42.280]   Do you think that's a problem, John?
[00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:45.080]   I could buy a CD to put on my iPod and that's illegal.
[00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:50.360]   Well, I see that goes back to the record rental days when people used to, you know, with
[00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:54.920]   vinyl, there was a bunch of stores that cropped up in Berkeley and they started renting vinyl.
[00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:55.920]   What would people do?
[00:31:55.920 --> 00:32:00.600]   Of course, you take a home and you'd record it on a reel to reel or whatever mechanism
[00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:02.360]   you had and then you'd have the thing.
[00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:05.160]   I mean, that's what people were doing, but that wasn't designed for that.
[00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:06.160]   It was designed where there was something--
[00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:07.160]   But we're not talking about rental.
[00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:08.160]   They're buying.
[00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:09.160]   This is purchasing.
[00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:10.160]   I understand.
[00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:11.160]   I understand these laws go back.
[00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:15.840]   I don't know how wrong it is, but these laws go kind of back to that, you know, what was
[00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:16.840]   going on there.
[00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:21.560]   And I think now they're thinking, "Well," and then I think the software business has
[00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:22.560]   affected this.
[00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:26.280]   The software guys are the ones who came up with the idea that you're buying a license
[00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:27.640]   instead of you're not really buying the car.
[00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:29.440]   You don't even own the software.
[00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:30.440]   You're just licensing it.
[00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:35.160]   That means you're subject to all these rules and regulations that come with the license.
[00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:36.400]   No home user wants this.
[00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:38.080]   I mean, this is not what people want.
[00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:40.080]   I guess the question is, can they put it over on us?
[00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:43.080]   Are we in our cattle sufficiently cotowed?
[00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:45.240]   I think it's great.
[00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:46.240]   You know why?
[00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:47.240]   Why?
[00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:49.120]   Because it makes people more technically adept.
[00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:51.120]   Stealing stuff.
[00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:52.120]   Absolutely.
[00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:58.560]   And this is the 55 mile an hour speed limit all over again.
[00:32:58.560 --> 00:32:59.560]   Prohibition.
[00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:03.120]   Car and driver's excellent vote with your foot.
[00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:07.360]   Well, there's also the radar detectors is probably where you're headed with that kind
[00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:08.360]   of thing.
[00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:10.120]   So a lot of people are to make bathtub gin.
[00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:13.920]   My favorite radar detectors are ones that send a signal back saying you're only doing
[00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:14.920]   35.
[00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:15.920]   Absolutely.
[00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:16.920]   Oh, that's brilliant.
[00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:17.920]   Yes.
[00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:18.920]   You could buy that.
[00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:19.920]   That's probably legal in every state, right?
[00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:21.760]   Those are totally illegal, but they work great.
[00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:23.400]   They do.
[00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:24.880]   So you go boom.
[00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:28.480]   And the cop goes, wow, that doesn't look like 35, but that's what the gun said.
[00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:30.520]   They haven't worked in the defense industry.
[00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:35.520]   I can once upon a time, I can tell you that these things do work.
[00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:36.520]   Wow.
[00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:42.080]   Well, I want your technical expertise here, Bill McCrum, because I am baffled about the
[00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:43.080]   optimus keyboard.
[00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:45.680]   Have you been following the art, Lebadev?
[00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:48.680]   Yeah, that's the OLED keyboard.
[00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:49.680]   Yeah.
[00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:52.600]   And I'll be honest with you, I mean, it's been a year and a half that they've been hyping
[00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:53.600]   this.
[00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:58.040]   A keyboard that has OLED keys that are programmable.
[00:33:58.040 --> 00:33:59.040]   Right.
[00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:00.040]   Right.
[00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:02.560]   And now they're going to take pre-orders in a month.
[00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:06.040]   Is it real or is it a scam?
[00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:08.720]   I think it's a performance art piece.
[00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:10.480]   I can tell you that.
[00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:12.120]   I don't need one.
[00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:13.120]   Does anybody?
[00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:14.120]   No, you know what?
[00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:19.040]   I know, I was skeptical about this thing, but there's issues with OLEDs.
[00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:23.040]   I mean, that people just don't want to talk about, which is that they fade.
[00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:24.040]   And they're never a state board.
[00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:26.960]   Well, would they take the abuse of a keyboard or pounding on them?
[00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:27.960]   I mean, would that be?
[00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:29.440]   I don't think it's an abuse issue.
[00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:30.760]   I think it's just a team.
[00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:31.760]   These things are not that.
[00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:35.880]   I mean, if the OLEDs worked as well as everybody wants, I mean, they work on phones, but they
[00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:37.600]   are only good for about a year or so.
[00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:38.600]   That's interesting.
[00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:42.800]   I mean, it's just not a, it's not a completely, it's a chemical situation we're dealing
[00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:43.800]   with here.
[00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:45.400]   I mean, the idea of this keyboard is very cool.
[00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:48.400]   So it's a courty keyboard until you start running Photoshop.
[00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:52.960]   And then all of a sudden, magically, the cue turns into a Photoshop icon, the W into
[00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:53.960]   a photo.
[00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:55.880]   So you actually have these Photoshop tools.
[00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:56.880]   Yeah.
[00:34:56.880 --> 00:34:59.880]   And then you start playing Quake and it turns into icons.
[00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:00.880]   Yeah.
[00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:02.280]   Does this remind you a bill, remember this?
[00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:03.280]   There's all these guys.
[00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:08.560]   This has been attempted in various forms for 20 years, which is these little templates
[00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:11.760]   that you dropped on top of the keyboard that would do all this stuff or all that.
[00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:12.760]   Nobody cares.
[00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:17.560]   Most people who are professionals using Photoshop, they know all these failures know the way.
[00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:18.560]   Yeah.
[00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:19.560]   You learn the finger of Macros.
[00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:23.160]   But let me ask you, Bill, is it technically doable, do you think?
[00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:24.160]   Yes.
[00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:29.000]   There's no reason why you can't do it, but I agree with John that OLED could be a little
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:30.760]   bit scary.
[00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:33.360]   It's still a fairly young technology.
[00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:41.800]   Although I do know of one forthcoming major manufacturer laptop that has a supplemental
[00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:47.480]   display on it that has a OLED, it's an OLED display.
[00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:50.520]   That's the concept here, I guess, is it?
[00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:51.920]   You don't have to have just be a keyboard.
[00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:53.640]   It could be just a little keypad.
[00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:55.480]   Well, this is just a status display.
[00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:58.400]   It doesn't, it can't push it to do anything.
[00:35:58.400 --> 00:35:59.400]   Okay.
[00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:01.400]   Did you make touch OLEDs?
[00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:03.440]   I guess it's not touch, it's just a switch, right?
[00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:10.120]   Yeah, this is just, it's actually built into the key itself.
[00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:19.040]   So it's an interesting idea and maybe good for when you're learning Photoshop or whatever,
[00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:22.320]   but just another thing to look down at.
[00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:24.960]   You know, I want to just mention this to the listeners out there.
[00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:30.920]   If anybody wants to really do some interesting understanding of how radio works, try to figure
[00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:40.160]   the segue here where Leo changed the subject from MPAA in his onerous attempts to stiff the
[00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:44.280]   public to this topic because I'm still kind of scratching my head over it.
[00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:45.440]   But it was smooth, wasn't it?
[00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:46.440]   It was great.
[00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:47.440]   It was outstanding.
[00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:50.000]   In fact, if you hadn't felt attention to it, I don't think anybody would have noticed.
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:53.120]   Well, yeah, no, I think that, fortunately, here's what happened.
[00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:56.920]   I drew my attention to it was that I don't think we ever resolved the other issue.
[00:36:56.920 --> 00:37:00.240]   And I know that listeners out there, you know, when they get into a topic.
[00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:01.240]   What's the resolution?
[00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:02.240]   I don't know.
[00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:04.240]   I think that's probably why you're.
[00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:05.240]   There is a resolution.
[00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:06.240]   There is a resolution.
[00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:10.360]   You're pointing out that the MPAA is suing over something stupid.
[00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:11.360]   You think it's not stupid.
[00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:13.120]   You think that we ought to pay for every version?
[00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:14.120]   No, I didn't.
[00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:15.120]   I didn't say that.
[00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:16.120]   Okay.
[00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:18.000]   So there's two, the resolution here is this.
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.680]   There is, you know, there are two US laws.
[00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:23.840]   One is the DMCA, which says you can't make copies of stuff if it's copy protected.
[00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:28.840]   The other is the variously enshrined versions of fair use law, which say that you can copy
[00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:33.000]   the fiscal, your personal use and you're not making profit off it, et cetera.
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.560]   And these two laws appear to sit in complete opposite.
[00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:37.200]   This is been the issue long, yes.
[00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:39.960]   And that there is no resolution to that in US.
[00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:41.200]   Until there is a court case.
[00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:44.160]   So somebody goes to court and tries to resolve it.
[00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:48.000]   Then, until that happens and this, maybe this will go to court and maybe this will resolve
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   it.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.880]   It is not the side of the situation.
[00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:51.880]   Hey, hey, hey, hey.
[00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:52.880]   He went to law school, John.
[00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:54.880]   I didn't say that.
[00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:56.520]   He's got a wig and everything.
[00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:59.520]   Would you have been a barrister or a solicitor?
[00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:02.760]   What the hell's the difference?
[00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:03.760]   Yeah, really.
[00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:05.920]   Well, in England, you have two.
[00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:07.360]   I don't really want to know.
[00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:08.360]   I'm sorry.
[00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:11.520]   Yeah, we got to look it up on Wikipedia, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:15.960]   But seriously, is it which one would you have been or would you be a just plain old lawyer?
[00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:17.640]   No, I would be a solicitor.
[00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:19.640]   I like it.
[00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:22.360]   Commercial law and I see all that stuff is good.
[00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:25.280]   It's kept some pretty hot looking solicitors down in Soho.
[00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:29.120]   That's not the same kind of solicitation, John.
[00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:34.960]   So we were talking about games and you were talking about how Good Gears of War is.
[00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:35.960]   Yes, indeed.
[00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:42.640]   You know, this to me, the reason to buy an Xbox 360 is Gears of War today, Halo 3 tomorrow.
[00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:43.640]   Absolutely.
[00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:44.640]   I am so excited.
[00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:50.640]   I just announced that there will be a Halo 3 beta forthcoming.
[00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:51.640]   Which is quite exciting.
[00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:52.640]   Which is quite exciting.
[00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:55.640]   I guess we have to wait till spring, it looks like, right?
[00:38:55.640 --> 00:39:01.640]   By the way, when he said beta, just for translation, what is that?
[00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:02.640]   It's beta.
[00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:03.640]   Okay.
[00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:07.000]   When I go to England and give talks, I always have to say beta or you don't know what I'm
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   talking about.
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:11.760]   I have a car that's a beta, but I don't think that's the same thing.
[00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:13.280]   I think it's a beta up.
[00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:19.760]   So anyway, does anyone know how we're going to be able to upgrade those Xbox 360s to the
[00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:20.760]   HD DVD?
[00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:21.760]   Yeah.
[00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:22.760]   Plug it in.
[00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:24.000]   In January, 200 bucks.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.200]   Is it going to be internal?
[00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:31.480]   No, it's like a bag that hangs off the side.
[00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:33.280]   It's horrible.
[00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:36.680]   You just plug it in over USB.
[00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:38.680]   It's literally just a 5-plus.
[00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:39.680]   But it clips on, doesn't it?
[00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:40.960]   It kind of clips on, doesn't it?
[00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:41.960]   Or no?
[00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:42.960]   No.
[00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:44.960]   It's just a little bit of a sand loan unit.
[00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:48.480]   It's basically like, if you think on your PC, you've just got an external, say-
[00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:49.480]   Yeah.
[00:39:49.480 --> 00:40:12.800]   --
[00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:14.680]   There you go.
[00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:20.080]   But see, that's really interesting because if you're looking at the first HD DVD players,
[00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:23.880]   it was a whole computer with Linux and it had to boot.
[00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:24.880]   What happened?
[00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:26.840]   I mean, those two-
[00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:27.840]   Well, they were just-
[00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:28.840]   Well, they understand the language.
[00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:29.840]   Yeah.
[00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:34.080]   They were slow and they were big and they were $800 a thousand bucks.
[00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:36.600]   This is 200 bucks and it's just a bare bones drive.
[00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:40.560]   Yeah, and all it does, I mean, it just hooks up and uses all the processing power from
[00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:41.560]   the 360.
[00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:42.560]   There's a lot of-
[00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:44.560]   So all those processes in the 360-
[00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:48.600]   That's got three power PC chips in it, right?
[00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:51.760]   And the ATI graphics chip as well.
[00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:52.760]   I see.
[00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:54.080]   I'm thinking, why buy a PlayStation 3?
[00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:55.080]   Get an Xbox 360.
[00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:56.720]   You can walk in the door.
[00:40:56.720 --> 00:40:58.640]   They've got a whole rack of them.
[00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:02.840]   They've already had the six months of not working and that's out of the way.
[00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:06.240]   We're hearing, by the way, that people are already having trouble with their PlayStation
[00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:07.240]   3.
[00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:09.200]   Blue screen of death after 30 minutes of play.
[00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:11.080]   That's already happening.
[00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:13.280]   You don't want to be the first to buy one of these.
[00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:18.200]   Now version one software is version one software, no matter who cranks it out.
[00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:20.840]   I think the consoles seem actually worse.
[00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:23.480]   At least in the last few years, their record has been worse in terms of-
[00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:25.960]   Oh, definitely, as they've got more like PCs.
[00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:30.280]   Well, I think it's because Microsoft, I credit Microsoft with this.
[00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:36.480]   Microsoft came into the game with the normal upgrade cycles in mind, which is every 18
[00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:37.480]   months or so.
[00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:41.240]   It's just a little bit worse to crank it up a little bit, whereas Sony and even Nintendo
[00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:47.960]   to a lesser degree were used to these long upgrade cycles for their consoles.
[00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:49.880]   I think they were pushed a little bit.
[00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:54.160]   In the case of Sony, I don't think this thing should have been two years from now, but they
[00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:55.160]   have to decide.
[00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:56.160]   Sorry, a year later.
[00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:57.160]   What are you going to do?
[00:41:57.160 --> 00:42:00.240]   Well, that just proves that they can't handle this type of turnaround.
[00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:01.680]   Same thing with the Zoom.
[00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:07.240]   It's pretty clear the Zoom is beta.
[00:42:07.240 --> 00:42:08.240]   I can't.
[00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:09.840]   I'm sorry, it's hard to say that was the same.
[00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:10.840]   It's kind of beta color.
[00:42:10.840 --> 00:42:11.840]   It's beta.
[00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:16.280]   It's beta brown because they're all a functionality.
[00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:19.040]   They keep saying, "Oh, well, the Wi-Fi will do more later."
[00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:22.360]   Oh, the copy protection will work differently later.
[00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:25.000]   It sounds like they're planning on massive firmware upgrades for this thing.
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:28.200]   Well, it seems like it's the same strategy that Sony has taken with, for example, the
[00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:32.400]   PlayStation Portable, which has had a firmware update, perhaps clear every month for the
[00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:33.400]   last two years.
[00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:34.400]   It's been out for that.
[00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:37.200]   Well, that's to fight pirates because every time somebody figures out a hack, they're
[00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:38.200]   not.
[00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:45.360]   Which is incomprehensible since the only reason anybody still buys a PSP is to hack it.
[00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:46.360]   What is Sony doing?
[00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:50.480]   They're really providing a development platform and they don't know.
[00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:52.560]   They're in the wrong business once again.
[00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:54.520]   They really are.
[00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:55.520]   It's crazy.
[00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:57.920]   I mean, seriously, that's the reason people buy PSPs now.
[00:42:57.920 --> 00:43:01.880]   Yeah, just to hack and load Linux on and have fun with.
[00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:07.600]   And so we had somebody on the show this week on the TV show this week who showed us, it's
[00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:13.560]   from PSPhacks.com, I think, they showed us how you can trick the PSP into thinking it
[00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:15.040]   has firmware at one point.
[00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:20.080]   No, I guess you put the newest firmware, 2.7 on, but it only looks that way.
[00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:22.280]   It really has 1.5, so you could still hack it.
[00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:26.240]   But the games that are looking for 2.7, because that's how they're getting people to do this,
[00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:28.600]   games won't work on the hackable ROMs.
[00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:31.840]   You have to upgrade the firmware just to play the latest games.
[00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:35.240]   So it's a hack that makes it look like it's got the newest ROMs.
[00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:38.080]   Well, this is the whole thing with virtualization.
[00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:39.080]   Yeah.
[00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:46.160]   Did any of you happen to catch Joanna Raskowski's hack of the new operating systems?
[00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:47.160]   Blue pill and the--
[00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:48.160]   Yeah, Blue pill.
[00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:49.160]   Yeah.
[00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:50.160]   Did you guys discuss that already?
[00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:51.160]   We talked-- not on this show.
[00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:52.160]   We talked a little bit about it on security now.
[00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:54.400]   It's a little terrifying.
[00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:59.800]   It's-- well, what she said is basically virtualization is three years too early that
[00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:07.080]   somebody should have sat around and developed some security for it before the operating
[00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:10.320]   system companies and Intel and AMD introduced it.
[00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:11.920]   It's basically a root kit on steroids.
[00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:14.040]   It's completely undetectable.
[00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:16.040]   A hack.
[00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:17.040]   Yeah.
[00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:22.600]   Switching the entire operating system into a virtual machine in a millisecond, and then
[00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:24.520]   you have total control over it.
[00:44:24.520 --> 00:44:26.080]   Isn't that nice?
[00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:27.080]   I love it.
[00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:28.080]   And then they're the experts.
[00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:29.560]   It's funny, because the experts are saying, "Well, no, no.
[00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:34.360]   You could always tell if you're in hypervisor mode because certain instructions take longer."
[00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:39.760]   So then John says, "Well, true, but you could change the operating systems reporting on
[00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:40.960]   how long things are taking."
[00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:41.960]   Exactly.
[00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:44.320]   And then they go, "Well, you've got the world clock."
[00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:47.680]   Well, you can always ignore atomic clock and modify that.
[00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:52.000]   If you have ultimate control of the operating system, you can make it say anything you want.
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:53.000]   Absolutely.
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   That's fun.
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:59.360]   But the other cool thing that you mentioned before, the having the ATI chip and the
[00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:07.960]   chip in there, and one of the things I think is in the Xbox, and this whole GPU movement.
[00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:09.280]   This is really interesting.
[00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:10.280]   What's that?
[00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:12.280]   I don't know about that.
[00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:13.280]   Will?
[00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:14.280]   Give it a shot.
[00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:21.760]   Well, it's the idea of using a graphics card to do a task which you are not graphics rendering.
[00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:23.320]   Well, they're good processors.
[00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:24.320]   I mean, these are very high-end.
[00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:25.320]   Right.
[00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:31.000]   So, graphics card, let's say, got 44 pipelines which you would normally use for rendering
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   graphics.
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:35.840]   But if you think about it, they're just like, say, 44 or 48 parallel processors.
[00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:40.400]   So if you've got a data set that fits that kind of processing, then you can just absolutely
[00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:41.400]   churn through it.
[00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:43.160]   It rates that CPUs could only dream of.
[00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:44.160]   How are people using this?
[00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:48.400]   Well, for example, do you know the sort of folding at home project?
[00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:49.400]   Yeah.
[00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:50.400]   Yes.
[00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:51.400]   It's the idea of getting...
[00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:52.400]   The protein folding, yeah.
[00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:53.400]   It's a solid medical problem.
[00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:54.400]   So...
[00:45:54.400 --> 00:46:00.520]   So, the guys at Stanford just released a client for that that works on ATI GPUs.
[00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:01.520]   Oh, that's great.
[00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:02.520]   Oh, that's brilliant.
[00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:08.160]   And you can literally get a 15x performance over a dual core core two.
[00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:10.160]   It's really mind-boggling basically.
[00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:13.920]   We basically have super computers on our desks here.
[00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:15.720]   I mean, just over the top power.
[00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:16.720]   It's really good.
[00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:18.520]   Well, A and have a teraflop.
[00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:23.920]   If you want it, you can put enough ATI cards in it in a server.
[00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:24.920]   So what A and D...
[00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:26.920]   But these aren't as good as a general purpose processor.
[00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:27.920]   I mean...
[00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:34.480]   Well, what AMD is doing now owns ATI is it's selling these as a supplement to processors
[00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:35.680]   for industries that need them.
[00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:41.040]   So if you get a server, you can buy a server now racked with ATI graphics cards that are
[00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:45.480]   branded AMD stream processors.
[00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:46.480]   And so you've got your...
[00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:47.480]   Now the purchase makes sense.
[00:46:47.480 --> 00:46:52.920]   But you've got your CPUs for general processing for your specific tasks that need this kind
[00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:55.160]   of massively parallel data set stuff.
[00:46:55.160 --> 00:46:56.160]   Do you think that that...
[00:46:56.160 --> 00:46:58.040]   You can buy these stream GPUs to go in.
[00:46:58.040 --> 00:46:59.800]   Was that what AMD was thinking when it bought?
[00:46:59.800 --> 00:47:00.800]   And now they...
[00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:01.800]   Oh, exactly.
[00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:02.800]   That would make sense.
[00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:03.800]   Well, you know...
[00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:05.360]   I'll disagree a little bit about some of this.
[00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:14.600]   I mean, AMD really did buy ATI for the purposes of making a system that incorporated graphics
[00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:16.640]   because Intel did.
[00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:17.720]   I mean, and they're using it.
[00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:21.680]   I just saw the latest versions of their kind of combo.
[00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:25.120]   In fact, I wrote about this sort of writing.
[00:47:25.120 --> 00:47:27.680]   The next insight track talks about this a little bit.
[00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:32.320]   But because when they were showing, they were doing a dog and pony show recently and
[00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:36.440]   they were in the city with their quad, you know, two dual core systems that they're pushing
[00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:41.240]   now that are coming out like soon.
[00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:45.240]   And they were loaded up with Nvidia cards.
[00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:47.040]   So I mean, they weren't using the...
[00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:48.040]   They were even...
[00:47:48.040 --> 00:47:51.560]   They still think the 8800 is the super card for this kind of...
[00:47:51.560 --> 00:47:52.560]   Well, that's really...
[00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:57.040]   I mean, that's really funny because this whole the 4x4, the quad platform, was originally
[00:47:57.040 --> 00:48:02.000]   put in place with Nvidia stuff, I think before the ATI, the old went there and all the electronics
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:03.480]   for that to go in.
[00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:07.760]   I think we're all set up before any of this was destined to go through.
[00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:11.760]   And so now what's really funny on a personal level is that you've got loads of ATI employees
[00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:17.480]   now, or X ATI employees standing up promoting this 4x4 and saying that Nvidia is the best
[00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:19.240]   thing since sliced bread.
[00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:22.160]   And I think it's making for some interesting personal dynamics.
[00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:26.600]   You know, I try to get Kevin Creewell on the show from Nvidia because I wanted him to talk
[00:48:26.600 --> 00:48:28.280]   a little bit about this and he hasn't responded back.
[00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:30.240]   We will get him on down the road.
[00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:33.440]   Yeah, well, there's some politicking going on of some sort of sort.
[00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:34.440]   But there is...
[00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:38.720]   If you go to devorekincensored devorek.org/blog and type in GPU into the search, you'll see
[00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:39.720]   some...
[00:48:39.720 --> 00:48:41.280]   We've already covered some of the stories.
[00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:42.720]   I think it's back to the originals.
[00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:48.720]   You could either solve the world's AIDS crisis or you could run Vista Arrow.
[00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:49.720]   So you kind of have a choice.
[00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:50.720]   One of the two.
[00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:51.720]   Yeah.
[00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:52.720]   One of the two.
[00:48:52.720 --> 00:48:53.720]   You know, that's a real advantage of these GPUs.
[00:48:53.720 --> 00:48:54.720]   They're really multi-purpose devices.
[00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:59.640]   Well, I like it because I mean, WordStar boots so fast now.
[00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:01.880]   You know what doesn't run with Vista?
[00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:02.880]   Zoom.
[00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:03.880]   The Zoom.
[00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:04.880]   Yeah, well, no, that...
[00:49:04.880 --> 00:49:07.560]   I can mention that's going to be fixed with Word.
[00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:08.560]   That's another firmware.
[00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:09.560]   Okay, yeah, firmware 2.
[00:49:09.560 --> 00:49:10.560]   No, that's not a problem.
[00:49:10.560 --> 00:49:12.440]   We'll be updating that a little bit later.
[00:49:12.440 --> 00:49:13.840]   It's funny a little later.
[00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:18.440]   It's just been talking about snafus of the week.
[00:49:18.440 --> 00:49:25.200]   What about the sort of two high profile personnel departures on the interweb this week?
[00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:26.200]   Well now there are a number.
[00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:27.480]   Are you going to talk about ValleyWag?
[00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:28.480]   Is that one of them?
[00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:31.400]   Well, number one is ValleyWag and number two is Netscape, isn't it?
[00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:35.120]   All right, maybe we should start with the one that people actually care about.
[00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:36.680]   What's that?
[00:49:36.680 --> 00:49:41.680]   I would not leave that to you guys.
[00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:42.680]   Prickets.
[00:49:42.680 --> 00:49:45.400]   I'm not going to say.
[00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:47.720]   You know, the one everybody cares about.
[00:49:47.720 --> 00:49:49.680]   All right, let's talk about Netscape.
[00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:50.840]   I'll choose Netscape.
[00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:51.840]   Who left Netscape?
[00:49:51.840 --> 00:49:53.680]   You mean Jason Calicanos?
[00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:54.680]   I'm Ted Leon.
[00:49:54.680 --> 00:49:55.680]   And Leonsis too.
[00:49:55.680 --> 00:49:56.680]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:49:56.680 --> 00:49:57.680]   I didn't know.
[00:49:57.680 --> 00:49:58.680]   I didn't even know this.
[00:49:58.680 --> 00:49:59.680]   Well...
[00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:00.680]   I didn't know Leonsis quit.
[00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:01.680]   Well, he was pushed.
[00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:03.680]   Okay, I didn't know he was pushed.
[00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:05.920]   Hand off the bush under the bus.
[00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:08.320]   And they brought in an NBC executive to replace Jay.
[00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:09.320]   Oh, right, yeah.
[00:50:09.320 --> 00:50:10.320]   I remember that part of it.
[00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:12.560]   That's replacing Jason's mentor.
[00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:14.920]   I mean, this is guys who don't know what to do.
[00:50:14.920 --> 00:50:17.920]   They bring these guys in, these guys outside the industry.
[00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:19.240]   I mean, they should have given the whole business.
[00:50:19.240 --> 00:50:21.920]   I think Leonsis would have done a great job just managing the whole thing.
[00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:24.200]   I don't know why he didn't push him up.
[00:50:24.200 --> 00:50:25.840]   He's, you know, a pretty smart guy.
[00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:27.080]   He's been in the business for a long time.
[00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:30.000]   He knows what he's talking about.
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:35.800]   The Nick Denton thing with over at Valley WAG pushing out...
[00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:37.800]   Nick Douglas, which is very confusing.
[00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:38.800]   Yeah.
[00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:41.800]   He was now playing for Nick Douglas, Nick Denton.
[00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:43.120]   Douglas is a nice guy.
[00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:45.600]   I thought he was doing a good job as a good guy.
[00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:46.600]   He's a good guy.
[00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:50.600]   We're going to have Nickle join us on a net at night tonight to talk about what happened.
[00:50:50.600 --> 00:50:54.360]   I mean, that's the thing for this job that I wouldn't do in a million years.
[00:50:54.360 --> 00:50:56.160]   And he was doing it, I thought, a pretty thing up job.
[00:50:56.160 --> 00:50:58.400]   Well, on the other hand, I'm looking at the new Valley WAG.
[00:50:58.400 --> 00:51:00.000]   It's certainly content rich.
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:01.000]   Don't you?
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:03.600]   Well, they're going off the tech crunch they want, though.
[00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:06.200]   They said they're going to go less off the gossip and more off the deals.
[00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:07.600]   So it seemed like a great guy.
[00:51:07.600 --> 00:51:09.000]   I like the call of tech crunch.
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:12.280]   Yeah, the gossip is a lot of...
[00:51:12.280 --> 00:51:13.600]   I think gossip is risky.
[00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:14.600]   I think they're...
[00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:15.600]   They were worried about getting sued?
[00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:19.240]   I think there's some lawsuit action that takes place when you start doing that sort of thing.
[00:51:19.240 --> 00:51:20.240]   And I think that's what happened.
[00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:23.400]   I think that's why they had to, you know, throw them under the bus.
[00:51:23.400 --> 00:51:24.400]   Interesting.
[00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:25.760]   I mean, I'm just guessing.
[00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:27.600]   I have no idea when we get them on the show.
[00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:31.040]   And actually, he probably won't, because of non-disclosures and stuff, and maybe a year
[00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:32.200]   or two before he found out what we did.
[00:51:32.200 --> 00:51:33.200]   Yeah.
[00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:36.000]   He says he won't talk about it, but Amber's co-host of the show, and I think she can get
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:37.000]   him to say anything.
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:39.600]   No, just never bad her eyes.
[00:51:39.600 --> 00:51:42.960]   Well, it is audio, but I'm sure she can...
[00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:47.080]   I have to say, I've been reading the new Valley WAG, and it's just very different.
[00:51:47.080 --> 00:51:48.160]   I like it.
[00:51:48.160 --> 00:51:50.400]   It's like 800 posts a day.
[00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:53.440]   It's just a different thing.
[00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:57.160]   There is a kind of confluence between the Callicannus leaving and the Douglas leaving.
[00:51:57.160 --> 00:51:58.160]   Yeah.
[00:51:58.160 --> 00:51:59.160]   I mean, they kind of go together.
[00:51:59.160 --> 00:52:00.160]   It's somehow...
[00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:02.080]   The Callicannus leaving is full of gossip.
[00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:04.280]   I mean, it's just one of those...
[00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:07.880]   Jason is a master getting pressed for absolutely nothing.
[00:52:07.880 --> 00:52:10.680]   Well, there's not that much gossip, is there?
[00:52:10.680 --> 00:52:12.640]   I mean, it's mostly Lianca's leaves.
[00:52:12.640 --> 00:52:13.640]   He was Jason's mentor.
[00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:14.880]   Was it Lianca's mentor?
[00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:17.920]   No, Jason's mentor was this other guy.
[00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:20.200]   What's his name?
[00:52:20.200 --> 00:52:22.760]   John Miller.
[00:52:22.760 --> 00:52:25.760]   So Miller was the CEO at AOL.
[00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:26.760]   Okay.
[00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:31.000]   And brought in Callicannus.
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:34.960]   Miller gets replaced by this NBC executive.
[00:52:34.960 --> 00:52:38.240]   And within a few days, Callicannus is gone.
[00:52:38.240 --> 00:52:39.800]   No one knows how or why.
[00:52:39.800 --> 00:52:43.120]   In fact, I don't even know if it's confirmed that he's gone.
[00:52:43.120 --> 00:52:44.120]   He hasn't said that he's...
[00:52:44.120 --> 00:52:45.120]   Oh, yes.
[00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:46.120]   No, John Miller.
[00:52:46.120 --> 00:52:47.120]   Sorry, yes.
[00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:48.120]   Yeah, not Lianca's.
[00:52:48.120 --> 00:52:50.160]   But I don't think that Callicannus has it...
[00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:51.160]   Well, wait a minute.
[00:52:51.160 --> 00:52:52.160]   Yes, here it is.
[00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:53.160]   He says, "Yes, it's true.
[00:52:53.160 --> 00:52:54.160]   I'm leaving AOL."
[00:52:54.160 --> 00:52:55.160]   Okay.
[00:52:55.160 --> 00:52:56.160]   So it's true.
[00:52:56.160 --> 00:52:57.160]   There's a little gold star next to his name.
[00:52:57.160 --> 00:52:58.520]   The most hated guest we've ever had.
[00:52:58.520 --> 00:53:06.520]   I wasn't on that show, was I?
[00:53:06.520 --> 00:53:08.200]   I was the one we did live from the Apple Store.
[00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:09.200]   Yes, you were.
[00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:11.120]   It was at the Vlogger Con.
[00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:13.000]   No, you think it was Callic?
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:14.960]   I don't remember being on there.
[00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:15.960]   Callicannus.
[00:53:15.960 --> 00:53:16.960]   It was...
[00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:18.960]   Because we couldn't hear each other.
[00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:19.960]   We couldn't hear anybody.
[00:53:19.960 --> 00:53:21.160]   You had no idea what anybody was saying.
[00:53:21.160 --> 00:53:22.160]   Yeah.
[00:53:22.160 --> 00:53:26.120]   And we had Drew from Andrew Barron from Rocket Boom on the left.
[00:53:26.120 --> 00:53:27.720]   Callicannus on the right.
[00:53:27.720 --> 00:53:29.160]   They were screaming at each other.
[00:53:29.160 --> 00:53:30.400]   Right, right, right.
[00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:32.560]   All we needed was Wozniak showing off his lasers.
[00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:34.800]   It would have been the worst tweet of all time.
[00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:35.800]   But...
[00:53:35.800 --> 00:53:38.080]   Yeah, I remember vaguely, because you couldn't hear anything.
[00:53:38.080 --> 00:53:39.080]   You couldn't hear anything.
[00:53:39.080 --> 00:53:40.680]   It was just a lot of noise.
[00:53:40.680 --> 00:53:41.680]   Scoble was there too.
[00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:42.680]   Scoble was there.
[00:53:42.680 --> 00:53:46.320]   And Dave Weiner, the guy who really made podcasting happen.
[00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:48.000]   So I run into Weiner yesterday.
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:49.000]   Oh, really?
[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:50.360]   He just shops at the same grocery store.
[00:53:50.360 --> 00:53:51.360]   I shop at it.
[00:53:51.360 --> 00:53:52.360]   He's back in town.
[00:53:52.360 --> 00:53:55.000]   Yeah, he lives in Berkeley someplace.
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:56.000]   Yeah, he came back.
[00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:58.000]   He went to Harvard for a while and he came back.
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:00.480]   When I was going to talk to him, did you say hi?
[00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:02.920]   Yeah, I said hi, you know, and I chatted for a while.
[00:54:02.920 --> 00:54:03.920]   He says, "I'm..."
[00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:04.920]   Did he try to answer the question?
[00:54:04.920 --> 00:54:05.920]   Did he try to answer the question?
[00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:06.920]   He was coming on the show.
[00:54:06.920 --> 00:54:07.920]   He should come on the show.
[00:54:07.920 --> 00:54:08.920]   I'd love to.
[00:54:08.920 --> 00:54:10.160]   Now, he says, he can do the show.
[00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:11.160]   He wants to do some of these shows.
[00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:12.160]   Oh, he wants to come on the show.
[00:54:12.160 --> 00:54:13.160]   He wants to come on the show.
[00:54:13.160 --> 00:54:14.160]   He wants to come on the show.
[00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:15.160]   He wants to come on the show.
[00:54:15.160 --> 00:54:16.160]   He wants to come on the show.
[00:54:16.160 --> 00:54:17.160]   He wants to do cranky geeks.
[00:54:17.160 --> 00:54:18.160]   He wants to do cranky geeks.
[00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:19.160]   Yes, see.
[00:54:19.160 --> 00:54:20.160]   He says, "You can get back at it."
[00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:21.160]   I guess he did.
[00:54:21.160 --> 00:54:22.160]   I don't know.
[00:54:22.160 --> 00:54:23.160]   I don't know.
[00:54:23.160 --> 00:54:24.160]   He thought he...
[00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:25.160]   He thought he...
[00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:26.160]   He was like, "Burn.
[00:54:26.160 --> 00:54:27.160]   I burned Devorak."
[00:54:27.160 --> 00:54:29.160]   He's like, "Nobody cared."
[00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:33.440]   I defy anybody to tell me what it was.
[00:54:33.440 --> 00:54:34.440]   What was the scoop?
[00:54:34.440 --> 00:54:36.160]   We'll give you a prize.
[00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:39.240]   I'll send you a twit mug.
[00:54:39.240 --> 00:54:41.840]   Now I'm in trouble because I have a twit mug.
[00:54:41.840 --> 00:54:42.840]   I want a twit mug.
[00:54:42.840 --> 00:54:43.840]   All right, all right.
[00:54:43.840 --> 00:54:46.040]   I'll have to make some twit mugs first.
[00:54:46.040 --> 00:54:47.480]   I don't want a twit mug.
[00:54:47.480 --> 00:54:48.480]   Oh, you sure?
[00:54:48.480 --> 00:54:50.640]   So anyway, I got this great titanium thing.
[00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:52.440]   I think that titanium, yes.
[00:54:52.440 --> 00:54:53.640]   I'll go for that.
[00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:57.080]   So I was, anyway, at the grocery store, he leaves and after, you know, he checks out.
[00:54:57.080 --> 00:54:58.040]   He was right in front of me.
[00:54:58.040 --> 00:54:59.960]   And I check her there.
[00:54:59.960 --> 00:55:01.360]   I said, "Boy, you know who that guy was?
[00:55:01.360 --> 00:55:02.880]   I guess a famous guy."
[00:55:02.880 --> 00:55:03.880]   She says, "Yeah."
[00:55:03.880 --> 00:55:05.360]   And I said, "Yeah, he invented blogging."
[00:55:05.360 --> 00:55:09.880]   And she says, "Yeah, whatever."
[00:55:09.880 --> 00:55:12.120]   "Burn."
[00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:14.520]   You burned him right back.
[00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:15.520]   That's funny.
[00:55:15.520 --> 00:55:17.840]   A whole lot more people heard that burn than read his burning.
[00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:19.560]   I could tell you that right now.
[00:55:19.560 --> 00:55:20.760]   That's what you said.
[00:55:20.760 --> 00:55:21.760]   Yeah, whatever.
[00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:23.320]   Well, that was a good...
[00:55:23.320 --> 00:55:24.320]   That's how the real...
[00:55:24.320 --> 00:55:28.120]   By the way, I just want everybody to know that's how the real world feels about podcasting,
[00:55:28.120 --> 00:55:34.560]   blogging, web 2.0, web 3.0, the whole world's going, "Yeah, whatever."
[00:55:34.560 --> 00:55:38.120]   Yep, that's very depressing.
[00:55:38.120 --> 00:55:39.600]   It's true.
[00:55:39.600 --> 00:55:40.600]   You're right.
[00:55:40.600 --> 00:55:45.280]   Well, it is time that the other father of podcasting, Adam Curry, yesterday.
[00:55:45.280 --> 00:55:47.480]   Oh my God, this is amazing.
[00:55:47.480 --> 00:55:49.480]   Where did you meet him?
[00:55:49.480 --> 00:55:51.120]   "PodcastConUK."
[00:55:51.120 --> 00:55:52.360]   Oh, really?
[00:55:52.360 --> 00:55:55.160]   They had a podcast like a UK version of the portable media expert.
[00:55:55.160 --> 00:55:56.160]   Right.
[00:55:56.160 --> 00:55:58.040]   And with emphasis on the word con...
[00:55:58.040 --> 00:56:01.680]   That was the in joke, yes.
[00:56:01.680 --> 00:56:02.760]   So tell me about it.
[00:56:02.760 --> 00:56:03.760]   What happened to podcast con?
[00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:04.760]   Well, he turns up...
[00:56:04.760 --> 00:56:05.760]   Apparently, he's moved to England.
[00:56:05.760 --> 00:56:06.760]   I didn't know that.
[00:56:06.760 --> 00:56:07.760]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:09.600]   He was in Belgium or somewhere and now he's back.
[00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:10.600]   Yeah.
[00:56:10.600 --> 00:56:13.320]   Well, he turns up because...
[00:56:13.320 --> 00:56:14.320]   Is it Podshow?
[00:56:14.320 --> 00:56:15.320]   Yes.
[00:56:15.320 --> 00:56:16.320]   It's his company.
[00:56:16.320 --> 00:56:23.200]   He's now got a UK version which is BT Podshow, British Telecom Podshow, who's sort of bull
[00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:24.200]   concept.
[00:56:24.200 --> 00:56:26.240]   He is a mad dealmaker that man.
[00:56:26.240 --> 00:56:27.240]   I can't believe...
[00:56:27.240 --> 00:56:28.240]   Well, he turns up the British...
[00:56:28.240 --> 00:56:31.240]   You know how much venture funding he got for Podshow?
[00:56:31.240 --> 00:56:32.240]   $1.5 million.
[00:56:32.240 --> 00:56:34.680]   Oh, it's over $15 million.
[00:56:34.680 --> 00:56:35.680]   Really?
[00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:36.680]   $15 million.
[00:56:36.680 --> 00:56:37.680]   Wikipedia says $8.5 million.
[00:56:37.680 --> 00:56:39.680]   Oh, it's behind the times.
[00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:40.680]   It's behind the times.
[00:56:40.680 --> 00:56:43.240]   But both numbers are ridiculous.
[00:56:43.240 --> 00:56:44.560]   Both numbers are ridiculous.
[00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:45.560]   Where is the...
[00:56:45.560 --> 00:56:46.560]   There's some money.
[00:56:46.560 --> 00:56:47.560]   Yeah.
[00:56:47.560 --> 00:56:48.720]   So tell me, he shows up in what?
[00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:50.520]   Is he wearing an outfit?
[00:56:50.520 --> 00:56:52.880]   An outrageous pink jumper with pink sunglasses.
[00:56:52.880 --> 00:56:53.880]   No.
[00:56:53.880 --> 00:56:55.920]   Even this raining outside and we're in the middle of Grey London, right?
[00:56:55.920 --> 00:56:56.920]   No, you could take...
[00:56:56.920 --> 00:56:57.920]   Still got the pink sunglasses.
[00:56:57.920 --> 00:57:01.040]   You could take the boy out of MTV, but you can't take the MTV out of the boy.
[00:57:01.040 --> 00:57:02.040]   That's all I can say.
[00:57:02.040 --> 00:57:03.040]   Right.
[00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:04.040]   And he was really interesting.
[00:57:04.040 --> 00:57:06.120]   Even though he's like 63 now.
[00:57:06.120 --> 00:57:09.720]   He's still got the long blonde hair and the pink jumper.
[00:57:09.720 --> 00:57:10.720]   Yeah.
[00:57:10.720 --> 00:57:13.680]   And he sat in the corner as basically just chatting to people who were coming up and...
[00:57:13.680 --> 00:57:15.920]   That's like Grandpa Munster.
[00:57:15.920 --> 00:57:16.920]   And he was...
[00:57:16.920 --> 00:57:18.920]   That's really bad at all.
[00:57:18.920 --> 00:57:20.920]   And he was just...
[00:57:20.920 --> 00:57:21.920]   He had a few questions about...
[00:57:21.920 --> 00:57:26.920]   Whatever happened to Graceful, aging Graceful, that's all I ask.
[00:57:26.920 --> 00:57:29.080]   And throwing some quipsary.
[00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:30.080]   What was it?
[00:57:30.080 --> 00:57:32.440]   So he was kind of like the bad boy in the corner.
[00:57:32.440 --> 00:57:33.600]   Is that what he was doing?
[00:57:33.600 --> 00:57:34.600]   Yeah.
[00:57:34.600 --> 00:57:35.600]   And people were just like saying hello.
[00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:36.600]   And he was throwing out.
[00:57:36.600 --> 00:57:37.600]   I think...
[00:57:37.600 --> 00:57:41.280]   Did you have to kiss his ring when you come up to him or...?
[00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:42.880]   He has got quite a big ring, isn't he?
[00:57:42.880 --> 00:57:44.680]   Because I've kissed it.
[00:57:44.680 --> 00:57:46.480]   Well, kissing is...
[00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:47.480]   You kissed it?
[00:57:47.480 --> 00:57:48.480]   It's not exactly kissing.
[00:57:48.480 --> 00:57:49.480]   But anyway...
[00:57:49.480 --> 00:57:57.880]   He was just throwing quotes at how dig was never going to be worth anything.
[00:57:57.880 --> 00:57:59.520]   That it was just like a passing fad.
[00:57:59.520 --> 00:58:00.520]   You know what?
[00:58:00.520 --> 00:58:02.120]   You want to know the sad thing on that dig story?
[00:58:02.120 --> 00:58:04.280]   Why did he get brain damage?
[00:58:04.280 --> 00:58:07.000]   No, because he has eight and a half million.
[00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:08.000]   He knows.
[00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:09.880]   Well, yeah.
[00:58:09.880 --> 00:58:12.520]   Dig's never going to be worth anything.
[00:58:12.520 --> 00:58:13.520]   It's just my ring.
[00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:14.520]   I've got a pink jumper.
[00:58:14.520 --> 00:58:16.400]   So you don't like Adam, I take it?
[00:58:16.400 --> 00:58:17.760]   No, I'm just teasing him.
[00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:18.760]   I don't...
[00:58:18.760 --> 00:58:19.760]   Well, he said...
[00:58:19.760 --> 00:58:22.120]   He said, right, this is the best quote from him all day.
[00:58:22.120 --> 00:58:23.120]   I said...
[00:58:23.120 --> 00:58:24.120]   It's nice to meet you, Adam.
[00:58:24.120 --> 00:58:25.280]   I actually do a podcast.
[00:58:25.280 --> 00:58:26.280]   I'm on the...
[00:58:26.280 --> 00:58:27.280]   By a friend of my Leela port.
[00:58:27.280 --> 00:58:28.280]   I do this week in tech.
[00:58:28.280 --> 00:58:29.920]   He said, "Oh, yes, I know this week in tech."
[00:58:29.920 --> 00:58:30.920]   Oh, yeah, he knows it.
[00:58:30.920 --> 00:58:35.320]   No, he said, "Generally, all I do is I check the website to see if Devorex on.
[00:58:35.320 --> 00:58:36.960]   If Devorex on, I'll download it."
[00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:37.960]   Oh, interesting.
[00:58:37.960 --> 00:58:38.960]   Well, he's got good times.
[00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:39.960]   Wow, he's a smart guy.
[00:58:39.960 --> 00:58:44.960]   So obviously Adam Curry is your biggest fan junk.
[00:58:44.960 --> 00:58:47.160]   Yeah, I really don't think so.
[00:58:47.160 --> 00:58:49.400]   Adam's a great guy and really there would be no podcast.
[00:58:49.400 --> 00:58:52.560]   You know, he used to be a scene at in the early days and they got rid of him for some
[00:58:52.560 --> 00:58:53.560]   unknown reason.
[00:58:53.560 --> 00:58:55.480]   He was quite the visionary.
[00:58:55.480 --> 00:58:59.560]   I mean, when he was at MTV, he left and started an ISP.
[00:58:59.560 --> 00:59:00.560]   I mean...
[00:59:00.560 --> 00:59:02.120]   Yeah, no, he was a Visa Sharp operator.
[00:59:02.120 --> 00:59:03.120]   I'm surprised.
[00:59:03.120 --> 00:59:04.120]   You know, I think...
[00:59:04.120 --> 00:59:09.000]   I remember I was in Europe in the late '90s before the dot-com bus and I was reading one
[00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:13.920]   of these, I think it was a Dutch paper talking about him, how he's worth $100 million and
[00:59:13.920 --> 00:59:16.800]   he's very good at promoting himself.
[00:59:16.800 --> 00:59:17.800]   And I couldn't figure out...
[00:59:17.800 --> 00:59:18.800]   Yeah, I'm thinking, "Wow."
[00:59:18.800 --> 00:59:21.760]   You know, because he owned all this stuff and then I don't know what happened.
[00:59:21.760 --> 00:59:24.680]   And then next thing you know, he's doing a bunch of other stuff.
[00:59:24.680 --> 00:59:31.280]   And so I think he's become a mysterious person and so far as what he's worth, what money
[00:59:31.280 --> 00:59:32.280]   he's actually...
[00:59:32.280 --> 00:59:33.280]   Well, I'll tell you what.
[00:59:33.280 --> 00:59:36.080]   I've got $20 right here for you, Adam.
[00:59:36.080 --> 00:59:39.640]   US cash on the table if you want to be on Twitch.
[00:59:39.640 --> 00:59:40.640]   Just come on by.
[00:59:40.640 --> 00:59:42.840]   $20 waiting for you.
[00:59:42.840 --> 00:59:45.360]   He probably used a Skype, I bet.
[00:59:45.360 --> 00:59:47.400]   I bet he's heard of Skype.
[00:59:47.400 --> 00:59:49.680]   Anyway, yeah, it'd be fun to talk about.
[00:59:49.680 --> 00:59:50.920]   So was podcast content fun?
[00:59:50.920 --> 00:59:54.400]   A podcast UK con podcast fun?
[00:59:54.400 --> 00:59:55.400]   Yeah.
[00:59:55.400 --> 00:59:57.240]   I think it was a big...
[00:59:57.240 --> 00:59:58.240]   It was interesting.
[00:59:58.240 --> 01:00:00.320]   No, it was like maybe 150 people.
[01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:04.840]   My sense is that while we have global listeners to podcasting, there's not a lot of...
[01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:07.480]   You know, not a lot of podcasts produced outside the US.
[01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:11.480]   I mean, I've talked to Danish podcasters and I asked them, well, how many are there?
[01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:13.520]   They said, "Oh, you know, a dozen.
[01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:15.800]   A France, you know, there's a dozen.
[01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:16.800]   They're not a lot of...
[01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:17.800]   Maybe UK there.
[01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:18.800]   Well, they were quite a lot.
[01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:21.200]   Yeah, basically everybody there was a podcaster.
[01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:22.200]   Yeah.
[01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:23.200]   So there's about 150 or so.
[01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:24.840]   Yeah, it was 150 people you said.
[01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:25.840]   Well, that's it.
[01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:26.840]   Yeah.
[01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:27.840]   That's the total.
[01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:28.840]   It was terrible.
[01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:29.840]   Well, maybe.
[01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:32.840]   Well, you know, there were 2,500 people at Podcast Expo in the US and I think every one
[01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:35.360]   of them were podcasters.
[01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:39.240]   I would not hesitate to doubt that.
[01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:40.240]   But what was...
[01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:41.240]   Go ahead, get the phone.
[01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:45.200]   I mean, it was pretty funny that, you know, there was this...
[01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:50.680]   You know, somebody made a flip and remark like, "We need to get podcasting to the mainstream
[01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:51.680]   to the mass audiences."
[01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:52.680]   I agree.
[01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:53.680]   How do we do that?
[01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:56.240]   And they said, you know, the trouble is that we all know what podcasting is, but nobody
[01:00:56.240 --> 01:00:57.240]   else does.
[01:00:57.240 --> 01:01:01.840]   And I thought, really, does everybody know, you know, in this room, know what podcasting
[01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:07.080]   is given that, you know, some people think that podcasting is just like a flat distribution
[01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:08.080]   medium for audio.
[01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:10.840]   Some people want to attach like a bunch of social norms to it.
[01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:14.840]   Like, podcasting is about independent media and sticking it to the man.
[01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:15.840]   Yeah.
[01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:19.360]   You know, podcasting is not about advertising or podcasting is exactly about advertising.
[01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:21.360]   It's a commercial, you know, too.
[01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:25.400]   It reminds me, by the way, that this podcast is brought to you by Dell computers if you
[01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:26.400]   would like to check out.
[01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:27.400]   That was smooth.
[01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:28.400]   And that's a segue.
[01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:30.400]   That wasn't smooth at all.
[01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:31.400]   It's about so-and-smooth.
[01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:32.400]   It was so cool.
[01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:34.400]   I just can't get over it.
[01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:37.080]   I was just changed my underwear.
[01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:38.600]   You did such a great job about it.
[01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:40.480]   But why don't you give Dell their due?
[01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:41.880]   I think you are overdoable.
[01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:43.520]   I need to say something about that.
[01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:49.080]   Because without their financial support, why we wouldn't be able to buy John's underwear.
[01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:54.360]   So if you would like to check out the latest Leo's picks, they're there at twit.tv/dell.
[01:01:54.360 --> 01:01:57.320]   Campaign's been going very well, by the way, and we thank the folks at Dell for their support.
[01:01:57.320 --> 01:02:01.440]   And thank you, more importantly, the Twit listeners for using that link when you go
[01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:02.600]   to Dell to buy a computer.
[01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:04.760]   A lot of people get in those VISTA-ready computers.
[01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:08.200]   You get your VISTA Express upgrade from Dell, and you get a very inexpensive upgrade to
[01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:13.840]   VISTA when the operating system comes up in January 30th, I think is the day.
[01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:15.640]   But your Dell is waiting for you today.
[01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:18.640]   Twit.tv/dell.
[01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:20.640]   We were talking about-
[01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:21.640]   That was amazing.
[01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:22.640]   What you like then?
[01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:25.440]   Yeah, now let's trash VISTA.
[01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:32.120]   Well, no, my attitude is if you have to run Windows, you should run it on Dell.
[01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:35.200]   You know, most people that are running VISTA, they're liking it.
[01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:36.200]   It's pretty.
[01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:37.600]   Well, yeah, that's why it's pretty.
[01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:42.720]   Actually, VISTA has a lot of cool stuff in it, but I think that a lot of people don't
[01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:47.200]   understand the difference between VISTA-capable and VISTA-premium-ready.
[01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:51.000]   You won't get aero glass if you only get VISTA-capable.
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.640]   If you want the visuals, you have to get premium-ready, right?
[01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:54.640]   What's the difference?
[01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:55.640]   That's the difference.
[01:02:55.640 --> 01:02:58.520]   No, is there a difference in the hardware?
[01:02:58.520 --> 01:02:59.680]   Yeah.
[01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:05.080]   You can make VISTA run on an older, slower machine, but it's not going to do all of its
[01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:06.080]   stuff.
[01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:07.080]   Well, it's all cosmetic, though.
[01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:09.080]   I mean, it's not like it won't have the function.
[01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:10.080]   Well, it's not like it won't have the function.
[01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:11.080]   Well, it's not like it won't have the function.
[01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:12.080]   Cosmetics are important.
[01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:13.080]   Specifically, I'll give you the specifics.
[01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:17.520]   512 megs-ram for VISTA-ready, or VISTA-capable, I should say.
[01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:21.600]   A gig for VISTA- what is it, premium-ready?
[01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:22.600]   No problem there.
[01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:23.600]   We all got that.
[01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:26.720]   You've got to have both of them have to be direct X9 video cards, but you need to have
[01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:30.240]   one that does hardware pixel shading, 2.0.
[01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:31.840]   And frankly, you need enough video RAM.
[01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:37.080]   If you want to run a megapixel screen, it's 64 megabytes of video RAM.
[01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:38.080]   If you want a two megapixel screen--
[01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:40.600]   I think these high-end and video cards do all that stuff.
[01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:41.600]   Oh, yeah.
[01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:42.600]   Oh, yeah.
[01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:43.600]   All right.
[01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:44.600]   All right.
[01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:45.600]   The card's do it.
[01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:46.600]   That's not the issue.
[01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:47.600]   Its motherboard video may not.
[01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:48.600]   You know, only the GMA 950 does.
[01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:49.600]   I don't know.
[01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:51.240]   You know, that new AMD motherboard video is pretty hot.
[01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:52.240]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:53.240]   No, absolutely.
[01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:54.240]   Sure, it's really--
[01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:55.920]   Oh, it's got Nvidia on it.
[01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:56.920]   Right.
[01:03:56.920 --> 01:03:57.920]   No, that's ATI.
[01:03:57.920 --> 01:03:58.920]   Yeah, that's ATI.
[01:03:58.920 --> 01:03:59.920]   ATI.
[01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:01.760]   So, what do you think?
[01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:04.320]   Is it worth upgrading your video card for--
[01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:05.320]   Stop.
[01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:06.320]   Stop.
[01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:07.320]   Is that it?
[01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:09.120]   No, that's not it.
[01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:14.400]   The real difference is on laptops, and the real difference is on these hybrid disk drives.
[01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:15.400]   Oh, okay.
[01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:17.800]   Fine, but what does that got to do with mathematics?
[01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:19.040]   We've talked about hybrid before.
[01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:20.200]   I want to know what this is.
[01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:21.440]   What is a hybrid disk drive?
[01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:23.520]   I can't tell you what it is.
[01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:25.360]   We all know what it is.
[01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:27.120]   Well, I don't know.
[01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:30.000]   Okay, Bill, you tell me what it is.
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:34.160]   Okay, it's Flash Memory built into your hard disk.
[01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:35.160]   Oh, I knew that.
[01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:38.200]   It stores all of your most popular sectors.
[01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:39.200]   It's a cache.
[01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:40.200]   It's a fast cache.
[01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:41.200]   Yeah.
[01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:42.200]   We talked about this last week, I remember now.
[01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:43.200]   Yeah, but it's a permanent cache.
[01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:48.160]   So, you're not VISTA premium ready if you don't have a hybrid hard drive?
[01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:53.640]   You can't even run VISTA premium on a, I'm not sure you can run VISTA at all on an older
[01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:58.200]   laptop that doesn't have a hybrid drive.
[01:04:58.200 --> 01:04:59.840]   So VISTA itself won't run?
[01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:01.480]   I'm not sure of that.
[01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:03.000]   I'm sorry, you can't run it.
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:04.600]   It's just aero glass, you lose.
[01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:05.600]   Yeah.
[01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:06.600]   No, I don't think you have anything to do with that.
[01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:08.400]   I just think it runs crummy.
[01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:10.440]   It runs really poorly.
[01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:12.960]   It's designed.
[01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:17.360]   How about if I have a big, you know, an 8 meg RAM cache?
[01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:18.360]   Is that enough?
[01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:23.360]   No, actually, you know, huge cache.
[01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:29.960]   VISTA is talking specifically through a series of APIs to that disk drives Flash Memory.
[01:05:29.960 --> 01:05:32.520]   But is that only on laptops, not desktops?
[01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:33.520]   No, desktop.
[01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:36.320]   You want to use it on a desktop too, but that's my understanding.
[01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:40.320]   Yeah, there are some new, I think Samsung has a...
[01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:43.680]   Samsung's got one, yeah.
[01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:47.960]   An ATA flash drive that, you just plug it into the ATA socket.
[01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:49.440]   Oh, it adds it.
[01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:51.600]   And it acts like, oh, I just have an ATA.
[01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:56.600]   Well, I understand that Bill, at least somebody was telling me this the other day and I was
[01:05:56.600 --> 01:05:59.000]   thinking, well, that's pretty cool if this works.
[01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:05.240]   A lot of the newer thumb drives, if you stick them in, you're at USB port and all of a sudden
[01:06:05.240 --> 01:06:07.240]   says, well, we'll just use this.
[01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:08.240]   No.
[01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:09.240]   Yes.
[01:06:09.240 --> 01:06:10.240]   And the U3 or is...
[01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:12.880]   No, no, it's not U3, it's just something else.
[01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:13.880]   It's got to be fast.
[01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:15.600]   It's got to be fast.
[01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:16.600]   And the trick is...
[01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:17.600]   But they're not that fast.
[01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:19.160]   They're not as fast as a hard drive.
[01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:20.160]   Are they?
[01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:21.600]   The new ones are pretty fast.
[01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:22.600]   Yeah.
[01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:27.760]   And the thing is that hard drives are a lot slower than we think they are when they're
[01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:31.800]   doing random reads and basically they're all random reads.
[01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:38.960]   So you're saying a USB 2.0 flash thumb drive is faster than my hard drive?
[01:06:38.960 --> 01:06:39.960]   For sequential reads?
[01:06:39.960 --> 01:06:40.960]   Yeah.
[01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:41.960]   Wow.
[01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:46.200]   Because what Vista will do is line up all of your most popular sectors, the things that
[01:06:46.200 --> 01:06:51.960]   you load when you start up your machine or when you come out of sleep mode and it will
[01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:59.560]   just stream them serially onto memory and execute them and that is wicked fast.
[01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:03.640]   So the real issue is that the architecture of Vista requires this kind of support.
[01:07:03.640 --> 01:07:06.640]   Yeah, it really doesn't require it.
[01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:07.640]   It doesn't require it.
[01:07:07.640 --> 01:07:08.640]   It wants it.
[01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:09.640]   But in order to run...
[01:07:09.640 --> 01:07:10.640]   Wants it bad.
[01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:11.640]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:12.640]   Wants it bad.
[01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:18.000]   It's like a nymphomaniac.
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:24.080]   So if an nymphomaniac really liked hybrid hard drives?
[01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:30.360]   Well maybe John remembers the last time we said in PC Magazine, don't upgrade by new
[01:07:30.360 --> 01:07:31.440]   to support the operating system.
[01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:33.920]   This is the case it sounds like.
[01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:37.320]   And I think we're at that juncture again and it's been a long, long time.
[01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:41.240]   And don't buy Vista capable by Vista premium ready.
[01:07:41.240 --> 01:07:43.160]   That's my story.
[01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:48.360]   The difference in price is probably not enough to make it worth the pain and suffer.
[01:07:48.360 --> 01:07:49.360]   Don't people...
[01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:53.080]   Doesn't the industry understand how confusing this is?
[01:07:53.080 --> 01:07:54.640]   Well it's totally confusing.
[01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:55.640]   It's pathetically confusing.
[01:07:55.640 --> 01:07:56.640]   A customer goes in.
[01:07:56.640 --> 01:07:57.640]   Is there anything we miss?
[01:07:57.640 --> 01:07:59.560]   Well, Will has been following this pretty closely.
[01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:02.360]   I want to know if we've missed anything in this discussion.
[01:08:02.360 --> 01:08:03.840]   Yeah, go ahead.
[01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:08.840]   I don't think so.
[01:08:08.840 --> 01:08:13.840]   I think the hybrid hard drives have been really interesting.
[01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:15.840]   I don't get that at all.
[01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:21.760]   But even while there's two different technologies, one is Vista ready drive and one is Vista
[01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:24.280]   ready boost.
[01:08:24.280 --> 01:08:29.120]   You can make your USB key do two different things depending on the figure you can do.
[01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:31.560]   Consumers are going to walk away from the store.
[01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:35.200]   They're going to say, "Wait a minute, this is Vista capable, Vista premium ready, Vista
[01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:36.800]   super premium booster capable.
[01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:37.800]   What the hell?"
[01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:38.800]   Oh, they're not going to do that.
[01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:41.880]   Leo, what they're going to do is there's going to be some guy on the floor who's been
[01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:42.880]   paid off.
[01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:43.880]   Well, why?
[01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:47.440]   Buy this or buy that or buy this or buy that and they're just going to do that and they'll
[01:08:47.440 --> 01:08:51.480]   be pleased this punch when they finally get the machine home and maybe they may or may
[01:08:51.480 --> 01:08:52.840]   not have the best thing going.
[01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:55.640]   And that's why you need to read PC magazine.
[01:08:55.640 --> 01:08:57.160]   I mean, that's why you need to keep up.
[01:08:57.160 --> 01:08:58.720]   That's why you need to listen to these podcasts.
[01:08:58.720 --> 01:09:03.280]   So if you're going to be competing with the guy next to you in the cubicle, you better
[01:09:03.280 --> 01:09:04.280]   learn something.
[01:09:04.280 --> 01:09:06.000]   So let's simplify it.
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:07.000]   What do I need?
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000]   Tell me what I need.
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:10.000]   Bill?
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:15.040]   If you have a laptop machine, first of all, buy new.
[01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:16.480]   Buy new is the first advice.
[01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:18.160]   Don't upgrade to Vista.
[01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:24.440]   If you buy a Vista ready laptop, it's going to have a hybrid hard disk in it.
[01:09:24.440 --> 01:09:25.440]   Vista premium ready.
[01:09:25.440 --> 01:09:26.440]   Right.
[01:09:26.440 --> 01:09:27.440]   Not Vista capable.
[01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:34.960]   Actually, I do not believe that there is such a thing as a Vista capable laptop.
[01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:43.720]   I believe that Microsoft is requiring the hybrid hard disk in all Vista certified laptop hardware.
[01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:44.960]   I think so too.
[01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:45.960]   Okay.
[01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:51.520]   So Vista premium ready laptop would be able to do all this and would have the right video
[01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:52.720]   card too, right?
[01:09:52.720 --> 01:09:53.720]   So I could do air or glass.
[01:09:53.720 --> 01:09:54.720]   It would be.
[01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:57.760]   It would perform at a decent clip.
[01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:02.120]   They will not sell any low capability laptops.
[01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:03.800]   And it's not going to cost that much.
[01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:07.400]   No, I think the prices won't change all that much.
[01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:09.840]   I think you're looking at maybe a delta of a hundred bucks.
[01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:11.320]   Because flash is pretty astounding.
[01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:12.480]   About a hundred bucks.
[01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:13.480]   Yeah.
[01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:14.480]   All right.
[01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:15.720]   And they will perform very well.
[01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:20.280]   They won't just be, you know, I think these are going to be really surprising machines.
[01:10:20.280 --> 01:10:21.960]   Come out of sleep mode in a second.
[01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:22.960]   Oh, I like that.
[01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:25.560]   You mean just like a Mac.
[01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:27.760]   Yeah, but they don't blow up.
[01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:28.760]   That's the difference.
[01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:29.760]   Oh, come on.
[01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:32.760]   Put a Sony battery in any computer will blow up.
[01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:34.360]   You've got me.
[01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:37.280]   Nice to have that option.
[01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:42.560]   So I might as well take my spanking now on 64 bit versus 32 bit.
[01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:48.480]   We talked on security now last week about 64 bit Vista being the only really secure
[01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:49.480]   Vista.
[01:10:49.480 --> 01:10:52.120]   But of course, because of the driver issues, you got all new drivers.
[01:10:52.120 --> 01:10:54.760]   There's a lot of hardware is not going to work.
[01:10:54.760 --> 01:10:59.080]   And I was mistaken in what processors I thought I needed to buy a Xeon.
[01:10:59.080 --> 01:11:00.080]   But I don't, right?
[01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:02.840]   Well, a core two is fine.
[01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:04.640]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:09.040]   All the latest core to stuff comes with 64 bit capability.
[01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:12.320]   But at this point, we're not going to do every MDC BU that you can buy.
[01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:13.320]   Right.
[01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:15.280]   We're not going to say go out and get Vista 64 though.
[01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:17.720]   Well, unless you want security, right?
[01:11:17.720 --> 01:11:21.120]   For security, it's great, but it won't run anything.
[01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:23.120]   If I were running, if I were buying a Vista.
[01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:24.120]   You're like being on a Mac.
[01:11:24.120 --> 01:11:25.120]   Can you buy?
[01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:31.400]   Is there a Vista premium ready 64 capable sticker?
[01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:35.960]   You've managed to confuse us now.
[01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:37.600]   Because that's what I want.
[01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:39.160]   There's not necessarily a sticker.
[01:11:39.160 --> 01:11:42.640]   But if you go out, if you go and buy, let me get this right.
[01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:44.520]   Because I want one that has all the right hardware.
[01:11:44.520 --> 01:11:46.120]   So the driver's working everything, right?
[01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:48.120]   I'm almost completely sure.
[01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:50.120]   No, but there's a stickler.
[01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:52.120]   Yeah.
[01:11:52.120 --> 01:11:55.640]   You can get the latest high end laptop from Dell.
[01:11:55.640 --> 01:12:02.280]   And I am 90% sure that'll be Vista premium capable ready awesome.
[01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:03.280]   64-bit.
[01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:04.280]   64-bit.
[01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:05.280]   Yeah.
[01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:06.280]   I want a 64-bit Schmekki.
[01:12:06.280 --> 01:12:07.280]   Yeah.
[01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:08.280]   OK.
[01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:09.280]   That's right.
[01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:13.240]   The new Core 2 Duo or the AMD based will run Vista 64.
[01:12:13.240 --> 01:12:14.240]   OK.
[01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:15.880]   So I'm going to put that in one of my Leo's picks.
[01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:18.560]   Because I know I want to cut through.
[01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:22.080]   I want to be the guy on the showroom floor.
[01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:26.720]   In effect, the virtual-- the Web 2.0 showroom floor where you go to and I say just buy this
[01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:28.280]   and forget it.
[01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:30.720]   And we'll put that in the Leo's picks page.
[01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:32.720]   That's Web 3 Leo.
[01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:33.720]   That's usability.
[01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:36.280]   That's the New York Times thing.
[01:12:36.280 --> 01:12:37.280]   That's right.
[01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:39.520]   John Markov making the technology disappear.
[01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:44.440]   Your buddy John C. Devork, your buddy John Markov announced what Web 3.0 was.
[01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:46.200]   I can't believe that story.
[01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:48.400]   So can you summarize it here, John?
[01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:50.680]   No, I can't because there's no such thing as Web 3.0.
[01:12:50.680 --> 01:12:54.240]   He was talking about-- he says Web 2.0 is social interaction, right?
[01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:55.240]   What is Web 3.0?
[01:12:55.240 --> 01:12:56.240]   That's not what it is.
[01:12:56.240 --> 01:12:57.240]   That's bull.
[01:12:57.240 --> 01:12:58.240]   It's like one of many things.
[01:12:58.240 --> 01:12:59.240]   If you look at the--
[01:12:59.240 --> 01:13:00.240]   Go to a Riley site.
[01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:01.240]   And look-- well, yeah.
[01:13:01.240 --> 01:13:02.240]   Ajax is part of it.
[01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:04.680]   And that's what's that got to do with social interaction.
[01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:07.120]   If you go to a Riley site, you can see what it is.
[01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:10.320]   It's basically Web.1 that's been upgraded.
[01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:12.040]   And it's an item by item thing.
[01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:13.680]   It's not like this has been upgraded to that.
[01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:18.000]   And there's all these different things that used to be in Web 1.0 during the .com thing.
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.960]   And they've changed the terminology and they've changed what it does.
[01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:22.760]   So what does Markov say 3 is?
[01:13:22.760 --> 01:13:25.360]   I don't know what the point of that article was, to be honest.
[01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:26.360]   I read it.
[01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:27.680]   It was on the front page of the New York Times.
[01:13:27.680 --> 01:13:28.680]   I was trying to figure it out.
[01:13:28.680 --> 01:13:29.680]   That was the point.
[01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:30.680]   That was the point.
[01:13:30.680 --> 01:13:33.440]   The point was that John now gets bragging rights to say--
[01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:35.240]   I coined-- I coined Web 3.0.
[01:13:35.240 --> 01:13:36.240]   Yeah.
[01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:37.240]   Well, you know what?
[01:13:37.240 --> 01:13:38.240]   I'm announcing it right here now.
[01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:39.240]   Web 4.0.
[01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:42.080]   You know, actually, it's funny.
[01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:45.200]   We were talking to Mike Harrington, who is really the kind of the guy at TechCrunch's
[01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:46.960]   his blog on Web 2.0.
[01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:49.440]   He said, "I don't know how he registered Web 3.0."
[01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:52.640]   So I think you've got to start it for, and it might be even more.
[01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:53.640]   I mean, fine with four.
[01:13:53.640 --> 01:13:54.640]   OK.
[01:13:54.640 --> 01:13:55.640]   John's got four.
[01:13:55.640 --> 01:13:56.640]   Anybody want five?
[01:13:56.640 --> 01:13:57.640]   Anybody want five?
[01:13:57.640 --> 01:14:02.080]   I think five is nano implantation into your brain.
[01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:03.080]   It's a whole bit.
[01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:04.080]   It's five.
[01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:06.720]   By then, we're all, you know, the web goes to something else.
[01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:09.200]   Well, I think five will be Vista-ready.
[01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:11.120]   I think there's no doubt about that.
[01:14:11.120 --> 01:14:12.120]   We're hoping.
[01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:13.120]   We're convinced of that.
[01:14:13.120 --> 01:14:14.120]   Bug free.
[01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:15.120]   Bug free.
[01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:16.120]   I did a story for Twit.
[01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:17.120]   We'd love you to do it.
[01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:19.040]   All you have to do is create a delicious account.
[01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:21.480]   I showed Will Harris how to do that today.
[01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:24.480]   And then tag any story for Colin Twitt.
[01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:27.520]   Boy, that sounds bad for Colin Twitt.
[01:14:27.520 --> 01:14:33.360]   Do you have a web page on the Twitt.tv website that describes this process for people?
[01:14:33.360 --> 01:14:34.960]   No, but I could.
[01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:35.960]   I think you showed it.
[01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:36.960]   I have the technology.
[01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:40.640]   Yeah, it's called a text editor.
[01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:44.640]   Twitt.tv is the website where you see this podcast, but lots of other ones.
[01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:48.160]   Please subscribe to them and make me rich.
[01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:49.800]   What else?
[01:14:49.800 --> 01:14:56.520]   JohnC.vorak.org/blog is where John is counting his pennies.
[01:14:56.520 --> 01:15:00.880]   And as it were, and of course, market watch and the many, many other columns.
[01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:01.880]   DC Magazine.
[01:15:01.880 --> 01:15:02.880]   DC Magazine.
[01:15:02.880 --> 01:15:03.880]   Columns are great magazine.
[01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:04.880]   That's where Bill McCrone can be found as well.
[01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:05.880]   Go ahead.
[01:15:05.880 --> 01:15:08.760]   Also in info in Brazil.
[01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:11.520]   Also Bug Magazine in Croatia, just to throw these extra plugs in.
[01:15:11.520 --> 01:15:12.520]   I love that.
[01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:13.520]   No, give them plugs.
[01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:14.520]   Why not?
[01:15:14.520 --> 01:15:17.840]   They should read you.
[01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:19.680]   In Porto Gaze.
[01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:22.480]   Bill McCrone is in PC Magazine and he has his own website.
[01:15:22.480 --> 01:15:24.960]   Is it macrone.home.comcast.net?
[01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:25.960]   Is that right?
[01:15:25.960 --> 01:15:26.960]   Let's see.
[01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:28.440]   Let's see.
[01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:33.320]   You can get to any of my various places by McCrone.net.
[01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:34.320]   McCrone.net.
[01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:35.320]   Yeah.
[01:15:35.320 --> 01:15:38.280]   And you can also just type McCrone into Google and I'm sure you'll get there.
[01:15:38.280 --> 01:15:43.640]   You know, I bet if I just type McCrone into my Firefox address bar, I'd probably go to
[01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:44.640]   you.
[01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:45.640]   Yeah, it's amazing how that works.
[01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:46.640]   It's pretty smart about that.
[01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:50.160]   Well, now pulled up Google, but it did pull up the right thing.
[01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:57.480]   And of course, Will Harris is the editor in chief and a great columnist for bit-tech.net,
[01:15:57.480 --> 01:16:01.040]   the UK's number one enthusiast website.
[01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:03.360]   I just coined that for you.
[01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:04.360]   Thank you very much.
[01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:10.600]   And Adam Curry can be heard every single day on the daily source code at curry.com.
[01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:15.840]   Hey, we'll see if you can get down to pay for curry to come on.
[01:16:15.840 --> 01:16:17.440]   You should fly out.
[01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:19.440]   I want him to sit here in the Twitter headquarters.
[01:16:19.440 --> 01:16:20.440]   Just put him on Skype.
[01:16:20.440 --> 01:16:21.560]   He'll be happy camper.
[01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:28.440]   You know, Adam was actually the thing about dig, which is really sad, is that, you know,
[01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:32.360]   Murdoch offered well over a hundred million dollars for dig.
[01:16:32.360 --> 01:16:34.240]   And it wasn't Kevin.
[01:16:34.240 --> 01:16:36.000]   It wasn't Owen.
[01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:37.200]   I don't think he was even Jay.
[01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:40.960]   None of the principles there, they all wanted to take it.
[01:16:40.960 --> 01:16:42.360]   Believe me, they wanted to take it.
[01:16:42.360 --> 01:16:44.840]   And that's what happens when you take investors.
[01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:48.840]   The investors said, "No, we're worth 150 or nothing."
[01:16:48.840 --> 01:16:52.240]   You know, I can't believe for me that the two founders couldn't push that one through.
[01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:53.440]   Boy, you'd think so.
[01:16:53.440 --> 01:16:56.720]   But I haven't talked to Kevin about it, but I've heard from very good sources that Kevin
[01:16:56.720 --> 01:16:57.880]   wanted to take it.
[01:16:57.880 --> 01:16:58.880]   He wanted to take it.
[01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:03.320]   Well, he's worth, I think he really would, if they'd gotten us a hundred million, he
[01:17:03.320 --> 01:17:06.800]   would have been worth that 60 million that business week said he was worth.
[01:17:06.800 --> 01:17:07.800]   It's kind of sad.
[01:17:07.800 --> 01:17:09.400]   Well, it probably wouldn't have been that.
[01:17:09.400 --> 01:17:10.680]   The investors would take a big piece.
[01:17:10.680 --> 01:17:12.320]   He'd probably, he'd been worth some good money.
[01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:14.080]   I'll tell you this much, he'd be buying.
[01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:15.080]   He'd be buying.
[01:17:15.080 --> 01:17:16.520]   And we keep telling Kevin that.
[01:17:16.520 --> 01:17:17.520]   We'll get him back on the show.
[01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:22.360]   Patrick couldn't be here because he was at the Baja 500 and he's still coated with dust.
[01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:25.520]   But once we hose him down, he'll be back on Twit properly next week.
[01:17:25.520 --> 01:17:26.520]   I'm Leo LaPorte.
[01:17:26.520 --> 01:17:27.840]   Well, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:17:27.840 --> 01:17:28.840]   We'll see you next week.
[01:17:28.840 --> 01:17:30.480]   Another Twit is in the can.
[01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:56.000]   That was a damn fine episode.
[01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:57.960]   I just fell over the road, but I liked it.
[01:17:57.960 --> 01:18:00.960]   I learned so much.
[01:18:00.960 --> 01:18:02.440]   But we all learned so much.
[01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:04.200]   Let's get back to DMCA.
[01:18:04.200 --> 01:18:09.160]   Why do you keep turning us up, Leo?
[01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:12.960]   You know, the story we didn't cover was Yahoo's going to have a big shake up a little bit.
[01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:13.960]   What's going on there?
[01:18:13.960 --> 01:18:15.960]   Is that a big story that you were going to break?
[01:18:15.960 --> 01:18:17.200]   No, I broke the story.
[01:18:17.200 --> 01:18:19.680]   It's about the UAE banning devoreact.org.
[01:18:19.680 --> 01:18:20.680]   That was the big story.
[01:18:20.680 --> 01:18:25.280]   And you know something about a shake up a Yahoo, but the UAE banning your blog was the
[01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:26.280]   big story.
[01:18:26.280 --> 01:18:27.280]   I think so.
[01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:29.280]   The shake up a Yahoo's everywhere.
[01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:30.280]   It's a lot.
[01:18:30.280 --> 01:18:31.280]   What's the shake up a yada?
[01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:32.280]   What's going on?
[01:18:32.280 --> 01:18:36.640]   I think they're going to put Rosen Swig and the CFO as the co-president.
[01:18:36.640 --> 01:18:37.640]   Really?
[01:18:37.640 --> 01:18:38.640]   What was it?
[01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:39.640]   The dance one of ours.
[01:18:39.640 --> 01:18:40.640]   The dance is a good guy.
[01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:41.640]   I like it.
[01:18:41.640 --> 01:18:46.640]   And then they're going to probably fire up the represent the company or something.
[01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:47.640]   Wow.
[01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:48.640]   Because they buy loads of crappy social media.
[01:18:48.640 --> 01:18:49.640]   Well, they just did that, though.
[01:18:49.640 --> 01:18:50.640]   Didn't they just go on a shopping spree?
[01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:51.640]   I don't understand.
[01:18:51.640 --> 01:18:55.800]   Maybe I need to go and get down to Yahoo and get to my bet tech.
[01:18:55.800 --> 01:18:56.800]   That'd work.
[01:18:56.800 --> 01:19:04.280]   No, I think a small struggling technology podcast network would make a wonderful purchase.
[01:19:04.280 --> 01:19:06.200]   Perhaps, still key of struggling.
[01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:08.200]   No, the use of the word struggling.
[01:19:08.200 --> 01:19:09.200]   A to what?
[01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:10.200]   No one's getting the struggling.
[01:19:10.200 --> 01:19:11.200]   Oh, yeah, yeah.
[01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:12.200]   Not struggling.
[01:19:12.200 --> 01:19:13.200]   A mouth to break out.
[01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:14.200]   You can't cash the checks fast enough.
[01:19:14.200 --> 01:19:15.200]   Do it the twin.
[01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:16.200]   All right.
[01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:17.200]   Do it the twin, baby.
[01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:18.200]   Do it the twin.
[01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:19.200]   All right.
[01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:20.200]   Do it the twin.
[01:19:20.200 --> 01:19:21.200]   All right.
[01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:22.200]   Do it the twin.
[01:19:22.200 --> 01:19:23.200]   All right.
[01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:24.200]   Do it the twin, baby.
[01:19:24.200 --> 01:19:25.200]   Do it the twin.
[01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:26.200]   Do it the twin.
[01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:27.200]   All right.
[01:19:27.200 --> 01:19:28.200]   Do it the twin, baby.
[01:19:28.200 --> 01:19:29.200]   Do it the twin.
[01:19:29.200 --> 01:19:30.200]   All right.
[01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:31.200]   Do it the twin, baby.
[01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:32.200]   Do it the twin.
[01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:33.200]   All right.
[01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:34.200]   Do it the twin, baby.
[01:19:34.200 --> 01:19:35.200]   Do it the twin.
[01:19:35.200 --> 01:19:36.200]   All right.
[01:19:36.200 --> 01:19:37.200]   Do it the twin.
[01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:38.200]   All right.
[01:19:38.200 --> 01:19:39.200]   Do it the twin, baby.
[01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:40.200]   Do it the twin.
[01:19:40.200 --> 01:19:41.200]   All right.
[01:19:41.200 --> 01:19:42.200]   Do it the twin, baby.
[01:19:42.200 --> 01:19:43.200]   Do it the twin, baby.
[01:19:43.200 --> 01:19:44.200]   Do it the twin.
[01:19:44.200 --> 01:19:45.200]   All right.
[01:19:45.200 --> 01:19:46.200]   Do it the twin, baby.
[01:19:46.200 --> 01:19:47.200]   Do it the twin.
[01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:48.200]   All right.
[01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:49.200]   Do it the twin, baby.
[01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:50.200]   Do it the twin, baby.
[01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:51.200]   Do it the twin.
[01:19:51.200 --> 01:19:52.200]   All right.
[01:19:52.200 --> 01:19:53.200]   Do it the twin, baby.
[01:19:53.200 --> 01:19:54.200]   Do it the twin, baby.
[01:19:54.200 --> 01:19:56.780]   (bright music)
