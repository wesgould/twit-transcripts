[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Bandwidth for this weekend tech is provided by AOL Radio at AOL.com/podcasting.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:26.800]   This is Twit, this weekend tech, episode 60, with July 2, 2006.
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:33.800]   So joining us for a special Independence Day edition, a last minute cast cobbled together
[00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:48.320]   from the drugs of my Skype contact list, ladies and gentlemen. Actually, it's a pretty
[00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:55.320]   good one. To my left, John C. Devorex/blog.org. Or something like that.
[00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.000]   That's a little dyslexic, but it won't work if you'd enter it in.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.440]   Type Devorex/blog into Google. And there you'll get it. Also from the Slam Dance Industries,
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:11.440]   ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Patrick Norton, don't call him Pat. Don't call me drag either.
[00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:18.440]   He's no drag. And David Prager, who is also, I guess everybody else is on vacation for
[00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:25.080]   the Fourth of July, but hey, this is a quorum. This counts as a panel of Twits. David's
[00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:32.080]   working hard on Revision 3's podcast and podcasts system. Do you work on Dig Nation as well?
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.800]   I guess that's really part of your job too, isn't it?
[00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:41.040]   All of them. There's some changes going on, which I've probably said before, but everyone's
[00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.480]   been focusing on Dig 3.0 for the longest time. So now that it's out of the chutes, we're
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:51.480]   going to shift focus over a little bit more. We're going to update the website and start
[00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.800]   putting forth some more consistent different kinds of content.
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:01.160]   John was playing for us and you might want to play a little bit of this Ted Stevens,
[00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:07.360]   who is from Alaska, although I was confused earlier. He's on the tele... Is he the chairman
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.680]   of the telecommunications committee? Indeed.
[00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:17.680]   And the guy who is spearheading the new telecommunications bill this week, the Senate
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.940]   was going to be a little bit more
[00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.940]   than the other one.
[00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.940]   Well, actually, they didn't vote to eliminate the net neutrality provisions. They just didn't
[00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.940]   vote to include it. It was a tie vote.
[00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.740]   Yeah, 11/11.
[00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:38.140]   The committee couldn't agree, so it needs to be a majority to put it in. So the net neutrality
[00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:44.140]   provision is gone. And we have, I think, this fascinating explanation of net neutrality
[00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:50.640]   to provide streaming stuff going on the internet.
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:57.600]   Now the internet, let's go back. Internet started with a concept of local to local connections
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:04.520]   across the country. And you could go for air Alaska, but you had to go through local connections
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:11.560]   to get their industry wisely provided for streaming. In fact, a new kind of long distance.
[00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:17.200]   And that's what we've got. We've got a service that's immune to distance. And it's there
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:29.000]   for the consumer. But when we take and really indicate that anyone that wants to use this
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:37.880]   system for massive, massive commercial purposes, there's one company now. You can sign up and
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:44.800]   you've got a movie delivered to your house daily by my subscription service, my delivery
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:50.200]   service. Okay. And currently it comes to your house, put in a mailbox where you get
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:57.200]   home and enter your monthly, you change your order. But you pay for that, right? This service
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.680]   is now going to go through the internet. And what you do is you just go to a place on
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:08.000]   the internet and you order your movie. And guess what? You can order 10 of them and the
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:15.400]   delivery charge is free, right? 10 movies streaming across that internet. And what happens to
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.440]   your own personal internet? I just the other day got internet was sent by my staff at 10
[00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.760]   o'clock in the morning and Friday. I got it yesterday. Why? Because you got tangled
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.000]   up with all these things that are going on the internet commercially. And here we have
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.560]   this one situation where enormous entities want to use the internet for their purpose
[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:41.880]   to save money for doing what they're doing now. They use FedEx, they use the delivery services.
[00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:48.440]   They use the mail. They deliver in other ways, but they want to deliver vast amounts of information
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:53.560]   over the internet. And again, the internet is not something that you just dump something
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:59.360]   on. It's not a big truck. It's a series of tubes. And if you don't understand those
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.960]   tubes can be filled. And if they're filled, when you put your message in, it gets in line,
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.720]   it's going to be delayed by anyone that puts in that tube and enormous amounts of material.
[00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:13.800]   It reminds me of that old April Fool's guy, I did some years ago where I said these guys
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:19.600]   were trying to pass a law saying you can't be drunk when you're using a modem.
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:23.360]   Drunk driving and on the information superhighway. You know, I could actually see these guys
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:29.600]   doing it. And now look, Stevens is one of the three oldest senators. He obviously didn't
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:33.080]   grow up with the internet. He didn't even grow old with the internet. I mean, the internet
[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:38.920]   is a- He doesn't use the internet. He doesn't even use it. So it is. Oh, that's right. He's
[00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:44.640]   the guy who was trying to sneak the broadcast flag into the reality bill. Exactly. He's
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:52.000]   a weenie. Exactly. On Wednesday, let's see, the broadcast flag did make it through committee.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.520]   So net neutrality did not get through, but the broadcast flag did get through. Oh, what
[00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:03.960]   a wonderful day. Well, it's because the broadcast flag is incredibly well-funded.
[00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:09.280]   Yeah. Neutrality apparently isn't. I have to say, I shouldn't say this, but I'm still
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:14.440]   kind of conflicted over net neutrality. I don't like to see any government regulation
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:18.320]   the internet will wear the other. This is government regulation that says there's no
[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:21.520]   regulation. Is it necessary? It's something we have to do.
[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.800]   I think it happened in our country. It is. I don't think it is in any other country in
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.720]   the world, even China, although they're going to be doing their own thing.
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:33.440]   Ironically, it is necessary or they need something like that in Canada. Canadian cable
[00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:39.720]   companies are notorious for blocking competing services like VoiceOver Internet. Right. Well,
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:44.640]   that's going to happen here if we're not careful. So this really is not a regulation of the
[00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:48.400]   internet. It's a law to protect the internet and it is something we need.
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:52.400]   Well, you know, the funny thing about it is though, if it doesn't pass, it doesn't mean
[00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:57.360]   anything because it can pass again. It's not like a law, an onerous law is being passed.
[00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:00.320]   So it's not like a negative thing like this flag deal.
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:05.680]   Right. So they can take another shot at it or two. So I think it'll eventually go through it.
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:10.960]   Or either that, it may just go away if these, the guys that run the cable companies and
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:15.760]   the phone companies stop, maybe shut up for a few minutes and quit threatening everybody with,
[00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:21.600]   well, you know, Google shouldn't have a free ride. I like to see what Google doesn't have a
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:25.200]   free ride. I know they don't. That's a point. That's what they're in. But that's what's amazing.
[00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:28.160]   Can you imagine how much Google is paying?
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:33.200]   Enormous amounts. And that's what's so pathetic about this is because of, you know,
[00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:38.640]   a fuel well placed lobbyists and one idiot at AT&T in his cronies have been out there going,
[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:44.960]   there's a free ride. We built those pipes to the household and it's like, hey, jerk,
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:50.720]   you know, when did you get to wire copper to every house in North America when you were
[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:54.720]   protecting corporate monopoly? You know, and guess what? You want free market? Great.
[00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:57.600]   But it's like, if they're looking, the idea that they're looking at, you know,
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:01.280]   we want to be able to, you know, it's, we want to be able to create, and this is the
[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:06.480]   interesting. We want to create a preferred carriage that will only be accessible if it's paid for by,
[00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:11.120]   you know, the server at the other end. And it's a complete line of dogs not.
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:16.080]   You know, what's interesting about it, I mean, they already have tiered service in terms of the
[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:20.560]   speed you buy. And, you know, we've already tolerated that. I mean, they're, yeah, I don't know what
[00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:25.360]   more these guys want. The fact of the matter is they can, you know, do whatever they want with,
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:28.880]   yeah, they don't want to have to deliver the speeds they claim they're delivering you.
[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:32.480]   Yeah, that's another thing. They should be, that should be a guaranteed speed. This is a,
[00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:37.200]   this is a, I think this is, these guys should be arrested. There's, I mean, this is fraud. They
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:42.080]   claim to be, both the, all these guys give these claims of speed. And then if you go, you check it
[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:46.960]   on any service that checks speeds and you're not getting those speeds. Why is that even,
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:51.120]   why does it the district attorney go after these people? This is a consumer affairs department
[00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:54.880]   kind of thing. I mean, there's a, there's a scam going on here. It seems to me.
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:58.640]   I don't know. It's, it's looking at the other thing I find out I've been noticing is,
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:02.400]   is it's really interesting to watch the level of packet shaping that goes on,
[00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:09.520]   in different, uh, packet shaping in the sense of, of, of limiting or, or throttling your speed,
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:11.920]   depending on the traffic and where it's coming from and where it's going to.
[00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:15.680]   That, well, that's, and they do that with BitTorrent particularly because they don't like, uh,
[00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:19.040]   all that. They do it with BitTorrent traffic. We actually run and do it a lot with, uh,
[00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:24.800]   streaming video and with video downloads. Um, we run into it a lot. It's, you know,
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:27.760]   when they talk about it, though, when they're not talking, when they're not complaining about
[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:32.720]   Google, when, what they talk about is the positive. They're saying, well, we can do, if,
[00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:36.320]   for a little more money, you can get better quality of service for your voice.
[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:39.680]   But that's just it. You're not. You see the whole thing, the whole thing that the whole argument,
[00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:45.040]   right? Part of the original argument behind this came from sort of an engineering economist at
[00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:51.360]   AT&D was like, you know, uh, you know, people want this, the equivalent of managed people want
[00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:55.600]   the equivalent of a managed circuit, right? They want people, the fundamental argument is,
[00:09:55.600 --> 00:10:01.120]   if people actually want the bandwidth that they think they're paying for, it's going to cost us
[00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:06.720]   $400, you know, for a five megabit line instead of the $50 we're charging them monthly, right?
[00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:11.120]   And, and then it's completely unsustainable. And the flip side is a lot of the engineers,
[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:15.760]   you know, and you can get into the whole argument versus, you know, college engineers versus,
[00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:20.960]   you know, university professors versus people out in the real quote, real world. Um, you know,
[00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:26.080]   is that a lot of people are saying the easiest way to deliver bandwidth on the cheap is to just
[00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:32.160]   step everything up to, you know, internet to throughput speeds. But, you know, part of what
[00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:36.480]   18 engineer, 18 T engineers said, look, everybody wants that video. You know, our network wasn't
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:39.920]   designed to do that. It was designed for first transmissions here and there. And yeah, you know,
[00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:44.720]   we can give you like this speed, but we can't sustain it 24 seven for every user that's impossible.
[00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:49.360]   And if you want that, you got to step up to a managed line that costs, you know, a couple,
[00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:54.160]   you know, 100, 400. Is that the case? I mean, doesn't, what's it? Don't we get, I mean,
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:59.600]   sustain throughput high sustained throughputs over, you know, these files and other high,
[00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:04.560]   well, I think files might be doing it. But do you think the average DSL customer can download it,
[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:09.520]   you know, their maximum speed 24 seven? Yeah, I don't certainly not ever, but not if everybody
[00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:13.840]   did it at once. So in that case, they certainly have an argument. They're saying, well, look,
[00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:17.600]   every, you know, people are using it harder than they were before. We could, we could give you
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:21.440]   that number when it was, how does that mean? How does that, but how does that cost more,
[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:24.960]   right? Because at the, at the top level, the interchanges between backbones are
[00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:29.360]   paired, which means it's free exchange of packets. And at the lower level, I mean,
[00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:33.120]   are we talking about saturating routers so that they have to build additional equipment into the
[00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:37.440]   colo? I mean, what does it cost more if they're not paying for their access? You're saying they're
[00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:43.200]   not paying for their access? Well, if, if, if like 18 t, for example, 18 t is, is not just an ISP,
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:46.720]   but they're also a backbone, right? They control some of the fundamental lines on the internet.
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:51.040]   So where are they getting charged for this bandwidth that, that's supposedly is breaking them?
[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:54.720]   I mean, there, maybe they're charging themselves internally, but I think it's not unreasonable for
[00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:59.040]   them to say it's costing them something. Well, it's costing them something, but, but where is it
[00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:02.640]   costing them? You know what I mean? It's like, I understand if they, you know, if they basically,
[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:06.160]   if they've wired every neighborhood in North America with the equivalent of, you know, 10
[00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:10.960]   megabit per second ethernet or 100, you know, megabit per second ethernet. And I'm generalizing
[00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:16.240]   here before I get angry letters from network engineers. But, you know, and, and if the whole
[00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:20.640]   country wants to have, you know, you know, 10 times, you know, digabit ethernet, then they have to
[00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:26.080]   upgrade equipment. But, you know, there is a certain amount of merit to the argument. I mean,
[00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:32.720]   look at, we're, we're kind of whiny, frankly, we consumers, we want everything cheap and free and,
[00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:38.560]   no, I don't, I didn't go with a 25, you know, $22. But most people do, but most people do. And,
[00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:43.360]   and, and most people are saying, I don't want to pay it all. And why am I having to pay so much?
[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:47.760]   And, and I've said that myself, I've said that we pay more in the States than we do in most other
[00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:51.840]   countries. Is it unreasonable for them as a business to say, well, look, you want better
[00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:55.760]   service? You want you guys all want to watch YouTube 24 hours a day? You're going to have to pay us.
[00:12:55.760 --> 00:13:00.880]   Well, if they actually do, you know, they're not delivering me the bandwidth a lot of the time
[00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:04.480]   that they currently claim they are, because I get the bandwidth. If I go to, like, you know,
[00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:09.680]   you know, bandwidth detector dot test dot, whatever it is. But if I'm actually real world on an
[00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:12.880]   application where I've no off with the bandwidth on the other end, then I can tell it's throttle.
[00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:17.920]   I'm in agreement with Patrick and, and, and the fact is, you know, these guys, these guys are
[00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:22.400]   selling something there. It's not like they're, you know, it's just almost bait and switch.
[00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:28.240]   I mean, they say they're giving you a, you know, 1.5 megabits per second or door,
[00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:33.360]   door six or whatever they're particularly thing. And within that range of the,
[00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:37.360]   if I'm getting six, where is it? Well, don't they say, I mean, then the wine about, oh, you,
[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:41.920]   you didn't expect you to use it. Don't they say we're going to two six. Do they actually say,
[00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:46.080]   always six? No, they say up to six megabits. Yeah. What does that mean? I'm supposed to be getting
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:52.960]   seven 50. So that means up to six means maybe, when I get six once a year, hey, on Tuesday and
[00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:57.920]   November 6th, they gave me a six for one millisecond. Well, I mean, what kind of a scam is this?
[00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:01.520]   I don't know why you're supporting these. No, I'm playing devil's advocate. But I think it's
[00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:05.200]   important that they, that this argument be made because I'd like to hear the argument against
[00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:11.120]   it. You're not convincing me. I mean, if, if they built a network that was based on a certain amount
[00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:16.400]   of usage that wasn't sustained six megabits, but peaking at six megabits, and all of a sudden,
[00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:19.840]   everybody's looking for a sustained six megabits. The network doesn't support it.
[00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:24.320]   I don't think everybody's not looking. Most people are surfing the internet once in a while.
[00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:28.880]   But most people, who's getting the six? That's what I'd like to know. Where is that guy?
[00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:34.400]   I get, I get four or five regularly on my cable modem. And I'm, you know, they build as up to six
[00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:38.080]   peaks at six, but I get, I mean, I'm not unhappy with it. Have you ever gotten six?
[00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:42.160]   You ever gotten six is up to six? I know. That's a good question. I doubt it.
[00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:45.920]   Well, I don't think anybody would know unless you were constantly monitoring.
[00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:52.000]   Well, and a lot of people are, you know, I think if, if any of the numbers I've heard are real,
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.160]   right, and not just the fabrication of somebody who's trying to crush, you know,
[00:14:56.160 --> 00:15:00.080]   bit torrent, you know, if they're claiming like some huge percentage of all traffic on the net
[00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:04.960]   right now, it's peer to peer file sharing, you know, that's an interesting thing, right? I mean,
[00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:10.880]   that's an interesting proposition, you know, it would be, it would be, you know, it's,
[00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:15.760]   because I run into people who have some pretty, a lot of Fios customers and certainly people
[00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:20.560]   at certain universities who aren't out on like the dormitory networks, but are working in the
[00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:25.520]   labs and stuff, you know, they can download like DLTV at two megabits per second.
[00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:30.640]   Well, if it's possible to economically offer really high speed in, in other words,
[00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:35.680]   if these guys are greedy and just claiming it's harder than it is, why doesn't some
[00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:39.360]   white knight come along and say, okay, well, you know, the truth is I can do it for buck 50.
[00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:44.240]   Well, remember something, right? If you're the white knight, like right now, you know, I went
[00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:48.640]   with a cable modem and said a DSL when I moved into my new house because I no longer need a landline,
[00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:52.720]   right? Right. So if you need a white knight and need a landline, so, you know, who's,
[00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:56.880]   who's my white knight for DSL and do I want to put in a landline to do that? So what's my other
[00:15:56.880 --> 00:16:01.840]   option? Comcast cable? Right. Well, it works clearly. Competition is the key here. And in fact,
[00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:06.800]   if if anything, maybe we should be encouraging Congress to encourage competition
[00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:12.160]   and encourage alternate sources of internet. And if there is cop true competition, then wouldn't,
[00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:17.520]   I don't know, wouldn't all of this go away? Interesting thought. These are a couple of
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:21.440]   monopolists that know how to play the game better than we can argue. They are playing it very well.
[00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:26.320]   Anyway, I, you know, I, I, I agree. And I am absolutely in principle in favor of
[00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:31.840]   net neutrality. I was disappointed that the Congress that the committee didn't add that to the bill.
[00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:35.520]   But at the same time, I think there are some legitimate arguments saying, well, you know,
[00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:40.960]   do we want to do we want to legislate this? And I think you've argued well in favor. So all right,
[00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:45.280]   I'm supporting it. The other thing is part of the whole reason this came up is because the,
[00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:52.240]   the baby bells want, you know, the blessing and love of the government to do what amounts to
[00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:57.040]   cable TV over the networks. No, I think that's a fair trade. If they want to be, you know,
[00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:01.440]   if they want to crush the cable TV networks or get into a running battle with them, the very least,
[00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:05.600]   the federal government can do in exchange is, is make sure that they're not going to
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:11.440]   crush the ability to download video from places other than, you know, insert name of my DSL providers,
[00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:18.480]   video project, you know, right, right. Because that's where that's where it gets interesting.
[00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:22.240]   You know, like Craig Newmark's argument is the whole like, if I call for Joe's pizza,
[00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:27.520]   you know, I want to get, you know, I want to directly dial up Joe's pizza. I don't want,
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:33.520]   you know, to dial Joe's pizza and have, you know, AT&T send me to, you know, Jimmy Joe Bob's pizza
[00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:39.680]   in barbecue because Jimmy Joe Bob's pizza in barbecue is a subset of AT&T, you know. And then
[00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:44.000]   eventually if I choose not to do that, then they'll let me, you know, talk to Joe's pizza at every
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.120]   school. Well, I hear these arguments now, see, this again, this bugs me a little bit big. I hear
[00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:51.200]   these arguments, but these are completely fabricated. Nobody's suggesting that the, I mean, I don't
[00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:56.080]   think AT&T is going to suddenly substitute your search at Google with MSN search, just because MSN
[00:17:56.080 --> 00:18:01.040]   gave them money. And if they did, I think then howl is a protest, absolutely. But, I mean,
[00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:04.880]   that's hypothetical. I don't think anybody's saying that. Okay, well, okay, if I want to download
[00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:13.200]   video, right? And my ISP throttles any video that doesn't happen to be part of their flash,
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:18.000]   you know, video on demand service, you know, that's, that's right there. That's effectively
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.480]   doing it. Will they move that direction in the future? I'm sure they'd like to. I mean,
[00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:26.480]   what is, are they going to throttle or are they going to leave it the same and give you better bandwidth
[00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:31.360]   for their service? Yeah, well, the problem is that they're already throttling now, right? A lot of cases.
[00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:35.360]   This is whether or not they're throttling or not throttling or whether or not it's
[00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:42.400]   hypothetical or not hypothetical, as Leo suggests, the fact of the matter is they've been hinting at
[00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:47.440]   it. They've been hinting at this is what they're going to do. And that's the reason that they hadn't
[00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:52.240]   been if they hadn't been right on the case. Shut up. Right. Right. Let me add Bill McCrone, who is
[00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:57.840]   calling in. Bill, are you there? Yes, I am. Hey, that's great. And of course,
[00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:02.880]   Bill would have good quality headset microphone and sound great. I would expect that. No less.
[00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:08.800]   We were just talking about net neutrality. And, you know, I didn't know if you have any thoughts on
[00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:16.320]   that, but essentially, before we do, I should, I should probably introduce Bill because we have
[00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:25.440]   a long history. Bill McCrone was at PC Magazine editor. He was the guy who started Ziff Davis's
[00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:33.840]   entry into television. And I first met him when I auditioned for him in 1994 for the show that they
[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:40.240]   were going to do on CNBC called MSNBC. Well, no, no, this predates that. There was no.
[00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:46.240]   Really? We do. I said, okay. This goes back to when we shot, Gina and I did the show with Jim
[00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:53.280]   Lauterbeck at the old Apple TV studios. That's right. And it was we had a couple of different names.
[00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:58.480]   In fact, at one point, it was called tech TV, ironically. That's right. And what are you doing?
[00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:01.680]   What are you doing these days? Are you still writing for PC Magazine at all?
[00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:06.480]   I'm still a columnist. I guess that makes me the longest running columnist, maybe in the industry,
[00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:16.160]   at this point, in one publication. It doesn't, Jerry, Renelle have the right stir. Well, Jerry's
[00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:20.320]   writing for bite, but bite's not really a magazine anymore. So I don't know if that counts.
[00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:25.760]   Yeah. Well, it's, it's a little hassle. I'm hoping you, I was hoping he's going to quit so I could
[00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:32.000]   take it. Oh, take the range. I have to be there another few years. Hey, I had dinner with Stuart
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:37.440]   Alsop last night. So he's gunning for you. Look out, John. Wow. He's still around.
[00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:42.400]   So Bill is really the geek ski can always has been. He was the guy who, who really formed
[00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:48.000]   PC Magazine and led it for many years. And I'm really glad we could get you on. My pleasure.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.520]   Join the conversation. We're talking about net neutrality and I'm afraid I've been cast in the
[00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:58.720]   role of devil's advocate on my own decision. And what we're really talking about, my question is,
[00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:03.600]   is there, is this really something we should be worried about? Yeah, sure. AT&T and Verizon have
[00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:08.160]   started rattling the cage about all Google stealing our bandwidth. And that's something to be
[00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:14.240]   concerned about. But do we really need to make a law or won't, won't just natural competition
[00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:20.960]   protect us from this? Well, I don't think our politicians will protect us.
[00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:28.400]   We know that much. They've already decided not to. Yeah. And I have a link somewhere here to
[00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:33.680]   an MP3 of Ted Stevens in vain. We were just listening to that.
[00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:41.120]   Okay. Yeah. Well, tell us your effect. I'm going to, I'll add this a little bit. So you heard
[00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:46.320]   Ted Stevens, a kind of disjointed conversation about net neutrality or speech
[00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:52.240]   about net neutrality. What's your take on it? I'd say that if anybody ever wants to know what the
[00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:57.520]   working definition of double speak is, they should just listen to Ted. Do you think he's in the pockets
[00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:09.760]   of the big telcos? I could not say, but he is not exactly been Mr. Squeaky Clean, has he? No.
[00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:16.480]   Yeah. We have a policy of describing him on the Dvorak blog as an a-hole.
[00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:25.600]   Ever just something to do with Alaska? Yes, exactly. That's it. That's a ticket. He's from Alaska.
[00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:35.120]   So, I mean, I don't, I don't, I guess I volunteered myself for this devil's advocate. I just, I really
[00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:40.320]   think that what's happened is there's been this polarization between those who, you know, say,
[00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:44.320]   net neutrality is a, you know, must, we've got to have it and those who say, oh, that's ridiculous.
[00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:48.160]   And I don't think people are listening to the other side's arguments particularly,
[00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:51.280]   or even defeating the other side's arguments. So I thought it'd be important to kind of bring
[00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:55.040]   up the story. Well, does that, does that, you know, you're kind of suggesting that the other side
[00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:57.760]   has a valid argument. If you, if you have a, if you have a, if you have a, if you have a,
[00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:02.240]   argument, since you're playing devil's elegant, what is that valid argument? Well,
[00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:06.320]   exactly what I just said, which is they built their networks for a certain amount of usage.
[00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:11.040]   They didn't plan on people using it as thoroughly and heavily as they are. They didn't plan for
[00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:16.640]   sustained five megabit downloads from, you know, a quarter of their customers. And they were quite
[00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:22.000]   rightly say that if we, if you want that kind of service, we're going to have to prioritize traffic.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:29.920]   And so if they're, if the, if this is legitimate, argue Leo and, and they are so beholden to the
[00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:35.600]   consumers that keep them paid, right? Us, we, the, the, why are they, why are they not turning to
[00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:40.800]   us and saying, if you want guaranteed bandwidth, you, Patrick Norton, will have to pay X number of
[00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:46.640]   dollars more per month, and we will deliver that bandwidth to you, instead of going into Congress
[00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:53.120]   with lobbyists and say, Google is ripping us off. They ain't paying for bandwidth when they come to
[00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:57.680]   our customers, right? Tell me that, Leo. I'll tell you why. I'll tell you exactly why. I'll tell you
[00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:01.600]   exactly why. So the issue is they feel like customers are not going to pay any more money.
[00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:06.960]   They're very price sensitive as it is. And they feel it's only reasonable if, if providers, like
[00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:13.680]   YouTube, like Google want, you know, better access to their customers. And this is where I think that
[00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:18.320]   the monopolies of the cable companies and the phone companies have a worldview that is a little
[00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:24.160]   distorted. They view us as their custom, you know, their customers that they offer access to other
[00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:29.600]   people, you know, like Google and YouTube, they offer us to them. And that's why they want to go
[00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:33.600]   to them and say, look, if you want access to them, if you want bet, and by the way, let's not say
[00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:38.560]   just access, they already have access. If you want better access, we'll be glad to give it to you,
[00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:46.960]   but somebody's got to be a lot if you want Gary, so twisted. Why? This internet would be
[00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:51.920]   nothing without what we've done here at AT&T to connect up our consumers to the internet. I mean,
[00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:57.440]   is that exactly the argument? I mean, what you're talking about the eight companies that are the
[00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:04.240]   top tier in terms of providing the high-speed backbone, and you know, they're saying they're
[00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:13.040]   not making money on their backbone. Well, raise your price per gigabyte, you know, nobody's stopping
[00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:20.960]   them. But I see arguments from these guys that make it sound like it's universal access, that
[00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:29.600]   somehow the internet subsidizes individuals the way the phone companies do. And I think I heard
[00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:37.840]   Stephen say that until one of his underlings corrected him. So there's a lot of general
[00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:44.880]   purpose misunderstanding out there. It may be a worldview issue. I mean, I think that there
[00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:50.720]   definitely is a worldview that the big providers have that somewhat disjointed from what
[00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:56.800]   the actual facts are. We're not their customers. The metropolitan area networks are their customers,
[00:25:56.800 --> 00:26:01.280]   and the ISPs are their customers, and there are about three tiers, four tiers away from us.
[00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:08.560]   Right. Right. I mean, just have to do, you know, look at the number of hops and where your
[00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:14.640]   signal goes to get from here to there, and they're up at the top of the chain, and nothing to do with
[00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:22.720]   us. They're just greedy sons of guns. Well, yeah, sons of guns. I'm not going to call them greedy.
[00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:27.680]   I'm going to call them stupid because they don't know how to price their their own products. You
[00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:31.440]   know, you know, I think there's something to that. And the fact of the matter is I don't think these
[00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:35.040]   guys really get what they're into and what they're doing. And I think that the fact that you're
[00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:36.400]   saying, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
[00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:41.600]   here, no, there's stupidity is what we're talking about. And I tell you the reason why I totally
[00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:44.560]   convince that Bill's writing this because their representative is Ted Stevens.
[00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:51.760]   Come on. This is the guy that I asked you, Bill, I mean, come on, the problem is that they're not
[00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:58.800]   charging us enough. Now they're not charging enough for access period. They charge by the
[00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:04.480]   gigabyte, terabyte, monster, byte, whatever, backbone, the real. All right. But it'd be passed
[00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:09.760]   along to us. I mean, if they charge the orchids passed along to Google and Yahoo's profits,
[00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:15.040]   looking for, you know what, there's something that's what I think maybe we're getting at here.
[00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:21.760]   There's some scam going on because if all this was just about, you know, access and just put
[00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:25.920]   their yeah, just up the end and then do it on the backbone side and everybody just has to pay more.
[00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:30.480]   There's something else they're trying to nickel and dime us to death with some scam.
[00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:35.760]   Well, that's what's going on. Let me propose a scam. Maybe the scam is an anti-competitive scam.
[00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:41.360]   They're worried about voice over the internet. They're worried about YouTube and Google providing
[00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:52.160]   television and Apple providing television shows. I'm sorry. They've been talking about this,
[00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:59.600]   you know, voice over video diotone for the last 25 years that I recall and they've never been
[00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:03.200]   able to deliver it. And I think it's possible they're looking or left and right and seeing all
[00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:07.200]   the stuff going on. They're saying, "Oh my God, you know, what do we do to slow this down? We can't
[00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:11.520]   keep up. We're too stupid." Well, I'll tell you one thing I do know for a fact is that they don't
[00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:17.680]   like the business model of merely making money on bits. They, both the cable companies and I think
[00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:22.400]   to some extent, the telcos see themselves as making their money on premium services, selling
[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:26.720]   premium services on top of those bits. They don't want to be a data provider.
[00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:32.400]   Well, I mean, certainly the cell phone networks, realizing it's much easier to, I mean, because they
[00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:37.520]   make money that way. They spend so much money subsidizing cell phones and, you know, it's, yeah, it's
[00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:42.640]   easy to use your skin profits out of. I think we've made our point. Why don't we go to another topic?
[00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:50.000]   All right. Topic number two, Microsoft delays Office 2007 till sometime in 2007 saying,
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:29:00.480]   it's not ready yet. Will it ever be ready? I've been playing with it. And of course, VISTA Beta
[00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:05.600]   2, and they both seem fairly ready. I'm not sure exactly what the issue is, but why is it
[00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:07.920]   Microsoft's having such trouble getting these products at the door?
[00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:17.840]   Well, they're phenomenally complex for one thing. I mean, as if 2003 and XP weren't complex enough,
[00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:25.760]   they're layering even more stuff on there. And of course, they're building all of this phone home
[00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:34.240]   stuff into their software. And which is not getting a great reception out there. So they're having
[00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:38.640]   to re-engineer some portions of that to make it a little more socially acceptable.
[00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:42.720]   You're talking about the Windows Genuine Advantage type stuff or something?
[00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:47.920]   Exactly. Yeah. Exactly. Well, who knows what else is in there, but certainly Genuine Advantage
[00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:55.440]   is a silly thing. To Microsoft's credit, they're doing 2 million. They've shipped out 2 million
[00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:58.880]   betas of VISTA 2. They just closed it down, by the way, on Friday.
[00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:03.280]   That's it. If you didn't get it, in fact, they say if you haven't activated your beta,
[00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:06.800]   activate because we don't guarantee you'll be able to activate much longer.
[00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:11.120]   Bill, for people that don't know, can you explain Windows Genuine Advantage?
[00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:18.640]   No, I can't. I'll try. It's an anti-piracy technology when you
[00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:21.280]   Microsoft introduced this shortly after service passes.
[00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:22.800]   How does an advantage?
[00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:26.880]   Yeah, well, that's a good question. Well, that's just clever marketing. It's like Patriot Act.
[00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:33.200]   Who's advantage Microsoft? But I can't blame them for trying to protect themselves against piracy.
[00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:37.520]   Except that it slows down all of the people who aren't pirates.
[00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:39.840]   It's a classic case. Yeah.
[00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:45.600]   Not only that, it seems to be broken substantially. I talked to a lot of people who have legitimate
[00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:48.320]   copies of Windows who are told they don't have legitimate copies.
[00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:52.640]   And then there's the greater issue of the fact that it was actually phoning home daily.
[00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:55.280]   Yes. Microsoft says they're going to stop doing.
[00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:58.640]   Yes. I can't imagine what it's asking about.
[00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:03.040]   Is it OK to run? Can I run now? Is it OK now?
[00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:07.680]   We've seen some really egregious stuff on the part of manufacturers.
[00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:16.160]   I monitor all new software that I install. My wife got an HP computer
[00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:26.000]   a while ago. It's subsequently been replaced. But it suddenly lit up my packet detector.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:34.480]   And I was wondering what it was doing and traced it back to the keyboard driver.
[00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:40.800]   And it was calling some server deep in the bowels of a packard.
[00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:48.480]   So I of course locked it out and then called the PR people at HP.
[00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:51.840]   And they were completely baffled and embarrassed about the whole thing.
[00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:57.200]   And they went down the chain of command and found some engineer deep in the bowels of the
[00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:03.360]   organization who said, "Oh yeah, I wrote that driver and I put a little call home feature in
[00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:08.160]   there because I wanted to see what programmable function keys people were using."
[00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:15.440]   Oh my goodness. So you do nothing like doing a little market research on the back of your customers.
[00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:19.360]   Oh my goodness. I'm pretty thoroughly impressed that you were able to get to the bottom of that.
[00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:28.320]   That is impressive. Yeah. This amazed myself. But you know, there's all kinds of stuff like that
[00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:31.680]   going on in the world. And you never know until you.
[00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:36.800]   But doesn't that also mean that you could have some guy who writes drivers in the back of any
[00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:42.000]   big company like HP writing all kinds of queries back to the home office for who knows what?
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:47.280]   Sounds like a bad backdoor to me. Yeah. And you have no control over it.
[00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:50.800]   Well, that's the thing you'd wonder about HP's QC that they didn't notice that themselves.
[00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:57.440]   Well, the QC guys probably didn't never thought about it. Yeah. It's like, "Oh yeah, it's logging in."
[00:32:57.440 --> 00:33:00.800]   Or else you, you know, they grouped it all up and down the line.
[00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:04.720]   Now let's get realistic about QC nowadays when it comes to computers. These things are rolling
[00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:10.400]   off a line in northern China by the millions. And the QC is like some, you know, a bunch of people
[00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:14.880]   with rubber mallets pound in the side of the machine if it doesn't blow up and get shipped.
[00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:22.240]   Come on. Sometimes I think you're right. I've seen these factories. I am right, believe me.
[00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:28.320]   So speaking of pounding things with the rubber mallets, they don't have to worry about
[00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:31.920]   pounding anything on the space shuttle. They just got to worry about launching it somewhere
[00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:34.800]   instead of Florida. They just, it's all weather, isn't it?
[00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:39.120]   Yeah, but I just, I mean, I know it's a big issue to do something, but
[00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:43.280]   I just don't understand why they keep launching out of Cape Canaveral. I mean,
[00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:47.360]   they should launch from the middle of Death Valley because it's a blue sky every day.
[00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:53.600]   Band of Virginis. Well, as long as it's far enough south, but you know, the whole thing is about
[00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:58.560]   recovering the boosters. The SRBs, yeah. Yeah, they fall in the ocean.
[00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:04.960]   Of course, the Russians never had that problem. No, they usually land in cities.
[00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:09.600]   The Russians at the USSR at the time had a slightly different sort of, you know,
[00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:14.560]   impact. You know, I mean, they're a little less worried about the impact on communities
[00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:19.920]   and or the environment. Not that blowing off rockets doesn't spew a lot of insane stuff in the
[00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:24.480]   heat. The same way as China packs up and moves people out of when they built that three-gorgers
[00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:26.320]   dam. They're like, we're going to flood your town. Get out.
[00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:32.240]   That's eminent domain. That's a lot. Anybody jump into a new story?
[00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:36.480]   Has anyone noticed a story about Alaska selling, trying to sell a school on eBay?
[00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:41.600]   No, what's the sell of us? So the eBay, is that the tech angle?
[00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:45.280]   Is that Ted SA hole?
[00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:53.760]   Is that where you send your PayPal? It's actually very expensive. It's at 1.8 million dollars
[00:34:54.560 --> 00:35:02.800]   for this a Lucian's Eastboro school. I don't know why you would. It's a 40. Oh, I see. It's 43,000
[00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:07.440]   square feet. That's a warehouse, which is the way most schools are built this nowadays,
[00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:12.560]   if anyone hasn't noticed. And it's on the waterfront block. They're going to turn it into a seafood
[00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:16.160]   processing plant. That's what they're going to do. That's why. Okay, Red Hatch is slapped with a
[00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:20.480]   patent suit. Are you just are you just dipping your finger in the story? I'm just going for it.
[00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:24.240]   You know, we spend so much time on that net neutrality thing that people must be listening
[00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:27.760]   to the show thinking that we're just not being. I'll cut it down. Don't worry.
[00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:32.240]   How do you always say that? I'll cut it down to the seminal five minutes. Don't worry.
[00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:36.160]   Bill, I'm sorry you had to be here for this bickering. Well, that's okay. It's very
[00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:45.200]   enjoyable. Red Hatch suit. All right. Anything? Yeah. File star has filed a claim against Red Hat
[00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:50.640]   for patent infringement. I don't even do these stories anymore because anybody can file a patent
[00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:55.520]   lawsuit and they often do. New attack, flaw in Apple computers. I'm not getting anything there.
[00:35:55.520 --> 00:36:00.160]   Well, it's actually interesting because this actually attacks a flaw that Apple so thought it
[00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:07.760]   patched. There was a fairly large patch that went out this week for OS 10 users and including
[00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:16.160]   a patch for a security hole in launch D. And apparently this this attacks found a continuing
[00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:24.400]   hole in it. You know, the problem with this is the story comes from Symantec who makes interestingly
[00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:31.040]   enough security software for OS 10. I'm always a little suspect when a company that makes security
[00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:35.760]   software tries to play up these vulnerabilities, especially since there has been no evidence of
[00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:40.640]   it in the wild at all. So all right, well, let's jump to this story. This one here.
[00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:45.600]   This one, this one fascinates me. Okay. By the way, Bill, we have a list of stories that we can
[00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:50.240]   say. Yeah, but you don't need it. Believe me, it's. Because we obviously these stories are so thin
[00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:53.040]   that you're not going to need to know anything. Well, I haven't I hadn't pruned them yet. And
[00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:57.680]   that's my fault for now. Okay, Western digital settles does anyone find this and we actually kind
[00:36:57.680 --> 00:37:02.320]   of a funny story because I've always thought it was slightly confusing the way they would present
[00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:06.240]   these, you know, what I got a 80 gigabyte drive and then you do the calculation at something else.
[00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:10.640]   Oh, you mean the whole one divisible by 1000, 24 type of thing?
[00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:13.680]   This is binary. There's actually somebody sued over that.
[00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:19.200]   Yeah, they got sued. Western digital got sued for calling. Well, let me read you from this story.
[00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:24.560]   They say it now very clearly in the ads on the packaging, one billion bytes equals one comma
[00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:28.480]   zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero. They always say that now
[00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:33.040]   because they, well, what's so good about they call their 80 gigabyte drive head. They got sued
[00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:39.760]   because it only had 79, you know, 0.9, seven, two, five, four, two, seven, two gigabytes, you know,
[00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:45.200]   seven, that's the only reason I'd ever want to be a judge is so I could get cases like that and
[00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:51.440]   throw them out. Yeah, just throw them into into jail just for bringing cases like that.
[00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:55.040]   But now there was there were there have been some legitimacy. Remember there was the lawsuit
[00:37:55.040 --> 00:38:00.800]   over a screen monitor measurements where they were including the black edges and the old CRTs.
[00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:05.760]   I mean, there have been cases where it's, you know, a little, well, yeah, woohoo, but
[00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:13.280]   we all knew what size TV we were getting and a 27 inch TV, you know, you could just buy them by
[00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:18.960]   the pound or the depth or anything because everything else was the same. Right. No, that's a very good
[00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:26.080]   point. Yeah. So yeah, but people just love to sue for, you know, incredibly stupid things. So.
[00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:31.840]   Speaking of suits, we were talking about WGA. There is a class action lawsuit against
[00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:37.280]   Microsoft for Windows genuine advantage. Let me see if I can find that story because that
[00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:42.160]   might be a lawsuit that you would you would back up. I don't know. Let's see. The
[00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:46.560]   You talking about the class action? Yeah, it was filed on Monday in Seattle.
[00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:52.240]   And the lawsuit alleges the program violates consumer protection laws in California and
[00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:57.840]   Washington state. That's it's spyware and invasive programs that surreptitiously collect data. I
[00:38:57.840 --> 00:39:03.440]   mean, nobody's denying that WDGA does. Yeah, the irony that Washington state has probably the most
[00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:07.600]   owner is laws in that regard that not let you do that. You can actually, you probably could start a
[00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:13.120]   business and make money by, you know, busting people for spyware in Washington state. Well,
[00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:17.440]   California less so interesting revelation though in this suit, for instance, Mike and Microsoft
[00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:24.000]   admits this. There was a high priority update. I think in April, you know, one of those critical
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:29.680]   updates turns out it was just a test version of the WDGA software that Mike was pushing out.
[00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:33.440]   Yeah, it sounds like those terror alerts they have just before the elections.
[00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:40.880]   Yeah, no kidding. But WGA is manufactured specifically to keep people from pirating their
[00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:45.600]   operating system. Everybody who runs XP now wants updates needs to be running it.
[00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:51.120]   And so like the whole the whole issue is if you're running a fake, a non-validated
[00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:54.960]   Windows, you don't need to be spreading viruses because you don't have the latest patch.
[00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:58.400]   Well, now, and this to the Microsoft credit, and I don't know how much longer they'll do this,
[00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:02.320]   they do still give you critical updates. So security updates are still available, even if you're
[00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:06.320]   running pirated versions of Windows, not if you're running my intimate windows of windows of windows
[00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:11.920]   98. But if you're not supporting windows 98, Windows, no more. Right, they did.
[00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:16.480]   Also, go ahead to the whole point of this was that they were just going to start
[00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:21.440]   blacking and like shutting down systems that weren't accepting windows changing to an advantage.
[00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:27.200]   Now I haven't heard that. Well, they did threaten to do that early on, and there was such a hue
[00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:33.280]   and cry that they immediately backed away from from that. And people would rather go back to the
[00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:38.160]   the days of Bill Gates stepping on little companies. Yeah.
[00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:45.920]   Microsoft did release a new version of WGA that allows you to at least turn off the notifications.
[00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:51.040]   It doesn't it also doesn't check out phone home quite as often. But the real problem, I think,
[00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:56.240]   is that it's again, I'll say this again, because it keeps happening is it does also flag legitimate
[00:40:56.240 --> 00:41:00.000]   software frequently. And then you got this notification, you still can get your updates,
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:05.280]   you can't download the next direct decks nine or, you know, copies of paint.net or whatever,
[00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:11.440]   but you can get the critical updates. Whatever it is there. You know, there is a paint done that.
[00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:14.960]   It's not from Microsoft. What is the name of that Microsoft paint program there was a
[00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:19.840]   MS paint? No, no, they actually have a pretty good little graphics program that they pushed out for
[00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:23.840]   free. But you had the ones from years ago, the one that they pulled, they don't have it anymore,
[00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:27.680]   that cool little thing that did all kinds of weird stuff, and they just disappeared.
[00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:31.120]   I don't think it's that old. I think it was recently. Oh, well, there was one I remember.
[00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:35.520]   They've been there. There was a paint program that went by the.
[00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:41.360]   Was it was it called Max? Max. That's the one I'm thinking of. Was it Max? Yeah, Max is like a
[00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:46.720]   Picasa, I think. Yeah, it's a and it's you can only get it if you are a genuine Windows user.
[00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:51.520]   Like who cares? What does that mean? Who cares? I don't want it.
[00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:58.720]   Genuine Windows. So what do you guys think of France in the passage of this new DRM law
[00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:06.880]   and its effects on I guess pretty much iTunes. They but I can't understand what the issue is.
[00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:11.520]   Well, I think it's a little bit of it. Here I am again defending the bad guys,
[00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:17.920]   but I think it's a legitimate issue, which is that it's a fair play. It's a fair play DRM law.
[00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:22.000]   It says that if you're going to sell something that has well,
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:26.960]   copy protection, like all the music that you purchase out of iTunes music store,
[00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:32.320]   the fair play junk part of the losses that you got to let it be compatible with competing
[00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:37.360]   with other people's music players. But there are there are some apps.
[00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:39.840]   Creative jukebox or something that you should be able to play your
[00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:44.800]   iTunes downloaded music. And I think that's fair. I mean, I think it's trying to break Apple's
[00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:50.640]   monopoly is iTunes iPod access, but there are legitimate outs. If the artists and the labels say,
[00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:56.880]   oh, that's okay, then you don't have to share your DRM. Well, the the out is saying make an
[00:42:56.880 --> 00:43:02.800]   exclusive deal with a company to distribute your music. Oh, I see. So if somebody else is selling
[00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:07.280]   it, then you're out of luck. So if you're if you're if you're the Beatles or whoever owns the
[00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:12.800]   Beatles, I guess is Michael Jackson. Yeah. And want to distribute Beatles music, which they're not able
[00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:17.440]   to do on iTunes right now. Anyway, but if you want to distribute it specifically for the Nomad jukebox,
[00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:24.160]   you know, you can sign a deal with Michael Jackson and tell Apple to go, you know, do whatever they
[00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:27.440]   want to do. I know. I'm not I'm still not getting this what you're saying. Well,
[00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:34.000]   we can't do that before. Well, this I mean, the short answer is is that the law is supposed to,
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:38.720]   the law does two things. One, it does what it's supposed to in theory, which is allow interoperability
[00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:44.160]   so that so that I can play any secured music on any player. Right. That's the theory.
[00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:51.760]   Right. And then they had a loophole inside of that that said, Apple can basically not allow
[00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:56.960]   its music to be played on competitors players if and only if they get the permission from the
[00:43:56.960 --> 00:44:02.240]   artist to do so. Right. There's also some the open source community was a little upset about it
[00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:08.160]   because if there is, you know, they would have to provide this information on interoperability under
[00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:15.040]   NDA and it would actually leave open source developers out of the loop and and that or if they were
[00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:19.120]   in the loop, they couldn't publish the source code. It would no longer be open source. So Richard
[00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:28.240]   Stalman was a little upset about that. Am I wrong? And it hasn't the hacking community
[00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:34.800]   busted this this system by now so you could take an iTunes and piece of music and run it on and
[00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:38.880]   hold them. Anybody's in it? No, actually they did for a while. In fact, it was DVD John or
[00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:44.000]   Jan. I don't know how you pronounce it. He cracked it. He cracked the fair play copy protection and
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:49.280]   created a program called Play Fair. But then Apple updated iTunes and ever since version six,
[00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:54.160]   it's it's it hasn't worked. You haven't been able to strip it out unless you unless you the only
[00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:59.520]   way I know to do it is to burn a CD and yeah, the analog hole. Go through the virtual CD. They're
[00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:03.440]   trying to get the analog hole plugged to I don't know what the status of that is in Congress as
[00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:12.720]   long as we're covering it. Yeah, I just like holes. He's an Alaska hole actually. Yeah, are we
[00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:20.640]   talking about Ted again? Ted again. I was back. Good. Yeah, there is a push to close the audio
[00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:26.000]   hole and the video of course macro vision does in effect close the video hole unless you know how
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:33.280]   to get around it. But but they're trying to do that with audio too where they're encoding what
[00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:39.520]   ultrasonic things that create distortion unless it's the original copy. Pretty soon they're having
[00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:43.200]   so you can't even hear it yourself. Yeah, you have to pay them a dollar every time you listen.
[00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:48.720]   Can you just your ears? You need ears implanted. DRM ears.
[00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:55.760]   You have to borrow some ears. Somebody to be made somebody has scammed the Nigerian scammers.
[00:45:55.760 --> 00:46:01.360]   It's an interesting story from Australia. There is I didn't you know the 419 scams where the
[00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:08.480]   Nigerian say I have $15 million help me get it out and I'll give you 10%. So there is a a for an
[00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:15.680]   anti-419 site and the guy who runs it he says my goal is just to keep the 419 scammers so busy they
[00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:20.160]   don't have time to steal and these are these scams actually are surprisingly effective given
[00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:25.280]   how much publicity and how hard far fetched it is. There's been a few famous people that
[00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:30.000]   were busted a guy caught in these scams. By the way there's another group that's been doing this a
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:34.080]   lot longer than these guys. Oh really? And I had blogged them a couple years ago and it's still on
[00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:39.040]   the blog somewhere and they but this guy took it to one other extreme he would actually start to
[00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:44.000]   you know he would agree to do all this stuff and then he'd give these guys to run around and
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:48.320]   eventually I almost get you know get them to do silly things. That's what this yeah this is okay
[00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:51.760]   well it's maybe the same I don't know they've been around for a while the website's called
[00:46:51.760 --> 00:47:00.240]   419 eater.com and the guy says pseudonym is shiver me timbers and he basically he's been
[00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:07.760]   getting these 419ers to do things for him in this case wooden sculptures of a Commodore 64 keyboard.
[00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:19.600]   It's so awesome. Apparently the show of the show of good faith is is critical to any confidence game.
[00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:26.080]   That's right. That's the good thing. I really like that. Okay I just looked it up these guys this
[00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:31.680]   this is a boot space historic even kind of more interesting in some weird way. The 409 eater I
[00:47:31.680 --> 00:47:37.600]   actually first blogged it in 717 2004 so these guys are obviously going around the horn again with
[00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:43.760]   the publicity for themselves. Well good for them. I didn't really have the next level. They got some
[00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:51.200]   yeah well they jerks do carve out in the top Commodore 64. That's a good one. Well he had the
[00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:56.960]   picture I have from like two years ago they created a fake church and got these guys to join it and
[00:47:56.960 --> 00:48:00.720]   they had to like you know put all kinds of weird markings on their bodies and then send pictures
[00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:06.000]   around so it's just a group of people like to humiliate dummies. And then what they the best part
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:10.640]   is that they sent to the so they got the Nigerian this this is the good faith. They got the Nigerian
[00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:16.880]   scammer to carve this keyboard and smother intricate little models and then they sent a note from the
[00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:22.080]   police the Australian police saying you've been dealing with a notorious art forcher
[00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:27.520]   who's been arrested. Oh we're so sorry you got scammed. I just love it. I think it's
[00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:34.320]   given more publicity John. Yeah they they we actually we blog this particular story too
[00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:38.240]   because they there's a one picture they apparently have carving all kinds of stuff. Yeah I think
[00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:41.520]   that was creative because you can get the carvings it'd be kind of nice to have them run the house.
[00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:46.160]   Yeah then they would they would use Photoshop to distort the picture and say oh no it got hurt
[00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:50.720]   somehow and transit you need to send us another one. I love it. I just I think that's funny thing
[00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:56.000]   to tie up these guys and not. So it was a very good New Yorker article about a month ago about
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:01.600]   fella who got a preacher in fact got sucked so deep in the 419 scam that he was actually
[00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:06.240]   prosecuted in the US and convicted of a felony because he started passing checks and so forth.
[00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:12.560]   Well remember when we did the the Q&A with the Secret Service. Yeah I mean the thing they said is
[00:49:12.560 --> 00:49:19.360]   they they still investigate hundreds and hundreds of 419 scams every year and they wish they didn't
[00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:24.080]   have to frankly they they think they're better things to be doing. How do you know how do people
[00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:29.600]   get so out of touch that I mean this has been going on for years. I mean people have written
[00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:33.600]   columns about it. There's been a million things and they just still don't get the word out. I mean
[00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:39.280]   it's amazing to me. But there's always somebody new you know in the retirement community who gets
[00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:44.320]   their first computer or whatever and well it's not just a retirement community.
[00:49:44.320 --> 00:49:50.240]   Stevens from Alaska is falling for it. Wouldn't that be funny if he got scammed?
[00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:57.840]   You know there's people in Nigeria who have internet access and they're paying for it.
[00:49:57.840 --> 00:50:06.320]   I actually I think we should maybe form a scam Steven society and just tend to be
[00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:12.800]   behind big telco and I would like to officially distance myself from this conversation.
[00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:18.480]   No no I really think this is nothing. I'm the one who usually I have absolutely no interest in
[00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:23.040]   nothing illegal absolutely. Yeah yeah it's not the illegal I'm worried about.
[00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:30.720]   Yes kidding. Wait a minute. Can't. Wait a minute. Is there anything illegal about us forming a telco?
[00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:38.000]   I don't think there's any actual reason to have any capital equipment or anything silly like that.
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:43.280]   We could we could simply organize ourselves a telco hire ourselves a lobbyist.
[00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:46.080]   I've got for Patrick you know he's a very honest looking guy.
[00:50:46.080 --> 00:50:53.920]   Plus I'm in a cheap rug from Sears and yeah so I mean here's our man in Washington.
[00:50:53.920 --> 00:50:59.840]   A couple of lunches and I'd say we'd have the guy dead to rights.
[00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:04.720]   Senator Stevens I want to tell you about what you what you have me
[00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:08.960]   considering about net neutrality which you really need to embrace for the citizens that are going
[00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:13.840]   to be elected next year for the yeah. I love this. You're on a roll dude. Keep
[00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:21.280]   my other suit man. So David Pogan his column New York Times columnist David Pogan is column on
[00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:28.240]   the internet reveals that in fact the Toshiba high def DVD player the first HD DVD player which
[00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:37.520]   costs $500 actually loses Toshiba $200 on every player. It costs more than 700 to make. So why
[00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:43.920]   he says are they making it and he says that in fact Microsoft he believes he has no evidence for
[00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:49.760]   this that Microsoft is underwriting it. Oh please you know what planet did he come from anyway.
[00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:55.280]   This kind of marketing has been going on forever. If you buy the first plasmas that come out just
[00:51:55.280 --> 00:52:00.640]   shipping about a $500 bill with each one. Excuse me how many how many millions of console game
[00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:06.240]   a console game you always sold that a lot. I mean this is not a lot of cell phones sold it is
[00:52:06.240 --> 00:52:11.440]   lost by every all right all right all right all right. Maybe they used to I don't know you know
[00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:15.680]   this is like I you know his next article is going to be about how some lawyers are crooked. I mean
[00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:23.680]   come on. Well here's an interesting thing because I just I just uh logged into this article and
[00:52:23.680 --> 00:52:28.240]   it's got an address an email address for me. I don't know where it got it but I haven't had in 10 years
[00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:33.360]   so I don't know what's going on there. Maybe they does the New York Times keep track of my old email
[00:52:33.360 --> 00:52:39.360]   addresses. Obviously they do. There's a conspiracy theory we've got going there. Maybe they have a
[00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:46.000]   reason to. Maybe I don't know. Anyway yeah that's right that's the thing and they have the apparently
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:49.120]   the blue right they're going to sell you know they're not going to make any money on that either they
[00:52:49.120 --> 00:52:53.520]   may not sell it at a $200 loss. Well yeah that one's several hundred dollars more expensive than the
[00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:59.760]   H&B. It's a doubt. Yeah so that's why you that's why you got to buy the Sony PS3 it's only 500 bucks.
[00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:05.120]   Yeah that's all okay. Hey ship me one tomorrow David. Okay I'll take you over to the house.
[00:53:05.120 --> 00:53:11.760]   I'm waiting I told my son you can have a game console as soon as Sony's PS3 comes out let's wait
[00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:18.480]   for that. And wait. And wait. I mean the other thing is a lot of a lot of these estimates of what
[00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:24.640]   you know what devices cost to build. I've noticed a lot of them tend not to take in little things
[00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:29.120]   like bulk discounts or existing relationships with part suppliers. It's hard for hard to really
[00:53:29.120 --> 00:53:34.000]   know how much it costs. Yeah you can get pretty close. I'm not saying you can't get pretty close
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:38.080]   but some of them have been sort of you know I've seen some that listed close to retail prices for
[00:53:38.080 --> 00:53:42.000]   parts. You know I don't know it's interesting it's it's Tashiba's actually already started
[00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:48.000]   Tashiba's already already started saying that they're actually making a profit on these boxes.
[00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:55.040]   Really? Yeah it's the good bookkeeper you can make a profit on anything. Yeah well I mean it's
[00:53:55.040 --> 00:54:00.320]   interesting that Tashiba came back that quickly and was like this is ridiculous. Early adopters are
[00:54:00.320 --> 00:54:06.080]   there of the HD DVD player already. They seem to be selling out. They said they were sold out.
[00:54:06.080 --> 00:54:12.400]   Yeah I mean well I mean well I'm looking for a John. I mean I can't I mean they built supposedly
[00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:18.080]   they built around 10,000 in the first run and we were actually trying to find one to purchase to
[00:54:18.080 --> 00:54:23.600]   do a comparison with the Blu-ray player. We had the Samsung Blu-ray player in which is pretty good
[00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:28.080]   unit. It's unfortunate the initial one of Blu-ray discs aren't that hot but the Blu-ray player is
[00:54:28.080 --> 00:54:33.520]   pretty solid. So they wouldn't send you a review unit because they were so hot off the press? No
[00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:39.040]   we couldn't find any for sale in northern California. I mean we couldn't find any for sale that
[00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:43.360]   weren't being delayed for a couple weeks. So they may actually have sold out completely on the first
[00:54:43.360 --> 00:54:49.600]   run of those. I mean they're picking up some momentum. They got 70 or 90 titles out already.
[00:54:49.600 --> 00:54:53.840]   So it'll be interesting to see how fast Blu-ray comes out. Well I don't get you know to be honest
[00:54:53.840 --> 00:54:58.480]   about it because you talk about these things and having a run. I don't know why these things are
[00:54:58.480 --> 00:55:03.520]   having a run at all. They should be in continuous production. They don't make runs of a device that
[00:55:03.520 --> 00:55:07.920]   they're going to be you know putting into the public at these kinds of numbers and millions and
[00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:12.640]   millions of units eventually. It doesn't make sense to me that there's not a ship coming over right
[00:55:12.640 --> 00:55:17.200]   now. We loaded up with these unless they just sent a bunch of tests or maybe the ones that just
[00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:21.280]   cost too much to make and they got a cheaper one they're working on. It seems logical to me that
[00:55:21.280 --> 00:55:24.960]   they do run because what if they don't sell on the first run then all of a sudden they don't
[00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:31.680]   they don't have to spend as much money on increasing their losses. Well then they get some pretty poor
[00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:36.960]   marketing or market planning it seems to me. I don't think that these guys roll out a product that
[00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:40.880]   that's discomplicated without knowing exactly what the demand is going to be.
[00:55:40.880 --> 00:55:47.280]   All right so what is the real demand driver for HD DVD is it sports or porn?
[00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:55.200]   Neither. Always asking the tough questions. It's regular movies. No no no it's a beautiful
[00:55:55.200 --> 00:56:02.080]   nature documentaries. Well there aren't any. There isn't any. The cherry blossoms I get it. The cherry
[00:56:02.080 --> 00:56:07.600]   blossoms. Well there's no prawn. There's no nature documentaries and there's no
[00:56:07.600 --> 00:56:15.200]   and there's no just a bunch of amelite itches. Yo yo yo yo. There's no good movies. There's actually
[00:56:15.200 --> 00:56:19.840]   some really good movies. Okay. I'm sorry. Favorite right now still being good fellows and it's also
[00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:24.400]   really good transfers. Are they doing a good job for the transfers? That's that actually is.
[00:56:24.400 --> 00:56:29.840]   I think the HD DVD ones seem to have been it's interesting that we've got pretty much all the first
[00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:34.880]   five or six Blu-ray titles in house and what's shocking about a couple of them is that either
[00:56:34.880 --> 00:56:40.000]   they couldn't get a decent film to scan for the transfer or they didn't care because you're looking
[00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:46.960]   at you're looking at scratches in the film and specs and dirt and it's really it's quite
[00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:52.080]   impressive when you're looking at it. Wow. It sounds like they were rushed in that case. I
[00:56:52.080 --> 00:56:56.240]   mean maybe they didn't have the opportunity to get pristine prints. Well there's there's a lot of
[00:56:56.240 --> 00:57:00.960]   there's a lot of interesting dialogue about how they're handling the initial run of Blu-ray discs
[00:57:00.960 --> 00:57:08.080]   and you know how much what level of security is being employed on them and and it's uh it's
[00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:12.320]   interesting but I mean the biggest the Samsung player itself is doing a really good job right.
[00:57:12.320 --> 00:57:17.360]   It's a it's a smidge faster than the she but this she was essentially a Linux box.
[00:57:17.360 --> 00:57:23.120]   Right. Um and you know we're waiting for the reason. Well here's the thing one of the reasons
[00:57:23.120 --> 00:57:26.720]   we're waiting for the for another review unit to come in is because supposedly they've done a
[00:57:26.720 --> 00:57:30.640]   pretty hefty firmware upgrade that's going to improve a lot of the performance issues. Are they
[00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:34.560]   can they push those out or do you have to bring yours in to get it up to us? It's designed to be
[00:57:34.560 --> 00:57:39.840]   pushed it's designed to be pushed out and done over the internet school so that's very clever
[00:57:39.840 --> 00:57:44.240]   of there's very smarter than I think probably made more of a part of it. Patrick when you talk
[00:57:44.240 --> 00:57:47.840]   about these movies that you've looked at that you say they did a crappy you know and they got
[00:57:47.840 --> 00:57:54.640]   the scratch are people standing up and moving around and this is somebody in the audience get up
[00:57:54.640 --> 00:58:00.640]   and is that the kind of that's not good. This is not good. Well I mean it's kind of like you
[00:58:00.640 --> 00:58:05.520]   laugh right you go to you know you go to see you know you go to see you go to remember like you
[00:58:05.520 --> 00:58:10.240]   go to a movie in a theater and it's been out for five or six weeks and occasionally you see like
[00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:17.120]   some scuffs or some splices or a little scratch word yeah and uh and this is this is better than
[00:58:17.120 --> 00:58:21.280]   that but it's still highly noticeable because like you're looking at this right and it's you know
[00:58:21.280 --> 00:58:26.400]   you're looking at these movies and you're thinking like okay what do we got here Terminator you know
[00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:30.720]   not not the priciest film stock used to shoot that but you know you're looking at some of the other
[00:58:30.720 --> 00:58:35.120]   Blu-ray titles that are available and you're sitting there and going what was I'm trying to think of
[00:58:35.120 --> 00:58:38.400]   one I was watching where I was sitting there going like wow there's no scratch there's no scratch
[00:58:38.400 --> 00:58:44.800]   there's no scratch. Blue and HD right no Blu-ray no I'm talking about Blu-ray the HCD-BD stuff one of
[00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:50.640]   the one of the most amazing experiences I've ever had with home theater was was looking at Goodfellas
[00:58:50.640 --> 00:58:58.640]   in HD DVD on like a 16-inch monitor because it's it looked amazing yeah you know wait wait one more
[00:58:58.640 --> 00:59:04.560]   I interrupt one more time now what you're describing is kind of weird it seems to me because I have
[00:59:04.560 --> 00:59:09.520]   seen these same movies not all of them that I saw in that pile but I've seen that pile but I've seen
[00:59:09.520 --> 00:59:15.120]   Terminator and some of these others and or they're you know and I have seen them on on Mark
[00:59:15.120 --> 00:59:21.200]   Cubans HD net and I've seen them on HBO and and eight and high def on a big projector and I've
[00:59:21.200 --> 00:59:26.800]   never seen these scratches well where did they rescan these old films I mean why don't they just
[00:59:26.800 --> 00:59:31.600]   take I mean these have been digitized by somebody else before I just baffling to me what you're saying
[00:59:31.600 --> 00:59:37.360]   1080p though it probably did have to redo it because they probably never did it at 1080p
[00:59:37.360 --> 00:59:43.520]   well I guess what else would they do it in I don't know yeah I'm wondering what what they would
[00:59:43.520 --> 00:59:49.360]   have scanned it uh 720 I don't know but uh make sense that it's well this is I mean this is this I
[00:59:49.360 --> 00:59:54.960]   mean I don't know the first of all you know I have no idea whether Cuban is doing his own scans for
[00:59:54.960 --> 00:59:58.880]   his network or whether or not he's using I mean because there are a lot of people you know anybody
[00:59:58.880 --> 01:00:04.960]   can get a print can scan a video right not necessarily legally but it was it was it seemed like you
[01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:10.160]   know I can totally see a situation where somebody went you know grab five Tony Sony films ran them
[01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:15.520]   down to somebody had them scanned and then encoded them really fast to make the delivery that's what
[01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:19.840]   I think it is I think they were rushed and I'm sure they'll fix it and well what studio is behind
[01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:24.800]   this release how you know what studio is going to put their their name on grab wonder yeah you wonder
[01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:32.400]   well I mean I scandal scandalous well I'd be mad if I bought a thousand dollar Blu-ray player and I
[01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:39.120]   all I saw was scratched up old movie you know I just yeah I actually wanted to ask Bill McCrone about
[01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:44.000]   the decision that Microsoft made not to ship a standalone version of the win file system that
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:51.840]   would have win a fast file system with Vista is that significant uh I mean they took it out of Vista
[01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:56.320]   they they they promised it in Vista took it out but said well we'll ship it standalone later
[01:00:56.320 --> 01:01:02.160]   and then last week they announced uh or it was hard to determine what they were trying to say but
[01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:05.840]   it sounded like they weren't going to ever do a standalone version they're they're not going to
[01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:12.400]   do it and I've got to think that that is some hedge yet another hedge against the open source
[01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:22.320]   community uh there there are so many things uh going on there and the yeah the open source operating
[01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:27.520]   systems are gaining so much power that I that I have to think that it's just another attempt to
[01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:36.000]   keep people locked into Windows and TFS and Windows Server yeah exactly so in other words if they
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:40.480]   shipped a new file system and it's of course a data basing file system with better search and so
[01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:46.400]   forth if they did that you're afraid their fear is that people would just ignore it and go to open
[01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:54.480]   source solutions um or that the open source solutions would hook on to the new file system
[01:01:54.480 --> 01:02:04.000]   and so forth would start exactly and uh and just run it uh I mean we're we're seeing uh well AMD
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:09.840]   and Inteller involved in this kind of stuff too you know because they're they're both feeding the
[01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:15.280]   open source community and trying to keep it at arms length in order to maintain their relationship
[01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:22.320]   with Microsoft and uh you know tuck up they're doing an even better job uh than the politicians
[01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:29.600]   that double speak you know trying to uh keep both ends from meeting in the middle speaking of AMD
[01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:35.440]   and Intel Intel is really making a push now to take back some of the the ground it's lost from AMD
[01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:40.640]   over the last couple of years in and making announcements of new chips uh new Xeon chips and so
[01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:48.960]   forth that they say will be AMD. Patrick are you guys doing any testing bill anybody take a look
[01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:56.240]   at these? I'm not been looking at the uh the technology and uh you know basically you know
[01:02:56.240 --> 01:03:04.480]   Intel's problem is they they went off on that uh branch prediction branch and uh these really
[01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:10.160]   land these pipelines and really really long pipelines and they said no it's no problem because you know
[01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:16.560]   the cache is deep and if it clutches well code was never as pretty as Intel's engineers said it
[01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:22.960]   was going to be so uh that started with Prescott which was just a yeah oh yeah it's it's it's an
[01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:29.520]   old problem that uh unfortunately took over the product line and really hurt Xeon much more than
[01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:34.800]   the uh the desktop which surprises me because you would think that server code would be more
[01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:40.240]   regular but I get I guess eight you know even HTTP services you know the world throws so much
[01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:47.040]   crap at your server right that you'd better be able to switch horses really quickly to keep up
[01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:50.960]   with it all. So what is Intel doing I mean are they doing a wrist chip? I mean how are they?
[01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:56.080]   Yeah I mean they're basically emulating their own instruction set and shortening their pipeline
[01:03:56.080 --> 01:04:05.680]   and uh doing everything they can to make the uh the chip more facile and also give it uh more
[01:04:05.680 --> 01:04:12.160]   internal speed and less dependence on the front side bus uh I mean that was AMD's genius with the
[01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:18.320]   optaron is that they basically said we've got hyper transport which they announced what six years
[01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:24.560]   ago work uh and took a while for Intel to catch up to that uh and I don't know that they've
[01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:32.560]   actually caught up I think that uh we have if you look at what Sun and uh fabric 7 and some of these
[01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:40.640]   uh hot server companies are doing with 8-way AMD servers uh they're rocket ships right they are
[01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:48.160]   really fast machines uh you know no zion can touch them. Well in fact uh Dell has announced
[01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:54.160]   that it's buying a bunch of AMD chips for its servers which is a big shift for just isn't that
[01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:58.800]   amazing. I mean we've all heard Michael Dell and all those people proclaim to their you know their
[01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:04.400]   undying loyalty to Intel. You know we haven't seen you know I talked to the guy that runs that
[01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:10.800]   division he was in town the other couple weeks ago uh the Dell guy and I specifically asked him
[01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:14.960]   about this because we've always known that these guys are pretty much you know they're wetted uh
[01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:19.920]   Dell and Intel all there's been some some there's been a few industry hiccups between the two of them
[01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:24.400]   because Dell's become such a big customer for Intel that Intel doesn't like that because they
[01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:28.800]   don't like to have you know a customer telling you what to do and meanwhile you know uh Dell's been
[01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:35.520]   loyal and back and forth so I asked them specifically if they if at the drop of a hat uh Intel
[01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:41.920]   improved either their chips or their deal if they drop AMD like a lead balloon.
[01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:46.000]   It's not a loaded question or anything. No I try to be blunt when I ask these questions you get a
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:50.480]   better answer that way and the answer which was of course not a great answer but it's kind of
[01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:56.160]   answered it with the guy said specifically says we'll always go with the best technology out there
[01:05:56.160 --> 01:06:02.400]   never of course said yes or no to the question but what he said to me was and with the hints
[01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:08.320]   out there that Intel's got some hot stuff coming this whole thing may have been a big bluff you know
[01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:14.480]   even though you like Bill said they those eight-way machines are apparently just rocket ships maybe
[01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:20.880]   it just indicates a weakening in Intel's market power and uh and Dell could finally safely say well
[01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:27.200]   we're not tied anymore. But those in the last couple of years and Dell's and Dell's really
[01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:33.040]   cotton pig in the last couple of years. Right. I've been told by some people that are in the chip
[01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:38.880]   business that that uh Intel because Dell was buying so many chips and they were getting such a good
[01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:44.720]   deal from Intel that Intel was get was telling Dell and this may or may not be true but the Intel
[01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:48.240]   was telling Dell that you know where are you you know they get you so many you're gonna have to go
[01:06:48.240 --> 01:06:53.360]   to the gray market to get the rest of the your your requirements because we just can't provide
[01:06:53.360 --> 01:06:58.880]   that many chips and Intel in fact was shipping chips over to the gray market so they get a little
[01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:04.720]   few more dollars from Dell because there were it was hurting the bottom line now that old story
[01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:10.240]   it is an old story but it's been the crop it's an old story I mean that's what the chip companies do
[01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:18.400]   yes and but this story cropped up recently around this Dell deal and then it just within a you know
[01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:23.520]   six months after I heard that story this announcement comes out about the AMD chips which we still
[01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:28.480]   really haven't seen so I think this is a political thing well it's that's my story I'm sticking to it
[01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:34.080]   you know it doesn't it doesn't hurt anybody if it is just saber rattling it helps AMD just by
[01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:41.600]   reputation even if they never sell a single chip to uh to Dell and uh yeah and and they're still
[01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:47.200]   sitting on top of the server world so these everybody wants up to run these new uh zions aren't
[01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:55.120]   enough you think to not AMD off the perch no because AMD's got their their quad chips if not
[01:07:55.120 --> 01:08:01.280]   quite ready to go uh they're they're pretty close they're you know they have a huge new plant that's
[01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:10.400]   cranking out all the 65 nanometer stuff that they can make uh and they're ready to up their uh
[01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:15.760]   their speeds well actually they don't want to go much faster in speed uh they're they're finding
[01:08:15.760 --> 01:08:22.640]   especially with hyper transport that they can just put more CPUs on the chip and uh get more and
[01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:26.880]   more performance yeah and more level to catch well my understanding is that there's a hot chip
[01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:31.520]   coming out from Intel as a desktop chip that's going to be a mind-blower you mean the core duo
[01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:36.480]   the core two-door stuff that's coming out like yes is that essentially a four-way uh core
[01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:44.000]   I don't think so I think it's just a fast four just a faster doer it's a fast yeah the core two duo is
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:51.920]   the update the higher internal speed core duo eight-hundred uh buzz in the whole thing yeah I mean it's
[01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:57.920]   it's fast but uh consumer part and they're releasing it you know this month and they're releasing it
[01:08:57.920 --> 01:09:02.160]   from the low end of the high end and that's staggering the delivery that a lot of the initial
[01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:07.200]   benchmarking is putting it in many cases 30 percent faster than anything AMD's got right
[01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:12.320]   uh you know and there's going to be cheap versions of it too but you know how long is it you know
[01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:17.200]   AMD may have something up in sleep I mean I don't I don't think AMD is I don't think AMD has anything
[01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:21.440]   up its sleeve until the four by force for the consumers till the four by four could be better
[01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:25.520]   this month or maybe later this year they're surprisingly they're doing they're doing a single
[01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:30.960]   quarter that can't be really used to optimal surprisingly they're doing a single core
[01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:34.960]   con road too which I mean I thought that the whole single core stuff was just gone I mean
[01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:41.280]   well there's there's still a lot of single execution thread games out there and that's where the
[01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:49.840]   original AMD 64 right uh stole Intel thunder right and I think they you know they need that chip
[01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:56.880]   for reputation as much as anything else for gaming yeah because the gamers drive so much
[01:09:56.880 --> 01:10:04.720]   right uh you know upgrade every time there's something new yeah yeah they can so you can
[01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:11.360]   frag your your buddies even faster you know well just remember the internet is just a tomb my
[01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:16.880]   friends and well I hope one of the I hope I'm hoping upon hope that these new faster chips in the
[01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:22.240]   competition between AMD and Intel no matter what the politics are actually results in some new
[01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:26.720]   applications coming out that can be useful to the average user because right now it's nice to have
[01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:30.720]   these screaming machines especially if you're running Photoshop for the most part I'd like to
[01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:34.800]   see you know some new uses I mean we haven't had any really great new uses for these
[01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:39.280]   computers you've been saying this for years John where's the new killer app I'm like an old man
[01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:43.120]   where's the new but you're been off my lawn you've been right there really hasn't been a
[01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:48.400]   killer app in the way that you know Lotus 123 was a killer app or VisiCal and sometime
[01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:53.600]   that was a killer app it was just like the original app there was the original the first
[01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:58.480]   then the reason that was VisiCalc you know you can also say home theater PCs is probably the
[01:10:58.480 --> 01:11:03.760]   maybe last you know home theater PCs VoIP I mean what are the other big things that have come out
[01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:10.480]   in the last couple years online video delivery true well do you need faster chips for that I mean
[01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:18.160]   one of the things where I see a performance increase is rendering DVDs and as people do more and more
[01:11:18.160 --> 01:11:25.520]   burning you know you can get pretty close to real time on a really hot machine but John wants
[01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:32.480]   something new that's just video it's old now what's the new compelling yeah it's just a faster disc
[01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:42.320]   maybe we need to develop a new sense you know something you know that's that kind of reads the
[01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:48.400]   gigahertz directly or something and then and then these new machines can play right into it
[01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:54.720]   I do know I'm running the skype program on this fast AMD machine I have here I have a dual core
[01:11:54.720 --> 01:12:00.640]   it's a better job sounds good it sounds a lot better than I ran it on my my old northwood which
[01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:06.400]   was you know fast for its day but you know just so there's something about there there are some
[01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:11.120]   processing going on there's necessary oh yeah oh yeah plus there's also the whole Vista performance
[01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:17.840]   tax yeah well anytime there's a new operating system you're always paying some overhead
[01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:22.960]   some significant amount of overhead but but Vista is designed for dual core machines for all
[01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:27.600]   intents and purposes you really don't want to run that on a single core machine unless it's a
[01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:34.480]   rocket ship and a gigabyte of RAM and yeah yeah I am running it on a you know like a
[01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:43.280]   AMD 2500 with you know 750 megabytes of RAM and I got to say it's it's not a thrilling experience
[01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:49.520]   but it runs are you getting arrow and glass or do you have you done like arrow and glass is no
[01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:54.880]   problem there that's really a lot of video functionality of glass you know glass is really all about
[01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:59.840]   glass is really all about having a fast video car with a whole bunch of memory
[01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:04.480]   and we got to wrap this up it's but I bill I'm so glad you could join us it was really great to
[01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:09.520]   have you my pleasure yeah and well we'll help you come back and join us again Bill McCrone is
[01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:16.240]   founded the Ziff Davis Labs founded the original tech TV back in '94 and '93 and longest running
[01:13:16.240 --> 01:13:23.040]   column in history well long as technology column we'll say that
[01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:30.480]   uh mr. Lefort uh Miss Landers is on the line she's dead she can't hurt me now yeah she's dead
[01:13:30.480 --> 01:13:37.920]   and still doing a column that's amazing that's talent you can catch cranky-geats and of course
[01:13:37.920 --> 01:13:45.920]   dltv online at dl.tv and john's column is at dvorak.org/blog and David Craig
[01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:50.160]   PC Magazine and Mark and Mark and watch and we didn't get around to talking about your
[01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:53.840]   Mark and watch column this week and I wanted to we'll do it next week it's a good column yeah
[01:13:53.840 --> 01:14:00.560]   it's a good column David Prager is with revision three where they do dignity and system and
[01:14:00.560 --> 01:14:09.360]   control all chicken revision three dot com I thank you all another twit this week in tech
[01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:12.320]   is in the camp happy fourth of july happy and to finish day
[01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:35.520]   [Music]
[01:14:35.520 --> 01:14:37.760]   so do you want to do a twit today mr. Norton?
[01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:42.160]   uh man is actually unbury my computer i was like oh wow it's three
[01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:45.360]   see if i can find it good how about that we were actually i was just about to call it off this
[01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:52.160]   one so no more bad words in this episode 60 of this we can tick our in tick this we can tick
[01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:58.240]   this we can tick uh you know we could do a whole new podcast about uh speaking tech
[01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:05.040]   I don't know pests but what's not it's all right the pestle give me what's Yoshi's uh
[01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:10.080]   us that name we're too mr. Yoshi's on the list and they were one both in Japan
[01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:17.280]   yeah Yoshi's a game character in fact you know uh his real name in fact when he came to
[01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:21.680]   tech tv he was called Josh and Joshua but because we have a ton I said we can't call you Josh
[01:15:21.680 --> 01:15:27.280]   give me another name he said when I was a kid they call me Yoshi so I said okay you're Yoshi
[01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:28.240]   [Music]
[01:15:28.240 --> 01:15:34.160]   so I took the blame for him yeah he is Yoshi uh yes that's it actually was a good move I mean
[01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:38.960]   that's much better than Josh yeah Josh is the biggest one I can get him on get him on
[01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:43.440]   okay well there's time when you get pissed when you call him Josh it's kind of neat
[01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:46.640]   yeah he wants to be the Josh as if that's like somehow more dignified
[01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:49.840]   I still have all these that's Josh actually I can understand that
[01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:54.480]   I can understand that I can say is that my name is Chad is my grandfather's name
[01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:58.160]   in brain tech you know Patty's my mother's name so I don't check they like being called
[01:15:58.160 --> 01:16:01.040]   but either one of those hey this is kind of you know what's going on you know what's
[01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:06.000]   going on you know that doesn't bother me that much it's just well we don't call Leo Leo
[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:13.280]   that's my real name I try to but it's very difficult to get him on I never have done I
[01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:17.520]   work with Leo so I never I've never wanted to do it because I never wanted to start calling him
[01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:23.440]   Leo on the air do you prefer it yes it's dirty Leo I used to really are you ready
[01:16:25.440 --> 01:16:32.640]   yeah the Twitter army let me introduce the table mates
