[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:19.360]   It's time for Twit this week in Tech to show the covers. All the tech news of the week
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:25.960]   and we have a really unusual panel here. I'm excited because normally we try to, you know,
[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:30.240]   not too many people have never been on Twit before. And fortunately we have a couple of
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.880]   old timers. I'll start with Renee Ricci's to my right. He is of course at imore.com,
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.440]   a regular Mac break weekly. Good to have you. You're still in town.
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.600]   Absolutely. This is my WWDC Hangover. You just don't want to leave. It's just too much.
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.900]   I can't get airborne again. And from The Verge, and this is Deeter's first time Deeter
[00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.760]   Bone. It's great to have you, mobile editor at The Verge. Yeah, good to be here.
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.920]   And a friend of Renee's. I guess you guys work together. That's nice way of saying I
[00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:01.120]   was his old boss. Yes. It's old old. Former. Former. You look a lot like Ed Snowden actually.
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:06.360]   I don't, you don't know anything about the NSA, dude. No, not much. It's checking. It's
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.400]   not just me. The chat room says the same thing. Also, an old friend, a guy I used to work with
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.200]   at Tech TV at the screen savers. He was one of the funniest writers ever, a producer at
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:23.760]   the screen savers. He's now editor at Polygon, which is Vox's new game website. Russ Pitts.
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:29.080]   Great to have you. Hey, Leon. Good to have you. I'm glad to see you have your special
[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:34.200]   code gold sword. So we just want to make sure we're all armed with Minecraft like 8-bit
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:41.240]   instruments. So in case it gets rough, I wanted to have this hand. How's things going at Polygon?
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:46.040]   Very, very well, actually. You launched a couple of months. When did it launch officially?
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.360]   Officially launched, I want to say October of last year. So it's been about seven months.
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:56.360]   This was our first E3 as a Polygon and we all just went very, very well. Very fun. Vox, of course,
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:03.000]   used to do, did, still does SB Nation and then launched the Verge, both of which are amazing
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.960]   websites. Then decided to get into gaming in Polygon is like the Verge, really kind of the
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:14.200]   definitive gaming website. So I was really thrilled when Tom Merritt told me that you would take
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.560]   in a job at Polygon. That's great news. Really good. Thank you. Thank you so much.
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:23.640]   Welcome. First time on Twit for Deeter and Russ. And we'll talk about E3 in just a bit. But we
[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:28.680]   also have an old friend who's going to talk about something a little bit crazy. Well, dare I say
[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:35.480]   Looney. Trey, Trey Rachliff is here from Stuckincustums.com, our favorite photographer. You're back from
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:41.480]   China. You got into China. Yeah, I got into China. I got back out of China. Great success there.
[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:45.080]   So the visa was taken care of. Yeah, the last time you were here, you didn't, it was up in the
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.800]   air. You were supposed to leave the next day. And so you got to go and you went with the NEX7.
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:56.760]   How did you like that? I loved it. Yeah. So I did an experiment. I set my normal big Nikon D800
[00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:03.160]   to the side. And I replaced it with my Sony for the 10 days and not paid by Sony. He bought it
[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:09.720]   at retail. It's not some special advertising deal. No. No relationship with Sony. But you know,
[00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:14.760]   I'm not one of these old school guys that just tied to carrying around big iron and mirrors just
[00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:20.200]   because it's the biggest and the best. I think that these small mirrorless cameras, this is
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:26.440]   this is the future of photography. Well, and I'll tell you why I asked because when it came time to
[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:30.280]   Henry graduated from high school last week, when it came time to get him a graduation present,
[00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:35.480]   I got him an NEX7. Yeah, I thought I want to get him a nice camera. I want to light camera to take
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:40.440]   to college. And based on so I didn't make a mistake because you hadn't gotten back yet.
[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:48.200]   Tell me now. Is it too late? No, no, it's great. You know, there's only a few conditions when you
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:53.560]   need a big DSLR where that is still better. Maybe like high speed action type stuff or where you
[00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:58.520]   don't want to encounter the buffering. But exactly. Really, any except it'll take care of 99% of your
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:05.000]   needs. Yeah, good. So welcome back to Twit. He's in New Zealand. He's in Christchurch right now.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.680]   Tell us the story. You got a strange email from Google last week.
[00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:16.600]   Yeah, so they they sent me a note and they said, we can't tell you what's going on. Just sign.
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:22.360]   I was like, well, I knew it's Google X. So it's got to be cool. And they've only announced two
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:30.600]   Google X projects, you know, the self driving cars and the and the glasses. So this must have been
[00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:38.280]   cool. And it was this project loon. And it was this audacious, ambitious idea to surround the world
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:44.680]   with internet balloons. And they wanted me to come along and take some photos and just kind of see
[00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:48.840]   what was going on. It happened to be here in my backyard. That's totally coincidental. So I
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:53.960]   jumped in a car with my family and drove a few hours north from Queenstown up here to the
[00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:59.160]   Christchurch area and joined the team and started taking photos. It was a blast.
[00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:03.800]   So you actually got to document this. And I know there's there's already one video on stuck in
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:08.360]   customs.com. We're not looking at that right now. This is a Google video, but you shot one video
[00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:13.080]   and you have another one coming in a couple of days. That is in a lot of technical detail,
[00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:19.320]   discuss, you know, talking about what's going on here. But as soon as that video gets approved,
[00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:24.680]   it'll be at stuck in customs.com. But they were smart to ask you because here you are documenting.
[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:33.320]   This is the secret Google warehouse. So are these first of all, they're they're in the stratosphere.
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:41.080]   Yeah. So they're twice as high as commercial airlines. And there's basically nothing up there.
[00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:48.440]   There's no more weather. So they get solar power cleanly. And the big breakthrough about these
[00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:56.200]   balloons is that they can move up and down at various levels through the stratosphere.
[00:07:56.200 --> 00:08:01.400]   And as they move up and down, they can catch different air currents. So they can sort of keep
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:09.720]   this grid or matrix like mesh sort of Cartesian plane. They're not they're not
[00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:13.880]   going around the world. They're not attached by a 10 mile string to the earth.
[00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:20.360]   No, they've got a they've got a valve on the bottom. It's actually a two chamber balloon.
[00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:24.920]   And the top chamber is filled with helium. The bottom one is filled with regular air.
[00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:30.280]   And by pumping air in and out of the bottom chamber, they can move them up and down.
[00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:34.760]   Changing the density of the of the helium a little bit. But that's that's kind of
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:41.000]   is the same. But they they changed the weight of the balloon by pumping more air into the lower
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.360]   chamber. I get it. Yeah. So that's something you can keep doing kind of for at least until the
[00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:55.400]   balloon wears out. Yeah. So that's the big goal is to not fill up the balloon too much so that
[00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:59.880]   it pops or that gets these holes in it. You know, they're they're really trying to figure out a way
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:04.520]   to keep the balloons up there for a long time. But they have had balloons get up there and
[00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:09.000]   stay, you know, for months and years. I mean, this is ballooning is sort of an old science.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.760]   It's a tough it's a tough science. So they're trying to get their balloons to stay up as long as
[00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:18.200]   possible. Can you show this on my screenshot? This is the balloon going up. So you get a sense of it.
[00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:23.880]   They're doing this on New Zealand over New Zealand as an experiment. How many balloons do they
[00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:30.120]   launch over New Zealand? Dozens of dozens. I don't know the exact number. They've got this company
[00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:36.680]   called Raven Arrowstar that they partnered with and Raven Arrowstar. They're the guys that build all
[00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:41.320]   these huge weather balloons for NASA. They do all kinds of crazy stuff. So these guys are
[00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:44.520]   they're super hardcore. They know what's they know what they're doing. And how do they get the
[00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:52.200]   Internet access to the balloon? Well, so they have these big ground stations that are in cities or
[00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:58.040]   or, you know, in places where they definitely have a good solid wired internet connection into the
[00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:04.280]   into the backbone. And so your signal goes up from your house, you know, you have or your car or
[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:09.080]   or your little village or whatever it is. You have this little antenna that aims up at the sky.
[00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:14.200]   Here's a here's an image by the way of the antenna on Traza video. It's kind of cute. It looks like a
[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:18.680]   little balloon, a little red balloon. Yeah, it actually you can see a little if you look over there to
[00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:22.520]   the right, you can see a little white dot that's one of the loon balloons that is flying over.
[00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:27.640]   It's up here, huh? Yeah. Wow. It's quite tiny up in the sky. Yeah, you can see it. So these are visible
[00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:33.560]   on a clear day, you can't kind of see the balloon. That one is kind of still on its way up to the
[00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:37.800]   atmosphere. So they are really tough to see with an a good eye. They're pretty tiny. Yeah, I mean,
[00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:42.360]   they're 10 miles away. The signal goes up. It goes to one of the balloons and then it gets
[00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:47.480]   relayed around to other balloons until it finds a ground station, goes down, gets the data,
[00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:52.520]   then brings it back, you know, right? And in fact, there's as the balloons move over, there's a hand
[00:10:52.520 --> 00:11:00.760]   off just like a cell network. And so it's an interesting technology. What kind of speed do
[00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:08.440]   people get? Well, I went to a couple testers homes and we looked at it. It seemed perfectly
[00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:12.440]   broad bandish. I didn't jump on speed test dot net to see how fast it really was.
[00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:16.760]   But I remember the first time so I was in there with this is kind of a funny story.
[00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:21.960]   Yeah, I shouldn't tell it. But so I went into the first testers house and I was there with
[00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:25.880]   Stephen Levy from Wired Magazine who wrote a beautiful piece over there on Wired.
[00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:31.480]   By the way, one of my best photos that I took is going to show up in Wired Magazine. They got
[00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:35.960]   an exclusive on it. So the world hasn't seen that yet. So be sure to check out Stephen's article
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:40.440]   when it comes out in print. So anyway, what happened is we went into this testers home
[00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:48.440]   and they're getting internet. They're on trademe.co.nz which is sort of the local eBay. And then,
[00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:52.920]   of course, everyone in there, we want to connect and connect our cell phones or whatever and start
[00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:59.400]   playing with the internet. And so Stephen Levy's over there. He's connecting to it or whatever,
[00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:02.760]   then I went over and saw that people are connecting to it. I want to connect to it.
[00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:07.160]   So I go over and I ask the Google guys, I said, what's the password I want to get on?
[00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:13.800]   And they said, just a minute, Mr. Levy is on the internet. I was like, all right, I'll wait until
[00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:17.880]   he has an experience. I don't know what they thought I was going to do. Bit torrent, the game
[00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:25.000]   of thrones. Yeah, but I just want to know how it is. How funny. Yeah. So yeah, they're claiming
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:33.480]   3G speed. This is not to wire America. This is not to get cities online. This is for areas
[00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:39.240]   where there is no internet access. Well, they say that there's actually quite a few Americans
[00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:44.200]   that don't even have good internet access. I got a call from a guy in Montana, just the other days
[00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:48.920]   is there's no internet access available to me. But if you're in the first world, you'll probably
[00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:54.680]   use satellite and expensive satellite internet. Well, I think this will be quite disrupted the
[00:12:54.680 --> 00:13:00.360]   same way that fiber has been disrupted. So when fiber drops into a city, it drives competition
[00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:06.920]   crazy. Suddenly people have to provide unlimited internet or drop their prices. It is not just
[00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:11.720]   the access that I think is exciting. Here in New Zealand, actually, I think this is a pretty good
[00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:16.920]   test bed because I noticed this after I came from the US where I'm used to having unlimited
[00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:21.160]   internet. But people here, they don't really have unlimited internet in their homes. And I think
[00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:24.760]   this is actually very common in Europe and all over the world, we're quite spoiled in the US.
[00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:29.880]   And so I know that at home in Queenstown, I happen to have unlimited internet. I've got to have it,
[00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:35.960]   so I pay extra. But all of my sons friends who are 12 and 13, they come over and they can't believe
[00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:41.880]   that my son can watch limited YouTube videos. It's conceivable to them. And can you imagine
[00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:47.800]   being a kid growing up, not being allowed to watch maybe 10 or 20 YouTube videos a month?
[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:52.360]   Well, and it's a big deal for us as a twi, because it means that people in New Zealand really are
[00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:58.280]   going to be very careful about how much of us they watch. If you want to be an internet broadcaster,
[00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:02.680]   bandwidth caps are a bad thing. Yeah, it's a sucks to make a decision like,
[00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:07.640]   well, do I have enough bandwidth to download Leo's show this month? It's a horrible decision
[00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:15.640]   you have to make. So does Google, have they said they plan to offer this for free worldwide?
[00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:19.960]   They probably don't know what they plan to do with it or do that. Yeah, they don't really
[00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:24.760]   have a business model for it yet. I'm sure, I don't know what the business model is for fiber.
[00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:28.760]   I don't think they could buy that for free. They've always said that
[00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:33.640]   their goal as a company is get people to use the internet more. If people use the internet more,
[00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:39.160]   they'll make money because they're in an advertising company. Yeah, they just want to get more people
[00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:45.160]   on the net. And I don't think they want to be a giant ISP and make money from monthly charges.
[00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:48.600]   They just want to get people internet and then they do adwords and this sort of thing.
[00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:54.280]   Right. It seems like they have a business model. I don't know if it's enough to pay for the
[00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:58.200]   infrastructure. Who knows how much these balloons cost, but the model is pretty straightforward.
[00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:02.440]   The more people that use the internet, the more the world is connected. Both it's good for the
[00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:08.120]   world, but it's also good for Google. And this is why no nation's going to do this because it's
[00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:13.960]   floating all around the world. The UN isn't going to do this. I think it's going to be a company
[00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:19.960]   like the Google or the NSA. They might do it. That's a joke. It would be not such a big joke.
[00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:28.600]   So this is cool. So people, if you live in New Zealand, you can, if you go to google.com/loon,
[00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:33.880]   as they call it appropriately, the Loon Project, you can sign up as a tester.
[00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:38.920]   What do you think? I mean, this is a pretty cool tray.
[00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:43.080]   Yeah, I think it's great. It seems on the face of it goofy.
[00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:50.440]   Well, you know, this Rich Deval is kind of one of the guys behind this. It's a huge team, of course,
[00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:55.880]   but he and Mike Cassidy, they know it's an audacious plan and they're serious. They don't want to
[00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:59.480]   waste their time. They want to do something that's going to work and change the world and
[00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:05.400]   affect a billion plus people. These are all makers. They're all kind of burning man,
[00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:11.000]   kind of guys. They love building stuff. And they're having a ball. They're doing some serious
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:16.280]   science and they're really iterating in a Google way. So they're, I think they've got the right
[00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:20.600]   approach and the right attitude. And everyone's super excited about it, especially New Zealand.
[00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:25.880]   We sometimes we feel like the end of the world. So it's exciting to get stuff to launch here.
[00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:30.360]   I thought that was why you moved there. You want to be at the end of the world.
[00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:36.040]   So the idea, and we'll see what happens, but the idea is there's five billion people on the
[00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:41.480]   planet who are not connected to the internet right now. The vast majority, the idea is to connect as
[00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:47.720]   many of them as possible with hundreds, perhaps thousands of balloons floating at 60,000 feet
[00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:54.600]   above sea level, getting their internet access from base stations and big cities and passing along.
[00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:59.480]   And because it's so high, you could be in a valley. You don't have, I mean, you could be really in a
[00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:04.200]   very remote area surrounded by mountains and still be able to get internet access.
[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:09.720]   Yeah, no selfishly. I just want to put one of these little friendly red things on my truck.
[00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:13.800]   Yeah, because I'm driving around to these remote areas in New Zealand to take photos where there's
[00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:18.040]   no cell phone coverage. So I have zero internet. The idea that I could just have the internet
[00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:23.320]   floating above me all the time. It's intoxicating. It's awesome. And I see you're wearing your
[00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:31.160]   glass. You wear it all the time? Not in the shower. Good. That's the line that I draw. Yes.
[00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:35.720]   I do wear it. Actually, I find myself pulling out my cell phone very rarely. It's really.
[00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:41.080]   No more of that emasculating girly looking at your phone stuff. You're going to wear those
[00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:48.760]   macho blue glasses. Yeah, I can pull them off. Hey, Trey, always good to talk to you. Thank you
[00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:55.240]   for sharing that with us. Watch Trey's site stuck in customs.com because in the next day or so,
[00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:59.960]   there'll be a more technical description from behind the scenes. I guess lots of blackboard white,
[00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:04.760]   you know, whiteboard chalk talks and so forth about how this whole thing is supposed to work.
[00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:08.840]   Yeah, we'll get it up there. Thanks, Trey. Yes, sir. All right.
[00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:13.240]   I just talked to you again. Take care. Trey Radcliffe stuck in customs.com. We're going to take a
[00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:19.000]   break when we come back. E3 on the docket. Of course, WWDC. I have a little package from Apple here.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:25.240]   We might open. And whatever else is in the news, I guess we can talk about the NSA.
[00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:30.520]   There seems to be more revelations, even more revelations about the NSA spying,
[00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:35.720]   which seem to confirm Steve Gibson's hypothesis on Wednesday. He says he figured it out.
[00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:41.000]   He figured out what prison it was all about. And I have to say, I've seen no evidence to counter
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.760]   what he says is going on. And it's a little chilling. We'll talk about that in a little bit.
[00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:49.880]   Right now our show brought to you a little break. Our show brought to you by our friends at audible.com.
[00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:54.920]   Yet another reason to have unlimited internet so you can download great audio books everywhere.
[00:18:54.920 --> 00:19:01.400]   Father's Day. Happy five forgot to say happy Father's Day to Trey. Happy Father's Day. There's
[00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:06.120]   an audible section to send dad on a listening adventure. This would be a great Father's Day gift.
[00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:12.840]   It's a signed dad up for a bookstore with over 100,000 audio books. Does dad spend time
[00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:19.720]   in the car commuting at the gym working out washing dishes? There's all sorts of reasons why I listen
[00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:24.680]   to audible. Lots of times I want to listen or I want to read a book, but I can't hold a book. So I
[00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:29.000]   listen and I love it. When I go to bed at night now, listen to audible, whenever I'm in the car,
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:34.440]   whenever I'm doing anything, I've got audible going throughout the house. I love it. The audible
[00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:39.160]   apps that run on your smartphone, your iPhone, your Android device, your Windows phone, Windows 8,
[00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:45.880]   my Sonos has audible. Let me listen to all sorts of titles. I'm a big audible fan. We're
[00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:51.080]   going to give you a free audible account right now. If you go to audible.com/twit2, you can sign up
[00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:55.960]   for the platinum account. That's two books a month or two credits a month. It's basically two books.
[00:19:55.960 --> 00:20:02.120]   And your first month's free, you can get your first two books, cancel anytime in the first 30
[00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:06.040]   days, pay nothing. Those books are yours to keep. How about this? I think it'd be time to
[00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:13.560]   re-listen to 1984. They've got a new edition of 1984. That's book number one. What about that?
[00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:16.760]   You can choose. I just listened to the great Gatsby because I saw the movie and I thought,
[00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:25.240]   is this like the book? It was a great rendition by Jake Gyllenhaal. Is it Gyllenhaal or is it Jiff?
[00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:31.640]   How do you pronounce it? All sorts of great stuff. Julian Assange has a new book called
[00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:38.920]   Cypher Punks, Freedom and the Future of the Internet. Here's the problem choosing two great books.
[00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:44.280]   You've got to pick two. Your first two are free though. Audible.com, how about this?
[00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:49.960]   All the rave, the rise and fall of Sean Fanning's Napster. That's got to be interesting to listen to.
[00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:56.120]   The best readers bring these books to life. Audible.com/twit2 for your first two books.
[00:20:56.120 --> 00:21:01.240]   Absolutely. Free. Now the game of Thrones is over. You probably got some little extra time to listen.
[00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:05.800]   Audible books are great. I know you'll love them. But the best way to find out if they're
[00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:11.000]   right for you is to get those books for free. Audible.com/twit2 we thank of their support
[00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:17.800]   this weekend tech. I don't want to talk about it. I say right now we'll save that for. Let's talk
[00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:25.400]   about something fun. E3, Russ Pitts is here from Polygon. Your first E3 is a Polygon editor.
[00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:31.720]   It's our first E3 as a full fledged site. We were there last year. We were publishing our content on
[00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:37.080]   the Verge ramping up to launching our full site late last year. But this year was our first
[00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:45.160]   first E3 as the dedicated site as our own big editorial team. It was pretty exciting. It was
[00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:50.440]   probably the most exciting E3 I think. I've been covering games for about seven years, maybe eight
[00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:54.440]   years. A lot of the editors have been covering games for a little bit longer than that. Most
[00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:58.520]   exciting E3 I think any of us have seen. This is a really big transformative time in games right
[00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:04.200]   now. Yeah, primarily because of the new Xbox One and the PS4 both Microsoft and Sony had
[00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:09.240]   press conferences where they talked more about the games than about the TV viewing.
[00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:20.360]   Still that controversy even more flamed about used games on Xbox One. Sony put out that
[00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:26.040]   funny viral video in which the tutorial on how to share games with the PlayStation 4,
[00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:36.440]   which basically involved here. Have a game. We also got the prices $4.99 for the Xbox One.
[00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:40.280]   Not a surprise Paul Thoretta said that's how much it was going to cost for a couple of months.
[00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:46.600]   $3.99, $100 less for the PlayStation 4. That's also not a surprise since it's a comparable device.
[00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:53.000]   You take off Connect which about $100. That makes sense. Is that $100 difference going to make
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:23:01.640]   a difference to buyers come Christmas? Or is the used game issue a big issue? Or is it just a
[00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:07.160]   tempest in a teapot? I don't think it's a tempest in a teapot. I think the jury is really still out
[00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:11.080]   on what will make a difference this holiday season. There's still a long way to go and that's what
[00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:16.360]   Microsoft is telling us. It's a long road to launch. And the fact is there's still
[00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:21.400]   being a cagey on exactly what the details will be for their used game policy. They've
[00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:28.040]   made some inflammatory suggestions. I think a lot of their hard policies will be subject to change.
[00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:33.000]   But to be honest, Sony's announcements weren't, you know, they were received very well at E3.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.720]   There was a standing ovation on the floor of their press conference when they announced this,
[00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:43.160]   which is practically unheard of. That just doesn't happen. But I don't, you know,
[00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:47.480]   what they announced was essentially, yeah, you can buy a game. You can buy a hard copy of a
[00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:51.240]   game. You can give it to somebody else. We won't charge you for that. We're not going to restrict
[00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:55.720]   that. The console is not going to have to check in with the mothership every 24 hours via the
[00:23:55.720 --> 00:24:02.200]   internet, like the Xbox One has been announced to have to do. But then they snuck in a little
[00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:08.200]   something about having to pay for a PlayStation Plus to play multiplayer games online, which was
[00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:12.920]   something they hadn't talked about previously and it hadn't done previously. And then they also
[00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:20.280]   announced that game publishers will be able to set their own policies about how and when or if
[00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:26.520]   you will be charged for playing online or playing a used game or trading a game. So really, their
[00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:31.400]   policy isn't entirely too much different from what Microsoft has. Microsoft's saying that the
[00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:36.360]   publishers get to choose what they use game policy is on their games, even on the Xbox One.
[00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:39.480]   And that's what Sony's saying. They're just saying it from different directions.
[00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:45.320]   That's right. If EA decides none of our games are going to be resellable, it'll be the same on both
[00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:50.200]   platforms. And they could also decide that you may be able to buy a game, buy a hard copy of a game
[00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:56.120]   in a retail store, in which case Sony has announced they won't charge you to play that game. But EA
[00:24:56.120 --> 00:25:02.200]   could then say they will charge you for an online pass to play that hard copy online or once you
[00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:07.480]   download it onto the hard drive of the PS4, which some have suggested all games will need to be
[00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:11.640]   downloaded to the hard drive. And once you do that, it's no longer a physical copy and then the rules
[00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:17.400]   can change. Right. And in fact, isn't this I mean in the next these things last for 10 years,
[00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:24.760]   it's pretty predictable to the next few years. Games on disk are going away, right? Or not?
[00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:30.840]   I think so. I think there will always be a market for games that people want to grab.
[00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:33.800]   There will always be a market for things that you can play without an internet connection.
[00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:39.560]   But as far, the consoles are the bleeding edge for the core gamers who aren't playing on the PC.
[00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:44.360]   And that bleeding edge will always use the latest and greatest technology. I think one of the reasons
[00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:49.160]   we haven't seen too much, this E3 was very exciting because we got a lot of news about a lot of games
[00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:55.640]   that are coming out. And they all seem very advanced and very exciting games like Destiny and Titanfall
[00:25:55.640 --> 00:26:00.680]   are doing really exciting things, merging multiplayer gaming with single player gaming and creating
[00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:06.040]   interesting experiences. We haven't been getting the details for those games until recently because
[00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:10.680]   they were tied directly to what the consoles were doing. The technology built into the consoles,
[00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:17.880]   which has just been announced. So I think it's kind of a double-edged sword. People don't want to,
[00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:21.240]   people say they don't want to be always online, but then they use their always online connected
[00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:28.120]   devices to complain about that. They want to be able to take their console to Grandma's cabin
[00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:32.680]   when they go on vacation. But who really does that? So a lot of the experiences that are coming out
[00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:36.920]   in terms of the games that people play, which at the end of the day, both Microsoft and PlayStation
[00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:43.640]   have made a lot of noise about being a full living room integrated devices with downloadable
[00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:48.680]   movies, integration with Netflix and various other services. But at the end of the day, games
[00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:54.440]   sell consoles and the games that are going to drive people to buy these consoles are the games
[00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:58.520]   that are going to provide the most interesting, innovative experiences. And that is leading towards
[00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:03.720]   the Internet. So I think there's going to be an initial outcry. I think once the policies
[00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:09.720]   sort themselves out in the next few months, they're going to look very similar. I think at the end
[00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:15.080]   of the day, people will buy these consoles, whether they're online or not. That outrage will go away
[00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:23.240]   quickly. Although you got to laugh at Microsoft's fumbling this whole story, people like Don
[00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:30.360]   Matric of Microsoft who said, well, don't worry, just buy an Xbox 360. If you can't get on the line.
[00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:38.520]   It's lovely. Come on, Don. You know, you get the sense looking at Microsoft that everyone who had
[00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:45.960]   any idea how to talk to the public somehow went away. They've really done a very poor job of enunciating
[00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:51.560]   their policies in a way that make them seem palatable. In fact, there was a report, I think it was in
[00:27:51.560 --> 00:28:00.760]   the military times, early this weekend, saying that the Microsoft have single-handedly alienated
[00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:06.920]   the entire US military. Because they're not online. Because you will require an online connection to
[00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:12.520]   play the Xbox One because the Kinect, which as a camera and a microphone, must always also be online.
[00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:17.480]   So theoretically, this thing could be listening in on class of fun. They'll never allow that on
[00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:22.120]   military bases. Yeah. When getting anywhere near a military base. And these guys, you know,
[00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:26.360]   and I've heard people say that military bases, even some forward operating bases,
[00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:30.760]   do have internet connections. And that's fine and fantastic. But you can't rely on that, obviously,
[00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:37.080]   in a compact zone. So these guys get a lot of joy and relaxation from playing their devices.
[00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:42.040]   And when you put restrictions on those that make it difficult for them or even impossible or legal
[00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:46.120]   for them to use it, then you're asking for people to say. I hadn't even thought of that.
[00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:52.280]   I think one of the things people pundits were saying is, well, you know, as much as you hear
[00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:57.240]   the hardcore console gamers talk, they're not who drives the sales here. Is that true?
[00:28:57.240 --> 00:29:02.920]   That's not true now. It certainly hasn't been true for the last eight years. The current
[00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:09.080]   console generation, those consoles were sold first and foremost to gaming. It's gaming. I think
[00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:14.360]   you'll see more and more people who aren't part of the core crowd buying these devices. You know,
[00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:18.840]   I think that the Xbox One has a lot of really cool integrated features for people who enjoy
[00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:21.880]   watching sports on television, who play fantasy football and have that look at it.
[00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:26.040]   Yeah, it looks really great. So I think they're trying to open those consoles up. I mean,
[00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:30.840]   Microsoft has said since day one with the original Xbox, they wanted it to be a Trojan horse. They
[00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:36.440]   wanted it to be a living room device, more than a game device. And slowly, they have been building
[00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:41.880]   it into something that could be reasonably calm bad. And I think the Xbox One really is. It's an
[00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:45.480]   all-in-one solution for practically everything you would want to do from your couch. And that's
[00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:51.000]   fine. But man, they need to first sell this to the core gamers because that's who they're
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:58.360]   evangelists. And PS4 has no living room use. I mean, it is a gaming box and nothing more or
[00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:02.920]   it's fine because I bought the PS3 a lot of it because it had Blu-ray on it.
[00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:07.240]   It was just right. Yeah. I got gaming for free. It was a Blu-ray player.
[00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:13.000]   It was one of the cheapest Blu-ray players. It wasn't a very good one too. The PS4 actually will
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:17.640]   have a lot of the same offerings that the Xbox One will have. You'll be able to watch your movies.
[00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:24.760]   You know, the PlayStation 3's viewing capabilities and movie downloads has been roughly equivalent
[00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:30.840]   to the Xbox 360s. And I think you can expect the PlayStation 4 will also have a similarly robust
[00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:34.040]   living room solution. You have to buy the camera extra if you want it to spy on you in your
[00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:37.880]   private moments. I don't think a lot of people will do that though.
[00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:43.400]   Yeah. In fact, Netflix said the number one device for watching Netflix is a PS3.
[00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:49.080]   In fact, you have to pay money to watch Netflix on an Xbox. Are they going to change that?
[00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:56.120]   I don't see how they would. I don't expect that to happen. You'll still need the Xbox
[00:30:56.120 --> 00:31:00.760]   subscription. Yeah, Xbox Gold. That's awesome. But you'll need to play Station Plus just to play
[00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:05.160]   multiplayer games. And up till now, we haven't heard anything from Microsoft that they will charge
[00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:09.720]   just to play multiplayer games, although I imagine they will consider PlayStation's announcement
[00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:14.520]   to be permission to do that. So as expensive as these are, both are going to require a monthly feed
[00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:19.640]   or really be used as people want to use them. That's right. Who's the winner?
[00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:29.480]   Oh, man. You know, you just, from what, from the point of view of who's getting their message out
[00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:35.080]   and who's generating the most public goodwill, you have to say Sony is the winner right now.
[00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:42.120]   I mean, that standing on the show over the press conference, that was the game for them.
[00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:47.640]   At least today, E3. Still a long road to launch. And like I said, I think most of the policies
[00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:53.000]   wind up being fairly similar at the end of the day. But right now, Sony's got the good will on
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:59.720]   their side. What about Nintendo? Are they, is it over for Nintendo? Are they going back to
[00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:04.520]   being a card company? Well, that's the same question a lot of people were asking at E3.
[00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:09.000]   What about Nintendo? They decided not to have a physical presence at the show this year. They
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:15.080]   did a Nintendo direct from their headquarters in Japan very early on Tuesday. That's a big deal.
[00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:21.400]   Elite not going to E3. That's a big deal. That's a huge deal. And that's, you know, a lot of people
[00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:25.400]   think that that's a mission. They didn't really have a lot to talk about. Although they did announce
[00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:28.920]   some exciting games that got a lot of people excited about the Wii U for the first time since
[00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:34.520]   it was announced. So I don't know about Nintendo. You know, people, people want to count them out
[00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:40.280]   as I think they, they are definitely seeding a certain part of the game to Microsoft and Sony.
[00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:44.440]   I don't think they see themselves as directly competitive competing with those two companies.
[00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:49.240]   But you know, it's still, but they're still competing in terms of they're being only so
[00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:53.560]   many hours in a day. And you know, in the same way that indies compete with the larger game companies,
[00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:58.040]   you know, they're all looking for the same eyeballs and they see an amount of time and the same
[00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:03.640]   attention from people. So I guess their goal is to try and do that a different way that they're
[00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:07.560]   tapping, they're leaning on their core franchises very hard. And I guess their hope is that people
[00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:12.600]   will want to play Mario enough that they will buy that Wii U and buy that new Mario game.
[00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:16.600]   But is anybody buying the Wii U? Is that, is that, do we know how well that's done?
[00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:21.880]   I don't know if, man, how well it's doing, but it's really, there's not a lot of excitement about it.
[00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:28.280]   Why this Super Mario World 3D though, this looks good. It doesn't cost him, doesn't it? It's
[00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:31.560]   just thinking about this thing, though, man. But you're right, there's going to be, it's an
[00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:36.040]   nostalgia play for a lot of people. And then kids will love it, right? Yeah, I mean, at least,
[00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:40.280]   you know, I talked to a lot of indie game developers at E3 and people like to say there's really nobody
[00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:45.800]   doing platform gaming, which is that style of Mario game. Nobody doing platform gaming right now,
[00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:49.880]   except for the indies and Nintendo. And people obviously like that style of game and they like
[00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:54.600]   those characters. You would just, you know, I think a lot of us who are hardcore game fans,
[00:33:54.600 --> 00:34:00.360]   we just wanted to see more from Nintendo. It's been such a beloved company. You know, a lot of
[00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:05.560]   people grew up with the NES and those characters. You just want to see them competing a little bit
[00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:10.760]   more strongly. So a device like the Wii U, it's kind of confusing. It's like Fisher Price, my first
[00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:16.840]   tablet. You know, it's limited in a lot of ways. It doesn't feel cutting edge and the availability
[00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:22.040]   of the games is very limited. I guess when you see a title like Mario Kart 8,
[00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:28.520]   you just feel like maybe they've kind of run out of new ideas or something. I don't know.
[00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:35.160]   But let's now. Okay, so that's the big three or the big two and a half.
[00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:38.920]   Uya had kind of a presence on the show floor as well.
[00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:44.360]   Uya was actually just off this. They were outside. They rented a parking lot. They called it
[00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:49.960]   a park of some sort, especially a parking lot with a tent and a bunch of games.
[00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:54.440]   They were okay. I stand corrected. Uya had a presence in the parking lot.
[00:34:54.440 --> 00:35:01.560]   But it had a presence in the parking lot. But they were there. It's the little game console
[00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:07.240]   that could, you know, there've been some Uya competitors announced. Lots of people are trying
[00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:14.680]   to put forth a cheap console solution tapping into the Android market. It's an interesting thing.
[00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:21.080]   I think it's definitely makes a statement about where these innovations in gaming can come from.
[00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:25.640]   You have a lot of indies, indie development driving that console. And obviously it's relatively
[00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:31.400]   inexpensive. It's not very hard to get your game in that marketplace. And if you buy that console,
[00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:34.600]   you can play lots and lots and lots of games very easily and cheaply.
[00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:41.080]   The Uya, though, honestly, I don't think it's very well done. I don't think it's a very solid
[00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:46.280]   solution. I think it has a long way to go before it's going to be a competitor to the Xbox.
[00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:50.680]   You know where our reviewer, Jeff Needles, liked it was as an XBMC
[00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:59.800]   tool. You can put XBMC on it. And then it's a $99 gaming machine plus, you know, media center.
[00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:03.080]   Original Xbox. It's a cheap media center. Yes, like the original Xbox.
[00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:07.560]   That may be a market. Let's quickly run through games that will let you go. I know
[00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:15.160]   your wife wants to celebrate her birthday. Call of Duty ghosts, infinity word back.
[00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:22.280]   Look good. Is there a dog? There's a dog. You know, it's all everybody's talking about.
[00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:26.440]   I don't know why. Okay. Good. Yeah, it's got a camera on it. You can control. I actually
[00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:33.000]   got my hands on that one. There's a camera on the dog. Can you fight with the dog?
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:36.760]   Can you be the dog? You can be the dog. You know, they weren't really wanted to downplay the
[00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:40.840]   fighting of the dog because apparently the dogs act the actual dog that serve with a special
[00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:46.680]   forces in combat don't. They're not used as weapons. So they wanted to play that down a little bit.
[00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:51.960]   But they also had to kind of juggle the fact that people play games and have certain expectations
[00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:57.320]   whether they're realistic or not. So you do have the option to deploy the dog in certain ways.
[00:36:57.320 --> 00:37:01.800]   But for the most part, it's it's more of a snooping tool. I want to release down.
[00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:09.000]   I'm excited. I'm there's a couple of games that I'm looking forward to. And of course,
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:13.720]   I'm not a hardcore gamer. So I'm probably the wrong guy. But what is that open world where you
[00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:18.520]   can hack almost anything? Watchdogs. Watchdogs looks really cool. And that's now that's not
[00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:22.360]   an exclusive. Is Call of Duty an exclusive? Does anybody have an exclusive?
[00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:28.120]   On current one, a lot of exclusives announced this year. And that's a big differentiator. Isn't
[00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:33.800]   that what probably in the long run is going to make the person to make a gamer decide Xbox or
[00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:39.160]   PlayStation? I feel like everybody's focusing on this used game issue because we don't we can't
[00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:44.520]   argue about which exclusive we want. So the hardware is so simple, similar. It's all x86. I mean,
[00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:48.680]   admittedly, maybe the PlayStation 4 has on paper better specs. But I don't know if that's going to
[00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:54.440]   make a difference. There isn't a lot of differentiation. So you're focusing on these license issues.
[00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:59.160]   Yeah. These rights issues. Yeah. Traditionally, people have decided on one console or another
[00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:03.880]   based on the exclusive in Halo gamers. You know, we'll choose your Xbox people who like resistance.
[00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:09.160]   Well, there is there is a destiny, which is the new one for very Halo like it looked like from
[00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:16.040]   Bungie. Sure. Same team plans to be a multi part series. They say they're planning for an eight-year
[00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:22.600]   life cycle for this game franchise. Big, big, big project from the makers of. You like it? Halo.
[00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:27.560]   I do like it. Yeah, I do like it a lot. I think they are. I think the trick though,
[00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:31.960]   you know, they do what they do. They do it very well. I think the trick with that game is going to
[00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:37.880]   be how well it delivers on some of the next gen promises they've made in terms of the connectivity
[00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:42.360]   some of the merging of the single player with a multiplayer gameplay and how well all that works.
[00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:49.240]   Because, you know, there's no shortage of shooters. There's no shortage of games. This game is going
[00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:54.360]   to sink or swim based on some of those promises. But I like it a lot. I think it looks really good.
[00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:59.400]   It's very exciting. One of the coolest aspects of it is the ability to sort of seamlessly
[00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:04.760]   matchmaking. You can go from playing a single player game to having friends drop in and help
[00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:09.720]   you out and have a co-op experience. And that happens more or less seamlessly and that can
[00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:13.240]   drop in and out at any time. And then you'll enter these public areas where all of a sudden you're
[00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:19.080]   playing an instance where anyone, anyone playing the same game and roughly the same area of the
[00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:24.120]   world can join in and you can all team up against enemies or to accomplish various other things.
[00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:28.440]   I've been a little cagey about the details and I think they wanted to get out this idea that the
[00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:34.200]   game morphs from single player to co-op to multiplayer. And all of the technology, all the matchmaking
[00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:38.840]   is happening behind the scenes. So there's no loading screen. There's no lobby. It just happens.
[00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:44.360]   Right? It looks a little bit like Halo. There's no Master Chief in it. No, no Master Chief.
[00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:50.840]   There's a guy who looks like Russ Pitzer. Apparently. This is Russ's video from Polygon.
[00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:56.840]   Yeah, they tell me they wanted to give the player all of the choice. They didn't want to nail the
[00:39:56.840 --> 00:40:01.480]   player down to being a specific character that they created. They wanted you to be able to build
[00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:05.480]   your own character and make the choices of how he looked and how he played. And I also get the
[00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:10.680]   sense that there was a feeling that the Master Chief character had kind of overwhelmed that franchise.
[00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:16.200]   I think they want to allow the writers and the creators to have more freedom to do different
[00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:21.400]   things. That's fair. Any breakouts that you were surprised to see anything you should,
[00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:25.000]   your want, we want to warn us about? Rise took seven years to make.
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:31.400]   Rise took seven years to make and man, if it isn't a big question mark whether or not that matters.
[00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:34.920]   Yeah, nobody is playing it cares.
[00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:39.880]   Yeah. Nobody is playing it cares. It had a long life cycle. It went through a lot of different
[00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:44.840]   phases. It was originally supposed to be a connect game of sorts. And then they pulled it back and
[00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:49.400]   they made it more connect again. And then they pulled it back again. So I think it was actually,
[00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:51.880]   I'm a smoker. I think it was originally not supposed to be a connect. And then it was
[00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:57.320]   connected and went back and forth. What it looks like now is a weird kind of hybrid between a
[00:40:57.320 --> 00:41:03.080]   connect game and something else. I think a lot of people are calling it a connect on Xbox One
[00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:07.160]   technology demo. I think it looks very, very pretty. I mean, the Crytek, they're the team
[00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:13.240]   behind Far Cry and Crisis, which has been known to make computers cry.
[00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:18.600]   It's going to be very, very pretty, whether or not it's interesting, whether or not it's fun
[00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:24.120]   to play. These are still open questions. Right now it looks like a very fancy technology demo
[00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:27.720]   with a lot of quick time events where you press a button when it tells you to press a button.
[00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:30.680]   Oh, that would be really boring. That would be sad.
[00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:35.400]   It would be sad. Yeah. It would be sad. But when you see a game though, when you see a console
[00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:41.240]   game that's been in development for seven years, it's hard to think that something's good.
[00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:44.360]   Something good is going to come out of that. The connection looks pretty cool. I mean,
[00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:49.160]   you throw things, you kick, you're actually kind of fighting in there and be kind of fun if there
[00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:53.960]   really were something where you could do that. Yeah. And we talked to developers right now and
[00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:59.160]   with the connect being built into the Xbox One, they're going to develop for it.
[00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:02.200]   They got to develop for it. What we're hearing now is that they're going to start integrating
[00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:07.320]   more or less simple things that enhance the experience. Imagine in a splinter sale game,
[00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:10.760]   for example, and this is not something that I know that they're doing, but imagine, for example,
[00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:18.600]   if you could touch your temple and activate your night vision or shake your head or do gestures
[00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:22.840]   like they do, like the soldiers do, like hand gestures to each other and like stop or I see
[00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:27.160]   in there. Yeah. Yeah. Little things like that that they get to layer onto the core experience of playing
[00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:30.680]   a game with the controller that I think would make a big difference. It's bloody holy cow.
[00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:37.160]   Oh, yeah. Lots of next stabbing. Next stabbing is still a big thing in games.
[00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:39.240]   Very popular. Yeah. Very popular this year.
[00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:45.560]   And they call it did a ghost demo. There's a part where you're scaling the outside of a building
[00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:49.320]   like Batman, you know, you're scaling down the outside of a building and there's a dude on a
[00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:54.360]   window washing platform about nine floors down. You can press a button and leap down and stab
[00:42:54.360 --> 00:43:04.840]   up in the neck and it's exciting. Great. To give me one and break out surprise, anything that
[00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:08.440]   people hadn't heard about that you thought is exciting or with paying attention to.
[00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:15.640]   You know, one of the coolest things I saw was Ninja Gaiden Z. It's a Ninja Gaiden.
[00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:20.440]   With zombies? No, and you know, they're may or may not be zombies, but the funny thing about
[00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:26.120]   it is that's a really hard game. People enjoy it because it's hard and a ninja theme. This one
[00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:29.880]   takes it in a little bit different direction. They basically hired the one of the creators of
[00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:35.560]   the Spec Ops game. Spec Ops Align, which is a critically acclaimed game about the horrors of war,
[00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:38.200]   but they hired this guy and they basically said have fun with it. Take the franchise in
[00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:43.000]   whatever direction you want. And he did. And it's kind of silly and over the top and definitely not
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:48.920]   traditional entry in that franchise. So I think if you're looking for something a little light
[00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:53.400]   and fun and exciting and deep, that'll be a good one for a lot of folks. Anything from Blizzard?
[00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:59.800]   Yeah, I didn't see anything around that. That's not weird. They just taken the year off maybe.
[00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:03.320]   They just, you know, they deserve some time off. Well, they had their project Titan,
[00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:07.480]   which was supposed to be their next big thing, but they recently just pulled that back into the
[00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:11.160]   kid. They sent it back to the kitchen, decided they weren't going in the right direction with it
[00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:17.080]   and made it to completely retool. When you see seven years to do rise and you hear stories like
[00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:21.080]   that, you really realize this stuff has gotten harder and harder and more and more expensive
[00:44:21.080 --> 00:44:26.040]   and more. It feels like it's almost at the limit of what these game companies can do.
[00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:31.400]   Well, you get, we're getting into into a place now where you're requiring two and
[00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:36.680]   three hundred person teams and ten to $100 million to create these games. And you're seeing
[00:44:36.680 --> 00:44:42.120]   them still being sort of beat or matched by small, you know, 10 to 50 person teams and making
[00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:46.760]   indie games. Like a lot of the really exciting, ambitious stuff is happening in India right now.
[00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:51.000]   And these triple A teams, they're really scratching their heads. They're really trying to figure out
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:55.160]   what their extra, you know, hundreds of people and extra millions of dollars is actually getting
[00:44:55.160 --> 00:45:00.360]   them in a lot of cases. It's nothing. So I think, I think we're at a point in the industry where,
[00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:03.960]   you know, we really needed to see three with a new technology and to be able to say that you have
[00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:11.000]   these large expensive teams working with this new exciting technology to do outstanding things.
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:14.520]   But at the end of the day, it's a very scary time to make an expensive game.
[00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:17.640]   It's a bad sign when they're making remakes of Castle Wolfenstein.
[00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:23.720]   I think it's a great sign. That's what we really want. That's what we really want.
[00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:28.040]   All right. Hey, Russ, it's been so great having you on. I really appreciate it. We're going to let
[00:45:28.040 --> 00:45:35.080]   you go. Russ Pitts, who is editor at Polygon, Polygon.com, very in depth coverage with a lot of,
[00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:41.480]   a lot of gameplay video from E3. If you want to know what happened, what the big games were,
[00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:45.560]   this is the place to go, the console wars and so forth. And I'm sure as the console wars
[00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:49.960]   develop, we'll talk to you again. Maybe this Christmas time you can help me decide.
[00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:55.320]   Actually, I pre-ordered the Xbox one. I'm getting all that. Yeah. You get the day one edition with
[00:45:55.320 --> 00:45:59.960]   the engraved controllers. Yeah. That'll be nice. Because then I can invite people over and,
[00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:05.320]   you know, it's a great way to get chicks. Yeah. I always, I was in the first day, I'm in the first
[00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:12.280]   day. I'm looking at my Xbox. I have a special controller. Just tell my stapler. All right. Thank
[00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:19.000]   you, Russ. Thank you. Thanks for having me on. Man. You're going to get, but of course we're going
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:22.920]   to get all of them. You're going to get both. But that's a lot of money to see. I have the
[00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:26.920]   theory that, and I should have brought up earlier, but that mobile is still eating away at the
[00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:30.680]   console. Oh, it totally is. Like the little EDC is Apple's now the last platform where you can come
[00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:34.760]   in, stick your phone on the table, grab a Bluetooth controller, airplay it or HDMI to your TV and
[00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:38.680]   start playing games. And that's what'll happen as people will be doing this a lot. Absolutely.
[00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:43.240]   Well, I take photographs. But if you're Microsoft, you're smart because Connect is something unique
[00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:47.640]   and different that can maybe bring that out. And I, they had that and I meant to ask Russ about
[00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:52.440]   this. They didn't show the aluminum room technology, but I love that demo. Yeah. I want to speak
[00:46:52.440 --> 00:46:56.520]   more at Microsoft is also smart because they're not being precious with smart glass. They're
[00:46:56.520 --> 00:47:00.520]   putting it on every platform. So they'll be able to do some of that tablet integration with the
[00:47:00.520 --> 00:47:04.520]   other platform. So I'm not going to be honest. That's why I got the Xbox one because I'm more
[00:47:04.520 --> 00:47:09.800]   interested in the TV integration, the smart glass, second screen stuff. I like the NFL with the
[00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:15.480]   with the stats on the side. I think for me that, you know, the games I'm going to play. It's, you
[00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:20.040]   know, a few times. Yeah. So it makes more sense to have a console that can do more. But you
[00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:24.440]   get all of them. And in that case, Microsoft has won the perception racket because as Russ
[00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:28.920]   pointed out, they're really pretty much identical in terms of that. Yeah, absolutely. And they,
[00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:33.240]   like, I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm going to
[00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:38.840]   do that. I'm going to be able to do that. I'm going to be able to do that. I'm going to be
[00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:45.480]   able to do that. I'm going to be able to do that. I'm going to be able to do that. I'm going to
[00:47:45.480 --> 00:47:50.360]   be able to do that. I'm going to be able to do that. I'm going to be able to do that.
[00:47:50.360 --> 00:47:55.640]   I'm going to be able to do that. I'm going to be able to do that. I'm going to be able to do
[00:47:55.640 --> 00:48:01.640]   the future. It is the Mac Pro. It's going to look so nice. Not overkill it all. No,
[00:48:01.640 --> 00:48:06.040]   it's going to look so nice next to my big screen TV. It can finally make iTunes work, you know,
[00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:13.720]   it's not working silent. It's going to be that's the this is the future. And only 5000. Well,
[00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:18.600]   we don't know what the money will talk about WWDC next. You're watching this week in tech.
[00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:23.880]   Thanks to a Trey Radcliffe and to Russ Pitts for joining us. Sticking around Dieterbone from
[00:48:23.880 --> 00:48:28.760]   the Verge, our good friend Renee Ritchie from iMore.com. Lots more to talk about.
[00:48:28.760 --> 00:48:34.280]   But first, let's take a break and talk about one of our sponsors with a unique product.
[00:48:34.280 --> 00:48:41.240]   It's free, free free, like it's just free. And really the trick on this, and I think one of the
[00:48:41.240 --> 00:48:48.840]   reasons they're making it free is because it is hard to talk about what it does. If you've ever,
[00:48:49.800 --> 00:48:55.880]   if you're in a big business where you know about big business intelligence, you probably have this
[00:48:55.880 --> 00:49:00.920]   idea that, you know, in big, big, big business, they have big data. They have huge data sets that
[00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:05.800]   they can parse, they can go through, they can predict the future. It's really changed the way
[00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:10.440]   business is done in the US. Wouldn't it be cool to have that kind of business intelligence for
[00:49:10.440 --> 00:49:16.200]   you, for your podcast, for your small business, for your store? Well, some all is bringing that
[00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:25.080]   exact idea down to earth, free right now, S-U-M-A-L-L.com. We've been using it at Twitter, and it really
[00:49:25.080 --> 00:49:34.440]   is incredibly useful for us. We can tie in all the services we use. So Google+ Twitter, Facebook,
[00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:41.480]   Tumblr, Instagram, they just added Amazon, actually, that's been there a while, MailChimp, AdSense,
[00:49:41.480 --> 00:49:48.680]   SendGrid, Basecamp Bitly, WordPress, Constant Contact, they've got Amazon paper. They're
[00:49:48.680 --> 00:49:52.600]   getting through the API, they're getting information from all of these services,
[00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:57.720]   and then giving you a beautiful dashboard that shows you things like, well, we're interested,
[00:49:57.720 --> 00:50:04.680]   for instance, when we plug our t-shirt on the show, does it increase t-shirt sales? When we do it on
[00:50:04.680 --> 00:50:08.920]   Twitter, what's the relationship between that, the show and t-shirt? All of this stuff is a
[00:50:08.920 --> 00:50:15.320]   really impressive example of big data that you can put to work for yourself right now.
[00:50:15.320 --> 00:50:19.240]   So with some all, you go to one place, you can see what's happening across your business.
[00:50:19.240 --> 00:50:25.240]   Whatever business you're in, I think you're going to be very interested in this. And it is free.
[00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:30.360]   They've added an export and spreadsheet view that you could put projections into email.
[00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:35.800]   In fact, they're adding features all the time, a dozen new features. Some all just passed a half
[00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:41.400]   trillion social impressions tracked. They're sucking all of that data in. They've grown 30%
[00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:45.960]   in the last few weeks. I think people are starting to learn about some all. I hope you're learning
[00:50:45.960 --> 00:50:53.080]   about some all, and I hope you'll give it a try right now. Go to sumall.com, click try some all,
[00:50:53.080 --> 00:50:59.720]   create an account, and I got to say it is free free. It's not freemium. You will see some pricing.
[00:50:59.720 --> 00:51:04.600]   I think there's still some pricing on the website. That's just maybe some idea of what it might
[00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:12.200]   cost someday. For right now, you don't even give them a credit card. I don't even know how they're
[00:51:12.200 --> 00:51:18.200]   paying for this ad. It's free. And it's great. And I just think, actually, it's a good friend,
[00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:24.120]   Anthony Castellena, who was, I'm sorry, not Anthony Castellena, Dane, who was at the start of
[00:51:24.120 --> 00:51:29.240]   Squarespace. And he's just, I think he just believes in this. And he just figures,
[00:51:29.240 --> 00:51:35.080]   we'll figure it out. We'll make it happen. Are you YouTube channel chat? You should be using this.
[00:51:35.080 --> 00:51:39.640]   Get your YouTube metrics together with your social media campaigns to see what works.
[00:51:39.640 --> 00:51:46.040]   Wouldn't you like to know when it's best to tweet about a new video, to correlate Google+
[00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:50.360]   Facebook, Twitter, Instagram to your YouTube video views? You can do all of that.
[00:51:50.360 --> 00:51:56.040]   And you can, yeah, the best part about it is that all of those services are plugged in. I don't use
[00:51:56.040 --> 00:52:01.800]   just one service. I might have analytics on something, but not everything. And so it's really nice that
[00:52:01.800 --> 00:52:08.440]   everything can be plugged into the panel. I was going to log in and show you, but I don't
[00:52:08.440 --> 00:52:15.320]   know if it's sanitized or stuff in there we might know. So, I can show you this graph.
[00:52:15.320 --> 00:52:20.040]   There you go. That's it. Wouldn't you like to know how that happened? There you go.
[00:52:20.040 --> 00:52:25.720]   That's what we don't want to show you. So, that's when we introduce nudity on the channel.
[00:52:25.720 --> 00:52:28.520]   Right. Yeah. You can see the jump stick. The jump.
[00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:33.800]   Amazing. They do not resell your data. Your data is secure. The data is private.
[00:52:33.800 --> 00:52:37.080]   It is a great service. And I just, all I can say is try it.
[00:52:37.080 --> 00:52:43.320]   Sumall, S-U-M-A-L-L.com, which Dane all the best because I think he's really doing great.
[00:52:43.320 --> 00:52:47.000]   No, there will be no nudity on this show. That's my promise to you.
[00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:52.040]   I was looking forward. I was fully closed.
[00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:55.560]   At all times. Bit of a bid and switch now. I make no promises. I got a bag.
[00:52:55.560 --> 00:53:03.240]   I got a couple of things from Apple. Look at this. So, WWDC was on Monday. Renee, you were there.
[00:53:03.240 --> 00:53:09.800]   Deeter, did you go? I was not there. You looked across the bay and you saw all the people flocking
[00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:15.320]   into Moscone. There is the hall. What do you think that is? If I didn't show you a logo.
[00:53:15.320 --> 00:53:23.080]   2010. Yeah. Or it could be a freezer thing. It's got an apple at the top and an apple at the bottom.
[00:53:23.080 --> 00:53:31.080]   And on the back, this is the new airport extreme with 802.11ac. Why did I buy this? No one knows.
[00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:32.680]   Because I could. You can't wait for AD.
[00:53:32.680 --> 00:53:37.000]   Yeah, because that's going to be the future. Why is it a little bit sour?
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:40.280]   They say it because of the antennas. But you know what's interesting in here.
[00:53:40.920 --> 00:53:46.200]   I fix it. Did a tear down. I should show the tear down because there's a there's like a big gap in
[00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:52.120]   the middle where you put your hard drive. So, it's this would be the same unit as the time capsule
[00:53:52.120 --> 00:53:56.680]   time capsule unit. But they put a hard drive in it. What I wasn't clear about didn't look like
[00:53:56.680 --> 00:54:00.840]   there was a SATA connector. Is there a way I can connect on hard drive in there? Or do I have to
[00:54:00.840 --> 00:54:04.760]   buy it from my Apple? I have to buy it. There wasn't a SATA connector on there. They didn't know if
[00:54:04.760 --> 00:54:08.840]   it would be easy to solder one on. Last time. Maybe that's the thing to do. Yeah. No SATA
[00:54:08.840 --> 00:54:13.080]   connector. But if you how are you with the soldering? How do you feel with the soldering?
[00:54:13.080 --> 00:54:19.320]   And then I was really pleased. So that came today. And then I was really pleased to see this also.
[00:54:19.320 --> 00:54:25.160]   We sent somebody over to the Apple store. And we're very excited about what we got here.
[00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:31.000]   This is something a lot of us professional users have been waiting for. The new Mac Pro is here.
[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:38.200]   Look at that. You see the cooling? It goes right to the top. It comes down right through the bottom.
[00:54:38.760 --> 00:54:43.480]   Actually, this is I may have to make this up. This is not. It's a bunch of gaffers tape.
[00:54:43.480 --> 00:54:48.200]   But I had to make it up because I when I think you don't get right away with the pictures of the
[00:54:48.200 --> 00:54:53.000]   Mac Pro is its dimensions. This is roughly true to dimensions. That's the scale. It's almost a scale.
[00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:57.000]   It's about it's about this much off. It's what happened to it. So that is pretty amazing.
[00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:00.760]   It is they had some on display outside the main hallway of the keynote. And it is mind
[00:55:00.760 --> 00:55:05.960]   numbingly small compared to the old generation tank of a Mac Pro. And inside here you're going
[00:55:05.960 --> 00:55:10.280]   to have it. It's not clear exactly which Xeon whether it be a Haswell or an older Ivy Bridge
[00:55:10.280 --> 00:55:17.240]   Xeon. You're going to have soldered in SSD drives running on the PCI 3 bus.
[00:55:17.240 --> 00:55:23.080]   You're going to have sticks of RAM. The only upgradeable piece would be to take out the old
[00:55:23.080 --> 00:55:28.520]   RAM and put in very expensive higher density RAM. And two video cards also soldered out of the
[00:55:28.520 --> 00:55:34.920]   motherboard. It is not upgradeable. It is. It is what it is. That's why I call it the world's most
[00:55:34.920 --> 00:55:38.920]   expensive home theater PC. I mean that's what they've been doing. They did the MacBook Air like that.
[00:55:38.920 --> 00:55:42.200]   Everyone freaked out when the unibody Mac books went to no battery. And then the MacBook Air was
[00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:47.320]   like that. And the iMac was like that. But the difference is that this is a professional grade
[00:55:47.320 --> 00:55:55.080]   computer. Not a consumer grade. Zero upgrade. So it's upgradeable by the Thunderbolt. But you
[00:55:55.080 --> 00:55:58.360]   have this beautiful design and then you have all these things hanging off which is terrible.
[00:55:58.920 --> 00:56:04.200]   Six times four or six times six thirty six thirty six. Thirty six. Yeah. You know I thought when
[00:56:04.200 --> 00:56:10.440]   Phil Schiller said can't innovate my ass. Yes. After he showed this he said can't innovate my
[00:56:10.440 --> 00:56:17.800]   ass. I thought that actually showed some sensitivity to all of the articles saying you know Apple's
[00:56:17.800 --> 00:56:24.360]   over it's can't innovate anymore. And if he's putting this forward as what Apple sees as great
[00:56:24.360 --> 00:56:32.920]   innovation the future. They can't innovate. Well I mean there this is a failure. Well hang on I
[00:56:32.920 --> 00:56:36.360]   wouldn't say it's a failure. People are gonna we'll see what happens when it goes to sell. First of
[00:56:36.360 --> 00:56:40.040]   all we gotta see I mean if it's fifteen hundred bucks maybe it's four thousand dollars if it's a
[00:56:40.040 --> 00:56:45.960]   penny. And the market for this is completely wrong. What a pro wanted was a new cheese grater with his
[00:56:45.960 --> 00:56:50.840]   new Z on chip in it and a Thunderbolt port. So that's what the pro one. They don't look at this.
[00:56:50.840 --> 00:56:54.680]   It's under their desk. Do you think Apple cares about making money off of that? Is it it's more
[00:56:54.680 --> 00:56:57.720]   it's like a halo product. It's like oh we can see what they can do. It's like Christ there's
[00:56:57.720 --> 00:57:01.400]   Lamborghini. The problem with can't innovate my ass is Neil I put up an article on the Verge is
[00:57:01.400 --> 00:57:05.800]   that nobody was questioning their ability to make us a computer right. Yeah. They can make wild looking
[00:57:05.800 --> 00:57:12.120]   computers is like the best of us. This to me reminds me everybody mentioned the cube. Yes.
[00:57:12.120 --> 00:57:19.800]   Where does faders helmet? Or so the cube came out when what year was the cube 2000. Yeah.
[00:57:20.760 --> 00:57:25.800]   It was it was under John Scully. It was not a John's product. I think I think I think John's
[00:57:25.800 --> 00:57:29.640]   right. You know yeah he did the introduction. Okay. About how beautiful and soundless it was.
[00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:36.680]   Yeah and cracked. Yes. 2000. I think it's hardly. Well that's why this is extruded aluminum. But
[00:57:36.680 --> 00:57:39.960]   this is I mean this is a very specific product. It's not for the guy who wants the eight drive
[00:57:39.960 --> 00:57:42.680]   base because that's the Dell you can go to Dell and outside a computer with eight drive
[00:57:42.680 --> 00:57:45.880]   base. Our photographer and videographer took one look at this and saw if he could fit it in his
[00:57:45.880 --> 00:57:50.200]   backpack to take with him from hotel to hotel is he. Well that's now is his photo. John's.
[00:57:50.200 --> 00:57:53.640]   Oh that's an interesting use. Of course doesn't have enough storage to make it really worth while
[00:57:53.640 --> 00:57:59.160]   you're gonna have to buy a two thousand dollar very heavy. Ray to Ray Thunderbolt to Ray to Ray.
[00:57:59.160 --> 00:58:01.320]   We're just throwing everything in the cloud. Well that's all free now anyway.
[00:58:01.320 --> 00:58:07.880]   I just I think this is a beautiful product. I will buy one because I'm an idiot. But I don't
[00:58:07.880 --> 00:58:12.680]   think this is what the pros wanted at all. Well they showed Pixar they had a lunch with Pixar
[00:58:12.680 --> 00:58:15.960]   and Pixar was showing what they're doing with them. So I think it's just incredibly narrow.
[00:58:15.960 --> 00:58:19.240]   It's not what all pros wanted. It's an incredibly narrowed product again like their other.
[00:58:19.240 --> 00:58:25.000]   It's it's pros humor more. It's like final it's the final cut pro of Mac pros. I mean that
[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:29.080]   enough money is spent and they'll make a great home theater PC. It'll look fantastic.
[00:58:29.080 --> 00:58:33.080]   Look great. I'll find your living room shelf. I if I were pro I would be concerned about the
[00:58:33.080 --> 00:58:37.480]   GPUs. I mean if I if you want to use the crunch video fine but I mean it seems like you know
[00:58:37.480 --> 00:58:43.640]   soldered on non-gradable GPUs. Well not only that it's AMD not Nvidia. No option to choose.
[00:58:43.640 --> 00:58:46.440]   And they're not their 3D oriented not gaming oriented. Right.
[00:58:46.440 --> 00:58:52.760]   I think this is a beautiful product with no market at all. And it really makes me it frankly
[00:58:52.760 --> 00:58:58.520]   makes me call into question Apple's ability to see their market. Or it's Apple's willingness to
[00:58:58.520 --> 00:59:02.280]   shape their market. Like they want to be like they got rid of the X-serve and people are wondering
[00:59:02.280 --> 00:59:06.520]   they let the Mac Pro flounder. They replaced they did not replace the X-serve. No you got a Mac mini
[00:59:06.520 --> 00:59:11.240]   with running almost 10 server. This is if this is rock-mountable I don't know what your racks look like.
[00:59:11.240 --> 00:59:15.640]   No this is like almost like the Matrix we have to sell little computers on a table.
[00:59:15.640 --> 00:59:23.320]   Yeah they got this they they if I'm a pro I think what the real risk is that a lot of professional
[00:59:23.320 --> 00:59:28.920]   users are either they got two choices now Hackintosh or Windows. This is not Alex Lindsey's Mac Pro.
[00:59:28.920 --> 00:59:32.920]   Well I'd love to know we haven't been able to get Alex Lindsey to ask him about it.
[00:59:32.920 --> 00:59:37.880]   And you know Alex he'll buy five of them. Yes he buys everything. But I think in the long run I
[00:59:37.880 --> 00:59:43.320]   just don't I think this is a big mistake and and if pros and I know pros have been very concerned
[00:59:43.320 --> 00:59:48.840]   about it. I wonder what their responses to this. And OS what they were looking for.
[00:59:48.840 --> 00:59:55.080]   OS X and OS X server Mavericks has some really interesting stuff for server side computing
[00:59:55.080 --> 01:00:00.360]   everything from you know Xcode pushing out apps to how it handles data in general and running it on
[01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:04.760]   this will be interesting because it's not that big server formation. Right they don't have one.
[01:00:04.760 --> 01:00:08.280]   No Mac mini is they don't make raids anymore they don't do any of that stuff.
[01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:13.320]   I mean let's be honest is one's the last time that a Mac Pro has had an appreciable difference
[01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:19.400]   on Apple's bottom line. Like no I understand but but but I think there's a larger issue of
[01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:26.680]   reputation. Remember that most of the people who work at Apple are pro users.
[01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:31.800]   What are they going to use they get they're going to use this. They're going to use this.
[01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:36.280]   The old the old one was like an escalate. You know I think I used this before on Mac break.
[01:00:36.280 --> 01:00:40.040]   You threw all your junk in the back and it was giant and roomy and your whole family there.
[01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:44.040]   And this is more like that that Lamborghini the top line of the car that you know there's no room
[01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:47.240]   for kids anymore but it goes really really fast. And then you need to you need to tow your motor
[01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:50.920]   home behind it because are you peripherals plugging in. It's not going to go very far.
[01:00:50.920 --> 01:00:55.720]   And I've seen pros I've seen pros very concerned because Apple's forcing a move to OpenCL and
[01:00:55.720 --> 01:01:00.040]   and there's no CUDA support because there's no Nvidia in here a lot of pros want to use CUDA.
[01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:03.400]   Feel it OpenCL is not as mature as it ought to be. Absolutely but also means that Apple can go
[01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:08.680]   back and forth on video cars that happen to worry about supporting one vendor to do you think they'll
[01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:12.200]   do an Nvidia version of this. They have I mean they've gone from generation to generation switching
[01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:17.720]   cards before. So then this is not upgradable. So you know if you're buying this you're buying AMD.
[01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:20.600]   And then you're handing it off to the next guy and you're buying the new one. Right.
[01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:28.280]   Right. The thermal core is great. I love it. And this is also a way to attempt technology is
[01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:31.400]   going to filter down to the rest of their products which is not something unprecedented. I mean the
[01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:35.560]   MacBook Air the first one was horribly flawed but eventually it led to the one Deeter is using
[01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:39.640]   that's fantastic. And those technologies provided the MacBook Pro and all their other technology.
[01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:45.320]   All right. So they announced the new MacBook Airs as well. Two of them an 11 inch and a 13 inch
[01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:49.080]   using the new has well that's pretty much the difference. It's using the fourth generation
[01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:52.840]   Intel processor which gives the microphone. Pardon me. Second microphone.
[01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:58.520]   And and the array mics that the retina made famous. Right. Which I've never really noticed.
[01:01:58.520 --> 01:02:08.600]   Okay. I thought interesting that they claim battery life on the 11 inch of nine hours and 12
[01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:12.360]   hours in the 13 under mountain line not even under Mavericks yet. Yeah. Are you sure about that?
[01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:16.680]   Yeah. Definitely. That was one that are selling today. Yeah. So when I bought I'll get one tomorrow.
[01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:21.320]   I was disappointed because I was really hoping for a new retina MacBook. Yeah.
[01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:25.400]   Maybe a thinner 13 inch. I don't care. I don't care about his battery life.
[01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:30.520]   I'm getting the 13. I'm super excited about the battery life. This thing maybe gets me two hours.
[01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:37.480]   Yeah. It's two years old. I would I think that like the the retina MacBook now I think the performance
[01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:43.640]   still isn't where I'd like to be. Right. So why would I want that here? You know I want just just
[01:02:43.640 --> 01:02:47.320]   make it last forever. Once you get written a hashed out then you can bring it down to here. But
[01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:52.840]   you know 12 hour battery life if I can realistically they say 12 I can realistically get eight
[01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:55.960]   I'll be in cloud nine and with Mavericks are saying they're getting more than that which is
[01:02:55.960 --> 01:03:01.960]   nice because it has all that special nap power nap features and app naps. Yeah. Yeah. App nap and
[01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:07.960]   the the coagulation. No, it's not a coalescing the coalescing. Yeah. Which is not you know it's not a
[01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:12.120]   developer feature. It's not a front facing user feature but it's huge feature. Absolutely. It's
[01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:16.360]   something that just works in the background. Which apple pioneered with app with power nap
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:21.880]   and I'm curious what's new in the new coalescing features. But this does and this is what has
[01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:25.960]   well supposedly supports and hardware as well. It's a big issue in all mobile devices and I
[01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:30.360]   guess on a portable like a laptop too. Which is that you know I know on these Android funds are
[01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:36.200]   waking up all the time when even when the screen's off and that just kills your battery life.
[01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:40.920]   First thing I do on an Android phone now is disable Facebook because Facebook will call home
[01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:44.200]   every five minutes. And that's what they announced for iOS too is that they're going to intelligently
[01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:47.400]   do all the multitasking. And it was very interesting because they could have pissed off a lot of
[01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:51.400]   developers by saying we're taking over multitasking. Don't you worry about it. But they said you know
[01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:55.080]   developers love server side smart. So we're going to wait. We're going to see if you have a good
[01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:58.600]   signal will do stuff. If something is waking the GPS and other people want it will and they're
[01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:02.680]   doing the same thing with OS 10 as an in with iOS and that is just putting everything into
[01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:06.920]   the smallest profile they possibly can. Great. It's a great opportunity. And it's the way it
[01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:10.840]   should be and Microsoft's been doing this too with Windows 8 that we play catch up and they now have
[01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:16.440]   that coalescing event coalescing feature in Windows 8. And it's part of its hardware support too.
[01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:20.040]   Mavericks. What do you think of the name? How do you like that?
[01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:26.280]   Drives me crazy that it's plural. Come on. I get one Maverick. I guess I get that it fits the
[01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:31.080]   beach but just pick a singular because it's a singular beach. Right. Pick Malibu. There you go.
[01:04:31.080 --> 01:04:37.160]   Except that was a car. So they're going to go to actually there were a few good lines and Craig
[01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:41.640]   Federighi got most of them off. He was he was the star of this so much improved. Great. Yeah.
[01:04:41.640 --> 01:04:46.600]   Really fun. Looked good was wearing a royal blue shirt which I thought was interesting.
[01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:50.280]   Got his hair supply line off. Officially nobody at Apple can tuck their shirts in anymore.
[01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:53.560]   Yeah. They're all doing this is the new look. No more turtlenecks. We're all wearing untucked
[01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:58.840]   shirts. Right. By the way, just want to show you my shirt tails and and and do you do it. Yeah.
[01:04:58.840 --> 01:05:03.640]   You know, we're such fashion hipsters. We just knew that that was the future.
[01:05:04.440 --> 01:05:07.720]   People are going to say we're in the bag for Apple. Yeah. Tuck our shirts. I wish we could
[01:05:07.720 --> 01:05:12.840]   afford a better shirt. We don't tuck in. There they there they go. There's Tim Cook. There's Craig
[01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:16.600]   untucked shirts. But I do like the royal blue. I think that's nice. And from last year to this
[01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:20.520]   year, I mean, he was like, I feel like I feel like Joan Rivers on the red carpet. Yeah.
[01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:26.040]   Wearing royal blue. That's fabulous. Don't take a bono. But he did. No, I was going to get it.
[01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:30.200]   I forgot what his good line was. He did get a couple of good lines off. He did. He said,
[01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:34.040]   we're not going to delay. Oh, I was 10 because we've run out of big cats. Yeah. And this was,
[01:05:34.040 --> 01:05:36.280]   we were all wondering what the hell they're going to name it. And then he said, it was going to be
[01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:40.200]   called sea lion. Yeah. That was funny too. That was good. And I really liked the developers who
[01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:43.800]   applauded. Well, they were all tweeting the day before because they saw the picture of the wave
[01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:46.920]   with the 10 and like, Oh, what are they going to call it? Sea lion. And then he played right into
[01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:51.800]   that. Yeah. That's that actually was very funny. Mavericks. They looks like they're going to name
[01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:56.120]   it after California place names. Maybe beaches. We don't know. Well, it's going to be place names
[01:05:56.120 --> 01:05:59.000]   because people have already talked about. Well, their whole their whole thing now is designed in
[01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:03.880]   California. We got that really good feel good video about being in California. So they're really,
[01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:09.400]   like, that's their response to, I don't know, the sort of like patriotism, I guess, to China
[01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:14.280]   factories to tax on. They still made it. China. Well, don't get except for the Mac Pro. Yeah,
[01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:17.800]   we're going to make a dozen of those a week in everyone that we owe buys are going to make
[01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:23.880]   in Texas. Yeah. All of Leo's Mac Pros will be made in Texas. Assembled. Not a symbol. Sorry.
[01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:28.680]   Assembled in Texas. Productized. So, you know, but I guess California is a good, a good name again.
[01:06:29.240 --> 01:06:35.240]   Yosemite big. Yeah, Yosemite would be good big sir. But Mavericks. Do you think that they were
[01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:39.000]   kind of playing on the idea that we're Mavericks? Here's to the crazy ones.
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:43.480]   He's got so many Sarah Palin jokes. We're just crazy.
[01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:46.760]   It's a top gun, you know, need for speed. Mavericks. Wild.
[01:06:46.760 --> 01:06:49.720]   Oh, it's 10.10. Goose man.
[01:06:49.720 --> 01:06:56.120]   The funny thing is I'm I should be really excited about Mavericks. I'm excited about the
[01:06:56.120 --> 01:06:59.640]   improved in battery life multiple monitors. Multiple monitor supports that
[01:06:59.640 --> 01:07:03.720]   the no improved notification stuff. But we these we're in a mature era.
[01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:09.000]   You're saying there's nothing exciting and stitch. Well, there's some stuff like like a tabbed finder
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:13.880]   and tags. It's so interesting that on iOS, they're like don't pay attention to file system and
[01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:17.320]   none of the Mac like well, we're going to throw more features at you that are that apply to it.
[01:07:17.320 --> 01:07:20.760]   And some of them like like tags. Everybody got really excited about tags. And I was really
[01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:24.600]   confused because they had it before they're called labels. Same thing. There's more of them.
[01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:26.360]   Now there's more of them. You're not limited to them.
[01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:32.360]   And what I was actually kind of happy was that the iOSification didn't progress further.
[01:07:32.360 --> 01:07:34.840]   I was a little worried that we were going to look more and more like iOS.
[01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:39.240]   Well, it didn't. It did a little with the idea of putting apps to sleep more aggressively
[01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:41.480]   when they're in the background. That's right. That's a little bit of.
[01:07:41.480 --> 01:07:47.160]   But you know, but it should be transparent to you. And I think every every desktop's doing this now.
[01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:51.480]   I think what is doing is they did add apps. They have finally iBooks is on the Mac, which is great.
[01:07:51.480 --> 01:07:55.480]   Maps is an app on the Mac. That's just, you know, that's the way it should be. I don't know.
[01:07:55.480 --> 01:08:00.600]   In fact, it's funny. Well, they did it. I was like, oh, you don't rumor that people didn't want
[01:08:00.600 --> 01:08:05.480]   iBooks on the Mac for a while. Oh, the publishers do know that some people in Apple didn't want it.
[01:08:05.480 --> 01:08:08.760]   Hun the Mac for a while. Why not? Because it's not a reading device.
[01:08:08.760 --> 01:08:11.560]   You read on the iPad. Yeah. Well, that's a little bit.
[01:08:11.560 --> 01:08:17.720]   Now it's a whole new Apple, Leo. Pure. So why can they get iWork to be amazing in a web browser,
[01:08:17.720 --> 01:08:22.280]   but they can't get Apple Maps. Why does that have to be an app instead of a website?
[01:08:22.280 --> 01:08:25.800]   I think that with maps, they should get like one thing as right as they can before they move on.
[01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:32.920]   For them to push maps further. iCloud keychain. This is a, you know, a product that's going to
[01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:37.640]   Sherlock one password and it'll take the bottom. It'll take like the, like, I already will take
[01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:41.800]   the majority of users, but not the high end user. Is it this yet another feature that they kind of
[01:08:41.800 --> 01:08:46.520]   had before? They did. They just surfaced it better. Yeah, because you could always do pass. You know,
[01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:51.640]   keychain would store the passwords encrypted. They would generate passwords if you knew how to get
[01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:55.560]   to it, which was, wasn't obvious. It'll do credit cards now as well. It's all the other faces in the
[01:08:55.560 --> 01:08:59.000]   browser. Yeah. So it'll automatically fill in passwords and credit card numbers. Again,
[01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:02.520]   this is from my mom. My mom would never use one password. She'd never use Pandora, but she'll use
[01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:07.960]   iRadio. She'll use keychains. And it does go to iOS. So if you're an Apple, you know, family,
[01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:12.040]   Apple house, you'll be comfortable with this. It won't be a platform. One platform and one browser,
[01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:17.480]   you are fine. They fixed multiple displays, which were very broken. If you go full screen on the
[01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:23.000]   on Mountain Lion, the second. It goes off. Second displays is linen. It's linen. How nice.
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.240]   And they couldn't, they had to, because they got rid of the linen. So they'd be nothing there.
[01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:30.600]   So they had to fix multiple displays. So now it's actually going to have, in fact,
[01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:33.960]   you can even have a menu bar on all your money. And the doc can come up on all. And I don't know
[01:09:33.960 --> 01:09:38.200]   how you guys work, but most of us have one computer and two, at least two cinema displays.
[01:09:38.200 --> 01:09:42.520]   And they were almost useless for full screen apps before. And now, everyone is just drooling
[01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:48.840]   over that. And I love this idea. If you use AirPlay, one of your screens can be your big screen TV.
[01:09:48.840 --> 01:09:54.520]   Yeah, I am super pumped for that. My office is set up. I got my laptop, my monitor, and then
[01:09:54.520 --> 01:09:58.600]   we've got like a TV that's got, you know, they're for like playing an Xbox or I've got an Apple
[01:09:58.600 --> 01:10:04.200]   TV hooked up to it. And I'm just throwing a Tweet deck on that full screen. It's like a social
[01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:07.640]   feed or a dashboard. Looking forward to it. But some all on it or something. And then that way,
[01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:12.600]   it's always going. In fact, there's a great app that they, that was a panic who made that the
[01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:17.320]   dashboard. Yeah, absolutely. That would be great on that. Yeah, it's almost as if they knew.
[01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:23.720]   What is the name of that status board? Status board. Yeah. A little little price is like 20 bucks.
[01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:29.000]   But the idea is you can put modules in for any kind of information. Imagine putting your status
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:32.680]   board on your big screen TV and you're sitting there or I'm watching Game of Thrones. And I could
[01:10:32.680 --> 01:10:37.240]   finally figure out what the leaf is going on. Who is that? What is that?
[01:10:37.240 --> 01:10:41.480]   What is that? What is that? What are they? What more importantly, why are you spending time
[01:10:41.480 --> 01:10:46.440]   learning who that character is because they're going to die in the next. Yeah. Shh. No, I guess
[01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:53.400]   we can say now because it's over. Yeah. But see, notifications. You can actual notifications on
[01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:59.400]   OS 10, but not on iOS. So does the point notifications you can respond to? Yes. So what's the story here?
[01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:03.960]   Is it just apps that have iOS and then they get mirrored to the Mac or like websites
[01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:08.200]   can send you notifications? Yeah, websites. Just kind of like Chrome notifications. Yeah. Okay.
[01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:14.920]   Yeah. And you can respond. You can tweet back. Absolutely. I want that so badly on iOS.
[01:11:14.920 --> 01:11:20.280]   No. No, it can't have it. No, it can't have it. Band when you're. No. Sorry. You're out of luck.
[01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:23.560]   You're not even going to another event. No. Now you said that behind the scenes,
[01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:28.200]   there's some OS 10 server stuff. Some really cool stuff if you're a programmer.
[01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:32.600]   As developer tools allow you to work in a team. Yeah. Kind of agile, agile development.
[01:11:32.600 --> 01:11:37.240]   Oh, that's pretty cool. I'm not sure what is NDA and what is not NDA, but the stuff that they
[01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:41.720]   were showing off was really, really compelling. Yeah. We know what they're charging for the
[01:11:41.720 --> 01:11:46.440]   upgrade. We don't know yet. No. No. It better be 20 bucks. It could be or free or whatever. Mine
[01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:49.640]   will be free. The only thing that I wish they do is they would they take it out of the Mac
[01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:53.800]   app stores that developers with real apps don't have to compete with Mountain Line or or Mavericks
[01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:58.360]   in the best seller list. You know who took their app out of the app store I was told today?
[01:11:58.360 --> 01:12:02.440]   Was that Adobe Lightroom? Really? Well, they were going to face a real problem because they have a
[01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:07.640]   new version of Lightroom coming out and well, how do there's no way to do this in the app store?
[01:12:07.640 --> 01:12:11.640]   I'm not sure confirm if this is true, but I saw somebody in the chat room. I don't know how
[01:12:11.640 --> 01:12:16.760]   that problem too in the app store, Mavericks. What do you do? You can't. There's no upgrade path.
[01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:22.920]   So if you're Lightroom and you've got a major upgrade, you either just give it away to a,
[01:12:22.920 --> 01:12:29.320]   which is why, by the way, Adobe, I bought Lightroom in the app store. So they're going to close that
[01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:34.200]   off for me or you have to charge them full prices if it's a whole new app.
[01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:39.960]   So is Apple willfully trying to change the way the market works by not offering this?
[01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:47.800]   I can't imagine they didn't think of this use case, but it seems so obvious that it's not just
[01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:52.360]   going to happen overnight and that people need to get paid upgrades. Yeah, absolutely. Where
[01:12:52.360 --> 01:12:59.400]   tell me Renee, I'm a metal office. It's commodified software. I mean, they're pushing prices so low
[01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:03.000]   that they believe the value will be in charging for a second app or not, you know, not charging
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:08.680]   for updates and providing value. By the way, I would love to have paid upgrades. I think the
[01:13:08.680 --> 01:13:12.280]   developers need it. I want developers to make as much money as possible. So I get the best apps
[01:13:12.280 --> 01:13:19.640]   possible. I love Apple. I've had Apple Max since 1984. Every year I paid $2,500 at Macy's
[01:13:19.640 --> 01:13:25.720]   for the very first Macintosh in the first hundred days. And I've had Max ever since. I feel like
[01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:31.160]   is absolutely clear. Apple's going down the same road. They went with jobs left the first time.
[01:13:31.160 --> 01:13:35.800]   They're falling apart and things like that. Steve would have figured it all out and had a plan
[01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:40.680]   and the path. It's like they're throwing crap against the wall at this point. I just feel like
[01:13:40.680 --> 01:13:44.440]   they have. It could be the opposite because a lot of these could be Steve. Like these could be Steve
[01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:48.040]   Jobs legacy that they have to get past. They can't figure it out. Well, he was like app adverse and
[01:13:48.040 --> 01:13:53.560]   he was maybe, you know, app upgrade, maybe it's Steve's neurotic paranoia and just being manifest.
[01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:56.600]   But this is a level we see was clearly not Steve Jobs. They'll be to be seen. That's what gives me
[01:13:56.600 --> 01:14:02.200]   a lot of hope is that they were maybe they'll transcend. Absolutely. And then there's iOS 7.
[01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:10.680]   Ah, you got a seatbelt. Holy moly. I was warned. Gruber warned me in his podcast the night before.
[01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:18.120]   He said some people are not going to like OS 7. Yeah. It seems to me all Apple did was focus on
[01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:23.000]   a really ugly color palette. But you could debate that. That's a matter of taste and not really do
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:29.240]   much at all to improve OS. What they did. I think the color I think the unfortunate color pod has
[01:14:29.240 --> 01:14:33.400]   like kind of taken all the attention away from the stuff that they did do. And what they kind of did
[01:14:33.400 --> 01:14:38.920]   is the interface is actually completely different. They got game developers to come in and build a
[01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:42.600]   physics engine, a particle engine. Really? It turned the entire operating system into an
[01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:46.920]   object that you can now manipulate and it's cool. It's mapped around cylinders. It's mapped around
[01:14:46.920 --> 01:14:52.600]   that. And yeah, and the fact that I think that this was such an early beta, like this was probably
[01:14:52.600 --> 01:14:56.200]   the earliest iOS beta we ever got and it's not complete. They didn't have time to get an iPad
[01:14:56.200 --> 01:14:59.240]   version done. It's very wonky. It's a lot of people are reporting things. There's
[01:14:59.240 --> 01:15:02.520]   apps that don't even work. Apps aren't finished. Like there are if you if you have it and it's
[01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:05.720]   under NDA, but if developers have it, there are apps on there that are just are not done yet.
[01:15:05.720 --> 01:15:11.000]   Completely right. Not done yet. But you can see that the bones are there and I'm I'm much more
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:16.440]   confident in them fixing the pallets and rendering the icons and finishing the apps. And I would be
[01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:20.520]   if the 3D engine and particle effects and the new interactions were broken because that would be
[01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:25.480]   very hard to fix. So you're you're okay. We talked about this yesterday with the the new interactions
[01:15:25.480 --> 01:15:30.040]   and my big thing is like I'm trying to figure out the layers of what lives on top and what lives
[01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:34.440]   on the bottom, you know, wallpapers on the bottom control centers on top. That all makes sense.
[01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:38.920]   Do you think that people aren't going to be freaked out? I think they read right like the first
[01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:42.680]   the first iPhone was built by a bunch of OpenGL people just so they could have fast animation and
[01:15:42.680 --> 01:15:47.480]   smooth transitions and it birthed the gaming industry on iOS. Like my second like just by happenstance
[01:15:47.480 --> 01:15:51.560]   and this new one, they rolled a bunch of the stuff they built for the interface into new gaming code.
[01:15:51.560 --> 01:15:54.920]   You can get a lot of the gaming stuff for free now. And I like that they're continuing to
[01:15:54.920 --> 01:15:58.680]   gamify iOS. There's apps in there that I don't think they've shown off yet that are literally
[01:15:58.680 --> 01:16:04.360]   like playing games. The entire thing is enjoyable and delightful in a visceral way that iOS wasn't
[01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:09.720]   before and they could fail. Absolutely could fail at realizing it by the time they launch but they
[01:16:09.720 --> 01:16:14.360]   still have, you know, three or four months to clean it up and make it coherent enough that it works.
[01:16:14.360 --> 01:16:20.920]   Marco Arment, the creator of Instapaper said iOS quote iOS seven is full of APIs. I wish I had years
[01:16:20.920 --> 01:16:26.040]   ago could have saved me months and enabled otherwise impractical features. Chris Marco is probably never
[01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:30.440]   going to write another program again having cashed out with Tumblr. He's on his beach. I don't think
[01:16:30.440 --> 01:16:35.960]   he'll be writing anymore but that's encouraging from a number one top apple developer. He says this
[01:16:35.960 --> 01:16:40.120]   is good. The developers take to almost every single developer I spoke to is incredibly
[01:16:40.120 --> 01:16:43.960]   enthused about it. The designers were angry as hell but the developers were really happy.
[01:16:43.960 --> 01:16:49.800]   Good. So but the designers are angry as hell. Yes. Right. And I I cannot disagree with them.
[01:16:49.800 --> 01:16:57.400]   I mean, looking ugly. Yes. It's it's like a kids operating system. Well, and there are there are
[01:16:57.400 --> 01:17:01.640]   things that are like if you look at control center, you've got little circle toggles at the top and
[01:17:01.640 --> 01:17:06.760]   then squares, I guess at the bottom, some of them launch apps but some of them actually are toggles.
[01:17:06.760 --> 01:17:11.400]   Yeah. But I'm glad we have a flashlight toggle because God knows that was the most important
[01:17:11.400 --> 01:17:14.040]   thing. The Craig Hockenberry was making too much money on his flashlight.
[01:17:16.120 --> 01:17:24.600]   Oh, the pallet's hideous notifications notifications. Nothing. Nothing was fixed,
[01:17:24.600 --> 01:17:30.840]   including the ridiculously small little touch target X that you have to clear the
[01:17:30.840 --> 01:17:35.640]   notifications with it. You can never hit. They are supposedly smarter. Like they will recognize
[01:17:35.640 --> 01:17:40.120]   cross device notifications. That's good. So what if I clant on notifications on this top? I don't
[01:17:40.120 --> 01:17:44.680]   see that's that's that's a solution to fixing notifications center and hitting that X. Just go
[01:17:44.680 --> 01:17:49.160]   back to your desktop. And they're not interactive either. You cannot unlike the desktop. You can't
[01:17:49.160 --> 01:17:53.160]   interact with them. No, well, my feeling is again, like last year, maps took up so much time and
[01:17:53.160 --> 01:17:56.760]   space that they didn't have time to do a lot of other stuff. They did do tons of API stuff like
[01:17:56.760 --> 01:18:00.600]   election views last year. This year, this whole interface, I mean, they started this eight months
[01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:05.560]   ago at when Scott Forest all left and they've been sprinting to near exhaustion to get this done
[01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:11.000]   and they didn't finish on time. And this is not a beta. Like people think beta like Google or
[01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:15.080]   beta like, Oh, it's a sneak preview of what they're going to release in the fall. This is a very hot
[01:18:15.080 --> 01:18:19.960]   beta. It's going to change and change some say even the release of any version of iOS is a beta
[01:18:19.960 --> 01:18:25.320]   or OS 10 is a beta. And you know, Alex Lindsey says never install the first version of iOS or
[01:18:25.320 --> 01:18:30.440]   OS 10. Wait for point one because it that's the beta. Well, this is different in that it's a lot
[01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:34.680]   more solid than previous betas, but he's just not finished. Like they're literally apps on here
[01:18:34.680 --> 01:18:39.080]   that have not been done. Okay, but if you go to the iOS web page on the Apple store, I mean,
[01:18:39.080 --> 01:18:43.000]   they have images. They say, see it in action, but they're not showing everything. I recommend
[01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:46.360]   you look at the stuff that's missing from here and you get an idea of what's not. Do you genuinely
[01:18:46.360 --> 01:18:51.320]   believe that they're going to go in and radically change the look and feel of the icons in this
[01:18:51.320 --> 01:18:56.040]   color palette? Because if so, yeah, if they're going to change it, then we all need to, you know,
[01:18:56.040 --> 01:18:59.960]   hunt down some crows and bring them over to Apple so that they can eat them because they've got
[01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:04.600]   this on their website. Big giant. I agree with you. I agree with you. Absolutely. And again,
[01:19:04.600 --> 01:19:08.280]   there's a thing I heard back at Macworld was that it was going to make a lot of fans of rich
[01:19:08.280 --> 01:19:13.480]   texture design cry. And it absolutely did that. But that is something that's fixable. This Apple
[01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:17.800]   seems like the previous Apple seems like once, you know, Steve Jobs made a decision, this icon
[01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:22.120]   has to be bluer. That's the icon it was, even if they were much better icons, this Apple can
[01:19:22.120 --> 01:19:26.840]   change. And I think that they put this out in their listening. And like you look at the photo
[01:19:26.840 --> 01:19:31.880]   photos icon, it's a done icon. You look at some of the other icons, they look like wireframes to me
[01:19:31.880 --> 01:19:40.600]   still. I'll tell you why they can't, because they have just told every app developer in the world,
[01:19:40.600 --> 01:19:45.720]   fix your app, make it this palette, make it look like this. And they're working really hard because
[01:19:45.720 --> 01:19:52.360]   current apps look crappy in this new iOS. And so if I'm an app guy, I'm immediately changing my
[01:19:52.360 --> 01:19:56.840]   design. And if then Apple in three months is always, you never mind. Well, a lot of developers
[01:19:56.840 --> 01:20:00.920]   to be really a mess. A lot of developers, initial action was screw you. I'm not changing my design
[01:20:00.920 --> 01:20:04.840]   at all. I'm not doing that. I have to. But the reaction, like one of the key principles of this
[01:20:04.840 --> 01:20:08.840]   design, like one is clarity. And I don't think they've achieved that. The other is deference.
[01:20:08.840 --> 01:20:12.120]   And there's they actually want to get out of the way of your content, but they want to get out of
[01:20:12.120 --> 01:20:15.880]   the way of your apps. They said like, if you want to make a green felt app, please do. We'll get out
[01:20:15.880 --> 01:20:19.240]   of your way. And it'll be the best looking green felt app you've ever seen. So they are,
[01:20:19.240 --> 01:20:24.040]   they don't necessarily want anyone to look at the way that they look. There is no felt. That's
[01:20:24.040 --> 01:20:30.600]   one good thing. No more stitched leather. No Apple felt no stitched leather. No more Steve Jobs G3
[01:20:30.600 --> 01:20:34.840]   in the line, my friends. Yeah. So there are some things. We'll talk a little bit more about this.
[01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:39.640]   And we'll talk a little more about the NSA because we know more now about what the NSA's
[01:20:39.640 --> 01:20:45.080]   spying is up to in just a bit. Deeter Bones here from the Verge, our mobile guy, iPhone guy,
[01:20:45.080 --> 01:20:49.400]   iPhone and Android, everything. I mean, I got a blackberry at home. What's your daily driver,
[01:20:49.400 --> 01:20:53.560]   what's the phone? Where do you have your girlfriend's number? Where's that? I've got it
[01:20:53.560 --> 01:20:59.320]   everywhere. No, right now. Right now it's it's the one. Yeah, baby. That's a nice phone. Yeah.
[01:20:59.880 --> 01:21:04.360]   If the battery life, but I figured it out. So have I. What's your secret? Well, I have two
[01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:09.320]   solutions. You have two phones. I've got a mophie. Oh, okay. I have the mophie too. I've also,
[01:21:09.320 --> 01:21:13.400]   I've given up on the Censile. I'm trying a bunch of different haproms. They should be doing better.
[01:21:13.400 --> 01:21:19.400]   Yeah, I have. I tried tricked Royden now. This is the other one. But, but there is also a snap
[01:21:19.400 --> 01:21:25.320]   dragon battery minder that I've always been afraid of these things like the task managers and stuff.
[01:21:25.320 --> 01:21:28.200]   Yeah, they always screw it up usually. But this one is pretty good because it's all
[01:21:28.200 --> 01:21:33.400]   his wake locks. This is a from Qualcomm. It's called snap dragon battery guru doubles the life.
[01:21:33.400 --> 01:21:37.800]   I'm gonna tell it out. You tell it things like don't wake up. Stop waking up. Yeah, there was
[01:21:37.800 --> 01:21:41.320]   there's I tried other wake lock tools and they're all too complicated. I bet that was
[01:21:41.320 --> 01:21:46.360]   was automatic. It watches you for three days. What's we called snap dragon battery manager.
[01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:49.960]   All right. There you go. There's a little tip for you. Chad was making fun of me. I actually
[01:21:49.960 --> 01:21:53.960]   have an iPhone. I have a Nexus four. I have a blackberry tan. I still have a palm for you. Plus
[01:21:53.960 --> 01:21:58.840]   he does use them all. Nobody's making fun of you. You'll like if you have a palm free,
[01:21:58.840 --> 01:22:04.280]   you'll like multitasking in the new I. Oh absolutely. No. Web less is the most successful,
[01:22:04.280 --> 01:22:08.520]   non-successful operating system in history. Well, somebody wrote an article saying Microsoft won
[01:22:08.520 --> 01:22:13.960]   flat. You know, when they introduced Swiss flat design, everybody mocked them and now everybody's
[01:22:13.960 --> 01:22:17.720]   doing it. It's a different. I mean, Microsoft had to do that to get performance out of a system
[01:22:17.720 --> 01:22:22.440]   that couldn't render mask or composite on the fly. And they made a brilliant design language out of
[01:22:22.440 --> 01:22:27.560]   it. Apple went more flat, but they're also doing it in a. Have you been following the
[01:22:27.560 --> 01:22:36.200]   Windows phone Twitter account? They've just been insufferable. We won. Yeah. Well, yeah, sell some
[01:22:36.200 --> 01:22:39.480]   phones and you can say that. And Metro is also much more oppressive design language. I think
[01:22:39.480 --> 01:22:43.800]   that what Apple is going for. Yeah. I am, you know, I am a little hopeful about what you talked
[01:22:43.800 --> 01:22:48.840]   about with the underlying API is the particle engine, things like that. That means that you
[01:22:48.840 --> 01:22:54.120]   can do more with this. And maybe if it comes up, things like the idea of the parallax in the
[01:22:54.120 --> 01:22:58.760]   desk. The multitasking is fantastic. Yeah. All right. And battery life should benefit too.
[01:22:58.760 --> 01:23:01.560]   This could be an amazing phone. And I want to be clear because some people will say that, you know,
[01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:06.280]   I'm telling people not to complain. I want people to complain as loudly as possible so that Apple
[01:23:06.280 --> 01:23:10.040]   feels compelled to improve the visual design of this before it's released. So the thing I'm most
[01:23:10.040 --> 01:23:13.880]   excited just real quick, most excited is multitasking. Apps are going to be able to wake up in the
[01:23:13.880 --> 01:23:19.240]   background and update without having to open it. So I'll finally be able to have a Twitter app that
[01:23:19.240 --> 01:23:25.000]   doesn't feel like it's 45 minutes behind while it loads. Always super excited. Yeah. I will,
[01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:29.880]   I will echo Mike in the chat room who says, if you if Apple's listening, it looks like the
[01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:35.000]   Easter Bunny took a Jell-a-being crap on my iPhone. Let the visual designers get in there.
[01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:42.840]   Google, Google, Lisa Frank. Yeah, Lisa Frank. There you go. You must have little kids.
[01:23:42.840 --> 01:23:48.040]   No, no, just remember you are a little kid. Yeah. That's what it is. You remember Lisa Frank.
[01:23:48.040 --> 01:23:53.320]   Hey, before we talk about stamps.com, our sponsor, I want to show you a little bit of what you might
[01:23:53.320 --> 01:24:00.520]   have missed this week. If you missed a minute, on Twitch previously on Twitch security now.
[01:24:00.520 --> 01:24:07.080]   As far as I know, Leo, this podcast is the first disclosure of what the NSA's PRISM program is,
[01:24:07.080 --> 01:24:13.560]   that it is a tap, an optical fiber tap on these companies. This week in Google, if I ever not
[01:24:13.560 --> 01:24:17.800]   listened to ways, I'm in trouble. If I listened to ways, I've found all kinds of new ways. Oh, I love
[01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:22.280]   it. I've been driving the same route for 20 years. Just two days ago, I found an early new route.
[01:24:22.280 --> 01:24:33.400]   The Social Hour. I tweet about shows, apps, episodes. Of course. When do I tweet? All day long, y'all.
[01:24:33.400 --> 01:24:38.200]   Windows weekly. When you buy an Apple device, you bring it out the world. People see it. That's the
[01:24:38.200 --> 01:24:42.680]   half the point of having an Apple device, so people can see that you have it. This little black trash
[01:24:42.680 --> 01:24:47.080]   can thing. Is it sits behind your computer in your office where no one's ever going to see it?
[01:24:47.080 --> 01:24:52.520]   You would have to be insufferably self-centered and go out and tell people to show people pictures
[01:24:52.520 --> 01:25:00.360]   of it. You'd have to show you my computer. What kind of a loser? Who is that? Like, this is a device
[01:25:00.360 --> 01:25:05.640]   from another age. I cannot believe they made this thing. Twit. Test drive one today.
[01:25:05.640 --> 01:25:10.360]   How do you like my little trash can thing? I've been carrying it around all day.
[01:25:10.360 --> 01:25:12.440]   Yeah, it's an Mac Pro. Congratulations.
[01:25:12.440 --> 01:25:19.320]   Speaking of Easter Bunny, crap. This could well, never mind. That's a that's a big Easter Bunny.
[01:25:19.320 --> 01:25:25.400]   It's like a hat, Leo. A very nice air-cooled hat. Paul was very funny on that. We will talk
[01:25:25.400 --> 01:25:31.240]   about what Steve Gibson did to do. I think accurately about the NSA spying program. In fact,
[01:25:31.240 --> 01:25:36.760]   there's some more revelations today that confirm what he said on security now earlier this week.
[01:25:36.760 --> 01:25:41.560]   That's coming up in a little bit. But first, a word from stamps.com. If you are in a business,
[01:25:41.560 --> 01:25:46.600]   you know that a lot of time is wasted. A lot of money is wasted dealing with the post office
[01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:51.320]   time drive in there, parking, getting in there. If you're buying a postage meter,
[01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:57.960]   I didn't know this. Postage meter ink can be as much as 100 times more expensive
[01:25:57.960 --> 01:26:03.320]   than ink jet ink, which is already too expensive. Stamps.com eliminates the postage meter.
[01:26:03.320 --> 01:26:08.680]   Let's you print your own US postage from your computer, your printer. Use a laser printer.
[01:26:08.680 --> 01:26:13.720]   It's cheaper. It prints right on the envelopes if you want with not just the stamp,
[01:26:13.720 --> 01:26:20.040]   the indicia for the stamp, but your company logo that return a dress. It could pull addresses out of
[01:26:20.040 --> 01:26:25.160]   your computer's address book, your QuickBooks. If you sell on Amazon, eBay, Etsy, PayPal,
[01:26:25.160 --> 01:26:31.320]   pull it right from there, it does so much more than just looking and putting a stamp on an envelope
[01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:36.920]   or a package. It'll help you choose the right class of mail as well. Stamps.com is postage on
[01:26:36.920 --> 01:26:41.800]   demand 24/7 whenever your business needs it. If you do a lot of mailing in business, this is
[01:26:41.800 --> 01:26:49.320]   so much better. You'll save up to 80% over a postage meter. You never have to go to the post office.
[01:26:49.320 --> 01:26:53.320]   Again, actually the post office comes to you. They love stamps.com. They'll pick up any package,
[01:26:53.320 --> 01:26:58.600]   schedule a free pickup. You can do things you can do with stamps.com you can't do with the post
[01:26:58.600 --> 01:27:05.240]   office. Stamps.com is always open. Import addresses from your address book. You can use cost codes
[01:27:05.240 --> 01:27:11.320]   and stamp.com to attract postage, spending by a specific customer or a specific department,
[01:27:11.320 --> 01:27:17.080]   automatic address verification because you're online. It even offers discounts you don't get
[01:27:17.080 --> 01:27:24.040]   at the post office. Discounts on package insurance too in just one click. No more handwriting forms.
[01:27:24.040 --> 01:27:28.440]   It'll print out your certified mail, your return receipt, your international customs form
[01:27:28.440 --> 01:27:33.160]   automatically. I might just go on and on. Plus that great USB scale. I got mine here.
[01:27:33.160 --> 01:27:38.280]   This is worth carrying around. That is a sweet little piece of brushed aluminum.
[01:27:38.280 --> 01:27:42.440]   That thing you plug that into the computer and stamps.com knows exactly how much postage.
[01:27:42.440 --> 01:27:48.600]   Here's the deal. Go to stamps.com. Stamps.com right now. You'll see an $80 special offer on the

[01:28:24.120 --> 01:28:28.120]   Now if you're just mailing your Christmas card list, you don't need stamps.com. But if your business
[01:28:28.120 --> 01:28:34.840]   is doing mailing of any kind, be a postage pro. Use stamps.com. We thank them for their support
[01:28:34.840 --> 01:28:41.880]   of TWIT. I'm glad that you agree with me, Dieter, that the iOS is ugly. Because at first I look
[01:28:41.880 --> 01:28:47.000]   at it and I thought maybe it's me. Maybe it's me. The story I've been telling everybody is when
[01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:50.920]   the Eiffel Tower first went up, everybody in Paris hated it. They thought it was a monstrosity.
[01:28:50.920 --> 01:28:55.720]   And then it became, you know, now it's gorgeous. Now we love it. But this isn't the Eiffel Tower.
[01:28:55.720 --> 01:28:59.640]   I don't disagree with you, Leo. I just have hope that they'll fix it.
[01:28:59.640 --> 01:29:04.360]   Maybe they will. Apple's not notorious for doing that. Can you think of an example?
[01:29:04.360 --> 01:29:09.160]   Well, I mean they tweaked iOS 5 and iOS 4. They did tweets like lock screen notifications and
[01:29:09.160 --> 01:29:13.000]   things changed and the textures behind things changed as the betas came out.
[01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:16.920]   But again, this is not the old previous Apple, which is what's giving me more hope.
[01:29:16.920 --> 01:29:21.480]   There are some wins here. And as I said on our coverage of WWDC,
[01:29:21.480 --> 01:29:25.640]   this Apple did three things here. It played catch up in a lot of respects,
[01:29:25.640 --> 01:29:31.320]   notifications in the control center. That's Android catch up. It copied in some cases.
[01:29:31.320 --> 01:29:34.920]   The notification center looks a lot like Android. Everything's really mixed.
[01:29:34.920 --> 01:29:41.080]   And there is innovation here as well. So they did all three and probably in roughly equal measure.
[01:29:41.080 --> 01:29:46.200]   Photos is great. Nobody could do this. But Apple, the new photo gallery has thumbnails,
[01:29:46.200 --> 01:29:51.880]   little tiny ones of your whole year. Like iPhoto, they're now organizing by the metadata.
[01:29:51.880 --> 01:29:55.880]   So it could be date time. Now, Android's a gallery's in fact, the HTC One's gallery.
[01:29:55.880 --> 01:29:59.320]   And everything is so spatially aware when you zoom in and zoom out, it keeps your eye
[01:29:59.320 --> 01:30:02.280]   aware where it's supposed to be. So you never lose track of where you are in space.
[01:30:02.280 --> 01:30:08.040]   So it's an advantage Apple has. The question is, is this design, and we could get into really
[01:30:08.040 --> 01:30:13.080]   nerdy stuff about font weights and whatnot, is the design in an uncanny valley where it's
[01:30:13.080 --> 01:30:17.080]   almost great, but then it falls into this weird space. And if they just tweak around the edges and
[01:30:17.080 --> 01:30:22.360]   fix a color palette, it's going to be amazing. Or is it just kind of going to be end, no matter
[01:30:22.360 --> 01:30:26.040]   how much tweaking around the edges they do? I want to point something out. So I had,
[01:30:26.040 --> 01:30:31.320]   who is a young person waving over here, vividly red hair. I'm just working out ahead.
[01:30:31.320 --> 01:30:37.400]   So you take this with, you know, I want to say no, no, it is not an uncanny valley. If you look at
[01:30:37.400 --> 01:30:43.480]   the screenshots, let's just focus on gradients of blue. You have three different types. The
[01:30:43.480 --> 01:30:47.480]   weather goes from dark blue to light blue, but then the app store goes from light blue to dark
[01:30:47.480 --> 01:30:53.160]   blue. The videos go from a teal to a darker blue. That's what I'm saying is if they fix that
[01:30:53.160 --> 01:30:57.560]   inconsistency. Game center, it's like game center, like everything is flat except for game center,
[01:30:57.560 --> 01:31:01.640]   which is shiny. It's like the effect. We do know that there were two different design teams.
[01:31:01.640 --> 01:31:06.680]   And so this is a photo from dribble of someone who redesigned it. I like it.
[01:31:06.680 --> 01:31:13.000]   Where it has more white space. Gradients are consistent. And also look at the app store icon
[01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:17.960]   or the iTunes store icon. You have the weirdest looking musical note you've ever seen,
[01:31:17.960 --> 01:31:22.760]   but in the and the redesign one, it's an actual music note, which you would expect to see on an
[01:31:22.760 --> 01:31:28.920]   icon. And what is the new settings icon? Is that a oven, a stove burner? Is that what that is?
[01:31:28.920 --> 01:31:33.320]   Is that for cooking? It's like here you'd have in a watch or something. What is the worst bicycle
[01:31:33.320 --> 01:31:39.160]   gear ever? It's terrible. It needs Apple's visual design team to spend a lot of time fixing it.
[01:31:39.160 --> 01:31:43.480]   But this is why I'm asking for in the uncanny valley is if they fix all these little details,
[01:31:43.480 --> 01:31:47.400]   maybe just a little bit. Just then it'll pop us right back out and it'll be amazing.
[01:31:47.400 --> 01:31:50.200]   I don't like the I don't like the palette either. I mean, I think it's too
[01:31:51.240 --> 01:31:54.840]   it's too young as an old person. Well, it's also I mean, it's not good. I mean,
[01:31:54.840 --> 01:31:57.560]   sometimes they have yellow on white and sometimes there's no contrast. I mean,
[01:31:57.560 --> 01:32:00.920]   there's a lot of basic tenants of visual design that they did not follow for this.
[01:32:00.920 --> 01:32:05.720]   But I do have to point out that one of the reasons you change design is to make the old
[01:32:05.720 --> 01:32:10.920]   design look old and to sell new phones. If you don't have, and I think we're rapidly entering
[01:32:10.920 --> 01:32:15.960]   that era where there's not a lot new to do, you have to make some differentiation when
[01:32:15.960 --> 01:32:21.080]   Detroit got in that situation with cars, they put fins on them. It doesn't do anything, but it
[01:32:21.080 --> 01:32:25.960]   makes the old car the old finless car look old fashioned. Absolutely. So this could just be fins.
[01:32:25.960 --> 01:32:30.120]   I just want the fins to look a little nicer. They aren't the nicest films, but neither, you know,
[01:32:30.120 --> 01:32:34.440]   those some of those fins. They're wire mesh fins at this point. Yeah, but maybe that's it.
[01:32:34.440 --> 01:32:39.000]   You know, I'll give you that and I hope you're right. I do think radio is great. They only gave
[01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:44.120]   it a few minutes. But Apple apparently did make the deals with the records companies as we had
[01:32:44.120 --> 01:32:52.040]   presumed they would. It's part of iTunes desktop Mac desktop windows and iOS. You've got curated
[01:32:52.040 --> 01:32:56.120]   playlists. You've got automatically generated Pandora style. And again, it's not for us. We're
[01:32:56.120 --> 01:32:59.640]   all using something already is for everyone who was not using anything and will use it now because
[01:32:59.640 --> 01:33:03.720]   it's I think they'll love it. I think, you know, normal people, my mom will love it. Yeah. People
[01:33:03.720 --> 01:33:09.480]   who are not Spotify or Mag or RDO or songs or whatever, songs or users will say, Oh, this is great. Now
[01:33:09.480 --> 01:33:13.640]   it's US only right now, but that's not that's not Apple's fault. That's the record. It's really
[01:33:13.640 --> 01:33:19.640]   painful. Yeah, this is another tumble log Johnny Ives redesigns things. He takes all these,
[01:33:19.640 --> 01:33:24.120]   all these normal designs we're familiar with like the Mercedes logo there. That's good.
[01:33:24.120 --> 01:33:29.720]   Plants versus zombies coming soon, Leo. Yeah. Plants versus zombies too. It looks good. Time travel.
[01:33:29.720 --> 01:33:35.400]   Yeah. Looks fun. Yeah. All right. That's enough of that. You're making me sick. It's like the
[01:33:35.400 --> 01:33:41.960]   Easter Bunny threw up all of it with. I'm trying to find good things. Air drop. Yep. Don't have to
[01:33:41.960 --> 01:33:46.760]   connect it anymore. I can just drag and drop files from an app. Don't have to bump. No more bumping.
[01:33:46.760 --> 01:33:52.440]   The weather app is beautiful. Yeah. You know, they led with the weather app. Who uses the
[01:33:52.440 --> 01:33:56.920]   generic weather app? Isn't everybody upgrading like weather HD, which is only show the apps that
[01:33:56.920 --> 01:34:01.560]   were finished. Right. And they gave that one a lot more attention than to deserve cameras. Nice.
[01:34:01.560 --> 01:34:06.360]   The Instagramming of camera. It's fast. It's fast. It's big. Yeah. Because I'll tell you what,
[01:34:06.360 --> 01:34:12.680]   still Android cameras in general sluggish buggy, not great. Microsoft is a great job with the cameras.
[01:34:12.680 --> 01:34:17.800]   It's nice to see Apple really accelerated. Yeah. Got camera. It's arguably the best camera out
[01:34:17.800 --> 01:34:23.080]   there right now for a phone. But you know, they got square aspect ratios. They've got filters.
[01:34:23.080 --> 01:34:27.080]   I'm so happy about that, Leo, because every second email I got was we have added filters to our app.
[01:34:27.080 --> 01:34:31.160]   It's like a two to app. No more filters to it. No more. No more. It's an easy thing to do.
[01:34:31.160 --> 01:34:35.160]   Siri, this is something that arguably Apple needed to do some catch up on.
[01:34:35.160 --> 01:34:38.280]   Yeah. Well, there's arguably still have to do some catch up on. They didn't go that far.
[01:34:38.280 --> 01:34:42.120]   They didn't do that much at all. No. They knew voices. So you have a few new voices,
[01:34:42.120 --> 01:34:46.280]   a new interface. It ties in now to a few more services. But we discussed this on Mac.
[01:34:46.280 --> 01:34:49.800]   Wait, they're still bound to their nuanced deal. They don't have the same freedom that Google has.
[01:34:49.800 --> 01:34:55.000]   Well, to be honest, like, do you care that much about Siri? I use it all the time.
[01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:58.840]   Really? I would care if we're better. Right. I'm too lazy to type now.
[01:34:58.840 --> 01:35:03.960]   Don't you use a voice on your Android device? Not that I'll. Oh, I dictate all the time. Yeah.
[01:35:03.960 --> 01:35:08.680]   Wow. And I like the Android device for that. And I use Google now. And I've set it up so that I
[01:35:08.680 --> 01:35:17.480]   can just stroke up on my phone and Google speech search launches. I think that the speech is
[01:35:17.480 --> 01:35:21.960]   important on mobile, especially because the keyboard's a tiny. You have little pointy
[01:35:21.960 --> 01:35:27.960]   girl fingers. And sausage fingers. What keyboard do you use on? I use SwiftKey. Yeah.
[01:35:27.960 --> 01:35:32.440]   That's the number one seller, but Swipes could do. Google now has a keyboard, which is kind of fun.
[01:35:32.440 --> 01:35:36.440]   Which is hilarious. They're putting their own keyboard on the store.
[01:35:36.440 --> 01:35:40.520]   On the Google Play. As we move to wearables and stuff like that, these like Siri and Google
[01:35:40.520 --> 01:35:45.800]   now are going to be the best that gets projected onto those. And I feel like Apple is just not
[01:35:45.800 --> 01:35:52.120]   advancing Siri as fast as we hoped it would. It's pleasant. It's affable. It's not adorable.
[01:35:52.120 --> 01:35:59.640]   Message is still broken. But it bounces now. It bounces a bouncing. Well, you really put up a
[01:35:59.640 --> 01:36:04.120]   really good article that iOS 7 is actually the most scumorphic if you think about it.
[01:36:04.120 --> 01:36:10.520]   It's so physical. Even though it's flat and it doesn't look scumorphic, it acts scumorphic.
[01:36:10.520 --> 01:36:13.000]   There's no textures, but the entire world's not built. It's alive.
[01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:17.560]   Well, that's a good thing to go for in a phone. What I want to see. What I want to see.
[01:36:17.560 --> 01:36:18.200]   What I want to see. What I want to see. What I want to see. What I want to see.
[01:36:18.200 --> 01:36:18.200]   What I want to see. What I want to see. What I want to see. What I want to see. What I want to see.
[01:36:18.200 --> 01:36:18.760]   What I want to see. What I want to see. What I want to see. What I want to see. What I want to see.
[01:36:18.760 --> 01:36:18.760]   What I want to see. What I want to see. What I want to see. What I want to see. What I want to see.
[01:36:18.760 --> 01:36:24.600]   What I want to see. What I want to see. What I want to see. What I want to see. What I want to see.
[01:36:24.600 --> 01:36:30.840]   What I want to see. What I want to see. What I want to see. What I want to see. What I want to see.
[01:36:30.840 --> 01:36:37.880]   What I want to see. What I want to see. What I want to see. What I want to see. What I want to see.
[01:36:37.880 --> 01:36:43.800]   What I want to see. What I want to see. What I want to see. What I want to see. What I want to see.
[01:36:43.800 --> 01:36:48.200]   What I want to see. What I want to see. What I want to see. What I want to see. What I want to see.
[01:36:48.200 --> 01:36:55.320]   The visual design is slightly lacking. I had an Apple T-shirt and the Apple went shoulder to shoulder.
[01:36:55.320 --> 01:37:01.000]   I'm rooting for them. I think competition is great in the cell phone space. I don't want to see
[01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:06.760]   Samsung dominates. One of the reasons I like HTC. I want to see these plucky struggling companies
[01:37:06.760 --> 01:37:11.720]   come forward with some new stuff that's exciting. I'd love to see Apple. I don't want to see Apple
[01:37:11.720 --> 01:37:15.880]   dominate, but I'd love to see it be as strong as it should be. I want all the phone platforms to
[01:37:15.880 --> 01:37:22.280]   be strong. Absolutely. Then we win. That's good for us. I hate when people fight over the phones.
[01:37:22.280 --> 01:37:25.160]   What atoms you have in your pocket. I want these companies to be fighting over us.
[01:37:25.160 --> 01:37:32.120]   It's much better. I like that. Fighting to win their customers. Sometimes you don't get the
[01:37:32.120 --> 01:37:36.440]   feeling that Apple cares so much. I want to be tempted to change phones every three to six months.
[01:37:36.440 --> 01:37:40.760]   Like really sorely tempted. Oh, I am. I do. I was going to say that. That's my life.
[01:37:42.040 --> 01:37:47.960]   Not easy. I do. So no one company should dominate. Certainly it would be a bad world for us all.
[01:37:47.960 --> 01:37:53.320]   If Samsung were to be the source of all innovation. Just look at the Galaxy S4 and what a hodgepodge
[01:37:53.320 --> 01:37:56.680]   that is. I do like that they're like the crazy uncle who'll throw everything against the wall.
[01:37:56.680 --> 01:37:59.240]   Yes, they are. Because maybe someone will take that idea and make it coherent.
[01:37:59.240 --> 01:38:01.320]   So I'm glad they're in the market, but I'm not buying the phone.
[01:38:01.320 --> 01:38:05.000]   My favorite thing about that S4 is everybody with the S3 complained that there were too many
[01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:08.360]   features and they couldn't figure it out. So they had to be like, "We're going to do some more."
[01:38:08.360 --> 01:38:14.680]   You know it punished you for that. Oh, you don't like it. Well, watch this. You think that was bad.
[01:38:14.680 --> 01:38:18.520]   Some people love them and then great, they can buy those and I'm going to get the HTC next
[01:38:18.520 --> 01:38:20.680]   because I like that a lot better and we have choice and I love that.
[01:38:20.680 --> 01:38:25.000]   It's not perfect either. Yeah. There's no perfect phone. In fact, I'm going back and forth
[01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:29.320]   about whether I should root the S4. Just go for that. I'm trying to slide between the HTC Sense
[01:38:29.320 --> 01:38:32.280]   version and the with Google version. Get the one with Sense because you can always put the Google.
[01:38:32.280 --> 01:38:35.720]   Yes. You can always plainify it, but you can't go the other way. No, that's true.
[01:38:35.720 --> 01:38:38.840]   And you want Sense. There's like the camera app, the gallery app, right?
[01:38:38.840 --> 01:38:42.520]   Deeter is good. Yeah, that's pretty good. The gallery app's got some bugs that drive
[01:38:42.520 --> 01:38:46.600]   increases. Well, some of the features just don't work. Yeah. And this is the same problem with the S4.
[01:38:46.600 --> 01:38:51.400]   They have all these photo features that don't do anything. So, I mean, if I were buying an
[01:38:51.400 --> 01:38:55.160]   Android phone, I'd probably wait for the with Google and get the S4 with Google.
[01:38:55.160 --> 01:38:58.680]   I'm waiting to see what the Moto X is. What do you know about the Moto X?
[01:38:58.680 --> 01:39:03.240]   I mean, I know what's leaked and that it's not going to change the world.
[01:39:03.240 --> 01:39:08.040]   It's not going to be a flexible screen. 8,000 megapixels. Well, there's the Moto X, the big
[01:39:08.040 --> 01:39:11.880]   important one. And then I think there's another one a little sooner. And that sooner one's going to
[01:39:11.880 --> 01:39:16.520]   be whatever. It'll be in Nexus, but it won't be a special. I want my Google now plus phone.
[01:39:16.520 --> 01:39:21.880]   That'll be one of my next phones. You mean like like like Facebook, Google now and Google
[01:39:21.880 --> 01:39:25.800]   plus will be the main interface of the phone. Yeah. Yeah. And those Google tiles will just,
[01:39:25.800 --> 01:39:29.560]   I'll turn it on. I'll have all my cards just waiting for. I related this anecdote before, but
[01:39:29.560 --> 01:39:35.960]   when we were at Google IO, I walked up to Bradley Horowitz, who runs Google plus and said, nice job.
[01:39:35.960 --> 01:39:39.000]   It was a good speech, really enjoyed it. I'm excited by what you guys are doing. But you know
[01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:44.760]   what I'd love to see a Facebook home, but for Google plus. And he went, oh, well, how about
[01:39:44.760 --> 01:39:48.360]   something even better? Yeah. So there's a lot of nudge, nudge, wink, wink, wink. There's a lot of
[01:39:48.360 --> 01:39:53.400]   her. Yeah. Probably has to do with balloons over New Zealand. Balloon phone.
[01:39:53.400 --> 01:39:57.400]   Balloon phone is what I want now. I couldn't have done with some balloons over Moscone this
[01:39:57.400 --> 01:40:02.520]   weekend. That would have been nice. But you know, if they could get the antenna for that balloon
[01:40:02.520 --> 01:40:06.440]   internet into a phone and have it work, like the Korean phones over TV antennas. Yeah.
[01:40:06.440 --> 01:40:12.200]   I mean, I probably could. I had, you know, giant extend antennas on cell phones back in the day.
[01:40:12.200 --> 01:40:16.200]   I'd do it again. You remember that? Yeah. You're that old? Yeah. I didn't think you would.
[01:40:16.200 --> 01:40:25.800]   Anything else to say about WWDC? No, I think we covered. Most people thought it was the best
[01:40:25.800 --> 01:40:28.680]   dub dub in a long time. Really? Yeah. All the people who are there, the developers,
[01:40:28.680 --> 01:40:32.360]   I guess encouraging designers had some trouble with it, but they're making their own apps anyway.
[01:40:32.360 --> 01:40:35.960]   But the people there almost 201 said that it was their best dub dub ever. And I should point
[01:40:35.960 --> 01:40:40.360]   out that the way Apple does this is the public and press are invited to the keynote. Yes. And
[01:40:40.360 --> 01:40:45.800]   then thrown out. Yes. And everything that happens thereafter is completely NDA. Yes. Anybody who
[01:40:45.800 --> 01:40:50.440]   was there can't talk. Yes. So you might get dribs and drabs and stuff. I guess now the sessions,
[01:40:50.440 --> 01:40:53.800]   if you're a developer up, but you have the same restrictions you can't talk about.
[01:40:53.800 --> 01:40:58.280]   So we don't really kind of know, but it's good to know that the developers were excited
[01:40:58.280 --> 01:41:01.560]   about what they saw. We don't know what it was. Twitter and conversations and everything was
[01:41:01.560 --> 01:41:06.360]   incredibly positive. That's great. Everyone left really happy. Big question that they never
[01:41:06.360 --> 01:41:11.000]   addressed was the problem and developers would care about this a lot with cloud services,
[01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:15.480]   particularly cloud sync. That wasn't discussed publicly. Pardon me? That wasn't just,
[01:41:15.480 --> 01:41:19.000]   that was not discussed publicly. But they did talk about that in private.
[01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:22.840]   Maybe. You can't say. I believe Apple didn't leave anything unaddressed.
[01:41:23.560 --> 01:41:29.320]   I just know. I actually have heard that from some developers that not only did they address it,
[01:41:29.320 --> 01:41:34.760]   but they kind of did a may call. But yeah, we screwed up cloud sync. We know it's broken.
[01:41:34.760 --> 01:41:37.720]   They don't even use it. But how many times do they get to do that?
[01:41:37.720 --> 01:41:41.720]   Right. I mean, this is like the, you know, they didn't change names this time. Yeah, right.
[01:41:41.720 --> 01:41:46.680]   All right. Well, we'll watch with interest. And you know, I'll buy all their crap anyway. I don't
[01:41:49.160 --> 01:41:53.880]   want to believe. I want to believe. All right. We're going to talk about the NSA. I think Steve
[01:41:53.880 --> 01:42:00.120]   Gibson on Wednesday, he had, and if you haven't seen it, he had an excellent security now.
[01:42:00.120 --> 01:42:06.440]   When he started, he said, Leo, I think I figured out what's going on. And I don't know. I said,
[01:42:06.440 --> 01:42:09.560]   I was very skeptical because I said, well, nobody can talk about it because you're
[01:42:09.560 --> 01:42:14.920]   joined by the Patriot Act that if you will get a national security letter, you can't say anything.
[01:42:14.920 --> 01:42:21.080]   So I think we don't know. He said, well, listen, and at the end of it, I thought he makes a good
[01:42:21.080 --> 01:42:27.000]   case. So we'll talk about that in just a little bit. And now that there is more and more going on,
[01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:32.440]   there's more stories coming out. Declan McCullough had a very scary story today
[01:42:32.440 --> 01:42:37.880]   in the CNET. We'll talk about that in just a second. Before we do though, let's get one more
[01:42:37.880 --> 01:42:44.760]   add in here so that I can buy all that Apple crap. This is GoToMyPC from Citrix. GoToMyPC.
[01:42:44.920 --> 01:42:50.040]   is, I got to say, I use it all the time. Citrix is really starting to put together
[01:42:50.040 --> 01:42:56.280]   an array of apps for business that are just with GoToMeeting, GoToMyPC,
[01:42:56.280 --> 01:43:01.880]   PodioShareFile. I keep saying to them, guys, you're going to make a suite. This is all great stuff. Go
[01:43:01.880 --> 01:43:07.240]   to MyPC means you can leave the office. Now you may say, well, what do you mean?
[01:43:07.240 --> 01:43:13.960]   All right, before you leave, put GoToMyPC on Mac or PC. And now wherever you are, at home,
[01:43:13.960 --> 01:43:19.720]   at the pool with the kids, you can access your office computer. And even from an iPhone, an
[01:43:19.720 --> 01:43:27.160]   Android phone, an iPad, Windows, accessing Windows 8 on an iPad, it's just kind of mind-blowing.
[01:43:27.160 --> 01:43:33.960]   It's fast. It works well. It is the ultimate remote access. Totally secure uses SSL so your
[01:43:33.960 --> 01:43:38.200]   transactions are completely encrypted. In fact, I know a lot of people use GoToMyPC so that they
[01:43:38.200 --> 01:43:43.240]   can use their iPad at an open access spot, say, at an internet cafe and feel like they're secure,
[01:43:43.240 --> 01:43:47.560]   which they are because the traffic is completely encrypted going right back to the office.
[01:43:47.560 --> 01:43:53.560]   It's very easy to use. You can run any program. You can access any network resource. You can send
[01:43:53.560 --> 01:43:58.600]   and receive email. Even if you don't have an app on your phone, you can run that app via GoToMyPC
[01:43:58.600 --> 01:44:03.240]   on your computer at work. It's very easy to try. In fact, I've got a good deal for you. 30 days
[01:44:03.240 --> 01:44:09.240]   free. Just go to GoToMyPC.com. The apps are always free. Click the Try Free. Do this on your
[01:44:09.240 --> 01:44:13.480]   office computer. Click the Try Free button. End of the promo code TWIT. Then install it on your
[01:44:13.480 --> 01:44:17.800]   office computer. You won't need the IT guy to come over. You don't need to punch a hole in a firewall.
[01:44:17.800 --> 01:44:24.840]   It uses NAT traversal. It works perfectly well in every environment. It is a great solution. Go to
[01:44:24.840 --> 01:44:30.200]   MyPC. Citrix invented remote access. They actually licensed it back to Microsoft. They are the
[01:44:30.200 --> 01:44:35.400]   kings of this. For many years now, GoToMyPC has been the simplest, easiest, and best way to access
[01:44:35.400 --> 01:44:42.520]   your computer. Windows or Mac. Go to MyPC.com. Use the offer code TWIT for 30 days free.
[01:44:42.520 --> 01:44:49.160]   Steve, this is interesting. We're seeing more and more about the NSA, about prison. We talked
[01:44:49.160 --> 01:44:57.720]   about it a lot about it last week. According to Declan McCullough, the NSA disclosed in a secret
[01:44:57.720 --> 01:45:07.480]   Capitol Hill briefing that they have many, many people at the NSA who can listen into any phone
[01:45:07.480 --> 01:45:13.080]   call without a warrant. The analyst at the NSA just says, "Yeah, I want to hear that."
[01:45:13.080 --> 01:45:18.520]   If the NSA wants to write a statement, if the NSA wants to listen to the phone,
[01:45:18.520 --> 01:45:24.120]   an analyst decision is sufficient without any other legal authorization required.
[01:45:27.080 --> 01:45:31.320]   This is revealed by a congressman who serves on the House Judiciary Committee.
[01:45:31.320 --> 01:45:40.840]   It's worse than we thought, frankly. The evidence is strong that they are collecting
[01:45:40.840 --> 01:45:45.800]   all electronic transmissions inside and out of the USA. The NSA is not supposed to listen
[01:45:45.800 --> 01:45:52.200]   into calls that are just US to US. Apparently they do and they can. Emails, instant messages,
[01:45:52.200 --> 01:46:00.600]   text messages, phone calls, everything you do on the internet. Steve was trying to reconcile
[01:46:00.600 --> 01:46:04.920]   the notion that these companies like Google and Facebook just blanket denial. No, they don't have
[01:46:04.920 --> 01:46:10.680]   access to our servers with what people like Edward Snowden and now others are saying,
[01:46:10.680 --> 01:46:17.240]   "Yeah, we can see everything. We can watch people type." Steve supposes and I think he's probably
[01:46:17.240 --> 01:46:20.840]   right, given an owner understand this. You have to understand a little bit about how the internet
[01:46:20.840 --> 01:46:25.400]   works. I think that's probably why members of Congress haven't really sussed to this yet.
[01:46:25.400 --> 01:46:31.560]   They're starting to. All companies, Google, Facebook, and just like you, have to connect to the internet.
[01:46:31.560 --> 01:46:34.920]   They may have multiple points of connection. They may have multiple internet service providers,
[01:46:34.920 --> 01:46:40.680]   but they have internet service providers. These big internet service providers are most likely
[01:46:40.680 --> 01:46:45.480]   the ones who are being wiretapped right at the connection to Google. Google doesn't know or has
[01:46:45.480 --> 01:46:50.440]   no way of monitoring this. It's after Google, but really before the public internet, it's exactly
[01:46:50.440 --> 01:46:57.080]   what the NSA was doing at AT&T. They were wiretapping AT&T so that WorldNet users,
[01:46:57.080 --> 01:47:05.160]   ISP users for WorldNet, were all the traffic into and out of their computers was monitored by the
[01:47:05.160 --> 01:47:12.600]   NSA. Now, it's also clear with the NSA building a giant facility in Utah, capable of storing five
[01:47:12.600 --> 01:47:17.960]   zettabytes of data that they are in fact storing all this stuff. What's become clear is they're not
[01:47:17.960 --> 01:47:23.800]   necessarily sifting through it or listening at any given time, but they're storing it and should
[01:47:23.800 --> 01:47:28.200]   a time come that they wanted to find out what is that Rene Richie doing when he visits the United
[01:47:28.200 --> 01:47:33.320]   States? They can go through it. Steve's argument was absolutely compelling to me.
[01:47:33.320 --> 01:47:38.120]   He even says, "Look, that's why they named it Prism. What does a Prism do? It splits light."
[01:47:38.120 --> 01:47:45.080]   They're splitting the fiber optic cables. You don't even have to assume that they're doing it
[01:47:45.640 --> 01:47:51.800]   really close to these big companies. Even if it's the most innocent innocuous situation where they're
[01:47:51.800 --> 01:47:57.080]   just doing it on the pipes going out of the country. It may waste or whatever. Even in that case,
[01:47:57.080 --> 01:48:01.720]   they're still catching so much stuff. That's just internal to you. I asked Steve, "Why would
[01:48:01.720 --> 01:48:04.840]   they do it so close to Google?" He said, "Well, because then they can do a subpoena."
[01:48:04.840 --> 01:48:11.320]   Let's say they see some traffic that's suspicious. They could say, "Well, on February 13th,
[01:48:11.320 --> 01:48:15.240]   between the hours of this and this, we saw this traffic from this IP address. Who was that? Now,
[01:48:15.240 --> 01:48:19.000]   Google now has to respond to this National Security Letter." They now have identified it
[01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:23.640]   exactly. There's a reason to say, "Oh, well, we know where this came from exactly." I suppose you
[01:48:23.640 --> 01:48:32.280]   could do that at any point on the backbone. Here's why I find it disturbing. We've seen time and
[01:48:32.280 --> 01:48:38.680]   time again, the US government using any pretext. Once they've got somebody they want to arrest,
[01:48:38.680 --> 01:48:44.920]   let's say they find something on Rene. Now, they can go back and say, "Well, let's find more stuff."
[01:48:45.400 --> 01:48:49.160]   The laws are so loosely written that I'll give you a good example. This is how they went after
[01:48:49.160 --> 01:48:54.440]   Aaron Schwartz. It is a federal crime to violate a website's term of service. That's a felony.
[01:48:54.440 --> 01:49:00.280]   I'm sure you do it all the time. If you've ever made up a name on Facebook, you violated their
[01:49:00.280 --> 01:49:05.080]   terms of service. All those kids, 13 years old and under, who are Facebook members,
[01:49:05.080 --> 01:49:08.680]   guess what? You've committed a federal crime. Now, all they have to do, they want to get you
[01:49:09.640 --> 01:49:16.200]   Dieter. Let's go back and see what that Dieter has been up to. There's so many stupid crimes they
[01:49:16.200 --> 01:49:23.160]   could get you. They add that to the list. I just don't think we can trust the government to do this
[01:49:23.160 --> 01:49:27.880]   responsibly. Diane Feinstein, apparently the chairman of the committee knows about this,
[01:49:27.880 --> 01:49:32.360]   our senator here from California. She's not been very forthcoming on this.
[01:49:32.360 --> 01:49:37.960]   Well, we've got problems multiplied on top of the problem. Whatever the actual surveillance is,
[01:49:37.960 --> 01:49:43.160]   is a problem. Then the fact that keeping what that surveillance is a secret multiplies it so
[01:49:43.160 --> 01:49:47.560]   there's no conversation. We not only do not know what they're doing, but the fact that we don't
[01:49:47.560 --> 01:49:52.360]   know is making it worse. Diane Feinstein, who heads the Senate Intelligence Committee,
[01:49:52.360 --> 01:49:56.760]   acknowledged that agencies, analysts have the ability to access the content of a call.
[01:49:56.760 --> 01:50:04.040]   It's clear now, without warrant, that the NSA and other federal agencies can listen to any call.
[01:50:05.240 --> 01:50:09.880]   And all it requires is some low-level analysts to say, and by the way, there are thousands of them.
[01:50:09.880 --> 01:50:17.240]   I'd like to hear this one. You don't think they're listening in to all sorts of traffic,
[01:50:17.240 --> 01:50:28.280]   just for fun? I mean, if it's like this straightforward, the only thing that's protecting us is obscurity,
[01:50:28.280 --> 01:50:32.680]   I guess? The sheer volumes of data? Well, that's what doesn't protect us because now,
[01:50:33.400 --> 01:50:39.000]   and I guess that's kind of to me the point, is they store it all. And then they just wait until they
[01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:47.400]   want to get somebody. I think what you're going to see, and Declan Backpedal, a little bit,
[01:50:47.400 --> 01:50:52.440]   although I don't think materially, is you're going to see a lot of threats coming out of
[01:50:52.440 --> 01:50:57.480]   the federal government. If you get a national security letter, you can't talk about it.
[01:50:59.160 --> 01:51:04.360]   Facebook, remember, asked for the right to say how many of the government requests were NSLs,
[01:51:04.360 --> 01:51:09.080]   and Google's been doing this for a while, has mushed in with all the other data.
[01:51:09.080 --> 01:51:13.960]   The feds are going to fight this. Did you see the flap, though, that happened?
[01:51:13.960 --> 01:51:18.920]   Because it's all, so Facebook published it first, and all of the requests got aggregated together
[01:51:18.920 --> 01:51:22.680]   in one giant law. Local law enforcement, federal law enforcement, NSA, doesn't matter.
[01:51:22.680 --> 01:51:26.920]   Right. But they did finally include FISA. Then Microsoft came in and said, "Yeah, well, here's ours,
[01:51:26.920 --> 01:51:31.800]   too." And then Google said, "Well, this is stupid. This doesn't help anybody because we can't figure
[01:51:31.800 --> 01:51:36.120]   out how many are actually FISA. We already do everything else, so we're not taking part."
[01:51:36.120 --> 01:51:41.720]   And then Twitter sided with Google. So now we've got all these companies yelling at the government
[01:51:41.720 --> 01:51:45.320]   to let them say stuff, but now they're taking different tactics to do it.
[01:51:45.320 --> 01:51:51.960]   Google said it's a step back for users. I don't think that's true. But the point is,
[01:51:51.960 --> 01:51:57.160]   these numbers, the Google Transparency Report, I commend them for doing it. But we aren't knowing
[01:51:57.160 --> 01:52:03.320]   the most important thing, which is what the NSA is up to. I think all things did try to do the
[01:52:03.320 --> 01:52:09.320]   math because there was a previous Transparency Report from Microsoft, but it's for the whole
[01:52:09.320 --> 01:52:12.040]   year, so you've got to solid it in half. We still just don't know.
[01:52:12.040 --> 01:52:18.200]   All right. I guess it's just a depressing subject. People are, you know, the news cycle is going
[01:52:18.200 --> 01:52:23.640]   to move on in a moment, and we'll start talking about something else. But I just think this is
[01:52:23.640 --> 01:52:31.320]   so important. I would go to the EFF page, EFF.org, where they call for action, and they give you
[01:52:31.320 --> 01:52:37.720]   ways to act. Stop mass surveillance. Tell Congress, you should, we said this last week,
[01:52:37.720 --> 01:52:41.960]   it's even more urgent now. You should tell your member of Congress, Congress, this is not okay.
[01:52:43.400 --> 01:52:49.080]   They will help you. Just enter your zip code, it'll tell you who to write to. Post-postal
[01:52:49.080 --> 01:52:55.560]   service is good, mail it, or call them. They need to identify that you're actually a constituent
[01:52:55.560 --> 01:53:02.040]   before they'll take it seriously. And if millions of people call Congress, I think they will do
[01:53:02.040 --> 01:53:05.720]   something about this. Maybe they'll at least show up to their meetings. Yeah, they all went home
[01:53:05.720 --> 01:53:10.360]   early. Thanks. Yeah. It's interesting, as people internationally, it's about people in Europe and
[01:53:10.360 --> 01:53:15.320]   people in other countries who depend so much on the US for internet connectivity, internet services.
[01:53:15.320 --> 01:53:20.280]   Well, they're furious. Yeah, absolutely. Like you said, my data's being monitored. I'm Canadian. I
[01:53:20.280 --> 01:53:25.400]   don't even have a say in this discussion. Yeah, there's some talk about getting a Nealey Cruz,
[01:53:25.400 --> 01:53:33.880]   the EU's privacy protector. She's great. Absolutely. These are pit bulls.
[01:53:33.880 --> 01:53:38.200]   These are pit bulls. Yeah, pit bulls. And get her involved. But it's going to hurt us. The
[01:53:38.200 --> 01:53:41.640]   Finnish prime minister said this is violation of Finnish law. Absolutely.
[01:53:41.640 --> 01:53:45.480]   Hey, we joke. I don't know if we joke, but we make these flip comments about the year of privacy
[01:53:45.480 --> 01:53:48.760]   is dead. And we joke about Google, you know, knowing everything that we do. But when you see
[01:53:48.760 --> 01:53:53.720]   it made manifest on such a massive scale, I think that's what brings home just how disturbing
[01:53:53.720 --> 01:53:59.960]   this new era really allows people to be. What is it? What do you live in Montreal? What is the
[01:53:59.960 --> 01:54:04.360]   Canadian reaction to this stuff? I mean, the only time Canadians ever took to the streets when
[01:54:04.360 --> 01:54:09.480]   they charge us too much for internet data. We're a markedly self-interested people. But
[01:54:09.480 --> 01:54:15.800]   I think that humans in general, we sacrifice long-term good for short-term gain. And we don't
[01:54:15.800 --> 01:54:20.200]   understand the impact this is going to have going forward in the future. And I think that we
[01:54:20.200 --> 01:54:23.320]   should be paying more attention to this. It scares me. And I don't want to be,
[01:54:23.320 --> 01:54:28.440]   I don't want to be sensationalistic about it. But we already, you know, to some degree of
[01:54:28.440 --> 01:54:33.800]   suspended habeas corpus. All this because we're so scared of terrorism. And I understand the fear.
[01:54:33.800 --> 01:54:38.920]   But we've suspended habeas corpus. We have, which is a, you know, law, I mean, going back to that
[01:54:38.920 --> 01:54:46.920]   magna freaking carda is a long-held tenant of common law. We've started warrantless wiretapping.
[01:54:46.920 --> 01:54:50.360]   It feels to me we are moving. That's why I thought 1984 would be a good book.
[01:54:50.360 --> 01:54:52.040]   Absolutely recommend for audible data.
[01:54:52.040 --> 01:54:53.240]   V for Vendetta.
[01:54:53.240 --> 01:54:54.280]   Yeah, the trial.
[01:54:54.280 --> 01:54:54.680]   Yeah.
[01:54:54.680 --> 01:54:55.560]   Remember, remember.
[01:54:55.560 --> 01:55:00.520]   And we do it under the cloud of secrecy and we do it under the cloud of protection. We do it in
[01:55:00.520 --> 01:55:06.360]   all these ways that are invisible and it just erodes it erodes one step at a time until you no
[01:55:06.360 --> 01:55:07.800]   longer remember what you had.
[01:55:07.800 --> 01:55:16.200]   Well, so I still go back to like whatever compromises we're making between our own privacy and security,
[01:55:16.200 --> 01:55:21.560]   we should have that conversation decide we want them to be. But we're not even having that conversation.
[01:55:21.560 --> 01:55:24.040]   We're not allowed to know what the compromises are in the first place.
[01:55:24.040 --> 01:55:27.000]   We've apparently given them carplosh, which is great.
[01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:29.560]   So it all statements is how freedom ends. Right.
[01:55:29.560 --> 01:55:29.800]   Yeah.
[01:55:29.800 --> 01:55:34.200]   Well, it's sad. I mean, I guess we're all in agreement. I don't know what to say,
[01:55:34.200 --> 01:55:37.480]   except write your member of Congress and fight.
[01:55:37.480 --> 01:55:38.600]   Make it unacceptable.
[01:55:38.600 --> 01:55:40.200]   It's not going to end well.
[01:55:40.200 --> 01:55:42.440]   It's not going to happen.
[01:55:42.440 --> 01:55:47.160]   I mean, like historically, a state school from being liberal to being incredibly fascist and
[01:55:47.160 --> 01:55:51.160]   back and forth. And you just have to make sure that you encounter that wave and splitter as fast as
[01:55:51.160 --> 01:55:51.560]   you can.
[01:55:51.560 --> 01:55:52.040]   Right.
[01:55:53.240 --> 01:55:58.760]   And it makes me nervous for people like Steve. I just worry that when you step over the line,
[01:55:58.760 --> 01:56:01.000]   when do they start hounding you? Absolutely.
[01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:03.000]   You got to become a comedian because they can get away with saying it.
[01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:09.720]   It's just a joke, man. Hey, Tom Merritt is keeping an eye on things we do T&T every Monday through
[01:56:09.720 --> 01:56:16.760]   Friday at 10 a.m. Pacific. That's 1 p.m. Eastern time. 1,800 UTC. It's your daily dose of tech news.
[01:56:16.760 --> 01:56:20.200]   If you like Twit, you'll find out what those stories are each and every day. Let's see what's
[01:56:20.200 --> 01:56:22.040]   coming up in the week ahead, Tom.
[01:56:22.040 --> 01:56:25.240]   Hey, thanks, Leo. Here's a look at some of the things we'll be keeping an eye on in the week ahead
[01:56:25.240 --> 01:56:31.000]   on Tech News today, starting on Monday, June 17th, Bloomberg's next big thing summit kicks off.
[01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:37.880]   Also, some Wikipedia users will start to see the visual editor and Ariel is set to come to Atlanta
[01:56:37.880 --> 01:56:44.440]   for preregistered users only Tuesday, June 18th, Huawei is hosting a beauty event in London and
[01:56:44.440 --> 01:56:49.480]   O'Reilly kicks off velocity in Santa Clara, California. Wednesday, June 19th, it's giga-ohm
[01:56:49.480 --> 01:56:55.400]   structure Thursday, June 20th, Oracle announces their quarterly earnings and Samsung unveils new
[01:56:55.400 --> 01:57:00.760]   Android and Windows devices apparently at Samsung premiere in London Friday, June 21st,
[01:57:00.760 --> 01:57:07.000]   the AT&T folks launch the Galaxy S4 active. Until look at the week ahead, back to you.
[01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:10.280]   I've been wondering, Deedir, if we should cover that Samsung event, do you think that's going to
[01:57:10.280 --> 01:57:15.720]   be anything more than just a new ATV? Well, I thought it was going to be the S4 Zoom, but they'll...
[01:57:15.720 --> 01:57:18.600]   That's the camera. But they've said everything there is to say about it.
[01:57:18.600 --> 01:57:20.120]   Yeah, but I mean, they'll trot that out.
[01:57:20.120 --> 01:57:23.720]   They'll trot it out. That's exactly why we decided... We're stirring Windows weekly,
[01:57:23.720 --> 01:57:27.880]   we'll keep an eye on it. But they've already said everything about this. It's a camera.
[01:57:27.880 --> 01:57:34.360]   And it's kind of like 4-1-2, it's an old version of Android. It's a slow processor. It's not that
[01:57:34.360 --> 01:57:39.960]   exciting. And if they had anything amazing on the ATV line, they should have done it at Computex.
[01:57:39.960 --> 01:57:43.160]   Right. So nothing to see. I'm hoping it's kind of weird.
[01:57:43.160 --> 01:57:46.120]   I always try to judge these ahead of time because then they're going to announce,
[01:57:46.120 --> 01:57:50.600]   "Yes, we've done it." I don't know what. Galaxy S5. Galaxy S5.
[01:57:50.600 --> 01:57:55.080]   You know, we heard you, we decided we want to make it look like an Easter egg, too.
[01:57:55.080 --> 01:57:58.680]   No more plastic. Yeah. You win that being nice. That'd be nice.
[01:57:58.680 --> 01:58:01.880]   Deeter, it's been great having you. Deeter Bonas, a senior editor at The Verge.
[01:58:01.880 --> 01:58:04.840]   You do a podcast there, too. Yeah, we do The Verge Mobile Show.
[01:58:04.840 --> 01:58:09.400]   The Verge Mobile Show. Is it weekly? Yeah. I hear it's very good. Mostly weekly.
[01:58:09.400 --> 01:58:14.680]   I don't have time for podcasts. I hear it's excellent, though. It's nice to have you, Deeter.
[01:58:14.680 --> 01:58:16.200]   Thank you. Come up again, please.
[01:58:16.200 --> 01:58:21.400]   Well, thank Renee Ritchie for being here, as well, from imore.com, crackberry.com,
[01:58:21.400 --> 01:58:25.640]   Android Central. Central, we know it's on Central. Good Lord.
[01:58:25.640 --> 01:58:28.840]   Yeah. When are you going home? I am going home on the Red Eye tonight.
[01:58:28.840 --> 01:58:30.360]   Oh, well, thank you for staying with us. Well, thank you for your attention.
[01:58:30.360 --> 01:58:33.640]   Tomorrow morning, we're launching Talk Mobile Apps, and you were kind enough to do a segment with
[01:58:33.640 --> 01:58:35.960]   us, and that'll be up on Wednesday. Good. Yeah.
[01:58:35.960 --> 01:58:38.920]   Wednesday, and what's the website for that? It's going to be up all week. It's going to be Talk Mobile
[01:58:38.920 --> 01:58:44.520]   2013.com. Talk Mobile 2013. It's all about apps. Cool. Tweet me
[01:58:44.520 --> 01:58:49.560]   and I'll tweet tweet it out to the world. We did, by the way, and I'm meaning to tweet Jason Silva's
[01:58:49.560 --> 01:58:54.840]   interview on triangulation this week. Boy, is he, and you know who that is? He's a character.
[01:58:54.840 --> 01:59:00.600]   YouTube.com/shotsofaw. And it's a worth seeing that triangulation if you didn't see that.
[01:59:00.600 --> 01:59:06.600]   It's at twit.tv/tri, a very interesting guy who is very bullish about the future.
[01:59:06.600 --> 01:59:11.880]   So if all his NSA stuff has brought you down, watch a little shot of awe and you'll feel much.
[01:59:11.880 --> 01:59:18.120]   You have to love the future, Leo. The future's bright. It's just these intervals in between
[01:59:18.120 --> 01:59:21.800]   where the bad guys, sometimes they get a little ahead. We humans don't mess it up. Humans,
[01:59:21.800 --> 01:59:26.680]   we're going to win in the long run. Put your faith in humans. Yes. Gene Hackman will save us.
[01:59:26.680 --> 01:59:33.080]   Did you see Manas deal yet? Not yet. I'm holding it off. It's interesting. Yes.
[01:59:33.080 --> 01:59:38.200]   Long. Yes. It's not my Superman, but it turns into Transformers at the end. Yes.
[01:59:38.200 --> 01:59:42.840]   But other than that, if you cut that part off, it's great. You will like it. I've seen it.
[01:59:42.840 --> 01:59:46.600]   Oh, you saw it. Yes. I have reservations about the ending.
[01:59:46.600 --> 01:59:49.320]   Yeah, it just goes on and on. Well, no. I mean, well, we can talk about it.
[01:59:49.320 --> 01:59:55.480]   Oh, it's talking with no spoilers. Although he's 33 years old, he comes out like this.
[01:59:55.480 --> 01:59:58.600]   There's a little bit of Christian iconography going on. Not as much as Superman returns,
[01:59:58.600 --> 02:00:01.960]   but quite a bit. Well, quite a bit. I guess Superman has always been a god-like figure.
[02:00:04.120 --> 02:00:10.600]   There is that one thing where the bad guy says, "We are evolution. Evolution always wins in the end."
[02:00:10.600 --> 02:00:14.040]   And then he punches him in the nose. My favorite part, and this is...
[02:00:14.040 --> 02:00:21.560]   My favorite part is the bad guy messages the world on television. He's coming in through RSS.
[02:00:21.560 --> 02:00:26.520]   On a Nokia phone. Yes. What? Yes. No. No. No. No. No. He's taking over the RSS.
[02:00:26.520 --> 02:00:30.440]   That is the funniest thing. They get all the TV sets saying, "We are. You're not alone."
[02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:34.680]   And all the radios and everything. And then it's on the Windows Nokia,
[02:00:34.680 --> 02:00:37.320]   Lumi and I play it. How you know it's a fantasy because everyone has Nokia phones.
[02:00:37.320 --> 02:00:41.720]   Everyone does. Everyone has Nokia phones. And it says, and she says,
[02:00:41.720 --> 02:00:48.680]   she's coming in on RSS. Wow. He really is powerful. I thank God Google protected us.
[02:00:48.680 --> 02:00:54.440]   He brought Google Reader back. Yes. That's power. You would think General Zod could figure out
[02:00:54.440 --> 02:01:00.760]   how to get a new video. Michael Shannon. Great. Very good. Yes. You know, really wonderful.
[02:01:00.760 --> 02:01:05.400]   And that's a tough role, General Zod. Look at who you was playing it last time.
[02:01:05.400 --> 02:01:09.400]   Exactly. You're in stamp. The king of bad guys. All right, enough of that.
[02:01:09.400 --> 02:01:11.480]   This isn't the film show. What do you talk about? It's a big man of steel.
[02:01:11.480 --> 02:01:19.720]   It's not last night. Do they have this in Canada D-box? No. So stupid. It's a seat that moves.
[02:01:19.720 --> 02:01:24.520]   Yeah, we have those. We call it super ATV or something. So you're watching and the seats
[02:01:24.520 --> 02:01:29.560]   go like this. Yes. And vibrating and I don't think you come up with something worse than 3D.
[02:01:29.560 --> 02:01:33.880]   Yeah. But they have. Yeah. I'm glad to see they don't have in our in Petaluma,
[02:01:33.880 --> 02:01:38.200]   they're not it's not allowed. You can't mix 3D and D-box because you'd vomit. I went to 2D.
[02:01:38.200 --> 02:01:42.200]   I'm only ever going to 2D. 2D. That's it. Thank you everybody for being here. We do
[02:01:42.200 --> 02:01:49.240]   Twitter on Sunday after the tech guy 3PM Pacific 6PM Eastern time. Oh, Chad's giving me a little hint.
[02:01:49.240 --> 02:01:55.880]   He's dropping a little hint. I wonder what it could be. Oh, our E3 coverage is on the Twitch
[02:01:55.880 --> 02:02:04.600]   specials. Episode 162, go to twit.tv/specials. Lamar Wilson and Chad and and Snubs was down there
[02:02:04.600 --> 02:02:10.520]   with you and they covered the E3 in such a beautiful. They were awesome. It was fun. It was a lot of fun.
[02:02:10.520 --> 02:02:15.720]   What was your favorite game, Chad? What did you get excited about anything? Oh my gosh. I would
[02:02:15.720 --> 02:02:20.520]   have to say people freaked out over Kingdom Hearts. I mean, oh, that's going to be a good one. That's
[02:02:20.520 --> 02:02:23.800]   the Gamester game, right? No, no. That's the Disney game.
[02:02:23.800 --> 02:02:31.560]   Disney. Close. All right. And I just Dean makes a guest appearance and all that. I really want to
[02:02:31.560 --> 02:02:36.120]   thank Trey Radcliffe from StuckInCustoms.com for joining us. Russ Pitts, my old friend from Tech
[02:02:36.120 --> 02:02:41.560]   TV, who is now the guy in charge of Polygon.com for joining us earlier in the show. Thank you for
[02:02:41.560 --> 02:02:46.280]   joining us and we will see you next time. Another Twit. He's in the can. Thank you everybody.
[02:02:46.280 --> 02:03:01.880]   Now the process of tripling your internet speed is not very difficult at all. The first thing
[02:03:01.880 --> 02:03:07.080]   you have to do is grab your internet and find the end. He looks respectable and he's on the internet.
[02:03:07.080 --> 02:03:13.160]   I trust him. He's going to tape batteries to his cable. The battery about three inches from the
[02:03:13.160 --> 02:03:17.880]   end in either direction. This is so infinite. It's an important thing to use electrical tape
[02:03:17.880 --> 02:03:24.200]   because it conducts electricity. Here's the first battery. After you have the first battery on.
[02:03:24.200 --> 02:03:28.280]   So this is a joke, right? You need to find the second end of the cable. No, no, I'm sure it works.
[02:03:28.280 --> 02:03:34.280]   We should try it. He doesn't speed test at the end. Same direction towards the end. So, for example,
[02:03:34.280 --> 02:03:40.760]   the positive side looks credible. The end of this side of the cable. So the positive side must be
[02:03:40.760 --> 02:03:45.960]   facing the end of this cable side. So we're going to do the same thing using the electrical tape.
[02:03:45.960 --> 02:03:51.240]   Now you have a cable with one battery on each end. It may look strange but I'm going to explain
[02:03:51.240 --> 02:03:55.240]   it shortly. If you have two more batteries, you could add them further down the line.
[02:03:55.240 --> 02:04:00.760]   This is no different than baseball players wearing magic magnetic ropes around their back.
