[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.520]   This week in tech, I'm Jason Snell sitting in for Leo Laporte.
[00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.000]   We got a lot of Apple news this week from the World Wide Developers Conference in San
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.280]   Jose, plus a little bit about Amazon versus Walmart.
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.880]   We got some bad news from Uber, what else is new, and maybe a feud between Taylor Swift
[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.640]   and Katy Perry?
[00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.640]   We'll find a tech angle.
[00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:20.640]   Next on Twitch.

[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.160]   Welcome back.
[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.400]   I am not Leo Laporte that much is obvious.
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.920]   I am your guest host Jason Snell.
[00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.160]   Leo is gallivanting around south of the equator.
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.500]   Of course he's always like eight moves ahead of the rest of us knowing that Apple's developer
[00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.440]   conference would be this week.
[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.880]   He decided to get the guy who's the editor at Macworld for more than a decade to guest
[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.760]   host for him because we'll talk a little bit of Apple but we'll also talk Uber.
[00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:31.760]   Maybe some Amazon.
[00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.400]   A little bit of Taylor Swift if you're very good at the very end.
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.720]   And who knows what else might happen.
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.920]   Let me introduce my wonderful guests who are with me as I take the helm from Leo for this
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.320]   week's TWIT.
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.080]   Lisa Schmeiser is here.
[00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:50.560]   She is the editor at the Windows Super site and a good friend from way back.
[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:51.560]   One of my former co-workers.
[00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:52.560]   Hi Lisa.
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.560]   Welcome.
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:54.560]   Hi.
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.560]   It's a pleasure to be here.
[00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.160]   And another former colleague of mine, the great days at IDG Harry McCracken, who now
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.160]   at Fast Company.
[00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.160]   Hi Harry.
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.160]   Jason, good to be here.
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.120]   It's great to have you both in studio and remotely across the Skype in her webs.
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.080]   It's Micah Sargent from iMore.
[00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.080]   Hi Micah.
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.080]   Hello.
[00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.360]   Sadly not former colleagues.
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.560]   Certainly colleagues now.
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.560]   We are.
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.640]   Are you sad that we're not not colleagues anymore?
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:18.640]   Wait a second.
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.920]   No, no, I'm happy to be here.
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:21.920]   Okay, good.
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:22.920]   That's a relief.
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.720]   Boy, secret's coming out here on TWIT.
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:25.720]   All right.
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.440]   Again, the big news this week.
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.240]   And I would feel more guilty about like pumping up the Apple news this week given my background.
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:37.080]   If we're not one of the best, if not the best week for Apple news of the entire year,
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.480]   maybe the iPhone week's a little bit better.
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:39.480]   But it's close.
[00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.400]   Apple's worldwide developer conference was in San Jose, California this week.
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.720]   Started off with a keynote on Monday, continued throughout the week.
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.240]   Lots of other side events going on.
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:52.960]   It was a two, almost two and a half hour, two, our 20 minute long keynote that was packed
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:53.960]   full.
[00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:56.720]   I have it on good authority that the first draft of the keynote was well over three hours
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.960]   and they actually cut a lot of stuff out and announced some stuff in advance.
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:03.440]   There's still a huge amount of stuff that they dealt with this week.
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.360]   And we're going to talk about it a little bit.
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.440]   Most interesting perhaps a brand new product.
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.220]   There are a couple products that aren't even going to ship until December, but Apple pre-announced
[00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.600]   them, which they very rarely do with products unless they have a product in a brand new
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:20.360]   category like the HomePod, which is Apple's answer packed with Siri power apparently,
[00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.200]   although we didn't hear it.
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:27.360]   It's Apple's answer to the Amazon Echo and also the Google Home and that Cortana speaker
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.280]   that Microsoft is doing with Harman Carden and smart speakers, right?
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.560]   This is the Apple smart speaker.
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:34.560]   I heard it.
[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.880]   So I got to say that, yeah, it sounded pretty good.
[00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.400]   You couldn't touch it and you couldn't talk to it.
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:40.400]   Those were not allowed.
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.520]   So I can only say that I heard it and it sounded pretty good.
[00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:44.520]   Harry, Harry, did you?
[00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.400]   Do not gaze upon it directly.
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.520]   Were you one of the few who was allowed to hear but not touch the HomePod?
[00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:51.520]   Yes.
[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:52.520]   I heard that.
[00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:57.040]   We had some questions which they said were good questions, but not ones they were going
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.480]   to answer right then.
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:59.480]   Yeah.
[00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:00.480]   Yeah.
[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:05.400]   You had a similar experience to me, which was where we know what we know from the keynote.
[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.560]   And if you ask them questions, they said, "Well, remember the keynote?"
[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:09.640]   And that was about it.
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.080]   So that's what they did literally.
[00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.080]   That's a great question.
[00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.080]   Moving on.
[00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.080]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:19.480]   So I would say that Apple has now entered this fray, but they haven't.
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.560]   They've said their intention to enter the fray in six months.
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.800]   Micah, what's your take on the HomePod compared to you?
[00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.800]   I know you follow this Home automation stuff closely.
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.440]   I know you have opinions about this.
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:29.440]   Let's start with you.
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.400]   What's your take on Apple's take on the connected speaker category?
[00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.280]   I certainly do have some thoughts.
[00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:42.360]   I think that the problem is my whole opinion and feels are based on the rumors that took
[00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:43.600]   place.
[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:48.240]   And so because of that, I ended up being pretty disappointed by the HomePod that came out
[00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:55.720]   because I was expecting this really cool in-home home assistant that was kind of going to
[00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:00.800]   take on Amazon's Echo and Google's home device.
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:07.040]   And instead, what we got was a Sonos-like product that seems to be competing in the
[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.240]   premium audio space.
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.840]   And yeah, it seems like it's going to do just that.
[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:14.040]   It's going to work with AirPlay.
[00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.040]   And that's great.
[00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:21.240]   And it's got acoustic fibers all over the outside that look like Spider-Man had a moment.
[00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:26.760]   But I'm not impressed as what it ultimately boils down to.
[00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:30.480]   And maybe that's the fault of the different sites out there that were telling me that
[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:34.360]   this was going to be Apple's Amazon Echo.
[00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:39.440]   But it just is a speaker that happens to have Siri.
[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:42.600]   And really what they cared about and what they were talking about was the seven tweeter
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:48.280]   array system and the custom designed subwoofer, which was not the stuff that I was interested
[00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:49.280]   in at least.
[00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:52.720]   Were you disappointed because you were kind of hoping that there would be a more sort
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:57.040]   of low cost, lower quality thing like the Echo rather than having to make basically a
[00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:59.920]   Sonos with Siri in it?
[00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:04.640]   Yeah, and I don't even know if lower quality is the right.
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:08.240]   I mean, it would have had to be because it would have been lower cost, of course.
[00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:15.440]   But I wanted to see them focus more on a device that could be this smart assistant that offers
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:21.480]   up some kind of the stuff that Google and Amazon are looking into now, which is a smart
[00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:27.080]   assistant that is aware of what's going on and also aware of what you want to do in a
[00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:28.080]   home.
[00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:32.920]   And then you can light up and say, the lights are basically giving a hint that there's something
[00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:33.960]   that it wants to tell you.
[00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:34.960]   You ask it, what's up?
[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:38.160]   And it's like, hey, did you know that the traffic is really bad right now?
[00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:42.920]   So you should probably leave in the next five minutes or notifications that pop up and can
[00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:47.840]   let you know about calendar appointments or flight cancellations or things like that.
[00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:49.800]   And that's not at all what it is.
[00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:53.880]   And it's the same thing applies to like being proactive in the home where it always knows
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:59.920]   that at like 8 p.m., I end up shutting off the lights in a certain room and I walk into
[00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:03.400]   the kitchen and want to have a cup of coffee or something like that.
[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:08.680]   If it starts to learn that kind of thing and get better at being an active automator
[00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:13.040]   for my home, those were the things that I was hoping Apple was going to focus on.
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:17.080]   But instead they were focused on check out this really expensive speaker that's going
[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:20.560]   to sound so good and you only have to buy two of them and then it's going to fill your
[00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.360]   entire house with sound.
[00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:24.080]   I don't really need or want that.
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:26.920]   And I'm sure there's somebody out there that does.
[00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:32.280]   But it seems like the Echo and the Google Home are pretty popular and Google's Chromecast
[00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:37.600]   system are pretty popular and they seem to be focused more on the proactive type of
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:38.600]   thing.
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:39.600]   So.
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:44.040]   Harry, what does it say about the fact that Apple put Siri kind of in the background in
[00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:45.040]   this product?
[00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:49.960]   It's there and they talked about it on a couple of slides but they didn't demo it with Siri.
[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:50.960]   We never saw that.
[00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:52.320]   We talked about assistant features.
[00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:56.160]   It really is sort of, at least in the marketing, a secondary feature of this product.
[00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:00.880]   I think they were very careful about their messaging and that most likely reflects the
[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:08.080]   fact that Amazon has a huge head start making Echo well-tuned for this use case scenario
[00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:13.200]   and Google with the Google Assistant on Google Home also has a head start and Apple needs
[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:14.720]   more time to do that.
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:19.440]   And my guess is that they didn't not talk about that because they're not going to do
[00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:20.440]   that.
[00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:24.360]   They just didn't talk about that because you would be immediately comparing what Siri
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:30.840]   can do right now to what Echo can do with Google and what Google Assistant can do.
[00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:34.120]   And they just need a little bit more time to put that together.
[00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:40.080]   And by not telling you to compare them right now, you think about it in competition to
[00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:44.080]   Sonos, which is a much less intimidating competitor for a company like Apple.
[00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:49.200]   And if it was only a Sonos-like device, the fact that it's from Apple and support Siri
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:50.480]   would be intriguing to a lot of people.
[00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:54.320]   And we should say, because I don't think I mentioned it up top, it's $349, which just
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:58.880]   to pat myself on the back, before the event I thought what would it cost and my thought
[00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:03.000]   was $299, then I added $50 and predicted it would be $349.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   And I got it right.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.920]   So this is the thing, add to the price if you're predicting an Apple price.
[00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:10.960]   Lisa, do you have a take on the HomePod?
[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:15.360]   I think it's Apple tipping its hand that it's beginning to reposition itself away from computers
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:20.320]   as a market and more as a luxury consumer device maker or a luxury consumer goods maker in
[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:22.400]   general.
[00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:25.840]   To me, it spoke volumes during the keynote that we had a lot of attention paid to the
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:26.840]   watch.
[00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:30.120]   We had a lot of attention paid to the phone.
[00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:35.560]   We didn't have a whole lot paid to the experience of computing using Apple as a platform.
[00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:41.080]   And with the HomePod, it seems like what they're saying is we will build very nice,
[00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:45.760]   almost single-use appliances for you and we've decided to go after audio files because
[00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:50.160]   audio files are willing to spend money on hardware.
[00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:55.640]   I think what they probably suspect is that people who have this will also have an Amazon
[00:10:55.640 --> 00:11:00.160]   Echo because Echo's already got a head start in the market.
[00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:05.560]   More critically, Echo streams a lot more musical services than this will.
[00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:10.360]   And you really can't discount the loyalty that people are going to have to Spotify or
[00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:14.560]   to Pandora or iHeartRadio or what have you.
[00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:19.240]   I was talking to some friends that speak about streaming music services and they have
[00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:23.920]   really talked themselves into, oh, it's totally worth paying $10 a month even if I already
[00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:27.960]   own the CDs because I like that I can load this onto my phone and play it at the gym.
[00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:31.880]   I like that I can play this in the car, so on and so forth.
[00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:37.200]   So I think putting this in the same product category as the Google Home and the Amazon
[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:38.360]   Echo may not be the right thing.
[00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:43.760]   I think Apple is trying to stake out a slightly different consumer take.
[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:47.320]   And so this way, if things do not work out with Siri or they do not nail down their home
[00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:51.240]   automation strategy, they can be, no, it was always audio all the time.
[00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:55.640]   Yeah, I think it is interesting that this is an Apple music product through and through,
[00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:59.960]   which is not too surprising but at a first cut for the first generation of a product
[00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:03.520]   when who knows how many they're going to be able to make, there is an argument to be made
[00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:08.200]   just like the first iPod was, had Firewire on it and it only worked on the Mac that if
[00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:11.040]   it goes really well, perhaps they have the option to open it up.
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:15.440]   But for now, I mean, it is for people who want a nice sounding connected speaker that
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:16.960]   works with Apple Music.
[00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:23.520]   That said, I did just buy the Amazon Music Unlimited for my one Echo.
[00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:26.840]   I just bought that because I was playing so much music on it that even though I don't
[00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:30.760]   subscribe to their service, I threw them some money because I wanted the convenience of
[00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:34.320]   it and you know, that would be the alternative is you really want this and maybe you switched
[00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:35.320]   Apple Music to do it.
[00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:36.320]   I don't know how likely that is.
[00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:41.720]   The thing that current concerns me slightly is that Apple, one of their historic strengths
[00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:45.160]   has been that they managed to define user expectations and user experiences for product
[00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:50.640]   categories because they helped adopt digital music by making it virtually frictionless
[00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:52.680]   to download and buy.
[00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:55.680]   You know, they jump started smartphones.
[00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:58.640]   You could argue they've become the leading vendor for smart watches.
[00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:03.520]   They basically set the standard for how experiences go and I wonder if they're trying to do that
[00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:08.960]   again here or if they've badly misread how people already have integrated experiences
[00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:13.000]   like streaming music and smart home assistance into daily life.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.960]   I think that the fact that they chose the name HomePod might be meaningful because it
[00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:20.080]   can mean music if you want it to mean music.
[00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:22.200]   It can also mean almost anything else.
[00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:28.760]   If this product is around for the long haul, they're not going to be defined by a name
[00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:32.000]   like Apple High-Fi years ago.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.920]   Now, Jason, you said that you got the Amazon Music Unlimited service.
[00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:39.760]   Did you get the one specific to Echo that costs less because it's just for Echo or did
[00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:40.760]   you go all in?
[00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:45.560]   No, I got the one just for my little lady and a canister who sits on my kitchen counter
[00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:47.200]   because that's the only place I really...
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:52.320]   That was where my wife and my kids were shouting, "Play this song," and being told, "Here's
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:55.440]   a 32nd sample," which is the worst thing in the world.
[00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:58.080]   So a fine, okay, $4 a month or whatever it is.
[00:13:58.080 --> 00:13:59.080]   That's what I'm doing.
[00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:01.440]   Yeah, and I think that's...
[00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:04.120]   Lise, you touched on the fact that people are kind of...
[00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:07.400]   They pick a music service and they kind of stick to it.
[00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:12.160]   And Sonos offers Apple Music as one of its streaming services.
[00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:18.240]   Of course, the Amazon Echo does not inherently have that, but it's interesting that Apple
[00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:23.920]   is only going to be offering this, as well as AirPlay 2, which you can use to stream whatever
[00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:25.800]   happens to be streaming on your iOS device.
[00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:32.720]   But I got to thinking about the fact that I don't only have people who have iOS devices
[00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:37.600]   coming to my home, and maybe they have a podcast that they want me to listen to or something
[00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:42.200]   that is not available on Apple Music, and they want to be able to stream that in the
[00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:45.720]   home, they can't use AirPlay 2.
[00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:47.600]   And so suddenly, we've got this...
[00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:51.880]   I have this $350 speaker that won't work for them and I'm trying to figure out some
[00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:52.880]   way.
[00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:56.520]   So, for me, you're loaded up on my computer and then I'll play it over AirPlay 2.
[00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:58.480]   And that's frustrating.
[00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:03.720]   I have an article that I put together that kind of compares the AirPod and Sonos, and
[00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:08.160]   then one that also compares the AirPod to the Google Home and the Amazon Echo device.
[00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:13.080]   And it's really interesting whenever you look at the different streaming services that they
[00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:19.360]   offer, because Sonos has a Bajillion-D, and both the Amazon Echo and Google Home have
[00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:24.720]   a Bajillion-D as well, and then Amazon Echo right now lets you stream over Bluetooth,
[00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:29.720]   which is incredibly open, and Google Home is offering that very soon.
[00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:31.400]   So there's going to be Bluetooth there as well.
[00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:38.160]   So it's a little frustrating that the HomePod, even if we're just going to look at this strictly
[00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:43.920]   as this wonderful music streaming device, it's only going to let you do it over Apple
[00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:49.760]   Music itself or over AirPlay 2, and if you don't have the proper devices for that, then
[00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:54.240]   I don't know, we shrug or say, "Go talk to the Echo that I also do have in my living
[00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:55.240]   room."
[00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:59.720]   I mean, to be fair, I think what Amazon and Google are trying to do is target everybody
[00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:02.040]   with the product, and Apple very clearly isn't.
[00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:06.840]   And I think that's within their rights as a company that makes products to say, "This
[00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:09.760]   is our product for people in our ecosystem who use Apple Music.
[00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:12.600]   We have complete control over every aspect of it."
[00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:16.240]   And if you want to play Apple Music in your house, we've got it.
[00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:19.800]   Or if you want to do streaming music in your house, we have a complete solution, our service,
[00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:21.160]   our hardware.
[00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:24.760]   The challenge is like, "Is this all Apple is interested in doing?
[00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:27.640]   I can hear my inner Andy and not co-speaking now."
[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:31.240]   Which is, "Is that all Apple really wants is to capture the people who are completely
[00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:33.280]   inside their ecosystem?
[00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:38.320]   Or do they want to compete with the other products in this category and have it be a
[00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:41.120]   level playing field where other services can be on there?"
[00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:45.320]   It seems like for now that that answer is no, that this is about people who really are
[00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:47.320]   deep down in the ecosystem.
[00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:49.320]   And I'm sure this will be a great product for those people.
[00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:54.600]   I'd love to see the research that breaks out spending potential by people who are, as
[00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:59.040]   you put it, deep in the ecosystem compared to a broader, wider audience.
[00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:03.160]   Because if somebody at Apple has run the numbers and said, "It's going to be way too
[00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:08.600]   much work for us to make the licensing agreements and put together seamless technology that
[00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:11.960]   does what St. Michael wants to do," where your friend comes over and says, "I want you
[00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:15.800]   to listen to this podcast," they're like, "Nah, it's not worth it.
[00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:19.560]   We can make more money with less effort just with this narrow audience segment."
[00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:21.360]   I'd love to see if there are numbers that back that up.
[00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:24.680]   I'll remind you, too, this product is Siri-driven.
[00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:27.920]   So I wonder how much of this is strategy of no, it's only Apple Music, or how much of
[00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:30.120]   this strategy is we can't do anything else.
[00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:35.040]   Because Siri on your iPhone can't control Spotify either.
[00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:41.520]   And nor did in iOS 11 Apple make any announcements that they might add that to the Siri kit functionality
[00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:43.360]   that they introduced last year.
[00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:47.320]   They would have to do a whole lot of new functionality that doesn't currently exist on any of their
[00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:49.960]   platforms to let other services in the door.
[00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:53.400]   But you've touched on a really fundamental irritation with digital assistance, is that
[00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:56.200]   right now they're also fairly strongly siloed.
[00:17:56.200 --> 00:18:01.280]   For example, on my phone, I prefer to use the Gmail app over the mail app.
[00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:04.560]   I like how I can sort and prioritize my mail.
[00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:08.800]   And just as an experiment today as I was driving, I said, "Hey Siri, look up an email from Tonya
[00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:11.200]   Hall so I can find the address to this place."
[00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:13.360]   And so I was like, "I can't go into Gmail.
[00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:16.680]   Would you like to download your mail app so I can go into that?"
[00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:21.040]   And I thought, "What is the point of having an assistant if I can't have it go through
[00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:22.520]   all of my digital assets?"
[00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:25.560]   Because as a user, I don't really care about brand loyalty.
[00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:28.960]   What I care about is the aggregation of data that I consider to be attached to me and what
[00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:30.120]   I want to do.
[00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:34.760]   And I want to be able to access and manipulate that data independent of platform, app, or
[00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:35.760]   device.
[00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:36.760]   So I don't care about the siloing.
[00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:41.560]   It's always dangerous to predict what Apple is going to do with something.
[00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:48.640]   That said, I don't see why they wouldn't not want to do essentially what a lot of their
[00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:53.280]   other devices do, which is to cater both to people who are completely in the ecosystem.
[00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:57.480]   But also to people who like to live outside a little bit.
[00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:01.560]   Coming back at the iPhone, that was a closed platform for the first year.
[00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:05.640]   And a year later, they realized they could keep everything they had from being a closed
[00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:10.360]   platform or almost everything, plus make it far more powerful by reaching out to people.
[00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:16.920]   And I also feel like it's just pretty clear that these smart speakers are at least potentially
[00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:22.560]   a vastly larger market than they are even right now.
[00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:26.880]   And Apple can't compete if it has something that only aspires to be a really nice device
[00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:28.680]   for listening to its own music service.
[00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:29.680]   Right.
[00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:34.440]   Is the HomePod a device that's intended to induce people to subscribe to Apple Music?
[00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:36.360]   Or is it a product that they want to shell?
[00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:41.600]   And ultimately, they want to sell it to people who use Spotify or Amazon Music or even the
[00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:45.960]   Google streaming music service as long as they can sell HomePods maybe in the end there.
[00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:48.600]   I would imagine that that's ultimately what their vision is going to be.
[00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:49.760]   Man, if I'm Pandora, I'm more than honest.
[00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:56.080]   I would really hope because it would be disappointing if this is genuinely just supposed to be,
[00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:57.440]   you know, a way to listen to music.
[00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:01.880]   And one of the things too, like, is a lot of enabled devices.
[00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:04.640]   And I'm sorry, I've just triggered everyone's echoes.
[00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:12.800]   But those enabled devices can now hook up with your iCloud account to add calendar events
[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:16.320]   and to, I think, what is it, calendar and reminders or something like that?
[00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:18.200]   I know calendar for sure.
[00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:23.480]   And so Amazon, it really is paying attention to this and trying to be the every person's
[00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:26.360]   smart speaker and every person's smart assistant.
[00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:27.360]   And I appreciate that.
[00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:32.640]   And they've opened up a cell on device so that you can use that whether you're running
[00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:34.800]   iOS or Android.
[00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:42.680]   And I think that they are really what I want to see Apple do because I do enjoy, you know,
[00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:48.960]   the hardware that Apple puts out and I would be happy to have a, you know, Spider-Man web
[00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:51.240]   covered device that sounds really good.
[00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:57.400]   But also can do all the things that I know Amazon's voice assistant can do.
[00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:03.440]   And that's where I guess I end up being a little bit disappointed in this version one.
[00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:09.320]   But as people across the interwebs have reminded me, this is just a version one and it's not
[00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:13.240]   even supposed to be out until December and we could see some more stuff come to it.
[00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:20.440]   But yeah, when you look at the smart assistant marketplace or the ecosystem at least, the
[00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:24.720]   Siri still is pretty closed off.
[00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:28.160]   And yes, Siri is in a bunch of different languages and that is awesome.
[00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:33.400]   And I'm glad that, you know, Siri can be spoke to in those different languages.
[00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:39.400]   But also selfishly, I wanted to have a little bit more built in that allows me to connect
[00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:43.400]   to different types of apps and things like that that I use.
[00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:45.960]   Yeah, I guess it is true.
[00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:47.800]   This is a product that doesn't come out for six months.
[00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:50.520]   This is a product that is going to be a first cut at it.
[00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:54.120]   It may be indeed that Apple needs to start somewhere and this is where it starts and
[00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:55.560]   it goes from here.
[00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:59.360]   The expectations in Apple are always so high at this point that everything gets scrutinized.
[00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:01.600]   Everybody is disappointed when it isn't for everyone.
[00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:06.440]   But at the same time, I think the questions that you ask are really relevant.
[00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:10.160]   I also want to point out I don't believe Twitch's policy is to bleep out the names
[00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:11.400]   of the trigger words.
[00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:14.200]   So I want to apologize for, do you bleep them out?
[00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:16.120]   Oh, they do believe them out.
[00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:20.600]   Well, that's excellent because I was going to say I'm sorry that Micah said, I'm sorry
[00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:27.120]   that Harry said, he really said, but hey, it's going to be okay.
[00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:28.120]   Hold it.
[00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:29.800]   No, it goes mine.
[00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:31.840]   I've ruined everything now.
[00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:36.240]   I feel like, I feel like, like Leo is going to swoop in and save me.
[00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:40.120]   And he is because it's time to take a break and hear about our first sponsor.
[00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:42.440]   We'll be right back with more of Twitch and just a bit.
[00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:48.880]   Our show today brought to you by WordPress, my new web host and my old web host.
[00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:54.320]   I've run a WordPress site since the early 2000s, right when they first started.
[00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:55.320]   I love WordPress.
[00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:57.560]   I've been with WordPress for so long.
[00:22:57.560 --> 00:23:01.560]   And I'm really happy to be back on WordPress, but this time with the hosted solution with
[00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:04.280]   WordPress.com.
[00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:05.800]   They do all the work.
[00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:07.880]   They do all the security updates.
[00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:11.800]   They provide you with support, great support from their happiness team.
[00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:13.480]   It is a really great company.
[00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:15.480]   I'm so happy to be on WordPress.com.
[00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:18.240]   They have a variety of plans for whatever your needs.
[00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:22.120]   I have a business site, which means I've got all the business templates.
[00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:26.520]   I get all sorts of features, business needs, but it's great for a blog.
[00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:28.960]   It's great for anything you're doing a website for.
[00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:35.880]   In fact, increasingly, I feel like if everybody should have a website, and I'll tell you why.
[00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:40.920]   If you don't have a website, you're not in control of what information appears about
[00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:42.560]   you on the web.
[00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:48.080]   But if you have your own website, you're setting the standard for somebody who looks up your
[00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:50.040]   name, they're going to find that.
[00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:54.120]   They're more likely to find it if you're on WordPress.com because WordPress has great
[00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:55.120]   SEO.
[00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:56.120]   They do the site maps.
[00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:59.200]   They do everything you need to make your site a success.
[00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:01.080]   And they have a great community.
[00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:04.960]   I can't tell you how much traffic I get just from the WordPress.com community.
[00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:08.240]   I have half a million followers at WordPress.com.
[00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:09.920]   I don't know where that came from.
[00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:11.960]   It's so cool.
[00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:14.400]   And of course, WordPress makes it really easy to set up your site.
[00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:15.400]   I chose a template.
[00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:16.400]   I like 2017.
[00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:18.120]   That's the one I use.
[00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:19.120]   Really slick.
[00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:25.720]   I can have all the widgets with importing my Instagram on there, my Twitter on there.
[00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:28.720]   It's also because WordPress has been a standard for so long.
[00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:31.640]   It's so easy to hook up third party blogging tools.
[00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:36.000]   Of course, WordPress has great apps for your phone, for your operating system.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:43.360]   I mean, it's just, you know, because when some WordPress powers 27% of all the websites
[00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:45.680]   in the world, 27%.
[00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:52.800]   So by being so popular, there's great support for WordPress in so many different areas.
[00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:56.880]   So if you even, if you have no experience building a website, WordPress can really help
[00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:57.880]   you do it.
[00:24:57.880 --> 00:25:02.000]   And of course, there's great WordPress experts who will help you create the best-looking
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   site you've ever seen.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:07.280]   Hundreds of themes built in SEO, social sharing.
[00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:11.960]   I can go on and on, but what I want you to do is go to WordPress.com/twit and set up
[00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:13.320]   your first site.
[00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:20.960]   You get 15% off any new plan purchase at WordPress.com/twit.
[00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:23.120]   While you're there, check out my site at leoloport.com.
[00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:24.760]   I'm pretty proud of it.
[00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:30.680]   WordPress.com/twit, 15% off on your brand new website.
[00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:32.680]   I just, you know, I love WordPress.
[00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:37.200]   I've been a fan of them forever and I'm really glad to have them on the show.
[00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:39.560]   So thank you WordPress for your support.
[00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:41.360]   WordPress.com/twit.
[00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:44.520]   Now back to the show, Jason.
[00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:46.080]   Thank you, Leo.
[00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:50.840]   The spectral form of Leo Laport hovers over Twit always, even when he is.
[00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:52.000]   It's not a ghost.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   He's fine.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   He's just also, he's like Dr. Strange.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.800]   He has a spectral form, an astral form, if you will.
[00:25:56.800 --> 00:26:01.720]   Welcome back to Twit Live, not the Leo version.
[00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:08.000]   I have wonderful guests here, Lisa Schmeiser, Harry McCracken, Michael Sargent.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.160]   Let's talk a little more Apple.
[00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:11.800]   I swear it's not going to be all Apple, but there is a lot of Apple I'm mixing some other
[00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:12.800]   stuff as we go.
[00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:17.000]   But the other, what, from my money, the other exciting thing that happened, the most exciting
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:25.280]   thing at WWDC this week, was Apple's embrace of using the iPad as a real bonafide computer
[00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:26.680]   in a way that it hasn't.
[00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:31.640]   It took some steps in this direction a couple of years ago, but the new 10.5-inch iPad Pro
[00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:36.080]   and updated to a .9-inch iPad Pro, which is actually the .9.
[00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:40.000]   Harry and I both have them on the table right now.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:46.440]   And iOS 11, which has huge software features to make these devices feel much more at ease
[00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:51.080]   when it comes to multitasking and moving data between apps and all these things that have
[00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:53.720]   traditionally been very hard to do on iOS.
[00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:55.160]   So I'm excited about it.
[00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:56.840]   Harry, you're an iPad Pro user, obviously.
[00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:58.160]   How are you feeling about all of this?
[00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:03.920]   Well, it was an emotional rollercoaster because during the keynote, they did their iOS 11 segment
[00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:05.520]   and barely mentioned the iPad.
[00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:07.000]   I was really worried.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:10.440]   And then they announced the new iPads and then all of a sudden they came back and did
[00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:15.200]   a sizable chunk on the iPad-specific features, which included it.
[00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:17.960]   A reasonably high percentage of the things I want, not all of them.
[00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:24.680]   I still want to be able to select a different web browser as my default browser, for instance.
[00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:30.360]   But it does look like they pulled off making it a lot more powerful without just cloning
[00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:32.200]   how stuff is done on a PC.
[00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:37.680]   It still feels like the iPad, but it should be a lot easier to juggle apps.
[00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:39.840]   It looks like it should be easier to work with files.
[00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:44.040]   I feel like a fairly high percentage of the stuff this new files app will do.
[00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:47.440]   I'm already doing with third party apps, but it's probably going to be better if it's integrated
[00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:49.120]   into the operating system.
[00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:52.280]   Yeah, Micah, what do you think about this?
[00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:59.640]   I also was so nervous because I knew our friend Federico Vitticci, who is absolutely an iPad
[00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:04.040]   mastermind, was in the audience waiting and I was like, "Oh no, Federico's going to be
[00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:05.840]   so sad."
[00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:09.720]   But we didn't end up getting sad because they announced so many cool things.
[00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:14.680]   And I've been dragging and dropping and dragging again across the whole thing.
[00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:16.600]   And it's been really fun.
[00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:21.880]   One of the things that I've seen early on is the people who have access to the software,
[00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:28.120]   the beta, have kind of been complaining that the discoverability is a little not there.
[00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:33.320]   And there are some things that they're not able to understand right off the top.
[00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:39.120]   So I think it's going to take some learning, but I am absolutely down for a learning curve,
[00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:42.680]   if it means that I get all of these cool new features on the iPad.
[00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:47.800]   And then also a few little drag and drop features on iPhone as well, though we'll see how many
[00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:50.040]   of those stick around in future betas.
[00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:55.200]   Right, occasionally Apple has this reputation of sticking some sweet iPad feature in for
[00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:57.120]   the iPhone and the beta and then taking it out.
[00:28:57.120 --> 00:28:59.920]   No, the iPhone is going, "Oh man, that was a good one."
[00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:02.120]   Yeah, I had the same reaction.
[00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:04.680]   I was a little nervous, but then I got really excited.
[00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:06.920]   I do wonder about the discoverability.
[00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:09.680]   And I should say the public beta will be out later this month.
[00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:11.560]   There's a developer beta out now.
[00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:18.800]   It did kill my iPad, my 9.7-inch iPad when I installed it on there, and I had to reinstall
[00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:19.800]   it.
[00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:22.320]   But this is not, if you're not a developer, don't install it yet.
[00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:26.000]   There will be a public beta later this month and then a final version in the fall.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.840]   But the discoverability thing, I think this is one of the arguments is how advanced can
[00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:36.640]   you make iOS without risking ruining it for people who don't want the advanced features?
[00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:41.320]   And at first glance, just using it for about half an hour, I felt pretty good that Apple
[00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:44.680]   was doing a pretty good job of like, if you don't know the secrets, you just won't ever
[00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:45.680]   see them.
[00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:49.920]   And you know the secrets and you flip up a little bit further and start dragging things
[00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:53.040]   out of the dock, then kind of the universe unfolds before you.
[00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:57.360]   But that's the trick is you don't want, I was imagining somebody who's a novice user
[00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:00.880]   getting like into split screen drag mode and being like, what is happening?
[00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:04.480]   And that's part of Apple's challenge with this.
[00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:06.640]   Yeah, my mom.
[00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:13.240]   No, and I hate to use the your mom metric for technology because it's deeply insulting
[00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:15.480]   in both an age way and a gender way.
[00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:22.000]   You just mean your mom in particular who has actually gotten really into issues of tech
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.040]   accessibility for senior citizens.
[00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:29.760]   And I think if she were to get into a split screen mode, it would blow her mind in not
[00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:31.760]   in a great way and she'd come running at the back stairs.
[00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:32.760]   What am I doing?
[00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:39.200]   So I already have to do tech support on her Mac book and her iPad.
[00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:41.120]   And so I don't want to do this.
[00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:43.120]   That is that is always the risk.
[00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:48.440]   What do you all think about the argument that by making a dock like the Mac dock and adding
[00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:53.240]   in drag and drop and adding in something that looks an awful lot like mission control that
[00:30:53.240 --> 00:31:00.000]   this is a magnifying the iPad and is sort of counter to the iOS aesthetic or philosophy
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   or something?
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   Because I have heard those arguments.
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   Can you hear me?
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   That's an eye roll.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.480]   I'm doing verbally right there, but I'm curious.
[00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:07.560]   I don't understand why that's a bad thing.
[00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:11.680]   Well, I mean, the danger is that it's it's it's complex or that Apple is sort of planting
[00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:13.800]   and going back to the way they did it on the Mac.
[00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:18.480]   Although it doesn't feel to me particularly Mac like except in the fact that it's capable.
[00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:23.000]   This is not really a problem I've seen on like the surface, for example, for Microsoft
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:28.080]   is you don't see them really tying themselves in knots over having a distinctive tablet experience
[00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:30.800]   as opposed to a desktop slash laptop experience.
[00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:35.880]   And it's not something that Windows users that I've run across seem to have a oh, it's
[00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:38.080]   got to be simple and pure because it's on a tablet.
[00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:42.800]   I mean, I think of myself as being a fairly hard core.
[00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:48.160]   The iPad should not be a traditional computer kind of person.
[00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:49.160]   That's sad.
[00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:52.220]   I think it looks like they've done a really smart job of bringing in features that make
[00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:56.080]   sense and tweaking them where appropriate.
[00:31:56.080 --> 00:32:01.040]   It's, you know, before the event, people were talking about whether there might be a keyboard
[00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:02.040]   with a trackpad.
[00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:04.040]   I personally hate that idea.
[00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:08.440]   It used to be one of the few people who was perfectly happy lifting up my arm and touching
[00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:09.440]   stuff.
[00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:14.840]   And that's an example of a place where I think it makes sense to be fairly absolutist about
[00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:17.120]   not trying to turn the iPad into a Mac.
[00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:22.920]   But there need to be better ways to move information between iPad apps.
[00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:25.200]   So Dragon Drop makes a perfect sense.
[00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:29.560]   There are cases where it's really cumbersome not to be able to sort of get it files in a
[00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:33.360]   way that's a little bit closer to what you do on a Windows PC or Mac.
[00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:34.360]   So that makes sense.
[00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:39.040]   Yeah, the heaviest iPad users I know do not feel betrayed by these features.
[00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:40.960]   I like the term "macifying."
[00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:42.040]   That's a good term.
[00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:44.760]   But I, yeah, I have to agree.
[00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:46.720]   I don't think that there's with Lisa.
[00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:52.120]   I don't think that there's any reason to, you know, get all bent out of shape because
[00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:56.120]   it happens to look a little bit like what you can do on macOS.
[00:32:56.120 --> 00:32:57.120]   So what?
[00:32:57.120 --> 00:33:01.760]   If you're getting the things that you want out of the system, I don't care if it launched
[00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:03.720]   in, it said macOS as it started up.
[00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:05.000]   Like, fine, that's great.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:10.800]   As long as it gives me the functionality that I'm hoping to get out of an iPad version
[00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:12.000]   of iOS.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.640]   And, you know, if the dock is the thing that makes sense and so far playing with it, it
[00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:18.280]   does seem to make sense.
[00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:24.360]   And if a mission control type in between screen makes sense, then that's great too.
[00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:29.400]   You know, a file system of some sort, in this case with the Files app, that also gives me
[00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:34.200]   access to Dropbox and other services that choose to give permission there.
[00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:42.000]   I think that this is all very good and, you know, worrying about terminology or magnifying
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   or what have you just kind of gets in the way of the innovation that's happening here
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:51.600]   and the betterment of the system.
[00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:58.080]   And overall, you know, slowly but surely we're seeing a device that can creep into educational
[00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:05.040]   space and creep into other areas where people would, you know, my mom is not my kind of
[00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:07.720]   the person that I think I just think about my partner.
[00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:13.040]   And this new iPad is something that he absolutely could use as a replacement for a laptop because
[00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:15.880]   it has all those features and functionality.
[00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:20.080]   And yeah, it might be confusing at first, but I don't care.
[00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:21.520]   Again, I guess I have to go back to that.
[00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:25.520]   Oh, well, that looks a little bit like the Mac because I don't think that, you know, everyday
[00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:30.040]   people, my partner, your mom are worried about the fact that it's anything like the Mac.
[00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:31.880]   They're just going, what can this do for me?
[00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:34.560]   And if it's something that I need, then I'm happy with it.
[00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:36.880]   And they also don't care if it loads with a Mac OS boot screen.
[00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:41.600]   I think you could all I don't know this for sure, but I believe that there may be more
[00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:44.640]   iPad users than Mac users at this point.
[00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:50.240]   And that sometimes I wonder about like Apple strategy here is to basically leave the Mac
[00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:53.760]   kind of where it is, make little things here and there, but they're not trying to transform
[00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:58.640]   the Mac into a touchscreen interface like Microsoft is doing with Windows quite rightly.
[00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:02.240]   And Apple's answer is look, that's what the iPad is for.
[00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:03.440]   That's where they're going with it.
[00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:04.760]   And I think that's okay.
[00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:08.600]   I was less okay with that when they didn't add any features to the iPad for a couple
[00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:12.240]   of years, but I'm much more okay with it today than I would have been last week.
[00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:17.040]   I think most computing users approach the tools that they use and their software and their
[00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:22.320]   cloud services with, I just want to get to my stuff and do stuff to my stuff when I can.
[00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:24.320]   I don't care who makes the program.
[00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:28.000]   I don't care if the I don't care who makes the OS.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:29.480]   I just want my stuff.
[00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:30.480]   I want my stuff.
[00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:31.480]   I want to touch my stuff.
[00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:32.480]   I want to manipulate my stuff.
[00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:34.520]   I want to share my stuff out it goes.
[00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:37.280]   And that's that's it.
[00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:39.040]   We're people who follow technology.
[00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:40.800]   We follow companies.
[00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:41.800]   We follow developments.
[00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:45.720]   We may feel very passionately about certain types of tech developments, but we're not
[00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:47.320]   we're not the typical user.
[00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:48.640]   We're the we're the early edge.
[00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:52.400]   And I think we've got to remember that most of this technology is not built for us.
[00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:54.480]   Yeah, we can talk about it, but it's not built for us.
[00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:55.480]   I so well put.
[00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:59.040]   Yeah, there should be a disclaimer on everything that is written or spoken about technology
[00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:03.240]   by technology experts that says this is probably actually not for us, but we're the
[00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:05.520]   ones who get it first and tear it apart.
[00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:07.160]   And that can lead to some weird distortions.
[00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:12.880]   I can use my mom as an example because, you know, now that she's retired and has discovered
[00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:18.400]   Netflix and Amazon Kindle and Dropbox and Google mail and all of these things, watching
[00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:23.680]   my mom jump into cloud services and use them to coordinate the stuff that she does at
[00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:28.200]   her senior center and sharing scrapbooks with people and things like that.
[00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:31.240]   Just her expectation that computing is is her stuff.
[00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:34.720]   And I want to take my stuff and do this and do this and I want to be able to do it in
[00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:35.720]   two steps.
[00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:39.840]   And when you have to explain, well, you've hosted your photos here, they have to be downloaded,
[00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:42.720]   then they have to be re uploaded, then they have to go here and she's all that makes no
[00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:43.720]   sense.
[00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:45.560]   And I thought, well, this is.
[00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:46.560]   Yeah.
[00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:50.360]   So the vendors and services and computing people who recognize that most people want
[00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:54.240]   a frictionless experience, they want a computing experience that is literally the equivalent
[00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:56.480]   of picking up a stack of paper and filing it.
[00:36:56.480 --> 00:37:01.680]   Like that's all they want and give them a frictionless experience and you will earn their
[00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:02.680]   loyalty.
[00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:05.240]   They're not going to go with you just because, oh, it's a locked in ecosystem and all the
[00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:06.320]   parts fit together.
[00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:08.240]   You know, nobody has loyalty to an ecosystem.
[00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:09.880]   They have loyalty to their stuff.
[00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:14.760]   Harry, you and I both have these 12.9 inch iPad pros sitting on this table.
[00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:20.640]   The 10.5 inch iPad Pro that was announced this week, it feels when you hold it like the
[00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:27.920]   old standard iPad and the 9.7 iPad Pro, but it does have a bigger screen.
[00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:32.960]   It does take a bigger keyboard that the keys are a little bit more normal sized.
[00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:39.240]   What are you tempted as a 12.9 inch iPad user to go back down or is this more just to give
[00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:42.120]   more room to the people who want the smaller iPad Pro?
[00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:43.680]   I've been wrestling with that.
[00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:45.920]   I mean, this is my primary computing device.
[00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:49.360]   I use this sometimes more than eight hours a day.
[00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:54.120]   I think and I often use it just kind of sitting down near a desk.
[00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:57.360]   Lisa has pulled out her 9.7 inch iPad Pro now.
[00:37:57.360 --> 00:37:59.720]   They're all good.
[00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:00.720]   They're all fine.
[00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:01.720]   It's adorable.
[00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:02.720]   I love it.
[00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:05.280]   I think for really serious people, a big screen makes a lot of sense.
[00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:10.880]   I think there probably are even more people who don't need a screen this large and would
[00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:13.080]   be happy paying a little bit less.
[00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:19.280]   I think from what I've seen so far, it looks like the 20% extra space compared to the
[00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:22.120]   9.7 one on the 10.5 will help.
[00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:23.800]   It's probably not transformative.
[00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:25.600]   It doesn't feel any bigger though.
[00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:27.240]   I'm not on the 12.9 is it does.
[00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:29.120]   I mean, it's huge.
[00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:30.120]   Let's just say it.
[00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:31.680]   It is a gigantic tablet.
[00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:32.680]   It's heavy.
[00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:33.680]   It's huge.
[00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:34.680]   I love it too.
[00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:39.000]   But with a 10.5, it doesn't feel any bigger because they reduce the bezels.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:40.880]   It feels basically just as thin and light.
[00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:41.880]   It weighs the same.
[00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:42.880]   And it weighs the same.
[00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:45.480]   There's a big difference between a pound and a pound and a half.
[00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:46.480]   Yeah.
[00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:47.480]   And you get more pixels.
[00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:48.480]   So it is a bigger screen in there.
[00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:50.120]   So yeah, I'm kind of with you.
[00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:51.120]   I want to try it.
[00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:52.520]   I want to live with it for a little while and see.
[00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:56.120]   But my gut feeling is that I'm not going to leave the 12.9 because I'm one of those
[00:38:56.120 --> 00:38:58.800]   nutty people who really likes that huge screen.
[00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:04.200]   But I think most people will get the 10.5 and will be very happy that it's got more pixels
[00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:05.480]   than the 9.7 did.
[00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:10.760]   I think stuff like the split screen view on 9.7 inches feels a little bit cramped and even
[00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:15.120]   just a little extra space will help make that make more sense for more people.
[00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:16.360]   Yeah, you will still.
[00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:20.640]   It's not quite big enough that those aren't two sort of phone app views in split screen,
[00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:23.920]   whereas on the 12.9 you get like full iPad layouts.
[00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:27.120]   But it's still a superior experience.
[00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:32.560]   And the power in those things is amazing as we also saw with some of the demos that Apple
[00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:35.680]   did on stage, which maybe we'll talk about in a little bit.
[00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:42.000]   But first I suspect, again, hovering, watching us, Leo sees all knows all and has another
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.680]   message for us from beyond this room.
[00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:46.120]   Not again, he's fine.
[00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:47.120]   Just beyond this room.
[00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:48.120]   So let's hear from Leo.
[00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:50.600]   All right, guys, I'll be right back to you in a second.
[00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:52.400]   But first a word from Rocket Mortgage.
[00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:55.600]   Rocket Mortgage comes to you from Quicken Loans.
[00:39:55.600 --> 00:40:00.960]   Quicken Loans is the is the best lender in the United States, really a forward thinking
[00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:01.960]   company.
[00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:07.240]   And notice the mortgage experience applying for a loan wasn't keeping up with the times.
[00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:11.680]   Frankly, it's kind of like a trip back to the 19th century.
[00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:14.200]   I remember when Lisa and I bought our house house for a living.
[00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:18.160]   And the last time we applied for loans about three years ago took months.
[00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:23.240]   And the big bank that we went to, I won't name names, but you I think you probably know
[00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:24.480]   who they are.
[00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:26.960]   They kept they kept coming back to us.
[00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:28.640]   Oh, now we need this.
[00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:29.800]   We went on vacation.
[00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:31.400]   We thought, Oh, it can't possibly take a month.
[00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:32.400]   It took more than a month.
[00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:38.760]   We're on vacation, faxing them information from Greece because it was crazy.
[00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:44.040]   Man, next time Rocket Mortgage all the way, they give you the confidence you need when
[00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:47.800]   it comes to buying a home or refinancing an existing home loan.
[00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:49.240]   It's easy.
[00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:51.560]   You will you will understand all the details.
[00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:56.760]   It's convenient because they have relationships with all the banks, all the trusted partners.
[00:40:56.760 --> 00:41:00.400]   So it's really easy to share your financial information with Rocket Mortgage.
[00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:02.920]   You don't have to go digging through paperwork.
[00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:05.280]   You just touch the screen.
[00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:10.560]   And by the way, you can do this all on your phone, on your tablet, on your computer, whether
[00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:13.300]   you're buying your first home or your 10th.
[00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:17.640]   Rocket Mortgage can do it fast because it's computers.
[00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:22.320]   They'll get you that loan in minutes and they'll be the right loan for you.
[00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:29.160]   Rocket Mortgage from quick and loans apply simply understand fully mortgage with confidence

[00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:36.080]   That's rocketmortgage.com/twit2.
[00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:38.760]   Of course, Rocket Mortgage is an equal housing lender.
[00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:45.160]   They're licensed in all 50 states and MLS consumer access.org number 30, 30.
[00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:48.160]   Rocket Mortgage from quick and loans.
[00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:49.160]   It's awesome.
[00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:55.000]   Go to rocketmortgage.com/twit2 and we thank Rocket Mortgage by quick and loans for their
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:58.400]   support of our show.
[00:41:58.400 --> 00:41:59.400]   Thank you, Leo.
[00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:00.560]   We're back.
[00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:03.600]   I'm going to take a break from Apple.
[00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:04.600]   We're going to come back.
[00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:08.360]   There's more Apple, but I know I need to give everybody a respite from Apple.
[00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:13.200]   So we're going to move to another company that starts with A and talk about Amazon a
[00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:14.200]   little bit.
[00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:21.880]   This week, Amazon announced a low cost version of Amazon Prime for people in the US who are
[00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:25.200]   on government assistance with an EBT card.
[00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:29.880]   This is a way for Amazon to reach an audience so that they aren't really reaching right
[00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:30.880]   now.
[00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:35.920]   In fact, there's an amazing statistic that I saw about Amazon's penetration into the
[00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:43.480]   US market by income where it said that people who are earning more than basically 112,000
[00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:51.320]   to 82% of them already have Amazon Prime, whereas only 52% of people in the 21 to 41,000
[00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:53.440]   annual income have Amazon.
[00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:59.200]   So Amazon sort of got a different place to grow now and this may be a reason why.
[00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:02.520]   Lisa, I know you follow retail stuff very closely.
[00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:07.320]   Yeah, what's your take on Amazon taking Amazon Prime to this audience of people with lower
[00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:08.320]   incomes?
[00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:14.920]   This is actually one of two programs they're doing to try to expand their retail reach
[00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:19.640]   beyond the six figure household because this summer they're also teaming up for a two-year
[00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:27.200]   pilot program with the Department of Agriculture where people who are using federal food aid
[00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:32.360]   can order groceries through Amazon Prime and Amazon Direct.
[00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:36.800]   The Department of Agriculture is doing this program with Fresh Direct and Safeway and
[00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:38.880]   a couple other companies as well.
[00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:46.160]   So, this is one thing, but Amazon has been trying to take on Walmart, as it were, or
[00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:47.560]   Walmart is trying to take on Amazon.
[00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:50.680]   It's not clear who the aggressor is in this situation.
[00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:55.200]   It's kind of like looking at those pictures of snakes versus crocodiles, like alligators
[00:43:55.200 --> 00:44:00.080]   in Florida, like you're not sure who to root one.
[00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:06.480]   But to put it this way, the companies are kind of coming from opposites towards the same
[00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:10.520]   problem, which is how they both want to grow e-commerce.
[00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:17.360]   Amazon has more room for growth in income tiers that are, say, sub-85,000.
[00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:23.080]   Walmart has room for growth in income tiers because Walmart's got the lower middle class
[00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:25.400]   and middle class income tiers pretty firmly locked in.
[00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:28.760]   It's had almost no success gaining traction above.
[00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:32.760]   So, this is the reason why when Amazon announced Prime Day, Walmart was like, "Oh, we'll do
[00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:36.880]   you better," and had a competing event.
[00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:40.240]   They both recently modified their free shipping and their free return.
[00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:45.680]   And this is just another salvo where Amazon is trying to attract loyalty from customers
[00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:49.120]   who are otherwise pretty firmly entrenched in a Walmart base.
[00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:52.080]   And Amazon figures that Walmart's strength is their geography.
[00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:54.080]   They have stores everywhere.
[00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:56.680]   Amazon's strength is that they can reach everywhere with shipping.
[00:44:56.680 --> 00:45:01.560]   So they are kind of natural rivals of the fact that Walmart's got to get the stuff there
[00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:04.440]   in trucks and pay people in their stores.
[00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:08.800]   And Amazon has to get stuff in UPS trucks and pay people in their warehouses, right?
[00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:10.800]   But they're both strangely comfortable.
[00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:14.880]   Interestingly, both Walmart and Amazon are now experimenting without sourcing their
[00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:19.960]   deliveries where Walmart is now launching a program where its employees will make deliveries
[00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:21.920]   on the way home from their job.
[00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:28.400]   And Amazon is now outsourcing, so it's delivering two-third parties who are willing to just
[00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:29.720]   kind of drive around.
[00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:33.400]   It's like TaskRibut or Uber, except what you do is you drop off packages all day.
[00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:34.920]   I had somebody deliver my Prime Package.
[00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:35.920]   This is what Kud did that.
[00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:37.840]   And she was really startled when I quizzed her for 10 minutes.
[00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:39.840]   Like, "How did you get started?"
[00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:41.240]   And do you do a lot of driving?
[00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:43.800]   And what do you get compensated for?
[00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:45.840]   I got to meet somebody in person who was doing this.
[00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:46.680]   Why wouldn't she not?
[00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:47.200]   No.
[00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:47.520]   Right?
[00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:50.200]   In terms of who the aggressor is, these
[00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:52.200]   are two of the most aggressive companies
[00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:53.580]   in the history of the world.
[00:45:53.580 --> 00:45:55.180]   I think they're both really aggressive.
[00:45:55.180 --> 00:45:56.320]   Walmart.
[00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:57.840]   Python versus Alligator.
[00:45:57.840 --> 00:46:00.640]   Walmart has this long history of not really doing all that well
[00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:03.000]   competing with Amazon in terms of online,
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:06.120]   but they spent a huge amount of money for Jet.com
[00:46:06.120 --> 00:46:10.340]   and put the Jet.com guy in charge of all their online operations.
[00:46:10.340 --> 00:46:13.480]   I think that's a story that's still unfolding
[00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:15.880]   given that Jet.com was so new.
[00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:21.600]   It's not like Jet.com had managed to kill Amazon on its own.
[00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:23.520]   But it's fun to watch because I think they will both do
[00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:26.520]   everything in their power to hurt the other guy in a way
[00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:28.520]   that will probably end up being good for consumers.
[00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:31.400]   In the short term, yeah.
[00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:34.480]   Part of the play, one of the reasons this is smart for Amazon
[00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:37.880]   is if they've already got saturation at the high end,
[00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:41.120]   you can actually make a lot of money off of lower income
[00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:44.560]   retail tiers if you provide a service at a reasonable price
[00:46:44.560 --> 00:46:46.640]   point that they keep coming back to over and over again.
[00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:48.280]   I mean, this has been true in banking for years,
[00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:51.960]   where check cashing corporations make tremendous amounts
[00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:54.240]   of money from the unbanked.
[00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:55.640]   The profit margins are insane there.
[00:46:55.640 --> 00:46:58.000]   And so with Walmart, they've got that Walmart with Amazon,
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:00.800]   they've got the same potential, where they can grow that audience.
[00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:02.880]   Walmart is in a slightly more vulnerable position
[00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:05.480]   because their core audience has traditionally
[00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:08.120]   had less discretionary spending power.
[00:47:08.120 --> 00:47:11.560]   And so their sales are more closely tied to recessions,
[00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:13.000]   economic ups and downs.
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:15.280]   And their inability to penetrate tiers
[00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:19.120]   with higher percentages of discretionary income
[00:47:19.120 --> 00:47:21.560]   might actually hurt them in a way that it won't hurt Amazon.
[00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:26.760]   Since Amazon's got that cushy shopper protection going.
[00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:29.960]   I wonder about the impact this would have on--
[00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:32.200]   I started to wonder the impact this would have on the world
[00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:32.720]   around us.
[00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:34.880]   And then I realized that every retail business that
[00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:37.440]   wasn't killed by Walmart was probably killed by Amazon.
[00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:40.880]   So they're just fighting over the sun blasted desert remains.
[00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:44.720]   What I would actually keep an eye on are groceries.
[00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:47.320]   The grocery industry historically runs on a very slim margin
[00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:48.560]   to begin with.
[00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:52.160]   And the higher the number of subscription-based things
[00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:53.920]   that come out, the more pressure gets
[00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:55.600]   put on your local grocery stores.
[00:47:55.600 --> 00:47:58.000]   And then the question becomes, when
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:01.800]   does it become non-viable for the local place that is only 5, 10,
[00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:03.040]   20 miles away?
[00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:06.080]   When do they go out of business?
[00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:09.120]   I think with Amazon, too, you know,
[00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:10.320]   Lise, you kind of touched on this.
[00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:13.040]   The fact that customers kind of keep coming back
[00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:14.880]   and getting the same thing.
[00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:16.480]   And Amazon is really good at that.
[00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:18.240]   I mean, I have a bunch of Amazon dash
[00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:22.680]   buttons in my home for purchasing in bulk different products
[00:48:22.680 --> 00:48:27.720]   like paper towels, napkins, and certain non-perishable food
[00:48:27.720 --> 00:48:28.440]   items.
[00:48:28.440 --> 00:48:30.600]   And I love the fact that I hit that button
[00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:33.720]   and I can count on in two days most of the time,
[00:48:33.720 --> 00:48:36.360]   unless it's like the weekend, in which case it's three days,
[00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:38.720]   that will be at my doorstep waiting for me.
[00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:43.000]   And I can replace the product that's been used.
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:48.360]   And if Amazon can do this with people who--
[00:48:48.360 --> 00:48:51.120]   their kids like the same cereal every month,
[00:48:51.120 --> 00:48:56.640]   then you just need your bread and you need your macaroni
[00:48:56.640 --> 00:48:58.160]   and cheese or what have you.
[00:48:58.160 --> 00:49:00.080]   And Amazon will always have it.
[00:49:00.080 --> 00:49:00.760]   It'll always be there.
[00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:03.680]   It'll always be at a cost that you can kind of count on.
[00:49:03.680 --> 00:49:05.600]   That's a huge deal.
[00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:10.400]   Growing up, when my family and I moved from California
[00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:13.680]   to the Midwest, there was a period of time
[00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:16.520]   where my mom was on government assistance
[00:49:16.520 --> 00:49:17.800]   and used EBT cards.
[00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:21.360]   And I can remember we would basically
[00:49:21.360 --> 00:49:24.520]   have the same items every time.
[00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:26.560]   Every time it was time for mom to go out and get groceries
[00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:29.200]   for all of us kids, it was the same stuff.
[00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:31.760]   And that's because you could mostly count on a price
[00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:34.080]   and you could count on all of us not being picky about it
[00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:35.560]   because it was stuff that we liked.
[00:49:35.560 --> 00:49:38.680]   And Amazon, like I said, is already very good
[00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:41.760]   about keeping those items in stock
[00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:44.920]   and making sure that, hey, if I hit this button,
[00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:46.080]   it's going to be there.
[00:49:46.080 --> 00:49:50.520]   So looking specifically at the kind of human side of things
[00:49:50.520 --> 00:49:52.080]   as opposed to the company side of things,
[00:49:52.080 --> 00:49:53.600]   I'm really excited about this.
[00:49:53.600 --> 00:49:55.440]   It was certainly helpful for my mom
[00:49:55.440 --> 00:49:58.200]   and all of us kids having their government assistance.
[00:49:58.200 --> 00:50:01.240]   And so for Amazon to accept that and open up
[00:50:01.240 --> 00:50:04.760]   Amazon Prime so that a mom can say,
[00:50:04.760 --> 00:50:07.200]   I can trust that in two days there's going to be
[00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:09.400]   the stuff that I need to make my kids lunches
[00:50:09.400 --> 00:50:11.840]   that they take to school, that's awesome.
[00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:14.000]   So this is really cool.
[00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:16.640]   Even if it was alligator Amazon
[00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:20.840]   and the scary snake that is Walmart or fighting,
[00:50:20.840 --> 00:50:21.840]   we'll let them do that.
[00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:23.560]   I think this is great for consumers.
[00:50:23.560 --> 00:50:25.120]   - Well, you mentioned that it's diapers
[00:50:25.120 --> 00:50:27.960]   'cause what got me into Amazon Prime in a honesty
[00:50:27.960 --> 00:50:32.160]   was when I had my daughter and was weighing,
[00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:33.640]   do I want to take a screaming newborn
[00:50:33.640 --> 00:50:35.240]   to the store while I buy diapers?
[00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:37.320]   Or do I sign up for Amazon parent
[00:50:37.320 --> 00:50:40.200]   where they ship me the diapers reliably?
[00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:41.040]   - Tough question.
[00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:42.280]   - In less than 24 hours.
[00:50:42.280 --> 00:50:44.360]   And that was how I got sucked in
[00:50:44.360 --> 00:50:46.760]   because prior to 2010 I did not do a whole lot
[00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:50.320]   of buying on Amazon and they gave me a year of free Prime
[00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:53.800]   and it was just easy enough to go tick, tick, tick, tick,
[00:50:53.800 --> 00:50:56.560]   and for people who are on assistance
[00:50:56.560 --> 00:50:58.520]   and do need to buy diapers,
[00:50:58.520 --> 00:51:00.120]   Amazon's prices are crazy low.
[00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:01.400]   And so if you can get cheap diapers
[00:51:01.400 --> 00:51:02.400]   and they're shipped to YouTube,
[00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:06.520]   that's a great way to build up vendor and brand loyalty
[00:51:06.520 --> 00:51:09.560]   among an audience that hasn't had access
[00:51:09.560 --> 00:51:12.720]   to the free shipping and the Amazon Prime perks
[00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:14.560]   as much as they would have before.
[00:51:14.560 --> 00:51:19.760]   This is also, I wouldn't say I feel sorry for Walmart,
[00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:24.760]   but what is formidable is that with Amazon Pro,
[00:51:24.760 --> 00:51:27.480]   formidable is that with Amazon doing something like this,
[00:51:27.480 --> 00:51:31.520]   they will also be creating a tremendous trove of data
[00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:36.400]   that they can then collate, aggregate, analyze, and sell.
[00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:39.960]   And for something like this, Amazon's retail arm
[00:51:39.960 --> 00:51:42.840]   is almost what they use as a data generation device
[00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:44.240]   for the real businesses they run,
[00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:47.320]   which are cloud hosting and data management and data sales.
[00:51:47.320 --> 00:51:50.480]   And the question I have is whether or not Walmart
[00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:52.360]   is going to be able to catch up by capturing
[00:51:52.360 --> 00:51:54.840]   the same type of user purchasing patterns
[00:51:54.840 --> 00:51:57.080]   and collating that data and selling that as well.
[00:51:57.080 --> 00:51:58.720]   'Cause that's the kind of stuff
[00:51:58.720 --> 00:52:00.280]   that you can sell back to retailers
[00:52:00.280 --> 00:52:03.320]   and work with them on price points.
[00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:05.440]   - And realizing that what we said earlier
[00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:08.240]   that in certain demographic groups,
[00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:10.040]   with the highest incomes in the United States,
[00:52:10.040 --> 00:52:12.280]   82% of households have Amazon Prime.
[00:52:12.280 --> 00:52:15.160]   That means Amazon has data of 82%.
[00:52:15.160 --> 00:52:17.840]   And the lowest at there was still over 50%.
[00:52:17.840 --> 00:52:20.720]   So Amazon's data about what's available
[00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:23.160]   and what people are buying is staggering right now.
[00:52:23.160 --> 00:52:26.360]   - Yeah, and that's one area where I really feel like Walmart,
[00:52:26.360 --> 00:52:28.000]   unless there's a secret push that they just have
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:29.240]   kept very close to the chest because
[00:52:29.240 --> 00:52:31.320]   why would you let everybody know you're doing this?
[00:52:31.320 --> 00:52:34.480]   That's one area where Walmart would probably need
[00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:37.560]   to catch up in a hurry is how to collect data
[00:52:37.560 --> 00:52:39.600]   on their shoppers that they can then turn around
[00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:40.840]   and turn into another revenue stream,
[00:52:40.840 --> 00:52:42.200]   whereas Amazon is only doing that.
[00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:43.240]   - Don't tell them that.
[00:52:43.240 --> 00:52:44.240]   (laughing)
[00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:46.680]   Nobody helped the snake or is it the alligator?
[00:52:46.680 --> 00:52:47.680]   I can't. - Right, which is a matter.
[00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:50.600]   - So we made Walmart the ball python here.
[00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:53.560]   - Yeah, 'cause you got to have alligator Amazon obviously.
[00:52:53.560 --> 00:52:54.400]   - Yeah, ah-ha.
[00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:55.240]   - Oh, there you go.
[00:52:55.240 --> 00:52:56.640]   Very nice.
[00:52:56.640 --> 00:52:59.120]   Well, we should, I'm gonna steer us,
[00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:00.880]   that's right, that was your respite from Apple
[00:53:00.880 --> 00:53:02.760]   because we're gonna talk about a little more Apple now.
[00:53:02.760 --> 00:53:04.960]   There's so much, we just have to do it.
[00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:06.520]   I have other things to talk about,
[00:53:06.520 --> 00:53:08.400]   but I wanna talk about a couple more things
[00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:10.680]   that came out of Apple's developer conference.
[00:53:10.680 --> 00:53:12.000]   But I wanna start with iOS 11.
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:14.120]   So iOS, we talked about the iPad features
[00:53:14.120 --> 00:53:16.000]   and we talked about how before they announced those,
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:18.120]   they announced a bunch of other features that made us sad
[00:53:18.120 --> 00:53:20.440]   because we thought there were no iPad features
[00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:22.240]   and in fact, these are the features
[00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:23.760]   that are gonna be used by the most people
[00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:25.120]   because they're gonna be on the iPhone
[00:53:25.120 --> 00:53:27.520]   which is Apple's most successful product
[00:53:27.520 --> 00:53:29.600]   and most popular product.
[00:53:29.600 --> 00:53:32.640]   Strangely, one of the features that got the most excitement
[00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:34.320]   in the crowd and that I'm most excited about
[00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:37.160]   is a feature that turns off all the other features
[00:53:37.160 --> 00:53:39.880]   which is called do not disturb when driving
[00:53:39.880 --> 00:53:42.360]   which will sense when you're driving
[00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:46.600]   and lock out your phone so that you can't get
[00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:48.600]   distracted by push notifications
[00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:50.440]   or will limit your push notifications
[00:53:50.440 --> 00:53:54.240]   to very specific sets including actually querying people
[00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:57.240]   who text you and say, is this important enough
[00:53:57.240 --> 00:53:59.720]   to override do not disturb while driving?
[00:53:59.720 --> 00:54:02.160]   And boy, if you say yes to that
[00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:03.680]   and it's not important, you're gonna get in trouble
[00:54:03.680 --> 00:54:05.600]   is what I'm gonna say, somebody's gonna be mad.
[00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:08.440]   So I'm curious what you all thought about this announcement
[00:54:08.440 --> 00:54:10.240]   and what Apple's doing here
[00:54:10.240 --> 00:54:13.260]   with locking iPhone features out when you're in the car.
[00:54:13.260 --> 00:54:15.280]   Micah?
[00:54:15.280 --> 00:54:16.120]   - I think it's smart.
[00:54:16.120 --> 00:54:17.760]   Yeah, I think it's a really smart thing
[00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:21.600]   and there were some companies who were kind of working
[00:54:21.600 --> 00:54:24.480]   on bringing these features to phones
[00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:26.960]   but it was always like cellular carriers
[00:54:26.960 --> 00:54:28.600]   and insurance companies.
[00:54:28.600 --> 00:54:31.080]   And there's just something to say about
[00:54:31.080 --> 00:54:34.040]   how entirely uncool it is to be like,
[00:54:34.040 --> 00:54:35.960]   yeah, I downloaded the AT&T app
[00:54:35.960 --> 00:54:37.640]   so it could lock all my devices
[00:54:37.640 --> 00:54:40.040]   and no one can text me while I'm driving
[00:54:40.040 --> 00:54:42.560]   but the fact that Apple has this built in
[00:54:42.560 --> 00:54:44.720]   and that you can enable this feature
[00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:48.120]   and it just says, hey, whenever we can sense
[00:54:48.120 --> 00:54:49.720]   that you're driving in a vehicle,
[00:54:49.720 --> 00:54:52.880]   then we're going to make things,
[00:54:52.880 --> 00:54:53.720]   so you won't see things.
[00:54:53.720 --> 00:54:55.960]   'Cause I think part of the problem,
[00:54:55.960 --> 00:54:59.760]   I think people would be more apt to stay away
[00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:01.720]   from texting and driving or Snapchatting
[00:55:01.720 --> 00:55:04.960]   and driving or what have you if they don't write,
[00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:07.000]   if they don't see those things in the first place
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:09.640]   'cause ultimately a lot of us,
[00:55:09.640 --> 00:55:12.240]   we just end up in the end having,
[00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:14.920]   what is it, prehistoric brains?
[00:55:14.920 --> 00:55:16.720]   And it's like we see something light up
[00:55:16.720 --> 00:55:19.360]   and our eyes instantly turn to it and look at it
[00:55:19.360 --> 00:55:21.560]   and it's just kind of the way we're wired
[00:55:21.560 --> 00:55:23.800]   or at least have wired ourselves over time.
[00:55:23.800 --> 00:55:26.120]   And if those notifications just aren't there
[00:55:26.120 --> 00:55:27.840]   in the first place then it's less likely
[00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:29.560]   that you're going to pay attention to them
[00:55:29.560 --> 00:55:31.360]   which it really sounds really obvious
[00:55:31.360 --> 00:55:32.560]   but at the same time,
[00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:33.560]   I do think there's something
[00:55:33.560 --> 00:55:36.320]   to kind of keeping that out of your line of vision
[00:55:36.320 --> 00:55:37.760]   and then your brain does a better job
[00:55:37.760 --> 00:55:40.280]   of resisting needing to get that little dopamine hit
[00:55:40.280 --> 00:55:44.160]   from seeing the latest Instagram like on yourselfy.
[00:55:44.160 --> 00:55:47.120]   So this just seems like a good idea overall
[00:55:47.120 --> 00:55:49.600]   and I hope that people do take advantage of it
[00:55:49.600 --> 00:55:52.040]   and the fact that you can kind of set it up to say,
[00:55:52.040 --> 00:55:54.200]   "Hey, this person's driving right now
[00:55:54.200 --> 00:55:57.600]   "but you can contact them later," is really nice.
[00:55:57.600 --> 00:55:59.520]   - One thing I wasn't clear about from the demo
[00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:02.600]   is whether this also shuts them off on an Apple watch
[00:56:02.600 --> 00:56:07.200]   because I'm pretty good at not looking at my phone
[00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:10.000]   but I do sort of sometimes glance at my wrist
[00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:12.760]   without totally taking my eye off the road
[00:56:12.760 --> 00:56:14.200]   which I thought of as sort of being
[00:56:14.200 --> 00:56:16.680]   a maybe semi-safe halfway point.
[00:56:16.680 --> 00:56:18.200]   (laughs)
[00:56:18.200 --> 00:56:20.560]   - Yeah, I have that same little bargaining behavior
[00:56:20.560 --> 00:56:23.880]   which is well, you know, it's not looking at a phone,
[00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:25.240]   it's just going and singing my watch.
[00:56:25.240 --> 00:56:27.240]   People wear watches that don't have texts on them
[00:56:27.240 --> 00:56:28.840]   and they check their watches when they're driving
[00:56:28.840 --> 00:56:31.680]   and nobody dies probably except one of the things
[00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:35.600]   that struck me about this is this is a feature
[00:56:35.600 --> 00:56:37.800]   that will, I mean, almost certainly save lives, right?
[00:56:37.800 --> 00:56:39.440]   Just by interceding and saying,
[00:56:39.440 --> 00:56:41.800]   most of these notifications are junk
[00:56:41.800 --> 00:56:44.600]   which I like some of these features all the time,
[00:56:44.600 --> 00:56:47.640]   honestly on my iPhone and just getting them out of the way
[00:56:47.640 --> 00:56:49.960]   and being contextual and maybe letting through
[00:56:49.960 --> 00:56:52.560]   if somebody on your contacts list calls or texts
[00:56:52.560 --> 00:56:53.640]   because it's super important
[00:56:53.640 --> 00:56:55.920]   but otherwise just like quieting down
[00:56:55.920 --> 00:56:57.240]   while you're driving seems like such a good idea.
[00:56:57.240 --> 00:56:58.360]   - That's the important word is context
[00:56:58.360 --> 00:57:00.760]   because I really want, I want to live
[00:57:00.760 --> 00:57:04.320]   in a computing world where I have context-dependent notifications
[00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:09.040]   because if I'm driving and if while I'm driving,
[00:57:09.040 --> 00:57:10.600]   my husband texts me and says,
[00:57:10.600 --> 00:57:12.760]   while you're out and about, please pick up groceries,
[00:57:12.760 --> 00:57:14.560]   that is a notification I don't mind getting
[00:57:14.560 --> 00:57:16.520]   while I'm driving, especially if I can get it read to me
[00:57:16.520 --> 00:57:18.120]   instead of reading it myself.
[00:57:18.120 --> 00:57:19.960]   But if it's somebody else going,
[00:57:19.960 --> 00:57:22.120]   hey, can you pass on the name of so-and-so
[00:57:22.120 --> 00:57:23.400]   that you recommended for such and says,
[00:57:23.400 --> 00:57:25.320]   no, I don't need that one.
[00:57:25.320 --> 00:57:28.240]   But I would love to see more context-dependent
[00:57:28.240 --> 00:57:31.040]   notifications, I think this is a good start.
[00:57:31.040 --> 00:57:33.160]   I hope that context-dependent gets split out
[00:57:33.160 --> 00:57:36.800]   from the safety aspect so that we start working on that more.
[00:57:36.800 --> 00:57:39.520]   I think the safety aspect is super important.
[00:57:39.520 --> 00:57:42.320]   I think context-dependent will ultimately be better
[00:57:42.320 --> 00:57:43.480]   for computing in the long run.
[00:57:43.480 --> 00:57:46.800]   - Yeah, in the chat room they're talking about nanny features
[00:57:46.800 --> 00:57:49.120]   and this is the thing, this can be a nanny feature
[00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:51.560]   if you're weak-willed and you know you're gonna check
[00:57:51.560 --> 00:57:52.640]   your phone if you don't see it.
[00:57:52.640 --> 00:57:55.080]   I think the upside of this is not when it's a nanny feature
[00:57:55.080 --> 00:57:57.560]   but when it is that smart assistant saying,
[00:57:57.560 --> 00:57:59.600]   I'm only gonna buzz you when you're driving
[00:57:59.600 --> 00:58:01.320]   if there's really something important
[00:58:01.320 --> 00:58:02.440]   otherwise I'm gonna lay off.
[00:58:02.440 --> 00:58:03.880]   And that's how it should be.
[00:58:03.880 --> 00:58:07.680]   That's not preventing me a weak person
[00:58:07.680 --> 00:58:09.080]   from checking my phone while I'm driving.
[00:58:09.080 --> 00:58:11.360]   That's preventing me a regular driver
[00:58:11.360 --> 00:58:13.400]   from being distracted by pointless things.
[00:58:13.400 --> 00:58:14.880]   And there's a difference there.
[00:58:14.880 --> 00:58:17.880]   - You don't need LinkedIn notifications while you're driving.
[00:58:17.880 --> 00:58:18.760]   I thought we all did.
[00:58:18.760 --> 00:58:19.600]   - No.
[00:58:19.600 --> 00:58:22.360]   - Well, it depends on who I want to add to my social network
[00:58:22.360 --> 00:58:24.480]   but probably, sorry, my professional network.
[00:58:24.480 --> 00:58:25.320]   It's very important.
[00:58:25.320 --> 00:58:27.400]   - I found that in general life is better
[00:58:27.400 --> 00:58:30.080]   if you default to turning off notifications
[00:58:30.080 --> 00:58:33.000]   on a very high percentage of the apps you use
[00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:36.000]   and to some degree, I'm already down to a point
[00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:38.240]   where most of the notifications I get
[00:58:38.240 --> 00:58:39.840]   are at least semi-important to me
[00:58:39.840 --> 00:58:42.040]   and there's no absolute junk.
[00:58:42.040 --> 00:58:43.880]   - It does make me wonder if this is the beachhead
[00:58:43.880 --> 00:58:47.320]   for a more smart assistant-based feature
[00:58:47.320 --> 00:58:50.600]   where Apple basically says, would you like to go
[00:58:50.600 --> 00:58:55.000]   into some mode where Siri essentially looks
[00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:58.560]   at your notifications and only directly buzzes you
[00:58:58.560 --> 00:58:59.680]   when it's important, right?
[00:58:59.680 --> 00:59:01.440]   - Because that would be very valuable.
[00:59:01.440 --> 00:59:03.280]   - I think that is where we're headed honestly
[00:59:03.280 --> 00:59:05.800]   because some of the stuff that I've already seen
[00:59:05.800 --> 00:59:08.760]   and some of the stuff that we'll see
[00:59:08.760 --> 00:59:11.280]   with the public beta hits, but let's just say
[00:59:11.280 --> 00:59:13.040]   I happen to have come across with this stuff
[00:59:13.040 --> 00:59:17.040]   while I'm totally not using the NDA beta software.
[00:59:17.040 --> 00:59:20.800]   Anyway, Siri is paying more attention than Siri used to
[00:59:20.800 --> 00:59:24.520]   and even in conversations, 'cause we did see this on stage
[00:59:24.520 --> 00:59:25.360]   so I could talk about that.
[00:59:25.360 --> 00:59:28.800]   Of course, the keyboard and the predictive text,
[00:59:28.800 --> 00:59:31.040]   it was almost scary because I was talking to someone
[00:59:31.040 --> 00:59:33.240]   on Twitter about a particular subject
[00:59:33.240 --> 00:59:35.600]   and then when I went to an iMessage conversation
[00:59:35.600 --> 00:59:39.280]   with that same person and I used the word Twitter,
[00:59:39.280 --> 00:59:42.240]   then the predictive text popped up the subject
[00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:44.560]   that I had just discussed on Twitter
[00:59:44.560 --> 00:59:46.640]   in this iMessage conversation.
[00:59:46.640 --> 00:59:48.440]   So if Siri's already getting smart enough
[00:59:48.440 --> 00:59:51.040]   to kind of understand to whom I'm speaking
[00:59:51.040 --> 00:59:54.520]   and about what I'm speaking, I can see how this
[00:59:54.520 --> 00:59:56.800]   would easily be applied to notifications
[00:59:56.800 --> 01:00:00.120]   and to adding calendar events and making sure
[01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:01.600]   that I have the contacts that I need
[01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:03.280]   and maybe even sending out a message
[01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:05.520]   and it's like, wait, you're sending out a message about this
[01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:07.680]   but don't you also want to include this person?
[01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:08.960]   Of course I do Siri.
[01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:11.920]   So I think it's already starting to do that
[01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:15.520]   and iOS 11 right now is the entry into that
[01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:19.400]   and figuring out with the data that it gets on device,
[01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:21.440]   how it can use that and then hopefully we'll see
[01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:24.040]   that kind of breakout even more and see it applied
[01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:26.560]   to other features across iOS.
[01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:28.440]   I'd like to see more information clustered
[01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:31.200]   according to context with something like this
[01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:33.760]   just to give a real world example.
[01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:36.360]   I recently took my daughter's Daisy Trip camping.
[01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:39.200]   We caravan there in three cars
[01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:42.160]   and there was a great deal of texting.
[01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:43.840]   Hopefully people were just shouting their texts
[01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:45.400]   while they drove children.
[01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:48.440]   There was a great deal of texting to coordinate
[01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:51.320]   where to go on these back roads in Marin County
[01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:53.120]   and I'm thinking about this,
[01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:54.800]   do not disturb all driving feature
[01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:56.500]   and if there is a way to say here,
[01:00:56.500 --> 01:01:00.120]   this is related to the camping event today,
[01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:04.480]   please make sure that Betsy and Christine
[01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:06.160]   are able to text me.
[01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:08.440]   You just triggered your own Siri.
[01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:09.720]   (laughing)
[01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:10.760]   Of course I did, Siri.
[01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:12.720]   It knows your voice, it knows your voice.
[01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:13.560]   It knows your voice.
[01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:14.920]   You know, I'm going camping today,
[01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:16.240]   please make sure that Christine and Betsy
[01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:17.480]   can text me no matter what.
[01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:20.160]   Like that would be great if I could do something like that.
[01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:24.080]   And to be clear here, this is not turned on by default
[01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:26.000]   but it will sense when you're driving
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.200]   and then when you're done driving the first time
[01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:30.600]   it will say, would you like me to turn this feature on?
[01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:32.960]   And then you can also say, yes, I'm a passenger.
[01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:35.160]   I'm in a taxi, something like that.
[01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:36.000]   That's there too.
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:37.600]   - What I'd also be curious about is presumably
[01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:39.600]   if you can control when it's turned on and turned off,
[01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:42.480]   is your phone recording when it's turned on and turned off?
[01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:45.120]   - Recording what?
[01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:48.240]   - I mean, is your phone logging when you go into driving mode
[01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:49.240]   or is it not driving mode?
[01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:50.080]   - Oh yeah, I don't know.
[01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:50.920]   - And then the next question is,
[01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:52.800]   can your insurance companies get that data
[01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:54.480]   and figure out when you're driving?
[01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:55.800]   - Probably not because it's Apple
[01:01:55.800 --> 01:01:57.440]   and they're not gonna hand that data over
[01:01:57.440 --> 01:01:58.960]   but it probably does know.
[01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:02.200]   - If that data exists however, and that's now--
[01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:04.320]   - My guess is that it doesn't because it's Apple
[01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:06.720]   and that's a road they don't wanna go.
[01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:08.720]   They kinda don't wanna know, I suspect.
[01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:09.760]   - 'Cause if the data exists it,
[01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:10.920]   then someone's gonna ask about it
[01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:13.120]   so it's better just not to have that data.
[01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:15.640]   - Insurance companies, some offer up those little dongles
[01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:18.880]   you can plug into your OBD2 port, I don't know,
[01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:19.960]   OBD1 Kenobi port.
[01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:21.240]   - Yeah, that's the one.
[01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:23.000]   - Well, thank you, I thought that said.
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:24.360]   And it'll keep track of you know,
[01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:26.320]   you're zooming and you're breaking
[01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:28.400]   and when you're using your phone and when not
[01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:29.640]   and it's an opt in thing
[01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:32.480]   but you can end up saving money on your bill if you use it.
[01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:35.760]   So hopefully Apple isn't gonna get into that business.
[01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:37.360]   - No 'cause I'm thinking distracted driving
[01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:39.760]   is something that I'm sure insurance companies are approaching
[01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:41.600]   if not from a safety point of view from it.
[01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:43.920]   This is gonna cost us money point of view
[01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:46.160]   and so I expect that to collide with--
[01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:48.600]   - You get the iOS 11 discount on your auto insurance man.
[01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:49.440]   - I know.
[01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:52.280]   - I also sort of wondered if at some point of all phones
[01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:53.440]   have the sort of functionality
[01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:56.480]   whether states such as California
[01:02:56.480 --> 01:02:58.360]   that tell you you're not supposed to be using your phone
[01:02:58.360 --> 01:03:00.560]   anyway or at least touching it
[01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:02.000]   might think it was a good idea
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.300]   to have some sort of legislation
[01:03:04.300 --> 01:03:06.760]   tied to mandating that you use these features?
[01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:09.800]   - I would not be shocked if there's somebody at Apple
[01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:12.760]   who is planning iOS features and talks to people
[01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:15.400]   in various governments about what might be coming down
[01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:18.240]   to Pike, whether it's California or whether it's the EU,
[01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:21.080]   somebody saying we think that you could be smarter
[01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:23.160]   at doing this and trying to get out in front of it
[01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:24.880]   and maybe say look why don't we build on this feature
[01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:26.880]   that we already have rather than you inventing
[01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:29.520]   your own legislation about it, just use this as a model
[01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:31.560]   and we already built it so it's good for us, right?
[01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:34.120]   That could be, that wouldn't surprise me at all.
[01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:38.080]   Anything else in iOS 11 that struck you
[01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:39.840]   that you think we should mention here,
[01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:41.480]   that was the one, do not disturb all drivers.
[01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:43.200]   - Could appear payments for Apple Bay
[01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:44.200]   could potentially be on.
[01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:45.040]   - Oh yeah, oh yeah.
[01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:46.280]   - And it looks, when I've seen,
[01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:49.640]   it looks nicely done because it's not like a standalone app,
[01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:53.960]   it's built into iMessage and so if you mention money,
[01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:55.760]   you can then tap on the amount
[01:03:55.760 --> 01:03:57.480]   and it's just like another tap or two
[01:03:57.480 --> 01:04:01.000]   to send it potentially scary for somebody like Venmo
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.200]   and for the rest of PayPal as well.
[01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:05.560]   If it's easier to do it via Apple Pay.
[01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:09.240]   - And you just send them a little virtual card
[01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:13.320]   that contains the cash that's drawn on your Apple Pay account.
[01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:14.480]   - No, I don't know.
[01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:16.320]   Are there details on how easy it is
[01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:17.640]   to get that cash out of your account?
[01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:19.880]   Do you have to have it linked to another bank account?
[01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:21.560]   Is there a fee or a minimum balance?
[01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:24.400]   - You have it linked to like a debit card
[01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:26.000]   and you can retrieve it in the same way
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.920]   you can retrieve money from PayPal.
[01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:31.240]   I think Apple loves the idea of you leaving a lot of that money
[01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:32.080]   in there.
[01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:32.920]   - Of course they do.
[01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:34.840]   - And spending another things and spending it on stuff.
[01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:36.480]   - That's Apple becoming a defacto bank.
[01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:38.520]   - Yeah, just like the way whenever I tried to take money
[01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:41.040]   out of my PayPal account PayPal suggests
[01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:42.680]   I don't really really wanna do that.
[01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:43.680]   (laughs)
[01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:44.880]   - The idea of holding on to your money
[01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:46.000]   and not paying interest to you,
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.360]   I think is probably quite attractive.
[01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:49.080]   - Yeah, they wanna be the cash in your wallet, right?
[01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:49.920]   That's basically what they want to be.
[01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:53.200]   - So, wow, this basically turns Apple into a bank.
[01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:54.040]   - If they weren't already.
[01:04:54.040 --> 01:04:56.920]   - It's like any of those balance card companies
[01:04:56.920 --> 01:04:59.920]   that offer, you know, you can go in and buy one
[01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:01.840]   up next to the gift cards.
[01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:04.600]   So it works the same way, it's a balance card,
[01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:06.640]   which is a particular type of payment card.
[01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:09.080]   And yeah, Apple has that money.
[01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:10.440]   And it's, I think what is it called?
[01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:12.920]   Apple Pay Cash Card or something like that.
[01:05:12.920 --> 01:05:16.120]   And you can transfer it out and it's not clear
[01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:19.240]   how many days it'll take to transfer out or in.
[01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:23.280]   I assume they're going to push more for the cash style,
[01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:26.400]   which cash is, what is it, PayPal.
[01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:30.360]   Anyway, the cash app, which does quick transfers back
[01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:33.560]   and forth between your bank and not the one like
[01:05:33.560 --> 01:05:35.480]   some of the others that take a whole week
[01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:36.920]   to get it to transfer in and out.
[01:05:36.920 --> 01:05:41.840]   So I'm looking forward to it because where I have seen
[01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:44.960]   very slow adoption for other apps.
[01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:48.160]   And it seems like anytime I ever have to tell someone,
[01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:49.480]   you know, you use your mom as an example,
[01:05:49.480 --> 01:05:50.960]   again, I'll use my partner as an example,
[01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:52.520]   or I'm like, hey, can you download this app
[01:05:52.520 --> 01:05:54.120]   so I can send you money?
[01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:55.960]   They don't want to do that.
[01:05:55.960 --> 01:05:59.440]   But if it's already built in and it's already on device,
[01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:00.640]   then that makes it so much easier
[01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:02.240]   and more likely that they're going to do it.
[01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:05.200]   They're also less things that get in the way
[01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:07.840]   where like my sister, when I tried to send her money
[01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:10.680]   with Venmo, her credit union denied the use
[01:06:10.680 --> 01:06:12.040]   of Venmo completely.
[01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:14.280]   And it's just some silly things that, you know,
[01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:17.400]   do end up being super amounts of friction
[01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:20.560]   that I am looking forward to Apple Pay kind of kicking
[01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:22.240]   to the curb and saying, no, it's okay,
[01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:24.200]   we've got this taken care of.
[01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:26.920]   And I do think that it's, yeah, it's interesting
[01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:29.320]   that Apple's kind of pushing more toward becoming a bank,
[01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:31.480]   but it also means more regulations
[01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:32.440]   and things like that for them.
[01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:36.960]   So I'm happy that they've chosen to wade into those waters
[01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:39.320]   because it means that I can receive
[01:06:39.320 --> 01:06:42.320]   and send money a lot easier with most of the people
[01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:45.120]   that I would already be kind of exchanging money with.
[01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:49.560]   - The other big feature that is not a user feature,
[01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:51.920]   but will lead to lots of apps that people will go nuts for
[01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:56.920]   is ARKit, which is Apple's weighing into augmented reality.
[01:06:56.920 --> 01:06:59.200]   General perception was because Apple doesn't talk
[01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:01.320]   about what it's doing, that it wasn't really doing anything
[01:07:01.320 --> 01:07:03.280]   in terms of VR or AR.
[01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:06.160]   And they had stories for both on stage.
[01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:08.280]   I think ARKit was the more interesting
[01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:12.120]   because what they did was create tools for developers
[01:07:12.120 --> 01:07:15.520]   to build augmented reality products.
[01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:18.520]   In other words, the App Store will be full of augmented reality
[01:07:18.520 --> 01:07:22.400]   games and things and utilities perhaps come the release
[01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:23.240]   of iOS 11.
[01:07:23.240 --> 01:07:25.480]   And I talked to some people who are in the know
[01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:29.120]   about augmented reality and virtual sets
[01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:31.920]   and all sorts of other things who said that they were really
[01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:34.960]   blown away by the fact that Apple was essentially doing
[01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:36.720]   all of this heavy lifting for them
[01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:39.680]   so that all they have to do is build the apps
[01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:41.640]   because the ARKit stuff works in.
[01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:45.280]   And again, it's not very exciting because it's a developer
[01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:47.560]   announcement at a developer conference, mind you.
[01:07:47.560 --> 01:07:50.960]   But I just get this feeling that this is because Apple's got
[01:07:50.960 --> 01:07:53.800]   so many third party developers in the App Store now
[01:07:53.800 --> 01:07:56.240]   and that they just handed this toolkit to them
[01:07:56.240 --> 01:07:59.800]   that it's going to end up being way more impressive
[01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:02.040]   than if Apple just built a few AR things
[01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:03.760]   into the operating system, right?
[01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:06.000]   Into their into the camera app or something like that.
[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.200]   My colleague Mark Sullivan wrote about the fact
[01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:12.160]   that this may pre-stage the next iPhones.
[01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:15.440]   It's not unreasonable to think that if Apple starts building
[01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:19.040]   AR functionality into the operating system,
[01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:21.600]   it might want to give cameras to an iPhone
[01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:24.520]   to let it do even better stuff than you can do today
[01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:27.880]   with the one camera on the iPhone 7
[01:08:27.880 --> 01:08:31.200]   and the two cameras on the iPhone 7 Plus.
[01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:34.120]   - Yeah, one of the people I talked to said that they just,
[01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:35.880]   they were amazed at the math.
[01:08:35.880 --> 01:08:38.160]   They know the math that goes into some of those calculations.
[01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:40.120]   Like when they do the demo on the table
[01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:42.160]   and they come up with the table edge and all of that,
[01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:45.360]   and it's incredibly hard and that's a huge barrier
[01:08:45.360 --> 01:08:48.720]   to doing AR and that AR kit does that math for you.
[01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:50.320]   So you don't have to as a developer.
[01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:51.240]   It's a pretty big step.
[01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:53.800]   - I think that's a big thing.
[01:08:53.800 --> 01:08:54.720]   - Go ahead, go ahead, Lisa.
[01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:56.160]   - No, no, you might go ahead.
[01:08:56.160 --> 01:08:57.520]   - I was just gonna say, I think that's the big thing
[01:08:57.520 --> 01:09:00.240]   right there is how much of this stuff Apple's doing.
[01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:03.800]   I am in no way a developer, but I have been playing
[01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:08.800]   with AR kit and making little apps and models of stuff
[01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:11.040]   just to see what I could do.
[01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:12.800]   And like I said, I'm not a developer.
[01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:16.080]   I was basically just drag and drop to make this stuff happen.
[01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:18.220]   And I had my dogs like running under chairs
[01:09:18.220 --> 01:09:21.320]   that were only visible in my AR kit scene
[01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:24.360]   and setting down lamps and stuff like that
[01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:26.280]   and taking photos of them like running around them
[01:09:26.280 --> 01:09:27.640]   and interacting with them.
[01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:29.480]   And that is, it's incredible.
[01:09:29.480 --> 01:09:31.480]   I mean, it's genuinely incredible.
[01:09:31.480 --> 01:09:35.040]   And to think of what some different companies
[01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:36.400]   might create with this.
[01:09:36.400 --> 01:09:39.360]   And I was talking with a friend of the internet,
[01:09:39.360 --> 01:09:41.680]   Joe Steele about some of this stuff as well.
[01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:46.680]   And Joe does visual stuff in movies and television shows
[01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:50.120]   and talking about the possibilities there
[01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:55.120]   for doing interesting graphics with even like pre-made video.
[01:09:55.120 --> 01:09:57.560]   So you know, you might already have a video made,
[01:09:57.560 --> 01:10:00.440]   but could AR kit potentially like ingest a video
[01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:01.280]   that's already been made?
[01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:03.800]   And then use that and figure out control points.
[01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:05.800]   I mean, there's just a lot of possibility here.
[01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:09.680]   And yeah, Apple's taking a lot of the load off
[01:10:09.680 --> 01:10:11.320]   of developers to create that stuff
[01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:14.120]   so that someone who knows nothing about it
[01:10:14.120 --> 01:10:17.000]   can put a chair in their living room in no time at all.
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.400]   And you know, that laugh about the fact
[01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:21.160]   that my dogs are like running through it.
[01:10:21.160 --> 01:10:22.680]   It's just really interesting.
[01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:26.360]   And I'm looking forward to more pop-up books
[01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:28.320]   and I don't know Lego scenes
[01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:29.880]   and all the other stuff that they were showing.
[01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:33.000]   What I'm really hoping for is that pocket Minecraft
[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:36.000]   gets an AR kit extension
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.920]   and then I can like play Minecraft on my living room table.
[01:10:38.920 --> 01:10:40.960]   - Nice.
[01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:43.400]   Well, there's a little more from Apple
[01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:46.280]   and we've got more about Uber and Taylor Swift.
[01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:48.600]   I'm gonna keep forward promoting Taylor Swift.
[01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:50.440]   But I sense a great disturbance.
[01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:53.200]   This is part of that Obi-Wan Kenobi port I think Micah.
[01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:55.080]   And it may mean that Leo is back
[01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:57.160]   for another important message.
[01:10:57.160 --> 01:10:58.000]   - I feel it.
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.200]   - I'm gonna show at a great panel this week
[01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:02.920]   in just a second, but first a word.
[01:11:02.920 --> 01:11:05.560]   For those of you who lose things,
[01:11:05.560 --> 01:11:06.660]   raise your hand.
[01:11:06.660 --> 01:11:08.960]   (laughs)
[01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:10.760]   Was it Newsweek estimated that we spend
[01:11:10.760 --> 01:11:14.320]   about 50 minutes a day searching for stuff we know we've got,
[01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:17.040]   we know we own, but we just can't find.
[01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:18.960]   Well, now there's a solution.
[01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:21.000]   I mean, I understand life is supposed
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.440]   to be a journey of discovery.
[01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:25.240]   But do you really wanna spend it discovering
[01:11:25.240 --> 01:11:27.240]   where your keys were?
[01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:28.400]   (laughs)
[01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:30.280]   You never worry about losing anything.
[01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:33.360]   Your keys, your luggage, your bike, your purse.
[01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:38.400]   With Tracker, you pair this little coin size tracking device
[01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:40.440]   with your smartphone.
[01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:42.200]   And whenever you're separated,
[01:11:42.200 --> 01:11:44.000]   whether you leave your phone behind
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:45.800]   or leave your tracker behind,
[01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:47.160]   you'll get a warning and alert.
[01:11:47.160 --> 01:11:49.600]   And you can look on the Tracker app
[01:11:49.600 --> 01:11:52.280]   and see exactly where your keys, your wallet, your bags,
[01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:55.000]   your pets are at any given time.
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.920]   Use the Tracker app to find what you're looking for in seconds.
[01:11:57.920 --> 01:12:00.840]   You can track up to 10 devices on a phone.
[01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:04.000]   You can even track and ring the same device
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:05.840]   from multiple phones and Tracker counts.
[01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:07.720]   It's great for families.
[01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:10.200]   You can customize two-way separation alerts.
[01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:13.880]   That way you're notified before you leave an item behind.
[01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:14.840]   Now, if you lose your phone,
[01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:16.200]   you just press the button on the Tracker
[01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:18.280]   and or ask your Amazon Echo, by the way,
[01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:19.880]   which I really say,
[01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:22.120]   I won't say it because then I'll trigger it.
[01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:23.760]   But you could say, you know,
[01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:25.400]   "Whoa, where's my phone?"
[01:12:25.400 --> 01:12:26.400]   And it will tell you.
[01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:28.640]   Ring my phone, your phone will ring,
[01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:31.160]   even if it's silent, it'll ring.
[01:12:31.160 --> 01:12:33.000]   And if you need a little more help finding stuff,
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:36.160]   like maybe you leave stuff under furniture or incursions,
[01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:38.960]   you're gonna want this new one, the Tracker Pixel.
[01:12:38.960 --> 01:12:41.360]   It's got a ring of powerful LED lights around it
[01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:45.120]   so you can find your items in a flash, literally.
[01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:47.520]   And it comes in great seasonal colors.
[01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:49.640]   The best thing about Tracker from my mind
[01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:53.320]   is that there are four and a half million trackers out there.
[01:12:53.320 --> 01:12:56.520]   So it has the world's largest crowd source GPS network.
[01:12:56.520 --> 01:12:59.880]   It means even if somebody, you know, you lose your keys,
[01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:01.440]   somebody puts them in the lost and found
[01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:03.520]   or just puts them in their pocket by accident
[01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:05.680]   and takes them to Mononegro.
[01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:09.360]   The next time somebody with Tracker on their phone
[01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:12.680]   walks by your keys or any device with a tracker on it
[01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:15.560]   walks by your Tracker, it'll ping your phone and say,
[01:13:15.560 --> 01:13:17.960]   "Hey, I just saw your keys in Mononegro."
[01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:19.360]   - What? - What?
[01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:22.320]   - It is brilliant.
[01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:24.920]   Try Tracker today and by the way, no risk.

[01:13:47.200 --> 01:13:51.360]   and we thank Tracker so much for making TWIT possible.
[01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:54.920]   And by the way, all the drinks and food
[01:13:54.920 --> 01:13:57.400]   and the green room guys, they're provided by the Tracker.
[01:13:57.400 --> 01:13:58.240]   Just let you know.
[01:13:58.240 --> 01:14:00.840]   Actually kidding, there's no green room.
[01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:02.520]   Back to you, Jason!
[01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:03.800]   I'm so pleased.
[01:14:03.800 --> 01:14:07.200]   - I hope I didn't steal soda out of somebody's fridge
[01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:10.040]   or something then 'cause I did have a soda earlier.
[01:14:10.040 --> 01:14:13.080]   Provided by the staff, I guess, sorry, staff, sorry.
[01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:14.800]   - I don't have a green room here.
[01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:16.360]   - More free sodas, what's going on?
[01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:18.360]   - I know, I hate that sandwich.
[01:14:18.360 --> 01:14:19.160]   No, I didn't.
[01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:21.480]   That's, sorry, sorry to the producers.
[01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:24.520]   We have one more thing I wanna talk about about Apple
[01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:26.200]   and then I promise that's the last one.
[01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:27.640]   There's so much, there's so much.
[01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:29.040]   There's so many things I'm not even talking about now
[01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:30.000]   but one last one.
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:33.040]   I mentioned it earlier, that there's another product Apple
[01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:35.640]   announced that is not going to ship for six months,
[01:14:35.640 --> 01:14:36.760]   which is unusual for them.
[01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:38.360]   And it was a Mac of all things.
[01:14:38.360 --> 01:14:43.360]   It's the new iMac Pro, which is now famously a few weeks ago
[01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:48.000]   Apple did this thing where they met with a bunch of journalists
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.120]   and they said they're really committed to professional Mac users
[01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:51.840]   and they're going to do a new Mac Pro.
[01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:53.880]   And the way the story goes is that this iMac Pro
[01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:55.160]   was actually designed at a point
[01:14:55.160 --> 01:14:57.280]   when there wasn't gonna be a new Mac Pro
[01:14:57.280 --> 01:14:58.480]   and they needed to create something
[01:14:58.480 --> 01:15:00.640]   that was a replacement for the Mac Pro
[01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:03.000]   because they were gonna make people mad by discontinuing it.
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:04.760]   And the answer was what if we made a Mac Pro
[01:15:04.760 --> 01:15:05.880]   that was also an iMac?
[01:15:05.880 --> 01:15:08.240]   And it's gonna be in space gray
[01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:12.240]   because I guess that's a faster color than silver.
[01:15:12.240 --> 01:15:13.720]   And it's gonna come out in December
[01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:16.640]   and it starts at what eight cores,
[01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:18.920]   eight cores, and goes up to an 18 core Xeon
[01:15:18.920 --> 01:15:21.040]   and has AMD Radeon Vega graphics,
[01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:22.760]   up to 16 gigs of VRAM.
[01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:26.480]   It starts, starts mind you at five grand
[01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:29.880]   and I'm pretty sure you will easily be able to get one
[01:15:29.880 --> 01:15:34.480]   into the tens, into the five figures.
[01:15:34.480 --> 01:15:38.480]   So I'm curious what you all think about this one
[01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:41.320]   because it is an iMac unlike any other.
[01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:43.920]   And who's gonna buy this and who's this for?
[01:15:45.920 --> 01:15:48.040]   - Well, you guys are the Mac experts.
[01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:49.960]   So I'm a little worried about expressing an opinion.
[01:15:49.960 --> 01:15:52.880]   But again, please share.
[01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:54.720]   - I mean, that said, I sort of got the sense
[01:15:54.720 --> 01:15:58.080]   from all the Mac news and they announced an awful lot of Macs
[01:15:58.080 --> 01:15:58.920]   at this event.
[01:15:58.920 --> 01:16:01.120]   All of them were minor bumps,
[01:16:01.120 --> 01:16:04.480]   but there was this long period where people
[01:16:04.480 --> 01:16:06.120]   were even talking about the possibility
[01:16:06.120 --> 01:16:08.040]   that the Mac was being phased out
[01:16:08.040 --> 01:16:09.560]   and many, many people were complaining
[01:16:09.560 --> 01:16:13.280]   about the componentry in Macs being slow and out of date.
[01:16:14.480 --> 01:16:16.320]   And I feel like maybe they said,
[01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:20.320]   you think we can't put really powerful components into a Mac,
[01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:22.040]   fine, we'll take the iMac.
[01:16:22.040 --> 01:16:23.200]   - Fine.
[01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:26.680]   - And we will put as much powerful stuff into it as we can
[01:16:26.680 --> 01:16:29.480]   a point where there might be a fairly small audience
[01:16:29.480 --> 01:16:32.880]   for this system, but nobody can again say
[01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:35.120]   that we're not gonna build powerful Macs.
[01:16:35.120 --> 01:16:36.320]   - Yeah, I think they're willing to have this
[01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:38.000]   not sell a huge number,
[01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:41.120]   which was always the argument about the Mac Pro.
[01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:42.720]   Like you need to have something at the high end
[01:16:42.720 --> 01:16:44.520]   even if you don't sell a lot of them.
[01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:46.280]   Micah, what do you think?
[01:16:46.280 --> 01:16:48.600]   - Well, first of all, it is absolutely gorgeous
[01:16:48.600 --> 01:16:51.600]   and I was drooling looking at it
[01:16:51.600 --> 01:16:53.040]   whenever it first kind of showed up.
[01:16:53.040 --> 01:16:54.680]   I think this is really exciting.
[01:16:54.680 --> 01:16:57.320]   I've always liked the iMac design.
[01:16:57.320 --> 01:17:00.720]   And so knowing this story that you just told now
[01:17:00.720 --> 01:17:03.320]   about how this was gonna be the replacement,
[01:17:03.320 --> 01:17:05.080]   I would have been happy.
[01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:07.680]   Unfortunately, a lot of the people that I would imagine
[01:17:07.680 --> 01:17:10.960]   both you and I follow on Twitter would be very displeased
[01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:12.640]   with the fact that an Apple would be doomed
[01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:14.880]   because they weren't releasing a Mac Pro.
[01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:17.640]   So now they are and so maybe they're not doomed
[01:17:17.640 --> 01:17:18.960]   but probably still are doomed.
[01:17:18.960 --> 01:17:23.800]   And this iMac Pro is just, it's really, really neat.
[01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:27.440]   It's out of my price range probably,
[01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:31.800]   but it is certainly a device that I would enjoy owning
[01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:35.240]   just because I mean, I do do a lot of video production work
[01:17:35.240 --> 01:17:37.880]   and photo manipulation and stuff like that.
[01:17:37.880 --> 01:17:40.480]   And it would be really nice to have
[01:17:40.480 --> 01:17:44.640]   and a desktop computer that can do all of that stuff and more.
[01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:49.640]   I think what ended up being more of a highlight
[01:17:49.640 --> 01:17:52.640]   for everybody who I was paying attention to
[01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:55.600]   was the fact that you've also got the Space Gray
[01:17:55.600 --> 01:17:57.720]   Magic Keyboard and Magic Trekpad.
[01:17:57.720 --> 01:18:00.680]   And that was interesting.
[01:18:00.680 --> 01:18:03.800]   Apple certainly sees this as kind of like
[01:18:03.800 --> 01:18:06.160]   its own little package of awesomeness.
[01:18:06.160 --> 01:18:08.480]   And I loved the point when they were like,
[01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:10.240]   we didn't just stop at this many cores.
[01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:13.080]   We also offer this many cores and not just that,
[01:18:13.080 --> 01:18:14.800]   but even this many cores.
[01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:17.600]   So, you know, there's a market out there,
[01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:19.200]   a very small market, but yeah,
[01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:20.800]   I think Apple's gonna be fine with that.
[01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:23.840]   This is a device made for the particular person
[01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:26.400]   that wants it and they will buy it
[01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:28.360]   and they will probably be happy with it.
[01:18:28.360 --> 01:18:29.440]   And that's great.
[01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:33.640]   I would love to see the Space Gray come to more iMacs,
[01:18:33.640 --> 01:18:36.560]   but until that happens, I will just have to
[01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:38.760]   stare longingly at this new iMac Pro.
[01:18:38.760 --> 01:18:41.640]   Because if you're gonna spend $5,000 on an iMac,
[01:18:41.640 --> 01:18:43.120]   you get the special color.
[01:18:43.120 --> 01:18:44.760]   I think that's definitely the case.
[01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:47.880]   Just to be clear, there will be a new Mac Pro as well.
[01:18:47.880 --> 01:18:49.320]   Apple said that a few weeks ago.
[01:18:49.320 --> 01:18:50.200]   This is not that.
[01:18:50.200 --> 01:18:51.440]   There will also be one of those.
[01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:52.680]   And that'll be interesting to see.
[01:18:52.680 --> 01:18:55.600]   How do you differentiate this iMac Pro from the Mac Pro?
[01:18:55.600 --> 01:18:58.080]   Presumably because it won't have a screen
[01:18:58.080 --> 01:19:01.680]   and hopefully will be more configurable and have--
[01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:03.840]   - Space Gray squared for the color.
[01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:04.680]   - That's right.
[01:19:04.680 --> 01:19:06.320]   And other things that in a standalone computer
[01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:07.760]   you can get that you can't get
[01:19:07.760 --> 01:19:09.880]   in an all-in-one that's attached to a big screen.
[01:19:09.880 --> 01:19:12.320]   And that'll be, I actually think that could be really great
[01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:15.480]   to see Apple being freed from a lot of these needs
[01:19:15.480 --> 01:19:17.040]   that they have in so many other computers
[01:19:17.040 --> 01:19:19.840]   to just make something that is utterly devoted to people
[01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:21.380]   who wanna have a box they can open up
[01:19:21.380 --> 01:19:22.560]   and plug something new in.
[01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:23.800]   And hopefully that's what we'll get.
[01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:27.520]   And not just a iMac Pro with the screen taken off of it.
[01:19:27.520 --> 01:19:31.040]   But it's, Harry, you alluded to the other Macs
[01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:32.120]   that were announced.
[01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:35.080]   This is all part of the same story that's been happening
[01:19:35.080 --> 01:19:37.640]   since late last year where, especially the professional
[01:19:37.640 --> 01:19:41.080]   core of Apple's Mac user base was complaining that
[01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:42.840]   the systems weren't being updated often enough.
[01:19:42.840 --> 01:19:45.760]   The Mac Pro had gone a couple of years without an update
[01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:48.160]   and they were questioning Apple's commitment.
[01:19:48.160 --> 01:19:51.400]   And basically the other Mac releases that happened
[01:19:51.400 --> 01:19:55.480]   were notable only in the sense that they happened
[01:19:55.480 --> 01:19:57.040]   and that Apple was sending a message
[01:19:57.040 --> 01:19:58.480]   that they were going to do these updates.
[01:19:58.480 --> 01:20:00.480]   They updated those MacBook Pros that they announced
[01:20:00.480 --> 01:20:02.720]   nine months ago, they shipped nine months ago.
[01:20:02.720 --> 01:20:04.800]   And that in itself is not that exciting
[01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:08.560]   but there had been a long time when Apple had let
[01:20:08.560 --> 01:20:11.520]   these systems go for more than a year without doing
[01:20:11.520 --> 01:20:14.120]   a processor update even though we knew those
[01:20:14.120 --> 01:20:15.840]   Intel processors were out there.
[01:20:15.840 --> 01:20:18.960]   And so in some ways, yes, those things got speed bumps
[01:20:18.960 --> 01:20:20.920]   but also it was Apple sending a message
[01:20:20.920 --> 01:20:23.520]   that we are going to update these computers.
[01:20:23.520 --> 01:20:24.360]   Which is a good one.
[01:20:24.360 --> 01:20:27.040]   - In Mac update time nine months is really quite short
[01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:30.600]   'cause normally they're perfectly happy for windows PCs
[01:20:30.600 --> 01:20:32.920]   to have the latest and greatest processors
[01:20:32.920 --> 01:20:36.040]   and for Macs to get kind of long in the tooth.
[01:20:36.040 --> 01:20:37.520]   - But they let it go a little too long I think.
[01:20:37.520 --> 01:20:39.160]   It made people cranky.
[01:20:39.160 --> 01:20:40.560]   - Yes, and people have complained about this
[01:20:40.560 --> 01:20:43.160]   at least for as long as I've been paying attention to Macs
[01:20:43.160 --> 01:20:45.840]   but I think the discontent was getting more and more serious.
[01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:49.040]   And it can't be much fun if you're Apple
[01:20:49.040 --> 01:20:52.880]   to read people talking about whether there might not
[01:20:52.880 --> 01:20:56.400]   be a Mac someday which I think is very far from any truth.
[01:20:56.400 --> 01:20:59.440]   They're going to confront any time in a very long time
[01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:02.680]   to come but I think Apple did want to make a statement.
[01:21:02.680 --> 01:21:03.520]   - Yeah.
[01:21:03.520 --> 01:21:08.000]   - So, New Mac Pro next year, I Mac Pro this December.
[01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:09.120]   Stocking stuffer.
[01:21:09.120 --> 01:21:11.800]   (laughing)
[01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:14.040]   It's a big stocking and you got to have $5,000
[01:21:14.040 --> 01:21:16.160]   at least to stuff it and really if you want it.
[01:21:16.160 --> 01:21:17.240]   - Spacecree stocking.
[01:21:17.240 --> 01:21:18.320]   - Spacecree stocking, yeah.
[01:21:18.320 --> 01:21:19.160]   They'll have it.
[01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:21.080]   It has to be in the space gray.
[01:21:21.080 --> 01:21:21.920]   Anyway.
[01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:22.760]   - It's your fancy shop now.
[01:21:22.760 --> 01:21:24.840]   - New Mac's, New Mac book as well.
[01:21:24.840 --> 01:21:27.160]   The MacBook Air got a few more megahertz.
[01:21:27.160 --> 01:21:29.280]   I think literally they may be running out of the chips
[01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:30.960]   that it's a broad well I think.
[01:21:30.960 --> 01:21:33.480]   So, they're really running out of chips to put in it
[01:21:33.480 --> 01:21:35.000]   but they found some.
[01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:36.200]   So, they're going to keep selling that
[01:21:36.200 --> 01:21:37.280]   in my understanding of the MacBook Air.
[01:21:37.280 --> 01:21:40.160]   Actually, one of Apple's best selling computers
[01:21:40.160 --> 01:21:42.520]   even now because it's $9.99.
[01:21:42.520 --> 01:21:44.240]   Let's, okay.
[01:21:44.240 --> 01:21:47.720]   I'm going to say now it's safe to come out of your bunker.
[01:21:47.720 --> 01:21:49.720]   We're going to stop talking about Apple.
[01:21:49.720 --> 01:21:53.040]   Let's instead move on to a happier subject.
[01:21:53.040 --> 01:21:54.040]   That was sarcasm.
[01:21:54.040 --> 01:21:55.600]   Let's talk about Uber's bad week.
[01:21:55.600 --> 01:21:57.800]   (laughing)
[01:21:57.800 --> 01:22:00.520]   As we speak, as we record this,
[01:22:00.520 --> 01:22:03.280]   apparently there is a secret emergency board meeting.
[01:22:03.280 --> 01:22:05.640]   Well, people are tweeting from inside it maybe.
[01:22:05.640 --> 01:22:08.040]   So, we're not sure how secret it could be.
[01:22:08.040 --> 01:22:08.880]   Everybody knows.
[01:22:08.880 --> 01:22:12.160]   We don't know exactly what's going on involving potential.
[01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:17.320]   It's possible Travis Kalenick might take a leave of absence.
[01:22:17.320 --> 01:22:18.920]   It's possible that Emil Michael,
[01:22:18.920 --> 01:22:21.040]   who's one of the more controversial figures
[01:22:21.040 --> 01:22:22.320]   might be let go.
[01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:23.280]   We don't really know.
[01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:24.760]   There are just rumors about that right now.
[01:22:24.760 --> 01:22:27.640]   You, in the future watching this know more than we do
[01:22:27.640 --> 01:22:28.480]   about it.
[01:22:28.480 --> 01:22:32.040]   But even without that, it's been a tough week for a company
[01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:35.080]   that kind of is defining what a tough week looks like
[01:22:35.080 --> 01:22:35.960]   at Uber.
[01:22:35.960 --> 01:22:37.920]   They fired more than 20 employees
[01:22:37.920 --> 01:22:40.440]   as part of their ongoing sexual harassment probe.
[01:22:40.440 --> 01:22:46.040]   It's a bad scene.
[01:22:46.040 --> 01:22:48.440]   Travis Kalenick, the CEO,
[01:22:48.440 --> 01:22:51.120]   we released some very nice memos
[01:22:51.120 --> 01:22:56.120]   about the sex parties being held at their 2013 Miami offsite.
[01:22:56.760 --> 01:22:59.280]   He's actually trying to get his employees to feel sorry for him
[01:22:59.280 --> 01:23:00.880]   because as the boss of the company, he was--
[01:23:00.880 --> 01:23:02.080]   - He can't have sex with my employees.
[01:23:02.080 --> 01:23:03.400]   - He was not allowed. - He was not allowed.
[01:23:03.400 --> 01:23:04.240]   - He was so unfair.
[01:23:04.240 --> 01:23:05.080]   - Yes, yes.
[01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:05.920]   - That was basically the--
[01:23:05.920 --> 01:23:07.040]   - Actual memo. - Yeah.
[01:23:07.040 --> 01:23:09.840]   - So, you know, I don't know.
[01:23:09.840 --> 01:23:12.760]   Like, kudos to Uber for defining this category.
[01:23:12.760 --> 01:23:15.160]   That's pretty cool that you can use an app to find a card
[01:23:15.160 --> 01:23:16.000]   that picks you up.
[01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.360]   And it's a wired to your credit card.
[01:23:18.360 --> 01:23:22.680]   But like, Harry, let's all start with you.
[01:23:22.680 --> 01:23:25.440]   Can this company be saved from itself?
[01:23:25.440 --> 01:23:27.040]   Or is it just too much?
[01:23:27.040 --> 01:23:28.400]   Is there just too much?
[01:23:28.400 --> 01:23:29.920]   This may be what they're talking about in the board meeting.
[01:23:29.920 --> 01:23:31.560]   We can have our own little Uber board meeting here.
[01:23:31.560 --> 01:23:35.200]   But what do you think about like Uber's culture
[01:23:35.200 --> 01:23:39.520]   and this just endless torrent of disastrous news?
[01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:41.160]   - And I mean, on top of all this,
[01:23:41.160 --> 01:23:42.640]   there's this other basic question,
[01:23:42.640 --> 01:23:47.360]   which is even if it didn't have all these self-inflicted problems,
[01:23:47.360 --> 01:23:49.480]   how real a business is Uber a long time?
[01:23:49.480 --> 01:23:52.520]   Our friend, Glenn Fleischman, is always saying that--
[01:23:52.520 --> 01:23:53.680]   - Peacuber. - Peacuber.
[01:23:53.680 --> 01:23:55.640]   That Uber was gonna collapse eventually anyway,
[01:23:55.640 --> 01:23:58.680]   just because what it offers is sort of a commodity
[01:23:58.680 --> 01:24:00.720]   and the network effects it has because it's so big,
[01:24:00.720 --> 01:24:02.520]   maybe you're not all that powerful.
[01:24:02.520 --> 01:24:05.560]   - Lyft can offer essentially exactly what Uber offers, right?
[01:24:05.560 --> 01:24:08.880]   - And venture capitalists have been subsidizing
[01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:12.680]   all of our inexpensive rides on Uber for a long time.
[01:24:12.680 --> 01:24:14.200]   - Let me thank them.
[01:24:14.200 --> 01:24:16.320]   - So they have some problems that might be basic
[01:24:16.320 --> 01:24:18.200]   to what they do, but they also have all these problems
[01:24:18.200 --> 01:24:21.240]   they created, some of which date back a long time
[01:24:21.240 --> 01:24:23.400]   are coming back to hunt them.
[01:24:23.400 --> 01:24:27.360]   Poor Travis Kalenitz, parents were in this horrible voting accident.
[01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:31.240]   Bendonism, his mother died and his father was badly injured
[01:24:31.240 --> 01:24:33.920]   if he does take a leave of absence.
[01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:35.480]   Maybe that's a factor there.
[01:24:35.480 --> 01:24:37.080]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:24:37.080 --> 01:24:39.280]   - It's always dangerous to say that a company
[01:24:39.280 --> 01:24:42.760]   is in such deep trouble that it's not solvable,
[01:24:42.760 --> 01:24:46.720]   but you do have to wonder how they get out of this.
[01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:50.280]   They do have the same voting structure.
[01:24:51.280 --> 01:24:53.960]   But a lot of other companies like Google and Facebook
[01:24:53.960 --> 01:24:56.320]   have used very successfully where it's very hard
[01:24:56.320 --> 01:24:59.200]   to get them to do anything that a handful of people,
[01:24:59.200 --> 01:25:01.920]   including the CEO, don't want to do.
[01:25:01.920 --> 01:25:05.240]   So I think some of this comes down to Travis Kalenitz
[01:25:05.240 --> 01:25:07.920]   agreeing to radical change if it happens.
[01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:10.320]   And I don't think it's in the cards
[01:25:10.320 --> 01:25:13.360]   that he would just be forced out, most likely.
[01:25:13.360 --> 01:25:16.880]   - They also hired this week, Bosema St. John,
[01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:19.160]   who was one of the marketing people on Apple Music.
[01:25:19.160 --> 01:25:20.000]   - Good news.
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:21.800]   - She's a chief brand officer.
[01:25:21.800 --> 01:25:24.640]   - She was the highlight of the WWDC 2016.
[01:25:24.640 --> 01:25:25.560]   - A year ago, right.
[01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:30.080]   And I think this strikes me as a sign of a company
[01:25:30.080 --> 01:25:33.600]   that does realize that they need to really change
[01:25:33.600 --> 01:25:36.200]   their culture and brand and impression.
[01:25:36.200 --> 01:25:39.440]   The question is like, will they be able to do it?
[01:25:39.440 --> 01:25:41.400]   - Have you heard of the glass cliff?
[01:25:41.400 --> 01:25:44.280]   'Cause it's a thing that gets reported on in business media
[01:25:44.280 --> 01:25:48.080]   where typically if a company is in a boatload of trouble,
[01:25:48.080 --> 01:25:50.480]   that's when you hire the women executives.
[01:25:50.480 --> 01:25:51.560]   Because-- - Right.
[01:25:51.560 --> 01:25:52.400]   - Seriously. - Yes.
[01:25:52.400 --> 01:25:53.680]   - And they call it the glass cliff.
[01:25:53.680 --> 01:25:56.080]   And-- - It's the unwinnable, yeah.
[01:25:56.080 --> 01:25:58.320]   - It happened to Yahoo and GM and Xerox.
[01:25:58.320 --> 01:25:59.160]   - Yes.
[01:25:59.160 --> 01:26:02.000]   And the idea is this way in HP even.
[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:02.840]   - In HP.
[01:26:02.840 --> 01:26:04.400]   - And this way if they turn it around, hooray,
[01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:07.200]   it's great and if not, then it can,
[01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:08.960]   oh, you can blame it on their management style
[01:26:08.960 --> 01:26:11.200]   or you can blame it on their inexperience or what have you.
[01:26:11.200 --> 01:26:15.520]   But the glass cliff is a fairly well-known way
[01:26:15.520 --> 01:26:18.000]   of trying to change corporate culture
[01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.200]   and make changes that so it's like,
[01:26:20.200 --> 01:26:22.120]   this company's no longer a horror show to women
[01:26:22.120 --> 01:26:23.480]   'cause we have five of them now.
[01:26:23.480 --> 01:26:25.760]   And then if the company fails anyway,
[01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:28.040]   oh gosh, those women sure didn't know what they were doing.
[01:26:28.040 --> 01:26:30.760]   So-- - Oh my Lord.
[01:26:30.760 --> 01:26:31.600]   - Yeah, no, so any-- - Sorry,
[01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:32.880]   that's really frustrating.
[01:26:32.880 --> 01:26:34.360]   - No, any time they start announcing
[01:26:34.360 --> 01:26:36.000]   high profile women executives,
[01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:37.520]   that's when you start looking at the balance sheet
[01:26:37.520 --> 01:26:39.160]   and the fundamentals and you ask,
[01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:40.720]   when are the layoffs coming?
[01:26:40.720 --> 01:26:42.760]   What business units are going to get set down?
[01:26:42.760 --> 01:26:44.400]   When do you set the death clock?
[01:26:44.400 --> 01:26:47.160]   - 'Cause the idea here is that, you know, again,
[01:26:47.160 --> 01:26:50.160]   if they hire women executives because they want
[01:26:50.160 --> 01:26:51.280]   to hire them, that's great,
[01:26:51.280 --> 01:26:53.200]   but there is this risk that some companies hire them
[01:26:53.200 --> 01:26:55.480]   as more of a-- - It's a protective cover.
[01:26:55.480 --> 01:26:56.480]   - Yeah, or in the case of Uber,
[01:26:56.480 --> 01:26:58.920]   which has had these terrible stories about their culture
[01:26:58.920 --> 01:27:00.680]   and how they treat women-- - The engineers, yeah.
[01:27:00.680 --> 01:27:03.280]   - Yeah, the argument from their side is that
[01:27:03.280 --> 01:27:04.560]   this is because of a lack of women
[01:27:04.560 --> 01:27:05.920]   and positions of power at Uber.
[01:27:05.920 --> 01:27:08.880]   - And this is not meant as a slam on Bozum of St. John
[01:27:08.880 --> 01:27:10.280]   by any stretch of the imagination.
[01:27:10.280 --> 01:27:13.080]   She has an incredible record with what she's done.
[01:27:13.080 --> 01:27:15.400]   She's got a strong 20-year record of achievement,
[01:27:15.400 --> 01:27:18.400]   of finding innovative ways to push the product
[01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:20.080]   and raise branding awareness,
[01:27:20.080 --> 01:27:23.040]   and she's clearly very good at what she does.
[01:27:23.040 --> 01:27:25.200]   This is more a reflection of what
[01:27:25.200 --> 01:27:27.400]   Uber's current management may be thinking
[01:27:27.400 --> 01:27:29.800]   as they scramble to rearrange the jik chairs
[01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:31.600]   anymore, pleasing configuration,
[01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:33.840]   and get back to the VCs who have--
[01:27:33.840 --> 01:27:38.440]   They've lost nearly $5 billion in the last two years.
[01:27:38.440 --> 01:27:40.120]   And at some point, the people who said,
[01:27:40.120 --> 01:27:42.680]   "Yeah, you managed to burn through $4.8 billion
[01:27:42.680 --> 01:27:43.520]   "over two years.
[01:27:43.520 --> 01:27:44.360]   "They're gonna begin to wonder
[01:27:44.360 --> 01:27:46.560]   "if there's ever a return on investment on this,
[01:27:46.560 --> 01:27:48.840]   "or if this is basically my space on wheels."
[01:27:48.840 --> 01:27:49.680]   - So--
[01:27:49.680 --> 01:27:52.560]   - I have to say, so my father-in-law is actually
[01:27:52.560 --> 01:27:54.840]   a driver for both Uber and Lyft,
[01:27:54.840 --> 01:27:56.520]   and he said that after the,
[01:27:56.520 --> 01:28:00.040]   before the blog post from the engineer
[01:28:00.040 --> 01:28:03.040]   who dealt with all the terrible sort of sexual harassment
[01:28:03.040 --> 01:28:05.000]   at Uber and quit,
[01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:09.960]   his rides were 80/20 Uber and Lyft.
[01:28:09.960 --> 01:28:12.760]   And he said after that blog post in the immediate aftermath,
[01:28:12.760 --> 01:28:14.680]   it was 80/20 the other way.
[01:28:14.680 --> 01:28:17.560]   But he said it settled back to 50/50.
[01:28:17.560 --> 01:28:19.280]   And that's an example of, you know,
[01:28:19.280 --> 01:28:21.680]   Uber's attachment to their audience
[01:28:21.680 --> 01:28:24.080]   is not necessarily particularly strong.
[01:28:24.080 --> 01:28:26.120]   There are other options out there.
[01:28:26.120 --> 01:28:27.320]   - What town is he in?
[01:28:27.320 --> 01:28:28.160]   - Portland.
[01:28:28.160 --> 01:28:32.120]   - Yeah, somewhat tech-y, but not the same degree we are.
[01:28:32.120 --> 01:28:32.960]   - Yeah.
[01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:34.920]   And they have a fairly strong taxi market there too,
[01:28:34.920 --> 01:28:36.880]   because for a while you couldn't use Lyft or Uber
[01:28:36.880 --> 01:28:38.840]   in Portland, you had to use taxi magic,
[01:28:38.840 --> 01:28:40.080]   which is what curbed now.
[01:28:40.080 --> 01:28:41.280]   But again, there's another example
[01:28:41.280 --> 01:28:42.960]   where the taxi industry adapts too.
[01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:46.800]   - I remember Uber kicks started the year by the weekend
[01:28:46.800 --> 01:28:48.240]   that we had the protests at the airport
[01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:49.600]   so for the punitive travel ban,
[01:28:49.600 --> 01:28:51.520]   all the New York cabbies joined in the protests.
[01:28:51.520 --> 01:28:53.640]   And that's when Uber began paying people with,
[01:28:53.640 --> 01:28:55.760]   "We're still giving rides from the airport if you want."
[01:28:55.760 --> 01:28:58.040]   And that was just a massive PR misstep.
[01:28:58.040 --> 01:28:59.480]   That's how they launched the year.
[01:28:59.480 --> 01:29:00.320]   - Yes.
[01:29:00.320 --> 01:29:01.920]   - And it has only continued to go--
[01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:04.480]   - That weeks, bad months, bad years.
[01:29:04.480 --> 01:29:06.280]   Yeah.
[01:29:06.280 --> 01:29:09.080]   - And even before all the latest stuff,
[01:29:09.080 --> 01:29:11.480]   even before all this stuff kind of hit,
[01:29:11.480 --> 01:29:16.480]   I was at CES and was taking Uber at the time.
[01:29:16.480 --> 01:29:19.520]   So this was not last CES, but the one before that.
[01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:21.440]   And I remember talking to one of the drivers,
[01:29:21.440 --> 01:29:23.280]   'cause it seems like it's something that you always do.
[01:29:23.280 --> 01:29:24.400]   How long have you been driving
[01:29:24.400 --> 01:29:26.000]   when you have no idea what to talk about?
[01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:27.920]   And ended up getting into a conversation
[01:29:27.920 --> 01:29:30.040]   because they were both Lyft and Uber
[01:29:30.040 --> 01:29:32.960]   and talking about the differences between both of them.
[01:29:32.960 --> 01:29:35.560]   And so I ended up asking the question,
[01:29:35.560 --> 01:29:36.880]   which one do you like more?
[01:29:36.880 --> 01:29:39.040]   They said Lyft, and I asked, you know, why?
[01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:42.280]   What is it about Lyft and Uber that makes Lyft different?
[01:29:42.280 --> 01:29:44.600]   They talked about, you know, they felt more like
[01:29:44.600 --> 01:29:46.760]   they were treated as a person at Lyft,
[01:29:46.760 --> 01:29:47.920]   among some other things.
[01:29:47.920 --> 01:29:49.240]   So for the rest of that weekend,
[01:29:49.240 --> 01:29:53.000]   I made sure to ask every single Uber/Lift driver
[01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.440]   that I rode with that same question.
[01:29:55.440 --> 01:29:58.400]   And it was the same answer every single time
[01:29:58.400 --> 01:30:00.240]   that they preferred Lyft and it was that Lyft
[01:30:00.240 --> 01:30:03.000]   made them feel more like they were a real person.
[01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:08.000]   So, I mean, Uber, it seems like, has had an issue
[01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.840]   in all of these ways for quite a while,
[01:30:10.840 --> 01:30:13.520]   even before all this kind of stuff hit the fan
[01:30:13.520 --> 01:30:16.480]   and before we knew about it.
[01:30:16.480 --> 01:30:18.920]   And it's interesting that, you know,
[01:30:18.920 --> 01:30:22.080]   of course these companies rely on their drivers
[01:30:22.080 --> 01:30:24.280]   who they don't consider actual workers for them,
[01:30:24.280 --> 01:30:25.720]   but just contractors.
[01:30:25.720 --> 01:30:29.400]   And also the people who decide to ride for them.
[01:30:29.400 --> 01:30:32.320]   And both of those things can change just like that
[01:30:32.320 --> 01:30:36.520]   if other options provide better options.
[01:30:36.520 --> 01:30:38.960]   If other options provide better opportunities
[01:30:38.960 --> 01:30:41.240]   for the drivers and for the riders,
[01:30:41.240 --> 01:30:42.840]   then Uber is nothing.
[01:30:42.840 --> 01:30:46.400]   And so, I mean, I keep asking what,
[01:30:46.400 --> 01:30:49.880]   what, Bozama St. John is obviously incredible
[01:30:49.880 --> 01:30:52.560]   and I think she's fantastic.
[01:30:52.560 --> 01:30:57.560]   But what at this point, can anybody in that position
[01:30:57.560 --> 01:31:02.160]   or any position in the company do to make all
[01:31:02.160 --> 01:31:04.400]   this stuff suddenly acceptable?
[01:31:04.400 --> 01:31:06.240]   'Cause I don't think that'll ever be acceptable.
[01:31:06.240 --> 01:31:08.360]   So, it's just, it's interesting.
[01:31:08.360 --> 01:31:10.080]   I don't know what their next steps are,
[01:31:10.080 --> 01:31:12.120]   but certainly not the email's getting out there
[01:31:12.120 --> 01:31:13.040]   about the Miami party.
[01:31:13.040 --> 01:31:13.960]   That's not good.
[01:31:13.960 --> 01:31:16.960]   - It's clear that the long game, Travis Kalenik's
[01:31:16.960 --> 01:31:19.200]   long game here is self-driving cars.
[01:31:19.200 --> 01:31:21.400]   Like his long game is not having drivers.
[01:31:21.400 --> 01:31:23.560]   That's how they solve, how they deal with drivers
[01:31:23.560 --> 01:31:26.400]   who are contractors, is they just get rid of all the drivers.
[01:31:26.400 --> 01:31:28.800]   And that's why they made their deal with Carnegie Mellon
[01:31:28.800 --> 01:31:30.160]   and they've been doing a lot of investment
[01:31:30.160 --> 01:31:31.320]   in self-driving cars.
[01:31:31.320 --> 01:31:33.880]   They wanna ultimately be a car service
[01:31:33.880 --> 01:31:35.600]   that is entirely automated.
[01:31:35.600 --> 01:31:38.360]   The challenge, as with so many things in Silicon Valley,
[01:31:38.360 --> 01:31:40.480]   is you got your cocktail napkin,
[01:31:40.480 --> 01:31:42.520]   you got some venture funding on one side,
[01:31:42.520 --> 01:31:44.920]   you got the world domination on the other side,
[01:31:44.920 --> 01:31:47.320]   and in the middle, there's a cloud with a question mark in it
[01:31:47.320 --> 01:31:49.560]   and that's sort of the challenge,
[01:31:49.560 --> 01:31:52.640]   is how do you get from here to there?
[01:31:52.640 --> 01:31:55.800]   And this is where they are right now.
[01:31:55.800 --> 01:31:58.480]   - That also created yet another problem they have,
[01:31:58.480 --> 01:32:01.520]   which is they're being sued by Waymo,
[01:32:01.520 --> 01:32:03.480]   which is Google's self-driving car units.
[01:32:03.480 --> 01:32:06.560]   - Yes, because they took one of their key executives away.
[01:32:06.560 --> 01:32:08.120]   - And he's--
[01:32:08.120 --> 01:32:11.520]   - via startup, that was where he took his intellectual property.
[01:32:11.520 --> 01:32:12.640]   - And at least according to Waymo,
[01:32:12.640 --> 01:32:14.880]   he brought a lot of very specific stuff
[01:32:14.880 --> 01:32:16.560]   he created at Google with him.
[01:32:16.560 --> 01:32:17.720]   - Right, and I had to fire him.
[01:32:17.720 --> 01:32:21.080]   That was not this most recent bad week for Google.
[01:32:21.080 --> 01:32:24.560]   - That was the previous-- - Previously on "Oopers Bad Week."
[01:32:24.560 --> 01:32:26.640]   Yeah, so it's a, it's a, what a mess.
[01:32:26.640 --> 01:32:27.480]   What a mess.
[01:32:27.480 --> 01:32:29.120]   - Full credit to Bozemus,
[01:32:29.120 --> 01:32:31.600]   since she must feel like she's got,
[01:32:31.600 --> 01:32:33.920]   she's had a conversation, I imagine she asked those questions
[01:32:33.920 --> 01:32:36.040]   and probably she got a pretty good deal
[01:32:36.040 --> 01:32:37.080]   to come work there too,
[01:32:37.080 --> 01:32:40.040]   given that she had a pretty good deal at Apple, I assume.
[01:32:40.040 --> 01:32:43.360]   Well, I just checked and we still don't have any news
[01:32:43.360 --> 01:32:45.280]   about what happened in that tumultuous board meeting
[01:32:45.280 --> 01:32:47.120]   at Uber, so I'm gonna leave that to the listener
[01:32:47.120 --> 01:32:49.440]   to do some homework, just check up and see how that went.
[01:32:49.440 --> 01:32:51.360]   And maybe they'll talk about it next week on Twitch,
[01:32:51.360 --> 01:32:55.200]   but I sense now that I need to,
[01:32:55.200 --> 01:32:57.240]   Leo's comment, but not quite yet,
[01:32:57.240 --> 01:32:59.760]   first, I think we need to take a look back
[01:32:59.760 --> 01:33:01.720]   on while Uber was having a bad week,
[01:33:01.720 --> 01:33:03.800]   the week that was here at Twitch.
[01:33:03.800 --> 01:33:05.960]   - Previously on Twitch.
[01:33:05.960 --> 01:33:09.280]   - Now you can play with a fidget spinner on your phone
[01:33:09.280 --> 01:33:13.000]   or on the internet, there we go, spins.
[01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.800]   - This is us when we get a digital fidget spinner.
[01:33:15.800 --> 01:33:17.960]   - I thought yours wasn't spinning it wrong.
[01:33:17.960 --> 01:33:18.800]   - You're doing it wrong.
[01:33:18.800 --> 01:33:21.400]   - No, I'm doing it right.
[01:33:21.400 --> 01:33:23.160]   - You're not doing it right.
[01:33:23.160 --> 01:33:24.040]   (record scratching)
[01:33:24.040 --> 01:33:25.200]   - Security now.
[01:33:25.200 --> 01:33:29.160]   - The UK's Trident Submarine Fleet is vulnerable to,
[01:33:29.160 --> 01:33:33.520]   as the Guardian quoted, a catastrophic cyber attack.
[01:33:33.520 --> 01:33:38.520]   All the various support systems are running Windows XP.
[01:33:38.520 --> 01:33:41.360]   - We can have just skipped all of that and just say,
[01:33:41.360 --> 01:33:43.680]   here's the gobs backing part.
[01:33:43.680 --> 01:33:46.640]   There's a bunch of nukes run by Windows XP.
[01:33:46.640 --> 01:33:47.960]   - Tech news today.
[01:33:47.960 --> 01:33:51.000]   - The idea of buying likes or followers isn't new,
[01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:54.480]   but Louise Mitzakis from Motherboard recently came upon
[01:33:54.480 --> 01:33:57.400]   a photo of a vending machine in a mall
[01:33:57.400 --> 01:34:01.600]   that will sell you 100 likes for a mere 50 Russian rubles.
[01:34:01.600 --> 01:34:04.760]   - All the likes and all the followers come from bot accounts.
[01:34:04.760 --> 01:34:07.160]   If yours like, there's some sort of automated marketing
[01:34:07.160 --> 01:34:08.920]   that happens when you use this machine,
[01:34:08.920 --> 01:34:10.920]   I definitely would not recommend anybody
[01:34:10.920 --> 01:34:13.320]   and you maybe make a better post.
[01:34:13.320 --> 01:34:15.880]   - I don't know, it kind of sounds like a value add to me.
[01:34:15.880 --> 01:34:17.440]   (laughing)
[01:34:17.440 --> 01:34:19.600]   - You think it's some extra spam on the backend?
[01:34:19.600 --> 01:34:20.960]   Everybody wins.
[01:34:20.960 --> 01:34:23.680]   - Twitch, tech just like you like it.
[01:34:24.680 --> 01:34:26.000]   - Yeah, see?
[01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.200]   See, we're all doing it wrong, aren't we?
[01:34:28.200 --> 01:34:30.200]   - Uh huh.
[01:34:30.200 --> 01:34:32.200]   - You got one spin.
[01:34:32.200 --> 01:34:34.040]   - What's wrong with this stupid?
[01:34:34.040 --> 01:34:35.400]   (laughing)
[01:34:35.400 --> 01:34:37.000]   - We're an adult using tech.
[01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:37.920]   - Fidget spinners.
[01:34:37.920 --> 01:34:39.000]   - It's been a terrible 20 years ago.
[01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000]   - Touch screen fidget spinner.
[01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:42.680]   That is what the, thank you internet,
[01:34:42.680 --> 01:34:46.320]   thank you computer industry for giving us virtual fidget spinners.
[01:34:46.320 --> 01:34:49.200]   There is of course a lot coming up in the next week
[01:34:49.200 --> 01:34:51.680]   as we record in addition to that really dramatic
[01:34:51.680 --> 01:34:53.680]   Uber board meeting that's apparently going on.
[01:34:53.680 --> 01:34:56.960]   There is E3 news already, Microsoft's made some announcements.
[01:34:56.960 --> 01:34:57.800]   There's more to come.
[01:34:57.800 --> 01:35:00.280]   I'm gonna predict that that may be among the things
[01:35:00.280 --> 01:35:02.440]   to look for in the week ahead.
[01:35:02.440 --> 01:35:05.480]   - This week, most skews of the new Surface Pro
[01:35:05.480 --> 01:35:08.080]   will ship along with the Surface laptop.
[01:35:08.080 --> 01:35:10.360]   The Surface Pro starts at $800
[01:35:10.360 --> 01:35:13.000]   and goes as high as $2,700.
[01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:16.640]   And keep in mind, that does not include any accessories.
[01:35:16.640 --> 01:35:19.280]   The new Surface Pro looks a lot like the old Surface Pro,
[01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:20.560]   but according to Microsoft,
[01:35:20.560 --> 01:35:23.880]   there are about 800 new parts inside.
[01:35:23.880 --> 01:35:26.120]   Sony has some new hardware coming out this week.
[01:35:26.120 --> 01:35:29.480]   The XZ Premium was announced back in February
[01:35:29.480 --> 01:35:30.880]   at Mobile World Congress,
[01:35:30.880 --> 01:35:34.320]   but it only becomes available for pre-order on June 12th.
[01:35:34.320 --> 01:35:36.160]   And you'll have to wait until June 19th
[01:35:36.160 --> 01:35:37.760]   for the unlocked version.
[01:35:37.760 --> 01:35:40.960]   The XZ Premium has a 5.5 inch 4K screen
[01:35:40.960 --> 01:35:43.760]   and a camera that captures slow motion 720p
[01:35:43.760 --> 01:35:46.160]   and 960 FPS video.
[01:35:46.160 --> 01:35:49.680]   Like the new Surface Pro, the XZ Premium also starts
[01:35:49.680 --> 01:35:50.920]   at $800.
[01:35:50.920 --> 01:35:53.040]   And for all you gamers out there,
[01:35:53.040 --> 01:35:57.120]   this week is the Electronic Entertainment Expo or E3,
[01:35:57.120 --> 01:35:58.880]   which already started on Saturday.
[01:35:58.880 --> 01:36:02.320]   We expect to see new Star Wars games from EA
[01:36:02.320 --> 01:36:05.200]   and a new Wolfenstein game from Bethesda.
[01:36:05.200 --> 01:36:08.120]   And of course, the new console from Microsoft,
[01:36:08.120 --> 01:36:10.680]   code named Project Scorpio.
[01:36:10.680 --> 01:36:14.040]   We might even see a price drop from PlayStation
[01:36:14.040 --> 01:36:16.000]   to compete with Microsoft's offering.
[01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:19.000]   That is just a few of the stories we'll be following
[01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:19.840]   this week.
[01:36:19.840 --> 01:36:22.520]   Jason Howell and I are here covering the tech news
[01:36:22.520 --> 01:36:25.720]   every day Monday through Friday at 4PM Pacific.
[01:36:25.720 --> 01:36:27.280]   Back to you.
[01:36:27.280 --> 01:36:31.000]   - It's the Xbox One X, by the way, apparently Scorpio.
[01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:32.000]   But there'll be much more on that.
[01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:35.200]   I'm glad I was a little bit like what Harry and Micah
[01:36:35.200 --> 01:36:37.760]   felt about the iPad announcements in iOS 11
[01:36:37.760 --> 01:36:39.520]   that I thought Megan was never gonna get to E3
[01:36:39.520 --> 01:36:41.800]   and my prediction was gonna be totally wrong.
[01:36:41.800 --> 01:36:45.240]   At the very end, oh, it's so dramatic.
[01:36:45.240 --> 01:36:47.520]   Also, I will say, 'cause this is a game that I just played
[01:36:47.520 --> 01:36:50.320]   and I love another E3 announcement that happened,
[01:36:50.320 --> 01:36:52.520]   is that Life is Strange, which is a really awesome game
[01:36:52.520 --> 01:36:55.080]   that you should play, is getting a three episode prequel.
[01:36:55.080 --> 01:36:56.120]   I'm very happy about that.
[01:36:56.120 --> 01:36:57.240]   Look at me.
[01:36:57.240 --> 01:36:58.840]   I have opinions about games.
[01:36:58.840 --> 01:37:02.600]   It can happen every so often it happens.
[01:37:02.600 --> 01:37:05.800]   Now, again, I do sense that Leo perhaps
[01:37:05.800 --> 01:37:07.680]   has one more thing to tell us about.
[01:37:07.680 --> 01:37:10.320]   - Our show today brought to you by this,
[01:37:10.320 --> 01:37:12.160]   the, this.
[01:37:12.160 --> 01:37:15.360]   I took this off my front door, no, I didn't.
[01:37:15.360 --> 01:37:18.760]   The Ring Video Doorbell Ring's mission
[01:37:18.760 --> 01:37:20.600]   is to make neighborhoods safer.
[01:37:20.600 --> 01:37:22.320]   Actually, they did a really interesting experiment
[01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:24.120]   with the police department in the Southern California
[01:37:24.120 --> 01:37:27.280]   small town and it was a very simple experiment
[01:37:27.280 --> 01:37:28.120]   but it really worked.
[01:37:28.120 --> 01:37:30.640]   They put Ring Video Doorbells on one home in 10,
[01:37:30.640 --> 01:37:33.120]   not every home, one home in 10.
[01:37:33.120 --> 01:37:34.680]   But the thing about the Ring is it makes your whole
[01:37:34.680 --> 01:37:36.760]   neighborhood safer.
[01:37:36.760 --> 01:37:38.800]   The Ring Video Doorbell, it's got a camera on it,
[01:37:38.800 --> 01:37:41.760]   it's got a microphone, it's got a speaker.
[01:37:41.760 --> 01:37:43.640]   I'll tell you why that's important in a second.
[01:37:43.640 --> 01:37:45.840]   It also has motion detection.
[01:37:45.840 --> 01:37:47.960]   Bad guys know there's a neighborhood
[01:37:47.960 --> 01:37:50.200]   that's full of Ring Doorbells.
[01:37:50.200 --> 01:37:51.960]   They're not going anywhere near it.
[01:37:51.960 --> 01:37:53.120]   Put yourself in the bad guy's shoes.
[01:37:53.120 --> 01:37:54.000]   You know, it's middle of the day.
[01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:55.880]   That's actually when most homes get robbed,
[01:37:55.880 --> 01:37:57.360]   not at night, but in the middle of the day,
[01:37:57.360 --> 01:37:58.920]   while you're at work, right?
[01:37:58.920 --> 01:38:00.800]   So the bad guy first makes sure you're at work,
[01:38:00.800 --> 01:38:03.240]   he comes up and rings the doorbell.
[01:38:03.240 --> 01:38:05.040]   Well, even though you're at work,
[01:38:05.040 --> 01:38:08.840]   you can answer your doorbell 'cause every time somebody
[01:38:08.840 --> 01:38:10.680]   comes up, even if they don't ring the doorbell,
[01:38:10.680 --> 01:38:12.600]   just comes up my stoop.
[01:38:12.600 --> 01:38:14.480]   I get a little ding, a little bring,
[01:38:14.480 --> 01:38:16.000]   sounds like wind chimes.
[01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:17.840]   On my phone, you've probably heard it
[01:38:17.840 --> 01:38:19.520]   'cause it happens a lot, I forget to mute my phone,
[01:38:19.520 --> 01:38:20.920]   it happens on the show.
[01:38:20.920 --> 01:38:23.960]   Bring, and I can look who's at my door.
[01:38:23.960 --> 01:38:24.920]   When they ring the doorbell goes,
[01:38:24.920 --> 01:38:25.840]   ♪ Bong, bong, bong ♪
[01:38:25.840 --> 01:38:27.200]   on my phone.
[01:38:27.200 --> 01:38:28.440]   And here's the great part.
[01:38:28.440 --> 01:38:29.840]   I go, yeah, what is it?
[01:38:29.840 --> 01:38:33.160]   I can see them and I can talk to them.
[01:38:33.160 --> 01:38:34.640]   And they don't know I'm not inside.
[01:38:34.640 --> 01:38:36.400]   Now if it's a bad guy, they go,
[01:38:36.400 --> 01:38:38.560]   oh, I'm sorry, wrong house.
[01:38:38.560 --> 01:38:40.000]   And they run away.
[01:38:41.400 --> 01:38:42.240]   It's awesome.
[01:38:42.240 --> 01:38:44.840]   And if it's the UPS guy, you can say,
[01:38:44.840 --> 01:38:47.160]   oh, I'm in the bathtub, could you just leave it there
[01:38:47.160 --> 01:38:49.160]   and I'll sign for it tomorrow?
[01:38:49.160 --> 01:38:50.280]   It works.
[01:38:50.280 --> 01:38:51.800]   And when there's a package in your doorstep,
[01:38:51.800 --> 01:38:53.080]   you can check it anytime you want.
[01:38:53.080 --> 01:38:56.080]   Ring video doorbell.
[01:38:56.080 --> 01:38:58.240]   They have a new product, I love the Floodlight Cam.
[01:38:58.240 --> 01:39:00.040]   I've ordered a couple of these, it's a MotionAct.
[01:39:00.040 --> 01:39:02.120]   It's just basically a Ring video doorbell
[01:39:02.120 --> 01:39:05.280]   with a big floodlight on it and no doorbell.
[01:39:05.280 --> 01:39:08.600]   So it's a MotionActivated camera with a floodlight,
[01:39:08.600 --> 01:39:11.120]   just like the ring connects to your phone.
[01:39:11.120 --> 01:39:14.600]   You've got high def video, you've got two-way audio.
[01:39:14.600 --> 01:39:16.760]   You can see when some, we have a neighbor
[01:39:16.760 --> 01:39:19.080]   who likes to come on our property.
[01:39:19.080 --> 01:39:21.240]   And I'm gonna put it right up there.
[01:39:21.240 --> 01:39:22.760]   First of all, the light's gonna come on.
[01:39:22.760 --> 01:39:23.960]   He's gonna know I'm watching.
[01:39:23.960 --> 01:39:26.920]   And then I swear to God, I'm gonna go,
[01:39:26.920 --> 01:39:30.120]   hey, Bob, get out of here.
[01:39:30.120 --> 01:39:31.240]   I see you.
[01:39:31.240 --> 01:39:32.080]   I can't wait.
[01:39:32.080 --> 01:39:37.240]   Whether you're home or away, the Ring Floodlight Cam
[01:39:37.240 --> 01:39:38.880]   helps you keep an eye on your home.
[01:39:38.880 --> 01:39:40.560]   Ring Floodlight Cam's offer the ultimate
[01:39:40.560 --> 01:39:43.320]   home security, high visibility floodlights,
[01:39:43.320 --> 01:39:45.120]   a powerful HD camera.
[01:39:45.120 --> 01:39:49.520]   It was named the Wall Street Journal's best of CES for 2017.
[01:39:49.520 --> 01:39:51.800]   Now, we've got some Ring of Security kits
[01:39:51.800 --> 01:39:53.200]   and some very good deals for you.
[01:39:53.200 --> 01:39:55.080]   When you go to ring.com/twit,
[01:39:55.080 --> 01:39:57.200]   the kit includes a Ring video doorbell
[01:39:57.200 --> 01:40:00.520]   and your choice of either one, two, or three floodlight cams.
[01:40:00.520 --> 01:40:03.640]   So your whole house can be lit up,
[01:40:03.640 --> 01:40:05.600]   connect your Ring video doorbell with your favorite
[01:40:05.600 --> 01:40:07.680]   smart locks and hubs for added convenience
[01:40:07.680 --> 01:40:09.120]   and monitoring and security.
[01:40:09.120 --> 01:40:10.440]   With Ring, you're always home.
[01:40:10.440 --> 01:40:13.840]   Save up to 150 bucks of a Ring of Security kit.
[01:40:13.840 --> 01:40:18.840]   Go to ring.com/twit, that's Ring.com/twit.
[01:40:18.840 --> 01:40:21.480]   And we thank Ring for their support.
[01:40:21.480 --> 01:40:26.000]   Now, let's continue with Twit.
[01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:27.080]   Jason.
[01:40:27.080 --> 01:40:28.520]   - Thank you, Leo.
[01:40:28.520 --> 01:40:30.760]   I sense that Leo's presence may have left us,
[01:40:30.760 --> 01:40:34.160]   but I'm sure he'll be back tomorrow with more.
[01:40:34.160 --> 01:40:37.440]   Again, I have, I promised no more Apple stuff.
[01:40:37.440 --> 01:40:40.000]   Instead, though, I wanna tell you,
[01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:43.840]   'cause I know you wanna know about Taylor Swift, everybody.
[01:40:43.840 --> 01:40:46.800]   You see, Taylor Swift was in the news this week
[01:40:46.800 --> 01:40:51.800]   because the bitter feud between Taylor Swift and Spotify
[01:40:51.800 --> 01:40:55.200]   ended this week with her music returning to Spotify
[01:40:55.200 --> 01:40:56.920]   and pretty much every other streaming service
[01:40:56.920 --> 01:40:59.120]   that it was not already on.
[01:40:59.120 --> 01:41:00.760]   The Verge had a really great article
[01:41:00.760 --> 01:41:03.480]   about the history of Taylor Swift's statements
[01:41:03.480 --> 01:41:06.240]   about her opinions about streaming.
[01:41:06.240 --> 01:41:08.280]   There have been many over the years.
[01:41:08.280 --> 01:41:11.880]   Now, I feel, again, like maybe Micah Sargent
[01:41:11.880 --> 01:41:14.240]   has some opinions about this,
[01:41:14.240 --> 01:41:15.840]   breaking story involving Taylor Swift.
[01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:17.520]   Micah, what do you think?
[01:41:17.520 --> 01:41:20.600]   - You know, I might disappoint.
[01:41:20.600 --> 01:41:21.440]   - No, never.
[01:41:21.440 --> 01:41:23.680]   - I'm sorry, thank you.
[01:41:23.680 --> 01:41:25.840]   Taylor Swift's music's fine.
[01:41:25.840 --> 01:41:27.360]   I'm sorry, Christina Warren.
[01:41:27.360 --> 01:41:29.760]   I'm sorry everybody who's a Taylor Swift fan.
[01:41:29.760 --> 01:41:31.680]   - Fan praise, fan praise.
[01:41:31.680 --> 01:41:33.240]   - I'm not a huge Taylor Swift fan,
[01:41:33.240 --> 01:41:35.680]   so this didn't really matter all that much
[01:41:35.680 --> 01:41:37.200]   to me that her music was suddenly available
[01:41:37.200 --> 01:41:38.680]   across all the platforms.
[01:41:38.680 --> 01:41:41.320]   But what I will say is that, you know,
[01:41:41.320 --> 01:41:43.840]   when Taylor Swift originally put out that message
[01:41:43.840 --> 01:41:47.000]   about Spotify and streaming music services in general
[01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:51.080]   and about devaluing creation,
[01:41:51.080 --> 01:41:52.600]   that kind of hit me in the fields
[01:41:52.600 --> 01:41:56.360]   because there are, you know, it's not just music.
[01:41:56.360 --> 01:41:58.920]   There are a lot of different areas,
[01:41:58.920 --> 01:42:03.800]   like graphic designers and artists and architects
[01:42:03.800 --> 01:42:07.480]   and people who don't make physical products
[01:42:07.480 --> 01:42:10.440]   or work to make physical things or sell physical things
[01:42:10.440 --> 01:42:12.000]   where a lot of times, you know,
[01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.400]   we see devaluation happen there.
[01:42:14.400 --> 01:42:17.200]   And graphic designers often joke about spec work,
[01:42:17.200 --> 01:42:18.760]   but it's a very real thing.
[01:42:18.760 --> 01:42:22.440]   And it's, you know, I thought there was something to it.
[01:42:22.440 --> 01:42:25.120]   Now, this coming from a very hypocritical human being
[01:42:25.120 --> 01:42:28.200]   who also enjoys streaming music services,
[01:42:28.200 --> 01:42:30.880]   but at the same time, I got where she was coming from
[01:42:30.880 --> 01:42:31.720]   with that.
[01:42:31.720 --> 01:42:33.720]   And if it was her decision to leave her music off
[01:42:33.720 --> 01:42:36.320]   because she felt like a company was devaluing her
[01:42:36.320 --> 01:42:38.400]   as a person and her as an artist
[01:42:38.400 --> 01:42:41.040]   and the stuff that she was making, I got that.
[01:42:41.040 --> 01:42:43.280]   I get it now on this side where we're talking about
[01:42:43.280 --> 01:42:46.440]   how it's good for everybody because it's good for consumers
[01:42:46.440 --> 01:42:49.360]   who are kind of choosing between streaming music services.
[01:42:49.360 --> 01:42:50.200]   That's great.
[01:42:50.200 --> 01:42:52.240]   And in fact, I think I had to go update an article
[01:42:52.240 --> 01:42:53.800]   that I wrote about streaming music services
[01:42:53.800 --> 01:42:56.560]   because Taylor Swift was one of the items
[01:42:56.560 --> 01:42:58.480]   that I had talked about on there.
[01:42:58.480 --> 01:42:59.440]   So yeah, good.
[01:42:59.440 --> 01:43:01.240]   People who like Taylor Swift can not listen to her
[01:43:01.240 --> 01:43:02.760]   across those different platforms.
[01:43:02.760 --> 01:43:04.040]   That's fantastic.
[01:43:04.040 --> 01:43:06.080]   Apparently, she doesn't feel the same way she once did
[01:43:06.080 --> 01:43:08.400]   about people devaluing her works.
[01:43:08.400 --> 01:43:10.840]   But we'll leave that to come out in Twitter
[01:43:10.840 --> 01:43:12.680]   over the next week or so.
[01:43:12.680 --> 01:43:14.520]   - Yeah, I do wonder what motivated this.
[01:43:14.520 --> 01:43:18.760]   If it was a particular feeling about the role of music
[01:43:18.760 --> 01:43:20.120]   services and how they pay artists,
[01:43:20.120 --> 01:43:21.640]   because that was her famously with Apple
[01:43:21.640 --> 01:43:23.200]   that she was complaining about Apple Music.
[01:43:23.200 --> 01:43:25.440]   And Apple made nice with Taylor
[01:43:25.440 --> 01:43:27.600]   and she put her music on Apple Music.
[01:43:27.600 --> 01:43:29.240]   So did that happen with Spotify
[01:43:29.240 --> 01:43:30.880]   or did she just decide it was time?
[01:43:30.880 --> 01:43:31.720]   I don't know.
[01:43:32.720 --> 01:43:35.400]   I've been informed by the way by important sources,
[01:43:35.400 --> 01:43:39.240]   namely my daughter, that there is an ongoing feud
[01:43:39.240 --> 01:43:41.960]   of some sort between Taylor Swift and Katy Perry.
[01:43:41.960 --> 01:43:45.680]   Katy Perry's new album came out this week.
[01:43:45.680 --> 01:43:47.240]   Actually, I believe the same day
[01:43:47.240 --> 01:43:49.920]   that Taylor Swift's albums reach streaming services,
[01:43:49.920 --> 01:43:52.680]   leading conspiracy theorists,
[01:43:52.680 --> 01:43:55.280]   the internet's finest pop music conspiracy theorists
[01:43:55.280 --> 01:43:58.200]   to wonder if perhaps this was Taylor's way
[01:43:58.200 --> 01:44:01.320]   of taking some of the spotlight off of Katy Perry.
[01:44:01.320 --> 01:44:04.440]   However, Katy Perry, I will say my Amazon Echo,
[01:44:04.440 --> 01:44:07.080]   told me this week that I could talk to Katy Perry
[01:44:07.080 --> 01:44:08.440]   and she would tell me about all the songs
[01:44:08.440 --> 01:44:09.280]   on her new album.
[01:44:09.280 --> 01:44:11.160]   So the battle is joined.
[01:44:11.160 --> 01:44:13.160]   The battle is being fought across cyberspace now.
[01:44:13.160 --> 01:44:15.240]   - She's live streamed her weekend Katy Perry.
[01:44:15.240 --> 01:44:16.080]   - She did.
[01:44:16.080 --> 01:44:20.120]   - Yeah, she's all in on this new distribution technology.
[01:44:20.120 --> 01:44:22.200]   - And whether these feuds are real or silly,
[01:44:22.200 --> 01:44:25.280]   I mean, somebody told me that Taylor Swift's song,
[01:44:25.280 --> 01:44:26.480]   "Bad Blood" is about Katy Perry.
[01:44:26.480 --> 01:44:27.320]   I don't know.
[01:44:27.320 --> 01:44:28.360]   I don't know anything about it.
[01:44:28.360 --> 01:44:31.080]   But it is fascinating to see modern 21st century
[01:44:31.080 --> 01:44:32.160]   pop music marketing, right?
[01:44:32.160 --> 01:44:35.240]   The idea that Katy Perry is in my Amazon Echo this week
[01:44:35.240 --> 01:44:36.800]   and she's live streaming herself.
[01:44:36.800 --> 01:44:39.760]   And then on the other side, Taylor Swift is making news
[01:44:39.760 --> 01:44:41.280]   about her back catalog,
[01:44:41.280 --> 01:44:43.560]   nothing new to release just a back catalog.
[01:44:43.560 --> 01:44:44.880]   This is the world we live in.
[01:44:44.880 --> 01:44:46.360]   - Katy has embraced YouTube,
[01:44:46.360 --> 01:44:49.680]   which is a service a lot of musicians can't stand.
[01:44:49.680 --> 01:44:52.880]   They went to YouTube's new fronts a couple of months ago
[01:44:52.880 --> 01:44:54.800]   and she was there.
[01:44:54.800 --> 01:44:58.440]   She gave us all a concert and she's doing live streaming
[01:44:58.440 --> 01:45:01.280]   to promote her album on YouTube.
[01:45:01.280 --> 01:45:03.480]   - You sound like you could not have been more excited
[01:45:03.480 --> 01:45:05.240]   to see Katy Perry and the concert.
[01:45:05.240 --> 01:45:06.680]   - Oh my gosh, I'm on Team Katy
[01:45:06.680 --> 01:45:07.920]   just 'cause I've seen her in person
[01:45:07.920 --> 01:45:10.480]   and I don't know Taylor Swift from Adam at this point.
[01:45:10.480 --> 01:45:11.320]   - All right.
[01:45:11.320 --> 01:45:12.320]   - She's got a blank space video.
[01:45:12.320 --> 01:45:13.160]   - I'm convinced.
[01:45:13.160 --> 01:45:14.000]   - Maybe she'll write your name.
[01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:14.840]   - Oh yes, Lisa.
[01:45:14.840 --> 01:45:15.680]   - Yeah, oh yes.
[01:45:15.680 --> 01:45:17.360]   - The feud extends to Harry McCracken now.
[01:45:17.360 --> 01:45:19.280]   Watch out, Taylor Swift.
[01:45:19.280 --> 01:45:22.480]   - I'm convinced that all of these feuds are not real,
[01:45:22.480 --> 01:45:24.200]   but instead are marketing things.
[01:45:24.200 --> 01:45:27.920]   There was a feud between Nicki Minaj and Rimee Ma.
[01:45:27.920 --> 01:45:28.960]   I'm sorry everybody.
[01:45:28.960 --> 01:45:29.840]   Rimee Ma.
[01:45:29.840 --> 01:45:31.240]   - And Rimee Ma was this.
[01:45:31.240 --> 01:45:34.440]   - Basically each of them writing songs back and forth
[01:45:34.440 --> 01:45:37.680]   to each other, just absolutely decimating the other person.
[01:45:37.680 --> 01:45:41.880]   There was Taylor Swift and Kanye West/Kim Kardashian,
[01:45:41.880 --> 01:45:43.920]   which was a hilarious thing because it resulted
[01:45:43.920 --> 01:45:46.200]   in one of the most funny phrases
[01:45:46.200 --> 01:45:48.560]   that I actually save in my photos library
[01:45:48.560 --> 01:45:52.080]   so that I can use it anytime I ever want to be excluded
[01:45:52.080 --> 01:45:56.360]   from a narrative where she said and I quote,
[01:45:56.360 --> 01:45:58.680]   "I would very much like to be excluded from this narrative,
[01:45:58.680 --> 01:46:01.040]   "Kama, one that I have never asked to be a part of,
[01:46:01.040 --> 01:46:03.600]   "Kama since 2009."
[01:46:03.600 --> 01:46:05.520]   And then there was the,
[01:46:05.520 --> 01:46:09.240]   absolutely the whole album eliminated by Beyonce
[01:46:09.240 --> 01:46:12.800]   was supposed to be about her and her husband, JZ,
[01:46:12.800 --> 01:46:15.640]   and some infidelity in the relationship.
[01:46:15.640 --> 01:46:18.440]   And I'm not even 100% sure that that's true
[01:46:18.440 --> 01:46:21.040]   and it could have just been another bit of marketing.
[01:46:21.040 --> 01:46:23.360]   So I like to believe that all of these are fake
[01:46:23.360 --> 01:46:25.560]   and that Taylor Swift and Katy Perry
[01:46:25.560 --> 01:46:27.680]   just signed some contracts from there that was like,
[01:46:27.680 --> 01:46:29.000]   yes, for the next two years,
[01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.920]   we can't be seen together in person
[01:46:31.920 --> 01:46:35.160]   and we have to pretend to fight and write songs about each other
[01:46:35.160 --> 01:46:37.800]   and we're both going to profit so much from this.
[01:46:37.800 --> 01:46:40.280]   So, yeah, none of it's real, it's all fake.
[01:46:40.280 --> 01:46:43.160]   - And it all happens on social media,
[01:46:43.160 --> 01:46:45.960]   which is why I actually wanted to bring it up on Twitch.
[01:46:45.960 --> 01:46:47.160]   This isn't just about music streaming,
[01:46:47.160 --> 01:46:48.840]   it's about using social media as marketing.
[01:46:48.840 --> 01:46:49.840]   How do you do it?
[01:46:49.840 --> 01:46:53.040]   They can't back any old days, they'd go on like a TV show,
[01:46:53.040 --> 01:46:56.520]   they'd go on American Bandstand or the Ed Sullivan Show
[01:46:56.520 --> 01:46:57.360]   or you name it.
[01:46:57.360 --> 01:46:58.360]   - The World Wrestling Entertainment,
[01:46:58.360 --> 01:46:59.440]   which is what this is like,
[01:46:59.440 --> 01:47:01.360]   playing with the K-Fay stuff.
[01:47:01.360 --> 01:47:02.880]   - It is a little bit of John Crawford and Betty Davis,
[01:47:02.880 --> 01:47:04.280]   except they didn't have social media.
[01:47:04.280 --> 01:47:07.520]   - Yeah, imagine that Instagram stream.
[01:47:07.520 --> 01:47:10.520]   Anyway, I think what I'm saying is,
[01:47:10.520 --> 01:47:12.280]   it wasn't all about Apple today.
[01:47:12.280 --> 01:47:14.520]   It was also about Taylor Swift and Uber
[01:47:14.520 --> 01:47:16.640]   and a little bit of Amazon and Walmart.
[01:47:16.640 --> 01:47:19.960]   And we still haven't decided who the snake is
[01:47:19.960 --> 01:47:22.760]   and who the crocodile is, but we'll work that out.
[01:47:22.760 --> 01:47:24.480]   - Or if it's a crocodile or an alligator,
[01:47:24.480 --> 01:47:27.320]   I think we've got some lots of herpetology things going on.
[01:47:27.320 --> 01:47:29.680]   Study of reptiles, I would like to thank my guests
[01:47:29.680 --> 01:47:32.240]   for being here for all of it, Lisa Schmeiser.
[01:47:32.240 --> 01:47:34.800]   People can find you on Twitter at elchmeiser.
[01:47:34.800 --> 01:47:35.640]   - Yes.
[01:47:35.640 --> 01:47:37.360]   - And you're also at the wind super site.
[01:47:37.360 --> 01:47:38.760]   - Windsupersight.com.
[01:47:38.760 --> 01:47:40.280]   - And you run that the whole show over there.
[01:47:40.280 --> 01:47:41.120]   - I run the show over there.
[01:47:41.120 --> 01:47:41.960]   - So it's so great to have you here.
[01:47:41.960 --> 01:47:42.800]   Thank you.
[01:47:42.800 --> 01:47:45.920]   Harry McCracken, a fast company now.
[01:47:45.920 --> 01:47:46.800]   Great to have you here.
[01:47:46.800 --> 01:47:47.960]   What are you working on?
[01:47:47.960 --> 01:47:50.560]   I heard you're working on something, something good.
[01:47:50.560 --> 01:47:51.400]   - And we're going on something good,
[01:47:51.400 --> 01:47:53.080]   which we decided to hold off a little bit on.
[01:47:53.080 --> 01:47:55.200]   So I'm not talking about it at the moment.
[01:47:55.200 --> 01:47:56.360]   It won't be too long.
[01:47:56.360 --> 01:47:58.240]   And the nice thing about Fast Company
[01:47:58.240 --> 01:47:59.760]   is we do a lot of slow-cooked stuff.
[01:47:59.760 --> 01:48:02.520]   So I'm also working on cool stuff you won't see for months.
[01:48:02.520 --> 01:48:04.120]   It should be neat when it comes out.
[01:48:04.120 --> 01:48:05.520]   And I hope I'll be back to talk about it.
[01:48:05.520 --> 01:48:07.920]   - And do you still have the personalized license plate?
[01:48:07.920 --> 01:48:09.800]   - No, actually, when I bought a new car,
[01:48:09.800 --> 01:48:11.760]   I gave up my PC world license plate.
[01:48:11.760 --> 01:48:12.600]   - Oh.
[01:48:12.600 --> 01:48:13.640]   I could always tell when you were at an event
[01:48:13.640 --> 01:48:14.480]   that I was going to,
[01:48:14.480 --> 01:48:15.840]   'cause I could see your car in the parking lot,
[01:48:15.840 --> 01:48:17.160]   'cause I knew your license plate was--
[01:48:17.160 --> 01:48:19.320]   - I once cut off Jim Lauterback,
[01:48:19.320 --> 01:48:21.480]   who was the editor of PC Magazine.
[01:48:21.480 --> 01:48:23.000]   We live near each other.
[01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:24.840]   I cut off on 288, and he knew it was me,
[01:48:24.840 --> 01:48:26.760]   'cause he saw my PC world plate.
[01:48:26.760 --> 01:48:29.440]   And I didn't do it on purpose, but how appropriate.
[01:48:29.440 --> 01:48:30.760]   - How appropriate, indeed.
[01:48:30.760 --> 01:48:32.720]   And Mike, Asargent, you are at iMore.
[01:48:32.720 --> 01:48:35.760]   You also host a bunch of podcasts, real AFAs.
[01:48:35.760 --> 01:48:38.320]   - Yeah, and if you're looking for Be Online,
[01:48:38.320 --> 01:48:41.960]   you can find me at www.chihuahua.coffee.
[01:48:41.960 --> 01:48:43.000]   - No, that's not a joke.
[01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.760]   - It really works so great to have you here.
[01:48:45.760 --> 01:48:46.920]   Thank you for being on.
[01:48:48.080 --> 01:48:49.160]   - Oh, yeah, of course.
[01:48:49.160 --> 01:48:50.880]   - And thanks to everybody out there.
[01:48:50.880 --> 01:48:52.920]   I know, no Leo, it's sad.
[01:48:52.920 --> 01:48:55.920]   I appreciate, thank you to Leo for letting me sit in for him
[01:48:55.920 --> 01:48:57.840]   and for picking a week where we could talk about
[01:48:57.840 --> 01:49:00.120]   some Apple stuff, which makes me happy,
[01:49:00.120 --> 01:49:01.160]   along with some other stuff.
[01:49:01.160 --> 01:49:02.720]   And Taylor Swift, okay, I'll admit it.
[01:49:02.720 --> 01:49:04.160]   Talking about Taylor Swift and Katy Perry,
[01:49:04.160 --> 01:49:05.320]   kind of made me happy.
[01:49:05.320 --> 01:49:07.920]   Anyway, that's it for this week.
[01:49:07.920 --> 01:49:09.800]   Twit will be back next week.
[01:49:09.800 --> 01:49:13.160]   And until then, I say, goodbye.
[01:49:13.160 --> 01:49:16.960]   Another Twit is in whatever container we put it in.
[01:49:16.960 --> 01:49:19.540]   (upbeat music)

[01:49:21.380 --> 01:49:23.220]   ♪ Do the Twit, baby ♪
