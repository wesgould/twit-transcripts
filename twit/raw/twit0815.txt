[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.400]   It's time for Twit this week in Tech.
[00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:02.840]   Oh, it's going to be a wild one.
[00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:06.840]   I always know it will be when Georgia Zhao joins Owen, JJ Stone,
[00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.920]   and the return of Roberto Baldwin from Car & Driver.
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.360]   There is a lot to talk about.
[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.960]   We go crazy.
[00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.960]   Among other things, the Twitter hacker, he's going to jail.
[00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.760]   That Apple event coming up this Tuesday turns out
[00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:20.760]   it was a sting all along.
[00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.200]   And the ugliest grill you've ever seen.
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.040]   It's all coming up next on Twit.

[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.880]   It's time for Twit.
[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.480]   This week at Tech, the show where we cover the week's tech news.
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.760]   We're already an hour into the show.
[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.480]   Where have you been?
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.360]   We're having such a good time because it's
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.400]   been three and a half years since we've seen this cat.
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.400]   And I'm so thrilled to have Roberto Baldwin back on.
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.800]   We're in a half years?
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:37.920]   Yes.
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.600]   Since July 2017.
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:40.960]   I don't understand it.
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:41.720]   I don't understand that.
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.800]   So since last we talked, Roberto, where were you working
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.080]   when you used to be on?
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.280]   Was it in gadget?
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.280]   I was in gadget.
[00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.000]   And I was covering automotive and musical instruments.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.800]   So I did a lot of synths and drum machines and keyboards.
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.520]   And the occasional guitar.
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.840]   Before that, you were at TMZ.
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.480]   And way before that-- no, not late.
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.960]   There's like--
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.360]   Oh, I want to hear all the best.
[00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.160]   I know.
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.520]   I want all the best sweat.
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:08.040]   I know.
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.000]   He knows Harvey.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.360]   He knows he's worked with Harvey.
[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.560]   Oh, I want to know.
[00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.040]   I want to know the stories.
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.480]   This should be on the show.
[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.360]   So TMZ--
[00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.000]   That's TMZ.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   Of course.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.960]   --of other places.
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.440]   TMZ.
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.000]   Anyway, he's done other things.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   After a gadget, what did you do?
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.120]   I went to car and driver.
[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.120]   Oh, nice.
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.480]   --of the automotive world.
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:27.160]   So I went there.
[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.360]   I was a car and driver for about 14 months.
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.160]   And just last Wednesday?
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.960]   Yeah, I decided to--
[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.800]   well, I decided a month or so ago.
[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.280]   But last Wednesday was my last day at car and driver.
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.320]   What?
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:42.440]   I know.
[00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:43.640]   Who leaves car and driver?
[00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:44.960]   What idiot does that?
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.400]   This guy.
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.680]   Because I wanted to do a little bit more tech, cover
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.560]   automotive in a different way, and also do a lot more videos.
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:54.560]   That was--
[00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:55.560]   Nice.
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.400]   I really enjoyed doing videos when I was in gadget.
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.280]   They were fools.
[00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.200]   If you went to them and said, hey, we ought to do more videos,
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.760]   they are sitting in the 1950s or something.
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.040]   Because really, these days, that's the thing to do.
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.560]   No one can walk around a car and say horsepower pricing.
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:13.360]   What is it?
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.880]   Wait a minute.
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:14.360]   I can't.
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.760]   Yes.
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.200]   Some of the biggest videos on YouTube,
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.560]   but I know because I watch a lot of them are about cars.
[00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:20.120]   They're huge.
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.880]   They are.
[00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:21.720]   It's amazing.
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.320]   The car videos, especially the ones where the person just walks
[00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.560]   around the car with their phone.
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.320]   They get a million hits.
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.440]   This is how the glove compartment opens.
[00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:33.720]   Because if you're on the market--
[00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:39.600]   I know because I watched every monkey video there was waiting
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.240]   for my monkey because it was a long wait.
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.600]   I think there's a hunger for that information
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.000]   that you can't get, especially now because going into a show
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.920]   room might be a little--
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:53.320]   And you want to get in and out and on with your life.
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.240]   But if you go online, you can see everything about that car
[00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.160]   because someone takes the time to share the intricacies
[00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:00.920]   of that vehicle.
[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:01.800]   Right.
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.440]   No knock on car and driver, but really, they missed a bet there.
[00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.760]   They should have had Roberto become their video guy.
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.240]   But now you could do it yourself.
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.320]   And that's really always the best.
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:11.560]   Anyways, great to see you back.
[00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:12.480]   Welcome.
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:13.320]   Thanks for having me back.
[00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:14.320]   Yeah.
[00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:14.920]   Yeah.
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:18.360]   Also with us, it's the dynamic duo.
[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.640]   I don't know why, but we always put them together.
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:25.320]   Owen, JJ Stono, doctor, great to see you.
[00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:26.840]   Look at you in your beautiful studio.
[00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:27.880]   This is your new--
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:28.080]   It's a lot.
[00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.280]   --new place.
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.240]   It is my new place.
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.360]   And just a quick--
[00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.680]   I tried to do the show, first time using Zoom ever,
[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:36.760]   I did it for you.
[00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.840]   I tried to do it on my new M1, which I--
[00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.000]   Oh, you're mad.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   I haven't--
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   No, I've had it since it first came out.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.200]   This is the third time I've turned it on.
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:49.560]   But I tried to do it today for Ant, for hands-on photography.
[00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.480]   And in honor of him, my background
[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.680]   has the holy trinity of RF lenses.
[00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:54.840]   Look at that.
[00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:55.280]   Look at that.
[00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:00.160]   DJI Ronin S2, and my Canon R5 over there.
[00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.280]   I tried to use a free Ant, because he yells me,
[00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.560]   because I have too much technology that I don't use.
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:05.800]   And he feels this is why I'm wasting it.
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:06.680]   But I tried.
[00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.440]   But Zoom came up with some little pop-up
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:10.800]   and said, you are not M1 compliant.
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.760]   Would you like to download M1 something?
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:14.520]   And I kept freezing and dying.
[00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:16.760]   And now I got jetpacks going with my--
[00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:18.920]   You're on your thread ripper, which
[00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:23.280]   means you've got 18 fans to go with your 18 cores.
[00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:24.880]   But the mini was going to be so quiet.
[00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:26.720]   I was trying to plan for success.
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:27.680]   That's all right.
[00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:28.600]   You look good.
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:29.640]   You look good.
[00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:30.960]   What's the video card in there?
[00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:36.120]   It's one of those 360--
[00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.120]   One of those.
[00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.240]   One of those is it in video or AMD.
[00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:40.040]   Let's start with the--
[00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:40.520]   It's a mini.
[00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:41.320]   OK, good.
[00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.840]   It's like a 30, 60, 30, 80, something like that.
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:48.360]   Yeah, it's the reason why I can't go back to this.
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.760]   And one thing, the flow of what I'm used to doing
[00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:52.240]   is just different.
[00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.000]   I'm trying so hard to make myself use this because I spent
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:54.840]   money on it.
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:56.200]   I should be using it.
[00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:57.360]   But nothing works on it.
[00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:59.160]   So I've got to go back to using Apple stuff.
[00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:00.480]   And I'm trying to get--
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:01.600]   I sent you my Osmo.
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:02.560]   You send me your mini.
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:04.080]   It all works fine.
[00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:04.720]   You can have it.
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:05.440]   No, I don't want it.
[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:06.880]   I don't want it.
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:08.600]   In fact, well, I'll tell you a story a second.
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.960]   But I have to introduce the other half of the dynamic duo
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:13.400]   who's never going to get a word in an edgewise between Roberto
[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.400]   and Owen J.J. Stone.
[00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:19.360]   Well, maybe not, because George Adao is the Galadriel
[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:21.120]   of psychotherapists.
[00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:22.800]   Hello, Georgia.
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:23.760]   Hello.
[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:24.640]   Good to see you.
[00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:26.800]   YouTube.com/GeorgeAdao.
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:27.920]   Brand new channel.
[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:29.760]   Congratulations.
[00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:30.400]   I know.
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:30.740]   I know.
[00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:32.440]   So stressful.
[00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:35.120]   You're becoming a YouTube sensation
[00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:37.960]   because you started with doing that show with Renee Ritchie,
[00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:38.600]   Apple Talk.
[00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:38.960]   And now you've got--
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.040]   Apple Talk, yeah.
[00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:43.440]   George Adao, Psychology, Technology, Life.
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:44.840]   Wow.
[00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:45.680]   That's a lot.
[00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:47.160]   Yeah, slowly but surely.
[00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:47.800]   I'm trying.
[00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:48.960]   It is the weirdest thing.
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:50.680]   Building up a channel from Nothing
[00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:52.440]   is the weirdest.
[00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:56.640]   And Renee, who's like a YouTube guru, like he's like, do this.
[00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:56.960]   Do that.
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:59.360]   I'm like, I'm just going to try to--
[00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:02.080]   I'm just happy I have a channel and I'm going to produce videos.
[00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:04.000]   And then hopefully people will watch them.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.760]   Well, we're going to get some more people watching.
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:07.880]   I'm like, and guarantee you.
[00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:08.640]   Thank you.
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:09.200]   That's great.
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:12.080]   Everybody wants to be a YouTube star these days.
[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:14.160]   It's the wave of the future.
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.760]   Well, I figured what are we doing right now?
[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:18.040]   We might as well do this.
[00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:19.560]   Like I have all this extra time.
[00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:20.920]   If I'm going to do it at any point--
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:21.640]   That's a good point.
[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:22.840]   I guess that's why, right?
[00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:24.560]   And I'm just going to do it now.
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:27.480]   And I can't reach that many people.
[00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:30.520]   I'm seeing people on days off and trying.
[00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:32.040]   So I'm like, well, this could kind of help.
[00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:32.560]   So--
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:33.040]   Good.
[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:34.040]   Hopefully.
[00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:34.480]   Hopefully.
[00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:34.960]   Well, talk.
[00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:37.360]   Let me create my YouTube story real quick on Gileo.
[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:37.800]   Yes, sir.
[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:40.760]   So back in the day, you remember a long time ago
[00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:42.720]   when I first thing out with you, I was doing YouTube.
[00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:44.960]   I had like 10,000 subscribers.
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:47.920]   I was getting my little $600 a month from YouTube.
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:48.920]   Life was good.
[00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:52.280]   And then one day, my YouTube locked me out.
[00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:53.760]   When they switched from having a username
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:55.520]   to you had to have a Google account.
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:57.200]   And for some reason, I could not get into it.
[00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:59.320]   I tried to contact people for years.
[00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:01.240]   I could never get back into this account.
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:03.040]   And so it just disheartened me on the whole thing,
[00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:04.680]   because I got money racking up in a place
[00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:06.400]   that I can't get because they suspended it,
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:08.760]   because I couldn't log in to verify stuff.
[00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:11.560]   Long story short, 10 years later, I'm at a client's house
[00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:12.760]   a month ago.
[00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:15.240]   And I log into YouTube to show how to do things.
[00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:16.080]   I log in.
[00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:19.240]   I'm like, why is my logo for your profile picture?
[00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:21.360]   Why does it have dollar signs on it?
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:22.640]   He's like, what is you?
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:24.240]   He's like, I thought you just put it there to remind me
[00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:25.240]   that that was you.
[00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:28.920]   I log in and it attached my YouTube brand account
[00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:29.800]   to his email.
[00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:30.960]   Oh my God.
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:32.440]   He's been with my thing for 10 years
[00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:34.160]   and never thought to say a thing.
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:36.360]   So I finally got my original YouTube account back.
[00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:38.240]   I'm down to 3,000 subscribers.
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:40.560]   But like, Jesus said, it's hard.
[00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:42.360]   And then starting from scratch, because I finally
[00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:43.360]   started over again.
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:44.960]   I'm like, man, it's so much work starting over.
[00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:48.000]   But that channel has like millions of views on it.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.480]   And I'm like, I finally get it back.
[00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:51.880]   So I think I'm going to switch over to the old account.
[00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:52.240]   What is it?
[00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:54.160]   YouTube.com/
[00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:55.440]   Oh, doc to 79.
[00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:57.080]   Don't go to it because this old video is me,
[00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:57.640]   Rant and Rave.
[00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:58.680]   And I got to put new stuff up there.
[00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:00.200]   But I'm just trying to take a look.
[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:01.680]   Now we're going to all go take a look.
[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:04.120]   When you say don't go, we all go.
[00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:05.440]   Oh, why is this?
[00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:07.520]   Don't play it on air at all, Uncle Leo.
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:10.000]   But click videos and scroll all the way down
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.200]   to the first video.
[00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:12.640]   Oh, and JJ stones.
[00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:13.440]   This is the right one to do.
[00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:15.800]   Very first.
[00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:17.360]   Holy cow.
[00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:18.680]   Look at all these.
[00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:19.120]   You're right.
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:20.280]   You don't want to give these up.
[00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:21.360]   These are too good.
[00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:22.240]   What is that?
[00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:24.800]   What is asko.com, that one?
[00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:27.640]   That guy is doing a Tony Sopranos impression.
[00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:29.520]   Watch it when you get home or later on tonight.
[00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:30.720]   I paid that guy.
[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:33.960]   I was doing ads and memes before people were doing music.
[00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:35.080]   That video is 12 years old.
[00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:36.960]   12 years ago.
[00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:39.040]   Unserviced with only 1400 views.
[00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:40.480]   I got videos with half a million views.
[00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:41.560]   That's unserviced.
[00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:43.920]   That guy does a great Tony Sopranos impression.
[00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:45.160]   I'll tell you how old this is.
[00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:49.200]   He's got a review of the movie Bottleschock on it.
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:51.400]   Oh, I went out there for the movie premieres.
[00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:53.160]   And he flew me out to California.
[00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:55.520]   I got to drink with the actors and drink some wine.
[00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:58.040]   The only time I ever drink wine was my trip.
[00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:00.640]   I did a reaction video to Tony Soprano
[00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:02.720]   on his going to see his therapist.
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:03.880]   Oh, yeah.
[00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:05.080]   That's him on the therapist.
[00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:07.040]   I actually plays the female therapist
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:08.640]   while he's being knocked down.
[00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:09.840]   Dr. Melphy.
[00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:11.320]   Dr. Melphy.
[00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:14.000]   That was actually a big deal when Tony Soprano,
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.440]   when the Sopranos came out because--
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:16.520]   Made a huge difference.
[00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:19.960]   He was a made man talking to a shrink.
[00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:20.760]   And she was good.
[00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:21.760]   It was good.
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:22.260]   Yeah.
[00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.440]   Those were some of the best dialogues in that show.
[00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:25.960]   That was a great part of the show.
[00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:27.760]   Yeah.
[00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:30.120]   Well, thank you so much for joining us, everybody.
[00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:30.960]   I'm exhausted.
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:31.960]   I don't know.
[00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:33.240]   This is just the introduction.
[00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:35.160]   We have only gotten to the introduction.
[00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:39.240]   And we have now been speaking for an hour.
[00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:40.440]   Oh, I've subscribed.
[00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:41.280]   I've liked.
[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:41.960]   I'm good to go.
[00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:43.200]   Nice seeing you all.
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:44.200]   Bye.
[00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:44.700]   Bye.
[00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:45.200]   I got it.
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:46.200]   We're done.
[00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:47.200]   We're done.
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:48.720]   Would you ever do this?
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:53.320]   Twitch is, of course, probably as popular these days
[00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:55.240]   with the young people as YouTube.
[00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:57.760]   But certainly people are making a lot of money on Twitch.
[00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:00.200]   Do you know what a subathon is?
[00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:01.480]   Have you heard about this?
[00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:02.080]   Yeah.
[00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:03.600]   You guys do because you're with it.
[00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:05.040]   The idea is it's a marathon.
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:06.920]   But instead of asking for money for a charity,
[00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:12.240]   as you might on a telethon, you are asking for subscribers.
[00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:16.160]   So Ludwig Ogren, who is already probably pretty successful
[00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:18.760]   on the Twitch, did something kind of dumb.
[00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:22.240]   He made it to the New York Times, which means it's really dumb.
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:25.240]   He said, I will extend my subathon for 10 seconds
[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:28.480]   for every new subscriber I get.
[00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:30.360]   Do the math, Ludwig.
[00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:35.320]   You're never, ever going to get to stop.
[00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:35.840]   He--
[00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:37.880]   But how many subscribers did he get?
[00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:38.320]   I don't know.
[00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:40.280]   We should check out his--
[00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:41.640]   He's done 70 hours.
[00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:45.000]   Now, he still sleeps, eats, showers.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:45.680]   He wears shorts.
[00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:48.720]   But it's now all on Twitch.
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:50.960]   He says, the weirdest thing is every time I wake up,
[00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:52.760]   it feels like it gets bigger and bigger.
[00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:56.640]   Last night, I went to bed with 30,000 viewers and 60,000 subs.
[00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:59.280]   I woke up and I was at 70,000 viewers.
[00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:00.440]   And 70,000 subs.
[00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:04.520]   And do the math because that's 10,000 new subscribers times
[00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:05.200]   10 seconds.
[00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:07.120]   He's never going to get to stop.
[00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:09.920]   He's going to have to break his promise at some point.
[00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:11.520]   No, just keep going.
[00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:12.560]   Really?
[00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:13.560]   Just keep going.
[00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:14.360]   The Truman Show.
[00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:15.360]   We got the Truman Show.
[00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:16.880]   I just came back in the day.
[00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:18.040]   He reinvented.
[00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:20.480]   That's how Twitch started, right?
[00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:23.080]   Justin.tv became Twitch.
[00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:25.520]   That's how it started, live streaming.
[00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:27.440]   What was the girl who--
[00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:30.080]   Like the first who shared everything in her life.
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:30.600]   Just--
[00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:31.600]   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:34.080]   Well before Justine, yeah.
[00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:35.440]   Oh, I can't remember your name.
[00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:36.920]   I feel like I'm already--
[00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:38.040]   Because I'm old in my--
[00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:40.080]   And nothing exciting ever happened,
[00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:43.880]   although there was a little bit of semi-nudity and stuff.
[00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:44.600]   Oh, yeah.
[00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:45.720]   First live streamer.
[00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:47.480]   Let's see if Google remembers.
[00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:50.440]   Google never forgets.
[00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:54.840]   The first person to do life casting.
[00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:56.000]   Yeah, I think this is it.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.200]   Let's see here.
[00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:02.280]   [SINGING]
[00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:03.160]   There's a lot of it.
[00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:09.200]   This goes back to Yale University in the '70s or something.
[00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:10.040]   That's not it.
[00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:10.560]   No, no, no.
[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:11.520]   There's a woman.
[00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:13.880]   I know who you're talking about, and they don't mention her.
[00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:15.920]   I don't think she said lonely girl.
[00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:17.080]   I felt lonely girls like--
[00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:17.600]   There you go.
[00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:18.640]   That was fake.
[00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:19.800]   That was like a skit.
[00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:20.800]   Yeah.
[00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:22.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.480]   That was the first time we realized that the internet lies.
[00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:25.920]   Then there was Steve--
[00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:28.040]   Then there was Steve Mann, this guy.
[00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:29.280]   Jenny Cam.
[00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:29.960]   Jenny Cam.
[00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:31.200]   That's the one he was thinking of.
[00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:34.040]   Jenny Cam, very good.
[00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:34.960]   Do you remember Steve Mann?
[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:36.320]   This is the guy from MIT.
[00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:38.080]   He was the first live streamer.
[00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:39.080]   Would you date this guy?
[00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:40.080]   Oh, yeah.
[00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:42.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:43.800]   Someone he has.
[00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:45.680]   Now everyone has somebody.
[00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:48.040]   I mean, we're laughing, but he's just in the future.
[00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:50.000]   Like, people are trying to put Google Glass on their head
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:50.560]   and stuff now.
[00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:51.200]   I mean, he's just--
[00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:52.360]   He invented it.
[00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:54.520]   Practically.
[00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:56.760]   Jennifer Ringley's Jenny Cam.
[00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:59.720]   This is what you remember, Roberto, from your teen years,
[00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:02.840]   1996 through 2004.
[00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:05.000]   She did it for eight years.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   Wow.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:06.520]   Wow.
[00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:09.480]   See, this guy can hang out for eight years, at least,
[00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:12.920]   because interest is going to wane.
[00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:17.200]   And eventually he'll be able to stop and do whatever he does
[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:18.840]   in his off time when he isn't on camera.
[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:19.760]   I don't know.
[00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:22.400]   I don't know. People have really long memories.
[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:23.360]   I don't know.
[00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:24.840]   Especially when you say you're going to do it.
[00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:27.200]   And then they've subscribed to you, so you do it.
[00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:30.000]   Now they feel they have ownership over you.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:30.440]   I don't know.
[00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:32.320]   You're going to see it in just 10 seconds.
[00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:34.440]   So eventually he'll run out of time.
[00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:36.440]   It'll be a while.
[00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:39.720]   He might miss family weddings and--
[00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:41.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:43.200]   --talkers, employment.
[00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:44.280]   Right.
[00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:47.200]   How many people want to date someone not knowing
[00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:51.000]   that their entire life is going to be on camera?
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   His girlfriend is one of his roommates.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.400]   And he has other roommates, too.
[00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:57.800]   So she's already probably accepted this on camera.
[00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:58.800]   Yeah.
[00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:01.600]   Somehow I'm watching him.
[00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:03.960]   And I guess he's still doing it.
[00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:05.440]   But he's doing others-- oh, no.
[00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:07.400]   There he is in the corner.
[00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:08.080]   He's showing--
[00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:09.800]   Does that have a countdown?
[00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:12.800]   Look at the viewers and the subscribers.
[00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:14.920]   I mean, he's incredible.
[00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:15.400]   Yeah.
[00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:16.600]   And he plays games.
[00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:17.800]   I think he's OK about it.
[00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:19.280]   He just breaks.
[00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:21.760]   He does other stuff.
[00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:23.160]   He does cooking.
[00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:24.120]   He's got roommates.
[00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:25.320]   Yeah, he does other stuff.
[00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:29.680]   He's got 1.9 million followers now, so it must be working.
[00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:30.640]   I think he's OK.
[00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:31.680]   He might be doing OK.
[00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:33.520]   1.9 million followers-- oh, all right.
[00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:35.000]   Here we go.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.360]   Let's get some Wolfram Alpha out.
[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:38.920]   Are you going to do some math for us?
[00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:41.280]   Do you need math for us?
[00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:42.000]   Times 10 seconds.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   What is that equal?
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.800]   Times 10 seconds.
[00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:46.400]   I'm going to leave.
[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:47.600]   Followers are subscribers.
[00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:48.760]   We need the number of subscribers.
[00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:49.680]   How many people are subscribed?
[00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:50.320]   What's the difference?
[00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:51.160]   Is there a difference?
[00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:52.720]   And they have to be the news subscribers.
[00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:53.600]   Your subscribers pay.
[00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:55.120]   Followers are just free.
[00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:56.640]   I need the number of subscribers.
[00:16:56.640 --> 00:17:00.120]   Oh, I didn't know this was a money deal.
[00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:00.520]   Oh, yes.
[00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:01.520]   That's a money.
[00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:02.440]   Ain't no one free.
[00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:03.840]   Uncle Leo?
[00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:04.160]   Nothing free.
[00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:08.000]   So you're saying if you subscribe, you pay some money.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.400]   And you get 10 seconds.
[00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:11.400]   You're subscription by $5 a month.
[00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:16.400]   But I wonder where it says how many subscribers he has.
[00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:18.400]   Maybe it doesn't say how many subscribers he has.
[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:19.400]   It could be right underneath this thing.
[00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:20.400]   The red ticker.
[00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:21.400]   The red number just tick it up.
[00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:22.400]   It should be the subscribers.
[00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:23.400]   That's 63,000.
[00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:25.400]   OK, 63,000.
[00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:26.400]   That's amazing.
[00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:29.400]   I feel bad for kicking your seat on purpose.
[00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:30.400]   What's that number?
[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:32.400]   We should have just told you it's a boy.
[00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:34.400]   I wish you didn't have to hear all that.
[00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:37.400]   I promise I will not eat anymore.
[00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:38.400]   What am I hearing?
[00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:43.400]   I've launched some videos somewhere that I can't stop.
[00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:45.400]   It's coming from inside the house.
[00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:46.400]   So I don't know.
[00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:47.400]   Maybe this is--
[00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:48.400]   Oh, it's--
[00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:49.400]   Maybe this is--
[00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:50.400]   That's only 175 hours.
[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:52.400]   No, it's like a week.
[00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:54.400]   It's 63,000 times 10 seconds.
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:57.400]   Well, we're going to make him do it forever now.
[00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:58.400]   Yeah, it's only a week.
[00:17:58.400 --> 00:17:59.400]   Enjoy the new subs.
[00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:01.400]   Everyone go follow this guy.
[00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:02.400]   Unfollow, refollow.
[00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:03.400]   Just like mess with him.
[00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:08.400]   Just like mess with him.
[00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:11.400]   Mess up the algorithm.
[00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:13.400]   Oh, I got the ad because I'm not subscribed.
[00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:14.400]   That's why.
[00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:15.400]   That's what I was hearing.
[00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:18.400]   Even though I have him muted because I didn't want to hear it,
[00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:20.400]   you still hear the ad even though.
[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:21.400]   You still hear the ad?
[00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:24.400]   So for him being live for a week of his life--
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:27.400]   for eight days of his life-- he made $300,000 minus their
[00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:30.400]   subscription charge-- I mean, minus Amazon's charge fee.
[00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:32.400]   So he made almost like 250 grand.
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:34.400]   Five bucks per 10 seconds.
[00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:37.400]   So that means he's making $30 a minute.
[00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:38.400]   Five bucks per month.
[00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:42.400]   Yeah, but every subscriber has to pay five bucks up front, right?
[00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:43.400]   Yeah.
[00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:46.400]   So he's making-- he's already-- I mean, that's good money.
[00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:47.400]   I'd take it.
[00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:48.400]   Yeah.
[00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:49.400]   So that's about 100--
[00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:50.400]   You already do that, Leo.
[00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:51.400]   --a little bit more.
[00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:54.400]   That's about a month's worth of work if you work five days a week,
[00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:55.400]   eight and a half, nine hours a day.
[00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:59.400]   So in a month of work, which, you know, really seven and a half
[00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:01.400]   days, eight days of whatever, he's made a lot of money.
[00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:02.400]   More than I have.
[00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:06.400]   And now I'm wondering, maybe I should pivot my life.
[00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:07.400]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:09.400]   You've got to think if you're Jenny, you're going, what the hell?
[00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:13.400]   I got to-- it's like, oh, I could have made some money on this.
[00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:15.400]   By the way, Jenny, get ready.
[00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:17.400]   Jenny is 44 now.
[00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:18.400]   Oh, wow.
[00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:22.400]   So times flies.
[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:24.400]   All right, that was our first story.
[00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:26.400]   I don't know what else to do after that.
[00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:28.400]   Talk about another subscription thing real quick, then?
[00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:29.400]   Yes, what?
[00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:31.400]   Talk about Twitter subscriptions.
[00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:37.400]   Yeah, would you pay-- Twitter's going back and forth, among other things.
[00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:39.400]   They haven't decided how they're going to make money.
[00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:40.400]   That's really the problem.
[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:42.400]   When they grow up, what are they going to do?
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:46.400]   Now they're saying maybe-- and this was somebody discovered this.
[00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:48.400]   This isn't something Twitter said.
[00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:52.400]   What if we let you undo tweets if you paid?
[00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:57.400]   Would you pay to be-- have an undoable tweet?
[00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:01.400]   Oh, it gives you like a little bit of time before it goes live.
[00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:02.400]   Is that what it is?
[00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:03.400]   Yeah, we've known about this for a while.
[00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:05.400]   We've seen this progress bar.
[00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:10.400]   Here, this is from a researcher, Jane Manchen Wong.
[00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:12.400]   Here's the progress bar.
[00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:16.400]   So you see, you can undo it for that period of time.
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:21.400]   That seems kind of odd because-- I mean, this is kind of like Gmail does, right?
[00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:25.400]   It just doesn't post the tweet for that period of time.
[00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:27.400]   That's not a lot.
[00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:32.400]   Usually, it's not that much time before you figure out you did something that you shouldn't have done.
[00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:34.400]   OK, I just have a tip for you.
[00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:39.400]   Keep your finger off the mouse button until you're sure you got the right tweet.
[00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:41.400]   Who does that rule with us?
[00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:42.400]   Yeah, let's just say it.
[00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:43.400]   Some people shouldn't be tweeting.
[00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:48.400]   Some people should have their phones taken away from them and just don't.
[00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:49.400]   Don't.
[00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:51.400]   If you're feeling upset, these are the rules.
[00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:52.400]   It's like dealing with a dangerous animal.
[00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:53.400]   You don't tweet.
[00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:54.400]   You don't talk.
[00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:55.400]   You don't call.
[00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:56.400]   You don't write.
[00:20:56.400 --> 00:21:02.400]   If you're feeling angry upset, frustrated or sad, if you're drinking, just stay away from
[00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:03.400]   someone.
[00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:07.400]   So in this case, you're the dangerous animal that you're trying to stay away from.
[00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:08.400]   Yes.
[00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:09.400]   Yes.
[00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:10.400]   It's your limbic system.
[00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:11.400]   It's your primal part of your brain.
[00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:15.400]   It's going to send something from a thick.
[00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:19.400]   Georgia, you know that I love you.
[00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:23.400]   That last statement you just said, someone who makes a statement who is a happy and healthy
[00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:24.400]   relationship.
[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:29.400]   The fact that you think there's some kind of thing, you know how many drunk people have
[00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:31.400]   been upset and went back to the ex?
[00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:33.400]   You think people can do that?
[00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:34.400]   I don't think so.
[00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:37.400]   You've been having a drunk tweeting bear or worse than drunk.
[00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:38.400]   You don't wear it for anybody.
[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:40.400]   It is worse because it's there.
[00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:41.400]   It lives forever.
[00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:42.400]   It lives forever.
[00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:43.400]   It lives forever.
[00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:47.400]   Don't do it because we're not trained from young.
[00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:52.400]   Let's say it because we used to be able to call someone up on the phone and then they'll
[00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:53.400]   forget.
[00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:58.400]   But you tweeted out, it is their stamped forever that will haunt you 20 years from now.
[00:21:58.400 --> 00:21:59.400]   So here's a perfect example.
[00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:00.400]   On to it.
[00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:02.240]   Alexia McCammond.
[00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:08.320]   She had just been nominated to be the editor in chief of Teen Vogue, really prime job,
[00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:09.320]   right?
[00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:12.800]   She's a young woman, African American.
[00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:16.680]   She had tweeted as a teenager.
[00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:21.720]   She had tweeted a couple of things interpreted as racist.
[00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:24.080]   For which, by the way, she'd apologized already.
[00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:28.440]   But when this came up, somebody brought it up.
[00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:29.440]   She resigned.
[00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:30.440]   She said, "All right.
[00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:35.560]   I'm going to voluntarily leave because it would be difficult for Connie Nast and the
[00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:38.600]   folks at Teen Vogue.
[00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:39.920]   I'll read you the tweets."
[00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:43.880]   I mean, there's certainly not anything to be proud of.
[00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:47.120]   But remember, she did this as a teenager, right?
[00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:50.920]   I've done a lot of stupid stuff when I was a teenager.
[00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:51.920]   She's in high school.
[00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:54.080]   Let me see if I can find it.
[00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:56.920]   She's in high school.
[00:22:56.920 --> 00:23:00.200]   In one case, let me see if I can find it.
[00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:05.920]   The worst part is that if she had committed a crime, it would be wiped, right?
[00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:09.240]   But we don't have any rules for that.
[00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:14.200]   Thank God I didn't have the internet and I was not whatever live streaming my life.
[00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:15.200]   It would be horrific.
[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:16.600]   I would be mortified.
[00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:19.120]   I don't know.
[00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:22.680]   I think that we have a right to be forgotten and I specially think that for people that
[00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:27.120]   are under the age, before your brain is fully cooked, which is like 24.
[00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:33.320]   You're prefrontal cortex is the part that deals with consequences to actions is not fully
[00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:37.640]   developed until about 24.
[00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:39.880]   We're going to do all kinds of horrific things.
[00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:42.920]   Let's just say it with hormones, we become a little bit less intelligent when we're going
[00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:44.280]   through our teen years.
[00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:45.280]   Oh, yeah.
[00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:47.160]   And it's out there forever.
[00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:50.000]   I was a complete idiot when I was a teenager.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.720]   I think back about things I thought was a good idea at the time.
[00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:56.280]   Like, oh, I'll just do this and that'll be fine.
[00:23:56.280 --> 00:24:00.080]   And then I think back on I'm like, who thinks that's a good idea?
[00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:02.960]   What's wrong with your time?
[00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:05.200]   Here's the three tweets.
[00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:09.360]   And remember now she's in high school.
[00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:11.760]   Gave me a two out of 10 on my chem problem.
[00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:12.760]   Cross out all my work.
[00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:14.680]   Don't explain what I did wrong.
[00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:18.800]   Makes a lot stupid Asian TA.
[00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:23.360]   And then she says outdone by Asian now googling how not to wake up with swollen Asian eyes.
[00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:24.760]   Okay, they're racist.
[00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:25.760]   Oh, yeah.
[00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:31.320]   Those are their racist, especially now we're very sensitive about racism against Asian
[00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:33.240]   Americans.
[00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:40.680]   However, it was 10 years ago, she was in high school, obviously.
[00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:41.680]   I don't know.
[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:43.080]   What is the statute of limitations on tweets?
[00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:44.080]   I guess it's there's.
[00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:51.520]   There's a Beastie Boys documentary that's on Apple TV plus whatever they're calling it
[00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:53.440]   now.
[00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:57.560]   And they talked to one of the guys and they say, you know, you used to be these hard,
[00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:01.320]   you know, it was all about partying and you had this song, girls and whatever.
[00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:02.840]   And now you're doing this other thing.
[00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:07.120]   And he said, he's like, well, you know, I'd rather grow as a person than just sort of
[00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:12.680]   be stuck, you know, just in amber as this like, you know, loud, obnoxious party person.
[00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:18.680]   I think people, they grow 10 years from when, you know, from when I was 18 till I was 21,
[00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:24.360]   I said, this huge growth and I, you know, it doesn't, those tweets are horrible and,
[00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:27.280]   and, you know, she should be ashamed of them.
[00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:31.080]   She apologized two years ago before this job.
[00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:35.400]   She deleted the tweets.
[00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:36.720]   I don't, this is a tough one.
[00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:39.000]   It's just tough when you're, yeah, it's tough because you're a teenager.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.640]   Like if she was 21 and she had done that, I'm like, well, now, but you're such a
[00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:44.560]   idiot when you're a teenager.
[00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:50.040]   It's, it's tough to, it's, that's where, you know, you know, education doesn't teach,
[00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:52.520]   you know, when I was in school, they didn't teach us about finance.
[00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:54.560]   So we all screwed up on that.
[00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:56.480]   And now they're not really teaching other than bullying.
[00:25:56.480 --> 00:26:01.560]   They don't, I don't think they really teach kids about the what happens in, with social
[00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:04.600]   media because their parents might not get it because they're like, well, I'm not going
[00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:06.760]   to use Facebook or I'm not using Twitter.
[00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:09.560]   So they're not getting the information from, from school.
[00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:12.440]   They're not getting it from their parents.
[00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:14.200]   And so they're just like, Oh, I'll just put this thing out there.
[00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:18.200]   Twitter isn't real, which is, you know, this thing that people have been saying forever,
[00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:19.720]   which is untrue.
[00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:21.520]   And then it comes back to haunt them.
[00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:23.800]   Oh, and what do you think?
[00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:27.200]   So everybody knows, I'll talk about it a million times.
[00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:29.240]   I have a teenager.
[00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:35.400]   There have been kids at her school that have gone on Instagram, Snapchat and said vulgar
[00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:38.680]   things about black kids, Asian kids.
[00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:44.040]   And next thing they're getting threatened by other kids to get beat up, they get suspended
[00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:45.040]   from school.
[00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:47.040]   Bad things happen.
[00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:52.120]   The only line I draw between that kind of language is comedians saying stuff because
[00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:57.280]   they're trying to be funny and hyperbolic and regular people because even as a kid, not
[00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:58.600]   for nothing, she's black, right?
[00:26:58.600 --> 00:26:59.600]   I think she's black.
[00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:00.600]   Yeah, she's black.
[00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:05.160]   So she should know better growing up in a household about racism and how cruel it is
[00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:06.560]   to make fun of people.
[00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:09.120]   Tell me how old she is does not matter to me.
[00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:14.640]   If she's old enough to have a phone and a device and make comments, does she as an African-American
[00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:18.680]   woman should definitely know not to talk about somebody else's race?
[00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:24.240]   So I don't have a sympathy for the 12, 15, whatever, cuz I have a teenage daughter.
[00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:28.720]   And Lord knows we talk about a lot of stuff and maybe I'm raised my kid a little bit better.
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:32.960]   But there's a difference between your ideology and what you think.
[00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:37.000]   And just because you thought that a 10 doesn't mean you're not gonna think that a 20, I believe
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.480]   the racism kind of carries on.
[00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:42.440]   That's why we got to wait for it to age out because racism back in the 70s hasn't just
[00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:46.160]   changed his mind in the last 10 years because the rest of the world's woke.
[00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:47.560]   He grew up with it.
[00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:49.880]   He stayed with it and it hasn't changed.
[00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:53.940]   Now you get caught and you apologize because you want to keep a cushy job, but I'm not just
[00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:58.560]   gonna expel the fact that you as a black woman were making fun of another person because
[00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:00.040]   of their race.
[00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:01.640]   I'm just out on that.
[00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:06.280]   >> I mean, if she's got to change her name, whatever she's got to do, cool.
[00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:10.400]   >> She'll be, this is gonna haunt her the rest of her life.
[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:15.160]   Does it change anything Owen that she would have then, she has to give up her opportunity
[00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:20.080]   to be a black editor in chief of Teen Vogue?
[00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:21.600]   >> I believe in redemption.
[00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:26.080]   I believe in forgiveness and whatever she's, whatever past she has to do, she apologizes.
[00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:27.560]   She says there's no excuse.
[00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:28.800]   I am so sorry.
[00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:32.320]   And hopefully she makes a way in her life to make a change in that.
[00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:35.000]   But she's also choosing a career where she's in the public eye.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:38.520]   She's working for other companies and businesses that have to have relationships with other
[00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:39.520]   people.
[00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:41.480]   So that's a problem for her.
[00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:43.640]   Again, I understand that people make mistakes.
[00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:46.920]   I understand that people can change and they should have an opportunity to change.
[00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:50.600]   But at the same time, I'm not gonna cry for her because she lost her opportunity because
[00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:57.160]   of a mistake that she made when she was a child, which again, in her specific circumstance,
[00:28:57.160 --> 00:28:58.360]   she should know better.
[00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:01.760]   Again, that's just me and that's a different form of opinion.
[00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:03.760]   But hopefully she finds another way in life.
[00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:04.760]   There's other jobs in the world.
[00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:07.480]   She'd go and have a very successful, happy, healthy life.
[00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:08.480]   Maybe she changed her name.
[00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:09.480]   Maybe she moves to Europe.
[00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:10.680]   I don't know what she does.
[00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:13.640]   But I'm not boo-hooing for her.
[00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:16.680]   >> Is it the parents fault, maybe Georgia?
[00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:20.560]   >> Usually it's a whole bunch of reasons, not just the parents.
[00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:25.160]   It's also the culture that you're grown up in, right?
[00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:27.720]   There's just so many pieces to this.
[00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:28.720]   It's really messy.
[00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:31.760]   But the thing is, is that if she had robbed a bank, it would have been expunged.
[00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:36.920]   If at this age she had done some sort of a crime, we would not know about it and she
[00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:39.240]   would have been absolved from this.
[00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:44.840]   >> That's because the legal system understands that things you do as a teenager shouldn't
[00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:46.640]   haunt you for life.
[00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:48.280]   >> But now it is, right?
[00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:54.240]   Social media has created a format where everything is gonna follow you.
[00:29:54.240 --> 00:30:01.160]   And let's just say it, if everything that I ever said was taped and sent out and all
[00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:05.600]   the stupid things that I've done were taped and sent out to the world, none of us would
[00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:07.400]   be able to do anything, right?
[00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:08.400]   We all make mistakes.
[00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:10.520]   We all do stupid things.
[00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:17.120]   And I just think that we can sometimes grab our pitchforks and torches so quickly and come
[00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:21.080]   out to kind of scorch the earth and everyone has to be perfect.
[00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:25.480]   And I think that if people have made, like okay, I'm a therapist, so if you've made
[00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:30.960]   conscious actions to change and be a better person and try to do better, I think that
[00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:34.400]   we should be judging people on who they are today, not who they were a decade ago.
[00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:36.240]   And I think that that makes a huge difference.
[00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:42.960]   If not, we're stuck being painted in a platform that we are no longer that person.
[00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:45.440]   And I don't think that that is fair either.
[00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:47.080]   >> Yeah.
[00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:48.080]   It's interesting.
[00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:52.880]   >> Unless I think my bottom line is Twitter never did anything good for anybody.
[00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:54.680]   Get off the Twitter.
[00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:58.000]   >> I've gotten jobs because of Twitter.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   >> Oh, you have?
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   >> All right, take it back.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:03.840]   >> Yes, I think I went from Mac Live to Gizmodo and to Wired because of Twitter.
[00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:04.840]   >> Because of the tweets?
[00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:10.440]   >> No, no, because people knew me more so and you interact with other journalists.
[00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:11.440]   >> That's a good point.
[00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:13.200]   >> So that sort of helped me, you know.
[00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:16.320]   >> I still know people by their Twitter and not by their own name.
[00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:17.800]   >> But I'm a horrible at Twitter.
[00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:19.680]   My tweets are just ridiculous.
[00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:21.960]   >> It's such a remedy for getting in trouble.
[00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:22.960]   That's just all.
[00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:25.440]   I mean, it's just- >> That's the thing with social media,
[00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:26.440]   right?
[00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:27.440]   It can really only be used against you.
[00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:30.320]   Like, sometimes it's beneficial, but- >> Yeah, nobody brings up.
[00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:33.240]   >> Yeah, and that's where it goes to- >> All the great tweets I said years ago.
[00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:34.720]   Nobody brings us up.
[00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:35.720]   >> Yeah.
[00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:39.960]   Yeah, no, it's unfortunate that we are very reactive right now.
[00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:42.680]   And I think that that's good in some parts and bad in some other parts.
[00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:45.400]   >> I've always said, and I don't get, I can't take credit.
[00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:47.200]   Somebody said this and I just remembered it.
[00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:53.040]   The problem with Twitter is it feels like it's hanging out around the water cooler, where
[00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:55.560]   you say stuff and it disappears.
[00:31:55.560 --> 00:32:00.720]   But in fact, it's a mismatch because in fact, it lasts forever, as we can see.
[00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:04.480]   And so even though you feel like it's just offhand comments, they're far from it.
[00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:07.920]   It's like something you wrote in a book and published and put in a library so that anybody
[00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:09.640]   can find it forever.
[00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:10.640]   So that's the problem.
[00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:12.720]   >> What did Roberto say in 2012?
[00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:13.720]   >> Yeah.
[00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:14.720]   >> Hold on.
[00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:16.200]   Let's see what we could find against him.
[00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:17.200]   >> I bet they saw.
[00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:19.040]   >> And also- >> They're just bad jokes.
[00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:21.080]   That's my pictures and spots.
[00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:22.240]   >> That's too general.
[00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:27.840]   I've said outlandish things on many a show podcast tweet, whatever.
[00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:32.120]   And I usually say it's an FYIA thing, FU in advance, because I know I'm going to say
[00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:33.120]   something outlandish.
[00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:34.120]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:35.120]   >> And I don't believe it.
[00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:39.120]   Whenever I know I'm going to talk crazy, I always say this is an FYIA podcast, this
[00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:40.120]   is an FYIA tweet.
[00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:42.880]   Just so people know, say and go back and look what FYIA means.
[00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:47.760]   But with my daughter, she's had a phone since she was five years old.
[00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:50.720]   And basically, again, because I take the time, like you said earlier, my parents don't
[00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:55.160]   know better, but I progressed her along the lines of, this is how you do this, it's how
[00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:56.320]   you do that.
[00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:58.840]   And I slowly weaned her on to different things.
[00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:01.440]   You got to post on Instagram every day.
[00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:03.840]   So I can show her what to do, how to do it, and Twitter.
[00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:09.800]   Now she's on Twitter going crazy, but she has the benefit of me guiding her along as opposed
[00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:14.560]   to some of her friends and these kids are just saying stuff and I'm like, yo, you play
[00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:16.560]   on getting a job, but I can stay whatever I want.
[00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:17.560]   I work for myself.
[00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:20.400]   If I want to not work tomorrow, I can go do whatever I want.
[00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:24.320]   You could get a face tattoo and you'd be just as employable as ever.
[00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:25.840]   >> Yeah, exactly.
[00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:26.840]   But you got to know where you're at.
[00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:28.880]   And a lot of athletes had to deal with this.
[00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:30.480]   You know, getting drafted at times.
[00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:31.480]   >> Very tough.
[00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:34.840]   >> I feel bad for the white kid that's just singing rap songs.
[00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:37.320]   Like he grew up with athletes, they're rapping songs.
[00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:38.880]   He didn't mean it that way.
[00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:41.280]   And I can read his text and know he didn't mean it that way.
[00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:46.120]   But since he used the word, everybody just goes, we'll see.
[00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:48.320]   So people don't even take context anymore.
[00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:51.040]   So it is very rough and hard to figure out.
[00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:53.880]   But I mean, parents got to do better, kids got to do better.
[00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:56.840]   >> But it's hard with media literacy, right?
[00:33:56.840 --> 00:33:59.280]   Like that's the thing is that media literacy is not taught.
[00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:04.000]   We were, Renee and I were hired to do a talk to actually for one of the states for all
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:09.720]   of the leaders in the state to be able to talk about media savvy and how it works and
[00:34:09.720 --> 00:34:14.080]   what are all the tricks that kind of comes out of trying to divide us and make us into
[00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:19.360]   different tribes and why how they want to try to make us feel emotional, make us feel
[00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:22.440]   angry so that we don't leave.
[00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:26.160]   Which I thought was really awesome because they cared enough to be able to teach all
[00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:30.880]   of the leaders that are in the state in order to help them keep their constituents as media
[00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:32.240]   savvy as possible.
[00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:33.880]   But this isn't a class, right?
[00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:36.800]   Like we're not taught this so a lot of parents have no clue.
[00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:38.800]   They don't even know their kids are on social media.
[00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:40.600]   They don't know anything about it.
[00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:42.160]   And they're not taught in the schools, right?
[00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:45.840]   We go back to not learning finance, not learning, you know, mental health issues.
[00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:48.920]   Like I'm sorry, we can Google geography very efficiently.
[00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:52.720]   But this kind of stuff is could change your life.
[00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:58.200]   >> Part of the problem also is we don't have any experience with a weapon like social
[00:34:58.200 --> 00:34:59.200]   media.
[00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:03.400]   It's so, it's nothing like anything we've seen before.
[00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:06.720]   And so you can say teach media literacy, but who's going to teach it?
[00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:09.560]   Because no one is like, oh, I've been doing this.
[00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:10.560]   I know exactly.
[00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:11.880]   I've been doing this my whole life.
[00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:16.960]   I mean, it's, it's, you know, we're, everybody's making mistakes because this is all brand
[00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:18.040]   new.
[00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:23.760]   One of the things I did note that it's really interesting since President Trump was banned
[00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:30.480]   off Twitter, you, it really turns out in hindsight that was his platform.
[00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:35.400]   He still has plenty of ways to talk to people, but it's surprisingly quiet from Mar-a-Lago
[00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:38.880]   because he doesn't have a platform.
[00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:42.840]   So you really have to say, you know, in the last four years, Twitter might bear some
[00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:49.280]   responsibility for some of the heightened, invective because it gave him a platform.
[00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:55.200]   Now interestingly, Trump announced, or a Trump spokesperson announced today on Fox that President
[00:35:55.200 --> 00:36:00.120]   Trump is going to create his own social media platform.
[00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:04.120]   They, his spokesman said that will completely redefine the game and attract tens of millions
[00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:05.120]   of new users.
[00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:11.800]   Looking at the success of Parler, I could see that perhaps is it going to be called Trumper?
[00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:12.800]   I don't know.
[00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:13.800]   What is it?
[00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:14.800]   What is the call it?
[00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:15.800]   I don't know.
[00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:16.800]   What will it look like?
[00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:20.680]   I think we, you know, even people who use Twitter all the time, they still will quote
[00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:25.880]   tweet people they're angry with, people who have tweeted just or and in your, you're
[00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:26.880]   amplifying them.
[00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:27.880]   You're amplifying them.
[00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:29.800]   You're amplifying that message.
[00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:32.360]   And I mean, these are people who use Twitter all the time.
[00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:37.480]   They know better, but it's, we can't, I think people, we just can't help or something.
[00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:41.120]   I'm angry and just like, don't tweet angry.
[00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:43.320]   No, it shuts down your brain.
[00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:47.640]   Like really physically, what happens inside of the brain when you're really upset is we
[00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:49.120]   go into fight or flight.
[00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:53.600]   We do not know the difference between a emotional attack and a physical attack.
[00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:58.880]   So when someone says something that's against my ideology, who I believe I am as a person
[00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:01.600]   or something that I believe in, it's like I was attacked.
[00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:06.280]   And so what happens is the brain goes into fight or flight, sends an adrenaline and shuts
[00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:07.800]   off the working memory.
[00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:12.000]   That bumpy part of your brain, you're so proud of gone, gone.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.520]   You're like a three year old in a candy shop.
[00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:15.520]   And that's it.
[00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:16.520]   So it feels good.
[00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:17.760]   You want to get at them, but there's no getting at them.
[00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:19.280]   There's just stages of loss.
[00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:20.600]   Fortunately, I'm a coward.
[00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:21.600]   So I never fight.
[00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:22.600]   Thank you.
[00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:24.920]   I just run away.
[00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:26.320]   I'm not on Twitter anymore.
[00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:29.320]   I don't want anything to do with it because I know that I'll get and I have gotten in
[00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:30.320]   trouble.
[00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:33.440]   You know, I've gotten in fights with people that I really didn't want to get in fights
[00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:35.160]   with all because of exactly that.
[00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:40.200]   I got angry and the brain turned off and I said something that I now regret.
[00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:41.280]   But what are you going to do?
[00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:42.280]   You know?
[00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:43.280]   Yeah.
[00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:44.840]   And then it becomes really hard to apologize.
[00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:48.400]   Well worse because everybody else on Twitter jumps on it.
[00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:50.640]   So Duvorex, this is the one that comes to mind.
[00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:53.040]   Duvorex said something I considered insulting.
[00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:56.120]   So I fired back and then I apologize.
[00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:57.120]   I'm sorry, John.
[00:37:57.120 --> 00:37:58.120]   I love you.
[00:37:58.120 --> 00:37:59.120]   I didn't mean to say that.
[00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:00.120]   We're like brothers, et cetera.
[00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:05.480]   Too late because everybody jumped on it and loved it and amplified it and it was over.
[00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:08.240]   And so John and I still hate each other's guts.
[00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:10.320]   Oh, no, no, no, I'm just kidding.
[00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:11.320]   That's true.
[00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:12.320]   No, but it definitely damaged.
[00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:14.120]   I was about to go into a therapeutic intervention.
[00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:17.040]   No, it's damaged our relationship, but that's okay.
[00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:18.360]   It's got one of those.
[00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:19.360]   It's got one of those.
[00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:21.480]   The house has patches on it now.
[00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:23.240]   It's not burnt down completely anymore.
[00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:24.240]   It's got patches.
[00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:25.240]   Yeah.
[00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:26.240]   Two things.
[00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:29.880]   One, for anybody who gets canceled on the internet, you know, they could at least tell
[00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:32.240]   her mom and dad, hey, I could still be president.
[00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:33.240]   That's true.
[00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:34.240]   It's true.
[00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:36.280]   Now it's a qualifying factor.
[00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:37.280]   Yes.
[00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:38.280]   Yeah.
[00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:43.520]   And secondly, just because we're doing the Twitch show, can we talk about the subscription
[00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:44.520]   platform on Twitter?
[00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:45.520]   You did start that.
[00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:46.520]   You did start that.
[00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:49.120]   You brought it up in your first place to be new.
[00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:50.320]   All right, tell you what, let's take a break.
[00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:53.880]   And when we come back, Owen gets to talk about the subscription.
[00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:55.680]   Owen keeps the show on the rails.
[00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:58.560]   No, that's really it's a main reason we have them on.
[00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:01.960]   And that's the main reason we have one with you, Georgia, because you two, it's so fun
[00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:07.160]   to watch the clown car go off the rails on the rails off the rails.
[00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:08.160]   He's my Twitter wife.
[00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:09.960]   I only get to see her on Twitter.
[00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:16.160]   And I think we got a new unicorn here with a bird, a Baldwin.
[00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:18.360]   He's going to be, he's going to be part of the fam.
[00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:20.880]   It's great to have you all three of you back.
[00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:24.600]   Our show today brought to you by Uber for business.
[00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:28.560]   You know, Uber, of course, rides, Uber eats, delivers food.
[00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:33.760]   Uber for business is a great way to keep employees engaged, to keep customers happy,
[00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:36.680]   especially nowadays when face to face interaction is limited.
[00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:41.000]   If you're trying to find a way to stand out to your customers or make your employees feel
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:44.200]   extra valued, you got to know about Uber for business.
[00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:50.440]   Over 150,000 companies use Uber for business to improve customer and employee satisfaction.
[00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:54.680]   If you're having a hard time getting people, let's say to show up at that, that zoom staff
[00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:59.760]   meeting or stay engaged in virtual team meetings or events, you could use a voucher from Uber
[00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:05.200]   for business at 20 bucks to their personal Uber account so they can easily order meals
[00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:08.320]   through Uber Eats before the meeting say, you know, something like, Hey, we're going
[00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:09.320]   to have a team meeting.
[00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:13.440]   I'll buy you lunch and send them the voucher or I'll buy you coffee, send them a voucher.
[00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:16.760]   Want to make your customers love your business even more?
[00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:20.640]   Offer them a voucher for a free meal or ride when they make their first purchase or spend
[00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:23.920]   a certain amount or say, Hey, we want you to come to our store.
[00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:28.320]   Can I buy you a ride over here at a ride back with Uber for business?
[00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:32.800]   Immediately start delivering extra value to the people who matter most to your business
[00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:35.320]   right now vouchers are simple.
[00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:40.760]   It's either easy to send, easy for your customer or a colleague to redeem your business has
[00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:46.040]   total control over who gets them when they expire, what portion of the ride of the meal
[00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:48.840]   you want to cover vouchers.
[00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:53.920]   You will send them typically via email or text and then they can be redeemed by your
[00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:57.120]   customer or your employee with a single tap.
[00:40:57.120 --> 00:40:58.480]   And here's the best part.
[00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:02.360]   You don't pay for anything until they take the ride or buy the meal.
[00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:05.160]   You only pay for what they use right now for a limited time.
[00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:10.440]   You'll get a $50 voucher when you create your first vouchers campaign and spend $200.
[00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:14.000]   All you have to do is go to uber.com/twit to learn more.
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:23.320]   Great new way to use Uber for meals or rides for colleagues, employees, customers, uber.com/twit
[00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:26.320]   terms and conditions apply uber.com/twit.
[00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:27.920]   It's a really good idea.
[00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:33.480]   I know a lot of companies that use this and I think it's a really smart way to do it.
[00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:35.800]   So this is part of the problem Owen.
[00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:39.760]   As you point out that Twitter, even though they're doing all right, it's hard for them
[00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:43.680]   to make money partly because their CEO has so many other interests.
[00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:46.480]   He just bought title from Jay Z.
[00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:49.400]   So now, square just bought titles.
[00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:55.560]   So now he's got a payment company, a music company and Twitter he's trying to run.
[00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:58.680]   And meanwhile, he's out meditating or something.
[00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:00.920]   Growing his beard.
[00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:05.360]   One of the things they've floated but have not yet implemented is some sort of subscription.
[00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:09.000]   One of the things Jack Dorsey said is what if we charged you?
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   What if we had a store?
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:13.360]   Everybody's looking at Apple and how well they're doing with the app store.
[00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:21.760]   What if we had a store where you could buy a curated Twitter?
[00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:26.720]   Like you could say, I want a Twitter that's got a lot of philosophy on it or something
[00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:27.720]   like that.
[00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:32.000]   And then you pay five bucks and we've got this special filter for you.
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:38.000]   What would you pay for Twitter for, Owen, besides deleting everything you ever said?
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:45.200]   So Twitter is one of the only platforms that doesn't have a nudity clause.
[00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:50.520]   If I was Jack Dorsey, I would turn on only fans Twitter and I'd only take a 10% of things.
[00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:54.760]   And I would destroy them because most of the people that are on OnlyFans, OnlyFans has
[00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:58.000]   a thing where it tweets out a link because that again is the only platform.
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:42:59.440]   No one knows otherwise.
[00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:01.680]   So Twitter is the publicity side.
[00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:04.080]   Exactly because Twitter is the only one that allows you to use Unity.
[00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:06.680]   Tumblr doesn't do nudity more since it got bought by whoever.
[00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:08.680]   I can't remember.
[00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:12.680]   But Twitter is one of the most explicit adult content on there.
[00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:14.560]   So if I was them, that's exactly what I'd do.
[00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:16.920]   I'd be like, hey, here's your own little OnlyFans.
[00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:17.920]   You don't have to go outside of Twitter.
[00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:18.920]   You don't have to go anywhere for it.
[00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:20.800]   You know, we've got an explicit rating on it.
[00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:23.000]   So only people that come in and subscribe, you can get to it.
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:26.040]   Only people that have opted in would stay already have that.
[00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:29.040]   You have to hit a button to be able to see that kind of content.
[00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:31.200]   And I would only take a 10% VIG.
[00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:35.560]   They would make billions of dollars in the next quarter because everyone would like one
[00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:37.840]   stop shopping for that kind of content.
[00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:38.840]   And people trust Twitter.
[00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:41.640]   A lot of people don't use OnlyFans because you got to go give your credit cards to some
[00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:43.120]   company that you don't know.
[00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:44.600]   And again, they're taking 20% VIG.
[00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:47.120]   If you take 10%, you're in there like swimwear.
[00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:48.120]   Let's get that money printed.
[00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:50.120]   That would be my move.
[00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:51.120]   You know what?
[00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:52.920]   They have this other company called Square.
[00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:56.760]   They can help process your payment and then your payment comes through as Twitter, whatever.
[00:43:56.760 --> 00:44:01.840]   It doesn't come through as OnlyFans or Pornhub or whatever porn thing.
[00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:02.840]   Exactly.
[00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:05.400]   So you get the option of seeing the
[00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:12.040]   naked people doing the naked things that you like without the fear of someone else maybe
[00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:16.560]   in your family or finding out that you're looking at naked people doing naked things.
[00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:21.360]   And just so I don't get yelled at, there are also people that actually have cooking shows,
[00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:22.360]   sewing shows.
[00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:24.360]   OnlyFans is gone way beyond.
[00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:27.280]   I think it's not only naked people.
[00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:29.600]   It's not only naked people, but there are a lot of people.
[00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:33.520]   I know a lot of photographers that use it too and do like behind the scenes shoots and
[00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:35.280]   all their sayings and something like that.
[00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:37.280]   Just not to say it's not a naked people.
[00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:40.960]   Perhaps the best money generator, somebody in the chatroom suggesting they could rename
[00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:44.480]   it Twitties and it would be...
[00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:46.280]   That's funny.
[00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:48.280]   That's in Conway, too.
[00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:49.280]   We're bro going.
[00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:50.280]   We're bro going.
[00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:51.280]   We're bro going.
[00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:58.440]   Yeah, you have Patreon, you have all these different Twitch, you have all these different
[00:44:58.440 --> 00:45:04.760]   ways to sort of make money with subscribers and Twitter, you already have all the people
[00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:06.200]   right there.
[00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:10.520]   Everybody knows that basically the internet was invented for porn.
[00:45:10.520 --> 00:45:12.400]   Let's be frank.
[00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:15.320]   And the rest of it is just icing on the cake.
[00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:17.200]   I don't want to say it was invented for porn.
[00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:21.400]   I like to take the subscription that porn makes the internet better.
[00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:25.640]   Everything that you get bro going to do on the internet porn advances.
[00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:26.960]   You remember when you wanted HD?
[00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:27.960]   Oh, you got HD.
[00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:28.960]   Remember when you wanted 4K?
[00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:29.960]   You got...
[00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:30.960]   Yeah.
[00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:31.960]   Remember when you wanted 8K?
[00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:32.960]   What was the difference?
[00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:33.960]   Before.
[00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:34.960]   What was the difference?
[00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:40.120]   What was the difference between beta, cam, laser discs and VHS.
[00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:43.840]   Only one of those three platforms had adult content.
[00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:45.280]   Only one of them survived VHS.
[00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:46.280]   That's how it works.
[00:45:46.280 --> 00:45:47.280]   Yeah.
[00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:48.280]   That's what they do.
[00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:49.280]   They advance technology, baby.
[00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:52.720]   Do you think that these cars would be electric and hands-free driving if people weren't in
[00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:54.280]   car trying to do stuff?
[00:45:54.280 --> 00:45:55.520]   And free?
[00:45:55.520 --> 00:46:00.240]   Are guys just pathetic slaves to their desires?
[00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:01.240]   Is that the truth?
[00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:03.240]   I think that we all are.
[00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:04.240]   Oh, really?
[00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:06.840]   And I don't think that men and women...
[00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:08.880]   Again, it doesn't have to be sexual desires.
[00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:10.440]   It can be all kinds of stuff.
[00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:11.440]   It's money.
[00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:12.440]   Yeah.
[00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:13.440]   Good food.
[00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:14.440]   A fine cigar.
[00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:15.440]   All kinds of stuff that were there.
[00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:18.360]   But I think that if you're going to have this, you have to have a feature where your tweets
[00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:22.000]   and what you do on Twitter is you have the chance to have it deleted.
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:25.160]   Again, if someone else is copying your famous person, oh well.
[00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:27.480]   But at least you could have it deleted forever.
[00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:29.960]   Wiped, clean off their servers, off everything.
[00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:32.680]   There is software, third party software that will do that.
[00:46:32.680 --> 00:46:38.640]   I actually, when I left Twitter, took the trouble of going through the process of deleting
[00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:39.640]   old tweets.
[00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:41.480]   If you already had it, right?
[00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:43.120]   If you already had it, it would set up.
[00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:46.840]   Especially if you end up having whatever nudity or something else that's on there.
[00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:47.840]   But let's just say it.
[00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:49.960]   Like, we have a right to be able to be forgotten.
[00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:52.920]   I think that that should be one of our innate rights.
[00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:58.000]   And if they had that, I think that it would be something that I think a lot of people would
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:46:59.840]   find it worth paying money for.
[00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:04.280]   Especially when you watch people suddenly have all of these horrible things happen for
[00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:06.800]   tweets that happened a decade or longer ago.
[00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:11.680]   Because the API is rate limited on Twitter, I think I could only delete a chunk of tweets
[00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:12.680]   at a time.
[00:47:12.680 --> 00:47:13.680]   So I had to keep running.
[00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:15.880]   And I don't think it deleted all the tweets.
[00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:16.880]   And it's an API.
[00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:17.880]   Tweet Twitter.
[00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:18.880]   That should be a Twitter.
[00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:21.800]   You're saying that should be a feature.
[00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:26.600]   I can't be allowed to say, after a month, delete them.
[00:47:26.600 --> 00:47:32.040]   Everything that's before March of 2020, get rid of it.
[00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:33.040]   I don't need it.
[00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:34.040]   I'm not going back to it.
[00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:39.160]   I feel bad for all the publications that have embedded my tweets for whatever reason.
[00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:41.760]   But I should have done a screen grab.
[00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:45.120]   They should have paid you and how do you do something?
[00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:49.600]   I think though that's why Twitter doesn't do this because I think philosophically they
[00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:53.880]   have some investment, not only they have this investment in the free speech wing of the
[00:47:53.880 --> 00:47:57.600]   free speech party, which that's been tarnished a little bit.
[00:47:57.600 --> 00:48:03.400]   But I think they also have this investment in the idea that it lasts forever.
[00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:06.960]   It's a record of your life.
[00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:12.400]   Although I see there's a company called TweetDeleader, which charges $3.99.
[00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:15.800]   So there is money to be made in deleting your tweets.
[00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:16.800]   Right?
[00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:23.880]   Yeah, if they want to be the tech company of record, then that's fine.
[00:48:23.880 --> 00:48:26.560]   But that should be up to the individual, the individual account.
[00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:31.800]   I shouldn't be held hostage by Twitter because something, a bad joke I tweeted a long time
[00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:32.800]   ago.
[00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:33.800]   I completely agree.
[00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:34.800]   It's not offensive.
[00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:35.800]   It's just really, really bad.
[00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:37.600]   Actually, I take it back.
[00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:39.080]   So look at this.
[00:48:39.080 --> 00:48:42.640]   It's $3.99 a month for up to 500 tweets a month.
[00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:48.960]   $3.99 for 3,200 tweets and 1,000 likes per month to delete or delete all your tweets and
[00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:52.080]   likes for a mere $6 a month.
[00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:53.080]   That's nothing.
[00:48:53.080 --> 00:48:56.880]   Yeah, it feels like you'd use this for one month and you'd be done.
[00:48:56.880 --> 00:48:58.320]   Yeah, I feel like a week.
[00:48:58.320 --> 00:49:02.520]   And then go back to the $3.99 one every, you know, every few months and delete the old
[00:49:02.520 --> 00:49:03.520]   stuff.
[00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:04.760]   I think it's not a bad idea.
[00:49:04.760 --> 00:49:09.840]   Kids, you don't know, you know, you might have said something a couple of years ago that
[00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:13.080]   was okay then, may even be okay now that won't be okay in 10 years.
[00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:14.080]   Who knows?
[00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:18.600]   And side note, just for parents and kids like my daughter did recently tell me when
[00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:23.000]   she first like got into Twitter and realized the power of Twitter, she was contacting a
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:26.160]   lot of her like fan boy people that she liked on YouTube.
[00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:33.280]   It's like like I was being like a simp and gushy and I wish that I could delete the DMs
[00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:36.320]   that I was sending them because she can bleed on her end.
[00:49:36.320 --> 00:49:38.840]   But that doesn't mean anything because it's still on their end.
[00:49:38.840 --> 00:49:41.120]   So they had to be careful.
[00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:42.120]   That's a good point.
[00:49:42.120 --> 00:49:46.920]   In fact, that's exactly what happened to this former editor of Teen Vogue.
[00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:50.720]   She had deleted them, but somebody saved them and then really close.
[00:49:50.720 --> 00:49:54.520]   And especially in private messages, that's what I mean like in private messages, unless
[00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:58.920]   your Mark Zuckerberg, I know Pudev had conversations with him on Facebook and somehow he deletes
[00:49:58.920 --> 00:50:02.440]   the whole record on your side and his side because you know, he's running a show over
[00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:03.440]   there.
[00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:06.040]   Well, when, yeah, when you run, when you run the system, you can make all kinds of changes
[00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:07.040]   that you want to.
[00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:08.640]   But it shows how important it is.
[00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:10.200]   If he's planning to do it, right?
[00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:13.280]   Like whenever I see tech people and they're like taping up their cameras and I'm like,
[00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:18.440]   Oh, OK, well, if Zuckerberg has tape on his cameras, I'm like, OK, there.
[00:50:18.440 --> 00:50:20.080]   Yeah, like he knows.
[00:50:20.080 --> 00:50:20.920]   Yeah.
[00:50:20.920 --> 00:50:21.920]   Yeah.
[00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:22.680]   No.
[00:50:22.680 --> 00:50:23.840]   It's a sign.
[00:50:23.840 --> 00:50:27.440]   We just have to wait until something happens with one of Jack's old tweets and they have
[00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:29.440]   to delete it and then they'll like, oh, we got it.
[00:50:29.440 --> 00:50:30.360]   We're going to make this.
[00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:34.000]   You saw when they were you saw he's selling his first tweet.
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:36.640]   Let me just check and see how much it's worse.
[00:50:36.640 --> 00:50:38.560]   We're not we're not talking about NFTs today.
[00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:40.240]   I don't feel like talking about skating stuff.
[00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:44.200]   Can we can we talk about a subject and use robbers intellect?
[00:50:44.200 --> 00:50:46.760]   I want to talk about what I want to get to the auto section.
[00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:49.840]   I want to look at this ugly ugly BMW i4.
[00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:51.440]   It is a true limit, though.
[00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:58.280]   I think today today is the last day to buy Jack Dorsey's first tweet.
[00:50:58.280 --> 00:51:01.040]   How I don't believe it ends today.
[00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:03.640]   Let's just see what let's just see what the bidding is up to.
[00:51:03.640 --> 00:51:04.920]   It's a billion.
[00:51:04.920 --> 00:51:06.760]   It's been frozen at two and a half million.
[00:51:06.760 --> 00:51:08.160]   Nobody seems to want it for more.
[00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:09.720]   See there you go.
[00:51:09.720 --> 00:51:10.320]   Yeah.
[00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:11.480]   Yeah, one half million.
[00:51:11.480 --> 00:51:12.160]   How much is playing?
[00:51:12.160 --> 00:51:13.120]   How much should I offer?
[00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:16.080]   Should I offer two point dollars?
[00:51:16.080 --> 00:51:20.400]   Yeah, see what happens if I ever $25.
[00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:23.040]   You're going to get a F1IA.
[00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:30.120]   That's so this is a good example of why NFTs are are oddball because obviously there was at
[00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:33.800]   some time up through March 6th, this feeling like this is going to be worth a lot.
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:38.640]   And then all of a sudden everybody went, oh, and this poor guy, Sina Estavi,
[00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:44.440]   is sitting at the top there thinking, please Leo bid 2.8 million.
[00:51:44.440 --> 00:51:45.520]   Please.
[00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:48.800]   Now, what what do you get if you buy this?
[00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:52.200]   You see what you get the right to say I own this tweet.
[00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:55.720]   That's it.
[00:51:55.720 --> 00:51:57.120]   Sorry, I'm in shock.
[00:51:57.120 --> 00:51:58.760]   I'm like, oh, this is NFTs.
[00:51:58.760 --> 00:52:00.920]   That's why nobody wants to talk about this anymore.
[00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:03.240]   And then FTS aren't a problem.
[00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:07.080]   If you have money and you find value in something, then it's valuable.
[00:52:07.080 --> 00:52:11.720]   You know, if you if you go to the shore every year and click rocks with your child
[00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:14.920]   and your child dies at the age of six, those rocks are priceless.
[00:52:14.920 --> 00:52:15.920]   Oh, yeah, of course.
[00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:16.280]   Yeah.
[00:52:16.280 --> 00:52:20.480]   What would you pay to get one of those rocks if your house is broken into and you were stolen?
[00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:21.640]   You might pay anything.
[00:52:21.640 --> 00:52:23.880]   So there's always value and relativity to it.
[00:52:23.880 --> 00:52:25.520]   And I fully and won't board NFTs.
[00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:28.920]   I'm actually secretly selling NFTs or some of my art friends, but I don't like talking about it
[00:52:28.920 --> 00:52:32.200]   because as much as it's a scam, it's reality because that's how art works.
[00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:35.120]   Why do you buy something at $50 and 20 years later?
[00:52:35.120 --> 00:52:36.240]   The guy's not Van Gogh.
[00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:37.800]   Why is it value to the 100,000?
[00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:38.400]   I don't know.
[00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:40.080]   Cause some rich person thinks they want to buy it.
[00:52:40.080 --> 00:52:44.920]   You know, this is this was a good article though this week in the New York Times.
[00:52:44.920 --> 00:52:48.680]   Here's how board rich people are spending their extra cash.
[00:52:48.680 --> 00:52:57.280]   And by the way, maybe that's how board rich Roberto Baldwin had spent his extra cash on a 1973 Porsche
[00:52:57.280 --> 00:52:59.600]   Carrera 911 RS.
[00:53:00.080 --> 00:53:02.280]   I don't know how rich yes, but I'm not so.
[00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:04.800]   Do you want to know how much that's selling for right now?
[00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:06.000]   I don't want to know.
[00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:14.160]   It's the the the the auction, like bring a trailer, bring a trailer has just sort of
[00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:15.120]   that's who's selling it.
[00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:16.680]   Crazy.
[00:53:16.680 --> 00:53:21.240]   They have they have they have they're not manipulating the market because they've created this hype
[00:53:21.240 --> 00:53:27.720]   around the used automotive market and it's things are just going for so much.
[00:53:27.720 --> 00:53:33.240]   Anything from the 90s right now, all the Gen X cars, all the civics, all the CRXs, all the Nissan
[00:53:33.240 --> 00:53:39.800]   Centros, which I can't even I can't even go on the site because it's it's it's sort of infuriating
[00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:48.600]   that I didn't keep my 90 that I sold my 90, 90 Honda Civic DH hats back to my friend for $300
[00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:50.000]   because he was in dire straits.
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:51.800]   Is it was it mint though?
[00:53:51.800 --> 00:53:52.640]   That's the question.
[00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:54.120]   It wasn't mint.
[00:53:54.120 --> 00:53:55.600]   But I couldn't even be bothered.
[00:53:55.600 --> 00:53:58.200]   You know, I could restore it and then turn on it.
[00:53:58.200 --> 00:54:01.120]   So the asking price I might as well tell you this is on bat.
[00:54:01.120 --> 00:54:09.320]   Bring a trailer for a 1973 Porsche 911 Carrera RS, the asking price $1.2 million right now.
[00:54:09.320 --> 00:54:10.480]   Never mind.
[00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:11.080]   I wouldn't buy that.
[00:54:11.080 --> 00:54:14.320]   Yeah, I just I can't I can't in my brain.
[00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:15.760]   It doesn't matter how much money I have.
[00:54:15.760 --> 00:54:18.400]   I can't buy something that I won't feel comfortable driving.
[00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:19.400]   The point yeah, well, that's right.
[00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:20.160]   You can't drive it.
[00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:23.760]   The point the New York Times makes, though, is before the pandemic, it was selling for
[00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:25.040]   560,000.
[00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:26.560]   So it's doubled.
[00:54:26.560 --> 00:54:31.480]   And that's because apparently there are a lot of wealthy people who haven't been
[00:54:31.480 --> 00:54:34.880]   spending money on travel or dining out or whatever it is, rich people buy.
[00:54:34.880 --> 00:54:40.360]   So they've got all this income and they can't so they're buying things like this coffee table.
[00:54:40.360 --> 00:54:43.160]   That's a beautiful.
[00:54:43.160 --> 00:54:49.760]   I mean, it's a gorgeous coffee table, but it's selling for let's see.
[00:54:50.320 --> 00:54:53.560]   $2.5 million.
[00:54:53.560 --> 00:54:56.960]   It's a made out of is it made out of like Abraham Lincoln's bones?
[00:54:56.960 --> 00:54:58.120]   What is it made out of?
[00:54:58.120 --> 00:55:03.600]   Of course, we talked last week about the biggest of all, which is the NFT for a
[00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:08.920]   people work, a JPEG, which sold for $69.3 million at Christie's last week.
[00:55:08.920 --> 00:55:11.680]   I love marketing so much.
[00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:14.680]   Marketing is like my favorite thing in the whole universe in the world.
[00:55:14.680 --> 00:55:17.840]   Like the only reason we buy diamonds is because of marketing.
[00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:18.200]   Yes.
[00:55:18.200 --> 00:55:23.000]   They told you 50 years that brown diamonds were dirty, ugly things and nobody wanted
[00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:23.000]   it.
[00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:27.000]   Then they turned them into chocolate diamonds and you just buy them like the fact that
[00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:29.960]   they're spending $2 million on a table.
[00:55:29.960 --> 00:55:35.080]   It makes me those chocolate diamonds I bought are just brown dirty diamonds.
[00:55:35.080 --> 00:55:38.400]   They're diamonds that nobody wanted for 40 for 40 years.
[00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:41.840]   Little guys in the Congo were throwing them down the river because nobody could do
[00:55:41.840 --> 00:55:46.080]   anything with them, but then somebody smart in a room said chocolate diamonds.
[00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:47.200]   And now we have chocolate.
[00:55:48.120 --> 00:55:50.120]   The thing you could get rich people to do what you want.
[00:55:50.120 --> 00:55:52.880]   My favorite con was you fell prey to this on Leo.
[00:55:52.880 --> 00:55:54.480]   You're just rich enough to fall for this stuff.
[00:55:54.480 --> 00:55:59.360]   Four years ago, I remember this great article that said when you're wealthy,
[00:55:59.360 --> 00:56:02.160]   acquiring items isn't the thing to do.
[00:56:02.160 --> 00:56:02.400]   Yes.
[00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:02.920]   Travel.
[00:56:02.920 --> 00:56:04.760]   It's experiences.
[00:56:04.760 --> 00:56:05.080]   Yes.
[00:56:05.080 --> 00:56:06.320]   You have to experience.
[00:56:06.320 --> 00:56:07.280]   Experience.
[00:56:07.280 --> 00:56:10.080]   You have to sit the water from the Congo on the East shore.
[00:56:10.080 --> 00:56:12.760]   The problem with that is you never own it.
[00:56:12.760 --> 00:56:13.720]   You got to keep buying it.
[00:56:13.720 --> 00:56:17.600]   You got to spend and spend and spend because you can never have
[00:56:18.160 --> 00:56:20.480]   you can ever have too many experiences.
[00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:21.480]   Exactly.
[00:56:21.480 --> 00:56:22.560]   That's good money.
[00:56:22.560 --> 00:56:24.880]   But then you can't have the experience.
[00:56:24.880 --> 00:56:29.560]   You need a $4.5 million coffee table made out of oak wood from the shores.
[00:56:29.560 --> 00:56:32.240]   It's a good looking coffee table though.
[00:56:32.240 --> 00:56:34.200]   We let's look at this car.
[00:56:34.200 --> 00:56:35.680]   We got Rob on here for a reason.
[00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:36.720]   We need his expertise.
[00:56:36.720 --> 00:56:37.800]   All right.
[00:56:37.800 --> 00:56:38.640]   Look at the four.
[00:56:38.640 --> 00:56:39.920]   Yes.
[00:56:39.920 --> 00:56:40.920]   The track.
[00:56:40.920 --> 00:56:41.920]   I don't know anything about cars.
[00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:42.920]   I'll show you.
[00:56:42.920 --> 00:56:44.000]   Why should I hate this?
[00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:45.600]   So what car?
[00:56:45.600 --> 00:56:46.640]   I'll wait for it.
[00:56:46.640 --> 00:56:47.640]   Tell me the car.
[00:56:47.640 --> 00:56:48.720]   The eyes.
[00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:50.040]   Oh, the new BMW?
[00:56:50.040 --> 00:56:51.160]   Yes.
[00:56:51.160 --> 00:56:52.960]   530 horsepower.
[00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:54.200]   300 mile range.
[00:56:54.200 --> 00:56:55.840]   Now this is a concept car though.
[00:56:55.840 --> 00:56:56.960]   Let's be honest, right?
[00:56:56.960 --> 00:56:58.440]   No, this is the production vehicle.
[00:56:58.440 --> 00:56:59.880]   OK.
[00:56:59.880 --> 00:57:01.840]   This is the production because they've shown the concept before.
[00:57:01.840 --> 00:57:02.640]   That looks nice.
[00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:03.640]   What's ugly about that?
[00:57:03.640 --> 00:57:04.320]   That looks all right.
[00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:05.400]   It's like no, no, no, no.
[00:57:05.400 --> 00:57:06.920]   No, keep going down.
[00:57:06.920 --> 00:57:07.760]   Keep going down.
[00:57:07.760 --> 00:57:09.520]   Is it is it the grill?
[00:57:09.520 --> 00:57:11.040]   Yeah, the grill.
[00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:11.840]   Look at the grill.
[00:57:11.840 --> 00:57:14.480]   Oh, like a little tea.
[00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:18.200]   Looks like the price of the car and what it's supposed to do.
[00:57:18.200 --> 00:57:20.360]   That is an ugly BMW.
[00:57:20.360 --> 00:57:23.720]   Oh, that's weird.
[00:57:23.720 --> 00:57:25.720]   Got a weird buck teeth.
[00:57:25.720 --> 00:57:27.880]   And it's got the worst rims in America.
[00:57:27.880 --> 00:57:29.520]   Like, let me look at the rims.
[00:57:29.520 --> 00:57:30.440]   I didn't see the rims.
[00:57:30.440 --> 00:57:31.240]   Wow.
[00:57:31.240 --> 00:57:31.760]   Oh, yeah.
[00:57:31.760 --> 00:57:33.000]   ugly thing.
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:33.800]   Yeah.
[00:57:33.800 --> 00:57:34.640]   Yeah, that's not so.
[00:57:34.640 --> 00:57:35.560]   Yeah.
[00:57:35.560 --> 00:57:37.360]   They're probably charged an arm and a leg for this thing.
[00:57:37.360 --> 00:57:40.000]   Oh, it's like it's like it.
[00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:41.520]   Yeah, that that grill.
[00:57:41.520 --> 00:57:43.320]   It's like it's electric though.
[00:57:43.320 --> 00:57:44.640]   So it's like that's nice.
[00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:47.280]   But it looks like it hit the butt of another car because it has a little
[00:57:47.280 --> 00:57:50.920]   butt imprint on the grill is like, I don't know.
[00:57:50.920 --> 00:57:54.640]   You're saying, wait a minute, you're saying those those two things look like
[00:57:54.640 --> 00:57:55.760]   somebody's buttocks.
[00:57:55.760 --> 00:57:57.480]   They do like I but she's that is.
[00:57:57.480 --> 00:58:00.200]   They kind of somebody with a lot of weight.
[00:58:00.200 --> 00:58:01.520]   We're going to have to put it down.
[00:58:01.520 --> 00:58:02.520]   I got to have them.
[00:58:02.520 --> 00:58:03.560]   But I know what those are.
[00:58:03.560 --> 00:58:07.160]   I have to put an adult tag on this particular episode.
[00:58:07.160 --> 00:58:08.520]   I'm friends.
[00:58:08.520 --> 00:58:11.440]   Yeah, it does look like a but print on your side.
[00:58:11.440 --> 00:58:12.440]   I don't know.
[00:58:12.440 --> 00:58:13.760]   I can't see it.
[00:58:13.760 --> 00:58:14.760]   You can't see it.
[00:58:14.760 --> 00:58:15.760]   Thank you, Georgie.
[00:58:15.760 --> 00:58:17.160]   You saved me a lot of money.
[00:58:17.160 --> 00:58:18.640]   No, no, I'm headlight.
[00:58:18.640 --> 00:58:19.880]   So nice thing about it.
[00:58:19.880 --> 00:58:21.600]   I'm just happy everybody's getting to watch it.
[00:58:21.600 --> 00:58:23.520]   They're they're they're nice.
[00:58:23.520 --> 00:58:24.760]   I like it's good.
[00:58:24.760 --> 00:58:30.320]   So so BMW came out with this this larger and larger grill design and
[00:58:30.320 --> 00:58:33.360]   almost universally people do not like it.
[00:58:33.360 --> 00:58:35.920]   But BMW is like, Nope, we're going to just keep doing it.
[00:58:35.920 --> 00:58:37.400]   They have not backed down.
[00:58:37.400 --> 00:58:40.760]   I remember they were just like, we're just going to keep going.
[00:58:40.760 --> 00:58:42.040]   Nothing you can do about it.
[00:58:42.040 --> 00:58:43.040]   We're running with it.
[00:58:43.040 --> 00:58:44.040]   We're running with it.
[00:58:44.040 --> 00:58:44.640]   Anyway, and you know what?
[00:58:44.640 --> 00:58:45.480]   You're in the car.
[00:58:45.480 --> 00:58:46.680]   You don't have to see the outside.
[00:58:46.680 --> 00:58:49.240]   That's why you're buying the car.
[00:58:49.240 --> 00:58:51.160]   So everyone else can see the outside.
[00:58:51.160 --> 00:58:52.880]   What's a BMW?
[00:58:52.880 --> 00:58:54.080]   So you buy in the car.
[00:58:54.080 --> 00:58:54.440]   Right.
[00:58:54.440 --> 00:58:56.240]   For the name, because it's a BMW.
[00:58:56.240 --> 00:58:57.680]   It's like Mercedes.
[00:58:57.680 --> 00:58:59.800]   Some people don't buy these cars because they're good cars.
[00:58:59.800 --> 00:59:05.800]   They buy them because they have, you know, the of a German luxury sedan.
[00:59:05.800 --> 00:59:08.720]   And it's you get inside the beam.
[00:59:08.720 --> 00:59:09.680]   They'll be like, Oh, this is great.
[00:59:09.680 --> 00:59:12.600]   But you know that that the yeah, the grill is.
[00:59:12.600 --> 00:59:14.040]   Have you seen the latest?
[00:59:14.040 --> 00:59:16.320]   This is the new BMW seven series grill.
[00:59:16.320 --> 00:59:20.440]   It's basically all grill.
[00:59:20.440 --> 00:59:22.000]   All right.
[00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:24.200]   That's from GT board.com.
[00:59:24.200 --> 00:59:26.160]   That looks kind of cool, though.
[00:59:26.160 --> 00:59:26.800]   You see?
[00:59:26.800 --> 00:59:27.920]   Would you would you run out?
[00:59:27.920 --> 00:59:29.240]   Would you run out and get that?
[00:59:29.240 --> 00:59:31.280]   I probably wouldn't.
[00:59:31.280 --> 00:59:33.320]   But I would look if someone else was driving it.
[00:59:33.320 --> 00:59:37.200]   I mean, that's that's the point is that these BMW girls have gotten
[00:59:37.200 --> 00:59:39.520]   so so ugly.
[00:59:39.520 --> 00:59:43.280]   That over time, these guys are having some fun with it.
[00:59:43.280 --> 00:59:47.720]   That's going to just get bigger and bigger and bigger.
[00:59:47.720 --> 00:59:52.320]   I mean, I actually shouldn't be making fun of this car because at some point,
[00:59:52.320 --> 00:59:53.760]   I got to see Dennis about this gap.
[00:59:53.760 --> 00:59:55.480]   I might have some big teeth put in place.
[00:59:55.480 --> 00:59:57.040]   So they might be pulling up.
[00:59:57.040 --> 00:59:59.800]   I have a I have a BMW.
[00:59:59.800 --> 01:00:01.200]   Here's a baby.
[01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:04.440]   You say an O and JJ Stone baby picture and yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:05.480]   Yeah, that's him. Yeah.
[01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:06.480]   That's the other one.
[01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:08.200]   That's the little baby.
[01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:09.200]   That's the most.
[01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:11.160]   All right, I'm stopping.
[01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:12.120]   I'm stopping now.
[01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:12.600]   That's it.
[01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:13.600]   We're going to.
[01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:16.000]   Yeah, Ellen, you were totally right, by the way.
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.200]   Yeah, I was right.
[01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:19.080]   What did he predict?
[01:00:19.080 --> 01:00:20.840]   About this.
[01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:21.840]   Yeah.
[01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:28.000]   Yeah, it's it's it's difficult because they're they're going to be, you know,
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:32.160]   competing against the Model S, which people have gotten used to that design.
[01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:37.400]   They're going to be competing with the e-tron GT, which is a beautiful car.
[01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:38.400]   I love that.
[01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:41.880]   The Lucid Air that's coming out the Porsche Taycan, which is a nice looking car.
[01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:46.560]   You know, it's it's more of a sedan than those vehicles, but you know, it's it's
[01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:49.120]   going to be up there for a long time of buyers.
[01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:52.720]   Electric vehicles were just the ugliest vehicles in the world for some reason.
[01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:56.000]   They didn't want to say they didn't want to sell.
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:00.560]   They just had to they just had to they had to make it in order to to meet compliance.
[01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:04.200]   Like the the president, Fiat at one point was saying, we don't like this.
[01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:06.760]   We don't want to make any more of these Fiat 500s.
[01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:09.640]   The Fiat 500 is the best Fiat that they've ever.
[01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:15.000]   Well, at least in the last 15, 20 years, it's probably the best Fiat, but not the best
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.440]   looking, not the best looking Fiat.
[01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:21.360]   But it was still, you know, well, I mean, it's looks better than than any of their
[01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:22.400]   little SUV things.
[01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:27.400]   So it was just a Fiat 500 that have electric electric powertrain and some
[01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:28.240]   batteries in the back.
[01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:28.600]   Right.
[01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:29.560]   And it was it was great.
[01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:31.200]   It drove better than the regular Fiat.
[01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:31.800]   Isn't that funny?
[01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:33.640]   It never it never broke.
[01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:34.640]   Yeah.
[01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:35.160]   Yeah.
[01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:36.160]   Never broke.
[01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:40.160]   Which is I mean, you saw the you know, you saw Fiat issues with the interior
[01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:41.680]   kind of falling apart with 500.
[01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:45.160]   The Fiat 500 is a wonderful disposable car.
[01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:48.880]   We leased one for three years because the lease was like $120 a month.
[01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:50.040]   I actually wanted one.
[01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:51.280]   I thought they were kind of cute.
[01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:52.840]   They kind of are fun.
[01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:56.200]   A lot of like the mini, you know, it's cute too.
[01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:56.880]   I like the mini.
[01:01:56.880 --> 01:01:57.440]   Yeah.
[01:01:57.440 --> 01:02:00.160]   But it was it felt like it was disposable.
[01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:01.640]   Yeah, I have it.
[01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:04.640]   It's the Mustang Mach-E, but it's not a Mustang.
[01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:07.680]   But does it have like the auto drive stuff?
[01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:08.200]   Yes.
[01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:09.440]   Well, that's the funny thing.
[01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:14.560]   They say they're going to ship that later this year as a upgrade.
[01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:18.000]   And it'll be free for existing owners and then be some price.
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:21.920]   But honestly, it does most of the self driving stuff that Tesla labels
[01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:22.960]   audio pilot already.
[01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:24.400]   It has adaptive cruise control.
[01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:27.680]   So it slows down when the vehicle in front of you slows down comes to a
[01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:28.040]   stop.
[01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:30.160]   If it comes to a stop, starts up again.
[01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:32.360]   If it starts moving, so it's perfect for stop and go.
[01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:36.440]   It has lane keeping, so it will steer you through curves on a lane.
[01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:39.880]   There's only a couple of things it's missing from Tesla.
[01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:41.680]   Five year old Honda has that on.
[01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:42.840]   That's not impressive.
[01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:46.760]   Are you claim it was impressive?
[01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:47.960]   You just asked me.
[01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:51.040]   I did ask you, but to where you just eloquently just you.
[01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:55.280]   Burberryated all that basic old technology.
[01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:56.400]   You made it sound too sexy.
[01:02:56.400 --> 01:02:59.480]   I'm a little regular old basic cruise control nowadays.
[01:02:59.480 --> 01:02:59.880]   OK.
[01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:04.640]   All right, I've had that for five years, you know, Lane says, and I want my car
[01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:08.600]   to pick me up at the grocery store when I walk out the door on Tuesday.
[01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:13.760]   If I had that summon thing where you press a button in it, no, comes to you.
[01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:15.760]   I never it has it in three years.
[01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:17.680]   I never tried it because I was terrified.
[01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:19.600]   Because I'm right into something.
[01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:20.560]   Yeah.
[01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:21.960]   It's what I'm talking about.
[01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:25.120]   Rich people buy stuff and then no use it.
[01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:27.840]   You don't deserve to have a car to come pick you up at the corner because
[01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:28.760]   what are you not using?
[01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:31.760]   I want to have a car to come and get a car to come.
[01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:34.240]   You're going to get a car to come and get a car to come.
[01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:34.240]   Let me verbate for a moment.
[01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:37.560]   OK, if you don't want to tell you why he shouldn't have used it because it doesn't
[01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:37.760]   work.
[01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:38.880]   It runs in the crap.
[01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:39.280]   Yeah.
[01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:44.320]   It runs in the price of failure is very hot.
[01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:44.720]   That's a good thing.
[01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:47.400]   It's not like, oh, my computer crashed or my phone.
[01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:48.000]   This is something.
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:48.680]   But it crashed.
[01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:51.280]   It's very low speed, but it crashed.
[01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:57.840]   Scray along the side of the very low speed crash or it hits somebody.
[01:03:57.840 --> 01:03:59.040]   That's not good.
[01:03:59.040 --> 01:03:59.520]   It knocked.
[01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:01.400]   It only knocked the older man down.
[01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:02.840]   It didn't throw in my screen.
[01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:04.240]   It's a little blurry.
[01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:05.040]   I can't see it.
[01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:06.000]   But I can't see it.
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:06.840]   Yeah.
[01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:06.840]   Yeah.
[01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:07.920]   OK.
[01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:08.760]   What are we looking at?
[01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:09.920]   We're looking at what is that?
[01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:13.880]   We're looking at somebody's Tesla driving stuff from a parking and then
[01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:16.600]   come pick him up at the corner and he does it every day.
[01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:17.880]   I can't really focus.
[01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:18.200]   Really?
[01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:19.520]   This guy does this every day.
[01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:20.560]   Oh, that's cool.
[01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:21.080]   Are there any cars that you want?
[01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:23.200]   Do you know this guy or is this some guy on Reddit?
[01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:24.560]   My friend's suffering Krause.
[01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:26.280]   He lives in San Diego, California.
[01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:30.040]   And I'm upset with the fact that he has his car come picking him and his family up.
[01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:32.040]   You know what I never also never used it.
[01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:32.800]   I know it works.
[01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:33.640]   So slow.
[01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:36.200]   Yeah, that's why it's going very slow.
[01:04:36.200 --> 01:04:39.040]   You could walk that fast to get to it.
[01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:41.240]   When you're rich, wow, George.
[01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:43.240]   I'm sorry.
[01:04:43.240 --> 01:04:44.240]   I'm sorry.
[01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:45.240]   I'm sorry.
[01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:46.240]   I'm sorry.
[01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:47.240]   Come on.
[01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:49.080]   Now you're walking.
[01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:51.080]   You're not bidding on a queen.
[01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:54.480]   You're not bidding on 9/11.
[01:04:55.680 --> 01:04:57.680]   All you're going to do is do is do.
[01:04:57.680 --> 01:04:58.680]   True.
[01:04:58.680 --> 01:04:59.680]   True.
[01:04:59.680 --> 01:05:00.680]   Right.
[01:05:00.680 --> 01:05:01.680]   On amazing things.
[01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:02.680]   Right.
[01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:03.680]   Okay.
[01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:04.680]   Fair, I should be.
[01:05:04.680 --> 01:05:05.680]   I don't like Uncle Leo's 7-1 to this world.
[01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:06.680]   I believe.
[01:05:06.680 --> 01:05:07.680]   Okay.
[01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:11.280]   This is why we spend the money and whether he used it or not, he's wasting his power.
[01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:12.480]   Lord, all that response.
[01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:13.480]   What Uncle Ben says?
[01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:14.480]   He's wasting his powers.
[01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:17.280]   With great responsibility comes great technology.
[01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:18.480]   He said something like that.
[01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:19.480]   I'm like that.
[01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:20.480]   Uncle Ben, this is the rice guy.
[01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:21.480]   What are you talking about?
[01:05:21.480 --> 01:05:22.480]   No, I'm a man.
[01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:23.480]   Spiderman.
[01:05:23.480 --> 01:05:24.480]   Spiderman.
[01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:25.480]   Spiderman.
[01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:26.480]   Spiderman.
[01:05:26.480 --> 01:05:27.480]   Spiderman.
[01:05:27.480 --> 01:05:28.480]   Spiderman.
[01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:29.480]   Spiderman.
[01:05:29.480 --> 01:05:30.480]   Yes.
[01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:31.480]   Alright.
[01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:32.480]   I like the Spiderman sound effects.
[01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:33.480]   Can you do that again?
[01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:34.480]   You got to do that.
[01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:35.480]   You got to do that.
[01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:36.480]   You got to do that.
[01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:38.480]   You got to do the Spiderman finger gestures.
[01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:39.480]   Thank you.
[01:05:39.480 --> 01:05:40.480]   That's my name.
[01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:41.480]   Sometimes they come out of his skin.
[01:05:41.480 --> 01:05:45.880]   Sometimes he has like little things that he wears that he built in, I don't know, math class.
[01:05:45.880 --> 01:05:46.880]   I don't.
[01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:47.880]   Yes.
[01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:54.880]   I love it.
[01:05:54.880 --> 01:06:01.880]   O and J. J. Stone.
[01:06:01.880 --> 01:06:05.880]   Oh, doctor always stir and stuff up.
[01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:06.880]   IQMZ.com.
[01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:07.880]   Georgia Dow.
[01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:08.880]   We love her.
[01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:09.880]   YouTube.com/GeorgiaDow.
[01:06:09.880 --> 01:06:17.680]   And of course the return of one of my dearest, favoriteist guys, Roberta Baldwin.
[01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:20.680]   Back now that he's out of work, he joins us.
[01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:21.680]   Automotive detector.
[01:06:21.680 --> 01:06:24.680]   Got nothing but time.
[01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:32.680]   Actually, I think your concert may be potentially coming up in San Francisco in July or August.
[01:06:32.680 --> 01:06:35.320]   August 14th is a tentative date.
[01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:39.200]   We haven't announced anything yet because, you know, we start those.
[01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:42.680]   I think it may be the first live music I will have seen in a year and a half.
[01:06:42.680 --> 01:06:43.680]   I'm really excited.
[01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:44.680]   Yeah.
[01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:45.680]   Yeah.
[01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:46.680]   It'll be the first show that I've done since March.
[01:06:46.680 --> 01:06:47.680]   Yeah.
[01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:48.680]   2019.
[01:06:48.680 --> 01:06:49.680]   I don't know.
[01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:50.680]   Of March.
[01:06:50.680 --> 01:06:52.680]   We did a show in March of 2020.
[01:06:52.680 --> 01:06:53.680]   Yeah.
[01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:57.680]   Like right at the beginning and we hugged people afterwards and I think about that every day.
[01:06:57.680 --> 01:06:58.680]   Yes.
[01:06:58.680 --> 01:07:00.680]   We're thinking we hugged people.
[01:07:00.680 --> 01:07:02.680]   I am dying to see a live show.
[01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:06.960]   We were going to go see an unfreeze McGee live show that, you know, like the weekend after
[01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:11.080]   they closed everything down, I was like, oh my God, I'm dying to see live music and I
[01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:12.680]   think it'd be really fun.
[01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:20.320]   I know has LCD sound system, which is a cover band for 90s stuff, right?
[01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:21.320]   It's 2000s.
[01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:22.920]   It's like a dance.
[01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:23.920]   Dance punk.
[01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:26.800]   That's the best way to sort of describe LCD sounds.
[01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:30.360]   And then, but he has many bands and it's going to be a battle of the bands.
[01:07:30.360 --> 01:07:31.440]   Battle of Roberto's bands.
[01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:34.760]   The other one is a daft punk cover band.
[01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:35.760]   Yeah.
[01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:40.360]   So we recreate the daft punks 2007 a live tour.
[01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:41.360]   Oh, nice.
[01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:45.920]   I was like, we don't have a giant pyramid and all that stuff, but we do have giant.
[01:07:45.920 --> 01:07:49.400]   Daft punk comments that we wear that we can't see a damn thing out of.
[01:07:49.400 --> 01:07:52.720]   So we have to wear special visors with cameras.
[01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:53.720]   It's ridiculous.
[01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:56.520]   And then I have to like, I have to run two computers at the same time.
[01:07:56.520 --> 01:07:58.640]   And then I have like my DJ mix.
[01:07:58.640 --> 01:07:59.640]   It's yeah, it's exactly.
[01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:03.160]   That's what it looks like inside the helmet.
[01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:04.160]   I look exactly.
[01:08:04.160 --> 01:08:05.640]   I can't wait to see it.
[01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:06.640]   So what?
[01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:09.560]   Someone should replace someone should replace one of your computers and like just put like
[01:08:09.560 --> 01:08:10.560]   a raccoon or something.
[01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:14.680]   So you think that you're computer and it's actually like a raccoon and then you like get
[01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:16.240]   the live reaction of.
[01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:19.120]   Well, you're weird, Georgia.
[01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:21.120]   You got some weird fantasies.
[01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:23.080]   Why wouldn't you want to see a raccoon?
[01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:24.080]   It's so great.
[01:08:24.080 --> 01:08:30.760]   If I were in a band and someone brought up a raccoon while my band, any of my bands, whether
[01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:35.160]   it's the original bands that no one goes to because no one cares or any of the cover
[01:08:35.160 --> 01:08:39.120]   and tribute bands, someone brought a live raccoon and put it on stage and he had like
[01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:40.120]   little earphones.
[01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:41.520]   So you wouldn't heard his hearing.
[01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:42.520]   And you didn't know.
[01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:43.520]   And you didn't know.
[01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:46.800]   And you are playing a raccoon.
[01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:49.760]   Where should you guys micro dosing right now?
[01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:50.760]   Is that what's going on?
[01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:51.760]   Is that what I'm missing?
[01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:53.920]   Let me just say it.
[01:08:53.920 --> 01:08:55.520]   Friendly reminder for those listening.
[01:08:55.520 --> 01:08:56.520]   Don't listen to Georgia.
[01:08:56.520 --> 01:08:57.520]   Though I love her.
[01:08:57.520 --> 01:08:58.520]   She's Canadian.
[01:08:58.520 --> 01:09:00.720]   Secondly, Uncle Leo, let's get this money.
[01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:01.720]   I'm gonna.
[01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:04.920]   But first, first I was trying to give Roberto a plug.
[01:09:04.920 --> 01:09:10.480]   I want everybody to sign up for your newsletter so they'll know when this event is where can
[01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:11.680]   they do that?
[01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:14.000]   Oh gosh.
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:15.000]   What's your website?
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:19.240]   North American scum the band dot com.
[01:09:19.240 --> 01:09:23.680]   North American scum the band dot com.
[01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:28.840]   Or you can just put n-a-s-c-u-m dot com and it'll auto send you to that.
[01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:32.320]   And then if you click the contact button, you can sign up for the newsletter, which I
[01:09:32.320 --> 01:09:36.360]   just did because I want this to be my first live show back.
[01:09:36.360 --> 01:09:38.480]   So that's there you have it right there.
[01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:39.480]   North American scum.
[01:09:39.480 --> 01:09:40.880]   There's Roberto, by the way.
[01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:42.080]   My hand in the air.
[01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:43.080]   With his hand.
[01:09:43.080 --> 01:09:44.080]   You look good.
[01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:45.080]   I dress up nice for you people.
[01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:46.080]   That's a great picture.
[01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:51.800]   I have a nice shirt and I wear slacks and I jump around like a like a like a like a rabid
[01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:52.800]   raccoon.
[01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:56.760]   So if there's another raccoon on stage, how come you're at home?
[01:09:56.760 --> 01:10:01.080]   You and your drummer and your keyboardist are dressed up nice and then your basis looks
[01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:02.240]   like a lumberjack.
[01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:03.240]   What's the story there?
[01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:04.240]   Oh, that's Stu.
[01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:06.240]   Stu is no longer in the band.
[01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:12.080]   We have another big player who's also very tall, but Stu is probably one of the best people
[01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:13.360]   I've ever met in my whole life.
[01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:15.400]   Not just an amazing bass player and amazing.
[01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:18.280]   So you didn't make him wear a tie?
[01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:22.160]   No, everyone can wear whatever they want.
[01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:23.160]   There's no rules.
[01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:24.160]   There's no rules.
[01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:25.160]   But the whole.
[01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:27.760]   The raccoon on stage we've had a tie.
[01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:29.160]   Whatever you feel comfortable.
[01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:30.160]   I've heard the band.
[01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:35.280]   I'm saying if your name is Stu and you're the bass player in the band, consider your
[01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:36.280]   days numbered.
[01:10:36.280 --> 01:10:37.280]   That's all I'm saying.
[01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:39.280]   I don't know.
[01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:41.560]   That's a obscure reference.
[01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:45.840]   Our show today brought to you by worldwide technology.
[01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:52.720]   You know, speaking of the last thing you did, March 2020, we flew out to St. Louis, hugged
[01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:54.680]   a bunch of people were my technology.
[01:10:54.680 --> 01:10:56.560]   And I think about that every day.
[01:10:56.560 --> 01:10:57.560]   No, I don't.
[01:10:57.560 --> 01:10:59.080]   But I think they're the greatest.
[01:10:59.080 --> 01:11:04.760]   They have partnered with Dell Technologies to bring you amazing thing.
[01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:06.320]   Their Advanced Technology Center.
[01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:08.640]   We went out and saw it in St. Louis.
[01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:13.120]   It started with one building and it's expanded to many buildings, rack after rack of the
[01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:19.160]   top of the line enterprise gear, more than half a billion dollars in hardware and software
[01:11:19.160 --> 01:11:21.600]   from hundreds of technology companies.
[01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:24.080]   Why would you care because you can use it yourself?
[01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:29.840]   There's WWT's engineers use it to quickly spin up proofs of concept and pilots.
[01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:35.440]   They use the ATCs to help customers confidently select the best solutions.
[01:11:35.440 --> 01:11:40.760]   But you can also use the ATC as lab as a service, which is amazing.
[01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:45.440]   It's a dedicated lab space within the Advanced Technology Center where customers you can perform
[01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:50.160]   programmatic testing of your own using that half billion dollar ecosystem.
[01:11:50.160 --> 01:11:55.040]   The latest of on-demand and schedulable labs, things like Dell's VX Rail, CyberRecoverySolutions
[01:11:55.040 --> 01:11:56.320]   Power Store.
[01:11:56.320 --> 01:11:57.520]   We saw the Dell Power Store.
[01:11:57.520 --> 01:11:58.520]   Those are beautiful.
[01:11:58.520 --> 01:12:00.080]   Man, they look great in the rack.
[01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:04.040]   Unity PowerMax Data Protection Central, IDPA.
[01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:06.920]   The newest advance is a primary storage.
[01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:09.080]   And you can try them yourselves.
[01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:14.160]   Other labs at the ATC represent the latest advances in things like multi-cloud architecture,
[01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:20.060]   security, networking automation, primary and secondary storage, data analytics, AI, data
[01:12:20.060 --> 01:12:24.480]   analytics, AI dev ops, everything any business might want to know about.
[01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:29.120]   You can find out about WWT's Advanced Technology Center.
[01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:34.200]   And because it's virtual, you can use it anywhere in the world anytime of the day or
[01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:35.200]   night.
[01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:36.200]   It's there for you.
[01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:37.200]   WWT's engineer.
[01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:40.000]   We met a lot of the engineers and I said, "You must love your job."
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:41.400]   This is the best job in the world.
[01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:44.000]   We get to play with the latest, greatest stuff.
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:48.920]   They're in there every day, beta testing, new equipment, building reference architectures,
[01:12:48.920 --> 01:12:54.620]   doing custom integrations for their customers so their customers can see results, make decisions,
[01:12:54.620 --> 01:12:56.660]   figure out what's going to work without a big investment.
[01:12:56.660 --> 01:12:58.860]   It's really kind of impressive.
[01:12:58.860 --> 01:13:03.860]   WWT's ATC platform encompasses the entire lab ecosystem.
[01:13:03.860 --> 01:13:08.500]   And it creates a multiplier effect of knowledge and speed and agility available anytime, anywhere
[01:13:08.500 --> 01:13:11.420]   around the world for its customers and partners.
[01:13:11.420 --> 01:13:17.100]   Not just labs, there's technical articles, there's demonstration videos, white papers,
[01:13:17.100 --> 01:13:20.780]   anything you need to stay up to date with the latest technology.
[01:13:20.780 --> 01:13:23.640]   And while you're there exploring the ATC platform, do me a favor.

[01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:20.320]   WWT can't wait to get out to St. Louis.
[01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:25.080]   Right after I go see North American scum the band, I'm going to St. Louis.
[01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:26.960]   Do you ever go to St. Louis to play?
[01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:29.120]   Do you have a band tour or do you just play the Bay Area?
[01:14:29.120 --> 01:14:30.840]   No, we just play the Bay Area.
[01:14:30.840 --> 01:14:35.640]   We occasionally will have someone who will reach out to us and ask us to play somewhere
[01:14:35.640 --> 01:14:37.320]   far away.
[01:14:37.320 --> 01:14:40.060]   Because we're all working adults, we have jobs.
[01:14:40.060 --> 01:14:41.060]   We have every show.
[01:14:41.060 --> 01:14:42.460]   And there's seven to eight of us.
[01:14:42.460 --> 01:14:43.700]   Well everybody except you.
[01:14:43.700 --> 01:14:44.700]   Yeah, well, yeah.
[01:14:44.700 --> 01:14:47.260]   There's seven to eight of us.
[01:14:47.260 --> 01:14:48.260]   It's expensive.
[01:14:48.260 --> 01:14:51.660]   It's expensive to ship all of us and our gear to another place.
[01:14:51.660 --> 01:14:54.180]   So we typically don't really leave the Bay Area.
[01:14:54.180 --> 01:14:55.340]   Are you a party band?
[01:14:55.340 --> 01:14:56.500]   Is that the category?
[01:14:56.500 --> 01:15:01.540]   Yeah, it's all the whole, we don't play any slow songs.
[01:15:01.540 --> 01:15:02.540]   Everything is about dancing.
[01:15:02.540 --> 01:15:04.940]   We just want people to have fun and dance.
[01:15:04.940 --> 01:15:11.280]   I've been in that sort of like the punk band when I was in my early 20s where you cared
[01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:14.000]   about your feelings and you cared about what everyone thought.
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:17.760]   And you had a slow song and a bunch of fast songs and someone in the band would get angry
[01:15:17.760 --> 01:15:21.520]   because they came with the song and everyone else in the band's like, that sucks.
[01:15:21.520 --> 01:15:28.000]   So I decided to create these tribute bands where we're just here to have fun.
[01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:29.000]   That's it.
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:30.000]   That's the whole point of the band.
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:31.000]   Perfect.
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:32.000]   Just have fun.
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:33.000]   That's my favorite kind of band.
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:34.000]   Yeah.
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.620]   This must have been a hard year.
[01:15:36.620 --> 01:15:39.340]   This must have been such a hard year because you can't do it, right?
[01:15:39.340 --> 01:15:40.340]   Nobody's.
[01:15:40.340 --> 01:15:43.120]   Yeah, I haven't seen any of my bands.
[01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:45.180]   We haven't done any practices.
[01:15:45.180 --> 01:15:48.980]   I have a lot of bands for some because it's something that I like to do.
[01:15:48.980 --> 01:15:50.580]   I like that we hang out.
[01:15:50.580 --> 01:15:53.540]   It's like, people are always concerned about, you know, I'm never going to make a friend
[01:15:53.540 --> 01:15:54.540]   after the age of 30.
[01:15:54.540 --> 01:15:55.540]   I've made new friends.
[01:15:55.540 --> 01:15:58.460]   That's my band who are in other bands.
[01:15:58.460 --> 01:16:02.860]   And once a week we go, we learn a bunch of songs and then once a month or so we play
[01:16:02.860 --> 01:16:06.520]   a show and a bunch of people dance and we dance and we get all sweaty and we get all
[01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:12.480]   tired and we sleep in the next day.
[01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:13.720]   Let's see here.
[01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:20.920]   Amazon driver quits because the company has put in a camera that can sense when he's yawning
[01:16:20.920 --> 01:16:22.720]   or doesn't use a seat belt.
[01:16:22.720 --> 01:16:26.480]   Is that a story?
[01:16:26.480 --> 01:16:28.240]   The yawning part is a problem.
[01:16:28.240 --> 01:16:30.440]   The seatbelt thing is important.
[01:16:30.440 --> 01:16:37.660]   But doesn't it bother you that there's a camera that's stalking you for work?
[01:16:37.660 --> 01:16:43.940]   It doesn't let go to like, I don't want a camera to know when I pick out my nose.
[01:16:43.940 --> 01:16:44.940]   It's all a creepy.
[01:16:44.940 --> 01:16:47.660]   How far should a company go?
[01:16:47.660 --> 01:16:51.740]   There's a whole bunch of companies now that have access to your webcam.
[01:16:51.740 --> 01:16:52.980]   That was another story.
[01:16:52.980 --> 01:16:55.700]   So they could watch if you were at the computer or not.
[01:16:55.700 --> 01:16:57.180]   Is that an invasion of privacy?
[01:16:57.180 --> 01:16:58.340]   I don't know.
[01:16:58.340 --> 01:16:59.860]   Do they own you just because you're driving there?
[01:16:59.860 --> 01:17:04.040]   Nobody in the chat room is saying Amazon treats their workers like robots.
[01:17:04.040 --> 01:17:10.220]   And I think that that's maybe the underlying story here is that from Amazon management's
[01:17:10.220 --> 01:17:16.540]   point of view, the guys and gals working in the warehouse, the drivers, they're cogs in
[01:17:16.540 --> 01:17:17.940]   a giant machine.
[01:17:17.940 --> 01:17:19.740]   They're not human beings.
[01:17:19.740 --> 01:17:25.460]   So these camera systems, it's called driver eye, driver in the letter I, manufactured by
[01:17:25.460 --> 01:17:28.620]   a company called Netradine.
[01:17:28.620 --> 01:17:30.660]   The cameras are always on.
[01:17:30.660 --> 01:17:35.140]   They scan drivers body language, the speed of the vehicle, which Amazon, by the way,
[01:17:35.140 --> 01:17:36.420]   they have every right to do this.
[01:17:36.420 --> 01:17:37.420]   It's their vehicles.
[01:17:37.420 --> 01:17:38.420]   Speed of the vehicle.
[01:17:38.420 --> 01:17:39.420]   Yeah.
[01:17:39.420 --> 01:17:40.420]   Drowsiness.
[01:17:40.420 --> 01:17:41.420]   That seems sensible.
[01:17:41.420 --> 01:17:42.420]   In fact, Roberto, right?
[01:17:42.420 --> 01:17:43.820]   The Cadillac and a number of other vehicles.
[01:17:43.820 --> 01:17:51.700]   A lot of vehicles, they have drowsiness detectors, but they also, most fleet management systems
[01:17:51.700 --> 01:17:56.260]   already tell you how fast the car is going, how efficient it is.
[01:17:56.260 --> 01:18:01.540]   They don't need a camera inside the car to tell you how fast you're going.
[01:18:01.540 --> 01:18:02.980]   They're already tracking the vehicle.
[01:18:02.980 --> 01:18:09.820]   So adding another camera and saying, oh, it's because of speed and drowsiness, that's BS.
[01:18:09.820 --> 01:18:11.340]   And who's watching all that?
[01:18:11.340 --> 01:18:17.220]   I mean, I don't really, every driver, UPS drivers, their device itself will say if it's
[01:18:17.220 --> 01:18:23.060]   sedentary too long, if it hasn't moved, if it's moving too fast, like there's a geometry
[01:18:23.060 --> 01:18:26.860]   or scope in there that tells, gives a whole lot of information on the driver, you know
[01:18:26.860 --> 01:18:27.860]   what I mean?
[01:18:27.860 --> 01:18:30.540]   So other than being on camera, but I'm like, who watches this thing?
[01:18:30.540 --> 01:18:35.220]   And at the end of the day, the thing I see online all the time is like, Oh, Jeff Bezos
[01:18:35.220 --> 01:18:36.220]   are $200 million.
[01:18:36.220 --> 01:18:39.060]   When's he going to become Iron Man or Batman?
[01:18:39.060 --> 01:18:41.060]   They don't understand this dude is Lex Luthor.
[01:18:41.060 --> 01:18:42.060]   He's evil.
[01:18:42.060 --> 01:18:44.340]   He's not going to be Iron Man.
[01:18:44.340 --> 01:18:45.340]   All right.
[01:18:45.340 --> 01:18:46.340]   He's bald.
[01:18:46.340 --> 01:18:47.340]   He's bald as a cuban.
[01:18:47.340 --> 01:18:48.340]   He's bald as a new thing.
[01:18:48.340 --> 01:18:49.340]   Right in your face.
[01:18:49.340 --> 01:18:52.020]   And you don't even realize he's Lex.
[01:18:52.020 --> 01:18:55.740]   Amazon says the footage is not automatically pumped to Amazon.
[01:18:55.740 --> 01:19:00.380]   The live feed only turns on after a safety or policy violation is detected.
[01:19:00.380 --> 01:19:03.900]   I'd like to know what the policies are chewing on.
[01:19:03.900 --> 01:19:08.780]   By the way, they have a voice comes on if you violate and says something.
[01:19:08.780 --> 01:19:11.020]   There's an automated verbal alert.
[01:19:11.020 --> 01:19:12.020]   Wow.
[01:19:12.020 --> 01:19:14.020]   I don't like it.
[01:19:14.020 --> 01:19:15.020]   I would.
[01:19:15.020 --> 01:19:18.820]   It's right up there when I let people go to the bathroom at an warehouse.
[01:19:18.820 --> 01:19:21.340]   But then you have the right to quit.
[01:19:21.340 --> 01:19:22.340]   You know, right?
[01:19:22.340 --> 01:19:24.060]   I mean, you don't have to.
[01:19:24.060 --> 01:19:25.660]   That's why people should unionize.
[01:19:25.660 --> 01:19:27.060]   Unlike unionize already.
[01:19:27.060 --> 01:19:28.060]   Yeah, I agree.
[01:19:28.060 --> 01:19:29.060]   I agree.
[01:19:29.060 --> 01:19:31.340]   And of course, Amazon's fighting that tooth and nail.
[01:19:31.340 --> 01:19:32.700]   That's the thing they really don't want.
[01:19:32.700 --> 01:19:35.260]   When the big bad doesn't want you to do it, that's the sign.
[01:19:35.260 --> 01:19:36.260]   Maybe you should be doing it.
[01:19:36.260 --> 01:19:37.260]   Yeah.
[01:19:37.260 --> 01:19:38.260]   Exactly.
[01:19:38.260 --> 01:19:39.260]   Right?
[01:19:39.260 --> 01:19:40.980]   It's like the guy with the holding the gun says, you know what?
[01:19:40.980 --> 01:19:41.980]   Don't run away.
[01:19:41.980 --> 01:19:42.980]   Stay quiet.
[01:19:42.980 --> 01:19:44.740]   Get into the trunk of the car.
[01:19:44.740 --> 01:19:46.860]   Maybe you should not listen to the guy with the gun.
[01:19:46.860 --> 01:19:47.860]   Yes.
[01:19:47.860 --> 01:19:48.860]   Yeah.
[01:19:48.860 --> 01:19:49.860]   Well, maybe you should if he's got a gun.
[01:19:49.860 --> 01:19:50.860]   Is the gun loaded?
[01:19:50.860 --> 01:19:52.860]   You're not coming back from the second location.
[01:19:52.860 --> 01:19:55.780]   If I can say thank you, Roberto.
[01:19:55.780 --> 01:19:56.780]   Thank you.
[01:19:56.780 --> 01:19:58.580]   The second location is never going to be better.
[01:19:58.580 --> 01:20:03.220]   He's not moving you to a location where you'll have better chances of getting away.
[01:20:03.220 --> 01:20:04.220]   Wait a minute.
[01:20:04.220 --> 01:20:05.740]   I feel like there's a life lesson here.
[01:20:05.740 --> 01:20:06.940]   Never, ever, ever.
[01:20:06.940 --> 01:20:11.260]   You fight right away when someone tries used to teach self defense.
[01:20:11.260 --> 01:20:16.780]   You fight right away when someone tries to move you from location one to location two.
[01:20:16.780 --> 01:20:18.900]   It never gets better.
[01:20:18.900 --> 01:20:20.260]   You have the greatest chance.
[01:20:20.260 --> 01:20:25.980]   The most least amount of risk go whether they have a gun, a knife, anything, I get it.
[01:20:25.980 --> 01:20:28.660]   You're scared, but don't let them move you.
[01:20:28.660 --> 01:20:31.900]   I sounds like you guys know this and I never learned this.
[01:20:31.900 --> 01:20:34.620]   So tell me again, you're not leaving the second location.
[01:20:34.620 --> 01:20:35.620]   Don't go.
[01:20:35.620 --> 01:20:36.620]   Never.
[01:20:36.620 --> 01:20:37.620]   Yeah.
[01:20:37.620 --> 01:20:38.620]   You're not coming back.
[01:20:38.620 --> 01:20:42.540]   So you're in a location where you know it.
[01:20:42.540 --> 01:20:43.660]   You put yourself there.
[01:20:43.660 --> 01:20:47.900]   You understand where you can escape to when they're trying to move you to a second location.
[01:20:47.900 --> 01:20:53.460]   It is only so they can do horrible things to you in a place where they know you are
[01:20:53.460 --> 01:20:55.260]   far, they're bad people.
[01:20:55.260 --> 01:20:56.260]   They're bad.
[01:20:56.260 --> 01:20:57.820]   They control the second location.
[01:20:57.820 --> 01:20:59.380]   And they've chosen it.
[01:20:59.380 --> 01:21:00.380]   They have chosen it.
[01:21:00.380 --> 01:21:01.900]   Roberto, how do you know this?
[01:21:01.900 --> 01:21:04.820]   Are you also a martial arts instructor?
[01:21:04.820 --> 01:21:09.780]   No, but am I an idiot that I don't know this?
[01:21:09.780 --> 01:21:13.100]   I think this is probably something that we probably learned as kids.
[01:21:13.100 --> 01:21:14.140]   I'm like in my 40s.
[01:21:14.140 --> 01:21:19.180]   So maybe stranger danger was kind of a thing to start being.
[01:21:19.180 --> 01:21:23.780]   But also there's a really good John Mulaney sketch a bit about second location.
[01:21:23.780 --> 01:21:26.900]   So if you learn it from John Mulaney, there you go.
[01:21:26.900 --> 01:21:27.900]   Okay.
[01:21:27.900 --> 01:21:28.900]   Don't go to the second location.
[01:21:28.900 --> 01:21:30.500]   No, never go to a second location.
[01:21:30.500 --> 01:21:31.500]   No, fight right away.
[01:21:31.500 --> 01:21:33.700]   If there's anything you've learned on today's show.
[01:21:33.700 --> 01:21:34.700]   Yeah, I know.
[01:21:34.700 --> 01:21:37.620]   But one thing that you should carry from this show.
[01:21:37.620 --> 01:21:40.660]   So it is life and death.
[01:21:40.660 --> 01:21:43.580]   Make sure that you don't ever let someone move you.
[01:21:43.580 --> 01:21:44.580]   There's some cases.
[01:21:44.580 --> 01:21:46.500]   What if they're going to kill me if I don't?
[01:21:46.500 --> 01:21:49.340]   But they won't because that's the reason they want me to go to the second location because
[01:21:49.340 --> 01:21:51.060]   it's not safe to kill me here.
[01:21:51.060 --> 01:21:52.060]   Yes, exactly.
[01:21:52.060 --> 01:21:53.060]   Exactly.
[01:21:53.060 --> 01:21:54.060]   You have a close patient.
[01:21:54.060 --> 01:21:55.060]   You have a close patient.
[01:21:55.060 --> 01:21:56.060]   Yeah.
[01:21:56.060 --> 01:21:57.060]   Yeah.
[01:21:57.060 --> 01:21:58.060]   Go ahead, Roberto.
[01:21:58.060 --> 01:21:59.060]   Say it.
[01:21:59.060 --> 01:22:00.060]   And when you run, you run back and forth.
[01:22:00.060 --> 01:22:01.060]   No, no one's going to do that, Roberto.
[01:22:01.060 --> 01:22:02.060]   No one's doing the alligator.
[01:22:02.060 --> 01:22:03.060]   No one's doing the alligators.
[01:22:03.060 --> 01:22:08.500]   If they say like if you're going to run from an alligator zigzag, I'm sorry.
[01:22:08.500 --> 01:22:09.500]   You're brain.
[01:22:09.500 --> 01:22:10.500]   That's close.
[01:22:10.500 --> 01:22:11.500]   You know, I didn't know.
[01:22:11.500 --> 01:22:12.500]   That's not what you did.
[01:22:12.500 --> 01:22:13.500]   I didn't know that.
[01:22:13.500 --> 01:22:14.500]   You didn't know that.
[01:22:14.500 --> 01:22:15.500]   You didn't know that.
[01:22:15.500 --> 01:22:16.500]   You didn't know that.
[01:22:16.500 --> 01:22:17.500]   Oh, okay.
[01:22:17.500 --> 01:22:18.500]   You should go.
[01:22:18.500 --> 01:22:19.500]   It's also your brain cannot.
[01:22:19.500 --> 01:22:20.500]   You're not.
[01:22:20.500 --> 01:22:21.500]   Again, remember, in fight or flight, you are just going to do it.
[01:22:21.500 --> 01:22:28.140]   The you fight attack, you flight run, you freeze or you faint.
[01:22:28.140 --> 01:22:29.940]   Those are your options.
[01:22:29.940 --> 01:22:31.940]   There's no zigzagging that's going to happen.
[01:22:31.940 --> 01:22:34.940]   Now, if I'm a rich man, I like to be agreeable movement.
[01:22:34.940 --> 01:22:36.380]   My thing is to just be nice.
[01:22:36.380 --> 01:22:37.380]   Say, hey, man.
[01:22:37.380 --> 01:22:39.380]   No, you can be that nice, though.
[01:22:39.380 --> 01:22:40.980]   Let me tell you something.
[01:22:40.980 --> 01:22:45.220]   I got held up at gunpoint.
[01:22:45.220 --> 01:22:47.940]   Guy was like, oh, give me your wallet and your keys.
[01:22:47.940 --> 01:22:49.300]   And I was like, sure, no problem.
[01:22:49.300 --> 01:22:52.380]   Mind you, I keep my money in my pocket and I'll keep anything in my wallet.
[01:22:52.380 --> 01:22:54.460]   And I was like, oh, and my keys are over here.
[01:22:54.460 --> 01:22:57.420]   But you should keep a token amount in your wallet so he doesn't know that there's other
[01:22:57.420 --> 01:22:58.420]   money.
[01:22:58.420 --> 01:22:59.420]   Oh, yeah.
[01:22:59.420 --> 01:23:00.420]   Yeah.
[01:23:00.420 --> 01:23:01.420]   Yeah.
[01:23:01.420 --> 01:23:02.420]   Keep a five in the.
[01:23:02.420 --> 01:23:03.420]   Yes.
[01:23:03.420 --> 01:23:04.420]   Yes.
[01:23:04.420 --> 01:23:05.420]   Yes.
[01:23:05.420 --> 01:23:06.420]   Long story short, I was so agreeable that he didn't realize that he was just following me
[01:23:06.420 --> 01:23:07.420]   as I was walking.
[01:23:07.420 --> 01:23:09.140]   I was like, oh, yeah, I'll give my keys right there.
[01:23:09.140 --> 01:23:13.060]   And as a walking, I'm in my apartment complex and I walked just far enough out to where
[01:23:13.060 --> 01:23:14.740]   this girl could see me out on her balcony.
[01:23:14.740 --> 01:23:16.500]   I'm like, hi, how you doing?
[01:23:16.500 --> 01:23:17.500]   And she's like, hey, what's going on?
[01:23:17.500 --> 01:23:20.820]   I just started walking towards her and then the guy had to run off because he wasn't going
[01:23:20.820 --> 01:23:21.820]   to do anything.
[01:23:21.820 --> 01:23:23.820]   I'm going to shoot you in front of my witness.
[01:23:23.820 --> 01:23:24.820]   You're right.
[01:23:24.820 --> 01:23:25.820]   You're right.
[01:23:25.820 --> 01:23:26.820]   You're right.
[01:23:26.820 --> 01:23:27.820]   You're right.
[01:23:27.820 --> 01:23:28.820]   But you're right, though.
[01:23:28.820 --> 01:23:32.820]   Oh, and if they want your keys, your wallet, your car, it's not worth it.
[01:23:32.820 --> 01:23:33.820]   Give it to them.
[01:23:33.820 --> 01:23:34.820]   Give it to them.
[01:23:34.820 --> 01:23:35.820]   Who cares?
[01:23:35.820 --> 01:23:36.820]   Because here's my problem.
[01:23:36.820 --> 01:23:40.060]   You want to move you, they don't want your keys.
[01:23:40.060 --> 01:23:41.060]   Here's my problem.
[01:23:41.060 --> 01:23:44.500]   You're assuming that this person is rational.
[01:23:44.500 --> 01:23:46.940]   I mean, this guy could shoot you.
[01:23:46.940 --> 01:23:47.940]   He doesn't know anything.
[01:23:47.940 --> 01:23:48.940]   He says, I don't care.
[01:23:48.940 --> 01:23:49.940]   There's a witness.
[01:23:49.940 --> 01:23:53.380]   If he wants to move you, he wants to move you.
[01:23:53.380 --> 01:23:54.380]   That's rational.
[01:23:54.380 --> 01:23:57.220]   He's probably not rational, but you know, like again, they're my.
[01:23:57.220 --> 01:23:59.100]   I'm not so much I have a daughter.
[01:23:59.100 --> 01:24:01.460]   So I'm not so much worried about moving her.
[01:24:01.460 --> 01:24:04.180]   I'm worried about people taking advantage of her in certain situations.
[01:24:04.180 --> 01:24:06.580]   So I mean, the whole moving thing.
[01:24:06.580 --> 01:24:08.940]   I mean, kidnapping is very rare instance.
[01:24:08.940 --> 01:24:14.140]   So if you have a daughter or female, their biggest worry is somebody they might know,
[01:24:14.140 --> 01:24:16.540]   be at a party somewhere, the music's too loud.
[01:24:16.540 --> 01:24:18.620]   I mean, I'm teaching my daughter in events of that.
[01:24:18.620 --> 01:24:19.620]   Like, oh, yes.
[01:24:19.620 --> 01:24:20.620]   Yeah, that's practical.
[01:24:20.620 --> 01:24:21.620]   Yeah.
[01:24:21.620 --> 01:24:24.180]   Play nice for 30 seconds till you get yourself in a position.
[01:24:24.180 --> 01:24:26.820]   I mean, mind you, she's a brown belt and she does your GSA.
[01:24:26.820 --> 01:24:28.060]   I'm gonna make a wrestling like that.
[01:24:28.060 --> 01:24:29.060]   She can handle her.
[01:24:29.060 --> 01:24:32.900]   So like you play nice until you get into a position of power and then you knock him out.
[01:24:32.900 --> 01:24:33.900]   You go ahead.
[01:24:33.900 --> 01:24:35.820]   I like your I like the way you handled that.
[01:24:35.820 --> 01:24:39.500]   Oh, and though you were agreeable and you slowly walked to a position where other people
[01:24:39.500 --> 01:24:41.620]   were around and the guy said, I that's it.
[01:24:41.620 --> 01:24:42.620]   We're done.
[01:24:42.620 --> 01:24:44.620]   And again, he's the rest of the position.
[01:24:44.620 --> 01:24:47.100]   He went to his second location where he was in control.
[01:24:47.100 --> 01:24:48.100]   That's that.
[01:24:48.100 --> 01:24:52.380]   So the rule holds whether you're the good guy or the bad guy.
[01:24:52.380 --> 01:24:55.060]   Don't let the good guy take you a second location either.
[01:24:55.060 --> 01:24:56.460]   Are you guys going to get you?
[01:24:56.460 --> 01:24:57.460]   Nice to the bad guys.
[01:24:57.460 --> 01:25:00.100]   And somebody can somebody look up on the main camera.
[01:25:00.100 --> 01:25:01.100]   Watch.
[01:25:01.100 --> 01:25:02.860]   Put me on the main camera.
[01:25:02.860 --> 01:25:04.140]   This is a technology show.
[01:25:04.140 --> 01:25:06.380]   We are not life analysts and drivers.
[01:25:06.380 --> 01:25:07.700]   We not take anything.
[01:25:07.700 --> 01:25:09.780]   We say go find yourself.
[01:25:09.780 --> 01:25:12.380]   Oh, it's never going to go to a second location.
[01:25:12.380 --> 01:25:17.780]   Don't listen to anything we say in an advice you need to live and survive.
[01:25:17.780 --> 01:25:21.100]   When I'm teaching my daughters for her own education, well, Leo taught why he ain't he
[01:25:21.100 --> 01:25:22.620]   never had to be in a situation.
[01:25:22.620 --> 01:25:23.620]   Don't listen to us.
[01:25:23.620 --> 01:25:25.620]   Entertain that good guys only.
[01:25:25.620 --> 01:25:26.620]   Yes.
[01:25:26.620 --> 01:25:28.980]   I have to say I've never been robbed.
[01:25:28.980 --> 01:25:29.980]   I've never been held up.
[01:25:29.980 --> 01:25:32.100]   I've never been pickpocketed.
[01:25:32.100 --> 01:25:33.100]   Nothing.
[01:25:33.100 --> 01:25:34.940]   I know that's happened to me, which means immediately after I leave the studio today,
[01:25:34.940 --> 01:25:39.060]   I will be robbed, pickpocketed and murdered just so you know.
[01:25:39.060 --> 01:25:41.180]   First of the day, take into a second location.
[01:25:41.180 --> 01:25:42.460]   They're going to take me to second location.
[01:25:42.460 --> 01:25:48.060]   I've brought down the wrath of the gods just by saying that Instagram has announced who
[01:25:48.060 --> 01:25:53.780]   knew it will no longer let adults message teens who don't follow them.
[01:25:53.780 --> 01:25:56.900]   Huh, that's great.
[01:25:56.900 --> 01:25:57.900]   That's about time.
[01:25:57.900 --> 01:25:59.300]   I didn't even know that you could.
[01:25:59.300 --> 01:26:00.300]   Yeah.
[01:26:00.300 --> 01:26:02.700]   My daughter gets to put requests all the time.
[01:26:02.700 --> 01:26:03.700]   Wait, what?
[01:26:03.700 --> 01:26:04.700]   Never.
[01:26:04.700 --> 01:26:05.700]   No, no, no.
[01:26:05.700 --> 01:26:06.700]   I cut out.
[01:26:06.700 --> 01:26:07.700]   I go there.
[01:26:07.700 --> 01:26:12.500]   No, it's a no because it is to the thing.
[01:26:12.500 --> 01:26:14.900]   Like she would obviously again, me and her have a great relationship.
[01:26:14.900 --> 01:26:16.900]   She explains everything to me and she comes to me.
[01:26:16.900 --> 01:26:20.580]   You know, obviously she blocks the people that send her inappropriate stuff, but people
[01:26:20.580 --> 01:26:25.220]   do and at one time the one guy went and came through another thing and I reported him and
[01:26:25.220 --> 01:26:30.020]   I'm soon to send myself dummy me what I should have did was say, Hey, pay pal me to $500
[01:26:30.020 --> 01:26:34.220]   and I don't send a picture of my feet or like alligator feet and then look for them after
[01:26:34.220 --> 01:26:36.220]   I got to $500 and block.
[01:26:36.220 --> 01:26:39.820]   You finally do this.
[01:26:39.820 --> 01:26:41.420]   You Facebook.
[01:26:41.420 --> 01:26:48.140]   However, after announcing Instagram will no longer a dead adults message teens as announced
[01:26:48.140 --> 01:26:51.580]   that they are going to make an Instagram for kids under the age of 13.
[01:26:51.580 --> 01:26:53.220]   What could possibly go wrong?
[01:26:53.220 --> 01:26:56.820]   They'll never use it unless they're five in their mouth running their account.
[01:26:56.820 --> 01:26:57.820]   Yeah.
[01:26:57.820 --> 01:26:59.620]   They have that fenced is they're not going to use them.
[01:26:59.620 --> 01:27:00.720]   I'm going to do that.
[01:27:00.720 --> 01:27:03.740]   I mean, that's the problem with that.
[01:27:03.740 --> 01:27:08.420]   Internal Instagram post obtained by BuzzFeed news says, quote, we have identified youth
[01:27:08.420 --> 01:27:10.820]   work as a priority for Instagram.
[01:27:10.820 --> 01:27:14.140]   I've added it to our H one priority list.
[01:27:14.140 --> 01:27:15.140]   Youth work.
[01:27:15.140 --> 01:27:21.540]   You know, you use like, like, you know, when they were like miners and stuff.
[01:27:21.540 --> 01:27:22.540]   Yeah.
[01:27:22.540 --> 01:27:27.420]   We will now instead of making my non self exploiting children by sending them on the ground, we
[01:27:27.420 --> 01:27:28.940]   exploited them with ads.
[01:27:28.940 --> 01:27:29.940]   Yeah.
[01:27:29.940 --> 01:27:30.220]   This is a V.
[01:27:30.220 --> 01:27:34.780]   Charles Shaw, who's Instagram's vice president of product writing on an employee message
[01:27:34.780 --> 01:27:35.780]   board.
[01:27:35.780 --> 01:27:37.340]   But of course, nothing is private these days.
[01:27:37.340 --> 01:27:42.780]   We will be building a new youth pillar within the community product group to focus on two
[01:27:42.780 --> 01:27:44.980]   things.
[01:27:44.980 --> 01:27:49.180]   This is I think informative about how they think about these things, accelerating our
[01:27:49.180 --> 01:27:54.460]   integrity and privacy work to ensure the safest possible experience for teens and building
[01:27:54.460 --> 01:27:59.140]   a version of Instagram that lets people under the age of 13 safely use Instagram for the
[01:27:59.140 --> 01:28:02.820]   first time for the first time.
[01:28:02.820 --> 01:28:08.100]   Actually Instagram, like almost everything else because of COPPA, the child online protection
[01:28:08.100 --> 01:28:11.980]   and privacy act will not allow you to join if you're under 13.
[01:28:11.980 --> 01:28:14.220]   But of course, I don't think that stops anybody.
[01:28:14.220 --> 01:28:18.060]   They don't make any real effort to verify that.
[01:28:18.060 --> 01:28:21.140]   This makes me think about cigarettes when they used to advertise to kids.
[01:28:21.140 --> 01:28:22.140]   Yeah.
[01:28:22.140 --> 01:28:26.980]   I understand that if you don't start at a certain age, then you're not going to continue on.
[01:28:26.980 --> 01:28:27.980]   So get them young.
[01:28:27.980 --> 01:28:28.980]   Yeah.
[01:28:28.980 --> 01:28:29.980]   Hook them.
[01:28:29.980 --> 01:28:31.580]   Get them young and doctorate quickly.
[01:28:31.580 --> 01:28:34.700]   And people will once you're used to an ecosystem, you're comfortable.
[01:28:34.700 --> 01:28:36.620]   You're going to stay and keep on using it.
[01:28:36.620 --> 01:28:37.620]   That's their thought.
[01:28:37.620 --> 01:28:38.780]   That's their hope for it.
[01:28:38.780 --> 01:28:41.660]   Even though no, this is no, this is not good.
[01:28:41.660 --> 01:28:45.540]   Social media is not great for kids because most kids are not don't understand what they're
[01:28:45.540 --> 01:28:46.940]   doing, what they're posting.
[01:28:46.940 --> 01:28:48.740]   Not everyone has Owen as a dad.
[01:28:48.740 --> 01:28:49.740]   Let's just say it.
[01:28:49.740 --> 01:28:51.180]   Owen, you have to be all of our dads.
[01:28:51.180 --> 01:28:52.180]   He's a good dad.
[01:28:52.180 --> 01:28:53.180]   You'll be all our dad.
[01:28:53.180 --> 01:28:54.180]   Yeah.
[01:28:54.180 --> 01:28:56.660]   You should be there.
[01:28:56.660 --> 01:28:59.380]   This has nothing to do with indoctrinating them.
[01:28:59.380 --> 01:29:01.860]   This has to do with TikTok and Snapchat.
[01:29:01.860 --> 01:29:04.660]   They are losing the youth at an alarming rate.
[01:29:04.660 --> 01:29:11.460]   They need to do something to bring the youth back because again, sending somebody, sending
[01:29:11.460 --> 01:29:15.260]   a kid to Instagram is like sending them Facebook or a letter by pigeon.
[01:29:15.260 --> 01:29:16.260]   They don't want to go there.
[01:29:16.260 --> 01:29:17.260]   It's not real.
[01:29:17.260 --> 01:29:18.260]   It's not real.
[01:29:18.260 --> 01:29:24.860]   Maybe this is not the audience.
[01:29:24.860 --> 01:29:29.340]   When I watch TikTok, a lot of TikTokers say check out my Instagram account.
[01:29:29.340 --> 01:29:31.180]   Like they do both.
[01:29:31.180 --> 01:29:34.380]   That's like people trying to be influencers, you're saying.
[01:29:34.380 --> 01:29:38.260]   It's also the fact of check out my YouTube channel.
[01:29:38.260 --> 01:29:39.780]   Check out my Twitter, check out my whatever.
[01:29:39.780 --> 01:29:43.140]   If you're already here and you love me, I need you to love me on other platforms.
[01:29:43.140 --> 01:29:46.580]   Yeah, I can get you here and get you there.
[01:29:46.580 --> 01:29:47.580]   So that's why they do it.
[01:29:47.580 --> 01:29:52.260]   But everything you, 90% of what you watch on Instagram anymore, this interesting has
[01:29:52.260 --> 01:29:54.380]   a TikTok name flow around it.
[01:29:54.380 --> 01:29:57.740]   They've already posted it on TikTok and then they put it on Instagram.
[01:29:57.740 --> 01:30:00.700]   By the time I look at something on Instagram, my daughter's looking to be like, I'm a 92
[01:30:00.700 --> 01:30:01.700]   year old man.
[01:30:01.700 --> 01:30:03.500]   She's like, I was laughing at that two weeks ago, bro.
[01:30:03.500 --> 01:30:04.500]   Like come on.
[01:30:04.500 --> 01:30:08.420]   Like, I mean, because I don't have the same algorithm she has on TikTok.
[01:30:08.420 --> 01:30:11.780]   So she's in the cool hip from the future TikTok.
[01:30:11.780 --> 01:30:16.820]   I'm in the, hey, let me sell you some socks and a good, a dead joke.
[01:30:16.820 --> 01:30:18.380]   Now this I would buy.
[01:30:18.380 --> 01:30:19.620]   It has all cool fun stuff.
[01:30:19.620 --> 01:30:20.620]   This I would buy.
[01:30:20.620 --> 01:30:24.980]   If I could say to TikTok, I would like that cool hip younger algorithm.
[01:30:24.980 --> 01:30:27.340]   Can I trade my silver haired algorithm in?
[01:30:27.340 --> 01:30:28.820]   I would buy that.
[01:30:28.820 --> 01:30:35.460]   Wouldn't you rather give a 17 year old, give your son the TikTok for like a week and it'll
[01:30:35.460 --> 01:30:36.460]   fix it.
[01:30:36.460 --> 01:30:37.460]   It'll change everything.
[01:30:37.460 --> 01:30:40.740]   It'll fix algorithm because it learns really quick what you're into, bro.
[01:30:40.740 --> 01:30:41.740]   Real quick.
[01:30:41.740 --> 01:30:42.740]   Oh, that's disappointing.
[01:30:42.740 --> 01:30:46.540]   When I think about what I see on TikTok now, I maybe.
[01:30:46.540 --> 01:30:47.940]   Yeah, it's all your fault.
[01:30:47.940 --> 01:30:48.940]   It's all my fault.
[01:30:48.940 --> 01:30:50.420]   It's just the way the internet works, right?
[01:30:50.420 --> 01:30:56.220]   So the internet, if you look at my Twitter or my Facebook, they think that I am a 71 year
[01:30:56.220 --> 01:31:00.620]   old white man that lives in Los Angeles or New York City.
[01:31:00.620 --> 01:31:03.260]   I get as for old dating sites.
[01:31:03.260 --> 01:31:04.260]   I get dads for.
[01:31:04.260 --> 01:31:07.500]   Is that because you do that on purpose or is that just who you are?
[01:31:07.500 --> 01:31:10.660]   Oh, I did that because I don't want them selling things to me.
[01:31:10.660 --> 01:31:11.900]   I like to know what they're selling me.
[01:31:11.900 --> 01:31:15.460]   So when they're selling me old stuff, I know that they're going by my age and my location.
[01:31:15.460 --> 01:31:16.460]   You know what I mean?
[01:31:16.460 --> 01:31:19.580]   They think that I'm a wan from actually.
[01:31:19.580 --> 01:31:22.620]   I have to say it works because I really enjoy TikTok.
[01:31:22.620 --> 01:31:25.020]   So they're obviously picking the right videos.
[01:31:25.020 --> 01:31:26.020]   Yes.
[01:31:26.020 --> 01:31:29.220]   I might not enjoy Henry's TikTok because it would be for a young guy.
[01:31:29.220 --> 01:31:31.020]   Yeah, their algorithm is impressive.
[01:31:31.020 --> 01:31:32.780]   It is impressive technology.
[01:31:32.780 --> 01:31:34.260]   Yeah.
[01:31:34.260 --> 01:31:35.260]   Is it the best?
[01:31:35.260 --> 01:31:36.260]   Scary.
[01:31:36.260 --> 01:31:37.260]   What?
[01:31:37.260 --> 01:31:38.900]   And how is Snapchat still in the game?
[01:31:38.900 --> 01:31:43.420]   Isn't Instagram kick, kick, Snapchat's butt with their stories and all that?
[01:31:43.420 --> 01:31:45.420]   It's not for the old.
[01:31:45.420 --> 01:31:46.420]   For the old.
[01:31:46.420 --> 01:31:48.820]   Did you see this on my phone?
[01:31:48.820 --> 01:31:49.820]   What?
[01:31:49.820 --> 01:31:50.820]   Wait, what?
[01:31:50.820 --> 01:31:51.820]   Didn't see it, right?
[01:31:51.820 --> 01:31:53.740]   That's the point because that's why it's not cool.
[01:31:53.740 --> 01:31:56.700]   The kids are on there because they're putting up stuff to do to want people to see.
[01:31:56.700 --> 01:31:58.220]   Ah, goes away.
[01:31:58.220 --> 01:31:59.220]   Okay.
[01:31:59.220 --> 01:32:00.580]   And TikTok's exact opposite.
[01:32:00.580 --> 01:32:02.460]   It's stuff you want everybody to see.
[01:32:02.460 --> 01:32:03.460]   Yep.
[01:32:03.460 --> 01:32:04.820]   Yep.
[01:32:04.820 --> 01:32:06.900]   So I should never go to a second location.
[01:32:06.900 --> 01:32:07.900]   Is that the rule?
[01:32:07.900 --> 01:32:08.900]   That's the rule.
[01:32:08.900 --> 01:32:09.900]   I mean, I'm learning.
[01:32:09.900 --> 01:32:10.900]   I'm just learning.
[01:32:10.900 --> 01:32:11.900]   That's the rule.
[01:32:11.900 --> 01:32:15.620]   And honestly, you live in a life of bringing everyone to a second location.
[01:32:15.620 --> 01:32:18.380]   You run a show where you bring guests to your location all the time, Uncle Leo.
[01:32:18.380 --> 01:32:19.380]   You're playing the game.
[01:32:19.380 --> 01:32:26.780]   Oh, whoa, I'm playing the game and I don't even know it or maybe I do.
[01:32:26.780 --> 01:32:28.580]   Oh, ha, ha.
[01:32:28.580 --> 01:32:30.220]   Ah, ha.
[01:32:30.220 --> 01:32:32.180]   All right, let's take a little time out.
[01:32:32.180 --> 01:32:34.100]   I'm so confused.
[01:32:34.100 --> 01:32:38.140]   I showed it I brought to you by Stamps.com.
[01:32:38.140 --> 01:32:40.660]   This is a game we've been playing since 2012.

[01:33:13.700 --> 01:33:14.700]   office rates.

[01:33:44.140 --> 01:33:45.140]   You must hate this, Owen.

[01:33:47.340 --> 01:33:48.340]   I love it.

[01:34:55.980 --> 01:34:56.980]   I don't know what I'm going to do now.
[01:34:56.980 --> 01:35:02.500]   I haven't been there since March of 2020.
[01:35:02.500 --> 01:35:03.500]   And it's this big.
[01:35:03.500 --> 01:35:05.700]   It's going to happen.
[01:35:05.700 --> 01:35:10.780]   I'm going to open it and it's going to like a bazooka shoot out at me all the mail that

[01:35:12.820 --> 01:35:15.020]   Anyway, that's another story for another day.
[01:35:15.020 --> 01:35:16.020]   Stamps.com.
[01:35:16.020 --> 01:35:17.020]   I don't need to go to the post office.
[01:35:17.020 --> 01:35:19.780]   I get all the stamps, everything I need right here.
[01:35:19.780 --> 01:35:20.780]   Stamps.com.

[01:35:22.500 --> 01:35:27.420]   I think this would be a good time, give everybody a little bit of a break from this nonstop
[01:35:27.420 --> 01:35:31.420]   action on this show to show you some of the fun that happened during the week here at
[01:35:31.420 --> 01:35:32.420]   TWIT.
[01:35:32.420 --> 01:35:33.420]   Watch.
[01:35:33.420 --> 01:35:38.700]   I'm not crazy about a sleep tracker that uses my noises.
[01:35:38.700 --> 01:35:41.260]   I tape my mouth shut.
[01:35:41.260 --> 01:35:42.260]   So no, it's true.
[01:35:42.260 --> 01:35:46.260]   That was the wrong time to take a drink of water, man.
[01:35:46.260 --> 01:35:49.140]   Previously on TWIT.
[01:35:49.140 --> 01:35:50.460]   Tech News Weekly.
[01:35:50.460 --> 01:35:58.820]   Joseph wrote a story about a way to take advantage of a flaw in SMS.
[01:35:58.820 --> 01:36:05.340]   Hackers are able to take over phone numbers in mere minutes and do it in a way that's
[01:36:05.340 --> 01:36:06.820]   incredibly simple.
[01:36:06.820 --> 01:36:08.540]   Panjon Tech.
[01:36:08.540 --> 01:36:13.700]   I had the honor and pleasure to have a camera sent to me from the folks at Sony and it is
[01:36:13.700 --> 01:36:18.420]   the Sony A7S Mark III.
[01:36:18.420 --> 01:36:19.900]   Windows Weekly.
[01:36:19.900 --> 01:36:22.580]   So we get to talk about Apple.
[01:36:22.580 --> 01:36:26.500]   Could you guys talk about Apple?
[01:36:26.500 --> 01:36:31.140]   What AMD does, what Apple does from a technical standpoint, we look at what they do from a
[01:36:31.140 --> 01:36:34.340]   marketing standpoint or from a product positioning standpoint.
[01:36:34.340 --> 01:36:42.340]   I think an Intel plus Microsoft plus the ecosystem pushing campaign and strive for innovation.
[01:36:42.340 --> 01:36:45.340]   More so than even we had done over the last five years.
[01:36:45.340 --> 01:36:46.860]   This week in Google.
[01:36:46.860 --> 01:36:51.300]   So you tape your mouth shut and you're worried because it sounds weird when you're.
[01:36:51.300 --> 01:36:53.420]   No, there are no sounds anymore.
[01:36:53.420 --> 01:36:54.420]   TWIT.
[01:36:54.420 --> 01:36:57.580]   Lisa says, it's like sleeping with a mind.
[01:36:57.580 --> 01:37:04.580]   It seems like I'm headed towards some sort of bizarre fantasy.
[01:37:04.580 --> 01:37:09.580]   Leo can't get up and he can't scream because his mouth is taped closed.
[01:37:09.580 --> 01:37:14.540]   Oh, if it weren't true, if it were only weren't true.
[01:37:14.540 --> 01:37:15.540]   We've lost her burden.
[01:37:15.540 --> 01:37:16.540]   We lost someone.
[01:37:16.540 --> 01:37:19.140]   Now we can admire his artwork.
[01:37:19.140 --> 01:37:20.740]   Look at, he's got a raccoon.
[01:37:20.740 --> 01:37:21.740]   You mentioned the raccoon.
[01:37:21.740 --> 01:37:25.620]   He has a raccoon on the wall, a little cat and a wolf.
[01:37:25.620 --> 01:37:27.620]   And they're dressed.
[01:37:27.620 --> 01:37:31.180]   Is that a red panda or raccoon?
[01:37:31.180 --> 01:37:32.180]   I think it's a red panda.
[01:37:32.180 --> 01:37:34.660]   I'm like, you know, we'll be able to see them.
[01:37:34.660 --> 01:37:35.660]   They could be very valuable.
[01:37:35.660 --> 01:37:36.660]   Listen, so next week.
[01:37:36.660 --> 01:37:38.980]   You want to be one of the members of the band.
[01:37:38.980 --> 01:37:40.140]   Oh, that's who it is.
[01:37:40.140 --> 01:37:44.940]   It's his fantasy band that he plays with at home.
[01:37:44.940 --> 01:37:48.780]   Oh, oh, it's a zoom background screen grip.
[01:37:48.780 --> 01:37:49.780]   Oh, no.
[01:37:49.780 --> 01:37:50.780]   Oh, shoot.
[01:37:50.780 --> 01:37:51.780]   Hey, Roberto.
[01:37:51.780 --> 01:37:52.780]   Wait a minute.
[01:37:52.780 --> 01:37:53.780]   He's coming back.
[01:37:53.780 --> 01:37:54.780]   Can you get out of the shot again?
[01:37:54.780 --> 01:37:56.860]   We want to just shoot that for a screen background for everybody to use it.
[01:37:56.860 --> 01:37:58.580]   There's zoom on their zoom shot.
[01:37:58.580 --> 01:37:59.580]   Okay.
[01:37:59.580 --> 01:38:01.380]   Quickly screen grab that.
[01:38:01.380 --> 01:38:02.380]   Okay, perfect.
[01:38:02.380 --> 01:38:05.980]   There is a strange shadow there, but that's okay.
[01:38:05.980 --> 01:38:08.900]   I mean, we were asking you about the paintings.
[01:38:08.900 --> 01:38:11.020]   So is that a raccoon or a red panda?
[01:38:11.020 --> 01:38:17.820]   So there's a red panda and his cat and then a coyote and this painting was right here.
[01:38:17.820 --> 01:38:19.780]   Oh, she's good.
[01:38:19.780 --> 01:38:20.780]   I love it.
[01:38:20.780 --> 01:38:26.740]   And then she makes I'm in her office because I don't I don't have the router and everything
[01:38:26.740 --> 01:38:27.740]   is in her office.
[01:38:27.740 --> 01:38:28.740]   Yeah, that's my office.
[01:38:28.740 --> 01:38:30.540]   There's like a big.
[01:38:30.540 --> 01:38:31.540]   There's a bunch of other stuff.
[01:38:31.540 --> 01:38:32.940]   I love I love the art though.
[01:38:32.940 --> 01:38:35.300]   Did she do the red panda and the raccoon or is it?
[01:38:35.300 --> 01:38:38.540]   No, these are these are their watercolors are beautiful.
[01:38:38.540 --> 01:38:45.180]   Yeah, these are from a somehow she found like them them small somewhere and then I found
[01:38:45.180 --> 01:38:47.780]   a calendar with all of these.
[01:38:47.780 --> 01:38:50.580]   And so I bought her to calendar so she could cut them out and put them on the wall.
[01:38:50.580 --> 01:38:52.940]   At first, I thought they might be crypto punks.
[01:38:52.940 --> 01:38:55.700]   You know what those are speaking of NFTs.
[01:38:55.700 --> 01:39:01.940]   They were one of the first there eight bit kind of icon sized drawings that are now you
[01:39:01.940 --> 01:39:05.020]   could have picked up for a song when they first came out some years ago.
[01:39:05.020 --> 01:39:09.100]   They're now worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, but they're they're digital.
[01:39:09.100 --> 01:39:12.020]   So the reason I bring that up next week, Kevin Rose is going to be on.
[01:39:12.020 --> 01:39:17.140]   He's just launched a new podcast called modern finance mofai.net and the very first episode
[01:39:17.140 --> 01:39:23.420]   they talked about this whole weird collectible thing.
[01:39:23.420 --> 01:39:28.820]   And he's talking about like I had 30 crypto punks, but I decided I wanted to sell them and
[01:39:28.820 --> 01:39:33.500]   just really focus on one really valuable crypto punk.
[01:39:33.500 --> 01:39:39.780]   So I got the smiling zombie, which is apparently worth like a hundred thousand dollars.
[01:39:39.780 --> 01:39:41.340]   This is what they look like.
[01:39:41.340 --> 01:39:42.340]   This is nuts.
[01:39:42.340 --> 01:39:43.340]   There's you don't own.
[01:39:43.340 --> 01:39:44.460]   I mean, you own it.
[01:39:44.460 --> 01:39:46.220]   It's yours officially.
[01:39:46.220 --> 01:39:48.780]   Yeah, but there's no there's nothing to hang on the wall.
[01:39:48.780 --> 01:39:50.620]   I guess you could print it out, but so could anybody.
[01:39:50.620 --> 01:39:54.020]   I could put these out, put it on the wall.
[01:39:54.020 --> 01:39:55.020]   Huh.
[01:39:55.020 --> 01:39:56.020]   Interesting, isn't it?
[01:39:56.020 --> 01:39:57.980]   And then you sell them to others.
[01:39:57.980 --> 01:40:00.660]   That's the theory, right?
[01:40:00.660 --> 01:40:05.100]   It's talking about how a lot of times nowadays when people buy fine art, you know, Van Gogh's
[01:40:05.100 --> 01:40:10.660]   or Picasso's, they never even take them out of the airport.
[01:40:10.660 --> 01:40:11.660]   They store them.
[01:40:11.660 --> 01:40:12.660]   The taxes.
[01:40:12.660 --> 01:40:13.660]   Yeah.
[01:40:13.660 --> 01:40:14.740]   And the taxes even.
[01:40:14.740 --> 01:40:17.860]   They're not buying it for the to put it on the wall.
[01:40:17.860 --> 01:40:18.860]   They're buying it as a vestments.
[01:40:18.860 --> 01:40:23.140]   So they just keep it in special storage facilities at the airport.
[01:40:23.140 --> 01:40:26.380]   So they never have to pay the customs of the taxes.
[01:40:26.380 --> 01:40:27.980]   And it's still just as good as selling it.
[01:40:27.980 --> 01:40:32.100]   I guess it's kind of the same as I've got money in the bank, but is there money anywhere?
[01:40:32.100 --> 01:40:33.300]   There's no money in the bank.
[01:40:33.300 --> 01:40:35.700]   It's just it's crypto crypto.
[01:40:35.700 --> 01:40:36.820]   So I don't know if that it's money.
[01:40:36.820 --> 01:40:39.380]   I mean, again, I fully understand it.
[01:40:39.380 --> 01:40:42.420]   And as much as it's a scam, it's a real thing because it's just like anything else.
[01:40:42.420 --> 01:40:46.780]   Like we just said, fine art has a value because people put value on it.
[01:40:46.780 --> 01:40:47.780]   Yeah.
[01:40:47.780 --> 01:40:48.780]   Yeah.
[01:40:48.780 --> 01:40:49.780]   It's just the way it is.
[01:40:49.780 --> 01:40:52.580]   Like, you know, crypto's a joke 10 years ago.
[01:40:52.580 --> 01:40:55.300]   Now it's like, oh, everybody's clamoring to get like, okay, well, now it's got enough
[01:40:55.300 --> 01:40:58.740]   people that back it's where you don't have to worry about it going to zero unless you're
[01:40:58.740 --> 01:40:59.740]   chasing Calcana.
[01:40:59.740 --> 01:41:01.660]   So these things are going to go to zero every day.
[01:41:01.660 --> 01:41:08.620]   Is that his position on crypto is his positions very fluid and it's a weird position on crypto.
[01:41:08.620 --> 01:41:09.620]   He says things like that.
[01:41:09.620 --> 01:41:10.620]   Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[01:41:10.620 --> 01:41:11.620]   We never know.
[01:41:11.620 --> 01:41:12.620]   You never know.
[01:41:12.620 --> 01:41:13.620]   My good to zero.
[01:41:13.620 --> 01:41:14.620]   You know, good.
[01:41:14.620 --> 01:41:15.620]   It could.
[01:41:15.620 --> 01:41:16.620]   I mean, everything a good is zero.
[01:41:16.620 --> 01:41:17.620]   Right.
[01:41:17.620 --> 01:41:18.620]   The dollar could go to zero.
[01:41:18.620 --> 01:41:19.620]   The value of the dollar could go down the zero.
[01:41:19.620 --> 01:41:20.620]   The value of gold could go down the zero.
[01:41:20.620 --> 01:41:21.620]   You'd be in a vineyard Germany.
[01:41:21.620 --> 01:41:22.620]   Right.
[01:41:22.620 --> 01:41:23.980]   The value of oil went down the low zero.
[01:41:23.980 --> 01:41:24.980]   It was below zero.
[01:41:24.980 --> 01:41:25.980]   It's below zero.
[01:41:25.980 --> 01:41:26.980]   Yeah.
[01:41:26.980 --> 01:41:28.980]   I believe March or April of last year.
[01:41:28.980 --> 01:41:29.980]   So yeah.
[01:41:29.980 --> 01:41:30.980]   Yeah.
[01:41:30.980 --> 01:41:31.980]   Yeah.
[01:41:31.980 --> 01:41:35.100]   That is the key.
[01:41:35.100 --> 01:41:36.100]   What is the key?
[01:41:36.100 --> 01:41:38.100]   Never go to a second location.
[01:41:38.100 --> 01:41:39.100]   Is that the key?
[01:41:39.100 --> 01:41:40.100]   Everybody a second location.
[01:41:40.100 --> 01:41:41.100]   Okay.
[01:41:41.100 --> 01:41:46.940]   Kind of feel like I'm a novice walking with masters.
[01:41:46.940 --> 01:41:49.300]   Oh, oh, oh, oh, sensei.
[01:41:49.300 --> 01:41:52.220]   Oh, talk to sensei.
[01:41:52.220 --> 01:41:53.940]   Oh, oh.
[01:41:53.940 --> 01:41:54.940]   Great.
[01:41:54.940 --> 01:41:55.940]   Georgia.
[01:41:55.940 --> 01:41:57.620]   Teach me tonight.
[01:41:57.620 --> 01:42:02.380]   A hacker got all my texts, writes Joseph Cox for $16.
[01:42:02.380 --> 01:42:07.900]   Now he paid the hacker to do it, but this is if you ever needed a reason to say I will
[01:42:07.900 --> 01:42:12.380]   never again use SMS for two factor authentication.
[01:42:12.380 --> 01:42:13.540]   This is it.
[01:42:13.540 --> 01:42:15.980]   What a chilling story this is.
[01:42:15.980 --> 01:42:22.340]   He hired a hacker for his purposes of the story effectively to hack him.
[01:42:22.340 --> 01:42:26.740]   Now normally we talk about sim swapping where a hacker will call your phone company and
[01:42:26.740 --> 01:42:28.380]   say, hey, it's Leo.
[01:42:28.380 --> 01:42:29.380]   I lost my phone.
[01:42:29.380 --> 01:42:30.900]   Can you send me a new sim?
[01:42:30.900 --> 01:42:32.500]   Yeah, sure.
[01:42:32.500 --> 01:42:33.500]   What's your address?
[01:42:33.500 --> 01:42:34.500]   Will I moved?
[01:42:34.500 --> 01:42:37.140]   I now live at Sing Sing.
[01:42:37.140 --> 01:42:38.740]   That's in us in New York.
[01:42:38.740 --> 01:42:40.340]   I mean, cell black 43.
[01:42:40.340 --> 01:42:41.340]   Okay.
[01:42:41.340 --> 01:42:42.900]   We'll send that sim right away to you.
[01:42:42.900 --> 01:42:47.100]   And then they have your phone number and all the texts go to them.
[01:42:47.100 --> 01:42:50.660]   So your SMS authentication goes to them.
[01:42:50.660 --> 01:42:52.860]   And you're done.
[01:42:52.860 --> 01:42:54.980]   This is so much easier.
[01:42:54.980 --> 01:42:56.100]   This is so much simpler.
[01:42:56.100 --> 01:43:02.540]   So he hired a guy lucky 225, which by the way, if you're a hacker, that's a nice name.
[01:43:02.540 --> 01:43:06.660]   He's a white hat, I guess hacker or we don't say white hat anymore, do we?
[01:43:06.660 --> 01:43:08.260]   He's a good guy hacker.
[01:43:08.260 --> 01:43:10.260]   Can I say that?
[01:43:10.260 --> 01:43:11.740]   We call him security researchers now.
[01:43:11.740 --> 01:43:14.500]   He's a security researcher.
[01:43:14.500 --> 01:43:17.220]   What he did, he went to a company.
[01:43:17.220 --> 01:43:20.700]   And by the way, I'll mention the company's name, but it's not really the company's fault.
[01:43:20.700 --> 01:43:23.180]   There are lots of companies that do this.
[01:43:23.180 --> 01:43:29.220]   He went to a company that helps businesses called, they're called Sakari helps businesses
[01:43:29.220 --> 01:43:31.740]   send and receive text messages to customers.
[01:43:31.740 --> 01:43:35.020]   S-A-K-A-R-I.
[01:43:35.020 --> 01:43:39.540]   They have a trial plan for $16 a month.
[01:43:39.540 --> 01:43:43.900]   And of course, you need to give them the number that you want to send and receive messages
[01:43:43.900 --> 01:43:45.100]   from, right?
[01:43:45.100 --> 01:43:50.140]   Because they basically goes to them and then they send it along to you.
[01:43:50.140 --> 01:43:51.780]   How do you get this number?
[01:43:51.780 --> 01:43:56.700]   You send them a letter of authorization saying, yeah, I own this number.
[01:43:56.700 --> 01:43:58.620]   Can be completely forged.
[01:43:58.620 --> 01:44:03.500]   They even very kindly give you online the letter of authorization to sign.
[01:44:03.500 --> 01:44:06.420]   Apparently, they do no verification.
[01:44:06.420 --> 01:44:09.340]   Lucky 225 paid the 16 bucks.
[01:44:09.340 --> 01:44:14.940]   And now he's getting all of Cox's texts sent to him as well as, by the way, Cox never
[01:44:14.940 --> 01:44:19.740]   notices this because it's also being sent to his phone as usual.
[01:44:19.740 --> 01:44:23.620]   All you need is this letter of authorization.
[01:44:23.620 --> 01:44:24.620]   And that's it.
[01:44:24.620 --> 01:44:28.980]   Why doesn't it give you that stupid thing I get in the email that says, you have been
[01:44:28.980 --> 01:44:33.500]   signed into a new device and your texts are being shared with another device?
[01:44:33.500 --> 01:44:36.540]   It should say that.
[01:44:36.540 --> 01:44:38.860]   There's no, there's no who owns SMS.
[01:44:38.860 --> 01:44:40.700]   It's up to the individual phone company.
[01:44:40.700 --> 01:44:43.540]   This is why the SS7 exploit is such a big deal.
[01:44:43.540 --> 01:44:49.420]   And that's the SS7 exploit was why, you know, Jack Dorsey got his, his Twitter account
[01:44:49.420 --> 01:44:54.260]   hack and that's why they turned off SMS tweets because Jack was hacked.
[01:44:54.260 --> 01:44:57.980]   Not because they, not because it's been a problem for years.
[01:44:57.980 --> 01:45:02.380]   That's why as soon as Jack tweets something that or someone finds a tweet from 10 years
[01:45:02.380 --> 01:45:06.620]   ago and uses it to call him out, that's where we're going to do that.
[01:45:06.620 --> 01:45:07.620]   Oh, yeah.
[01:45:07.620 --> 01:45:08.620]   That's where we fix that.
[01:45:08.620 --> 01:45:11.580]   Good lead to the lead tweets, you know, that are over a month old.
[01:45:11.580 --> 01:45:14.180]   You know, that's the privilege of owning your own company.
[01:45:14.180 --> 01:45:16.700]   I suppose Sakari is going to change how this works.
[01:45:16.700 --> 01:45:21.700]   I hope these other companies, apparently there are many that do this.
[01:45:21.700 --> 01:45:24.540]   Unfortunately, you may not have a choice.
[01:45:24.540 --> 01:45:30.060]   For instance, my bank and I think most banks, that's how they send the two factor authentication.
[01:45:30.060 --> 01:45:34.540]   They send it via SMS and you could beg and plead and say, I'll never use you again,
[01:45:34.540 --> 01:45:37.340]   but good luck finding a bank that doesn't have that.
[01:45:37.340 --> 01:45:38.340]   Yeah.
[01:45:38.340 --> 01:45:41.020]   And in some places, I mean, if you can use an authenticator, use it.
[01:45:41.020 --> 01:45:43.620]   But it's also, this is a targeted attack.
[01:45:43.620 --> 01:45:47.460]   You always have to take into account that most of these attacks are targeted attacks.
[01:45:47.460 --> 01:45:53.220]   If you're a CEO, if you're a journalist, if you're a human rights, you're someone who
[01:45:53.220 --> 01:45:57.900]   protests human rights, or you're even if you're a female, that's also a target attack.
[01:45:57.900 --> 01:46:00.940]   If any, you know, ex boyfriend going after you.
[01:46:00.940 --> 01:46:01.940]   Yeah.
[01:46:01.940 --> 01:46:05.380]   You know, you have any sort of issue in your life where you think someone is going to be
[01:46:05.380 --> 01:46:06.540]   targeting.
[01:46:06.540 --> 01:46:10.700]   That's when you have to really be careful with your online accounts.
[01:46:10.700 --> 01:46:13.220]   That's a good point because this is not a mass attack.
[01:46:13.220 --> 01:46:14.220]   This is against one.
[01:46:14.220 --> 01:46:15.220]   Yeah.
[01:46:15.220 --> 01:46:16.220]   It's not a bad.
[01:46:16.220 --> 01:46:17.220]   Yeah.
[01:46:17.220 --> 01:46:18.220]   Yeah.
[01:46:18.220 --> 01:46:20.140]   It's someone had to, you know, someone targeted this individual because he asked him to.
[01:46:20.140 --> 01:46:21.140]   Right.
[01:46:21.140 --> 01:46:22.300]   The average person isn't getting targeted.
[01:46:22.300 --> 01:46:27.900]   The average person isn't, you know, doesn't have to worry about this attack, but try to
[01:46:27.900 --> 01:46:29.300]   use an authenticator.
[01:46:29.300 --> 01:46:31.100]   Microsoft makes one couple of other companies.
[01:46:31.100 --> 01:46:32.100]   Yeah.
[01:46:32.100 --> 01:46:34.820]   And we say that and I think our audience knows enough to do that, but that's a problem
[01:46:34.820 --> 01:46:39.660]   is there are still and especially banks for some, maybe because their customers aren't
[01:46:39.660 --> 01:46:44.540]   sophisticated, there's still lots of institutions, financial institutions, especially that use
[01:46:44.540 --> 01:46:45.540]   text messages.
[01:46:45.540 --> 01:46:46.540]   Yeah.
[01:46:46.540 --> 01:46:52.100]   And if you have, if you're rich, then you should really, you know, figure out some other, you
[01:46:52.100 --> 01:46:54.980]   know, especially if you're rich, you can tell the bank to do whatever they want.
[01:46:54.980 --> 01:46:55.980]   You know, do this.
[01:46:55.980 --> 01:47:00.460]   I'm rich or as opposed to me who's not rich until the banks up and are like, whatever.
[01:47:00.460 --> 01:47:01.460]   Go to Citibank.
[01:47:01.460 --> 01:47:02.460]   We don't care.
[01:47:02.460 --> 01:47:03.460]   Yeah.
[01:47:03.460 --> 01:47:04.460]   So if I'm rich, I should do that.
[01:47:04.460 --> 01:47:05.460]   And I should never walk, right?
[01:47:05.460 --> 01:47:06.460]   I should, I should bring my car.
[01:47:06.460 --> 01:47:07.460]   Never walk.
[01:47:07.460 --> 01:47:08.460]   Never walk.
[01:47:08.460 --> 01:47:09.460]   Never walk.
[01:47:09.460 --> 01:47:11.500]   Never walk to a second location.
[01:47:11.500 --> 01:47:12.980]   Never walk to a second location.
[01:47:12.980 --> 01:47:14.700]   Have your car bring you there.
[01:47:14.700 --> 01:47:15.700]   Yes.
[01:47:15.700 --> 01:47:16.700]   Exactly.
[01:47:16.700 --> 01:47:17.700]   Okay.
[01:47:17.700 --> 01:47:18.780]   I'm, I'm learning here.
[01:47:18.780 --> 01:47:21.940]   You remember it was actually in the middle of a show this happened during this week in
[01:47:21.940 --> 01:47:28.620]   Google last year, all of a sudden we're seeing tweets from Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Jack
[01:47:28.620 --> 01:47:35.900]   Dorsey, Apple saying, I've decided to, to give back to my community.
[01:47:35.900 --> 01:47:40.020]   So for the next 30 minutes, if you send me any amount of Bitcoin, I'll double it and
[01:47:40.020 --> 01:47:42.100]   send it back to you.
[01:47:42.100 --> 01:47:45.940]   It kind of have to be an idiot to fall for that.
[01:47:45.940 --> 01:47:50.220]   It was very obvious Twitter had been severely hacked.
[01:47:50.220 --> 01:47:52.340]   We're, we're saying what's going on here.
[01:47:52.340 --> 01:47:56.420]   I mean, first of all, if you were able to post on anybody's account that you wanted to
[01:47:56.420 --> 01:47:58.300]   and that seemed like it was apparent.
[01:47:58.300 --> 01:48:04.380]   Barack Obama, Elon Musk, Kanye West, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Mike Bloomberg, Warren Buffett,
[01:48:04.380 --> 01:48:12.100]   Floyd Mayweather, Kim Kardashian, Apple and Uber, if you can do that, you got the nuclear
[01:48:12.100 --> 01:48:13.100]   option.
[01:48:13.100 --> 01:48:17.580]   Go first, do something, you know, say, uh, I don't know what, but it seems like asking
[01:48:17.580 --> 01:48:23.780]   for Bitcoin is the, is the least we thought either this is very a clever ploy to distract
[01:48:23.780 --> 01:48:25.300]   or this guy is a kid.
[01:48:25.300 --> 01:48:31.980]   Turns out it was a kid, a 17 year old high school student who had basically got the hack
[01:48:31.980 --> 01:48:40.060]   by, uh, convincing a Twitter employee that he was with Twitter IT and he got the guy
[01:48:40.060 --> 01:48:45.660]   to give him, we think his slack handle, his slack login, the kid logged into his slack
[01:48:45.660 --> 01:48:52.100]   and lo and behold, Twitter had posted pendant in fact, the credentials for the Twitter customer
[01:48:52.100 --> 01:48:57.180]   service portal, which gave you access to all these people's accounts and the ability to
[01:48:57.180 --> 01:49:00.620]   tweet on their behalf, that's what the kid did with it.
[01:49:00.620 --> 01:49:02.660]   He was caught like within a day.
[01:49:02.660 --> 01:49:06.980]   I'm not going to say his name because he, again, this is something he did as a Ute at
[01:49:06.980 --> 01:49:07.980]   17.
[01:49:07.980 --> 01:49:10.020]   Uh, he has been convicted now.
[01:49:10.020 --> 01:49:15.380]   If it had, if he'd been trying it as adult would have been 10 years minimum, minimum,
[01:49:15.380 --> 01:49:21.860]   but he was tried as a, as a Ute and he, uh, is going to get three years in juvie, basically
[01:49:21.860 --> 01:49:30.580]   a, a prison designed for youthful offenders, like a boot camp, military style boot camp.
[01:49:30.580 --> 01:49:40.620]   Uh, so this great threat to our national security is no longer, uh, going to, he's going to
[01:49:40.620 --> 01:49:44.020]   a second location actually is what's happening.
[01:49:44.020 --> 01:49:49.420]   Well, I mean, it shows, I mean, there was, I, I saw a talk with Kevin, Kevin, it's a very
[01:49:49.420 --> 01:49:50.420]   famous, we know Kevin.
[01:49:50.420 --> 01:49:52.740]   Um, hacker, yeah, everyone knows Kevin and McNich.
[01:49:52.740 --> 01:49:57.100]   Um, he talked about how his company, you know, they do pen testing, which is they try to
[01:49:57.100 --> 01:50:00.620]   break in the companies, the companies pay them to try to break in.
[01:50:00.620 --> 01:50:04.380]   And if it's just technology based, you know, they have, sometimes it works, sometimes it
[01:50:04.380 --> 01:50:07.700]   doesn't, but he said if it, their social engineering involved, and this is where you
[01:50:07.700 --> 01:50:11.900]   talk somebody into giving you information, they can, his company can get in a hundred
[01:50:11.900 --> 01:50:12.900]   percent of the time.
[01:50:12.900 --> 01:50:15.540]   Um, you know, wrote the book on social engineering.
[01:50:15.540 --> 01:50:16.540]   Yeah.
[01:50:16.540 --> 01:50:17.540]   Actually.
[01:50:17.540 --> 01:50:20.140]   Matt Hohnen's like huge hack that happened back when we were both working at Wired.
[01:50:20.140 --> 01:50:23.940]   That was all social engineering that the person did with Amazon and with Apple.
[01:50:23.940 --> 01:50:28.940]   And it's, you, you just keep trying and you create these scripts in order to get through
[01:50:28.940 --> 01:50:31.820]   these certain like get past individuals.
[01:50:31.820 --> 01:50:36.260]   And it's, it's really, if you could just talk people into doing something and sharing
[01:50:36.260 --> 01:50:42.420]   what feels like, you know, information that's not that important with a, with a third party,
[01:50:42.420 --> 01:50:44.940]   turns out that information is very important and it's used.
[01:50:44.940 --> 01:50:48.660]   It's part of a, you know, a puzzle to get into accounts.
[01:50:48.660 --> 01:50:52.020]   And the fact that, you know, it was a kid as opposed to a nation state, a nation state
[01:50:52.020 --> 01:50:55.420]   could have put something on, they could have gotten, they could have gotten to Donald Trump's
[01:50:55.420 --> 01:50:59.860]   thing and said, we're nuking, you know, show or India or start a little more.
[01:50:59.860 --> 01:51:04.420]   If you had Elon Musk, look what Elon Musk has done to the value of Bitcoin, to the value
[01:51:04.420 --> 01:51:06.540]   of Tesla stock with his own tweets.
[01:51:06.540 --> 01:51:10.940]   If you had Elon Musk's account, buy some Tesla stock and make an announcement.
[01:51:10.940 --> 01:51:14.340]   There was ways to make millions of dollars, but he's a kid.
[01:51:14.340 --> 01:51:15.340]   He's 17 year old.
[01:51:15.340 --> 01:51:16.340]   He's a kid.
[01:51:16.340 --> 01:51:17.340]   He's in high school.
[01:51:17.340 --> 01:51:18.340]   He didn't cover his, he didn't cover his tracks.
[01:51:18.340 --> 01:51:20.100]   He got busted right away.
[01:51:20.100 --> 01:51:21.100]   Yeah.
[01:51:21.100 --> 01:51:24.180]   He got a ridiculous, you know, he had a ridiculous idea as a smart kid.
[01:51:24.180 --> 01:51:27.940]   And actually, I'm going to get the feds a lot of credit because they could have thrown
[01:51:27.940 --> 01:51:28.940]   the book at him.
[01:51:28.940 --> 01:51:30.180]   They could have put him in jail for 10 years.
[01:51:30.180 --> 01:51:33.780]   They decided to try him in a state court instead of a federal court because they had
[01:51:33.780 --> 01:51:36.580]   more flexibility to try him as a juvenile.
[01:51:36.580 --> 01:51:42.340]   So they actually, I think they were intentionally pretty nice to this kid and get this, by the
[01:51:42.340 --> 01:51:46.540]   way, of course, he gave out a Bitcoin address and you can look at any Bitcoin address and
[01:51:46.540 --> 01:51:48.700]   see how much money came in.
[01:51:48.700 --> 01:51:49.700]   That's right.
[01:51:49.700 --> 01:51:50.980]   About $117,000.
[01:51:50.980 --> 01:51:55.620]   It wasn't, it wasn't exactly a giant successful windfall.
[01:51:55.620 --> 01:51:56.940]   Windfall, you know.
[01:51:56.940 --> 01:51:57.940]   Yeah.
[01:51:57.940 --> 01:52:02.760]   It's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, what would you do if you had Elon or Kanye's or Kim
[01:52:02.760 --> 01:52:08.020]   Kardashian's or Bill Gates Twitter, it seemed Jeff Bezos is, seems like you could say something
[01:52:08.020 --> 01:52:10.300]   that would have be of huge material value.
[01:52:10.300 --> 01:52:13.060]   Jeff Bezos could say, Hey, don't look now.
[01:52:13.060 --> 01:52:18.140]   The next time we announce our quarterly results, you're going to be blown away.
[01:52:18.140 --> 01:52:24.100]   And of course you buy this stock before you tweet that and profit seems like, well, I
[01:52:24.100 --> 01:52:25.100]   mean, it's an S.E.
[01:52:25.100 --> 01:52:28.700]   First, but you don't care about that, right?
[01:52:28.700 --> 01:52:29.700]   Yeah.
[01:52:29.700 --> 01:52:32.700]   I mean, how do they, how do they keep track of who's buying and who's selling stock, especially
[01:52:32.700 --> 01:52:35.180]   if you buy the stock a month ahead of time.
[01:52:35.180 --> 01:52:36.620]   Then you pull this off.
[01:52:36.620 --> 01:52:37.620]   He could have done so much.
[01:52:37.620 --> 01:52:38.620]   Yeah.
[01:52:38.620 --> 01:52:40.340]   He just decided to have some fun.
[01:52:40.340 --> 01:52:41.340]   You could have.
[01:52:41.340 --> 01:52:45.100]   He could have done something good instead of doing it just for himself.
[01:52:45.100 --> 01:52:47.100]   Like, you know, Jeff Bezos was like, guess what?
[01:52:47.100 --> 01:52:51.260]   We're giving, you know, everyone's getting whatever $15 an hour plus all kind of things.
[01:52:51.260 --> 01:52:52.260]   Oh, wouldn't that be awesome?
[01:52:52.260 --> 01:52:53.420]   All going to be unionized.
[01:52:53.420 --> 01:52:54.940]   And then everyone's excited.
[01:52:54.940 --> 01:52:56.660]   There's a whole bunch of articles out about it.
[01:52:56.660 --> 01:53:00.060]   And then he has to kind of decide if he's going to backtrack or not.
[01:53:00.060 --> 01:53:04.580]   If he said before he says that short the stock because you know, everybody's going to be excited,
[01:53:04.580 --> 01:53:08.420]   but the stock market's going to punish Amazon for that, right?
[01:53:08.420 --> 01:53:09.860]   That's why they don't do it.
[01:53:09.860 --> 01:53:13.780]   So short the stock then do it or just say everybody should buy GameStop.
[01:53:13.780 --> 01:53:15.540]   I think it's going places.
[01:53:15.540 --> 01:53:20.580]   At GameStop, you know, the place you bought a game at five years ago.
[01:53:20.580 --> 01:53:24.260]   Actually, I am not going to knock GameStop.
[01:53:24.260 --> 01:53:25.580]   We have an 18 year old.
[01:53:25.580 --> 01:53:31.020]   His one deepest desire in all of life was a PlayStation 5.
[01:53:31.020 --> 01:53:34.940]   We I promised him one his birthday was November 26th, right?
[01:53:34.940 --> 01:53:36.940]   And I said, we're going to get you a PlayStation 5.
[01:53:36.940 --> 01:53:42.940]   And I have been I have been banging on every retailer every week trying to get a PlayStation
[01:53:42.940 --> 01:53:43.940]   5.
[01:53:43.940 --> 01:53:45.220]   Uncle, Uncle Leo.
[01:53:45.220 --> 01:53:53.340]   See, this again is where you upset me by Tesla and you don't have it drives you.
[01:53:53.340 --> 01:53:54.340]   Okay.
[01:53:54.340 --> 01:53:55.340]   Yeah.
[01:53:55.340 --> 01:53:57.500]   You're the child wants a PS5.
[01:53:57.500 --> 01:54:00.540]   If you don't buy him a PS5 today, I'll be in range with you.
[01:54:00.540 --> 01:54:02.500]   We got we got a PS5.
[01:54:02.500 --> 01:54:03.500]   That's that's the.
[01:54:03.500 --> 01:54:07.700]   No, you're saying I should have got spent a thousand bucks on eBay and one one.
[01:54:07.700 --> 01:54:08.700]   Yes.
[01:54:08.700 --> 01:54:09.700]   Yes.
[01:54:09.700 --> 01:54:10.700]   Oh, that hurts me.
[01:54:10.700 --> 01:54:12.060]   I'm so didn't have a job to you.
[01:54:12.060 --> 01:54:13.420]   You're obviously burning cash.
[01:54:13.420 --> 01:54:20.500]   That's a lovely mother who can't afford to PS5 who said, let me buy one double my money
[01:54:20.500 --> 01:54:21.900]   and get another one on my top.
[01:54:21.900 --> 01:54:28.220]   I got a list because he got a tip that GameStop had stock.
[01:54:28.220 --> 01:54:29.860]   He ran over there.
[01:54:29.860 --> 01:54:31.660]   He said, Mom, give me your credit card.
[01:54:31.660 --> 01:54:32.660]   He ran over there.
[01:54:32.660 --> 01:54:33.660]   You got it.
[01:54:33.660 --> 01:54:39.260]   You got it at MSRP yet a buy a bundle, but he wanted Call of Duty and Spider-Man anyway.
[01:54:39.260 --> 01:54:40.780]   I have to say it is your right.
[01:54:40.780 --> 01:54:45.380]   Oh, and cause it's ending up being expensive because I stupidly said, but you're watching
[01:54:45.380 --> 01:54:46.460]   it on a 1080p.
[01:54:46.460 --> 01:54:48.940]   You really need a 4K TV.
[01:54:48.940 --> 01:54:53.020]   Not only did you get them a 4K 120 Hertz because let me tell you something.
[01:54:53.020 --> 01:54:54.900]   Me and my daughter are playing PS5, right?
[01:54:54.900 --> 01:55:00.500]   We're playing it on my 55 inch Samsung ball and TV 4K.
[01:55:00.500 --> 01:55:05.780]   I went and got the new Samsung 90T 120 Hertz and my daughter looked at me.
[01:55:05.780 --> 01:55:07.540]   She's like, this is a PS5.
[01:55:07.540 --> 01:55:09.500]   This is different.
[01:55:09.500 --> 01:55:10.820]   It makes a huge difference.
[01:55:10.820 --> 01:55:11.820]   Wait a minute.
[01:55:11.820 --> 01:55:12.820]   Wait a minute.
[01:55:12.820 --> 01:55:14.020]   You're saying I got a 60 Hertz.
[01:55:14.020 --> 01:55:16.020]   I should have gotten 120 Hertz.
[01:55:16.020 --> 01:55:17.180]   It's 120 Hertz.
[01:55:17.180 --> 01:55:18.180]   Don't come on baby.
[01:55:18.180 --> 01:55:23.020]   You're the tech guy, but I'm the knowledge you got.
[01:55:23.020 --> 01:55:24.820]   I need to be Lisa.
[01:55:24.820 --> 01:55:26.700]   Lisa, I know you can hear the sound of my voice.
[01:55:26.700 --> 01:55:28.860]   Allow me to be on Twitter after dark.
[01:55:28.860 --> 01:55:29.860]   I'm working remotely now.
[01:55:29.860 --> 01:55:31.140]   It doesn't matter from across the country.
[01:55:31.140 --> 01:55:32.340]   Let me be on Twitter after dark.
[01:55:32.340 --> 01:55:37.740]   From 12 o'clock to one o'clock, I will give advice on things to buy life technology, life
[01:55:37.740 --> 01:55:38.740]   kids, all kinds of things.
[01:55:38.740 --> 01:55:39.740]   You got it.
[01:55:39.740 --> 01:55:40.740]   You want to do it?
[01:55:40.740 --> 01:55:41.740]   It's yours.
[01:55:41.740 --> 01:55:45.060]   You got 120 Hertz TV for 120 Hertz device.
[01:55:45.060 --> 01:55:48.780]   The case, the ACB I can't believe gave you is 420 Hertz, them five babies.
[01:55:48.780 --> 01:55:49.780]   All right.
[01:55:49.780 --> 01:55:50.780]   I'm going to go online and cancel it.
[01:55:50.780 --> 01:55:53.100]   I'm going to buy if I could find it.
[01:55:53.100 --> 01:55:54.460]   I got them a cheap TCL.
[01:55:54.460 --> 01:55:57.580]   I probably should have gotten them some fancy.
[01:55:57.580 --> 01:55:58.580]   Let's get them a Samsung.
[01:55:58.580 --> 01:55:59.580]   Okay.
[01:55:59.580 --> 01:56:02.860]   You can get them a 60 T or a 70 T if you feel like you love to kid, which I think you do.
[01:56:02.860 --> 01:56:05.420]   You can give them a 70 T 120 Hertz.
[01:56:05.420 --> 01:56:06.420]   Okay.
[01:56:06.420 --> 01:56:07.420]   That's a 2019 TV.
[01:56:07.420 --> 01:56:08.420]   Come on, Uncle Leo.
[01:56:08.420 --> 01:56:09.420]   Come on.
[01:56:09.420 --> 01:56:10.420]   120 Hertz.
[01:56:10.420 --> 01:56:12.220]   You got your car driving you.
[01:56:12.220 --> 01:56:15.420]   I think he's trying to cancel it now.
[01:56:15.420 --> 01:56:17.620]   I am trying to cancel it now.
[01:56:17.620 --> 01:56:23.100]   You've done some good Owen.
[01:56:23.100 --> 01:56:25.060]   You've done some good.
[01:56:25.060 --> 01:56:26.060]   Is this it?
[01:56:26.060 --> 01:56:34.020]   QLEQ 70 T 4K dual LED quantum HDR smart TV with Alexa built in this one?
[01:56:34.020 --> 01:56:35.020]   Is that the 120 Hertz?
[01:56:35.020 --> 01:56:36.020]   I don't know.
[01:56:36.020 --> 01:56:37.020]   How about you?
[01:56:37.020 --> 01:56:38.020]   Yeah.
[01:56:38.020 --> 01:56:39.020]   Yeah.
[01:56:39.020 --> 01:56:41.020]   Native refresh rate 120 Hertz.
[01:56:41.020 --> 01:56:42.020]   Yeah.
[01:56:42.020 --> 01:56:44.020]   The 70 T is the one that starts with 120 Hertz.
[01:56:44.020 --> 01:56:45.020]   Go ahead.
[01:56:45.020 --> 01:56:46.020]   Get them in that bad boy.
[01:56:46.020 --> 01:56:47.020]   Yeah.
[01:56:47.020 --> 01:56:48.020]   I mean, go ahead.
[01:56:48.020 --> 01:56:49.020]   All right.
[01:56:49.020 --> 01:56:50.020]   All right.
[01:56:50.020 --> 01:56:51.020]   All right.
[01:56:51.020 --> 01:56:52.020]   All right.
[01:56:52.020 --> 01:56:53.020]   You want to ball out, Uncle Leo.
[01:56:53.020 --> 01:56:54.020]   Yeah.
[01:56:54.020 --> 01:56:55.020]   55 big enough.
[01:56:55.020 --> 01:56:56.020]   I don't need to get a 65.
[01:56:56.020 --> 01:56:57.020]   Yeah.
[01:56:57.020 --> 01:56:58.020]   Yeah.
[01:56:58.020 --> 01:56:59.020]   So you're going to get the CLC ABC crap.
[01:56:59.020 --> 01:57:00.020]   You're going to get them.
[01:57:00.020 --> 01:57:01.020]   Oh.
[01:57:01.020 --> 01:57:02.020]   Can I cancel the other one first?
[01:57:02.020 --> 01:57:04.960]   The most has a TV has Alexa in it.
[01:57:04.960 --> 01:57:05.960]   It has the YouTube TV.
[01:57:05.960 --> 01:57:06.960]   Oh, cool.
[01:57:06.960 --> 01:57:09.060]   Who's got a two talks to their TV.
[01:57:09.060 --> 01:57:10.440]   What do you say?
[01:57:10.440 --> 01:57:14.220]   Hey, hey, echo change the turn the volume up.
[01:57:14.220 --> 01:57:20.100]   I tell it, I walk through my living room and I say, hey, computer, raise the curtains.
[01:57:20.100 --> 01:57:21.100]   50%.
[01:57:21.100 --> 01:57:22.100]   Lock the doors.
[01:57:22.100 --> 01:57:25.940]   Turn the lights on dim so we could get in that movie theater mode and make sure I
[01:57:25.940 --> 01:57:29.980]   put my popcorn is ready because I got at Amazon microwave.
[01:57:29.980 --> 01:57:30.980]   Okay.
[01:57:30.980 --> 01:57:31.980]   It's all automated, baby.
[01:57:31.980 --> 01:57:32.980]   Come on, man.
[01:57:32.980 --> 01:57:33.980]   Okay.
[01:57:33.980 --> 01:57:35.220]   Where are we living in the future?
[01:57:35.220 --> 01:57:36.220]   Okay.
[01:57:36.220 --> 01:57:37.980]   I'm canceling it right now, wait a minute.
[01:57:37.980 --> 01:57:38.980]   Let's write you.
[01:57:38.980 --> 01:57:39.980]   See.
[01:57:39.980 --> 01:57:40.980]   Michael's got a sign.
[01:57:40.980 --> 01:57:41.980]   I'll make him a thank you.
[01:57:41.980 --> 01:57:45.180]   And I thank you for your daughter's soap, by the way.
[01:57:45.180 --> 01:57:46.180]   Thank you.
[01:57:46.180 --> 01:57:47.980]   Because your daughter's soap is fantastic.
[01:57:47.980 --> 01:57:50.580]   At least I know you're clean.
[01:57:50.580 --> 01:57:52.540]   If you're not using your mind, I know you're clean.
[01:57:52.540 --> 01:57:53.540]   I know that.
[01:57:53.540 --> 01:57:55.900]   Where can people buy you a daughter's soap?
[01:57:55.900 --> 01:57:56.900]   It's Leah.com.
[01:57:56.900 --> 01:57:57.900]   We're not going to talk about today though.
[01:57:57.900 --> 01:58:00.420]   Because I got yelled at last talk because we wanted to soap show, but this isn't even
[01:58:00.420 --> 01:58:01.420]   a tech show today.
[01:58:01.420 --> 01:58:02.420]   I don't know what we're doing, Uncle Leo.
[01:58:02.420 --> 01:58:03.420]   I don't know either.
[01:58:03.420 --> 01:58:05.460]   We talked about the electric car.
[01:58:05.460 --> 01:58:06.460]   We talked about everything.
[01:58:06.460 --> 01:58:11.180]   See, Rob, you would be infuriated doing a show with somebody like Leo.
[01:58:11.180 --> 01:58:13.700]   You know, they want to buy a car, all the bells and whistles, but they don't want to
[01:58:13.700 --> 01:58:14.700]   test any of it out.
[01:58:14.700 --> 01:58:15.700]   You know what I mean?
[01:58:15.700 --> 01:58:18.700]   It's like buying a Lamborghini and pushing it down the street.
[01:58:18.700 --> 01:58:19.700]   Wait, what are we doing?
[01:58:19.700 --> 01:58:20.700]   Like, what?
[01:58:20.700 --> 01:58:21.700]   Yeah, no, it's true.
[01:58:21.700 --> 01:58:22.700]   I drive it about five miles an hour.
[01:58:22.700 --> 01:58:23.700]   It's really true.
[01:58:23.700 --> 01:58:24.700]   Oh.
[01:58:24.700 --> 01:58:28.940]   I just, I drive the speed limit, which probably hurts somebody like you, Robert.
[01:58:28.940 --> 01:58:33.940]   No, I mean, it's important to drive the speed limit as a human, I guess.
[01:58:33.940 --> 01:58:34.940]   You know, it's safe.
[01:58:34.940 --> 01:58:40.460]   At least you're not driving, at least you're not driving below the speed limit or at 120
[01:58:40.460 --> 01:58:45.300]   miles an hour, which is, every time I see someone driving like quickly on the road.
[01:58:45.300 --> 01:58:49.380]   But I do have to admit, I wonder who's buying these Lamborghinis and Ferraris and driving
[01:58:49.380 --> 01:58:51.860]   them, you know, in a 25 mile an hour school zone.
[01:58:51.860 --> 01:58:54.260]   It seems like that seems like a waste.
[01:58:54.260 --> 01:58:57.060]   They, it's, you know, people are buying those to show off.
[01:58:57.060 --> 01:58:58.820]   They, they drive around LA.
[01:58:58.820 --> 01:58:59.820]   They go to a club.
[01:58:59.820 --> 01:59:01.460]   They keep them in a tax haven at the airport.
[01:59:01.460 --> 01:59:02.460]   I know.
[01:59:02.460 --> 01:59:03.460]   Yeah.
[01:59:03.460 --> 01:59:04.460]   They rev the engine.
[01:59:04.460 --> 01:59:06.580]   They're not taking them to the track.
[01:59:06.580 --> 01:59:10.700]   You should be taking these cars of the track or to the middle of the desert in Nevada where
[01:59:10.700 --> 01:59:12.100]   there's no one else around.
[01:59:12.100 --> 01:59:16.020]   You should not be driving them at 120 miles an hour on the 405 because you're going to
[01:59:16.020 --> 01:59:18.940]   kill somebody and you might kill yourself.
[01:59:18.940 --> 01:59:22.420]   They go out once a month and they're little car show buddies and rev it up at the local
[01:59:22.420 --> 01:59:23.420]   mall, you know?
[01:59:23.420 --> 01:59:26.580]   Bum, are they do burnouts and then just land in a ditch?
[01:59:26.580 --> 01:59:29.780]   So many people don't know how to drive a car.
[01:59:29.780 --> 01:59:33.100]   That's a whole don't even get me started on the, on the whole issue that any idiot can
[01:59:33.100 --> 01:59:38.780]   buy a car with 500 horsepower because any idiot can end up in a ditch in about five minutes.
[01:59:38.780 --> 01:59:39.780]   And, and let me tell you something.
[01:59:39.780 --> 01:59:44.460]   First time you get in the car, I drove my buddy's Hellcat and he was like, Oh, you know,
[01:59:44.460 --> 01:59:46.060]   be easy as got a little pep.
[01:59:46.060 --> 01:59:50.540]   Now I've driven mustangs and muscle cars and stuff, but they're usually like old cars
[01:59:50.540 --> 01:59:51.540]   that are hooked up.
[01:59:51.540 --> 01:59:56.220]   I got that thing and I almost died instantly because I didn't realize it like touching
[01:59:56.220 --> 01:59:57.220]   this pedal.
[01:59:57.220 --> 02:00:00.220]   I was already at 120 miles an hour.
[02:00:00.220 --> 02:00:03.580]   I was on the street away.
[02:00:03.580 --> 02:00:07.940]   I every car I get into regardless of whether it's, you know, a Hyundai Sonata.
[02:00:07.940 --> 02:00:11.940]   We should explain because of your role at car driver, you have a new car to drive almost
[02:00:11.940 --> 02:00:13.100]   every week.
[02:00:13.100 --> 02:00:14.100]   Yeah.
[02:00:14.100 --> 02:00:15.100]   Yeah.
[02:00:15.100 --> 02:00:18.860]   So I typically have some something every week and it's, you know, like I said, it could
[02:00:18.860 --> 02:00:19.860]   be a Hyundai Sonata.
[02:00:19.860 --> 02:00:20.860]   Good car.
[02:00:20.860 --> 02:00:23.980]   It could be, you know, the Ferrari super fast.
[02:00:23.980 --> 02:00:24.980]   You don't get to choose.
[02:00:24.980 --> 02:00:26.460]   It's just like what's the car of the week.
[02:00:26.460 --> 02:00:27.460]   No, no, I choose.
[02:00:27.460 --> 02:00:30.980]   It's typically I pick, especially now as the sort of freelance.
[02:00:30.980 --> 02:00:32.780]   So I pick and choose what I want.
[02:00:32.780 --> 02:00:33.780]   Right.
[02:00:33.780 --> 02:00:35.380]   And then they decide whether or not I deserve it.
[02:00:35.380 --> 02:00:36.380]   Right.
[02:00:36.380 --> 02:00:39.820]   No, but if you have a, you know, our friend, Sam, our friend, Samable Sam who is also a
[02:00:39.820 --> 02:00:41.780]   car guy does that too.
[02:00:41.780 --> 02:00:47.060]   If you have a good reputation and you, you know, you write for important journals, they're
[02:00:47.060 --> 02:00:48.740]   very good about loners.
[02:00:48.740 --> 02:00:49.740]   You know, it helps.
[02:00:49.740 --> 02:00:53.340]   He's in Michigan, but I guess they have stuff out in Northern California too.
[02:00:53.340 --> 02:00:54.340]   Yeah.
[02:00:54.340 --> 02:00:55.580]   There's, there's, there's fleet services here.
[02:00:55.580 --> 02:00:59.940]   There's in New York, L.A., Michigan, I think Miami as well.
[02:00:59.940 --> 02:01:05.060]   But the, the point is any car I get into the first time I drive it, I do not get into
[02:01:05.060 --> 02:01:07.060]   a Lamborghini and slam on the grass.
[02:01:07.060 --> 02:01:08.060]   I get very slow.
[02:01:08.060 --> 02:01:09.060]   Careful.
[02:01:09.060 --> 02:01:10.060]   I make sure I'm the mirror.
[02:01:10.060 --> 02:01:12.020]   I get the feel of the car.
[02:01:12.020 --> 02:01:13.020]   Yeah.
[02:01:13.020 --> 02:01:14.020]   So I don't know.
[02:01:14.020 --> 02:01:15.020]   I do that too.
[02:01:15.020 --> 02:01:16.420]   With, when I get in a rental car.
[02:01:16.420 --> 02:01:17.420]   I don't really.
[02:01:17.420 --> 02:01:18.420]   Yeah.
[02:01:18.420 --> 02:01:24.060]   And the only time you get into, yeah, regardless of how powerful it is or not, yeah, get the
[02:01:24.060 --> 02:01:28.380]   feel of the car before you decide, like I'm just going to stop on the horse and if you're
[02:01:28.380 --> 02:01:30.380]   on, see if you can do a wheelie.
[02:01:30.380 --> 02:01:34.340]   And I've driven other fast cars before.
[02:01:34.340 --> 02:01:37.420]   It's just that that car had so much muscle to it.
[02:01:37.420 --> 02:01:40.740]   It just felt different than, like I've been, I guess I've been a muscle cause I've been
[02:01:40.740 --> 02:01:41.740]   in courses.
[02:01:41.740 --> 02:01:44.940]   I've been in Ferrari, like I've driven 200 miles an hour.
[02:01:44.940 --> 02:01:48.420]   And usually, like you said, you have to work up to that speed.
[02:01:48.420 --> 02:01:52.180]   I don't know what some of those hell cats that car just just screams at you like you
[02:01:52.180 --> 02:01:53.180]   just tap the accelerator.
[02:01:53.180 --> 02:01:57.980]   The hell cat is essentially a rock with a rocket engine shoved on the back.
[02:01:57.980 --> 02:02:03.700]   It is a big heavy just, it's great for going straight and getting the hell out of your
[02:02:03.700 --> 02:02:04.700]   passengers.
[02:02:04.700 --> 02:02:10.180]   And the reason for that ever tell you about driving fast in cars is the whole stopping thing.
[02:02:10.180 --> 02:02:11.180]   Right.
[02:02:11.180 --> 02:02:14.900]   So I was on a track and a guy was like, yeah, like if you get over one foot, you're like,
[02:02:14.900 --> 02:02:17.180]   50, you know, there's deers and stuff out here.
[02:02:17.180 --> 02:02:20.220]   He's like, don't jam the brakes because you're not going to be able to stop.
[02:02:20.220 --> 02:02:21.220]   You just got to keep going.
[02:02:21.220 --> 02:02:23.540]   I'm like, that doesn't drive through the deer.
[02:02:23.540 --> 02:02:24.540]   Is that your advice?
[02:02:24.540 --> 02:02:25.540]   Yeah.
[02:02:25.540 --> 02:02:26.540]   Okay.
[02:02:26.540 --> 02:02:27.540]   Try.
[02:02:27.540 --> 02:02:28.540]   No, not my advice at all.
[02:02:28.540 --> 02:02:29.540]   Okay.
[02:02:29.540 --> 02:02:30.540]   I want to take a break.
[02:02:30.540 --> 02:02:32.540]   We're going to come back.
[02:02:32.540 --> 02:02:33.780]   We're going to come back.
[02:02:33.780 --> 02:02:35.740]   I have a couple more stories.
[02:02:35.740 --> 02:02:42.020]   I want to ask you guys, if you saw the, the new Justice League, the, the Zack Snyder, the
[02:02:42.020 --> 02:02:45.660]   rest of your life edition where it's, you'd like, you're still watching the movie three
[02:02:45.660 --> 02:02:46.660]   years later.
[02:02:46.660 --> 02:02:48.220]   We're going to talk about that lots more.
[02:02:48.220 --> 02:02:49.620]   We got a great panel.
[02:02:49.620 --> 02:02:51.100]   Georgia Dow is here.
[02:02:51.100 --> 02:02:52.980]   Anxiety video is still there, right?
[02:02:52.980 --> 02:02:54.980]   Anxiety-vids.com.
[02:02:54.980 --> 02:03:00.940]   If you want help with parenting with sleeping with anxiety, it's a great source of information.
[02:03:00.940 --> 02:03:02.860]   Anxiety-vids.com.
[02:03:02.860 --> 02:03:08.660]   Her email, which she still gives out to anybody suffering during this difficult time.
[02:03:08.660 --> 02:03:14.380]   And I mean the show is Georgia@WestMountTherapy.com.
[02:03:14.380 --> 02:03:16.300]   Georgia@WestMountTherapy.com.
[02:03:16.300 --> 02:03:19.100]   And you live in a beautiful pink void.
[02:03:19.100 --> 02:03:20.100]   It's so perfect.
[02:03:20.100 --> 02:03:21.100]   I know.
[02:03:21.100 --> 02:03:22.100]   It's very, it's very pink.
[02:03:22.100 --> 02:03:23.100]   It's so beautiful.
[02:03:23.100 --> 02:03:24.100]   It's so lovely.
[02:03:24.100 --> 02:03:25.100]   But, yeah.
[02:03:25.100 --> 02:03:32.420]   Meanwhile, O&J J stone who's living in a photographer's paradise with his cannon R50
[02:03:32.420 --> 02:03:33.660]   and all that.
[02:03:33.660 --> 02:03:34.900]   Do black box office.
[02:03:34.900 --> 02:03:36.700]   That's what my Wi-Fi is.
[02:03:36.700 --> 02:03:37.700]   Did you?
[02:03:37.700 --> 02:03:39.940]   Yeah, like a month ago.
[02:03:39.940 --> 02:03:41.540]   So I'm painting.
[02:03:41.540 --> 02:03:43.020]   This room is all black and-
[02:03:43.020 --> 02:03:44.020]   Nice.
[02:03:44.020 --> 02:03:45.020]   I mean, but I love it.
[02:03:45.020 --> 02:03:48.540]   And you got special LED lights so you can do strange effects.
[02:03:48.540 --> 02:03:50.740]   I'm going back on to YouTube, Uncle Leo.
[02:03:50.740 --> 02:03:52.660]   I got to get to LEDs and a bokeh.
[02:03:52.660 --> 02:03:56.260]   See, people are saying I look kind of soft just because I got this little lens thing.
[02:03:56.260 --> 02:03:58.980]   You're doing a Vaseline thing.
[02:03:58.980 --> 02:04:02.700]   I got to say though, I can just- just maybe it's just me.
[02:04:02.700 --> 02:04:05.620]   But the logo over your right shoulder.
[02:04:05.620 --> 02:04:11.900]   I do not think it looks like what you think it looks like or you think it is.
[02:04:11.900 --> 02:04:16.860]   I would reconsider that it's not immediately obvious.
[02:04:16.860 --> 02:04:17.860]   Do you know what that is?
[02:04:17.860 --> 02:04:20.140]   The girl on the right, the woman I recognize.
[02:04:20.140 --> 02:04:21.140]   I don't know what the-
[02:04:21.140 --> 02:04:24.500]   You don't know what the logo is?
[02:04:24.500 --> 02:04:25.500]   No.
[02:04:25.500 --> 02:04:26.500]   It's blurry.
[02:04:26.500 --> 02:04:27.500]   It's blurry.
[02:04:27.500 --> 02:04:28.500]   It's on.
[02:04:28.500 --> 02:04:29.500]   This one is thundercats.
[02:04:29.500 --> 02:04:30.500]   I know what it looks like.
[02:04:30.500 --> 02:04:31.500]   That one's super weird.
[02:04:31.500 --> 02:04:32.500]   Oh.
[02:04:32.500 --> 02:04:33.500]   I'm at a 1.4.
[02:04:33.500 --> 02:04:35.500]   So if we were at a 2.8 you get-
[02:04:35.500 --> 02:04:37.100]   Superman with long hair?
[02:04:37.100 --> 02:04:38.100]   Okay.
[02:04:38.100 --> 02:04:39.700]   Well, she's not Superman at all.
[02:04:39.700 --> 02:04:40.700]   She'd be super gross.
[02:04:40.700 --> 02:04:41.700]   That was the case.
[02:04:41.700 --> 02:04:43.180]   Like do you even know what that little thing is?
[02:04:43.180 --> 02:04:44.180]   No, it's all right.
[02:04:44.180 --> 02:04:45.180]   We're done.
[02:04:45.180 --> 02:04:46.180]   I'm moving on.
[02:04:46.180 --> 02:04:47.180]   What is that?
[02:04:47.180 --> 02:04:48.180]   A robot?
[02:04:48.180 --> 02:04:49.180]   What is that?
[02:04:49.180 --> 02:04:50.180]   I don't know what he's got.
[02:04:50.180 --> 02:04:51.180]   Why was he-
[02:04:51.180 --> 02:04:52.180]   You know what?
[02:04:52.180 --> 02:04:53.180]   This is the problem with bokeh.
[02:04:53.180 --> 02:04:54.180]   Bokeh.
[02:04:54.180 --> 02:04:57.100]   It's so far back that all it is is a blur to me.
[02:04:57.100 --> 02:04:58.100]   That's right.
[02:04:58.100 --> 02:04:59.100]   That's all it is.
[02:04:59.100 --> 02:05:00.100]   That's Wanda.
[02:05:00.100 --> 02:05:04.780]   That's what my life looks like when I'm not wearing my glasses.
[02:05:04.780 --> 02:05:06.900]   Our show today brought to you by Extra-
[02:05:06.900 --> 02:05:08.620]   Oh, I forgot Roberto Baldwin.
[02:05:08.620 --> 02:05:09.620]   I almost-
[02:05:09.620 --> 02:05:10.620]   I'm plugging everybody.
[02:05:10.620 --> 02:05:13.020]   Automotive tech journalist.
[02:05:13.020 --> 02:05:15.300]   His Twitter is strange ways.
[02:05:15.300 --> 02:05:18.220]   S-T-R-N-G-W-Y-S.
[02:05:18.220 --> 02:05:19.900]   No vowels.
[02:05:19.900 --> 02:05:23.700]   And we mention it, but I'll mention it again because I know there are lots of people who
[02:05:23.700 --> 02:05:28.460]   want to sign up for your next big show.
[02:05:28.460 --> 02:05:32.660]   The address is scum.
[02:05:32.660 --> 02:05:33.660]   The band.
[02:05:33.660 --> 02:05:34.660]   What is it?
[02:05:34.660 --> 02:05:38.020]   And just go to nazum.com.
[02:05:38.020 --> 02:05:41.860]   N-A-S-C-U-M.com.
[02:05:41.860 --> 02:05:43.860]   N-A-SCUM.com.
[02:05:43.860 --> 02:05:47.300]   And it will take you to where you want to be.
[02:05:47.300 --> 02:05:49.540]   Anything else we can plug for you?
[02:05:49.540 --> 02:05:51.380]   I don't know.
[02:05:51.380 --> 02:05:53.540]   You don't have a YouTube channel yet.
[02:05:53.540 --> 02:05:54.540]   You're such a-
[02:05:54.540 --> 02:05:57.820]   You know I have a horrible podcast that I've been doing.
[02:05:57.820 --> 02:05:58.820]   Okay.
[02:05:58.820 --> 02:06:02.860]   I started to back up again and that's just YouTube at S-T-R-N-G-W-Y-S.
[02:06:02.860 --> 02:06:03.860]   Okay.
[02:06:03.860 --> 02:06:06.180]   There's some car videos on there.
[02:06:06.180 --> 02:06:07.180]   Oh good.
[02:06:07.180 --> 02:06:09.180]   It's time to start my bad podcast.
[02:06:09.180 --> 02:06:10.180]   Time to start plugging that stuff.
[02:06:10.180 --> 02:06:11.180]   Yeah.
[02:06:11.180 --> 02:06:12.180]   Yeah.
[02:06:12.180 --> 02:06:13.180]   I think I'll-
[02:06:13.180 --> 02:06:14.740]   I'll probably do on Twitter so I can find out all the fun stuff you're doing.
[02:06:14.740 --> 02:06:15.740]   You just got to start tweeting it out.
[02:06:15.740 --> 02:06:16.740]   Yeah, there you go.
[02:06:16.740 --> 02:06:19.140]   I'll follow them on the Twitter.
[02:06:19.140 --> 02:06:20.940]   Our show today brought to you by ExtraHop.
[02:06:20.940 --> 02:06:25.300]   Boy, oh boy, that SolarWinds attack, the Sunburst attack.
[02:06:25.300 --> 02:06:26.780]   Quite a wake up call.
[02:06:26.780 --> 02:06:28.980]   I think for a lot of sysadmins out there.
[02:06:28.980 --> 02:06:31.380]   And then there's the exchange server.
[02:06:31.380 --> 02:06:33.260]   I mean, it's just been a nightmare.
[02:06:33.260 --> 02:06:36.900]   Cyber attacks are becoming more advanced, harder to detect.
[02:06:36.900 --> 02:06:43.460]   And the real problem, especially with this exchange server flaw, these zero days is you
[02:06:43.460 --> 02:06:47.780]   can- you can remediate the exploit, but do you know if the hackers are already in your
[02:06:47.780 --> 02:06:51.020]   network or are they already reading all your email?
[02:06:51.020 --> 02:06:55.700]   The most advanced threat actors, most dangerous ones are the ones in the environment.
[02:06:55.700 --> 02:06:57.380]   They've been there for a long time without our knowledge.
[02:06:57.380 --> 02:07:00.740]   The APTs, the advanced persistent threats.
[02:07:00.740 --> 02:07:04.580]   And cyber criminals get past your defenses.
[02:07:04.580 --> 02:07:06.220]   Businesses need a plan for detection.
[02:07:06.220 --> 02:07:07.700]   They need a plan for response.
[02:07:07.700 --> 02:07:11.700]   The old model is just not enough.
[02:07:11.700 --> 02:07:14.660]   The old protection and prevention alone is not enough.
[02:07:14.660 --> 02:07:15.660]   They're in there.
[02:07:15.660 --> 02:07:16.820]   Well, they might be.
[02:07:16.820 --> 02:07:18.580]   That's why you need ExtraHop Reveal Access.
[02:07:18.580 --> 02:07:22.220]   The only solution that shows you not just where intruders are going, but where they've
[02:07:22.220 --> 02:07:24.260]   been, where they've been.
[02:07:24.260 --> 02:07:29.260]   So you can investigate incidents and prevent them from turning into full-blown breaches.
[02:07:29.260 --> 02:07:30.260]   And cyber techs make the news.
[02:07:30.260 --> 02:07:34.540]   The first question everybody asks, I know it's what I ask our IT department is, have
[02:07:34.540 --> 02:07:35.540]   we been compromised?
[02:07:35.540 --> 02:07:38.460]   But how do you know?
[02:07:38.460 --> 02:07:41.460]   ExtraHop Reveal Access makes it super simple to answer that question.
[02:07:41.460 --> 02:07:46.180]   You get 90 days of record look back, complete network visibility across the data center,
[02:07:46.180 --> 02:07:48.460]   cloud even out to the device edge.
[02:07:48.460 --> 02:07:51.300]   So security teams can get the real answers they need in seconds.
[02:07:51.300 --> 02:07:56.140]   And in a post-compromised world, your greatest chance at stopping advanced threats is with
[02:07:56.140 --> 02:07:59.900]   ExtraHop's network detection and response, their NDR.
[02:07:59.900 --> 02:08:05.540]   You know the faster you respond, the faster you mitigate, the less damage is done.
[02:08:05.540 --> 02:08:09.580]   Learn more about how ExtraHop stops reach is 84% faster.
[02:08:09.580 --> 02:08:10.980]   And they've got a great interactive demo.
[02:08:10.980 --> 02:08:12.740]   I think you're going to enjoy it.
[02:08:12.740 --> 02:08:13.740]   It's great.
[02:08:13.740 --> 02:08:14.740]   I can.

[02:10:00.340 --> 02:10:06.340]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[02:10:06.340 --> 02:10:13.340]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[02:10:13.340 --> 02:10:20.340]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[02:10:20.340 --> 02:10:27.340]   I'm going to go to the next one.

[02:10:33.340 --> 02:10:40.340]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[02:10:40.340 --> 02:10:47.340]   I'm going to go to the next one.

[02:12:06.340 --> 02:12:15.340]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[02:12:15.340 --> 02:12:21.340]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[02:12:21.340 --> 02:12:26.340]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[02:12:26.340 --> 02:12:32.340]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[02:12:32.340 --> 02:12:37.340]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[02:12:37.340 --> 02:12:44.340]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[02:12:44.340 --> 02:12:50.340]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[02:12:50.340 --> 02:12:55.340]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[02:12:55.340 --> 02:13:03.340]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[02:13:03.340 --> 02:13:13.340]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[02:13:13.340 --> 02:13:23.340]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[02:13:23.340 --> 02:13:28.340]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[02:13:28.340 --> 02:13:33.340]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[02:13:33.340 --> 02:13:42.340]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[02:13:42.340 --> 02:13:48.340]   I'm going to go to the next one.
[02:13:48.340 --> 02:13:53.340]   They could have ignored him or yelled at him.
[02:13:53.340 --> 02:14:01.340]   They have actually paid him $10,000 for a bug bounty.
[02:14:01.340 --> 02:14:05.340]   They're going to fix it.
[02:14:05.340 --> 02:14:11.340]   After seven years, the official patches live as of March 16.
[02:14:11.340 --> 02:14:17.340]   I remember I was reading an article last month about a CEO laid off a thousand people and
[02:14:17.340 --> 02:14:21.340]   he gave everybody a $250 gift card.
[02:14:21.340 --> 02:14:23.340]   $200 million bonus.
[02:14:23.340 --> 02:14:28.340]   He literally could have gave every single person a $10 million and still got $10 million
[02:14:28.340 --> 02:14:29.340]   for himself.
[02:14:29.340 --> 02:14:31.340]   That's $10 million a lot.
[02:14:31.340 --> 02:14:33.340]   You're going to give him $100,000.
[02:14:33.340 --> 02:14:36.340]   He still made your $100 million bonus.
[02:14:36.340 --> 02:14:40.340]   The fact that they gave his guy $10,000 is great because companies usually just give you
[02:14:40.340 --> 02:14:45.340]   a giveaway and a gift card for some free loot on the game and say, "Go on about your day."
[02:14:45.340 --> 02:14:46.340]   Think about it.
[02:14:46.340 --> 02:14:51.340]   One of the reasons he got a $100 million bonus is because he's a cheapskate and saved the
[02:14:51.340 --> 02:14:56.340]   company a lot of money by giving out $250 gift cards.
[02:14:56.340 --> 02:15:00.340]   That's what they reward you for.
[02:15:00.340 --> 02:15:04.340]   Let's see.
[02:15:04.340 --> 02:15:10.340]   Is there anything else that I have missed that you guys wanted to talk about?
[02:15:10.340 --> 02:15:15.340]   I thought we talked about a lot of fun things.
[02:15:15.340 --> 02:15:19.340]   Roberto, is there any car news that you think we should be thinking about?
[02:15:19.340 --> 02:15:21.340]   Oh, gosh.
[02:15:21.340 --> 02:15:26.340]   You reported on the car driver, the story that we talked about, I think on Wednesday, that
[02:15:26.340 --> 02:15:34.340]   the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is getting chewed out by the NTSB, which,
[02:15:34.340 --> 02:15:40.340]   they're both federal agencies, but the NTSB, which investigates crashes, is telling the
[02:15:40.340 --> 02:15:47.340]   NHTAC TSA, which regulates self-driving, you guys should do a better job regulating self-driving.
[02:15:47.340 --> 02:15:55.340]   No, this is a long time, sort of, I guess, clash within these government agencies.
[02:15:55.340 --> 02:16:05.340]   I went to an NTSB hearing back in January 2020, and they spent half the hearing sort of chewing
[02:16:05.340 --> 02:16:07.340]   out NHTAC TSA.
[02:16:07.340 --> 02:16:09.340]   That's a lot easier to say.
[02:16:09.340 --> 02:16:11.340]   NHTAC, that's what I'll say.
[02:16:11.340 --> 02:16:17.340]   Most of the time chewing on NHTAC, because they're saying it's not NHTAC's job to sell cars.
[02:16:17.340 --> 02:16:24.340]   And it feels like NHTAC is, as I say, they don't want to stymie the development of autonomous
[02:16:24.340 --> 02:16:28.340]   and driver assistance features.
[02:16:28.340 --> 02:16:30.340]   But there's no baseline.
[02:16:30.340 --> 02:16:34.340]   There's nothing to say whether or not this works well, this doesn't work well.
[02:16:34.340 --> 02:16:42.340]   And without that, your average consumer doesn't know the difference between how well maybe Mercedes-Benz adaptive
[02:16:42.340 --> 02:16:47.340]   cruise control works versus how well maybe Hyundai's adaptive cruise control system works.
[02:16:47.340 --> 02:16:51.340]   There are two, they might be wildly different.
[02:16:51.340 --> 02:16:54.340]   Apparently mine is no better than a 1995 Honda's.
[02:16:54.340 --> 02:16:57.340]   So I wish I'd known that.
[02:16:57.340 --> 02:16:58.340]   Oh, when?
[02:16:58.340 --> 02:17:01.340]   Yeah, there's NHTAC.
[02:17:01.340 --> 02:17:07.780]   NHTAC could create a system that judges these, that ranks them, that gives consumers the
[02:17:07.780 --> 02:17:10.780]   option to see how well those systems work.
[02:17:10.780 --> 02:17:16.060]   If that's a very important feature for you, you should know how well works compared to
[02:17:16.060 --> 02:17:19.340]   the rest of the market.
[02:17:19.340 --> 02:17:24.100]   But also they've sort of just allowed autonomous vehicles to just be tested on the road with
[02:17:24.100 --> 02:17:25.100]   other drivers.
[02:17:25.100 --> 02:17:30.580]   It's like the guy doing 150 miles an hour in his Lamborghini, except now you see videos
[02:17:30.580 --> 02:17:37.620]   of people just driving around with their Teslas, going over lines, not stopping at stoplights.
[02:17:37.620 --> 02:17:43.660]   It's sort of insane that it's NHTAC's job to regulate this and they've decided to have
[02:17:43.660 --> 02:17:45.140]   a very hands-off approach.
[02:17:45.140 --> 02:17:47.540]   The NTSB is not happy about it.
[02:17:47.540 --> 02:17:50.620]   Yeah, I think that's right actually.
[02:17:50.620 --> 02:17:56.460]   Is there any indication from NHTAC that maybe they will start to do that?
[02:17:56.460 --> 02:18:00.180]   Maybe I think it's a new administration, but it's not like this was something that was
[02:18:00.180 --> 02:18:01.460]   part of the Trump administration.
[02:18:01.460 --> 02:18:03.620]   This is, you know, a bomb I'd admit.
[02:18:03.620 --> 02:18:07.980]   Yeah, forever, NHTAC has sort of been sort of hands-off with, because I think they were
[02:18:07.980 --> 02:18:12.060]   sort of sold on the tech world's promise of a better world.
[02:18:12.060 --> 02:18:15.500]   We're making the world better, we're changing the world.
[02:18:15.500 --> 02:18:20.260]   And then the unintended consequences of that is all the insanity we see on Twitter, all
[02:18:20.260 --> 02:18:22.420]   the insanity we see on Facebook.
[02:18:22.420 --> 02:18:28.900]   So the unintended consequences of allowing these automakers and Teslas is sort of the
[02:18:28.900 --> 02:18:34.020]   prime example to just beta test autonomous features on the road.
[02:18:34.020 --> 02:18:36.580]   And they tell people, you know, you have to keep your hands on the wheel and you have
[02:18:36.580 --> 02:18:37.580]   to keep your eyes on the road.
[02:18:37.580 --> 02:18:40.980]   But at the same time, you call it autopilot, you call it full self-driving.
[02:18:40.980 --> 02:18:47.460]   Like, what is, you know, there's marketing and then there's reality and most people are
[02:18:47.460 --> 02:18:50.420]   listening to marketing.
[02:18:50.420 --> 02:18:54.500]   Fascinating story in the Apple world.
[02:18:54.500 --> 02:18:56.700]   You might note that we have been hearing rumors.
[02:18:56.700 --> 02:19:01.540]   Apple would have an event this Tuesday, but no invitations have gone out.
[02:19:01.540 --> 02:19:02.620]   No word has gone out.
[02:19:02.620 --> 02:19:07.340]   A number of leakers said, oh, yeah, March 23rd, including John Prosser.
[02:19:07.340 --> 02:19:14.300]   Now John is saying in his latest video, Apple punked him and others, they used a control
[02:19:14.300 --> 02:19:24.940]   leak putting out that March 23rd date to the sources in Apple to capture, to catch them,
[02:19:24.940 --> 02:19:27.740]   to out the leakers.
[02:19:27.740 --> 02:19:29.420]   Georgia never ever.
[02:19:29.420 --> 02:19:31.260]   Yeah, they're famous for that.
[02:19:31.260 --> 02:19:38.060]   We're talking about that when Steve Jobs was at Apple, he intentionally made up a fake project
[02:19:38.060 --> 02:19:40.580]   told a number of groups just to see who would leak it.
[02:19:40.580 --> 02:19:43.940]   Looks like they're doing it again.
[02:19:43.940 --> 02:19:47.700]   So a number of leakers who said there would be an event March 23rd this Tuesday.
[02:19:47.700 --> 02:19:49.940]   We were all prepared to do it.
[02:19:49.940 --> 02:19:52.660]   I guess there's not going to be an event.
[02:19:52.660 --> 02:19:53.660]   And it was all an event.
[02:19:53.660 --> 02:19:57.380]   So that's how they did an event in the first quarter of the year.
[02:19:57.380 --> 02:19:59.780]   Oh, I think they'd usually do in the spring.
[02:19:59.780 --> 02:20:01.580]   It's like an iPad event.
[02:20:01.580 --> 02:20:02.580]   Yeah.
[02:20:02.580 --> 02:20:03.580]   Yeah, you're right.
[02:20:03.580 --> 02:20:05.020]   I guess the stuff that I don't care about.
[02:20:05.020 --> 02:20:06.020]   Yeah.
[02:20:06.020 --> 02:20:07.860]   In fact, it would be stuff you don't care about.
[02:20:07.860 --> 02:20:13.820]   It'd be Apple's air tags, which have been rumored for a year and still hoping.
[02:20:13.820 --> 02:20:15.620]   I'm still hoping.
[02:20:15.620 --> 02:20:17.620]   Still want it.
[02:20:17.620 --> 02:20:23.620]   A new iPad Pro, which we're kind of due for with this new mini LED screen we all want
[02:20:23.620 --> 02:20:29.260]   to see because Apple's going to go mini LED across this whole product line, we think.
[02:20:29.260 --> 02:20:31.740]   And perhaps a new Apple TV.
[02:20:31.740 --> 02:20:32.900]   But you're right.
[02:20:32.900 --> 02:20:33.980]   Maybe it won't be in March.
[02:20:33.980 --> 02:20:36.260]   Maybe it'll be in April and maybe who cares?
[02:20:36.260 --> 02:20:41.380]   Inside note because the cover of the chat ads from the beginning of the show, this thing
[02:20:41.380 --> 02:20:43.140]   is a little hard drive.
[02:20:43.140 --> 02:20:44.140]   Yeah.
[02:20:44.140 --> 02:20:45.140]   Yeah.
[02:20:45.140 --> 02:20:47.140]   USB ports and all that kind of stuff.
[02:20:47.140 --> 02:20:48.140]   I had two terrible.
[02:20:48.140 --> 02:20:50.980]   I could cheap out and not spend all the money on hard drive from this thing.
[02:20:50.980 --> 02:20:52.460]   No, I've used those on Mac mini's before.
[02:20:52.460 --> 02:20:55.180]   I think it's a great, great little product.
[02:20:55.180 --> 02:20:58.460]   I love that John though, because he was wrong.
[02:20:58.460 --> 02:21:01.580]   He's going to have to shave off his eyebrows and he's going to go through with that.
[02:21:01.580 --> 02:21:03.020]   He's going to do it.
[02:21:03.020 --> 02:21:04.300]   I think he's going to do it.
[02:21:04.300 --> 02:21:05.620]   I don't think that he has a choice.
[02:21:05.620 --> 02:21:06.620]   But I, you know what?
[02:21:06.620 --> 02:21:08.100]   Like live by the store, die by the store.
[02:21:08.100 --> 02:21:12.500]   And I think that that's like he said he was going to do it good for him for doing it.
[02:21:12.500 --> 02:21:21.820]   So two things then never go to a second location and do not promise to shave your eyebrows.
[02:21:21.820 --> 02:21:22.820]   This is the tweet.
[02:21:22.820 --> 02:21:24.260]   Unless you really listened.
[02:21:24.260 --> 02:21:25.260]   And this is an example.
[02:21:25.260 --> 02:21:26.260]   Aren't you going to watch it?
[02:21:26.260 --> 02:21:27.260]   Wouldn't you watch?
[02:21:27.260 --> 02:21:28.260]   Wouldn't you watch?
[02:21:28.260 --> 02:21:29.260]   Let's just say it.
[02:21:29.260 --> 02:21:34.820]   We have the raccoon being played in the middle of, you know, the band and then we have the
[02:21:34.820 --> 02:21:36.500]   shaving off of the, we want that.
[02:21:36.500 --> 02:21:37.700]   We are so bored.
[02:21:37.700 --> 02:21:38.700]   He's on the record.
[02:21:38.700 --> 02:21:40.100]   He said it on Twitter.
[02:21:40.100 --> 02:21:45.260]   That means it will always be there for every binding is a legally binding contract.
[02:21:45.260 --> 02:21:48.700]   Renee just, just, just message me.
[02:21:48.700 --> 02:21:52.980]   He will be doing it on Tuesday and he will be giving the proceeds to charity.
[02:21:52.980 --> 02:21:54.980]   Oh, like look at that turning something.
[02:21:54.980 --> 02:21:57.900]   Do you know how creepy you look with that eyebrows?
[02:21:57.900 --> 02:22:00.100]   I mean, it's really bad.
[02:22:00.100 --> 02:22:01.100]   It's really bad.
[02:22:01.100 --> 02:22:02.100]   You don't look great.
[02:22:02.100 --> 02:22:03.100]   You don't look.
[02:22:03.100 --> 02:22:07.020]   So first of all, okay, I haven't, I haven't covered Apple in about five years.
[02:22:07.020 --> 02:22:08.020]   They used to work at Mac life.
[02:22:08.020 --> 02:22:09.020]   I ran their website.
[02:22:09.020 --> 02:22:13.580]   I covered Apple for Wyatt, a couple of outfit friend gadget, gizmodo, a bunch of companies.
[02:22:13.580 --> 02:22:15.620]   What the hell's happened in the last five years?
[02:22:15.620 --> 02:22:18.900]   We're like, well, if this doesn't happen, we're shaving eyebrows off.
[02:22:18.900 --> 02:22:21.420]   Yeah, well, you don't need to do that.
[02:22:21.420 --> 02:22:26.940]   It's a, by the way, he's going to donate the perfect, by the way, donate the money he raises
[02:22:26.940 --> 02:22:27.940]   from that episode.
[02:22:27.940 --> 02:22:32.140]   And presumably the hair from his eyebrows to wigs for kids, a charity that gives custom
[02:22:32.140 --> 02:22:35.620]   wigs to children who've lost their hair due to illness treatments are burned.
[02:22:35.620 --> 02:22:37.900]   So it's a good cause.
[02:22:37.900 --> 02:22:39.820]   I don't know if you shave your head off.
[02:22:39.820 --> 02:22:42.980]   I did shave my head off for UNICEF.
[02:22:42.980 --> 02:22:44.620]   And I will never do it again.
[02:22:44.620 --> 02:22:46.980]   Did you lose a bat or had you just did that?
[02:22:46.980 --> 02:22:47.980]   No, no, no.
[02:22:47.980 --> 02:22:49.620]   You thought that that was going to be a good charity.
[02:22:49.620 --> 02:22:50.620]   Yeah.
[02:22:50.620 --> 02:22:55.220]   Do you remember that we used to do a marathon on New Year's Eve?
[02:22:55.220 --> 02:22:57.500]   We would do New Year's around the world.
[02:22:57.500 --> 02:23:02.620]   So we start with the first New Year's and we, which about three a.m. on New Year's Eve.
[02:23:02.620 --> 02:23:08.180]   And then we would do the last one was about three a.m. New Year's Day.
[02:23:08.180 --> 02:23:11.060]   And we'd be there for the whole 24 hours.
[02:23:11.060 --> 02:23:13.940]   The second one we did, we decided to do it for charity.
[02:23:13.940 --> 02:23:17.340]   So we, to raise money for you, I think we raised more than 80 or 90 thousand dollars.
[02:23:17.340 --> 02:23:18.660]   I don't remember the formula.
[02:23:18.660 --> 02:23:24.100]   But I said foolishly, I said if we get, I think I said if we get to 25 thousand, I'll
[02:23:24.100 --> 02:23:26.380]   get a tattoo.
[02:23:26.380 --> 02:23:28.220]   And then I doubled down.
[02:23:28.220 --> 02:23:31.300]   See, this is why I know, Jon Prosser, I didn't even sit on Twitter.
[02:23:31.300 --> 02:23:35.020]   If we get to 55, I think I said, I'll shave my head.
[02:23:35.020 --> 02:23:38.020]   So both happened on.
[02:23:38.020 --> 02:23:39.020]   You got a tattoo?
[02:23:39.020 --> 02:23:40.020]   Yeah.
[02:23:40.020 --> 02:23:41.020]   Yeah.
[02:23:41.020 --> 02:23:42.020]   New Year's Eve.
[02:23:42.020 --> 02:23:43.020]   There's video of it if you really care.
[02:23:43.020 --> 02:23:45.020]   We can't someone cue that up.
[02:23:45.020 --> 02:23:46.020]   I want to see.
[02:23:46.020 --> 02:23:47.020]   No, you don't.
[02:23:47.020 --> 02:23:50.620]   You know, it's a double duck smoking a cigar.
[02:23:50.620 --> 02:23:51.620]   Yeah, exactly.
[02:23:51.620 --> 02:23:52.620]   Yeah.
[02:23:52.620 --> 02:23:53.620]   It's okay.
[02:23:53.620 --> 02:23:54.620]   What do you want?
[02:23:54.620 --> 02:23:57.580]   Never go to a second location.
[02:23:57.580 --> 02:23:59.860]   So but we raised money and it was for UNICEF.
[02:23:59.860 --> 02:24:00.860]   So you know what, Jon?
[02:24:00.860 --> 02:24:01.860]   It's great.
[02:24:01.860 --> 02:24:05.220]   The problem and Lisa will never forgive me for this.
[02:24:05.220 --> 02:24:09.180]   It was a month before Lisa and I got married.
[02:24:09.180 --> 02:24:10.180]   Oh no.
[02:24:10.180 --> 02:24:11.180]   No, no, no.
[02:24:11.180 --> 02:24:15.380]   I am bald and all I'm wearing pictures is horrible.
[02:24:15.380 --> 02:24:17.820]   No, you can't hold her off till afterwards.
[02:24:17.820 --> 02:24:18.820]   It was so horrible.
[02:24:18.820 --> 02:24:20.580]   I wish I had, I just wasn't.
[02:24:20.580 --> 02:24:24.060]   Did you say this on like a whim without asking her?
[02:24:24.060 --> 02:24:25.980]   She came screaming out of her office.
[02:24:25.980 --> 02:24:27.540]   It was about three in the morning.
[02:24:27.540 --> 02:24:29.900]   She came screaming out of her office.
[02:24:29.900 --> 02:24:30.900]   Oh no.
[02:24:30.900 --> 02:24:31.900]   But it was too late.
[02:24:31.900 --> 02:24:32.900]   I said it.
[02:24:32.900 --> 02:24:34.380]   You'd already said it, but you couldn't say that.
[02:24:34.380 --> 02:24:35.380]   We'll do it in a month.
[02:24:35.380 --> 02:24:36.380]   I didn't tweet it.
[02:24:36.380 --> 02:24:38.780]   I should have, you know, I should have used that as a loophole.
[02:24:38.780 --> 02:24:39.780]   Yeah.
[02:24:39.780 --> 02:24:40.780]   It's not a tweet.
[02:24:40.780 --> 02:24:41.780]   So it's not legally by now.
[02:24:41.780 --> 02:24:46.100]   You could have said I'll do it though after my wedding so that so now we have now we have
[02:24:46.100 --> 02:24:47.100]   to see all these wedding pictures.
[02:24:47.100 --> 02:24:48.100]   The worst wedding pictures.
[02:24:48.100 --> 02:24:49.100]   Oh, I love this.
[02:24:49.100 --> 02:24:53.660]   This is like one of those moments where you're like, yeah, be careful.
[02:24:53.660 --> 02:24:54.980]   You see, don't text.
[02:24:54.980 --> 02:24:55.980]   Don't talk.
[02:24:55.980 --> 02:24:56.980]   Don't write.
[02:24:56.980 --> 02:24:58.780]   Make sure you're calm in a good state.
[02:24:58.780 --> 02:25:02.980]   It was probably sleep deprivation for your 10 year anniversary on Kaleo.
[02:25:02.980 --> 02:25:05.740]   What we're going to do for you is I'm going to get all your wedding pictures.
[02:25:05.740 --> 02:25:07.980]   We're going to go to five or we're going to get the best photo.
[02:25:07.980 --> 02:25:10.020]   Not part of all that would be so good.
[02:25:10.020 --> 02:25:11.980]   It's main back on top of it.
[02:25:11.980 --> 02:25:17.020]   It might even do it before 10 year anniversary, but at least it deserves you looking proper
[02:25:17.020 --> 02:25:18.020]   for her.
[02:25:18.020 --> 02:25:19.020]   She deserves this uncle.
[02:25:19.020 --> 02:25:21.380]   We got a photo shop and we had a monkey Afro.
[02:25:21.380 --> 02:25:22.380]   One of them.
[02:25:22.380 --> 02:25:23.380]   You know what I mean?
[02:25:23.380 --> 02:25:26.140]   I'm going to get me one kind of a dumb kind of a dumb thing to agree to.
[02:25:26.140 --> 02:25:27.140]   I have to admit.
[02:25:27.140 --> 02:25:29.140]   In the moment.
[02:25:29.140 --> 02:25:30.140]   In the moment.
[02:25:30.140 --> 02:25:31.940]   Hey, that's the rationale.
[02:25:31.940 --> 02:25:33.100]   I did it for you.
[02:25:33.100 --> 02:25:33.940]   I did it for you to stuff.
[02:25:33.940 --> 02:25:34.940]   I did it for the children.
[02:25:34.940 --> 02:25:35.940]   It did.
[02:25:35.940 --> 02:25:39.580]   And you just were in the moment and said, listen, if we get this many people, I'll do
[02:25:39.580 --> 02:25:40.580]   this.
[02:25:40.580 --> 02:25:44.260]   And then you went and guess what?
[02:25:44.260 --> 02:25:45.260]   You want to see it.
[02:25:45.260 --> 02:25:47.100]   You want to see a terrible picture?
[02:25:47.100 --> 02:25:48.100]   Yes.
[02:25:48.100 --> 02:25:49.100]   Yes.
[02:25:49.100 --> 02:25:51.580]   I do not have a good head shape.
[02:25:51.580 --> 02:25:53.060]   I do not have a good head shape.
[02:25:53.060 --> 02:25:54.060]   I'm just saying.
[02:25:54.060 --> 02:25:55.060]   It's a little bit angry.
[02:25:55.060 --> 02:25:56.060]   Lisa looks a little bit angry.
[02:25:56.060 --> 02:25:58.140]   Like I can't believe.
[02:25:58.140 --> 02:25:59.540]   She's looking at that head.
[02:25:59.540 --> 02:26:03.620]   She said, the real problem was I look like her uncle Bob.
[02:26:03.620 --> 02:26:05.580]   Oh, we're at the hedgecock.
[02:26:05.580 --> 02:26:06.580]   We're in the hedgecock.
[02:26:06.580 --> 02:26:08.540]   It's a little hedgecocky, isn't it?
[02:26:08.540 --> 02:26:09.540]   That is the worst.
[02:26:09.540 --> 02:26:10.540]   That's true.
[02:26:10.540 --> 02:26:11.540]   So embarrassed.
[02:26:11.540 --> 02:26:13.860]   She looks beautiful though.
[02:26:13.860 --> 02:26:14.860]   She looks beautiful.
[02:26:14.860 --> 02:26:16.520]   She looks amazing.
[02:26:16.520 --> 02:26:18.060]   She looked good even if she shaved her head.
[02:26:18.060 --> 02:26:19.060]   She looked gorgeous.
[02:26:19.060 --> 02:26:23.820]   We're about to just Photoshop two Lisa's face to face and just like that.
[02:26:23.820 --> 02:26:26.660]   And I'm clearly near Lisa doubled up.
[02:26:26.660 --> 02:26:28.620]   It's depressing as well.
[02:26:28.620 --> 02:26:29.620]   Two things for you.
[02:26:29.620 --> 02:26:30.620]   Get out of here.
[02:26:30.620 --> 02:26:33.100]   The PS5's new VR set looks great.
[02:26:33.100 --> 02:26:34.100]   What do you think?
[02:26:34.100 --> 02:26:35.100]   Are you going to get that?
[02:26:35.100 --> 02:26:36.100]   Should I get that?
[02:26:36.100 --> 02:26:37.100]   Yes, you should.
[02:26:37.100 --> 02:26:38.100]   I'm definitely getting it.
[02:26:38.100 --> 02:26:40.780]   I waited because I didn't get it for the PS4 because I was wearing it for PS5.
[02:26:40.780 --> 02:26:43.380]   So now that those controllers look sexy and they're black.
[02:26:43.380 --> 02:26:49.660]   But then it doesn't matter if you have 120 Hertz TV or you were in visors.
[02:26:49.660 --> 02:26:51.420]   You better buy that boy that TV.
[02:26:51.420 --> 02:26:52.440]   It will matter.
[02:26:52.440 --> 02:26:54.440]   Because you're not going to be in VR life.
[02:26:54.440 --> 02:26:55.440]   It's a real time.
[02:26:55.440 --> 02:26:59.380]   Just to make that much of a difference.
[02:26:59.380 --> 02:27:06.340]   Look, I'm telling you, my daughter looked at me when we put in that new TV and she said,
[02:27:06.340 --> 02:27:07.340]   this is PS5.
[02:27:07.340 --> 02:27:11.900]   Like I've been playing it on a nice TV like a big TV like a good TV.
[02:27:11.900 --> 02:27:13.900]   But it looks that much better.
[02:27:13.900 --> 02:27:14.900]   All right.
[02:27:14.900 --> 02:27:15.900]   120 Hertz.
[02:27:15.900 --> 02:27:16.900]   It just does.
[02:27:16.900 --> 02:27:17.900]   I asked Amazon.
[02:27:17.900 --> 02:27:18.900]   I already did it.
[02:27:18.900 --> 02:27:22.260]   I asked Amazon to cancel the other one and I ordered the cue thing.
[02:27:22.260 --> 02:27:23.260]   So I said that order.
[02:27:23.260 --> 02:27:29.360]   And then, yes, see, look, and then also on top of that, Mark Zuckerberg upset all the
[02:27:29.360 --> 02:27:30.360]   time.
[02:27:30.360 --> 02:27:31.880]   You don't like what Apple's doing?
[02:27:31.880 --> 02:27:32.880]   Yeah.
[02:27:32.880 --> 02:27:34.240]   So I'm listening.
[02:27:34.240 --> 02:27:38.040]   So Mark Zuckerberg was in clubhouse along with a bunch of people.
[02:27:38.040 --> 02:27:39.960]   It's like a big deal.
[02:27:39.960 --> 02:27:42.920]   And I noticed it and I went in there and I started listening.
[02:27:42.920 --> 02:27:46.080]   I should have recorded it or something because apparently it was huge news.
[02:27:46.080 --> 02:27:48.680]   I got so bored.
[02:27:48.680 --> 02:27:49.680]   I just left.
[02:27:49.680 --> 02:27:51.960]   It's like, this is boring.
[02:27:51.960 --> 02:27:53.960]   And then it's like news everywhere.
[02:27:53.960 --> 02:27:57.020]   Mark Zuckerberg criticizes Apple on clubhouse.
[02:27:57.020 --> 02:28:01.700]   He was there with Daniel, like the CEO of Spotify.
[02:28:01.700 --> 02:28:03.580]   And I stopped listening because I was bored.
[02:28:03.580 --> 02:28:05.140]   What do I know?
[02:28:05.140 --> 02:28:06.500]   No, clubhouse is weird.
[02:28:06.500 --> 02:28:07.500]   Like I don't like it.
[02:28:07.500 --> 02:28:11.020]   I can't remember when the clock in and people keep asking me to come into it.
[02:28:11.020 --> 02:28:15.280]   And it's either like you're trying to sell me cat food for a dog in your marketing book
[02:28:15.280 --> 02:28:18.380]   program that you just started with your sister four weeks ago.
[02:28:18.380 --> 02:28:22.580]   Or you're telling me that you're some guru when you're just regurgitating press release
[02:28:22.580 --> 02:28:23.580]   stuff.
[02:28:23.580 --> 02:28:29.860]   You know, this one in particular sounded like this, you know, when awkward nerds get together
[02:28:29.860 --> 02:28:34.420]   like at a dance and they're trying to make conversation, but they're not very good at
[02:28:34.420 --> 02:28:35.420]   it.
[02:28:35.420 --> 02:28:37.660]   It's just kind of really low energy and flat.
[02:28:37.660 --> 02:28:39.180]   This is exactly what that was.
[02:28:39.180 --> 02:28:42.620]   I felt like it was an high school dance with a bunch of awkward nerds.
[02:28:42.620 --> 02:28:44.220]   A lot of those rooms are really cool.
[02:28:44.220 --> 02:28:50.780]   Clubhouse and I've had some really great experiences of like really dynamic people that are again,
[02:28:50.780 --> 02:28:54.900]   big YouTubers and and it was actually kind of fun and nice.
[02:28:54.900 --> 02:28:59.420]   And it was like being on like a call with a whole bunch of other people talking about,
[02:28:59.420 --> 02:29:00.860]   you know, what they're passionate about.
[02:29:00.860 --> 02:29:02.420]   And so I've actually had a good experience.
[02:29:02.420 --> 02:29:05.260]   Okay, you got to tell me when you're going to be a clubhouse and I won't go over there.
[02:29:05.260 --> 02:29:06.660]   I'm going to follow you.
[02:29:06.660 --> 02:29:10.060]   I'm going to follow you because I need to be where you go.
[02:29:10.060 --> 02:29:11.060]   Yeah.
[02:29:11.060 --> 02:29:12.060]   You wouldn't like it anyway.
[02:29:12.060 --> 02:29:15.300]   You're you're you're a tic-tac algorithm wouldn't be where she's at.
[02:29:15.300 --> 02:29:20.260]   You're not going to be as a lovely, vivacious Canadian.
[02:29:20.260 --> 02:29:21.980]   We're not going to be in the same way.
[02:29:21.980 --> 02:29:24.940]   No, we have a very we have a good room for you, Leo.
[02:29:24.940 --> 02:29:27.020]   Your algorithm is a sacrifice.
[02:29:27.020 --> 02:29:28.820]   No, George is not in there.
[02:29:28.820 --> 02:29:29.820]   Of course not.
[02:29:29.820 --> 02:29:31.540]   Georgia Dow, we love you.
[02:29:31.540 --> 02:29:32.540]   It's great to see you.
[02:29:32.540 --> 02:29:33.540]   I'm glad things are going.
[02:29:33.540 --> 02:29:34.540]   You do well.
[02:29:34.540 --> 02:29:37.860]   You do a YouTube now with Renee Richie called Apple talk.
[02:29:37.860 --> 02:29:42.100]   You have your own channel, which is growing fast, youtube.com/georgi-dow.
[02:29:42.100 --> 02:29:44.780]   Not really growing that fast, but.
[02:29:44.780 --> 02:29:46.700]   Well, let's make it grow fast.
[02:29:46.700 --> 02:29:48.780]   It'll pick up slowly.
[02:29:48.780 --> 02:29:50.580]   How long have you been doing it?
[02:29:50.580 --> 02:29:53.780]   It's been I think it's been a month or it's been about a month.
[02:29:53.780 --> 02:29:57.100]   Yeah, I think it's around a month, a bit four weeks or so.
[02:29:57.100 --> 02:30:03.180]   She looks like you're getting you're getting advice from Galadriel, the Elvis queen.
[02:30:03.180 --> 02:30:04.180]   Right.
[02:30:04.180 --> 02:30:06.220]   Every single shirt is more I get to now buy.
[02:30:06.220 --> 02:30:07.700]   I'm like, I have to wear different shirts.
[02:30:07.700 --> 02:30:12.020]   So they're all they're all as elfish as I can get away with.
[02:30:12.020 --> 02:30:13.020]   They're cute.
[02:30:13.020 --> 02:30:14.020]   I really like them.
[02:30:14.020 --> 02:30:15.020]   Send me other ideas.
[02:30:15.020 --> 02:30:16.580]   You have great shirt show ideas.
[02:30:16.580 --> 02:30:17.580]   Send them to me.
[02:30:17.580 --> 02:30:18.580]   Yeah.
[02:30:18.580 --> 02:30:19.580]   But it's really it's kind of fun.
[02:30:19.580 --> 02:30:22.740]   I'm doing reaction videos and then psychology videos.
[02:30:22.740 --> 02:30:24.420]   So what are you reacting to?
[02:30:24.420 --> 02:30:27.900]   I react to I've done therapy scenes.
[02:30:27.900 --> 02:30:30.940]   I've done the stages of grief in WandaVision.
[02:30:30.940 --> 02:30:34.820]   I did the winter soldiers, sopranos, kerbier enthusiasm.
[02:30:34.820 --> 02:30:40.140]   I don't know if that's out yet and I'm going to I'm thinking and you guys send me tweet
[02:30:40.140 --> 02:30:44.780]   me ideas, but I'm thinking of doing the Merkle interview and I will react to it.
[02:30:44.780 --> 02:30:49.940]   So you're watching WandaVision and then it shows your reaction to and you don't get
[02:30:49.940 --> 02:30:52.140]   taken down for that?
[02:30:52.140 --> 02:30:53.140]   Nope.
[02:30:53.140 --> 02:30:55.860]   If I did that, I'd get taken down so fast.
[02:30:55.860 --> 02:30:58.060]   You have to like little tiny.
[02:30:58.060 --> 02:31:01.420]   I know it's fair use, but that doesn't stop them.
[02:31:01.420 --> 02:31:06.300]   I don't even want to play your video of them because they'll take me down.
[02:31:06.300 --> 02:31:07.300]   Yeah.
[02:31:07.300 --> 02:31:09.540]   Yeah, it's but it's it's kind of fun.
[02:31:09.540 --> 02:31:15.200]   I have to say it's a fun thing to be able to to go through and and take what is the psychology
[02:31:15.200 --> 02:31:16.200]   of what's happening.
[02:31:16.200 --> 02:31:17.200]   I do like that.
[02:31:17.200 --> 02:31:19.500]   A therapist reacts to one.
[02:31:19.500 --> 02:31:20.500]   Yeah.
[02:31:20.500 --> 02:31:23.860]   And you're talking this one about the stages of grief because one this is the episode of
[02:31:23.860 --> 02:31:27.940]   no spoilers, but one is going through some grief and you're talking about what she's
[02:31:27.940 --> 02:31:28.940]   going through.
[02:31:28.940 --> 02:31:29.940]   Yeah.
[02:31:29.940 --> 02:31:31.700]   They show the five stages of grief.
[02:31:31.700 --> 02:31:33.540]   So I think what is it fun?
[02:31:33.540 --> 02:31:38.140]   Yeah, they do like pretty straightforward and actually directly linearly, which is not
[02:31:38.140 --> 02:31:39.940]   really the way that steps really cool.
[02:31:39.940 --> 02:31:44.420]   But I was thinking about this is the same thing with panic attacks and Ironman like,
[02:31:44.420 --> 02:31:50.100]   I don't know, make it a little bit more fun psychology and you know, YouTube.com/jurajatow.
[02:31:50.100 --> 02:31:51.500]   It sounds like a great idea.
[02:31:51.500 --> 02:31:53.300]   I like it.
[02:31:53.300 --> 02:31:55.540]   I love it.
[02:31:55.540 --> 02:31:58.980]   Mr. O and JJ Stone, what would you like to tell people about?
[02:31:58.980 --> 02:32:03.020]   Of course, IQMZ.com is where you make your home on the internet.
[02:32:03.020 --> 02:32:05.300]   You know, you got to go to Rob next and then to me last.
[02:32:05.300 --> 02:32:06.300]   These are the rules.
[02:32:06.300 --> 02:32:07.660]   Oh, oh, I forgot.
[02:32:07.660 --> 02:32:09.100]   He's setting up.
[02:32:09.100 --> 02:32:10.100]   I forgot.
[02:32:10.100 --> 02:32:11.100]   Owen ends the show.
[02:32:11.100 --> 02:32:12.700]   I completely forgot.
[02:32:12.700 --> 02:32:16.260]   So Owen will go back to you in just a minute for your rant of the week.
[02:32:16.260 --> 02:32:19.100]   But first, thank you so much, Rob.
[02:32:19.100 --> 02:32:22.420]   It's great to see Roberto Baldwin back on our channel.
[02:32:22.420 --> 02:32:23.700]   Please don't be a stranger.
[02:32:23.700 --> 02:32:28.940]   I think you actually you actually called somebody and said, why haven't you had me on?
[02:32:28.940 --> 02:32:29.940]   And that makes me feel even worse.
[02:32:29.940 --> 02:32:35.740]   I think folks had had, you know, some folks in twin had reached out to me and I just,
[02:32:35.740 --> 02:32:41.260]   I was just so busy with a hard driver and I think we've always loved having you on.
[02:32:41.260 --> 02:32:43.580]   I think that was what happened was there.
[02:32:43.580 --> 02:32:44.580]   You were too busy.
[02:32:44.580 --> 02:32:49.420]   I'm just talking, you know, it's it was a weird situation that I don't that it doesn't
[02:32:49.420 --> 02:32:51.220]   well anyway, here I am now.
[02:32:51.220 --> 02:32:52.500]   Yeah, perfect.
[02:32:52.500 --> 02:32:53.580]   Perfect.
[02:32:53.580 --> 02:32:55.820]   So now we'll get you back soon, I hope.
[02:32:55.820 --> 02:32:57.740]   And I do want to know what's going on with you.
[02:32:57.740 --> 02:32:59.260]   Of course, the best way to do that.
[02:32:59.260 --> 02:33:05.740]   Follow him on Twitter, S T R N G W Y S strange ways without the vowels.
[02:33:05.740 --> 02:33:08.380]   Is that James Bond reference?
[02:33:08.380 --> 02:33:12.660]   It is a Smith's reference from their last album, Strange Ways Here We Come, which was
[02:33:12.660 --> 02:33:13.820]   a prison.
[02:33:13.820 --> 02:33:14.820]   And that's right.
[02:33:14.820 --> 02:33:18.820]   I think it might still be a pre you had a you had a Smith's cover band.
[02:33:18.820 --> 02:33:20.620]   No, no, no, no, okay.
[02:33:20.620 --> 02:33:26.460]   I have friends that are in a Smith's cover band and they're very good.
[02:33:26.460 --> 02:33:31.140]   This charming band, you should go when all this stops, you know, when we're allowed to
[02:33:31.140 --> 02:33:34.300]   go outside and see people inside, you should go see this.
[02:33:34.300 --> 02:33:35.300]   I can't wait.
[02:33:35.300 --> 02:33:38.060]   I cannot wait to see live music again.
[02:33:38.060 --> 02:33:40.100]   Your show, I'm going to make it a date.
[02:33:40.100 --> 02:33:44.260]   Your show in August and San Francisco will be my first August.
[02:33:44.260 --> 02:33:51.340]   As soon as I get the go ahead to say, yes, I will I will tweet about it.
[02:33:51.340 --> 02:33:52.340]   I'll go on the Facebook.
[02:33:52.340 --> 02:33:55.860]   Yeah, we want to make sure that we'll be open by then and it'll be allowed to have
[02:33:55.860 --> 02:33:59.540]   yeah, you know, the club is rich, I'll stop amazing club.
[02:33:59.540 --> 02:34:01.020]   They want to make sure everything's safe.
[02:34:01.020 --> 02:34:05.300]   They're a great bunch of people that run that place and they want to make sure that
[02:34:05.300 --> 02:34:08.900]   that they we do it in a safe and responsible way.
[02:34:08.900 --> 02:34:12.820]   And then once we've said we can do it, then we'll be very irresponsible, jumping around
[02:34:12.820 --> 02:34:14.660]   on stage and seeing it very loud.
[02:34:14.660 --> 02:34:15.660]   Lisa and I can't wait.
[02:34:15.660 --> 02:34:17.820]   Oh, I know exactly where it is on fell street.
[02:34:17.820 --> 02:34:18.820]   I know where that is.
[02:34:18.820 --> 02:34:19.820]   Yeah.
[02:34:19.820 --> 02:34:21.620]   Used to live on Page Street.
[02:34:21.620 --> 02:34:22.620]   Oh, nice.

[02:35:18.780 --> 02:35:23.460]   First things first, make sure you go to Twit and follow Hansel Photography because it's
[02:35:23.460 --> 02:35:24.620]   killing these streets.
[02:35:24.620 --> 02:35:28.460]   And I have lovely photography gear for one day when he allows me to be on the show even
[02:35:28.460 --> 02:35:31.300]   though he's mad at me for not using most of my technology.
[02:35:31.300 --> 02:35:33.300]   It's a good job, Matt.
[02:35:33.300 --> 02:35:34.300]   He loves you.
[02:35:34.300 --> 02:35:35.300]   I agree.
[02:35:35.300 --> 02:35:36.300]   It's a great show.
[02:35:36.300 --> 02:35:37.300]   You read the tweets.
[02:35:37.300 --> 02:35:38.300]   He's yelling at me all the time.
[02:35:38.300 --> 02:35:41.460]   But if you are a photographer, which every single person listens to this because you've got
[02:35:41.460 --> 02:35:44.740]   a phone in your pocket, you're a photographer, you should check it out.
[02:35:44.740 --> 02:35:46.940]   Secondly, Lisa, I was not joking.
[02:35:46.940 --> 02:35:48.380]   We are doing Twitter after dark.
[02:35:48.380 --> 02:35:49.380]   Come and get me.
[02:35:49.380 --> 02:35:50.380]   I'm here waiting for you.
[02:35:50.380 --> 02:35:51.380]   Don't talk to Leo.
[02:35:51.380 --> 02:35:52.380]   He's not right.
[02:35:52.380 --> 02:35:53.380]   I know who's.
[02:35:53.380 --> 02:35:54.380]   You know who launches shows here.
[02:35:54.380 --> 02:35:56.860]   And I mean, I know that come talk to you.
[02:35:56.860 --> 02:35:59.380]   Let's get that done.
[02:35:59.380 --> 02:36:05.660]   Thirdly, Georgia on record for public consumption at some point one day in the future near or
[02:36:05.660 --> 02:36:07.780]   far, we are going to be doing a show together.
[02:36:07.780 --> 02:36:08.980]   It's going to be so much fun.
[02:36:08.980 --> 02:36:11.900]   You should follow one of us on Twitter and then tell that other one that we should do
[02:36:11.900 --> 02:36:13.460]   the show sooner.
[02:36:13.460 --> 02:36:16.300]   Don't bother too much because she's super busy, but just tell her how much you would
[02:36:16.300 --> 02:36:18.580]   love a show between her and I.
[02:36:18.580 --> 02:36:19.660]   It starts getting hunched.
[02:36:19.660 --> 02:36:21.060]   The banter will be amazing.
[02:36:21.060 --> 02:36:22.500]   So just bother her about that randomly.
[02:36:22.500 --> 02:36:23.500]   I appreciate you.
[02:36:23.500 --> 02:36:24.500]   And it's funny.
[02:36:24.500 --> 02:36:28.060]   The chat room was going was already doing that, by the way.
[02:36:28.060 --> 02:36:29.460]   I know I'm egging them on.
[02:36:29.460 --> 02:36:30.460]   I want more of this.
[02:36:30.460 --> 02:36:33.580]   I like what the chat room is doing and I'm pushing them forward.
[02:36:33.580 --> 02:36:36.420]   And lastly, I haven't been on the shows this like before Christmas.
[02:36:36.420 --> 02:36:37.420]   I think they forgot about me.
[02:36:37.420 --> 02:36:38.420]   I'm in a black room.
[02:36:38.420 --> 02:36:39.420]   I don't know.
[02:36:39.420 --> 02:36:40.420]   I can't be seen.
[02:36:40.420 --> 02:36:44.300]   But if you've made it so far this year and you saw her paying your car note and you're
[02:36:44.300 --> 02:36:48.300]   still paying your bills and your kids are still fed, give yourself a pattern back.
[02:36:48.300 --> 02:36:53.340]   It has been a rough 12 months for every single person on the planet.
[02:36:53.340 --> 02:36:54.540]   So note that you're not alone.
[02:36:54.540 --> 02:36:58.940]   Note that everybody else except for Jeff Bezos is going through the same kind of crap that
[02:36:58.940 --> 02:36:59.940]   you are.
[02:36:59.940 --> 02:37:02.220]   So give yourself a pattern back for going through it.
[02:37:02.220 --> 02:37:06.500]   And if you know anybody with kids or your kids, make sure you show them articles like
[02:37:06.500 --> 02:37:10.020]   we were talking about earlier to keep them on the straight and narrow on the Internet.
[02:37:10.020 --> 02:37:13.980]   If you don't have kids, you're an uncle or an aunt, that is your job and responsibility
[02:37:13.980 --> 02:37:17.680]   to show them those articles and keep these kids in line and give them the help that they
[02:37:17.680 --> 02:37:20.300]   desperately deserve and need that they're not getting from schools.
[02:37:20.300 --> 02:37:26.580]   I'm your boy when JJ Stone, a K A O doctor, and another twit is in the can.
[02:37:26.580 --> 02:37:39.820]   And whatever you do, never go to that second location.
[02:37:39.820 --> 02:37:45.260]   Zack Snyder, the Zack Snyder twit, re-cut everything's yes.
[02:37:45.260 --> 02:37:47.700]   That whole move like free free hours that movie is slow.
[02:37:47.700 --> 02:37:48.700]   That's why so long.
[02:37:48.700 --> 02:37:49.700]   Yeah.
[02:37:49.700 --> 02:37:52.940]   I loved it.
[02:37:52.940 --> 02:37:54.340]   I have to say I did not.
[02:37:54.340 --> 02:37:56.020]   Did you watch all of it?
[02:37:56.020 --> 02:37:59.300]   Well, in several settings, Lisa and I watched it.
[02:37:59.300 --> 02:38:01.300]   I am I watch all in one sitting.
[02:38:01.300 --> 02:38:05.020]   I'm a DC nerd and I loved it because you know what?
[02:38:05.020 --> 02:38:06.020]   Really?
[02:38:06.020 --> 02:38:09.340]   Conversations explanations.
[02:38:09.340 --> 02:38:12.220]   We just had cut scenes and jump scenes and people wearing.
[02:38:12.220 --> 02:38:13.460]   It got canned the first time.
[02:38:13.460 --> 02:38:15.180]   I didn't see the first one.
[02:38:15.180 --> 02:38:16.900]   I saw the first one.
[02:38:16.900 --> 02:38:19.020]   People didn't like the first Justice League.
[02:38:19.020 --> 02:38:24.420]   I watched the first one on I watched I typically watch bat I well before, you know, everything
[02:38:24.420 --> 02:38:25.420]   is happening right now.
[02:38:25.420 --> 02:38:30.300]   I used to fly a lot for my job and I would hold bad movies for planes.
[02:38:30.300 --> 02:38:31.300]   Right.
[02:38:31.300 --> 02:38:32.300]   Let me go.
[02:38:32.300 --> 02:38:33.300]   I don't want to waste my.
[02:38:33.300 --> 02:38:34.300]   Yes.
[02:38:34.300 --> 02:38:35.300]   Exactly.
[02:38:35.300 --> 02:38:36.300]   Yes.
[02:38:36.300 --> 02:38:37.300]   On bad movies.
[02:38:37.300 --> 02:38:39.740]   So I watched the Justice League on a plane and it was.
[02:38:39.740 --> 02:38:40.740]   Yeah.
[02:38:40.740 --> 02:38:44.380]   And then I watched the other one today and I'm going to I'm just going to I don't want
[02:38:44.380 --> 02:38:45.380]   to yuck your yum.
[02:38:45.380 --> 02:38:47.340]   So I'll be quiet.
[02:38:47.340 --> 02:38:50.020]   Did you think it was worse than the original or better?
[02:38:50.020 --> 02:38:51.020]   I don't think it was worse than the original.
[02:38:51.020 --> 02:38:53.940]   I just don't think either of them are very good movies.
[02:38:53.940 --> 02:38:56.820]   But I so so I'm going to back up a little bit.
[02:38:56.820 --> 02:38:57.820]   No, no, no.
[02:38:57.820 --> 02:39:00.260]   I am a film student.
[02:39:00.260 --> 02:39:04.300]   I'm a film student and I originally wanted to be a screenwriter.
[02:39:04.300 --> 02:39:05.300]   Yeah.
[02:39:05.300 --> 02:39:07.300]   And I get so angry at so many things.
[02:39:07.300 --> 02:39:08.300]   I like to do that.
[02:39:08.300 --> 02:39:11.180]   I want to hear this because that's good.
[02:39:11.180 --> 02:39:12.620]   I am not a comic book movie.
[02:39:12.620 --> 02:39:15.820]   I hate comic books and I hate the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
[02:39:15.820 --> 02:39:17.860]   I can't I tried to watch one division.
[02:39:17.860 --> 02:39:24.540]   It's not for me because like you Owen, I believe there's really only two superheroes.
[02:39:24.540 --> 02:39:27.940]   There's Batman and there's Superman.
[02:39:27.940 --> 02:39:30.140]   Everything else is a cheesy clone.
[02:39:30.140 --> 02:39:31.620]   I love all heroes.
[02:39:31.620 --> 02:39:33.740]   My thing is that it's a cartoon.
[02:39:33.740 --> 02:39:35.740]   It's a comic book realized.
[02:39:35.740 --> 02:39:39.540]   And so when people act like it's not it's not Shawshain Redemption and it's never going
[02:39:39.540 --> 02:39:40.540]   to be.
[02:39:40.540 --> 02:39:41.540]   I don't know.
[02:39:41.540 --> 02:39:45.860]   Iron Man is still not like the greatest film on earth.
[02:39:45.860 --> 02:39:48.620]   I don't like Zack Snyder because I like 300 a lot.
[02:39:48.620 --> 02:39:50.580]   I thought 300 was great.
[02:39:50.580 --> 02:39:54.380]   I don't I don't go into these movies thinking that I'm going to come out with a 12 pack.
[02:39:54.380 --> 02:39:55.380]   Okay.
[02:39:55.380 --> 02:39:57.900]   I go in to see people and jump all things and laser.
[02:39:57.900 --> 02:39:59.860]   I get that with some.
[02:39:59.860 --> 02:40:00.860]   Henry Cavill.
[02:40:00.860 --> 02:40:01.860]   Henry Cavill.
[02:40:01.860 --> 02:40:02.860]   Quite the 12 pack.
[02:40:02.860 --> 02:40:03.860]   He's okay.
[02:40:03.860 --> 02:40:04.860]   He's acceptable.
[02:40:04.860 --> 02:40:08.020]   Do you think that was real Georgia?
[02:40:08.020 --> 02:40:10.820]   That was that was not real.
[02:40:10.820 --> 02:40:14.260]   That was like a CGI really he had a mustache.
[02:40:14.260 --> 02:40:16.340]   He's already quite well built.
[02:40:16.340 --> 02:40:19.460]   So like talk about what kind of standards we're putting men under now.
[02:40:19.460 --> 02:40:20.940]   There's at one point there.
[02:40:20.940 --> 02:40:27.260]   There's a cord field and Amy Adams is just lovingly touching his chest and I'm thinking
[02:40:27.260 --> 02:40:30.060]   she's getting a lady boner right now.
[02:40:30.060 --> 02:40:33.700]   That's pretty special right there what she's got.
[02:40:33.700 --> 02:40:36.700]   I do.
[02:40:36.700 --> 02:40:37.700]   I do.
[02:40:37.700 --> 02:40:40.180]   The standing in the court.
[02:40:40.180 --> 02:40:43.140]   And I love explosions and whatnot.
[02:40:43.140 --> 02:40:46.540]   I just don't like bad writing and I feel like there's a lot of yeah.
[02:40:46.540 --> 02:40:51.020]   So what was the most so you have learned how to agree with you with bad writing like sometimes
[02:40:51.020 --> 02:40:55.060]   you'll hear a line and it's like by the way I'll give you an example.
[02:40:55.060 --> 02:40:58.620]   Everybody loves the five bloods the new Spike Lee and I'm a Spike Lee fan.
[02:40:58.620 --> 02:41:03.580]   That is the worst written movie he's got these great actors and it sounds wooden because
[02:41:03.580 --> 02:41:05.140]   the writing isn't very good.
[02:41:05.140 --> 02:41:06.140]   Do you agree?
[02:41:06.140 --> 02:41:07.140]   Have you seen it yet?
[02:41:07.140 --> 02:41:08.140]   I haven't seen it yet.
[02:41:08.140 --> 02:41:11.420]   Okay again I want to harsh your mellow you should watch it and then have your own watch.
[02:41:11.420 --> 02:41:16.020]   You know what I watch the Justice League I've watched all those acts night or movies I get
[02:41:16.020 --> 02:41:17.020]   a chance every time.
[02:41:17.020 --> 02:41:18.020]   I don't know.
[02:41:18.020 --> 02:41:19.820]   I like the music watching Rocky.
[02:41:19.820 --> 02:41:23.420]   I don't know why we're talking about movies because he's a.
[02:41:23.420 --> 02:41:24.420]   I'm sorry.
[02:41:24.420 --> 02:41:25.420]   No, no, not him.
[02:41:25.420 --> 02:41:26.420]   I'm talking about you Leo.
[02:41:26.420 --> 02:41:27.420]   Okay.
[02:41:27.420 --> 02:41:29.020]   You want to know what I like?
[02:41:29.020 --> 02:41:31.060]   You haven't watched Rocky?
[02:41:31.060 --> 02:41:32.740]   I've seen it now.
[02:41:32.740 --> 02:41:33.740]   Okay.
[02:41:33.740 --> 02:41:35.620]   But I know how many of them.
[02:41:35.620 --> 02:41:38.540]   No, just I saw part of the first one and that was enough.
[02:41:38.540 --> 02:41:42.300]   I don't know why you got those little cow you didn't even watch it.
