[00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.180]   This is Twit.

[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.580]   This is Twit, this weekend tech.
[00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.980]   Episode 78 for November 26, 2006, the War Axe Restaurant.
[00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.140]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.300]   This weekend tech is brought to you by Dell.
[00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.180]   Visit Leo's pics for some great deals on Dell, desktops,

[00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:51.340]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.220]   Time for another fabulous edition of Twit with once again
[00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.820]   the core group of Twitters and an old friend.
[00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.500]   First let me introduce John Seidorak.org/blocks
[00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.900]   that Alec and Adam Curry won't tune out.
[00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.900]   As you know, Adam only listens if John is on the show.
[00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:08.820]   Thank you, smart guy.
[00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.660]   I always enjoy hitting two.
[00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.500]   Got good taste.
[00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.420]   Also on the-- actually I was going to say on the line,
[00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.420]   but in the studio today is Mr. Patrick Norton.
[00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.940]   Just enjoying the drive up in the rain.
[00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.700]   Why did you do that?
[00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.100]   You know, do you ever say to yourself,
[00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.900]   I've been sorting through paperwork for four hours,
[00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:25.500]   no one will leave.
[00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.860]   I'm going to stretch my legs.
[00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.660]   Stretch my-- and wash the dust, the Baja 500 dust off your truck
[00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:31.220]   probably.
[00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.780]   There's still about 400 pounds of it buried in every nook
[00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:34.280]   and crayon.
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.740]   Is it really?
[00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:35.060]   Yeah.
[00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.540]   It really gets in there.
[00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.900]   In ways that we really don't need to discuss on that much
[00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.900]   show.
[00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.580]   On your nooks and crannies.
[00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.100]   All of the nooks and truck me and the bags to close.
[00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.100]   Ow.
[00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.020]   Also here at the old friend, and it's
[00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.540]   Tom Merritt who for many years ran the website at TechTV,
[00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.980]   and is now at CNET, and one of the hosts of Buzz Out Loud.
[00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:01.900]   I just did Buzz Out Loud on Wednesday with Tom and Molly
[00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.220]   and the great Veronica.
[00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.620]   And it was so much fun.
[00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.340]   And I'm just glad to get you on again, Tom.
[00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.300]   You haven't been on since the alkaline edition of Twit.
[00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.820]   Oh, yeah.
[00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.100]   It was in the studio there at Over on Second Street.
[00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.100]   Golden Gate.
[00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.780]   Was it Second Street?
[00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:15.780]   Yeah.
[00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:16.280]   Yeah.
[00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.780]   Hey--
[00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.820]   Of course, you sounded a lot better on Buzz Out Loud
[00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:19.820]   than I sound right now.
[00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:23.420]   Well, that's because you guys at CNET have professional gear.
[00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.620]   Well, no, it's because you have it I as the end line.
[00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:26.620]   Yeah.
[00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:27.620]   That's not--
[00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.380]   That's crappy, sure, Mike.
[00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.900]   One of these days, the problem is that I'd
[00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.180]   love to get Patrick and John and everybody in ISDN line,
[00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.540]   but that would mean I would have to have an ISDN line for each person.
[00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:39.060]   Oh, wow.
[00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.460]   And an ISDN box in here.
[00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:45.780]   That would mean for me, these boxes are $7,000.
[00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.260]   So that's a fairly hefty outline.
[00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.180]   Well, plus the charm of actually having to get Pac Bell out here.
[00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.300]   I need to 11 ISDN lines.
[00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.300]   Yeah.
[00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:54.140]   I'll start working.
[00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.060]   You need what?
[00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.060]   Yeah, and yeah.
[00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.180]   It just-- it kind of grabs me a little bit because you would think it--
[00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.740]   you know, you get a T3 or something or a T1.
[00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:05.580]   But there's nothing like a point-to-point line.
[00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.140]   There's no elatency.
[00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.060]   So Adam Curry was going to join us in his pink jumper and his pink sunglasses.
[00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.860]   But he couldn't make it.
[00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:13.620]   He did take me up.
[00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.140]   Remember we talked about him last week.
[00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.220]   Sorry, that sounds like a easy top song.
[00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.260]   He's got jumper.
[00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:20.820]   He knows.
[00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.980]   I offered Curry a crisp.
[00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.980]   And I see-- Patrick, you'll verify this.
[00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.420]   I'm holding it in my hands.
[00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:27.260]   $20 bill.
[00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.260]   A recent edition.
[00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:29.260]   US currency.
[00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:30.260]   Very nice.
[00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.740]   But he-- and he said-- he sent me an email the next day.
[00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.260]   So he's got spies who listen to this show, obviously.
[00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.140]   And maybe he even listens to it.
[00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:39.820]   And he said, I would love to be on.
[00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:40.820]   I'm going to be in San Francisco.
[00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.020]   And unfortunately, he is on a plane flying back to Britain.
[00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:47.060]   So maybe next week we'll get the kid, the Curry kid.
[00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.900]   Did you hear what he did?
[00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.460]   He did some fun stuff with us.
[00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:51.100]   Did John, did you hear it?
[00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.340]   No, I know nothing.
[00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:54.940]   Well, you're on it.
[00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:02.540]   On the Daily Source Code episode 501, I think it is.
[00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.100]   He plays a clip from it of us talking about him.
[00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.780]   Yeah, I think he left out the part where I call it.
[00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.740]   He looked like Grandpa Munster, though.
[00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:10.220]   Not that bad.
[00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:11.540]   He does look like Grandpa Munster.
[00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:12.780]   I was going to say.
[00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.380]   Top Stories of the Week.
[00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:15.660]   Let's run through them.
[00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.980]   Should we start with Michael Richards, Kramer?
[00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.340]   Did you see his tirade?
[00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.900]   Yeah, actually it's on the devore.org/blog site.
[00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.500]   You can click right on it and you'd get a stitcher right there.
[00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.260]   You know who's getting a big benefit from this is TMZ, which is the gossip site that
[00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:32.260]   has the video.
[00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:33.260]   Oh, yeah.
[00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:37.460]   Everywhere you see it, they've got their logo plastered right across the screen.
[00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.060]   So I watched it for the first time yesterday.
[00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.900]   Whoa, stand back.
[00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.420]   He was out of control.
[00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:48.260]   What was we also have the apology on Letterman on the blog?
[00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:49.260]   Right.
[00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.580]   Which was less inadequate, though, say.
[00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.140]   He looks like it doesn't look right.
[00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:56.140]   Something's right on it.
[00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:58.180]   I think he's sincere about his apology.
[00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.620]   I mean, he looked really torn up, but I don't think there's any excuse for it.
[00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:03.620]   It's too late.
[00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:04.620]   It's too late.
[00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.020]   The only reason I bring it up, I mean, really isn't a tech story.
[00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.060]   It's a celebrity gossip story, but the reason I bring it up is that in days gone by without
[00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.380]   the internet, this might not have had lasted that long.
[00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.140]   It might not have not that many people have seen it.
[00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:18.060]   It's certainly not something you could really err on TV.
[00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:21.540]   It was so appallingly repulsive.
[00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:24.220]   But it sure got aired on the internet.
[00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:25.220]   So what's the story?
[00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.780]   I mean, some friends of Israel in the front row heckling him.
[00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:28.780]   I don't know if they're friends.
[00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:29.780]   I think they were--
[00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:32.820]   No, they were up in the background, the second decor, the second decor.
[00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:34.580]   He was looking up in the air.
[00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:38.220]   And there was a couple of black guys that were heckling him, and then they were talking
[00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:39.220]   to each other.
[00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.220]   Apparently, he explained it on Letterman's show, Kinda.
[00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:46.100]   And then he got fed up with these guys, and instead of doing the standard stock routines
[00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:47.660]   that most of these guys do with hecklers--
[00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:49.660]   I remember my first beer.
[00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:50.660]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:05:50.660 --> 00:06:00.180]   He freaked out and essentially lost control and made a fool of himself.
[00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:02.620]   It almost looks like he had a psychotic break, to be honest.
[00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:04.020]   I mean, he's more than just a freak out.
[00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:05.020]   I mean, he just flipped.
[00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:11.220]   He flipped his lid and used the N word, used every expletive.
[00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:13.100]   But I said some extremely racist things.
[00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:16.140]   Now, what's interesting if you watch this video is you see people getting up and leaving.
[00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:19.260]   There's some chuckling, but there's also people going, "Oh my God," and leaving.
[00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260]   At the end of the video, they all leave.
[00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.780]   Well, they didn't want to be there when the bullets started flying.
[00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:24.780]   No kidding.
[00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:27.100]   I don't blame them.
[00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:28.740]   Do you think this is the kind of thing that would have--
[00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:30.660]   I think this is the kind of--
[00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:31.660]   Well, you know what?
[00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:33.180]   It looked like a riot was about to ensue.
[00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:35.140]   People were very, very upset.
[00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:37.660]   They were this close to storming the stage from the video.
[00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:41.740]   Yeah, I think half the audience was stunned and half the audience was just all in their
[00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:42.740]   way around.
[00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:43.740]   Yeah.
[00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:47.740]   Do you think this would have had the legs it's had without the internet?
[00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:51.740]   Well, you know, the Mel Gibson thing has no internet--
[00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:53.500]   Because there's no video.
[00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:54.740]   Right, there's nothing.
[00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:56.340]   But it's gotten-- it had a lot of legs.
[00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:58.860]   So I'm not sure that, you know, you may be wrong here.
[00:06:58.860 --> 00:06:59.860]   I mean--
[00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:00.860]   You may have been so appalled.
[00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:02.780]   Now, that is sad.
[00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:10.260]   The possibility exists that because the Kramer guy at Richards is not on the same league,
[00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:15.300]   in the same league as Mel Gibson, that it may have died on the vine because it's not
[00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:16.300]   as interesting.
[00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:21.140]   And the other story with the Gibson anti-Semitism has some history to meet.
[00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:24.220]   And would it make a difference that Gibson was involved with police?
[00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:26.180]   And so you tend to believe the story.
[00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:30.220]   Whereas with Richards, he was in a club, I'm sure if people didn't see it, at least before
[00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:32.420]   I saw it, you think, oh, well, hecklers--
[00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:33.420]   Right.
[00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:34.420]   --stay stuff.
[00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:35.420]   He probably didn't say anything as bad as they're saying he said.
[00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:36.420]   Right.
[00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:38.780]   And when you can actually see it, you're like, "Man, it's what I'm supposed to do."
[00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:39.780]   Well, you know, this--
[00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:42.780]   I mean, this stuff though has been around as long as there's been mass media and gossip
[00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:43.780]   columnists.
[00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:44.780]   Sure.
[00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:45.780]   There's this kind of stuff has always had legs.
[00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:49.500]   But I guess my point is that now that you can put it up on YouTube and millions of people
[00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:55.740]   can see it, it has-- look, I'm also thinking about the poor football players on the sidelines
[00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:58.020]   picking his nose and eating it.
[00:07:58.020 --> 00:07:59.620]   And everybody sees that on.
[00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:03.780]   Now, that would have had no currency except for that 100,000 people saw it on YouTube.
[00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:08.060]   But I'm wondering now that there's cameras everywhere and there's this distribution medium
[00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:10.180]   that's easy to use and free.
[00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:11.620]   Is privacy dead?
[00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:14.340]   I mean, no matter what you do, you're doing it in public.
[00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:21.340]   I, right now, at my policy is to go out wearing one of those nose glasses mustache things
[00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:22.340]   when I--
[00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:23.340]   Well, that's you.
[00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:24.340]   I've seen you on YouTube.
[00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:25.580]   That was you in the coffee shop.
[00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:26.580]   I'll tell you.
[00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:29.940]   One thing you don't want to do is distribute porn in China.
[00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:35.340]   The creator of China's largest pornographic website jailed for life on Wednesday, according
[00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:36.340]   to Sinhua.
[00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:39.820]   I'm going to put a stop to it.
[00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:45.180]   He handed down life sentences to this guy and then in terms of 13 months to 10 years to
[00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:49.260]   eight others convicted of profiting from pornographic dissemination.
[00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.380]   They should be given these guys awards.
[00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:53.540]   They should be getting-- no.
[00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:56.460]   What's-- you know, China's always whining about population control.
[00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:57.460]   We need fewer people.
[00:08:57.460 --> 00:08:58.460]   Great.
[00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:00.460]   Let them view porn and sit in dark corners.
[00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:01.460]   Good point.
[00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:02.460]   It's good point.
[00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:06.020]   I think that deserves a memo, Patrick.
[00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:09.820]   You should send one to the Chinese Ministry of Culture immediately.
[00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:11.700]   This is quite an amazing site.
[00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:17.940]   Apparently, according to Sinhua again, the site contained more than 9 million pornographic
[00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:18.940]   images and articles.
[00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:20.100]   That can't be right.
[00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:21.100]   Why not?
[00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:23.300]   The police said 9 million?
[00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:26.700]   You got a billion people in labor.
[00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:28.740]   Somebody can put together iPods for $60.
[00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:29.740]   Nine?
[00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:30.740]   For like $50.
[00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:31.740]   You know what I think?
[00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:32.740]   There's a miserable place to work.
[00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:35.420]   I think it was a 9 megabyte file.
[00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:37.140]   And they thought it was 9 million pictures.
[00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:38.140]   I don't know.
[00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:39.980]   Wait, Patrick, you put it right, Patrick.
[00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:40.980]   That in died minutes?
[00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:41.980]   Kind of a small percentage.
[00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:43.740]   But you can get it that way.
[00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:49.580]   They opened four websites total attracting 600,000 users.
[00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:52.820]   Police found about $25,000 in the bank accounts of the 9 men.
[00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:54.860]   So I don't think they made that much money off of it.
[00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:57.700]   Yeah, but 25 grand is big money if you're staying in the right city.
[00:09:57.700 --> 00:09:58.700]   Life should have been in prison.
[00:09:58.700 --> 00:09:59.700]   Yeah, that's got it.
[00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:01.900]   And the other thing is like an Art Locothry song.
[00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:05.340]   It's like, "What are you in for?"
[00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:07.940]   Pouring and everybody slid back on the bench.
[00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:09.580]   Ooh, yeah.
[00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:10.580]   Wow.
[00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:15.340]   Plus it sort of puts the lie to the idea that China can't crack down on piracy.
[00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:16.340]   You know, that's true.
[00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:17.340]   Well, it's probably...
[00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:18.340]   They can crack down on porn.
[00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:19.340]   Why can't they crack down on piracy?
[00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:20.340]   Yeah.
[00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:21.340]   Well, which has really wanted piracy online piracy?
[00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:22.340]   I'm telling you that.
[00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:24.340]   But reference to an Arlo Guthry song.
[00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:25.340]   I was looking at it online.
[00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:27.340]   This is like a record breaker for callbacks.
[00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:30.780]   There's like nobody out there knows what you're talking about.
[00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:31.780]   Except for you.
[00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:32.780]   Wait a minute.
[00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:33.780]   It was just Thanksgiving.
[00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:34.780]   Exactly.
[00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:35.780]   It was on the front page.
[00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:38.260]   It was at the times of the journal I saw Alice.
[00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:42.460]   Let me add Will Harris because we need a Brit to really wrap this thing, to really round
[00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:43.460]   this thing out.
[00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:44.460]   That's the podcast about Alice.
[00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:45.460]   That's right.
[00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:46.780]   You can't get anything?
[00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:49.160]   Let's ask Will Harris from Oxford, England.
[00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:52.140]   Do you know what Alice's restaurant is?
[00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:53.940]   Alice's restaurant.
[00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:54.940]   Yeah.
[00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:55.940]   That's the answer.
[00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:56.940]   He answered it right there.
[00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:57.940]   He doesn't know it.
[00:10:57.940 --> 00:10:58.940]   He doesn't know it.
[00:10:58.940 --> 00:10:59.940]   Neither does anybody else knows it.
[00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:00.940]   Okay.
[00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:01.940]   We're going to moving right.
[00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:05.580]   Talk about hide button shoes.
[00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:07.260]   I got a bit of nostalgia.
[00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.860]   The Revenge of the Nerds.
[00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:18.420]   They were doing a remake of Revenge of the Nerds at Emory University.
[00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:19.420]   Emory, they started.
[00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:23.500]   I think they had two weeks of shooting.
[00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:27.740]   And then Emory University said, "We're pulling out of this project.
[00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:28.900]   No more Toga parties."
[00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:29.900]   And that's it.
[00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:30.900]   The movie's over.
[00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:31.900]   Whoops.
[00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:32.900]   Whoops.
[00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:33.900]   So there's no completion.
[00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:35.900]   What was this Revenge of the Nerds 6?
[00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:36.900]   What was it?
[00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:37.900]   The Urgent.
[00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:38.900]   There were tenities.
[00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:39.900]   There were quite a few.
[00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:42.980]   I think Van Wilders pretty much said everything on the subject at this point.
[00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:43.980]   It's over.
[00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:44.980]   Yeah.
[00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:45.980]   Okay.
[00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:46.980]   We're talking about reruns and old things.
[00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:47.980]   Has anybody checked out at least?
[00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:49.780]   I've checked out part of this.
[00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:52.460]   The Star Trek New Voyages site.
[00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:53.460]   Oh yeah.
[00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:54.460]   I've checked that out.
[00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:56.420]   I've seen every episode that made so far.
[00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:57.420]   What is it?
[00:11:57.420 --> 00:11:58.420]   How can you watch it?
[00:11:58.420 --> 00:11:59.420]   What is it?
[00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:02.220]   Because the special effects of all just like the original Star Trek.
[00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:03.660]   The special effects are really good.
[00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:05.860]   Is somebody got a salt shaker in there and doing the salsa?
[00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:06.860]   What is that sound?
[00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:10.220]   I think it's a real eating fish and chicken.
[00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:11.220]   Oh, you know what?
[00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:12.460]   That was probably my dog shaker head.
[00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:13.460]   Your dog?
[00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:14.460]   Okay.
[00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:15.460]   Scratching.
[00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:16.460]   So what is Star Trek New Voyages?
[00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:17.460]   Yeah.
[00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:21.820]   For anybody out there who wants to check this out is www.newvoyages.com or you can again go to
[00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:22.820]   the mora.
[00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:23.820]   They're taking the old shows.
[00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:25.220]   We never know the shot of whiskey.
[00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:26.220]   I said that.
[00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:27.220]   No.
[00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:29.420]   They're taking the recast, the original people.
[00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:32.620]   They got a spock and a spock and a McCoy.
[00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:33.620]   Same scripts?
[00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:34.620]   No.
[00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:35.620]   New scripts.
[00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:39.780]   They're like, this is supposedly the fifth year because they only had to show on for
[00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:40.780]   three or four years.
[00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:43.500]   They never finished a five year voyage, right?
[00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:44.580]   But this is fan fiction.
[00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:45.580]   This isn't...
[00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:46.580]   It's done.
[00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:47.580]   It's produced.
[00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:48.580]   It's actually produced.
[00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:50.780]   And I think they're probably going to release DVDs of it.
[00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:51.780]   Wow.
[00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:52.780]   And they get some decent writers.
[00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:55.420]   Some people who actually had written scripts in the past.
[00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:58.620]   Some of it's just fan writers, but they've got some real people working on it and they've
[00:12:58.620 --> 00:12:59.620]   got guest stars.
[00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:00.620]   They got George DeCane.
[00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:03.420]   It's not legal though, is it?
[00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:06.500]   I think it has the approval of the studio.
[00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:08.700]   No, they've had to have a license for this.
[00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:10.860]   There's no way they didn't get a license for this.
[00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:12.900]   They'd get busted in a minute by Paramount.
[00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:13.900]   Seriously, you think...
[00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:14.900]   Paramount would shut them down.
[00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:15.900]   They're notorious for that.
[00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:16.900]   Yeah.
[00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:21.620]   Paramount said you can do it as long as you don't sell any advertising or try to distribute
[00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:22.620]   it.
[00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:23.620]   That's good.
[00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:24.620]   And anyway, we'll let you do it.
[00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:27.420]   Very liberal with a fan fiction, again, if it's non-commercial.
[00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:29.420]   And it sure has...
[00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:30.620]   You know, Tony hasn't hurt Lucas.
[00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:32.620]   So can you watch these on the web or do you have...
[00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:34.620]   Yeah, they're on NewVuages.com.
[00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:37.940]   Yeah, you download them, Victor.
[00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:38.940]   All ahead.
[00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:39.940]   Three.
[00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:40.940]   Skydiscout.
[00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:45.540]   So when George DeCane is on it, does he do the "Sulu" thing or what?
[00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:47.780]   Yeah, he's one of those plot twists.
[00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:48.780]   Is it like Elderly?
[00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:49.780]   Elderly?
[00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:51.820]   Yeah, kind of coming back in time.
[00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:52.820]   Oh, Captain.
[00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:54.580]   I've lost my pants.
[00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:55.580]   I don't think he's...
[00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:59.140]   I don't think you do a lot of voices, but I don't think you can get any voice in that.
[00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:00.140]   George DeCane...
[00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:02.540]   Well, he's not really that deep, it's like this.
[00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:03.540]   It's kind of...
[00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:05.540]   Our Cap-a-Lot lost my pants.
[00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:07.460]   Kind of having his nose.
[00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:09.300]   Oh, Captain, I...
[00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:11.660]   Anyway, I'm not going to work on it because it's not needed.
[00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:14.660]   We have Star Trek Voyages to watch.
[00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:17.540]   It's not taking another show of whiskey for the "Leard and your Voice."
[00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:18.540]   Do you...
[00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:19.540]   Yeah.
[00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:20.540]   Do you...
[00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:24.540]   Is the Star Trek cult big in Britain or is it all Doctor Who fans?
[00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:28.580]   Well, the moment is Doctor Who because Doctor Who's on the TV.
[00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:29.580]   It was...
[00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:31.340]   Don't you call it the "Telly"?
[00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:35.020]   Well, yes, the goggle box, the boob tube.
[00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:36.020]   The "Telly"?
[00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:38.020]   Any of those things.
[00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:39.020]   All right.
[00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:40.020]   I like Mark's goggle box.
[00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:41.020]   It is more...
[00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:43.020]   It's more Doctor Who at the moment.
[00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:44.020]   Yeah.
[00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:45.020]   So...
[00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:46.020]   Hey, Lieutenant.
[00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:47.020]   Was he the original Doctor Who?
[00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:48.020]   No, he's the current one.
[00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:49.020]   He's the current one.
[00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:50.500]   I feel so out of it.
[00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:52.660]   I don't know any of this stuff.
[00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:57.500]   Microsoft Windows celebrated a birthday almost a week ago.
[00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:00.020]   It was Monday.
[00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:03.300]   Windows 1.0 was released November 20, 1985.
[00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:07.500]   It's 21 years old today if it could vote and drink.
[00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:09.220]   David Dina drink.
[00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:11.980]   You have a lot of people to drink.
[00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:12.980]   Windows 1.0.
[00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:14.380]   Do you remember 1.0, don't you, Patrick?
[00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:15.380]   Yes.
[00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:16.380]   Yeah.
[00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:20.540]   There's a brief, shiny look at a box and a quiet epitaph from my cousin and we never
[00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:21.540]   touched it.
[00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:22.540]   Really?
[00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:23.540]   I don't remember it.
[00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:24.540]   No, I...
[00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:25.540]   Lauterbach had his 1.0, I remember.
[00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:26.540]   I think Kevin Rose still had.
[00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:28.540]   I think Kevin Rose and Prager, one of those two...
[00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:29.540]   Kevin's too young.
[00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:30.540]   Kevin would have been eight.
[00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:32.820]   No, they got it on eBay or Bautielic or something.
[00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:33.820]   Oh, yeah.
[00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:34.820]   Yeah, something.
[00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:35.820]   Eight years old buying Windows 1.0.
[00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:36.820]   I don't think so.
[00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:37.820]   You never...
[00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:42.580]   I still have a PC computing magazine roundup of all the new windowing programs.
[00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:44.140]   Oh, wow.
[00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:45.140]   That's good to have.
[00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:46.140]   Yeah.
[00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:47.140]   Whatever happened to Jim?
[00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:48.140]   Jim.
[00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:49.140]   Yeah.
[00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:51.060]   21 years old and of course VISTAs on its way.
[00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:52.060]   I just...
[00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:55.140]   I have to say I bought my first VISTA computer today.
[00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:58.500]   I mean, it doesn't have VISTA on it, but I've got the Express Upgrade coupon.
[00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:00.660]   Of course, it's a Dell.
[00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:03.820]   Is it going to be like the Express to the basic version that you're going to want to spend
[00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:04.820]   the $100 to $200 stuff?
[00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:05.820]   No, it goes.
[00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:10.380]   It's XP Professional, so it'll be across grade to XP or VISTA Professional.
[00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:11.380]   Good.
[00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:13.500]   And then I'll have to pay for up to Ultimate.
[00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:14.500]   Yeah.
[00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:15.500]   Right.
[00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:16.500]   He might as well get out of the way since you mentioned Dell, Leo.
[00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:17.500]   Let's go.
[00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:18.500]   All right.
[00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:19.500]   You know, it's on our Leo's picks page.
[00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:20.500]   It's a Twit.tv/dell.
[00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:23.660]   I put the specs for the one I bought.
[00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:25.140]   I like lightweight.
[00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:28.900]   I'm a little guy and I don't like a big computer, so it's a five-pounder.
[00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:29.900]   I think it's the...
[00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:30.900]   Well, I don't think I have to go look it up.
[00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:36.540]   I think it's a 1210 and it's Core 2, 2 GHz.
[00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:37.540]   I can't wait.
[00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:39.180]   Should be here any day now.
[00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:40.180]   Yeah.
[00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:41.340]   I'm sorry.
[00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:42.340]   Am I choking you up?
[00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:43.340]   XPS.
[00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:44.340]   I thought...
[00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:45.340]   Are you okay?
[00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:46.340]   Sorry.
[00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:47.340]   I'll let it down.
[00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:49.340]   M1210, it's Intel Core 2, Duo, 2 GHz and RAM.
[00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:50.340]   That's all right.
[00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:51.740]   I have a call for it.
[00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:52.740]   I might...
[00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:54.380]   Yeah, I can hear you.
[00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:55.380]   Click it.
[00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:58.140]   Anyway, that's on the site.
[00:16:58.140 --> 00:17:02.180]   Also the new XPS that we just bought for call for help for the set on call for help.
[00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:04.300]   Kind of sad story, actually.
[00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:06.580]   I'll tell you that in a second.
[00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:07.580]   And a couple of other systems.
[00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:08.940]   It's all on the Leo's picks page.
[00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:12.140]   When you do buy a Dell, go through that page, even if you're not buying those systems and
[00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:13.500]   we'll get credit for it.
[00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:19.980]   .tv/dell, we do thank Dell for their support for this show.
[00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:21.900]   So we bought the sad story.
[00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:22.980]   Yes, sad story.
[00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:24.820]   We bought this beautiful Dell XPS.
[00:17:24.820 --> 00:17:25.820]   It came.
[00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:28.460]   By the way, we got a Mac Pro and a Dell XPS at the same time because we have to use Mac
[00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:29.460]   and Windows.
[00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:31.100]   It's been two years of time to update.
[00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:32.100]   The Mac is nice.
[00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:33.420]   I've talked about it before you open it up.
[00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:34.420]   It's beautiful.
[00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:36.540]   Dell's done some great stuff with this new XPS.
[00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:38.060]   You open it up in the same way.
[00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:41.220]   You have the one sort of the Death Star look with the red one.
[00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:42.220]   It's a beautiful.
[00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:43.220]   Awesome case.
[00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:44.220]   It's a very big case.
[00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:45.220]   It's a house.
[00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:46.220]   So is the Mac Pro.
[00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:48.540]   It's roughly the same size.
[00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:52.220]   I think they did a lot of the same nice engineering work that's really looking forward to the
[00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:53.940]   same kind of hardware in both.
[00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:58.020]   Well, it's a Xeon in the Mac Pro and it's a Core 2 Duo in the Dell.
[00:17:58.020 --> 00:18:02.100]   But the sad story is we bought this, we've got it all set up and then we got word that
[00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:07.020]   we're moving the production from Toronto to Vancouver in two months.
[00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:08.740]   So I guess we'll just leave it behind.
[00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:09.740]   In Cuba.
[00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:10.740]   Why you can't ship it?
[00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:11.740]   Is it way too much?
[00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:12.820]   I don't know if we get to keep it.
[00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:16.140]   I think that the way that the business deal was structured, we're going to be moving.
[00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:19.780]   It was produced in house by Rogers who owns Tech TV Canada.
[00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:26.660]   And they've now outsourced it to Victor Lucas who actually produces and is in Judgment Day,
[00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:28.980]   which was on G4 and electric playground.
[00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:31.540]   He has a production company in Vancouver called Greedy Productions.
[00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:33.260]   He's an independent producer.
[00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:38.740]   So I don't know if they included transfer of all of those of that hardware.
[00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:39.740]   It'd be kind of a shame.
[00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:42.500]   You shouldn't have said anything.
[00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:45.660]   They don't listen to this show.
[00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:47.260]   They don't even know what it is.
[00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:48.780]   So Vancouver is a lot better.
[00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:51.860]   Vancouver is great for me and I hope you guys will come up because it's easier.
[00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:54.860]   Vancouver is an easy, that's just a basically a community.
[00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:59.420]   You're Port Angeles, you get on the, I'm sorry, you have your secret island of solitude.
[00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:01.780]   You get on that boat and you just come right across the bay.
[00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:03.700]   Actually I take one of them.
[00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:06.900]   One of them in more bottle jump.
[00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:07.900]   Really?
[00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:08.900]   Do you fly?
[00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:11.020]   Well I mean to Vancouver, I mean to Victoria, you take a boat.
[00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:14.220]   If you want to take a boat back to Vancouver, then you have to go to Victoria, then you
[00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:15.220]   have to take a long boat.
[00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:16.220]   Whatever.
[00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:17.220]   It's forever.
[00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:18.220]   I forget it.
[00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:19.220]   It's too far.
[00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:20.220]   You have to fly.
[00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:21.220]   But do come, we'd love to get you on the show.
[00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:22.220]   Be kind of fun.
[00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:23.220]   Yeah, you say that.
[00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:24.220]   Well you think I'm lying?
[00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:25.220]   And think I'm making that up?
[00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:26.220]   No, of course you love it.
[00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:27.220]   Hey did you see this story Leo?
[00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:31.140]   The one, we just, one of my guys has put it up.
[00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:34.540]   McDonald's just patented a sandwich.
[00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:35.540]   Wow.
[00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:36.540]   They patented the sandwich.
[00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:37.540]   Which sandwich?
[00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:38.540]   What is it?
[00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:39.540]   It's called a hamburger.
[00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:40.540]   No, not a hamburger.
[00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:41.540]   They put it in a regular sandwich.
[00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:46.020]   McDonald's is going to sell regular sandwiches and they patented it.
[00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:47.900]   Oh, you mean like a sandwich sandwich?
[00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:48.900]   Like a turkey sandwich?
[00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:49.900]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:50.900]   Not like a hamburger?
[00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:51.900]   No, not a hamburger.
[00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:52.900]   It's a fitting.
[00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:53.900]   The idea.
[00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:58.140]   It was a lot to do with the toasting which is called simultaneous toast toast.
[00:19:58.140 --> 00:19:59.140]   Oh yeah, well they did.
[00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:01.260]   They've patented toasting the bread on both sides.
[00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:04.060]   Both sides at the same time which would make it simultaneous.
[00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:07.860]   And garnishes of lettuce, onions, tomatoes as well as salt, pepper and ketchup are inserted
[00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:10.540]   into a cavity in a sandwich delivery tool.
[00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:13.860]   I've just lost my appetite.
[00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:16.620]   I want a sandwich delivery tool too, Mommy.
[00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:21.460]   The bread component is placed over the cavity and the assembly tool is inserted to tip out
[00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:22.460]   the contents.
[00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:24.980]   Finally, the filling is placed in the bread component.
[00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:27.380]   You sir are a sandwich delivery tool.
[00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:28.380]   It is delicious.
[00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:32.980]   The patent explains quote, often the sandwich filling is the source of the name of the sandwich.
[00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:37.100]   For example, ham sandwich.
[00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:38.100]   This is in the patent.
[00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:40.100]   You can patent that.
[00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:41.100]   Wow.
[00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:42.100]   Well they've applied for it.
[00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:44.300]   They surely can't give out.
[00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:46.500]   Well, there is prior art, I believe.
[00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:50.740]   The question is, for the sandwich, the style of sandwich, the assembly.
[00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:51.740]   It's the process.
[00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:52.740]   The sandwich or the process.
[00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:54.980]   It's a sandwich delivery tool.
[00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:58.460]   I'm sure they have lots of patents on those strains, little machines that are running behind
[00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:01.740]   the counter that allow people that can't read to actually run what's going on.
[00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:03.980]   Oh, the buttons where they don't have words, they just have pictures?
[00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:05.740]   Well, have you ever been in the back?
[00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:07.460]   I worked at McDonald's for years.
[00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:08.900]   Do you remember what it was like?
[00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:09.900]   Years.
[00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:10.900]   It was years.
[00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:11.900]   Was it really years?
[00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:13.220]   Yeah, well, it was a summer job.
[00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:14.660]   So I'd go back every summer.
[00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:17.820]   So they figured out that I wasn't going to become a manager.
[00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:21.340]   Never made it as manager of McDonald's or just a counter boy?
[00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:22.540]   No, no, no, no.
[00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:23.820]   Give me some credit.
[00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:24.820]   I made it to closer.
[00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:26.300]   I would close the place down.
[00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:27.300]   Oh, that's big.
[00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:29.980]   We used to hose it down disinfect.
[00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:31.620]   And then you have to count the burgers.
[00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:33.060]   You can't account the waste.
[00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:36.340]   So every time they have those little timers on the burgers, I don't know if they still
[00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:38.940]   do this, but you put little timers on the burgers and after seven minutes you can't
[00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:42.740]   sell it because it's, believe me, an old McDonald's burger is old.
[00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:44.820]   It gives old a new meaning.
[00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:49.940]   And so they throw it in a special bin, a waste bin, so they can inventory it.
[00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:53.380]   So one of the things a closer has to do at the end of the day is count.
[00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:54.380]   Paddies.
[00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:56.940]   The paddies count how much was wasted so that they can, you know, they're inventory
[00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:57.940]   all of totals up.
[00:21:57.940 --> 00:22:00.500]   At one point, you know, we felt like this is a waste to throw this stuff away.
[00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:02.180]   Went to the dog pound.
[00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:04.980]   And we said, can we give you our waste bin?
[00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:07.340]   And they said, no, that it's not good for the dogs.
[00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:08.340]   It's not enough protein.
[00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:10.140]   It wouldn't take it.
[00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:11.780]   It's not sad.
[00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:14.060]   Dogs won't eat it.
[00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:15.060]   Dogs won't eat it.
[00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:16.060]   Sorry.
[00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:17.340]   There's not enough food value.
[00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:20.500]   Oh my speaking of bad patents.
[00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:22.420]   LSI got a patent patent number.
[00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:26.740]   This is awarded 702-8023.
[00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:30.220]   It's a patent for ladies and gentlemen linked lists.
[00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:32.780]   Now if you happen to know anything about programming, you know that since the earliest
[00:22:32.780 --> 00:22:35.900]   days of programming, link lists have been kind of a fundamental feature.
[00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:38.820]   It's like patenting a sort.
[00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:40.260]   I don't know how they got this patent.
[00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:41.260]   It was on a sort.
[00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:44.140]   Who is the one again that got the who was the company?
[00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:45.140]   LSI.
[00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:46.140]   Yeah, LSI.
[00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:47.140]   Is this a semiconductor company?
[00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:48.140]   Yeah.
[00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:52.900]   It's a patent on a, according to slash dot, a stunning new technique and data structures,
[00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:55.100]   the concept of a linked list.
[00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:56.100]   Wow.
[00:22:56.100 --> 00:23:01.020]   I mean, this just shows you why software patents and sandwich patents.
[00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:02.940]   Not a good idea.
[00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:07.220]   So how about, as you might have seen these DMCA exemptions that were granted by the Library
[00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:08.220]   of Congress?
[00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:09.220]   Good news.
[00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:10.220]   Well, next news.
[00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:12.020]   Good news because they grow any exemptions.
[00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:13.620]   They never grant exceptions, right?
[00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:17.860]   Well, this, yeah, it's kind of interesting the timing on this one, but it's, it's, do
[00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:21.220]   the two, I think the two that'll be closest to the hearts of our audience are computer
[00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:25.660]   programs and video games distributed in formats that have become obsolete and that require
[00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:28.580]   the original media or hardware as a condition of access.
[00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:30.980]   So that means it's okay to copy ROMs.
[00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:32.460]   That's what it sounds like.
[00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:34.700]   A format shall hold on.
[00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:39.380]   A format shall be considered obsolete if the machine or system necessary to render perceptible
[00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:43.860]   at work stored in that format is no longer manufactured or is no longer reasonably available
[00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:45.340]   in the commercial marketplace.
[00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:46.340]   That's good.
[00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:48.620]   Yeah, it's a thin loophole, but it's a loophole.
[00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:50.540]   Well, no, it depends on what you're talking about.
[00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:53.700]   If there's no Coleco vision machine anymore, you can copy it.
[00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:54.900]   If there's an emulator, right?
[00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:58.660]   Well, the question is, is, does reasonably available in the commercial marketplace mean
[00:23:58.660 --> 00:24:02.100]   if you pay for for sale on eBay, you know, for 20 grand?
[00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:03.820]   Does that constitute reasonably available?
[00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:07.860]   I think the library is, yeah, I think the library actually was surprisingly lean.
[00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:11.820]   I mean, there's one thing that he does not grant an exception that is not going to make
[00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:12.820]   people happy.
[00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:13.820]   You mean backing up your DVDs?
[00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:14.820]   Yeah.
[00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:15.820]   Yeah.
[00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:19.220]   If you're a film professor, you can, you can hack it and take flips for your students
[00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:20.660]   now, which you couldn't do before.
[00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:21.820]   So that's one nice thing.
[00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:22.820]   Yeah.
[00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:23.820]   But you cannot copy it to an iPod.
[00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:26.660]   No, copy or sell pod.
[00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:28.860]   That would be a violation of copyright law.
[00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:29.860]   Right.
[00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:30.860]   Is it to find film professor though?
[00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:34.780]   Because I can see a lot of 17-year-olds starting up film classes for their mates.
[00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:35.780]   I've got a film club.
[00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:40.480]   The educational library of a college or university's film or media studies department where
[00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:43.860]   circumvention is accomplished for the purpose of making compilations of portions of those
[00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:48.660]   work for educational use in the classroom, by media studies or film professors.
[00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:49.660]   It's pretty well defined.
[00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:53.220]   We should say that the university involved down the street.
[00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:57.700]   The reason that these exemptions are required is because these are, would be technically
[00:24:57.700 --> 00:25:00.340]   violations of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.
[00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:04.700]   But the librarian of Congress, what has jurisdiction over how it's enforced?
[00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:08.540]   They can basically make selective, they can sort of selectively interpret fair use in some
[00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:15.580]   cases or basically create holes in the DMCA or other things that impact copyright law.
[00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:19.300]   As I understand it from reading the stories, this is rare that you will see these kinds
[00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:20.300]   of exemptions.
[00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:27.100]   The librarian of Congress, James Billington, allowed six exemptions where often none are
[00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:28.100]   allowed.
[00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:29.100]   Yeah.
[00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:31.100]   It's like the dongle exemption.
[00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:32.100]   Yeah, that was the idea.
[00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:33.100]   I love that.
[00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:34.100]   I love that.
[00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:35.100]   I love that.
[00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:36.100]   I love that.
[00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:37.100]   I love that.
[00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:38.100]   I love that.
[00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:39.100]   I love that.
[00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:40.100]   I love that.
[00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:41.100]   I love that.
[00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:44.600]   The other one is the literary works distributed in the e-book format when all existing e-book
[00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:46.140]   editions of the work contain access controls.
[00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:47.140]   It's just funny to read some.
[00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:47.140]   Well, and if you have a dongle and you can't use the software and the dongle is broken and
[00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:49.100]   there's nobody to replace the dongle, you can reverse engineer the dongle or the
[00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:50.100]   software.
[00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:51.100]   I think that's great.
[00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:52.100]   Yeah, that's a good reason.
[00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:56.780]   I think there's an interesting caveat on the abandoned work point for gamers, which is
[00:25:56.780 --> 00:26:00.420]   that you're only allowed to crack the games and doesn't actually give you license to
[00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:02.420]   distribute the abandoned work games.
[00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:05.860]   It just means you can get the games if you already own the game in the first place.
[00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:09.900]   Well, no, that's actually kind of what some people have felt the existing interpretation
[00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:14.380]   was that you were allowed to download the ROM if you already owned a copy.
[00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:17.780]   Like, you know, if you happen to have the IC sitting around the original e-prom programming
[00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:18.780]   on it for it.
[00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:22.660]   I mean, this is a little, yeah, I mean, yeah, in theory, you can't distribute it.
[00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:23.660]   I don't know.
[00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:26.860]   It'll be interesting to see what people do with this, you know.
[00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:32.460]   I just think it's this is according to the news stories, the most exemptions ever granted
[00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:37.660]   at one time and for the first time ever groups of users have been exempted.
[00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:38.660]   So that's.
[00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:43.020]   Yeah, you know, but the basic reason for this is because the copyright laws right now are
[00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:44.020]   so screwed up.
[00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:45.020]   That's right.
[00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:47.020]   I think that's exactly right.
[00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:50.700]   In fact, if you read between the lines and when Billington's talking, he's saying, well,
[00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:51.700]   you know, come on.
[00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:53.620]   He's basically saying, come on, you got to exempt this.
[00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:57.340]   Well, public domains effectively dead right now, you know, at least for another, what,
[00:26:57.340 --> 00:26:58.340]   83 years?
[00:26:58.340 --> 00:26:59.340]   Is there appeal?
[00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:02.100]   Can the motion picture association or I guess they wouldn't appeal?
[00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:03.260]   Maybe the game association.
[00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:04.260]   Can they go to?
[00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:05.260]   Why would they?
[00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:06.260]   Oh, yeah.
[00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:07.260]   That's the point.
[00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:09.260]   Nobody wants this stuff anyway.
[00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:15.300]   I mean, the big thing to me that I think we really is disconcerting is there's a lot
[00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:22.300]   of stuff that is borderline public domain and nobody knows the promise nobody knows who
[00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:23.300]   nobody knows who owns it.
[00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:28.380]   If you wanted to license things from some period in the thirties, for example, and you
[00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:32.780]   find an old book and there's something you need to use, you can't find the owner.
[00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:33.780]   It's just almost impossible.
[00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:37.380]   It's published by some weird company that you know, that was bought up by a company who
[00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:41.020]   bought another company, but you'd have to be a detective or just try to figure out who
[00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:42.020]   owns it.
[00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:43.380]   And then you still don't know if it would be rights were sold.
[00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:47.540]   I mean, there are so many rights in limbo right now that it's ridiculous.
[00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:52.740]   Yeah, we're living in the 1600s of intellectual property law.
[00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:55.180]   It's just ridiculous.
[00:27:55.180 --> 00:28:00.780]   It's so similar to market realism, the restrictions that people want to put because they're just
[00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:02.180]   afraid of what's going to happen.
[00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:03.860]   They just have no idea what's going to happen.
[00:28:03.860 --> 00:28:07.740]   So they think they can keep every single sense that they're an intellectual property
[00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:08.740]   to get it.
[00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:11.500]   Well, now the French are suing Google print.
[00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:15.900]   Well, it's also interesting the IFPA, which is kind of the international version of the
[00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:20.420]   RIAA, one of their reps also said in the interview last week that DRM has essentially
[00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:22.420]   failed and good that there may be a--
[00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:23.860]   I got the proof of that.
[00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:26.020]   There's a Zoom.
[00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:27.020]   That's example one.
[00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:28.740]   I think this is the beginning of the end.
[00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:31.260]   This Zoom, you're going to look at it and say, boy, that was when people started to realize
[00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:32.260]   DRM is a terrible idea.
[00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:36.140]   Well, except that's very locked down by DRM and that's what I'm saying.
[00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:40.460]   This is finally pushed it so far that it's not going to sell and people are going to say,
[00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:44.740]   you know, there may be a downside to DRM from the point of view of manufacturing.
[00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:48.860]   Is that a downside to DRM or a downside to marketing because the IPod is fairly heavily
[00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:50.500]   locked down by DRM but it's obviously--
[00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:53.100]   Does it feel quite as encumbered?
[00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:54.100]   Does it--
[00:28:54.100 --> 00:29:01.140]   Yeah, well, I think the real issue with the Zoom which is bordering on the disgusting
[00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:05.980]   is the fact that if you had-- say you created your own song and you wanted to share it with
[00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:10.100]   your friends and you were running it off the Zoom, it's going to put copy protection on
[00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:12.300]   the song whether you want it to or not.
[00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:14.020]   Now there's a new hack.
[00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:18.340]   If you heard of the hack, there's a hard drive hack that allows you to make the Zoom a USB
[00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:19.340]   storage device.
[00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:23.860]   You can change everything to a .jpg and a real .jpg transfer those and you'll be good.
[00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:25.660]   But crazy, that's a hack.
[00:29:25.660 --> 00:29:28.620]   But John, the thing is that that's a firmware fixed, right?
[00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:29.620]   They hammered this thing out.
[00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:34.860]   It'll be really interesting to see what they do in terms of improving the user experience
[00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:35.860]   in firmware upgrades.
[00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:36.860]   I'll tell you where there's a problem already.
[00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:38.340]   It's a nice clean piece of hardware.
[00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:39.540]   Oh, I love the hardware.
[00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:41.660]   I'll tell you where there's a problem.
[00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:46.620]   More to the point, if you had purchased a thousand songs from Microsoft's own music
[00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:50.980]   store and you've got those on your hard drive and you buy a Zoom and you say, "Wait a minute,
[00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:55.820]   you're saying I can't play those on my Zoom and I can't get a copy for the Zoom.
[00:29:55.820 --> 00:29:57.740]   I have to buy them all over again."
[00:29:57.740 --> 00:29:58.740]   That's asinine.
[00:29:58.740 --> 00:30:01.780]   That's part of the level I can't even-- I don't understand it.
[00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:06.100]   It's almost like Microsoft wants to instruct people how bad VRF is.
[00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:07.100]   Well, that's exactly it.
[00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:11.940]   But then they're instructing the rest of us how we are all pirates by paying universal
[00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:15.940]   a license fee because everybody who owns a Zoom clearly is stealing songs and playing.
[00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:18.420]   Was that an I-Steal Allow universal music for?
[00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:19.420]   Well, maybe--
[00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:20.420]   By the Zoom.
[00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:21.420]   Wouldn't that be an interesting court case?
[00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:25.060]   Do you now have a right to steal universal music?
[00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:26.060]   Interesting thought.
[00:30:26.060 --> 00:30:28.020]   Wouldn't that be a great turn about as fair play?
[00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:31.180]   Now, I have to tell you, I have a Zoom full of music.
[00:30:31.180 --> 00:30:33.100]   It's every bit of it's paid for.
[00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:34.100]   There's no pirated music.
[00:30:34.100 --> 00:30:36.100]   Do I get a rebate from universal?
[00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:37.100]   I wanna--
[00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:40.100]   Yeah, send the president a memo.
[00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:41.100]   Send the bill.
[00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:44.100]   Send your check the next day.
[00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:48.100]   Why don't we all just drop in on Nancy Pelosi's office?
[00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:49.100]   Yeah.
[00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:50.100]   Hey, Nancy.
[00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:51.100]   This is a Zoom.
[00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:52.100]   I do love the user interface.
[00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:53.100]   I love how it looks.
[00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:54.100]   I love how it feels.
[00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:55.100]   There's a lot to be said about the Zoom.
[00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:56.100]   You know, it's great.
[00:30:56.100 --> 00:31:00.700]   I've been playing with the new Xbox Live Marketplace.
[00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:03.100]   You can buy TV and rent videos.
[00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:05.100]   Does it work for you?
[00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:06.100]   Yeah, it works for you.
[00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:07.100]   Now, here are some glitches the first day.
[00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:11.100]   The downloads are a little slow, but I downloaded all of Studio 60.
[00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:13.100]   It's 480p, but it looks great on my HDTV.
[00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:15.500]   I haven't done a movie yet, because you know why?
[00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:18.100]   The HD movie's five or six gigabytes.
[00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:19.100]   Yeah, let's say--
[00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:20.100]   --the same as separate drive.
[00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:21.100]   That's--
[00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:22.100]   Yeah, because I have a 20 gig drive.
[00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:23.100]   And there is no separate drive.
[00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:25.100]   And there's another 20 gig drive.
[00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:26.100]   Did you--
[00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:27.100]   Wait, maybe--
[00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:29.100]   Leo, did you download a Studio 60, the TV show?
[00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:30.100]   Yeah, I love it.
[00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:31.100]   Yeah, it's a good show.
[00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:33.100]   Did you have to pay for it?
[00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:34.100]   Buck99.
[00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:36.700]   She just recorded on the TV for God's sake.
[00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:38.100]   I don't have cable.
[00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:39.100]   No.
[00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:40.100]   And I could--
[00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:45.540]   You know from where you are, I'll bet you if you put a fringe antenna on your little
[00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:46.540]   roof.
[00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:47.540]   No, I can't get it.
[00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:48.540]   And you could probably pull it right off the--
[00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:49.540]   --too far north I can't get it.
[00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:50.540]   And she's down at San Jose.
[00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:51.540]   It's at San Jose.
[00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:52.540]   I'm up in Petaluma.
[00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:53.540]   I can't get it.
[00:31:53.540 --> 00:31:55.540]   No, no, they have their repeater up here now, as far as I know.
[00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:56.540]   Really?
[00:31:56.540 --> 00:31:57.540]   Well, I still can't get it.
[00:31:57.540 --> 00:31:58.540]   I can't get any--
[00:31:58.540 --> 00:31:59.540]   No, San Jose, you can't.
[00:31:59.540 --> 00:32:00.540]   I can't get any--
[00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:01.540]   You know what Channel 50 has be, which three runs?
[00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:02.540]   I can--
[00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:05.460]   No, that's I pretty muchini.
[00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:06.460]   Sorry.
[00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:10.500]   That's the difference between bump, bumping and diggly, diggly.
[00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:11.500]   That's the one.
[00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:12.500]   Yeah, very important.
[00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:15.060]   You distinguish those two magical tricks.
[00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:18.540]   But Leo, that works.
[00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:20.140]   I downloaded them on BitTorrent.
[00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:21.140]   I have the shows.
[00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:23.300]   But you know on the dish network you should--
[00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:27.300]   I don't want to pay-- you don't understand.
[00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:28.300]   I don't want to pay for cable.
[00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:29.460]   I don't want to pay for a dish.
[00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:30.980]   I want to buy a la carte.
[00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:33.420]   I want just the shows I want with no commercials.
[00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:34.180]   And I love this.
[00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:37.060]   And I bought an Xbox 360 for the HDTV.
[00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:40.060]   And by the way, Gears of War.
[00:32:40.060 --> 00:32:40.980]   Unbelievable.
[00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:44.980]   The HD graphics on there, incredible.
[00:32:44.980 --> 00:32:47.180]   And now that I can put TV shows on it, I'm liking it.
[00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:47.980]   I wish it was a bigger--
[00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:49.140]   Yeah, I understand what you're saying.
[00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:51.100]   But I'm trying to add it up here.
[00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:53.260]   I mean, it's $8 a month right there off the top.
[00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:54.180]   For studio 60.
[00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:56.180]   Yeah, but I don't watch that much TV.
[00:32:56.180 --> 00:32:57.900]   Well, you're watching $8 worth right there.
[00:32:57.900 --> 00:32:59.060]   You know what my cable bill was?
[00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:00.100]   You know what my cable bill was?
[00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:01.740]   My cable bill's over $100.
[00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:03.220]   Yeah, no, but $70.
[00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:04.420]   Over $100.
[00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:07.940]   And how much do you pay to go to a movie, John?
[00:33:07.940 --> 00:33:09.820]   I mean, $2 for a TV show.
[00:33:09.820 --> 00:33:12.100]   A good TV show like that, as it is fair.
[00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:15.500]   I pay for Despern Housewives, The Office.
[00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:15.940]   That--
[00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:16.940]   You get a commercial free?
[00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:18.060]   Commercial free.
[00:33:18.060 --> 00:33:19.100]   Oh, that's $480.
[00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:20.380]   Wait, you don't pay for it.
[00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:21.380]   You get to watch commercials.
[00:33:21.380 --> 00:33:23.140]   That's what you stream online with a commercial.
[00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:24.980]   Yeah, I don't want to watch commercials.
[00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:26.700]   And I don't want my-- more to the point,
[00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:28.220]   I don't want my kids to see their commercials.
[00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:30.780]   My son, this is weird, 12-year-old,
[00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:32.220]   is really into Despern Housewives.
[00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:33.420]   Should I be concerned?
[00:33:33.420 --> 00:33:36.660]   Yes, I would get counseling for the boy.
[00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:37.620]   He really loves it.
[00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:39.300]   He's perfectly normal to make.
[00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:39.940]   God, it's weird.
[00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:40.820]   I don't know.
[00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:41.300]   Really?
[00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:42.340]   Why would you buy the--
[00:33:42.340 --> 00:33:46.380]   Why would you buy the TV and stand at there?
[00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:48.420]   I didn't know I have an HDTV.
[00:33:48.420 --> 00:33:49.540]   Oh, you can't buy the TV--
[00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:50.340]   You said download it.
[00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:52.340]   They don't have HD versions of the show, but they have--
[00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:52.700]   Oh, what?
[00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:53.660]   So it's like the whole--
[00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:54.220]   Wait a minute.
[00:33:54.220 --> 00:33:55.020]   It's 360 HD.
[00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:56.700]   And you can't download it in HD.
[00:33:56.700 --> 00:33:59.860]   I got to tell you, the 480p on my HDTV looks great.
[00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:00.940]   It looks fine.
[00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:02.420]   Part of that will, I think, has--
[00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:03.780]   But you're right, this should offer HD.
[00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:06.740]   But a lot of that has to do with just the horrendous file
[00:34:06.740 --> 00:34:07.980]   sizes for HD.
[00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:08.460]   Yeah.
[00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:11.700]   You get broadcast quality HD compression, just a big honking
[00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:12.220]   file.
[00:34:12.220 --> 00:34:15.820]   About 500 megabytes for 44 minutes of television.
[00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:16.900]   And that's in standard.
[00:34:16.900 --> 00:34:18.020]   That's standard F.
[00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:20.100]   Actually, the Hans is not standard F, it's in Hans F.
[00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:21.740]   It's ED, 480, 480p.
[00:34:21.740 --> 00:34:23.620]   Which is essentially standard F.
[00:34:23.620 --> 00:34:24.620]   It looks-- you know what, though?
[00:34:24.620 --> 00:34:26.060]   It looks fine on my--
[00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:29.300]   You get it 16 by 9 standard F?
[00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:30.340]   Yes, it is.
[00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:31.420]   It's widescreen.
[00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:32.460]   Oh, that's nice.
[00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:34.180]   But it's bars, top and bottom, or--
[00:34:34.180 --> 00:34:35.020]   Little bars.
[00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:35.980]   No, no bars.
[00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:36.660]   No bars.
[00:34:36.660 --> 00:34:40.980]   No, on my aqueos, which is a 16 by 9 TV, no, it fills the screen.
[00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:42.660]   Right, because it's probably shot in HD.
[00:34:42.660 --> 00:34:44.260]   It's shot in 16 9.
[00:34:44.260 --> 00:34:48.940]   So really, 480p in a 16 by 9 is actually pretty good resolution.
[00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:50.700]   OK, enough of that.
[00:34:50.700 --> 00:34:51.460]   I would--
[00:34:51.460 --> 00:34:51.980]   I would-- the sharpest thing.
[00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:53.700]   I think, though, it's really interesting that Microsoft
[00:34:53.700 --> 00:34:57.260]   has entered this, and I have to say, if you are already an Xbox
[00:34:57.260 --> 00:35:01.980]   360 user and you've got Xbox Live, this is not a bad.
[00:35:01.980 --> 00:35:04.220]   This is a pretty compelling combination
[00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:06.700]   compared to what Apple's got, which is only on a computer
[00:35:06.700 --> 00:35:07.460]   at this point.
[00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:08.020]   Right.
[00:35:08.020 --> 00:35:10.460]   Now, this is-- my Xbox has already hooked up to my TV,
[00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:12.100]   so it's a very natural place to put stuff.
[00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:14.140]   This needs larger hard drives for this stuff.
[00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:16.060]   Well, I got to think that Microsoft
[00:35:16.060 --> 00:35:18.220]   is going to wait until everybody buys a 360.
[00:35:18.220 --> 00:35:20.900]   And then, January 1, they're going to announce an 80 gig
[00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:22.340]   snap on hard drive, don't you think?
[00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:24.540]   Yeah, that was a cool thing about the Xbox 360
[00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:26.100]   is that the hard drive comes off of that.
[00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:26.460]   Right.
[00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:28.940]   And don't you think that they're going to wait till after everybody
[00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:29.540]   buys--
[00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:30.620]   I'd like to know where the third--
[00:35:30.620 --> 00:35:31.980]   By the extra 20 gig, you're--
[00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:32.500]   Exactly.
[00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:33.500]   --about with an 80 gig.
[00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:34.420]   Exactly.
[00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:35.980]   Yep.
[00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:37.900]   It's a profit thing.
[00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:38.620]   Ting.
[00:35:38.620 --> 00:35:39.980]   It's a profit thing.
[00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:41.900]   Still in the page from Apple, but--
[00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:44.660]   The study-- I don't know if Apple-- would Apple do that?
[00:35:44.660 --> 00:35:46.460]   That's pretty hardcore.
[00:35:46.460 --> 00:35:47.620]   On the other hand, I'm-- you know, I'm
[00:35:47.620 --> 00:35:49.820]   funny because I'm sitting here and I'm actually liking it
[00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:52.220]   because there's not very many shows on here.
[00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:54.220]   And the movie selection is bizarre.
[00:35:54.220 --> 00:35:55.780]   You know, like "Cherry, It's a Fire."
[00:35:55.780 --> 00:35:56.700]   No, so that's it.
[00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:58.980]   Not moving right along.
[00:35:58.980 --> 00:36:02.860]   Does anybody have any thoughts on where this thing is headed
[00:36:02.860 --> 00:36:05.580]   with the Microsoft OpenSUSE developers?
[00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:08.740]   Do you hear the latest, which is Mark Shuttleworth,
[00:36:08.740 --> 00:36:14.660]   the Ubuntu guy, is tried to poach on the OpenSUSE--
[00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:17.500]   You know, OpenSUSE is a kind of the free version of SUSE
[00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:19.500]   in the "Novel's Linux."
[00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:21.740]   Trying to poach developers from the OpenSUSE project.
[00:36:21.740 --> 00:36:26.780]   It was so embarrassing that members of the Ubuntu team,
[00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:30.060]   Corey Berger, to be specific, wrote to the mailing list,
[00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:34.020]   apologizing for Shuttleworth, saying it was ill-advised
[00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:36.500]   and commenting that what Mark did is simply not done.
[00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:38.060]   There's no need for OpenSUSE projects
[00:36:38.060 --> 00:36:40.380]   to poach developers and users from each other,
[00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:41.300]   especially this manner.
[00:36:41.300 --> 00:36:45.460]   Mark Shuttleworth looking kind of like the RVs to Nuvo Riche.
[00:36:45.460 --> 00:36:50.140]   Well, it's a Jason Calicanis move, basically.
[00:36:50.140 --> 00:36:52.220]   Except for that, the success and the--
[00:36:52.220 --> 00:36:53.500]   Yeah, with the other 23 million--
[00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:55.460]   Well, but Shuttleworth made a lot in the--
[00:36:55.460 --> 00:36:57.660]   .com boom.
[00:36:57.660 --> 00:36:58.500]   Back in the days.
[00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:01.820]   And he's funding Ubuntu, which is great.
[00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:05.500]   My favorite was the parody response to the Ubuntu list
[00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:08.500]   where they asked the Ubuntu developers to come open to OpenSUSE
[00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:10.940]   because they're using those proprietary binaries now
[00:37:10.940 --> 00:37:11.540]   in Ubuntu.
[00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:13.740]   So you know that you'll probably upset them
[00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:15.660]   when it comes open to OpenSUSE.
[00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:17.700]   Are they using proprietary binaries in Ubuntu?
[00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:18.940]   I don't know if it's even true of it.
[00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:20.820]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:22.060]   So come back.
[00:37:22.060 --> 00:37:24.540]   Come back.
[00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:27.380]   But he does raise the point that if you're a developer for SUSE,
[00:37:27.380 --> 00:37:29.100]   you must kind of get a queasy feeling
[00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:30.620]   when you see this novell Microsoft deal.
[00:37:30.620 --> 00:37:32.580]   We talked about it at length last week.
[00:37:32.580 --> 00:37:33.820]   Well, I think this is the whole idea.
[00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:38.300]   Is novell trying to step around their obligations to the GPL?
[00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:38.900]   Yes.
[00:37:38.900 --> 00:37:40.620]   OK.
[00:37:40.620 --> 00:37:42.180]   Well, they're violating the GPL.
[00:37:42.180 --> 00:37:43.860]   Again, we've got to get even Mogulon on.
[00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:45.660]   We're going to do a floss weekly with Eben again.
[00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:46.940]   We had him on a couple of weeks ago.
[00:37:46.940 --> 00:37:49.660]   He's a great lawyer for the Free Software Foundation
[00:37:49.660 --> 00:37:52.420]   who basically designed the GPLs, working on GPL3.
[00:37:52.420 --> 00:37:53.420]   We asked him--
[00:37:53.420 --> 00:37:55.340]   Chris DiMona asked him a couple of weeks ago,
[00:37:55.340 --> 00:37:58.060]   and Eben, who is a very measured, thoughtful guy,
[00:37:58.060 --> 00:38:01.140]   said, I really want to study this and think about
[00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:02.340]   before I make a response.
[00:38:02.340 --> 00:38:04.220]   Because when I speak, in effect,
[00:38:04.220 --> 00:38:06.900]   is speaking for the Free Software Foundation.
[00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:09.620]   But as soon as Eben has something to say,
[00:38:09.620 --> 00:38:10.980]   we'll get him on.
[00:38:10.980 --> 00:38:11.700]   It's complicated.
[00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:12.700]   That's one of the reasons we--
[00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:15.140]   My understanding is that GPL3 is just
[00:38:15.140 --> 00:38:17.780]   a hit at brick wall because of stallman.
[00:38:17.780 --> 00:38:20.980]   Well, there's always politics with this stuff.
[00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:22.740]   There's issues with GPL3.
[00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:26.100]   What's wrong with GPL2?
[00:38:26.100 --> 00:38:27.540]   Guys, I like stallman.
[00:38:27.540 --> 00:38:30.380]   I can't remember what the deal is, why they're going to 3.
[00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:31.220]   Nobody knows.
[00:38:31.220 --> 00:38:33.540]   No, if you really want to hear the details,
[00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:35.260]   there's a very, very good discussion of it
[00:38:35.260 --> 00:38:38.500]   on floss weekly with Eben.
[00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:39.420]   I'm sorry.
[00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:42.220]   I'm just kidding to stuck at stallman and brick wall
[00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:45.460]   being kind of redundant.
[00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:50.140]   Walmart.com, this is a biggie on Black Friday,
[00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:54.820]   down for 10 hours from 4.30 AM Eastern time, which
[00:38:54.820 --> 00:38:56.140]   makes me wonder why they're down.
[00:38:56.140 --> 00:39:00.100]   Because is there any shopping going on at 4.30 AM Eastern?
[00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:01.300]   They went down at 4.
[00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:02.340]   There is?
[00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:04.620]   Yeah, all those people waiting in line with their Wi-Fi
[00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:05.140]   connection.
[00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:08.660]   There were people lying at 1.30 afternoon on Thursday
[00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:10.580]   in the East Coast to get into stores.
[00:39:10.580 --> 00:39:11.100]   Really?
[00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:13.260]   For the 5 AM sales on--
[00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:14.060]   See, I don't get it.
[00:39:14.060 --> 00:39:15.900]   I mean, Amazon had a little blip because remember,
[00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:18.620]   they sold at 11 o'clock, 11 in the morning on Thanksgiving
[00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:18.900]   day.
[00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:21.860]   They had 1,000 Xbox 360s for $100.
[00:39:21.860 --> 00:39:24.460]   By the way, they say they sold them out in 29 seconds.
[00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:24.860]   Yeah.
[00:39:24.860 --> 00:39:27.740]   The PS-- I mean, I feel bad for Sony right now,
[00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:29.340]   because they've sold everything out.
[00:39:29.340 --> 00:39:30.900]   They have no cheap Blu-ray player.
[00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:32.980]   Nobody's going to buy any screwed.
[00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:37.420]   What is the point of these sorts of sales?
[00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:38.260]   Well, God, are you kidding?
[00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:39.500]   It got a lot of attention to Amazon.
[00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:40.820]   A lot of people go to Amazon buy.
[00:39:40.820 --> 00:39:41.820]   I think it's a brilliant idea.
[00:39:41.820 --> 00:39:42.460]   So what they do--
[00:39:42.460 --> 00:39:44.580]   It was brilliant to lose money on every sale.
[00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:47.740]   No, they just don't know that there's only a thousand sales.
[00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:49.740]   There's only a thousand units.
[00:39:49.740 --> 00:39:52.420]   So here's-- this is the deal.
[00:39:52.420 --> 00:39:54.380]   I think it's inspired marketing.
[00:39:54.380 --> 00:39:55.060]   It's brilliant.
[00:39:55.060 --> 00:39:56.940]   So that's for the first time they--
[00:39:56.940 --> 00:39:58.580]   It was the worst side of people.
[00:39:58.580 --> 00:39:59.900]   How can this be inspired by it?
[00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:00.540]   It's only online.
[00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:03.260]   It's not like shooting each other in a Walmart parking lot.
[00:40:03.260 --> 00:40:05.380]   It identifies your brand with barbeques.
[00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:06.060]   It's brilliant.
[00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:06.700]   I think it's brilliant.
[00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:07.860]   They pick four items, right?
[00:40:07.860 --> 00:40:09.740]   Most of them silly.
[00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:12.620]   Cheap prime membership, a bicycle.
[00:40:12.620 --> 00:40:14.020]   I can't remember what the third one was.
[00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:16.420]   And oh, an Xbox 360 for $100.
[00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:18.180]   Now you vote, so they have a week of voting.
[00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:19.740]   People going to the Amazon site.
[00:40:19.740 --> 00:40:20.260]   Right.
[00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:22.420]   Hundreds of thousands, probably millions of people voting.
[00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:23.740]   Oh, make it the Xbox 360.
[00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:26.380]   Of course, they got 98% of the votes were Xbox 360.
[00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:29.020]   So they say 11 o'clock Thanksgiving morning, 11 o'clock
[00:40:29.020 --> 00:40:30.060]   Pacific.
[00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:32.100]   We're going to sell 1,000 units.
[00:40:32.100 --> 00:40:34.460]   Once they're gone, they're gone for $100.
[00:40:34.460 --> 00:40:36.220]   29 seconds later, they're all sold.
[00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:37.220]   But guess what?
[00:40:37.220 --> 00:40:38.860]   They drive tons of traffic.
[00:40:38.860 --> 00:40:39.860]   They get lots of attention.
[00:40:39.860 --> 00:40:41.500]   They got people like us talking about it.
[00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:43.860]   And they're going to sell a lot of Xbox 360s at full price.
[00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:44.780]   I think I have to think.
[00:40:44.780 --> 00:40:46.900]   Stop talking about it.
[00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:48.380]   I think it's actually inspired.
[00:40:48.380 --> 00:40:51.260]   I think it's showing why Amazon is on top, frankly.
[00:40:51.260 --> 00:40:52.540]   I think this is very smart.
[00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:56.620]   Meanwhile, Walmart, who should be expecting a massive influx
[00:40:56.620 --> 00:40:59.900]   of traffic on Black Friday, is down for 10 hours.
[00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:01.620]   How much could that cost them?
[00:41:01.620 --> 00:41:02.780]   Millions.
[00:41:02.780 --> 00:41:04.740]   I think, John, it's one of these blackmail things
[00:41:04.740 --> 00:41:06.220]   that you've been talking about.
[00:41:06.220 --> 00:41:08.820]   These extortion schemes, where they go to a poker site,
[00:41:08.820 --> 00:41:14.020]   and they say, if you want to be up for the next 24 hours,
[00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:15.620]   you're going to need some support.
[00:41:15.620 --> 00:41:17.900]   And basically, these are gangsters
[00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:19.020]   saying, we're going to shut you down
[00:41:19.020 --> 00:41:20.620]   unless you give us protection money.
[00:41:20.620 --> 00:41:22.460]   I have to think that this is what happened to Walmart.
[00:41:22.460 --> 00:41:23.220]   Well, it's absolutely.
[00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:24.540]   I wouldn't be a bit surprised.
[00:41:24.540 --> 00:41:29.580]   I think they're all-- most of the really high-end crime
[00:41:29.580 --> 00:41:31.740]   being done by organized crime, the big boys.
[00:41:31.740 --> 00:41:32.340]   That's where the money is.
[00:41:32.340 --> 00:41:33.300]   These are all high-tech stuff.
[00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:34.300]   That's where the money is.
[00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:34.300]   I mean, it's--
[00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:36.020]   I'm going to pump and dump and all these other things that are--
[00:41:36.020 --> 00:41:37.380]   It's risk-free.
[00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:41.460]   You know, you find some hacker who has 100,000 unit bot net.
[00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:42.780]   Or 100,000 is nothing.
[00:41:42.780 --> 00:41:44.900]   Maybe he looks at the guy with a million.
[00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:47.540]   And you could bring down Walmart for 10 hours, no sweat.
[00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:49.100]   I don't think it's possible that Walmart didn't
[00:41:49.100 --> 00:41:51.020]   run itself down by--
[00:41:51.020 --> 00:41:51.860]   Well, that's--
[00:41:51.860 --> 00:41:53.220]   What a coincidence.
[00:41:53.220 --> 00:41:56.220]   Either they're dumb.
[00:41:56.220 --> 00:41:57.300]   I mean, come on.
[00:41:57.300 --> 00:41:59.220]   You say Walmart wouldn't have enough servers?
[00:41:59.220 --> 00:42:02.740]   Well, Walmart said Walmart smokeswoman Amy Kalella
[00:42:02.740 --> 00:42:05.780]   blamed a, quote, "higher than anticipated traffic surge."
[00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:06.300]   Unquote.
[00:42:06.300 --> 00:42:07.100]   Yeah, that's a lot.
[00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:11.020]   That's a lot easier than saying what we was--
[00:42:11.020 --> 00:42:13.580]   No, this is like those scams that used to take place
[00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:17.740]   where bank transfers would cost banks millions of dollars.
[00:42:17.740 --> 00:42:19.580]   They would never admit to the public
[00:42:19.580 --> 00:42:21.300]   that they lost all this money because it makes them
[00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:22.540]   look like idiots.
[00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:25.460]   It doesn't do anything for their stock price.
[00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:27.660]   It freaks out the shareholders.
[00:42:27.660 --> 00:42:29.260]   You can't say what really happened.
[00:42:29.260 --> 00:42:30.620]   I have to think it was a doss-up.
[00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:31.620]   Yeah, I know it's--
[00:42:31.620 --> 00:42:33.820]   I have to think that.
[00:42:33.820 --> 00:42:37.260]   According to Keynote, Amazon was slow.
[00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:39.540]   They said they stumbled only briefly on Thursday.
[00:42:39.540 --> 00:42:40.780]   That was the 1,000 Xbox.
[00:42:40.780 --> 00:42:42.860]   But after that, the website was fine.
[00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:45.540]   It was only about 15 minutes slow down.
[00:42:45.540 --> 00:42:48.500]   Walt Disney Company site Disney Shopping.com
[00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:50.300]   suffered brief outages on Friday.
[00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:52.980]   I still just find it fascinating that it would be
[00:42:52.980 --> 00:42:54.980]   interesting to see when they do that--
[00:42:54.980 --> 00:42:56.780]   some more in January where they start
[00:42:56.780 --> 00:42:58.900]   talking about the percentage of online sales,
[00:42:58.900 --> 00:43:00.140]   how much it grew over last year.
[00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:01.900]   It would be really interesting to see
[00:43:01.900 --> 00:43:04.540]   if online shopping in the holiday season
[00:43:04.540 --> 00:43:06.860]   has taken off even more this year.
[00:43:06.860 --> 00:43:07.660]   I just think that--
[00:43:07.660 --> 00:43:08.980]   Oh, I think it's bigger than ever, don't you?
[00:43:08.980 --> 00:43:09.480]   Yeah.
[00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:11.340]   I think it's supposed to be bigger than ever.
[00:43:11.340 --> 00:43:13.780]   Just because I was listening to some interviews
[00:43:13.780 --> 00:43:17.100]   to have the classic-- the people are like,
[00:43:17.100 --> 00:43:18.620]   well, I wasn't going to come into the store,
[00:43:18.620 --> 00:43:19.540]   but they had Yada.
[00:43:19.540 --> 00:43:21.700]   And other than that, I mean, that classic sort
[00:43:21.700 --> 00:43:23.340]   of radio fluff interview.
[00:43:23.340 --> 00:43:25.140]   And it would be a really interesting--
[00:43:25.140 --> 00:43:27.940]   if Black Friday moves away from the frenzy in the stores
[00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:30.020]   to a frenzy online, well, they used
[00:43:30.020 --> 00:43:31.740]   to call it Cyber Monday because people
[00:43:31.740 --> 00:43:33.580]   would wait until they got to work.
[00:43:33.580 --> 00:43:36.340]   So tomorrow, everybody go to work and use the broadband
[00:43:36.340 --> 00:43:37.660]   at work, but now it already has--
[00:43:37.660 --> 00:43:39.100]   That's a total myth.
[00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:40.860]   There was never a land rush on Monday.
[00:43:40.860 --> 00:43:41.580]   There wasn't?
[00:43:41.580 --> 00:43:43.700]   The peaks were always in December-- last year
[00:43:43.700 --> 00:43:45.180]   was December 18.
[00:43:45.180 --> 00:43:48.860]   I think the year before that was like the end of November--
[00:43:48.860 --> 00:43:50.340]   Yeah, who buys now, really?
[00:43:50.340 --> 00:43:51.900]   I mean, especially if you're buying online,
[00:43:51.900 --> 00:43:53.620]   couldn't you just buy tomorrow or next week?
[00:43:53.620 --> 00:43:55.340]   Thoughtful organized people with a plan list.
[00:43:55.340 --> 00:43:57.420]   Yeah, I had to be stuck on one number.
[00:43:57.420 --> 00:43:59.420]   You know, they bought back in July.
[00:43:59.420 --> 00:43:59.940]   That's right.
[00:43:59.940 --> 00:44:02.260]   My wife's already got his shopping done.
[00:44:02.260 --> 00:44:04.460]   You know, Black Friday is no longer the biggest shopping
[00:44:04.460 --> 00:44:04.620]   day.
[00:44:04.620 --> 00:44:05.820]   I mean, it's already been documented
[00:44:05.820 --> 00:44:07.380]   that it's become-- it's moved.
[00:44:07.380 --> 00:44:09.820]   It's changed to Saturday just before Christmas.
[00:44:09.820 --> 00:44:11.700]   That's the number one shopping day.
[00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:13.580]   Who wants to shop a month ahead of time?
[00:44:13.580 --> 00:44:15.140]   And I think that's because people were doing--
[00:44:15.140 --> 00:44:17.020]   and I think a lot of this has to do with the people
[00:44:17.020 --> 00:44:19.140]   who are doing a lot more online shopping.
[00:44:19.140 --> 00:44:20.860]   And then at the last minute, when they realized,
[00:44:20.860 --> 00:44:22.180]   you know, they need to get some stuff
[00:44:22.180 --> 00:44:23.900]   because they didn't get everything.
[00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:24.860]   They rush it out.
[00:44:24.860 --> 00:44:28.300]   You know, I think I love to shop at the last minute,
[00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:29.700]   like the day before Christmas.
[00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:30.980]   Because they put everything on sale.
[00:44:30.980 --> 00:44:32.220]   The people are crazy.
[00:44:32.220 --> 00:44:32.740]   Yeah.
[00:44:32.740 --> 00:44:33.780]   It's like New York City.
[00:44:33.780 --> 00:44:34.980]   You see the worst of humanity.
[00:44:34.980 --> 00:44:36.060]   Bring a handgun.
[00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:38.260]   Actually, sometimes you see the best of humanity.
[00:44:38.260 --> 00:44:38.620]   You do.
[00:44:38.620 --> 00:44:40.820]   Everybody just wants to move quickly and get home.
[00:44:40.820 --> 00:44:42.660]   You can have this tickle me Elmo Extreme.
[00:44:42.660 --> 00:44:43.860]   It's OK.
[00:44:43.860 --> 00:44:45.500]   I don't know about that.
[00:44:45.500 --> 00:44:47.140]   We had one on the cranky geek show,
[00:44:47.140 --> 00:44:49.260]   and it was very-- everyone got a kick out of it.
[00:44:49.260 --> 00:44:50.260]   It's funny.
[00:44:50.260 --> 00:44:52.700]   It can stand itself up.
[00:44:52.700 --> 00:44:55.660]   Which is hard for robots that robot like devices to do.
[00:44:55.660 --> 00:44:57.620]   Hey, sometimes it's hard for me to do.
[00:44:57.620 --> 00:44:58.500]   Well, it's--
[00:44:58.500 --> 00:45:00.500]   My 50th birthday this week, you know.
[00:45:00.500 --> 00:45:00.940]   Sony--
[00:45:00.940 --> 00:45:01.500]   Congratulations.
[00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:02.340]   Thank you.
[00:45:02.340 --> 00:45:04.260]   30th year in broadcasting as well.
[00:45:04.260 --> 00:45:07.220]   Sony admits now, or maybe they don't admit it.
[00:45:07.220 --> 00:45:08.980]   It's actually not according to Sony.
[00:45:08.980 --> 00:45:12.180]   It's according to American technology research.
[00:45:12.180 --> 00:45:17.940]   Sony only had 125,000 to 175,000 PS3s.
[00:45:17.940 --> 00:45:20.740]   They had planned 400,000 in a million units
[00:45:20.740 --> 00:45:21.500]   before the end of the year.
[00:45:21.500 --> 00:45:23.380]   They couldn't even come close, less than half.
[00:45:23.380 --> 00:45:24.460]   I've been reading it.
[00:45:24.460 --> 00:45:27.860]   I actually was talking to somebody who works indirectly with Sony.
[00:45:27.860 --> 00:45:32.340]   They were just pissed because they expected 400,000
[00:45:32.340 --> 00:45:34.900]   on launch day million by end of the year.
[00:45:34.900 --> 00:45:37.460]   Is it a supply chain issue?
[00:45:37.460 --> 00:45:39.100]   I would assume it's a supply chain.
[00:45:39.100 --> 00:45:39.500]   Yeah.
[00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:40.580]   It's the what?
[00:45:40.580 --> 00:45:42.380]   The blue ray diodes.
[00:45:42.380 --> 00:45:43.420]   Blue ray diodes.
[00:45:43.420 --> 00:45:44.340]   Is it the chip?
[00:45:44.340 --> 00:45:45.820]   Is it some combination of it?
[00:45:45.820 --> 00:45:48.660]   Yeah, I think it's a brilliant marketing ploy.
[00:45:48.660 --> 00:45:49.220]   I don't know.
[00:45:49.220 --> 00:45:50.620]   I don't think it's brilliant.
[00:45:50.620 --> 00:45:51.620]   No.
[00:45:51.620 --> 00:45:54.820]   Leave everything that is brilliant.
[00:45:54.820 --> 00:45:56.620]   Everything's a brilliant marketing ploy.
[00:45:56.620 --> 00:45:59.420]   If you think about it, the Michael Richards is going to be huge.
[00:45:59.420 --> 00:46:02.060]   I mean, the closest-- I mean, think like, OK, the weave,
[00:46:02.060 --> 00:46:04.020]   they ship their initial units, they sell out,
[00:46:04.020 --> 00:46:05.220]   they build anticipation.
[00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:07.460]   And oh, by the way, everybody's responding.
[00:46:07.460 --> 00:46:09.620]   I don't know anybody who's picked up a weave who hasn't been
[00:46:09.620 --> 00:46:10.340]   all kinds of enthusiastic.
[00:46:10.340 --> 00:46:11.340]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:46:11.340 --> 00:46:14.540]   The worst thing I've heard is like, well, I'm not all--
[00:46:14.540 --> 00:46:15.460]   I can't even use them.
[00:46:15.460 --> 00:46:16.500]   I hurt my elbow.
[00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:16.860]   Yeah.
[00:46:16.860 --> 00:46:17.780]   Somebody hurt their elbow.
[00:46:17.780 --> 00:46:21.780]   Or somebody's like, I really wish it had Xbox 360 or PS3
[00:46:21.780 --> 00:46:22.380]   graphics only.
[00:46:22.380 --> 00:46:24.660]   They said it in the graphic male geek way that's not really--
[00:46:24.660 --> 00:46:25.780]   Well, Brit.
[00:46:25.780 --> 00:46:29.700]   But I spent like an hour with a PS3, and all I could say,
[00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:32.420]   like, wow, well, it's a really good Blu-ray player.
[00:46:32.420 --> 00:46:33.940]   And boy, I can't wait until there's a--
[00:46:33.940 --> 00:46:36.900]   I can't wait until like, Motorstone is available for download,
[00:46:36.900 --> 00:46:39.020]   so I can maybe have a game that I can actually enjoy.
[00:46:39.020 --> 00:46:39.500]   It's a little curious.
[00:46:39.500 --> 00:46:41.140]   You bought an HD DVD player.
[00:46:41.140 --> 00:46:45.980]   I'm picking up actually the HD DVD Drive, the Xbox HD DVD Drive,
[00:46:45.980 --> 00:46:46.140]   which I--
[00:46:46.140 --> 00:46:46.860]   I bought one too.
[00:46:46.860 --> 00:46:50.700]   --converting into a $200 extension HD DVD extension
[00:46:50.700 --> 00:46:52.460]   for my home theater system.
[00:46:52.460 --> 00:46:54.340]   Oh, so this is a hack you're going to do on DLTV?
[00:46:54.340 --> 00:46:54.980]   Cool.
[00:46:54.980 --> 00:46:55.500]   Very cool.
[00:46:55.500 --> 00:46:58.380]   I'll stop the place next to your main match.
[00:46:58.380 --> 00:46:58.740]   Oh, yeah?
[00:46:58.740 --> 00:47:00.300]   You think Blu-rays the winner?
[00:47:00.300 --> 00:47:01.220]   I think they're both in.
[00:47:01.220 --> 00:47:01.940]   It's going to die.
[00:47:01.940 --> 00:47:02.460]   That's what I've--
[00:47:02.460 --> 00:47:03.980]   They're probably both going to die,
[00:47:03.980 --> 00:47:06.300]   but there's enough-- having seen some of really--
[00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:07.140]   They look good.
[00:47:07.140 --> 00:47:08.980]   Like, looking at good fellows in HD DVD is just--
[00:47:08.980 --> 00:47:09.700]   Oh, I bought it.
[00:47:09.700 --> 00:47:10.180]   I can't one.
[00:47:10.180 --> 00:47:11.260]   --speakably good.
[00:47:11.260 --> 00:47:11.820]   They're some really good--
[00:47:11.820 --> 00:47:13.220]   They're more going to die.
[00:47:13.220 --> 00:47:13.700]   They are because--
[00:47:13.700 --> 00:47:14.860]   It's going to take the place.
[00:47:14.860 --> 00:47:15.700]   The Xbox-- look it.
[00:47:15.700 --> 00:47:18.740]   You can download HD on content, and Xbox are ready.
[00:47:18.740 --> 00:47:21.540]   By the time they get around to actually convincing somebody
[00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:23.460]   to take a chance and spend their hard earned money
[00:47:23.460 --> 00:47:25.020]   to go with one or the other, you're going to be--
[00:47:25.020 --> 00:47:26.460]   Download it to your box.
[00:47:26.460 --> 00:47:26.980]   Yeah.
[00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:27.460]   So electronic--
[00:47:27.460 --> 00:47:28.660]   --we can try an definition.
[00:47:28.660 --> 00:47:30.020]   Telling you.
[00:47:30.020 --> 00:47:30.620]   Speaking of--
[00:47:30.620 --> 00:47:32.460]   Guys are living in a dream world.
[00:47:32.460 --> 00:47:32.980]   Really?
[00:47:32.980 --> 00:47:34.780]   You think that the online delivery
[00:47:34.780 --> 00:47:36.220]   or the disc delivery--
[00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:37.060]   Online's now.
[00:47:37.060 --> 00:47:38.860]   I can buy an online movie in HD now.
[00:47:38.860 --> 00:47:40.700]   I want you to mind waiting for hours.
[00:47:40.700 --> 00:47:42.380]   Well, you buy it before you go to bed.
[00:47:42.380 --> 00:47:43.620]   It's in there in the morning.
[00:47:43.620 --> 00:47:46.460]   I think you're a little bit of a different normal customer.
[00:47:46.460 --> 00:47:48.020]   I mean, the average person out there.
[00:47:48.020 --> 00:47:48.540]   No, wait a minute.
[00:47:48.540 --> 00:47:52.580]   An Xbox 360 is as mass consumer as you can get.
[00:47:52.580 --> 00:47:53.260]   Don't point at me.
[00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:54.180]   Point at John.
[00:47:54.180 --> 00:47:56.420]   I would, but he's not here.
[00:47:56.420 --> 00:47:58.420]   Seriously, can you get more mass consumer than that?
[00:47:58.420 --> 00:47:59.900]   This doesn't even acquire a computer.
[00:47:59.900 --> 00:48:01.380]   It's a console video game.
[00:48:01.380 --> 00:48:02.660]   It's a set-top box.
[00:48:02.660 --> 00:48:03.660]   Microsoft is now--
[00:48:03.660 --> 00:48:04.420]   It has an embedded amount.
[00:48:04.420 --> 00:48:06.180]   It has an-- people like--
[00:48:06.180 --> 00:48:07.780]   I don't know where this comes from personally,
[00:48:07.780 --> 00:48:11.260]   but people like to have stuff that they can collect.
[00:48:11.260 --> 00:48:14.140]   You cannot-- there's not enough room on the hard disks
[00:48:14.140 --> 00:48:17.180]   on the Xbox 360 to save more than a few movies,
[00:48:17.180 --> 00:48:20.340]   especially you can't have 100 of them on there at full HD.
[00:48:20.340 --> 00:48:21.300]   Well, how many can you have?
[00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:22.700]   So maybe you download them before.
[00:48:22.700 --> 00:48:24.340]   It's a PC that maybe we can back to--
[00:48:24.340 --> 00:48:27.140]   It's a 4-centric system where you download them to the PC,
[00:48:27.140 --> 00:48:28.140]   and then you--
[00:48:28.140 --> 00:48:29.060]   Now you're getting complicated.
[00:48:29.060 --> 00:48:30.500]   Nobody else can get a cable box.
[00:48:30.500 --> 00:48:31.060]   I'm not arguing.
[00:48:31.060 --> 00:48:32.180]   You're not using your cable box.
[00:48:32.180 --> 00:48:35.300]   It's going to happen that you'll have a 550 a month for cable.
[00:48:35.300 --> 00:48:37.220]   You'll have a 500 gig hard drive.
[00:48:37.220 --> 00:48:40.100]   Right now, it's moot because you can't buy the HD movies yet
[00:48:40.100 --> 00:48:41.900]   on the Xbox Live marketplace.
[00:48:41.900 --> 00:48:44.060]   You can only rent them.
[00:48:44.060 --> 00:48:45.300]   But I think it's just a matter of time
[00:48:45.300 --> 00:48:46.220]   before you can buy them.
[00:48:46.220 --> 00:48:49.020]   Coming down the hike that'll sell for $150,
[00:48:49.020 --> 00:48:52.220]   and it'll carry the disk format for another 10 years,
[00:48:52.220 --> 00:48:53.620]   and then we'll just--
[00:48:53.620 --> 00:48:54.540]   Electronic.
[00:48:54.540 --> 00:48:55.580]   Electronic.
[00:48:55.580 --> 00:48:58.220]   Nobody knows what a Blu-ray is right now.
[00:48:58.220 --> 00:49:00.060]   And I bet this clip shows up in a year from now
[00:49:00.060 --> 00:49:00.900]   in a best of Twitter.
[00:49:00.900 --> 00:49:01.900]   And everybody's mocking me.
[00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:04.820]   But that's the way it is.
[00:49:04.820 --> 00:49:08.020]   Well, it's like I remember the--
[00:49:08.020 --> 00:49:08.500]   Go ahead.
[00:49:08.500 --> 00:49:08.980]   Well, think about--
[00:49:08.980 --> 00:49:09.480]   Go ahead.
[00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:11.100]   I know what you're thinking.
[00:49:11.100 --> 00:49:15.420]   You know, remember when we were doing the show for MSNBC
[00:49:15.420 --> 00:49:17.260]   and we had to do these debates.
[00:49:17.260 --> 00:49:18.540]   We only did a few of them.
[00:49:18.540 --> 00:49:19.540]   That was fun, actually.
[00:49:19.540 --> 00:49:23.540]   But before AOL had its big run after you were going
[00:49:23.540 --> 00:49:24.340]   to go out of business.
[00:49:24.340 --> 00:49:25.340]   Yeah, I know.
[00:49:25.340 --> 00:49:26.300]   I'm an idiot.
[00:49:26.300 --> 00:49:29.340]   Although I kind of got it right because I remember one
[00:49:29.340 --> 00:49:32.140]   on one of them I was saying how Internet Explorer 3 came out.
[00:49:32.140 --> 00:49:32.740]   I said, this is it.
[00:49:32.740 --> 00:49:34.300]   It's over for Netscape.
[00:49:34.300 --> 00:49:35.940]   I remember I pissed Mark a Driesen off.
[00:49:35.940 --> 00:49:38.740]   He apparently was furious with me, and I was right.
[00:49:38.740 --> 00:49:41.060]   I said, sell your Netscape stock.
[00:49:41.060 --> 00:49:42.260]   So maybe I get one right.
[00:49:42.260 --> 00:49:44.140]   Nobody remembers the ones you get right.
[00:49:44.140 --> 00:49:45.300]   We've got to keep swinging.
[00:49:45.300 --> 00:49:46.380]   I also never hit it.
[00:49:46.380 --> 00:49:47.340]   Yeah, I'm a swinger.
[00:49:47.340 --> 00:49:47.860]   I don't know.
[00:49:47.860 --> 00:49:49.860]   You can predict this online thing.
[00:49:49.860 --> 00:49:52.740]   I mean, I agree that someday in the some distant future,
[00:49:52.740 --> 00:49:54.780]   yeah, everything's going to be done that way.
[00:49:54.780 --> 00:49:56.860]   But I don't see it in the near term
[00:49:56.860 --> 00:49:58.380]   because there's too much.
[00:49:58.380 --> 00:50:01.020]   This is like people are predicting blockbuster video
[00:50:01.020 --> 00:50:02.940]   is going to go out of business like whenever.
[00:50:02.940 --> 00:50:04.260]   I'm surprised they're still in business.
[00:50:04.260 --> 00:50:05.500]   I think the difference is though,
[00:50:05.500 --> 00:50:07.900]   you've got the double format that nobody understands.
[00:50:07.900 --> 00:50:10.180]   And neither one of them are willing to compromise in the lease.
[00:50:10.180 --> 00:50:11.700]   So people just don't want to pick it.
[00:50:11.700 --> 00:50:13.700]   They want to keep getting regular DVDs from now.
[00:50:13.700 --> 00:50:15.340]   By the time they actually figure it out,
[00:50:15.340 --> 00:50:16.580]   I think they let try to deliver these.
[00:50:16.580 --> 00:50:19.580]   The chip sets are already ready to go for double format.
[00:50:19.580 --> 00:50:21.700]   Yeah, but they won't let anybody sell them.
[00:50:21.700 --> 00:50:24.020]   Because there's a light, I'm telling you,
[00:50:24.020 --> 00:50:28.500]   I can't prove it, but the only evidence I have is anecdotal,
[00:50:28.500 --> 00:50:30.380]   which is that there is a deal.
[00:50:30.380 --> 00:50:32.860]   If you sign on to license one of these technologies,
[00:50:32.860 --> 00:50:34.820]   you can't do one of those drives.
[00:50:34.820 --> 00:50:36.940]   I think it was one of the Sony guys came out and said
[00:50:36.940 --> 00:50:40.260]   that they never ever were going to allow dual format players.
[00:50:40.260 --> 00:50:44.980]   Well, since both Patrick and I have now bought an HD DVD,
[00:50:44.980 --> 00:50:48.140]   I think it's going to probably come out in the next few days.
[00:50:48.140 --> 00:50:49.340]   A dual format.
[00:50:49.340 --> 00:50:51.860]   Yeah, I think that's pretty certain.
[00:50:51.860 --> 00:50:54.780]   So Michael Richards having enough trouble with his video.
[00:50:54.780 --> 00:50:58.340]   A school in Quebec has banned personal electronic devices
[00:50:58.340 --> 00:51:01.180]   in the classroom after students videotaped a teacher
[00:51:01.180 --> 00:51:03.780]   yelling at a student and the footage ended up on YouTube.
[00:51:03.780 --> 00:51:05.300]   (laughing)
[00:51:05.300 --> 00:51:07.900]   Two 13 year old girls has been suspended
[00:51:07.900 --> 00:51:09.980]   at the Echol second day of Montblau.
[00:51:09.980 --> 00:51:13.100]   And the teacher has taken a stress leave from work.
[00:51:13.100 --> 00:51:14.180]   I'll tell you.
[00:51:14.180 --> 00:51:15.340]   You gotta be careful.
[00:51:15.340 --> 00:51:16.420]   You gotta be careful.
[00:51:16.420 --> 00:51:17.900]   Where were the kids suspended?
[00:51:17.900 --> 00:51:20.300]   I don't know, 'cause they secretly taped it, I guess.
[00:51:20.300 --> 00:51:23.700]   Oh, they said that they did it because the one kid
[00:51:23.700 --> 00:51:25.460]   has purposely wound the teacher up
[00:51:25.460 --> 00:51:28.180]   and was purposely acting out in order that she'd snapped
[00:51:28.180 --> 00:51:29.900]   so the other one could film it.
[00:51:29.900 --> 00:51:31.220]   Well, it worked.
[00:51:31.220 --> 00:51:32.060]   It worked.
[00:51:32.060 --> 00:51:32.900]   It worked.
[00:51:32.900 --> 00:51:33.740]   It worked.
[00:51:33.740 --> 00:51:35.820]   I'm glad I didn't go to school in Quebec.
[00:51:35.820 --> 00:51:37.420]   Well, you know, the only way.
[00:51:37.420 --> 00:51:38.260]   The only way.
[00:51:38.260 --> 00:51:39.100]   The odd-do-month Suri.
[00:51:39.100 --> 00:51:41.620]   The teacher will be the master of his class.
[00:51:41.620 --> 00:51:42.460]   Can you believe that?
[00:51:42.460 --> 00:51:44.740]   The closed class and confidential.
[00:51:44.740 --> 00:51:45.620]   That's the quote.
[00:51:45.620 --> 00:51:48.260]   You are the master of your class.
[00:51:48.260 --> 00:51:50.660]   Well, you know, the only reason that those kids
[00:51:50.660 --> 00:51:52.340]   would do that stunt, you know, have one of them
[00:51:52.340 --> 00:51:54.060]   wind the teacher up is because this has been
[00:51:54.060 --> 00:51:56.100]   apparently going on and there's just
[00:51:56.100 --> 00:51:57.180]   evidence on this course.
[00:51:57.180 --> 00:51:58.180]   That's what I think.
[00:51:58.180 --> 00:51:59.020]   Oh, wow.
[00:51:59.020 --> 00:52:00.740]   Necessarily just gonna do that.
[00:52:00.740 --> 00:52:02.100]   Just arbitrarily.
[00:52:02.100 --> 00:52:05.500]   Well, do you have no memory of being a teenager, John?
[00:52:05.500 --> 00:52:08.020]   You don't think kids would just completely set someone up
[00:52:08.020 --> 00:52:08.860]   for a lot of people?
[00:52:08.860 --> 00:52:10.660]   Have you seen YouTube lately?
[00:52:10.660 --> 00:52:11.820]   Oh, there's a lot of stuff like that.
[00:52:11.820 --> 00:52:12.820]   Yeah.
[00:52:12.820 --> 00:52:13.820]   It's a brilliant marketing book.
[00:52:13.820 --> 00:52:14.820]   It's a brilliant marketing book.
[00:52:14.820 --> 00:52:16.820]   It's a brilliant marketing blog.
[00:52:16.820 --> 00:52:19.820]   But it won't be available on HCDBD or Blu-ray.
[00:52:19.820 --> 00:52:21.820]   Speaking of brilliant marketing, this is not a real ad,
[00:52:21.820 --> 00:52:23.820]   but have you seen the Google video for the eye talk?
[00:52:23.820 --> 00:52:25.820]   It's the DeSantis brothers.
[00:52:25.820 --> 00:52:28.820]   I presume that they make, it's a spec commercial,
[00:52:28.820 --> 00:52:30.820]   a non-existent commercial.
[00:52:30.820 --> 00:52:31.820]   I'll play it.
[00:52:31.820 --> 00:52:34.820]   I play in the video, of course, this is an audio podcast.
[00:52:34.820 --> 00:52:35.820]   You didn't have it.
[00:52:35.820 --> 00:52:36.820]   Let me show you Patrick's agency.
[00:52:36.820 --> 00:52:39.820]   It is a very sexy device.
[00:52:39.820 --> 00:52:41.820]   It's not real.
[00:52:41.820 --> 00:52:43.820]   It's floating through the air.
[00:52:43.820 --> 00:52:44.820]   It opens up.
[00:52:44.820 --> 00:52:47.820]   There's a version, a screen, a touchscreen.
[00:52:47.820 --> 00:52:50.820]   Maybe inside the eye, but it goes on the camera.
[00:52:50.820 --> 00:52:52.820]   Please video.
[00:52:52.820 --> 00:52:57.820]   I'll put a link in the description.
[00:52:57.820 --> 00:53:00.820]   Everybody can see this one more time.
[00:53:00.820 --> 00:53:02.820]   It's a complete spec commercial.
[00:53:02.820 --> 00:53:04.820]   But somebody puts it in the comments on YouTube.
[00:53:04.820 --> 00:53:07.820]   If that comes out, I'll pay any amount for it.
[00:53:07.820 --> 00:53:13.820]   Steve Jobs just squashed the intentions of releasing the iTunes
[00:53:13.820 --> 00:53:15.820]   phone before Christmas.
[00:53:15.820 --> 00:53:16.820]   We've seen this.
[00:53:16.820 --> 00:53:19.820]   I have to say, it's pretty cool.
[00:53:19.820 --> 00:53:21.820]   What's the URL?
[00:53:21.820 --> 00:53:22.820]   Well, it's Google Video.
[00:53:22.820 --> 00:53:27.820]   If you do a Google Video search for eye talk, I-T-A-L-K,
[00:53:27.820 --> 00:53:30.820]   you'll see the eye talk Apple's cell phone spec commercial.
[00:53:30.820 --> 00:53:32.820]   It's pretty impressive.
[00:53:32.820 --> 00:53:34.820]   These guys are good.
[00:53:34.820 --> 00:53:37.820]   It definitely has that Apple feel, doesn't it?
[00:53:37.820 --> 00:53:38.820]   It does.
[00:53:38.820 --> 00:53:41.820]   It's floating in space, elegance.
[00:53:41.820 --> 00:53:43.820]   They do say, of course, it's a spec.
[00:53:43.820 --> 00:53:45.820]   It's not real, but man, I want it.
[00:53:45.820 --> 00:53:49.820]   I think Secret's important that the manufacturer that makes the
[00:53:49.820 --> 00:53:53.820]   iPod's is one, the contract for producing the iPhones.
[00:53:53.820 --> 00:53:55.820]   So is it a Fox gun?
[00:53:55.820 --> 00:53:57.820]   Is it a Fox gun?
[00:53:57.820 --> 00:53:59.820]   The slave labor...
[00:53:59.820 --> 00:54:00.820]   Yeah.
[00:54:00.820 --> 00:54:01.820]   Oh, a Han-high precision.
[00:54:01.820 --> 00:54:02.820]   Oh, Han-high.
[00:54:02.820 --> 00:54:04.820]   They're making 12 million of them.
[00:54:04.820 --> 00:54:05.820]   Why?
[00:54:05.820 --> 00:54:06.820]   Wow.
[00:54:06.820 --> 00:54:11.820]   Podcast use is rising, but still no one's listening.
[00:54:11.820 --> 00:54:14.820]   Basically, according to the...
[00:54:14.820 --> 00:54:16.820]   And by the way, this is of all the stuff I've seen.
[00:54:16.820 --> 00:54:17.820]   This is...
[00:54:17.820 --> 00:54:19.820]   I would trust this is from the Pew Internet and American Life
[00:54:19.820 --> 00:54:20.820]   Project, which has done...
[00:54:20.820 --> 00:54:22.820]   been continuously doing these studies and I think is pretty
[00:54:22.820 --> 00:54:23.820]   reliable.
[00:54:23.820 --> 00:54:26.820]   12% of Internet users who've downloaded a podcast, that's up
[00:54:26.820 --> 00:54:31.820]   from 7% last year, but only 1% say they listen daily.
[00:54:31.820 --> 00:54:33.820]   And that's not changed at all.
[00:54:33.820 --> 00:54:36.820]   Somewhere are downloading, but fewer are listening.
[00:54:36.820 --> 00:54:37.820]   Man...
[00:54:37.820 --> 00:54:42.820]   It just doesn't seem right, based on anecdotal evidence.
[00:54:42.820 --> 00:54:45.820]   Like, you know, I'm pretty sure that everybody that we would
[00:54:45.820 --> 00:54:48.820]   ever talk to has got more into podcasting since this time
[00:54:48.820 --> 00:54:49.820]   last year.
[00:54:49.820 --> 00:54:51.820]   Yeah, but we're sort of a self-selecting group.
[00:54:51.820 --> 00:54:54.820]   Well, unfortunately, technology enthusiasts, many of which
[00:54:54.820 --> 00:54:57.820]   are bound by the lack of a certain network that shall remain
[00:54:57.820 --> 00:54:58.820]   nameless.
[00:54:58.820 --> 00:55:00.820]   You know, there's basically, there's been increasing volume
[00:55:00.820 --> 00:55:03.820]   of people, but, you know, people only have a finite amount of time.
[00:55:03.820 --> 00:55:05.820]   I think we've plateaued, actually.
[00:55:05.820 --> 00:55:06.820]   I don't know.
[00:55:06.820 --> 00:55:07.820]   How is DFT?
[00:55:07.820 --> 00:55:09.820]   It seems to me that our audience has plateaued.
[00:55:09.820 --> 00:55:10.820]   It's reached a peak.
[00:55:10.820 --> 00:55:12.820]   Is DLTV like that, or is it still going on?
[00:55:12.820 --> 00:55:14.820]   We'll go flat for a month, month and a half, and we'll grow
[00:55:14.820 --> 00:55:16.820]   like 50 or 90% and then, you know...
[00:55:16.820 --> 00:55:18.820]   That's probably based on marketing, right?
[00:55:18.820 --> 00:55:20.820]   Somebody said something in some public place.
[00:55:20.820 --> 00:55:23.820]   Actually, I think the two ones that I've been able to actually
[00:55:23.820 --> 00:55:26.820]   physically tie it to something, it was one was a slash dot
[00:55:26.820 --> 00:55:27.820]   reference.
[00:55:27.820 --> 00:55:28.820]   It stuck pretty heavily.
[00:55:28.820 --> 00:55:30.820]   But then those people stay, it's not an up-down blip, but it's
[00:55:30.820 --> 00:55:31.820]   an up-and-they-stay-there.
[00:55:31.820 --> 00:55:32.820]   We've consistently grown.
[00:55:32.820 --> 00:55:33.820]   It's good, you know.
[00:55:33.820 --> 00:55:34.820]   Usually it's...
[00:55:34.820 --> 00:55:35.820]   You know, it's probably...
[00:55:35.820 --> 00:55:37.820]   I don't see that it would be much different than blogging.
[00:55:37.820 --> 00:55:39.820]   I mean, if you do a blog long enough, you start to see this kind
[00:55:39.820 --> 00:55:40.820]   of organic growth.
[00:55:40.820 --> 00:55:41.820]   Right.
[00:55:41.820 --> 00:55:43.820]   And I think that, you know, with the Twitter broadcast, I mean,
[00:55:43.820 --> 00:55:46.820]   I think you were in early enough that you'd have this kind of
[00:55:46.820 --> 00:55:48.820]   dynamic growth that's...
[00:55:48.820 --> 00:55:51.820]   You ought to curiosity, and now I think you just have a natural...
[00:55:51.820 --> 00:55:53.820]   I mean, I'm sure the numbers are creeping up.
[00:55:53.820 --> 00:55:55.820]   Yeah, I would say they're creeping up.
[00:55:55.820 --> 00:55:56.820]   Yeah.
[00:55:56.820 --> 00:55:57.820]   And I...
[00:55:57.820 --> 00:55:59.820]   They're not going to jump, make any big jumps, but you know...
[00:55:59.820 --> 00:56:00.820]   They're not going down.
[00:56:00.820 --> 00:56:01.820]   I thank God for that.
[00:56:01.820 --> 00:56:03.820]   No, I don't think that's going to happen unless, you know.
[00:56:03.820 --> 00:56:05.820]   But anyway, let's suck.
[00:56:05.820 --> 00:56:06.820]   Let's be suck, which is...
[00:56:06.820 --> 00:56:07.820]   That can happen.
[00:56:07.820 --> 00:56:08.820]   There have been many of us said.
[00:56:08.820 --> 00:56:11.820]   But what I'm trying to say is that I think that the...
[00:56:11.820 --> 00:56:15.820]   You know, that there's always the possibility that some new
[00:56:15.820 --> 00:56:18.820]   methodology or technology or something comes around that
[00:56:18.820 --> 00:56:20.820]   makes podcasts retrieval and...
[00:56:20.820 --> 00:56:22.820]   That's what's going to happen.
[00:56:22.820 --> 00:56:23.820]   Easier.
[00:56:23.820 --> 00:56:24.820]   I'll tell you what it's going to be.
[00:56:24.820 --> 00:56:27.820]   It's got to be Microsoft putting it in a Vista.
[00:56:27.820 --> 00:56:30.820]   And I'm just really disappointed that it's not in the Zoom,
[00:56:30.820 --> 00:56:33.820]   it's not in Vista, it's not in Windows Media Player.
[00:56:33.820 --> 00:56:35.820]   You were the first one to break this to us, Patrick, and it's bad.
[00:56:35.820 --> 00:56:38.820]   Windows Media Player, the product manager for Windows Media Player
[00:56:38.820 --> 00:56:41.820]   11 would like to have basically the ability to subscribe to RSS
[00:56:41.820 --> 00:56:43.820]   feeds and downloads.
[00:56:43.820 --> 00:56:46.820]   It was not to be put into the initial ship version.
[00:56:46.820 --> 00:56:47.820]   I'm hoping this will revs.
[00:56:47.820 --> 00:56:48.820]   Yeah.
[00:56:48.820 --> 00:56:52.820]   At some point, the thing that could break podcasting wide open,
[00:56:52.820 --> 00:56:55.820]   I've said this many times, is put it on the Windows desktop,
[00:56:55.820 --> 00:56:58.820]   put it somewhere in Windows where it's easy to do,
[00:56:58.820 --> 00:57:00.820]   it's as easy as anything else.
[00:57:00.820 --> 00:57:04.820]   I've been thinking Wi-Fi and your MP3 player would be the thing,
[00:57:04.820 --> 00:57:05.820]   but you know what?
[00:57:05.820 --> 00:57:06.820]   I think you're right.
[00:57:06.820 --> 00:57:07.820]   I think it goes with a window.
[00:57:07.820 --> 00:57:08.820]   It blows up huge.
[00:57:08.820 --> 00:57:09.820]   Yeah.
[00:57:09.820 --> 00:57:12.820]   It's got to be a gadget on Windows Vista desktop or something like that.
[00:57:12.820 --> 00:57:15.820]   Well, the ITV attachment from Apple, that's got podcasting
[00:57:15.820 --> 00:57:17.820]   integrated right next to movies and TV.
[00:57:17.820 --> 00:57:18.820]   That will help.
[00:57:18.820 --> 00:57:19.820]   Yeah, but I don't know if that's like...
[00:57:19.820 --> 00:57:21.820]   Who wants to listen to a podcast on their TV, though?
[00:57:21.820 --> 00:57:26.820]   The ITV seems like a pretty expensive airport express device.
[00:57:26.820 --> 00:57:28.820]   That's basically what it is, I think.
[00:57:28.820 --> 00:57:29.820]   Yeah.
[00:57:29.820 --> 00:57:32.820]   It's the market penetration is not high enough and they don't have any
[00:57:32.820 --> 00:57:34.820]   PVR capability built into the front row.
[00:57:34.820 --> 00:57:37.820]   I'll buy one, though, because I have a lot of content on my computer
[00:57:37.820 --> 00:57:39.820]   and I'd like to get it to my TV.
[00:57:39.820 --> 00:57:40.820]   I mean, that's really...
[00:57:40.820 --> 00:57:41.820]   There's a market for something.
[00:57:41.820 --> 00:57:42.820]   Yeah.
[00:57:42.820 --> 00:57:43.820]   I mean, Tivo has podcasts.
[00:57:43.820 --> 00:57:44.820]   You can listen to podcast on Tivo 3.
[00:57:44.820 --> 00:57:46.820]   Yeah, Buzz out louds on Tivo.
[00:57:46.820 --> 00:57:47.820]   Yeah.
[00:57:47.820 --> 00:57:48.820]   Actually, Twits on Tivo.
[00:57:48.820 --> 00:57:50.820]   We're one of the preferred podcasts or something.
[00:57:50.820 --> 00:57:52.820]   But do people listen to audio podcasts?
[00:57:52.820 --> 00:57:53.820]   No, I don't think so.
[00:57:53.820 --> 00:57:56.820]   Because if you're sitting in front of your TV, you're not going to listen to an audio podcast.
[00:57:56.820 --> 00:57:57.820]   No, I don't think so.
[00:57:57.820 --> 00:57:59.820]   You're going to want a video podcast.
[00:57:59.820 --> 00:58:03.820]   You really have to be hard, up for entertainment to listen to us instead of watching TV shows.
[00:58:03.820 --> 00:58:04.820]   I think that's pretty much true.
[00:58:04.820 --> 00:58:06.820]   Yeah, sad to say.
[00:58:06.820 --> 00:58:15.820]   Let's see, Microsoft explains why now the license for Vista Home does not allow you to use virtual machines like
[00:58:15.820 --> 00:58:24.820]   Parallels or VMware because virtualization is not mature enough for home Vista users.
[00:58:24.820 --> 00:58:29.820]   Microsoft's perks push them to all ziti net age of virtualization.
[00:58:29.820 --> 00:58:35.820]   Despite its increasing implementation in business and server environments, just isn't ready for prime time.
[00:58:35.820 --> 00:58:39.820]   Well, they give them the give them the one hand they take with the other.
[00:58:39.820 --> 00:58:40.820]   What?
[00:58:40.820 --> 00:58:43.820]   Maybe they just can't assure stability of Vista if people are...
[00:58:43.820 --> 00:58:44.820]   Maybe it's Vista issue.
[00:58:44.820 --> 00:58:45.820]   Because they've already...
[00:58:45.820 --> 00:58:52.820]   At least they've given up on having a single license for a single machine forever on the home run.
[00:58:52.820 --> 00:58:57.820]   But you're going to need to buy professional or ultimate if you want to use VMware.
[00:58:57.820 --> 00:58:58.820]   Which I blame.
[00:58:58.820 --> 00:58:59.820]   They're going to be...
[00:58:59.820 --> 00:59:00.820]   There's seven, aren't there?
[00:59:00.820 --> 00:59:01.820]   There's seven.
[00:59:01.820 --> 00:59:05.820]   There's some home basic home series.
[00:59:05.820 --> 00:59:06.820]   I don't know.
[00:59:06.820 --> 00:59:07.820]   This is...
[00:59:07.820 --> 00:59:08.820]   We will not be quick.
[00:59:08.820 --> 00:59:09.820]   Home start running.
[00:59:09.820 --> 00:59:10.820]   That's good.
[00:59:10.820 --> 00:59:15.820]   Maybe they're just terrified that all these sort of home and home basic users are going to get blue pill.
[00:59:15.820 --> 00:59:19.820]   And like, you know, the hypervisor hack will just be the next like spirit.
[00:59:19.820 --> 00:59:22.820]   They're not going to get that from the VMware or from parallels.
[00:59:22.820 --> 00:59:23.820]   They're going to get it from blue pill.
[00:59:23.820 --> 00:59:24.820]   This is a lice.
[00:59:24.820 --> 00:59:26.820]   This is a money grab for expert users.
[00:59:26.820 --> 00:59:27.820]   Expert users don't...
[00:59:27.820 --> 00:59:29.820]   If you want it, you got to pay for it.
[00:59:29.820 --> 00:59:30.820]   Yeah.
[00:59:30.820 --> 00:59:36.820]   So it's just a little disingenuous of them to say, well, the problem is virtualization is not mature enough.
[00:59:36.820 --> 00:59:37.820]   You're not.
[00:59:37.820 --> 00:59:38.820]   What is that?
[00:59:38.820 --> 00:59:39.820]   You're not.
[00:59:39.820 --> 00:59:40.820]   What is that?
[00:59:40.820 --> 00:59:41.820]   Grow up.
[00:59:41.820 --> 00:59:42.820]   You grow up.
[00:59:42.820 --> 00:59:43.820]   You grow up.
[00:59:43.820 --> 00:59:45.820]   No, you grow up.
[00:59:45.820 --> 00:59:47.820]   Let's see.
[00:59:47.820 --> 00:59:49.820]   Any other stories this week that I've missed?
[00:59:49.820 --> 00:59:51.820]   I'm sure there's some big ones.
[00:59:51.820 --> 00:59:52.820]   I just...
[00:59:52.820 --> 00:59:53.820]   How do you see it?
[00:59:53.820 --> 00:59:54.820]   It is one year old.
[00:59:54.820 --> 00:59:55.820]   It's one year old.
[00:59:55.820 --> 01:00:01.820]   You know, I bought one finally because I thought it was mature and I have to say I was waiting to see what happened with the Wii and the PS3 and I was underwhelmed.
[01:00:01.820 --> 01:00:04.820]   So I said, you know, I think this Christmas is an Xbox 360 Christmas.
[01:00:04.820 --> 01:00:05.820]   I'm like, I can't say I'm unhappy.
[01:00:05.820 --> 01:00:09.820]   I got Tony Hawk 8, a project gave for my kid.
[01:00:09.820 --> 01:00:10.820]   What does that look good?
[01:00:10.820 --> 01:00:11.820]   That's pretty bad.
[01:00:11.820 --> 01:00:12.820]   That is so freakin' awesome.
[01:00:12.820 --> 01:00:13.820]   Man, does that look good.
[01:00:13.820 --> 01:00:16.820]   And Gears of War for me, which my wife saw me playing.
[01:00:16.820 --> 01:00:20.820]   She said, I had no idea you were such a creep.
[01:00:20.820 --> 01:00:21.820]   And then what do you get?
[01:00:21.820 --> 01:00:22.820]   A free cop.
[01:00:22.820 --> 01:00:27.820]   If you buy it from Amazon, I got a free copy of some driving game with the goal of the game is to create wrecks.
[01:00:27.820 --> 01:00:28.820]   That's fun.
[01:00:28.820 --> 01:00:29.820]   Kid loves that.
[01:00:29.820 --> 01:00:31.820]   It's called Highway 101.
[01:00:31.820 --> 01:00:34.820]   It's good to teach him, you know, the basics of driving.
[01:00:34.820 --> 01:00:37.820]   Okay, driving to that car over there.
[01:00:37.820 --> 01:00:38.820]   Oh, good move.
[01:00:38.820 --> 01:00:43.820]   So, you know, the one story I think that may be worth mentioning is the story that announced
[01:00:43.820 --> 01:00:45.820]   the death of the VHS tape.
[01:00:45.820 --> 01:00:46.820]   Yeah.
[01:00:46.820 --> 01:00:47.820]   Oh, the privacy.
[01:00:47.820 --> 01:00:48.820]   Yeah, that was just a column.
[01:00:48.820 --> 01:00:49.820]   But it's a good point.
[01:00:49.820 --> 01:00:52.820]   I mean, who's buying VHS recorders or VCRs anymore?
[01:00:52.820 --> 01:00:53.820]   Anybody?
[01:00:53.820 --> 01:00:56.820]   I mean, they still work better than these, you know, these...
[01:00:56.820 --> 01:01:02.820]   HD DVD, DVD recorders, which blow up discs still left and right half the time they don't work at all.
[01:01:02.820 --> 01:01:04.820]   I don't have any experience with these DVD.
[01:01:04.820 --> 01:01:06.820]   Who's using DVD recorders?
[01:01:06.820 --> 01:01:07.820]   Because I haven't used them.
[01:01:07.820 --> 01:01:08.820]   I had a cop out in the suck.
[01:01:08.820 --> 01:01:09.820]   I have one.
[01:01:09.820 --> 01:01:10.820]   I just...
[01:01:10.820 --> 01:01:16.820]   Just this morning dumped out a whole box of old VHS tapes that I transferred to DVD on my DVD recorder.
[01:01:16.820 --> 01:01:17.820]   That's cool.
[01:01:17.820 --> 01:01:18.820]   It works great.
[01:01:18.820 --> 01:01:19.820]   It works.
[01:01:19.820 --> 01:01:20.820]   Which one do you have, Tom?
[01:01:20.820 --> 01:01:22.820]   It's, uh, Panasonic.
[01:01:22.820 --> 01:01:24.820]   Yeah, that's the one I'm recommending to people.
[01:01:24.820 --> 01:01:25.820]   It seems to be better.
[01:01:25.820 --> 01:01:26.820]   How about you, Patrick?
[01:01:26.820 --> 01:01:27.820]   Which one do you have?
[01:01:27.820 --> 01:01:28.820]   I have a burner in my system.
[01:01:28.820 --> 01:01:29.820]   Oh, just in your system, you do it.
[01:01:29.820 --> 01:01:30.820]   Yeah.
[01:01:30.820 --> 01:01:31.820]   Well, how do you get the VHS in there?
[01:01:31.820 --> 01:01:35.820]   Because if I go through my system, I get better results because I'm using Black Star, which makes up...
[01:01:35.820 --> 01:01:36.820]   Yeah.
[01:01:36.820 --> 01:01:37.820]   Far as I'm...
[01:01:37.820 --> 01:01:38.820]   Oh, I'm just thinking...
[01:01:38.820 --> 01:01:40.820]   I'm thinking of what Tom's got, which is a standalone DVD recorder.
[01:01:40.820 --> 01:01:43.820]   Yeah, no, I've used a couple of standalone ones and they still blow up discs.
[01:01:43.820 --> 01:01:44.820]   They don't finalize all the time.
[01:01:44.820 --> 01:01:45.820]   Hmm.
[01:01:45.820 --> 01:01:49.820]   I've done probably 30 discs now and I haven't had a single one before.
[01:01:49.820 --> 01:01:51.820]   Have you tried the Panasonic's, uh, John?
[01:01:51.820 --> 01:01:52.820]   No.
[01:01:52.820 --> 01:01:53.820]   I think those are the best.
[01:01:53.820 --> 01:01:54.820]   Well, maybe they are.
[01:01:54.820 --> 01:01:55.820]   They're talking to everybody.
[01:01:55.820 --> 01:01:56.820]   35S-B.
[01:01:56.820 --> 01:01:57.820]   Yeah.
[01:01:57.820 --> 01:02:00.820]   But the other problem is like with the tape you can like record, you know, you can...
[01:02:00.820 --> 01:02:05.820]   You can record a bunch of stuff and you can stop it halfway through and then re-over-record.
[01:02:05.820 --> 01:02:10.820]   I mean, the tapes have so much more versatility than these... than these DVD writers.
[01:02:10.820 --> 01:02:12.820]   Why are you gonna do VR for that?
[01:02:12.820 --> 01:02:14.820]   Well, I mean, you can do all your stuff.
[01:02:14.820 --> 01:02:15.820]   I mean, you can do theoretical.
[01:02:15.820 --> 01:02:16.820]   We're gonna go through all your stuff.
[01:02:16.820 --> 01:02:18.820]   You can do theoretically, but when you try to do it, it's inconvenient.
[01:02:18.820 --> 01:02:19.820]   It's hard to do.
[01:02:19.820 --> 01:02:20.820]   It's hard to cue off.
[01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:21.820]   That's what the Motion Picture Association was telling professors.
[01:02:21.820 --> 01:02:22.820]   We'll just use videotapes.
[01:02:22.820 --> 01:02:25.820]   Why do you want to take excerpts from DVDs?
[01:02:25.820 --> 01:02:27.820]   What's wrong with videotapes?
[01:02:27.820 --> 01:02:30.820]   They neglect to mention macro vision, which is supposed to prevent you from doing it.
[01:02:30.820 --> 01:02:32.820]   Or the fact that a lot of titles are no longer...
[01:02:32.820 --> 01:02:35.820]   A lot of new titles aren't coming out on VHS.
[01:02:35.820 --> 01:02:37.820]   Is any... I mean, are any new titles?
[01:02:37.820 --> 01:02:38.820]   Can you get a key call on VHS?
[01:02:38.820 --> 01:02:41.820]   The store of VHS in the store.
[01:02:41.820 --> 01:02:42.820]   I mean, I wish...
[01:02:42.820 --> 01:02:43.820]   HHS...
[01:02:43.820 --> 01:02:45.820]   I mean, I've got it in the store.
[01:02:45.820 --> 01:02:48.820]   I had to convince my wife to stop doing it, frankly.
[01:02:48.820 --> 01:02:51.820]   Can you still get VHS in blockbuster over there?
[01:02:51.820 --> 01:02:52.820]   Yeah.
[01:02:52.820 --> 01:02:53.820]   Oh, yeah.
[01:02:53.820 --> 01:02:54.820]   We haven't got any VHS ever hit.
[01:02:54.820 --> 01:02:55.820]   Really?
[01:02:55.820 --> 01:02:56.820]   We've phased it out.
[01:02:56.820 --> 01:02:57.820]   Seriously?
[01:02:57.820 --> 01:03:01.820]   Because in England, like every blockbuster is basically like 99% DVD.
[01:03:01.820 --> 01:03:02.820]   Huh.
[01:03:02.820 --> 01:03:05.820]   No, at least my local blockbuster...
[01:03:05.820 --> 01:03:08.820]   Maybe it's half and half, but they have a lot of VHS tapes still.
[01:03:08.820 --> 01:03:09.820]   Right.
[01:03:09.820 --> 01:03:10.820]   He does it backward.
[01:03:10.820 --> 01:03:11.820]   We're backward.
[01:03:11.820 --> 01:03:14.820]   Actually, the Perkins are slow to change.
[01:03:14.820 --> 01:03:15.820]   Yeah.
[01:03:15.820 --> 01:03:16.820]   Well, we like our tape.
[01:03:16.820 --> 01:03:19.820]   And you know, you Brits, you just can have your DVD format.
[01:03:19.820 --> 01:03:20.820]   We don't care.
[01:03:20.820 --> 01:03:22.820]   And you have to also realize that we had...
[01:03:22.820 --> 01:03:25.820]   We're so far ahead of the Brits when it came to like,
[01:03:25.820 --> 01:03:30.820]   initiating rentals in a mass market that we get in there with a million tapes.
[01:03:30.820 --> 01:03:31.820]   I mean, what are we supposed to do?
[01:03:31.820 --> 01:03:32.820]   That's probably...
[01:03:32.820 --> 01:03:33.820]   Yeah, that's mostly what we just got out of.
[01:03:33.820 --> 01:03:34.820]   We got them.
[01:03:34.820 --> 01:03:35.820]   What do we got to do with them?
[01:03:35.820 --> 01:03:36.820]   Nobody's buying them.
[01:03:36.820 --> 01:03:37.820]   Actually, it's really funny.
[01:03:37.820 --> 01:03:41.820]   If you do a search on Amazon for VHS, you can get about 200,000 entries.
[01:03:41.820 --> 01:03:43.820]   You can get sorted by release date.
[01:03:43.820 --> 01:03:49.820]   And so the top four newest release dates are AC/DC Thin Lizzy and the Cure on the Rock Masters
[01:03:49.820 --> 01:03:51.820]   Rock Masters concert series.
[01:03:51.820 --> 01:03:53.820]   And they come out recently?
[01:03:53.820 --> 01:03:54.820]   Apparently Black Rain has just been re-released.
[01:03:54.820 --> 01:03:55.820]   Well, there you go.
[01:03:55.820 --> 01:03:57.820]   It's for the Wayne's World group.
[01:03:57.820 --> 01:03:59.820]   They're sitting in the garage or the basement.
[01:03:59.820 --> 01:04:02.820]   They got the VHS tape because the DVD player is upstairs.
[01:04:02.820 --> 01:04:04.820]   They want that Thin Lizzy.
[01:04:04.820 --> 01:04:05.820]   Scary.
[01:04:05.820 --> 01:04:10.820]   California Supreme Court ruled this week that an individual Internet user is protected from
[01:04:10.820 --> 01:04:15.820]   libel actions when they repost material written by others even if they've been told that
[01:04:15.820 --> 01:04:16.820]   material is libelous.
[01:04:16.820 --> 01:04:22.820]   So basically gives bloggers and web journalists the freedom to reprint even libelous communications,
[01:04:22.820 --> 01:04:23.820]   which kind of surprises them.
[01:04:23.820 --> 01:04:24.820]   That sounds a little broad.
[01:04:24.820 --> 01:04:31.820]   I mean, they're basically -- as long as you're quoting journalists have that right.
[01:04:31.820 --> 01:04:34.820]   You can say this person said this.
[01:04:34.820 --> 01:04:37.820]   And you can't get in trouble because they said it.
[01:04:37.820 --> 01:04:40.820]   Basically, this is the sticking of fork in Apple's attempt to shut down.
[01:04:40.820 --> 01:04:46.820]   Well, actually it's based on a website called Quack Watch.
[01:04:46.820 --> 01:04:47.820]   Oh, funny.
[01:04:47.820 --> 01:04:52.820]   Dr. Steven Barrett, who runs a website Quack Watch, sued Ilana Rosenthal over defamatory,
[01:04:52.820 --> 01:04:57.820]   allegedly the fanatory statements about Barrett that Rosenthal posted to Internet news groups.
[01:04:57.820 --> 01:05:01.820]   The statements were written by someone else, but Barrett's lawyers argued that Rosenthal was
[01:05:01.820 --> 01:05:04.820]   libel because she reposted them.
[01:05:04.820 --> 01:05:07.820]   Supreme Court said, "No, she's not libel."
[01:05:07.820 --> 01:05:09.820]   In fact, they overturned an appeals court ruling.
[01:05:09.820 --> 01:05:15.820]   The justices pointed to a precedent which suggests that, quote, "the publisher distributor
[01:05:15.820 --> 01:05:21.820]   distinction makes no difference for purposes of Section 230 immunity."
[01:05:21.820 --> 01:05:25.820]   So it's exactly what you said, Thomas.
[01:05:25.820 --> 01:05:30.820]   As journalists are protected, so are bloggers, which is great.
[01:05:30.820 --> 01:05:37.820]   Although the justices were uneasy in a part of the opinion that the prospect of blanket
[01:05:37.820 --> 01:05:41.220]   immunity for those who intentionally redistribute defamatory statements of the Internet has
[01:05:41.220 --> 01:05:42.820]   disturbing implications.
[01:05:42.820 --> 01:05:49.820]   Well, there's other disturbing implications, which is one that is very slowly was saying
[01:05:49.820 --> 01:05:56.220]   that maybe it's not disturbing to everybody, but it seems more and more likely over time
[01:05:56.220 --> 01:06:00.820]   that bloggers technically will be given pretty much the rights of journalists and--
[01:06:00.820 --> 01:06:01.820]   All except Josh.
[01:06:01.820 --> 01:06:06.820]   Josh, why do you think that's a bad thing, John?
[01:06:06.820 --> 01:06:09.820]   Why is that a bad thing?
[01:06:09.820 --> 01:06:14.820]   Well, because I think a lot of the-- I don't think it's a bad thing.
[01:06:14.820 --> 01:06:20.820]   I think it could be questionable in that that doesn't matter, as a lot of bloggers are 14
[01:06:20.820 --> 01:06:21.820]   years old.
[01:06:21.820 --> 01:06:25.820]   Yeah, I guess back in the days of the printing for a team, you have a lot of 14-year-olds
[01:06:25.820 --> 01:06:26.820]   amplating.
[01:06:26.820 --> 01:06:28.820]   So there was a bad tree there.
[01:06:28.820 --> 01:06:34.820]   It's an interesting point, because there is land like a really thin line between a professional
[01:06:34.820 --> 01:06:36.820]   blogger and a journalist.
[01:06:36.820 --> 01:06:39.820]   If you're a professional blogger, say a gadget website, how does that make you different
[01:06:39.820 --> 01:06:42.820]   from a tech journalist, quote, unquote?
[01:06:42.820 --> 01:06:47.820]   I tended to say that the bloggers should have the same rights and they should get the same
[01:06:47.820 --> 01:06:50.820]   trade shows, because sometimes I know they're kept out.
[01:06:50.820 --> 01:06:54.820]   But then some situations where they have circulation of five readers.
[01:06:54.820 --> 01:06:57.820]   Well, maybe that's the test is how it is, is it as you have to have a certain size?
[01:06:57.820 --> 01:07:00.820]   It's going to end up being the test, is really what your circulation is.
[01:07:00.820 --> 01:07:01.820]   But then how do you prove it?
[01:07:01.820 --> 01:07:03.820]   I mean, that's another issue, you know?
[01:07:03.820 --> 01:07:07.820]   The publishing system should not be your qualification for getting it or your prevention.
[01:07:07.820 --> 01:07:08.820]   Right, I agree.
[01:07:08.820 --> 01:07:10.820]   Internet, print, paper, what does it matter?
[01:07:10.820 --> 01:07:11.820]   It's how many readers you have.
[01:07:11.820 --> 01:07:12.820]   It's your influence.
[01:07:12.820 --> 01:07:13.820]   It's your importance.
[01:07:13.820 --> 01:07:14.820]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:07:14.820 --> 01:07:16.820]   There's nobody ever does.
[01:07:16.820 --> 01:07:22.820]   There's no trade show in North America that basically looks at, except maybe Web 2.0,
[01:07:22.820 --> 01:07:25.820]   that looks at your audience and primary measurement.
[01:07:25.820 --> 01:07:26.820]   It's like, are you a professional?
[01:07:26.820 --> 01:07:27.820]   They want to pass a paper.
[01:07:27.820 --> 01:07:32.820]   Yeah, they want to print out your web clips or they want an assignment letter from somebody
[01:07:32.820 --> 01:07:33.820]   a letterhead from the company.
[01:07:33.820 --> 01:07:35.820]   Most places don't even want that.
[01:07:35.820 --> 01:07:38.820]   The problem with these trade shows is they want to restrict, like, you know, they say, oh,
[01:07:38.820 --> 01:07:42.820]   I only professional is in a big problem with E3, but of course they want to say that their
[01:07:42.820 --> 01:07:43.820]   attendance numbers have gone up.
[01:07:43.820 --> 01:07:45.820]   So basically let anybody in because then they--
[01:07:45.820 --> 01:07:46.820]   And look what happened to E3.
[01:07:46.820 --> 01:07:49.820]   They stand these and say, you know, hey, we have record attendance.
[01:07:49.820 --> 01:07:50.820]   Ballroom somewhere.
[01:07:50.820 --> 01:07:54.820]   Yeah, but I mean, Will, if you're talking about something like CEMA or CES where there's
[01:07:54.820 --> 01:07:58.820]   100 to 200,000 attendees, an extra 200 journalists isn't really going to--
[01:07:58.820 --> 01:07:59.820]   Who's going to CES this year?
[01:07:59.820 --> 01:08:00.820]   That's true.
[01:08:00.820 --> 01:08:01.820]   Patrick's going.
[01:08:01.820 --> 01:08:03.820]   Yeah, I am too, but then we can start--
[01:08:03.820 --> 01:08:04.820]   You are?
[01:08:04.820 --> 01:08:07.820]   Well, because they want us to do some cranky news shows on it.
[01:08:07.820 --> 01:08:09.820]   Let me go back to what Patrick just said.
[01:08:09.820 --> 01:08:15.820]   The fact of the matter of CES is a little more restrictive than most of these shows.
[01:08:15.820 --> 01:08:17.820]   In my experience, they have--
[01:08:17.820 --> 01:08:21.820]   I've been sitting in the press room when they have required people to show clips.
[01:08:21.820 --> 01:08:22.820]   Sure.
[01:08:22.820 --> 01:08:24.820]   You know, they just don't let anybody in.
[01:08:24.820 --> 01:08:26.820]   I think, you know, they think it would be more liberal.
[01:08:26.820 --> 01:08:30.820]   They're not because they're worried sick about, you know, 1,000 bloggers getting in for free.
[01:08:30.820 --> 01:08:31.820]   I don't know if it's--
[01:08:31.820 --> 01:08:32.820]   I'll say, Will, have professional bloggers.
[01:08:32.820 --> 01:08:33.820]   If you're in then, get in.
[01:08:33.820 --> 01:08:34.820]   No, even so.
[01:08:34.820 --> 01:08:39.820]   I mean, I know a couple of years ago, they pretty much told them--
[01:08:39.820 --> 01:08:44.820]   I mean, a couple of years ago, I remember them pretty much not letting any bloggers in.
[01:08:44.820 --> 01:08:45.820]   Yeah.
[01:08:45.820 --> 01:08:49.820]   I think that was more because that became the scam for that show for people trying to get in.
[01:08:49.820 --> 01:08:54.820]   I mean, it's always funny because every so often, you'll see like a whole bunch of people trying to do the same thing to get into a show,
[01:08:54.820 --> 01:08:56.820]   especially something like CES or SEMA.
[01:08:56.820 --> 01:09:00.820]   Well, you know, which reminds me when I was the editor of Infoworld one year, we had a column
[01:09:00.820 --> 01:09:11.820]   that actually wrote a column, which I was pleased to print, describing in great detail how you can scam your way into any show with phony business cards and the rest of it.
[01:09:11.820 --> 01:09:13.820]   It's not that easy anymore.
[01:09:13.820 --> 01:09:15.820]   Well, I think it's still doable.
[01:09:15.820 --> 01:09:21.820]   But the fact of the matter is sometimes you do have to have some clips or something.
[01:09:21.820 --> 01:09:21.820]   I mean, I--
[01:09:21.820 --> 01:09:24.820]   I still don't go to a trade show without having clips in my bag.
[01:09:24.820 --> 01:09:30.820]   You know, because I've been like, I don't know, last seven CES's and they still haven't had me in their journalist database.
[01:09:30.820 --> 01:09:32.820]   So, Will, are you going to a CES this year?
[01:09:32.820 --> 01:09:33.820]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:09:33.820 --> 01:09:34.820]   And I know Tom, you are.
[01:09:34.820 --> 01:09:35.820]   Yeah, I'll be there.
[01:09:35.820 --> 01:09:37.820]   So I'm going to be the only one here.
[01:09:37.820 --> 01:09:38.820]   No, you're going to have to come.
[01:09:38.820 --> 01:09:39.820]   No, I'm coming.
[01:09:39.820 --> 01:09:40.820]   I'm doing Macworld.
[01:09:40.820 --> 01:09:41.820]   See, they've overlapped them, right?
[01:09:41.820 --> 01:09:42.820]   Yeah.
[01:09:42.820 --> 01:09:43.820]   So we're doing--
[01:09:43.820 --> 01:09:44.820]   Macworld, just come down for a day.
[01:09:44.820 --> 01:09:46.820]   We'll have to assign you a cost.
[01:09:46.820 --> 01:09:47.820]   Oh, assign me a cost.
[01:09:47.820 --> 01:09:48.820]   Whatever the hell you call it.
[01:09:48.820 --> 01:09:49.820]   Assign me a Macworld.
[01:09:49.820 --> 01:09:51.820]   And you can be a Macworld and we'll be at CES.
[01:09:51.820 --> 01:09:52.820]   That's a great idea.
[01:09:52.820 --> 01:09:53.820]   We'll do a Samuel cost.
[01:09:53.820 --> 01:09:59.820]   We're doing Mac Break Weekly on the 8th, which is the night of after Steve Jobs keynote.
[01:09:59.820 --> 01:10:03.820]   They're presumably going to make all of these announcements everybody's been waiting for.
[01:10:03.820 --> 01:10:05.820]   And we're going to do it in Dolby Headphone.
[01:10:05.820 --> 01:10:08.820]   Because production isn't complicated enough.
[01:10:08.820 --> 01:10:14.820]   So maybe we could figure out a way to get you guys involved, but you'll all be down in Vegas for that.
[01:10:14.820 --> 01:10:16.820]   So we'll be missing Twitch.
[01:10:16.820 --> 01:10:19.820]   So we'll do-- or it's not out of Twitch, it's a Mac Break Weekly.
[01:10:19.820 --> 01:10:20.820]   But it'd be fun to have you guys.
[01:10:20.820 --> 01:10:22.820]   Maybe we could figure out something to do.
[01:10:22.820 --> 01:10:28.820]   David's asked us to do a Twitch there on the stage that we're going to videotape it.
[01:10:28.820 --> 01:10:30.820]   But I thought nobody would be there.
[01:10:30.820 --> 01:10:32.820]   John, you always say you're never going.
[01:10:32.820 --> 01:10:34.820]   I've never heard you say ahead of time you're going.
[01:10:34.820 --> 01:10:36.820]   It's like, you know, they're one of the--
[01:10:36.820 --> 01:10:37.820]   It's making you go.
[01:10:37.820 --> 01:10:38.820]   You can blame Patrick.
[01:10:38.820 --> 01:10:40.820]   He's the one responsible for that.
[01:10:40.820 --> 01:10:42.820]   He's making me go to CES.
[01:10:42.820 --> 01:10:45.820]   All the people are listening saying, "Oh, I'm going to see this."
[01:10:45.820 --> 01:10:47.820]   We have all the shows in the world.
[01:10:47.820 --> 01:10:50.820]   I'm not going to CES is running high on the list.
[01:10:50.820 --> 01:10:51.820]   It's just so hard.
[01:10:51.820 --> 01:10:52.820]   It's so hard to get around.
[01:10:52.820 --> 01:10:53.820]   That's a junk.
[01:10:53.820 --> 01:10:54.820]   There's places crowded.
[01:10:54.820 --> 01:10:57.820]   The rooms are-- the hotels are full.
[01:10:57.820 --> 01:10:58.820]   People think we're whining.
[01:10:58.820 --> 01:11:02.820]   They don't get-- I mean, if you haven't done it, they don't understand how it's going
[01:11:02.820 --> 01:11:03.820]   to nightmares.
[01:11:03.820 --> 01:11:04.820]   It's like people you know that--
[01:11:04.820 --> 01:11:06.820]   Oh, yeah, I wish I could travel as much as, you know, as somebody.
[01:11:06.820 --> 01:11:10.820]   You talk to a traveling salesman who travels two weeks out of the month and goes all over
[01:11:10.820 --> 01:11:11.820]   the world.
[01:11:11.820 --> 01:11:12.820]   See how much he enjoys traveling.
[01:11:12.820 --> 01:11:13.820]   Yeah.
[01:11:13.820 --> 01:11:18.820]   Although some people really enjoy it, but they tend to be the odd one out in the plane.
[01:11:18.820 --> 01:11:21.420]   If you want to suggest a story for future Twits, it's simple.
[01:11:21.420 --> 01:11:25.540]   You've got to create a delicious account, d-e-l-dot-i-c-i-o-dot-u-s.
[01:11:25.540 --> 01:11:30.180]   And if you tag it for colon-twit, which is a little offensive sounding, but it's what
[01:11:30.180 --> 01:11:33.900]   you need to do for colon-twit, it will get to us.
[01:11:33.900 --> 01:11:37.900]   And we do pay attention to all of the suggestions because we like to know what you want to hear
[01:11:37.900 --> 01:11:38.900]   us talk about.
[01:11:38.900 --> 01:11:42.820]   Your comments are also welcome at the website, twit.tv registration is free.
[01:11:42.820 --> 01:11:44.500]   Although while you're there, you might consider a donation.
[01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:47.100]   You not only get an account there, but you get an account on our forums, our private
[01:11:47.100 --> 01:11:51.580]   forums, and the good feeling of knowing that you're supporting this podcast.
[01:11:51.580 --> 01:11:52.580]   We thanks.
[01:11:52.580 --> 01:11:57.660]   By the way, I really want to thank, I just got to download numbers, both cash fly and
[01:11:57.660 --> 01:12:00.300]   AOL that provide bandwidth with the Twit network.
[01:12:00.300 --> 01:12:03.820]   We're doing almost three terabytes a day now.
[01:12:03.820 --> 01:12:05.740]   And I just did a little calculation.
[01:12:05.740 --> 01:12:09.300]   It would be like 10 or 20,000 a month if we had to pay for this.
[01:12:09.300 --> 01:12:10.300]   It's outrageous.
[01:12:10.300 --> 01:12:14.540]   It actually would be like 40 if you wanted somebody with the same standard of...
[01:12:14.540 --> 01:12:15.540]   Right.
[01:12:15.540 --> 01:12:16.540]   Because we're getting Akamai and Cash Fly.
[01:12:16.540 --> 01:12:19.860]   At the top of the line, Akamai would be like 60 or 80.
[01:12:19.860 --> 01:12:24.860]   Well, AOL's Akamai and Cash Fly, of course, has the same kind of distributed servers.
[01:12:24.860 --> 01:12:26.940]   So we're getting really good service and it's donated.
[01:12:26.940 --> 01:12:32.740]   So I really want to thank them for making it possible to do these podcasts.
[01:12:32.740 --> 01:12:36.300]   Absolutely would be impossible without them.
[01:12:36.300 --> 01:12:37.620]   And I want to thank all you guys for showing up.
[01:12:37.620 --> 01:12:41.980]   John C. Devorax blog is Devorax.org/blog.
[01:12:41.980 --> 01:12:43.780]   Have a drink.
[01:12:43.780 --> 01:12:48.540]   Bill Harris, of course, is the editor in chief of BitTech, which is a great Brit enthusiast
[01:12:48.540 --> 01:12:50.580]   site at bit-tech.net.
[01:12:50.580 --> 01:12:52.340]   We'll just love it.
[01:12:52.340 --> 01:12:54.060]   And it's always great to get you on.
[01:12:54.060 --> 01:12:57.100]   Tom Merritt's at Buzz Out Loud and CNET.
[01:12:57.100 --> 01:13:00.500]   Is it best to go to buzz.cnet.com or where would you like people to go?
[01:13:00.500 --> 01:13:01.500]   Tom, you get to...
[01:13:01.500 --> 01:13:02.500]   BOL.CNET.com.
[01:13:02.500 --> 01:13:04.140]   Picture it to the 5K.
[01:13:04.140 --> 01:13:05.140]   Oh, BOL.
[01:13:05.140 --> 01:13:06.140]   Yeah.
[01:13:06.140 --> 01:13:08.420]   By the way, it is like 20 times better than Twit and it comes out every day.
[01:13:08.420 --> 01:13:09.420]   Yeah.
[01:13:09.420 --> 01:13:10.420]   No, I'm not kidding.
[01:13:10.420 --> 01:13:11.420]   I love it.
[01:13:11.420 --> 01:13:12.420]   I did it on Wednesday and it's so good.
[01:13:12.420 --> 01:13:17.060]   Veronica Belmont, Molly Wood and Tom Merritt just make that show fly by.
[01:13:17.060 --> 01:13:19.500]   Who else put a dark name face with you?
[01:13:19.500 --> 01:13:20.500]   Come on.
[01:13:20.500 --> 01:13:21.500]   Oh, really?
[01:13:21.500 --> 01:13:22.500]   It's not normally that good?
[01:13:22.500 --> 01:13:23.500]   You can't tell me that.
[01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:25.140]   I listen to it every day and I love it.
[01:13:25.140 --> 01:13:27.340]   BOL.CNET.com.
[01:13:27.340 --> 01:13:32.540]   And of course, Patrick is always great in DLL.TV twice a week.
[01:13:32.540 --> 01:13:34.140]   Twice a week.
[01:13:34.140 --> 01:13:39.780]   And Pranky Geeks is John's production also on the DLLTV.net work, whatever it is.
[01:13:39.780 --> 01:13:40.780]   I don't think we're a network.
[01:13:40.780 --> 01:13:41.780]   Well, that's two.
[01:13:41.780 --> 01:13:43.020]   There's a web page with video.

[01:13:48.300 --> 01:13:50.140]   We have product views ago from PC Magazine.
[01:13:50.140 --> 01:13:51.700]   And there's lots of good steps there.
[01:13:51.700 --> 01:13:52.700]   Some other stuff.
[01:13:52.700 --> 01:13:53.700]   Yeah.

[01:13:54.700 --> 01:13:56.900]   I mean, I just, I think it's so exciting.

[01:14:31.660 --> 01:14:34.260]   And five is better for you, Patrick, than four.
[01:14:34.260 --> 01:14:37.220]   I think it's better for those of us who are stuck in the corporate office.
[01:14:37.220 --> 01:14:38.220]   Right.
