[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.240]   This is going to be the cranky geeks edition.
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.480]   Can you start that one more time I was on the wrong side?
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:24.280]   My bad.
[00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.280]   Sorry.
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.120]   It's time for Twit this week at Tech.
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.880]   The show where we cover the latest tech news.
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.520]   This week the cranky geeks edition.
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.320]   Three of my favorite Twit contributors joining us at the roundtable.
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.040]   Philip Elmer DeWitt.
[00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.720]   A fortune, I mean a refugee from Fortune.
[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.040]   I was going to call you a fortunate refugee, but I guess that's not quite the same.
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.040]   He is an anti-magazine.
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.600]   Time and he's now got PED 30.
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.080]   P-E-D is initials 30 or 3.0.
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.080]   Apple 3.0.
[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.400]   That's the official name.
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.400]   But found at PED 30.com.
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.480]   It's all about Apple.
[00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:06.480]   How's it going?
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.480]   Going well?
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.040]   Yeah, it's a lot of fun.
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.400]   I have the freedom to leave town whenever I want to.
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.800]   I can talk about that later.
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.600]   There's a lot to be said for that.
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.400]   There may even be more to be said for that in November.
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.640]   Meanwhile, joining us to my right.
[00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.800]   We've got Om Malek.
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:30.760]   Always great to have Om, formerly of Gigah Om now an angel investor.
[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:39.640]   And I'm happy to say joining the podcast family at PicoPI.co.
[00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.360]   Thank you, Leo, for having me again.
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.840]   I'm actually a professional investor at True Ventures now.
[00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:46.840]   Oh.
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:47.840]   Not an angel.
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:48.840]   Not an angel.
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:49.840]   No, not an angel.
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.240]   You got money to burn.
[00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.600]   No, not really.
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:55.600]   That's great.
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.520]   You were an angel for a long time, right?
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:58.520]   Nope.
[00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:59.760]   Never was an angel.
[00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:00.760]   Never early stage.
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:01.760]   You were always...
[00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.400]   No, I just went professional.
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.920]   When pro at a young age, he dropped out of college to go pro.
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:10.920]   I wish.
[00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.640]   And we'll find out more about Pico in a little bit.
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.760]   Also joining us, my old buddy, Dave Corsi.
[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:18.760]   David is alone.
[00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:19.760]   Hello.
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:20.760]   Hey, at Corsi.com.
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.280]   I have nothing to sell anyone.
[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.280]   Isn't that nice?
[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.280]   I have nothing.
[00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.280]   I have nothing.
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.800]   I don't have a blog for you to read.
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.400]   I don't have a podcast.
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.400]   I got nothing.
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:32.400]   I got nothing.
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.400]   I got nothing.
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.740]   I'm here.
[00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.280]   That means you're here for the love of it.
[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.280]   The love of technology and the love of the affable Leo Le Port.
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.280]   Thank you.
[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:44.880]   And the free mic, we hope.
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:45.880]   Yeah.
[00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.720]   He's lobbying for a free mic.
[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:52.960]   David, before the show began, he said, "How many times do you have to appear on the show
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.520]   to get the PR40?"
[00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.440]   Well, David will get you one right away.
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.120]   Hey, Om has one.
[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.120]   I figured you out.
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.120]   Yeah, no.
[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.120]   Fair enough.
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.120]   Fair enough.
[00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.120]   Hey, let's start with the sad stories.
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.080]   And actually, a really shocking sad story earlier this week.
[00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:16.280]   The man who founded a sling box like Cricorion, who was much beloved, I think, at Silicon
[00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.200]   Valley, passed away suddenly at the age of 48.
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:20.200]   He was surfing.
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.360]   Om, you were a friend.
[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:22.360]   You knew him.
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.360]   Yeah, I did.
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.440]   I was quite shocked by his passing.
[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:36.440]   And I think, Blake and I met not too long ago, 2004, when he was doing sling media.
[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:41.080]   He had just started sling media a few months, a few.
[00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.440]   At least, that's what he told me.
[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:49.240]   And we talked a little bit about what comes after Tivo.
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:53.720]   And we talked about place shifting and just became friends.
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:58.720]   I think your editors tell you not to become friends with your sources.
[00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:03.840]   And in this case, I knew he was going to be his friend before he was a source.
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:07.720]   And literally, that's how our lives turned out to be.
[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:14.320]   And I got sick, I had my own heart condition and Blake would come pretty often to the city,
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:19.920]   spend hours at length with me and just keep me company sitting in a Starbucks, talking
[00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:25.480]   about tech and gossip about things and what the future looked like.
[00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:30.680]   And that's what he was, a guy who gave everyone everything he had.
[00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.400]   He just was one of the good guys.
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:38.680]   More importantly, he was a 10x engineer, software, hardware.
[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:39.680]   He could do it all.
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:44.760]   Think about it, in 2004, he made place shifting happen.
[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:51.920]   I mean, this is a world before APIs and internet connectivity, which was pervasive and cheap
[00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:54.880]   computers and cheap processors.
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.920]   This guy just hacked it all together.
[00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:01.080]   I mean, it takes a very special person to do that.
[00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:08.640]   And he was the old school Silicon Valley guy, which was like the value system was not only
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:14.800]   to win yourself, but do it with technology and do it with others and always help others.
[00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.000]   This guy just helped everyone.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.760]   I don't think he ever had a negative thing to say about anyone.
[00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:31.040]   He would basically give you a shirt off his back if he felt you could benefit from it.
[00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:34.680]   He was a really great guy and we became good friends.
[00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:39.600]   He actually got very mad at me for leaving journalism and he said, "Why would you do
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:40.600]   that?"
[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:44.640]   And I think sometimes other people know you better than you do.
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:48.760]   He was one of those people, a really special human being.
[00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:55.000]   It took me two days to come to terms with the whole thing.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.440]   I can't say any shock at that age.
[00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:03.000]   What a loss it is for the community, his family, everybody.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.880]   He's just truly one of the great ones.
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:07.880]   Well he will be missed.
[00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:10.600]   His family left at least behind two daughters and a wife.
[00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:14.480]   I don't know how old his daughters are, but at his age they're probably not very old.
[00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:17.240]   So even greater tragedy.
[00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:22.160]   I mean, I just say they don't make people like him anymore.
[00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:27.720]   I've been around the valley like you and Philip and David for a very long time.
[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:33.960]   This is the old school capable, very capable person.
[00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:34.960]   Yeah.
[00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:39.800]   We need more engineers running companies, if you ask me.
[00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:41.800]   People with technology backgrounds.
[00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:49.520]   Also passing this week at a little bit more of a senior age, Seymour Pappert, he was 88.
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:51.000]   He invented logo.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:59.240]   And if you ever use Lego mindstorms, mindstorms were named after his seminal book, Mindstorm,
[00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:07.880]   Children, Computers and Powerful Ideas, he was a genius in the early days of AI and very
[00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:08.880]   inspirational.
[00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:10.440]   You knew him, Philip, right?
[00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:12.240]   I worked with him.
[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:16.920]   Our careers crossed a couple times.
[00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:18.800]   He was one of the giants.
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:27.240]   He was a student of Jean Piaget, the French psychologist who first mapped how children
[00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:33.280]   learned, how the brain developed, when children were ready for certain ideas and when they
[00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:35.080]   weren't.
[00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:40.960]   Piaget said that Pappert was the only student who really understood the theory.
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:48.800]   And then Pappert came, he was a South African, he came to Harvard, and I came to MIT and
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:58.800]   was very influential in helping Marvin Minsky develop the early ideas about AI.
[00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:02.640]   And he and Marvin started the MIT AI lab.
[00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:10.480]   By the time I was just a kid, basically a paid intern at Bull Brannock and Newman when
[00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:14.840]   Pappert was there developing logo.
[00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:20.400]   And he had this very idealistic idea that this computer language, which was basically
[00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:26.800]   a baby version of Lisp with a lot of powerful tools, recursion.
[00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:28.040]   And that was the main thing.
[00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:33.040]   There's a recursive language and everything was done recursively.
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:38.680]   And it would have been, and he had this idea that if you give kids logo and they just play
[00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:48.200]   with it, they learn by playing, by, he compared it to how an art class, how kids play with
[00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:53.640]   clay and work it and work it until they get something that they really like.
[00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:59.400]   And he says, that's how mathematicians enjoy mathematics, but it's not at all like how
[00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:01.240]   math is taught in school.
[00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:06.560]   Anyway, logo was a great idea.
[00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:14.200]   He tried to push it in the schools, but basic, which was a pretty ugly, ugly language, full
[00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:15.600]   of problems.
[00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:17.680]   And that's the one that got taught.
[00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:19.920]   It was a very sad story to watch.
[00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:25.480]   It was kind of like, maybe I shouldn't say, it was kind of like watching the PC take over
[00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:28.720]   the computer industry and the Mac.
[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:31.120]   So the Amazon Maxitran.
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:32.120]   Come sorry, that was a little video.
[00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:34.640]   I was going to show some turtle graphics, which was.
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:35.640]   Sure, do it.
[00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:40.440]   Many people watching this probably had turtle graphics in their grade schools.
[00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:43.800]   You had a little turtle with a pen attached.
[00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:48.800]   And the idea was to, this is a on-screen turtle graphics, but the idea was, and if you look
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:57.080]   at this, you'll recognize, there you go, you'll recognize kind of small talky language, but
[00:11:57.080 --> 00:12:02.880]   the app inventor from Google, which was later taken over by MIT, when it's a very easy way
[00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:09.000]   to program for Android, is also kind of the same drag and drop, socketed language.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.600]   This is scratch we're looking at, and this is the turtle graphics and scratch.
[00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:15.520]   Scratch is essentially a small talk language.
[00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:21.600]   This was a whole movement that you're right, in many ways, is Sad Philip, that we got sidetracked
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:28.080]   by kind of the wrong direction here, and we're still paying the price a little bit for it.
[00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:29.840]   But many kids learned logo in school.
[00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:35.400]   I don't think they teach it anymore, but it sure would be a good thing to bring back.
[00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:39.520]   He was also a real gentle soul.
[00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:43.440]   He got badly heard in a traffic accident.
[00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:47.600]   I think he got hit by a truck or something, so he's been out of it for some time.
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:50.960]   Well, not quite the same story.
[00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:57.080]   Yeah, anyway, I hate to begin with obituaries, but there were some reasons to do that.
[00:12:57.080 --> 00:13:04.240]   There is still, I guess, if you want to get your kids into turtle graphics, there's turtleacademy.com,
[00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:10.800]   where you can still learn programming using logo and turtle graphics, and you don't have
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:13.400]   to be in school to do it.
[00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:21.080]   That's the one thing I have to say that is going well in this world is if you are motivated,
[00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:26.880]   you can learn anything you want online, including languages that have long been deprecated because
[00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:29.920]   basic one.
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:32.920]   As long as we're talking to Philip, let's talk about Apple a little bit.
[00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:37.680]   Great article I thought by Sam Biford in The Verge, which many people have said for years,
[00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:45.000]   is an Apple, pro-Apple blog, but in this case, in his first-click column, Sam says, "Apple
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:55.080]   should stop selling four-year-old computers 1,514 days, four years, one month, and 24
[00:13:55.080 --> 00:14:00.200]   days, since Apple released the last MacBook Pro without a retina display."
[00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:03.280]   It's been two years for a Mac mini.
[00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:11.120]   If you go to Mac, the Mac rumors site where you can decide whether you should buy a Mac,
[00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:18.400]   it says, "Do not buy on every single Mac except the MacBook," because they're way overdue.
[00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:22.040]   The retina MacBook Pro is 442 days old.
[00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:24.880]   The Mac mini 657 days old.
[00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:30.480]   Yeah, this is a story that really hits computer writers where it hurts.
[00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:33.480]   Over, baby.
[00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:37.000]   We're the ones who use these machines.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.760]   Here are people bitching on podcasts all over the internet.
[00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:46.640]   Apple, it's making its money on the iPhone.
[00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:49.440]   Most of it's two-thirds of its money.
[00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:54.680]   That's how Wall Street judges the company based on the iPhone.
[00:14:54.680 --> 00:15:02.120]   It is not in the business of doing what the computer writers want for their dustoffs.
[00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:03.600]   It has the money.
[00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:06.920]   I think probably what it lacks is the engineers.
[00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:08.920]   They just have a fairly...
[00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:14.760]   They don't have that many people who can make this stuff, so they're off making other things.
[00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:20.880]   I assume something will get updated this fall.
[00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:24.760]   You're one of the people who thinks an iPad Pro really is the next computer.
[00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:26.400]   You don't need a MacBook.
[00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:34.240]   No, I think I opened my MacBook Pro today after 10 days, mostly because I have to get
[00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:36.080]   on this podcast with you.
[00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:37.520]   It's our fault.
[00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:40.960]   I'm going to make you use a computer whether you like it or not.
[00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:47.400]   Well, there's still a lot of things you can't do with the iPad, which is like do podcasts
[00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:51.840]   and stuff like that.
[00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:54.920]   If I was doing this on my own, I would happily use that.
[00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:57.640]   We make you use Skype, but you could easily.
[00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:00.160]   I use my iPad for pretty much everything.
[00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:02.760]   I write on it.
[00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:05.800]   I edit my photos on it.
[00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:07.600]   It just is easier to use.
[00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:10.760]   I think people get really caught up in...
[00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:14.560]   It's like Apple controls, everything on that iPad.
[00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:16.840]   But I don't have to worry about viruses.
[00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:22.440]   I don't have to worry about it crashing on me all the time and any of those things.
[00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:24.480]   It just does a good job for me.
[00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:26.400]   For me, that's fairly good.
[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:29.320]   I do need a new computer.
[00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:35.120]   I would love to have a new MacBook Pro so I can edit my photos on Lightroom.
[00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:42.480]   I too have a three-year-old MacBook Pro.
[00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:48.040]   The thing starts levitating every time I open Photoshop or Lightroom.
[00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:51.200]   I'm not really sure what to do about that.
[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:56.680]   But I would say that we have to just stop thinking about computers from the way they
[00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:58.280]   were in the past.
[00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:01.400]   We have to think about them and what they can be in the future.
[00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:03.280]   I think that's the most important thing.
[00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:08.520]   David, is it just nostalgia that makes people sad about losing computers?
[00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:15.160]   I wonder what it is that we need to do that we can't already do.
[00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:16.160]   I have Macintosh.
[00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:21.840]   I have a very old Macintosh I use and I had to really clean it up to get it going fast
[00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:22.840]   again.
[00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:28.080]   But there's not that much that I need to do that that machine won't do.
[00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:34.960]   Not having a machine that is obsolescent every year or two years is a wonderful thing.
[00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:37.520]   What's Macintosh going to do that it doesn't do today?
[00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:39.120]   Yes, it could be faster.
[00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:40.320]   Yes, it could be this.
[00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:42.240]   Yes, you could put more memory in it.
[00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:46.240]   But the applications aren't driving it to need a whole lot more.
[00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:50.680]   It's true for the first 30 years of the personal computer revolution hardware was desperately
[00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:56.240]   trying to keep up with these massively bloated graphical operating systems.
[00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:59.040]   But it's caught up and it's fast enough.
[00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:01.400]   It's been fast enough for years.
[00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:02.440]   So you make a good point.
[00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:05.400]   It's not like we have to have a new computer.
[00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:07.320]   Maybe we just want a new computer.
[00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:11.360]   And Apple probably wants to remove a few ports.
[00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:13.120]   Well, that's the other thing.
[00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:16.240]   I mean, I don't know what this is going to be a come in the fall.
[00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:20.000]   We're only about a month off from an Apple iPhone announcement.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:25.880]   And we're close enough now that the rumor mill coming out of the suppliers in China is
[00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:27.520]   probably pretty accurate.
[00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:33.080]   So I think it's safe to say that at least one of the new iPhones will not have the antiquated
[00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:36.520]   obsolete who needs it headphone port.
[00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:44.680]   But you'd think that this would not be a good quarter for Apple to make an iPhone that will
[00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:51.880]   turn people off with one of the big selling features.
[00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:53.880]   What are you looking for?
[00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:55.200]   Your face stopped moving.
[00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:56.920]   But now that it's moving again, I feel much better.
[00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:57.920]   I just was worried.
[00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:03.320]   Maybe you had a stroke or something and we were talking somehow magically.
[00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:04.320]   You had an over it.
[00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:09.200]   Well, and then I had a look because neither David or Rome were moving much, obviously intent
[00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:10.520]   on what you're saying.
[00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:11.920]   But they were blinking at least.
[00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:12.920]   You were not.
[00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:13.920]   There was nothing going on.
[00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:17.200]   I use the headphone jack on my iPhone almost every night.
[00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:18.200]   Yeah.
[00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:20.800]   I mean, I don't think this is obsolete.
[00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:24.640]   No, there's been so much written about this.
[00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:26.400]   I hate to even open it up.
[00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:29.200]   Here's Neelai Patel's great article from a few weeks ago.
[00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:35.720]   Using the headphone jack off phones is user hostile and stupid.
[00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:42.480]   Can I just bring one point to this debate around the headphone jack?
[00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:43.480]   Yes.
[00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:46.080]   Remember how much you guys complained about the floppy?
[00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:47.080]   Floppy.
[00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:48.080]   Floppy's.
[00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:49.080]   That's the USB.
[00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:51.080]   It's like, just seeing a...
[00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:53.080]   That's John Heave Groobers defense.
[00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:55.040]   He said, "Hey, Apple's good at this."
[00:19:55.040 --> 00:20:01.080]   I think this is what they do is they try and push the envelope a little bit.
[00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:03.720]   In my opinion, it's just like, it's their prerogative.
[00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:10.720]   So if you don't like it, you can always switch to Android or whatever else you is out there.
[00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:11.720]   Well, that's my question.
[00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:17.160]   I wonder if Apple will, for the first time ever, they're seeing drops in sales.
[00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:22.000]   See a significant drop in iPhone use because I think consumers want headphone ports.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   Groobers theory.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   What?
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.200]   You're wearing headphones right now.
[00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:30.360]   You're wearing the white headphones that came with your iPhone.
[00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:33.080]   I will wear the different ones when they come out.
[00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:36.840]   They won't work though because they'll be lightning jack.
[00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:38.080]   And they won't work by me.
[00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:42.320]   It's like, all I will use, like the wireless headphones which I can buy.
[00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:45.280]   Like, I mean, I think it just is...
[00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:49.320]   It's the wrong reasons to be like debating around, you know, Apple.
[00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:51.800]   I think there's a lot of other problems they have.
[00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:52.800]   I think...
[00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:54.240]   Oh, I'm just piling on.
[00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:55.840]   This is just one more mini.
[00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:56.840]   I'm not playing.
[00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:59.600]   I like Groobers theory.
[00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:04.880]   Groobers theory is that there's something Apple is...
[00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:07.160]   No one can figure out why they're doing it this year.
[00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:09.040]   Why are they taking the jack off this year?
[00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:14.960]   And his theory is that there's something they're doing for this 10 year anniversary...
[00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:17.360]   It is the 10th anniversary iPhone, isn't it?
[00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:19.240]   That's next year, not this one.
[00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:26.040]   And for some reason that one doesn't want to have the usual jack.
[00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:28.760]   So they're warming people up for it.
[00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:35.840]   As he put it, they're going to eat the sh*t burger with this phone and then clean up with
[00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:36.840]   the one afterwards.
[00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:37.840]   Yeah, that's risky though.
[00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:39.040]   This is your product at this point.
[00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:43.200]   You're not updating the computers, the iPad sales of tanks.
[00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:44.200]   Your product...
[00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:45.440]   The watch is not going anywhere.
[00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:47.440]   Your product is an iPhone.
[00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:51.880]   It's a bold move, maybe a really stupid move.
[00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:58.560]   It feels a little bit like a Johnny I've designed driven thing rather than marketing.
[00:21:58.560 --> 00:21:59.560]   How about this?
[00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:05.720]   Our friend Steve Gibson, who's security now, came up with a really interesting theory that
[00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:10.520]   if you're going to take away the iPhone, Apple on September, whatever, 6 is going to have
[00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:17.400]   to say something more than just, "Oh, it makes it thinner or gives us more room for a battery."
[00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:21.280]   It's going to have to give us some value in return for losing the iPhone.
[00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:25.480]   Jack Steve says, "Well, because you're now connecting your headphones to the lightning
[00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:30.320]   adapter, you can now do more with that headphone.
[00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:34.880]   For instance, what if Apple started selling noise canceling headphones?
[00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:41.360]   What if all the earbuds that came with your iPhone did noise canceling, sophisticated noise
[00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:46.060]   canceling because you've got a very sophisticated processor and you've got a data port as well
[00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:47.960]   as a headphone port?"
[00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:50.120]   Not a bad theory.
[00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:52.120]   That'd be value add.
[00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:53.120]   You know what?
[00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:54.120]   They did that.
[00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:56.160]   They asked, "Look how much Bose gets for those quiet comfort headphones?"
[00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:58.640]   If they announced that and they said, "Hey, this is part of it."
[00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:02.600]   There's another thing, headphones are going to be, or earphones are going to be the ultimate
[00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:06.000]   wearable I think because when you wear, we don't want to get rid of them.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.960]   When you wear them, what this thing in your ear can do a lot more than just give you sound.
[00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:14.640]   It can measure your blood pressure, your oxygen level.
[00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:16.580]   Of course, it can measure your heart rate.
[00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:20.580]   The ear canal is a really good place for medical wearables.
[00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:24.460]   Might be another additional feature Apple could add.
[00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:31.820]   They're all going to cost more though and they're all going to need to be recharged overnight.
[00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:34.860]   I guess it depends on what Apple gives us in the way of...
[00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:35.860]   But that's the point.
[00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:38.260]   You don't have to recharge them because you've got the lightning port.
[00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:40.020]   The phone is the battery, right?
[00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:42.020]   No, I'm thinking of the wireless ones.
[00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:43.020]   Really?
[00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:44.020]   I don't think wireless is where we're going.
[00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:47.720]   I interviewed David Hennemire Hanson who has created Ruby on Rails on Monday and he said,
[00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:48.760]   "Oh no, this is great.
[00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:50.320]   Who wears wired headphones?
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:54.840]   I want all those years back that I spent untangling my headphones."
[00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:55.840]   I don't know.
[00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:56.840]   Is the world ready?
[00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:57.840]   Is that where we're going?
[00:23:57.840 --> 00:23:58.840]   Wireless?
[00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:01.400]   I think that I have to assume that's what Apple is planning.
[00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:04.240]   I don't know if it happens this year and I don't think they're going to give it away
[00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:06.840]   because those things are expensive.
[00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:12.560]   Well, that's the cynics answer is you can't license a mini jack.
[00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:16.740]   Make sure as hell can license a lightning port and with that comes license revenues.
[00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:23.700]   Anyway, let's hear more of what's wrong with Apple.
[00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:26.940]   Who wants to take a shot at Apple?
[00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:28.100]   Anybody?
[00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:30.740]   There was some good stuff.
[00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:32.820]   I'll give you something wrong with Apple.
[00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:38.620]   Here they go replacing a perfectly good gun emoji with a squirt gun.
[00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:42.500]   What the hell is wrong with these people?
[00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:48.720]   Well, I'm sure it comes out of political correctness or some version of that.
[00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:57.980]   I love the little twist that because it's a squirt gun on the Apple apps, but in everybody
[00:24:57.980 --> 00:24:59.740]   else's app, it's a real gun.
[00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:03.460]   Someone had a neat graphic that showed them all at once.
[00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:08.860]   You could say come to our water party and bring your squirt gun, but in everybody else's
[00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:14.900]   app, it shows up as a pistol, a 38 police special.
[00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:22.300]   Yeah, this is emoji Pedia, the folks who really great website explains what emojis mean.
[00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:24.540]   And they actually raised a great issue.
[00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:26.020]   At first I thought, oh, that's great.
[00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:27.380]   Why should we have gun emojis?
[00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:29.380]   Have a toy gun emoji.
[00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:30.380]   That's good.
[00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:33.260]   But this is a communications medium.
[00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:39.060]   And when you say 2 p.m. tomorrow local park, bring it and you put a squirt gun on iOS 10,
[00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:40.940]   by the way, it's not going to be in iOS nine right now.
[00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:42.980]   It's in iOS 10 coming.
[00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:48.220]   It may look like you have a different agenda when you see it on Android or Windows phone
[00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:50.820]   or Samsung phone.
[00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:52.820]   That's a good point.
[00:25:52.820 --> 00:26:00.060]   What are we saying that Apple users will ultimately be outgunned?
[00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:02.540]   They brought a squirt gun to an I fight.
[00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:03.540]   No, that's right.
[00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:04.540]   Come to the NRA picnic.
[00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:06.780]   Apple users, bring your squirt gun.
[00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:07.780]   I can see that.
[00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:08.780]   Yeah.
[00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:15.580]   You know what I love is the you wanted to talk about the planet of the apps, which sounds
[00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:17.660]   like I do want to talk about this.
[00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:21.500]   Yes, but but that holds no appeal for me.
[00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:25.500]   I don't like reality shows in general, but this is Apple's language.
[00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:30.180]   Is that they bought an exclusive on carpool karaoke, which I'd only heard about the day
[00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:33.020]   before because Michelle Obama was in it.
[00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:34.020]   Do you know this show?
[00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:35.020]   Yeah.
[00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:36.980]   Well, it wasn't a show as James Corden.
[00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:41.380]   Yeah, it says late late late night show and he it's been wonderful.
[00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:43.220]   It's actually the only good thing on the show.
[00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:49.700]   I'm not a huge fan of the show, but he gets in the car driving and famous people join
[00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:53.380]   him and it's it's always fun.
[00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:57.660]   So apples is the exclusive rights and they're going to put it on Apple music.
[00:26:57.660 --> 00:26:58.980]   What do you mean he's leaving?
[00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:00.460]   He's not going to he's not going to do it anymore.
[00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:02.500]   Now he's not going to host it anymore.
[00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:03.820]   They're looking for a host.
[00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:09.500]   Well, that's terrible because car whole point of carpool karaoke is that he is a very accomplished
[00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:11.900]   singer and funny.
[00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:15.260]   Yeah, he loves what I read.
[00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:19.700]   Yeah, they are I think they're spinning it out into a TV series and Apple buys it.
[00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:23.500]   Now that doesn't mean that means if you want to watch it, you'll have to get it on iTunes,
[00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:24.500]   right?
[00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:28.740]   Or if you want to watch it fresh, it may be some kind of windowing.
[00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:33.860]   It's really been the single thing that James Corden show.
[00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:39.020]   This has been the great social media viral part of the show.
[00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:41.300]   It's the only reason I know about the show.
[00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:45.620]   Yeah, he's almost hit a billion views on YouTube.
[00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:49.540]   Here he is trying to talk his way into the White House.
[00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:52.100]   Sound in the wrong place.
[00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:53.740]   I'll back up if you give me my license.
[00:27:53.740 --> 00:27:54.740]   Sir, do not back up.
[00:27:54.740 --> 00:28:01.980]   When you put the car in drive, pull off to the right up there, please.
[00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:04.380]   And I'll give you further instructions once we get up there.
[00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:06.380]   Oh my God.
[00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:08.620]   I should not do touristy things.
[00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:10.500]   I should not do touristy things.
[00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:15.100]   He is quite funny, but then eventually of course the first lady gets in the car.
[00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:17.100]   We were both fully in the beehive.
[00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:19.380]   We just dropped the mic.
[00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:20.380]   We were making honey there.
[00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:21.380]   We were in the behind.
[00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:22.380]   We were in the behind.
[00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:23.380]   We were in the behind.
[00:28:23.380 --> 00:28:24.740]   I want to see them singing.
[00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:26.180]   Let's see them singing here.
[00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:27.180]   Real cheese sandwich.
[00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:29.620]   I can make fun of this, the people.
[00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:30.620]   These are...
[00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:37.300]   This is now by the way...
[00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:44.300]   This is by the way, you got to give credit to Jerry Seinfeld for his breakthrough podcast
[00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:47.020]   Comedians and Cars Getting Coffee.
[00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:53.100]   But even before that, you got to give credit to a good friend of the show.
[00:28:53.100 --> 00:29:00.780]   Bobby Llewellyn, who plays the rubber-faced robot on Red Dwarf, Criton.
[00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:01.780]   Because Bobby used to do...
[00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:03.620]   In fact, I was even in Bobby's podcast.
[00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:07.900]   He'd go around the country in his electric car, pick up people and interview them in the
[00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:08.900]   car.
[00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:12.700]   And he discovered, and I think it was quite right, that there's something about people
[00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:18.740]   when they're driving in a car together, they're just more relaxed.
[00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:23.380]   And so Robert Llewellyn's got... was really the guy who invented this whole thing.
[00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:27.340]   He didn't sing, but he should get some credit for inventing this.
[00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:32.060]   But let's go back to the Planet of the Apps, which no one can argue is the best name for
[00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:33.660]   a television show ever.
[00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:38.100]   Oh, you're going to argue with me, huh?
[00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:41.700]   Well, if you care about app developers...
[00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:43.580]   Well, it's a reality show.
[00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:49.020]   Actually, that's my biggest problem with it, is this is going to completely misrepresent
[00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:53.340]   the thrill of being an app developer.
[00:29:53.340 --> 00:30:01.660]   The hosts, the judges of this will be Gwyneth Paltrow, because she has a child named Apple.
[00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:03.260]   Will I Am?
[00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:06.420]   Because he once was famous as a rap artist.
[00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:10.700]   And get this Gary Vaynerchuk.
[00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:12.580]   Who is he?
[00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:18.860]   You don't know who Gary V is, but he is a podcaster.
[00:30:18.860 --> 00:30:20.340]   Best known.
[00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:25.620]   For Wine Library TV, good friend known Gary for many ever since he started doing this.
[00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:34.260]   Gary was a wine seller who created a podcast about wine, but then turned it into a massive
[00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:43.340]   book deal and a huge business helping people do digital media.
[00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:44.340]   Written, he's written.
[00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:48.300]   He has a class on how to develop your personal brand.
[00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:49.820]   How did we live without that?
[00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:51.020]   And he's the king of it.
[00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:52.020]   Let me tell you.
[00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:55.020]   That's why we had all immediately heard of him.
[00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:56.980]   Yeah, Gary, who?
[00:30:56.980 --> 00:30:59.620]   Nobody knows who he is.
[00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:00.620]   Isn't that funny?
[00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:01.620]   Yeah.
[00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:04.100]   He's the clown I showed up at my Facebook feed.
[00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:05.100]   Yeah, that's what he is.
[00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:06.100]   Yeah.
[00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:07.100]   Well, I do know him.
[00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:09.860]   And I think this is where I think I have a problem.
[00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:12.820]   You were asking me, what is the problem with Apple?
[00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:14.340]   Not the lightning port.
[00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:18.660]   This kind of stupidity of building a TV show around apps.
[00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:22.700]   It's like what somebody needs to make friends in Hollywood.
[00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:25.700]   And so we should do that exactly what is this.
[00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:27.180]   This is just such nonsense.
[00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:32.620]   They should be building better products and not stupid TV shows around your products.
[00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:40.020]   It's like, if you want to do something for the shareholders, make interesting damn MacBooks
[00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:41.500]   which people can buy.
[00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:46.060]   You want to do something nice, make a better phone which people want to keep buying.
[00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:48.140]   Nobody cares if you do Planet of the Apps.
[00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:54.700]   This is coming from the so-called celebrity influx into the company, whether it is through
[00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:57.300]   the Beats acquisition or ADQ.
[00:31:57.300 --> 00:31:59.540]   I mean, it's like you look at ADQ.
[00:31:59.540 --> 00:32:04.100]   The guy was hanging out at the playoffs when iCloud was burning for six hours.
[00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:07.100]   You know, he wouldn't have survived a day if Steve was around.
[00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:08.100]   I'm sorry.
[00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:13.300]   That's what gets me worked about this, worked up about this company is that they have all
[00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:14.620]   these wrong priorities.
[00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:19.900]   They want to do entertainment content, buy damn Netflix and move on from there.
[00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:22.500]   Do it properly if you want to do it.
[00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:28.860]   Don't try and do this stupid, penny anti stuff which adds no value to the company.
[00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:30.300]   Absolutely none.
[00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:31.300]   And I'm sorry.
[00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:34.700]   Like this is where I see this company going wrong.
[00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:36.820]   I agree 100% preach.
[00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:38.940]   I agree too.
[00:32:38.940 --> 00:32:41.700]   And to me it feels a little bit like Jimmy Iovine.
[00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:45.500]   Well, it's ADQ, Jimmy Iovine.
[00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:47.340]   It's the Hollywood connection.
[00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:51.580]   And I think you know, you could Apple would say, well, but it's part of a strategic plan
[00:32:51.580 --> 00:32:56.820]   for us to make Apple TV more valuable.
[00:32:56.820 --> 00:33:00.140]   Well, clearly Apple sees its future in services, right?
[00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:06.620]   Because they're starting to make money there as the other as the hardware declines, frankly.
[00:33:06.620 --> 00:33:10.180]   The services is starting to become a multi-billion dollar business.
[00:33:10.180 --> 00:33:17.460]   So what they see themselves as I would guess I'm just kind of looking at them is some sort
[00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:20.980]   of content slash services company.
[00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:24.820]   I think that's a different story.
[00:33:24.820 --> 00:33:26.980]   I think that's a different angle.
[00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:31.860]   Panel of the apps, how about building a search engine which works more effectively?
[00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:33.460]   How about building an editorial?
[00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:34.460]   Excited.
[00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:35.460]   Like which exactly?
[00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:39.860]   I just think just focusing on all these wrong things is the problem.
[00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:44.060]   I think that's the bigger issue with the company than anything else.
[00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:50.660]   You need better, you know, better computing intelligence to make a better shopping experience
[00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:54.700]   for people on the app store, not planet of the apps.
[00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:55.700]   I don't care.
[00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:58.580]   Like do I give a shit about Gweneth Paltrow and her taste?
[00:33:58.580 --> 00:34:00.300]   I don't, right?
[00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:06.220]   That's an old way of thinking about this, you know, about how people discover things
[00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:07.660]   and how people do things.
[00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:13.860]   I think this company just desperately needs a fresh, you know, fresh infusion of thinking.
[00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:19.580]   There just is really old school way of thinking, you know, whether I'm not a big fan of this
[00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:25.940]   whole Jimmy, kind of thinking that we will do this, hand-coded playlist and we'll do
[00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:29.500]   this which is all going to be done by hand and artists.
[00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:35.100]   All those things are nice, but in the end they just need to build systems of tomorrow
[00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:38.140]   and not, you know, keep doing things of today.
[00:34:38.140 --> 00:34:43.820]   Like I really think this is a big challenge for the company and nobody seems to kind of,
[00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:46.220]   you know, call them out on it anymore.
[00:34:46.220 --> 00:34:47.220]   I couldn't agree more.
[00:34:47.220 --> 00:34:48.420]   Let's, I want to take a break.
[00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:51.820]   And when we come back, let's talk about the challenge that not just Apple, but all tech
[00:34:51.820 --> 00:34:58.540]   companies face of a stagnation of the business cycle, which seems to be accelerated.
[00:34:58.540 --> 00:35:00.220]   What does Apple do?
[00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:02.260]   How does Apple stay relevant?
[00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:04.460]   How do they find new markets?
[00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:05.780]   Everybody's dealing with this.
[00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:07.300]   Google's doing it.
[00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:11.300]   Microsoft has reinvented itself.
[00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:12.780]   I think this is a fascinating subject.
[00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:17.940]   We got a great panel to do at David Corsi is here from nowhere.
[00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:19.220]   He's just Corsi.com.
[00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:22.580]   He has nothing to plug, nothing to sell.
[00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:23.580]   He's just nowhere.
[00:35:23.580 --> 00:35:24.580]   It's Bill.
[00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:26.380]   He's in a, he's in Tracy.
[00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:28.940]   That's where he is.
[00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:33.780]   But we love him and he brings a unique perspective to the, to the, to the party absolutely as
[00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:40.180]   does Om Malek, giga Om founder at now at om.co and P.co.
[00:35:40.180 --> 00:35:42.100]   See if I see P.co, that's not right.
[00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:43.100]   Pi.co.
[00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:44.100]   It's called Pico.
[00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:47.700]   Yeah, I know, but you got to put a dot in there, man.
[00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:48.700]   Yeah, it's not.
[00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:49.700]   Oh, is it Om Co?
[00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:50.700]   Om.co.
[00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:51.700]   Om.co.
[00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:52.700]   P.co.
[00:35:52.700 --> 00:35:53.700]   P.co.
[00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:54.700]   P.I.
[00:35:54.700 --> 00:35:55.700]   Dot co.
[00:35:55.700 --> 00:35:56.700]   Okay.
[00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:57.700]   Well, hi dot co.
[00:35:57.700 --> 00:35:58.700]   Pi dot co.
[00:35:58.700 --> 00:35:59.700]   But it's pronounced Pico.
[00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:00.700]   You see the problem.
[00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:01.700]   You see the problem here.
[00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:02.700]   Yeah.
[00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:04.700]   I love it.
[00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:05.700]   I love it.
[00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:07.340]   He owns the co registry apparently.
[00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:11.060]   It's all from now on all co all the way down.
[00:36:11.060 --> 00:36:16.300]   And Philip Elmer DeWitt, who has no, has left the trades.
[00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:21.900]   He's no longer an inked stained retches now part of the digital world at PED 30 dot com
[00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:23.540]   is new Apple three dot o sites.
[00:36:23.540 --> 00:36:25.460]   Great to have all three of you.
[00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:27.300]   We will continue the conversation in a moment.
[00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:30.820]   But first a word from our sponsor, Wealthfront.
[00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:31.900]   You all face this issue.
[00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:32.900]   We all do.
[00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:39.820]   We got to save for long term long term savings for the retirement for the kids college fund
[00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:41.060]   for that house down payment.
[00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:42.060]   You got to be saving money.
[00:36:42.060 --> 00:36:44.100]   But what are you going to do with how are you going to save you going to throw it in
[00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:45.100]   a mattress?
[00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:46.100]   No.
[00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:47.100]   You want to bank savings account?
[00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:48.100]   Come on.
[00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:49.380]   Really get real.
[00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:51.180]   You need growth.
[00:36:51.180 --> 00:36:52.340]   How are you going to do it?
[00:36:52.340 --> 00:36:55.780]   Well, a lot of people invest.
[00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:57.900]   There's a lot of growth here, but there's also a lot of work there.
[00:36:57.900 --> 00:36:59.300]   You got to pay attention to your invest.
[00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:01.980]   Also, maybe you hire a broker.
[00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:05.540]   They cost between one and three percent of what they manage every single year, not to
[00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:11.780]   mention secret hidden transaction fees and half the time they're making money on the side
[00:37:11.780 --> 00:37:15.460]   because they're selling you something there and they're getting a commission for.
[00:37:15.460 --> 00:37:16.460]   That's not it.
[00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:19.620]   Let me tell you, computers have changed everything.
[00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:24.740]   I know that the brokerages are scared of Wealthfront because I see articles all the
[00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:25.740]   time.
[00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:29.580]   Wealthfront doesn't charge you one, two or three percent of the money under management.
[00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:35.340]   They charge one quarter of one percent a year, 25 basis points less than anybody in zero
[00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:37.540]   commissions, no hidden fees.
[00:37:37.540 --> 00:37:41.180]   That's because computers, the computer is doing all the work for you.
[00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:43.180]   The computer has another advantage.
[00:37:43.180 --> 00:37:48.540]   You can constantly monitor your investment, rebalance your portfolio, do sophisticated
[00:37:48.540 --> 00:37:54.420]   things like tax loss harvesting all on your behalf at a very low cost.
[00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:57.340]   Now, of course, computer programs got to be well written.
[00:37:57.340 --> 00:38:01.820]   Well, look at the people who are behind this, some of the smartest people.
[00:38:01.820 --> 00:38:05.820]   They went out and they got an advisory board of people like Burton Malkiel who wrote kind
[00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:11.740]   of the book, the Random Walk on down Wall Street, Charles D. Ellis, or another classic.
[00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:20.940]   You've got between them 200 years of combined investment experience, seven PhDs, Nobel Prize-winning
[00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:27.340]   academic research, the best investment practices, and it does a great job.
[00:38:27.340 --> 00:38:28.860]   That's really what matters.
[00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:32.380]   I'll tell you what, if you want to find out more, you don't have to invest right away.
[00:38:32.380 --> 00:38:33.540]   They've got some free services.
[00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:36.340]   You can try at wealthfront.com/twit.
[00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:41.100]   Answer a few simple questions about your time frame, your risk aversion, and they will generate
[00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:42.300]   a sample portfolio.
[00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:43.620]   That's yours to keep.
[00:38:43.620 --> 00:38:53.020]   You can also take your current portfolio and your current investments, put them in there,
[00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:57.380]   and they'll give you some idea of how well diversified it is, how much risk it is, what
[00:38:57.380 --> 00:39:02.300]   you're losing to fees, how you can minimize your taxes on your current stuff.
[00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:08.020]   Wealthfront.com, they just introduced their 529 college savings plan too, which is really
[00:39:08.020 --> 00:39:13.540]   great, it's like a Roth IRA for higher education expenses for your kids, your grandkids.
[00:39:13.540 --> 00:39:18.220]   Wealthfront's growing fast, more than $3 billion in client assets under management.
[00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:22.820]   Many of you Twit fans have been trying it, and I get emails all the time, people who love
[00:39:22.820 --> 00:39:23.820]   it.
[00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:25.340]   Go there right now, find out more.
[00:39:25.340 --> 00:39:29.300]   The minimum investment is just $500, so it's easy to dip your toe in.
[00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:33.940]   But listen to this, if you do decide to invest with Wealthfront, your first $15,000 will
[00:39:33.940 --> 00:39:38.980]   be managed, not for one, two, or three percent a year, not even for one quarter of one percent
[00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:43.220]   a year, but for nothing free forever for life.
[00:39:43.220 --> 00:39:45.820]   Great way to start your nest egg.
[00:39:45.820 --> 00:39:48.340]   Wealthfront.com/Twit.
[00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:53.420]   It is really a great solution.
[00:39:53.420 --> 00:39:57.260]   We're talking about Apple right now, we'll move on and talk about some other topics, but
[00:39:57.260 --> 00:40:01.700]   really this is a topic that all of the mature tech companies are facing today is how do
[00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:04.260]   you continue to innovate?
[00:40:04.260 --> 00:40:05.260]   It's the innovators dilemma.
[00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:07.180]   We've known about it for years.
[00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:11.620]   Isn't that all Apple's trying to do is find the next big thing?
[00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:16.460]   And shouldn't they be praised for going beyond thinking, "Well, it's just the next computer
[00:40:16.460 --> 00:40:20.660]   or the next phone or the next iPad or the next do-hickey?
[00:40:20.660 --> 00:40:22.620]   Maybe our future is in services."
[00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:25.540]   Isn't that what Microsoft decided?
[00:40:25.540 --> 00:40:31.980]   I'm not funny enough that I'm writing a piece about this for the New Yorker, hopefully tomorrow
[00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:33.980]   or day after it will go out.
[00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:38.500]   But what I'm talking about is essentially, if you look at the top five companies by market
[00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:47.060]   cap right now, they are Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Facebook.
[00:40:47.060 --> 00:40:50.500]   That's like five largest companies by market cap.
[00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:56.100]   So what stock market is saying that they believe in the potential of these companies, they
[00:40:56.100 --> 00:41:03.220]   believe in the growth these companies will have, actually despite their mega sizes, with
[00:41:03.220 --> 00:41:11.180]   the exception of Apple, which is having a down year, you see the other Google, Amazon,
[00:41:11.180 --> 00:41:16.980]   and Facebook are having high double digit growth in their most recent quarter both in revenue
[00:41:16.980 --> 00:41:20.380]   terms and from a profit standpoint too.
[00:41:20.380 --> 00:41:25.500]   So there is much less of an issue around these companies.
[00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:31.420]   The reason I was actually talking about Apple trying to need to focus and need to focus
[00:41:31.420 --> 00:41:37.700]   more on using data and being smart about where their opportunities are instead of doing things
[00:41:37.700 --> 00:41:42.540]   like Planet of the Apps is from that standpoint.
[00:41:42.540 --> 00:41:49.780]   I think these companies have mega platforms like Apple also has, like Apple has services
[00:41:49.780 --> 00:41:52.180]   business, which is growing really, really fast.
[00:41:52.180 --> 00:41:55.540]   It's almost six billion dollars a quarter business now.
[00:41:55.540 --> 00:42:01.060]   So they have a lot of opportunities to capture, but they need to be focused on whether they
[00:42:01.060 --> 00:42:03.020]   are going to capture those opportunities.
[00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:09.540]   Google, you think people will not search less, they will search less next year or the year
[00:42:09.540 --> 00:42:13.900]   after or they'll look for less information next year, probably not.
[00:42:13.900 --> 00:42:18.260]   Will people be less social next year?
[00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:19.260]   Probably not.
[00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:25.260]   Facebook, Google, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, none of these companies get less valuable.
[00:42:25.260 --> 00:42:32.220]   I think their big growth curve is actually in front of them as long as they are focused.
[00:42:32.220 --> 00:42:37.020]   And I think this is why companies like Apple need to get more focused.
[00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:42.060]   Microsoft has decided to focus on cloud and cloud related services and you're going to
[00:42:42.060 --> 00:42:48.580]   start to see them transition their old enterprise businesses on to a zone and make money off
[00:42:48.580 --> 00:42:49.580]   it.
[00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:54.060]   They're taking productivity and turning it into like, how does the world work in the
[00:42:54.060 --> 00:42:55.060]   future?
[00:42:55.060 --> 00:42:58.460]   So they have clearly figured out what's the way forward?
[00:42:58.460 --> 00:43:03.140]   Like it might take them some time to get there, but they're moving in the right direction.
[00:43:03.140 --> 00:43:08.940]   So you start to see these big five companies have a lot of growth ahead of them as long
[00:43:08.940 --> 00:43:12.540]   as they're not distracted by penny anti stuff.
[00:43:12.540 --> 00:43:15.220]   That's my analysis of the situation.
[00:43:15.220 --> 00:43:20.420]   I would disagree in one respect, there is a significant difference to Microsoft and Apple
[00:43:20.420 --> 00:43:29.420]   and Google, Facebook and Amazon, the other member of the five horsemen of the apocalypse
[00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:35.420]   is that Apple and Microsoft have significant strong competition.
[00:43:35.420 --> 00:43:39.100]   You could argue that Android is actually stronger than iPhone.
[00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:40.900]   I think it's pretty clear.
[00:43:40.900 --> 00:43:43.700]   Facebook has no competition.
[00:43:43.700 --> 00:43:47.660]   Google has very little, very little competition.
[00:43:47.660 --> 00:43:50.300]   Amazon just ate the competition.
[00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:52.780]   So that's a significant difference.
[00:43:52.780 --> 00:43:55.260]   Apple's in a tougher, much tougher position, aren't they?
[00:43:55.260 --> 00:43:58.300]   I mean, you don't have to buy a computer or phone or a tablet from Apple.
[00:43:58.300 --> 00:44:01.300]   There are plenty of good alternatives.
[00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:02.300]   But once you do.
[00:44:02.300 --> 00:44:04.500]   And their services suck.
[00:44:04.500 --> 00:44:08.220]   And yet they got 15 million people paying for Apple music.
[00:44:08.220 --> 00:44:09.580]   How much longer?
[00:44:09.580 --> 00:44:10.580]   That's the question.
[00:44:10.580 --> 00:44:11.580]   You never know.
[00:44:11.580 --> 00:44:15.180]   Like a year in a year they have 15 million people.
[00:44:15.180 --> 00:44:19.220]   It took Spotify five years to get to 35 million.
[00:44:19.220 --> 00:44:20.220]   Just think about that.
[00:44:20.220 --> 00:44:21.220]   Like so they have a lot.
[00:44:21.220 --> 00:44:22.940]   Well, the music landscape is different too.
[00:44:22.940 --> 00:44:26.780]   And this may be why Apple is sucking up to Hollywood.
[00:44:26.780 --> 00:44:31.100]   Spotify only survives because the music industry allows it to.
[00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:34.700]   And Spotify's only revenue stream is from subscriptions.
[00:44:34.700 --> 00:44:37.300]   Apple can afford to lose money on Apple music.
[00:44:37.300 --> 00:44:39.500]   It's not their main business.
[00:44:39.500 --> 00:44:43.780]   They get a piece of the cut from Spotify too.
[00:44:43.780 --> 00:44:44.940]   Because they're behind it.
[00:44:44.940 --> 00:44:47.020]   So Spotify doesn't like that much.
[00:44:47.020 --> 00:44:48.020]   Yeah.
[00:44:48.020 --> 00:44:53.900]   I mean, I think there is a lot more opportunity for Apple if this company decided it needed
[00:44:53.900 --> 00:44:56.340]   to zero in on services.
[00:44:56.340 --> 00:44:58.660]   More effectively, Apple Pay is a great business.
[00:44:58.660 --> 00:45:00.540]   I think it's going to do really well.
[00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:07.540]   I think you have to stop thinking of Apple just from a hardware perspective.
[00:45:07.540 --> 00:45:10.860]   You have to think of them from a services perspective.
[00:45:10.860 --> 00:45:16.300]   I mean, if I was them, I am seriously thinking about maybe we should buy Netflix.
[00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:17.300]   Right?
[00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:21.620]   Like that adds a big services component to their business.
[00:45:21.620 --> 00:45:27.060]   It's a big acquisition, but they have the stock and the money to make this happen.
[00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:33.420]   Like and they have like it also fits into their bigger agenda of like having iTunes
[00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:38.820]   like another entity which can create a lot of revenue for them.
[00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:45.300]   So I think the most important thing is they need to be kind of looking at how do you make
[00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:49.020]   acquisitions which are like, you know, more than 300 million dollars?
[00:45:49.020 --> 00:45:53.060]   How do they figure out what are the new things people will keep buying from them?
[00:45:53.060 --> 00:45:54.500]   And what are the new services?
[00:45:54.500 --> 00:45:59.540]   And if they can't build those services, how do you bring those services in house by buying
[00:45:59.540 --> 00:46:01.420]   other people like Netflix?
[00:46:01.420 --> 00:46:08.460]   I think they need to build up their big data and internet chops which they don't so that,
[00:46:08.460 --> 00:46:11.620]   you know, iCloud doesn't kill or whatever you ever saw often.
[00:46:11.620 --> 00:46:13.900]   So they have to do all those things.
[00:46:13.900 --> 00:46:15.540]   You know what they don't want to do?
[00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:18.940]   The planet of the apps.
[00:46:18.940 --> 00:46:20.180]   Can I weigh in here?
[00:46:20.180 --> 00:46:22.380]   Please, Philip, this is your beat.
[00:46:22.380 --> 00:46:25.500]   There's a lot that I have a lot to say about what I'm going to say.
[00:46:25.500 --> 00:46:28.260]   Would you short Apple if you were an investor right now?
[00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:29.260]   No.
[00:46:29.260 --> 00:46:31.380]   No, no, no, no.
[00:46:31.380 --> 00:46:36.220]   Well, you know, it's gone up 10% in the last two weeks.
[00:46:36.220 --> 00:46:41.500]   There were analysts telling their clients to sell Apple two weeks ago and they've got
[00:46:41.500 --> 00:46:44.300]   a lot of mud on their face right now.
[00:46:44.300 --> 00:46:48.540]   The services I think is a bit of a distraction.
[00:46:48.540 --> 00:46:56.740]   Apple, in my opinion, will remain a hardware company primarily and services is in support
[00:46:56.740 --> 00:46:58.140]   of the hardware.
[00:46:58.140 --> 00:47:04.540]   It's part of the wall garden that keeps people in and they have to be competitive in services,
[00:47:04.540 --> 00:47:09.820]   but they don't have to make money at it and they don't actually have to be the best.
[00:47:09.820 --> 00:47:13.980]   I think Apple is looking at what the...
[00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:16.780]   I believe they're making a car.
[00:47:16.780 --> 00:47:24.620]   I know Jason Calcanis last week floated the rumor that Apple is not building a car.
[00:47:24.620 --> 00:47:27.700]   They're just going to go and make the software.
[00:47:27.700 --> 00:47:35.220]   It felt like disinformation to me.
[00:47:35.220 --> 00:47:41.460]   And if you think of Apple as the company that made a lot of money on computers and phones
[00:47:41.460 --> 00:47:48.660]   and is working on a car that will probably do what the others did, which is skim off
[00:47:48.660 --> 00:47:56.460]   the most profitable part of every market it enters and have a great business, a great
[00:47:56.460 --> 00:48:04.500]   profitable business as opposed to say Android, nobody makes money making Android machines.
[00:48:04.500 --> 00:48:08.980]   And Samsung had a great core.
[00:48:08.980 --> 00:48:10.700]   They have...
[00:48:10.700 --> 00:48:11.700]   But then they'll have...
[00:48:11.700 --> 00:48:17.020]   Because they come out with that phone in the quarter when Apple doesn't have any phone
[00:48:17.020 --> 00:48:18.780]   and then Apple leapfrogs.
[00:48:18.780 --> 00:48:24.340]   It happens so many years in a row you can kind of count on it.
[00:48:24.340 --> 00:48:28.220]   And looking at the other companies, I think what...
[00:48:28.220 --> 00:48:33.780]   People may continue to search Google, but I think Google has a structural problem in
[00:48:33.780 --> 00:48:41.260]   that most of its revenue comes from the US and Europe and most of the growth of the internet
[00:48:41.260 --> 00:48:45.740]   is in Asia and Africa and places that don't...
[00:48:45.740 --> 00:48:46.980]   People don't spend a lot of money on Google.
[00:48:46.980 --> 00:48:49.100]   Google does have competition in China.
[00:48:49.100 --> 00:48:51.020]   There's serious competition from Biden.
[00:48:51.020 --> 00:48:53.580]   Well, they don't even really exist in China.
[00:48:53.580 --> 00:49:04.180]   So, right now you can look at Google as it's funding the growth of the internet from the
[00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:08.300]   revenue that it's getting from its richest customers.
[00:49:08.300 --> 00:49:13.980]   But the growth that it's funding is in places where revenue doesn't grow.
[00:49:13.980 --> 00:49:20.380]   If you step back far enough, you can start seeing sort of clouds on Google's horizon.
[00:49:20.380 --> 00:49:29.740]   Amazon is an amazing machine, but it's from a stock market perspective, it's way overpriced.
[00:49:29.740 --> 00:49:35.260]   And if it doesn't deliver the growth that it's promised, there are going to be a lot
[00:49:35.260 --> 00:49:37.380]   of sad investors.
[00:49:37.380 --> 00:49:38.540]   Who else do we have?
[00:49:38.540 --> 00:49:39.540]   There's Facebook.
[00:49:39.540 --> 00:49:40.540]   Facebook's strong.
[00:49:40.540 --> 00:49:42.580]   You've got to love Facebook, right?
[00:49:42.580 --> 00:49:51.300]   Well, yeah, but Facebook has a lot of the elements of a fad.
[00:49:51.300 --> 00:49:54.900]   And people are very fickle in social media.
[00:49:54.900 --> 00:50:00.580]   Doesn't Facebook feel like it's making the right moves though to kind of transcend that?
[00:50:00.580 --> 00:50:01.580]   Who's going to come on?
[00:50:01.580 --> 00:50:06.140]   When you have a billion and a half customers, there's no my space coming along to steal
[00:50:06.140 --> 00:50:07.140]   that.
[00:50:07.140 --> 00:50:10.860]   Well, I don't know what's going on in China, but I wouldn't be surprised if the next big
[00:50:10.860 --> 00:50:13.580]   social media doesn't come from the US.
[00:50:13.580 --> 00:50:18.060]   Maybe, but I don't see Americans using it.
[00:50:18.060 --> 00:50:19.060]   You know, we'll see.
[00:50:19.060 --> 00:50:20.060]   I don't know.
[00:50:20.060 --> 00:50:21.060]   Nobody's using a tweet chat here.
[00:50:21.060 --> 00:50:24.060]   Everybody uses a tweet chat in China, but nobody's using it here.
[00:50:24.060 --> 00:50:25.060]   Yeah.
[00:50:25.060 --> 00:50:28.580]   I'm just saying there's this natural network effect with these kinds of things, right?
[00:50:28.580 --> 00:50:32.140]   Yeah, but there's also a little bit of a hula hoop effect.
[00:50:32.140 --> 00:50:34.140]   So we'll see.
[00:50:34.140 --> 00:50:37.380]   You heard it here first, ladies and gentlemen, Philip Elman with says Facebook, it's just
[00:50:37.380 --> 00:50:38.940]   a fad.
[00:50:38.940 --> 00:50:41.980]   It's just a fad, kids.
[00:50:41.980 --> 00:50:45.980]   And it's also making a ton of money on advertising on mobile.
[00:50:45.980 --> 00:50:49.260]   It's shown that it can handle mobile, right?
[00:50:49.260 --> 00:50:55.900]   And I'm a little wary of the advertising model as the way it turned the internet.
[00:50:55.900 --> 00:50:56.900]   Interesting.
[00:50:56.900 --> 00:51:00.620]   We've talked about this before.
[00:51:00.620 --> 00:51:04.300]   My eyes have been trained not to look at ads on the screen.
[00:51:04.300 --> 00:51:05.980]   Well, that's what banner ads are.
[00:51:05.980 --> 00:51:07.580]   Banner ads are not the future, I agree.
[00:51:07.580 --> 00:51:08.580]   Yeah.
[00:51:08.580 --> 00:51:09.580]   There's all kinds of advertising.
[00:51:09.580 --> 00:51:11.180]   I agree with the other, the other things.
[00:51:11.180 --> 00:51:12.180]   The other things.
[00:51:12.180 --> 00:51:17.340]   When you look at Instagram, a Facebook company, and you scroll through the great pictures from
[00:51:17.340 --> 00:51:23.100]   Om Malek and Chris Michael and all so many great pictures and then every 10th image is
[00:51:23.100 --> 00:51:26.340]   an ad that you're not really sure it's an ad right away.
[00:51:26.340 --> 00:51:32.580]   And I have, I have literally bought stuff in Instagram ads because I went, Oh, I like
[00:51:32.580 --> 00:51:33.580]   that.
[00:51:33.580 --> 00:51:36.260]   I think that's a very effective platform.
[00:51:36.260 --> 00:51:37.740]   Much more so than a banner ad.
[00:51:37.740 --> 00:51:38.740]   Go ahead Om.
[00:51:38.740 --> 00:51:42.660]   I think I disagree with Philip.
[00:51:42.660 --> 00:51:51.660]   I think Facebook is going to be less of a, it's going to be a growth engine for a long
[00:51:51.660 --> 00:51:52.660]   time.
[00:51:52.660 --> 00:51:57.220]   They're just beginning to start to monetize messenger.
[00:51:57.220 --> 00:52:00.060]   I think payments are a big part of their future.
[00:52:00.060 --> 00:52:02.420]   Commerce is a big part of their future.
[00:52:02.420 --> 00:52:09.900]   I mean, they have a lot of opportunity going forward and to think of them as a fad is wrong
[00:52:09.900 --> 00:52:10.900]   in my opinion.
[00:52:10.900 --> 00:52:19.620]   I think you're underselling Mark Zuckerberg who is perhaps the single best CEO in tech
[00:52:19.620 --> 00:52:20.620]   right now.
[00:52:20.620 --> 00:52:24.180]   That's what you look at to me is you look at a Jeff Bezos or Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:52:24.180 --> 00:52:25.180]   Yeah.
[00:52:25.180 --> 00:52:28.140]   And you place a bet on them versus say, Tim Cook, to be honest.
[00:52:28.140 --> 00:52:34.380]   When you look at Google, Google has so many data streams and they have the compute power
[00:52:34.380 --> 00:52:41.340]   and the brain power to mash up all those data streams and build the future of home, build
[00:52:41.340 --> 00:52:47.940]   the future of connected car, build the future of advertising, build the future of information,
[00:52:47.940 --> 00:52:53.780]   retrieval, all those things that are pretty fairly uniquely positioned company.
[00:52:53.780 --> 00:52:58.460]   They still need to figure out what are the revenue streams of the future.
[00:52:58.460 --> 00:53:03.420]   But from a technology standpoint, they have a lot of things going for them.
[00:53:03.420 --> 00:53:05.340]   I think same goes for Amazon.
[00:53:05.340 --> 00:53:08.740]   Amazon is the infrastructure of modern society.
[00:53:08.740 --> 00:53:14.100]   Whether you look at their cloud services or their e-commerce services, they are sucking
[00:53:14.100 --> 00:53:18.660]   the middle in a retail drive by their operations.
[00:53:18.660 --> 00:53:26.020]   So Microsoft may not be in the best of conditions right now, but they're on the right track.
[00:53:26.020 --> 00:53:33.580]   I think the Apple too, I am mixed on Apple for one simple reason that they're starting
[00:53:33.580 --> 00:53:35.900]   to do a lot of foolish things.
[00:53:35.900 --> 00:53:39.340]   But as a platform, they are very strong.
[00:53:39.340 --> 00:53:40.980]   As a brand, they're very strong.
[00:53:40.980 --> 00:53:45.700]   They still make more money for app developers than Android does.
[00:53:45.700 --> 00:53:48.380]   And they make a lot of great products.
[00:53:48.380 --> 00:53:54.420]   And I think in all reality, they too have a future.
[00:53:54.420 --> 00:54:00.220]   If they can do services, they can bring in resources into the company which can skew
[00:54:00.220 --> 00:54:08.220]   them into forward thinking areas which involves software and data and infrastructure capabilities.
[00:54:08.220 --> 00:54:13.020]   So I don't think these five actually have a lot going for them.
[00:54:13.020 --> 00:54:15.260]   Who else do you see out there?
[00:54:15.260 --> 00:54:24.540]   Do you think Oracle is going to be the driver of the future or IBM or ExxonMobil or Monsanto?
[00:54:24.540 --> 00:54:25.860]   I don't think so.
[00:54:25.860 --> 00:54:30.420]   You have companies like the five big tech companies.
[00:54:30.420 --> 00:54:32.300]   More importantly, they have scale.
[00:54:32.300 --> 00:54:33.620]   They build their own hardware.
[00:54:33.620 --> 00:54:35.980]   They can hire whoever they want.
[00:54:35.980 --> 00:54:43.420]   They have so much cash that they actually skew the salary situation in Silicon Valley
[00:54:43.420 --> 00:54:45.260]   to their own advantage.
[00:54:45.260 --> 00:54:48.220]   I mean, they have a lot going for them.
[00:54:48.220 --> 00:54:52.140]   The big five are the big five and they're going to get bigger and bigger at least for
[00:54:52.140 --> 00:54:54.020]   near foreseeable future.
[00:54:54.020 --> 00:54:56.460]   I mean, I'm not talking from a stock standpoint.
[00:54:56.460 --> 00:55:00.140]   I'm just talking from who is their competition.
[00:55:00.140 --> 00:55:08.980]   We talk about big data and artificial intelligence and forget how much of that depends on compute
[00:55:08.980 --> 00:55:09.980]   power.
[00:55:09.980 --> 00:55:16.700]   That depends on ability to get multiple data streams from multiple different sources to
[00:55:16.700 --> 00:55:18.700]   make sense of.
[00:55:18.700 --> 00:55:23.500]   I think there is a lot which these companies can do, which other people their competitors
[00:55:23.500 --> 00:55:24.660]   can't do.
[00:55:24.660 --> 00:55:31.380]   You're starting to see some of the middle level networking companies can't find scale
[00:55:31.380 --> 00:55:36.300]   anymore because people like Facebook decide they want to build their own switches and
[00:55:36.300 --> 00:55:38.140]   then open source them.
[00:55:38.140 --> 00:55:44.060]   Now, Taiwanese can make those switches and the software is open server.
[00:55:44.060 --> 00:55:53.420]   There is a big change which is happening in the way things are.
[00:55:53.420 --> 00:55:57.660]   I would actually look at these five and just say, "Wow, there is something bigger going
[00:55:57.660 --> 00:55:58.660]   on here."
[00:55:58.660 --> 00:56:05.180]   Would you add a sixth if you had a Tesla Solar City, maybe Tesla Solar City SpaceX?
[00:56:05.180 --> 00:56:12.780]   I don't know how SpaceX comes into play, but Tesla and Solar City definitely have the
[00:56:12.780 --> 00:56:17.420]   potential of becoming a bigger, the new energy platform.
[00:56:17.420 --> 00:56:24.260]   Again, this is somebody Elon Musk who like a Jeff Bezos or Mark Zuckerberg has a broader
[00:56:24.260 --> 00:56:30.260]   longer term vision and seemingly a plan.
[00:56:30.260 --> 00:56:32.020]   David, you're silent on all this.
[00:56:32.020 --> 00:56:34.540]   You got a theory, an opinion?
[00:56:34.540 --> 00:56:35.540]   He doesn't have a mic.
[00:56:35.540 --> 00:56:36.540]   That's why he's not talking.
[00:56:36.540 --> 00:56:37.540]   Oh, no.
[00:56:37.540 --> 00:56:38.540]   I have a mic.
[00:56:38.540 --> 00:56:39.540]   I'm here.
[00:56:39.540 --> 00:56:40.540]   Oh, good.
[00:56:40.540 --> 00:56:41.540]   Okay.
[00:56:41.540 --> 00:56:47.500]   Well, listening to all my have to say I'm violently in agreement, but we need to, the
[00:56:47.500 --> 00:56:52.060]   industry that we grew up in, we're here as technology people.
[00:56:52.060 --> 00:56:58.660]   And now we're talking about Apple's retail strategy and Apple's automotive strategy.
[00:56:58.660 --> 00:57:02.140]   And at some point, I wonder, what do we really know about this?
[00:57:02.140 --> 00:57:03.140]   Who are we?
[00:57:03.140 --> 00:57:04.860]   It's never stopped us before, David.
[00:57:04.860 --> 00:57:05.860]   Now, come on.
[00:57:05.860 --> 00:57:09.940]   I understand, but if Apple is getting into the celebrity thing, I have to remind them
[00:57:09.940 --> 00:57:13.900]   that Marissa Mayer did so well with that at Yahoo!
[00:57:13.900 --> 00:57:16.620]   She's going to end up at Apple next.
[00:57:16.620 --> 00:57:17.620]   That would make good sense.
[00:57:17.620 --> 00:57:18.620]   Okay.
[00:57:18.620 --> 00:57:21.860]   You're talking about Katie Couric and Katie and even some of them.
[00:57:21.860 --> 00:57:27.340]   But she was continuing in the, in the Terry Semmel, her predecessor was a Hollywood guy.
[00:57:27.340 --> 00:57:29.940]   So she was just kind of following along in his footsteps.
[00:57:29.940 --> 00:57:33.860]   Well, okay, and $7 million parties and stuff.
[00:57:33.860 --> 00:57:35.780]   I'm just saying that the world has changed.
[00:57:35.780 --> 00:57:37.620]   The audience has changed.
[00:57:37.620 --> 00:57:40.420]   You know, the audience is now everyone.
[00:57:40.420 --> 00:57:41.420]   Well, I agree.
[00:57:41.420 --> 00:57:44.700]   And we're talking about really massive companies now, all of a sudden.
[00:57:44.700 --> 00:57:46.900]   Yes, indeed.
[00:57:46.900 --> 00:57:50.060]   And Apple doesn't have to be just a hardware company.
[00:57:50.060 --> 00:57:55.420]   Hardware is probably not enough to keep Apple going in the future.
[00:57:55.420 --> 00:57:59.740]   It's going to be different sorts of businesses than what we've grown up with.
[00:57:59.740 --> 00:58:04.300]   We have the benefit of knowing what's happened up until this date.
[00:58:04.300 --> 00:58:08.140]   But it's not clear to me that we know exactly what's going to happen in the future.
[00:58:08.140 --> 00:58:13.420]   Are that anybody does, except that it's going to be very broad based.
[00:58:13.420 --> 00:58:19.580]   It's going to be at, you know, whatever you call the general public or the, whatever the
[00:58:19.580 --> 00:58:25.900]   audience is going to be, it's going to not be, you know, three and a half or what three
[00:58:25.900 --> 00:58:29.940]   white guys in home sitting around talking about what's going to happen with that.
[00:58:29.940 --> 00:58:30.940]   Are you a half?
[00:58:30.940 --> 00:58:34.940]   And two and a half in here.
[00:58:34.940 --> 00:58:42.740]   No, yeah, I think you make an excellent point, David, that where once we could talk about
[00:58:42.740 --> 00:58:49.740]   PCs and speeds and feeds and gigahertz versus megahertz, now we're covering a much broader
[00:58:49.740 --> 00:58:54.180]   field that is even ventured into the non-tech area.
[00:58:54.180 --> 00:58:55.540]   Let's get his mass appeal now.
[00:58:55.540 --> 00:58:56.540]   It's mass market.
[00:58:56.540 --> 00:58:59.780]   Well, there's lots of science that shows up on what used to be tech blogs.
[00:58:59.780 --> 00:59:00.780]   Right.
[00:59:00.780 --> 00:59:02.900]   You know, volcanoes and space flight.
[00:59:02.900 --> 00:59:08.340]   And you're thinking, gee, we must have run out of stuff to talk about technology.
[00:59:08.340 --> 00:59:10.140]   You're not going to hear about volcanoes on this show.
[00:59:10.140 --> 00:59:14.660]   I could tell you a little hot air maybe, but no lava.
[00:59:14.660 --> 00:59:15.660]   That is pretty good.
[00:59:15.660 --> 00:59:19.180]   But I, let's, let's point, Lina, let's talk about Apple, right?
[00:59:19.180 --> 00:59:26.140]   At things Apple does, which nobody else does really well, they still make world's best
[00:59:26.140 --> 00:59:28.380]   mobile chips, right?
[00:59:28.380 --> 00:59:34.180]   Like, and because they have so much money that they can hire people, engineers, semiconductor
[00:59:34.180 --> 00:59:41.340]   engineers to build new kind of silicon to not only make their phones slimmer and slimmer,
[00:59:41.340 --> 00:59:43.780]   but also do some crazy things, right?
[00:59:43.780 --> 00:59:50.180]   Similarly, they hire some of the best material science people to build new kind of alloys
[00:59:50.180 --> 00:59:54.620]   for their phones and for their watches and computers.
[00:59:54.620 --> 00:59:59.860]   So those are, they do so much deep tech, which we don't see.
[00:59:59.860 --> 01:00:04.820]   And nobody talks about same is with Google and Facebook and Microsoft.
[01:00:04.820 --> 01:00:10.860]   George Gilder pointed this out decades ago with microcosm that we, the economies of scale
[01:00:10.860 --> 01:00:17.300]   really start kicking in in the chip business and so forth.
[01:00:17.300 --> 01:00:23.100]   But it also, it's so innovations happening, but it takes leadership to know which directions
[01:00:23.100 --> 01:00:24.420]   to innovate in.
[01:00:24.420 --> 01:00:28.380]   It's not enough merely to buy PA risk and hire a thousand chip designers.
[01:00:28.380 --> 01:00:30.660]   You have to then point them in the right direction.
[01:00:30.660 --> 01:00:36.100]   I mean, and I just think that is not going to go away from the Apple core because that's
[01:00:36.100 --> 01:00:41.580]   the thing which makes them great and that's what they will keep focusing on.
[01:00:41.580 --> 01:00:47.100]   Like again, I keep harking back on this, these ideas of like not doing core stuff,
[01:00:47.100 --> 01:00:52.100]   which is like core stuff is doing, you know, better chips and better materials and better
[01:00:52.100 --> 01:00:57.020]   phones and generating more demand with great ads and not through.
[01:00:57.020 --> 01:00:58.540]   It's a leadership issue though, right?
[01:00:58.540 --> 01:00:59.540]   Yeah.
[01:00:59.540 --> 01:01:00.620]   No, I think Tim Cook is fine.
[01:01:00.620 --> 01:01:06.940]   I think he's a fine, fine CEO, but he needs more people who understand internet around
[01:01:06.940 --> 01:01:07.940]   him.
[01:01:07.940 --> 01:01:12.500]   I think there is a lack of internet understanding in that company.
[01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:15.140]   There is a lot of DNA in hardware.
[01:01:15.140 --> 01:01:20.100]   They need more software, you know, software from an internet perspective, not software
[01:01:20.100 --> 01:01:22.660]   from a desktop or a Noah's perspective.
[01:01:22.660 --> 01:01:24.940]   They have ample capabilities in that.
[01:01:24.940 --> 01:01:30.980]   What they don't have is the ability to think about like, you know, the internet and big
[01:01:30.980 --> 01:01:35.340]   data and intelligence in a smart, modern way.
[01:01:35.340 --> 01:01:38.500]   I think that's what they need to be focused on.
[01:01:38.500 --> 01:01:44.700]   Let's talk about that because that's been the not when it was clear that Google was
[01:01:44.700 --> 01:01:52.780]   sort of doubling down on AI and Microsoft and Amazon both talked up their AI efforts
[01:01:52.780 --> 01:01:58.740]   and they clearly have a lot of strength in terms of the massive amounts of data they're
[01:01:58.740 --> 01:02:05.220]   collecting and the kind of control they have over extracting stuff from it.
[01:02:05.220 --> 01:02:11.140]   It put pressure on Apple to step up.
[01:02:11.140 --> 01:02:14.780]   And I don't know what to think about.
[01:02:14.780 --> 01:02:21.620]   Tim Cook saying, you know, we've been doing advanced AI for years.
[01:02:21.620 --> 01:02:23.100]   Yeah, maybe.
[01:02:23.100 --> 01:02:27.100]   I mean, Siri clearly needs AI to work.
[01:02:27.100 --> 01:02:31.620]   The series, their example of advanced AI, they got a long way to go.
[01:02:31.620 --> 01:02:34.820]   Yeah, it's a laggard in that area.
[01:02:34.820 --> 01:02:35.820]   Yeah.
[01:02:35.820 --> 01:02:36.820]   Hey, Siri.
[01:02:36.820 --> 01:02:37.820]   Hey, Siri.
[01:02:37.820 --> 01:02:40.020]   Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, you, Siri.
[01:02:40.020 --> 01:02:41.020]   I'm good.
[01:02:41.020 --> 01:02:42.020]   Yeah.
[01:02:42.020 --> 01:02:50.700]   So, and, you know, now that just this week they've bought, reportedly spent $200 million
[01:02:50.700 --> 01:02:51.700]   buying, Siri.
[01:02:51.700 --> 01:02:52.700]   Yeah.
[01:02:52.700 --> 01:02:56.780]   What was funny about that for me is that I went to try to find out what tour is about
[01:02:56.780 --> 01:02:59.980]   and I watched some video.
[01:02:59.980 --> 01:03:03.860]   They give conferences every year so you can find it exactly what they're about.
[01:03:03.860 --> 01:03:07.340]   And the last conference that this guy, what's his name?
[01:03:07.340 --> 01:03:10.780]   Carlos Grestren gave.
[01:03:10.780 --> 01:03:17.260]   He had a graphic that showed all the ways that machine intelligence, machine learning
[01:03:17.260 --> 01:03:18.620]   is affecting all these companies.
[01:03:18.620 --> 01:03:21.660]   And it had basically everybody in Silicon Valley, but Apple.
[01:03:21.660 --> 01:03:24.860]   And then Apple is the one that buys them.
[01:03:24.860 --> 01:03:31.100]   So, you know, the, the, by the way, they bought them at a premium price, right?
[01:03:31.100 --> 01:03:35.740]   It's widely agreed that's $200 million is, is a premium.
[01:03:35.740 --> 01:03:36.740]   Is that widely agreed?
[01:03:36.740 --> 01:03:37.740]   Yeah.
[01:03:37.740 --> 01:03:38.740]   I don't know.
[01:03:38.740 --> 01:03:42.500]   A lot of people said, big payday for turi, I think was.
[01:03:42.500 --> 01:03:43.500]   Yeah.
[01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:44.500]   Well, of course.
[01:03:44.500 --> 01:03:45.780]   Yeah, when you get bought by Apple.
[01:03:45.780 --> 01:03:46.780]   Yeah.
[01:03:46.780 --> 01:03:47.780]   Yeah.
[01:03:47.780 --> 01:03:51.820]   The again, I see them as a hardware company.
[01:03:51.820 --> 01:03:53.660]   I think Oh, Oh, I was right.
[01:03:53.660 --> 01:04:02.500]   They have a weak spot because knowing how to map the internet and take advantage of
[01:04:02.500 --> 01:04:07.300]   it and be a player there is not doesn't seem to be in their DNA.
[01:04:07.300 --> 01:04:15.300]   It wasn't in jobs is and it's not where the smartest people and the best engineers at
[01:04:15.300 --> 01:04:18.540]   Apple go to how they get rewarded.
[01:04:18.540 --> 01:04:24.340]   Their, their interests don't align with being great at that.
[01:04:24.340 --> 01:04:27.300]   I think because they're a hardware company.

[01:09:19.220 --> 01:09:20.220]   I'm going to love them.

[01:09:24.220 --> 01:09:25.220]   I'm going to love them.
[01:09:25.220 --> 01:09:26.220]   I'm going to love them.
[01:09:26.220 --> 01:09:27.220]   I'm going to love them.
[01:09:27.220 --> 01:09:28.220]   I'm going to love them.
[01:09:28.220 --> 01:09:29.220]   I'm going to love them.
[01:09:29.220 --> 01:09:30.220]   I'm going to love them.
[01:09:30.220 --> 01:09:31.220]   I'm going to love them.
[01:09:31.220 --> 01:09:32.220]   I'm going to love them.
[01:09:32.220 --> 01:09:33.220]   I'm going to love them.
[01:09:33.220 --> 01:09:39.220]   I'm going to love them.
[01:09:39.220 --> 01:09:40.220]   I'm going to love them.
[01:09:40.220 --> 01:09:41.220]   I'm going to love them.
[01:09:41.220 --> 01:09:42.220]   I'm going to love them.
[01:09:42.220 --> 01:09:43.220]   I'm going to love them.
[01:09:43.220 --> 01:09:44.220]   I'm going to love them.
[01:09:44.220 --> 01:09:45.220]   I'm going to love them.
[01:09:45.220 --> 01:09:46.220]   I'm going to love them.
[01:09:46.220 --> 01:09:47.220]   I'm going to love them.
[01:09:47.220 --> 01:09:48.220]   I'm going to love them.
[01:09:48.220 --> 01:09:49.220]   I'm going to love them.
[01:09:49.220 --> 01:09:50.220]   I'm going to love them.
[01:09:50.220 --> 01:09:51.220]   I'm going to love them.
[01:09:51.220 --> 01:09:52.220]   I'm going to love them.
[01:09:52.220 --> 01:09:53.220]   I'm going to love them.
[01:09:53.220 --> 01:09:54.220]   I'm going to love them.
[01:09:54.220 --> 01:09:55.220]   I'm going to love them.
[01:09:55.220 --> 01:09:56.220]   I'm going to love them.
[01:09:56.220 --> 01:09:57.220]   I'm going to love them.
[01:09:57.220 --> 01:09:58.220]   I'm going to love them.
[01:09:58.220 --> 01:09:59.220]   I'm going to love them.
[01:09:59.220 --> 01:10:00.220]   I'm going to love them.
[01:10:00.220 --> 01:10:01.220]   I'm going to love them.
[01:10:01.220 --> 01:10:02.220]   I'm going to love them.
[01:10:02.220 --> 01:10:03.220]   I'm going to love them.
[01:10:03.220 --> 01:10:04.220]   I'm going to love them.
[01:10:04.220 --> 01:10:05.220]   I'm going to love them.
[01:10:05.220 --> 01:10:06.220]   I'm going to love them.
[01:10:06.220 --> 01:10:07.220]   I'm going to love them.
[01:10:07.220 --> 01:10:08.220]   I'm going to love them.
[01:10:08.220 --> 01:10:09.220]   I'm going to love them.
[01:10:09.220 --> 01:10:10.220]   I'm going to love them.
[01:10:10.220 --> 01:10:11.220]   I'm going to love them.
[01:10:11.220 --> 01:10:12.220]   I'm going to love them.
[01:10:12.220 --> 01:10:13.220]   I'm going to love them.
[01:10:13.220 --> 01:10:14.220]   I'm going to love them.
[01:10:14.220 --> 01:10:15.220]   I'm going to love them.
[01:10:15.220 --> 01:10:16.220]   I'm going to love them.
[01:10:16.220 --> 01:10:17.220]   I'm going to love them.
[01:10:17.220 --> 01:10:18.220]   I'm going to love them.
[01:10:18.220 --> 01:10:19.220]   I'm going to love them.
[01:10:19.220 --> 01:10:20.220]   I'm going to love them.
[01:10:20.220 --> 01:10:21.220]   I'm going to love them.
[01:10:21.220 --> 01:10:22.220]   I'm going to love them.
[01:10:22.220 --> 01:10:23.220]   I'm going to love them.
[01:10:23.220 --> 01:10:24.220]   I'm going to love them.
[01:10:24.220 --> 01:10:25.220]   I'm going to love them.
[01:10:25.220 --> 01:10:26.220]   I'm going to love them.
[01:10:26.220 --> 01:10:33.220]   Mark Lor, you may remember founded diapers.com in 2005.
[01:10:33.220 --> 01:10:41.220]   Amazon undercut them, practically put them out of business and bought the company.
[01:10:41.220 --> 01:10:45.220]   Mark Lor had a decent payday, went on and he's now founded Jet.com.
[01:10:45.220 --> 01:10:52.220]   According to the Wall Street Journal, Walmart's about to buy him $43 billion.
[01:10:52.220 --> 01:10:58.220]   If anybody could challenge Jeff Bezos and Amazon, it's got to be Walmart.
[01:10:58.220 --> 01:11:01.220]   Yes?
[01:11:01.220 --> 01:11:04.220]   Who wants to take this one?
[01:11:04.220 --> 01:11:06.220]   Nobody.
[01:11:06.220 --> 01:11:08.220]   That's all yours, Leo.
[01:11:08.220 --> 01:11:09.220]   You got it.
[01:11:09.220 --> 01:11:10.220]   You got it.
[01:11:10.220 --> 01:11:13.220]   Mark, though, he's come up with a brilliant strategy, which is create an Amazon competitor.
[01:11:13.220 --> 01:11:18.220]   Let Amazon practically put you out of business because I don't think Jet.com was going anywhere.
[01:11:18.220 --> 01:11:20.220]   Let's be honest.
[01:11:20.220 --> 01:11:22.220]   I don't even know what they did.
[01:11:22.220 --> 01:11:23.220]   Oh, see?
[01:11:23.220 --> 01:11:24.220]   There you go.
[01:11:24.220 --> 01:11:25.220]   Perfect example.
[01:11:25.220 --> 01:11:27.220]   They were an Amazon competitor.
[01:11:27.220 --> 01:11:32.220]   Well, that story says they're picking up 350,000 customers a month.
[01:11:32.220 --> 01:11:34.220]   If that's the case, you really are.
[01:11:34.220 --> 01:11:36.220]   I find that hard to believe.
[01:11:36.220 --> 01:11:38.220]   Well, it's buy them and kill them.
[01:11:38.220 --> 01:11:47.220]   They are subsumed, assimilated into the greater Amazon being washed downstream, never to be
[01:11:47.220 --> 01:11:48.220]   seen again.
[01:11:48.220 --> 01:11:50.220]   I tried Jet.com.
[01:11:50.220 --> 01:11:52.220]   You had to join, I think.
[01:11:52.220 --> 01:11:54.220]   You had to pay kind of like Prime, I guess.
[01:11:54.220 --> 01:11:56.220]   You've seen the ads maybe.
[01:11:56.220 --> 01:12:01.220]   Obviously, you haven't filled up where they had the price shrinking gun.
[01:12:01.220 --> 01:12:03.220]   See, this was a terrible story.
[01:12:03.220 --> 01:12:05.220]   The whole thing just was...
[01:12:05.220 --> 01:12:08.220]   The promise Amazon, this is what I'm saying, has no competition.
[01:12:08.220 --> 01:12:10.220]   Maybe your local grocery store.
[01:12:10.220 --> 01:12:11.220]   But with...
[01:12:11.220 --> 01:12:13.220]   Maybe Walmart, right?
[01:12:13.220 --> 01:12:16.220]   Because Walmart doesn't need to build more fulfillment centers.
[01:12:16.220 --> 01:12:19.220]   They've got Wal-Mart's everywhere and warehouses everywhere.
[01:12:19.220 --> 01:12:23.220]   They could even offer same-day delivery in many areas.
[01:12:23.220 --> 01:12:25.220]   So I'm not...
[01:12:25.220 --> 01:12:29.220]   I'm $3 billion to a company that has hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue every year
[01:12:29.220 --> 01:12:32.220]   is probably a small amount of money.
[01:12:32.220 --> 01:12:39.220]   I have a hard time not seeing Amazon as kind of a malevolent force.
[01:12:39.220 --> 01:12:43.220]   It's kind of hollowed out a lot of downtown areas.
[01:12:43.220 --> 01:12:45.220]   There's no bookstores left.
[01:12:45.220 --> 01:12:48.220]   It's just the first.
[01:12:48.220 --> 01:12:54.220]   One industry after another, they've kind of gobbled up.
[01:12:54.220 --> 01:13:02.220]   It turns out where they're making their money is in the big data centers they built.
[01:13:02.220 --> 01:13:04.220]   It's almost...
[01:13:04.220 --> 01:13:07.220]   Oh, yeah, the S3 and Amazon Web Services.
[01:13:07.220 --> 01:13:08.220]   Yeah.
[01:13:08.220 --> 01:13:12.220]   It was really Walmart that cleared out small town downtown
[01:13:12.220 --> 01:13:14.220]   before there ever was in Amazon.
[01:13:14.220 --> 01:13:15.220]   True.
[01:13:15.220 --> 01:13:17.220]   So Walmart has cleared that out.
[01:13:17.220 --> 01:13:20.220]   They've also cleared out a whole bunch of jobs.
[01:13:20.220 --> 01:13:24.220]   Amazon showed up and cleared out the bookstores.
[01:13:24.220 --> 01:13:28.220]   And between them now, they're clearing out...
[01:13:28.220 --> 01:13:30.220]   Shocking everything left.
[01:13:30.220 --> 01:13:31.220]   Everything.
[01:13:31.220 --> 01:13:36.220]   Everything that does not require a human to help you is going to be in deep trouble.
[01:13:36.220 --> 01:13:38.220]   Amazon is hyper-competitive.
[01:13:38.220 --> 01:13:41.220]   I mean, obviously, with their book deals, with the publishers,
[01:13:41.220 --> 01:13:46.220]   they've really ground the publishers into dust.
[01:13:46.220 --> 01:13:50.220]   Now they're leasing 40 cargo jets.
[01:13:50.220 --> 01:13:53.220]   Amazon Prime Air.
[01:13:53.220 --> 01:13:59.220]   And I have to imagine that some of this is to continue to get prices from UPS
[01:13:59.220 --> 01:14:01.220]   and FedEx to drop.
[01:14:01.220 --> 01:14:02.220]   Amazon...
[01:14:02.220 --> 01:14:05.220]   There's a great book about Amazon, which...
[01:14:05.220 --> 01:14:06.220]   I'm trying to remember the name of it.
[01:14:06.220 --> 01:14:07.220]   It was a one-thing store.
[01:14:07.220 --> 01:14:08.220]   The Everything Store.
[01:14:08.220 --> 01:14:09.220]   The Everything Store.
[01:14:09.220 --> 01:14:10.220]   Fabulous book.
[01:14:10.220 --> 01:14:12.220]   They talk about this.
[01:14:12.220 --> 01:14:14.220]   UPS said, "We're going to raise the rates."
[01:14:14.220 --> 01:14:16.220]   Jeff Bezos said, "Really?"
[01:14:16.220 --> 01:14:17.220]   And...
[01:14:17.220 --> 01:14:20.220]   Can I just make one comment about Amazon?
[01:14:20.220 --> 01:14:21.220]   Yeah.
[01:14:21.220 --> 01:14:26.220]   You guys were talking about them making all their money from their...
[01:14:26.220 --> 01:14:27.220]   Services.
[01:14:27.220 --> 01:14:28.220]   Yeah.
[01:14:28.220 --> 01:14:29.220]   Cloud Services.
[01:14:29.220 --> 01:14:31.220]   Actually, that's not true.
[01:14:31.220 --> 01:14:36.220]   They're non-AWS businesses, which is non-Amazon web services.
[01:14:36.220 --> 01:14:44.220]   Revenues in the last quarter grew 29%, which was up 26% a quarter before.
[01:14:44.220 --> 01:14:45.220]   Wow.
[01:14:45.220 --> 01:14:49.220]   And it was up 19% in Q4 or 2015.
[01:14:49.220 --> 01:14:52.220]   And Prime Day, that was the best day ever, right?
[01:14:52.220 --> 01:14:53.220]   So they had their best day ever.
[01:14:53.220 --> 01:14:54.220]   Yeah.
[01:14:54.220 --> 01:14:55.220]   That's the revenue.
[01:14:55.220 --> 01:14:56.220]   That's the revenue.
[01:14:56.220 --> 01:14:58.220]   But Jeff has a dial in his office.
[01:14:58.220 --> 01:14:59.220]   It says profit.
[01:14:59.220 --> 01:15:00.220]   Let's turn it up.
[01:15:00.220 --> 01:15:01.220]   Let's turn it down.
[01:15:01.220 --> 01:15:03.220]   Let me just stop you right there.
[01:15:03.220 --> 01:15:14.220]   Last, their non-AWS EVITA was $1.2 billion in the most recent quarter, versus $684 million
[01:15:14.220 --> 01:15:15.220]   a year ago.
[01:15:15.220 --> 01:15:17.220]   But that pays us his decision.
[01:15:17.220 --> 01:15:20.220]   They decide whether to reinvest or not.
[01:15:20.220 --> 01:15:22.220]   They invest in new things.
[01:15:22.220 --> 01:15:24.220]   They are smart about investing in new things.
[01:15:24.220 --> 01:15:26.220]   I don't want them to make money.
[01:15:26.220 --> 01:15:27.220]   That's why...
[01:15:27.220 --> 01:15:31.220]   By the way, I don't understand what we are talking about here.
[01:15:31.220 --> 01:15:39.220]   This is a company with almost $30 billion in revenue, which grew 31%.
[01:15:39.220 --> 01:15:44.620]   I mean, in this last three months, for God's sake, their third-party sales, third-party,
[01:15:44.620 --> 01:15:47.900]   which has got nothing to do with what they are selling.
[01:15:47.900 --> 01:15:49.900]   This is people selling on the Amazon platform.
[01:15:49.900 --> 01:15:51.940]   Using their fulfillment in effect.
[01:15:51.940 --> 01:15:55.220]   That business was up almost 40%.
[01:15:55.220 --> 01:15:56.220]   Okay.
[01:15:56.220 --> 01:15:57.220]   So it is...
[01:15:57.220 --> 01:15:58.220]   But doesn't that scare you?
[01:15:58.220 --> 01:15:59.220]   I mean, oh, no.
[01:15:59.220 --> 01:16:05.860]   I'm just saying we keep talking about AWS and how much AWS is making money for them.
[01:16:05.860 --> 01:16:06.860]   Actually, that's just...
[01:16:06.860 --> 01:16:07.860]   Is a myth.
[01:16:07.860 --> 01:16:12.980]   They actually make a lot of revenues from their non-AWS businesses.
[01:16:12.980 --> 01:16:17.460]   And they actually have a lot of profit margin in there.
[01:16:17.460 --> 01:16:21.220]   They choose to spend their profits on new opportunities.
[01:16:21.220 --> 01:16:22.220]   Jets.
[01:16:22.220 --> 01:16:26.220]   Well, AWS, I guess the interesting thing about AWS is it came out of nowhere.
[01:16:26.220 --> 01:16:30.020]   We got all these as computers, we should probably do something with them.
[01:16:30.020 --> 01:16:35.900]   And they built the strongest cloud service platform, besting everybody, including Oracle,
[01:16:35.900 --> 01:16:36.900]   Microsoft and Google.
[01:16:36.900 --> 01:16:42.900]   They're taking market in that sector.
[01:16:42.900 --> 01:16:49.580]   They're sucking up the dollars from the Oracle's, from the HP's, from the mid-year companies.
[01:16:49.580 --> 01:16:51.140]   Not from...
[01:16:51.140 --> 01:16:52.700]   This is a new way of doing things.
[01:16:52.700 --> 01:16:59.700]   I mean, you can choose to like them or dislike them, but what they are doing is building
[01:16:59.700 --> 01:17:05.140]   out a really interesting business, which is very strong.
[01:17:05.140 --> 01:17:06.540]   It's like they're logistics.
[01:17:06.540 --> 01:17:08.660]   They are a logistics company.
[01:17:08.660 --> 01:17:15.980]   They do logistics for data and bits, and they do logistics for atoms.
[01:17:15.980 --> 01:17:16.980]   That's what they do.
[01:17:16.980 --> 01:17:23.060]   They are essentially a logistics company, and they are spending a ton of money on making
[01:17:23.060 --> 01:17:25.260]   those logistics be better.
[01:17:25.260 --> 01:17:27.100]   They have fulfillment centers.
[01:17:27.100 --> 01:17:28.940]   They have their own Air Force.
[01:17:28.940 --> 01:17:31.700]   4767s, they're leased.
[01:17:31.700 --> 01:17:35.100]   But that's the smart way to do it, of course, not the buy act.
[01:17:35.100 --> 01:17:36.100]   The whole...
[01:17:36.100 --> 01:17:41.300]   You and I talked about them as a company a long time ago.
[01:17:41.300 --> 01:17:49.740]   I obsess about Amazon not from a commerce standpoint, but as a macro company standpoint.
[01:17:49.740 --> 01:17:52.020]   Well, I like it that they're a logistics company.
[01:17:52.020 --> 01:17:53.820]   That kind of makes sense.
[01:17:53.820 --> 01:17:58.340]   If you really think about it, what they are doing, and I wrote about this on Pico in a
[01:17:58.340 --> 01:18:06.820]   conversation with one of my people I interviewed, Liam Casey, I think we all like to think
[01:18:06.820 --> 01:18:14.700]   of the commerce and retail in the old terms in which goods come, they sit on the dry
[01:18:14.700 --> 01:18:19.660]   docks, they can go to warehouses, they sit in warehouses, then they go to distribution
[01:18:19.660 --> 01:18:24.060]   centers, and from there they go into the corner stores.
[01:18:24.060 --> 01:18:29.540]   What Amazon is doing is building an end-to-end, always moving supply chain.
[01:18:29.540 --> 01:18:30.980]   So, you are never...
[01:18:30.980 --> 01:18:37.060]   You're squeezing out every single inefficiency out of the logistics chain and then making
[01:18:37.060 --> 01:18:40.740]   that work for you from a profit standpoint.
[01:18:40.740 --> 01:18:48.900]   So when being a guy at Walmart and ZDOT-Con talk about merging, that's an interesting
[01:18:48.900 --> 01:18:51.820]   idea, that's an interesting band aid.
[01:18:51.820 --> 01:18:57.340]   But what they have to do is think about how these guys are thinking end-to-end, same-day
[01:18:57.340 --> 01:19:02.380]   delivery, so that you don't even have to think about going to your neighborhood retail
[01:19:02.380 --> 01:19:03.900]   store.
[01:19:03.900 --> 01:19:09.460]   And that is only possible when the goods are constantly moving in the supply chain.
[01:19:09.460 --> 01:19:10.820]   And how do you do that?
[01:19:10.820 --> 01:19:14.980]   By building the most awesome kick-ass logistics chain in the world.
[01:19:14.980 --> 01:19:17.380]   And that's what these guys are trying to do.
[01:19:17.380 --> 01:19:24.340]   I mean, in the audacity of Amazon is what I am most impressed by.
[01:19:24.340 --> 01:19:25.340]   Am I scared by them?
[01:19:25.340 --> 01:19:30.260]   Of course, I'm scared of every big company controlling every part of our life.
[01:19:30.260 --> 01:19:42.180]   I don't even, for one second, do I think twice about Amazon as a giant monster which
[01:19:42.180 --> 01:19:45.260]   is going to gobble up everything?
[01:19:45.260 --> 01:19:46.500]   They will.
[01:19:46.500 --> 01:19:48.260]   So, that's it.
[01:19:48.260 --> 01:19:49.500]   So we agree.
[01:19:49.500 --> 01:19:57.420]   I'm very only in the sense that there's a limit, once there's no competition, Amazon
[01:19:57.420 --> 01:19:59.420]   just eats the world.
[01:19:59.420 --> 01:20:00.420]   Right?
[01:20:00.420 --> 01:20:02.860]   I mean, who needs the corner store anyway?
[01:20:02.860 --> 01:20:05.260]   And by the way, I'm all in on Amazon.
[01:20:05.260 --> 01:20:06.580]   I buy everything from Amazon.
[01:20:06.580 --> 01:20:09.740]   I just bought a giant TV.
[01:20:09.740 --> 01:20:14.660]   And that doesn't make any sense to ship that across the country, but I bought it on Amazon
[01:20:14.660 --> 01:20:17.540]   instead of going down to the local electronics store.
[01:20:17.540 --> 01:20:22.100]   By the way, I don't even think there is a Best Buy in town anymore.
[01:20:22.100 --> 01:20:24.500]   So is that good?
[01:20:24.500 --> 01:20:27.100]   That's not good for consumers, but maybe it is.
[01:20:27.100 --> 01:20:28.100]   I don't know.
[01:20:28.100 --> 01:20:29.100]   I'm happy.
[01:20:29.100 --> 01:20:33.300]   I mean, I'm just saying that they will eventually make money and that and they will make money.
[01:20:33.300 --> 01:20:37.460]   And they make as much money as they want to make is what they're doing right now.
[01:20:37.460 --> 01:20:41.700]   So it's just a different place for them to be.
[01:20:41.700 --> 01:20:43.460]   Yeah.
[01:20:43.460 --> 01:20:45.500]   And now they have an air fleet.
[01:20:45.500 --> 01:20:49.740]   Do we think they're really going to deliver by drones?
[01:20:49.740 --> 01:20:50.740]   No.
[01:20:50.740 --> 01:20:52.380]   They're trying it out in England.
[01:20:52.380 --> 01:20:54.060]   And they've got the green light.
[01:20:54.060 --> 01:20:55.580]   You know where it's interesting?
[01:20:55.580 --> 01:21:00.740]   The drone, there is value in drone delivery, not in the first world.
[01:21:00.740 --> 01:21:05.660]   But for instance, when Haiti had that terrible earthquake and they couldn't get, there were
[01:21:05.660 --> 01:21:12.500]   lots of places that you couldn't get medicines into and other important commodities.
[01:21:12.500 --> 01:21:14.500]   Drone delivery was the only way.
[01:21:14.500 --> 01:21:16.020]   You couldn't get a truck over the roads.
[01:21:16.020 --> 01:21:17.020]   They were able to do that.
[01:21:17.020 --> 01:21:21.580]   And I suspect that's really more the future of drone delivery than just bringing it down
[01:21:21.580 --> 01:21:25.260]   my street here and dropping it on my doorstep.
[01:21:25.260 --> 01:21:26.900]   Why do that even?
[01:21:26.900 --> 01:21:29.260]   So why promoted?
[01:21:29.260 --> 01:21:31.220]   Why did they unveil the drone?
[01:21:31.220 --> 01:21:32.220]   Why was that 60 minutes?
[01:21:32.220 --> 01:21:36.100]   And he had to have something interesting to say.
[01:21:36.100 --> 01:21:43.380]   I think the big thing about pet companies and their stock market valuation is you have
[01:21:43.380 --> 01:21:46.820]   to promise people or show people what's coming next.
[01:21:46.820 --> 01:21:50.260]   You don't get a price to earning ratio of $3,500.
[01:21:50.260 --> 01:21:54.180]   But I'm not showing something cool once in a while.
[01:21:54.180 --> 01:21:58.300]   I mean, why is Facebook talking about Oculus all the time?
[01:21:58.300 --> 01:22:02.700]   That thing isn't putting anything into their bottom line for a very long time.
[01:22:02.700 --> 01:22:03.700]   If ever.
[01:22:03.700 --> 01:22:04.700]   Right?
[01:22:04.700 --> 01:22:05.700]   Right?
[01:22:05.700 --> 01:22:11.540]   So it's all like, or Google doing things with like, you know, diabetes related contact lenses
[01:22:11.540 --> 01:22:15.300]   and, you know, connected car, all those things are in the future.
[01:22:15.300 --> 01:22:19.180]   The reason they're doing this is because what else would you do with your money?
[01:22:19.180 --> 01:22:22.380]   Give it back to the shareholders like Apple is doing.
[01:22:22.380 --> 01:22:25.940]   I don't make that makes no sense.
[01:22:25.940 --> 01:22:28.260]   Well, Apple's keeping most of it in Ireland, really.
[01:22:28.260 --> 01:22:29.740]   Also, they're giving a lot.
[01:22:29.740 --> 01:22:30.740]   They're doing the share buybacks.
[01:22:30.740 --> 01:22:31.740]   The buybacks are good.
[01:22:31.740 --> 01:22:35.020]   Yeah, but that because that gives them more control of their destiny, doesn't it?
[01:22:35.020 --> 01:22:36.020]   Isn't that the point?
[01:22:36.020 --> 01:22:37.020]   Yeah.
[01:22:37.020 --> 01:22:38.700]   I think that is a nice way of saying it.
[01:22:38.700 --> 01:22:40.780]   The other company we did a lot of buybacks.
[01:22:40.780 --> 01:22:42.460]   IBM, look where they are.
[01:22:42.460 --> 01:22:43.460]   Yeah.
[01:22:43.460 --> 01:22:45.420]   But buybacks are not necessarily a good thing.
[01:22:45.420 --> 01:22:51.020]   I think part of it is that they pay their employees in stock and they have to keep the
[01:22:51.020 --> 01:22:58.580]   buybacks are enabled is allowing the PE ratio to at least stay even in this downturn.
[01:22:58.580 --> 01:23:03.940]   By the way, Amazon's PE ratio, which was 3,500 when they did that 60 minutes interview,
[01:23:03.940 --> 01:23:08.820]   is down to a mere 190.
[01:23:08.820 --> 01:23:11.740]   So I don't know what that means.
[01:23:11.740 --> 01:23:12.740]   He turned the dial.
[01:23:12.740 --> 01:23:15.740]   I swear to God, he's got a knob.
[01:23:15.740 --> 01:23:17.940]   How much profit should we have this quarter, Jeff?
[01:23:17.940 --> 01:23:18.940]   I don't know.
[01:23:18.940 --> 01:23:22.340]   Let's set it to 10 percent right there.
[01:23:22.340 --> 01:23:25.180]   And this is not a cranky geek version of the show.
[01:23:25.180 --> 01:23:27.540]   You guys are not cranky now at all.
[01:23:27.540 --> 01:23:28.940]   David is quiet.
[01:23:28.940 --> 01:23:29.940]   David, get cranky.
[01:23:29.940 --> 01:23:30.940]   I don't know.
[01:23:30.940 --> 01:23:33.700]   It's been pretty cranky.
[01:23:33.700 --> 01:23:38.260]   I think I feel like I'm the only one playing by the...
[01:23:38.260 --> 01:23:39.260]   No, I'm not.
[01:23:39.260 --> 01:23:40.500]   I'm Mr. Affable.
[01:23:40.500 --> 01:23:42.300]   They told me I have to be affable.
[01:23:42.300 --> 01:23:43.300]   What's wrong with you, Leo?
[01:23:43.300 --> 01:23:45.700]   I'm not going to come on the show next to you.
[01:23:45.700 --> 01:23:46.700]   Oh, gosh.
[01:23:46.700 --> 01:23:47.700]   Oh, I got to get cranky.
[01:23:47.700 --> 01:23:49.500]   Got to get cranky.
[01:23:49.500 --> 01:23:52.580]   I am betting the brunt of crankiness right now.
[01:23:52.580 --> 01:23:54.620]   I'll think of something to be upset about.
[01:23:54.620 --> 01:23:56.580]   Let's talk about the Olympics for just a second.
[01:23:56.580 --> 01:23:57.780]   Oh, that'll get us cranky.
[01:23:57.780 --> 01:23:58.780]   Hold on.
[01:23:58.780 --> 01:23:59.780]   Calm cast.
[01:23:59.780 --> 01:24:00.780]   Hold on.
[01:24:00.780 --> 01:24:01.780]   Hold on.
[01:24:01.780 --> 01:24:02.780]   Oh, calm cast.
[01:24:02.780 --> 01:24:03.780]   There we can get really cranky.
[01:24:03.780 --> 01:24:04.780]   I can get cranky.
[01:24:04.780 --> 01:24:05.780]   We can get cranky.
[01:24:05.780 --> 01:24:06.860]   Save this up waiting for...
[01:24:06.860 --> 01:24:07.860]   Save your crank.
[01:24:07.860 --> 01:24:08.860]   We will have a cranky moment.
[01:24:08.860 --> 01:24:10.860]   What do you mean by that?
[01:24:10.860 --> 01:24:12.460]   Save up all the crank.
[01:24:12.460 --> 01:24:13.460]   Save up all the crank.
[01:24:13.460 --> 01:24:14.460]   No, it is not.
[01:24:14.460 --> 01:24:16.860]   I was going to say the feds are coming through the door.
[01:24:16.860 --> 01:24:21.000]   Save your crankiness and we will be back with more in just a moment.
[01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:22.000]   Great panel.
[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:23.600]   I know I build them as cranky.
[01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:24.940]   They're too nice.
[01:24:24.940 --> 01:24:25.940]   Philip Elmer-Dewitt.
[01:24:25.940 --> 01:24:26.940]   Oh, Malek.
[01:24:26.940 --> 01:24:29.580]   He's the only cranky one in the bunch.
[01:24:29.580 --> 01:24:34.480]   And David Corsi, who's crankiness, is yet to come.
[01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:38.140]   If you mention the word "comcast," I might get cranky too.
[01:24:38.140 --> 01:24:39.140]   Calm cast.
[01:24:39.140 --> 01:24:42.920]   Ah, slowly I turn.
[01:24:42.920 --> 01:24:44.080]   Inch by inch.
[01:24:44.080 --> 01:24:45.520]   Step by step.
[01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:47.820]   Our show is brought to you by Stamps.com.
[01:24:47.820 --> 01:24:49.220]   I'll tell you this is something that makes me happy.
[01:24:49.220 --> 01:24:51.080]   You know what makes me cranky going to the post office?
[01:24:51.080 --> 01:24:52.280]   That's a cranky thing.
[01:24:52.280 --> 01:24:54.880]   To get postage, that's crazy too.
[01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:58.120]   Why do that when you could do everything you do at the post office?
[01:24:58.120 --> 01:25:01.880]   Buy and print US postage packages.
[01:25:01.880 --> 01:25:04.280]   Get them ready to go.
[01:25:04.280 --> 01:25:07.840]   Fill out all the forms right at your desk with Stamps.com.
[01:25:07.840 --> 01:25:13.180]   And then a uniformed member of the United States government, aka your postal man, postal
[01:25:13.180 --> 01:25:16.200]   carrier will come and pick it up for you.
[01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:18.040]   LoveStamps.com.
[01:25:18.040 --> 01:25:22.080]   How great would it be if your post office didn't have any lines, didn't have any parking,
[01:25:22.080 --> 01:25:23.960]   was open 24/7.
[01:25:23.960 --> 01:25:27.080]   You get all your mailing and shipping done whenever you wanted.
[01:25:27.080 --> 01:25:33.680]   If you sell on Amazon or eBay or Etsy or anywhere, you need Stamps.com.
[01:25:33.680 --> 01:25:39.600]   If you mail out bills or brochures, if you do any mailing, you need Stamps.com.
[01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:40.600]   You don't have to buy Stamps.
[01:25:40.600 --> 01:25:42.320]   You just print them.
[01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:49.200]   They'll even send you a digital scale so you know exactly how much to print, no more over
[01:25:49.200 --> 01:25:51.920]   paying or underpaying on your postage.
[01:25:51.920 --> 01:25:56.000]   You'll also get, if you go to our special offer, $55 in postage coupons.
[01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:01.520]   That means you get free postage, $55 worth of free postage for you to use over the first
[01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:04.640]   few months of your Stamps.com account.
[01:26:04.640 --> 01:26:07.560]   What's nice is all of the forms you've printed out too.
[01:26:07.560 --> 01:26:08.560]   Here's what you do.
[01:26:08.560 --> 01:26:09.560]   You go to Stamps.com.
[01:26:09.560 --> 01:26:11.400]   You click that microphone in the upper right-hand corner.
[01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:15.080]   You enter the offer code, the promo code TWIT.
[01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:17.320]   Very important you do that because we have a better deal.
[01:26:17.320 --> 01:26:21.800]   You're going to get a $110 bonus offer that gives you a chance to try Stamps.com.
[01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:22.960]   Get the scale.
[01:26:22.960 --> 01:26:23.960]   Get the postage.
[01:26:23.960 --> 01:26:24.960]   Get a supply.
[01:26:24.960 --> 01:26:31.320]   Get everything you need to use Stamps.com.
[01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:32.840]   It looks better too.
[01:26:32.840 --> 01:26:36.600]   I have to say, it makes you look more professional.
[01:26:36.600 --> 01:26:42.000]   Whenever I buy stuff, sometimes I buy stuff from Etsy and it comes with hand written with
[01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:46.960]   a lot of stamps going on around the side and twine.
[01:26:46.960 --> 01:26:47.960]   That's nice.
[01:26:47.960 --> 01:26:48.960]   It's cute.
[01:26:48.960 --> 01:26:53.480]   It would be nice to have exactly the right postage on a label that's printed with just
[01:26:53.480 --> 01:26:55.400]   with your logo.
[01:26:55.400 --> 01:26:59.600]   If there's forms to be filled out, customs forms for international or certified mail
[01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:02.040]   forms, Stamps.com does that for you.
[01:27:02.040 --> 01:27:05.320]   It takes the address you're shipping to from the webpage.
[01:27:05.320 --> 01:27:06.320]   There's no typos.
[01:27:06.320 --> 01:27:08.520]   It puts your return address in there.
[01:27:08.520 --> 01:27:11.680]   It gives you exactly the right postage with the scale.
[01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:13.840]   It's fast.
[01:27:13.840 --> 01:27:14.840]   You do it all at your desk.
[01:27:14.840 --> 01:27:15.840]   I want you to try it.
[01:27:15.840 --> 01:27:17.400]   Go again and go to Stamps.com.
[01:27:17.400 --> 01:27:18.760]   Click the microphone.
[01:27:18.760 --> 01:27:22.400]   Offer code TWIT for our $110 bonus offer.
[01:27:22.400 --> 01:27:26.840]   If you're not using Stamps.com, you're working too hard.
[01:27:26.840 --> 01:27:33.480]   Stamps.com, we thank them for their support.
[01:27:33.480 --> 01:27:35.960]   You've been watching the Olympics, David?
[01:27:35.960 --> 01:27:37.680]   I've been watching some of the Olympics.
[01:27:37.680 --> 01:27:44.440]   The thing that impressed me was this story that says there's 6,800 hours on 11 channels
[01:27:44.440 --> 01:27:51.320]   and God only knows how many individual feeds they've reprogrammed cable boxes to make them
[01:27:51.320 --> 01:27:56.800]   Olympics boxes because the cable company owns the content.
[01:27:56.800 --> 01:28:01.280]   Some cast owns NBC Universal, which is, of course, the company that owns the Olympics
[01:28:01.280 --> 01:28:02.280]   in the United States.
[01:28:02.280 --> 01:28:07.280]   They are betting the company sort of on the Olympics and the future of television as expressed
[01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:09.840]   through these Olympic games.
[01:28:09.840 --> 01:28:11.120]   That's just wrong.
[01:28:11.120 --> 01:28:16.280]   I have said for a zillion years that a company that provides carriage should not be allowed
[01:28:16.280 --> 01:28:21.680]   to be in the content business and we're really finding out why that is.
[01:28:21.680 --> 01:28:26.440]   That all of our content is now being owned by people who do carriage, our significant
[01:28:26.440 --> 01:28:29.640]   parts of it.
[01:28:29.640 --> 01:28:34.760]   If we talk about net neutrality, what is that?
[01:28:34.760 --> 01:28:37.640]   It's just an evil bad and I'll just stop there.
[01:28:37.640 --> 01:28:40.280]   Comcast is an evil bad company.
[01:28:40.280 --> 01:28:41.280]   They are.
[01:28:41.280 --> 01:28:44.000]   If you ever do business with them, you know that.
[01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:47.200]   I tried to watch the Olympics on TV.
[01:28:47.200 --> 01:28:49.120]   This is not to your point.
[01:28:49.120 --> 01:28:51.240]   Maybe it's not cranky enough.
[01:28:51.240 --> 01:28:52.240]   It was terrible.
[01:28:52.240 --> 01:29:00.680]   It was all interviews with what's his name, the swimmer and building up the usual thing.
[01:29:00.680 --> 01:29:06.720]   They focus on the Americans and choose a hero and do a lot of interviews and try to build
[01:29:06.720 --> 01:29:08.800]   up some drama.
[01:29:08.800 --> 01:29:13.480]   The good news is that you can watch what you want to watch on the app, which is actually
[01:29:13.480 --> 01:29:14.480]   pretty good.
[01:29:14.480 --> 01:29:36.400]   The
[01:29:36.400 --> 01:29:59.000]   Olympics, they time shift it, they jam in more commercials than you can eat.
[01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:03.360]   At least they've got an internet strategy that gives you a chance to see some less watch
[01:30:03.360 --> 01:30:05.360]   stuff without interruption.
[01:30:05.360 --> 01:30:10.240]   I'd love to see some stats about how many people are watching it.
[01:30:10.240 --> 01:30:12.040]   I'm sure it's moving that way, right?
[01:30:12.040 --> 01:30:14.040]   But I completely agree with you, David.
[01:30:14.040 --> 01:30:16.960]   Comcast, it's anti-competitive.
[01:30:16.960 --> 01:30:22.000]   They should never have been allowed to buy NBC Universal in the first place.
[01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:28.840]   It's ridiculous that they own the cable box and then they are going to be broadcasting
[01:30:28.840 --> 01:30:29.840]   the Olympics.
[01:30:29.840 --> 01:30:36.600]   As an AT&T customer, I can't get what's on their cable box, which is good in some ways
[01:30:36.600 --> 01:30:38.360]   and bad in other ways.
[01:30:38.360 --> 01:30:42.680]   The government has just so messed up.
[01:30:42.680 --> 01:30:44.640]   Media owners just sleep with this.
[01:30:44.640 --> 01:30:50.080]   Starting with radio and television and how many stations can one company own?
[01:30:50.080 --> 01:30:53.360]   Well, it turns out a thousand, but they can't afford to run any of them.
[01:30:53.360 --> 01:30:54.960]   They're no longer local.
[01:30:54.960 --> 01:30:57.040]   The company's almost horn bankrupt.
[01:30:57.040 --> 01:31:03.520]   Both of them, both iHeart Media and Cumulus are both in deep trouble.
[01:31:03.520 --> 01:31:07.920]   The public ends up getting screwed because nobody was there to tell the money people,
[01:31:07.920 --> 01:31:10.040]   "No, no, you can't do this.
[01:31:10.040 --> 01:31:14.360]   This is bad for the people who you're supposed to be serving."
[01:31:14.360 --> 01:31:17.320]   Just as simple as it is.
[01:31:17.320 --> 01:31:21.800]   What's wonderful about the way it turned out is that we happen to be in what I believe
[01:31:21.800 --> 01:31:27.600]   is the golden age of television with these wonderful series.
[01:31:27.600 --> 01:31:33.040]   Mostly not on the cable, mostly from internet companies like Nick.
[01:31:33.040 --> 01:31:35.000]   The great stuff has moved on.
[01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:36.960]   It's not on the ask for the television.
[01:31:36.960 --> 01:31:40.360]   To answer your question, ratings for the opening ceremony, that's the only thing we
[01:31:40.360 --> 01:31:41.360]   have right now.
[01:31:41.360 --> 01:31:43.880]   We're off 28% from last time.
[01:31:43.880 --> 01:31:47.320]   Well, it was a pretty bad opening ceremony too.
[01:31:47.320 --> 01:31:48.320]   It's always bad.
[01:31:48.320 --> 01:31:51.040]   It's always kitschy and silly.
[01:31:51.040 --> 01:31:55.840]   It's a little bit like the Macy's Thanksgiving parade with the parade of the country.
[01:31:55.840 --> 01:31:58.280]   Not the Chinese opening ceremony.
[01:31:58.280 --> 01:31:59.280]   That was impressive.
[01:31:59.280 --> 01:32:00.280]   That was pretty amazing.
[01:32:00.280 --> 01:32:03.480]   London had 28% better ratings.
[01:32:03.480 --> 01:32:06.440]   Maybe Comcast is getting its kind of...
[01:32:06.440 --> 01:32:11.680]   Well, they went to this light effect in Rio because they didn't have any money to do the
[01:32:11.680 --> 01:32:13.000]   opening ceremonies.
[01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.280]   They did all that light stuff.
[01:32:15.280 --> 01:32:17.960]   I don't know how you make an opening ceremony boring.
[01:32:17.960 --> 01:32:23.720]   I think some of it was Brazil lecturing the world on environmental stewardship.
[01:32:23.720 --> 01:32:27.920]   Is that the same Brazil that I've been thinking about for the last two decades?
[01:32:27.920 --> 01:32:29.920]   The one that's destroying the Amazon?
[01:32:29.920 --> 01:32:30.920]   Burning down the rainforest?
[01:32:30.920 --> 01:32:32.840]   Yeah, burning down the rainforest.
[01:32:32.840 --> 01:32:35.800]   Is it that Brazil we're talking about?
[01:32:35.800 --> 01:32:42.240]   Comcast, of course, being sued by the state of Washington.
[01:32:42.240 --> 01:32:51.360]   A $100 million lawsuit against Comcast accusing the company of 1.8 million violations at the
[01:32:51.360 --> 01:32:53.480]   state's Consumer Protection Act.
[01:32:53.480 --> 01:32:55.280]   That is overachieving, really.
[01:32:55.280 --> 01:32:57.240]   That is quite impressive.
[01:32:57.240 --> 01:33:04.800]   The state isn't saying the customer service was bad, but for misleading practices and
[01:33:04.800 --> 01:33:12.000]   anybody who's gone to Comcast and been offered various weird packages like the $4.99 per person
[01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:16.320]   service protection plan, which Comcast...
[01:33:16.320 --> 01:33:21.520]   That's per month, by the way, $4.99 per month per person service protection plan, which is,
[01:33:21.520 --> 01:33:26.920]   according to the Washington Attorney General, near worthless Comcast.
[01:33:26.920 --> 01:33:30.080]   Promoted the plan is a single fee program that will cover all service calls, including
[01:33:30.080 --> 01:33:31.880]   those involved in wall wiring.
[01:33:31.880 --> 01:33:38.120]   However, any work on wires considered within the walls requiring wall fishing was excluded,
[01:33:38.120 --> 01:33:42.040]   which means, in fact, you have to pay for in wall service calls.
[01:33:42.040 --> 01:33:49.440]   If we have to get the wire, no, that's going to cost you.
[01:33:49.440 --> 01:33:50.440]   And on and on and on.
[01:33:50.440 --> 01:33:52.640]   Anybody's ever dealt with Comcast, especially over the phone.
[01:33:52.640 --> 01:33:58.100]   I have to say, when you go into the Comcast store, where there's actual people, this
[01:33:58.100 --> 01:34:03.960]   underscore is really what I've written realizing when people are face to face or they have
[01:34:03.960 --> 01:34:09.440]   to use their real name in the rear persona, they're almost always unfailingly nice.
[01:34:09.440 --> 01:34:17.520]   It's when they're hiding behind the phone or behind a handle that they can be the jerks
[01:34:17.520 --> 01:34:21.280]   that I think we all have deep within side.
[01:34:21.280 --> 01:34:33.020]   That's also, now this is a new story, just came out, wants to sell your web history.
[01:34:33.020 --> 01:34:40.980]   Comcast is telling the FCC that they, like AT&T, I didn't know this, want to offer reduced
[01:34:40.980 --> 01:34:46.500]   cost plans for customers who say, "Hey, you can track our web history, search activity,
[01:34:46.500 --> 01:34:52.860]   and other online behaviors and sell them to the highest bidder for which I will get
[01:34:52.860 --> 01:34:55.340]   a lower fee for my service."
[01:34:55.340 --> 01:34:58.340]   Well, you know, there is something good about that.
[01:34:58.340 --> 01:34:59.340]   They're doing it anyway.
[01:34:59.340 --> 01:35:00.820]   You might as well get something for it.
[01:35:00.820 --> 01:35:01.820]   Is that what you're going to say?
[01:35:01.820 --> 01:35:02.820]   Right.
[01:35:02.820 --> 01:35:06.580]   Finally, someone's putting some value on the information that they're gathering.
[01:35:06.580 --> 01:35:10.180]   Otherwise, it's being taken for free.
[01:35:10.180 --> 01:35:16.140]   Do we know anybody in the chat room who is accepting AT&T's offer of lower cost service
[01:35:16.140 --> 01:35:21.180]   in return for collecting information about you?
[01:35:21.180 --> 01:35:22.660]   Is anybody doing that?
[01:35:22.660 --> 01:35:25.180]   Doesn't seem like huge.
[01:35:25.180 --> 01:35:32.740]   Well, Amazon does a variety of that when they sell you a fire tablet with ads.
[01:35:32.740 --> 01:35:34.340]   For nothing, for 50 bucks.
[01:35:34.340 --> 01:35:40.900]   If you'll take the ads, they'll give you $15 off lifetime for the cost of the device,
[01:35:40.900 --> 01:35:44.140]   but whenever it's not turned on, it's going to be showing you advertising.
[01:35:44.140 --> 01:35:45.140]   Right.
[01:35:45.140 --> 01:35:49.540]   Well, I think we all know that Google and Facebook are making that tacitly, making that trade
[01:35:49.540 --> 01:35:50.540]   off.
[01:35:50.540 --> 01:35:51.540]   It's a free service.
[01:35:51.540 --> 01:35:55.700]   You get a lot of great free services, but there's a cost in terms of...
[01:35:55.700 --> 01:35:57.020]   Well, that brings us to...
[01:35:57.020 --> 01:36:00.780]   I have a client that is in the native advertising business.
[01:36:00.780 --> 01:36:03.540]   So I am disclaiming that, but what about that?
[01:36:03.540 --> 01:36:06.740]   Native advertising is ads posing as content.
[01:36:06.740 --> 01:36:12.300]   Well, that's the dodgy definition that everybody uses.
[01:36:12.300 --> 01:36:15.780]   And it turns out that a lot of companies are being dodgy.
[01:36:15.780 --> 01:36:21.820]   I saw a study, I'm going to do a blog post on it that says lots and lots of native content,
[01:36:21.820 --> 01:36:26.860]   which is also that content recommendations, all that garbage at the bottom of an average
[01:36:26.860 --> 01:36:27.860]   web page.
[01:36:27.860 --> 01:36:32.700]   All of that is the tabula, the outbrain, neither my client.
[01:36:32.700 --> 01:36:34.980]   That's all what we're talking about.
[01:36:34.980 --> 01:36:41.820]   But they and the newspapers particularly are just recoiling at the rise in ad blockers,
[01:36:41.820 --> 01:36:46.380]   supposedly 20% of mobile users have an ad blocker on.
[01:36:46.380 --> 01:36:50.940]   And the New York Times and some other sites are starting to trap ad blockers and say,
[01:36:50.940 --> 01:36:54.660]   "No, if you're going to block our ads, you're not going to see our content because we've
[01:36:54.660 --> 01:36:57.980]   got to make money off the content."
[01:36:57.980 --> 01:37:05.420]   Well and Facebook and the Federal Trade Commission now are being very clear that you have to
[01:37:05.420 --> 01:37:12.980]   be over and above, you have to really tag stuff as an advertisement that's getting
[01:37:12.980 --> 01:37:16.740]   more and more difficult to pose as content.
[01:37:16.740 --> 01:37:24.220]   Facebook says you have to have information in the post that says this is an ad.
[01:37:24.220 --> 01:37:30.100]   The FTC just announced today that they're going to start cracking down on people on Instagram
[01:37:30.100 --> 01:37:34.740]   and other social feeds who don't sufficiently disclaim the fact that it's an ad.
[01:37:34.740 --> 01:37:40.740]   For instance, very common practice is to put the hashtag ad in there, but to put it in
[01:37:40.740 --> 01:37:46.260]   a big tag cloud at the end of your post and nobody sees it, or to instead of using the
[01:37:46.260 --> 01:37:53.980]   word sponsor, use the word #SP or #SPON, which is not widely understood I think to be a sponsored
[01:37:53.980 --> 01:37:54.980]   post.
[01:37:54.980 --> 01:38:00.980]   So the FTC out recognizes that some of this native content is really just tricking people
[01:38:00.980 --> 01:38:02.220]   into believing it's real.
[01:38:02.220 --> 01:38:05.820]   That's a big problem on social media.
[01:38:05.820 --> 01:38:13.740]   Speaking of big problems on social media and Facebook, I love that they've deprecated clickbait
[01:38:13.740 --> 01:38:14.740]   headlines.
[01:38:14.740 --> 01:38:17.300]   Yeah, that's great.
[01:38:17.300 --> 01:38:19.700]   I can get cranky on Linkbait.
[01:38:19.700 --> 01:38:20.700]   I can get real crankbait.
[01:38:20.700 --> 01:38:21.700]   Oh my God.
[01:38:21.700 --> 01:38:22.700]   Yeah.
[01:38:22.700 --> 01:38:24.540]   They had some good examples here.
[01:38:24.540 --> 01:38:26.180]   Let's see.
[01:38:26.180 --> 01:38:28.340]   You'll never get some change.
[01:38:28.340 --> 01:38:30.620]   Facebook is changing this bar.
[01:38:30.620 --> 01:38:35.220]   Facebook is changing its news feed again, says CNET, and you'll never guess how.
[01:38:35.220 --> 01:38:36.220]   I love it.
[01:38:36.220 --> 01:38:37.220]   Or the examples.
[01:38:37.220 --> 01:38:40.060]   It wasn't in the CNET story.
[01:38:40.060 --> 01:38:43.260]   Oh, it's changing.
[01:38:43.260 --> 01:38:48.660]   You won't believe what's about to happen when you clickbait these headlines.
[01:38:48.660 --> 01:38:49.660]   Jaws dropped.
[01:38:49.660 --> 01:38:55.020]   Jaws went to Jaws dropping and become like headline bait.
[01:38:55.020 --> 01:38:57.100]   Jeff Jarvis often talks about clickbait.
[01:38:57.100 --> 01:39:02.140]   He says, "The thing he hates the most is when it tells you how you're going to feel.
[01:39:02.140 --> 01:39:03.980]   You won't believe what happened next.
[01:39:03.980 --> 01:39:05.660]   The answer will surprise you.
[01:39:05.660 --> 01:39:06.900]   This is amazing.
[01:39:06.900 --> 01:39:11.980]   You're going to," and he just hates that.
[01:39:11.980 --> 01:39:18.440]   At Fortune, towards the end in the Chinese phase of that company, we were instructed
[01:39:18.440 --> 01:39:21.180]   on how to write clickbait headlines.
[01:39:21.180 --> 01:39:28.100]   The trick, according to the guy who was the expert, was to generate an emotion in the
[01:39:28.100 --> 01:39:29.100]   reader.
[01:39:29.100 --> 01:39:30.100]   Right.
[01:39:30.100 --> 01:39:32.540]   That's what all these things are.
[01:39:32.540 --> 01:39:33.700]   Your draw will drop.
[01:39:33.700 --> 01:39:35.700]   You'll be amazed.
[01:39:35.700 --> 01:39:38.660]   Here's from Ted Crunch.
[01:39:38.660 --> 01:39:41.140]   Here's some examples.
[01:39:41.140 --> 01:39:43.460]   She looked under her couch and saw this.
[01:39:43.460 --> 01:39:45.900]   I was shocked.
[01:39:45.900 --> 01:39:47.540]   He put garlic in his shoes.
[01:39:47.540 --> 01:39:50.460]   What happens next is hard to believe.
[01:39:50.460 --> 01:39:57.420]   This dog barked at the delivery man and his reaction was priceless.
[01:39:57.420 --> 01:40:02.700]   The other trick they're using there is to not tell you to leave out the fact that you
[01:40:02.700 --> 01:40:07.060]   have to read the story to get the answer.
[01:40:07.060 --> 01:40:14.300]   It's not that newspapers didn't do that in the past, but when everybody does it all
[01:40:14.300 --> 01:40:17.420]   the time, I don't know.
[01:40:17.420 --> 01:40:18.420]   It makes my head hurt.
[01:40:18.420 --> 01:40:22.220]   Talk about this with my wife this morning because I doubt she's old enough to remember
[01:40:22.220 --> 01:40:30.260]   the classic New York Post headline, "Headless Body Found in Topless Bar."
[01:40:30.260 --> 01:40:32.060]   That's a great headline.
[01:40:32.060 --> 01:40:34.380]   But that one, but it delivered.
[01:40:34.380 --> 01:40:38.620]   There really was a headless body in a Topless Bar.
[01:40:38.620 --> 01:40:40.580]   It wasn't deceptive.
[01:40:40.580 --> 01:40:52.740]   I never had the kind of deception in newspapers that is absolutely common on the Internet today.
[01:40:52.740 --> 01:40:53.740]   I disagree.
[01:40:53.740 --> 01:40:57.020]   Philip suggested newspapers used to be this way.
[01:40:57.020 --> 01:40:59.860]   No, they never really used to be quite this way.
[01:40:59.860 --> 01:41:00.860]   You were not fine.
[01:41:00.860 --> 01:41:01.700]   Well, they didn't need to get clicks.
[01:41:01.700 --> 01:41:07.460]   They just needed you to buy the magazine and the newspaper off the stand.
[01:41:07.460 --> 01:41:10.020]   There was one headline that would get you to buy it.
[01:41:10.020 --> 01:41:15.220]   It was several front page headlines that were as reasonably juiced as they could be, but
[01:41:15.220 --> 01:41:17.540]   ultimately had to pay off.
[01:41:17.540 --> 01:41:23.900]   On the Internet, look how these famous stars, you won't believe number six.
[01:41:23.900 --> 01:41:25.260]   Child stars at the 70.
[01:41:25.260 --> 01:41:26.260]   How do they look now?
[01:41:26.260 --> 01:41:28.220]   You won't believe number five.
[01:41:28.220 --> 01:41:30.820]   Well, right, I didn't believe number five.
[01:41:30.820 --> 01:41:33.020]   I didn't even go there.
[01:41:33.020 --> 01:41:37.300]   When you go there, you don't get that.
[01:41:37.300 --> 01:41:39.100]   No, that's the main problem.
[01:41:39.100 --> 01:41:43.540]   You get 10 other clickbaits.
[01:41:43.540 --> 01:41:48.260]   It's really it's bait and switch 24 hours a day.
[01:41:48.260 --> 01:41:53.900]   It's always been, in my opinion, that any company that does that does that as a last
[01:41:53.900 --> 01:41:58.060]   ditch attempt to save themselves because, of course, you know, eventually your readers
[01:41:58.060 --> 01:42:05.020]   are going to rebel and stop reading your links entirely because if you don't get a payoff,
[01:42:05.020 --> 01:42:06.260]   we're not rats.
[01:42:06.260 --> 01:42:09.060]   Eventually, we are rats.
[01:42:09.060 --> 01:42:10.220]   Eventually, you don't get any cheese.
[01:42:10.220 --> 01:42:13.340]   You're going to stop pressing the lever.
[01:42:13.340 --> 01:42:16.500]   So it's not something you do as a long term strategy.
[01:42:16.500 --> 01:42:17.580]   It's more like desperate.
[01:42:17.580 --> 01:42:22.500]   I would guess it's been going for five or six years now.
[01:42:22.500 --> 01:42:26.340]   Yes, because there's lots of publishers slowly going out of business.
[01:42:26.340 --> 01:42:32.020]   So as each one goes down, you'll see the clickbait, whatever happened to upworthy.
[01:42:32.020 --> 01:42:33.780]   Are they still around?
[01:42:33.780 --> 01:42:35.500]   Yes, but are they?
[01:42:35.500 --> 01:42:36.500]   Hold on.
[01:42:36.500 --> 01:42:37.500]   They're doing video now.
[01:42:37.500 --> 01:42:38.500]   They say they're doing great with video.
[01:42:38.500 --> 01:42:40.180]   Yeah, they're doing great with video.
[01:42:40.180 --> 01:42:42.180]   You won't believe what happened next.
[01:42:42.180 --> 01:42:45.580]   Oh, you must have an opinion on clickbait.
[01:42:45.580 --> 01:42:49.380]   I just love what you guys are talking about.
[01:42:49.380 --> 01:42:53.620]   I think Facebook's right to do this because it hurts them too, right?
[01:42:53.620 --> 01:42:54.620]   I hope so.
[01:42:54.620 --> 01:43:01.180]   Like, you know, they're doing, or maybe they want people to pay for getting their click
[01:43:01.180 --> 01:43:02.900]   paid lines to show up.
[01:43:02.900 --> 01:43:06.180]   If you want to put clickbait, you got to pay.
[01:43:06.180 --> 01:43:08.180]   Yeah, you got to buy some ads.
[01:43:08.180 --> 01:43:09.180]   Yeah.
[01:43:09.180 --> 01:43:15.220]   Nothing in life is free, not even clickbait.
[01:43:15.220 --> 01:43:17.340]   Let's take a tiny little break, come back with more.
[01:43:17.340 --> 01:43:22.060]   We had a great week this week on the network on Twitch, and we have created a small mini
[01:43:22.060 --> 01:43:23.060]   movie.
[01:43:23.060 --> 01:43:24.460]   There is no clickbait in here.
[01:43:24.460 --> 01:43:26.260]   This you will enjoy.
[01:43:26.260 --> 01:43:28.260]   It's officially on Twitch.
[01:43:28.260 --> 01:43:29.260]   No, no!
[01:43:29.260 --> 01:43:36.820]   He dodges the ball, but it is inevitable that he will soon be captured by the Poke Master.
[01:43:36.820 --> 01:43:37.820]   iOS today.
[01:43:37.820 --> 01:43:42.580]   Mark Gerstin is a viewer, and he said, "I want to know what all our apps know about us.
[01:43:42.580 --> 01:43:44.340]   I want to know what apps are using my microphone."
[01:43:44.340 --> 01:43:45.340]   Look at that.
[01:43:45.340 --> 01:43:46.340]   So these are...
[01:43:46.340 --> 01:43:47.820]   And you can disable it at that point.
[01:43:47.820 --> 01:43:49.060]   Twitch Live Specials.
[01:43:49.060 --> 01:43:51.340]   Today, security is not an afterthought.
[01:43:51.340 --> 01:43:55.940]   Today, security is far more important with our mobile devices and are always on networks,
[01:43:55.940 --> 01:44:00.020]   which is why we're here in Las Vegas, Nevada for Black Hat 2016.
[01:44:00.020 --> 01:44:03.500]   I wanted to ride nobody around for ATM machines, and I actually went and looked at the attack
[01:44:03.500 --> 01:44:05.060]   surface of the actual ATMs.
[01:44:05.060 --> 01:44:10.860]   I've created a device that can do the pin entry and that it just spat out money.
[01:44:10.860 --> 01:44:11.860]   Tech News today.
[01:44:11.860 --> 01:44:15.100]   Oh, and you have turned to the emoji dark side.
[01:44:15.100 --> 01:44:16.100]   I have.
[01:44:16.100 --> 01:44:18.940]   I've proved that you are now a emoji convert.
[01:44:18.940 --> 01:44:19.940]   I hate emojis.
[01:44:19.940 --> 01:44:21.580]   I don't like emojis, but you know what?
[01:44:21.580 --> 01:44:23.380]   I use emojis with people that I love.
[01:44:23.380 --> 01:44:25.180]   I eat my daughter and Georgia down.
[01:44:25.180 --> 01:44:29.740]   But if she's going to bash me here on national internet, see, it's falling out for everybody.
[01:44:29.740 --> 01:44:32.020]   Now, nobody gets emojis against it.
[01:44:32.020 --> 01:44:33.020]   Nobody.
[01:44:33.020 --> 01:44:34.020]   We love you.
[01:44:34.020 --> 01:44:37.020]   A great week ahead.
[01:44:37.020 --> 01:44:40.140]   Meghan Moroni has the details.
[01:44:40.140 --> 01:44:41.140]   Thanks, Leo.
[01:44:41.140 --> 01:44:46.140]   There are a few more quarterly earnings reports to look for this week, including Rackspace
[01:44:46.140 --> 01:44:47.140]   and Yelp.
[01:44:47.140 --> 01:44:53.120]   Plus, it's the Usenix security symposium in Austin, Texas, and OpenStack Day Silicon
[01:44:53.120 --> 01:44:54.420]   Valley in Mountain View.
[01:44:54.420 --> 01:44:58.740]   That's the annual open source infrastructure conference held at the Computer History Museum.
[01:44:58.740 --> 01:45:01.500]   And that is just what's happening inside.
[01:45:01.500 --> 01:45:05.500]   Astronomers are predicting that if you head outside on August 11th this week, you'll get
[01:45:05.500 --> 01:45:09.260]   to see the Percy had meteor shower in all its glory.
[01:45:09.260 --> 01:45:15.020]   One final way to celebrate tech this week, it's IBM PC Day on August 12th this week.
[01:45:15.020 --> 01:45:20.100]   In 1981, IBM introduced the model 5150 personal computer.
[01:45:20.100 --> 01:45:21.100]   Let's celebrate.
[01:45:21.100 --> 01:45:22.100]   Back to you, Leo.
[01:45:22.100 --> 01:45:23.100]   Wow.
[01:45:23.100 --> 01:45:24.100]   Okay.
[01:45:24.100 --> 01:45:25.100]   Old cranky guys.
[01:45:25.100 --> 01:45:28.300]   How many of you had a IBM PC 5150?
[01:45:28.300 --> 01:45:29.300]   Anybody?
[01:45:29.300 --> 01:45:31.780]   No, Apple II.
[01:45:31.780 --> 01:45:32.780]   Apple II.
[01:45:32.780 --> 01:45:35.220]   Well, then with action, the Mac was already out by the...
[01:45:35.220 --> 01:45:36.220]   No, no, I guess it wasn't.
[01:45:36.220 --> 01:45:37.220]   This was 81.
[01:45:37.220 --> 01:45:38.220]   Yeah.
[01:45:38.220 --> 01:45:39.220]   Yeah.
[01:45:39.220 --> 01:45:43.140]   I couldn't afford a PC, so I got one of the early clones.
[01:45:43.140 --> 01:45:45.060]   I think it was called an Eagle.
[01:45:45.060 --> 01:45:46.060]   I remember that.
[01:45:46.060 --> 01:45:47.060]   It was terrible.
[01:45:47.060 --> 01:45:48.060]   I had a KPro.
[01:45:48.060 --> 01:45:49.060]   KPros were cool.
[01:45:49.060 --> 01:45:50.060]   I was one of those.
[01:45:50.060 --> 01:45:51.060]   I had a KPro.
[01:45:51.060 --> 01:45:52.060]   Yeah.
[01:45:52.060 --> 01:45:53.060]   KPro was...
[01:45:53.060 --> 01:45:54.300]   And a Ks and not enough pros.
[01:45:54.300 --> 01:45:55.700]   What was the company under?
[01:45:55.700 --> 01:45:56.700]   It was running CPM.
[01:45:56.700 --> 01:45:57.700]   Yes it was.
[01:45:57.700 --> 01:46:02.420]   They said that people that carried KPros around still have a tilt to their body.
[01:46:02.420 --> 01:46:07.140]   I guess it was a 30-pound portable.
[01:46:07.140 --> 01:46:09.580]   We've come a long way.
[01:46:09.580 --> 01:46:12.260]   Oh, what was your first computer?
[01:46:12.260 --> 01:46:13.740]   It was a Windows 3.1.
[01:46:13.740 --> 01:46:14.740]   Oh boy.
[01:46:14.740 --> 01:46:15.740]   Oh, computer.
[01:46:15.740 --> 01:46:19.460]   I can't even remember the name of the brand.
[01:46:19.460 --> 01:46:20.460]   It was just some...
[01:46:20.460 --> 01:46:21.460]   Did you remember the...
[01:46:21.460 --> 01:46:22.460]   leading edge.
[01:46:22.460 --> 01:46:25.380]   Yeah, I remember leading edge and Packard Bell.
[01:46:25.380 --> 01:46:26.380]   No.
[01:46:26.380 --> 01:46:27.380]   I was...
[01:46:27.380 --> 01:46:29.260]   Bell came back for a while.
[01:46:29.260 --> 01:46:31.660]   He was something worse than that.
[01:46:31.660 --> 01:46:32.820]   PC's limited.
[01:46:32.820 --> 01:46:34.300]   Oh, PC's limited.
[01:46:34.300 --> 01:46:36.900]   No, I just bought it from a guy.
[01:46:36.900 --> 01:46:38.740]   You know, it was like...
[01:46:38.740 --> 01:46:39.740]   Some guys.
[01:46:39.740 --> 01:46:42.740]   He just, I think he put it together and sold it to me.
[01:46:42.740 --> 01:46:44.980]   Actually, it was not Windows 3.1.
[01:46:44.980 --> 01:46:46.700]   It was Windows MS-DOS.
[01:46:46.700 --> 01:46:47.700]   Oh, yeah.
[01:46:47.700 --> 01:46:50.220]   So it was right about that era then.
[01:46:50.220 --> 01:46:52.340]   You did that in Austin, Texas.
[01:46:52.340 --> 01:46:53.540]   The guy was Michael Bell.
[01:46:53.540 --> 01:46:54.540]   Yeah.
[01:46:54.540 --> 01:46:55.540]   That's who it would have been.
[01:46:55.540 --> 01:46:56.540]   It was dorm room, right?
[01:46:56.540 --> 01:46:59.420]   And that was the trunk of the car.
[01:46:59.420 --> 01:47:00.420]   Really?
[01:47:00.420 --> 01:47:01.420]   Yes.
[01:47:01.420 --> 01:47:02.420]   Do you want to buy a PC?
[01:47:02.420 --> 01:47:03.420]   I got some great ones in here.
[01:47:03.420 --> 01:47:10.820]   You know, some guy in the 30th street or 34th street or 35th street in New York.
[01:47:10.820 --> 01:47:12.420]   Like this was when I was living in New York.
[01:47:12.420 --> 01:47:15.260]   Five dollar watches and Windows 3.1 PC's.
[01:47:15.260 --> 01:47:19.740]   No, it was like somebody was like in one of these buildings, you had to go up to his office.
[01:47:19.740 --> 01:47:20.740]   Oh my God.
[01:47:20.740 --> 01:47:21.740]   Oh my God.
[01:47:21.740 --> 01:47:22.740]   Like...
[01:47:22.740 --> 01:47:23.740]   And what did you want to do with it?
[01:47:23.740 --> 01:47:25.140]   Why did you think this was a good idea?
[01:47:25.140 --> 01:47:32.980]   I just wanted to learn a few things, use it for word processing, also learn a little
[01:47:32.980 --> 01:47:35.060]   bit of basic.
[01:47:35.060 --> 01:47:37.060]   Yeah.
[01:47:37.060 --> 01:47:39.300]   And I was early days.
[01:47:39.300 --> 01:47:49.660]   Did you notice like this was 25 years ago when the website went up?
[01:47:49.660 --> 01:47:51.540]   25 years ago.
[01:47:51.540 --> 01:47:52.540]   This week.
[01:47:52.540 --> 01:47:53.540]   Wow.
[01:47:53.540 --> 01:47:54.540]   Yeah.
[01:47:54.540 --> 01:47:55.540]   There you go.
[01:47:55.540 --> 01:47:58.100]   We got this is a bunch of anniversaries.
[01:47:58.100 --> 01:47:59.100]   We've come a long way.
[01:47:59.100 --> 01:48:00.660]   The first website went online.
[01:48:00.660 --> 01:48:01.660]   What was the first?
[01:48:01.660 --> 01:48:02.660]   Was it Tim Berners-Lee?
[01:48:02.660 --> 01:48:03.660]   Yeah.
[01:48:03.660 --> 01:48:04.660]   There's Tim.
[01:48:04.660 --> 01:48:05.660]   Yeah.
[01:48:05.660 --> 01:48:08.060]   Sir Tim, I should call him now.
[01:48:08.060 --> 01:48:13.460]   It was a basic test or I'm sorry text page with hyperlinks.
[01:48:13.460 --> 01:48:18.100]   He was a physicist worked at CERN at the particle lab and he wanted to share papers with colleagues
[01:48:18.100 --> 01:48:22.980]   and let them annotate them as well as read them.
[01:48:22.980 --> 01:48:25.060]   So he created the world wide web on that.
[01:48:25.060 --> 01:48:26.900]   That's a next cue.
[01:48:26.900 --> 01:48:27.900]   Yeah.
[01:48:27.900 --> 01:48:29.780]   It's one computer I never own.
[01:48:29.780 --> 01:48:30.780]   Wish I had though.
[01:48:30.780 --> 01:48:31.780]   Love that.
[01:48:31.780 --> 01:48:32.780]   That looks so good.
[01:48:32.780 --> 01:48:33.780]   Yeah.
[01:48:33.780 --> 01:48:34.780]   Beautiful.
[01:48:34.780 --> 01:48:35.780]   Didn't work so good, I think.
[01:48:35.780 --> 01:48:38.540]   Look, that's these jobs in a nutshell, man.
[01:48:38.540 --> 01:48:40.180]   It sure looked good.
[01:48:40.180 --> 01:48:42.540]   It didn't come with a hard drive.
[01:48:42.540 --> 01:48:43.540]   Yeah.
[01:48:43.540 --> 01:48:44.540]   Yeah.
[01:48:44.540 --> 01:48:45.860]   It worked so good, but man, did it look pretty well?
[01:48:45.860 --> 01:48:46.860]   It was crashing.
[01:48:46.860 --> 01:48:48.900]   It's a little, I had them for just time.
[01:48:48.900 --> 01:48:49.900]   Maybe that's it.
[01:48:49.900 --> 01:48:53.980]   After all, hey, if that's the only thing people did with the next box is write the
[01:48:53.980 --> 01:48:55.900]   world wide web.
[01:48:55.900 --> 01:48:56.900]   Pretty damn good.
[01:48:56.900 --> 01:48:57.900]   That ain't bad.
[01:48:57.900 --> 01:48:58.900]   Right.
[01:48:58.900 --> 01:49:00.660]   And it led to OS X too.
[01:49:00.660 --> 01:49:05.620]   That's true because next step the operating system became OS X.
[01:49:05.620 --> 01:49:06.620]   Absolutely.
[01:49:06.620 --> 01:49:13.700]   I have to say as a cranky old, you know, person, God, I've missed you, jobs man.
[01:49:13.700 --> 01:49:15.660]   He made it interesting.
[01:49:15.660 --> 01:49:16.660]   Yeah.
[01:49:16.660 --> 01:49:21.180]   Well, earlier during the Apple discussion, I was going to ask the question, what would
[01:49:21.180 --> 01:49:24.060]   Steve Jobs do when Steve died?
[01:49:24.060 --> 01:49:28.540]   There was a lot of discussion over how much product pipeline is there.
[01:49:28.540 --> 01:49:31.700]   I think we agreed the watch was the last thing he might have touched, right?
[01:49:31.700 --> 01:49:33.140]   I did just about tell.
[01:49:33.140 --> 01:49:36.820]   I read recently that he was talking about a car too.
[01:49:36.820 --> 01:49:41.740]   That by the way, I'm sorry is the stupidest thing Apple can do.
[01:49:41.740 --> 01:49:48.380]   If you think it's bad that they're doing a TV show, reality show about apps, the car,
[01:49:48.380 --> 01:49:50.660]   project Titan is even worse.
[01:49:50.660 --> 01:49:52.580]   Well, we disagree there.
[01:49:52.580 --> 01:49:53.580]   Really?
[01:49:53.580 --> 01:49:55.300]   I think that's getting your eye off the ball big time.
[01:49:55.300 --> 01:49:58.460]   That is such a long, that's a moonshot.
[01:49:58.460 --> 01:49:59.460]   Yeah.
[01:49:59.460 --> 01:50:03.460]   Well, and you know, one stock that I would short is Tesla.
[01:50:03.460 --> 01:50:04.460]   Really?
[01:50:04.460 --> 01:50:05.460]   Yeah.
[01:50:05.460 --> 01:50:06.460]   I just got a Tesla.
[01:50:06.460 --> 01:50:07.460]   I love it.
[01:50:07.460 --> 01:50:08.460]   I know.
[01:50:08.460 --> 01:50:09.460]   Well, you love it.
[01:50:09.460 --> 01:50:10.460]   I think Elon Musk is the new Steve Jobs.
[01:50:10.460 --> 01:50:14.260]   The most interesting guy out there doing the most interesting things with the broadest,
[01:50:14.260 --> 01:50:17.220]   longest term vision of them all.
[01:50:17.220 --> 01:50:18.220]   Why SpaceX?
[01:50:18.220 --> 01:50:21.780]   He wants to harvest trillion dollar asteroids.
[01:50:21.780 --> 01:50:23.100]   Have you read the book about him?
[01:50:23.100 --> 01:50:24.460]   Yeah, Ashley Vance's book.
[01:50:24.460 --> 01:50:27.260]   Yeah, I interviewed Ashley as well.
[01:50:27.260 --> 01:50:31.100]   I knew Steve Jobs and he's no Steve Jobs.
[01:50:31.100 --> 01:50:34.340]   All right.
[01:50:34.340 --> 01:50:36.220]   He's not his arrogant anyway.
[01:50:36.220 --> 01:50:44.060]   Now Steve was a piece of work and I think fun, not so much to work for.
[01:50:44.060 --> 01:50:47.180]   He's fun to watch.
[01:50:47.180 --> 01:50:48.660]   Fun to watch.
[01:50:48.660 --> 01:50:52.740]   And that's one thing Steve did that none of these Jeff doesn't do, Mark doesn't do.
[01:50:52.740 --> 01:50:54.580]   He really, he put on a show.
[01:50:54.580 --> 01:50:56.740]   He knew how to put on a show.
[01:50:56.740 --> 01:51:00.500]   And that's really, I think, as tech journalist, that's what we really honor him for is there
[01:51:00.500 --> 01:51:01.500]   was nobody better.
[01:51:01.500 --> 01:51:03.340]   He was the PT Barnum of technology.
[01:51:03.340 --> 01:51:09.700]   It was nobody better at putting on a show.
[01:51:09.700 --> 01:51:10.700]   That's all I'll give him, frankly.
[01:51:10.700 --> 01:51:13.180]   So that's our third obituary of the...
[01:51:13.180 --> 01:51:16.540]   Well he died a while, so I think he's been gone for a while.
[01:51:16.540 --> 01:51:20.620]   Meanwhile, you can now put a phone in your pocket that has 10 times the power of any
[01:51:20.620 --> 01:51:24.140]   of those early computers, a thousand times, a hundred thousand times.
[01:51:24.140 --> 01:51:30.180]   Samsung announced this week it's Galaxy Note 7 with an iris scanner.
[01:51:30.180 --> 01:51:34.660]   So you can just look at your phone and it'll go, "I see you.
[01:51:34.660 --> 01:51:37.300]   I know you."
[01:51:37.300 --> 01:51:41.340]   Unclear how well it will work, although my colleagues who were at the event said it worked
[01:51:41.340 --> 01:51:42.340]   very well very fast.
[01:51:42.340 --> 01:51:46.820]   We've seen iris scanners at phones before, most notably the Windows phone, the 950 and
[01:51:46.820 --> 01:51:50.620]   the 950 XL for Microsoft, which was terrible.
[01:51:50.620 --> 01:51:54.620]   Today on the radio show is like your dad taking a picture, a little closer, not a little
[01:51:54.620 --> 01:51:55.620]   far.
[01:51:55.620 --> 01:51:58.020]   Up, look up, look down, look down.
[01:51:58.020 --> 01:52:01.420]   Left, left, left, left, right, right.
[01:52:01.420 --> 01:52:06.700]   Nobody wants to do that, but apparently the iris scanner, the Galaxy Note 7 will pick up
[01:52:06.700 --> 01:52:11.820]   your iris even if you're not looking directly at it.
[01:52:11.820 --> 01:52:16.740]   But I'll tell you, this is just another example of how we are really at peak computing.
[01:52:16.740 --> 01:52:20.660]   I mean, hard to come up with something new, isn't it?
[01:52:20.660 --> 01:52:21.740]   Wow.
[01:52:21.740 --> 01:52:23.020]   How can you say that?
[01:52:23.020 --> 01:52:24.660]   Dude, do you seem...
[01:52:24.660 --> 01:52:26.260]   I'm jaded and old.
[01:52:26.260 --> 01:52:36.220]   No, 25 years, internet was just, web was just like a document which, you know, served
[01:52:36.220 --> 01:52:38.620]   him put on the internet.
[01:52:38.620 --> 01:52:40.180]   And today it's in our pocket.
[01:52:40.180 --> 01:52:41.180]   We do amazing things.
[01:52:41.180 --> 01:52:43.820]   But it's been in our pocket for some time now.
[01:52:43.820 --> 01:52:44.820]   Yeah.
[01:52:44.820 --> 01:52:46.580]   What have you done for me lately?
[01:52:46.580 --> 01:52:47.580]   Yeah.
[01:52:47.580 --> 01:52:54.820]   But like, we've only barely started to figure out what to do with all the information which
[01:52:54.820 --> 01:52:55.820]   is out there.
[01:52:55.820 --> 01:53:02.380]   We've barely figured out how to use all these sensor related data which we get from our
[01:53:02.380 --> 01:53:03.380]   phones.
[01:53:03.380 --> 01:53:06.540]   I mean, we've barely scratched the surface.
[01:53:06.540 --> 01:53:12.420]   I am more excited about technology today than I was five years ago.
[01:53:12.420 --> 01:53:15.420]   And five years ago, I was more excited about the future.
[01:53:15.420 --> 01:53:17.140]   I was 10 years ago.
[01:53:17.140 --> 01:53:23.380]   I just feel, you know, we will never be peak human intelligence.
[01:53:23.380 --> 01:53:29.140]   We will never, you know, despite what people say about artificial intelligence, the human
[01:53:29.140 --> 01:53:34.260]   brain is still not understood what it's capable of.
[01:53:34.260 --> 01:53:40.300]   I think it is an amazing, amazing time to be in technology.
[01:53:40.300 --> 01:53:43.460]   I wake up every day and I'm still excited about it.
[01:53:43.460 --> 01:53:49.900]   I am still excited about the idea that some kids somewhere is going to blow our socks
[01:53:49.900 --> 01:53:52.820]   off and we will rethink the future again.
[01:53:52.820 --> 01:53:58.100]   I think that is what makes this industry what it is.
[01:53:58.100 --> 01:54:03.060]   It's like, you know, we started off with a guy like Blake who decided that he wanted
[01:54:03.060 --> 01:54:09.780]   to watch his favorite basketball game and baseball game while he was in Japan.
[01:54:09.780 --> 01:54:11.340]   So he invented play shifting.
[01:54:11.340 --> 01:54:17.820]   And I think there will be some guy who will come up with another new thing or a gal or,
[01:54:17.820 --> 01:54:22.060]   you know, whether it is in US, it's in China, who the hell knows.
[01:54:22.060 --> 01:54:25.300]   The future is, you know, yet to be invented.
[01:54:25.300 --> 01:54:27.140]   I love that optimism moment.
[01:54:27.140 --> 01:54:30.260]   I, of course, that's true.
[01:54:30.260 --> 01:54:32.100]   It's a can we end the show now?
[01:54:32.100 --> 01:54:33.900]   No, I have one more ad.
[01:54:33.900 --> 01:54:38.940]   But then actually before before I want to do the ad, but before we go, I want to give
[01:54:38.940 --> 01:54:41.060]   you a little time to think during the ad.
[01:54:41.060 --> 01:54:42.580]   I agree with you, Om.
[01:54:42.580 --> 01:54:48.300]   And the problem is right now what we see is a lot of, you know, shiny new attempts like
[01:54:48.300 --> 01:54:52.260]   VR that maybe just really aren't going to change the world.
[01:54:52.260 --> 01:54:56.380]   So I'd like you guys to talk about when we come back.
[01:54:56.380 --> 01:54:59.940]   We don't know who is going to who that person is and what garage they're working in or
[01:54:59.940 --> 01:55:00.940]   what they're working on.
[01:55:00.940 --> 01:55:06.460]   But maybe you have some thoughts about what area is what direction will be, you know,
[01:55:06.460 --> 01:55:08.860]   interesting in the next few years.
[01:55:08.860 --> 01:55:11.420]   I would love to hear what you guys think because I agree with you.
[01:55:11.420 --> 01:55:12.420]   I agree with you.
[01:55:12.420 --> 01:55:15.100]   I think we should there's a lot a lot to be positive about.
[01:55:15.100 --> 01:55:16.700]   There's also a lot of junk.
[01:55:16.700 --> 01:55:17.700]   Right?
[01:55:17.700 --> 01:55:19.380]   Yeah, there is.
[01:55:19.380 --> 01:55:22.500]   And you know, the great thing is where there is junk.
[01:55:22.500 --> 01:55:24.340]   There is an opportunity.
[01:55:24.340 --> 01:55:26.180]   You play Pokemon go on.
[01:55:26.180 --> 01:55:27.540]   Oh, love it.
[01:55:27.540 --> 01:55:29.100]   Yeah, it's fun, isn't it?
[01:55:29.100 --> 01:55:30.100]   That who would have thought?
[01:55:30.100 --> 01:55:31.700]   I mean, that came out of nowhere, right?
[01:55:31.700 --> 01:55:39.500]   I was in San Diego on Thursday night driving down Coronado, which is a long peninsula leading
[01:55:39.500 --> 01:55:41.740]   to an air, a naval base.
[01:55:41.740 --> 01:55:44.020]   And there's a aren't on orange Avenue.
[01:55:44.020 --> 01:55:50.500]   There's a median strip and apparently just by active chance and niantic, there are I
[01:55:50.500 --> 01:55:57.340]   think three or four pokey stops and a pokey gym in one small area.
[01:55:57.340 --> 01:56:01.420]   And in fact, every time we drove by it, we noticed there were lures on the pokey gym.
[01:56:01.420 --> 01:56:04.100]   On Thursday night must have been 10 p.m.
[01:56:04.100 --> 01:56:10.220]   But we've gone to see a play and we came out of the plate, took an Uber home.
[01:56:10.220 --> 01:56:12.820]   There are it's like wood stock.
[01:56:12.820 --> 01:56:14.700]   There are it is.
[01:56:14.700 --> 01:56:16.460]   I'm looking at Lisa.
[01:56:16.460 --> 01:56:17.460]   What's going on?
[01:56:17.460 --> 01:56:19.860]   And then we realized, oh, they're all going like this.
[01:56:19.860 --> 01:56:22.020]   They're all swiping up with their finger.
[01:56:22.020 --> 01:56:31.540]   There are literally in a tiny area, a thousand people jammed together playing Pokemon go.
[01:56:31.540 --> 01:56:38.780]   Two hundred million dollars in one month in global revenue, one month.
[01:56:38.780 --> 01:56:39.780]   Maybe that's the next big thing.
[01:56:39.780 --> 01:56:42.700]   Anyway, your next big thing when we come back.
[01:56:42.700 --> 01:56:46.580]   But let's just briefly say, you got to back up your data.
[01:56:46.580 --> 01:56:51.820]   I get calls so often for people to say, you know, there's something on my phone or my
[01:56:51.820 --> 01:56:52.820]   hard drive.
[01:56:52.820 --> 01:56:53.820]   I have pictures.
[01:56:53.820 --> 01:56:54.820]   I drive dive.
[01:56:54.820 --> 01:56:55.900]   What do I do?
[01:56:55.900 --> 01:56:59.940]   And I have to say, didn't haven't do you not have a backup?
[01:56:59.940 --> 01:57:02.380]   How could you not in this day and age have a backup?
[01:57:02.380 --> 01:57:05.540]   And really, the best backup should be cloud backup, right?
[01:57:05.540 --> 01:57:07.060]   I mean, it's great to have a local backup.
[01:57:07.060 --> 01:57:09.780]   I do it all the time.
[01:57:09.780 --> 01:57:12.780]   But ideally, you have a backup that's stored off site.
[01:57:12.780 --> 01:57:16.980]   So if the worst happens, a fire, a flood, somebody comes steals your stuff.
[01:57:16.980 --> 01:57:22.220]   The easiest way to do this is carbon, carbonite online backup.
[01:57:22.220 --> 01:57:25.980]   This was created by a David friend, a good friend of mine.
[01:57:25.980 --> 01:57:27.620]   I really like this guy.
[01:57:27.620 --> 01:57:31.860]   He had a, you know, he was a, I think he created the ARPS synthesizer.
[01:57:31.860 --> 01:57:32.860]   He kind of semi-retired.
[01:57:32.860 --> 01:57:34.580]   He had a daughter in college.
[01:57:34.580 --> 01:57:38.140]   He called him up and said, Daddy, I just lost my term paper.
[01:57:38.140 --> 01:57:39.140]   I don't have a backup.
[01:57:39.140 --> 01:57:40.140]   What do I do?
[01:57:40.140 --> 01:57:45.020]   And he thought with all the things we've solved in personal computing, we haven't really
[01:57:45.020 --> 01:57:46.780]   figured out a good solution for this.
[01:57:46.780 --> 01:57:54.140]   So he founded carbonite, automatic, continuous offsite backup, cloud backup.
[01:57:54.140 --> 01:57:55.780]   And he did it right too.
[01:57:55.780 --> 01:57:58.140]   He made it flat pricing, flat fee pricing.
[01:57:58.140 --> 01:58:00.900]   So you don't have to worry about how much have I backed up, how much am I storing?
[01:58:00.900 --> 01:58:02.460]   What's the bill going to be next month?
[01:58:02.460 --> 01:58:07.860]   You pay once a year, $59.99 for everything on a single computer.
[01:58:07.860 --> 01:58:12.780]   This was a five bucks a month for your Mac or your PC, but they have server backup.
[01:58:12.780 --> 01:58:15.540]   They do small business, big business.
[01:58:15.540 --> 01:58:19.060]   They have a plan for everyone.
[01:58:19.060 --> 01:58:22.260]   This stat just depresses the heck out of me from the carbonite website.
[01:58:22.260 --> 01:58:25.900]   30% of people have never backed up anything ever.
[01:58:25.900 --> 01:58:29.660]   And I'd say twice that number are backing up in a way that's not going to work.
[01:58:29.660 --> 01:58:31.420]   They're not going to get their data back.
[01:58:31.420 --> 01:58:32.980]   You got to try carbonite.
[01:58:32.980 --> 01:58:38.460]   And with ransomware all over the place in the windows space, carbonite is the solution
[01:58:38.460 --> 01:58:44.260]   because it does versioning on windows, which means you will never have to worry about ransomware.
[01:58:44.260 --> 01:58:49.220]   Over 500 billion files backed up and counting, one and a half million homes and businesses.
[01:58:49.220 --> 01:58:51.380]   You got to try it and you could try it for free.
[01:58:51.380 --> 01:58:53.300]   You don't even need to give them a credit card.
[01:58:53.300 --> 01:58:56.460]   Just go to carbonite.com and use the offer code TWIT.
[01:58:56.460 --> 01:59:00.100]   The only reason I want you to do that is that way you get two months free if you decide
[01:59:00.100 --> 01:59:01.620]   to buy.
[01:59:01.620 --> 01:59:08.020]   You can check in with your data anytime you want using the carbonite apps on your smartphone.
[01:59:08.020 --> 01:59:09.820]   You can even download and email data.
[01:59:09.820 --> 01:59:13.900]   So it's kind of like cloud storage too, or you log on to your carbonite and account on
[01:59:13.900 --> 01:59:14.900]   any computer.
[01:59:14.900 --> 01:59:15.900]   There's your stuff.
[01:59:15.900 --> 01:59:17.620]   So you always know it's safe.
[01:59:17.620 --> 01:59:23.100]   Carbonite.com is the offer code TWIT.
[01:59:23.100 --> 01:59:24.100]   Do you play?
[01:59:24.100 --> 01:59:29.300]   For some reason I feel like David Corsi, you do not play Pokemon Go.
[01:59:29.300 --> 01:59:31.020]   I think it's a public nuisance.
[01:59:31.020 --> 01:59:32.020]   That's what I would say.
[01:59:32.020 --> 01:59:33.020]   Go right ahead.
[01:59:33.020 --> 01:59:34.020]   Yeah, that's what I thought.
[01:59:34.020 --> 01:59:36.820]   I don't know how I knew that.
[01:59:36.820 --> 01:59:39.820]   And Phillip, I'm guessing you haven't played it either.
[01:59:39.820 --> 01:59:43.660]   I had to try it.
[01:59:43.660 --> 01:59:46.420]   And then I decided life was too short.
[01:59:46.420 --> 01:59:48.980]   Nah, I was never too short for a great game.
[01:59:48.980 --> 01:59:57.020]   But the real winner in Pokemon Go, it turns out the smart phone battery sales have gone
[01:59:57.020 --> 02:00:06.220]   up 101% in the two weeks from July 10th to July 23rd, year to year over year, doubled.
[02:00:06.220 --> 02:00:07.220]   And you know why?
[02:00:07.220 --> 02:00:12.860]   Because it kills me better and people want to see that there on Orange Avenue and play
[02:00:12.860 --> 02:00:14.820]   Pokemon Go all night.
[02:00:14.820 --> 02:00:16.820]   Hey, nothing wrong with that.
[02:00:16.820 --> 02:00:20.740]   I'm perfectly fine with something that gets me moving.
[02:00:20.740 --> 02:00:24.140]   Well, I have to say that's the thing I find most interesting when you go down and you
[02:00:24.140 --> 02:00:25.620]   see all these people.
[02:00:25.620 --> 02:00:28.020]   It's like there's a rock festival going on, except it's not.
[02:00:28.020 --> 02:00:30.700]   They're just hanging out and they're talking to each other.
[02:00:30.700 --> 02:00:33.860]   There's a great feeling, a great vibe in the air.
[02:00:33.860 --> 02:00:34.860]   It was kind of cool.
[02:00:34.860 --> 02:00:38.340]   It was really like kind of wood stock in the middle of just this.
[02:00:38.340 --> 02:00:43.740]   And the same thing in parks all around here, Golden Gate Park in San Francisco, Central
[02:00:43.740 --> 02:00:45.060]   Park in New York.
[02:00:45.060 --> 02:00:47.900]   It's people are walking and they're talking.
[02:00:47.900 --> 02:00:50.500]   So I'm all for it.
[02:00:50.500 --> 02:00:54.100]   It is clearly a phenomenon.
[02:00:54.100 --> 02:01:01.700]   Here's a graph from Sensor Tower estimates, of course, because nobody's talking on the
[02:01:01.700 --> 02:01:03.260]   top grossing mobile games.
[02:01:03.260 --> 02:01:04.260]   Whoops.
[02:01:04.260 --> 02:01:06.820]   Let me just scroll down so fast.
[02:01:06.820 --> 02:01:11.420]   The good news is Candy Crush soda, which you thought was doing pretty well.
[02:01:11.420 --> 02:01:12.420]   That's the baseline there.
[02:01:12.420 --> 02:01:14.500]   That's the pink line.
[02:01:14.500 --> 02:01:17.100]   There's a clash of clans, even better.
[02:01:17.100 --> 02:01:22.100]   Here's Pokemon Go, which matched classic clans in the first two weeks of its release.
[02:01:22.100 --> 02:01:26.660]   But then they launched in Japan and the afterburners came on.
[02:01:26.660 --> 02:01:32.100]   And now according to Sensor Tower, $225 million in revenue.
[02:01:32.100 --> 02:01:33.300]   Can I ask a dumb question?
[02:01:33.300 --> 02:01:35.300]   It's a free game.
[02:01:35.300 --> 02:01:36.380]   Yeah.
[02:01:36.380 --> 02:01:41.420]   Can people participate in the placement of these pokies?
[02:01:41.420 --> 02:01:44.020]   I mean, can I start distributing them?
[02:01:44.020 --> 02:01:45.020]   No.
[02:01:45.020 --> 02:01:46.020]   Oh.
[02:01:46.020 --> 02:01:49.660]   Although small businesses have really benefited from this because you can put a lure up and
[02:01:49.660 --> 02:01:51.620]   lure attracts Pokemon.
[02:01:51.620 --> 02:01:55.500]   And so if you're a small business like we are, we have a pokies stop right across the street
[02:01:55.500 --> 02:01:56.500]   here.
[02:01:56.500 --> 02:01:57.620]   I could put a lure on it.
[02:01:57.620 --> 02:01:59.020]   If you're a coffee shop, you put a lure.
[02:01:59.020 --> 02:02:01.380]   In fact, I've seen bookstores in town.
[02:02:01.380 --> 02:02:04.740]   Our local independent bookstore say we're going to have a lure at 2 p.m. come by, have
[02:02:04.740 --> 02:02:07.820]   a cup of coffee, read a book, and catch some Pokemon.
[02:02:07.820 --> 02:02:09.540]   So individuals could do that too.
[02:02:09.540 --> 02:02:10.540]   Yeah.
[02:02:10.540 --> 02:02:11.540]   Anybody could buy a lure.
[02:02:11.540 --> 02:02:12.540]   It's a buck.
[02:02:12.540 --> 02:02:13.540]   Oh, you buy them.
[02:02:13.540 --> 02:02:14.540]   Ah.
[02:02:14.540 --> 02:02:17.860]   Now you know where the $220 million came from.
[02:02:17.860 --> 02:02:19.900]   So how long is this going to last?
[02:02:19.900 --> 02:02:23.500]   What is the fad element of Pokemon Go?
[02:02:23.500 --> 02:02:26.020]   Is it like Facebook just a fad?
[02:02:26.020 --> 02:02:29.620]   Well, Facebook will last longer.
[02:02:29.620 --> 02:02:30.620]   Facebook did it.
[02:02:30.620 --> 02:02:31.620]   I don't know.
[02:02:31.620 --> 02:02:32.620]   Who knows?
[02:02:32.620 --> 02:02:33.620]   No one knows.
[02:02:33.620 --> 02:02:34.700]   Facebook did an interesting thing that might have been kind of controversial.
[02:02:34.700 --> 02:02:37.380]   They just imitated Snapchat.
[02:02:37.380 --> 02:02:41.820]   One of Snapchat's interesting features that was added more recently.
[02:02:41.820 --> 02:02:45.460]   You know, Snapchat allows you to do video and pictures and message people and the pictures
[02:02:45.460 --> 02:02:48.540]   and video disappear after the people look at it.
[02:02:48.540 --> 02:02:52.740]   So it's kind of a way for young people to send messages to each other more privately.
[02:02:52.740 --> 02:02:53.820]   They don't last forever.
[02:02:53.820 --> 02:02:55.820]   Young people love Snapchat.
[02:02:55.820 --> 02:03:01.300]   Instagram, which is, you know, part of Facebook's problem is its audience is aging.
[02:03:01.300 --> 02:03:03.340]   Kids think it's mom's social network.
[02:03:03.340 --> 02:03:05.100]   They don't want to be on it.
[02:03:05.100 --> 02:03:07.100]   Although I think everybody uses it anyway.
[02:03:07.100 --> 02:03:08.660]   They may not be thrilled about it.
[02:03:08.660 --> 02:03:12.220]   Instagram has a little bit of a younger skew, a lot smaller market.
[02:03:12.220 --> 02:03:14.820]   So they've added a feature of Snapchat called Stories.
[02:03:14.820 --> 02:03:20.140]   Stories allow you to do Snapchat videos and pictures that last longer and can be viewed
[02:03:20.140 --> 02:03:22.420]   again and again.
[02:03:22.420 --> 02:03:27.740]   The Facebook, I mean, Snapchat's stories disappear after 24 hours.
[02:03:27.740 --> 02:03:33.820]   So Instagram did pretty much exactly the same thing.
[02:03:33.820 --> 02:03:38.820]   Copycats or good move?
[02:03:38.820 --> 02:03:40.740]   The Facebook conversion evolution.
[02:03:40.740 --> 02:03:45.740]   This one.
[02:03:45.740 --> 02:03:51.380]   By the way, Kevin's system who created Instagram and sold it to Facebook said, "Look, yeah,
[02:03:51.380 --> 02:03:52.380]   we're copying them.
[02:03:52.380 --> 02:03:54.940]   We're really impressed with what Snapchat has been able to do.
[02:03:54.940 --> 02:03:58.700]   We'd like to do a little of the same thing."
[02:03:58.700 --> 02:04:02.580]   I think the only risk is that Instagram works so well as just as you use it all the time.
[02:04:02.580 --> 02:04:04.980]   I see your wonderful pictures all the time.
[02:04:04.980 --> 02:04:07.780]   Works great as a photo album that you share with friends.
[02:04:07.780 --> 02:04:11.060]   You have a risk making it too complicated.
[02:04:11.060 --> 02:04:12.060]   I agree.
[02:04:12.060 --> 02:04:15.860]   I think they're taking a big risk, but that's what Facebook does.
[02:04:15.860 --> 02:04:17.660]   They take a lot of risks.
[02:04:17.660 --> 02:04:23.020]   They do things which are not very appealing to their customers.
[02:04:23.020 --> 02:04:24.260]   And they will...
[02:04:24.260 --> 02:04:26.460]   And a lot of it's copying stuff, right?
[02:04:26.460 --> 02:04:27.940]   They've gone this one time.
[02:04:27.940 --> 02:04:32.460]   Yeah, I mean, they have not been able to invent a single new internet behavior.
[02:04:32.460 --> 02:04:33.460]   Right.
[02:04:33.460 --> 02:04:37.340]   So it doesn't matter whether you copy it or not.
[02:04:37.340 --> 02:04:42.740]   That's the power of being a big platform is that you can copy and hope that it will work.
[02:04:42.740 --> 02:04:47.740]   So actually, they did a pretty decent job of this new app.
[02:04:47.740 --> 02:04:55.540]   I'm not a big fan of having two different things at the same time, like Snapchat and
[02:04:55.540 --> 02:04:57.580]   Instagram at the same time.
[02:04:57.580 --> 02:05:02.900]   But it's still a pretty decent job of producing an app.
[02:05:02.900 --> 02:05:04.140]   Let's see how it goes.
[02:05:04.140 --> 02:05:11.940]   I still like to use Snapchat because it only has few of my friends and I'm happy to share
[02:05:11.940 --> 02:05:20.460]   with them all my personal stuff and not just randomly share it with all these like 20,000
[02:05:20.460 --> 02:05:25.060]   plus people who follow me on Instagram.
[02:05:25.060 --> 02:05:28.740]   So for me, that's definitely an added advantage.
[02:05:28.740 --> 02:05:32.860]   Privacy is an added advantage on Snapchat.
[02:05:32.860 --> 02:05:37.740]   Last week, we talked about the fact that Theranos founder and CEO Elizabeth Holmes was going
[02:05:37.740 --> 02:05:43.820]   to go into the lion's den, present at the American Association for Clinical Chemistry's
[02:05:43.820 --> 02:05:45.860]   Annual Convention in Philadelphia.
[02:05:45.860 --> 02:05:47.980]   People thought, what's she going to do?
[02:05:47.980 --> 02:05:53.260]   Defend Theranos, which is being investigated now for fraud.
[02:05:53.260 --> 02:05:59.220]   And instead, she pulled a little clickbaitie kind of a bait and switch.
[02:05:59.220 --> 02:06:03.580]   She didn't talk about Theranos' diagnostics, their blood drop diagnostics at all.
[02:06:03.580 --> 02:06:09.260]   They pitched a new technology called the mini lab, a device the company says will be able
[02:06:09.260 --> 02:06:12.740]   to perform blood diagnostics remotely.
[02:06:12.740 --> 02:06:16.660]   It's the next phase of our company, said Elizabeth Holmes.
[02:06:16.660 --> 02:06:19.220]   Wow, that's ballsy.
[02:06:19.220 --> 02:06:23.860]   Would that be the phase that actually works?
[02:06:23.860 --> 02:06:27.100]   You know, I think that's great.
[02:06:27.100 --> 02:06:31.420]   This is jujitsu.
[02:06:31.420 --> 02:06:35.140]   She went in the lion's den and went, "Well, ha, ha."
[02:06:35.140 --> 02:06:39.980]   And, "Phew, did something else?"
[02:06:39.980 --> 02:06:41.260]   I mean, I'm not a fan.
[02:06:41.260 --> 02:06:47.900]   I wouldn't invest in Theranos, but interesting.
[02:06:47.900 --> 02:06:48.900]   Any thoughts?
[02:06:48.900 --> 02:06:49.900]   No.
[02:06:49.900 --> 02:06:55.500]   How about the company that just got approval from the Federal Aeronautics Administration
[02:06:55.500 --> 02:06:59.900]   to go to the moon?
[02:06:59.900 --> 02:07:02.940]   Moon Express just got approval.
[02:07:02.940 --> 02:07:10.820]   Mission approved, they say, to send an unmanned rover to the moon.
[02:07:10.820 --> 02:07:14.740]   The first private company to venture beyond Earth's orbit.
[02:07:14.740 --> 02:07:16.860]   And do they think they'll make money?
[02:07:16.860 --> 02:07:20.380]   I don't think there's any money on the moon.
[02:07:20.380 --> 02:07:23.660]   They want to do commercial lunar exploration.
[02:07:23.660 --> 02:07:25.900]   Maybe there's valuable minerals.
[02:07:25.900 --> 02:07:27.780]   How do you...
[02:07:27.780 --> 02:07:29.900]   The problem is getting them back.
[02:07:29.900 --> 02:07:35.100]   It's easier to get them back than it is to go there in the first place.
[02:07:35.100 --> 02:07:37.660]   Yeah, the gravity's less.
[02:07:37.660 --> 02:07:38.660]   Right.
[02:07:38.660 --> 02:07:42.140]   The real cost is launching, right?
[02:07:42.140 --> 02:07:47.860]   They got mission approval under, from the Secretary of Transportation, and the Federal
[02:07:47.860 --> 02:07:55.340]   Government will help provide supervisory obligations under the Outer Space Treaty.
[02:07:55.340 --> 02:07:56.340]   And they...
[02:07:56.340 --> 02:08:02.300]   I don't know, it's going to be in 2017, the first commercial lunar mission.
[02:08:02.300 --> 02:08:06.020]   I'm not sure that's the technology that's going to really change things.
[02:08:06.020 --> 02:08:11.020]   Well, and I have to say, when I see the picture of the president and CEO of this company,
[02:08:11.020 --> 02:08:15.020]   Bob Richards, I have to wonder...
[02:08:15.020 --> 02:08:21.300]   Is this the man that's going to take us back to the moon, really?
[02:08:21.300 --> 02:08:24.220]   The man with a Zeppelin in his hand?
[02:08:24.220 --> 02:08:29.660]   He's standing in front of course, the big Zeppelin hanger in Mountain View that was
[02:08:29.660 --> 02:08:30.820]   part of NASA Ames.
[02:08:30.820 --> 02:08:32.940]   I think Google now leases it for...
[02:08:32.940 --> 02:08:36.980]   Oh, the humanity of it all.
[02:08:36.980 --> 02:08:43.580]   And with that, and that image in our head, we wrap up this edition.
[02:08:43.580 --> 02:08:47.900]   That was the enough point in your hand, or you just never mind.
[02:08:47.900 --> 02:08:53.460]   Bob Richards, I did think, Leo, about your question about...
[02:08:53.460 --> 02:08:55.060]   Oh, I forgot!
[02:08:55.060 --> 02:08:56.060]   I forgot!
[02:08:56.060 --> 02:08:57.060]   Okay, let's wrap that.
[02:08:57.060 --> 02:08:58.060]   You know, right?
[02:08:58.060 --> 02:09:01.500]   Thank you very much, Philip, for saving me, because I would have gotten home the night
[02:09:01.500 --> 02:09:03.620]   and went, "Oh, I forgot!"
[02:09:03.620 --> 02:09:06.180]   We were going to talk about the next big thing.
[02:09:06.180 --> 02:09:08.620]   So each of you can wrap up the show with your idea.
[02:09:08.620 --> 02:09:12.300]   Where is the next big thing coming from, Philip?
[02:09:12.300 --> 02:09:14.180]   I think we might all say the same thing.
[02:09:14.180 --> 02:09:20.300]   I think the self-driving car, as far off as it is, and the resistance that we're going
[02:09:20.300 --> 02:09:27.620]   to experience getting there, has the potential to disrupt so many things, starting with truck
[02:09:27.620 --> 02:09:28.620]   drivers...
[02:09:28.620 --> 02:09:31.700]   Yeah, and other way to work truck drivers.
[02:09:31.700 --> 02:09:32.700]   Yeah.
[02:09:32.700 --> 02:09:38.980]   More people may be displaced out of work by this than anything if it happens.
[02:09:38.980 --> 02:09:42.940]   And on the other hand, a lot fewer people are going to end up roadkill.
[02:09:42.940 --> 02:09:43.940]   Good point.
[02:09:43.940 --> 02:09:45.900]   So there you go.
[02:09:45.900 --> 02:09:46.980]   You agree, David Corsey?
[02:09:46.980 --> 02:09:49.020]   What's the next big thing?
[02:09:49.020 --> 02:09:51.900]   Security problems, maybe for the election.
[02:09:51.900 --> 02:09:55.020]   Oh, you know, I think you're absolutely right.
[02:09:55.020 --> 02:10:03.540]   Actually, I do believe that the Republican campaign is setting the stage for...
[02:10:03.540 --> 02:10:07.460]   If it doesn't actually happen, we're using a lot of voting machines, which are horrifically
[02:10:07.460 --> 02:10:09.100]   insecure.
[02:10:09.100 --> 02:10:15.060]   And I think we're going to see a drumbeat from Mr. Trump's campaign that the election will
[02:10:15.060 --> 02:10:18.660]   be thrown because of it.
[02:10:18.660 --> 02:10:19.660]   Whether he...
[02:10:19.660 --> 02:10:21.500]   Especially if he doesn't win that election.
[02:10:21.500 --> 02:10:24.060]   Yeah, well, if he wins, I don't think he'll raise the issue.
[02:10:24.060 --> 02:10:29.100]   All he's raising it now, we'll have about 40% of the vote that's going to believe that
[02:10:29.100 --> 02:10:31.380]   the election was stolen from them.
[02:10:31.380 --> 02:10:37.940]   And that is the kind of thing that undermines the democracy really badly.
[02:10:37.940 --> 02:10:38.940]   Who was it?
[02:10:38.940 --> 02:10:39.940]   It was a Bruce Schneier.
[02:10:39.940 --> 02:10:40.940]   One of our great, maybe Brian Krebs.
[02:10:40.940 --> 02:10:48.100]   I think with Schneier, who said, "We must today eliminate electronic voting, the computerized
[02:10:48.100 --> 02:10:50.140]   voting machines.
[02:10:50.140 --> 02:10:56.020]   There's far too many in use and they have far too few security protections, computerized
[02:10:56.020 --> 02:10:57.020]   voting."
[02:10:57.020 --> 02:11:02.380]   And this is interesting from a technologist, but a security expert is a terrible idea.
[02:11:02.380 --> 02:11:06.820]   And we've got the other, it is Bruce Schneier, the security of our election systems.
[02:11:06.820 --> 02:11:12.940]   He called for basically eliminating them now before this becomes an issue.
[02:11:12.940 --> 02:11:15.500]   That's not going to happen, unfortunately.
[02:11:15.500 --> 02:11:19.300]   I think when Trump said the election was rigged, I think he was talking about the electoral
[02:11:19.300 --> 02:11:23.940]   college, not Russian cyber.
[02:11:23.940 --> 02:11:28.340]   Yeah, but it could be, there's a lot of ways to interpret it.
[02:11:28.340 --> 02:11:29.420]   We'll just wait and see what happens.
[02:11:29.420 --> 02:11:31.420]   If he wins, then it's okay.
[02:11:31.420 --> 02:11:35.140]   If he wins, we're all in.
[02:11:35.140 --> 02:11:42.300]   How about you, O'Malley, what do you think is the next place to look for that special paradigm
[02:11:42.300 --> 02:11:43.300]   shift?
[02:11:43.300 --> 02:11:44.700]   I don't know about that.
[02:11:44.700 --> 02:11:53.060]   I think there is still so much more, which can be done with software and all the new
[02:11:53.060 --> 02:11:56.580]   emergent data streams in our planet.
[02:11:56.580 --> 02:12:01.620]   I think we've only started to digitize inanimate objects.
[02:12:01.620 --> 02:12:04.740]   We've just started to index the real world.
[02:12:04.740 --> 02:12:09.300]   Things, we don't even know what will be the next big thing.
[02:12:09.300 --> 02:12:18.220]   All I know is that everything which is in the future offers a massive potential.
[02:12:18.220 --> 02:12:21.700]   I'm talking about potential, not making predictions, I think.
[02:12:21.700 --> 02:12:28.900]   It's hard to predict because by definition, a paradigm shift is unpredictable.
[02:12:28.900 --> 02:12:29.900]   But I agree with you.
[02:12:29.900 --> 02:12:34.580]   I think Skynet is actually the next big thing.
[02:12:34.580 --> 02:12:38.620]   Hold on to your seats because when you get all that data together with a huge massive
[02:12:38.620 --> 02:12:44.980]   computational capabilities, the results may surprise you.
[02:12:44.980 --> 02:12:49.260]   On that clickbaity note, we will wrap up today's show.
[02:12:49.260 --> 02:12:50.260]   What a pleasure.
[02:12:50.260 --> 02:12:53.340]   Always a thrill to have you guys on Philip Elmer DeWitt.
[02:12:53.340 --> 02:12:55.500]   He's at ped30.com.
[02:12:55.500 --> 02:12:57.700]   That's his new Apple 3.0 site going well.
[02:12:57.700 --> 02:13:00.900]   You could subscribe, but he's doing the same thing Ben Thompson does, right?
[02:13:00.900 --> 02:13:02.940]   You were inspired by Ben, I think.
[02:13:02.940 --> 02:13:04.260]   Yeah, a little different.
[02:13:04.260 --> 02:13:05.900]   He does one free post a week.
[02:13:05.900 --> 02:13:07.500]   Mine go free after three days.
[02:13:07.500 --> 02:13:09.380]   Oh, I like that.
[02:13:09.380 --> 02:13:12.220]   If you don't mind reading it a little later, you can read it.
[02:13:12.220 --> 02:13:14.740]   If you want to read the latest, you subscribe.
[02:13:14.740 --> 02:13:16.380]   How much is this subscription?
[02:13:16.380 --> 02:13:17.380]   Ten bucks a month.
[02:13:17.380 --> 02:13:18.820]   Good deal.
[02:13:18.820 --> 02:13:20.700]   Very good deal.
[02:13:20.700 --> 02:13:23.660]   I wish you all the best.
[02:13:23.660 --> 02:13:28.860]   I love seeing, as I did, people leaving the mainstream and creating their own business
[02:13:28.860 --> 02:13:29.860]   out of it.
[02:13:29.860 --> 02:13:31.980]   I think that's definitely the way to go.
[02:13:31.980 --> 02:13:32.980]   Thank you Philip.
[02:13:32.980 --> 02:13:33.980]   My pleasure.
[02:13:33.980 --> 02:13:37.140]   David Corsi has nothing to promote, nothing to plug.
[02:13:37.140 --> 02:13:39.340]   He just comes on out of the goodness of his own heart.
[02:13:39.340 --> 02:13:40.660]   It's always a great pleasure.
[02:13:40.660 --> 02:13:41.940]   Oh, I know.
[02:13:41.940 --> 02:13:44.700]   You want a microphone.
[02:13:44.700 --> 02:13:49.140]   I will live with how the microphone, obviously I have one.
[02:13:49.140 --> 02:13:50.860]   I'll send you one.
[02:13:50.860 --> 02:13:51.940]   Do come back soon.
[02:13:51.940 --> 02:13:52.940]   Really nothing at all.
[02:13:52.940 --> 02:13:54.780]   Do you want to?
[02:13:54.780 --> 02:13:55.780]   Not right now.
[02:13:55.780 --> 02:13:56.780]   I'm working on something.
[02:13:56.780 --> 02:14:00.500]   And gee, gee, I'm hireable, but I'm working on stuff.
[02:14:00.500 --> 02:14:02.500]   I like working on something.
[02:14:02.500 --> 02:14:07.060]   You can follow him on Twitter @techinsider.
[02:14:07.060 --> 02:14:09.540]   Except I don't Twitter very much.
[02:14:09.540 --> 02:14:11.420]   I'm not a big Twitter fan.
[02:14:11.420 --> 02:14:14.260]   Well, then forget it.
[02:14:14.260 --> 02:14:15.260]   I don't either.
[02:14:15.260 --> 02:14:16.260]   You're not finding me on Facebook.
[02:14:16.260 --> 02:14:19.780]   I respond to people on Twitter once in a while, but I just don't spend a lot of time
[02:14:19.780 --> 02:14:20.780]   there anymore.
[02:14:20.780 --> 02:14:23.220]   It's not where I'm watching the Olympics.
[02:14:23.220 --> 02:14:24.900]   Let's put it that way.
[02:14:24.900 --> 02:14:26.460]   I talked to you on Facebook.
[02:14:26.460 --> 02:14:27.460]   Yeah, Facebook.
[02:14:27.460 --> 02:14:29.300]   I respond to Facebook messages, actually.
[02:14:29.300 --> 02:14:30.300]   Yes, you do.
[02:14:30.300 --> 02:14:31.300]   Yeah.
[02:14:31.300 --> 02:14:32.300]   Nothing else.
[02:14:32.300 --> 02:14:33.300]   Don't try to talk.
[02:14:33.300 --> 02:14:34.300]   Thank you.
[02:14:34.300 --> 02:14:35.300]   It's always good to see you, David.
[02:14:35.300 --> 02:14:36.300]   Thank you.
[02:14:36.300 --> 02:14:37.300]   Good evening.
[02:14:37.300 --> 02:14:39.300]   Let's hear a little bit more about pi.co.
[02:14:39.300 --> 02:14:40.540]   That's own Malek's blog.
[02:14:40.540 --> 02:14:43.940]   I didn't know about it, but you've been interviewing some great people.
[02:14:43.940 --> 02:14:44.940]   Yeah.
[02:14:44.940 --> 02:14:53.220]   I just feel that after being immersed in tech for so long, I wanted to interview people
[02:14:53.220 --> 02:15:05.100]   whose professions or whose ideas bring together architecture, culture, and technology together.
[02:15:05.100 --> 02:15:07.780]   This has been a fun series of...
[02:15:07.780 --> 02:15:14.220]   Legileum is the guy who taught me a lot about logistics and Chris taught me, Chris Young,
[02:15:14.220 --> 02:15:16.140]   which is the latest interview.
[02:15:16.140 --> 02:15:22.460]   He taught me a lot about the future of food and kitchen and what connected kitchen looks
[02:15:22.460 --> 02:15:26.100]   like in the future, and so we and stuff like that.
[02:15:26.100 --> 02:15:27.500]   He's a chef.
[02:15:27.500 --> 02:15:31.820]   He's also an inventor, and he wrote a book called The Modernist Cuisine.
[02:15:31.820 --> 02:15:38.620]   It's just great, great people I get to interview and have smart conversations with.
[02:15:38.620 --> 02:15:40.780]   There is no real agenda behind it.
[02:15:40.780 --> 02:15:44.620]   I just like doing these conversations with smart people.
[02:15:44.620 --> 02:15:46.420]   This is not a web.
[02:15:46.420 --> 02:15:54.380]   It's not my publication.
[02:15:54.380 --> 02:15:55.380]   I love doing triangulation.
[02:15:55.380 --> 02:15:58.820]   One of the reasons I love doing this show, it's really great to get together with interesting
[02:15:58.820 --> 02:16:03.260]   people with great minds and just talk.
[02:16:03.260 --> 02:16:04.660]   There's a lot to be said for that.
[02:16:04.660 --> 02:16:08.260]   Yeah, I don't really professionally write anymore.
[02:16:08.260 --> 02:16:12.220]   I don't want to make advertising as source of income ever again.
[02:16:12.220 --> 02:16:18.100]   I think it hurts my thinking and I don't want to be part of it.
[02:16:18.100 --> 02:16:22.380]   But I write for the New Yorker now, which is really a lot of fun.
[02:16:22.380 --> 02:16:24.300]   And the editors are amazing.
[02:16:24.300 --> 02:16:30.500]   They've taught me new ways to think about things and how to write better.
[02:16:30.500 --> 02:16:31.980]   That is fun.
[02:16:31.980 --> 02:16:39.180]   But I really, really, Pico is where I put a lot of personal spare time into.
[02:16:39.180 --> 02:16:42.980]   I'm going to start doing a podcast in a couple of weeks.
[02:16:42.980 --> 02:16:45.540]   It'll be called PicoCast.
[02:16:45.540 --> 02:16:46.620]   Same interviews you read.
[02:16:46.620 --> 02:16:49.740]   I will also have them in audio form as well.
[02:16:49.740 --> 02:16:50.980]   I'm excited about that.
[02:16:50.980 --> 02:16:52.220]   Welcome to the club.
[02:16:52.220 --> 02:16:53.220]   That's great.
[02:16:53.220 --> 02:16:57.220]   I'm learning from you, Leo.
[02:16:57.220 --> 02:16:58.220]   I know you're not.
[02:16:58.220 --> 02:16:59.460]   But okay, thank you for saying that.
[02:16:59.460 --> 02:17:00.820]   But I'm really glad you're doing it.
[02:17:00.820 --> 02:17:02.020]   I think that's fabulous.
[02:17:02.020 --> 02:17:05.740]   Will people, if they go to pi.co, find out about the podcast when it comes out?
[02:17:05.740 --> 02:17:06.980]   Yes, they will.
[02:17:06.980 --> 02:17:12.820]   And hopefully, I'll send you a link and maybe you can offer some feedback as well.
[02:17:12.820 --> 02:17:15.220]   And you can come back anytime, all three of you.
[02:17:15.220 --> 02:17:16.980]   Always a pleasure.
[02:17:16.980 --> 02:17:18.220]   We do try a trying.
[02:17:18.220 --> 02:17:23.900]   We do Twitch every Sunday afternoon, 3 p.m. Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern time.
[02:17:23.900 --> 02:17:25.420]   That's 2,200 UTC.
[02:17:25.420 --> 02:17:28.020]   If you want to watch live, you certainly are invited to.
[02:17:28.020 --> 02:17:31.780]   We have a live stream on our website, twitter.tv/live.
[02:17:31.780 --> 02:17:35.180]   We have a secondary stream with a different player for people who have trouble with that
[02:17:35.180 --> 02:17:37.540]   when it's live.twitch.tv.
[02:17:37.540 --> 02:17:45.500]   You can also watch live on, there are a lot of platforms for watching live on Apple TV,
[02:17:45.500 --> 02:17:48.860]   on Roku, pretty much anywhere you want to be.
[02:17:48.860 --> 02:17:50.220]   Just look for the Twitch app.
[02:17:50.220 --> 02:17:51.700]   There are many, many Twitch apps out there.
[02:17:51.700 --> 02:17:52.700]   We didn't write any of them.
[02:17:52.700 --> 02:17:56.660]   I just thank our great community for writing those.
[02:17:56.660 --> 02:18:00.700]   If you're watching live, you should join us in the chatroom too, IRC.tv.
[02:18:00.700 --> 02:18:02.940]   Part be part of the conversation.
[02:18:02.940 --> 02:18:04.620]   It's always great to have you there.
[02:18:04.620 --> 02:18:05.620]   You can even be in studio.
[02:18:05.620 --> 02:18:09.220]   We have a live studio audience, a nice studio audience this week.
[02:18:09.220 --> 02:18:10.900]   Just email tickets@twit.tv.
[02:18:10.900 --> 02:18:12.660]   Make sure we get a share out for you.
[02:18:12.660 --> 02:18:20.260]   You do want to do that because we only have how many more weeks here?
[02:18:20.260 --> 02:18:22.620]   One more week in the studio?
[02:18:22.620 --> 02:18:24.100]   Yesterday we had a couple come by.
[02:18:24.100 --> 02:18:25.460]   They said, "We're sorry, we're late."
[02:18:25.460 --> 02:18:27.340]   We went to the new studio.
[02:18:27.340 --> 02:18:29.620]   That was a little premature, but we are moving.
[02:18:29.620 --> 02:18:32.540]   Our first show from the new studio will be August 21.
[02:18:32.540 --> 02:18:34.740]   The new studio is still in Petaluma.
[02:18:34.740 --> 02:18:35.860]   It's just a few miles from here.
[02:18:35.860 --> 02:18:37.260]   It's not far.
[02:18:37.260 --> 02:18:38.340]   We could give you directions.
[02:18:38.340 --> 02:18:43.460]   If you email tickets@twit.tv, we can make sure you get here and that we have a place
[02:18:43.460 --> 02:18:44.620]   for you to sit.
[02:18:44.620 --> 02:18:46.540]   I don't yet really know how big it will be.
[02:18:46.540 --> 02:18:50.460]   I think my sense is we could easily get the same size audience in there, but we'll have
[02:18:50.460 --> 02:18:51.460]   to...
[02:18:51.460 --> 02:18:52.460]   Well, we don't know yet.
[02:18:52.460 --> 02:18:54.620]   We have to see.
[02:18:54.620 --> 02:19:00.100]   Again, we're going to be here on the 14th, and that's going to be the next week, the
[02:19:00.100 --> 02:19:02.860]   last Twit in the Brick House studios.
[02:19:02.860 --> 02:19:07.100]   We will be in the East Side studios, the new East Side studios starting on the 21st of
[02:19:07.100 --> 02:19:11.620]   August 2016.
[02:19:11.620 --> 02:19:16.580]   This is the Petaluma Show, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:19:16.580 --> 02:19:20.740]   We're just looking for ways to use that word in an English sentence.
[02:19:20.740 --> 02:19:22.980]   Thank you all for being here.
[02:19:22.980 --> 02:19:26.460]   Of course, if you can't be here and you get confused about the time or where we are,
[02:19:26.460 --> 02:19:27.460]   it doesn't really matter.
[02:19:27.460 --> 02:19:28.460]   We're on the internet.
[02:19:28.460 --> 02:19:29.460]   Just subscribe.
