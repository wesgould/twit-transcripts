[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.240]   the week's tech news.
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.720]   And we have a great panel to get things underway here.
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.400]   Earl Malek is joining us, the founder of Gigahome.
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.400]   He's at home.co.
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.560]   And venture capitalists these days.
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.480]   You hid your bobblehead.
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.920]   Now he's just peering out at us even more creepily.
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.840]   How come-- is that a New York Yankees?
[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.280]   That's right.
[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.560]   Why do you have a Yankees bobblehead?
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:45.600]   Because I like the Yankees.
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.920]   Oh, all right.
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:48.420]   See?
[00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:49.240]   That's nice.
[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.920]   Did they award you that on the field?
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.040]   I wish now is from a friend.
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.680]   That's nice.
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.600]   I like how he's just peering out around the corner.
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.440]   Also with us from imore.com, Georgia Dow.
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.280]   She's a senior editor there and the host of the Vectorcast.
[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.480]   Hi, Georgia.
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.480]   Hello.
[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.000]   Great to see you.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.920]   Thank you for having me back.
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:10.880]   Always a pleasure.
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.600]   Nice to see you again.
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.080]   And we have a newbie in our midst.
[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.200]   Greg Farrow joins us.
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.840]   He's the host of packet pushers at packet pushers.net.
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.240]   And you'll find him on the Twitter at etherealmine.
[00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.440]   Hey, Greg.
[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:25.560]   How you doing, Leo?
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.080]   Joining us.
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.360]   Thanks very much for having me on the show.
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.040]   Joining us from Midlothian.
[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.280]   No, we're--
[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.640]   Chiltonum in the UK.
[00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.880]   Chiltonum.
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.320]   Chiltonum.
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.320]   Very nice to have all of you here.
[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.120]   Also joining us just for the little bit at the beginning.
[00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.760]   Steve Gibson, our security guy.
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.160]   Steve has been following closely, kind of waiting
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.680]   for the other shoe to drop on this encryption thing.
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.960]   Of course, as we all know, the Department of Justice
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.080]   dropped their suit against Apple, saying, never mind.
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.680]   We got it.
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:59.520]   We figured it out.
[00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:00.080]   No problem.
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.760]   They've also admitted that they only
[00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:06.040]   can do it with older iPhones, that they cannot decrypt newer
[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.440]   iPhones.
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.720]   And Steve, just to kind of get people up to date,
[00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.680]   you were at one point working on your own crypto program,
[00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:15.640]   were you?
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:16.440]   Right.
[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.880]   I had laid out all of the architecture
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.880]   for a VPN called CryptoLink, which
[00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.640]   was going to make it super simple.
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.600]   Basically, solve a lot of the annoyances and problems
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.240]   that people have, for example, configuring and setting up
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.840]   open VPN, and then also using it in the real world
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.600]   by simultaneously sending packets out
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.680]   to attempt to open multiple ports to find a way out
[00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.040]   of a local network over to the VPN server and a bunch of stuff.
[00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.880]   But thanks to the Security Now podcast every week
[00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:55.040]   and our continual looking at what was going on a few years ago,
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.440]   I was sort of reading the tea leaves.
[00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.320]   And I decided to suspend that whole project,
[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:07.240]   because it became clear to me that the whole question of whether we
[00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:12.040]   were going to ultimately be allowed to have truly
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:16.720]   unbreakable encrypted communications was still not
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.440]   a settled issue.
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.360]   And of course, shortly after you decided not to do crypto
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:28.480]   locker, we, Lidar Levison of Lava Bit, abruptly went out
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:29.080]   of business.
[00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.760]   We found out later because the FBI had insisted
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:35.880]   that he hand over the keys to all of his customers
[00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:39.080]   in encrypted email in an attempt to find Edward Snowden
[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.800]   at the time.
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.280]   And so we've seen this happen before.
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.640]   And on the show on Wednesday on Security Now on Wednesday--
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:50.680]   or Tuesday, I should say, Steve and I were talking about Senate
[00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.680]   action.
[00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.760]   It's been widely considered at some point
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:58.400]   that the Congress would weigh in on this, an attempt in some way
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.280]   to give law enforcement access to encrypted data.
[00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.720]   Well, we've been waiting for Richard Burr, who's chairman
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.520]   of the Senate Intelligence Committee.
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.240]   He's a Republican from North Carolina
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:14.160]   to release the text of a bill that they're calling
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.000]   Feinstein Burr.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.320]   And we got what is apparently a draft of that on Thursday.
[00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.560]   Have you looked at the Feinstein Burr?
[00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:24.080]   I have.
[00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.120]   And we should also remember that this is what Tim Cook wanted
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.200]   to.
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:32.720]   His rejection was that this is too important an issue
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:37.400]   to just have some judge write a court order out of the blue
[00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:41.600]   and attempt to compel Apple to create code in order
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:45.360]   to give the FBI a wedge into a phone that they had.
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.800]   Tim wanted--
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.880]   said, look, this needs to be resolved one way or the other.
[00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.440]   We don't want to break the law.
[00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:55.960]   But we also don't want to just capitulate to something
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:57.560]   that we feel is wrong.
[00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:01.360]   So ultimately, I think it's clear to all of us
[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:04.000]   that it's not clear how far up it's
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.600]   going to go that legislation of some kind
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:12.760]   to resolve what are the legal obligations of someone
[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:18.760]   providing encryption, where that-- what the limits are.
[00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:23.080]   There is a bill in the California State Assembly moving along.
[00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:25.240]   And then, of course, up at the national level,
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:28.440]   we've got, as you said, this Feinstein Burr bill.
[00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:36.440]   And it is as bad as sweeping as it could possibly be.
[00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:38.880]   It doesn't-- and it's actually it's
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:42.600]   what I've been talking about on the Security Now podcast
[00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:47.240]   for weeks, sort of expecting something that unfortunately
[00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:48.280]   looks like this.
[00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:52.040]   It doesn't outlaw encryption, but it
[00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:56.760]   provides a law to compel decryption.
[00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:58.400]   So the name of the bill-- and by the way,
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:01.080]   we should mention this is a draft text released for comment.
[00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:02.720]   So we're commenting.
[00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:04.720]   I don't think Richard Burr wants our comments.
[00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:06.280]   But it's because we have to sign it into law.
[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:07.400]   So we have a lot of--
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:10.200]   He's kind of indicated that he's somewhat on the side of--
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:11.920]   I think everybody in law enforcement
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:13.440]   and many in government are concerned
[00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:16.880]   about this going dark problem, this problem of criminals
[00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:19.720]   being able to use strong encryption to essentially go dark,
[00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:24.800]   to go off the net, but still communicate.
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:27.120]   The name of this bill might tell you something.
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:32.000]   The Compliance with Court Orders Act of 2016--
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.680]   it's not very long, which is good.
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:34.440]   It's easy to read.
[00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:35.760]   It's nine pages.
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:37.480]   Again, this is not in committee.
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:41.600]   This is just a draft that Burr is circulating
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:44.080]   so people will comment on it.
[00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:47.640]   But boy, oh boy, here's a comment from Kevin Bankston.
[00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:50.440]   He's the director of New America Foundation's Open Technology
[00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:50.880]   Institute.
[00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:53.560]   He says, I got to say, in my nearly 20 years of work
[00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:58.800]   in tech policy, this is easily the most ludicrous, dangerous,
[00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:02.880]   and technically illiterate proposal I've ever seen.
[00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:05.680]   What is the proposal, Steve?
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:14.440]   So it essentially says that anyone who encrypts communications
[00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:18.320]   and they define that very broadly to be both in flight
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:23.960]   and encrypted storage must provide a means
[00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:28.240]   to provide intelligible, is the word they use throughout,
[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:33.000]   an intelligible, i.e. decrypted version of whatever
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.040]   it is that the Court orders.
[00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:38.240]   And they use the term covered entity
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:40.800]   and then define it to mean--
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:42.480]   and I'm reading from the bill--
[00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:46.200]   the term covered entity, that is to say,
[00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:51.040]   who this applies to means a device manufacturer,
[00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:54.760]   a software manufacturer, an electronic communication
[00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:57.920]   service, a remote computing service,
[00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:02.200]   a provider of wire or electronic communication service,
[00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:05.240]   a provider of a remote computing service,
[00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:06.760]   or get this.
[00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:11.960]   Any person who provides a product or method
[00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:15.600]   to facilitate a communication or the processing
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:17.320]   of storage of data.
[00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:20.440]   So it's essentially everything and everyone.
[00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:24.240]   Yeah, the professor of law at George Washington Law School
[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:28.160]   or in Kerr said that this would apply to Apple's App Store
[00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:31.320]   and Google's Play Store and the Windows App Store.
[00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:33.560]   So anybody who's providing software
[00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:36.240]   would be required upon Court Order
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:40.120]   to give up all of the information unencrypted.
[00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:43.280]   Or somebody posting something on GitHub.
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:44.920]   I mean, it's that broad.
[00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:48.560]   It's not just commercial entities.
[00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:51.360]   It's any person who provides a product or method
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:53.920]   to facilitate a communication or the processing
[00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:55.760]   or storage of data.
[00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:59.200]   Now, by the way, Matthew Green, our favorite crypto guy
[00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:02.320]   from Johns Hopkins, says the White House declined
[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:05.240]   to endorse Feinstein-Burger.
[00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:07.280]   But he said they took a complex issue
[00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:11.200]   and arrived at the most naive possible solution.
[00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:13.520]   This would mean, essentially, that anybody doing business
[00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:15.600]   in the United States would have to have a backdoor.
[00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:16.880]   It doesn't say backdoor.
[00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:21.440]   In fact, Burr said this is just a performance proposal.
[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:24.080]   It doesn't say how you have to do it.
[00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:26.720]   It just says that you have to have a way to do it.
[00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:27.240]   Exactly.
[00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:28.840]   And that's what we expected.
[00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:32.520]   And I caution everyone to be careful about terminology
[00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:34.880]   because terminology matters.
[00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:37.880]   And so no one mentions backdoor.
[00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:41.640]   And a backdoor brings with it a negative connotation.
[00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:50.320]   So all it says is that, for example, Apple would have to build
[00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:56.960]   in to their technology a means to allow if they receive
[00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:59.120]   an order from a government.
[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:02.440]   Now, that's the other really scary thing here is this says
[00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:04.440]   a government.
[00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:08.240]   But they're not talking about non-US governments.
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:13.720]   They're talking about all government entities within the US,
[00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:15.600]   states and counties.
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:19.480]   And so it's not just law enforcement at the federal level
[00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:22.960]   or some Supreme Court order.
[00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:26.040]   It's some government official down the street
[00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:30.040]   can apparently compel this sort of decryption.
[00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:35.400]   The EFF says, despite being in a golden age of surveillance--
[00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:37.200]   I mean, that's the other side of this is that--
[00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:37.760]   Yeah.
[00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:41.080]   Right now, it's only going to get better thanks
[00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:41.920]   to the internet of things.
[00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:45.120]   They can surveil us in all sorts of new and unusual ways
[00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:47.400]   despite being a golden age of surveillance.
[00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:49.960]   The senators are pushing Congress to destroy
[00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:54.320]   fundamental aspects of computer security.
[00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:59.120]   This doesn't just open a door for law enforcement
[00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:01.120]   to keep up on criminals.
[00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:06.360]   It opens a door for criminals to invade us.
[00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:09.040]   And they go on to say, forcing companies to undermine
[00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:11.040]   their products will stifle the very innovation that
[00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:13.440]   built the American tech industry.
[00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:18.960]   And I can't imagine that this would become law or even end up.
[00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:21.280]   But it's so important that we not sit back and say,
[00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:23.200]   oh, that couldn't happen.
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:24.240]   Go to the EFF.
[00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:28.680]   They have an action page that will give you the name, address
[00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:32.640]   of your Congress critter if you're in the United States.
[00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:35.320]   And you can write to them--
[00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:39.640]   I strongly suggest you either phone them or write to them
[00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:42.880]   using snail mail so they can verify you're a constituent
[00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:46.360]   and register your feelings about this.
[00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:48.680]   I'm not going to tell you how to feel, although I think you
[00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:51.240]   could tell how Stephen and I feel about it--
[00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:53.000]   but register your feelings about this.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.120]   Because this is something that's going to come to a head
[00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:56.960]   pretty quickly, I think.
[00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:59.600]   It says, here, the term government,
[00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:04.080]   as defined in this document, meaning that the government
[00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:08.000]   can compel, means the government of the United States
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.160]   and the government of the District of Columbia
[00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:14.760]   or any Commonwealth territory or possession
[00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:18.040]   of the United States of an Indian tribe
[00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:22.360]   or of any state or political subdivision thereof.
[00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:23.400]   So the city council--
[00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:25.040]   Meaning, yes, exactly.
[00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:27.240]   Meaning the mayor down the street.
[00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:28.320]   Wow.
[00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:28.920]   All right, Steve.
[00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:30.960]   I knew that you had a--
[00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:33.120]   he says he had a Google Alert set.
[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:36.280]   That anything happened with Feinstein Burr, he would--
[00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:37.480]   He would have been going crazy.
[00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:39.120]   Yeah, but it's going crazy.
[00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:41.440]   But remember, this is a good time for you to weigh in,
[00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:46.760]   because this draft proposal is designed to get conversation.
[00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:50.640]   And now's the time for you to let your Congress critter know
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:51.560]   how you feel, boy.
[00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:52.880]   We'll talk to him more on Tuesday.
[00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:53.440]   Thank you, Steve.
[00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:55.280]   Steve gives him the host of security now.
[00:14:55.280 --> 00:15:00.240]   Every Tuesday, 130 Pacific, 430 Eastern, 2030 UTC.
[00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:05.520]   Greg Farrow, the UK, had the Snoopers charter, right?
[00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:06.040]   Yeah.
[00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:07.040]   Similarly--
[00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:07.560]   Yeah.
[00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:09.960]   It's very similar in the sense that the Snoopers charter
[00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:11.200]   in the UK is based--
[00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:12.560]   we don't have a bill of rights here.
[00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:16.040]   So as a citizen or as a part of society here,
[00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:19.320]   you don't get the rights that you get in the US
[00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:21.840]   through your bill of rights or in your constitution.
[00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:24.000]   So we don't actually have some of the privileges
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.840]   that you have.
[00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:29.800]   And the Snoopers charter was basically just reinforcing
[00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:31.520]   the existing law that you have no rights,
[00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:33.920]   and the government has the right to take whatever it likes.
[00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:34.960]   Great.
[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:36.320]   And is that the law?
[00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:38.240]   It's the draft communications data bill.
[00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:39.200]   It was proposed.
[00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:40.480]   The Snoopers charter--
[00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:42.320]   sorry, the Snoopers charter has had
[00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:44.960]   a substantial amount of resistance in the community.
[00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:47.560]   People have been pushing back very, very hard.
[00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:50.360]   And to the point where the governments had to shelve it
[00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:52.880]   for now, there are other political things that
[00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:54.320]   have taken it off the agenda.
[00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:56.640]   But I expect it to come back in a year or two.
[00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:58.200]   The British government--
[00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:01.160]   I mean, I think one of the things that I don't think people
[00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:03.800]   are talking about in this debate is the reason why the government
[00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:05.360]   wants to be able to decrypt.
[00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:07.200]   And it comes down to money.
[00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:09.400]   The ability to use--
[00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:12.280]   to have a backdoor or to have unencrypted data
[00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:15.800]   is the cheapest possible way of implementing government.
[00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:18.560]   And as our governments keep making commitments
[00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:20.520]   to people to spend less and less on tax--
[00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:23.040]   to take less and less tax and spend less on
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:25.520]   and have small government, they need cheaper and cheaper
[00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:26.720]   forms of law and for.
[00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:31.880]   This is a response to budget crunches.
[00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:32.680]   Automated Snoopers.
[00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:35.720]   If you follow the money, you'll always
[00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:37.640]   get to the truth at the end of the day.
[00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:40.080]   So the cheapest way that they can collect data, of course,
[00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:42.880]   is to get access to unencrypted data sources.
[00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:46.360]   And the FBI, of course, needs to do more with less.
[00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:48.000]   And so the cheapest way that it could do it
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.600]   is to have these cases.
[00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:51.040]   Now, of course, they will always win
[00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:54.440]   if the encryptions gets really, really tough.
[00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:55.600]   They can go back to the government
[00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:56.760]   and ask for more money.
[00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:58.680]   So I just see it as cheap money.
[00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:00.120]   Yeah.
[00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:00.640]   Oh, man.
[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:02.360]   And one other thing about this bill, if I can--
[00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:02.860]   Sure.
[00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:03.360]   Yes, correct.
[00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:05.000]   --is it also--
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.240]   perhaps the most egregious part about this
[00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:10.080]   is the part where it says people must not obfuscate
[00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:12.080]   or encrypt the metadata.
[00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:14.800]   So that is people must not only render up the data,
[00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:17.520]   but they must render up all the metadata around it.
[00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:19.080]   Well, I think that's what the EFF meant
[00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:20.920]   that we're in a golden age of surveillance,
[00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:24.640]   because that metadata not only is widely available,
[00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:26.640]   it can be-- at least in the United States,
[00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:28.360]   you can get it without a warrant.
[00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:33.480]   So it's-- you just-- in fact, every carrier in the United
[00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:36.480]   States has a portal for law enforcement
[00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:37.840]   that they can log into.
[00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:40.960]   And for a small fee, a few dollars
[00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:44.040]   get location information information
[00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:45.360]   about who you call.
[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:47.640]   They can't get the content, but they can get everything else,
[00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:49.440]   all the so-called metadata.
[00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:52.200]   And in many cases, that's sufficient.
[00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:54.600]   I think the secret here is that during the second
[00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:57.800]   World War, when Bletchley Park cracked the enigma code--
[00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:00.560]   I'm sure everybody's heard about the enigma code and so forth.
[00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:04.240]   But while Alan Turing was the guy who cracked the enigma code,
[00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:05.600]   what a lot of people don't know is there's
[00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:09.240]   a guy called Gordon Welchman, who actually had spent five years
[00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:11.360]   ahead of that collecting metadata.
[00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:14.520]   That is, they had actually been analyzing the Morse code
[00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:15.960]   that people had been using.
[00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:18.880]   And they were able to identify which operator was talking.
[00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:20.520]   So each of the operators had a signal--
[00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:21.800]   By their hand, wow.
[00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:24.040]   By their hand on the Morse code, exactly.
[00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:26.080]   And this Gordon Welchman was actually
[00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:30.160]   able to build a massive library of metadata around who and when,
[00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:32.760]   so that when they finally cracked the code with the enigma
[00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:36.600]   machine, they were able to say, oh, that operator is sending
[00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:37.560]   that data.
[00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:40.640]   Then sort of reference to what they knew about the operator
[00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:42.200]   and where they were to say, yes, this
[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:44.320]   is valid viable crack data.
[00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:47.280]   So the metadata is at least as-- or perhaps more important
[00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:48.440]   than actually the unencrypted data.
[00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:50.080]   And this bill, when you read it says,
[00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:52.360]   it is illegal to obfuscate the metadata.
[00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:55.120]   That is, illegal to hide IP addresses,
[00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:57.400]   illegal to hide you as the user, that things like that.
[00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:00.520]   That worries me much more, even then the fact
[00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:02.840]   that there's no limits on what the court can ask for.
[00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:06.000]   Imagine a court going to Amazon and saying, give me all
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.720]   of your data.
[00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:08.560]   Right.
[00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:09.640]   Not just one person.
[00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:12.240]   I want anybody in the whole data center.
[00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:13.200]   I want to see it all.
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:14.440]   Right.
[00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:15.440]   Oh, and what is this--
[00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:20.400]   I mean, as an investor, this must cause some concern
[00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:23.760]   because this certainly would impact business in the United
[00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:26.040]   States.
[00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:28.520]   So I haven't really had enough time
[00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:31.720]   to look through the exact documentation.
[00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:34.720]   But from the-- from the--
[00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:39.840]   what I've read on the web more than how I have thought about it,
[00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:42.080]   this is still early days.
[00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:44.960]   There's a lot more debate which needs to go on.
[00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:49.560]   And I think we need to be very careful when, in terms
[00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:54.400]   of making decisions around encryption and decryption
[00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:58.240]   from a business standpoint as well as security standpoint.
[00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:01.760]   I think everything is happening in the dark.
[00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:04.000]   And I think that is a bigger challenge right now
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.520]   for the whole whole community, especially
[00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:10.240]   in the investor community, is that no one really knows
[00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:13.880]   what is happening and why the decisions are being made.
[00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:18.240]   So I think we still need a little more healthy debate
[00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:20.160]   around this whole topic.
[00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:24.760]   And you see more and more conversation around it.
[00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:27.520]   Yeah, my concern, if you're Apple computer,
[00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:29.760]   you don't-- in a law like this sort of past,
[00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:32.240]   you don't really-- you would have no choice except--
[00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:35.520]   I mean, if you either would give in, which I think they'd
[00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:38.840]   have to, or you'd have to leave the country,
[00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:40.360]   I don't think that's an option.
[00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:43.560]   And by the way, where would you go?
[00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:44.080]   Indeed.
[00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:46.480]   And I think the biggest challenge we have right now
[00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:53.520]   is that most people look at technology as a geographic--
[00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:55.560]   like companies are geographic entities,
[00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:58.800]   or services as geo-local entities.
[00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:02.760]   And that's not really the case because we are--
[00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:05.680]   we live in a world which is kind of bottomless.
[00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:09.080]   So Apple is not just a US company.
[00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:12.200]   It is not just a Chinese company.
[00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:13.520]   It's all over the world.
[00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:17.200]   And so each decision has a bigger implication.
[00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:21.520]   I think that part of the decision-making process
[00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:22.640]   isn't really there.
[00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:27.640]   Nobody actually thinks about the larger global implications
[00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:29.160]   just yet.
[00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:30.080]   I just--
[00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:31.120]   Yeah.
[00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:32.760]   Go ahead, Jordan.
[00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:34.120]   I think you're absolutely right.
[00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:36.400]   I think that the problem is that many people--
[00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:38.360]   encryption is a really scary word.
[00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:40.480]   And I don't think that a lot of people understand--
[00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:41.920]   probably most of the people that listen to this show
[00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:44.080]   understand why it's so important.
[00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:47.520]   But I think that for many people, technology is really scary.
[00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:49.520]   And even the people that are writing these bills--
[00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:52.600]   after you read them, you can say it's almost like kids writing
[00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:54.520]   a wish list with a stand-up.
[00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:56.160]   They don't know how they're doing it.
[00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:58.040]   They're just hoping for it.
[00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:00.720]   And it's like if you've ever seen any horror film,
[00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:01.440]   they're like, you know what?
[00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:03.200]   I'm just going to open the door to this box,
[00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:04.560]   even though I don't know what's going to happen.
[00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:06.360]   And we're opening Pandora's box a little bit
[00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:07.840]   so the good guys can get in.
[00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:09.880]   But that means that everybody can get in.
[00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:12.320]   And I think that we need to have these discussions
[00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:14.240]   to help people understand what is encryption,
[00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:15.720]   why is it so important?
[00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:17.920]   Because the government has been using
[00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:21.000]   very insightful, emotional arguments,
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.040]   saying we have to catch the bad guys.
[00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:26.840]   But this actually also lets the bad guys catch us.
[00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:32.200]   Yeah, I think that's the point I think Tim Cook tried to make.
[00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:34.440]   You know, in some ways, this is--
[00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:38.040]   I think the release of this draft document
[00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:41.520]   is not-- the burn knows better than to think
[00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:43.440]   that this can become law.
[00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:46.880]   It's just right now, the Senate, it's too contentious.
[00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:53.160]   And there's no certainty that the president would sign it.
[00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:54.800]   This president or the next president.
[00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:56.040]   So I think really--
[00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:59.000]   Don't say that that's why it's so insightful is that they
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:00.960]   ask for like $100,000.
[00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:04.360]   I'm like, Leo, I want to loan for $100,000.
[00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:06.120]   And you're like, Georgia, there's no way I'm giving you
[00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:07.120]   a $100,000.
[00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:08.320]   I don't even know you.
[00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:09.520]   And then I come back with one.
[00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:11.000]   I'm just OK, just $1,000.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.320]   You're like, well, OK, in comparison,
[00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:14.840]   this seems pretty fair.
[00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:15.960]   And then that gets signed into law.
[00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:19.080]   I also think it's more than just saying, oh, then we'll settle
[00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:19.480]   for less.
[00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:21.000]   It's more than a negotiation point.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.560]   I think it's a message.
[00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:25.280]   I think this is a message to US companies.
[00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:29.800]   But to your point, saying, stop fighting us so hard,
[00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:32.640]   because we could squeeze a lot harder.
[00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:34.880]   And a company like Apple--
[00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:37.800]   I mean, look at Steve's rational economic decision.
[00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:40.120]   Well, I'm not going to do a crypto product,
[00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:42.320]   because I don't want to be put in that position.
[00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:44.920]   A company like Apple that's already in that position
[00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:47.520]   is probably going to be more likely to cooperate
[00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:50.600]   in the hopes that something more draconian
[00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:51.600]   doesn't become law.
[00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:54.400]   So my suspicion is that this isn't something
[00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:58.920]   that Feinstein, Burr, or anybody else thinks would become law.
[00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:01.080]   But as you say, it's a stick.
[00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:04.240]   And they're suggesting that maybe you guys
[00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:05.560]   want to be a little bit more helpful.
[00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:09.520]   The problem is there's no halfway with encryption.
[00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:14.560]   It either works and is impenetrable or it doesn't work.
[00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:17.120]   And it's impenetrable not only to law enforcement,
[00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:19.320]   but as you say, to criminals.
[00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:20.200]   I think really--
[00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:24.120]   I think there's some politics here, too.
[00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:26.320]   The right wing of the American--
[00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:28.440]   the Tea Party and the extreme right wing
[00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:30.000]   would like to put this type of thing up
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:31.560]   and then watch the left wing--
[00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:32.920]   Go crazy.
[00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:35.440]   You've been watching our election.
[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:41.600]   You're kind of getting some insight into how it works here,
[00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:42.560]   are you?
[00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:44.640]   Well, it's the same sort of thing happens every minute.
[00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:46.240]   I'm sure it is.
[00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:48.600]   I think there's many nuances.
[00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:52.040]   I think it's put out a bill like this, start the discussion,
[00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:53.280]   put out, make it extreme.
[00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:55.520]   If you wind it back, it's also political.
[00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:57.800]   The people who are releasing this are extreme right wing.
[00:24:57.800 --> 00:24:59.640]   Well now we should point out that Dianne Feinstein
[00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:02.120]   is a Democratic senator from California,
[00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:03.880]   who has not been--
[00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:07.200]   I mean, she's moved farther to the right each year of her term,
[00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:10.400]   but nevertheless is ostensibly a Democrat.
[00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:12.440]   I mean, I read this, and it's a horror story,
[00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:14.600]   especially for American cloud companies.
[00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:18.440]   So people in tech who are followers of AWS or Rackspace
[00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:20.880]   or Google Compute or even Facebook,
[00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:23.160]   this is very bad news because if this does get up,
[00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:25.560]   you're going to see a reaction from the European governments
[00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:27.760]   where they're going to legislate much harder
[00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:30.400]   than they're already doing to say people in Europe
[00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:32.280]   cannot do business with those companies,
[00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:34.200]   you'll have to take your data out.
[00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:37.320]   It's already a seesaw type of a thing there now.
[00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:38.920]   And if they push much harder,
[00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:41.640]   I think they're going to find a serious reaction
[00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:44.480]   and billions of dollars of revenue will be lost.
[00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:46.680]   And I'm not sure that they're caring about that.
[00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:47.520]   Yeah.
[00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:50.160]   I think really what has to happen at this point is that we,
[00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:54.920]   as users, now need to educate ourselves about crypto.
[00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:58.040]   I know you're right, Georgia, that a normal person--
[00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:00.440]   see, what Apple's doing and the thing
[00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:01.680]   that law enforcement doesn't like
[00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:04.800]   is they're trying to make it easy and universal.
[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:06.240]   That's, I think, in the long run,
[00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:09.600]   probably not going to happen because of stuff like this.
[00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:13.640]   But it's very clear that if you know what you're doing,
[00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:16.880]   you can achieve privacy and strong encryption.
[00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:18.800]   And I think it would behoove all of us at this point,
[00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:20.800]   not only to educate ourselves about it,
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:24.680]   about PGP, a new privacy guard, WhatsApp, signal,
[00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:27.680]   open whisper systems, strong encryption
[00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:29.560]   that is not penetrable to law enforcement
[00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:32.080]   and cannot be made penetrable law enforcement.
[00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:35.160]   And then tell friends and family,
[00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:38.680]   you can use WhatsApp now and be relatively secure.
[00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:40.680]   Although metadata incidentally, metadata
[00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:42.920]   does leak from WhatsApp.
[00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:44.480]   You can be secure with WhatsApp.
[00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:45.800]   But as far as I can tell, Steve, I'm
[00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:47.480]   sure is going to weigh in on this a little bit more.
[00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:48.680]   He's reading the white paper.
[00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:51.320]   But WhatsApp uses your phone number
[00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:53.040]   to identify you, which makes sense.
[00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:54.480]   I mean, that's how your friends know you
[00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:57.000]   and can add you to their WhatsApp.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.360]   But it's then attached to your identity on WhatsApp.
[00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:00.760]   And so there's some metadata leaking.
[00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:03.400]   Also, who you're talking to is leaked.
[00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:05.240]   So while the content is invisible,
[00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:07.880]   WhatsApp is not a perfect solution either.
[00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:09.720]   You would think after the Panama,
[00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:11.600]   you think after the Panama paper,
[00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:13.400]   that the government would be a little bit more like
[00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:14.440]   a set of sections.
[00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:15.440]   Don't--
[00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:16.440]   Don't mean to say--
[00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:17.280]   Don't mean to say--
[00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:18.080]   Don't mean to say a stand that.
[00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:21.000]   They want strong encryption and privacy for themselves.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:21.640]   Right.
[00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:23.880]   They're not saying that they don't get it.
[00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:24.880]   They're saying we don't get it.
[00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:26.000]   No, that's very important.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.360]   And I think that was part of the problem people had
[00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:31.000]   with the David Cameron's stance on encryption.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.400]   Greg, correct me if I'm wrong, is that, oh no,
[00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:36.000]   we in the government will have strong encryption.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.720]   It's just you that can't.
[00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:40.240]   This state level, there's a big difference
[00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:42.400]   between state level actors and personal actors.
[00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:42.920]   Right.
[00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:45.080]   That is when you're a state level infrastructure
[00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:49.680]   and you're like GCHQ or the NSA in the US or the DSD
[00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:53.560]   in Australia, the ability to collect data
[00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:55.040]   at such vast quantities.
[00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:58.160]   Because you've got so much money and the legal empowerment
[00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:02.320]   to tap mainstream activities, that is the key.
[00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:05.880]   Now, when you're acting at that scale, having a back door
[00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:08.560]   or the ability to unlock everything
[00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:11.320]   gives you unlimited capability to extract data.
[00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:14.160]   And I've heard various stories.
[00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:15.800]   Like I work in enterprise security.
[00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:18.640]   My day job is about enterprise networking.
[00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:21.480]   And I can heard various stories about governments just
[00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:23.920]   capturing all the packets and then sinking them into bunkers
[00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:27.600]   so that they can play them back decades after they've been caught.
[00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:29.320]   And that's where it is.
[00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:31.840]   And these types of bills are all intended
[00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:35.720]   to keep the government in control over that data
[00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:38.960]   and over unlocking it so that they can extract it later on.
[00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:41.520]   I think there's-- the real weakness here, of course,
[00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:43.400]   is-- and I don't want to turn this into a political show,
[00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:46.840]   but if the government start to act irregularly,
[00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:49.320]   like we've seen many abuses from the smaller police
[00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:53.080]   departments in the US, the English legal systems
[00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:55.400]   are a little bit more unified than it is in the US
[00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:57.120]   and has different sorts of controls.
[00:28:57.120 --> 00:29:00.000]   But I think the big point is that this bill
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.600]   says any court member.
[00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:03.200]   So you could imagine a county court
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:05.520]   in some small town of rural America.
[00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:10.360]   Something like maybe Maricopa County, Arizona.
[00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:12.440]   That's a scary guy.
[00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:14.960]   And imagine if they said we want two terabytes of data
[00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:18.640]   from Amazon on everything that's been done with IBM.
[00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:24.280]   Well, we live in an era of big data.
[00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:27.840]   We live in an era where computing power is so extreme
[00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:30.400]   that they can process huge amounts of data very quickly
[00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:33.600]   and derive all sorts of interesting things
[00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:34.920]   from the government.
[00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:36.720]   It has lots of tools.
[00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:39.080]   Just leave us our encryption, please.
[00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:39.800]   Let's please.
[00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:41.240]   That's all.
[00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:43.040]   You must use what's appoam.
[00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:46.600]   I mean, I'm sure that that's a tool for you, right?
[00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:47.240]   I do.
[00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:50.520]   I insist how I communicate with my parents.
[00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:53.360]   Do you find it interesting that in one fell swoop,
[00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:56.280]   this Facebook owned company has given strong encryption
[00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:59.840]   to a billion people, not just for text messaging,
[00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:03.400]   but for phone calls and video and audio?
[00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:04.600]   Doesn't surprise me.
[00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:06.320]   I think that's the right way to do it.
[00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:10.560]   I think the founder of WhatsApp, Jankoo,
[00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:14.280]   is from a former Soviet republic.
[00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:19.240]   So you understand what draconian governments can do
[00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:21.480]   with information and data.
[00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:27.080]   And I think it's a very brave step for him to take.
[00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:30.160]   And I'm actually pretty excited that he did.
[00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:35.320]   I think the one aspect of all these encryption tools,
[00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:37.560]   which are available right now, I think
[00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:40.360]   if you currently use any kind of encryption
[00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:44.840]   or any kind of technology like that,
[00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:47.400]   it's actually you get flagged for using it.
[00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:51.040]   And so you're actually creating a bigger issue for yourself
[00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:53.680]   if you're using encryption technologies.
[00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:57.800]   So this brute force approach to encryption and privacy
[00:30:57.800 --> 00:31:02.360]   and data collection is being a running,
[00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:05.840]   rough shot on the rights of average people.
[00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:07.240]   I think that's a bigger challenge.
[00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:12.160]   And I think in this debate about security and terrorism
[00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:16.720]   and everything, the thing we are constantly forgetting
[00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:19.000]   is the basic rights of people.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.480]   Yeah.
[00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:21.360]   We're going to take a break.
[00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:26.960]   Om Malik is here, creator of ging@om.com.
[00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:29.440]   And you're still doing the weekend reading links, right?
[00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:32.440]   That's a great service to all of us.
[00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:33.640]   I love that.
[00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:37.520]   It's on tinyletter.com/omalic.
[00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:44.480]   Tinyletter.com/omalic to subscribe.
[00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:46.160]   And by the way, congratulations.
[00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:50.520]   He's running for the New Yorker now, which is freaking awesome.
[00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:51.040]   Thank you.
[00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:55.480]   That's got to be a big bucket list item, right?
[00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:55.840]   Yep.
[00:31:55.840 --> 00:32:02.640]   One article in New Yorker I could rest.
[00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:06.920]   You actually wrote a really good one on photography.
[00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:10.840]   Photograph everything, see nothing.
[00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:13.480]   And I'd love to talk a little bit about that when we come back.
[00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:14.760]   Also here, Georgia Dow.
[00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:18.920]   And we're going to ask you, Georgia, to defend night shift.
[00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:20.840]   Because I think this whole blue light thing
[00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:22.640]   is a bunch of bogusity.
[00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:23.280]   I know you don't.
[00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:24.680]   This will be interesting that way.
[00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:25.880]   Yeah, I know you don't.
[00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:29.600]   Greg Ferros, by the way, imore.com for Georgia Dow.
[00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:32.240]   But she also does-- she does a lot of stuff on sleep.
[00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:35.640]   And you've got videos-- what's the video site?
[00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:35.920]   Sure.
[00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:39.200]   It's anxiety-videos.com.
[00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:41.040]   And on there, we have a video for people
[00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:42.520]   that may deal with insomnia.
[00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:43.680]   Plus, we have two new ones.
[00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:45.920]   We have one that's dealing with parenting
[00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:48.640]   and one that deals with restructuring negative thought
[00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:49.120]   patterns.
[00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:49.840]   Oh, neat.
[00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:51.720]   Georgia, of course, a licensed family therapist
[00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:54.600]   in her real day job.
[00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:58.080]   And lots of good stuff on this.
[00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:00.000]   Parenting two.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.320]   How old are your-- how old is your kid?
[00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:02.760]   Is it five?
[00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:04.600]   I have a seven-year-old and a 10-year-old.
[00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:05.920]   Seven and 10.
[00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:07.040]   Two boys.
[00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:09.600]   Oh, Lord.
[00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:11.040]   There's this-- I used to have a pillow
[00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:15.280]   that's at this special place in heaven for the mother of boys.
[00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:16.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:17.840]   Yes.
[00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:19.720]   That's true for every parent.
[00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:20.760]   It's really true.
[00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:21.280]   It's really true.
[00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:22.440]   I'm like a boy myself, though.
[00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:24.680]   I like video games and fighting and martial arts.
[00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:26.600]   Yeah, by the way, you could kick their asses
[00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:29.200]   and be able to continue to do so.
[00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:34.520]   Georgia is a Canadian champion in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.
[00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:35.360]   What?
[00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:36.160]   I'm sorry.
[00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:37.560]   You said you know what?
[00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:38.520]   I didn't mean to interrupt you.
[00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:39.480]   I'm so sorry, Georgia.
[00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:40.480]   No, no, no.
[00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:41.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:43.000]   Renee's taught you some moves.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:43.520]   Yeah.
[00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:44.040]   I saw that.
[00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:45.040]   I know how to do a choke hold.
[00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:46.600]   You'll be able to defend it, yeah.
[00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:49.080]   He tapped out and I forgot to stop.
[00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:50.120]   Almost killed the four-boy.
[00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:51.040]   It was very funny.
[00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:52.360]   It was really funny.
[00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:53.720]   And we have a noobie win our mitts,
[00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:56.520]   but he's already become a great contributor.
[00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:57.960]   It's really nice to have you, Greg.
[00:33:57.960 --> 00:33:59.120]   And I'm sure we'll see a lot more of you.
[00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:02.160]   Greg Farrow is the host of packet pushers, which
[00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:03.520]   you'll find at packet pushers.net.
[00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:05.680]   And I didn't realize this security
[00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:09.480]   is part of your day job.
[00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:12.960]   Well, mostly I do data networking for large,
[00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:15.920]   put to 100 and Fortune 100 companies.
[00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:19.280]   But these days, I'm a full-time podcaster and a writer
[00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:21.360]   on technology, Enterprise IT.
[00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:22.280]   Yeah.
[00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:24.400]   And did you get your Twitter handle
[00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:26.760]   and before Ethereum became Wireshark
[00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:28.920]   or is it some other kind of ethereal?
[00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:30.040]   Ah, you do remember.
[00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:30.800]   There you go.
[00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:32.240]   Yes.
[00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:36.200]   I did partly use the word ethereal for its spiritual aspects.
[00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:39.480]   Originally, I started out blogging on a different theme
[00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:41.720]   before I just shifted over to technology full-time.
[00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:44.840]   And now I'm just a full-time geek.
[00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:45.480]   What's it say?
[00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:46.720]   Show us a shirt.
[00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:47.320]   We can't see it.
[00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:48.320]   Oh, the shirt says--
[00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:48.800]   Geek.
[00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:49.760]   Oh, well.
[00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:50.480]   You must be one.
[00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:53.080]   You've got the shirt.
[00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:54.040]   Anyway, great to have you.
[00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:55.320]   Thank you for joining us.
[00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:56.320]   Thank you so much.
[00:34:56.320 --> 00:35:00.160]   Our show today brought to you by Carbonite Online Backup.
[00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:04.400]   A big part of your security plan is having a good backup.
[00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:05.760]   You know, we talk a lot.
[00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:07.920]   Especially on the radio show about ransomware.
[00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:10.200]   It is gone.
[00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:13.680]   I mean, two more hospitals were hit by ransomware last week.
[00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:17.640]   It seems to me nobody who has an IT department should ever
[00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:18.680]   be hit by ransomware.
[00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:19.680]   And yet they are.
[00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:21.360]   And you know what the solution is?
[00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:23.160]   A good backup with versioning.
[00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:24.360]   If you want to know more about it,
[00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:28.480]   Carbonite has a great white paper on how you can use--
[00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:31.760]   go to the carbonite.com and the resources section
[00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:33.520]   and look under white papers.
[00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:37.840]   Very good article about recovering from ransomware
[00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:40.800]   and preparing from ransomware.
[00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:42.880]   Ransomware, Preparedness and Recovery Guide.
[00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:45.920]   And the key is a good backup with versioning.
[00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:47.240]   And that's what Carbonite is.
[00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:50.280]   Carbonite is a solution for home, for office.
[00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:52.760]   It gives it online backup.
[00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:56.960]   So your data is stored in the Carbonite Cloud where it is safe.
[00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:58.720]   This is a great time to sign up if you've
[00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:00.840]   been hearing me talk about it.
[00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:03.560]   And I know you have because I talk about it a lot.
[00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:05.640]   Right now, if you use the offer code TWIT,
[00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:08.120]   you'll get two bonus months with your--
[00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:09.840]   first of all, try it for free.
[00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:12.040]   You get two free bonus months if you decide to buy.
[00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:13.960]   And right now, up to 30% off.
[00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:15.840]   So this is a really good time.
[00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:18.920]   The nice thing about Carbonite is you pay by the year.
[00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:22.120]   It says, little as $5, actually $4.99 a month
[00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:25.200]   for everything on an individual computer.
[00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:28.440]   Windows or Mac, home or office.
[00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:31.680]   And by the way, that's for an unlimited amount of data.
[00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:34.760]   It's the most affordable backup out there.
[00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:36.120]   So you've got to check it out.
[00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:38.280]   More than a million and a half customers now in business
[00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:39.000]   and at home.
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   I use it at home.
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:42.400]   And they have restored--
[00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:46.360]   and I love this stat-- 50 billion files.
[00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:49.720]   That's 50 billion files that would have been lost
[00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:51.240]   without Carbonite.
[00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:54.200]   Carbonite.com, no credit card required for the free trial.
[00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:55.520]   But do use our offer code TWIT.
[00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:58.040]   That way you'll get two free bonus months when you buy.
[00:36:58.040 --> 00:36:59.720]   And take advantage of this 30% off.
[00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:02.080]   This is not going to last.
[00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:03.240]   Carbonite.com.
[00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:05.400]   And if you go to, again, resources, white papers,
[00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:08.480]   you can read about the ransomware preparedness
[00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:09.320]   and recovery guide.
[00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:11.640]   And I know a lot of you in small business.
[00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:13.520]   Have any of your clients been hit by that, Greg,
[00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:15.800]   brand somewhere?
[00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:18.680]   Not the ones that I know of or--
[00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:20.320]   let's say none of that I can talk about.
[00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:21.320]   Yeah.
[00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:21.640]   Yeah.
[00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:23.440]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:24.360]   That's a interesting answer.
[00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:26.200]   That's an interesting answer.
[00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:28.840]   I have friends who've been hit and have been publicly released
[00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:31.400]   information about it in the medical community.
[00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:34.760]   And the damage to those medical institutions was just--
[00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:35.680]   Is that shocking?
[00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:37.560]   And what really shocks me-- and I'm sure
[00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:41.080]   as an IT networking professional, it must shock you too--
[00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:44.280]   is that they did not have some form of backup.
[00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:47.120]   They had to pay the ransom.
[00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:48.120]   Crazy.
[00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:48.720]   But I don't surprise me at all.
[00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:52.360]   Medical institutions generally have a very confusing array
[00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:58.800]   of IT, and often it's not possible to have the systems fully
[00:37:58.800 --> 00:37:59.320]   under control.
[00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:01.440]   But doctors are going one way.
[00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:03.120]   Patients are going another way.
[00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:04.920]   The hospital administration's going another way.
[00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:06.720]   And often the backups aren't there.
[00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:10.920]   And those sort of cloud tools are a possibility, by the way.
[00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:13.440]   I mean, those carbonite, that type of backup,
[00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:16.120]   can certainly work, especially for small doctor surgeries.
[00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:17.600]   It's a simple solution.
[00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:18.440]   Yeah.
[00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:20.920]   Yeah.
[00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:22.960]   You know, you don't want to pay these ransoms,
[00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:26.080]   because that just encourages them.
[00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:29.280]   It's kind of not the ideal solution.
[00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:32.360]   And by the way, the $17,000 that that hospital in Southern
[00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:34.760]   California paid is nothing compared
[00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:38.840]   to the government fines they're going to get for HIPAA violations.
[00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:44.400]   The loss of that data violates the federal HIPAA laws.
[00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:47.160]   Yeah, I've always maintained that the best security strategy
[00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:49.120]   you can have is a media strategy.
[00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:50.720]   There's no way you'll be secure.
[00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:53.080]   The only way, the best thing you can hope for
[00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:56.280]   is a strong recovery from a security event.
[00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:58.960]   And so plan a media strategy and then have a budget
[00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:02.760]   reparose already once you get slammed without security event.
[00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:06.880]   I'm really curious what you all think about Revolve.
[00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:12.240]   This is, it seems to me, a black mark against Google.
[00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:17.240]   If Revolve made a home automation hub, R-E-V-O-L-V,
[00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:22.880]   no E on the end, looked like a little jar of hummus.
[00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:26.640]   And in fact, that's what one poster on Media Marlow Gilbert
[00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:27.840]   called it.
[00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:30.040]   He wrote an article saying, "The time that Tony Fadel
[00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:32.040]   sold me a container of hummus--" actually,
[00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:33.800]   Tony Fadel did not sell it to him.
[00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:36.400]   Revolve was a business.
[00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:37.400]   They sold a few of these.
[00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:38.920]   They were not inexpensive.
[00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:40.840]   There were several hundred bucks.
[00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:42.200]   Nest bought them.
[00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:44.960]   Of course, Nest is an alphabet company.
[00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:47.760]   And Nest has announced that, come May 15,
[00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:51.440]   they're just going to turn it off.
[00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:55.080]   Even though you own the hardware, it will be non-functioning.
[00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:57.920]   They're essentially going to brick the hardware on May 15
[00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:00.160]   by turning off the servers.
[00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:02.320]   The thing that I find very offensive
[00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:09.600]   is this hardware was billed, it said, guaranteed for life.
[00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:11.680]   Now, of course, you see that all the time.
[00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:16.440]   And one of the weasel words is, whose life?
[00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:20.280]   And maybe the life was the working life of this product.
[00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:22.480]   So legally, they probably get away with this.
[00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:24.800]   But it just seems to me such a mistake for Google,
[00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:28.360]   which already has a bad rap for discontinuing stuff,
[00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:32.320]   like Google Reader, Google Wave.
[00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:36.280]   The people use-- here's a case where people
[00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:37.520]   have been using this Revolve Hub.
[00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:38.720]   They spent 300 bucks for it.
[00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:41.720]   It may have spent many more hundreds of dollars, even thousands
[00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:44.720]   of dollars for devices that connect to it.
[00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:48.280]   And now it's going to be bricked.
[00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:51.960]   Oh, is this bad for Google?
[00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:55.680]   I would love to know how many people actually own this thing.
[00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:58.920]   I think this is way over a bone story than anything else.
[00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:04.280]   Even if it's five, though, even if it's a handful,
[00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:07.040]   the message Google's sending is not good.
[00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:08.160]   And you know what?
[00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:10.920]   If it is five, how much could it cost for Google
[00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:15.720]   to run a server in the closet that keeps this service alive?
[00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:18.640]   I don't know the facts here on this product,
[00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:23.400]   but I can tell you that there isn't that many people who
[00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:25.720]   were actually probably using this product.
[00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:27.600]   That's why they took the decision.
[00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:31.360]   Secondly, I think when a startup sells out for money
[00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:36.480]   to other people, they are essentially giving up control.
[00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:39.760]   And that's one thing everybody needs to know and remember
[00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:44.120]   when they buy a product from a startup.
[00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:46.640]   So that sounds like you're saying whatever you do,
[00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:48.120]   don't buy a product from a startup
[00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:49.680]   if you want it to continue to work.
[00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:56.440]   You should buy things being aware that to startup may sell out,
[00:41:56.440 --> 00:41:58.440]   the company may go out of business.
[00:41:58.440 --> 00:42:00.440]   You got to support the product because you actually
[00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:04.120]   love the product, not because for life.
[00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:07.480]   Life in technology products doesn't exist.
[00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:10.160]   I mean, that just is not real.
[00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:14.880]   I kind of find that Google may be at fault here,
[00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:18.000]   but also we don't have all the facts on this.
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:20.360]   But does it matter that when you pay 300 bucks,
[00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:24.920]   they claim you have a lifetime subscription?
[00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:26.200]   I mean, that's what they say.
[00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:28.920]   This is-- here's the good news about Revolve.
[00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:30.440]   There's no monthly subscriptions.
[00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:34.920]   You get a lifetime subscription with your $300 purchase.
[00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:37.320]   And I think that the problem is that it was bought out
[00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:38.000]   by a big company.
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:41.040]   I would understand if you invest in a small company
[00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:45.920]   and they go out of business, they have a bad marketing scheme.
[00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:48.240]   And so you support a small business
[00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:49.520]   and you're like, you know what?
[00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:51.000]   There's a certain amount of risk there.
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:52.960]   But they were bought out by Google.
[00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:54.360]   Google's doing really well.
[00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:56.080]   There's no reason that they couldn't
[00:42:56.080 --> 00:42:58.040]   decide to continue supporting their product
[00:42:58.040 --> 00:43:02.120]   because Google, as its name, carries value.
[00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:05.640]   And a lot of bad press is bad for all of the stocks for Google.
[00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:06.840]   That's what I think.
[00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:09.280]   I mean, I'm going to think twice about adopting a Google
[00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:12.280]   service because they seem to have a habit of pulling
[00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:13.320]   the plug on things.
[00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:16.200]   Doesn't that hurt them?
[00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:20.600]   So by the way, because of the clamor,
[00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:23.880]   here's the EFF article, Nest reminds customers' ownership
[00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:28.880]   of what it used to be because of this hubbub.
[00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:32.640]   Revolve is asking people to contact them on Twitter
[00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:33.960]   so we can work out something.
[00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:38.640]   And apparently they're offering a refund of the $300 price,
[00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:41.960]   which is great, except unless you paid for a lot of other stuff
[00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:46.600]   to work with it, they're asking that you email help
[00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:50.800]   at revolve.com so we can help you out during this transition
[00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:53.080]   and provide you with a refund.
[00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:54.760]   Is that enough?
[00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:56.680]   I feel like that's not enough.
[00:43:56.680 --> 00:44:00.480]   But I guess here's my moral.
[00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:02.840]   You tell me where I'm wrong, Om.
[00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:06.880]   The moral of this lesson is, A, buy open source stuff
[00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:09.600]   that supports open standards so that you're not
[00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:14.080]   reliant on one company to continue to run the server.
[00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:17.080]   Very kind of important.
[00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:18.680]   And two, don't trust Google because they
[00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:20.320]   pull the plug on stuff right and left.
[00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:22.840]   And thank god they haven't pulled the plug on Gmail
[00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:25.240]   or Google Voice yet, but it could happen any day now.
[00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:28.480]   OK, Om, I'm sorry.
[00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:29.240]   Are you done?
[00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:32.320]   I'm done.
[00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:34.920]   I mean, I can't argue with you on that one.
[00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:38.720]   I think you're just angry about the stuff, you know?
[00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:41.840]   But you're right, they pull the plug on a lot of things.
[00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:47.840]   But I also feel that in this case, we don't have all the facts.
[00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:52.720]   I think getting outraged on revolve is one thing.
[00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:55.640]   Yes, Google Reader, that was bad.
[00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:59.600]   And I think the Nick Software is another one where you know
[00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:00.960]   they're going to pull the plug on the app.
[00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:01.880]   Yeah, they're giving it away.
[00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:03.080]   That's nice.
[00:45:03.080 --> 00:45:05.880]   But I paid 300 bucks for it.
[00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:07.880]   So A, I don't get the freebie.
[00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:09.160]   And B, you're right.
[00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:10.920]   They're obviously not going to develop it anymore.
[00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:11.320]   That's it.
[00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:13.120]   It's the end of life for that.
[00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:14.800]   And that's another company they bought.
[00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:18.880]   Now, they have Snapstream, which is their mobile version
[00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:19.720]   of the Nick Software.
[00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:21.840]   And I'm sure Google will keep that up until they get bored
[00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:22.280]   with it.
[00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:26.680]   Somebody told me that the problem is structural.
[00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:29.080]   I'm trying to remember who I was talking to about this.
[00:45:29.080 --> 00:45:32.600]   Maybe it was Brad Sam's from Petri.
[00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:36.640]   He said, here's what I deduced by talking to Google engineers
[00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:37.720]   is the way Google works.
[00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:38.880]   Tell me if I'm wrong them.
[00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:41.800]   The way Google works is engineers pick the things
[00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:43.000]   they want to work on.
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:45.600]   It's almost like you've got to create a sexy project
[00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:47.520]   so you can get the best engineers at Google.
[00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:50.440]   And what happens is they work on this stuff
[00:45:50.440 --> 00:45:52.200]   because it's exciting and new.
[00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:54.320]   It gets released, and then they move on.
[00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:56.360]   And it's impossible to get an engineer at Google
[00:45:56.360 --> 00:46:00.840]   to stick around and maintain things because that's not sexy.
[00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:04.000]   Well, that's been the problem with them for a while now.
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.760]   And I think that's why you're beginning
[00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:10.600]   to see the company become a little bit more careful
[00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:14.600]   and stringent about how they want to do things.
[00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:16.000]   There is more accountability.
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:21.440]   I think a lot of it is due to the new CFO.
[00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:24.760]   And she is actually making sure that there
[00:46:24.760 --> 00:46:27.200]   is more structure in this company.
[00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:30.040]   Like, yes, I've heard multiple times
[00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:33.440]   that people go off and do their own thing a lot.
[00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:37.240]   And as a result of that, there is sometimes chaos.
[00:46:37.240 --> 00:46:39.760]   Creative chaos is more likely.
[00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:42.960]   Maybe start hiring people who like the security
[00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:48.120]   and nine to five nature of just maintaining an existing product,
[00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:51.240]   just keeping it running and data.
[00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:53.000]   But they have a lot of creative people.
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:53.920]   Let's not forget that.
[00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:55.320]   No, and that's good.
[00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:58.520]   And I think that's where all the good ideas come from.
[00:46:58.520 --> 00:47:00.680]   I think the company has had that critical juncture
[00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:04.320]   where it needs to have a transition from--
[00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:10.080]   there's free for all, like, structured to a more organized,
[00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:13.040]   more optimized way of running a business.
[00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:17.840]   But I think it's very hard to find the gap between creativity
[00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:18.680]   and bureaucracy.
[00:47:18.680 --> 00:47:22.280]   And I think, I mean, if there is any one company
[00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:24.720]   which can find it, it might be Google.
[00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:26.680]   Yeah.
[00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:27.920]   I understand it's a challenge.
[00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:32.120]   And Google's goal is to stay nimble, stay innovative.
[00:47:32.120 --> 00:47:35.520]   But then there's a side effect of that, isn't there?
[00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:38.800]   I think we're going to see a lot more of these, Leo, where
[00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:41.360]   IOT is just an emerging technology.
[00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:44.920]   It's roughly around about the 1920s where cars were.
[00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:46.480]   And there's no standards.
[00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:47.960]   None of them interoperate.
[00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:49.840]   There's no agreement between the vendors who
[00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:51.320]   make IOT technology.
[00:47:51.320 --> 00:47:53.000]   Phillips light bulbs.
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:54.480]   You know, for example, the U light bulbs
[00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:57.400]   live in a completely different ecosystem to Apple TVs.
[00:47:57.400 --> 00:47:59.120]   The two should work together.
[00:47:59.120 --> 00:48:01.360]   But instead, they're completely isolated.
[00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:02.080]   They don't.
[00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:05.720]   And aggressively, these people are building their own platforms
[00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:07.640]   to try and lock the competitors out
[00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:08.960]   from those sorts of things.
[00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:12.800]   To me, this is just the first of 100 of these going wrong.
[00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:16.040]   Startups getting early to market.
[00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:19.040]   Their technology will either founder as they run out of cash
[00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:21.840]   and their road drops off and they just run off-clip.
[00:48:21.840 --> 00:48:23.440]   Or they'll get acquired by big companies.
[00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:25.840]   And the big companies either hide them for the people.
[00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:27.520]   Or the technology they're buying
[00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:30.200]   is incompatible with the platform they've got.
[00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:31.560]   You're going to see hundreds of these.
[00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:34.160]   And you're going to see a rejection from the market.
[00:48:34.160 --> 00:48:37.400]   That's-- people are going to say this IOT is rubbish.
[00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:38.600]   And then that's the dip.
[00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:40.000]   The depression in the middle.
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:42.840]   And before we go up into the slope of acceptance
[00:48:42.840 --> 00:48:44.960]   where IOT standards start to emerge.
[00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:46.160]   Standards are key.
[00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:47.480]   And Google's working on standards.
[00:48:47.480 --> 00:48:50.200]   They've got Brillo and Weave and Thread.
[00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:52.480]   And Jasper and Cisco and Phillips and General Oluk.
[00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:53.920]   Everybody else is hearing.
[00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:55.760]   Don't hear it.
[00:48:55.760 --> 00:48:58.000]   There's a dozen standards.
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:48:58.480]   All right.
[00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:01.520]   You want to go and look at what Nokia and Alcatel, Lucent,
[00:49:01.520 --> 00:49:04.480]   and Ericsson are doing to build their 5G networks
[00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:07.320]   into IOT communication platforms.
[00:49:07.320 --> 00:49:10.040]   So that IOT devices aren't connecting back
[00:49:10.040 --> 00:49:12.160]   to services in Amazon's cloud.
[00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:15.520]   But they're using active services provided by the 5G network
[00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:17.840]   that's in the standards that are being developed.
[00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:20.600]   And there's so much going on here
[00:49:20.600 --> 00:49:22.040]   that we have to fix in IOT.
[00:49:22.040 --> 00:49:25.000]   This is just the first casualty in a train wreck
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   of Rob Dignaggy and proportions.
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:27.920]   Wow.
[00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:31.720]   I think the thing to remember is that we've
[00:49:31.720 --> 00:49:34.680]   gotten used to doing beta in software.
[00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:37.800]   And we are applying that same logic to hardware now.
[00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:43.560]   And I think the average humans don't have an unlimited wallet
[00:49:43.560 --> 00:49:45.360]   to keep buying these things.
[00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:51.360]   So there is always a risk of alienating the mass market
[00:49:51.360 --> 00:49:56.840]   by just coming to market too soon.
[00:49:56.840 --> 00:49:57.120]   Yeah.
[00:49:57.120 --> 00:49:59.040]   And we do gain-- OK.
[00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:00.280]   You calm me down.
[00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:01.080]   You talk me down.
[00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:04.640]   I mean, we gain something by this kind of quick iteration.
[00:50:04.640 --> 00:50:08.080]   We certainly have in software.
[00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:10.040]   But it means to me that people who
[00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:12.280]   are intrigued by the internet of things
[00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:14.880]   and the promise of these IOT devices,
[00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:17.240]   would they be better off waiting?
[00:50:17.240 --> 00:50:21.800]   And if they wait, then who funds the growth?
[00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:24.880]   Certainly, many of us have learned not to put money
[00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:26.080]   into Kickstarter projects.
[00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:27.400]   I apparently haven't learned that.
[00:50:27.400 --> 00:50:28.400]   But--
[00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:30.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:34.240]   I think for now, IOT is a completely nascent.
[00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:36.600]   It should be ignored by the mass market.
[00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:40.280]   There's no practical way that a normal person can take IOT
[00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:42.800]   and start to automate their house.
[00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:44.400]   I certainly aren't buying any of it,
[00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:48.360]   because I've not been able to make any of it integrate.
[00:50:48.360 --> 00:50:51.560]   Without spending dozens of hours writing code and shims
[00:50:51.560 --> 00:50:54.680]   between different platforms, even fiddling with IFTT
[00:50:54.680 --> 00:50:58.360]   so that this thermostat talks to this controller that does this.
[00:50:58.360 --> 00:51:00.920]   My life's too short for that sort of stupidity.
[00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:03.880]   I want to get on with something else.
[00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:06.800]   It's like internet of tinkering more than anything else,
[00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:07.880]   not internet of things.
[00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:10.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:15.840]   Now I have two titles, potential titles, two candidate titles
[00:51:15.840 --> 00:51:16.360]   for the show.
[00:51:16.360 --> 00:51:18.840]   I was going to use a brain, a train wreck of broadening
[00:51:18.840 --> 00:51:20.400]   naggy and proportions.
[00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:22.480]   By the way, the first to bring Jonathan Swift
[00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:23.480]   into the conversation.
[00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:25.160]   Thank you, Greg.
[00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:26.080]   And then what did you say?
[00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:28.440]   A tinkle internet of tinkering.
[00:51:28.440 --> 00:51:28.880]   Tinkering.
[00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:30.320]   Tinkering.
[00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:31.760]   I like that too.
[00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:34.840]   Tinkering thinking.
[00:51:34.840 --> 00:51:37.720]   And Dr. Morbius in the chat room does have a good point.
[00:51:37.720 --> 00:51:41.120]   Light bulbs don't really need to be smart.
[00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:42.480]   They just need to show some light.
[00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:45.280]   Although I've seen speakers now and light bulbs that
[00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:48.640]   can be controlled by the sunset using IFTT than that.
[00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:50.960]   It's kind of cool to be able to say Game of Thrones
[00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:53.400]   and my lights turn into red.
[00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:53.680]   You don't do that.
[00:51:53.680 --> 00:51:54.720]   That's kind of cool.
[00:51:54.720 --> 00:51:55.920]   I didn't mind you that.
[00:51:55.920 --> 00:51:56.840]   Do you do that?
[00:51:56.840 --> 00:52:00.480]   You say I am the mother of dragons and everything gets red.
[00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:01.960]   And then everything gets red.
[00:52:01.960 --> 00:52:04.120]   I do have a certain lighting scope depending
[00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:04.960]   on what I'm watching.
[00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:06.160]   It's just for the moon.
[00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:07.440]   Look, it happened.
[00:52:07.440 --> 00:52:09.120]   I have that control too.
[00:52:09.120 --> 00:52:11.120]   Although in order to do that, I have
[00:52:11.120 --> 00:52:13.560]   built a million dollar studio and higher producers
[00:52:13.560 --> 00:52:14.960]   and engineers and lighting.
[00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:16.880]   Yeah, but you have people that can turn the switches.
[00:52:16.880 --> 00:52:17.880]   I have people.
[00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:18.400]   Yes.
[00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:21.040]   But do you say I am the mother of dragons and then
[00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:21.560]   does it work?
[00:52:21.560 --> 00:52:22.040]   That's what I want to--
[00:52:22.040 --> 00:52:22.520]   Let me try it.
[00:52:22.520 --> 00:52:24.280]   Let me see here.
[00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:27.320]   I am the mother of dragons.
[00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:28.320]   Whoa.
[00:52:28.320 --> 00:52:29.120]   Oh.
[00:52:29.120 --> 00:52:30.120]   That's cool.
[00:52:30.120 --> 00:52:34.240]   And if I'm suddenly naked because my clothes burn off then,
[00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:35.720]   then you wouldn't know.
[00:52:35.720 --> 00:52:36.280]   And you wouldn't know.
[00:52:36.280 --> 00:52:38.200]   Do they have Game of Thrones in the UK?
[00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:39.760]   They must, Greg.
[00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:41.520]   I have no idea what you're talking about.
[00:52:41.520 --> 00:52:45.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:46.640]   You don't watch any TV, Ome.
[00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:47.080]   That's why.
[00:52:47.080 --> 00:52:48.640]   You need to watch more TV.
[00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:52.680]   How do you have so much time, Leo?
[00:52:52.680 --> 00:52:55.240]   Because I get home from doing all these shows,
[00:52:55.240 --> 00:52:57.360]   and I'm in a coma, basically.
[00:52:57.360 --> 00:52:59.520]   And Lisa just props me up in the couch.
[00:52:59.520 --> 00:53:01.520]   Turns on the TV and gives me a feeding tube,
[00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:03.520]   and then I'm there for the next 12 hours.
[00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:04.520]   All right.
[00:53:04.520 --> 00:53:05.760]   That's how you regen.
[00:53:05.760 --> 00:53:07.360]   I regen that way.
[00:53:07.360 --> 00:53:07.840]   Yeah.
[00:53:07.840 --> 00:53:10.800]   You know, I just learned that dolphins only sleep
[00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:13.000]   with half of their brain at a time.
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:13.560]   They do.
[00:53:13.560 --> 00:53:15.840]   That's what I need to do.
[00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:16.600]   Half brain sleeping.
[00:53:16.600 --> 00:53:18.000]   Half to be a dolphin, though.
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:19.800]   Oh.
[00:53:19.800 --> 00:53:22.840]   But that's so that if they don't fully go to sleep
[00:53:22.840 --> 00:53:25.680]   in case there's predators, why do I
[00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:27.360]   wake up at four every morning?
[00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:29.760]   There's no predators, or are there?
[00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:36.040]   That's because you're using your tack at night.
[00:53:36.040 --> 00:53:37.760]   No, yeah.
[00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:39.840]   But now, thank God.
[00:53:39.840 --> 00:53:40.480]   Thank God.
[00:53:40.480 --> 00:53:44.360]   Apple's turned it orange, and so it will not wake me up.
[00:53:44.360 --> 00:53:47.240]   Is that true?
[00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:48.080]   OK.
[00:53:48.080 --> 00:53:49.880]   So let's go into this.
[00:53:49.880 --> 00:53:51.040]   This is night shift.
[00:53:51.040 --> 00:53:54.440]   This is a new feature that arrived in iOS 9.3.
[00:53:54.440 --> 00:53:56.560]   It's the first time, in my opinion.
[00:53:56.560 --> 00:54:02.640]   Apple has fallen for the late night television blue blocker
[00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:05.360]   pitch, and they've decided to put blue blockers
[00:54:05.360 --> 00:54:07.720]   in their smartphone.
[00:54:07.720 --> 00:54:10.000]   What's the story?
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:12.400]   So we do have a circadian rhythm,
[00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:15.920]   and that is really important to us feeling tired or not.
[00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:18.640]   And the first, the couple of hours before sleep,
[00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:20.560]   when usually the sun would go down,
[00:54:20.560 --> 00:54:23.000]   and that's the way that our bodies have evolved,
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:25.280]   we would produce a lot of melatonin.
[00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:29.520]   And melatonin is the natural transmitter that says,
[00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:31.760]   we're tired now, we can go to sleep.
[00:54:31.760 --> 00:54:35.800]   Now, just recently, actually, 1998,
[00:54:35.800 --> 00:54:40.360]   we ended up finding out on African tree frogs,
[00:54:40.360 --> 00:54:44.000]   clawed frogs, that there was another type of receptor
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:46.480]   that we had, which were called melopsin.
[00:54:46.480 --> 00:54:49.800]   And those are photo light receptors
[00:54:49.800 --> 00:54:52.480]   that react very strongly to blue wavelength light.
[00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:53.960]   And they're in our eyeballs?
[00:54:53.960 --> 00:54:54.880]   Where are they?
[00:54:54.880 --> 00:54:57.440]   They're only in our eyes.
[00:54:57.440 --> 00:54:58.600]   Like, that's it.
[00:54:58.600 --> 00:54:59.440]   So, yeah.
[00:54:59.440 --> 00:55:00.440]   It's another like rod and cone,
[00:55:00.440 --> 00:55:02.480]   it's like another receptor in there somewhere.
[00:55:02.480 --> 00:55:03.880]   Yes, it's the third receptor.
[00:55:03.880 --> 00:55:08.480]   And so that affects most strongly to blue wavelength light,
[00:55:08.480 --> 00:55:10.120]   so short wavelength light.
[00:55:10.120 --> 00:55:12.960]   And it will actually inhibit for hours,
[00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:14.800]   the production of melatonin.
[00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:17.120]   And we need melatonin to fall asleep.
[00:55:17.120 --> 00:55:19.880]   So they've done, and this is not me,
[00:55:19.880 --> 00:55:21.080]   this is actually science.
[00:55:21.080 --> 00:55:23.120]   They've done conjugence.
[00:55:23.120 --> 00:55:24.600]   Okay, there's another title.
[00:55:24.600 --> 00:55:26.760]   This is not me, this is actually science.
[00:55:26.760 --> 00:55:28.560]   I gotta write these down, 'cause I'll forget 'em.
[00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:29.400]   Okay, go on.
[00:55:29.400 --> 00:55:32.560]   They've been, there's hundreds of thousands of studies
[00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:34.240]   that have gone through sleep
[00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:36.480]   and why we sleep and how to sleep better.
[00:55:36.480 --> 00:55:39.160]   And so, the best way would be just not to use your tach.
[00:55:39.160 --> 00:55:40.000]   It's not just that--
[00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:41.280]   Well, that's okay.
[00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:43.200]   So that's my point.
[00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:46.040]   If the tach is orange, you're still awake.
[00:55:46.040 --> 00:55:48.280]   Look at an Instagram at three in the morning.
[00:55:48.280 --> 00:55:49.120]   You're still awake.
[00:55:49.120 --> 00:55:51.000]   And yes, you're probably getting,
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:53.240]   if it's something that's really intriguing
[00:55:53.240 --> 00:55:57.280]   and exciting, that's probably gonna make you be more awake.
[00:55:57.280 --> 00:55:59.120]   Or if it makes you think or worry,
[00:55:59.120 --> 00:56:00.960]   or if you're reading the discussion draft
[00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:02.800]   from the Feinstein Bill,
[00:56:02.800 --> 00:56:04.520]   you're gonna be more upset than you would
[00:56:04.520 --> 00:56:05.800]   doing something else.
[00:56:05.800 --> 00:56:06.640]   Yeah.
[00:56:06.640 --> 00:56:11.280]   But, at least with it being larger wavelength of light,
[00:56:11.280 --> 00:56:14.760]   you're still producing more melatonin than you would
[00:56:14.760 --> 00:56:17.400]   if you were watching, you're reading your phone
[00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:20.680]   as it would before, with all of this light going straight
[00:56:20.680 --> 00:56:23.800]   to inhibit the production of melatonin.
[00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:25.600]   And so, the studies have shown that it works.
[00:56:25.600 --> 00:56:28.040]   Now, we haven't done studies yet on night shift
[00:56:28.040 --> 00:56:29.520]   in and of itself,
[00:56:29.520 --> 00:56:33.560]   but the studies have shown that using a dimmer light
[00:56:33.560 --> 00:56:37.600]   and using a light on a larger wavelength of spectrum
[00:56:37.600 --> 00:56:40.200]   does help more melatonin,
[00:56:40.200 --> 00:56:42.360]   less melatonin be inhibited
[00:56:42.360 --> 00:56:44.120]   so that you can fall asleep faster.
[00:56:44.120 --> 00:56:46.480]   And those studies have shown that.
[00:56:46.480 --> 00:56:47.320]   Okay.
[00:56:47.320 --> 00:56:49.080]   (laughing)
[00:56:49.080 --> 00:56:51.040]   I don't think we even knew, by the way,
[00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:53.280]   I don't think we even knew till photography came along
[00:56:53.280 --> 00:56:56.320]   that the sun was blue and the indoors was yellow.
[00:56:56.320 --> 00:56:58.080]   I think that our eyes adjust.
[00:56:58.080 --> 00:56:59.480]   It doesn't, you don't go outside and go,
[00:56:59.480 --> 00:57:01.280]   "Wow, it's blue out here."
[00:57:01.280 --> 00:57:04.560]   Because our eyes adjust, our eyes, our brains adjust.
[00:57:04.560 --> 00:57:07.320]   Right, and you get many wavelengths of light in the sun.
[00:57:07.320 --> 00:57:09.880]   It's not just, this is not like, you know,
[00:57:09.880 --> 00:57:13.240]   you're Superman and you know, the yellow sun keeps you power.
[00:57:13.240 --> 00:57:16.080]   I would agree with you that,
[00:57:17.080 --> 00:57:18.880]   I mean, when I'm traveling,
[00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:20.360]   I try to walk in the sun,
[00:57:20.360 --> 00:57:22.760]   even trying to get my circadian rhythms,
[00:57:22.760 --> 00:57:24.760]   my diurnal rhythms,
[00:57:24.760 --> 00:57:27.960]   psych synchronized to the clock of the place I'm at.
[00:57:27.960 --> 00:57:30.360]   And so I would agree with you, bright light, sunlight
[00:57:30.360 --> 00:57:34.200]   definitely tells your body, "Oh, it's daytime."
[00:57:34.200 --> 00:57:36.840]   You know, I'm looking at some of these studies,
[00:57:36.840 --> 00:57:40.600]   like here's one, 14 people.
[00:57:40.600 --> 00:57:43.120]   No, there's some big, huge studies.
[00:57:43.120 --> 00:57:43.960]   Okay.
[00:57:43.960 --> 00:57:47.280]   This one has 14 normal subjects.
[00:57:47.280 --> 00:57:50.640]   We're exposed at night to a 60-minute bright light pulse
[00:57:50.640 --> 00:57:52.600]   between one and two AM,
[00:57:52.600 --> 00:57:56.240]   while wearing orange lens glasses or gray lens glasses
[00:57:56.240 --> 00:58:00.280]   and the amount of salivary melatonin,
[00:58:00.280 --> 00:58:03.680]   and by the way, I mean, it's 25%, it's not even a hue.
[00:58:03.680 --> 00:58:06.640]   And by the way, I take melatonin, it doesn't do crap.
[00:58:06.640 --> 00:58:08.800]   You, melatonin will only work for a few weeks.
[00:58:08.800 --> 00:58:11.720]   You cannot use this as a long-term sleep plan
[00:58:12.920 --> 00:58:14.680]   because your body will adjust.
[00:58:14.680 --> 00:58:16.280]   Right, so you're not gonna produce melatonin
[00:58:16.280 --> 00:58:18.080]   if it's expecting you to get it from a secondary source.
[00:58:18.080 --> 00:58:20.360]   I know you're an actual sleep expert.
[00:58:20.360 --> 00:58:21.200]   And so...
[00:58:21.200 --> 00:58:24.480]   I'm not a sleep expert, I'm an anxiety specialist.
[00:58:24.480 --> 00:58:26.400]   So I'm anxiety is my expert team.
[00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:28.760]   But anxiety's keeping me from sleeping, so...
[00:58:28.760 --> 00:58:29.800]   That's true, that's true.
[00:58:29.800 --> 00:58:32.320]   But probably most of that is because you have cycling thoughts
[00:58:32.320 --> 00:58:34.200]   that go through your head or your problem solving.
[00:58:34.200 --> 00:58:35.040]   Right, right.
[00:58:35.040 --> 00:58:36.040]   At the middle of the night, when we side...
[00:58:36.040 --> 00:58:37.120]   I can't stop thinking.
[00:58:37.120 --> 00:58:39.680]   Right, we're gonna solve the problems of the world at night,
[00:58:39.680 --> 00:58:41.040]   which is the worst time to do it,
[00:58:41.040 --> 00:58:42.920]   and we don't have any distractions
[00:58:42.920 --> 00:58:44.800]   to keep us from thinking these thoughts.
[00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:48.040]   And so they plague us, which is another issue,
[00:58:48.040 --> 00:58:50.680]   but you might as well use night shift.
[00:58:50.680 --> 00:58:52.120]   Put it on the brightest setting.
[00:58:52.120 --> 00:58:53.800]   I would, but it makes everything look like...
[00:58:53.800 --> 00:58:56.280]   It makes everything look like I'm reading parchment paper.
[00:58:56.280 --> 00:58:57.880]   No, but your eyes will adjust.
[00:58:57.880 --> 00:58:59.200]   The interesting, the really cool thing,
[00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:01.360]   a lot of optical illusions will show this.
[00:59:01.360 --> 00:59:04.080]   Yes, that we see white, what we assume should be white,
[00:59:04.080 --> 00:59:06.000]   we will end up, our brains will flip it
[00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:08.000]   and see it as white-tur.
[00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:09.520]   Yeah, you get used to it.
[00:59:09.520 --> 00:59:10.960]   And night shift gives you a slider.
[00:59:10.960 --> 00:59:13.320]   I just feel like this is Apple kind of...
[00:59:13.320 --> 00:59:16.200]   Now, as to me, this looks like Apple's desperate, frankly,
[00:59:16.200 --> 00:59:17.840]   for a new feature.
[00:59:17.840 --> 00:59:21.160]   I've actually been sleeping better, and again,
[00:59:21.160 --> 00:59:23.200]   I'm a study of one. This is a case study.
[00:59:23.200 --> 00:59:25.960]   Best thing to do, be put it away, not use it at all.
[00:59:25.960 --> 00:59:27.320]   I'm not gonna put it away.
[00:59:27.320 --> 00:59:28.320]   Ah.
[00:59:28.320 --> 00:59:29.240]   (laughing)
[00:59:29.240 --> 00:59:33.240]   Well, I've been using an app called Flux on my Mac.
[00:59:33.240 --> 00:59:35.240]   Yeah, if that looks, yeah.
[00:59:35.240 --> 00:59:36.040]   Yeah, if that looks.
[00:59:36.040 --> 00:59:38.120]   And it certainly worked for me.
[00:59:38.120 --> 00:59:40.120]   Now, two things, whether it's actually work...
[00:59:40.120 --> 00:59:41.920]   Case study of two, now, Leo.
[00:59:41.920 --> 00:59:43.400]   (laughing)
[00:59:43.400 --> 00:59:46.320]   Whether it's work because my screen's yellow
[00:59:46.320 --> 00:59:47.720]   and I can't see it anymore,
[00:59:47.720 --> 00:59:49.520]   as it tells me I actually should go to bed,
[00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:51.240]   or whether it's because there's blue lights
[00:59:51.240 --> 00:59:53.120]   not hitting my cones or maybe both.
[00:59:53.120 --> 00:59:54.960]   But I think there's two things.
[00:59:54.960 --> 00:59:56.640]   I do want to point out there's a wonderful,
[00:59:56.640 --> 00:59:59.880]   wonderful podcast called In Our Time,
[00:59:59.880 --> 01:00:02.400]   which is hosted on the BBC with Melvin Bragg
[01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:03.800]   on "Sucadian Rythms",
[01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:06.320]   and they dive into this for 30 minutes,
[01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:08.560]   talking deeply around "Sucadian Rythms"
[01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:11.120]   and blue lights and these extra cones.
[01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:13.560]   And it's a truly fascinating article to listen to.
[01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:15.080]   If you do want to dive deeper into it,
[01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:17.040]   I could highly recommend that to you.
[01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:18.720]   Didn't they do studies of people,
[01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:19.880]   and they put them in caves
[01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:22.920]   where there was no indication of day or night?
[01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:23.760]   Yeah.
[01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:24.920]   And weird things happen,
[01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:29.040]   like they shifted into polyphasic sleep.
[01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:29.880]   Yes.
[01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:30.720]   They do.
[01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:33.280]   They do, and we change our sleep habits as well,
[01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:36.840]   without the cues of having a light source.
[01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:39.240]   We will sleep sometimes for 18 hours,
[01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:41.080]   then we'll be up for four,
[01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:44.040]   and then, and so there is a huge shift without light.
[01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:49.040]   We do need that to kind of keep our bodies clock in sync.
[01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:50.560]   Yeah.
[01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:53.880]   Yeah, I mean, and it may be that polyphasic sleep,
[01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:56.600]   the idea that you sleep in two shifts,
[01:00:56.600 --> 01:01:00.680]   one from when the sun goes down to about four hours in,
[01:01:00.680 --> 01:01:01.960]   say 11 or midnight,
[01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:03.320]   and then you're up for four hours,
[01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:05.520]   and you sleep for another four hours,
[01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:10.000]   is something prior to electric lighting,
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.840]   was the natural mode of sleep.
[01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:16.720]   Yeah, there's still a lot of debate on that, for sure,
[01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:19.880]   on whether or not that's the proper way to sleep.
[01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:21.520]   There's a lot of people that do sleep that way,
[01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:23.640]   and it works out really well for them.
[01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:25.200]   And so, you know, unfortunately,
[01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:27.080]   there's no real way to go back in time,
[01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:28.960]   so that we can see what was the best way we sleep.
[01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:31.280]   And it might have been very, very culturally influenced.
[01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:33.880]   So if there was things that you had to do in the middle of the night,
[01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:35.760]   you know, a lot of dangers that were happening,
[01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:37.000]   or something you'd have to do that,
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:38.440]   that would be really important.
[01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:41.680]   Apparently, according to the studies I've read,
[01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:43.160]   this is when people had sex.
[01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:47.800]   Well, in the Samuel Peeps diary from the 1600s,
[01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:51.400]   he talks extensively about getting up at midnight
[01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:54.960]   or two in the morning to go and have a drink with his friends
[01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:57.000]   and come back at four or five in the morning
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:57.800]   to sleep through and--
[01:01:57.800 --> 01:01:59.680]   Yeah, everybody was up at that time.
[01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:01.640]   Wasn't that just so that his wife wouldn't know?
[01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:04.440]   Peeps is a party animal.
[01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:05.440]   Everyone knows that.
[01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:07.560]   (laughing)
[01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:09.480]   That's just so you don't get caught.
[01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:12.600]   Oh, how do you sleep, Ome?
[01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:14.240]   You sleep well?
[01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:18.600]   You know, I sleep in part five hours a night
[01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:23.600]   and take a nap in the evening between six and seven-thirty,
[01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:26.120]   and then go out after that.
[01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:30.280]   Is it the case people all over the world sleep roughly eight hours
[01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:32.080]   between like 11 and seven every--
[01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:33.400]   I mean, isn't that like this?
[01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:36.280]   Is that just a Western standard or is that a standard worldwide?
[01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:38.400]   No, I think pretty much everybody sleeps like that.
[01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:41.720]   Some people sleep less, some people sleep more.
[01:02:41.720 --> 01:02:45.160]   In my case, when I got sick,
[01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:48.000]   my doctor actually pointed out that the reason
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:53.000]   I had high blood pressure was because I was staying up too late
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:58.600]   and that led to my body never actually clocking down
[01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:02.400]   and always being like, you know, in a hyper mode.
[01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:07.400]   And that led to my blood pressure situation.
[01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:10.360]   But all the--
[01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:12.600]   You might be a little bit, your doctor maybe,
[01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:14.640]   maybe not, but you might be a little bit
[01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:18.000]   or misunderstood to that because it's not really about,
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.400]   it's more about the time that you spend to sleep.
[01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:23.400]   So some people are night owls and they like to sleep later.
[01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:25.480]   We've also found that there is a small group of people
[01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:27.920]   that really needs two to four hours of sleep
[01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:29.200]   and that's exceptionally rare.
[01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:30.360]   Not me.
[01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:31.200]   Not me.
[01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:32.040]   But I am a night owl.
[01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:33.360]   I like to stay up to one or two in the morning
[01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:34.360]   and sleep in the morning.
[01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:35.400]   That's kind of my natural.
[01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:37.280]   Yeah, you probably, you do so much,
[01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:39.520]   you're giving such an output during the day
[01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:41.040]   doing these shows and putting it online.
[01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:42.480]   You need to also decompress.
[01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:43.320]   That's also why I'm a drunk.
[01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:47.240]   But what happens, it works, that works.
[01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:49.320]   Though that then will wake you up after three hours.
[01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:51.280]   So it's only a depressant for a certain amount of time.
[01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:52.120]   I know, it doesn't work.
[01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:54.400]   Then it will actually wake you up, it doesn't work very well.
[01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:57.120]   But what happens that will help for your blood pressure on
[01:03:57.120 --> 01:04:00.200]   is that when you're sleeping through the night,
[01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:03.080]   our healing happens mostly when we're rested.
[01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:05.960]   So either low stress or when we're sleeping.
[01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:09.120]   So most of our cellular repair happens at night.
[01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:11.920]   Most of the working also on,
[01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:15.640]   so our brain uses up refuse, so it's like brain poop.
[01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:18.880]   We do most of the cleansing of that also at night.
[01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:22.040]   So we get rid of beta, like amyloid plaques.
[01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:24.640]   And so that will lower your blood pressure as well.
[01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:28.760]   And that happens more during the later part of your sleep.
[01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:31.200]   So if you're shorting yourself two hours of sleep,
[01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:34.520]   you're shorting yourself from two of the most important,
[01:04:34.520 --> 01:04:38.280]   restorative hours of your sleep as well.
[01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:41.120]   - I think this is, I think one of the reasons,
[01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:41.960]   you know, it's really interesting,
[01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:44.880]   because whatever Silicon Valley is obsessed with,
[01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:47.360]   the nations of it, or maybe we just,
[01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:49.600]   our folk get obsessed with it too.
[01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:53.840]   It used to be that stand up comics set the national agenda.
[01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:55.640]   It was all about airline peanuts.
[01:04:55.640 --> 01:04:58.120]   Now it's about things like we're not sleeping well,
[01:04:58.120 --> 01:05:01.120]   we're looking at the phones till the middle of the night.
[01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:07.880]   There's night shift, what's wrong with it?
[01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:10.960]   If you wanna use it, use it, what's the big deal, right?
[01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:13.520]   - I just wanna take the story to the right a little bit,
[01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:15.720]   but I've been having problems with sleeping,
[01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:18.280]   and I've got a sleep disorder of certain type,
[01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:21.040]   and I've been attending a sleep clinic at my local hospital.
[01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:22.080]   - Wow, wow.
[01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:24.320]   - And the thing that stunned me about it
[01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:27.520]   is just how tech savvy these people are.
[01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:29.400]   So for example, when I was doing the diagnosis,
[01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:31.960]   I went to the hospital, and they gave me this kit,
[01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:34.320]   which had a thing on my finger,
[01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:36.760]   had to put a face mask on, and then these bands,
[01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:39.200]   and they could actually calculate my heart rate,
[01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:41.600]   my oxygen levels, and how much my breathing.
[01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:43.560]   And so I took the kit home, plugged them all in,
[01:05:43.560 --> 01:05:44.880]   and then took them back the next day,
[01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:47.000]   they plugged it into the computer, took the data out,
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:50.200]   did a diagnosis instantly, and said,
[01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:51.680]   "We think that you need this."
[01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:53.040]   And now they gave me a machine,
[01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:54.360]   which blows air in my face.
[01:05:54.360 --> 01:05:55.840]   It's a horrendous thing.
[01:05:55.840 --> 01:05:57.560]   It takes weeks to get used to.
[01:05:57.560 --> 01:05:58.400]   - Wait, it's like a fan?
[01:05:58.400 --> 01:05:59.240]   - You look cool.
[01:05:59.240 --> 01:06:00.360]   You look like Darth Vader.
[01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:01.840]   You sound like Darth Vader after, though.
[01:06:01.840 --> 01:06:03.640]   Those are the things that are great.
[01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:04.920]   - Not a CPAP.
[01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:06.400]   You're not talking about that, are you?
[01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:07.520]   - That's right, one of those.
[01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:08.360]   - Okay.
[01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:11.080]   - But my CPAP machine has a 3G modem,
[01:06:11.080 --> 01:06:13.640]   and it dials all my data back to the hospital.
[01:06:13.640 --> 01:06:14.720]   And the guy said to me, he said,
[01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:16.480]   "If you don't use it, I'll know."
[01:06:16.480 --> 01:06:21.280]   And he can actually reprogram the machine from the hospital,
[01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:22.960]   so if he can see that the machine's not working--
[01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:23.800]   - And ladies and gentlemen,
[01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:25.080]   this is why national health
[01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:27.920]   will never be a part of the American lifestyle.
[01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:30.760]   - Well, if you wanna cheat--
[01:06:30.760 --> 01:06:35.320]   - Do doctors in the UK have police powers?
[01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:38.280]   Can he come to your home?
[01:06:38.280 --> 01:06:39.120]   - Imagine that.
[01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:41.240]   I was so stunned that these machines,
[01:06:41.240 --> 01:06:42.720]   I come in, I wear them, I take them back,
[01:06:42.720 --> 01:06:44.280]   the computer analyzes it,
[01:06:44.280 --> 01:06:48.840]   and now my medical team are actually monitoring my sleep
[01:06:48.840 --> 01:06:49.920]   through the CPAP machine,
[01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:52.120]   because it dials up on a 3G modem every day.
[01:06:52.120 --> 01:06:53.560]   And I was just thinking,
[01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:57.040]   that is a real amazing advance in technology.
[01:06:57.040 --> 01:06:58.440]   That doesn't happen in the US,
[01:06:58.440 --> 01:07:00.760]   because CPAP and sleep disorders
[01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:03.720]   are only treated for 90 days under corporate health care.
[01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:05.520]   - Oh, that's interesting, wow.
[01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:06.360]   - They're on your own.
[01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:07.920]   Whereas in the UK, of course,
[01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:09.680]   it's a lifetime disorder or what--
[01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:12.000]   - It's a treatment for sleep apnea, right?
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:15.360]   - Yeah, I've only got a very mild sleep apnea.
[01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:16.680]   I've got some other problems as well,
[01:07:16.680 --> 01:07:19.280]   but I had cancer 30 years ago,
[01:07:19.280 --> 01:07:22.480]   and various things, so my life's a little different.
[01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:23.760]   - That's a phrase you don't hear a lot.
[01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:25.280]   I had cancer 30 years ago.
[01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:27.360]   That's good on you, that's great.
[01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:28.840]   Congratulations. - Yeah, I'm not dead yet.
[01:07:28.840 --> 01:07:29.720]   - Yeah. - I'm not dead yet.
[01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:30.800]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:33.840]   - And this whole panel,
[01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:34.760]   Georgia, how's your health?
[01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:36.080]   Is it okay?
[01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:37.000]   - I'm good right now.
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:38.080]   - Okay, good.
[01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:39.720]   - Thank you.
[01:07:39.720 --> 01:07:41.880]   - Panel is at death's door.
[01:07:41.880 --> 01:07:45.640]   So it's big CPAP data is what you're talking about.
[01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:47.880]   - I just was really surprised about this idea
[01:07:47.880 --> 01:07:50.320]   of using 3G for the medical equipment to--
[01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:51.600]   - Yeah, no, that's cool.
[01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:52.440]   Yeah.
[01:07:52.440 --> 01:07:55.680]   - And then we, of course, it's related to circadian rhythm.
[01:07:55.680 --> 01:07:57.880]   So once you've got a circadian rhythm disorder,
[01:07:57.880 --> 01:08:00.480]   and for me now I go to bed at the same time every night
[01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:02.960]   more or less, regardless of whether I'm tired or not,
[01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:05.080]   and I'm a lot healthier than I used to be,
[01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:07.120]   partly because of flux and the blue light thing
[01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:08.960]   on my screen, which tells me to get the help
[01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:10.600]   to leave the dirty thing alive.
[01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:13.640]   - Oh, did you follow Dr. Zorters?
[01:08:13.640 --> 01:08:16.960]   Are you now going to bed early and relaxing and--
[01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:20.720]   - Yes, no machines in my bedroom.
[01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:21.560]   And--
[01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:23.000]   - I think that's actually a good idea.
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.200]   So you like keep the phone in the laptop out?
[01:08:25.200 --> 01:08:26.280]   - Everything is in there.
[01:08:26.280 --> 01:08:27.920]   - That's actually probably the single.
[01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:30.280]   - You can even turn away your clock.
[01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:31.760]   Even if you're looking at a clock,
[01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:34.040]   you should turn that away so that you can't calculate.
[01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:35.680]   If you're looking in the middle of the night,
[01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:38.080]   everyone wakes up five times a night.
[01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:39.120]   You go through a light wave,
[01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:41.000]   that's when you turn over, go to the washroom.
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:42.400]   And if you're looking at the clock
[01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:44.280]   and calculating how much longer you have sleep,
[01:08:44.280 --> 01:08:46.960]   you're saying, "Oh God, I'm awake again at this time."
[01:08:46.960 --> 01:08:50.320]   That's making your waves hit stronger than beta waves.
[01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:52.320]   And so you'll wake up, wake up.
[01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:53.360]   - How about the Oculus Rift?
[01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:55.200]   Is it okay for me to put that on in the middle of the night
[01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:56.040]   or not?
[01:08:56.040 --> 01:08:59.520]   Is that gonna wake me up?
[01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:01.280]   - The Oculus Rift is awesome.
[01:09:01.280 --> 01:09:02.880]   So I would say yes.
[01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:03.880]   - I wake up, I go--
[01:09:03.880 --> 01:09:04.880]   - I'll be playing that for a few nights.
[01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:07.080]   - I'll just do a little VR.
[01:09:07.080 --> 01:09:09.240]   That'll help me sleep.
[01:09:09.240 --> 01:09:10.080]   - We have a tear down on the--
[01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:11.080]   - So aren't you gonna do Oculus?
[01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:11.920]   - Huh?
[01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:13.600]   - There's a tear down of it in the rundown.
[01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:14.840]   - A tear down of the Oculus Rift?
[01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:15.680]   - Yeah, you're not gonna be able
[01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:17.360]   to get some sleep with that thing on.
[01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:18.720]   (laughing)
[01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:20.280]   - We're getting the Vive next.
[01:09:20.280 --> 01:09:21.520]   - I'm getting the Vive.
[01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:23.840]   - Yeah, somebody told me, I think it was you, Jason,
[01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:26.840]   that there's a way to run the Vive and the Rift together.
[01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:29.720]   - Yeah, upload VR I think is the site that did it.
[01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:30.560]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:31.400]   - Yeah, that's Scobel's site.
[01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:32.240]   - Yeah, Scobel's new site.
[01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:34.440]   They have a story about how they ran both simultaneously
[01:09:34.440 --> 01:09:35.640]   from the same PC.
[01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:37.120]   Different apps, different programs.
[01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:39.360]   - So now Lisa and I can both wear them at night.
[01:09:39.360 --> 01:09:41.080]   - Right, you could be watching Hulu
[01:09:41.080 --> 01:09:42.920]   and she could be watching Netflix.
[01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:44.480]   - And you could be chilling.
[01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:49.000]   - My husband has redone our entire upstairs for the Vive.
[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.560]   Like we've gotten rid of like--
[01:09:51.560 --> 01:09:53.480]   - He's a little overexcited.
[01:09:53.480 --> 01:09:55.440]   - She's got rid of sharp corners.
[01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:57.720]   - Yeah, no, no, no, like there's nothing
[01:09:57.720 --> 01:10:00.200]   in the upstairs right now just for the Vive.
[01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:01.040]   - What?
[01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:01.880]   - And he watches videos constantly,
[01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:03.040]   we might need to have an intervention.
[01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:04.800]   - So do you have a Vive?
[01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:05.880]   - We've ordered it.
[01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:06.720]   - Yeah.
[01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:07.560]   - So we don't have it yet.
[01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:08.400]   - I have no idea.
[01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:09.240]   - Or in Canada, we have to wait for everything.
[01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:11.040]   - No, mine, I'm waiting to.
[01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:13.240]   If you didn't order it right away,
[01:10:13.240 --> 01:10:15.960]   it was they did start going out this week.
[01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:17.360]   Actually, let's take a break, come back
[01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:20.280]   and talk about VR and AR.
[01:10:20.280 --> 01:10:22.360]   And any kind of AR you wanna talk about.
[01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:27.160]   And your sleep and anything else that's on your mind.
[01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:30.560]   I did get, on Kickstarter, I ordered a floating bonsai tree.
[01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:31.720]   I'm excited about that.
[01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:33.840]   - Oh, I've seen it.
[01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:34.680]   - Yeah.
[01:10:34.680 --> 01:10:35.520]   - I've seen that.
[01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:38.720]   - Yeah, it's using magnets to float the bonsai tree.
[01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:39.560]   - It looks amazing.
[01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:41.080]   - I'm sure I'll get that.
[01:10:41.080 --> 01:10:46.520]   - I have the Mars wave that's amazing as well.
[01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:49.000]   It floats, it's like a speaker system that floats.
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:50.440]   And it's, it's fun to be cool.
[01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:53.200]   - You have a Kickstarter habit as well, I can see.
[01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:54.720]   - Well, they sent it to me, but yeah.
[01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:57.760]   - Maybe that's my mistake.
[01:10:57.760 --> 01:10:58.880]   They know I'm an easy mark.
[01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:00.040]   They're gonna send me anything.
[01:11:00.040 --> 01:11:00.880]   There it is.
[01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:01.880]   - That's how I love it.
[01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:03.840]   - That's amazing.
[01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:05.480]   - Can I have that in my room?
[01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:07.280]   - Yeah.
[01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:08.600]   - Yeah. - It's not a machine.
[01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:09.920]   - It's very relaxing.
[01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:12.840]   - You can watch it grow.
[01:11:12.840 --> 01:11:14.640]   Count the leaves in the middle of the night.
[01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:18.000]   - Tick, tick, tick, tick.
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:19.000]   - I would spin it, though.
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:19.840]   - Long as you don't like the thing.
[01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:20.680]   - Yes, spinning bonsai.
[01:11:20.680 --> 01:11:22.040]   - Oh, yeah, you could do that.
[01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:25.360]   - So it actually worked out?
[01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:27.160]   - Yeah, well, it kick started it,
[01:11:27.160 --> 01:11:29.160]   which means I may get it or may not.
[01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:30.800]   It's kind of the fun part of that kick start.
[01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:33.760]   It's kind of like Russian roulette with gadgets.
[01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:35.720]   You might get it.
[01:11:35.720 --> 01:11:37.240]   - I always get sad when I don't get them though.
[01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:38.720]   So that makes me.
[01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:40.520]   - Oh, I have a lot of, I got over that.
[01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:41.520]   I have a lot of gadgets.
[01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:44.160]   - Did you, I still have been waiting for the ring clock.
[01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:45.560]   - Yeah, there's a lot of stuff.
[01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:47.000]   - The little clock that was the ring, it looked amazing.
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:48.120]   - Yeah.
[01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:49.600]   And then the worst though is you get it
[01:11:49.600 --> 01:11:51.000]   and it was just like crap.
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:54.400]   - Yes.
[01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:57.600]   - Okay, I ordered these, yeah, there you go, see?
[01:11:57.600 --> 01:12:01.120]   I ordered these NFC rings.
[01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:02.520]   I don't know why I was thinking,
[01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:05.160]   but they haven't seen them and you could like--
[01:12:05.160 --> 01:12:06.000]   - What would you do with these rings?
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:07.960]   - I don't know, swipe your phone on it or something.
[01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:11.320]   And then they put fingerprint locks on the phones
[01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:12.960]   and I didn't need it anymore.
[01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:13.800]   I'm still waiting. - I'm still waiting
[01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:15.920]   to get these little rings so you can give them as gifts.
[01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:18.960]   - I'm still waiting for, I ordered two years ago,
[01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:23.640]   a modular smartphone case for the iPhone 5S.
[01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:24.480]   (laughs)
[01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:25.320]   - Oh no.
[01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:28.280]   - And I may get it, but then who cares?
[01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:30.640]   - No, but now you can use the iPhone 5.
[01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:32.640]   - Yeah, the SE.
[01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:34.520]   Our show today brought to you by Stamps.com.
[01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:37.320]   If you are going to the post office for any reason whatsoever,
[01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:39.000]   but especially if you're going for business,
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.920]   you should know about Stamps.com.
[01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:43.960]   Look, the Postal Service is great.
[01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:46.280]   I mean, they deliver.
[01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:49.000]   The problem is you got a job to do,
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.160]   you're selling on eBay or Etsy or Amazon
[01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:53.080]   and you want to get, you know, fulfill that
[01:12:53.080 --> 01:12:56.120]   or maybe you're sending out invoices or brochures.
[01:12:56.120 --> 01:12:58.760]   You don't want to go to wait in line for stamps or worse.
[01:12:58.760 --> 01:13:01.440]   Please don't go out and get a postage meter.
[01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:02.880]   Those things are ridiculous.
[01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:06.160]   They charge you for the ink and they rent.
[01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:09.000]   Stamps.com, you use your computer and your printer
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.320]   and no special ink and you just print the postage.

[01:13:19.480 --> 01:13:22.280]   which means you will always get exactly the right postage.
[01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:24.080]   And you can print right on the envelopes

[01:13:26.160 --> 01:13:29.080]   but your return address is automatically printed on there,
[01:13:29.080 --> 01:13:31.840]   your company logo if you want.

[01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:33.600]   I love this scale.
[01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:35.440]   Here's Carly opening up the scale.
[01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:37.640]   This is part of our special offer.
[01:13:37.640 --> 01:13:38.840]   So it's a USB scale.
[01:13:38.840 --> 01:13:41.160]   You plug it into your USB port.
[01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:43.160]   The exact amount of postage you need will appear
[01:13:43.160 --> 01:13:44.880]   on your computer screen and it even does things
[01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:47.080]   like suggest alternatives.

[01:13:48.200 --> 01:13:50.760]   You could send it media mail and save a buck.
[01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:52.280]   You're gonna really like this.
[01:13:52.280 --> 01:13:54.160]   There's things you can do with stamps.com discounts

[01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:13.720]   international customs forms, automatically printed,
[01:14:13.720 --> 01:14:16.400]   taking the information right from the webpage.

[01:15:10.760 --> 01:15:16.360]   What are you thinking about these days, Omelette?
[01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:18.080]   I shouldn't just, I shouldn't be the only one
[01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:19.160]   setting up the,
[01:15:19.160 --> 01:15:22.940]   queuing up the pins for your bowling ball.
[01:15:22.940 --> 01:15:25.400]   - What do you mean?
[01:15:25.400 --> 01:15:26.640]   - I don't know what I mean.
[01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:28.600]   I have no idea what I mean.
[01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:30.040]   I need sleep.
[01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:32.960]   I mean, what are you doing these days, Omelette?
[01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:34.040]   What are you working on?
[01:15:34.040 --> 01:15:34.880]   What is this?
[01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:37.960]   - I love your mind.
[01:15:37.960 --> 01:15:38.960]   - It just doesn't work.
[01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:39.800]   It didn't work.
[01:15:39.800 --> 01:15:42.280]   I could tell halfway through it wasn't gonna work,
[01:15:42.280 --> 01:15:43.120]   but I was stuck.
[01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:44.640]   - I thought you went fully for it.
[01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:45.480]   - Well, you have to.
[01:15:45.480 --> 01:15:46.640]   You can't just say, I would never mind.
[01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:48.560]   You have to finish the sentence.
[01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:50.080]   As bad as it might be.
[01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:54.360]   See, that's nice about, Omelette's nice about being a writer
[01:15:54.360 --> 01:15:58.280]   is you're in backspace and start another metaphor.
[01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:00.640]   - It's your show.
[01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:01.800]   You can do whatever you want.
[01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:04.600]   - When you write for the New Yorker,
[01:16:04.600 --> 01:16:05.840]   they're famous for their facts.
[01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:07.720]   Do they still have facts checking?
[01:16:07.720 --> 01:16:09.160]   - I think they do.
[01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:12.520]   - A lot of places they got rid of facts to fact check in.
[01:16:12.520 --> 01:16:14.920]   - A lot of places got rid of facts.
[01:16:14.920 --> 01:16:16.440]   - Yeah, that's true too.
[01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:19.120]   - Our presidential candidate got rid of facts.
[01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:21.080]   - Yeah, who needs facts?
[01:16:21.080 --> 01:16:22.160]   - Yeah, the facts.
[01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:23.920]   - Like Mashable this week.
[01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:26.320]   - Oh my God, what happened?
[01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:28.400]   - Mashable just completely wiped out
[01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:30.320]   any original content on politics.
[01:16:30.320 --> 01:16:33.960]   - 30 people, including the New York Times editor
[01:16:33.960 --> 01:16:36.200]   who jumped ship to go over there.
[01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:39.480]   Wow.
[01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:41.960]   Do you have any insight?
[01:16:41.960 --> 01:16:44.440]   Of course, Ome's been through this a little bit.
[01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:47.360]   - That is mean.
[01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:49.840]   - That is just mean, I'm sorry.
[01:16:49.840 --> 01:16:51.360]   - You're getting back at me now, I know.
[01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:52.640]   - No, no, no, no.
[01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:55.380]   I don't mean to bring up anything painful.
[01:16:56.220 --> 01:17:00.300]   By the way, when you click on Jim Roberts biography
[01:17:00.300 --> 01:17:03.300]   on Mashable, he became executive editor
[01:17:03.300 --> 01:17:05.660]   and chief content officer left in New York Times to do this.
[01:17:05.660 --> 01:17:08.500]   When you click on his biography, this is what you get.
[01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:12.760]   So I don't think he works there anymore.
[01:17:12.760 --> 01:17:17.420]   Do is any insight anybody on what happened there?
[01:17:17.420 --> 01:17:22.340]   - Nothing.
[01:17:22.340 --> 01:17:25.340]   - From what I read, they were going to go all into video.
[01:17:25.340 --> 01:17:28.260]   Like they want to become very much like BuzzFeed
[01:17:28.260 --> 01:17:31.940]   and do short from video because video is where
[01:17:31.940 --> 01:17:33.620]   all the dollars are now.
[01:17:33.620 --> 01:17:37.620]   - Isn't there a risk though, for any journalistic enterprise,
[01:17:37.620 --> 01:17:40.140]   just chasing what's big today?
[01:17:40.140 --> 01:17:44.940]   You know, I mean, I hate to see them do that
[01:17:44.940 --> 01:17:49.460]   because BuzzFeed and Vicer are already there, right?
[01:17:49.460 --> 01:17:51.980]   - No, but like they're going back to what they were doing
[01:17:51.980 --> 01:17:56.100]   known for writing about technology, social technology,
[01:17:56.100 --> 01:17:57.700]   social services and stuff.
[01:17:57.700 --> 01:17:59.500]   - No more politics, no more news.
[01:17:59.500 --> 01:18:02.380]   - Yeah, and I think they were not known for politics
[01:18:02.380 --> 01:18:05.540]   and news per se and it makes sense for them
[01:18:05.540 --> 01:18:06.700]   to go back to their roots.
[01:18:06.700 --> 01:18:11.300]   I don't, I mean, you kind of feel for people
[01:18:11.300 --> 01:18:14.420]   who lost their jobs, but from a business standpoint,
[01:18:14.420 --> 01:18:17.820]   I think this is a more logical move for them to make.
[01:18:17.820 --> 01:18:20.540]   But the world is just like, you have to be very focused
[01:18:20.540 --> 01:18:23.300]   on what you're good at.
[01:18:23.300 --> 01:18:25.940]   And they were just all over the map as a service.
[01:18:25.940 --> 01:18:29.140]   - Yeah, I felt like, maybe, and obviously wrong,
[01:18:29.140 --> 01:18:33.700]   but I felt like, I saw Mashable links everywhere.
[01:18:33.700 --> 01:18:36.100]   I mean, they seemed like they were, you know,
[01:18:36.100 --> 01:18:39.100]   really getting the word out, a lot of sharing.
[01:18:39.100 --> 01:18:41.980]   Maybe right to focus on the viral content.
[01:18:41.980 --> 01:18:43.980]   - I think, you know, the thing,
[01:18:43.980 --> 01:18:46.860]   you see there links everywhere.
[01:18:46.860 --> 01:18:49.620]   I don't know who told me this,
[01:18:49.620 --> 01:18:52.860]   is somewhat like, you know, things appear larger
[01:18:52.860 --> 01:18:54.980]   on social media than they really are.
[01:18:54.980 --> 01:18:56.500]   - Ah, that's true.
[01:18:56.500 --> 01:18:59.500]   - And I think a lot of the times we forget
[01:18:59.500 --> 01:19:01.340]   the reality is very, very different.
[01:19:01.340 --> 01:19:04.380]   And I think that's where, you know, it'd be interesting
[01:19:04.380 --> 01:19:06.900]   to see how they come back to their core
[01:19:06.900 --> 01:19:09.260]   and how well they come back to their core.
[01:19:09.260 --> 01:19:13.980]   You know, I think as a neutral bystander,
[01:19:13.980 --> 01:19:17.380]   I'm looking forward to what happens there next.
[01:19:17.380 --> 01:19:21.580]   - It is a very, I mean, it is a very volatile market
[01:19:21.580 --> 01:19:22.420]   right now.
[01:19:22.420 --> 01:19:25.140]   Now, we're staring at Facebook's F8 conference
[01:19:25.140 --> 01:19:27.900]   coming at us on Tuesday.
[01:19:27.900 --> 01:19:32.900]   Facebook increasingly dominating this market.
[01:19:32.900 --> 01:19:35.500]   And I would, you know, this Mashable move has a lot to do
[01:19:35.500 --> 01:19:38.940]   with, you know, how do you get drive traffic on Facebook?
[01:19:38.940 --> 01:19:42.420]   And sites like Buzzfeed and I would say even Vice,
[01:19:42.420 --> 01:19:46.020]   much less interested in driving traffic to their homepage.
[01:19:46.020 --> 01:19:46.940]   They don't care.
[01:19:46.940 --> 01:19:51.660]   Buzzfeed doesn't even have a homepage anymore, right?
[01:19:51.660 --> 01:19:53.180]   - Well, they do.
[01:19:53.180 --> 01:19:56.060]   - But they don't expect you to go to it.
[01:19:56.060 --> 01:19:58.380]   - They don't, but like I think their whole model
[01:19:58.380 --> 01:20:02.060]   has been a very atomized way of, you know,
[01:20:02.060 --> 01:20:03.340]   spreading their content.
[01:20:03.340 --> 01:20:05.900]   So they're doing a good job.
[01:20:05.900 --> 01:20:09.460]   I think, you know, both walks and Buzzfeed
[01:20:09.460 --> 01:20:11.540]   have done a good job and so has Mike.
[01:20:11.540 --> 01:20:13.620]   And I'll tell you the biggest challenge
[01:20:13.620 --> 01:20:17.660]   for all these companies is going to be on Facebook
[01:20:17.660 --> 01:20:21.340]   is that they will all be competing for the same space
[01:20:21.340 --> 01:20:24.740]   on the newsfeed as everybody else.
[01:20:24.740 --> 01:20:27.260]   And I think it becomes very challenging.
[01:20:27.260 --> 01:20:29.020]   And what I mean by everybody else,
[01:20:29.020 --> 01:20:32.700]   it means your baby pose, your advertising,
[01:20:32.700 --> 01:20:36.820]   your, you know, your music posts from Spotify
[01:20:36.820 --> 01:20:40.420]   and all those things which go into your feed
[01:20:40.420 --> 01:20:44.580]   is everything is going to have an equal amount of ranking.
[01:20:44.580 --> 01:20:46.980]   And that's going to cause, you know,
[01:20:46.980 --> 01:20:49.860]   all these services to have a moment of reckoning.
[01:20:49.860 --> 01:20:53.420]   I think the news organizations who are heavily dependent
[01:20:53.420 --> 01:20:58.180]   on Facebook will have a moment of reckoning in my opinion.
[01:20:58.180 --> 01:21:00.500]   - Facebook itself struggling a little bit according
[01:21:00.500 --> 01:21:04.100]   to an exclusive in the information Amira Friday writing
[01:21:04.100 --> 01:21:08.740]   that they're suffering from a decline in original sharing
[01:21:08.740 --> 01:21:11.260]   that in fact it isn't the baby pictures anymore
[01:21:11.260 --> 01:21:13.380]   that fewer people are posting on Facebook,
[01:21:13.380 --> 01:21:16.900]   more personal content is now going to Snapchat,
[01:21:16.900 --> 01:21:20.500]   Instagram, Twitter and other places.
[01:21:20.500 --> 01:21:25.500]   In some ways perhaps the news services pushing out
[01:21:25.500 --> 01:21:27.540]   the personal content.
[01:21:27.540 --> 01:21:30.620]   And I have to say I see that on my Facebook page,
[01:21:30.620 --> 01:21:33.700]   absolutely, what I used to be a place I'd go
[01:21:33.700 --> 01:21:37.300]   to catch up on family and friends is really now a newsfeed.
[01:21:38.580 --> 01:21:40.020]   I love that image there.
[01:21:40.020 --> 01:21:40.860]   - Which of Mark Zuckerberg.
[01:21:40.860 --> 01:21:43.460]   - I love the one I know down at the bottom, right there.
[01:21:43.460 --> 01:21:47.500]   - Facebook 2005, a beach with people playing volleyball
[01:21:47.500 --> 01:21:50.460]   and now it looks like Times Square.
[01:21:50.460 --> 01:21:53.140]   I don't know if that's quite fair.
[01:21:53.140 --> 01:21:57.860]   Says about 57% of Facebook users who use the app every week
[01:21:57.860 --> 01:22:00.700]   post at least once in a given week.
[01:22:00.700 --> 01:22:04.340]   This is confidential data that the information got a hold of.
[01:22:04.340 --> 01:22:08.300]   But only 39% of weekly active users post original content.
[01:22:08.300 --> 01:22:11.180]   A lot of it is reposts, reshares.
[01:22:11.180 --> 01:22:14.260]   And 6% of weekly active people post it to a specific group
[01:22:14.260 --> 01:22:16.260]   of friends as opposed to the newsfeed.
[01:22:16.260 --> 01:22:19.060]   So people aren't using those friends lists.
[01:22:19.060 --> 01:22:19.900]   They're just posting.
[01:22:19.900 --> 01:22:21.820]   - I think the article highlights the fact
[01:22:21.820 --> 01:22:25.580]   that it's the next generation who are not using Facebook.
[01:22:25.580 --> 01:22:29.860]   So younger people under 25 have already abandoned Facebook
[01:22:29.860 --> 01:22:31.540]   for other platforms and that's the problem
[01:22:31.540 --> 01:22:32.620]   that Facebook has got.
[01:22:32.620 --> 01:22:35.180]   - It's not that they're abandoning it, they're still there,
[01:22:35.180 --> 01:22:36.740]   but they're not posting.
[01:22:36.740 --> 01:22:39.380]   - No, and no, they're not using it either.
[01:22:39.380 --> 01:22:42.620]   So in the first world, so Europe and America.
[01:22:42.620 --> 01:22:47.140]   So recently I gave a talk at a school about social media
[01:22:47.140 --> 01:22:49.580]   and being safe online and things like that.
[01:22:49.580 --> 01:22:50.580]   It was a wide forum.
[01:22:50.580 --> 01:22:52.900]   There's about 500 kids in the room.
[01:22:52.900 --> 01:22:53.780]   And I said to them,
[01:22:53.780 --> 01:22:56.180]   how many people here put use Facebook
[01:22:56.180 --> 01:22:57.140]   and they all put their hands up.
[01:22:57.140 --> 01:22:59.500]   I said, how many of you have posted on it in the last week
[01:22:59.500 --> 01:23:00.300]   and no one put their hands up?
[01:23:00.300 --> 01:23:01.300]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:23:01.300 --> 01:23:02.500]   - They don't put anything on Facebook
[01:23:02.500 --> 01:23:04.100]   because grandma's watching, right?
[01:23:04.100 --> 01:23:06.460]   They don't want to put pictures of them kissing their
[01:23:06.460 --> 01:23:07.940]   boyfriend of two weeks.
[01:23:07.940 --> 01:23:09.460]   - Well, also they're using Snapchat.
[01:23:09.460 --> 01:23:12.180]   You only have so much time.
[01:23:12.180 --> 01:23:14.020]   And if they're really using Snapchat,
[01:23:14.020 --> 01:23:15.500]   which I bet they are, right?
[01:23:15.500 --> 01:23:17.980]   - Yeah, my teenage daughters are using,
[01:23:17.980 --> 01:23:20.580]   I spoke to my, I have two teenage daughters,
[01:23:20.580 --> 01:23:22.020]   one's 15, one's 18.
[01:23:22.020 --> 01:23:25.060]   And their consumption of Snapchat boggles my mind.
[01:23:25.060 --> 01:23:29.420]   They will make like 250 posts a day on Snapchat.
[01:23:29.420 --> 01:23:32.220]   They'll literally just take a photo of themselves
[01:23:32.220 --> 01:23:34.300]   endlessly every 10 minutes
[01:23:34.300 --> 01:23:37.820]   or continuously post or react or like.
[01:23:37.820 --> 01:23:39.940]   And they don't put that on Facebook
[01:23:39.940 --> 01:23:43.580]   because Facebook lasts forever as Snapchat goes away.
[01:23:43.580 --> 01:23:44.980]   It's a conversation.
[01:23:44.980 --> 01:23:47.500]   And I think Facebook's missing out on the fact
[01:23:47.500 --> 01:23:49.420]   that all of media is a conversation.
[01:23:49.420 --> 01:23:50.500]   It's two way.
[01:23:50.500 --> 01:23:52.140]   It's not broadcast.
[01:23:52.140 --> 01:23:54.500]   And what Facebook's trying to be is a platform
[01:23:54.500 --> 01:23:55.580]   that pushes it out.
[01:23:55.580 --> 01:23:58.380]   I know also like our podcast,
[01:23:58.380 --> 01:24:00.140]   we work directly with big companies
[01:24:00.140 --> 01:24:02.380]   with billion dollar marketing budgets.
[01:24:02.380 --> 01:24:04.280]   And their problem is that they're marketing
[01:24:04.280 --> 01:24:06.980]   has to compete in the Facebook news feed
[01:24:06.980 --> 01:24:10.420]   with news articles, baby photos and so forth.
[01:24:10.420 --> 01:24:13.620]   And they cannot find a way to make Facebook work
[01:24:13.620 --> 01:24:15.140]   for them with that money.
[01:24:15.140 --> 01:24:16.460]   Facebook's problem is coming at it
[01:24:16.460 --> 01:24:18.200]   from multiple points of view.
[01:24:18.200 --> 01:24:20.800]   Now, keep in mind that Facebook's got plenty of growth,
[01:24:20.800 --> 01:24:24.980]   Indonesia, India, China, wherever you wanna be.
[01:24:24.980 --> 01:24:26.940]   There's plenty of growth going on in those countries
[01:24:26.940 --> 01:24:28.540]   as new adopters come on.
[01:24:28.540 --> 01:24:31.260]   But I do sometimes wonder if Facebook's reaching
[01:24:31.260 --> 01:24:33.900]   a mature phase in some markets
[01:24:33.900 --> 01:24:36.240]   where the high dollar value is,
[01:24:36.240 --> 01:24:39.880]   as people start to fight to get into that feed.
[01:24:39.880 --> 01:24:41.760]   And this is where media's coming across,
[01:24:41.760 --> 01:24:44.720]   'cause it's competing as much with marketing efforts
[01:24:44.720 --> 01:24:49.360]   as news efforts, as mashable producing low quality video
[01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:52.200]   rubbish that drive clicks as anything else.
[01:24:52.200 --> 01:24:55.920]   And then eventually you end up with free newspaper
[01:24:55.920 --> 01:24:59.560]   being distributed on the underground on us every day.
[01:24:59.560 --> 01:25:03.120]   - How much?
[01:25:03.120 --> 01:25:07.180]   - I think there is one counter point to that,
[01:25:07.180 --> 01:25:12.180]   that in 2014 average time spent on Facebook per month
[01:25:12.180 --> 01:25:17.840]   was 40 minutes and in 2015 it was 46 minutes.
[01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:22.880]   So even with an increased number of users
[01:25:22.880 --> 01:25:27.880]   and decreased quantity of original content,
[01:25:28.560 --> 01:25:33.560]   we've had more usage in Facebook regardless
[01:25:33.560 --> 01:25:36.760]   of how we all feel about it.
[01:25:36.760 --> 01:25:40.960]   - It feels-- - I also feel that,
[01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:47.520]   as a service, I think if there is anyone
[01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:51.120]   who can figure out how to find the ideal blend,
[01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:54.200]   it would be them because of all the data they have.
[01:25:54.200 --> 01:25:56.840]   And from what I'm pretty confident of that.
[01:25:58.080 --> 01:26:03.080]   It seems like Facebook is looking to get more content
[01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:05.440]   from media than ever before.
[01:26:05.440 --> 01:26:09.800]   They started the live video streaming this week
[01:26:09.800 --> 01:26:12.000]   through the iPhone.
[01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:16.160]   Anybody can stream live and they've announced
[01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:19.000]   that they're gonna allow advertising.
[01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:24.000]   They're encouraging with Facebook articles
[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:25.880]   that people post to Facebook.
[01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:27.200]   I thought it was very interesting,
[01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:32.200]   that a lot of news sites like the All
[01:26:32.200 --> 01:26:34.960]   are gonna move to Medium.
[01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:37.680]   And then Medium has tools to automatically do instant
[01:26:37.680 --> 01:26:40.440]   articles on Facebook and AMP,
[01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:43.400]   Google's a sped up browser built in.
[01:26:43.400 --> 01:26:46.520]   So if you're a news publisher,
[01:26:46.520 --> 01:26:48.880]   you don't need a content management system.
[01:26:48.880 --> 01:26:52.680]   You just have everybody post on your Medium page
[01:26:52.680 --> 01:26:54.520]   and it'll automatically go to instant articles.
[01:26:54.520 --> 01:26:56.080]   It'll automatically be AMP'd.
[01:26:56.920 --> 01:26:58.760]   I think that's really an interesting play.
[01:26:58.760 --> 01:27:00.840]   It feels like there's a move,
[01:27:00.840 --> 01:27:04.280]   really such a move from mainstream or traditional media
[01:27:04.280 --> 01:27:07.920]   onto these platforms that of course it's pushing out,
[01:27:07.920 --> 01:27:10.720]   you know, teenagers who are just gonna use Snapchat anyway.
[01:27:10.720 --> 01:27:11.560]   But they're not a,
[01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:12.760]   I think your point is well taken,
[01:27:12.760 --> 01:27:14.240]   they're not abandoning Facebook,
[01:27:14.240 --> 01:27:17.200]   they're just not contributing to it, they're reading it.
[01:27:17.200 --> 01:27:21.200]   - My reaction to that would be is that Facebook has,
[01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:24.320]   like usage of the Facebook feed has dropped,
[01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:27.600]   but that's been offset by usage in Instagram.
[01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:30.640]   Tools like Instagram or Messenger is a separate app.
[01:27:30.640 --> 01:27:32.680]   I'd love to get hold of the data and drill in and say,
[01:27:32.680 --> 01:27:34.880]   "Have people replaced feed time?"
[01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:38.520]   You know, the news feed with time spent in Instagram
[01:27:38.520 --> 01:27:41.200]   or in Messenger using it as a telephone call system
[01:27:41.200 --> 01:27:43.160]   or whether there's some sort of actual,
[01:27:43.160 --> 01:27:46.800]   I would think given the discussions I've had,
[01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:48.640]   is that feed time has dropped dramatically,
[01:27:48.640 --> 01:27:52.640]   but people are spending more time engaging with the Facebook
[01:27:52.640 --> 01:27:55.560]   as an audio tool or as a picture tool.
[01:27:55.560 --> 01:27:59.640]   - I think that they have to be really careful.
[01:27:59.640 --> 01:28:02.520]   When you see the people that use the internet the most,
[01:28:02.520 --> 01:28:05.120]   which are teens, they use the greatest time on the internet
[01:28:05.120 --> 01:28:06.840]   and social media and they're the ones
[01:28:06.840 --> 01:28:08.640]   that are not adopting to Facebook,
[01:28:08.640 --> 01:28:11.560]   being active, participating members, more like,
[01:28:11.560 --> 01:28:12.800]   that's the way that they check in,
[01:28:12.800 --> 01:28:15.160]   their grandparents check in to make sure that they're okay
[01:28:15.160 --> 01:28:16.760]   or they send family messages.
[01:28:16.760 --> 01:28:18.760]   I think that that's something that Facebook is trying
[01:28:18.760 --> 01:28:21.920]   to still be trendy with the next generation
[01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:25.280]   of users and so I think that they have a little bit
[01:28:25.280 --> 01:28:29.200]   of a competition in versus Snapchat is cool,
[01:28:29.200 --> 01:28:32.320]   trendy, fun, effortless, they don't have to worry,
[01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:34.280]   they can post almost anything without worry
[01:28:34.280 --> 01:28:37.200]   about rapid distribution, whereas they look at Facebook
[01:28:37.200 --> 01:28:39.840]   as this is your parents watching you the entire time
[01:28:39.840 --> 01:28:41.920]   and so we have to be careful using it,
[01:28:41.920 --> 01:28:45.280]   so they don't have that same amount of fun and or freedom
[01:28:45.280 --> 01:28:47.800]   plus Facebook's privacy policies have given people
[01:28:47.800 --> 01:28:51.080]   a little bit of pause and I think that these are the issues
[01:28:51.080 --> 01:28:55.200]   that are slowly coming back to kind of haunt them.
[01:28:55.200 --> 01:28:58.320]   - It's not just parents too, it's teachers, employers,
[01:28:58.320 --> 01:28:59.840]   insurance companies. - Yes, that's a very good point.
[01:28:59.840 --> 01:29:02.160]   - Yeah, you know, your future employer,
[01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:05.640]   your past employers, you know, anything,
[01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:07.760]   you can even get calendar systems
[01:29:07.760 --> 01:29:09.760]   that automatically look up somebody's Facebook account
[01:29:09.760 --> 01:29:11.560]   and tells you where they're working now.
[01:29:11.560 --> 01:29:12.880]   (laughing)
[01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:16.240]   - Right, that day that you said you were sick,
[01:29:16.240 --> 01:29:18.520]   you can't see pictures of you on the beach.
[01:29:19.800 --> 01:29:21.320]   - Well, Facebook, you know, we're gonna watch
[01:29:21.320 --> 01:29:22.880]   with great interest what they say at F8.
[01:29:22.880 --> 01:29:24.520]   I mean, one of the things that supposedly
[01:29:24.520 --> 01:29:28.560]   they'll be introducing at F8 is a chat bot platform
[01:29:28.560 --> 01:29:31.760]   that they're gonna, it just feels like Facebook is in many ways
[01:29:31.760 --> 01:29:36.360]   going more towards a corporate publishers, corporate content,
[01:29:36.360 --> 01:29:38.520]   this chatbot platform, chatbot platform,
[01:29:38.520 --> 01:29:41.480]   isn't for end users, it's for, well, it is in a way,
[01:29:41.480 --> 01:29:43.600]   it's for end users to communicate with big companies,
[01:29:43.600 --> 01:29:46.680]   so they're going to, they have developers
[01:29:46.680 --> 01:29:48.280]   that they're going to connect the big companies
[01:29:48.280 --> 01:29:50.760]   with who will create bots for these big companies.
[01:29:50.760 --> 01:29:52.360]   So when you need customer support
[01:29:52.360 --> 01:29:55.160]   or you wanna buy something, you can go into Messenger
[01:29:55.160 --> 01:29:59.480]   and say, hey LL Bean, I need a couple of pairs of moccasins
[01:29:59.480 --> 01:30:01.880]   and a bot will respond to you.
[01:30:01.880 --> 01:30:04.000]   I find that-- - Sounds like such a nightmare.
[01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:05.880]   (laughing)
[01:30:05.880 --> 01:30:08.160]   - But that is so-- - I love calling a company
[01:30:08.160 --> 01:30:10.320]   and talking to a real person.
[01:30:10.320 --> 01:30:11.960]   - Oh, get over it, 'cause that ain't,
[01:30:11.960 --> 01:30:13.320]   that's going away.
[01:30:13.320 --> 01:30:15.880]   You see how hard they make it for you, press six.
[01:30:15.880 --> 01:30:17.240]   - I just keep on dialing, I--
[01:30:17.240 --> 01:30:20.880]   - Dial one a thousand times or zero a thousand times
[01:30:20.880 --> 01:30:24.520]   and eventually, oh for humans.
[01:30:24.520 --> 01:30:27.600]   - Some human will appear, say, what do you want?
[01:30:27.600 --> 01:30:28.500]   I'm busy.
[01:30:28.500 --> 01:30:35.040]   According to CNBC, Michelle Castillo writing on the CNBC page,
[01:30:35.040 --> 01:30:38.720]   the NFL went to Twitter and not Facebook because,
[01:30:38.720 --> 01:30:40.080]   and this is from sources who spoke
[01:30:40.080 --> 01:30:42.160]   on the condition of anonymity,
[01:30:42.160 --> 01:30:45.640]   the NFL faced book undervalued content rights
[01:30:45.640 --> 01:30:48.400]   and had a poor monetization model.
[01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:50.720]   So the NFL, I mean Facebook Live was built
[01:30:50.720 --> 01:30:51.880]   for something like the NFL,
[01:30:51.880 --> 01:30:54.960]   but Thursday Night Football is gonna be oddly enough
[01:30:54.960 --> 01:30:56.400]   on Twitter.
[01:30:56.400 --> 01:30:59.600]   Twitter's gonna stream 10 games next season.
[01:30:59.600 --> 01:31:04.320]   And it would have probably more naturally gone to Facebook.
[01:31:04.320 --> 01:31:07.640]   I don't know how Twitter's gonna stream the NFL.
[01:31:07.640 --> 01:31:09.000]   That makes no sense at all.
[01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:13.480]   - Twitter's got more money than Facebook.
[01:31:13.480 --> 01:31:14.440]   That's all that says.
[01:31:14.440 --> 01:31:16.800]   - Now it says a source with knowledge of Facebook.
[01:31:16.800 --> 01:31:19.640]   They only spent 10 million and according to other stories,
[01:31:19.640 --> 01:31:22.800]   there were offers to the NFL for 15 million.
[01:31:22.800 --> 01:31:24.640]   - For one game versus--
[01:31:24.640 --> 01:31:26.680]   - No, for 10 games, a million a game.
[01:31:26.680 --> 01:31:29.400]   - Yeah, it's a million a game versus when, you know,
[01:31:29.400 --> 01:31:31.160]   like a CNBC, like another--
[01:31:31.160 --> 01:31:32.520]   - Oh, it's much more for broadcast.
[01:31:32.520 --> 01:31:34.760]   - It's like 17 million for one game.
[01:31:34.760 --> 01:31:35.840]   - So this ain't about money.
[01:31:35.840 --> 01:31:38.520]   This is about digital platforms
[01:31:38.520 --> 01:31:40.520]   and thinking ahead to the future.
[01:31:40.520 --> 01:31:42.000]   - Where's it gonna play?
[01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:43.680]   Like where are you? - In the Twitter feed.
[01:31:43.680 --> 01:31:44.520]   - Just in the Twitter feed.
[01:31:44.520 --> 01:31:45.360]   - I don't know. - You can watch it in the blog.
[01:31:45.360 --> 01:31:46.440]   - That's what I'm asking.
[01:31:46.440 --> 01:31:47.280]   - Yeah, that's just a sign.
[01:31:47.280 --> 01:31:48.560]   - Maybe on Periscope, I don't know.
[01:31:48.560 --> 01:31:49.400]   - Yeah, it doesn't make any sense.
[01:31:49.400 --> 01:31:52.120]   - There'll be vertical video of the 50-yard line
[01:31:52.120 --> 01:31:53.320]   and you'll be, I don't know.
[01:31:53.320 --> 01:31:54.160]   - Yeah.
[01:31:54.160 --> 01:31:55.280]   - A source with according to the CNBC,
[01:31:55.280 --> 01:31:56.960]   a source of the knowledge of Facebook's thinking
[01:31:56.960 --> 01:31:59.680]   said the social net work was the one to back out
[01:31:59.680 --> 01:32:02.160]   of the NFL offer, not the other way around.
[01:32:02.160 --> 01:32:06.000]   The main point of contention was over the value of non-exclusive.
[01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:07.680]   And that's the point, livestreamed games,
[01:32:07.680 --> 01:32:09.440]   which are also widely available on TV.
[01:32:09.440 --> 01:32:11.080]   So it doesn't mean Thursday and that football
[01:32:11.080 --> 01:32:13.200]   will only be on Twitter.
[01:32:13.200 --> 01:32:15.120]   Amazon also backed out of the deal.
[01:32:15.120 --> 01:32:17.240]   Leaving Twitter is one of the last players standing.
[01:32:17.240 --> 01:32:18.280]   So there's some dispute.
[01:32:18.280 --> 01:32:21.340]   A spokesman for the NFL strongly disputed this claim.
[01:32:21.340 --> 01:32:24.440]   So just more, more.
[01:32:24.440 --> 01:32:25.600]   - But who would want to watch,
[01:32:25.600 --> 01:32:26.800]   like if you're gonna watch it,
[01:32:26.800 --> 01:32:28.480]   like besides if you were at work,
[01:32:28.480 --> 01:32:30.680]   which I can understand that you're gonna use anything
[01:32:30.680 --> 01:32:32.440]   or Twitter in that purpose,
[01:32:32.440 --> 01:32:35.840]   but wouldn't you wanna watch it if you could on a big screen?
[01:32:35.840 --> 01:32:38.720]   - Is this true, Om, that Mumbai has outlawed,
[01:32:38.720 --> 01:32:40.680]   I'm sorry, you prefer Bombay,
[01:32:40.680 --> 01:32:42.560]   has outlawed selfies?
[01:32:42.560 --> 01:32:46.040]   - I don't know.
[01:32:46.040 --> 01:32:47.800]   (laughs)
[01:32:47.800 --> 01:32:50.960]   That would be so hard to do.
[01:32:50.960 --> 01:32:52.240]   - So selfies.
[01:32:52.240 --> 01:32:57.200]   - I was in India a week ago visiting my parents
[01:32:57.200 --> 01:33:00.880]   and my people are obsessed with selfies.
[01:33:00.880 --> 01:33:04.520]   I mean, they do crazy things when it comes to selfies.
[01:33:04.520 --> 01:33:08.320]   And it's unbelievable how good they are at selfies.
[01:33:08.320 --> 01:33:12.280]   The problem is 19 people have died in India taking selfies.
[01:33:12.280 --> 01:33:16.840]   The total worldwide death toll of selfies is 49.
[01:33:16.840 --> 01:33:19.800]   And most of these deaths, by the way,
[01:33:19.800 --> 01:33:24.800]   are 21 year old men who are climbing on things.
[01:33:24.800 --> 01:33:29.280]   I think the state of New York has banned selfies with tigers.
[01:33:29.280 --> 01:33:30.600]   Not allowed.
[01:33:30.600 --> 01:33:32.120]   I'm not kidding.
[01:33:32.120 --> 01:33:34.080]   You think I'm joking.
[01:33:34.080 --> 01:33:37.200]   - But wouldn't taking any picture next to a tiger be dangerous?
[01:33:37.200 --> 01:33:38.040]   - Yes.
[01:33:38.040 --> 01:33:39.480]   - Because it really is a selfie or just don't take a photo.
[01:33:39.480 --> 01:33:42.440]   Don't get that close to a tiger is the real lesson.
[01:33:42.440 --> 01:33:45.200]   Don't climb on things and then let go of one hand.
[01:33:45.200 --> 01:33:46.840]   - It's interesting.
[01:33:46.840 --> 01:33:49.640]   I mean, you understand why I say, for instance,
[01:33:49.640 --> 01:33:52.280]   the city of Pempalona, Spain may ban selfies
[01:33:52.280 --> 01:33:53.920]   during the running of the bulls.
[01:33:53.920 --> 01:33:55.000]   (laughs)
[01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:56.920]   - Look at me, I'm out!
[01:33:56.920 --> 01:33:59.760]   But why the state of New York decided
[01:33:59.760 --> 01:34:04.760]   that they needed to make a law against tiger selfies?
[01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:11.120]   In New York, taking selfies with tigers is banned by state law.
[01:34:11.120 --> 01:34:14.240]   - You know what I did?
[01:34:14.240 --> 01:34:16.160]   - I did run the Pempalona bulls.
[01:34:16.160 --> 01:34:19.560]   - Did you wear a really red scarf?
[01:34:19.560 --> 01:34:20.400]   - Oh yeah.
[01:34:20.400 --> 01:34:21.240]   - What were you thinking?
[01:34:21.240 --> 01:34:22.960]   What a stupid, I'm sorry.
[01:34:22.960 --> 01:34:23.800]   - I love it.
[01:34:23.800 --> 01:34:24.640]   I think that's great.
[01:34:24.640 --> 01:34:25.960]   - What did you say, guys?
[01:34:25.960 --> 01:34:27.960]   - I was 22.
[01:34:27.960 --> 01:34:28.800]   - I was 22.
[01:34:28.800 --> 01:34:30.120]   - But that's the problem.
[01:34:30.120 --> 01:34:34.640]   That's who dies taking selfies is 21 year old men.
[01:34:34.640 --> 01:34:37.400]   This is another one, very popular.
[01:34:37.400 --> 01:34:39.040]   They take you selfies while you're walking
[01:34:39.040 --> 01:34:43.200]   on architectural masterpieces way high up in the air.
[01:34:43.200 --> 01:34:44.040]   What is this?
[01:34:44.040 --> 01:34:45.640]   - Oh, stupid!
[01:34:45.640 --> 01:34:47.640]   Don't do this.
[01:34:47.640 --> 01:34:48.480]   How about this one?
[01:34:48.480 --> 01:34:51.320]   There's a guy taking a photo with a tiger.
[01:34:51.320 --> 01:34:52.800]   And for some reason we don't know,
[01:34:52.800 --> 01:34:54.560]   he's doing the heavy metal.
[01:34:54.560 --> 01:34:56.040]   (imitates a heavy metal)
[01:34:56.040 --> 01:34:58.280]   (laughs)
[01:34:58.280 --> 01:35:01.480]   - Well, so would using a GoPro be any better though?
[01:35:01.480 --> 01:35:04.000]   - I think, I don't think it mentions the kind of camera.
[01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:05.600]   I don't think it says, you know.
[01:35:05.600 --> 01:35:06.980]   - I think in many ways,
[01:35:06.980 --> 01:35:09.960]   selfie deaths are proof that Darwin exists.
[01:35:09.960 --> 01:35:11.080]   - Yes, I agree.
[01:35:11.080 --> 01:35:12.920]   (laughs)
[01:35:12.920 --> 01:35:15.880]   - Survival of the least of the fittest.
[01:35:15.880 --> 01:35:18.000]   - I'm waiting for the accidents.
[01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.080]   People wearing VR things are gonna fall over
[01:35:20.080 --> 01:35:21.560]   and kill themselves in their houses.
[01:35:21.560 --> 01:35:22.960]   - That's true.
[01:35:22.960 --> 01:35:24.320]   I'm actually a little bit scared.
[01:35:24.320 --> 01:35:25.160]   - Your husband.
[01:35:25.160 --> 01:35:26.680]   (laughs)
[01:35:26.680 --> 01:35:28.560]   - Myself too, I'm very excited about it.
[01:35:28.560 --> 01:35:30.160]   But on our room we have like,
[01:35:30.160 --> 01:35:31.440]   there's stairs to where it is.
[01:35:31.440 --> 01:35:33.240]   So we're gonna have to pour it in off
[01:35:33.240 --> 01:35:35.720]   so that when we're playing a really scary game
[01:35:35.720 --> 01:35:37.320]   running away from a monster,
[01:35:37.320 --> 01:35:39.120]   even though on the HTC Vive,
[01:35:39.120 --> 01:35:40.840]   when you get close to a wall,
[01:35:40.840 --> 01:35:41.880]   it'll show you the wall,
[01:35:41.880 --> 01:35:44.320]   but I think that I may go into panic mode
[01:35:44.320 --> 01:35:47.680]   and just jump over to the stairs and hurt myself anyways.
[01:35:47.680 --> 01:35:49.440]   So that might happen.
[01:35:49.440 --> 01:35:51.800]   - I love our Oculus Rift.
[01:35:51.800 --> 01:35:55.720]   We actually didn't own a Windows machine powerful enough,
[01:35:55.720 --> 01:35:57.240]   so we had to build one,
[01:35:57.240 --> 01:36:00.240]   which we did on the new screensavers.
[01:36:00.240 --> 01:36:03.000]   We finished it yesterday.
[01:36:03.240 --> 01:36:04.800]   Actually finally added the monitoring stuff,
[01:36:04.800 --> 01:36:06.240]   but we got the Oculus Rift last week
[01:36:06.240 --> 01:36:07.760]   and I can't wait to get the Vive.
[01:36:07.760 --> 01:36:09.280]   I think you wear a right to buy the Vive
[01:36:09.280 --> 01:36:11.760]   'cause the Vive has the handles.
[01:36:11.760 --> 01:36:12.600]   - We have both.
[01:36:12.600 --> 01:36:15.040]   We're gonna be getting the Oculus Rift as well.
[01:36:15.040 --> 01:36:18.680]   It's for work.
[01:36:18.680 --> 01:36:21.440]   - Sure, sure.
[01:36:21.440 --> 01:36:22.280]   - Absolutely.
[01:36:22.280 --> 01:36:23.360]   - Yeah, sure.
[01:36:23.360 --> 01:36:28.160]   But what I love about the Vive is exactly,
[01:36:28.160 --> 01:36:30.240]   as you mentioned, Leo, is that you have your,
[01:36:30.240 --> 01:36:32.440]   one is it's gonna be able to see the outside of you
[01:36:32.440 --> 01:36:34.440]   and plus you're being able to use your hands
[01:36:34.440 --> 01:36:35.920]   instead of using a controller,
[01:36:35.920 --> 01:36:40.040]   plus walking around is gonna be so much cooler on the Vive.
[01:36:40.040 --> 01:36:41.800]   So I'm excited for both though.
[01:36:41.800 --> 01:36:43.000]   I'm okay with either.
[01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:44.360]   - And thanks to our chat room,
[01:36:44.360 --> 01:36:47.760]   here's a video of a girl taking a selfie
[01:36:47.760 --> 01:36:50.280]   getting hit on the head with a tuba.
[01:36:50.280 --> 01:36:55.280]   So, oh, don't please, don't stop it.
[01:36:55.280 --> 01:36:58.960]   Okay, back to VR.
[01:37:00.760 --> 01:37:02.840]   - It seems, though, must as if the tech industry
[01:37:02.840 --> 01:37:07.600]   is trying to find ways for us to creatively off ourselves.
[01:37:07.600 --> 01:37:10.720]   It is really fun.
[01:37:10.720 --> 01:37:13.640]   So I've played and it's funny because it's games
[01:37:13.640 --> 01:37:16.520]   that you would normally not play,
[01:37:16.520 --> 01:37:19.480]   like Lucky's Tale, which is a fox
[01:37:19.480 --> 01:37:21.680]   jumping around, it's a platformer kind of.
[01:37:21.680 --> 01:37:23.920]   But as soon as you're in this cartoon world
[01:37:23.920 --> 01:37:26.880]   and you can look around, it's pretty cool.
[01:37:26.880 --> 01:37:29.440]   It's pretty cool.
[01:37:29.440 --> 01:37:31.240]   - Do you have a video?
[01:37:31.240 --> 01:37:33.280]   - Of me playing the game?
[01:37:33.280 --> 01:37:34.480]   Oh, of course.
[01:37:34.480 --> 01:37:37.680]   You just wanna mock me.
[01:37:37.680 --> 01:37:39.720]   This is the game, it's called,
[01:37:39.720 --> 01:37:41.760]   but see, you see it in 2D, it's not as much fun,
[01:37:41.760 --> 01:37:44.720]   but when you're actually in there as Lucky.
[01:37:44.720 --> 01:37:47.080]   - You see you jumping around.
[01:37:47.080 --> 01:37:48.960]   - I don't know if they've shot video of that.
[01:37:48.960 --> 01:37:51.120]   I try to do it when nobody's around.
[01:37:51.120 --> 01:37:52.360]   - That's what we need.
[01:37:52.360 --> 01:37:54.920]   I want you to see playing alien isolation.
[01:37:54.920 --> 01:37:56.640]   Here's the keys you comes in late at night
[01:37:56.640 --> 01:37:57.480]   and doesn't work not here.
[01:37:57.480 --> 01:37:58.760]   - I do it late at night.
[01:37:58.760 --> 01:38:01.200]   - Hey, speaking of selfies, by the way,
[01:38:01.200 --> 01:38:02.840]   the monkey selfie,
[01:38:02.840 --> 01:38:06.880]   quartz ruled that, yeah, he's filing an appeal.
[01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:09.160]   - Is the monkey his?
[01:38:09.160 --> 01:38:10.000]   - Yes.
[01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:16.000]   The quartz ruled that a monkey can't actually own his own selfie.
[01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:21.520]   He is now appealing this in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals
[01:38:21.520 --> 01:38:24.800]   whilst it was brought by PETA on behalf of Naruto,
[01:38:24.800 --> 01:38:28.360]   who was a crested Sulawesi Mac, Macaque,
[01:38:28.360 --> 01:38:30.720]   against the nature photographer David Slater.
[01:38:30.720 --> 01:38:34.880]   See Slater published the picture in a book
[01:38:34.880 --> 01:38:38.840]   saying that Naruto took the picture of himself,
[01:38:38.840 --> 01:38:42.640]   which is obvious if you look at his cheapest expression.
[01:38:42.640 --> 01:38:44.720]   - Of course it's obvious.
[01:38:44.720 --> 01:38:45.840]   - I'm a Macaque.
[01:38:45.840 --> 01:38:51.200]   - Lower court, so lawyers claim the monkey owns the copyright
[01:38:51.200 --> 01:38:54.200]   and that the photographer Slater and the publishing company
[01:38:54.200 --> 01:38:57.520]   have infringed on it, the lower court dismissed the suit
[01:38:57.520 --> 01:38:59.840]   saying animals don't have the standing to sue
[01:38:59.840 --> 01:39:01.360]   under the Copyright Act.
[01:39:01.360 --> 01:39:05.600]   Apparently based on a Ninth Circuit case
[01:39:05.600 --> 01:39:09.800]   called that is named Sitation versus Bush,
[01:39:09.800 --> 01:39:14.240]   a self-appointed attorney for all the world's whales,
[01:39:14.240 --> 01:39:16.040]   porpoises, and dolphin sued the Navy
[01:39:16.040 --> 01:39:19.120]   for using a sonar system harmful to marine mammals.
[01:39:19.120 --> 01:39:20.240]   That was thrown out.
[01:39:20.240 --> 01:39:24.800]   So now the Supreme, now the appeals court is gonna
[01:39:24.800 --> 01:39:29.800]   hear the appeal by the Macaque, says, "No, I own this."
[01:39:29.800 --> 01:39:34.120]   And I don't know what he's gonna do with the royalties.
[01:39:34.120 --> 01:39:34.960]   - If he can't, he's a can.
[01:39:34.960 --> 01:39:37.000]   - I'm so glad that technology has come this far.
[01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.160]   - I'm thinking by the banana farm.
[01:39:39.160 --> 01:39:42.320]   - The technology has brought this advancement,
[01:39:42.320 --> 01:39:45.880]   this disruption for the laws is just amazing.
[01:39:45.880 --> 01:39:48.320]   I mean, how far can technology go?
[01:39:48.320 --> 01:39:50.680]   - Do you think judges must go, "Oh my God,
[01:39:50.680 --> 01:39:51.960]   how do I get a better job?
[01:39:51.960 --> 01:39:53.880]   How do I get out of here?"
[01:39:53.880 --> 01:39:56.120]   - So my question is, if he can't give you the rights
[01:39:56.120 --> 01:39:57.960]   to the selfie, then how can he sue?
[01:39:57.960 --> 01:40:00.360]   It seems like if he can sue, then maybe they got
[01:40:00.360 --> 01:40:03.800]   a little paw print from the monkey to say, "Listen,"
[01:40:03.800 --> 01:40:04.960]   he said, "It's okay."
[01:40:04.960 --> 01:40:08.440]   - I'd be pissed if I were the photographer.
[01:40:08.440 --> 01:40:10.200]   I mean, if the photographer is not there
[01:40:10.200 --> 01:40:12.400]   and sets up the camera, I mean, I don't know what happened.
[01:40:12.400 --> 01:40:13.640]   Would the monkey steal his camera?
[01:40:13.640 --> 01:40:15.440]   Is that how he got the selfie?
[01:40:15.440 --> 01:40:18.160]   - Yeah, the story is that the monkey took the camera and--
[01:40:18.160 --> 01:40:19.240]   - And then what?
[01:40:19.240 --> 01:40:20.320]   - Yeah, it was looking at it.
[01:40:20.320 --> 01:40:23.400]   - And David got a great picture, right?
[01:40:23.400 --> 01:40:25.320]   It's in focus and everything.
[01:40:25.320 --> 01:40:27.320]   - This weekend law covered it extensively.
[01:40:27.320 --> 01:40:28.160]   - No, really?
[01:40:28.160 --> 01:40:29.840]   - Yeah, not recently.
[01:40:29.840 --> 01:40:32.240]   - Oh yeah, because it's all yours now, yeah.
[01:40:32.240 --> 01:40:34.680]   Well, it's back.
[01:40:34.680 --> 01:40:36.680]   He's a monkey's appealing.
[01:40:36.680 --> 01:40:41.560]   Actually, this ties into your New Yorker article,
[01:40:41.560 --> 01:40:43.360]   doesn't it, oh?
[01:40:43.360 --> 01:40:44.200]   - It does.
[01:40:44.200 --> 01:40:45.120]   - Tell us about that.
[01:40:45.120 --> 01:40:50.120]   So the title of the article was,
[01:40:50.320 --> 01:40:54.600]   photograph everything, see nothing.
[01:40:54.600 --> 01:40:57.880]   - So the article came about when I read the news
[01:40:57.880 --> 01:41:00.960]   that Nick's software was going free.
[01:41:00.960 --> 01:41:03.560]   And the first thought that went through my mind was,
[01:41:03.560 --> 01:41:06.440]   oh well, they don't wanna publicly announce
[01:41:06.440 --> 01:41:10.440]   they're killing it, but this is what it is pointing to.
[01:41:10.440 --> 01:41:11.960]   They're gonna kill this.
[01:41:11.960 --> 01:41:14.480]   And they mean Google.
[01:41:14.480 --> 01:41:17.760]   But when I thought about it, it made perfect sense
[01:41:17.760 --> 01:41:19.600]   that they're doing this,
[01:41:19.600 --> 01:41:24.600]   because we take so many photos now as average human beings
[01:41:24.600 --> 01:41:31.160]   that we don't have enough time to edit these pictures
[01:41:31.160 --> 01:41:33.520]   the way we used to edit them.
[01:41:33.520 --> 01:41:38.280]   First, we used to develop the pictures inside dark rooms.
[01:41:38.280 --> 01:41:40.840]   Then we went to the desktop software,
[01:41:40.840 --> 01:41:44.480]   like Photoshop and Lightroom and Nick software.
[01:41:44.480 --> 01:41:47.480]   And now we just keep taking photos.
[01:41:47.480 --> 01:41:52.480]   And the whole, the idea of photography has left
[01:41:52.480 --> 01:41:56.840]   the realm of human scale,
[01:41:56.840 --> 01:41:59.520]   and it's gotten to a scale where only way
[01:41:59.520 --> 01:42:01.480]   to make sense of our libraries,
[01:42:01.480 --> 01:42:03.640]   make, edit all these pictures,
[01:42:03.640 --> 01:42:07.680]   find the best ones, find the most magical moments.
[01:42:07.680 --> 01:42:12.480]   We need to end up using artificial intelligence machines.
[01:42:12.480 --> 01:42:15.120]   And from that standpoint,
[01:42:15.120 --> 01:42:18.280]   we don't really, we'll look at everything.
[01:42:18.280 --> 01:42:22.520]   We will just have all the photos edited
[01:42:22.520 --> 01:42:26.680]   and surfaced for us automatically by hardware.
[01:42:26.680 --> 01:42:27.520]   And if you look at--
[01:42:27.520 --> 01:42:28.600]   - That's what Google's doing, isn't it?
[01:42:28.600 --> 01:42:30.320]   I mean, that's kind of the idea.
[01:42:30.320 --> 01:42:32.920]   - And they, I would not be surprised
[01:42:32.920 --> 01:42:37.280]   that all the things which are great about Nick's software
[01:42:37.280 --> 01:42:38.880]   end up in Google Photos.
[01:42:38.880 --> 01:42:39.880]   - Right, right.
[01:42:39.880 --> 01:42:41.920]   - And I think this is a logical progression.
[01:42:41.920 --> 01:42:44.560]   And that's what I argue in my piece
[01:42:44.560 --> 01:42:48.240]   that you should not get upset about the shift,
[01:42:48.240 --> 01:42:52.640]   but it is the logical progression for photography.
[01:42:52.640 --> 01:42:54.880]   We are no longer making photos
[01:42:54.880 --> 01:42:57.720]   from an aesthetic artistic standpoint.
[01:42:57.720 --> 01:43:00.800]   And now we are making photos as essentially
[01:43:00.800 --> 01:43:04.240]   part of our everyday language and everyday memory.
[01:43:04.240 --> 01:43:06.840]   - I see, I mean, this is the image that you used
[01:43:06.840 --> 01:43:09.360]   in the article of people at a concert
[01:43:09.360 --> 01:43:11.880]   and everybody's got the phone and taking pictures.
[01:43:11.880 --> 01:43:13.280]   I see this kind of stuff and I wonder
[01:43:13.280 --> 01:43:15.320]   when are they gonna ever look at that?
[01:43:15.320 --> 01:43:17.280]   They are not enjoying the concert.
[01:43:17.280 --> 01:43:19.160]   They are busy taking a picture.
[01:43:19.160 --> 01:43:22.120]   And I can almost promise you that once they Instagram
[01:43:22.120 --> 01:43:24.520]   one shot to show their unlucky friends
[01:43:24.520 --> 01:43:26.400]   how lucky they are to be at this show,
[01:43:26.400 --> 01:43:28.520]   they will never look at any of those images,
[01:43:28.520 --> 01:43:31.240]   especially the video again.
[01:43:31.240 --> 01:43:32.600]   - But if you look at--
[01:43:32.600 --> 01:43:35.680]   - If you take a step back and you're looking at this
[01:43:35.680 --> 01:43:38.480]   and saying, well, I was at this concert.
[01:43:38.480 --> 01:43:42.800]   That's essentially this photo is like a text saying--
[01:43:42.800 --> 01:43:44.840]   - Photos or it didn't happen, yeah.
[01:43:44.840 --> 01:43:50.920]   - And so it's like photos are very much like bookmarks of life.
[01:43:50.920 --> 01:43:55.680]   - I think that you're right about it's being something
[01:43:55.680 --> 01:43:57.920]   that you can look back on and remember it.
[01:43:57.920 --> 01:44:00.240]   But I think that we also end up,
[01:44:00.240 --> 01:44:03.880]   we spend so much time wanting to plaster our moments
[01:44:03.880 --> 01:44:07.920]   around social networks that we're not really in these moments.
[01:44:07.920 --> 01:44:10.400]   Ourselves were not really enjoying the concert
[01:44:10.400 --> 01:44:12.240]   and how it feels because we're so busy
[01:44:12.240 --> 01:44:13.920]   trying to take that perfect picture
[01:44:13.920 --> 01:44:15.320]   that's gonna make our friends jealous
[01:44:15.320 --> 01:44:18.520]   or that we're gonna be able to show to grandma.
[01:44:18.520 --> 01:44:21.240]   That I always worry about us being in the immediacy
[01:44:21.240 --> 01:44:22.720]   of being Zen and in the moment,
[01:44:22.720 --> 01:44:25.160]   everyone's trying to get ahead, getting a better shot.
[01:44:25.160 --> 01:44:28.040]   And so you wanna, sometimes I'm like,
[01:44:28.040 --> 01:44:31.120]   you know, put the phone down and just like be there.
[01:44:31.120 --> 01:44:32.960]   - I think that's one aspect of it.
[01:44:32.960 --> 01:44:36.240]   I think if you sometimes you see something in a store,
[01:44:36.240 --> 01:44:37.400]   you take a picture of that,
[01:44:37.400 --> 01:44:40.920]   you see something on the wall written in a magazine,
[01:44:40.920 --> 01:44:42.000]   you just take a picture of that.
[01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:46.360]   - So this is, you know, I think the behavior around photography
[01:44:46.360 --> 01:44:47.240]   is changing.
[01:44:47.240 --> 01:44:50.440]   I don't think it's about making photographs.
[01:44:50.440 --> 01:44:55.440]   It's about, you know, capturing visual data from a sensor.
[01:44:55.440 --> 01:44:59.840]   - What do you, how do you feel about this life logging thing?
[01:44:59.840 --> 01:45:02.200]   Gordon Bell very famously was doing it.
[01:45:02.200 --> 01:45:05.360]   In fact, wrote a book on it.
[01:45:05.360 --> 01:45:07.000]   There's a company, I bought this one,
[01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:11.280]   another great Kickstarter investment called Narrative
[01:45:11.280 --> 01:45:13.400]   that you wear this clip on camera
[01:45:13.400 --> 01:45:15.720]   and every 30 seconds it just takes pictures
[01:45:15.720 --> 01:45:17.040]   and uploads them to a server.
[01:45:17.040 --> 01:45:19.800]   So you basically have pictures.
[01:45:19.800 --> 01:45:22.320]   The reason I stopped wearing it is the pictures
[01:45:22.320 --> 01:45:23.800]   were always like of somebody's navel
[01:45:23.800 --> 01:45:26.280]   'cause it's on, you know, it's on your,
[01:45:26.280 --> 01:45:27.920]   it's not good pictures,
[01:45:27.920 --> 01:45:30.880]   but your whole life is recorded in pictures.
[01:45:30.880 --> 01:45:34.400]   Mike Elgin who also wears one of these dope eat narrative
[01:45:34.400 --> 01:45:36.400]   clips wrote an article or an opinion piece
[01:45:36.400 --> 01:45:38.120]   in the computer world this week.
[01:45:38.120 --> 01:45:40.000]   Life logging is dead for now.
[01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:43.000]   He was talking to Gordon Bell who kind of invented this,
[01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:44.400]   even wrote a book on it.
[01:45:44.400 --> 01:45:50.760]   He said it was Gordon called it his My Life Bits project.
[01:45:50.760 --> 01:45:52.520]   Gordon was one of the chief scientists
[01:45:52.520 --> 01:45:53.520]   at the digital equipment.
[01:45:53.520 --> 01:45:56.480]   He was at Microsoft when he created this.
[01:45:56.480 --> 01:45:58.320]   He said, "Now I don't do it anymore."
[01:45:58.320 --> 01:46:04.160]   It's not something that's bringing a lot of value to my life.
[01:46:04.160 --> 01:46:07.400]   He says, "We're overloaded with data."
[01:46:07.400 --> 01:46:12.400]   And the public is suffering from data fatigue.
[01:46:12.400 --> 01:46:17.400]   We don't need anymore pictures of our life.
[01:46:17.400 --> 01:46:18.840]   We don't want them.
[01:46:18.840 --> 01:46:22.600]   And by the way, if we needed them,
[01:46:22.600 --> 01:46:24.760]   we've got the camera phone to take them.
[01:46:24.760 --> 01:46:26.800]   I think--
[01:46:26.800 --> 01:46:27.800]   - Yeah, yeah, most of my life would be,
[01:46:27.800 --> 01:46:29.960]   it would be of me sitting on the couch.
[01:46:29.960 --> 01:46:30.960]   - Well, you know, Gordon was--
[01:46:30.960 --> 01:46:31.760]   - Why are you depressing?
[01:46:31.760 --> 01:46:34.000]   - Gordon was also influenced by his wife, Gwen,
[01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:35.080]   who was a wonderful person.
[01:46:35.080 --> 01:46:37.280]   She founded the Computer History Museum in San Jose
[01:46:37.280 --> 01:46:40.760]   and suffered towards the end from Alzheimer's.
[01:46:40.760 --> 01:46:42.120]   Couldn't remember anything.
[01:46:42.120 --> 01:46:44.080]   And one of the things that I think really interested Gordon
[01:46:44.080 --> 01:46:47.120]   was this idea of, well, if you won't be able to remember it,
[01:46:47.120 --> 01:46:50.760]   but your camera will and you can go back through your life,
[01:46:50.760 --> 01:46:53.080]   whether it's just yesterday and see what you did
[01:46:53.080 --> 01:46:56.120]   or 10 years ago or 100, 50 years ago
[01:46:56.120 --> 01:46:58.720]   and see your life that way.
[01:46:58.720 --> 01:47:02.080]   And he thought that that would be kind of interesting.
[01:47:02.080 --> 01:47:05.880]   - Might be great if you're life,
[01:47:05.880 --> 01:47:08.760]   if you are interesting or you had an interesting life.
[01:47:08.760 --> 01:47:11.800]   - Nobody is, nobody even the most interesting person
[01:47:11.800 --> 01:47:13.720]   it turns out their life is pretty dull.
[01:47:13.720 --> 01:47:14.560]   - Yes.
[01:47:14.560 --> 01:47:15.960]   I mean, I spent a couple of years
[01:47:15.960 --> 01:47:19.800]   about traveling through Africa in the Middle East
[01:47:19.800 --> 01:47:22.560]   and I took in the days of film,
[01:47:22.560 --> 01:47:27.040]   a 35 millimeter camera and took photos occasionally
[01:47:27.040 --> 01:47:30.280]   when most of the time I didn't get it out
[01:47:30.280 --> 01:47:32.760]   because the camera was actually quite valuable
[01:47:32.760 --> 01:47:34.080]   and people would wanna steal it
[01:47:34.080 --> 01:47:36.360]   when you're traveling through the world countries
[01:47:36.360 --> 01:47:38.120]   getting a camera out is pretty difficult.
[01:47:38.120 --> 01:47:40.080]   But I've got enough photos, they're all weird,
[01:47:40.080 --> 01:47:42.160]   they're all badly framed, they're not exposed.
[01:47:42.160 --> 01:47:44.000]   At some point I dropped the camera
[01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.120]   and the left hand side went out of focus,
[01:47:46.120 --> 01:47:49.000]   but I have the photos there to give me memories.
[01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.200]   And today what I do with photos,
[01:47:51.200 --> 01:47:53.240]   which I think is to OAM's point,
[01:47:53.240 --> 01:47:54.960]   he makes a good point about what we're doing
[01:47:54.960 --> 01:47:57.520]   is the relationship with photography is changing
[01:47:57.520 --> 01:48:01.960]   from rigid photos to something that's just a stream.
[01:48:02.960 --> 01:48:04.920]   I record a photo in my day one,
[01:48:04.920 --> 01:48:08.280]   I have a daily logger app on my iPhone.
[01:48:08.280 --> 01:48:10.360]   And recently I was in Las Vegas
[01:48:10.360 --> 01:48:12.600]   to do a podcast recording session
[01:48:12.600 --> 01:48:14.600]   and I just got the phone out, took some photos
[01:48:14.600 --> 01:48:16.640]   of the hotel room, photos of the hotel,
[01:48:16.640 --> 01:48:19.240]   of the recording sessions, of the people I was with
[01:48:19.240 --> 01:48:21.440]   and they automatically get caught into a diary app
[01:48:21.440 --> 01:48:22.360]   and they're there.
[01:48:22.360 --> 01:48:24.480]   And every now and then as I'm scrolling through the diary app,
[01:48:24.480 --> 01:48:25.400]   I see them again.
[01:48:25.400 --> 01:48:27.000]   Instead of writing an article,
[01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.640]   like 300 words on what happened today
[01:48:29.640 --> 01:48:31.520]   and what I'm thinking, I just took a photo
[01:48:31.520 --> 01:48:32.840]   and any time I need to see it,
[01:48:32.840 --> 01:48:36.400]   I can go back to that day, click on it
[01:48:36.400 --> 01:48:38.960]   and there's my geo tag, there's the photo
[01:48:38.960 --> 01:48:40.560]   and I can remember what I was doing that day
[01:48:40.560 --> 01:48:42.360]   and the memories are still there for me.
[01:48:42.360 --> 01:48:45.280]   And that's all I'm, that's the only thing I take photos of.
[01:48:45.280 --> 01:48:47.560]   I'm not a photographer, I don't expect to be,
[01:48:47.560 --> 01:48:48.920]   I'm a worst photographer ever
[01:48:48.920 --> 01:48:50.920]   and I'll never own a camera again,
[01:48:50.920 --> 01:48:52.440]   it'll just be my smartphone.
[01:48:52.440 --> 01:48:56.200]   - It feels like we're maybe a little more self-obsessed
[01:48:56.200 --> 01:48:57.520]   than we really ought to be.
[01:48:57.520 --> 01:48:59.800]   I don't know.
[01:48:59.800 --> 01:49:02.520]   - I think that you're probably right,
[01:49:02.520 --> 01:49:06.160]   we're getting worse for becoming a little bit more
[01:49:06.160 --> 01:49:09.480]   need for immediacy, fame and narcissism.
[01:49:09.480 --> 01:49:12.600]   But I think that as Almond and Greg were mentioning,
[01:49:12.600 --> 01:49:15.000]   it isn't, if you're gonna use it just to catalog
[01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:18.560]   and to use that as your way of writing your story
[01:49:18.560 --> 01:49:21.360]   to be able to remember, to be able to log something,
[01:49:21.360 --> 01:49:22.920]   then I think that that's nice.
[01:49:22.920 --> 01:49:25.360]   I think that social media has pushed that
[01:49:25.360 --> 01:49:26.680]   that everyone has to have
[01:49:26.680 --> 01:49:29.040]   and it makes other people feel like they're lacking.
[01:49:29.040 --> 01:49:31.600]   I have a lot of people come into my session saying,
[01:49:31.600 --> 01:49:33.720]   you know what, I'm looking at everyone else's life
[01:49:33.720 --> 01:49:36.040]   on Facebook, which leads to a lot of depression
[01:49:36.040 --> 01:49:38.800]   because you put onto Facebook on social media
[01:49:38.800 --> 01:49:41.840]   these great moments and so everyone thinks
[01:49:41.840 --> 01:49:43.600]   that everyone else is doing so much
[01:49:43.600 --> 01:49:45.360]   and then they reflect upon themselves and say,
[01:49:45.360 --> 01:49:46.680]   you know what, I'm doing so little
[01:49:46.680 --> 01:49:49.000]   and look at this person, they're climbing this mountain,
[01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:50.600]   this person's shark diving,
[01:49:50.600 --> 01:49:54.400]   someone else is Greg's running with the bulls
[01:49:54.400 --> 01:49:56.680]   and here I am at home on the couch,
[01:49:56.680 --> 01:49:57.920]   I'm watching Game of Thrones
[01:49:57.920 --> 01:50:01.160]   and how I wish that I could be doing these things as well.
[01:50:01.160 --> 01:50:03.640]   And so we need to kind of also put things into perspective
[01:50:03.640 --> 01:50:06.040]   that most people's lives are not like this
[01:50:06.040 --> 01:50:06.880]   and some of them are about to talk.
[01:50:06.880 --> 01:50:07.800]   - I wish I could be sitting on the couch
[01:50:07.800 --> 01:50:09.400]   watching Game of Thrones with you actually,
[01:50:09.400 --> 01:50:10.720]   that's what I got.
[01:50:10.720 --> 01:50:11.560]   - A lot of fun.
[01:50:11.560 --> 01:50:13.240]   - No, I do that though, I look at Instagram
[01:50:13.240 --> 01:50:14.720]   and sometimes it's depressing
[01:50:14.720 --> 01:50:16.800]   'cause everybody seems to be having more fun than I am.
[01:50:16.800 --> 01:50:19.000]   - People aren't gonna post pictures of themselves,
[01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:20.160]   going shopping.
[01:50:20.160 --> 01:50:22.160]   - Okay, let's make a pact.
[01:50:22.160 --> 01:50:24.400]   Georgia, you and I will post pictures of ourselves
[01:50:24.400 --> 01:50:26.000]   sitting on the couch.
[01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:26.840]   - I'll do it tonight.
[01:50:26.840 --> 01:50:28.080]   - From now on.
[01:50:28.080 --> 01:50:28.920]   - Leo, I've got a great--
[01:50:28.920 --> 01:50:29.800]   - I'll do it tonight.
[01:50:29.800 --> 01:50:30.960]   - There's a great app for you.
[01:50:30.960 --> 01:50:32.560]   If you wanna get into it, Leo,
[01:50:32.560 --> 01:50:34.800]   it's called "One Second Every Day."
[01:50:34.800 --> 01:50:36.720]   And what it does is it goes through your camera roll
[01:50:36.720 --> 01:50:40.000]   and it picks "One Second of Footage" from every day
[01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:41.000]   and it creates a timeline--
[01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:41.840]   - But randomly.
[01:50:41.840 --> 01:50:42.680]   - Randomly.
[01:50:42.680 --> 01:50:43.520]   - That could be dangerous.
[01:50:43.520 --> 01:50:45.000]   - No, but did you, yeah, no kidding.
[01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:45.840]   I take pictures I don't--
[01:50:45.840 --> 01:50:48.240]   - Just suppose to myself, I don't want to see again.
[01:50:48.240 --> 01:50:50.200]   - There's reasons I didn't post that on Instagram.
[01:50:50.200 --> 01:50:51.040]   - You can edit 'em that.
[01:50:51.040 --> 01:50:51.880]   You can edit which one--
[01:50:51.880 --> 01:50:52.840]   - All right, here's another one.
[01:50:52.840 --> 01:50:55.640]   This is one that Mike Algon wrote about in Computer World.
[01:50:55.640 --> 01:50:58.560]   Gordon Bell's on the advisory board of this digi.me,
[01:50:58.560 --> 01:51:03.160]   this goes out, it's a free app,
[01:51:03.160 --> 01:51:06.360]   but their premium versions will get more of your data
[01:51:06.360 --> 01:51:10.200]   and will get everything you post, everything you do.
[01:51:10.200 --> 01:51:13.320]   The internet of me, okay, solipsistic.
[01:51:13.320 --> 01:51:19.200]   And you download the app and it gathers everything
[01:51:19.200 --> 01:51:22.240]   so you have the internet of you.
[01:51:22.240 --> 01:51:26.440]   Okay, George and I,
[01:51:26.440 --> 01:51:29.320]   we're gonna make people feel better about themselves.
[01:51:29.320 --> 01:51:33.120]   No makeup, my hair will be in curlers,
[01:51:33.120 --> 01:51:35.440]   I will be sitting on the couch
[01:51:35.440 --> 01:51:39.360]   in my underwear watching reruns.
[01:51:39.360 --> 01:51:40.800]   - Okay, you've said it, you've said it.
[01:51:40.800 --> 01:51:41.640]   - Every day.
[01:51:41.640 --> 01:51:43.360]   - I don't know about every day.
[01:51:43.360 --> 01:51:45.600]   I'll do one today, I'll do one today.
[01:51:45.600 --> 01:51:47.600]   - You first. - I beg you on it.
[01:51:47.600 --> 01:51:48.800]   - You first.
[01:51:48.800 --> 01:51:50.520]   - I'll be a nice thing.
[01:51:50.520 --> 01:51:52.400]   - I'll be in my snodges.
[01:51:52.400 --> 01:51:55.240]   - To make it fair, just pick a moment in time,
[01:51:55.240 --> 01:51:56.800]   642 PM.
[01:51:56.800 --> 01:51:57.680]   - No, no, no, no, no.
[01:51:57.680 --> 01:51:59.760]   - Eh, and whatever you're doing, it's 642 PM.
[01:51:59.760 --> 01:52:02.040]   - No, that's too dangerous, I don't think that's a good idea.
[01:52:02.040 --> 01:52:03.600]   (laughing)
[01:52:03.600 --> 01:52:05.000]   And then by the way, we'll know,
[01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:08.480]   and then we'll like, so I'll arrange to be skydiving
[01:52:08.480 --> 01:52:11.440]   at 642, and something like that.
[01:52:11.440 --> 01:52:13.680]   - Just to make me feel bad when I'm on my couch.
[01:52:13.680 --> 01:52:14.680]   - Yeah. - Rollers.
[01:52:14.680 --> 01:52:15.520]   - Yeah, I know.
[01:52:15.520 --> 01:52:17.520]   - Well, and she's got 24 hours to step up her game.
[01:52:17.520 --> 01:52:19.320]   - You have to take a picture of yourself
[01:52:19.320 --> 01:52:22.480]   at the least desirable moment.
[01:52:22.480 --> 01:52:24.240]   Like the people, you want the picture
[01:52:24.240 --> 01:52:27.120]   to make people feel good about themselves.
[01:52:27.120 --> 01:52:28.560]   - Yes, okay. - A selfie,
[01:52:28.560 --> 01:52:31.440]   designed to make other people feel good.
[01:52:31.440 --> 01:52:35.080]   Like you've got your face buried in Ben and Jerry's,
[01:52:35.080 --> 01:52:40.080]   and your hair's sticking up, right?
[01:52:40.080 --> 01:52:42.440]   - A selfie to make sure that I lose
[01:52:42.440 --> 01:52:44.320]   as many Twitter followers as possible.
[01:52:44.320 --> 01:52:45.400]   - Nobody's gonna do that. - I understand.
[01:52:45.400 --> 01:52:46.680]   - Exactly, nobody's gonna do that,
[01:52:46.680 --> 01:52:48.840]   'cause they're afraid of losing followers, exactly.
[01:52:48.840 --> 01:52:50.440]   - I'm good for that, I'll do it, don't worry,
[01:52:50.440 --> 01:52:51.360]   I don't have that many.
[01:52:51.360 --> 01:52:52.720]   (laughing)
[01:52:52.720 --> 01:52:53.680]   - All right, let's take a break,
[01:52:53.680 --> 01:52:55.480]   we're gonna come back with more old Malekas here
[01:52:55.480 --> 01:52:57.800]   at Georgia Dow from I Am More, it's great to have you.
[01:52:57.800 --> 01:53:00.200]   And of course, our newest Anubie,
[01:53:00.200 --> 01:53:02.840]   who is fitting in quite well, Greg.
[01:53:02.840 --> 01:53:06.440]   Greg Farrow from Packet Pushers.
[01:53:06.440 --> 01:53:08.480]   Tell us a little bit about Packet Pushers,
[01:53:08.480 --> 01:53:10.240]   PacketPushers.net.
[01:53:10.240 --> 01:53:13.160]   - Oh, well Packet Pushers is a deeply nerdy show
[01:53:13.160 --> 01:53:15.960]   on data networking, that is building
[01:53:15.960 --> 01:53:20.680]   into networks of computers globally and for enterprise IT.
[01:53:20.680 --> 01:53:22.320]   We've been doing it for about five years,
[01:53:22.320 --> 01:53:26.880]   we've done over 450 shows and it's now my full time business.
[01:53:26.880 --> 01:53:28.160]   We have a hell of a lot of fun
[01:53:28.160 --> 01:53:30.840]   producing different sorts of content.
[01:53:30.840 --> 01:53:33.560]   We work with a lot of the biggest enterprise IT companies
[01:53:33.560 --> 01:53:36.600]   as well as the startup market to bring their message
[01:53:36.600 --> 01:53:38.080]   to the audience, but what we try and do
[01:53:38.080 --> 01:53:40.800]   is focus on the technology, not the product.
[01:53:40.800 --> 01:53:42.960]   - Nice, fun.
[01:53:42.960 --> 01:53:44.480]   - That's a lot. - Real pleasure meeting you,
[01:53:44.480 --> 01:53:47.160]   thank you for being a part of the show today.
[01:53:47.160 --> 01:53:48.760]   - I'm looking forward to coming and meeting
[01:53:48.760 --> 01:53:49.840]   your next time I'm in the valley.
[01:53:49.840 --> 01:53:51.680]   - And I think you'll be back.
[01:53:51.680 --> 01:53:53.720]   Our show today brought to you by Go To Meeting,
[01:53:53.720 --> 01:53:57.440]   be a meeting MVP.
[01:53:57.440 --> 01:54:00.400]   No matter where you are, you can get your work done,
[01:54:00.400 --> 01:54:02.920]   you can have those meetings you have to have for business,
[01:54:02.920 --> 01:54:06.480]   you could even, I don't know, be watching the NBA.
[01:54:06.480 --> 01:54:08.240]   A lot of people around here very interested
[01:54:08.240 --> 01:54:10.680]   in the Golden State Warriors right now,
[01:54:10.680 --> 01:54:12.160]   why bother going to work?
[01:54:12.160 --> 01:54:13.960]   You can hold that meeting in a bar.
[01:54:13.960 --> 01:54:16.080]   With Go To Meeting you start a meeting with one click,
[01:54:16.080 --> 01:54:18.480]   it makes it easy to meet with your team anywhere,
[01:54:18.480 --> 01:54:21.520]   anytime, even from a mobile device,
[01:54:21.520 --> 01:54:23.400]   even from your iPad, you can actually present
[01:54:23.400 --> 01:54:24.800]   from your iPad.
[01:54:24.800 --> 01:54:26.440]   Use your webcam to see your colleagues
[01:54:26.440 --> 01:54:30.160]   in high def video, really is as good as being there.
[01:54:30.160 --> 01:54:32.840]   Share your screen so that you're on the same page,
[01:54:32.840 --> 01:54:34.760]   great for collaborating on documents,
[01:54:34.760 --> 01:54:36.320]   making a presentation.
[01:54:36.320 --> 01:54:39.920]   I love it for, you know, sales presentations are great
[01:54:39.920 --> 01:54:42.760]   because it's easy for you, it's easy for your client.
[01:54:42.760 --> 01:54:44.680]   And you know, to be honest, I think a lot of people
[01:54:44.680 --> 01:54:46.520]   think, oh, I gotta fly out, take the client
[01:54:46.520 --> 01:54:48.400]   to lunch, blah, blah, blah, that's really old school
[01:54:48.400 --> 01:54:49.880]   and your client doesn't want that.
[01:54:49.880 --> 01:54:51.200]   client wants to get in and get out,
[01:54:51.200 --> 01:54:54.440]   just show me what you got and this makes it easy.
[01:54:54.440 --> 01:54:56.440]   If you wanna do presentations together,
[01:54:56.440 --> 01:54:59.240]   you could pass off presenter duties easily
[01:54:59.240 --> 01:55:00.760]   and you can even, if you wanna be, you know,
[01:55:00.760 --> 01:55:02.920]   the wise acre in the back of the class,
[01:55:02.920 --> 01:55:04.680]   you could send private chats and video links
[01:55:04.680 --> 01:55:06.360]   during the presentations.
[01:55:06.360 --> 01:55:08.840]   Go to meeting, it really steps up your meeting game,
[01:55:08.840 --> 01:55:11.840]   it is a must have, be a meeting MVP.

[01:55:30.280 --> 01:55:34.160]   - I'm just gonna jump in there, Leo,
[01:55:34.160 --> 01:55:36.720]   go to meeting is my favorite platform for that.
[01:55:36.720 --> 01:55:39.240]   I've been using it now for five years
[01:55:39.240 --> 01:55:41.480]   and can highly recommend go to meeting to people.
[01:55:41.480 --> 01:55:44.120]   I've tried all the other platforms that are out there
[01:55:44.120 --> 01:55:46.080]   and go to meeting still remains my favorite.
[01:55:46.080 --> 01:55:48.440]   - You know, we're not paying you extra for saying that.
[01:55:48.440 --> 01:55:51.080]   - I know you're not, but I really wanna see if the other one's
[01:55:51.080 --> 01:55:54.320]   no way, 'cause I keep having to use them and I love them.
[01:55:54.320 --> 01:55:58.080]   - I really hate that actually when somebody says,
[01:55:58.080 --> 01:56:02.640]   oh, we're gonna use product X and I go, oh, please no.
[01:56:02.640 --> 01:56:03.960]   - I've gotta use this and I'm going like,
[01:56:03.960 --> 01:56:06.600]   oh, and once we're still plugging and then it wants to.
[01:56:06.600 --> 01:56:10.920]   - So who's gonna buy Yahoo?
[01:56:10.920 --> 01:56:15.480]   Yahoo has decided to let the clock tick a little bit longer.
[01:56:15.480 --> 01:56:16.760]   They are for sale.
[01:56:16.760 --> 01:56:17.920]   There's a deal book out.
[01:56:17.920 --> 01:56:19.440]   People have seen it.
[01:56:19.440 --> 01:56:20.800]   It's circulating around.
[01:56:20.800 --> 01:56:25.800]   They've decided to take bids through April 18th now
[01:56:25.800 --> 01:56:31.080]   and lots of rumors about who might buy them.
[01:56:31.080 --> 01:56:34.280]   I think the inside track goes to Verizon,
[01:56:34.280 --> 01:56:36.660]   which of course bought AOL recently.
[01:56:36.660 --> 01:56:42.720]   Softbank, perhaps the big Japanese investment arm.
[01:56:42.720 --> 01:56:45.400]   Some have said Google's interested according to Kerris,
[01:56:45.400 --> 01:56:47.680]   who probably knows all.
[01:56:47.680 --> 01:56:50.680]   She says, the truth is the mergers and acquisition unit
[01:56:50.680 --> 01:56:52.720]   that Google crunched the numbers as they should,
[01:56:52.720 --> 01:56:54.840]   but an offer is highly unlikely.
[01:56:54.840 --> 01:56:58.120]   She says AT&T, lukewarm.
[01:56:58.120 --> 01:57:02.920]   And now this just in,
[01:57:02.920 --> 01:57:05.720]   it would be pretty funny,
[01:57:05.720 --> 01:57:07.960]   the Daily Mail in the UK.
[01:57:07.960 --> 01:57:10.920]   What?
[01:57:10.920 --> 01:57:13.400]   Greg, tell us about the Daily Mail.
[01:57:13.400 --> 01:57:17.360]   - So the Daily Mail is a phenomenally huge media platform.
[01:57:17.360 --> 01:57:20.280]   They do a lot of, it's called a tabloid.
[01:57:20.280 --> 01:57:23.560]   It's very big on putting together beat up headlines.
[01:57:23.560 --> 01:57:25.440]   - I've been told that if I see a story
[01:57:25.440 --> 01:57:27.720]   in the Daily Mail, I should not repeat it.
[01:57:27.720 --> 01:57:29.120]   - That's generally a good idea
[01:57:29.120 --> 01:57:31.280]   and also question the validity of the truth.
[01:57:31.280 --> 01:57:32.480]   - Exactly, yes.
[01:57:32.480 --> 01:57:35.120]   - If you think BuzzFeed invented the catchy headline,
[01:57:35.120 --> 01:57:37.200]   these guys were doing it years and years ago
[01:57:37.200 --> 01:57:41.200]   in the days of real media and have done for like 30 years,
[01:57:41.200 --> 01:57:43.360]   they get an astonishing amount of traffic.
[01:57:43.360 --> 01:57:44.960]   I can't remember the numbers off the top of my head,
[01:57:44.960 --> 01:57:48.360]   but it's absolutely one of the top five web properties
[01:57:48.360 --> 01:57:49.480]   in the world.
[01:57:49.480 --> 01:57:53.200]   And for them to get onto Yahoo means they want that content
[01:57:53.200 --> 01:57:54.960]   platform to drive them all.
[01:57:54.960 --> 01:57:56.800]   The same reason that Verizon's in the ring,
[01:57:56.800 --> 01:57:59.400]   although my understanding about Verizon
[01:57:59.400 --> 01:58:02.440]   is that they're exploiting the network
[01:58:02.440 --> 01:58:05.400]   as a way of generating higher revenues around the ad tech.
[01:58:05.400 --> 01:58:09.400]   That is, by buying AOL and HuffPo a few years ago,
[01:58:09.400 --> 01:58:12.520]   Verizon was able to get much better ad tech play
[01:58:12.520 --> 01:58:15.720]   because they can see people traversing the Verizon network
[01:58:15.720 --> 01:58:18.640]   and as well as what's happening on the actual side of--
[01:58:18.640 --> 01:58:20.880]   - Huge value to that, isn't it?
[01:58:20.880 --> 01:58:21.720]   - Yeah.
[01:58:21.720 --> 01:58:24.760]   - There's a $24 billion market in carriers
[01:58:24.760 --> 01:58:28.320]   selling data to the ad tech brokers
[01:58:28.320 --> 01:58:29.800]   about the traffic that's crossing.
[01:58:29.800 --> 01:58:33.080]   So your personal data is identified on the internet,
[01:58:33.080 --> 01:58:35.880]   on those MPLS backbones, on those fat pipes,
[01:58:35.880 --> 01:58:38.320]   and they sell that data for billions and billions
[01:58:38.320 --> 01:58:40.920]   of dollars worth of revenue every single year.
[01:58:40.920 --> 01:58:45.400]   So if Verizon can use that to know how much money
[01:58:45.400 --> 01:58:48.240]   these ad tech companies are making,
[01:58:48.240 --> 01:58:50.720]   then it makes sense for Verizon to throw it's hat
[01:58:50.720 --> 01:58:53.240]   in the ring for Yahoo as well because now it gets to see
[01:58:53.240 --> 01:58:56.160]   the content and the network and they can exploit
[01:58:56.160 --> 01:58:59.360]   that data science to give you the ads that you really
[01:58:59.360 --> 01:59:02.160]   want to see and drive much more revenue out of the network,
[01:59:02.160 --> 01:59:04.200]   not just as selling bandwidth.
[01:59:04.200 --> 01:59:06.440]   - Clearly the Daily Mail's already doing that
[01:59:06.440 --> 01:59:08.280]   'cause I just went to the Daily Mail
[01:59:08.280 --> 01:59:11.480]   and so UK publication, but they clearly know
[01:59:11.480 --> 01:59:12.640]   that I'm coming in from the US
[01:59:12.640 --> 01:59:15.200]   'cause every story in here is US focused.
[01:59:15.200 --> 01:59:19.000]   I doubt anybody in the UK knows Megan Kelly from Fox News,
[01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:22.520]   but of course she's been written quite a bit about
[01:59:22.520 --> 01:59:25.400]   because of her feud with Donald Trump
[01:59:25.400 --> 01:59:28.400]   and here are some paparazzi pictures of Megan Kelly,
[01:59:28.400 --> 01:59:32.080]   that's on the top, the New Orleans Saint football player
[01:59:32.080 --> 01:59:35.400]   who was killed in a road rage incident yesterday,
[01:59:35.400 --> 01:59:38.720]   the female Texas teacher who was arrested
[01:59:38.720 --> 01:59:40.960]   after being caught repeatedly hitting a male student
[01:59:40.960 --> 01:59:44.880]   around the head then mocking him when he complains,
[01:59:44.880 --> 01:59:47.000]   that's all US stories.
[01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:48.480]   Now I bet you that's not what you see
[01:59:48.480 --> 01:59:51.240]   if you go to the Daily Mail's website.
[01:59:51.240 --> 01:59:54.160]   - Absolutely not, I'm seeing a completely different
[01:59:54.160 --> 01:59:57.680]   employee who left golf in a sheep field, wins the masters.
[01:59:57.680 --> 02:00:00.320]   Obviously that's some sort of sports ball thing.
[02:00:00.320 --> 02:00:01.320]   - Sports ball yeah.
[02:00:01.320 --> 02:00:02.160]   Yeah.
[02:00:03.880 --> 02:00:06.560]   - Oh, what do you think Yahoo's worth
[02:00:06.560 --> 02:00:09.760]   and who should buy Yahoo or is this just a fire sale
[02:00:09.760 --> 02:00:11.680]   and it's just the end of the line?
[02:00:11.680 --> 02:00:13.240]   - I don't think it's a fire sale.
[02:00:13.240 --> 02:00:16.720]   I think Verizon is probably the most likely buyer here
[02:00:16.720 --> 02:00:22.080]   because of all the reasons Greg's just mentioned
[02:00:22.080 --> 02:00:27.080]   and I think they will probably make a very reasonable bid
[02:00:27.080 --> 02:00:29.200]   for this company.
[02:00:29.200 --> 02:00:33.720]   I think that data brokerage business is huge.
[02:00:33.720 --> 02:00:37.000]   I think people are still struggling to figure out
[02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:40.600]   how to tie web data with mobile users
[02:00:40.600 --> 02:00:44.200]   and I think this is another way of Verizon
[02:00:44.200 --> 02:00:49.040]   to be able to bridge that gap of mobile and web information.
[02:00:49.040 --> 02:00:51.400]   So, you know, if I was a betting man,
[02:00:51.400 --> 02:00:54.320]   I would bet pretty hard on Verizon.
[02:00:54.320 --> 02:00:57.200]   My number two pick would be Time Warner.
[02:00:57.200 --> 02:01:00.920]   I think Time Warner also has a reasonable chart
[02:01:00.920 --> 02:01:03.040]   at making a play for Yahoo.
[02:01:03.040 --> 02:01:06.240]   Though I don't think they have that kind of,
[02:01:06.240 --> 02:01:10.640]   you know, the money power as Verizon has.
[02:01:10.640 --> 02:01:14.040]   So I would pay close attention to those two.
[02:01:14.040 --> 02:01:19.040]   I think that the number of people who use Yahoo
[02:01:19.040 --> 02:01:22.320]   on a daily basis, the traffic has some value
[02:01:22.320 --> 02:01:27.120]   for companies like Verizon and Time Warner.
[02:01:27.120 --> 02:01:30.760]   But if it was, you know, as an, you know,
[02:01:30.760 --> 02:01:32.280]   it is not a growing business.
[02:01:32.280 --> 02:01:34.480]   It's a growing business for people
[02:01:34.480 --> 02:01:37.760]   who actually have something to tie it to.
[02:01:37.760 --> 02:01:39.680]   And I think Verizon is the best bet.
[02:01:39.680 --> 02:01:44.680]   - So you're not buying Yahoo's content sites.
[02:01:44.680 --> 02:01:46.960]   You're not, you're buying,
[02:01:46.960 --> 02:01:50.080]   and you're not quite buying its audience, you're buying data.
[02:01:50.080 --> 02:01:52.400]   - Yeah, pretty much.
[02:01:52.400 --> 02:01:54.200]   I mean, that's what it really is all about.
[02:01:54.200 --> 02:01:55.960]   - Isn't that interesting?
[02:01:55.960 --> 02:01:58.520]   And just because they have such massive traffic,
[02:01:58.520 --> 02:02:01.080]   they have a lot of interesting data
[02:02:01.080 --> 02:02:02.800]   about their users.
[02:02:02.800 --> 02:02:04.000]   - That's right.
[02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:04.840]   - Wow.
[02:02:04.840 --> 02:02:08.200]   - That's all most media sites are.
[02:02:08.200 --> 02:02:11.640]   They're data sources for tracking you across the internet.
[02:02:11.640 --> 02:02:13.000]   And that data is very valuable
[02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:14.680]   and can be exploited for money.
[02:02:14.680 --> 02:02:17.160]   Media companies have been making money off ads,
[02:02:17.160 --> 02:02:22.160]   but ads have become tracking tools about your behavior.
[02:02:22.160 --> 02:02:23.000]   - Yeah.
[02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:24.560]   - Say that we track the ads
[02:02:24.560 --> 02:02:26.440]   so that we can show you the best quality ad.
[02:02:26.440 --> 02:02:28.840]   But what we actually want to be able to do is
[02:02:28.840 --> 02:02:30.440]   target you in multiple ways,
[02:02:30.440 --> 02:02:31.400]   not just one way.
[02:02:31.400 --> 02:02:35.960]   - Wait, it really is an interesting
[02:02:35.960 --> 02:02:41.560]   reformulation of what content is, of what journalism is.
[02:02:41.560 --> 02:02:43.920]   - You can do this.
[02:02:43.920 --> 02:02:45.640]   - Sorry, I'm...
[02:02:45.640 --> 02:02:46.440]   - Now go for it.
[02:02:46.440 --> 02:02:48.840]   - Our content is really just a way
[02:02:48.840 --> 02:02:51.280]   of generating data science or data lakes,
[02:02:51.280 --> 02:02:53.280]   - That's so depressing.
[02:02:53.280 --> 02:02:55.200]   - That we can then feed into the algorithms
[02:02:55.200 --> 02:02:59.400]   to extract metadata and trends and analysis.
[02:02:59.400 --> 02:03:00.760]   - What is that data worth though,
[02:03:00.760 --> 02:03:02.880]   if it's not about showing ads?
[02:03:02.880 --> 02:03:05.680]   What else would we do with that?
[02:03:05.680 --> 02:03:09.720]   - Today they're using it for political science.
[02:03:09.720 --> 02:03:12.760]   They're using it for medical health research,
[02:03:12.760 --> 02:03:14.600]   sentiment analysis,
[02:03:14.600 --> 02:03:17.040]   marketing companies are using it to determine
[02:03:17.040 --> 02:03:20.720]   whether people are responding to ad campaigns or trending.
[02:03:20.720 --> 02:03:23.200]   Are people talking about their products in public?
[02:03:23.200 --> 02:03:24.320]   Are people...
[02:03:24.320 --> 02:03:28.680]   Is the audience engaging with your brand in some way?
[02:03:28.680 --> 02:03:31.200]   I mean, are people mentioning Coca-Cola on Twitter?
[02:03:31.200 --> 02:03:32.840]   Are people talking about your...
[02:03:32.840 --> 02:03:33.680]   - Oh, that's disgusting.
[02:03:33.680 --> 02:03:36.560]   - ... your Revolve or your IoT strategy?
[02:03:36.560 --> 02:03:40.080]   That sort of sentiment analysis is huge
[02:03:40.080 --> 02:03:41.880]   in terms of being able to say,
[02:03:41.880 --> 02:03:44.360]   I ran a marketing strategy I've just spent.
[02:03:44.360 --> 02:03:48.760]   Have you seen there was a video this week
[02:03:48.760 --> 02:03:52.520]   from the guy who owns the Game of War?
[02:03:52.520 --> 02:03:55.440]   One of the top five games on the iTunes store.
[02:03:55.440 --> 02:03:57.520]   And he was talking that they're now spending
[02:03:57.520 --> 02:04:01.240]   over 500 million a year in spend
[02:04:01.240 --> 02:04:05.920]   on promoting that game in the iTunes and the Android app stores.
[02:04:05.920 --> 02:04:08.360]   It's now one of the second or third largest.
[02:04:08.360 --> 02:04:11.360]   It's making over $2 billion a year in revenue.
[02:04:11.360 --> 02:04:14.400]   And he built his own media and ad tech team
[02:04:14.400 --> 02:04:16.720]   because he fundamentally believes that the media companies
[02:04:16.720 --> 02:04:20.160]   are all lying, stealing, thieving, buggers.
[02:04:20.160 --> 02:04:22.400]   And he wants them to stop.
[02:04:22.400 --> 02:04:24.160]   He doesn't trust them to deliver ads.
[02:04:24.160 --> 02:04:27.120]   And he has to justify every single spend.
[02:04:27.120 --> 02:04:30.240]   So he has his own ways of tracking all of that sentiment.
[02:04:30.240 --> 02:04:33.400]   And he just basically said that I get all the data
[02:04:33.400 --> 02:04:34.440]   about when it's delivered.
[02:04:34.440 --> 02:04:37.040]   I know when people react to that and buy my game
[02:04:37.040 --> 02:04:38.360]   and make money for me.
[02:04:38.360 --> 02:04:40.000]   And I will no longer trust me.
[02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:43.080]   All he wants is a way to know if his marketing
[02:04:43.080 --> 02:04:45.720]   is actually generating a return.
[02:04:45.720 --> 02:04:47.680]   - Last year in four months,
[02:04:47.680 --> 02:04:52.720]   Game of War spent $40 million on its Kate Upton campaign.
[02:04:52.720 --> 02:04:55.760]   I'm sure many of you saw those ads.
[02:04:55.760 --> 02:04:57.640]   $10 million a month.
[02:04:57.640 --> 02:04:59.280]   And that's a free app.
[02:04:59.280 --> 02:05:03.800]   Although you might have also seen stories about like the one
[02:05:03.800 --> 02:05:05.680]   a couple of years ago with the Belgian teenager
[02:05:05.680 --> 02:05:10.080]   who spent $46,000 on Game of War merchandise
[02:05:10.080 --> 02:05:13.680]   in the Game of War store for a free app.
[02:05:13.680 --> 02:05:16.560]   And as somebody who's personally spent $300 on Simpsons
[02:05:16.560 --> 02:05:19.600]   donuts, I kind of understand how that is.
[02:05:19.600 --> 02:05:23.040]   - Once you get hooked on that, you just can't stop.
[02:05:23.040 --> 02:05:26.120]   - Well, this is actually a serious issue.
[02:05:26.120 --> 02:05:28.960]   It's addictive and these guys are designing games
[02:05:28.960 --> 02:05:31.160]   to be as addictive as possible, right, Georgia?
[02:05:31.160 --> 02:05:34.680]   I mean, they're using serious addiction theory
[02:05:34.680 --> 02:05:37.680]   to grab you and keep you.
[02:05:37.680 --> 02:05:38.520]   - Oh yeah.
[02:05:38.520 --> 02:05:39.360]   And it makes a killing.
[02:05:39.360 --> 02:05:41.920]   I spent $2.99 just yesterday on--
[02:05:41.920 --> 02:05:42.760]   - $2.99.
[02:05:42.760 --> 02:05:47.520]   - $2.99 on Candy Crush.
[02:05:47.520 --> 02:05:49.000]   And I said I was never--
[02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:49.840]   - I don't want to.
[02:05:49.840 --> 02:05:50.680]   - Spent any more money on it.
[02:05:50.680 --> 02:05:52.840]   And I did, 'cause I wanted to pass that level
[02:05:52.840 --> 02:05:55.480]   unfortunately games can give you the same amount of addiction
[02:05:55.480 --> 02:05:57.240]   as cocaine can.
[02:05:57.240 --> 02:05:59.920]   And it gives you this one, immediate C2,
[02:05:59.920 --> 02:06:01.280]   it gives you a rush of dopamine,
[02:06:01.280 --> 02:06:03.680]   which makes you feel good and powerful.
[02:06:03.680 --> 02:06:05.280]   And we like that feeling.
[02:06:05.280 --> 02:06:06.920]   And it's a great avoidance technique.
[02:06:06.920 --> 02:06:08.240]   So instead of doing your taxes,
[02:06:08.240 --> 02:06:09.640]   you're gonna play a video game instead
[02:06:09.640 --> 02:06:11.960]   and feel a little bit better about it.
[02:06:11.960 --> 02:06:14.120]   And so the games can market off of that
[02:06:14.120 --> 02:06:16.600]   and keep us coming back for more
[02:06:16.600 --> 02:06:18.840]   by giving you just a little bit of dopamine
[02:06:18.840 --> 02:06:21.280]   and it ends up being the same thing
[02:06:21.280 --> 02:06:22.560]   like the guy around the corner.
[02:06:22.560 --> 02:06:25.400]   - It's a Skinner box, as Beatmaster said.
[02:06:25.400 --> 02:06:31.600]   The father of operant conditioning showed that rats would--
[02:06:31.600 --> 02:06:38.760]   Rats would press a button forever to the point of death.
[02:06:38.760 --> 02:06:42.440]   If you just gave them a little reward every once in a while.
[02:06:42.440 --> 02:06:44.400]   Average of, well look at this.
[02:06:44.400 --> 02:06:46.280]   There's a headline from April Fool's Day,
[02:06:46.280 --> 02:06:47.880]   but this one's true.
[02:06:47.880 --> 02:06:52.240]   Game of war is paying players spend an average average
[02:06:52.240 --> 02:06:56.400]   of $550 each in 2015.
[02:06:56.400 --> 02:06:57.680]   Is it that good a game?
[02:06:57.680 --> 02:06:59.960]   No, but it's not about that.
[02:06:59.960 --> 02:07:01.440]   In fact, I would be willing to bet
[02:07:01.440 --> 02:07:03.360]   that most people who play games like this,
[02:07:03.360 --> 02:07:06.960]   I know I'm one of them, didn't really enjoy it.
[02:07:06.960 --> 02:07:10.120]   Felt bad about it.
[02:07:10.120 --> 02:07:12.280]   I realized when I was getting up in the morning
[02:07:12.280 --> 02:07:17.120]   to harvest my crops in we rule every morning
[02:07:17.120 --> 02:07:18.600]   that there was something wrong.
[02:07:18.600 --> 02:07:20.880]   - Yeah.
[02:07:20.880 --> 02:07:22.480]   - I defeated that game.
[02:07:22.480 --> 02:07:23.320]   - Good for you.
[02:07:23.320 --> 02:07:25.120]   - So Game of War's number one.
[02:07:25.120 --> 02:07:26.800]   I gotta download that and try it.
[02:07:26.800 --> 02:07:27.800]   (laughing)
[02:07:27.800 --> 02:07:28.640]   - You should answer.
[02:07:28.640 --> 02:07:29.480]   Don't do it.
[02:07:29.480 --> 02:07:33.360]   - Kate Upton, they don't pay her more money.
[02:07:33.360 --> 02:07:35.480]   'Cause by the way, she's not in that game.
[02:07:35.480 --> 02:07:38.640]   - She looks fabulous in the advertisement.
[02:07:38.640 --> 02:07:41.000]   - Yeah, where's that buxom young lady in the game?
[02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:41.840]   Nowhere.
[02:07:41.840 --> 02:07:47.320]   So, why didn't Yahoo just do this themselves?
[02:07:47.320 --> 02:07:50.520]   Why are they, why, I mean, isn't this a strategy
[02:07:50.520 --> 02:07:53.440]   that could have kept them alive?
[02:07:53.440 --> 02:07:56.080]   Mine that data, sell it to Game of War people.
[02:07:56.080 --> 02:08:01.560]   - The Yahoo data, just by Yahoo data didn't,
[02:08:01.560 --> 02:08:02.760]   wasn't that valuable.
[02:08:02.760 --> 02:08:05.880]   I think when combined with Verizon data,
[02:08:05.880 --> 02:08:08.920]   it is more valuable when combined with houseper
[02:08:08.920 --> 02:08:13.920]   and tech, you know, the AOL, it's a lot more valuable.
[02:08:13.920 --> 02:08:16.760]   - But couldn't they have just, or maybe they still will
[02:08:16.760 --> 02:08:19.520]   do a deal and just say, well, we'll sell you the data.
[02:08:20.520 --> 02:08:23.040]   - Or maybe they just don't want to be in the business anymore.
[02:08:23.040 --> 02:08:24.240]   Just say, you take it.
[02:08:24.240 --> 02:08:26.600]   They could probably get a better exit.
[02:08:26.600 --> 02:08:28.040]   Actually, come to think of it,
[02:08:28.040 --> 02:08:31.440]   this is really being forced by activist investors
[02:08:31.440 --> 02:08:34.500]   on the board, the board itself,
[02:08:34.500 --> 02:08:37.200]   have all thrown in the towel and they're saying,
[02:08:37.200 --> 02:08:39.480]   let's just get what we can for it.
[02:08:39.480 --> 02:08:41.040]   Right?
[02:08:41.040 --> 02:08:41.880]   - It seems like it.
[02:08:41.880 --> 02:08:45.600]   I think the, you know, one of the articles I wrote
[02:08:45.600 --> 02:08:50.120]   about Yahoo was pointing out that like, you know,
[02:08:50.120 --> 02:08:53.840]   all social services and all web services
[02:08:53.840 --> 02:08:55.800]   have an expiration date.
[02:08:55.800 --> 02:08:58.200]   I think you grow older with your audience.
[02:08:58.200 --> 02:09:00.880]   I think you see that happening with Facebook.
[02:09:00.880 --> 02:09:02.160]   - That's interesting.
[02:09:02.160 --> 02:09:06.440]   - Like just like television services and the music services,
[02:09:06.440 --> 02:09:09.000]   everything just, you know, the audience grows older
[02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:12.200]   and when you get older, you become less, you know,
[02:09:12.200 --> 02:09:13.840]   attractive to advertisers.
[02:09:13.840 --> 02:09:14.680]   - Right.
[02:09:14.680 --> 02:09:17.320]   - The new behaviors of the internet are elsewhere.
[02:09:17.320 --> 02:09:20.040]   So the attention shifts, the attention shift
[02:09:20.040 --> 02:09:22.240]   means you become less relevant.
[02:09:22.240 --> 02:09:24.320]   So it's not like Yahoo is dying,
[02:09:24.320 --> 02:09:27.280]   it's just becoming less and less relevant by the day.
[02:09:27.280 --> 02:09:30.720]   And as a result of that, its value keeps going down.
[02:09:30.720 --> 02:09:33.160]   And I think that's where they're at.
[02:09:33.160 --> 02:09:36.520]   Like their relevance to the modern web is very little,
[02:09:36.520 --> 02:09:40.240]   except for their selling this data around their own users,
[02:09:40.240 --> 02:09:43.680]   which is like the crumbiest position to be in.
[02:09:43.680 --> 02:09:45.480]   - That's a really, see again, Om,
[02:09:45.480 --> 02:09:50.480]   you really can, you're at a higher level of understanding
[02:09:50.480 --> 02:09:52.080]   of what's going on.
[02:09:52.080 --> 02:09:53.600]   And I think you kind of nailed it,
[02:09:53.600 --> 02:09:56.440]   which particularly for content companies,
[02:09:56.440 --> 02:09:59.400]   you have an age cohort that you appeal to
[02:09:59.400 --> 02:10:03.240]   and you age with, they age with you and you age with them.
[02:10:03.240 --> 02:10:06.160]   And there's no way of turning back the clock.
[02:10:06.160 --> 02:10:09.040]   Somebody you knew is gonna come along and get the 20 year old.
[02:10:09.040 --> 02:10:13.040]   And so basically I should just retire now.
[02:10:13.920 --> 02:10:15.680]   - You seem to be defying time.
[02:10:15.680 --> 02:10:16.680]   (laughing)
[02:10:16.680 --> 02:10:18.840]   - You're like Leo, you're like Madonna,
[02:10:18.840 --> 02:10:20.440]   you're evolving with the time.
[02:10:20.440 --> 02:10:25.440]   - Ah, I'm gonna do a video with dwarves and fire.
[02:10:25.440 --> 02:10:29.840]   And just-- - A dragon.
[02:10:29.840 --> 02:10:31.320]   - Dragon.
[02:10:31.320 --> 02:10:35.480]   Now I think that there are content categories.
[02:10:35.480 --> 02:10:37.960]   If you don't try to be trendy,
[02:10:37.960 --> 02:10:40.920]   there are content categories that have some interest
[02:10:40.920 --> 02:10:42.720]   that can continue to generate new audience.
[02:10:42.720 --> 02:10:45.480]   We, our audience is not aging,
[02:10:45.480 --> 02:10:48.220]   as far as we can tell and in our research.
[02:10:48.220 --> 02:10:52.960]   But that's because our audience is not about geography,
[02:10:52.960 --> 02:10:54.800]   it's not about demographics,
[02:10:54.800 --> 02:10:58.240]   it's about people who are interested in particular thing,
[02:10:58.240 --> 02:11:00.440]   technology and using technology.
[02:11:00.440 --> 02:11:03.160]   And as long as people are interested in that, I hope.
[02:11:03.160 --> 02:11:05.760]   I mean, I wanna do this forever, I don't expect
[02:11:05.760 --> 02:11:08.200]   to sell the company, I think it'll die out of natural death,
[02:11:08.200 --> 02:11:11.760]   but I hate to, I don't want it to be premature.
[02:11:12.760 --> 02:11:14.720]   - It's interesting. - I think podcasting
[02:11:14.720 --> 02:11:16.560]   is really beginning to take off, so--
[02:11:16.560 --> 02:11:19.080]   - Oh good, thank God, oh my God, it's about time.
[02:11:19.080 --> 02:11:20.880]   (laughing)
[02:11:20.880 --> 02:11:23.760]   - I mean, it's not exactly a hockey stick of excitement
[02:11:23.760 --> 02:11:25.520]   that we know we're not going to be.
[02:11:25.520 --> 02:11:28.560]   But the research that I've been reading up,
[02:11:28.560 --> 02:11:30.360]   from Neiman Lab at various places
[02:11:30.360 --> 02:11:32.480]   is that there's a steady trajectory of growth.
[02:11:32.480 --> 02:11:34.040]   I mean, I recently-- - I actually don't think
[02:11:34.040 --> 02:11:36.120]   that's good for us, to be honest with you.
[02:11:36.120 --> 02:11:38.840]   I think that that's brought in competition.
[02:11:38.840 --> 02:11:40.360]   We dominated for so long,
[02:11:40.360 --> 02:11:42.400]   and I think now there's a lot of choices
[02:11:42.400 --> 02:11:43.520]   in the podcast space,
[02:11:43.520 --> 02:11:45.760]   and I think that that's brought in competition.
[02:11:45.760 --> 02:11:47.200]   - It's true. - Well everyone,
[02:11:47.200 --> 02:11:48.760]   and their dog has a podcast. - It's diluted us.
[02:11:48.760 --> 02:11:51.200]   - Yes, diluted. - Yeah, makes it harder
[02:11:51.200 --> 02:11:53.280]   to find sponsorship. - Our audiences
[02:11:53.280 --> 02:11:55.800]   are not going down, our audiences are going up,
[02:11:55.800 --> 02:11:58.360]   but the ad dollar is diluted.
[02:11:58.360 --> 02:12:01.040]   - Yeah. - So that means there's,
[02:12:01.040 --> 02:12:04.280]   and what's unfortunate, and maybe this'll be fixed,
[02:12:04.280 --> 02:12:06.600]   ad spend has not gone up with the increase
[02:12:06.600 --> 02:12:08.080]   in interest in podcast.
[02:12:08.080 --> 02:12:11.280]   You would think that Procter and Gamble
[02:12:11.280 --> 02:12:15.440]   and big companies would start going to podcast advertising
[02:12:15.440 --> 02:12:17.800]   as their mainstream media advertising starts
[02:12:17.800 --> 02:12:20.600]   to become less efficient and less effective,
[02:12:20.600 --> 02:12:21.640]   but they're not.
[02:12:21.640 --> 02:12:24.120]   I don't think there's been an overall increase in the pool.
[02:12:24.120 --> 02:12:26.840]   There's just been a larger number of people splitting the pool,
[02:12:26.840 --> 02:12:28.520]   but maybe that'll change.
[02:12:28.520 --> 02:12:33.520]   - I think that the advertising grows at the rate of the GDP.
[02:12:33.520 --> 02:12:36.200]   It doesn't grow any faster. - Oh, interesting.
[02:12:36.200 --> 02:12:39.080]   So if you look at it, it's just a little very tiny variance
[02:12:39.080 --> 02:12:42.080]   on the GDP growth and advertising dollar growth.
[02:12:42.080 --> 02:12:44.920]   So, I think a lot of what you're seeing
[02:12:44.920 --> 02:12:48.040]   is more competition for the same amount of dollars.
[02:12:48.040 --> 02:12:51.120]   And I think people who have the most amount of attention
[02:12:51.120 --> 02:12:52.600]   are getting most amount of dollars.
[02:12:52.600 --> 02:12:56.600]   That being people like Facebook and Google
[02:12:56.600 --> 02:12:59.240]   are sucking up most of the digital dollars.
[02:12:59.240 --> 02:13:02.160]   YouTube is taking a lot of the digital dollars,
[02:13:02.160 --> 02:13:05.320]   and some of the television dollars are going to,
[02:13:05.320 --> 02:13:07.360]   places like YouTube, podcasts.
[02:13:07.360 --> 02:13:12.360]   And so, this is just the slicing and dicing of the pie
[02:13:12.360 --> 02:13:16.040]   is changing.
[02:13:16.040 --> 02:13:21.040]   And I don't think folks like you have anything to worry about
[02:13:21.040 --> 02:13:26.680]   because you serve a very strong niche
[02:13:26.680 --> 02:13:28.680]   with a very strong point of view.
[02:13:28.680 --> 02:13:29.520]   - Right.
[02:13:29.520 --> 02:13:33.440]   - And you have, you actually remember who you are.
[02:13:33.440 --> 02:13:37.240]   I think we talked about Matchable a little while ago.
[02:13:37.240 --> 02:13:42.080]   And sometimes when you go too far away from your core,
[02:13:42.080 --> 02:13:45.760]   you lose your core audience and you actually start to value
[02:13:45.760 --> 02:13:47.400]   why people come to you.
[02:13:47.400 --> 02:13:52.400]   I think the reason to come to Leo hasn't changed
[02:13:52.400 --> 02:13:57.400]   in last close to 16, 17 years, in no sense.
[02:13:57.400 --> 02:13:59.800]   - Yeah, I think you're right.
[02:13:59.800 --> 02:14:01.960]   - I watched you on screen savers.
[02:14:01.960 --> 02:14:04.440]   You were very current then and I watch you now
[02:14:04.440 --> 02:14:05.280]   and you're very current.
[02:14:05.280 --> 02:14:09.520]   And I think that is what will keep you in business
[02:14:09.520 --> 02:14:13.280]   by being, you know, regenerating yourself by the day.
[02:14:13.280 --> 02:14:15.720]   I think that that's technology.
[02:14:15.720 --> 02:14:18.360]   - I'd like to think, I'd like to say that I'm smart enough
[02:14:18.360 --> 02:14:20.640]   not to have tried to be trendy or follow the trends,
[02:14:20.640 --> 02:14:22.840]   but I think it's really just that I'm lazy.
[02:14:22.840 --> 02:14:26.680]   And I just don't, I'm not really interested in innovating
[02:14:26.680 --> 02:14:28.040]   in any way.
[02:14:28.040 --> 02:14:29.640]   I just wanna keep doing it, you know?
[02:14:29.640 --> 02:14:31.400]   - Well, I tell you what I'm waiting for, Leo.
[02:14:31.400 --> 02:14:33.320]   I'm waiting for radio to shut down.
[02:14:33.320 --> 02:14:34.480]   I think that the data--
[02:14:34.480 --> 02:14:36.560]   - That may be, there may be a big transfer of money
[02:14:36.560 --> 02:14:37.640]   at that point, won't there?
[02:14:37.640 --> 02:14:38.480]   - Yes.
[02:14:38.480 --> 02:14:39.320]   - Yeah.
[02:14:39.320 --> 02:14:40.760]   - And I think there was an article today
[02:14:40.760 --> 02:14:43.400]   talking about one of the biggest radio networks in the US
[02:14:43.400 --> 02:14:45.600]   is actually on the edge of bankruptcy and shit.
[02:14:45.600 --> 02:14:47.320]   - Yeah, that's the one I work for, by the way.
[02:14:47.320 --> 02:14:50.480]   It's $20 billion in debt.
[02:14:50.480 --> 02:14:52.480]   How do you get $20 billion in debt?
[02:14:52.480 --> 02:14:55.400]   Who gives you money after the first few billion?
[02:14:55.400 --> 02:14:56.640]   Who gives you more money?
[02:14:56.640 --> 02:14:58.560]   - Well, we've got to double down.
[02:14:58.560 --> 02:15:00.080]   That's called venture capitalism.
[02:15:00.080 --> 02:15:02.760]   So yeah, that's a clear channel.
[02:15:02.760 --> 02:15:04.880]   The syndicator of my radio show is Premier,
[02:15:04.880 --> 02:15:07.160]   which is a clear channel division.
[02:15:07.160 --> 02:15:10.840]   There's $20 billion in debt and owes some significant,
[02:15:10.840 --> 02:15:13.040]   you know, balloon payments.
[02:15:13.040 --> 02:15:14.040]   - And I think also when we--
[02:15:14.040 --> 02:15:14.880]   - It's a terrible business.
[02:15:14.880 --> 02:15:17.240]   You don't wanna be in the radio business these days.
[02:15:17.240 --> 02:15:18.280]   - And I'm also hopeful--
[02:15:18.280 --> 02:15:19.440]   - Or I heart radio, I guess.
[02:15:19.440 --> 02:15:21.600]   - For my business in terms of when we start seeing
[02:15:21.600 --> 02:15:24.480]   podcast hardware in cars.
[02:15:24.480 --> 02:15:27.600]   So today people consume radio shows in the car--
[02:15:27.600 --> 02:15:29.880]   - No, as soon as smartphones and Bluetooth
[02:15:29.880 --> 02:15:32.040]   were ubiquitous, that was it for radio.
[02:15:32.040 --> 02:15:34.880]   And that was the growth of podcasting, right?
[02:15:34.880 --> 02:15:36.680]   - Yeah, I believe so.
[02:15:36.680 --> 02:15:37.520]   - Yeah.
[02:15:37.520 --> 02:15:38.360]   - Yeah.
[02:15:38.360 --> 02:15:39.960]   - Most of the people listen to a podcast
[02:15:39.960 --> 02:15:41.760]   while they're doing something else and driving--
[02:15:41.760 --> 02:15:42.600]   - Driving's big.
[02:15:42.600 --> 02:15:44.160]   - That's a great time, yeah.
[02:15:44.160 --> 02:15:46.160]   - Ira Glass, who does This American Life,
[02:15:46.160 --> 02:15:48.280]   which is probably the greatest radio show of all time,
[02:15:48.280 --> 02:15:52.480]   and has made a pretty good transition from radio only
[02:15:52.480 --> 02:15:55.760]   to radio plus podcasts, spoke at South by Southwest
[02:15:55.760 --> 02:15:56.720]   a couple of weeks ago.
[02:15:56.720 --> 02:15:58.680]   He gave one of the closing talks.
[02:15:58.680 --> 02:16:03.520]   He says, "It's a boom time for podcast advertising."
[02:16:03.520 --> 02:16:07.960]   He says, "CPMs, the cost for a thousand impressions,
[02:16:07.960 --> 02:16:11.400]   "sometimes reach 50 to 60 dollars for ads.
[02:16:11.400 --> 02:16:13.920]   "It's crazy, it's amazing, it's unbelievable."
[02:16:13.920 --> 02:16:18.080]   This is a quote, "It's boom time, it's a bubble."
[02:16:18.080 --> 02:16:19.880]   What Ira doesn't know is we've been charging that much
[02:16:19.880 --> 02:16:24.880]   for about 10 years now, so I hope it's not a bubble.
[02:16:24.880 --> 02:16:27.480]   'Cause you know what happens to bubbles?
[02:16:27.480 --> 02:16:28.720]   - Yeah.
[02:16:28.720 --> 02:16:29.920]   - They boish.
[02:16:29.920 --> 02:16:32.040]   I don't like to be trendy.
[02:16:32.040 --> 02:16:34.080]   Look what I'm wearing, a cardigan.
[02:16:34.080 --> 02:16:35.680]   (laughing)
[02:16:35.680 --> 02:16:38.800]   I'm just, you know, I'm basically saying I'm an old man,
[02:16:38.800 --> 02:16:41.320]   it's cold, I'm gonna have soup for dinner,
[02:16:41.320 --> 02:16:46.160]   then take a selfie on the sofa while I eat my Ben and Jerry's.
[02:16:46.160 --> 02:16:47.560]   - You don't have to say it, Leo.
[02:16:47.560 --> 02:16:49.820]   (laughing)
[02:16:49.820 --> 02:16:55.000]   - I mean, look at me, I'm not wearing my bathrobe.
[02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:57.120]   Did I actually put a shirt on and brush my hair?
[02:16:57.120 --> 02:16:59.440]   For all we know, you're not even wearing pants.
[02:16:59.440 --> 02:17:02.560]   - That's a great podcast.
[02:17:02.560 --> 02:17:04.000]   (laughing)
[02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:06.760]   - Greg Ferro, pack of pushers.
[02:17:06.760 --> 02:17:10.320]   Everybody should listen pack pushers.net from iMore.
[02:17:10.320 --> 02:17:14.240]   And what is your podcast, The Vector?
[02:17:14.240 --> 02:17:17.640]   - We do isometric podcast, which version--
[02:17:17.640 --> 02:17:19.920]   - Well, you only do geometry?
[02:17:19.920 --> 02:17:22.240]   - We do, no, it's a gaming podcast.
[02:17:22.240 --> 02:17:23.080]   - Oh, okay.
[02:17:23.080 --> 02:17:24.160]   - But now we're calling it this part.
[02:17:24.160 --> 02:17:26.440]   And also we have The iMore Show.
[02:17:26.440 --> 02:17:27.320]   And iMore Show.
[02:17:27.320 --> 02:17:31.600]   And of course, you've got to go to anxiety-videos.com
[02:17:31.600 --> 02:17:36.600]   because there's some great, great stuff there, I gotta say.
[02:17:36.600 --> 02:17:40.360]   Also with us, Om Malik from Om.co, we'll wrap things up
[02:17:40.360 --> 02:17:43.520]   in just a little bit, but before we do,
[02:17:43.520 --> 02:17:46.360]   I do wanna let you know that we had some fun this week
[02:17:46.360 --> 02:17:50.240]   on Twitch and we have created a small movie
[02:17:50.240 --> 02:17:54.600]   for you to watch so that you can enjoy.
[02:17:54.600 --> 02:17:56.640]   - Previously, on Twitch.
[02:17:56.640 --> 02:17:59.560]   - A new sofa, the lift bit, answers the world's
[02:17:59.560 --> 02:18:02.000]   most critical feature request by adding
[02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:03.560]   smartphone control support.
[02:18:03.560 --> 02:18:04.680]   - That's pretty-- - I can't hear the money.
[02:18:04.680 --> 02:18:05.520]   I can't hear the price.
[02:18:05.520 --> 02:18:07.120]   I'm too busy dancing to the feelings.
[02:18:07.120 --> 02:18:08.200]   (laughing)
[02:18:08.200 --> 02:18:09.320]   - Triangulation.
[02:18:09.320 --> 02:18:10.600]   - We're talking to Bill Atkinson,
[02:18:10.600 --> 02:18:15.160]   the creator of Quickdraw, of Mac Paint, of Hypercard.
[02:18:15.160 --> 02:18:16.960]   - It's an interesting thing about that play numbers.
[02:18:16.960 --> 02:18:19.200]   Wozniak took in play number one.
[02:18:19.200 --> 02:18:21.240]   And Steve took in play number zero.
[02:18:21.240 --> 02:18:22.240]   (laughing)
[02:18:22.240 --> 02:18:23.120]   And then he coming down the hall,
[02:18:23.120 --> 02:18:24.640]   and he'll say, here comes the big zero.
[02:18:24.640 --> 02:18:26.720]   (laughing)
[02:18:26.720 --> 02:18:28.560]   This week in computer hardware.
[02:18:28.560 --> 02:18:29.840]   - HP announces the world's thinnest
[02:18:29.840 --> 02:18:34.480]   laptop, the Spectre 13.3's 10.4 millimeters.
[02:18:34.480 --> 02:18:37.040]   That's as thin as a triple A battery,
[02:18:37.040 --> 02:18:38.360]   but that looks like an absolutely
[02:18:38.360 --> 02:18:40.320]   utterly impressive piece of engineering.
[02:18:40.320 --> 02:18:41.400]   - Yep.
[02:18:41.400 --> 02:18:42.720]   - This week in Google.
[02:18:42.720 --> 02:18:45.160]   - Revolve, this is pissing me off.
[02:18:45.160 --> 02:18:48.400]   Nest has announced that they're gonna shut it down
[02:18:48.400 --> 02:18:50.400]   after May 15th, will no longer open,
[02:18:50.400 --> 02:18:51.600]   the hub won't work.
[02:18:51.600 --> 02:18:54.480]   You guys have demonstrated to everybody
[02:18:54.480 --> 02:18:57.200]   the real vulnerability of internet of things stuff.
[02:18:57.200 --> 02:18:59.760]   If it needs a server, you got a piece of hardware
[02:18:59.760 --> 02:19:00.680]   that doesn't work.
[02:19:00.680 --> 02:19:03.040]   - You want the definition of what's evil?
[02:19:03.040 --> 02:19:03.880]   - This is evil.
[02:19:03.880 --> 02:19:04.720]   - To it.
[02:19:04.720 --> 02:19:08.160]   Technology isn't always pretty, but we are.
[02:19:08.160 --> 02:19:09.120]   - Just got an idea, brilliant.
[02:19:09.120 --> 02:19:10.400]   This is my new show.
[02:19:10.400 --> 02:19:12.360]   Hot tub tech machine.
[02:19:12.360 --> 02:19:13.400]   (laughing)
[02:19:13.400 --> 02:19:15.280]   Live from Leo's Hot Tub.
[02:19:15.280 --> 02:19:17.320]   So if I have Robert Scoble come out,
[02:19:17.320 --> 02:19:18.520]   we'll get in the Hot Tub together,
[02:19:18.520 --> 02:19:19.720]   and we'll do,
[02:19:19.720 --> 02:19:20.800]   wouldn't that be a good show?
[02:19:20.800 --> 02:19:22.320]   - I'm a really forbidden visual.
[02:19:22.320 --> 02:19:23.320]   - Maybe not.
[02:19:23.320 --> 02:19:24.840]   (laughing)
[02:19:24.840 --> 02:19:26.040]   We got a big week ahead too.
[02:19:26.040 --> 02:19:28.400]   Jason Howell has the deets.
[02:19:28.400 --> 02:19:29.240]   - Thanks Leo.
[02:19:29.240 --> 02:19:31.320]   Here's a look at a few of the stories anyways
[02:19:31.320 --> 02:19:33.320]   that we're gonna be kind of keeping an eye on
[02:19:33.320 --> 02:19:35.000]   in the week ahead.
[02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:36.840]   Tuesday April 12th.
[02:19:36.840 --> 02:19:38.680]   It's kind of a big day, a couple of big things happening.
[02:19:38.680 --> 02:19:42.480]   First of all, HTC is going to be having,
[02:19:42.480 --> 02:19:46.160]   hopefully what is expected to be its flagship announcement
[02:19:46.160 --> 02:19:47.960]   for its new lineup of phones.
[02:19:47.960 --> 02:19:49.720]   Is it the HTC 10?
[02:19:50.640 --> 02:19:51.480]   You know, we don't know.
[02:19:51.480 --> 02:19:52.920]   We're gonna find out on Tuesday,
[02:19:52.920 --> 02:19:55.480]   might have a 5.15 inch display,
[02:19:55.480 --> 02:19:57.600]   Snapdragon 820 processor.
[02:19:57.600 --> 02:19:58.920]   Is it gonna save HTC?
[02:19:58.920 --> 02:20:00.520]   That's always the big question here.
[02:20:00.520 --> 02:20:02.000]   We're gonna find out on Tuesday.
[02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:05.640]   Also starting Tuesday and going through Wednesday April 13th
[02:20:05.640 --> 02:20:08.960]   is Facebook's F8 developer conference.
[02:20:08.960 --> 02:20:11.200]   Lots of things that Facebook's gonna show off there,
[02:20:11.200 --> 02:20:13.040]   including chatbots and messenger,
[02:20:13.040 --> 02:20:14.880]   and so much more.
[02:20:14.880 --> 02:20:18.280]   Leo and myself are actually gonna be on hand
[02:20:18.280 --> 02:20:22.760]   on Tuesday April 12th from 10 to 11 a.m. Pacific
[02:20:22.760 --> 02:20:24.800]   here at Twitch.tv/live
[02:20:24.800 --> 02:20:27.840]   to kind of talk about the keynote from the event
[02:20:27.840 --> 02:20:29.400]   and all of the implications there.
[02:20:29.400 --> 02:20:31.600]   And then of course later in the day on Tech News today,
[02:20:31.600 --> 02:20:33.520]   we're gonna talk all about it.
[02:20:33.520 --> 02:20:35.720]   So you'll wanna check that out.
[02:20:35.720 --> 02:20:38.600]   Don't forget, Mega Moroni and I do Tech News today
[02:20:38.600 --> 02:20:41.760]   every Monday through Friday at 4 p.m. Pacific
[02:20:41.760 --> 02:20:44.240]   at Twitch.tv/live.
[02:20:44.240 --> 02:20:45.400]   So you should definitely check that out
[02:20:45.400 --> 02:20:47.120]   to see all the things that are happening
[02:20:47.120 --> 02:20:48.560]   in the world of Tech News.
[02:20:48.560 --> 02:20:50.800]   That is about it for now.
[02:20:50.800 --> 02:20:51.600]   Back to you Leo.
[02:20:51.600 --> 02:20:53.080]   - Thank you Jason Howell.
[02:20:53.080 --> 02:20:54.640]   Jason as he mentioned will join me
[02:20:54.640 --> 02:20:57.200]   and Gina Trippani Tuesday morning,
[02:20:57.200 --> 02:21:01.200]   around 10 a.m. Pacific, 1 p.m. Eastern time 1700 UTC
[02:21:01.200 --> 02:21:05.160]   for our live coverage of the first of two keynotes
[02:21:05.160 --> 02:21:07.000]   at Facebook's F8 developer conference.
[02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:10.160]   If it turns out that we think there's more on Wednesday,
[02:21:10.160 --> 02:21:12.360]   there's a second keynote, we'll cover that live as well.
[02:21:12.360 --> 02:21:13.600]   It's never, you never can tell.
[02:21:13.600 --> 02:21:15.640]   Sometimes the second keynote is just,
[02:21:15.640 --> 02:21:17.120]   you know, very developer-y.
[02:21:17.120 --> 02:21:19.840]   But I'm really interested what Facebook has to say
[02:21:19.840 --> 02:21:23.600]   about this bot and messaging platform.
[02:21:23.600 --> 02:21:26.600]   I really feel like they have the inside track
[02:21:26.600 --> 02:21:28.440]   because so many people use Messenger,
[02:21:28.440 --> 02:21:31.360]   almost a billion active users now,
[02:21:31.360 --> 02:21:33.480]   which is mind boggling.
[02:21:33.480 --> 02:21:35.640]   Hey, we were talking about sleep a little bit earlier,
[02:21:35.640 --> 02:21:37.000]   our sponsor for this portion of the show,
[02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:40.720]   Casper, the best mattress ever!
[02:21:40.720 --> 02:21:44.120]   An online retailer of premium mattresses
[02:21:44.120 --> 02:21:45.640]   for a fraction of the cost.
[02:21:45.640 --> 02:21:50.480]   Why? Because they make their mattresses beautifully,
[02:21:50.480 --> 02:21:53.040]   obsessively engineered mattresses in the US,
[02:21:53.040 --> 02:21:55.320]   and then instead of putting them in a showroom
[02:21:55.320 --> 02:21:57.480]   and having to mark them up for that middleman,
[02:21:57.480 --> 02:21:59.880]   they sell them direct to you.
[02:21:59.880 --> 02:22:03.160]   And you know, I think when they probably pitched this,
[02:22:03.160 --> 02:22:05.080]   I would like to see their deck
[02:22:05.080 --> 02:22:06.760]   because I bet it was kind of like,
[02:22:06.760 --> 02:22:09.320]   "Look, no, we know people want to lie on mattresses
[02:22:09.320 --> 02:22:10.600]   "in the showroom, no, we know that,
[02:22:10.600 --> 02:22:13.320]   "and we know that shipping a mattress, that's crazy talk.
[02:22:13.320 --> 02:22:14.440]   "You're gonna ship a king's house."
[02:22:14.440 --> 02:22:17.560]   But we figured this out, and they have.
[02:22:17.560 --> 02:22:20.120]   So first of all, lying on a mattress in a showroom
[02:22:20.120 --> 02:22:21.560]   is no way to choose a mattress.
[02:22:21.560 --> 02:22:24.200]   I know that, I bought many a bad mattress
[02:22:24.200 --> 02:22:26.320]   'cause you can't really get into it, you know,
[02:22:26.320 --> 02:22:27.320]   on a showroom floor.
[02:22:27.320 --> 02:22:29.800]   Everybody's looking at you, there's bright lights.
[02:22:29.800 --> 02:22:32.720]   But with the McCasprey, you have 100 nights.
[02:22:32.720 --> 02:22:35.760]   You have 100 nights to lie on that mattress
[02:22:35.760 --> 02:22:38.960]   so that, you know, if you don't like it,
[02:22:38.960 --> 02:22:40.800]   anytime in the first 100 days you call 'em,
[02:22:40.800 --> 02:22:43.000]   they'll come and get it, they'll take it away.
[02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:45.200]   And refund every penny.
[02:22:45.200 --> 02:22:48.320]   It also, as you can see, it comes in a very compact box.
[02:22:48.320 --> 02:22:50.720]   That's a queen-sized mattress fit in the easy box.
[02:22:50.720 --> 02:22:51.560]   That's really great.
[02:22:51.560 --> 02:22:53.520]   It's why I got one from my son at college
[02:22:53.520 --> 02:22:55.760]   'cause it was very easy to get upstairs in the dorm room.
[02:22:55.760 --> 02:22:57.560]   And by the way, he really appreciated having
[02:22:57.560 --> 02:23:01.120]   a nice fresh mattress in the dorm room.
[02:23:01.120 --> 02:23:03.560]   And because they're inexpensive, it was a great thing.
[02:23:03.560 --> 02:23:05.280]   It was worth it for four years.
[02:23:05.280 --> 02:23:08.680]   We also, I sleep every night on my Casper pillow.
[02:23:08.680 --> 02:23:12.280]   Last night, I said, "Where's my Casper pillow?"
[02:23:12.280 --> 02:23:14.520]   Lisa said, "We were watching TV.
[02:23:14.520 --> 02:23:16.120]   "I have it in this couch."
[02:23:16.120 --> 02:23:18.880]   I got up out of bed, walked to the living room
[02:23:18.880 --> 02:23:22.200]   to get my Casper pillow 'cause I have to have it.
[02:23:22.200 --> 02:23:23.560]   It is the best.
[02:23:23.560 --> 02:23:27.120]   Dual layer, responsive, but comfortable, but cool.
[02:23:27.120 --> 02:23:28.000]   And by the way, that's another thing.
[02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:29.320]   I love the coolness.
[02:23:29.320 --> 02:23:31.560]   I think, and I think, Georgie, you can friend this,
[02:23:31.560 --> 02:23:33.240]   that one of the problems people have with sleeping
[02:23:33.240 --> 02:23:34.400]   is they get too hot.
[02:23:34.400 --> 02:23:35.800]   You need to stay cool.
[02:23:35.800 --> 02:23:38.800]   And these mattresses breathe beautiful.
[02:23:38.800 --> 02:23:39.960]   - And they're so comfortable.
[02:23:39.960 --> 02:23:41.400]   - Oh, you know.
[02:23:41.400 --> 02:23:42.760]   I do, I do.
[02:23:42.760 --> 02:23:45.520]   We, I've even jumped on a Casper mattress test.
[02:23:45.520 --> 02:23:46.360]   (laughing)
[02:23:46.360 --> 02:23:48.480]   Two years ago, they have great spring
[02:23:48.480 --> 02:23:50.720]   and you do want something to be cool underneath you
[02:23:50.720 --> 02:23:52.720]   and they're gonna sleep better
[02:23:52.720 --> 02:23:55.880]   if you have a nice cool dark cave.
[02:23:55.880 --> 02:23:57.360]   - Ooh, cool dark cave.
[02:23:57.360 --> 02:23:58.680]   Sounds good.
[02:23:58.680 --> 02:23:59.920]   Get your Casper right now.

[02:24:15.320 --> 02:24:19.640]   on the best mattress you will ever have from Casper.
[02:24:19.640 --> 02:24:22.840]   - Couple of final stories as we wrap up a twit
[02:24:22.840 --> 02:24:24.720]   for this week.
[02:24:24.720 --> 02:24:28.240]   James Comey, the director of the FBI,
[02:24:28.240 --> 02:24:31.640]   in an off-handed comment during a Q&A session
[02:24:31.640 --> 02:24:34.240]   at a speech at Kenyon College,
[02:24:34.240 --> 02:24:38.860]   admitted he puts tape over his webcam.
[02:24:40.240 --> 02:24:42.760]   The director of the FBI is worried about
[02:24:42.760 --> 02:24:45.360]   somebody spying on him.
[02:24:45.360 --> 02:24:47.760]   - I think the amazing part about this
[02:24:47.760 --> 02:24:49.360]   is not that he does it,
[02:24:49.360 --> 02:24:51.440]   but his excuse for doing it
[02:24:51.440 --> 02:24:53.480]   is because he saw other people doing it.
[02:24:53.480 --> 02:24:55.320]   - He saw some guy.
[02:24:55.320 --> 02:24:56.160]   - Yeah.
[02:24:56.160 --> 02:24:58.600]   - He says I saw something in the news, so I copied it.
[02:24:58.600 --> 02:25:01.480]   I put a piece of tape over the camera
[02:25:01.480 --> 02:25:04.360]   because I saw somebody smarter than I am
[02:25:04.360 --> 02:25:08.400]   had a piece of tape over their camera.
[02:25:09.240 --> 02:25:13.320]   - I don't know what even what this means.
[02:25:13.320 --> 02:25:14.760]   It's just, it's mind-boggling.
[02:25:14.760 --> 02:25:16.800]   Hey Greg, unplug and re-plug your headset
[02:25:16.800 --> 02:25:18.440]   and the show's gone on long enough now
[02:25:18.440 --> 02:25:20.720]   that we've fried your,
[02:25:20.720 --> 02:25:22.960]   there's some memory leak in the chip
[02:25:22.960 --> 02:25:23.880]   in some of these headsets.
[02:25:23.880 --> 02:25:24.720]   I don't know what it is.
[02:25:24.720 --> 02:25:25.880]   - Yeah, I'm sorry, I apologize.
[02:25:25.880 --> 02:25:26.720]   - No, it's better.
[02:25:26.720 --> 02:25:27.720]   No, it's not your fault.
[02:25:27.720 --> 02:25:29.800]   Man, don't blame yourself.
[02:25:29.800 --> 02:25:31.040]   It's USB.
[02:25:31.040 --> 02:25:32.880]   - 30.
[02:25:32.880 --> 02:25:34.120]   - WordPress.com right on,
[02:25:34.120 --> 02:25:38.640]   HTTPS encryption turned on for all of its websites.
[02:25:38.640 --> 02:25:41.560]   If you host your site on WordPress.com,
[02:25:41.560 --> 02:25:44.000]   that is a great thing.
[02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:46.760]   You don't have to do anything, it's just there, it's on.
[02:25:46.760 --> 02:25:48.720]   I think you might have to check a box
[02:25:48.720 --> 02:25:50.240]   and they're using Let's Encrypt,
[02:25:50.240 --> 02:25:53.760]   which is a really cool project for that anybody
[02:25:53.760 --> 02:25:56.400]   who's running their own website should look into
[02:25:56.400 --> 02:25:58.560]   that will get you an SSL certificate free.
[02:25:58.560 --> 02:26:00.280]   And a lot-
[02:26:00.280 --> 02:26:01.120]   - It's a easy service.
[02:26:01.120 --> 02:26:01.960]   - Isn't it great?
[02:26:01.960 --> 02:26:02.800]   And Let's Encrypt.
[02:26:02.800 --> 02:26:05.600]   - It works, I'm trying to do it on my Mac.
[02:26:05.600 --> 02:26:07.280]   Maybe I can get you to Greg to consult.
[02:26:07.280 --> 02:26:10.400]   It comes with these scripts, which is great.
[02:26:10.400 --> 02:26:12.320]   So it's really an automated process.
[02:26:12.320 --> 02:26:15.680]   And if you're using Apache, boom, bada, ding, bada, boom,
[02:26:15.680 --> 02:26:17.880]   it's very easy.
[02:26:17.880 --> 02:26:19.240]   If you're using Nginx,
[02:26:19.240 --> 02:26:21.560]   it'll be harder.
[02:26:21.560 --> 02:26:25.120]   And apparently on a Mac, it's like very sketch.
[02:26:25.120 --> 02:26:28.360]   But for most people who are running Apache on a LAMP stack,
[02:26:28.360 --> 02:26:32.520]   this is a very easy way to get a free cert and BHTTPS.
[02:26:33.480 --> 02:26:34.960]   - So the people who are involved in Let's Encrypt
[02:26:34.960 --> 02:26:36.400]   jumped onto Apache very early,
[02:26:36.400 --> 02:26:38.760]   because that's the most widely used server.
[02:26:38.760 --> 02:26:40.760]   But Nginx is a little bit behind it,
[02:26:40.760 --> 02:26:43.160]   but there's quite a few articles out there now
[02:26:43.160 --> 02:26:44.760]   on how to use your favorite tool.
[02:26:44.760 --> 02:26:45.600]   - Oh good.
[02:26:45.600 --> 02:26:49.080]   - So the key there of course is that your Let's Encrypt
[02:26:49.080 --> 02:26:51.200]   own the issues of certificate for 90 days.
[02:26:51.200 --> 02:26:54.080]   It does that of course to ensure,
[02:26:54.080 --> 02:26:56.760]   so that certificate validation
[02:26:56.760 --> 02:26:59.320]   or that certificate revocation is not required.
[02:26:59.320 --> 02:27:02.320]   So you have to refresh the certificate every 90 days.
[02:27:02.320 --> 02:27:04.160]   So that requires you to automate it
[02:27:04.160 --> 02:27:05.600]   and that requires you to have a script
[02:27:05.600 --> 02:27:06.480]   that automatically runs.
[02:27:06.480 --> 02:27:07.760]   So Apache does that,
[02:27:07.760 --> 02:27:09.640]   and now there are tools available
[02:27:09.640 --> 02:27:11.720]   more and more of the web servers as Let's Encrypt
[02:27:11.720 --> 02:27:14.200]   becomes so obviously dominant in the market.
[02:27:14.200 --> 02:27:15.960]   - So you could just kind of have a cron job
[02:27:15.960 --> 02:27:18.400]   that every three months gets a new cert.
[02:27:18.400 --> 02:27:21.040]   - Indeed, and then you also have in the cron job
[02:27:21.040 --> 02:27:23.400]   validations to check that the certificate's updated
[02:27:23.400 --> 02:27:26.200]   and then merge you with the whole range of things.
[02:27:26.200 --> 02:27:28.400]   But all of those things are happening, yes, Let's Encrypt.
[02:27:28.400 --> 02:27:29.360]   Fantastic project.
[02:27:29.360 --> 02:27:31.040]   And more importantly, Let's Encrypt is supported
[02:27:31.040 --> 02:27:33.120]   by a number of commercial companies.
[02:27:33.120 --> 02:27:35.760]   And we should thank them for contributing money
[02:27:35.760 --> 02:27:36.960]   to push that project. - Absolutely.
[02:27:36.960 --> 02:27:38.720]   Including WordPress.
[02:27:38.720 --> 02:27:40.600]   - Yes, let's just go. - Mozilla.
[02:27:40.600 --> 02:27:42.440]   - Mozilla, yeah. - Like companies
[02:27:42.440 --> 02:27:44.160]   who actually have big money
[02:27:44.160 --> 02:27:46.760]   are actually supporting this project.
[02:27:46.760 --> 02:27:48.360]   - They announced about a month ago
[02:27:48.360 --> 02:27:53.360]   that they had issued one million certs so far.
[02:27:53.360 --> 02:27:55.000]   That's awesome. - Well, that 90 day thing
[02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:57.360]   I talked about is going to drive a lot of data.
[02:27:57.360 --> 02:27:58.520]   - Yeah.
[02:27:58.520 --> 02:28:00.560]   - We're going to see an awful lot of certificates issued.
[02:28:00.560 --> 02:28:01.800]   They're going to have staggering numbers.
[02:28:01.800 --> 02:28:04.440]   - Yeah, they're doing 100,000 certificates a week.
[02:28:04.440 --> 02:28:09.880]   OVH WordPress.com, Gandy, Dreamhost, and DigitalOcean
[02:28:09.880 --> 02:28:12.640]   also support HTTPS using Let's Encrypt.
[02:28:12.640 --> 02:28:14.880]   So that's fantastic.
[02:28:14.880 --> 02:28:18.400]   Did you see, and what do you think of the Brave browser?
[02:28:18.400 --> 02:28:19.680]   Speaking of Mozilla, Brendan Eich,
[02:28:19.680 --> 02:28:20.680]   who is the founder of Mozilla,
[02:28:20.680 --> 02:28:22.560]   one of the founders of Mozilla,
[02:28:22.560 --> 02:28:25.720]   has created a new browser called Brave.
[02:28:25.720 --> 02:28:29.520]   It's nice, but it does something
[02:28:29.520 --> 02:28:32.280]   that, well, the newspaper publishers
[02:28:32.280 --> 02:28:33.960]   aren't real happy about.
[02:28:33.960 --> 02:28:37.560]   It comes with not only with a built-in ad blocker,
[02:28:37.560 --> 02:28:42.560]   but it replaces the third party ads
[02:28:42.560 --> 02:28:45.040]   with ads from its own inventory,
[02:28:45.040 --> 02:28:47.520]   ads from advertisers who don't use tracking,
[02:28:47.520 --> 02:28:52.800]   and honor the do not track setting.
[02:28:52.800 --> 02:28:56.920]   Then Brave takes a little bit, takes a taste,
[02:28:56.920 --> 02:28:59.840]   and then shares the rest of the revenue with publishers
[02:28:59.840 --> 02:29:01.600]   and users, and they say on better terms
[02:29:01.600 --> 02:29:04.280]   than the publishers are getting from their own ad networks.
[02:29:04.280 --> 02:29:07.360]   That's not good enough for the newspaper publishers
[02:29:07.360 --> 02:29:12.080]   of America, 17 members called Brave Blatenly Illegal.
[02:29:12.080 --> 02:29:15.320]   Blatenly Illegal.
[02:29:15.320 --> 02:29:17.160]   I'll explain why that's not true,
[02:29:17.160 --> 02:29:20.920]   and a plan to steal content and threaten a lawsuit.
[02:29:20.920 --> 02:29:24.400]   Eich responded, I think, with something
[02:29:24.400 --> 02:29:29.120]   probably worth mentioning, which is browsers,
[02:29:29.120 --> 02:29:31.320]   and I'm reading directly from his post,
[02:29:31.320 --> 02:29:34.400]   do not just playback recorded pixels
[02:29:34.400 --> 02:29:36.040]   from the publisher's sites.
[02:29:36.040 --> 02:29:38.840]   They're the end user agent,
[02:29:38.840 --> 02:29:41.240]   the software you run on your computer
[02:29:41.240 --> 02:29:44.560]   that mediates and combines all those little bits of content,
[02:29:44.560 --> 02:29:47.440]   including ads and news stories,
[02:29:47.440 --> 02:29:49.440]   and displays them on your screen.
[02:29:49.440 --> 02:29:53.760]   Content is published as documents, HTML markup,
[02:29:53.760 --> 02:29:56.880]   with the intent not of specifying how the content is presented,
[02:29:56.880 --> 02:29:59.440]   the browsers are free and do, in fact,
[02:29:59.440 --> 02:30:01.280]   rearrange, ignore, mash up,
[02:30:01.280 --> 02:30:02.800]   and otherwise make use of content
[02:30:02.800 --> 02:30:05.840]   from any source to deliver that page to you on the screen.
[02:30:05.840 --> 02:30:08.520]   If it were the case, he said,
[02:30:08.520 --> 02:30:11.280]   that Brave's browsers perform "republication"
[02:30:11.280 --> 02:30:13.440]   as the newspapers suggest, then,
[02:30:13.440 --> 02:30:15.880]   well, then, so does Safari's reader mode,
[02:30:15.880 --> 02:30:17.720]   or any browser with an ad blocker,
[02:30:17.720 --> 02:30:21.720]   or I don't know, do you use links on your command line?
[02:30:21.720 --> 02:30:23.240]   That does it, too.
[02:30:23.240 --> 02:30:27.080]   So do screen readers for blind users?
[02:30:27.080 --> 02:30:28.720]   That's what a browser does.
[02:30:28.720 --> 02:30:31.280]   A browser's software you run,
[02:30:31.280 --> 02:30:34.360]   that your request goes out and fetches content from sites
[02:30:34.360 --> 02:30:37.160]   and displays it however you, gosh darn, want it.
[02:30:37.160 --> 02:30:40.240]   Disagree, agree?
[02:30:40.240 --> 02:30:41.280]   - No, not at all.
[02:30:41.280 --> 02:30:44.760]   I think you have yet another proof
[02:30:44.760 --> 02:30:49.320]   that media companies are technology illiterate.
[02:30:49.320 --> 02:30:54.040]   They have not been able to keep up with technology
[02:30:54.040 --> 02:30:58.360]   and are actually unable to understand
[02:30:58.360 --> 02:31:00.080]   the reality of the world today.
[02:31:00.080 --> 02:31:02.760]   I think you look at why Facebook
[02:31:02.760 --> 02:31:06.000]   and Google control their destiny
[02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:08.840]   is because they were not paying attention
[02:31:08.840 --> 02:31:11.480]   to the bigger, you know, transit play.
[02:31:11.480 --> 02:31:16.120]   I think that is where media has fallen, you know?
[02:31:16.120 --> 02:31:19.000]   And I think, you know, this is just another example of it.
[02:31:19.000 --> 02:31:22.920]   It's like, you know, look, did you read the story on Forbes?
[02:31:22.920 --> 02:31:23.760]   Where?
[02:31:23.760 --> 02:31:26.560]   - Perfect example.
[02:31:26.560 --> 02:31:28.720]   - Yeah, like they're spreading malware.
[02:31:28.720 --> 02:31:31.320]   - So let me just, this is a great one.
[02:31:31.320 --> 02:31:34.480]   So Forbes, when you go to Forbes.com with an ad blocker on,
[02:31:34.480 --> 02:31:37.120]   it says, oh, this is how we make money,
[02:31:37.120 --> 02:31:39.680]   please turn off your ad blocker.
[02:31:39.680 --> 02:31:42.280]   I don't know Forbes, a lot of sites are now doing this,
[02:31:42.280 --> 02:31:44.760]   or you can't read the site.
[02:31:44.760 --> 02:31:48.000]   Does Forbes let you in, or does it just beg you to turn off?
[02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:49.800]   - No, it doesn't, it won't let you in.
[02:31:49.800 --> 02:31:52.920]   So you go, oh, well, I guess I have to turn off my ad blocker.
[02:31:52.920 --> 02:31:53.880]   And then what happens?
[02:31:53.880 --> 02:31:58.320]   Well, Forbes ad tech software allows automated purchase
[02:31:58.320 --> 02:32:01.600]   of banner ads and, oh, lo and behold,
[02:32:01.600 --> 02:32:04.360]   malware has been injected in your computer
[02:32:04.360 --> 02:32:09.400]   from an automated ad, a flash ad on the Forbes site,
[02:32:09.400 --> 02:32:10.480]   the irony.
[02:32:10.480 --> 02:32:16.400]   - You know, the editor of Forbes.com
[02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:22.000]   wrote a long piece defending Forbes after I went after them
[02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:27.080]   on Twitter, and my comment was something like,
[02:32:27.080 --> 02:32:30.280]   friends don't let Forbes use more stuff.
[02:32:30.280 --> 02:32:31.120]   - So Forbes.
[02:32:31.120 --> 02:32:34.720]   - And it was, and I used to work before--
[02:32:34.720 --> 02:32:38.440]   - Forbes was a good content.
[02:32:38.440 --> 02:32:39.800]   - Whatever, like whatever.
[02:32:39.800 --> 02:32:42.760]   I'm not gonna talk about the merits of the content.
[02:32:42.760 --> 02:32:46.520]   I think the fact that they were spreading malware
[02:32:46.520 --> 02:32:48.160]   was on them, right?
[02:32:48.160 --> 02:32:52.400]   That's something, and he wrote a long,
[02:32:52.400 --> 02:32:56.040]   I can almost 2000 word piece defending
[02:32:56.040 --> 02:32:58.240]   why I was wrong and Forbes was right.
[02:32:58.240 --> 02:33:00.640]   Well, lo and behold, they're doing this again.
[02:33:00.640 --> 02:33:03.760]   And, you know, like kind of, it's the same thing,
[02:33:03.760 --> 02:33:06.280]   you know, economists did, which was like
[02:33:06.280 --> 02:33:08.360]   accidentally served up malware.
[02:33:08.360 --> 02:33:11.360]   And, you know, it's like, if you're going to take advertising,
[02:33:11.360 --> 02:33:16.000]   if you're gonna make advertising your key source of income,
[02:33:16.000 --> 02:33:19.880]   at least, you know, be careful to pay attention
[02:33:19.880 --> 02:33:23.440]   to the fact that it could damage your end customers.
[02:33:23.440 --> 02:33:26.520]   Also your end customers, not just advertisers,
[02:33:26.520 --> 02:33:27.560]   but also the readers.
[02:33:27.560 --> 02:33:32.440]   So, you know, I think media had it coming
[02:33:32.440 --> 02:33:34.000]   for them in my opinion.
[02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:35.000]   - It really is a shame.
[02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:38.440]   - I think the part that really upsets me about the Forbes thing
[02:33:38.440 --> 02:33:41.920]   is that as soon as the malware appear, they go,
[02:33:41.920 --> 02:33:43.360]   oh, it's not our responsibility,
[02:33:43.360 --> 02:33:46.320]   it's our third party ad tech suppliers.
[02:33:46.320 --> 02:33:48.440]   But it's your brand that's actually at play here.
[02:33:48.440 --> 02:33:50.360]   And I was, at home is exactly right.
[02:33:50.360 --> 02:33:53.560]   Not only are media companies, tech companies,
[02:33:53.560 --> 02:33:57.000]   every company is a tech company in 2016.
[02:33:57.000 --> 02:33:58.920]   And the companies that are failing are the ones
[02:33:58.920 --> 02:34:02.720]   who don't understand that IT and the technology that drives it
[02:34:02.720 --> 02:34:04.600]   is your key competitive advantage,
[02:34:04.600 --> 02:34:08.080]   or it's your survival mechanism as it gets,
[02:34:08.080 --> 02:34:11.080]   as the industry changes, as technology changes, everything.
[02:34:11.080 --> 02:34:13.080]   And media companies are just one example of that.
[02:34:13.080 --> 02:34:16.360]   I mean, look at their rush to get onto the platform of medium.
[02:34:16.360 --> 02:34:19.120]   Now, medium's able to even talk about becoming
[02:34:19.120 --> 02:34:21.720]   a publishing platform for the old media companies
[02:34:21.720 --> 02:34:23.960]   because they don't wanna be technology companies.
[02:34:23.960 --> 02:34:25.960]   They don't want to understand the internet.
[02:34:25.960 --> 02:34:27.600]   They don't want to understand ad tech.
[02:34:27.600 --> 02:34:31.000]   They don't wanna hire developers and write platforms.
[02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:34.680]   And yet you look at the media companies who are successful,
[02:34:34.680 --> 02:34:37.680]   and they're the ones who have invested heavily in IT teams
[02:34:37.680 --> 02:34:40.920]   in technology people hiring the right resources
[02:34:40.920 --> 02:34:44.800]   and in spending on technology and so forth.
[02:34:44.800 --> 02:34:45.760]   They're the ones that are winning,
[02:34:45.760 --> 02:34:48.520]   and the ones that are failing the companies like Forbes
[02:34:48.520 --> 02:34:50.520]   who say, "Oh, we're not a technology company,
[02:34:50.520 --> 02:34:52.480]   we're just about content."
[02:34:52.480 --> 02:34:55.160]   And even earlier today we talked about Yahoo
[02:34:55.160 --> 02:34:58.000]   is selling itself to Verizon, or what's Verizon?
[02:34:58.000 --> 02:34:59.000]   A technology company.
[02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:00.240]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[02:35:00.240 --> 02:35:01.760]   It's like newspaper publishers
[02:35:01.760 --> 02:35:03.880]   and networks, they're the dinosaurs in the room.
[02:35:03.880 --> 02:35:07.840]   Like they have to evolve with the way of things or die off.
[02:35:07.840 --> 02:35:10.520]   And so they really have to get with the way
[02:35:10.520 --> 02:35:13.280]   that things are changing and understanding that.
[02:35:13.280 --> 02:35:18.280]   - So I wanna end the show with a hat tip to robots
[02:35:18.280 --> 02:35:22.720]   and automated technology.
[02:35:22.720 --> 02:35:26.920]   Couple of great upbeat stories.
[02:35:26.920 --> 02:35:31.760]   Here are trucks, which have crossed,
[02:35:31.760 --> 02:35:34.840]   what is it, all of Europe I think, autonomously.
[02:35:34.840 --> 02:35:38.360]   Or not exactly, they have one truck with a driver in front
[02:35:38.360 --> 02:35:42.960]   who has Wi-Fi, and he led a convoy of trucks
[02:35:42.960 --> 02:35:48.920]   across Europe with no drivers in the back, just him.
[02:35:48.920 --> 02:35:51.640]   - I know, they all had drivers.
[02:35:51.640 --> 02:35:53.360]   - They had drivers, oh, that's no fun,
[02:35:53.360 --> 02:35:55.680]   but they couldn't touch the wheel.
[02:35:55.680 --> 02:35:57.840]   - There are, the drivers would,
[02:35:57.840 --> 02:35:59.480]   where it had to be there for safety.
[02:35:59.480 --> 02:36:00.320]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:36:00.320 --> 02:36:02.720]   - But it was basically when they're on the highway,
[02:36:02.720 --> 02:36:06.640]   the trucks are able to use the white lines on the road
[02:36:06.640 --> 02:36:09.480]   to steer themselves and to reach the optimal condition.
[02:36:09.480 --> 02:36:12.280]   So because they see how the video is,
[02:36:12.280 --> 02:36:15.480]   drafting each other and saving up to 20% of emissions
[02:36:15.480 --> 02:36:19.040]   and fuel, and that's all done by computer.
[02:36:19.040 --> 02:36:20.840]   The drive is actually just sitting there resting it.
[02:36:20.840 --> 02:36:23.320]   Can only run on a motorway,
[02:36:23.320 --> 02:36:25.560]   and only if the motorway is in good condition
[02:36:25.560 --> 02:36:27.760]   with perfect white lines to operate.
[02:36:27.760 --> 02:36:30.600]   - And please don't get in between the trucks.
[02:36:30.600 --> 02:36:33.480]   'Cause they'll squish you.
[02:36:35.040 --> 02:36:36.760]   - I would hate to run into this convoy.
[02:36:36.760 --> 02:36:38.720]   How many trucks were it, three?
[02:36:38.720 --> 02:36:41.040]   - Well, there was four different manufacturers
[02:36:41.040 --> 02:36:42.800]   in the article it talks about,
[02:36:42.800 --> 02:36:45.240]   and they all had a competition to drive across.
[02:36:45.240 --> 02:36:46.240]   - Oh, okay.
[02:36:46.240 --> 02:36:50.440]   - It's not like Google's car or any of this other stuff.
[02:36:50.440 --> 02:36:53.520]   They're fully manned, the self-drive mode
[02:36:53.520 --> 02:36:54.760]   only works on the highway.
[02:36:54.760 --> 02:36:56.480]   It's more like cruise control.
[02:36:56.480 --> 02:36:59.040]   - Yeah, but there's always some Italian and a Fiat
[02:36:59.040 --> 02:37:00.160]   who has to get in between.
[02:37:00.160 --> 02:37:01.880]   I don't know why that is.
[02:37:01.880 --> 02:37:04.240]   Get out of the way.
[02:37:04.240 --> 02:37:06.360]   - Yeah, six times.
[02:37:06.360 --> 02:37:08.040]   - Okay, that's story number one.
[02:37:08.040 --> 02:37:12.000]   The other good news story comes, of course, from SpaceX,
[02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:15.000]   which did it for the first time they were able to.
[02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:17.400]   They launched, of course, the Dragon
[02:37:17.400 --> 02:37:21.720]   to bring 7,000 pounds of cargo to the space station.
[02:37:21.720 --> 02:37:23.480]   And what SpaceX has been trying to do
[02:37:23.480 --> 02:37:27.120]   is get these boosters back after they're used up,
[02:37:27.120 --> 02:37:32.120]   and they were able to land the booster upright on a barge.
[02:37:33.360 --> 02:37:36.360]   Same music, oddly enough, as the trucks.
[02:37:36.360 --> 02:37:38.400]   (laughing)
[02:37:38.400 --> 02:37:39.760]   No, maybe that tab's still open.
[02:37:39.760 --> 02:37:42.000]   And there it is.
[02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:46.160]   The robots are winning, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:37:46.160 --> 02:37:47.760]   Hey, it was so much fun.
[02:37:47.760 --> 02:37:49.880]   I took an extra 40 minutes of your time.
[02:37:49.880 --> 02:37:51.520]   I thank you for being so generous.
[02:37:51.520 --> 02:37:53.440]   Om Malek from Om.co.
[02:37:53.440 --> 02:37:58.440]   You are the greatest @Om, the best Twitter handle ever.
[02:37:58.440 --> 02:38:00.840]   Should I say Om or Om?
[02:38:00.840 --> 02:38:01.840]   - You were doing it right.
[02:38:01.840 --> 02:38:02.680]   - Oh.
[02:38:02.680 --> 02:38:04.360]   - I like Om, 'cause it's like my mantra.
[02:38:04.360 --> 02:38:05.600]   You are my mantra.
[02:38:05.600 --> 02:38:07.240]   - Mm-hmm.
[02:38:07.240 --> 02:38:09.040]   - When I think of you when I'm in a table.
[02:38:09.040 --> 02:38:10.920]   (laughing)
[02:38:10.920 --> 02:38:12.640]   A happy little Om.
[02:38:12.640 --> 02:38:13.640]   Hey, it's great to have you.
[02:38:13.640 --> 02:38:15.120]   Great, always a pleasure to see you.
[02:38:15.120 --> 02:38:15.960]   - Thank you.
[02:38:15.960 --> 02:38:17.880]   - Thank you for joining us.
[02:38:17.880 --> 02:38:22.880]   Thanks also to the wonderful Georgia and her videos.
[02:38:22.880 --> 02:38:25.000]   We've got a sure to, Georgia Dazz videos
[02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:30.000]   at anxiety.anxiety-videos.com.
[02:38:30.240 --> 02:38:34.960]   Videos now on parenting, on of course anxiety
[02:38:34.960 --> 02:38:37.440]   and on getting a better nights sleep.
[02:38:37.440 --> 02:38:40.800]   And Georgia and her partner do these
[02:38:40.800 --> 02:38:43.400]   and she is a trained professional.
[02:38:43.400 --> 02:38:45.080]   So don't try this at home.
[02:38:45.080 --> 02:38:46.800]   Oh no, do try this at home.
[02:38:46.800 --> 02:38:49.360]   Do try this at home, right?
[02:38:49.360 --> 02:38:50.200]   - Yes.
[02:38:50.200 --> 02:38:51.040]   - Yes.
[02:38:51.040 --> 02:38:51.880]   - Yeah.
[02:38:51.880 --> 02:38:54.360]   - And do you know when you're getting your vibe?
[02:38:54.360 --> 02:38:55.480]   - June.
[02:38:55.480 --> 02:38:56.320]   - Oh man.
[02:38:56.320 --> 02:38:57.440]   - It's way too long.
[02:38:57.440 --> 02:38:58.280]   It's way too long.
[02:38:58.280 --> 02:39:00.040]   - I've actually written to them to say like,
[02:39:00.040 --> 02:39:03.560]   please can you send, I'll do a review on it, I'll mention.
[02:39:03.560 --> 02:39:05.080]   - I did the same thing.
[02:39:05.080 --> 02:39:05.920]   - I did you?
[02:39:05.920 --> 02:39:07.440]   - Yeah, well I did it to Oculus.
[02:39:07.440 --> 02:39:10.120]   I said we wanna open it, we wanna, and they said no.
[02:39:10.120 --> 02:39:10.960]   - Did it work?
[02:39:10.960 --> 02:39:11.960]   - No, they said no.
[02:39:11.960 --> 02:39:13.840]   - They said no to me as well.
[02:39:13.840 --> 02:39:14.680]   - They said no?
[02:39:14.680 --> 02:39:15.520]   - I was like, sorry.
[02:39:15.520 --> 02:39:16.360]   - Yeah, I said no.
[02:39:16.360 --> 02:39:17.600]   - You'll get it when you get it.
[02:39:17.600 --> 02:39:19.400]   - Exactly, I was very sad.
[02:39:19.400 --> 02:39:23.000]   - I should have said I know Georgia Dow,
[02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:24.160]   maybe that would have helped.
[02:39:24.160 --> 02:39:25.600]   - I don't know, I think they would have,
[02:39:25.600 --> 02:39:26.960]   they would have sent it even later.
[02:39:26.960 --> 02:39:28.880]   (laughing)
[02:39:28.880 --> 02:39:32.080]   - I think Elon Musk is doing with my Tesla by the way.
[02:39:32.080 --> 02:39:33.480]   - Oh no, no.
[02:39:33.480 --> 02:39:36.440]   - Yeah, I ordered a Tesla X, you know,
[02:39:36.440 --> 02:39:37.440]   the one with the,
[02:39:37.440 --> 02:39:38.280]   - Mm hmm.
[02:39:38.280 --> 02:39:40.040]   - And the doors.
[02:39:40.040 --> 02:39:42.720]   And I think the doors actually do kind of like that,
[02:39:42.720 --> 02:39:45.240]   they don't close, but I.
[02:39:45.240 --> 02:39:46.840]   - Don't say that, it's not another thing.
[02:39:46.840 --> 02:39:49.160]   - Oh no, I'm sorry, I love you, Elon, I love you.
[02:39:49.160 --> 02:39:53.080]   God, you landed the spacecraft straight up and down.
[02:39:53.080 --> 02:39:54.840]   - So awesome, Falcon 9.
[02:39:54.840 --> 02:39:57.760]   - He said, you know, they posted a post saying,
[02:39:57.760 --> 02:39:59.120]   we're sorry about the Model X,
[02:39:59.120 --> 02:40:01.000]   I think it was, they called it hubris,
[02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:05.480]   they tried to do too much with the Model X technology.
[02:40:05.480 --> 02:40:08.000]   And anyway, I got a VIN number like 800,
[02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:09.560]   like a really low one, right?
[02:40:09.560 --> 02:40:10.400]   - Wow.
[02:40:10.400 --> 02:40:12.120]   - But one would think they've made 800 by now,
[02:40:12.120 --> 02:40:15.160]   he says they have, not mine apparently.
[02:40:15.160 --> 02:40:18.120]   - Have you told them that you'll talk about it on the show?
[02:40:18.120 --> 02:40:19.880]   - No, I think they don't want me to talk about it.
[02:40:19.880 --> 02:40:21.280]   (laughing)
[02:40:21.280 --> 02:40:26.280]   Honestly, there's a little tag on my file
[02:40:26.280 --> 02:40:28.240]   that says, don't tell Leo anything,
[02:40:28.240 --> 02:40:30.720]   'cause he'll just alert it out on his podcast.
[02:40:30.720 --> 02:40:33.240]   I swear, 'cause nothing.
[02:40:33.240 --> 02:40:35.320]   I'll get it when I get it.
[02:40:35.320 --> 02:40:36.880]   - Any advertising is good advertising.
[02:40:36.880 --> 02:40:39.880]   - I'll get it when I get it, and I'll be happy.
[02:40:39.880 --> 02:40:42.400]   Greg Farrow is our newest victim,
[02:40:42.400 --> 02:40:45.880]   and you are great, Greg, you come back soon, okay?
[02:40:45.880 --> 02:40:48.920]   - I can't wait, Leo, it's been a fantastic opportunity
[02:40:48.920 --> 02:40:50.680]   and I've really enjoyed myself.
[02:40:50.680 --> 02:40:53.320]   - How long is packet pushers typically?
[02:40:53.320 --> 02:40:58.720]   - It varies anywhere from 30 to minutes to two hours.
[02:40:58.720 --> 02:41:00.520]   - Oh, good, okay, good.
[02:41:00.520 --> 02:41:02.240]   All right.
[02:41:02.240 --> 02:41:03.320]   - Because we're covering technology,
[02:41:03.320 --> 02:41:05.000]   we talk about it until it's dead.
[02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:06.640]   - Yeah, that's pretty much the show.
[02:41:06.640 --> 02:41:09.120]   - Yeah, sometimes it's, yeah.
[02:41:09.120 --> 02:41:09.960]   - It killed.
[02:41:09.960 --> 02:41:11.400]   - Sometimes there's only a little bit to talk about,
[02:41:11.400 --> 02:41:13.240]   and sometimes you can just keep waffling on
[02:41:13.240 --> 02:41:14.680]   for hours and hours and hours.
[02:41:14.680 --> 02:41:16.280]   We do put out multiple shows a week,
[02:41:16.280 --> 02:41:18.280]   so we do put out five shows a week.
[02:41:18.280 --> 02:41:20.800]   You're a punter, you're twice that.
[02:41:20.800 --> 02:41:23.080]   (laughing)
[02:41:23.080 --> 02:41:24.360]   - There's twice that in one day.
[02:41:24.360 --> 02:41:25.200]   - In one day!
[02:41:25.200 --> 02:41:29.240]   - Everybody go to pixelpushers.net
[02:41:29.240 --> 02:41:30.320]   to hear more of Greg.
[02:41:30.320 --> 02:41:32.960]   - Our problem of course is they just don't have enough
[02:41:32.960 --> 02:41:35.480]   advertisers, that's why otherwise we'd have more content.
[02:41:35.480 --> 02:41:37.360]   - We're gonna get you more advertisers.
[02:41:37.360 --> 02:41:40.040]   I think you're talking to Lisa about that, right?
[02:41:40.040 --> 02:41:40.880]   - We are.
[02:41:40.880 --> 02:41:41.720]   - Good.
[02:41:41.720 --> 02:41:43.160]   - We're delivering something today.
[02:41:43.160 --> 02:41:44.840]   - Good, see?
[02:41:44.840 --> 02:41:46.360]   See, we're gonna work this out.
[02:41:47.360 --> 02:41:48.760]   - Thank you all for being here.
[02:41:48.760 --> 02:41:52.280]   Thanks to our live studio audience, you've been very patient.
[02:41:52.280 --> 02:41:54.280]   Not one of them went to the bathroom the whole time.
[02:41:54.280 --> 02:41:55.360]   It's amazing.
[02:41:55.360 --> 02:41:57.960]   You can be in the live studio audience,
[02:41:57.960 --> 02:41:59.720]   and by the way, bathroom breaks are allowed.
[02:41:59.720 --> 02:42:01.960]   If you just email tickets@twit.tv,
[02:42:01.960 --> 02:42:05.080]   we'll make sure we get a chair set out for you.
[02:42:05.080 --> 02:42:07.280]   There's even a young lady in the audience
[02:42:07.280 --> 02:42:08.720]   who's been very patient.
[02:42:08.720 --> 02:42:12.160]   Good job, nice job.
[02:42:12.160 --> 02:42:13.600]   She's a budding geek,
[02:42:13.600 --> 02:42:16.120]   and I say that with love in my heart.
[02:42:16.120 --> 02:42:20.360]   If you wanna watch live, you can do it every Saturday,
[02:42:20.360 --> 02:42:23.640]   I'm sorry, Sunday afternoon, 3PM Pacific, 6PM Eastern time,

[02:42:25.760 --> 02:42:27.560]   But you can also get on to Matt Audio and video.

[02:42:30.800 --> 02:42:33.560]   I don't even even know what the URL.
[02:42:33.560 --> 02:42:35.760]   Just go to Twit.tv and click the shows button.

[02:42:41.720 --> 02:42:46.720]   Roku, iOS, Android, Windows, Phone, and more.

[02:42:52.840 --> 02:42:55.840]   Another Twit is in the can, bye bye.
[02:42:55.840 --> 02:42:58.420]   (upbeat music)
[02:42:58.420 --> 02:42:59.680]   (clapping)
[02:42:59.680 --> 02:43:02.260]   (upbeat music)
[02:43:02.260 --> 02:43:04.840]   (upbeat music)
[02:43:04.840 --> 02:43:06.680]   Doin' the twit, baby.
[02:43:06.680 --> 02:43:08.680]   Doin' the twit, alright.
