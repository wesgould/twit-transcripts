[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.080]   And a great panel all in studio today,
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.720]   which is a lot of fun, my old friend from Tech TV,
[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.400]   David Prager, is here.
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.800]   Now the host of Speed It Up Joe.
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:09.880]   It's a little bit slow.
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.200]   No, that's called a stort.
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.200]   Yep.
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.360]   It's a show where you take things
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.680]   and you play them back in various--
[00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:17.680]   Change the name of that.
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:18.520]   It usually involves--
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.360]   Just speed it up, John.
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.200]   It's a little--
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.040]   A much better name.
[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.360]   --enboard, just go through.
[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.520]   Slow motion destruction.
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.840]   And sometimes, most of it is--
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.600]   The more interesting stuff is when you blow stuff up
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:28.600]   and destroy things.
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.440]   And then we'll try to explain what's technically happening
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.640]   to provide some technical cred or some geek cred.
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.240]   Were you there when Fufu and Rose used Thermite
[00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.080]   to blow up that PC in Kevin's backyard
[00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.400]   and almost burnt the whole name?
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.200]   Yeah, and we-- yeah.
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.160]   Yeah, I remember that we had a mushroom cloud out the back--
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.600]   in his backyard.
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.680]   I wish you'd had that in super slow-mo.
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:49.880]   And I think that was shot--
[00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.720]   No, it was shot, host 9/11.
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.560]   But anytime you're doing these stuff,
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.160]   they have to worry that people are--
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.080]   Watching, looking.
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.480]   --winking up to more than no good.
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.200]   I think that was pre-known.
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:58.700]   You're not.
[00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.000]   I don't think you would have done that after that.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.200]   No, I think that was done in 2003.
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.200]   Hey, look who else is here?
[00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.080]   Ryan Block, newly minted millionaire, former owner of Gadget.
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.480]   Well, you sold it to AOL.
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.480]   Yeah, it was a long time ago.
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:11.000]   Actually, citrusy.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.440]   I've been on the show since that happened.
[00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:13.320]   Oh, I know.
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.720]   I just--
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.400]   I've just ribbon you.
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.040]   Now, product director-- what are you--
[00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.840]   VP product?
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:19.360]   What do you do?
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.440]   It says right there, VP product AOL.
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.240]   Yeah.
[00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.440]   So Gadget got sold to AOL.
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.800]   It was kind of funny because you'd left an AOL and a gadget
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:29.920]   to found it.
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:30.960]   Was that always the planner?
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:31.520]   Was it just--
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.760]   Yeah, no, I'm just going to keep creating your companies
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:34.960]   and then keep talking about that.
[00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.360]   Hey, all right, look what I did.
[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.880]   Yes.
[00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:37.400]   It's beautiful.
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.880]   Exactly.
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:38.760]   I'll just call it.
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.440]   No, I mean, it fit.
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:42.120]   It made sense.
[00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.840]   No, that's great.
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:43.520]   Yeah.
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:44.320]   We chose them.
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.800]   And then we were talking about for the show,
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.800]   you're now overseeing product development for AOL,
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:50.320]   which is cool.
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:51.400]   That sounds like a fun job.
[00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.760]   Yeah, yeah, we're kind of somewhere in the close out.
[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.280]   Are they working on a watch?
[00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.360]   Fortunately for me, no physical items
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:58.680]   because those are very hard to produce.
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:59.160]   Yeah.
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.520]   Yes.
[00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:00.440]   It's a real challenge.
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.840]   Anyway, it's great to have you.
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.160]   Also here.
[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.040]   And she asked not to be seated anywhere near Ryan.
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.360]   So--
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.280]   No, just kidding.
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.800]   It's Veronica Belma.
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:09.300]   Yay.
[00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:10.080]   I'm not my friend.
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.200]   Host of "Texzilla," former host of a little show
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.040]   called "Game On."
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:14.920]   Too soon.
[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:15.760]   Late lamented.
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:16.440]   Too soon.
[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.960]   Sad.
[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:19.800]   And Aussie misses you.
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:20.320]   Oh.
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.680]   He sent me a note to tell you that.
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:22.920]   Why is he not here today?
[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.040]   If I had known you were going to be here,
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.240]   I would have brought Aussie.
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.440]   You don't know that I'm going to be here?
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:27.160]   Actually, I did know.
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.320]   He left the wine out for me.
[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.320]   I did.
[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:30.160]   Where is the wine?
[00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:30.160]   I don't know.
[00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.160]   You drank it all already?
[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:31.680]   No, wait a minute.
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:32.600]   Here's the glasses.
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.200]   Would you like a glass of wine?
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.360]   Well, I wasn't going to, but why not?
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.960]   You don't want to dust these off beforehand.
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.280]   And we're drinking a fine, crooked vine,
[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.680]   from Livermore Valley, which is not really known for its wine.
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.160]   So the big story of the week.
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.160]   Steve Ballmer decides to throw in the towel or--
[00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.720]   and let me ask you this.
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.080]   Let's see a show of hands.
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.920]   Was he fired or did he quit?
[00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:58.880]   Or does it matter?
[00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.440]   I think he was ready to go.
[00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:01.600]   You think the board though said--
[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:02.200]   I don't think so.
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.280]   Steve, he's 57.
[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:05.800]   Personally, I don't think so.
[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.920]   I think he's been there for 13 years as CEO.
[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:10.120]   And then since the beginning.
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.120]   Yeah, he was Bill Gates' roommate at Harvard.
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.720]   I don't think it has to be either or.
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:15.680]   I think it can be both.
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.280]   He was quit-fired.
[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.200]   Fire-quitted.
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:19.400]   Fire-quitted.
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:19.960]   It was time.
[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.320]   It was clearly time.
[00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:21.800]   He knew it.
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:22.720]   They knew it.
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:23.880]   That's probably-- I mean, no big--
[00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:24.880]   I don't think anybody has--
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:25.480]   How was that?
[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:26.480]   Forever.
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:27.040]   And the last--
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:27.520]   Myself included.
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:28.320]   Yeah.
[00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.440]   And then the last quarterly report, Microsoft
[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:34.520]   had to take a $900 million charge for Surface RT,
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.240]   that after $1 billion charge for the Xbox Red Ring of Death.
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.160]   And over to a $1 billion charge.
[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.440]   He's not been a great CEO.
[00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:45.280]   He's kind of kept the ship roughly on course.
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.800]   I mean, they started out with a huge product, of course,
[00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:48.760]   that being Windows.
[00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.600]   And they were doing very well in that area.
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.160]   And then they've come out with a lot of different products
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:52.520]   over the years.
[00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:53.760]   He inherited that.
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.200]   And so that has continued to be the money maker for them.
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.800]   And they've come out with a lot of different products
[00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.000]   and a lot of different things over the years.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   Windows and Office.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.840]   You know, Microsoft was a big hit.
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.960]   There were some forays into the phone world,
[00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.280]   like the kin, for example.
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:08.120]   Yeah, that was a success.
[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:09.440]   And then Surface tablet.
[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.400]   So there's been some highs and some lows.
[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:12.160]   Oh, slow lows.
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:13.240]   But the problem is they haven't--
[00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:13.720]   One thing.
[00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:17.600]   Name one thing bomber did that you could say this was a hit.
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.640]   I think the only thing that really had been during his tenure
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:21.720]   that was really a hit was Xbox.
[00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:22.680]   But that wasn't really even--
[00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:23.640]   That was JL or it wasn't it?
[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.640]   Yeah, but that wasn't really his thing.
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:27.360]   Robbie Bach.
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:32.960]   Yeah, well, Xbox-- I mean, so he allowed Xbox to exist in the way
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.040]   that made it possible for it to become what it is, which
[00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:38.880]   is they allowed them to take the Xbox and turn it
[00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.520]   into kind of an independent division within the company,
[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.840]   the entertainment and devices division.
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:45.800]   And that was what it required and needed
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.680]   to be outside the box at Microsoft in order
[00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:49.720]   to become successful.
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:53.000]   If it was a product of Microsoft's normal process,
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.960]   it would never be able to compete in the video game market.
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.400]   And so that's why it's the exception.
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:59.760]   It's something very different there.
[00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:02.640]   And yeah, they took a write down on the red ring of death,
[00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:03.440]   but that's done now.
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.360]   And now they're the most successful video game console
[00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:05.880]   in the market.
[00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:08.840]   And they're making a ton of money.
[00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:09.560]   Bringing that up.
[00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:12.920]   This is the biggest hit Steve Bomber ever had.
[00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:14.840]   Chasing a cake at CES.
[00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:15.320]   That's it.
[00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:18.480]   We now know this is his story of his--
[00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.720]   And I just think that makes me think that he developed--
[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:22.840]   They developed developers, developers, developers, developers.
[00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:24.200]   You know, I got to praise him for that,
[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:26.240]   because that's the thing that I think he did that was most
[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:27.880]   interesting and most atypical of a CEO,
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.000]   is he was enthusiastic.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:30.840]   What's wrong with that?
[00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:34.080]   But there's a difference between enthusiastic and crazed,
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:36.520]   like, rabbit, like, unhinged.
[00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:38.080]   I think that was his way, though.
[00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:38.760]   I think that is--
[00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:41.480]   The thing is he comes off unhinged.
[00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:44.560]   And I actually-- I got privy to an internal Microsoft video
[00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:47.520]   a couple of years back that it was never--
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:49.480]   it's never been released to the internet.
[00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:52.880]   And I saw it, and it was an internal all hands.
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:55.000]   And it was a developers, developers, developers,
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.200]   like moment.
[00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:58.280]   And he was totally unhinged.
[00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:00.520]   I mean, I could not believe that this man is running anything.
[00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:02.760]   Like, even a household is crazy.
[00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:03.320]   Oh, OK.
[00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:04.600]   We don't have to get, like, personal--
[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:05.560]   No, but I'm just saying.
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:07.880]   Like, he is really--
[00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:10.640]   Was he Microsoft's crazy uncle?
[00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:11.200]   I think so.
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:13.120]   Oh, I've often called you my crazy uncle.
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:13.720]   Oh, thank you.
[00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:16.360]   Well, I've run around saying developers.
[00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:17.840]   He-- remember that one moment?
[00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:19.800]   It-- Seattle at the Superdome, where
[00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:22.000]   there was a guy in the front row who had an iPhone,
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.280]   and he took it, and he put it on the stage and stomped on it.
[00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:25.960]   Well, he actually fixed it.
[00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:28.680]   He put it down, but he made like, oh, and then he, like,
[00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:29.480]   kind of, fixed on--
[00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:30.880]   And he didn't actually--
[00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:32.400]   Yeah, he didn't actually destroy it.
[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:33.760]   Which is kind of even more sad.
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:35.920]   I mean, if you're going to do that, just actually stomp
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:36.520]   on your thing.
[00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:38.120]   But I could afford to give him a new one.
[00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:40.320]   What I was trying to say earlier is that there hasn't been--
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:42.360]   I mean, there's been innovation, but there hasn't been
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:44.640]   a lot of crazy outside of the box thinking
[00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:45.920]   in Microsoft's part in the last--
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:47.000]   And they kind of need it right now.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   --12 years.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.400]   And so they kind of need it.
[00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:50.840]   But what worries me is that it's still
[00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:52.320]   the same board of directors.
[00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:54.400]   So-- and Balmer's still going to be on board with them
[00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:57.160]   while they go through this process of finding a new CEO.
[00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:58.440]   So it doesn't give me a lot of hope
[00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:02.120]   that there's going to be a huge shift in direction for them
[00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:03.320]   going on this current path.
[00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:05.200]   Isn't the problem, really, that Microsoft
[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:07.280]   is at the end of the line in general?
[00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:09.560]   It's very difficult to take a company like that
[00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:12.320]   and reinvent it, retool it to live in the new--
[00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:13.320]   Well, yeah.
[00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:14.320]   Well, yeah.
[00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:15.320]   What about it?
[00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:16.320]   What a success.
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:18.320]   There were a company that was kind of on a decline,
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:20.320]   and now they've brought in some major new talents
[00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:21.320]   to change the direction of the company.
[00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:23.320]   But they still have a tough time defining
[00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:24.320]   what it is that they do.
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.320]   Like, I don't-- I'm sure there's a mission statement
[00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:28.320]   that's put somewhere, but I don't think anybody
[00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:29.320]   knows what--
[00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:30.320]   Juries out on Yahoo!
[00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:31.320]   Well, you know, it could be a success, but it might not be.
[00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.320]   Throughout their whole process of finding their new CEO,
[00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:35.320]   they were trying to decide if they were going to be a media
[00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:37.320]   company or if they were going to be a product company.
[00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:38.320]   They never decided on--
[00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:39.320]   --a web product company.
[00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:40.320]   And they haven't, but they're leaning more on the side
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:44.320]   of the product because Merzamair is not a media person.
[00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:46.320]   Have you been to Yahoo! lately?
[00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:49.320]   Do you know that they have a Google toolbar at the top of Yahoo?
[00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:52.320]   I mean, it doesn't say Google, but they've duplicated the Google
[00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:53.320]   bar.
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:54.320]   Go to the top there.
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:57.320]   If you scroll up, Chad, see that?
[00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:59.320]   It's the Google bar.
[00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:02.320]   It says home, mail, sports, and this is on the--
[00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:04.320]   If you go to Flickr, it's on Flickr.
[00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:05.320]   It's on the--
[00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:07.320]   I think Marissa's innovation is staying--
[00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:08.320]   [laughter]
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:10.320]   --is staying in stuff that she did at Google.
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:11.320]   --whereation works.
[00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:12.320]   --and applying it to Yahoo!
[00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:13.320]   Anyway, I don't want to get that.
[00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:14.320]   That's a separate conversation.
[00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:16.320]   --search to Microsoft.
[00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:17.320]   Yeah, they were doing long-term research.
[00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:18.320]   I don't know what--
[00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:19.320]   Anyway.
[00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:20.320]   That's a little part what you did before.
[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:21.320]   Well, in any event, I think--
[00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:24.320]   Look, the problem with Balmer is that he is not a product guy.
[00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:25.320]   He doesn't understand product.
[00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:28.320]   He doesn't know a good product if it dropped out of the sky and
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:29.320]   hit him.
[00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:32.320]   And this is why the surface and the can and all these different
[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:33.320]   things were allowed to exist.
[00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:36.320]   And they existed right alongside the Xbox, actually genuinely
[00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:38.320]   good products with great strategies.
[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:41.320]   So they need somebody who understands what people want.
[00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:44.320]   If they can get that, if that is the only thing that changes,
[00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:47.320]   and the board stays the same, Balmer's still on the board
[00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:50.320]   and Bill's still on the board, and the only thing that changes
[00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:53.320]   is they get a product CEO, they will be in such better shape.
[00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:56.320]   But I think it's more than someone who understands what people
[00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:57.320]   want.
[00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:58.320]   I think that's one step.
[00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:00.320]   And then the other step is to understand what can be developed
[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:02.320]   that people don't even realize that they want.
[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:04.320]   That's the really, really, really hard part to--
[00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:05.320]   Right.
[00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:06.320]   That's like--
[00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:07.320]   Yeah, that's one step.
[00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:08.320]   That's the way back to the Steve Jobs thing.
[00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:09.320]   Here's a tablet.
[00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:10.320]   People are like, I don't need a tablet.
[00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:11.320]   And guess what?
[00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:13.320]   Now, it's like the largest growing market in the mobile
[00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:16.320]   computing space, which is not even the mobile computing
[00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:17.320]   space.
[00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:18.320]   It's just the computing space.
[00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:19.320]   But from day one, that's all Microsoft ever has done is
[00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:20.320]   imitate others.
[00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:21.320]   Catch up.
[00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:22.320]   Play and catch up.
[00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:23.320]   Even Windows was imitating the Mac.
[00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:25.320]   Well, they bought an OS.
[00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:26.320]   Oh, they--no, they licensed it.
[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:27.320]   See, Apple and DOS.
[00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:28.320]   Yeah.
[00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:29.320]   Was MS DOS.
[00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:32.320]   But you also have to stay ahead of the game.
[00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:34.320]   I don't think anyone realized what the cloud was going to be
[00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:36.320]  --they just-- Microsoft didn't realize it.
[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:38.320]   Everyone knows now because it seems it's so ubiquitous.
[00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:39.320]   It's done.
[00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:40.320]   That's what's going on.
[00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:43.320]   But like, you know, Google didn't need to create office--
[00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:45.320]   an office suite per se the way Microsoft did.
[00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:48.320]   They just created something that works online and is an office
[00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:49.320]   suite.
[00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:50.320]   Well, I was trying to Google.
[00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:51.320]   I was actually acquired Google Docs.
[00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:52.320]   Yeah.
[00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:53.320]   Google Docs.
[00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:54.320]   Google Docs.
[00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:55.320]   Yeah.
[00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:57.320]   But they're very strategic and they buy things that they actually
[00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:00.320]   see a future in and they are more often than not right.
[00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:01.320]   Right?
[00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:02.320]   Google Maps.
[00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:03.320]   Another good example.
[00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:08.320]   Microsoft's problem is that they actually do--I think their R&D side
[00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:09.320]   is massive.
[00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:11.320]   They test all kinds of crazy ideas.
[00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:13.320]   Ideas that are so crazy that they shouldn't even be testing
[00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:14.320]   them because they're--
[00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:15.320]   Like the courier.
[00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:16.320]   Which was a good interesting idea.
[00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:17.320]   Well, no, that's not even one of--
[00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:18.320]   That's not even one of--
[00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:19.320]   That is not--
[00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:20.320]   That was the full open tablet.
[00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:21.320]   That might have been interesting.
[00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:22.320]   Oh, actually, yeah.
[00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:24.320]   They didn't actually green like that.
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:27.320]   The Microsoft R&D group does all kinds of crazy stuff.
[00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:29.320]   But they don't actually productize any of it.
[00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:33.320]   And so what they wind up with is a very watered down milk toast
[00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:37.320]   version of their R&D products that come out before their time,
[00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:40.320]   but not quite ready for the market.
[00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:41.320]   And then they miss.
[00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:42.320]   And they miss every single time.
[00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:44.320]   And it's such a simple pattern to watch happen.
[00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:48.320]   They need, as David said, they need a product guy-- well, I said
[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:49.320]   they need a product guy.
[00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:52.320]   But he said the new product guy who understands what people
[00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:54.320]   want when they don't even know they want that thing yet.
[00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:55.320]   That's the key here.
[00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:56.320]   But there's little nuances.
[00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:57.320]   Like when they--
[00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:58.320]   The Microsoft Surface.
[00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:00.320]   And the first time anyone saw that, I think most people are like,
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:02.320]   wow, that's amazing the way that you can manipulate what you're
[00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:03.320]   seeing.
[00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:05.320]   And then they announced that right after Apple's iPad announced.
[00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:06.320]   No, I thought they didn't--
[00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:07.320]   No, yes.
[00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:08.320]   Apple announced as the iPad.
[00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:09.320]   The Surface was the--
[00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:10.320]   We've got a big-ass table.
[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:12.320]   I think the table was out there before the iPad.
[00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:13.320]   Oh, the table, not the tablet.
[00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:14.320]   The big-ass table I'm talking about.
[00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:15.320]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:16.320]   The original Surface.
[00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:17.320]   That's what I mean.
[00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:18.320]   Yeah.
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:19.320]   That was out before the announcement of the iPad.
[00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:20.320]   This was a labs project.
[00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:21.320]   Apple said we're going to do the iPad.
[00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:24.320]   And Microsoft said, unless I'm completely wrong, jack,
[00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:29.320]   we'll fix me.
[00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:30.320]   Yeah, watch for your direction.
[00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:31.320]   The table comes first.
[00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:32.320]   I don't think so.
[00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:34.320]   I think that maybe the iPhone came first.
[00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:35.320]   The touch came out from Apple.
[00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:38.320]   I'm pretty sure it was the iPhone, not the iPad.
[00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:41.320]   And as soon as they announced the iPhone, Microsoft said, well,
[00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:44.320]   we've got Surface in the lab, which they probably did beforehand.
[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:47.320]   And that would have been cool to see more of if they had something.
[00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:48.320]   2008, right.
[00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:50.320]   So the iPhone had come out in 2007, 2008, the Surface.
[00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:51.320]   I liked the Surface table.
[00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:52.320]   I thought it was awesome.
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:54.320]   Yeah, but there was no product there.
[00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:55.320]   There was no there.
[00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:57.320]   Well, in Japan, you can order food off of your table.
[00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:58.320]   And it's awesome.
[00:13:58.320 --> 00:13:59.320]   I want to do that here.
[00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:00.320]   Is it a Surface?
[00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:01.320]   It's not a Surface.
[00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:02.320]   It's a different technology.
[00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:05.320]   You see Surface in Vegas, at hotels, on cruise ships,
[00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:06.320]   there was some Surface.
[00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:09.320]   And if you've ever played with it, it doesn't work so good.
[00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:12.320]   It's a neat idea that's just not, okay, what do we got here?
[00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:13.320]   History.
[00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:14.320]   It's great.
[00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:16.320]   Like you've got the real product.
[00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:18.320]   The idea for the product was second.
[00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:19.320]   It conceived in 2001.
[00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:21.320]   Yes, of course.
[00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:29.320]   It predates, and this was Microsoft's point, was they didn't announce it until 2008 after
[00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:31.320]   they saw the Windows phone.
[00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:34.320]   They had to say, oh, wait, we've been since 2001.
[00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:37.320]   You know, they were doing tablets since 2001 too, by the way.
[00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:38.320]   Yeah.
[00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:39.320]   Very publicly.
[00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:42.320]   Well, it seems to me that some have said this is the case.
[00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:44.320]   The problem with Microsoft is structural.
[00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:45.320]   That you have --
[00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:46.320]   It's culture.
[00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:47.320]   It's culture.
[00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:54.320]   It's less wood, fewer arrows, and, you know, wet companies like Google are moving towards,
[00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:55.320]   and Apple is always doing that.
[00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:57.320]   Saying no to the right product.
[00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:58.320]   More wood, fewer arrows.
[00:14:58.320 --> 00:14:59.320]   Yeah.
[00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:00.320]   Yeah, I got it.
[00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:01.320]   It's picking the right things.
[00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:02.320]   Yeah.
[00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:03.320]   They don't say no.
[00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:04.320]   They say yes to everything.
[00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:05.320]   Right.
[00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:06.320]   And if you have --
[00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:07.320]   None of it's very good.
[00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:11.920]   The Fiefdoms, like Office, that are powerful, and say to other products -- I think the career
[00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:12.920]   was an example.
[00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:16.320]   You can't do that because it will eat out our core product, and they kill --
[00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:20.320]   And they kill products because of this, you know, infighting.
[00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:22.320]   It would be nice to see them take some more chances.
[00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:26.320]   So what Bombers said is that we're going to become a device in services business.
[00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:29.320]   We're going to get -- you know, we're moving away from PCs.
[00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:33.320]   We're going to do devices like Surface, and we're going to do services like Azure.
[00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:35.320]   The transition is going to happen.
[00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:36.320]   It's going to take longer than I can be here.
[00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:37.320]   I'm 57.
[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:41.320]   So I want somebody in now who can take that through all the way.
[00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:43.320]   Mary Jofoli of Windows Weekly got to talk --
[00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:45.320]   I'm going to talk to you all about Microsoft.com.
[00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:47.320]   Got to talk with Bombers the day of his announcement.
[00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:49.320]   She said, "What's your biggest regret?"
[00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:52.320]   He says, "Oh, you know, I've actually had a --" He was, by the way, very folksy with her.
[00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:53.320]   It's kind of an interesting interview.
[00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:58.320]   I've actually had a chance to make a lot of mistakes, and probably because, you know, people
[00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:00.320]   all want to focus on period A, period B.
[00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:04.320]   But I would say probably the thing I regret most is the -- what shall I call it?
[00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:06.320]   The Lupiti Lou.
[00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:07.320]   [ Laughter ]
[00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:09.320]   But you kind of love him, right?
[00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:10.320]   He's hilarious.
[00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:11.320]   He's a spooky.
[00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:14.320]   The Lupiti Lou we did that was sort of Longhorn de Vista.
[00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:17.680]   Now, it's funny because that mistake while people were paying attention and the business
[00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:20.320]   knew about it was not a public mistake.
[00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:24.200]   Microsoft had announced Longhorn, its next generation of Windows, and, you know, a year
[00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:27.320]   or two into the project said, "Oops, we can't do it, so we're going to rewrite everything
[00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:28.320]   from scratch."
[00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:30.320]   Then Vista came out, which was a public failure.
[00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:31.320]   He's not talking about that.
[00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:35.320]   He's talking about the failure of Longhorn, as if anybody even knew that happened.
[00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:38.320]   Well, it must have been a lot of internal strikes.
[00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:43.320]   Internal must have been nightmarish.
[00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:44.320]   I think he was fired.
[00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:49.320]   I think the nail in the coffin was the $900 million write-off for Surface RT.
[00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:55.320]   I think it became a very apparent to the board that Windows 8 had failed and that Bomber
[00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:58.320]   was leading the company in no particular direction.
[00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:02.320]   They said, "We need to have somebody in here who at least can make an effort at this."
[00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:06.320]   By the way, Bomber made more money that day than he has in his whole career.
[00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:08.320]   He was talking about $100 million.
[00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:09.320]   Like another billion dollars?
[00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:11.320]   Seven percent jump in his stock value.
[00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:15.320]   Yeah, almost a billion dollars just for quitting.
[00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:19.320]   Well, because people are excited that maybe a billion like Microsoft, it's kind of like,
[00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:24.320]   you know, you can fire, even if he say he was an amazing CEO, sometimes he could be a good
[00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:28.320]   CEO of another company and a sports team might fire a coach who's good, but they just need
[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:29.320]   to hit the reset button.
[00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:33.320]   I mean, with a lot of strategy, so it's going to be really tough for them to, you know,
[00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:37.320]   there's a lot of talented people, but for them to find a CEO that's worthy of writing the
[00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:41.320]   ship and there's a lot less work that needs to be done there, I think than at Yahoo, I think.
[00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:47.320]   But, you know, it's a huge task to find someone who's both a savvy businessman and an extreme
[00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:51.320]   product visionary because you don't always need the CEO to be the visionary, but at a company
[00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:53.320]   like Microsoft, I think it requires that kind of a visionary.
[00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:54.320]   Or businesswoman.
[00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:55.320]   Or businesswoman.
[00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:56.320]   A good point.
[00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:57.320]   Let's get a woman in there.
[00:17:57.320 --> 00:17:58.320]   I mean, it's going to be-
[00:17:58.320 --> 00:17:59.320]   Well, I was going to volunteer.
[00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:00.320]   Pretty cool to see.
[00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:02.320]   It could be really neat to see who comes in next.
[00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:05.320]   And then, you know, do they really turn this thing around?
[00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:06.320]   And they turn that ship.
[00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:09.320]   To your point, you bring me in Marissa Meyer was a bit of a-
[00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:11.320]   Someone said Jerry Yang.
[00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:12.320]   Yeah.
[00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:15.320]   Bring me in Marissa Meyer at Yahoo was a bit of a surprise, but turned out to be a very
[00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:16.320]   smart move.
[00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:17.320]   Yeah.
[00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:20.320]   At the very least, because it told developers, "Hey, we're going to bring in somebody that
[00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:21.320]   you will want to work for."
[00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:22.320]   And change the whole culture.
[00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:23.320]   Change the culture.
[00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:24.320]   Completely.
[00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:27.320]   And I think that's the kind of, you know, injection of kick-ass that Microsoft needs right
[00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:28.320]   now.
[00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:31.320]   Mary Jofoli asked, "Bolmer, did Bill Gates ask you to stay or go?
[00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:32.320]   No," says Balmer.
[00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:34.320]   Bill, I mean, no.
[00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:35.320]   No.
[00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:36.320]   No.
[00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:37.320]   No.
[00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:39.320]   Bill, I don't know what the- I wish we could hear the audio.
[00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:41.320]   But anyway, Bill- I'm reading the transcript.
[00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:42.320]   Bill respects my decision.
[00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:47.320]   I mean, it's one of those things when, if it's, you know, ultimately these kinds of things
[00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:49.320]   have to be one's own personal decision.
[00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:53.320]   In other words, Bill did not try to talk me out of this, right?
[00:18:53.320 --> 00:19:00.320]   So at the very least, the board didn't say, "Oh, please, Bill, Steve, please stick around."
[00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:01.320]   Well, yeah.
[00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:02.320]   And how could they, right?
[00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:05.880]   I mean, if you look at their stock price over the last 10 plus years, it's flat.
[00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:10.480]   And flat means down because your stock has to rise at least with inflation in order to
[00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:12.240]   be keeping the dollars level.
[00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:15.760]   So, you know, he- it was time.
[00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:17.280]   It's time, I think.
[00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:19.640]   Like I said before, the board knew it.
[00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:21.120]   He probably knew it.
[00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:22.520]   It's the right moment.
[00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:23.520]   I agree.
[00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:24.520]   It's the right moment.
[00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:25.520]   It's the past due.
[00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:26.960]   Let's not drag this out any longer.
[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:29.680]   So who do you hire?
[00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:30.680]   I don't know.
[00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:31.680]   Maybe Jay?
[00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:32.680]   Jay Allen.
[00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:33.680]   Maybe Robbie Brock.
[00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:37.920]   So both those guys did not get along well together at all.
[00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:38.920]   It's not both.
[00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:39.920]   It's one of the other.
[00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:41.840]   I would love to see Jay Allard in there.
[00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:42.840]   That'd be pretty cool.
[00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:46.240]   Jay Allard is the guy who convinced Bill to bet big on the Internet.
[00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:49.760]   And then he was the guy who convinced Bill to bet on the Xbox.
[00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:53.080]   So what do you- do you need somebody like that who can- who's a visionary or do you
[00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:55.760]   need somebody who can kick some ass?
[00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:56.760]   Both?
[00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:57.760]   I don't think they're mutually specific.
[00:19:57.760 --> 00:19:58.760]   Yeah, they can be- that can be both.
[00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:01.680]   And he's clearly an effective operator.
[00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:02.680]   You think so?
[00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:03.680]   Yeah.
[00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:05.680]   I think so.
[00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:08.920]   It probably does need to be somebody who understands the Microsoft culture.
[00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:11.920]   It's not going to be- and I don't know who's available.
[00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:12.920]   Paul Adeen is available.
[00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:14.920]   Paul Adeen is available.
[00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:15.920]   Paul Adeen is available.
[00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:16.920]   Yeah.
[00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:17.920]   She's not working right now.
[00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:21.520]   I would say for whatever it's worth, I met Ballmer a few times.
[00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:22.520]   He's- Tim Tebow.
[00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:24.000]   As crazy as he is.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   Thanks, John.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.800]   He's also a really nice guy.
[00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:27.800]   He sounds like a nice guy.
[00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:29.520]   He is a really, really nice guy.
[00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:30.520]   He's super friendly.
[00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:31.520]   He's really warm.
[00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:34.600]   He's just also happens to be totally crazy.
[00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:35.600]   I'm-
[00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:36.600]   The best ones are.
[00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:37.600]   Yeah.
[00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:39.160]   I mean, I don't know.
[00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:40.160]   Elon Musk.
[00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:42.160]   I mean, different crazy.
[00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:43.160]   He's got a nice movie.
[00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:45.160]   He's got different kinds of crazy.
[00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:47.520]   Elon Musk is crazy in a very different way than Ballmer.
[00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:49.800]   He's a Tesla in SpaceX 3 so he can build the Hyperloop.
[00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:50.800]   Yeah.
[00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:53.880]   Because he said if- he's not going to do it but he said in five years if no one's doing
[00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:54.880]   it.
[00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:58.160]   And maybe I'll have done enough of what I want to do with my other two companies that
[00:20:58.160 --> 00:20:59.680]   all focus on something like that.
[00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:00.680]   Well, good.
[00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:05.200]   Because I think I would love to take a ride that would scramble my brain on the way and
[00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:06.640]   descramble it on the other side.
[00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:09.280]   What kind of acceleration do you have to have to get to- what was it?
[00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:10.280]   700 miles an hour?
[00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:11.280]   Yeah, but-
[00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:13.080]   But it never goes above a half-cheek.
[00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:14.080]   Really?
[00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:15.080]   Yeah.
[00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:16.080]   I mean, you know, slow-
[00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:17.080]   They showed all the acceleration curves-
[00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:20.560]   Most of the time it's spent accelerating and decelerating probably.
[00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:21.560]   Depends.
[00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:24.680]   In Northern California, once you get to the Central Valley, then it's all kind of flat
[00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:25.680]   and even.
[00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:26.680]   Right.
[00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:27.680]   Yeah.
[00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:28.680]   That's when you speed up.
[00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:29.680]   Yeah, that's when you speed up.
[00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:30.680]   We're going to take a break.
[00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:34.440]   We got a good panel here and a good story.
[00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:36.760]   I think that Steve Bomber story is great the rest of us all downhill.
[00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:37.760]   So thanks for watching.
[00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:39.800]   We'll see you all next time.
[00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:42.520]   Our show- no, I'm not going to say that because we want you to stick around because
[00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:44.200]   we've got four ads to do.
[00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:45.680]   Our show is brought to you by-
[00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:48.720]   Hey, I'm honest.
[00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:50.520]   I'm the Steve Bomber of Twit.
[00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:51.920]   I don't know.
[00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:52.920]   Advertisers.
[00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:53.920]   Advertisers.
[00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:54.920]   What's that?
[00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:58.680]   He actually responded to his developers, developers, and said it's advertisers.
[00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:00.360]   Our show today brought to you by an advertiser.
[00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:02.080]   We love squarespace.com.
[00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:08.160]   Earlier today, I brought Google down on the radio show and I just wanted to tell Google
[00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:12.440]   you should probably go to Squarespace and ask them how they do it because you cannot
[00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:16.360]   bring- I was showing your set top box spreadsheet on Google Docs.
[00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:17.360]   Oh.
[00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:18.360]   I mentioned on the radio show.
[00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:22.400]   Now, admittedly, the radio show is in 200 stations and probably like a million people.
[00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:26.280]   If so, if maybe 20,000 people tried to all visit that spreadsheet, it probably would
[00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:27.280]   bring it down.
[00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:28.280]   I don't know.
[00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:29.280]   It did.
[00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:30.280]   Whatever happened.
[00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:31.280]   Maybe it was coincidence.
[00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:33.960]   But Google's CDN in Mountain View went down.
[00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:36.520]   So Squarespace, go ahead.
[00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:41.000]   Everybody go, let's say, to inside our blog, inside twit.tv, inside.twit.tv.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.560]   That's our Squarespace blog.
[00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:47.800]   If you all go there at once, all everybody watching, you can't bring it down.
[00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:54.360]   Squarespace is the best hosting plus the best content management system all mixed together
[00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:55.360]   into one.
[00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:58.320]   Now, I admit we haven't really taken advantage of the great Squarespace templates.
[00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:00.240]   There we got to update that.
[00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:01.520]   It's pretty straightforward.
[00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:05.280]   If you visit Squarespace.com, you'll see these new gorgeous new templates.
[00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:09.800]   Click the Get Started button and you'll get to select a template to start.
[00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:14.600]   They have designers working all the time to create new templates.
[00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:20.520]   The newest is Momentum, which is a full bleed, gorgeous website for a photographer, a designer
[00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:22.880]   who really wants the images to stand out.
[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:26.920]   But then if you scroll down, you'll see all the different customers using Momentum.
[00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:30.880]   And each one is unique and different, beautiful.
[00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:31.880]   Squarespace.com.
[00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:32.880]   Here's the deal.
[00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:33.880]   Go there.
[00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:34.880]   Right now, click the Get Started button.
[00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:35.880]   You got two weeks.
[00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:36.880]   Just mess with it.
[00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:38.320]   You can import data from your existing site.
[00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:40.240]   They support all the blog APIs.
[00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:41.240]   You can set it up.
[00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:42.240]   Play with the templates.
[00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:44.440]   The nice thing is templates are decoupled from the content.
[00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:48.720]   So you can try every template, one after the other, not, you know, it's just press a button
[00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:50.200]   that switches.
[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:52.800]   If you decide you want to stick around, I want you to try it.
[00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:53.800]   Great prices.
[00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:56.120]   It starts at $8 a month.
[00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:59.440]   The commerce is only $24 a month of the annual plan.
[00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:03.240]   When you get the annual plan, you do get some additional features, including free domain
[00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:05.160]   name and they'll hook it all up for you.
[00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:06.160]   Unlimited bandwidth.
[00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:07.200]   You'll never get a bandwidth bill either.
[00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:08.200]   I love that.
[00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:09.600]   Squarespace.com.
[00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:14.880]   And do tweet us with your Squarespace website so we can highlight.
[00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:16.120]   Soretenlaser.com.
[00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:17.120]   Are you using Soreten?
[00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:18.120]   There we go.
[00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:19.120]   Soretenlaser.
[00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:22.640]   So what you should do so that we'll mention it on Twitch is tweet it with the hashtag
[00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:24.320]   #TwitsSquarespace.
[00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:27.280]   And then maybe in a few weeks we'll take a look at Soretenlaser.com.
[00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:28.920]   Oh, I'll do it now.
[00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:29.920]   All right.
[00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:30.920]   Yeah.
[00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:33.680]   Did you do this yourself?
[00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:34.680]   I did, yes.
[00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:36.680]   That's fun.
[00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:38.680]   That's cool.
[00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:39.680]   Oh, wow.
[00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:40.680]   It's not too fast.
[00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:41.680]   We should just watch this show.
[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:43.680]   Yeah, just watch that show.
[00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:44.680]   I'm sorry.
[00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:48.920]   I got distracted by Soretenlaser.
[00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:49.920]   Here's one.
[00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:50.920]   Josh and Kristi.
[00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:53.520]   I think we showed this last week, Josh and Kristi.com.
[00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:54.760]   This is a wedding.
[00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:57.480]   Did you guys use Squarespace for your--
[00:24:57.480 --> 00:24:58.480]   Or a wedding page?
[00:24:58.480 --> 00:24:59.480]   Yeah, we did.
[00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:01.480]   I don't know if the site is still out there.
[00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:02.480]   I don't think it is.
[00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:03.480]   No, you don't need it anymore.
[00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:04.480]   You're married.
[00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:05.480]   That's true.
[00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:06.880]   Josh and Kristi did that, which is really sweet.
[00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:07.880]   Oh, that's sweet.
[00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:08.880]   I don't know.
[00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:10.120]   The wedding, the destination.
[00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:12.960]   The nice thing is, if you're going to get married and the whole thing's going to--
[00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:14.480]   you got two weeks free.
[00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:17.680]   So like, get engaged, get married within two weeks, go on the honeymoon and then you can
[00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:19.360]   let the site go and cost you nothing.
[00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:20.360]   Yes.
[00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:22.360]   That is actually-- I think exactly what happened.
[00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:23.360]   Is it?
[00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:24.360]   No, that's not true.
[00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:25.360]   Do you pay for it?
[00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:27.520]   You told me you went to a special wedding site.
[00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:28.520]   Oh, I was using--
[00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:29.520]   And it was sucky.
[00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:30.760]   Yeah, no, it wasn't sucky.
[00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:34.080]   I was using Britmorn's site, but I can't remember exactly what it was called, but it
[00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:36.960]   didn't have all the features that we needed for our site.
[00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:37.960]   So you went to Squarespace.
[00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:38.960]   So I went to Squarespace a week to see it.
[00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:39.960]   Two weeks later.
[00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:40.960]   Who cares?
[00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:41.960]   It's over.
[00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:42.960]   Totally.
[00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:43.960]   We're married.
[00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:44.960]   Don.
[00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:45.960]   Oh, look, their registry is still online.
[00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:46.960]   Josh and Kristi.com.
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:47.960]   Which we got them.
[00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:49.320]   Oh, I don't know.
[00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:51.680]   So how to game Squarespace for your wedding?
[00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:52.680]   That's awesome.
[00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:53.680]   Yeah.
[00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:54.680]   You know, I asked them once.
[00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:58.240]   You guys, because the wedding is so inexpensive and like, we can save that $15.
[00:25:58.240 --> 00:25:59.240]   That's true.
[00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:00.240]   That's a good point.
[00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:02.320]   It's not exactly a huge expense.
[00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:06.240]   Tweet a link with Twitch Squarespace and we will-- as the hashtag, we will look at it
[00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:07.240]   next week.
[00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:08.240]   Okay.
[00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:10.400]   Love to see some of those sites.
[00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:11.400]   Is this one?
[00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:14.000]   Here's Jojo in our chatroom, 1150short.com.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   He's a filmmaker.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   1150 SHORT.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   All right.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:20.480]   I would guess you're making short films.
[00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:21.480]   Oh, neat.
[00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:22.480]   See that?
[00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:23.480]   That's the same.
[00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:24.480]   That's the same--
[00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:26.840]   That's the same theme we used for our wedding site.
[00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:27.840]   You actually recognize it.
[00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:28.840]   Definitely.
[00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:31.280]   But you know what's cool is every site looks completely different.
[00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:34.080]   And that's one of the things I really like about Squarespace.
[00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:35.080]   It's 1150 short.
[00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:36.080]   That's great.
[00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:37.080]   That's great.
[00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:38.080]   Isn't that gorgeous?
[00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:39.080]   Squarespace.
[00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:40.680]   Give it a try today.
[00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:41.880]   Use our offer code when you buy.
[00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:43.240]   I didn't even mention this.
[00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:47.320]   Use our offer code TWIT8 and you'll save 10% off.
[00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:50.640]   If you get a yearly plan, that's a big savings on your new site.
[00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:53.760]   TWIT and the number eight for the month of August.
[00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:59.600]   Thank you, Jojo.
[00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:01.400]   Moving along.
[00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:03.200]   Is it your own coding or markup?
[00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:05.880]   I was asking him which site he's talking about.
[00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:09.040]   Because if it was Squarespace, I did that all myself.
[00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:13.840]   But if it was my personal site, I had someone do that.
[00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:15.560]   But you're also on Squarespace or your personal site?
[00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:19.080]   No, I use WordPress on my personal site.
[00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:20.440]   I think we've done enough on Microsoft.
[00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:22.440]   Shall we move along?
[00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:24.040]   Waze is starting to show up in Google Maps.
[00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:25.040]   That's pretty cool.
[00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:26.040]   Yay.
[00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:27.040]   Are you Waze users?
[00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:28.040]   Yes.
[00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:29.040]   Love Waze.
[00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:30.040]   Love Waze.
[00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:31.040]   But isn't it kind of janky?
[00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:32.040]   It's all janky.
[00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:33.040]   What do you mean janky?
[00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:36.480]   It's just like it does something so well.
[00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:38.480]   And then you type in a destination.
[00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:40.400]   You like to search for something?
[00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:41.600]   And it can't find it.
[00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:44.120]   But they're adding Google search to that now.
[00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:45.120]   I know.
[00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:46.120]   But I'm just saying like--
[00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:47.120]   It's gotten better.
[00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:48.120]   But you're right.
[00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:49.120]   And that's because they had the weirdest search.
[00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:51.600]   Like you were using Yelp and some other thing and some other thing.
[00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:53.120]   It's just like it's a little janky.
[00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:54.120]   But it got better right away.
[00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:55.120]   It's frayed around the edges.
[00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:58.320]   But as soon as Google bottom, I noticed that that search worked almost every time.
[00:27:58.320 --> 00:27:59.320]   Yeah.
[00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:01.280]   So they must have put the back, fixed the back end on that.
[00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:07.040]   They bought them in June for more than a billion dollars to keep them away from Apple and Facebook
[00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:08.520]   and everybody else who was recording.
[00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:10.840]   Actually, I think Waze already turned down Apple.
[00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:13.280]   Apple didn't want to spend enough money.
[00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:15.080]   And now we're starting to see the traffic alerts.
[00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:19.000]   But what's not in there is the ability to add a traffic alert in Google Maps.
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   Right?
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.600]   So you see that there was an accident, but you can't--
[00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:25.760]   In ways you can wave your hand over it and say, you know, there's a cop.
[00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:27.400]   Or the three-finger tap.
[00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:29.160]   You do that or the way.
[00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:30.680]   I do the three-finger tap.
[00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:32.400]   Yeah, you have to because the wave you wave all the time.
[00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:33.880]   And it's always asking me, what?
[00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:34.880]   What do you want?
[00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:35.880]   What's happening?
[00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:36.880]   What do you want?
[00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:37.880]   What?
[00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:39.720]   I love Waze, though.
[00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:42.720]   I'm actually kind of glad, though, that it's not in main Google Maps because I think so
[00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:48.520]   many people use Google Maps and it opens up-- people who use Google Maps are not used
[00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:52.640]   to using it the way that people who use Waze are used to using Waze.
[00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:57.280]   And sometimes when you cross the streams, you get wonkiness.
[00:28:57.280 --> 00:28:58.280]   Why Google?
[00:28:58.280 --> 00:28:59.960]   I'm glad not to have all that junk data.
[00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:04.240]   I think all that's integrated right now is the accident warnings and traffic.
[00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:07.800]   Well, and that makes Google Maps a lot better.
[00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:11.440]   Google's had a lot of difficulties with traffic in Google Maps over the years.
[00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:15.520]   Remember, they were shutting down the traffic data for a long time.
[00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:18.880]   And I guess they're bringing it back now with Waze because they have a better traffic
[00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:19.880]   data system.
[00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:21.880]   But they've had difficulties getting it right.
[00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:25.600]   Which is funny because it wasn't-- with a Garmin or TomTom that was using the Google
[00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:26.760]   Maps traffic API.
[00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:27.760]   A lot of companies.
[00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:28.760]   A lot of cool new companies.
[00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:29.760]   A lot of cool new cars.
[00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:30.760]   And it wasn't very good.
[00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:32.760]   So that kind of ruins the whole--
[00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:34.640]   You drive the Tesla, right?
[00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:35.640]   Both.
[00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:36.640]   Both Ryan and I do.
[00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:37.640]   You drive the Tesla, right?
[00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:38.640]   I'm pointing like this.
[00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:39.640]   You drive the Tesla, right?
[00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:41.440]   Does it have Google Earth Google Maps?
[00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:42.960]   It has Google Maps integrated.
[00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:47.480]   And what actually we were complaining about on the drive up here, that you can get the
[00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:50.800]   road sensor traffic data through onto the map in the car.
[00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:55.720]   But when you're doing drive time predictions, it won't add that to it.
[00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:59.320]   So if I open my phone and go to Google Maps and say, how long does it take to get from
[00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:02.040]   Petaluma to San Francisco based on the traffic?
[00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:05.040]   And the phone will say, it's going to take you over an hour.
[00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:07.880]   The Tesla would say, no, it'll take you 40 minutes.
[00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:11.320]   The reason why that is is because they use Google Maps, but they use their own actual
[00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:13.040]   navigation system.
[00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:16.280]   Meaning the actual drawing of the route and where are you going to go and how long is
[00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:17.280]   it going to take?
[00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:19.880]   And should you avoid this street and take that street?
[00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:22.160]   All that is done on the Tesla side and it sucks.
[00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:23.160]   It's bad.
[00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:25.160]   I think you should send the car back.
[00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:26.160]   I'm going to get rid of it.
[00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:27.360]   We'll just go to a burnout.
[00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:31.320]   The nice thing is it's a software update away for the most part.
[00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:33.120]   No, it's too long to wait.
[00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:35.320]   But I think it's cool.
[00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:36.320]   It's a fire.
[00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:40.720]   There's so many amazing features in ways and people don't want to have that as ways
[00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:41.720]   by itself.
[00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:45.480]   And I think the slow integration of the things that might enhance Google Maps is the smart
[00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:47.960]   way to do it because most of what people are talking about and seeing some of this
[00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:52.840]   is it's just they're trickling in small elements that they think will enhance it slowly.
[00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:56.600]   And so then hopefully that allows them to, as they start taking more of it, allows them
[00:30:56.600 --> 00:31:00.760]   to be smart about the implementation and also even seeing user feedback.
[00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:01.760]   Yeah.
[00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:04.080]   Yeah, people get used to it when it's in this little changes.
[00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:10.320]   And by the way, the way Street View is ending up in the ways map editor, which is really
[00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:11.320]   weird.
[00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:14.240]   But I guess that helps you do a better job of fixing the map if you can see where you
[00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:15.240]   are.
[00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:18.880]   Now, apparently the FTC is retroactively because the deal's already gone through reviewing
[00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:20.360]   the deal.
[00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:24.240]   And the FTC after the fact say, oh, give them the money back.
[00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:25.640]   It's not good.
[00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:26.640]   Awkward.
[00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:31.440]   Well, so normally when you do a deal like that, there's a kill fee or some kind of a
[00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:32.440]   fee associated.
[00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:37.240]   So yeah, so if the deal falls apart for whatever reason, then ways gets, you know, a couple
[00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:39.960]   hundred million bucks for their trouble.
[00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:43.320]   I don't know if they can, but I mean, I would imagine the FTC can do whatever the hell
[00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:44.680]   the FTC wants to do.
[00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:46.680]   Just put them all in jail.
[00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:47.680]   This is really an escalation.
[00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:48.680]   This is escalated quickly.
[00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:51.600]   Turn the car, put them in jail.
[00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:53.000]   I'm going to take charge.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.280]   I want to be the kick ass CEO at Microsoft.
[00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:56.600]   That's how you handle these things.
[00:31:56.600 --> 00:32:01.720]   The other way, Google is apparently now, no, no, Google won't admit this, but according
[00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:07.400]   to sources, and this is Peter Kafka, who's pretty good at all things D, Google's CEO
[00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:15.800]   Larry Page, Robert Kinsell, who's the boss of content at YouTube, met with the NFL recently,
[00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:21.160]   and by Commissioner Roger Goodell, apparently there might be some bidding, Google might
[00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:22.720]   bid for the Sunday ticket package.
[00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:25.520]   Currently, DirecTV has that for a billion dollars a year.
[00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:27.560]   It's extremely smart on both sides.
[00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:28.800]   Wouldn't it be cool?
[00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:31.840]   It's clear over the top, I guess that's the word, right?
[00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:35.800]   It's clear that people get their entertainment and they're used to getting their entertainment,
[00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:37.920]   getting more and more used to getting their entertainment with the internet.
[00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:38.920]   Yeah, over the internet.
[00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:39.920]   Disintermediated.
[00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:43.920]   So, I mean, the thing for the NFL is I think that behooves them to make sure that they
[00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:47.760]   also have a deal so that it can be seen by people that don't necessarily have.
[00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:50.600]   I mean, I think they want it to be seen by as many people as possible that are willing
[00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:51.600]   to pay for it.
[00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:54.720]   So, like the way it is right now for DirecTV is I could stream any football game on my
[00:32:54.720 --> 00:33:01.680]   phone if I either one have a DirecTV account or B can prove to DirecTV that I am not capable
[00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:04.040]   of getting service via one of their satellites.
[00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:06.640]   Otherwise, I'm not getting NFL Sunday ticket.
[00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:08.000]   What would the third have been in that list?
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   Because you said one and then B.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   And then B.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   And then I.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   Did I say it was the third?
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.200]   Anyway, don't tease him.
[00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:16.200]   He's.
[00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:20.800]   I just remember, you know, when CBS and drives a Tesla, you know, when CBS was having a
[00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:23.640]   huge fight with time war, I think it hasn't been resolved.
[00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:26.920]   But it was funny that there's some people that didn't quite realize and it was, you
[00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:30.080]   know, like this magic epiphany, like I can get it over the air.
[00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:33.080]   You know, you know, why, you know, I see CBS is waiting.
[00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:37.000]   They're waiting for the NFL season to start because then time warters got to cave their
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.960]   subscribers are going to say, where's my football?
[00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:41.360]   That's why football is huge in this.
[00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:44.560]   And it could be this could be the turning point.
[00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:46.360]   If you can get something like this to happen.
[00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:48.380]   I had a guy called a radio show today.
[00:33:48.380 --> 00:33:52.440]   He said, I want to watch Pac 12 football and it's not on time Warner.
[00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:54.420]   It's not on Verizon, Fios.
[00:33:54.420 --> 00:33:55.580]   You can't watch it.
[00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:58.480]   And even though it's streaming on the internet, they all do this.
[00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:00.240]   HBO goes as this too.
[00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:02.800]   You have to sign in using your cable company proof.
[00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:04.840]   You actually pay for it on regular TV.
[00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:08.480]   And this is an example of how we're stuck in the middle ages.
[00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:10.400]   We haven't made that transition to internet television.
[00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:12.920]   Well, that's why no one can license content very well.
[00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:17.200]   Or even if you're creating your own content, you can't get away from these legacy deals.
[00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:18.200]   So you look at HBO.
[00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:19.200]   Yeah, I was just going to say that.
[00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:21.200]   And they've got some of the best deals.
[00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:26.000]   But the way that you can use HBO go and you can watch any episode of any series that
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.160]   HBO has ever made ever.
[00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:32.760]   But they don't have the right to sell that themselves freely yet because there are too
[00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:34.360]   many of these deals.
[00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:36.440]   You've seen that amazing Kevin Spacey speech.
[00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:39.720]   I didn't watch it, but you know, it's funny because Olivia Wilde said the same thing this
[00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:42.400]   week too in an article on Buzzfeed that she wrote.
[00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:47.080]   So it seems like there's a lot of activity around, you know, in the Hollywood space from
[00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:48.080]   content creators and actors.
[00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:49.080]   You know what?
[00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:50.560]   If you're a content creator, this just stops you.
[00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:51.560]   This just gets in your way.
[00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:52.560]   You just want eyeballs.
[00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:53.560]   You just want people to watch you stop.
[00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:55.560]   You want to go directly to your audience.
[00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:57.200]   So Spacey, it's too long to play the whole thing.
[00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:58.680]   I highly recommend you watch it.
[00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:05.400]   He was speaking in Edinburgh at the International Television Festival presented by YouTube.
[00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:07.520]   And he talks about the house of cards.
[00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:08.520]   Interesting.
[00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:09.520]   Netflix.
[00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:12.320]   The first thing Spacey says is that we shopped.
[00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:14.680]   Well, he said, here's one problem.
[00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:15.680]   Pilots.
[00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:19.920]   He said hundreds of millions of dollars are spent every year in the pilot system to make
[00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:24.560]   TV shows, and of which fewer than half ever get produced.
[00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:28.280]   He said, we didn't want to do a pilot on House of Cards because it's an artificial
[00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:29.600]   constraint on that first episode.
[00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:34.000]   We wanted to do a tell a story that would take 12 episodes to develop that was very
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   subtle.
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.040]   You can't put enough in a pilot to tell.
[00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:38.400]   We didn't want to do a pilot.
[00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:42.560]   So when Netflix said, not only do you not have to do a pilot, you can produce all your episodes.
[00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:45.520]   We'll put them all on the internet at the same time.
[00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:47.000]   They're still lucky.
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   Very lucky.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   They're so hard to make.
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   Like everyone was giving credit.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   Great show.
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:52.760]   I love Netflix, and I think they did a good job with this.
[00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:53.760]   Or just in black.
[00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:57.360]   But when they developed House of Cards, they did the same formula that any other good TV
[00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:58.360]   series is.
[00:35:58.360 --> 00:36:03.080]   They came up with a good script, got some good actors, and they created the same methods
[00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:04.080]   of making television.
[00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:05.080]   But remember who's pitching this?
[00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:07.080]   Except they did their distribution model was different.
[00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:10.840]   Remember when he's pitching this, it's David Fincher and Kevin Spacey.
[00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:11.840]   And they couldn't get the network.
[00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:13.200]   They couldn't say, hey, I'm David Fincher.
[00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:14.200]   I'm Kevin Spacey.
[00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:15.360]   Give us, buy this.
[00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:17.920]   The network said no, you have to do a pilot.
[00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:20.960]   Netflix was the only company that said no, we'll give you a hundred million dollars.
[00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:24.400]   It's also a totally different method because they have the ability to create an entire
[00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:26.920]   season up front of the content.
[00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:31.480]   I mean, a lot of times when a show goes to television, it gets cut off halfway through.
[00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:35.440]   It gets canceled, or it makes it through the first season, the second season gets canceled.
[00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:37.440]   Only the whole show is changing.
[00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:38.440]   It's very format.
[00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:43.560]   It's changing its storylines because of these restrictions based on the season lengths.
[00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:47.760]   So this actually gives storytellers the opportunity to tell the full story without having to worry
[00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:49.320]   about getting canceled in season.
[00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:50.320]   There's plenty of things.
[00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:54.080]   The speech ends with him saying, listen, just we're blowing it.
[00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:57.440]   There's an opportunity to give the viewers what they want.
[00:36:57.440 --> 00:36:58.440]   And we're blowing it.
[00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:02.080]   As storytellers, he says, he loves the idea of binge viewing.
[00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:03.080]   Yeah.
[00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:04.080]   He says, I don't care.
[00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:05.080]   He's real.
[00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:06.080]   We do.
[00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:07.080]   That's what we want.
[00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:09.960]   We want to watch Game of Thrones all at once.
[00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:11.400]   There's no reason not to, right?
[00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:14.840]   Except for maybe word of mouth and buzz.
[00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:16.400]   You do give that up, right?
[00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:17.400]   A little bit.
[00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:18.400]   If we're not all, I don't know, because...
[00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:19.400]   Red wedding.
[00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:20.400]   Oh my God.
[00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:21.400]   Tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet.
[00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:22.400]   True.
[00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:27.320]   I guess for those really, those like linchpin episodes maybe.
[00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:32.480]   But the more people who have access to it and who can watch it, and the easier you make
[00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:37.640]   it to get into, to get really passionate about it, the more viral feedback you're going
[00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:38.640]   to get anyway.
[00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:40.760]   So I think they make it up in other ways.
[00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:43.160]   They did the best of both worlds because they're doing two seasons, right?
[00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:44.520]   So they launched one season.
[00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:47.000]   Everybody watched it, House of Cards all at once.
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:48.360]   And there's still going to be a second season.
[00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:51.240]   So they have the chance to get the buzz.
[00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:55.600]   If you haven't watched this speech, first of all, play a little audio because he's a
[00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:56.880]   great speaker.
[00:37:56.880 --> 00:38:00.760]   If you're watching a film on your television, is it no longer a film because you're not
[00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:01.760]   watching it in a theater?
[00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:05.080]   If you watch a TV show on your iPad, is it no longer a TV show?
[00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:06.280]   It's Dana Brunetti.
[00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:08.600]   The device you want to link, they're irrelevant.
[00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:14.760]   The labels are useless except perhaps to agents and managers and lawyers who use these labels
[00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:16.640]   to conduct business deals.
[00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:23.400]   But for kids growing up now, there's no difference watching Avatar on an iPad or watching YouTube
[00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:26.440]   on a TV or watching Game of Thrones on their computer.
[00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:28.280]   It's all content.
[00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:31.640]   It's just story and the audio.
[00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:32.640]   Keep playing.
[00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:38.120]   No, no, no, this is actually, let's play this through because this is really the salient
[00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:39.120]   point.
[00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:40.120]   Want stories.
[00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:42.440]   He says the audience wants story.
[00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:45.240]   They want stories.
[00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:47.840]   They're dying for them.
[00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:50.840]   Routing for us to give them the right thing.
[00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:56.000]   And they will talk about it, binge on it, carry it with them on the bus and to the hairdresser,
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:01.480]   push it on their friends, tweet, blog, Facebook, make fan pages, silly gifs, and God knows

[00:58:53.480 --> 00:58:54.480]   No.
[00:58:54.480 --> 00:58:55.480]   No.
[00:58:55.480 --> 00:58:56.480]   No.
[00:58:56.480 --> 00:58:57.480]   No.
[00:58:57.480 --> 00:58:58.480]   No.
[00:58:58.480 --> 00:58:59.480]   No.
[00:58:59.480 --> 00:59:00.480]   No.
[00:59:00.480 --> 00:59:01.480]   No.
[00:59:01.480 --> 00:59:02.480]   No.
[00:59:02.480 --> 00:59:03.480]   No.
[00:59:03.480 --> 00:59:04.480]   No.
[00:59:04.480 --> 00:59:05.480]   No.
[00:59:05.480 --> 00:59:06.480]   No.
[00:59:06.480 --> 00:59:07.480]   No.
[00:59:07.480 --> 00:59:08.480]   No.
[00:59:08.480 --> 00:59:09.480]   No.
[00:59:09.480 --> 00:59:10.480]   No.
[00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:11.480]   No.
[00:59:11.480 --> 00:59:12.480]   No.
[00:59:12.480 --> 00:59:13.480]   No.
[00:59:13.480 --> 00:59:14.480]   No.
[00:59:14.480 --> 00:59:15.480]   No.
[00:59:15.480 --> 00:59:16.480]   That's how fast.
[00:59:16.480 --> 00:59:19.480]   Hey, let's, by the way, before we get to the iPhone discussion, let's see, let's get Tom Merritt on.
[00:59:19.480 --> 00:59:20.480]   You know him, right?
[00:59:20.480 --> 00:59:21.480]   I do.
[00:59:21.480 --> 00:59:22.480]   I know Tom Meritt.
[00:59:22.480 --> 00:59:23.480]   Let's see what's coming up in the week ahead.
[00:59:23.480 --> 00:59:24.480]   Hey, thanks Leo.
[00:59:24.480 --> 00:59:27.480]   Here's some of the stories we'll be keeping an eye on in the week ahead on Tech News today.
[00:59:27.480 --> 00:59:30.480]   Monday, August 26th, VM World kicks off at San Francisco.
[00:59:30.480 --> 00:59:36.480]   Wednesday, August 28th, the new Nexus 7 heads to the UK for 199 pounds.
[00:59:36.480 --> 00:59:42.480]   Thursday, August 29th, Sim City for the Mac finally arrives, probably with less drama than when it came to windows.
[00:59:42.480 --> 00:59:48.480]   Friday, August 30th, the Blackberry Q10 hits Sprint and Dragoncon kicks off.
[00:59:48.480 --> 00:59:56.480]   And Saturday, August 31st, Sphero 2.0 arrives in stores and it's the last day to renew or
[00:59:56.480 --> 00:59:59.480]   buy a Technet subscription from Microsoft.
[00:59:59.480 --> 01:00:00.480]   That's a look at the week ahead.
[01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:01.480]   Back to you Leo.
[01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:04.480]   Microsoft phasing that out because people use it to pirate copies of Windows.
[01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:05.480]   That's how I used it.
[01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:06.480]   Really?
[01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:07.480]   Yeah.
[01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:08.480]   Dragoncon.
[01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:09.480]   Are you excited?
[01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:10.480]   Are you going?
[01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:11.480]   Yes, of course.
[01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:12.480]   Hotlana.
[01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:13.480]   Hotlana.
[01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:14.480]   Is the parade the best part?
[01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:16.480]   I usually actually skip the parade.
[01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:17.480]   Really?
[01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:18.480]   Yeah.
[01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:19.480]   Are you going to cosplay?
[01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:20.480]   Not this year.
[01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:21.480]   You've done that in the past?
[01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:22.480]   Half.
[01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:23.480]   Who do you dress up as?
[01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:25.480]   I would say Demon Hunter from Diablo 3 last year.
[01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:26.480]   Nice.
[01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:27.480]   Why don't you just reuse it?
[01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:29.480]   Because it's really hot there.
[01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:31.480]   And I don't have to stand there.
[01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:32.480]   Lata and August.
[01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:33.480]   What a time.
[01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:34.480]   What a time.
[01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:35.480]   To walk around in that costume.
[01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:36.480]   I can only think they got the haul cheap.
[01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:40.480]   Plus you have to ship it and you have to like, you know, check it and luggage and it's kind of annoying.
[01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:41.480]   Excuse me, ma'am.
[01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:45.480]   Would you like to explain what this Demon Hunter outfit is for?
[01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:47.480]   What the Demon Hunter outfit is for?
[01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:50.480]   No, I'm just saying TSA is not going to...
[01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:51.480]   Oh!
[01:00:51.480 --> 01:00:52.480]   Yes.
[01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:53.480]   Not a good thing.
[01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:54.480]   Well, the crossbow will be difficult to explain.
[01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:55.480]   Crossbow.
[01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:57.480]   That might be a problem.
[01:00:57.480 --> 01:01:00.480]   That's done by the TSA.
[01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:02.480]   How many people are here for VMware?
[01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:03.480]   See?
[01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:04.480]   This is why we have a big audience today.
[01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:05.480]   A lot of geeks.
[01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:06.480]   Welcome.
[01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:07.480]   Nice to have you.
[01:01:07.480 --> 01:01:12.480]   There was a guy had a t-shirt that said, "Back the F up."
[01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:13.480]   I think from last year's.
[01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:14.480]   That's awesome.
[01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:15.480]   F-s-backslash.
[01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:16.480]   Yeah.
[01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:17.480]   Yeah.
[01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:19.480]   That was from last year's VMware.
[01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:20.480]   All right.
[01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:26.480]   So the rumors are, oh gosh, they're just really flying, fast and furious about new iPhones.
[01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:28.480]   September 10th, we all agree.
[01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:29.480]   That's good.
[01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:32.480]   You still have sources, sources in this kind of area from gadget?
[01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:33.480]   I can either confirm or deny.
[01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:34.480]   Oh, I like it.
[01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:35.480]   I like it.
[01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:36.480]   That sounds like you know some.
[01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:39.480]   I can confirm or deny that either.
[01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:40.480]   I know not.
[01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:42.480]   I can also not confirm or deny.
[01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:47.280]   There's invitations that Apple sends out, apparently, if you get when they are asking you not to
[01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:48.480]   share it, is I heard that from somebody.
[01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:49.480]   That's the new thing.
[01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:50.480]   Somebody told me that.
[01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:51.480]   Wait a minute.
[01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:53.480]   They've never done that before.
[01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:56.480]   Usually the invitations go out one week before the event.
[01:01:56.480 --> 01:02:00.480]   So they're now sending them out earlier and telling people, "Is that what you're trying
[01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:01.480]   to confirm or deny?"
[01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:03.480]   I can neither confirm or deny.
[01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:05.480]   Oh, that's very interesting.
[01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:06.480]   I don't know.
[01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:09.480]   I don't think that they're doing anything in terms of sending them out earlier though.
[01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:11.000]   I think that they send them out.
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:12.800]   They always send them out about a week before.
[01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:13.800]   Okay, so you haven't.
[01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:14.800]   You're usually pretty consistent.
[01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:16.280]   You're not confirming or denying that.
[01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:17.480]   I can neither confirm or deny.
[01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:18.480]   I just know.
[01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:19.480]   I mean, I haven't.
[01:02:19.480 --> 01:02:22.480]   That's interesting because if they had already sent them out, we wouldn't know if that's
[01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:23.480]   the case.
[01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:24.480]   Yeah, they're very consistent.
[01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:26.600]   Well, I just hope that it's usually one week before.
[01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:30.480]   I hope that Ryan goes because he's my favorite live blogger of Apple events.
[01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:31.480]   Oh, shock.
[01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:32.480]   Now, were you still doing it?
[01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:33.480]   Yeah.
[01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:34.480]   But if he was hired by the...
[01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:35.480]   I'm not going to judge it now.
[01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:36.480]   Oh, good.
[01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:37.480]   Yeah.
[01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:38.480]   Okay, of course.
[01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:39.480]   Because I will say I do enjoy...
[01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:42.880]   I like the engine that the Verge has for live blogging, but Ryan Block here specifically,
[01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:44.080]   he trumps the engine into the Verge.
[01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:45.080]   Does he get snarky?
[01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:46.480]   I get a little snarky.
[01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:47.480]   A little snarky.
[01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:51.760]   But if they follow suit to what they did last time, they'll stream the whole event.
[01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:52.760]   I hope so.
[01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:54.120]   So, Ian, we'll do the same thing.
[01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:57.920]   If it's September 10th, I think it is, we'll be doing the same thing from our studio covering
[01:02:57.920 --> 01:02:58.920]   the stream.
[01:02:58.920 --> 01:02:59.920]   You have a puppet Tim Cook, right?
[01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:00.920]   We did that once.
[01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:01.920]   I don't know if we'll do the Ryan Hog.
[01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:02.920]   No, I liked it.
[01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:03.920]   I don't care what anybody else said.
[01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:04.920]   I liked it.
[01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:05.920]   I don't know if we'll do it again.
[01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:06.920]   You know, I like to mix it up.
[01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:07.920]   So, they're going to be too...
[01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:10.280]   We did the puppets because they weren't doing a live stream.
[01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:12.280]   We don't need a puppet if they do a live stream.
[01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:13.280]   We were reenacting it.
[01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:15.200]   We didn't give a puppet for context to live reenacting it.
[01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:16.200]   We were reenacting it.
[01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:17.200]   Okay.
[01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:20.080]   So, Tim Cook would come out and puppet Tim Cook would come out.
[01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:22.760]   Tim Cook would stick his hand in his pants, puppet Tim Cook would stick his hand in his
[01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:23.760]   pants.
[01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:24.760]   That kind of thing.
[01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:25.760]   No, it's pocket.
[01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:26.760]   Jeez, Louise.
[01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:30.000]   So, September 10th, that's probably the case.
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:31.600]   Too many people have said so.
[01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:32.840]   Here's the thing that surprises me.
[01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:39.320]   The same sources are saying two phones, 5S and 5C, 5C plastic back in colors.
[01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:43.160]   The 5S, this is the thing that surprised me, in black, white and gold.
[01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:44.160]   Chum-pene.
[01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:45.160]   Chum-pon.
[01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:46.160]   Chum-pon.
[01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:47.160]   Yeah.
[01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:48.160]   Chum-pon.
[01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:49.160]   Yeah.
[01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:50.160]   There's some pretty good mock-up photos.
[01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:51.160]   Maybe some new ones.
[01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:52.160]   They might.
[01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:53.160]   They're like the real...
[01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:54.160]   I might do it.
[01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:55.160]   It might not only be in those three, though.
[01:03:55.160 --> 01:03:56.160]   Remember...
[01:03:56.160 --> 01:03:57.160]   Gold is in again.
[01:03:57.160 --> 01:03:58.160]   It's...
[01:03:58.160 --> 01:03:59.160]   Well, especially in China, it's like huge.
[01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:00.160]   China in India.
[01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:01.160]   Yeah.
[01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:02.160]   It's like the third, like the data to that stool is gold.
[01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:03.160]   It's a little weird.
[01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:04.160]   It's a little weird.
[01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:05.160]   Right, but they could potentially do more colors.
[01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:07.160]   They probably do red, 'cause they always partner with red.
[01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:08.160]   So, there might be more...
[01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:10.160]   But you're thinking of the 5C, the color one.
[01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:11.160]   This would be pretty cool.
[01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:12.160]   No, no, no, I'm talking about the 5S.
[01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:14.160]   You think we're gonna do more colors than just three?
[01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:15.160]   Than just black, white.
[01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:20.160]   Well, technically, it's like slate and silver and...
[01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:21.160]   Champagne.
[01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:22.160]   Yeah.
[01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:30.160]   I poo-pooted, I thought, oh, that's tacky.
[01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:31.160]   That's Paris Hilton.
[01:04:31.160 --> 01:04:34.160]   But then you saw the actual Good Market, right?
[01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:36.160]   And then I realized I wanted it.
[01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:37.160]   Yeah.
[01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:38.160]   So, I think, actually...
[01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:39.160]   It's for me, actually.
[01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:41.160]   I would not kick it out of bed.
[01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:42.160]   Yeah, it's a good thing.
[01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:43.160]   I like it.
[01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:44.160]   So, look, an iPhone.
[01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:46.160]   And, you know, it has an advantage, which is people know you got the new iPhone.
[01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:47.160]   This is a problem with the S...
[01:04:47.160 --> 01:04:48.160]   The S...
[01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:49.160]   Well, no, this...
[01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:50.160]   Okay, I'm not...
[01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:51.160]   You can flaunt your riches.
[01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:52.160]   Yeah.
[01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:55.160]   The problem with S is it looks exactly like the one before.
[01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:57.160]   3GS looks like 3G.
[01:04:57.160 --> 01:04:59.160]   The 4S looks just like a 4.
[01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:02.160]   Nobody knows you've got the new thing.
[01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:03.160]   So, I think it's smart.
[01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:05.160]   Make it champagne.
[01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:08.160]   And then people will look at me with envy and awe.
[01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:12.160]   That's why people do that, right?
[01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:16.160]   The other thing that I also poo-pooted, but now I'm thinking...
[01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:19.160]   Because everybody seems to agree, is thumbprint or fingerprint in the home button.
[01:05:19.160 --> 01:05:21.160]   Oh, you're excited about that, though, aren't you?
[01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:22.160]   Very excited.
[01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:24.160]   Well, maybe not necessarily in the home button, but it's anywhere.
[01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:25.160]   It was anywhere.
[01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:27.160]   It'd be sensible to put it right there.
[01:05:27.160 --> 01:05:29.160]   In fact, Renee Ritchie...
[01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:35.160]   Who's got good sources at iMore and John Pichkowski at All Things D.
[01:05:35.160 --> 01:05:39.160]   Both say a depressed, sapphire-coated button in the home button.
[01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:40.160]   So you want to know why?
[01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:41.160]   Hit the home button?
[01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:42.160]   Okay.
[01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:43.160]   Okay.
[01:05:43.160 --> 01:05:45.160]   Well, you got a bunch of stuff up there, but if he's allowed to unlock it...
[01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:47.160]   Well, this is your phone not mine.
[01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:48.160]   Yeah.
[01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:49.160]   And so...
[01:05:49.160 --> 01:05:50.160]   Yeah, I want to do that.
[01:05:50.160 --> 01:05:51.160]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:52.160]   I don't want to do that either.
[01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:56.160]   What if I, instead of even seeing all that, what if when I hit the home button, it just unlocks?
[01:05:56.160 --> 01:05:57.160]   Oh, I see it's you, Ryan.
[01:05:57.160 --> 01:05:58.160]   Yeah.
[01:05:58.160 --> 01:05:59.160]   I like that.
[01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:02.160]   I think for thievery, it's good.
[01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:05.160]   I mean, not good, but it's good for you against thieves.
[01:06:05.160 --> 01:06:09.160]   The best idea I heard about anti-theft was today from Ryan as well, that you should have
[01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:12.160]   to enter a code to turn the phone off.
[01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:14.160]   So that way you can still track it.
[01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:16.160]   So if someone steals it, they can't turn it off.
[01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:17.160]   Brilliant.
[01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:18.160]   Yeah.
[01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:19.160]   Because that's the first thing I've been...
[01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:20.160]   We missed all that idea.
[01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:21.160]   It's an apple.
[01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:22.160]   I've the mayor already have had it.
[01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:23.160]   That might be maybe part of the...
[01:06:23.160 --> 01:06:24.160]   Hi, apple.
[01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:25.160]   Hi, please.
[01:06:25.160 --> 01:06:29.160]   And then the only concern was what if you need to hard reset it because it freezes, but then
[01:06:29.160 --> 01:06:30.160]   you reset it and it turns back on.
[01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:33.160]   You just reset it and then you're back to the password again.
[01:06:33.160 --> 01:06:35.360]   I think that's a really good idea.
[01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:39.160]   The other advantage, of course, is that passports suddenly could be useful.
[01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:41.160]   Oh, but then chatroom's saying the battery.
[01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:42.160]   Pull the battery.
[01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:43.160]   How do you pull the battery in the battery?
[01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:44.160]   It's an enclosed device.
[01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:45.160]   Yeah, chatroom.
[01:06:45.160 --> 01:06:46.160]   How do you pull the battery?
[01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:47.160]   Yeah, chatroom.
[01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:48.160]   Yeah.
[01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:50.160]   And now they're going to link to the iFixit page.
[01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:51.160]   Guess what?
[01:06:51.160 --> 01:06:52.160]   Thieves are not that smart.
[01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:53.160]   They stole a phone from someone.
[01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:54.160]   They're idiots.
[01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:55.160]   The clock is ticking.
[01:06:55.160 --> 01:06:56.160]   Yes.
[01:06:56.160 --> 01:06:57.160]   So they don't want to mess around with it.
[01:06:57.160 --> 01:07:02.160]   In fact, I've told them when they steal a phone, the very first thing they do is turn off an
[01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:05.360]   iPhone because they're not stupid enough to think that people aren't going to come after
[01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:06.680]   them with fine my iPhone.
[01:07:06.680 --> 01:07:08.760]   So they turn off right away.
[01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:10.560]   And the iPhone will just know where it was.
[01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:13.160]   Ooh, I'm trying to let the battery die on its own.
[01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:16.480]   Well, that's right, but that's enough time for you to chase them down.
[01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:17.480]   True.
[01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:19.040]   Hopefully, if you're charged.
[01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:21.960]   So do we all agree that fingerprint is a good idea?
[01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:22.960]   It is a very good idea.
[01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:23.960]   Probably what's going to happen.
[01:07:23.960 --> 01:07:24.960]   Very good idea.
[01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:28.080]   And imagine what you could do with that in, say, your email app.
[01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:30.080]   If there was an API from the fingerprint sensor into--
[01:07:30.080 --> 01:07:31.080]   That's so bad.
[01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:35.520]   Then how am I going to read all your text messages if I need a thumbprint to get in?
[01:07:35.520 --> 01:07:36.520]   Exactly.
[01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:37.520]   It's the wife thing.
[01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:38.520]   What is the answer?
[01:07:38.520 --> 01:07:39.520]   There's always going to be two options.
[01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:42.760]   There's going to be a code or a thumbprint.
[01:07:42.760 --> 01:07:43.760]   Right.
[01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:44.760]   And I think--
[01:07:44.760 --> 01:07:45.760]   I mean, I think that both would always be a little bit.
[01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:46.760]   I know the code.
[01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:49.480]   I can't copy the thumbprint unless I cut off this thumb.
[01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:50.480]   Exactly.
[01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:52.840]   Veronica, you've seen many spy movies.
[01:07:52.840 --> 01:07:53.840]   Okay.
[01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:54.840]   The thumbprints are all over the place.
[01:07:54.840 --> 01:07:55.840]   You just dust them in a bag.
[01:07:55.840 --> 01:07:56.840]   I can lift them and do a little tape.
[01:07:56.840 --> 01:07:57.840]   Lift it up on the whole thing.
[01:07:57.840 --> 01:08:01.200]   You have to simulate the blood flow behind the thumb.
[01:08:01.200 --> 01:08:02.200]   Mythbusters did this.
[01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:03.200]   Yeah, it's totally--
[01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:04.200]   Yeah.
[01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:05.200]   Okay.
[01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:06.200]   I don't want to say something about Mythbusters.
[01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:07.200]   I love those guys.
[01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:08.200]   It's great.
[01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:09.200]   It's a TV show.
[01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:10.200]   It's not science.
[01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:11.200]   Okay?
[01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:12.200]   It is science.
[01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:13.200]   It's talking about--
[01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:14.200]   It's an entertainment deal.
[01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:15.200]   Whoa.
[01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:16.200]   Whoa.
[01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:17.200]   Whoa.
[01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:18.200]   There.
[01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:20.240]   Because people always say, oh no, the Mythbusters refuted that.
[01:08:20.240 --> 01:08:21.240]   Yeah.
[01:08:21.240 --> 01:08:22.240]   On a TV show.
[01:08:22.240 --> 01:08:23.240]   It's not like scientific reference.
[01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:24.240]   It's a scientific reference.
[01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:25.240]   It's a scientific reference.
[01:08:25.240 --> 01:08:26.240]   It's a scientific reference.
[01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:27.240]   It's a scientific reference.

[01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:43.240]   The peer review is the card that's being held up.
[01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:44.240]   There's no peer review.
[01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:45.240]   There is.
[01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:46.240]   They have forums.
[01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:50.240]   If the people in the forum say something wrong, they go back and redo it.
[01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:52.240]   I know it's among other scientists.
[01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:54.240]   But it's the honey bubble of science.
[01:10:54.240 --> 01:10:56.240]   There's the honey bubble of science.
[01:10:56.240 --> 01:11:02.240]   There's peer review, though, because they put it out to an audience of millions of people who could potentially replicate it.
[01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:03.240]   That is the definition.
[01:11:03.240 --> 01:11:04.240]   I know.
[01:11:04.240 --> 01:11:08.240]   There's a lot of people out there saying let's see if this really worked and they're doing it in their home.
[01:11:08.240 --> 01:11:09.240]   How did we get on this time?
[01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:18.240]   No, I'm just saying that every time I bring up fingerprints, people say, "Oh, no, the mythbusters proved that it's not reliable or something."
[01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:20.240]   And I don't think that means anything.
[01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:22.240]   I just got like a plus 11115.
[01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:23.240]   I know.
[01:11:23.240 --> 01:11:23.240]   I know.
[01:11:23.240 --> 01:11:24.240]   That's scientific too.
[01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:25.240]   That's peer review right there.
[01:11:25.240 --> 01:11:26.240]   Thank you.
[01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:27.240]   All right.
[01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:28.240]   I take it all back.
[01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:30.240]   When you look at the atom, I'm sorry.
[01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:32.240]   I never say that again.
[01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:33.240]   What do you think is a cheap iPhone?
[01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:35.240]   I think it's a smart movement.
[01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:36.240]   I don't think it's cheap.
[01:11:36.240 --> 01:11:37.240]   That's the interesting--
[01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:38.240]   The most inexpensive.
[01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:41.240]   The newest part of the story is it's in fact not a cheap iPhone.
[01:11:41.240 --> 01:11:42.240]   Yeah, I don't think it will be cheap.
[01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:49.240]   I don't think it will be inexpensive enough to help Apple penetrate developing markets, developing nations.
[01:11:49.240 --> 01:11:50.240]   So why are they doing it?
[01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:51.240]   And what's the point?
[01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:52.240]   Yeah.
[01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:53.240]   I actually don't know either.
[01:11:53.240 --> 01:11:54.240]   I think we've got to find out.
[01:11:54.240 --> 01:12:04.240]   I think that they want to offer something in the same vein as the five, but maybe-- so get more people to the five form factor.
[01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:09.240]   So it's taller screen, but not have it be as expensive as the five.
[01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:14.240]   So maybe it will sit alongside the four S, right?
[01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:20.240]   Because every year they take last year's model and they make the free one, so there's a free a 99 and a 199.
[01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:22.240]   That's another rumor that they're going to discontinue all of this.
[01:12:22.240 --> 01:12:24.240]   They'll have just the two current models.
[01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:25.240]   They'll stop having the old models.
[01:12:25.240 --> 01:12:27.240]   I think that this is working really well for them though.
[01:12:27.240 --> 01:12:28.240]   It does, yeah.
[01:12:28.240 --> 01:12:29.240]   It is working really well for them.
[01:12:29.240 --> 01:12:33.240]   You see a lot of people with new four S's because of that.
[01:12:33.240 --> 01:12:34.240]   It's possible they can do it.
[01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:39.240]   And if they did do it, I wouldn't be surprised because I'm never surprised when they do anything.
[01:12:39.240 --> 01:12:42.240]   They like to throw a curveball.
[01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:45.240]   But I think what the system they've got is working.
[01:12:45.240 --> 01:12:51.240]   And if they can find a place in that lineup for a five S device that does not cost as much.
[01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:52.240]   Shh.
[01:12:52.240 --> 01:12:53.240]   Will they call it the five S's?
[01:12:53.240 --> 01:12:54.240]   The five S's.
[01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:55.240]   Yes.
[01:12:55.240 --> 01:12:56.240]   I like that.
[01:12:56.240 --> 01:12:57.240]   Yes.
[01:12:57.240 --> 01:12:58.240]   The SQ.
[01:12:58.240 --> 01:12:59.240]   Yes.
[01:12:59.240 --> 01:13:03.240]   Well, who is it's not for developing world.
[01:13:03.240 --> 01:13:04.240]   It's for...
[01:13:04.240 --> 01:13:05.240]   I don't think so.
[01:13:05.240 --> 01:13:06.240]   No.
[01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:11.240]   Because I mean at that point it literally has to be, if you're going to sell it to rural
[01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:17.240]   India or Sub-Saharan Africa, it literally has to be a $20 device.
[01:13:17.240 --> 01:13:18.240]   Right.
[01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:20.240]   There are only a handful of companies who can make phones that cheap.
[01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:21.240]   Yeah.
[01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:22.240]   And they're almost...
[01:13:22.240 --> 01:13:23.240]   They're almost...
[01:13:23.240 --> 01:13:24.240]   The dumbest of dumb phones.
[01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:25.240]   Right.
[01:13:25.240 --> 01:13:26.240]   They do nothing effectively.
[01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:28.240]   So Apple is not there yet.
[01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:29.840]   And the phone is not the answer to that.
[01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:32.240]   It will just be a cheaper iPhone.
[01:13:32.240 --> 01:13:33.240]   Okay.
[01:13:33.240 --> 01:13:38.800]   I still think that they're trying to adopt more iOS users and they think it's a gateway.
[01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:40.560]   For somebody, maybe it's not...
[01:13:40.560 --> 01:13:43.880]   Maybe the mass market is the $20 phone market and they're hitting it wrong.
[01:13:43.880 --> 01:13:45.880]   But they're...
[01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:47.960]   They have to be shooting for...
[01:13:47.960 --> 01:13:51.160]   Get into a market that they're not in.
[01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:52.640]   Somebody in the chat room is making a good point.
[01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:54.240]   The forest does not support LTE.
[01:13:54.240 --> 01:13:55.240]   Yeah.
[01:13:55.240 --> 01:13:56.960]   So if Gary does want all LTE.
[01:13:56.960 --> 01:13:57.960]   So this is really...
[01:13:57.960 --> 01:14:02.960]   So this could be a platform to get rid of all this.
[01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:05.480]   Just get a couple of the back generations.
[01:14:05.480 --> 01:14:06.480]   That makes sense.
[01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:07.480]   Yes.
[01:14:07.480 --> 01:14:08.480]   It's an LTE cheaper phone.
[01:14:08.480 --> 01:14:10.680]   Well, it's also the taller screen too, which is important.
[01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:11.680]   Right.
[01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:12.680]   And it's lightning.
[01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:13.680]   They've got to get rid of 30 pin.
[01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:14.680]   Yep.
[01:14:14.680 --> 01:14:15.680]   So that's...
[01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:16.680]   You know what?
[01:14:16.680 --> 01:14:17.680]   That makes sense.
[01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:18.680]   Now, does that make sense?
[01:14:18.680 --> 01:14:19.680]   That makes sense.
[01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:20.680]   Yeah.
[01:14:20.680 --> 01:14:22.040]   We've got to move people a little faster forward because we've got to have LTE, we've got to
[01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:23.920]   have lightning, we've got to have the new aspect.
[01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:25.520]   So in some ways it's a bridge product.
[01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:26.520]   That makes sense.
[01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:27.520]   It's a bridge product.
[01:14:27.520 --> 01:14:28.520]   It's a lot of sense.
[01:14:28.520 --> 01:14:29.520]   Or it could be.
[01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:35.680]   iOS 7, a lot of people are saying this is going to be the real surprise when you...
[01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:38.440]   I know some people at this table have used iOS 7.
[01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:40.080]   I mean, what's the surprise?
[01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:41.080]   Right.
[01:14:41.080 --> 01:14:42.080]   I mean, we've seen 7...
[01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:43.080]   Surprise!
[01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:44.080]   It's totally different.
[01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:45.080]   I've seen 7 betas.
[01:14:45.080 --> 01:14:46.080]   By now we have a pretty good idea of what it is.
[01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:47.080]   From what you're used to.
[01:14:47.080 --> 01:14:50.760]   But a number of people said, you know, with the physics particle engine and some of the
[01:14:50.760 --> 01:14:57.480]   behind the scenes stuff going on in iOS 7, you may see a radically better looking...
[01:14:57.480 --> 01:14:59.120]   More powerful OS.
[01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:01.840]   Well, they also programmed it.
[01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:02.840]   Smarter.
[01:15:02.840 --> 01:15:06.680]   They'll know what you use more often and then route processing power to the things that
[01:15:06.680 --> 01:15:07.680]   you're using.
[01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:12.640]   It could be a markedly improved battery life because it's going to gang all of the updates
[01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:14.440]   together.
[01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:15.440]   That's...
[01:15:15.440 --> 01:15:18.680]   You know, for every feature they talk about fingerprint reading and everything, when
[01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:22.880]   I talk to real people, all they really say is just get me through the gd day.
[01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:26.280]   If I could just get 16 hours out of my phone.
[01:15:26.280 --> 01:15:28.280]   That would be the killer feature.
[01:15:28.280 --> 01:15:29.280]   The battery life.
[01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:30.280]   Isn't it?
[01:15:30.280 --> 01:15:31.280]   Yeah.
[01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:32.280]   Just give me a day.
[01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:34.280]   Don't make me have to charge it at 7 p.m.
[01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:36.760]   I mean, I love the battery life on this thing.
[01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:37.760]   Are you getting good battery life?
[01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:38.760]   Pretty good.
[01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:39.760]   Yeah.
[01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:42.760]   Initially I got terrible battery life and I rooted it and I put a bunch of green, you
[01:15:42.760 --> 01:15:43.920]   know, sleep stuff on it.
[01:15:43.920 --> 01:15:45.320]   But maybe they've got it better.
[01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:49.720]   Yeah, it's been better than for me than the iPhone 5 was personally.
[01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:50.920]   No phone is great yet.
[01:15:50.920 --> 01:15:55.040]   Except for things like the Droid Max and things like that where you get this really ugly
[01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:58.480]   phone with a ginormous battery or a note galaxy note.
[01:15:58.480 --> 01:16:02.920]   And every year we get incremental increases in battery life, but then we also get different
[01:16:02.920 --> 01:16:07.040]   applications and services that then drain that battery a little bit more intensely.
[01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:10.760]   Well, and this is the challenge because you don't have, you don't have a new, you can't
[01:16:10.760 --> 01:16:14.880]   make a bigger battery in this thing because you're not changing the form factor enough.
[01:16:14.880 --> 01:16:18.160]   So you've got, and you've got a new processor which Clayton Morris tweeted today and he's
[01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:19.160]   got pretty good sources.
[01:16:19.160 --> 01:16:20.160]   31% faster.
[01:16:20.160 --> 01:16:22.840]   Not fast enough.
[01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:24.560]   That's not fast enough?
[01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:25.560]   Not fast enough.
[01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:26.560]   I need more speed.
[01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:27.560]   Yeah, only a third faster.
[01:16:27.560 --> 01:16:30.360]   Come on, if you don't double it every year, you're not.
[01:16:30.360 --> 01:16:31.360]   It's sad.
[01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:32.360]   You got it.
[01:16:32.360 --> 01:16:33.360]   You got to stay.
[01:16:33.360 --> 01:16:34.360]   I haven't even noticed it.
[01:16:34.360 --> 01:16:38.320]   But what if 20 hour battery life?
[01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:39.560]   Wouldn't that be like a killer feature?
[01:16:39.560 --> 01:16:40.560]   That's a slam dunk.
[01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:46.680]   And we have doubled iOS 7 has allowed us with the same battery to double the battery life.
[01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:50.760]   I could see Tim Cook saying that to a standing ovation to double the battery life.
[01:16:50.760 --> 01:16:51.760]   Wouldn't that be great?
[01:16:51.760 --> 01:16:52.760]   I don't know.
[01:16:52.760 --> 01:16:53.760]   Maybe not.
[01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:54.760]   It would be great.
[01:16:54.760 --> 01:16:56.760]   It's not going to happen.
[01:16:56.760 --> 01:16:57.760]   Okay.
[01:16:57.760 --> 01:16:58.760]   We'll take a break.
[01:16:58.760 --> 01:17:03.200]   Come back with more from Techzilla, the very scientific show on Discovery.
[01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:05.200]   On Discovery Channel.
[01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:09.640]   The science show on Discovery Channel, Patrick Norton's co-host.
[01:17:09.640 --> 01:17:12.440]   Now, you were saying that you're going to do the dailies.
[01:17:12.440 --> 01:17:14.760]   You're going to fold those into something or what are you doing?
[01:17:14.760 --> 01:17:17.600]   Yeah, we're just folding that more into the show.
[01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:19.040]   We haven't really talked about it too much.
[01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:22.000]   But yeah, it's just because we want to go more in depth on the dailies and we want to
[01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:23.640]   do a lot more cool stuff with Techzilla.
[01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:27.160]   So we're taking the resources from the dailies and kind of bringing them back into the show.
[01:17:27.160 --> 01:17:28.160]   What are the cool stuff you're going to do, huh?
[01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:29.160]   I don't know.
[01:17:29.160 --> 01:17:32.560]   Yeah, more like out in the field kind of stuff and more like great, great, you know, builds
[01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:33.560]   and things like that.
[01:17:33.560 --> 01:17:36.520]   So does the Discovery acquisition help you kind of expand the show?
[01:17:36.520 --> 01:17:38.360]   It literally has not changed anything at all.
[01:17:38.360 --> 01:17:39.360]   It doesn't change anything.
[01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:40.360]   It's all been the same.
[01:17:40.360 --> 01:17:41.360]   But it's good.
[01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:45.040]   Well, you don't want it to change it in the bad way, which you'd like maybe more resources
[01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:46.040]   more.
[01:17:46.040 --> 01:17:47.040]   Yeah.
[01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:48.040]   Yeah.
[01:17:48.040 --> 01:17:49.040]   I mean, that would be great.
[01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:50.040]   It's still pretty, pretty new.
[01:17:50.040 --> 01:17:51.040]   So we're still seeing how it goes.
[01:17:51.040 --> 01:17:53.640]   I'm only a contractor still, so I'm not even there for the day to date.
[01:17:53.640 --> 01:17:54.640]   You don't even work for them?
[01:17:54.640 --> 01:17:55.640]   No, I'm a contractor.
[01:17:55.640 --> 01:17:56.640]   Oh, man.
[01:17:56.640 --> 01:17:57.640]   I'm a free agent.
[01:17:57.640 --> 01:17:58.640]   Oh, man.
[01:17:58.640 --> 01:17:59.640]   I am me.
[01:17:59.640 --> 01:18:02.560]   Veronica, a wonderful Veronica Belmont.
[01:18:02.560 --> 01:18:07.440]   I would hire in a heartbeat if I just had a way to do it.
[01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:09.480]   But I don't have a show for you.
[01:18:09.480 --> 01:18:10.800]   Maybe that we could do a gaming show.
[01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:11.800]   A gaming show.
[01:18:11.800 --> 01:18:12.800]   I'm going to do the gaming show.
[01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:13.800]   I'm talking about that.
[01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:14.800]   Yeah.
[01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:16.800]   It was that Freshwood guy that really brought it down.
[01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:17.800]   That's not true.
[01:18:17.800 --> 01:18:18.800]   No, I mean, it's kidding.
[01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:20.360]   He didn't spike his hair at all.
[01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:21.360]   He doesn't know.
[01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:22.360]   He looks good.
[01:18:22.360 --> 01:18:23.360]   I love his flat hair.
[01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:24.360]   Yeah.
[01:18:24.360 --> 01:18:25.360]   It's good.
[01:18:25.360 --> 01:18:26.360]   It's good luck.
[01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:27.360]   Yeah, I think so.
[01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:28.360]   I think he's old enough now.
[01:18:28.360 --> 01:18:29.360]   He's like 53 years old, you know.
[01:18:29.360 --> 01:18:30.360]   He's like 75 years old now.
[01:18:30.360 --> 01:18:31.360]   Yeah.
[01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:32.360]   And so it's time.
[01:18:32.360 --> 01:18:33.360]   Yeah.
[01:18:33.360 --> 01:18:34.360]   You kind of grow up a little bit.
[01:18:34.360 --> 01:18:35.840]   Also here I am blocked.
[01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:40.880]   He is now product, VP product at AOL, and of course editor emeritus sitting gadget,
[01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:42.760]   founding editor at gadget.
[01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:44.840]   And great to have you.
[01:18:44.840 --> 01:18:49.800]   So will you be in the, you expect to get an invitation from Apple and live blog that?
[01:18:49.800 --> 01:18:50.800]   I hope you never know.
[01:18:50.800 --> 01:18:51.800]   I hope you do.
[01:18:51.800 --> 01:18:52.800]   You never know.
[01:18:52.800 --> 01:18:53.800]   David Prager and I are hoping.
[01:18:53.800 --> 01:18:56.440]   If they do send me an email with the invitation I will.
[01:18:56.440 --> 01:18:57.440]   Yeah.
[01:18:57.440 --> 01:18:59.200]   Mr. Prager has got a new show which I love Distort.
[01:18:59.200 --> 01:19:00.760]   Thank you.
[01:19:00.760 --> 01:19:02.800]   You take stuff and you slow it way down.
[01:19:02.800 --> 01:19:04.480]   And it's got science.
[01:19:04.480 --> 01:19:05.480]   It does.
[01:19:05.480 --> 01:19:06.480]   It does.
[01:19:06.480 --> 01:19:10.840]   We try to, we try to, we will end up at different universities interviewing like professors
[01:19:10.840 --> 01:19:15.680]   of chemistry and physics and I think that's great and scientists on.
[01:19:15.680 --> 01:19:16.680]   So it's good.
[01:19:16.680 --> 01:19:19.840]   We call it Distort because we also want to leave things open to Distort other things.
[01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:22.720]   So we could do time lapse or we could do macro.
[01:19:22.720 --> 01:19:23.880]   It doesn't just have to be slowed down.
[01:19:23.880 --> 01:19:25.200]   It could be a lot of stuff.
[01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:27.080]   It's youtube.com/distort.
[01:19:27.080 --> 01:19:28.520]   Correct.
[01:19:28.520 --> 01:19:31.600]   And I'm just me.
[01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:33.040]   I'm not very sciencey at all.
[01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:34.320]   So that's how come I don't know.
[01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:36.720]   I'm just sorry.
[01:19:36.720 --> 01:19:39.480]   People are throwing down on Twitter about you and Mythbusters now.
[01:19:39.480 --> 01:19:41.680]   I told you Twitter isn't full of bitches.
[01:19:41.680 --> 01:19:42.680]   Stop it.
[01:19:42.680 --> 01:19:46.280]   I don't read it anymore.
[01:19:46.280 --> 01:19:49.440]   It's just a bitch fest.
[01:19:49.440 --> 01:19:50.440]   Isn't it?
[01:19:50.440 --> 01:19:51.440]   No.
[01:19:51.440 --> 01:19:52.440]   No.
[01:19:52.440 --> 01:19:53.440]   You like Twitter?
[01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:54.440]   I love Twitter.
[01:19:54.440 --> 01:19:55.440]   Maybe it's because I call them bitches that they.
[01:19:55.440 --> 01:19:56.440]   That's probably why.
[01:19:56.440 --> 01:19:57.440]   Maybe that's a mistake.
[01:19:57.440 --> 01:20:00.280]   You see I have two thousand fifty five new tweets.
[01:20:00.280 --> 01:20:01.280]   I haven't looked in ages.
[01:20:01.280 --> 01:20:02.480]   Look at all those new tweets.
[01:20:02.480 --> 01:20:03.960]   Look at all the new tweets.
[01:20:03.960 --> 01:20:06.360]   Use tweet tweet about the that's good.
[01:20:06.360 --> 01:20:07.360]   Yeah.
[01:20:07.360 --> 01:20:09.720]   What the hell Leo said Mythbusters is in science.
[01:20:09.720 --> 01:20:11.720]   I see now they're telling Jamie.
[01:20:11.720 --> 01:20:12.720]   See that's what happened.
[01:20:12.720 --> 01:20:13.720]   That's what happened.
[01:20:13.720 --> 01:20:14.720]   Once again.
[01:20:14.720 --> 01:20:15.720]   That's what happened.
[01:20:15.720 --> 01:20:19.680]   They're they're they're they're taddling on me and now Jamie thinks I'm saying bad stuff
[01:20:19.680 --> 01:20:20.680]   and then all of a sudden.
[01:20:20.680 --> 01:20:22.720]   Sweet to Adam and then we'll just really make a mess.
[01:20:22.720 --> 01:20:23.720]   Oh man.
[01:20:23.720 --> 01:20:25.360]   I called it and they were they are going to come up here.
[01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:26.360]   Good.
[01:20:26.360 --> 01:20:27.360]   Good.
[01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:28.360]   We've been trying to get him on for a long time.
[01:20:28.360 --> 01:20:31.720]   Oh I see your game here.
[01:20:31.720 --> 01:20:35.920]   Actually Kevin Spacey said he would come on triangulation right before season two of
[01:20:35.920 --> 01:20:36.920]   hearts.
[01:20:36.920 --> 01:20:37.920]   Nice.
[01:20:37.920 --> 01:20:38.920]   Very cool.
[01:20:38.920 --> 01:20:39.920]   Kevin's cool.
[01:20:39.920 --> 01:20:42.080]   He's kind of a gadget here.
[01:20:42.080 --> 01:20:43.680]   Our show today brought to you by stamps.com.
[01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:45.560]   I bet you Kevin Spacey uses stamps.com.
[01:20:45.560 --> 01:20:47.560]   At least he would if he had a lot of mailing to do.
[01:20:47.560 --> 01:20:49.600]   He probably doesn't have a lot of mailing.
[01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:52.760]   It wouldn't really be good if you just you know wanted a mail postcard once in a while.
[01:20:52.760 --> 01:20:56.520]   But if you're in the business like you're at Etsy seller or an eBay seller.
[01:20:56.520 --> 01:21:01.720]   If you said if your business sends out mailers, flyers, invoices, you shouldn't be going to
[01:21:01.720 --> 01:21:06.200]   the post office to buy postage and you really shouldn't be using a postage meter.
[01:21:06.200 --> 01:21:11.520]   You know postage meter ink is a hundred times more expensive than ink jet ink, which is already
[01:21:11.520 --> 01:21:14.040]   a hundred times more expensive than blood.
[01:21:14.040 --> 01:21:16.540]   So don't.
[01:21:16.540 --> 01:21:17.640]   That's science by the way.
[01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:18.640]   That's science.
[01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:21.440]   So don't be doing the postage meter.
[01:21:21.440 --> 01:21:22.680]   Just be doing stamps.com.
[01:21:22.680 --> 01:21:27.760]   It lets you buy and print official US postage with your computer, your printer, no special
[01:21:27.760 --> 01:21:30.680]   ink needed stamps whenever you need it.
[01:21:30.680 --> 01:21:31.840]   You never have to go to the post office.
[01:21:31.840 --> 01:21:37.060]   I mean never because everything you do at the post office, you can do it stamps.com.
[01:21:37.060 --> 01:21:38.680]   You can print right on the envelope.
[01:21:38.680 --> 01:21:39.680]   So your logo is there.
[01:21:39.680 --> 01:21:40.680]   Your return address.
[01:21:40.680 --> 01:21:45.840]   Your address of the recipient from your address book, from QuickBooks, from Etsy Amazon, eBay,
[01:21:45.840 --> 01:21:48.040]   PayPal, you know, it just, it could suck that right up.
[01:21:48.040 --> 01:21:51.320]   If you're doing international mailing, fills out the forms for you.
[01:21:51.320 --> 01:21:57.560]   In fact, we asked people how they're using stamps.com and Veronica Lucas, no relation.
[01:21:57.560 --> 01:22:01.280]   No relation.
[01:22:01.280 --> 01:22:04.960]   She has a business called Poppets, pockets.
[01:22:04.960 --> 01:22:09.360]   They make reusable cloth items or usable cloth diapers, that kind of thing.
[01:22:09.360 --> 01:22:10.800]   Do a lot of international mailing.
[01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:14.240]   She said before she used stamps.com, it was such a pain for her.
[01:22:14.240 --> 01:22:16.720]   She filling out forms, waiting in line, whatever.
[01:22:16.720 --> 01:22:18.000]   She had a ship to Canada.
[01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:19.160]   She had a lot of customers at Canada.
[01:22:19.160 --> 01:22:20.160]   It was a real pain.
[01:22:20.160 --> 01:22:21.680]   She heard us talking about stamps.com.
[01:22:21.680 --> 01:22:23.720]   She actually heard about it on the show.
[01:22:23.720 --> 01:22:27.720]   She says shipping to Canada is the reason we started using stamps.com and the reason we
[01:22:27.720 --> 01:22:30.160]   continue to use it every time we ship.
[01:22:30.160 --> 01:22:33.400]   The customs forms are simplified at my door, pick up.
[01:22:33.400 --> 01:22:34.400]   It's awesome.
[01:22:34.400 --> 01:22:35.560]   It's awesome for you to.
[01:22:35.560 --> 01:22:36.560]   Here's the deal.
[01:22:36.560 --> 01:22:42.800]   The stamps.com right now and get a very special $110 bonus offer includes $55 in free postage
[01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:43.800]   coupons.
[01:22:43.800 --> 01:22:46.360]   You can use those over the first month or two of your stamps.com.
[01:22:46.360 --> 01:22:48.800]   I think it's like over several months.
[01:22:48.800 --> 01:22:51.720]   You also get the really great digital scale.
[01:22:51.720 --> 01:22:52.720]   You get a supply kit.
[01:22:52.720 --> 01:22:53.720]   Now here's the key though.
[01:22:53.720 --> 01:22:56.960]   Click the microphone at stamps.com in the upper right hand corner and enter our offer
[01:22:56.960 --> 01:22:57.960]   code TWIT.
[01:22:57.960 --> 01:23:04.280]   The $80 value on the front page turns into that $110 bonus value, including a four week
[01:23:04.280 --> 01:23:06.240]   free trial of stamps.com.
[01:23:06.240 --> 01:23:07.560]   You got to try it.
[01:23:07.560 --> 01:23:08.960]   You're going to love it.
[01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:09.960]   Stamps.com.
[01:23:09.960 --> 01:23:12.720]   Then the mail carrier comes to you.
[01:23:12.720 --> 01:23:13.720]   They pick it up.
[01:23:13.720 --> 01:23:15.480]   You never have to go to the post office again.
[01:23:15.480 --> 01:23:19.440]   I see people waiting in line at the post office or the postage meter and I just think why.
[01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:21.400]   I had to mail something to the Netherlands.
[01:23:21.400 --> 01:23:23.440]   It's a lot of stuff, right?
[01:23:23.440 --> 01:23:24.440]   I didn't know what to do.
[01:23:24.440 --> 01:23:25.440]   I had to bring it to post office.
[01:23:25.440 --> 01:23:27.240]   You had to get international mailing thing.
[01:23:27.240 --> 01:23:28.240]   Yeah.
[01:23:28.240 --> 01:23:31.240]   Well, if you have to do that more than a few times a year, you should probably get something.
[01:23:31.240 --> 01:23:32.240]   Yeah, I don't really.
[01:23:32.240 --> 01:23:33.240]   Yeah, that's the thing.
[01:23:33.240 --> 01:23:34.240]   Most people.
[01:23:34.240 --> 01:23:35.240]   It's not like a big deal.
[01:23:35.240 --> 01:23:38.320]   Mark Zuckerberg says, "What is he doing?
[01:23:38.320 --> 01:23:39.600]   I don't understand it even.
[01:23:39.600 --> 01:23:42.520]   He says Internet should be easier or something.
[01:23:42.520 --> 01:23:44.080]   Should be easier?
[01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:47.200]   There should be lower barriers to Internet access.
[01:23:47.200 --> 01:23:49.200]   Oh, access.
[01:23:49.200 --> 01:23:55.480]   So Mark says, "But one in seven people in the world use Facebook, but there are four
[01:23:55.480 --> 01:23:58.680]   billion people who lack Internet access.
[01:23:58.680 --> 01:23:59.680]   Therefore..."
[01:23:59.680 --> 01:24:00.680]   More people need to be on Facebook.
[01:24:00.680 --> 01:24:04.520]   They need $20 smartphones is what they need.
[01:24:04.520 --> 01:24:08.960]   On Wednesday, Facebook announced an effort aimed at drastically cutting the cost of basic
[01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:13.720]   Internet on mobile in developing countries where Facebook needs to find users.
[01:24:13.720 --> 01:24:15.280]   There's a little pink video.
[01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:21.400]   Just replace every instance of Internet on this post with Facebook and you have the accurate
[01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:24.360]   idea what Zuckerberg is going for.
[01:24:24.360 --> 01:24:26.360]   Yeah.
[01:24:26.360 --> 01:24:33.000]   He does have a coalition of other companies who want to join him with this, even Internet.org.
[01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:34.680]   Actually, that's the website, isn't it?
[01:24:34.680 --> 01:24:36.440]   We're looking at it right now, Internet.org.
[01:24:36.440 --> 01:24:37.440]   How do you get that?
[01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:39.280]   How do you get that?
[01:24:39.280 --> 01:24:44.520]   How did the guy with tens of billions of dollars get a domain name?
[01:24:44.520 --> 01:24:47.680]   If you were really wealthy, how would you get a domain name?
[01:24:47.680 --> 01:24:51.280]   How would you do that?
[01:24:51.280 --> 01:24:56.040]   So this isn't Project Loon, which is Google's somewhat loony idea, put balloons up in the
[01:24:56.040 --> 01:24:58.120]   stratosphere with Internet access.
[01:24:58.120 --> 01:25:00.920]   Well, at least that idea is an idea.
[01:25:00.920 --> 01:25:03.920]   This is like a mission statement.
[01:25:03.920 --> 01:25:04.920]   What are they doing?
[01:25:04.920 --> 01:25:05.920]   Right.
[01:25:05.920 --> 01:25:06.920]   At least Google has a plan.
[01:25:06.920 --> 01:25:07.920]   All right.
[01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:08.920]   We're going to try and put some balloons in there.
[01:25:08.920 --> 01:25:14.080]   Well, at least this is, you know, he's got actual companies helping him here.
[01:25:14.080 --> 01:25:17.400]   The immediate goals, according to the New York Times, of the new coalition are to cut
[01:25:17.400 --> 01:25:22.080]   the cost of providing mobile Internet services to 1% of its current level.
[01:25:22.080 --> 01:25:24.400]   Wow, that'd be a big cost cutting.
[01:25:24.400 --> 01:25:28.560]   Within five to 10 years, improving by improving the efficiency of networks and mobile phone
[01:25:28.560 --> 01:25:29.560]   software.
[01:25:29.560 --> 01:25:30.560]   Mark puts up.
[01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:33.280]   He puts a few billion into this for research and development.
[01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:34.840]   I can see this could happen.
[01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:37.000]   And it's certainly in his interest as it is.
[01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.520]   You know, let's face it, Google's not being completely altruistic.
[01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:41.320]   Project Loon is about people using...
[01:25:41.320 --> 01:25:42.320]   Sure.
[01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:43.320]   Yeah, they all are.
[01:25:43.320 --> 01:25:44.320]   They all are.
[01:25:44.320 --> 01:25:45.320]   But it's fine.
[01:25:45.320 --> 01:25:46.320]   Yeah.
[01:25:46.320 --> 01:25:47.320]   It's fine.
[01:25:47.320 --> 01:25:52.280]   This world allows for scenarios where the interests of big Internet companies and the
[01:25:52.280 --> 01:25:54.160]   interests of users are aligned.
[01:25:54.160 --> 01:25:55.160]   Which is great.
[01:25:55.160 --> 01:25:56.160]   And it's fine.
[01:25:56.160 --> 01:25:58.600]   I don't mind that at all.
[01:25:58.600 --> 01:26:05.760]   Facebook is already trying to get its Android mobile app down from its current 12 megabytes
[01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:08.760]   a day to one megabyte a day.
[01:26:08.760 --> 01:26:09.760]   That would be nice.
[01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:10.760]   Are you tweeting?
[01:26:10.760 --> 01:26:11.760]   Yes.
[01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:12.760]   Tell Grant and Adam and what?
[01:26:12.760 --> 01:26:17.560]   Brian Brushwood is upset that we called him old.
[01:26:17.560 --> 01:26:18.560]   He's only in his...
[01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:22.360]   I'm trying to explain the joke to him in real time.
[01:26:22.360 --> 01:26:26.080]   This is why the white Twitter anymore, because it doesn't have any nuance, right?
[01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:27.800]   People tweet this stuff.
[01:26:27.800 --> 01:26:31.240]   And you don't hear the smile in my face.
[01:26:31.240 --> 01:26:32.240]   Brushwood, you look great.
[01:26:32.240 --> 01:26:33.240]   Don't worry about it.
[01:26:33.240 --> 01:26:34.880]   Brian, you're a beautiful man.
[01:26:34.880 --> 01:26:37.440]   I want to just run my fingers through your spiked hair.
[01:26:37.440 --> 01:26:38.960]   It doesn't have the spiked hair anymore.
[01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:39.960]   Even better.
[01:26:39.960 --> 01:26:40.960]   Okay.
[01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:45.440]   So I have to say the first thing I do is take Facebook off my mobile phone because it is
[01:26:45.440 --> 01:26:47.360]   a battery hog.
[01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:48.360]   It kills battery life.
[01:26:48.360 --> 01:26:49.920]   I'm not going to leave it open.
[01:26:49.920 --> 01:26:51.120]   No, even if you...
[01:26:51.120 --> 01:26:52.680]   Oh.
[01:26:52.680 --> 01:26:54.200]   Even if you don't leave it open, it's always checking.
[01:26:54.200 --> 01:26:55.200]   Oh, true.
[01:26:55.200 --> 01:26:56.200]   Yeah.
[01:26:56.200 --> 01:26:57.200]   So you have to go...
[01:26:57.200 --> 01:26:58.640]   In the app, you say, "Don't ever update.
[01:26:58.640 --> 01:26:59.640]   Don't ever sink.
[01:26:59.640 --> 01:27:00.640]   Don't ever refresh.
[01:27:00.640 --> 01:27:01.640]   Don't ever notify."
[01:27:01.640 --> 01:27:02.640]   And it's still down.
[01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:04.240]   It was 12 megabytes a day.
[01:27:04.240 --> 01:27:05.440]   It's terrible.
[01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:06.440]   So they could fix that.
[01:27:06.440 --> 01:27:07.440]   Thank you, Mark.
[01:27:07.440 --> 01:27:10.080]   That would be a good start.
[01:27:10.080 --> 01:27:12.280]   You know, I'm all for this.
[01:27:12.280 --> 01:27:16.560]   Mobile is the future of internet in a lot of these countries, that's for sure.
[01:27:16.560 --> 01:27:19.520]   Nokia's involved in this, of course.
[01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:22.200]   I don't know.
[01:27:22.200 --> 01:27:25.920]   It's not Bill Gates' level philanthropy, but it's some.
[01:27:25.920 --> 01:27:29.640]   Microsoft's giving free surface RT tablets to classrooms.
[01:27:29.640 --> 01:27:30.640]   That's cool.
[01:27:30.640 --> 01:27:31.640]   That's great.
[01:27:31.640 --> 01:27:33.160]   Yeah, they got to do something like that.
[01:27:33.160 --> 01:27:35.000]   We got a few extras in the warehouse.
[01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:36.000]   Sit to the warehouse.
[01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:37.000]   Totally.
[01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:38.400]   Actually, RT, I think, is probably a good thing for the class.
[01:27:38.400 --> 01:27:39.400]   We've got office on it.
[01:27:39.400 --> 01:27:41.440]   It's all you need.
[01:27:41.440 --> 01:27:44.600]   And they're giving them ad-free Bing.
[01:27:44.600 --> 01:27:46.040]   Which sounds like a drug of some.
[01:27:46.040 --> 01:27:47.040]   Oh, good.
[01:27:47.040 --> 01:27:48.040]   What's ad-free Bing?
[01:27:48.040 --> 01:27:50.200]   Hey, kid, you want some ad-free Bing?
[01:27:50.200 --> 01:27:54.800]   That's what the kids are smoking these days is Bing.
[01:27:54.800 --> 01:27:58.240]   Bing for schools is a new ad.
[01:27:58.240 --> 01:28:00.360]   And this is episode 4.
[01:28:00.360 --> 01:28:02.280]   Do you have Grumpy Cat on your desktop?
[01:28:02.280 --> 01:28:04.280]   How did you see that?
[01:28:04.280 --> 01:28:06.960]   So, who's the one Grumpy Cat?
[01:28:06.960 --> 01:28:07.960]   He's cute.
[01:28:07.960 --> 01:28:09.600]   Is it Little Bubber Grumpy Cat?
[01:28:09.600 --> 01:28:10.600]   It's Grumpy Cat.
[01:28:10.600 --> 01:28:11.600]   Okay.
[01:28:11.600 --> 01:28:12.600]   Bing in a bong.
[01:28:12.600 --> 01:28:13.600]   Bing in a bong.
[01:28:13.600 --> 01:28:15.760]   Bing for schools is a new ad-free version of Microsoft Search.
[01:28:15.760 --> 01:28:19.240]   It includes strict filtering and privacy protections designed for schools.
[01:28:19.240 --> 01:28:20.240]   You need to do that.
[01:28:20.240 --> 01:28:22.080]   800,000 students are going to have it.
[01:28:22.080 --> 01:28:26.160]   Remember, I think that Microsoft lost a very big buy when LA's school district has spent
[01:28:26.160 --> 01:28:27.160]   $30 million on iPads.
[01:28:27.160 --> 01:28:29.160]   I don't know how they got that one in.
[01:28:29.160 --> 01:28:30.560]   Yeah, I wouldn't have saved them, though.
[01:28:30.560 --> 01:28:31.560]   No.
[01:28:31.560 --> 01:28:35.320]   Remember, $900 million is how much they wrote down on Surface.
[01:28:35.320 --> 01:28:36.320]   Unbelievable.
[01:28:36.320 --> 01:28:39.640]   It wouldn't even be gone to take a dent in that.
[01:28:39.640 --> 01:28:41.160]   Make a dent in that.
[01:28:41.160 --> 01:28:46.040]   Classrooms can earn free tablets for using Bing.
[01:28:46.040 --> 01:28:50.200]   Classrooms, teachers, parents, anyone can use the Bing Rewards program to collect credits
[01:28:50.200 --> 01:28:53.040]   towards free Surface RT tablets for schools.
[01:28:53.040 --> 01:28:56.840]   You get a Surface RT when you reach 30,000 credits.
[01:28:56.840 --> 01:29:01.120]   That's the equivalent of about 60 Bing users using the service regularly for a month.
[01:29:01.120 --> 01:29:04.840]   So if you get all the parents in a school to use Bing, this is a good marketing idea.
[01:29:04.840 --> 01:29:08.000]   The problem is nobody wants to use Bing.
[01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:09.000]   Really?
[01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000]   This is what it's come to.
[01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:12.880]   You know, I have to use Bing.
[01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:17.880]   It's basically Girl Scout cookies for internet service.
[01:29:17.880 --> 01:29:18.880]   Why are you using Bing?
[01:29:18.880 --> 01:29:19.880]   Yeah, but it's a people actually want Girl Scout.
[01:29:19.880 --> 01:29:21.880]   I want Girl Scout cookies.
[01:29:21.880 --> 01:29:22.880]   Almer.
[01:29:22.880 --> 01:29:24.480]   It's time.
[01:29:24.480 --> 01:29:26.680]   Do you like the, which ones do you like?
[01:29:26.680 --> 01:29:27.680]   Do you like?
[01:29:27.680 --> 01:29:28.680]   I like them.
[01:29:28.680 --> 01:29:29.680]   Yeah.
[01:29:29.680 --> 01:29:30.680]   The mints?
[01:29:30.680 --> 01:29:31.680]   No, no, no.
[01:29:31.680 --> 01:29:32.680]   That's a good thing.
[01:29:32.680 --> 01:29:33.680]   That's a good thing.
[01:29:33.680 --> 01:29:35.680]   What do they call the tag along?
[01:29:35.680 --> 01:29:36.680]   Tag the tag.
[01:29:36.680 --> 01:29:37.680]   What are the coconut ones?
[01:29:37.680 --> 01:29:38.680]   Yeah.
[01:29:38.680 --> 01:29:39.680]   That one.
[01:29:39.680 --> 01:29:40.680]   What's that one?
[01:29:40.680 --> 01:29:41.680]   Tag along.
[01:29:41.680 --> 01:29:42.680]   Smell us.
[01:29:42.680 --> 01:29:43.680]   Smell us.
[01:29:43.680 --> 01:29:44.680]   But no, they get different names.
[01:29:44.680 --> 01:29:45.680]   No, they don't.
[01:29:45.680 --> 01:29:46.680]   So like in the East Coast, it's something else.
[01:29:46.680 --> 01:29:47.680]   No.
[01:29:47.680 --> 01:29:48.680]   What's it?
[01:29:48.680 --> 01:29:49.680]   It is.
[01:29:49.680 --> 01:29:50.680]   It's Austin.
[01:29:50.680 --> 01:29:52.200]   I was a Girl Scout and I didn't even know that.
[01:29:52.200 --> 01:29:56.800]   And it's called Smellas in the West Coast and I don't know where else.
[01:29:56.800 --> 01:30:01.280]   I thought there was Smellas when I was a kid though and I was on the East Coast.
[01:30:01.280 --> 01:30:02.280]   There's different companies make them.
[01:30:02.280 --> 01:30:03.280]   Oh, okay.
[01:30:03.280 --> 01:30:04.280]   But it's the same.
[01:30:04.280 --> 01:30:05.280]   Alright.
[01:30:05.280 --> 01:30:06.280]   It's caramel delights.
[01:30:06.280 --> 01:30:07.280]   What's the peanut butter ones?
[01:30:07.280 --> 01:30:08.280]   Mmm.
[01:30:08.280 --> 01:30:09.280]   That's the ones.
[01:30:09.280 --> 01:30:10.280]   I like those.
[01:30:10.280 --> 01:30:11.280]   Those are good.
[01:30:11.280 --> 01:30:12.280]   Were you a Girl Scout too?
[01:30:12.280 --> 01:30:13.280]   Yeah, she knows.
[01:30:13.280 --> 01:30:14.280]   Girl.
[01:30:14.280 --> 01:30:15.280]   Where?
[01:30:15.280 --> 01:30:16.280]   Scout.
[01:30:16.280 --> 01:30:20.000]   No, that's the boys.
[01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:21.000]   What do the girls do?
[01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:22.000]   I don't remember.
[01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:23.000]   No, the girls do the same thing.
[01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:24.000]   We have the boys.
[01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:25.000]   You don't do a salute.
[01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:26.000]   The three-finger salute.
[01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:27.000]   No.
[01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:28.000]   No.
[01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:29.000]   No.
[01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:30.000]   No.
[01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:31.000]   Cub Scouts do the two-finger salute.
[01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:32.000]   Wow.
[01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:33.000]   Don't ask.
[01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:34.000]   I'm sorry.
[01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:35.000]   Oh, we're both like, whatever.
[01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:36.000]   There they are.
[01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:37.000]   Okay.
[01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:38.000]   Keep subtracting me.
[01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:39.000]   So one is Samoas and one is caramel delights.
[01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:40.000]   I'm the left caramel delights.
[01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:41.400]   On the right, Samoas.
[01:30:41.400 --> 01:30:42.400]   There's a slight difference.
[01:30:42.400 --> 01:30:44.000]   Samoas have chocolate.
[01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.240]   I ate so many Samoas one time I threw up.
[01:30:46.240 --> 01:30:47.240]   And that was like last year.
[01:30:47.240 --> 01:30:48.240]   That must have been pretty.
[01:30:48.240 --> 01:30:49.240]   Wow.
[01:30:49.240 --> 01:30:50.240]   That was like recently.
[01:30:50.240 --> 01:30:51.240]   My last year, really?
[01:30:51.240 --> 01:30:52.240]   Yeah.
[01:30:52.240 --> 01:30:53.240]   When I saw Samoas.
[01:30:53.240 --> 01:30:54.240]   Yeah, I'm pretty.
[01:30:54.240 --> 01:30:56.240]   No, I don't remember that.
[01:30:56.240 --> 01:30:57.240]   And he's still married.
[01:30:57.240 --> 01:30:58.920]   Are you sure that wasn't at work or something?
[01:30:58.920 --> 01:30:59.920]   It was not at work.
[01:30:59.920 --> 01:31:00.920]   No, it was.
[01:31:00.920 --> 01:31:03.840]   I ate them all during the day and then like two hours later, I was like, did you really,
[01:31:03.840 --> 01:31:04.840]   you got sick?
[01:31:04.840 --> 01:31:05.840]   Yeah, I got really sick.
[01:31:05.840 --> 01:31:06.840]   How many Samoas?
[01:31:06.840 --> 01:31:08.840]   It's made up in here.
[01:31:08.840 --> 01:31:09.840]   No, it was-
[01:31:09.840 --> 01:31:10.840]   It might have been.
[01:31:10.840 --> 01:31:11.840]   We often fly.
[01:31:11.840 --> 01:31:14.640]   We often play our guests with a Girl Scout cookies.
[01:31:14.640 --> 01:31:18.240]   I can't remember where I got the Girl Scout cookies from, but it was intense.
[01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:20.440]   I don't recommend binging on Girl Scouts.
[01:31:20.440 --> 01:31:21.440]   It was intense?
[01:31:21.440 --> 01:31:24.440]   It was intense because you're Girl Scouts.
[01:31:24.440 --> 01:31:25.440]   Intense?
[01:31:25.440 --> 01:31:27.440]   They like your camping.
[01:31:27.440 --> 01:31:28.440]   Yeah, I get it.
[01:31:28.440 --> 01:31:29.440]   Like because you're camping.
[01:31:29.440 --> 01:31:30.440]   This is the bad joke.
[01:31:30.440 --> 01:31:31.440]   All right.
[01:31:31.440 --> 01:31:32.440]   It's enough wine for me.
[01:31:32.440 --> 01:31:33.440]   All right.
[01:31:33.440 --> 01:31:34.440]   Pull it together, people.
[01:31:34.440 --> 01:31:36.440]   We got a show to do.
[01:31:36.440 --> 01:31:37.440]   Sorry, Leo.
[01:31:37.440 --> 01:31:39.720]   I love a pun.
[01:31:39.720 --> 01:31:40.720]   Let's take a break.
[01:31:40.720 --> 01:31:41.960]   What do you say?
[01:31:41.960 --> 01:31:44.480]   And see what you missed.
[01:31:44.480 --> 01:31:48.400]   I know you're enjoying this show, but if you happen to have tuned in earlier, this is what
[01:31:48.400 --> 01:31:50.320]   you might have missed.
[01:31:50.320 --> 01:31:53.840]   Previously on Twit, this week in YouTube.
[01:31:53.840 --> 01:31:58.240]   Do you think that this is worrying people at YouTube that gamers are the ones who are
[01:31:58.240 --> 01:31:59.240]   rising?
[01:31:59.240 --> 01:32:00.240]   I mean, we've seen-
[01:32:00.240 --> 01:32:01.240]   Oh!
[01:32:01.240 --> 01:32:03.240]   I didn't mean to take a step on this one.
[01:32:03.240 --> 01:32:05.240]   That's why I asked more about it.
[01:32:05.240 --> 01:32:06.240]   Twit Live Special.
[01:32:06.240 --> 01:32:11.680]   A couple of people in the chat room have wondered if Balmer is going to stay around at Microsoft
[01:32:11.680 --> 01:32:12.680]   in any capacity.
[01:32:12.680 --> 01:32:16.720]   When I talked to him, he said, "I haven't had time to even think about what I want to
[01:32:16.720 --> 01:32:17.720]   do."
[01:32:17.720 --> 01:32:20.000]   But using his own words against him, he said this has been going on for years.
[01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.680]   We're suggesting that he hasn't thought about this at all.
[01:32:22.680 --> 01:32:26.720]   I mean, you know, who doesn't think about the future and about how things might change
[01:32:26.720 --> 01:32:29.600]   and what that future might look like for them?
[01:32:29.600 --> 01:32:30.600]   This week in Google.
[01:32:30.600 --> 01:32:33.520]   Folk did an article on Marissa Meyer.
[01:32:33.520 --> 01:32:36.520]   They did a great-looking picture of her in a designer dress.
[01:32:36.520 --> 01:32:39.120]   And people say, "Oh, it overshadows the story."
[01:32:39.120 --> 01:32:40.120]   And I don't think so.
[01:32:40.120 --> 01:32:41.120]   It's a unicorn thing.
[01:32:41.120 --> 01:32:46.800]   You're just not used to seeing young, email CEOs like in the position that she's in.
[01:32:46.800 --> 01:32:51.600]   Which, by the way, I recreated on Twitter myself because I have that couch and that is
[01:32:51.600 --> 01:32:53.600]   a really tough one.
[01:32:53.600 --> 01:32:54.600]   That's amazing.
[01:32:54.600 --> 01:32:55.600]   That is amazing.
[01:32:55.600 --> 01:32:58.600]   Any cell of a journalist's picture of your cat.
[01:32:58.600 --> 01:32:59.600]   Oh, Lucy.
[01:32:59.600 --> 01:33:00.600]   That is the weirdest.
[01:33:00.600 --> 01:33:01.600]   What's wrong with her eyes?
[01:33:01.600 --> 01:33:02.600]   Lucy.
[01:33:02.600 --> 01:33:03.600]   She was high.
[01:33:03.600 --> 01:33:04.600]   That is scary.
[01:33:04.600 --> 01:33:11.600]   Have you ever done that?
[01:33:11.600 --> 01:33:12.600]   Lazed over?
[01:33:12.600 --> 01:33:14.600]   She was staring at the wall.
[01:33:14.600 --> 01:33:18.280]   Yeah, our cat Devo does that a lot.
[01:33:18.280 --> 01:33:20.680]   That was a really funny picture of the kid.
[01:33:20.680 --> 01:33:21.680]   Of the kid.
[01:33:21.680 --> 01:33:22.680]   Oh, Danny Sullivan.
[01:33:22.680 --> 01:33:23.680]   That's real journalism.
[01:33:23.680 --> 01:33:24.680]   I just can't believe I went out there.
[01:33:24.680 --> 01:33:25.680]   I have a couch too.
[01:33:25.680 --> 01:33:29.120]   Who wouldn't have tried to recreate that if they had that couch?
[01:33:29.120 --> 01:33:30.120]   Absolutely.
[01:33:30.120 --> 01:33:32.600]   It doesn't look like a comfortable position she's in.
[01:33:32.600 --> 01:33:35.400]   I liked the profile very much in Vogue.
[01:33:35.400 --> 01:33:36.400]   Actually, I just read it.
[01:33:36.400 --> 01:33:40.200]   I also read the Business Insider article that Nicholas Carlson did was amazing.
[01:33:40.200 --> 01:33:41.200]   She's very interested.
[01:33:41.200 --> 01:33:44.000]   It's long but highly recommend reading it because it was just fantastic.
[01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:45.000]   What did he say about it?
[01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:54.760]   I mean, it was a lot of first person accounts of her kind of rise to CEO of Yahoo.
[01:33:54.760 --> 01:33:59.680]   It goes back and forth between a lot of people think she's a very cold, very kind of calculating
[01:33:59.680 --> 01:34:00.680]   person.
[01:34:00.680 --> 01:34:01.680]   She's very shy.
[01:34:01.680 --> 01:34:08.640]   But a lot of people say that when she's very good at her job and she's not a cold.
[01:34:08.640 --> 01:34:11.200]   She's an introvert is what she is.
[01:34:11.200 --> 01:34:13.360]   She's not an ice princess.
[01:34:13.360 --> 01:34:14.360]   You know, it's funny.
[01:34:14.360 --> 01:34:18.000]   I've met her and she's shy.
[01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:19.000]   She's shy.
[01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.880]   She kind of doesn't know really what to say.
[01:34:21.880 --> 01:34:23.880]   You expect somebody.
[01:34:23.880 --> 01:34:30.280]   There's a new biography, which I don't know if I'll read the unauthorized biography.
[01:34:30.280 --> 01:34:34.000]   She was talking about or yeah, it is.
[01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:35.640]   Nicholas Carlson and Business Insider.
[01:34:35.640 --> 01:34:38.120]   Yeah, it's great.
[01:34:38.120 --> 01:34:41.280]   I think people don't expect a CEO to be an introvert.
[01:34:41.280 --> 01:34:43.880]   And I think she is a little shy.
[01:34:43.880 --> 01:34:47.680]   Well, apparently once you get her talking though, she especially about stuff she's passionate
[01:34:47.680 --> 01:34:52.520]   about, which is usually the consumer facing side of things, the customer experience.
[01:34:52.520 --> 01:34:54.000]   I think that's really where she shines.
[01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:58.840]   And that's why people were worried about promoting her to CEO of Yahoo or bringing her in as
[01:34:58.840 --> 01:35:05.760]   CEO because they wanted someone who was very ingrained in the corporate mythos, you know,
[01:35:05.760 --> 01:35:09.400]   who kind of knew how to run a business from that point of view from the business point
[01:35:09.400 --> 01:35:12.360]   of things, which she kind of stayed out of at Google.
[01:35:12.360 --> 01:35:16.600]   So now she always kind of paid more attention to the experience for users.
[01:35:16.600 --> 01:35:17.600]   So I think that's actually-
[01:35:17.600 --> 01:35:18.600]   That's how I would say.
[01:35:18.600 --> 01:35:19.600]   I would take that any day.
[01:35:19.600 --> 01:35:27.920]   I would take somebody who's quiet and cares deeply about user experience over Monkey Boy
[01:35:27.920 --> 01:35:28.920]   who doesn't care at all about that.
[01:35:28.920 --> 01:35:32.800]   Well, that's why the board was so divided on that decision because half of the board
[01:35:32.800 --> 01:35:36.680]   really wanted someone like her to come in and kind of shake things up.
[01:35:36.680 --> 01:35:41.200]   And the other half was not interested in that kind of CEO.
[01:35:41.200 --> 01:35:46.560]   Yeah, it was Dan Lobe who was really a contrarian and an activist investor who said, you know,
[01:35:46.560 --> 01:35:49.560]   you've got to get somebody good in here.
[01:35:49.560 --> 01:35:56.360]   And you know, I think while it's too early to say she's succeeded, it looks good.
[01:35:56.360 --> 01:36:01.720]   Yahoo, for the first time this month, beat Google in the number of impressions.
[01:36:01.720 --> 01:36:04.120]   First time in seven years that they've done it.
[01:36:04.120 --> 01:36:07.680]   It no longer seems impossible that they might succeed.
[01:36:07.680 --> 01:36:08.680]   Yeah.
[01:36:08.680 --> 01:36:10.000]   And I don't know about you.
[01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.240]   Maybe it's because I'm an old timer, but I'm rooting for him.
[01:36:12.240 --> 01:36:13.240]   I want him to succeed.
[01:36:13.240 --> 01:36:14.240]   Sure.
[01:36:14.240 --> 01:36:15.240]   Yeah.
[01:36:15.240 --> 01:36:18.000]   Mostly because no great internet brand like that has ever come back from the edge.
[01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:19.000]   It's just never happened.
[01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:24.160]   The thing is, it's so hard for Yahoo in a day where it's so easy for Facebook and Google
[01:36:24.160 --> 01:36:30.560]   to kind of poach really talented, you know, product people and engineers and developers.
[01:36:30.560 --> 01:36:35.120]   And she's kind of making the corporate culture exciting enough that people want to stay now.
[01:36:35.120 --> 01:36:39.400]   She's becoming like, I don't want to say she's becoming their Steve Jobs, but from everything
[01:36:39.400 --> 01:36:46.040]   that I've read, she's kind of starting to get that excitement within the corporation within
[01:36:46.040 --> 01:36:49.440]   the young people who are working there.
[01:36:49.440 --> 01:36:51.520]   They're really excited about her as CEO.
[01:36:51.520 --> 01:36:53.760]   And I think that can only lead to good things.
[01:36:53.760 --> 01:36:54.760]   It is exciting.
[01:36:54.760 --> 01:36:56.720]   Now, this is behind the scenes.
[01:36:56.720 --> 01:37:02.160]   But you fist bumped me when I, we were talking about the picture of her dressed in this beautiful
[01:37:02.160 --> 01:37:07.240]   designer gown and I said, I think that that's fine.
[01:37:07.240 --> 01:37:11.760]   If I had been a male CEO being profiled for Vogue and if he was wearing a great outfit
[01:37:11.760 --> 01:37:16.200]   and if he was, you know, sitting on a couch, I don't think anyone would have said anything.
[01:37:16.200 --> 01:37:17.200]   I don't.
[01:37:17.200 --> 01:37:21.200]   Well, and why should we say that women have to be just like guys?
[01:37:21.200 --> 01:37:23.120]   No, I mean, she cares about fashion.
[01:37:23.120 --> 01:37:24.120]   She loves it.
[01:37:24.120 --> 01:37:25.120]   So what?
[01:37:25.120 --> 01:37:26.200]   You know, she, she gives to charity.
[01:37:26.200 --> 01:37:28.240]   She helps a lot of young entrepreneurs.
[01:37:28.240 --> 01:37:29.600]   She's a great at her job.
[01:37:29.600 --> 01:37:34.000]   I, I don't think people should get their panties in a bunch over it.
[01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.560]   She says I'm not a feminist, but you know what?
[01:37:36.560 --> 01:37:39.640]   She's from a generation that is post-feminist.
[01:37:39.640 --> 01:37:40.640]   Your generation, really.
[01:37:40.640 --> 01:37:44.440]   Well, what I loved about, you know, about that profile especially was, you know, there
[01:37:44.440 --> 01:37:49.720]   was a lot of, she got a lot of hell about, you know, requiring Yahoo employees to come
[01:37:49.720 --> 01:37:52.120]   in, you know, and not work remotely.
[01:37:52.120 --> 01:37:53.120]   Right.
[01:37:53.120 --> 01:37:55.280]   Which was seen as kind of a slap to work at home.
[01:37:55.280 --> 01:37:58.720]   Especially considering she, she was a new mother and, you know, she had the capabilities,
[01:37:58.720 --> 01:38:03.840]   resources to have a full-time nanny to have all the, those resources available to her
[01:38:03.840 --> 01:38:05.160]   24/7.
[01:38:05.160 --> 01:38:08.940]   But she just was like, I just want Yahoo to do better and people do better when they're
[01:38:08.940 --> 01:38:10.360]   here in the office.
[01:38:10.360 --> 01:38:14.280]   And so when you kind of break it down, like she's looking at those, those reasons, she's
[01:38:14.280 --> 01:38:18.560]   not really thinking about the other reasons, which may or may not be a good thing at the
[01:38:18.560 --> 01:38:22.640]   end of the day, but you know, it kind of lets you see how she's what her point of view
[01:38:22.640 --> 01:38:23.640]   is.
[01:38:23.640 --> 01:38:24.640]   I think it was mishandled.
[01:38:24.640 --> 01:38:26.360]   It probably could have been done more privately.
[01:38:26.360 --> 01:38:32.440]   But, you know, as a company owner, I really like to see employees in there.
[01:38:32.440 --> 01:38:35.560]   There's a synergy that happens when employees are talking to one another.
[01:38:35.560 --> 01:38:40.320]   A lot of our people are like Tom, work out of their home in LA and that's something we
[01:38:40.320 --> 01:38:41.320]   have to put up with.
[01:38:41.320 --> 01:38:46.320]   I would far prefer to have them in studio, but just because there's a synergy that happens
[01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:47.920]   when people are all together.
[01:38:47.920 --> 01:38:52.800]   But the nature of this business and the fact that we're in the middle of nowhere requires
[01:38:52.800 --> 01:38:56.080]   that many of our people are in fact not in the same studio.
[01:38:56.080 --> 01:38:57.160]   But I'm a little sympathetic.
[01:38:57.160 --> 01:38:58.160]   I understand why she would want everybody.
[01:38:58.160 --> 01:39:00.040]   I also have a total girl crush on her.
[01:39:00.040 --> 01:39:01.040]   So whatever.
[01:39:01.040 --> 01:39:02.040]   I do too.
[01:39:02.040 --> 01:39:03.040]   I have a girl crush on her.
[01:39:03.040 --> 01:39:04.040]   I think she's great.
[01:39:04.040 --> 01:39:05.040]   Yeah.
[01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:06.040]   She's powerful.
[01:39:06.040 --> 01:39:10.480]   She's 37 and running one of the biggest internet, 38, running one of the biggest internet companies
[01:39:10.480 --> 01:39:11.480]   out there.
[01:39:11.480 --> 01:39:12.480]   Good on her.
[01:39:12.480 --> 01:39:17.240]   She looks great in manelos or whatever she was wearing with those liposins.
[01:39:17.240 --> 01:39:20.640]   She's an Oscar de la Renta girl.
[01:39:20.640 --> 01:39:24.360]   She owns the Oscar de la Renta cardigan in like seven different colors.
[01:39:24.360 --> 01:39:25.360]   La Borta.
[01:39:25.360 --> 01:39:28.360]   I don't really know how to say it.
[01:39:28.360 --> 01:39:29.360]   La Boutin.
[01:39:29.360 --> 01:39:30.360]   La Boutin.
[01:39:30.360 --> 01:39:31.360]   La Boutin.
[01:39:31.360 --> 01:39:34.320]   Let's do the internet like pronounced guys.
[01:39:34.320 --> 01:39:35.320]   Luboutin.
[01:39:35.320 --> 01:39:36.320]   Luboutin.
[01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:37.320]   Luboutin.
[01:39:37.320 --> 01:39:38.320]   Yeah.
[01:39:38.320 --> 01:39:39.320]   Christian Luboutin.
[01:39:39.320 --> 01:39:40.320]   All right.
[01:39:40.320 --> 01:39:41.960]   Enough of that.
[01:39:41.960 --> 01:39:43.760]   That's all the men who are watching are going.
[01:39:43.760 --> 01:39:47.680]   Is he having a seizure?
[01:39:47.680 --> 01:39:51.640]   Yahoo is the number one red property for the first time since May 2011.
[01:39:51.640 --> 01:39:52.760]   So it wasn't seven years.
[01:39:52.760 --> 01:39:55.160]   But still, and it may be meaningless.
[01:39:55.160 --> 01:39:56.520]   I mean, these numbers go up and down.
[01:39:56.520 --> 01:39:58.280]   Maybe it was summer time.
[01:39:58.280 --> 01:40:00.560]   So Google searches were down or whatever.
[01:40:00.560 --> 01:40:03.400]   Well, you know, it certainly didn't help that you took that Google, Leo.
[01:40:03.400 --> 01:40:05.960]   I brought Google down and this is ComScore.
[01:40:05.960 --> 01:40:06.960]   Now, I don't know.
[01:40:06.960 --> 01:40:07.960]   Does ComScore matter?
[01:40:07.960 --> 01:40:09.920]   Is this considered reliable?
[01:40:09.920 --> 01:40:14.640]   I, well, I think for this kind of a metric, it is reliable.
[01:40:14.640 --> 01:40:19.920]   I think in most cases, ComScore is not reliable because it uses a sample based sampling based
[01:40:19.920 --> 01:40:24.960]   metrics collection, which means that they're not really looking.
[01:40:24.960 --> 01:40:25.960]   Not counting every day.
[01:40:25.960 --> 01:40:28.000]   That is not an actual number of visitors.
[01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.880]   That is what they believe the number of visitors to be.
[01:40:30.880 --> 01:40:34.920]   And usually, I mean, I've seen variation of 10 to 20 X in terms of what it actually
[01:40:34.920 --> 01:40:35.920]   is in reality.
[01:40:35.920 --> 01:40:36.920]   Well, yeah.
[01:40:36.920 --> 01:40:41.120]   You've seen actual, you know the actual numbers from sites and compared to what ComScore is
[01:40:41.120 --> 01:40:42.600]   saying.
[01:40:42.600 --> 01:40:47.040]   This does not include Tumblr, which is a number of 38 on the list.
[01:40:47.040 --> 01:40:47.960]   So or something like that.
[01:40:47.960 --> 01:40:54.240]   So if you add 28, so if you add Tumblr's 38 million uniques, then they're pretty strong.
[01:40:54.240 --> 01:40:56.880]   That's, and it shows you the strength of the Tumblr acquisition.
[01:40:56.880 --> 01:41:00.480]   You know, that adds another third or something to the total.
[01:41:00.480 --> 01:41:05.000]   It's interesting that Omallik from Gigaom wrote this scathing article saying like, they've
[01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.520]   got these numbers of web has via ComScore.
[01:41:07.520 --> 01:41:12.440]   But if you look at like their digital ad spend, the point of coming in, it's gone down 3.37%.
[01:41:12.440 --> 01:41:17.160]   It's got like all of their mobile, all of their mobile is gone way down even though they
[01:41:17.160 --> 01:41:18.240]   want to focus on it.
[01:41:18.240 --> 01:41:19.240]   And it's on and on and on.
[01:41:19.240 --> 01:41:22.880]   But he just tries talking about other numbers that they're not performing in and how many
[01:41:22.880 --> 01:41:25.400]   people aren't doing it using them for search, obviously.
[01:41:25.400 --> 01:41:26.400]   How many people aren't using them?
[01:41:26.400 --> 01:41:30.640]   It's a time on our tradition when the numbers are good in one area, you point people to that
[01:41:30.640 --> 01:41:33.000]   area and say, don't pay no attention to those other numbers.
[01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:34.240]   Especially when you're a public company.
[01:41:34.240 --> 01:41:37.280]   Yeah, but good on Omallik for pointing out there's more to it than that.
[01:41:37.280 --> 01:41:38.800]   Facebook's turned around the mobile numbers.
[01:41:38.800 --> 01:41:41.960]   Facebook showed that mobile can, they're succeeding in mobile.
[01:41:41.960 --> 01:41:43.560]   Major area of growth.
[01:41:43.560 --> 01:41:44.560]   And that's important.
[01:41:44.560 --> 01:41:46.400]   So Yahoo has to show everybody has to show that.
[01:41:46.400 --> 01:41:49.600]   Engage it as a show that mobile is where people are getting online now.
[01:41:49.600 --> 01:41:50.600]   That's true.
[01:41:50.600 --> 01:41:54.200]   And it's hard to monetize because ads are different in the mobile space.
[01:41:54.200 --> 01:41:56.240]   The technology is a little more primitive.
[01:41:56.240 --> 01:41:57.240]   Yeah.
[01:41:57.240 --> 01:41:59.760]   Not the mobile technology, but the ad technology is a little more primitive.
[01:41:59.760 --> 01:42:03.240]   Well, and we don't even know if well, banner ads work in a tiny screen like that.
[01:42:03.240 --> 01:42:05.040]   I don't know what the sometimes they do.
[01:42:05.040 --> 01:42:06.480]   Yeah, it's messy.
[01:42:06.480 --> 01:42:07.720]   That's still very early.
[01:42:07.720 --> 01:42:12.080]   That's where there's going to be so much growth in is everyone's going to be more and more.
[01:42:12.080 --> 01:42:13.080]   That's not gross.
[01:42:13.080 --> 01:42:15.160]   That's yeah, you're all right.
[01:42:15.160 --> 01:42:16.160]   You're OK.
[01:42:16.160 --> 01:42:18.120]   I just spilled my water in my laptop.
[01:42:18.120 --> 01:42:19.120]   Don't mind that.
[01:42:19.120 --> 01:42:23.280]   This is a little test of the new Haswell chipset.
[01:42:23.280 --> 01:42:25.160]   The new water resistant chipset.
[01:42:25.160 --> 01:42:30.560]   You know, I do that periodically just to see just to keep the guests on their toes.
[01:42:30.560 --> 01:42:32.840]   But anyways, it's mobile ads.
[01:42:32.840 --> 01:42:36.320]   Mobile ads is where there's going to be billions of dollars made.
[01:42:36.320 --> 01:42:40.720]   And because that's where they've got so many eyeballs and so much opportunity to figure
[01:42:40.720 --> 01:42:41.720]   out how to do it.
[01:42:41.720 --> 01:42:46.320]   Well, internet, this Facebook internet door or initiative is all about mobile, right?
[01:42:46.320 --> 01:42:49.280]   It's not even if you're going to get these four billion people online, they're not going
[01:42:49.280 --> 01:42:51.200]   to be sitting at a desktop computer.
[01:42:51.200 --> 01:42:52.200]   Absolutely.
[01:42:52.200 --> 01:42:53.840]   They're going to be doing it on mobile.
[01:42:53.840 --> 01:42:58.320]   So if you want to if you want to participate in the future, you better make mobile work.
[01:42:58.320 --> 01:42:59.320]   Just mop it into my lap.
[01:42:59.320 --> 01:43:01.320]   I like a little feeling.
[01:43:01.320 --> 01:43:03.560]   Moisture down below.
[01:43:03.560 --> 01:43:04.560]   It's OK.
[01:43:04.560 --> 01:43:05.560]   Just mop it.
[01:43:05.560 --> 01:43:06.560]   I'm wearing depends.
[01:43:06.560 --> 01:43:08.760]   It soaks it right off.
[01:43:08.760 --> 01:43:13.240]   No problem at all.
[01:43:13.240 --> 01:43:14.240]   Astronaut diapers.
[01:43:14.240 --> 01:43:15.240]   Got all the towels.
[01:43:15.240 --> 01:43:16.240]   Hey, you know what?
[01:43:16.240 --> 01:43:17.240]   You do long shows.
[01:43:17.240 --> 01:43:18.240]   You really don't get up.
[01:43:18.240 --> 01:43:19.240]   Really long shows.
[01:43:19.240 --> 01:43:20.600]   It would not surprise me.
[01:43:20.600 --> 01:43:21.600]   I do.
[01:43:21.600 --> 01:43:22.600]   The secret reveals.
[01:43:22.600 --> 01:43:24.600]   Yeah, I just need a catheter.
[01:43:24.600 --> 01:43:26.760]   You ever wondered how that should be on your fact.
[01:43:26.760 --> 01:43:27.760]   Can you try?
[01:43:27.760 --> 01:43:31.000]   How does Leo do four hours at a time?
[01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:32.840]   All right.
[01:43:32.840 --> 01:43:37.280]   Now that I've moistened the ads, let me get them back because I do want to mention
[01:43:37.280 --> 01:43:38.280]   my still not.
[01:43:38.280 --> 01:43:39.280]   Fine advertising.
[01:43:39.280 --> 01:43:40.280]   Where did they go?
[01:43:40.280 --> 01:43:41.840]   Are you drying out the ads?
[01:43:41.840 --> 01:43:43.080]   No, they took the ads.
[01:43:43.080 --> 01:43:46.080]   I think they took the ads to dry them out.
[01:43:46.080 --> 01:43:47.080]   Wrench ad run.
[01:43:47.080 --> 01:43:49.080]   Thank you very much.
[01:43:49.080 --> 01:43:50.080]   Think of the sponsors.
[01:43:50.080 --> 01:43:51.080]   He did.
[01:43:51.080 --> 01:43:52.080]   He took.
[01:43:52.080 --> 01:43:54.520]   Do we have a hair dryer?
[01:43:54.520 --> 01:43:56.280]   Some sort of ad drying utility.
[01:43:56.280 --> 01:43:59.240]   Oh, dry copy.
[01:43:59.240 --> 01:44:00.240]   Look at that.
[01:44:00.240 --> 01:44:03.640]   See, I told you, we have like three people in continuity and now you know what?
[01:44:03.640 --> 01:44:04.640]   You've done this in these days.
[01:44:04.640 --> 01:44:05.640]   Case and ad gets moistened.
[01:44:05.640 --> 01:44:06.640]   This is a professional operation.
[01:44:06.640 --> 01:44:09.440]   Can Mr. LaPorte have a dry ad, please?
[01:44:09.440 --> 01:44:10.440]   Thank you.
[01:44:10.440 --> 01:44:15.000]   Our show today brought to you by GoToMeeting from Citrix.
[01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:18.320]   You know, the people we work with these days, we're just talking about this, are not in
[01:44:18.320 --> 01:44:19.320]   the office.
[01:44:19.320 --> 01:44:20.320]   They're on the go.
[01:44:20.320 --> 01:44:21.320]   They're traveling.
[01:44:21.320 --> 01:44:22.680]   They're all over the place.
[01:44:22.680 --> 01:44:27.920]   Since you can't make clients come in for a client presentation, so to work efficiently,
[01:44:27.920 --> 01:44:32.120]   to keep that strong connection with your team, you got to get some way of meeting that's
[01:44:32.120 --> 01:44:34.320]   like face to face as good as face to face.
[01:44:34.320 --> 01:44:36.640]   We actually use GoToMeeting for all of our meetings.
[01:44:36.640 --> 01:44:39.760]   Even if it's just going to be a phone call, we set up the GoToMeeting is very easy to
[01:44:39.760 --> 01:44:41.640]   do as a click of the mouse.
[01:44:41.640 --> 01:44:42.640]   Send them the link.
[01:44:42.640 --> 01:44:45.400]   That way we can have a phone bridge as part of the GoToMeeting service.
[01:44:45.400 --> 01:44:49.160]   But if I want to show them a screen, a PowerPoint presentation, if we want to collaborate, if
[01:44:49.160 --> 01:44:53.360]   we just want to see their face, because there's built-in HD faces of video conferencing now,
[01:44:53.360 --> 01:44:55.400]   too, it makes such a difference.
[01:44:55.400 --> 01:44:59.840]   It is the way to meet online, to be on the same page literally, to see each other face
[01:44:59.840 --> 01:45:01.960]   to face.
[01:45:01.960 --> 01:45:02.960]   Meetings are so important.
[01:45:02.960 --> 01:45:07.120]   I know teams that actually run GoToMeeting all day so that they can collaborate, and
[01:45:07.120 --> 01:45:08.280]   it's like they're in the same room.
[01:45:08.280 --> 01:45:12.760]   One of the nice things about GoToMeeting is that one flat rate gives you unlimited meetings
[01:45:12.760 --> 01:45:14.680]   as often as you want as long as you want.
[01:45:14.680 --> 01:45:18.760]   I want you to try it free for 30 days, so you can get it on your Mac, on your PC.
[01:45:18.760 --> 01:45:21.680]   They've got free apps for all the mobile platforms.
[01:45:21.680 --> 01:45:23.960]   You can even present from an iPad.
[01:45:23.960 --> 01:45:28.080]   You can be sitting at the pool and just show yourself from the neck up.
[01:45:28.080 --> 01:45:30.080]   No one will know.
[01:45:30.080 --> 01:45:31.080]   No pants.
[01:45:31.080 --> 01:45:35.320]   I'm not wearing any pants right now, thanks to GoToMeeting.
[01:45:35.320 --> 01:45:37.120]   GoToMeeting.com.
[01:45:37.120 --> 01:45:40.600]   Not a joke.
[01:45:40.600 --> 01:45:42.960]   That's why I don't mind when the water goes flying.
[01:45:42.960 --> 01:45:43.960]   GoToMeeting.com.
[01:45:43.960 --> 01:45:46.000]   Get the try at free button, use the promo code TWIT.
[01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:50.600]   Remember to use the promo code TWITS for that 30 day free trial and we'll get credit.
[01:45:50.600 --> 01:45:53.600]   GoToMeeting.com.
[01:45:53.600 --> 01:45:55.960]   You know, credit to Apple.
[01:45:55.960 --> 01:45:58.000]   This machine is still working.
[01:45:58.000 --> 01:45:59.760]   I really poured water.
[01:45:59.760 --> 01:46:01.760]   I thought it was pretty bad when I saw that.
[01:46:01.760 --> 01:46:03.880]   Honestly, I thought that computer was done.
[01:46:03.880 --> 01:46:04.880]   I thought it was died.
[01:46:04.880 --> 01:46:05.880]   I thought we were going to see it.
[01:46:05.880 --> 01:46:06.880]   This is the Aswell one and everything.
[01:46:06.880 --> 01:46:09.680]   You're going to have to dry that off with some rice.
[01:46:09.680 --> 01:46:11.760]   Rice, does that really work the right thing?
[01:46:11.760 --> 01:46:13.760]   Yeah, this really does work.
[01:46:13.760 --> 01:46:17.360]   I think if I just do this and let the water drip out.
[01:46:17.360 --> 01:46:18.720]   I have another idea.
[01:46:18.720 --> 01:46:22.160]   Find a benchmarking tool and just really heat it up.
[01:46:22.160 --> 01:46:23.160]   Oh, yeah.
[01:46:23.160 --> 01:46:24.160]   Yeah.
[01:46:24.160 --> 01:46:25.640]   I've got some crisis on there.
[01:46:25.640 --> 01:46:28.240]   If there's a little sizzling going on.
[01:46:28.240 --> 01:46:30.120]   Well, now I don't know what's next on the show.
[01:46:30.120 --> 01:46:33.200]   So if you want to pick a story, you've got the rundowns in front of you.
[01:46:33.200 --> 01:46:34.200]   My boy.
[01:46:34.200 --> 01:46:35.200]   He's drying out.
[01:46:35.200 --> 01:46:36.400]   I've got a few more minutes.
[01:46:36.400 --> 01:46:37.400]   What does...
[01:46:37.400 --> 01:46:38.400]   I think about Samsung Galaxy gear.
[01:46:38.400 --> 01:46:39.400]   It means you're taking over the prison.
[01:46:39.400 --> 01:46:41.200]   OK, so I have a mega.
[01:46:41.200 --> 01:46:45.720]   I have it in actually something that's in the car.
[01:46:45.720 --> 01:46:50.080]   I actually brought all my phones with me in the car because I'm thinking about buying
[01:46:50.080 --> 01:46:55.560]   a house and I want to see if I can get AT&T or Verizon or Team Mobile or Sprint.
[01:46:55.560 --> 01:46:56.560]   It was better out there.
[01:46:56.560 --> 01:46:57.560]   Do you do that?
[01:46:57.560 --> 01:46:58.560]   Sure you do.
[01:46:58.560 --> 01:47:01.840]   You wouldn't move to a house without first checking to see if you can get broadband.
[01:47:01.840 --> 01:47:02.840]   Well, we have microcell.
[01:47:02.840 --> 01:47:05.040]   I think we take it for granted too because we live in San Francisco.
[01:47:05.040 --> 01:47:06.040]   You live in a city.
[01:47:06.040 --> 01:47:07.040]   You live in a city.
[01:47:07.040 --> 01:47:08.040]   You know, you get out here.
[01:47:08.040 --> 01:47:10.720]   You know, you got sheep and goats, but you may not have Wi-Fi.
[01:47:10.720 --> 01:47:13.680]   There's huge cross-sections in San Francisco that get no service.
[01:47:13.680 --> 01:47:14.680]   I don't understand.
[01:47:14.680 --> 01:47:15.680]   Really?
[01:47:15.680 --> 01:47:16.680]   Oh yeah.
[01:47:16.680 --> 01:47:17.680]   We don't get AT&T in our house.
[01:47:17.680 --> 01:47:21.040]   If we didn't street in like Mission and you go into any of those establishments, it just
[01:47:21.040 --> 01:47:22.040]   doesn't work.
[01:47:22.040 --> 01:47:23.040]   That's...
[01:47:23.040 --> 01:47:24.040]   You know, that's really true.
[01:47:24.040 --> 01:47:27.000]   Walking down the street, it's fine, but the second you go into any of the restaurants on
[01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:28.000]   Valencia...
[01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:29.000]   AT&T is a suck.
[01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:30.000]   Can I just say that?
[01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:31.000]   I just don't like that.
[01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:32.160]   No, I just think they all suck.
[01:47:32.160 --> 01:47:33.520]   They all suck in different places.
[01:47:33.520 --> 01:47:34.520]   Yeah.
[01:47:34.520 --> 01:47:36.000]   Depends on where you are.
[01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:37.000]   I could just go...
[01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:38.000]   Wait, oh!
[01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:39.000]   So bad.
[01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:40.000]   You guys.
[01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:41.000]   I just got me.
[01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:42.000]   I just said a thing.
[01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000]   I'm just going to stop talking.
[01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:47.000]   Usually I say I'm just going to have a show title.
[01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000]   But I do think we have a show title.
[01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:50.560]   It's not even.
[01:47:50.560 --> 01:47:51.560]   Wow.
[01:47:51.560 --> 01:47:53.000]   I got the gear 6.6 inches.
[01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:54.000]   Sorry.
[01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:55.000]   6.6 inches.
[01:47:55.000 --> 01:48:07.120]   It's really big, but then I got a Galaxy Note 8 and put a T-Mobile SIM and it's like,
[01:48:07.120 --> 01:48:11.760]   I want a big phone.
[01:48:11.760 --> 01:48:13.640]   This big.
[01:48:13.640 --> 01:48:16.560]   You might be overselling a little bit later.
[01:48:16.560 --> 01:48:17.560]   Okay.
[01:48:17.560 --> 01:48:21.760]   How big is the screen in that Tesla?
[01:48:21.760 --> 01:48:22.760]   It's like 17 inches.
[01:48:22.760 --> 01:48:23.760]   17 inches.
[01:48:23.760 --> 01:48:26.560]   So you take a 17 inch computer and put it sideways.
[01:48:26.560 --> 01:48:27.960]   I actually don't like that.
[01:48:27.960 --> 01:48:29.480]   That bothers me a little bit.
[01:48:29.480 --> 01:48:30.480]   Why?
[01:48:30.480 --> 01:48:32.960]   It looks oversized and then you get really used to it.
[01:48:32.960 --> 01:48:35.120]   Anything else you're in, you're like, "Why is it so small?"
[01:48:35.120 --> 01:48:36.120]   Right.
[01:48:36.120 --> 01:48:37.120]   Maybe that's it.
[01:48:37.120 --> 01:48:38.120]   Yeah.
[01:48:38.120 --> 01:48:41.720]   But I'm actually kind of excited about the Samsung Galaxy gear.
[01:48:41.720 --> 01:48:44.120]   Well, I'm excited about all the potential wearable technology.
[01:48:44.120 --> 01:48:45.120]   Me too.
[01:48:45.120 --> 01:48:46.120]   But I'm more curious to see-
[01:48:46.120 --> 01:48:47.120]   Because you're an athlete.
[01:48:47.120 --> 01:48:48.120]   You and I are athletes.
[01:48:48.120 --> 01:48:49.120]   Yes.
[01:48:49.120 --> 01:48:50.120]   Why are you laughing?
[01:48:50.120 --> 01:48:51.120]   I'm not laughing.
[01:48:51.120 --> 01:48:52.440]   Runners, we're out there.
[01:48:52.440 --> 01:48:56.360]   We're doing pole vaulting, shot pudding, discus throwing.
[01:48:56.360 --> 01:49:01.120]   And we want to measure heart rate, blood pressure, VO2 max.
[01:49:01.120 --> 01:49:04.760]   I've been wearing my Fitbit for like, what, two and a half years?
[01:49:04.760 --> 01:49:05.760]   Like nonstop.
[01:49:05.760 --> 01:49:06.760]   It's not came out.
[01:49:06.760 --> 01:49:07.760]   Yeah, pretty much since they came out.
[01:49:07.760 --> 01:49:08.760]   And I've never gotten into-
[01:49:08.760 --> 01:49:09.760]   You're such a dragon.
[01:49:09.760 --> 01:49:10.760]   I do.
[01:49:10.760 --> 01:49:11.760]   Yeah, every single day.
[01:49:11.760 --> 01:49:12.760]   Have you upgraded to newer devices?
[01:49:12.760 --> 01:49:13.760]   I'm on the one now.
[01:49:13.760 --> 01:49:14.760]   Yeah.
[01:49:14.760 --> 01:49:15.760]   I tried the Ultra.
[01:49:15.760 --> 01:49:16.760]   I like the flex because I like it on the one.
[01:49:16.760 --> 01:49:17.760]   Well, that's the thing.
[01:49:17.760 --> 01:49:23.100]   I said the thing I'm really curious to see is if Samsung and if Apple for example come
[01:49:23.100 --> 01:49:27.800]   out with some kind of wearable tech like that, is it going to be the kind of thing that
[01:49:27.800 --> 01:49:30.360]   is widely adopted by men and women both?
[01:49:30.360 --> 01:49:31.360]   Right.
[01:49:31.360 --> 01:49:34.720]   Because the problem I had with the Nike fuel band and some of the other band type devices
[01:49:34.720 --> 01:49:39.160]   and I know this is not true of every woman, every woman, but I, for me it just didn't
[01:49:39.160 --> 01:49:41.600]   really go with my look, you know?
[01:49:41.600 --> 01:49:42.600]   It is ugly.
[01:49:42.600 --> 01:49:43.600]   It is ugly.
[01:49:43.600 --> 01:49:44.600]   Especially the fuel band.
[01:49:44.600 --> 01:49:45.600]   That is something I think about.
[01:49:45.600 --> 01:49:47.600]   Something I think about a Michelin tire on your wrist.
[01:49:47.600 --> 01:49:51.000]   Yeah, but then there was an article actually in this month's Vogue as well, the September
[01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:58.080]   issue that talks about how a lot of fashionistas are taking, whoa, Leo, chill out.
[01:49:58.080 --> 01:49:59.800]   I'm never drinking wine again.
[01:49:59.800 --> 01:50:02.120]   Stay away from my laptop.
[01:50:02.120 --> 01:50:06.600]   They're saying that a lot of fashionista types are picking up the fuel band because
[01:50:06.600 --> 01:50:08.520]   they like tracking how much they're walking.
[01:50:08.520 --> 01:50:12.360]   And then they also had a full spread with all Google Glass in the entire issue.
[01:50:12.360 --> 01:50:13.360]   You're kidding.
[01:50:13.360 --> 01:50:14.360]   Yeah, there's a four-page spread.
[01:50:14.360 --> 01:50:18.440]   Well, it could become, it could become, is that yours or mine?
[01:50:18.440 --> 01:50:19.440]   That's mine, the cut.
[01:50:19.440 --> 01:50:20.440]   Okay.
[01:50:20.440 --> 01:50:21.440]   You were smart.
[01:50:21.440 --> 01:50:22.440]   You had yours with a wide big bottom.
[01:50:22.440 --> 01:50:23.440]   I think this is true.
[01:50:23.440 --> 01:50:24.440]   That's how I roll.
[01:50:24.440 --> 01:50:25.440]   The bottom's too narrow.
[01:50:25.440 --> 01:50:28.720]   Maybe there's an opportunity, as everyone sees things that like not necessarily wearable
[01:50:28.720 --> 01:50:30.760]   tech, but there's going to be more watches.
[01:50:30.760 --> 01:50:31.760]   Samsung's got one.
[01:50:31.760 --> 01:50:34.160]   They're coming out with another one that Sony's made on.
[01:50:34.160 --> 01:50:38.240]   There's going to be more watches that are sold to your phone, but I bet you more of
[01:50:38.240 --> 01:50:42.840]   them down the road are also going to have capabilities that might rival the likes of
[01:50:42.840 --> 01:50:45.680]   what the fuel band does and the likes of what the Fitbit does.
[01:50:45.680 --> 01:50:50.000]   Well, that's why I'm hoping that if Samsung and Apple, in my mind, usually do some of
[01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:54.440]   the best designed products out there in the space, in the consumer space.
[01:50:54.440 --> 01:51:00.280]   So I'm hoping that they either have a variety of different style options available or if
[01:51:00.280 --> 01:51:05.320]   somehow they can get that magical single device that looks good on everyone.
[01:51:05.320 --> 01:51:06.320]   Like this.
[01:51:06.320 --> 01:51:07.320]   I mean, the iPod did it.
[01:51:07.320 --> 01:51:12.240]   I mean, it's a different kind of thing, but they, you know, previous MP3 players and
[01:51:12.240 --> 01:51:15.920]   media devices, what am I looking at right now?
[01:51:15.920 --> 01:51:17.600]   I don't think you're going to get that up on screen.
[01:51:17.600 --> 01:51:18.600]   Yeah, I think you're unplugging.
[01:51:18.600 --> 01:51:20.160]   Unplug and plug that back in again.
[01:51:20.160 --> 01:51:21.640]   You're having some trouble out there.
[01:51:21.640 --> 01:51:22.640]   Thank you.
[01:51:22.640 --> 01:51:23.640]   I read from JWINE.
[01:51:23.640 --> 01:51:24.640]   There we go.
[01:51:24.640 --> 01:51:25.640]   Is that better?
[01:51:25.640 --> 01:51:26.640]   You're getting it now?
[01:51:26.640 --> 01:51:27.640]   Yeah.
[01:51:27.640 --> 01:51:29.280]   So this is, I know, why not?
[01:51:29.280 --> 01:51:31.640]   I was just going to, maybe, you know, maybe I did break the computer.
[01:51:31.640 --> 01:51:33.680]   No, it was not working before the cup happened.
[01:51:33.680 --> 01:51:34.680]   Oh, okay.
[01:51:34.680 --> 01:51:35.920]   What are you doing this video for?
[01:51:35.920 --> 01:51:38.680]   Well, it's a, I was just showing the parachute video.
[01:51:38.680 --> 01:51:40.320]   You could probably pull that up, Chad.
[01:51:40.320 --> 01:51:42.320]   Oh, yeah, just do that.
[01:51:42.320 --> 01:51:43.960]   Look at that.
[01:51:43.960 --> 01:51:45.320]   We have cameras.
[01:51:45.320 --> 01:51:49.320]   So this is a, this is a, one of my latest accessories.
[01:51:49.320 --> 01:51:55.000]   The idea here is you attach a parachute to your butt and then you run as fast as you
[01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:56.000]   can.
[01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:57.000]   Oh, it's frozen now.
[01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.800]   It may have actually, yeah.
[01:51:59.800 --> 01:52:01.200]   Oh, is the computer dead now?
[01:52:01.200 --> 01:52:04.480]   Yeah, the computer actually died when I was showing that video.
[01:52:04.480 --> 01:52:06.280]   So that's going to be on the screen forever.
[01:52:06.280 --> 01:52:10.160]   Let's let it air out some more.
[01:52:10.160 --> 01:52:11.160]   It's good.
[01:52:11.160 --> 01:52:12.160]   It's dripping.
[01:52:12.160 --> 01:52:13.160]   Is there a way that I can pull it up on my machine?
[01:52:13.160 --> 01:52:14.160]   No, it's not worth it.
[01:52:14.160 --> 01:52:15.160]   Does it really matter?
[01:52:15.160 --> 01:52:16.880]   I lie, the gear looks really terrible.
[01:52:16.880 --> 01:52:17.880]   The Samsung gear.
[01:52:17.880 --> 01:52:18.880]   Okay.
[01:52:18.880 --> 01:52:20.560]   But we'll find out September 4th, they're going to announce that when they announce the
[01:52:20.560 --> 01:52:22.680]   Note 3.
[01:52:22.680 --> 01:52:24.480]   We think that's the rumor.
[01:52:24.480 --> 01:52:25.720]   I'm waiting for Apple.
[01:52:25.720 --> 01:52:29.480]   I think Apple, if anybody's going to get it right, they hired Jay Blonick, who is, you
[01:52:29.480 --> 01:52:33.920]   know, the guy who did the Nike fuel ban, who's a really top fitness consultant.
[01:52:33.920 --> 01:52:35.920]   Yeah, I'll do it.
[01:52:35.920 --> 01:52:39.960]   If that is the case, either they're going to announce it before he's had the ability to
[01:52:39.960 --> 01:52:43.520]   have an impact on that product or it's going to be a while.
[01:52:43.520 --> 01:52:44.520]   Yes, it's middle.
[01:52:44.520 --> 01:52:45.720]   Is that what it's supposed to look like?
[01:52:45.720 --> 01:52:46.720]   No, you don't know.
[01:52:46.720 --> 01:52:47.720]   Nobody's seen it.
[01:52:47.720 --> 01:52:48.720]   Stop it.
[01:52:48.720 --> 01:52:49.720]   Yeah.
[01:52:49.720 --> 01:52:50.720]   Okay.
[01:52:50.720 --> 01:52:52.120]   Now you'll agree with me as an athlete, Veronica.
[01:52:52.120 --> 01:52:54.120]   Warming up is so important.
[01:52:54.120 --> 01:52:55.120]   It is.
[01:52:55.120 --> 01:52:57.120]   You're going to have muscles loose.
[01:52:57.120 --> 01:53:01.920]   I don't stretch before I work out and I very badly hurt myself.
[01:53:01.920 --> 01:53:02.920]   Right.
[01:53:02.920 --> 01:53:03.920]   Right.
[01:53:03.920 --> 01:53:06.920]   You don't have to show the whole thing.
[01:53:06.920 --> 01:53:09.120]   It's all right.
[01:53:09.120 --> 01:53:10.120]   Jay's been a chair.
[01:53:10.120 --> 01:53:11.320]   I know you work out because I see you checking on path.
[01:53:11.320 --> 01:53:12.320]   I work out a lot.
[01:53:12.320 --> 01:53:13.320]   Yeah.
[01:53:13.320 --> 01:53:17.240]   You wouldn't know it, but I do.
[01:53:17.240 --> 01:53:19.120]   What else is in the rundown?
[01:53:19.120 --> 01:53:20.120]   Anything else?
[01:53:20.120 --> 01:53:21.120]   Oh, right.
[01:53:21.120 --> 01:53:22.120]   I'm in charge of the rest of the time.
[01:53:22.120 --> 01:53:24.480]   You're the, Facebook is trying to always deny that Facebook makes people depressed.
[01:53:24.480 --> 01:53:25.480]   They say the internet.
[01:53:25.480 --> 01:53:26.480]   It does make internet.
[01:53:26.480 --> 01:53:27.480]   Oh, no.
[01:53:27.480 --> 01:53:28.480]   It gets oppressed.
[01:53:28.480 --> 01:53:29.480]   It's totally depressing.
[01:53:29.480 --> 01:53:30.480]   It's depressing.
[01:53:30.480 --> 01:53:31.480]   It's depressing.
[01:53:31.480 --> 01:53:33.640]   Oh, oh, this is the best thing.
[01:53:33.640 --> 01:53:37.880]   Apparently, if you take a lot of selfies of yourself and post them on Facebook, it makes
[01:53:37.880 --> 01:53:38.880]   people hate you.
[01:53:38.880 --> 01:53:39.880]   Oh, well done.
[01:53:39.880 --> 01:53:41.080]   It makes people like you less.
[01:53:41.080 --> 01:53:42.080]   Surprise.
[01:53:42.080 --> 01:53:43.080]   Yeah.
[01:53:43.080 --> 01:53:46.920]   So if you think you're being cute by posting a lot of selfies, you're actually causing like
[01:53:46.920 --> 01:53:47.920]   making people like me at you.
[01:53:47.920 --> 01:53:51.440]   Unless you're I just mean, if you're I just mean post as many selfies as you want.
[01:53:51.440 --> 01:53:52.440]   I love that.
[01:53:52.440 --> 01:53:53.440]   There's some people that do this and have been told.
[01:53:53.440 --> 01:53:54.920]   They're like, okay, maybe I won't do that.
[01:53:54.920 --> 01:53:57.480]   And then like it's ingrained into them or something.
[01:53:57.480 --> 01:53:59.520]   And like within a week, they're doing it again.
[01:53:59.520 --> 01:54:00.520]   Yeah.
[01:54:00.520 --> 01:54:01.520]   I interact with people.
[01:54:01.520 --> 01:54:02.520]   Sometimes people are addicted.
[01:54:02.520 --> 01:54:06.040]   But I think we study on like the internet makes people depressed or Facebook.
[01:54:06.040 --> 01:54:10.160]   I think it just harkens down to the fact that human beings are social creatures and you
[01:54:10.160 --> 01:54:11.400]   need to have something of substance.
[01:54:11.400 --> 01:54:14.800]   So if you're going to be doing stuff online, you have to be doing it with real people that
[01:54:14.800 --> 01:54:17.120]   you give us about.
[01:54:17.120 --> 01:54:21.200]   And if there are people that you just have these basic like coincidences with, I mean,
[01:54:21.200 --> 01:54:22.200]   like your acquaintances.
[01:54:22.200 --> 01:54:23.200]   You happen to go to say hi to you.
[01:54:23.200 --> 01:54:24.200]   High school example.
[01:54:24.200 --> 01:54:27.760]   Make you depressed because you're not getting what a human being needs, which is like real
[01:54:27.760 --> 01:54:29.320]   contact with people.
[01:54:29.320 --> 01:54:30.320]   It can be virtual contact.
[01:54:30.320 --> 01:54:34.480]   But it has to be someone that you legitimately have a real relationship with.
[01:54:34.480 --> 01:54:39.040]   Otherwise you're going to be alone like living on rabbit.
[01:54:39.040 --> 01:54:41.160]   You can you coke you're eating.
[01:54:41.160 --> 01:54:42.160]   You're eating all the time.
[01:54:42.160 --> 01:54:45.680]   But rabbit is so lean you actually will die because there's not enough fat in a rabbit.
[01:54:45.680 --> 01:54:46.680]   This is what I've been told.
[01:54:46.680 --> 01:54:49.120]   If you live if you attempt to live on rabbit, you'll die.
[01:54:49.120 --> 01:54:50.280]   You think you're being nurtured.
[01:54:50.280 --> 01:54:51.280]   You're being sustained.
[01:54:51.280 --> 01:54:52.280]   You're eating delicious roasted.
[01:54:52.280 --> 01:54:53.720]   You're eating people have tested this.
[01:54:53.720 --> 01:54:57.040]   Rabbit meat, but it will kill you because it's so lean.
[01:54:57.040 --> 01:54:58.280]   And Facebook is like that.
[01:54:58.280 --> 01:55:01.960]   It's the appearance of connection without I think you're exactly right without actual
[01:55:01.960 --> 01:55:02.960]   connection.
[01:55:02.960 --> 01:55:06.400]   I don't know if that's I think that's more just the way you interact online.
[01:55:06.400 --> 01:55:07.400]   It's not Facebook's fault.
[01:55:07.400 --> 01:55:10.200]   It's the user's fault to some extent, I guess, because they think that they're getting it
[01:55:10.200 --> 01:55:11.360]   from it when they're not.
[01:55:11.360 --> 01:55:13.960]   But then it's just also the ways that you are interacting with.
[01:55:13.960 --> 01:55:15.600]   I saw it on Mythbusters.
[01:55:15.600 --> 01:55:16.600]   Goddamn it.
[01:55:16.600 --> 01:55:17.600]   I know it's true.
[01:55:17.600 --> 01:55:18.600]   All right.
[01:55:18.600 --> 01:55:19.760]   I'm going to stop.
[01:55:19.760 --> 01:55:25.320]   We're going to be stopped right now because my laptop's dead and it's five after five
[01:55:25.320 --> 01:55:27.040]   o'clock in the 49ers are playing.
[01:55:27.040 --> 01:55:28.800]   So thank you very much Veronica Belmont.
[01:55:28.800 --> 01:55:30.760]   You're a wonderful, wonderful human being.
[01:55:30.760 --> 01:55:31.760]   Oh, thank you.
[01:55:31.760 --> 01:55:34.520]   And get yourself the lubota.
[01:55:34.520 --> 01:55:35.760]   You should just buy those.
[01:55:35.760 --> 01:55:36.760]   You deserve.
[01:55:36.760 --> 01:55:37.760]   I can't do four and a half in shields.
[01:55:37.760 --> 01:55:41.080]   It's too much for my little wobbly flat feet.
[01:55:41.080 --> 01:55:42.400]   I don't know how women do that.
[01:55:42.400 --> 01:55:44.320]   I don't even honest with it.
[01:55:44.320 --> 01:55:46.400]   I don't know how they do it.
[01:55:46.400 --> 01:55:47.720]   She is at texilla.com.
[01:55:47.720 --> 01:55:49.880]   We're on TEKZILLA.com.
[01:55:49.880 --> 01:55:50.880]   We adore her.
[01:55:50.880 --> 01:55:51.880]   Anything else you want to plug?
[01:55:51.880 --> 01:55:52.880]   Sword and laser?
[01:55:52.880 --> 01:55:53.880]   Yeah, we're still doing Sword and Laser podcast.
[01:55:53.880 --> 01:55:57.080]   We're actually coming out with a book anthology this year, which we're really excited about.
[01:55:57.080 --> 01:55:58.680]   Short stories from our audience.
[01:55:58.680 --> 01:56:00.600]   So that should be really fun.
[01:56:00.600 --> 01:56:04.720]   Doing Factor Fictional over on youtube.com/techfeed every Friday.
[01:56:04.720 --> 01:56:05.720]   And then also--
[01:56:05.720 --> 01:56:06.720]   What's that about Factor Fictional?
[01:56:06.720 --> 01:56:10.720]   It's a look at the technology and science behind TV shows, movies, video games, comic
[01:56:10.720 --> 01:56:11.720]   books.
[01:56:11.720 --> 01:56:14.280]   Is that the one you did the contact explosive on?
[01:56:14.280 --> 01:56:15.280]   Yes.
[01:56:15.280 --> 01:56:16.280]   Yeah.
[01:56:16.280 --> 01:56:22.080]   I'm a woman who's a PhD in chemistry and also writes about science and TV shows.
[01:56:22.080 --> 01:56:23.080]   And she said what?
[01:56:23.080 --> 01:56:27.480]   I actually can't remember exactly what she said right now.
[01:56:27.480 --> 01:56:29.080]   So you'll have to watch to find out.
[01:56:29.080 --> 01:56:30.080]   Factor Fictional.
[01:56:30.080 --> 01:56:31.880]   Thank you, Chad.
[01:56:31.880 --> 01:56:32.880]   Yes.
[01:56:32.880 --> 01:56:35.640]   So it was a great episode, but we do a lot of that kind of stuff.
[01:56:35.640 --> 01:56:36.640]   I love that idea.
[01:56:36.640 --> 01:56:37.640]   Yeah.
[01:56:37.640 --> 01:56:39.640]   I also do a show on PopSugar called The Sync Up.
[01:56:39.640 --> 01:56:40.800]   And what's that about?
[01:56:40.800 --> 01:56:43.640]   It's kind of like a Dear Abbey show for tech help and how to--
[01:56:43.640 --> 01:56:44.640]   How do you sign up?
[01:56:44.640 --> 01:56:45.640]   I don't know.
[01:56:45.640 --> 01:56:47.520]   I don't want to do-- and nobody will let me do this.
[01:56:47.520 --> 01:56:48.720]   Everybody says, no, you can't do this.
[01:56:48.720 --> 01:56:54.280]   A show for guys on this network where women explain why guys are just really schmucks.
[01:56:54.280 --> 01:56:56.680]   Like a dating show.
[01:56:56.680 --> 01:57:01.160]   Like a guy calls up and said, so I gave my girlfriend tires.
[01:57:01.160 --> 01:57:02.920]   And I understand why she's not happy.
[01:57:02.920 --> 01:57:04.800]   Why can't I help you with that?
[01:57:04.800 --> 01:57:05.800]   Because I have the perfect man.
[01:57:05.800 --> 01:57:06.800]   Does he give you tires?
[01:57:06.800 --> 01:57:07.800]   He does.
[01:57:07.800 --> 01:57:08.800]   I give her-- yes.
[01:57:08.800 --> 01:57:09.800]   Yes.
[01:57:09.800 --> 01:57:10.800]   What is the best--
[01:57:10.800 --> 01:57:11.800]   Including--
[01:57:11.800 --> 01:57:13.560]   I also got one spare tire for myself.
[01:57:13.560 --> 01:57:15.560]   And she also tires that.
[01:57:15.560 --> 01:57:17.560]   What is the best gift he ever gave you?
[01:57:17.560 --> 01:57:18.560]   The best gift?
[01:57:18.560 --> 01:57:20.560]   That's a really hard question.
[01:57:20.560 --> 01:57:22.560]   That's-- I don't know.
[01:57:22.560 --> 01:57:24.560]   We're gifted his love.
[01:57:24.560 --> 01:57:26.560]   You seem to have an idea about what it is.
[01:57:26.560 --> 01:57:27.560]   No.
[01:57:27.560 --> 01:57:28.560]   Yeah.
[01:57:28.560 --> 01:57:29.560]   Trying to get some inspiration.
[01:57:29.560 --> 01:57:30.560]   My wedding ring.
[01:57:30.560 --> 01:57:31.560]   You should have said that, but that's okay.
[01:57:31.560 --> 01:57:32.560]   We gave you a chance.
[01:57:32.560 --> 01:57:35.560]   He's given me lots of great gifts over the years.
[01:57:35.560 --> 01:57:37.560]   That is-- that he is Ryan Block.
[01:57:37.560 --> 01:57:38.560]   Hello.
[01:57:38.560 --> 01:57:42.560]   Product VP product at AOL, where he's working now on some great stuff, I'm sure.
[01:57:42.560 --> 01:57:43.560]   Yes.
[01:57:43.560 --> 01:57:45.760]   I'm a senior or editor emeritus at Engadget.
[01:57:45.760 --> 01:57:47.560]   You will be blogging from the Apple event.
[01:57:47.560 --> 01:57:48.560]   Maybe.
[01:57:48.560 --> 01:57:49.560]   We'll see.
[01:57:49.560 --> 01:57:50.560]   All good.
[01:57:50.560 --> 01:57:51.560]   Well, September 10th.
[01:57:51.560 --> 01:57:52.560]   It's not come up here.
[01:57:52.560 --> 01:57:53.560]   Can't confirm where to deny.
[01:57:53.560 --> 01:57:55.560]   David Prager is in super slow-mo.
[01:57:55.560 --> 01:57:56.560]   Yeah.
[01:57:56.560 --> 01:57:57.560]   I've also got--
[01:57:57.560 --> 01:57:58.560]   This store.
[01:57:58.560 --> 01:57:59.560]   Since we're in plugging away.
[01:57:59.560 --> 01:58:00.560]   Yeah.
[01:58:00.560 --> 01:58:01.560]   I started another company.
[01:58:01.560 --> 01:58:02.560]   It's called Pitch Starter.
[01:58:02.560 --> 01:58:03.560]   Tell me about this.
[01:58:03.560 --> 01:58:06.560]   We do-- we produce about videos for early stage startups.
[01:58:06.560 --> 01:58:08.560]   So kind of promotional marketing videos.
[01:58:08.560 --> 01:58:09.560]   Like Kickstarter, for instance.
[01:58:09.560 --> 01:58:10.560]   It's all about the video.
[01:58:10.560 --> 01:58:12.560]   If you got a good video, you're going to make money on Kickstarter.
[01:58:12.560 --> 01:58:13.560]   So that was the original idea.
[01:58:13.560 --> 01:58:18.560]   It's like, let's help people make videos for their Kickstarter campaigns.
[01:58:18.560 --> 01:58:22.560]   And it turned into like having done everything with the revision 3 and then, you know, been
[01:58:22.560 --> 01:58:26.560]   into tech and then been into entrepreneurship and startups and having a passion for that
[01:58:26.560 --> 01:58:30.160]   stuff is kind of like I want to use my television background and help people tell the stories
[01:58:30.160 --> 01:58:33.520]   of their company so they can reach their potential users and consumers and customers
[01:58:33.520 --> 01:58:34.760]   and clients and all that.
[01:58:34.760 --> 01:58:35.760]   Pitch Starter?
[01:58:35.760 --> 01:58:36.760]   Yeah.
[01:58:36.760 --> 01:58:37.760]   What's the domain?
[01:58:37.760 --> 01:58:38.760]   Pitchstarter.com.
[01:58:38.760 --> 01:58:40.760]   And there is no website up yet, but it will be up.
[01:58:40.760 --> 01:58:41.760]   Oh.
[01:58:41.760 --> 01:58:43.760]   But I still wanted to mention it because we were going to store it.
[01:58:43.760 --> 01:58:44.760]   It'll be there.
[01:58:44.760 --> 01:58:45.760]   It'll be there.
[01:58:45.760 --> 01:58:46.760]   It'll be there.
[01:58:46.760 --> 01:58:47.760]   It'll be up.
[01:58:47.760 --> 01:58:48.760]   We'll have something as a placeholder in--
[01:58:48.760 --> 01:58:50.760]   You know my favorite--
[01:58:50.760 --> 01:58:53.760]   As a placeholder in the late September and then I'll have the full website up in October.
[01:58:53.760 --> 01:58:56.760]   My favorite video is the Dollar Shave Club video.
[01:58:56.760 --> 01:58:57.760]   Have you seen that?
[01:58:57.760 --> 01:58:58.760]   Yeah, I'm like in--
[01:58:58.760 --> 01:58:59.760]   That is so good.
[01:58:59.760 --> 01:59:01.260]   And they're not an advertiser or anything.
[01:59:01.260 --> 01:59:02.560]   So funny.
[01:59:02.560 --> 01:59:04.060]   I watch that over and over again.
[01:59:04.060 --> 01:59:05.760]   I just-- it's like, OK, go or something like that.
[01:59:05.760 --> 01:59:06.760]   It's just very clever.
[01:59:06.760 --> 01:59:08.760]   They have a new video out too.
[01:59:08.760 --> 01:59:09.760]   Do they?
[01:59:09.760 --> 01:59:11.260]   With a new product, which I tried to get and they wouldn't give it to you.
[01:59:11.260 --> 01:59:12.260]   But once.
[01:59:12.260 --> 01:59:13.260]   I'm like, you know what?
[01:59:13.260 --> 01:59:14.260]   That sounds weird.
[01:59:14.260 --> 01:59:16.860]   I'm just going to buy one and they said you can't-- you have to be a subscribing number.
[01:59:16.860 --> 01:59:19.920]   And I said, well, I can't subscribe because I don't shave, really.
[01:59:19.920 --> 01:59:21.920]   And so they said, well, sorry, we can't tell you a product.
[01:59:21.920 --> 01:59:22.920]   Subscribed to the bum wipes.
[01:59:22.920 --> 01:59:23.920]   No, you can't.
[01:59:23.920 --> 01:59:24.920]   You have to get razor blades and--
[01:59:24.920 --> 01:59:25.920]   Yeah.
[01:59:25.920 --> 01:59:27.760]   Are the blades any good?
[01:59:27.760 --> 01:59:28.760]   No.
[01:59:28.760 --> 01:59:30.760]   Our blades are f*cking great.
[01:59:30.760 --> 01:59:31.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:59:31.760 --> 01:59:38.160]   Again, but what's funny is it gets more and more over the top.
[01:59:38.160 --> 01:59:39.160]   Yeah.
[01:59:39.160 --> 01:59:41.940]   I don't realize it's a real product because you think it's not almost because the first
[01:59:41.940 --> 01:59:42.940]   time you see it.
[01:59:42.940 --> 01:59:43.940]   You know what?
[01:59:43.940 --> 01:59:45.300]   They're not an advertiser.
[01:59:45.300 --> 01:59:47.460]   We talk to them and they don't have enough money to advertise.
[01:59:47.460 --> 01:59:50.980]   But I actually get the blades and everything.
[01:59:50.980 --> 01:59:52.900]   And the butt wipes are fabulous.
[01:59:52.900 --> 01:59:53.900]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:59:53.900 --> 01:59:56.900]   I don't think this could be--
[01:59:56.900 --> 01:59:58.900]   Please make up.
[01:59:58.900 --> 02:00:01.500]   Please make up the show title.
[02:00:01.500 --> 02:00:02.500]   Please make up.
[02:00:02.500 --> 02:00:03.500]   [MUSIC PLAYING]

[02:01:01.780 --> 02:01:05.780]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:01:05.780 --> 02:01:07.320]   They are.

[02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:15.080]   That could be my slogan.
[02:01:15.080 --> 02:01:16.000]   Slash.
[02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:16.500]   Nothing.
[02:01:16.500 --> 02:01:18.080]   Because this is the big show.
[02:01:18.080 --> 02:01:18.800]   Thanks for being here.
[02:01:18.800 --> 02:01:19.760]   We'll see you next week.
[02:01:19.760 --> 02:01:20.720]   Another twit.
[02:01:20.720 --> 02:01:21.720]   He's in the can.
[02:01:21.720 --> 02:01:23.720]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:01:23.720 --> 02:01:24.720]   [APPLAUSE]
[02:01:24.720 --> 02:01:25.720]   [MUSIC PLAYING]

[02:01:28.720 --> 02:01:30.320]   Best show I've ever been.
[02:01:30.320 --> 02:01:32.160]   Oh, I hope your laptop is OK.
[02:01:32.160 --> 02:01:32.720]   Oh, it's fine.
[02:01:32.720 --> 02:01:33.720]   Do it with a twit.
[02:01:33.720 --> 02:01:34.720]   All right.
[02:01:34.720 --> 02:01:35.220]   [BEEP]
[02:01:35.220 --> 02:01:37.920]   So Patrick Norton said that Ryan and I can't sit next to each other on Twitter.
[02:01:37.920 --> 02:01:38.920]   Why?
[02:01:38.920 --> 02:01:41.880]   Because we have better discussions if we're facing each other.
[02:01:41.880 --> 02:01:43.760]   And not side by side.
[02:01:43.760 --> 02:01:48.040]   Because he took some kind of audience or group dynamic course in college.
[02:01:48.040 --> 02:01:49.320]   Like some big producer type.
[02:01:49.320 --> 02:01:49.820]   Yeah.
[02:01:49.820 --> 02:01:50.520]   He's like, yeah, you're good.
[02:01:50.520 --> 02:01:51.920]   No, he shouldn't sit next to each other.
[02:01:51.920 --> 02:01:53.600]   Sit across from each other.
[02:01:53.600 --> 02:01:55.760]   I don't really care, but I figure you want to--
[02:01:55.760 --> 02:01:56.260]   I thank you.
[02:01:56.260 --> 02:01:58.040]   I saw that it was set up for me when I came back.
[02:01:58.040 --> 02:01:59.080]   Yeah, he said it.
[02:01:59.080 --> 02:02:02.320]   He said, Don, I want to sit next to her.
[02:02:02.320 --> 02:02:04.720]   Said I wanted to get to know my good friend David a little bit.
[02:02:04.720 --> 02:02:08.300]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:02:08.300 --> 02:02:10.060]   Ryan's got my source of all things to go on.
[02:02:10.060 --> 02:02:12.580]   You know what's going to start all sorts of Twitter rumors?
[02:02:12.580 --> 02:02:13.340]   About what?
[02:02:13.340 --> 02:02:15.620]   That you're not sitting next to your husband.
[02:02:15.620 --> 02:02:16.580]   You know how this--
[02:02:16.580 --> 02:02:18.180]   You know how Twitter is.
[02:02:18.180 --> 02:02:18.940]   Twitter's full of--
[02:02:18.940 --> 02:02:19.940]   Oh!
[02:02:19.940 --> 02:02:21.140]   Snap.
[02:02:21.140 --> 02:02:23.860]   Twitter is full of a bunch of bitches.
[02:02:23.860 --> 02:02:25.340]   Oh, my God.
[02:02:25.340 --> 02:02:26.180]   It is though.
[02:02:26.180 --> 02:02:27.100]   Do you want some wine?
[02:02:27.100 --> 02:02:28.540]   I think you noticed that.
[02:02:28.540 --> 02:02:29.260]   That shows me--
[02:02:29.260 --> 02:02:30.180]   I feel like you feel like you're not the one.
[02:02:30.180 --> 02:02:31.180]   --you've already got the title.
[02:02:31.180 --> 02:02:32.460]   You noticed that, though.
[02:02:32.460 --> 02:02:34.920]   I mean, like you say one thing and they go, hmm.
[02:02:34.920 --> 02:02:39.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:40.920]   Episode 420, Twitter is full of a lot of bitches.
[02:02:40.920 --> 02:02:42.320]   Oh, these are the f-bitches.
[02:02:42.320 --> 02:02:42.820]   Twitter.
[02:02:42.820 --> 02:02:45.240]   It's the bitches all the way down.
