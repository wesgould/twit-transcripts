[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   This is Twit, this week in Tech, Episode 10 for June 20th, 2005.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   [Music]
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. It's time for a Twitcast.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   Wait, but I'm going to take a picture of Patrick.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   Because it's rare that I get to do this, actually it's not that rare, I did it which is two Twitcasts ago,
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   but it's fun to have you actually in person.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   In studio.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   In studio. I almost said that David. I almost said that.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   I'm going to take a picture.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   You're going to sidekick now?
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   Yeah, you didn't know I had a sidekick?
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   You go through a phone like Kevin Rose goes through a phone.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   Ah, yes I do.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   And I'm going to get a picture of Patrick in the Twit.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   All right, he's doing the Twit, baby.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Episode 10, "Hard on the Heels of Episode 9."
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   [Laughs]
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   Well, it may actually hit the server before Episode 9.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   Ah, yeah, that's a good point. I don't know what's going on with our website. I apologize.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   I actually think I do know what's going on. I think it fell apart.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   It's saying it's full.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   Yes, definitely not.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   What started with the FTP server?
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   Yeah, it was doing that last week. That's what that FTP problem was.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   I shouldn't have paid attention.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   So if the Twit.tv suddenly just appears, it's going to be because we need to rebuild the servers.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   Right.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   And I don't know what I'm going to do anyway. I'm hoping that I can get this all fixed before I go to St. Petersburg.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   What we are going to do is we have heard what you said.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   You want us to be on time rather than standing like miraculous digital quality radio.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   The reason this sounds crappy is because it's on time. It's raw.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   What is that poster they put in the store to say? You can have it.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   You have it good, cheap, or fast. Pick any two.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   So this is good and fast.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   No, it's cheap and fast.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   When everybody else is up here, we'll label it a Yoshi on an ISD.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   I think it can actually. Everybody else can sit around in a room.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   Let me introduce the table mates.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   Our Twitcast for episode nine. Patrick Norton, of course you've already heard.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   He has appeared our Twit office. How do you like him? Pretty nice.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   It's gorgeous.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   Pogassing live from Petaluma, California.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   And of course you can see Butter and Eggs from the distance.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   Southern California, Mr. Robert Herron. Hello, Robert. How are you today?
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   I'm very good. Thank you.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   I'm glad we could pry you away from Battlefield number two.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   I've got Robertson, Northern California.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   The demo.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   Oh, I'm sorry. Robert is in Northern California. You're in San Francisco.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   I am. I'm in Southern California. David Prager.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Time for the after the time being. Not too much longer.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   I think I might be back in San Francisco.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   Former G4 employee. You're going to move up here with Kevin and Keith and everybody.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   I don't think I'm going to live with them, but I'll probably move up kind of in accordance with them.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   Good. That's great. So the last guy in LA will be Mr. Yoshi.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   Hey Yoshi.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   Yes, I am the last one still down here.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   Last man's standing.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   And he's not leaving because he's got a job, baby.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Yeah, I'm actually going to be leaving where I'm at. I'm going to be moving up towards Burbank up that direction.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   Oh, moving up north.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   It's a little better than where I'm at now. That's for sure.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   How is the job? You enjoy it.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   Oh, I'm loving it. It's great. Special Effects Company.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   Yeah, gentle giant digital. We do 3D scans.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   That's really cool. So you've been on the job a week now.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   Mm-hmm.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   Did you get the training and now are you deep into the work?
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   Are you still learning how to use all equipment?
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   I'm still getting more training. I've already gone out on location.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   I can't say what we did, but it was for Spider-Man 3.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   See, this is cool.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   Now we've got an inside track into the Hollywood.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   Yeah, but I'll get fired if he tells us anything useful and we talk about podcast.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   Missing in action this week, Kevin Rose. Don't know what happened.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   Kevin Rose has a busy is what happened.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   OK, we don't say anything.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   Kevin has a previous engagement.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   A little too busy for us apparently.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   Well, you know.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   That's OK. No, we're at our limit anyway, so that's fine.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   So, I guess we should get down to brass tax, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   which is the stories of the day.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   Yoshi, you had some interesting stuff you wanted to talk about.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   Yeah, I tend to hold punch. I don't know which ones you like.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   Let's talk about this new PSP firmware.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   Well, basically after the 1.0 firmware, Sony fixed it.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   So a lot of the cool mods that we'd seen, we couldn't do like the emulators,
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   like the memory stick mod, and now they've found the way around that in version 1.5.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   But some of the new games coming out will update your firmware.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   So now I was looking at the make.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   Was it?
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   Yeah, I think it was make. Phil Tyrone was talking about what it took to hack it.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   You took two memory sticks.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   You put a loader on one. You put the game on the...
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   It's the most complicated workaround I've ever seen.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   Have you tried it? I haven't done it yet.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   There's actually... I was just reading this morning.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   There's a Japanese guy that figured out how to do it without having to swap the memory sticks.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   Oh, how will you? That was kind of nutty.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   That was just way too much work.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   And then at the end of it, he says, "And now look, you can play chess."
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   It's like, "Good. I just hacked my PSP at a great cost and time to play chess."
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   What you can do is you can put a main emulator on there.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   That I like.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   Main games I have.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   You have, but I've got a lot.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   That I like. That would be really cool.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   How big is the main emulator? Will it fit on one memory stick?
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   Oh, yeah. You put it like a one-gig memory stick in there.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   You could put a couple thousand main games on that.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   Wouldn't that be cool? Play Galaxian on your PSP.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   Should we put out that for anybody who hasn't seen a newspaper in the last few months,
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   that the PSP is the PlayStation Portable.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   It's a small handheld. It's extremely popular and hacking it.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   It's been the objective of several thousand people who haven't left their house since it shipped.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   It's funny because it was the big story.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   And then Xbox 360 and PS3 hit the newsstands.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   And people just kind of forgotten about the PSP except for the hackers.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   I haven't bought a new game for it since I bought it originally.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   Has anybody actually bought one of those little movies through Cell-A?
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   It comes with Spider-Man 2.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   The UMD.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   Yeah, the UMD.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   They just said that they're not going to try and fight the fact that there's going to be a lot of porn coming out on UMDs.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   Did you hear that?
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   Well, there's a lot of things coming out in Japan.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   Why would you... I'm sorry, I'm missing the point.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   Why would you want a handheld device with porn?
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   You don't remember being 14, do you?
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   Oh, that's right.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   I must be missing something.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   Somebody did a PSP mod on you in the laptop into the bathroom, right?
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   Oh, I get it now.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   Somebody on your website did what?
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   Put an eye trip on a PSP?
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   They put an eye trip inside their PSP and it's controllable through the interface to select the frequency.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   It's really slick.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   So you can just take that into your car and listen to your music.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   Oh, I get it.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   You might have to hold it really close to the antenna on the car.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   It's so slick.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   I'll put a link in the shut-ups to this mod.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   It looks really cool.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   And you can't tell it's in there.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   Once he closes it up.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   He's got a little piece on the outside where the crystal has stuck through the case just a little bit.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   And you can see the backside of the crystal.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   That's it.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   No, that's not bad.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   No, I'm not a lot.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   That's a pretty gutsy move to hack your $250 portable that soon.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   I thought so too.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   Good mod.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   Very cool.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   The pictures remind me of some pictures I saw in the net this week of a hoax website where a guy was claiming that Dell laptops had a keystroke longer in it.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   Did you see that?
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   No.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   Yes, I had to go about that.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   That's funny.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   Yeah, the guy told me, you know, I had to open up my brand new Dell laptop to fix the PC card riser and look what was attached to the keyboard man.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   And there's a picture of a chip and he said, I did some research on this chip and this is a keystroke longer and hardware keystroke with a megabyte of storage.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   And I think a lot of people bought it because I got a ton of email from people saying, "Have you heard Dell's logging our keystrokes?"
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   And of course it's not true.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   In fact, Engadget had found where the pictures came from originally.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   Oh, funny.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   Even the pictures were stolen.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   And Engadget pointed out, I think quite rightly so, that you don't see a lot of twist ties inside laptops these days.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   No.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   So don't worry, Dell isn't spying on you and if they are, they're not using the keystroke longer.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   They're using that software they put on your system anyway.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   Oh man.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   I used to have a professor at high school, a teacher at high school.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   And every so often she'd look at us, she was really funny.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   She's just crazed English teachers.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   Be like, you know, let's start a rumor today.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   What do you want to do?
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   It's going to snow this afternoon.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   There's been a problem with the water supply and everybody's going home.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   Who's got a rumor?
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   Somebody would come up with a rumor and then all 30 of us would immediately buy into this until everyone re-ran into.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   Dude, did you hear?
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   And she's like, so you're going to see how long it takes to get back to you after it goes all the way around the school.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   That's a very valuable thing.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   I wish they'd teach that more often.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   So we should start a rumor right now.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   Oh, okay.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   Who's got a rumor?
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   Prager, you're good at this kind of thing.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   Think of something that we can just spread, a rumor that we can spread.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   Oh, I know.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   Microsoft's buying the assets of Tech TV.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   They've got the name, the screen saver.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   Actually, this one was already done.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   Oh, shoot, that's right.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   All right, we'll get back to this later.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   That was a bad rumor.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   People still ask me about that.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   So Microsoft bought Tech TV, huh?
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   How do you feel about that?
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   What?
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   Has anybody been contacted by Microsoft?
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   Nope.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   Nope.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   Okay.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   I think they would call us first, don't you?
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   Well, I don't know.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   Maybe not.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   I don't know.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   Oh, man.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   Has anybody catch up in the credit card?
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   The credit card breach 40 million MasterCard accounts.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   Oh, dear.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   So whatever happened to MasterCard?
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   Oh, they're still out there.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   Are there?
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   Does anybody have a Master?
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   Everybody has a Visa, right?
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   Nobody has a MasterCard?
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   Who knows?
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   It's like a Diners Club.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   Yeah, it's pretty amazing.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   I could see Heron carrying a Diners Club.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   I do have my Chase Manhattan card.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   Have you ever seen the Diners Club card?
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   No, I have.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   Very rare.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   You know what I have seen?
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   It is even rarer.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   Have you ever seen the Black American Express card?
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   Platinum on the bottom.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   Yes.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   There's a black card.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   There are very few of them.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   And there's no limit on it.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   Basically, I think, in my understanding, is there's, if you have a black card, you can ask, you have your own representative and you can pretty much call them like a concept.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   You can say, "This is what I want."
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   I would like to buy Trinidad and Tobago.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   Oh, it's more than no limit.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   I mean, there's all sort of, they call it, I think they call it, is it the Centurion?
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   Hey, this isn't a rumor you're starting, is it?
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   Shh.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   You've heard of Black helicopters?
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   How about the Black American Express card?
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   Very hard to get.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   Only the best, biggest names can get it.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   I have a friend who has one.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   And it's, you know, it's cool as you flash it.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   The problem is, a lot of people don't take it.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   Hey, I'm up on snopes.com.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   Yes, I just saw American Express issues, a special black card that allows its holders to buy anything.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   Status.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   True.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   True.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   You can buy anything.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   There's no limit.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   You could buy a jet.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   You could buy a corporate jet on the thing.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   Oh, no.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   And they just, you know, if you have a black card, you're good for it.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   It's called the Centurion.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   Yep.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   Yep.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   So, and I know it's true because I've been at a meal paid for by the black card.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   I mean, but you kind of wonder if you flash one of those.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   I mean, I mean, how many waiters have seen a black American Express card?
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   Well, you know, Patrick, you're no fan of PayPal.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   Oh.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   And we ever worked that out, by the way.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   We'll discuss that later.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   Okay.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   I'm trying to send money.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   You see that email?
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   So, who here has a PayPal account?
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   Oh, I do.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   I do.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   If you use eBay, you have to have a PayPal account.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   Well, I haven't had a PayPal account in years, and I've created a new PayPal account.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   And it's amazing, like all the-- you just have to do like two out of three things to establish your identity.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   Like, if you wanted to withdraw, or like $500 a month.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   Now you have to do all three things.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   So, you've got to-- you know, basically it's been funny.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   I've opened up a new bank account.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   So, I don't want my PayPal account attached to a real account, to my main account because a bunch of people I used to be in a ski house with got hacked.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   I think it's better now.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   I think it's a lot better now.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   But it's been amazing to like go through.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   It's like, okay, so I had an account.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   It would just occasionally, you know, use a credit card with that, my black American Express card.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   You should have one.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   To pay for my $45, you know, Buffy the--
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   You don't want to use it at a Burger King.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   This is real, dude.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   Isn't-- didn't you hear that Google's going to come out with their own payment-- online payment service?
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   That's what I was getting at, yeah.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   Wow.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   Wouldn't that be-- I mean, you know, this is how we accept donations right now through PayPal.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   But nice thing is you don't have to have a PayPal account to make a donation.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   You can use a credit card.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   But people still are a little skittish about PayPal, I understand.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   After all the bad stuff that did happen, I think they're better now.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   In fact, I never verified my account.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   You know, to verify it, you give them your bank account number, then they make two tiny deposits, like a four cent and an eight cent deposit.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   Then you have to tell them how big the deposits were.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   And that verifies it.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   It's actually--
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   It's not just stuff you can't do without verifying the account.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   Right.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   They get-- I mean, the-- they get on the account.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   Yeah, they get on, yeah.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   And they say, "Why haven't you verified?"
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   So finally, I verified because we were doing this and we were taking quite a bit of money in on the donations.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   Not enough, by the way, for you not to donate.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   So then we think we may have killed two servers.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   We're kind of desperate at this point for money.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   So-- but people have said, you know, "Why don't you use PayPal?"
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   And we haven't yet got it set up so that you can send us checks because I want to get the LLC done.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   We'll do that this week, Patrick.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   Patrick's really wanted me to do this because, you know, Patrick's got a business mind.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   Many people don't know this about Patrick.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   No, Patrick's terrified of being sued and all that.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   Look at an LLC.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   Don't say anything, guys.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   Everything's wonderful.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   I was raised by business people in the wolves.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   I had my parents again and I've heard it.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   So-- and then people I understand don't want to use PayPal.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   I think that that's kept some people from donating.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   This Google thing almost certainly signed up for it right away.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   Everybody trusts Google.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   How could you not?
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   They have all of our information already.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   Why don't we trust them so much?
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   What is it about Google?
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   Well, it's the same way like entire generation.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   I mean, who here doesn't love McDonald's?
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   Deep down in your greasy little heart.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   Who doesn't love McDonald's?
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   I mean, we may avoid it now that we're--
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   Yoshi.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   --oneies and thirties.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   You love McDonald's, don't you, Yoshi?
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   Actually, the only thing I really like from when you more is their fries.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   Yeah.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   But I really like their fries, though.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   I can't say--
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   Even Julia Child said McDonald's fries are the best fries ever.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   Yeah.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   And wasn't your first job in McDonald's, Leo?
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   Yes.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   I was-- oh, yeah.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   In high school.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   In Santa Cruz.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   Wendy's fries are pretty good.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   No, Wendy's fries don't even come close.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   Why can't you say that?
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   They're soggy.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   They're delicious.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   In an outburger fries.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   Any food that's cooked right?
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   If you have food being cooked by teenagers, you don't care.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   It's not going to taste good.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   No.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   It's why you have to go to In and out burger words.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   Food cooked by teenagers that love their job.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   Oh.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   But the key with McDonald's is they have it so mechanistic.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   They have it so mechanized that you can't screw up.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   You know, it's all fun.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   Well, you can, but you have to be really gifted.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   You have to be good at it.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   The other thing is the key is lard, baby.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   But they stop using lard because, you know, for vegetarians.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   Health concerns.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   Health concerns.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   So now they-- if you read Fast Food Nation, if Kevin were here, you would tell us about
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   this.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   Kevin would be horrified if the entire food conversation--
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   We can only have junk food conversations while Kevin's not here.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   They go to a place in New Jersey where they get beef flavoring.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   There's no beef in it.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   It's a chemical that tastes like beef, and they put that in there to give you some of that
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   lard flavor.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   That's hallow action.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   That's hallow action, baby.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   Which actually--
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   Vegans take that.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   So who here is actually running automated windows updates on their system right now?
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   I did.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   And I got him at Tuesday.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   It's amazing.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   Every system I touch.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   Don't you think you have to?
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   I think it's--
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   Of course.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   I like to at least see what their updating--
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   I don't even think that.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   On this rebuilt machine, I forgot that I had it on.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   And you don't even-- it's on Service Pack 2.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   You don't even get that bullet-- the balloon anymore.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   It's just when you click shutdown, it says if you restart, we'll install the updates.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   Everybody trusts Service Pack 2 at this point.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   Even I have actually installed Service Pack 2 on most of my systems.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   I had my first blue screen on Sunday last week with a Service Pack 2.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   But you were installing and things are going horribly wrong.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   Well, it's been-- this has been the week from hell.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   I mean, you know, everything's going to run now.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   Now our servers dead.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   So I--
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   Power supplies, I'm telling you.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   But the back and touch--
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   I spilled the system for two weeks and it turned out to be just a bad power supply.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   That's the worst feeling.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   You didn't stick a piece of steel in the power supply.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   It quite a down-digit.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   No, I did not.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   So there was like a pop and some smoke.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   But I applied Service Pack 2 on the system I finished building.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   It was smooth.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   It works great.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   It actually helped out with the Wi-Fi on the notebook I have when I installed Service Pack 2.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   Just the code so much cleaner in the interface is so much easier to use.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   Of course, I've run between 32 different Wi-Fi access points all the time.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   I have to say, this new system that I built is with Service Pack 2 and all the updates is actually--
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   I think Service Pack 2, if you can get installed, is a big improvement.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   I mean, it just prevents a lot of problems.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   It's really a must-have.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   And remember, you can download it as a standalone update as well.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   It's a couple hundred megs or something.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   Yeah, that's what I do.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   I have a CD with Service Pack with the release service pack.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   Now, here's the question, Robert.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   I downloaded that when it first was released.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   I wonder if it's been changed.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   Do you think they've slipped streamed any changes in there?
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   Oh, of course.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   Yeah, I just, like I said, I finished building.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   That's as the service pack 2 is on.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   You go back to the internet and there's, if you do, say, .NET.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   Well, I understand that--
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   Well, I understand that--
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   It's a separate service pack update.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   But I wonder, do you think they've snuck modifications into Service Pack--
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   into the actual Service Pack 2 download?
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   In other words, should I update my CD of Service Pack 2?
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   Oh, oh, oh, the download itself.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   No, I think that's their static.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   You don't think they've slipped streamed anything?
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   They've slipped streamed stuff in the past.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   I hope they do.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   They'd be nice if they did, but I'm not.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   That's such a big download.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   I really only worry about it when I'm rebuilding.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   I'll just download it fresh.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   Yeah, all right.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   Well, isn't Service Pack 2 really just a massive batch file of all the original updates from XP when it came out kind of?
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   No, no.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   It changes the security-- for instance, it changes the my computer zone, so it's a completely secure zone, which it never was before.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   I mean, it changes behavior as well as patching holes.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   I mean, it's a big, big shift.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   In fact, I've been talking to Steve Gibson, and there's stuff in there that he didn't--
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   he-- nobody ever announced in Service Pack 2 that he's starting to see.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   You know, Ross Sockitz is gone, you know.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   Really?
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   Yeah.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   They turned it off.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   Yeah.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   They didn't announce that.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   Should you explain what Ross Sockitz is and why it was terrifying, everybody?
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   Well, this was something Steve Gibson was re-- and, you know, I wish they really ought to send Steve an apology, because Steve Gibson, when he found out about it, was rattling every cage, and Microsoft was poo-pooing it right and left.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   So here's the deal.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   And by the way, Ross Sockitz are part of Linux, and almost all Unix operating systems, if you run as administrator.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   And what it is, it's the ability to generate IP packets with spoofed originating addresses.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   And why is that used, you know, bad?
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   Well, because a hacker, normally when a hacker does a DOS attack, they all come from the same IP address.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   If you can randomize the IP address for each packet, there's no way for a router to block it.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   You can't just say, "Well, I don't want to see more packets from that guy, because who is-- it's coming from all over."
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   Now, this is something that Unix has had for a long time.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   The point that Steve was making is, yeah, it's fine if you're an administrator and you're running Unix and you presumably know what you're doing,
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   but to build this into a consumer operating system, and to make it part of the operating system and the capability there,
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   is asking for trouble, because hackers will co-opt home systems that have raw socket capabilities,
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   and suddenly they can do distributed, non-service attacks that cannot be stopped, because all the IP addresses are spoofed to random.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   And he was just-- I mean, he met with Microsoft and Microsoft poo-pooted.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   They denied it. There's no problem.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   This was more than a year ago. It was really when XP came out.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   So what was that, three years ago?
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   Just now, they finally turn it off.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   And why? Because there have been massive distributed-- nobody's talking about it, but there have been massive distributed denial of services attacks using raw sockets
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   that have been really problematic.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   And finally, Microsoft's saying, "Oh, yeah, maybe we shouldn't have put that in."
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   They put it in because it's a checkbox.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   It's a once again, it's that feature checkbox.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   Unix has it, we have to have it.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   Anyway, so that's something that nobody announced, but it is turned off in Service Pack 2, and that's a big change.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   But I have the hell of a time getting normal users to do it.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   Most of the people might-- people will call the radio show and say, "No, no, I'll never install Service Pack 2."
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   I'm Service Pack 1. I haven't done an update in a couple of years, because every time I do an update, it breaks windows.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   I have somebody call me and say, "I want you to tell me about my security."
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   Now, here's the whole thing. I've got McAfee antivirus, and I've got Zonal Army.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   He's telling me all the security stuff.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   But I said, "What version of Windows? Service Pack 1? I haven't applied an update since Service Pack 1, because I don't trust him."
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   Which I understand the not trusting, but you know what?
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   It pains me to say this, but it's very scary at this point to not run the updates, because if there's no actual exploits in the wild of whatever the update is path to the world,
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   the update is patching, there will be as soon as it hits the street.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   Well, and the guy could have every security program in the world, but if he's got big holes like that, forget it.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   The first thing these Trojans do is they turn off your antivirus and your firewall.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   They just--
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   Let alone the holes in Internet Explorer, which is likely going to be the source of where the problems would come from.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   Absolutely.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   You'll surf to a site and there'll be a RPC-D-come exploit, and they're on your system, and you're dead.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   So, it's a--
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   It's a--
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   It's a fool's paradise.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   But how do you convince them when you know people--
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   Blue screens like crazy.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   Mm-mm-mm.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   I don't know what the answer is.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   I really don't.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   Well, hopefully most people have their automatic updates turned on.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   Turning them on, folks.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   And if you--
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   No reason not to.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   And if it crashes your system, it's not our fault.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   We didn't mean to do it.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   Actually, this system rollback tool works pretty well.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   Yeah, if you can boot.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   It's not unusual to install service back to and be dead.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   Well, there you have it.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   Back up--
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   It might be that time to format the whole PC and do it clean.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   Yeah.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   I think it works pretty well in that case.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   Although, like I said, I had my first Blue screen of death and I cleaned install last week.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   But I think, you know, that was just a chance.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   And I went back and I did it again and it worked fine, so.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   Ship set drivers, video drivers, everything's important.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   Yeah, and that's the problem with a window system is you don't know what you got.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   Any other big stories before we go to our questions?
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   We're going to do questions this week.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   Cool.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   Any other stories you guys want to talk about?
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   I got the greatest non-tech story that blows me away.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   What is it?
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   A 14-year-old boy broken to a tiny airport and stole a Cessna airplane he'd never flown before.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   He flew it for 30 minutes and landed it successfully and got arrested.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   Wow.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   Had he been using Microsoft Flight Simulator?
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   No, I'm popularly.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   See, there's a tech angle.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   Wow.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   Yeah.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   I mean, I found it on dig, so that's about as close as the tech.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   I can get into it.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   There's a tech angle right there.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   Dig.com, a fine source of stories.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   And we should give credit to Kevin Rose, who did a great job with it.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   Hey, by the way, watch the news next week.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   I think we'll be part of a fairly large announcement.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   We're finally getting our ducks in a row now that my server is completely collapsed.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   Now that we've brought it to its knees.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   And I think really it's just the traffic, the amount of traffic that's been suffering.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   It's just, it just, it hurts.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   Which we'd like to thank you all.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   It's wonderful.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   But we just did, no, I'm not complaining by any means.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   We just did, no one, we had no idea.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   No idea.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   I mean, even on our media, which is one of the places I've been putting the file, 14,000 downloads,
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   an episode just on that one.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   And that's one of dozens of mirrors and of course our own site.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   I would say we're probably up to 200,000 downloads a week now.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   And everywhere I go, people say, love to it.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   Have you experienced that?
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   You know, I haven't traveled to any truck stops in the middle of nowhere.
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   So as soon as I do, I'll probably get that.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   Everywhere I go, it's kind of amazing the response.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   So it looks like we're going to have distribution from at least one, maybe two sources.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   Well, well, announce, I think we're going to get actual distribution next week from one big guy.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   And then I think we're going to have a big announcement.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   They've asked me if I'd participate in the rollout announcement of a big service.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   So we'll have a couple of big, and I'll watch for next week's announcements.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   Which, with any luck, will solve a lot of the bandwidth issues.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   All right, let's get to our questions.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   My friends, my tweets, are you ready?
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   Listen up.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   Hi guys, this is Kat.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   I'm calling from Detroit, Michigan, the Detroit, Michigan area.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   And my question is, I'm interested in getting started in the voiceover business,
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   but I'm not able to install ISDN in my home right now.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   I understand that there's a new software product, I believe, which combined with some hardware
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   products will allow you to have some high quality audio recording as you connect to a studio.
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   Have you heard anything about that?
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   Do you know what I'm talking about?
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   Am I making any sense at all?
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   Yes, thanks.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   You are.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   Thank you, Kat.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   They record albums this way all the time now.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   Really?
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   With T1s.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   You have to have a fairly hefty connection.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   Well, that's more than a few hundred of them.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   A few thousand?
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   So, what would be the difference between say a T1 line and Y ISDN though for audio?
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   Well, we use ISDN for the radio show, and it's very simple.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   It's point to point.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   There's no latency.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   It's not a bandwidth issue for the radio show to give me full fidelity voice on a radio station.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   I only need 64 kilobits using AAC.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   So, we have boxes on either end that are very fast DSPs that do the AAC in real time.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   So, they encode it, and 64 kilobits AAC is CD quality for a mono voice.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   Perfectly adequate.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   Yeah, it's perfectly adequate.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   Yeah, I could send music down the line.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   If I wanted to stereo, I could use both channels to the ISDN, but we only need one channel.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   But the point is, I get a consistent 64 kilobits.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   There's no lag, there's no latency.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   Packets come in order because it's a point to point connection.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   And that's why they use ISDN.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   My DSL is ten times the bandwidth, but it's not guaranteed.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   Right.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   So, that's why when they do these albums, they do albums this way all the time now, coast to coast.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   They use leased lines, they use T1 lines.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   So, if they have guaranteed quality of service, it's not the public internet.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   And I don't think there's any way over the public internet that you could do live.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   That would be guaranteed to sound good.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   Right.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   So, that would be, she needs to move to somewhere she can get ISDN.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   Well, I'm surprised she can't.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   If you can get a phone line, you can almost always get ISDN.
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   Yeah, it's really unusual that I'd be able to get ISDN.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   Yeah, I would just, what's hard is it's hard to get it.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   Because a phone company doesn't want to, they want to get rid of their ISDN switches.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   They don't like it.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   It's the whole box they have to have in there, and they don't want to have an ISDN.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   Well, it's the whole box they have to end there.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   It's also, it's, it's, it's, it's been what they have to guarantee.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   And if they leave their phone, it basically takes over for some regular analog.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   Well, it comes over, it comes over the copper pair.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   I think it probably, I don't know if it needs more.
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   Well, there's a ratio they can use.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   There's a certain amount of bandwidth they can, they can guarantee a certain number of analog lines per lot.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   Right.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   And then they're, they're a significant lower number of ISDN lines.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   So, they have to be careful if they, yeah, yeah, that makes sense.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   Because if everybody with an ISDN modem got on at the same time, it might be a problem.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   Yeah.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   Well, we're, we're two blocks with the central office here.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   In fact, I get great DSL for the same reason.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   Thanks.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   Thank you for the call, Kat.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   Let's get another question.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   Hey, Leah, this is Marcus from Marblehead, Massachusetts.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   The blurb that you have upon your website, the first podcast of the week is the last word in tech.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   It's foot week upon the same line.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   And then when the comma, that'll read a lot better.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   And what, what's the light nights on the site?
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   It'll be your first podcast of the week on one line.
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   And then the next line is the last word in tech.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   That's really a lot better on what's been on the site.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   Part two later, bye.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   Thank you.
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   Actually, we should kill the IS too.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   Your first podcast of the week, the last word in tech.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   And you should, you should capitalize the line in your, I think.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   Guys, I'm just trying to get the thing up.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   More hamsters, Captain.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   We're lucky.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   We're lucky you can log in.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   We're here about punctuation.
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   I don't know.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   Hi, guys.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   This is Sheila in Tri-City, Washington.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   And thanks to my co-worker, Jose Miguel.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   I get to listen to you guys, V-S-C-D's after he's done with them to you.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   And at one time you were inquiring, what should you call your listeners?
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   I suggest you call them the Twitters.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   Hey, keep going and good luck with everything you do.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   Thanks a lot.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   Bye.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   Thank you.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   Thank you, Twitters.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   Patrick likes Twitt, Twitt Heads.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   Twitt Army.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   Twitt Army.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   I like that.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   That way we've got some oomph.
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   Yeah, the Twitt Army.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   Twitt Heads is good.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   This sounds cool.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   Free upgrades with the Twitt Army will camp in Redmond.
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   I am logging into the site now to change the punctuation.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   On our, on our, on our, on our, on our, on our server goes down folks.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   You'll know why.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   Hi, my name is Philip Cole and I'm listening in from Penang, Malaysia.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   Wow.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   My question is, what do you guys do with your broadband connections?
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   I find it hard not to shell out more money for quality content nowadays.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   Any recommendations to really good free stuff that I could download?
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   Thanks.
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   There's this thing called Napster.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   No.
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   Free stuff.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   Oh boy.
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   Let's go, let's go round, round the horn here.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   David Prager, you're a scammer.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   Oh, you know what?
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.800]   Honestly, I, I down load a lot of video content on BitTorrent.
[00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:57.800]   Other than that, I mean, I just, I surf the web and I like to do it.
[00:30:57.800 --> 00:30:59.800]   I kind of like doing it really fast, but.
[00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:00.800]   It's nice just to be able to surf.
[00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:01.800]   Yeah.
[00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:02.800]   Extremely quickly.
[00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:05.800]   I'll tell you one thing, this Skype that we're doing is a good example.
[00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:09.600]   Now we're, this is the first time we've used this on my new DSL connection, which is much
[00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:11.800]   better upstream and you know it's working better, isn't it?
[00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:14.800]   Well, they say Skype says you want to host a Skype conference like this.
[00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:18.400]   You want it on the fastest line and you want it on the fastest system, right?
[00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:25.800]   I get on the fastest line you have dual G5s on a 768 up 5 megabit down DSL.
[00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:28.800]   I'd say that's the fastest line any of us has access to.
[00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:29.800]   It's a pretty good setup.
[00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:30.800]   Yeah.
[00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:31.800]   I think it's, you know what?
[00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:32.800]   Sounds good.
[00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:33.800]   Yeah.
[00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:34.800]   I'm not going to have to edit this one, guys.
[00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:38.800]   Unless somebody says strip club, you know, you see the steer of the picture.
[00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:40.800]   Look at the other side.
[00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:41.800]   I want to edit it.
[00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:42.800]   I want to edit it.
[00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:45.800]   See, I can't even get into the admin page to fix the punctuation.
[00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:47.800]   The bar, I can't open the page.
[00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:48.800]   Can't open the page.
[00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:53.200]   Hi guys, this is Mark Swain from Valencia, California and it's great that you guys are
[00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:57.400]   broadcasting again because I went through a lot of withdrawals a few years ago and I'm
[00:31:57.400 --> 00:32:00.080]   sure a lot of other people did too when tech TV went off the air.
[00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:02.840]   So it's great to hear you guys again.
[00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:04.200]   I have a question for you.
[00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:06.560]   It's about the Marantz Digital Audio Recorders.
[00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:10.720]   I've been thinking about getting one of these for a little while now because my microphone
[00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:16.320]   is rather close to my Power Mac G5 and when those nine fans or whatever, how many fans
[00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:20.040]   are in that computer turn on, it sounds like a jet airline about to take off right next
[00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:21.040]   to me.
[00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:24.040]   The solid state would be a little quieter.
[00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:29.800]   So anyway, if you have any insight on either of the PMD660 which is a little handheld or
[00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:34.840]   the PMD 671 which is the 24-bit version, that'd be great.
[00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:35.840]   Thanks.
[00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:36.840]   Keep up the great show.
[00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:39.960]   I should mention that Mark has been on the screensavers.
[00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:41.360]   I don't know if I can say who he works for.
[00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:46.720]   I think he always wanted to make that anonymous but it's a big media company in the Southland.
[00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:47.720]   He does some cool stuff.
[00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:49.240]   Yeah, really nice to hear from you, Mark.
[00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:52.480]   There's two basic differences between those Marantz Recorders he was mentioning.
[00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:57.400]   So for those of you who aren't tuned in to that, we use Marantz Recorders, Digital Recorders
[00:32:57.400 --> 00:33:01.800]   as portable units and as our local units when we're doing multi-track, when we're creating
[00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:03.600]   multi-tracks and for field units.
[00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:05.080]   And we're using it right now to record this.
[00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:06.080]   Exactly.
[00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:11.480]   So the larger unit which is considerably more expensive has about 42,000 different compression
[00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:12.480]   options.
[00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:13.880]   Yeah, look at the buttons.
[00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:14.880]   Yeah.
[00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:22.040]   And the biggest difference is the more portable unit which is about half the size of the 660
[00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:27.600]   is essentially it offers the wave format or the PMD file.
[00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:28.600]   PMD is at the right.
[00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:30.400]   I can never remember that one.
[00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:31.960]   What's a raw PCM?
[00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:34.360]   PCM, I can't remember PCM.
[00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:38.280]   And it offers a basic MP3 compression and nothing else.
[00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:47.160]   Now the big one does MP2 which I thought why do MP2, it's not MP2 video, it's MP2 layer
[00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:49.840]   two as opposed to MP3.
[00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:52.440]   It's another form of compression.
[00:33:52.440 --> 00:34:00.200]   Turns out NPR uses MP1 layer two for all of its network stuff.
[00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:03.720]   And so I suggested we try it and I tell you the quality was terrible.
[00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:07.080]   I was very disappointed MP3 is so much better.
[00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:09.120]   And we record this usually as wave audio.
[00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:11.440]   I think it's a, I like these devices don't you?
[00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:12.440]   Now you have the little one.
[00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:13.440]   And the little one.
[00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:14.440]   Yeah.
[00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:18.560]   I mean basically either record it raw which is what was that?
[00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:19.560]   Okay.
[00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:21.480]   Who turned off their phone.
[00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:23.800]   That was mine.
[00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:26.200]   Tell me how it works now.
[00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:27.200]   So cute.
[00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:29.000]   What's your ringtone Yoshi?
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   It's just work.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:31.880]   I just have the normal ringer.
[00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:35.560]   I'm actually trying to get a new phone because I'm very unhappy with T-Mobile and my current
[00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:36.560]   phone.
[00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:40.800]   I'm walking around and here's somebody's phone going, "Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding,
[00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:42.320]   ding, ding, ding, ding, ding."
[00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:46.760]   Now the old Nokia ring I go, "Get a new ringtone."
[00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:48.960]   I don't know.
[00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:53.240]   The 660, if you're just too important about recording the 660's great, the 670 offers
[00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:55.920]   a whole bunch more compression formats that you'll never use.
[00:34:55.920 --> 00:35:00.840]   Yeah the 671, if you're like a taper, if you miss the days of sitting in the audience
[00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:04.280]   at a Grateful Dead show and trying to get perfect quality then yeah, go for the 24-bit
[00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:06.560]   96 kilohertz compression that it offers.
[00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:08.040]   If you're a nogra kind of guy.
[00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:09.400]   If you're a nogra guy that guy.
[00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:14.680]   If you even know what nogra is, you should probably get that.
[00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:17.320]   Let's frugal the 671, but that's really expensive.
[00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:18.640]   I didn't know that it was.
[00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:19.640]   $1,000.
[00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:20.640]   Wow.
[00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:22.600]   That sounds like it's more for a studio environment.
[00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:29.000]   Yeah, the 670 is like 600 bucks and then the 660's that most of us are using which offer
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.080]   that much limited options are 499.
[00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:32.440]   I think that's overpriced frankly.
[00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:34.440]   I mean what it's in here, not much, right?
[00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:37.080]   Well it's the quality of the DSP.
[00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:43.760]   It's certainly not for the incredibly sublime and easy to grok in his face.
[00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:46.280]   Yeah, not fan for the in-face baby.
[00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:49.400]   I know once I set it up I never played with it again.
[00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:53.880]   Yeah, basically the 660's like 128 kilobits stereo or 64 kilobits mono.
[00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:55.320]   I don't think you need all of those.
[00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:56.320]   I mean all the other ones.
[00:35:56.320 --> 00:36:00.360]   If you can do uncompressed wave and you can do MP3, what else do you need?
[00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:03.600]   Frankly you were because you don't have a big card yet.
[00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:06.840]   Recording on MP3 I couldn't tell a different set of this as good as the waves.
[00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:08.760]   Frank, we should all just be recording MP3.
[00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:10.000]   I don't think it'd be really about it.
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:11.600]   We'll work on that in the future.
[00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:12.840]   Good day, Twits.
[00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:14.200]   It's lucky Phil from Sydney, Australia.
[00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:16.160]   I have a question about YMAX.
[00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:19.280]   In the area of Sydney that I'm in I can't get cable or DSL internet.
[00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:22.960]   However I have a broadband connection through a service called iBirst.
[00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:26.120]   It's a variant of the 3G network from what I can gather.
[00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:27.880]   It's based out of mobile phone towers.
[00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:29.240]   I find it's pretty fast.
[00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:31.320]   It's pretty reliable.
[00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:35.000]   I can basically go anywhere in Sydney, bar a few pockets.
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:39.840]   I have an always on stable, steady neck connection.
[00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:44.800]   It's also quite cheap considering I'm on a unlimited downloads plan for a set fee per
[00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:45.800]   month.
[00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:51.520]   I'd love to know why this service isn't being proposed or used in the States as opposed
[00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:58.000]   to the proposed YMAX which is being tested and experimented on etc.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.080]   I love the show you guys put on.
[00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:05.720]   I love seeing Leo Le Porte on the Houtes Channel every night at 10.30 and keep up the great
[00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:06.720]   work.
[00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:07.720]   Do you know that?
[00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:08.720]   I'm a star in Australia.
[00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:14.080]   Sorry, I'm just thinking of Canadian Paul who's an Australian friend of mine.
[00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:15.080]   That's confusing.
[00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:17.680]   Who's in Australia right now?
[00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:18.680]   It's really interesting.
[00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:23.120]   Actually there's two companies that are really, I don't know if they're battling it
[00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:24.120]   out yet.
[00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:28.600]   There's I-Burs and Unwired in Australia.
[00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:36.120]   It's interesting because my understanding was that I-Burs was using a variation of a pre-YMAX.
[00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:39.240]   What they are doing is basically they've picked a whole bunch of cell towers and they're making
[00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:44.440]   it available and then as the demand goes up they basically installing more of these transmitters
[00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:46.440]   on more of these towers.
[00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:47.640]   Intel's really interested in that.
[00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:51.200]   Again I'm not sure if it's I-Burs or Unwired but Intel's really interested because this
[00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:56.600]   is a model for how YMAX could become financially popular.
[00:37:56.600 --> 00:38:01.160]   So YMAX, basically fixed YMAX is going to come out in the United States at the end of this
[00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:03.360]   year, maybe beginning of 2006.
[00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:07.640]   The Unwired version is going to be about a year after that.
[00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:14.320]   I would probably, in the States, part of the problem is it's going to be interesting to
[00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:17.920]   watch because the cell companies have things so tied up here.
[00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:22.960]   A lot of people are saying 3G is just going to roll right over the top of YMAX and YMAX
[00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:28.360]   is going to be popular in a few areas where cable and DSL either aren't there or just
[00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:30.360]   don't work well.
[00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:33.680]   Boy, and then I lost my train of thought.
[00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:38.200]   They're lucky in Australia they've got a DSL2 which is I think Big Pond is rolling
[00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:40.920]   that out and that's great too.
[00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:44.040]   What I love to see is the competition.
[00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:45.040]   That's the key for me.
[00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:52.000]   I'm happy here I'm getting great DSL service and DSL providers upped the limit on DSL because
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:53.560]   they wanted to compete with cable monums.
[00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:56.680]   That's great and I think you want to see more of that.
[00:38:56.680 --> 00:38:57.680]   What do you use, David?
[00:38:57.680 --> 00:38:58.760]   Are you DSL?
[00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:01.080]   I still use my neighbors.
[00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:03.360]   I knew that.
[00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:05.360]   I'm just testing you.
[00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:06.920]   What do you got?
[00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:10.560]   E-D-O on your Verizon phone, don't you, Greg?
[00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:16.600]   Back when I was working at G4 we did a thing using the 3G solution on the CDMA.
[00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:18.000]   On the kite, right?
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   Yeah.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   Yeah.
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:21.480]   It was great the download speed.
[00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:24.800]   I mean it was great compared to any kind of dial up.
[00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:26.960]   I'm sure why I'm actually kicked the crap out of it.
[00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:29.840]   Hey, we never finished our free broadband stuff.
[00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:34.920]   So now I know one more free broadband thing that Prager does which is steal it.
[00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:36.920]   I mean borrow it.
[00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:38.800]   You might be more than willing.
[00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:40.000]   I have no idea though I didn't ask.
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   You've never asked.
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:45.080]   What he doesn't know won't hurt him.
[00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:49.160]   What are some free broadband things you like to do Robert?
[00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:53.080]   Well just in terms of like sites to go or maybe applications.
[00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:55.640]   This guy in Malaysia is getting high speed.
[00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:56.920]   What should he do right away?
[00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:57.920]   What's the first thing he's doing?
[00:39:57.920 --> 00:39:59.440]   Download lots and lots of cool software.
[00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:00.440]   I mean there's...
[00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:01.440]   That's true.
[00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:05.680]   Open source source forage.net, fresh meat.net, fresh meat.net.
[00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:08.720]   Start looking at the open source projects, open office.org if you don't want to spend
[00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:13.160]   money for micro-source-weighted install Linux.
[00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:16.080]   Yeah try a different Linux district.
[00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:17.080]   Yeah, totally.
[00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:18.800]   And a nice large download.
[00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:23.120]   I use the ASUS network boot so it's a small download.
[00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:27.360]   You boot up and then it downloads the stuff that you tell it to install and that's a nice
[00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:29.000]   thing to do on broadband and be able to...
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:31.320]   Gen 2 also will do that way.
[00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:32.880]   I think that's a great way to go.
[00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:34.200]   Bootstrap it up off broadband.
[00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:35.200]   I believe that.
[00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:41.280]   Probably my favorite thing is using an application like Keyhole or what is it?
[00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:42.280]   Keyhole.com?
[00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:43.480]   Did it mean the maps?
[00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:44.480]   Mm-hmm.
[00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:49.840]   We have a real-time Google just recently bought them out and it's a free trial software but
[00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:56.440]   it streams in real-time information including maps and satellite pictures over a virtual
[00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:58.200]   globe you can just spin around with the mouse.
[00:40:58.200 --> 00:41:00.920]   And it's data rich so you do need broadband to do that.
[00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:01.920]   Definitely.
[00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:06.440]   If you have a good graphics card it really helps too because it's amazing the level of
[00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:10.000]   detail you can scroll in and out of.
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:11.480]   It's also amazing I think.
[00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:13.400]   I think about it here old greet.
[00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:19.280]   Just being able to browse the web at broadband speeds even for normal text pages.
[00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:21.480]   It makes everything go so much faster.
[00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:22.480]   Lacency.
[00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:25.480]   It spoils you too because you don't ever want to go back.
[00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:26.480]   Right.
[00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:30.760]   It don't feel too demo as 550 megs or however big it was.
[00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:31.760]   You know.
[00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:32.760]   Enjoy those demos.
[00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:33.760]   That's another one.
[00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:34.760]   Download video game demos.
[00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:35.760]   Play video game.
[00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:36.760]   Play online.
[00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:37.760]   Yeah.
[00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:38.760]   Play online.
[00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:40.320]   I like the not being frustrated with downloads.
[00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:43.760]   Personally I hit a website if it's not up within 10 seconds I close the page.
[00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:44.760]   Yeah.
[00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:45.760]   Yeah.
[00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:46.760]   We're spoiled.
[00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:49.080]   I think that really content is the key.
[00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:52.720]   I mean podcasts are really practical on dial up.
[00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:55.760]   You've got to have broadband to listen to.
[00:41:55.760 --> 00:42:02.120]   I mean that video system that kind of stuff you can't do with out broadband and I think
[00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:03.120]   that's the future.
[00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:04.120]   We're going to get so much to be.
[00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:05.120]   I'm mostly tasking too.
[00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:07.920]   Being able to download while you can continue to surf web pages.
[00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:08.920]   Oh you're right.
[00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:09.920]   Yeah.
[00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:10.920]   Or Skype while you're Skyping.
[00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:11.920]   I'm downloading right now.
[00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:12.920]   I mean I don't know.
[00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:13.920]   I don't know.
[00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:14.920]   Five or six torrents going.
[00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:17.640]   The modem is really limiting to one task at a time online.
[00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:18.640]   That's really true.
[00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:19.640]   Yeah.
[00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:20.880]   Well it's what's my question is.
[00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:23.960]   Have you tried to use Ventrilo to communicate over the internet?
[00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:29.560]   I play a lot of competitive games like Counter-Strike and my clan uses it exclusively for voice
[00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:30.560]   communication.
[00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:31.560]   My clan.
[00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:32.560]   Yes.
[00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:34.360]   I spend a lot of time in Dungeons and Dragons.
[00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:35.360]   Hey I have a clan.
[00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:36.360]   I have a clan too.
[00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:38.160]   I'm in trouble.
[00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:39.160]   I'm sorry.
[00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:40.760]   It's just I'm too old.
[00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:41.760]   It's a group of friends.
[00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:46.520]   A clan is either a group of skinheads or it's a group of people who play online games
[00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:47.520]   as a team.
[00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:48.520]   I've got to be a ladder.
[00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:49.520]   I'm going to go with the ladder.
[00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:50.520]   Yeah.
[00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:52.360]   I'm going to be careful what I say.
[00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:54.360]   So Robert has a Ventrilo server.
[00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:55.360]   Is that your favorite?
[00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:59.760]   You know you were the one who taught me, who turned me on to what was the first?
[00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:00.760]   Roger Wilko.
[00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:01.760]   Roger Wilko.
[00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:02.760]   Yeah.
[00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:03.760]   Back in the day.
[00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:04.760]   Back in the day.
[00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:06.560]   And that would allow you to talk to each other while you're doing online gaming which
[00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:08.560]   really is important on team games like Counter-Strike.
[00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:12.160]   And I believe the games spike group ended up purchasing the minutes to Roger Wilko and
[00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:14.160]   I'm sure they're bundling that with their stuff.
[00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:15.160]   Is Ventrilo the best?
[00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:18.160]   It's the one I've been using the longest.
[00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:25.360]   It seems to take up the least amount of overhead on the server side and server apps are written
[00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:28.400]   in practically every OS that's popular right now.
[00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:32.040]   The problem being is the client side where it's only Windows.
[00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:33.040]   Right.
[00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:34.040]   Right now.
[00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:38.800]   But for gaming I use it for every modern game out there with no problem whatsoever.
[00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:40.760]   And it's very good sound quality.
[00:43:40.760 --> 00:43:41.760]   We've been playing.
[00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:42.760]   We've played with team speak.
[00:43:42.760 --> 00:43:43.760]   We'll probably play with Ventrilo.
[00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:48.560]   They're really not designed for what we do which is kind of all talking together.
[00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:55.400]   They're designed for kind of one off, you know, I'm killing you.
[00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:56.400]   Kind of stuff.
[00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:57.400]   Follow me.
[00:43:57.400 --> 00:43:58.400]   Follow me.
[00:43:58.400 --> 00:43:59.400]   Eat rocket, Wiesel.
[00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:02.280]   Get in the tank, damn it.
[00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:03.680]   I have a Linux box.
[00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:07.520]   This is the old dual processor server where you were mocking me for last week and I'm going
[00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:10.600]   to put, I've been in contact with the folks at asterisk.
[00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:11.600]   Digium.
[00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:15.840]   And I'm going to put asterisk on here which is a Linux open source PBX software.
[00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:17.600]   Basically a home brew PBX.
[00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:18.600]   Yeah.
[00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:20.680]   And they're sending me two cards.
[00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:24.040]   One that will get it to the POTS line and one that will get it onto the Internet.
[00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:28.760]   So once I get that set up we're going to use this, we're going to try it anyway.
[00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:30.880]   I think you could put higher quality codecs in there.
[00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:31.880]   Right.
[00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:34.120]   We're going to try it as a voice conferencing system for trade.
[00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:38.120]   So we should point out basically you're about to become your own telephone system.
[00:44:38.120 --> 00:44:39.120]   Yeah.
[00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:42.560]   And once I set it up and we'll all have voice mail boxes on here.
[00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:44.760]   We could use it as a central system for all of us.
[00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:51.000]   And then you can use a SIP phone, a voice over Internet interface to plug in anywhere
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:54.200]   and go through this and you'll be making a local call from here.
[00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:55.680]   Oh wow.
[00:44:55.680 --> 00:44:58.680]   So this will be, that's going to be something we're going to try out.
[00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:00.280]   I'm really interested in it.
[00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:06.360]   I have heard mixed opinions about whether it'll work for the Twitcast.
[00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:08.960]   It's definitely a favorite of people for PBX.
[00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:10.680]   I mean it's just amazing.
[00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:13.120]   Open source Linux based.
[00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:14.160]   So I have a SUS on here.
[00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:17.240]   They said we like it if you put Debian, it's probably on a prop with Debian on it.
[00:45:17.240 --> 00:45:19.800]   People are also using it to hat color ID.
[00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:21.640]   Oh, it's all sorts of things you can do with it.
[00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:23.880]   I mean yeah, you have a PBX.
[00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:27.120]   And they're going to send me the hardware interface so that it'll interface out to the
[00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:29.920]   POTS system which should be very handy.
[00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:31.840]   So Ventrilo, that's a good choice.
[00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:33.560]   I don't know if it's right for the Twitcast.
[00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:37.680]   Actually, Skype's been doing pretty, the only problem I have with Skype is we can only get
[00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:38.680]   five people on.
[00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:42.520]   I think that seems to be the problem with all of them we've tried so far is that once
[00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:45.480]   you get past a certain number, three is fine.
[00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:49.360]   Three we've had very well duplex conversations.
[00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:51.000]   We can talk over each other very well.
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:54.040]   But as soon as you get into four and five people, I think that's where a lot of it starts
[00:45:54.040 --> 00:45:55.040]   falling apart.
[00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:56.600]   This is working much better than it's ever worked before.
[00:45:56.600 --> 00:45:57.600]   Yes.
[00:45:57.600 --> 00:45:58.600]   Now this Skype.
[00:45:58.600 --> 00:46:01.800]   Partly because Patrick's in studio, so there's only, really there's only four of us on Skype.
[00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:03.280]   But it's working well.
[00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:04.280]   I think it sounded good.
[00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:05.280]   Good afternoon you Twits.
[00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:07.840]   And that sounds so mean, doesn't it?
[00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:08.840]   Yeah.
[00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:11.040]   Hey, this is Scott Whitlow from Indianapolis, Indiana.
[00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:12.880]   First of all, I've got to say love you guys are so.
[00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:15.080]   Listen to it all the time.
[00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:17.880]   My question is about a Linksys router that I have.
[00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:22.120]   I have a Linksys wireless router upstairs.
[00:46:22.120 --> 00:46:26.120]   And downstairs I have a PowerBook G4 that I use to connect, of course, wirelessly to
[00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:27.760]   the internet.
[00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:33.640]   However, from time to time periodically it just conks out on me.
[00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:36.760]   The internet connection does from the wireless router.
[00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:42.440]   The actual internet connection itself is still alive on the cable modem.
[00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:45.400]   I can also access to the desktop computer upstairs.
[00:46:45.400 --> 00:46:48.560]   However, my PowerBook does not connect to the internet anymore.
[00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:54.400]   I'm wondering what kind of steps I can take to avoid the situation.
[00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:58.360]   Once I unplug the router, plug it back in, it works fine again.
[00:46:58.360 --> 00:47:02.240]   So just give me some suggestions on where to start looking.
[00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:03.240]   Thanks a lot.
[00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:04.240]   Love you guys show.
[00:47:04.240 --> 00:47:05.480]   Bye.
[00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:07.400]   That was a problem on Windows.
[00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:09.680]   Still is with wireless zero config.
[00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:14.200]   And the easy to fix on Windows, it's a XP service.
[00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:15.600]   If you disable that service.
[00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:21.520]   What was happening is Microsoft thought, well let's make it easier to join a Wi-Fi network.
[00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:26.320]   It will put zero config in so it will just spy the network and join it transparently.
[00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:31.080]   The problem is if there are other networks in the area it starts to hunt and you lose
[00:47:31.080 --> 00:47:32.080]   it.
[00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:35.840]   We had a problem in my neighborhood where there's like literally somewhere between
[00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:40.120]   three and fifteen wireless networks going on depending on what time of day it is.
[00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:43.040]   So it starts roaming and you lose your connection.
[00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:46.520]   So on Windows for sure turn off wireless zero config.
[00:47:46.520 --> 00:47:47.960]   He said it was happening on a Mac.
[00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:52.960]   I've never had that.
[00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:56.160]   I can get on any network and it will be rock solid.
[00:47:56.160 --> 00:47:57.800]   I'm not sure.
[00:47:57.800 --> 00:47:59.640]   Update the firmware of that router first.
[00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:00.640]   You think it's the router?
[00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:01.640]   I've actually.
[00:48:01.640 --> 00:48:06.760]   Nine times out of ten there's been another update for a fix that there is always a fix
[00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:07.760]   for a router.
[00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:08.760]   It's worth it's worth it.
[00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:10.280]   I mean you should definitely agree.
[00:48:10.280 --> 00:48:14.040]   Definitely update the router but updating the router is probably not going to fix this particular
[00:48:14.040 --> 00:48:15.040]   one.
[00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:19.760]   Especially on the Windows machines it will hunt all day long.
[00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:21.320]   Yeah it's a real problem.
[00:48:21.320 --> 00:48:24.360]   See that's one nice thing about at least on my IBM notebook and the tools that they
[00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:27.200]   provide it's one side.
[00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:28.920]   There's two utilities that they use together.
[00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:32.760]   One allows me to connect to turn the wireless on and off very easily but the second one
[00:48:32.760 --> 00:48:37.440]   gives me all the wireless access points I've ever visited and it only looks for those particular
[00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:38.440]   ones.
[00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:39.440]   Right.
[00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:40.600]   And I can connect to those in and out.
[00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:42.600]   So you use the IBM.
[00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:45.280]   Everybody gets really two.
[00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:46.920]   If you have SP2 anyway.
[00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:51.160]   XPSP2 gets two Wi-Fi tools.
[00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:53.960]   One that provided by Windows and one provided by your chipset.
[00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:56.640]   And you and manufacturer you like the IBM one.
[00:48:56.640 --> 00:48:57.640]   Totally.
[00:48:57.640 --> 00:49:00.760]   It gives me location profiles, network profiles.
[00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:04.680]   It makes going between work home and whether I'm wired or wireless.
[00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:06.960]   It just handles it all very very elegantly.
[00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:12.160]   I think if you turn off I mean I've been really I've used the one in Windows XP forever.
[00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:13.160]   It's pretty reliable.
[00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:14.160]   Me too.
[00:49:14.160 --> 00:49:19.520]   But turning off I mean basically going to services and change wireless zero config into manual
[00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:22.840]   and when it starts up and that'll prevent it from automatically logging.
[00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:23.840]   Is this Patrick?
[00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:25.000]   Is this on the HP here?
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:28.040]   Is this Windows or is that the HP?
[00:49:28.040 --> 00:49:29.040]   That's Windows.
[00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:30.480]   Yeah I think it does a good job.
[00:49:30.480 --> 00:49:31.480]   I've been happy with that.
[00:49:31.480 --> 00:49:32.960]   I'm happy with that.
[00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:36.480]   Actually you know what I'll send to Leo there's a really good webpage that shows how to turn
[00:49:36.480 --> 00:49:38.440]   off wireless zero configuration.
[00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:40.760]   Just going services it's pretty easy.
[00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:42.640]   Hello Leo and the Twit Crew.
[00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:48.560]   My name is Matt Ruxell and my question to you is how do you feel about BitTorrent being
[00:49:48.560 --> 00:49:55.280]   a distributor of Spyware and do you still advocate using it to download your program?
[00:49:55.280 --> 00:49:56.280]   Hell yeah.
[00:49:56.280 --> 00:49:59.040]   Okay let's let's let's take a look at something.
[00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:00.040]   Yeah.
[00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:01.040]   There's something you think is wrong with that.
[00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:03.920]   Yeah it's the official paranoia in here and it's the person who actually is never downloaded
[00:50:03.920 --> 00:50:08.960]   MP3's or videos you know from any of this peer to peer sites.
[00:50:08.960 --> 00:50:12.040]   BitTorrent isn't a system for distributing Spyware.
[00:50:12.040 --> 00:50:14.600]   Now mean people will use it.
[00:50:14.600 --> 00:50:16.520]   It's a system for distributing Spyware.
[00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:18.320]   But it requires cooperation on your part.
[00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:19.880]   You've got to go out there and take it.
[00:50:19.880 --> 00:50:20.880]   Yes.
[00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:22.640]   If you're only getting the Twitcast you're not going to get Spyware.
[00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:26.040]   Well it's really horrible and I probably shouldn't say this out loud because there's
[00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:30.080]   going to be gasps all over the continental United States and apparently Penang, Indonesia
[00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:32.760]   and Sydney Australia.
[00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:36.520]   But if someone were to take and this is one of the things that's interesting about using
[00:50:36.520 --> 00:50:38.920]   BitTorrent they could take a copy of the Twitcast.
[00:50:38.920 --> 00:50:40.840]   And they could try to throw something in there.
[00:50:40.840 --> 00:50:44.800]   Now I don't think there's any MP3 player that is hackable to the point where I could
[00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:46.040]   do something particularly damaging.
[00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:49.320]   Well the thing is on that and BitTorrent does try to protect that.
[00:50:49.320 --> 00:50:51.960]   It does an MD5 hash on the file.
[00:50:51.960 --> 00:50:54.360]   The torrent file contains a hash.
[00:50:54.360 --> 00:50:58.480]   So I guess you could spoof the torrent file.
[00:50:58.480 --> 00:51:04.600]   If you come to Twit.tv well not today but in general if you come to the site that is
[00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:09.160]   providing the file and you download the torrent from that site unless they've done some sort
[00:51:09.160 --> 00:51:13.960]   of man in the middle attack or they're spoofing my site.
[00:51:13.960 --> 00:51:18.720]   I guess maybe I should get a certificate for Twit.tv and then you would know you were
[00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:19.720]   on Twit.tv.
[00:51:19.720 --> 00:51:20.720]   I'll do that.
[00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:25.360]   I'll make sure that's one way of validating that that's Twit.tv that you're on.
[00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:32.720]   Has anybody here ever, I know people who have downloaded, you know, been downloading applications
[00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:35.480]   and managing some really nasty spyware on their systems.
[00:51:35.480 --> 00:51:39.680]   Anybody here run into any kind of spyware on a download they've taken off of.
[00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:42.480]   If you go to Kazaar, LimeWire you're going to get it.
[00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:47.240]   Well my cousin who I built the system for he ended up installing a ROM pack full of games
[00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:54.760]   and within that ROM pack was a very very evil adware based system that was the removal
[00:51:54.760 --> 00:51:56.640]   of it was so convoluted.
[00:51:56.640 --> 00:51:58.160]   It's hard to get rid of it once you get it.
[00:51:58.160 --> 00:51:59.800]   Those things they're just.
[00:51:59.800 --> 00:52:01.480]   That's right a ghost image and I was like thank you.
[00:52:01.480 --> 00:52:04.960]   Let's just drop the DVD right in and re-imagine this thing right now.
[00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:06.920]   What were you going to say David?
[00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:11.240]   Oh well I was just making the simple comment that you know people seed the stuff that they
[00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:12.240]   like.
[00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:14.960]   I mean if you find someone that's seeded so many thousand times or even so many hundred
[00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:16.960]   times I would assume that I would be vidged.
[00:52:16.960 --> 00:52:17.960]   Scan it but I mean.
[00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:18.960]   Good point.
[00:52:18.960 --> 00:52:25.560]   That's a multiple versions of a file wherever you're looking at different torrents see which
[00:52:25.560 --> 00:52:28.280]   torrent is the most active as well.
[00:52:28.280 --> 00:52:31.920]   So I would say of all the people swarm to the quality.
[00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:34.920]   That's what David's saying if there's a lot of seeds you're safer.
[00:52:34.920 --> 00:52:40.000]   I would say of all the peer to peer file sharing systems torrent is the much by far the least
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:42.120]   likely to give you any bugs.
[00:52:42.120 --> 00:52:47.200]   I mean Kazan Limewire you're going to almost always get something but not a bit.
[00:52:47.200 --> 00:52:49.200]   Well you're saying what the installation of the application.
[00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:52.960]   No no no they have not even the applications just when you if you look if I'm a spyware
[00:52:52.960 --> 00:52:57.000]   author and I want to spread my spyware far and wide as possible I'm going to look at what
[00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:59.280]   the number one song is in the nation right now.
[00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:03.240]   I'm going to create a file that looks like that song you know Madonna's big hit dot in
[00:53:03.240 --> 00:53:07.440]   total three dot exe right and I'm going to put it out and make sure it's on all the file
[00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:11.240]   sharing networks and I'm a lot of people are going to download it and run it but that's
[00:53:11.240 --> 00:53:15.320]   not how torrent works you know you'd have to go to their site and download their torrent.
[00:53:15.320 --> 00:53:16.920]   I mean that's not going to happen.
[00:53:16.920 --> 00:53:18.440]   So I think I wouldn't worry about bittor.
[00:53:18.440 --> 00:53:22.080]   In fact I'm very happy if it weren't for bittor and I don't think we'd have half the
[00:53:22.080 --> 00:53:26.400]   listenership we do more than you know three quarters of the downloads are from bittor.
[00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:27.400]   Of this file.
[00:53:27.400 --> 00:53:30.600]   It's good more concerned about malicious websites.
[00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:31.600]   Yes.
[00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:33.200]   Doing things to your system right.
[00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:36.080]   It's just one bad site with the right browser.
[00:53:36.080 --> 00:53:37.080]   Boom.
[00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:39.200]   You're reinstalling windows.
[00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:45.600]   Hey we're out of time for this particular episode of this week in tech.
[00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:52.480]   Let's thank all of our gang here Robert Herron from San Francisco PC magazine's brilliant
[00:53:52.480 --> 00:53:55.280]   HDTV lab guy.
[00:53:55.280 --> 00:54:03.080]   Mr. Yoshi who is making special effects like making copies.
[00:54:03.080 --> 00:54:05.160]   And apparently has something to do with Spider-Man 3.
[00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:08.760]   Hey did you guys see Batman begins yet?
[00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:09.760]   No I haven't.
[00:54:09.760 --> 00:54:11.920]   Everyone I've talked to said it's amazing the best one yet.
[00:54:11.920 --> 00:54:12.920]   Oh I got to say it.
[00:54:12.920 --> 00:54:13.920]   I was bummed.
[00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:15.320]   They have it on the iMac's theater here in San Francisco.
[00:54:15.320 --> 00:54:16.320]   I was bummed.
[00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:17.320]   I want to go see it.
[00:54:17.320 --> 00:54:18.680]   It's on the iMac screen in Toronto.
[00:54:18.680 --> 00:54:20.920]   I bought a ticket online.
[00:54:20.920 --> 00:54:23.200]   And then I got caught up in something and I missed it.
[00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:24.200]   And I was.
[00:54:24.200 --> 00:54:26.200]   I was supposed to be there right now seeing it.
[00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:28.240]   I'm doing my doing my Twitter cast.
[00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:33.280]   I was editing the Twitter cast and that's you know that's the price you pay for fame.
[00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:37.160]   Mr. David Prager we don't hear enough from you please don't be a stranger now.
[00:54:37.160 --> 00:54:39.400]   Now that you're part of the system gang.
[00:54:39.400 --> 00:54:40.920]   Well thanks very much.
[00:54:40.920 --> 00:54:43.920]   And I'm glad you're moving up here because I think most you know this works great.
[00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:46.640]   I mean having Patrick in the same room is great.
[00:54:46.640 --> 00:54:49.120]   And I think the more that we can be together when we do this the better.
[00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:51.120]   Yeah and everybody.
[00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:52.320]   A lot of people moving north.
[00:54:52.320 --> 00:54:58.160]   Yeah that looks like San Francisco Bay Area is once again the happen in place.
[00:54:58.160 --> 00:55:03.200]   Yeah we're reuniting the screensavers cast bit by bit.
[00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:04.320]   Thank you everybody for your time.
[00:55:04.320 --> 00:55:05.320]   Have a great week.

[00:55:59.600 --> 00:56:01.600]   [Music]
[00:56:01.600 --> 00:56:03.600]   [Music]
[00:56:03.600 --> 00:56:05.600]   [Music]
[00:56:05.600 --> 00:56:07.600]   [Music]
[00:56:07.600 --> 00:56:09.600]   [Music]
[00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:11.600]   [Music]
[00:56:11.600 --> 00:56:13.600]   [Music]
[00:56:13.600 --> 00:56:15.600]   [Music]
[00:56:15.600 --> 00:56:17.600]   [Music]
[00:56:17.600 --> 00:56:19.600]   [Music]
[00:56:19.600 --> 00:56:21.600]   [Music]
[00:56:21.600 --> 00:56:23.600]   [Music]

[00:56:35.600 --> 00:56:37.600]   [Music]
[00:56:37.600 --> 00:56:39.600]   You guys should see this little Garrett office.
[00:56:39.600 --> 00:56:40.600]   This is the Twit office.
[00:56:40.600 --> 00:56:41.600]   This is epic.
[00:56:41.600 --> 00:56:42.600]   It is a Garrett, isn't it?
[00:56:42.600 --> 00:56:43.600]   Are you in Petaluma?
[00:56:43.600 --> 00:56:45.600]   Yes, I can see the McNeer building from the window.
[00:56:45.600 --> 00:56:46.600]   [Laughter]
[00:56:46.600 --> 00:56:47.600]   It's quite lovely.
[00:56:47.600 --> 00:56:55.600]   All this greenery and very black people are, the only thing is inside this is the hot room in the whole building because I'm generating all this.
[00:56:55.600 --> 00:56:59.600]   It's like, it's basically, it's a Victorian office.
[00:56:59.600 --> 00:57:01.600]   Somebody converted a Victorian sort of a chambered liquid.
[00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:03.600]   How did you see this?
[00:57:03.600 --> 00:57:04.600]   Your editor, your chairman's award.
[00:57:04.600 --> 00:57:05.600]   My chairman's circle award.
[00:57:05.600 --> 00:57:06.600]   I wanted one of those so bad.
[00:57:06.600 --> 00:57:07.600]   You never won one.
[00:57:07.600 --> 00:57:08.600]   You never won one.
[00:57:08.600 --> 00:57:09.600]   Patrick, you can have that one.
[00:57:09.600 --> 00:57:13.600]   It may say Leo the fourth, but Patrick's really a certain age.
[00:57:13.600 --> 00:57:14.600]   No, it's your favorite.
[00:57:14.600 --> 00:57:18.600]   So the chairman's circle award was the award for editorial excellence.
[00:57:18.600 --> 00:57:24.600]   Editorial excellence were sales excellence at the Zev Davis back in the day.
[00:57:24.600 --> 00:57:25.600]   This is history.
[00:57:25.600 --> 00:57:31.600]   The story about this is Bill McCrone designed this on a computer and then this made out of, I think, titanium.
[00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:32.600]   No.
[00:57:32.600 --> 00:57:33.600]   No?
[00:57:33.600 --> 00:57:34.600]   That would be an expensive.
[00:57:34.600 --> 00:57:35.600]   That would be really expensive.
[00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:36.600]   That would be really expensive.
[00:57:36.600 --> 00:57:37.600]   What is that steel?
[00:57:37.600 --> 00:57:38.600]   He had it.
[00:57:38.600 --> 00:57:39.600]   Patrick's licking it, ladies.
[00:57:39.600 --> 00:57:40.600]   [Laughter]
[00:57:40.600 --> 00:57:41.600]   This would be the side.
[00:57:41.600 --> 00:57:42.600]   What the?
[00:57:42.600 --> 00:57:43.600]   Lick it if I were you.
[00:57:43.600 --> 00:57:44.600]   Sorry.
[00:57:44.600 --> 00:57:48.600]   This is the banter that you'll hear so much about.
[00:57:48.600 --> 00:57:49.600]   This makes airtime.
[00:57:49.600 --> 00:57:50.600]   I will burn your house to the ground.
[00:57:51.600 --> 00:57:57.600]   [Silence]
