[00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.320]   because there's so much space news to talk about.
[00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.760]   But first we're going to talk about the Twitter whistleblower.
[00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.360]   We'll also talk about the last pass hack
[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.040]   and whether it's anything you should worry about.
[00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.520]   Mark Zuckerberg's interview with Joe Rogan.
[00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.920]   And then a look at Artemis 1 as America returns to the moon.
[00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.400]   It's all coming up next on Twit.

[00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.960]   It's time for "Twit" this week at Tech, the show we cover.

[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.720]   tuned in this show today because it's OG Twit Time.
[00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.200]   Becky Worley is here.
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.080]   My dear friend from ages gone by ABC News Technology
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.800]   and Consumer Correspondent.
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.160]   You see her all the time on Good Morning America
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.160]   and elsewhere on ABC.
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.880]   Hello, Becky.
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:45.600]   Hey, Leo.
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.560]   I was just trying to think.
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.840]   Well, have we known each other?
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:48.640]   98.
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.320]   So going on 24 years, stuff has been saying.
[00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.880]   It's kind of amazing.
[00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.040]   Yeah, we first met when you produced both the screensavers
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.240]   and call for help.
[00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:58.520]   I tech TV's debut.
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.880]   It was ZD TV back then.
[00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.520]   And you produced call for help for most of the show, I think.
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:06.120]   Yes.
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.120]   Yeah.
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.440]   And you wrote my recommendation letter to go to grad school.
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.440]   I had to get rid of her, so we sent her to Stanford.
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.760]   And you always give me credit for that,
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.760]   which is sad because I'm sure it didn't have anything
[00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:19.440]   to do with that.
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.360]   But I'm so glad you went.
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.800]   You studied educational technology, right?
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:24.440]   Yep.
[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.440]   And haven't really used much of it at all.
[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:27.240]   Not at all.
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.320]   No.
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:29.760]   But it was a good experience.
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.920]   It was certainly good to be in that environment.
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.240]   And I took a ton of computer science classes
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.640]   and human computing interface.
[00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.360]   And in a way, coming from a liberal arts background,
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.000]   it gave me sort of a deep breath.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.240]   Yeah, I can hang in this space.
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.560]   And I can participate.
[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.840]   And I learned a lot about cognition, which
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.040]   is huge when you're trying to communicate in any medium.
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.480]   So in the minute and a half that I get for an ABC GMA story,
[00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.600]   knowing how to get my message across that,
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.200]   I learned a lot in grad school.
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.320]   They make you do some strange things.
[00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.520]   Last thing I saw you had all these sensors on you.
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.560]   You were all wired up for--
[00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:10.880]   was it sleep testing?
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:11.320]   What was it?
[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:11.920]   Yes.
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.440]   I was testing the Aura Fitbit and the Samsung Galaxy Watch,
[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.280]   how they monitor your sleep and report your REM stages,
[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.480]   your deep, how long you slept, how long it took you
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:23.640]   to fall asleep.
[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.040]   And we tested those against a standard sleep study,
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.680]   something you might go do if you have
[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.480]   restless leg syndrome or sleep apnea,
[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.000]   to see how those mirrored up.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.280]   And it was super interesting.
[00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.840]   That's what I love about my job,
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.600]   is that I get access to these incredible tools, facilities,
[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:45.080]   institutions, and can use them to get information
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.760]   about consumer tech that you wouldn't normally get.
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.440]   Yeah, this is something I, for instance,
[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.240]   we always would like to do, but don't have the resources
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.880]   to do it.
[00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.640]   So how accurate are those devices?
[00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.440]   Well, it hasn't aired yet, so I can't give you
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.280]   a few details.
[00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.200]   But thank you for the tease.
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.160]   When is that going to be on this week?
[00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.960]   It's going to be on, I think, in October,
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.160]   we've been doing this series about biohacking
[00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.080]   called the Science of You.
[00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.920]   And I have loved it.
[00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.720]   And I want to talk a little bit later, if you want to,
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.800]   about continuous glucose monitoring apps.
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:23.560]   Oh, I'm wearing a CGM right now.
[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.880]   And see, and you know what's interesting,
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.400]   it was not prescribed by my doctor.
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.280]   It was something I saw on Instagram.
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.280]   We'll talk about that.
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:34.800]   We'll talk about that.
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:35.640]   Okay, yeah.
[00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.560]   It was an awesome question to the Instagram ads.
[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.800]   Yeah, I'm a sucker for those.
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:44.040]   But I am type two diabetes diagnosed a few years ago.
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:46.880]   And I've been doing fingerprints just every once in a while.
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.480]   And I thought, hey, that's kind of cool.
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.120]   If I could continuously monitor this,
[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.200]   this is the Abbott product.
[00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.440]   And it is very, well, we'll talk about it.
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:57.520]   That's cool.
[00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:58.680]   Anyway, it's great to see Becky.
[00:05:58.680 --> 00:05:59.520]   - We're going right here, so we'll talk about it.
[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.680]   - Becky's always here when I'm not here.
[00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:05.120]   She's our kind of our preferred filling host.
[00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.360]   So it's nice to have us both in the same room,
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:08.200]   at the same time.
[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:12.040]   - We respect the perhaps we were the same person.
[00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:13.160]   - Same, same.
[00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:14.760]   - Now we know. (laughs)
[00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:17.160]   Also with us, hey, I haven't seen Will Harris
[00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.040]   in a long time.
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:22.880]   He's got a new job every time I see Will.
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:23.720]   He's got a new job.
[00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:25.880]   Hi, Will, welcome back.
[00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:27.560]   - Hey, it's good to be with you.
[00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.320]   It's a fabulous Sunday evening here.
[00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.480]   I always love doing Twit.
[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:34.320]   Obviously we kick off about sort of-
[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:35.160]   - It's middle of the night.
[00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:36.160]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:37.320]   - Over here in London.
[00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:38.840]   So tomorrow is a national holiday,
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:40.200]   so I get to stay in bed in the morning.
[00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:41.040]   - Oh!
[00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:43.120]   - So we can go for however long, you know, it's all good.
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.480]   - What day is tomorrow?
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:46.560]   - Monday, Leo.
[00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.320]   - Is that a national holiday now?
[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:50.240]   (laughs)
[00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.200]   I think that's a great idea.
[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:54.560]   - We have like a national holiday for the end of summer.
[00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:58.320]   It officially is like, you know, when the misery begins.
[00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.760]   - Is it like St. Stephen's mid-summer day
[00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:01.600]   or something like that?
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:02.440]   I mean, what's-
[00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:03.600]   - I mean something like that, yeah.
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:04.600]   - Okay. (laughs)
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.200]   - I like that you're translating Will
[00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:09.840]   and calling it a national holiday and not a bank holiday.
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:11.040]   (laughs)
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:13.560]   - You know, I know my audience.
[00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:17.000]   But yeah, as Leo said, I think every time I come on,
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.280]   I've not quite every time I come on.
[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:22.240]   But it's lovely to be here.
[00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:25.960]   Yeah, I have a fantastic new gig at Unbound.com.
[00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:28.200]   - This is really cool. - It's a really interesting book.
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:29.200]   - Oh, this is so cool.
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:32.000]   So it's your publisher.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   And the books are very nerdy,
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   very interesting and crowd-funded.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.400]   - But yeah, so the kind of idea is that like,
[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.560]   whereas most publishers, you know,
[00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:46.200]   they publish quite mainstream stuff
[00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:49.040]   'cause you need to be able to guarantee the return
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:50.720]   that you'll get and guarantee that you're gonna get it
[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:53.560]   into Barnes and Noble, we are able to do much more
[00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:56.680]   interesting and some slightly geeky things
[00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:59.160]   because we crowdfund the first printing
[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:00.600]   of all the books that we do.
[00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:03.000]   So you've got some fantastic books around
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.760]   the making of the Resident Evil series,
[00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:08.760]   the making of Alien Isolation,
[00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:09.960]   which I think most people consider
[00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:12.320]   to be the scariest video game ever made.
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:14.680]   - The Gothic cookbook.
[00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:16.560]   - The Gothic cookbook if you're feeling
[00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:20.240]   a little bit miserable, but also kind of kitchenette.
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:22.160]   - But this is the one the audience is gonna be
[00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:24.520]   most interested in.
[00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:27.200]   Douglas Adams, who passed away some years ago,
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:29.480]   creator of Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,
[00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:31.640]   we didn't expect any new Douglas Adams books,
[00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:32.640]   but there is one.
[00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:37.000]   - Yeah, so we worked with the Douglas Adams estate,
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   so we have a book called 42,
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.240]   and it's all the kind of stuff that was left
[00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:44.880]   lying around Douglas Adams's office when he died.
[00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:46.720]   - Oh Lord. - So there are post-it notes.
[00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:48.880]   - Oh, this is my worst nightmare.
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:52.160]   - Published, yeah, unpublished kind of memos,
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:55.520]   some wedding speeches, papers that he had kind of kicking
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:58.320]   around, so we collated, they're sort of,
[00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:00.760]   each page is a facsimile of something interesting
[00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:03.800]   from his office, scripts, jokes, speeches to do lists,
[00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:05.480]   bowings, - Oh, Douglas Adams
[00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:06.400]   - On set of films. - On set of films.
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:07.120]   - Would flip open. - Yeah,
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:10.720]   Douglas Adams fans, it's the last kind of
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:16.040]   trove of material from him, so we have that coming out.
[00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:19.440]   You can pre-order it now and get supporter editions,
[00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:20.280]   the beginning and next year.
[00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:22.840]   - I just wanna say, if you do this after my death
[00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:25.240]   and you find the Bitcoin password,
[00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:28.240]   I would really appreciate it if you would not publish that.
[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:30.280]   Until my state got ahold of it.
[00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:31.960]   Okay, just saying, just saying.
[00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:32.800]   This looks cool.
[00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:35.240]   You are offering our audience an offer code.
[00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:36.320]   I just wanted to mention this up.
[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:38.520]   - Yeah, for a while, thank you, you're very kind.
[00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:40.040]   If anybody wants to go and grab a book,
[00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:43.160]   if they wanna grab 42 or all the Resident Evil
[00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:48.160]   or Alien books, Twit 15 will get you 15% off any pledge.
[00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:50.560]   - Nice. - Check out it, so go and stick that in
[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:53.400]   and enjoy some nice books.
[00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:56.800]   - Thank you, Unbound.com.
[00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:59.240]   Every time you're here, you're having a different job,
[00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:01.080]   but they're always great, right?
[00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:02.960]   You're always doing some very interesting things.
[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:06.160]   This seems like a really interesting company
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:08.360]   to work for, Unbound thought.
[00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:11.680]   Come and look who the cat drug in.
[00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:14.040]   A third host, Rod made it.
[00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:16.640]   Rod, your sunburn from the North Pole.
[00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:18.560]   - Yeah, well, the sun doesn't set there.
[00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:22.120]   - Rod Pyle, he is a regular on our show,
[00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:25.120]   radio show the Tech Guy, a space reporter.
[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:27.360]   He's the host of this week in space,
[00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.880]   our program with Tarek Malek,
[00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:30.920]   who is the editor in chief at space.com.
[00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:32.920]   Rod is the editor in chief at Ad Astra,
[00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:35.720]   which is the national publication of the,
[00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:38.200]   it is the publication of the National Space Society,
[00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:41.280]   NSS.org, written a great many books.
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:42.600]   I'll bring the pile in.
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.320]   I'll have the pile brought in.
[00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:45.880]   The pile for later in the show.
[00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:46.760]   - Okay, that's fair.
[00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:49.520]   - But the pile pile, we call it.
[00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:54.520]   But you just came back from a month on Mars,
[00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:56.760]   that's what I called it, yeah.
[00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:00.040]   And it was extraordinary.
[00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:02.640]   - The Earth and the Arctic Circle, right?
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:05.280]   - Yeah, so we were up at about 15 degrees,
[00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:08.600]   or 75 degrees, sorry, 15 degrees out of the pole,
[00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:10.560]   which sounds like it's a fair distance away,
[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:13.800]   but the sun never set, it kind of skirted the horizon,
[00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:15.600]   which as I was mentioning to you earlier,
[00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:19.560]   for a photographer, you got sunset for three, four hours
[00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:20.400]   a night.
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:23.360]   - And NASA goes up there because it's like Mars.
[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:24.800]   - Yeah, so it's so close.
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:26.160]   I mean, there's no prochlorate,
[00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:28.120]   the soil is noxitizing like Mars,
[00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:29.240]   but it's gritty.
[00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:32.440]   It will kill you instantly is what you're saying.
[00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:35.200]   - Not like Mars, yeah, but it's cold all the time.
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:38.600]   The soil's very sharp and gritty, gets into everything.
[00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:40.440]   So it's a great place to test hardware.
[00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:42.200]   - Look at this, it's spacesuits.
[00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:47.320]   - This is Mars-like, I guess,
[00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:49.040]   'cause there's no animals or anything.
[00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:51.400]   And you guys are writing, instead of rovers,
[00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:53.960]   you're writing little Kawasaki ATVs.
[00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:57.400]   - Yeah, because they had two rovers up there,
[00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:59.920]   but they kept getting bogged down in the soft soil
[00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:00.760]   and so forth.
[00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:01.600]   - Oh.
[00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:06.440]   - So Pascal Lee, who runs this in conjunction with NASA,
[00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:09.320]   he's got a doctorate in planetary geology,
[00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:11.560]   works down at Ames and the SETI Institute,
[00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:16.720]   is a big advocate of using some kind of alternative ATV
[00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:17.560]   on Mars.
[00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:18.400]   - Nice.
[00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:20.360]   - The idea being the astronaut would have
[00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:22.800]   some of their life support on the ATV.
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:25.280]   So when you sat in the ATV, you'd have your space
[00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:26.560]   that plugged in and when you got off,
[00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:28.160]   it kind of fall everywhere you go.
[00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:29.520]   So that's why they experiment with the ATV.
[00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:30.520]   - They were testing that.
[00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:33.680]   - Yeah, and here's the gang up where the sun never
[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:34.600]   says the guy on the right,
[00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:36.480]   John Shoot looks like he actually lives up there.
[00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:38.560]   He's an amazing guy.
[00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:41.560]   He's crested four of the highest mountains on the planet.
[00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:44.320]   He's done 34 seasons in the Antarctic.
[00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:46.160]   - Yeah, it looks like, as an expedition leader,
[00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:48.040]   finding meteorites.
[00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:50.600]   And he just, if you didn't ask him about it,
[00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:51.800]   you'd figure he's just some guy
[00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:53.160]   with a lot of bus stop, you know?
[00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:56.400]   But he's started talking to him and he's astonishing.
[00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:57.160]   - What fun.
[00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:58.000]   - Yeah.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.080]   - Anyway, Rod is here because there's a lot of space
[00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:03.120]   to talk about, including tomorrow's big,
[00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:05.720]   well, at hoped big launch.
[00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:06.560]   - Crossing fingers.
[00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:08.000]   - Crossing our fingers.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   Anyway, what a great panel.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   Rod Pyle, Will Harris, Becky Worley.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.080]   Welcome to all three of you.
[00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:16.120]   I guess we'll kick off,
[00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:18.680]   there's so many stories we could start with.
[00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:22.080]   I think we should kick off with the Twitter whistleblower,
[00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:27.080]   Mudge, who worked briefly for, I think, for a year and a half,
[00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:36.040]   for Twitter as our second.
[00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:37.160]   - Yeah, bang on two years.
[00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:38.560]   - Almost two years.
[00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:41.800]   Peter Zatko, he was very well known.
[00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:45.200]   He was one of the members of the Cult of the Dead Cow Hacker
[00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:48.640]   Group testified to Congress as one of the members there.
[00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:53.320]   About hacking, he was at Loft, LOPHT, very well known hacking group.
[00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:55.200]   Later on, worked for the Department of Defense
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:59.480]   and other very respectable organizations in cybersecurity,
[00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:03.640]   was hired by Twitter right after they were hacked.
[00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:08.600]   Remember when Elon Musk and Barack Obama and Steve,
[00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:10.720]   Tim Cook, rather, as accounts were hacked,
[00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:13.400]   saying, "Hey, we want to give back."
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:17.000]   So if you give us some crypto, we will double it
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.560]   and give it back to you like any idiot would fall for that.
[00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:23.000]   But it was a massive hack of some of the best known accounts
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.560]   on Twitter, Twitter freaked out, hired Zatko.
[00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:31.880]   He was there almost two years, fired at the beginning of the year.
[00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:35.840]   According to Agrowal, after he did the whistleblower,
[00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:39.320]   he said, "Well, he was fired because he wasn't any good."
[00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:44.000]   He says that Twitter's security is terrible.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.760]   He said he tried for a long time to tell him
[00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:47.840]   they didn't listen.
[00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:52.840]   So six months after his firing, he became a whistleblower,
[00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:59.680]   sending information to the FTC, the SEC and others.
[00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:01.840]   Lots of stories have come out of that.
[00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:03.280]   I have to say, as soon as I read it,
[00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:10.440]   I said, "I want to know more before I believe everything he says."
[00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:11.800]   Can I ask a question?
[00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:12.640]   Go ahead, Becky.
[00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:15.520]   Because I was reading this and something that's--
[00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:18.200]   I was curious what exactly are the allegations
[00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:21.960]   that are being made around the security breaches and problems.
[00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:26.880]   And so he said there were no logs.
[00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:30.160]   And he specifically called out around January 6
[00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:32.760]   that there were no logs.
[00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:34.760]   Nobody knew where the data lived.
[00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:36.840]   Whether it was critical, all engineers
[00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:40.880]   had some form of critical access to the production environment.
[00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:48.600]   And if an internal engineer wanted to take over the platform,
[00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:49.320]   they could.
[00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:52.520]   And they wouldn't know where the attack was coming from.
[00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:55.000]   And there was no way to close that down.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.800]   Is that something that you think most companies do have?
[00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:00.400]   Well, maybe.
[00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:02.080]   Here's the irony of this.
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:05.360]   That was what he was hired to fix.
[00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:06.880]   This is exactly it, Leo.
[00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:08.440]   So you've got to nail on the head.
[00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:12.520]   So he comes in in 2020 in order to fix--
[00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:13.480]   Exactly that.
[00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:16.240]   You can probably all appreciate is a lot of Twitter security
[00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:16.720]   problems, right?
[00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:18.760]   As you pointed out, the hacking of Tim Cook,
[00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:21.320]   all his cybersecurity stuff, he then
[00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:24.640]   makes a big stink about the fact that following January 6,
[00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:29.520]   he was worried that somebody who was sympathetic to the January 6,
[00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:31.920]   quote unquote, "insurrection cause"
[00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:33.880]   could take over the platform and do something.
[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:35.640]   And you're like, well, dude, you've
[00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:37.720]   been there for a year and a half.
[00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:39.400]   Isn't that what you were supposed to be doing?
[00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:41.040]   He was literally brought in.
[00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:41.400]   Like you did.
[00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:43.320]   He worked that out a year and a half ago.
[00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:45.360]   That was your job.
[00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:48.640]   So, I mean, really, his complaint might be, well, I tried,
[00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:49.720]   and they wouldn't let me.
[00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:52.920]   I don't know if he said that specifically.
[00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:53.920]   He also said--
[00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:56.880]   So I think what he says is that a lot of the complaints
[00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:58.640]   that he had and a lot of the queries that he had--
[00:16:58.640 --> 00:16:59.040]   Worked on it.
[00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:02.720]   --basically got tied up in the kind of Twitter executive
[00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:06.160]   board, which was non-functioning because of the Dorsey--
[00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:07.280]   We know this, though.
[00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:09.880]   Twitter's had the most dysfunctional board history.
[00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:10.400]   Yeah.
[00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:12.360]   That is Twitter in a nutshell.
[00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:15.400]   That's our little dysfunctional friend.
[00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:19.760]   He said that Twitter was in violation of its FTC consent
[00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:24.960]   decree in 2011, the FTC, after a number of security problems,
[00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:27.480]   said, "You must establish and maintain
[00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:30.520]   a comprehensive information security program that
[00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:32.800]   will be assessed by an outside auditor.
[00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:34.880]   And you must not-- this is the best part.
[00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:39.840]   You must not lie to your users about your security."
[00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:42.280]   And he says, well, they didn't do either.
[00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:45.280]   Again, he was there.
[00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:46.000]   It's hard to know.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.280]   I mean, much is respectable and respected.
[00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:55.160]   So there is some concern that maybe the timing of this
[00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:59.160]   so close to Elon Musk's trial and chance
[00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:04.240]   to record in December, in October in Delaware, that maybe it
[00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:10.480]   was to support Elon's contention that there were too many bots
[00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:11.400]   on Twitter.
[00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:13.200]   Actually, there's a very good piece,
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:16.480]   which I recommend from our good friend Mike
[00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:19.640]   Masnick on Tech Dirt, in which he
[00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:23.760]   explains why the whistleblower report actually does not
[00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:26.320]   support Musk, even though it might seem to.
[00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:29.000]   It supports Twitter.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.120]   So I think, I mean, there is--
[00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:33.400]   I don't want to get too meta about this,
[00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:35.560]   but Becky will know as somebody who
[00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:37.760]   works in an immediate outlet.
[00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:40.760]   And I don't know Mike, and I don't know Tech Dirt very well.
[00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:43.440]   But it's very interesting to see what outlets run
[00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:45.800]   with what version of that story.
[00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:49.280]   And you can kind of guess who got the internal briefing
[00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:53.520]   from the Twitter PR, who got the internal briefing from the PR
[00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:56.080]   that Mudge clearly hired.
[00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:58.880]   Because the different angles on this story
[00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:02.040]   are really distinct.
[00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:04.080]   This guy was fighting his hardest
[00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:07.440]   to try and fix a broken culture within Twitter.
[00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:13.280]   Or this guy was absolutely an idiot who couldn't tie a shoelaces
[00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:16.400]   together and certainly couldn't fix anything
[00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:18.120]   inside a major corporation.
[00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:21.640]   And you go, well, those two things,
[00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:24.120]   two perspectives on possibly the same set of facts.
[00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:25.960]   But it's interesting to see who runs with Rott.
[00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:26.960]   With Rott.
[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:28.480]   I will defend Mike on this.
[00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:29.440]   He knows what he's talking about.
[00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:30.520]   Yeah, I didn't understand the story.
[00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:31.960]   Will you explain why it--
[00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:34.800]   I still don't understand why it supports Twitter.
[00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:37.040]   So that's because you're in the media, OK?
[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:38.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:39.160]   Hey, hey.
[00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:42.960]   The mainstream media is not telling the truth, Becky.
[00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:44.520]   That's because the media is unfortunately
[00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:47.040]   falling for the spin.
[00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:50.960]   So what Masik explains-- and this is God's truth.
[00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:52.520]   He's not making something up.
[00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:58.280]   It revolves around a misunder-- or either a misunderstanding
[00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:00.680]   intentional or accidental that Elon has about bots.
[00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:04.120]   And then Elon has intentionally confused the world about.
[00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:09.760]   It sounds like Elon is saying that the platform is more than 5%
[00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:14.200]   fake and that Twitter has been lying about that.
[00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:16.880]   That is, in fact, not what Twitter has ever said.
[00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:18.760]   Twitter is counting something called
[00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:21.320]   monthly daily active users.
[00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:23.160]   And this is-- not monthly.
[00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:23.920]   Sorry.
[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:26.640]   That would make no sense-- monthly daily active users.
[00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:27.640]   What is MDow's?
[00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:28.160]   Monotizable.
[00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:29.000]   Monotizable.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.720]   They're even better.
[00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:31.840]   Thank you for correcting that.
[00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:35.880]   So MDow's monetizable daily active users
[00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:39.840]   is a number that Twitter gives its advertisers
[00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:42.640]   so that when they buy ads, it's in effect saying, well,
[00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:46.640]   every day, this many people who could click on your ad
[00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:47.680]   are watching.
[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:51.320]   They also say-- very clearly, they said this to the SEC.
[00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:52.520]   They said it to the FTC.
[00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:54.560]   They say it to advertisers.
[00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:58.600]   This is an estimate because it's hard to tell who's real
[00:20:58.600 --> 00:20:59.920]   and who's not real.
[00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:03.960]   We estimate about 5% of that MDow number.
[00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:07.760]   Very important, not of the total, but of the MDow number
[00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:08.920]   could still be bots.
[00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:13.840]   We try to filter them out, but we maybe be off by 5%.
[00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:17.840]   They never say how many of all of Twitter is bots.
[00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:19.800]   The whole point of calculating MDow
[00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:22.200]   is to tell advertisers, this is
[00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:24.120]   how many people could click on your ad,
[00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:26.480]   and we might be off by 5%.
[00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:30.200]   So Elon is intentionally or unintentionally conflating
[00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:33.400]   bots on the total platform with this very important number
[00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:34.200]   that Twitter is using.
[00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:36.160]   It's the number they use to monetize.
[00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:38.760]   And Twitter's always said it exactly right.
[00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:43.440]   And in fact, the whistleblower, much, confirms it.
[00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:44.640]   I mean, that's exactly right.
[00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:48.640]   I mean, I think to say whether Elon is doing it intentionally
[00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:50.240]   and unintentionally--
[00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:50.960]   He would look.
[00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:51.760]   Is there that much question around?
[00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:54.120]   We don't know his intent, but it looks like he's
[00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:55.120]   trying to get out of the deal.
[00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:57.880]   He looks at whatever he can find to get out of the deal.
[00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:00.280]   But I think the more important point,
[00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:04.680]   rather than the spam and the bot thing is kind of a tangent,
[00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:09.280]   the question is, did everybody who is basically
[00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:13.600]   an engineer at Twitter have access to basically mess
[00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:17.320]   with the platform with no logs that describe who
[00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:18.760]   messed with the platform?
[00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:20.000]   I mean, that's bad.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.560]   If you've got to commit code, if you've
[00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:23.560]   got to mess with the platform, that's something
[00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:24.760]   that you should put your name to.
[00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:27.800]   And he is basically alleging that anybody--
[00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:29.760]   But half the engineering team could commit anything.
[00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:31.720]   You're having to put their name to it.
[00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:34.720]   Here's why this whole MDOW thing is relevant to that.
[00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:41.400]   Because much is misstating this in Elon's favor,
[00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:44.600]   showing a misunderstanding of what's going on, which then
[00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:48.800]   casts, in my opinion, to doubt the entire whistleblower account.
[00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:51.240]   If he doesn't understand this, we
[00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:53.600]   don't know how much of this is accurate, how much of this
[00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:56.320]   is he thought supporting Musk.
[00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:58.200]   It puts the whole thing in doubt.
[00:22:58.200 --> 00:22:59.920]   So I'm not saying it's not true.
[00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:01.280]   I'm not saying it's true.
[00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:04.720]   I'm saying what we have to do is wait for an investigation.
[00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:08.520]   The SEC and the FTC will investigate.
[00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:09.440]   And see what they come up with.
[00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:10.320]   That'll be pretty quick, right?
[00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:13.360]   That'll come on pretty quickly.
[00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:15.760]   And 10 years will know what happened.
[00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:17.800]   I looked at this from a different perspective, which
[00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:19.440]   was follow the money.
[00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:23.680]   And so much in the federal whistleblower policy--
[00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:24.680]   There's a reward.
[00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:27.840]   --monthly, $10 million is the reward.
[00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:30.400]   But if you look at the SEC filings
[00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:32.640]   on top executives at Twitter, they're
[00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:36.360]   getting huge amounts of their compensation in stock.
[00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:38.520]   So I don't know the exact amounts
[00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:41.080]   that he was compensated in stock or how much he currently
[00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:41.880]   holds.
[00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:44.120]   But you're thinking that he would sabotage
[00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:49.400]   his own net worth by undermining the platform.
[00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:52.400]   So both of those things could be true.
[00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:52.920]   And I don't know what's--
[00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:55.840]   So is he going to make more money from the reward
[00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:58.240]   than he would lose from the failing stock?
[00:23:58.240 --> 00:23:59.680]   We don't know that.
[00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:00.640]   Right.
[00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:03.600]   What we don't know is if Elon Musk made a call and said,
[00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:05.600]   hey, you know, it'd really be helpful.
[00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:07.800]   I mean, that's really a scurrilous--
[00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:08.800]   That's very conspiratorial.
[00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:10.760]   That's a scurrilous accusation.
[00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:13.920]   But I think my point is there's a lot we don't know.
[00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:16.320]   And I don't think you could just say,
[00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:17.280]   well, much isn't lying.
[00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:18.400]   This is true.
[00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:20.240]   If it is, it's horrific.
[00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:21.000]   It's bad.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.760]   But there is some areas in this, including the MDOW,
[00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:25.880]   where he doesn't understand what's going on.
[00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:27.640]   There's also this question of, well, it's that bad.
[00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:29.560]   Why didn't you fix it?
[00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:31.360]   I mean, that's something he could have fixed.
[00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:32.520]   He was in charge of security.
[00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:35.000]   He could say, no, from now on, we've got a log access.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:35.480]   Simply.
[00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:38.240]   Well, I think the thing that it really comes down to
[00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:39.680]   and the thing that it just highlights--
[00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:43.200]   I mean, in a sense, the sad thing about this
[00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:47.200]   isn't really news, which is Twitter leadership
[00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:49.840]   is just an absolute shoot show.
[00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:50.880]   It's terrible.
[00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:55.960]   Nobody can really take responsibility for anything.
[00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:57.960]   We are in a situation where the board is
[00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:01.920]   trying to force a sale of a company at a stock price that
[00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:06.080]   was 30% lower than it was nine months ago in order
[00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:09.680]   to get out of what seems like a grim situation.
[00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:12.920]   This is not a company that's got its head screwed on straight.
[00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:13.920]   No, that's so--
[00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:16.960]   But we've always, like you said, this is not news.
[00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:18.280]   I know it's been a mess.
[00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:22.040]   But it is sort of crazy that this--
[00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:25.000]   Twitter has almost become a utility for a sale
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   of the internet.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:26.640]   So then--
[00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:30.000]   And it's kind of mad that it's run so insanely.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.600]   This is the real question then for you all as the panel.
[00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:36.920]   And I'd love to know what you think Becky, and I'd love Will,
[00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:38.720]   and I'd love Rodger Wayon and this.
[00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:41.200]   How important is Twitter?
[00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:43.080]   So what if it's a shoot show?
[00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:46.320]   Right?
[00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:48.480]   Who cares if it's a shoot show?
[00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:50.880]   So I think the answer is it's really important
[00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:53.200]   to a certain segment of the population.
[00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:54.840]   Journalists.
[00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:57.760]   Yeah, we way overestimate how much of the population that
[00:25:57.760 --> 00:25:57.920]   is.
[00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:02.080]   It's like 100% of journalists are on Twitter.
[00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:07.200]   And so journalists think that 100% of the world is Twitter.
[00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:09.040]   And I say that as a former journalist.
[00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:13.040]   And I understand the bubble.
[00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:14.400]   How important is it to real life?
[00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:16.960]   I mean, what percentage of the US population is on Twitter?
[00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:19.360]   Like 7%, 9%, less than?
[00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:21.080]   Yeah, but think about it this way.
[00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:24.200]   A lot of people assert that Twitter is the public square,
[00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:25.600]   right, of the digital--
[00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:26.480]   Yeah, that's my question.
[00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:27.600]   Is it?
[00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:31.400]   I like the metaphor that it's more the coliseum.
[00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:32.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:34.800]   A lot of people-- and this is not my original idea.
[00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:36.440]   This is brilliant.
[00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:41.320]   But the idea is that there's so much viewership
[00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:44.600]   of the blood sport that's taking place on Twitter.
[00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:45.920]   And that is important.
[00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:48.120]   And it's a proxy for the public square.
[00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:50.320]   Now, that's just one thought.
[00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:52.720]   Another thing-- this is--
[00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:56.520]   this question really was in front of mine for me also, Leo.
[00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:58.320]   So I did a little research.
[00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:00.520]   And listen to this.
[00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:02.880]   The Senate Judiciary Committee's top Republican Chuck
[00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:05.280]   Grassley said that all of these complaints,
[00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:07.880]   the whistleblower complaint, raised serious national security
[00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:11.000]   concerns and privacy issues that need to be investigated.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.320]   And he said, take a tech platform that
[00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:15.240]   collects massive amounts of user data,
[00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:18.520]   combine it with what appears to be an incredibly weak security
[00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:21.440]   infrastructure, and infuse it with foreign state actors
[00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:25.080]   with an agenda, and you've got a recipe for disaster.
[00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:26.560]   I actually thought that was pretty intelligent.
[00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:30.600]   Except the foreign state actors aren't getting the data
[00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:31.760]   that Twitter collects.
[00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:33.760]   What data does Twitter collect, really?
[00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:36.320]   It doesn't collect the same quality of data
[00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:39.840]   that Google and Facebook collect incidentally.
[00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:41.320]   I mean, what information--
[00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:43.200]   You mean you go look at the trading topics
[00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:44.960]   to know that, right?
[00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:45.360]   Yeah.
[00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:47.040]   I mean, what information do you give Twitter?
[00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:48.320]   Not much.
[00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:50.160]   In fact, they did misuse the information.
[00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:51.120]   We know this.
[00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:54.760]   When you give them email and phone numbers for two factor,
[00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:58.240]   we found out-- and they've pleaded guilty to this--
[00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:02.080]   that they would use it for advertising.
[00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:03.240]   OK.
[00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:05.200]   But that's not a national security issue.
[00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:07.040]   Remember, the Republicans don't like Twitter
[00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:09.160]   because they banned Donald Trump.
[00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:11.520]   And so I think there's a certain amount of piling
[00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:16.040]   on from the Republicans because they just don't like Twitter.
[00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:20.160]   So let me ask you this, Becky.
[00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:23.400]   Do you think Twitter could be used by foreign adversaries
[00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:26.600]   as a potent propaganda tool?
[00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:27.040]   I don't know.
[00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:30.360]   I mean, I guess I would only just extrapolate in the thought
[00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:34.400]   experiment based on the complaint and the whistleblower
[00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:38.960]   complaint, which is what would be a scenario where it could
[00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:41.520]   have caused more destructive actions, say,
[00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:43.360]   during the January 6 insurrection?
[00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:45.120]   What if certain accounts were suppressed
[00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:47.400]   and others were promoted?
[00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:51.200]   Would that have really changed history?
[00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:51.800]   I'm not sure.
[00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:52.440]   I don't think so.
[00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:53.960]   I mean, maybe it was used to organize.
[00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:56.920]   But if it didn't work, they could have gone WhatsApp.
[00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:58.080]   They could have gone to Signal.
[00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:00.400]   They could have gone to any number of best platforms.
[00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:04.880]   True social apparently is a medical bankrupt, by the way.
[00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:05.600]   But that's another thing.
[00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:07.640]   But I think that doesn't matter entirely.
[00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:10.680]   You've hit the nail on the head with the Colosseum thing, right?
[00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:13.680]   It's about a group of people wanting
[00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:17.720]   a certain amount of spectacle and enjoying this spectacle.
[00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:21.320]   But I think the fact that we're even discussing this
[00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:22.720]   evening is OK.
[00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:26.520]   Look, we're going to discuss it because the quote comes
[00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:29.560]   to mind of, Leo, are you not entertained?
[00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:30.720]   Yes.
[00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:34.360]   Well, I have heard from many of our most avid fans
[00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:36.880]   that they are not entertained by discussions of Twitter.
[00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:40.600]   So I am taking a great risk doing this.
[00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:42.120]   But I think it's important.
[00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:42.800]   So my point--
[00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:43.440]   I have two minutes to nuggets.
[00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:47.360]   My point with Grassley is he's bringing in two separate things--
[00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:51.360]   the privacy violations and foreign actors.
[00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:52.880]   They're too completely separate.
[00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:54.720]   There's no intersection, even though he's
[00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:56.720]   acting as if there's an intersection.
[00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:59.480]   I think the private actors thing is reasonable.
[00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:00.640]   More nuggets for more nuggets.
[00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:02.560]   Two nuggets that I think are interesting.
[00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:05.800]   The attorney for Mudge is Deborah Katz.
[00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:07.560]   And I thought, gosh, I know that name.
[00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:08.720]   And I looked her up.
[00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:13.720]   She represented Christine Blasey Ford in the Kavanaugh hearings
[00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:18.400]   and the chief whistleblower in the Harvey Weinstein debacle.
[00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:21.960]   So she's an important whistleblower attorney.
[00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:22.840]   She's a heavy hitter.
[00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:25.760]   So these are not small actors here.
[00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:27.880]   So I thought that was super interesting.
[00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:29.400]   Can I ask a macro question?
[00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:31.480]   Rod Pyle, macro questioner.
[00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:33.080]   Rod finally speaks up.
[00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:34.160]   So I've missed--
[00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:36.680]   You're just wisely avoiding it because for the last month
[00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:37.760]   you've been in the Arctic.
[00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:39.200]   Well, no, I haven't gotten any news
[00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:40.400]   because I couldn't listen to you.
[00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:41.800]   It was horrible.
[00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:47.080]   And literally, the only comms we had were 144 character
[00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:49.160]   texts on our GPS units.
[00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:51.200]   But that brought me to thinking about Twitter
[00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:54.480]   while I was up there because it was a similar character count.
[00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:58.560]   And so stupid macro question, but has anybody
[00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:03.960]   figured out what his musk's game plan might have been,
[00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:07.280]   just stepping back to the beginning of this crazy story,
[00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:10.360]   to almost buy Twitter, as opposed to actually
[00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:11.640]   be serious about it?
[00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:14.000]   I mean, I know there was talk about, well, he was going to do this,
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.040]   and then do that, and drive the price down to get it for less,
[00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:16.800]   and all that.
[00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:22.400]   But this is a guy who love him or like him crazy or not,
[00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:24.360]   has been on this kind of crusade,
[00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:26.840]   somewhat cook-sotic in some cases,
[00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:29.160]   to build electric cars to save the environment,
[00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:32.320]   to build massive, ever-larger rockets.
[00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:36.200]   He tells us to set up a backup population on Mars,
[00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:38.920]   although I think most of us who don't get to go probably
[00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:40.200]   wouldn't be that supportive of that.
[00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:41.160]   But we like the idea.
[00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:46.320]   And in theory, for $44 billion, he
[00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:50.680]   could have condominiums on the rings of Saturn right now.
[00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:53.120]   So what is the point, if he's really doing this,
[00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:54.600]   is there some other agenda here?
[00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:57.560]   Does he really think that it is such a big chunk
[00:31:57.560 --> 00:31:59.040]   of the public conversation that he's
[00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:02.040]   going to use that to drive his other agenda?
[00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:02.880]   I'm confused.
[00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:05.280]   Can I give the conspiratorial answer
[00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:06.360]   from the other side of the poem?
[00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:07.400]   Oh, I love conspiracies.
[00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:09.560]   And we never flew to the moon, you're going to tell me.
[00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:11.360]   So the conspiracy that we have over here--
[00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:13.480]   There was a guy used to be on the show that said that,
[00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:16.120]   and we don't have that anymore.
[00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:17.000]   I'll ban him.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:17.760]   Go ahead.
[00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:23.040]   Is that Elon obviously has an enormous stake in Tesla,
[00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:25.920]   which is, to a greater or lesser degree,
[00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:28.960]   heavily dependent on government grants.
[00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:32.560]   And part of the inflation reduction
[00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:35.000]   act gives a lot of credit to automakers
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:36.080]   that make electric cars.
[00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:38.360]   It restores Tesla's credits, which he had lost.
[00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:38.840]   Yeah.
[00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:43.920]   He has enormous contracts with the space agency,
[00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:47.400]   and NASA, which are government bodies.
[00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:50.080]   And all of this is a very long play
[00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:54.400]   on the expectation that Donald Trump will win in 2024.
[00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:58.000]   And in order to restore access to Donald Trump's Twitter
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.960]   account in 2024, there might be a little quid pro quo to L.
[00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:02.960]   Do you-- wait a minute.
[00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:07.040]   People across the pond think that?
[00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:10.000]   I mean, when it comes to all the things we think about most
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.760]   things, is it crazy?
[00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:14.400]   Is it crazy to think that Elon would
[00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:16.480]   barter Donald Trump's Twitter account?
[00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:19.680]   I think there's a simpler Occam's razor here.
[00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:22.000]   I think there's a simpler explanation for all of this,
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.040]   that the Elon Musk who founded--
[00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:27.240]   didn't find-- bought Tesla and built it.
[00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:29.040]   Did he found SpaceX, or did he buy it?
[00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:31.400]   Yeah, I found it with a couple other engineers.
[00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:34.840]   And built it is not the Elon Musk of late
[00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:37.360]   that we've seen primarily on Twitter.
[00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:40.520]   His latest thing, by the way, is the biggest crisis coming
[00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:42.920]   to the world is underpopulation,
[00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:46.560]   which is why I have 10 children.
[00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:48.880]   He's off his rocker now.
[00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:50.960]   He's not the same guy.
[00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:52.480]   He's off his rocker.
[00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:56.640]   And he's also shoot-- he's a ready fire aim kind of guy
[00:33:56.640 --> 00:34:01.800]   who ready fired aim $44 billion to buy Twitter,
[00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:04.160]   and then realized, oh, that was a bad idea,
[00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:06.320]   and has been trying to get out of it ever since.
[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:07.280]   That's Occam's razor.
[00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:10.480]   I think ready fire aim was how we got his 10 kids, wasn't it?
[00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:12.680]   What do you think, Becky?
[00:34:12.680 --> 00:34:16.520]   Yeah, I mean, I think he shoots from the hip.
[00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:19.520]   And it's worked well for him for a long time.
[00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:23.440]   And this-- there's times when it doesn't work,
[00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:24.600]   and you want to back out.
[00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:29.200]   And he really got into it, and is now in a big legal bruja,
[00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:31.520]   which is going to take up a lot of his time and energy.
[00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:34.560]   And cost him money, because I don't think there's
[00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:36.480]   any way that Delaware Court doesn't say, well,
[00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:38.880]   you got to make Twitter at least a little bit whole.
[00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:40.840]   I don't think they're going to make them buy it.
[00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:42.840]   But I think that they're going to say more than a billion--
[00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:44.760]   the more than the billion dollar breakup fee,
[00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:46.880]   it's going to cost him several billions.
[00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:47.560]   And by the way--
[00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:50.320]   I also think the market changing in the middle of all this offer--
[00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:50.800]   Didn't help.
[00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:53.840]   I mean, didn't help, and might have given him cold feed
[00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:55.160]   if he was sort of on the edge.
[00:34:55.160 --> 00:34:55.880]   And so maybe--
[00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:58.280]   If you look at the amount of Tesla stocks that he's--
[00:34:58.280 --> 00:34:58.880]   He's had a soul.
[00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:01.600]   Yeah, the amount of Tesla stocks that he sold to try
[00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:02.600]   and make that happen, right?
[00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:04.680]   And saying, I'm not going to sell him more Tesla stock,
[00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:07.840]   and then two months later, more Tesla stock.
[00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:10.720]   Well, there is another conspiracy theory on that one.
[00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:13.040]   Tesla's just did a three-for-one stock swap.
[00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:17.680]   And the thinking was that he was going to sell this stock.
[00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:20.040]   There was a tax manipulation, essentially.
[00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:23.280]   And then buy it back at a lower cost after the split.
[00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:28.080]   So in fact, there's some people who even think
[00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:31.360]   that was the play all along.
[00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:33.840]   I'm trying to remember who it was--
[00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:37.000]   not Jim Kramer, another stock guru who says,
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   I don't know what this really was all about a Tesla stock,
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.760]   and nothing about Twitter, nothing to do with Twitter.
[00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:44.200]   So--
[00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:47.880]   I actually thought Elon looked really normal this week
[00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:54.160]   at the SpaceX T-Mobile event when he was talking about satellite
[00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:55.480]   coverage and how that's going to--
[00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:56.800]   Let's talk about this, because that's
[00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:59.600]   going to be a great story for the next segment,
[00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:02.880]   because it ties in with what Apple's about to do
[00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:05.680]   week from Wednesday.
[00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:07.240]   Are we done with this Twitter?
[00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:08.800]   Yes, we're so done.
[00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:09.920]   We're so done.
[00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:12.840]   I would say-- correct me if I'm wrong-- bottom line
[00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:17.080]   on this-- interesting, whistleblower, fascinating,
[00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:19.840]   going to have to withhold judgment until I see more evidence.
[00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:23.280]   The EU is also going to do an investigation.
[00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:28.040]   There's investigations galore being launched by this.
[00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:29.440]   I personally am going to wait and see.
[00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:32.520]   I'm not going to believe or disbelieve.
[00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:33.720]   I'm just going to wait and see.
[00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:35.120]   Does that seem reasonable?
[00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:38.200]   Yeah, there's lots of signals pointing in both directions,
[00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:43.360]   and I think it's fair to hold your judgment until time plays out.
[00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:47.200]   In about 2028.
[00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:47.760]   Alas.
[00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:50.080]   I think he just loves achieving in chaos.
[00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:51.760]   I think he loves attention.
[00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:54.680]   I think he's at this point in attention, Hor.
[00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:56.160]   Yeah, it's a very--
[00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:59.160]   I mean, anything around Elon is a very high signal to noise
[00:36:59.160 --> 00:36:59.880]   ratio, right?
[00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:03.600]   More very low signal to noise ratio.
[00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:04.240]   It's one of those.
[00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:05.240]   It's either high or low.
[00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:07.680]   Well, what's the right one?
[00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:10.480]   The signal high noise.
[00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:15.000]   Yeah, so that depends on your mess.
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   You got it.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.800]   People who know-- you started to say, right, people who know Elon,
[00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:21.080]   well, it seemed to feel that money really
[00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:24.720]   has been the sort of late arrival of concerns to him.
[00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:27.880]   And I mean, he was so close to totally winking out
[00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:29.880]   when SpaceX was first failing.
[00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:31.240]   Not the first time.
[00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:32.920]   He's done--
[00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:36.440]   He's thrown his entire fortune into Tesla,
[00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:38.600]   risking the loss of everything.
[00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:41.560]   And did it again with SpaceX at least two or three times.
[00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:44.920]   And if it wasn't for external investment, they'd be done.
[00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:48.040]   But-- and again, these are just people who know him well.
[00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:49.400]   I don't at all.
[00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:53.120]   But their feeling is that this concern about money
[00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:54.800]   has become kind of a late arrival.
[00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:56.720]   This emperor, Elon thing that we're
[00:37:56.720 --> 00:37:59.120]   beginning to see on Twitter is also
[00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:00.160]   a bit of a late arrival.
[00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:01.560]   And they're confused.
[00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:04.720]   So when I ask him what they feel, their feeling is he's still
[00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:05.920]   not that concerned about it.
[00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:07.920]   He's really just concerned about this achievement
[00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:10.960]   within chaos kind of lifestyle that he loves.
[00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:12.600]   He's done amazing things.
[00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:13.280]   The chopsticks--
[00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:14.360]   And he revolutionized the launch industry.
[00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:19.760]   The chopsticks thing that catches the SpaceX capsule
[00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:24.000]   as it's coming back, it catches it,
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.800]   then reposition it on top of the next rocket.
[00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:27.320]   Yeah.
[00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:28.120]   What?
[00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:30.400]   Who thought that was a good idea?
[00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:31.400]   But at work--
[00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:32.600]   He took on these major--
[00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:34.360]   sorry, I'm getting off the space angle again.
[00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:34.960]   I can't help it.
[00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:38.720]   But he took on these major prime contractors that NASA,
[00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:42.160]   and especially the Air Force, have been working with for decades.
[00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:43.960]   Well, that's what we're going to see tomorrow with Artemis,
[00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:47.040]   which is essentially a Boeing launch on a SpaceX launch.
[00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:49.480]   Much delayed, six years delayed.
[00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:51.480]   Well, it depends on how you slice that.
[00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:52.480]   You know, you start counting.
[00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:54.000]   You could say more like 20 years
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:55.560]   if you look back to constellation.
[00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:57.600]   But he took on all these contractors
[00:38:57.600 --> 00:38:59.120]   and said, I can do it better than you.
[00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:01.560]   And I can bring him rockets back and wash him off
[00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:03.200]   and empty the ashtrays and launch him again.
[00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:03.680]   And he did.
[00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:05.400]   Because it's just not that hard.
[00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:07.240]   So I talked a few years ago to Tori Bruno,
[00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:09.760]   who's the CEO of United Launch Alliance.
[00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:11.960]   And he said, yeah, he cleaned our clock.
[00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:14.720]   And we had to go out and figure out how to do this cheaper.
[00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:17.520]   And SpaceX now controls over half the world's launch industry.
[00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:19.760]   And that includes all this stuff China does.
[00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:20.880]   So amazing stuff.
[00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:22.200]   He's obviously a genius.
[00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:25.280]   But there's a little loose part rattling.
[00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:26.200]   I think--
[00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:29.640]   Honest, I've always thought this.
[00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:33.360]   If we'd had Twitter for 500 years, we would have known--
[00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:34.640]   they're all freaking nuts.
[00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:36.000]   Edison, nuts.
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:37.560]   Ford, nuts.
[00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:38.920]   These guys are all nuts.
[00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:41.360]   We just didn't know it because there was no Twitter.
[00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:42.320]   So thank God for your--
[00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:44.160]   Well, the spectrum hadn't been defined yet.
[00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:44.680]   Yeah.
[00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:46.200]   Are they-- is it a spectrum issue?
[00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:46.520]   I don't know.
[00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:47.200]   What do you want?
[00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:47.760]   He says so.
[00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:49.120]   And certainly for some of the other--
[00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:49.120]   You know what?
[00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:50.720]   That's convenient for Elon.
[00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:51.720]   I don't--
[00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:52.200]   Yeah.
[00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:53.840]   But if you've ever seen him in person,
[00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:54.800]   it wouldn't shock me.
[00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:56.640]   He claims he's on the artistic spectrum.
[00:39:56.640 --> 00:40:00.320]   Yeah, and he does have those kind of little mental pops
[00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:01.680]   where it does seem like it.
[00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:05.000]   But like I said, I don't know him well, so I can't say.
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:08.960]   All the genius is a crazy, le port, nuts.
[00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:10.040]   You put me in that--
[00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:10.880]   All the nuts.
[00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:14.160]   He's not ADD guy or you wouldn't be here.
[00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:16.000]   I'm definitely ADD.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.920]   But when I coach and when I coach kids,
[00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:21.240]   I often have kids who I look at them
[00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:24.440]   and I try and assess who they are and what they're about.
[00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:26.120]   And then I imagine their future.
[00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:30.160]   And some kids, they're either jail or Olympics.
[00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:32.080]   And that's kind of--
[00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:33.200]   And the same kid, though.
[00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:34.360]   That's the point, right?
[00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:34.880]   Same kid.
[00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:36.400]   You don't know if that kid is going to jail
[00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:37.240]   or going to the Olympics.
[00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:38.080]   You have no idea.
[00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:38.800]   That's a great episode.
[00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:40.960]   That's a great episode.
[00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:43.240]   Jailer Olympics, episode 890.
[00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:44.920]   Yeah.
[00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:45.560]   So that's Elon.
[00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:46.520]   You know what?
[00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:49.320]   That's the definition of genius, maybe.
[00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:51.200]   Jailer Olympics, right?
[00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:52.280]   No, really, seriously.
[00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:53.080]   That's the definition.
[00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:54.000]   Or Nobel Prize.
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:55.000]   I mean, let's--
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:00.600]   The geniuses of the world are a different species.
[00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:01.680]   I'm not a--
[00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:04.520]   And so I'm just going to put along.
[00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:10.800]   But the genius is to sort of that level,
[00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:13.000]   there is this great risk that you will go the other way.
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:16.600]   And I think that that's actually the most astute thing
[00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:18.000]   we've said today, Becky.
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:21.880]   Well, it's the Hemingway, Oscar Wilde,
[00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:23.160]   Hunter S. Thompson model, right?
[00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:24.160]   You can go over--
[00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:25.160]   Look at Steve Jobs.
[00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:26.000]   You have to be a genius.
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:27.840]   You can go on and on and on.
[00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:29.280]   Look at it till of the hunt.
[00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:30.240]   Nice guy.
[00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:32.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:34.560]   But you really wouldn't want him as a neighbor.
[00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:35.360]   He was a nice guy.
[00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:36.480]   He was a nice guy.
[00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:37.960]   He was a nice guy.
[00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:39.100]   Great cook.
[00:41:39.100 --> 00:41:39.800]   He was fun to be with.
[00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:41.080]   What are we eating at that barbecue?
[00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:42.720]   But you wouldn't want to move next door.
[00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:44.160]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:47.840]   Well, and I say just in following up with what you're
[00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:50.280]   talking about, I worked at Caltech for a year,
[00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:52.560]   so I'd go down to the cafeteria for lunch every day.
[00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:55.360]   And you're surrounded by these Nobel Prize winning
[00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:58.680]   multi-doctorate brilliant people from all over the country.
[00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:02.240]   But the cafeteria is the most dysfunctional logistics
[00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:05.040]   nightmare you've ever seen because people walk--
[00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:08.440]   literally walk into each other, lunches flying everywhere.
[00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:11.160]   I mean, I would try and walk with my tray with a sandwich.
[00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:13.440]   And you'd sort of carve this path between people
[00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:15.200]   that are staring over your right shoulder,
[00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:17.080]   never in your eye, over your right shoulder,
[00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:20.080]   and walking right towards you like you can't be there.
[00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:22.640]   You're not allowed in that same dimension they're in or something.
[00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:23.680]   It wasn't arrogance.
[00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:24.920]   It was just personality strength.
[00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:26.360]   You have to be a rule breaker if you're
[00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:28.120]   going to achieve to that.
[00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:30.720]   I mean, clearly, these are rules they are breaking.
[00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:31.760]   This is just their condition.
[00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:33.280]   This is just their condition.
[00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:33.760]   They were on--
[00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:36.120]   And it was really cool to be around those people.
[00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:39.720]   But the ATH spectrum, the Attila the Hunspect.
[00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:41.720]   Yeah, I think we've got a new one.
[00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:42.440]   We've got a new one.
[00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:44.280]   All right, I can be doing a long pork for lunch.
[00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:44.800]   OK.
[00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:46.960]   Ooh.
[00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:48.560]   Nice guy, but you wouldn't want to go to the bar--
[00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:49.800]   Wouldn't want to go to the barbe.
[00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:51.400]   I know what you're saying.
[00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:52.400]   We do have to take a break.
[00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:53.120]   We will come back.
[00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:55.840]   And then we will talk about whatever that thing was about five
[00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:57.240]   minutes ago you said we should talk about.
[00:42:57.240 --> 00:42:58.440]   But we're going to get to that.
[00:42:58.440 --> 00:42:59.080]   You bet.
[00:42:59.080 --> 00:42:59.840]   As soon as somebody remembers--
[00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:00.720]   Team level in space.
[00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:01.200]   Thank you.
[00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:01.720]   Thank you.
[00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:02.200]   Thank you.
[00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:02.840]   I'm here for you.
[00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:03.840]   I'm so you a producer.
[00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:06.560]   There's still my producer.
[00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:09.560]   She-- remember, move your mouth.
[00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:10.560]   Remember that?
[00:43:10.560 --> 00:43:11.520]   Yes.
[00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:12.520]   We're doing call for help.
[00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:13.640]   I've told this so many times.
[00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:15.120]   But if so, I apologize if you've heard it.
[00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:15.960]   We're doing call for help.
[00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:18.400]   I have Becky in my ear, which is the best thing in the world
[00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:19.760]   is to have Becky poorly.
[00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:20.720]   In the control room.
[00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:21.720]   And she's the producer.
[00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:22.480]   She's the line producer.
[00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:23.880]   She's in your ear.
[00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:27.480]   And she says, move your mouth.
[00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:30.120]   And I thought-- she said move your mouth.
[00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:33.280]   She meant my mouse pointer was on something on the screen.
[00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:34.600]   She meant move your mouse.
[00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:37.040]   But I, like an idiot, start going like this.
[00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:44.680]   That was the control and how wonderfully
[00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:45.680]   collaborative it is.
[00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:47.120]   Whatever you say, Becky.
[00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:48.720]   I'm an audio medium.
[00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:52.120]   Whatever you say.
[00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:53.360]   Mouse, mouse.
[00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:55.640]   There's a fine line between mouse and mouse.
[00:43:55.640 --> 00:43:57.560]   I'm just saying, like there is between--
[00:43:57.560 --> 00:43:58.640]   you could get you a real--
[00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:00.480]   the Olympics and jail.
[00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:03.840]   Our show today brought to you by Policy Genius.
[00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:05.560]   Now, this is true genius here.
[00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:08.720]   We pay hundreds of dollars a year for insurance to protect
[00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:11.560]   our homes, our cars, our phones.
[00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:14.120]   What are you doing to protect your family?
[00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:15.120]   My phone's insured.
[00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:15.640]   My family?
[00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:17.280]   Wait a minute, what?
[00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:23.200]   Mortgage payments, schools, colleges.
[00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:25.560]   Those kind of debts don't disappear if something happens
[00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:26.720]   to you.
[00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:29.880]   A life insurance policy is the best way, the only way
[00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:30.760]   to protect your loved ones.
[00:44:30.760 --> 00:44:36.040]   With a financial cushion they can use to cover those costs.
[00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:38.000]   And I know no one wants to think about the worst case
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:40.440]   scenario, but let me tell you, it's important for peace of mind.
[00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:42.800]   It's the first thing I did when the kids were born.
[00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:43.720]   I said, you know what?
[00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:44.680]   Responsible.
[00:44:44.680 --> 00:44:48.680]   I have to get life insurance.
[00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:51.080]   And I still have it, which probably could stop now.
[00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:54.160]   But I think it was a very important thing to do.
[00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:56.160]   We also have insurance on me for the company.
[00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:59.760]   We have what they call key man insurance.
[00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:03.400]   Having life insurance through your job, which I always had,
[00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:07.920]   probably not enough, maybe enough to buy a nice urn.
[00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:08.680]   But that's about it.
[00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:11.000]   Most people need about 10 times more coverage
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:15.120]   than their job provides to properly provide for your families.
[00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:17.680]   Now, I got to tell you, life insurance gets more expensive
[00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:18.120]   as you age.
[00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:20.320]   I'm glad I got it in my 30s.
[00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:23.360]   You always want to get the policy sooner than later.
[00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:24.960]   Here's the way to do it.
[00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:27.720]   I wish this had been around when I was getting my policy.
[00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:29.520]   Policy genius.
[00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:30.800]   It's not an insurer.
[00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:32.480]   It's an insurance marketplace.
[00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:33.680]   So that's what you want.
[00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:36.760]   You want to make it easy to compare quotes from top companies,
[00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:39.480]   but the big ones, AIG, Prudential.
[00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:41.200]   But you want to do it in one place
[00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:43.560]   to find the lowest price in life insurance.
[00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:45.280]   By comparing quotes with policy genius,
[00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:48.240]   you can say 50% or more on life insurance.
[00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:50.840]   The market is very inefficient.
[00:45:50.840 --> 00:45:53.680]   And so the cost of life insurance for you
[00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:58.720]   could vary 50% even more.
[00:45:58.720 --> 00:46:02.240]   You can go to policy genius, get a policy for say,
[00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:03.920]   let's say, half a million dollars in coverage.
[00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:05.520]   That's probably what you'd want to start with,
[00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:06.840]   as little as $17 a month.
[00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:08.760]   Isn't it your family worth that?
[00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:12.960]   Click the link on the show page or go to policygenius.com/twit.
[00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:15.040]   You can get personalized quotes in minutes, no obligation,
[00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:16.200]   no cost.
[00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:19.440]   Find the right policy for your needs.
[00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:22.240]   In order to advise you on this and help you with this,
[00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:25.320]   the people of policy genius have to be licensed agents.
[00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:28.080]   That doesn't mean they're selling you their life insurance,
[00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:32.800]   but they have to be licensed agents to advise you.
[00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:34.080]   And they're working for--
[00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:35.280]   I want to make this really clear.
[00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:36.480]   They're working for you.
[00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:38.360]   They are not employees of insurance companies.
[00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:41.040]   They're on hand for the whole process.
[00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:42.320]   So you have somebody trusted.
[00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:44.040]   You can ask, well, what's this mean?
[00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:45.440]   What should I do?
[00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:47.680]   They want you to understand your options
[00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:49.480]   so you can make decisions with confidence.
[00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:51.640]   And they're not paid by the insurance companies.
[00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:54.480]   Policy genius does not add on extra fees.
[00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:56.240]   They don't sell your info to third parties.
[00:46:56.240 --> 00:46:58.720]   I know we're all very sensitive about that these days.
[00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:02.080]   Just check Google or Trust Pilot and look at the reviews.
[00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:03.760]   Thousands of five-star reviews.
[00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:04.480]   People use it.
[00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:06.440]   They love it.
[00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:08.960]   You can get coverage in as little as a week.
[00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:13.120]   If you want, you can avoid unnecessary medical exams.
[00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:14.200]   It depends.
[00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:15.560]   But you can go there and say, that's
[00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:16.960]   one of the things I'm looking for.
[00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:20.560]   Since 2014, policy genius has helped get this.
[00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:24.160]   Over 30 million people shop for insurance.
[00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:27.200]   They've placed $150 billion in coverage
[00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:29.160]   of the biggest insurance companies,
[00:47:29.160 --> 00:47:30.920]   the best insurance companies.
[00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:33.400]   They do, of course, have home, auto, disability, runners.
[00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:34.400]   They have all the insurance.

[00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:42.320]   But I wanted to really emphasize the life insurance,
[00:47:42.320 --> 00:47:44.880]   because that's something I think a lot of people forget about.
[00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:47.200]   Go to policygenius.com/twit.

[00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:53.720]   We appreciate it.
[00:47:53.720 --> 00:47:54.720]   And you support the show.
[00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:56.040]   And I always say this.
[00:47:56.040 --> 00:47:58.400]   But please take it seriously.
[00:47:58.400 --> 00:47:59.840]   When you go to that special address,
[00:47:59.840 --> 00:48:02.480]   because they're looking for that to see if you saw it here.
[00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:08.960]   policygenius.com/twit.
[00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:10.640]   I'm going to get to your story, but I'm
[00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:14.400]   going to do it in a circuitous fashion, Becky Worley.
[00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:20.360]   Because the Apple event, we've got the invitation.
[00:48:20.360 --> 00:48:21.760]   The invitations went out.
[00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:22.960]   Are you going to go, Becky?
[00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:24.240]   Do you get to go to--
[00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:24.920]   I'm not sure.
[00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:30.120]   I got the invitation to stream, but I may or may not--
[00:48:30.120 --> 00:48:32.280]   I think we get one invitation for ABC.
[00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:35.280]   So they're talking about sending me--
[00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:36.080]   I'm not sure.
[00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:38.160]   Everybody in Northern California gets one invitation,
[00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:39.000]   and I'm not on that list.
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:40.000]   No.
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:41.920]   No, well, you and I were both banned.
[00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:42.720]   I'm just happy to be--
[00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:43.640]   Were you banned?
[00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:46.160]   Yes, because of twin.
[00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:48.920]   Oh, this is when you accosted Steve Jobs?
[00:48:48.920 --> 00:48:50.440]   He came to me.
[00:48:50.440 --> 00:48:50.960]   OK.
[00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:51.600]   In record.
[00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:53.000]   Tell us what happens.
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:56.320]   I was live streaming to you from the event,
[00:48:56.320 --> 00:48:58.360]   from the magic room, where you get to touch all the goodies.
[00:48:58.360 --> 00:48:59.520]   The demo room, yes.
[00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:00.120]   Yeah.
[00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:02.640]   And I was just showing everything that was there,
[00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:04.000]   and I was live streaming.
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:06.600]   And then I had one of those headsets on it.
[00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:10.040]   Let's run the tape.
[00:49:10.040 --> 00:49:10.720]   Here we go.
[00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:11.480]   Turn up my sound.
[00:49:11.480 --> 00:49:12.600]   Do you have my sound?
[00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:13.040]   All right.
[00:49:13.040 --> 00:49:14.880]   I don't know why I'm plugging into the phone.
[00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:16.760]   I guess that's the only way I could--
[00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:18.080]   Where's--
[00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:22.120]   This is from my phone, and I'm just looking at everything.
[00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:26.400]   And then Steve walked over, and he walked up to me and said,
[00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:27.920]   what are you doing?
[00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:31.120]   And I said, well, I'm live streaming,
[00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:33.920]   and we're looking at all the great gadgets.
[00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:35.920]   And then I asked him a question that he didn't like.
[00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:38.600]   And then his lady handler got real--
[00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:40.560]   that's her in the '80s.
[00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:42.720]   She got real unhappy with me.
[00:49:42.720 --> 00:49:44.000]   Push you away.
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:46.160]   You asked him, when are you going to open FaceTime?
[00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:48.720]   You promised FaceTime would be open source, right?
[00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:49.480]   Yep.
[00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:49.880]   Yeah.
[00:49:49.880 --> 00:49:51.040]   Why am I not getting sound?
[00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:54.720]   Are you doing-- what's going on?
[00:49:54.720 --> 00:49:57.400]   It's on my end, he says.
[00:49:57.400 --> 00:49:57.900]   Yeah.
[00:49:57.900 --> 00:49:58.800]   Don't think it's on my end.
[00:49:58.800 --> 00:49:59.440]   Would you please check?
[00:49:59.440 --> 00:50:01.080]   He didn't like that question very much.
[00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:02.080]   And Katie--
[00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:03.680]   He's looking at his face.
[00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:06.080]   Oh, he's grumpy.
[00:50:06.080 --> 00:50:07.440]   Video conferencing?
[00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:07.800]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:08.520]   Let me go back.
[00:50:08.520 --> 00:50:09.520]   Go back.
[00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:10.020]   OK.
[00:50:10.020 --> 00:50:11.400]   I magically fixed the sound.
[00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:13.320]   Fits in the bag, and you take it up with the everywhere.
[00:50:13.320 --> 00:50:19.760]   OK, here's Becky, a costing the greatest man who ever lived.
[00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:21.120]   You like it a lot?
[00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:23.720]   Fits in the bag, and you take it up with the everywhere?
[00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:24.720]   You don't even need a bag.
[00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:27.320]   2.3.
[00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:29.320]   Back in Badline Palace.
[00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:31.040]   Can I ask you one other question?
[00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:33.720]   Does the fact that we now have FaceTime just on the Mac
[00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:38.200]   mean we won't see APIs for other video conferencing?
[00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:39.640]   We didn't say any such thing.
[00:50:39.640 --> 00:50:40.360]   OK, just share it.
[00:50:40.360 --> 00:50:42.120]   We didn't say any such thing.
[00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:42.720]   Yeah, he did.
[00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:43.120]   There you go.
[00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:43.640]   No, he did.
[00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:46.240]   It's our first on the Twitter action.
[00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:49.760]   And so you haven't been invited back since then, huh?
[00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:50.600]   A couple of years.
[00:50:50.600 --> 00:50:51.440]   Once they kind of--
[00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:51.800]   Yeah, they got them.
[00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:52.920]   Once Katie left.
[00:50:52.920 --> 00:50:53.760]   Once Katie left.
[00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:55.840]   If Katie caught never at any point, say, do you know Leo
[00:50:55.840 --> 00:50:56.720]   report?
[00:50:56.720 --> 00:50:57.360]   No.
[00:50:57.360 --> 00:50:57.840]   OK.
[00:50:57.840 --> 00:50:58.360]   No.
[00:50:58.360 --> 00:50:58.840]   OK.
[00:50:58.840 --> 00:50:59.360]   Just check.
[00:50:59.360 --> 00:50:59.880]   I didn't sort of love it.
[00:50:59.880 --> 00:51:01.200]   I didn't write you out.
[00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:03.160]   I'm just saying.
[00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:06.760]   I love just the mild casual sexism of like,
[00:51:06.760 --> 00:51:07.760]   can you put this in a bag?
[00:51:07.760 --> 00:51:08.560]   It's like, no, no, no.
[00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:09.760]   You don't even need a bag.
[00:51:09.760 --> 00:51:10.840]   You can put it in your pocket.
[00:51:10.840 --> 00:51:12.920]   It's like, the only dresses have pockets.
[00:51:12.920 --> 00:51:13.840]   Come on, man.
[00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:15.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:19.120]   This is the major complaint of all the women in my life.
[00:51:19.120 --> 00:51:21.080]   None of my dresses have pockets to be doing.
[00:51:21.080 --> 00:51:22.560]   A purse, of course.
[00:51:22.560 --> 00:51:24.160]   I think in hindsight, I like the fact
[00:51:24.160 --> 00:51:27.280]   that we were talking about, like, oh, it's so light and casual.
[00:51:27.280 --> 00:51:28.160]   Can you put it in the pocket?
[00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:29.440]   Hey, are those APIs coming out?
[00:51:29.440 --> 00:51:30.240]   Yeah, we're about FaceTime.
[00:51:30.240 --> 00:51:30.720]   All of us are--
[00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:32.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:51:32.280 --> 00:51:34.920]   You, that you sand-- you're a sandbagger.
[00:51:34.920 --> 00:51:36.640]   You are so good.
[00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:38.600]   You are so good.
[00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:41.120]   Thank you for doing that.
[00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:43.040]   I have such respect for you, Becky.
[00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:43.480]   That was--
[00:51:43.480 --> 00:51:43.800]   Oh, god.
[00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:45.040]   Well, that was a debacle.
[00:51:45.040 --> 00:51:45.320]   It was--
[00:51:45.320 --> 00:51:47.760]   Do you know what's amazing about that clip is, man,
[00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:49.440]   that is an old-ass iPhone.
[00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:49.960]   Yeah.
[00:51:49.960 --> 00:51:50.460]   Oh, yeah.
[00:51:50.460 --> 00:51:51.480]   I don't know why.
[00:51:51.480 --> 00:51:53.680]   I don't know why we're playing it off an iPhone.
[00:51:53.680 --> 00:51:55.160]   I don't know what was going on there.
[00:51:55.160 --> 00:51:57.080]   But anyway--
[00:51:57.080 --> 00:51:59.480]   But the new Apple event is going out.
[00:51:59.480 --> 00:52:00.920]   It's happening September the 7th.
[00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:04.560]   And the invite has this.
[00:52:04.560 --> 00:52:08.040]   The Alka Seltzer Apple, I call it.
[00:52:08.040 --> 00:52:10.040]   Plop, plop, fizz, fizz.
[00:52:10.040 --> 00:52:11.880]   Oh, what an iPhone it is.
[00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:16.040]   The tag is far out, which means me
[00:52:16.040 --> 00:52:17.840]   think this is supposed to be space.
[00:52:17.840 --> 00:52:19.320]   These are galaxies, right?
[00:52:19.320 --> 00:52:19.800]   This is--
[00:52:19.800 --> 00:52:21.720]   The Apple looks like stars in a galaxy.
[00:52:21.720 --> 00:52:22.800]   Yeah.
[00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:25.840]   So that makes me think about the rumors from a couple of years
[00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:30.000]   ago that the iPhone would have satellite connectivity, which
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:33.600]   then leads me to the story you were referring to,
[00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:38.880]   because weirdly, just this week, T-Mobile and SpaceX
[00:52:38.880 --> 00:52:42.120]   announced there would be satellite connectivity
[00:52:42.120 --> 00:52:47.160]   for T-Mobile subscribers coming next year.
[00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:48.000]   Hmm.
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:49.720]   Through what?
[00:52:49.720 --> 00:52:50.760]   What system?
[00:52:50.760 --> 00:52:52.440]   Well, that's an interesting question.
[00:52:52.440 --> 00:52:53.120]   Starlink with the--
[00:52:53.120 --> 00:52:53.960]   Starlink.
[00:52:53.960 --> 00:52:55.200]   Starlink.
[00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:58.880]   Now, I don't understand--
[00:52:58.880 --> 00:53:02.920]   they say you don't need anything special in your phone.
[00:53:02.920 --> 00:53:07.440]   They said a piece of T-Mobile's mid-band 2 and 1/2 gigahertz
[00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:12.400]   spectrum and a clear view of the sky is all you need,
[00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:14.840]   and that it will use the existing hardware that's
[00:53:14.840 --> 00:53:16.280]   already in your phone.
[00:53:16.280 --> 00:53:16.880]   Well, a radio--
[00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:18.480]   Because not 2 and 1/2 gigahertz spectrum
[00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:21.320]   has been just kicking around like ages.
[00:53:21.320 --> 00:53:23.920]   That was the slightly lame spectrum
[00:53:23.920 --> 00:53:28.000]   that people had to give up for 5G.
[00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:28.840]   Confused.
[00:53:28.840 --> 00:53:31.880]   They said you'll be able to text, send images,
[00:53:31.880 --> 00:53:34.160]   and if there aren't that many people in your area,
[00:53:34.160 --> 00:53:36.800]   you'll possibly be able to do video,
[00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:40.600]   and specifically said, works with existing cell phones.
[00:53:40.600 --> 00:53:42.880]   Yeah.
[00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:50.000]   It's-- I'm gathering, and certainly the Apple solution
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:52.440]   is intended for areas where there's no coverage,
[00:53:52.440 --> 00:53:54.640]   but you need-- it uses an emergency.
[00:53:54.640 --> 00:53:57.440]   It's like a spot phone, right?
[00:53:57.440 --> 00:53:59.840]   But that didn't sound like what T-Mobile--
[00:53:59.840 --> 00:54:03.560]   No, the Apple one was exclusively an SOS communication
[00:54:03.560 --> 00:54:04.400]   was the rumor.
[00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:07.480]   But the T-Mobile one is they said it'll
[00:54:07.480 --> 00:54:11.520]   be free for premium or mid-range accounts,
[00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:14.680]   low-cost accounts probably won't have it.
[00:54:14.680 --> 00:54:17.200]   And Musk said it's meant to provide basic coverage
[00:54:17.200 --> 00:54:20.600]   to areas that are completely dead.
[00:54:20.600 --> 00:54:21.760]   Hawaii, Alaska--
[00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:23.920]   This is one of the ocean parts.
[00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:24.680]   Ocean parts.
[00:54:24.680 --> 00:54:27.320]   This is one of those things where it's like--
[00:54:27.320 --> 00:54:33.960]   it feels like-- I don't want to say it's almost too localized
[00:54:33.960 --> 00:54:37.960]   to be an Apple event, but it's like--
[00:54:37.960 --> 00:54:41.200]   Europe doesn't have that problem, right?
[00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:43.320]   There aren't places in Europe really where you can go,
[00:54:43.320 --> 00:54:45.280]   where you can't get good cell phone coverage.
[00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:45.720]   Oh, come on.
[00:54:45.720 --> 00:54:47.280]   There are places in Transylvania
[00:54:47.280 --> 00:54:50.360]   where you cannot get cell coverage.
[00:54:50.360 --> 00:54:52.840]   It feels like a very American thing.
[00:54:52.840 --> 00:54:55.000]   I have an alternative theory.
[00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:55.840]   This is-- wait, this is--
[00:54:55.840 --> 00:54:56.720]   I'm going to bruise to me.
[00:54:56.720 --> 00:54:58.680]   I did not realize that only in America
[00:54:58.680 --> 00:55:00.880]   you lose cell phone coverage.
[00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:01.880]   Yeah.
[00:55:01.880 --> 00:55:03.840]   Anywhere in England, you're going to get decent 4G.
[00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:05.280]   Interesting.
[00:55:05.280 --> 00:55:07.760]   You know, that's what happens when you get Brexit.
[00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:09.200]   You know, you do.
[00:55:09.200 --> 00:55:12.240]   Brexit happens and you get the amazing coverage.
[00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:12.760]   All right.
[00:55:12.760 --> 00:55:13.760]   OK.
[00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:14.760]   OK.
[00:55:14.760 --> 00:55:20.080]   What about if it's a camera that has like a space mode?
[00:55:20.080 --> 00:55:22.080]   Because everyone wants to take proper photos of space.
[00:55:22.080 --> 00:55:23.400]   Oh, this is you talking about the Apple?
[00:55:23.400 --> 00:55:24.760]   You never get good ones.
[00:55:24.760 --> 00:55:26.400]   Yeah, that was the other speculation
[00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:30.720]   is that these are astrophotography.
[00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:31.400]   That was ours.
[00:55:31.400 --> 00:55:32.120]   Might first hit on it.
[00:55:32.120 --> 00:55:33.160]   That'd be cool, right?
[00:55:33.160 --> 00:55:34.960]   Because it's something you might get off the web
[00:55:34.960 --> 00:55:38.360]   and that you could then make the illusion too well.
[00:55:38.360 --> 00:55:40.240]   And they're selling all these great-- if you look at it,
[00:55:40.240 --> 00:55:43.360]   Celesteron now, they're really answering on the iPhone.
[00:55:43.360 --> 00:55:45.720]   This is my Pixel 6, which has excellent astrophotography.
[00:55:45.720 --> 00:55:46.840]   Yeah, there's a lot of them in the first.
[00:55:46.840 --> 00:55:48.200]   Came out a year ago.
[00:55:48.200 --> 00:55:50.040]   They've sold seven of those since I came out.
[00:55:50.040 --> 00:55:50.800]   Yeah, but I'm one of them.
[00:55:50.800 --> 00:55:51.800]   So, there we go.
[00:55:51.800 --> 00:55:53.200]   So, you know, I'm going to--
[00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:55.480]   No, but they're really pushing the iPhone over.
[00:55:55.480 --> 00:55:59.840]   And now for the first time, astrophotography on a phone.
[00:55:59.840 --> 00:56:02.240]   Yeah, because those seven people that bought that phone
[00:56:02.240 --> 00:56:02.840]   don't care.
[00:56:02.840 --> 00:56:05.120]   And it's giving them to bring space photography
[00:56:05.120 --> 00:56:06.720]   to the mainstream.
[00:56:06.720 --> 00:56:07.160]   OK.
[00:56:07.160 --> 00:56:09.200]   We're going to make space photography accessible to people
[00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:10.400]   for the first time.
[00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:12.320]   You can come up with all sorts of Apple blurb.
[00:56:12.320 --> 00:56:15.800]   It'll be called, you know, face space.
[00:56:15.800 --> 00:56:16.720]   Face space.
[00:56:16.720 --> 00:56:17.160]   It's an Apple app.
[00:56:17.160 --> 00:56:19.760]   And there'll be an open API for everyone else.
[00:56:19.760 --> 00:56:20.560]   Thank God.
[00:56:20.560 --> 00:56:25.960]   So, is that the panels, you know, or just sensible?
[00:56:25.960 --> 00:56:27.800]   Is this-- or just because it's--
[00:56:27.800 --> 00:56:28.440]   Well, I often--
[00:56:28.440 --> 00:56:29.360]   --the web decade now.
[00:56:29.360 --> 00:56:31.440]   On Mac, break weekly, we often say,
[00:56:31.440 --> 00:56:34.360]   the designers at Apple are just laughing their ass off
[00:56:34.360 --> 00:56:37.360]   when they see all the speculation from media.
[00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:39.680]   Well, this must mean satellite phones.
[00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:42.120]   No, no, it's just a good picture.
[00:56:42.120 --> 00:56:43.720]   Maybe it's just a tie into Artemis.
[00:56:43.720 --> 00:56:45.640]   Maybe the timing's close to the launch.
[00:56:45.640 --> 00:56:46.240]   Who knows?
[00:56:46.240 --> 00:56:48.600]   Yeah, or JWST.
[00:56:48.600 --> 00:56:50.120]   It just looks like Moon dust.
[00:56:50.120 --> 00:56:51.840]   That's kind of weird looking, isn't it?
[00:56:51.840 --> 00:56:53.640]   OK, but it's gruffy if it's supposed to be Artemis.
[00:56:53.640 --> 00:56:55.480]   But I do buy the web thing, maybe.
[00:56:55.480 --> 00:56:56.240]   I'm looking at it.
[00:56:56.240 --> 00:56:58.840]   And it does look a little bit like James Webb Galaxy.
[00:56:58.840 --> 00:57:01.320]   See, there's some on the side there.
[00:57:01.320 --> 00:57:02.560]   There's a tie into Diamond.
[00:57:02.560 --> 00:57:04.000]   You know, Cat Eye.
[00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:05.960]   But then what's inside?
[00:57:05.960 --> 00:57:06.480]   Nothing.
[00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:07.960]   That's gravitational lensing.
[00:57:07.960 --> 00:57:08.640]   And that's the power of--
[00:57:08.640 --> 00:57:10.320]   Oh!
[00:57:10.320 --> 00:57:14.680]   Are they going to use gravitational lensing for the web?
[00:57:14.680 --> 00:57:15.880]   They did for that first picture.
[00:57:15.880 --> 00:57:17.000]   So they use it for the web.
[00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:17.480]   I know.
[00:57:17.480 --> 00:57:18.480]   But I mean, with your--
[00:57:18.480 --> 00:57:19.280]   Can you do that with your--
[00:57:19.280 --> 00:57:19.840]   Yeah, I can.
[00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:21.080]   --crummy little home telescope.
[00:57:21.080 --> 00:57:21.760]   That I doubt.
[00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:26.800]   But OK, so you don't think this is the Alka seltzer Apple.
[00:57:26.800 --> 00:57:27.880]   Because it could look like that.
[00:57:27.880 --> 00:57:29.000]   I mean, I could be that too.
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:32.240]   Well, after paying $800 for a new lid for this computer
[00:57:32.240 --> 00:57:34.640]   a month after it went out of warranty, Alka seltzer Apple
[00:57:34.640 --> 00:57:35.480]   was inappropriate.
[00:57:35.480 --> 00:57:37.760]   So when you were up in the Arctic Circle--
[00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:38.560]   Yes, sir.
[00:57:38.560 --> 00:57:40.800]   --you had no phone service.
[00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:42.960]   You had to use satellite.
[00:57:42.960 --> 00:57:45.360]   Yeah, we had to actually use our GPS units.
[00:57:45.360 --> 00:57:45.880]   And the new--
[00:57:45.880 --> 00:57:47.560]   And they had tech experiments, though.
[00:57:47.560 --> 00:57:49.760]   But it's alphanumeric.
[00:57:49.760 --> 00:57:52.200]   So it was like a trip back to 1991.
[00:57:52.200 --> 00:57:53.120]   So it was going--
[00:57:53.120 --> 00:57:54.160]   You mean it's T9?
[00:57:54.160 --> 00:57:55.080]   You have to-- yes.
[00:57:55.080 --> 00:57:56.080]   Oh my god.
[00:57:56.080 --> 00:57:56.840]   Tapped up.
[00:57:56.840 --> 00:57:57.480]   Tapped up.
[00:57:57.480 --> 00:57:58.920]   Oh, I did it backwards.
[00:57:58.920 --> 00:57:59.760]   So where's the delete thing?
[00:57:59.760 --> 00:58:02.200]   If you want the letters C, you have to tap A, A, A, A.
[00:58:02.200 --> 00:58:03.880]   It wasn't quite that bad.
[00:58:03.880 --> 00:58:06.720]   But they basically had a display on mine anyway.
[00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:08.040]   Now, supposedly, get this.
[00:58:08.040 --> 00:58:09.600]   You can hook it up to your phone.
[00:58:09.600 --> 00:58:10.080]   You can--
[00:58:10.080 --> 00:58:10.560]   You're reading the--
[00:58:10.560 --> 00:58:11.400]   --tooth it to your phone.
[00:58:11.400 --> 00:58:11.600]   Yeah.
[00:58:11.600 --> 00:58:12.600]   No, the GPS--
[00:58:12.600 --> 00:58:14.240]   GPS, the Garmin.
[00:58:14.240 --> 00:58:17.400]   So you can then go in on your phone and use that keyboard.
[00:58:17.400 --> 00:58:19.560]   So I brought up a Bluetooth keyboard.
[00:58:19.560 --> 00:58:21.680]   So I could Bluetooth to my phone, which
[00:58:21.680 --> 00:58:24.680]   would then Bluetooth to the Garmin.
[00:58:24.680 --> 00:58:28.840]   But unfortunately, I got up to the North Pole effectively
[00:58:28.840 --> 00:58:31.360]   and got ready to sign everything up--
[00:58:31.360 --> 00:58:33.600]   or to get going because I had already signed it up
[00:58:33.600 --> 00:58:34.360]   when I was down here.
[00:58:34.360 --> 00:58:37.280]   And it said, hey, I can't find the domain server.
[00:58:37.280 --> 00:58:38.320]   The domain server.
[00:58:38.320 --> 00:58:40.400]   Wait, why would you have to do that for something
[00:58:40.400 --> 00:58:42.960]   that's designed to operate out in the wild?
[00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:44.200]   The domain server.
[00:58:44.200 --> 00:58:44.960]   Yeah.
[00:58:44.960 --> 00:58:46.120]   That's really upsetting.
[00:58:46.120 --> 00:58:47.680]   And you called us--
[00:58:47.680 --> 00:58:50.360]   we heard from you every week via Iridium, which
[00:58:50.360 --> 00:58:52.240]   is a satellite phone service.
[00:58:52.240 --> 00:58:54.280]   How many of those are left?
[00:58:54.280 --> 00:58:54.800]   I don't know.
[00:58:54.800 --> 00:58:57.320]   Because our service was a bit small.
[00:58:57.320 --> 00:59:00.600]   When Iridium launched, it failed pretty--
[00:59:00.600 --> 00:59:02.320]   it was Motorola, I feel like?
[00:59:02.320 --> 00:59:03.000]   I think so.
[00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:04.840]   It failed pretty quickly.
[00:59:04.840 --> 00:59:08.360]   And it was like a batch of 16 and then another 16.
[00:59:08.360 --> 00:59:09.920]   There are 66 satellites.
[00:59:09.920 --> 00:59:10.680]   66, OK.
[00:59:10.680 --> 00:59:12.600]   And they're geostationary, I think.
[00:59:12.600 --> 00:59:15.040]   They're floating right above you at all time.
[00:59:15.040 --> 00:59:15.360]   Right.
[00:59:15.360 --> 00:59:17.680]   But they still kind of bump along the horizon over the day.
[00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:19.160]   Oh, so they're not geostation?
[00:59:19.160 --> 00:59:22.400]   So well, so we had time of day issues.
[00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:25.560]   It could have been weather, but certainly standing outside
[00:59:25.560 --> 00:59:28.800]   under a clear blue sky, they would connect and disconnect
[00:59:28.800 --> 00:59:29.160]   and connect and connect.
[00:59:29.160 --> 00:59:30.640]   Here's a bit of history.
[00:59:30.640 --> 00:59:33.560]   The Iridium Communication Service launched in 1998.
[00:59:33.560 --> 00:59:36.160]   Becky, we know that year very well.
[00:59:36.160 --> 00:59:41.320]   The first Iridium call was made by Vice President Al Gore
[00:59:41.320 --> 00:59:44.560]   to the great grandson of Alexander Graham Bell, Gilbert
[00:59:44.560 --> 00:59:47.800]   Grovesner, who was the chairman of the National Geographic
[00:59:47.800 --> 00:59:48.800]   Society.
[00:59:48.800 --> 00:59:51.760]   Motorola, yeah, provided the technology.
[00:59:51.760 --> 00:59:55.680]   But I remember, yeah, nine months after the launch,
[00:59:55.680 --> 00:59:58.080]   they went into bankruptcy.
[00:59:58.080 --> 01:00:00.040]   The handsets could not operate as promoted
[01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:02.960]   until the entire constellation of satellites was in place.
[01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:05.960]   And that was going to cost so much money
[01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:10.200]   that they just folded, which, of course, means nobody bought--
[01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:12.400]   it was one of those catch-22s, which means nobody
[01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:16.280]   bought the phones, which means they couldn't do anything more.
[01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:19.960]   Apparently, it was also fairly mismanaged.
[01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:23.120]   But eventually, in fact, the 2000 Motorola
[01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:25.840]   said we're going to have to de-orbit these.
[01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:27.200]   We're going to have to bring them back.
[01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:28.120]   Yeah, that's why I was saying that.
[01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:30.120]   They remain in orbit and operational.
[01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:35.520]   The government, the US government, as opposed to the queen,
[01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:38.120]   stepped in to save Iridium by providing $72 million
[01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:39.960]   in exchange for a two-year contract--
[01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:41.480]   I'm reading from Wikipedia--
[01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:44.120]   and approving the fire sale of the company that
[01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:45.440]   erased $4 billion in debt.
[01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:49.240]   It was restarted in 2001 by the new Iridium satellite
[01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:53.040]   LLC owned by a group of private investors.
[01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:56.200]   So that's why you could use that.
[01:00:56.200 --> 01:00:58.040]   They replaced the original constellation
[01:00:58.040 --> 01:01:03.640]   they sent 75 new satellites up on, SpaceX Falcon 9 rockets.
[01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:05.320]   Again, the Musk.
[01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:08.240]   It all rosely to Elon.
[01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:09.400]   I love this concept.
[01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:10.720]   I really hope it succeeds.
[01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:12.960]   And I hope Apple brings it into their technology.
[01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:15.520]   This could save so many lives.
[01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:17.480]   I think about all the people who are--
[01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:18.280]   James Kim.
[01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:20.120]   Are dear, dear James Kim.
[01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:25.480]   First thought was James Kim, who got lost in the Oregon
[01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:27.640]   mountains, trapped in the snow.
[01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:29.680]   Nobody could find him for 10 days.
[01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:30.680]   And he died.
[01:01:30.680 --> 01:01:33.520]   And I just think about all the backcountry skiers,
[01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:34.480]   all the--
[01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:38.000]   anybody who's in nature, there's so many times
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.520]   where you're off the grid and off that coverage.
[01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:42.720]   And it's a little nerve wreck.
[01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:45.080]   And I'll say, as a mom, I would want my kids
[01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:46.760]   to have that on their phones.
[01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:50.320]   I mean, you spend a lot of time--
[01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:51.280]   you're from Hawaii.
[01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:53.680]   You spend a lot of time, I think,
[01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:54.960]   stand up paddleboarding.
[01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:58.160]   I don't know, doing stuff in wilderness.
[01:01:58.160 --> 01:01:59.800]   You probably would use this, yeah?
[01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:00.240]   Oh, yeah.
[01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:01.720]   And I fish a lot.
[01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:07.400]   And so to be out, especially now with the fires,
[01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:08.080]   you could get--
[01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:10.160]   I mean, please, I went fishing on the Tuolome River
[01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:12.920]   this summer with my son.
[01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:16.480]   And we went down this really tiny road, one way in,
[01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:17.600]   one way out.
[01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:20.360]   A week later, the fires started in Yosemite.
[01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:22.600]   And we could have been trapped in there like that.
[01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:24.200]   Easy.
[01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:24.480]   Yeah.
[01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:27.000]   And so having that kind of access,
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.480]   it's funny because you think about it
[01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:31.400]   when I used to-- before cell phones,
[01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:32.840]   used to never think about this stuff.
[01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:38.280]   But now, that access to help and first responders
[01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:39.640]   is a nice thing to have.
[01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:40.600]   Really get used to it.
[01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:42.680]   And you bring up the point of two-way communication
[01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:44.240]   because you could get the warning
[01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:45.720]   that the fire's closing in on you,
[01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:48.000]   whereas I was just thinking about it with the Garmin.
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:49.360]   Well, I got an SOS button.
[01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:51.080]   That's all I need to do.
[01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:53.920]   And somebody mentioned on the chat, by the way, in Marseette.
[01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:56.320]   We had an in-marsat box as well.
[01:02:56.320 --> 01:02:58.360]   And it worked for about an hour a day.
[01:02:58.360 --> 01:02:58.880]   Oh, wow.
[01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:01.520]   And it was because the geosynch satellites were down--
[01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:02.800]   close to the sides of you.
[01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:05.080]   Yeah, because they were used more for marine communications.
[01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:05.520]   I guess.
[01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:07.000]   But we walked up to the mountain,
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:07.880]   so we'd have a signal.
[01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:10.120]   But what's weird is it would be fine for like an hour.
[01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:13.840]   And then it would kind of vanish for the rest of the day
[01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:14.840]   when the sun didn't go down.
[01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:16.960]   The sad thing on the James Kim story
[01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:20.560]   was he was an early user of GPS.
[01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:26.680]   And his GPS map led him to a place that
[01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:28.000]   shouldn't have led him to.
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:32.640]   It showed a logging road as a true through pass
[01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:37.120]   from the highway five to cut over to the coastal route.
[01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:37.640]   Short cuts.
[01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:41.320]   It was just a logging road that wasn't open in the winter.
[01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:43.520]   So he-- and he had his kids with him and his wife.
[01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:47.680]   And they were stranded in the car.
[01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:51.320]   He went to-- I think they were burning their tires
[01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:52.040]   to stay warm.
[01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:52.240]   It was warm.
[01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:53.160]   Burned their tires.
[01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:54.520]   They had a couple snacks.
[01:03:54.520 --> 01:03:56.280]   And she was breastfeeding.
[01:03:56.280 --> 01:03:58.960]   And that's how the kids made it.
[01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:01.560]   And then after 10 days, James just
[01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:02.960]   felt like they weren't going to get found.
[01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:04.080]   Snow on the ground.
[01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:06.440]   And he went out and did--
[01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:07.280]   Oh, breaks my heart.
[01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:08.240]   He died of hexamia.
[01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:08.760]   Yeah.
[01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:09.440]   Breaks my heart.
[01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:09.960]   Yeah.
[01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:10.760]   Yeah.
[01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:14.160]   So technology failed him, where--
[01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:17.840]   let's hope technology could save people going forward.
[01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:20.880]   You know what's going to save people, Leo?
[01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:24.480]   If you say unbound.com for the cut tire.
[01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:24.980]   Sure.
[01:04:24.980 --> 01:04:26.320]   That's it.
[01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:28.640]   Yeah, the whole punch.
[01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:29.200]   Yeah.
[01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:32.200]   I mean, how did you transition after that?
[01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:33.280]   Thank you for that.
[01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:34.280]   Thank you for helping us.
[01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:36.040]   I think it's a defacto producer of this show.
[01:04:36.040 --> 01:04:37.800]   Thank you for that segue.
[01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:38.640]   A terrible segue.
[01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:40.080]   A terrible segue.
[01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:42.400]   But thank you.
[01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:44.840]   The event rumors are the notches going.
[01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:48.120]   We're going to have an Android S camera cut out for the 14.
[01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:49.120]   Yes.
[01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:51.000]   We're going to have a pro watch, which
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.160]   has a two-inch watch face.
[01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:54.040]   No.
[01:04:54.040 --> 01:04:57.120]   Two inches, 46 millimeters.
[01:04:57.120 --> 01:05:00.040]   Just two millimeters bigger, that's saying.
[01:05:00.040 --> 01:05:00.960]   Thank you.
[01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:01.960]   Two inches.
[01:05:01.960 --> 01:05:02.480]   You know what?
[01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:03.000]   Two inches.
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:04.240]   You know, I see lots of friends who
[01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:06.840]   have the enormous Rolexes or the enormous--
[01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:08.200]   Kind of, you know, protects or whatever.
[01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:08.640]   Sure.
[01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:11.320]   I just want to-- I want an Apple watch that's just going to,
[01:05:11.320 --> 01:05:13.360]   like, obscure my wrist.
[01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:17.000]   How about when you could hang around your neck?
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.880]   Like bigy swan.
[01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:20.600]   Like, dude with the--
[01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:21.120]   Yeah.
[01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:21.880]   Flavor Flav.
[01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:22.800]   Flavor Flav.
[01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:25.560]   I want the-- I want the Flavor Flav Apple Watch.
[01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:33.280]   And AirPods Pro to get what is described as a beat-esque redesign.
[01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:35.600]   I don't know what that means.
[01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:36.960]   Beats-esque.
[01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:40.680]   I talked on the show about why men wear huge watches.
[01:05:40.680 --> 01:05:42.440]   Well, let's ask Flavor Flav.
[01:05:42.440 --> 01:05:44.920]   Especially, why do they wear--
[01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:45.680]   Because they're big.
[01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:46.600]   There you go.
[01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:48.600]   Yeah.
[01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:51.280]   Men wear watches to show their masculinity.
[01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:52.960]   Big watches, right.
[01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:54.200]   But I always found it odd.
[01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:57.040]   But it's got to be big with lots of little dials and tiny numbers.
[01:05:57.040 --> 01:05:58.640]   Yeah, but here's the thing.
[01:05:58.640 --> 01:06:02.040]   So I can almost exactly tell you this.
[01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:04.920]   So as Leo will know from one of my former jobs,
[01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:08.680]   as Leo likes to point out, when I worked at Con in Ast,
[01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:12.040]   working on GQ and Vogue and that kind of thing.
[01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:12.960]   Well, you're next with that.
[01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:17.120]   Men like big watches, because it's the very few--
[01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:19.520]   one of the very few things that we get to wear is jewelry.
[01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:20.520]   We don't have any choices.
[01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:23.800]   So we mean to wear earrings, necklaces, nose piercing rings,
[01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:24.680]   all that kind of thing.
[01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:27.000]   Men basically have watches as the only thing
[01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.680]   that's socially acceptable to wear is--
[01:06:28.680 --> 01:06:29.600]   It's so funny.
[01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:30.440]   --decoration.
[01:06:30.440 --> 01:06:33.040]   That you're saying this because I had lunch--
[01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:35.800]   our dinner with Ben Parr, who's been on our shows,
[01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:36.840]   used to be a mashable.
[01:06:36.840 --> 01:06:38.240]   He's a startup guy.
[01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:39.440]   And he's wearing--
[01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:40.400]   he's not wearing an Apple Watch.
[01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:42.480]   He's wearing a Movado, big old Mov--
[01:06:42.480 --> 01:06:44.400]   and I said, why aren't you wearing an Apple Watch?
[01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:48.400]   He said, because we don't have many chances for accessorizing.
[01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:49.880]   And this is it.
[01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:53.920]   Or if you're a physician, red noses, colorful ties,
[01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:56.720]   and strange socks, there aren't a lot of choices.
[01:06:56.720 --> 01:06:58.960]   We all wear a uniform.
[01:06:58.960 --> 01:06:59.480]   Yeah.
[01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:01.720]   Well, it's interesting because the Apple Watch
[01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:04.200]   is kind of one of those great democratizers
[01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:05.320]   sort of like the Prius was.
[01:07:05.320 --> 01:07:09.240]   You can live in Los Angeles, in West Los Angeles, no less,
[01:07:09.240 --> 01:07:13.960]   and drive a Prius, and wear crummy jeans and a $500 t-shirt.
[01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:16.280]   People can't figure out how much money you make.
[01:07:16.280 --> 01:07:17.600]   They assume you're loaded.
[01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:18.400]   The same thing is--
[01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:20.120]   Once they see my nipple ring, they know.
[01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:21.280]   Ow.
[01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:22.280]   Ow.
[01:07:22.280 --> 01:07:23.920]   I'm just kidding.
[01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:25.160]   I stole that from the chair.
[01:07:25.160 --> 01:07:26.160]   Pliono.
[01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:29.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:31.440]   But have you ever had a big chronograph?
[01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:32.280]   A big what?
[01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:33.320]   You know, one of those big, right?
[01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:34.440]   Oh, I thought you were talking about that.
[01:07:34.440 --> 01:07:35.440]   No.
[01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:37.200]   Ooh.
[01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:38.200]   No.
[01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:40.160]   Yes, I've had big watches.
[01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:42.760]   But the Apple Watch is a big watch.
[01:07:42.760 --> 01:07:44.560]   No, but I mean, like, the detailed--
[01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:45.560]   Yeah, I've had those big--
[01:07:45.560 --> 01:07:47.480]   You've got those big planet Earth, and that kind of thing.
[01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:50.600]   And I bought one just because it was on sale.
[01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:51.680]   It was on Prime Day.
[01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:53.400]   It was a Seiko Cordura or something.
[01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:54.120]   Those are beautiful.
[01:07:54.120 --> 01:07:55.760]   I think they're going to look like a Breitling,
[01:07:55.760 --> 01:07:56.840]   in order of quick glance.
[01:07:56.840 --> 01:07:58.520]   And I thought, well, I'll take that to the events
[01:07:58.520 --> 01:08:01.400]   where I have to try and build up my stubby stuff.
[01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:02.920]   And I'm going to do a little statue.
[01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:05.120]   And I cannot learn how to use the thing.
[01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:08.200]   It took me an hour to figure out how to set the time zone.
[01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:08.720]   Yeah.
[01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:10.280]   And now it's got all this other stuff on it.
[01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:12.440]   And then, oh, I have to set the--
[01:08:12.440 --> 01:08:15.440]   And I had to get out the instruction book
[01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:18.120]   to figure out how to use-- and then the second hand
[01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:19.480]   just drives me back.
[01:08:19.480 --> 01:08:22.120]   So I went back to wearing my little Chinese workout watch
[01:08:22.120 --> 01:08:22.800]   instead.
[01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:28.200]   My watch is-- well, I'll show you my new watch, which is--
[01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:30.200]   I think it might be a little too big.
[01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:31.200]   I don't know.
[01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:33.120]   I'm just thinking it just might be a little too large.
[01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:35.480]   John's bringing it in.
[01:08:35.480 --> 01:08:38.000]   I don't even think I could wear this around my neck, actually.
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:43.000]   I've never seen one of these metal before.
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:44.000]   They're usually siring.
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:44.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:45.400]   No, these are nice.
[01:08:45.400 --> 01:08:46.640]   This is a real deal.
[01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:47.160]   Wow.
[01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:47.680]   Yeah.
[01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:50.160]   It might be a little big flavor flavor layer.
[01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:51.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:52.960]   It's very wears Anderson Lee area.
[01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:55.080]   I can see you holding it and just sort of--
[01:08:55.080 --> 01:08:57.680]   you're in the middle of a shot in a Wes Anderson movie.
[01:08:57.680 --> 01:08:58.480]   I've never had a watch.
[01:08:58.480 --> 01:08:59.440]   You had to roll on it.
[01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:02.240]   You could roll it out of here.
[01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:04.120]   All right, moving right along.
[01:09:04.120 --> 01:09:06.240]   Anyway, with the Apple event a week from Wednesday,
[01:09:06.240 --> 01:09:09.040]   we will stream it live.
[01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:11.120]   Michael Sargent got an invitation,
[01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:12.600]   so he will be going down there.
[01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:14.040]   Interesting thing about the invitation,
[01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:16.880]   it did say the Steve Jobs Theater.
[01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:17.400]   So we were--
[01:09:17.400 --> 01:09:18.800]   It's going to be in person, right?
[01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:21.880]   Not only is it in person, it's going to be inside.
[01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:25.240]   So the last thing Apple did, WWDC, they did it at the campus,
[01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:26.240]   but they did it outside.
[01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:28.480]   There's lots of room outside there.
[01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:31.920]   The invitation specifically says the Steve Jobs Theater.
[01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:35.000]   Well, it kind of goes along with the Tim Cook three days
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:36.120]   back to work, right?
[01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:38.080]   So Apple's clearly like this is it.
[01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:39.480]   We're all back to normality, right?
[01:09:39.480 --> 01:09:39.960]   It's over.
[01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:40.800]   COVID's over.
[01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:42.880]   But I'm sort of stuck on Micah getting the invite,
[01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:48.040]   because surely they know he's the up and coming rising star.
[01:09:48.040 --> 01:09:50.440]   Apparently they don't mention that.
[01:09:50.440 --> 01:09:51.200]   Apple.
[01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:52.200]   He doesn't know me.
[01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:53.040]   Never met me.
[01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:53.840]   Never met the man.
[01:09:53.840 --> 01:09:54.680]   Hands over.
[01:09:54.680 --> 01:09:56.080]   You're good to go.
[01:09:56.080 --> 01:09:58.880]   No, it's funny, because Gizmodo got invited back.
[01:09:58.880 --> 01:10:01.360]   Becky Worley got invited back.
[01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:03.760]   Seems like--
[01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:05.240]   Did you do any penance, Becky?
[01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:07.200]   Did you kiss the ring or anything?
[01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:08.520]   I have kissed the ring.
[01:10:08.520 --> 01:10:10.200]   You've kissed the ring.
[01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:11.280]   I have kissed the ring.
[01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:13.560]   I don't care, because somebody has to--
[01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:16.040]   these things, in fact, more and more I'm thinking,
[01:10:16.040 --> 01:10:19.520]   these are just big adverts.
[01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:22.240]   Why do we cover them like we do?
[01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:25.600]   Well, there was a great article about how tech products
[01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:27.200]   are no longer announced.
[01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:28.320]   They're dropped.
[01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:28.960]   Yeah.
[01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:31.640]   And the product drop is now an event,
[01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:33.600]   just like an album launching.
[01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:38.080]   And so it's just the opportunity to just bring the hype,
[01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:38.880]   basically.
[01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:40.880]   Yeah, and I don't want to be complicit in that.
[01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:46.120]   So what we do is we stream it, but we then comment on it
[01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:47.160]   and try to give it some--
[01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:50.280]   grounded in some reality.
[01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:51.280]   I don't know.
[01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:51.800]   I'm wondering.
[01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:53.520]   Go ahead, Will.
[01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:56.040]   Well, I was just going to say, my grandmother
[01:10:56.040 --> 01:10:59.520]   blessed her soul at 98 years old.
[01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:01.520]   Just once had the insight, she was saying,
[01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:03.200]   I was sort of explaining what I was doing
[01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:03.920]   or what I was working on.
[01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:07.080]   And she said, nothing can ever just
[01:11:07.080 --> 01:11:08.680]   appear in a shop these days.
[01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:10.800]   It has to be launched.
[01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:12.880]   Everything has to have a launch.
[01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:13.400]   I love her.
[01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:16.440]   And my 98-year-old grandmother grasped this idea of,
[01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:18.880]   everything needs a launch.
[01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:22.680]   And I think, whatever Apple's going to do on September 7,
[01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:26.240]   it will well and truly be launched.
[01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:28.920]   You know what else will be launched?
[01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:31.040]   Lieutenant Urura.
[01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:33.400]   Oh, Urura Ashes.
[01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:34.400]   That's a segue, right?
[01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:39.680]   Michelle Nichols Ashes.
[01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:40.680]   Wow.
[01:11:40.680 --> 01:11:41.360]   Wow.
[01:11:41.360 --> 01:11:42.920]   Sure.
[01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:43.720]   I didn't know this.
[01:11:43.720 --> 01:11:45.640]   There's a company that does this.
[01:11:45.640 --> 01:11:46.560]   So this is--
[01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:51.040]   This is their business of taking remains into space.
[01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:52.280]   They sample.
[01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:53.640]   So they take just a thimble of you.
[01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:54.240]   They don't take--
[01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:55.040]   A little bit.
[01:11:55.040 --> 01:11:55.840]   Yeah.
[01:11:55.840 --> 01:11:58.320]   Michelle Nichols, who recently passed, of course,
[01:11:58.320 --> 01:12:01.040]   Lieutenant Urura from Star Trek,
[01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:04.400]   will be on the next flight.
[01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:06.600]   She won't be alone, by the way.
[01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:11.240]   She will be accompanied by ashes from Scotty, James Doohan,
[01:12:11.240 --> 01:12:14.320]   ashes from Jean Roddenberry, and Jean's wife,
[01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:16.440]   Magelle Roddenberry.
[01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:20.960]   But it's not the first time any of those others
[01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:21.800]   have been in space.
[01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:23.440]   I was going to say Scotty already went.
[01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:24.080]   All of them.
[01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:25.040]   That's kind of weird.
[01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:25.720]   All of them.
[01:12:25.720 --> 01:12:27.000]   OK.
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:28.880]   So they had some leftovers, you say?
[01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:30.200]   Well, that's why I think it really is.
[01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:32.480]   It's like a little tiny bit.
[01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:33.920]   Do they go back to the urn and say,
[01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:35.360]   can we have a little bit more?
[01:12:35.360 --> 01:12:35.880]   I don't know.
[01:12:35.880 --> 01:12:37.320]   You don't have to ask the urn.
[01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:38.000]   You just take it.
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:38.480]   OK.
[01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:40.280]   I've got a couple of those.
[01:12:40.280 --> 01:12:45.240]   So the Celestis Voyager Memorial Space Flight
[01:12:45.240 --> 01:12:48.440]   launch from Cape Canaveral.
[01:12:48.440 --> 01:12:51.680]   Is it a SpaceX rocket?
[01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:52.480]   It wasn't.
[01:12:52.480 --> 01:12:53.880]   This one might be.
[01:12:53.880 --> 01:12:57.360]   You know, for my money, if I'm going to do something like that,
[01:12:57.360 --> 01:13:00.280]   I want to launch a whole bone.
[01:13:00.280 --> 01:13:00.760]   OK.
[01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:01.280]   That's creepy.
[01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:01.960]   Not creamy.
[01:13:01.960 --> 01:13:02.480]   It's so big.
[01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:03.320]   There's a reason.
[01:13:03.320 --> 01:13:06.120]   So first of all, you get that 2001 moment
[01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:07.520]   of the bone drifting in space.
[01:13:07.520 --> 01:13:08.000]   Oh, geez.
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:08.960]   The Stanley Kubrick did.
[01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:12.760]   But then you aim it for reentry so my kid can come out
[01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:15.480]   and laugh and clap while my bone burns up.
[01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:16.640]   And you can watch it.
[01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:19.480]   I mean, that'd be much cooler than just the idea that, oh, you
[01:13:19.480 --> 01:13:21.920]   know, dad's pinky ashes are in orbit.
[01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:22.760]   So I'm--
[01:13:22.760 --> 01:13:24.720]   This is more than orbit, by the way.
[01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:27.760]   They will be sent out beyond the Lagrange
[01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:29.800]   2 point where James Webb is.
[01:13:29.800 --> 01:13:30.320]   Oh, so great.
[01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:32.400]   So now we're going to have these impacting James Webb
[01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:33.080]   in space.
[01:13:33.080 --> 01:13:34.800]   More damage on top of what we're in.
[01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:35.800]   In space.
[01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:37.080]   That was in Shenandoah.
[01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:39.560]   It's powered by a United Launch Alliance.
[01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:40.040]   I looked it up.
[01:13:40.040 --> 01:13:41.360]   Vulcan Centaur.
[01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:44.120]   Yeah, ULA, Vulcan.
[01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:44.480]   Get it.
[01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:51.360]   It will host Gene Rodbury, Major Barrett Rodbury, James Doohan.
[01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:55.320]   Not their first time up there, according to Vanity Fair.
[01:13:55.320 --> 01:13:58.560]   The first time Gene and Major went up into space.
[01:13:58.560 --> 01:13:59.160]   Am I saying that right?
[01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:00.200]   Majel, Majel.
[01:14:00.200 --> 01:14:01.200]   Majel.
[01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:02.320]   Majel.
[01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:06.240]   Was when Jim Weatherby secretly took them up
[01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:08.960]   in the space shuttle Columbia in 1992.
[01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:10.600]   How cool is that?
[01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:15.280]   In 1997, Gene was loaded into a Pegasus XL rocket
[01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:18.240]   in the Canary Islands from which ashes were launched.
[01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:20.800]   Orbited Earth for five years before re-entering.
[01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:22.280]   So there's a little bit of--
[01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:22.760]   Excellency.
[01:14:22.760 --> 01:14:25.360]   Gene Rodbury and all of us now.
[01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:27.360]   And then through Celestus, Gene and Majel
[01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:30.360]   had some of their remains set up two more times.
[01:14:30.360 --> 01:14:33.080]   So this is their fifth time.
[01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:38.000]   In 2013, their ashes were joined by Scotty
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:43.080]   and a strand of hair from Arthur C. Clark.
[01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:47.760]   This time, this company launches DNA as well as ashes.
[01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:48.600]   Yeah.
[01:14:48.600 --> 01:14:50.000]   I knew they were moving that direction.
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:53.040]   So I would just send up a skin cell, I guess.
[01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:54.840]   There's a great science fiction story
[01:14:54.840 --> 01:14:57.680]   that needs to be written here about James Doohan
[01:14:57.680 --> 01:15:00.120]   and Nichelle Nichols coming back to Earth
[01:15:00.120 --> 01:15:01.960]   because somebody cloned their DNA.
[01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:03.080]   We sent it to the aliens.
[01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:05.600]   They cloned it and sent it back.
[01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:06.040]   I don't know.
[01:15:06.040 --> 01:15:07.560]   There seems like a story there.
[01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:09.080]   I'll leave that open to you.
[01:15:09.080 --> 01:15:12.160]   There is, by the way, a chance to join them.
[01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:14.160]   You have to be dead first.
[01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:15.520]   But I'm just going to freeze my hatch.
[01:15:15.520 --> 01:15:15.920]   This is my hatch.
[01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:17.560]   I'm not getting the way of doing that whole thing.
[01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:18.960]   No, no, because you could send a pinky.
[01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:20.720]   Just freeze the head and send the rest.
[01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:22.760]   Reservations are still open.
[01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:27.880]   Starts at-- pricing starts at $12,500.
[01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:29.560]   I don't know.
[01:15:29.560 --> 01:15:30.480]   And that's for specs.
[01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:32.480]   See, if they were going to launch all of me cremated,
[01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:33.760]   we need a falcon heavy.
[01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:35.520]   So I don't think it's going to happen.
[01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:36.520]   Starting, Ed.
[01:15:36.520 --> 01:15:37.520]   This is so curious.
[01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:38.520]   Starting it.
[01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:39.080]   What do you think the--
[01:15:39.080 --> 01:15:40.920]   The target price-- well, maybe that's lower in the--
[01:15:40.920 --> 01:15:41.920]   You know, in the fairing.
[01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:42.920]   And you come out last night.
[01:15:42.920 --> 01:15:43.640]   The upsell.
[01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:45.040]   What's the upsell on your hatch?
[01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:46.040]   What is the upsell?
[01:15:46.040 --> 01:15:48.040]   You can get a memorial service.
[01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:49.480]   A launch pad tour.
[01:15:49.480 --> 01:15:50.280]   Doesn't really help.
[01:15:50.280 --> 01:15:52.320]   The ash is much of a lower ash holder.
[01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:55.080]   Yeah.
[01:15:55.080 --> 01:15:57.200]   There's Gene and Majel.
[01:15:57.200 --> 01:15:57.960]   Hugh Daniel.
[01:15:57.960 --> 01:15:58.720]   Drew it.
[01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:01.440]   I'm really disturbed by the fact that the font on that website
[01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:05.480]   is basically the halo font, which makes it seem very white.
[01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:06.480]   Wow.
[01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:07.480]   That's a box.
[01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:09.840]   This is going to be-- yeah.
[01:16:09.840 --> 01:16:11.440]   Is that really the halo font?
[01:16:11.440 --> 01:16:12.440]   That's a--
[01:16:12.440 --> 01:16:13.720]   Yeah, it's very, very similar.
[01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:14.640]   Is there a date on this?
[01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:16.920]   Because the falcon's not flying yet.
[01:16:16.920 --> 01:16:17.920]   Wow.
[01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:18.680]   Did they say when?
[01:16:18.680 --> 01:16:21.720]   Launch schedule.
[01:16:21.720 --> 01:16:22.720]   Scheduled.
[01:16:22.720 --> 01:16:23.560]   Into the laser.
[01:16:23.560 --> 01:16:26.360]   Memorial flights, the Aurora flight, the Tranquility flight,
[01:16:26.360 --> 01:16:28.120]   the Destiny flight, the Enterprise flight,
[01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:29.200]   and the Excelsior flight.
[01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:31.080]   Yeah, they're all scheduled.
[01:16:31.080 --> 01:16:32.480]   They're all scheduled.
[01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:42.040]   Later 2022 for some of these, November 2022, Q4, 2023,
[01:16:42.040 --> 01:16:44.400]   February 2023.
[01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:47.080]   This is the most popular memorial space flight service.
[01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:52.920]   All the dozens of people that have done it since 2000
[01:16:52.920 --> 01:16:53.680]   when we started.
[01:16:53.680 --> 01:16:56.360]   This reminds me of this very cool service
[01:16:56.360 --> 01:16:58.960]   that was coming out of Japan about three years ago, four
[01:16:58.960 --> 01:17:01.200]   years ago maybe, where they were launching--
[01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:02.640]   I think it was before I came on your show--
[01:17:02.640 --> 01:17:08.440]   they were launching little cans of tungsten ball bearings
[01:17:08.440 --> 01:17:11.600]   coated in different chemicals so you could have a bespoke
[01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:12.400]   meteor shower.
[01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:15.440]   So if you're having a wedding reception, it's outside,
[01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:17.680]   it's sunset, this thing's going overhead
[01:17:17.680 --> 01:17:18.600]   at that exact moment.
[01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:20.680]   And it would have a little explosive charge that would
[01:17:20.680 --> 01:17:22.760]   blast all these tungsten balls out,
[01:17:22.760 --> 01:17:25.760]   and they'd re-enter in this big plume of different colors.
[01:17:25.760 --> 01:17:27.200]   That's like special fireworks.
[01:17:27.200 --> 01:17:28.200]   A little expensive.
[01:17:28.200 --> 01:17:29.280]   Yeah.
[01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:31.960]   A little questionable environmentally to some,
[01:17:31.960 --> 01:17:33.600]   but I thought it was a really cool idea.
[01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:35.120]   If you want to go up, reservations
[01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:38.280]   close August 31st for the Enterprise flight, which
[01:17:38.280 --> 01:17:42.720]   will be later this year, or as soon as you are liking it,
[01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:45.680]   a space launch vehicle up and running.
[01:17:45.680 --> 01:17:48.120]   And they will stream the more memorial service in the launch
[01:17:48.120 --> 01:17:51.560]   live via webcast.
[01:17:51.560 --> 01:17:53.560]   Payment plan is available.
[01:17:53.560 --> 01:17:55.240]   Let's sign right up.
[01:17:55.240 --> 01:17:56.480]   Let's take a little break.
[01:17:56.480 --> 01:18:00.880]   Our show today brought to you by userway.org.
[01:18:00.880 --> 01:18:02.640]   Userway.org.
[01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:06.840]   I'm talking about making your website ADA compliant,
[01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:08.080]   accessible.
[01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:09.720]   Not only is it the right thing to do,
[01:18:09.720 --> 01:18:11.880]   because you're opening up your website
[01:18:11.880 --> 01:18:15.480]   to a much larger group, 60 million plus people,
[01:18:15.480 --> 01:18:18.320]   you have a responsibility to make your site accessible.
[01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:20.960]   It's a public entity, so you've got to make it accessible.
[01:18:20.960 --> 01:18:23.480]   And with Userway, it's easy.
[01:18:23.480 --> 01:18:25.920]   That was my biggest concern was, oh, I can't afford it,
[01:18:25.920 --> 01:18:27.040]   it's going to be too hard.
[01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:30.200]   No, Userway is really affordable, and it's really easy.
[01:18:30.200 --> 01:18:30.960]   And incredible.
[01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:32.280]   It's AI powered.
[01:18:32.280 --> 01:18:35.560]   It tirelessly enforces all the accessibility guidelines,
[01:18:35.560 --> 01:18:38.400]   the WCAG WCAG guidelines.
[01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:40.720]   And I love this, so do our engineers.
[01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:42.360]   It's one line of JavaScript.
[01:18:42.360 --> 01:18:43.120]   That's it.
[01:18:43.120 --> 01:18:44.880]   Because Userway is so good, it's used
[01:18:44.880 --> 01:18:47.720]   by more than a million websites, including the big guys,
[01:18:47.720 --> 01:18:50.240]   Coca-Cola, Disney, eBay.
[01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:53.280]   These are companies that really have to be accessible.
[01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:54.680]   And Userway can do that.
[01:18:54.680 --> 01:18:57.160]   As you get bigger, they scale with you.
[01:18:57.160 --> 01:19:00.760]   If they can handle Disney, absolutely they can handle you.
[01:19:00.760 --> 01:19:03.640]   They make best in class enterprise level accessibility
[01:19:03.640 --> 01:19:07.440]   tools available to you, your small or medium sized business.
[01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:10.680]   And then as you scale, you need Userway, and you're ready.
[01:19:10.680 --> 01:19:12.240]   It just makes business sense.
[01:19:12.240 --> 01:19:15.480]   Some of the biggest problems, nav menus, very difficult.
[01:19:15.480 --> 01:19:17.640]   So the way this works, if you're blind or you're
[01:19:17.640 --> 01:19:20.720]   using accessibility tools, there is what they call
[01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:22.080]   an accessibility layer.
[01:19:22.080 --> 01:19:24.480]   That's what the screen reader sees.
[01:19:24.480 --> 01:19:28.000]   So really, what Userway does is make sure that all the information
[01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.680]   available to the front page to the sighted user
[01:19:30.680 --> 01:19:34.000]   is available to the browser in the accessibility layer.
[01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:35.600]   It changes colors.
[01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:37.840]   Now, you've got your Pantone color for your business.
[01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:39.080]   Of course, we do too.
[01:19:39.080 --> 01:19:40.440]   Doesn't change that.
[01:19:40.440 --> 01:19:43.160]   But it adjusts hue and luminance, so it's easier for people
[01:19:43.160 --> 01:19:45.120]   with vision issues to read.
[01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:46.880]   So Userway will generate alt tags.
[01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:48.360]   That's one of the reasons it needs AI.
[01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:50.720]   It can actually see the picture and generate an alt tag that
[01:19:50.720 --> 01:19:52.760]   matches the picture automatically.
[01:19:52.760 --> 01:19:53.840]   You can go in if you want.
[01:19:53.840 --> 01:19:55.920]   You can modify it, of course.
[01:19:55.920 --> 01:20:00.040]   It fixes violations like vague links, fixes broken links,
[01:20:00.040 --> 01:20:03.640]   make sure that your website uses accessible colors.
[01:20:03.640 --> 01:20:06.160]   And you'll get a detailed report of all the violations
[01:20:06.160 --> 01:20:09.320]   that were fixed on your website, so you know exactly what it did.
[01:20:09.320 --> 01:20:10.960]   Plus, you can work with it.
[01:20:10.960 --> 01:20:15.720]   Userway integrates seamlessly with your site builder software.
[01:20:15.720 --> 01:20:18.520]   Let Userway help your business meet its compliance goals,
[01:20:18.520 --> 01:20:20.480]   improve the experience for your users.

[01:20:27.280 --> 01:20:29.000]   customize it to fit their needs.

[01:20:31.480 --> 01:20:34.000]   to the millions of people with disabilities.
[01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.400]   It's the right thing to do.

[01:20:38.920 --> 01:20:39.760]   an ADA compliant.

[01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:42.800]   we've got it running on twit.tv.
[01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:44.240]   Just look at the lower right corner.

[01:21:21.880 --> 01:21:23.160]   We've got a lot of space news, actually.
[01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:25.000]   It's really good you're here, Rod,
[01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:28.320]   because there's tons of space news this week.
[01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:30.840]   James, how long has the web been up now?
[01:21:30.840 --> 01:21:32.760]   It's not long.
[01:21:32.760 --> 01:21:36.240]   - Well, yeah, it's been eight or nine months,
[01:21:36.240 --> 01:21:37.960]   I say, launched it, but it's only been commissioned
[01:21:37.960 --> 01:21:40.280]   for like six weeks, eight weeks, like that.
[01:21:40.280 --> 01:21:42.000]   - A lot of beautiful images.
[01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.360]   - So it was gone for almost a month.
[01:21:44.360 --> 01:21:45.200]   - Anyway.
[01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:46.360]   - So yeah, about two months.
[01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:47.200]   - Two months.
[01:21:47.200 --> 01:21:48.400]   - That's what we did our thing.
[01:21:48.400 --> 01:21:50.200]   - Hard to believe that it is already,
[01:21:50.200 --> 01:21:51.680]   so one of the things web is looking at,
[01:21:51.680 --> 01:21:54.480]   but by the way, we saw Jupiter, which was cool.
[01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:57.560]   So they can look back at our solar system,
[01:21:57.560 --> 01:22:00.280]   but they found the first exoplanet,
[01:22:00.280 --> 01:22:04.520]   non-solar system planet with carbon dioxide,
[01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:09.080]   which is a big deal?
[01:22:09.080 --> 01:22:13.400]   - Well, it helps them understand how the planet was formed,
[01:22:13.400 --> 01:22:15.600]   and apparently the large part of it
[01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:18.120]   is the differential between solids and gases
[01:22:18.120 --> 01:22:19.480]   when it's in a secretion phase.
[01:22:19.480 --> 01:22:20.800]   - It's not somewhere you'd want to live.
[01:22:20.800 --> 01:22:23.320]   - It's 1,600 degrees Fahrenheit.
[01:22:23.320 --> 01:22:26.040]   - Well, that's the bummer about these first exoplanet observations
[01:22:26.040 --> 01:22:28.480]   of the ones we've been seeing for years is there are all the ones
[01:22:28.480 --> 01:22:32.000]   that are a lot of them are Jupiter sized or larger,
[01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.600]   and they're practically skimming the surface of the star.
[01:22:34.600 --> 01:22:36.760]   Some of these things orbit in hours.
[01:22:36.760 --> 01:22:38.840]   - Yeah, this one is a four day year.
[01:22:38.840 --> 01:22:39.680]   - Yeah.
[01:22:39.680 --> 01:22:40.520]   - It's so close to its sun.
[01:22:40.520 --> 01:22:41.840]   - And it's why it's so hot.
[01:22:41.840 --> 01:22:43.280]   - So it's almost like a two,
[01:22:43.280 --> 01:22:45.720]   like a berry center two star system in a sense.
[01:22:45.720 --> 01:22:47.440]   - They call it puffy.
[01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:50.320]   - Yeah, that's kind of insulting, isn't it?
[01:22:50.320 --> 01:22:51.760]   - Puffy planet.
[01:22:51.760 --> 01:22:53.760]   - They're having trouble seeing some of the light through it,
[01:22:53.760 --> 01:22:55.200]   which leads them to believe there's a quote,
[01:22:55.200 --> 01:22:58.480]   mystery molecule helping include some of the frequencies.
[01:22:58.480 --> 01:23:00.600]   But anything they find at this point,
[01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:03.520]   it's such a virgin actually being able to see the spectra
[01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:05.800]   from these exoplanets, it's such a virgin territory.
[01:23:05.800 --> 01:23:07.120]   It's all going to be exciting for a while.
[01:23:07.120 --> 01:23:09.040]   - That's actually why this is important.
[01:23:09.040 --> 01:23:12.240]   Not so much that this planet has carbon dioxide,
[01:23:12.240 --> 01:23:13.400]   but it means they can't,
[01:23:13.400 --> 01:23:16.400]   it looks good that they can detect atmospheres
[01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:19.600]   on smaller, more, maybe terrestrial sites.
[01:23:19.600 --> 01:23:21.960]   So that's what we want is to see these rocky planets
[01:23:21.960 --> 01:23:23.800]   and try and figure out what's going on there.
[01:23:23.800 --> 01:23:25.720]   'Cause then if you see a lot of a certain kind of gas,
[01:23:25.720 --> 01:23:26.880]   you can begin saying, well,
[01:23:26.880 --> 01:23:28.720]   maybe something's going on here,
[01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:32.960]   like technology or plants or animals or something.
[01:23:32.960 --> 01:23:35.920]   - I love it again, I'm thinking science fiction.
[01:23:35.920 --> 01:23:37.120]   When I first read this, I thought,
[01:23:37.120 --> 01:23:39.040]   oh great, we found a planet that killed itself
[01:23:39.040 --> 01:23:39.960]   through climate change.
[01:23:39.960 --> 01:23:40.800]   Fantastic.
[01:23:40.800 --> 01:23:41.800]   - That was the first thing.
[01:23:41.800 --> 01:23:44.440]   It's like, oh Venus, what a nice place to have a vacation.
[01:23:44.440 --> 01:23:46.880]   - Yeah, 900 degrees and 900 degrees.
[01:23:46.880 --> 01:23:49.640]   Anyway, the James Webb gift that keeps on,
[01:23:49.640 --> 01:23:52.720]   oh and will giving, it's really great.
[01:23:52.720 --> 01:23:57.720]   Last pass, which was for many years a sponsor of our shows,
[01:23:57.720 --> 01:24:01.040]   it is one of the most used,
[01:24:01.040 --> 01:24:04.340]   if not the most used password manager out there,
[01:24:04.340 --> 01:24:07.840]   as admitted they were hacked.
[01:24:07.840 --> 01:24:10.120]   Lawrence Abrams at the Bleeping Computer
[01:24:10.120 --> 01:24:12.160]   had this story two weeks ago, he asked them,
[01:24:12.160 --> 01:24:14.400]   they didn't, they clammed up,
[01:24:14.400 --> 01:24:19.400]   but finally this week admitted that they were in fact hacked,
[01:24:19.400 --> 01:24:23.840]   but to reassure you, if you use LastPass,
[01:24:23.840 --> 01:24:26.160]   there's no evidence that customer data
[01:24:26.160 --> 01:24:29.280]   or password vaults were compromised.
[01:24:29.280 --> 01:24:33.440]   The threat actors stole portions of the LastPass source code
[01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:36.320]   and something LastPass calls proprietary
[01:24:36.320 --> 01:24:39.300]   LastPass technical information.
[01:24:39.300 --> 01:24:42.640]   - Hmm, hmm, hmm.
[01:24:43.600 --> 01:24:47.480]   - Well, it did force me to go check my security settings
[01:24:47.480 --> 01:24:49.640]   and turn on two factor authentication,
[01:24:49.640 --> 01:24:50.520]   which I hadn't done.
[01:24:50.520 --> 01:24:51.360]   - Oh, yes.
[01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:54.520]   - Changed my password, which I hadn't done for a while,
[01:24:54.520 --> 01:24:57.960]   and so if nothing else, it at least lit a fire on in my butt
[01:24:57.960 --> 01:24:59.680]   'cause this one scared me.
[01:24:59.680 --> 01:25:03.640]   - Yeah, and I guess the worst case scenario,
[01:25:03.640 --> 01:25:06.760]   they don't have the passwords in clear.
[01:25:06.760 --> 01:25:08.400]   The worst case scenario would be though
[01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:11.320]   that they got the vaults, which most people
[01:25:11.320 --> 01:25:13.920]   who's used LastPass store on LastPass servers,
[01:25:13.920 --> 01:25:17.040]   and then could at their leisure attempt to brute force them.
[01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:20.320]   And if so, if you didn't have a good master password,
[01:25:20.320 --> 01:25:22.960]   you might be vulnerable at that point.
[01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:27.120]   Since we all put the keys to the kingdom in our password vaults,
[01:25:27.120 --> 01:25:28.360]   I don't use LastPass anymore,
[01:25:28.360 --> 01:25:32.280]   but no matter what you use, that's got everything in it.
[01:25:32.280 --> 01:25:36.640]   It would behoove you to use one, a good long password.
[01:25:36.640 --> 01:25:39.480]   It's just hard because you have to remember that one
[01:25:39.480 --> 01:25:41.000]   for your master password.
[01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:44.200]   I'm sure Becky, you did not use Monkey123.
[01:25:44.200 --> 01:25:46.040]   - No, it was a password 123.
[01:25:46.040 --> 01:25:49.520]   - Much better, and make sure the O's are zeros.
[01:25:49.520 --> 01:25:52.880]   Okay, a little elite tip there for you.
[01:25:52.880 --> 01:25:55.040]   No, use a good long, strong, somewhat.
[01:25:55.040 --> 01:25:56.280]   You know what I do?
[01:25:56.280 --> 01:25:58.840]   I'm not gonna use a 28 character random password.
[01:25:58.840 --> 01:26:00.680]   No one's got time to memorize that.
[01:26:00.680 --> 01:26:05.680]   I take, I don't wanna be too explicit about what I'm doing
[01:26:05.680 --> 01:26:08.720]   'cause I don't want you to reverse engineer it.
[01:26:08.720 --> 01:26:12.480]   But let's say you took, maybe you memorized Will,
[01:26:12.480 --> 01:26:15.480]   I know because you had a good public school education,
[01:26:15.480 --> 01:26:18.040]   you have memorized many great poems.
[01:26:18.040 --> 01:26:23.040]   Let's say you had Lord Tennyson poem committed to memory.
[01:26:23.040 --> 01:26:27.600]   Half league, half league, half league onward.
[01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:30.200]   The light brigade, right?
[01:26:30.200 --> 01:26:33.000]   - Yeah, so a great, a great--
[01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:34.000]   - Is it great to use--
[01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:34.840]   - For your bit, for your long--
[01:26:34.840 --> 01:26:36.520]   - I don't use that, yeah, that's what I use.
[01:26:36.520 --> 01:26:37.360]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:26:37.360 --> 01:26:40.240]   - So I think there are two interesting things to do.
[01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:43.320]   - No, let me explain what I do before we, you do that.
[01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:45.760]   So I wouldn't make my password, half a league,
[01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:47.600]   half a league, half a league, onward,
[01:26:47.600 --> 01:26:49.120]   all rolled into the Valley of Death.
[01:26:49.120 --> 01:26:54.120]   I would make it H-A-L, comma, H-A-L, H-A-L-O,
[01:26:54.120 --> 01:26:58.280]   and maybe I would do upper cases on certain kinds of words.
[01:26:58.280 --> 01:26:59.480]   Maybe I'd add punctuation.
[01:26:59.480 --> 01:27:02.360]   And then just to make it really good,
[01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:03.520]   so then I can remember,
[01:27:03.520 --> 01:27:04.480]   because I remember the poem
[01:27:04.480 --> 01:27:06.440]   and I can reconstruct the beginning part,
[01:27:06.440 --> 01:27:09.440]   I will add something else that I know.
[01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:10.680]   For instance, what I like to use
[01:27:10.680 --> 01:27:12.360]   is my childhood telephone number,
[01:27:12.360 --> 01:27:14.520]   which I memorize as a little kid,
[01:27:14.520 --> 01:27:17.360]   but is not in a phone book anywhere anymore, I hope.
[01:27:17.360 --> 01:27:23.360]   So by adding those seven or 10 extra digits,
[01:27:23.360 --> 01:27:25.120]   I think that's a pretty good password,
[01:27:25.120 --> 01:27:26.360]   not likely to be a privilege.
[01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:28.240]   - Yeah, so most security experts say
[01:27:28.240 --> 01:27:31.320]   that the best password is not a password,
[01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:35.480]   but a, either a phrase or a mnemonic.
[01:27:35.480 --> 01:27:37.440]   So a mnemonic is a great way to use it.
[01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:39.080]   - Yeah, that's what I'm using, it's a mnemonic.
[01:27:39.080 --> 01:27:42.840]   - Yeah, so take, let's take, for example,
[01:27:42.840 --> 01:27:47.000]   because I'm here, William Shakespeare in Julius Caesar says,
[01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:50.040]   "The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,
[01:27:50.040 --> 01:27:54.480]   "but in ourselves, so you would have capital T-F,
[01:27:54.480 --> 01:27:59.480]   "D, capital B, I-N-I-O-S, comma, or exclamation point,
[01:27:59.480 --> 01:28:05.000]   "let's have a special character, B-I-O."
[01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:08.000]   And that is absolutely, you know, uncrackable,
[01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:09.440]   because nobody's going, that's, you know,
[01:28:09.440 --> 01:28:11.080]   it's not a real word, but it's something
[01:28:11.080 --> 01:28:13.760]   that's easy to remember, it's a selection of random things,
[01:28:13.760 --> 01:28:15.480]   that's completely easy to remember.
[01:28:15.480 --> 01:28:16.320]   And that's a great way of doing it.
[01:28:16.320 --> 01:28:18.400]   - What do you think, to remember I'm confused?
[01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:20.880]   'Cause you know the, you know the phrase
[01:28:20.880 --> 01:28:22.880]   that you're doing in our stars, but in ourselves.
[01:28:22.880 --> 01:28:23.880]   - I guess we have a favorite.
[01:28:23.880 --> 01:28:26.480]   - Did you ever memorize anything in your life?
[01:28:26.480 --> 01:28:29.320]   - I wasn't a great elementary school student.
[01:28:29.320 --> 01:28:30.840]   I was one throwing desks out the window
[01:28:30.840 --> 01:28:31.680]   and I didn't even know that.
[01:28:31.680 --> 01:28:32.800]   - Did you know, did you, did you know,
[01:28:32.800 --> 01:28:34.680]   a Shakespeare, do you like to be or not to be,
[01:28:34.680 --> 01:28:35.800]   that is the question?
[01:28:35.800 --> 01:28:36.880]   - That's easy.
[01:28:36.880 --> 01:28:37.960]   - Okay, yeah, well you're right,
[01:28:37.960 --> 01:28:39.040]   that's probably not a good one.
[01:28:39.040 --> 01:28:39.880]   Go ahead, Beth.
[01:28:39.880 --> 01:28:42.280]   - I got another way of thinking about this.
[01:28:42.280 --> 01:28:44.440]   This is a Steve Gibson trick, which is,
[01:28:44.440 --> 01:28:46.920]   to use a password that you know pretty well,
[01:28:46.920 --> 01:28:50.840]   that might be short, and then pack it with symbols.
[01:28:50.840 --> 01:28:51.680]   - Yes.
[01:28:51.680 --> 01:28:52.520]   - Or characters.
[01:28:52.520 --> 01:28:53.640]   - That's why I do that phone number.
[01:28:53.640 --> 01:28:56.080]   He calls it password haystacks.
[01:28:56.080 --> 01:28:56.920]   - That's right.
[01:28:56.920 --> 01:28:59.000]   - Length makes it harder to brute force,
[01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:02.240]   even if you add length in a kind of trivial way.
[01:29:02.240 --> 01:29:03.520]   - But if you use characters,
[01:29:03.520 --> 01:29:04.880]   because there's so many of them,
[01:29:04.880 --> 01:29:07.280]   most he says that most brute force attack,
[01:29:07.280 --> 01:29:10.200]   they don't use as many characters
[01:29:10.200 --> 01:29:12.520]   because it's harder and it creates more variables.
[01:29:12.520 --> 01:29:15.560]   - So clearly the best password is completely long,
[01:29:15.560 --> 01:29:20.480]   random strings of alphanumeric and special characters,
[01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:22.000]   but no one can remember it, it's that.
[01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:23.600]   So that's why for your master password.
[01:29:23.600 --> 01:29:27.040]   - Becky, this Steve Gibson, guys,
[01:29:27.040 --> 01:29:29.040]   is there any where I can listen to a post-com?
[01:29:29.040 --> 01:29:29.880]   (laughing)
[01:29:29.880 --> 01:29:30.720]   - Yeah, I don't know.
[01:29:30.720 --> 01:29:31.920]   - Where can I get more of them?
[01:29:31.920 --> 01:29:33.520]   - Unbound books.com.
[01:29:33.520 --> 01:29:34.520]   No, no, that's wrong.
[01:29:34.520 --> 01:29:36.200]   (laughing)
[01:29:36.200 --> 01:29:38.320]   You're talking about the host of security now,
[01:29:38.320 --> 01:29:42.160]   which is now in its 18th year as a podcast.
[01:29:42.160 --> 01:29:45.640]   They just, he just crossed the 18 year old mark.
[01:29:45.640 --> 01:29:50.120]   And at grc.com/hastack.html, he describes this
[01:29:50.120 --> 01:29:53.800]   and shows how the larger the space
[01:29:53.800 --> 01:29:56.280]   that you have to search the more powerful it is.
[01:29:56.280 --> 01:29:59.200]   In fact, it looks like KBC produced a terrific
[01:29:59.200 --> 01:30:01.760]   and succinct two and a half minute explanation
[01:30:01.760 --> 01:30:03.160]   that you can watch.
[01:30:03.160 --> 01:30:05.320]   - That might actually be my story on this,
[01:30:05.320 --> 01:30:06.960]   that KBC re, 'cause I didn't--
[01:30:06.960 --> 01:30:07.800]   - I bet you.
[01:30:07.800 --> 01:30:09.240]   I thought it was great.
[01:30:09.240 --> 01:30:11.560]   - Yeah, I just thought it was such a smart idea
[01:30:11.560 --> 01:30:12.400]   that was simple.
[01:30:12.400 --> 01:30:13.640]   Passwords are so hard for people.
[01:30:13.640 --> 01:30:16.320]   The thing I also worry about is that
[01:30:16.320 --> 01:30:20.000]   if somebody's been pwned in a previous attack
[01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:21.920]   and they've used the same password
[01:30:21.920 --> 01:30:22.920]   as their master password.
[01:30:22.920 --> 01:30:24.280]   - That's the real problem.
[01:30:24.280 --> 01:30:26.560]   Do not reuse passwords, yes.
[01:30:26.560 --> 01:30:29.720]   - With this attack on last pass.
[01:30:29.720 --> 01:30:31.200]   - But I think the key takeaway
[01:30:31.200 --> 01:30:34.080]   is that security now is legal to drink in England, right?
[01:30:34.080 --> 01:30:35.320]   (laughing)
[01:30:35.320 --> 01:30:38.360]   - Yes, but it cannot vote yet.
[01:30:38.360 --> 01:30:39.360]   No, no, it can't vote.
[01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:40.600]   It can't drink. - No, it can vote.
[01:30:40.600 --> 01:30:42.240]   It can vote, it can drink, it can drive.
[01:30:42.240 --> 01:30:43.080]   - It can be where it could drink.
[01:30:43.080 --> 01:30:44.320]   - And it's all happening over here.
[01:30:44.320 --> 01:30:46.280]   - It can't drink here. - It gets deep over here quick.
[01:30:46.280 --> 01:30:49.680]   - It can no longer drink in the United States of America.
[01:30:49.680 --> 01:30:53.920]   Yeah, so I wouldn't worry about the last pass hack,
[01:30:53.920 --> 01:30:58.000]   although companies historically have not been very forthcoming.
[01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:01.160]   The fact that they took two weeks to confirm this,
[01:31:01.160 --> 01:31:05.000]   is cause for concern and we don't know
[01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.240]   if they know everything that happened.
[01:31:07.240 --> 01:31:08.920]   So yeah, I think that was prudent, Becky,
[01:31:08.920 --> 01:31:13.040]   change your password and if you're not using two factor,
[01:31:13.040 --> 01:31:14.720]   at least on your password vault.
[01:31:14.720 --> 01:31:18.080]   Do you even-- - Well, that wasn't a choice.
[01:31:18.080 --> 01:31:19.440]   I don't recall that being a choice
[01:31:19.440 --> 01:31:20.880]   that I didn't opt for it.
[01:31:20.880 --> 01:31:23.000]   So that kind of surprises me that it wasn't on by de-
[01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.600]   - Yeah, they should make you turn it on, yeah.
[01:31:25.600 --> 01:31:26.440]   Yeah.
[01:31:26.440 --> 01:31:28.440]   - I mean, given what it means to them for this to come out,
[01:31:28.440 --> 01:31:30.520]   what would be an appropriate period of time
[01:31:30.520 --> 01:31:32.960]   because some of those, I think you were talking about,
[01:31:32.960 --> 01:31:35.400]   was it Yahoo or who was it that took like three years?
[01:31:35.400 --> 01:31:36.680]   - Years. - Yeah.
[01:31:36.680 --> 01:31:39.120]   So a couple of weeks isn't really that bad, is it?
[01:31:39.120 --> 01:31:41.360]   - There are regulations now about how quickly
[01:31:41.360 --> 01:31:44.160]   you have to report breaches.
[01:31:44.160 --> 01:31:47.920]   In California, for instance, I think it's 72 hours.
[01:31:47.920 --> 01:31:48.760]   You have to-- - Oh.
[01:31:48.760 --> 01:31:50.120]   - You have no time at all.
[01:31:50.120 --> 01:31:51.520]   And that's a good thing.
[01:31:51.520 --> 01:31:53.720]   Let me just see the CCPA. - So even if you're not absolutely
[01:31:53.720 --> 01:31:55.520]   sure you have. - California law requires
[01:31:55.520 --> 01:31:58.160]   a business or agency to notify any California resident
[01:31:58.160 --> 01:32:00.680]   who's unencrypted personal information was acquired.
[01:32:00.680 --> 01:32:05.240]   Actually, this does not have a timer,
[01:32:05.240 --> 01:32:07.880]   but there are some with timers, maybe GDPR.
[01:32:07.880 --> 01:32:10.360]   There certainly are requirements.
[01:32:10.360 --> 01:32:12.440]   And I think that it makes sense.
[01:32:12.440 --> 01:32:13.840]   There are so many breaches now, though,
[01:32:13.840 --> 01:32:15.160]   that we don't report them anymore.
[01:32:15.160 --> 01:32:18.720]   I don't, if I were to do all the breaches this week.
[01:32:18.720 --> 01:32:20.960]   - This week breaches. - This week breaches.
[01:32:20.960 --> 01:32:22.320]   You have a whole group. - This week breaches.
[01:32:22.320 --> 01:32:24.640]   - It could be half security breaches.
[01:32:24.640 --> 01:32:26.640]   - It could be half new pants.
[01:32:26.640 --> 01:32:28.960]   - It'd be six. - Yeah, exactly.
[01:32:28.960 --> 01:32:31.640]   The main new pants for this one,
[01:32:31.640 --> 01:32:33.560]   Plex.TV, this week was--
[01:32:33.560 --> 01:32:35.160]   - This week in breaches.
[01:32:35.160 --> 01:32:37.840]   - Breached breaches.
[01:32:37.840 --> 01:32:38.760]   Or breaches.
[01:32:38.760 --> 01:32:40.520]   Actually, breaches aren't bridges.
[01:32:40.520 --> 01:32:43.560]   - Breaches are bridges. - So Leo, can you,
[01:32:43.560 --> 01:32:45.720]   'cause I'm looking at the rundown,
[01:32:45.720 --> 01:32:49.080]   can you explain the Ethereum merge to me?
[01:32:49.080 --> 01:32:51.560]   - Oh my God. - Yeah, it's struggling.
[01:32:51.560 --> 01:32:54.800]   - Is there enough time in the world to talk about this?
[01:32:54.800 --> 01:32:56.360]   Yeah, I think this is actually
[01:32:56.360 --> 01:32:58.120]   an important subject.
[01:32:58.120 --> 01:33:01.080]   So, how far back do I have to go?
[01:33:01.080 --> 01:33:03.440]   Have you ever heard of crypto currency?
[01:33:03.440 --> 01:33:05.880]   (laughing)
[01:33:05.880 --> 01:33:08.440]   - I have myself lost much money on crypto currency.
[01:33:08.440 --> 01:33:11.560]   - Oh, you've heard of that, have you?
[01:33:11.560 --> 01:33:14.960]   So the promise, it all goes back to the first cryptocurrency,
[01:33:14.960 --> 01:33:16.280]   which was Bitcoin,
[01:33:16.280 --> 01:33:18.200]   and the invention of something called a blockchain.
[01:33:18.200 --> 01:33:20.520]   The easiest way to understand blockchain is,
[01:33:20.520 --> 01:33:21.760]   it's a database.
[01:33:21.760 --> 01:33:25.040]   But unlike a database that you're probably mostly familiar with,
[01:33:25.040 --> 01:33:28.680]   where there's a central place for it,
[01:33:28.680 --> 01:33:31.040]   the blockchain is a distributed database.
[01:33:31.040 --> 01:33:34.240]   Everybody can have a copy of it,
[01:33:34.240 --> 01:33:36.080]   which gives you some advantages.
[01:33:36.080 --> 01:33:41.080]   You can't, it's harder to fake a transaction on the blockchain,
[01:33:41.080 --> 01:33:43.200]   or any entry, and by the way,
[01:33:43.200 --> 01:33:44.200]   it doesn't have to be a transaction.
[01:33:44.200 --> 01:33:46.000]   Any entry in that database,
[01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:47.360]   in fact, one of the problems of blockchain
[01:33:47.360 --> 01:33:48.560]   is there's a lot of crap in there
[01:33:48.560 --> 01:33:52.280]   that's all sorts of stuff in there.
[01:33:53.200 --> 01:33:57.160]   If, for instance, and I think it's thought to be the case,
[01:33:57.160 --> 01:33:59.240]   there were some child pornography in the blockchain,
[01:33:59.240 --> 01:34:01.280]   you couldn't actually get rid of it.
[01:34:01.280 --> 01:34:05.920]   It's preserved forever, and it's distributed forever.
[01:34:05.920 --> 01:34:09.000]   The current Bitcoin blockchain is huge,
[01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.280]   hundreds and hundreds of gigabytes.
[01:34:11.280 --> 01:34:14.480]   So that's the central technology.
[01:34:14.480 --> 01:34:17.080]   And the cryptocurrency in general,
[01:34:17.080 --> 01:34:21.480]   in order to make that transaction,
[01:34:21.480 --> 01:34:24.720]   you have to have something called a proof of work.
[01:34:24.720 --> 01:34:27.160]   And that's what the miners are doing.
[01:34:27.160 --> 01:34:30.600]   So I wanna give Rod a Bitcoin.
[01:34:30.600 --> 01:34:32.280]   Congratulations, Rod.
[01:34:32.280 --> 01:34:37.360]   The way I transact that is I use my Bitcoin wallet.
[01:34:37.360 --> 01:34:39.200]   This doesn't require a third party,
[01:34:39.200 --> 01:34:41.120]   you don't need buy and answer somebody to do this,
[01:34:41.120 --> 01:34:42.560]   I can do this, I go to my wallet,
[01:34:42.560 --> 01:34:44.280]   say, I have Rod's address,
[01:34:44.280 --> 01:34:47.400]   I send Rod this coin.
[01:34:47.400 --> 01:34:48.760]   What will then happen is,
[01:34:48.760 --> 01:34:52.640]   it will then be sent out to all the miners,
[01:34:52.640 --> 01:34:57.360]   and they all at once try to solve a difficult math problem,
[01:34:57.360 --> 01:35:00.800]   a prime number factorization problem.
[01:35:00.800 --> 01:35:03.480]   The first to solve it gets a reward,
[01:35:03.480 --> 01:35:05.520]   gets a percentage of that transaction,
[01:35:05.520 --> 01:35:07.160]   and the transaction goes through.
[01:35:07.160 --> 01:35:08.960]   When they solve it, they add it to the blockchain,
[01:35:08.960 --> 01:35:10.640]   it's now part of the blockchain.
[01:35:10.640 --> 01:35:15.440]   So the problem with that proof of work set up
[01:35:15.440 --> 01:35:17.680]   is it's very, very energy costly,
[01:35:17.680 --> 01:35:20.000]   because you have all these Bitcoin miners
[01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.200]   all racing to solve this problem,
[01:35:22.200 --> 01:35:24.600]   and when you solve it, it's a lot of energy,
[01:35:24.600 --> 01:35:27.120]   it's designed to be an increasing amount of energy
[01:35:27.120 --> 01:35:29.720]   as the currency ages.
[01:35:29.720 --> 01:35:31.560]   And so this has historically been a problem.
[01:35:31.560 --> 01:35:35.080]   I mean, currently, cryptocurrency transactions
[01:35:35.080 --> 01:35:37.920]   are using more power than some nations.
[01:35:37.920 --> 01:35:40.680]   I mean, it's a massive amount of power.
[01:35:40.680 --> 01:35:43.040]   That's how proof of work works,
[01:35:43.040 --> 01:35:45.320]   and it's not ideal.
[01:35:45.320 --> 01:35:48.200]   Early on, there was a cryptocurrency called Ethereum,
[01:35:48.200 --> 01:35:50.760]   invented by a teenager of all things.
[01:35:50.760 --> 01:35:57.120]   And he proposed that Ethereum ultimately
[01:35:57.120 --> 01:36:02.240]   could use something called proof of stake.
[01:36:02.240 --> 01:36:04.320]   This is back in 2014,
[01:36:04.320 --> 01:36:06.720]   instead of proof of work, proof of stake
[01:36:06.720 --> 01:36:10.000]   just assigns one miner, the job,
[01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.240]   doesn't use nearly as much energy.
[01:36:14.320 --> 01:36:16.240]   I like this description.
[01:36:16.240 --> 01:36:17.800]   In proof of stake systems,
[01:36:17.800 --> 01:36:21.640]   computers don't burn energy racing to verify transactions.
[01:36:21.640 --> 01:36:25.080]   Instead, crypto investors deposit a certain number
[01:36:25.080 --> 01:36:27.240]   of digital coins in a shared pool,
[01:36:27.240 --> 01:36:29.480]   and that enters them in a lottery.
[01:36:29.480 --> 01:36:31.600]   The winner of the lottery is the one who gets
[01:36:31.600 --> 01:36:33.680]   to verify the transaction wins the reward.
[01:36:33.680 --> 01:36:36.480]   - Yeah, that's how they choose this, whoever this is.
[01:36:36.480 --> 01:36:38.240]   - That sounds like, kind of like,
[01:36:38.240 --> 01:36:41.120]   you win the lottery and then get to do the work.
[01:36:41.120 --> 01:36:43.040]   Congratulations.
[01:36:43.040 --> 01:36:45.200]   You get to verify this.
[01:36:45.200 --> 01:36:47.320]   - But you get a percentage of the transaction.
[01:36:47.320 --> 01:36:49.080]   - That's right, but that's what you would get anyway.
[01:36:49.080 --> 01:36:51.280]   The difference is only one person's trying to do that
[01:36:51.280 --> 01:36:53.760]   instead of everybody trying to do that.
[01:36:53.760 --> 01:36:57.360]   They say they'll cut the use of energy by 99%.
[01:36:57.360 --> 01:36:59.000]   This has been something that Ethereum
[01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.840]   has been promising for years.
[01:37:01.840 --> 01:37:05.920]   It's finally, we think, gonna happen
[01:37:05.920 --> 01:37:08.360]   at September 15th.
[01:37:08.360 --> 01:37:13.200]   That's called The Merge, where Ethereum changes
[01:37:13.200 --> 01:37:16.720]   the fundamental transaction backbone
[01:37:16.720 --> 01:37:18.440]   for all Ethereum coins.
[01:37:18.440 --> 01:37:21.040]   Now, as you might imagine,
[01:37:21.040 --> 01:37:24.640]   A, this is technologically, incredibly complicated
[01:37:24.640 --> 01:37:25.760]   and error-prone.
[01:37:25.760 --> 01:37:27.840]   B, there is a large number.
[01:37:27.840 --> 01:37:29.720]   There are a large number of people who do not want this
[01:37:29.720 --> 01:37:33.400]   to happen 'cause they make money as crypto miners, right?
[01:37:33.400 --> 01:37:35.160]   So they're not happy about this.
[01:37:35.160 --> 01:37:39.240]   In fact, The Merge will probably also be simultaneous
[01:37:39.240 --> 01:37:43.920]   with a fork where some number of Ethereum users
[01:37:43.920 --> 01:37:48.360]   change to a proof of work form of Ethereum.
[01:37:48.360 --> 01:37:50.800]   And that's probably gonna happen as well.
[01:37:50.800 --> 01:37:55.680]   So, the article that you would just read from Becky,
[01:37:55.680 --> 01:37:56.880]   a very, very good piece,
[01:37:56.880 --> 01:37:59.320]   unusually good piece from The New York Times
[01:37:59.320 --> 01:38:02.760]   about The Merge written by David Yaffe Bellany.
[01:38:02.760 --> 01:38:05.960]   Very, very detailed, talks about the whole thing.
[01:38:05.960 --> 01:38:09.000]   I've been wanting to talk about this for some time
[01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.280]   because it's just a few weeks off.
[01:38:11.280 --> 01:38:15.200]   And it could be crazy.
[01:38:15.200 --> 01:38:17.160]   It's probably a good thing.
[01:38:17.160 --> 01:38:19.360]   Plenty of other cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin,
[01:38:19.360 --> 01:38:20.840]   will continue to use proof of work.
[01:38:20.840 --> 01:38:25.840]   So it's not gonna single-handedly solve the energy problem.
[01:38:25.840 --> 01:38:27.640]   - How do utilities feel about it?
[01:38:27.640 --> 01:38:31.160]   - Well, they find this to be inconvenient
[01:38:31.160 --> 01:38:32.520]   or is it a great profit center for them?
[01:38:32.520 --> 01:38:36.600]   - No, no, no, because the way these things work
[01:38:36.600 --> 01:38:39.760]   as more coins are generated, as more transactions happen,
[01:38:39.760 --> 01:38:41.480]   the difficulty of doing it goes up,
[01:38:41.480 --> 01:38:43.080]   which means they use more power.
[01:38:43.080 --> 01:38:46.320]   So nobody at this point who's trying to make money,
[01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:49.560]   Bitcoin mining is doing it off the normal grid
[01:38:49.560 --> 01:38:51.960]   because you won't make money.
[01:38:51.960 --> 01:38:53.400]   Electricity costs too much.
[01:38:53.400 --> 01:38:55.680]   So for a long time, all the Bitcoin miners
[01:38:55.680 --> 01:38:58.320]   were on hydroelectric dams in China
[01:38:58.320 --> 01:39:00.280]   and other places where the cost of electricity
[01:39:00.280 --> 01:39:01.520]   was effectively zero.
[01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:03.840]   China shut that down, by the way.
[01:39:03.840 --> 01:39:06.240]   That was a big blip in one of the reasons
[01:39:06.240 --> 01:39:09.560]   Bitcoin dropped so dramatically a couple of years ago.
[01:39:09.560 --> 01:39:11.840]   So I described this accurately.
[01:39:11.840 --> 01:39:12.680]   Anybody wanna-
[01:39:12.680 --> 01:39:13.520]   - I think so.
[01:39:13.520 --> 01:39:14.880]   I have a couple of questions though, follow up.
[01:39:14.880 --> 01:39:16.720]   So if I'm reading this right,
[01:39:16.720 --> 01:39:20.280]   there's $179 billion worth of Ether right now
[01:39:20.280 --> 01:39:22.560]   based on today's price.
[01:39:22.560 --> 01:39:26.520]   And so this shouldn't impact anyone's holdings.
[01:39:26.520 --> 01:39:27.760]   - No, no, no, no, not at all.
[01:39:27.760 --> 01:39:28.600]   Unless-
[01:39:30.760 --> 01:39:32.360]   - Unless it all goes to hell.
[01:39:32.360 --> 01:39:38.640]   I mean, there's also a cryptocurrency veteran quoted by,
[01:39:38.640 --> 01:39:40.960]   in the Times Chandler quote says,
[01:39:40.960 --> 01:39:45.080]   "It's flying the jet and changing the engine in the sky.
[01:39:45.080 --> 01:39:47.640]   "It's very difficult, it's very dangerous."
[01:39:47.640 --> 01:39:49.840]   So it could go belly up.
[01:39:49.840 --> 01:39:50.680]   I mean-
[01:39:50.680 --> 01:39:54.600]   - But even if this crashes in some way,
[01:39:54.600 --> 01:39:56.760]   it doesn't take down the database
[01:39:56.760 --> 01:39:58.720]   because obviously that's replicated,
[01:39:58.720 --> 01:40:01.680]   but the point is you couldn't maybe do some transactions
[01:40:01.680 --> 01:40:04.440]   until they figure out how to make this-
[01:40:04.440 --> 01:40:07.120]   - There are so many problems with cryptocurrency,
[01:40:07.120 --> 01:40:10.280]   including the amount of,
[01:40:10.280 --> 01:40:13.600]   the cost of the transaction and the amount of time.
[01:40:13.600 --> 01:40:16.880]   Ethereum gas fees, the cost of those transactions
[01:40:16.880 --> 01:40:18.920]   are wildly unpredictable.
[01:40:18.920 --> 01:40:21.600]   Often are more than the transaction.
[01:40:21.600 --> 01:40:24.640]   So if I gave you a hundredth of an ETH
[01:40:25.800 --> 01:40:28.720]   and it cost me $200 to give it to you,
[01:40:28.720 --> 01:40:32.000]   that would be a net loss overall.
[01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.120]   And we've seen this with NFTs
[01:40:34.120 --> 01:40:37.240]   where it's actually, it could be a money loser,
[01:40:37.240 --> 01:40:38.880]   or trying to get your money back,
[01:40:38.880 --> 01:40:40.880]   or there's all sorts of problems with the,
[01:40:40.880 --> 01:40:43.600]   remember where the Dow, one of the big Dows
[01:40:43.600 --> 01:40:48.600]   didn't go through, they were gonna buy the Constitution,
[01:40:48.600 --> 01:40:50.320]   and they failed,
[01:40:50.320 --> 01:40:51.760]   but then the cost of getting your money
[01:40:51.760 --> 01:40:55.240]   out of that Constitution Dow was higher
[01:40:55.240 --> 01:40:56.800]   than the amount of money you would get back
[01:40:56.800 --> 01:40:58.080]   'cause of gas fees.
[01:40:58.080 --> 01:41:00.640]   So this is a big problem.
[01:41:00.640 --> 01:41:02.440]   There are lots of problems with cryptocurrency.
[01:41:02.440 --> 01:41:05.560]   El Salvador, which left the American dollar
[01:41:05.560 --> 01:41:08.360]   as its currency and went to Bitcoin a year ago,
[01:41:08.360 --> 01:41:10.840]   is in deep financial do-do
[01:41:10.840 --> 01:41:13.160]   because they can't pay any bills anymore.
[01:41:13.160 --> 01:41:15.360]   Because there's-
[01:41:15.360 --> 01:41:17.880]   - Because of the transaction fees to do every transaction.
[01:41:17.880 --> 01:41:19.320]   It's like if you went to the bank and said,
[01:41:19.320 --> 01:41:23.960]   I want to withdraw $10 and withdrawing $10 costs you $20.
[01:41:23.960 --> 01:41:28.440]   - Right, furthermore, you don't know how long it's gonna take.
[01:41:28.440 --> 01:41:30.600]   And unless, and this is the weird thing, Bitcoin,
[01:41:30.600 --> 01:41:33.320]   if you pay enough, you can choose how much you're gonna pay
[01:41:33.320 --> 01:41:34.520]   for the transaction.
[01:41:34.520 --> 01:41:36.400]   The more you pay, the more miners will work on it,
[01:41:36.400 --> 01:41:37.920]   the more likely it'll go through.
[01:41:37.920 --> 01:41:39.880]   But if you say, no, I want the minimum,
[01:41:39.880 --> 01:41:43.640]   it may be days before the transaction goes through.
[01:41:43.640 --> 01:41:47.040]   All of this unpredictability is not, in my opinion,
[01:41:47.040 --> 01:41:49.120]   good for a monetary system.
[01:41:49.120 --> 01:41:51.880]   It's- - No, and the whole point of Ethereum
[01:41:51.880 --> 01:41:53.120]   is the thing that I like about it
[01:41:53.120 --> 01:41:56.080]   is that it's really tied into the smart contract concept.
[01:41:56.080 --> 01:41:58.480]   And so if you're thinking that you're gonna have
[01:41:58.480 --> 01:42:01.880]   automatic transactions, automated transactions
[01:42:01.880 --> 01:42:03.480]   that are done through the blockchain,
[01:42:03.480 --> 01:42:05.760]   but you don't know how much that transaction fee
[01:42:05.760 --> 01:42:08.560]   is gonna be, that seems like a fundamental problem
[01:42:08.560 --> 01:42:09.480]   with the concept.
[01:42:09.480 --> 01:42:13.240]   - Plus, look at the volatility in the value of the coin.
[01:42:13.240 --> 01:42:18.080]   You don't know what you buy a pizza one day for 50 bucks
[01:42:18.080 --> 01:42:21.600]   and it was $12 million the next day is not good.
[01:42:21.600 --> 01:42:24.280]   - Yeah, although Becky, I think the larger problem
[01:42:24.280 --> 01:42:26.680]   with smart contracts and the kind of thing
[01:42:26.680 --> 01:42:28.800]   that you were talking about there is that
[01:42:28.800 --> 01:42:32.080]   when we talk about people stealing things off the blockchain,
[01:42:32.080 --> 01:42:35.720]   people stealing other people's NFTs,
[01:42:35.720 --> 01:42:39.200]   the kind of fraud that goes on with DAOs,
[01:42:39.200 --> 01:42:43.840]   it's really reasonable to argue that if the smart contract
[01:42:43.840 --> 01:42:47.520]   is law, right, the smart contract is what governs
[01:42:47.520 --> 01:42:49.760]   what can and cannot be done.
[01:42:49.760 --> 01:42:52.400]   And so if the smart contract allows it
[01:42:52.400 --> 01:42:55.080]   and you've fraudulently exploited it,
[01:42:55.080 --> 01:42:57.440]   then that's technically sort of legal
[01:42:57.440 --> 01:42:59.200]   by the smart contract, right?
[01:42:59.200 --> 01:43:01.360]   So the bigger problem with smart contracts
[01:43:01.360 --> 01:43:03.120]   is that if you exploit them,
[01:43:03.120 --> 01:43:05.640]   then any exploitation is legal
[01:43:05.640 --> 01:43:07.760]   because the code is law, right?
[01:43:07.760 --> 01:43:11.200]   - Man, that's a whole new subset.
[01:43:11.200 --> 01:43:13.560]   - We have seen huge effect.
[01:43:13.560 --> 01:43:15.840]   All you have to do is go to the website,
[01:43:15.840 --> 01:43:17.800]   web three is going great.
[01:43:17.800 --> 01:43:19.440]   Have you seen this website?
[01:43:20.120 --> 01:43:21.360]   - No, what's this, Leo?
[01:43:21.360 --> 01:43:24.840]   - Web three is going just great is a chronicle
[01:43:24.840 --> 01:43:28.800]   of scams, rip-offs, fraud,
[01:43:28.800 --> 01:43:33.800]   and it is an endless story.
[01:43:33.800 --> 01:43:35.400]   And as you scrolling through it, by the way,
[01:43:35.400 --> 01:43:37.160]   look in the lower right-hand corner
[01:43:37.160 --> 01:43:41.720]   'cause that shows you how much the losses are right now.
[01:43:41.720 --> 01:43:44.560]   As I go, it gets higher and higher and higher.
[01:43:45.680 --> 01:43:50.680]   - I'm stunned that people still think this is a good idea,
[01:43:50.680 --> 01:43:53.720]   that they think web three's a good idea,
[01:43:53.720 --> 01:43:55.040]   they think NFTs are a good idea,
[01:43:55.040 --> 01:43:56.960]   that they think blockchain is a good idea.
[01:43:56.960 --> 01:43:59.680]   It is a technology that has some use
[01:43:59.680 --> 01:44:01.560]   at a distributed database.
[01:44:01.560 --> 01:44:03.920]   Yeah, it's not changing the world.
[01:44:03.920 --> 01:44:07.680]   And all it's really doing is relieving people
[01:44:07.680 --> 01:44:08.880]   of their money.
[01:44:08.880 --> 01:44:09.720]   So is that--
[01:44:09.720 --> 01:44:11.200]   - So Benedict Evans right?
[01:44:11.200 --> 01:44:12.680]   - Benedict Evans, right.
[01:44:12.680 --> 01:44:14.480]   - Really well on this on Twitter,
[01:44:14.480 --> 01:44:17.120]   which is he says the really interesting prospect,
[01:44:17.120 --> 01:44:19.280]   which is the whole point of web three,
[01:44:19.280 --> 01:44:21.920]   if you think about it from the sort of point of view
[01:44:21.920 --> 01:44:24.440]   of the evangelizers is it's distributed,
[01:44:24.440 --> 01:44:26.120]   it's away from the banking system,
[01:44:26.120 --> 01:44:32.680]   the community rights, the rules, the consumer is the owner,
[01:44:32.680 --> 01:44:34.760]   all those things are really important.
[01:44:34.760 --> 01:44:38.120]   On the other hand, if something goes wrong,
[01:44:38.120 --> 01:44:41.600]   then by design there is no one to complain to.
[01:44:41.600 --> 01:44:43.960]   And if you have your things stolen,
[01:44:43.960 --> 01:44:46.320]   or if you have your account hacked,
[01:44:46.320 --> 01:44:48.480]   then there is no one to go to,
[01:44:48.480 --> 01:44:52.720]   because specifically you own it, it was your fault.
[01:44:52.720 --> 01:44:56.000]   And the idea that to make web three
[01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.960]   and those kind of things useful to the general public,
[01:44:58.960 --> 01:45:01.920]   like if you want to make web three cryptocurrency,
[01:45:01.920 --> 01:45:05.560]   Ethereum merge, whatever useful to the general public,
[01:45:05.560 --> 01:45:08.040]   you have to have some degree of centralization,
[01:45:08.040 --> 01:45:09.640]   you have to have someone to complain to
[01:45:09.640 --> 01:45:10.880]   when something goes wrong.
[01:45:10.880 --> 01:45:13.080]   But that defeats the entire purpose
[01:45:13.080 --> 01:45:14.440]   of the web three experiment,
[01:45:14.440 --> 01:45:16.360]   which is to decentralize everything.
[01:45:16.360 --> 01:45:19.400]   So it's really going back to an era of like,
[01:45:19.400 --> 01:45:22.520]   you break it, you bought it, you screw it up,
[01:45:22.520 --> 01:45:25.840]   you lose your money, and there's nobody to complain to.
[01:45:25.840 --> 01:45:28.440]   - And of course, the people who have invested heavily
[01:45:28.440 --> 01:45:32.920]   in all of this require that somebody come along
[01:45:32.920 --> 01:45:36.520]   and give them real dollars for their investment.
[01:45:36.520 --> 01:45:38.920]   So there's a lot of fraud going on,
[01:45:38.920 --> 01:45:41.240]   there's a lot of cheerleading going on
[01:45:41.240 --> 01:45:44.920]   because people can't let this pyramid scheme collapse.
[01:45:44.920 --> 01:45:46.600]   And that's in my opinion what it is.
[01:45:46.600 --> 01:45:49.720]   So it was a bad idea to begin with.
[01:45:49.720 --> 01:45:56.040]   Good news, Ethereum won't burn the planet up anymore, maybe.
[01:45:56.040 --> 01:46:00.080]   But it's not, I think in the long run,
[01:46:00.080 --> 01:46:01.520]   this is not a good idea.
[01:46:01.520 --> 01:46:04.440]   - So do you think the NFT is based on creative works
[01:46:04.440 --> 01:46:07.040]   'cause being involved with the organizations
[01:46:07.040 --> 01:46:08.000]   I've involved with, of course,
[01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:11.960]   we're constantly barbed by brokers who want to sell us.
[01:46:11.960 --> 01:46:15.000]   You guys use our services and we'll do an NFT
[01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:19.080]   of a picture of Mars and we'll make you tons of money
[01:46:19.080 --> 01:46:20.480]   and we're not falling for it
[01:46:20.480 --> 01:46:21.600]   'cause only people making money,
[01:46:21.600 --> 01:46:22.640]   I suspect of the brokers.
[01:46:22.640 --> 01:46:24.920]   But do you think this whole NFT is based
[01:46:24.920 --> 01:46:27.920]   on kind of spurious creative works things?
[01:46:27.920 --> 01:46:29.800]   - Well, I think it started because there were a lot
[01:46:29.800 --> 01:46:33.600]   of Bitcoin bros who needed to make,
[01:46:33.600 --> 01:46:34.440]   laundry their money.
[01:46:34.440 --> 01:46:36.880]   But I think the real problem right now is
[01:46:36.880 --> 01:46:39.680]   that the people who are approaching you are not,
[01:46:39.680 --> 01:46:41.960]   are the people who are minting the NFTs
[01:46:41.960 --> 01:46:44.280]   and just like Levi's during the gold rush,
[01:46:44.280 --> 01:46:46.880]   they made all the money, so don't agree, it's not.
[01:46:46.880 --> 01:46:49.200]   - You make money selling the pickax is not the gold, right?
[01:46:49.200 --> 01:46:50.640]   - I know that, sure they know how to do that.
[01:46:50.640 --> 01:46:51.920]   They're just advising.
[01:46:51.920 --> 01:46:53.720]   - So people are approaching you about this
[01:46:53.720 --> 01:46:55.160]   are the ones who are staying to make money.
[01:46:55.160 --> 01:46:56.000]   - Yeah.
[01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:56.840]   - Those kind of thought.
[01:46:56.840 --> 01:46:58.560]   - And also I wouldn't wanna, you know,
[01:46:58.560 --> 01:47:01.340]   we've often thought about doing that ourselves.
[01:47:01.340 --> 01:47:06.440]   I wouldn't wanna capitalize on our audience
[01:47:06.440 --> 01:47:07.520]   taking their money.
[01:47:07.520 --> 01:47:11.600]   If they buy, a lot of people buy NFTs just wanna support
[01:47:11.600 --> 01:47:13.240]   the artists, that's great.
[01:47:13.240 --> 01:47:14.640]   You could just donate instead.
[01:47:14.640 --> 01:47:15.880]   - That's a patriot for, right?
[01:47:15.880 --> 01:47:19.200]   - Yeah, but if I think a lot of people buy NFTs,
[01:47:19.200 --> 01:47:23.040]   NFTs buy it as a speculative vehicle as a security
[01:47:23.040 --> 01:47:25.720]   that they're gonna sell back at some point and make money on
[01:47:25.720 --> 01:47:27.960]   and that's something that bothers me.
[01:47:27.960 --> 01:47:32.760]   We are really close to the SEC saying
[01:47:32.760 --> 01:47:35.280]   that these are securities and that's-
[01:47:35.280 --> 01:47:37.280]   - That's always what they've been, right?
[01:47:37.280 --> 01:47:38.120]   - Yes.
[01:47:38.120 --> 01:47:41.240]   - And your good friend and mine, Jason Calicanis,
[01:47:41.240 --> 01:47:44.680]   harps on about this on Twitter a lot about the fact
[01:47:44.680 --> 01:47:48.320]   that crypto currency NFTs, they're securities,
[01:47:48.320 --> 01:47:50.880]   they're just not currently recognized as such, right?
[01:47:50.880 --> 01:47:53.120]   - And if they are, then the SEC regulates it.
[01:47:53.120 --> 01:47:57.040]   There are many who are true believers in crypto
[01:47:57.040 --> 01:47:58.560]   who say, yes, we need that.
[01:47:58.560 --> 01:47:59.640]   We need some regulation.
[01:47:59.640 --> 01:48:02.640]   We need to understand what the rules are at least
[01:48:02.640 --> 01:48:03.880]   so we can go forward.
[01:48:05.080 --> 01:48:07.520]   But there are many who fear that as well.
[01:48:07.520 --> 01:48:10.240]   And regulation usually means taxation.
[01:48:10.240 --> 01:48:11.760]   Some people don't like that idea.
[01:48:11.760 --> 01:48:14.760]   The whole idea of some of this is anonymity, right?
[01:48:14.760 --> 01:48:16.480]   But as we've learned again and again,
[01:48:16.480 --> 01:48:19.160]   you're not really anonymous.
[01:48:19.160 --> 01:48:22.440]   In fact, yeah, ever.
[01:48:22.440 --> 01:48:23.480]   Yeah, maybe, yeah.
[01:48:23.480 --> 01:48:24.320]   - Well, that's too bad.
[01:48:24.320 --> 01:48:25.920]   I wanted you in the NFT of my Mars flag
[01:48:25.920 --> 01:48:28.320]   that I took up to the Arctic, but.
[01:48:28.320 --> 01:48:29.360]   - Let me see.
[01:48:29.360 --> 01:48:30.800]   Oh, this is the flag you designed.
[01:48:30.800 --> 01:48:32.320]   Is that on thespace.com?
[01:48:32.320 --> 01:48:34.360]   - Well, design quote unquote.
[01:48:34.360 --> 01:48:35.200]   - Yeah.
[01:48:35.200 --> 01:48:38.720]   So tell me about the flag story.
[01:48:38.720 --> 01:48:41.760]   Every season, is there a new flag?
[01:48:41.760 --> 01:48:46.760]   - So this was based on the notion that the polar explorers
[01:48:46.760 --> 01:48:51.320]   of the heroic era all took along their battle flags, right?
[01:48:51.320 --> 01:48:53.960]   So Shackleton had his family crest
[01:48:53.960 --> 01:48:58.040]   and Robert Scott, who was not a very good leader.
[01:48:58.040 --> 01:49:00.520]   Was he trudged his men into death in oblivion,
[01:49:00.520 --> 01:49:04.080]   had his family crest and then they'd have
[01:49:04.080 --> 01:49:05.440]   a larger, so that, what you're seeing,
[01:49:05.440 --> 01:49:09.720]   there's a picture of Pascal who runs the place and owns it,
[01:49:09.720 --> 01:49:14.040]   putting up a flag which I had made for him
[01:49:14.040 --> 01:49:19.040]   of the first long Shackleton expedition that was 1907
[01:49:19.040 --> 01:49:21.520]   to try and reach his health pole.
[01:49:21.520 --> 01:49:23.000]   When that Shackleton's family crest
[01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:26.040]   done kind of a standard bearing background or something.
[01:49:26.040 --> 01:49:27.720]   And I thought, well, we should have something like that.
[01:49:27.720 --> 01:49:30.800]   So I, there was one on the whole internet,
[01:49:30.800 --> 01:49:33.080]   there was one image of that Shackleton flag
[01:49:33.080 --> 01:49:34.280]   from the original thing.
[01:49:34.280 --> 01:49:36.480]   So I had a graphic artist redo it for me
[01:49:36.480 --> 01:49:38.880]   and then I thought, well, what if something for me?
[01:49:38.880 --> 01:49:41.600]   So I decided to have the Martian war machines
[01:49:41.600 --> 01:49:43.880]   taking out the planet Earth with Mars rising in the background.
[01:49:43.880 --> 01:49:46.000]   - This is from H.G. Wells, War of the World.
[01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:47.200]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:49:47.200 --> 01:49:48.480]   So that's, we left it up there.
[01:49:48.480 --> 01:49:50.920]   So we're gonna go back next year and see
[01:49:50.920 --> 01:49:52.240]   how many tatters are left.
[01:49:52.240 --> 01:49:53.640]   Does it, does it survive?
[01:49:53.640 --> 01:49:54.880]   - The winter pretty winter.
[01:49:54.880 --> 01:49:56.040]   - No, it's brutal up there.
[01:49:56.040 --> 01:49:57.480]   It's brutal enough in the summer.
[01:49:57.480 --> 01:49:59.480]   We were getting 50 mile an hour gusts
[01:49:59.480 --> 01:50:02.280]   and temperatures with chill down the 20s.
[01:50:02.280 --> 01:50:04.200]   Which, you know, there's a lot of people in Minnesota
[01:50:04.200 --> 01:50:06.760]   that would say, oh, the 20s, hey, it's not so bad.
[01:50:06.760 --> 01:50:10.680]   But up there with the grit and the constant UV
[01:50:10.680 --> 01:50:12.760]   'cause there's a, now there's no zone hole up there
[01:50:12.760 --> 01:50:15.480]   and so forth, it's a whole different deal.
[01:50:15.480 --> 01:50:17.280]   So I'm sorry, I didn't mean to pull this back.
[01:50:17.280 --> 01:50:19.360]   - You did get burned a little bit.
[01:50:19.360 --> 01:50:20.840]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:50:20.840 --> 01:50:21.680]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:50:21.680 --> 01:50:22.520]   - A little bit, yeah.
[01:50:22.520 --> 01:50:23.360]   - And we tried to be careful.
[01:50:23.360 --> 01:50:24.960]   - I didn't realize there was a hole there.
[01:50:24.960 --> 01:50:25.800]   - Yeah.
[01:50:25.800 --> 01:50:26.640]   - So that means you're really getting--
[01:50:26.640 --> 01:50:29.200]   - Come to the goes and that's on top of the ice melting
[01:50:29.200 --> 01:50:30.720]   and now the polar bears are more hungry
[01:50:30.720 --> 01:50:32.480]   so you gotta constantly be looking out for them
[01:50:32.480 --> 01:50:34.280]   'cause they're prowling around saying,
[01:50:34.280 --> 01:50:36.080]   hey, I haven't had a seal to eat for a week.
[01:50:36.080 --> 01:50:38.520]   You look like five seals, I'll eat you.
[01:50:38.520 --> 01:50:41.520]   So you have to carry a shotgun everywhere you go.
[01:50:41.520 --> 01:50:42.360]   Yeah, it's pretty wild.
[01:50:42.360 --> 01:50:44.440]   - What is, what kind of reporting do you do
[01:50:44.440 --> 01:50:45.400]   on cryptocurrency?
[01:50:45.400 --> 01:50:48.640]   I'm sure that people are very interested in this.
[01:50:48.640 --> 01:50:49.960]   - Zip non-zero.
[01:50:49.960 --> 01:50:53.960]   - Is that your idea or ABC's idea?
[01:50:53.960 --> 01:50:54.960]   - A little bit of both.
[01:50:54.960 --> 01:50:58.040]   I'm much more in the everyday practical news
[01:50:58.040 --> 01:50:59.640]   you can use consumer.
[01:50:59.640 --> 01:51:00.480]   - Yeah.
[01:51:00.480 --> 01:51:02.240]   - So I'm really interested in Venmo.
[01:51:02.240 --> 01:51:06.640]   I'm, the Cash App story this week is crazy to me
[01:51:06.640 --> 01:51:11.640]   that you're seeing people having their accounts drained
[01:51:11.640 --> 01:51:14.520]   and those are the kind of stories
[01:51:14.520 --> 01:51:15.720]   that really catch my attention,
[01:51:15.720 --> 01:51:18.000]   the ones that are much more in the hands of the everyday user.
[01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:22.160]   And it makes me super nervous to talk about crypto
[01:51:22.160 --> 01:51:24.960]   at the broad, broad broadcasting levels
[01:51:24.960 --> 01:51:26.960]   in terms of try this.
[01:51:26.960 --> 01:51:29.280]   - This is actually, we've been kind of getting into this
[01:51:29.280 --> 01:51:34.280]   on the radio show because there's a well-known radio guy,
[01:51:34.280 --> 01:51:39.560]   finance guy who says,
[01:51:39.560 --> 01:51:44.560]   don't use Venmo Cash App and really don't use Zell.
[01:51:44.560 --> 01:51:45.960]   They're dangerous.
[01:51:45.960 --> 01:51:50.760]   And I'm saying, well, I use them all the time.
[01:51:50.760 --> 01:51:55.360]   They're no more dangerous than your bank or cash.
[01:51:55.360 --> 01:51:57.360]   But their point is, and I guess this is true,
[01:51:57.360 --> 01:51:59.520]   probably even you're reporting your audience,
[01:51:59.520 --> 01:52:01.880]   people don't understand that they're tied directly
[01:52:01.880 --> 01:52:03.800]   to your bank account.
[01:52:03.800 --> 01:52:05.200]   - Tied directly to your bank account
[01:52:05.200 --> 01:52:07.960]   and you have far less recourse if something goes wrong.
[01:52:07.960 --> 01:52:10.800]   - But as you, if I took 100 bucks out of the bank
[01:52:10.800 --> 01:52:14.040]   and gave it to you, it's not the bank's responsibility
[01:52:14.040 --> 01:52:15.200]   to make it good.
[01:52:15.200 --> 01:52:17.200]   If I get scammed that way, it's not.
[01:52:17.200 --> 01:52:19.640]   So people somehow think that if you use Zell
[01:52:19.640 --> 01:52:22.040]   or Cash App or Venmo and get scammed,
[01:52:22.040 --> 01:52:25.320]   it's the responsibility of the bank.
[01:52:25.320 --> 01:52:27.240]   - But is it the difference between,
[01:52:27.240 --> 01:52:29.800]   if you use a credit card, if you get scammed,
[01:52:29.800 --> 01:52:32.400]   your credit card will reimburse you, right?
[01:52:32.400 --> 01:52:33.240]   That's part of the-
[01:52:33.240 --> 01:52:35.080]   - They had to do that 'cause no one would have-
[01:52:35.080 --> 01:52:36.920]   - No one would have used credit cards, but I don't-
[01:52:36.920 --> 01:52:38.840]   - Yeah, so it's the difference between doing
[01:52:38.840 --> 01:52:42.600]   a credit card transaction where you're gonna get reimbursed
[01:52:42.600 --> 01:52:45.520]   if you get scammed, a direct bank transaction
[01:52:45.520 --> 01:52:47.800]   where you're not going to,
[01:52:47.800 --> 01:52:50.400]   which I guess is the difference between going to a merchant
[01:52:50.400 --> 01:52:52.280]   and giving them cash or credit, right?
[01:52:52.280 --> 01:52:54.240]   - Well, and I was really saying no,
[01:52:54.240 --> 01:52:56.080]   Clark Howard, Clark Howard's the guy.
[01:52:56.080 --> 01:52:58.320]   Clark Howard's wrong and Zell is fine, go ahead.
[01:52:58.320 --> 01:52:59.320]   In fact, somebody called the radio show,
[01:52:59.320 --> 01:53:02.640]   I said no, 'cause she'd heard this, I said no, it's fine.
[01:53:02.640 --> 01:53:06.160]   But it's like Cash, if don't give it to somebody
[01:53:06.160 --> 01:53:08.120]   you don't know, not a matter of-
[01:53:08.120 --> 01:53:09.120]   - But the hacks are-
[01:53:09.120 --> 01:53:10.560]   - Well, the hacks are different.
[01:53:10.560 --> 01:53:11.400]   The hacks are different.
[01:53:11.400 --> 01:53:13.440]   Actually, I wanna talk about the hacks in a second,
[01:53:13.440 --> 01:53:17.220]   but separate from the hacks, which are an issue,
[01:53:17.220 --> 01:53:20.560]   just be careful 'cause it's like Cash
[01:53:20.560 --> 01:53:21.880]   and you're not gonna get made whole
[01:53:21.880 --> 01:53:23.320]   if you give it to somebody.
[01:53:23.320 --> 01:53:25.320]   And the reason I mention this, you know, Jennifer,
[01:53:25.320 --> 01:53:28.280]   very well my ex-wife, the mother of my children.
[01:53:28.280 --> 01:53:29.920]   - Bought me a mini skirt once.
[01:53:29.920 --> 01:53:31.080]   - Did she really?
[01:53:31.080 --> 01:53:33.200]   - Yeah, she bought me a great mini skirt once
[01:53:33.200 --> 01:53:35.160]   at the Outlets in Petaluma.
[01:53:35.160 --> 01:53:36.280]   It was so sweet.
[01:53:36.280 --> 01:53:39.440]   - Just for no reason said here's a mini skirt.
[01:53:39.440 --> 01:53:40.840]   - She said she was shopping, she saw it
[01:53:40.840 --> 01:53:41.800]   and she thought I'd like it.
[01:53:41.800 --> 01:53:43.040]   It was the cutest thing.
[01:53:43.040 --> 01:53:45.520]   - Wow, I don't think I ever saw you in it,
[01:53:45.520 --> 01:53:47.440]   but that's probably good for the best.
[01:53:47.440 --> 01:53:49.480]   - Anyways, I totally-
[01:53:49.480 --> 01:53:50.320]   - I love Jennifer.
[01:53:50.320 --> 01:53:51.160]   - I love Jennifer.
[01:53:51.160 --> 01:53:52.000]   - So sorry.
[01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:52.840]   - I'm so sorry.
[01:53:52.840 --> 01:53:54.280]   - We just were going to things
[01:53:54.280 --> 01:53:55.880]   that the little port family has bought
[01:53:55.880 --> 01:53:57.760]   'cause Leo bought me a really nice bottle
[01:53:57.760 --> 01:53:59.000]   of reds in Van der Waals.
[01:53:59.000 --> 01:53:59.840]   - Oh, wow.
[01:53:59.840 --> 01:54:01.160]   - Oh, nice.
[01:54:01.160 --> 01:54:03.760]   - I've ever since bought Petaluma's infantel
[01:54:03.760 --> 01:54:06.480]   whenever I'm in a respectable London eatery.
[01:54:06.480 --> 01:54:07.320]   - Anyway, I would-
[01:54:07.320 --> 01:54:09.480]   - But did he buy you a lemon drop?
[01:54:09.480 --> 01:54:10.520]   - Oh, that was a mistake.
[01:54:10.520 --> 01:54:11.800]   - That's his drink of choice.
[01:54:11.800 --> 01:54:12.920]   - That was a big mistake.
[01:54:12.920 --> 01:54:14.640]   I've stopped with the lemon drops.
[01:54:14.640 --> 01:54:19.280]   Too many horrible things have happened at my home.
[01:54:19.280 --> 01:54:21.080]   - That we will not go into.
[01:54:21.080 --> 01:54:22.720]   (laughing)
[01:54:22.720 --> 01:54:26.160]   - But which, Becky, I will mention
[01:54:26.160 --> 01:54:28.120]   if I'm required to do your eulogy,
[01:54:28.120 --> 01:54:29.160]   I will bring that up.
[01:54:29.160 --> 01:54:31.120]   I'm just gonna tell you right now,
[01:54:31.120 --> 01:54:33.680]   I'm sure you will outlive me by hundreds of years,
[01:54:33.680 --> 01:54:37.080]   but if for some reason you get lost on a kayak,
[01:54:37.080 --> 01:54:39.520]   you disappear on a stand-up paddleboard,
[01:54:39.520 --> 01:54:41.640]   I'm going to tell this-
[01:54:41.640 --> 01:54:42.480]   - Okay.
[01:54:42.480 --> 01:54:43.320]   - Well, I have many stories.
[01:54:43.320 --> 01:54:44.640]   I have so many stories.
[01:54:44.640 --> 01:54:46.800]   I probably, I'll have to pick and choose.
[01:54:46.800 --> 01:54:47.880]   (laughing)
[01:54:47.880 --> 01:54:51.040]   - Now, 20 minutes, as I'm taking off to dog.
[01:54:51.040 --> 01:54:54.000]   None of them reflecting poorly on Becky, I might add.
[01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.840]   All right, as we're launching your little finger into space,
[01:54:56.840 --> 01:54:59.680]   I'll be telling you about the mini skirt, did you?
[01:54:59.680 --> 01:55:02.080]   - This girl like to have some F-U-N-
[01:55:02.080 --> 01:55:04.240]   - Jennifer and I both used Zelda
[01:55:04.240 --> 01:55:05.920]   to send money to her kids and stuff,
[01:55:05.920 --> 01:55:07.360]   but she got scammed,
[01:55:07.360 --> 01:55:09.600]   and once you get scammed out of money on Zell,
[01:55:09.600 --> 01:55:12.160]   you're right, you ain't getting back.
[01:55:12.160 --> 01:55:14.400]   So you really have to treat it.
[01:55:14.400 --> 01:55:16.000]   And she's a smart person,
[01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:19.800]   so that really opened my eyes as to how easy it is
[01:55:19.800 --> 01:55:22.760]   to say, "Oh, I need to send this person money."
[01:55:22.760 --> 01:55:24.760]   I've got, they said, "Zell, no problem.
[01:55:24.760 --> 01:55:26.920]   "I've been using this to send money to our kids.
[01:55:26.920 --> 01:55:27.960]   "I'll just send them that money."
[01:55:27.960 --> 01:55:29.720]   And that's it, it's gone.
[01:55:29.720 --> 01:55:31.000]   - So I know it's a different process,
[01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:33.280]   but is PayPal a step safer than that?
[01:55:33.280 --> 01:55:34.280]   - Same thing, no, same thing.
[01:55:34.280 --> 01:55:35.120]   - Same issue.
[01:55:35.120 --> 01:55:37.440]   - Venmo is PayPal, so it's the same thing.
[01:55:37.440 --> 01:55:41.640]   And I think the only reason credit cards
[01:55:41.640 --> 01:55:45.200]   back up your stupidity is because no one would have used them
[01:55:45.200 --> 01:55:46.040]   in the early days,
[01:55:46.040 --> 01:55:48.280]   and they so they kind of got in the habit of it.
[01:55:48.280 --> 01:55:52.400]   I wish we'd made Zell and Cash to App and all that,
[01:55:52.400 --> 01:55:53.960]   do the same, but we didn't.
[01:55:53.960 --> 01:55:55.080]   Apple Pay is the same.
[01:55:55.080 --> 01:55:58.000]   Anything you're sending money from your bank account,
[01:55:58.000 --> 01:55:58.840]   you're at risk.
[01:55:58.840 --> 01:56:01.520]   Now, the hacks are a big problem,
[01:56:01.520 --> 01:56:05.080]   because if I do hack your account,
[01:56:05.080 --> 01:56:05.960]   I got it all.
[01:56:05.960 --> 01:56:07.520]   I got everything that's in your bank account.
[01:56:07.520 --> 01:56:09.880]   And again, with no recourse.
[01:56:09.880 --> 01:56:11.440]   So you need to use a good password,
[01:56:11.440 --> 01:56:13.800]   all the same things you always do.
[01:56:13.800 --> 01:56:15.920]   - So after this Cash App story came up,
[01:56:15.920 --> 01:56:19.520]   basically the story was that multiple people
[01:56:19.520 --> 01:56:20.800]   are reporting on social,
[01:56:20.800 --> 01:56:22.600]   that their accounts have been drained
[01:56:22.600 --> 01:56:25.680]   when they haven't made any payments to anyone.
[01:56:25.680 --> 01:56:29.080]   And there are reports of passwords,
[01:56:29.080 --> 01:56:31.200]   of user account names,
[01:56:31.200 --> 01:56:33.560]   and information associated with the accounts
[01:56:33.560 --> 01:56:35.440]   being listed on the dark web,
[01:56:35.440 --> 01:56:37.400]   with people, some people saying,
[01:56:37.400 --> 01:56:38.560]   "That may or may not be good data."
[01:56:38.560 --> 01:56:41.440]   Other people saying, "Yeah, I got a lot of money out of this."
[01:56:41.440 --> 01:56:43.520]   Reviewers on the dark web, right.
[01:56:43.520 --> 01:56:46.160]   But what's interesting is I signed up
[01:56:46.160 --> 01:56:47.760]   for the Cash App this morning,
[01:56:47.760 --> 01:56:51.440]   and you don't put a password in.
[01:56:51.440 --> 01:56:56.440]   It uses your email or your phone number,
[01:56:56.440 --> 01:57:00.200]   but the security by default is pretty lean.
[01:57:00.200 --> 01:57:02.360]   There's no pin number turned on.
[01:57:02.360 --> 01:57:03.760]   You have to go into the settings
[01:57:03.760 --> 01:57:06.040]   and turn the pin number on,
[01:57:06.040 --> 01:57:10.000]   and there's no authenticator turned on by default.
[01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:14.320]   So I can think of a bunch of scams,
[01:57:14.320 --> 01:57:15.840]   like the Google Voice scams,
[01:57:15.840 --> 01:57:16.920]   I don't know if you've heard about those,
[01:57:16.920 --> 01:57:19.480]   where people can basically get access to your phone number,
[01:57:19.480 --> 01:57:23.200]   and therefore take over your two factor authentication,
[01:57:23.200 --> 01:57:25.080]   where this could be a real problem,
[01:57:25.080 --> 01:57:27.720]   and this is the kind of stuff that makes me very nervous,
[01:57:27.720 --> 01:57:29.440]   and then I end up reporting on a lot.
[01:57:29.440 --> 01:57:31.560]   - As you should, and I have to say,
[01:57:31.560 --> 01:57:34.080]   I have amended my recommendation.
[01:57:34.080 --> 01:57:35.680]   It's not that they're inherently unsafe,
[01:57:35.680 --> 01:57:39.760]   although the Cash App does sound like it's inherently unsafe,
[01:57:39.760 --> 01:57:41.280]   but the risk is so much higher
[01:57:41.280 --> 01:57:43.320]   because it's tied to your bank account,
[01:57:43.320 --> 01:57:45.040]   and because there's no recourse,
[01:57:45.040 --> 01:57:47.720]   that it's probably best not to use these,
[01:57:47.720 --> 01:57:50.640]   I guess, right?
[01:57:50.640 --> 01:57:51.480]   - Well, I think that--
[01:57:51.480 --> 01:57:52.520]   - It doesn't sound like you should use Cash,
[01:57:52.520 --> 01:57:53.960]   I use Cash App all the time.
[01:57:53.960 --> 01:57:56.280]   That's Jack Dorsey's company, that's blog.
[01:57:56.280 --> 01:57:59.840]   - It is, I just wouldn't assume that it's secure by default,
[01:57:59.840 --> 01:58:02.400]   and that's a lot to ask for the average consumer.
[01:58:02.400 --> 01:58:04.440]   That would be my request,
[01:58:04.440 --> 01:58:06.960]   is that there was a lot more default security,
[01:58:06.960 --> 01:58:09.280]   two-factor authentication, and beyond,
[01:58:09.280 --> 01:58:11.800]   and a pin number to actually access the thing.
[01:58:11.800 --> 01:58:14.480]   - It should have all of those secure things,
[01:58:14.480 --> 01:58:16.160]   but then it's harder to use, right?
[01:58:16.160 --> 01:58:17.600]   And they want you to use it, so--
[01:58:17.600 --> 01:58:19.440]   - So what's the big picture solution to this,
[01:58:19.440 --> 01:58:21.280]   other than DNA sampling or something?
[01:58:21.280 --> 01:58:23.320]   I mean, well, this is actually,
[01:58:23.320 --> 01:58:26.880]   this is of such a fundamental thing in technology
[01:58:26.880 --> 01:58:28.440]   is the idea of authentication.
[01:58:28.440 --> 01:58:30.840]   How do you, even prior to technology,
[01:58:30.840 --> 01:58:32.840]   how do you prove you are who you are?
[01:58:32.840 --> 01:58:33.960]   That's where we have passwords,
[01:58:33.960 --> 01:58:34.880]   this is where we have pins,
[01:58:34.880 --> 01:58:35.840]   that we have all these things.
[01:58:35.840 --> 01:58:38.360]   And I think that there are gonna be better ways to do this.
[01:58:38.360 --> 01:58:41.880]   This FIDO2 pass keys solution
[01:58:41.880 --> 01:58:42.920]   that we've been talking about,
[01:58:42.920 --> 01:58:46.720]   the Microsoft, Google, and Apple now are actively supporting.
[01:58:46.720 --> 01:58:50.240]   I think that's gonna be an improvement over passwords.
[01:58:50.240 --> 01:58:52.200]   The problem is there's always a trade-off,
[01:58:52.200 --> 01:58:54.000]   or it seems like almost always a trade-off
[01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:56.840]   between security and convenience.
[01:58:56.840 --> 01:58:59.000]   And most companies who are trying to do business with you
[01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:00.680]   are gonna err on the side of convenience,
[01:59:00.680 --> 01:59:02.160]   'cause they want you to do business.
[01:59:02.160 --> 01:59:03.560]   So I think that's part of the problem.
[01:59:03.560 --> 01:59:08.320]   I'm sure Cash App knows how to make itself 100% secure,
[01:59:08.320 --> 01:59:10.480]   but they fear it'll be too hard to use.
[01:59:10.480 --> 01:59:12.280]   - I also think some of the big players
[01:59:12.280 --> 01:59:16.160]   will absorb cash transfers into their ecosystems
[01:59:16.160 --> 01:59:19.800]   because their authentication is more robust in their devices.
[01:59:19.800 --> 01:59:22.280]   So take Apple for example.
[01:59:22.280 --> 01:59:24.440]   If I'm gonna text money to my kids,
[01:59:24.440 --> 01:59:27.640]   I have to use facial recognition to text it
[01:59:27.640 --> 01:59:29.440]   from my phone to theirs,
[01:59:29.440 --> 01:59:32.720]   but they've got a password on the phone, so do I,
[01:59:32.720 --> 01:59:35.560]   and you have to double up with some sort of pin
[01:59:35.560 --> 01:59:37.360]   or facial recognition to send the money.
[01:59:37.360 --> 01:59:39.080]   So that's built into the ecosystem,
[01:59:39.080 --> 01:59:42.120]   and I can see that being a strong case for security
[01:59:42.120 --> 01:59:43.920]   by a device, security built in on,
[01:59:43.920 --> 01:59:45.360]   that's like a three-factor.
[01:59:45.360 --> 01:59:47.120]   - And that's what PAST Keys is all about,
[01:59:47.120 --> 01:59:49.720]   is that your device, because it's using biometrics,
[01:59:49.720 --> 01:59:51.960]   fingerprint or face, is really,
[01:59:51.960 --> 01:59:56.120]   can somewhat be trusted to be a proof that you are,
[01:59:56.120 --> 01:59:56.960]   who you say you are,
[01:59:56.960 --> 01:59:59.800]   as long as you're using those biometrics anyway.
[01:59:59.800 --> 02:00:02.680]   - I mean, is the definition of security versus convenience?
[02:00:02.680 --> 02:00:04.800]   - Yes, exactly.
[02:00:04.800 --> 02:00:06.920]   But it is more convenient if you're using touch ID
[02:00:06.920 --> 02:00:10.360]   or face ID on a device.
[02:00:10.360 --> 02:00:11.800]   That's pretty convenient.
[02:00:11.800 --> 02:00:13.800]   That's not a password, so that's why--
[02:00:13.800 --> 02:00:15.680]   - And think about something like Mint,
[02:00:15.680 --> 02:00:17.560]   which is tied to all my accounts,
[02:00:17.560 --> 02:00:20.200]   and that has not only is it on my device,
[02:00:20.200 --> 02:00:22.520]   and I have to use facial recognition to open it up,
[02:00:22.520 --> 02:00:24.160]   but then when I open the app itself,
[02:00:24.160 --> 02:00:26.880]   it acts for a secondary facial check.
[02:00:26.880 --> 02:00:28.800]   So that makes a lot of sense to me.
[02:00:28.800 --> 02:00:29.800]   It doesn't help on the web,
[02:00:29.800 --> 02:00:31.840]   but in terms of on my browser or my computer,
[02:00:31.840 --> 02:00:34.200]   but I think there's a lot to be said for that.
[02:00:34.200 --> 02:00:35.720]   - That's what Pascis does, though,
[02:00:35.720 --> 02:00:38.280]   because now when you're on your computer on a site,
[02:00:38.280 --> 02:00:41.240]   it'll say, okay, open your phone, log in,
[02:00:41.240 --> 02:00:45.320]   and so it is tying that device with biometrics to websites.
[02:00:45.320 --> 02:00:49.560]   - Do you guys have two-factor authentication
[02:00:49.560 --> 02:00:53.000]   for just general credit card transactions on the web?
[02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:54.960]   Because that's one thing that's become increasingly
[02:00:54.960 --> 02:00:58.600]   normalized over here, which is you can be on Amazon,
[02:00:58.600 --> 02:01:01.240]   you can be on any old website in the world.
[02:01:01.240 --> 02:01:02.960]   You put your credit card details in,
[02:01:02.960 --> 02:01:07.360]   and it will insist on texting you a six-digit code.
[02:01:07.360 --> 02:01:08.440]   - No, we don't do that here.
[02:01:08.440 --> 02:01:12.640]   We have the number on the back of your credit card.
[02:01:12.640 --> 02:01:14.960]   - Oh, which ever is written down anyway.
[02:01:14.960 --> 02:01:15.800]   (laughing)
[02:01:15.800 --> 02:01:17.920]   I mean, it never fails to amaze me.
[02:01:17.920 --> 02:01:22.040]   The somebody once joked that the sure-fire way
[02:01:22.040 --> 02:01:25.160]   to create a billion-dollar American startup
[02:01:25.160 --> 02:01:29.440]   is to take European or British bank technology
[02:01:29.440 --> 02:01:32.240]   from 10 years ago and bring it to America.
[02:01:32.240 --> 02:01:33.280]   Because it is so poor.
[02:01:33.280 --> 02:01:36.240]   So one of the things that we do over here is
[02:01:36.240 --> 02:01:39.560]   if you use your card anywhere that you haven't used it
[02:01:39.560 --> 02:01:41.760]   in the last two or three days online,
[02:01:41.760 --> 02:01:47.880]   it will 100% ask you to put in your phone number.
[02:01:47.880 --> 02:01:50.120]   And if it's the phone number that they have matched
[02:01:50.120 --> 02:01:52.960]   on your account at your credit card thing,
[02:01:52.960 --> 02:01:55.600]   they will send you a text message with a six-digit code
[02:01:55.600 --> 02:01:59.280]   and you've got to put your six-digit code into the web app
[02:01:59.280 --> 02:02:02.080]   or the iPhone app or whatever it is you're using
[02:02:02.080 --> 02:02:04.000]   in order to authenticate the transaction.
[02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:07.680]   So 2FA has just become almost absolutely standard
[02:02:07.680 --> 02:02:09.680]   for credit card transactions over here.
[02:02:09.680 --> 02:02:10.560]   - Yeah.
[02:02:10.560 --> 02:02:13.200]   - Well, you didn't just show your credit card number, right?
[02:02:13.200 --> 02:02:14.680]   (laughing)
[02:02:14.680 --> 02:02:16.840]   - 4169-8.
[02:02:16.840 --> 02:02:19.560]   - Just don't show the three-digit code on the back.
[02:02:19.560 --> 02:02:21.400]   Okay, please, I beg of you.
[02:02:21.400 --> 02:02:22.240]   We're gonna take a little break.
[02:02:22.240 --> 02:02:24.280]   We have to, we're way behind.
[02:02:24.280 --> 02:02:27.080]   The problem is when I have a panel like this,
[02:02:27.080 --> 02:02:30.280]   it's just hard to stay on, I just have so much fun.
[02:02:30.280 --> 02:02:34.320]   It's so nice having Becky Worley here from ABC.
[02:02:34.320 --> 02:02:35.720]   No, that's not Becky.
[02:02:35.720 --> 02:02:36.560]   That's Becky.
[02:02:36.560 --> 02:02:38.160]   (laughing)
[02:02:38.160 --> 02:02:39.600]   Becky has not yet grown to be here.
[02:02:39.600 --> 02:02:40.440]   - My facial hair.
[02:02:40.440 --> 02:02:41.280]   - Uh-oh.
[02:02:41.280 --> 02:02:42.120]   - No, no.
[02:02:42.120 --> 02:02:42.960]   - But you don't wanna look like me.
[02:02:42.960 --> 02:02:45.080]   - Becky, the peach fuzz is fantastic.
[02:02:45.080 --> 02:02:46.200]   - I kinda do, that's a,
[02:02:46.200 --> 02:02:47.960]   well, being over 50, that happens.
[02:02:47.960 --> 02:02:48.800]   Friends, I hate you.
[02:02:48.800 --> 02:02:49.800]   - Oh, she is not over 50.
[02:02:49.800 --> 02:02:51.120]   Look how young.
[02:02:51.120 --> 02:02:52.240]   People were saying in the chair,
[02:02:52.240 --> 02:02:54.040]   "Backys, how does Becky not age?"
[02:02:54.040 --> 02:02:55.040]   - Becky, you get lost.
[02:02:55.040 --> 02:02:56.200]   How does she not age?
[02:02:56.200 --> 02:02:57.040]   She looks fantastic.
[02:02:57.040 --> 02:02:58.680]   - Do you turn off those filters so we can see them?
[02:02:58.680 --> 02:02:59.520]   - Gorgeous.
[02:02:59.520 --> 02:03:00.520]   - Right, what a fun year.
[02:03:00.520 --> 02:03:02.240]   - Your kids are in high school.
[02:03:02.240 --> 02:03:03.080]   - High school!
[02:03:03.080 --> 02:03:05.200]   Crazy.
[02:03:05.200 --> 02:03:07.720]   - Wow, great pictures on Instagram.
[02:03:07.720 --> 02:03:09.760]   I thank you for letting me follow you on Instagram.
[02:03:09.760 --> 02:03:12.760]   'Cause I just, it's how I stay up with you.
[02:03:12.760 --> 02:03:13.600]   - I know.
[02:03:13.600 --> 02:03:14.440]   - Great to see you.
[02:03:14.440 --> 02:03:16.080]   - The pros of social media, I love it.
[02:03:16.080 --> 02:03:16.920]   - It's the only good, yeah.
[02:03:16.920 --> 02:03:18.640]   - There's lots of cons, but there's lots of good.
[02:03:18.640 --> 02:03:20.360]   - No, it's the only good thing about it.
[02:03:20.360 --> 02:03:22.880]   And I hate that Instagram's turning into TikTok,
[02:03:22.880 --> 02:03:25.520]   'cause I really just wanna see pictures of my friends.
[02:03:25.520 --> 02:03:27.320]   That's all I really care about.
[02:03:27.320 --> 02:03:29.680]   Pictures by my friends or my friends.
[02:03:29.680 --> 02:03:33.320]   Mr. Will Harris, ooh, Unbound.com
[02:03:33.320 --> 02:03:36.640]   is the awesomest idea in book publishing.
[02:03:36.640 --> 02:03:41.640]   15% off Unbound titles, including the new Douglas Adams 42.
[02:03:41.640 --> 02:03:45.440]   - It's 15.
[02:03:45.440 --> 02:03:48.080]   - If you use the offer code TWIT15,
[02:03:48.080 --> 02:03:50.120]   that's very generous of you.
[02:03:50.120 --> 02:03:51.640]   But boy, I look at all this stuff.
[02:03:51.640 --> 02:03:53.600]   - It's such a pleasure to be back here for a while.
[02:03:53.600 --> 02:03:54.440]   - We love you.
[02:03:54.440 --> 02:03:56.040]   - Honestly, I wanna buy every book.
[02:03:56.040 --> 02:03:57.040]   - I can't pretend that I'm not aging
[02:03:57.040 --> 02:03:59.160]   in the same way that Becky isn't aging,
[02:03:59.160 --> 02:04:02.480]   but getting slightly better with age maybe.
[02:04:02.480 --> 02:04:03.720]   - Oh, you look great.
[02:04:03.720 --> 02:04:07.360]   I'll never forget, Lee said I were in London for five days,
[02:04:07.360 --> 02:04:09.960]   and we're walking down the street, we were running to Will.
[02:04:09.960 --> 02:04:12.720]   It's like in the biggest cities in the world,
[02:04:12.720 --> 02:04:14.160]   and we just run into you.
[02:04:14.160 --> 02:04:15.360]   You go, hi.
[02:04:15.360 --> 02:04:16.360]   - Fantastic.
[02:04:16.360 --> 02:04:17.200]   - Look at you.
[02:04:17.200 --> 02:04:18.280]   - Jesus, you're here.
[02:04:18.280 --> 02:04:21.400]   - I know one guy in London, and I ran into him.
[02:04:21.400 --> 02:04:22.400]   (laughing)
[02:04:22.400 --> 02:04:24.840]   - Anyway, great to have you Unbound.com,
[02:04:24.840 --> 02:04:28.360]   and of course, my Spaceman Rod Pyle,
[02:04:28.360 --> 02:04:31.880]   editor-in-chief of Ad Astra Magazine,
[02:04:31.880 --> 02:04:35.040]   space.nss.org, and the author of--
[02:04:35.040 --> 02:04:35.880]   - Come to books.
[02:04:35.880 --> 02:04:36.720]   (screaming)
[02:04:36.720 --> 02:04:40.280]   - I got the pile pile, all the pile books.
[02:04:40.280 --> 02:04:42.480]   - This is my favorite one.
[02:04:42.480 --> 02:04:44.480]   - Those aren't all of them, those are only a quarter of them.
[02:04:44.480 --> 02:04:45.320]   - No, I know, you're close.
[02:04:45.320 --> 02:04:46.440]   - I couldn't lift it with all of them.
[02:04:46.440 --> 02:04:48.840]   This is the best one though, which came out
[02:04:48.840 --> 02:04:50.720]   a couple of years ago on the 50th anniversary
[02:04:50.720 --> 02:04:53.480]   of Apollo 11, first on the moon.
[02:04:53.480 --> 02:04:55.480]   And I never get to show this on the radio show,
[02:04:55.480 --> 02:04:58.040]   but it's a picture book about Apollo 11.
[02:04:58.040 --> 02:05:00.400]   It's incredible, you did such a nice job of this.
[02:05:00.400 --> 02:05:01.240]   - Thanks.
[02:05:01.240 --> 02:05:02.240]   - I love it, and that's--
[02:05:02.240 --> 02:05:04.080]   - And maybe one of the last pictures books,
[02:05:04.080 --> 02:05:04.920]   'cause they're--
[02:05:04.920 --> 02:05:05.760]   - They're so expensive.
[02:05:05.760 --> 02:05:06.600]   - They're not doing them anymore.
[02:05:06.600 --> 02:05:08.040]   - No, nope, no.
[02:05:08.040 --> 02:05:11.880]   They're planetary robots, amazing stories of the Space Age.
[02:05:11.880 --> 02:05:13.520]   Blue Print for a--
[02:05:13.520 --> 02:05:15.640]   - Was gonna be a Death Star, but they had to change it.
[02:05:15.640 --> 02:05:18.120]   - The Battle Star, and of course--
[02:05:18.120 --> 02:05:19.400]   - Thanks, Disney.
[02:05:19.400 --> 02:05:21.720]   - And the Ad Astra magazine.
[02:05:21.720 --> 02:05:26.520]   If you wanna read about his trip to Mars on planet Earth,
[02:05:26.520 --> 02:05:28.720]   space.com has a lot of the stories,
[02:05:28.720 --> 02:05:32.880]   but also they'll appear in Ad Astra, the magazine,
[02:05:32.880 --> 02:05:34.880]   in coming issues, and of course,
[02:05:34.880 --> 02:05:37.240]   Rod's the host of This Week in Space with Terry Malick
[02:05:37.240 --> 02:05:38.080]   of space.com.
[02:05:38.080 --> 02:05:39.680]   - Who is at the Artemis launch.
[02:05:39.680 --> 02:05:40.520]   - Is he?
[02:05:40.520 --> 02:05:41.360]   - Yeah.
[02:05:41.360 --> 02:05:43.080]   - I tried to message him to see if we could get him on
[02:05:43.080 --> 02:05:43.920]   for a couple of seconds.
[02:05:43.920 --> 02:05:44.760]   - Oh, it would have been fun.
[02:05:44.760 --> 02:05:46.000]   - All right, well keep your eye peeled,
[02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:47.360]   he might show up.
[02:05:47.360 --> 02:05:50.040]   Our show today brought to you by Wealthfront.
[02:05:50.040 --> 02:05:51.760]   We're just talking about finances.
[02:05:51.760 --> 02:05:54.680]   Wealthfront is a financial services company.
[02:05:54.680 --> 02:05:57.560]   They were founded in 2008 with a goal to make
[02:05:57.560 --> 02:06:01.080]   building long-term wealth delightfully easy.
[02:06:01.080 --> 02:06:04.480]   Look, if you saw the market lately,
[02:06:04.480 --> 02:06:06.520]   you probably don't like what you saw.
[02:06:06.520 --> 02:06:09.640]   You shouldn't be looking at it every day,
[02:06:09.640 --> 02:06:12.000]   seeing as a matter of perspective,
[02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:14.640]   Wealthfront's an investing app with a different vision.
[02:06:14.640 --> 02:06:19.080]   One focused on this so important long-term wealth,

[02:06:21.040 --> 02:06:23.520]   even the one we're in now.

[02:06:35.280 --> 02:06:37.920]   and weather whatever volatility's happening.
[02:06:37.920 --> 02:06:39.680]   The trick to wealth isn't timing,
[02:06:39.680 --> 02:06:42.160]   it's just simply time.
[02:06:42.160 --> 02:06:44.120]   By automating your investments,
[02:06:44.120 --> 02:06:46.400]   it's easier to invest regularly,
[02:06:46.400 --> 02:06:48.640]   regardless of the ups and downs of volatility.
[02:06:48.640 --> 02:06:49.800]   Don't pay attention to that.
[02:06:49.800 --> 02:06:51.760]   If you want to invest for long-term,
[02:06:51.760 --> 02:06:55.000]   while the market is basically having a clearance sale,

[02:08:10.600 --> 02:08:12.840]   Anybody watch the house of the dragon?
[02:08:12.840 --> 02:08:13.720]   Anybody?
[02:08:13.720 --> 02:08:14.560]   HBO.
[02:08:14.560 --> 02:08:15.400]   Oh yes.
[02:08:15.400 --> 02:08:16.320]   Oh yes.
[02:08:16.320 --> 02:08:19.200]   Oh you have HBO in the UK?
[02:08:19.200 --> 02:08:21.720]   No, it has over here on Sky.
[02:08:21.720 --> 02:08:22.560]   Sky.
[02:08:22.560 --> 02:08:25.320]   We don't have HBO over here, but it has on Sky.
[02:08:25.320 --> 02:08:26.840]   All right.
[02:08:26.840 --> 02:08:27.680]   Did you watch it, Becky?
[02:08:27.680 --> 02:08:30.280]   Are you a Game of Thrones fan?
[02:08:30.280 --> 02:08:33.040]   I cannot explain this, but despite the fact
[02:08:33.040 --> 02:08:35.880]   that I love full-contact sports like football,
[02:08:35.880 --> 02:08:39.880]   have played rugby, I can't stomach the house of violence.
[02:08:39.880 --> 02:08:41.480]   Too violent.
[02:08:41.480 --> 02:08:44.760]   Well, and this, by the way, this premier episode last Sunday.
[02:08:44.760 --> 02:08:47.000]   Oh yeah.
[02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:49.000]   It was very controversial.
[02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:53.720]   There's a childbirth scene which is extremely graphic and gory.
[02:08:53.720 --> 02:08:57.160]   And a lot of people said, "I didn't need to see that."
[02:08:57.160 --> 02:09:04.280]   The traditional HBO house of ill-repute, bravo, romp, that's fine.
[02:09:04.280 --> 02:09:06.440]   But you got to do that.
[02:09:06.440 --> 02:09:07.720]   But the job--
[02:09:07.720 --> 02:09:09.080]   And everyone needs a little romp.
[02:09:09.080 --> 02:09:10.600]   He needs a little brothel.
[02:09:10.600 --> 02:09:11.120]   Bravo romp.
[02:09:11.120 --> 02:09:12.040]   What are you really doing?
[02:09:12.040 --> 02:09:12.520]   Yeah.
[02:09:12.520 --> 02:09:13.960]   Yeah.
[02:09:13.960 --> 02:09:15.560]   That's kind of my middle name, brothel romp.
[02:09:15.560 --> 02:09:16.200]   No.
[02:09:16.200 --> 02:09:17.720]   No, I shouldn't say that.
[02:09:17.720 --> 02:09:18.520]   Not true.
[02:09:18.520 --> 02:09:19.240]   Not true.
[02:09:19.240 --> 02:09:19.960]   It's not true.
[02:09:19.960 --> 02:09:22.760]   Brother Rompleport, that's what we call him.
[02:09:22.760 --> 02:09:24.040]   There is no Tyrion.
[02:09:24.040 --> 02:09:26.520]   Becky's got the funniest look on her face to this whole thing.
[02:09:26.520 --> 02:09:27.240]   She doesn't--
[02:09:27.240 --> 02:09:28.120]   What is going on?
[02:09:28.120 --> 02:09:29.480]   She knows me better than that.
[02:09:29.480 --> 02:09:30.520]   No, it's--
[02:09:30.520 --> 02:09:31.960]   He's not a brothel romper.
[02:09:31.960 --> 02:09:33.400]   Not a brothel romper.
[02:09:33.400 --> 02:09:36.200]   No, I have never been a brothel romper.
[02:09:36.200 --> 02:09:38.760]   How many times have you tried to get me to romp in a brothel?
[02:09:38.760 --> 02:09:40.440]   But no, I say no every time.
[02:09:40.440 --> 02:09:41.480]   No, he says no.
[02:09:41.480 --> 02:09:41.960]   What do you mean?
[02:09:41.960 --> 02:09:45.000]   It's infuriating.
[02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:46.120]   He prefers the masked--
[02:09:46.120 --> 02:09:47.000]   He's the masked child.
[02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:48.120]   He's the masked child.
[02:09:48.120 --> 02:09:48.840]   I like--
[02:09:48.840 --> 02:09:50.520]   --corner and making miserable.
[02:09:50.520 --> 02:09:52.280]   And I know something about a brothel romper.
[02:09:52.280 --> 02:09:52.840]   Yes.
[02:09:52.840 --> 02:09:55.080]   So HBO-- I'm so sorry.
[02:09:55.080 --> 02:09:55.880]   I'm so sorry.
[02:09:55.880 --> 02:09:59.080]   They shouldn't allow me on live anything, right?
[02:09:59.080 --> 02:10:00.680]   It's just a mistake.
[02:10:00.680 --> 02:10:03.320]   HBO said 10 million viewers watched the episode.
[02:10:03.320 --> 02:10:05.480]   That is a very big number.
[02:10:05.480 --> 02:10:08.120]   In fact, the biggest start for a series in HBO history.
[02:10:08.120 --> 02:10:09.400]   When we talked about it last week,
[02:10:09.400 --> 02:10:10.680]   there was some concern that people--
[02:10:10.680 --> 02:10:16.040]   because of the bitter taste from the end of Game of Thrones--
[02:10:16.040 --> 02:10:17.000]   people wouldn't watch this.
[02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:20.600]   Like, I'm done with that series, apparently not.
[02:10:20.600 --> 02:10:21.640]   In fact, it did so well.
[02:10:21.640 --> 02:10:25.000]   They immediately greenlit it for a second season.
[02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:29.000]   And I didn't know this, but HBO has five other spin-offs
[02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:30.520]   in development.
[02:10:30.520 --> 02:10:31.160]   Wow.
[02:10:31.160 --> 02:10:34.440]   Well, not only do they have the spin-offs in development,
[02:10:34.440 --> 02:10:37.400]   but they have the Easter eggs of the spin-offs
[02:10:37.400 --> 02:10:39.640]   in the House of the Dragon opening.
[02:10:39.640 --> 02:10:40.520]   Oh, now wait a minute.
[02:10:40.520 --> 02:10:42.360]   So you watched this more closely than I did.
[02:10:42.360 --> 02:10:44.120]   Tell me.
[02:10:44.120 --> 02:10:47.720]   So one of the-- so yeah, I am a bit of a geek for this stuff.
[02:10:47.720 --> 02:10:49.560]   One of the reasons that I love watching it
[02:10:49.560 --> 02:10:52.120]   is so I can listen to podcasts afterwards, where you get--
[02:10:52.120 --> 02:10:52.600]   Wow.
[02:10:52.600 --> 02:10:53.560]   --to keep you structured, right?
[02:10:53.560 --> 02:10:55.560]   HBO has its official one.
[02:10:55.560 --> 02:10:56.680]   Is that the good one?
[02:10:56.680 --> 02:10:57.800]   Which is-- no.
[02:10:57.800 --> 02:10:59.240]   It's quite good.
[02:10:59.240 --> 02:11:02.520]   I would say the best one is a chap that you surely know,
[02:11:02.520 --> 02:11:06.600]   a chap called Dave Chen, who has a website called Decoding TV,
[02:11:06.600 --> 02:11:10.120]   where he does breakdowns of all of this stuff.
[02:11:10.120 --> 02:11:13.320]   And one of the things they talk about
[02:11:13.320 --> 02:11:19.080]   is the main sort of princess in it.
[02:11:19.080 --> 02:11:19.640]   Yeah.
[02:11:19.640 --> 02:11:22.760]   Gives a little-- a little minor law dump
[02:11:22.760 --> 02:11:25.280]   in the middle of the episode about a queen called
[02:11:25.280 --> 02:11:31.400]   Nymeria, who sails to Dorne and then
[02:11:31.400 --> 02:11:34.840]   burns all her ships off the coast of Dorne in order
[02:11:34.840 --> 02:11:39.480]   to say that their people are running no longer,
[02:11:39.480 --> 02:11:41.480]   that we're going to burn the ships because we're staying here
[02:11:41.480 --> 02:11:43.360]   come hell or high water.
[02:11:43.360 --> 02:11:45.880]   And the story of Nymeria, the queen,
[02:11:45.880 --> 02:11:48.440]   is one of the other spin-offs that is in development--
[02:11:48.440 --> 02:11:49.920]   Oh, yeah.
[02:11:49.920 --> 02:11:51.160]   --at HBO.
[02:11:51.160 --> 02:11:53.760]   And of course, Nymeria, as a strong woman,
[02:11:53.760 --> 02:11:56.800]   was the name of Arya Stark's wolf, Dial.
[02:11:56.800 --> 02:11:57.800]   Nymeria.
[02:11:57.800 --> 02:11:59.120]   It's a series of Game of Thrones.
[02:11:59.120 --> 02:12:00.160]   You're right.
[02:12:00.160 --> 02:12:01.320]   I knew I knew that.
[02:12:01.320 --> 02:12:05.320]   It's almost like there's a little plan.
[02:12:05.320 --> 02:12:09.680]   There's a moment in it that you have a joust, brutal, vicious.
[02:12:09.680 --> 02:12:10.560]   I mean--
[02:12:10.560 --> 02:12:11.400]   Also, sorry.
[02:12:11.400 --> 02:12:13.000]   What are the rules of that, Jarrith?
[02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:16.280]   At what point do you club the guy's head in versus just go,
[02:12:16.280 --> 02:12:16.880]   oh, I use it for the first time?
[02:12:16.880 --> 02:12:17.920]   Sometimes you go--
[02:12:17.920 --> 02:12:18.420]   No.
[02:12:18.420 --> 02:12:19.160]   --that's my bad.
[02:12:19.160 --> 02:12:19.680]   Yeah, right.
[02:12:19.680 --> 02:12:20.400]   Sometimes you just--
[02:12:20.400 --> 02:12:20.680]   Oh, my bad.
[02:12:20.680 --> 02:12:21.600]   --put it up for it.
[02:12:21.600 --> 02:12:21.920]   There was--
[02:12:21.920 --> 02:12:25.360]   I really feel like the guy who got his head club in really
[02:12:25.360 --> 02:12:26.000]   had the chance to yield.
[02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:28.080]   To get a fair chance to yield.
[02:12:28.080 --> 02:12:29.920]   No, he'd immediately.
[02:12:29.920 --> 02:12:33.240]   But at the end of it, when it's over,
[02:12:33.240 --> 02:12:35.680]   Night who won takes his helmet off.
[02:12:35.680 --> 02:12:38.160]   And there's this moment where the two princesses look
[02:12:38.160 --> 02:12:42.720]   at each other meaningfully and say, oh, he's Dornish.
[02:12:42.720 --> 02:12:43.600]   And I thought, oh, crap.
[02:12:43.600 --> 02:12:44.840]   What does that mean?
[02:12:44.840 --> 02:12:47.640]   I kind of watch all eight seasons of--
[02:12:47.640 --> 02:12:48.600]   I can't remember.
[02:12:48.600 --> 02:12:50.160]   Dornish, what does that mean?
[02:12:50.160 --> 02:12:51.400]   So I'm sure there's some stuff--
[02:12:51.400 --> 02:12:52.480]   Listen to the recap.
[02:12:52.480 --> 02:12:56.000]   I have to listen to the recap, please.
[02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:57.240]   The reason I bring this up--
[02:12:57.240 --> 02:12:58.280]   I'm still a little bit of OK.
[02:12:58.280 --> 02:12:59.520]   No, no, you.
[02:12:59.520 --> 02:13:02.320]   I was just doing the math on how much this thing cost.
[02:13:02.320 --> 02:13:03.160]   Yes.
[02:13:03.160 --> 02:13:05.120]   That's the reason I bring it up.
[02:13:05.120 --> 02:13:08.520]   20 million in episode four--
[02:13:08.520 --> 02:13:09.200]   what is this thing called?
[02:13:09.200 --> 02:13:10.120]   House of the Dragon?
[02:13:10.120 --> 02:13:11.160]   House of the Dragon, yeah.
[02:13:11.160 --> 02:13:12.080]   What does it call it?
[02:13:12.080 --> 02:13:13.720]   That sounds like a lot, right?
[02:13:13.720 --> 02:13:17.680]   But get this, 30 million in episode for Stranger Things
[02:13:17.680 --> 02:13:21.040]   and 40 million in episode for the Lord of the Rings prequel.
[02:13:21.040 --> 02:13:23.880]   Get ready because that's coming next week.
[02:13:23.880 --> 02:13:25.200]   And this is the real battle.
[02:13:25.200 --> 02:13:29.320]   It's Amazon and streaming versus Warner Brothers
[02:13:29.320 --> 02:13:32.600]   and traditional filmmaking, television, HBO.
[02:13:32.600 --> 02:13:34.680]   I mean, admittedly HBO is now as much a streamer
[02:13:34.680 --> 02:13:35.840]   as they are a cable channel.
[02:13:35.840 --> 02:13:39.360]   But really, that's the battle because Amazon essentially
[02:13:39.360 --> 02:13:42.160]   has unlimited funds.
[02:13:42.160 --> 02:13:44.800]   They don't have to make the money back in the streaming.
[02:13:44.800 --> 02:13:46.400]   Is this a lost lender for them?
[02:13:46.400 --> 02:13:46.960]   I mean, is that OK?
[02:13:46.960 --> 02:13:48.480]   I think it can be, yes.
[02:13:48.480 --> 02:13:51.520]   Yeah, so the way that someone explained it to me,
[02:13:51.520 --> 02:13:54.040]   which I thought was like a really good analogy in and maybe
[02:13:54.040 --> 02:13:56.320]   we'll resonate with your American audience,
[02:13:56.320 --> 02:14:00.440]   is the Lakers, the Los Angeles Lakers, right, in NBA,
[02:14:00.440 --> 02:14:02.600]   like the premium NBA franchise.
[02:14:02.600 --> 02:14:05.200]   Like everybody wants to work for the Lakers.
[02:14:05.200 --> 02:14:10.360]   But the bus family that owns the Lakers, that's their business.
[02:14:10.360 --> 02:14:10.920]   Right, right.
[02:14:10.920 --> 02:14:14.160]   So they have to make good business decisions for the Lakers.
[02:14:14.160 --> 02:14:15.640]   Are you going to compare this to the Lakers?
[02:14:15.640 --> 02:14:18.560]   The mighty ducks.
[02:14:18.560 --> 02:14:19.200]   No, no, no, no.
[02:14:19.200 --> 02:14:21.400]   What we're going to go with is that's HBO.
[02:14:21.400 --> 02:14:25.760]   So HBO has to make sensible decisions and good money.
[02:14:25.760 --> 02:14:26.960]   Because they're like the Lakers.
[02:14:26.960 --> 02:14:28.280]   They're like the bus family.
[02:14:28.280 --> 02:14:29.120]   Yes.
[02:14:29.120 --> 02:14:30.360]   Because that's their own money.
[02:14:30.360 --> 02:14:31.120]   Yes.
[02:14:31.120 --> 02:14:34.600]   Yeah, whereas Amazon, Amazon ironically, is the Steve Ballmer.
[02:14:34.600 --> 02:14:37.680]   Steve Ballmer owns the Los Angeles Clippers
[02:14:37.680 --> 02:14:39.800]   and could just spend however much money he wants.
[02:14:39.800 --> 02:14:41.840]   Because the Clippers aren't his money.
[02:14:41.840 --> 02:14:43.960]   That's like the side hustle.
[02:14:43.960 --> 02:14:47.440]   The Clippers are the side hobby for Amazon prime video
[02:14:47.440 --> 02:14:48.320]   in the Lord of the Rings.
[02:14:48.320 --> 02:14:51.240]   It's just like a few hundred million there, a few hundred
[02:14:51.240 --> 02:14:52.040]   million a year.
[02:14:52.040 --> 02:14:54.080]   That's not going to impact on the core business.
[02:14:54.080 --> 02:14:56.280]   And it's the difference between operating a streamer
[02:14:56.280 --> 02:15:00.680]   as your core business or a streamer as your little side hustle.
[02:15:00.680 --> 02:15:06.920]   No, I would actually compare it to the Anaheim Ducks.
[02:15:06.920 --> 02:15:11.320]   Which is the LA Lakers and the Anaheim Ducks.
[02:15:11.320 --> 02:15:13.960]   The Ducks are owned by Disney, which
[02:15:13.960 --> 02:15:15.760]   made a movie called the Mighty Ducks.
[02:15:15.760 --> 02:15:19.560]   They make money off of the merchandising, the branding.
[02:15:19.560 --> 02:15:22.080]   They don't have to make money off the hockey team.
[02:15:22.080 --> 02:15:23.040]   So it's like that though.
[02:15:23.040 --> 02:15:23.520]   You're right.
[02:15:23.520 --> 02:15:26.680]   They don't have to make money off the prime.
[02:15:26.680 --> 02:15:28.280]   I didn't get hyper local enough.
[02:15:28.280 --> 02:15:29.560]   I should have gone hyper local.
[02:15:29.560 --> 02:15:32.160]   You know, one thing that has ever heard of the Anaheim Ducks.
[02:15:32.160 --> 02:15:34.320]   So I don't blame you.
[02:15:34.320 --> 02:15:34.920]   What's the--
[02:15:34.920 --> 02:15:37.160]   Also, the other thing is that the Amazon play,
[02:15:37.160 --> 02:15:40.680]   the difference is they can end Disney with the Mighty Ducks
[02:15:40.680 --> 02:15:44.120]   is the cross promotion that can exist between their properties.
[02:15:44.120 --> 02:15:47.000]   So not only is it--
[02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:48.600]   it can be a lost leader for other things,
[02:15:48.600 --> 02:15:50.880]   but they can use it to cross promote other things
[02:15:50.880 --> 02:15:52.600]   that are more profitable.
[02:15:52.600 --> 02:15:53.400]   So--
[02:15:53.400 --> 02:15:56.480]   Whereas HBO can't really have Matt Smith in "Hounce of the Dragon"
[02:15:56.480 --> 02:16:00.520]   sort of catching up on an episode of "Sex and the City."
[02:16:00.520 --> 02:16:01.020]   Wow.
[02:16:01.020 --> 02:16:03.040]   That was probably gone too far afield for me.
[02:16:03.040 --> 02:16:04.920]   I don't understand anything that's happened.
[02:16:04.920 --> 02:16:11.000]   At some point do these serializations or spinoffs
[02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:13.440]   from "Game of Thrones" start becoming like the whole law
[02:16:13.440 --> 02:16:14.680]   and order thing.
[02:16:14.680 --> 02:16:15.680]   And if so--
[02:16:15.680 --> 02:16:17.280]   Game of Thrones special is that is--
[02:16:17.280 --> 02:16:17.840]   Especially because unit--
[02:16:17.840 --> 02:16:18.920]   Yeah, right.
[02:16:18.920 --> 02:16:21.560]   As awful as that gets.
[02:16:21.560 --> 02:16:24.040]   If you're looking at a third or fourth tier spinoff--
[02:16:24.040 --> 02:16:25.680]   and I'm just thinking to this because of my time
[02:16:25.680 --> 02:16:28.480]   to start track and watching that whole thing fracture
[02:16:28.480 --> 02:16:31.040]   into the weirdness that it has--
[02:16:31.040 --> 02:16:33.000]   what are the budget limits become then?
[02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:35.440]   Because I mean, you hear these numbers for "Stranger Things."
[02:16:35.440 --> 02:16:36.240]   I heard that number.
[02:16:36.240 --> 02:16:38.000]   I think when I was working on "Trek,"
[02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:40.240]   a big show for us was like a million won.
[02:16:40.240 --> 02:16:40.600]   Oh, yeah.
[02:16:40.600 --> 02:16:41.240]   That was expensive.
[02:16:41.240 --> 02:16:42.720]   40 million in an episode.
[02:16:42.720 --> 02:16:43.220]   Right.
[02:16:43.220 --> 02:16:43.720]   So--
[02:16:43.720 --> 02:16:44.220]   [BEEP]
[02:16:44.220 --> 02:16:45.360]   --but it looks like a movie.
[02:16:45.360 --> 02:16:45.880]   So--
[02:16:45.880 --> 02:16:46.400]   Right.
[02:16:46.400 --> 02:16:48.400]   Part of my brain is saying, well, that kind of makes sense.
[02:16:48.400 --> 02:16:50.560]   Because when you're producing, you have a money meter running
[02:16:50.560 --> 02:16:52.040]   in the back of your mind all the time, right?
[02:16:52.040 --> 02:16:54.440]   Part of that makes sense for the kind of visuals they're getting.
[02:16:54.440 --> 02:16:56.640]   But you've got to commit to making
[02:16:56.640 --> 02:17:00.520]   what would be a whole franchise of movies in one season.
[02:17:00.520 --> 02:17:01.240]   What's the average?
[02:17:01.240 --> 02:17:02.280]   8 to 10?
[02:17:02.280 --> 02:17:02.780]   Yes.
[02:17:02.780 --> 02:17:03.560]   That's what most of these--
[02:17:03.560 --> 02:17:05.040]   And then you start doing these spins.
[02:17:05.040 --> 02:17:08.400]   Well, can the fifth or sixth tier spinoff from--
[02:17:08.400 --> 02:17:09.320]   Well, not to mention the thing--
[02:17:09.320 --> 02:17:13.320]   Game of Thrones and CIS have the same budget as the first one?
[02:17:13.320 --> 02:17:15.240]   In order to acquire all of these,
[02:17:15.240 --> 02:17:19.640]   AT&T took on $50 billion in debt.
[02:17:19.640 --> 02:17:24.280]   So HBO Warner is deep in debt.
[02:17:24.280 --> 02:17:24.800]   Huge.
[02:17:24.800 --> 02:17:24.800]   Huge.
[02:17:24.800 --> 02:17:25.560]   By Yahoo.
[02:17:25.560 --> 02:17:26.320]   That'd be a big one.
[02:17:26.320 --> 02:17:26.840]   Yeah, right.
[02:17:26.840 --> 02:17:28.440]   Huge debt.
[02:17:28.440 --> 02:17:31.800]   So they don't have a lot of runway.
[02:17:31.800 --> 02:17:33.400]   They've canceled a bunch of shows.
[02:17:33.400 --> 02:17:36.720]   They canceled Batgirl, $90 million investment
[02:17:36.720 --> 02:17:37.800]   because they could--
[02:17:37.800 --> 02:17:38.760]   Brandy it off in their taxes.
[02:17:38.760 --> 02:17:39.720]   Sorry, what?
[02:17:39.720 --> 02:17:41.040]   Batgirl.
[02:17:41.040 --> 02:17:42.240]   Oh, you have been away.
[02:17:42.240 --> 02:17:43.960]   Yeah.
[02:17:43.960 --> 02:17:45.040]   They do a herd of this.
[02:17:45.040 --> 02:17:46.040]   No way.
[02:17:46.040 --> 02:17:46.540]   What?
[02:17:46.540 --> 02:17:47.240]   They did another--
[02:17:47.240 --> 02:17:47.920]   They got a month.
[02:17:47.920 --> 02:17:50.000]   They shot a movie for $90 million
[02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:51.200]   and then canceled it.
[02:17:51.200 --> 02:17:52.880]   Batgirl.
[02:17:52.880 --> 02:17:55.560]   You probably don't know about Scoob, the Christmas show,
[02:17:55.560 --> 02:17:57.040]   either.
[02:17:57.040 --> 02:17:59.600]   But I think that that's what you're seeing now
[02:17:59.600 --> 02:18:01.120]   is big, big money.
[02:18:01.120 --> 02:18:03.440]   And Netflix, even, which is still the king of streamers,
[02:18:03.440 --> 02:18:07.160]   8% of all streams are Netflix streams,
[02:18:07.160 --> 02:18:08.840]   is running against headwinds.
[02:18:08.840 --> 02:18:11.640]   Their stuff is very expensive.
[02:18:11.640 --> 02:18:14.640]   And what you're seeing is the--
[02:18:14.640 --> 02:18:19.760]   if you look at the news today, which is the increasing--
[02:18:19.760 --> 02:18:20.840]   or is this a word?
[02:18:20.840 --> 02:18:22.360]   Dreamarization of cinema.
[02:18:22.360 --> 02:18:23.200]   Oh, like it.
[02:18:23.200 --> 02:18:24.200]   Yeah.
[02:18:24.200 --> 02:18:28.000]   Which is the big, hot, marvel property
[02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:29.600]   that everyone's wondering what's going to happen to
[02:18:29.600 --> 02:18:32.600]   is Fantastic Four.
[02:18:32.600 --> 02:18:35.040]   And we heard the news, I think this morning,
[02:18:35.040 --> 02:18:38.680]   or yesterday, that Matt Schachman, who helmed one division
[02:18:38.680 --> 02:18:41.040]   for Disney, is going to be the person in charge
[02:18:41.040 --> 02:18:42.400]   of Fantastic Four.
[02:18:42.400 --> 02:18:43.960]   And a lot of the film Twitter commentary
[02:18:43.960 --> 02:18:46.640]   was, well, I guess we're not hiring film directors
[02:18:46.640 --> 02:18:48.160]   to make films anymore.
[02:18:48.160 --> 02:18:53.440]   We're TV-izing film, which is effectively what Disney has done.
[02:18:53.440 --> 02:18:56.160]   If you look at the Star Wars series,
[02:18:56.160 --> 02:18:59.840]   the Marvel series, which are all shot in the volume,
[02:18:59.840 --> 02:19:06.320]   it's the TV-ization, the streaming-ization of cinema.
[02:19:06.320 --> 02:19:09.760]   Well, this is the hypothesis that we're at Peak TV.
[02:19:09.760 --> 02:19:10.760]   Yes.
[02:19:10.760 --> 02:19:12.760]   Because of COVID, because of streaming,
[02:19:12.760 --> 02:19:17.720]   because of multi-tiered pricing options that Peak TV is now.
[02:19:17.720 --> 02:19:21.680]   And whether this can last or not is the question.
[02:19:21.680 --> 02:19:24.160]   And we're seeing that with the financial troubles being
[02:19:24.160 --> 02:19:26.960]   experienced by the likes of Netflix and others.
[02:19:26.960 --> 02:19:30.400]   So is this the peak of Peak TV?
[02:19:30.400 --> 02:19:31.040]   Maybe.
[02:19:31.040 --> 02:19:33.440]   This is the article from the Financial Times,
[02:19:33.440 --> 02:19:37.800]   which is hidden behind a very expensive pay wall.
[02:19:37.800 --> 02:19:42.280]   That in fact, the guy who coined the term Peak TV,
[02:19:42.280 --> 02:19:45.760]   John Landgraf has been predicting it since 2016.
[02:19:45.760 --> 02:19:47.200]   But he said this year--
[02:19:47.200 --> 02:19:48.400]   Well, if you predicted every year,
[02:19:48.400 --> 02:19:49.600]   you're going to be like one year, right?
[02:19:49.600 --> 02:19:55.000]   He said this year, it really is the peak of the Peak TV era.
[02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:59.280]   He is chair of Disney's FX network.
[02:19:59.280 --> 02:20:04.440]   Amazon Prime, Lord of the Rings, set $465 million budget.
[02:20:04.440 --> 02:20:07.680]   They could make Top Gun Maverick three times over.
[02:20:07.680 --> 02:20:13.400]   House of Dragons, the Dragon, 200 million for 10 episodes.
[02:20:13.400 --> 02:20:17.440]   Disney Plus has Star Wars andor, She-Hulk,
[02:20:17.440 --> 02:20:22.520]   Attorney-at-Law, which is probably the best name of any of them.
[02:20:22.520 --> 02:20:23.560]   That's like Sharknado.
[02:20:23.560 --> 02:20:30.600]   The thing is that companies like Amazon Apple
[02:20:30.600 --> 02:20:35.040]   are subsidizing it with their vast profits from other arenas.
[02:20:35.040 --> 02:20:37.920]   But Netflix, HBO.
[02:20:37.920 --> 02:20:40.760]   Well, meantime, Leo, in the rundown,
[02:20:40.760 --> 02:20:44.240]   we've got the Netflix advertising plan,
[02:20:44.240 --> 02:20:47.520]   which will be about half the current price, $79 a month,
[02:20:47.520 --> 02:20:50.640]   with four minutes of ants per hour.
[02:20:50.640 --> 02:20:54.280]   Doesn't that feel like a Hail Mary?
[02:20:54.280 --> 02:20:55.160]   This is it.
[02:20:55.160 --> 02:20:57.600]   But that's what Amazon's doing with Freebie.
[02:20:57.600 --> 02:21:00.160]   Freebie, but they tell you, this is free.
[02:21:00.160 --> 02:21:01.840]   It's crappy TV.
[02:21:01.840 --> 02:21:02.840]   Yeah.
[02:21:02.840 --> 02:21:04.360]   Well, they didn't tell me that.
[02:21:04.360 --> 02:21:06.480]   Like, Freebie as an adult is sort of like--
[02:21:06.480 --> 02:21:07.000]   Yeah.
[02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:08.000]   --is not Amazon Prime.
[02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:08.500]   Netflix.
[02:21:08.500 --> 02:21:09.000]   Netflix.
[02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:10.440]   What happened with cable TV were--
[02:21:10.440 --> 02:21:12.800]   I mean, we all remember, because we're older,
[02:21:12.800 --> 02:21:15.560]   that cable was originally-- you sent it out to the hinterlands
[02:21:15.560 --> 02:21:17.680]   where people couldn't get real television.
[02:21:17.680 --> 02:21:20.280]   And then it became this thing with all this cool programming,
[02:21:20.280 --> 02:21:22.120]   and you paid for it so you wouldn't have ads.
[02:21:22.120 --> 02:21:24.800]   And then suddenly, it was filled with ads, just like everything else.
[02:21:24.800 --> 02:21:27.600]   And I feel like we're being hit with that again.
[02:21:27.600 --> 02:21:31.440]   John in our chat room says, "Freebie is Amazon's subprime video."
[02:21:31.440 --> 02:21:32.440]   Yes.
[02:21:32.440 --> 02:21:33.440]   It's so bad.
[02:21:33.440 --> 02:21:34.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:21:34.440 --> 02:21:36.280]   And of course, it's the full swap video.
[02:21:36.280 --> 02:21:39.720]   If you remember network television from the day--
[02:21:39.720 --> 02:21:42.160]   and again, thinking back on track episodes,
[02:21:42.160 --> 02:21:45.440]   you had four or five ad breaks, depending on what ear it was.
[02:21:45.440 --> 02:21:46.560]   They were programmed in.
[02:21:46.560 --> 02:21:48.080]   They were written into the script.
[02:21:48.080 --> 02:21:50.880]   So at the end of each act, you did the close up of the--
[02:21:50.880 --> 02:21:52.320]   I know, you don't have the best thing in the world.
[02:21:52.320 --> 02:21:53.320]   --staring off camera.
[02:21:53.320 --> 02:21:55.760]   But now they just dropped the ads in with a battle ad.
[02:21:55.760 --> 02:21:56.800]   It's awful.
[02:21:56.800 --> 02:22:00.400]   The best thing in the world though is to binge a show that was ad
[02:22:00.400 --> 02:22:01.760]   supported.
[02:22:01.760 --> 02:22:04.240]   And the character looks off and it goes black.
[02:22:04.240 --> 02:22:05.120]   And then it comes back.
[02:22:05.120 --> 02:22:05.960]   And you didn't want to--
[02:22:05.960 --> 02:22:06.960]   It was on and again.
[02:22:06.960 --> 02:22:12.520]   But that's how we experienced so much TV over here growing up.
[02:22:12.520 --> 02:22:14.440]   You now realize how unnatural that was.
[02:22:14.440 --> 02:22:18.440]   Watching Star Trek, the next generation on BBC.
[02:22:18.440 --> 02:22:22.160]   And you would get the moment where Picard is suddenly
[02:22:22.160 --> 02:22:24.920]   sort of looking into the distance very meaningfully.
[02:22:24.920 --> 02:22:27.520]   And you'd think, oh, good, what's about to happen?
[02:22:27.520 --> 02:22:29.800]   And you'd get a fade to black and then a fade to black.
[02:22:29.800 --> 02:22:30.800]   Stay back up.
[02:22:30.800 --> 02:22:31.640]   And now we know.
[02:22:31.640 --> 02:22:36.040]   It was only nine-year-old watching Star Trek.
[02:22:36.040 --> 02:22:38.320]   You have no idea why that was the case.
[02:22:38.320 --> 02:22:40.840]   Brits have a very different relationship to advertising.
[02:22:40.840 --> 02:22:43.880]   When we do our ads, I always hear from people who
[02:22:43.880 --> 02:22:46.080]   listen to the UK saying, wait a minute, you're the host of the
[02:22:46.080 --> 02:22:48.080]   show and you're doing the ad?
[02:22:48.080 --> 02:22:51.840]   That's apparently verboten in-- well, that's probably not
[02:22:51.840 --> 02:22:52.680]   the right word to use.
[02:22:52.680 --> 02:22:54.400]   But they have the thing in the UK.
[02:22:54.400 --> 02:22:55.520]   I'll run into the ad.
[02:22:55.520 --> 02:22:58.520]   You're sort of in the right geographical area.
[02:22:58.520 --> 02:23:00.280]   You were a few thousand miles.
[02:23:00.280 --> 02:23:01.280]   Bad rugby.
[02:23:01.280 --> 02:23:04.960]   Yeah, it's very strange because we have a very weird
[02:23:04.960 --> 02:23:10.040]   relationship to the BBC, which obviously is not ad-supported.
[02:23:10.040 --> 02:23:14.680]   But which therefore kind of skews our thoughts on advertising.
[02:23:14.680 --> 02:23:16.280]   We were talking about that in a very helpful way.
[02:23:16.280 --> 02:23:18.720]   In the Twitter forums, the Twitter community, because Big
[02:23:18.720 --> 02:23:22.840]   D lives in Germany, where there's a very robust public
[02:23:22.840 --> 02:23:23.280]   television.
[02:23:23.280 --> 02:23:27.480]   People still watch broadcast TV there because of it.
[02:23:27.480 --> 02:23:31.720]   And here in the US, public television has been eviscerated.
[02:23:31.720 --> 02:23:33.120]   And--
[02:23:33.120 --> 02:23:34.640]   It runs everything but commercials.
[02:23:34.640 --> 02:23:37.040]   And constant pledge breaks.
[02:23:37.040 --> 02:23:41.680]   But the good news is there's such a diversity and a rich
[02:23:41.680 --> 02:23:45.160]   ecosystem of streaming stuff when you throw YouTube in, which
[02:23:45.160 --> 02:23:46.880]   is streaming, that there's--
[02:23:46.880 --> 02:23:48.280]   I don't think we need public TV.
[02:23:48.280 --> 02:23:48.880]   We've got--
[02:23:48.880 --> 02:23:51.520]   Anybody who wants us to do something can't do it.
[02:23:51.520 --> 02:23:54.800]   Although it's fascinating to listen to the kind of--
[02:23:54.800 --> 02:23:58.920]   And you guys included the media ecosystem talk about the
[02:23:58.920 --> 02:24:02.560]   different streaming services that are available.
[02:24:02.560 --> 02:24:05.000]   One of the films that I was really keen to watch in the last
[02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:06.640]   few weeks has been "Pray."
[02:24:06.640 --> 02:24:07.720]   Yeah, what a good movie.
[02:24:07.720 --> 02:24:08.800]   It's a pretty cool director.
[02:24:08.800 --> 02:24:09.800]   It's a pretty cool director.
[02:24:09.800 --> 02:24:12.440]   It's a friend of the show, Dan Tractenberg, right?
[02:24:12.440 --> 02:24:15.800]   Which is a Hulu streaming original.
[02:24:15.800 --> 02:24:20.160]   And then you go, oh, Hulu doesn't exist outside of the
[02:24:20.160 --> 02:24:21.000]   United States.
[02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:23.280]   In the United States, it's a Disney+ original.
[02:24:23.280 --> 02:24:24.680]   In the United Kingdom, it's a Disney+
[02:24:24.680 --> 02:24:26.760]   original.
[02:24:26.760 --> 02:24:30.360]   And you realize how much of the sort of conversation is based
[02:24:30.360 --> 02:24:34.920]   on one market being the US.
[02:24:34.920 --> 02:24:37.600]   And we talk about the cable infrastructure and the
[02:24:37.600 --> 02:24:39.080]   advertising infrastructure.
[02:24:39.080 --> 02:24:42.280]   Actually, that is just one market.
[02:24:42.280 --> 02:24:44.120]   And actually, the rest of the world doesn't operate in
[02:24:44.120 --> 02:24:45.560]   quite the same way.
[02:24:45.560 --> 02:24:46.560]   We don't even know.
[02:24:46.560 --> 02:24:47.320]   I don't know.
[02:24:47.320 --> 02:24:49.680]   And I imagine most viewers don't know.
[02:24:49.680 --> 02:24:51.640]   Did "Pray" made us a movie?
[02:24:51.640 --> 02:24:52.880]   Was it made for a network?
[02:24:52.880 --> 02:24:54.040]   Was it made just for who?
[02:24:54.040 --> 02:24:55.920]   I think it was made just for Hulu, right?
[02:24:55.920 --> 02:24:57.760]   No, so it's an incredible story.
[02:24:57.760 --> 02:25:04.520]   It was a Fox picture which was due to go to cinemas,
[02:25:04.520 --> 02:25:06.840]   theatres, as you would say.
[02:25:06.840 --> 02:25:07.720]   Oh, you mean movie?
[02:25:07.720 --> 02:25:09.400]   "Mulvey Power"s is yeah.
[02:25:09.400 --> 02:25:11.640]   "Mulvey Power"s is?
[02:25:11.640 --> 02:25:17.800]   And then when Disney bought Fox, Fox had a deal whereby
[02:25:17.800 --> 02:25:21.240]   anything that went to theatres would then first
[02:25:21.240 --> 02:25:23.560]   streaming rights go to Netflix.
[02:25:23.560 --> 02:25:24.280]   Right.
[02:25:24.280 --> 02:25:26.520]   And so rather than put it in theatres and have the
[02:25:26.520 --> 02:25:29.720]   streaming rights go to Netflix, they chose to
[02:25:29.720 --> 02:25:32.520]   stream it on Hulu as first run.
[02:25:32.520 --> 02:25:35.640]   I have never seen a Predator movie before.
[02:25:35.640 --> 02:25:36.680]   I'm ashamed to admit.
[02:25:36.680 --> 02:25:37.160]   John's.
[02:25:37.160 --> 02:25:37.720]   Really?
[02:25:37.720 --> 02:25:37.960]   Don't be ashamed.
[02:25:37.960 --> 02:25:39.400]   Get to the chopper!
[02:25:39.400 --> 02:25:40.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:25:40.760 --> 02:25:44.840]   John, something that said "Pray is great."
[02:25:44.840 --> 02:25:46.520]   I said, "I've never seen a Predator movie."
[02:25:46.520 --> 02:25:49.000]   He says, "Okay, you'll understand it's an alien and
[02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:51.160]   they got to kill it before it kills them."
[02:25:51.160 --> 02:25:52.600]   And I loved it.
[02:25:52.600 --> 02:25:56.200]   What I loved was the Native American angle on it.
[02:25:56.200 --> 02:25:58.040]   Well, and there's an entire version of the movie
[02:25:58.040 --> 02:25:59.000]   that's in Comanche.
[02:25:59.000 --> 02:25:59.400]   Yeah.
[02:25:59.400 --> 02:26:00.440]   Yeah.
[02:26:00.440 --> 02:26:01.240]   That's wild.
[02:26:01.240 --> 02:26:03.800]   And you get to watch it without a little posturing
[02:26:03.800 --> 02:26:05.480]   of Predator, which was kind of--
[02:26:05.480 --> 02:26:07.160]   Yes, I thought all about that.
[02:26:07.160 --> 02:26:08.440]   I was not down for that.
[02:26:08.440 --> 02:26:10.360]   Between him and the other leads, it was just grim.
[02:26:10.360 --> 02:26:10.760]   Yeah.
[02:26:10.760 --> 02:26:13.640]   You know, and it's our old friend, Dan Trachtenberg
[02:26:13.640 --> 02:26:16.440]   of "Totally Rad" with Alex Allbrecht and Jeff Kanada.
[02:26:16.440 --> 02:26:18.840]   So it's a little homegrown production.
[02:26:18.840 --> 02:26:19.320]   It's kind of neat.
[02:26:19.320 --> 02:26:20.760]   He's doing good.
[02:26:20.760 --> 02:26:21.760]   It's a good show.
[02:26:21.760 --> 02:26:23.160]   What was the budget on this?
[02:26:23.160 --> 02:26:26.600]   $50, $53.22.
[02:26:26.600 --> 02:26:27.880]   I actually watched the budget.
[02:26:27.880 --> 02:26:30.120]   I think the budget was my seven-parents' 99,
[02:26:30.120 --> 02:26:31.880]   and I pay them for Disney class.
[02:26:31.880 --> 02:26:34.680]   I watched the making of it.
[02:26:34.680 --> 02:26:38.120]   It's very cool, but yeah, I don't think it was a big budget film.
[02:26:38.120 --> 02:26:39.400]   I mean, mostly they made it--
[02:26:39.400 --> 02:26:43.400]   It was quite chunky, because it was going to be a proper
[02:26:43.400 --> 02:26:46.600]   Fox picture before Disney picked it up.
[02:26:46.600 --> 02:26:47.240]   I'm glad it aired.
[02:26:47.240 --> 02:26:49.720]   It's well worth a watch if anybody's watching it.
[02:26:49.720 --> 02:26:53.720]   Even if you've never seen a predator movie, it's quite good.
[02:26:53.720 --> 02:26:54.440]   Yeah.
[02:26:54.440 --> 02:26:54.920]   Like the--
[02:26:54.920 --> 02:26:55.960]   You won't like it, Becky.
[02:26:55.960 --> 02:26:57.000]   It's very silent.
[02:26:57.000 --> 02:26:57.480]   You won't.
[02:26:57.480 --> 02:26:59.000]   Well, I liked the predator movies.
[02:26:59.000 --> 02:26:59.640]   They were good.
[02:26:59.640 --> 02:27:01.400]   So much bicep.
[02:27:01.400 --> 02:27:02.680]   There's no bicep in this.
[02:27:02.680 --> 02:27:05.080]   Our hero is a Native American girl.
[02:27:05.080 --> 02:27:06.120]   Carl Withers.
[02:27:06.120 --> 02:27:07.320]   Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[02:27:07.320 --> 02:27:08.360]   No bicep.
[02:27:08.360 --> 02:27:09.240]   Get the guns out.
[02:27:09.240 --> 02:27:12.200]   Actually, predator is the best-looking guy in the whole show.
[02:27:12.200 --> 02:27:14.200]   Well, he's got that kudie catcher mouth, right?
[02:27:14.200 --> 02:27:15.000]   Yeah, that's a little bad.
[02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:17.560]   That's off-putting, but he's got six-back.
[02:27:17.560 --> 02:27:19.240]   Actually, he's got like a 12-back,
[02:27:19.240 --> 02:27:20.840]   because he's an alien.
[02:27:20.840 --> 02:27:23.480]   Hey, you know, Rod, I wanted to circle back to your question
[02:27:23.480 --> 02:27:24.760]   about all these derivative works,
[02:27:24.760 --> 02:27:26.520]   and how all these prequels, and sequels,
[02:27:26.520 --> 02:27:28.120]   and everything like that, and how can they
[02:27:28.120 --> 02:27:30.120]   continue to monetize these.
[02:27:30.120 --> 02:27:33.000]   And one interesting thing that I actually learned
[02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:35.720]   in grad school was when blues clues,
[02:27:35.720 --> 02:27:37.080]   the kids show first came out.
[02:27:37.080 --> 02:27:37.640]   Great show.
[02:27:37.640 --> 02:27:38.120]   Yeah.
[02:27:38.120 --> 02:27:40.600]   They only had enough money on PBS
[02:27:40.600 --> 02:27:42.840]   to make one episode a week, but the time slot
[02:27:42.840 --> 02:27:44.920]   was for five episodes a week.
[02:27:44.920 --> 02:27:47.240]   And they decided, OK, we're just going to air it
[02:27:47.240 --> 02:27:48.520]   and know that on Monday, we're going
[02:27:48.520 --> 02:27:51.080]   to get the big ratings, and then the kids will turn in,
[02:27:51.080 --> 02:27:53.000]   tune in on Tuesday, and realize, oh, I've already
[02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:55.080]   seen this one, and the ratings will gradually go down
[02:27:55.080 --> 02:27:56.680]   as the week progresses.
[02:27:56.680 --> 02:27:59.080]   The exact opposite happened.
[02:27:59.080 --> 02:28:00.600]   The kids watched on Monday.
[02:28:00.600 --> 02:28:03.880]   They tuned in on Tuesday and said, oh, I know this.
[02:28:03.880 --> 02:28:04.920]   Watched it.
[02:28:04.920 --> 02:28:07.320]   And then they wanted to come back again on Wednesday,
[02:28:07.320 --> 02:28:10.280]   because they wanted something predictable,
[02:28:10.280 --> 02:28:12.680]   something they knew the template of.
[02:28:12.680 --> 02:28:13.560]   Right.
[02:28:13.560 --> 02:28:15.320]   The world was so chaotic.
[02:28:15.320 --> 02:28:16.040]   Yeah.
[02:28:16.040 --> 02:28:18.760]   And they could predict how the storyline was going to end.
[02:28:18.760 --> 02:28:21.560]   So actually, Friday had the highest ratings.
[02:28:21.560 --> 02:28:23.680]   And I kind of have this hypothesis
[02:28:23.680 --> 02:28:25.760]   that in the world we live in now,
[02:28:25.760 --> 02:28:29.040]   it's really nice to watch a show that's kind of new,
[02:28:29.040 --> 02:28:31.240]   but you basically know what's going to happen.
[02:28:31.240 --> 02:28:31.880]   Because a bunch of--
[02:28:31.880 --> 02:28:32.400]   That's a good idea.
[02:28:32.400 --> 02:28:33.400]   That's a really-- that's so interesting.
[02:28:33.400 --> 02:28:35.520]   That's taking notes from what she just said.
[02:28:35.520 --> 02:28:38.640]   So what I want to know-- and this is stepping back a bit--
[02:28:38.640 --> 02:28:42.640]   but anybody here a top gear fan, the original BBC show?
[02:28:42.640 --> 02:28:43.160]   Yep.
[02:28:43.160 --> 02:28:47.600]   How did that become the most watch highest grossing film
[02:28:47.600 --> 02:28:51.920]   in the show, in the English language, for a decade?
[02:28:51.920 --> 02:28:55.560]   It's three fat middle-aged guys blowing up cars.
[02:28:55.560 --> 02:28:57.040]   I mean, I want to know that secret.
[02:28:57.040 --> 02:28:58.000]   I'm past middle-aged.
[02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:00.600]   But I mean, it sounds really like a great idea.
[02:29:00.600 --> 02:29:02.800]   Same recipe, different ingredients.
[02:29:02.800 --> 02:29:04.120]   I love it, but I still don't understand it.
[02:29:04.120 --> 02:29:05.680]   It's the same show over and over.
[02:29:05.680 --> 02:29:06.840]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:29:06.840 --> 02:29:09.560]   So there were-- I mean, there were not
[02:29:09.560 --> 02:29:13.920]   to take this show on too much of a rat hole.
[02:29:13.920 --> 02:29:19.760]   But there are two answers, which is one,
[02:29:19.760 --> 02:29:22.360]   every middle-aged man wishes they could hang out
[02:29:22.360 --> 02:29:23.040]   with all those--
[02:29:23.040 --> 02:29:24.200]   They all want to be Jeremy.
[02:29:24.200 --> 02:29:25.200]   We all want to be Jeremy.
[02:29:25.200 --> 02:29:26.040]   That's your question.
[02:29:26.040 --> 02:29:27.240]   They don't want to be that person,
[02:29:27.240 --> 02:29:29.760]   but you want to be able to hang out with those people.
[02:29:29.760 --> 02:29:31.800]   And two is the familiarity of it's
[02:29:31.800 --> 02:29:34.280]   a show every week that's not about cars.
[02:29:34.280 --> 02:29:36.280]   It's about friendship.
[02:29:36.280 --> 02:29:37.040]   Yes.
[02:29:37.040 --> 02:29:37.760]   To Becky's been--
[02:29:37.760 --> 02:29:39.080]   Wow.
[02:29:39.080 --> 02:29:40.280]   One of the right to the heart.
[02:29:40.280 --> 02:29:40.880]   It's a hot--
[02:29:40.880 --> 02:29:41.840]   It's hot.
[02:29:41.840 --> 02:29:45.200]   One of the hot shows right now that I am absolutely obsessed
[02:29:45.200 --> 02:29:49.160]   with, which a lot of my dad friends have clued me into,
[02:29:49.160 --> 02:29:54.800]   is Bluey, which if you haven't watched Bluey, holy smokes.
[02:29:54.800 --> 02:29:57.280]   It is one of the greatest shows on television.
[02:29:57.280 --> 02:29:58.520]   It's Australian.
[02:29:58.520 --> 02:29:59.640]   It's a cartoon.
[02:29:59.640 --> 02:30:04.440]   It's about a little family of two parents and two kids.
[02:30:04.440 --> 02:30:09.680]   And every show is seven to nine minutes.
[02:30:09.680 --> 02:30:14.920]   And you will learn something you will laugh, you will cry.
[02:30:14.920 --> 02:30:18.520]   It will-- whether or not you have kids, it doesn't matter.
[02:30:18.520 --> 02:30:24.560]   It's got that wonderful sort of aesthetic of kids watching
[02:30:24.560 --> 02:30:26.960]   it will get the very textual text,
[02:30:26.960 --> 02:30:29.840]   and the parents watching it will get the supertext
[02:30:29.840 --> 02:30:31.080]   and subtext.
[02:30:31.080 --> 02:30:32.120]   The weird thing is--
[02:30:32.120 --> 02:30:34.080]   You don't even have kids in your watches.
[02:30:34.080 --> 02:30:35.000]   You're watching this show.
[02:30:35.000 --> 02:30:35.800]   It's kind of amazing.
[02:30:35.800 --> 02:30:36.720]   Oh my word.
[02:30:36.720 --> 02:30:37.440]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:30:37.440 --> 02:30:39.640]   So all my dad friends are saying,
[02:30:39.640 --> 02:30:41.160]   this is the best thing that they're watching,
[02:30:41.160 --> 02:30:42.320]   whether or not they've got kids.
[02:30:42.320 --> 02:30:43.960]   So I thought, well, I have to watch it.
[02:30:43.960 --> 02:30:45.760]   And it's, yeah, somebody who doesn't have kids,
[02:30:45.760 --> 02:30:47.200]   you're watching it going, this is fun.
[02:30:47.200 --> 02:30:48.880]   OK, tell the truth.
[02:30:48.880 --> 02:30:52.440]   How many glasses of Irish whiskey in are you
[02:30:52.440 --> 02:30:55.400]   when you're watching this?
[02:30:55.400 --> 02:30:57.840]   No, no, the chat room agrees with him.
[02:30:57.840 --> 02:30:59.360]   Chum Lee in the chat room says,
[02:30:59.360 --> 02:31:01.160]   "Kaiyu needs a beat down with a rubber hose,
[02:31:01.160 --> 02:31:03.400]   but Bluey is life."
[02:31:03.400 --> 02:31:05.240]   "Kaiyu, my ring is amazing."
[02:31:05.240 --> 02:31:06.600]   I've never seen it so--
[02:31:06.600 --> 02:31:07.880]   I don't know if I would enjoy it.
[02:31:07.880 --> 02:31:08.880]   Did you?
[02:31:08.880 --> 02:31:09.720]   Did you?
[02:31:09.720 --> 02:31:10.560]   About Bluey?
[02:31:10.560 --> 02:31:11.560]   Well, he has a little kid.
[02:31:11.560 --> 02:31:13.120]   He knows, yeah, yeah.
[02:31:13.120 --> 02:31:14.560]   Our kids are almost the same age.
[02:31:14.560 --> 02:31:17.520]   Did you get into the first two seasons of SpongeBob?
[02:31:17.520 --> 02:31:18.360]   No.
[02:31:18.360 --> 02:31:21.560]   I had never done LSD, but it was as close to LSD
[02:31:21.560 --> 02:31:24.320]   watching television as I can imagine.
[02:31:24.320 --> 02:31:25.560]   But it was brilliant.
[02:31:25.560 --> 02:31:27.360]   Well, and then the network step then
[02:31:27.360 --> 02:31:28.480]   took control of our--
[02:31:28.480 --> 02:31:32.280]   One of our hosts here on the network's wife
[02:31:32.280 --> 02:31:36.040]   is starring in the stage play of SpongeBob.
[02:31:36.040 --> 02:31:37.640]   Oh, no.
[02:31:37.640 --> 02:31:40.840]   You're in Petaluma, and we are all going to see it, Anne.
[02:31:40.840 --> 02:31:43.280]   I hope you know, Queen Pruitt is going to have
[02:31:43.280 --> 02:31:48.040]   a applauding audience, a clack in there, cheering her on.
[02:31:48.040 --> 02:31:48.880]   Can I do a--
[02:31:48.880 --> 02:31:50.320]   What character does she play?
[02:31:50.320 --> 02:31:51.760]   Sandy Cheeks.
[02:31:51.760 --> 02:31:52.520]   Sandy Cheeks.
[02:31:52.520 --> 02:31:53.680]   Woo, yeah.
[02:31:53.680 --> 02:31:54.520]   Pretty good role.
[02:31:54.520 --> 02:31:55.360]   That's a good role.
[02:31:55.360 --> 02:31:56.200]   That is a good role.
[02:31:56.200 --> 02:31:57.040]   I don't know.
[02:31:57.040 --> 02:31:57.880]   I've never--
[02:31:57.880 --> 02:31:58.720]   We like Sandy Cheeks.
[02:31:58.720 --> 02:31:59.220]   OK.
[02:31:59.220 --> 02:32:00.040]   Oh, we do.
[02:32:00.040 --> 02:32:00.880]   Don't get stuck.
[02:32:00.880 --> 02:32:01.380]   We do.
[02:32:01.380 --> 02:32:03.080]   We do.
[02:32:03.080 --> 02:32:05.040]   Becky and I are saying, we're glad our kids are grown.
[02:32:05.040 --> 02:32:07.380]   We don't have to watch anymore Barney.
[02:32:07.380 --> 02:32:08.800]   Oh, my god.
[02:32:08.800 --> 02:32:09.680]   Oh, my god.
[02:32:09.680 --> 02:32:11.880]   You're my special Leo.
[02:32:11.880 --> 02:32:14.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:32:14.600 --> 02:32:15.640]   All right.
[02:32:15.640 --> 02:32:16.440]   We got to take a break.
[02:32:16.440 --> 02:32:17.480]   We're going way over time.
[02:32:17.480 --> 02:32:18.360]   I got to take a break.
[02:32:18.360 --> 02:32:19.040]   We will come back.
[02:32:19.040 --> 02:32:20.120]   We'll talk more.
[02:32:20.120 --> 02:32:22.520]   Wrap this thing up, because what a great panel with Becky
[02:32:22.520 --> 02:32:25.120]   Warley and Rod Pyle and Will Harris.
[02:32:25.120 --> 02:32:27.160]   You guys are my best friends, man.
[02:32:27.160 --> 02:32:28.120]   Straight from the heart.
[02:32:28.120 --> 02:32:28.960]   That's what this show is.
[02:32:28.960 --> 02:32:30.560]   A bunch of friends getting together.
[02:32:30.560 --> 02:32:31.740]   Talking about cars.
[02:32:31.740 --> 02:32:32.760]   It's the top gear of tech.
[02:32:32.760 --> 02:32:33.260]   Is that--
[02:32:33.260 --> 02:32:35.460]   Top gear tech.
[02:32:35.460 --> 02:32:38.540]   One of the ways we bring this show to you, ever since day one
[02:32:38.540 --> 02:32:41.840]   when we started shooting video was with our new tech
[02:32:41.840 --> 02:32:45.940]   Tri-Caster 2 Elite, the most complete live production
[02:32:45.940 --> 02:32:47.180]   system on the planet.
[02:32:47.180 --> 02:32:51.260]   And what an empowering technology for us as podcasters.
[02:32:51.260 --> 02:32:53.900]   When we first started video, I said, well, how am I going
[02:32:53.900 --> 02:32:55.380]   to switch it?
[02:32:55.380 --> 02:32:57.220]   What am I going to do?
[02:32:57.220 --> 02:33:02.140]   When we were at Tech TV, Becky, we had $2 million control rooms
[02:33:02.140 --> 02:33:03.640]   with Grass Valley switchers.
[02:33:03.640 --> 02:33:07.700]   And we had very, very expensive cameras and all of that.
[02:33:07.700 --> 02:33:11.140]   The Tri-Caster 2 Elite, any Tri-Caster products
[02:33:11.140 --> 02:33:15.940]   allowed me to do with Twitch for a fraction of the cost better,
[02:33:15.940 --> 02:33:19.140]   better than Tech TV ever did.
[02:33:19.140 --> 02:33:22.780]   It's actually more than just a live video production system.
[02:33:22.780 --> 02:33:26.060]   It's an all-encompassing digital media solution
[02:33:26.060 --> 02:33:29.020]   that lets us create content and you create content for the internet,
[02:33:29.020 --> 02:33:32.260]   for mobile-- yeah, even TV now uses new tech.
[02:33:32.260 --> 02:33:34.860]   Late in 2001, New Tech unleashed an updated version
[02:33:34.860 --> 02:33:38.620]   of the Tri-Caster 2 Elite with lots of new features.
[02:33:38.620 --> 02:33:42.260]   The live call connect feature, which means you can call in--
[02:33:42.260 --> 02:33:45.460]   we're going to actually-- I think maybe that's what we need to do.
[02:33:45.460 --> 02:33:48.740]   We're going to launch a new show in January with call ins.
[02:33:48.740 --> 02:33:51.020]   And I think that might be the solution.
[02:33:51.020 --> 02:33:53.940]   It now supports Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, and FaceTime
[02:33:53.940 --> 02:33:56.380]   as inputs to any production.
[02:33:56.380 --> 02:33:58.220]   Selectable audio and video returns
[02:33:58.220 --> 02:34:00.540]   enable the Tri-Caster 2 Elite operators
[02:34:00.540 --> 02:34:03.100]   to view an audio return like any other output, which
[02:34:03.100 --> 02:34:04.620]   means it's so much more flexible.
[02:34:04.620 --> 02:34:06.420]   Benito is the king of the Tri-Caster, right?
[02:34:06.420 --> 02:34:08.580]   Benito, you understand all this stuff.
[02:34:08.580 --> 02:34:12.220]   It's a mystery to me, but our technical directors love it.
[02:34:12.220 --> 02:34:16.180]   The all-new Neural Voice Isolation Tool, which cleans audio,
[02:34:16.180 --> 02:34:20.340]   uses AI to cancel or reduce background noise automatically
[02:34:20.340 --> 02:34:23.900]   detects voices and says, the rest of it throw it out.
[02:34:23.900 --> 02:34:26.380]   Audio is so important to video.
[02:34:26.380 --> 02:34:29.060]   And you know, I love it that the folks at New Tech
[02:34:29.060 --> 02:34:30.620]   understand that.
[02:34:30.620 --> 02:34:36.540]   You get increased power flexibility and simplicity.
[02:34:36.540 --> 02:34:38.100]   We use the macros like crazy.
[02:34:38.100 --> 02:34:42.060]   Now they support variables, which is really kind of cool.
[02:34:42.060 --> 02:34:44.500]   It's like becoming a programming system.
[02:34:44.500 --> 02:34:46.700]   The system offers dynamic and powerful tools
[02:34:46.700 --> 02:34:48.540]   to allow operators to nest macros,
[02:34:48.540 --> 02:34:51.260]   to deliver complex productions more easily.
[02:34:51.260 --> 02:34:55.820]   You could encode up to three channels all the same time.
[02:34:55.820 --> 02:34:58.580]   They've got the live panel builder now in the Tri-Caster,
[02:34:58.580 --> 02:35:01.700]   meaning users can create bespoke user interfaces,
[02:35:01.700 --> 02:35:04.580]   customize the presets within the user interface,
[02:35:04.580 --> 02:35:07.540]   making your distributed workflows simpler, more cohesive
[02:35:07.540 --> 02:35:09.420]   without compromising on quality.
[02:35:09.420 --> 02:35:12.580]   The NDI Genlock 2, by the way, really is important.
[02:35:12.580 --> 02:35:15.340]   And that's a new feature in the Tri-Caster 2 Elite,
[02:35:15.340 --> 02:35:19.180]   which allows you to match outputs to a common sync pulse.
[02:35:19.180 --> 02:35:21.820]   Perfect for remote workflows, operators can now send alpha
[02:35:21.820 --> 02:35:23.420]   channel through one of the mix outs.
[02:35:23.420 --> 02:35:25.780]   I mean, I can go on and on.
[02:35:25.780 --> 02:35:28.860]   It is really an impressive tool.
[02:35:28.860 --> 02:35:30.860]   Operators can see the resolution and frame rate
[02:35:30.860 --> 02:35:33.540]   of every video source coming into the Tri-Caster.
[02:35:33.540 --> 02:35:36.220]   So you know exactly before you put it on the air,
[02:35:36.220 --> 02:35:38.260]   what you're going to get.
[02:35:38.260 --> 02:35:40.780]   Since its arrival in 2020, Tri-Caster 2 Elite
[02:35:40.780 --> 02:35:44.380]   has offered incredibly powerful live production systems
[02:35:44.380 --> 02:35:48.140]   to people in every area of video.
[02:35:48.140 --> 02:35:51.460]   I know so many churches and schools, broadcasters
[02:35:51.460 --> 02:35:52.940]   who use Tri-Caster.
[02:35:52.940 --> 02:35:54.500]   It's transformative.
[02:35:54.500 --> 02:35:57.860]   The Tri-Caster 1 Pro, also an excellent choice
[02:35:57.860 --> 02:36:01.460]   for producers, content creators and publishers.
[02:36:01.460 --> 02:36:04.700]   It has live call connect support for 4K, UHD streaming,
[02:36:04.700 --> 02:36:05.540]   live streaming.
[02:36:05.540 --> 02:36:09.380]   It's kind of amazing what we can do these days.
[02:36:09.380 --> 02:36:10.940]   There's a whole Tri-Caster family.
[02:36:10.940 --> 02:36:12.900]   The best thing to do, visit the website,
[02:36:12.900 --> 02:36:18.060]   go.newtech.com/twit-tv, where you'll find it easy
[02:36:18.060 --> 02:36:19.820]   to use interactive guide that offers advice
[02:36:19.820 --> 02:36:22.020]   on which Tri-Caster is right for you.
[02:36:22.020 --> 02:36:24.860]   That's what got us started many years ago.
[02:36:24.860 --> 02:36:28.260]   And it's what keeps us on the air every single day.
[02:36:28.260 --> 02:36:33.900]   Go.newtech, N-E-W-T-E-K.com/twit-tv.
[02:36:33.900 --> 02:36:36.420]   A real tip of the hat to New Tech for that technology
[02:36:36.420 --> 02:36:37.860]   has been so important for us.
[02:36:37.860 --> 02:36:39.660]   Thank you, New Tech.
[02:36:39.660 --> 02:36:40.700]   We appreciate it.
[02:36:40.700 --> 02:36:44.060]   We were shooting Becky in SD, right?
[02:36:44.060 --> 02:36:45.620]   I mean, that wasn't high-def even
[02:36:45.620 --> 02:36:47.220]   that we were doing tech TV.
[02:36:47.220 --> 02:36:49.740]   4x3, it was old school.
[02:36:49.740 --> 02:36:51.380]   It's amazing.
[02:36:51.380 --> 02:36:54.380]   Resolution was low, especially that time
[02:36:54.380 --> 02:36:57.060]   that you streaked the set of internet tonight.
[02:36:57.060 --> 02:37:00.660]   My goodness, you couldn't see a thing.
[02:37:00.660 --> 02:37:02.660]   I was moving far too fast.
[02:37:02.660 --> 02:37:08.660]   I think I was--
[02:37:08.660 --> 02:37:09.820]   You were wearing pants.
[02:37:09.820 --> 02:37:11.100]   You just had them down very low.
[02:37:11.100 --> 02:37:12.100]   Thank you.
[02:37:12.100 --> 02:37:13.300]   You had them down very low.
[02:37:13.300 --> 02:37:15.940]   Resolution was low, but the quality was high.
[02:37:15.940 --> 02:37:16.940]   Hi.
[02:37:16.940 --> 02:37:17.860]   Oh, Lord.
[02:37:17.860 --> 02:37:19.180]   Oh, Lord.
[02:37:19.180 --> 02:37:21.420]   Hey, take a look at some of the things we did this week
[02:37:21.420 --> 02:37:23.500]   using our New Tech Tri-Caster.
[02:37:23.500 --> 02:37:25.620]   Here's a best of for you.
[02:37:25.620 --> 02:37:25.980]   Why?
[02:37:25.980 --> 02:37:27.980]   Hey.
[02:37:27.980 --> 02:37:29.340]   What are you laughing at?
[02:37:29.340 --> 02:37:30.020]   Why?
[02:37:30.020 --> 02:37:31.340]   Why?
[02:37:31.340 --> 02:37:33.420]   It's time for the tech guy show.
[02:37:33.420 --> 02:37:36.060]   I thought I'd try something new, but I guess you don't like it.
[02:37:36.060 --> 02:37:38.140]   It felt a little odd.
[02:37:38.140 --> 02:37:39.620]   I'll say that.
[02:37:39.620 --> 02:37:41.500]   Yodelie.
[02:37:41.500 --> 02:37:45.140]   Previously on "Twit," iOS today.
[02:37:45.140 --> 02:37:47.340]   Rosemary Orchard is back, and we are
[02:37:47.340 --> 02:37:50.940]   talking about taking your devices offline.
[02:37:50.940 --> 02:37:53.180]   Yes, there are times when it is time
[02:37:53.180 --> 02:37:57.900]   to step away from the Wi-Fi, the cellular data, all about Android.
[02:37:57.900 --> 02:37:59.780]   It's a very important date happened for us,
[02:37:59.780 --> 02:38:02.860]   Android developers back in May 2017.
[02:38:02.860 --> 02:38:05.260]   This week, Google's celebrating it.
[02:38:05.260 --> 02:38:08.660]   They've got their hashtag high five, call it on Android.
[02:38:08.660 --> 02:38:11.940]   And they're just taking time to celebrate and look back
[02:38:11.940 --> 02:38:15.380]   on five years of having Kotlin be a first-party development
[02:38:15.380 --> 02:38:17.500]   language for Android.
[02:38:17.500 --> 02:38:18.980]   This week in Google.
[02:38:18.980 --> 02:38:22.060]   We all know about Dolly, too.
[02:38:22.060 --> 02:38:26.060]   Should we just do one podcast legend having lunch?
[02:38:26.060 --> 02:38:26.580]   That's good.
[02:38:26.580 --> 02:38:27.940]   I like it.
[02:38:27.940 --> 02:38:29.780]   Oh, here it is.
[02:38:29.780 --> 02:38:31.700]   Podcast legend having lunch.
[02:38:31.700 --> 02:38:36.700]   That awesome.
[02:38:36.700 --> 02:38:38.140]   Hey, I generated it.
[02:38:38.140 --> 02:38:39.860]   I think that's art.
[02:38:39.860 --> 02:38:41.740]   AI generated.
[02:38:41.740 --> 02:38:43.780]   Oh, you've been better.
[02:38:43.780 --> 02:38:44.260]   Yeah.
[02:38:44.260 --> 02:38:44.900]   Oh, my God.
[02:38:44.900 --> 02:38:47.140]   I love it.
[02:38:47.140 --> 02:38:47.860]   That's what it looks like.
[02:38:47.860 --> 02:38:49.780]   That's awesome.
[02:38:49.780 --> 02:38:50.460]   Look at this one.
[02:38:50.460 --> 02:38:52.620]   It looks like me and Joe Rogan having lunch.
[02:38:52.620 --> 02:38:53.860]   I love that.
[02:38:53.860 --> 02:38:55.180]   Did any of you--
[02:38:55.180 --> 02:38:59.860]   Speaking of Joe Rogan, listen to three hours of Joe Rogan
[02:38:59.860 --> 02:39:02.540]   interviewing Mark Zuckerberg, anybody?
[02:39:02.540 --> 02:39:03.420]   Show of hands?
[02:39:03.420 --> 02:39:03.820]   No.
[02:39:03.820 --> 02:39:04.300]   You missed it.
[02:39:04.300 --> 02:39:06.540]   You were in the Arctic.
[02:39:06.540 --> 02:39:07.100]   Was it great?
[02:39:08.100 --> 02:39:08.780]   I don't know.
[02:39:08.780 --> 02:39:10.380]   I didn't listen to it either.
[02:39:10.380 --> 02:39:16.860]   I have to go with the summaries published
[02:39:16.860 --> 02:39:18.900]   by some of the tech reporters who
[02:39:18.900 --> 02:39:22.380]   were willing to sit through three hours of it.
[02:39:22.380 --> 02:39:27.740]   Among other things, Mark said owning, being in charge of,
[02:39:27.740 --> 02:39:30.620]   meta means that he wakes up every morning.
[02:39:30.620 --> 02:39:33.780]   It's like being punched in the stomach.
[02:39:33.780 --> 02:39:34.540]   Poor Mark.
[02:39:34.540 --> 02:39:35.340]   Poor Mark.
[02:39:35.340 --> 02:39:37.420]   It sounds like the kind of work experience I want, right?
[02:39:37.420 --> 02:39:47.900]   He says that he'll wake up in the morning.
[02:39:47.900 --> 02:39:53.940]   And all of the messages that came in overnight,
[02:39:53.940 --> 02:39:57.660]   all of the problems that Facebook's facing come rushing
[02:39:57.660 --> 02:39:59.300]   back to him.
[02:39:59.300 --> 02:40:01.580]   And it's like being punched in the stomach.
[02:40:01.580 --> 02:40:02.660]   Then he clarified, by the way.
[02:40:02.660 --> 02:40:03.780]   He said, that's not bad.
[02:40:03.780 --> 02:40:07.420]   I'm really happy to be one of the wealthiest men in the world.
[02:40:07.420 --> 02:40:10.340]   I mean, the whole interview is basically
[02:40:10.340 --> 02:40:14.020]   is that classic Zuckerberg thing of saying lots
[02:40:14.020 --> 02:40:16.780]   without saying anything at all.
[02:40:16.780 --> 02:40:18.340]   If you read the--
[02:40:18.340 --> 02:40:20.500]   I'm going to be unashamedly British here
[02:40:20.500 --> 02:40:22.660]   and pick the BBC summary of the interview.
[02:40:22.660 --> 02:40:23.540]   Good idea.
[02:40:23.540 --> 02:40:28.220]   Zuckerberg said that getting the decision wrong, quote,
[02:40:28.220 --> 02:40:32.860]   sucks when we take something down that we're not supposed to.
[02:40:32.860 --> 02:40:33.740]   It's been like one.
[02:40:33.740 --> 02:40:36.060]   That's the worst.
[02:40:36.060 --> 02:40:37.500]   So this was something that they--
[02:40:37.500 --> 02:40:38.020]   Oh, wow.
[02:40:38.020 --> 02:40:39.460]   What an incredible insight.
[02:40:39.460 --> 02:40:41.020]   Thank you, Mark.
[02:40:41.020 --> 02:40:44.140]   And he says, depending on what side
[02:40:44.140 --> 02:40:46.620]   of the political spectrum you're on,
[02:40:46.620 --> 02:40:48.860]   you either think we didn't censor it enough
[02:40:48.860 --> 02:40:51.900]   or we censored it way too much.
[02:40:51.900 --> 02:40:52.980]   I mean, wow.
[02:40:52.980 --> 02:40:53.540]   Both are right.
[02:40:53.540 --> 02:40:54.340]   Both are right.
[02:40:54.340 --> 02:40:55.380]   The insight.
[02:40:55.380 --> 02:40:56.220]   The insight is--
[02:40:56.220 --> 02:40:57.900]   These are the highlights, too.
[02:40:57.900 --> 02:40:59.140]   I can't imagine the filler works.
[02:40:59.140 --> 02:41:01.940]   So the hurt to grow a conscience, is that what he's saying?
[02:41:01.940 --> 02:41:05.700]   This was about the Hunter Biden laptop story
[02:41:05.700 --> 02:41:09.060]   that was published in the New York Post, which Facebook
[02:41:09.060 --> 02:41:11.700]   and Mark admitted this did push down.
[02:41:11.700 --> 02:41:15.620]   They said, we didn't block it, but we lowered the temperature
[02:41:15.620 --> 02:41:16.460]   on it.
[02:41:16.460 --> 02:41:18.220]   And there was some--
[02:41:18.220 --> 02:41:20.820]   he mentioned that the FBI had contacted him.
[02:41:20.820 --> 02:41:22.020]   The FBI later clarified.
[02:41:22.020 --> 02:41:25.260]   They said, we are not allowed to, and we did not say to him,
[02:41:25.260 --> 02:41:27.100]   take down this story.
[02:41:27.100 --> 02:41:30.180]   In fact, we didn't even mention the Hunter Biden laptop story.
[02:41:30.180 --> 02:41:32.700]   We mentioned that there is misinformation
[02:41:32.700 --> 02:41:36.540]   from foreign actors showing up.
[02:41:36.540 --> 02:41:39.340]   And you might want to do something about that.
[02:41:39.340 --> 02:41:40.380]   We can't tell you what to do.
[02:41:40.380 --> 02:41:42.820]   You might want to do something about that.
[02:41:42.820 --> 02:41:44.660]   Also, he talks about--
[02:41:44.660 --> 02:41:48.780]   and I just love this because the irony of when
[02:41:48.780 --> 02:41:52.060]   you go back to the origins of Facebook is incredible.
[02:41:52.060 --> 02:41:54.420]   He talks about how it's difficult to deal
[02:41:54.420 --> 02:41:57.380]   with thorny issues around personal lives.
[02:41:57.380 --> 02:42:00.900]   And he says, I didn't get into this to basically judge
[02:42:00.900 --> 02:42:02.580]   these things.
[02:42:02.580 --> 02:42:05.060]   And you're like, didn't you get into this entirely to just
[02:42:05.060 --> 02:42:07.980]   judge women based on their appearance in the office?
[02:42:07.980 --> 02:42:08.500]   Or not.
[02:42:08.500 --> 02:42:09.500]   Not the entire point.
[02:42:09.500 --> 02:42:12.980]   You literally got into this to judge things.
[02:42:12.980 --> 02:42:14.460]   I didn't even think of that.
[02:42:14.460 --> 02:42:16.620]   That's a fellow boy.
[02:42:16.620 --> 02:42:20.420]   He also let us know that he's big in a mixed martial arts
[02:42:20.420 --> 02:42:22.420]   now, Jiu Jitsu.
[02:42:22.420 --> 02:42:24.460]   The whole family big in a Jiu Jitsu.
[02:42:24.460 --> 02:42:29.460]   Is he going to become another body freak like Bezos is?
[02:42:29.460 --> 02:42:32.340]   Is he done with the motorized foil?
[02:42:32.340 --> 02:42:33.700]   Is he done with that?
[02:42:33.700 --> 02:42:35.460]   No, no, no, big into that.
[02:42:35.460 --> 02:42:40.220]   He plans to do a lot more surfing and foiling.
[02:42:40.220 --> 02:42:41.780]   But he does say, Jiu Jitsu--
[02:42:41.780 --> 02:42:42.700]   and a lot more sun cream.
[02:42:42.700 --> 02:42:46.500]   He does say Jiu Jitsu is, quote, "a big part of who I am."
[02:42:46.500 --> 02:42:48.500]   Mm.
[02:42:48.500 --> 02:42:49.980]   OK, I guess I didn't miss anything.
[02:42:49.980 --> 02:42:53.700]   I literally, every day, since that interview,
[02:42:53.700 --> 02:42:55.060]   I've been getting up saying, you know,
[02:42:55.060 --> 02:42:59.780]   I really should listen to the Zuckerberg interview.
[02:42:59.780 --> 02:43:03.300]   And then you just realize he's one of the most powerful yet
[02:43:03.300 --> 02:43:05.700]   boring people on earth.
[02:43:05.700 --> 02:43:08.540]   So is he a boring communicator.
[02:43:08.540 --> 02:43:09.780]   He's a boring communicator.
[02:43:09.780 --> 02:43:10.300]   Yes.
[02:43:10.300 --> 02:43:11.700]   And I think it's important to distinguish
[02:43:11.700 --> 02:43:13.740]   that you can have a lot of brilliant people
[02:43:13.740 --> 02:43:17.820]   or a lot of powerful people who don't express themselves well.
[02:43:17.820 --> 02:43:19.100]   And he knows this about himself.
[02:43:19.100 --> 02:43:20.820]   I think back to that interview with Cara Swisher,
[02:43:20.820 --> 02:43:22.620]   where he just sweated his way through it.
[02:43:22.620 --> 02:43:24.180]   Oh, my God.
[02:43:24.180 --> 02:43:25.140]   Talk about Foxwood.
[02:43:25.140 --> 02:43:26.660]   I also think Becky-- Becky, to your point,
[02:43:26.660 --> 02:43:28.900]   I don't think that he doesn't express himself well.
[02:43:28.900 --> 02:43:32.780]   I think he chooses not to express himself.
[02:43:32.780 --> 02:43:33.140]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:43:33.140 --> 02:43:34.060]   He may be smart enough to sense--
[02:43:34.060 --> 02:43:35.780]   I think he's a very interesting person.
[02:43:35.780 --> 02:43:36.300]   Self-censored.
[02:43:36.300 --> 02:43:37.540]   That he just doesn't get himself out there.
[02:43:37.540 --> 02:43:38.500]   Yeah.
[02:43:38.500 --> 02:43:40.420]   Honestly, it's funny, because we began this show
[02:43:40.420 --> 02:43:43.660]   bemoning how expressive Elon Musk is.
[02:43:43.660 --> 02:43:44.180]   It's a little bit.
[02:43:44.180 --> 02:43:46.980]   How much he says too much.
[02:43:46.980 --> 02:43:49.500]   And now we're talking about Zuck and how little he says.
[02:43:49.500 --> 02:43:51.420]   You just can't win with us, I guess.
[02:43:51.420 --> 02:43:53.700]   But Elon probably had a girlfriend before he got rich,
[02:43:53.700 --> 02:43:56.060]   which might have made a difference.
[02:43:56.060 --> 02:43:57.780]   Having some sort of little experience.
[02:43:57.780 --> 02:43:58.820]   Let's correct that.
[02:43:58.820 --> 02:44:00.260]   Let's correct that right there.
[02:44:00.260 --> 02:44:00.740]   Sorry.
[02:44:00.740 --> 02:44:03.020]   The social network got it wrong.
[02:44:03.020 --> 02:44:07.100]   Zuck was with Priscilla Chan before Facebook.
[02:44:07.100 --> 02:44:08.380]   He ended up marrying her.
[02:44:08.380 --> 02:44:09.780]   He's still with her.
[02:44:09.780 --> 02:44:10.620]   They have kids.
[02:44:10.620 --> 02:44:11.380]   Well, who does to him?
[02:44:11.380 --> 02:44:11.580]   Yeah.
[02:44:11.580 --> 02:44:13.820]   No, he had a girlfriend then.
[02:44:13.820 --> 02:44:14.580]   That didn't stop him.
[02:44:14.580 --> 02:44:15.740]   She should have done more.
[02:44:15.740 --> 02:44:16.660]   Do we want to use--
[02:44:16.660 --> 02:44:19.620]   Look, somebody whose love life was a disaster before I got rich.
[02:44:19.620 --> 02:44:22.980]   I'm just not going to judge him the way.
[02:44:22.980 --> 02:44:23.500]   Come on.
[02:44:23.500 --> 02:44:24.540]   Guys, give me a break.
[02:44:24.540 --> 02:44:27.180]   California has announced it's banning
[02:44:27.180 --> 02:44:31.340]   the sale of new gasoline cars in 2035.
[02:44:31.340 --> 02:44:32.660]   I love this.
[02:44:32.660 --> 02:44:33.340]   I love that.
[02:44:33.340 --> 02:44:34.900]   Do you drive an electric vehicle, Ms. Woodley?
[02:44:34.900 --> 02:44:35.980]   I sure do.
[02:44:35.980 --> 02:44:37.380]   What do you drive?
[02:44:37.380 --> 02:44:40.300]   I have the Volvo XC40.
[02:44:40.300 --> 02:44:41.180]   It's small.
[02:44:41.180 --> 02:44:41.740]   Oh, nice.
[02:44:41.740 --> 02:44:42.100]   Pretty car.
[02:44:42.100 --> 02:44:42.980]   All electric.
[02:44:42.980 --> 02:44:43.060]   Love it.
[02:44:43.060 --> 02:44:43.820]   Love it.
[02:44:43.820 --> 02:44:44.860]   Love it.
[02:44:44.860 --> 02:44:46.060]   Not super expensive.
[02:44:46.060 --> 02:44:47.700]   I mean, they're all a little bit expensive.
[02:44:47.700 --> 02:44:49.340]   And you could get cheaper.
[02:44:49.340 --> 02:44:49.740]   You know what?
[02:44:49.740 --> 02:44:51.180]   Our Chevy Bolt, all electric?
[02:44:51.180 --> 02:44:51.660]   And C.
[02:44:51.660 --> 02:44:53.220]   $20,000 after--
[02:44:53.220 --> 02:44:54.260]   OK, that's a good price.
[02:44:54.260 --> 02:44:55.340]   So they aren't that expensive.
[02:44:55.340 --> 02:44:57.580]   We just don't have what it was five years ago, which is amazing.
[02:44:57.580 --> 02:45:00.420]   We bought it two years ago.
[02:45:00.420 --> 02:45:04.020]   And we got the $7,500 tax break, which is now back,
[02:45:04.020 --> 02:45:06.380]   but it was gone for a while.
[02:45:06.380 --> 02:45:08.940]   And I think there was a state $2,500 tax break.
[02:45:08.940 --> 02:45:10.900]   So I think it was $30,000.
[02:45:10.900 --> 02:45:14.180]   But after we paid for it, it was ended up being $20,000 in breaks.
[02:45:14.180 --> 02:45:17.860]   That's not-- out of people's reach.
[02:45:17.860 --> 02:45:19.940]   And it's a great EV.
[02:45:19.940 --> 02:45:24.180]   I drive a Mustang Mach-E that we gave the Bolt to our sudden 19
[02:45:24.180 --> 02:45:25.380]   year old.
[02:45:25.380 --> 02:45:28.620]   And Lisa has an electric Mini.
[02:45:28.620 --> 02:45:30.980]   So you think it's a good thing, Becky?
[02:45:30.980 --> 02:45:34.060]   Well, I also want the Ford F-150, but the SUV version,
[02:45:34.060 --> 02:45:36.580]   they have the lightning right now, which I would like to have,
[02:45:36.580 --> 02:45:37.620]   but I schlep kids.
[02:45:37.620 --> 02:45:40.380]   And so anything to get rid of my Mini Limo,
[02:45:40.380 --> 02:45:43.780]   so sick of my Mini Van.
[02:45:43.780 --> 02:45:44.500]   God.
[02:45:44.500 --> 02:45:45.300]   You know what I want?
[02:45:45.300 --> 02:45:47.700]   The VW Buzz.
[02:45:47.700 --> 02:45:49.100]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:45:49.100 --> 02:45:50.580]   That would be good for a little family.
[02:45:50.580 --> 02:45:55.300]   Yeah, it's the old VW Buzz in electric form.
[02:45:55.300 --> 02:45:57.220]   So yes, I think it's a really good thing.
[02:45:57.220 --> 02:46:00.460]   And I go back to the California Air Resources Board,
[02:46:00.460 --> 02:46:03.780]   changing the world with their emission standards back
[02:46:03.780 --> 02:46:06.980]   in the early 2000s when they set the emission standards
[02:46:06.980 --> 02:46:07.740]   for California.
[02:46:07.740 --> 02:46:10.940]   And as California goes, so goes the country.
[02:46:10.940 --> 02:46:13.780]   And hopefully, we--
[02:46:13.780 --> 02:46:16.140]   if the country doesn't have the will to do it,
[02:46:16.140 --> 02:46:18.580]   California is big enough to have an impact.
[02:46:18.580 --> 02:46:22.540]   And so I see this as hugely positive.
[02:46:22.540 --> 02:46:25.060]   I know the good news is it's only as--
[02:46:25.060 --> 02:46:28.180]   the obvious thing is it's new electric cars.
[02:46:28.180 --> 02:46:30.260]   That's what must be sold in California.
[02:46:30.260 --> 02:46:34.900]   And it corresponds with 2035 is when GM says all their cars
[02:46:34.900 --> 02:46:36.420]   will be electric.
[02:46:36.420 --> 02:46:39.020]   And that gives time for the infrastructure,
[02:46:39.020 --> 02:46:41.100]   the charging infrastructure to come in.
[02:46:41.100 --> 02:46:43.020]   And I think people will get much more comfortable
[02:46:43.020 --> 02:46:46.540]   with range anxiety and realizing, I actually don't drive 300
[02:46:46.540 --> 02:46:48.020]   miles very often.
[02:46:48.020 --> 02:46:51.140]   And by then, hopefully, you'll have fast charge stations.
[02:46:51.140 --> 02:46:51.940]   Nice.
[02:46:51.940 --> 02:46:59.300]   Here's our operations guy in his Ford Lightning.
[02:46:59.300 --> 02:46:59.780]   Yeah.
[02:46:59.780 --> 02:47:00.380]   It was his plate.
[02:47:00.380 --> 02:47:01.580]   Howdy, y'all.
[02:47:01.580 --> 02:47:03.060]   Could tell he's from Texas.
[02:47:03.060 --> 02:47:04.900]   Howdy, here I come.
[02:47:04.900 --> 02:47:06.060]   Am I landing?
[02:47:06.060 --> 02:47:07.620]   Oh, I want that.
[02:47:07.620 --> 02:47:08.100]   Isn't that nice?
[02:47:08.100 --> 02:47:09.500]   I love a truck.
[02:47:09.500 --> 02:47:12.700]   Now, you know what I'm waiting for us to do in California
[02:47:12.700 --> 02:47:15.140]   is to ban gas powered leaf blowers.
[02:47:15.140 --> 02:47:16.340]   Oh, God, please.
[02:47:16.340 --> 02:47:17.260]   That's what we need to get back.
[02:47:17.260 --> 02:47:18.300]   Please.
[02:47:18.300 --> 02:47:20.100]   And not only is it a noise pollution,
[02:47:20.100 --> 02:47:26.500]   but a leaf blower has more carbon dioxide emissions,
[02:47:26.500 --> 02:47:30.300]   pollutants than a 2010--
[02:47:30.300 --> 02:47:30.900]   Yes.
[02:47:30.900 --> 02:47:31.900]   --like F-150.
[02:47:31.900 --> 02:47:32.940]   Yeah, they're still two strokes.
[02:47:32.940 --> 02:47:33.820]   They're two strokes.
[02:47:33.820 --> 02:47:34.300]   Yeah.
[02:47:34.300 --> 02:47:35.220]   [HONKING]
[02:47:35.220 --> 02:47:36.460]   We all remember two strokes.
[02:47:36.460 --> 02:47:38.900]   What we really need is four stroke leaf blowers.
[02:47:38.900 --> 02:47:39.940]   They make them smoother.
[02:47:39.940 --> 02:47:40.660]   They'd be quieter.
[02:47:40.660 --> 02:47:41.660]   They'd be more powerful.
[02:47:41.660 --> 02:47:43.100]   And if you go to the honeycomb--
[02:47:43.100 --> 02:47:43.620]   Hummer leaf.
[02:47:43.620 --> 02:47:44.380]   --hyberium, samerino.
[02:47:44.380 --> 02:47:45.020]   Hummer leaf blowers.
[02:47:45.020 --> 02:47:48.620]   They have great big, lunar backpack-sized leaf blowers
[02:47:48.620 --> 02:47:50.980]   that go--
[02:47:50.980 --> 02:47:52.060]   but they're still gas powered.
[02:47:52.060 --> 02:47:52.900]   I think electric--
[02:47:52.900 --> 02:47:55.180]   So my question is just to play the other side
[02:47:55.180 --> 02:47:57.420]   of the political fence for a minute, which I don't ever
[02:47:57.420 --> 02:47:59.300]   live uncomfortably.
[02:47:59.300 --> 02:48:02.100]   There's still this discussion about the calculus of, OK,
[02:48:02.100 --> 02:48:03.940]   here's what takes to build an electric car.
[02:48:03.940 --> 02:48:05.460]   Here's what takes to manufacture batteries.
[02:48:05.460 --> 02:48:07.060]   Here's what takes to cycle all that stuff out
[02:48:07.060 --> 02:48:10.380]   of the ecosystem later.
[02:48:10.380 --> 02:48:12.940]   How long do you have to convert to all electric
[02:48:12.940 --> 02:48:16.460]   before that plays out into a net win?
[02:48:16.460 --> 02:48:18.060]   Or do you?
[02:48:18.060 --> 02:48:19.860]   I mean, I've read a bunch of different accounts of this,
[02:48:19.860 --> 02:48:21.900]   and I haven't yet seen one that really convinced me
[02:48:21.900 --> 02:48:25.700]   one way or the other because it's really resource intensive.
[02:48:25.700 --> 02:48:26.300]   And--
[02:48:26.300 --> 02:48:27.700]   Well, it's tough on the grid.
[02:48:27.700 --> 02:48:30.580]   It's also desperately different depending
[02:48:30.580 --> 02:48:31.820]   on where you live.
[02:48:31.820 --> 02:48:32.580]   What is it?
[02:48:32.580 --> 02:48:33.980]   How's EV in UK?
[02:48:33.980 --> 02:48:35.620]   Are people doing EVs?
[02:48:35.620 --> 02:48:38.180]   So EV in UK is interesting.
[02:48:38.180 --> 02:48:39.420]   Again, depending on where you live,
[02:48:39.420 --> 02:48:42.740]   because in California or in America generally,
[02:48:42.740 --> 02:48:46.100]   people have houses that have driveways.
[02:48:46.100 --> 02:48:46.620]   Yes.
[02:48:46.620 --> 02:48:49.660]   And that means you can charge a car on your driveway.
[02:48:49.660 --> 02:48:50.980]   Yeah.
[02:48:50.980 --> 02:48:53.460]   You live in London.
[02:48:53.460 --> 02:48:55.780]   90% of places that you live in London
[02:48:55.780 --> 02:48:56.820]   don't have driveways.
[02:48:56.820 --> 02:48:58.020]   You park on the streets, so you're
[02:48:58.020 --> 02:49:00.420]   relying on the government to provide charging infrastructure
[02:49:00.420 --> 02:49:03.940]   on the street where you live, which is very difficult.
[02:49:03.940 --> 02:49:05.220]   On the other hand, you're probably
[02:49:05.220 --> 02:49:07.220]   driving much shorter distances, which
[02:49:07.220 --> 02:49:09.380]   is either better or worse, depending on your point of view.
[02:49:09.380 --> 02:49:17.140]   I will say that I think I was in Brighton, which is twinned
[02:49:17.140 --> 02:49:19.500]   with Santa Monica in the States.
[02:49:19.500 --> 02:49:22.420]   So that gives you an idea of what kind of place it is.
[02:49:22.420 --> 02:49:26.260]   And this weekend, they had a--
[02:49:26.260 --> 02:49:29.340]   do you guys know Vespas, the little Italian scooters
[02:49:29.340 --> 02:49:30.620]   that were kind of like the--
[02:49:30.620 --> 02:49:31.140]   Always wanted one.
[02:49:31.140 --> 02:49:32.260]   --the whole torture of the '60s?
[02:49:32.260 --> 02:49:34.660]   Always wanted one of those, yeah.
[02:49:34.660 --> 02:49:36.820]   So they had a little mod festival.
[02:49:36.820 --> 02:49:39.300]   And there were hundreds of these bikes,
[02:49:39.300 --> 02:49:42.220]   all along the coastline of Brighton Beach.
[02:49:42.220 --> 02:49:43.020]   Mods.
[02:49:43.020 --> 02:49:43.660]   Mods.
[02:49:43.660 --> 02:49:44.500]   And I was there.
[02:49:44.500 --> 02:49:45.540]   Yeah.
[02:49:45.540 --> 02:49:46.660]   The Mods and Rockers.
[02:49:46.660 --> 02:49:50.140]   And I was there, and I was thinking, what is--
[02:49:50.140 --> 02:49:51.540]   the Mods were the '70s.
[02:49:51.540 --> 02:49:53.180]   We were in the '20s.
[02:49:53.180 --> 02:49:59.260]   In the '20 '70s, what is going to be the equivalent
[02:49:59.260 --> 02:50:01.540]   of the Mods on their Vespas now?
[02:50:01.540 --> 02:50:07.460]   Is it going to be anybody driving a gas powered car?
[02:50:07.460 --> 02:50:09.020]   Is it going to be--
[02:50:09.020 --> 02:50:10.020]   What is the most--
[02:50:10.020 --> 02:50:14.180]   What are we going to have nostalgia for in 50 years,
[02:50:14.180 --> 02:50:16.260]   where we think actually-- that's probably not
[02:50:16.260 --> 02:50:17.980]   very good from the environment, but it's quite cute
[02:50:17.980 --> 02:50:18.540]   at the moment.
[02:50:18.540 --> 02:50:21.180]   Remember when you could go outside without having your hair
[02:50:21.180 --> 02:50:22.260]   burn off?
[02:50:22.260 --> 02:50:24.180]   And I would say--
[02:50:24.180 --> 02:50:30.340]   so my point of view is I love cars,
[02:50:30.340 --> 02:50:34.780]   and I love, unlike Americans, the British have some history.
[02:50:34.780 --> 02:50:38.940]   So we have nice cars in our backfill.
[02:50:38.940 --> 02:50:42.380]   So, yeah, sorry.
[02:50:42.380 --> 02:50:46.660]   So I have a lovely little 1970s sports car.
[02:50:46.660 --> 02:50:47.260]   I'm jealous.
[02:50:47.260 --> 02:50:47.780]   But--
[02:50:47.780 --> 02:50:49.380]   Do you have an MG or Triumph?
[02:50:49.380 --> 02:50:50.020]   What do you have?
[02:50:50.020 --> 02:50:50.740]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:50:50.740 --> 02:50:53.180]   So the 1970 MG drop-off.
[02:50:53.180 --> 02:50:55.220]   So that was the very end of the--
[02:50:55.220 --> 02:50:56.260]   --for those.
[02:50:56.260 --> 02:50:57.180]   Yeah.
[02:50:57.180 --> 02:50:58.020]   As the flip side to that--
[02:50:58.020 --> 02:50:58.620]   How awesome is that?
[02:50:58.620 --> 02:51:00.300]   Because I'm telling you.
[02:51:00.300 --> 02:51:01.620]   Very Austin Powers.
[02:51:01.620 --> 02:51:03.660]   But because I'm turning 40 next week,
[02:51:03.660 --> 02:51:04.500]   and I have a--
[02:51:04.500 --> 02:51:05.900]   Happy birthday, and crime you.
[02:51:05.900 --> 02:51:08.060]   --midlife crisis.
[02:51:08.060 --> 02:51:10.900]   I've bought an electric motorbike.
[02:51:10.900 --> 02:51:12.100]   Perfect.
[02:51:12.100 --> 02:51:14.060]   And it's like-- if you're in London--
[02:51:14.060 --> 02:51:15.020]   That's a perfect choice.
[02:51:15.020 --> 02:51:17.260]   And all you want to do is 40--
[02:51:17.260 --> 02:51:18.340]   range anxiety.
[02:51:18.340 --> 02:51:21.180]   The range on this thing is 40 miles.
[02:51:21.180 --> 02:51:26.460]   But in London, that's about four weeks of riding.
[02:51:26.460 --> 02:51:27.860]   So I've bought a--
[02:51:27.860 --> 02:51:31.860]   there's a great brand called Maving, M-A-E,
[02:51:31.860 --> 02:51:34.220]   v-i-n-g.com.
[02:51:34.220 --> 02:51:39.140]   And they make very classically British-inspired--
[02:51:39.140 --> 02:51:42.140]   sort of triumph-- is all triumph engineers--
[02:51:42.140 --> 02:51:42.780]   That doesn't work.
[02:51:42.780 --> 02:51:44.940]   --that electric bikes.
[02:51:44.940 --> 02:51:46.540]   First of the flames is that--
[02:51:46.540 --> 02:51:47.220]   Excuse me.
[02:51:47.220 --> 02:51:47.740]   I had a lot.
[02:51:47.740 --> 02:51:48.260]   Oh, look.
[02:51:48.260 --> 02:51:48.780]   Really?
[02:51:48.780 --> 02:51:49.540]   I had a lot.
[02:51:49.540 --> 02:51:51.300]   I know that this is not a bicycle.
[02:51:51.300 --> 02:51:52.660]   This is a motorcycle.
[02:51:52.660 --> 02:51:53.140]   Electric.
[02:51:53.140 --> 02:51:54.620]   No, no, no, it's a motorbike.
[02:51:54.620 --> 02:51:55.780]   Yeah.
[02:51:55.780 --> 02:51:56.300]   But from there.
[02:51:56.300 --> 02:51:58.740]   And so that has a little commutaville around London.
[02:51:58.740 --> 02:52:03.060]   And obviously, it's not going to be amazing in LA or Petaluma.
[02:52:03.060 --> 02:52:05.580]   But you screw around New York or any sort of urban area
[02:52:05.580 --> 02:52:06.100]   in that.
[02:52:06.100 --> 02:52:07.700]   And it's going to be fantastic.
[02:52:07.700 --> 02:52:09.980]   What's the top speed on this?
[02:52:09.980 --> 02:52:11.060]   It does about 60.
[02:52:11.060 --> 02:52:12.060]   That's beautiful.
[02:52:12.060 --> 02:52:14.260]   And how much is it?
[02:52:14.260 --> 02:52:19.180]   Uh, about five UK pounds.
[02:52:19.180 --> 02:52:20.060]   Five quid?
[02:52:20.060 --> 02:52:23.300]   About six and a half.
[02:52:23.300 --> 02:52:24.860]   Thousand.
[02:52:24.860 --> 02:52:25.260]   Yeah.
[02:52:25.260 --> 02:52:25.780]   Yeah.
[02:52:25.780 --> 02:52:26.280]   OK.
[02:52:26.280 --> 02:52:27.340]   You'll have the American rosary.
[02:52:27.340 --> 02:52:29.140]   I was getting excited.
[02:52:29.140 --> 02:52:31.060]   Well, it's only five pounds, haven't it?
[02:52:31.060 --> 02:52:32.220]   It's a bad though.
[02:52:32.220 --> 02:52:33.220]   And where's it made?
[02:52:33.220 --> 02:52:35.020]   It's right now with the dollar so strong.
[02:52:35.020 --> 02:52:35.540]   Yeah.
[02:52:35.540 --> 02:52:35.980]   Where's it made?
[02:52:35.980 --> 02:52:36.780]   Well, exactly.
[02:52:36.780 --> 02:52:40.380]   So it's kind of like, well, what is going to be the equivalent of,
[02:52:40.380 --> 02:52:42.500]   you know, we're looking at all the electric things.
[02:52:42.500 --> 02:52:43.940]   And it's great.
[02:52:43.940 --> 02:52:47.420]   But what is going to be the equivalent in 20 or 30 years time
[02:52:47.420 --> 02:52:49.500]   of driving around a vintage car?
[02:52:49.500 --> 02:52:50.820]   Is it going to be--
[02:52:50.820 --> 02:52:51.940]   are we going to have a new--
[02:52:51.940 --> 02:52:53.020]   This is the cutest thing.
[02:52:53.020 --> 02:52:54.020]   --of the cameras.
[02:52:54.020 --> 02:52:57.060]   You look like Lawrence of Arabia riding this around.
[02:52:57.060 --> 02:52:58.900]   That's fantastic.
[02:52:58.900 --> 02:53:00.860]   Steve McQueen, I'm going for a little bit of a quick.
[02:53:00.860 --> 02:53:01.380]   Oh, OK.
[02:53:01.380 --> 02:53:02.740]   Yeah, probably better.
[02:53:02.740 --> 02:53:04.980]   This is so cute.
[02:53:04.980 --> 02:53:06.940]   I'm actually-- I wonder if I can get this in the US.
[02:53:06.940 --> 02:53:07.980]   I'm tempted.
[02:53:07.980 --> 02:53:10.260]   But you've ordered it, or are you just looking at it?
[02:53:10.260 --> 02:53:10.900]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:53:10.900 --> 02:53:12.780]   It's coming a week off to my birthday.
[02:53:12.780 --> 02:53:13.740]   Oh, happy birthday.
[02:53:13.740 --> 02:53:15.980]   What a perfect thing.
[02:53:15.980 --> 02:53:16.500]   OK.
[02:53:16.500 --> 02:53:18.180]   Just in time for my midlife crisis.
[02:53:18.180 --> 02:53:18.580]   Yeah.
[02:53:18.580 --> 02:53:19.260]   There you go.
[02:53:19.260 --> 02:53:23.260]   That and your triumph, you're set.
[02:53:23.260 --> 02:53:24.340]   Maving.
[02:53:24.340 --> 02:53:25.180]   It's great.
[02:53:25.180 --> 02:53:26.340]   Right around.
[02:53:26.340 --> 02:53:27.500]   You're just like a mad rocker.
[02:53:27.500 --> 02:53:27.980]   Maver.
[02:53:27.980 --> 02:53:28.980]   Right.
[02:53:28.980 --> 02:53:31.780]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:53:31.780 --> 02:53:33.100]   Is that a stirrup?
[02:53:33.100 --> 02:53:34.380]   Do you put your foot in the thing?
[02:53:34.380 --> 02:53:35.460]   Yeah, sure.
[02:53:35.460 --> 02:53:36.660]   It's like a horse.
[02:53:36.660 --> 02:53:40.140]   Jack Dorsey says, my biggest regret
[02:53:40.140 --> 02:53:42.500]   is that I turned Twitter into a company.
[02:53:42.500 --> 02:53:44.060]   [SNORING]
[02:53:44.060 --> 02:53:44.500]   Huh?
[02:53:44.500 --> 02:53:45.500]   So--
[02:53:45.500 --> 02:53:46.940]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:53:46.940 --> 02:53:50.300]   So does he mean it could have been Craigslist,
[02:53:50.300 --> 02:53:51.460]   and he could have been like Craig?
[02:53:51.460 --> 02:53:52.300]   Yeah.
[02:53:52.300 --> 02:53:54.180]   Somebody asked him on Twitter, Jack,
[02:53:54.180 --> 02:53:56.420]   wondering what was your intent on Twitter,
[02:53:56.420 --> 02:53:58.500]   and has it turned out the way you
[02:53:58.500 --> 02:53:59.000]   wanted it?
[02:53:59.000 --> 02:54:01.460]   See, it feels a bit skewed leftward right now.
[02:54:01.460 --> 02:54:02.940]   How do we straighten it?
[02:54:02.940 --> 02:54:05.340]   It seems in an ordinary amount of rightward-leaning Twitter
[02:54:05.340 --> 02:54:06.980]   users are being banned or kicked off.
[02:54:06.980 --> 02:54:09.340]   Well, this guy obviously has an agenda.
[02:54:09.340 --> 02:54:10.460]   It can't be good for MDOW.
[02:54:10.460 --> 02:54:12.020]   The biggest issue and my biggest regret
[02:54:12.020 --> 02:54:13.740]   is that it became a company.
[02:54:13.740 --> 02:54:17.100]   I think what he meant-- and it's interesting to read the replies--
[02:54:17.100 --> 02:54:20.380]   is I wish it had been a protocol.
[02:54:20.380 --> 02:54:26.740]   And Kevin Marx says, well, I might point out
[02:54:26.740 --> 02:54:29.580]   we were treating it as a protocol,
[02:54:29.580 --> 02:54:32.780]   because you had an API right up until Chirp when Twitter
[02:54:32.780 --> 02:54:35.980]   rug pulled that killed all third party clients in most apps.
[02:54:35.980 --> 02:54:37.180]   Oh, I remember that.
[02:54:37.180 --> 02:54:40.060]   The Twitter-- the Twitter winter.
[02:54:40.060 --> 02:54:40.380]   So--
[02:54:40.380 --> 02:54:43.220]   I mean, it's really good for Jack to talk about,
[02:54:43.220 --> 02:54:45.060]   oh, I really wish I'd made it open.
[02:54:45.060 --> 02:54:46.940]   I really wish I'd done this not in the other.
[02:54:46.940 --> 02:54:50.660]   It's like, dude, A, you made an absolute shoot term of money.
[02:54:50.660 --> 02:54:52.860]   So it's very easy to look back and say,
[02:54:52.860 --> 02:54:54.500]   I wish I'd done it a different way
[02:54:54.500 --> 02:54:58.100]   from a perspective of immense privilege and immense money.
[02:54:58.100 --> 02:55:02.460]   And every point you had the opportunity to make Twitter open,
[02:55:02.460 --> 02:55:05.860]   you repeatedly chose to not do that.
[02:55:05.860 --> 02:55:07.540]   So he has regrets.
[02:55:07.540 --> 02:55:09.020]   You bought TweetDeck.
[02:55:09.020 --> 02:55:12.740]   You bought every single thing that was successful.
[02:55:12.740 --> 02:55:14.180]   You killed it all off.
[02:55:14.180 --> 02:55:19.260]   So I mean, sure have regrets, but it's very hard
[02:55:19.260 --> 02:55:22.020]   to have regrets over things that you consciously
[02:55:22.020 --> 02:55:23.820]   repeatedly chose to do.
[02:55:23.820 --> 02:55:26.220]   It's like, maybe I have regret over this one thing
[02:55:26.220 --> 02:55:27.820]   that I did once occasionally.
[02:55:27.820 --> 02:55:30.940]   But if you keep doing something, can you really regret it?
[02:55:30.940 --> 02:55:31.780]   It's more like more.
[02:55:31.780 --> 02:55:33.180]   At that point, you've made a live choice.
[02:55:33.180 --> 02:55:34.580]   You could say I was a jerk.
[02:55:34.580 --> 02:55:36.540]   Uh, well.
[02:55:36.540 --> 02:55:40.260]   Like the five times that I shut down every client
[02:55:40.260 --> 02:55:43.460]   and every API, and I rate limited everything
[02:55:43.460 --> 02:55:46.060]   that I accessed Twitter, and I refused to build
[02:55:46.060 --> 02:55:49.500]   a decent desktop client, and I refused to build a mobile app
[02:55:49.500 --> 02:55:50.700]   that I mean--
[02:55:50.700 --> 02:55:51.100]   How much--
[02:55:51.100 --> 02:55:51.100]   How much--
[02:55:51.100 --> 02:55:51.100]   --how much--
[02:55:51.100 --> 02:55:51.100]   --how much--
[02:55:51.100 --> 02:55:51.600]   --of your--
[02:55:51.600 --> 02:55:52.340]   --do you really have?
[02:55:52.340 --> 02:55:53.740]   Maybe he's learned his lesson.
[02:55:53.740 --> 02:55:57.460]   Well, a few billion dollars will give everyone perspective, right?
[02:55:57.460 --> 02:56:02.300]   Here is a final story that I think has a happy ending.
[02:56:02.300 --> 02:56:05.380]   A Unix legend, Brian Kernahan, who
[02:56:05.380 --> 02:56:07.700]   was instrumental in writing Linux--
[02:56:07.700 --> 02:56:09.940]   sorry, Unix.
[02:56:09.940 --> 02:56:13.420]   I have his book, the C programming language, brilliant guy,
[02:56:13.420 --> 02:56:15.380]   Princeton professor.
[02:56:15.380 --> 02:56:18.100]   He's now 80 years old.
[02:56:18.100 --> 02:56:20.580]   He realized that the AUK program that he
[02:56:20.580 --> 02:56:25.540]   wrote that is widely used on Unix-like platforms
[02:56:25.540 --> 02:56:28.460]   didn't support Unicode, so he wrote it.
[02:56:28.460 --> 02:56:29.780]   He added--
[02:56:29.780 --> 02:56:32.460]   and because he says, I don't really understand Git,
[02:56:32.460 --> 02:56:34.220]   I'm just going to email you.
[02:56:34.220 --> 02:56:36.540]   I'm going to email you the code.
[02:56:36.540 --> 02:56:40.340]   Unicode support for AUK at the age of 80.
[02:56:40.340 --> 02:56:41.620]   I've tested this a fair amount.
[02:56:41.620 --> 02:56:42.940]   It clearly means more tests.
[02:56:42.940 --> 02:56:48.900]   He wrote an email to the one true AUK repo posted
[02:56:48.900 --> 02:56:50.900]   by longtime maintainer Arnold Robbins.
[02:56:50.900 --> 02:56:54.060]   Once I figure out how I will try to submit a pull request,
[02:56:54.060 --> 02:56:56.580]   I wish I understood Git better.
[02:56:56.580 --> 02:56:57.940]   But in spite of your help, I still
[02:56:57.940 --> 02:56:59.700]   don't have a proper understanding.
[02:56:59.700 --> 02:57:01.980]   So this may take a while.
[02:57:01.980 --> 02:57:06.540]   It made me pull out my old C programming language book,
[02:57:06.540 --> 02:57:09.780]   which I got in 1982 and realized that that was--
[02:57:09.780 --> 02:57:18.100]   Kernahan was 40 back then, and I was a mere sprout of 25.
[02:57:18.100 --> 02:57:19.820]   No, but it's a beautiful--
[02:57:19.820 --> 02:57:21.020]   What a legend.
[02:57:21.020 --> 02:57:21.620]   Kernahan?
[02:57:21.620 --> 02:57:22.060]   Yes.
[02:57:22.060 --> 02:57:23.540]   Just absolute legend.
[02:57:23.540 --> 02:57:26.100]   And a wonderful story, wonderful story.
[02:57:26.100 --> 02:57:29.820]   And a real example of how we can really venerate
[02:57:29.820 --> 02:57:33.020]   all the incredible web three entrepreneurs
[02:57:33.020 --> 02:57:38.300]   and all the incredible people that are doing the new,
[02:57:38.300 --> 02:57:42.380]   but how we're all standing on the shoulders of giants.
[02:57:42.380 --> 02:57:46.380]   And that generation of early computer scientists
[02:57:46.380 --> 02:57:50.380]   and engineers are hitting that golden age.
[02:57:50.380 --> 02:57:53.900]   And we're going to see them in their retirement.
[02:57:53.900 --> 02:57:56.580]   The service core of retired executives
[02:57:56.580 --> 02:57:59.020]   is now the service core of retired engineers
[02:57:59.020 --> 02:57:59.980]   or something of a moment.
[02:57:59.980 --> 02:58:03.300]   His co-author on the C programming language
[02:58:03.300 --> 02:58:05.900]   passed several years ago, Richie.
[02:58:05.900 --> 02:58:08.980]   And that was a big deal when he passed.
[02:58:08.980 --> 02:58:13.060]   Because we've realized-- I've realized it for some time
[02:58:13.060 --> 02:58:19.820]   that we've walked amongst legends, like Becky Worley.
[02:58:19.820 --> 02:58:22.700]   And I will be telling such stories about you.
[02:58:22.700 --> 02:58:23.980]   I'm not a legend yet.
[02:58:23.980 --> 02:58:25.980]   Well, we lost you picking in this space.
[02:58:25.980 --> 02:58:26.980]   There you go.
[02:58:26.980 --> 02:58:28.340]   Hey, I have two quick updates.
[02:58:28.340 --> 02:58:30.020]   I know you're trying to wrap this.
[02:58:30.020 --> 02:58:33.180]   But MIT says, when it comes to clean technologies
[02:58:33.180 --> 02:58:36.180]   like electric cars, even the dirtiest batteries
[02:58:36.180 --> 02:58:39.380]   emit less CO2 than using no battery at all.
[02:58:39.380 --> 02:58:41.580]   So that's the answer to Rod's question.
[02:58:41.580 --> 02:58:47.940]   And during this show, Elon Musk tweeted, Godspeed Artemis.
[02:58:47.940 --> 02:58:52.260]   So as we look forward to the week and the possible launch,
[02:58:52.260 --> 02:58:53.660]   let's just keep our fingers crossed.
[02:58:53.660 --> 02:58:54.940]   We didn't really talk about that.
[02:58:54.940 --> 02:58:59.860]   But that's tomorrow morning at 5.30 Pacific A30 Eastern.
[02:58:59.860 --> 02:59:02.460]   If it goes off, it's--
[02:59:02.460 --> 02:59:03.700]   Turn it on the background.
[02:59:03.700 --> 02:59:06.540]   And if you don't hear a countdown hold at 30 seconds,
[02:59:06.540 --> 02:59:08.700]   you can probably assume it's going to go.
[02:59:08.700 --> 02:59:11.620]   The NASA stream is in 4K on YouTube.
[02:59:11.620 --> 02:59:17.100]   If you have access to a 4K set, that will be worth watching.
[02:59:17.100 --> 02:59:18.020]   It is unmanned.
[02:59:18.020 --> 02:59:23.660]   There's only a mannequin aboard, Moonikin Campos,
[02:59:23.660 --> 02:59:27.020]   who is named after Campos was Capcom, right?
[02:59:27.020 --> 02:59:28.180]   Or he was an astronaut.
[02:59:28.180 --> 02:59:29.180]   Yeah.
[02:59:29.180 --> 02:59:32.060]   This is NASA trying to popularize things better.
[02:59:32.060 --> 02:59:33.340]   And Moonikin because--
[02:59:33.340 --> 02:59:36.340]   But Moonikin just hurts.
[02:59:36.340 --> 02:59:37.820]   Why not?
[02:59:37.820 --> 02:59:39.660]   He'll be sitting in the command seat.
[02:59:39.660 --> 02:59:40.540]   So you'll see him.
[02:59:40.540 --> 02:59:42.260]   With a speaker in his mouth talking
[02:59:42.260 --> 02:59:43.780]   to the Amazon Alexa system.
[02:59:43.780 --> 02:59:44.300]   Yeah.
[02:59:44.300 --> 02:59:47.660]   Apparently they got some money from Jeff Bezos.
[02:59:47.660 --> 02:59:52.580]   And from it turns out, Cisco WebEx, Cisco and Amazon
[02:59:52.580 --> 02:59:56.180]   partnered to do a test of the Amazon Echo in space.
[02:59:56.180 --> 02:59:58.340]   Because astronauts really need to be
[02:59:58.340 --> 03:00:02.940]   able to talk to the spacecraft.
[03:00:02.940 --> 03:00:05.220]   I can remember one time that didn't work so well.
[03:00:05.220 --> 03:00:05.820]   How?
[03:00:05.820 --> 03:00:07.460]   Open the pod bay doors, how?
[03:00:07.460 --> 03:00:10.060]   Well, open the pod bay doors now.
[03:00:10.060 --> 03:00:12.620]   And do they really have to now?
[03:00:12.620 --> 03:00:14.020]   As she said, I know you're trying to wrap up.
[03:00:14.020 --> 03:00:18.620]   But there's so much available on glass panel controls.
[03:00:18.620 --> 03:00:21.460]   It's not the push buttons and toggle switches
[03:00:21.460 --> 03:00:22.940]   in the Apollo and shuttle era.
[03:00:22.940 --> 03:00:24.060]   Do they really need that?
[03:00:24.060 --> 03:00:25.780]   I mean, I guess it could be handy, especially if you're
[03:00:25.780 --> 03:00:26.580]   in a space walk.
[03:00:26.580 --> 03:00:27.980]   They need it because--
[03:00:27.980 --> 03:00:29.340]   They need the money from Amazon.
[03:00:29.340 --> 03:00:32.420]   I need more electric wiring cable.
[03:00:32.420 --> 03:00:34.740]   I'm glad you like Motley Crue.
[03:00:34.740 --> 03:00:37.580]   I'll be happy to play this song for you know.
[03:00:37.580 --> 03:00:38.660]   Tell me, April.
[03:00:38.660 --> 03:00:40.660]   Yeah.
[03:00:40.660 --> 03:00:43.260]   Our tour campus was a NASA electrical power
[03:00:43.260 --> 03:00:46.980]   subsystem manager who was called upon Houston.
[03:00:46.980 --> 03:00:49.860]   We have a problem with Apollo 13 and helped
[03:00:49.860 --> 03:00:52.660]   get Apollo 13 safely back to Earth.
[03:00:52.660 --> 03:00:56.220]   So I think a very appropriate tribute to--
[03:00:56.220 --> 03:00:57.900]   he probably wouldn't be thrilled to know
[03:00:57.900 --> 03:00:59.660]   that the first name, Mooniken.
[03:00:59.660 --> 03:01:01.100]   But--
[03:01:01.100 --> 03:01:02.540]   But there you go.
[03:01:02.540 --> 03:01:05.580]   It is wearing the Orion Crew Survival Suit System.
[03:01:05.580 --> 03:01:07.060]   Yeah.
[03:01:07.060 --> 03:01:07.580]   There you go.
[03:01:07.580 --> 03:01:10.100]   Nice because they don't have an EVA suit yet.
[03:01:10.100 --> 03:01:10.580]   Yeah.
[03:01:10.580 --> 03:01:12.780]   Looks like they're bringing a child mannequin along.
[03:01:12.780 --> 03:01:14.900]   I don't know what that's all about, but OK.
[03:01:14.900 --> 03:01:17.580]   Well, this will be the first woman to go to the moon.
[03:01:17.580 --> 03:01:19.620]   So maybe it's a smaller--
[03:01:19.620 --> 03:01:22.260]   Oh, maybe that's the lady.
[03:01:22.260 --> 03:01:25.460]   Although two of the ladies are rugby players
[03:01:25.460 --> 03:01:27.980]   who could snap you in half.
[03:01:27.980 --> 03:01:29.220]   Yeah, so that's exciting.
[03:01:29.220 --> 03:01:31.700]   I don't feel like they need any compensation.
[03:01:31.700 --> 03:01:35.140]   This mission might be quite competent for the women.
[03:01:35.140 --> 03:01:38.020]   This is the first of three on our missions.
[03:01:38.020 --> 03:01:42.580]   The first one will go actually 40,000 miles past the moon
[03:01:42.580 --> 03:01:44.020]   and then come back.
[03:01:44.020 --> 03:01:45.860]   So this is a really long--
[03:01:45.860 --> 03:01:49.500]   because it's uncrew, they're going out for about 40 days.
[03:01:49.500 --> 03:01:52.740]   So they're going in this really weird, big halo orbit.
[03:01:52.740 --> 03:01:55.860]   So it's different orbit than any of the Apollo missions used.
[03:01:55.860 --> 03:01:57.900]   And it's to accommodate-- part of what's
[03:01:57.900 --> 03:02:01.620]   wrong with Artemis, if I may, is that the upper stage
[03:02:01.620 --> 03:02:04.860]   is so underpowered that even though the main part of the rocket
[03:02:04.860 --> 03:02:06.620]   is more powerful than the Saturn 5,
[03:02:06.620 --> 03:02:08.260]   it doesn't have the lifting capability
[03:02:08.260 --> 03:02:12.300]   the moon the Saturn 5 have, which is why we have all this--
[03:02:12.300 --> 03:02:14.940]   we got to meet Elon's rocket out in lunar orbit
[03:02:14.940 --> 03:02:16.220]   to get people down the surface.
[03:02:16.220 --> 03:02:20.140]   So it's a very-- right now, the physics of this
[03:02:20.140 --> 03:02:20.940]   are really weird.
[03:02:20.940 --> 03:02:24.860]   Basically, they're going to-- so this is the first uncrewed one.
[03:02:24.860 --> 03:02:26.740]   Next one will be a loop around the moon mission
[03:02:26.740 --> 03:02:28.180]   like Apollo 8.
[03:02:28.180 --> 03:02:30.380]   And then the third one, Artemis 3,
[03:02:30.380 --> 03:02:35.300]   which will happen in 2025, maybe 7, somewhere in there,
[03:02:35.300 --> 03:02:36.860]   will carry the first three people, which
[03:02:36.860 --> 03:02:39.100]   is when we get the first woman and first person
[03:02:39.100 --> 03:02:40.300]   of color to the moon.
[03:02:40.300 --> 03:02:44.540]   But by law, you have to launch them on the SLS,
[03:02:44.540 --> 03:02:46.180]   which is the big government rocket.
[03:02:46.180 --> 03:02:47.860]   God bless them, I hope it works.
[03:02:47.860 --> 03:02:49.700]   In an Orion capsule, which is a third bigger
[03:02:49.700 --> 03:02:51.660]   than the Apollo capsule, three people,
[03:02:51.660 --> 03:02:54.460]   you got to go to lunar parking orbit
[03:02:54.460 --> 03:02:57.780]   where you meet up with Elon Musk's lunar starship.
[03:02:57.780 --> 03:03:00.900]   And then two of those three get in the nose of the starship,
[03:03:00.900 --> 03:03:03.700]   taking up about 3% of its total volume
[03:03:03.700 --> 03:03:07.020]   with this enormous chasm of an RV behind them
[03:03:07.020 --> 03:03:09.220]   and land it tail first on the moon.
[03:03:09.220 --> 03:03:10.580]   So it's a little weird.
[03:03:10.580 --> 03:03:11.140]   It's--
[03:03:11.140 --> 03:03:12.420]   But this is the first step.
[03:03:12.420 --> 03:03:14.700]   A dog's breakfast of a launch.
[03:03:14.700 --> 03:03:18.220]   [LAUGHTER]
[03:03:18.220 --> 03:03:18.940]   A month long.
[03:03:18.940 --> 03:03:21.460]   We know what dogs eat, so yeah, that's--
[03:03:21.460 --> 03:03:24.260]   Snoopy will be going along for the ride.
[03:03:24.260 --> 03:03:28.780]   Three mannequins, toys, and an Amazon Echo.
[03:03:28.780 --> 03:03:29.780]   An iPad.
[03:03:29.780 --> 03:03:30.980]   An iPad.
[03:03:30.980 --> 03:03:33.500]   I thought the iPad was the one talking to the Echo.
[03:03:33.500 --> 03:03:35.380]   What's the iPad up there for?
[03:03:35.380 --> 03:03:36.140]   I'm not sure.
[03:03:36.140 --> 03:03:36.660]   I thought--
[03:03:36.660 --> 03:03:38.420]   Wait, are we going to Siri talking to a latter?
[03:03:38.420 --> 03:03:40.820]   I think that would be very interesting.
[03:03:40.820 --> 03:03:41.820]   Yeah.
[03:03:41.820 --> 03:03:42.300]   Yeah.
[03:03:42.300 --> 03:03:44.820]   But maybe they ended up mounting the iPad there.
[03:03:44.820 --> 03:03:45.980]   But I mean, God bless them.
[03:03:45.980 --> 03:03:48.260]   They've been working on this rocket since 2002
[03:03:48.260 --> 03:03:50.100]   in one form or another.
[03:03:50.100 --> 03:03:52.820]   And it's supposed to be easy because it's recycled
[03:03:52.820 --> 03:03:54.060]   in the shuttle parts.
[03:03:54.060 --> 03:03:55.820]   So we know they're going to fly at least four times
[03:03:55.820 --> 03:03:57.220]   because they have that many shuttle engines.
[03:03:57.220 --> 03:03:59.060]   They've got 16 of them sitting around a warehouse.
[03:03:59.060 --> 03:04:00.780]   They have to use them up?
[03:04:00.780 --> 03:04:01.580]   Well, yeah.
[03:04:01.580 --> 03:04:02.060]   That's congress.
[03:04:02.060 --> 03:04:06.180]   That's how we're saving money at $4 billion with a B. Yeah.
[03:04:06.180 --> 03:04:08.740]   And then we'll see what happens after that.
[03:04:08.740 --> 03:04:11.180]   But it's good to have a moon rocket.
[03:04:11.180 --> 03:04:14.140]   Elon could wake up one morning and say, this space stuff
[03:04:14.140 --> 03:04:14.820]   is for the birds.
[03:04:14.820 --> 03:04:15.900]   I don't want to do it anymore.
[03:04:15.900 --> 03:04:17.940]   So it's good to have a government program.
[03:04:17.940 --> 03:04:19.500]   So more power to them.
[03:04:19.500 --> 03:04:20.900]   It is an Elon touch.
[03:04:20.900 --> 03:04:24.820]   So they've in the past on Elon launches had a zero gravity
[03:04:24.820 --> 03:04:27.220]   indicator, just like a puppet or something floating around.
[03:04:27.220 --> 03:04:28.620]   This time it would be snoopy.
[03:04:28.620 --> 03:04:29.180]   Yeah.
[03:04:29.180 --> 03:04:32.860]   This would be a snoopy in a space suit floating around.
[03:04:32.860 --> 03:04:35.580]   That'll be the quote zero gravity indicator.
[03:04:35.580 --> 03:04:38.260]   Maybe next time Elon will carry something from the new house
[03:04:38.260 --> 03:04:40.460]   of dragons, is that what you said this new show is?
[03:04:40.460 --> 03:04:47.220]   Oh, and just as a sob to will, Sean the sheep will be aboard.
[03:04:47.220 --> 03:04:47.700]   Aww.
[03:04:47.700 --> 03:04:48.700]   Aww.
[03:04:48.700 --> 03:04:49.700]   Oh, that's the cot you're--
[03:04:49.700 --> 03:04:50.700]   That's the cot you're--
[03:04:50.700 --> 03:04:53.780]   That's the contribution of the European Space Agency, ESA.
[03:04:53.780 --> 03:04:55.100]   And I'm not joking.
[03:04:55.100 --> 03:04:57.260]   He's wearing an ESA.
[03:04:57.260 --> 03:04:59.620]   He's from Wallace and Gromit.
[03:04:59.620 --> 03:05:00.140]   OK.
[03:05:00.140 --> 03:05:00.620]   There you go.
[03:05:00.620 --> 03:05:01.300]   All right.
[03:05:01.300 --> 03:05:02.060]   Should be a lot of fun.
[03:05:02.060 --> 03:05:03.060]   There's also--
[03:05:03.060 --> 03:05:04.060]   Space, when did it's worse.
[03:05:04.060 --> 03:05:06.620]   A bunch of Apollo 11 crap.
[03:05:06.620 --> 03:05:08.660]   Hey.
[03:05:08.660 --> 03:05:10.340]   They're sticking in there.
[03:05:10.340 --> 03:05:12.060]   They're getting it all in, baby.
[03:05:12.060 --> 03:05:15.860]   Look, here's a bolt from the Apollo 11 F1 engine
[03:05:15.860 --> 03:05:18.500]   that will be flying on Artemis.
[03:05:18.500 --> 03:05:20.580]   Wouldn't it be ironic if it brought
[03:05:20.580 --> 03:05:22.140]   the Artemis 1 broke?
[03:05:22.140 --> 03:05:24.340]   Moonikin came to life and repaired it
[03:05:24.340 --> 03:05:26.860]   with the bolt from Apollo's F1 engine.
[03:05:26.860 --> 03:05:28.340]   Following instructions from--
[03:05:28.340 --> 03:05:29.700]   From Amazon's Echo.
[03:05:29.700 --> 03:05:30.540]   Echo's, right.
[03:05:30.540 --> 03:05:31.060]   Yeah.
[03:05:31.060 --> 03:05:31.780]   That's a door.
[03:05:31.780 --> 03:05:34.540]   Yeah, it's OK.
[03:05:34.540 --> 03:05:35.060]   All right.
[03:05:35.060 --> 03:05:36.340]   The bolt to the right, you idiot.
[03:05:36.340 --> 03:05:37.220]   I'm glad-- I forgot.
[03:05:37.220 --> 03:05:38.260]   We completely forgot.
[03:05:38.260 --> 03:05:39.580]   This is the whole reason you're here, Rodpile.
[03:05:39.580 --> 03:05:40.580]   So thank you.
[03:05:40.580 --> 03:05:41.420]   That's why I'm lying.
[03:05:41.420 --> 03:05:42.580]   Can I add one quick thing?
[03:05:42.580 --> 03:05:43.380]   Yeah.
[03:05:43.380 --> 03:05:48.540]   September 26th, the Dart mission reaches Diddymos.
[03:05:48.540 --> 03:05:51.460]   And the Dart mission is a double asteroid redirect test.
[03:05:51.460 --> 03:05:54.540]   This is NASA's little heralded test
[03:05:54.540 --> 03:05:57.060]   to slam a spacecraft into an asteroid
[03:05:57.060 --> 03:05:59.900]   to see if we actually can knock them off course.
[03:05:59.900 --> 03:06:02.700]   Should they be on their way to take out a major city?
[03:06:02.700 --> 03:06:04.140]   Kind of a poor--
[03:06:04.140 --> 03:06:08.020]   So it's a very small rock, but it's a valid test.
[03:06:08.020 --> 03:06:10.580]   And if the physics of it work out as they plan,
[03:06:10.580 --> 03:06:12.020]   then we start building bigger ones,
[03:06:12.020 --> 03:06:13.540]   and we'll protect ourselves, we hope,
[03:06:13.540 --> 03:06:15.340]   in the event that should ever occur.
[03:06:15.340 --> 03:06:18.900]   And the Chinese, to the form, have decided they're
[03:06:18.900 --> 03:06:22.300]   going to run their own mission with the same general design
[03:06:22.300 --> 03:06:24.860]   in about two years using technology that
[03:06:24.860 --> 03:06:26.180]   looks hauntingly like ours.
[03:06:26.180 --> 03:06:28.620]   And this is the stuff you learn on this week in space.
[03:06:28.620 --> 03:06:29.860]   On this week in space.
[03:06:29.860 --> 03:06:31.220]   On Twitch, on the Twitch network.
[03:06:31.220 --> 03:06:32.500]   Rod in the dark mouth.
[03:06:32.500 --> 03:06:34.620]   Thank you so much for being here.
[03:06:34.620 --> 03:06:35.220]   Thanks.
[03:06:35.220 --> 03:06:38.380]   Rodpile, space.nss.org, if you want to subscribe
[03:06:38.380 --> 03:06:40.820]   to add Astra, look for his books in the bookstore.
[03:06:40.820 --> 03:06:43.820]   Becky Worley, what are you working on for ABC?
[03:06:43.820 --> 03:06:47.900]   Anything exciting besides the sleep study thing?
[03:06:47.900 --> 03:06:50.980]   I have a lot of tech stuff going on, Apple stuff,
[03:06:50.980 --> 03:06:53.420]   and then waterproof mascara.
[03:06:53.420 --> 03:06:54.460]   Awesome.
[03:06:54.460 --> 03:06:55.980]   I've been looking for that for years.
[03:06:55.980 --> 03:06:56.900]   Me too.
[03:06:56.900 --> 03:06:57.460]   I know.
[03:06:57.460 --> 03:06:59.980]   Because I cry a lot on camera.
[03:06:59.980 --> 03:07:02.460]   Tammy Fay would have loved this.
[03:07:02.460 --> 03:07:06.180]   I did magnetic eyelashes a couple months ago.
[03:07:06.180 --> 03:07:06.900]   How do you like those?
[03:07:06.900 --> 03:07:07.900]   This is outcropping.
[03:07:07.900 --> 03:07:10.860]   They're incredible technology and a great innovation.
[03:07:10.860 --> 03:07:12.380]   Do they snap onto your eyelashes?
[03:07:12.380 --> 03:07:13.220]   Yeah.
[03:07:13.220 --> 03:07:17.900]   You use a metallic eyeliner and then you snap the lashes onto it.
[03:07:17.900 --> 03:07:21.540]   And we did an open top bust going across the Golden Gate Bridge
[03:07:21.540 --> 03:07:23.460]   to test if they made it or not.
[03:07:23.460 --> 03:07:25.460]   And two of the eight lashes went.
[03:07:25.460 --> 03:07:29.860]   But the last just holding on is pretty damn good.
[03:07:29.860 --> 03:07:32.060]   You have a cooler life than me.
[03:07:32.060 --> 03:07:35.140]   Now, unfortunately, Becky has been labeled the eyelash
[03:07:35.140 --> 03:07:35.740]   reporter.
[03:07:35.740 --> 03:07:39.860]   And anytime there is an eyelash product, Worley gets it.
[03:07:39.860 --> 03:07:40.820]   I love you, Becky.
[03:07:40.820 --> 03:07:42.180]   It's so great to see you.
[03:07:42.180 --> 03:07:43.020]   I love spending time with you.
[03:07:43.020 --> 03:07:44.980]   Congratulations on the kids.
[03:07:44.980 --> 03:07:48.500]   On everything it's going great for you on ABC.
[03:07:48.500 --> 03:07:48.980]   Always a pleasure.
[03:07:48.980 --> 03:07:50.260]   I love Talisa.
[03:07:50.260 --> 03:07:51.420]   Thank you.
[03:07:51.420 --> 03:07:52.220]   And the crew.
[03:07:52.220 --> 03:07:53.940]   Come see us sometime soon.
[03:07:53.940 --> 03:07:54.340]   I would.
[03:07:54.340 --> 03:07:54.940]   I'd love to.
[03:07:54.940 --> 03:07:55.540]   Good.
[03:07:55.540 --> 03:07:58.260]   Will Harris, I'm going to see you because you're
[03:07:58.260 --> 03:08:00.900]   in Jolly Old England.
[03:08:00.900 --> 03:08:04.580]   And I love London, where it is the middle of the night.
[03:08:04.580 --> 03:08:07.500]   Go wander on down to the Greenwich Observatory
[03:08:07.500 --> 03:08:09.060]   and just check and see for us.
[03:08:09.060 --> 03:08:09.900]   Will you?
[03:08:09.900 --> 03:08:11.820]   I'll just check what time it is right now.
[03:08:11.820 --> 03:08:12.860]   Which just let us know.
[03:08:12.860 --> 03:08:14.860]   I'll jump out of the apartment and just run it down and check.
[03:08:14.860 --> 03:08:20.740]   He's apparently 100 yards away from the Greenwich Meridian.
[03:08:20.740 --> 03:08:21.340]   Wow.
[03:08:21.340 --> 03:08:22.100]   Yeah.
[03:08:22.100 --> 03:08:23.420]   We're very close.
[03:08:23.420 --> 03:08:24.060]   We're very close.
[03:08:24.060 --> 03:08:27.460]   So I can tell you that it is-- although you say that,
[03:08:27.460 --> 03:08:29.740]   I never really believe in the concept of anything
[03:08:29.740 --> 03:08:31.780]   other than Apple time.
[03:08:31.780 --> 03:08:34.500]   Time is just what the Apple servers tell me it is
[03:08:34.500 --> 03:08:36.700]   on whatever device I happen to be looking at.
[03:08:36.700 --> 03:08:37.060]   Fair enough.
[03:08:37.060 --> 03:08:39.340]   So I mean, the Greenwich Meridian could be hours out.
[03:08:39.340 --> 03:08:42.380]   But if Apple tells me it's 140, it's 140.
[03:08:42.380 --> 03:08:44.220]   Oh, but at least at 100 meters away,
[03:08:44.220 --> 03:08:46.460]   your MG might make it.
[03:08:46.460 --> 03:08:48.660]   So there's something to be said for.
[03:08:48.660 --> 03:08:50.500]   You only need one tune up on the way.
[03:08:50.500 --> 03:08:51.940]   Little British manufacturing energy.
[03:08:51.940 --> 03:08:53.020]   It's not that.
[03:08:53.020 --> 03:08:56.220]   It's the big oil on cars that came from the rainiest country
[03:08:56.220 --> 03:08:58.500]   on Earth that don't run in the rain.
[03:08:58.500 --> 03:08:59.020]   Yeah.
[03:08:59.020 --> 03:09:00.660]   No, you don't want to take that car around.
[03:09:00.660 --> 03:09:01.500]   I'm jealous.
[03:09:01.500 --> 03:09:02.140]   I'm jealous.
[03:09:02.140 --> 03:09:02.940]   What a great car.
[03:09:02.940 --> 03:09:03.580]   I'm so jealous.
[03:09:03.580 --> 03:09:04.140]   Thank you, Will.
[03:09:04.140 --> 03:09:05.340]   It's great to see you.
[03:09:05.340 --> 03:09:07.300]   Unbound.com.
[03:09:07.300 --> 03:09:09.900]   42, the Douglas Adams book.
[03:09:09.900 --> 03:09:11.820]   All sorts of great stuff you're doing.
[03:09:11.820 --> 03:09:13.340]   Really interesting publishing.
[03:09:13.340 --> 03:09:15.460]   I love really great geeky books.
[03:09:15.460 --> 03:09:16.620]   Loads of stuff you're going to love.
[03:09:16.620 --> 03:09:21.140]   We've got an entire book on the butts of characters
[03:09:21.140 --> 03:09:22.660]   and video games that's all about.
[03:09:22.660 --> 03:09:25.860]   It starts with the concept of Mario's butt.
[03:09:25.860 --> 03:09:27.540]   How did you invent Mario's butt?
[03:09:27.540 --> 03:09:28.420]   It's a great question.
[03:09:28.420 --> 03:09:28.940]   Is that a bot?
[03:09:28.940 --> 03:09:29.860]   So--
[03:09:29.860 --> 03:09:31.460]   No, I think it's easy.
[03:09:31.460 --> 03:09:33.900]   We almost got all the way through
[03:09:33.900 --> 03:09:36.620]   without talking about Mario's bottom.
[03:09:36.620 --> 03:09:39.020]   Not any butts.
[03:09:39.020 --> 03:09:40.580]   Well, I thought I'd save you at the end.
[03:09:40.580 --> 03:09:42.660]   So yeah, if anybody wants to go to unbound.com,
[03:09:42.660 --> 03:09:46.220]   Twitter 15 will get a 15% off a nice old book.
[03:09:46.220 --> 03:09:48.500]   So enjoy Mario's butt.
[03:09:48.500 --> 03:09:49.540]   Oh, God.
[03:09:49.540 --> 03:09:52.900]   Well, from all the other threadbare authors, I know,
[03:09:52.900 --> 03:09:54.420]   thank you very much for what you're doing.
[03:09:54.420 --> 03:09:55.260]   Yes, I agree.
[03:09:55.260 --> 03:09:56.420]   Please burn down Amazon.
[03:09:56.420 --> 03:09:57.260]   I'm publishing for me.
[03:09:57.260 --> 03:09:58.140]   I agree.
[03:09:58.140 --> 03:10:00.260]   Appreciate it.
[03:10:00.260 --> 03:10:01.820]   Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:10:01.820 --> 03:10:02.980]   You guys rock.
[03:10:02.980 --> 03:10:04.940]   You put up with the-- I think the longest
[03:10:04.940 --> 03:10:05.860]   show we've ever done.
[03:10:06.820 --> 03:10:10.140]   Honest to God, Patrick Delahandy will tell me.
[03:10:10.140 --> 03:10:12.420]   But at three hours and 12 minutes,
[03:10:12.420 --> 03:10:14.380]   I think it's the longest show we've ever done.
[03:10:14.380 --> 03:10:16.060]   You deserve a break.
[03:10:16.060 --> 03:10:17.460]   Sorry, you're apologizing to me.
[03:10:17.460 --> 03:10:18.860]   I'm the one who kicked you.
[03:10:18.860 --> 03:10:20.260]   Thank you for being here.
[03:10:20.260 --> 03:10:22.300]   I really appreciate it.
[03:10:22.300 --> 03:10:22.940]   Good night, Will.
[03:10:22.940 --> 03:10:23.900]   Thank you, Leah.
[03:10:23.900 --> 03:10:24.700]   Bye, guys.
[03:10:24.700 --> 03:10:25.340]   What's he doing?
[03:10:25.340 --> 03:10:26.980]   He's miming something.
[03:10:26.980 --> 03:10:29.060]   I'm waiting for the another Twit is.
[03:10:29.060 --> 03:10:33.020]   Another Twit is--
[03:10:33.020 --> 03:10:35.420]   In the Twit.
[03:10:35.420 --> 03:10:36.980]   Bye-bye, everybody.
[03:10:36.980 --> 03:10:38.620]   I won't keep you around much lunch.
[03:10:38.620 --> 03:10:39.140]   See you.
[03:10:39.140 --> 03:10:39.620]   It's amazing.
[03:10:39.620 --> 03:10:42.620]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[03:10:42.620 --> 03:10:43.460]   I'm on a Twit.
[03:10:43.460 --> 03:10:44.220]   Do on the Twit.
[03:10:44.220 --> 03:10:45.220]   All right.
[03:10:45.220 --> 03:10:47.140]   Do on the Twit, baby.
[03:10:47.140 --> 03:10:47.940]   Do on the Twit.
[03:10:47.940 --> 03:10:49.020]   All right.
[03:10:49.020 --> 03:10:50.860]   Do on the Twit, baby.
