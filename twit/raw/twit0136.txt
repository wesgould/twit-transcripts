[00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.920]   It's time for Twit this week in tech and this week,
[00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.720]   Steve Gilmore joining us once again from the news gang.
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.600]   He did not bring along his friend Dave Weiner,
[00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.200]   so you may continue to listen.
[00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.640]   Hello. Hello.
[00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.280]   Steve is now, I might add, Chief Blogging Officer at E-Week magazine.
[00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.880]   Well, I don't know about Chief because I'm the only blogging officer.
[00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.000]   You have to have more than one in order to have a Chief.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.440]   All Chief, no Indians.
[00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:19.480]   Exactly.
[00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.840]   But we can read your blog now at e-week.com?
[00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.480]   Yeah, blog.e-week.com/news-cang.
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:26.720]   That's great.
[00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.920]   And of course, he's got his head, his own blog for a long time,
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.120]   Gesture Lab, which is a great blog about the attention economy
[00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.480]   and gestures, which one of these days you'll have to explain how that works
[00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.480]   because I don't really understand gestures.
[00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.280]   Just about how everybody's making money these days, but other than that.
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.480]   That's why I don't understand it.
[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.840]   Now I understand why I don't understand it.
[00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.240]   Also here, johnc.vorac.org/blog.
[00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.480]   He's an expert on making money.
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:53.680]   Now like you, Leo.
[00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.080]   I'm raking it in, John.
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.920]   I got the dough, baby.
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:04.200]   I ask everybody who listens for $2 donations and you know, I am making millions of months.
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.040]   That's why Tony Robbins is coming up here on Thursday to see my operation.
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:09.920]   See how it works.
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:10.920]   You're kidding.
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.000]   No, I'm not kidding.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.120]   The Tony Roberts?
[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.600]   Not Tony Roberts, the Broadway actor and star of many--
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.600]   No, Tony Roberts.
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:18.600]   The tall guy.
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:19.600]   The tall guy.
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:20.600]   Yeah.
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:21.600]   The self-help guy?
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.600]   Yeah.
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.600]   That's my most personal friend.
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.600]   No.
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:25.880]   No, he's where Amber's working with him.
[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.400]   I think I maybe misunderstood this, but I got the impression that he was going to join
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.520]   her and take a tour of this new studio that we're building downstairs.
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.080]   I'm bump his head.
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.080]   I know.
[00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.240]   I'm worrying about the ceilings now.

[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.360]   I'm sorry, Steve.
[00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.360]   Do me to use that word.
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.360]   That's all right.
[00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.120]   You're the only one who went to South by Southwest.
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.120]   Yeah, I know.
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.360]   I was kind of expecting you to be there.
[00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.720]   I really wanted to be there.
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:56.720]   I've never been.
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:57.720]   I know you're busy.
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.220]   I had a conflict.
[00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.560]   Tell me, you know, what it looked like on Twitter, and I know there were people on Twitter
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.680]   who were getting very irate about it, is it like just a big frat party?
[00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:07.680]   I don't know.
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.300]   I wouldn't call it a frat party, but there was a lot of partying to be had, but I can
[00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.800]   understand how Twitter users were probably sick and tired of hearing about it from all
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:16.800]   of us here.
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.320]   Most of the posts on Twitter are, "I'm at party A, but I'm going to party B now."
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.320]   Yeah, I think it's kind of exciting.
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.320]   It's 9 in the morning.
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:25.840]   You guys were just having a great time.
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:26.840]   I've always wanted to go.
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:33.040]   It's kind of a gathering of the Web 2.0 clans, and I think everybody is there who's Web 2.0
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.040]   celebrity, right?
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.640]   It's really nice to see everyone at all in one place, for sure.
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.640]   Real faces.
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:45.520]   We addressed the Sarah Lacey Mark Zuckerberg interview kerfuffle last week.
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.560]   In fact, we had, it was breaking, actually, as we were doing the show last week, because
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.440]   it happened last Sunday, and Scoble called in and gave us kind of a live update.
[00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.000]   Were you in the room there?
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.080]   I wasn't there now.
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.080]   You skipped it.
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.080]   Mm-hmm.
[00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.080]   What did you go see and said?
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.720]   I was actually at lunch at the time.
[00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.720]   It was, I think it was at 2 o'clock, and so I went to go get some food, and I ended up
[00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.440]   going further away from the convention center than I expected and didn't make it back in
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:08.440]   time.
[00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.160]   So you're farther, far enough away you didn't hear the jeers, the cat calls, the screams,
[00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.320]   the yells, the terror.
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.400]   No, but I did see the Twitter updates, but I guess if you weren't there, you couldn't
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.960]   get the full experience of the whole thing.
[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:19.560]   Yeah, no kidding.
[00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.000]   What's your reaction to the whole thing?
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.160]   At first, based on what I heard from the blogs and from the Twitters, I was like, "Wow,
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.960]   that must have gone really badly."
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.960]   And then when I actually watched the video on YouTube and the clips that I saw, I'm like,
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.680]   "Wow, they kind of picked on her more than they needed to."
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.160]   The attacks seemed way more strongly worded than were necessary.
[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:45.080]   So, I felt bad for her, and it is a hard thing to do to get up in front of that many
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:50.200]   people and try to do an interview style to kind of pull a mark out of his shell, which
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.280]   I've heard is very difficult to do.
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.080]   But I think the reaction way over weighed her wrongdoings.
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.280]   A lot of people are watching the video are saying that, and you can't really tell that
[00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:01.800]   people are that upset.
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.080]   Mm-hmm, but then her response and her kind of reaction, I don't know.
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.720]   She didn't do herself any favors.
[00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.440]   She did not do any favors.
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.400]   She should have just said, "Gosh, I'm sorry I went badly.
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:14.400]   I feel terrible.
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.400]   I'm going to do a great job.
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:16.600]   I'll try to do better next time."
[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.200]   Instead, she was very defensive.
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:22.000]   And the worst thing, she said one thing I know that an irk you, and I'll let you address
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   that.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.800]   The thing that irked me, she said, "Well, they'll never get any A-list people at South by Southwest
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:27.800]   again."
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:28.800]   [laughter]
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:34.960]   As if somehow that was, the flaw was in the audience.
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.520]   I can't really speak for the audience because I wasn't there.
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:42.040]   I didn't see the reactions firsthand, but it did seem like they kind of blew up when
[00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.840]   they didn't need to.
[00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:49.120]   I don't think that's going to affect who they get at South by Southwest next year at all.
[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.760]   John, you want to zip it up?
[00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.480]   We're trying to do a show here.
[00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:56.240]   What was that?
[00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.800]   He's packing up.
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:59.800]   He's taking off.
[00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:00.800]   I don't even...
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:05.000]   Actually, I'm trying to clean up around here.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.520]   You didn't know how loud that was going to be, did you?
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:08.800]   No, it's pretty cool.
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.200]   I could probably record that as a sound effect.
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:18.200]   Yeah, but to represent what?
[00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:20.720]   What you really want to do is do the zip slowly.
[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.200]   You want to do the zip slowly?
[00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:23.200]   Yeah.
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:24.200]   Hang on.
[00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:25.200]   Like...
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:26.200]   [laughter]
[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:27.200]   How about that?
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:34.200]   Actually, the sound of water running would be good.
[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:35.200]   There you go.
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:36.200]   All right.
[00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:37.200]   Now let's stop right here.
[00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.200]   This is not a morning zoo.
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:39.200]   Let's go to the truck.
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.200]   For Veronica's going, "What am I doing here?
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:42.200]   Help me.
[00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:43.200]   Get me out of here."
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:46.200]   Steve, what was your reaction when you watched all this going on?
[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:52.040]   I just wanted to turn off Twitter and run away, but unfortunately I'm addicted to Twitter
[00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.200]   so I couldn't...
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:55.200]   It was kind of a brutal lynching, wasn't it?
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:59.200]   Well, the thing is that Zuckerberg is not exactly...
[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:04.200]   To say that he's a difficult interview is really kind of not putting it correctly.
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:06.040]   He's an impossible interview.
[00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:07.200]   He never says anything.
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:08.200]   Yeah.
[00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:09.200]   So...
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:12.200]   That's why we don't have executives on this show, frankly.
[00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:14.200]   Well, I think he's...
[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:17.200]   It's not like he's been told by somebody not to talk.
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:19.200]   I just don't think he wants to.
[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:20.200]   Right.
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:23.200]   You know, there's some suspicion he's been told by the CIA not to talk.
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:24.200]   What?
[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:25.200]   No way.
[00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:27.200]   What are they using Facebook to keep track of known...
[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:30.880]   I'm just saying, you know, if I was up there interviewing, I would ask him the question about
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:34.440]   the rumor going around that the CIA is the guys that are actually running this thing,
[00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:37.440]   or they're the ones who are financing it or fineness in the early days.
[00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:38.440]   Wait a minute.
[00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:39.440]   Really?
[00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:40.440]   You haven't heard this?
[00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:41.440]   No.
[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:42.440]   I have.
[00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:43.440]   I have heard this either.
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:44.440]   I have heard it.
[00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:45.440]   Walked them all the way about it.
[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:46.440]   She knows about it.
[00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:47.440]   Yeah, Molly.
[00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:48.440]   What would be the first...
[00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:49.440]   He does.
[00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:51.440]   I brought it up with her and she says, "Yeah, I can't believe that nobody brings it up
[00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:54.440]   and when they start interviewing him, at least have him deny it."
[00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:56.440]   Why would the CIA invest in Facebook?
[00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:57.440]   Oh, please.
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:58.440]   Access.
[00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:00.440]   Access to people's information?
[00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:01.440]   Yeah.
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:03.440]   To know who's stooping whom?
[00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:05.440]   Sam, putting the tin foil hat on now.
[00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:11.080]   Hey, there's got to be a lot of terrorists or terrorists wannabes or people that use Facebook
[00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:14.160]   for other purposes from maybe overseas.
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.520]   Facebook's a really good platform for like cells.
[00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:19.160]   I mean, not that I think this is true.
[00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.880]   I'm just telling you, this is a question I'd be asking.
[00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:25.800]   I would think they'd be more likely to finance something like Bibo or MySpace, where they're
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:28.400]   really... where people really are kind of out there and saying stuff.
[00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:30.480]   I guess you feel more secure on Facebook.
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:33.480]   You're more likely to say, "Hey, let's get together and make a pipe bomb."
[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:37.760]   You and me, we'll go there and we'll blow up the embassy.
[00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:38.760]   What do you say?
[00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:39.760]   Come on now.
[00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:40.760]   Is this kind of a Russian ad?
[00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:42.520]   I don't know what are these ad ways.
[00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:46.560]   I'm trying to be kind of indistinct so that nobody will take offense.
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:48.200]   No, yeah, that's you.
[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:49.200]   It could be...
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:52.800]   If I had that range of voices, well, I'd be offended everybody.
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:54.360]   It could be Israeli.
[00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:55.360]   It could be Russian.
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:56.360]   It could be air.
[00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:57.360]   It could be anything.
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:59.960]   It could be whoever the bad guy of the du jour is.
[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:02.920]   Well, anyway, to take it back to the conversation a little bit, I think...
[00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:03.920]   Why?
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:04.920]   Why?
[00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:05.920]   We're getting so hilarious.
[00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:06.920]   Why talk about seriously?
[00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:07.920]   Why is that?
[00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:08.920]   No.
[00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:10.720]   No, please, Veronica, get us back on track.
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:15.080]   Back in the days when it was just like an IRC back channel kind of discussion, this kind
[00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:17.080]   of thing never would have made it out in the August period.
[00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:18.080]   Well, that's true.
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:19.080]   It's because of Twitter.
[00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:20.080]   Yeah.
[00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:22.120]   I think Twitter is possibly wholly to blame for the whole debacle.
[00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:23.120]   Twitter's really amazing.
[00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:24.360]   I mean, it became...
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:26.320]   It came out at South by Southwest last year.
[00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:28.960]   Of course, it was already well known, so there was no way it was going to come out this
[00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:31.880]   year, but it ended up being the story once again.
[00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:32.880]   It was the...
[00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:34.360]   Twitter was the killer app again, I would say.
[00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:35.760]   You either that or rock band?
[00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:40.720]   Yeah, I kept rating people who are using rock band and guitar hero in all the booths.
[00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:43.480]   Every single booth had either rock band or guitar hero 3.
[00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:46.400]   Every party had rock band or guitar hero 3.
[00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:51.840]   It was just kind of sitting out on the convention floor just out there for everyone to play.
[00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:53.040]   It was kind of weird.
[00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:55.840]   It's the karaoke of your generation.
[00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:56.840]   I suppose, yeah.
[00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:57.840]   I think it is.
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:59.600]   It would be just as embarrassed in a few years.
[00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:00.600]   No way.
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:01.760]   Did your band play?
[00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:03.280]   Oh, yeah, we did.
[00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:04.480]   Tell us about the band.
[00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:12.360]   Well, I have a rock band band with Casey McKinnon, Leah Culver, and Bonnie Piersona.
[00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:13.360]   Wow.
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:16.280]   And we played at the Tumblr Next New Networks party.
[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:17.280]   Is there video?
[00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:19.000]   Oh, there's definitely video.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.120]   Yeah, I put it up on pounds and also Casey has it up on her blog.
[00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:27.200]   There's a YouTube video, but you get to see all our frustration as our Xbox 360 pretty
[00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:29.400]   much went fubar.
[00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:33.960]   And we had to keep restarting and then there was disc errors and then it wasn't synced
[00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:34.960]   up properly.
[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:37.640]   Finally, we rocked it out and it was a lot of fun.
[00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:40.440]   So what is Tumblr anyway?
[00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:43.800]   Tumblr is kind of like microblogging, I guess, in a sense.
[00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:45.520]   It's just like a mini blog.
[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:46.520]   Tumblr?
[00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:47.520]   Not Twitter.
[00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:48.520]   Yeah.
[00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:49.520]   Tumblr.
[00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:54.280]   You know, the whole idea started with, what is it?
[00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:55.280]   Iconoclast.
[00:10:55.280 --> 00:11:01.440]   I can't remember now the site, Projectionist, p-r-o-dot-j-c-t-i-o-n-dot-i-s-t.
[00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:06.240]   The whole idea was it's a blog, but more like bits.
[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:07.640]   There's no commenting.
[00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:08.640]   People just throw up.
[00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:13.000]   It's kind of closer to the original link blog idea than anything else.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.360]   It's kind of an activator and a sense to you.
[00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:16.360]   Yeah.
[00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:17.360]   Sort of delicious competitors.
[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:19.360]   No, no, no, no.
[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:20.360]   No.
[00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:23.360]   You go to Projectionist, I think probably if you just Google Projectionist, you can
[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:25.640]   find it because I didn't spell it very well.
[00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:29.920]   It's project.io and I.st.
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:31.720]   I got the dots in the wrong place.
[00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:33.680]   Oh, and it also is down.
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:38.760]   But the problem with Projectionist was what they were doing required some really custom
[00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:39.760]   template programming.
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:40.840]   And I tried myself.
[00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:42.480]   There was a rails version of this.
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:44.040]   I never was able to get working.
[00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:48.360]   All of a sudden, along comes, is it Dave?
[00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:50.080]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:51.080]   Hold on a second.
[00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:52.080]   Before we do that, let's add Patrick.
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:55.520]   Mr. Patrick Norton has just joined a club.
[00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:56.520]   Hello, Patrick.
[00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:58.320]   Hey, everybody.
[00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:00.920]   Congratulations to put the baby to bed.
[00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:02.880]   Well, I don't know about that.
[00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:03.880]   The baby's nursing.
[00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:05.840]   All right.
[00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:06.840]   Not nursing you.
[00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:10.320]   No, you don't have one of those manzier things.
[00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:12.160]   No, I hold a bottle.
[00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:13.560]   You know they make those?
[00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:14.560]   Yes.
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:17.360]   Yes, there's a lot of things they make that will never happen.
[00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:19.760]   To give men the experience of nursing.
[00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:22.240]   Anyway, that's enough of that.
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:26.700]   Remember talking to your wife about her swollen breasts and the feeling she had before the
[00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:28.400]   endorphin release during the nursing?
[00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:29.400]   Yeah.
[00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:30.400]   I don't think the manzier really qualifies.
[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:32.000]   No, none of that.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.800]   You get none of that benefit.
[00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:34.800]   I'm sorry.
[00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:37.360]   We're making nine joyous, perky months of pregnancy.
[00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:40.720]   I don't think they've developed a man simulator for that either.
[00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:42.120]   We're making Veronica nauseous.
[00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:45.040]   I actually, I think she actually went off and barfed.
[00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:46.440]   Well, actually, let me say something here.
[00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:49.720]   I think it's interesting that Veronica brings up the point about us getting back on
[00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:53.640]   subject rather than talking about the CIA and Facebook and we end up talking about her
[00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:55.640]   band and man boobs.
[00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:56.640]   You know what?
[00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:59.600]   Veronica's working for the CIA.
[00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:03.440]   We finally got that out of the closet here.
[00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:06.080]   She's a covert operative.
[00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:07.920]   All right, I'll give you one.
[00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:14.280]   Now that Patrick's here is CNET buying revision three for $57 million?
[00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:16.280]   $57 million?
[00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:17.280]   Yeah.
[00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:18.280]   Wow.
[00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:19.280]   You didn't see that?
[00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:23.040]   No, the first time I heard this, it was for $7 million and I told somebody, I just fell
[00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:26.320]   in the sleep because my allergies kicked in on Friday and I get this phone call like
[00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:27.320]   nine o'clock.
[00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:30.840]   It's like, dude, heard you guys were being bought and I was like, what?
[00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:32.440]   He's like, it's on Twitter.
[00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:34.920]   You're being bought for $7 million Twitter.
[00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:35.920]   Like $1 million.
[00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:38.600]   Don't don't don't waste my time, dude.
[00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:40.160]   I'm going back to sleep now.
[00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:41.160]   I have no idea.
[00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:43.120]   My favorite thing was on the on the blog post that I saw about it.
[00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:48.880]   The first comment was Jay Adelson saying, um, no, he says, we don't normally comment
[00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:51.480]   on these things, but, um, no.
[00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:58.440]   If Jay Adelson, our beloved chairman of the board and co-founder has seen fit to comment
[00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:01.080]   on it, uh, it's probably Adelson.
[00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:04.920]   Uh, if Jay, if Jay's already commented on it, I have nothing to add.
[00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:08.400]   There's nothing of use I can add to that.
[00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:14.400]   I think that David Prager was confirming it briefly, but I thought we were, I think he
[00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:18.840]   was joking around again on Twitter.
[00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:21.920]   I think that when somebody should have played the game and no, no, we're buying them.
[00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:24.520]   If it's on the internet, it's true.
[00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:27.240]   And then the punchline would be for $7 million.
[00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:28.240]   Yeah.
[00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:29.880]   Well, have you been following them?
[00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:34.080]   The CNET board is very unhappy with, uh, with the way CNET's been run.
[00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:36.840]   They're, they, of course, they brought in Dan Farber.
[00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:40.960]   Um, but I think you're going to see more changes at CNET, don't you think?
[00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:43.960]   I thought Barbara, Barbara, has been there for years.
[00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:45.760]   Farber was at ZDNet.
[00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:49.760]   Oh, the subsidiary have been not actually part of CNET.
[00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:52.860]   And they, uh, uh, uh, what's his name retired?
[00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:54.840]   You probably worked for him, Veronica, at one point.
[00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:55.840]   Yeah.
[00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:56.840]   Yeah.
[00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:57.840]   Yeah.
[00:14:57.840 --> 00:14:58.840]   Yeah.
[00:14:58.840 --> 00:14:59.840]   Jay Singh retired to be, you spend more time with his family, which I think, on, on, on,
[00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:04.040]   that's, that's the common cliche for when somebody's in fire, but in fact, that's actually
[00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:05.040]   what happened.
[00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:06.040]   Yeah.
[00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:08.920]   Actually, I like the common cliche where he quits so he could have less time with his
[00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:09.920]   family.
[00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:10.920]   Ha ha ha ha.
[00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:11.920]   Less time with you guys.
[00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:15.720]   Uh, and then they Dan Farber, they brought Dan Farber in, who I think a very good move.
[00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:17.680]   Was it, no, I'm not sorry, not Dan Farber.
[00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:18.680]   Yes.
[00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:19.680]   Dan Farber.
[00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:20.680]   It was Dan Farber.
[00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:21.680]   Yeah.
[00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:23.320]   You would know that Steve, because he's a regular on the gang.
[00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:24.320]   Yes.
[00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:27.600]   Dan Farber is now editor in chief of news.com.
[00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:29.080]   But do you know what's going on at CNET?
[00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:30.080]   Has he talked about it?
[00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:31.080]   Have you got any insights, Steve?
[00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:33.120]   That's a subsidiary of CNET.
[00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:37.160]   That's not, that doesn't, that means he's running one particular business unit inside
[00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:38.160]   of CNET.
[00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:39.160]   Yeah.
[00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:41.160]   I mean, he's a VP of, uh, uh, CNET.
[00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:44.800]   But that's a big change for the news department, but I think there's even more, the board seems
[00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:49.080]   unhappy with CNET stock performance and, uh, and in general with the way it's being
[00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:50.080]   run, right?
[00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:53.280]   Am I the only person who's been reading this?
[00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:56.280]   No, we, you know, that's all we know.
[00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:57.280]   Yeah.
[00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:01.200]   There's a, there's a company, the real problem is there's a bunch of, uh, raiders back in
[00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:04.840]   New York that are trying to, uh, who bought a bunch of scene and they're trying to jack
[00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:08.160]   the price up and they're, and they're trying to get new people put on the board.
[00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:09.160]   They think the board's incompetent.
[00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:13.800]   And a lot of it has to do with the ones Shelby left, you know, they, some of the vision went
[00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:18.080]   away and, uh, you know, cause, and they've got all kinds of these weird initiatives,
[00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:23.040]   like BNET and a whole bunch of other little kind of little, yeah, BNET.
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:24.040]   You don't even know about it.
[00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:25.560]   I mean, it's not very well marketed.
[00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:26.560]   Yeah.
[00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:27.560]   BNET.
[00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:28.560]   What's that?
[00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:29.560]   It's like, it's, it's a business network.
[00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:30.560]   It's like CNET only is BNET.
[00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:31.560]   Yeah.
[00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:33.560]   They have a lot of whiteboards and things like that.
[00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:41.320]   And they, and they, and they have a, yeah, and then they have a tech republic, which is
[00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:42.320]   actually does.
[00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:44.200]   And tech republic, actually, yeah.
[00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:47.440]   You know, and so they, so there's, you know, they think maybe there's maybe a little
[00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:49.200]   lot, lack of focus.
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:50.200]   I don't know.
[00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:53.600]   I think the, I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that I think Yahoo suffers
[00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:59.400]   from this is I think there's a slowdown in the, uh, in the effectiveness of online advertising
[00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:00.400]   at the moment.
[00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:01.400]   Ah.
[00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:07.200]   Yeah, but, but CNET stock price has got hammered back in the dot bomb and, and it's been suffering
[00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:08.200]   ever since.
[00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:12.840]   And I remember any of my friends suddenly selling their CNET stock and, uh, you know,
[00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:14.320]   buying houses in the last seven years.
[00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:15.680]   No, I got, we got some.
[00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:17.200]   No, I take, no, that's not true.
[00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:20.480]   I, I think, I think if you look with the last couple of years, it was up in the thirties
[00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:21.480]   or something like that.
[00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:22.480]   And it's only recently.
[00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:23.480]   No.
[00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:24.480]   No.
[00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:25.480]   No.
[00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:26.480]   No.
[00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:27.480]   No.
[00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:28.480]   No.
[00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:29.480]   No.
[00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:30.480]   No.
[00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:31.480]   No.
[00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:32.480]   I'm going to the internet.
[00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:33.480]   Yeah.
[00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:34.480]   Veronica, you should go.
[00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:35.480]   No.
[00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:36.480]   I'm, I'm looking for a little more.
[00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:37.480]   She was no.
[00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:38.480]   I'm going to the tech crunch.
[00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:43.640]   CNET board has quote tents, uncomfortable meeting with Jana consortium.
[00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:48.400]   Jana has about 21% of the company from what we hear says, Mike, the meeting didn't go
[00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:49.400]   so well.
[00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:50.840]   Quote, it was tense and uncomfortable.
[00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:55.080]   Said one source, the CNET board is quote in a state of denial, end quote about the seriousness
[00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:56.080]   of the situation.
[00:17:56.080 --> 00:18:00.280]   Said another, um, CNET stock slumping.
[00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:04.280]   Well, yeah, I, I would defer to Veronica's, uh, cause she was at the company for a while.
[00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:07.440]   So she probably understands that the stock was a lot, not as high as I thought.
[00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:10.520]   But the point is, is what can they do about it?
[00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:13.760]   Well, Veronica being an ex-employee might have some ideas.
[00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:14.760]   What's wrong with CNET?
[00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:15.760]   Oh, geez.
[00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:17.560]   That's a big question to be asking me.
[00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:19.920]   Um, I don't really know.
[00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:22.560]   I mean, CNET TV was doing really well when I was there.
[00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:24.840]   And that was the area that I worked in.
[00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:28.320]   In terms of their business stuff, I'm probably the wrong person to ask.
[00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:30.280]   I like the content on CNET TV.
[00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:31.440]   I think it's, it's well done.
[00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:32.440]   I think Tom Merritt's great.
[00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:33.440]   Yeah.
[00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:34.440]   Well, they're doing a great job too.
[00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:35.440]   Molly's great.
[00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:38.840]   I'm programming from, um, you know, Geek Entertainment TV.
[00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:41.160]   I believe some revision three stuff is on there.
[00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:42.160]   Is that correct Patrick?
[00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:44.160]   As a matter of fact, Texille Daley's on there.
[00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:46.000]   Which is awesome because I'll be on there on Thursday.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   I mean, on Tuesday.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   By the way, I, I neglected to mention when we were covering the Sarah Lacey story that
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.440]   John, you're going to have Sarah on the cranky geeks on Wednesday, yes?
[00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:57.640]   Uh, it's not going to be the run.
[00:18:57.640 --> 00:18:59.320]   We run on Wednesday.
[00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:02.680]   On Wednesday, we've got a show actually it's kind of a throwback show where I think we
[00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:05.920]   have a couple of our ex, ex people on.
[00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:10.240]   Um, and it's going to be an evergreen show we're going to do afterwards.
[00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:15.040]   So either run the week either run the next Wednesday or maybe a week after that.
[00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:16.560]   So it's going to, it's not going to be the normal new story.
[00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:20.040]   It's going to be one of our typical, you know, we get some people and talk about issues.
[00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:21.040]   Great.
[00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:24.000]   And I presume about the Zuckerberg keynote.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   Yeah.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   Well, it'll be in there.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.080]   I'm not going to focus on it by any means.
[00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:32.640]   But, uh, we're going to talk, I want to talk about my idea is to talk about the effect
[00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:37.880]   of Twitter, uh, the better again with Twitter slowly I turned.
[00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:42.280]   And here's the thing that, that, because when I did the years ago when the Des Moines,
[00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:47.080]   uh, go, gnome decks was still running before I moved it out here, it was the beginning
[00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:52.160]   of this, of this period where people you'd go, you give a talk to these people, this group
[00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:53.520]   and nobody's looking up.
[00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:56.960]   Nobody's looking at anything you're saying they're all blogging at the time.
[00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:58.840]   Now it's, they're all Twittering, not all of them.
[00:19:58.840 --> 00:19:59.840]   Sure.
[00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:02.040]   There's a couple of people that aren't, but generally speaking, there's so many of them
[00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:07.400]   that are Twittering and blogging is creating a awkward situation for public speakers.
[00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:08.400]   I agree with that.
[00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:09.560]   Well, it's not just Twitter.
[00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:13.960]   I mean, you, the minute you start to speak in front of a group now, they're all these
[00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:15.480]   laptops in front of you.
[00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:16.480]   Life looking going on.
[00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:17.480]   Yeah.
[00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:18.480]   They're all looking well.
[00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:21.960]   And even if it's not a geek group, I mean, I just spoke to a radio convention and, uh,
[00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:24.480]   they're, they weren't geeks necessarily, but they all have their laptops over.
[00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:26.800]   And you know, they're reading blogs or playing a solitaire.
[00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:27.800]   They're all doing something else.
[00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:34.560]   Well, I think the exact opposite, I think that it's a blight on us laptop users that we are
[00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:37.160]   interrupt by the, you know, idiots.
[00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:39.400]   I'll go with it.
[00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:40.400]   I'll go with you on that.
[00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:42.960]   Why do you even go into the audience then, Steve?
[00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:44.680]   That's the point that I would like to make.
[00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:45.680]   I don't.
[00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:46.680]   I don't.
[00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:50.000]   I say, well, then you should stay out, but why are people going in or can they find any
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.360]   place else to sit down?
[00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:52.360]   Is that the problem?
[00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:53.520]   I think that's it.
[00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:54.760]   It's just a nice place to sit.
[00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:55.760]   Maybe they'll give you some more.
[00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:56.760]   It's all about power strips, John.
[00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:57.760]   What's it all about?
[00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:03.760]   After you've paid your $705,000 to attend your five day conference, you want to make sure
[00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:05.080]   you keep that seat warm.
[00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:06.080]   Actually, here's the theory.
[00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:07.440]   We're just doing email.
[00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:08.440]   Here's the theory.
[00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:10.120]   This comes from Dr. Irving Bidermer.
[00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:14.880]   I'm sorry, Bider Man, a neuroscientist at the University of Southern California and
[00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:18.760]   actually Lee Gomes wrote about it in the Wall Street Journal this week.
[00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:26.560]   He's, he's, he basically his premise is that our evolutionary and biological imperative,
[00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:30.200]   we, it makes it, we have a human need for information.
[00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:34.240]   We can't stop grazing web data.
[00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:38.800]   So what he did, he first he got some volunteers test subjects, showed him photographs of a
[00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:40.200]   variety of things.
[00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:42.840]   The subjects preferred a certain kind of pictures.
[00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:48.840]   For instance, monkeys in a tree or a group of houses along a river over things like an
[00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:51.240]   empty parking lot or a pile of old paint cans.
[00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:57.560]   Now, it turns out the pictures they liked best had certain common features like a good
[00:21:57.560 --> 00:22:01.480]   vantage on a landscape and an element of mystery.
[00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:07.520]   In some way or other, Dr. Biderman said they all presented new information that somehow
[00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:09.840]   needed to be interpreted.
[00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:14.160]   He then hooked up people to brain scanning machines and he found in fact, those mysterious
[00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:18.760]   shots are the ones you had to think about cause more brain activity, obviously than a parking
[00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:23.960]   lot full of paint cans, which all of this seems fairly obvious.
[00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:30.360]   But his theory is that biologically we're used, we're, we're tuned to scan the horizon
[00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:35.840]   looking for saber tooth tigers and, and gather information that will help us in survival.
[00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:41.200]   And he says, that's exactly why students can't sit down anymore without having more
[00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:42.680]   inputs all the time.
[00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:44.840]   We need that information flow.
[00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:46.640]   The bigger the flow, the better.
[00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:47.880]   Does that make sense?
[00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:49.560]   It's a biological importance.
[00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:53.760]   It's not your child's lack of discipline or respect for his peers.
[00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:58.200]   It's the fact that he's biologically tuned to be Twitter into his friends during class.
[00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:01.040]   It's a crock of crap is what it is.
[00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:04.440]   This is the new, this is the new media theory when Elliot Spitzer has problems.
[00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:05.440]   It's all biology.
[00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:07.120]   We're all controlled by our biology.
[00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:08.720]   It's a crock of crap is all it is.
[00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:10.640]   I mean, we've always been wanting to be distracted.
[00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:11.640]   What difference does it make?
[00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:14.320]   I mean, you just, that's where you say, hey, sit down and pay attention.
[00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:16.440]   You have to tell people that you always had to.
[00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:18.680]   People would like to read books in the back of classrooms.
[00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:20.480]   Howard Rine goes doing an interesting thing.
[00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:22.440]   He's teaching a class right now.
[00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:24.880]   He realized he said, nobody's paying attention to me.
[00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:29.960]   So the first day he says, close your laptops for the next hour and just think.
[00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:34.520]   I mean, I don't know how the class must be hating it, but he's trying to address this
[00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:37.200]   and say, what is it that is grabbing your attention?
[00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:38.200]   What is going on here?
[00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:40.080]   And is this a good thing?
[00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:42.880]   In my high school, the class weren't paying attention.
[00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:47.080]   The teacher would pick up a chalk, put it eraser and fling it.
[00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:48.480]   Whoever was writing notes.
[00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:50.080]   I had that same teacher.
[00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:51.740]   Did he also say life isn't fair?
[00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:53.520]   What makes you think life is fair?
[00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:55.520]   No, that was a different professor.
[00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:57.440]   That was my...
[00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:59.520]   Well, all right.
[00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:03.520]   So you don't think we're wired to be gathering all this stuff all the time?
[00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:07.640]   You know, but we may be wired to be gathering all this stuff, but in theory, we're wired
[00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:09.200]   to do a lot of other stuff.
[00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:13.840]   And, you know, we can...
[00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:16.840]   Why are we just have sex in class?
[00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:19.640]   We're wired to get drunk and to fornicate all the time.
[00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:21.080]   So let's break down society.
[00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:22.640]   Can I get in that class?
[00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:24.280]   Yeah, I want to be in that class.
[00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:25.280]   You're in that class.
[00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:26.280]   Are you human, sir?
[00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:28.240]   Then you're wired to get drunk and to fornicate.
[00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:29.600]   And that's what you should be doing.
[00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:32.720]   Because self-discipline is not really necessary in the 21st century.
[00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:34.560]   It's so classy that you say fornicate.
[00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:35.560]   Isn't he great?
[00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:36.560]   Thank you.
[00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:37.560]   Thank you very much.
[00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:39.120]   He's the doctor Laura of this show.
[00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:42.640]   I want you to ever call me Dr. Laura again, or I will publicly spank you.
[00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:44.000]   Well, that could be good.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.480]   We'll save that for Twit Live later once we start doing video.
[00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:48.080]   Make some money on that deal.
[00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:49.080]   Facebook, I'm sorry.
[00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:51.520]   The CIA is launching an instant messaging service.
[00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:52.520]   Did you see this?
[00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:53.520]   I am on...
[00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:54.520]   I mean, talk...
[00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:59.720]   I mean, okay, this supports the contention that kids nowadays need 18 things going on
[00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:00.720]   at the same time.
[00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:02.960]   They're going to use Jabber.
[00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:05.720]   You'll be able to use standard instant messaging clients.
[00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:10.600]   My kid already uses MySpace as I am basically.
[00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:11.600]   Facebook is going that way too.
[00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:13.920]   Well, this is another Twitter story.
[00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:14.920]   Is it a Twitter story?
[00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:15.920]   Of course, sorry, Veronica.
[00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:16.920]   I interrupted you.
[00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:17.920]   That's okay.
[00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:18.920]   Go ahead.
[00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:21.120]   I was just saying it's constant partial attention.
[00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:24.520]   We're always talking in five different ways, if not more.
[00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:28.320]   And Twitter is just kind of a symptom of that at this point.
[00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:30.600]   Is that bad or good?
[00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:32.200]   I think it's bad.
[00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:35.680]   I mean, I just haven't figured out how to parse all that information yet in a way that
[00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:36.680]   it's effective.
[00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:41.200]   I mean, I'm getting so many different streams of information all at one time from Twitter,
[00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:44.160]   Pounce, RSS feeds, instant messaging.
[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:45.600]   Where do you turn it off?
[00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:47.440]   It is getting worse, isn't it?
[00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:49.120]   It's getting much worse.
[00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:50.960]   Is it a symptom or an accelerant?
[00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:54.280]   Probably an accelerant, yeah, to put it better.
[00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:56.280]   What do you mean an accelerant?
[00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:57.280]   Well, it's...
[00:25:57.280 --> 00:25:58.280]   More difficult.
[00:25:58.280 --> 00:25:59.280]   It's making it more...
[00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:00.280]   I don't know.
[00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:02.320]   I mean, there used to be a barrier of entry, right?
[00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:03.420]   Could you afford a cell phone?
[00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:06.640]   If you couldn't afford a cell phone, then you only got phone calls when you were at home
[00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:07.640]   or at work.
[00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:09.740]   Then you got a cell phone, you get cell phones at any time.
[00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:11.780]   And then email became a primary business tool.
[00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:14.500]   But you have to have a computer for email and suddenly your cell phone can kind of do
[00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:17.580]   email and then somebody comes up with Twitter, which is faster than email.
[00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:18.580]   Or, you know what I mean?
[00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:21.620]   So you're saying it's a vicious circle?
[00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:22.820]   Vicious cycle, maybe.
[00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:24.820]   Vicious accelerant, vicious...
[00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:25.820]   Viral.
[00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:27.620]   Yeah, I don't see it as proliferating.
[00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:29.180]   I think it's simplifying.
[00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:30.180]   Really?
[00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:33.380]   Yeah, Twitter is taking over much of those functions.
[00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:34.380]   You know, we talk about...
[00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:37.180]   The last three shows we've spent a lot of time talking about Twitter and I think there's
[00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:38.180]   a real divide.
[00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:42.520]   It's certainly in our audience there's a divide among people who are Twitter users
[00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:46.940]   and interested in this and people who just say, "What are you talking about?
[00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:49.540]   Why is Twitter worth spending any energy talking about?
[00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:50.540]   Is it that important?
[00:26:50.540 --> 00:26:54.260]   Or is it just a bunch of A-listers talking to each other?"
[00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:55.260]   Yeah.
[00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:56.940]   It's the same thing about Christ.
[00:26:56.940 --> 00:26:58.420]   Inside baseball.
[00:26:58.420 --> 00:26:59.420]   Is it?
[00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:00.660]   No, I don't think it is.
[00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:02.660]   And I'm not...okay, let's put it this way.
[00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:04.340]   I find the whole thing abhorrent.
[00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:05.660]   I don't like Twitter.
[00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:06.660]   I don't use it.
[00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:10.140]   I read these things that people put up on Twitter from people I know like you and everyone
[00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:13.060]   else that uses it and I read these inane comments.
[00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:15.180]   I think it's the stupidest thing I've ever seen.
[00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:17.340]   But I think it's somehow important.
[00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:20.140]   I'm hearing Cass read this through his brain.
[00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:23.020]   When John says it's the stupidest thing I ever see.
[00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:26.740]   I love that every time I go on a podcast with John, we have the same argument every
[00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:27.740]   single time.
[00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:28.740]   It's just in frames differently.
[00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:30.140]   I love that he hates it.
[00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:32.780]   It's always framed differently.
[00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:34.500]   It's compelling though in some ways to its users.
[00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:36.020]   You see what Callicannus is doing?
[00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:40.380]   He's offering a MacBook Air if he gets to 20,000 followers.
[00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:42.100]   He's basically trying to buy followers.
[00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:43.780]   But you know, it makes sense for him.
[00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:46.060]   And I know this is the calculus he's going through.
[00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:50.500]   If he can get 20,000 people to follow his every word on Twitter, that's hugely valuable
[00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:51.500]   to him.
[00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:52.900]   I think that we should be the next Robert Skope.
[00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:53.900]   Oops, sorry.
[00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:54.900]   I'm sorry.
[00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:59.660]   I think we should get Skowble to get 25,000, which will force Jason to have to fill it,
[00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:00.660]   give away another air.
[00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:01.660]   A Tesla.
[00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:03.500]   He's going to have to give away a Tesla.
[00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:08.140]   Oh, this is Steve thinking, you know, like the Mercantile guy that he actually is.
[00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:09.580]   This is a great idea.
[00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:12.380]   If you can keep cranking up Skowble's numbers, it'll be a Callicannus.
[00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:16.340]   It'll be chasing him forever, giving away more and more stuff.
[00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:17.340]   Exactly.
[00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:22.620]   So everybody's smart, they should follow both Callicannus and Skowble.
[00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:23.620]   Exactly.
[00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:26.340]   We're double up on Skowble with some phonemials.
[00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:29.860]   Leo comes in quietly and steals them all.
[00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:30.860]   I'm not saying a word.
[00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:31.860]   I'm just sitting here.
[00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:36.580]   I'm up to 10,109 followers, but I'm not giving anything away.
[00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:40.100]   No, I think the value of having followers is clear.
[00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:42.500]   I mean, you got to be careful.
[00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:45.380]   You can't spam these people or they're all going to go away.
[00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:46.940]   You can spam them once.
[00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:47.940]   Right.
[00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:50.380]   So you got to save your wad.
[00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:52.220]   I'm not sure people are going to go away.
[00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:56.620]   I mean, how easy is it to turn off the TV so it's not very?
[00:28:56.620 --> 00:28:58.460]   Is this the next TV?
[00:28:58.460 --> 00:28:59.900]   Of course.
[00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:00.900]   Of course.
[00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:01.900]   More so.
[00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:03.860]   The little tiny URL links.
[00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:04.860]   Yeah.
[00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:05.860]   More so.
[00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:06.860]   I start executing code.
[00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:07.860]   Oh boy.
[00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:10.300]   Then we know what it's really about.
[00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:11.300]   Oh boy.
[00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:12.300]   Oh boy.
[00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:13.740]   Now I'm scared.
[00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:14.740]   What about Facebook?
[00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:17.900]   Facebook is Twitter?
[00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:18.900]   This would be interesting.
[00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:21.820]   I mean, everybody's been saying, well, what could beat Facebook?
[00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:24.500]   Something as simple and stupid and dumb as Twitter?
[00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:26.740]   A Facebook killer?
[00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:28.300]   I think they're for different things.
[00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:29.300]   Are they?
[00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:30.300]   I think.
[00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:31.300]   Do you use them both?
[00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:32.300]   I do.
[00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:38.100]   I think Facebook is still mostly for networking for most people.
[00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:39.100]   And I don't think that's going to change.
[00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:40.500]   So how do you use Facebook?
[00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:41.500]   I'm just curious.
[00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:44.860]   Do you stay in touch with your friends that way?
[00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:50.340]   Actually, most of my friends are my friends that I've known from college and from real
[00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:53.140]   life, I guess you could say, are still my space.
[00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:54.140]   Exactly.
[00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:57.260]   They're all still on my space, which I don't use.
[00:29:57.260 --> 00:30:00.420]   I just keep it on there in case they want to get in touch with me.
[00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:04.100]   Facebook is more of a just kind of landing page for me at this point.
[00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:08.940]   I mean, I've got links to all my different projects there, updates.
[00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:09.940]   It's mostly that case.
[00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:10.940]   It's mostly that case.
[00:30:10.940 --> 00:30:11.940]   It's mostly that.
[00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:12.940]   Oh, sorry.
[00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:15.780]   I just opened my Facebook page and there was stick them on it.
[00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:16.780]   I apologize.
[00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:18.780]   I started feeding myself to myself.
[00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:19.780]   It was funny.
[00:30:19.780 --> 00:30:20.780]   I was amusing.
[00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:21.780]   A snake eating its own tail.
[00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:23.380]   It was opened a wormhole.
[00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:24.380]   Yeah.
[00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:26.380]   Cross the beams.
[00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:27.980]   Did you see that AOL bought Bebo?
[00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:29.620]   Bebo, of course, is the big.
[00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:34.380]   In fact, I had never heard of Bebo until I saw that last year on Google Zeitgeist, it was
[00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:36.380]   the number one search term.
[00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:38.980]   I thought, what is Beboo?
[00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:43.900]   Bebo is basically on my space or Facebook more popular, I think, in Europe.
[00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:44.900]   Yes.
[00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:45.900]   I don't know where it's.
[00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:46.900]   Yeah, it's more.
[00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:47.900]   I thought it was a content.
[00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:49.900]   I thought it was a user content site.
[00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:50.900]   It is.
[00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:53.580]   It's a Myspace user content site.
[00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:59.780]   No, I mean, like a lot of videos and, you know, kind of a YouTube thing with social networking
[00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:00.780]   attached.
[00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:02.460]   One of those.
[00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:03.460]   I don't know.
[00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:04.460]   I guess we don't know what it is.
[00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:05.460]   How's it all sites?
[00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:07.220]   Does it make sense for AOL to be buying it?
[00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:08.220]   No, they got it.
[00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:09.780]   Apparently they have to do something.
[00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:12.780]   I brought this up to a number of people in the industry and they said, well, you know,
[00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:14.820]   those guys, they got to do something.
[00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:15.820]   It's true.
[00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:16.820]   They have to find a business model.
[00:31:16.820 --> 00:31:21.380]   Yeah, which is getting bought by Yahoo with them be bought by Microsoft.
[00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:26.340]   Microsoft Microsoft and Yahoo finally sat down for the first time since the Microsoft
[00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:30.260]   attempt to buy Yahoo.
[00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:32.100]   Is that a breakthrough?
[00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:35.300]   The meeting occurred on Monday at Yahoo's headquarters.
[00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:38.940]   This is according to Yahoo News, which I don't know.
[00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:41.820]   Although I don't think they had any insight into this.
[00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:43.300]   No investment bankers there.
[00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:49.620]   A discussion about the offer, although they must have talked about something.
[00:31:49.620 --> 00:31:57.460]   One of the reports had him talking about the Microsoft vision.
[00:31:57.460 --> 00:32:03.260]   That was the word used regarding the two companies getting together.
[00:32:03.260 --> 00:32:05.260]   They were wooing them.
[00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:06.820]   Yeah, I guess.
[00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:08.620]   I don't know the way Microsoft operates.
[00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:13.140]   I don't know how, because Gates already said he's not going to pay any more money.
[00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:17.460]   Then there was one report that came out saying that they may actually lower the offer.
[00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:19.780]   Just to screw with them.
[00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:22.220]   That's a good way to put the screws to them, isn't it?
[00:32:22.220 --> 00:32:23.220]   Okay.
[00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:28.180]   Every week that goes by will pay you $100 million less.
[00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:29.180]   That's a good idea.
[00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:32.060]   We'll put it into Twitter infrastructure.
[00:32:32.060 --> 00:32:35.860]   Steve, do you have a Twitter problem?
[00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:36.860]   Yeah, I do.
[00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:38.220]   I think you're an addict.
[00:32:38.220 --> 00:32:43.100]   I've been addicted since the first day that I used it, I had no idea what it was good
[00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:47.940]   for and no hope of ever having anything that it would be good for.
[00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:49.740]   I hear a song here.
[00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:50.740]   Yeah, it's Twitter.
[00:32:50.740 --> 00:32:52.500]   What is it good for?
[00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:56.820]   I seriously think that it is completely dominant.
[00:32:56.820 --> 00:33:02.940]   Your question to Veronica before, I think Facebook and Twitter are accelerants of each
[00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:03.940]   other.
[00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:06.940]   Neither is going to go away.
[00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:10.620]   I mean, actually a lot of people when they Twitter updates their Facebook status, so
[00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:13.740]   I guess there is some integration that way.
[00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:15.500]   What happens to poor old pounce?
[00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:19.220]   Is pounce an also ran or a never was?
[00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:21.660]   I use pounce differently than I use Twitter.
[00:33:21.660 --> 00:33:26.740]   They can live side by side harmoniously in my world, but a lot of people don't see it
[00:33:26.740 --> 00:33:27.740]   that way.
[00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:33.980]   John, you were implying that Microsoft has no vision.
[00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:38.060]   No, I would like to actually hear that conversation.
[00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:39.060]   What is our vision?
[00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:40.060]   What is the vision?
[00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:42.380]   Apparently, they have some concept.
[00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:45.380]   I guess they were throwing at them and they said, "Come on, you guys should do this with
[00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:46.380]   us."
[00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:47.380]   I don't know.
[00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:48.380]   I have no idea.
[00:33:48.380 --> 00:33:51.380]   Those meetings are always, they're sales meetings.
[00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:52.380]   They're sales meetings.
[00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:54.780]   You guys are good salesmen and there you can do it, but I don't know that anything.
[00:33:54.780 --> 00:33:58.860]   Sometimes I feel like Microsoft is just kind of an amorphous blob that's going feed me
[00:33:58.860 --> 00:34:02.860]   and trying to absorb as many different things in different areas as I possibly can.
[00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:03.860]   Kind of like Google?
[00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:04.860]   Yes, they're being assimilated.
[00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:09.940]   I feel like it's these two, well, it kind of goes without saying, but Google and Microsoft
[00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:14.260]   just trying to reach out and grab, take as much land grab as they can before everything's
[00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:15.540]   all sucked up.
[00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:16.620]   I think Patrick could do this.
[00:34:16.620 --> 00:34:18.820]   Patrick, you're a Microsoft VP.
[00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:25.020]   You've been sent to Sunnyvale to talk to Yahoo folks to convince them that Microsoft is
[00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:29.540]   the next big thing and that this acquisition is going to be great for you.
[00:34:29.540 --> 00:34:30.540]   What would you tell them?
[00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:33.500]   Guys, here's the way it is.
[00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:38.100]   You're all going to get crust like a narke at a biker rally or you can join Microsoft and
[00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:42.180]   try to rally against Google, which is what I'll be, you all love the whole idea of retiring
[00:34:42.180 --> 00:34:43.180]   before you're 70, right?
[00:34:43.180 --> 00:34:48.340]   Do you want to wake up one day and find out that your vacuum in the hallway in a casino
[00:34:48.340 --> 00:34:49.420]   and Reno?
[00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:52.420]   Not that I don't enjoy the idea of vacuum in a hallway, casino and Reno, but yeah,
[00:34:52.420 --> 00:34:53.420]   what do you mean?
[00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:55.300]   Like, I can see the conversation in a lot like that.
[00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:59.940]   Really that negative, like, come on, you have no future, no hope, we're the only chance.
[00:34:59.940 --> 00:35:04.900]   The other way of doing it is doing the whole, like, you know, you guys have this search
[00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:09.780]   thing, which isn't as successful as we'd like and you've got this whole online video thing
[00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:13.700]   and ours hasn't been as successful as we've like and you all bought Flickr before we were
[00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:17.740]   smart enough to realize we could have bought Flickr and it would be a long, laundry list
[00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:24.020]   of, you know, merging their synergies because basically, you know, Yahoo for all its complicated
[00:35:24.020 --> 00:35:29.580]   managerial issues still seems to be a lot better than Microsoft at building community
[00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:30.580]   sites.
[00:35:30.580 --> 00:35:31.580]   That's true.
[00:35:31.580 --> 00:35:33.180]   And then they haven't stopped either.
[00:35:33.180 --> 00:35:34.180]   They keep cranking out.
[00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:36.340]   Sue to buy for sure.
[00:35:36.340 --> 00:35:37.860]   Say again, Veronica, I'm sorry.
[00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:39.380]   They pick good sites to buy.
[00:35:39.380 --> 00:35:42.620]   I mean, compared to Google, who has bought a lot of different sites that haven't gone
[00:35:42.620 --> 00:35:46.540]   anywhere, for example, Dodgeball, which is basically just sitting on one server and some
[00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:51.260]   guys closet and is checked on every three weeks, sites like upcoming and Flickr are
[00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:53.740]   continuing to grow and do very well.
[00:35:53.740 --> 00:35:54.820]   That's a good point.
[00:35:54.820 --> 00:35:55.820]   That's a good point.
[00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:59.780]   They may be losing the money, but they're, but they, as in terms of the audience, they're
[00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:01.340]   still maintaining the community.
[00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:03.180]   Yeah, the community's there.
[00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:05.780]   Well, it's not a small thing to do.
[00:36:05.780 --> 00:36:09.420]   If I'm going in there, I'm saying, Hey, guys, Google just acquired double click.
[00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:11.220]   It just went through.
[00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:14.500]   We better get together now.
[00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:15.500]   What about this?
[00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:22.140]   To get the double click merger with Google approved by the EU at $3.1 billion deal went
[00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:23.140]   through.
[00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:26.780]   Does Google now become the evil empire?
[00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:28.180]   Just now become the evil empire.
[00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:29.820]   I like Google.
[00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:31.700]   I don't want to believe ill of them.
[00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:35.140]   Hey, you can like them and they can still be evil.
[00:36:35.140 --> 00:36:37.580]   Should we worry about them?
[00:36:37.580 --> 00:36:39.220]   Should we worry about them?
[00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:40.500]   We need them to be evil.
[00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:45.820]   We need them to be evil so that the Microsoft is the good guy and they can catch up.
[00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:48.540]   Do we want Microsoft to be the good guys?
[00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:49.540]   Absolutely.
[00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:51.300]   Are you saying that because we need competition?
[00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:53.500]   No, because silver light's going to win.
[00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:55.060]   It's going to dominate everything.
[00:36:55.060 --> 00:36:56.140]   He's got the, he went, you know what?
[00:36:56.140 --> 00:37:01.140]   He went to mix OA and they had this punch and he drank some of it.
[00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:05.420]   Silver light did have an excellent guitar hero free booth at South by also.
[00:37:05.420 --> 00:37:06.420]   Really?
[00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:08.180]   I have to say that made me feel better about it.
[00:37:08.180 --> 00:37:12.060]   Now were the developers gathered around seeing how they can implement Silver light on their
[00:37:12.060 --> 00:37:13.060]   websites?
[00:37:13.060 --> 00:37:15.060]   I don't know.
[00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:16.060]   No.
[00:37:16.060 --> 00:37:17.060]   No.
[00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:20.340]   Well, they weren't gathered around implementing Flash either.
[00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:23.820]   Well, y'all you need is a YouTube and a Google video and I don't think you need to go
[00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:24.820]   any farther.
[00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:26.500]   I mean, Flash is there, right?
[00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:30.420]   How about air versus, I mean, they're already, if they know Flash, they like Flash.
[00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:31.420]   Why not just do air?
[00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:32.420]   Why do silver light?
[00:37:32.420 --> 00:37:34.940]   Because there's money in it.
[00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:35.940]   Is there how?
[00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:38.980]   Well, Microsoft has got a lot of money to spend.
[00:37:38.980 --> 00:37:41.380]   So Microsoft is going to pay them to do it.
[00:37:41.380 --> 00:37:45.260]   Well, they've all traditionally spent a lot of money on developers.
[00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:49.860]   So that short term, make the money for Microsoft for a product nobody will use and retire before
[00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:53.980]   you have to take what's left of the earnings from the Microsoft payoff to develop with their
[00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:55.940]   tools to develop your 3.0 product.
[00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:59.300]   Because nobody downloaded your 2.0 product so you can figure out that silver light wasn't
[00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:00.300]   a virus.
[00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:03.500]   Oh, that's a good way of putting it.
[00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:05.420]   I'm not, I have to say, I'm not convinced.
[00:38:05.420 --> 00:38:10.260]   I think people, you know, people have been, people don't like Microsoft technologies, especially
[00:38:10.260 --> 00:38:12.260]   web developers.
[00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:16.740]   These, do you really think web developers want to get in Microsoft's pocket?
[00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:19.860]   Do you know these visual basic developers?
[00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:24.660]   Well, I know there's, I know these could, I know there are a lot of corporate developers.
[00:38:24.660 --> 00:38:29.140]   I know there are a lot of corporate developers and intranet developers who use .NET and they
[00:38:29.140 --> 00:38:31.100]   very much want to make a .NET site.
[00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:35.180]   I'm sure Silverlight will be all over the intra web.
[00:38:35.180 --> 00:38:37.100]   But what about the internet?
[00:38:37.100 --> 00:38:42.020]   I mean, I just have a feeling that at least the South by Southwest types are not going
[00:38:42.020 --> 00:38:44.020]   to be jumping all over Silverlight.
[00:38:44.020 --> 00:38:46.580]   Well, that would have been an interesting thing to do is to sit by that booth and just
[00:38:46.580 --> 00:38:48.100]   see what kind of reaction they were getting.
[00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:49.340]   Besides the rock band.
[00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:55.140]   Well, I know you guys don't believe this, but then did you think Twitter was going to
[00:38:55.140 --> 00:38:57.060]   be as huge as it is now?
[00:38:57.060 --> 00:38:59.460]   I joined Twitter in October 2006.
[00:38:59.460 --> 00:39:04.260]   How, does anybody know how many members Twitter actually has?
[00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:05.740]   I don't.
[00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:06.740]   Anybody?
[00:39:06.740 --> 00:39:07.740]   Anybody?
[00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:08.740]   Mueller?
[00:39:08.740 --> 00:39:13.300]   Yeah, actually, I think CommScore says a million.
[00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:14.300]   I'm trying.
[00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:16.340]   I'll see if I can find it.
[00:39:16.340 --> 00:39:17.740]   Let's track them down.
[00:39:17.740 --> 00:39:18.740]   Yeah.
[00:39:18.740 --> 00:39:24.940]   I've seen numbers, but you know, of course, all of these are external numbers, not Twitter's
[00:39:24.940 --> 00:39:25.940]   numbers.
[00:39:25.940 --> 00:39:35.140]   Twitter's not saying that according to a CommScore media metrics in, let's see.
[00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:41.140]   370,000 unique visitors in June, according to media metrics.
[00:39:41.140 --> 00:39:42.140]   But that was June.
[00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:45.500]   I'm sure it's twice that now.
[00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:46.500]   That's pretty low.
[00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:49.500]   If actually that's the unique, that's pretty low.
[00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:52.540]   Then how come everybody's talking about it so much?
[00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:53.780]   It's us though.
[00:39:53.780 --> 00:39:55.540]   It's very inside, isn't it?
[00:39:55.540 --> 00:40:01.940]   Well, you know, when Zuckerberg and Sarah Lacey, you know, happened, I think it pretty
[00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:03.740]   much took over TechMean.
[00:40:03.740 --> 00:40:04.740]   Yeah.
[00:40:04.740 --> 00:40:08.820]   But still, that's the technology news sector.
[00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:10.940]   That's not outside of that too much.
[00:40:10.940 --> 00:40:11.940]   Fair enough.
[00:40:11.940 --> 00:40:13.580]   So what else is going on?
[00:40:13.580 --> 00:40:15.820]   There's the Obama Clinton campaign.
[00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:16.820]   That's kind of interesting.
[00:40:16.820 --> 00:40:21.060]   I mean, I think that I don't know if people have covered this as much as they ought to,
[00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:25.060]   but I have to have a feeling that Obama's secret sauce may end up being a very adept
[00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:27.260]   use of social networks, certainly for fundraising.
[00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:28.860]   There's something to think about.
[00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:29.860]   Here's something to think about.
[00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:32.420]   Obama follows back all his followers.
[00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:33.220]   Hillary does not.
[00:40:33.220 --> 00:40:34.220]   Yeah.
[00:40:34.220 --> 00:40:35.740]   What does that say about their campaign?
[00:40:35.740 --> 00:40:37.740]   And look how many followers Obama has.
[00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:40.140]   It means that they have a lot of follow on.
[00:40:40.140 --> 00:40:41.140]   I know.
[00:40:41.140 --> 00:40:42.140]   I'm just saying.
[00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:46.780]   But Hillary's campaign couldn't figure it out, right?
[00:40:46.780 --> 00:40:47.780]   It's a simple thing.
[00:40:47.780 --> 00:40:50.380]   They could have done that and they didn't figure that out.
[00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:52.900]   It just means they don't get it.
[00:40:52.900 --> 00:40:56.980]   The one person on their team who's in charge of managing their social network, the one
[00:40:56.980 --> 00:40:58.620]   group around, doesn't get it.
[00:40:58.620 --> 00:40:59.620]   The one guy.
[00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:01.620]   Assuming there is one.
[00:41:01.620 --> 00:41:05.100]   John Edwards was on Twitter before either of them were, and I certainly followed him.
[00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:08.380]   Initially, John seemed like he was actually using it.
[00:41:08.380 --> 00:41:13.060]   In fact, he had the good grace to when a staffer was posting, it would say staff.
[00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:17.140]   And then I presume when it didn't, it was in first John, John Edwards first person, he
[00:41:17.140 --> 00:41:20.020]   was actually doing it.
[00:41:20.020 --> 00:41:24.300]   I don't know if when you see a Barack Obama post, it's clearly a staff member, right?
[00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:28.700]   I mean, I don't think Barack's whipping out his blackberry and saying, I better tell Twitter
[00:41:28.700 --> 00:41:29.860]   what's going on now.
[00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:36.900]   Well, if you look at what Obama's done in terms of winning states, he's won in caucus
[00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:43.860]   states, which is caucuses are a perfect proving ground for a Twitter or social media type
[00:41:43.860 --> 00:41:44.860]   of environment.
[00:41:44.860 --> 00:41:45.860]   Right.
[00:41:45.860 --> 00:41:47.620]   No, I agree.
[00:41:47.620 --> 00:41:53.340]   I would say that Obama's secret sauce, much more so than say how our dean four years ago,
[00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:58.100]   was a real ability not just to use blogs and the internet, but to use things like Twitter.
[00:41:58.100 --> 00:42:02.100]   I mean, if you look at the Obama groups on Facebook, they're very active.
[00:42:02.100 --> 00:42:03.940]   Hey, but did it help Ron Paul?
[00:42:03.940 --> 00:42:04.940]   No.
[00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:08.380]   He was the darling of the internet on dig and on Reddit and everywhere else.
[00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:09.380]   And where did that go?
[00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:13.740]   Well, it didn't help Howard Dean either, but it helped John Kerry.
[00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:19.540]   He picked up all of that stuff and used what's going on in the Dean campaign in a couple
[00:42:19.540 --> 00:42:20.740]   months later.
[00:42:20.740 --> 00:42:26.580]   And then the Republicans picked up on it and beat Kerry with social media.
[00:42:26.580 --> 00:42:30.460]   So you can't polish it, Terry, but you can promote the hell out of it on social networks.
[00:42:30.460 --> 00:42:31.460]   There you go.
[00:42:31.460 --> 00:42:32.460]   Bingo.
[00:42:32.460 --> 00:42:34.460]   That's exactly it.
[00:42:34.460 --> 00:42:38.500]   Ultimately, you're not going to win votes for somebody who's not, you know, electable.
[00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:39.500]   What are you?
[00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:41.940]   What's ripping shreds of paper over there?
[00:42:41.940 --> 00:42:45.180]   Do you beaving a basket out of paper?
[00:42:45.180 --> 00:42:48.060]   Now what are you doing?
[00:42:48.060 --> 00:42:49.060]   That's not me.
[00:42:49.060 --> 00:42:50.220]   I wasn't making the ripping.
[00:42:50.220 --> 00:42:51.620]   I think it's Patrick actually.
[00:42:51.620 --> 00:42:53.540]   Are you opening mail?
[00:42:53.540 --> 00:42:58.220]   Uh, no, I'm down in the garage and was pulling an article out of a magazine.
[00:42:58.220 --> 00:42:59.220]   I'm terribly sorry.
[00:42:59.220 --> 00:43:00.220]   No, it's great.
[00:43:00.220 --> 00:43:01.220]   I love it.
[00:43:01.220 --> 00:43:02.220]   I do this.
[00:43:02.220 --> 00:43:09.140]   Hey, speaking of, uh, speaking of numbers and love, yeah, it hasn't been above, uh, she
[00:43:09.140 --> 00:43:17.020]   hasn't been above like 15 and change, like 1560 something since 2000 and 2000.
[00:43:17.020 --> 00:43:18.020]   But you.
[00:43:18.020 --> 00:43:19.020]   I'm not so glad.
[00:43:19.020 --> 00:43:20.220]   Yeah, no, I, I, that's right.
[00:43:20.220 --> 00:43:21.220]   Okay.
[00:43:21.220 --> 00:43:23.660]   I'm sorry, but they were up in some ridiculous sky.
[00:43:23.660 --> 00:43:27.220]   But then the crash took place, but at least it was level at 15.
[00:43:27.220 --> 00:43:29.220]   It was actually hanging in there at 15 or so.
[00:43:29.220 --> 00:43:31.500]   And then all of a sudden it took this big drop.
[00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:33.260]   It's down the middle of nowhere.
[00:43:33.260 --> 00:43:35.540]   Six or seven.
[00:43:35.540 --> 00:43:43.980]   And they took all of 2005 to get up to 14, 15 bucks and then spent a few months in 2006
[00:43:43.980 --> 00:43:44.980]   and drop down.
[00:43:44.980 --> 00:43:46.980]   Well, what happened?
[00:43:46.980 --> 00:43:47.980]   I don't know.
[00:43:47.980 --> 00:43:53.620]   I think Leo yawned and the whole network went down.
[00:43:53.620 --> 00:43:57.500]   Now you only know that because you were watching the video.
[00:43:57.500 --> 00:44:01.060]   I have to remember the video.
[00:44:01.060 --> 00:44:03.220]   This video.
[00:44:03.220 --> 00:44:04.420]   This was not a great news week.
[00:44:04.420 --> 00:44:06.340]   I have to confess.
[00:44:06.340 --> 00:44:09.420]   I didn't see any stories that really caught my eye.
[00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:13.220]   Anybody have anything that you noticed that you picked up on that you thought was a big
[00:44:13.220 --> 00:44:14.220]   deal?
[00:44:14.220 --> 00:44:15.220]   Big deal.
[00:44:15.220 --> 00:44:17.220]   No, I still think so.
[00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:22.140]   I just get a Twitter that it was Leo with the paper according to Twitter user, cafe
[00:44:22.140 --> 00:44:23.140]   ninja.
[00:44:23.140 --> 00:44:24.620]   Hey, hey, knock that off.
[00:44:24.620 --> 00:44:26.140]   So are you doing it?
[00:44:26.140 --> 00:44:27.140]   Knock that off.
[00:44:27.140 --> 00:44:29.660]   The video I'm busted once again.
[00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:36.100]   Everybody read the article with Stephen Levy accidentally throwing a smack at the air with
[00:44:36.100 --> 00:44:37.100]   the recycling.
[00:44:37.100 --> 00:44:38.740]   I thought that was awesome.
[00:44:38.740 --> 00:44:40.980]   He has opened up to that in an article.
[00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:42.700]   Well, he's I don't know if he was sure of it.
[00:44:42.700 --> 00:44:46.420]   I think he that was his theory about what I think got stolen.
[00:44:46.420 --> 00:44:49.140]   No, he doesn't talk about theory.
[00:44:49.140 --> 00:44:50.140]   Give me a break.
[00:44:50.140 --> 00:44:51.140]   It's a great theory.
[00:44:51.140 --> 00:44:52.140]   Have you had an area?
[00:44:52.140 --> 00:44:55.980]   It would be so easy to this is what he says happened is he left it on the on the coffee
[00:44:55.980 --> 00:44:56.980]   table with a Sunday time.
[00:44:56.980 --> 00:44:58.580]   This is what he thinks happened.
[00:44:58.580 --> 00:45:02.460]   And he doesn't know why scooped it into the time is thin enough.
[00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:03.460]   He's playing it.
[00:45:03.460 --> 00:45:04.460]   He's playing it.
[00:45:04.460 --> 00:45:05.460]   Yeah, he's playing it.
[00:45:05.460 --> 00:45:08.860]   Listen, I've got an air and there's a whole thing going on with this thing.
[00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:14.860]   The first minute that I opened it, I said to my wife, this is just who gives about this.
[00:45:14.860 --> 00:45:15.860]   Oh, sorry.
[00:45:15.860 --> 00:45:20.740]   You know, it just didn't seem to have any real value.
[00:45:20.740 --> 00:45:23.660]   Now I carry it around with me when I go to the bathroom.
[00:45:23.660 --> 00:45:25.220]   I carry it out to the car.
[00:45:25.220 --> 00:45:27.660]   I just I can't get rid of the thing.
[00:45:27.660 --> 00:45:30.460]   So in fact, you're I'm sorry.
[00:45:30.460 --> 00:45:34.540]   Now, we're just going to have to bloop this out.
[00:45:34.540 --> 00:45:38.060]   So not only do you give it about it, but you take it with it.
[00:45:38.060 --> 00:45:41.620]   Okay, let me just make a mark there.
[00:45:41.620 --> 00:45:43.620]   Where's the zipper?
[00:45:43.620 --> 00:45:45.620]   I'm sorry.
[00:45:45.620 --> 00:45:53.140]   No, but this machine, I mean, how many people on this call have actually used the air?
[00:45:53.140 --> 00:45:55.140]   I have one.
[00:45:55.140 --> 00:45:58.380]   I typed on one.
[00:45:58.380 --> 00:46:00.820]   Yeah, by the way, it's going back to Apple on Monday.
[00:46:00.820 --> 00:46:02.780]   It's heavy and you keep saying that, Leo.
[00:46:02.780 --> 00:46:04.860]   It's heavy enough that it's not going to be picked up.
[00:46:04.860 --> 00:46:07.660]   Usually when you pick up something, you got like a laptop stuff.
[00:46:07.660 --> 00:46:13.020]   You notice the three pounds that it weighs, it would have seen a slide out or you'd say
[00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:15.060]   she's just something else is in here.
[00:46:15.060 --> 00:46:18.980]   I think a stack of newspapers, stack of newspapers heavy enough that it would blend in.
[00:46:18.980 --> 00:46:21.260]   I mean, do you read newspapers anymore, John?
[00:46:21.260 --> 00:46:23.060]   Do you remember the half of the newspaper?
[00:46:23.060 --> 00:46:24.060]   It's a lot of times.
[00:46:24.060 --> 00:46:26.660]   But it's three pounds is a lot and it's fact that it's in there.
[00:46:26.660 --> 00:46:28.500]   What's it doing in there in the first place?
[00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:31.420]   Why would you slip it into a stack of newspapers in the first place?
[00:46:31.420 --> 00:46:32.980]   You don't slip it in.
[00:46:32.980 --> 00:46:34.740]   You're less than on top, somebody's not paying attention.
[00:46:34.740 --> 00:46:38.100]   Haven't you ever read a newspaper or somebody else in a coffee table and stuff?
[00:46:38.100 --> 00:46:41.460]   It's a Sunday paper for all those circulars and calendar.
[00:46:41.460 --> 00:46:45.300]   I would like somebody to try to test this in YouTube to results.
[00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:46.900]   I just don't think it's that easy.
[00:46:46.900 --> 00:46:49.780]   And the other thing is where's the flexibility when you pick up the stack of newspapers,
[00:46:49.780 --> 00:46:53.020]   there's always going to be some flexing in there where you got a hard item like this.
[00:46:53.020 --> 00:46:55.820]   Laptop is not going to flex so much, you're going to notice it.
[00:46:55.820 --> 00:46:56.820]   We're getting so far.
[00:46:56.820 --> 00:46:59.260]   I'm inclined to agree with John on this one.
[00:46:59.260 --> 00:47:04.060]   I think that Stephen Levy just kind of did it as an attention grabber, frankly.
[00:47:04.060 --> 00:47:06.060]   All right, we're getting him on Twitter next week.
[00:47:06.060 --> 00:47:07.620]   We're going to get him on Twitter next week.
[00:47:07.620 --> 00:47:08.620]   I think he got news week.
[00:47:08.620 --> 00:47:09.620]   I didn't.
[00:47:09.620 --> 00:47:10.460]   He gave it to his wife.
[00:47:10.460 --> 00:47:12.460]   He did, in fact, get news week to pay for it.
[00:47:12.460 --> 00:47:18.420]   So some news week, news week isn't enough exposure for Stephen Levy.
[00:47:18.420 --> 00:47:19.900]   He had to invent throwing out.
[00:47:19.900 --> 00:47:21.540]   Couldn't he have done something cooler?
[00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:25.020]   I mean, something less, you know, mortally embarrassing.
[00:47:25.020 --> 00:47:29.460]   Or is it some sort of geek cache to be like, I threw up my airbook and I got my job to
[00:47:29.460 --> 00:47:30.460]   buy a new one?
[00:47:30.460 --> 00:47:31.460]   I know.
[00:47:31.460 --> 00:47:34.060]   I think it's actually fairly reasonable.
[00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:37.900]   The thing is light enough and kind of airy enough that I think it's not so unreasonable.
[00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:41.940]   And what it is, it's telling anecdote about the fact that the air really is.
[00:47:41.940 --> 00:47:42.940]   Oh, it's a crock.
[00:47:42.940 --> 00:47:45.220]   It's a typical, but it sounds like a bunch of promotion.
[00:47:45.220 --> 00:47:48.700]   The other thing is he was at some radio station or whatever and he can't quite remember if
[00:47:48.700 --> 00:47:50.580]   he picked up the air or not.
[00:47:50.580 --> 00:47:54.180]   And it was like, you know, if you read the whole story and he's like, yeah, I can't imagine
[00:47:54.180 --> 00:47:55.180]   what happened.
[00:47:55.180 --> 00:48:00.060]   Well, he's trying to dream and they said, well, don't worry if it ever has to be repaired.
[00:48:00.060 --> 00:48:03.620]   We'll have the guy's serial number because he went through that process with the company
[00:48:03.620 --> 00:48:05.260]   thinking it might have been stolen.
[00:48:05.260 --> 00:48:07.420]   And you know, she could have left it anywhere.
[00:48:07.420 --> 00:48:08.420]   It could be in the car.
[00:48:08.420 --> 00:48:11.380]   Sounds like you analyze this story very deeply.
[00:48:11.380 --> 00:48:12.620]   I didn't analyze it.
[00:48:12.620 --> 00:48:17.620]   Well, I read it when I was just kind of going, this is a crock, a crapped story because I remember
[00:48:17.620 --> 00:48:22.300]   reading somebody going on and on about what a hilarious story it was.
[00:48:22.300 --> 00:48:25.700]   And I said, well, let me go see how Steve, I know Steve personally, I don't think he's
[00:48:25.700 --> 00:48:26.700]   that funny.
[00:48:26.700 --> 00:48:29.620]   Although to be honest about when he does it, he has a stand up he can do.
[00:48:29.620 --> 00:48:30.620]   He's hilarious.
[00:48:30.620 --> 00:48:31.620]   Really?
[00:48:31.620 --> 00:48:33.700]   And when he's in his right, yeah, he's killing it, it's unbelievable.
[00:48:33.700 --> 00:48:36.540]   But his writing is not known for its humor.
[00:48:36.540 --> 00:48:37.540]   And so I'm saying, well, that's interesting.
[00:48:37.540 --> 00:48:38.540]   It's changing.
[00:48:38.540 --> 00:48:42.300]   I read there's nothing in there that I thought was funny except the idea that he might have
[00:48:42.300 --> 00:48:46.780]   had crushed in the trash compactor.
[00:48:46.780 --> 00:48:49.860]   But you know, what are you doing to put newspapers in the trash compactor?
[00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:51.460]   I think that was mentioned to that doesn't make sense.
[00:48:51.460 --> 00:48:53.180]   He's supposed to recycle those.
[00:48:53.180 --> 00:48:54.180]   Yeah.
[00:48:54.180 --> 00:48:58.740]   Actually, a lot of urban areas, they do the recycling at the basically they haul everything
[00:48:58.740 --> 00:49:01.580]   and it gets sorted in a big warehouse and sold out of the warehouse.
[00:49:01.580 --> 00:49:02.580]   I bet.
[00:49:02.580 --> 00:49:05.100]   They do that a lot in San Francisco, actually.
[00:49:05.100 --> 00:49:06.100]   Yeah.
[00:49:06.100 --> 00:49:10.820]   So I want to take a break for a moment and mention audible.com, the sponsor of this program.
[00:49:10.820 --> 00:49:13.700]   And I'm sure they're very glad to be here right about now.
[00:49:13.700 --> 00:49:15.140]   Audible.com/twit.

[00:49:36.660 --> 00:49:37.660]   Take it with you.
[00:49:37.660 --> 00:49:39.620]   I listened to a lot of books on audible.com.
[00:49:39.620 --> 00:49:46.300]   I thought for, for the group today that Warren Buffett speaks the wit and wisdom from the
[00:49:46.300 --> 00:49:50.460]   world's greatest investor might be a good choice.
[00:49:50.460 --> 00:49:51.460]   From the world.
[00:49:51.460 --> 00:49:52.460]   I am.
[00:49:52.460 --> 00:49:53.460]   Yeah.
[00:49:53.460 --> 00:49:54.460]   He is now the world's richest man.
[00:49:54.460 --> 00:49:56.260]   He's number, number one.
[00:49:56.260 --> 00:49:57.260]   All right.
[00:49:57.260 --> 00:49:58.540]   Let me read you.
[00:49:58.540 --> 00:50:04.300]   Here's some quotes with enough insider information and a million dollars you can go broken a
[00:50:04.300 --> 00:50:06.700]   year.
[00:50:06.700 --> 00:50:08.180]   Or here's another one.
[00:50:08.180 --> 00:50:09.620]   What I am is your realist.
[00:50:09.620 --> 00:50:10.980]   I always knew what I'd like.
[00:50:10.980 --> 00:50:13.220]   I always knew I'd like what I'm doing.
[00:50:13.220 --> 00:50:16.860]   Or perhaps it would have been nice to be a major league baseball player.
[00:50:16.860 --> 00:50:19.260]   But that's where the, I'm not, I'm not.
[00:50:19.260 --> 00:50:20.420]   I'm not distant Warren Buffett.
[00:50:20.420 --> 00:50:22.340]   The dude came up with his concept.
[00:50:22.340 --> 00:50:23.340]   He's held to it.
[00:50:23.340 --> 00:50:26.300]   He's done a lot of people who invested with him really wealthy.
[00:50:26.300 --> 00:50:27.300]   Done well.
[00:50:27.300 --> 00:50:28.300]   I had some Berkshire Hathaway.
[00:50:28.300 --> 00:50:30.620]   I'd be happy.
[00:50:30.620 --> 00:50:32.620]   And you know, he's also, he's like Bill Gates.
[00:50:32.620 --> 00:50:34.900]   He's going to give away all his money.
[00:50:34.900 --> 00:50:35.900]   Well, all the people.
[00:50:35.900 --> 00:50:36.900]   Yeah, he's going to have Bill Gates management.
[00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:37.900]   That's what management.
[00:50:37.900 --> 00:50:38.900]   Big joke.
[00:50:38.900 --> 00:50:39.900]   He's giving it to Bill.
[00:50:39.900 --> 00:50:41.900]   What makes that a joke?
[00:50:41.900 --> 00:50:42.900]   Here's the joke.
[00:50:42.900 --> 00:50:44.500]   And I won't say who told me this.
[00:50:44.500 --> 00:50:49.060]   Venture Calibis says, why don't you bring up the fact that how does Warren Buffett manage
[00:50:49.060 --> 00:50:54.140]   to get Bill Gates to quit his company to manage Warren Buffett's money?
[00:50:54.140 --> 00:50:55.900]   Now Bill's not the number one guy anymore.
[00:50:55.900 --> 00:50:58.900]   He's actually dropped the number three in this world's richest man.
[00:50:58.900 --> 00:51:02.900]   And meanwhile, Bill's like managing Warren's money because Warren has got other things
[00:51:02.900 --> 00:51:04.500]   to do like run a business.
[00:51:04.500 --> 00:51:06.500]   I mean, if that's not funny, I don't know what is.
[00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:08.660]   That's a good point to sign up Warren Buffett's brilliance.
[00:51:08.660 --> 00:51:09.660]   He's brilliant.
[00:51:09.660 --> 00:51:10.660]   He's brilliant.
[00:51:10.660 --> 00:51:11.660]   Some off John Hill.
[00:51:11.660 --> 00:51:12.660]   Totally.
[00:51:12.660 --> 00:51:13.660]   I agree with that.
[00:51:13.660 --> 00:51:14.660]   That's the point.
[00:51:14.660 --> 00:51:15.660]   It's like Warren is obviously the smarter of the two guys.
[00:51:15.660 --> 00:51:17.860]   You see, that's why this is a good book.
[00:51:17.860 --> 00:51:18.860]   Bill's working for Warren.
[00:51:18.860 --> 00:51:24.140]   Well, Street is the only place that people ride to work in a Rolls Royce to get advice
[00:51:24.140 --> 00:51:25.740]   from those who take the subway.
[00:51:25.740 --> 00:51:29.860]   I don't know what that means.
[00:51:29.860 --> 00:51:31.060]   It's just in the book.
[00:51:31.060 --> 00:51:34.420]   Warren Buffett speaks the wit and wisdom of the world's greatest investor and now the
[00:51:34.420 --> 00:51:35.420]   world's richest man.
[00:51:35.420 --> 00:51:38.300]   It could be yours absolutely free.
[00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:40.100]   Now, how do you like that?
[00:51:40.100 --> 00:51:42.260]   I thought Gabby Hayes was dead.
[00:51:42.260 --> 00:51:46.100]   Hey, Gabby Hayes, he's going to automobiles at Cam Swish.
[00:51:46.100 --> 00:51:47.100]   Twit.
[00:51:47.100 --> 00:51:48.300]   You get your own copy that there.
[00:51:48.300 --> 00:51:51.060]   We got beans for supper, everybody.
[00:51:51.060 --> 00:51:53.300]   Read a couple more quotes in that Gabby Hayes voice.
[00:51:53.300 --> 00:51:55.060]   I don't have any.
[00:51:55.060 --> 00:51:56.060]   Why?
[00:51:56.060 --> 00:51:57.860]   It's just hilarious.
[00:51:57.860 --> 00:51:59.180]   Actually run out of quotes.
[00:51:59.180 --> 00:52:00.700]   There was only four on the page.
[00:52:00.700 --> 00:52:04.140]   I got to get the book and then I can do some more for you.
[00:52:04.140 --> 00:52:12.100]   We do think of so much for their support of the Twit Netcast Network.
[00:52:12.100 --> 00:52:17.220]   They are our primary sponsor and they are renewing for another great year of Gabby Hayes
[00:52:17.220 --> 00:52:18.220]   impressions.
[00:52:18.220 --> 00:52:19.420]   It's going to be great.
[00:52:19.420 --> 00:52:20.860]   It's going to be great.
[00:52:20.860 --> 00:52:21.860]   It's art.
[00:52:21.860 --> 00:52:22.860]   You should have.
[00:52:22.860 --> 00:52:26.460]   Yeah, you should tell the audible people that you could read that whole book in a Gabby
[00:52:26.460 --> 00:52:27.460]   Hayes.
[00:52:27.460 --> 00:52:28.460]   I can do it.
[00:52:28.460 --> 00:52:29.460]   I can do it.
[00:52:29.460 --> 00:52:30.460]   I can do it.
[00:52:30.460 --> 00:52:31.460]   I can do it.
[00:52:31.460 --> 00:52:32.460]   I can do it.
[00:52:32.460 --> 00:52:33.460]   I can do it.
[00:52:33.460 --> 00:52:35.660]   Actually, Leo LaPorte reads the classics.
[00:52:35.660 --> 00:52:36.660]   I would find it.
[00:52:36.660 --> 00:52:39.500]   Favorite Hollywood view with you, boys.
[00:52:39.500 --> 00:52:46.700]   You're mixing your people up with the Luke and it's not related to the Gabby Hayes guy.
[00:52:46.700 --> 00:52:47.700]   I met you.
[00:52:47.700 --> 00:52:48.700]   Walter Brennan.
[00:52:48.700 --> 00:52:50.700]   Was you ever stung by a dead bee?
[00:52:50.700 --> 00:52:54.140]   Sorry, I was watching that movie the other day.
[00:52:54.140 --> 00:52:55.340]   That's a great movie.
[00:52:55.340 --> 00:52:56.340]   Great movie.
[00:52:56.340 --> 00:52:57.340]   Okay.
[00:52:57.340 --> 00:53:02.820]   God, the whole thing's just come to a rapid.
[00:53:02.820 --> 00:53:05.100]   What do you do when this happens on the gang, Steve?
[00:53:05.100 --> 00:53:07.460]   I just leave the recording going.
[00:53:07.460 --> 00:53:09.260]   You do, don't you?
[00:53:09.260 --> 00:53:10.260]   You leave hours.
[00:53:10.260 --> 00:53:11.260]   Exactly.
[00:53:11.260 --> 00:53:13.820]   But he walks away.
[00:53:13.820 --> 00:53:16.940]   I do quit from time to time.
[00:53:16.940 --> 00:53:21.220]   I was talking to Arrington yesterday and we were reminiscing about the good old days
[00:53:21.220 --> 00:53:23.180]   when I fired him.
[00:53:23.180 --> 00:53:24.180]   That was great.
[00:53:24.180 --> 00:53:25.580]   Now, was that a stunt?
[00:53:25.580 --> 00:53:26.580]   No.
[00:53:26.580 --> 00:53:34.740]   So he fired me for having the temerity to have Nick Carr on the show because he didn't like
[00:53:34.740 --> 00:53:35.740]   Nick Carr.
[00:53:35.740 --> 00:53:38.820]   So in those days, Valley Wagg thought this was interesting.
[00:53:38.820 --> 00:53:40.580]   So it got pretty good.
[00:53:40.580 --> 00:53:41.580]   I loved it.
[00:53:41.580 --> 00:53:42.580]   I thought it was a stunt, though.
[00:53:42.580 --> 00:53:44.580]   I mean, that's the kind of thing you do in a radio station.
[00:53:44.580 --> 00:53:50.980]   You know, I remember Don Imus was feuding with Pete Franklin on WFAN and they would
[00:53:50.980 --> 00:53:53.180]   go back and Franklin to the afternoons and Don Imus to the morning.
[00:53:53.180 --> 00:53:54.180]   I worked with Pete.
[00:53:54.180 --> 00:53:55.180]   Pete was a character.
[00:53:55.180 --> 00:53:56.180]   Talk about inside baseball.
[00:53:56.180 --> 00:53:58.300]   Man, and they were feuding back and forth.
[00:53:58.300 --> 00:54:02.460]   At one point, Pete goes in and steals all the microphones from the studio.
[00:54:02.460 --> 00:54:04.300]   Imus comes in at 5.30 to do his show.
[00:54:04.300 --> 00:54:05.900]   There's no microphones in the studio.
[00:54:05.900 --> 00:54:08.340]   He actually goes to the payphone out in the street.
[00:54:08.340 --> 00:54:11.940]   This is the days when they still had him and does the show from the phone.
[00:54:11.940 --> 00:54:14.380]   Now obviously a stunt, but a great stunt.
[00:54:14.380 --> 00:54:16.260]   They got all in New York talking.
[00:54:16.260 --> 00:54:22.180]   So here's now, I think Prager deleted his Twitters on this on this CNET to buy revision
[00:54:22.180 --> 00:54:23.180]   three.
[00:54:23.180 --> 00:54:27.540]   Everybody has saved this on his Flickr account.
[00:54:27.540 --> 00:54:29.980]   And here's the Twitters.
[00:54:29.980 --> 00:54:34.740]   This was, I would say this is a day ago because I anyway, Dr. Tiki says the real number is
[00:54:34.740 --> 00:54:36.660]   57 million.
[00:54:36.660 --> 00:54:45.740]   Prager says, oh, he tries to direct message Dr. Tiki, but he accidentally types DS.
[00:54:45.740 --> 00:54:46.740]   And so it's public.
[00:54:46.740 --> 00:54:49.660]   DS, Dr. Tiki, this is totally NDA.
[00:54:49.660 --> 00:54:50.660]   Call me.
[00:54:50.660 --> 00:54:54.220]   Dr. Tiki then says, okay, here's the real deal.
[00:54:54.220 --> 00:54:57.300]   CNET is trying to get revision three for 57.
[00:54:57.300 --> 00:55:00.980]   And then Prager says, time to buy some crystal.
[00:55:00.980 --> 00:55:01.980]   It's below any.
[00:55:01.980 --> 00:55:02.980]   They're just playing.
[00:55:02.980 --> 00:55:03.980]   You think it's a stunt?
[00:55:03.980 --> 00:55:04.980]   Yeah.
[00:55:04.980 --> 00:55:06.780]   Why would CNET buy revision three?
[00:55:06.780 --> 00:55:10.780]   No, you know, I never see Prager as a guy who does either stunts or has much of a sense
[00:55:10.780 --> 00:55:11.780]   of humor.
[00:55:11.780 --> 00:55:12.780]   Yes, that's true.
[00:55:12.780 --> 00:55:16.820]   Have you seen any of the videos he's done, like the Facebook, the Facebook videos and
[00:55:16.820 --> 00:55:17.820]   the music videos?
[00:55:17.820 --> 00:55:20.180]   Were you with the music video that he did with the Zuckerberg sister?
[00:55:20.180 --> 00:55:21.180]   No, I didn't.
[00:55:21.180 --> 00:55:22.900]   I never thought of him as a comic.
[00:55:22.900 --> 00:55:24.500]   Let's put it that way.
[00:55:24.500 --> 00:55:25.500]   Or a prankster.
[00:55:25.500 --> 00:55:26.500]   Am I wrong?
[00:55:26.500 --> 00:55:27.500]   I think he's more deadpan.
[00:55:27.500 --> 00:55:28.500]   I think he's more deadpan.
[00:55:28.500 --> 00:55:29.500]   I could be.
[00:55:29.500 --> 00:55:30.500]   He's more a wankster than a prankster.
[00:55:30.500 --> 00:55:31.500]   It's very wrong.
[00:55:31.500 --> 00:55:32.500]   Deadpan.
[00:55:32.500 --> 00:55:33.500]   I could see the deadpan.
[00:55:33.500 --> 00:55:39.860]   Why is it so crazy that CNET might be trying to enter this new media?
[00:55:39.860 --> 00:55:41.660]   It actually makes a lot of sense.
[00:55:41.660 --> 00:55:42.660]   They're already running.
[00:55:42.660 --> 00:55:44.140]   You said, Patrick, they're already running your show.
[00:55:44.140 --> 00:55:45.140]   They know how well it does.
[00:55:45.140 --> 00:55:49.980]   Well, they're carrying it on the CNET TV.
[00:55:49.980 --> 00:55:54.180]   Well, that gives them a very good idea of their value, of your value.
[00:55:54.180 --> 00:55:56.620]   Maybe they said, wow, this stuff works well.
[00:55:56.620 --> 00:55:57.620]   Let's get it.
[00:55:57.620 --> 00:56:01.980]   Aren't we starting to see a bunch of, for example, I saw something on TechCrunch today
[00:56:01.980 --> 00:56:06.900]   where Arrington wrote a story and of course he'd twitted it.
[00:56:06.900 --> 00:56:13.700]   It said, he said in the tweet that this had been picked up by Yahoo News.
[00:56:13.700 --> 00:56:16.700]   He got 900 comments on this particular thing.
[00:56:16.700 --> 00:56:22.780]   How are you giving this kind of acceleration going with the big media, picking up the
[00:56:22.780 --> 00:56:30.060]   littler media and essentially becoming syndication hubs for these new media plays?
[00:56:30.060 --> 00:56:31.060]   Makes sense.
[00:56:31.060 --> 00:56:32.060]   He solves a lot of the problems.
[00:56:32.060 --> 00:56:33.060]   I mean, you don't have to worry about bandwidth.
[00:56:33.060 --> 00:56:34.060]   You don't have to worry about infrastructure.
[00:56:34.060 --> 00:56:41.420]   He doesn't solve the problem of the poor reader stuck with a 900 comment post.
[00:56:41.420 --> 00:56:43.500]   Is there really a 900 comment post?
[00:56:43.500 --> 00:56:44.500]   Yeah.
[00:56:44.500 --> 00:56:45.500]   Really?
[00:56:45.500 --> 00:56:46.900]   I'm thinking about Japan.
[00:56:46.900 --> 00:56:47.900]   Oh, yeah.
[00:56:47.900 --> 00:56:49.500]   One thousand fifteen comments.
[00:56:49.500 --> 00:56:51.100]   Did you read that story?
[00:56:51.100 --> 00:56:52.940]   Japanese ISPs to ban file shares.
[00:56:52.940 --> 00:56:58.780]   Japan has decided to beat France and the United Kingdom, both of whom have similar proposals
[00:56:58.780 --> 00:57:04.060]   to become the first country to ban file shares from the internet.
[00:57:04.060 --> 00:57:08.460]   It's coming not from Japanese, the Japanese government from Japan's four ISP organizations
[00:57:08.460 --> 00:57:10.500]   after pressure from the record and movie industries.
[00:57:10.500 --> 00:57:11.500]   Yeah.
[00:57:11.500 --> 00:57:14.620]   Well, I'm not surprised you're getting a lot of comments on that.
[00:57:14.620 --> 00:57:15.620]   They're banning...
[00:57:15.620 --> 00:57:17.700]   They're banning for life from the internet.
[00:57:17.700 --> 00:57:18.700]   File sharing.
[00:57:18.700 --> 00:57:19.700]   Wow.
[00:57:19.700 --> 00:57:22.420]   But see, that's the difference between the Japanese and us.
[00:57:22.420 --> 00:57:23.420]   And I think that...
[00:57:23.420 --> 00:57:26.780]   Yeah, the difference is that they're obviously the bigger A-holes.
[00:57:26.780 --> 00:57:27.780]   Right.
[00:57:27.780 --> 00:57:29.140]   I mean, who's going to jump on this thing?
[00:57:29.140 --> 00:57:31.740]   Oh, I want to be first at being an A-hole.
[00:57:31.740 --> 00:57:34.140]   So I'm going to ban this thing before anybody else does.
[00:57:34.140 --> 00:57:35.140]   So I can be number one.
[00:57:35.140 --> 00:57:36.900]   It's your peril I might add.
[00:57:36.900 --> 00:57:37.980]   At your peril I might add.
[00:57:37.980 --> 00:57:39.540]   I think that that makes you a...
[00:57:39.540 --> 00:57:43.180]   You start blocking the internet and makes you a second-rate nation.
[00:57:43.180 --> 00:57:45.780]   It's also how alternative networks get launched.
[00:57:45.780 --> 00:57:46.780]   Yeah, it's true.
[00:57:46.780 --> 00:57:47.780]   Alternative internet.
[00:57:47.780 --> 00:57:50.780]   I mean, how are they going to ban people from the internet?
[00:57:50.780 --> 00:57:51.780]   How are they going to...
[00:57:51.780 --> 00:57:53.980]   I'm going to use your personal identification number.
[00:57:53.980 --> 00:57:59.380]   You have to type it in every time you log in to be signed into the government server
[00:57:59.380 --> 00:58:00.380]   system.
[00:58:00.380 --> 00:58:04.660]   The government will have to buy Cisco in order to make that stick.
[00:58:04.660 --> 00:58:06.700]   Cisco in every Cisco alternative, maybe.
[00:58:06.700 --> 00:58:11.580]   Well, but if you get into the Cisco packets and to the routers, then you've done it.
[00:58:11.580 --> 00:58:16.580]   Did you see that there were pirated or I should say counterfeit Cisco routers being sold
[00:58:16.580 --> 00:58:19.260]   from China that in fact had backdoor code in them?
[00:58:19.260 --> 00:58:20.860]   They were labeled Cisco.
[00:58:20.860 --> 00:58:25.060]   The Chinese government, apparently, or somebody in China, I would guess the government, although
[00:58:25.060 --> 00:58:32.060]   they always deny this, trying to infiltrate networks exactly that way, selling a "Sisco
[00:58:32.060 --> 00:58:34.900]   router" with firmware that is corrupted.
[00:58:34.900 --> 00:58:35.900]   Wow.
[00:58:35.900 --> 00:58:37.700]   Isn't that an interesting story?
[00:58:37.700 --> 00:58:38.860]   Yeah, that's great.
[00:58:38.860 --> 00:58:40.900]   That's how you take over the world.
[00:58:40.900 --> 00:58:41.900]   We need to know.
[00:58:41.900 --> 00:58:42.900]   We found something.
[00:58:42.900 --> 00:58:43.900]   Finally, we talked about it.
[00:58:43.900 --> 00:58:44.900]   We need to know.
[00:58:44.900 --> 00:58:45.900]   Yeah, at the end.
[00:58:45.900 --> 00:58:49.820]   Is it the end?
[00:58:49.820 --> 00:58:54.260]   It is for me.
[00:58:54.260 --> 00:58:56.540]   You don't want to talk about Yahoo buzz?
[00:58:56.540 --> 00:59:02.380]   Mike, also talking about that in TechCrunch today, says that Yahoo is apparently buzz, which
[00:59:02.380 --> 00:59:07.620]   is their dig clone, been very good at sending traffic to outside sites.
[00:59:07.620 --> 00:59:14.100]   In fact, Yahoo says they've sent 16 million visitors in the first two weeks to outside
[00:59:14.100 --> 00:59:15.100]   sites.
[00:59:15.100 --> 00:59:20.780]   Salon claiming they got one million unique visits in one day from a story on Yahoo buzz.
[00:59:20.780 --> 00:59:26.300]   Us magazine had their second highest traffic day ever from Yahoo buzz.
[00:59:26.300 --> 00:59:31.900]   Huffington Post reporting 800,000 unique from a buzz story.
[00:59:31.900 --> 00:59:32.900]   This is a surprise.
[00:59:32.900 --> 00:59:33.900]   Wow.
[00:59:33.900 --> 00:59:34.900]   I don't think-
[00:59:34.900 --> 00:59:38.540]   Is that because they spammed everybody with a Yahoo email account?
[00:59:38.540 --> 00:59:39.540]   I have no idea.
[00:59:39.540 --> 00:59:44.900]   No, it buzzes a dig website, a dig style website where you vote on stories and apparently it's
[00:59:44.900 --> 00:59:47.380]   doing very well.
[00:59:47.380 --> 00:59:52.740]   This is why, by the way, they believe that the thousand comments on Duncan Riley's post
[00:59:52.740 --> 00:59:53.740]   on TechCrunch, Mike saying-
[00:59:53.740 --> 00:59:54.740]   They have, they believe that that-
[00:59:54.740 --> 00:59:57.740]   They believe at least on the Yahoo front door.
[00:59:57.740 --> 00:59:59.940]   Oh, and a lot of people see that, don't they?
[00:59:59.940 --> 01:00:04.260]   I mean, if people have Yahoo as their homepage, and I'm sure a lot of people still do, they'd
[01:00:04.260 --> 01:00:07.420]   see that and it says, "Vote for the web, it's hot as stories."
[01:00:07.420 --> 01:00:08.420]   So they're like-
[01:00:08.420 --> 01:00:09.420]   Interesting.
[01:00:09.420 --> 01:00:10.420]   Yep.
[01:00:10.420 --> 01:00:16.220]   Mike says that that Japanese ISP story went live at 545 as one of the bottom four links
[01:00:16.220 --> 01:00:21.900]   in the news box on the front page of Yahoo, Yahoo buzz, was up all day.
[01:00:21.900 --> 01:00:26.140]   He says, "Despite the fact that it was a Saturday, which is the slowest day of the week and was
[01:00:26.140 --> 01:00:33.700]   only up a quarter of the day, we had our highest traffic day ever and 1,015 comments on the
[01:00:33.700 --> 01:00:37.220]   post, the traffic almost brought TechCrunch down."
[01:00:37.220 --> 01:00:38.220]   Wow.
[01:00:38.220 --> 01:00:39.220]   Really?
[01:00:39.220 --> 01:00:40.220]   Buzz is-
[01:00:40.220 --> 01:00:44.340]   That's got to be driving Kevin a little crazy.
[01:00:44.340 --> 01:00:48.020]   This is a dig clone and it's already completely out of control.
[01:00:48.020 --> 01:00:50.260]   Digg, never did anything like that.
[01:00:50.260 --> 01:00:51.260]   You know, there's nothing-
[01:00:51.260 --> 01:00:56.940]   Well, one, Diggs crushed a few websites in its time and two, I mean, I think the more
[01:00:56.940 --> 01:01:00.500]   important thing is, Veronica and I are now thinking, "Hey, this is a great way to drive
[01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:01.900]   traffic to our respective-
[01:01:01.900 --> 01:01:04.460]   I'm on there right now promoting it on Yahoo buzz.
[01:01:04.460 --> 01:01:06.220]   What are you talking about?
[01:01:06.220 --> 01:01:08.220]   Come see me on Twitter."
[01:01:08.220 --> 01:01:16.100]   Okay, so here's just to point out to Patrick, how Silverlight's going to dominate once Yahoo
[01:01:16.100 --> 01:01:20.140]   is bought by Microsoft, which will happen very soon.
[01:01:20.140 --> 01:01:23.740]   Then they're going to put a little Silverlight icon on every page.
[01:01:23.740 --> 01:01:27.580]   Well, you know what it shows you is- and you're absolutely right, Steve.
[01:01:27.580 --> 01:01:33.420]   It shows you that as much as we get excited about things like Twitter and Digg, that when
[01:01:33.420 --> 01:01:39.180]   a really big site, a mainstream site like Yahoo does something, it has a- that does carry
[01:01:39.180 --> 01:01:40.180]   a lot of weight.
[01:01:40.180 --> 01:01:41.180]   That's where-
[01:01:41.180 --> 01:01:42.180]   So all of-
[01:01:42.180 --> 01:01:43.180]   That's where people really are.
[01:01:43.180 --> 01:01:46.700]   All of the executives at all of the company that have Yahoo as their homepage for their
[01:01:46.700 --> 01:01:50.580]   personal email are going to see Silverlight and they're going to go tell their CTOs that
[01:01:50.580 --> 01:01:53.340]   they have to use Silverlight on their products or projects.
[01:01:53.340 --> 01:01:59.900]   You know, they're already using Flash, but it's a 30 second or 10 second download.
[01:01:59.900 --> 01:02:01.340]   I'm not buying it.
[01:02:01.340 --> 01:02:05.500]   This is the John C. He doesn't buy it's show.
[01:02:05.500 --> 01:02:06.500]   Apparently.
[01:02:06.500 --> 01:02:10.500]   Well, when I'm on with Steve, it's always going to happen because he's like an idealistic
[01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:11.500]   crackpot.
[01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:13.340]   He's worse than me, isn't he, John?
[01:02:13.340 --> 01:02:15.740]   No, no, you're just a goody- goody two-shoes.
[01:02:15.740 --> 01:02:16.740]   You're a good guy.
[01:02:16.740 --> 01:02:18.620]   I used to- I used to be like that, though.
[01:02:18.620 --> 01:02:20.820]   I used to be like every new technology was great.
[01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:23.380]   And then John taught me the world sucks.
[01:02:23.380 --> 01:02:25.060]   Everything's going to hell in a hand basket.
[01:02:25.060 --> 01:02:26.060]   I'm a nerd.
[01:02:26.060 --> 01:02:27.060]   I'm not a goody- goody.
[01:02:27.060 --> 01:02:28.060]   The CPM.
[01:02:28.060 --> 01:02:29.060]   The most products suck.
[01:02:29.060 --> 01:02:30.060]   That's what I'm doing in the world.
[01:02:30.060 --> 01:02:31.060]   You're saying.
[01:02:31.060 --> 01:02:35.860]   No, I have a lovely idea that I'm idealistic talking about Microsoft dominating that.
[01:02:35.860 --> 01:02:36.860]   Thank you.
[01:02:36.860 --> 01:02:40.300]   Did you ever- did you work for Microsoft?
[01:02:40.300 --> 01:02:44.900]   Why is it you like- why have such a love for Microsoft?
[01:02:44.900 --> 01:02:47.180]   I've been loving Google for five years.
[01:02:47.180 --> 01:02:48.180]   I got bored.
[01:02:48.180 --> 01:02:50.180]   Hi, I'm bored too with Microsoft.
[01:02:50.180 --> 01:02:51.180]   I got a little hoard.
[01:02:51.180 --> 01:02:52.180]   I agree.
[01:02:52.180 --> 01:02:53.180]   I know what you mean.
[01:02:53.180 --> 01:02:55.180]   You need a new love.
[01:02:55.180 --> 01:02:58.180]   Whatever happened to staying true?
[01:02:58.180 --> 01:03:02.420]   Hey, so, by the way, just off fan, who's the people- because I just installed this
[01:03:02.420 --> 01:03:04.580]   today, who's the guys behind RememberTheMelk.com?
[01:03:04.580 --> 01:03:05.580]   I love that.
[01:03:05.580 --> 01:03:06.580]   They're an Australian company.
[01:03:06.580 --> 01:03:07.580]   Isn't that a great site?
[01:03:07.580 --> 01:03:08.580]   What is that?
[01:03:08.580 --> 01:03:11.420]   It's kind of cool because you- it's basically a to-do list.
[01:03:11.420 --> 01:03:12.420]   It's a- basically a to-do list.
[01:03:12.420 --> 01:03:13.420]   It's a online to-do list.
[01:03:13.420 --> 01:03:14.420]   It's an online to-do list.
[01:03:14.420 --> 01:03:18.140]   Yeah, and it interfaces with Google Calendar, so you never really have to go to this site.
[01:03:18.140 --> 01:03:19.140]   Yeah.
[01:03:19.140 --> 01:03:20.140]   No, Remember TheMelk is the best-
[01:03:20.140 --> 01:03:22.620]   Yeah, the developer has one-up hooked me up on this one.
[01:03:22.620 --> 01:03:23.620]   It's amazing.
[01:03:23.620 --> 01:03:24.620]   It's the best online to-do site.
[01:03:24.620 --> 01:03:26.260]   I've used it for about a year.
[01:03:26.260 --> 01:03:27.820]   Year and a half now.
[01:03:27.820 --> 01:03:31.260]   Rmilk.com is a short form of it.
[01:03:31.260 --> 01:03:33.100]   And it actually integrates with everything.
[01:03:33.100 --> 01:03:35.500]   That's the kind of neat thing.
[01:03:35.500 --> 01:03:38.140]   They've done a very good job of-
[01:03:38.140 --> 01:03:40.300]   So does anyone try this then?
[01:03:40.300 --> 01:03:45.380]   You take their list and then you put it on Google Calendar or Microsoft Calendar and
[01:03:45.380 --> 01:03:49.700]   then does it cross-post because Google and Microsoft both cross-post now?
[01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:51.700]   Does it double cross-post?
[01:03:51.700 --> 01:03:54.460]   And then it all gets sucked into a wormhole.
[01:03:54.460 --> 01:03:55.540]   Everybody dies.
[01:03:55.540 --> 01:03:58.140]   Do not cross the posts.
[01:03:58.140 --> 01:03:59.140]   Just wondering.
[01:03:59.140 --> 01:04:00.460]   I don't know.
[01:04:00.460 --> 01:04:01.460]   That's a big problem.
[01:04:01.460 --> 01:04:06.380]   It's actually a very big problem when you start doing this kind of RSS propagation because
[01:04:06.380 --> 01:04:08.340]   you start getting duplication.
[01:04:08.340 --> 01:04:10.900]   And in fact, you could start getting endless loops.
[01:04:10.900 --> 01:04:12.180]   I've had that happen with Jiku.
[01:04:12.180 --> 01:04:17.460]   I had my Jiku posting to Jiku and I got an endless loop and the entire world ended.
[01:04:17.460 --> 01:04:18.460]   I don't know.
[01:04:18.460 --> 01:04:20.860]   It all went down a vortex.
[01:04:20.860 --> 01:04:21.860]   This is all assimilation.
[01:04:21.860 --> 01:04:25.140]   It's like friend feed and social thing.
[01:04:25.140 --> 01:04:26.140]   Which do you use?
[01:04:26.140 --> 01:04:27.140]   Friend feed or social thing?
[01:04:27.140 --> 01:04:28.140]   I like social thing better.
[01:04:28.140 --> 01:04:29.140]   It's pretty, isn't it?
[01:04:29.140 --> 01:04:31.140]   It looks a lot better.
[01:04:31.140 --> 01:04:32.140]   Yeah.
[01:04:32.140 --> 01:04:35.500]   But I'm on both, of course, because that's my job.
[01:04:35.500 --> 01:04:38.060]   But I don't spend any time on either.
[01:04:38.060 --> 01:04:39.060]   I go to Twitter.
[01:04:39.060 --> 01:04:40.700]   Wait, stop right there.
[01:04:40.700 --> 01:04:42.060]   It's not your job.
[01:04:42.060 --> 01:04:43.060]   That's my job.
[01:04:43.060 --> 01:04:46.860]   You would be this way if you were not even involved in all of these podcasts and everything
[01:04:46.860 --> 01:04:48.860]   else, you'd still be on all these stuff.
[01:04:48.860 --> 01:04:49.860]   I'm not denying you.
[01:04:49.860 --> 01:04:50.860]   He loves his job.
[01:04:50.860 --> 01:04:51.860]   You know?
[01:04:51.860 --> 01:04:52.860]   But it's not his job.
[01:04:52.860 --> 01:04:53.860]   That's the point.
[01:04:53.860 --> 01:04:56.860]   As the Chinese say, if you love your work, you will never have a job.
[01:04:56.860 --> 01:04:58.340]   It is to his job.
[01:04:58.340 --> 01:04:59.340]   How is it not his job?
[01:04:59.340 --> 01:05:00.340]   I think he wants your change.
[01:05:00.340 --> 01:05:01.340]   People look to him.
[01:05:01.340 --> 01:05:03.340]   I kick my butt right now.
[01:05:03.340 --> 01:05:08.300]   Yeah, but what I'm saying is what he's using is as a rationale as though if he weren't,
[01:05:08.300 --> 01:05:11.060]   if people weren't looking to him, he wouldn't be doing any of this.
[01:05:11.060 --> 01:05:12.060]   He'd be on the beach right now.
[01:05:12.060 --> 01:05:13.860]   I'd be reading a paper book.
[01:05:13.860 --> 01:05:17.660]   You'd be coding in PHP.
[01:05:17.660 --> 01:05:22.660]   I was watching him all morning while I was watching the dishes as the tech guy.
[01:05:22.660 --> 01:05:24.340]   I mean, that's his job.
[01:05:24.340 --> 01:05:25.340]   That's all I do.
[01:05:25.340 --> 01:05:27.580]   He's got a TV show called the Tech Guy.
[01:05:27.580 --> 01:05:29.380]   It's a radio show, but it's now it's a video.
[01:05:29.380 --> 01:05:30.380]   It's a TV show for me.
[01:05:30.380 --> 01:05:31.380]   Yeah.
[01:05:31.380 --> 01:05:33.540]   I can't believe you watched it, Steve.
[01:05:33.540 --> 01:05:36.020]   I did because I was forced to watch the dishes.
[01:05:36.020 --> 01:05:37.020]   I have a new theory.
[01:05:37.020 --> 01:05:40.460]   I took my air, which I don't take with me everywhere.
[01:05:40.460 --> 01:05:44.380]   I take it only to the bathroom or to wash the dishes.
[01:05:44.380 --> 01:05:45.900]   Thanks for sharing.
[01:05:45.900 --> 01:05:46.900]   Yeah.
[01:05:46.900 --> 01:05:48.740]   At least it's clean.
[01:05:48.740 --> 01:05:52.940]   I ran my keyboard through the dishwasher, actually, so there's kind of a relationship
[01:05:52.940 --> 01:05:53.940]   there.
[01:05:53.940 --> 01:05:55.260]   I tried to do that and broke it.
[01:05:55.260 --> 01:05:58.820]   Well, you got to let it dry thoroughly, like for weeks.
[01:05:58.820 --> 01:06:00.860]   Then you can use it again.
[01:06:00.860 --> 01:06:05.140]   Once it there's no moisture involved, you can use it again after that.
[01:06:05.140 --> 01:06:07.860]   It'll probably also do the fact that I put syrup in it.
[01:06:07.860 --> 01:06:09.500]   Don't put syrup in it.
[01:06:09.500 --> 01:06:10.500]   Just dishwasher detergent.
[01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:12.180]   I think I learned that from Patrick.
[01:06:12.180 --> 01:06:15.660]   Didn't you use to wash the keyboards in the dishwasher at the TV?
[01:06:15.660 --> 01:06:16.940]   I've done Stranger Things.
[01:06:16.940 --> 01:06:17.940]   Yes.
[01:06:17.940 --> 01:06:20.220]   I learned that from you, as a matter of fact.
[01:06:20.220 --> 01:06:21.580]   Where did you get syrup in it?
[01:06:21.580 --> 01:06:24.460]   Oh, it was a Mahalo video that went horribly, horribly wrong.
[01:06:24.460 --> 01:06:25.460]   Hey, you flew.
[01:06:25.460 --> 01:06:27.820]   You flew on Mahalo daily the other day.
[01:06:27.820 --> 01:06:28.820]   I did.
[01:06:28.820 --> 01:06:29.820]   What?
[01:06:29.820 --> 01:06:30.820]   That was so cool.
[01:06:30.820 --> 01:06:31.820]   Yeah.
[01:06:31.820 --> 01:06:36.260]   I did a introductory flight lesson over at Santa Monica Airport with American flyers.
[01:06:36.260 --> 01:06:37.700]   Yeah, it was great.
[01:06:37.700 --> 01:06:39.540]   I really like what you're doing with Mahalo daily.
[01:06:39.540 --> 01:06:45.340]   To me, this is a great daily.mahalo.com.
[01:06:45.340 --> 01:06:47.700]   Everybody should watch every day.
[01:06:47.700 --> 01:06:48.700]   Is it daily now?
[01:06:48.700 --> 01:06:50.180]   I mean, Monday through Friday, daily.
[01:06:50.180 --> 01:06:51.540]   Yep, Monday through Friday now.
[01:06:51.540 --> 01:06:52.540]   Yeah.
[01:06:52.540 --> 01:06:53.540]   Yeah.
[01:06:53.540 --> 01:06:56.420]   How to become a private pilot, how to become a recreational pilot?
[01:06:56.420 --> 01:06:57.420]   You do it all.
[01:06:57.420 --> 01:06:58.420]   Getting a flying certificate.
[01:06:58.420 --> 01:07:00.340]   How to get your private pilot certificate.
[01:07:00.340 --> 01:07:01.340]   Yes.
[01:07:01.340 --> 01:07:05.420]   Are you going to do that or is it just kind of fun?
[01:07:05.420 --> 01:07:08.860]   It's like $12,000 to get your license there.
[01:07:08.860 --> 01:07:09.860]   Maybe sometimes.
[01:07:09.860 --> 01:07:10.860]   Maybe some days.
[01:07:10.860 --> 01:07:11.860]   It's the future.
[01:07:11.860 --> 01:07:16.700]   What is the number one downloaded, most downloaded Mahalo daily yet?
[01:07:16.700 --> 01:07:20.940]   The number one downloaded is the Mac world in 60 seconds.
[01:07:20.940 --> 01:07:22.140]   The Steve Jobs keynote.
[01:07:22.140 --> 01:07:23.660]   Yeah, the keynote.
[01:07:23.660 --> 01:07:24.660]   Those are great.
[01:07:24.660 --> 01:07:27.580]   You did that with the Oscars too.
[01:07:27.580 --> 01:07:28.580]   Mm-hmm.
[01:07:28.580 --> 01:07:29.980]   I love that.
[01:07:29.980 --> 01:07:31.980]   The poor guys got to spend all day editing.
[01:07:31.980 --> 01:07:32.980]   Ha ha ha.
[01:07:32.980 --> 01:07:33.980]   But then--
[01:07:33.980 --> 01:07:35.980]   It's pretty good at picking out which parts to put in the--
[01:07:35.980 --> 01:07:36.980]   They're excellent.
[01:07:36.980 --> 01:07:37.980]   It's excellent.
[01:07:37.980 --> 01:07:39.740]   It's excellent.
[01:07:39.740 --> 01:07:41.300]   So that's your plug.
[01:07:41.300 --> 01:07:45.500]   daily.mahalo.com with Veronica Belmont.
[01:07:45.500 --> 01:07:50.060]   It's not live streaming like this, but hey, it's the next best thing.
[01:07:50.060 --> 01:07:51.060]   Thanks.
[01:07:51.060 --> 01:07:52.060]   Who was it?
[01:07:52.060 --> 01:07:54.660]   Who was it?
[01:07:54.660 --> 01:07:59.460]   I think it was Chris Perilla was streaming from his car today.
[01:07:59.460 --> 01:08:00.460]   Oh gosh.
[01:08:00.460 --> 01:08:02.380]   Hey, I have a question for you guys.
[01:08:02.380 --> 01:08:08.260]   I saw a video today of him freaking out because his Mac crashed while he was on the air.
[01:08:08.260 --> 01:08:13.660]   Basically, you know, whispering sweet nothings into its ear and saying how much he loves
[01:08:13.660 --> 01:08:14.660]   Max now.
[01:08:14.660 --> 01:08:15.660]   Was that true?
[01:08:15.660 --> 01:08:16.660]   Yeah.
[01:08:16.660 --> 01:08:18.260]   No, he's abandoned windows and become a Mac guy.
[01:08:18.260 --> 01:08:21.180]   But was the whole Mac crashing as he was talking about that stage?
[01:08:21.180 --> 01:08:22.340]   Oh, who knows?
[01:08:22.340 --> 01:08:26.420]   We can't tell with Chris anymore because he's known to be staging things.
[01:08:26.420 --> 01:08:27.780]   Because he freaked out.
[01:08:27.780 --> 01:08:29.380]   It was pretty funny.
[01:08:29.380 --> 01:08:30.740]   He does freak out.
[01:08:30.740 --> 01:08:32.380]   I think it was probably fake.
[01:08:32.380 --> 01:08:33.380]   I think so too.
[01:08:33.380 --> 01:08:34.300]   You have to ask Chris.
[01:08:34.300 --> 01:08:39.140]   But you know, a lot of what he does is a theater.
[01:08:39.140 --> 01:08:41.740]   It was funny either way.
[01:08:41.740 --> 01:08:42.740]   Yeah.
[01:08:42.740 --> 01:08:43.740]   Good theater.
[01:08:43.740 --> 01:08:44.740]   The theater of Chris.
[01:08:44.740 --> 01:08:46.140]   The theater of the Perilla.
[01:08:46.140 --> 01:08:47.900]   He's my inspiration for doing this streaming video.
[01:08:47.900 --> 01:08:51.740]   I mean, he's been, you know, doing that for some time now.
[01:08:51.740 --> 01:08:58.060]   Patrick Norton is on tech Zilla T E K Z I L L A.
[01:08:58.060 --> 01:08:59.060]   True.
[01:08:59.060 --> 01:09:04.380]   At revision three.com/techzilla and you're still doing the co-host search.
[01:09:04.380 --> 01:09:05.380]   Yeah.
[01:09:05.380 --> 01:09:12.820]   We had a co-host picked and then something went horribly wrong and we're still working
[01:09:12.820 --> 01:09:13.820]   on finalizing that.
[01:09:13.820 --> 01:09:16.060]   You cannot build androids from Marshmallows.
[01:09:16.060 --> 01:09:17.780]   I keep telling you that.
[01:09:17.780 --> 01:09:22.860]   Actually, that's an entirely different conversation.
[01:09:22.860 --> 01:09:24.100]   Techzilla is a really great watching.
[01:09:24.100 --> 01:09:28.900]   And yeah, now you can watch it on scene at TV.com as well as revision three.
[01:09:28.900 --> 01:09:29.900]   57 million.
[01:09:29.900 --> 01:09:30.900]   That's good.
[01:09:30.900 --> 01:09:31.900]   Do you get any of that, Patrick?
[01:09:31.900 --> 01:09:37.900]   You know, I refuse to comment on any Burmursa, revision three, sold or being not sold.
[01:09:37.900 --> 01:09:41.300]   Because if I, if I do comment, I'm going to get my ass kicked on Monday.
[01:09:41.300 --> 01:09:45.900]   So far as I know, it's whatever Jason is true.
[01:09:45.900 --> 01:09:48.660]   Mr. Adelson knows what's going on.
[01:09:48.660 --> 01:09:49.660]   I would hope.
[01:09:49.660 --> 01:09:50.660]   Yes.
[01:09:50.660 --> 01:09:52.420]   John C. Devorak, you know where to find him.
[01:09:52.420 --> 01:09:53.420]   Devorak.org/blog.
[01:09:53.420 --> 01:09:55.260]   And now he does like 80 other things too.
[01:09:55.260 --> 01:09:57.020]   Like you're doing cranky geeks on Wednesdays.
[01:09:57.020 --> 01:09:58.020]   You do tech.
[01:09:58.020 --> 01:09:59.340]   Does it tech five, take five?
[01:09:59.340 --> 01:10:01.180]   Tech five, tech five, tech five.
[01:10:01.180 --> 01:10:02.740]   Dot POTCHO dot com daily.
[01:10:02.740 --> 01:10:03.740]   Yeah.
[01:10:03.740 --> 01:10:05.540]   And you didn't get laid off, did you?
[01:10:05.540 --> 01:10:07.780]   Because I think a bunch of people got laid off at POTCHO.
[01:10:07.780 --> 01:10:09.580]   No, I didn't as a matter of fact.
[01:10:09.580 --> 01:10:14.540]   And what it was is of course, if anybody wants to know the story, they, you know, they finished
[01:10:14.540 --> 01:10:18.300]   developing version three and they had, they ended up with too many engineers and they
[01:10:18.300 --> 01:10:23.220]   had to essentially get rid of about half of them because they don't, they're actually
[01:10:23.220 --> 01:10:24.620]   not going to need them anymore.
[01:10:24.620 --> 01:10:27.820]   And then they also changed their business model just enough so that they also had to
[01:10:27.820 --> 01:10:28.820]   emphasize sales.
[01:10:28.820 --> 01:10:33.780]   So they're actually hiring people to do sales and getting rid of people that are kind of
[01:10:33.780 --> 01:10:37.660]   producer types that aren't needed.
[01:10:37.660 --> 01:10:40.820]   So it was just a typical thing you run into on these things, these startups.
[01:10:40.820 --> 01:10:41.820]   It was a right side.
[01:10:41.820 --> 01:10:42.820]   It wasn't a big deal.
[01:10:42.820 --> 01:10:43.820]   It was.
[01:10:43.820 --> 01:10:47.980]   I think a more interesting big deal is actually the bankruptcy is of Davis, which also it doesn't
[01:10:47.980 --> 01:10:51.660]   really affect anything because it's just a way of putting off the bondholders.
[01:10:51.660 --> 01:10:52.860]   So that's not important either.
[01:10:52.860 --> 01:10:56.300]   They went chapter 11, but that was because some bondholders were saying we want our money
[01:10:56.300 --> 01:10:57.300]   now.
[01:10:57.300 --> 01:10:58.300]   Yeah, essentially.
[01:10:58.300 --> 01:11:03.380]   It doesn't mean that that's that the magazine industry is a little soft.
[01:11:03.380 --> 01:11:07.780]   No, the magazine industry is soft, but in the case of Ziff Davis from the way the books
[01:11:07.780 --> 01:11:11.020]   are being in bankruptcy is a lot better.
[01:11:11.020 --> 01:11:14.820]   It's good for me to say this, but the economy works.
[01:11:14.820 --> 01:11:18.380]   Yeah, they were saddled with a ton of debt right back in the day.
[01:11:18.380 --> 01:11:20.660]   Oh, the debt low was outrageous.
[01:11:20.660 --> 01:11:25.100]   So anyway, no, everything's nothing's changed.
[01:11:25.100 --> 01:11:30.500]   By the way, somebody just told me that you can watch revision three on the iPhone at m.revision3.com.
[01:11:30.500 --> 01:11:31.500]   That's a great idea.
[01:11:31.500 --> 01:11:32.500]   That is true.
[01:11:32.500 --> 01:11:37.340]   You can also watch an Apple TV on your Xbox 360 and our Vision 3 just got launched last
[01:11:37.340 --> 01:11:42.140]   week, which is the mobile portal for all of the revision three video for your cell phone.
[01:11:42.140 --> 01:11:43.620]   It's exciting, actually.
[01:11:43.620 --> 01:11:47.140]   And I've actually watched Mahalo Daily on my Apple TV too.
[01:11:47.140 --> 01:11:48.140]   It's neat.
[01:11:48.140 --> 01:11:49.140]   Very much.
[01:11:49.140 --> 01:11:50.140]   Yeah, it's really cool.
[01:11:50.140 --> 01:11:52.780]   Gilmore is, in fact, going to be doing some video and audio.
[01:11:52.780 --> 01:11:57.900]   I understand he is now a blogger, blogs.eweek.com/newsgang.
[01:11:57.900 --> 01:11:59.180]   I look forward to that, Steve.
[01:11:59.180 --> 01:12:00.180]   That should be fun.
[01:12:00.180 --> 01:12:01.380]   Yeah, I'm looking forward to it.
[01:12:01.380 --> 01:12:07.380]   And also, I'm really pointing at all you blogger spirit guys from the site that we're
[01:12:07.380 --> 01:12:08.380]   setting up.
[01:12:08.380 --> 01:12:09.380]   Good.
[01:12:09.380 --> 01:12:11.180]   And Steve Gilmore's gesture lab is gesture lab.com.
[01:12:11.180 --> 01:12:16.980]   And of course, you've got to participate in the news gang Monday through Friday and listen
[01:12:16.980 --> 01:12:18.780]   to the gang on Friday.
[01:12:18.780 --> 01:12:23.780]   And speaking, by the way, of Chris Parello, he just, I am to be saying, why aren't you
[01:12:23.780 --> 01:12:25.580]   live streaming yet?
[01:12:25.580 --> 01:12:29.180]   And I said, are your ears burning?
[01:12:29.180 --> 01:12:31.980]   And he says, no, I just caught your article.
[01:12:31.980 --> 01:12:33.580]   Ask him to fill his face.
[01:12:33.580 --> 01:12:35.580]   Clueful and clueless.
[01:12:35.580 --> 01:12:36.580]   Clueful and clueless.
[01:12:36.580 --> 01:12:39.580]   Yeah, ask him if he was faking that day or that outrage.
[01:12:39.580 --> 01:12:44.380]   You want me to see if he's on Skype, we could just call him.
[01:12:44.380 --> 01:12:45.380]   Let's see.
[01:12:45.380 --> 01:12:46.380]   Yeah, he is.
[01:12:46.380 --> 01:12:47.380]   Why don't you do that?
[01:12:47.380 --> 01:12:48.380]   Let's just add him in here.
[01:12:48.380 --> 01:12:49.380]   The easiest thing to do.
[01:12:49.380 --> 01:12:52.980]   Hey, Veronica, should we fake some anger on Tuesday?
[01:12:52.980 --> 01:12:53.980]   Yeah.
[01:12:53.980 --> 01:12:55.820]   Veronica's like everywhere.
[01:12:55.820 --> 01:12:57.140]   She was on Twitter today.
[01:12:57.140 --> 01:12:59.820]   She's going to be on on Techzilla on Tuesday.
[01:12:59.820 --> 01:13:02.380]   You're by the way, the best co-host on Techzilla.
[01:13:02.380 --> 01:13:03.780]   Just want to say that.
[01:13:03.780 --> 01:13:04.780]   Yeah.
[01:13:04.780 --> 01:13:05.780]   Oh, thank you.
[01:13:05.780 --> 01:13:06.780]   Everybody agrees.
[01:13:06.780 --> 01:13:07.780]   Thank you for flattering me so much.
[01:13:07.780 --> 01:13:10.780]   We're trying to get her on cranky geeks on Wednesday.
[01:13:10.780 --> 01:13:11.780]   Cranky geeks.
[01:13:11.780 --> 01:13:12.780]   Come on.
[01:13:12.780 --> 01:13:13.780]   Let's make it a hat trick.
[01:13:13.780 --> 01:13:14.780]   You should do it now, Veronica.
[01:13:14.780 --> 01:13:18.180]   You've already said everything you wanted to about.
[01:13:18.180 --> 01:13:22.380]   I just don't know if I could say, let's not talk about it now.
[01:13:22.380 --> 01:13:24.580]   Perilla's going to voicemail, unfortunately.
[01:13:24.580 --> 01:13:26.380]   He's not picking up.
[01:13:26.380 --> 01:13:28.380]   All right, a lot.
[01:13:28.380 --> 01:13:29.380]   He knows now.
[01:13:29.380 --> 01:13:30.380]   He knows we're after him.
[01:13:30.380 --> 01:13:31.980]   We're going after him.
[01:13:31.980 --> 01:13:33.860]   I got you in my sights, Perilla.
[01:13:33.860 --> 01:13:35.980]   You're on my list, dude.
[01:13:35.980 --> 01:13:36.980]   Thank you, everybody.
[01:13:36.980 --> 01:13:37.980]   Another twit.
[01:13:37.980 --> 01:13:38.980]   This is amazing.
[01:13:38.980 --> 01:13:39.980]   He's in the can.
[01:13:39.980 --> 01:13:52.460]   So, you know, in his family, it's what I was going to say that I talked to Sebastian Rupley
[01:13:52.460 --> 01:13:53.460]   about getting Veronica on.
[01:13:53.460 --> 01:13:57.980]   And the first thing I said to him was, we need to get Victoria Belmont on.
[01:13:57.980 --> 01:14:00.180]   It begins with a V and it ends with an A.
[01:14:00.180 --> 01:14:01.180]   I know.
[01:14:01.180 --> 01:14:02.980]   I know I've gotten it my whole life.
[01:14:02.980 --> 01:14:05.180]   Veronica, Veronica, Veronica, Veronica, Veronica.
[01:14:05.180 --> 01:14:06.180]   That's OK.
[01:14:06.180 --> 01:14:08.980]   I'll just make fun of you if you do it again.
[01:14:08.980 --> 01:14:09.980]   You call me Lonnie.
[01:14:09.980 --> 01:14:10.980]   Relaxed.
[01:14:10.980 --> 01:14:11.980]   So, here's the deal.
[01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:15.980]   I'm just trying to get the thing off, but I have a hell of a time when blue screens forget
[01:14:15.980 --> 01:14:16.980]   it.
[01:14:16.980 --> 01:14:17.980]   I'm killing you.
[01:14:17.980 --> 01:14:18.980]   [MUSIC]
[01:14:18.980 --> 01:14:19.980]   Do it the to it.
[01:14:19.980 --> 01:14:20.980]   All right.
[01:14:20.980 --> 01:14:21.980]   Do it the to it, baby.
[01:14:21.980 --> 01:14:22.980]   Do it the to it.
[01:14:22.980 --> 01:14:29.980]   Do it the to it.
[01:14:29.980 --> 01:14:30.980]   Do it.
