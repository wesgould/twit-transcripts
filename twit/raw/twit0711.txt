[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.640]   big tech stories of the week. Joining us, I like your New Mexican flag over your shoulder
[00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.080]   there. Ed Butt. From, what does that say, Wild?
[00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.720]   No, it says Wilco.
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.400]   Oh, Wilco. Oh, I get it.
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.400]   It's a Wilco album.
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.240]   It's a Wilco poster from when they played at the Santa Fe Opera a couple of years ago.
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.120]   Nice. But it has kind of the New Mexican flag sort of.
[00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.280]   And I put that there just so that you can, I know, a little visual cues that you can
[00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.520]   remember what state I live in. It's not Arizona.
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.360]   No, no, no, no. You're giving me credit, though, for knowing that that's the New Mexican flag.
[00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.920]   But I did know, so thank you. All the way from Alba Quirkhe.
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.520]   Still, still wrong. Still wrong.
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.160]   Still wrong. Santa Fe.
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.160]   Santa Fe. New Mexico.
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.160]   Thank you. Exactly right.
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.440]   To have you, he's the creator of the Ed Bot Report on ZDNet.
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.200]   Actually, some other guy created it. But once they realized it was called the Ed Bot Report,
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.240]   they said we better get bought. Great to have you Ed.
[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:58.360]   A long time friend going back to the early days of Dvorak on computers in the early 90s.
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:04.400]   Wow. It doesn't seem so long ago. Larry Magget is also here late in his career.
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:10.000]   He was covering Windows 95 CBS News or radio and connect safely.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.400]   Larry, great to have you. Larry's mic is not working.
[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.400]   My mic. There it is. My wife must have something to do with this.
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.400]   You're am.
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.400]   Now it's working. That's the old military percussive repair technique.
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.400]   That's why we used to fix Apple IIs.
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:31.400]   Yeah. Hey, wait a minute. Holy cow. My eyes deceive me all the way from the Vatican,
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.200]   the Pope just wrote his first line of code. Father Robert Ballis there, the digital
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.000]   Jesuit, what brings you to our neck of the woods? The teleporter, the people teleporter.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.340]   Actually, we just perfected it and I've got all my appendages, so I think it's
[00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.280]   drink pretty well. It's yeah, no fingers left behind. I like that.
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:54.360]   So it is true, isn't it? I saw this on Slashtott. The Holy Father wrote a line of code with
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.600]   code.org. It wasn't the most advanced line of code ever.
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:03.400]   No, but it did something. It absolutely did something. This is we've been pushing this
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:08.760]   more and more because this pope is actually amenable to using things from the modern world.
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.160]   So he actually, you know, he was the first pope to really use Twitter. He was the first
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.440]   pope to really use social media. He actually uses our app, the app that comes out of our
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:23.320]   office, Click to Pray. That was the app that he put to pray to pray. That's actually a
[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.760]   Jesuit thing. So yeah, I feel like a movie that took place in Indonesia.
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:33.080]   It does, right? I have to say, it looks like he's using an iPad Pro, but I could be wrong.
[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.040]   He has many different types of tech that get put in front of him. He actually doesn't
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:41.320]   own any of that. None of that's kept in his room. He doesn't keep any of that in his office.
[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.240]   It's just brought to him when it's required.
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:48.960]   Three young students and Hardy partovie, who is the head of code.org. And here's the line
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:56.400]   of code that the Pope Francis wrote. Set screen, parenthesis, pour la paz.
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:02.040]   For the peace. For the for peace and quote parenthesis. He didn't forget his semicolon.
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:06.920]   When he executed it, it showed that text on a commemorative plaque bearing the statement,
[00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:10.480]   computer science and powers young people to create peace in their communities. Everyone
[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:14.560]   should learn how to harness technology to use their creative power.
[00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:19.320]   Port la paz. That's very different than my first line of code. I tip it with print something
[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:20.240]   or print. Yeah, print.
[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:25.680]   Poor la paz. Go to. Hello world. Yeah. The first, the first piece of code that we, uh,
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.200]   we suggested was 10 God 20 go to 10.
[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:34.240]   That's, uh, that's fine. That's really funny. And he done that. I think the world would
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:39.280]   have sat up and taken notice. Uh, the world did set up and take notice earlier today when,
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:46.760]   uh, the attorney general, uh, sent a letter to Congress summarizing the Mueller reports,
[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:51.080]   conclusions. And I thought the letter was very interesting. It did acknowledge that in
[00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:56.400]   fact the Russians had attempted to, and this was what the Mueller investigation was about,
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:01.560]   is about Russian influence in the election. They indicted a great number of Russian nationals,
[00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:08.160]   along with Trump's, um, campaign chairman, but for other problems, other things, uh,
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:13.160]   or no, was he in? Yeah, he was indicted by the Mueller, uh, investigation. But most importantly,
[00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:19.560]   according to attorney general bar, uh, there is no evidence of, uh, uh, uh, the Trump
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:25.400]   organization, the Trump campaign or the president himself in, in any way working with the Russians
[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:29.080]   in the, uh, say no evidence. There's no evidence. I read you the letter because it's a little
[00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:35.080]   complicated. Um, they, the evidence isn't enough to actually indict. No, that was for
[00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:39.320]   the obstruction charge. Larry. Well, no, that's a different story. The, the, but I'm just saying,
[00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:44.280]   did I don't know if he said no evidence. That's the word there. Uh, yeah, I'll, it's actually,
[00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:49.480]   there's new, though they'll be listening. Yeah, we're doing this as we go. Um, so,
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:53.960]   uh, I think a very complete, and I think everybody would agree, a very thorough investigation over
[00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:59.560]   almost two years, uh, by Robert Mueller. As we know the report does not, and this is in the
[00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:03.640]   attorney general bars, words does not recommend any further indictments. There are no sealed
[00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:10.040]   indictments yet to be made public. Uh, bar, uh, said that, uh, the special counsel's investigation
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:14.840]   did not find, did not find that the Trump campaign or any one associated with it,
[00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:22.680]   conspired or coordinated with Russia in its efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election.
[00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:27.080]   There was no, well, in Trump's words, no collusion, although that's not what they found.
[00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:31.240]   Yeah, but I wonder how they explained the Trump tower meeting. I mean, well, they did, they don't,
[00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:35.480]   and you know, this is not the full report. This is a summary that the attorney general sent
[00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:41.320]   to Congress and I'm sure we'll see more. Um, the special counsel did not draw a conclusion
[00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:46.280]   one way or another. Again, I'm continuing to quote bar as to whether the examined conduct
[00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:51.960]   constituted obstruction. So they didn't do our conclusion one way or the other.
[00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:58.120]   Um, did not exonerate. He specifically, yeah, the special counsel states that,
[00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:01.400]   quote, while this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime,
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:09.400]   it does not exonerate him. Uh, however, I think, uh, it's pretty clear that the, the report, uh,
[00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:14.440]   lets Trump and his campaign off the hook completely, uh, and definitely says there was, you know,
[00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:19.560]   an attempt to influence the election by the internet research agency, the Russian troll farm
[00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:24.680]   and the, and the Russian government, uh, but that the Trump administration and the Trump campaign
[00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:30.600]   had nothing to do with that. He said, he said, despite many attempts by the Russians to get in touch,
[00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:37.080]   they didn't, they didn't apparently get in touch. So, uh, I think that's a big deal. And I think
[00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:41.240]   it has something to do with technology because, yeah, of course it was Facebook that was used. In fact,
[00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:46.840]   honestly, uh, the one company that's not let off the hook in this case is Facebook. They don't
[00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:50.120]   mention Facebook in the Mueller report. Well, they might. They don't mention the summary in the
[00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:53.400]   summary, but you're right. It probably will not. We haven't read the report. Yeah. I mean,
[00:08:53.400 --> 00:09:00.040]   this is an important inflection point because now everyone should reset and listen. If you've got
[00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:05.160]   celebrities, if you've got personalities, either saying that this 100% exonerates the Trump
[00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:08.840]   administration and this should forever put this issue to bed, don't listen to them. It doesn't
[00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:12.360]   do that. On the other side, if you have people who are saying, no, no, no, you have to read between
[00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:16.520]   the lines and this is absolutely a conviction and this is an indictment of the Trump administration,
[00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:20.440]   stop listening to them. You need to start listening to the centrist position. So we're
[00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:24.440]   actually going to take what's released of them all the report and hopefully because it completely
[00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:28.280]   exonerates the president of the United States, it will be released in its entirety because there's
[00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:34.280]   a lot more. There will be a lot more out of that report. This is the quote from the bar letter,
[00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:38.760]   the special counsel did not find that the Trump campaign or anyone associated with it,
[00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:42.440]   conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in these efforts, the efforts to
[00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:47.720]   influence the election and hacked by the way, the Clinton campaign, the Democratic Party,
[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:54.120]   despite multiple offers from Russian affiliated officials, individuals, I should say, to assist
[00:09:54.120 --> 00:10:01.240]   the Trump campaign. So that's that is a very unequivocal note is worth reading, right? Also,
[00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:05.640]   Leo, in assessing the footnote right below and assessing potential conspiracy charges,
[00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:10.120]   a special counsel also considered whether members of the Trump campaign coordinated
[00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:15.240]   with Russian election interference activities. We know that Manafort is accused of offering
[00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:22.840]   polling data to a Russian oligarch, the special counsel defined coordination as an agreement,
[00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:28.280]   tacit or express between the Trump campaign and the Russian government on election interference.
[00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:34.120]   So because there was no tacit or implicit agreement, well, he was looking for tit for
[00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:38.920]   Tet and we don't have that. There is there is no express agreement that the Mueller investigation
[00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:42.200]   that frankly, if you do this, I will do that. That doesn't surprise me.
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:47.480]   Anyway, big, big, big news. And I'm sure there'll be a lot more to a report.
[00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:52.120]   But I thought we just pass it along. The interesting thing is what how is this going to affect the
[00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:57.880]   politics, both the potential for impeachment, the hearings that are likely to come up or maybe not,
[00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:02.840]   I mean, I think it's going to be a very interesting political the next few weeks. The Democrats have
[00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:07.080]   got to really sort of rethink their strategy in terms of how they go after the president.
[00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:10.360]   There's still plenty of reasons that they can go after the president, but I think they have to
[00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:14.200]   rethink how they go about doing it. But if you look at the indictments, the indictments that had to do
[00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:19.480]   with this all were of Russian nationals, the special counsel again from the bar letter found
[00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:23.880]   that the Russian government actors successfully hacked into computers and obtained emails from
[00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:28.040]   persons affiliated with the Clinton campaign and Democratic Party organizations and publicly
[00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:33.080]   disseminated those materials through various intermediaries, including wiki leaks and, of course,
[00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:37.080]   the special counsel brought indictments against a number of Russian military officers.
[00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:40.920]   It was not at which because of that. The way I read it is there's one
[00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:45.720]   incontrovertible fact that you can take from this summary release, which is,
[00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:52.200]   Mueller did his job and he did it with integrity. There was not a single leak out of him. There
[00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:57.880]   wasn't a single saber rattle out of his camp. This was not a witch hunt. This was not any of the
[00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:01.400]   things that it was accused of being. This was a person who was tasked with the job and he did it
[00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:06.360]   to the fullest of his abilities. So let's put that away because that's also been a huge
[00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:11.320]   contention over the last two years. This was an investigation that was asked of a man of great
[00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:15.640]   honor who has done a great service for this country and he just did it again. Okay, what's next?
[00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:22.520]   And we know that there's another election coming up in 2020 and that the Russians will probably not be
[00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:29.320]   slowed down by this report in any way. It will all start all over again if it hasn't already
[00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:35.160]   started all over again. That's the technological side. That's the technology story for us, which is
[00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:40.040]   we've spent two years looking at this and we are no more prepared for information warfare than we
[00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:45.080]   were in the 2016 election. And what are we doing other than holding a hearing every once in a while
[00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:49.560]   and bringing a CEO to task for some privacy invasion? We should actually be looking at,
[00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:55.480]   well, how is this actually affecting the election process? And it's too late for the next election.
[00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:59.000]   We've only got two years. We're already within the cycle. We should have been looking at this
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:05.800]   two years ago. Incidentally, the news lately has been that Facebook did in fact talk to Cambridge
[00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:09.960]   Analytica. I knew what they were up to long before they talked about it publicly.
[00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:15.720]   Facebook staff, according to the BBC, flagged Cambridge Analytica fears earlier than
[00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:20.120]   thought three months earlier than thought according to US court documents. That was in September
[00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:27.400]   2015, more than a year before the election. Facebook said it discovered this in December
[00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:33.880]   2015, three months later. And there was even evidence that a Facebook board member had met with
[00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:39.320]   Chris Whittle, who was the whistleblower at Cambridge Analytica in that time frame. So
[00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:45.400]   somebody who is not off the hook by any means is Facebook. And I think we're going to hear a
[00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:50.280]   lot more about that. It's interesting. I was actually at the event when Facebook announced
[00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:55.000]   their app ecosystem. And if you don't believe me, you can Google this because Cara Swisher
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.760]   actually documented this. I asked Zuckerberg, aren't you worried that if you open up your
[00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:04.280]   ecosystem to independent developers that there could be some kind of a security breach?
[00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:11.160]   And this was back, I think in 2010. And he didn't have a good answer. He really didn't have
[00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:18.520]   an answer to an obvious question, which what happens if you open it up to the world? And
[00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:22.760]   Cambridge Analytica certainly proved that. Yeah. Chris Whittle, not Whittle. Chris Whittle,
[00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:27.480]   somebody else. Chris Whittle is the Facebook, I'm sorry, the Cambridge Analytica whistleblower,
[00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:33.640]   who we now know met with some Facebook.
[00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:39.800]   Leo, I think there was one other development this week that is probably worth noting,
[00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:47.480]   which was that DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, I believe that is short for,
[00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:54.200]   released their developing a new voting system. Yeah, wasn't that interesting?
[00:14:54.200 --> 00:15:02.360]   Source online voting system. Yeah. It's an open source voting system. And the fact that it's not
[00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:12.920]   being done by a for profit company is and that it's open source is those are both good things.
[00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:17.960]   It's not online. I should say it's electronic voting, but it is intended that companies like
[00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:23.960]   Diebold will adapt adopt this system. I don't know if they will, but it does have a paper trail,
[00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:28.520]   which is something that computer scientists and security experts have long said has to be
[00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:35.080]   included in any voting system. DARPA has spent a lot of time and money on this. We talked about
[00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:38.760]   it on security now. Actually, according to the start of reading, they spent $10 million,
[00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:42.840]   which by government standards, it's not a lot. I guess it's not a lot to me.
[00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:49.320]   And one of the things they're going to do is they're going to bring voting machines with this new
[00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:55.000]   system to DEF CON, the hacker conference. They have that voting village where they bring voting
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.480]   machines. And of course, all of the voting machines in current use, getting hacked last year,
[00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:04.280]   they're going to be publishing source code online, bring prototypes of the system to voting
[00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:09.880]   village this summer and next so that hackers and researchers will not only be able to freely
[00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:14.600]   examine the systems, but they'll also be able to conduct pen tests to try to break into it,
[00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:18.360]   which is great. I was a little skeptical about it until I actually started digging into it. And I
[00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:22.760]   realized the company that's been contracted to do this research, they're not trying to make a
[00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:27.480]   product. They will not bring a product to market that will be sold. They're making the reference
[00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:31.640]   for it. And that's what I actually really like. They're especially the fact that they're willing
[00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:36.040]   to bring it to DEF CON. That's what generates best practices, things like what we discovered
[00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:40.440]   last year from the voting machines that we disassembled, where you have hard-coded credentials
[00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:45.080]   in firmware, you have swappable SD cards that could actually allow you to run a completely
[00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:49.880]   different operating system on the hardware. Little things like that would never have passed peer
[00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:53.880]   review. Well, if you have a company that's willing to bring it to DEF CON, where they know people
[00:16:53.880 --> 00:17:00.680]   will break it. That inspires a lot of confidence. They're going to do two basic voting machine types.
[00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:06.200]   The first will be a ballot marking device that uses a touchscreen so the voters can make their
[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:11.480]   selections. That system won't tabulate the votes, but will print out a paper ballot so that
[00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:15.400]   voters can review them before depositing them into an optical scan machine.
[00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:20.520]   Is there any explanation of why DARPA, I mean, what's, you know, they're a defense?
[00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:23.640]   I think it's exactly the kind of thing that DARPA should be doing, right?
[00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:31.720]   It's advanced research. The optical scan system will print a receipt with a cryptographic representation
[00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:37.480]   of the voter's choice. After the election, the cryptographic values for all ballots will be
[00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:43.800]   published online. So you can go as a voter and verify that your ballot's there and that the
[00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:49.160]   vote was correctly tabulated. Open source, verifiable and transparent.
[00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:51.400]   I think this is great. That's what we've been asking for.
[00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:54.760]   The second system is an optical scan system that reads paper ballots. This is what we do in
[00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:59.320]   California. We get a paper ballot. We mark it by hand, kind of one of those punch cards you've seen.
[00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:03.160]   And that'll bring that system is going to come to DEF CON.
[00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:04.120]   We know Hank's chat.
[00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:12.200]   No, Hank adds anywhere. Let me ask the panel, how many of you voted at a polling place this last
[00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:17.560]   election? Oh, I did. Oh, you did? Good for you, Ed. Good for you. I dropped off my absentee ballot
[00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:24.840]   at the polling point. Was it in Santa Fe? It was in Santa Fe. I've been absenty ballot for the last,
[00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:30.680]   what, seven election? I really like going in. So what I do is I mark it at home and take it in.
[00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:35.320]   And then I go to the polling place. I do that. And just in case I'm traveling for some of
[00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:38.760]   them, I want to make sure. But if I can go to the polling place, I love going there.
[00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:41.800]   I do too. I love what I used to consider old people, but now they're my age.
[00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:48.520]   I'm standing around. The cops are now kids. But the people at the polling place are our peers.
[00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:50.200]   Exactly. That's okay.
[00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:58.120]   In New Mexico, we have early voting for almost a month before the election. So although we can do
[00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:04.360]   ballot by mail, or we can fill them out and drop them off at the county clerk's office,
[00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:09.400]   or you can fill them out and drop them off at one of the early voting places. But there's a half a
[00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:16.680]   dozen early voting locations around town that you can go to. So it's pretty convenient. We just
[00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:21.960]   went and voted and then went and had breakfast at one of our favorite restaurants around the corner.
[00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:26.280]   So it became a social thing. We brought a few friends with us.
[00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:30.280]   Hello, Alton has a ballot drop off at the library. It kind of looked like big mailboxes.
[00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:32.040]   You just put your ballot right there at the library.
[00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:32.680]   That's secure.
[00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:38.680]   To answer your question, actually, I'm reading further at Motherboard.
[00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:45.080]   The voting system, grad of a larger program focused on developing generally secure hardware.
[00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:50.600]   The program called System Security Integrated Through Hardware or Firmware or SITH
[00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:56.840]   was launched in 2017. It's apparently hard to do secure hardware.
[00:19:56.840 --> 00:20:03.160]   And so it was aimed developing secure hardware and design tools to build that hardware so that
[00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:07.000]   hardware would be impervious to most of the software attacks prevalence today. And there's
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.280]   a part of SITH. SITH. SITH. Oh, Lord.
[00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:16.200]   Are the SITH. The ones with the funny faces and the double-sided.
[00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:20.920]   You know, that's not really true. I have a blender, which is far as I could tell is
[00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:23.640]   very secure. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. It's very secure.
[00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:30.040]   Apparently, this is the quote from SITH. Software has been the way people try to solve the problems
[00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:35.160]   because software is adaptable. There are some hardware security solutions already,
[00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:38.440]   but they don't go far enough and require too much power and performance.
[00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:43.160]   We want to fix this in hardware. And then no matter what software vulnerabilities you have,
[00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:47.320]   attackers couldn't exploit them. The problem is most hardware is gullible.
[00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:48.680]   Did you know that?
[00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:54.040]   Most hard and has no way of distinguishing between acceptable and unacceptable behavior.
[00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:57.400]   And you heard about the defibrillator hack that was demonstrated this week.
[00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:58.120]   Nice.
[00:20:58.120 --> 00:20:58.600]   Another...
[00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:01.400]   SITH. So these defibrillator machines are all over the place.
[00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:06.120]   This is actually embedded. It's like a pacemaker. It's embedded in the patient's chest.
[00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:11.240]   And it comes with a radio remote control. So all you have to do is to spoof the codes on
[00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:13.960]   your own radio and go control somebody's chest.
[00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:17.640]   SITH. And that brings us to PON to OWN.
[00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:26.840]   The PON to OWN week was a big one. A lot of hacking going on. Pretty much everything was
[00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:34.200]   cracked. And a lot of it by one team, the Floro Acetate team, Amat Kama and Richard
[00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:43.480]   Jew, who earned, I think, close to $400,000 out of the $450,000 purse.
[00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:49.720]   Let's see. The PON to OWN, you know, this event that happens in Vancouver every year as part of
[00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:55.640]   CanSecWest. The contest started. I love this play by play. The contest started with a team of
[00:21:55.640 --> 00:22:01.240]   Floro Acetate, talking in the Apple Safari web browser. They successfully exploited the browser
[00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:06.360]   and escaped the sandbox by using an integer overflow in the browser and a heap overflow
[00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:10.520]   to escape the sandbox. That earned them $55,000.
[00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:10.520]   SITH.
[00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:19.800]   These guys hoard exploits all year long because they're going to make enough money in three days
[00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:26.120]   in Vancouver to fund the rest of the year. Then they came back to target the Oracle Virtual
[00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:30.520]   Box in the virtualization category. Their first attempt failed, but the second attempt
[00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:35.720]   successfully used an integer overflow and a race condition to escalate from the virtual client
[00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:42.200]   to pop-calc at medium integrity. Whatever that means. It wasn't the race condition that caused
[00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:46.360]   their failed first attempt. Their memory leak was working, but their code execution failed.
[00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:53.480]   Everything aligned in the second attempt. Ching another $35,000 and three more, master of PON points.
[00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:56.920]   SITH. Do you really want to know what pop-calc means?
[00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:57.720]   SITH. Yeah, what?
[00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:07.640]   Tell you. The idea is that if you have successfully breached the security on somebody's remote machine,
[00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:15.080]   you're able to execute arbitrary code on there. The typical way that you prove you executed code
[00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:20.520]   on their machine is to cause the calculator app to open on their machine remotely.
[00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:20.920]   SITH. It pops the calc.
[00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:20.920]   SITH.
[00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:20.920]   SITH.
[00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:20.920]   SITH.
[00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:20.920]   SITH.
[00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:20.920]   SITH.
[00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:21.920]   SITH.
[00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:22.920]   SITH.
[00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:22.920]   SITH.
[00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:23.920]   SITH.
[00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:24.920]   Did you know that Father Robert?
[00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:25.920]   SITH.
[00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:26.920]   I did not know that.
[00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:26.920]   SITH.
[00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:28.300]   Thank you, Ed, VI, Ed.
[00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:29.140]   - There you go.
[00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:30.340]   - The calculator would not be
[00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:32.420]   the first application I would think to open.
[00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:33.260]   (Eric laughing)
[00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:34.100]   - That makes sense, good go.
[00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:35.160]   - It's one of the other.
[00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:36.960]   - It's one of the least harmful things
[00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:37.780]   that they can do.
[00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:39.960]   But it's an absolute proof of concept.
[00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:43.180]   Hey, I was able to run code that was sitting on your machine
[00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:46.900]   and you weren't able to stop me, so that's the idea.
[00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:49.200]   - Oraclewood. - I would pop Notepad.
[00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:50.040]   ( resistors laughing)
[00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:50.880]   - And write.
[00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:51.880]   - You've been Poem.
[00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:53.940]   - That's why Mary-Jo Foley writes all their stories.
[00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:55.140]   - Yeah, that's right.
[00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:57.640]   - Bono newcomer, on Hot Dodden,
[00:23:57.640 --> 00:24:00.140]   on Hot Dodden of Star Labs,
[00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:02.180]   also targeted at Oracle Virtual Box.
[00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:03.620]   He used an integer underflow
[00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:05.180]   to escalate from the virtual client
[00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:07.180]   to execute his code on the hypervisor
[00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:09.140]   at medium integrity.
[00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:10.900]   And he netted $35,000.
[00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:12.060]   - That's actually scary.
[00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:14.140]   I wanna see how he did that.
[00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:15.940]   - Getting out of these virtualization environments.
[00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:16.780]   - Breaking out of it.
[00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:18.460]   - Although Virtual Box is the free one,
[00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:20.180]   it's less likely used by, I mean,
[00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:22.180]   VMware I would be more scared.
[00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:24.540]   However, I think a lot of people use it 'cause it's free.
[00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:26.420]   And I'm truly, oh, as a Tesla owner,
[00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:27.420]   you're gonna be happy to read it.
[00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:28.260]   - I'm getting there.
[00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:29.100]   - I'm getting there.
[00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:31.060]   Oh yeah, we're going through all of them.
[00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:31.900]   - Okay.
[00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:32.740]   - We're going through them all.
[00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:33.580]   - I'll stand by.
[00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:35.340]   - VMware. - I think they actually busted VMware.
[00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:36.740]   They did an out of bounds.
[00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:39.660]   - Floral acetate earned 70 grand and seven points
[00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:42.500]   for getting out of the VMware workstation.
[00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:47.500]   So in one day, two guys, $160,000, not bad.
[00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:53.060]   And then Phoenix and Quirty targeted Apple Safari.
[00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:55.660]   Now there was nobody broke in OS 10,
[00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:58.100]   but able to get into Safari is probably good enough
[00:24:58.100 --> 00:25:00.060]   with a kernel elevation that demonstrated
[00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:03.700]   a complete system compromise simply by creating
[00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:06.380]   a malicious website and browsing to it,
[00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:08.340]   triggering a Justin Time jit bug
[00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:10.460]   followed by a heap out of bounds read,
[00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:12.220]   and then pivoted from root to kernel
[00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:15.980]   via time of check, time of use bug,
[00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:19.300]   T-O-C-T-O-U to those in the know.
[00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:21.820]   Unfortunately, it was only a partial win
[00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:24.180]   since Apple already knew one of the bugs used in the demo.
[00:25:24.180 --> 00:25:25.660]   Well, that should be-- - Whoa, whoa.
[00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:26.860]   - I'm sorry.
[00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:28.380]   So they got 45 grand.
[00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:32.340]   That was just day one of Pwned to Own.
[00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:36.820]   Firefox also Pwned, and yes, Tesla was Pwned,
[00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:39.020]   but the Pwned-- - It's a shiny red one.
[00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:40.020]   - It was a Model 3, just like a driving--
[00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:42.860]   - They gave him the Tesla for me.
[00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:44.420]   - They gave him the Tesla for me.
[00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:46.580]   - Wait, did they gave the same Tesla that they had broken?
[00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:48.740]   - Apparently they gave him the Tesla that they hacked into.
[00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:51.660]   - All they did though was put a message on the browser
[00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:53.220]   in the big window. - All right.
[00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:55.420]   - So it'd be better if they had like--
[00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:56.740]   - Heck, I would've earned a free Tesla.
[00:25:56.740 --> 00:25:58.220]   - Turned the car off or something.
[00:25:58.220 --> 00:26:00.020]   - I wonder if it was the $35,000 one
[00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:02.020]   or if they gave him one of the high end ones?
[00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:03.020]   - No, I don't know.
[00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:04.300]   You wanna know, I'll see if I can find it.
[00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:06.180]   - Well, two years ago, Tesla came to DEF CON
[00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:07.780]   and they actually brought a car
[00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:08.780]   and asked people to bang on it.
[00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:09.780]   - Yeah, that's great.
[00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:12.180]   In fact, that's why these companies are happy
[00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:13.940]   to help Pwned to Own Pwned to Own Pwned.
[00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:14.780]   - It's worse than-- - It's worse than--
[00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:16.100]   - They're getting in the box. - They're getting in the box.
[00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:17.220]   - Right. - To get to know
[00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:25.540]   where you're voting with. - Oh, I've always worried a little bit
[00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:28.940]   at about the fact that these guys are finding these exploits
[00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:32.220]   and sitting on them until the next Pwned to Own.
[00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:36.220]   - Well, that's certainly preferable to the alternative,
[00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:40.220]   which is to find those exploits, sit on them,
[00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:42.220]   and then sell them to a nation-state
[00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:47.220]   of hacking companies that exist to serve the needs
[00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:50.900]   of usually authoritarian states.
[00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:54.020]   Egypt has been known to buy a lot of these exploits,
[00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:57.820]   for example, to spy on their own people.
[00:26:57.820 --> 00:27:02.820]   So holding onto these things to cash them in
[00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:07.780]   at a contest like this is just a hell of a lot better
[00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:10.580]   than holding onto them so that you can sell them
[00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:12.780]   to someone who's going to use them maliciously.
[00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:15.860]   - Or even leaky them to potential copycat haphra.
[00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:20.300]   - Right, although, I mean, there's no financial incentive.
[00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:21.660]   - Right, your company's like-- - The answer is,
[00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:22.500]   it's a roadie, I'm gonna send that one.
[00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:24.700]   - Spend the pay a lot of money to these guys
[00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:28.900]   and then turn around and sell it to the highest bidder.
[00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:30.420]   - One comment that's worth making
[00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:34.300]   on the whole virtualization focus there,
[00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:39.260]   it's sort of a red herring to think about these
[00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:42.860]   as just virtual box and VMware as applications
[00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:44.020]   that run on a machine.
[00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:46.420]   The real thing that they're looking for
[00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:49.940]   is the hypervisor that is increasingly a part
[00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:51.580]   of the security infrastructure
[00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:53.620]   of any modern computing device.
[00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:56.740]   The idea is that the hypervisor is the sort of
[00:27:56.740 --> 00:28:00.660]   very low layer of computing that isolates
[00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:04.580]   the process that's supposed to be secure
[00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:07.500]   from your regular desktop processes that you're using.
[00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:11.060]   So the hypervisor is a really core part
[00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:12.660]   of modern security design.
[00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:17.100]   And so targeting those is a really effective way
[00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:21.660]   of finding the most serious security flaws.
[00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:24.420]   - And hypervisor is built into all windows, right?
[00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:25.620]   I mean, this is--
[00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:27.820]   - Into Windows 10 now, yes.
[00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:28.820]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:32.380]   - Yeah, it's a part of features like,
[00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:34.780]   with the new version of Windows that's coming out
[00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:36.300]   in the next few weeks, there's a new feature
[00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:40.420]   called Windows Sandbox that is based on the hypervisor.
[00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:45.420]   There's an edge application guard feature
[00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:51.380]   that allows you to run a completely secure browser session
[00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:54.580]   that is managed by the hypervisor.
[00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:57.180]   And so it should be completely isolated
[00:28:57.180 --> 00:28:59.580]   from the rest of your computing environment.
[00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:03.220]   And there's even new application guard extensions
[00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:06.300]   for Chrome and Firefox, I recall reading,
[00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:07.580]   I haven't been able to test those.
[00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:08.420]   - Yeah, that's right.
[00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:11.420]   - Yeah, on that edge technology,
[00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:13.420]   it doesn't take away the need for a VPN
[00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:15.260]   in terms of somebody in the middle
[00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:17.860]   acts the thing what you're typing does it.
[00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:20.500]   - No, no, no, no, this is a completely separate thing.
[00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:24.300]   This is basically a way to run an isolated browser session
[00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:29.100]   so that, for example, if one of the browser exploits
[00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:32.340]   that they came up with here, if they were able to attack,
[00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:35.140]   if you opened that malicious website
[00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:38.140]   in this secure browser,
[00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:41.260]   it wouldn't be able to jump into your system
[00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:43.380]   because it's protected by the hypervisor.
[00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:44.460]   - Right, at least it should be,
[00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:46.460]   except for the out of bounds exploit.
[00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:47.300]   - Well. - Which allows you
[00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:48.780]   to execute outside of the memory
[00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:49.780]   that particular virtual machine was able to play.
[00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:51.700]   - That brings us to day two of Pondo
[00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:54.460]   and Arthur Kirkus of Exodus Intelligence
[00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:56.220]   targeting Microsoft Edge,
[00:29:56.220 --> 00:29:58.020]   used a double free bug in the renderer
[00:29:58.020 --> 00:30:02.140]   followed by a logic bug to bypass the sandbox.
[00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:04.900]   And that got him $50,000.
[00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:07.700]   So, of course, the good news is that'll be fixed.
[00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:09.180]   - That's a different sandbox.
[00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:10.380]   That's not the same-- - Oh, okay, right.
[00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:11.220]   - That's the Edge sandbox.
[00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:13.980]   - That's not the Windows sandbox feature
[00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:15.580]   that hasn't been released yet.
[00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:20.660]   That's the browser sandbox that's a part of every modern browser
[00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:25.900]   that prevents a low integrity process
[00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:28.860]   from jumping to a high integrity process.
[00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:32.020]   You're basically, nothing is supposed to be able
[00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:35.460]   to get out of the browser and into the file system
[00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:36.980]   or memory or whatever.
[00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:38.900]   But that's a browser design thing
[00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:41.740]   and something different from what I was just talking about.
[00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:42.580]   - Got it.
[00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:44.060]   - Now, you see, I love these events
[00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:45.980]   because I'd love to see-- - I wanna go.
[00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:47.860]   I think they need to stream these on Twitch.
[00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:49.860]   - Absolutely. - This is fun.
[00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:51.140]   - But there's a problem. - Uh-oh.
[00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:53.300]   - And the problem is that while these are fascinating
[00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:55.180]   to see researchers at the top of their game
[00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:56.980]   do things with security features
[00:30:56.980 --> 00:30:58.740]   that we never thought they could,
[00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:00.980]   that's not where the biggest threat's coming from.
[00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:02.500]   The biggest threat on the edge of the internet
[00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:05.740]   are embedded devices, none of which will ever be patched.
[00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:08.780]   And I say that knowing that some will obviously,
[00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:11.980]   but you've got eight incredible tens,
[00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:14.580]   hundreds of millions of devices that are currently on the internet
[00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:15.620]   that are running old firmware
[00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:17.460]   that we have known exploits for
[00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:19.020]   and they will never ever be patched.
[00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:22.060]   And as an attacker, that's where I would be focusing.
[00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:24.580]   I don't need a zero-day bug
[00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:26.460]   in order to cause damage on the internet.
[00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:28.180]   I just need 10 million webcams
[00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:30.620]   that have never changed from their default credentials.
[00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:33.380]   - In the last PONO in Tokyo in November,
[00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:35.660]   they did an IoT PONO.
[00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:37.700]   So they are trying to address this.
[00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:40.820]   The problem is there are millions of IoT devices
[00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:42.900]   by thousands of manufacturers.
[00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:45.100]   - And some of which no longer exist,
[00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:47.140]   but those devices will still be powered on,
[00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:49.100]   they will still be connected and they will still get on.
[00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:51.500]   - So they, in Tokyo, did the Apple watch,
[00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:54.340]   the Amazon Echo, the Google Home, the Nest IQ,
[00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:56.420]   and the Amazon Cloud Cam.
[00:31:56.420 --> 00:31:58.860]   But that's a fraction, I mean, those are all big best sellers,
[00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:01.660]   but that's a fraction of the total IoT out there.
[00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:03.660]   And frankly, the real problem is
[00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:08.340]   these no-name white box Chinese manufactured IoT devices
[00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:10.620]   that are proliferating in every home.
[00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:13.220]   - I don't need to own your computer if I own your router.
[00:32:13.220 --> 00:32:14.060]   - I get your network, I do that.
[00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:15.420]   - If I can see all the traffic coming in
[00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:17.140]   and out of your network, I don't care
[00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:18.180]   about owning your browser.
[00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:20.300]   - It's easy because my username is admin
[00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:21.380]   and so it's not password.
[00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:22.220]   - Yeah.
[00:32:22.220 --> 00:32:23.660]   - One, two, three, one, two, three, four.
[00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:25.820]   - No, I'm serious, that's in my case.
[00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:26.660]   - That's the default.
[00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:28.460]   - That's the default and a lot of people are changed.
[00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:29.300]   - I did.
[00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:30.140]   - Yeah, okay.
[00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:31.460]   - Unless you have one of those phone cast routers
[00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:33.620]   that have, say, hard-coded credentials
[00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:35.220]   so that they can always get in.
[00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:36.060]   - Oh, that's nice.
[00:32:36.060 --> 00:32:37.700]   - Yeah, that's awesome.
[00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:39.300]   - If I just said all of my passwords,
[00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:41.900]   two, one, two, three, four, five, seven.
[00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:45.020]   - Oh, sneaky.
[00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:46.500]   - Done.
[00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:47.940]   Nobody will ever guess that.
[00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:50.460]   Or just change the A to the @ sign,
[00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:52.060]   nobody ever guesses that.
[00:32:52.060 --> 00:32:54.380]   - Lead speak, it's your friend.
[00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:58.300]   Floral acetate was the team that hacked the Tesla
[00:32:58.300 --> 00:33:01.100]   they used a Justin Time bug in the renderer
[00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:03.820]   to break into the Tesla browser
[00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:05.380]   and display their own message.
[00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:07.180]   Doesn't say what the message was.
[00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:08.420]   I hope it was obscene.
[00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:12.580]   And they get the car, you get a new car.
[00:33:12.580 --> 00:33:15.580]   They, Floral acetate the big winners
[00:33:15.580 --> 00:33:21.460]   of the $545,000 awarded at Ponda on this week.
[00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:24.420]   They got $375,000.
[00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:25.260]   - Good day.
[00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:26.820]   - And they did that, well, I think last time too.
[00:33:26.820 --> 00:33:29.620]   They're really, it's just these two guys,
[00:33:29.620 --> 00:33:32.220]   Richard, Jew and Amat, comma, and they are.
[00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:33.820]   Here's their show the picture.
[00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:36.980]   Let's give them credit with the big Ponda on trophy.
[00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:37.820]   - Good for them.
[00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:39.940]   - That's enough money for them to live another year.
[00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:41.340]   They'll live till the next Ponda.
[00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:42.340]   - That's right.
[00:33:42.340 --> 00:33:43.180]   Live well.
[00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:44.940]   - Nice job. - Where are you from?
[00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:46.100]   - Don't know.
[00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:47.860]   I have to say though, kids,
[00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:52.540]   you want a good job?
[00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:53.780]   With a future?
[00:33:53.780 --> 00:33:55.340]   Learn how to crack.
[00:33:55.340 --> 00:33:56.380]   - Yeah, but that's two.
[00:33:56.380 --> 00:33:57.220]   - That's two guys.
[00:33:57.220 --> 00:33:59.380]   How many people have tried to find them?
[00:33:59.380 --> 00:34:02.260]   - There's a pretty brisk group of people.
[00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:03.660]   What was it, Hacker One?
[00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:05.460]   So there's a number of organizations
[00:34:05.460 --> 00:34:07.380]   that buy these exploits.
[00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:09.780]   Zorodium is one that maybe is a little sketch,
[00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:12.900]   but Hacker One is a little bit more benign
[00:34:12.900 --> 00:34:15.300]   because they end up by pretty sure giving the exploits
[00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:17.740]   to the companies that create the software for fixing.
[00:34:17.740 --> 00:34:22.340]   They had a, they were the ones that publicized this young guy
[00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:23.780]   and kid from Argentina.
[00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:26.140]   It's like 19 years old, first Hacker
[00:34:26.140 --> 00:34:30.620]   to make a million dollars in one year with exploits.
[00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:32.380]   So I think there's money to be made.
[00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:33.900]   You're right, you gotta be good.
[00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:35.500]   - And in general, there's money to be made
[00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:38.620]   at least at the good career in technology security.
[00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:39.860]   I mean, whether you're a Hacker or not,
[00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:42.660]   just security, the whole security industry
[00:34:42.660 --> 00:34:44.180]   is hungry for talented people.
[00:34:44.180 --> 00:34:45.020]   - Absolutely.
[00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:46.980]   - This is a Hacker One is an interesting business
[00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:51.780]   because they are essentially funded by the companies,
[00:34:51.780 --> 00:34:56.780]   not by bad guys, not by autocrats and other nations,
[00:34:56.780 --> 00:34:59.660]   but by the companies.
[00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:02.540]   And it's a place for somebody to go who wants a career.
[00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:05.460]   In fact, they have a whole page for hackers,
[00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:08.580]   a Hacker One that tells you how to start.
[00:35:08.580 --> 00:35:09.940]   Enjoy the thrill of the hunt.
[00:35:09.940 --> 00:35:10.780]   - The hack and stay out of jail.
[00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:11.620]   All three, wow.
[00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:13.780]   - Hack all the things, use your skills
[00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:14.820]   to make us safer internet.
[00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:15.780]   They've got a leaderboard.
[00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:17.140]   Should we see the leaderboard?
[00:35:17.140 --> 00:35:21.660]   Here's the top Hacker One hackers and their earnings.
[00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:24.540]   - Oh, I guess it's not earnings, it's just a reputation.
[00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:27.360]   Today is new, has the highest reputation score.
[00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:29.380]   I think it's pretty cool, right?
[00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:30.940]   This makes it, this is fun.
[00:35:30.940 --> 00:35:34.260]   - The best hackers I know will never be on that board.
[00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:35.700]   - They don't wanna be on that board.
[00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:37.060]   - Yeah, that's the point.
[00:35:37.060 --> 00:35:39.900]   - They don't want somebody knocking at their door.
[00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:41.100]   - Yeah.
[00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:42.700]   - Well, all right.
[00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:45.060]   - Okay, look, there's nothing wrong with getting
[00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:47.060]   the security field, it's a burgeoning field
[00:35:47.060 --> 00:35:48.380]   that will be worth a lot more.
[00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:50.580]   Most of us, the vast majority of us,
[00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:52.060]   and I count myself in this,
[00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:54.180]   are we're just a level above script kitty.
[00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:55.700]   I can use exploits, I understand this.
[00:35:55.700 --> 00:35:57.260]   - You're a pretty adept hacker.
[00:35:57.260 --> 00:35:59.660]   - I'm adept, but there is that level
[00:35:59.660 --> 00:36:01.140]   that's way above me and I will never be.
[00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:04.620]   The people who actually come up with the original exploits
[00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:06.060]   that I will end up using.
[00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:08.820]   - You know how to put together wire shark and map
[00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:13.140]   and do stuff, but there, and I think it's almost
[00:36:13.140 --> 00:36:16.700]   a genetic thing that they just can kind of intuit
[00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:21.500]   where to look, people like the Google Zero Day Guy,
[00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:22.860]   Travis--
[00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:23.700]   - Tavis Ormondy.
[00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:28.700]   - Ormondy, Tavis, who is like, he said,
[00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:32.340]   I was in the shower and I was thinking about it
[00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:33.860]   and I said, "Wait a minute."
[00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:35.740]   And he found him, I can't remember what the bug was,
[00:36:35.740 --> 00:36:38.140]   but it's like Tavis's shower thoughts.
[00:36:38.140 --> 00:36:41.500]   I think there is a certain skill set that's fascinating
[00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:43.140]   that some of these people have.
[00:36:44.180 --> 00:36:47.180]   - Well, and I think the difference between people
[00:36:47.180 --> 00:36:51.180]   who are good at something and people who are great at it
[00:36:51.180 --> 00:36:55.180]   is the difference between a scratch golfer and a pro.
[00:36:55.180 --> 00:36:56.020]   - Yeah.
[00:36:56.020 --> 00:37:00.340]   - And there's a lot of scratch golfers in the world.
[00:37:00.340 --> 00:37:01.180]   - Yeah, yep.
[00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:07.180]   - But, and yet you watch them try and turn pro and--
[00:37:07.180 --> 00:37:08.100]   - It's not easy.
[00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:08.940]   - Right.
[00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:09.780]   - It's not easy.
[00:37:09.780 --> 00:37:12.900]   - Here's the Tavis tweet from 2017.
[00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:15.820]   "Aha, I had an epiphany in the shower this morning
[00:37:15.820 --> 00:37:20.020]   and realized how to get code exec on last pass 4.1.43.
[00:37:20.020 --> 00:37:23.340]   You know, if you're thinking of this stuff in the shower
[00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:27.060]   and going, "Oh, you might be better than a scratch golfer."
[00:37:27.060 --> 00:37:28.340]   - Last week I had an epiphany in the shower.
[00:37:28.340 --> 00:37:30.620]   I was like, "I think we have hot eggs this morning."
[00:37:30.620 --> 00:37:32.780]   (laughing)
[00:37:32.780 --> 00:37:36.020]   - Honestly, I know why you have epiphanies in the shower.
[00:37:36.020 --> 00:37:38.020]   It's the hot water, it's open, it's dilating the vessels.
[00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:39.940]   - We don't have hot water in the Vatican, so--
[00:37:39.940 --> 00:37:40.780]   - What?
[00:37:40.780 --> 00:37:42.980]   - You have to take cold showers?
[00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:43.900]   - It's better that way.
[00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:44.900]   - It's going too far.
[00:37:44.900 --> 00:37:49.420]   Here's the picture of the floral acetate
[00:37:49.420 --> 00:37:51.180]   winnings in the trunk of the Tesla.
[00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:52.020]   - Look at that.
[00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:52.860]   - As they drove off.
[00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:55.540]   Look at those, they got three laptops, a trophy.
[00:37:55.540 --> 00:37:56.380]   - That's amazing.
[00:37:56.380 --> 00:37:57.220]   - That's amazing.
[00:37:57.220 --> 00:37:58.980]   - I didn't realize that Tesla had that much trunk space.
[00:37:58.980 --> 00:38:00.780]   - It's a great truck, man.
[00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:02.580]   The red paint cost $2,500.
[00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:03.420]   - What?
[00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:04.740]   - Yeah, you paint what is it?
[00:38:04.740 --> 00:38:05.580]   - Wait, what?
[00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:06.980]   - That's true.
[00:38:06.980 --> 00:38:08.860]   - We Tesla owners sucklers.
[00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:09.700]   - That's for sure.
[00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:13.380]   - Did you pay the extra $5,000 for the red brake calipers?
[00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:14.220]   - I did.
[00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:15.060]   - No, did you?
[00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:15.900]   - Yeah.
[00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:16.740]   - The calipers?
[00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:17.740]   - I loaded it.
[00:38:17.740 --> 00:38:19.020]   - Powder-coated, baby.
[00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:19.860]   - I figured--
[00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:20.700]   - I'm on love for you.
[00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:22.700]   - Gotta keep that resale value up.
[00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:25.260]   Well, let's see, we were talking about this before the show,
[00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:26.660]   'cause you bought recently, but I'm on--
[00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:28.020]   - Well, I bought it in December
[00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:29.740]   before it went down by $6,000.
[00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:30.780]   - You kinda got screwed.
[00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:31.620]   - Kinda.
[00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:33.580]   - I knew when I was buying my Tesla three years ago,
[00:38:33.580 --> 00:38:34.740]   the Model X had just come out there.
[00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:36.220]   I was really subsidizing Tesla.
[00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:37.060]   - Right, you were--
[00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:37.900]   - Tesla.
[00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:39.660]   - And I knew that, you know, he made up stuff
[00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:44.660]   like the air filtration system is bio--
[00:38:44.660 --> 00:38:46.220]   can handle biohazards, right?
[00:38:46.220 --> 00:38:48.100]   - It could save you from anthrax.
[00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:49.860]   - It has that biohazard symbol on it.
[00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:51.940]   That was like a few thousand dollars extra.
[00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:54.860]   I know that was BS that I was never gonna drive
[00:38:54.860 --> 00:38:57.020]   through a biohazard.
[00:38:57.020 --> 00:38:58.380]   - But you could have Leo.
[00:38:58.380 --> 00:39:00.420]   - I wanted to support Elon.
[00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:02.940]   And I thought, well, this guy is a pretty good marketer.
[00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:04.780]   Now I'm having second thoughts, but it's our--
[00:39:04.780 --> 00:39:07.940]   - Yeah, you can, don't get me started on my,
[00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:10.220]   I love the product, I love the car.
[00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:12.060]   The company is no worse than faking
[00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:13.900]   your diesel engine emissions results.
[00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:15.300]   - That sounds a lot better than that.
[00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:16.300]   - No, look, they're great cars.
[00:39:16.300 --> 00:39:18.620]   And I gave Elon a lot of credit for making
[00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:19.780]   electric cars cool.
[00:39:19.780 --> 00:39:20.900]   I mean, he definitely did that.
[00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:22.500]   They used to be pretty boring.
[00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:23.340]   - Let's take a little break.
[00:39:23.340 --> 00:39:25.420]   When we come back, we'll talk about Apple's event
[00:39:25.420 --> 00:39:27.180]   coming up tomorrow, what we can expect.
[00:39:27.180 --> 00:39:28.860]   EdBot is here.
[00:39:28.860 --> 00:39:32.820]   He is the king of everything tech,
[00:39:32.820 --> 00:39:34.260]   but I think especially, I always think of you
[00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:37.300]   as the expert on Windows, the EdBot reported ZDNet.
[00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:39.100]   - Thank you.
[00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:40.620]   - Thank you for being here.
[00:39:40.620 --> 00:39:42.940]   We also love having Larry Maggeton.
[00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:45.300]   He is at CBS News Radio, where he helps
[00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:47.380]   normals understand technology.
[00:39:47.380 --> 00:39:48.220]   - Yep.
[00:39:48.220 --> 00:39:49.060]   - Not an easy task.
[00:39:49.060 --> 00:39:50.820]   - 6 a.m. tomorrow morning, I'll be on the air
[00:39:50.820 --> 00:39:51.660]   trying to explain how.
[00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:52.780]   - You don't do that live, do you?
[00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:53.620]   - Yeah.
[00:39:53.620 --> 00:39:55.140]   Well, some of it's stuff I do, it depends on what it is.
[00:39:55.140 --> 00:39:56.460]   - What are you gonna talk about 6 a.m. tomorrow?
[00:39:56.460 --> 00:39:57.940]   - Well, two ways with stations.
[00:39:57.940 --> 00:39:59.620]   They'll call me up and they'll ask you.
[00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:00.460]   - Do they ask you?
[00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:01.300]   - Yeah, they call me up.
[00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:02.860]   - Larry, what are we gonna see at this Apple event?
[00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:03.860]   - Exactly.
[00:40:03.860 --> 00:40:05.340]   And I say, I don't know.
[00:40:05.340 --> 00:40:07.940]   - I said no. Every time they always wanna know that.
[00:40:07.940 --> 00:40:09.980]   They always have to say the same thing like,
[00:40:09.980 --> 00:40:12.380]   well, Apple doesn't say no one really knows,
[00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:13.740]   but let me tell you what the rumors are.
[00:40:13.740 --> 00:40:15.220]   - It's kind of like talking about the Mueller report
[00:40:15.220 --> 00:40:16.060]   until today, right?
[00:40:16.060 --> 00:40:16.900]   - Right.
[00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:17.740]   - It's all speculation.
[00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:18.580]   - Exactly.
[00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:19.420]   - It never stops anybody.
[00:40:19.420 --> 00:40:22.620]   - Apple leaks are better than Mueller leaks.
[00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:23.460]   Apple does leak.
[00:40:23.460 --> 00:40:24.860]   - I think there's a lot more interest.
[00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:25.700]   - Yeah.
[00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:26.540]   - That too.
[00:40:26.540 --> 00:40:27.380]   - Sadly.
[00:40:27.380 --> 00:40:29.540]   Also here, Mr. Father.
[00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:30.380]   - Mr. Father.
[00:40:30.380 --> 00:40:31.220]   - Mr. Father.
[00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:32.420]   - The Reverend Wright Revan Father.
[00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:35.980]   Everybody loves Padre S.J. Father Robert Palace.
[00:40:35.980 --> 00:40:37.540]   They're the digital Jesuit.
[00:40:37.540 --> 00:40:39.980]   He is a on leave.
[00:40:39.980 --> 00:40:40.820]   You're not on leave.
[00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:42.740]   You're always on duty.
[00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:43.580]   - Yeah.
[00:40:43.580 --> 00:40:44.420]   - Do you carry?
[00:40:44.420 --> 00:40:46.340]   I'm just wondering, 'cause I know in the movies,
[00:40:46.340 --> 00:40:47.300]   the priest, when he always,
[00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:49.020]   he comes running in with the last rights,
[00:40:49.020 --> 00:40:50.500]   the last rice kits.
[00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:52.460]   Do you carry a last rights kit with you?
[00:40:52.460 --> 00:40:53.300]   - I do not.
[00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:54.540]   - You can't give me the last function,
[00:40:54.540 --> 00:40:55.780]   the final function if I--
[00:40:55.780 --> 00:40:58.140]   - I could, but I would find stuff like you.
[00:40:58.140 --> 00:40:59.980]   - Like oil to anoint me and stuff like that.
[00:40:59.980 --> 00:41:01.740]   You just get some olive oil from the kitchen.
[00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:03.340]   - I always carry a spare battery.
[00:41:03.340 --> 00:41:04.940]   I always carry a spare power cable.
[00:41:04.940 --> 00:41:06.740]   I do not carry a stack of metal kits.
[00:41:06.740 --> 00:41:08.100]   - Different last rights, different form of,
[00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:08.940]   I'm just curious.
[00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:09.780]   You see, you learn.
[00:41:09.780 --> 00:41:12.660]   - You hear a last rights app you could use?
[00:41:12.660 --> 00:41:15.260]   - Yes, anything on Apple.
[00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:16.340]   - Wait a minute, you did tell us though
[00:41:16.340 --> 00:41:18.700]   that there is an app that you guys have.
[00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:19.820]   - Yes, click to pray.
[00:41:19.820 --> 00:41:20.660]   - Click to pray.
[00:41:20.660 --> 00:41:23.100]   - But it's not click to give last rights.
[00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:24.220]   - What is click to pray?
[00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:27.420]   - Click to pray, they actually made the national news
[00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:29.500]   or international news a while back.
[00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:31.300]   - This isn't the Pokemon go thing.
[00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:33.700]   - Oh no, I had nothing to do with that.
[00:41:33.700 --> 00:41:35.980]   I had absolutely nothing to do with that.
[00:41:35.980 --> 00:41:39.420]   - No, this, the Pope actually signed up for it
[00:41:39.420 --> 00:41:42.100]   about a month ago and our usership shot up
[00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:44.780]   from a few thousand a day to several times.
[00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:47.140]   - So you can ask the Pope to pray for you?
[00:41:47.140 --> 00:41:48.140]   - Kind of, yeah.
[00:41:48.140 --> 00:41:48.980]   - Wow.
[00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:50.020]   - You know, Tesla could be a last right
[00:41:50.020 --> 00:41:51.980]   to do the screen just before the car is about
[00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:53.340]   to crash on autopilot.
[00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:55.260]   (laughing)
[00:41:55.260 --> 00:41:58.660]   - If that pops up on screen, you're in trouble.
[00:41:58.660 --> 00:42:02.380]   - So if you click to pray, you click and you get a prayer?
[00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:05.380]   - Well, it's sort of, okay, so people who just want
[00:42:05.380 --> 00:42:07.300]   meditation time, it can like bring you
[00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:08.660]   through a quick five minute meditation.
[00:42:08.660 --> 00:42:10.620]   - So this is like calm.com for Catholics.
[00:42:10.620 --> 00:42:12.340]   - It's like, that's nice.
[00:42:12.340 --> 00:42:13.940]   It's nothing groundbreaking.
[00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:16.540]   The big thing was that Pope Francis signed up
[00:42:16.540 --> 00:42:18.340]   for an account, so now you could actually ask
[00:42:18.340 --> 00:42:19.180]   Pope Francis to pray for you.
[00:42:19.180 --> 00:42:20.740]   - Can you be my friend online?
[00:42:20.740 --> 00:42:22.220]   - I think you can do that, yeah.
[00:42:22.220 --> 00:42:23.580]   - Yeah, if I could open the Pope's,
[00:42:23.580 --> 00:42:25.740]   this is the Pope's prayer profile.
[00:42:25.740 --> 00:42:30.020]   And you could get his prayers and you could pray along.
[00:42:30.020 --> 00:42:32.940]   - Wow, and then he enters all of that in personally.
[00:42:32.940 --> 00:42:33.780]   - Really, he actually--
[00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:34.620]   - No, he does, isn't.
[00:42:34.620 --> 00:42:35.460]   - You type it.
[00:42:35.460 --> 00:42:36.660]   - Does he dictate it, and you type it?
[00:42:36.660 --> 00:42:37.980]   Is that how it works?
[00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:39.980]   - There's several widgets.
[00:42:39.980 --> 00:42:40.820]   - He's never gonna say.
[00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:43.500]   - That work in the background to make that happen.
[00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:44.380]   - Let me just put it this way,
[00:42:44.380 --> 00:42:45.820]   there's the secrecy of the Vatican,
[00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:46.820]   much better than an app.
[00:42:46.820 --> 00:42:47.900]   - Yeah, good security.
[00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:49.820]   - Yes, actually it's really, really good.
[00:42:49.820 --> 00:42:52.100]   Have you seen my box of meat?
[00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:55.420]   I'm afraid to ask what that is.
[00:42:55.420 --> 00:42:58.140]   It's literally a box of meat.
[00:42:58.140 --> 00:43:00.380]   - Is it refrigerating?
[00:43:00.380 --> 00:43:02.580]   - It is, this is my butcher box.
[00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:04.220]   I don't know if there's actually any meat in here,
[00:43:04.220 --> 00:43:05.380]   I think we took it all home.
[00:43:05.380 --> 00:43:06.300]   - It's like Rachel Ray,
[00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:07.980]   with the audience gets to eat it.
[00:43:07.980 --> 00:43:10.580]   - You get a pork chop, and you get a pork chop,
[00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:12.420]   and you and you and you.
[00:43:12.420 --> 00:43:14.780]   When this came, I got three of them.
[00:43:14.780 --> 00:43:17.100]   There was pandemonium in the office.
[00:43:17.100 --> 00:43:18.900]   My son came running down the hall and said,
[00:43:18.900 --> 00:43:21.900]   you just got three giant boxes of meat.
[00:43:21.900 --> 00:43:24.420]   Butcher box, I love butcher box,
[00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:26.180]   I did some sirloin tips the other day.
[00:43:26.180 --> 00:43:27.900]   What a stew this made.
[00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:30.500]   Butcher box is better meat for you.
[00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:32.740]   It's meat free from antibiotics and hormones,
[00:43:32.740 --> 00:43:36.060]   humanely raised, quality beef, chicken,
[00:43:36.060 --> 00:43:38.500]   and pork delivered right to your door.
[00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:41.620]   You can choose from curated boxes,
[00:43:41.620 --> 00:43:43.820]   including a mix of high quality beef, chicken, and pork,
[00:43:43.820 --> 00:43:45.180]   or customize your own box.
[00:43:45.180 --> 00:43:48.620]   If you know, we do a Tuesday taco night,
[00:43:48.620 --> 00:43:49.700]   taco Tuesday, right?
[00:43:49.700 --> 00:43:52.500]   And we always use the ground beef from our butcher box.
[00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:56.220]   It is, if I serve something different,
[00:43:56.220 --> 00:43:57.180]   everybody would know.
[00:43:57.180 --> 00:43:59.540]   It's grass fed, grass finished.
[00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:00.380]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:44:00.380 --> 00:44:02.900]   And so the meat, I don't know if you've ever had
[00:44:02.900 --> 00:44:07.020]   a grass finished meat, but it's what meat used to taste like
[00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:08.460]   before factory farming.
[00:44:08.460 --> 00:44:10.540]   To me it is frozen at the peak of freshness,
[00:44:10.540 --> 00:44:12.660]   so it comes to you frozen in an individual,
[00:44:12.660 --> 00:44:14.620]   vacuum packed biodegradable packaging.
[00:44:14.620 --> 00:44:17.700]   I really like how responsible they are with the packaging.
[00:44:17.700 --> 00:44:19.980]   Each box is shipped to the carefully calculated amount
[00:44:19.980 --> 00:44:21.540]   of dry ice, so it will be,
[00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:23.140]   and we had a lot of fun with the dry ice
[00:44:23.140 --> 00:44:24.700]   when it came, by the way.
[00:44:24.700 --> 00:44:27.500]   So it'll be frozen, and it was, it was frozen, solid.
[00:44:27.500 --> 00:44:28.460]   There was no question about that
[00:44:28.460 --> 00:44:30.220]   after it reaches your doorstep.
[00:44:30.220 --> 00:44:31.260]   Of course, if there's any problem,
[00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:34.460]   you can immediately call butcher box and they'll trade for you.
[00:44:34.460 --> 00:44:36.780]   Grass fed, grass finished beef,
[00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:38.940]   free range organic chicken,
[00:44:38.940 --> 00:44:42.060]   the pork, I kind of also sing its praises,
[00:44:42.060 --> 00:44:44.780]   'cause I make a, a Friday night,
[00:44:44.780 --> 00:44:46.820]   is a pork night at the La Porte household.
[00:44:46.820 --> 00:44:49.460]   I usually will make a, a kind of,
[00:44:49.460 --> 00:44:50.980]   I call 'em, 'cause the kid won't eat it
[00:44:50.980 --> 00:44:52.580]   unless I call it a venier schnitzel,
[00:44:52.580 --> 00:44:54.060]   but I pound out the pork,
[00:44:54.060 --> 00:44:56.340]   I bread it and fry it, and it's delicious,
[00:44:56.340 --> 00:44:59.140]   and it's so much better with a pork from butcher box,
[00:44:59.140 --> 00:45:01.540]   'cause again, it's heritage bread pork,
[00:45:01.540 --> 00:45:03.660]   so it's like meat used to taste.
[00:45:03.660 --> 00:45:05.500]   Butcher box believes in a healthier food system
[00:45:05.500 --> 00:45:07.060]   where everyone has access to meat,
[00:45:07.060 --> 00:45:08.620]   the way nature intended.
[00:45:08.620 --> 00:45:12.580]   No antibiotics, no hormones, humanely raised.
[00:45:12.580 --> 00:45:13.980]   You'll cook with peace of mind
[00:45:13.980 --> 00:45:16.740]   knowing you're eating healthy, high quality meat,
[00:45:16.740 --> 00:45:18.940]   and look at that bacon.
[00:45:18.940 --> 00:45:20.340]   You had me at bacon.
[00:45:20.980 --> 00:45:21.980]   (laughs)
[00:45:21.980 --> 00:45:25.020]   Ah, build your own box, choose exactly how much you want
[00:45:25.020 --> 00:45:27.860]   for the things you love, or let them curate it
[00:45:27.860 --> 00:45:29.620]   so you get something new every time.
[00:45:29.620 --> 00:45:31.660]   Choose your delivery frequency,
[00:45:31.660 --> 00:45:33.700]   and of course there's always recipe cards inside
[00:45:33.700 --> 00:45:36.620]   to help you cook quality meals, lots of tips.
[00:45:36.620 --> 00:45:39.180]   We're gonna get you $20 off your first box.
[00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:41.340]   My mouth is watering.
[00:45:41.340 --> 00:45:43.700]   And two pounds of ground beef a month
[00:45:43.700 --> 00:45:44.940]   for the life of your membership.
[00:45:44.940 --> 00:45:47.660]   Taco Tuesday never had it so good.
[00:45:47.660 --> 00:45:50.260]   For free, 20, let me say that again,
[00:45:50.260 --> 00:45:51.980]   'cause that is a great offer.
[00:45:51.980 --> 00:45:54.220]   $20 off your first box plus,
[00:45:54.220 --> 00:45:57.700]   free two pounds of ground beef every month forever.
[00:45:57.700 --> 00:46:00.060]   For as long as your membership is active,
[00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:02.060]   go to butcherbox.com/twit
[00:46:02.060 --> 00:46:03.940]   and hit Twitter, check out for your extra
[00:46:03.940 --> 00:46:06.260]   two pounds of ground beef.
[00:46:06.260 --> 00:46:10.500]   And $20 off your first box, butcher box.
[00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:11.540]   - Yeah, I'm doing it right now.
[00:46:11.540 --> 00:46:12.820]   - It is so good.
[00:46:12.820 --> 00:46:15.020]   Go to butcherbox.com/twit
[00:46:15.020 --> 00:46:16.940]   and hit it Twitter, at checkout.
[00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:19.060]   Larry, you come back and you tell me.
[00:46:19.060 --> 00:46:21.100]   - You know, the presumption is,
[00:46:21.100 --> 00:46:22.020]   and I think this is true,
[00:46:22.020 --> 00:46:27.020]   that the new luxury for a lot of people
[00:46:27.020 --> 00:46:30.420]   isn't a fancy car or gold jewelry.
[00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:33.460]   It's good food, good wine, good experiences.
[00:46:33.460 --> 00:46:36.980]   I think we've really changed how we think of,
[00:46:36.980 --> 00:46:39.700]   if you have some discretionary funds,
[00:46:39.700 --> 00:46:43.140]   you don't spend it on Rolex anymore, right?
[00:46:43.140 --> 00:46:44.740]   And I think that these companies
[00:46:44.740 --> 00:46:46.420]   are coming along saying people don't want to go
[00:46:46.420 --> 00:46:48.740]   to Applebox anymore, not Applebox.
[00:46:48.740 --> 00:46:49.940]   - Applebeas anymore.
[00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:51.340]   (laughing)
[00:46:51.340 --> 00:46:53.500]   - I thought you'd be Applebee, what?
[00:46:53.500 --> 00:46:54.700]   - Applebee's.
[00:46:54.700 --> 00:46:58.060]   No, Applebee's, okay, nothing against Applebee's,
[00:46:58.060 --> 00:47:00.900]   but everything you get there is frozen
[00:47:00.900 --> 00:47:03.060]   and then microwaved and then put on your plate
[00:47:03.060 --> 00:47:04.340]   and serve to you.
[00:47:04.340 --> 00:47:07.260]   You might as well just stay home and do it yourself.
[00:47:07.260 --> 00:47:08.460]   And people are realizing that,
[00:47:08.460 --> 00:47:10.220]   and I think they're liking cooking again.
[00:47:10.220 --> 00:47:11.940]   - Yeah, well that's what I was thinking about.
[00:47:11.940 --> 00:47:13.940]   I actually like cooking and my wife is pretty good at it.
[00:47:13.940 --> 00:47:14.780]   - Well that's what these boxes do,
[00:47:14.780 --> 00:47:17.220]   is that instead of having a meal plan and shop,
[00:47:17.220 --> 00:47:19.420]   'cause we are busy, you say,
[00:47:19.420 --> 00:47:21.700]   "I wanna make that, that, that today."
[00:47:21.700 --> 00:47:23.340]   And then you get the box.
[00:47:23.340 --> 00:47:25.660]   I do agree that there's issues,
[00:47:25.660 --> 00:47:27.380]   and I think the biggest issue is a competitive issue,
[00:47:27.380 --> 00:47:29.620]   'cause you know Whole Food is well aware
[00:47:29.620 --> 00:47:32.460]   of Butcherbox and HelloFresh.
[00:47:32.460 --> 00:47:33.380]   - Yeah, I wish I could go--
[00:47:33.380 --> 00:47:34.220]   - I wish I could go-- - I wish I could go
[00:47:34.220 --> 00:47:35.700]   and buying it off the steam table.
[00:47:35.700 --> 00:47:38.500]   - Yeah, Port Robert has to eat bad spaghetti every day.
[00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:40.820]   - Well because there's a, it's actually a law.
[00:47:40.820 --> 00:47:44.140]   So if you have a house that's of a certain size
[00:47:44.140 --> 00:47:46.380]   of people who are not related by blood,
[00:47:46.380 --> 00:47:48.380]   you actually have to have an institutional kitchen.
[00:47:48.380 --> 00:47:50.460]   So I'm not allowed to go into the kitchen.
[00:47:50.460 --> 00:47:51.820]   - Oh, I feel so bad for you.
[00:47:51.820 --> 00:47:53.300]   - And you know, we're in the middle of Rome,
[00:47:53.300 --> 00:47:55.460]   but all we get every day is--
[00:47:55.460 --> 00:47:56.860]   (laughing)
[00:47:56.860 --> 00:47:58.500]   - Is it at least al dente?
[00:47:58.500 --> 00:48:01.100]   It's all al dente until they resurve it for dinner
[00:48:01.100 --> 00:48:02.500]   and then it's soaked up everything else.
[00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:03.940]   - Oh! - It's mushy, so.
[00:48:03.940 --> 00:48:06.940]   - We'll take up a collection for you.
[00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:08.860]   - To me, the greatest thing in the world,
[00:48:08.860 --> 00:48:09.980]   and I do it almost every day,
[00:48:09.980 --> 00:48:13.220]   is we have a big green egg, which is a komado of--
[00:48:13.220 --> 00:48:14.060]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:48:14.060 --> 00:48:15.060]   - And it's thick ceramic.
[00:48:15.060 --> 00:48:18.500]   I fire that up every day, I pull out a nice kind of meat,
[00:48:18.500 --> 00:48:20.260]   and I often will sous vide it.
[00:48:20.260 --> 00:48:21.740]   In fact, that's the nice thing about the butcher box,
[00:48:21.740 --> 00:48:23.380]   it's frozen, but I pull it out,
[00:48:23.380 --> 00:48:24.740]   I sous vide it the night before,
[00:48:24.740 --> 00:48:26.700]   it's ready to go, throw it on the grill,
[00:48:26.700 --> 00:48:28.380]   it's ready in five minutes, and there is,
[00:48:28.380 --> 00:48:31.020]   I mean, honestly, there's no restaurant that could be.
[00:48:31.020 --> 00:48:33.820]   - We have a electronic key lock system
[00:48:33.820 --> 00:48:35.180]   at the Vatican at the Korea.
[00:48:35.180 --> 00:48:36.020]   - So keep you in?
[00:48:36.020 --> 00:48:38.140]   - Well, no, so that you can get into the different parts
[00:48:38.140 --> 00:48:39.420]   that you're supposed to get into,
[00:48:39.420 --> 00:48:41.740]   and I hacked that in the first week.
[00:48:41.740 --> 00:48:43.300]   (laughing)
[00:48:43.300 --> 00:48:44.300]   Super secure!
[00:48:44.300 --> 00:48:46.700]   - But now I can get down into the apartments
[00:48:46.700 --> 00:48:48.620]   that we reserved for visiting lay people,
[00:48:48.620 --> 00:48:50.220]   and a few of them have kitchens.
[00:48:50.220 --> 00:48:51.060]   - You go down there and--
[00:48:51.060 --> 00:48:51.900]   - So I go down there, but I have to be--
[00:48:51.900 --> 00:48:52.740]   - Don't say that quiet.
[00:48:52.740 --> 00:48:54.500]   - You know you're on TV right now.
[00:48:54.500 --> 00:48:56.940]   - So tell me about the wall around the Vatican.
[00:48:56.940 --> 00:48:59.100]   - Yeah, people always go, don't you have a wall?
[00:48:59.100 --> 00:49:01.300]   No, we have pieces of walls.
[00:49:01.300 --> 00:49:03.020]   And they're very nice, and then they follow
[00:49:03.020 --> 00:49:04.380]   in people every once in a while.
[00:49:04.380 --> 00:49:05.900]   - But I remember the last time I went there,
[00:49:05.900 --> 00:49:07.460]   there was nobody keeping me out.
[00:49:07.460 --> 00:49:10.940]   - No, no, I mean, the Swiss guarder there.
[00:49:10.940 --> 00:49:11.940]   - You met the Pope, right, Larry?
[00:49:11.940 --> 00:49:13.460]   - I didn't meet the Pope, you didn't find a picture
[00:49:13.460 --> 00:49:14.580]   of me in the Pope.
[00:49:14.580 --> 00:49:16.420]   Actually, Microsoft just met with the Pope.
[00:49:16.420 --> 00:49:18.500]   They had one of their representatives
[00:49:18.500 --> 00:49:20.420]   come over about a month ago.
[00:49:20.420 --> 00:49:23.380]   So it's becoming a place.
[00:49:23.380 --> 00:49:28.140]   - New York Times, a germane, a pro-poir conversation.
[00:49:28.140 --> 00:49:31.220]   Today and the Sunday Times, human contact is now--
[00:49:31.220 --> 00:49:32.780]   - A luxury good.
[00:49:32.780 --> 00:49:37.420]   - Screens used to be for the elite now avoiding them.
[00:49:37.420 --> 00:49:39.420]   Is a status symbol, it was only a matter of time
[00:49:39.420 --> 00:49:41.700]   in the Great Nelly Bowls on this one.
[00:49:41.700 --> 00:49:46.700]   People are relishing face-to-face contact.
[00:49:46.700 --> 00:49:47.900]   - What a concept.
[00:49:47.900 --> 00:49:49.220]   - I kind of knew this was coming.
[00:49:49.220 --> 00:49:51.220]   I really felt it's been coming for some time,
[00:49:51.220 --> 00:49:53.380]   that we were getting burned out on social media,
[00:49:53.380 --> 00:49:57.100]   that turned out, social media was anything but social.
[00:49:57.100 --> 00:49:58.300]   It was really anti-social.
[00:49:58.300 --> 00:50:00.500]   And I've never felt, in August I killed my Facebook,
[00:50:00.500 --> 00:50:02.580]   Twitter, Instagram, and Tumblr accounts.
[00:50:02.580 --> 00:50:04.140]   And it was the greatest thing I've ever done.
[00:50:04.140 --> 00:50:05.780]   Not that I actually go out and meet people,
[00:50:05.780 --> 00:50:06.900]   I just stay home.
[00:50:06.900 --> 00:50:11.180]   But honestly, I think I was feeling ill
[00:50:11.180 --> 00:50:14.820]   from social media, that our friend Trey Reklef
[00:50:14.820 --> 00:50:17.420]   has just written a new book about the malign influence
[00:50:17.420 --> 00:50:20.780]   of social influencers on Instagram.
[00:50:20.780 --> 00:50:22.540]   When Instagram first came out, Trey,
[00:50:22.540 --> 00:50:24.100]   who was a great photographer, said,
[00:50:24.100 --> 00:50:26.140]   "This is changing, it's like all of us."
[00:50:26.140 --> 00:50:29.740]   We get these very optimistic looks
[00:50:29.740 --> 00:50:31.020]   at what we think is happening,
[00:50:31.020 --> 00:50:32.700]   and then the truth sets in.
[00:50:32.700 --> 00:50:35.860]   He thought Instagram was gonna change people's vocabulary,
[00:50:35.860 --> 00:50:37.260]   that the generation was gonna grow up
[00:50:37.260 --> 00:50:41.020]   with a visual vocabulary instead of a verbal vocabulary.
[00:50:41.020 --> 00:50:42.820]   The people would get used to imagery
[00:50:42.820 --> 00:50:44.780]   and expressing themselves through imagery.
[00:50:44.780 --> 00:50:46.660]   And that was so exciting.
[00:50:46.660 --> 00:50:49.940]   And it's been ruined by people selling,
[00:50:49.940 --> 00:50:51.420]   models selling sport tea.
[00:50:51.420 --> 00:50:56.420]   And it's really, anyway, so this is an interesting change.
[00:50:56.420 --> 00:51:00.340]   - And USC students showing for Amazon time.
[00:51:00.340 --> 00:51:02.420]   - Oh, Jay, yes, I know who you're talking about.
[00:51:02.420 --> 00:51:05.260]   - I wrote my first book on electronic communication
[00:51:05.260 --> 00:51:07.460]   in 1983.
[00:51:07.460 --> 00:51:10.620]   And there was only, there was a single chapter on security
[00:51:10.620 --> 00:51:12.660]   or privacy or Russian hacking.
[00:51:12.660 --> 00:51:15.300]   But I mean, I was so optimistic for so long.
[00:51:15.300 --> 00:51:17.220]   All the way through the 80s and 90s
[00:51:17.220 --> 00:51:18.620]   in the early part of the 2000s,
[00:51:18.620 --> 00:51:21.260]   I just thought this was such a wonderful thing.
[00:51:21.260 --> 00:51:23.820]   And I still see the positive.
[00:51:23.820 --> 00:51:27.060]   But I don't think many of us really fully appreciated
[00:51:27.060 --> 00:51:29.940]   the negative of overuse of technology
[00:51:29.940 --> 00:51:32.020]   until the last couple of years.
[00:51:32.020 --> 00:51:33.740]   - You know, one of the things that was just written
[00:51:33.740 --> 00:51:35.620]   in the chat room from Alberta Guru
[00:51:35.620 --> 00:51:37.260]   is, oh, this is a first world problem.
[00:51:37.260 --> 00:51:38.860]   But it really isn't.
[00:51:38.860 --> 00:51:40.140]   It really, really isn't.
[00:51:40.140 --> 00:51:43.220]   In fact, this took hold in a lot of what we would call
[00:51:43.220 --> 00:51:47.020]   third world countries before it took hold in advanced countries
[00:51:47.020 --> 00:51:49.580]   because electronic communications were actually more advanced
[00:51:49.580 --> 00:51:53.260]   in parts of Africa before they became completely ubiquitous
[00:51:53.260 --> 00:51:54.620]   and say the West.
[00:51:54.620 --> 00:51:56.580]   So this idea of being able to communicate,
[00:51:56.580 --> 00:51:58.420]   having your primary channel of communication
[00:51:58.420 --> 00:52:01.420]   not be face to face is not limited to social media.
[00:52:01.420 --> 00:52:03.860]   Social media really exacerbates it.
[00:52:03.860 --> 00:52:06.340]   But there's something that we need to do
[00:52:06.340 --> 00:52:09.100]   in order to look at what kind of relationships
[00:52:09.100 --> 00:52:10.140]   do we actually want.
[00:52:10.140 --> 00:52:15.340]   I can communicate, but too often I conflate communication
[00:52:15.340 --> 00:52:17.100]   with relationship and they're not the same.
[00:52:17.100 --> 00:52:19.100]   - Well, we were talking before we got on the air
[00:52:19.100 --> 00:52:22.340]   about Cardinal Togleaf, the professor from the Philippines
[00:52:22.340 --> 00:52:24.380]   that I was at an event at the Vatican
[00:52:24.380 --> 00:52:27.260]   where he spoke about some of the things that are going on
[00:52:27.260 --> 00:52:30.580]   online among his very low income parishioners.
[00:52:30.580 --> 00:52:32.980]   And you think about the problems that we're having
[00:52:32.980 --> 00:52:35.820]   on Facebook, this is life threatening stuff
[00:52:35.820 --> 00:52:37.500]   that these families are going through.
[00:52:37.500 --> 00:52:40.420]   - So I acknowledge First World problems.
[00:52:40.420 --> 00:52:42.500]   Absolutely, but here we are in the First World.
[00:52:42.500 --> 00:52:43.340]   - Mm-hmm.
[00:52:43.340 --> 00:52:45.500]   - There's nothing more First World
[00:52:45.500 --> 00:52:49.540]   than the scandal of the rich parents buying their way
[00:52:49.540 --> 00:52:51.100]   into college and yours.
[00:52:51.100 --> 00:52:54.140]   You were talking Ed bot about Livia Jade.
[00:52:54.140 --> 00:52:55.900]   I know what you were referring to.
[00:52:55.900 --> 00:52:56.740]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:52:56.740 --> 00:52:59.940]   - Her mom, Lori Loughlin, is accused of spending
[00:52:59.940 --> 00:53:02.580]   significant amount of money to get her into USC.
[00:53:02.580 --> 00:53:05.100]   Was it as a soccer star or a crew star?
[00:53:05.100 --> 00:53:06.100]   I can't remember.
[00:53:06.100 --> 00:53:06.940]   - I think it was crew.
[00:53:06.940 --> 00:53:10.340]   - Yeah, she wanted being the manager of the crew team
[00:53:10.340 --> 00:53:11.420]   had never done crew.
[00:53:11.420 --> 00:53:15.660]   - Never rode, but is a major Instagram influencer
[00:53:15.660 --> 00:53:18.300]   with I think more than a million followers.
[00:53:18.300 --> 00:53:19.940]   And of course, here's two of her posts.
[00:53:19.940 --> 00:53:21.340]   And this is the one you were talking about here.
[00:53:21.340 --> 00:53:23.740]   She is at USC in a paid partnership
[00:53:23.740 --> 00:53:28.580]   with Prime Student Amazon showing how everything here,
[00:53:28.580 --> 00:53:33.380]   she bought on Amazon, including the kind of tone deaf,
[00:53:33.380 --> 00:53:34.380]   OJ initials.
[00:53:34.380 --> 00:53:35.220]   - Yes, it's an agency.
[00:53:35.220 --> 00:53:37.780]   - She's her initials, but she is at USC.
[00:53:37.780 --> 00:53:38.620]   - Right.
[00:53:38.620 --> 00:53:42.260]   - So I'm just saying that's a little.
[00:53:42.260 --> 00:53:44.820]   - See, there's a generation that doesn't understand
[00:53:44.820 --> 00:53:45.740]   what's wrong with that.
[00:53:45.740 --> 00:53:48.420]   - Okay, should we explain that OJ was a famous running back
[00:53:48.420 --> 00:53:50.780]   at USC before OJ Simpson became a football?
[00:53:50.780 --> 00:53:52.140]   - He actually knew it had some legal trouble.
[00:53:52.140 --> 00:53:53.380]   - He didn't fake his way into USC.
[00:53:53.380 --> 00:53:54.860]   - He got into USC by running.
[00:53:54.860 --> 00:53:56.940]   - Yeah, because fast as he could.
[00:53:56.940 --> 00:53:58.580]   - We should miserable life later, but at the beginning--
[00:53:58.580 --> 00:53:59.860]   - Loughlin is accused of spending,
[00:53:59.860 --> 00:54:02.700]   this blows me away half a million dollars to get her daughter
[00:54:02.700 --> 00:54:04.020]   into USC.
[00:54:04.020 --> 00:54:05.660]   - And here's the thing about this whole story though,
[00:54:05.660 --> 00:54:09.700]   which is, yes, it's horrible and it's terrible
[00:54:09.700 --> 00:54:12.020]   and there should be outrage.
[00:54:12.020 --> 00:54:13.340]   This is not new.
[00:54:13.340 --> 00:54:15.660]   Rich people have been doing this forever.
[00:54:15.660 --> 00:54:17.100]   How many buildings on campuses?
[00:54:17.100 --> 00:54:18.860]   And I'm including some of our universities,
[00:54:18.860 --> 00:54:20.460]   like Georgetown, Boston College,
[00:54:20.460 --> 00:54:23.700]   are named after rich benefactors who had legacy children
[00:54:23.700 --> 00:54:24.860]   who came through because, well,
[00:54:24.860 --> 00:54:27.300]   the building's named after mom or dad.
[00:54:27.300 --> 00:54:30.860]   It's this, to pretend like it's only happening now
[00:54:30.860 --> 00:54:33.940]   and it's only happening because of social media influencers
[00:54:33.940 --> 00:54:34.940]   that's very disingenuous.
[00:54:34.940 --> 00:54:36.060]   - Oh, and you go even deeper than that.
[00:54:36.060 --> 00:54:38.420]   When you think about all of the test preparation classes,
[00:54:38.420 --> 00:54:41.380]   you could spend thousands of dollars legitimately
[00:54:41.380 --> 00:54:44.380]   preparing your wealthy kids to get into college
[00:54:44.380 --> 00:54:46.540]   that poor kids can't do.
[00:54:46.540 --> 00:54:48.060]   - I'm just glad that Olivia Jade,
[00:54:48.060 --> 00:54:50.700]   now that she's at a good university,
[00:54:50.700 --> 00:54:55.500]   is studying hard and working and learning and,
[00:54:55.500 --> 00:54:56.700]   well, wait a minute, what is she doing?
[00:54:56.700 --> 00:54:59.460]   It looks like she's mostly posing for Instagram, actually.
[00:54:59.460 --> 00:55:01.380]   - She already said that she doesn't care about that.
[00:55:01.380 --> 00:55:03.460]   - The cherry on top of the story was when they said,
[00:55:03.460 --> 00:55:06.100]   well, they had to call her back from the private yacht
[00:55:06.100 --> 00:55:07.740]   that was run by one of the regions
[00:55:07.740 --> 00:55:09.060]   because she was there for a party.
[00:55:09.060 --> 00:55:12.060]   She's like, oh, okay, well, yeah, that figure's.
[00:55:12.060 --> 00:55:13.380]   Yeah, what was going on that yacht?
[00:55:13.380 --> 00:55:16.380]   - All right, Carson, how much did your parents pay
[00:55:16.380 --> 00:55:17.340]   to get you into Harvard?
[00:55:17.340 --> 00:55:19.500]   'Cause I know you didn't get it on your own.
[00:55:19.500 --> 00:55:21.180]   - So, so much.
[00:55:21.180 --> 00:55:25.340]   - There's a Carson Bondi bench.
[00:55:25.340 --> 00:55:27.940]   - They bought a bench.
[00:55:27.940 --> 00:55:29.500]   - No, they couldn't afford the bench.
[00:55:29.500 --> 00:55:30.540]   They just got a stool.
[00:55:30.540 --> 00:55:31.700]   (laughing)
[00:55:31.700 --> 00:55:33.060]   - It'd Berkeley's as a twig.
[00:55:33.060 --> 00:55:35.540]   (laughing)
[00:55:35.540 --> 00:55:39.820]   - All right, Monday, tomorrow, Apple having a big event.
[00:55:39.820 --> 00:55:41.220]   And some have pointed out,
[00:55:41.220 --> 00:55:43.900]   I think this is probably accurate,
[00:55:43.900 --> 00:55:46.620]   that this is going to be the day we look back on,
[00:55:46.620 --> 00:55:50.420]   that Apple pivoted from being a hardware company
[00:55:50.420 --> 00:55:51.740]   to being a services company.
[00:55:51.740 --> 00:55:53.580]   At least that is their goal.
[00:55:53.580 --> 00:55:54.420]   You agree, Ed?
[00:55:54.420 --> 00:55:59.620]   - Oh, I think that's probably a good line,
[00:55:59.620 --> 00:56:02.580]   a good line of demarcation to have here.
[00:56:02.580 --> 00:56:05.980]   I think what punctuates that is the fact
[00:56:05.980 --> 00:56:10.180]   that they announced three products last week on Twitter,
[00:56:10.180 --> 00:56:12.940]   that normally would have been the kind of products
[00:56:12.940 --> 00:56:17.220]   that would have gotten five to 10 minutes each on stage
[00:56:17.220 --> 00:56:19.460]   at next week's event.
[00:56:19.460 --> 00:56:24.380]   The new iPad, the new line of iPads and--
[00:56:24.380 --> 00:56:25.740]   - New iMacs.
[00:56:25.740 --> 00:56:28.580]   - New iMacs, one other.
[00:56:28.580 --> 00:56:31.980]   - Yeah, they also reduced the price on the extra RAM
[00:56:31.980 --> 00:56:33.780]   on an iMac Pro.
[00:56:33.780 --> 00:56:34.780]   But you're exactly right,
[00:56:34.780 --> 00:56:37.260]   they didn't do these hardware announcements in public,
[00:56:37.260 --> 00:56:40.220]   they just slipped them in, they've done that before.
[00:56:40.220 --> 00:56:41.540]   - The other one was the AirPods.
[00:56:41.540 --> 00:56:43.180]   - Oh yeah, the AirPods, which I ordered.
[00:56:43.180 --> 00:56:44.100]   - Yeah, the new AirPods.
[00:56:44.100 --> 00:56:49.100]   And so the idea, they've been clearly focusing
[00:56:49.100 --> 00:56:53.100]   on the revenue that comes from services,
[00:56:53.100 --> 00:56:56.500]   from monetizing their base of,
[00:56:56.500 --> 00:57:01.100]   I think it's 1.4 billion Apple branded devices
[00:57:01.100 --> 00:57:02.300]   that are out there.
[00:57:02.300 --> 00:57:07.300]   And if you can get 10, 15, 20 bucks a year
[00:57:07.300 --> 00:57:11.940]   out of each one of those devices,
[00:57:11.940 --> 00:57:14.340]   that's not a lot for the owners of those devices,
[00:57:14.340 --> 00:57:18.860]   but that's a tremendous amount of money for Apple.
[00:57:18.860 --> 00:57:22.700]   And so the idea, if now if you go from $10 on average
[00:57:22.700 --> 00:57:26.460]   to $20 on average, you're up to $20 billion
[00:57:26.460 --> 00:57:28.900]   a year in revenue and that's staggering.
[00:57:28.900 --> 00:57:30.060]   - Well, you're actually probably talking
[00:57:30.060 --> 00:57:31.340]   closer to $10 a month though.
[00:57:31.340 --> 00:57:33.660]   I mean, the revenue potential,
[00:57:33.660 --> 00:57:35.540]   if you think about how often do the average person
[00:57:35.540 --> 00:57:39.300]   buy a device, probably a computer every three or four years,
[00:57:39.300 --> 00:57:41.220]   a phone maybe every two years,
[00:57:41.220 --> 00:57:43.540]   if you can get somebody to subscribe
[00:57:43.540 --> 00:57:46.700]   and have a steady stream of revenue,
[00:57:46.700 --> 00:57:49.220]   that's the difference between selling a razor
[00:57:49.220 --> 00:57:50.540]   and selling razor blades.
[00:57:50.540 --> 00:57:51.980]   - Right, right, right.
[00:57:51.980 --> 00:57:53.140]   The point that I was making though
[00:57:53.140 --> 00:57:54.380]   is that in a lot of cases,
[00:57:54.380 --> 00:57:56.620]   Apple share of that is only 30%.
[00:57:56.620 --> 00:57:57.620]   - Right.
[00:57:57.620 --> 00:58:01.260]   - And there are a significant number,
[00:58:01.260 --> 00:58:03.260]   I mean, there's a bell curve, right,
[00:58:03.260 --> 00:58:08.220]   of the distribution of services income
[00:58:08.220 --> 00:58:09.540]   from individual owners.
[00:58:09.540 --> 00:58:11.580]   There are certainly people who,
[00:58:11.580 --> 00:58:13.540]   they buy an app every once in a while
[00:58:13.540 --> 00:58:16.340]   and that's it, they don't spend another dime.
[00:58:16.340 --> 00:58:18.740]   On the other hand, there are people who,
[00:58:18.740 --> 00:58:20.540]   replace their phone every year
[00:58:20.540 --> 00:58:23.620]   and spend $100 a month on Apple services.
[00:58:23.620 --> 00:58:25.060]   So you get those in there.
[00:58:25.060 --> 00:58:28.220]   But I'm just talking about the share of revenue
[00:58:28.220 --> 00:58:30.260]   that Apple gets to keep.
[00:58:30.260 --> 00:58:31.100]   - All right.
[00:58:31.100 --> 00:58:34.060]   Revenue in the service business last year,
[00:58:34.060 --> 00:58:39.060]   $40 billion, that's a 33% increase year over year
[00:58:39.060 --> 00:58:41.220]   and it's 15% of the total revenue
[00:58:41.220 --> 00:58:43.820]   and I'm sure that it will increase each year
[00:58:43.820 --> 00:58:46.140]   and it won't be long before it's more than half of the
[00:58:46.140 --> 00:58:46.980]   companies' revenue,
[00:58:46.980 --> 00:58:48.580]   especially since iPhone sales and Mac sales
[00:58:48.580 --> 00:58:51.940]   have slowed, iPad sales have slowed.
[00:58:51.940 --> 00:58:52.820]   They need to do this.
[00:58:52.820 --> 00:58:54.100]   People aren't buying new phones,
[00:58:54.100 --> 00:58:57.140]   new computers every two years.
[00:58:57.140 --> 00:58:58.620]   - But this is a hard pivot.
[00:58:58.620 --> 00:58:59.740]   This is a very hard pivot.
[00:58:59.740 --> 00:59:01.660]   I mean, Microsoft made this pivot
[00:59:01.660 --> 00:59:02.940]   fantastically successfully.
[00:59:02.940 --> 00:59:03.780]   - They did, didn't they?
[00:59:03.780 --> 00:59:05.220]   - They did, I mean, over the past five years,
[00:59:05.220 --> 00:59:08.020]   their stock has outpaced Apple by a large margin
[00:59:08.020 --> 00:59:10.100]   because they made the commitment to services
[00:59:10.100 --> 00:59:12.460]   but they already had the infrastructure in there.
[00:59:12.460 --> 00:59:14.820]   They already had Azure, they already had 365
[00:59:14.820 --> 00:59:17.060]   and so when they made that pivot, it made sense.
[00:59:17.060 --> 00:59:19.300]   Now they had a cash cow in Dynamics
[00:59:19.300 --> 00:59:21.900]   but the entire Microsoft ecosystem
[00:59:21.900 --> 00:59:22.740]   was set for services.
[00:59:22.740 --> 00:59:27.740]   - Can't you argue that Microsoft had its strengths
[00:59:27.740 --> 00:59:30.220]   in that kind of business cloud
[00:59:30.220 --> 00:59:32.700]   but Apple has a strength that they can base this on
[00:59:32.700 --> 00:59:35.340]   which is in content, consumer content sales.
[00:59:35.340 --> 00:59:37.460]   They've got apps, they've got music.
[00:59:37.460 --> 00:59:38.940]   What they're gonna launch tomorrow,
[00:59:38.940 --> 00:59:41.540]   we're pretty sure is a news subscription program
[00:59:41.540 --> 00:59:43.620]   which will include magazines and newspapers.
[00:59:43.620 --> 00:59:47.020]   According to somebody, the Wall Street Journal
[00:59:47.020 --> 00:59:49.340]   will be in that bundle but not the New York Times
[00:59:49.340 --> 00:59:50.900]   or the Washington Post
[00:59:50.900 --> 00:59:55.620]   and a TV product that initially won't actually make them
[00:59:55.620 --> 00:59:57.860]   much money because it'll just be repackaging content
[00:59:57.860 --> 01:00:00.380]   from other people but ultimately has the potential
[01:00:00.380 --> 01:00:01.660]   to make them money because they're making
[01:00:01.660 --> 01:00:04.940]   a lot of original content and there's also a rumor,
[01:00:04.940 --> 01:00:07.380]   I don't know if this is true, it's kind of a lesser rumor
[01:00:07.380 --> 01:00:09.860]   that they're gonna do a game subscription service
[01:00:09.860 --> 01:00:11.820]   that will include paid games
[01:00:11.820 --> 01:00:15.140]   and that they will pay the game publisher a fee
[01:00:15.140 --> 01:00:18.620]   for every minute played so that the Apple collect
[01:00:18.620 --> 01:00:20.380]   a certain amount of money and then distribute it
[01:00:20.380 --> 01:00:22.100]   according to which games you play the most.
[01:00:22.100 --> 01:00:26.060]   And that gives Apple absolutely a leg up in services
[01:00:26.060 --> 01:00:26.900]   for consumers.
[01:00:26.900 --> 01:00:27.900]   This is something they already do, they're terrible
[01:00:27.900 --> 01:00:30.740]   and frankly Apple's terrible at cloud services.
[01:00:30.740 --> 01:00:33.700]   Right, and it's smarter than to focus on content.
[01:00:33.700 --> 01:00:36.020]   It's smart but the money, where they actually want
[01:00:36.020 --> 01:00:38.700]   the money in services, it's not in the consumer side,
[01:00:38.700 --> 01:00:40.020]   it's on the enterprise side.
[01:00:40.020 --> 01:00:41.020]   You see, that's one--
[01:00:41.020 --> 01:00:43.740]   Oh, you don't want to compete against Amazon, Microsoft
[01:00:43.740 --> 01:00:44.580]   and Google.
[01:00:44.580 --> 01:00:46.020]   But that's what the money is, you have to compete
[01:00:46.020 --> 01:00:47.540]   against them if you want that service money.
[01:00:47.540 --> 01:00:49.020]   I don't think Apple's ever gonna ever
[01:00:49.020 --> 01:00:51.420]   be a big of the enterprise side.
[01:00:51.420 --> 01:00:53.260]   They've never been strong in the enterprise side.
[01:00:53.260 --> 01:00:57.020]   But it just strikes me that if they can figure out a way
[01:00:57.020 --> 01:00:59.380]   to first of all lock in to the extent possible
[01:00:59.380 --> 01:01:03.100]   they're hardware owners, that alone is a huge market.
[01:01:03.100 --> 01:01:06.420]   And the ecosystem that is so valuable
[01:01:06.420 --> 01:01:08.500]   that nobody ever wants to use a Windows machine
[01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:09.780]   or a Samsung phone.
[01:01:09.780 --> 01:01:11.420]   And one of the things that always struck me,
[01:01:11.420 --> 01:01:14.100]   when Apple made the decision to make the iPod
[01:01:14.100 --> 01:01:16.180]   available for Windows, remember that the iPod was very
[01:01:16.180 --> 01:01:17.180]   fast.
[01:01:17.180 --> 01:01:20.500]   But it's what made it, it's what really made the iPod.
[01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:23.300]   And I always wonder why they can't do that
[01:01:23.300 --> 01:01:25.340]   with some of their other services.
[01:01:25.340 --> 01:01:27.940]   Why, for example, isn't Apple Music for Android?
[01:01:27.940 --> 01:01:28.540]   Right.
[01:01:28.540 --> 01:01:29.380]   Because--
[01:01:29.380 --> 01:01:30.580]   Well, there is.
[01:01:30.580 --> 01:01:31.380]   There is.
[01:01:31.380 --> 01:01:31.860]   There is.
[01:01:31.860 --> 01:01:32.660]   Apple Music is on Android.
[01:01:32.660 --> 01:01:33.380]   Oh, Apple Music is.
[01:01:33.380 --> 01:01:34.140]   What's not is messages.
[01:01:34.140 --> 01:01:35.780]   Yeah, I'm sorry, that belief again.
[01:01:35.780 --> 01:01:38.340]   The thing is, though, when Microsoft made the pivot,
[01:01:38.340 --> 01:01:40.300]   they did something that was incredibly controversial
[01:01:40.300 --> 01:01:41.220]   in the Windows world.
[01:01:41.220 --> 01:01:43.980]   And that was, they basically deprecated Windows.
[01:01:43.980 --> 01:01:44.780]   They did.
[01:01:44.780 --> 01:01:47.140]   And they said, we'll be wherever our customers are.
[01:01:47.140 --> 01:01:48.620]   Even if it's on Linux.
[01:01:48.620 --> 01:01:49.060]   Right.
[01:01:49.060 --> 01:01:51.220]   And people thought that all Microsoft's done.
[01:01:51.220 --> 01:01:53.220]   But that's what allowed the pivot to work.
[01:01:53.220 --> 01:01:55.420]   Do you think Apple can say, OK, well, you know what?
[01:01:55.420 --> 01:01:57.260]   The iPhone's been big for us, but we're not good.
[01:01:57.260 --> 01:01:58.860]   That's not the first thing we push anymore.
[01:01:58.860 --> 01:02:00.300]   Microservices.
[01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:02.260]   Microsoft is the exact opposite of what Apple will do.
[01:02:02.260 --> 01:02:02.940]   You agree, Ed?
[01:02:02.940 --> 01:02:05.820]   That Microsoft-- that was huge for an unpredictable--
[01:02:05.820 --> 01:02:09.940]   by everybody, Satya Nadella would say, no, we're going to be open.
[01:02:09.940 --> 01:02:12.540]   We're going to be everywhere our customers want us to be.
[01:02:12.540 --> 01:02:16.020]   I think it was the inevitable result of something
[01:02:16.020 --> 01:02:21.220]   that had started probably five years before Satya Nadella
[01:02:21.220 --> 01:02:24.340]   took over as CEO.
[01:02:24.340 --> 01:02:27.060]   You need to give Steve Ballmer a lot of credit.
[01:02:27.060 --> 01:02:27.700]   Really?
[01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:29.340]   Or for having put--
[01:02:29.340 --> 01:02:30.060]   Absolutely.
[01:02:30.060 --> 01:02:32.340]   You have to give Steve Ballmer a lot of credit
[01:02:32.340 --> 01:02:38.900]   for having given Satya Nadella the executive position
[01:02:38.900 --> 01:02:42.300]   and building the cloud-based businesses
[01:02:42.300 --> 01:02:46.260]   that made it logical for him to be promoted to CEO.
[01:02:46.260 --> 01:02:48.180]   The reason he was promoted to CEO
[01:02:48.180 --> 01:02:51.140]   was because he had been given the freedom
[01:02:51.140 --> 01:02:54.180]   to build those businesses.
[01:02:54.180 --> 01:02:57.060]   He ran Azure before he was CEO, right?
[01:02:57.060 --> 01:02:57.940]   Exactly.
[01:02:57.940 --> 01:02:58.460]   Right.
[01:02:58.460 --> 01:02:59.540]   Exactly.
[01:02:59.540 --> 01:03:02.300]   But Ballmer never would have made that pivot.
[01:03:02.300 --> 01:03:03.140]   I mean, yes.
[01:03:03.140 --> 01:03:04.580]   I think that's what happened.
[01:03:04.580 --> 01:03:06.820]   The board said, OK, now we're ready to pivot.
[01:03:06.820 --> 01:03:08.420]   Thank you, Steve, for your service.
[01:03:08.420 --> 01:03:10.260]   Go buy a basketball team.
[01:03:10.260 --> 01:03:14.060]   And even though they did a very public executive search
[01:03:14.060 --> 01:03:16.660]   for the next CEO, as it turned out,
[01:03:16.660 --> 01:03:19.860]   they made the exact right choice by promoting from within.
[01:03:19.860 --> 01:03:25.500]   Well, the other reason that Ballmer was allowed
[01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:29.540]   to buy a basketball team in Southern California
[01:03:29.540 --> 01:03:33.460]   is the disastrous Nokia acquisition.
[01:03:33.460 --> 01:03:34.460]   Right.
[01:03:34.460 --> 01:03:35.060]   You know, that's--
[01:03:35.060 --> 01:03:37.940]   Satya Nadella argued against from day one, as I remember.
[01:03:37.940 --> 01:03:39.660]   He was dead set against it.
[01:03:39.660 --> 01:03:40.100]   Right.
[01:03:40.100 --> 01:03:43.700]   And one of the very first things that he did when he came on
[01:03:43.700 --> 01:03:47.900]   as CEO was to start the wheels in motion
[01:03:47.900 --> 01:03:52.420]   to unwind virtually all of that.
[01:03:52.420 --> 01:03:56.780]   So that today, there is no Windows Phone software.
[01:03:56.780 --> 01:03:59.940]   The Nokia is no longer a part of Microsoft.
[01:03:59.940 --> 01:04:02.380]   Microsoft is not building--
[01:04:02.380 --> 01:04:04.220]   there's no Surface Phone.
[01:04:04.220 --> 01:04:07.420]   And there probably won't be.
[01:04:07.420 --> 01:04:10.300]   Don't forget to get Donald Sterling some credit
[01:04:10.300 --> 01:04:12.220]   for Ballmer's ability.
[01:04:12.220 --> 01:04:14.620]   He was the guy who owned the Lakers.
[01:04:14.620 --> 01:04:16.580]   It was all caught up in that scandal.
[01:04:16.580 --> 01:04:17.420]   That's true.
[01:04:17.420 --> 01:04:19.100]   Yeah, the Clippers have the other scandal.
[01:04:19.100 --> 01:04:21.420]   Otherwise, Ballmer wouldn't have made the pivot to NBA team
[01:04:21.420 --> 01:04:21.700]   on her.
[01:04:21.700 --> 01:04:22.700]   Exactly.
[01:04:22.700 --> 01:04:23.380]   So that's--
[01:04:23.380 --> 01:04:26.780]   It was a series of pivots that were basically a role.
[01:04:26.780 --> 01:04:28.220]   So and I understand the Patriots
[01:04:28.220 --> 01:04:29.580]   may be up for grabs any day.
[01:04:29.580 --> 01:04:30.140]   That's right.
[01:04:30.140 --> 01:04:30.460]   That's right.
[01:04:30.460 --> 01:04:31.820]   That would be the word.
[01:04:31.820 --> 01:04:35.180]   So up for grab-- yeah, well, you know what I mean.
[01:04:35.180 --> 01:04:37.260]   No, seriously.
[01:04:37.260 --> 01:04:40.020]   This has been one of the few really, truly successful
[01:04:40.020 --> 01:04:42.540]   business pivots that you can point at in the tech industry.
[01:04:42.540 --> 01:04:44.980]   It's historically a very difficult thing to do.
[01:04:44.980 --> 01:04:49.060]   And a lot of credit to whoever, Ballmer Nadella, whoever.
[01:04:49.060 --> 01:04:51.940]   But do you think Apple's trying to do something
[01:04:51.940 --> 01:04:54.660]   of that magnitude?
[01:04:54.660 --> 01:04:55.140]   They can't.
[01:04:55.140 --> 01:05:01.540]   Well, every large company in Silicon Valley
[01:05:01.540 --> 01:05:05.740]   has to eventually face the fact that they
[01:05:05.740 --> 01:05:10.820]   have a dominant product that is both their strength
[01:05:10.820 --> 01:05:14.420]   and their potential downfall.
[01:05:14.420 --> 01:05:17.540]   And so disrupting your own product,
[01:05:17.540 --> 01:05:21.020]   disrupting your own key product is really important.
[01:05:21.020 --> 01:05:23.380]   But Apple doesn't really have any choice.
[01:05:23.380 --> 01:05:29.620]   They've seen the slowing in sales of their hardware
[01:05:29.620 --> 01:05:32.060]   products for a number of years.
[01:05:32.060 --> 01:05:35.220]   And although those businesses are still--
[01:05:35.220 --> 01:05:39.620]   they are cranking out as much revenue and profit for Apple
[01:05:39.620 --> 01:05:43.100]   as Windows and Office were for Microsoft back
[01:05:43.100 --> 01:05:45.780]   when Microsoft was preparing to do that pivot.
[01:05:45.780 --> 01:05:47.540]   But the writing was on the wall.
[01:05:47.540 --> 01:05:49.620]   There's no growth there anymore.
[01:05:49.620 --> 01:05:52.420]   And so you have to find another place
[01:05:52.420 --> 01:05:53.980]   where you can get some growth.
[01:05:53.980 --> 01:05:57.180]   The company that hasn't been able to do that at all
[01:05:57.180 --> 01:06:04.940]   is Google, which continues to be a company that they
[01:06:04.940 --> 01:06:08.300]   bought Motorola and then sold it.
[01:06:08.300 --> 01:06:11.060]   They keep trying to figure out ways
[01:06:11.060 --> 01:06:15.780]   to get into the enterprise, but they're not successful at it.
[01:06:15.780 --> 01:06:20.300]   They keep coming up with frankly interesting hardware
[01:06:20.300 --> 01:06:23.780]   products, but they don't turn into real businesses.
[01:06:23.780 --> 01:06:31.020]   Google Fiber has been at best a middling business
[01:06:31.020 --> 01:06:33.580]   and by some measures a failure.
[01:06:33.580 --> 01:06:39.420]   And so there's still a company that is 88% advertising.
[01:06:39.420 --> 01:06:40.860]   And it feels like they're thrashing.
[01:06:40.860 --> 01:06:42.460]   They are getting into education.
[01:06:42.460 --> 01:06:45.820]   I mean, they've done pretty well in education.
[01:06:45.820 --> 01:06:47.060]   But I don't know how much money they're in.
[01:06:47.060 --> 01:06:48.500]   But April 2nd, they're going to kill inbox.
[01:06:48.500 --> 01:06:50.260]   They're going to kill Google+,, they're
[01:06:50.260 --> 01:06:52.140]   going to kill what else--
[01:06:52.140 --> 01:06:52.980]   Aloe.
[01:06:52.980 --> 01:06:54.460]   They're the world's largest startup.
[01:06:54.460 --> 01:06:55.620]   They still run like a startup.
[01:06:55.620 --> 01:06:57.580]   And I think that's intentional.
[01:06:57.580 --> 01:06:59.660]   Anyway, we're going to talk about Google's big announcement
[01:06:59.660 --> 01:07:02.580]   this week, which is Stadia, just a little bit.
[01:07:02.580 --> 01:07:07.540]   But before we move on, I want to ask the one question.
[01:07:07.540 --> 01:07:10.060]   I think we do see tomorrow Apple making a pivot
[01:07:10.060 --> 01:07:12.100]   from a hardware company to a services company.
[01:07:12.100 --> 01:07:15.180]   We mentioned that the shining difference
[01:07:15.180 --> 01:07:17.580]   in what Microsoft's done and what Apple's doing
[01:07:17.580 --> 01:07:20.980]   is Microsoft's become more open as a result of this pivot.
[01:07:20.980 --> 01:07:22.540]   They become more agnostic.
[01:07:22.540 --> 01:07:23.980]   You don't have to use Windows.
[01:07:23.980 --> 01:07:27.540]   You don't have to be on Microsoft hardware by any means.
[01:07:27.540 --> 01:07:29.860]   Apple, it sounds like, is going to double down
[01:07:29.860 --> 01:07:30.820]   on its ecosystem.
[01:07:30.820 --> 01:07:32.260]   The whole point of Apple's service
[01:07:32.260 --> 01:07:34.020]   is I think you were pointing this out, Larry,
[01:07:34.020 --> 01:07:37.340]   is not to support Samsung or Microsoft,
[01:07:37.340 --> 01:07:39.220]   but to support Apple and to encourage people
[01:07:39.220 --> 01:07:41.860]   to get locked in Apple services.
[01:07:41.860 --> 01:07:44.020]   Is this strategically the right play?
[01:07:44.020 --> 01:07:45.740]   It's very different than what Microsoft did.
[01:07:45.740 --> 01:07:48.860]   We could say Microsoft's been successful opening up.
[01:07:48.860 --> 01:07:50.340]   Apple's not opening up.
[01:07:50.340 --> 01:07:51.860]   Is that the right thing to do?
[01:07:51.860 --> 01:07:53.420]   I think globally it's the wrong play.
[01:07:53.420 --> 01:07:55.980]   I mean, they may be able to do quite well in America
[01:07:55.980 --> 01:07:56.260]   and maybe--
[01:07:56.260 --> 01:07:57.180]   Where they are dominant.
[01:07:57.180 --> 01:07:58.860]   And other parts of the developed world perhaps.
[01:07:58.860 --> 01:08:00.700]   But if you're thinking about the entire world,
[01:08:00.700 --> 01:08:02.900]   you're thinking about the developing world,
[01:08:02.900 --> 01:08:03.500]   it's a death song.
[01:08:03.500 --> 01:08:04.980]   Samsung owns the rest of the world.
[01:08:04.980 --> 01:08:05.580]   Absolutely.
[01:08:05.580 --> 01:08:08.180]   Because-- and also, Samsung has a range of products
[01:08:08.180 --> 01:08:09.820]   that are range of price points.
[01:08:09.820 --> 01:08:11.660]   There is no such thing as a cheap iPhone.
[01:08:11.660 --> 01:08:13.380]   They're automatically Samsung--
[01:08:13.380 --> 01:08:16.340]   Trying and failed with the ecosystem play.
[01:08:16.340 --> 01:08:17.620]   They had Samsung milk.
[01:08:17.620 --> 01:08:19.100]   They had Samsung store.
[01:08:19.100 --> 01:08:19.980]   They had Samsung--
[01:08:19.980 --> 01:08:21.460]   And there was a horrible--
[01:08:21.460 --> 01:08:22.500]   Milk was their music.
[01:08:22.500 --> 01:08:24.980]   In case you didn't know, it wasn't actual dairy products.
[01:08:24.980 --> 01:08:25.980]   It was their music store.
[01:08:25.980 --> 01:08:26.820]   I thought there was a--
[01:08:26.820 --> 01:08:29.140]   You could only put Samsung milk in a Samsung refrigerator.
[01:08:29.140 --> 01:08:30.740]   A terrible name.
[01:08:30.740 --> 01:08:34.100]   But so Samsung was not able to do the ecosystem play.
[01:08:34.100 --> 01:08:36.740]   No, but they've been able to create a variety of products
[01:08:36.740 --> 01:08:38.020]   that are variety of price points.
[01:08:38.020 --> 01:08:40.900]   We only hear about the 10, the high-end ones here.
[01:08:40.900 --> 01:08:42.980]   But there are Samsung phones out there that you can buy from.
[01:08:42.980 --> 01:08:45.380]   Oh, I-- people call the radio station all the time.
[01:08:45.380 --> 01:08:49.780]   With questions like, I've got a Samsung J3.
[01:08:49.780 --> 01:08:50.420]   What do you think?
[01:08:50.420 --> 01:08:51.100]   I don't know.
[01:08:51.100 --> 01:08:52.500]   I never even heard of it.
[01:08:52.500 --> 01:08:54.740]   Verizon gives it away as a deal.
[01:08:54.740 --> 01:08:58.500]   It's an Android 4 phone that you can get for free.
[01:08:58.500 --> 01:09:00.100]   So no, there's a lot of Samsung devices on there.
[01:09:00.100 --> 01:09:01.580]   The other problem with Apple is let's face it.
[01:09:01.580 --> 01:09:03.620]   I mean, iPhones are great, but so are pixels.
[01:09:03.620 --> 01:09:05.100]   So are Samsung.
[01:09:05.100 --> 01:09:06.700]   I mean, you have to be honest with you,
[01:09:06.700 --> 01:09:08.980]   the best phone I've ever used is the S10 Plus.
[01:09:08.980 --> 01:09:10.300]   This thing is amazing.
[01:09:10.300 --> 01:09:13.700]   Yeah, and the point is that you could argue,
[01:09:13.700 --> 01:09:18.060]   is it better or not quite as good as the Apple 10S?
[01:09:18.060 --> 01:09:19.940]   But the point that you have-- the fact
[01:09:19.940 --> 01:09:22.020]   you have to have that discussion means that Apple--
[01:09:22.020 --> 01:09:23.060]   There's no clear winner.
[01:09:23.060 --> 01:09:23.340]   Yeah.
[01:09:23.340 --> 01:09:25.500]   In 2007, there was no question.
[01:09:25.500 --> 01:09:26.700]   Yeah.
[01:09:26.700 --> 01:09:27.940]   I bought a phone.
[01:09:27.940 --> 01:09:30.380]   Of course, it was $1,500, which Apple would love to sell me
[01:09:30.380 --> 01:09:31.740]   a phone for $1,500.
[01:09:31.740 --> 01:09:34.620]   Actually, I did think I did buy a phone from Apple 50.
[01:09:34.620 --> 01:09:35.820]   Like, I'm going to think of it.
[01:09:35.820 --> 01:09:38.540]   My maxed out 10S was, in fact, the same price
[01:09:38.540 --> 01:09:41.260]   as the Samsung maxed out 10 Plus maxed out.
[01:09:41.260 --> 01:09:43.060]   But it has a terabyte of storage.
[01:09:43.060 --> 01:09:44.900]   It has 12 gigabytes of RAM.
[01:09:44.900 --> 01:09:46.900]   My iPhone has four.
[01:09:46.900 --> 01:09:48.020]   It is a powerhouse.
[01:09:48.020 --> 01:09:50.820]   It's a desktop class processor.
[01:09:50.820 --> 01:09:52.660]   If you have more in my pocket, yeah.
[01:09:52.660 --> 01:09:54.820]   Better screen.
[01:09:54.820 --> 01:09:57.180]   Now, for me, one of the reasons I like the S10 Plus
[01:09:57.180 --> 01:10:01.300]   is because it's very customizable, which Apple is not.
[01:10:01.300 --> 01:10:04.180]   But I think a lot of consumers don't want all of that.
[01:10:04.180 --> 01:10:06.220]   What do you think, Ed, is the Apple ecosystem
[01:10:06.220 --> 01:10:09.020]   play a strong play or is it the mistake?
[01:10:09.020 --> 01:10:09.460]   Yeah.
[01:10:09.460 --> 01:10:13.740]   No, it's a very familiar play.
[01:10:13.740 --> 01:10:17.780]   If you look in the telecommunications industry,
[01:10:17.780 --> 01:10:21.820]   especially American telecommunications companies,
[01:10:21.820 --> 01:10:27.740]   they have historically been driven by a metric called ARPU,
[01:10:27.740 --> 01:10:29.980]   average revenue per user.
[01:10:29.980 --> 01:10:34.940]   And that, I think, is what Apple is going to with--
[01:10:34.940 --> 01:10:40.700]   they've been really focusing on their upgrade plans,
[01:10:40.700 --> 01:10:43.380]   for example, which are essentially leasing--
[01:10:43.380 --> 01:10:43.880]   Right.
[01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:46.500]   --you essentially wind up leasing your device from Apple.
[01:10:46.500 --> 01:10:51.820]   Zero down, and then $35 or $40 a month for the hardware.
[01:10:51.820 --> 01:10:54.580]   And then on top of that, they're going to layer some services
[01:10:54.580 --> 01:10:55.100]   on them.
[01:10:55.100 --> 01:10:58.380]   And that has historically been the way
[01:10:58.380 --> 01:11:04.100]   that every cell phone provider in the United States, at least,
[01:11:04.100 --> 01:11:05.340]   has worked.
[01:11:05.340 --> 01:11:07.540]   And it's also been the way that the cable companies have
[01:11:07.540 --> 01:11:07.860]   worked.
[01:11:07.860 --> 01:11:09.300]   You rent the box from them.
[01:11:09.300 --> 01:11:10.660]   People hate it.
[01:11:10.660 --> 01:11:11.260]   Sell you.
[01:11:11.260 --> 01:11:12.540]   Don't people hate it?
[01:11:12.540 --> 01:11:14.100]   Didn't Microsoft get a lot of heat?
[01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:16.420]   Because essentially, that's what they did with Windows
[01:11:16.420 --> 01:11:18.500]   and Office was turning it into a subscription product.
[01:11:18.500 --> 01:11:21.140]   And people hated that.
[01:11:21.140 --> 01:11:28.660]   Well, and the reason that Verizon is a very, very large company.
[01:11:28.660 --> 01:11:30.780]   OK.
[01:11:30.780 --> 01:11:33.220]   But that has historically-- but I'm not
[01:11:33.220 --> 01:11:35.820]   saying that they're being liked, that they're
[01:11:35.820 --> 01:11:39.700]   trying to become a telecommunications company.
[01:11:39.700 --> 01:11:42.660]   What I'm saying is that they're following what
[01:11:42.660 --> 01:11:45.700]   has historically been at various times
[01:11:45.700 --> 01:11:49.420]   in the history, recent history of technology,
[01:11:49.420 --> 01:11:51.780]   a very successful business model.
[01:11:51.780 --> 01:11:52.060]   You take--
[01:11:52.060 --> 01:11:53.980]   Look at the triple play that Comcast has.
[01:11:53.980 --> 01:11:54.540]   Oh, my god.
[01:11:54.540 --> 01:11:55.340]   I hate that.
[01:11:55.340 --> 01:11:55.860]   I know.
[01:11:55.860 --> 01:11:58.540]   I have somebody else's internet phone system.
[01:11:58.540 --> 01:11:59.860]   I don't have to hear that.
[01:11:59.860 --> 01:12:00.380]   Yeah.
[01:12:00.380 --> 01:12:02.100]   So there you go.
[01:12:02.100 --> 01:12:06.900]   There's a perfect example of it, because if you've ever--
[01:12:06.900 --> 01:12:09.700]   and I'm a Comcast customer, if you've ever priced out
[01:12:09.700 --> 01:12:13.100]   their services, you discover that it is typically
[01:12:13.100 --> 01:12:17.620]   cheaper to buy the bundle that has all the things in it
[01:12:17.620 --> 01:12:21.740]   than it is to try and put them together a little piece or two
[01:12:21.740 --> 01:12:22.460]   at a time.
[01:12:22.460 --> 01:12:26.660]   They price the individual things so high that they basically
[01:12:26.660 --> 01:12:30.820]   say, look, for only $10 more, you get all this stuff.
[01:12:30.820 --> 01:12:31.380]   Well, it's true.
[01:12:31.380 --> 01:12:33.740]   I have their high end-- I have their highest internet service
[01:12:33.740 --> 01:12:35.220]   that I can get where I live.
[01:12:35.220 --> 01:12:38.500]   And it turns out that basic cable is actually not very much
[01:12:38.500 --> 01:12:39.540]   more than that.
[01:12:39.540 --> 01:12:40.260]   Exactly.
[01:12:40.260 --> 01:12:42.220]   So I stick with it even though I hate it.
[01:12:42.220 --> 01:12:42.900]   It's incremental.
[01:12:42.900 --> 01:12:43.940]   It's incremental.
[01:12:43.940 --> 01:12:46.700]   What's interesting, though, and my impression
[01:12:46.700 --> 01:12:50.460]   is that that triple play is not cheaper
[01:12:50.460 --> 01:12:54.700]   than if you went to three different providers.
[01:12:54.700 --> 01:12:57.180]   So it's really more a pitch when you go to Comcast,
[01:12:57.180 --> 01:13:00.140]   hey, add all this for $10, add this for $10.
[01:13:00.140 --> 01:13:03.300]   But it's not if you put it all together any cheaper
[01:13:03.300 --> 01:13:06.900]   than using the phone company in Comcast, for instance.
[01:13:06.900 --> 01:13:07.700]   Right.
[01:13:07.700 --> 01:13:08.700]   But who's going to--
[01:13:08.700 --> 01:13:09.700]   But nobody does that.
[01:13:09.700 --> 01:13:11.900]   Oh, now they've had security systems and IoT.
[01:13:11.900 --> 01:13:12.940]   Yeah, they're going to get--
[01:13:12.940 --> 01:13:14.940]   My Comcast builds up to $200 a month now.
[01:13:14.940 --> 01:13:15.740]   Easily, yeah.
[01:13:15.740 --> 01:13:16.180]   Yeah.
[01:13:16.180 --> 01:13:17.700]   It's ridiculous.
[01:13:17.700 --> 01:13:18.780]   But they've done that.
[01:13:18.780 --> 01:13:21.500]   They've slowly boiled that water.
[01:13:21.500 --> 01:13:23.060]   Apparently, this is Tim--
[01:13:23.060 --> 01:13:26.460]   so if you say that the iPod or the iPhone
[01:13:26.460 --> 01:13:30.980]   was Steve Jobs' crowning jewel, services
[01:13:30.980 --> 01:13:32.380]   are Tim Cook's crown jewel.
[01:13:32.380 --> 01:13:33.980]   He began calling the Wall Street Journal
[01:13:33.980 --> 01:13:38.060]   pushing services hard in late 2017.
[01:13:38.060 --> 01:13:41.780]   And he's been saying that Apple will double service revenue
[01:13:41.780 --> 01:13:43.860]   by 2020.
[01:13:43.860 --> 01:13:45.700]   According to the Journal at Monthly Sessions,
[01:13:45.700 --> 01:13:48.620]   the 58-year-old CEO has peppered the team with detailed
[01:13:48.620 --> 01:13:49.500]   questions.
[01:13:49.500 --> 01:13:51.420]   He wanted services team members to tell them
[01:13:51.420 --> 01:13:53.140]   which apps are selling well.
[01:13:53.140 --> 01:13:56.180]   How many Apple Music subscribers stuck with a service?
[01:13:56.180 --> 01:13:59.380]   How many people were signing up for iCloud?
[01:13:59.380 --> 01:14:01.540]   iCloud, by the way, is not a competitive offering
[01:14:01.540 --> 01:14:03.900]   compared to Google Drive or Microsoft OneDrive.
[01:14:03.900 --> 01:14:05.100]   This is the problem.
[01:14:05.100 --> 01:14:07.060]   First, I stand by my--
[01:14:07.060 --> 01:14:08.380]   they need to compete in the enterprise
[01:14:08.380 --> 01:14:10.660]   if they actually want to make a lot of money on services.
[01:14:10.660 --> 01:14:12.260]   The second problem is, as Ed brought up,
[01:14:12.260 --> 01:14:13.740]   they are an ARPU company.
[01:14:13.740 --> 01:14:15.660]   They sell premium products at a premium price,
[01:14:15.660 --> 01:14:17.660]   and they always get the largest margin because their hardware
[01:14:17.660 --> 01:14:18.780]   is fantastic.
[01:14:18.780 --> 01:14:20.820]   When you go into the service industry,
[01:14:20.820 --> 01:14:23.260]   it is a commodity market.
[01:14:23.260 --> 01:14:25.220]   And you have to sell at scale.
[01:14:25.220 --> 01:14:26.980]   And they are not set up to do that.
[01:14:26.980 --> 01:14:28.020]   iCloud is--
[01:14:28.020 --> 01:14:28.540]   It's more--
[01:14:28.540 --> 01:14:31.420]   There's no way it's going to be a replacement for OneDrive
[01:14:31.420 --> 01:14:33.380]   or Google Drive or any other kind of drive.
[01:14:33.380 --> 01:14:34.820]   For that matter, it's not awesome.
[01:14:34.820 --> 01:14:35.900]   So they're not set up.
[01:14:35.900 --> 01:14:37.940]   I mean, I get why they're doing it.
[01:14:37.940 --> 01:14:39.340]   They are not set up with it.
[01:14:39.340 --> 01:14:42.300]   Except if you have an iPhone, it's a no-brainer.
[01:14:42.300 --> 01:14:44.460]   You flick a switch and iCloud's in there.
[01:14:44.460 --> 01:14:46.700]   And then when you fill up the free five gigs,
[01:14:46.700 --> 01:14:48.420]   it starts saying you're running out of room.
[01:14:48.420 --> 01:14:49.940]   You haven't backed up in three months.
[01:14:49.940 --> 01:14:52.620]   It bugs you until you say, OK, OK, I know,
[01:14:52.620 --> 01:14:53.860]   because I'm paying three bucks a month.
[01:14:53.860 --> 01:14:55.540]   It just sounds like the Clinton Justice Department
[01:14:55.540 --> 01:14:58.380]   talking about Microsoft when you're talking this way.
[01:14:58.380 --> 01:14:59.620]   It very much is like that.
[01:14:59.620 --> 01:15:01.900]   It's like bundling the browser, except there's
[01:15:01.900 --> 01:15:03.460]   much less justification for it.
[01:15:03.460 --> 01:15:05.340]   I wonder why Apple has not been--
[01:15:05.340 --> 01:15:07.620]   I mean, there's been some rumblings about antitrust in Apple.
[01:15:07.620 --> 01:15:08.140]   But you never--
[01:15:08.140 --> 01:15:10.620]   The only person who's criticized Apple as Elizabeth Warren.
[01:15:10.620 --> 01:15:12.420]   And it was an afterthought after she said
[01:15:12.420 --> 01:15:14.820]   you should break up Google, Amazon, and Microsoft.
[01:15:14.820 --> 01:15:16.260]   And all you Apple to, yeah.
[01:15:16.260 --> 01:15:17.060]   It went over well and still had Apple.
[01:15:17.060 --> 01:15:19.180]   Everybody loves Apple.
[01:15:19.180 --> 01:15:20.660]   Nobody wants to break up Apple.
[01:15:20.660 --> 01:15:24.420]   And yet, if you're trapped in the Apple ecosystem,
[01:15:24.420 --> 01:15:25.940]   it is the worst kind of monopoly.
[01:15:25.940 --> 01:15:27.100]   Oh, absolutely.
[01:15:27.100 --> 01:15:28.540]   And what's amazing too about my--
[01:15:28.540 --> 01:15:32.140]   and some of my best friends are Apple users.
[01:15:32.140 --> 01:15:35.380]   And what they do is they live only in that ecosystem.
[01:15:35.380 --> 01:15:37.740]   It wouldn't occur to my Mac friends
[01:15:37.740 --> 01:15:40.740]   to buy anything other than an iPhone and to use anything other.
[01:15:40.740 --> 01:15:42.220]   They just can't escape.
[01:15:42.220 --> 01:15:44.180]   It's a no-brainer.
[01:15:44.180 --> 01:15:46.420]   And they're companies like Netflix and Spotify,
[01:15:46.420 --> 01:15:49.620]   both of whom said, we're not going to pay the Apple 30%
[01:15:49.620 --> 01:15:50.140]   anymore.
[01:15:50.140 --> 01:15:51.380]   We don't want to pay that anymore.
[01:15:51.380 --> 01:15:56.500]   Spotify's put out a website saying, time to play fair Apple.
[01:15:56.500 --> 01:15:58.220]   They've been taking potshots back and forth.
[01:15:58.220 --> 01:15:59.460]   And this is my skepticism.
[01:15:59.460 --> 01:16:02.780]   So you know, for example, that Apple TV does not
[01:16:02.780 --> 01:16:05.340]   do as well as Roku as one of many--
[01:16:05.340 --> 01:16:06.260]   It's much more expensive.
[01:16:06.260 --> 01:16:07.140]   It's much more expensive.
[01:16:07.140 --> 01:16:07.980]   And it's not as good.
[01:16:07.980 --> 01:16:09.180]   It's not as versatile.
[01:16:09.180 --> 01:16:10.060]   And the question is--
[01:16:10.060 --> 01:16:12.100]   On the other hand, if you're locked in the Apple's ecosystem,
[01:16:12.100 --> 01:16:15.820]   if you're an iTunes, it's the only device that plays iTunes.
[01:16:15.820 --> 01:16:17.220]   So that's their leverage, right?
[01:16:17.220 --> 01:16:20.100]   You're going to get that $200 out of somebody
[01:16:20.100 --> 01:16:22.140]   because, well, wait a minute, all my movies are in iTunes.
[01:16:22.140 --> 01:16:22.660]   Right.
[01:16:22.660 --> 01:16:23.620]   If that's the world you're in.
[01:16:23.620 --> 01:16:26.100]   But I'm just saying, but when competing-- just stand alone
[01:16:26.100 --> 01:16:28.180]   against Roku, they can't compete with your iPhone.
[01:16:28.180 --> 01:16:29.580]   It's quite the quality.
[01:16:29.580 --> 01:16:31.420]   And of course, there was some speculation
[01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:34.300]   about whether Apple Music would do well and it has done well.
[01:16:34.300 --> 01:16:37.380]   There was a lot of concern that it wouldn't be able to compete
[01:16:37.380 --> 01:16:37.900]   with Spotify.
[01:16:37.900 --> 01:16:38.740]   No, it's competed quite well.
[01:16:38.740 --> 01:16:39.420]   It done well.
[01:16:39.420 --> 01:16:41.100]   But Spotify would say they compete well
[01:16:41.100 --> 01:16:43.340]   because they charge us 30% extra.
[01:16:43.340 --> 01:16:44.900]   So we have to tack that on.
[01:16:44.900 --> 01:16:49.340]   So we cost $12.99 a month, whereas Apple Music's only $9.90
[01:16:49.340 --> 01:16:55.340]   a month on the iTunes store because there's no 30% vig.
[01:16:55.340 --> 01:16:56.980]   So that seems--
[01:16:56.980 --> 01:16:57.820]   You're right.
[01:16:57.820 --> 01:16:59.740]   It seems kind of anti-competitive.
[01:16:59.740 --> 01:17:01.260]   They're not a monopoly.
[01:17:01.260 --> 01:17:03.260]   So maybe that's not monopolistic behavior.
[01:17:03.260 --> 01:17:04.740]   They're only 50% of the market.
[01:17:04.740 --> 01:17:07.540]   They're not competing against Microsoft or Amazon
[01:17:07.540 --> 01:17:08.300]   or Google for this.
[01:17:08.300 --> 01:17:09.580]   You know how they're competing against?
[01:17:09.580 --> 01:17:09.580]   Who?
[01:17:09.580 --> 01:17:11.020]   Amazon.
[01:17:11.020 --> 01:17:12.620]   Well, I wish them--
[01:17:12.620 --> 01:17:13.980]   Amazon has the closest--
[01:17:13.980 --> 01:17:16.020]   Amazon has the closest wallboard in to what Apple wants.
[01:17:16.020 --> 01:17:17.300]   Amazon's terrifying.
[01:17:17.300 --> 01:17:17.860]   It's--
[01:17:17.860 --> 01:17:19.780]   If you think Apple's bad, Amazon's terrifying.
[01:17:19.780 --> 01:17:22.500]   But Amazon's figured out a way to get away from that 30%.
[01:17:22.500 --> 01:17:24.780]   They side load some of the apps.
[01:17:24.780 --> 01:17:26.220]   At least, I don't know if they still do, but--
[01:17:26.220 --> 01:17:29.540]   No, if you're looking at the Kindle app on iOS
[01:17:29.540 --> 01:17:31.460]   or the Audible app, which is also--
[01:17:31.460 --> 01:17:33.780]   You can't buy books or music.
[01:17:33.780 --> 01:17:34.280]   Right.
[01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:35.900]   You can't buy the music that way.
[01:17:35.900 --> 01:17:38.180]   You have to go to your browser by there.
[01:17:38.180 --> 01:17:38.860]   Exactly.
[01:17:38.860 --> 01:17:40.580]   And that's what Spotify's done.
[01:17:40.580 --> 01:17:43.300]   And that's what Netflix is doing now.
[01:17:43.300 --> 01:17:45.700]   Netflix says we paid--
[01:17:45.700 --> 01:17:46.860]   this is going to save us-- what was it?
[01:17:46.860 --> 01:17:52.300]   $8 or $9 billion a year, but not paying the Apple 30%.
[01:17:52.300 --> 01:17:52.980]   Right.
[01:17:52.980 --> 01:17:57.700]   Now, what's fascinating to me is that in this sense,
[01:17:57.700 --> 01:18:00.780]   Apple is-- they're playing two roles.
[01:18:00.780 --> 01:18:03.620]   One is they're a payments processor.
[01:18:03.620 --> 01:18:07.700]   So they're sort of like MasterCard and Visa,
[01:18:07.700 --> 01:18:09.780]   although they have MasterCard and Visa
[01:18:09.780 --> 01:18:11.540]   as their partners as well.
[01:18:11.540 --> 01:18:13.540]   So they're layered on top of that.
[01:18:13.540 --> 01:18:17.700]   And they're also running some of the infrastructure
[01:18:17.700 --> 01:18:22.940]   for selling and servicing and updating the apps there.
[01:18:22.940 --> 01:18:29.340]   So those are two things that are of value to any provider.
[01:18:29.340 --> 01:18:33.700]   The real problem seems to be the arbitrary nature
[01:18:33.700 --> 01:18:39.900]   of the 30% fee and how it's 30% or nothing.
[01:18:39.900 --> 01:18:40.220]   And so--
[01:18:40.220 --> 01:18:42.620]   On subscriptions, this was a recent change.
[01:18:42.620 --> 01:18:45.820]   Down to 15% now after the second year in the same year.
[01:18:45.820 --> 01:18:48.780]   And that, I think, is to bring it back
[01:18:48.780 --> 01:18:51.300]   to what tomorrow's thing is going to be.
[01:18:51.300 --> 01:18:56.540]   This is yet another way for them to sort of ease off
[01:18:56.540 --> 01:19:00.140]   on the 30%.
[01:19:00.140 --> 01:19:03.340]   It still makes significant revenue on it,
[01:19:03.340 --> 01:19:06.940]   but allow some of the other players
[01:19:06.940 --> 01:19:11.540]   to participate more fully in the revenue stream.
[01:19:11.540 --> 01:19:13.580]   I'm going to watch for tomorrow.
[01:19:13.580 --> 01:19:15.140]   And it will be a little side note,
[01:19:15.140 --> 01:19:17.260]   but it might be the most important thing Apple announces
[01:19:17.260 --> 01:19:18.220]   tomorrow.
[01:19:18.220 --> 01:19:21.380]   Apple is doing a credit card with Goldman Sachs.
[01:19:21.380 --> 01:19:24.460]   And I think that's the real play here,
[01:19:24.460 --> 01:19:29.380]   because it's one thing to sell music or rent storage space
[01:19:29.380 --> 01:19:31.020]   or offer TV shows.
[01:19:31.020 --> 01:19:33.300]   It's another thing entirely to take a cut
[01:19:33.300 --> 01:19:35.820]   of every transaction on the platform.
[01:19:35.820 --> 01:19:37.860]   And that's ultimately what Apple's going to do.
[01:19:37.860 --> 01:19:39.460]   In fact, Apple--
[01:19:39.460 --> 01:19:41.620]   Goldman Sachs, their partner in this,
[01:19:41.620 --> 01:19:44.460]   also has a bank, an online bank.
[01:19:44.460 --> 01:19:47.100]   And I would not be at all surprised for Apple
[01:19:47.100 --> 01:19:48.460]   to do financial services.
[01:19:48.460 --> 01:19:51.620]   And at that point, that really is a walled garden.
[01:19:51.620 --> 01:19:53.380]   That is absolute lock-in.
[01:19:53.380 --> 01:19:55.020]   I mean, it fits their business model.
[01:19:55.020 --> 01:19:58.020]   They've always been about owning the core technologies
[01:19:58.020 --> 01:19:58.980]   behind their products.
[01:19:58.980 --> 01:20:01.860]   And if they are now a financial services company,
[01:20:01.860 --> 01:20:03.700]   yeah, I mean, it doesn't make sense for them
[01:20:03.700 --> 01:20:04.620]   to be paying that percentage.
[01:20:04.620 --> 01:20:06.340]   Apple pay, they get a smaller cut
[01:20:06.340 --> 01:20:07.780]   than they would as a credit card, right?
[01:20:07.780 --> 01:20:08.780]   They get a bigger cut.
[01:20:08.780 --> 01:20:10.620]   Of course, if you get Apple pay, plus the credit card,
[01:20:10.620 --> 01:20:11.820]   you get even more.
[01:20:11.820 --> 01:20:14.180]   I think that's the announcement to watch for tomorrow.
[01:20:14.180 --> 01:20:16.380]   So that will make-- I get an April Fool's story about Apple
[01:20:16.380 --> 01:20:18.020]   and the health insurance, who has never
[01:20:18.020 --> 01:20:18.580]   veered the go.
[01:20:18.580 --> 01:20:19.980]   It's not an April Fool!
[01:20:19.980 --> 01:20:21.780]   And it's not as good.
[01:20:21.780 --> 01:20:24.060]   The idea was that Apple would have insurance.
[01:20:24.060 --> 01:20:26.980]   And the reason it would work is because the demographic
[01:20:26.980 --> 01:20:29.580]   of people who own Apple equipment are actually probably
[01:20:29.580 --> 01:20:31.460]   ones that you could sell the insurance to a little bit
[01:20:31.460 --> 01:20:32.460]   cheaper and still make money.
[01:20:32.460 --> 01:20:33.660]   But it was a joke.
[01:20:33.660 --> 01:20:35.340]   But now you're telling me it may not be a joke.
[01:20:35.340 --> 01:20:36.740]   Yeah, and I'm not talking about--
[01:20:36.740 --> 01:20:39.140]   Google did this a branded credit card.
[01:20:39.140 --> 01:20:41.020]   Somebody else was running the credit card.
[01:20:41.020 --> 01:20:41.820]   It's my understanding.
[01:20:41.820 --> 01:20:42.620]   We'll see tomorrow.
[01:20:42.620 --> 01:20:43.780]   And maybe it won't become clear.
[01:20:43.780 --> 01:20:45.540]   But they will announce a credit card tomorrow.
[01:20:45.540 --> 01:20:47.340]   And I think it will not be a branded credit card,
[01:20:47.340 --> 01:20:49.900]   but it will actually be Apple financial services.
[01:20:49.900 --> 01:20:53.100]   And will you get Apple goodies and exchange--
[01:20:53.100 --> 01:20:54.100]   Of course you will.
[01:20:54.100 --> 01:20:55.900]   Yeah, you'll get set of points back.
[01:20:55.900 --> 01:20:57.860]   You'll get points towards an iPhone or an iPhone.
[01:20:57.860 --> 01:20:58.340]   Play's right.
[01:20:58.340 --> 01:21:00.260]   Yeah, right.
[01:21:00.260 --> 01:21:02.580]   And it will be made out of titanium and unicorn's blood.
[01:21:02.580 --> 01:21:03.740]   Oh, it'll be--
[01:21:03.740 --> 01:21:05.420]   I'll definitely have a gold card.
[01:21:05.420 --> 01:21:07.660]   Well, and of course you'll use it on the phone.
[01:21:07.660 --> 01:21:10.100]   Gold or rose gold.
[01:21:10.100 --> 01:21:11.540]   I want the Apple rose gold card.
[01:21:11.540 --> 01:21:13.820]   You ask when you go to a grocery store, you go to Safely.
[01:21:13.820 --> 01:21:14.860]   I use Apple Pay on the phone.
[01:21:14.860 --> 01:21:18.420]   I never use my credit cards anymore until they don't work.
[01:21:18.420 --> 01:21:20.780]   I mean, Apple sold this as being faster.
[01:21:20.780 --> 01:21:22.780]   It's exactly the same as pulling out a credit card
[01:21:22.780 --> 01:21:23.780]   still under the numbers.
[01:21:23.780 --> 01:21:24.500]   Yeah, it's more fun.
[01:21:24.500 --> 01:21:25.660]   Sometimes you have to sign.
[01:21:25.660 --> 01:21:26.820]   Like I use the Apple Watch.
[01:21:26.820 --> 01:21:28.580]   What do you make me sign for?
[01:21:28.580 --> 01:21:30.020]   This is not security.
[01:21:30.020 --> 01:21:32.340]   What is this?
[01:21:32.340 --> 01:21:33.220]   Yeah, it's fun.
[01:21:33.220 --> 01:21:35.140]   And at first I didn't use it because people
[01:21:35.140 --> 01:21:36.060]   gave you a funny look.
[01:21:36.060 --> 01:21:37.620]   The clerk would say, what?
[01:21:37.620 --> 01:21:39.340]   But now it's so accepted.
[01:21:39.340 --> 01:21:39.820]   Right.
[01:21:39.820 --> 01:21:41.460]   In fact, it's worse when I go to Whole Foods.
[01:21:41.460 --> 01:21:43.300]   Now I have to open my phone up and show them
[01:21:43.300 --> 01:21:45.980]   the Amazon Prime QR code.
[01:21:45.980 --> 01:21:48.460]   So I use Google Pay.
[01:21:48.460 --> 01:21:50.420]   And what I like about Google Pay, if you get an instant
[01:21:50.420 --> 01:21:52.220]   receipt, Google will offend you.
[01:21:52.220 --> 01:21:53.620]   I think Apple theme does well.
[01:21:53.620 --> 01:21:54.700]   I'm sure that's true.
[01:21:54.700 --> 01:21:57.740]   I use this thing for payments.
[01:21:57.740 --> 01:22:00.020]   It's called Euro.
[01:22:00.020 --> 01:22:01.020]   Euro.
[01:22:01.020 --> 01:22:02.380]   Yes, Euro.
[01:22:02.380 --> 01:22:04.540]   Actually, it's amazing how many things I have to do
[01:22:04.540 --> 01:22:06.660]   that I can't do electronically.
[01:22:06.660 --> 01:22:09.020]   They just don't-- God bless Italy.
[01:22:09.020 --> 01:22:10.380]   I'm serious.
[01:22:10.380 --> 01:22:11.940]   It barely works.
[01:22:11.940 --> 01:22:14.740]   The only place my credit cards work in Rome
[01:22:14.740 --> 01:22:15.860]   are at the McDonald's.
[01:22:15.860 --> 01:22:16.180]   Yeah.
[01:22:16.180 --> 01:22:17.660]   Which, yeah, yeah.
[01:22:17.660 --> 01:22:19.020]   Sometimes I want something other--
[01:22:19.020 --> 01:22:20.660]   You have a craving for a big Mac.
[01:22:20.660 --> 01:22:23.140]   I don't like the burgers, but I do like chicken nuggets
[01:22:23.140 --> 01:22:24.340]   every once in a while.
[01:22:24.340 --> 01:22:27.940]   When we were in Japan, we went to a lovely bento restaurant.
[01:22:27.940 --> 01:22:30.220]   Each of us, Lisa, our 16-year-old,
[01:22:30.220 --> 01:22:32.540]   and I had a lovely bento box.
[01:22:32.540 --> 01:22:35.740]   They slowly pushed their bento box over to me.
[01:22:35.740 --> 01:22:37.260]   I ate all three of them.
[01:22:37.260 --> 01:22:39.460]   And then we went next door to MacDee's.
[01:22:39.460 --> 01:22:43.340]   It's only the thing I can afford. Everything in Rome is so expensive.
[01:22:43.340 --> 01:22:44.420]   I want sushi, but that's--
[01:22:44.420 --> 01:22:44.780]   But wait a minute.
[01:22:44.780 --> 01:22:47.100]   Your restaurants are still cheaper than our restaurants.
[01:22:47.100 --> 01:22:47.980]   This is true.
[01:22:47.980 --> 01:22:48.660]   This is true.
[01:22:48.660 --> 01:22:50.180]   You get a better Italian meal in Italy.
[01:22:50.180 --> 01:22:51.500]   We have great coffee.
[01:22:51.500 --> 01:22:52.220]   I'm keto now.
[01:22:52.220 --> 01:22:53.620]   I can't go to Italy.
[01:22:53.620 --> 01:22:55.220]   I'm actually not allowed.
[01:22:55.220 --> 01:22:56.700]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:22:56.700 --> 01:22:58.140]   I can't even go to the order.
[01:22:58.140 --> 01:22:59.140]   No.
[01:22:59.140 --> 01:22:59.780]   I say, no.
[01:22:59.780 --> 01:23:00.060]   Sorry.
[01:23:00.060 --> 01:23:01.260]   You cannot go to Italy.
[01:23:01.260 --> 01:23:02.700]   It's not allowed.
[01:23:02.700 --> 01:23:05.780]   Our show today brought to you by Atlassian.
[01:23:05.780 --> 01:23:07.660]   Oh, we are at Atlassian house.
[01:23:07.660 --> 01:23:09.780]   And I'm proud to say those words.
[01:23:09.780 --> 01:23:12.580]   It all started for us with Atlassian's Jiro,
[01:23:12.580 --> 01:23:14.180]   which is an agile development tool.
[01:23:14.180 --> 01:23:15.660]   And developers know it very well.
[01:23:15.660 --> 01:23:16.740]   But we use it for projects.
[01:23:16.740 --> 01:23:19.500]   So we always know who's working on what stage they're in,
[01:23:19.500 --> 01:23:21.100]   what resources they need.
[01:23:21.100 --> 01:23:25.420]   And it's so satisfying when you get to move that project
[01:23:25.420 --> 01:23:26.700]   into the completed column.
[01:23:26.700 --> 01:23:28.420]   There's just something that's great about that.
[01:23:28.420 --> 01:23:31.380]   It also works with Confluence, another Atlassian product.
[01:23:31.380 --> 01:23:33.580]   That's really important for us because we use Confluence
[01:23:33.580 --> 01:23:36.580]   to document what the team's doing.
[01:23:36.580 --> 01:23:37.900]   So we use it in IT.
[01:23:37.900 --> 01:23:39.260]   I think it's a great IT tool.
[01:23:39.260 --> 01:23:40.820]   I know it's a great IT tool.
[01:23:40.820 --> 01:23:42.980]   Between Jira and Confluence, we know what's going on,
[01:23:42.980 --> 01:23:43.900]   who's doing it.
[01:23:43.900 --> 01:23:44.900]   We know how they did it.
[01:23:44.900 --> 01:23:47.380]   We know what the workflow is.
[01:23:47.380 --> 01:23:50.660]   IT, it turns out, is empowering business these days.
[01:23:50.660 --> 01:23:53.820]   Not just a podcast network, but pretty much any business
[01:23:53.820 --> 01:23:54.580]   there is.
[01:23:54.580 --> 01:23:57.100]   Atlassian is a collaboration software company
[01:23:57.100 --> 01:24:01.820]   that empowers IT teams around the world.
[01:24:01.820 --> 01:24:04.820]   IT is at the center of almost everything going on.
[01:24:04.820 --> 01:24:08.060]   In a cloud-based world, it's IT teams that plan and execute.
[01:24:08.060 --> 01:24:10.460]   And they've got to do it faster and better than ever.
[01:24:10.460 --> 01:24:13.420]   Incidents require open, agile, and smart cooperation
[01:24:13.420 --> 01:24:16.620]   between ops and software development teams.
[01:24:16.620 --> 01:24:17.980]   The expectations are high.
[01:24:17.980 --> 01:24:19.380]   The stakes are high.
[01:24:19.380 --> 01:24:22.540]   IT is right at the heart of that.
[01:24:22.540 --> 01:24:25.060]   If you're in a business critical workflow,
[01:24:25.060 --> 01:24:27.500]   failure is not an option.
[01:24:27.500 --> 01:24:29.220]   But the great thing about Atlassian
[01:24:29.220 --> 01:24:30.620]   is it's not just for developers.
[01:24:30.620 --> 01:24:33.740]   They offer an affordable, reliable suite of tools
[01:24:33.740 --> 01:24:38.740]   for IT teams of all sizes, from DevOps to Agile to IT apps
[01:24:38.740 --> 01:24:41.940]   to ops to ITSM and whatever is next.
[01:24:41.940 --> 01:24:44.020]   They give you the technology backbone
[01:24:44.020 --> 01:24:47.860]   you need for planning, service, and supporting
[01:24:47.860 --> 01:24:51.660]   the kind of change that propels business.
[01:24:51.660 --> 01:24:52.740]   So I mentioned JIRA.
[01:24:52.740 --> 01:24:53.780]   I mentioned Confluence.
[01:24:53.780 --> 01:24:56.460]   If you've got a code base, there's Bitbucket.
[01:24:56.460 --> 01:24:59.940]   If you've got ops, there's ops Genie and status page.
[01:24:59.940 --> 01:25:01.700]   That'll help you better detect incidents,
[01:25:01.700 --> 01:25:04.140]   coordinate response efforts, resolve issues,
[01:25:04.140 --> 01:25:06.300]   faster keep customers or stakeholders updated.
[01:25:06.300 --> 01:25:09.580]   And I love it that Atlassian is always adding new tools.
[01:25:09.580 --> 01:25:11.100]   So they all work together.
[01:25:11.100 --> 01:25:14.100]   They all kind of, you know, they're jigsaw puzzle pieces
[01:25:14.100 --> 01:25:15.900]   that all fit together, things like Trello.
[01:25:15.900 --> 01:25:19.300]   And it all integrates seamlessly with JIRA and Confluence.
[01:25:19.300 --> 01:25:23.380]   So your team can stay on one platform and get it all done.
[01:25:23.380 --> 01:25:26.380]   And most importantly, can keep stakeholders,
[01:25:26.380 --> 01:25:29.820]   customers, coworkers informed up to date
[01:25:29.820 --> 01:25:31.580]   on what's going on.
[01:25:31.580 --> 01:25:35.660]   You want a high performing IT team you want Atlassian.
[01:25:35.660 --> 01:25:38.180]   Like all of Atlassian's products, the tools for your IT team
[01:25:38.180 --> 01:25:41.940]   are easy, they're free to try, and you've got to go right now.
[01:25:41.940 --> 01:25:42.780]   There it is, all of it.
[01:25:42.780 --> 01:25:43.780]   Look at all this stuff.
[01:25:43.780 --> 01:25:46.820]   Atlassian.com/IT.
[01:25:46.820 --> 01:25:48.820]   Atlassian.com/IT.

[01:25:51.140 --> 01:25:52.420]   Try them all.
[01:25:52.420 --> 01:25:55.100]   You could try them for free and really put together
[01:25:55.100 --> 01:25:59.020]   a suite of tools that supports your IT team.
[01:25:59.020 --> 01:26:07.220]   Try Atlassian today to see what IT can be at lassian.com/IT.
[01:26:07.220 --> 01:26:11.140]   So I came in early on--
[01:26:11.140 --> 01:26:15.340]   was it Tuesday or Wednesday to see the Google GDC announcement?
[01:26:15.340 --> 01:26:21.460]   It was Tuesday, 10 AM at the Game Developers Conference.
[01:26:21.460 --> 01:26:22.820]   We knew that Google was probably going
[01:26:22.820 --> 01:26:25.300]   to announce a streaming gaming service.
[01:26:25.300 --> 01:26:26.900]   They tried Project Stream.
[01:26:26.900 --> 01:26:30.460]   They'd showed people you could play Assassin's Creed Odyssey
[01:26:30.460 --> 01:26:33.620]   and a browser on a Chrome device, Chrome OS device.
[01:26:33.620 --> 01:26:35.140]   We thought that was pretty cool.
[01:26:35.140 --> 01:26:37.100]   They announced Stadia.
[01:26:37.100 --> 01:26:41.420]   And I have to admit, I bet this happens to you too.
[01:26:41.420 --> 01:26:44.340]   Maybe not Ed, because Ed is a hard-headed cynic.
[01:26:44.340 --> 01:26:47.500]   But when I watch these keynotes, I get all excited.
[01:26:47.500 --> 01:26:49.620]   I say, oh, this is going to be the greatest thing ever.
[01:26:49.620 --> 01:26:52.700]   They showed how YouTube will be the heart of this,
[01:26:52.700 --> 01:26:55.780]   that you could stream gameplay on YouTube,
[01:26:55.780 --> 01:26:58.540]   and there'd be a button on there that said to the viewer,
[01:26:58.540 --> 01:27:00.060]   come on, play the game too.
[01:27:00.060 --> 01:27:02.140]   You can join the game at the same point.
[01:27:02.140 --> 01:27:05.180]   You'd be able to save game states and share them
[01:27:05.180 --> 01:27:08.700]   so they could join the game right at the most critical part.
[01:27:08.700 --> 01:27:11.060]   They showed how you could play on devices
[01:27:11.060 --> 01:27:16.060]   as dumb as a Chromecast Ultra of $75 dongle.
[01:27:16.060 --> 01:27:18.020]   You plug into your TV, and suddenly you
[01:27:18.020 --> 01:27:21.540]   get the Google joystick, which, by the way, brilliantly,
[01:27:21.540 --> 01:27:22.940]   worked just like Chromecast.
[01:27:22.940 --> 01:27:24.420]   It didn't connect to the dongle.
[01:27:24.420 --> 01:27:27.580]   It connected via Wi-Fi to the Stadia Cloud.
[01:27:27.580 --> 01:27:29.300]   They showed how they would have backbones.
[01:27:29.300 --> 01:27:33.260]   It had custom-designed AMD GPUs that were working
[01:27:33.260 --> 01:27:37.660]   at 10 teraflops faster than a PlayStation 4 Pro or an Xbox One
[01:27:37.660 --> 01:27:39.420]   X. I got so excited.
[01:27:39.420 --> 01:27:41.860]   I said, take my money, Google.
[01:27:41.860 --> 01:27:43.660]   And they said, well, no, we don't know what it's going to cost
[01:27:43.660 --> 01:27:44.860]   or when it's going to be available.
[01:27:44.860 --> 01:27:45.420]   So thank you very much.
[01:27:45.420 --> 01:27:46.700]   And actually, breaking news, Google
[01:27:46.700 --> 01:27:50.580]   just announced that they're going to be killing Stadia in 2023.
[01:27:50.580 --> 01:27:52.020]   So just a point of time.
[01:27:52.020 --> 01:27:55.220]   It reminded me, I remember when Steve Perlman, who
[01:27:55.220 --> 01:27:59.060]   was the founder of Web TV, going on live.
[01:27:59.060 --> 01:28:00.260]   I'm looking at an article--
[01:28:00.260 --> 01:28:02.220]   I guess it died around 2012.
[01:28:02.220 --> 01:28:03.780]   But that was an early example.
[01:28:03.780 --> 01:28:06.260]   And I was blown away at the time, because that was his pitch
[01:28:06.260 --> 01:28:06.580]   as well.
[01:28:06.580 --> 01:28:07.180]   You could take a campaign.
[01:28:07.180 --> 01:28:07.700]   That's the irony of this.
[01:28:07.700 --> 01:28:08.580]   This is nothing new.
[01:28:08.580 --> 01:28:09.780]   Nothing new at all.
[01:28:09.780 --> 01:28:12.140]   On live failed because they realized
[01:28:12.140 --> 01:28:16.780]   that they had enough hardware for the peak times a day.
[01:28:16.780 --> 01:28:19.100]   But it would lie foul almost all the rest of the time.
[01:28:19.100 --> 01:28:20.180]   It's like the electrical grid.
[01:28:20.180 --> 01:28:21.260]   Yeah, they couldn't afford it.
[01:28:21.260 --> 01:28:22.060]   Yeah.
[01:28:22.060 --> 01:28:24.540]   They sold their IP, I think, to Sony.
[01:28:24.540 --> 01:28:25.820]   Sony also bought Guy Kai.
[01:28:25.820 --> 01:28:28.380]   Sony is going to have a streaming gaming service.
[01:28:28.380 --> 01:28:29.700]   Microsoft is announced next year.
[01:28:29.700 --> 01:28:31.900]   They'll do a streaming gaming service.
[01:28:31.900 --> 01:28:32.900]   Shadow does this.
[01:28:32.900 --> 01:28:33.420]   Shadow.
[01:28:33.420 --> 01:28:34.260]   We have a shadow.
[01:28:34.260 --> 01:28:35.260]   That's pretty cool.
[01:28:35.260 --> 01:28:36.220]   Steam does this.
[01:28:36.220 --> 01:28:36.900]   Steam to go.
[01:28:36.900 --> 01:28:37.860]   You can stream.
[01:28:37.860 --> 01:28:40.020]   Microsoft does this with their Xbox anywhere.
[01:28:40.020 --> 01:28:43.020]   So it's not-- like you said, not new at all.
[01:28:43.020 --> 01:28:46.020]   I think they really want to push the YouTube integration.
[01:28:46.020 --> 01:28:46.420]   That whole--
[01:28:46.420 --> 01:28:48.020]   It's almost like a YouTube.
[01:28:48.020 --> 01:28:50.260]   It's almost like Twitch is eating on a lunch.
[01:28:50.260 --> 01:28:51.260]   Twitch, yeah.
[01:28:51.260 --> 01:28:51.620]   Yeah.
[01:28:51.620 --> 01:28:54.100]   Although they were quick to point out how many billions of hours
[01:28:54.100 --> 01:28:56.180]   people watch gaming on YouTube.
[01:28:56.180 --> 01:28:58.420]   But it's different because I know I watch my kid.
[01:28:58.420 --> 01:29:02.740]   He watches Minecraft videos, how-to videos.
[01:29:02.740 --> 01:29:05.140]   If he wants to play Overwatch, he'll watch the videos
[01:29:05.140 --> 01:29:07.180]   and learn and then play the game.
[01:29:07.180 --> 01:29:09.460]   People watch Twitch to watch live action.
[01:29:09.460 --> 01:29:11.780]   I think the name Stadia is also telling
[01:29:11.780 --> 01:29:13.620]   because it kind of implies a stadium.
[01:29:13.620 --> 01:29:14.980]   Like an e-sports kind of thing.
[01:29:14.980 --> 01:29:17.180]   It took me a long time to get my head around the idea
[01:29:17.180 --> 01:29:20.020]   that people would actually watch other people play games.
[01:29:20.020 --> 01:29:22.540]   Men have occurred to me, ESPN, sports.
[01:29:22.540 --> 01:29:24.260]   I mean, we've been doing that all our lives.
[01:29:24.260 --> 01:29:27.340]   You know when I turned to the corners of Fortnite?
[01:29:27.340 --> 01:29:30.100]   Because first of all, Fortnite has a feature
[01:29:30.100 --> 01:29:32.180]   that if you get killed, which I did almost instantly
[01:29:32.180 --> 01:29:33.860]   every single time, you can continue
[01:29:33.860 --> 01:29:35.860]   to follow the guy who killed you and then the guy who killed
[01:29:35.860 --> 01:29:37.380]   you and all the way up to the top.
[01:29:37.380 --> 01:29:38.900]   And it's fun.
[01:29:38.900 --> 01:29:42.060]   And then I watched-- it was a charity thing with Ninja
[01:29:42.060 --> 01:29:45.220]   and Marshmallow playing--
[01:29:45.220 --> 01:29:46.060]   Oh, the concert?
[01:29:46.060 --> 01:29:46.540]   Yeah.
[01:29:46.540 --> 01:29:47.580]   No, no, no, not the concert.
[01:29:47.580 --> 01:29:48.580]   He had a concert in Fortnite.
[01:29:48.580 --> 01:29:49.580]   That was another thing in time.
[01:29:49.580 --> 01:29:50.580]   But no, I watched them.
[01:29:50.580 --> 01:29:53.020]   It was at E3 last year.
[01:29:53.020 --> 01:29:55.220]   And it was really engaging and fun to watch.
[01:29:55.220 --> 01:29:56.820]   And the commentators were good.
[01:29:56.820 --> 01:29:59.740]   They have to work on the biggest problem they had is,
[01:29:59.740 --> 01:30:02.300]   they don't know as much about this as ESPN does about sports
[01:30:02.300 --> 01:30:04.460]   because they would always miss the kill shot.
[01:30:04.460 --> 01:30:05.140]   Like the--
[01:30:05.140 --> 01:30:05.660]   Oh, right.
[01:30:05.660 --> 01:30:06.380]   --it's go there.
[01:30:06.380 --> 01:30:09.700]   Oh, he just-- oh, I wish he could have seen that.
[01:30:09.700 --> 01:30:11.860]   But they'll get that down.
[01:30:11.860 --> 01:30:13.140]   I thought it was very engaging.
[01:30:13.140 --> 01:30:14.940]   So I do think it's fun to watch.
[01:30:14.940 --> 01:30:15.460]   Oh, yeah.
[01:30:15.460 --> 01:30:16.500]   It's the youg-- the youginess.
[01:30:16.500 --> 01:30:17.580]   And it's obviously huge already.
[01:30:17.580 --> 01:30:19.300]   People also watch people play poker.
[01:30:19.300 --> 01:30:20.300]   I mean, it's--
[01:30:20.300 --> 01:30:21.460]   Yeah, poker's fun to watch.
[01:30:21.460 --> 01:30:22.380]   Watch other people play games.
[01:30:22.380 --> 01:30:24.540]   You know why the whole card camera?
[01:30:24.540 --> 01:30:26.940]   It's a single thing that may poker big on TV.
[01:30:26.940 --> 01:30:28.860]   Because you know-- you have information
[01:30:28.860 --> 01:30:31.340]   the other players don't know if you know what hand is bit.
[01:30:31.340 --> 01:30:34.100]   I mean, it's not gaming per se.
[01:30:34.100 --> 01:30:36.180]   It's the same thing with poker or watching anything
[01:30:36.180 --> 01:30:38.540]   that's a sport that people don't care about.
[01:30:38.540 --> 01:30:39.620]   They're following the personality.
[01:30:39.620 --> 01:30:41.780]   It's the same reason why people watch a twit a lot.
[01:30:41.780 --> 01:30:43.940]   They love Leo.
[01:30:43.940 --> 01:30:45.300]   When you find someone who you--
[01:30:45.300 --> 01:30:45.780]   Or hate me.
[01:30:45.780 --> 01:30:46.700]   --interesting or hate me.
[01:30:46.700 --> 01:30:47.700]   Exactly.
[01:30:47.700 --> 01:30:49.020]   But you follow them.
[01:30:49.020 --> 01:30:49.660]   Yeah.
[01:30:49.660 --> 01:30:50.860]   On YouTube, it's the same thing.
[01:30:50.860 --> 01:30:54.100]   I've watched now hundreds of hours of gaming on YouTube
[01:30:54.100 --> 01:30:55.660]   because I made a conscious effort to dive.
[01:30:55.660 --> 01:30:57.300]   Do you watch live gaming on YouTube?
[01:30:57.300 --> 01:30:59.220]   I don't like the live gaming.
[01:30:59.220 --> 01:31:00.860]   Do you watch it on Twitch?
[01:31:00.860 --> 01:31:02.220]   I watch it on Twitch sometimes.
[01:31:02.220 --> 01:31:02.740]   But--
[01:31:02.740 --> 01:31:04.860]   And it's a community on Twitch because you get the chat.
[01:31:04.860 --> 01:31:07.340]   You got people giving money.
[01:31:07.340 --> 01:31:10.580]   Twitch, they've made it into something interesting,
[01:31:10.580 --> 01:31:11.780]   I think, very compelling.
[01:31:11.780 --> 01:31:13.420]   What do you think, Ed?
[01:31:13.420 --> 01:31:15.660]   Well, you know, I find it fascinating
[01:31:15.660 --> 01:31:18.140]   that Google doesn't break out how much money it
[01:31:18.140 --> 01:31:19.860]   makes from YouTube.
[01:31:19.860 --> 01:31:21.300]   You never do, do they?
[01:31:21.300 --> 01:31:22.580]   No, they never have.
[01:31:22.580 --> 01:31:23.900]   And so you don't know.
[01:31:23.900 --> 01:31:28.820]   But we're back to the thing we were talking about earlier,
[01:31:28.820 --> 01:31:32.500]   where Google is a company that has historically
[01:31:32.500 --> 01:31:35.540]   been driven completely by advertising revenue.
[01:31:35.540 --> 01:31:37.340]   And I think you're right on the money
[01:31:37.340 --> 01:31:41.820]   to say that this is an attempt to save YouTube,
[01:31:41.820 --> 01:31:43.420]   to transform YouTube.
[01:31:43.420 --> 01:31:47.300]   Because right now, YouTube's reputation is toxic.
[01:31:47.300 --> 01:31:47.820]   Right.
[01:31:47.820 --> 01:31:53.620]   And-- but everything in YouTube's business model, which
[01:31:53.620 --> 01:31:56.180]   is similar to Facebook's business model,
[01:31:56.180 --> 01:31:58.340]   is driven by engagement.
[01:31:58.340 --> 01:32:05.420]   And the things that make engagement go up
[01:32:05.420 --> 01:32:09.900]   are usually things that are shocking, violent,
[01:32:09.900 --> 01:32:11.180]   or controversial.
[01:32:11.180 --> 01:32:14.260]   You mean having people make pornographic comments
[01:32:14.260 --> 01:32:16.220]   on children's videos is something
[01:32:16.220 --> 01:32:19.540]   that you would find distasteful?
[01:32:19.540 --> 01:32:21.660]   For example, for example.
[01:32:21.660 --> 01:32:26.140]   And we could find several worse examples than that, even.
[01:32:26.140 --> 01:32:28.260]   That's pretty hard to find one worse than that.
[01:32:28.260 --> 01:32:30.540]   And that's saying something.
[01:32:30.540 --> 01:32:33.260]   But so the idea of turning it into--
[01:32:33.260 --> 01:32:37.580]   I mean, it's almost like they're trying to turn it into--
[01:32:37.580 --> 01:32:42.460]   they've tried to turn YouTube into a TV network
[01:32:42.460 --> 01:32:43.900]   for a while.
[01:32:43.900 --> 01:32:45.780]   And the difference is with TV networks, you actually have
[01:32:45.780 --> 01:32:48.060]   programmers, you actually have professionals who
[01:32:48.060 --> 01:32:51.780]   make editorial decisions for quality content.
[01:32:51.780 --> 01:32:54.820]   So the idea of mixing television and social networking
[01:32:54.820 --> 01:32:58.020]   is, imagine if NBC sort of turned over its airwaves one day
[01:32:58.020 --> 01:33:00.900]   and said, OK, anybody can program whatever they want.
[01:33:00.900 --> 01:33:01.980]   Yeah, we have that.
[01:33:01.980 --> 01:33:04.020]   It's called reality TV.
[01:33:04.020 --> 01:33:06.820]   And we have a president who did well at that.
[01:33:06.820 --> 01:33:08.180]   And that's the thing.
[01:33:08.180 --> 01:33:10.180]   When I figured out that it was about engagement,
[01:33:10.180 --> 01:33:13.700]   was when I saw streaming of a game called Rust, which
[01:33:13.700 --> 01:33:17.540]   is the most boring game ever, but I'm kind of addicted to it.
[01:33:17.540 --> 01:33:21.220]   Because of the fact that you had some very talented content
[01:33:21.220 --> 01:33:23.700]   creators who were turning it into a narrative.
[01:33:23.700 --> 01:33:25.580]   And that's why I like YouTube.
[01:33:25.580 --> 01:33:26.940]   It's a bit more finish than Twitch.
[01:33:26.940 --> 01:33:28.580]   For a boring game, Rust.
[01:33:28.580 --> 01:33:29.580]   It really is.
[01:33:29.580 --> 01:33:31.540]   It really is.
[01:33:31.540 --> 01:33:33.260]   You sound like an old school guy.
[01:33:33.260 --> 01:33:33.820]   No.
[01:33:33.820 --> 01:33:35.580]   Because you say--
[01:33:35.580 --> 01:33:37.860]   you're going to need a professional announcer.
[01:33:37.860 --> 01:33:38.980]   Well, no, I'm not--
[01:33:38.980 --> 01:33:40.020]   I'm not--
[01:33:40.020 --> 01:33:40.260]   I think--
[01:33:40.260 --> 01:33:42.020]   Welcome to the 21st century.
[01:33:42.020 --> 01:33:43.340]   It's the age of the amateur.
[01:33:43.340 --> 01:33:45.420]   Leo, there's some amazing content on YouTube.
[01:33:45.420 --> 01:33:47.740]   And there are a lot of millionaires on YouTube
[01:33:47.740 --> 01:33:51.180]   who did very well exploiting that media better
[01:33:51.180 --> 01:33:54.500]   than most professional actors and producers and directors
[01:33:54.500 --> 01:33:56.340]   have done doing professional media.
[01:33:56.340 --> 01:33:58.540]   I mean, still, the big bucks are in professionally produced
[01:33:58.540 --> 01:33:59.980]   television and movies.
[01:33:59.980 --> 01:34:00.940]   But the point is--
[01:34:00.940 --> 01:34:03.020]   The kids today are watching the YouTube.
[01:34:03.020 --> 01:34:04.180]   That's right.
[01:34:04.180 --> 01:34:07.060]   In fact, I just saw a stat that there's more--
[01:34:07.060 --> 01:34:10.820]   YouTube's easily, handily beating cable TV.
[01:34:10.820 --> 01:34:11.900]   And people under 25.
[01:34:11.900 --> 01:34:13.060]   I can't remember the exact numbers.
[01:34:13.060 --> 01:34:15.660]   But it's not a competition anymore.
[01:34:15.660 --> 01:34:16.460]   It's not even close.
[01:34:16.460 --> 01:34:17.700]   Not even close.
[01:34:17.700 --> 01:34:23.660]   But I'd be curious to know that the one metric is how many
[01:34:23.660 --> 01:34:26.260]   people are watching it and how much time they're watching it.
[01:34:26.260 --> 01:34:29.100]   But the other metric that matters in terms of it being
[01:34:29.100 --> 01:34:32.620]   a sustainable business is how are they monetizing it?
[01:34:32.620 --> 01:34:33.860]   Well, and I agree with you, Ed.
[01:34:33.860 --> 01:34:35.340]   I mean, the problem YouTube has it--
[01:34:35.340 --> 01:34:37.860]   reputationally is-- it's a dung heap.
[01:34:37.860 --> 01:34:38.820]   Well, that was my point.
[01:34:38.820 --> 01:34:40.300]   Ed bringing up the issue of the reputation.
[01:34:40.300 --> 01:34:42.540]   But it's not the quality of the video, as bad as that is.
[01:34:42.540 --> 01:34:43.040]   Right.
[01:34:43.040 --> 01:34:43.860]   It's the comments.
[01:34:43.860 --> 01:34:44.860]   But that's--
[01:34:44.860 --> 01:34:46.860]   And the environment that's bad.
[01:34:46.860 --> 01:34:50.220]   And it's bad because advertisers are terrified of having
[01:34:50.220 --> 01:34:52.660]   an ad appear next to something--
[01:34:52.660 --> 01:34:53.340]   Disgusting.
[01:34:53.340 --> 01:34:54.580]   Disgusting.
[01:34:54.580 --> 01:35:00.140]   And the recommendation algorithm that leads you into the
[01:35:00.140 --> 01:35:01.100]   darkest worst--
[01:35:01.100 --> 01:35:04.700]   That's a spectacular failure on Google.
[01:35:04.700 --> 01:35:07.220]   Which is why some of the biggest YouTubers, the ones who
[01:35:07.220 --> 01:35:09.620]   are actually making money on this, are no longer really
[01:35:09.620 --> 01:35:12.020]   depending on the monetization through YouTube.
[01:35:12.020 --> 01:35:12.860]   They use Patreon.
[01:35:12.860 --> 01:35:15.340]   Yeah, Lilly Singh makes her money selling baskets of goods.
[01:35:15.340 --> 01:35:15.820]   Precisely.
[01:35:15.820 --> 01:35:18.420]   And you can just ignore the comments, or you can turn
[01:35:18.420 --> 01:35:19.700]   them off.
[01:35:19.700 --> 01:35:24.020]   This is a study from Nielsen.
[01:35:24.020 --> 01:35:27.500]   They're Q3 2018 Total Audience Report.
[01:35:27.500 --> 01:35:31.100]   Mobile time is mobile, but I think mobile, as you know, is
[01:35:31.100 --> 01:35:33.780]   where all the growth is happening.
[01:35:33.780 --> 01:35:36.060]   40% of all more mobile traffic.
[01:35:36.060 --> 01:35:40.340]   40% of all mobile traffic is YouTube.
[01:35:40.340 --> 01:35:41.540]   That makes sense.
[01:35:41.540 --> 01:35:43.260]   40-- let me say that again.
[01:35:43.260 --> 01:35:44.900]   40% is--
[01:35:44.900 --> 01:35:47.340]   Is that measuring in bytes, hours?
[01:35:47.340 --> 01:35:48.740]   What do they measure again?
[01:35:48.740 --> 01:35:49.340]   Time spent.
[01:35:49.340 --> 01:35:49.780]   Time spent.
[01:35:49.780 --> 01:35:50.780]   OK.
[01:35:50.780 --> 01:35:52.660]   10% is Netflix.
[01:35:52.660 --> 01:35:54.260]   10% Facebook.
[01:35:54.260 --> 01:35:56.220]   40% YouTube.
[01:35:56.220 --> 01:36:00.980]   So however we feel about YouTube, clearly it's got
[01:36:00.980 --> 01:36:02.860]   people's attention.
[01:36:02.860 --> 01:36:06.420]   But isn't that the way YouTube is designed?
[01:36:06.420 --> 01:36:10.100]   You watch a video, and then boom, the next one is cute up
[01:36:10.100 --> 01:36:11.700]   and starts playing automatically.
[01:36:11.700 --> 01:36:14.500]   And then boom, the next one is cute up.
[01:36:14.500 --> 01:36:19.700]   And that's the secret of their success, which is people
[01:36:19.700 --> 01:36:22.020]   spend a lot of time on it, because you start out just
[01:36:22.020 --> 01:36:25.940]   watching a picture of pets in Halloween costumes.
[01:36:25.940 --> 01:36:32.380]   And pretty soon, you're watching Flat Earth videos.
[01:36:32.380 --> 01:36:33.380]   Yeah, that's the real problem.
[01:36:33.380 --> 01:36:34.060]   Did you see that?
[01:36:34.060 --> 01:36:37.860]   Almost all the people who believe in the Flat Earth today
[01:36:37.860 --> 01:36:39.580]   got it from YouTube.
[01:36:39.580 --> 01:36:41.180]   That's from a lot of--
[01:36:41.180 --> 01:36:42.020]   I take it back.
[01:36:42.020 --> 01:36:43.380]   It is--
[01:36:43.380 --> 01:36:46.140]   I'm gathering-- this is from Sandvine, that it's data.
[01:36:46.140 --> 01:36:48.980]   Because global downstream mobile traffic by app.
[01:36:48.980 --> 01:36:51.460]   So that's YouTube of the total.
[01:36:51.460 --> 01:36:57.140]   By the way, YouTube, 37% web browsing, 4.6%.
[01:36:57.140 --> 01:36:59.260]   People don't even browse the web on this stuff.
[01:36:59.260 --> 01:36:59.860]   What's app?
[01:36:59.860 --> 01:37:01.460]   3.7%.
[01:37:01.460 --> 01:37:03.380]   App Store and Google Play?
[01:37:03.380 --> 01:37:04.980]   2.1% and 1.9%.
[01:37:04.980 --> 01:37:05.700]   I'm surprised.
[01:37:05.700 --> 01:37:06.820]   Is that 3.7?
[01:37:06.820 --> 01:37:08.940]   What the heck are people transferring over with the set?
[01:37:08.940 --> 01:37:12.140]   No, no, that's because everywhere but the US,
[01:37:12.140 --> 01:37:14.460]   WhatsApp is the choice of messaging app.
[01:37:14.460 --> 01:37:16.500]   So they're spending all day on WhatsApp.
[01:37:16.500 --> 01:37:18.100]   Maybe they're sending pictures.
[01:37:18.100 --> 01:37:21.540]   Instagram 5.7, Snapchat 8.3.
[01:37:21.540 --> 01:37:23.260]   Well, but not by relative to YouTube.
[01:37:23.260 --> 01:37:24.820]   YouTube dominates.
[01:37:24.820 --> 01:37:29.780]   Well, what I don't understand about that is, OK, let's say
[01:37:29.780 --> 01:37:34.220]   that I spend an hour staring at my phone screen as I talk
[01:37:34.220 --> 01:37:35.100]   with people--
[01:37:35.100 --> 01:37:35.860]   What if we came?
[01:37:35.860 --> 01:37:36.860]   WhatsApp.
[01:37:36.860 --> 01:37:38.180]   On WhatsApp.
[01:37:38.180 --> 01:37:39.180]   Yes.
[01:37:39.180 --> 01:37:43.300]   And then I spend an hour watching one video
[01:37:43.300 --> 01:37:45.140]   after another on YouTube.
[01:37:45.140 --> 01:37:49.940]   I mean, those YouTube videos are significantly more data.
[01:37:49.940 --> 01:37:51.740]   Yeah, maybe they're just running in the background
[01:37:51.740 --> 01:37:53.540]   while you're doing something else.
[01:37:53.540 --> 01:37:56.620]   Well, no, I'm just saying that an hour of WhatsApp
[01:37:56.620 --> 01:37:57.500]   is going to use--
[01:37:57.500 --> 01:37:58.260]   It's much smaller.
[01:37:58.260 --> 01:37:59.380]   Much less data.
[01:37:59.380 --> 01:38:00.140]   So you're right.
[01:38:00.140 --> 01:38:04.380]   I'd rather see time spent viewing than data.
[01:38:04.380 --> 01:38:06.020]   You're absolutely right.
[01:38:06.020 --> 01:38:07.580]   Sandvine gets the data.
[01:38:07.580 --> 01:38:09.300]   You could make an app.
[01:38:09.300 --> 01:38:11.580]   You could make a living off of creating an app that just
[01:38:11.580 --> 01:38:12.740]   does curated content.
[01:38:12.740 --> 01:38:15.020]   You don't create any content of your own.
[01:38:15.020 --> 01:38:17.020]   You promise your viewers that they're only
[01:38:17.020 --> 01:38:18.860]   going to get content that's high quality.
[01:38:18.860 --> 01:38:19.340]   You think so?
[01:38:19.340 --> 01:38:21.220]   Because we've been saying that for years.
[01:38:21.220 --> 01:38:23.700]   That curation was the real skill.
[01:38:23.700 --> 01:38:24.580]   No one's really done it.
[01:38:24.580 --> 01:38:25.660]   I mean, we have playlists.
[01:38:25.660 --> 01:38:28.180]   But to actually make a concentrated effort to say,
[01:38:28.180 --> 01:38:30.500]   look, you grant our service.
[01:38:30.500 --> 01:38:32.060]   It runs on your Roku stick.
[01:38:32.060 --> 01:38:34.740]   And you will only get YouTube videos that actually
[01:38:34.740 --> 01:38:35.500]   make sense for you.
[01:38:35.500 --> 01:38:36.740]   Yeah.
[01:38:36.740 --> 01:38:44.060]   So Stadia will come out sometime this year for a price unknown.
[01:38:44.060 --> 01:38:48.580]   As Carsten's son, a serious gamer, pointed out, who announces--
[01:38:48.580 --> 01:38:50.940]   OK, some flaws, some major flaws in the announcement.
[01:38:50.940 --> 01:38:52.780]   First of all, Satya Nadella comes out and says,
[01:38:52.780 --> 01:38:54.460]   I am not a gamer.
[01:38:54.460 --> 01:38:57.420]   OK, who does a game announcement at GDC starting,
[01:38:57.420 --> 01:38:58.460]   I'm not a gamer.
[01:38:58.460 --> 01:38:59.260]   That's bad.
[01:38:59.260 --> 01:39:02.740]   Two, literally the only game they announced on it
[01:39:02.740 --> 01:39:06.780]   is Doom, which is 30 years old.
[01:39:06.780 --> 01:39:07.940]   There's an updated Doom.
[01:39:07.940 --> 01:39:10.420]   Zoom, they're going to get Duke Nukem, which is exactly--
[01:39:10.420 --> 01:39:10.900]   Exactly.
[01:39:10.900 --> 01:39:11.740]   --exacting it is doomed.
[01:39:11.740 --> 01:39:12.580]   Exactly.
[01:39:12.580 --> 01:39:13.580]   I don't know.
[01:39:13.580 --> 01:39:14.100]   Come on.
[01:39:14.100 --> 01:39:16.460]   Without games, there's no point in playing a gaming service.
[01:39:16.460 --> 01:39:18.460]   They had no games to announce.
[01:39:18.460 --> 01:39:19.380]   They had no price.
[01:39:19.380 --> 01:39:20.980]   And look at what Apple does an announcement.
[01:39:20.980 --> 01:39:23.340]   They have the announcement of their developers standing up.
[01:39:23.340 --> 01:39:25.900]   They're showing off the cool things you can do with their product.
[01:39:25.900 --> 01:39:27.460]   They always announce the price.
[01:39:27.460 --> 01:39:29.500]   They always announce the date of availability.
[01:39:29.500 --> 01:39:30.540]   This was a little premature.
[01:39:30.540 --> 01:39:32.180]   Of course, it's at a game developers' conference.
[01:39:32.180 --> 01:39:35.620]   So they're trying to get developers to write games for it.
[01:39:35.620 --> 01:39:38.500]   Although if I'm a developer and Google comes to me and says,
[01:39:38.500 --> 01:39:41.020]   we got a new service, are you going to write for Google
[01:39:41.020 --> 01:39:43.820]   knowing that they could kill the service two years later?
[01:39:43.820 --> 01:39:46.540]   I mean, who trusts Google for that?
[01:39:46.540 --> 01:39:48.380]   I don't think it was a compelling pitch.
[01:39:48.380 --> 01:39:50.300]   And did Microsoft say that--
[01:39:50.300 --> 01:39:52.740]   didn't Microsoft say they're going to have their response
[01:39:52.740 --> 01:39:59.740]   to this in E3, which is just a little over two months away?
[01:39:59.740 --> 01:40:07.620]   And that will undoubtedly be before the widespread availability
[01:40:07.620 --> 01:40:10.340]   of Google Stadia.
[01:40:10.340 --> 01:40:14.860]   So I mean, it's a vaporware announcement, really.
[01:40:14.860 --> 01:40:16.100]   The ultimate.
[01:40:16.100 --> 01:40:16.780]   Classic.
[01:40:16.780 --> 01:40:19.460]   And then the final point of all this,
[01:40:19.460 --> 01:40:21.260]   which I actually find really interesting,
[01:40:21.260 --> 01:40:24.180]   variety brings this up.
[01:40:24.180 --> 01:40:26.220]   You could talk about how great your servers are,
[01:40:26.220 --> 01:40:28.340]   how you're going to have all sorts of horsepower.
[01:40:28.340 --> 01:40:30.580]   There was a lot of cool things like if you got in a very
[01:40:30.580 --> 01:40:34.740]   involved co-op game, each player could have their own hardware
[01:40:34.740 --> 01:40:37.860]   instance or even multiple hardware instances per player.
[01:40:37.860 --> 01:40:39.140]   All of that's great.
[01:40:39.140 --> 01:40:43.100]   But it's still got to come down this crappy frayed wire
[01:40:43.100 --> 01:40:46.860]   that's provided by Comcast or Verizon or AT&T or Cox
[01:40:46.860 --> 01:40:47.980]   or Frontier.
[01:40:47.980 --> 01:40:50.340]   And ultimately, as Variety points out,
[01:40:50.340 --> 01:40:53.220]   this is just ripe for exploitation.
[01:40:53.220 --> 01:40:56.820]   Without a net neutrality rule, it's just a matter of time
[01:40:56.820 --> 01:41:01.340]   before Comcast says, you know, if you'd like to play those games
[01:41:01.340 --> 01:41:04.020]   on Google, it'll cost you about 50 a month.
[01:41:04.020 --> 01:41:05.540]   Well, because they're latency dependent.
[01:41:05.540 --> 01:41:07.620]   And you can destroy a game experience
[01:41:07.620 --> 01:41:09.780]   by adding another 10 milliseconds of latency.
[01:41:09.780 --> 01:41:12.020]   We would like to give you the best possible gaming
[01:41:12.020 --> 01:41:13.140]   experience.
[01:41:13.140 --> 01:41:15.980]   And for that, that'll be $5 a month.
[01:41:15.980 --> 01:41:18.460]   And if you don't think that Comcast is capable of doing that,
[01:41:18.460 --> 01:41:21.540]   then just look at Comcast Flex.
[01:41:21.540 --> 01:41:26.540]   Xfinity Flex is the latest rent-taking scheme from Comcast
[01:41:26.540 --> 01:41:29.020]   for $5 a month.
[01:41:29.020 --> 01:41:33.180]   You can get an Netflix streaming box on your Comcast.
[01:41:33.180 --> 01:41:38.660]   But you have to have a high-end Comcast X1 system.
[01:41:38.660 --> 01:41:40.020]   Right.
[01:41:40.020 --> 01:41:41.460]   It's a really nice stream you got.
[01:41:41.460 --> 01:41:44.500]   So what do you shame if something would have happened to it?
[01:41:44.500 --> 01:41:47.180]   But this is a good example, like what Ed was talking about,
[01:41:47.180 --> 01:41:50.140]   where you just go whatever, find another $5.
[01:41:50.140 --> 01:41:51.060]   OK, I'll take it.
[01:41:51.060 --> 01:41:53.500]   But you can buy a Roku for like $25?
[01:41:53.500 --> 01:41:54.060]   Yes.
[01:41:54.060 --> 01:41:54.540]   And own it.
[01:41:54.540 --> 01:41:55.500]   But here's the thing.
[01:41:55.500 --> 01:42:00.020]   If something goes wrong with your Roku, you call Comcast.
[01:42:00.020 --> 01:42:04.740]   And they say, sorry, that's a problem with your hardware.
[01:42:04.740 --> 01:42:06.220]   You call Roku.
[01:42:06.220 --> 01:42:09.220]   And they say, well, we think it might be a problem
[01:42:09.220 --> 01:42:10.140]   with your network.
[01:42:10.140 --> 01:42:14.020]   And you can't ever get those two people talking to another.
[01:42:14.020 --> 01:42:16.340]   Whereas if you buy it all from one place,
[01:42:16.340 --> 01:42:18.220]   you call one support line.
[01:42:18.220 --> 01:42:20.220]   And they're going to own the problem.
[01:42:20.220 --> 01:42:21.300]   Now, getting this--
[01:42:21.300 --> 01:42:23.820]   Wait, wait, wait, wait, because if you call Comcast,
[01:42:23.820 --> 01:42:25.420]   you say there's something wrong with the go,
[01:42:25.420 --> 01:42:26.900]   oh, we upgraded that router.
[01:42:26.900 --> 01:42:28.940]   You can buy the new one for $85.
[01:42:28.940 --> 01:42:30.860]   Or you can rent it for an additional $4 a month.
[01:42:30.860 --> 01:42:33.420]   Worst part of my to-do list, it ends up
[01:42:33.420 --> 01:42:35.380]   staying on that to do this for months.
[01:42:35.380 --> 01:42:37.780]   Call Comcast about.
[01:42:37.780 --> 01:42:40.980]   It's the thing, isn't it, that you put off the longest?
[01:42:40.980 --> 01:42:41.940]   The last thing.
[01:42:41.940 --> 01:42:43.020]   I'd rather have a tooth pull.
[01:42:43.020 --> 01:42:44.140]   They are responsible for it.
[01:42:44.140 --> 01:42:44.660]   Yes.
[01:42:44.660 --> 01:42:45.940]   At least there's something.
[01:42:45.940 --> 01:42:49.460]   And it's the same reason why when
[01:42:49.460 --> 01:42:52.340]   you were saying earlier, Larry, that why would someone
[01:42:52.340 --> 01:42:55.980]   buy this Apple product when the Roku one is superior?
[01:42:55.980 --> 01:42:57.260]   Well, guess what?
[01:42:57.260 --> 01:43:03.380]   If I'm a loyal Apple user, I'm not super price conscious.
[01:43:03.380 --> 01:43:05.620]   And I know that I can get it all from one place.
[01:43:05.620 --> 01:43:08.580]   And if something goes wrong, I either call Apple support
[01:43:08.580 --> 01:43:11.620]   or I take it into the genius bar.
[01:43:11.620 --> 01:43:13.060]   That's true.
[01:43:13.060 --> 01:43:19.180]   And that's why bundling has been a successful business
[01:43:19.180 --> 01:43:23.020]   model for years because as soon as you start--
[01:43:23.020 --> 01:43:25.660]   A key benefit of our platform.
[01:43:25.660 --> 01:43:27.100]   I'm sorry.
[01:43:27.100 --> 01:43:31.060]   Well, I just call Ed Vod if I have a technical problem.
[01:43:31.060 --> 01:43:33.460]   Zach has edited together--
[01:43:33.460 --> 01:43:35.340]   Zach is Carson's son.
[01:43:35.340 --> 01:43:35.940]   How old is he?
[01:43:35.940 --> 01:43:37.420]   14?
[01:43:37.420 --> 01:43:38.380]   He is 14, yes.
[01:43:38.380 --> 01:43:40.260]   He's made a video, YouTube video.
[01:43:40.260 --> 01:43:44.540]   He's an up and coming YouTube star in which he cut together
[01:43:44.540 --> 01:43:48.020]   key announcements from the Stadia announcement.
[01:43:48.020 --> 01:43:51.620]   Are his reactions in here?
[01:43:51.620 --> 01:43:53.020]   He doesn't do reaction videos.
[01:43:53.020 --> 01:43:55.100]   He just makes memes.
[01:43:55.100 --> 01:43:56.380]   This is a meme?
[01:43:56.380 --> 01:43:57.060]   A quick little meme.
[01:43:57.060 --> 01:44:00.620]   A key benefit of our platform is that a single creative
[01:44:00.620 --> 01:44:05.020]   vision and a single code base can now be enjoyed instantly
[01:44:05.020 --> 01:44:07.020]   across any screen.
[01:44:07.020 --> 01:44:10.500]   At the port being able to play game to cost.
[01:44:10.500 --> 01:44:10.980]   OK.
[01:44:10.980 --> 01:44:12.020]   He's not doing this.
[01:44:12.020 --> 01:44:15.020]   I want to point out that everybody who watched this video
[01:44:15.020 --> 01:44:18.220]   about Google's amazing new streaming gaming service
[01:44:18.220 --> 01:44:19.620]   saw two things.
[01:44:19.620 --> 01:44:22.900]   First, the camera guys butt-inching into the screen.
[01:44:22.900 --> 01:44:26.500]   Second, the stream broke up.
[01:44:26.500 --> 01:44:28.260]   It broke up and it didn't do it just once.
[01:44:28.260 --> 01:44:30.900]   Several times, this is going to be a lot of fun
[01:44:30.900 --> 01:44:32.060]   playing this video game.
[01:44:32.060 --> 01:44:33.220]   Let me tell you, kids.
[01:44:33.220 --> 01:44:33.740]   Oh.
[01:44:33.740 --> 01:44:34.740]   Oh.
[01:44:34.740 --> 01:44:35.900]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:44:35.900 --> 01:44:37.420]   Nice job, Zach.
[01:44:37.420 --> 01:44:40.780]   And now we're playing Google's most popular video game,
[01:44:40.780 --> 01:44:44.740]   the dinosaur game that you get when their internet is dead.
[01:44:44.740 --> 01:44:45.740]   Yeah.
[01:44:45.740 --> 01:44:48.820]   It's funny, whenever I hear a guy with a British accent
[01:44:48.820 --> 01:44:51.020]   doing a tech announcement, I think of Johnny Ive.
[01:44:51.020 --> 01:44:52.380]   Yeah.
[01:44:52.380 --> 01:44:55.580]   This is the thinnest gaming service we've ever made.
[01:44:55.580 --> 01:44:57.380]   Exactly.
[01:44:57.380 --> 01:45:00.260]   Sir Johnny really should do more on the Apple thing.
[01:45:00.260 --> 01:45:02.940]   I think he's like-- he's unsebatical, or he's dead.
[01:45:02.940 --> 01:45:04.020]   He's just over it.
[01:45:04.020 --> 01:45:04.980]   He's just done.
[01:45:04.980 --> 01:45:05.540]   Yeah.
[01:45:05.540 --> 01:45:06.020]   Goodbye.
[01:45:06.020 --> 01:45:08.300]   But it is true that every iPhone announced is always
[01:45:08.300 --> 01:45:09.780]   the best iPhone they've ever announced.
[01:45:09.780 --> 01:45:10.140]   Yeah.
[01:45:10.140 --> 01:45:11.980]   Otherwise, why would you get out seeing it?
[01:45:11.980 --> 01:45:12.460]   Oh, no.
[01:45:12.460 --> 01:45:14.140]   This one's not as good as the last one.
[01:45:14.140 --> 01:45:15.140]   I don't know.
[01:45:15.140 --> 01:45:16.460]   My last year is better.
[01:45:16.460 --> 01:45:17.580]   This one's OK.
[01:45:17.580 --> 01:45:21.300]   We tried, but we just couldn't improve last year's.
[01:45:21.300 --> 01:45:23.340]   So will Johnny Ive be on stage tomorrow?
[01:45:23.340 --> 01:45:23.840]   No.
[01:45:23.840 --> 01:45:24.540]   No, not tomorrow.
[01:45:24.540 --> 01:45:26.700]   Will celebrities be on stage tomorrow?
[01:45:26.700 --> 01:45:27.580]   Yes.
[01:45:27.580 --> 01:45:29.060]   Probably a couple of influencers.
[01:45:29.060 --> 01:45:29.660]   Oprah?
[01:45:29.660 --> 01:45:30.980]   Influenced Oprah.
[01:45:30.980 --> 01:45:31.340]   They've got it.
[01:45:31.340 --> 01:45:32.740]   Oprah's got a deal with Apple?
[01:45:32.740 --> 01:45:33.700]   Will I be there tomorrow?
[01:45:33.700 --> 01:45:34.300]   No.
[01:45:34.300 --> 01:45:35.700]   You're not invited or not going?
[01:45:35.700 --> 01:45:36.740]   No, I don't.
[01:45:36.740 --> 01:45:37.980]   Invited but not going?
[01:45:37.980 --> 01:45:38.820]   Yeah.
[01:45:38.820 --> 01:45:39.740]   I'll take your invitation.
[01:45:39.740 --> 01:45:41.620]   I'll take your invitation.
[01:45:41.620 --> 01:45:42.460]   Geez.
[01:45:42.460 --> 01:45:43.900]   If you give your invitation to Leo,
[01:45:43.900 --> 01:45:45.460]   he'll hold up an iPad.
[01:45:45.460 --> 01:45:46.340]   You're going to be--
[01:45:46.340 --> 01:45:46.840]   Shut up.
[01:45:46.840 --> 01:45:48.100]   No, I'm trying to throw up.
[01:45:48.100 --> 01:45:49.780]   Well, you know, I was on Apple's--
[01:45:49.780 --> 01:45:51.460]   I was like banned from Apple for years,
[01:45:51.460 --> 01:45:53.820]   but some reason I'm back in their good grace
[01:45:53.820 --> 01:45:54.740]   is I have no idea why.
[01:45:54.740 --> 01:45:58.420]   His motto was banned because they bought a stolen iPhone
[01:45:58.420 --> 01:46:00.620]   and took it apart and the police had to be called.
[01:46:00.620 --> 01:46:01.900]   They're even back.
[01:46:01.900 --> 01:46:02.380]   They're back.
[01:46:02.380 --> 01:46:02.820]   Me?
[01:46:02.820 --> 01:46:05.900]   One, you do one stream of Steve Jobs
[01:46:05.900 --> 01:46:08.660]   introducing the iPad, and that's it forever.
[01:46:08.660 --> 01:46:11.660]   I think you're in the grandfather part of the ban list.
[01:46:11.660 --> 01:46:12.860]   Oh, I don't really care.
[01:46:12.860 --> 01:46:17.100]   Honestly, we'll be here tomorrow morning watching Apple's
[01:46:17.100 --> 01:46:19.580]   stream talking about it, commentating on about it.
[01:46:19.580 --> 01:46:21.860]   It's me, Megan Moroni, anybody else joining us?
[01:46:21.860 --> 01:46:23.580]   Carson, just the two of us.
[01:46:23.580 --> 01:46:24.100]   OK.
[01:46:24.100 --> 01:46:25.100]   It'll watch you.
[01:46:25.100 --> 01:46:26.420]   It'll be a lot of fun.
[01:46:26.420 --> 01:46:28.780]   Well, the last time we did this-- part of the fun.
[01:46:28.780 --> 01:46:30.620]   The last time we did this, Apple issued a takedown
[01:46:30.620 --> 01:46:33.100]   and took our YouTube live channel off for two weeks.
[01:46:33.100 --> 01:46:34.300]   So that'll be part of the fun.
[01:46:34.300 --> 01:46:35.340]   I like this, that.
[01:46:35.340 --> 01:46:36.380]   Wait, what?
[01:46:36.380 --> 01:46:37.780]   Yeah.
[01:46:37.780 --> 01:46:38.740]   Yeah, I think they ban--
[01:46:38.740 --> 01:46:41.140]   you're not allowed to broadcast any portion of their--
[01:46:41.140 --> 01:46:42.220]   I'm sorry, but I am.
[01:46:42.220 --> 01:46:46.940]   It's called Fair Use of Commentary of a news event.
[01:46:46.940 --> 01:46:48.780]   Do we broadcast press conferences?
[01:46:48.780 --> 01:46:49.940]   It's a press conference.
[01:46:49.940 --> 01:46:51.020]   Excuse me.
[01:46:51.020 --> 01:46:53.380]   And did they add any value to the broadcast?
[01:46:53.380 --> 01:46:54.180]   Yes, they did.
[01:46:54.180 --> 01:46:54.820]   It was commentary.
[01:46:54.820 --> 01:46:56.060]   They weren't charging for it.
[01:46:56.060 --> 01:46:57.340]   They do have more press conferences
[01:46:57.340 --> 01:46:58.900]   than the Trump administration does.
[01:46:58.900 --> 01:46:59.420]   They do.
[01:46:59.420 --> 01:47:00.020]   Far more.
[01:47:00.020 --> 01:47:00.780]   Far more.
[01:47:00.780 --> 01:47:04.620]   Now, we'll be streaming it, and we'll be inviting takedowns.
[01:47:04.620 --> 01:47:08.180]   And I'll give you my address, and you can write to me.
[01:47:08.180 --> 01:47:10.260]   I'll show you today, bro.
[01:47:10.260 --> 01:47:12.020]   Before we do the ad, let's--
[01:47:12.020 --> 01:47:14.380]   do we have a best of video for--
[01:47:14.380 --> 01:47:15.020]   For sure do.
[01:47:15.020 --> 01:47:17.940]   Because sometimes I know that you get busy.
[01:47:17.940 --> 01:47:18.860]   You have a busy life.
[01:47:18.860 --> 01:47:21.180]   You don't get to watch all the Twitch shows.
[01:47:21.180 --> 01:47:23.100]   You'd really like to watch.
[01:47:23.100 --> 01:47:25.980]   So what we do is we take some of the best moments from this week,
[01:47:25.980 --> 01:47:30.380]   and we put them together so you can see what you missed this week on Twitch.
[01:47:30.380 --> 01:47:32.340]   Previously on Twitch.
[01:47:32.340 --> 01:47:36.460]   Meditation is all about spending time with yourself.
[01:47:36.460 --> 01:47:39.460]   One can very easily drop down onto the floor or into a chair,
[01:47:39.460 --> 01:47:45.660]   close their eyes, drift off into bliss, or they could pitch in on Eric Antenow's Kickstarter
[01:47:45.660 --> 01:47:48.740]   project called Silent Meditation on Vinyl.
[01:47:48.740 --> 01:47:53.660]   For $20, you two could have received your very own 12-inch copy
[01:47:53.660 --> 01:47:55.660]   of Silent Meditation.
[01:47:55.660 --> 01:47:58.460]   20 minutes per silent record silence.
[01:47:58.460 --> 01:48:00.380]   For eating Twitch live specials.
[01:48:00.380 --> 01:48:01.620]   Our vision is so easy.
[01:48:01.620 --> 01:48:02.780]   It was to be heard by it.
[01:48:02.780 --> 01:48:05.140]   One place for all the way to be played.
[01:48:05.140 --> 01:48:06.500]   It was literally for any game.
[01:48:06.500 --> 01:48:07.260]   What do you choose?
[01:48:07.260 --> 01:48:08.260]   There's nothing to discover.
[01:48:08.260 --> 01:48:11.060]   The latest Assassin's Creed on the challenge to Twitch.
[01:48:11.060 --> 01:48:14.460]   On Ubisoft's official channel on YouTube.
[01:48:14.460 --> 01:48:17.260]   You will notice the play now button.
[01:48:17.260 --> 01:48:18.260]   Right there in YouTube.
[01:48:18.260 --> 01:48:19.260]   Oh, we'll live in the play.
[01:48:19.260 --> 01:48:20.260]   In YouTube.
[01:48:20.260 --> 01:48:21.260]   Wow.
[01:48:21.260 --> 01:48:22.260]   Five seconds.
[01:48:22.260 --> 01:48:23.260]   Five second launch.
[01:48:23.260 --> 01:48:24.260]   That's so cool.
[01:48:24.260 --> 01:48:25.260]   That's a pretty compelling thing.
[01:48:25.260 --> 01:48:26.260]   See how excited I was?
[01:48:26.260 --> 01:48:27.260]   LIES!
[01:48:27.260 --> 01:48:28.260]   That's about Android.
[01:48:28.260 --> 01:48:33.060]   Friends at 9 to 5 Google, they've got some deets on the Pixel 3A.
[01:48:33.060 --> 01:48:37.060]   From now on, I'm calling the 3A XL, the Pixel 3 XL.
[01:48:37.060 --> 01:48:40.460]   And every time it rings, the ringtone is November Rain.
[01:48:40.460 --> 01:48:49.060]   It's just, it's just Axel Rose going, "Just stop out of the head of the box to the cold
[01:48:49.060 --> 01:48:51.060]   November Rain."
[01:48:51.060 --> 01:48:53.060]   I want my TwiTv.
[01:48:53.060 --> 01:48:56.060]   Oh my God, Jim Cutler.
[01:48:56.060 --> 01:49:00.380]   Wait, you have to explain this record to me.
[01:49:00.380 --> 01:49:02.060]   It is actual silence on a record.
[01:49:02.060 --> 01:49:03.700]   Isn't there a side B?
[01:49:03.700 --> 01:49:05.820]   I think there's a second side, which is also silent.
[01:49:05.820 --> 01:49:07.340]   And what somebody wants?
[01:49:07.340 --> 01:49:08.340]   From meditating?
[01:49:08.340 --> 01:49:09.340]   What?
[01:49:09.340 --> 01:49:10.340]   What?
[01:49:10.340 --> 01:49:11.820]   Is it believe it or not?
[01:49:11.820 --> 01:49:14.540]   It was Andy Inako's pick of the week on Macbreak Weekly.
[01:49:14.540 --> 01:49:16.060]   So it's like white noise or?
[01:49:16.060 --> 01:49:17.060]   No, no, no.
[01:49:17.060 --> 01:49:18.060]   No.
[01:49:18.060 --> 01:49:23.060]   Maybe there's a clicks of pops if you don't take good care of your vinyl.
[01:49:23.060 --> 01:49:24.860]   It's on Kickstarter.
[01:49:24.860 --> 01:49:26.500]   It's, let's see, what is it?
[01:49:26.500 --> 01:49:29.380]   So it simulates having tonight as a YouTube update.
[01:49:29.380 --> 01:49:33.100]   But what's great is they've raised of the $600 goal.
[01:49:33.100 --> 01:49:34.780]   This guy was really not very confident.
[01:49:34.780 --> 01:49:35.780]   They've raised $5,900.
[01:49:35.780 --> 01:49:36.780]   I know he has $4.
[01:49:36.780 --> 01:49:37.780]   I know he has $4.
[01:49:37.780 --> 01:49:38.780]   I don't get it.
[01:49:38.780 --> 01:49:39.780]   I don't get it.
[01:49:39.780 --> 01:49:40.780]   I don't get it.
[01:49:40.780 --> 01:49:42.780]   I mean, I understand white noise.
[01:49:42.780 --> 01:49:45.780]   But I mean, I'm in the meditation business.
[01:49:45.780 --> 01:49:46.780]   Right.
[01:49:46.780 --> 01:49:55.540]   This record has not one but two silent meditations, each side 20 minutes of utter silence.
[01:49:55.540 --> 01:49:57.900]   No narration, no sound.
[01:49:57.900 --> 01:50:01.140]   Will there be a CD version so I can have the silence in more clarity?
[01:50:01.140 --> 01:50:03.500]   Better yet, it's on a 140 gram vinyl.
[01:50:03.500 --> 01:50:05.580]   He sent me $10.
[01:50:05.580 --> 01:50:07.540]   I will instruct you how to go into a room.
[01:50:07.540 --> 01:50:08.540]   Close the door.
[01:50:08.540 --> 01:50:09.540]   Close the door.
[01:50:09.540 --> 01:50:11.540]   Turn off your devices.
[01:50:11.540 --> 01:50:12.540]   All right.
[01:50:12.540 --> 01:50:13.540]   All right.
[01:50:13.540 --> 01:50:17.460]   That's definitely a first world.
[01:50:17.460 --> 01:50:19.540]   It's Kickstarter is what it is.
[01:50:19.540 --> 01:50:20.540]   It's just unbelievable.
[01:50:20.540 --> 01:50:22.820]   And it's still probably not be delivered.
[01:50:22.820 --> 01:50:24.540]   Yeah, right.
[01:50:24.540 --> 01:50:25.540]   We were having some trouble with this.
[01:50:25.540 --> 01:50:27.100]   You had a horrible record, right?
[01:50:27.100 --> 01:50:28.100]   Oh, man.
[01:50:28.100 --> 01:50:29.100]   I just stopped.
[01:50:29.100 --> 01:50:31.060]   I had to stop buying stuff on Kickstarter.
[01:50:31.060 --> 01:50:36.300]   I think the final thing was the floating bonsai tree, which really, I mean, honestly looked
[01:50:36.300 --> 01:50:37.300]   really cool.
[01:50:37.300 --> 01:50:40.060]   So it had a big base with like a heavy magnet.
[01:50:40.060 --> 01:50:44.540]   And then there was this pumice rock with the metal plate in it and it would hover.
[01:50:44.540 --> 01:50:47.020]   And then there was a cute little bonsai tree growing out of it.
[01:50:47.020 --> 01:50:52.620]   So it was like a was really cool, except when I got it, bonsai not included.
[01:50:52.620 --> 01:50:55.220]   And when you put the, if you bought a bonsai tree, put it in there, then you would have
[01:50:55.220 --> 01:50:57.140]   to shave the rock so it would be balanced.
[01:50:57.140 --> 01:50:58.620]   Otherwise it would just go up.
[01:50:58.620 --> 01:51:00.980]   So it was just too much work.
[01:51:00.980 --> 01:51:05.540]   This is like the modern version of those late night television commercials on really crappy
[01:51:05.540 --> 01:51:06.540]   cable channels.
[01:51:06.540 --> 01:51:08.420]   But at least that stuff came.
[01:51:08.420 --> 01:51:10.580]   I mean, I bought a lot of stuff that never even came.
[01:51:10.580 --> 01:51:12.540]   Is that freedom rock?
[01:51:12.540 --> 01:51:16.820]   Do you want fine, fresh, fierce, interactive LED lashes?
[01:51:16.820 --> 01:51:17.820]   I have a pair of them.
[01:51:17.820 --> 01:51:19.780]   I spent 40 bucks on the other day.
[01:51:19.780 --> 01:51:22.300]   Of course, you could put down $2,500 in a model Y.
[01:51:22.300 --> 01:51:25.580]   The sad thing about this one, yeah, I could.
[01:51:25.580 --> 01:51:26.580]   It probably will.
[01:51:26.580 --> 01:51:32.180]   The sad thing about this one is I put my money down on this.
[01:51:32.180 --> 01:51:35.980]   And within a day of this going up on Kickstarter, there were Chinese knockoffs being sold for
[01:51:35.980 --> 01:51:36.980]   half the price.
[01:51:36.980 --> 01:51:37.980]   Of course.
[01:51:37.980 --> 01:51:40.460]   Well, where were they going to have the manufactured in the first place?
[01:51:40.460 --> 01:51:41.700]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:51:41.700 --> 01:51:43.700]   What else?
[01:51:43.700 --> 01:51:46.940]   I'm just looking because you're right at, you reminded me.
[01:51:46.940 --> 01:51:47.940]   Oh, yeah.
[01:51:47.940 --> 01:51:48.940]   Yeah.
[01:51:48.940 --> 01:51:51.460]   This is all depressing.
[01:51:51.460 --> 01:51:52.460]   This is this came.
[01:51:52.460 --> 01:51:55.140]   I ordered this luggage in...
[01:51:55.140 --> 01:51:56.140]   Aluminum.
[01:51:56.140 --> 01:51:57.140]   In 2017.
[01:51:57.140 --> 01:51:58.140]   So what made it start?
[01:51:58.140 --> 01:51:59.140]   It just came.
[01:51:59.140 --> 01:52:00.940]   Well, it turns out it wasn't so smart.
[01:52:00.940 --> 01:52:04.700]   It has a battery built in, but I can't check this luggage because it has a battery built
[01:52:04.700 --> 01:52:05.700]   in.
[01:52:05.700 --> 01:52:06.700]   All right.
[01:52:06.700 --> 01:52:07.700]   Right.
[01:52:07.700 --> 01:52:12.780]   The regulations changed between the time they offered it and the time I bought it.
[01:52:12.780 --> 01:52:15.820]   We'll be back with more in just a bit, but first a word from...
[01:52:15.820 --> 01:52:17.180]   I love this.
[01:52:17.180 --> 01:52:18.180]   Digital Ocean.
[01:52:18.180 --> 01:52:19.820]   I know, Father Robert, you're a digital ocean fan too.
[01:52:19.820 --> 01:52:26.620]   You use it as I do because we're amateurs for prototyping web apps, websites, but it's
[01:52:26.620 --> 01:52:30.300]   also used by startups of all sizes for a minimum viable product.
[01:52:30.300 --> 01:52:33.660]   I see people running production servers on it all the time.
[01:52:33.660 --> 01:52:41.180]   Digital Ocean is the simplest, easiest to use cloud platform for developers, for teams.
[01:52:41.180 --> 01:52:47.820]   You can deploy, manage and scale cloud applications faster and more efficiently with Digital Ocean.
[01:52:47.820 --> 01:52:48.980]   And I'm going to show you.
[01:52:48.980 --> 01:52:54.380]   I have to think back in time, let me log in here, to when I was first starting out in
[01:52:54.380 --> 01:52:58.140]   this business and I wanted to create a Twit website.
[01:52:58.140 --> 01:53:02.420]   First I had to find a web host, went down to South...
[01:53:02.420 --> 01:53:04.420]   Softlayer in Texas.
[01:53:04.420 --> 01:53:05.780]   They're now IBM.
[01:53:05.780 --> 01:53:07.460]   And then you say, "Well, I'd like a server.
[01:53:07.460 --> 01:53:08.460]   Yes, sir.
[01:53:08.460 --> 01:53:09.460]   What kind of server would you like?"
[01:53:09.460 --> 01:53:10.460]   And you have to specify it.
[01:53:10.460 --> 01:53:11.980]   And then they say, "Okay.
[01:53:11.980 --> 01:53:13.380]   We're going to provision that server.
[01:53:13.380 --> 01:53:17.220]   We'll get back to you in a week or two."
[01:53:17.220 --> 01:53:19.820]   And by the way, at this time, this was pretty cool.
[01:53:19.820 --> 01:53:20.820]   Oh, cool.
[01:53:20.820 --> 01:53:21.820]   All right.
[01:53:21.820 --> 01:53:24.620]   A week or two later, then you have to install all the software that you're going to use
[01:53:24.620 --> 01:53:26.380]   on that server.
[01:53:26.380 --> 01:53:30.220]   Maybe if there's a problem, another week passes, you finally get it up and running.
[01:53:30.220 --> 01:53:32.940]   And now you've got your website going.
[01:53:32.940 --> 01:53:37.860]   Or you can do what I would do today and go to dio.co/twit.
[01:53:37.860 --> 01:53:38.860]   DigitalOcean.
[01:53:38.860 --> 01:53:39.860]   Let me just show you.
[01:53:39.860 --> 01:53:41.860]   I'm going to log into my DigitalOcean account.
[01:53:41.860 --> 01:53:44.820]   They call them droplets because get it, it's a drop in the ocean.
[01:53:44.820 --> 01:53:48.180]   And I'm going to show you how fast it is to set up and provision a server.
[01:53:48.180 --> 01:53:49.660]   I'm going to create a new droplet.
[01:53:49.660 --> 01:53:50.660]   By the way, I'm not going to use.
[01:53:50.660 --> 01:53:51.660]   There's so many cool features.
[01:53:51.660 --> 01:53:53.260]   They've got Kubernetes.
[01:53:53.260 --> 01:53:54.740]   They've got additional volumes.
[01:53:54.740 --> 01:53:56.380]   You can have databases.
[01:53:56.380 --> 01:53:57.540]   They have custom DNS.
[01:53:57.540 --> 01:53:58.540]   We'll start here.
[01:53:58.540 --> 01:54:03.540]   You could choose an image, which distribution you want Ubuntu, free BSD, Fedora, Debian,
[01:54:03.540 --> 01:54:04.540]   CentOS.
[01:54:04.540 --> 01:54:06.220]   You could choose a container distribution.
[01:54:06.220 --> 01:54:08.700]   They support Docker and Kubernetes.
[01:54:08.700 --> 01:54:11.700]   Or I like the one button installs.
[01:54:11.700 --> 01:54:14.340]   This is, they call it now, the marketplace.
[01:54:14.340 --> 01:54:21.420]   Coming from WordPress to Django, Docker, Ghost, that's a blogging platform.
[01:54:21.420 --> 01:54:25.100]   Let's just set up, I don't know, what should we set up today, Father Rower?
[01:54:25.100 --> 01:54:27.980]   You want to set up just a plain old LAMP stack?
[01:54:27.980 --> 01:54:28.980]   You know what I like to do?
[01:54:28.980 --> 01:54:32.420]   Because I like to have node.js installed as well.
[01:54:32.420 --> 01:54:38.940]   So it'll be a LAMP stack, but it'll have node pre-installed on Ubuntu 18.04.
[01:54:38.940 --> 01:54:41.300]   So I'm ready to run my node application.
[01:54:41.300 --> 01:54:45.900]   I can have a standard starter or general purpose or CPU optimized.
[01:54:45.900 --> 01:54:46.900]   But let me watch this.
[01:54:46.900 --> 01:54:50.540]   I like to turn down the price all the way to $5 a month.
[01:54:50.540 --> 01:54:57.300]   That's a gigabyte, a CPU, 25 gigs of storage, gigabyte of RAM, 25 gigs of storage, a terabyte
[01:54:57.300 --> 01:54:59.460]   of transfer this per month.
[01:54:59.460 --> 01:55:03.820]   I do like to spend an extra buck to have backups enabled in case I screw anything up.
[01:55:03.820 --> 01:55:07.580]   If you want to add block storage, you can choose your data center, New York San Francisco,
[01:55:07.580 --> 01:55:10.740]   and Singapore, London, Frankfurt, Toronto, Bangalore.
[01:55:10.740 --> 01:55:12.620]   I always choose San Francisco.
[01:55:12.620 --> 01:55:16.660]   I also, as you know, Robert, this very handy to have SSH turned on so that you can have
[01:55:16.660 --> 01:55:18.900]   secure SSH login.
[01:55:18.900 --> 01:55:19.900]   There you go.
[01:55:19.900 --> 01:55:26.380]   Let's just call this Leo's, I will call it, we'll call it Padres node.
[01:55:26.380 --> 01:55:27.540]   Oh, I got my own.
[01:55:27.540 --> 01:55:28.540]   This one's for you.
[01:55:28.540 --> 01:55:31.860]   And I'm going to now watch less than a minute.
[01:55:31.860 --> 01:55:36.620]   I'm going to set up and provision a server with a public IP address that I'll have a console
[01:55:36.620 --> 01:55:38.300]   to I can log into.
[01:55:38.300 --> 01:55:39.500]   It's running a lamp stack.
[01:55:39.500 --> 01:55:41.500]   It's running node.js.
[01:55:41.500 --> 01:55:43.220]   It's already for my application.
[01:55:43.220 --> 01:55:45.260]   I can start uploading it, could start working.
[01:55:45.260 --> 01:55:47.420]   I can serve it publicly.
[01:55:47.420 --> 01:55:51.860]   They have many more features, including custom DNS load balancers.
[01:55:51.860 --> 01:55:56.100]   They have secure droplets, droplet metrics.
[01:55:56.100 --> 01:55:58.380]   This is, I've never seen anything so easy.
[01:55:58.380 --> 01:56:05.700]   This is transforming the, the, the economics of, of web apps, of web startup.
[01:56:05.700 --> 01:56:06.700]   It's incredible.
[01:56:06.700 --> 01:56:09.140]   My SQL Ruby on rails.
[01:56:09.140 --> 01:56:11.460]   They just introduced managed databases for Postgres.
[01:56:11.460 --> 01:56:13.940]   So you can launch your database with the push of a button.
[01:56:13.940 --> 01:56:16.340]   Oh, by the way, Padres node is up and ready.
[01:56:16.340 --> 01:56:18.820]   Should we, uh, that fast?
[01:56:18.820 --> 01:56:19.820]   Should we just log in?
[01:56:19.820 --> 01:56:22.060]   We'll just, we'll just log into your node.
[01:56:22.060 --> 01:56:23.540]   I get root access.
[01:56:23.540 --> 01:56:25.700]   It's got a public IP address.
[01:56:25.700 --> 01:56:26.700]   There it is.
[01:56:26.700 --> 01:56:30.380]   It's booting up system D. There it is.
[01:56:30.380 --> 01:56:31.380]   We're logged in.
[01:56:31.380 --> 01:56:34.860]   Well, actually we're not, because I'm not going to show you Padres secret password.
[01:56:34.860 --> 01:56:35.860]   It's amazing.
[01:56:35.860 --> 01:56:37.180]   Nine, nine, nine, nine, up time.
[01:56:37.180 --> 01:56:42.180]   You get an SLA, cloud firewalls full DNS management, free daily backups with point in
[01:56:42.180 --> 01:56:46.820]   time recovery, stand by nodes with automatic failover, end to end security.
[01:56:46.820 --> 01:56:51.180]   So if you've got a Raspberry Pi and you need a web based backend service for it, this is
[01:56:51.180 --> 01:56:52.700]   the place to do it.
[01:56:52.700 --> 01:56:54.660]   It's so affordable, so easy.
[01:56:54.660 --> 01:56:58.900]   And we're going to give you a hundred dollar credit right now at do.co/twit.
[01:56:58.900 --> 01:57:01.740]   So it's going to be free for you for at least a little while.
[01:57:01.740 --> 01:57:05.420]   Go to do.co/twit.
[01:57:05.420 --> 01:57:07.860]   I love digital ocean.
[01:57:07.860 --> 01:57:09.700]   The sky's the limit.
[01:57:09.700 --> 01:57:11.660]   Anything you want to do.
[01:57:11.660 --> 01:57:13.620]   Padre, I'll just turn on.
[01:57:13.620 --> 01:57:15.900]   Oh, I should show you this part too.
[01:57:15.900 --> 01:57:20.020]   And when you're done, you destroy the droplet.
[01:57:20.020 --> 01:57:21.620]   I'm destroying your droplet.
[01:57:21.620 --> 01:57:22.620]   Just destroy it.
[01:57:22.620 --> 01:57:23.620]   It's all gone.
[01:57:23.620 --> 01:57:24.620]   Goodbye, droplet.
[01:57:24.620 --> 01:57:26.620]   Completely securely erased.
[01:57:26.620 --> 01:57:27.620]   I love it.
[01:57:27.620 --> 01:57:28.620]   There you go.
[01:57:28.620 --> 01:57:29.620]   Boom.
[01:57:29.620 --> 01:57:30.620]   Gone.
[01:57:30.620 --> 01:57:31.620]   I should destroy that other droplet.
[01:57:31.620 --> 01:57:33.100]   I don't know what that's just hanging around.
[01:57:33.100 --> 01:57:36.180]   By the way, you see my bill in the upper right hand corner?
[01:57:36.180 --> 01:57:39.820]   This month, $3.94.
[01:57:39.820 --> 01:57:41.860]   It's less than a latte, folks.
[01:57:41.860 --> 01:57:44.300]   Do.co/twit.
[01:57:44.300 --> 01:57:47.580]   When you apply that $100 credit, it's free.
[01:57:47.580 --> 01:57:49.620]   Thank you, digital ocean.
[01:57:49.620 --> 01:57:53.580]   Transforming technology, transforming the ecosystem.
[01:57:53.580 --> 01:57:56.620]   That's just marvelous.
[01:57:56.620 --> 01:58:00.380]   We mentioned that Aloe and Google+ are gone April 2.
[01:58:00.380 --> 01:58:03.820]   I didn't mention that the Google URL shortener, Google.gull.
[01:58:03.820 --> 01:58:05.380]   Is that going away?
[01:58:05.380 --> 01:58:06.780]   It's going away as well.
[01:58:06.780 --> 01:58:07.780]   Google.
[01:58:07.780 --> 01:58:09.500]   I worry about Google Voice.
[01:58:09.500 --> 01:58:10.500]   That's what I've got.
[01:58:10.500 --> 01:58:11.500]   Me too.
[01:58:11.500 --> 01:58:13.540]   I feel like it's hanging on by a thread.
[01:58:13.540 --> 01:58:16.180]   I will be unreachable if that goes away.
[01:58:16.180 --> 01:58:18.500]   My Google Voice number is the number on my business card.
[01:58:18.500 --> 01:58:19.500]   I have everywhere.
[01:58:19.500 --> 01:58:24.500]   I've had to start shifting off of some of my second factor that's using that just in
[01:58:24.500 --> 01:58:25.500]   case.
[01:58:25.500 --> 01:58:29.780]   Well, I'm sure if they kill it, they'll give you a warning and you could move it to Twilio
[01:58:29.780 --> 01:58:30.940]   or somewhere else.
[01:58:30.940 --> 01:58:33.500]   You can port it anywhere.
[01:58:33.500 --> 01:58:34.700]   Yeah, you could port it.
[01:58:34.700 --> 01:58:36.340]   So you could put it on a phone if you wanted.
[01:58:36.340 --> 01:58:38.260]   I have it ringing multiple phones.
[01:58:38.260 --> 01:58:41.180]   What I love about it when I review a phone, I get a new phone.
[01:58:41.180 --> 01:58:45.100]   I immediately make it my Google+ number and then I can go and use it.
[01:58:45.100 --> 01:58:46.900]   That's how I call from Italy.
[01:58:46.900 --> 01:58:47.900]   I use Hangouts.
[01:58:47.900 --> 01:58:48.900]   It's cheap.
[01:58:48.900 --> 01:58:49.900]   No, it doesn't cost anything.
[01:58:49.900 --> 01:58:50.900]   Free.
[01:58:50.900 --> 01:58:52.700]   They have to be Italian.
[01:58:52.700 --> 01:58:57.380]   I do wonder how long Hangouts has to live as well.
[01:58:57.380 --> 01:59:00.500]   Robert, what would you use as an alternative to Google Voice?
[01:59:00.500 --> 01:59:02.380]   I know there are a lot of companies that do this.
[01:59:02.380 --> 01:59:04.100]   None for free probably.
[01:59:04.100 --> 01:59:05.100]   Right.
[01:59:05.100 --> 01:59:10.500]   I mean, I think we can safely get away from the old idea of it has to be a phone number.
[01:59:10.500 --> 01:59:13.500]   But in a way, I like that.
[01:59:13.500 --> 01:59:17.580]   And actually, if you use Signal or WhatsApp, it's tied to your phone number.
[01:59:17.580 --> 01:59:18.780]   I've been getting into Discord.
[01:59:18.780 --> 01:59:20.260]   I know it's a gaming service.
[01:59:20.260 --> 01:59:21.260]   I actually love Discord.
[01:59:21.260 --> 01:59:25.500]   I've got a couple of Discord services that I run right now because I've got one for family
[01:59:25.500 --> 01:59:30.820]   and friends and I've got one that basically the old know-how Google+ group has come into
[01:59:30.820 --> 01:59:31.820]   my Discord.
[01:59:31.820 --> 01:59:32.820]   Nice.
[01:59:32.820 --> 01:59:33.820]   So we talk about make-up products.
[01:59:33.820 --> 01:59:34.820]   Is it like our chat room?
[01:59:34.820 --> 01:59:35.820]   Like an IRC room?
[01:59:35.820 --> 01:59:36.820]   Oh, yeah.
[01:59:36.820 --> 01:59:37.820]   Yeah.
[01:59:37.820 --> 01:59:38.820]   But you have different channels.
[01:59:38.820 --> 01:59:40.380]   Just like we've got different channels in our chat room.
[01:59:40.380 --> 01:59:43.860]   And so you choose the one that is speaking about the topic that you want.
[01:59:43.860 --> 01:59:44.860]   We go back and forth.
[01:59:44.860 --> 01:59:48.780]   And so that's my touchstone to the Twitter army.
[01:59:48.780 --> 01:59:49.780]   Do you run the server at home?
[01:59:49.780 --> 01:59:50.780]   Do you run an identity?
[01:59:50.780 --> 01:59:53.300]   I Discord runs it for me.
[01:59:53.300 --> 01:59:54.900]   Oh, you just hit let them run it.
[01:59:54.900 --> 01:59:55.900]   Yeah.
[01:59:55.900 --> 01:59:56.900]   Do you pay for that?
[01:59:56.900 --> 01:59:57.900]   Nope.
[01:59:57.900 --> 01:59:58.900]   What?
[01:59:58.900 --> 01:59:59.900]   Nope.
[01:59:59.900 --> 02:00:00.900]   Completely free.
[02:00:00.900 --> 02:00:01.900]   100%.
[02:00:01.900 --> 02:00:02.900]   It's not end-end encrypted, but who cares?
[02:00:02.900 --> 02:00:03.900]   It's Genby.
[02:00:03.900 --> 02:00:04.900]   You can turn that on.
[02:00:04.900 --> 02:00:05.900]   Yeah.
[02:00:05.900 --> 02:00:09.060]   So in the private chat rooms, because they allow you to make text rooms and then they
[02:00:09.060 --> 02:00:10.660]   also allow you to make voice rooms.
[02:00:10.660 --> 02:00:14.980]   And you can turn on an off-encryption depending on what kind of performance you need.
[02:00:14.980 --> 02:00:17.900]   And it's got apps for iOS, for Android, for Windows.
[02:00:17.900 --> 02:00:25.860]   I think in the modern world, there's a real call for some sort of centralized, maybe
[02:00:25.860 --> 02:00:30.940]   not centralized, decentralized to be better, but some sort of authentication service where
[02:00:30.940 --> 02:00:39.260]   this is my one, you know, whatever it is, atleo, loport or whatever, but this is my one
[02:00:39.260 --> 02:00:42.780]   single place where you can find everything.
[02:00:42.780 --> 02:00:47.860]   And this is me and it's authenticated to be me, maybe GPG signing.
[02:00:47.860 --> 02:00:49.860]   I do that blockchain.
[02:00:49.860 --> 02:00:50.860]   Blockchain.
[02:00:50.860 --> 02:00:53.140]   Well, actually, that's a good use for blockchain.
[02:00:53.140 --> 02:00:54.140]   That's a good use for blockchain.
[02:00:54.140 --> 02:00:56.780]   In whatever preferred mode you want to be reached.
[02:00:56.780 --> 02:00:57.780]   Well, and I use...
[02:00:57.780 --> 02:00:59.820]   Why do you mean you're impossible to reach?
[02:00:59.820 --> 02:01:02.620]   Leo.ist, which is...
[02:01:02.620 --> 02:01:04.620]   I don't.
[02:01:04.620 --> 02:01:11.460]   Leo is to pull up my key base public page, which has all my information, all my links,
[02:01:11.460 --> 02:01:16.300]   my phone numbers, how to reach me via signal, what my PGP key is.
[02:01:16.300 --> 02:01:20.340]   So that's one page that refers to everything.
[02:01:20.340 --> 02:01:24.100]   And it's through key base, which I think is a really great service, but not widely known.
[02:01:24.100 --> 02:01:27.300]   Ed, do you have a centralized thing you use?
[02:01:27.300 --> 02:01:28.300]   No.
[02:01:28.300 --> 02:01:29.300]   I don't.
[02:01:29.300 --> 02:01:31.380]   I feel like we need that.
[02:01:31.380 --> 02:01:33.300]   And Google Voice was for many of us.
[02:01:33.300 --> 02:01:34.300]   Yeah.
[02:01:34.300 --> 02:01:39.820]   But, you know, email is becoming unwieldy for many people because it's sheer quantity of
[02:01:39.820 --> 02:01:40.820]   it.
[02:01:40.820 --> 02:01:41.820]   Texting is annoying.
[02:01:41.820 --> 02:01:45.180]   I hate it when PR people text me in the middle of the night to tell me about their products
[02:01:45.180 --> 02:01:46.460]   and I'm getting more of that.
[02:01:46.460 --> 02:01:51.940]   But there needs to be a way in which the recipient can somehow control the flow of information
[02:01:51.940 --> 02:01:56.060]   to yourself that's still convenient for people.
[02:01:56.060 --> 02:01:57.700]   And that's why Google+ was so awesome.
[02:01:57.700 --> 02:02:01.060]   And then this plus-the-red messaging, you know, which messaging service are you using?
[02:02:01.060 --> 02:02:02.060]   Are you using...
[02:02:02.060 --> 02:02:05.300]   Do you think that's a killer app somebody will say, "Oh, I put it out and everybody will
[02:02:05.300 --> 02:02:07.500]   go, "Oh, so we need that along."
[02:02:07.500 --> 02:02:15.140]   Well, the problem with all of those things is that they require large companies that
[02:02:15.140 --> 02:02:22.820]   have entrenched business models to agree on a common standard that they don't control.
[02:02:22.820 --> 02:02:28.820]   And historically, every time we've tried to do something like that, someone sabotages
[02:02:28.820 --> 02:02:29.820]   it.
[02:02:29.820 --> 02:02:31.700]   Well, we did it with email and we did it with text messaging.
[02:02:31.700 --> 02:02:33.620]   Email is a single real success.
[02:02:33.620 --> 02:02:38.020]   Text messaging, I'm not sure I agree with you because it's got the right SMS, but it's
[02:02:38.020 --> 02:02:39.180]   gotten very fragmented.
[02:02:39.180 --> 02:02:45.020]   And now Google wants RCS to take over from SMS, but the carriers don't want to do RCS.
[02:02:45.020 --> 02:02:46.620]   So it's actually starting to fragment.
[02:02:46.620 --> 02:02:49.300]   Email is not even talk about iMessage.
[02:02:49.300 --> 02:02:51.380]   Yeah, Apple is a complete silo.
[02:02:51.380 --> 02:02:54.100]   Well, all the messaging services, right.
[02:02:54.100 --> 02:02:55.100]   Right.
[02:02:55.100 --> 02:03:08.300]   And even email, you know, it just happened to be around at the beginning of everything.
[02:03:08.300 --> 02:03:20.460]   But getting protocols to sync properly on different devices, Google Gmail, they dumb
[02:03:20.460 --> 02:03:29.060]   it down for use on other platforms so that they're using the bare bones internet standards.
[02:03:29.060 --> 02:03:37.020]   But in a rational, cooperative world, the email standards would have grown.
[02:03:37.020 --> 02:03:40.420]   The baseline would have been much more than pop and SMTP.
[02:03:40.420 --> 02:03:46.900]   But I'm showing my age, but I think that you and Leo will remember when if you were
[02:03:46.900 --> 02:03:50.020]   an AOL subscriber, you couldn't send a message to a copy.
[02:03:50.020 --> 02:03:51.020]   Yeah, right.
[02:03:51.020 --> 02:03:52.020]   MCI mail.
[02:03:52.020 --> 02:03:54.260]   Yeah, MCI with a 55 cents a message on MCI.
[02:03:54.260 --> 02:03:59.380]   But you could then with a big deal with MCI and CompuServe finally had interconnected.
[02:03:59.380 --> 02:04:00.380]   They're federated.
[02:04:00.380 --> 02:04:01.780]   And that was the.
[02:04:01.780 --> 02:04:03.500]   And there are, you know, there's Mastodon.
[02:04:03.500 --> 02:04:05.940]   There's good news social, which is what Mastodon is based on.
[02:04:05.940 --> 02:04:10.220]   There's PixelFed, which is a good news social based Instagram.
[02:04:10.220 --> 02:04:11.220]   But you're right.
[02:04:11.220 --> 02:04:14.780]   And without the big commercial entities supporting it, which they never will because they want
[02:04:14.780 --> 02:04:17.900]   to silo everything, it's going to be pretty hard.
[02:04:17.900 --> 02:04:22.900]   And consumers, this is why consumers buy the Comcast Flexbox or Apple services.
[02:04:22.900 --> 02:04:23.900]   They want to make it.
[02:04:23.900 --> 02:04:24.900]   Yeah.
[02:04:24.900 --> 02:04:27.380]   I stick with their instant messaging for all my communications.
[02:04:27.380 --> 02:04:32.220]   But think your pain is their business model.
[02:04:32.220 --> 02:04:33.220]   Yeah.
[02:04:33.220 --> 02:04:34.220]   Yeah.
[02:04:34.220 --> 02:04:35.220]   I like it.
[02:04:35.220 --> 02:04:37.220]   They finally killed a kill game, right?
[02:04:37.220 --> 02:04:38.860]   Yeah, you can't use it anymore.
[02:04:38.860 --> 02:04:40.380]   That's why you're not getting any messages.
[02:04:40.380 --> 02:04:41.380]   That's why nobody calls.
[02:04:41.380 --> 02:04:42.380]   Good, really quiet.
[02:04:42.380 --> 02:04:43.380]   I thought I was just unpopular.
[02:04:43.380 --> 02:04:44.380]   Yeah.
[02:04:44.380 --> 02:04:45.380]   Kill the game server.
[02:04:45.380 --> 02:04:46.380]   So then there's Facebook.
[02:04:46.380 --> 02:04:48.060]   Oh boy.
[02:04:48.060 --> 02:04:50.980]   We stored hundreds of millions of your passwords in plain text.
[02:04:50.980 --> 02:04:51.980]   Yeah.
[02:04:51.980 --> 02:04:52.980]   Oh, what could go wrong?
[02:04:52.980 --> 02:04:54.940]   Oh, we'll possibly go wrong.
[02:04:54.940 --> 02:05:03.340]   It turned out as part of a routine security review in January, we found some user passwords
[02:05:03.340 --> 02:05:06.860]   stored in a readable format within our internal data storage systems.
[02:05:06.860 --> 02:05:13.340]   This cut our attention because basically 20,000 Facebook employees would have access
[02:05:13.340 --> 02:05:16.060]   to your passwords.
[02:05:16.060 --> 02:05:19.140]   Facebook says they will notify you if your passwords are stored in that way.
[02:05:19.140 --> 02:05:24.220]   The number of people whose passwords are stored that way seems to be going up as always.
[02:05:24.220 --> 02:05:28.740]   Facebook says it's at least hundreds of millions of Facebook light users, tens of millions of
[02:05:28.740 --> 02:05:34.180]   other Facebook users, tens of thousands of Instagram users.
[02:05:34.180 --> 02:05:37.620]   I think this is all part of a brilliant strategy because they've done so much shady stuff
[02:05:37.620 --> 02:05:40.380]   over the last couple of years that this doesn't even tick the meter.
[02:05:40.380 --> 02:05:42.180]   This is just like, oh, okay.
[02:05:42.180 --> 02:05:43.780]   Yeah, big deal.
[02:05:43.780 --> 02:05:44.980]   What could possibly go wrong?
[02:05:44.980 --> 02:05:48.300]   At least it was, as far as we know, only available to Facebook employees.
[02:05:48.300 --> 02:05:50.420]   Yeah, but they have thousands of employees.
[02:05:50.420 --> 02:05:52.980]   And they have these things called email and USB drives.
[02:05:52.980 --> 02:05:53.980]   So yay.
[02:05:53.980 --> 02:05:54.980]   And hackable.
[02:05:54.980 --> 02:05:55.980]   Yes.
[02:05:55.980 --> 02:05:57.980]   Other than that, it was perfect.
[02:05:57.980 --> 02:06:02.580]   Normally says Facebook, we hash and salt the passwords.
[02:06:02.580 --> 02:06:03.580]   Normally.
[02:06:03.580 --> 02:06:06.180]   I pepper mine, actually.
[02:06:06.180 --> 02:06:10.100]   That text file did not like caches.
[02:06:10.100 --> 02:06:14.900]   If you had a parody account on Twitter that's making fun of you and embarrassing and humiliating
[02:06:14.900 --> 02:06:19.820]   you, what would be the best way to shut it down?
[02:06:19.820 --> 02:06:23.100]   I think you should file a lawsuit.
[02:06:23.100 --> 02:06:33.180]   So, at Devin Cow, which was Devin Nunes's former chairman of the House Security Committee
[02:06:33.180 --> 02:06:40.260]   and now ranking member, it only had 1,200 followers on Monday.
[02:06:40.260 --> 02:06:44.300]   He sued them and Twitter for $250 million.
[02:06:44.300 --> 02:06:49.540]   It now has more than half a million members surpassing Nunes's own account.
[02:06:49.540 --> 02:06:54.100]   It's 134,000.
[02:06:54.100 --> 02:06:57.820]   By the way, they've got the special counsel on their...
[02:06:57.820 --> 02:07:04.180]   We're going to rename the Streisand effect to the Nunes cow effect because that lawsuit
[02:07:04.180 --> 02:07:06.900]   had the exact opposite effect.
[02:07:06.900 --> 02:07:11.460]   He also sued a parody Twitter account, Devin's mom.
[02:07:11.460 --> 02:07:12.460]   Right.
[02:07:12.460 --> 02:07:17.420]   Which, by the way, I think it would be a House of Cardsian twist, if it turns out that's
[02:07:17.420 --> 02:07:19.420]   actually Devin's mom.
[02:07:19.420 --> 02:07:22.220]   That would be incredible.
[02:07:22.220 --> 02:07:29.820]   Devin's cow is hopping on the monetization bandwagon with T-shirts, conspiracy meeting
[02:07:29.820 --> 02:07:30.820]   tonight.
[02:07:30.820 --> 02:07:31.820]   Don't tell Devin.
[02:07:31.820 --> 02:07:32.820]   You're $19.95.
[02:07:32.820 --> 02:07:37.820]   Well, the crazy part of this is they pulled out...
[02:07:37.820 --> 02:07:40.940]   I mean, he doesn't understand how the internet keeps everything.
[02:07:40.940 --> 02:07:43.380]   So they found that video from 2010 where he...
[02:07:43.380 --> 02:07:46.980]   Literally, he quotes, "I think people have every right to say what they want to it.
[02:07:46.980 --> 02:07:47.980]   They want to smear someone.
[02:07:47.980 --> 02:07:48.980]   They can do it."
[02:07:48.980 --> 02:07:53.860]   So that was him in 2010 versus him now saying, "But being mean."
[02:07:53.860 --> 02:08:03.340]   Well, so it's easy for us to poke fun at Devin Nunes for doing something that was transparently
[02:08:03.340 --> 02:08:04.340]   stupid.
[02:08:04.340 --> 02:08:06.460]   But there is a dark side to this.
[02:08:06.460 --> 02:08:07.940]   Oh, yes.
[02:08:07.940 --> 02:08:11.980]   There's at least three people that are sued here.
[02:08:11.980 --> 02:08:18.220]   Liz Mayer is the named person in it, and then the other two people, whoever is running those
[02:08:18.220 --> 02:08:24.540]   accounts, those three people are going to have to pay for legal representation.
[02:08:24.540 --> 02:08:31.420]   They're going to have to spend a lot of time and a lot of money defending themselves here.
[02:08:31.420 --> 02:08:36.260]   He filed the suit weirdly in Virginia.
[02:08:36.260 --> 02:08:43.460]   And one reason for that is that Virginia has really terrible weak anti-slap laws.
[02:08:43.460 --> 02:08:46.260]   So you can't...
[02:08:46.260 --> 02:08:48.260]   You can't...
[02:08:48.260 --> 02:08:54.340]   Anti-slap laws punish people for bringing frivolous lawsuits.
[02:08:54.340 --> 02:08:55.340]   But there...
[02:08:55.340 --> 02:08:59.860]   And usually can wind up turning the table so that you get your legal expenses paid and
[02:08:59.860 --> 02:09:01.940]   you might even get a judgment out of it.
[02:09:01.940 --> 02:09:07.420]   But they found a jurisdiction to file it in where those laws are really weak.
[02:09:07.420 --> 02:09:13.500]   And it's part of a trend that's been going on from that side of the aisle.
[02:09:13.500 --> 02:09:20.300]   Weaken libel laws make it easier to harass people for exercising their free speech rights.
[02:09:20.300 --> 02:09:27.300]   And I think that's the real story here, is that a powerful member of Congress is taking
[02:09:27.300 --> 02:09:33.620]   advantage of the court system to harass at least one American citizen and probably three,
[02:09:33.620 --> 02:09:39.060]   although we don't know who the cow and the mom are at this point yet.
[02:09:39.060 --> 02:09:44.100]   Does Twitter have to reveal the identities of those account holders?
[02:09:44.100 --> 02:09:45.100]   And discover it.
[02:09:45.100 --> 02:09:48.220]   I've never been able to get that information out of Twitter.
[02:09:48.220 --> 02:09:49.220]   Ever.
[02:09:49.220 --> 02:09:50.460]   Maybe I need to sue.
[02:09:50.460 --> 02:09:59.860]   Well, if you file a lawsuit, then yes, you would subpoena the information from Twitter.
[02:09:59.860 --> 02:10:04.540]   And then Twitter would fight the subpoena and the judge would have to order.
[02:10:04.540 --> 02:10:08.820]   They would have to compel that response.
[02:10:08.820 --> 02:10:10.620]   But it's literally chilling.
[02:10:10.620 --> 02:10:19.500]   No, but it's also created a lot of great puns like, "Move on and don't utter a word."
[02:10:19.500 --> 02:10:24.180]   And the fact is that Nunes actually comes from there actually 200-- I looked it up by
[02:10:24.180 --> 02:10:26.660]   Mercury News column about this today.
[02:10:26.660 --> 02:10:29.500]   There are 200 dairy farms in Nunes' district.
[02:10:29.500 --> 02:10:33.820]   So my thinking is, why do they actually focus on real cows and help them?
[02:10:33.820 --> 02:10:35.380]   Gary farmers?
[02:10:35.380 --> 02:10:41.660]   He actually-- his family owns a dairy farm in the Midwest.
[02:10:41.660 --> 02:10:44.580]   And I think it's in Iowa.
[02:10:44.580 --> 02:10:48.740]   And they were raided by ICE last year.
[02:10:48.740 --> 02:10:51.860]   It was a very, very large.
[02:10:51.860 --> 02:10:58.780]   And nobody in the town would talk about the Nunes family at all because they were afraid.
[02:10:58.780 --> 02:11:02.500]   And I have to say, I'm somewhat sympathetic because Twitter is a great place.
[02:11:02.500 --> 02:11:04.940]   If you want to harass somebody, it's very toxic.
[02:11:04.940 --> 02:11:06.580]   Even if you play talk's been harassed.
[02:11:06.580 --> 02:11:07.820]   Who hasn't been harassed?
[02:11:07.820 --> 02:11:14.540]   I think of Robin Williams' daughter, who was after her father's death horrifically harassed
[02:11:14.540 --> 02:11:15.540]   and had to leave Twitter.
[02:11:15.540 --> 02:11:18.420]   She didn't sue, but honestly, Twitter is--
[02:11:18.420 --> 02:11:19.740]   Look at Cindy and Meghan McCain.
[02:11:19.740 --> 02:11:22.660]   You heard the story about Cindy McCain and Messenger, that message that she got this
[02:11:22.660 --> 02:11:23.660]   week?
[02:11:23.660 --> 02:11:24.660]   No, what happened?
[02:11:24.660 --> 02:11:27.980]   Oh, somebody sent her an absolutely disgusting message, which I wouldn't even repeat.
[02:11:27.980 --> 02:11:28.980]   On Twitter or--
[02:11:28.980 --> 02:11:29.980]   On actually Messenger.
[02:11:29.980 --> 02:11:30.980]   Facebook Messenger.
[02:11:30.980 --> 02:11:31.980]   Don't put it on the screen.
[02:11:31.980 --> 02:11:33.620]   No, you don't want to put it on the screen.
[02:11:33.620 --> 02:11:34.820]   It's disgusting.
[02:11:34.820 --> 02:11:39.140]   But among other things, it threatened her daughter, Meghan, made fun of her weight.
[02:11:39.140 --> 02:11:40.140]   And it was just--
[02:11:40.140 --> 02:11:41.860]   Oh, because she was defending her father.
[02:11:41.860 --> 02:11:42.860]   Defending her father.
[02:11:42.860 --> 02:11:44.860]   From another person on--
[02:11:44.860 --> 02:11:49.180]   Yeah, a guy named Donald Trump.
[02:11:49.180 --> 02:11:51.860]   I'm not a fan of Twitter, I have to say.
[02:11:51.860 --> 02:11:55.420]   And every time I say this, there's plenty of journalists who will stand up and say, "No,
[02:11:55.420 --> 02:11:57.620]   but it's a really great source."
[02:11:57.620 --> 02:12:03.220]   At the same time, I honestly think it's a bad source for our media, because a lot of
[02:12:03.220 --> 02:12:08.620]   Twitter outrage, again, gets amplified further by mainstream media, which says, "Oh, they're
[02:12:08.620 --> 02:12:10.060]   going crazy right now."
[02:12:10.060 --> 02:12:13.700]   And it's just Twitter outrage, which has no weight in my mind at all.
[02:12:13.700 --> 02:12:17.700]   My problem with Twitter is that even now that it's 280 characters, it's still not enough
[02:12:17.700 --> 02:12:20.300]   to make a nuanced statement about anything serious.
[02:12:20.300 --> 02:12:22.780]   The words "neuance" in Twitter seem an odd word.
[02:12:22.780 --> 02:12:25.740]   And I have actually gotten trouble trying to tweet things out that were complicated and
[02:12:25.740 --> 02:12:26.740]   people misunderstand.
[02:12:26.740 --> 02:12:27.740]   Just don't tweet.
[02:12:27.740 --> 02:12:28.740]   Elon, don't tweet.
[02:12:28.740 --> 02:12:33.100]   There's only one good way to use Twitter, and that is to put your statements out there
[02:12:33.100 --> 02:12:34.820]   and then ignore them.
[02:12:34.820 --> 02:12:36.380]   Don't get in a conversation.
[02:12:36.380 --> 02:12:37.380]   Don't get into it.
[02:12:37.380 --> 02:12:39.460]   Donald Trump Jr. just tweeted a minute ago.
[02:12:39.460 --> 02:12:40.460]   Oh, there you go.
[02:12:40.460 --> 02:12:41.460]   Let's be precise.
[02:12:41.460 --> 02:12:45.260]   19 Hillary supporting leftist lawyers, who's the dream it would be to take them down.
[02:12:45.260 --> 02:12:46.260]   What?
[02:12:46.260 --> 02:12:47.260]   Don't even know.
[02:12:47.260 --> 02:12:48.260]   I don't know.
[02:12:48.260 --> 02:12:49.260]   Even though it's not.
[02:12:49.260 --> 02:12:51.740]   The other way to survive Twitter is you be very literal with your muting.
[02:12:51.740 --> 02:12:54.500]   My block bot does all my blocking, but I will mute people.
[02:12:54.500 --> 02:12:56.620]   Why am I following Donald Trump?
[02:12:56.620 --> 02:12:58.420]   It seems like we do too much.
[02:12:58.420 --> 02:13:00.900]   Well, probably it's a retweet, and that's the other problem.
[02:13:00.900 --> 02:13:01.900]   I use TweetDeck.
[02:13:01.900 --> 02:13:03.300]   I see you're using TweetDeck.
[02:13:03.300 --> 02:13:07.580]   One of the real reasons I use TweetDeck, and I'm sure Jack will kill it any day now,
[02:13:07.580 --> 02:13:10.300]   is I can say in that column, no retweets.
[02:13:10.300 --> 02:13:14.900]   Retweets are the single worst pollutant in any Twitter stream, because the retweets
[02:13:14.900 --> 02:13:21.980]   are the Twitter outrage engine riffing up, and I just don't do retweets.
[02:13:21.980 --> 02:13:24.700]   Why are we even spending any energy on it?
[02:13:24.700 --> 02:13:27.740]   Good luck, Devin Cow.
[02:13:27.740 --> 02:13:29.300]   Yeah.
[02:13:29.300 --> 02:13:30.300]   What was it?
[02:13:30.300 --> 02:13:34.220]   Facebook is where you go to listen to things you don't care about from people who you do
[02:13:34.220 --> 02:13:38.100]   care about, Twitter is where you go to listen about things that you do care about from people
[02:13:38.100 --> 02:13:39.340]   you care nothing about.
[02:13:39.340 --> 02:13:40.620]   I think that's fair.
[02:13:40.620 --> 02:13:41.620]   That's about fair.
[02:13:41.620 --> 02:13:44.460]   Instagram is the new home for hate, the Atlantic says.
[02:13:44.460 --> 02:13:45.460]   Yay.
[02:13:45.460 --> 02:13:48.620]   We thought it was just pictures.
[02:13:48.620 --> 02:13:53.660]   Misinformation apparently is thriving on Instagram, and I don't know how this works,
[02:13:53.660 --> 02:13:56.740]   because at least with Instagram, there isn't retweeting.
[02:13:56.740 --> 02:14:03.220]   You have to follow people on Instagram, or you're not going to see this stuff, right?
[02:14:03.220 --> 02:14:07.260]   Or is that not the case?
[02:14:07.260 --> 02:14:13.420]   How would Instagram, my wife uses it, I stopped using it, so I'm not an expert.
[02:14:13.420 --> 02:14:17.780]   My wife uses it, but she makes it a private account, so only people who she knows can
[02:14:17.780 --> 02:14:20.220]   follow her pictures.
[02:14:20.220 --> 02:14:23.900]   She only follows other people she knows, and she likes it, and I don't blame her for liking
[02:14:23.900 --> 02:14:26.780]   it, because it's only stuff she lets in.
[02:14:26.780 --> 02:14:28.980]   I mean, by default, an Instagram account is public.
[02:14:28.980 --> 02:14:31.700]   You can make it private, which was smart for your wife to do that.
[02:14:31.700 --> 02:14:36.180]   We recommend it connect safely, we recommend the teens always have private accounts, unless
[02:14:36.180 --> 02:14:38.180]   they happen to be public figures like the daughter of us.
[02:14:38.180 --> 02:14:40.420]   One problem, though, is the same problem with YouTube.
[02:14:40.420 --> 02:14:42.740]   It's the recommendation engine.
[02:14:42.740 --> 02:14:45.660]   And here's a motherboard piece by Joseph Cox.
[02:14:45.660 --> 02:14:52.580]   It took 10 seconds for Instagram to push me into an anti-vax rabbit hole with their recommendation
[02:14:52.580 --> 02:14:54.860]   engine.
[02:14:54.860 --> 02:14:56.620]   So there's part of the problem.
[02:14:56.620 --> 02:15:00.620]   These recommendation engines are just notoriously horrific.
[02:15:00.620 --> 02:15:02.500]   They just don't work.
[02:15:02.500 --> 02:15:08.580]   They amplify the wrong things because they're designed to generate engagement.
[02:15:08.580 --> 02:15:13.660]   They're designed to do what's good for the company, but maybe not so good for your middle.
[02:15:13.660 --> 02:15:18.700]   It's one of my biggest concerns about online news, too, the fact that we are fed a diet
[02:15:18.700 --> 02:15:24.140]   of things that the source thinks that we want to consume as opposed to what actually is
[02:15:24.140 --> 02:15:25.140]   important.
[02:15:25.140 --> 02:15:26.140]   Yeah.
[02:15:26.140 --> 02:15:28.900]   24-hour news cycle has not been good for our polity.
[02:15:28.900 --> 02:15:29.900]   That's for sure.
[02:15:29.900 --> 02:15:30.900]   I had a turn.
[02:15:30.900 --> 02:15:35.260]   Funny, on the way over here, I was listening to MSNBC in my car on my car.
[02:15:35.260 --> 02:15:36.620]   I had to turn it off.
[02:15:36.620 --> 02:15:38.540]   It just, at certain points, it just gets infuriating.
[02:15:38.540 --> 02:15:39.540]   It's awkward to be in the house.
[02:15:39.540 --> 02:15:41.940]   Put on some music.
[02:15:41.940 --> 02:15:43.180]   On the other hand, you can go too far.
[02:15:43.180 --> 02:15:51.500]   In Australia, Telstra, the big Telco, blocked 4chan, 8chan, and vote, the blog ZeroHedge and
[02:15:51.500 --> 02:16:00.340]   the video hosting platform Live Leak because they were repeating the video of the Christ
[02:16:00.340 --> 02:16:06.020]   Church terrorist attack or rebroadcasting his manifesto or even just information.
[02:16:06.020 --> 02:16:09.660]   Telstra, which is an ISP, blocked it.
[02:16:09.660 --> 02:16:12.420]   That strikes me as the entire service, the entire service.
[02:16:12.420 --> 02:16:13.420]   The entire service.
[02:16:13.420 --> 02:16:14.420]   Now, I...
[02:16:14.420 --> 02:16:18.420]   That's the way New Zealand law works.
[02:16:18.420 --> 02:16:20.700]   This is Australia, but is that how Australia law works?
[02:16:20.700 --> 02:16:21.700]   Australia has tried a lot of it.
[02:16:21.700 --> 02:16:22.940]   I think Australia does too, right?
[02:16:22.940 --> 02:16:23.940]   Yeah.
[02:16:23.940 --> 02:16:25.940]   They have no first amendment.
[02:16:25.940 --> 02:16:26.940]   Right.
[02:16:26.940 --> 02:16:27.940]   I get it.
[02:16:27.940 --> 02:16:34.220]   I tend to fall more on the side of, say, libertarian, where I get, "Look, just put everything out
[02:16:34.220 --> 02:16:39.220]   there and give people the tools that they need to cut things down on their own.
[02:16:39.220 --> 02:16:43.300]   But as I get older, I realize that doesn't always work."
[02:16:43.300 --> 02:16:50.340]   So there's got to be some sort of happy medium that is constantly shifting between blocking
[02:16:50.340 --> 02:16:56.700]   out content that is definitely 100% designed to provoke and incite and allowing brisk
[02:16:56.700 --> 02:16:57.700]   discourse.
[02:16:57.700 --> 02:17:01.300]   So Microsoft, a number of viewers ago, created some technology called photo DNA, which they
[02:17:01.300 --> 02:17:03.580]   gave to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.
[02:17:03.580 --> 02:17:06.980]   He's a board I just recently resigned from, retired from.
[02:17:06.980 --> 02:17:12.620]   And that technology allows them to basically hash specific illegal child exploitation
[02:17:12.620 --> 02:17:16.580]   issue images so that they can't be reposted.
[02:17:16.580 --> 02:17:21.500]   If Facebook could act quickly enough, for example, let's say Facebook, all of these services,
[02:17:21.500 --> 02:17:23.660]   for example, and hash that video.
[02:17:23.660 --> 02:17:24.660]   They do.
[02:17:24.660 --> 02:17:28.220]   Well, they had it hashed within 20 minutes.
[02:17:28.220 --> 02:17:32.540]   But the trouble is that the people who amplify it are aware of how the hashing works.
[02:17:32.540 --> 02:17:33.540]   Yeah.
[02:17:33.540 --> 02:17:34.540]   And so they've used to--
[02:17:34.540 --> 02:17:35.540]   You've muted the video.
[02:17:35.540 --> 02:17:37.620]   They subtly alter the video.
[02:17:37.620 --> 02:17:44.180]   They'll do a-- hold up an iPad to your screen and take a picture of it and do a video of
[02:17:44.180 --> 02:17:46.420]   it and then post that.
[02:17:46.420 --> 02:17:53.180]   So the-- yeah, for every way that you have to block it, the people who are determined
[02:17:53.180 --> 02:17:55.820]   to go around the blocks are going to do that.
[02:17:55.820 --> 02:18:00.460]   Well, with photo DNA, at least with still images, you can pretty much defeat that getting
[02:18:00.460 --> 02:18:03.500]   around it because they don't just hash the actual file.
[02:18:03.500 --> 02:18:08.020]   They hash characteristics of the file that can be blocked even if the file has been modified.
[02:18:08.020 --> 02:18:09.980]   I'm not saying they have to do it around.
[02:18:09.980 --> 02:18:15.020]   And they've done some things with it using audio, for example, to fingerprint.
[02:18:15.020 --> 02:18:17.900]   I think they'll have Facebook first blocked that video.
[02:18:17.900 --> 02:18:20.500]   They used audio rather than video.
[02:18:20.500 --> 02:18:21.500]   It's a block.
[02:18:21.500 --> 02:18:22.500]   Yeah, audio can be blocked.
[02:18:22.500 --> 02:18:23.500]   I mean, we know.
[02:18:23.500 --> 02:18:24.500]   We know it's challenging.
[02:18:24.500 --> 02:18:28.100]   And some people have called for the end of Facebook Live and other live streaming things.
[02:18:28.100 --> 02:18:29.980]   I don't think that's the solution I've booked on that.
[02:18:29.980 --> 02:18:32.460]   I think live streaming is-- I mean, we're doing it right now.
[02:18:32.460 --> 02:18:35.060]   I think it's really great.
[02:18:35.060 --> 02:18:44.900]   But there was a quote, "When Facebook Live was introduced, Mark Zuckerberg at the
[02:18:44.900 --> 02:18:51.540]   launch of it said, 'This is--' I think I'm going to have this quote right.
[02:18:51.540 --> 02:18:56.860]   He said, 'This is going to be something like a game changer.'
[02:18:56.860 --> 02:19:01.440]   But the thing, he said, 'We really see this being a way for people to communicate things
[02:19:01.440 --> 02:19:03.100]   that are raw and visceral.
[02:19:03.100 --> 02:19:04.100]   Use those words.'
[02:19:04.100 --> 02:19:06.100]   Yeah, it was words.
[02:19:06.100 --> 02:19:07.100]   You nailed it.
[02:19:07.100 --> 02:19:08.100]   Yeah.
[02:19:08.100 --> 02:19:19.660]   And so anybody who wasn't economically incentivized, who heard that, should have gone, 'Whoa,
[02:19:19.660 --> 02:19:25.620]   whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait just a second, let's just take the logical steps.
[02:19:25.620 --> 02:19:30.180]   Let's follow the recommendation engine and see where this takes us.'
[02:19:30.180 --> 02:19:31.180]   You could have predicted it.
[02:19:31.180 --> 02:19:32.180]   Oh, yeah.
[02:19:32.180 --> 02:19:33.180]   No, it was predicted.
[02:19:33.180 --> 02:19:35.660]   I mean, people talked about that day one when it came out.
[02:19:35.660 --> 02:19:36.660]   There was concern.
[02:19:36.660 --> 02:19:37.660]   You know--
[02:19:37.660 --> 02:19:39.100]   No, I don't think they should have done it.
[02:19:39.100 --> 02:19:42.140]   I think that there's a lot of legitimate uses of it.
[02:19:42.140 --> 02:19:46.860]   But there needs to be a better-- I mean, they've got to get the AI working.
[02:19:46.860 --> 02:19:53.020]   They've got to figure out a way to successfully at least flag inappropriate or suspicious content
[02:19:53.020 --> 02:19:56.540]   and then have moderators immediately look at it and immediately respond.
[02:19:56.540 --> 02:19:59.660]   And I mean, they could have done a better job than waiting for the New Zealand police
[02:19:59.660 --> 02:20:02.180]   to call them 17 minutes later to take that down.
[02:20:02.180 --> 02:20:03.180]   That would happen?
[02:20:03.180 --> 02:20:04.180]   Yeah, that's what happened.
[02:20:04.180 --> 02:20:08.860]   You know, on the other hand, and this is no defense of what happened on Facebook, but
[02:20:08.860 --> 02:20:13.460]   the real story here that 50 people died, I mean, that's the story more than the fact
[02:20:13.460 --> 02:20:19.180]   that a disgusting video got seen, not to say that the video wasn't horrible and part of
[02:20:19.180 --> 02:20:22.060]   the propaganda that this guy was using.
[02:20:22.060 --> 02:20:23.860]   And triggers the next generation.
[02:20:23.860 --> 02:20:24.860]   Well, that's the--
[02:20:24.860 --> 02:20:26.420]   My problem, it glorifies it.
[02:20:26.420 --> 02:20:31.780]   It becomes a way of creating new killers.
[02:20:31.780 --> 02:20:32.780]   That's very similar.
[02:20:32.780 --> 02:20:36.500]   I'm going to say something that's going to sound incredibly callous and just know that
[02:20:36.500 --> 02:20:37.740]   that's not my intention.
[02:20:37.740 --> 02:20:40.820]   My intention is to put this in the proper frame.
[02:20:40.820 --> 02:20:42.380]   That was content.
[02:20:42.380 --> 02:20:45.420]   It was despicable content, but it was content.
[02:20:45.420 --> 02:20:49.860]   And it did what everyone wants their content to do, which is to spark emotion and therefore
[02:20:49.860 --> 02:20:51.860]   gather heat on the internet.
[02:20:51.860 --> 02:20:53.180]   So no surprise it got reshared.
[02:20:53.180 --> 02:20:55.420]   So it's no surprise it got reshared.
[02:20:55.420 --> 02:21:00.020]   I in no way, shape or form, think that that's the kind of content that should drive the internet,
[02:21:00.020 --> 02:21:01.020]   but it does.
[02:21:01.020 --> 02:21:02.020]   So until you consult for that--
[02:21:02.020 --> 02:21:03.020]   Yeah, that's a real problem.
[02:21:03.020 --> 02:21:05.020]   No algorithm and no AI is going to fix it.
[02:21:05.020 --> 02:21:06.020]   But don't you want that.
[02:21:06.020 --> 02:21:07.020]   We want to see that.
[02:21:07.020 --> 02:21:08.020]   It's the correct.
[02:21:08.020 --> 02:21:10.180]   Don't you have an organization that considers certain content to be sinful?
[02:21:10.180 --> 02:21:11.180]   Absolutely.
[02:21:11.180 --> 02:21:15.820]   And that's why I'm saying-- but this until we come to a point at which we can say--
[02:21:15.820 --> 02:21:16.820]   It's sinful content.
[02:21:16.820 --> 02:21:18.220]   But we love it.
[02:21:18.220 --> 02:21:19.220]   Yeah.
[02:21:19.220 --> 02:21:20.220]   We love it.
[02:21:20.220 --> 02:21:22.420]   Otherwise, would there be Kardashians?
[02:21:22.420 --> 02:21:24.420]   I think not.
[02:21:24.420 --> 02:21:25.420]   Let's--
[02:21:25.420 --> 02:21:27.220]   Let's have to have the Pope.
[02:21:27.220 --> 02:21:28.220]   I have still--
[02:21:28.220 --> 02:21:29.700]   Why is the Pope have an opinion on that?
[02:21:29.700 --> 02:21:30.700]   I have never seen the Kardashians.
[02:21:30.700 --> 02:21:31.700]   I don't even know what they look like.
[02:21:31.700 --> 02:21:32.700]   I don't know.
[02:21:32.700 --> 02:21:33.780]   One of them is married to Kanye West.
[02:21:33.780 --> 02:21:38.340]   I just know we can thank the Kardashians for the fact that people walk around town talking
[02:21:38.340 --> 02:21:39.820]   into their phone like this.
[02:21:39.820 --> 02:21:40.820]   Wait, really?
[02:21:40.820 --> 02:21:41.820]   With the speaker on.
[02:21:41.820 --> 02:21:42.820]   Oh, that's the same thing?
[02:21:42.820 --> 02:21:43.820]   Yes, you know why?
[02:21:43.820 --> 02:21:47.140]   Because it was reality TV and they needed the camera to hear the other end of the conversation
[02:21:47.140 --> 02:21:49.260]   so they put the person on speakerphone and talk to it.
[02:21:49.260 --> 02:21:53.140]   But somehow it became the right way to use a smartphone, which means there's people
[02:21:53.140 --> 02:21:54.140]   all over.
[02:21:54.140 --> 02:21:55.140]   You've seen this.
[02:21:55.140 --> 02:21:56.140]   I bet in Rome it's an epidemic.
[02:21:56.140 --> 02:21:57.140]   People are walking around.
[02:21:57.140 --> 02:21:58.940]   You can hear both ends of the conversation.
[02:21:58.940 --> 02:21:59.940]   Bad enough.
[02:21:59.940 --> 02:22:01.180]   You can hear just one end.
[02:22:01.180 --> 02:22:02.180]   No, you hear both doofuses.
[02:22:02.180 --> 02:22:03.180]   You're not supposed to round up.
[02:22:03.180 --> 02:22:04.180]   I've never seen you.
[02:22:04.180 --> 02:22:05.180]   Sorry.
[02:22:05.180 --> 02:22:07.180]   This is like a reality TV.
[02:22:07.180 --> 02:22:08.180]   This is like a terrible--
[02:22:08.180 --> 02:22:09.180]   Get off my lawn.
[02:22:09.180 --> 02:22:11.180]   Get off of my lawn.
[02:22:11.180 --> 02:22:18.300]   I showed they brought to you by Cap Terra if you are in business and you know you've got
[02:22:18.300 --> 02:22:19.980]   this line of business software.
[02:22:19.980 --> 02:22:20.980]   You use it every day.
[02:22:20.980 --> 02:22:22.380]   I'll never forget.
[02:22:22.380 --> 02:22:27.540]   I started working at a radio station in San Francisco, KNBR as the music director.
[02:22:27.540 --> 02:22:30.340]   And I go in the door and I'm expecting-- because I had written databases.
[02:22:30.340 --> 02:22:34.780]   I had written nice modern PC programs to do the music rotation.
[02:22:34.780 --> 02:22:36.340]   I walk in the door.
[02:22:36.340 --> 02:22:42.460]   There sits on the ground because it's the size of a mini fridge, a PDP 11 with a giant
[02:22:42.460 --> 02:22:46.420]   eight and a half inch floppy that's the music generation program.
[02:22:46.420 --> 02:22:50.340]   You stick the floppy and you close the door and goes, the head goes, "Chonk."
[02:22:50.340 --> 02:22:55.100]   And it prints out on a teletype practically, the playlist.
[02:22:55.100 --> 02:22:57.740]   They've been using it for probably 20 years.
[02:22:57.740 --> 02:23:00.180]   This is 1984.
[02:23:00.180 --> 02:23:03.740]   The first thing I did was I don't know how it happened, but somehow that floppy stopped
[02:23:03.740 --> 02:23:04.740]   working.
[02:23:04.740 --> 02:23:08.220]   And we had to go out and buy a modern computer to do it.
[02:23:08.220 --> 02:23:12.660]   You know this, if you work in business, there is some program that's been there for 20 years.
[02:23:12.660 --> 02:23:15.740]   You have to keep running Windows NT because nothing else will run it.
[02:23:15.740 --> 02:23:17.300]   You're using Internet Explorer.
[02:23:17.300 --> 02:23:20.120]   It's time for some modern software.
[02:23:20.120 --> 02:23:23.300]   There is almost certainly a better program out there, but where do you find it?
[02:23:23.300 --> 02:23:24.300]   You Google it?
[02:23:24.300 --> 02:23:25.300]   No.
[02:23:25.300 --> 02:23:26.460]   You go to Cap Terra.
[02:23:26.460 --> 02:23:31.620]   Cap Terra will help you find the perfect tools to make the right decision for software for
[02:23:31.620 --> 02:23:33.780]   your business.
[02:23:33.780 --> 02:23:38.820]   Whether it's running a veterinarian office or sending out marketing emails, managing
[02:23:38.820 --> 02:23:45.980]   your projects, designing 12 story office towers, to managing a yoga studio, Cap Terra's got
[02:23:45.980 --> 02:23:53.860]   it, 700 categories of software, thousands of different programs, and best of all, 750,000
[02:23:53.860 --> 02:23:56.940]   reviews of products from people who actually use it.
[02:23:56.940 --> 02:24:00.980]   Cap Terra vets all those reviews and make sure they're all real users.
[02:24:00.980 --> 02:24:06.140]   So you can go to capterra.com/twid and find exactly the software you need.
[02:24:06.140 --> 02:24:10.660]   The boss says to you, "Tomorrow I want you to come in with five great programs for running
[02:24:10.660 --> 02:24:12.220]   our dental office."
[02:24:12.220 --> 02:24:14.860]   You go to capterra.com, you check the boxes for what you need.
[02:24:14.860 --> 02:24:15.860]   You want it to run on the web.
[02:24:15.860 --> 02:24:16.860]   You want it to run locally.
[02:24:16.860 --> 02:24:19.020]   Do you want to be able to book clients, patients?
[02:24:19.020 --> 02:24:20.820]   Do you want to manage the schedule?
[02:24:20.820 --> 02:24:21.820]   Do you want to order products?
[02:24:21.820 --> 02:24:22.820]   What do you need?
[02:24:22.820 --> 02:24:25.280]   You want to do it to make sure you have the information.
[02:24:25.280 --> 02:24:27.280]   I can't wait to see if there's no information.
[02:24:27.280 --> 02:24:30.980]   I can't wait to see how much of your product is going to be.
[02:24:30.980 --> 02:24:33.400]   I can't wait to see how much of your product is going to be.
[02:24:33.400 --> 02:24:35.480]   I can't wait to see how much of your product is going to be.
[02:24:35.480 --> 02:24:38.480]   I can't wait to see how much of your product is going to be.
[02:24:38.480 --> 02:24:41.460]   I can't wait to see how much of your product is going to be.
[02:24:41.460 --> 02:24:44.440]   I can't wait to see how much of your product is going to be.
[02:24:44.440 --> 02:24:47.400]   I can't wait to see how much of your product is going to be.
[02:24:47.400 --> 02:24:49.400]   You can see how much of your product is going to be.
[02:24:49.400 --> 02:24:53.400]   I can't wait to see how much of your product is going to be.
[02:24:53.400 --> 02:24:56.400]   I can't wait to see how much of your product is going to be.
[02:24:56.400 --> 02:24:59.400]   I can't wait to see how much of your product is going to be.
[02:24:59.400 --> 02:25:02.400]   I can't wait to see how much of your product is going to be.
[02:25:02.400 --> 02:25:05.400]   I can't wait to see how much of your product is going to be.
[02:25:05.400 --> 02:25:08.400]   I can't wait to see how much of your product is going to be.
[02:25:08.400 --> 02:25:11.400]   I can't wait to see how much of your product is going to be.
[02:25:11.400 --> 02:25:14.400]   I can't wait to see how much of your product is going to be.
[02:25:14.400 --> 02:25:17.400]   I can't wait to see how much of your product is going to be.
[02:25:17.400 --> 02:25:20.400]   I can't wait to see how much of your product is going to be.
[02:25:20.400 --> 02:25:23.400]   I can't wait to see how much of your product is going to be.
[02:25:23.400 --> 02:25:26.400]   I can't wait to see how much of your product is going to be.
[02:25:26.400 --> 02:25:29.400]   I can't wait to see how much of your product is going to be.
[02:25:29.400 --> 02:25:32.400]   I can't wait to see how much of your product is going to be.
[02:25:32.400 --> 02:25:35.400]   I can't wait to see how much of your product is going to be.
[02:25:35.400 --> 02:25:38.400]   I can't wait to see how much of your product is going to be.
[02:25:38.400 --> 02:25:41.400]   I can't wait to see how much of your product is going to be.
[02:25:41.400 --> 02:25:44.400]   I can't wait to see how much of your product is going to be.
[02:25:44.400 --> 02:25:46.400]   I can't wait to see how much of your product is going to be.
[02:25:46.400 --> 02:25:48.400]   He was busy playing golf with Kid Rock.
[02:25:48.400 --> 02:25:49.400]   But why would you say that?
[02:25:49.400 --> 02:25:52.400]   Which is the strangest picture I've ever seen in my life.
[02:25:52.400 --> 02:25:54.400]   Why would the middle of a victory lap?
[02:25:54.400 --> 02:25:58.400]   I think he had the right to take at the moment for short term.
[02:25:58.400 --> 02:26:02.400]   Why would he put something that's patently false that totally contradicts?
[02:26:02.400 --> 02:26:05.400]   Why would anything nutty on Twitter?
[02:26:05.400 --> 02:26:06.400]   Wait a minute.
[02:26:06.400 --> 02:26:07.400]   I'm sorry, Larry.
[02:26:07.400 --> 02:26:11.400]   You're saying Donald Trump said something untrue?
[02:26:11.400 --> 02:26:12.400]   Yeah, shock.
[02:26:12.400 --> 02:26:13.400]   I know.
[02:26:13.400 --> 02:26:14.400]   Undepressive.
[02:26:14.400 --> 02:26:23.400]   If you say it enough, if you say it enough, if you say it enough, if you say it enough, it's true.
[02:26:23.400 --> 02:26:29.400]   Remember at the beginning of the show I said anyone who's immediately saying one side of the other of the extreme?
[02:26:29.400 --> 02:26:31.400]   Well, you knew what was coming, obviously.
[02:26:31.400 --> 02:26:33.400]   No, but I didn't expect it to be so little.
[02:26:33.400 --> 02:26:35.400]   And it's an all upper case.
[02:26:35.400 --> 02:26:37.400]   Totally expected that.
[02:26:37.400 --> 02:26:39.400]   That should be the word.
[02:26:39.400 --> 02:26:41.400]   He's had that tweet queued up and readied it.
[02:26:41.400 --> 02:26:43.400]   He probably put it in Hootsuite last year.
[02:26:43.400 --> 02:26:48.400]   He's had that tweet has been queued up and ready to fire.
[02:26:48.400 --> 02:26:49.400]   All right.
[02:26:49.400 --> 02:26:53.400]   Ladies and gentlemen, let's conclude our broadcast day.
[02:26:53.400 --> 02:26:55.400]   Ed bot, I love you.
[02:26:55.400 --> 02:26:58.400]   I love your Wilco poster.
[02:26:58.400 --> 02:27:00.400]   I want you on our show every week.
[02:27:00.400 --> 02:27:02.400]   You're just the greatest Ed bot report on ZDnet.
[02:27:02.400 --> 02:27:03.400]   Thank you.
[02:27:03.400 --> 02:27:04.400]   Ed bot on Twitter.
[02:27:04.400 --> 02:27:07.400]   Well, you're just sensible.
[02:27:07.400 --> 02:27:11.400]   When I get all head up about stuff, you calm me down.
[02:27:11.400 --> 02:27:13.400]   You're talking me off the ledge.
[02:27:13.400 --> 02:27:15.400]   And he's always been sensible.
[02:27:15.400 --> 02:27:17.400]   And I hate you for that.
[02:27:17.400 --> 02:27:18.400]   No, I'm kidding.
[02:27:18.400 --> 02:27:20.400]   Thank you, Ed, for being here.
[02:27:20.400 --> 02:27:22.400]   Have a great afternoon and evening and sense of faith.
[02:27:22.400 --> 02:27:24.400]   He also married well, too.
[02:27:24.400 --> 02:27:25.400]   I don't know his wife.
[02:27:25.400 --> 02:27:26.400]   I know his wife, honestly.
[02:27:26.400 --> 02:27:28.400]   I knew her when she was a PR person.
[02:27:28.400 --> 02:27:29.400]   A year ago.
[02:27:29.400 --> 02:27:32.400]   Judy is a treasure.
[02:27:32.400 --> 02:27:39.400]   It'll be 25 years since December is when I met her.
[02:27:39.400 --> 02:27:41.400]   And it's been a great...
[02:27:41.400 --> 02:27:43.400]   I think I've known her longer than you have.
[02:27:43.400 --> 02:27:45.400]   That's kind of scary.
[02:27:45.400 --> 02:27:56.400]   We have a picture of ourselves standing back to back at an event in Silicon Valley, taken three years before we met.
[02:27:56.400 --> 02:27:57.400]   Wow.
[02:27:57.400 --> 02:28:02.400]   We were going through a box of photographs that she had and pulls this one out.
[02:28:02.400 --> 02:28:05.400]   She looks at it and says, "What?"
[02:28:05.400 --> 02:28:06.400]   There you are.
[02:28:06.400 --> 02:28:10.400]   I was studiously ignoring you, Ed.
[02:28:10.400 --> 02:28:13.400]   Mr. Larry Maggad.
[02:28:13.400 --> 02:28:18.400]   He is every morning, bright and early, at CBS News Radio, which is all over the country.
[02:28:18.400 --> 02:28:21.400]   KCBS here in San Francisco, WCBS in New York City.
[02:28:21.400 --> 02:28:25.400]   CBS, I didn't realize this, is the number two radio group in the country.
[02:28:25.400 --> 02:28:26.400]   I didn't even know that.
[02:28:26.400 --> 02:28:27.400]   Right after Claire Channel.
[02:28:27.400 --> 02:28:28.400]   We have a lot of affiliates, though.
[02:28:28.400 --> 02:28:29.400]   Yeah, it's huge.
[02:28:29.400 --> 02:28:37.400]   And if you want to read his work to save kids, to keep them safe online, connect safely.
[02:28:37.400 --> 02:28:39.400]   There's lots of great resources there.
[02:28:39.400 --> 02:28:42.400]   And I'm going to launch Larryathworld.com/twit.
[02:28:42.400 --> 02:28:44.400]   I don't know what I'm going to put there, but I feel jealous.
[02:28:44.400 --> 02:28:46.400]   I have no Twitter subdomain.
[02:28:46.400 --> 02:28:47.400]   You need a Twitter subdomain.
[02:28:47.400 --> 02:28:48.400]   You're going to offer code.
[02:28:48.400 --> 02:28:50.400]   10% off on the free access to my...
[02:28:50.400 --> 02:28:51.400]   Exactly.
[02:28:51.400 --> 02:28:52.400]   I pay you.
[02:28:52.400 --> 02:28:53.400]   There's the offer code.
[02:28:53.400 --> 02:28:54.400]   All right.
[02:28:54.400 --> 02:28:55.400]   He's giving it away, folks.
[02:28:55.400 --> 02:28:58.400]   Mr. Father Reverend Robert Ballisare.
[02:28:58.400 --> 02:28:59.400]   The digital Jesuit.
[02:28:59.400 --> 02:29:00.400]   Father Robert.
[02:29:00.400 --> 02:29:02.400]   It's so nice to see you.
[02:29:02.400 --> 02:29:07.400]   Honestly, I wish we hadn't said goodbye to you all those months ago in the past.
[02:29:07.400 --> 02:29:09.400]   You knew I was going to come back.
[02:29:09.400 --> 02:29:10.400]   We can't get rid of you.
[02:29:10.400 --> 02:29:11.400]   I know.
[02:29:11.400 --> 02:29:12.400]   At Penny's.
[02:29:12.400 --> 02:29:13.400]   No, we love you.
[02:29:13.400 --> 02:29:15.400]   And it's great to see you come back again.
[02:29:15.400 --> 02:29:17.400]   You'll be back for DEF CON probably next time, right?
[02:29:17.400 --> 02:29:22.400]   Actually, I'm coming back for most of April because I have to do surgery for a cataract.
[02:29:22.400 --> 02:29:23.400]   Oh, no.
[02:29:23.400 --> 02:29:24.400]   So we have a cataract.
[02:29:24.400 --> 02:29:25.400]   I have a cataract.
[02:29:25.400 --> 02:29:26.400]   You too young to have a cataract.
[02:29:26.400 --> 02:29:28.400]   I know it's a family thing.
[02:29:28.400 --> 02:29:29.400]   Sorry.
[02:29:29.400 --> 02:29:34.120]   But yeah, they won't let me fly for a while after that because I have to do a couple of
[02:29:34.120 --> 02:29:35.120]   appointments.
[02:29:35.120 --> 02:29:36.120]   Oh, so you're going to miss DEF CON this year?
[02:29:36.120 --> 02:29:37.120]   No, no.
[02:29:37.120 --> 02:29:38.120]   I will be here for DEF CON.
[02:29:38.120 --> 02:29:39.120]   Oh, you have to stay here.
[02:29:39.120 --> 02:29:40.120]   Just for April.
[02:29:40.120 --> 02:29:41.120]   And then I'll be back.
[02:29:41.120 --> 02:29:42.120]   I get it.
[02:29:42.120 --> 02:29:44.200]   You couldn't have the surgery in Italy, but then you'd be stuck with the spaghetti.
[02:29:44.200 --> 02:29:45.200]   So you're going to come here.
[02:29:45.200 --> 02:29:46.200]   No, no, no.
[02:29:46.200 --> 02:29:50.280]   The problem with doing it in Italy is because I just got there, it will take me at least
[02:29:50.280 --> 02:29:54.280]   a year to schedule the surgery.
[02:29:54.280 --> 02:29:55.280]   You can do it there fine.
[02:29:55.280 --> 02:30:00.160]   It's not a problem, but I kind of need to stay in care of now because I'm blind in my right
[02:30:00.160 --> 02:30:01.840]   eye and it's really affecting LA.
[02:30:01.840 --> 02:30:02.840]   Robert, I had no idea.
[02:30:02.840 --> 02:30:03.840]   I'm sorry.
[02:30:03.840 --> 02:30:04.840]   Will you be all better after the surgery?
[02:30:04.840 --> 02:30:05.840]   Oh, yeah.
[02:30:05.840 --> 02:30:06.840]   They just kind of have to be me.
[02:30:06.840 --> 02:30:07.840]   So that's a problem.
[02:30:07.840 --> 02:30:08.840]   But I'll see you better.
[02:30:08.840 --> 02:30:09.840]   You be on play the piano?
[02:30:09.840 --> 02:30:10.840]   Yeah.
[02:30:10.840 --> 02:30:12.840]   Well, can I be able to play the guitar?
[02:30:12.840 --> 02:30:14.840]   Get a nice eyepatch and we'll see you in April.
[02:30:14.840 --> 02:30:15.840]   How about that?
[02:30:15.840 --> 02:30:16.840]   Yeah.
[02:30:16.840 --> 02:30:17.840]   That would be really nice to know that you can.
[02:30:17.840 --> 02:30:18.840]   Can you come up and do that?
[02:30:18.840 --> 02:30:20.920]   You can't fly, but you could drive.
[02:30:20.920 --> 02:30:21.920]   I can drive.
[02:30:21.920 --> 02:30:22.920]   Sure.
[02:30:22.920 --> 02:30:23.920]   What could go wrong?
[02:30:23.920 --> 02:30:24.920]   It's not a Lexic itself drive.
[02:30:24.920 --> 02:30:26.920]   You can drive up here and drive back.
[02:30:26.920 --> 02:30:27.920]   Absolutely.
[02:30:27.920 --> 02:30:30.160]   And then it will crash because someone hacked it.
[02:30:30.160 --> 02:30:36.960]   We wind up the show with this small video of the CEO of AT&T, Randall Stevenson, speaking
[02:30:36.960 --> 02:30:39.080]   at the Economic Club.
[02:30:39.080 --> 02:30:45.200]   Oh, you know, I got to turn off all the things that prevent me from playing videos back here.
[02:30:45.200 --> 02:30:47.080]   Here we'll do it one more time.
[02:30:47.080 --> 02:30:48.920]   It's a great story.
[02:30:48.920 --> 02:30:51.480]   We were the CFO for many of that.
[02:30:51.480 --> 02:30:53.560]   I was, yeah, for a lot of that.
[02:30:53.560 --> 02:30:55.880]   And I'm getting a robocall to the guy.
[02:30:55.880 --> 02:30:57.400]   You get a message now right now?
[02:30:57.400 --> 02:30:59.680]   He's getting a robocall on his Apple Watch.
[02:30:59.680 --> 02:31:03.240]   So literally, you're looking for him from President Trump or somebody?
[02:31:03.240 --> 02:31:04.240]   No.
[02:31:04.240 --> 02:31:06.840]   Somebody wants to tell him a time share in a beautiful Hawaii.
[02:31:06.840 --> 02:31:09.680]   So only if there was a company that could fly the way to block that.
[02:31:09.680 --> 02:31:11.760]   AT&T, if only there were a way.
[02:31:11.760 --> 02:31:17.000]   How, you know, it's that robocall could be from, I wonder if it's from John Oliver.
[02:31:17.000 --> 02:31:19.000]   Wouldn't that be hysterical?
[02:31:19.000 --> 02:31:21.320]   Or even Kevin Nune's mom.
[02:31:21.320 --> 02:31:24.560]   Kevin Nune's mom or cow?
[02:31:24.560 --> 02:31:25.560]   Robocall.
[02:31:25.560 --> 02:31:26.560]   Robocall.
[02:31:26.560 --> 02:31:27.920]   Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for being here.
[02:31:27.920 --> 02:31:30.520]   We do tweet every Sunday afternoon.
[02:31:30.520 --> 02:31:35.120]   We've moved the time up a little bit, although we just, that just meant let us make the show
[02:31:35.120 --> 02:31:36.120]   longer.
[02:31:36.120 --> 02:31:38.200]   So really gained nothing.
[02:31:38.200 --> 02:31:40.680]   215 Pacific 515 Eastern.
[02:31:40.680 --> 02:31:42.720]   That's 2115 UTC.
[02:31:42.720 --> 02:31:45.120]   If you want to watch live, you can go to twit.tv/live.
[02:31:45.120 --> 02:31:46.120]   You can listen live too.
[02:31:46.120 --> 02:31:47.640]   We've got two audio streams there.
[02:31:47.640 --> 02:31:50.960]   If you'd like to join us in studio, we had a great studio audience.
[02:31:50.960 --> 02:31:56.280]   People from all over, Manchester, New Hampshire.
[02:31:56.280 --> 02:32:02.240]   We had Florida, Toronto, and Fort Worth, where the West begins.
[02:32:02.240 --> 02:32:08.240]   If you want to be part of our studio audience, just email tickets at twit.tv so we can put
[02:32:08.240 --> 02:32:09.680]   an uncomfortable chair out for you.
[02:32:09.680 --> 02:32:10.840]   We've done pretty well, right?
[02:32:10.840 --> 02:32:11.840]   Nice, uncomfortable.
[02:32:11.840 --> 02:32:12.840]   Yeah, good.
[02:32:12.840 --> 02:32:17.040]   See what, I'm a little bit of a sadist.
[02:32:17.040 --> 02:32:20.880]   We get the most uncomfortable chair we can, and then we make the show as long as possible.
[02:32:20.880 --> 02:32:22.360]   And it's fun to watch.
[02:32:22.360 --> 02:32:25.200]   We've also been pumping neurotoxin into the studio.
[02:32:25.200 --> 02:32:26.200]   Enjoy.
[02:32:26.200 --> 02:32:27.200]   That explains a lot.
[02:32:27.200 --> 02:32:32.080]   If you can't watch live, we've got on-demand versions of the show, audio and video at twit.tv.
[02:32:32.080 --> 02:32:33.720]   That's our website.
[02:32:33.720 --> 02:32:34.720]   Best of all.
[02:32:34.720 --> 02:32:36.000]   Hey, look, there's Father Robert.
[02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:39.560]   Hey, you are also wearing the same shirt you wore last time.
[02:32:39.560 --> 02:32:41.720]   And the thing is, it is literally the same shirt.
[02:32:41.720 --> 02:32:44.240]   I've not watched this from day one to it.
[02:32:44.240 --> 02:32:45.800]   This actually started off white.
[02:32:45.800 --> 02:32:50.720]   Last week, Ian was really upset because he's wearing the same shirt that he wore in this
[02:32:50.720 --> 02:32:53.480]   picture at the top of the page at twit.tv.
[02:32:53.480 --> 02:32:55.560]   And then I pointed out, well, that's okay because Robert is.
[02:32:55.560 --> 02:32:57.400]   And in fact, I was as well.
[02:32:57.400 --> 02:32:58.400]   It's a uniform.
[02:32:58.400 --> 02:32:59.400]   Yeah.
[02:32:59.400 --> 02:33:00.400]   No, you have to wear it.
[02:33:00.400 --> 02:33:01.400]   It's part of the deal.
[02:33:01.400 --> 02:33:02.400]   Yeah.
[02:33:02.400 --> 02:33:05.360]   Twit.tv or subscribe in your favorite podcast application.
[02:33:05.360 --> 02:33:06.920]   And that way you get a copy of it.
[02:33:06.920 --> 02:33:10.600]   The minute it's available, plenty of time for your Monday morning commute.
[02:33:10.600 --> 02:33:13.480]   We'll be back here tomorrow, 10 a.m.
[02:33:13.480 --> 02:33:14.840]   Pacific.
[02:33:14.840 --> 02:33:22.440]   That's 1 p.m. Eastern time, 1700 UTC for the big apple pivot.
[02:33:22.440 --> 02:33:30.080]   Should be a very interesting stream and we'll be and we'll stay up as long as we can.
[02:33:30.080 --> 02:33:32.600]   So we're taking bets now.
[02:33:32.600 --> 02:33:37.080]   We got the charts, the bingo chart already, if anybody wants to make a wager as to how
[02:33:37.080 --> 02:33:38.080]   long.
[02:33:38.080 --> 02:33:39.080]   Thanks for joining us.
[02:33:39.080 --> 02:33:40.080]   We'll see you next time.
[02:33:40.080 --> 02:33:42.080]   Another twit is in the camera.
[02:33:42.080 --> 02:33:43.080]   Bye.
[02:33:43.080 --> 02:33:45.080]   [Music]
[02:33:45.080 --> 02:33:46.080]   I want a twit.
[02:33:46.080 --> 02:33:47.080]   Do you want a twit?
[02:33:47.080 --> 02:33:48.080]   All right.
[02:33:48.080 --> 02:33:49.080]   Do you want a twit, baby?
[02:33:49.080 --> 02:33:50.080]   Do you want a twit?
[02:33:50.080 --> 02:33:51.080]   All right.
[02:33:51.080 --> 02:33:52.080]   Do you want a twit?
