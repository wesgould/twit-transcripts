[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   This is Twit, this weekend tech, episode 48 for April 2nd, 2006.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Apple's 30th anniversary.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   [Music]
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   Hi, this is Leo LaPorte and I'd like to welcome you to a special edition of this weekend tech.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   And no news, a new crew, we're going to talk a little bit about the 30th anniversary of Apple computer
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   and with it of course the 30th anniversary of the personal computer revolution.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   Don't worry, the regular cast of Twits will reassemble next week for our usual broadcast.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   We do want to thank our friends at AOL Radio for providing us with the bandwidth for this podcast at AOL.com/podcasting.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   And now, to commemorate the 30th anniversary of Apple computer, Steve Wozniak, Andy Hertzfeld, Randy Wiginton,
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   Bill Fernandez and Dan Kocky.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   Hey Bill, how you doing?
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   Excellent, good to hear you.

[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   Hi guys, hey Bill.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   So first of all, happy anniversary.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   Let me probably should introduce in order of Apple employee ID number and I think Bill, you'd probably get the pride of place until Woz gets here.

[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:46.720]   I started describing a bunch of mine because I had just done dozens of pranks and he described
[00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:51.000]   some of his client going into the tunnels under the school and finding phone lines.
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   That was real.
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   Did you know at the time?
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:58.640]   This wouldn't be sizing up people in the kind of macho male sense of who's more powerful.
[00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:01.000]   This would be more in finding points of commonality.
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   Yes.
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:03.680]   That was how we got together.
[00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:08.120]   We sort of had common interests in pranks that we could both laugh at the same things.
[00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:09.480]   We talked about music.
[00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:15.360]   We both liked the same music for the same reason, the wordy type folk stuff.
[00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:20.000]   We also liked talking electronics and counter chips hooked up in a chain with drivers to
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   drive LED.
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:27.280]   We both done that sort of thing to make displays and things like frequency counters.
[00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:31.000]   There weren't that many people in high school that had been near that sort of thing.
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:32.280]   Personally, hit it off.
[00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:33.280]   Come on, guys.
[00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:35.480]   I'm looking for soap opera stories here.
[00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:36.480]   Big fights.
[00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:39.240]   No, trouble.
[00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:42.200]   It sounds like an almost idyllic time.
[00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:44.120]   You know what?
[00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:45.120]   That's true.
[00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:51.320]   The press always tries to find some way to point and they get things very wrong.
[00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:54.400]   Something was against Apple or against something Apple's doing.
[00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:56.120]   They try to make a fight.
[00:40:56.120 --> 00:41:00.120]   When there isn't any, actually no one's ever seen me argue or fight with Steve Jobs ever
[00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:04.320]   despite the fact he's known for other people saying rough crude things to them, not really
[00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:05.320]   with me.
[00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:08.640]   There are a few unknown incidences, but they're very, very minor.
[00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:12.680]   It's almost like, do we have two slots or eight slots?
[00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:17.840]   And oh, man, if you want two slots, find another computer.
[00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:23.240]   It wasn't because I believe eight slots was critical to our success and growth and it
[00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:24.600]   turned out that it was.
[00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:25.600]   It was for a different reason.
[00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:30.440]   That I had a clever design that two chips decoded, all these address ranges for eight
[00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:31.440]   slots.
[00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:35.600]   Whereas the other approach being used by the all-terre computers, the other little cheap
[00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:37.120]   computers, they weren't really computers.
[00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:40.960]   They were just processors, but they weren't a computer with a keyboard, a programming
[00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:42.760]   language, and enough memory.
[00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:46.520]   But anyway, what they did was they had a bunch of dials on every board you plugged in that
[00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:51.080]   dialed what addresses it had, like a street address, you dial in your address.
[00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:55.920]   This board is going to be address 5A00 and it looks for those addresses with comparator
[00:41:55.920 --> 00:42:01.120]   chips of, it took, you know, for eight slots on that type of computer to take 40 chips
[00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:03.400]   for what I had a clever way to do in two chips.
[00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:06.600]   I think they've been suggested by my friend Alan Baum.
[00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:07.600]   Isn't it?
[00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:11.640]   I remember we did a homebrew segment on the screen.
[00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:14.240]   It was Alan was there and all the old.
[00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:17.640]   Actually, Alan, yeah, Alan was really the only other person who designed part of the
[00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:18.640]   computer software.
[00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:24.800]   We did some of the software of the monitor, Ron, me that is part of the Apple II design.
[00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:25.800]   Isn't it interesting?
[00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:27.040]   We should have him here.
[00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:33.600]   It's kind of interesting, Daniel and Bill, to hear, was, has lost none of his enthusiasm
[00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:34.600]   for this stuff.
[00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:36.800]   I mean, he still loves it, doesn't he?
[00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:37.800]   Oh yeah.
[00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:42.600]   But young kids, young kids that age, young kids that age in high school, I want to encourage
[00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:46.200]   them as much as possible to go out and try to build your own things, you know, because
[00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:49.440]   they're the ones that are going to find the interesting solutions we've never think of.
[00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:52.200]   You know, they're the ones that are going to find the way to get, you know, people to
[00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:55.680]   Mars and, you know, maybe invent devices that make weapons obsolete.
[00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:57.360]   Well, it is, you're right.
[00:42:57.360 --> 00:43:03.280]   We're commemorating really a business event, not a significant technical achievement.
[00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:05.200]   But you have to pick a day.
[00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:08.600]   And as I was saying at the beginning, I think it's more than just the founding of Apple
[00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:09.600]   Computer.
[00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:11.720]   It's really the founding of the personal computer revolution.
[00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:15.520]   I mean, this is, this is, if you're going to pick one day, this is the day it began 30
[00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:16.520]   years ago.
[00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:20.520]   I'm going to look at the start of Apple II at a later date as the, as the key element
[00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:24.040]   and the real corporate corporations coming in 77.
[00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:28.160]   So, so 77, you would say really is the, it's a good, we can do this again in a year.
[00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:31.480]   77 was, would you say was really the beginning?
[00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:32.480]   Was that the really?
[00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:34.560]   Two, two, I have two sides to this one.
[00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:37.840]   Every computer before the Apple I, especially at the low cost of the world, came with one
[00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:41.720]   of those airplane, cockpit, front-houses, switches and whites and rectangular and look
[00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:42.720]   ugly.
[00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:47.560]   Every single computer since the Apple I came with a human keyboard, there was a distinct
[00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:49.960]   split right then that was going to make it happen.
[00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:50.960]   Yeah.
[00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:53.560]   And people were going to figure out, you had to come with a little bit of wrong to run
[00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:54.560]   that sort of a machine.
[00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:58.000]   Well, we used ROMs in our calculators at Hewlett Packard.
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:01.800]   So I had a little advantage when it occurred to me that you could just build in a ROM and
[00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:04.560]   get rid of the front panel and have a human keyboard.
[00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:09.800]   But, you know, but a real computer needed a certain amount of memory enough that you
[00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:12.480]   could sit down and type into a programming language.
[00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:14.560]   To me anything less than that wasn't really a computer.
[00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:18.920]   It was just a processor and a few of us who could read data sheets knew what a processor
[00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:23.080]   was and it's a processor that the alter, it was a processor surrounded by some voltage
[00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:25.400]   resistance protection chips and a bus.
[00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:29.120]   And yeah, if you do enough, you could do a bunch of right things and make it compute.
[00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:30.120]   Well, it took a lot.
[00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:31.880]   Well, of course, it mitts out there and have a computer.
[00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:34.360]   It just had switches on the front and you had a...
[00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:35.360]   Right.
[00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:38.280]   And by the time you got to a computer that could run a programming language, it cost a
[00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:39.640]   lot of money.
[00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:43.480]   The type of RAMs they use, static RAMs were so expensive.
[00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:47.640]   So having a ROM, having a keyboard, having a monitor...
[00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:49.840]   Dynamic RAM was a key also.
[00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:50.840]   Dynamic RAM.
[00:44:50.840 --> 00:44:54.320]   The first 4K dynamic RAM in '75, that was the first time ever.
[00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:56.520]   It was cheaper than cord memory.
[00:44:56.520 --> 00:44:57.520]   Really?
[00:44:57.520 --> 00:44:59.520]   As late as '75, wow.
[00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:06.440]   Yeah, so I jumped right on to that is my God, that's the way to make it affordable.
[00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:08.680]   I was thinking just for myself to afford.
[00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:11.880]   What was the price point that you hope to get this out of?
[00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:15.320]   Oh, I never thought of it as a product when I built it.
[00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:19.680]   I just thought of what I could afford to pay and that was probably up to maybe a couple
[00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:24.840]   hundred bucks or I'd have to wait six months to save 400 bucks.
[00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:27.480]   The amount of money to even buy an all-terre was a lot for me.
[00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:31.240]   A lot of my income was going into a thing I ran called Dialogio.
[00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:32.240]   Yeah.
[00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:35.720]   That was back before you were allowed to own an answering machine or a telephone.
[00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:39.360]   So it cost a ton of money to get the only machine being read by the phone company.
[00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:42.320]   And it really did eat up all my spare money.
[00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:45.960]   Your dedication between computer Dialogio.
[00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:46.960]   Computer Dialogio.
[00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:51.600]   It must have been a tough choice.
[00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:57.000]   Was Waz a prankster in those early days, Bill, do you remember pranks from either Waz or
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   Jobs?
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:01.680]   Well, I remember that Waz was always pulling pranks.
[00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:05.040]   I don't remember any particular ones except for the big one that he and Jobs did together
[00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:10.640]   where they tried to pull a prank on the graduating class of 1972 at Homestead High School.
[00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:11.640]   Tell us about that.
[00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:13.320]   I don't think I've ever read about that.
[00:46:13.320 --> 00:46:16.760]   You know, this is one, a couple of my best pranks ever are two or two or two jobs that
[00:46:16.760 --> 00:46:19.560]   didn't come off, but I'll let Bill tell this one.
[00:46:19.560 --> 00:46:20.560]   Okay.
[00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:27.080]   So the Homestead High School has these big rectangular concrete block two-story buildings.
[00:46:27.080 --> 00:46:32.080]   And behind them they have this, the big soccer field and the bleachers.
[00:46:32.080 --> 00:46:36.720]   And so think of the soccer field where all the parents would be sitting in chairs facing
[00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:40.680]   the bleachers where all the graduating students would be and behind them one of these big
[00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:43.160]   monolithic concrete block buildings.
[00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:44.160]   Okay.
[00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:48.400]   They made this giant canvas flag that was, I don't know, maybe 10 feet wide by eight
[00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:50.040]   feet tall.
[00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:54.800]   And they made it, had it set up with pulleys and ropes so that when everyone was assembled
[00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:59.080]   in the graduating class of the parents were looking out beyond their kids at this building,
[00:46:59.080 --> 00:47:03.880]   the flag would roll down the face of the building and give a pleasant message to the
[00:47:03.880 --> 00:47:04.880]   apparent--
[00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:05.880]   Not exactly.
[00:47:05.880 --> 00:47:06.880]   Well, not exactly.
[00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:08.880]   I can correct that a little.
[00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:14.760]   I would unravel off to the top of this one building as the students exited the graduation.
[00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:20.520]   Half the students, the half coming out of, say, caught the stage right side for the students,
[00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:24.120]   those half the students would see the sign that had a Brazilian best wishes sign.
[00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:27.800]   Although I have to say I talked to some people from Brazil and that was just a phony joke
[00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:29.160]   that Steve and I made up.
[00:47:29.160 --> 00:47:30.160]   I take it.
[00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:31.160]   You're--
[00:47:31.160 --> 00:47:32.160]   We call it flipping off.
[00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:33.160]   We call it a hand flipping them off.
[00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:34.160]   Flipping the best wishes.
[00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:37.080]   So you are saying back with the best wishes on it.
[00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:39.200]   You painted a giant hand--
[00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:42.640]   And the giant hand with a finger and the worst best wishes.
[00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:46.560]   Ellen Baum's mother was an artist who helped us get the hand shading right.
[00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:48.480]   His mom helped you.
[00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:52.760]   His parents were so great at Kim's doing jokes was funny to them and I love that.
[00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:53.760]   Oh, that's hysterical.
[00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:55.280]   Now, did it actually happen?
[00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:56.280]   Did it work?
[00:47:56.280 --> 00:47:59.960]   No, Steve Jobs told some other seniors that we're trying to do a prank to like fill up
[00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:01.760]   the student vlog with water or something.
[00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:05.480]   He told them where our little fishing line, 40 pound fishing line ran.
[00:48:05.480 --> 00:48:07.520]   And the next morning it had been cut.
[00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:10.400]   We could tell it had been cut and not strained and stretched.
[00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:13.240]   And I talked to one of the kids the next year and they said, "Yes, Steve told us where
[00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:14.280]   it was so we cut it."
[00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:19.480]   And now we've learned finally the root of Steve Jobs' paranoia and secrecy.
[00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:21.520]   It all goes back to 1972.
[00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:22.520]   Maybe.
[00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:23.520]   It could be.
[00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:26.520]   Well, he talked like he didn't tell anyone.
[00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:28.520]   When I asked him, "Did you tell them?"
[00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:30.320]   No, I didn't, but he did.
[00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:32.200]   Now, you said there were two pranks.
[00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:33.680]   Does anybody know about this other one?
[00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:35.360]   A few people must know about it.
[00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:40.880]   We met a phone freak up at Berkeley who was also said he could pick locks named Groucho.
[00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:43.680]   That was his call name back then.
[00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:45.880]   So we said, "Oh, come down to the high school.
[00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:48.120]   Steve knew how the sprinkler system worked at the high school.
[00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:50.120]   He could pick his way into the shed.
[00:48:50.120 --> 00:48:54.960]   We would open up the switches, attach the fishing line to the switches and turn the sprinklers
[00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:59.640]   on the parents on the football field while the students are watching in the stands during
[00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:00.640]   graduation.
[00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:04.480]   And then we went to, my idea was a poxie of shut so the janitor came over and turned
[00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:05.480]   off.
[00:49:05.480 --> 00:49:07.000]   Oh, no.
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:08.000]   What happened?
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:09.000]   He picked it.
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:10.000]   He picked it.
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:12.480]   He picked it midnight and 2 a.m. and couldn't get into the building.
[00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:16.400]   So I climbed up on top and moved something on top and there was a hole down in the building,
[00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:18.440]   but it was the wrong half of the building.
[00:49:18.440 --> 00:49:20.440]   So it didn't come off.
[00:49:20.440 --> 00:49:23.080]   Well, maybe a good thing.
[00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:27.320]   We might have ended up your years in juvenile detention center instead of designing the
[00:49:27.320 --> 00:49:28.320]   Apple One computer.
[00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:31.520]   But it has something very much in common with designing the Apple computer.
[00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:35.800]   So I went out doing something you're inspired to do and feel and you have all this passion
[00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:38.360]   for and doing it at 2, 3 in the morning.
[00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:40.440]   That's what hacking is all about, isn't it, really?
[00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:44.120]   I mean, hacking in a good sense, not in a negative sense, but in the...
[00:49:44.120 --> 00:49:49.360]   I mean, everything I could, everything I could to get any computer time, I had my first class
[00:49:49.360 --> 00:49:50.360]   in it.
[00:49:50.360 --> 00:49:53.840]   It was a grad class at University of Colorado, but I ran across five times over a budget
[00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:56.320]   and they made it sound like they were going to charge me.
[00:49:56.320 --> 00:49:59.120]   And so I didn't go back to that school, but the next year I had a friend who had a key
[00:49:59.120 --> 00:50:03.760]   to the de-unto computer room and we'd go in at midnight and start up all the machinery
[00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:07.440]   and I'd run punch-cart programs through and work all night on listings.
[00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:11.520]   It's just like, you know, you find a way to get access to a computer and that's all
[00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:12.920]   you want to do in life.
[00:50:12.920 --> 00:50:18.640]   What was it that made this so fascinating to you?
[00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:23.280]   Why is it that people are so interested in getting a personal computer?
[00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:24.520]   We now take it for granted.
[00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:25.520]   Everybody's got one.
[00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:28.760]   We've got one on our phone and our pocket, our PDAs, our MP3 players.
[00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:31.560]   What was it about those days that you had to have one?
[00:50:31.560 --> 00:50:35.480]   Well, because you could do things with it, because you wanted to do things with it, because
[00:50:35.480 --> 00:50:37.600]   they empowered you to do things.
[00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:38.600]   What kind of things?
[00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:41.480]   You know, for us as hobbyists, there were two aspects of it.
[00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:46.480]   One, we were the technology and being able to get these things to work and do anything
[00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:49.360]   interesting was just really cool.
[00:50:49.360 --> 00:50:53.720]   And secondly, being able to do something as interesting as a computer where you could
[00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:59.280]   make it do something interesting like draw graphics or do calculations or plan out your
[00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:04.200]   calendar or whatever it is that you wanted to do, you now had a servant who could do
[00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:08.840]   it for you if you could figure out how to construct it and tell it what to do.
[00:51:08.840 --> 00:51:10.560]   Why do people do build robots?
[00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:16.120]   I just saw something on PBS last night about the DARPA grand challenge about teams competing
[00:51:16.120 --> 00:51:21.160]   to build cars that would drive a 100 mile course by themselves.
[00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:22.160]   Why do people do that?
[00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:25.760]   Because it's cool.
[00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:27.520]   I worked my tail off for six months.
[00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:33.120]   I built this thing and it ran a complicated course of 100 miles and it did it by itself
[00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:34.640]   and it solved all the problems.
[00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:38.840]   It got the desert, it got the mountains, it got the greenery, it got the red stuff, it
[00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:41.760]   got the obstacles, the person in the middle of the road.
[00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:43.120]   Look, it did everything.
[00:51:43.120 --> 00:51:44.600]   It solved every problem.
[00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:45.600]   That's awesome.
[00:51:45.600 --> 00:51:47.760]   Let me point out something about Bill's passion.
[00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:51.480]   He also had to make a big decision to leave Hewlett-Packard to join Apple.
[00:51:51.480 --> 00:51:55.080]   He mentioned that he left before you did.
[00:51:55.080 --> 00:52:01.280]   No, actually he was our third employee but he got batch number four because he had to
[00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:07.120]   stick some time out at HP to a certain date and my new blood came in officially for yes,
[00:52:07.120 --> 00:52:08.120]   three.
[00:52:08.120 --> 00:52:10.800]   I think I left Hewlett-Packard to go work in the garage.
[00:52:10.800 --> 00:52:13.200]   I knew we were still working to go Packard.
[00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:15.560]   No, don't fight over it.
[00:52:15.560 --> 00:52:17.400]   It's okay, it doesn't matter anymore anyway.
[00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:19.360]   Hold on, it's possible because I kind of hung.
[00:52:19.360 --> 00:52:25.000]   No, the day that I decided we would start the real Apple II company, I told my boss and
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:26.480]   left Hewlett-Packard that day.
[00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:29.320]   He stayed there a long time.
[00:52:29.320 --> 00:52:32.520]   So Waz is badge one, Bill is badge four.
[00:52:32.520 --> 00:52:34.680]   Who's badge two?
[00:52:34.680 --> 00:52:36.240]   Steve, believe.
[00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:40.920]   Because in the history book sometimes they say that when Steve found out that Waz was
[00:52:40.920 --> 00:52:43.120]   badge one, he asked for badge zero.
[00:52:43.120 --> 00:52:44.120]   Not so.
[00:52:44.120 --> 00:52:46.320]   I don't know for a fact one way or the other.
[00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:50.280]   I doubt that Mike Scott would have relented he couldn't have passed zero because Mike
[00:52:50.280 --> 00:52:52.320]   Scott was kind of that way.
[00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:54.680]   There is no badge zero.
[00:52:54.680 --> 00:52:58.880]   You know, on the subject of anniversaries in history, I went to the talk at the Computer
[00:52:58.880 --> 00:53:00.400]   History Museum last month.
[00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:06.040]   It was the 50th anniversary of the founding of Shockley Semiconductor, which was February
[00:53:06.040 --> 00:53:09.120]   of '56, I guess.
[00:53:09.120 --> 00:53:11.880]   So that's considered the birth of Silicon Valley.
[00:53:11.880 --> 00:53:12.880]   Mm-hmm.
[00:53:12.880 --> 00:53:17.800]   Well, you could go back to the '30s and Hewlett-Packard, really.
[00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:19.360]   It's hard to put one number on it.
[00:53:19.360 --> 00:53:24.000]   But no matter what number you pick, it's relatively recent history.
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:28.520]   When I started out in high school and got interested in electronics, I left it after
[00:53:28.520 --> 00:53:30.000]   a good slide rule.
[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:31.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:33.920]   One of those nice bamboo models, right?
[00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:34.920]   Right.
[00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:39.120]   And actually carried a six-inch plastic slide rule in my pocket protector through high
[00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:40.120]   school.
[00:53:40.120 --> 00:53:43.440]   And then during that time, the four-function calculators came out.
[00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:45.800]   But they were hugely expensive, of course.
[00:53:45.800 --> 00:53:46.800]   They weren't affordable.
[00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:47.800]   And then also, that's right.
[00:53:47.800 --> 00:53:52.920]   And then also during that time, the Hewlett-Packard 35 calculator, the first real scientific calculator
[00:53:52.920 --> 00:53:53.920]   came out.
[00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:54.920]   Mm-hmm.
[00:53:54.920 --> 00:53:57.480]   Yeah, that was an object worthy of lust.
[00:53:57.480 --> 00:53:58.480]   All right.
[00:53:58.480 --> 00:53:59.480]   OK.
[00:53:59.480 --> 00:54:08.280]   So I've run from slide rules to a dual 2 gigahertz G5 Mac running OS X and a 20-inch color screen
[00:54:08.280 --> 00:54:14.600]   with millions of colors being able to do 3D rendering and all sorts of amazing stuff,
[00:54:14.600 --> 00:54:15.600]   you know, just in this lifetime.
[00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:17.360]   And I've got many more years to live.
[00:54:17.360 --> 00:54:18.360]   That's really remarkable.
[00:54:18.360 --> 00:54:19.760]   I figure I'm going to see a lot more changes.
[00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:20.760]   It's very exciting.
[00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:24.840]   So I've gone from time seeing someone who came to talk at Apple and said, "I spent the
[00:54:24.840 --> 00:54:31.080]   last 10 years trying to get lines drawn on CRTs and taking frames of them with a movie
[00:54:31.080 --> 00:54:33.880]   camera to make animations."
[00:54:33.880 --> 00:54:40.680]   And the time when any kid can buy an animation package and, well, you don't, they're using
[00:54:40.680 --> 00:54:48.520]   Halo to make a comedy series of episodes called Red versus Blue.
[00:54:48.520 --> 00:54:49.520]   Red versus Blue, yeah.
[00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:50.520]   Right?
[00:54:50.520 --> 00:54:55.040]   Where they use Halo as a 3D environment generator so they can do their skits.
[00:54:55.040 --> 00:54:56.680]   This is amazing.
[00:54:56.680 --> 00:54:58.400]   You don't have to be a technologist.
[00:54:58.400 --> 00:54:59.720]   You don't have to be a genius.
[00:54:59.720 --> 00:55:04.040]   You don't have to be much of anything except for a creative person.
[00:55:04.040 --> 00:55:05.280]   And they're amazing tools.
[00:55:05.280 --> 00:55:07.240]   In a way, that is the maturity.
[00:55:07.240 --> 00:55:11.080]   And that is really what the big transition has been, is that you don't have to be a geek
[00:55:11.080 --> 00:55:12.240]   anymore.
[00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:16.160]   You could just be somebody with a creative mind and a desire to do it.
[00:55:16.160 --> 00:55:17.160]   Yes.
[00:55:17.160 --> 00:55:20.120]   And you asked, "Well, are we still going to see changes?"
[00:55:20.120 --> 00:55:21.120]   Well, yes.
[00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:22.120]   And I'll tell you why.
[00:55:22.120 --> 00:55:25.960]   Remember when Randy Wiggington said that, "Now with one line of code, I can do what
[00:55:25.960 --> 00:55:28.400]   it used to take me half a day to do?"
[00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:33.680]   Well, not only can he do it with one line of code, but thousands of other people around
[00:55:33.680 --> 00:55:36.080]   the world can do it with that same line of code.
[00:55:36.080 --> 00:55:39.600]   And they can do it with one line of code, something that they could not have done themselves
[00:55:39.600 --> 00:55:41.080]   if they had a month to do it.
[00:55:41.080 --> 00:55:42.080]   That's right.
[00:55:42.080 --> 00:55:45.920]   Because they didn't have the brilliance at the assembly language level that Randy Wiggington
[00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:46.920]   had.
[00:55:46.920 --> 00:55:47.920]   You're absolutely right.
[00:55:47.920 --> 00:55:54.040]   So you now have empowered thousands of people around the world to create new programs and
[00:55:54.040 --> 00:55:56.720]   new software because the tools are so much better.
[00:55:56.720 --> 00:55:59.320]   So of course you're going to get more people doing interesting things.
[00:55:59.320 --> 00:56:03.400]   But while the jobs were interested in making a computer that people could actually use,
[00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:07.120]   while it's from the standpoint of things like, "I want you to have a keyboard and a
[00:56:07.120 --> 00:56:11.320]   CRT display rather than lights and switches," and jobs from the standpoint of, "I want a
[00:56:11.320 --> 00:56:15.560]   case that looks like an office typewriter."
[00:56:15.560 --> 00:56:19.520]   And so that's the point where they were similar and on the same page rather than different,
[00:56:19.520 --> 00:56:23.120]   like the technologist or businessman dichotomy you often hear.
[00:56:23.120 --> 00:56:24.120]   Yeah.
[00:56:24.120 --> 00:56:26.320]   There really was a dichotomy so much in the early days.
[00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:30.360]   Maybe they took different halves of the job, but I think you're exactly right.
[00:56:30.360 --> 00:56:33.520]   They both were creating something as a unit.
[00:56:33.520 --> 00:56:35.280]   To me it's more like Lenin and McCartney.
[00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:38.320]   It's two halves of one like mine.
[00:56:38.320 --> 00:56:39.320]   Not at all.
[00:56:39.320 --> 00:56:41.040]   I did every bit.
[00:56:41.040 --> 00:56:45.000]   I never saw him doing any technology, none of the design.
[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:46.240]   But it could work software.
[00:56:46.240 --> 00:56:50.240]   So it takes somebody sitting down with ideas, playing with them, seeing what you can and
[00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:52.240]   can't do and coming up with new enhancements.
[00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:56.920]   And wow, what if I connected this this way and you have to have chips in your head to
[00:56:56.920 --> 00:57:00.560]   come up with ways to even develop color out of them?
[00:57:00.560 --> 00:57:03.880]   Had jobs not been there though?
[00:57:03.880 --> 00:57:05.680]   Would any of this have happened?
[00:57:05.680 --> 00:57:06.920]   Oh no, no, no.
[00:57:06.920 --> 00:57:09.840]   I think the business part is probably the more significant aspect.
[00:57:09.840 --> 00:57:14.680]   I mean, someone will do the equivalent technology eventually anyway.
[00:57:14.680 --> 00:57:19.120]   It'll happen all on one chip a couple years later and be cheap enough for a lot of those
[00:57:19.120 --> 00:57:20.480]   things would happen anyway.
[00:57:20.480 --> 00:57:22.520]   It's getting it to market is also important.
[00:57:22.520 --> 00:57:31.560]   But I don't sell yourself short because what I think is the two of you needed both of you.
[00:57:31.560 --> 00:57:37.480]   Yes, Steve had to have the vision for how computers could be used and fit into people.
[00:57:37.480 --> 00:57:42.520]   But he didn't really sit down and we could use this chip and get this in a computer or
[00:57:42.520 --> 00:57:46.000]   have the ideas of what you could build at an affordable price.
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:51.040]   Of course, in those days, the way the hierarchy was is you were judged by your technical prowess
[00:57:51.040 --> 00:57:53.040]   and nothing else, right?
[00:57:53.040 --> 00:57:54.800]   Oh, I have no idea.
[00:57:54.800 --> 00:57:56.360]   That's just me alone.
[00:57:56.360 --> 00:57:57.760]   That's all that matters to me.
[00:57:57.760 --> 00:58:00.720]   I think for a lot of other people.
[00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:01.720]   Randy, you...
[00:58:01.720 --> 00:58:05.040]   I was just trying to talk to anyone unless they noticed something good I designed and
[00:58:05.040 --> 00:58:06.440]   then I could talk to them.
[00:58:06.440 --> 00:58:11.000]   When IBM came along with the personal computer, how did you guys feel about that?
[00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:14.080]   Did it seem like it validated your dream?
[00:58:14.080 --> 00:58:17.120]   Or it wasn't such a good thing?
[00:58:17.120 --> 00:58:24.080]   No, actually, there's poetic justice on that, which is that the day that Apple ran the ad,
[00:58:24.080 --> 00:58:27.320]   you know, welcome IBM seriously.
[00:58:27.320 --> 00:58:30.160]   The ultimate act of arrogance by Apple.
[00:58:30.160 --> 00:58:32.080]   A full page ad, by the way.
[00:58:32.080 --> 00:58:33.880]   Full page ad.
[00:58:33.880 --> 00:58:38.800]   I remember we were in Seattle meeting with Microsoft.
[00:58:38.800 --> 00:58:45.320]   So we were totally sleeping with the enemy and had no idea that Microsoft was eventually
[00:58:45.320 --> 00:58:49.200]   going to come and be much larger than Apple.
[00:58:49.200 --> 00:58:52.640]   What was that conversation about with Microsoft?
[00:58:52.640 --> 00:58:55.680]   Oh, they had to do a multi-plan.
[00:58:55.680 --> 00:58:57.720]   They had to do a spreadsheet.
[00:58:57.720 --> 00:58:58.720]   That's right.
[00:58:58.720 --> 00:58:59.720]   Multi-plan.
[00:58:59.720 --> 00:59:00.720]   They did the first spreadsheet.
[00:59:00.720 --> 00:59:03.360]   It was truly terrible.
[00:59:03.360 --> 00:59:08.760]   But they had their own set of tools and so everything had to work with their tools.
[00:59:08.760 --> 00:59:10.440]   They had some really smart people on it.
[00:59:10.440 --> 00:59:13.040]   But you look back at those days.
[00:59:13.040 --> 00:59:18.680]   It was equivalent to using Flint Axes on this stuff.
[00:59:18.680 --> 00:59:21.800]   Everything was so primitive.
[00:59:21.800 --> 00:59:28.600]   Gates was actively saying, "Oh, this is a huge thing, but you guys are still our favorite
[00:59:28.600 --> 00:59:29.600]   customers."
[00:59:29.600 --> 00:59:32.320]   Yeah, yadda yadda yadda.
[00:59:32.320 --> 00:59:37.520]   By the way, in those days, Apple was very huge fast and was much larger than Microsoft.
[00:59:37.520 --> 00:59:40.520]   But that's because we built hardware.
[00:59:40.520 --> 00:59:45.840]   When you build the hardware, the last guy, you put 90% of your money into the hardware
[00:59:45.840 --> 00:59:49.880]   supplies, the parts you buy, assemble them in a factory, and then sell them.
[00:59:49.880 --> 00:59:55.720]   So you're basically nine or ten times larger than you would have been with just the software.
[00:59:55.720 --> 00:59:59.360]   Although in retrospect, it's a good positioning on the Fortune 500.
[00:59:59.360 --> 01:00:02.960]   Yeah, in retrospect, it might have been better to go with software from the beginning.
[01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:07.800]   Absolutely, but to be honest, in those days, Bill Gates was light years ahead of the rest
[01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:08.800]   of us.
[01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:12.960]   The rest of us didn't really see how you could make a business out of software, because
[01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:16.600]   especially software was always stolen.
[01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:22.040]   Even in those days, Bill Gates was invading against piracy and people were stealing his
[01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:23.040]   basic.
[01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:28.240]   Oh, yeah, remember that letter that he sent to the Homebrew Computer Club was?
[01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:33.360]   I didn't pay attention to it then, but I'll tell you, his basic just influenced me.
[01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:36.160]   Having never programmed in BASIC, never thought I would want a BASIC.
[01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:39.720]   I decided that was the right language for the startup computer days.
[01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:42.480]   So I went and learned BASIC just to write us a language.
[01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:44.520]   Did you write the first AppleSoft basic?
[01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:46.000]   No, the first Apple BASIC.
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:47.000]   It wasn't AppleSoft.
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:48.000]   Microsoft came along.
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:52.320]   We were moving to Haiti and we were actually working on trying to define a really cool floating
[01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:56.800]   point BASIC, and it was going to take us a while to write maybe half a year or more.
[01:00:56.800 --> 01:00:58.400]   Microsoft came up and said, "Hey, we have one.
[01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:01.760]   I don't know where it came from, but they had one for the 6502 and that saved us the
[01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:04.280]   effort so we could move on to other things."
[01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:05.280]   Right.
[01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:10.080]   Yeah, we just added some extensions to handle some of the graphic capabilities, and that
[01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:11.920]   was AppleSoft.
[01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:15.080]   In 1981, IBM comes in.
[01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:19.760]   You guys are now in a competitive business.
[01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:21.920]   By then, had Apple changed significantly?
[01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:24.000]   Oh, absolutely.
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:27.160]   We were now being run by the suits, as we called them.
[01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:34.120]   All of the MBAs and the Tom Whitney's that had come in and wanted to impose a corporate
[01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:38.920]   structure on Apple, and it was just a very poor fit.
[01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:45.560]   81 also is when Skydee was fired and Markle took over.
[01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:50.280]   Let's point out that Mike Scott was our CEO or President of Apple from the day we started
[01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:51.800]   to the day we went public.
[01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:54.400]   Yeah, he didn't run things like the suits and ties.
[01:01:54.400 --> 01:02:00.280]   Randy just, he went around and just saw who was inspired about doing what projects encouraged
[01:02:00.280 --> 01:02:04.240]   them and talked about what they were doing and got them motivated to do even more.
[01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:06.200]   What was Steve Jobs doing in those years?
[01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:07.200]   What was his role?
[01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:09.360]   Mike Markle has sat down when we all started.
[01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:12.360]   The three of us were together and said that, "Well, my role was obvious.
[01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:16.760]   I'd done all the hard one software in the engineering, and he was going to leave his
[01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:18.760]   retirement and do the marketing."
[01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:22.600]   And Steve's job would be well to basically float around to all the departments and learn
[01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:25.480]   to be an executive in every way at the company.
[01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:27.520]   And that's exactly what he did.
[01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:31.000]   And anything that was left over that needed doing, he'd do it.
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:34.800]   Like Randy said, even getting parts, getting on the phone and talking to someplace in New
[01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:36.440]   Jersey to get us some parts we needed.
[01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:42.120]   Steve was kicked off of the Lisa project for meddling with it in, I guess, late '80s,
[01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:44.600]   and that's when he really took an interest in the Mac project.
[01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:49.440]   So starting in late, like December of 1980, Steve was really involved building the Mac
[01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:51.600]   team.
[01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:57.800]   And then I remember in probably the fall of '81, when we first got the first IBM PC,
[01:02:57.800 --> 01:02:59.080]   we over at the Mac group.
[01:02:59.080 --> 01:03:06.960]   We took it apart, me and Burl and Andy, probably, and Brian Howard, and dissected it and came
[01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:11.000]   to the conclusion that it was actually quite comparable to the Apple III.
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:15.280]   I mean, the Apple III looked very favorable by comparison.
[01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:16.600]   For all, it's false, I guess.
[01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:19.920]   But technically, they were quite comparable.
[01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:24.360]   And so did at that time, did people say, "Well, this is no threat IBM's just another
[01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:25.880]   follow-on product?"
[01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:32.960]   Yeah, well, of course, we were much more interested in enthusiastic about the Macintosh design
[01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:34.880]   that we ate already prototypes.
[01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:35.880]   Even then, yeah.
[01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:45.640]   We laughed about how clunky the IBM PC was mechanically compared to, say, the Apple III,
[01:03:45.640 --> 01:03:49.280]   which was much more designed and much more integrated.
[01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:51.160]   In terms of what it could do, they were comparable.
[01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:56.080]   But in terms of how much elegance went into the design, it was just like a bunch of bolt-on
[01:03:56.080 --> 01:03:58.240]   parts in cheap metal.
[01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:01.640]   Apple, of course, is still known for design and for elegance.
[01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:03.480]   Was that always a part of the company?
[01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:05.760]   Yeah, very early on.
[01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:11.040]   Even starting with the engineering elegance of the WaaS disk drive.
[01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:17.760]   Well, Steve, Steve, really liked things to be elegant and beautiful.
[01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:21.280]   And actually, that's one of the reasons he liked my designs over, say, find another
[01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:22.280]   engineer.
[01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:23.280]   Right.
[01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:24.280]   Yes.
[01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:28.560]   It was sort of an artistic quality that you can't really describe or pay for, but he likes
[01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:31.400]   those things to be done well and right.
[01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:38.560]   I remember back in the job's house seeing architectural style renderings or graphical
[01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:42.040]   renderings of cases that Ron Wayne had designed.
[01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:46.520]   And they all looked head and shoulders better than what anything else was doing out there.
[01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:50.880]   Like processor technology saw, which had these nice wood side panels and so forth.
[01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:53.160]   These designs were better and they weren't good enough for jobs.
[01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:58.800]   So he went off and found Jerry Manock from Manock Comprehensive Design, who did the plastic
[01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:00.320]   case design for the Apple II.
[01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:02.760]   And finally, he had something that looked the way he wanted.
[01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:09.360]   So even from those very early days, having a designed look and feel was just as important
[01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:13.080]   as having the design technology inside.
[01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:14.080]   Interesting.
[01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:15.080]   Yeah.
[01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:21.120]   Going with a switching power supply, which was small and cool, rather than the big, giant,
[01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:24.920]   hot behemoth power supplies that were conventional in those days.
[01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:27.720]   That was another thing in that direction.
[01:05:27.720 --> 01:05:32.800]   We want things to be lean and sleek and elegant and the best.
[01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:37.200]   And it's also avoided having to have a fan.
[01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:38.920]   Even then, you didn't want a fan.
[01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:40.240]   The first computer.
[01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:42.280]   So some of these things kind of stick on.
[01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:45.880]   Once you've done it once, you put a value on it and forever try to save that fan.
[01:05:45.880 --> 01:05:48.200]   Yeah, it's interesting, isn't it?
[01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:50.360]   The seeds of the future are already present.
[01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:54.520]   Well, but it's more what Bill was saying, trying to get something a little super and
[01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:57.520]   sleeker than the others out there.
[01:05:57.520 --> 01:05:59.960]   Of course, you've got to do it at an affordable price.
[01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:02.120]   Were you guys science fiction readers?
[01:06:02.120 --> 01:06:04.760]   Were you influenced by science fiction at all?
[01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:07.840]   Was that part of it too?
[01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:10.640]   Of course, but I don't know if that's part of it.
[01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:17.520]   I think where you started out was in your early years, six to 10 to 12 years old, sort
[01:06:17.520 --> 01:06:20.040]   of movies you like to watch, even through high school.
[01:06:20.040 --> 01:06:21.040]   It seems your direction.
[01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:25.840]   So first, we all have all the thoughts that people have that background.
[01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:30.360]   Yeah, I would say that a lot of tech people tend to gravitate towards, say, science and
[01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:33.560]   fantasy or oriented entertainment.
[01:06:33.560 --> 01:06:38.720]   But I wasn't involved in electronics because I had seen robots and science fiction.
[01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:42.800]   It was because I got drawn to building things that worked.
[01:06:42.800 --> 01:06:47.480]   And I wanted to do it with electronics rather than, say, with mechanical parts on a lathe
[01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:48.800]   and a milling machine.
[01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:53.520]   I love doing things with transistors and resistors and capacitors and making those things work.
[01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:54.520]   And I wanted to build things.
[01:06:54.520 --> 01:06:55.760]   And that's a good point.
[01:06:55.760 --> 01:06:56.960]   It applies to me.
[01:06:56.960 --> 01:07:01.720]   And most technical people are practical type people, not theorists that would like the
[01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:04.760]   science fiction and maybe they could do this and want to be dreamers.
[01:07:04.760 --> 01:07:09.840]   I think really the science fiction is an accidental byproduct of the fact that they love things
[01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:12.040]   that are complicated technically.
[01:07:12.040 --> 01:07:16.360]   The stories of science fiction are complicated technically as to what makes something work
[01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:19.480]   or happens in a certain strange way.
[01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:27.440]   And yet I have to think that the vision of what could be the kind of imagining of how
[01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:29.680]   technology could grow.
[01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:34.040]   I mean, that's part of science fiction too and that must have been some of it too, yes?
[01:07:34.040 --> 01:07:38.080]   Well, there are analogies between science fiction as people thinking of things that
[01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:39.080]   don't already exist.
[01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:40.080]   Right.
[01:07:40.080 --> 01:07:43.320]   And the engineers are always thinking of things that don't already exist.
[01:07:43.320 --> 01:07:46.320]   The difference is the science fiction people, they write stories.
[01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:49.120]   The things that others read and the engineers try to actually make it.
[01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:50.120]   Right.
[01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:51.120]   Right.
[01:07:51.120 --> 01:07:52.800]   And I'm with Bill on this one.
[01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:57.120]   Earlier, Steve had been talking about all the effort he put into designing with creative
[01:07:57.120 --> 01:07:59.040]   and cutting edge stuff.
[01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:03.200]   And going back to the time that he and I built the computer in my garage, that was the time
[01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:06.320]   that he taught me never to take anything of face value.
[01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:09.400]   Always look at what things could do, not what their names were.
[01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:13.480]   If you had a flip-flop and you needed an inverter, you could make it invert.
[01:08:13.480 --> 01:08:17.720]   If you had a NAMB gate and you needed a pulse generator, you could make it a pulse generator.
[01:08:17.720 --> 01:08:22.080]   You didn't have to add another chip with the name inverter or pulse generator to get
[01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:25.520]   the thing you wanted if you just thought creatively about what you already had.
[01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:27.400]   And that really grants you on my engineering thinking.
[01:08:27.400 --> 01:08:31.920]   Bill, I have to thank you because I try to put that concept into words over and over
[01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:33.720]   and I can never do it as well as you just did.
[01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:34.720]   Well, thank you.
[01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:35.720]   You're welcome.
[01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:38.600]   And thank you very much because you really changed my way of thinking forever.
[01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:46.360]   Well, it's also the power of constraints, even in poetry or the arts, having some constraints
[01:08:46.360 --> 01:08:51.520]   sometimes enhances creativity, not having all the money in the world or as many chips
[01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:56.760]   as maybe that's why HP couldn't do as good a job as you guys did because you didn't have
[01:08:56.760 --> 01:09:00.080]   all of the resources.
[01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:01.080]   You had to make it.
[01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:06.440]   It forces you to think about other different ways of doing things than the normal, yes.
[01:09:06.440 --> 01:09:07.440]   Right.
[01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:09.160]   I was trying to get it.
[01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:12.200]   Influence Steve's design a lot because he didn't want to spend a lot on the chips because
[01:09:12.200 --> 01:09:14.560]   remember he was doing this all out of his own pocket.
[01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:15.560]   Right.
[01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:16.560]   He didn't have a corporate bankroll.
[01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:17.560]   Right, exactly.
[01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:19.000]   I also was very lazy.
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:23.480]   And if I designed something with half as many chips, half as many wires I had to bother
[01:09:23.480 --> 01:09:25.840]   soldering.
[01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:33.200]   Annie has in some ways has been keeping the oral history alive with folklore.org.
[01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:34.720]   I actually want to ask all of you.
[01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:37.440]   I mean, there have been a number of histories written of Apple computer.
[01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:39.960]   I've heard Waz say that none of them were accurate.
[01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:43.760]   In fact, Waz says he's trying to live up to the picture that people paint of him instead
[01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:45.760]   of the truth.
[01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:51.440]   Are there anything, any just horrible blunders that you'd like to correct at this point?
[01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:55.120]   Only one I can think of is just that, as Waz pointed out earlier, is that a lot of people
[01:09:55.120 --> 01:09:58.120]   think that Mike Markle was CEO and that wasn't true.
[01:09:58.120 --> 01:10:02.960]   It was, you know, Mike Scott was CEO for many years and, you know, did a great job.
[01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:04.720]   Markle had put money in early on.
[01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:06.400]   Was that his role early on?
[01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:07.400]   Yes.
[01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:09.320]   Well, he was also the one that assembled the business.
[01:10:09.320 --> 01:10:12.080]   You know, as someone said earlier, he was the adult.
[01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:14.680]   And he knew how business ran and who you needed.
[01:10:14.680 --> 01:10:18.200]   He was the person who found Mike Scott because he said, "You need a real president.
[01:10:18.200 --> 01:10:19.200]   You can't do it, Jobs.
[01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:20.200]   You need a real president.
[01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:23.680]   So let's get Mike Scott because he knows how to do this stuff.
[01:10:23.680 --> 01:10:25.040]   And you need to incorporate.
[01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:26.480]   So this is how you do it.
[01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:27.480]   Right.
[01:10:27.480 --> 01:10:29.760]   And this, I can put in some money, but you need more.
[01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:32.560]   So this is how you go and you get money.
[01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:37.240]   Markle was CEO after Mike Scott and before John Scully for about a year.
[01:10:37.240 --> 01:10:38.800]   He hated it, I think.
[01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:39.960]   He did it.
[01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:42.880]   He aged about 20 years during that one year.
[01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:43.880]   Absolutely.
[01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:46.320]   Takes a certain kind of personality to do it, I guess.
[01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:49.240]   Andy, you came on, you said you were an Apple fan.
[01:10:49.240 --> 01:10:50.960]   You came on in 1979.
[01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:54.560]   What kind of company was it when you joined the Apple company?
[01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:57.960]   Oh, it was still exploding in terms of growing.
[01:10:57.960 --> 01:10:59.880]   It was growing incredibly fast.
[01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:01.680]   Everyone was really excited.
[01:11:01.680 --> 01:11:06.920]   The Apple II was, I came just before VisiCalc came on the market.
[01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:09.360]   I think I started in August '79.
[01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:13.680]   VisiCalc started really taking off just shortly afterwards.
[01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:17.920]   And so Apple's growth just took even another step way forward.
[01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:23.080]   So there was a certain euphoria, I think, because the Apple II had found the sweet spot
[01:11:23.080 --> 01:11:25.920]   and it was growing like crazy.
[01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:33.120]   At the same time, Apple was consciously trying to mature and instead of the homebrew roots
[01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:38.440]   that came from, started hiring all these engineers from Hewlett Packard, I remember
[01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:46.000]   Randy once called them mock Fidesdale engineers because they seemed more for a show than for
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:47.000]   their actual skills.
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.480]   And maybe they plotted a little bit too.
[01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:52.560]   Yeah, Apple was done with it.
[01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:57.120]   Yeah, well, it was very much a company in transition, I would say.
[01:11:57.120 --> 01:12:01.680]   Trying to grow up, putting all its resources into the Apple III and Lisa, which didn't
[01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:03.640]   end up being their future.
[01:12:03.640 --> 01:12:09.520]   But luckily, you know, Jeff Raskin had this small Mac team that did eventually create
[01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:11.560]   Apple's future.
[01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:16.480]   Tell me about the beginning of the Mac team.
[01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:20.320]   It wasn't a pirate organization right up front.
[01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:25.160]   Was it kind of the black box organization of skunk works or was it considered to be important
[01:12:25.160 --> 01:12:27.440]   for the company right from the beginning?
[01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:28.440]   No, it wasn't from the beginning.
[01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:30.400]   It was Jeff Raskins, baby.
[01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:35.040]   Jeff had a dream of an ultra simple, ultra low cost computer.
[01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:42.720]   He was head of pubs at Apple, but he also was a thinker and he started writing papers.
[01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:47.120]   The first one I remember was called Computers by the Millions that analyzed what it would
[01:12:47.120 --> 01:12:50.960]   take to sell computers by the millions.
[01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:55.760]   His answer was extreme simplicity along with extreme low cost.
[01:12:55.760 --> 01:13:03.240]   So he kept lobbying Tom Whitney and Mike Markla for some people to help him set up a little
[01:13:03.240 --> 01:13:04.240]   team.
[01:13:04.240 --> 01:13:09.200]   Finally, in the fall of 1979, they allowed him to do that.
[01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:13.760]   His first great find was Burrell Smith, who he recruited from the service department.
[01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:18.320]   Burrell did an incredible job at designing a little digital board for him and that's
[01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:20.840]   really what made the project take off.
[01:13:20.840 --> 01:13:24.600]   But you have to remember also that the Mac project was given to Raskins so that Raskin
[01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:29.280]   would get out of the hair of Tom Whitney and all those who were doing the important stuff,
[01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:31.720]   which was the Apple III and the Lisa.
[01:13:31.720 --> 01:13:35.720]   So it was really sort of like kicking him out to the side office.
[01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:38.240]   That's how it was internally done.
[01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:43.580]   If you look at the sort of people that Jeff staffed, Mac and Toss group with, it was
[01:13:43.580 --> 01:13:49.400]   the most incredible collection of kind of creative and humanistic people in the company.
[01:13:49.400 --> 01:13:53.000]   I mean, there was a bit of that in the, a lot of that in the Lisa group too, but it was
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:58.680]   a rare, strange blend of people, people like Andy Hertzfeld and Burrell Smith and Bill Atkinson
[01:13:58.680 --> 01:13:59.680]   and myself.
[01:13:59.680 --> 01:14:03.360]   All the people you had on the show, even though I'm the only one who wasn't involved
[01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:07.840]   in very early Apple, all of them were involved in the Mac and Toss project in its early stages.
[01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:09.520]   Yeah, I thought that's interesting.
[01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:11.560]   I wonder why that is.
[01:14:11.560 --> 01:14:17.460]   I think when Steve took it over, he hired back as many of the original crew as he could.
[01:14:17.460 --> 01:14:22.860]   Did he see this as a kind of almost a rebirth of the original Apple?
[01:14:22.860 --> 01:14:27.780]   There was some of that, like getting back to the roots, you know, finding the original
[01:14:27.780 --> 01:14:28.780]   spirit.
[01:14:28.780 --> 01:14:34.700]   Well, the Apple III and the Lisa were really intended to be business machines.
[01:14:34.700 --> 01:14:39.380]   And I remember in that at that time, everybody was a little disappointed that the home market
[01:14:39.380 --> 01:14:40.380]   hadn't taken off.
[01:14:40.380 --> 01:14:44.380]   Like the business market was the only personal computer market.
[01:14:44.380 --> 01:14:47.320]   Were you trying to recapture that home market?
[01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:51.780]   Yeah, well, we didn't really have to recapture it because all during the time the Macintosh
[01:14:51.780 --> 01:14:54.680]   was developing, the Apple II was doing just great.
[01:14:54.680 --> 01:14:59.960]   There was nothing really so much to recapture, but we also could see the future a little bit.
[01:14:59.960 --> 01:15:06.080]   And we knew we had to make things radically easier to use to really expand the market.
[01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:07.080]   Right.
[01:15:07.080 --> 01:15:12.640]   Also, a lot of it was motivated by jobs wanted to show that the Apple III and Lisa were not
[01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:13.880]   being run properly.
[01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:17.480]   You know, that he could do things better.
[01:15:17.480 --> 01:15:22.960]   Which seems to be also another light motif in the Jobs' story.
[01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:27.960]   Well, I think another aspect of the Macintosh was that the Apple II had been allowed to
[01:15:27.960 --> 01:15:31.360]   be basically the same kind of computer for so long.
[01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:33.640]   And there was so much more you could do with computers.
[01:15:33.640 --> 01:15:39.400]   And once we had seen what could be done with Xerox Park and with the Lisa and so forth,
[01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:45.480]   that you could really break out of the character-based display and uppercase characters and so forth.
[01:15:45.480 --> 01:15:48.680]   That there was much more you could do and much more people wanted to do with personal
[01:15:48.680 --> 01:15:49.680]   computers.
[01:15:49.680 --> 01:15:50.680]   Yeah.
[01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:54.040]   Keep on mind that it was Jeff Raskin that led us into Xerox Park.
[01:15:54.040 --> 01:15:55.040]   Oh, really?
[01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:56.040]   Yeah.
[01:15:56.040 --> 01:15:57.040]   So, yeah.
[01:15:57.040 --> 01:15:58.680]   His point is, his point is, he's the one that said you guys need to come over and see
[01:15:58.680 --> 01:16:00.920]   what is being done over here.
[01:16:00.920 --> 01:16:05.480]   And that's the famous story of Steve Jobs seeing the interface of the, I guess, the Alto or
[01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:08.960]   the Star and seeing Windows, menus, mouse.
[01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:09.960]   Interesting.
[01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:11.960]   A little more than that.
[01:16:11.960 --> 01:16:13.200]   How did we actually know?
[01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:14.200]   Tell me about the reaction.
[01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:19.480]   Although, it was pretty much, once we all saw it, we sort of knew this.
[01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:20.960]   Once you went this way, you'd never come back.
[01:16:20.960 --> 01:16:22.400]   This was the future.
[01:16:22.400 --> 01:16:29.320]   But Steve's real position was that Xerox didn't know how to mass produce it, make it low cost
[01:16:29.320 --> 01:16:30.320]   for the masses.
[01:16:30.320 --> 01:16:33.320]   And he was absolutely right.
[01:16:33.320 --> 01:16:37.240]   And that's why he was really smart to even start, technically hiring people like Andy
[01:16:37.240 --> 01:16:41.960]   and Burl, were people that could write very short, small code that took very little RAM,
[01:16:41.960 --> 01:16:46.880]   very little money for RAM and could design circuits like Burl didn't, extremely few
[01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:49.040]   chips the way I did.
[01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:51.040]   When did he run up the pirate flag?
[01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:53.200]   Well, Steve, that wasn't Steve.
[01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:57.000]   In a way, we did that to make fun of Steve Jobs.
[01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:03.680]   In January '83, Steve, we had these periodic retreats, like every six month, off sites.
[01:17:03.680 --> 01:17:07.720]   And Steve would begin them with slogans to set the tone for them.
[01:17:07.720 --> 01:17:14.080]   And one slogan he used, I believe, in January 1983 was, "It's better to be pirates than
[01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:16.160]   to join the Navy."
[01:17:16.160 --> 01:17:19.160]   And I can only speculate as to exactly what he meant by that.
[01:17:19.160 --> 01:17:24.320]   But I think it was something to do with the Mac team getting big, and at least some of
[01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:28.600]   the original people not feeling so good about that.
[01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:32.320]   But anyway, in a way, we were making fun of it.
[01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:37.040]   When Steve Cap said the idea, when we were moving into a new building, we moved from
[01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:42.280]   Bannley 4 across the street to Bannley 3, which seemed like an ordinary big, drab-apple
[01:17:42.280 --> 01:17:43.480]   building.
[01:17:43.480 --> 01:17:47.520]   And Steve Cap's was thinking of a way to, "How can we make it reflect our attitude a
[01:17:47.520 --> 01:17:48.720]   little more?"
[01:17:48.720 --> 01:17:50.600]   And he came up with the idea of the pirate flag.
[01:17:50.600 --> 01:17:56.000]   And we weren't sure what Steve Jobs would think of it, but when he saw it, he liked it.
[01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:57.880]   It stayed up there for a while.
[01:17:57.880 --> 01:18:03.200]   Did you feel like you were not a part of the main Apple crew at the time?
[01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:05.800]   In the very beginning, I think there was a feeling of that.
[01:18:05.800 --> 01:18:09.080]   We were often a little building by ourselves.
[01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:13.720]   And I would say, we liked that, because we were a little disenchanted with the main
[01:18:13.720 --> 01:18:18.640]   Apple crew at the time, the large Lisa and Apple 3 projects.
[01:18:18.640 --> 01:18:23.280]   But eventually, by the time the Mac shipped, I thought we were very much in the mainstream
[01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:24.280]   of Apple.
[01:18:24.280 --> 01:18:30.360]   The company had come around sometime in 1983, pinning a lot of hoops on the Mac.
[01:18:30.360 --> 01:18:33.200]   So by then, I think we were in the mainstream.
[01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:37.640]   Also, in 1983, the PC overtook the Apple II as a large selling computer in the world.
[01:18:37.640 --> 01:18:41.080]   I think that was a factor of us being more concerned about our future.
[01:18:41.080 --> 01:18:42.080]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:47.880]   By the time of the Macintosh introduction, Apple was in a little bit of a panic, because
[01:18:47.880 --> 01:18:53.720]   the IBM PC came in on incredibly strong in the fall of '83.
[01:18:53.720 --> 01:18:57.680]   And of course, Lisa and the Apple III both had stumbled.
[01:18:57.680 --> 01:19:00.000]   So everything was riding on this Macintosh?
[01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:03.360]   Now, Jeff Raskin kind of got chased out before then.
[01:19:03.360 --> 01:19:06.680]   Yeah, way before then.
[01:19:06.680 --> 01:19:14.680]   The day I started was, he was chased out officially the day before in February 1981.
[01:19:14.680 --> 01:19:17.800]   Steve Jobs, actually, what he had done was he had written a memo.
[01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:26.440]   About Steve Jobs that he sent to Mike Markle that was extremely scathing about Steve's
[01:19:26.440 --> 01:19:29.120]   inability as a manager.
[01:19:29.120 --> 01:19:34.600]   And I guess I never really got to the bottom of this, but someone gave that memo to Steve.
[01:19:34.600 --> 01:19:36.720]   I don't know who did it.
[01:19:36.720 --> 01:19:42.360]   When he saw that, he hit the roof, and he asked Jeff to take a little vacation.
[01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:45.760]   A paid three-month leave of absence.
[01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:46.760]   Was that a loss to the team?
[01:19:46.760 --> 01:19:49.520]   I mean, he had already set the tone of an easy to use computer.
[01:19:49.520 --> 01:19:52.160]   He named it Macintosh.
[01:19:52.160 --> 01:19:56.120]   Yeah, the original team more or less loved Jeff.
[01:19:56.120 --> 01:20:00.520]   And a lot of them, like Brian Howard, was his closest personal friend.
[01:20:00.520 --> 01:20:05.840]   But we also saw that for the good of the project, Jeff was against too much of it.
[01:20:05.840 --> 01:20:11.160]   And so all in all, it was sad, but it was a relief when he stepped away.
[01:20:11.160 --> 01:20:14.800]   It wasn't that we thought he would miss him at making the computer.
[01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:17.400]   It was more that we loved him as a person.
[01:20:17.400 --> 01:20:19.400]   Jeff was a great person.
[01:20:19.400 --> 01:20:24.280]   Unfortunately, it seems politics become a part of all of this as the company gets bigger,
[01:20:24.280 --> 01:20:29.240]   as pressures get greater and their strong personalities, of course, all along.
[01:20:29.240 --> 01:20:32.040]   Did they get in the way?
[01:20:32.040 --> 01:20:33.040]   Sure.
[01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:34.040]   Sure.
[01:20:34.040 --> 01:20:37.600]   People had very strong personalities, especially Steve Jobs.
[01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:41.080]   He could sometimes be just a terror on people.
[01:20:41.080 --> 01:20:44.760]   If he weren't self-confident, he could eat you alive.
[01:20:44.760 --> 01:20:49.280]   And there were a lot like a story I didn't put in my book, just because it was a little
[01:20:49.280 --> 01:20:52.960]   too sad was we had an engineer who would just cry at her desk.
[01:20:52.960 --> 01:20:56.000]   If Randy's still here, he'll remember Angeline Lowe.
[01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:57.000]   Oh, yes.
[01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:01.600]   But I didn't I'd walk by her desk at 5 p.m. in the evening and she'd just be sitting there
[01:21:01.600 --> 01:21:07.120]   sobbing because, you know, Steve had yelled at her or she just didn't feel up doing the
[01:21:07.120 --> 01:21:08.920]   work she was expected to.
[01:21:08.920 --> 01:21:15.160]   And so, you know, there's a human cost to all the pressure and stuff and, you know, definitely
[01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:17.760]   everyone's personality's weren't perfect.
[01:21:17.760 --> 01:21:23.520]   And it took a certain confidence to successfully work on the Mac team because of the mix of
[01:21:23.520 --> 01:21:24.520]   personalities.
[01:21:24.520 --> 01:21:28.400]   Yeah, if you had to hold up to Steve, you had to have to be pretty strong yourself because
[01:21:28.400 --> 01:21:32.360]   otherwise he would smell blood and just go for it.
[01:21:32.360 --> 01:21:34.800]   Was he always like that or did it get worse or?
[01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:41.440]   I think it got worse as by the time the Mac was around, he was pretty determined to show
[01:21:41.440 --> 01:21:46.840]   that he should be the next CEO that, you know, he had all the leadership abilities that he
[01:21:46.840 --> 01:21:49.840]   actually wouldn't develop for another, you know, 10 years.
[01:21:49.840 --> 01:21:53.000]   Yeah, I know, Woz, you're not a fan of politics.
[01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:54.840]   How did you stay above the fray?
[01:21:54.840 --> 01:21:56.560]   Well, I'm sort of out of it.
[01:21:56.560 --> 01:21:59.680]   I had their plane crash and so I could go back to college instead.
[01:21:59.680 --> 01:22:01.040]   So by then you were gone.
[01:22:01.040 --> 01:22:02.040]   Yes.
[01:22:02.040 --> 01:22:03.040]   Yeah.
[01:22:03.040 --> 01:22:06.480]   You want to talk a little bit about the plane crash?
[01:22:06.480 --> 01:22:07.480]   What was that?
[01:22:07.480 --> 01:22:08.480]   When was that?
[01:22:08.480 --> 01:22:09.480]   The crash taking off.
[01:22:09.480 --> 01:22:10.480]   I have no idea what happened.
[01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:13.400]   I have no memory for the next five weeks.
[01:22:13.400 --> 01:22:16.880]   I am kind of thankful for it.
[01:22:16.880 --> 01:22:19.920]   Because at that point you said I don't want to do this anymore.
[01:22:19.920 --> 01:22:25.320]   No, it's really after being out for five weeks, not even realizing I was out away from
[01:22:25.320 --> 01:22:28.440]   work, missing my dogs, had a lost tooth.
[01:22:28.440 --> 01:22:31.960]   I suddenly realized, well, my gosh, this is the last chance of my life.
[01:22:31.960 --> 01:22:36.200]   I could really manage to go back to college for one year to get my degree.
[01:22:36.200 --> 01:22:37.720]   And thankful for that.
[01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:38.720]   Do you miss it?
[01:22:38.720 --> 01:22:39.720]   Did you miss it?
[01:22:39.720 --> 01:22:40.720]   Oh, missed it a bit.
[01:22:40.720 --> 01:22:45.360]   Although I wasn't worried about the company critically needing me as a real critical element.
[01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:48.840]   There were enough engineers of high quality there and enough projects going on.
[01:22:48.840 --> 01:22:51.520]   It was well enough managed that the company was okay.
[01:22:51.520 --> 01:22:52.840]   That was the important thing.
[01:22:52.840 --> 01:22:58.520]   Bill and Andy and Randy, if you want to speak to this, how important was Woz?
[01:22:58.520 --> 01:23:02.240]   What was the role that he played even after he left?
[01:23:02.240 --> 01:23:04.320]   Was he a role model for you guys?
[01:23:04.320 --> 01:23:06.520]   What exactly role did he play?
[01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:08.280]   A spiritual leader.
[01:23:08.280 --> 01:23:12.680]   Woz was an incredible inspiration to the Mac he missed.
[01:23:12.680 --> 01:23:19.600]   I know especially to Burl, Burl learned electronics, not electronics, but he really learned to
[01:23:19.600 --> 01:23:23.720]   design computers by just looking at the Apple II design and he worshiped Woz.
[01:23:23.720 --> 01:23:28.720]   I did too.
[01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:36.240]   I worked with Woz before I even met him just based on that monitor.
[01:23:36.240 --> 01:23:38.720]   I think Woz set the standard.
[01:23:38.720 --> 01:23:44.520]   Everybody wanted to do far above average in whatever it was technically.
[01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:46.400]   You wanted your designs to be elegant.
[01:23:46.400 --> 01:23:48.280]   You wanted your things to be useful.
[01:23:48.280 --> 01:23:49.720]   You wanted everything to be wonderful.
[01:23:49.720 --> 01:23:55.040]   You wanted it to be something that people would appreciate and would make hearts, glad.
[01:23:55.040 --> 01:23:56.520]   All of those things.
[01:23:56.520 --> 01:24:00.480]   Even Steve Jobs always said great things about Woz's ability.
[01:24:00.480 --> 01:24:06.840]   We need more people like Woz, not people like the Lisa team where they're 100 engineers.
[01:24:06.840 --> 01:24:11.680]   I was going to say he used to use Woz as a threat even when Woz wasn't in a set Apple.
[01:24:11.680 --> 01:24:14.720]   If he didn't like your design enough, he goes, "I'll just call Woz.
[01:24:14.720 --> 01:24:19.040]   He'll do it in half."
[01:24:19.040 --> 01:24:24.440]   Did they ever try to pull you back into Apple, Steve?
[01:24:24.440 --> 01:24:25.920]   Did they respect your decision?
[01:24:25.920 --> 01:24:29.320]   No, I just went back in one day and worked for a while.
[01:24:29.320 --> 01:24:33.520]   I walked in after the US festivals and worked in the Apple II division where I felt like
[01:24:33.520 --> 01:24:35.440]   I'd been at the biggest contribution.
[01:24:35.440 --> 01:24:41.040]   That was around the time John Sculley joined and we were getting rid of the Apple III finally.
[01:24:41.040 --> 01:24:44.560]   There was nobody working on the Apple II in engineering since then.
[01:24:44.560 --> 01:24:48.120]   Was that around the time of the LC or?
[01:24:48.120 --> 01:24:49.120]   The Apple II GS.
[01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:50.120]   Yes, I mean.
[01:24:50.120 --> 01:24:53.120]   Yes, it was before that.
[01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:58.040]   And then of course there was the famous Apple II forever and the conference and everybody
[01:24:58.040 --> 01:25:03.120]   surrounded the Apple II and what a great design it was and then promptly moved on to Macintosh.
[01:25:03.120 --> 01:25:08.480]   Was that a sad day when the Mac replaced the Apple II?
[01:25:08.480 --> 01:25:09.480]   Not at all.
[01:25:09.480 --> 01:25:11.280]   It was actually a very gradual thing.
[01:25:11.280 --> 01:25:15.720]   It was a couple of years while the Apple II was still our bread and butter product.
[01:25:15.720 --> 01:25:20.840]   It wasn't really like, I mean I felt very awkward about these sayings like Apple II forever.
[01:25:20.840 --> 01:25:23.640]   I mean, good God, because we're moving on to other things.
[01:25:23.640 --> 01:25:24.640]   That's what you do.
[01:25:24.640 --> 01:25:25.640]   That's what you do.
[01:25:25.640 --> 01:25:26.640]   Yeah.
[01:25:26.640 --> 01:25:30.440]   Actually, one of the mistakes Apple made early on was not supporting the Apple II the way
[01:25:30.440 --> 01:25:31.440]   they should have.
[01:25:31.440 --> 01:25:37.000]   I mean, the fact is that if they had put money into the Apple II earlier, it would have lasted
[01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:38.000]   much longer.
[01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:41.440]   The time that you know, Woz and I were working on it, we thought it would only last like
[01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:42.440]   two years, three years.
[01:25:42.440 --> 01:25:45.480]   You know, I mean, that was sort of the lifespan of calculator back then.
[01:25:45.480 --> 01:25:46.480]   Right.
[01:25:46.480 --> 01:25:50.480]   Who would think that 10 years later, you know, anybody would have any interest in it other
[01:25:50.480 --> 01:25:51.480]   than historical?
[01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:56.000]   Well, six years ago I walked into my kid's kindergarten class and there were eight Apple
[01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:57.680]   IIs sitting on the desk there.
[01:25:57.680 --> 01:25:58.680]   Exactly.
[01:25:58.680 --> 01:25:59.680]   And that amazing.
[01:25:59.680 --> 01:26:05.320]   And there's still the fun thing is not only do they still work, but they, I don't think
[01:26:05.320 --> 01:26:07.880]   there was ever a bug in the hardware, the software that was found.
[01:26:07.880 --> 01:26:08.880]   Really?
[01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:09.880]   That's pretty remarkable.
[01:26:09.880 --> 01:26:10.880]   I don't think so.
[01:26:10.880 --> 01:26:13.720]   It's a different style of design and coding back then.
[01:26:13.720 --> 01:26:14.720]   Why?
[01:26:14.720 --> 01:26:15.720]   How was it different?
[01:26:15.720 --> 01:26:16.720]   Well, it did.
[01:26:16.720 --> 01:26:21.000]   You had to be, it was so intense that it was all in me, but had to be so aware of every
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:24.800]   little detail in my head walking around, not when I'm just looking at it on paper.
[01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:28.360]   And it wasn't everything just had to be perfect.
[01:26:28.360 --> 01:26:29.360]   You had to work perfect.
[01:26:29.360 --> 01:26:30.360]   It was like hardware.
[01:26:30.360 --> 01:26:33.240]   If hardware doesn't work, you can't go out and update it.
[01:26:33.240 --> 01:26:35.520]   These days everything can be updated.
[01:26:35.520 --> 01:26:38.320]   So that's a reason to certain flaws are allowed to slip through.
[01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:42.560]   You don't have to test thoroughly and you never have enough time to test everything
[01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:43.560]   these days.
[01:26:43.560 --> 01:26:45.360]   Well, it's much more complex than it was, of course.
[01:26:45.360 --> 01:26:47.720]   Yeah, in every possible environment.
[01:26:47.720 --> 01:26:48.720]   Yeah.
[01:26:48.720 --> 01:26:53.120]   But in a way it's still so genetically identical to the original.
[01:26:53.120 --> 01:26:56.800]   I mean, computers do pretty much the same thing they've always done.
[01:26:56.800 --> 01:26:57.800]   Yes, or no?
[01:26:57.800 --> 01:27:00.040]   Well, they do a lot more.
[01:27:00.040 --> 01:27:06.360]   I mean, I think I use my computer now for so much of my entertainment that I never did
[01:27:06.360 --> 01:27:08.960]   back in the days when the Mac first came out.
[01:27:08.960 --> 01:27:13.000]   And the networking really added such a strong dimension.
[01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:14.000]   Oh, God.
[01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:17.840]   I mean, I can't even mention on the Apple II doing a phone call on the Apple II.
[01:27:17.840 --> 01:27:21.960]   You know, the closest we ever got was having, you know, Draper make an automatic dialer
[01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:24.080]   out of it, generating all the calls.
[01:27:24.080 --> 01:27:25.080]   Yeah.
[01:27:25.080 --> 01:27:28.280]   Actually, actually by now, actually by now, computers would have gone this way.
[01:27:28.280 --> 01:27:31.640]   But what it points out is that when we came out with the Apple II and thought we were
[01:27:31.640 --> 01:27:35.760]   going to take over the world, we couldn't really see what those applications were going
[01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:37.360]   to be in the long term.
[01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:38.360]   Right.
[01:27:38.360 --> 01:27:40.440]   But that's the beauty of a general purpose device you don't need to.
[01:27:40.440 --> 01:27:41.440]   Exactly.
[01:27:41.440 --> 01:27:42.440]   That's right.
[01:27:42.440 --> 01:27:43.440]   Exactly right.
[01:27:43.440 --> 01:27:45.800]   If it can have a programming language, there's a million things you can do every day of your
[01:27:45.800 --> 01:27:46.800]   life forever.
[01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:48.240]   Well, I don't want to keep you guys forever.
[01:27:48.240 --> 01:27:51.560]   I could do this for a long time, but you've been very generous of your time.
[01:27:51.560 --> 01:27:54.360]   We've been talking for a couple of hours.
[01:27:54.360 --> 01:28:00.600]   I guess I'll give you a chance to put a coda on this build.
[01:28:00.600 --> 01:28:04.720]   You want to anything you'd like to add or say that we haven't said?
[01:28:04.720 --> 01:28:08.000]   No, I think we're code complete.
[01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:09.000]   Randy Wiggington.
[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:10.760]   In fee complete.
[01:28:10.760 --> 01:28:13.800]   No, it's just it's been so much fun.
[01:28:13.800 --> 01:28:17.200]   I can't believe it's been 30 years.
[01:28:17.200 --> 01:28:21.440]   It was so much fun and so exciting and still some of my best memories, you know, working
[01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:23.560]   on the Mac, working with Woz.
[01:28:23.560 --> 01:28:28.760]   Woz, I told earlier the story about the disk drive at CES when we go on Gamble for an hour
[01:28:28.760 --> 01:28:30.760]   than work for an hour.
[01:28:30.760 --> 01:28:31.760]   Thank you.
[01:28:31.760 --> 01:28:36.360]   You know, I mean, he said, by the way, was that he was 17 and you taught him to gamble.
[01:28:36.360 --> 01:28:38.160]   That's true, but he won money.
[01:28:38.160 --> 01:28:39.160]   I think he won 35-fucking.
[01:28:39.160 --> 01:28:44.160]   But I don't know if I told you that at the very end of this all-nighter, finally had
[01:28:44.160 --> 01:28:48.400]   everything working, I decided to copy one track, read this tracks, put in the other floppy
[01:28:48.400 --> 01:28:52.840]   write it, read, put in the first floppy, read it, the second floppy write it, all 36 tracks
[01:28:52.840 --> 01:28:54.720]   to 34 tracks I read and wrote.
[01:28:54.720 --> 01:28:58.920]   And when I was done, I was so tired I looked at them and I think I copied the bad one
[01:28:58.920 --> 01:29:01.040]   onto the good, which is the case.
[01:29:01.040 --> 01:29:02.040]   Oh.
[01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:03.040]   Yes.
[01:29:03.040 --> 01:29:04.960]   Well, it's good to know that even you can do something like that.
[01:29:04.960 --> 01:29:06.360]   I think we've all done something like that.
[01:29:06.360 --> 01:29:11.280]   Actually, what's more likely is that Woz would turn sadly to Randy after having done
[01:29:11.280 --> 01:29:15.200]   it perfectly and say, "Oh no, I copied the bad one onto the good one."
[01:29:15.200 --> 01:29:18.760]   And then you have this little gleam in his eye about Randy.
[01:29:18.760 --> 01:29:20.760]   That would sound more like Steve.
[01:29:20.760 --> 01:29:26.160]   I have got to say that my feeling about when you start a company and you're a small community,
[01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:29.400]   every little word you say, every bit of praise between you, everybody getting excited about
[01:29:29.400 --> 01:29:33.160]   your ideas, the whole team is so important.
[01:29:33.160 --> 01:29:36.560]   And boy, when you go back to that floppy disk, it never could have happened without
[01:29:36.560 --> 01:29:37.560]   Randy Wiggington.
[01:29:37.560 --> 01:29:38.560]   Yeah.
[01:29:38.560 --> 01:29:41.120]   This was just, I mean, there's no way in the world.
[01:29:41.120 --> 01:29:44.200]   If, I mean, he probably told you, I don't know if he told you about the two weeks where
[01:29:44.200 --> 01:29:48.600]   we worked every day getting ready to first see us just so we could go to Las Vegas.
[01:29:48.600 --> 01:29:49.600]   Well, it's...
[01:29:49.600 --> 01:29:50.840]   That was a fun time.
[01:29:50.840 --> 01:29:53.120]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:29:53.120 --> 01:29:57.200]   Maybe Andy Herzfeld would be the right person to kind of wrap this up since you, more than
[01:29:57.200 --> 01:30:03.200]   anybody, have been following this story and have helped, you know, tell it with your book
[01:30:03.200 --> 01:30:04.200]   and with folklore.org.
[01:30:04.200 --> 01:30:07.360]   Well, I can't wait to read Woz's book.
[01:30:07.360 --> 01:30:10.000]   I think that's going to be fantastic for me.
[01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:11.400]   Yeah, that's November.
[01:30:11.400 --> 01:30:12.400]   Yeah.
[01:30:12.400 --> 01:30:13.400]   And I was.
[01:30:13.400 --> 01:30:14.400]   I was.
[01:30:14.400 --> 01:30:15.400]   Yeah, yeah, that's great.
[01:30:15.400 --> 01:30:16.400]   I love that title.
[01:30:16.400 --> 01:30:17.400]   That's a great title.
[01:30:17.400 --> 01:30:18.400]   I'm looking forward to that.
[01:30:18.400 --> 01:30:21.320]   Yeah, I, you know, I just want to say happy birthday to Apple.
[01:30:21.320 --> 01:30:23.800]   Apple changed my life as well as changing the world.
[01:30:23.800 --> 01:30:28.380]   And I would, I feel incredibly privileged to work, to have worked with like Woz and Randy
[01:30:28.380 --> 01:30:35.640]   back, back in those days and to just to get to do what I did on the Mac was, was tremendous
[01:30:35.640 --> 01:30:38.600]   for me and Apple's been tremendous for the world.
[01:30:38.600 --> 01:30:42.280]   It's so great that on their 30th birthday, they're so much healthier than their 20th
[01:30:42.280 --> 01:30:43.280]   birthday.
[01:30:43.280 --> 01:30:44.280]   That's for sure.
[01:30:44.280 --> 01:30:50.280]   Apple feels like like a young company again with the infinite horizon in front of it.
[01:30:50.280 --> 01:30:51.280]   And I'm a big fan.
[01:30:51.280 --> 01:30:53.280]   I'll be buying the next side part of the day.
[01:30:53.280 --> 01:30:54.280]   It comes out.
[01:30:54.280 --> 01:30:55.280]   Yeah.
[01:30:55.280 --> 01:30:56.280]   As we all will know down.
[01:30:56.280 --> 01:30:59.080]   Few people get a chance to change the world.
[01:30:59.080 --> 01:31:03.440]   And I think that many of us on this phone, on this podcast have had the chance, several
[01:31:03.440 --> 01:31:05.280]   chances through Apple to change the world.
[01:31:05.280 --> 01:31:07.080]   It is a remarkable gift.
[01:31:07.080 --> 01:31:08.580]   You're right.
[01:31:08.580 --> 01:31:09.580]   Woz, any final thoughts?
[01:31:09.580 --> 01:31:14.200]   I just want to thank all the loyal, you know, the real passionate people.
[01:31:14.200 --> 01:31:16.440]   They really love computers for being computers.
[01:31:16.440 --> 01:31:21.240]   There's so much more in the Macintosh group than the PC group.
[01:31:21.240 --> 01:31:26.440]   And it's just need to be around because they all have this one commonality that, oh, their
[01:31:26.440 --> 01:31:29.280]   Macintosh is the most beautiful, wonderful thing they've ever had in their lives.
[01:31:29.280 --> 01:31:30.280]   And it means something to them.
[01:31:30.280 --> 01:31:31.760]   It's not just their work tool.
[01:31:31.760 --> 01:31:39.760]   You know, you think about in any endeavor to have a great hit is usually a one time thing.
[01:31:39.760 --> 01:31:43.600]   I mean, to have something like the Apple II and the success of the Apple II, it's rare
[01:31:43.600 --> 01:31:46.400]   that you see a follow on that is of equal success.
[01:31:46.400 --> 01:31:50.600]   And Apple's unique in that respect that not only did they follow the Apple II with the
[01:31:50.600 --> 01:31:53.840]   Macintosh, yeah, there were a few flops in between.
[01:31:53.840 --> 01:31:55.600]   And then now the Macintosh and the iPod.
[01:31:55.600 --> 01:32:01.680]   I mean, it's really been a remarkable company that has consistently created great products.
[01:32:01.680 --> 01:32:06.120]   Yeah, and at this point, you just got to tip your hat to Steve Jobs.
[01:32:06.120 --> 01:32:10.760]   I mean, he's the common thread for all those.
[01:32:10.760 --> 01:32:12.600]   It all starts with Steve and Steve.
[01:32:12.600 --> 01:32:13.600]   Thank you guys.
[01:32:13.600 --> 01:32:14.600]   Yep.
[01:32:14.600 --> 01:32:15.600]   Thanks a lot.
[01:32:15.600 --> 01:32:16.600]   Thank you.
[01:32:16.600 --> 01:32:17.600]   Happy birthday.
[01:32:17.600 --> 01:32:18.600]   Okay.
[01:32:18.600 --> 01:32:19.600]   All right.

[01:32:25.600 --> 01:32:26.600]   Bye.
[01:32:26.600 --> 01:32:27.600]   Bye.
[01:32:27.600 --> 01:32:28.600]   Thank you.

[01:32:40.600 --> 01:32:41.600]   Bye.
[01:32:41.600 --> 01:32:44.600]   This podcast is like the most appropriate thing on Apple's 30th birthday.
[01:32:44.600 --> 01:32:48.680]   Yeah, they can singularly appropriate, you know, to come and write this with a podcast rather
[01:32:48.680 --> 01:32:50.600]   than with a statue ad or something.
