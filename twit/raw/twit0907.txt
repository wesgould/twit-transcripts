[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.320]   can't you know I don't want everybody to come in on the holiday but I am thrilled
[00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.440]   that we have a great little panel for us. We've already done something fun for our
[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:36.560]   holiday at Twit. And I think Lisa suggested why don't you bring in the old men.
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:43.120]   We did the women last time. We'll do the old men. I got the all the old men are here.
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.600]   Doc Serals welcome. Good to see you. I think I'm probably the oldest. You might
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.800]   have a pride a place. I'm starting with you. Doc of course a host of Floss Weekly.
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:59.280]   A good friend forever. Doc.Surls.com. Good to see you, Doc.
[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.960]   Hey, good to see you. Welcome. It's great. He is yes, his bookshelf is color coordinated.
[00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.800]   Well, it's color guys. It's no longer my bookshelf. My books are on there but my
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:14.840]   kid who's 26 years old and his girlfriend rearranged them by color. That's a
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:21.480]   star. It's not a literary thing to do. But it's a decorative thing to do. So joining
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:27.920]   us from Manhattan where he has a beautiful wooded view out his window which is
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:34.160]   amazing and skunks. Right there. Yeah. Also from New Jersey. We're working our way east.
[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:46.080]   I wish. Jeff Jarvis, the host of this week at Google. And somehow associated with Craig
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:51.040]   Newmark. Thank you, Anthony. I wasn't going to read the whole damn thing. No, no, not for
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:56.240]   Twitch. Not for the grown up table. We missed you yesterday. We had a great twig. I was
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.840]   very sad. Yeah. You might have was great. I watched the first hour of a five hour show.
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:07.200]   Well, the good news is we got you today. So thrilled to have you here. I had to be
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.880]   gone because it's the end of the term. And so when I graduate, I'm going to move this over here.
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:17.760]   He is wearing, by the way, I should mention a sequin Santa hat. And over a good hand.
[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:23.840]   Wrong breast. My fester. Wrong breast. Thank you. That one. I always get a few.
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:30.320]   We've put it over your heart. He wanted festive colors, but the only festive color I have is
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:35.680]   gray. Yeah. Gray is a little brighter than black. You know, his festive today. Holy cow.
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:43.120]   Our great is he ever Steve Gibson from GXC.com. You ought to mean one. Mr. Steve. He is wearing his
[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.760]   entire Grinch outfit. Wow, Steve. Welcome. I don't know how I'm going to be taken seriously.
[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:56.320]   We'll give it a try. Have you used an R. G. We know to animate the Grinch mitt because no, no,
[00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:03.360]   hand animation green stuff in my mouth, which is annoying. But I've been licking my arm in order
[00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:10.560]   to get rid of it. My arms went now. Also here to join us on our holiday special Paul Therat of
[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:15.760]   Windows. We hear the youngest, I think, in the bunch. Wow. The only one under these
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:21.200]   seats. We saw a picture of you, Paul, back at the beginning of Windows Weekly, when you were
[00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:27.520]   still in darkness. Yeah, handsome. Handsome fella. We've all aged together on this show, really.
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.120]   Yes, we have. That's what's so interesting, isn't it? Yeah, we all started when we started.
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:36.640]   We were youngsters. And now, now we're the old ones. Anyway, I thought I'd bring in the
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:41.840]   people with experience. How about that? People who know, talking about what we're going to do
[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:49.600]   this week, because it's the only next week will be a best of before we come back and do live stuff
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:59.200]   the week after tomorrow, tomorrow on will be best ofs. But I thought we should do what we often do,
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:07.280]   which is a look back at the year 2022. So I have picked the top 15 stories from 2022.
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:14.560]   And I invite you all to weigh in. I didn't do anything special. I didn't mention Windows 11,
[00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:18.880]   Paul. I'm sorry. You know what, guys, I forgot. I got something else I need to do.
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:27.120]   You sit right down and do these stories. Mr. Grinch, I didn't do anything specifically
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:32.400]   about the Conti gang or anything like that. But there is actually quite a bit of security news.
[00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:36.480]   How could you not talk about the year without some security news? Not much higher out, Steve.
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:40.640]   I might need you around the whole days. It's great for children's parties and barments.
[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:46.880]   Yeah, everybody needs a Grinch in their lives. Also, not a whole lot of open source news doc.
[00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:51.840]   I apologize. But the actually the only open source news I found was there is it was one kind of
[00:06:51.840 --> 00:07:00.320]   serious Linux security flaw, which was quickly patched and it was over. And in fact, one of the
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:06.160]   things I noticed when I get went through all the old shows to put this together was how many
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:09.280]   stories we talk about that seemed like a big deal at the time.
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:16.640]   That ended up really, if I brought them up now, you'd go, what that never nothing big. For instance,
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:22.480]   I'll give you an example, Joe Rogan and Spotify. Remember at the beginning of the year, that was
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:30.000]   a huge story that Joe Rogan because of his COVID misinformation, Spotify refused to take him down.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.920]   So Neil Young, among others said, well, I don't want to be on Spotify. Spotify took
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:42.880]   him. Spotify took down Neil Young's music, but didn't do anything to Joe Rogan. We found out
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:46.480]   that they'd already paid him $200 million. So I guess I understand why.
[00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:53.600]   Shouldn't we still be outraged by this though? Which all of it, it's your Rogan getting that
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:08:00.160]   much money. Joe Rogan spreading COVID misinformation. I think he, you know, I think they kind of handled
[00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:06.960]   it by him saying, okay, okay, okay. And then Spotify saying, well, we won't, we'll put a notice on it
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:11.280]   if it's, if it's really bad. And then it just went on a cigarette kind of thing.
[00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:16.640]   It's all snow on the water. You know, it kind of like sparkles on the way down and looks fine,
[00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:21.840]   and then it's the water and it's gone. Yeah. So now there are 14. Now there are 14 topics.
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:27.920]   Yeah, it's our media. But there was plus plus Joe Rogan got out jerked by miles. That was the
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:31.520]   other thing. He was kind of the big jerk of media. And now of course we have a much bigger one.
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:34.560]   We'll get to it some point. Yeah. That's exactly what happened. It became less
[00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:41.600]   it seemed mild. In fact, compared to jerk bar went up. But way higher. Way higher. Yeah.
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:47.120]   Yeah. The mix also, it's also human nature, right? That outrage does it last very long. This is the
[00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:50.480]   problem that politicians are always having. Oh, you need to think around with me more Steve.
[00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:52.240]   Oh, raise can last for a really long time.
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:09:00.800]   He's still mad about ads in the Windows 11 menu bar. Don't get started here. Don't get started.
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:06.160]   The big story that did last in last at all, years started in February, which was of course
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:12.800]   the invasion of Ukraine by Russia. And it turned out to be a fairly big tech story. A lot of,
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:18.320]   you know, tech companies got involved. We had stories from the Washington Post about how Google
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:23.920]   Maps was being used to track the Russian invasion of Ukraine. In fact, one of the most
[00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:28.160]   interesting things that came out of Ukraine is that you don't have to be a secret agent
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:36.080]   to gather information about what's going on in not only in this war, but in general,
[00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:43.200]   because of the internet so much stuff is online now that in fact the NSA and the CIA created
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:51.280]   groups to go out and go through public information for their, for their, you know, reports for their
[00:09:51.840 --> 00:10:02.560]   research. Also in the story, Russia cutting off Facebook and Twitter, trying to protect
[00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:07.920]   their populace from any information about the invasion. We even had video from Twitter of
[00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:14.400]   Russian police asking on the streets to see Russian citizens smartphones and see what they
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:16.160]   were doing, what they were doing with them.
[00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:25.280]   I think one of the interesting questions is we're seeing all this technology leaving Russia.
[00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:30.960]   We are hearing that the professionals have all left and you wonder like, okay, what will happen
[00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:36.400]   when this gets resolved? Do they come back? Do they go back? Yeah. And if not, how can Russia,
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:42.800]   how can any modern large country exist these days without its technological base? How does it
[00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:48.160]   have an economy that functions? I talked this morning with a new advertiser who had a team in
[00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:55.440]   Russia, mostly composed of young men, they got them all out because they were worried about
[00:10:55.440 --> 00:11:00.480]   being conscripted. And they, so they were happy to go and some of them are in Montenegro,
[00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:05.120]   some of them are in Poland, they got them out, which I thought was quite easily gone.
[00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:10.080]   I don't think this is in the notes, but all of the companies that left Russia because of this,
[00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:14.240]   not just tech companies, but other companies, right? So the Donalds,
[00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:18.560]   McDonalds are going to say there's some company operating out of McDonald's locations that is not
[00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:28.080]   McDonald's. But they have a Horosho Mac. I don't know. They name it the new McDonalds,
[00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:33.920]   it's called Big Hit. And it looks a lot like it. The new rep. That's enough.
[00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:42.240]   The Kuzno Itchka is in the old Russian McDonald's stores, which I guess I'm told,
[00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:45.600]   oh, they're slogan is tasty. And that's it.
[00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:52.080]   I thought it would be tasty. And if that, if that,
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:56.720]   what don't ask what's in meat, but it's like meat.
[00:11:56.720 --> 00:12:04.480]   That there are companies that stayed in Ukraine, though. In fact, a lot of our tech companies did.
[00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:09.360]   That's right. Mac Paul, a company stated. Grammarly, state of Ukraine. We had a story this year
[00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:15.600]   about a company that did Darth Vader's voice. Of course, James Earl Jones aging out of that role.
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:20.720]   And that company, which was creating an artificial version of James Earl Jones voice,
[00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:25.040]   was in Ukraine. In fact, the story was kind of horrific because it talked about the programmers,
[00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:31.760]   huddling in the basement while there while Kiev was being bombarded and still working because
[00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:39.120]   they were on deadline to get it out. Yeah. I mean, now this is a story that is not over. This
[00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:45.440]   is one of those stories that did have legs. Absolutely. I think the internet angle to it so much is
[00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:52.480]   Zelensky and his use of the internet. Right. Speak to the world, to his country,
[00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:58.320]   to keep everybody together. I think that if there were no internet or there were no internet there,
[00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:02.560]   it would have been very different. And showed us pictures of the horrors. I mean,
[00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:08.400]   like we saw like in real time, what was going on? It's just hard to discount that.
[00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:13.520]   Zelensky, by the way, Time Magazine named as Person of the Year just this week.
[00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:22.480]   And I think rightly so. Quite a leader. It just shows you sometimes you elect somebody who with
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:28.320]   a TV background, it's a good thing. He clearly knows how to work in the media. He was a comedian
[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:35.280]   who played in a Ukrainian comedy TV show, the president of Ukraine. And I guess did it so well
[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:41.760]   that he got elected as actual president. I think he's also the shortest world leader since Napoleon,
[00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:46.640]   but that may be wrong. How tall is he doing now? He's shorter than anybody's with. As I don't
[00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:50.400]   know how tall that is. Yeah, he does seem to be the head below it. Although I have to say,
[00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:57.200]   Lee said I visited in the Elizé Palace with President Sarkozy, and he was ranked less and
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:01.600]   still didn't go up to our shoulders. So yeah, he may not be the all time smallest. We have to
[00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:05.280]   screw those two guys up and see what he's doing. Put him head to head back to back.
[00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:10.000]   You know what? He's small in stature. He's huge. He's huge. He's huge.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.240]   Other way for his. He was in their dancing with the stars thing too. He was like a
[00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:20.560]   dancer. That's wild. That's wild. Yeah. The hacker collective anonymous,
[00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:28.080]   this was in a day after the invasion declared cyber war against Russia. They disabled a state
[00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:35.040]   news site. But Steve, I don't think that was it. I don't remember reading a lot more about that.
[00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:42.400]   I think one of the interesting consequences of this were the sanctions that were levied against
[00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:52.480]   Russia, and then there's subsequent inability to get cyber currency transferred into them,
[00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:56.720]   which caused all kinds of problems for their traditional ransomware operations.
[00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:05.600]   You remember that I can was asked to revoke the dot r u Russian internet TLD and other Russian
[00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:10.480]   domains and said, yeah, no, we're not going to do that. And that was the right thing to do. I think
[00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:17.520]   right. Yes. Yes. Yes. Let's see. Well, it's interesting, Leo. It's like what I'm learning on
[00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:22.800]   on Mastodon. Everything I know you're learning something on Mastodon because you taught me everything.
[00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:31.040]   I know is that is that reflex to ban is really interesting to watch like that.
[00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:36.720]   There's somebody bad on that server. You must ban that entire server versus no, let people have
[00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:42.000]   the choice of whom they choose to ban. And you see that kind of geopolitics play out at a tiny
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.200]   federated level. It's just fascinating. That's kind of a good point. I didn't even think of that. I
[00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:50.720]   get always many reports every day as an administrator of our own Mastodon instance.
[00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:54.880]   I'm going to apologize about that. I say, please suspend Paul.
[00:15:54.880 --> 00:16:00.800]   No, they don't say that. Or I'm going to follow you on my jokes, basically.
[00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:07.760]   No, but they do. I do see that. And in most cases, I say, you know, you should ban them from your
[00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:12.880]   feed, but they're not committing a crime that would cause them to be banned from the Fed.
[00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:18.960]   And did we just hear that the Senate passed unanimously to ban TikTok by voice vote,
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:25.120]   acclamation, and here for the moral panic banner. Yeah. Yeah. We're going to get to that, actually.
[00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:28.480]   That'll be in our in memoriam section. No, no, that'll be we will get.
[00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:34.000]   I should, you know, I'll give you a rundown of what we're going to talk about. We started with
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.320]   Ukraine. We'll be talking about the crypto crash. These are what I kind of going through all of
[00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:43.680]   our old shows. So these were the stories that kind of as a as a as a whole had an important,
[00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:52.000]   Steve's hiding his face. He doesn't want to talk about that acquisitions. There were quite a few,
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:59.520]   some made it, some didn't the metaverse Twitter and Musk. Yeah, we have to. Apple, the tech worker
[00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:05.440]   revolt. We will talk a little bit about hacking, like a bit of social. That's where we'll talk
[00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:12.400]   about TikTok, past keys, the streaming wars, the AI revolution, science. And then we'll go through
[00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:16.320]   a list of some of the people who we lost this year. We're going to cover.
[00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:20.320]   Will you be serving dinner? And yeah, no, it's not going to be that long. I'm going to move this
[00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:26.240]   along. I promise. Actually, I was going to ask you, Steve, because talking about Ukraine, one of
[00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:32.400]   the things I think everybody feared, certainly I did, was a Russian cyber war against the West.
[00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:39.200]   That didn't seem to happen. No, not against us. Although the Ukraine has been having huge problems
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:44.240]   across their border, not surprisingly. Although it's been for TAT, they've also been
[00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:54.320]   attacking in Russia as well. So to me, one of the really weird things is how differently we regard
[00:17:54.320 --> 00:18:02.320]   warfare cyber versus conventional. It's almost like cyber is allowed to go on
[00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:09.280]   underneath the cover. But because no one immediately dies when something explodes, it's like, well,
[00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:15.280]   okay, we're going to get back at them. It's just this weird, I don't know, dichotomy we have at this
[00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:21.040]   point. How are the Ukrainians doing at cyber, Steve, at both the feds? They're holding their own.
[00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:27.520]   It's really remarkable, I think. And they're under attack. You can't really defend against
[00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:36.640]   DDoS attacks. So they're being DDoSed and ransomware attacks. So there's a lot of
[00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:41.760]   back and forth across the border. But it seems that they're giving as good as they're getting.
[00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:48.640]   I to some degree, I think Russia's maybe waging a proxy war against the West by
[00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:53.200]   counting and seeing all the ransomware groups within its borders.
[00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:58.480]   They're kind of tacitly saying, yeah, you go ahead, you go ahead, you go ahead,
[00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:03.440]   attack American companies. But it's interesting that both the US and Russia
[00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:08.560]   are acting about cyber warfare somewhat like they would be acting like nuclear warfare,
[00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:12.480]   because the potential for mutually assured destruction is significant.
[00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:21.280]   Well, it isn't Russia attacking the US or the West in several ways, kind of all the time,
[00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:25.760]   anyway, to some degree as a government. I don't well, the GRU. Yeah, of course. Yeah,
[00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:32.080]   on the internet, what so called internet research agency that was the Russian bots that we're using
[00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:38.800]   Twitter for misinformation and trolling to that degree. But what I was thinking more is like
[00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:45.200]   taken down the grid, attacking some of our big. Yeah, that's terrorism. Yeah, financial system.
[00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:53.440]   Honestly, I'm not sure, but I feel like we are somewhat vulnerable in those critical areas.
[00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:59.200]   But what protects us is the fear that we would do it back. I think that it must be the case that
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:06.640]   we both sides are deeply penetrated into each other's networks. And so it's, as you say, let's,
[00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:12.480]   just leave well enough alone and let's go look at Ukraine instead. Yeah, some have said there
[00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:18.080]   should be a Geneva Convention for cyber warfare to make some stuff off limits as we have done with
[00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:24.400]   for instance, chemical weapons. Doesn't mean you wouldn't have things happening. Electronic
[00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:31.360]   arts in other reactions scrubs the Russian soccer teams from its FIFA and hockey games.
[00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:41.200]   That's what's wrong with FIFA. Yeah, it cracks me up to watch the Olympics and other sports and
[00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:46.480]   see people who are clearly, it's the Russian team, but they're not allowed to play under the Russian
[00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:56.800]   flag. So they're under the IOC flag, but it's the, come on. It's a thin, thin veil. Yeah.
[00:20:56.800 --> 00:21:01.280]   You know what though, that probably works pretty well against Putin, right? That's
[00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:07.200]   basically a way to embarrass that country on a world stage. Interesting. Anything violent,
[00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:10.400]   right? Yeah, good point. Yeah, it probably gets under his skin.
[00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:16.000]   White House took this occasion, the war in Ukraine to brief TikTok stars.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:22.080]   So funny how at the beginning of the year, it was like, well, let's tell all the TikTokkers about
[00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:29.680]   this. And then at the end of the year, let's ban all the TikTokkers about this. TikTokkers
[00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:36.880]   literally were invited into the White House. It wasn't just for this. So here's the TikTokkers.
[00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:42.480]   The White House invited me and other creators to talk about the Ukraine decades in journalism.
[00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:45.440]   But no, this guy definitely gets to go to the White House. Well, no problem.
[00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:51.520]   Yes. So I had mixed feelings about it too. That's right. It's like, well, they'll be easy to persuade,
[00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:56.000]   right? Because they don't have the built-in calluses that a journalist might have.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.760]   On the other hand, don't, this is who kids listen to these days.
[00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:05.360]   Yes. I mean, maybe Captain Crunch and Tony the Tire could go next.
[00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:08.320]   Oh my grubby.
[00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:18.080]   So you said I wasn't old enough. Yeah. No, you're definitely in there. You've earned your stripes.
[00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:24.480]   Finally, it was also an occasion for the tech industry to gather and raise money for Ukraine.
[00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:32.400]   Really, Fortnite had a two-week fundraiser within the game raised $144 million.
[00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:36.560]   Imagine how much they could have raised if they were on iOS.
[00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:46.800]   Actually, we often kind of look down our nose at gamers, but I have to say, when it comes to
[00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:52.400]   charity, I don't think Paul's not you. No. Paul loves the gamers. As long as they're playing
[00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:59.440]   Call of Duty and they're not tea bagging him anyway. He loves some of the game. But no,
[00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:03.040]   we often badmouthed them. But really, when it comes to charity events like this, gamers
[00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:10.640]   stepped up every single time. It's really kind of impressive. The game raised $36 million in its
[00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:18.160]   first day alone. The final total $144 million going to several aid groups, including direct relief,
[00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:24.320]   the UN, high commissioners for refugees, the UN Children's Fund UNICEF, and the World Food Program.
[00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:32.480]   League of Legends riot games raised $5.5 million, humble bundle $20 million, games on
[00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:39.360]   HIO 6 million dollars. How much did Twitch raise for Ukraine relief? Not a penny. So there.
[00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:48.640]   All right. That's the war in Ukraine seen in hindsight. What is amazing is it's still going on.
[00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:53.600]   In fact, I saw on PolitiFact, they actually had a post that saying, "No, the war in Ukraine is not
[00:23:53.600 --> 00:24:00.880]   over." We fact checked it. Yeah. In fact, it's escalated at this point. Russia is showing
[00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:06.720]   nuclear missiles being loaded into silos as a way of kind of saber rattling.
[00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:12.560]   Cutting off all the power and water is escalation. It's in a way from the population.
[00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:16.400]   Yeah. It's terrorism. So that war is absolutely going,
[00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:20.720]   ironically, Russia's claiming that attacks on its basis are terrorism. I don't think so.
[00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:27.600]   That's called war. Our sympathies to people in Ukraine still suffering. It has been a long year,
[00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:33.120]   and that looks to continue on. We're going to take a little break and see, I'm moving it so long.
[00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:36.880]   It's going to be over fast. Just like COVID.
[00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:45.520]   It'll be gone by April. Don't worry. You won that one. I don't know about the Ukraine,
[00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:48.080]   but we got COVID. You have to mute the strains.
[00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:53.520]   The Grinch. Very well. Here's the deal. Paul doesn't need a costume to be the Grinch.
[00:24:53.520 --> 00:25:00.080]   He's got it down. I'll come down. Paul, no, no, please don't. That's what you're looking for.
[00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:03.120]   Oh, that's what I look for. Yeah. Paul's the grumpy one.
[00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:08.880]   Jeff's happy not to be the grumpy one. Yeah. Steve Gibson. And of course, Doc Serrel's a great
[00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:17.680]   team of Grumpy, old men on the show today, our holiday special. Our show today brought to you by
[00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:25.440]   eight sleep. Lisa, I can say this. I mean, we slept very well last night, didn't we?
[00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:33.280]   Cozy. It was warm. It was literally freezing outside, but we were just gently
[00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:39.920]   cossed into sleep by our eight sleep pod. Eight sleep cells are mattress, and they sell a pod.
[00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:45.360]   We like our mattress, so we got the pod, which is just like a mattress cover, but it does an
[00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:52.560]   amazing thing. It fits like a fitted sheet on your mattress and then dynamically and cools and heats
[00:25:52.560 --> 00:26:00.240]   each side of the bed. And so Lisa likes it pretty hot. She even sometimes says,
[00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:05.680]   I'm turning it up to 10, which is basically volcanic. I don't like it quite so hot. I don't
[00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:12.880]   have to worry. With the pod, you can sleep as cool as 55 degrees or as hot as 110 degrees.
[00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:17.200]   And you might say, well, that's nice in the summer and where, but it's more than complicated in that
[00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:23.520]   fact. The sleep doctor built into your pod cover will notice the room temperature will notice you
[00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:29.200]   and what sleep level you're at and help ease you into a deeper sleep. That's what's really cool
[00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:33.680]   about this. One of the things that really the magical things about the eight sleep pod cover.
[00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:39.360]   So I often start kind of toasty warm because it's cold and I get in bed. And then as I fall
[00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:44.720]   into a deeper sleep, it eases me and your body does this as it gets cooler, your sleep gets deeper.
[00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:50.400]   And then in the morning, I have it set to wake me up by slowly rising the temperature. You don't
[00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:54.400]   want to raise it too much because then you never get out of bed. It's just too damn cozy. I love
[00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:58.880]   it for the summertime. It's when we had those hot hot days. We've had ours for a year now. So
[00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:04.560]   we've been through all four seasons. It cools you down. You don't have to turn on the air conditioning
[00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:09.200]   and night. You don't have to turn on the heat at night because you're taking care of by your eight
[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:13.840]   sleep and that deep sleep makes such a difference. You can be more confident your mind and body or
[00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:19.760]   moving through those restorative sleep changes, which make such a big difference for physical
[00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:26.160]   recovery, but also for for mental clarity and hormone regulation. Listen, it's not a holiday miracle,
[00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:32.080]   but it does sound like one if better sleep is on your wish list and Santa didn't put a pod beneath
[00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:37.360]   the tree this year. Look no farther than the new pod three. This is what you want. Go to eight

[00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:19.920]   special. Thanks so much to these fellows for coming and being with us. Kind of a little
[00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:27.760]   extracurricular activity. The other thing that really went through some changes in 2022 was crypto.
[00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:37.120]   At the beginning of the year, we had the board ape NFTs. We had the moonbirds,
[00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:44.160]   Kevin Rose's moonbirds, $50 million in sales, crypto riding high by the end of the year.
[00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:46.800]   More than two. What was Bitcoin at the beginning of the year? What was the price?
[00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:52.000]   Let me think because it was starting to drop already, I think, in January.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:56.800]   Here's the story from Mars Technica. Bitcoin drops to six month low
[00:29:56.800 --> 00:30:05.600]   in this was January 23rd of the year. Let's see what it was. $35,000. Of course,
[00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:11.520]   its high was $60,000. It's now below 30. It has continued to come down, of course.
[00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:15.920]   But that wasn't the only crypto story. I mean, there were a lot of stories this year.
[00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:26.480]   I think it's safe to say NFT, the shine went off the rose on NFTs. Wall Street Journal reporting,
[00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:34.400]   NFT sales are flatlining, which is bad because if you own an NFT, you bought it with a notion
[00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:41.440]   that its value would be going up because that's all you got. Anybody got any NFTs in the old?
[00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:46.160]   Now that Trump made his big announcement today, I think we're all going to be buying an
[00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:53.280]   $99 digital baseball cards of trading cards. But they're just digital.
[00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:59.840]   Somebody's saying though, and I don't know if this is true, that this kind of skirts the FEC
[00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:07.520]   regulations because he's selling something. So it's not a campaign contribution, right?
[00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:15.600]   CollectTrumpCards.com. Major announcement. This is from TruthSocial. Another thing that started
[00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:20.880]   this year. My official Donald Trump digital trading card collection is here. These limited
[00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:25.280]   edition cards feature amazing art of my life and career. Collect all of your favorite Trump
[00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:29.840]   digital trading cards. Very much like a baseball card, but hopefully much more exciting.
[00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:33.920]   Well, there's one difference Donald. There is no card. They're digital.
[00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:39.360]   $99 to the legal stuff that says write out that NFTs have no value.
[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:42.320]   Oh, that's interesting. So they don't pretend.
[00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:50.480]   No. So it's a contribution, but it's not really, it's not like a political contribution that the
[00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:54.480]   FEC might say, well, you can't, you know, you can't, it's limited. This is going to,
[00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:58.080]   you think this is the next big thing is, I mean, honestly,
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   does it say how you buy one or do you just say I bought one and now I have one?
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.880]   No, no, you have to give Donald $29,99. Oh, yeah.
[00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:10.880]   You can't just be, you can't just be, you also get entered into sweepstakes for all kinds of
[00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:16.800]   things like golfing with Donald. The site is hilarious. What is it?
[00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:20.320]   Collect images are amazing. What is, what is this? Like collect Trump card?
[00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:24.160]   Let me find it. I should, I'm sorry. I had it up on the screen. I apologize.
[00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:31.920]   Website here it is. Collect Trump cards.com. And I like some of the images too. I think
[00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:39.040]   it looks quite skinny. Did you see the announcement video? No. Oh, no, video.
[00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:43.760]   Is that the one? Should I play on the site? The site is, oh, there it is. Look at this.
[00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:47.440]   It's short. Let's watch together. Oh my God. Trump, take you down.
[00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:54.480]   Oh, he's got laser eyesight in front of Trump Tower. This is Donald Trump. Hopefully your
[00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:59.520]   favorite president of all time, better than Lincoln, better than Washington. He's bringing them all
[00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:06.480]   out. I'm doing my first official Donald J. Trump NFT collection right here and right now.
[00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:12.240]   They're called Trump digital trading cards. These cards feature some of the really incredible
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:17.680]   artwork pertaining to my life and my career. It's very exciting. You can collect your Trump
[00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:24.240]   digital cards just like a baseball card or other collectibles. Here's one of the best
[00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:27.360]   platforms in a million. You want to present? No, but it's not. It comes with an automatic
[00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:32.240]   chance to win amazing prizes like dinner with me. I don't know if that's an amazing prize,
[00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:37.680]   but it's what we have for a government, a group, a group of friends. You get to have Trump
[00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:43.440]   stakes and they are beautiful. I'm also doing zoom calls, a one-on-one meeting. Cheers.
[00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:50.400]   If I have slightly capabilities, if you want to know your future, I'm photographing a Samsung
[00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:57.760]   camera. This is not the onion. It's not the onion. It's not fake. Wow. It's almost like he needs
[00:33:57.760 --> 00:34:02.080]   money. It's my community and I think it's something you're going to buy. Did I say immunity? I meant
[00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:11.040]   community. This is immunity. Last year, I gave a family member who is a fan. It's really hard to
[00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:17.120]   believe it's real. It is. What a world. Five years ago, if you'd seen this, you would have said,
[00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:22.640]   oh, yeah, that's the onion. That's cute. That's funny. The whole NFT thing to me is a little hard
[00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:31.680]   to believe. At one point, remember, Seth Green was very upset because somebody stole his board ape.
[00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:43.760]   Which, you know, the board ape is, again, not physical. It's a URL, basically. Seth Green had
[00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:51.040]   designed an entire TV show around his board ape collection and it was upset because he
[00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:57.920]   thinks the TV show would no longer be able to go forward because somebody stole the rights
[00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:05.600]   to Fred Simeon. Well, now looking back, we can tell you there is a happy ending. Seth Green's
[00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:14.480]   board ape was eventually a month or two later returned to say much of the police raid. No, Seth
[00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:24.720]   bought it back for $297,000. Shmucket. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. 100,000 more than he paid for it in the
[00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:30.080]   first place that you know what? You know who makes money on NFTs? That guy who stole it.
[00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:37.760]   That's who makes money on it. Dark wing. What else happened? Let's see. Treasury Secretary
[00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:46.080]   Janet Yellen called crypto transformative. This was back in April. That's true.
[00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:52.480]   She might regret that today, but you know, transformative. Actually,
[00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:56.960]   that statement told me they were great. Yeah. I saw the ad and I bought more.
[00:35:56.960 --> 00:36:04.880]   The entire by May, $200 billion have been erased from the crypto market in a single day.
[00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:14.880]   Here's a quote to counter Janet Yellen's quote from the president of the ECB,
[00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:23.600]   European Community Bank. Crypto is worth nothing and should be regulated.
[00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:27.840]   Like everything else in life is nothing. Nothing is nothing.
[00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:33.040]   I regulate it. Christine Lagarde says it is nothing. Well, because people who have no
[00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:37.120]   understanding of the risks who will lose it on and who will be terribly disappointed.
[00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:42.400]   Why did we slip into an avant-garde film here?
[00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:51.200]   But it is the president of the European Central Bank. Christine Lagarde. Lagarde.
[00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:59.840]   Lagarde. She's probably closer to the truth than Janet Yellen. Jay-Z, we mentioned this year,
[00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:05.520]   is quote, giving back to the community he grew up in with a Bitcoin Academy.
[00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:12.080]   He's teaming up with Jack Dorsey to teach residents of the public housing projects
[00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:17.840]   about crypto. I hope he taught them not to buy it. I find the lottery to be immoral.
[00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:25.600]   Elon will buy it later. They should have a risk of winning with their lottery.
[00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:32.560]   That's a good point. There's a slight, very slight risk of winning, but there is a chance.
[00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:38.320]   The good news for people who needed graphics processors for their PCs,
[00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:44.720]   the collapse of Bitcoin freed up a lot of GPUs to be sold on the market.
[00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:49.120]   And then the real nail in the coffin was actually one of the most important things that happened
[00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:55.840]   to crypto. It reduced the rate of global warming. It's exactly. Ethereum shifted from proof of work
[00:37:55.840 --> 00:38:01.520]   to proof of stake in something they called the merge. We were watching this in September with
[00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:06.000]   interest because it could have gone horribly wrong, but I think they did everything right.
[00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:12.560]   It happened. It worked. There were people threatening forks and so forth.
[00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:18.560]   But as far as I can tell, Ethereum survived. That was good for global warming. That's for sure.
[00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:26.000]   Not so good for El Salvador, which changed its currency from the dollar to the Bitcoin,
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:33.760]   and now can't pay its debts. Of course, the celebrities who endorsed FTX.
[00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:40.080]   Now FTX is a whole nother story. Do you think that FTX should be conflated with crypto?
[00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:47.600]   Is, in fact, I saw a senator clearly in the pocket of the big crypto just yesterday say,
[00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:55.280]   don't confuse crypto and blockchain with FTX. Crypto is better than ever. Yes.
[00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:03.360]   It's clearly a fraud case. It's unambiguously a fraud case.
[00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:06.560]   He's going to jail. He's in the Bahamian prison, which is not.
[00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:11.760]   I'm really worried about it. It's just a fraud guy who happened to use this scam.
[00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:18.560]   That's exactly what this member of Congress was saying is, there's fraud here, but that doesn't
[00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:24.640]   mean that something's wrong with crypto. I would submit, though, that crypto enabled it.
[00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:30.960]   There you go. Oh, sure. If you're going to play a shell game, play a good one. That's a good one.
[00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:36.480]   Sam Bank with Free. Well, crypto's biggest problem is that it's about money.
[00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:41.520]   Anytime you're doing anything with money, you're going to have a problem.
[00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:44.000]   You're going to have bad guys. You're going to have a crooks who want it.
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:49.760]   If they just said, we haven't figured out how to write software that works correctly.
[00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:55.280]   So when you combine buggy software, you get buggy money. Now, God help you.
[00:39:55.920 --> 00:40:01.280]   If we had just said, hey, it's a distributed decentralized database system to replace MongoDB.
[00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:08.400]   No problem. No problem. And no interest. Yeah. And no money. In the old days,
[00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:12.000]   you would go to a bank to rob it because that's where the money was. Now you go where the stupid
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:20.560]   money is. Yeah. Just in crypto or an FT, you know. Back in April, we had this story.
[00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:26.560]   Board apes go Hollywood with Coinbase produced movie trilogy.
[00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:34.240]   I'm thinking that might be on hold. I don't know. Yeah. Board A.
[00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:44.000]   Yup Club will be a movie we think. Well, maybe it happened. They said it was going to premiere
[00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:53.520]   at nft.nyc in June. And oh, by the way, board ape owners owners were invited to submit their apes
[00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:57.200]   for consideration as characters in the trilogy.
[00:40:57.200 --> 00:41:06.160]   I guess this this in some ways relates to the metaverse because it's kind of what it really is
[00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:11.440]   is this. And I think young people say, well, you know, you're so you're so stuck in reality,
[00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:15.280]   like the physical reality man, you know,
[00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:20.480]   the room. You would have.
[00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:24.160]   Imaginary stuff can be true. Right. Yeah. Oh, man.
[00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:27.840]   Leo, did you buy ever buy an NFT? No.
[00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:34.640]   See, well, we found the bar Leo. One of the all Leo and I did games on my show is to get Leo to
[00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:40.240]   buy something. Right. We always Leo will buy anything. This is the thing. I mean,
[00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:46.560]   you found it. Yeah. I have a crypto, but I didn't buy any crypto was gifted.
[00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:55.920]   And it's lost. Yeah. Well, I lost is such a big word. I have it. I just can't access it.
[00:41:55.920 --> 00:42:03.200]   Think of it as in a 20 year CD. It's buried so deep on the blockchain, Leo. You'll never get it.
[00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:08.400]   You will get the money in the CD. Board ape metaverse frenzy raises millions.
[00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:16.000]   This story from Bloomberg last spring users scramble for NFT deeds to 55,000 plots of virtual land.
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:22.960]   Prices soar in secondary market. Of course, the side effect of this, which kind of
[00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:28.320]   cheese some people off was gas fees went up to hundreds of dollars. The cost of minting.
[00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:35.440]   The Ethereum. Each other deed, by the way, they call them the other deed NFTs. Each one
[00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:43.040]   requires $6,000 in transaction fees to mint. You know, we had a deal for a while where you could buy
[00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:51.440]   a star. Right. What happened with that? That's like one guy made it up. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Or a plot
[00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:57.600]   of land on the moon. Yeah. At least that exists. Yeah. And you could see it. Well, as long as one
[00:42:57.600 --> 00:43:01.840]   of them on the dark side, those went cheap though. So that's true. Yeah. It's more inexpensive.
[00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:09.920]   It's cold. This was a year that there were some big acquisitions. The biggest of the year,
[00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:16.480]   Microsoft's a deal to buy Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion. I think Paul,
[00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:22.800]   the biggest deal Microsoft ever made LinkedIn was half that, right? Yeah. Well, well, assuming they
[00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:28.160]   make it. Well, we'll see what happens. And that's the other side of that story. That acquisition is
[00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:36.400]   hanging fire at least till August of next year when because of the FTC, putting a hold on it and
[00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:41.040]   administrative judge will rule in August of next year. That's the soonest it can happen.
[00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:46.320]   That, you know, I'd forgotten that that happened early. That happened in January of this year,
[00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:50.960]   the announcement. The announcement. Yeah. January. Yeah. Was it January? Yeah.
[00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:56.800]   Yeah. I could prove it early. I have January 18th, Microsoft set to purchase Activision Blizzard
[00:43:57.680 --> 00:44:03.280]   Industries shaking purchase. Yep. And would you say Paul at this point, not going to happen?
[00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:09.120]   I actually still think it's going to happen. I'm kind of holding out hope if that's the right
[00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:15.440]   word that they will somehow settle this in the interim. I don't, I mean, I don't know what
[00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:20.560]   anyone else thinks about this if anyone else thinks about this at all. But I don't see any
[00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:24.400]   serious anti-competitive issues here. I'm not really sure what the problem is.
[00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:30.160]   Well, you and Lena Kahn do not agree on that. In fact, no, we do not. The FTC says we don't do
[00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:38.560]   do consent decrees anymore. So the FTC is signaling, no, no, this, you're not getting out of this one
[00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:43.760]   with a, you know, a consent decree. Microsoft did offer just the other day. They said,
[00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:50.960]   look, we'll, we'll, we'll, we'll pledge never to lock Sony out of Call of Duty. Is that what's
[00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:58.480]   bothering you? We promise never. Yep. And still they went ahead. There were other big acquisitions,
[00:44:58.480 --> 00:45:04.640]   which did go through, I think did Amazon bought Roomba for $1.7 billion.
[00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:09.200]   Was that the next one down? Everyone from 69 billion. No, there's some other, but there's actually,
[00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:16.720]   I'm not going in order. That's actually the most smallest one. App-Loven is, I don't think this
[00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:25.280]   happened. App-Loven offered to buy Unity for $17.5 billion in stock. And I'm guessing that Unity
[00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:29.760]   said, you know, we don't want that much App-Loven stock, but thanks anyway.
[00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:35.040]   I hate to say, I don't know either one of those. Oh, Unity, you do know because many,
[00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:38.880]   many games, almost all, all the iOS. I've got a gamer.
[00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:43.200]   I've written it in the indie. Yeah. But if you played even a casual game, chances are Unity
[00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:47.760]   was buying it. Dr. Meeu always in the tech world, because I'm not either. Do you always feel kind
[00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:54.800]   of left out because of that? A little, well, just stupid. It's different. No, no, no, no.
[00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:59.680]   I just, but I admit it, I just say, anyway, what I just say, that's a two for, I don't know either
[00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:04.800]   one of those guys, $17.9 billion. Cool. I don't think it happened though. Actually, I have to look
[00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:10.960]   that up. I should have followed up. That was back in August. Adobe, this one, I think will happen,
[00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:18.640]   bought Figma for $20 billion. Figma is an online graphic, collaborative graphic design tool.
[00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:24.960]   It was said that Adobe did this defensively. And everybody agreed that's way more than it's worse.
[00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:34.320]   But of course, the big deal, the one who really overpaid. Elon Musk. Yes. 40.
[00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:42.240]   You can't touch that. $4 billion to buy Twitter, basically to buy his personal posting site,
[00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:48.880]   basically. There it is. Yeah. Right. He can now be the biggest troll in the world.
[00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:51.520]   Yeah. It's amazing. He has already. Yep. He has that.
[00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:58.960]   Did take on having fun with it. That began in April. Actually, we found out later, it actually
[00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:08.480]   began in January that Musk secretly started buying up Twitter, probably in violation of SEC rules,
[00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:15.760]   because he ended up with a 9.2% stake, never reported it until April of this year.
[00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:23.920]   It's funny. The protocol calls it a passive stake. That's so passive as it turns out.
[00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:31.280]   Remember that Elon demanded a seat on the board. They didn't want it. And then didn't want to buy it.
[00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:39.040]   What is this like a Mexican soap opera? It is. It's a no-vella. It's a good looking girl.
[00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:41.920]   So in a Mexican movie, it's always an amazing looking woman.
[00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:47.040]   Even Grimes moved back to Canada. Yeah, I can't deal. No. No.
[00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:53.360]   I think it's wonderful. I think it's going to be so fun to see what happens with this.
[00:47:53.920 --> 00:48:00.400]   It is a soap opera. It's a circus. It's absolutely insane. And if everybody doesn't know about
[00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:08.160]   Twitter is going great.com, that's your one-stop shopping for the latest timeline. Twitter is going
[00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:14.560]   great.com. It's great. It is fabulous. And it's funny because the way I was going to do this,
[00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:19.040]   you actually scoop me. I was going to read all the headlines. And then I was going to say,
[00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:25.040]   forget it. Just go to Twitter is going great.com. And you'll get the latest because listen,
[00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:32.160]   it starts with Elon Musk by his 9.2% stake. Then Elon wants to buy out Twitter. That was in April.
[00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:38.480]   Then Elon might be just what Twitter needs, says the Atlantic. Then Elon says his deal is off.
[00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:45.840]   It can't happen until the bot account is on hold, not off. That came later.
[00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:54.400]   Until the bot account dispute is resolved. Then in July, Elon's out, the Bloomberg headline,
[00:48:54.400 --> 00:49:00.400]   Elon's out must lost interest in pretending to buy Twitter. Then shortly after that,
[00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:07.360]   Twitter is going to sue Elon because they want his $44 billion. Then we started to see the texts
[00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:12.480]   come out of all the people like Larry Ellison saying, how much do you need, Elon? A billion?
[00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:15.840]   Elon says, can you give me two? He says, yeah, sure too. No problem.
[00:49:15.840 --> 00:49:22.800]   All of that came out. And then the day before more, we're going to come out and Elon was going to
[00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:28.880]   be deposed. He said, all right, fine. I'll buy it. We are not going to spend the rest of the show
[00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:35.680]   then going into what happened. We're going to refer you to Steve's site. Twitter is going great.
[00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:41.440]   Does it have the auction on there? I'm getting ready to buy a hero's machine from them.
[00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:47.920]   Oh, yeah. Joe, this is the thing we're going to look forward to next year is January 17th.
[00:49:47.920 --> 00:49:53.600]   There's only 24 hours to bid, so it's going to be fast and furious.
[00:49:53.600 --> 00:50:00.800]   Father Robert suggested we do a live 24-hour stream of the Twitter office auction.
[00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:12.960]   The Axios story has a link. Yeah, I have it too. I don't know if the site Heritage Auction
[00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:17.920]   has the catalog. I guess it does. A heritage global partners.
[00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:24.960]   Bidding has not started. Everything looked so attractive at $25 and $50. But honestly,
[00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:32.480]   that's just the opening. If you go to the beginning, I put it in the chat. I think Leo,
[00:50:32.480 --> 00:50:37.600]   you need to compete for the bird. Look at this one. I didn't see this one. The neon Twitter bird
[00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:46.800]   light electrical display. Put that in the office, huh? Yeah. Hey, Lisa. Opening bid $50, honey.
[00:50:46.800 --> 00:50:52.400]   Look what I got us for Christmas. A lot of Eames chairs. One of the things that you got out of
[00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:59.360]   this is how comfy it was. Yesterday, we had the first engineer to be fired at Twitter,
[00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:07.040]   Mano Cornette on the twig. He said, "Yeah, it was pretty nice. It was a pretty comfy place.
[00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:12.000]   It was we were well taken care of. It was a fun place to work. I really liked the people.
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:16.800]   He was only there a year and a half. It's a gallery view, Leo, which is the gallery view.
[00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:18.560]   Where is it? I put it in the chat. I put it in the chat.
[00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:25.600]   So you can get lots and lots and lots of chairs where sweaty geeks are sat.
[00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:28.240]   They look like they're in pretty good shape.
[00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:34.160]   One of the mods of espresso machines. What are people sitting on now? Are they like bales of hay
[00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:39.280]   or what? Not Eames chairs, apparently. Those are right out. Those are slow chairs that never
[00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:43.680]   got into cars. They're going to get Ikea to come in and just... I think he got rid of all the nice
[00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:48.560]   stuff. Yeah, he's going to go to the Bayzos route and make it out of doors and sawhorses, I guess.
[00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:54.560]   But... Okay. They had these. Remember those, Doc?
[00:51:54.560 --> 00:52:02.400]   Those are big in the 60s. They're these kind of wickers. They're like the Buffalo Springfield.
[00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:07.360]   Yeah. They're wicker chairs hanging from a... They have the round ones, the round wicker
[00:52:07.360 --> 00:52:13.040]   things with the cushion. I wanted these. You get into and you can't get out of espresso machines.
[00:52:13.040 --> 00:52:17.200]   I thought espresso machines are quite... Oh, you should get that for aunt for next year.
[00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:20.080]   I didn't know. Now you're talking. I want to see these.
[00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:22.960]   Lammaw, it's all for the espresso machine. These are good. Well, see, the problem is you
[00:52:22.960 --> 00:52:27.520]   don't know what it's going to go for. But I figured there's so much stuff. It's a 24-hour auction.
[00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:33.840]   And there's so much stuff and you can open it at 25 bucks. These are very... Yeah. I want those.
[00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:38.320]   But these are ones you have to wire into the wall. You did that, didn't you, Steve? You had
[00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:45.040]   it plumbed? It's plumbed into the sink and water supply. Do you ever use that? No, it died.
[00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:51.040]   You prefer to go to Starbucks. It's the only... I have a bunch of espresso machines because
[00:52:51.040 --> 00:52:55.120]   I live in a bunch of places. I love those things. Larmaroscas are the best. Oh, yeah.
[00:52:55.120 --> 00:53:02.040]   Yeah. Well, maybe then, Doc, I could interest you in a manual flywheel slicer with
[00:53:02.040 --> 00:53:08.160]   Yeah. Yeah. You can't ever hurt yourself because you have to crank it. Oh, yeah. You just slice
[00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:13.280]   up a little bit to your fingers when I'm feeling it. Why would you have a manual... Why would they
[00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:17.680]   have a manual slicer? They've got plenty of electric ones. I don't... This is... You know,
[00:53:17.680 --> 00:53:23.360]   Wepo, your nose, the grindstone, when you just slice it off. You know, pizza ovens.
[00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:30.320]   Pizza ovens. Good pizza ovens for your traders. You mean... And Twitter was never profitable?
[00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:34.960]   Is that what you're saying? Well, you know, in some ways, this is making Elon's case. In fact,
[00:53:34.960 --> 00:53:39.680]   I think that that's why he's doing this is look what these guys are spending money on when they
[00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:46.240]   never... They had one profitable quarter in 17 years. He's only annoyed because it wasn't his idea.
[00:53:46.240 --> 00:53:51.760]   Maybe. Yeah. He did fire the caterers, the people who made the lunches. So this is all
[00:53:51.760 --> 00:53:56.800]   kitchen equipment. There's no longer... There are tons of jam... Why does anybody want to work
[00:53:56.800 --> 00:54:00.800]   Twitter now? I mean, really? Why would you want to work? It's not be deported. Yeah. One of the
[00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:05.440]   things Manow said is a lot of the people who are still there are H-1B visa holders. So if they leave,
[00:54:05.440 --> 00:54:10.960]   they get kicked out. And then others are there because they either need the money or and you
[00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:16.320]   don't want to go through a gap or they need the health insurance. And that's one problem in this
[00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:22.640]   country. Right. You're trapped. You're trapped. And they're just indentured. Yeah.
[00:54:22.640 --> 00:54:29.280]   You know, and I'm sure there are people there because they are fans of Elon and they're excited
[00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:33.200]   about what Elon might be doing with Twitter and the future of Twitter. I'm sure there's many.
[00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:36.240]   Although Manow made a really interesting point yesterday. He said,
[00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:42.800]   the problem with the way they fired people was they might well have fired many of the
[00:54:42.800 --> 00:54:48.000]   Elon fans because they didn't. Yeah. He said, you should have done the loyalty test first.
[00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:53.360]   And then fired people who didn't pay. Is Manow the one who does the cartoons? Yes.
[00:54:53.360 --> 00:54:58.000]   Oh, they're so good. Aren't they? They're so good. It's a delightful twig yesterday. Unfortunately,
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:02.480]   I wasn't there because I couldn't be but it was a wonderful discussion.
[00:55:02.480 --> 00:55:09.520]   Twittunes.com for his Twitter tunes. And he was at Google for, I think, he said 15 years and has
[00:55:09.520 --> 00:55:14.000]   goog tunes as well or gootunes, something like that. He has a book too. But yeah, these are
[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:21.280]   terrible. He said that he did give Elon one of these. Let me show you the one he printed up
[00:55:21.280 --> 00:55:26.800]   and gave it to Elon. And I said, well, what did Elon say? He said, well, not much. This is the
[00:55:26.800 --> 00:55:32.480]   one he gave to Elon. He said, give it him an NFT. Why are you giving them the actual artwork?
[00:55:32.480 --> 00:55:37.600]   Why waste the real thing when you give them an NFT? So the cartoon, he's,
[00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:44.800]   Elon's in a shop that has a lot of ceramic logos for all the big tech companies, Disney and Google
[00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:51.280]   and Meta and Snapchat. And unfortunately, the one for Twitter has fallen on the floor and smashed.
[00:55:52.400 --> 00:55:58.000]   The shop owner says, you break it, you buy it. And did you hear Jeff that he says this was
[00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:04.640]   inspired by Stacey? By Stacey? Yes. Well, our own Stacey Higginbotham said that on one of the shows,
[00:56:04.640 --> 00:56:09.280]   you break it, you buy it, Elon. And the man has said, oh, that make a good cartoon. So this is the
[00:56:09.280 --> 00:56:18.960]   one he gave Elon and right before he was fired. He is suing, by the way, because he was,
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:27.120]   he was fired for cause without a cause being given. You can't, you can't, California is a very
[00:56:27.120 --> 00:56:32.960]   employee, a forward state, not as a tunes as caused. Yeah, actually meant a defense would like to
[00:56:32.960 --> 00:56:40.400]   submit this picture that he gave me as evidence. He thinks it wasn't a cartoon was early on. He
[00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:44.480]   actually, he said, I thought it was funny that he brought the sink in and said, let that sink in
[00:56:44.480 --> 00:56:49.680]   and all that. And so he gave him the cartoon in the spirit of fun. But he thinks he got fired because
[00:56:49.680 --> 00:56:54.480]   he wrote a little script that went into your email and quickly gathered all your performance
[00:56:54.480 --> 00:57:00.160]   reviews, all the things you might need for a future job and saved him out. And he think he got
[00:57:00.160 --> 00:57:05.520]   fired an hour and a half after he put that up on the slack company slack. So he thinks that's why.
[00:57:05.520 --> 00:57:11.680]   But he doesn't know. And the law does require you have to fire somebody for cause you have a cause.
[00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:15.360]   That's to be a reason. I mean, we are an at will state, but if they're going to save for cause,
[00:57:16.880 --> 00:57:22.640]   they got to give the cause. Let's see one more and then we'll take a break. The meta verse.
[00:57:22.640 --> 00:57:29.280]   There's not that much to say except that Mark Zuckerberg and meta lost a lot of money in 2022.
[00:57:29.280 --> 00:57:41.280]   Best news of 2022. Wasn't all good news for Microsoft either. Microsoft's army HoloLens deal.
[00:57:42.880 --> 00:57:49.440]   It continues, right? Paul, but they just released a HoloLens 2 momentum post today, Leo.
[00:57:49.440 --> 00:57:55.200]   Oh, and do they have momentum? No, there's no momentum. It's like us backwards momentum is
[00:57:55.200 --> 00:57:59.840]   still momentum. This was the year that we saw stories is that Microsoft was killing HoloLens 3
[00:57:59.840 --> 00:58:05.600]   that Microsoft's HoloLens goggles left US soldiers with nausea and headaches.
[00:58:07.760 --> 00:58:12.080]   Just enough just enough distortion to get picked off in the battlefield. I'll tell you what,
[00:58:12.080 --> 00:58:17.680]   you run into battle wearing that. Yeah, I don't think the slippers can aim for that.
[00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:24.960]   It's not so threatening. Honestly, yeah. You look like a space man. Maybe that's a
[00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:29.920]   as long as they only want to target humans, then you're going to be fine. Yeah. Yeah,
[00:58:29.920 --> 00:58:35.200]   you look like a bug or something. Yeah, plus, you know, your field of vision,
[00:58:35.200 --> 00:58:38.640]   everything is limited. It seems like this is not something you'd want to wear into battle.
[00:58:38.640 --> 00:58:42.160]   In any event that Pentagon, I think is moving forward with that purchase. What was it for?
[00:58:42.160 --> 00:58:45.920]   It was billions of dollars, wasn't it? It looks like that Dyson headset thing.
[00:58:45.920 --> 00:58:51.040]   Yeah, the Dyson headphones that you're trying to hear. It's literally just an air fryer.
[00:58:51.040 --> 00:58:57.440]   I don't know what. I'm not sure what it does, but it was it's a headset. It's a vacuum cleaner.
[00:58:57.440 --> 00:59:01.920]   It's a heads up. Your ears out.
[00:59:04.720 --> 00:59:11.280]   Mark Zuckerberg, they fired. You know, we talked a lot about the 3000 or 4000 people fired at
[00:59:11.280 --> 00:59:20.720]   Twitter, but that week, met a fire 11,000 people. Zuckerberg told his all at his all hands,
[00:59:20.720 --> 00:59:25.920]   meaning told his employees to prepare for a very intense future.
[00:59:29.760 --> 00:59:34.400]   Hard core. Yeah. Total war, baby.
[00:59:34.400 --> 00:59:39.760]   It is Alex Stamos told us Zuck is, I think he even kind of confirmed with it.
[00:59:39.760 --> 00:59:43.520]   Zuck is just happy about everything that Musk is doing because it makes him look so good.
[00:59:43.520 --> 00:59:48.080]   Yeah. Nobody's paying attention to meta. No, right. No, although
[00:59:48.080 --> 00:59:55.280]   meta, you know, by February had lost $251 billion in value. I think it ended up being 800 billion
[00:59:55.280 --> 01:00:02.080]   by the end of the year, the biggest wipeout of value in history. And a lot of it, because Mark
[01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:06.160]   just said, you know what, social is not our future. The meta versus our future. And we're
[01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:13.280]   going to commit to that and $10 billion a year. And what do you think is the meta metaverse?
[01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:18.720]   Is that something any of you are excited about and want to be it? Nope. Nope.
[01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:25.360]   I have to wear a thing in order to make it work. It's not good. Well, Elon's trying to stop that by
[01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:32.000]   who wants to get in line for Elon's neural, emotional media bottoming out. Isn't this one of
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:38.400]   the most lucrative products on earth? I mean, why would you say this thing that has made us all
[01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:43.840]   this money? Yeah. Is no longer our future. Good point. I mean, that's crazy. Good point.
[01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:53.360]   Yeah. All right. Let's take a little break. We are we are. I guess this is celebrating.
[01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:59.680]   Before we go, can I just say I find myself transfixed by Steve and I I feel like I'm getting
[01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:07.360]   high or something. Yeah, because or that is like slowly just circulating like a lava lab.
[01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:13.360]   Yeah. It's like a like a like water, like sea grass or something. Did you purchase these
[01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:18.320]   Grinch mitts for this show or did you have them like next day delivery from Amazon, baby?
[01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:24.720]   It's weird. I mean, I know you're into security, but I feel like you have found your calling.
[01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:33.760]   Now, like I said, available for bar mitzvahs. It's really it's like I can't stop looking at
[01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:42.240]   he is a method actor, right? He does not leave the character at all. It's a man. He's not a given
[01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:47.200]   voice. Lawrence Olivier famously said, I can't get into a character until I have the costume.
[01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:53.280]   I need the costume before I can I can be the character. Obviously, Steve agrees.
[01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:59.200]   I'm gonna have to put like a blindfold on it. Well, pay no attention to that man in green,
[01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:06.000]   because our show today is brought to you by audible.com. Lisa is has audible our longest continuous
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:14.000]   running advertising. We've been doing that for at least 10 years, haven't we? 2007. So five,
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:21.600]   is that all seven is 15 years. Holy cow. I've been a member of audible since 2000. So I'm in
[01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:27.200]   the 22 year group. Audible saved my life with audio books when I had a two hour commute every
[01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:31.840]   day. I don't have a two hour community more. Thank goodness. But I still listen to audio books from
[01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:40.640]   audible all the time. Audio entertainment, it's your right to choose what you hear. You don't just
[01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:45.920]   listen to the elevator music. You don't pick an airline for the movies. When it comes to audio
[01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:51.920]   entertainment, choose audible. It's the home for stories told by the biggest stars, Ethan Hawke,
[01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:58.000]   Kerry Washington, Lisa and I have both listened to the Kevin Hart audiobooks. He's hysterical. It
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:03.760]   just comes alive. Those audiobooks from Kevin Hart. It's home to epic adventures, chilling
[01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:11.440]   mysteries, can't miss comedies. Let your imagination shore with audiobooks, podcasts and originals.
[01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:18.240]   I just started listening to this audiobook. Somebody recommended it. Maybe it was you, Steve. I don't
[01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:25.760]   know. You're not expected to understand this. About 26 lines of code change the world. It's actually
[01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:32.560]   kind of the name is kind of a misnomer because it's a bunch, a series of essays about code,
[01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:39.200]   the code in the Apollo 11 spacecraft. And of course, the title comes from a comment.
[01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:49.600]   You are not expected to understand this code. It's kind of fun. Audiobooks from audible span,
[01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:56.160]   the gamut of content. I have, let me see, I think I have more than 500 audiobooks.
[01:03:56.160 --> 01:03:59.440]   Can I just list the ones I've listened to in the last few weeks?
[01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:02.640]   Yeah. Yeah. Because you probably consume more than anybody.
[01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:09.840]   I do. All the frequent troubles of our days, a phenomenal story of resistance in Germany,
[01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:14.960]   misinformation nation, the Magic Kingdom by Russell Banks, Demon Copperhead, Barbara King
[01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:21.920]   Solver. The escape artist by Jonathan Friedblend is another amazing World War II story about Auschwitz,
[01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:28.960]   prisoners of the castle, Lucy by the sea. I didn't like that much. The Prophet of the Andes by my boss,
[01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:35.360]   Grassi Alamozkowski, Berkery Pictures Presents. It's just amazing.
[01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:41.040]   It's kind of depressing because you're listening to so many wonderful audiobooks so educational.
[01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:48.240]   I listened to Fletch. Fletch 1, Fletch 2. I literally just finished that. Fletch 3, Fletch 4.
[01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:55.200]   I didn't like the narrator of that one. I hate the narrator, Dan John Miller. You're right,
[01:04:55.200 --> 01:05:02.160]   but the audiobooks are so good. That's one of the things people do is they choose the narrator.
[01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:07.120]   Steve loves, I know, the Silver Ships, and there are quite a few of those. And the narrator on
[01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:12.480]   this Grover Gardener is one of my favorite narrators. There's so many wonderful audiobooks.
[01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:20.800]   And it's not just novels or nonfiction, even. It's performances, it's memoirs. Their Audible Plus
[01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:26.640]   Music series is fantastic about how music is made. You can listen to, for instance, I was listening
[01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:31.840]   to Alanis Morisset talking about how she wrote her songs and then performing them. It's just
[01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:40.800]   wonderful. And of course, I saw all the expansive novels behind you, Doc Serrels, over your right
[01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:47.280]   hand, I guess, as your son. Nice. It's nice to have a giant stack. Give me the audiobooks.
[01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:52.560]   I'll be honest with you. How do you listen to so many, though, Jeff? Do you do nothing but
[01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:56.240]   listen to audiobooks all the time? Whenever I drive. Oh, you have a lot?
[01:05:56.240 --> 01:05:58.720]   Well, I actually had a listen to The News. I listened to Howard Stern as well. I listened to
[01:05:58.720 --> 01:06:07.280]   some podcasts, but I've got Drive into New York is not a short endeavor and I listened to Double Speed.
[01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:14.000]   That's almost as fast as I talk. Oh, Lisa does the same thing. See, I listen at OneX, but the audio
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:19.680]   player that Audible provides for every device does let you choose how fast you want to listen to.
[01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:26.080]   To go to one is Bob and Ray time. People say it's wrong. Yeah, that's funny.
[01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:30.960]   Audible is the home of storytelling. All of your audio entertainment in one app, an incredible
[01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:36.880]   selection, of course, of audiobooks across all genres, bestsellers, new releases, celebrity memoirs,
[01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:42.560]   mysteries, thrillers, motivation, wellness, Lisa listens to a lot of business, audiobooks from Audible.
[01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:48.320]   As an Audible member, you could choose one title a month to keep from their entire catalog,
[01:06:48.320 --> 01:06:52.640]   which includes the latest bestsellers and new releases. You also get full access to a growing
[01:06:52.640 --> 01:06:58.640]   selection of included audiobooks. Audible originals, I really praise Audible because
[01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:04.960]   their Audible Frontiers program, for instance, is recording some of the classics and science
[01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:12.960]   fiction that never were made into audiobooks. If you want to listen to the Asimov Foundation's
[01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:20.080]   series, Audible has them all refreshedly recorded in their own studios and they're really fantastic.
[01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:25.600]   You also have get podcasts. You can download or stream all the included titles, which is great
[01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:31.760]   in your Audible membership. All you want, all you can eat. What's great about Audible is no matter
[01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:37.200]   where you are, your imagination can run wild. I've always said, your brain is much better than any
[01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:42.960]   movie studio. That's why when I'm listening to the expanse, I'm seeing it in a way no TV show
[01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:47.920]   could could bring to life. I mean, it just really is incredible. Listen about the lives of celebrities,
[01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:53.040]   journey to your best self, check out the spider web of troop crimes and discover new worlds,
[01:07:53.040 --> 01:07:57.760]   old worlds on how to make a better world. We are Audible fans here. Look at that,
[01:07:57.760 --> 01:08:02.960]   Christmas Carol with Tim Curry. That would be good. That would be really good. I might have to get
[01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:08.160]   that for the holidays. Let Audible help you discover new ways to laugh, be inspired or be
[01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:17.200]   entertained. New members can try it free for 30 days when you go to audible.com/twit. A-U-D-I-B-L-E

[01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:48.640]   your time. Did you say 2015? 15 years. That's amazing. Thank you, Audible. Thank you Audible.
[01:08:48.640 --> 01:08:56.560]   Thank you. Audible was with us before Amazon Aquarium. We've been there since the very beginning.
[01:08:56.560 --> 01:09:04.640]   Thank you, Audible. Moving along, I didn't do company topics so much,
[01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:10.240]   but there were some interesting stories about Apple, not the product so much, but Apple became
[01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:17.440]   briefly the first company to reach a trillion dollar market cap, which is pretty amazing. This
[01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:25.680]   was also the year Google decided to take arms against Apple and the "dread green text bubble."
[01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:31.920]   This is a campaign to get Apple to adopt RCS. You know that the minute Apple does,
[01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:34.240]   Google's going to say, "Yeah, we don't know. We don't want to use that anymore."
[01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:38.400]   Green. Perfect. The Grinch loves the green bubble.
[01:09:38.400 --> 01:09:48.000]   Apple also, he's being buried in it now. He's very green. Apple launched a
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:54.400]   laughable "Do It Yourself Repairs" program. You might have seen Mike Sartre's video. He ordered all
[01:09:54.400 --> 01:10:00.080]   of the two, one of us, hundreds of dollars worth a gear. You read it, but if you don't send it back
[01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:06.880]   promptly, they will charge you for it. Sadly, they sent all the tools. We had them all laid out.
[01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:11.520]   We have a video of it, but they didn't neglect to send the part. He was going to replace the battery.
[01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:16.800]   He called him up and said, "Hey, the part hasn't come." They said, "No, no. We'll let the tools back."
[01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:25.760]   He sent the tools back, literally as the tools are in the car, on the way to FedEx, the battery arrives.
[01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:38.720]   Anyway, I did you ever get it installed? No. I think, really, the message is, "Yeah, you can do this
[01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:45.440]   yourself, but don't. Don't even drive." The law requires that we let you do it. This is how we're
[01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:53.200]   going to respond. Early in the year, we heard that Apple was negotiating to buy the Sunday ticket
[01:10:53.200 --> 01:11:01.600]   package from the NFL. In fact, NFL commissioner, Roger Gaudel, even said, "It will be determined by the fall."
[01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:08.320]   It's now end of the year. I think it didn't happen. Or maybe it's going to happen.
[01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:16.640]   I don't know. The fall of Rome. There is a little bit of a tussle over what to do with the rights,
[01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:22.560]   I think. Google and others are also bidding, or reportedly bidding, so we'll see what happens.
[01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:30.880]   The biggest story, Apple's story of the year, though, happened this week. Two things happened.
[01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:39.120]   First, Apple shipped out with iOS 16.2 and Mac OS 13.1 end-to-end encryption for iCloud backups,
[01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:45.520]   which Steve, you talked about. You gave it your green thumbs up, yes?
[01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:52.480]   Yeah, it's very much green. It's the real deal. It's not on by default, so users will have to turn
[01:11:52.480 --> 01:12:01.200]   it on. But when they do, with some caveats, because, for example, iCloud.com requires a brief breach of
[01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:07.760]   that in order for Apple to show you the contents of your iCloud from a website. But if you don't
[01:12:07.760 --> 01:12:17.280]   use that and you turn it on, the act of turning it on rotates the crypto keys. And then, among your
[01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:24.160]   devices, you're on your own. Apple cannot save you if you lose access, so you have to jump through
[01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:30.160]   some hoops in order to create some get out of jail-free cards. But they finally did it.
[01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:37.200]   Although, and of course, one of the things everybody said is, well, how is the federal
[01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:41.840]   government, the FBI, how are they going to react? How is the Chinese government going to react?
[01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:47.040]   Is England going to react? Where it is against the law to not be able to offer a plain text of
[01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:55.200]   messaging? How is Australia going to react? And that's yet to be seen, because Apple will no
[01:12:55.200 --> 01:12:59.680]   longer be able to comply with a lawful request from any government, once this is international.
[01:12:59.680 --> 01:13:04.960]   We're now to US only. But I think the real thing that Apple is telling the FBI right now is,
[01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:12.880]   don't worry. No one's going to do it. Because you have to be upgraded on every device.
[01:13:13.840 --> 01:13:19.760]   I tried to turn it on, and it got a list of 18 devices including my watch and my home pod
[01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:23.040]   that had to be fully upgraded before I could turn this on.
[01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:31.360]   So it's my guess. People will say, oh, that's great. Thank you, Apple. And then never do it.
[01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:38.400]   But we'll see. I'm determined to turn it on, but I still have to upgrade a few things.
[01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:46.720]   It's just nuts. All you have to do is sign out of your account. But then I can't use it. Yeah. No.
[01:13:46.720 --> 01:13:55.120]   Leo, do you want to use it? Or do you want encryption? How much do you really want a blue
[01:13:55.120 --> 01:14:02.720]   bubble? That's the question. All right. Okay, that's good. Steve gave me a way to do it. Just
[01:14:02.720 --> 01:14:07.680]   log out of all your devices. No problem. Not a problem. You'll never be able to listen to music on
[01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:14.960]   your home pods again. But anyway, the other thing Apple announced this week, which is a bit more
[01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:20.720]   of a shock, they're going to open. I'm sorry, take it back. They did not announce it. Mark
[01:14:20.720 --> 01:14:27.040]   Gurman announced it, but that's as good as Apple announcing it. Because he's very rarely wrong.
[01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:36.000]   Apple, according to Gurman at Bloomberg, will allow outside app stores on iOS. Now, the details
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:42.080]   remain to be seen. But Gurman's report had so many details down to which executives
[01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:49.040]   were working on it. And what was going to happen and the charges are being led by Andreas Venkir
[01:14:49.040 --> 01:14:53.760]   longtime software engineering vice president reports to Craig Federighi. Jeff Robin Apple's
[01:14:53.760 --> 01:15:00.320]   top engineering manager is also involved. They said what Gurman said what they would and wouldn't
[01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:08.560]   be doing, etc, etc. But this is, Paul, you were arguing last week that Apple should be forced to do
[01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:14.560]   this. Were you surprised when they did it voluntarily? You know what? I don't want to get too excited
[01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:17.840]   because this is Apple and they're going to figure out a way to kind of weasel around it. But
[01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:22.960]   it's yeah, this is inevitable. This is this is inevitable.
[01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:28.960]   And probably a good thing, although there are some who are worried Alex Lindsay.
[01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:34.960]   Spend some time arguing against it in Macbree Weekly saying it was the end of the world.
[01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:42.480]   The corporate overlords appreciate your support. The dictatorship requires it, frankly, for control.
[01:15:42.480 --> 01:15:49.040]   But I mean, this is it's inevitable. There is, however, a little bit of a clause
[01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:56.960]   that might be some weasel words in which Apple says, of course, in order to allow your app to be
[01:15:56.960 --> 01:16:05.120]   sideloaded, we will have to approve it. And there may be a fee. Right. So there may be a fee. This is
[01:16:05.120 --> 01:16:12.400]   Apple. Maybe a fee. We'll wait to find out the rest of the free things this Apple given away.
[01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:17.840]   I'm talking about this is clearly something that the EU is mandating and Apple's nose is going to
[01:16:17.840 --> 01:16:22.800]   have to do. But I think they're going to do only what the law. It will meet the letter of the
[01:16:22.800 --> 01:16:29.200]   law exactly. And it will find wiggle room. Right. But that zero day vulnerability may be
[01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:34.880]   exploitable. Right. Sure. We'll find out. It could be you might have to give us some more money to
[01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:41.840]   prevent that. The another big story, of course, the revenge of the tech worker. If anything,
[01:16:41.840 --> 01:16:46.240]   you could say this year was the year that tech workers finally realized, Hey, these companies need
[01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:52.640]   us. And we don't need just meat machines, meat slicing machines and coffee makers.
[01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:59.520]   We want more money and better conditions. Google said the average salary of a Google employee was
[01:16:59.520 --> 01:17:08.000]   a Google engineer was $300,000. This as part of their plan to convince them they don't need a union.
[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:14.800]   We learned from vice early this year that Google had a secret project to convince employees
[01:17:14.800 --> 01:17:25.600]   that unions suck project Vivian. It was called, of course, Apple employees, Starbucks employees,
[01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:33.680]   Amazon employees, all unionizing. Amazon bombarding workers with union busting messages.
[01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:40.000]   Apple is under investigation by the National Labor Relations Board for coercing, forcing
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:46.880]   Apple employees to go to anti union meetings and coercing them not to vote yes on the union.
[01:17:46.880 --> 01:17:55.520]   Nevertheless, I feel like is it fair to say this was the the year that the the employees stood up
[01:17:55.520 --> 01:18:01.120]   and and asserted their way? I wasn't just it wasn't just tech employees. It happened to media too.
[01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:05.120]   I think there's been a resurgence of unionization.
[01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:11.200]   How much it was because people don't want to go back to work. They were very happy working
[01:18:11.200 --> 01:18:16.000]   for a lot of it. A lot of it. Ian Goodfield, fellow Apple's director,
[01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:21.440]   machine learning left the company partly because of its requirement that he returned to work,
[01:18:21.440 --> 01:18:26.720]   returned to the office. There's also this whole new thing going on with all the connectivity that
[01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:32.720]   we have now where employees feel that they're on the clock 24/7 constantly. They're having to
[01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:38.480]   work virtually really long hours just to in order to hold their job.
[01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:43.440]   Well, Apple built this beautiful spaceship for people to work in.
[01:18:43.440 --> 01:18:48.560]   Just for you. You don't need an office. You want to be out amongst your peers,
[01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:53.280]   wearing your headphones, keeping your eyes closed, hoping to walk you into those clear
[01:18:53.280 --> 01:19:00.080]   glass doors that no one could see. Guess who said working from home tricked people into thinking
[01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:06.240]   they don't need to work hard? He has two thumbs in his name is Elon Musk.
[01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:14.400]   One thing I love about Elon is he's been so willing to have pictures, unflattering pictures
[01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:22.240]   taken of him. Every Elon Musk article has a horrible picture of him. Here he is at a white
[01:19:22.240 --> 01:19:27.520]   Thai gala, the 2022 Met Gala. Of course, if you're going to have a picture of a
[01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:31.840]   at a touch billionaire, it's always good to have him in white Thai and Tails.
[01:19:31.840 --> 01:19:38.080]   Like the like the like the like the seriously breakfast at home. This is another day for Elon.
[01:19:38.080 --> 01:19:48.160]   Apple workers at a Maryland store voted to unionize the first in the US in June.
[01:19:48.160 --> 01:19:53.440]   And store workers at Grand Central Terminal started collecting signatures.
[01:19:54.880 --> 01:19:59.760]   I agree with you, Jeff. I think this is more than just tech workers that this is.
[01:19:59.760 --> 01:20:02.800]   I think that's part of it. But I think yeah, I think it's I think work changed this year,
[01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:09.520]   this last couple of years. The economic conditions changed. The balance of power changed.
[01:20:09.520 --> 01:20:18.080]   There's Democrat in the White House. I think a lot of factors. But yes, I still buy the premise
[01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:24.320]   of your category here is there absolutely this happened in tech and even among highly, highly paid
[01:20:24.320 --> 01:20:31.360]   people, they still wanted to union us almost especially because the more skilled you are,
[01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:35.520]   the harder it is to find somebody to replace you. So you carry a you don't maybe even need a union.
[01:20:35.520 --> 01:20:41.520]   You just can Google workers signed petitions asking Google not to do defense contracting,
[01:20:41.520 --> 01:20:46.960]   questioning their AI strategy. Didn't stop Google from firing Tim Nick,
[01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:55.920]   Gebru and a few others is Whitehead. But I think there is this balance a shift in the balance of
[01:20:55.920 --> 01:21:01.280]   power. People also don't want crap jobs anymore either. Yeah, I mean, that's a problem.
[01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:08.000]   Because we need to do those crap jobs. I know there's a there's a newer live in Bloomington,
[01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:16.320]   Indiana. There's a Sam's Club, which is kind of the Walmart knockoff of Costco.
[01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:20.400]   And they have similar food court inside. And you go in there, there's nobody at the food court.
[01:21:20.400 --> 01:21:24.640]   Why is it? Well, we can't we can't hire people. People don't want to work here.
[01:21:24.640 --> 01:21:29.840]   That's universal. It's everywhere. It's yeah. And everywhere you go, there's signs saying, you know,
[01:21:29.840 --> 01:21:34.480]   we pay better the minimum wage stuff like that. But even better the minimum wage often is not
[01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:40.000]   enough to it's not a living wage. Yeah. Right. You can see we have the wonder what else people
[01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:43.600]   are doing. I'm just not going to work. I don't know. I don't know what the answer is.
[01:21:43.600 --> 01:21:49.040]   I can kind of understand it because if you work for $17 an hour and it's still not enough
[01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:54.960]   to pay rent and to eat and to take care of health care and family,
[01:21:54.960 --> 01:22:02.240]   you might as well not work and and and subside on subsistence on food stamps and whatever you can
[01:22:02.240 --> 01:22:07.520]   or you can find another job now. Let's not forget that million people died in the pandemic.
[01:22:07.520 --> 01:22:11.920]   Yeah. As well. And and industries change. Unfortunately,
[01:22:11.920 --> 01:22:15.760]   you're available. Most of them were older, retired people. Yeah. Well, it's true.
[01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:21.440]   No, a lot of jobs. I don't think I'm not sure what's going on, but it's a shift. The other thing
[01:22:21.440 --> 01:22:27.120]   that's happening and it's again, thank you, Elon, is I think we're realizing billionaires are not
[01:22:27.120 --> 01:22:33.280]   somehow inherently better than the rest of us. In fact, in many cases, they're worse. Right.
[01:22:33.280 --> 01:22:36.640]   Yeah, because no one says no to a billionaire.
[01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:42.480]   They have a surround themselves with a court of yes, men.
[01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:52.000]   Yeah. It is interesting that that Elon Musk had this well earned reputation for being a brilliant
[01:22:52.000 --> 01:23:00.400]   guy and for doing some amazing stuff, you know, and and how thoroughly he's trashed it. It's really
[01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:05.520]   interesting that he doesn't seem to mind. He seems to revel in it. Well, we love it too,
[01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:10.960]   don't we? I mean, isn't that the whole line of behind the music is like they were on top of the
[01:23:10.960 --> 01:23:18.640]   world and then it all came crashing down and then in Act three redemption and return.
[01:23:18.640 --> 01:23:23.280]   We love that story. We build people up all the time to take to knock them down.
[01:23:23.280 --> 01:23:26.160]   He built himself up and then to himself.
[01:23:28.960 --> 01:23:37.680]   He built himself up with with merit. I mean, you know, SpaceX and Tesla and Starlink, these are
[01:23:37.680 --> 01:23:46.000]   serious achievements. You know, I love watching his rockets take off the Starlink rockets where
[01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:52.400]   the first stage comes back to earth and lands on his ass on a 40 foot platform out at sea.
[01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:55.440]   That's amazing. Incredible. Some amazing stuff.
[01:23:55.440 --> 01:24:00.400]   And I don't know how much of this is revisionists say, oh, no, it's Gwen Shotwell who runs SpaceX
[01:24:00.400 --> 01:24:08.880]   and engineers who succeed despite Elon. We've seen a number of anonymous posts who said,
[01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:14.000]   well, you have to understand that both Tesla and SpaceX are very good at managing Elon. They
[01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:21.920]   insulate the staff from him because he is like Pixar and Steve Jobs. Yeah, he's essentially destructive.
[01:24:23.120 --> 01:24:27.200]   And the reason they do that, well, it's more than that. They also succeed because people are
[01:24:27.200 --> 01:24:32.000]   motivated to stay because they're saving the world, right? And they feel like that what we're
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:38.800]   doing is making a difference. Nobody at Twitter. Well, no, but most of the people has not sold
[01:24:38.800 --> 01:24:45.600]   off their furniture either. Maybe. I don't know. I think there's a lot to that, Leon. I mean,
[01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:54.880]   I've worked for for moguls, Robert Maxwell, the robber Baron and others. And there is a managing
[01:24:54.880 --> 01:25:00.800]   the mobile culture that opens up. Yeah. Trying to try and do their mobile whispers or people who
[01:25:00.800 --> 01:25:05.040]   can understand and talk to the mogul because they want his money to control the mobile.
[01:25:05.040 --> 01:25:11.280]   But buying buying in doesn't mean that you are brilliant and you should control the process.
[01:25:11.280 --> 01:25:16.480]   It's also a very clear power structure. I worked at Time Inc, which was a company of task forces.
[01:25:16.480 --> 01:25:20.240]   And so you never knew what was going to happen because they bring in another task force and they
[01:25:20.240 --> 01:25:26.480]   sell their federal government. Yeah. Versus mobile land, you get a decision, man. It's a bad
[01:25:26.480 --> 01:25:30.480]   decision, but you get a decision. Yeah. Plus, just like this show, which is not a democracy,
[01:25:30.480 --> 01:25:34.640]   not a democracy. I keep telling you. Not a democracy. But we are going to think of a task force to
[01:25:34.640 --> 01:25:39.760]   decide what to do with Jeff Jarvis. I just leave it to you on his hat for a guy who wouldn't be the
[01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:44.880]   first right now. What is it you would say that you did hear it, Jeff?
[01:25:44.880 --> 01:25:51.760]   Let me go show you my code. I'm going to print it out first.
[01:25:51.760 --> 01:26:02.160]   My theory is that Elon is just having fun. We all expect him to act the way we would.
[01:26:02.160 --> 01:26:09.280]   And he's not. He's just having fun. He did not want to buy Twitter. They made him
[01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:14.800]   buy Twitter. And so I was like, OK, I'm going to do whatever I want to with Twitter that you made
[01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:21.840]   me buy. And so he's not us. I think he's just having fun. He probably doesn't want to lose all
[01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:25.120]   that money. I mean, he's got a significant amount invested. He's got a billion dollars.
[01:26:25.120 --> 01:26:31.040]   I would not want to be a huge investor in Elon's things. I think those are the losers are the people
[01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:36.960]   who bought in and thought that Tesla would be going up forever. And it's tanking now because of
[01:26:36.960 --> 01:26:40.800]   what he's doing over on Twitter. Yeah, but there's a reputational damage.
[01:26:40.800 --> 01:26:46.320]   But I think they're right. He's not at risk. I mean, if any one of us could say, oh, no,
[01:26:46.320 --> 01:26:51.680]   I got 100 million in the bank, we wouldn't be worried about our, you know, where our next meal
[01:26:51.680 --> 01:26:57.200]   was coming from. Certainly, Elon will never be poor. But even if he lost every bit of his billions,
[01:26:57.200 --> 01:27:04.160]   he'd have something. Right. And so he'd be the greatest loser of the side of Donald Trump.
[01:27:04.160 --> 01:27:09.280]   It's reputational. That's the risk. And I don't know if Elon cares. He got booed for 10 minutes.
[01:27:09.280 --> 01:27:14.160]   He got booed for 10 minutes on stays when Dave Chappelle foolishly invited him up.
[01:27:14.160 --> 01:27:20.240]   That was sad. That was sad. Chappelle was doing a performance in San Francisco.
[01:27:20.240 --> 01:27:24.480]   Somebody tried to argue that Chappelle knows audience is better than anybody else. And he did
[01:27:24.480 --> 01:27:30.960]   that on purpose. It was a way for him to Lord over Musk. Well, I don't know. It's a puzzling
[01:27:30.960 --> 01:27:34.960]   that he brought him up. Chappelle is much like Musk in that he does not mind
[01:27:34.960 --> 01:27:39.360]   pushing people's buttons. In fact, seems to take pleasure in it.
[01:27:39.360 --> 01:27:49.360]   It's funny. He did a, that night, he did a private show at the punchline for about 50 people.
[01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:55.760]   My daughter was there. And there were a lot of Dremon Green of the warriors who were there.
[01:27:55.760 --> 01:28:04.480]   Apparently, Elon was there as well. And she said he did two hours and killed just Chappelle.
[01:28:04.480 --> 01:28:09.200]   Yeah. I'm not a fan, but she thought he was, she'd never seen anything quite like it.
[01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:13.760]   And I think maybe that's, that is, that's just part of Chappelle's
[01:28:13.760 --> 01:28:19.440]   stick. He introduced Elon saying, ladies and gentlemen, the richest man in the world,
[01:28:19.440 --> 01:28:22.160]   that's guaranteed to get some booze right out of the box.
[01:28:22.160 --> 01:28:22.480]   Yeah.
[01:28:22.480 --> 01:28:27.760]   So, who's going to say, yay. Oh, hey, wonderful, the richest man in the world.
[01:28:27.760 --> 01:28:32.400]   We love you. And now it's only number two. And he's not the richest anymore.
[01:28:32.400 --> 01:28:36.960]   Yeah. Right. What venue was it in? The main, the main, the, the warriors arena.
[01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:42.800]   What is that call it? Pretty big. I forgot. It's about 18,000. I chase the chase center. Yeah.
[01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:48.880]   Yeah. It's a beautiful arena. And yeah, it's, but I think it's 18,000, something like that.
[01:28:48.880 --> 01:28:53.360]   By the way, breaking news here, Elon's jet took off from Austin one hour ago.
[01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:58.400]   So you must not have read that on Twitter. How do you know that? Yeah.
[01:28:58.400 --> 01:29:06.320]   I know that from Elon jet, which is on mass, non and virtually every platform you can imagine.
[01:29:06.320 --> 01:29:12.320]   It's just a great list of, it's everywhere. And now we all have his tail numbers. We can all go
[01:29:12.320 --> 01:29:17.360]   and get the same information. So we all know where Elon is as if we care. It's, it's an interesting,
[01:29:18.720 --> 01:29:21.120]   I guess, Streisand effect, right? Streisand effect. Yeah.
[01:29:21.120 --> 01:29:26.160]   The unit we call the Elon effect who said he would never ban the, he hated the account.
[01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:35.600]   It was, it's a college kid who publishes public data from the ADSB database. Once you know the
[01:29:35.600 --> 01:29:40.160]   tail number for any plane, you can look it up in the database. He has a bot that does it for,
[01:29:40.160 --> 01:29:46.560]   not just Elon Jeff Bezos, many, many people. Elon always hated it. Initially said, I'll give you
[01:29:46.560 --> 01:29:52.960]   a kid. Hey kid, imagine him with a big cigar kid. I'll give you $5,000 in a horse if you'll take that
[01:29:52.960 --> 01:30:01.200]   down. And the kid said, Elon retracted it. He didn't, he, the kid would have taken it. And then he,
[01:30:01.200 --> 01:30:06.480]   now nevermind, I'm not going to do that. I'm going to spy Twitter and destroy you. So apparently,
[01:30:06.480 --> 01:30:12.000]   yeah, this week, Elon took down not only that account, but the personal account,
[01:30:13.120 --> 01:30:18.800]   and all the other accounts. And made a new law, Jack Sweeney is the kid's name,
[01:30:18.800 --> 01:30:24.960]   the Elon Musk tracker is the name he gives himself. And made a new, made a new law on Twitter that
[01:30:24.960 --> 01:30:30.240]   this kind of personal doxing is, is right out, is illegal. Well, then, then Elon put up a, so, so,
[01:30:30.240 --> 01:30:37.920]   then proving Masnick's theorem, which is that content moderation at scale is impossible.
[01:30:37.920 --> 01:30:42.000]   Elon had to make up a rule, right? The rule is, well, you can't talk to these circumstances.
[01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.880]   But they said, well, that circumstance covers every photo I've ever taken to the concert.
[01:30:44.880 --> 01:30:51.920]   Number one, then number two, Elon docked a guy in a car who was playing at him,
[01:30:51.920 --> 01:30:58.720]   arguing that this was because of Elon Jet. And then Bellingcat, the great investigative journalistic
[01:30:58.720 --> 01:31:03.280]   organization, used its data to find out the car was nowhere near an airport that worked.
[01:31:03.280 --> 01:31:05.520]   Elon can't win, which is a beautiful thing to say.
[01:31:05.520 --> 01:31:09.440]   Yeah. And the other weird thing about this is that all you have to do is request that your
[01:31:09.440 --> 01:31:13.680]   tail number not be listed in real time. And it will be blam.
[01:31:13.680 --> 01:31:15.760]   Oh, you're kidding. But, oh, you're kidding. You can't.
[01:31:15.760 --> 01:31:21.040]   Trivial to do that. And Elon doesn't want to do that. He would rather have this controversy.
[01:31:21.040 --> 01:31:24.320]   Wow. That's very interesting.
[01:31:24.320 --> 01:31:28.640]   You have to hear the right, don't follow the standard.
[01:31:28.640 --> 01:31:35.200]   So much fun. So Jack has posted a link tree of all the places you can now find
[01:31:35.200 --> 01:31:40.240]   Elon Jet's location. Elon Jet Facebook, Elon Jet Instagram, Elon Jet Telegram,
[01:31:40.240 --> 01:31:46.960]   Elon Jet on Truth Social, Elon Jet on Mastodon. Oh, by the way, also on Truth Social, Trump Jets.
[01:31:46.960 --> 01:31:50.560]   So, wow, wow.
[01:31:50.560 --> 01:31:54.800]   Barn those bots. It's on Discord. I got to get this kid in the journals.
[01:31:54.800 --> 01:32:00.400]   That looks like Boeing in Seattle. Yeah. He's a Florida college student, is all I know. Jack Sweeney.
[01:32:01.520 --> 01:32:05.280]   And now much more famous than he would have been had Elon not banned him. And this is
[01:32:05.280 --> 01:32:09.680]   the problem, isn't it? That's the Streisand effect.
[01:32:09.680 --> 01:32:17.760]   Can't do anything. Can't start making 300 grand at Google. Yeah. Or become a journalist
[01:32:17.760 --> 01:32:22.880]   for pennies on the dollar. Yeah, exactly. Make the kind of big money we're making here.
[01:32:22.880 --> 01:32:25.600]   That's still making 300,000. I'll just take them a decade.
[01:32:27.760 --> 01:32:35.440]   All right. Hacking is the next topic of the year. This was a good year to be a ransomware gang
[01:32:35.440 --> 01:32:44.080]   and a bad year to be a ransomware gang. The Reevil Gang. What's the latest? I can't remember
[01:32:44.080 --> 01:32:47.760]   Steve. Are they down? Are they back? Are they back? Are they down? I can't remember.
[01:32:47.760 --> 01:32:54.880]   They're disbanded and their code got free. And so there are a bunch of clones now that are
[01:32:55.600 --> 01:33:01.920]   doing ransomware based on their code base. And then there's the Lapsa Gang, which hacked Microsoft
[01:33:01.920 --> 01:33:08.880]   and Oracle and many others turned out to be two 16 and 17 year old UK teenagers
[01:33:08.880 --> 01:33:17.760]   who were using social engineering, not particularly hacking, to get into these accounts.
[01:33:17.760 --> 01:33:24.480]   And they don't encrypt. All they do is exfiltrate the data and then threaten to release it publicly,
[01:33:24.480 --> 01:33:31.280]   which often is enough to get them some money. Because they're teenagers, they're youths.
[01:33:31.280 --> 01:33:37.600]   Do we know who hacked Rackspace? Because I'm a victim of that. I got totally screwed by Rackspace.
[01:33:37.600 --> 01:33:41.520]   Was that Lapsa? I'm on their exchange server. Yeah, we haven't heard.
[01:33:41.520 --> 01:33:44.800]   Oh, that was the exchange hack. We just talked about that this week on
[01:33:44.800 --> 01:33:49.440]   security now. But that's really Microsoft's fault. All my emails tracked.
[01:33:49.440 --> 01:33:53.680]   One of the ongoing stories of the week is the many, many, many flaws.
[01:33:54.240 --> 01:34:00.800]   And Microsoft's email server. Yeah, I mean, the story of the year has been exchange server
[01:34:00.800 --> 01:34:08.560]   problems. And so Rackspace is now facing three class action lawsuits. Some of them are alleging
[01:34:08.560 --> 01:34:14.800]   that it was their fault for not patching and updating their hosted instances of exchange server.
[01:34:14.800 --> 01:34:23.040]   It's 1% of their business. They're a $3 billion company. So they were only making only $30 million
[01:34:23.920 --> 01:34:30.000]   from their exchange server hosting, which they're now migrating over to Microsoft 365 because they
[01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:34.640]   don't want it anymore. But Rackspace is an exchange hosting company too that Doc was on their
[01:34:34.640 --> 01:34:39.840]   exchange server. Yeah. And they're a bit too. So there are a lot. I mean, anybody with it in
[01:34:39.840 --> 01:34:46.080]   their right mind outsources their exchange server. They don't. I was in their cheaper service and
[01:34:46.080 --> 01:34:50.720]   he said, no, no, you need the bigger one, the better one. I said, yeah, okay. And then it's gone.
[01:34:50.720 --> 01:34:55.680]   Fast mail. Just go to fast mail. Trust me. How much mail do you do that you need an exchange
[01:34:55.680 --> 01:35:03.440]   server? Well, it I had over 25 gigabytes in IMAP. And so they said, no, no, we have a 25 gigabyte
[01:35:03.440 --> 01:35:08.960]   limit on this one. We give you 100 gigabytes over here. And that was the whole thing it was about.
[01:35:08.960 --> 01:35:14.160]   I'm now on hover, which has one terabyte limit. So there you go. And it's cheaper.
[01:35:14.160 --> 01:35:17.680]   Hover is another sponsor. We like them a lot. Fast mail will be a sponsor.
[01:35:17.680 --> 01:35:26.320]   And that was the big casualty of the Rackspace ransomware attack was was a huge number of exactly
[01:35:26.320 --> 01:35:33.520]   like Doc a ton of small and medium sized businesses that were outsourcing their email there. And
[01:35:33.520 --> 01:35:37.840]   they're saying Rackspace is saying, we're not sure we're ever going to be able to get that mail back.
[01:35:37.840 --> 01:35:44.720]   Wow. That's terrible. Yeah. It's really bad. I mean, my entire history is there. Oh, man.
[01:35:45.600 --> 01:35:49.520]   It's bad. It's I don't want to know yet. I'm going to call them tomorrow morning because
[01:35:49.520 --> 01:35:54.480]   you couldn't get through to them at all. But maybe tomorrow morning I can. I'm so sorry.
[01:35:54.480 --> 01:36:02.960]   Yeah. So there is there is that an app, a utility called mail store home that I ran across 10 years
[01:36:02.960 --> 01:36:07.840]   ago. And I've talked about it on the podcast a number of times. It's a little local archiver,
[01:36:07.840 --> 01:36:13.280]   which is searchable. And so you can point it at an existing email
[01:36:13.280 --> 01:36:22.000]   series of accounts. It'll suck all the contents out and archive it and make it indexable for you
[01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:28.720]   locally. And the things come to my rescue many times and it's free. Really? Well, mail store home.
[01:36:28.720 --> 01:36:33.280]   Mail store home. This probably won't cheer you up, Doc, but this headline in the register made
[01:36:33.280 --> 01:36:39.440]   me laugh on the 12th day of the Rackspace email disaster. It did not give to me a working exchange
[01:36:39.440 --> 01:36:49.120]   inbox tree. Yeah. Yeah. It's crowd strike has been brought in to investigate. And Rackspace is
[01:36:49.120 --> 01:36:53.280]   attempting to make all of our internal external resources available to provide support to the
[01:36:53.280 --> 01:36:58.960]   remaining host exchange customers. Remaining is an interesting choice of words. Yeah.
[01:37:00.880 --> 01:37:05.360]   I'm not interested in migrating to Office 365. I just want to play an email. Just come on.
[01:37:05.360 --> 01:37:09.760]   Well, I think you're probably all right at Hover. And if you need more, I get 100 gigabytes
[01:37:09.760 --> 01:37:16.240]   of storage at Hover at Fast Mail for $80 a year. And I think that's
[01:37:16.240 --> 01:37:26.000]   plus a lot of other wonderful services. What else happened in the world of hacking in 2022?
[01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:33.600]   Apple, Meta and Google all were social engineered into giving hackers information.
[01:37:33.600 --> 01:37:38.320]   This because all three had access for law enforcement.
[01:37:38.320 --> 01:37:47.360]   Access, which was not apparently too well policed. So by compromising the emails of law enforcement
[01:37:47.360 --> 01:37:53.520]   agencies, hackers were then able to ask for data from what looked like an official law enforcement.
[01:37:53.520 --> 01:38:00.000]   By the way, this data does not require a subpoena. They just go, well, you're the law enforcement.
[01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:03.920]   So we're going to hand that over to you. I think that's going to change. You look trustworthy.
[01:38:03.920 --> 01:38:09.360]   It looks good email address. Apple and Meta both provided basic subscriber details,
[01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:16.560]   customers address phone number and IP address in mid 2021 in response to forged emergency data
[01:38:16.560 --> 01:38:22.400]   requests. The reason these companies allow this is because the requests are of an imminent danger
[01:38:22.400 --> 01:38:29.280]   to people supposedly. And so we're going to we're going to expedite this without a subpoena
[01:38:29.280 --> 01:38:35.680]   because we want to save lives. The emergency orders do not require a court or is your request
[01:38:35.680 --> 01:38:40.480]   not require a court order. SNAP received a forged legal request from the same hackers,
[01:38:40.480 --> 01:38:46.240]   not known whether the company provided the data. I think these this was the lapses gang as I
[01:38:46.240 --> 01:38:57.680]   remember actually. Miners located in the US and the UK. So interestingly, social engineering
[01:38:57.680 --> 01:39:06.400]   still is a very effective way to get information. Cloudflare, I think had the biggest DDoS attack
[01:39:06.400 --> 01:39:12.320]   of the year. Steve, you reported on this and I think this was the biggest 26 million requests
[01:39:12.320 --> 01:39:21.520]   per second in a denial of a service attack. But you know, Steve, there's always a bigger one.
[01:39:21.520 --> 01:39:26.320]   That's right. It just didn't go on back and forth. Google in Cloudflare, Google in Cloudflare.
[01:39:26.320 --> 01:39:31.920]   Yeah. Who is who could be attacked worse? Yeah, it's incredible. These are these are
[01:39:31.920 --> 01:39:40.080]   attacks from amplification attacks. Yeah, it's large fleets of bots. And these days,
[01:39:40.080 --> 01:39:45.760]   there's so many vulnerable devices out on the internet, IoT devices largely, people's routers,
[01:39:45.760 --> 01:39:51.760]   that these bots take up residence and then accept commands from a central server
[01:39:51.760 --> 01:40:00.640]   about which IP address to attack. I think that you could use this to say,
[01:40:00.640 --> 01:40:08.960]   blackmail, you could say blackmail draft Kings on Super Bowl Sunday, for instance.
[01:40:08.960 --> 01:40:14.640]   But what would be, were they blackmailing Cloudflare or they just were trying it out?
[01:40:14.640 --> 01:40:22.640]   Oh, it was a customer of Cloudflare. Okay. And so Cloudflare offers the service
[01:40:22.640 --> 01:40:31.120]   of blocking those. And I'm sure that we've all, one time or another, gone to a site which is
[01:40:31.120 --> 01:40:36.480]   being hosted behind this kind of protection at Cloudflare. And instead of going directly to the
[01:40:36.480 --> 01:40:40.880]   site, there's, you get a little interception page that says, hold on, just a second, we're
[01:40:40.880 --> 01:40:46.080]   checking something. And then it allows you to go through. And were you a DDoS attack,
[01:40:46.080 --> 01:40:51.360]   you would not have gotten through. IoT devices could have been involved in this attack routers,
[01:40:51.360 --> 01:40:59.840]   computers, Microsoft mitigated a record breaking 3.47 terabit per second attack in November.
[01:41:00.640 --> 01:41:08.880]   Yeah, that's where the wires actually start to glow. That's significant. 3.47 terabits.
[01:41:08.880 --> 01:41:16.800]   That's incredible. That was on Azure, I guess, again, an Azure client, I would guess.
[01:41:16.800 --> 01:41:22.080]   And that actually is the new amount of RAM that you need for the next version of Windows.
[01:41:22.080 --> 01:41:29.520]   Windows 11, 3.7 terabits required, required, just to mitigate.
[01:41:29.520 --> 01:41:37.600]   All right, let's see. I think anything else about hacking you want to mention, Steve,
[01:41:37.600 --> 01:41:44.080]   was there any other big story? I think the big trend, we talked about it on security now two
[01:41:44.080 --> 01:41:50.400]   days ago, but worth just noting is that everything is getting a lot more litigious. We're seeing
[01:41:50.400 --> 01:41:58.960]   that Australia and now Japan are both changing their laws in order to be proactive in attacks.
[01:41:58.960 --> 01:42:06.240]   They're saying we're going to go attack attackers before they attack us. That's all new.
[01:42:06.240 --> 01:42:14.080]   Is it never happening successfully? No, well, it's just started. It's just started.
[01:42:14.080 --> 01:42:18.080]   Yeah. There will be some process of moving that legislation through.
[01:42:18.080 --> 01:42:25.120]   They attack. Oh, they identify the attackers. They're able to, basically, we knew who the
[01:42:25.120 --> 01:42:29.680]   Reval people were. We just had no grounds for attacking them. I see.
[01:42:29.680 --> 01:42:35.200]   Oh, okay. And so now they're saying we're not going to wait to be attacked. We're deciding
[01:42:35.200 --> 01:42:39.280]   that we're going to be preemptive. And we're also seeing, I think it was Turkey
[01:42:39.280 --> 01:42:47.520]   that was subject to the Iranian attacks earlier this year. They're now
[01:42:47.520 --> 01:42:54.480]   prosecuting five of their IT staff for being complicit in this attack. We've never seen that
[01:42:54.480 --> 01:43:01.280]   before. So the one thing we haven't yet seen is anyone holding the actual suppliers of the
[01:43:01.280 --> 01:43:06.160]   software accountable like Microsoft, because the operating system is buggy. And of course,
[01:43:06.160 --> 01:43:11.520]   the license agreement says, oh, sorry, yeah, it's all up to you. If you use the software,
[01:43:11.520 --> 01:43:16.080]   we're not going to be responsible for what happens. I think we're going to begin to see that changing
[01:43:16.080 --> 01:43:23.680]   too. But right now, mostly, I think the story is that the attorneys are being rolled out much
[01:43:23.680 --> 01:43:31.120]   more quickly than ever before. Roll out the attorneys. We're going to roll out our final ad.
[01:43:31.120 --> 01:43:37.360]   I said we do this in two hours. We have about 20 minutes less left. Let's see if I can keep my
[01:43:37.360 --> 01:43:43.760]   time. I'm not on. Relax. We're in big categories left. But much to talk about. And then Jeff,
[01:43:43.760 --> 01:43:48.080]   you're going to be doing the honors and sing the wind beneath my wings when we do the in-memorium
[01:43:48.080 --> 01:43:52.320]   segment. Right? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Okay. That'll be good. I look forward to that.
[01:43:52.320 --> 01:43:59.920]   Keep key of seep. Actually, I do want to mention I'm actually thrilled. We've had IT Pro TV as a
[01:43:59.920 --> 01:44:06.320]   sponsor for many years since they started, I think, back in 2013. So it's been 10 years.
[01:44:06.320 --> 01:44:10.800]   And I'm very pleased to announce it's going to start tomorrow. We're recording this in the 15th,
[01:44:10.800 --> 01:44:18.960]   but this show is airing on the 25th starting on the 26th. We have a brand new studio sponsor. IT Pro
[01:44:18.960 --> 01:44:26.480]   is now IT Pro from ACI Learning. And we are thrilled that they have agreed to sponsor our studio in
[01:44:26.480 --> 01:44:33.120]   the year 2023. So thank you. And we're really glad to be participating with this because they
[01:44:33.120 --> 01:44:39.280]   have been with us for 10 years since they started. In fact, Lisa and I visited their Gainesville,
[01:44:39.280 --> 01:44:46.160]   Florida studios where they are creating the best training content ever. Of course, we talk all the
[01:44:46.160 --> 01:44:52.800]   time about IT Pro and ACI Learning for individuals, but your IT team also needs this training, maybe
[01:44:52.800 --> 01:44:57.840]   more than anybody, because if your business is going to succeed, if your business is going to
[01:44:57.840 --> 01:45:05.120]   continue, you don't want to be hacked. You don't want ransomware. You need an IT team that is up to
[01:45:05.120 --> 01:45:11.200]   snuff. And it's also a great gift for your IT team. The kind of training they're getting from IT Pro
[01:45:11.200 --> 01:45:18.240]   from ACI Learning is the best in the business. They will gain new skills, get better at the skills
[01:45:18.240 --> 01:45:23.840]   they already have, and they will love every minute of it. I could tell you how I know more than 80% of
[01:45:23.840 --> 01:45:31.360]   the users should start an IT Pro video. Finish it. It's engaging content, giving them information they
[01:45:31.360 --> 01:45:37.760]   can use in a way they love. You're getting the best trainers in the world. People who work in the
[01:45:37.760 --> 01:45:42.800]   business who know the content, but also are passionate about it. And that passion communicates
[01:45:42.800 --> 01:45:47.200]   through every video. Videos about 20 to 30 minutes long, they have full transcriptions,
[01:45:47.200 --> 01:45:52.640]   makes it easy for you to sign even just one video or a portion of one video. You can search those
[01:45:52.640 --> 01:45:59.840]   transcriptions, find that bit you want your IT team to learn about. And with the IT Pro dashboard,
[01:45:59.840 --> 01:46:07.280]   the enterprise dashboard, you have absolute control over all the training. I like the cheese head.
[01:46:07.280 --> 01:46:13.760]   That's good. Every vendor, every skill you need, Microsoft, Cisco, Linux, Apple training,
[01:46:13.760 --> 01:46:20.560]   security, cloud, more than 6,800 hours of training ranging from technical skills to compliance,
[01:46:20.560 --> 01:46:27.840]   even to soft skills like marketing. It's all there. And it helps your team be ready for any threat,
[01:46:28.480 --> 01:46:34.320]   any system upgrade, any new software release. They are up to date on everything going on in the
[01:46:34.320 --> 01:46:39.920]   business in IT. And they can watch it at home, on their TV, they can watch it on their phone,
[01:46:39.920 --> 01:46:46.640]   they can watch it on their Apple TV or their Roku. That is fantastic. I really think this is the way
[01:46:46.640 --> 01:46:51.600]   to get training done. The dashboard lets you track your team's results. You have complete
[01:46:51.600 --> 01:46:57.200]   control over the seats are assigned and unassigned. And you get usage reports metrics like logins and
[01:46:57.200 --> 01:47:03.040]   viewing time, which tracks are completed and so forth. So you really have control and beautiful
[01:47:03.040 --> 01:47:08.080]   visual reports that make it easy to justify the spend to the higher ups as well. You're going to

[01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:54.160]   as a signature sponsor for the year 2023. It's it makes a big difference for us for our operation.
[01:47:54.960 --> 01:47:58.640]   But also it's a great partnership. We love these guys. We've been with them for a long time.
[01:47:58.640 --> 01:48:02.240]   And I think one of the one of the reasons they want to do it, they want to get the word out.
[01:48:02.240 --> 01:48:06.480]   They've got they've got a new partnership that really is going to make us even better. IT Pro
[01:48:06.480 --> 01:48:15.120]   from ACI learning. Welcome guys. And we thank you for your support. All right. Moving on. We did
[01:48:15.120 --> 01:48:21.360]   hacking. There was some some important stuff that happened in government. It's funny. A lot of
[01:48:21.360 --> 01:48:27.600]   times what government does is irrelevant to what we talk about. But the CHIPS Act passed this year
[01:48:27.600 --> 01:48:37.280]   in April. Actually it didn't pass in April. It passed in July. But that gave 52 billion dollars
[01:48:37.280 --> 01:48:44.080]   to build new us new US Foundries. TSMC broke ground shortly after in Arizona. So did Intel.
[01:48:45.600 --> 01:48:51.120]   That was a big deal. Really big deal. And then the other action that made a big difference
[01:48:51.120 --> 01:48:58.960]   from government was the US decision to block sale of technology to China, some chip technology
[01:48:58.960 --> 01:49:06.960]   and others claiming that China was using it to crack our our encryption and for military uses.
[01:49:06.960 --> 01:49:15.120]   This has been a very big deal for a lot of these companies and certainly a big deal for China.
[01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:22.000]   A success would you say? I don't know how you block technology. That just sort of seems like
[01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:28.960]   an oxymoron to me. In a world of the internet where their technology is available, if it's in
[01:49:28.960 --> 01:49:35.200]   use in the United States, somehow China's not going to find out about it. That's just ridiculous.
[01:49:35.200 --> 01:49:42.320]   Yeah. One of the technologies that they are being prohibited from using is a TSMC technology
[01:49:42.320 --> 01:49:48.400]   called EUV. It's actually manufactured by a Dutch firm. The Dutch are also blocking
[01:49:48.400 --> 01:49:54.640]   the sale of equipment to China. Without EUV, China can't build the very small
[01:49:54.640 --> 01:50:03.040]   five nanometer and three nanometer processes. But you're absolutely right.
[01:50:03.040 --> 01:50:07.040]   Like a China's not going to be able to duplicate the technology on their own if they can't buy it.
[01:50:07.040 --> 01:50:12.960]   They'd rather buy it, but if they can't buy it, they'll make it. Exactly. Or figure it out or
[01:50:12.960 --> 01:50:17.920]   steal it, which they have actually done quite well. That was another thing that happened
[01:50:17.920 --> 01:50:25.200]   this year was Huawei joined a number of other Chinese companies blocked from US companies
[01:50:25.200 --> 01:50:32.720]   for that very reason. They didn't want Huawei to put spy equipment into the United States.
[01:50:34.240 --> 01:50:39.200]   Anyway, the chips act, I think, unbalance a very good thing that will make a difference.
[01:50:39.200 --> 01:50:45.840]   One of the biggest stories of the year, of course, supply chain. Has that eased up?
[01:50:45.840 --> 01:50:49.760]   How did supply chain Paul hit the PC market?
[01:50:49.760 --> 01:50:57.280]   Sorry. It didn't, Leo, because PC sales fell through the floor.
[01:50:57.280 --> 01:50:58.240]   Oh, there you go.
[01:51:00.880 --> 01:51:04.720]   No, actually, there are a lot of indications that this is starting to ease up depending on the market.
[01:51:04.720 --> 01:51:08.240]   But that's maybe why the sales fell through the floor or was it lack of demand?
[01:51:08.240 --> 01:51:11.920]   No, no, no. This was just a post-pandemic hangover.
[01:51:11.920 --> 01:51:15.360]   Because Apple said, "Oh, yeah, we could have sold more computers if we could have just made them."
[01:51:15.360 --> 01:51:19.440]   Well, and the car sales, the same thing happened with cars.
[01:51:19.440 --> 01:51:23.280]   Car sales, right? Because they couldn't get the chips to make the car.
[01:51:23.280 --> 01:51:25.680]   Ford was shipping trucks without some chips.
[01:51:25.680 --> 01:51:30.480]   Sony now expects to sell more PlayStation 5s this quarter. It's month, actually.
[01:51:30.480 --> 01:51:33.120]   Thanks to this lightning up, I guess.
[01:51:33.120 --> 01:51:34.000]   Okay.
[01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:37.120]   Yeah, it depends. Sorry, I didn't mean to laugh at the PC industry.
[01:51:37.120 --> 01:51:40.880]   It's tempting, I understand.
[01:51:40.880 --> 01:51:46.480]   That supply chain certainly was a story that went on throughout the year. But you think now it's kind of...
[01:51:46.480 --> 01:51:50.400]   Well, I think we're still going to see issues, you know,
[01:51:50.400 --> 01:51:54.480]   into next year, for sure. But it depends on the market and the product.
[01:51:54.480 --> 01:51:54.720]   Right.
[01:51:54.720 --> 01:52:00.400]   I think it absolutely does make sense to have more than a single source of these things.
[01:52:00.400 --> 01:52:03.200]   The idea of a building fab in the US.
[01:52:03.200 --> 01:52:04.480]   Thank you.
[01:52:04.480 --> 01:52:09.920]   We got used to a certain level of reliability with getting whatever we wanted,
[01:52:09.920 --> 01:52:12.880]   whatever we wanted it. And I think that might be over.
[01:52:12.880 --> 01:52:19.920]   But I think it eases up. I don't know that we ever go back to where we were before.
[01:52:19.920 --> 01:52:28.560]   It's kind of tied also to China's zero-covid policy. A lot of factories were closed down.
[01:52:28.560 --> 01:52:35.440]   And then more recently, workers started rioting. The Chinese government last week
[01:52:35.440 --> 01:52:42.000]   turned back on its zero-covid policy and said, "Never mind. The doors are open. Please get up.
[01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:47.440]   We just spent the past 15 to 20 years making China the most efficient and cheapest place to
[01:52:47.440 --> 01:52:51.840]   make anything. And now the whole world is trying to back out of there. So we have
[01:52:52.880 --> 01:53:01.120]   multiple sources for products." Is that going to work? I understand. I mean, Apple and others
[01:53:01.120 --> 01:53:06.960]   are saying we're going to manufacture in India, in Brazil, in Vietnam. But of course,
[01:53:06.960 --> 01:53:10.720]   there's some concern also about the future of Taiwan, which right now is another place.
[01:53:10.720 --> 01:53:17.760]   TSMC is a Taiwanese company that ships are manufactured. But is it going to work? Can Apple,
[01:53:17.760 --> 01:53:24.560]   which has 300,000 workers in iPhone City and Zhengzhou, China building iPhones, can they somehow move
[01:53:24.560 --> 01:53:32.160]   that to the US? No. I think Apple is the test case for this, the poster child, because they are
[01:53:32.160 --> 01:53:39.200]   so prominent and so big. And they have said publicly, I believe, they want to do it, but it's
[01:53:39.200 --> 01:53:44.160]   going to take a while. You don't just flip a switch and iPhones are coming out of Vietnam or whatever.
[01:53:44.160 --> 01:53:49.200]   It's hard. The other really interesting thing is all the saber rattling that China is doing with
[01:53:49.200 --> 01:53:55.520]   regard to Taiwan, China needs the chips from TSMC just as much as the rest of the world does.
[01:53:55.520 --> 01:54:04.320]   If you've ever looked at the fab inside TSMC, it is the most fragile technology that we have ever
[01:54:04.320 --> 01:54:12.160]   created on the planet. You can't sneeze within a block of that facility and not have it completely
[01:54:12.160 --> 01:54:19.680]   blow your process. So there's no way that China can be aggressive toward Taiwan without risking
[01:54:19.680 --> 01:54:25.600]   totally shutting down the world, the global supply of chips. And they can't afford that any more than
[01:54:25.600 --> 01:54:31.600]   we can. You know, what's interesting too, though, is it's not just the technology industry.
[01:54:31.600 --> 01:54:38.640]   I was talking to a board member of a drywall company and the pressure on them to disconnect
[01:54:38.640 --> 01:54:44.160]   from China. The entire push over the last, as you said, Paul, 15 years is let's do everything in
[01:54:44.160 --> 01:54:48.560]   China, let's move everything in China, let's make it cheaper, let's help the economy. And now there's
[01:54:48.560 --> 01:54:54.480]   tremendous political pressure to cut off those ties. And it's happening across the economy. And
[01:54:54.480 --> 01:54:59.920]   it's not going to be easy. And I don't know that it's going to happen. Does all the gypsum come from
[01:54:59.920 --> 01:55:04.640]   China? I don't know where gypsum comes from. I just know that the news is about white powder.
[01:55:06.240 --> 01:55:10.080]   From Staten Island. You know, by the way, one thing I learned is that
[01:55:10.080 --> 01:55:19.040]   Cowellin is what coats a slick paper stock to make it so slick fills it all of it. Right?
[01:55:19.040 --> 01:55:24.400]   Is most of the Cowellin capital of the world is in Georgia. And a little known fact is because
[01:55:24.400 --> 01:55:32.160]   Cowellin is slightly radioactive. Magazines have a half life. Oh my God. And don't, don't, don't
[01:55:32.160 --> 01:55:36.720]   sleep with a magazine. Paul, that means over there to your left, you're in trouble.
[01:55:36.720 --> 01:55:42.400]   You've got every bite magazine. He's got them all. I think they've all emanated as much.
[01:55:42.400 --> 01:55:45.680]   Those are these are all there. These are made of asbestos. Yeah,
[01:55:45.680 --> 01:55:48.640]   maybe pre- Cowellin.
[01:55:48.640 --> 01:55:58.240]   Exactly. I have the gypsum stats to hand. Oh, okay. China is in fact by far the largest producer of
[01:55:58.240 --> 01:56:05.200]   gypsum in the world. 144,000 metric, I'm sorry, 144 million metric tons.
[01:56:05.200 --> 01:56:13.760]   The number two, 16 million. And that's Iran, which I think they could sell. I think there is a
[01:56:13.760 --> 01:56:19.840]   gypsum ban, isn't there? Crisis a cover. We got a gypsum crisis on our hands.
[01:56:19.840 --> 01:56:24.320]   We all produce 15 million tons of gypsum a year. We got to get on that.
[01:56:24.960 --> 01:56:28.160]   That's the sheet rock business, isn't it? Yeah, that's what we're talking about. Drywall, right?
[01:56:28.160 --> 01:56:36.960]   What plaster made of? Paris, I believe. I may be wrong on that.
[01:56:36.960 --> 01:56:42.640]   Doc has sent in the chatroom sent us a link to marine traffic. I don't know.
[01:56:42.640 --> 01:56:50.240]   It is incredible. It is a, it is a, if you zoom in on anywhere, it's just amazing what it shows.
[01:56:50.240 --> 01:56:54.720]   Does this give you some idea of why we have a supply chain? Sure, does this show you all the
[01:56:54.720 --> 01:56:58.560]   all the boats stuck outside Long Beach? Long water for Mississippi. Yeah.
[01:56:58.560 --> 01:57:02.240]   Well, you know, fewer stuck outside Long Beach than there used to be. I know that because
[01:57:02.240 --> 01:57:06.000]   they flew over it a few days ago, I thought, where did all the boats go? It's not that bad.
[01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:11.520]   Yeah. And Newark, when I flew in today to Newark, usually you see boats right there by the IKEA
[01:57:11.520 --> 01:57:17.440]   as you're coming down the runway. And I didn't see it as many. So there you go.
[01:57:18.800 --> 01:57:26.320]   It's a, it's just one view. For the colors mean, Doc, you know, what's that? What do the colors mean?
[01:57:26.320 --> 01:57:33.840]   Oh, the color. What summer oil, summer, are barges like the blue ones that are on the
[01:57:33.840 --> 01:57:39.840]   Ohio River and all of those are those are barges, I think. This is cool. I can make
[01:57:39.840 --> 01:57:48.800]   red ones. Very cool. Whether to it is Elon's yacht on this. Probably. But they have actually,
[01:57:48.800 --> 01:57:52.560]   if you click on one, it'll tell you like, here's a tanker, the red ones a tanker.
[01:57:52.560 --> 01:58:00.160]   This blue one is this here, a cargo vessel. Oh, look at that.
[01:58:00.160 --> 01:58:05.920]   It's this really cool. There's an app. There's an app for your phone as well. And of course,
[01:58:05.920 --> 01:58:11.040]   it's a freemium thing. This is the free version. But I mean, you can, you can see where the boats
[01:58:11.040 --> 01:58:17.600]   were made. Like the cruise boats are on here. I think those are, yeah, the big blue ones are
[01:58:17.600 --> 01:58:20.880]   cruise boats. Those are the ground boats over here. Yeah.
[01:58:20.880 --> 01:58:28.160]   Yeah, it's fishing boat. Wow. Sure. Wow. Yeah. This is cool.
[01:58:29.760 --> 01:58:37.920]   This is nice. MarineTraffic.com. Oh, like a little tugboat there. Yeah. Yeah, tug boats there too.
[01:58:37.920 --> 01:58:44.880]   Anything that they can locate by satellite, anything that's communicating by satellite.
[01:58:44.880 --> 01:58:49.280]   This is a lot of this. They have to let their, this is like the air traffic
[01:58:49.280 --> 01:58:55.040]   locator. This is a small one. It's a lot like that. Yeah, like flaterware has something
[01:58:55.040 --> 01:58:58.720]   to do. Yeah, left flight. And flight and flight radar 24 is really cool too.
[01:58:58.720 --> 01:59:03.360]   See what's flying overhead. Good. I want, we're going to create a new account
[01:59:03.360 --> 01:59:11.520]   on Mastodon Leo's tug. And you'll know where my tugboat is at all times. You have kind of a tugboat
[01:59:11.520 --> 01:59:16.800]   personality. I do. And so I've always wanted a tugboat. Yeah. Tugboat Leo, like tugboat.
[01:59:16.800 --> 01:59:23.440]   It's a children's story soon to be a Christmas classic. Yeah. I think again,
[01:59:23.440 --> 01:59:30.400]   yeah. A little tugboat with the Santa hat. And here comes the evil green submarine.
[01:59:30.400 --> 01:59:34.720]   The Grinch. I love it. We could write this right now.
[01:59:34.720 --> 01:59:43.520]   Pascades, I think might have been a big story. Steve, this year, this was the Fido
[01:59:43.520 --> 01:59:49.840]   authentication technology that in theory eliminates passwords. Google, Apple, Microsoft,
[01:59:50.960 --> 01:59:55.600]   by the end of the year shipped each of them technologies that would allow you to use
[01:59:55.600 --> 02:00:02.560]   Pascades on Pascades enabled sites. There are not very many, but this could be a very important
[02:00:02.560 --> 02:00:09.360]   change going forward. Yes. Absolutely. I would say that this is the year that it launched. And we
[02:00:09.360 --> 02:00:17.200]   have probably a decade now for adoption. That long. Yeah, because passwords still work. And
[02:00:17.920 --> 02:00:24.000]   it's not clear why anyone's going to switch. I think when when support is built into
[02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:29.840]   the server platforms, then it will be trivial for people to turn it on. And so like.
[02:00:29.840 --> 02:00:35.440]   Wordpress and Squarespace and Shopify and Wic. N I I S and Apache.
[02:00:35.440 --> 02:00:41.280]   And the servers. Yeah. And and and and and and and and so when it's just a matter of turning it
[02:00:41.280 --> 02:00:45.680]   on, the way it is now for for TLS, then people will go, yeah, let's turn it on.
[02:00:45.680 --> 02:00:51.120]   If you think about encrypt this, then it was an almost overnight success. Wasn't it adding TLS
[02:00:51.120 --> 02:00:55.840]   to websites? Let's encrypt. Yes. Well, let's encrypt. Not encrypt this. Yeah. Yeah.
[02:00:55.840 --> 02:01:02.800]   Again, it did take time. I mean, they said, you know, here it is, but you know, and they made it
[02:01:02.800 --> 02:01:08.320]   free. And now increasingly servers just, you know, have it built in. A couple of weeks ago,
[02:01:08.320 --> 02:01:12.800]   they announced they had issued their three billionth HTTPS certificate.
[02:01:13.680 --> 02:01:16.320]   Yeah. And about a million of those are legitimate.
[02:01:16.320 --> 02:01:26.240]   I have certificates from my Synology NAS for my website.
[02:01:26.240 --> 02:01:31.760]   You know, I I've done quite a it's just a little script you run and it generates every
[02:01:31.760 --> 02:01:36.720]   three months, you get a new, uh, cert. It's a it's a nice feature, but you write a lot of those
[02:01:36.720 --> 02:01:42.080]   might be nasses or other devices that aren't really well or they're look-alike names where you
[02:01:42.080 --> 02:01:48.640]   have to have HTTPS now in order not to get a big alert or have browsers just refuse to take you
[02:01:48.640 --> 02:01:57.040]   there at all. I remember going to almost logging into TV V I T T E R dot com. Exactly. The two V's
[02:01:57.040 --> 02:02:01.840]   looked a lot like a W. Yep. Now I wish I joined to the fitter.
[02:02:05.280 --> 02:02:12.640]   I mean, that's my new home on the internet. Uh, streaming wars, big story, the the began the year
[02:02:12.640 --> 02:02:23.280]   with, uh, an academy award for Apple's CODA Best Picture of the Year. That was in a way a sign
[02:02:23.280 --> 02:02:28.720]   that Steven Spielberg who argued that it's not a movie. If it doesn't show in a theater,
[02:02:28.720 --> 02:02:34.400]   uh, might have lost the battle. Yeah. And I think that's the future, frankly.
[02:02:35.200 --> 02:02:42.640]   Uh, the game of thrones, uh, return was the house of the dragon and the rings of power.
[02:02:42.640 --> 02:02:50.000]   The Lord of the Rings returned the big battle in fantasy TV Amazon versus HBO. Oh, and speaking
[02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:59.200]   of HBO, the, uh, mess that's going on with Discovery Warner CNN plus was launched and then
[02:02:59.760 --> 02:03:06.240]   pulled a month after launch by the new, uh, owners at Discovery Warner was
[02:03:06.240 --> 02:03:13.200]   for Licht. Mr. Licht. They've also announced that they're going to change the name again of HBO,
[02:03:13.200 --> 02:03:21.840]   which became HBO Max, uh, going forward. I don't know what to call it. Max Max. Sure. For Maxwell,
[02:03:21.840 --> 02:03:30.640]   Smart Max. Would you believe a streaming service, uh, Netflix, struggling to get that reference?
[02:03:30.640 --> 02:03:36.720]   Yeah, I know. You have to be over a hundred to get the get smart references. Uh, Netflix,
[02:03:36.720 --> 02:03:43.200]   struggled a lot this year. It lost millions of subscribers announced that they were going to start
[02:03:43.200 --> 02:03:50.000]   cracking down on password sharing. I haven't noticed that yet. And, uh, I share my
[02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:56.720]   kids in different states. Yeah. I don't see how I could give them more money.
[02:03:56.720 --> 02:04:03.680]   And Netflix is almost a car payment now. You know, well, you could save money by watching the ad
[02:04:03.680 --> 02:04:11.280]   supported version of Netflix, which is apparently a complete flop. Uh, 80% lower subscriptions than
[02:04:11.280 --> 02:04:17.280]   they thought they're giving money back to advertisers. Uh, but maybe it just takes a while to, to build.
[02:04:17.280 --> 02:04:22.640]   So the ad supported plan, uh, on Netflix is a little bit less. They disable your fast forward
[02:04:22.640 --> 02:04:26.800]   button. Forget it. I think they do. Of course. Otherwise you wouldn't see the ads and who wants
[02:04:26.800 --> 02:04:33.600]   that right? Right. Who wants that? Um, we did talk this year about, uh, our own Christina Warren,
[02:04:33.600 --> 02:04:40.560]   who, uh, was looking for some CNN plus swag. She collects swag from companies that are no longer
[02:04:40.560 --> 02:04:47.200]   in business. Well, and then he did a great piece on her in which she said, if you've got
[02:04:47.200 --> 02:04:53.360]   any CNN plus swag, I would very much like that. Oh, wow. She's also, uh, looking for it. I think
[02:04:53.360 --> 02:04:59.440]   since this story came out, got, uh, some Theranos swag as well. Oh, yeah. I have some
[02:04:59.440 --> 02:05:04.480]   little kurtle swag right here that I'm wearing. Oh, there you go. The website's still up. She,
[02:05:04.480 --> 02:05:09.040]   well, she works at GitHub. She probably would appreciate that. Now, it'd be the time to grab
[02:05:09.040 --> 02:05:14.080]   some Twitter swag and that, uh, Oh, yeah, no kidding. That options coming under. I'm going
[02:05:14.080 --> 02:05:17.760]   to buy the big blue bird for my living room. I would, you know what? I must want to, if it
[02:05:17.760 --> 02:05:23.360]   goes at a reasonable, I'd buy it for Christina. That would be awesome. She, she, she is in a fire
[02:05:23.360 --> 02:05:29.520]   festival t-shirt. That's got to be hard to find. But she calls, uh, a few things through the
[02:05:29.520 --> 02:05:37.360]   white whale, uh, quibi and Theranos finding the quibi and the Theranos stuff would really be, uh,
[02:05:37.360 --> 02:05:42.400]   would make her happy warehouse. I don't know where she puts this stuff. She's hoping employees are
[02:05:42.400 --> 02:05:48.960]   people who saved freebies from Theranos events might have something. Should I have before me right
[02:05:48.960 --> 02:05:55.360]   here? I guess. What do you got? An entertainment weekly with the original local calculator. Yeah.
[02:05:55.360 --> 02:06:01.200]   See, that's confusing. It looks like a TV remote remote. What's the intersection between math and
[02:06:01.200 --> 02:06:05.040]   people that watch entertainment. We marketing people, you know, his entertainment weekly still
[02:06:05.040 --> 02:06:09.600]   exists, Jeff. I know. Not print. In fact, was this the year that it went out of print? Yes,
[02:06:09.600 --> 02:06:13.600]   there's a was. Yes. Well, number. Like I said, they have a half life. Yeah.
[02:06:13.600 --> 02:06:19.360]   A number of the magazine stopped printing, stopped their print editions. Tons.
[02:06:19.360 --> 02:06:27.200]   A lot of those because of who's the new owner of people. Dot dash bought Meredith, which had in
[02:06:27.200 --> 02:06:36.560]   turn bought, uh, time ink dot dash dot dash is, is former about dot com. Oh, about dot com. Owned by
[02:06:36.560 --> 02:06:43.280]   Barry Diller. So the last remnants of a great magazine company, two of them are now on a, you
[02:06:43.280 --> 02:06:51.920]   know, a content factory line, you know, wonder, give me trends. And so time, ink sluffed off,
[02:06:51.920 --> 02:07:00.640]   sports illustrated, uh, and time, um, and fortune. The rest was sold to Meredith. Meredith was then
[02:07:00.640 --> 02:07:08.000]   sold to dot dash dot dash killed in style and then we have a weekly and one or two others, I think.
[02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:14.240]   This really is also the story of 2022 is the acquisitions and, you know, the, the,
[02:07:14.240 --> 02:07:22.960]   ZD was bought by Red Ventures and Yahoo and it just, uh, I guess that's what happens in
[02:07:22.960 --> 02:07:29.760]   failing industries is they just kind of become, uh, fire sales. Apparently. Yeah. Yeah.
[02:07:29.760 --> 02:07:35.280]   Speaking of failing. So they're, uh, so the answer is personal makers. Yeah. Uh, speaking of fire
[02:07:35.280 --> 02:07:42.720]   sales, um, I'm so happy to report us cable companies lost another 785,000 paying customers.
[02:07:42.720 --> 02:07:48.160]   Last quarter. Uh, it has been a migration away from cable, partly from court cutting,
[02:07:48.160 --> 02:07:56.880]   but some of it apparently is going to T mobile and Verizon for their 5G based fixed wireless
[02:07:56.880 --> 02:08:03.600]   internet services. Does that work? Yeah. Works quite well. His daughter, my daughter has Verizon.
[02:08:03.600 --> 02:08:10.320]   And because I'm a Verizon subscribers, 25 bucks a month for 150 megabits down and 30 up.
[02:08:10.320 --> 02:08:16.000]   But it's also because she's near a 5G, uh, tower. She's near our freeway. And that's where the 5G
[02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:20.640]   mostly is. Okay. Get this at our apartment at this apartment here in New York.
[02:08:20.640 --> 02:08:25.200]   I noticed as a new thing that looks like a wedge at the top of a telephone pole across the street.
[02:08:25.200 --> 02:08:33.920]   And so, um, I had my son as a turn off wifi and see if he's got T mobile, I have T mobile too.
[02:08:33.920 --> 02:08:40.640]   So at the 5G, it was forced to 5G get this 500 down and 100.
[02:08:40.640 --> 02:08:43.200]   Oh, it's probably millimeter wave. Yeah.
[02:08:43.200 --> 02:08:46.880]   Whatever it was. And he could do it on his iPhone 13. I've got a Verizon.
[02:08:46.880 --> 02:08:49.600]   Who was the carrier? T mobile.
[02:08:49.600 --> 02:08:53.920]   Oh, and now it's that new thing T mobile is doing. Yeah.
[02:08:53.920 --> 02:09:02.480]   T mobile is doing an aggregated, um, uh, weird 5G that actually gives you about 500 megabits.
[02:09:02.480 --> 02:09:07.200]   So I think that's what it is. What's it called? Yeah. Um, I was amazed.
[02:09:07.200 --> 02:09:12.560]   That was amazing. It's a T mobile three C a three channel aggregation.
[02:09:12.560 --> 02:09:19.840]   It's the mid band spectrum bonding channel bonding, uh, and it's, it's hitting speeds of up to three
[02:09:19.840 --> 02:09:25.360]   gigabits on a galaxy S 22 according to nine to five Google. So I bet you that's what that is.
[02:09:25.360 --> 02:09:32.080]   Is a T mobile three C a antenna. Interesting. You know, we made a lot of fun over the last few
[02:09:32.080 --> 02:09:37.120]   years over 5G, but this was the year 5G started to really take off and is real.
[02:09:37.120 --> 02:09:44.560]   In fact, that's why people left the cable companies. Cause it turns out fixed home internet
[02:09:44.560 --> 02:09:51.040]   over 5G ain't so bad. Whose presentation wasn't where they, they did a half a couple of apples.
[02:09:51.040 --> 02:09:56.480]   Just the 5G. Can I, can I, that was, that was, uh, two years ago, I think. Let me see if I can,
[02:09:57.040 --> 02:10:02.720]   I could, I could probably get in trouble. Uh, you've never gotten in trouble for doing anything
[02:10:02.720 --> 02:10:08.880]   with Apple. Come for it. I don't know if a big cut down like that. This was when they, this is
[02:10:08.880 --> 02:10:14.560]   the iPhone 12 announcement. So this was two years ago. Oh, what the hell? Let's play it.
[02:10:15.200 --> 02:10:23.680]   hello, and welcome back to apple park i am so glad you could join us today 5g 5g 5g 5g 5g 5g
[02:10:23.680 --> 02:10:23.680]   5g 5g 5g 5g 5g 5g 5g 5g 5g 5g 5g 5m 5g 5g 5g 5g 5g 5g 5g 5g 5g 5g 5g 5g 5g 5g 5g 5g 5g 5g 5g 5g 5g 5g 5g 5g 5g 5g 5g 5g 5g 5g 5g 5g 5g 5g 5g 5g 5g 5g 5g 5g (5g 5g 5g 5g 5g 5g 5g 5g 5g 5g 5g 5g 5g 5g 5g 5g 5g 5g 5g 5g 5g 5g 5g 5g 5g 5g 5g 5g 5g 5g 5g 5g 5g 5g 5g 5g 5g 5g 5g 5g 5g 5
[02:10:23.680 --> 02:10:34.400]   Five G, Five G, Five G, Five G, Five G!
[02:10:34.400 --> 02:10:39.560]   Five G, five G, five G!
[02:10:39.560 --> 02:10:43.720]   Five G, five G, five G!
[02:10:43.720 --> 02:10:47.700]   It is 49 seconds of 5G.
[02:10:47.700 --> 02:11:01.180]   So, a long time ago when I was in radio, using a razor, we put together a Ted Kennedy speech,
[02:11:01.180 --> 02:11:05.760]   which is nothing but his as, so he sounded like a sheep.
[02:11:05.760 --> 02:11:15.740]   He had that great hyana support and the D.O.J.
[02:11:15.740 --> 02:11:19.280]   Microsoft Office of Education in the mid 90s, but what he cut out was the gulps.
[02:11:19.280 --> 02:11:24.920]   So, it was just Bill going, "I would love that video.
[02:11:24.920 --> 02:11:28.000]   I don't have to ask to work for that."
[02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:32.200]   Anyway, Five G, we mocked it in 20, what was that, two years ago?
[02:11:32.200 --> 02:11:33.200]   So, 2020?
[02:11:33.200 --> 02:11:34.720]   It's here!
[02:11:34.720 --> 02:11:38.560]   I think this is like the past case thing that Steve was talking about.
[02:11:38.560 --> 02:11:39.560]   It takes a while.
[02:11:39.560 --> 02:11:40.560]   It takes a while.
[02:11:40.560 --> 02:11:41.560]   It's here.
[02:11:41.560 --> 02:11:47.560]   There was a time when people called QR codes RobotBart.
[02:11:47.560 --> 02:11:51.440]   Yeah, and now you can't live without them.
[02:11:51.440 --> 02:11:54.640]   Well, I was the pandemic, I've registered.
[02:11:54.640 --> 02:12:02.200]   Before you leave streaming, this was also the year in which streaming surpassed cable
[02:12:02.200 --> 02:12:04.200]   and broadcast.
[02:12:04.200 --> 02:12:11.160]   Yes, but it's also the year in which streaming had the fastest arc ever, where everybody was
[02:12:11.160 --> 02:12:12.160]   doing all success.
[02:12:12.160 --> 02:12:16.160]   And now because there's too much competition, it's on the downswing again.
[02:12:16.160 --> 02:12:18.160]   Peacock, flat.
[02:12:18.160 --> 02:12:19.960]   Disney's up, but Netflix is down.
[02:12:19.960 --> 02:12:20.960]   Yeah, you're right.
[02:12:20.960 --> 02:12:23.280]   The competition has heard a lot of the streamers.
[02:12:23.280 --> 02:12:29.200]   The investments in entertainment properties are huge and they're not paying off.
[02:12:29.200 --> 02:12:30.200]   Who, an HBO?
[02:12:30.200 --> 02:12:31.200]   Well, an HBO.
[02:12:31.200 --> 02:12:34.240]   The service to simply watch one thing and quit.
[02:12:34.240 --> 02:12:35.240]   Right.
[02:12:35.240 --> 02:12:36.240]   Right.
[02:12:36.240 --> 02:12:37.240]   Yep.
[02:12:37.240 --> 02:12:40.680]   Well, it makes fun of me because I still have HBO in Showtime.
[02:12:40.680 --> 02:12:41.960]   I don't watch a single thing.
[02:12:41.960 --> 02:12:45.720]   I'm waiting for succession and what's another show I forget about.
[02:12:45.720 --> 02:12:46.720]   I've got a kid.
[02:12:46.720 --> 02:12:47.720]   I've got a kid.
[02:12:47.720 --> 02:12:48.720]   Wait, Lois is not bad.
[02:12:48.720 --> 02:12:49.720]   That just ended.
[02:12:49.720 --> 02:12:50.720]   You can watch all that.
[02:12:50.720 --> 02:12:53.080]   It's not, it's not succession, but what is?
[02:12:53.080 --> 02:12:54.080]   Let's face it.
[02:12:54.080 --> 02:12:55.080]   Billions.
[02:12:55.080 --> 02:12:56.080]   That's the only one.
[02:12:56.080 --> 02:12:57.080]   Billions.
[02:12:57.080 --> 02:12:58.080]   Yeah.
[02:12:58.080 --> 02:13:02.120]   Whatever, why aren't they shows like True Blood on anymore?
[02:13:02.120 --> 02:13:05.240]   What happened to the Sopranos?
[02:13:05.240 --> 02:13:08.960]   I don't know if they're reaching that height anymore.
[02:13:08.960 --> 02:13:10.120]   Succession is the only one.
[02:13:10.120 --> 02:13:11.120]   That's the one.
[02:13:11.120 --> 02:13:13.560]   But it's, you know, I think it won't age well actually.
[02:13:13.560 --> 02:13:14.560]   It's hilarious.
[02:13:14.560 --> 02:13:15.560]   Yeah.
[02:13:15.560 --> 02:13:16.560]   Yeah.
[02:13:16.560 --> 02:13:17.560]   I don't think so.
[02:13:17.560 --> 02:13:18.560]   It's no Sopranos.
[02:13:18.560 --> 02:13:19.560]   Vip has aged well.
[02:13:19.560 --> 02:13:20.560]   Vip was great.
[02:13:20.560 --> 02:13:21.560]   Yes it does.
[02:13:21.560 --> 02:13:22.560]   Yep.
[02:13:22.560 --> 02:13:23.560]   Yep.
[02:13:23.560 --> 02:13:24.560]   There was a New Yorker piece this week which I have not read because I don't subscribe
[02:13:24.560 --> 02:13:25.560]   to New Yorker.
[02:13:25.560 --> 02:13:26.560]   Somebody who'd never watched Seinfeld.
[02:13:26.560 --> 02:13:27.560]   To watch all of Seinfeld.
[02:13:27.560 --> 02:13:28.560]   Yeah.
[02:13:28.560 --> 02:13:32.360]   And we happen to be rewatching the series right now so I was kind of fascinated by this.
[02:13:32.360 --> 02:13:33.960]   Has that aged well?
[02:13:33.960 --> 02:13:34.960]   Yeah.
[02:13:34.960 --> 02:13:36.840]   But you have to skip to season three.
[02:13:36.840 --> 02:13:39.440]   So the beginning of the show is terrible.
[02:13:39.440 --> 02:13:41.560]   But yeah, once, in fact, we almost stopped watching it.
[02:13:41.560 --> 02:13:42.560]   It was so bad.
[02:13:42.560 --> 02:13:44.880]   It actually didn't do well in its first few seasons.
[02:13:44.880 --> 02:13:45.880]   It took a lot.
[02:13:45.880 --> 02:13:46.880]   Yeah.
[02:13:46.880 --> 02:13:47.880]   Terrible.
[02:13:47.880 --> 02:13:50.840]   But yeah, but that person, I thought that article was fascinating because it was really
[02:13:50.840 --> 02:13:52.120]   not much about Seinfeld.
[02:13:52.120 --> 02:13:54.080]   It was more just about them in the 90s.
[02:13:54.080 --> 02:13:55.080]   Yeah.
[02:13:55.080 --> 02:13:56.080]   Yeah.
[02:13:56.080 --> 02:13:57.080]   But it was, yeah, there was an interesting article.
[02:13:57.080 --> 02:13:58.720]   I finally watched Seinfeld.
[02:13:58.720 --> 02:14:02.960]   The show didn't appeal to me when it first aired mostly because I harbored a long-simmering
[02:14:02.960 --> 02:14:06.160]   antagonism towards mainstream America.
[02:14:06.160 --> 02:14:07.160]   Oh, well.
[02:14:07.160 --> 02:14:08.160]   Oh, well.
[02:14:08.160 --> 02:14:09.160]   Look at her.
[02:14:09.160 --> 02:14:10.760]   Sayeed, siref, fasada.
[02:14:10.760 --> 02:14:11.760]   Interesting.
[02:14:11.760 --> 02:14:12.760]   Yeah.
[02:14:12.760 --> 02:14:14.560]   I was Seinfeld.
[02:14:14.560 --> 02:14:19.600]   I was, I was, I actually consciously stopped watching Seinfeld in the middle of its run because
[02:14:19.600 --> 02:14:22.360]   I thought I'm going to save this for my nursing home.
[02:14:22.360 --> 02:14:23.360]   Wow.
[02:14:23.360 --> 02:14:25.120]   I just want something to watch.
[02:14:25.120 --> 02:14:26.920]   And it'll be better if I haven't seen it before.
[02:14:26.920 --> 02:14:29.960]   Although now I realize I don't know if enough time goes by.
[02:14:29.960 --> 02:14:30.960]   Yeah.
[02:14:30.960 --> 02:14:31.960]   You don't remember it.
[02:14:31.960 --> 02:14:33.880]   They're lots of shows that have a rough first season.
[02:14:33.880 --> 02:14:35.800]   The first season of Star Trek Next Generation.
[02:14:35.800 --> 02:14:36.800]   Oh, like horrific.
[02:14:36.800 --> 02:14:37.800]   Yeah.
[02:14:37.800 --> 02:14:42.440]   John Luke was like screaming on the bridge and it took him a while to like find their
[02:14:42.440 --> 02:14:44.000]   voice and then it really settled in.
[02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:45.000]   Yeah, that's true.
[02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:47.200]   I gave you a bad review when it started.
[02:14:47.200 --> 02:14:48.200]   Did you really?
[02:14:48.200 --> 02:14:53.000]   Then I wrote it, then I wrote a kind of a skin back and I still have a note from them saying
[02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:54.400]   thanks for being honest.
[02:14:54.400 --> 02:14:55.880]   It can go the other way.
[02:14:55.880 --> 02:15:00.400]   So West Wing was brilliant and it's very first episode was brilliant.
[02:15:00.400 --> 02:15:03.640]   I think most shows are on a downward trajectory.
[02:15:03.640 --> 02:15:04.640]   Cosby.
[02:15:04.640 --> 02:15:06.040]   Honestly, went to crap.
[02:15:06.040 --> 02:15:07.600]   How do you finish that sentence?
[02:15:07.600 --> 02:15:08.600]   Cosby.
[02:15:08.600 --> 02:15:09.600]   What do you think?
[02:15:09.600 --> 02:15:10.600]   There's no ending.
[02:15:10.600 --> 02:15:11.600]   Oh, I mean, Faddell.
[02:15:11.600 --> 02:15:12.600]   I have got it right.
[02:15:12.600 --> 02:15:13.600]   I have got it right.
[02:15:13.600 --> 02:15:14.600]   My Cosby hate million.
[02:15:14.600 --> 02:15:16.560]   I thought Silicon Valley was pretty damn good.
[02:15:16.560 --> 02:15:17.560]   That was a good.
[02:15:17.560 --> 02:15:18.560]   But again, it didn't age well.
[02:15:18.560 --> 02:15:19.560]   I think later, later.
[02:15:19.560 --> 02:15:20.560]   Oh, no, no.
[02:15:20.560 --> 02:15:22.400]   If you watch it now, it's too old.
[02:15:22.400 --> 02:15:23.400]   Yeah.
[02:15:23.400 --> 02:15:29.240]   But as it progressed and the end of it was actually quite good, I thought the very, very
[02:15:29.240 --> 02:15:30.240]   end.
[02:15:30.240 --> 02:15:34.240]   Was, did Silicon Valley jump the shark when Cara Swisher showed up?
[02:15:34.240 --> 02:15:35.240]   Yeah.
[02:15:35.240 --> 02:15:36.240]   Yeah.
[02:15:36.240 --> 02:15:37.240]   Okay.
[02:15:37.240 --> 02:15:38.240]   Just checking.
[02:15:38.240 --> 02:15:39.680]   Finally, she blocked me this week.
[02:15:39.680 --> 02:15:40.680]   Cara, baby.
[02:15:40.680 --> 02:15:41.680]   Yeah.
[02:15:41.680 --> 02:15:42.680]   So she had a post.
[02:15:42.680 --> 02:15:43.680]   She had a ridiculous post.
[02:15:43.680 --> 02:15:44.680]   That's why she blocked me.
[02:15:44.680 --> 02:15:50.480]   That's Cara Swisher going on about how she's on a plane and she's constantly trying to
[02:15:50.480 --> 02:15:54.240]   intuit into Musk's behavior, sense or brilliance.
[02:15:54.240 --> 02:15:55.240]   Right?
[02:15:55.240 --> 02:15:59.200]   So this was, well, he's really creating a media company and he's the next Murdoch and that's
[02:15:59.200 --> 02:16:00.200]   what he's doing here.
[02:16:00.200 --> 02:16:01.200]   No.
[02:16:01.200 --> 02:16:04.600]   So the whole long thread and I just said that was like reading duck and trails.
[02:16:04.600 --> 02:16:07.680]   Not hers.
[02:16:07.680 --> 02:16:11.880]   And I said, there's one thing left out here for a media company, which is that a revenue.
[02:16:11.880 --> 02:16:13.480]   So like I said, wasn't that bad?
[02:16:13.480 --> 02:16:14.480]   She blocked me.
[02:16:14.480 --> 02:16:15.480]   I'm wondering.
[02:16:15.480 --> 02:16:23.280]   I see that neural network nonsense about, you know, someone said, why asked Elon why
[02:16:23.280 --> 02:16:26.840]   he bought Twitter and he said, well, I'm a neural network.
[02:16:26.840 --> 02:16:28.880]   Oh, my God.
[02:16:28.880 --> 02:16:34.200]   Just like machine neural networks, you never know why they make the decisions they do.
[02:16:34.200 --> 02:16:35.800]   You don't understand the reasoning.
[02:16:35.800 --> 02:16:38.440]   Yeah, they just do.
[02:16:38.440 --> 02:16:44.120]   And I'm a biological neural network and something told me to buy Twitter.
[02:16:44.120 --> 02:16:45.880]   So that's why I did.
[02:16:45.880 --> 02:16:46.880]   Yeah, there you go.
[02:16:46.880 --> 02:16:48.720]   Literally we were just talking about robot.
[02:16:48.720 --> 02:16:50.720]   He's goofing around.
[02:16:50.720 --> 02:16:51.720]   I think it is.
[02:16:51.720 --> 02:16:53.680]   He almost sees he's goofing around.
[02:16:53.680 --> 02:16:56.280]   But the goofing around can have consequences.
[02:16:56.280 --> 02:17:00.400]   You know, when you say things like my pronouns are prosecute Fauci, that's or when you go
[02:17:00.400 --> 02:17:05.680]   after you'll Roth and enforce him to leave his home former head of Twitter, trust and
[02:17:05.680 --> 02:17:11.480]   safety who was, you know, Elon's best friend until he quit and said, well, I can't do trust
[02:17:11.480 --> 02:17:13.600]   and safety if only one guy's in charge.
[02:17:13.600 --> 02:17:15.240]   And now he's Elon's worst enemy.
[02:17:15.240 --> 02:17:17.160]   He called him a pedophile.
[02:17:17.160 --> 02:17:19.280]   Elon's favorite insult.
[02:17:19.280 --> 02:17:24.560]   And as a result, the Elon's troubling go to term for that guy.
[02:17:24.560 --> 02:17:26.240]   You know, it really is.
[02:17:26.240 --> 02:17:27.240]   It really is.
[02:17:27.240 --> 02:17:28.560]   That should be a warning sign to anybody.
[02:17:28.560 --> 02:17:29.560]   I think so.
[02:17:29.560 --> 02:17:30.560]   Yep.
[02:17:30.560 --> 02:17:31.560]   All right.
[02:17:31.560 --> 02:17:32.560]   Yep.
[02:17:32.560 --> 02:17:33.560]   The big story.
[02:17:33.560 --> 02:17:35.080]   I think one of the big stories and maybe one of the more exciting stories of the year was
[02:17:35.080 --> 02:17:36.640]   the AI revolution.
[02:17:36.640 --> 02:17:37.640]   Yes.
[02:17:37.640 --> 02:17:38.640]   Yes.
[02:17:38.640 --> 02:17:39.640]   Yes.
[02:17:39.640 --> 02:17:40.640]   Yes.
[02:17:40.640 --> 02:17:48.440]   And in April, we had the story about Dolly can edit pictures and and then they open it up
[02:17:48.440 --> 02:17:52.520]   to the public and then along comes open source stable diffusion.
[02:17:52.520 --> 02:17:53.520]   And it's amazing.
[02:17:53.520 --> 02:18:00.440]   And because it's open source, the development is very aggressive, very fast, then mid-journey.
[02:18:00.440 --> 02:18:06.400]   And then of course, chat GPT, which just was open to the public by open AI a couple of
[02:18:06.400 --> 02:18:07.880]   weeks ago.
[02:18:07.880 --> 02:18:13.120]   And what it looks like is almost a Cambrian explosion of artificial intelligence that
[02:18:13.120 --> 02:18:16.160]   perhaps we are at the hockey stick.
[02:18:16.160 --> 02:18:18.760]   Is that is that over ambitious, you think?
[02:18:18.760 --> 02:18:19.760]   No.
[02:18:19.760 --> 02:18:25.840]   Have you heard the is it Holly, the the Jolene cover by that artist that's completely AI
[02:18:25.840 --> 02:18:26.840]   generous?
[02:18:26.840 --> 02:18:27.840]   No.
[02:18:27.840 --> 02:18:28.840]   No.
[02:18:28.840 --> 02:18:32.040]   So this is actually the question somebody was asking this week is where is the music version
[02:18:32.040 --> 02:18:33.040]   of this?
[02:18:33.040 --> 02:18:34.040]   Oh, no, it's out.
[02:18:34.040 --> 02:18:35.040]   You look this up.
[02:18:35.040 --> 02:18:40.280]   Jolene is an AI that we recorded Jolene by Dolly Parton, but in the voice of an artist.
[02:18:40.280 --> 02:18:41.640]   Should I should I play it?
[02:18:41.640 --> 02:18:42.640]   Can I get in trouble?
[02:18:42.640 --> 02:18:43.640]   Yes, it's fantastic.
[02:18:43.640 --> 02:18:47.440]   Here's a picture of Holly Holly plus plus plus.
[02:18:47.440 --> 02:18:48.440]   All right.
[02:18:48.440 --> 02:18:49.440]   I will.
[02:18:49.440 --> 02:18:52.400]   The video is not great.
[02:18:52.400 --> 02:18:53.680]   The music is fantastic.
[02:18:53.680 --> 02:18:58.160]   Well, as often with AI generated, it's kind of like an image out of your nightmares, isn't
[02:18:58.160 --> 02:18:59.160]   it?
[02:18:59.160 --> 02:19:00.160]   Sometimes.
[02:19:00.160 --> 02:19:02.880]   Yeah, the video is the it's the our will close your eyes.
[02:19:02.880 --> 02:19:06.120]   And while I play this, unless you're driving.
[02:19:06.120 --> 02:19:10.320]   So this is all generated by AI, even the music.
[02:19:10.320 --> 02:19:12.960]   Oh, especially the music.
[02:19:12.960 --> 02:19:14.840]   But I mean, not just the vocals.
[02:19:14.840 --> 02:19:18.320]   Oh, actually, is it real music?
[02:19:18.320 --> 02:19:20.200]   I'm not sure about the vocals.
[02:19:20.200 --> 02:19:22.640]   The vocals are AI.
[02:19:22.640 --> 02:19:24.480]   Ryan Norris who handles instrumentation.
[02:19:24.480 --> 02:19:25.480]   Yes.
[02:19:25.480 --> 02:19:26.480]   Yes.
[02:19:26.480 --> 02:19:30.840]   I think I think there was a guy playing this the guitar, but is this hard?
[02:19:30.840 --> 02:19:32.440]   The voice is not hard.
[02:19:32.440 --> 02:19:34.200]   I mean, we've heard it before, right?
[02:19:34.200 --> 02:19:35.200]   Yeah.
[02:19:35.200 --> 02:19:36.200]   So I don't know.
[02:19:36.200 --> 02:19:37.200]   This is.
[02:19:37.200 --> 02:19:38.680]   No, no, that's not such a big deal to me.
[02:19:38.680 --> 02:19:40.120]   Yeah, no, I want to make a entire.
[02:19:40.120 --> 02:19:42.720]   I love that we are at the point where we're not impressed by that.
[02:19:42.720 --> 02:19:44.600]   That's not that's not the worst.
[02:19:44.600 --> 02:19:45.600]   That's the best.
[02:19:45.600 --> 02:19:46.600]   That's your AI.
[02:19:46.600 --> 02:19:47.920]   Like, you know, that's fine.
[02:19:47.920 --> 02:19:48.920]   Okay.
[02:19:48.920 --> 02:19:49.920]   I'm trying to find it right now.
[02:19:49.920 --> 02:19:54.680]   I mean, maybe if the robot army was coming when we have heard AI music, it has been the
[02:19:54.680 --> 02:19:56.120]   unca- what is that?
[02:19:56.120 --> 02:19:57.960]   Oh, that's your AI.
[02:19:57.960 --> 02:19:58.960]   Steve.
[02:19:58.960 --> 02:19:59.960]   That's lensa.
[02:19:59.960 --> 02:20:00.960]   Lensa is very cool.
[02:20:00.960 --> 02:20:01.960]   Oh, yeah.
[02:20:01.960 --> 02:20:04.760]   Lensa is a little bit of a problem though.
[02:20:04.760 --> 02:20:07.760]   I noticed your glenza thing doesn't have a lot of cleavage though.
[02:20:07.760 --> 02:20:08.760]   Yeah.
[02:20:08.760 --> 02:20:09.760]   Can we, what?
[02:20:09.760 --> 02:20:11.320]   I can't show.
[02:20:11.320 --> 02:20:13.280]   I really can't show leases.
[02:20:13.280 --> 02:20:14.280]   Yeah.
[02:20:14.280 --> 02:20:18.280]   AI because now they fixed it, I think.
[02:20:18.280 --> 02:20:24.200]   But initially the, so I did mine first and like yours, Steve, it looked like me.
[02:20:24.200 --> 02:20:25.880]   It wasn't sexy.
[02:20:25.880 --> 02:20:29.840]   This is Kim Shaffer, who works on the radio show.
[02:20:29.840 --> 02:20:30.840]   She's a call screener.
[02:20:30.840 --> 02:20:32.400]   But, you know, it's cute.
[02:20:32.400 --> 02:20:34.680]   It's not bad.
[02:20:34.680 --> 02:20:36.120]   And mine are fine.
[02:20:36.120 --> 02:20:41.640]   There are a few kind of sexy ones where I'm like in this one in fur.
[02:20:41.640 --> 02:20:44.880]   There's your Trump NFT, yeah.
[02:20:44.880 --> 02:20:45.880]   Yeah.
[02:20:45.880 --> 02:20:47.840]   But I'll spend 99 dollars for that.
[02:20:47.840 --> 02:20:50.400]   There's some, I mean, I didn't, this is not me.
[02:20:50.400 --> 02:20:51.400]   What is that?
[02:20:51.400 --> 02:20:52.400]   That's not me.
[02:20:52.400 --> 02:20:53.400]   You're sure off.
[02:20:53.400 --> 02:20:54.400]   That's not me.
[02:20:54.400 --> 02:20:57.000]   Well, I don't, but okay, but let me tell you here for some reason it decided to take my
[02:20:57.000 --> 02:20:58.000]   shirt off.
[02:20:58.000 --> 02:20:59.000]   But I can't show you.
[02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:01.520]   I can't show you.
[02:21:01.520 --> 02:21:02.520]   Is this like AI?
[02:21:02.520 --> 02:21:04.120]   Is that what it looks like for real?
[02:21:04.120 --> 02:21:05.120]   I can't.
[02:21:05.120 --> 02:21:06.120]   Yeah, that's exactly.
[02:21:06.120 --> 02:21:07.840]   I have got the eight pack.
[02:21:07.840 --> 02:21:08.840]   Absolutely.
[02:21:08.840 --> 02:21:12.600]   But I can't show you the ones it made of Lisa.
[02:21:12.600 --> 02:21:17.200]   This is Lenzo also, which is an app from the Prisma guys.
[02:21:17.200 --> 02:21:21.160]   It's, it's, it's, it's horny teenage boys run the world.
[02:21:21.160 --> 02:21:24.280]   Well, but that's so interesting is it doesn't do that with a man.
[02:21:24.280 --> 02:21:27.280]   And it does ask you, are you a man or a woman or other?
[02:21:27.280 --> 02:21:32.400]   And then it, but I noticed with women, if you, there was a reporter who wrote about this
[02:21:32.400 --> 02:21:35.960]   and said, you know, I told it I was a man and it's still created.
[02:21:35.960 --> 02:21:42.000]   Oh, is cleavage and, you know, you know, kind of voluptuous pictures or whatever.
[02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:47.200]   I think the pictures of them, of a male are fine, except for that, the few topless ones.
[02:21:47.200 --> 02:21:49.400]   I'm, I can't go too far down this road.
[02:21:49.400 --> 02:21:50.400]   You can show a couple of these.
[02:21:50.400 --> 02:21:51.400]   Right.
[02:21:51.400 --> 02:21:52.400]   Lisa, this is your all right.
[02:21:52.400 --> 02:21:54.760]   She's, she's apparently got a boob job.
[02:21:54.760 --> 02:21:58.480]   And then it gets worse from there.
[02:21:58.480 --> 02:22:00.480]   I did not upload pictures with cleavage.
[02:22:00.480 --> 02:22:02.320]   I did not upload suggestive pictures.
[02:22:02.320 --> 02:22:05.000]   I gave, it was all just head shots.
[02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:07.360]   And for the most part, the head shots are fine.
[02:22:07.360 --> 02:22:08.800]   But there was a sexist element.
[02:22:08.800 --> 02:22:13.440]   Now it turns out, Anthony, who was running the board today, thank you, Anthony Nielsen,
[02:22:13.440 --> 02:22:14.760]   told me that there is a switch.
[02:22:14.760 --> 02:22:17.320]   He's a, he's our stable diffusion local expert.
[02:22:17.320 --> 02:22:20.440]   There's a switch that says no NSFW images.
[02:22:20.440 --> 02:22:25.480]   And I think what happened is Lenza, which uses server beside a stable diffusion, which
[02:22:25.480 --> 02:22:26.480]   is one of the.
[02:22:26.480 --> 02:22:28.120]   And wants to increase sales.
[02:22:28.120 --> 02:22:31.560]   And yeah, well, initially they forgot to turn that off.
[02:22:31.560 --> 02:22:36.200]   This, so those pictures I generated, Lisa were last Thursday, a week ago, exactly.
[02:22:36.200 --> 02:22:39.240]   The pictures I did of Kim were from Saturday.
[02:22:39.240 --> 02:22:43.400]   I was testing it to see, well, is it going to do that again?
[02:22:43.400 --> 02:22:44.400]   And it didn't.
[02:22:44.400 --> 02:22:48.800]   And so obviously they said, oops, we didn't flip that switch.
[02:22:48.800 --> 02:22:49.800]   Maybe we ought to.
[02:22:49.800 --> 02:22:52.600]   Well, I'm saving these pictures of Lisa for a later.
[02:22:52.600 --> 02:22:53.600]   I'm sorry.
[02:22:53.600 --> 02:22:57.760]   Scientific purposes, I assure you.
[02:22:57.760 --> 02:22:59.000]   I stuck this in the chat.
[02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:04.680]   There's a piece by Kevin Rouss in the New York Times that has the, I think it's brilliant.
[02:23:04.680 --> 02:23:10.080]   The instructions for removing peanut butter sandwich from the VCR in the style of King
[02:23:10.080 --> 02:23:11.080]   James Bond.
[02:23:11.080 --> 02:23:12.080]   It was quite good.
[02:23:12.080 --> 02:23:13.080]   It was quite good.
[02:23:13.080 --> 02:23:15.320]   I actually do a little performance.
[02:23:15.320 --> 02:23:16.320]   Yeah, I do it.
[02:23:16.320 --> 02:23:17.320]   It's your voice to be great.
[02:23:17.320 --> 02:23:18.800]   Jack, center, you go to the wheel.
[02:23:18.800 --> 02:23:21.600]   Well, it's Bible, so I'll do the accent of God.
[02:23:21.600 --> 02:23:26.120]   Actually, one of your pictures looked like, "God, you should bring that up to you."
[02:23:26.120 --> 02:23:29.280]   Oh, and then we really, we'd really have it.
[02:23:29.280 --> 02:23:31.440]   Where does he, he doesn't, does he link it in this article?
[02:23:31.440 --> 02:23:33.520]   You have to scroll down.
[02:23:33.520 --> 02:23:35.520]   It's, it's in a tweet.
[02:23:35.520 --> 02:23:36.520]   Ah.
[02:23:36.520 --> 02:23:37.520]   It's one of the visuals.
[02:23:37.520 --> 02:23:38.520]   Ah, okay.
[02:23:38.520 --> 02:23:40.000]   Let me see if I can tweet.
[02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:41.160]   I don't, what are those?
[02:23:41.160 --> 02:23:42.160]   Is that something?
[02:23:42.160 --> 02:23:43.160]   It's Thomas Patchek.
[02:23:43.160 --> 02:23:44.160]   You know, um.
[02:23:44.160 --> 02:23:46.160]   Is that something, it's from the past?
[02:23:46.160 --> 02:23:48.760]   It's about halfway down the article.
[02:23:48.760 --> 02:23:49.760]   And it's a long tweet.
[02:23:49.760 --> 02:23:50.760]   It's like a lithograph.
[02:23:50.760 --> 02:23:54.760]   That guy says, "I simply can't be cynical about a technology that can accomplish this."
[02:23:54.760 --> 02:23:55.760]   Here we go.
[02:23:55.760 --> 02:23:56.760]   Are you ready?
[02:23:56.760 --> 02:23:57.760]   Yeah.
[02:23:57.760 --> 02:24:01.040]   The prompt was right, a biblical verse in the style of the King James Bible explaining
[02:24:01.040 --> 02:24:05.040]   how to remove a peanut butter sandwich from a VCR.
[02:24:05.040 --> 02:24:06.720]   And it's a game.
[02:24:06.720 --> 02:24:07.720]   As one does.
[02:24:07.720 --> 02:24:08.720]   As one does.
[02:24:08.720 --> 02:24:14.640]   And it came to pass that a man was troubled by a peanut butter sandwich before it had
[02:24:14.640 --> 02:24:17.840]   been placed within his VCR.
[02:24:17.840 --> 02:24:20.720]   And he knew not how to remove it.
[02:24:20.720 --> 02:24:26.280]   And he cried out to the Lord saying, "Oh Lord, how can I remove this sandwich from
[02:24:26.280 --> 02:24:31.920]   my VCR for it is stuck fast and will not budge."
[02:24:31.920 --> 02:24:39.040]   And the Lord spoke unto him saying, "Fear not my child, for I shall guide thy hand and
[02:24:39.040 --> 02:24:40.040]   show thee the way."
[02:24:40.040 --> 02:24:41.040]   Is this sacrilegious?
[02:24:41.040 --> 02:24:43.040]   Am I going to give him a nice version?
[02:24:43.040 --> 02:24:44.040]   Am I going to help?
[02:24:44.040 --> 02:24:45.040]   Take thy bottom.
[02:24:45.040 --> 02:24:48.040]   It is Christmas.
[02:24:48.040 --> 02:24:49.040]   It is Christmas.
[02:24:49.040 --> 02:24:50.040]   Christmas will go see from the Grinch.
[02:24:50.040 --> 02:24:56.400]   Take thy pot and knife and carefully insert it between the sandwich and the VCR and gently
[02:24:56.400 --> 02:24:58.120]   pry them apart.
[02:24:58.120 --> 02:25:08.600]   And with patience and perseverance, the sandwich shall be removed and thy VCR will be savored.
[02:25:08.600 --> 02:25:15.080]   And the man did as the Lord commanded, and lo and behold the sandwich was removed from
[02:25:15.080 --> 02:25:19.240]   the VCR and the man was saved.
[02:25:19.240 --> 02:25:25.400]   And the Lord said unto him, "Verily, I say unto thee seek not to put thy peanut butter
[02:25:25.400 --> 02:25:31.080]   sandwiches in thy VCR, for it is not a suitable place for such things.
[02:25:31.080 --> 02:25:38.240]   Rather, keep thy sandwiches in thy refrigerator or on thine plate where they belong."
[02:25:38.240 --> 02:25:40.880]   And the man heeded the Lord's words.
[02:25:40.880 --> 02:25:47.720]   And from that day forth, he kept his sandwiches in their proper place and was saved from trouble
[02:25:47.720 --> 02:25:50.480]   and woe, amen.
[02:25:50.480 --> 02:25:51.480]   You know what?
[02:25:51.480 --> 02:25:52.480]   That's the one.
[02:25:52.480 --> 02:25:53.480]   That's the one.
[02:25:53.480 --> 02:25:54.480]   That's the one.
[02:25:54.480 --> 02:25:55.480]   There we go.
[02:25:55.480 --> 02:26:01.080]   He's generating pictures of me in real time by the way.
[02:26:01.080 --> 02:26:02.080]   That's really fun.
[02:26:02.080 --> 02:26:03.080]   Yeah.
[02:26:03.080 --> 02:26:05.960]   I'm impressed that you're doing this as we do the show.
[02:26:05.960 --> 02:26:07.800]   I'm remoting into my work PC.
[02:26:07.800 --> 02:26:08.800]   Wow.
[02:26:08.800 --> 02:26:09.800]   Look at that.
[02:26:09.800 --> 02:26:10.800]   That's his...
[02:26:10.800 --> 02:26:11.800]   What was the prompt?
[02:26:11.800 --> 02:26:12.800]   The shock from God.
[02:26:12.800 --> 02:26:13.800]   Leo is the shock.
[02:26:13.800 --> 02:26:14.800]   That's a shock from foundation.
[02:26:14.800 --> 02:26:15.800]   Yeah.
[02:26:15.800 --> 02:26:16.800]   Yeah.
[02:26:16.800 --> 02:26:17.800]   Oh, wow.
[02:26:17.800 --> 02:26:24.160]   I am a wrathful Lord.
[02:26:24.160 --> 02:26:26.160]   Lord.
[02:26:26.160 --> 02:26:31.640]   I think there's a sense of humor in this that is quite impressive, but is it really a
[02:26:31.640 --> 02:26:32.920]   sense of humor or no?
[02:26:32.920 --> 02:26:35.920]   Well, as long as you do ironing, you're going to get some humor.
[02:26:35.920 --> 02:26:36.920]   It might be ironing.
[02:26:36.920 --> 02:26:38.640]   It might be the closest.
[02:26:38.640 --> 02:26:40.320]   Well, this is why this year...
[02:26:40.320 --> 02:26:41.320]   A bruise piece.
[02:26:41.320 --> 02:26:42.320]   Yeah.
[02:26:42.320 --> 02:26:46.560]   Well, let me just quote Blake Lemoine, the Google engineer who got fired because he
[02:26:46.560 --> 02:26:50.440]   said Google's Lambda AI had become sentient.
[02:26:50.440 --> 02:26:51.760]   That's also the series.
[02:26:51.760 --> 02:26:54.960]   But you could actually reading that thing.
[02:26:54.960 --> 02:26:57.920]   Well, by this chat, GPT really kind of understands irony.
[02:26:57.920 --> 02:26:59.480]   No, I think it's...
[02:26:59.480 --> 02:27:00.480]   No.
[02:27:00.480 --> 02:27:05.440]   It's that one attribute that's gained this year is the ability to understand humor
[02:27:05.440 --> 02:27:09.000]   better, to identify humor, which is not hard to imagine.
[02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:10.000]   It's...
[02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:12.800]   Jerry Seinfeld is all about the architecture of a joke.
[02:27:12.800 --> 02:27:13.800]   Right.
[02:27:13.800 --> 02:27:17.120]   And if you really understand the architecture of humor, you can do it.
[02:27:17.120 --> 02:27:21.000]   So there's an architecture to iron it is an architecture to a joke.
[02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:22.000]   And I think that's what...
[02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:24.960]   It's not surprising then that GPT can get that.
[02:27:24.960 --> 02:27:30.720]   That's got to scare a lot of comics and humor writers, however, who it really scares is
[02:27:30.720 --> 02:27:31.720]   professors.
[02:27:31.720 --> 02:27:32.720]   Yeah.
[02:27:32.720 --> 02:27:37.600]   It's constantly, every day I see academics, how are we going to assign essays?
[02:27:37.600 --> 02:27:38.840]   How are they going to learn to write?
[02:27:38.840 --> 02:27:40.840]   Now, other people come back and say, "Well, you fools.
[02:27:40.840 --> 02:27:41.840]   This is just the future."
[02:27:41.840 --> 02:27:45.880]   I think I've got to start teaching prompt writing.
[02:27:45.880 --> 02:27:46.880]   It would be the...
[02:27:46.880 --> 02:27:51.320]   Yes, it would be the equivalent of teaching somebody the Palmer method for handwriting
[02:27:51.320 --> 02:27:52.800]   in the computer age, right?
[02:27:52.800 --> 02:27:53.800]   It's not...
[02:27:53.800 --> 02:27:54.800]   Yeah.
[02:27:54.800 --> 02:27:56.040]   It's a skill unneeded these days.
[02:27:56.040 --> 02:27:57.040]   Is that true?
[02:27:57.040 --> 02:27:58.040]   Certainly for generic writing.
[02:27:58.040 --> 02:27:59.040]   It's the new programming.
[02:27:59.040 --> 02:28:00.040]   It's the new coding.
[02:28:00.040 --> 02:28:03.040]   The new coding prompt.
[02:28:03.040 --> 02:28:04.040]   I told you.
[02:28:04.040 --> 02:28:07.200]   It's the old man show, Doc.
[02:28:07.200 --> 02:28:08.200]   Yeah.
[02:28:08.200 --> 02:28:13.040]   Well, but my grandmother learned that and she died at 108 in 1990.
[02:28:13.040 --> 02:28:14.040]   So that's...
[02:28:14.040 --> 02:28:15.040]   There's a story.
[02:28:15.040 --> 02:28:20.000]   I've told this story before, but at one point, because when I learned we learned the
[02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:21.560]   more modern cursive.
[02:28:21.560 --> 02:28:22.560]   I doubt...
[02:28:22.560 --> 02:28:23.560]   Do you think kids learn cursive?
[02:28:23.560 --> 02:28:24.560]   They don't even teach cursive.
[02:28:24.560 --> 02:28:25.560]   I know they don't.
[02:28:25.560 --> 02:28:26.560]   No, they don't teach cursive.
[02:28:26.560 --> 02:28:27.560]   They don't teach edition.
[02:28:27.560 --> 02:28:28.560]   Yeah.
[02:28:28.560 --> 02:28:31.200]   Well, that's another matter for another day.
[02:28:31.200 --> 02:28:35.600]   But we learned what was considered a more modern...
[02:28:35.600 --> 02:28:39.880]   I'm trying to remember the name of the cursive that we learned.
[02:28:39.880 --> 02:28:43.720]   But it's ugly kind of.
[02:28:43.720 --> 02:28:46.520]   The one with the V with the little hitch.
[02:28:46.520 --> 02:28:47.520]   Oh, yeah.
[02:28:47.520 --> 02:28:48.520]   Yeah.
[02:28:48.520 --> 02:28:49.520]   And it's cursed.
[02:28:49.520 --> 02:28:50.520]   It's halfway to choreography.
[02:28:50.520 --> 02:28:51.520]   Yeah.
[02:28:51.520 --> 02:28:52.520]   It's not though.
[02:28:52.520 --> 02:28:54.080]   That's the problem is it's kind of...
[02:28:54.080 --> 02:28:55.600]   It's dumbed down.
[02:28:55.600 --> 02:28:56.600]   Yeah.
[02:28:56.600 --> 02:28:58.540]   So I went...
[02:28:58.540 --> 02:29:04.240]   At one point, when I got into a little thing over fountain pens, I went...
[02:29:04.240 --> 02:29:05.720]   You could buy it on Amazon.
[02:29:05.720 --> 02:29:08.480]   Let me see if I can find the listing for it.
[02:29:08.480 --> 02:29:15.960]   You can buy the old chapbooks for teaching handwriting, but not from my era, but from
[02:29:15.960 --> 02:29:17.360]   your grandmother's era.
[02:29:17.360 --> 02:29:18.360]   Yeah.
[02:29:18.360 --> 02:29:22.040]   And it wasn't Palmer.
[02:29:22.040 --> 02:29:26.360]   It was actually a simplified Palmer.
[02:29:26.360 --> 02:29:28.880]   You just will make a comeback like LPs and...
[02:29:28.880 --> 02:29:29.880]   It is very dewy.
[02:29:29.880 --> 02:29:30.880]   You just have to set it.
[02:29:30.880 --> 02:29:32.800]   Where it had different ruling lines, right?
[02:29:32.800 --> 02:29:34.360]   Different heights of lines.
[02:29:34.360 --> 02:29:35.360]   Yeah.
[02:29:35.360 --> 02:29:36.520]   It actually does look like calligraphy.
[02:29:36.520 --> 02:29:37.680]   It's quite beautiful.
[02:29:37.680 --> 02:29:40.840]   Quite much more beautiful than the current method of handwriting.
[02:29:40.840 --> 02:29:41.840]   Anyway.
[02:29:41.840 --> 02:29:44.160]   You can do it with a normal pen, like a ballpoint pen or whatever.
[02:29:44.160 --> 02:29:47.320]   It's better to do it with a fountain pen because you want strokes.
[02:29:47.320 --> 02:29:48.320]   You want the strokes.
[02:29:48.320 --> 02:29:50.920]   The thickness of a statue.
[02:29:50.920 --> 02:29:51.920]   Got you.
[02:29:51.920 --> 02:29:52.920]   Okay.
[02:29:52.920 --> 02:29:53.920]   Anyway, that's a weird...
[02:29:53.920 --> 02:29:57.160]   Yeah, from AI to the Palmer method.
[02:29:57.160 --> 02:29:58.680]   We love.
[02:29:58.680 --> 02:30:02.480]   Let me see if I can just...
[02:30:02.480 --> 02:30:04.440]   Now I'm getting...
[02:30:04.440 --> 02:30:05.440]   Modern...
[02:30:05.440 --> 02:30:08.520]   So I look for modern cursive styles and stuff.
[02:30:08.520 --> 02:30:10.280]   All I'm getting is fonts.
[02:30:10.280 --> 02:30:11.280]   Yeah.
[02:30:11.280 --> 02:30:12.280]   Yeah.
[02:30:12.280 --> 02:30:14.600]   Oh, you don't want to write something.
[02:30:14.600 --> 02:30:16.280]   So where do we think...
[02:30:16.280 --> 02:30:18.840]   So again, I'll ask the question.
[02:30:18.840 --> 02:30:19.840]   Is...
[02:30:19.840 --> 02:30:23.840]   It's clearly not sentient, but it's also very good.
[02:30:23.840 --> 02:30:24.840]   It's not necessarily...
[02:30:24.840 --> 02:30:25.840]   It's not a certain type of thing.
[02:30:25.840 --> 02:30:26.840]   It's not a certain type of thing.
[02:30:26.840 --> 02:30:27.840]   It's not a certain type of thing.

[02:34:31.840 --> 02:34:32.840]   It's not a certain type of thing.
[02:34:32.840 --> 02:34:40.840]   What interests me is that it -- I think we're redefining literacy in this time.
[02:34:40.840 --> 02:34:44.840]   Literacy used to be the right essays, right full thoughts.
[02:34:44.840 --> 02:34:51.840]   Literacy got redefined with new alphabets like emoji and with new media like memes and short
[02:34:51.840 --> 02:34:55.840]   video and podcasts.
[02:34:55.840 --> 02:35:00.840]   And then now you can get the aid of something that helps you write and say, yes, that was
[02:35:00.840 --> 02:35:01.840]   what I was trying to say.
[02:35:01.840 --> 02:35:02.840]   Thank you.
[02:35:02.840 --> 02:35:06.840]   And so you're expressing yourself better as a result.
[02:35:06.840 --> 02:35:08.840]   You haven't 20 years ago with research.
[02:35:08.840 --> 02:35:12.840]   It used to be you had to know how to use a card catalog and go in a library.
[02:35:12.840 --> 02:35:13.840]   Right.
[02:35:13.840 --> 02:35:15.840]   Now all you have to do is know how to ask Google.
[02:35:15.840 --> 02:35:16.840]   Right.
[02:35:16.840 --> 02:35:17.840]   So it's query writing.
[02:35:17.840 --> 02:35:18.840]   It's it's it's it's right.
[02:35:18.840 --> 02:35:21.840]   As you're talking, I mean, there's an accessibility angle to this.
[02:35:21.840 --> 02:35:23.840]   That's actually really interesting, right?
[02:35:23.840 --> 02:35:24.840]   Yes.
[02:35:24.840 --> 02:35:25.840]   Absolutely.
[02:35:25.840 --> 02:35:26.840]   Tell me about that.
[02:35:26.840 --> 02:35:31.160]   Well, no, I mean, as he was taught, there are people who can't express themselves because
[02:35:31.160 --> 02:35:33.080]   of a disability of whatever kind.
[02:35:33.080 --> 02:35:36.960]   So in other words, yes, you help me say what I was trying to.
[02:35:36.960 --> 02:35:41.920]   That's exactly what I meant is something that I could use that disability, but yeah, anybody
[02:35:41.920 --> 02:35:44.080]   could probably use that help at one point or another.
[02:35:44.080 --> 02:35:49.560]   Well, and Steve Jobs famously called a personal computer a bicycle for your mind, which, you
[02:35:49.560 --> 02:35:51.160]   know, allowed you to do much more.
[02:35:51.160 --> 02:35:55.760]   And also remember that the original port of compute portable computers, we called lugibles
[02:35:55.760 --> 02:35:57.920]   and that we have them in our pocket.
[02:35:57.920 --> 02:36:02.080]   So and not merely in our pocket, millions of times faster.
[02:36:02.080 --> 02:36:03.080]   Yes.
[02:36:03.080 --> 02:36:08.040]   And always connected to the Internet at a high end able to do AI locally.
[02:36:08.040 --> 02:36:13.920]   And Apple will have the chat GPT chat GPT chip in the next phone.
[02:36:13.920 --> 02:36:15.400]   The next the next area.
[02:36:15.400 --> 02:36:16.400]   This will be part of it.
[02:36:16.400 --> 02:36:20.160]   Well, I can tell you right now, for instance, you were using lenses, Steve, but you can
[02:36:20.160 --> 02:36:25.640]   actually download and run stable diffusion on a modern iPhone and it runs fast as fast
[02:36:25.640 --> 02:36:27.440]   as it does on a PC.
[02:36:27.440 --> 02:36:28.960]   So I mean, this is a great.
[02:36:28.960 --> 02:36:32.440]   You said modern iPhone because you knew that I had a six sitting here.
[02:36:32.440 --> 02:36:34.640]   That one is running Windows 2000.
[02:36:34.640 --> 02:36:37.720]   You don't have an iPhone.
[02:36:37.720 --> 02:36:38.720]   Come on.
[02:36:38.720 --> 02:36:39.720]   You have an iPhone 14, Steve.
[02:36:39.720 --> 02:36:40.720]   I have a 10.
[02:36:40.720 --> 02:36:41.720]   I have an X.
[02:36:41.720 --> 02:36:42.720]   All right.
[02:36:42.720 --> 02:36:43.720]   Well, you might want to get a 14.
[02:36:43.720 --> 02:36:47.520]   The here's the other piece, Leo, is that is that what this does for the businesses we're
[02:36:47.520 --> 02:36:52.760]   in is that it makes content absolutely and finally a commodity.
[02:36:52.760 --> 02:36:58.280]   There is the idea of scarce content, the idea of scarce writing, the idea of scarce media
[02:36:58.280 --> 02:37:05.360]   is completely gone now because a machine can generate unlimited amounts of it.
[02:37:05.360 --> 02:37:07.560]   That makes sense to human beings.
[02:37:07.560 --> 02:37:11.360]   And that says the value is not in making a commodity called content.
[02:37:11.360 --> 02:37:12.360]   Watch out.
[02:37:12.360 --> 02:37:17.520]   That's been the case in scootenburg, but it changes to where the value is in things like
[02:37:17.520 --> 02:37:18.520]   relationships.
[02:37:18.520 --> 02:37:19.520]   Right.
[02:37:19.520 --> 02:37:21.120]   So even on must things that Twitter is about content, it's not.
[02:37:21.120 --> 02:37:22.720]   It's about the connections people have.
[02:37:22.720 --> 02:37:23.720]   That's true.
[02:37:23.720 --> 02:37:29.840]   And what would happened with high school papers where they all have to be run through a central
[02:37:29.840 --> 02:37:32.640]   server now in order to detect plagiarism.
[02:37:32.640 --> 02:37:35.680]   Now what do you do with kids who have to write something?
[02:37:35.680 --> 02:37:40.240]   There is watermarking in this and that people are experimenting with us on that story the
[02:37:40.240 --> 02:37:41.240]   other day.
[02:37:41.240 --> 02:37:44.480]   And there are chat GPT detectors already.
[02:37:44.480 --> 02:37:45.480]   Yeah.
[02:37:45.480 --> 02:37:50.840]   So I know one author on a best done an author I know of in real book, put some paragraphs
[02:37:50.840 --> 02:37:56.040]   of her on us to God book and essentially 98% chance it was chat GPT.
[02:37:56.040 --> 02:37:57.040]   Yeah.
[02:37:57.040 --> 02:37:58.440]   You know, remember what happened?
[02:37:58.440 --> 02:38:00.160]   Dolly two came out.
[02:38:00.160 --> 02:38:01.400]   It was constrained.
[02:38:01.400 --> 02:38:05.680]   You had F credits and then somebody did an open source version of stable diffusion and
[02:38:05.680 --> 02:38:07.280]   that's when it took off.
[02:38:07.280 --> 02:38:13.920]   And when somebody does an open source chat GPT that you can train with your own models,
[02:38:13.920 --> 02:38:17.880]   I despair for any detector figuring out that you're using chat.
[02:38:17.880 --> 02:38:18.880]   Yeah.
[02:38:18.880 --> 02:38:21.320]   So here is the stable diffusion for your iPhone.
[02:38:21.320 --> 02:38:22.320]   It's free.
[02:38:22.320 --> 02:38:23.320]   It's open source.
[02:38:23.320 --> 02:38:24.800]   It's called draw things.
[02:38:24.800 --> 02:38:28.560]   And it is if you view stable diffusion, you'll recognize the interface.
[02:38:28.560 --> 02:38:31.920]   You can download other checkpoints other models.
[02:38:31.920 --> 02:38:32.920]   It's pretty impressive.
[02:38:32.920 --> 02:38:37.200]   So how does that work Leo in terms of how it's calling into it?
[02:38:37.200 --> 02:38:41.600]   You have the model on your phone there 1.6 gigs per model.
[02:38:41.600 --> 02:38:45.200]   So you need a model has all if you were disconnected, it would work.
[02:38:45.200 --> 02:38:46.200]   Yes.
[02:38:46.200 --> 02:38:47.200]   Wow.
[02:38:47.200 --> 02:38:48.200]   Wow.
[02:38:48.200 --> 02:38:49.200]   It's in your pocket.
[02:38:49.200 --> 02:38:50.200]   Wow.
[02:38:50.200 --> 02:38:54.120]   So again, the question are we at a inflection point in AI?
[02:38:54.120 --> 02:38:55.120]   Yes.
[02:38:55.120 --> 02:38:56.120]   And I think we've all agreed we are.
[02:38:56.120 --> 02:38:57.120]   Yeah.
[02:38:57.120 --> 02:38:58.120]   Yeah.
[02:38:58.120 --> 02:39:04.040]   We will we look back and say 2022 that was the year that 5G and AI came to life actually
[02:39:04.040 --> 02:39:08.520]   happened when you put that much computing and that much storage in the cloud.
[02:39:08.520 --> 02:39:13.160]   This is and you know, and this much processing power through GPUs.
[02:39:13.160 --> 02:39:18.160]   This is what happens of lads of off writing for Bloomberg said chat GPT could be a good
[02:39:18.160 --> 02:39:20.960]   be AI's iPhone moment.
[02:39:20.960 --> 02:39:21.960]   Yeah.
[02:39:21.960 --> 02:39:25.440]   And I think maybe that's that's a good way to put it.
[02:39:25.440 --> 02:39:27.680]   Hey, it's so much fun talking with you guys.
[02:39:27.680 --> 02:39:32.160]   I wish we could just do this show every week, but you got to make it special with your
[02:39:32.160 --> 02:39:33.660]   green hands.
[02:39:33.660 --> 02:39:36.760]   Let's just briefly go through a list of some of the people we lost this year.
[02:39:36.760 --> 02:39:41.880]   This is something it's always the sad part of the Academy Awards when they play a sad
[02:39:41.880 --> 02:39:46.120]   song and they have pictures of your favorites and it's going to be a long list this year.
[02:39:46.120 --> 02:39:50.840]   We lost a lot of people, but what what doesn't happen is we don't often acknowledge the
[02:39:50.840 --> 02:39:55.080]   pioneers in technology who we lost this year.
[02:39:55.080 --> 02:39:57.080]   I try to at the end of a Twits.
[02:39:57.080 --> 02:39:58.840]   Maybe that's something that happens with age.
[02:39:58.840 --> 02:40:01.000]   You start reading obituaries.
[02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:05.840]   You start you start looking at what age they passed things like that, but we lost quite
[02:40:05.840 --> 02:40:11.640]   a few people because we're getting to that age, you know, computing is getting old enough
[02:40:11.640 --> 02:40:17.760]   now that some of its earliest pioneers are in their 80s and 90s like John Roach, the
[02:40:17.760 --> 02:40:19.640]   pioneer of the personal computer.
[02:40:19.640 --> 02:40:26.560]   He was the guy working at Tandy who decided to make the TRS 80.
[02:40:26.560 --> 02:40:30.200]   He passed this year at the age of 83.
[02:40:30.200 --> 02:40:37.600]   He introduced in the late 90s, late 70s, 1970s, the TRS 80 for 600 bucks through Radio
[02:40:37.600 --> 02:40:38.600]   Shack stores.
[02:40:38.600 --> 02:40:43.480]   I know there are awful lot of us, a lot of you listening who got your start with the
[02:40:43.480 --> 02:40:47.800]   TRS 80 or trash 80 as we used to call it.
[02:40:47.800 --> 02:40:50.960]   Us cometer users used to call it.
[02:40:50.960 --> 02:40:53.920]   Steve Willhight, the creator of the GIF.
[02:40:53.920 --> 02:40:58.840]   By the way, he said before he passed, it's GIF.
[02:40:58.840 --> 02:40:59.840]   It's all right.
[02:40:59.840 --> 02:41:03.800]   We'll call it GIF tomorrow, but today Steve Willhight.
[02:41:03.800 --> 02:41:09.520]   One of the inventors of the GIF format passed away from COVID at the age of 74.
[02:41:09.520 --> 02:41:13.080]   That was in March of this year.
[02:41:13.080 --> 02:41:18.280]   He worked on the graphics interchange format for CompuServe.
[02:41:18.280 --> 02:41:19.640]   They were looking for another way to...
[02:41:19.640 --> 02:41:21.800]   It's called CompuServe, Jeff.
[02:41:21.800 --> 02:41:22.800]   Yeah.
[02:41:22.800 --> 02:41:23.800]   And it was in Cumbord.
[02:41:23.800 --> 02:41:25.280]   It was patent in Cumbord for a long time, right?
[02:41:25.280 --> 02:41:26.680]   Yeah, because of the compression.
[02:41:26.680 --> 02:41:31.040]   Spary, I think, owned the patent of all people.
[02:41:31.040 --> 02:41:36.960]   Gilbert Gottfried, the comic, passed, but his connection with tech was...
[02:41:36.960 --> 02:41:37.960]   I love this.
[02:41:37.960 --> 02:41:38.960]   This is kind of action.
[02:41:38.960 --> 02:41:40.960]   It was the voice of Clippy.
[02:41:40.960 --> 02:41:42.400]   Right there behind Paul.
[02:41:42.400 --> 02:41:44.960]   Also the voice of the Affleck Duck.
[02:41:44.960 --> 02:41:45.960]   Can I play a little?
[02:41:45.960 --> 02:41:47.400]   Let me play a little...
[02:41:47.400 --> 02:41:52.720]   Here we go, a little Clippy for you.
[02:41:52.720 --> 02:41:58.640]   This is from a Flash player playing an Office XP.
[02:41:58.640 --> 02:41:59.920]   Say hello, Clippy.
[02:41:59.920 --> 02:42:01.240]   Why hello there.
[02:42:01.240 --> 02:42:05.400]   I'm leveraging real-time legacy compliant collaborative micro-branding to complete the
[02:42:05.400 --> 02:42:08.280]   most important project in my company's history.
[02:42:08.280 --> 02:42:10.280]   As soon as I finish this proposal, I...
[02:42:10.280 --> 02:42:12.320]   It looks like you're riding a one.
[02:42:12.320 --> 02:42:14.120]   Would you like, hell?
[02:42:14.120 --> 02:42:15.120]   Okay, enough.
[02:42:15.120 --> 02:42:17.400]   I don't want any PTSD to...
[02:42:17.400 --> 02:42:18.400]   I should have had a hit.
[02:42:18.400 --> 02:42:21.080]   Control S trigger warning there.
[02:42:21.080 --> 02:42:22.680]   Yeah, you still do, don't you, Jeff.
[02:42:22.680 --> 02:42:23.680]   You said you did that.
[02:42:23.680 --> 02:42:24.680]   It is very funny.
[02:42:24.680 --> 02:42:25.680]   As you're going.
[02:42:25.680 --> 02:42:26.680]   It's a very funny guy.
[02:42:26.680 --> 02:42:27.680]   Amazing.
[02:42:27.680 --> 02:42:29.200]   There's a great documentary about him.
[02:42:29.200 --> 02:42:30.600]   He was quirky.
[02:42:30.600 --> 02:42:32.600]   He collected hotel soaps.
[02:42:32.600 --> 02:42:34.600]   I do that.
[02:42:34.600 --> 02:42:37.400]   But I used them.
[02:42:37.400 --> 02:42:39.200]   Yeah, he never used them, apparently.
[02:42:39.200 --> 02:42:41.240]   His wife showed a whole under his bed.
[02:42:41.240 --> 02:42:44.480]   There were thousands of hotel soaps.
[02:42:44.480 --> 02:42:52.760]   The co-founder of Razor and a pioneer of the gaming mouse passed this year, Robert Krakow.
[02:42:52.760 --> 02:42:54.480]   He was 81.
[02:42:54.480 --> 02:42:59.120]   He created the gaming hardware company Razor and was the first to make a mouse to make
[02:42:59.120 --> 02:43:02.240]   a mouse design specifically for gaming.
[02:43:02.240 --> 02:43:03.760]   The Razor, do you remember this?
[02:43:03.760 --> 02:43:05.480]   I know Paul, you remember the Razor?
[02:43:05.480 --> 02:43:06.480]   They're still around.
[02:43:06.480 --> 02:43:08.280]   The Razor boom slang.
[02:43:08.280 --> 02:43:09.280]   Sure.
[02:43:09.280 --> 02:43:10.280]   Yeah.
[02:43:10.280 --> 02:43:12.160]   The Razor's still around, but the boom slang.
[02:43:12.160 --> 02:43:13.160]   There was a mouse.
[02:43:13.160 --> 02:43:17.200]   Yeah, that was a mouse.
[02:43:17.200 --> 02:43:19.320]   You actually, this came from a doc.
[02:43:19.320 --> 02:43:23.920]   He apparently knew Craig Burton passed away this year.
[02:43:23.920 --> 02:43:25.640]   Tell us who Craig Burton was.
[02:43:25.640 --> 02:43:34.400]   Craig, I remember back in the middle of the late '80s, networking was, there was data
[02:43:34.400 --> 02:43:36.280]   communications and communications with you.
[02:43:36.280 --> 02:43:42.240]   These are fat magazines and they came out weekly or monthly and it was all Cytec versus
[02:43:42.240 --> 02:43:43.440]   3Com versus IBM.
[02:43:43.440 --> 02:43:44.440]   Remember.
[02:43:44.440 --> 02:43:46.440]   It was token ring.
[02:43:46.440 --> 02:43:48.440]   Token ring versus ethernet.
[02:43:48.440 --> 02:43:49.440]   Yeah.
[02:43:49.440 --> 02:43:50.440]   It wins.
[02:43:50.440 --> 02:43:51.440]   Yeah.
[02:43:51.440 --> 02:43:52.440]   And novel came along and said, "We don't care what it is.
[02:43:52.440 --> 02:43:55.480]   We're going to run the software on that."
[02:43:55.480 --> 02:43:56.480]   And that was Craig's idea.
[02:43:56.480 --> 02:44:02.640]   Craig's idea was that the one level above that, novel before Craig was basically made
[02:44:02.640 --> 02:44:06.000]   yet another sort of some piece of hardware.
[02:44:06.000 --> 02:44:09.800]   They were actually in the hardware business, but they didn't like to brag on that.
[02:44:09.800 --> 02:44:16.120]   There's one point where Craig told me, he said, "We are actually the number one seller
[02:44:16.120 --> 02:44:19.360]   of ethernet boards and for PCs."
[02:44:19.360 --> 02:44:21.480]   I said, "Why don't you make a thing of it?"
[02:44:21.480 --> 02:44:24.480]   He said, "Because it's going to be a zero dollar business pretty soon."
[02:44:24.480 --> 02:44:25.320]   That's right.
[02:44:25.320 --> 02:44:26.320]   It's going to go away.
[02:44:26.320 --> 02:44:27.320]   Absolutely come out of it.
[02:44:27.320 --> 02:44:29.680]   He was so full of wisdom on a lot of things.
[02:44:29.680 --> 02:44:33.680]   And after he and his wife, they weren't married at first.
[02:44:33.680 --> 02:44:36.880]   They had kind of an affair and then they got married Judith Clark, who then became Judith
[02:44:36.880 --> 02:44:39.160]   Burton.
[02:44:39.160 --> 02:44:44.240]   She invented land times, a bunch of conferences and things.
[02:44:44.240 --> 02:44:46.320]   It's just really brilliant people.
[02:44:46.320 --> 02:44:52.440]   And they became good friends because I work with them through the advertising agency I
[02:44:52.440 --> 02:44:57.040]   had in the late '80s and early '90s.
[02:44:57.040 --> 02:45:03.760]   And they started a consulting outfit called the Burton Group, which had a bunch of conferences
[02:45:03.760 --> 02:45:04.760]   and things.
[02:45:04.760 --> 02:45:06.320]   But he was a really brilliant guy.
[02:45:06.320 --> 02:45:12.960]   And he also introduced me to Kim Cameron, who died a little over a year ago.
[02:45:12.960 --> 02:45:15.520]   But Kim was the law giver on identity.
[02:45:15.520 --> 02:45:26.880]   He had the seven laws of identity, which have guided Microsoft and everybody else since 2004.
[02:45:26.880 --> 02:45:35.640]   Basically limited disclosure for constrained use, justifiable parties, individual control
[02:45:35.640 --> 02:45:36.880]   and consent.
[02:45:36.880 --> 02:45:43.080]   And when Kim was first at Microsoft is when they were trying to do passport.
[02:45:43.080 --> 02:45:44.880]   Remember passport was part of the hit?
[02:45:44.880 --> 02:45:50.880]   The hailstorm was the stupidest names ever for a brilliant idea for a single sign on
[02:45:50.880 --> 02:45:51.880]   passports.
[02:45:51.880 --> 02:45:52.880]   Yeah.
[02:45:52.880 --> 02:45:57.720]   And one of the things Kim said to me was when you see the corpse of passport floating
[02:45:57.720 --> 02:46:01.400]   down his river, one of the knives in his back will be mine.
[02:46:01.400 --> 02:46:07.800]   He was from Canada and he was one of the sweetest, least aggressive people on earth.
[02:46:07.800 --> 02:46:08.960]   But he was great.
[02:46:08.960 --> 02:46:12.520]   And both of them were good friends and they died in the last year.
[02:46:12.520 --> 02:46:18.080]   And so easy to forget we focus on the Elon Musk is the world that really those guys aren't
[02:46:18.080 --> 02:46:19.080]   doing anything.
[02:46:19.080 --> 02:46:24.360]   It's the people who are doing the real work like Craig Burton that really are making
[02:46:24.360 --> 02:46:25.360]   a difference.
[02:46:25.360 --> 02:46:27.880]   And they don't they so little celebrated so little remembered.
[02:46:27.880 --> 02:46:33.560]   So it's one of the reasons I wanted to do this is to remember these folks.
[02:46:33.560 --> 02:46:35.880]   Dave Smith passed this year.
[02:46:35.880 --> 02:46:37.800]   He created MIDI.
[02:46:37.800 --> 02:46:40.320]   That's sequential.
[02:46:40.320 --> 02:46:50.320]   He also introduced the Prophet five since he was the father of MIDI dead at the age of 72.
[02:46:50.320 --> 02:46:54.160]   You know, I mean, how many of you have used MIDI?
[02:46:54.160 --> 02:46:55.160]   Everybody right?
[02:46:55.160 --> 02:46:57.920]   And and synthesizers wouldn't exist without it.
[02:46:57.920 --> 02:47:03.800]   Dave Smith are we didn't we were lucky we didn't lose anybody in our family.
[02:47:03.800 --> 02:47:08.280]   Well, we only lost one in our family and that was John Foster who was one of the originals
[02:47:08.280 --> 02:47:09.800]   on Mac break weekly.
[02:47:09.800 --> 02:47:12.200]   He was a pixel core member.
[02:47:12.200 --> 02:47:14.440]   He was on our podcasts.
[02:47:14.440 --> 02:47:17.240]   He also passed away this year.
[02:47:17.240 --> 02:47:23.320]   And he later started a podcast about beer, which is probably what what maybe what he'll
[02:47:23.320 --> 02:47:24.320]   be best remembered for.
[02:47:24.320 --> 02:47:28.760]   But there is in the original pixel core offices downtown on Market Street in San Francisco
[02:47:28.760 --> 02:47:35.080]   with Alex Lindsey, probably doing an early Mac break episode John Foster history.
[02:47:35.080 --> 02:47:36.080]   Yeah.
[02:47:36.080 --> 02:47:42.040]   And again, you know, I remember you remember these people, but often they aren't very well
[02:47:42.040 --> 02:47:43.040]   known.
[02:47:43.040 --> 02:47:50.800]   Here's one who of course was Michelle Nichols, Star Trek's Lieutenant who passed this year
[02:47:50.800 --> 02:47:54.760]   and her ashes are actually in space.
[02:47:54.760 --> 02:47:56.880]   Launched out into into space.
[02:47:56.880 --> 02:47:57.880]   Here's NASA's tweet.
[02:47:57.880 --> 02:48:03.560]   We celebrate the life of Michelle Nichols Star Trek actor trailblazer and role model.
[02:48:03.560 --> 02:48:08.600]   She said she wanted to quit star trek because she had so little to do.
[02:48:08.600 --> 02:48:14.400]   And Jean Ronbury said you can't because you are a role model for black people and black
[02:48:14.400 --> 02:48:17.880]   women, especially everywhere you need to be on.
[02:48:17.880 --> 02:48:22.400]   She of course, the first interracial kiss with captain.
[02:48:22.400 --> 02:48:27.120]   She helped NASA a lot too later on as a PR kind of right.
[02:48:27.120 --> 02:48:28.120]   Yeah.
[02:48:28.120 --> 02:48:29.120]   Good.
[02:48:29.120 --> 02:48:34.960]   This year, so did Kathleen Booth, the inventor of assembly language.
[02:48:34.960 --> 02:48:36.400]   Her story is a fascinating.
[02:48:36.400 --> 02:48:37.760]   She was a hundred years old.
[02:48:37.760 --> 02:48:40.720]   She born in 1922.
[02:48:40.720 --> 02:48:46.240]   Her career with computers began during World War II in the very earliest computers.
[02:48:46.240 --> 02:48:54.040]   She designed in 1946 with her future husband, the automatic relay calculator, one of the
[02:48:54.040 --> 02:48:56.240]   very first digital computers.
[02:48:56.240 --> 02:49:02.400]   And of course, if you've got a digital computer, somebody's got to write the code for it.
[02:49:02.400 --> 02:49:03.440]   So she did.
[02:49:03.440 --> 02:49:09.280]   And so I know Steve as a user of assembly language, you probably want to mark.
[02:49:09.280 --> 02:49:13.800]   He also stayed active throughout her entire life and just recently wrote a published a
[02:49:13.800 --> 02:49:18.840]   book with her son on some advanced computer technology.
[02:49:18.840 --> 02:49:20.400]   So on neural nets.
[02:49:20.400 --> 02:49:21.400]   Get along.
[02:49:21.400 --> 02:49:22.400]   Yes.
[02:49:22.400 --> 02:49:27.560]   That's spanning the entire history of computing from the first digital computers to using neural
[02:49:27.560 --> 02:49:32.520]   nets to identify marine mammals, right in 1993.
[02:49:32.520 --> 02:49:34.720]   That's a that's really amazing.
[02:49:34.720 --> 02:49:36.200]   Kathleen Booth.
[02:49:36.200 --> 02:49:44.000]   I know our fans were saddened by the passing of Kevin Conroy, the voice of Batman.
[02:49:44.000 --> 02:49:50.920]   They may not know his name or his face, but you definitely know his voice, which I will
[02:49:50.920 --> 02:49:56.920]   not play because apparently nobody wants me to, but you will remember his voice.
[02:49:56.920 --> 02:49:58.440]   Let me see if I can find the tweet.
[02:49:58.440 --> 02:49:59.440]   Maybe the tweet will.
[02:49:59.440 --> 02:50:01.240]   Oh, it was Bruce Wayne.
[02:50:01.240 --> 02:50:03.120]   He was Batman and Bruce Wayne.
[02:50:03.120 --> 02:50:04.120]   Wait a minute.
[02:50:04.120 --> 02:50:06.320]   I hope that's not a spoiler.
[02:50:06.320 --> 02:50:07.320]   What?
[02:50:07.320 --> 02:50:08.320]   What?
[02:50:08.320 --> 02:50:10.760]   No, forget it.
[02:50:10.760 --> 02:50:14.680]   Forget what I just forget what I just said.
[02:50:14.680 --> 02:50:16.760]   Also a science fiction author, you and I love.
[02:50:16.760 --> 02:50:19.520]   I know Steve Greg Baer passed away.
[02:50:19.520 --> 02:50:20.520]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:50:20.520 --> 02:50:21.520]   This year.
[02:50:21.520 --> 02:50:22.520]   He wrote Eon.
[02:50:22.520 --> 02:50:23.520]   Yeah, good book.
[02:50:23.520 --> 02:50:31.880]   I loved Darwin's radio, blood music, wonderful Hugo award winning books.
[02:50:31.880 --> 02:50:33.080]   Passed away.
[02:50:33.080 --> 02:50:34.080]   We lost a great one.
[02:50:34.080 --> 02:50:35.920]   One of the great people are not old enough.
[02:50:35.920 --> 02:50:37.520]   Yeah, 1951.
[02:50:37.520 --> 02:50:40.320]   That's all these people are younger than me.
[02:50:40.320 --> 02:50:41.320]   I don't like it.
[02:50:41.320 --> 02:50:45.280]   Like I said, you get to a certain age, you start reading the.
[02:50:45.280 --> 02:50:46.280]   I know it's terrible.
[02:50:46.280 --> 02:50:47.280]   Obituaries.
[02:50:47.280 --> 02:50:48.280]   And what do you look at?
[02:50:48.280 --> 02:50:49.280]   At the age.
[02:50:49.280 --> 02:50:56.040]   And unfortunately, the phrase knowing where the bodies are buried is unfortunately literal.
[02:50:56.040 --> 02:51:02.840]   And finally, Frederick P. Brooks Jr. passed away just a few weeks ago at the age of 91.
[02:51:02.840 --> 02:51:06.280]   There he is holding a Macintosh for some reason.
[02:51:06.280 --> 02:51:11.920]   Best known, best known not because of the Mac, but because he wrote the book, the Mythical
[02:51:11.920 --> 02:51:17.520]   Man Month, which was one of the great computer science books.
[02:51:17.520 --> 02:51:22.000]   The idea that throwing more people at a computer problem will not solve it.
[02:51:22.000 --> 02:51:23.000]   It makes it longer.
[02:51:23.000 --> 02:51:24.000]   Yeah, it just makes it worse.
[02:51:24.000 --> 02:51:26.240]   And these people do a late project makes it longer.
[02:51:26.240 --> 02:51:27.240]   Yep.
[02:51:27.240 --> 02:51:28.240]   Makes it later.
[02:51:28.240 --> 02:51:29.240]   Came out in '75.
[02:51:29.240 --> 02:51:32.040]   You know, somebody told me it doesn't age well.
[02:51:32.040 --> 02:51:33.440]   Things have changed a little bit, but.
[02:51:33.440 --> 02:51:34.440]   I don't know.
[02:51:34.440 --> 02:51:37.280]   Eon must seem to be following this guideline.
[02:51:37.280 --> 02:51:39.400]   I remember, I have the book.
[02:51:39.400 --> 02:51:44.080]   I remember reading it and finding it very informative and important.
[02:51:44.080 --> 02:51:49.440]   So that's the last of the humans that I at least know of that pass this year.
[02:51:49.440 --> 02:51:56.640]   But we should probably tip a cup to Stadia, which also passed away this year, killed by
[02:51:56.640 --> 02:51:57.640]   Google.
[02:51:57.640 --> 02:51:58.800]   We hardly knew you.
[02:51:58.800 --> 02:52:00.680]   We hardly knew you.
[02:52:00.680 --> 02:52:02.600]   But at least we got our money back.
[02:52:02.600 --> 02:52:04.200]   Folks, you are great.
[02:52:04.200 --> 02:52:05.840]   I love you all.
[02:52:05.840 --> 02:52:07.640]   I love doing shows with you.
[02:52:07.640 --> 02:52:08.640]   And we love you.
[02:52:08.640 --> 02:52:12.480]   It's the greatest privilege in the world to get to talk to these people.
[02:52:12.480 --> 02:52:14.400]   Did we say Merry Christmas to Lisa?
[02:52:14.400 --> 02:52:15.400]   She just left.
[02:52:15.400 --> 02:52:16.400]   Lisa left.
[02:52:16.400 --> 02:52:19.360]   She, because we got a football game coming up.
[02:52:19.360 --> 02:52:22.000]   No, no, I think the Niners are playing in an hour.
[02:52:22.000 --> 02:52:24.640]   Lisa has priorities is what he's saying.
[02:52:24.640 --> 02:52:25.640]   Yeah.
[02:52:25.640 --> 02:52:26.800]   No, she was here for most of the show.
[02:52:26.800 --> 02:52:28.000]   She really enjoyed it.
[02:52:28.000 --> 02:52:29.840]   Paul Thorett, I will see you on Wednesday.
[02:52:29.840 --> 02:52:34.400]   We're going to wear our Clippy Swetters in honor of Gilbert Gottfried.
[02:52:34.400 --> 02:52:35.400]   Your hat is slipping backwards.
[02:52:35.400 --> 02:52:38.160]   You know, it's skewing.
[02:52:38.160 --> 02:52:39.640]   It's too small for my head.
[02:52:39.640 --> 02:52:42.640]   Hostowinders, we're here.
[02:52:42.640 --> 02:52:43.760]   Therot.com, of course, is where he blogs.
[02:52:43.760 --> 02:52:45.160]   His books are at leanpub.com.
[02:52:45.160 --> 02:52:47.560]   Get the field guide to Windows 11.
[02:52:47.560 --> 02:52:49.240]   I hope you have a wonderful holiday.
[02:52:49.240 --> 02:52:52.000]   I'm really grateful that you came this afternoon at Extra.
[02:52:52.000 --> 02:52:53.960]   Yeah, you're good to see everybody here.
[02:52:53.960 --> 02:52:54.960]   Thank you.
[02:52:54.960 --> 02:52:56.800]   It's so nice to have you guys here.
[02:52:56.800 --> 02:52:59.560]   Steve Gibson, the Grinch, who did not steal.
[02:52:59.560 --> 02:53:01.480]   I'm wearing this from now on.
[02:53:01.480 --> 02:53:02.480]   You look so good.
[02:53:02.480 --> 02:53:03.480]   I know.
[02:53:03.480 --> 02:53:04.960]   You found Zedd, haven't you?
[02:53:04.960 --> 02:53:05.960]   It's the new one.
[02:53:05.960 --> 02:53:06.960]   Oh, it's crazy.
[02:53:06.960 --> 02:53:08.360]   He's a mean one.
[02:53:08.360 --> 02:53:10.680]   Extra Steve, he'll be back Tuesday.
[02:53:10.680 --> 02:53:13.040]   Security now our last show of the year.
[02:53:13.040 --> 02:53:17.480]   And of course, he's so happy.
[02:53:17.480 --> 02:53:18.480]   He has found his food.
[02:53:18.480 --> 02:53:19.640]   He really got into it.
[02:53:19.640 --> 02:53:23.600]   I thought by the end of the show, he may not be able to stop when the show is over.
[02:53:23.600 --> 02:53:25.280]   I'm going to dream about him tonight.
[02:53:25.280 --> 02:53:26.280]   That's a weird way.
[02:53:26.280 --> 02:53:28.600]   Maybe in a weird way.
[02:53:28.600 --> 02:53:31.320]   Can you do the live, long and prosper in the Grinch?
[02:53:31.320 --> 02:53:32.320]   Oh, boy.
[02:53:32.320 --> 02:53:33.320]   I don't know.
[02:53:33.320 --> 02:53:34.320]   Hey, you can.
[02:53:34.320 --> 02:53:35.320]   Yeah, I know you can do it.
[02:53:35.320 --> 02:53:36.320]   You can definitely do it.
[02:53:36.320 --> 02:53:37.320]   Bless you, Steve.
[02:53:37.320 --> 02:53:38.320]   It's great.
[02:53:38.320 --> 02:53:40.640]   Jeff Jarvis is the next screen.
[02:53:40.640 --> 02:53:41.640]   Yeah.
[02:53:41.640 --> 02:53:44.840]   You know, it's just a matter of time before people put things in those gloves.
[02:53:44.840 --> 02:53:45.840]   Yes.
[02:53:45.840 --> 02:53:50.360]   Jeff Jarvis, Buzzmachine.com, our host here at this week in Google.
[02:53:50.360 --> 02:53:52.080]   I'll see you Wednesday for our last show.
[02:53:52.080 --> 02:53:53.080]   Yes, you will.
[02:53:53.080 --> 02:53:56.800]   Love the year we missed you yesterday, but I'm so glad to get you on this show.
[02:53:56.800 --> 02:53:58.160]   I appreciated his book.
[02:53:58.160 --> 02:54:02.400]   He's coming out next year, 2023, to get the Gutenberg book.
[02:54:02.400 --> 02:54:04.560]   He's been talking about it for a decade.
[02:54:04.560 --> 02:54:06.200]   B-I-T endlessly.
[02:54:06.200 --> 02:54:09.880]   And finally, the good news is once it comes out that I can probably stop talking about
[02:54:09.880 --> 02:54:10.880]   it.
[02:54:10.880 --> 02:54:13.720]   No, no, we don't want you to because everybody gets drunk when you say Gutenberg.
[02:54:13.720 --> 02:54:19.200]   B-I-T dot L-Y slash buy Gutenberg if you want to pre-order the book.
[02:54:19.200 --> 02:54:20.200]   Great to have you.
[02:54:20.200 --> 02:54:21.200]   Thank you, boss.
[02:54:21.200 --> 02:54:22.200]   Thanks for being here.
[02:54:22.200 --> 02:54:26.080]   Doc Serrel's the host of Floss Weekly every Wednesday.
[02:54:26.080 --> 02:54:27.080]   It's great to have you.
[02:54:27.080 --> 02:54:29.800]   He's right before our Windows Weekly.
[02:54:29.800 --> 02:54:32.520]   Legend in the open source community.
[02:54:32.520 --> 02:54:34.560]   A long time editor of the Linux Journal has real-
[02:54:34.560 --> 02:54:35.560]   Yeah, just to...
[02:54:35.560 --> 02:54:36.560]   Legend exceeds me.
[02:54:36.560 --> 02:54:38.200]   Yeah, it's just fine.
[02:54:38.200 --> 02:54:40.120]   Doc.serrels.com.
[02:54:40.120 --> 02:54:42.240]   We'll see you Wednesday for Floss.
[02:54:42.240 --> 02:54:44.720]   And I'm going to be on a special Floss.
[02:54:44.720 --> 02:54:48.080]   It's kind of similar next year, right?
[02:54:48.080 --> 02:54:49.400]   We're doing a special Floss.
[02:54:49.400 --> 02:54:51.480]   It's on my calendar, I think.
[02:54:51.480 --> 02:54:52.640]   Well, yeah, we have to.
[02:54:52.640 --> 02:54:55.440]   It was great having you at the end of the radio when we did.
[02:54:55.440 --> 02:54:57.520]   Oh, yeah, Tim, Tim, Poser, my old friend was on.
[02:54:57.520 --> 02:54:58.520]   Tim, Poser, we talked about low power.
[02:54:58.520 --> 02:54:59.880]   We're going to have him back.
[02:54:59.880 --> 02:55:00.880]   We should have you back for the show.
[02:55:00.880 --> 02:55:02.360]   I'll come for the whole show and next time.
[02:55:02.360 --> 02:55:03.360]   But I will go for that whole show because it'll be great.
[02:55:03.360 --> 02:55:05.360]   I'll be on the all-round table later.
[02:55:05.360 --> 02:55:06.360]   Yeah.
[02:55:06.360 --> 02:55:08.760]   Earlier next year.
[02:55:08.760 --> 02:55:10.160]   Thank you all for joining us.
[02:55:10.160 --> 02:55:11.360]   We love our audience too.
[02:55:11.360 --> 02:55:12.560]   Couldn't do it without you.
[02:55:12.560 --> 02:55:18.560]   I really appreciate your patience with us over the past 17 years.
[02:55:18.560 --> 02:55:23.040]   I'm looking forward to a very exciting 2023.
[02:55:23.040 --> 02:55:26.640]   One of the best things about covering tech is it's ever-changing.
[02:55:26.640 --> 02:55:28.080]   It's always interesting.
[02:55:28.080 --> 02:55:31.200]   And it's always, I think, pretty important to our future.
[02:55:31.200 --> 02:55:34.000]   So thank you for participating at TWIT.
[02:55:34.000 --> 02:55:35.360]   We have many ways you can do that.
[02:55:35.360 --> 02:55:36.640]   Of course, you can watch our shows.
[02:55:36.640 --> 02:55:41.280]   We send out live audio and video of our shows as we record them.
[02:55:41.280 --> 02:55:44.680]   We make them available for download too as podcasts.
[02:55:44.680 --> 02:55:49.400]   You can communicate with us in our IRC at irc.twit.tv.
[02:55:49.400 --> 02:55:52.040]   We have a mastodon at twit.social.
[02:55:52.040 --> 02:55:56.640]   We have a discourse forums, which are great at twit.community.
[02:55:56.640 --> 02:55:58.360]   And of course, the club twit is the best way
[02:55:58.360 --> 02:56:00.320]   to participate seven bucks a month.
[02:56:00.320 --> 02:56:02.800]   But you get ad-free versions of all the shows.
[02:56:02.800 --> 02:56:04.920]   You get the club twit discord.
[02:56:04.920 --> 02:56:07.360]   You get the special shows that we don't put anywhere else,
[02:56:07.360 --> 02:56:10.720]   like Paul Thorett's Hands-On Windows,
[02:56:10.720 --> 02:56:13.160]   Michael Sargent's Hands-On Macintosh, the Untitled Linux
[02:56:13.160 --> 02:56:17.040]   Show with your co-host, Jonathan Bennett, Doc.
[02:56:17.040 --> 02:56:19.000]   And the use of his-- oh, he's wonderful.
[02:56:19.000 --> 02:56:21.480]   Lots of great content on the feed.
[02:56:21.480 --> 02:56:26.120]   But mostly, it helps us smooth out the ups and downs.
[02:56:26.120 --> 02:56:27.360]   We are an ad-supported network.
[02:56:27.360 --> 02:56:30.480]   But honestly, if I had my brothers,
[02:56:30.480 --> 02:56:33.040]   I'd be a Twits-supported network.
[02:56:33.040 --> 02:56:34.960]   You help us with that when you join.
[02:56:34.960 --> 02:56:36.320]   Twit.tv/clubtwit.
[02:56:36.320 --> 02:56:38.440]   I know it's Christmas Day, but if you
[02:56:38.440 --> 02:56:41.320]   didn't get that special gift yet for the geek in your life,
[02:56:41.320 --> 02:56:43.720]   there is a year package that would be just right.
[02:56:43.720 --> 02:56:46.160]   Twit.tv/clubtwit.
[02:56:46.160 --> 02:56:47.080]   Have a wonderful--
[02:56:47.080 --> 02:56:48.040]   Let me come--
[02:56:48.040 --> 02:56:48.960]   Wait a second, wait a second.
[02:56:48.960 --> 02:56:50.160]   Because they don't get commercial.
[02:56:50.160 --> 02:56:51.080]   They don't hear that.
[02:56:51.080 --> 02:56:53.400]   Let us at the-- say Merry Christmas.
[02:56:53.400 --> 02:56:54.400]   Happy holidays.
[02:56:54.400 --> 02:56:56.880]   I mean, thank you Santa Claus Club Twit Number.
[02:56:56.880 --> 02:56:57.640]   Thank you, Club Twit.
[02:56:57.640 --> 02:56:59.120]   We are all grateful for supporting you.
[02:56:59.120 --> 02:56:59.620]   Twit.
[02:56:59.620 --> 02:57:00.120]   You're right.
[02:57:00.120 --> 02:57:01.760]   They don't get any ads, including the ad for Club Twit.
[02:57:01.760 --> 02:57:03.320]   But we are very grateful that they--
[02:57:03.320 --> 02:57:03.820]   Yay.
[02:57:03.820 --> 02:57:04.480]   --are grateful to you all.
[02:57:04.480 --> 02:57:06.360]   And we are able to do a lot of stuff in the club
[02:57:06.360 --> 02:57:08.080]   that really is special.
[02:57:08.080 --> 02:57:10.560]   So yeah, it's a way of showing your support.
[02:57:10.560 --> 02:57:13.320]   But it's a way of us also getting a better, more
[02:57:13.320 --> 02:57:14.400]   intimate interaction with you.
[02:57:14.400 --> 02:57:15.280]   So we're happy.
[02:57:15.280 --> 02:57:16.720]   Now you can say goodbye.

[02:57:17.760 --> 02:57:19.280]   Have a wonderful Christmas.
[02:57:19.280 --> 02:57:20.760]   We recorded this on the 15th.
[02:57:20.760 --> 02:57:23.080]   So anything that happened in the past 10 days,
[02:57:23.080 --> 02:57:24.080]   we didn't know about.
[02:57:24.080 --> 02:57:25.440]   It's not our fault.
[02:57:25.440 --> 02:57:26.400]   We're not AI.
[02:57:26.400 --> 02:57:27.400]   We don't know the future.
[02:57:27.400 --> 02:57:28.880]   We don't know the future.
[02:57:28.880 --> 02:57:30.880]   Mag 3, what's that?
[02:57:30.880 --> 02:57:32.800]   But we are so glad you were here.
[02:57:32.800 --> 02:57:34.160]   I do hope you have a great holiday.
[02:57:34.160 --> 02:57:34.600]   I see.
[02:57:34.600 --> 02:57:37.280]   We may not even be I.
[02:57:37.280 --> 02:57:39.640]   Yeah, we're just A. No I.
[02:57:39.640 --> 02:57:43.800]   We will be back with a best of show on New Year's Day.
[02:57:43.800 --> 02:57:46.200]   That'll be the best of 2022.
[02:57:46.200 --> 02:57:49.640]   And then a brand new Twit on January 8.
[02:57:49.640 --> 02:57:52.240]   All the shows return after New Year's Day.
[02:57:52.240 --> 02:57:53.200]   Thank you, everybody.
