[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.520]   give me the CNET title you both we were with Ed you ever worked for CNET
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:34.960]   Denise we'll have the because I worked for CNET too I worked for Zee Dnet well
[00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:39.880]   I blocked for that that's close enough right same are you part of the Facebook
[00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.760]   page there's a X CNET employee Facebook page I know I'll have to sign up I would
[00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.120]   I would win a prize because I was the fourth employee you've seen it are you
[00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.320]   part of that page I'll invite you I want to be on that page because I was it was
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:04:02.840]   a Shelby lineman and the weirdo and who is the other guy I've forgotten him he
[00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.520]   got in trouble with the state of California for not paying his taxes he
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.320]   bought he bought a race horse because he could he looked it in the eyes and he
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:15.520]   could see it was a winner I forgot his name I can't it just keeps you know what
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:20.520]   I'm talking about oh his reputation precedes him yes Halsey minor that's it
[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:25.640]   that's it yeah and I remember he told me there that Halsey minor at the University
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.240]   of Virginia there's a Halsey Hall and a minor hall and they're right across the
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:33.640]   street because his family is an old Virginia family it comes from money and
[00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:37.360]   that was that was like the fourth employee it was just the two of them when I was
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:43.520]   hired to be the VP of programming for one week what's out the door and that was
[00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.960]   it were there when Ryan C. Crest was there oh no no no he came after me I
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.840]   literally I did their first pilot with the Vorac and I'll mean guy go way back
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.600]   but that's a long and boring story let's get into the news because there's a lot
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:59.080]   of it we'll be talking about Google I own a bit and I do have the most valuable
[00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.560]   Jimmy you know every year at Google's developer conference they give away
[00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.120]   notebooks they give away phones they give away the Google Q which they never
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.560]   even sold that's got to be worth something if you still have your Google Q but this
[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:15.480]   year yeah you got Android where watch is sure but more to the point you got
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:22.600]   cardboard you have yours Tim because you were at Google I.O. I do yeah I actually
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.120]   haven't opened mine yet so it's still in the folded up form totally unopened I'm
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.680]   gonna shrink wrap that thing I'm gonna go down the comic book store and get one of
[00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.480]   those acid-free baggies I think and put it in there you should store it for a
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:40.200]   couple decades we just checked on eBay 86 bucks for Google cardboard unopened
[00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:44.520]   assembled I think is gonna have less it's less valuable but unopened right out of
[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.240]   them I know some people who were at the keynote who came out the door too late
[00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.560]   and weren't able to get them so you didn't have to get out there really oh I got
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.520]   mine Gina and Jeff were there I wasn't there but they gave me mine this was this
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.080]   was a flat piece of cardboard Gina took the time to assemble it in the car right
[00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:02.120]   up here it's got a little magnet thing on the side with a rubber band it's got
[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:06.320]   some plastic lenses that's the only thing that be hard to get they do have the
[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:10.280]   plans online and then you could either go to a website or download on the Google
[00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:14.720]   Play Store the free cardboard app you put on your smartphone has to be an
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:20.240]   Android phone you put the smartphone in here it senses that it's in the box and
[00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:28.040]   it gives you it gives you a VR view and I think the whole thing is that for a
[00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:32.120]   buck 50 they made something that's worth that does the same thing Oculus Rift does
[00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:38.360]   for two billion because it does it's stereo pretty impressive it's actually
[00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.120]   better they're able to pull that together for something so cheaply and
[00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:45.160]   people were very excited to see it I mean I tweeted when I got mine and I don't
[00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.720]   know how many hundred retweets I got out of that thing but yeah it is an
[00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:50.920]   interesting way to get VR and the hands of more people I mean people have
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:54.200]   certainly heard about VR for a long time not everyone has had the chance to try
[00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:57.160]   out Oculus and you know this isn't as good as Oculus but it certainly I think
[00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:01.200]   it's better than Oculus how's it not as good so here's a stare first of all
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:06.040]   Oculus well this is okay so it's using an Android phone apparently that's enough
[00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:11.200]   compute power to do what Oculus does this is this was the very fun thing they put
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:14.360]   out in the Moto X where it's a game where you look around and you follow a
[00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:19.520]   hat it's called windy day but if you put it in here and and you don't let your
[00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:22.960]   camera fall out yes you look around I wish you could see this but you're
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:26.640]   looking around you look down you look up there's the hat where to go wait a
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:30.640]   minute wait a minute wait a minute and it the accelerometer and the phone it
[00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:36.480]   works how big is that because Android phones vary so much in size yeah this is
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:40.360]   a five-inch this is the HTC one it's five inches but it would fiddle variety as
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:44.040]   you could see it's you know I don't think it would make the six inch it scales
[00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:48.280]   it scales because it's got little lenses and you know what how is it not as good
[00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:53.480]   as as Oculus Rift I don't think that the optical quality is quite as good as
[00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:57.040]   an Oculus given that it's dealing with multiple-sized phones and I think the
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:59.600]   lenses are a little bit cheaper but yeah I mean it's nine tenths of the way
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:03.640]   there for like instead of a small fraction of the cost it's got things
[00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:06.920]   you can ship somebody in the mail for you know a buck 25 and they can get a
[00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:09.600]   feel for what we are it's like yeah that should get excited about it who
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:12.880]   doesn't have an Android phone you could do this and somebody said well your
[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:15.560]   arms get tired well it'd be easy enough to just a glue a little rubber bit you
[00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:20.640]   know strap actually I have a real duct tape will work to put this on
[00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:25.920]   you're gonna get more grief from wearing that than wearing I just thought
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:29.360]   that's the best that's see Google's had problems because they give away such
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:32.000]   great stuff you know they give her thousands of dollars of this stuff last
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.520]   year that they that nobody can get any more they had to have a lottery to get
[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:38.840]   in I think half the people going there aren't developers they just want free
[00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:42.480]   crap so give away cardboard and maybe it'll be easier to get into developer
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:47.400]   conference and frankly this is giving me a lot of joy as you can see they
[00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:50.120]   don't want to free stuff but they wanted to protest one of the other but those
[00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:54.800]   are the two hot tickets cardboard or protesting yeah we noted that Google at
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:09:00.520]   the beginning of the of the I O keynote noted that 20% of the attendees of Google
[00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:04.200]   I owe this year were female but I want to point out the 50% of the protesters
[00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:10.480]   were female so there's still some catching up to do here's my Oculus Rift
[00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:18.040]   we got tweeted from let's see who is this G Rajib yeah on Twitter that the
[00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:23.120]   dodo case people yeah are making their own model and they're calling it the
[00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:29.520]   Google Cardboard VR toolkit for 1995 perfect not bad cheap and even events and
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:35.320]   there's no wires it's wireless they have a museum tour they have a tour of
[00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:40.200]   Versailles I mean I think I don't know I think this does everything the Oculus Rift
[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:44.600]   does anyway that's enough of that we'll talk about what Google announced to
[00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:47.560]   Google I owe because it's a kind of a mishmash and I want to get everybody
[00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:52.520]   to involved in that but before we do we should talk about the Supreme Court
[00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:58.400]   because those those the scotis was a little bit busy on Friday with two I
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:03.560]   think land well important rulings one maybe a landmark ruling but let's start
[00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:07.040]   with the less important ruling and that's the one that's got all the geeks a
[00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:12.280]   head up and that's the area ruling now Denise had a great this week in law on
[00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:19.480]   Friday discussing the area ruling and I certainly point you to that show if you
[00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:25.600]   want to really go into detail but let's it's called monkeys ducks and unicorns
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:30.960]   and one of your guests was Sonia West was from the University of Georgia right
[00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:35.600]   was yeah there's a little blah she was an expert on this whole issue but maybe
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:43.160]   Denise you can kind of summarize what did the Supreme Court rule well the
[00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:52.600]   Supreme Court tried to do something very limited I and say that somebody who is
[00:10:52.600 --> 00:11:00.360]   doing what Ariel does in the way Ariel does it is directly infringing copyright
[00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:08.120]   law by engaging in a public performance of the copyrighted works here the free
[00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:13.240]   over-the-air broadcast television that area was providing to its customers
[00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:20.720]   via its series of tiny dime size and tennis ABC had sued saying that area was
[00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:26.440]   illegally re-transmitting ABC television programming via the local
[00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:36.400]   television stations right ABC and other networks and it's been a very long and
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:44.520]   arduous and multi jurisdictional world of litigation around this issue because
[00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:51.000]   they always not the only company that has tried going after this using this
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.400]   kind of technology so we've had some conflicting decisions from around the
[00:11:55.400 --> 00:12:01.800]   country at the federal court level and what the Supreme Court was specifically
[00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:10.240]   looking at was an injunction against Ariel that was declined to be put in
[00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:15.920]   place by the New York federal court of appeal so the lower court said area was
[00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:20.000]   okay said area was okay for now doesn't need to be enjoined we're still gonna
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   have a trial on all these copyright issues but what you haven't done
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.480]   broadcasters is show a strong likelihood that you're gonna be able to demonstrate
[00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:36.800]   at trial that area directly infringed copyright and that's a big distinction
[00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:42.160]   whether area directly infringed or whether its users are somehow engaged in
[00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:47.320]   copyright infringement because you think back on the history of the kinds of
[00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:51.120]   copyright cases the Supreme Court has considered you think about the
[00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:58.680]   grokster case you think about the Betamax case way back then we're talking about
[00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:03.920]   things that could be copyright infringement by the users but the person
[00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:10.200]   supplying the intermediary technology may or may not be responsible for what
[00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:15.800]   the users are doing and here the direct question before the court was is there
[00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:21.360]   is area itself performing we know there's a performance going on of the
[00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:25.920]   copyrighted works that the broadcasters are putting out there but is Ariel doing
[00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:28.960]   that performance or is the performance happening on the viewer side and that
[00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:34.560]   turns out to be a very important distinction under copyright so the
[00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:39.720]   fact that area one this decision all that means does that mean now that the
[00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:43.600]   injunction that the injunction will be in effect it means that the area has to go
[00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:47.720]   back to the lower court means that area has to go back to the lower trials is
[00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:53.040]   still on there still will be a trial right right and under this decision from
[00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:57.960]   the Supreme Court there should be an injunction against areas the live
[00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:05.280]   broadcast the near live broadcast aspect of areas business and so area is just
[00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:10.960]   kind of unilaterally decided to suspend business which is sad because if they
[00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:17.280]   don't go ahead and litigate out the issues in this case we're not really
[00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:23.520]   going to reach the complicated nuances here that I think you know still need
[00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:30.000]   to be explored the Supreme Court looked way back to the late 60s and 70s before
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:36.840]   the 1976 copyright act and said basically the majority opinion authored by
[00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:42.240]   Justice Breyer said you know our hands are kind of tied because we had some
[00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:46.400]   opinions that we the Supreme Court our predecessors on the Supreme Court
[00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:51.680]   authored way back in the late 60s and the 1970s that looked at the community
[00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:59.680]   access television system the old cable system where people would put antennas
[00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:05.040]   on hills because people did not have good reception at their homes and not
[00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:10.080]   powerful enough amplified enough reception to really make use of free
[00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:14.640]   over-the-air broadcast television and we we had decided in a couple of those
[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:18.000]   decisions that there wasn't a public performance going on there wasn't a
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.680]   performance going on at all and you know what Congress did they came in in
[00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:29.120]   1976 and undit those decisions that gave the copyright owner exclusive right to
[00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:35.000]   perform the copyrighted work publicly right and they decided that cable
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:41.960]   companies were actually doing that and that if that's the case and then you know
[00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:45.560]   we you were talking before the show about now all the regulations and
[00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:50.720]   requirements that are incumbent on cable companies because of the role that they
[00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:56.520]   are playing in passing along the signal the free broadcast over the air television
[00:15:56.520 --> 00:16:02.760]   signal to their customers so the court went through some really strange
[00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:06.360]   machinations of you know just couldn't really I think get its head around
[00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:13.040]   areas technology very well or the fact that areas technology should be treated
[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:17.000]   different than an antenna on a hill so that's that's people are sharing that's
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.320]   point one and I mentioned before we began that I think my position on this is
[00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:26.160]   contrarian to what most geeks feel like and geeks love the area they love the
[00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:29.760]   idea of screwing the cable company screwing the networks with nobody loves
[00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:35.120]   either and why shouldn't we be able to pay bucks and be able to watch TV over
[00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:40.600]   the air using these antennas but it strikes me as areas doing exactly what
[00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:45.320]   the original cable system was supposed to do the cable which is why we heard so
[00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:49.720]   many of the dissent and most of the judges actually who ruled for this like
[00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:52.760]   Justice Sotomayor was saying like she kept scratching her head saying why is
[00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:56.120]   this not a cable company how is this not different cable company yeah right when
[00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:59.480]   if you really look into the technology clearly it's not a cable company I
[00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:03.920]   disagree I think it's exactly the same thing as community access television I
[00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:08.440]   think it's exactly the same thing original case now understand cable don't do it
[00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:11.920]   this way anymore but in the original days as as Denise was saying they put up an
[00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:15.360]   antenna because you couldn't get it and they ran a cable to your house and
[00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:19.920]   everybody who subscribed that cable company use that antenna is it but
[00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:23.400]   everybody didn't have their own antenna well first of all and your first of all
[00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:27.320]   I know this wasn't argue you have the same right to it to put in the way that
[00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:30.600]   you don't with a cable company it's it's a lot like a timeshare like those
[00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:34.400]   timeshare solar gardens that are popular these days first need to first
[00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:39.120]   the hardware what how does this change your argument if the dime size antennas
[00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:43.760]   are lies does this change your argument no no okay because I want to point out
[00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:47.880]   that antenna experts have said and I'll point you to this article from Pete
[00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:54.080]   Putman HD TV expert calm that in fact it's not possible that these dime size
[00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:58.400]   antennas could in fact effectively receive the transmissions they're too
[00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:03.960]   small they're probably acting as an array despite what area says now I admit
[00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:06.780]   this was not argued in court in fact what the court decided is we're not even to
[00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:10.520]   think about the technology let's just see the end result and I think the court
[00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:13.960]   probably was right because you could debate this issue the dime size antenna
[00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:18.080]   issue to the cows come home but they stipulated the area was telling the truth
[00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:22.080]   I don't think area was telling the truth the area is doing two things to get
[00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:25.960]   around the copyright act one is the dime size antennas two is a six second
[00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:31.480]   delay but in fact isn't it doing exactly the same thing as a cable company does
[00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:35.080]   really from the point of view of the user the point of view of everybody else
[00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:39.880]   well I've certainly the majority of the stream court felt that way that the I
[00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:46.720]   think they got it well reasoned Scalia dissent points out why we shouldn't
[00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:52.600]   consider it that way and Justice Scalia joined by Justice's Thomas
[00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:57.600]   and Alito the most conservative members of the court right exactly and I think
[00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:00.400]   they were giving a constructionist argument they I don't think that they
[00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:03.800]   were arguing in favor of the technology but they just were uncomfortable with a
[00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:08.320]   court overreaching and they were worried about the precedent in crowd
[00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:14.440]   computing in general because in this way we can call iTunes match a cable company
[00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:18.080]   if you and I just play the same album at the same time we're we're forgetting
[00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:22.960]   about the we paid for it and I do space for it it's yes there is and so I think
[00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:27.160]   Ariel gets around this and and knew it from the beginning by paying retransmission
[00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:32.680]   fees like a cable company and then it's all legal here's here's what Justice
[00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:36.520]   Scalia would say to you Leo he says I share the court's evident feeling that
[00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:40.600]   what area is doing or enabling to be done to the networks copyrighted programming
[00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:44.440]   ought not to be allowed but perhaps we need not distort the copyright act to
[00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:49.240]   forbid it as discussed at the outset areas secondary liability for for for
[00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:53.240]   performance infringement is yet to be determined if never even gotten to that
[00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:58.840]   issue in the case as is its primary and secondary liability for reproduction
[00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:02.680]   infringement if that does not suffice then assuming one shares the majority's
[00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:06.720]   estimation of right and wrong what we have before us must be considered a loophole
[00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:11.600]   in the law it is not the role of this court to identify and plug loopholes it
[00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:16.080]   is the role of good lawyers to identify and exploit them and the role of Congress
[00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:20.560]   to eliminate them if it wishes well it's a good that I may add in a much more
[00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:24.200]   targeted better informed and less disruptive fashion right then the crude
[00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:29.320]   looks like table TV solution the court invents today well it sounds like Justice
[00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:32.400]   Scalia Thomas and Alito merely said we shouldn't have taken this case in the
[00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:36.800]   first place right that's what they're saying or having taken it we shouldn't
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:43.360]   make a ruling I think having taken it we should we should find that there's no
[00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:47.600]   performance going on here is is what they would say under the technology that
[00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:51.480]   they're reviewing that justice the three dissenting justices rejected this whole
[00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:55.560]   notion that we can't look under the covers or behind the scenes and and that
[00:20:55.560 --> 00:21:00.240]   would be unimportant what's only important is the impact because in other
[00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:05.000]   cases we definitely use their experience yeah we definitely look at what the
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:10.920]   technology is doing in the cable vision case that blessed the notion of a remote
[00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:16.840]   DVR it the how the technology works was very important and whether the users
[00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:23.880]   were directing the performance I put myself in the in the in the position of
[00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:29.360]   the content creators the networks what if somebody were to take twit and
[00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:35.920]   rebroadcast it in some form charge people eight bucks to do it add to my
[00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:40.400]   audience great but in a way that I can't count and monetize it I would be pissed
[00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:45.800]   off and I think I would have a I would have a right to recourse doesn't
[00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:50.880]   don't these are plenty of podcast apps that maybe rebroadcaster they do and our
[00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:54.880]   rule with those like stitches a good example is they have to they cannot
[00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:59.920]   keep a copy of it on their servers they must merely provide an interface to our
[00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:05.640]   copy which we count so they don't cash our content they come they just provide
[00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:08.880]   an interface to get it which is fine with me because I can count it but if
[00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:12.800]   some but I've always had the rule that if somebody comes along and says and by
[00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:18.360]   the way there's that guy in LA who has that what is that bizarre business where
[00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:22.240]   he's rebroadcasting stuff completely illegally over the internet he
[00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:27.760]   rebroadcasts us it's my position that because I can't count that rebroadcast
[00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:34.520]   it's he's not his right to do that right and I think we're talking apples
[00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:37.880]   and oranges is that okay problem we're not talking about free over the air
[00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:42.120]   broadcast TV brought down by an antenna and whether it matters who has the
[00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:48.280]   antenna we're talking about something completely different a piece of video
[00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:53.240]   that you put out under a certain license and certain uses are allowed under that
[00:22:53.240 --> 00:23:00.120]   license you also make it embeddable via YouTube so you know being able to embed
[00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:06.600]   around the internet is is fine if you're doing it because I don't do it over the
[00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:11.440]   air for free it's not related it's not it's different I think it's different yes
[00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:16.480]   I think that one of the things the fact that film on TV and this guy I don't
[00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:22.000]   know why this guy's still in business rebroadcast twit and by the way
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.840]   everything else it looks like in the world he copies and rebroadcast or does
[00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:31.200]   he yeah copies and rebroadcast yeah so that's I think pretty clearly if you
[00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:34.960]   know I'm not here to give the network legal advice but I think if you consulted
[00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:40.040]   with a lawyer you might find that there that could well be actionable so the
[00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:44.920]   difference is because he copies and rebroadcast it because an area has always
[00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:49.600]   said this well we don't we just give we're all our businesses to rent in antenna
[00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:54.360]   right our business is to rent in antenna but isn't that what the cable
[00:23:54.360 --> 00:24:04.240]   companies business was it was but it was it was one antenna on a hill I see
[00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:11.200]   on the hill being shared by many and we're not talking about that situation
[00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:18.400]   here we're talking about much more I think the cable vision situation where
[00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:26.000]   was the particular user directing the particular recording on the remote DVR
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   that decision was never taken up by the Supreme Court they had the chance to
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:38.320]   decide that that was wrongly decided in one way and they didn't do that so it's
[00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:43.000]   still the law until the Supreme Court decides otherwise and I think they've
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:47.240]   they've kind you know the majority decision doesn't even really address
[00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:51.120]   that they may have monkeyed around with that and in fact went out of its way to
[00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:56.400]   say we're not touching the DVR aspect of areas business that's not in front of
[00:24:56.400 --> 00:25:01.960]   us right now but but I think you can't really get around the fact that their
[00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:08.680]   decision impacts not just remote DVR services but potentially thinks
[00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:13.880]   Professor Goldman has a great article on four unanswered questions that the
[00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:17.520]   area case leaves and one of those unanswered questions as well if we're
[00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:21.200]   not gonna look at how things work technologically and whether technologically
[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:26.560]   they comply with what we've decided is okay under the law or not then things
[00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:30.960]   like embedding could well be jeopardized you know it's hard to tell if that
[00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:36.520]   film on is embedding or copying you have to go behind the scenes and under the
[00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:40.160]   hood to figure that out and you know should it matter well the law has always
[00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:46.960]   said that it does so it's a dangerous precedent in that way I hate to get in
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:56.080]   bed with Scalia Alito embrace the Sicilian and Thomas and say that basically
[00:25:56.080 --> 00:26:01.880]   area is like a copy store with library cards yeah that's not the greatest
[00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:06.520]   analogy doesn't really I feel like if this is this is these are the guys we're
[00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:11.400]   gonna say oh they got it right huh Tim you haven't said a word what do you
[00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:15.480]   think well it's because I think Denise has got a pretty good lock on the situation
[00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:19.840]   you know my non-legal got instinct is that I tend to agree with the dissenting
[00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:24.080]   opinion here I mean I think it is a loophole that's being exploited by
[00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:27.600]   Ariel but I think that it is ultimately a loophole and you know I don't know where
[00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:30.480]   you draw the line if there's one antenna for me that somebody else is
[00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:33.440]   leasing to me and that's legal you know if there's two antennas that somebody
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:37.240]   else is leasing to two people that's legal you know at what point does it
[00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:41.120]   become illegal and of course as you mentioned if indeed this is all a bit of
[00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:44.040]   a lie and all those antennas are acting in series that that's a different story
[00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:48.680]   all together does that change things in my eye absolutely does yes at that
[00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:51.880]   point then there's no there's no doubt that they are breaking the law but you
[00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:56.880]   know taking things at face value and you know assuming that they're not lying to
[00:26:56.880 --> 00:27:01.280]   us then yeah I don't see why this would not be the same as just having a bunch
[00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:04.600]   of separate antennas and leasing those individually so I am a little bit
[00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:07.160]   disappointed by the ruling but ultimately I'm not surprised at all by
[00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:11.160]   the ruling that's this is pretty much how I expected it to go down so just we're
[00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:18.040]   gonna wrap it up but just to get clear in my mind Denise yeah if it's kind of
[00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:24.800]   like a hypothetical if what they were doing is just passing it on like they
[00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:29.040]   the the consumers choosing the channel the consumers choosing what to watch
[00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:36.240]   areas doing nothing but letting them do that and pass it on that would not be a
[00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:42.280]   public performance that would be legal no I don't think that's quite what the
[00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:47.760]   court in the majority decision said what what should it what did the court
[00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:51.280]   did the court give any direction area about how they could make this legal
[00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:59.160]   I know it did not really just looked at what it was doing and said you can't do
[00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:03.080]   that we think you're like a cable company and what you're doing is skirting
[00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:07.160]   the lot you know we had some cases on the books in the late 60s and the 70s that
[00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:11.680]   embraced what you were doing you know in the form of what the cable companies
[00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:16.760]   were doing that cable that cable that we think that Congress in 1976 expressly
[00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:20.600]   enacted they get go so far as to say we think that Congress enacted the 1976
[00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:25.240]   copyright act specifically to undo these two decisions that we that the
[00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:31.080]   Supreme Court had deciding that cable companies were not public publicly
[00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:37.360]   performing and it just decided so much that what Ariel was doing looked like
[00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:41.520]   what they were doing that that there it ought to be treated the same way and I
[00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:44.960]   think although this does not come through it is not expressly stated in the
[00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:48.600]   opinion I think there must have been some sort of underlying concern that if we
[00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:52.960]   go ahead and say that this is not a public performance then the cable
[00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:59.280]   companies all they have to do to get out from under all the must carry and
[00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:04.520]   retransmission fees and licensing consent requirements that they are under now
[00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:08.840]   the very heavily regulated industry that they are all they have to do is adopt an
[00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:14.600]   area like technology and they're golden they're they're no longer cable companies
[00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:20.480]   either and and I think the court was concerned about that kind of thing again
[00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:25.240]   this is just my guess on on that front in the oral arguments they were very
[00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:28.720]   concerned that whatever decision they made would impact services like Dropbox
[00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:31.520]   do you think that the decision they've made it I think you brought this up to
[00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:38.320]   Natalie the decision that they made now does put Dropbox in a tenuous position
[00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:43.680]   or no it protects drop asking me or not well I'll ask you Denise then I'll ask
[00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:47.560]   Natalie all right you're the lawyer we're gonna put you on the question I don't
[00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:53.560]   have the answer yeah I think the court is trying hard not to jeopardize services
[00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:59.400]   like Dropbox or Google Drive and to say hey if you're not dealing in free over
[00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:04.200]   the air broadcast television we don't apply this decision won't apply but I'm
[00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:07.720]   not quite sure and when you read through the dissent there are good
[00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:13.760]   arguments why it's difficult to draw lines you know it's it's gonna be fuzzy
[00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:20.440]   well as to what a public performance and as Justice Scalia says it looks like
[00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:25.840]   this standard will so confusion for years to come and I think that we will
[00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:30.200]   see some confusion around what constitutes a public performance after
[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:34.880]   this decision is what the Supreme Court's job is to try to infer what the intent
[00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:39.480]   of the of the legislation was and to enforce it in a way that's consistent
[00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:43.400]   with the legislation right I mean they're not overstepping their bounds that's
[00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:47.960]   what they do but they also know what they do is set precedences right which is
[00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:52.080]   why I think Scalia was so uncomfortable saying we're trying to ensure that this
[00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:56.800]   won't set a precedence but we cannot assure that right right and if Congress
[00:30:56.800 --> 00:31:02.400]   intends for things that aren't cable companies to be treated like cable
[00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:06.000]   companies should say Congress should say that they should say that not the not
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.960]   the court but this happens all the time the courts always making decisions about
[00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:16.120]   what it thinks Congress meant that's a lot of what the court does right yes Fox
[00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:19.600]   is already using areas defeat his ammunition against dish by the way they're
[00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:26.160]   revisiting a case they already lost saying but wait a minute maybe we shouldn't
[00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:30.720]   have lost this and they're going back to the court so this is just the beginning
[00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:35.680]   Fox's lawyer Richard Stone wrote a letter to the court saying dish which
[00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:39.120]   engages in virtually identical conduct when it streams Fox's program to
[00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:42.760]   dissubscribers over the internet has repeatedly raised the same defenses as
[00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:47.440]   Ario those defenses have now been rejected by the Supreme Court they're
[00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:56.000]   trying to have the case reheard I yeah okay a couple of things to point out yes
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:00.480]   of course Ario was trying to take advantages of loopholes you could call
[00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:04.080]   them loopholes or just the way the law was written they worked very hard when they
[00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:08.160]   first created the business to you know create a business that was legal that
[00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:14.240]   was based on the law and somebody some have said well that's wrong you know
[00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:17.640]   their intent was to circumvent but you know they try to use loopholes to get
[00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:21.200]   array with it but hey that's what happens every company does when they try
[00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:24.800]   to avoid paying taxes to you just you find the loopholes and you use them
[00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:29.920]   that's not illegal and and their intent with they the Supreme
[00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:33.760]   Court's not ruling on the intent of whether they intended to
[00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:40.400]   violate copyright right or are they well there is this volitional aspect to
[00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:45.760]   copyright infringement and it comes into play in the cable vision case and
[00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:50.880]   whether the user is doing the selecting or the intermediary
[00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:58.640]   technology entity so it comes into play there and if you're just
[00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:02.800]   passing through and allowing the user to do the selection you know I mean
[00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:05.840]   quarry whether it really makes sense to be able to
[00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:11.440]   go after all of Ario's users for copyright infringement but that's you
[00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:15.920]   know what we've seen in the movie industry in the music industry
[00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:22.000]   in other similar situations so so yeah you might find yourself in that
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:27.760]   kind of weird world but
[00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:33.360]   the other thing that could have put Ario on the hook getting back to
[00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:38.640]   direct liability or indirect liability is if it's inducing
[00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:44.880]   users to infringe and that's what did away with grokster right so grokster
[00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:48.400]   didn't infringe but because they gave users the ability to infringe and
[00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:52.960]   incented them to do so it was deemed illegal right so the direct
[00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:59.360]   infringement thing is is what's right really problematic here
[00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:02.720]   the other thing I think that comes up is that a lot of people are upset with
[00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:05.680]   the decision not on the law or the merits of the law
[00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:08.160]   whether the Supreme Court's right or wrong but just because they want
[00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:11.680]   it Ario to succeed I think that's the vast majority of geeks
[00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:14.800]   we just wanted this way to do this right
[00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:20.080]   Docs are also put up a good post today just sort of lamenting the fact that
[00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:24.240]   Ario did not position themselves differently in this case and did not
[00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:30.480]   come across not as the you know person providing you with a dime
[00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:34.000]   size or the company can provide you with the dime size antenna but
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:39.040]   instead the company providing you with the ability to actually receive free
[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:42.960]   over the air broadcast because as Doc writes in his post
[00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:47.360]   that's virtually impossible to do in a lot of places and
[00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:51.120]   Doc by the way agrees with me he says the court was right
[00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:54.080]   that Ario should have cleared performance rights with the stations
[00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:59.040]   and didn't but I think he makes the right case which is
[00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:03.600]   that Ario made the wrong case yeah Ario might might have wanted to
[00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:08.400]   do a little different kind of approach to what their business was
[00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:13.040]   yeah he says Ario is a perfect example of the marketplace at work
[00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:18.560]   after the digital TV transition Ario fulfilled a demand that existed
[00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:21.840]   because people couldn't could no longer get over the air signals
[00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:26.000]   right if the area met a market demand and that's that's
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:29.440]   how these things work I just I don't know that it would have done a lot of
[00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:33.360]   good because that's what the original cable deputies do did too and
[00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:38.560]   we're you know whether you should even consider Ario a cable company
[00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:43.360]   is is really the crux of this case I also think that and sometimes we in our
[00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:47.280]   zeal to get new technologies and to and to cut the cable
[00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:50.880]   and all of this we forget that people who create content
[00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:54.560]   do deserve to get paid for it do have rights to be protected that
[00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:57.840]   there's a reason why there are patents and copyrights these are not
[00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:01.360]   uniformly bad things in fact they're very good things and they do support
[00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:06.800]   innovation if you know innovation comes when you have a feeling that you can
[00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:10.080]   make them make some money on it that there's a reason for you to innovate
[00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:13.440]   not just because of hey it's a good thing I like to do this but because
[00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:16.160]   it's a business
[00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:20.720]   I don't know if Ario had partnered up with with Nielsen to be able to provide
[00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:24.560]   ratings and viewership numbers back to the broadcasters and effectively so
[00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:27.920]   that those eyes were counted that might have changed things a little bit
[00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:31.120]   because ultimately you know for over the air broadcast that's the only
[00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:33.680]   way that these companies really have an idea what people are watching
[00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:36.880]   cable they can get views obviously and through streaming networks they can
[00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:39.280]   of course know what's going on but beyond that it's pretty much
[00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:42.560]   reliant on Nielsen numbers and and I wonder if they had done something
[00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:45.280]   there so those numbers got back so the advertisers are like this would know
[00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:48.080]   what's going on that might have helped the case a little bit I think I think
[00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:52.800]   frankly if Ario had gone to the locals and said we want
[00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:56.640]   read we want to retransmit do you give us permission this is what a cable
[00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:58.640]   company does do you give us permission and the
[00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:02.240]   and the locals say yeah but you got to pay me a 10 cents a subscriber
[00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:04.960]   and agreed to that admittedly they wouldn't have had an eight dollar a
[00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:09.680]   month service but they would also be legal and I feel like that
[00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:15.040]   Ario really set us up said no you can have an eight dollar a
[00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:19.600]   month service you just we just do these things and magically it's legal
[00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:23.520]   and they've been proven wrong so for people to get upset
[00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:26.960]   well now you're getting into economics though because what is the cost is
[00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:30.640]   definitely not what we pay our cable companies that is not the cost we pay
[00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:34.720]   for a lot of things we do not consume and so the cost is
[00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:37.680]   if i'm talking on behalf of the user inflated
[00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:40.240]   um but you're right it's not eight dollars a month
[00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:43.600]   and it's not 60 like the real cost somewhere between there i could assume
[00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:47.040]   is somewhere in between well then in fact that was an opportunity for Ario
[00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:51.120]   then yeah i think so too price it right pay the transmission
[00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:55.200]   retransmission fees but still if still be less than cable
[00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:59.840]   and maybe you know i don't know i just i i do feel like like
[00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:05.200]   Ario there was a wink wink nudge nudge in Ario's business model
[00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:08.640]   right i don't know i kind of middle i kind of feel like
[00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:11.680]   justice brier what we're talking about we're not going to look at what happened
[00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:16.400]   behind the scenes it's kind of like saying we're not going to look at right
[00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:20.480]   they're trying to end run no no and he was right not to that's probably right
[00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:23.280]   the court should probably not do that because that's hard to determine
[00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:26.000]   somebody's intent
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:29.360]   no i meant technologically behind the scenes right oh and i think that was also
[00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:32.480]   right because yeah that they would have gotten in the weeds they don't have all
[00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:35.680]   day to do this they got a lot of work to do yeah
[00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:39.360]   they're trying to get the conversation right right they want to go into a case
[00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:44.320]   they only have october to july they got stuff to do they got some
[00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:46.960]   fishing working up against a break that's why we got two big
[00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:52.800]   rulings like all right i was not agreed but we got to get out of here so
[00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:57.280]   i think i frankly don't think the area case matters all that much because
[00:38:57.280 --> 00:39:01.920]   it seems to me in five years sooner or later everything will be on the
[00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:05.840]   internet that's where it's going this is these last gasp
[00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:08.880]   lawsuits are merely an attempt to kind of keep the business model going a little
[00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:12.080]   bit longer but just as with everything else it's all going to be on the
[00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:15.360]   internet none of this is going to matter in the long run
[00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:20.960]   um this is a short-term problem area was solving a short-term issue
[00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:25.760]   um and am i wrong on this i mean i understand that cable companies and
[00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:28.080]   television companies are going kicking and screaming
[00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:33.040]   but at some point sooner than later it's going to all be on the internet
[00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:35.760]   yeah it's just a question of what's going to cost
[00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:40.640]   right and uh well that's why comcast is doing what it's doing to
[00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:45.280]   to become the evil empire because they want to make sure that if they can't
[00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:48.800]   charge you for hbo and showtime and a package of stuff just so you can watch
[00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:52.240]   the world cup at least they can charge you the through the wazoo for your
[00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:56.320]   internet access and and notice by the way if you look at the pricing
[00:39:56.320 --> 00:40:00.160]   the pricing of cable with internet cable without internet cable tv with
[00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:04.000]   internet cable without internet has come closer and closer and closer
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:07.760]   the differential is very small and it's getting smaller all the time
[00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:09.920]   because they know eventually they're not going to be able to charge you for
[00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:12.880]   television but they're going to get it out of you for cable for internet
[00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:16.960]   rather yeah are we all in agreement that
[00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:20.400]   Tim do you agree that uh what do you what's the time frame you think before all
[00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:24.960]   content is on the internet period yeah i would say five years might even be
[00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:28.080]   a bit pessimistic but yes certainly in the very near future at least you
[00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:31.520]   know here in the united states anyway i i think that within probably two or
[00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:36.320]   three years we'll see all but very fringe content uh you know like rfd tv which
[00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:39.280]   has cattle auctions and things like that i'll take a little bit longer to get
[00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:42.320]   over cattle auctions the first thing that should go on the internet
[00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:45.440]   i actually used to enjoy that channel when i when i got it brought me back
[00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:48.480]   come to petalowal we got a auction house right up here yeah it's great
[00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:54.080]   they know i look finer i assume you're meeting legally on the internet
[00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:57.200]   say yeah legally on the other that's that's true legally in an authorized
[00:40:57.200 --> 00:41:02.240]   oh yeah of course fashion everything can be gotten on the internet right now
[00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:08.000]   but what but legitimately legally with the sanction of the content creators
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.720]   yeah i say three four years in the outside yeah yeah
[00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:15.120]   and when the content creators then break the model so that you can subscribe to
[00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:18.240]   one channel without all of the rest of them because that's what really pisses
[00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:22.800]   us off so much about the cable companies is not so much their service or lack
[00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:27.040]   thereof but paying for things that we don't consume and wanting to
[00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:30.480]   you know buy a cable package that doesn't include whatever that
[00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:34.720]   channel you just were talking about horse whatever horse options
[00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:39.120]   no i i think truthfully the real the real people behind this the ones
[00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:41.920]   who are most concerned about area were the cable companies
[00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:45.440]   because what they you know it's not yes it was the content creators
[00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:48.400]   suing but i think the cable companies do not want this to change
[00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:52.880]   they need to proceed preserve their power as long as possible
[00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:57.120]   otherwise hbo and espn and everybody else just go directly to the consumers
[00:41:57.120 --> 00:41:59.840]   and say pay us ten bucks a month for hbo go
[00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:04.240]   disintermediate Comcast who needs them right and the other reason they don't do
[00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:08.960]   that's they're terrified of Comcast right they can't afford yet to do that
[00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:12.880]   then you get into the legal issues around those aggregating
[00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:17.120]   the you know wild and woolly world of disaggregated
[00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:20.800]   everything on the internet that's the way it should be bundled for you and
[00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:24.640]   someone tries to bundle it that was google tv's issue right that you were
[00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:28.880]   going to be able to select your cbs and they didn't like that
[00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:33.120]   bc online uh no they didn't like that at all
[00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:38.240]   i should be able to buy forget channels i should be able to buy game of thrones
[00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:40.560]   i shouldn't have to buy hbo i shouldn't have to buy a package for
[00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:42.800]   Comcast i should be able to buy game of thrones
[00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:46.720]   and you know what when that happens it won't be hbo that's producing it
[00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:51.200]   it'll be you can though you can buy it by episode two a year later
[00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:55.600]   right but what's happening and i think the music industry realized this is
[00:42:55.600 --> 00:42:59.520]   who you're competing against is bit torrent the real competitor
[00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:03.360]   is bit torrent because they're offering it for free and high quality the minute
[00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:09.840]   the show ends illegal obviously right
[00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:12.960]   all right we're going to take a break because there was a i think much more
[00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:16.640]   important supreme court decision regarding cell phone searches and
[00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:20.000]   again we'll go to our legal beagle

[00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:23.120]   good job
[00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:27.200]   so uh... at the same exact time as they released the area of decision they
[00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:30.080]   released the cell phone decision
[00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:33.520]   and i think this is uh... very good news
[00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:38.320]   for privacy in this country even if you have been arrested
[00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:41.840]   the police still must seek in most cases
[00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:43.760]   a warrant before they can
[00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:45.680]   search your cell phone
[00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:49.280]   and we know law enforcement actually has boxes they could plug into your phone
[00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:53.760]   and dump all the data off of it and they do often routinely do that
[00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:57.440]   but the supreme court ruled wednesday that this is you got to get a warrant
[00:46:57.440 --> 00:46:59.600]   is that is that good
[00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:03.840]   Denise oh it's fabulous yes riley versus california is the case
[00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:07.200]   unanimous decision of the supreme court
[00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:10.880]   uh... which you know you get a lot of court watchers saying
[00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:15.120]   what that means and if it's really in truly unanimous or
[00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:18.720]   if you suggest leo there they're just
[00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:24.080]   we went and deal in behind the scenes i'll trade you an area for a cell phone
[00:47:24.080 --> 00:47:29.920]   yeah right but uh... yes um here we have the court actually uh
[00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:34.160]   really showing a good grasp of what
[00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:38.000]   new technologies mean and how they impact people's lives and
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:41.680]   uh... the difference between being able to search someone's pocket
[00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:44.960]   or a weapon or something else that might hurt
[00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:49.200]   uh... an officer during an arrest or something else that might be
[00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:52.080]   informationally important to the arrest
[00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:55.280]   uh... evidence that you could gather just by
[00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:56.240]   uh... you know
[00:47:56.240 --> 00:48:00.160]   you know exactly now you're gonna you're gonna find lots of evidence on
[00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:03.040]   somebody's phone but it's gonna be stuff that uh...
[00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:06.560]   not only could convict them that is gonna be a lot of other stuff too
[00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:10.400]   so the case was a guy who stopped for traffic violation
[00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:13.760]   they uh... i guess must have given the probable cause
[00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:17.440]   seen weapons they would see he was arrested on weapons charges
[00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:22.240]   the officers searching him seized a phone from his pants pocket
[00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:26.320]   the officer accessed information on the phone notice the repeated use of a term
[00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:30.240]   associated with a street gang at the police station two hours later a
[00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:34.480]   detective specializing in gangs further examined the phone's contents
[00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:38.640]   based on photographs and videos the detective found the state charged
[00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:41.680]   the petitioner in connection with a shooting that occurred a few weeks
[00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:46.400]   earlier and sought and enhance sentence based on gang membership
[00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:48.080]   uh...
[00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:51.280]   he was he was uh... convicted
[00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:55.280]   then appealed california court of appeals affirmed
[00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:58.640]   but the california supreme court and the california supreme court but uh... not
[00:48:58.640 --> 00:49:02.320]   the united states supreme court unanimously they said
[00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:05.520]   that was unlawful search and seizure
[00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:09.360]   so what do we need to do now as uh...
[00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:13.840]   uh... citizens if we are stopped by the police and they say can i have your
[00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:15.400]   phone
[00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:17.040]   should we just say no
[00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:20.160]   uh... yeah you can you can ask me right in front of them
[00:49:20.160 --> 00:49:24.560]   i'll say you know in riley versus state of california
[00:49:24.560 --> 00:49:27.480]   smashing it you can you eat the phone
[00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:31.040]   you could have obstruction charges against you and are those kinds of
[00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:32.520]   circumstances that either
[00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:36.840]   but uh... yeah without a warrant they can't search your plan so if you've done
[00:49:36.840 --> 00:49:39.360]   something wrong give them the phone
[00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:42.800]   let's say officer no you're not allowed to search that but here
[00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:44.960]   and then they'll throw the whole thing at a court
[00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:49.440]   just justice robert's wrote modern cell phones i love this are not just
[00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:53.920]   another technological convenience with all they contain and all they may reveal
[00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:55.760]   they hold for many americans
[00:49:55.760 --> 00:49:58.040]   the privacy's of life
[00:49:58.040 --> 00:50:01.480]   fact that technology now allows an individual to carry this in his hand is
[00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:03.520]   not make the information
[00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:06.280]   any less worthy of protection
[00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:08.480]   i love that that's right on
[00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:11.840]   and also like how he said that the term so phone itself is pretty much outdated
[00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:15.320]   and then be that these are affected cameras or journals or
[00:50:15.320 --> 00:50:18.880]   you know any sort of thing that should and is normally picked up by law and i
[00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:20.760]   thought that was a great point that he made as well
[00:50:20.760 --> 00:50:25.080]   so this is the according to the daily dot this review for verses of five decades
[00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:28.320]   old interpretation of the law that allowed arresting officers
[00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:31.240]   to search suspects pockets phones and anything else
[00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:33.320]   within his or her reach
[00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:37.320]   so it's this is this is kind of new law
[00:50:37.320 --> 00:50:38.240]   yes
[00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:40.560]   are allowed to be there were
[00:50:40.560 --> 00:50:45.840]   yeah and they can they can still you know the seat of your car your pocket
[00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:46.520]   uh...
[00:50:46.520 --> 00:50:52.240]   they can pat you down you know if if the safety concern of the officers is all
[00:50:52.240 --> 00:50:54.120]   always been behind
[00:50:54.120 --> 00:50:58.480]   and you can go ahead and do a search incident to arrest but if you're going
[00:50:58.480 --> 00:51:00.360]   to search a cell phone this
[00:51:00.360 --> 00:51:05.000]   decision says you're going to need to get a warrant and and law enforcement was
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:09.400]   uh... not wild about this decision and and fought it because they said well
[00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:12.120]   particularly in today's day and age
[00:51:12.120 --> 00:51:14.760]   getting warrants not going to be effective because
[00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:18.120]   uh... what if someone just you know you've got apple they've got this great
[00:51:18.120 --> 00:51:20.480]   remote wife androids does it too
[00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:23.680]   uh... we're gonna have our evidence destroyed
[00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:25.960]   and and the court you know really
[00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:30.440]   showed a nice grass not only of the nature of the cell phone but of of how
[00:51:30.440 --> 00:51:32.960]   these things work in the decision
[00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:36.800]   uh... it talks about uh... as to remote wiping
[00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:40.680]   uh... their means to address that yet first of all you could turn the phone
[00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:42.920]   off then it can't be wiped
[00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:45.480]   that in mind like forceman officers
[00:51:45.480 --> 00:51:49.200]   and also you could use a fair day bag would you ever have expected to have
[00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:53.800]   one of their fair day bag in a u_s_ supreme court decision they know such
[00:51:53.800 --> 00:51:55.480]   a thing exists is awesome
[00:51:55.480 --> 00:51:59.400]   obviously was some smart clerk right who wrote this is such devices are
[00:51:59.400 --> 00:52:03.680]   commonly called fair day bags of the english scientist michael fair day
[00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:08.440]   they are essentially sandwich bags made of aluminum foil cheap lightweight and
[00:52:08.440 --> 00:52:11.780]   easy to use and it's show you to then then they cite the
[00:52:11.780 --> 00:52:15.760]   well of the criminal law professors that was uh... filed as an amicus brief so
[00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:18.840]   they're reading their briefs and they know what this stuff is or or a clerk is
[00:52:18.840 --> 00:52:23.120]   yes yes they made this may not be a complete answer to the problem but at
[00:52:23.120 --> 00:52:27.720]   least for now they provide a reasonable response and they they talk about
[00:52:27.720 --> 00:52:31.960]   and that not only the law enforcement agencies uh... know what fair day bags
[00:52:31.960 --> 00:52:35.160]   are and use them and encourage officers to use them but they talk about the
[00:52:35.160 --> 00:52:39.160]   fact that a warrant a lot easier to get than it used to be to and that
[00:52:39.160 --> 00:52:40.320]   unfortunately
[00:52:40.320 --> 00:52:44.760]   that a lot of lot of law enforcement officers can talk about you know can
[00:52:44.760 --> 00:52:49.000]   rely on like a fifteen minute electronic email response
[00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:53.040]   to request for a warrant so we're not talking about a whole lot of hoops
[00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:55.040]   that need to be jumped through here
[00:52:55.040 --> 00:52:59.000]   the the daily dot says in answer the question what should you do lock your
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:01.160]   phone with a passcode
[00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:04.560]   uh... if your phone is locked and or encrypted according to the aclu the
[00:53:04.560 --> 00:53:07.640]   police may take your phone they try to look at it on constitutionally but they
[00:53:07.640 --> 00:53:09.480]   won't be able to
[00:53:09.480 --> 00:53:13.280]   the campwell to put your finger on the it did it
[00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:16.280]   if you forgot to lock your phone and don't feel like it then calmly and
[00:53:16.280 --> 00:53:17.840]   respectfully
[00:53:17.840 --> 00:53:19.000]   this will work
[00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:22.360]   tell the officer is searches in violation of the constitution
[00:53:22.360 --> 00:53:26.560]   under the courts rightly decision
[00:53:26.560 --> 00:53:30.840]   yeah i mean they that daily dot article date has some great advice about saying
[00:53:30.840 --> 00:53:31.760]   look
[00:53:31.760 --> 00:53:36.000]   uh... if you want to search my phone you need a warrant for that if they want to
[00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:37.680]   go ahead though and do it
[00:53:37.680 --> 00:53:38.960]   that same article says
[00:53:38.960 --> 00:53:42.760]   just go ahead and let them do it you know what the lies
[00:53:42.760 --> 00:53:46.440]   but you should out loud state i do not consent to this search
[00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:48.760]   and make sure the witnesses here i do not
[00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:51.840]   want to make this clear i do not consent to this search because then the
[00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:54.800]   whatever they find is uh... in a missile
[00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:57.760]   i got a good question from someone on twitter along these lines his name was
[00:53:57.760 --> 00:53:58.800]   marked jones
[00:53:58.800 --> 00:54:02.680]   and he was sort of keying into the fact that not only you know do we keep
[00:54:02.680 --> 00:54:06.360]   everything on our cell phones but we have things like boarding passes and in
[00:54:06.360 --> 00:54:08.200]   his particular case i guess
[00:54:08.200 --> 00:54:10.160]   his insurance card
[00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:14.840]   for you know showing that he has uh... auto insurance on his cell phone
[00:54:14.840 --> 00:54:19.040]   uh... and asking if you show that to an officer on your phone are you giving up
[00:54:19.040 --> 00:54:21.800]   your privacy rights to anything else on the phone i i certainly
[00:54:21.800 --> 00:54:23.960]   don't think so
[00:54:23.960 --> 00:54:24.960]   uh...
[00:54:24.960 --> 00:54:27.360]   you know first of all you have to be
[00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:28.320]   if you're
[00:54:28.320 --> 00:54:32.280]   under arrest is the only way that that there could even be an issue about an
[00:54:32.280 --> 00:54:35.600]   officer's ability to search your phone without a warrant
[00:54:35.600 --> 00:54:42.200]   uh... and just handing an officer an unlocked phone to show a particular item
[00:54:42.200 --> 00:54:46.680]   on there i don't think is communicating consent to search the phone but again
[00:54:46.680 --> 00:54:49.120]   you might want to say when you're handing the phone over
[00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:52.720]   hey i don't consent to you searching the whole phone also might mention that the
[00:54:52.720 --> 00:54:56.360]   electronic frontier foundation and the a_c_l_ you have pages called know your
[00:54:56.360 --> 00:54:58.080]   rights where you could print
[00:54:58.080 --> 00:54:59.920]   a p_d_f_
[00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:04.120]   about what the police can and cannot do i presume updated thanks to this most
[00:55:04.120 --> 00:55:05.480]   recent decision and
[00:55:05.480 --> 00:55:07.760]   uh... also p_d_f_ of tips
[00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:09.200]   when confronted by the police
[00:55:09.200 --> 00:55:11.920]   the thing i want to emphasize this is not
[00:55:11.920 --> 00:55:16.720]   designed to you know somehow get gang members off
[00:55:16.720 --> 00:55:18.720]   because the police do have
[00:55:18.720 --> 00:55:22.520]   the ability to ask for a warrant to put thing in a fair day box
[00:55:22.520 --> 00:55:26.360]   there's a lot you know it's it's you know if they're really is a crime
[00:55:26.360 --> 00:55:28.280]   the police can pursue it
[00:55:28.280 --> 00:55:32.320]   this is to protect our privacy against an overreaching
[00:55:32.320 --> 00:55:34.600]   uh... police stay
[00:55:34.600 --> 00:55:36.880]   and uh... this is good tips for talking to the police
[00:55:36.880 --> 00:55:38.520]   i hope it's
[00:55:38.520 --> 00:55:43.520]   there's a great long youtube video by you should never ever talk to the police
[00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:45.680]   uh...
[00:55:45.680 --> 00:55:50.840]   that i i i i i i i refer you to without recommending it i refer you to if you
[00:55:50.840 --> 00:55:52.120]   want to know more
[00:55:52.120 --> 00:55:55.080]   i certainly make sure my kids know
[00:55:55.080 --> 00:55:58.600]   uh... so good news privacy rights protected and what do you think that in
[00:55:58.600 --> 00:56:00.880]   the in the in the light of these two
[00:56:00.880 --> 00:56:02.000]   decisions
[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:05.400]   lot of people were mocking the supreme court in the area case saying all the
[00:56:05.400 --> 00:56:07.920]   clearly technologically out of touch
[00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:11.480]   i actually thought in the oral arguments uh... most of them not all of them but
[00:56:11.480 --> 00:56:14.280]   most of them were pretty in touch so my art showed a real
[00:56:14.280 --> 00:56:17.800]   understanding of how this stuff works i think she knew about roku boxes in
[00:56:17.800 --> 00:56:19.880]   that flex
[00:56:19.880 --> 00:56:23.080]   uh... so i think that in this in this privacy thing they seem very much in
[00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:24.160]   touch
[00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:26.640]   with what a cell phone is and uh...
[00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:31.520]   and why it's important that they seem like they are in touch is Denise
[00:56:31.520 --> 00:56:35.640]   yeah i i think they're more in touch than people give them credit for i do
[00:56:35.640 --> 00:56:36.520]   think
[00:56:36.520 --> 00:56:38.520]   you know you're talking about
[00:56:38.520 --> 00:56:40.440]   people in an older
[00:56:40.440 --> 00:56:42.120]   demographic
[00:56:42.120 --> 00:56:47.120]   you're still you know incorporating these tools in their own life and trying to
[00:56:47.120 --> 00:56:48.760]   grasp what
[00:56:48.760 --> 00:56:50.760]   how they work and what they mean and
[00:56:50.760 --> 00:56:54.200]   uh... doing their best with it and they have really smart clerks as you
[00:56:54.200 --> 00:56:56.080]   pointed out leo so
[00:56:56.080 --> 00:57:00.560]   uh... they i think they they do a pretty darn good job uh...
[00:57:00.560 --> 00:57:01.360]   you know
[00:57:01.360 --> 00:57:03.560]   the copy shop with the library card
[00:57:03.560 --> 00:57:06.000]   that's so is something a
[00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:09.160]   cable company when it's clearly not
[00:57:09.160 --> 00:57:14.000]   uh... they've they've got some hurdles to overcome still and it would be wonderful
[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:16.200]   if we could get someone you know
[00:57:16.200 --> 00:57:17.480]   truly
[00:57:17.480 --> 00:57:22.280]   versed in what technology means and and how it works and the legal
[00:57:22.280 --> 00:57:26.720]   considerations around it on the court i i think we're still waiting for that one
[00:57:26.720 --> 00:57:29.280]   it's been you know kind of uh...
[00:57:29.280 --> 00:57:32.200]   a truism in technology for years that
[00:57:32.200 --> 00:57:33.880]   legislatures
[00:57:33.880 --> 00:57:35.880]   uh... courts
[00:57:35.880 --> 00:57:38.000]   members of congress don't really understand
[00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:40.480]   modern tech the modern world
[00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:44.440]   but i think as as the uh... as the older generation ages out in the new or
[00:57:44.440 --> 00:57:46.920]   younger people get elected in appointed
[00:57:46.920 --> 00:57:48.840]   skit better
[00:57:48.840 --> 00:57:51.200]   that's getting better and it's getting different
[00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:54.320]   you know i i'd keep coming back i have a ten year old so
[00:57:54.320 --> 00:57:58.640]   i see the world of minecraft sort of constantly
[00:57:58.640 --> 00:58:00.240]   that's a very different world
[00:58:00.240 --> 00:58:04.200]   it is isn't it and and the whole approach to the intellectual property in
[00:58:04.200 --> 00:58:06.040]   minecraft is is
[00:58:06.040 --> 00:58:09.520]   completely you know just not something i think the supreme court would be able
[00:58:09.520 --> 00:58:12.320]   to get their head around what do you mean people just create worlds and then
[00:58:12.320 --> 00:58:15.480]   everybody gets to use them and there's no copyright and there's no
[00:58:15.480 --> 00:58:16.680]   enforcement and
[00:58:16.680 --> 00:58:19.040]   so yeah i think we're seeing a generational
[00:58:19.040 --> 00:58:20.560]   chaps
[00:58:20.560 --> 00:58:25.520]   i do dread the day then everything is an eight-bit minecraft
[00:58:25.520 --> 00:58:28.400]   so your kids like cuz because michael just like you won't stop playing
[00:58:28.400 --> 00:58:29.920]   minecraft you love minecraft

[00:58:36.440 --> 00:58:39.000]   that's a fan
[00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:42.280]   all right we have specific questions for chad when you have a chance
[00:58:42.280 --> 00:58:45.880]   that yet chads the king of minecraft obviously on g_craft
[00:58:45.880 --> 00:58:49.120]   we're gonna take a break and we're done with the supreme court thank you
[00:58:49.120 --> 00:58:51.720]   supreme court for giving us a lot of material they but there's a lot more to
[00:58:51.720 --> 00:58:53.880]   talk about including google i_o_
[00:58:53.880 --> 00:58:56.960]   uh... apple microsoft and amazon

[00:58:59.480 --> 00:59:03.360]   uh... and i really want to talk about this face book study which apparently i'm
[00:59:03.360 --> 00:59:05.160]   the only person upset about
[00:59:05.160 --> 00:59:09.320]   the fact that face book tried to manipulate our emotions for one week
[00:59:09.320 --> 00:59:11.360]   in a two years ago
[00:59:11.360 --> 00:59:14.800]   but that's going to all have to wait till after this break these how is here

[00:59:40.320 --> 00:59:42.800]   i just thought it was an eight bit problem
[00:59:42.800 --> 00:59:44.960]   all right
[00:59:44.960 --> 00:59:46.400]   uh...

[01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:40.920]   to it i know people who would would how many
[01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:44.560]   we seem to get lots of nature box deliveries are stat we feed our staff
[01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:45.480]   snacks
[01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:47.240]   we get three months
[01:02:47.240 --> 01:02:49.000]   we might have to increase it yeah
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:52.280]   we give our snack i mean i think this is good i remember it was a big deal at
[01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:55.720]   tech tv when they cut out the oatmeal
[01:02:55.720 --> 01:03:01.000]   that was like the end of the world we knew that the business was going down
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:04.840]   because we used to have the cups you know of the of oatmeal and hot water and
[01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:09.000]   and i think half the staff was living on that oatmeal rent stuff in san francisco
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.520]   and when they still have the bisque off spread
[01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:12.760]   do we all
[01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:14.560]   that should be banned
[01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:16.440]   that stuff should be made illegal
[01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:18.200]   that can't be good for you
[01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:19.080]   what is it
[01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:21.360]   ground-up this cough cookies
[01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:24.360]   they turn this i don't know if you have this got there's a good like
[01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:26.920]   orios but better right
[01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:29.880]   yet another no i think you should give me a good way and i don't know if they
[01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:31.560]   still do their call the stuff
[01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:32.560]   this call
[01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:34.160]   and then somebody
[01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:37.000]   said hey you know what if we grind this like we've got peanuts you could make a
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.400]   this cough butter
[01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:41.240]   if you've ever had it
[01:03:41.240 --> 01:03:42.640]   don't if you haven't because
[01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:46.240]   you won't be able to stop you will crave bisque off butter for the rest of your
[01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:47.680]   life it's terrible
[01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:50.760]   and if all those people in the studio should run right now to the fridge and
[01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:54.920]   start passing the biscuit
[01:03:54.920 --> 01:03:55.520]   you can
[01:03:55.520 --> 01:03:57.440]   european cookie spread
[01:03:57.440 --> 01:03:58.360]   yeah
[01:03:58.360 --> 01:04:01.800]   yeah i think jeff needles ate it all
[01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:04.960]   all right now he doesn't like he only eats
[01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:07.960]   chicken unskinned chicken breasts and
[01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:10.520]   what is their vegetable you like
[01:04:10.520 --> 01:04:12.040]   zucchini that's right
[01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:15.160]   he actually found a chicken and zucchini cookbook and everything he eats
[01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:16.760]   everything in that book
[01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:18.680]   that's it he's a strange boy
[01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:20.280]   uh...
[01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:21.440]   needles
[01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:23.240]   alright
[01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:26.640]   uh... google i_o_ i already showed off the best part of google i_o_ which is
[01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:29.920]   the cardboard box you're right i found the dodo case thing to him this is so
[01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:31.680]   cool
[01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:36.120]   dodo case which makes those great i-pad cases is is selling a google cardboard
[01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:37.400]   v_r_ toolkit
[01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:39.040]   for twenty bucks
[01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:42.840]   or add the n_f_c_ tag which is in that useful for five bucks more
[01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:46.120]   but what it does is when you put your phone in there the n_f_c_ tag goes
[01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:48.920]   and it launches the cardboard app automatically
[01:04:48.920 --> 01:04:51.800]   and i would be surprised to receive some better made plastic ones here in a
[01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:52.960]   couple weeks
[01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:57.120]   uh... this could you turn into something of uh... you know uh... an app marketplace
[01:04:57.120 --> 01:05:00.120]   almost i mean i could see devs uh... starting to develop games for the sort of
[01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:02.880]   system that you'd why not
[01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:06.640]   is that the funniest thing in the world of google does all this stuff
[01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:11.520]   and like spends billions of dollars to do robots autonomous vehicles in balloons
[01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:12.560]   with the internet
[01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:15.360]   and it turns out a cardboard box
[01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:17.960]   is their hottest product
[01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:20.520]   that would be fitting with it
[01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:24.520]   well you know the i_p_ lawyer in me is just cringing at the fact that i'm already
[01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:28.920]   duplicated the cardboard box and is using the google trademark in
[01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:32.360]   oh my god will we see a supreme court case
[01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:34.360]   uh...
[01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:39.840]   it's the minecraft world and and google will decline to enforce it seems like
[01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:41.680]   they don't really
[01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:43.320]   uh...
[01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:46.880]   so uh... you went to google i_o_ tim stevens i know
[01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:47.760]   and it
[01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:49.720]   and uh...
[01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:52.880]   i guess the the thing they handed out of google i_o_
[01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:57.800]   was an android where watch each other to the same song of the l_g_ and then
[01:05:57.800 --> 01:06:00.960]   later you'll get the moto 360 so which one did you get
[01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:04.000]   uh... i would be the same song which is here i was kind of curious to see what
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:08.320]   same song would do in in the long term of what the device in some said during i_o_
[01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:11.360]   that they're going to differentiate their device a little bit more right now all
[01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:13.960]   three devices do basically the same thing
[01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:17.000]   which is enjoyed where notifications plus heart rate and some of the stuff
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.800]   uh... since i did say they bring some of their functionality to this device and i
[01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:22.480]   did like the look of the same song a little bit better the lg's is more
[01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:25.720]   square more blockish it looks bigger even though the same size
[01:06:25.720 --> 01:06:28.840]   that the tapered bezel on the same song i think looks a little bit nicer so
[01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:31.360]   i went with this guy but ultimately in terms of functionality at least they're
[01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:32.480]   very very similar
[01:06:32.480 --> 01:06:35.400]   and vice-versary that's actually one thing i found very interesting it was ours
[01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:38.360]   technical quoting that googles head of engineering
[01:06:38.360 --> 01:06:42.920]   that they are going to unlike with the and right phones
[01:06:42.920 --> 01:06:44.240]   and right where
[01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:46.440]   and read car and red t_v_
[01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:49.840]   would all be exactly the same
[01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:54.160]   and without in particular you have very little control and right on over the
[01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:56.800]   the look and feel of your apps that's by design
[01:06:56.800 --> 01:07:00.160]   uh... i spoke with folks from general is and and outy to get a little bit more
[01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:02.000]   information on that but ultimately you know
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.600]   when you are talking about something that you use what you're driving is very
[01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:06.880]   important that not to be distracting
[01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:09.000]   so google worked very closely with those are
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:12.680]   on manufacturers and with others to design a look and feel for the interface
[01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:14.240]   that's going to be consistent
[01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:16.680]   is going to be the kind of thing that you can extend a little bit but
[01:07:16.680 --> 01:07:19.600]   ultimately they're not going to give developers the opportunity to change
[01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:22.320]   the look and feel as a so if you go between spotify
[01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:25.600]   and play music for example the absolute exactly the same except the colors
[01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:27.320]   change and the local change
[01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:29.720]   so all the all the developers can really do their is basically change the
[01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:33.000]   orientation of the buttons they can you know change which buttons are there
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.160]   but there's always going to be the same row of buttons across the middle in the
[01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:38.360]   same basically out that's what you can kind of get some muscle memory going
[01:07:38.360 --> 01:07:40.720]   and uh... so that you can create a nap that is
[01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:44.320]   distracting out this but a lot of kind of fear this week about people joking
[01:07:44.320 --> 01:07:45.720]   about people creating
[01:07:45.720 --> 01:07:48.560]   video games you know what running for the on your dashboards that kind of thing
[01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:50.000]   but that's that simply not possible
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:53.280]   well also avoids the toxic health stew as microsoft call it
[01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:55.800]   or was apple i can't recall that
[01:07:55.800 --> 01:07:59.160]   uh... andrew cutting him writing in ours technica says it's not just auto
[01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:01.280]   and right where and t_v_
[01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:02.880]   will not be skinnable
[01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:07.840]   they will always be the same version out updates will come from google directly
[01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:11.040]   uh... and he says he talked with a google engineering director david birk
[01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:14.200]   said all the new and read initiatives and ask the key note will have user
[01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:15.160]   interfaces
[01:08:15.160 --> 01:08:18.320]   an underlying software controlled by google
[01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:22.680]   and that's the deal you make if you're l_g_ or moto or samsung
[01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:26.560]   i think that's good on the one hand because uh... you do avoid fragmentation
[01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:28.080]   you do know what you've got
[01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:32.360]   certainly an auto application that's very important but even for the watches
[01:08:32.360 --> 01:08:35.120]   uh... you use one you'll know how to use the other
[01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:37.040]   this is what microsoft did with
[01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:39.100]   windows phone
[01:08:39.100 --> 01:08:43.680]   but on the other hand it does kind of limit the innovation in the ecosystem
[01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:47.320]   right and manufacturers can still create custom apps of course they can still
[01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:50.880]   do deploy custom content so for example could write an app that only works in
[01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:52.280]   four cars through it
[01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:55.720]   android auto samsung can write apps that will only run and Samsung watches if they
[01:08:55.720 --> 01:08:56.640]   want to
[01:08:56.640 --> 01:08:59.880]   that sort of thing is fine but it comes to the the core aspect of the operating
[01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:01.160]   system itself
[01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:04.360]   that's locked out and i think just about any android family say that's for the
[01:09:04.360 --> 01:09:07.320]   best and of course when it comes to watch it there's so many more opportunities
[01:09:07.320 --> 01:09:08.960]   to personalize the devices
[01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:12.360]   much more so than phones now which all kind of more or less of shaded error
[01:09:12.360 --> 01:09:15.360]   morphed into the same sort of device is really difficult to tell phones apart
[01:09:15.360 --> 01:09:16.120]   these days
[01:09:16.120 --> 01:09:19.200]   but watches is a lot more room for differentiation especially when we look
[01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:21.280]   at the motor 360 which is around
[01:09:21.280 --> 01:09:23.480]   versus the two which are not around of course
[01:09:23.480 --> 01:09:26.480]   uh... that's that's another opportunity for manufacturers to differentiate
[01:09:26.480 --> 01:09:29.600]   themselves but even with the round interface the cards are going to be the
[01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:32.640]   same cards you just the corners will be out of
[01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:34.440]   that's interesting
[01:09:34.440 --> 01:09:37.840]   i uh... immediately i wasn't a google i also didn't get a free one but i did
[01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:38.800]   order
[01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:43.320]   i decided to get the same son because it's samsung phones only
[01:09:43.320 --> 01:09:46.080]   uh... i believe so yeah i think that's it
[01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:49.560]   yeah but l_g_ is cross-platform work with any uh...
[01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:53.120]   for three any jolly beener later for three or later maybe
[01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:54.120]   uh...
[01:09:54.120 --> 01:09:57.040]   so that's good that means to work with my phone and they even have a
[01:09:57.040 --> 01:09:59.400]   even go to a website in your phone
[01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:00.920]   uh... and check
[01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:04.720]   compatibility and i'll tell you if it's compatible
[01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:09.160]   uh... okay so look we've all seen every one of these stupid devices from the
[01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:11.800]   job on the nikey that
[01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:14.160]   uh... to the pebble
[01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:17.720]   i've had the gear one the gear to
[01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:21.240]   all of them have kind of left something to be desired
[01:10:21.240 --> 01:10:25.080]   is it your experience says this is your own as one to
[01:10:25.080 --> 01:10:30.480]   uh... on this panel that this is any better than those
[01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:33.320]   uh... it's it's very different
[01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:35.520]   that knows ultimately it's it's
[01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:37.800]   doing a different sort of thing right now she's really focused on
[01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:41.960]   notifications i think this is closer to google class then not to
[01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:44.720]   most of this what was that we've seen so far because really it's focused on
[01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:47.760]   notifications first and foremost and there's not really a lot else that you
[01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:48.760]   can do with it
[01:10:48.760 --> 01:10:51.560]   you can do a parameter on here you can get your heart rate
[01:10:51.560 --> 01:10:54.080]   which is no better than on any of the other gear devices which is the same
[01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:55.240]   not very good
[01:10:55.240 --> 01:10:58.480]   uh... but the really is a lot else that you can do right now uh... you know
[01:10:58.480 --> 01:11:02.680]   there's a lot of it right you if if you get it if you get a text message you
[01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:03.720]   can respond
[01:11:03.720 --> 01:11:05.360]   as a microphone
[01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:08.280]   can right you can do that if you want to i haven't really met anybody who
[01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:11.800]   wants to be talking to watch it so i'm not sure that the value of that to
[01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:15.720]   do to a lot of people look pretty dark but hey yeah i used to that but you can
[01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:18.320]   i mean it is nice to be able to say you know
[01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:20.960]   give me directions to whatever to your watch and have a pop up on your phone
[01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:22.040]   that's kind of nice
[01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:25.600]   uh... and i was also for example you know the contextual stuff is very good so
[01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:29.160]   i was flying back from san francisco here to albany uh... on on for thursday
[01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:29.920]   night
[01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:33.160]   and the watch not only gave me the weather in san francisco where i was but it
[01:11:33.160 --> 01:11:34.880]   gave me the weather here albany
[01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:37.760]   rose headed to and it gave me the weather in detroit where i was connecting
[01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:40.120]   which i thought was an interesting thing knows your itinerary
[01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:43.960]   that's right it and do all that it pops up uh... to show you your uh... your
[01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:48.280]   qr code for your check-in or does it doesn't do that yet no uh... at least
[01:11:48.280 --> 01:11:51.560]   not for delta so i do think that'll be coming in your future and i can't wait
[01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:56.160]   to confuse the security check point people with that i think i might watch
[01:11:56.160 --> 01:11:57.320]   exactly they already
[01:11:57.320 --> 01:12:00.240]   reason deep side when you come up with your phone
[01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:02.280]   yeah i don't believe
[01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:05.120]   now that i think that'll be here probably in the future and there'll be a lot more
[01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:08.880]   apps coming to them and there's there's obviously space for loading apps to
[01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:12.520]   your phone uh... in the app that that you run on your on your smartphone
[01:12:12.520 --> 01:12:15.440]   uh... so i think that that will be coming in the near future but right now it's
[01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:17.880]   it's very much the same sort of interface you see the glass you get
[01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:19.160]   public notification
[01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:22.880]   well now really is what it looks like is it this is it is it all the same
[01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:24.680]   stuff is now or
[01:12:24.680 --> 01:12:27.840]   uh... as far as i know yes all the same cars you see now in fact if you bring up
[01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:30.760]   now you'll see pretty much the same list of stuff it's just
[01:12:30.760 --> 01:12:33.520]   on your wrist of course and it's it's a little more dynamic of course because
[01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:36.880]   you get those notifications in real time you kind of feel more and kind of look
[01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:40.200]   at them as they pop up i like that notification so it's telling me right
[01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:43.480]   now my phone that i have six minutes to go home if i wanted to go home because
[01:12:43.480 --> 01:12:45.920]   it knows where i will go after this show
[01:12:45.920 --> 01:12:49.960]   it shows me birthdays of people who i follow on google plus it shows me the
[01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:52.720]   giant score because i know that i care about that
[01:12:52.720 --> 01:12:55.680]   the t_v_ show that i watch it shows his on the night
[01:12:55.680 --> 01:12:57.360]   shows me my stocks
[01:12:57.360 --> 01:13:01.280]   and articles uh... that i've searched for in the past i guess and the local
[01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:02.120]   weather
[01:13:02.120 --> 01:13:04.880]   and you know what it's doing the same thing you just described as tell me the
[01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:08.080]   weather in petaluma and in Maui
[01:13:08.080 --> 01:13:10.640]   because it knows that the notification that
[01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:14.640]   uh... denny's house is tweeted about me so that is not what you want to
[01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:18.560]   you get pretty much any notification that shows up on your uh... on your
[01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:21.520]   phone will show up here too so developers don't need to do anything
[01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:26.880]   extra to integrate here so i use any due for uh... for tasking love any of those
[01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:27.920]   pop up
[01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:29.440]   was pop up too
[01:13:29.440 --> 01:13:32.160]   uh... now presumably any do can then extend their app and provide more
[01:13:32.160 --> 01:13:35.040]   functionality to the watch which i'm looking forward to them doing uh... but
[01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:36.880]   for now those notifications will come right up
[01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:41.280]   i'm excited i want one didn't did that only is this a look like this
[01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:44.480]   have you i know you've used all those other things
[01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:48.160]   a little bit i get tired of them pretty fast and i was a statistic that came
[01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:51.920]   out recently that said that i think it's like forty five percent of wearables
[01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:53.920]   are ditched within six weeks
[01:13:53.920 --> 01:13:58.320]   um... hundred percent a mile and then you're like
[01:13:58.320 --> 01:14:01.440]   thousands of these things not completely bought into the
[01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:04.880]   like radiation on your body type stuff so
[01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:08.080]   um i just don't think we know enough about that kind of thing so i i like to
[01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:11.920]   play with it a little bit but um also i just don't think they're cute
[01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:16.880]   and i like watches for fashion my phone does all of that stuff
[01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:22.000]   so i just don't think that there's a market for a living watch free for a
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:26.000]   long time now you and everybody else we all uh... watch as we're super
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:29.680]   seated by our smartphones and it is so much trouble to get the smartphone
[01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:31.880]   out of your pocket
[01:14:31.880 --> 01:14:34.080]   it's a first world problem
[01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:37.440]   it's a really a solution to a first world problem for sure and i do think
[01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:41.280]   that we'll see new new applications and new new reasons to wear these things
[01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:44.080]   beyond just notifications but yeah right now it's very much i can't be bothered
[01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:46.560]   to reach in my pocket or i can't be bothered to dig into the bottom of my
[01:14:46.560 --> 01:14:49.760]   purse to pull my phone out uh... and that's obviously not oh you have that
[01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:53.680]   purse problem too yeah i do it's a large person so much stuff in there
[01:14:53.680 --> 01:14:58.720]   i can never find anything since boho is back in the bag
[01:14:58.720 --> 01:15:01.840]   how about you Denise would you buy one
[01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:05.920]   um i i don't think so i'm kind of like staying on the sidelines for the
[01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:11.680]   the various watch functionality things to to see what happens with them and
[01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:14.960]   how useful people feel that they are
[01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:19.120]   um you know i'm good with my phone and uh
[01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:24.240]   already feel you know silly enough talking into that
[01:15:24.240 --> 01:15:29.600]   right now that i necessarily need to talk to my watch although um i i think
[01:15:29.600 --> 01:15:33.920]   that we do need a world where the watch and the car and the phone and
[01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:36.880]   everything's integrated and whatever technology people
[01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:43.360]   like to interact with um works in a unified way and works well
[01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:46.960]   uh so you know i can i kind of see what
[01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:53.280]   google is doing um exerting a little bit more control over the android ecosystem
[01:15:53.280 --> 01:15:56.480]   here uh the thing i just notified Tim about is our
[01:15:56.480 --> 01:16:02.800]   same tweeter that let us know about the um uh what are those things called
[01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:08.080]   don't okay yeah okay so i'm gee rajib again uh
[01:16:08.080 --> 01:16:14.640]   sends us uh the developers file for the google cardboard and um
[01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:18.320]   the schematics and everything's google published it yeah google's put all this
[01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:22.080]   out and it's a cool site if you if you you uh scroll your mouse around it'll
[01:16:22.080 --> 01:16:26.240]   actually show you the whole thing and this by the way i think the dodo case
[01:16:26.240 --> 01:16:31.360]   guys just took it exactly from there right um these are like those
[01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:35.840]   kids that we do with my kids up on the home depot on the weekends
[01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:39.600]   i think that yes like a bird house i did that with my kid yeah
[01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:44.480]   yeah yeah there's no hammering involved here you do need a neo-dymium ring
[01:16:44.480 --> 01:16:49.600]   magnet and a ceramic disc magnet and apparently uh
[01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:55.360]   45 millimeter focal lengths uh glenses which are hard to get but uh so i think
[01:16:55.360 --> 01:16:57.920]   i think that the dodo case will save you some time
[01:16:57.920 --> 01:17:01.200]   they also give you developer documentation so and this is exciting you can
[01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:04.960]   write your own apps from your stuff should be a lot of good stuff yeah
[01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:09.920]   and i think that these wearable so is is really that the technology is there
[01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:14.240]   what what we really are waiting for is is for them to become fashionable
[01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:17.520]   because a watch and glasses these are accessories that
[01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:22.320]   you know the technology companies are are going so crazy to try and make them
[01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:25.920]   better and better they're already okay what we really need is for these to
[01:17:25.920 --> 01:17:29.520]   become desirable in terms of fashion and maybe that's why we say so many
[01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:32.960]   executives from the fashion world now coming over to technology and that's
[01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:35.920]   been an aim for many many years now there's been
[01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:39.520]   techno hp has been working with Vera Wang for you know
[01:17:39.520 --> 01:17:43.520]   we've seen these partnerships but it's not there yet i don't want a Wi-Fi
[01:17:43.520 --> 01:17:47.520]   dress but i really i've been on the market for it i do
[01:17:47.520 --> 01:17:52.320]   want a Wi-Fi dress how about a Wi-Fi moo moo for your trip
[01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:56.240]   tomorrow moo moo with what can i can uh is it uh is it
[01:17:56.240 --> 01:18:00.320]   is it go with me like the Wi-Fi follows me around in the dress
[01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:03.920]   i want that i think that's yes your your dress is a Wi-Fi we know you can
[01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:07.280]   order pizza because they demoed that on the stage with the android
[01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:10.320]   is is everybody just waiting i know what's going on here
[01:18:10.320 --> 01:18:13.520]   perfectly well you're just waiting to see what apples gonna do
[01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:19.200]   i i think that's part of that is is true yeah i i want it to be better looking
[01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:22.080]   i i think i think you're gonna get the burberry i want
[01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:26.000]   i want to read up yeah i i don't need to be better looking
[01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:30.640]   actually i need i need the stuff to work well i want my car and my i really
[01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:35.440]   want this whole you know universe that we're just on the verge of of when
[01:18:35.440 --> 01:18:39.200]   the car works the way you want it to the you can know whether your lights are
[01:18:39.200 --> 01:18:42.480]   burned out and what your thermostats doing and all that stuff
[01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:46.640]   uh it just sees easy and seamlessly and i don't think we're quite there yet
[01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:50.720]   yeah it's just the other day i had one of those little lights in my dashboard
[01:18:50.720 --> 01:18:54.000]   and i'm slipping through the stupid book and i'm like why is the technology that
[01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:57.600]   i have to figure out this light means come on it's just
[01:18:57.600 --> 01:19:00.960]   yeah your fault your watch could tell you that
[01:19:00.960 --> 01:19:05.840]   i see you right away yeah yeah and so there are some things that they talked
[01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:08.560]   about as well when it comes to android on for example if you have
[01:19:08.560 --> 01:19:12.000]   navigation open on your phone and you're directing somewhere and you plug your
[01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.880]   phone into your car the car will basically pick up navigation right in your
[01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:17.760]   dashboard and take off where you're left off effectively
[01:19:17.760 --> 01:19:20.640]   but if you're not navigating and just plug your phone in it won't
[01:19:20.640 --> 01:19:24.160]   start navigating it anywhere or it won't even take over the display of your car
[01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:26.800]   for example so there's some contextual stuff coming in there which i think
[01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:29.840]   is interesting and of course with with nest kind of getting in the game
[01:19:29.840 --> 01:19:32.560]   i think we'll definitely see some some good stuff when it comes to smart home
[01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:36.080]   integration as well so i think there's a lot more contextual stuff that's going
[01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:39.200]   to be coming in the future but right now the design is do leave a bit to be
[01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:42.640]   designed these watches are all very big i do think they don't look
[01:19:42.640 --> 01:19:45.680]   well they don't look great on women's wrists and smaller wrists they look
[01:19:45.680 --> 01:19:49.360]   pretty clunky my wife is very eager to get a device like this but whenever i
[01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:52.240]   have one she tries it on and it just looks kind of ridiculous on her
[01:19:52.240 --> 01:19:55.280]   unfortunately so she's she's still waiting for the arm
[01:19:55.280 --> 01:20:01.280]   oh the thing for a while was women in masculine watches that was in style
[01:20:01.280 --> 01:20:04.960]   yeah so we're shoulder pads too bad they missed it if we've moved on
[01:20:04.960 --> 01:20:07.520]   thank god
[01:20:07.520 --> 01:20:12.080]   well let's talk about auto because it looks like what google is doing is very
[01:20:12.080 --> 01:20:17.360]   similar to what apple's doing with their uh what do they call it
[01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:22.240]   car play car car play that they're casting it into the car so
[01:20:22.240 --> 01:20:26.560]   what since you're the car editor over there it's you know feel me in them what
[01:20:26.560 --> 01:20:30.480]   what does the car have to do i out he just announced for instance the 2015
[01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:36.480]   models will support uh android auto right and this is another bit of uh
[01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:39.200]   fear uncertainty that has been thrown on this week is that your car will
[01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:41.920]   probably support both of these standards there's a lot of people saying that you
[01:20:41.920 --> 01:20:44.400]   might have to buy one car or another based on what phone you have but it
[01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:47.120]   that would be very likely that that manufacturers will support both because
[01:20:47.120 --> 01:20:50.400]   ultimately from a car manufacturer standpoint they're very very similar
[01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:54.080]   all they need to do is basically run a very simple software stack in their
[01:20:54.080 --> 01:20:58.400]   cars and then provide a USB input and the means for video stream to come from
[01:20:58.400 --> 01:21:00.720]   your phone to your dashboard and that's pretty much all that they need to
[01:21:00.720 --> 01:21:03.040]   provide plus a couple buttons and some other stuff
[01:21:03.040 --> 01:21:06.480]   so car play works basically the same as android auto it's the same basically
[01:21:06.480 --> 01:21:08.880]   exactly the same thing so that what the phone is doing is effectively
[01:21:08.880 --> 01:21:12.400]   rendering an external display and then that that content is showing up on your
[01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:16.000]   dashboard and then voice commands and and touch screen
[01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:20.400]   or or physical buttons about stuff get then push back into your phone and that
[01:21:20.400 --> 01:21:23.680]   controls the apps so it's very much the same between the two the big
[01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:27.760]   difference between car play and android auto is that developers can get in
[01:21:27.760 --> 01:21:31.840]   the game when it comes to android auto they cannot do that when it comes to
[01:21:31.840 --> 01:21:34.880]   car play apple is basically locking things down and saying only our
[01:21:34.880 --> 01:21:39.280]   approved developers can write apps for car play at least for now android
[01:21:39.280 --> 01:21:42.800]   and google are giving developers the permission and the means to write apps
[01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:46.640]   but in a very limited way right now only media apps and messaging apps are
[01:21:46.640 --> 01:21:49.680]   allowed and again as i said before they had to fit into the standard templates
[01:21:49.680 --> 01:21:53.840]   that google has defined and those templates are approved based on
[01:21:53.840 --> 01:21:57.280]   global standards for distracted driving and that sort of thing so for example
[01:21:57.280 --> 01:22:01.040]   no single interaction with the app will take more than two seconds
[01:22:01.040 --> 01:22:04.000]   uh... those are things that are globally accepted and those are things that are
[01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:07.360]   are now approved and included within uh... the the
[01:22:07.360 --> 01:22:10.080]   international standard now there's another standard called mirror link which does
[01:22:10.080 --> 01:22:12.800]   the same sort of thing you plug in your android phone it connects and takes
[01:22:12.800 --> 01:22:14.400]   over the dash for the car
[01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:17.200]   that allows developers to do anything that they want to they can write any
[01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:18.560]   apps that they want to
[01:22:18.560 --> 01:22:21.840]   but those apps need to be certified to run in the dashboard so that's even more
[01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:24.720]   open than google but what what google didn't want to do is force developers
[01:22:24.720 --> 01:22:27.760]   to learn all these standards when it comes to button size and contrast and
[01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:29.760]   allowable fonts and things like that
[01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:33.520]   is a giant stack of of certifications that you can read if you really want to
[01:22:33.520 --> 01:22:36.240]   google said we're gonna you know kind of get rid of all that stuff and just
[01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:38.320]   basically create a template that's allowable
[01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:41.120]   and i said to fit within that
[01:22:41.120 --> 01:22:44.400]   you could it seems like a lot of interaction with the scream uh...
[01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:48.240]   that it does that it kind of fosters distracted driving i presume that they're
[01:22:48.240 --> 01:22:50.240]   going to be very careful about that
[01:22:50.240 --> 01:22:54.560]   yeah but they're absolutely i mean gm and outy and all the other 40 members
[01:22:54.560 --> 01:22:58.400]   had a very big part in saying what exactly these apps can look like and so
[01:22:58.400 --> 01:23:01.040]   these apps are all basically going through the same sort of standardized
[01:23:01.040 --> 01:23:05.360]   testing that any of the the head units for a general motor's car for example
[01:23:05.360 --> 01:23:08.400]   would go through they have to abide by the same rules and regulations as those
[01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:11.360]   things so while of course the demonstrations that we've all been
[01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:13.920]   getting this week you know it shows a lot of people staring at these screens
[01:23:13.920 --> 01:23:16.480]   hitting buttons and things like that scares me with it
[01:23:16.480 --> 01:23:19.840]   but anything can be done by voice they can all be done by streamable controls as
[01:23:19.840 --> 01:23:21.520]   well car supports it
[01:23:21.520 --> 01:23:24.960]   uh... and will never be more than i think about ten buttons on screen at one time
[01:23:24.960 --> 01:23:27.600]   they're all fairly large and they're all in the same place so you can get
[01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:31.040]   muscle memory going to will the google voice capability the same as it is on
[01:23:31.040 --> 01:23:33.200]   a phone in the words can i send a text and
[01:23:33.200 --> 01:23:37.680]   tweet and i you can reply to text i don't know if you can create a new text
[01:23:37.680 --> 01:23:41.040]   though that i'm not sure about so it may not be the same capability
[01:23:41.040 --> 01:23:44.480]   right but you can do searches for concept of right
[01:23:44.480 --> 01:23:47.600]   maybe you describe this but um what about when you don't have a good
[01:23:47.600 --> 01:23:50.720]   connection when you're driving out in the stick oh you're screwed
[01:23:50.720 --> 01:23:54.000]   you're gonna get lost you're gonna end up yeah you're dead because of the
[01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:57.280]   technology for a gps is much different you can actually
[01:23:57.280 --> 01:24:00.080]   get mapping when you don't have reception but that's not the case with
[01:24:00.080 --> 01:24:02.800]   these mobile devices it's a completely different
[01:24:02.800 --> 01:24:05.920]   mapping technology it would be just like google navigation now
[01:24:05.920 --> 01:24:08.720]   where you if you have connection when you start and you lose connection along
[01:24:08.720 --> 01:24:11.600]   the way that's fine because it'll cash that the path that you're going along
[01:24:11.600 --> 01:24:15.040]   or if you downloaded that map to your phone locally what you can do now
[01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:18.080]   uh you can then navigate within uh the other thing that the system can do
[01:24:18.080 --> 01:24:21.440]   because it talks to your car it can actually pull gps data from the car
[01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:24.800]   you can pull spadometer data and wheel position data from the car too so
[01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:27.440]   you know if you're walking through the city or if you go through a tunnel with
[01:24:27.440 --> 01:24:30.320]   your phone it gets really confused because the the gps
[01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:33.440]   sensors and phones are pretty weak compared to a car but if the car
[01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:36.080]   loses signal the car can still get a pretty good idea of where it is based
[01:24:36.080 --> 01:24:39.520]   on where it knew where it was before and based on how fast and what direction
[01:24:39.520 --> 01:24:41.840]   it's traveling so even if you're driving through a tunnel
[01:24:41.840 --> 01:24:45.040]   you'll still get better navigation through your car with your phone than if
[01:24:45.040 --> 01:24:49.040]   you just had your phone out i like that can i ask you a question do you think
[01:24:49.040 --> 01:24:52.080]   that car companies are going to embrace this because
[01:24:52.080 --> 01:24:56.320]   technology companies can do it better or do you think they'll get defensive
[01:24:56.320 --> 01:25:00.160]   because they have their own sorts of things they've been developing
[01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:02.800]   and they're going to embrace it very reluctantly but they don't really have
[01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:05.200]   much of a choice at this point they've been trying to develop their own
[01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:08.240]   systems that would be better for years now and ultimately they've failed and
[01:25:08.240 --> 01:25:11.680]   in fact i've been interested to watch all the poaching from
[01:25:11.680 --> 01:25:14.240]   these consumer tech companies that the auto manufacturers have been making
[01:25:14.240 --> 01:25:17.600]   hiring a lot of mobile developers to to help build their software and to improve
[01:25:17.600 --> 01:25:20.960]   their software but the you know when you're talking about software that goes
[01:25:20.960 --> 01:25:24.640]   into a car the the integration cycle and those things is at least three years
[01:25:24.640 --> 01:25:27.760]   more like five years most of the time and so even if they they're doing
[01:25:27.760 --> 01:25:31.200]   cutting-edge stuff it's three years away from showing up and that's that's a
[01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:33.040]   problem there there are solutions to that but the best
[01:25:33.040 --> 01:25:36.480]   solution is simply take that stuff out of the car put it in the phone
[01:25:36.480 --> 01:25:38.640]   and then you'll get a much better experience because that can be updated
[01:25:38.640 --> 01:25:41.840]   more easily so the manufacturers know that that's what people want many
[01:25:41.840 --> 01:25:44.560]   factories don't really want to hand that control over they want to control the
[01:25:44.560 --> 01:25:47.520]   dashboard as much as they want to control the shape of the steering wheel and
[01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:50.080]   the shape of the headlines and everything else but this is something that people
[01:25:50.080 --> 01:25:53.440]   are really going to demand in the next probably 24 months from now this is
[01:25:53.440 --> 01:25:56.160]   the sort of thing that people are going to expect from their cars
[01:25:56.160 --> 01:25:58.720]   so gm and forward and everybody else are going to reluctantly have to support
[01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:00.800]   it they have to be very careful they don't want
[01:26:00.800 --> 01:26:04.480]   legislatures they don't want congress to start
[01:26:04.480 --> 01:26:08.720]   passing laws about this stuff though because uh of distracted driving they've
[01:26:08.720 --> 01:26:12.080]   got to be really really cautious yeah that's the other thing too
[01:26:12.080 --> 01:26:15.040]   I spoke with many factors about that too and they are definitely afraid of that
[01:26:15.040 --> 01:26:18.000]   because they feel that that will stifle innovation I think that that definitely
[01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:21.040]   would yeah so I think that they are taking the right steps
[01:26:21.040 --> 01:26:24.640]   especially apple with carplay and google now with android auto they're being
[01:26:24.640 --> 01:26:27.120]   very careful about making sure that these interfaces pass all the
[01:26:27.120 --> 01:26:30.160]   regulations that are out there and well defined now and those right now are
[01:26:30.160 --> 01:26:33.600]   industry defined regulations but they are very comprehensive so I hope that we
[01:26:33.600 --> 01:26:36.720]   don't see any more legislation coming because that would definitely throw a
[01:26:36.720 --> 01:26:40.960]   big old wrench in the works so michael klein you stop watching
[01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:45.200]   twit as you're driving up here on your how did you get your pioneer to do
[01:26:45.200 --> 01:26:52.880]   that did you hack it no sort of sort of yeah he's busted except he
[01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:55.440]   tweeted it
[01:26:55.440 --> 01:27:00.880]   i don't know the twitter is like that was uh taking the back seat it was from the
[01:27:00.880 --> 01:27:05.840]   back seat that's right he wasn't driving someone's twitter feed very
[01:27:05.840 --> 01:27:10.000]   very good very good very good um google announced a lot of other stuff this
[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:13.200]   was a two and a half hour keynote that seemed like it would just never end
[01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:17.200]   there's uh the next generation of android and red elle with a beautiful design I
[01:27:17.200 --> 01:27:23.360]   thought beautiful design uh changes uh looking forward to that um android tv
[01:27:23.360 --> 01:27:27.920]   which is their third attempt um actually fourth if you include the
[01:27:27.920 --> 01:27:32.720]   ill-fated queue to get t get android in the living room
[01:27:32.720 --> 01:27:36.800]   um i though thought there were a couple of things that they showed that maybe
[01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:40.480]   they didn't fully explain how they worked and i thought could be very interesting
[01:27:40.480 --> 01:27:43.760]   one was the idea that you could use forget android tv
[01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:47.200]   you could use your chromecast to do a lot of the things that you would do with
[01:27:47.200 --> 01:27:51.920]   an android tv including cast applications play games
[01:27:51.920 --> 01:27:55.600]   it's unclear how they're going to do this when they're going to do this
[01:27:55.600 --> 01:27:59.440]   but uh this is pretty neat you can replicate your display or you will be
[01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:02.160]   able to replicate your display to the chromecast and that's functionality that
[01:28:02.160 --> 01:28:05.200]   i was going to shock that they didn't include in the first place right
[01:28:05.200 --> 01:28:08.400]   they are bringing that now i don't know if it'll be across every wi-fi chipset
[01:28:08.400 --> 01:28:11.280]   and every device that's out there but that'll definitely make chromecast a
[01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:14.080]   lot more usable i think for a lot of people also you'll be able to cast to
[01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:18.640]   uh somebody's chromecast without joining their wi-fi network and we've now
[01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:24.880]   learned that that's using uh uh inaudible tones to authenticate with the chromecast
[01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:28.080]   coming from your phone the chromecast is listening apparently
[01:28:28.080 --> 01:28:32.160]   that's really cool it's getting that sync up with the wi-fi network it's always
[01:28:32.160 --> 01:28:35.360]   a pain yeah so now you can just sit on the curb
[01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:38.800]   and and change somebody's channel
[01:28:38.800 --> 01:28:42.640]   um i thought that was really neat apparently google acquired the
[01:28:42.640 --> 01:28:47.360]   company that does this uh audio authentication
[01:28:47.360 --> 01:28:51.280]   um last year and this is uh this is the technology they're using although they
[01:28:51.280 --> 01:28:55.520]   didn't mention that at all in the keynote these ultrasonic chromecast but i feel
[01:28:55.520 --> 01:29:00.240]   like it's such a geek tool you know is are any real people using chromecast?
[01:29:00.240 --> 01:29:03.440]   it's a good question it seems so easy you just put it in the hcm i port you use
[01:29:03.440 --> 01:29:06.400]   your phone to set it up then you use your phone to find
[01:29:06.400 --> 01:29:10.320]   content and you cast it to your chromecast which then receives it and puts it on
[01:29:10.320 --> 01:29:15.520]   your screen what could be easier right it's only 35
[01:29:15.520 --> 01:29:20.560]   dollars yeah no they're i the normal people i know can't even figure out how
[01:29:20.560 --> 01:29:22.240]   to turn the tv on so this is not
[01:29:23.200 --> 01:29:29.680]   because let's wear the hcm i ports yeah what is an hcm i port right i think it's
[01:29:29.680 --> 01:29:34.480]   hdml yeah that thing that does the internet the
[01:29:34.480 --> 01:29:40.320]   html i got it on my tv now it's amazing they also showed and i thought this
[01:29:40.320 --> 01:29:43.520]   could be huge again they just did a little
[01:29:43.520 --> 01:29:47.760]   quickie the ability to run some android apps on your chromebook
[01:29:47.760 --> 01:29:52.400]   they showed evernote flip board um and i'm not sure they didn't really say how
[01:29:52.400 --> 01:29:57.040]   this works but it strikes me if you can do if you can run android apps
[01:29:57.040 --> 01:30:02.720]   on your chromebook they've added this kind of same app capability to
[01:30:02.720 --> 01:30:06.560]   google chrome the browser on windows and mac there's just a short amount of time
[01:30:06.560 --> 01:30:09.360]   before you can run android apps on your windows machine and your mac machine as
[01:30:09.360 --> 01:30:13.520]   well and this is really what the keynote was about
[01:30:13.520 --> 01:30:21.280]   android everywhere good strategy for google yeah obvious strategy yeah maybe
[01:30:21.280 --> 01:30:26.880]   i mean they had chrome OS 2 but android seems to be the killer um especially
[01:30:26.880 --> 01:30:29.440]   as they're trying to build dependence on things like android home and android
[01:30:29.440 --> 01:30:33.040]   notifications you know you want that data to be everywhere that you are
[01:30:33.040 --> 01:30:36.080]   and so for them to be able to extend android apps across all these platforms
[01:30:36.080 --> 01:30:38.640]   meaning you get more dependent on those android apps
[01:30:38.640 --> 01:30:41.760]   and as your accessibility and visibility into that data gets
[01:30:41.760 --> 01:30:45.200]   gets broader and easier to access and that means that that you have more
[01:30:45.200 --> 01:30:48.160]   opportunities to use that data and you become ultimately more tethered to
[01:30:48.160 --> 01:30:51.600]   their to their ecosystem absolutely what they want absolutely yeah i think it's
[01:30:51.600 --> 01:30:54.080]   absolutely great i think it's good for the users too i mean that that simple
[01:30:54.080 --> 01:30:57.360]   example of getting weather in detroit on my fly back was was ultimately a useful
[01:30:57.360 --> 01:31:00.160]   thing not that i couldn't have gotten that in some other way but to have it
[01:31:00.160 --> 01:31:03.200]   right there on my wrist was pretty nice i think that's the kind of thing that we
[01:31:03.200 --> 01:31:06.880]   can just expect to see in the coming coming years
[01:31:06.880 --> 01:31:10.960]   ben tompson uh who's been on twitter for and uh really think the world of he
[01:31:10.960 --> 01:31:15.360]   writes a blog called stratecory and a newsletter pointed out there is a
[01:31:15.360 --> 01:31:19.440]   difference between android on the phones
[01:31:19.440 --> 01:31:23.600]   and android on other things like your wrist
[01:31:23.600 --> 01:31:28.080]   mainly that phones are a must-have uh the primary difference in a watch and
[01:31:28.080 --> 01:31:31.600]   your phone is you buy the former the watch by choice
[01:31:31.600 --> 01:31:36.400]   and the latter by necessity um and i think that's a very good point that
[01:31:36.400 --> 01:31:40.160]   these other devices are more of a luxury item there you can expect them to
[01:31:40.160 --> 01:31:44.320]   dominate in the same way android has dominated the phone market
[01:31:44.320 --> 01:31:48.240]   and you can't even use your android wear watch without an android smartphone or
[01:31:48.240 --> 01:31:52.240]   android device uh so and i should clarify what was said before the
[01:31:52.240 --> 01:31:56.240]   samson android wear watch will work with any android 4.3 or above phone
[01:31:56.240 --> 01:32:00.320]   oh not just you know what let me check because when i thought when i went to
[01:32:00.320 --> 01:32:05.120]   the the play store it said that it was samson phones only so i must have
[01:32:05.120 --> 01:32:10.000]   misunderstood that but let me check android wear here let's just click this
[01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:13.600]   and look at the samson gear live that's the watch
[01:32:13.600 --> 01:32:17.520]   um and where did i see
[01:32:17.520 --> 01:32:24.640]   maybe you're right maybe you're right i thought i saw
[01:32:24.640 --> 01:32:29.440]   text that says with any samson phone but i guess that's not the case so
[01:32:29.440 --> 01:32:34.080]   good that's good news i ordered the other one but of course throughout this whole
[01:32:34.080 --> 01:32:37.760]   discussion i've been wondering about how the supreme court would think about
[01:32:37.760 --> 01:32:41.600]   your watch yeah can they search your watch without a warrant
[01:32:41.600 --> 01:32:44.320]   yeah it seems like these devices mostly push you
[01:32:44.320 --> 01:32:48.560]   information rather than you having some stored on there
[01:32:48.560 --> 01:32:51.840]   right well let's say you're getting pulled over by an officer in your hand
[01:32:51.840 --> 01:32:55.200]   is on the steering wheel and as the officer is talking to you you get a
[01:32:55.200 --> 01:32:58.400]   notification on your wristwatch that says something that incriminates you and
[01:32:58.400 --> 01:33:03.600]   the officer sees that is that probable cause in that case to search your phone
[01:33:03.600 --> 01:33:07.920]   well if they if it's in plain sight they don't need a warrant you know if you're
[01:33:07.920 --> 01:33:10.960]   watches their broadcasting here's the picture of you with the car
[01:33:10.960 --> 01:33:14.080]   ah exactly so turn off your smartwatch you get
[01:33:14.080 --> 01:33:17.360]   through everybody but do they need a warrant to swipe or can they do they
[01:33:17.360 --> 01:33:23.120]   are they're right i think they should have to have a warrant to swipe
[01:33:23.120 --> 01:33:29.040]   yeah if it if it if it involves deeper access i would think that it would
[01:33:29.040 --> 01:33:33.520]   you know again this decision that just came out deals with phones but
[01:33:33.520 --> 01:33:36.480]   there was a lot of good language and they're indicating that you know we have a
[01:33:36.480 --> 01:33:39.440]   lot of devices in our lives that have
[01:33:39.440 --> 01:33:43.200]   deep information about us far deeper than anything that we could keep in our
[01:33:43.200 --> 01:33:47.360]   pockets and uh a watch may fall into that category
[01:33:47.360 --> 01:33:50.800]   one thing google really has to worry falling in you can hide it a lot easier
[01:33:50.800 --> 01:33:53.120]   and there are a lot of cavities in your body to put in
[01:33:53.120 --> 01:33:58.720]   a sheet pocket and you know you can get creative if you're really that nefarious
[01:33:58.720 --> 01:34:02.400]   i'm just saying next time you see Becky Worley she has a story about that you
[01:34:02.400 --> 01:34:05.040]   should ask just next time you see Becky Worley just say
[01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:10.160]   where's the strangest place you ever saw somebody hide a watch and just let it
[01:34:10.160 --> 01:34:15.280]   let her talk it's you won't believe it
[01:34:15.280 --> 01:34:17.920]   okay then
[01:34:17.920 --> 01:34:22.320]   you got to think like a criminal if you're gonna think like a criminal be ahead in
[01:34:22.320 --> 01:34:25.760]   this world right yep not that you actually exercise these things but
[01:34:25.760 --> 01:34:29.120]   you're always one step ahead plan ahead avoid circumcision that's all i'm
[01:34:29.120 --> 01:34:36.000]   saying our uh our um yeah okay okay you know what i'm
[01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.240]   saying here it's time to come out of that rattle
[01:34:38.240 --> 01:34:41.680]   yeah time to time to move on i think we've covered uh
[01:34:41.680 --> 01:34:45.600]   anyway the only thing i wanted to ask is if the creepy factor where are we on
[01:34:45.600 --> 01:34:48.960]   the creepy factor with google is this because really this is moving google
[01:34:48.960 --> 01:34:53.680]   more towards a world where instead of you searching it pushes to you the
[01:34:53.680 --> 01:34:56.160]   information it thinks you want on your wrist and your
[01:34:56.160 --> 01:35:03.040]   glasses uh in your car uh in your tv set um have we raised the creepy factor or
[01:35:03.040 --> 01:35:05.920]   not but what google user is going to be like oh
[01:35:05.920 --> 01:35:10.080]   oh my gosh they they know who's emailing me and who's calling me and text it like
[01:35:10.080 --> 01:35:14.880]   what we expect this of google i don't think any of this was like whoa that's
[01:35:14.880 --> 01:35:18.160]   above and beyond i think was there any one thing there
[01:35:18.160 --> 01:35:23.120]   no fitness stuff this is so much more innocuous than google help with
[01:35:23.120 --> 01:35:26.960]   which everyone was pissed off about like i think they've dialed it by the way
[01:35:26.960 --> 01:35:29.520]   they're bringing that back but you're right it's not they're not going to
[01:35:29.520 --> 01:35:33.200]   violate any fda rules or need even fda permission for this
[01:35:33.200 --> 01:35:38.400]   new stuff i i um far out of mind you talk to larry page and send our patchy
[01:35:38.400 --> 01:35:42.960]   after the keynote and there's a really good bits blog post on this and one of
[01:35:42.960 --> 01:35:47.280]   the things he did ask about uh was creepiness
[01:35:47.280 --> 01:35:51.680]   um and he says do you worry the more devices we have that are connected to
[01:35:51.680 --> 01:35:54.960]   google there's not just a privacy question but also something like creepiness
[01:35:54.960 --> 01:36:03.520]   page i think had the right answer he says um as long as we make these things
[01:36:03.520 --> 01:36:07.840]   useful it people will accept them he says the
[01:36:07.840 --> 01:36:12.800]   problem is when we talk about things before people see them
[01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:15.840]   there's a much more negative reaction it's really important for people to be
[01:36:15.840 --> 01:36:19.440]   able to experience products otherwise you fear the worst without seeing
[01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:25.120]   the benefits that seems sensible to me if you can see google now and the value
[01:36:25.120 --> 01:36:29.520]   of google now and use it it won't bug you as much
[01:36:29.520 --> 01:36:33.600]   as if you just hear about this idea that google will tell you oh hey there's a
[01:36:33.600 --> 01:36:36.880]   great deer on pizza down the street and i know you like pepperoni so
[01:36:36.880 --> 01:36:41.920]   let's go right is that do you think that he's fear on that
[01:36:41.920 --> 01:36:45.760]   i think so and i think that's part of what makes that facebook uh research
[01:36:45.760 --> 01:36:49.280]   study seems partly bad because there ultimately was no
[01:36:49.280 --> 01:36:52.800]   there's no net benefit for facebook users coming out of that study
[01:36:52.800 --> 01:36:55.440]   and that's why i think there was so much such a negative reaction from that
[01:36:55.440 --> 01:36:58.400]   whereas with all the predictive predictive search things we're
[01:36:58.400 --> 01:37:01.200]   getting out of google those are helpful things and so therefore we're getting
[01:37:01.200 --> 01:37:03.280]   the service from he's saying the right words he says i'm not
[01:37:03.280 --> 01:37:07.040]   this layer page again i'm not trying to minimize the issues for me i'm so
[01:37:07.040 --> 01:37:10.560]   excited about the possibilities to improve things for people my worry
[01:37:10.560 --> 01:37:13.200]   actually would be the opposite we get so worried about these things we don't
[01:37:13.200 --> 01:37:16.800]   get the benefits i think that's what's happened in health care
[01:37:16.800 --> 01:37:20.400]   we decided largely through regulation that data is so locked up
[01:37:20.400 --> 01:37:23.600]   that it can't be used to benefit people well we don't
[01:37:23.600 --> 01:37:27.120]   mine data mine health care data if we did though we could save a hundred
[01:37:27.120 --> 01:37:33.440]   thousand lives next year i believe that that's interesting
[01:37:33.440 --> 01:37:36.880]   yeah and i think the other piece of this is is the
[01:37:36.880 --> 01:37:40.720]   other shoe to drop from the riley decision there's a lot of speculation
[01:37:40.720 --> 01:37:44.880]   about well you know if the court is recognizing that
[01:37:44.880 --> 01:37:49.200]   uh... we have this strong privacy information on our phones and the
[01:37:49.200 --> 01:37:52.800]   information that can be accessed from our phones
[01:37:52.800 --> 01:37:57.520]   you know how much protection does the cloud have and is the nsa
[01:37:57.520 --> 01:38:01.840]   surveillance constitutional and i think that's that's a strong piece of how
[01:38:01.840 --> 01:38:05.440]   much people are going to trust cloud services you know if you're putting
[01:38:05.440 --> 01:38:08.720]   all your information there who gets to see it who gets to use it page says
[01:38:08.720 --> 01:38:13.360]   he's worried that the media and governments are stoking people's fears
[01:38:13.360 --> 01:38:15.840]   and that will end up in a state where we could benefit a lot of people but
[01:38:15.840 --> 01:38:18.480]   we're not able to do that now that's a little self-serving this is larry
[01:38:18.480 --> 01:38:22.720]   page from last year we said i wish there were an island we could go to
[01:38:22.720 --> 01:38:27.280]   and then maybe mauley yeah i'll meet you there larry
[01:38:27.280 --> 01:38:30.480]   uh... street view it street view it
[01:38:30.480 --> 01:38:33.600]   um no no mention of google plus no mention of google glass no mention of
[01:38:33.600 --> 01:38:37.680]   google home or any any home initiatives doesn't mean they're not doing it
[01:38:37.680 --> 01:38:40.800]   in fact page in this article says no we're all in on google plus we're very
[01:38:40.800 --> 01:38:42.080]   happy with it
[01:38:42.080 --> 01:38:45.200]   um i think that this was a long enough keynote there
[01:38:45.200 --> 01:38:48.160]   it's been a long enough segment we're going to talk about the facebook case
[01:38:48.160 --> 01:38:51.920]   i uh i think there's a few more things to talk about before we wrap things up
[01:38:51.920 --> 01:38:55.280]   you know before we go to the ad though
[01:38:55.280 --> 01:38:58.400]   and by the way i i really want to thank you anthony for filling in for Chad
[01:38:58.400 --> 01:39:01.280]   johnson chat is on vacation he's he went to Birmingham for a
[01:39:01.280 --> 01:39:03.920]   i think a minecraft minecraft convention
[01:39:03.920 --> 01:39:08.320]   so uh got anthony muleson filling in but before we go to the ad Anthony let's
[01:39:08.320 --> 01:39:11.040]   see what we uh let's see what you missed if you missed anything on
[01:39:11.040 --> 01:39:14.320]   twitter this week was a good week previously on twitter
[01:39:14.320 --> 01:39:16.000]   you unbelievable
[01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:22.160]   ten years tonight google i/o developer conference of course and here is the
[01:39:22.160 --> 01:39:26.240]   one and only at jeff Jarvis the phrase that really resonated with me today
[01:39:26.240 --> 01:39:31.920]   was talking about the wearables now you can wear a computer on your body
[01:39:31.920 --> 01:39:35.520]   all day this week in law area pretty much is done
[01:39:35.520 --> 01:39:39.360]   i think what you see here is some issues about the court trying to deal with this
[01:39:39.360 --> 01:39:42.800]   new technology through this method of analogy i really don't think we should
[01:39:42.800 --> 01:39:46.240]   be all that surprise if we can take is a given that the court wanted to
[01:39:46.240 --> 01:39:50.000]   see this as a cable company from the beginning this week in google for years
[01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:53.040]   android did feel so little ill design a little clunky
[01:39:53.040 --> 01:39:56.320]   these new tools are obviously designed to address that i think that the
[01:39:56.320 --> 01:39:59.840]   complaint that android is just not as pretty not as aesthetically
[01:39:59.840 --> 01:40:02.320]   pleasing i think that that's that's a done beyond
[01:40:02.320 --> 01:40:05.840]   matt break weekly i'm really starting to believe that there's going to be a
[01:40:05.840 --> 01:40:09.040]   normal sized phone that's large that an iPhone and also one that's kind of like
[01:40:09.040 --> 01:40:11.680]   a pop target
[01:40:11.680 --> 01:40:16.000]   it's free when you watch from work
[01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:26.480]   no one makes tech fun like chad and leo on twight dot to me
[01:40:29.360 --> 01:40:35.680]   oh my goodness uh hey did uh i don't know if mike did he he did not okay so
[01:40:35.680 --> 01:40:39.120]   uh normally we'd say here's what's coming in the week ahead we're so exhausted
[01:40:39.120 --> 01:40:42.400]   from the week gone by that we just gonna forget it i don't know if there's
[01:40:42.400 --> 01:40:46.000]   anything coming up i'm not even gonna be here in the morning it is the fourth
[01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:49.200]   of july let's just relax set off fireworks explode things if you're not in the
[01:40:49.200 --> 01:40:51.920]   united states you could explode things anyway because it's the fourth of july
[01:40:51.920 --> 01:40:55.840]   year and all all bets are off our show today brought to you by personal
[01:40:55.840 --> 01:41:00.400]   capital uh really a clever idea i talked to its founder bill harris on
[01:41:00.400 --> 01:41:04.800]   triangulation a couple of years ago and he was looking for a way to help
[01:41:04.800 --> 01:41:08.160]   people make better sense of their financial life so they could make better
[01:41:08.160 --> 01:41:11.920]   decisions for their future and he's come up with this great free
[01:41:11.920 --> 01:41:16.400]   secure tool that is so cool it's personal capital and it helps you
[01:41:16.400 --> 01:41:18.800]   in a couple of ways first of all of course it's hard to keep track of all
[01:41:18.800 --> 01:41:22.000]   your all your finances your stocks your investments
[01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:26.400]   your charge card your bank accounts your your your property all the things
[01:41:26.400 --> 01:41:29.440]   that you've got they're all on different websites with different logins
[01:41:29.440 --> 01:41:32.640]   personal capital collates it all in a single page
[01:41:32.640 --> 01:41:36.800]   with easy to use easy to understand graphs and information
[01:41:36.800 --> 01:41:40.080]   and then of course it helps you analyze what you're doing are you paying too
[01:41:40.080 --> 01:41:44.080]   much for financial advice have you allocated your assets properly
[01:41:44.080 --> 01:41:46.960]   are you invested properly so that you can retire
[01:41:46.960 --> 01:41:50.800]   when that time comes some of some of you are young enough that you're probably
[01:41:50.800 --> 01:41:53.440]   not thinking about that now is the time
[01:41:53.440 --> 01:41:56.320]   like i told chad that and chad's been using i think he's been using personal
[01:41:56.320 --> 01:41:58.880]   capital now is the time to start thinking about
[01:41:58.880 --> 01:42:02.080]   retirement because if you start putting stuff aside now and you do it right
[01:42:02.080 --> 01:42:06.720]   you won't have to worry um i love personal capital signing up
[01:42:06.720 --> 01:42:09.920]   it just takes a minute it'll pay big dividends
[01:42:09.920 --> 01:42:15.200]   right away total clarity transparency make better investment decisions
[01:42:15.200 --> 01:42:19.360]   and by the way if you do use their financial advisors they are not
[01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:22.160]   on commission they're all certified financial planners
[01:42:22.160 --> 01:42:26.080]   they're fee-based but you don't have to use them it's absolutely free personal
[01:42:26.080 --> 01:42:30.000]   capital dot com slash twit it's a smart way to grow your money
[01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:33.600]   and i strongly suggest you sign up and try it today i've been using it for two
[01:42:33.600 --> 01:42:37.280]   years ever since i talked to bill and i'm thrilled with it it's just really
[01:42:37.280 --> 01:42:41.440]   really great do you know how your 401's case doing this year
[01:42:41.440 --> 01:42:44.800]   do you know maybe not maybe you should
[01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:50.000]   personal capital dot com slash twit
[01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:54.240]   uh okay the crumbs i don't know if i even want to mention this story about
[01:42:54.240 --> 01:42:57.440]   tim coat i'm not i'm a cano i'm gonna take the high ground
[01:42:57.440 --> 01:43:00.480]   who the hell cares hell yeah hell yeah i don't know
[01:43:00.480 --> 01:43:05.440]   you it's stupid and i don't even know why it's a story
[01:43:05.440 --> 01:43:08.960]   of course now i've everybody going what what did they say i don't know
[01:43:08.960 --> 01:43:13.360]   i don't know google it's none of our business none of our freaking business
[01:43:13.360 --> 01:43:17.520]   that's right um let's talk about the facebook thing
[01:43:17.520 --> 01:43:22.720]   because i think maybe i am upset for no good reason it turns out
[01:43:22.720 --> 01:43:27.440]   facebook participated in a study an interesting study
[01:43:27.440 --> 01:43:32.960]   uh about how what you see on social media affects
[01:43:32.960 --> 01:43:39.360]   your feelings and it turns out that uh in i think it was
[01:43:39.360 --> 01:43:43.680]   january 2011 for one week facebook intentionally
[01:43:43.680 --> 01:43:49.840]   manipulated the news feeds for 700 000 users
[01:43:49.840 --> 01:43:56.640]   they gave half of them uh happy stories half of them sad stories
[01:43:56.640 --> 01:44:00.800]   and then a week later monitored their posts to see if they were happier or
[01:44:00.800 --> 01:44:04.880]   sadder and surprise surprise people who saw depressing sad stories were more
[01:44:04.880 --> 01:44:07.840]   depressed and people who saw happy go lucky stories were
[01:44:07.840 --> 01:44:11.680]   happier first of all what a waste of time
[01:44:11.680 --> 01:44:17.040]   that's obvious but okay this was by the way cornell was involved in this
[01:44:17.040 --> 01:44:22.000]   uh i think uh california university involved in this study
[01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:26.160]   um experimental evidence of massive scale emotional contagion
[01:44:26.160 --> 01:44:30.160]   through social networks published in the proceedings of the national academy of
[01:44:30.160 --> 01:44:32.720]   the sciences of the usa
[01:44:34.400 --> 01:44:40.400]   but princeton university was uh woman who edited from princeton even said
[01:44:40.400 --> 01:44:43.920]   the creepy factor was off the scale here
[01:44:43.920 --> 01:44:47.200]   is it in normally in research when you do this kind of research you get the
[01:44:47.200 --> 01:44:50.080]   consent of the subject you may not say what you're going to do
[01:44:50.080 --> 01:44:53.040]   but you say we're going to do a research study uh just want to make sure it's
[01:44:53.040 --> 01:44:56.720]   okay with you and when you don't you have to get consent from a
[01:44:56.720 --> 01:45:01.440]   review board that and this study did which yeah but you know what the review
[01:45:01.440 --> 01:45:05.040]   board was it was facebook's own review board
[01:45:05.040 --> 01:45:07.920]   it was an it was a local institutional review
[01:45:07.920 --> 01:45:11.840]   oh so it wasn't facebook i don't think it was facebook
[01:45:11.840 --> 01:45:15.360]   i think they they went through the proper how does this happen
[01:45:15.360 --> 01:45:20.720]   science channels don't you have to don't you feel like this is incredibly
[01:45:20.720 --> 01:45:25.120]   invasive and yes and and messed up i want to use a
[01:45:25.120 --> 01:45:28.880]   stronger word but i'll use the messed word messed up
[01:45:28.880 --> 01:45:32.800]   yes because how much different is this than the stanley millgram experiment
[01:45:32.800 --> 01:45:36.400]   which that was messed up yeah that was the
[01:45:36.400 --> 01:45:40.560]   impetus of review boards that's why we have them is because
[01:45:40.560 --> 01:45:44.720]   when you manipulate someone's psyche to think the world is one way that it is
[01:45:44.720 --> 01:45:48.960]   not it has lasting effects on them even if it's something as stupid as your
[01:45:48.960 --> 01:45:53.600]   newsfeed this is as the researchers pointed out
[01:45:53.600 --> 01:45:57.120]   part of facebook's terms of service
[01:45:57.120 --> 01:46:00.960]   and that's what i was gonna say don't know anybody think that it's not illegal
[01:46:00.960 --> 01:46:03.120]   it's not illegal sure they covered themselves on that
[01:46:03.120 --> 01:46:07.120]   thread this is this is what facebook said and legality are two different
[01:46:07.120 --> 01:46:11.440]   things yes unethical maybe legal absolutely when users sign up for
[01:46:11.440 --> 01:46:14.640]   facebook they agree their information may be used for
[01:46:14.640 --> 01:46:19.360]   quote internal operations including i hope you read this carefully
[01:46:19.360 --> 01:46:23.680]   troubleshooting data analysis testing research research research research
[01:46:23.680 --> 01:46:28.480]   and service improvement uh now of course the other point to be made is that
[01:46:28.480 --> 01:46:32.880]   facebook is constantly manipulating the newsfeed in ways that we don't know
[01:46:32.880 --> 01:46:37.280]   who knows what the hell they're up to this makes me want to quit facebook
[01:46:37.280 --> 01:46:40.160]   so bad and it did this two years ago which is also
[01:46:40.160 --> 01:46:44.160]   disconcerting to me in there's a statement posted just about an hour ago from one
[01:46:44.160 --> 01:46:47.840]   the uh data engineers from facebook kind of explaining things a little bit
[01:46:47.840 --> 01:46:50.320]   better apologizing and saying that they wish that they had been a little bit
[01:46:50.320 --> 01:46:52.640]   more communicative and transparent for the reasoning
[01:46:52.640 --> 01:46:55.120]   but he said you know we've learned a lot and grown a lot in the past two years so
[01:46:55.120 --> 01:46:58.480]   we're better at this now but still there was been two years of this sort of
[01:46:58.480 --> 01:47:01.520]   activity and that's i'm wondering what other studies are still
[01:47:01.520 --> 01:47:05.440]   in the pipeline and haven't even been published yet but i do agree that i
[01:47:05.440 --> 01:47:08.080]   think that they were not acting ethically here but to play
[01:47:08.080 --> 01:47:11.280]   devil's advocate how is this different than a website using an a b test to
[01:47:11.280 --> 01:47:15.520]   decide which headline they should run for a given story
[01:47:15.520 --> 01:47:18.560]   i'll throw that out there well i can tell you one thing facebook got
[01:47:18.560 --> 01:47:23.840]   sued over beacon they're gonna get sued over this good i hope they do
[01:47:23.840 --> 01:47:28.640]   i think they will i mean professor james gremlin who is far more knowledgeable
[01:47:28.640 --> 01:47:33.680]   about this sort of thing uh then i would ever pretend to be uh has said
[01:47:33.680 --> 01:47:36.960]   you know if you're exposing people to something that causes changes in
[01:47:36.960 --> 01:47:40.720]   psychological status that's experimentation and requires informed
[01:47:40.720 --> 01:47:45.200]   consent uh should anyway so i mean he's just
[01:47:45.200 --> 01:47:49.760]   kind of spitballing as a law professor but if he's spitballing as a law professor
[01:47:49.760 --> 01:47:54.080]   there are plaintiffs lawyers out there who are putting it in pleadings and
[01:47:54.080 --> 01:47:59.120]   uh probably thinking about filing as a class i mean
[01:47:59.120 --> 01:48:03.600]   i did i mean the because you wouldn't know if you were uh part of the 700
[01:48:03.600 --> 01:48:09.280]   thousand right how would you know that right uh if you're not really sad
[01:48:09.280 --> 01:48:16.000]   january 2011 i was so sad for a week and all of my yeah i don't know you'd have
[01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:20.480]   to go through and say if assuming you'd even have a record of what was
[01:48:20.480 --> 01:48:24.240]   i just think this is on facebook then is the only takeaway on this is little
[01:48:24.240 --> 01:48:27.280]   peek under the curtain uh and how facebook runs its business
[01:48:27.280 --> 01:48:32.000]   how they are ethically how they feel about you as a facebook user
[01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:35.920]   and just you know understand we've learned something here
[01:48:35.920 --> 01:48:41.840]   uh just i don't know i always feel bad when i visit facebook i just feel
[01:48:41.840 --> 01:48:45.360]   crappy afterwards i feel like i should take a shower
[01:48:45.360 --> 01:48:48.240]   do people think that ab testing is a psychological experiment too because
[01:48:48.240 --> 01:48:51.520]   ultimately you're going to find someone's psyche to get them to click
[01:48:51.520 --> 01:48:54.960]   uh and you're using different headlines to to basically influence their decision
[01:48:54.960 --> 01:48:57.920]   no different than you go to a restaurant the chef says do you like this or this
[01:48:57.920 --> 01:49:02.240]   is where the uh the eye doctor says a or b it's just you given somebody a choice
[01:49:02.240 --> 01:49:06.240]   and the choice is an explicitly requested or explicitly
[01:49:06.240 --> 01:49:10.160]   given but you just see well to people like this side of that side that does not
[01:49:10.160 --> 01:49:14.000]   feel as manipulative as somebody modifying the newsfeed to try to make
[01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:17.680]   me happy or sad that seems right and these researchers had to go to
[01:49:17.680 --> 01:49:21.840]   facebook and say our hypothesis is that it will
[01:49:21.840 --> 01:49:26.320]   the emotional content of yours facebook feed will affect your emotional content
[01:49:26.320 --> 01:49:29.920]   your emotional response so we intend to manipulate this in
[01:49:29.920 --> 01:49:34.400]   order to elicit emotional responses from your participants
[01:49:34.400 --> 01:49:38.080]   and that is very different than just seeing what color looks based on your
[01:49:38.080 --> 01:49:40.000]   banner wouldn't you say i don't know i mean
[01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:43.360]   isn't that the same thing as an editor going to to another editor saying i
[01:49:43.360 --> 01:49:46.320]   believe that if we change the headline to be this structure that we'll get more
[01:49:46.320 --> 01:49:49.200]   people to click on it so therefore let's run both using
[01:49:49.200 --> 01:49:52.240]   some optimizing software they a b testing capabilities
[01:49:52.240 --> 01:49:54.960]   and we'll see which one is more effective and therefore they're going to learn
[01:49:54.960 --> 01:49:57.520]   which is more effective again i'm playing devil's advocate here but i
[01:49:57.520 --> 01:50:00.720]   am very effective is a different thing because this these authors have
[01:50:00.720 --> 01:50:04.720]   specified to facebook that we would like to emotionally manipulate your
[01:50:04.720 --> 01:50:09.280]   users and they said yes it's not a matter of which ones
[01:50:09.280 --> 01:50:12.960]   you know get the most clickbait which i agree does happen
[01:50:12.960 --> 01:50:15.600]   but when once facebook got this got this
[01:50:15.600 --> 01:50:19.360]   got this abstract then they should have said no
[01:50:19.360 --> 01:50:21.840]   well the good news is fewer than one tenth and one percent of the users
[01:50:21.840 --> 01:50:25.920]   committed suicide so it's okay i don't know but that's a legitimate question
[01:50:25.920 --> 01:50:29.440]   what if somebody got so depressed they they you know they harmed themselves
[01:50:29.440 --> 01:50:32.960]   because of this stupid study then what's the liability
[01:50:32.960 --> 01:50:35.520]   and there's one other thing out of this is that i'm not sure that they should
[01:50:35.520 --> 01:50:38.640]   prove anything because if you need your seeing sad news you might
[01:50:38.640 --> 01:50:41.520]   say oh i'm really sorry to hear about that and then ultimately you are
[01:50:41.520 --> 01:50:43.680]   contributing to their research but it doesn't necessarily mean that you're
[01:50:43.680 --> 01:50:47.680]   actually any saturday show yes dumb the whole thing is dumb
[01:50:47.680 --> 01:50:51.520]   and by the way you mentioned natalie i did quit facebook once i wish i weren't on
[01:50:51.520 --> 01:50:54.320]   facebook but i feel like i can i have to use it so i can report on
[01:50:54.320 --> 01:50:58.240]   stories like this yeah i need i need an experience that so i'm taking the
