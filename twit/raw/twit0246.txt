[00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.280]   It's time for Twit.
[00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.800]   This week in tech, the show that covers all the tech news
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.840]   and joining us some actual real life tech journalists.
[00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.360]   I'm merely appunded.
[00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.920]   But you can't say that about Mr. Dwight Silverman.
[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.120]   He is tech reporter for the Houston Chronicle,
[00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.000]   the venerable Houston Chronicle.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.080]   Blogs at blogs.cron.com/techblog.
[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.720]   Welcome, Dwight.
[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:50.240]   Thank you.
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.800]   It's good to be here.
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.400]   I don't get to be appundant.
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.400]   Oh.
[00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.360]   Can you be both?
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.840]   I think you can.
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.520]   I always have a piece of paper that says, actually,
[00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.400]   my journalism degree from the University of Houston
[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.520]   says, Bachelor of Journalism, which gives me a BJ.
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.400]   I've heard you, probably.
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.000]   Wait a minute.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.200]   I'm changing your lower third.
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.560]   Dwight Silverman, BJ.
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.360]   Very good.
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.920]   Congratulations.
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.440]   That's a promotion.
[00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.000]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.200]   They probably call it a JB.
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.120]   No, they do not.
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.360]   They call it a BJ.
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.200]   They do call it a BJ.
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.960]   That's what she said.
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.640]   All right, joining us also.
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:32.880]   He's in the dark, but not because he's
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.000]   at the Witness Protection Program,
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.120]   but merely because Veronica Belmont's in Japan,
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.760]   Mr. Ryan Block of Gadget, GDGT.com.
[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:39.640]   Hi, Ryan.
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.040]   Hey, thanks for having me.
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.960]   I want to lay claim to being the most backlit
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.240]   guest that you ever had.
[00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.760]   I swear to God, all we have to do
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.040]   is make your voice show block.
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.080]   Dersh, people would think we had Steve Jobs on or something.
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.400]   I don't know.
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.360]   Exactly.
[00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.480]   And do you have a bow cutter?
[00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:56.960]   I can make you sound funny.
[00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:57.680]   All right, let's do it.
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.560]   We could do that probably after the fact.
[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.760]   I don't know if I could do it.
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:01.240]   Oh, I don't know.
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.400]   I'll have to--
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.520]   this board does many things, most of which I don't understand.
[00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.280]   Also with us, Mr. Mark Millian of the Los Angeles Times.
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.480]   Hey, Mark.
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.120]   Hey, I am actually front lit in front of a bright, sunny window.
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.440]   You look fantastic, Mark.
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.600]   Why, thank you, Leo.
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:22.160]   Your beat is a new media/social media, kind of?
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.560]   Social media, general internet type stuff.
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.760]   But I do cover a little bit of Apple
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.960]   and helped out with the Pong HP thing last week.
[00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.160]   Well, that's the big story of the week, obviously.
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.400]   But you know, it's funny because if I'd had Ryan on,
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.200]   he probably would have known this last Sunday
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.880]   and I should have had you on.
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.120]   But we missed the big story of the week last to it
[00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.160]   because even though it happened Friday, a week ago,
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.120]   Friday, nobody knew about it until Monday.
[00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.120]   And that, of course, is the raid at Jason Chen's house.
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.720]   This would back to the lost iPhone
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.360]   and know we're not going to spend an hour talking
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.560]   about the lost iPhone on this.
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.480]   But I thought since we hadn't talked about it on Twitch
[00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.240]   because we didn't know about it and because we got such
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:06.680]   an august panel, I think it'd be good to talk about it today.
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.720]   First of all, Ryan, you found it in gadget.
[00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.080]   You're well aware of the gadget blog wars.
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.280]   What do you know about this?
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.480]   Do you think gadget was offered the phone
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.200]   and turned it down and Gizmodo took it?
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.440]   What is your take on this all?
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.720]   Well, you know, a gadget was offered the phone
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.120]   at the same time or right around when Gizmodo was offered it.
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.960]   They had a picture.
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.160]   And yeah, and that's how Engadget had the photos up first.
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.440]   The difference was Engadget passed on it.
[00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.840]   So they had these photos from the people shopping it around,
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.360]   but they didn't have the phone itself.
[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.000]   So, you know, Engadget didn't know whether or not it was real.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.640]   They suspected that it was, but it was hard to say
[00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:48.560]   because Gizmodo actually had the device by that point
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.840]   and gadget had photos.
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:51.840]   So it was a little bit different.
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.160]   But you know, Engadget, we sold it to AOL in 2005.
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.280]   AOL is obviously a very large publicly traded company.
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:04.000]   So from a legal standpoint, they're fairly cautious.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.640]   I think that from, and I don't even want to get
[00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.240]   into like the ethical moral discussion.
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.680]   I mean, I think that you probably have already
[00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.120]   hashed that out quite a bit.
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.960]   Yeah, I point people to Mac break weekly,
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.560]   this week in law, this week in Google,
[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.920]   all of the shows of the past week.
[00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:20.040]   We've probably done five hours on this subject.
[00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.080]   Yeah, I don't think we need to get into the moral
[00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.200]   or ethical aspects of that.
[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:28.200]   But you know, for whatever reason, they chose to pass on it
[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:33.440]   more than likely due to advice from legal counsel, AOL,
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:38.120]   legal, and you know, it tends to be very conservative
[00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.680]   in terms of liability.
[00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.440]   Since it's a very large company, they want to limit
[00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:44.120]   as much liability as they can.
[00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.280]   And Gizmodo did not pass on it.
[00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.480]   Were you offered the phone?
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:50.000]   No, I was not offered the phone.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.320]   Would you have bought it?
[00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.400]   If had you been offered the phone?
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:54.720]   You know, I wouldn't have bought it,
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:59.880]   but I probably would have tried like hell to figure out
[00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:05.040]   a way to do it in a way that was not illegal.
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:07.080]   'Cause you know, when you acquire the phone,
[00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:08.840]   that's when it becomes illegal.
[00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.120]   It's purchasing still on properties.
[00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:11.320]   And if that person's selling the phone,
[00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:12.320]   that is also legal.
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:13.320]   Right.
[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:14.600]   If you would have just said,
[00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.600]   hey, I'd love to come over to your house
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:19.160]   for a couple of days and maybe rent a room.
[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.920]   And if there should happen to be a phone on the table,
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:22.920]   then that would be great.
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:23.760]   (laughing)
[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:24.600]   No, I don't know.
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:25.440]   I mean, it's--
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:27.560]   I'll have to remember that next time.
[00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:31.600]   I would like to rent a room in your home for $5,000.
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:34.640]   And if there should happen to be a phone there,
[00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:35.480]   I wouldn't be.
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:36.680]   Right, exactly.
[00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:39.920]   I mean, it's easy to kind of say what you might have done
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:40.760]   or what you might not have done.
[00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:41.600]   I mean, it's hard.
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:42.440]   It's hard.
[00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:43.280]   You know, somebody asked me that.
[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:44.960]   If somebody had shown up at the door of the Twink Cottage
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.960]   saying, I think this is the next iPhone,
[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:47.840]   I would like you to have it.
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.000]   I wouldn't have paid $5,000,
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.320]   but only because I didn't have $5,000.
[00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:51.560]   If he'd say, would you give me five bucks,
[00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.520]   I would give him five bucks.
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:54.440]   It's just as illegal.
[00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:55.280]   Well, that would be illegal.
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:58.000]   Yeah, not a felony unless it's 900 plus, but--
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.920]   Yeah, it's interesting.
[00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:00.760]   You know.
[00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:02.240]   What do you think--
[00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:05.080]   Let me ask Dwight, because presumably,
[00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:07.760]   you work for a newspaper, this kind of thing comes up.
[00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:10.920]   The Houston Chronicle won't pay for a scoop like this, would it?
[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:13.040]   No, I don't think we would have paid for that.
[00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:15.600]   And particularly, you know, at the time
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:17.160]   that they were offered the phone,
[00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:19.880]   they didn't know that it wasn't a Chinese knockoff.
[00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:22.880]   It might not necessarily have been a real iPhone.
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:25.000]   Do you want to shell out that kind of money
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.840]   on the possibility that it's not real
[00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:30.920]   or that it was gotten illegally?
[00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:33.280]   And, you know, I would have turned it down flat,
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:37.200]   but like Ryan said, I would have been at my most persuasive,
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:38.960]   trying to at least get my hands on it.
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:39.800]   How about you, Mark?
[00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:42.400]   It's your kind of obligation as a journalist
[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.080]   to figure out, is this real?
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.520]   If it's real, how much can I learn about this
[00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:49.800]   without, you know, without myself breaking the law, right?
[00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:51.640]   So there's this dance that you have to play
[00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:53.360]   in these situations, which, you know,
[00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:54.920]   you want to do the right thing,
[00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:58.200]   but you also have an obligation to your audience
[00:07:58.200 --> 00:07:59.800]   to break the story.
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:01.920]   I mean, you're, you know, if you're not doing that,
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:03.120]   you're not doing your job.
[00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:05.200]   So you want to make sure that you can do your job,
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:06.400]   but also not be breaking the law.
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:08.200]   It's tricky. I understand that line
[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:09.840]   and you're walking that line.
[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:11.200]   That's why we do meta news here.
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:12.160]   I'm not walking that line.
[00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:13.000]   Yeah, me neither.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:13.840]   I do meta news.
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:16.320]   I, you know, I only cover what you covered.
[00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:17.840]   And then you take the fall,
[00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:21.200]   but I get to talk about the gizmodo story for weeks
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.440]   without any risk at all.
[00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:24.400]   Mark, what would the LA Times do?
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:26.920]   Did they give you any schooling?
[00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:29.000]   I mean, you came out of college to the Times.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.440]   Do they sit you down with a lawyer at some point
[00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:33.560]   and say, here's the rules.
[00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:35.720]   Yeah, you know, I talked to,
[00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:39.120]   to one of the editors at gizmodo right after it went down
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:41.960]   and he told me first, I believe,
[00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:46.040]   it was the first report that they had actually paid something
[00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:46.880]   for the phone.
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:49.840]   He confirmed that, yeah, we did pay for it,
[00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:52.000]   which was kind of obvious, but,
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.760]   so Wired was also offered the phone
[00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:58.120]   in addition to Engadget.
[00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:02.240]   But gizmodo ended up paying,
[00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:04.480]   Gawker ended up paying 5,000 for it.
[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:06.840]   And they didn't come to the LA Times.
[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:08.360]   Would the LA Times have paid for it?
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:10.960]   It's a little shady,
[00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:13.280]   but we have paid for things in the past.
[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:16.800]   I mean, even something as simple as,
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:18.160]   if we're reviewing the iPad,
[00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:22.880]   we're gonna buy an iPad and pay for that unit to review it.
[00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:24.400]   Well, that's what I do too, because I don't,
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:26.080]   mostly because I don't wanna owe Apple anything.
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:27.760]   I prefer to buy it, I can afford to buy it,
[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:29.520]   so maybe it's better to buy it.
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:32.880]   There was also a circumstance a few years ago
[00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:37.880]   of the LA Times paying for what appeared
[00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:42.600]   to be a stolen flash drive that was being sold
[00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:45.320]   on the black market in Afghanistan.
[00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:48.480]   That now, see, that's a good analogy of the US military.
[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:50.000]   So there's a perfect analogy.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.040]   There's a public's right to know
[00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:53.920]   the provenance of this thing is unknown,
[00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:55.500]   so you could be culpable,
[00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:59.480]   yet it's your job to expose this information.
[00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:00.480]   What did the Times do?
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:02.880]   - Well, there's still a bit of a difference
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:07.480]   between the US military and Apple's like shady trade secrets.
[00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:10.240]   - Yeah, which one would you prefer to cross?
[00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:13.680]   Steve Jobs or the Joint Chiefs of Staff?
[00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:15.680]   I prefer to cross the Joint Chiefs.
[00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:16.520]   - I'm afraid of that.
[00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:18.040]   (laughing)
[00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:21.480]   - They may have nukes, but Jobs got a bad temper.
[00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:25.560]   - Well, so with this memory card,
[00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:28.960]   it was this Afghani black market
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:33.360]   and it was actually US military secrets
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:35.680]   that were on this memory stick.
[00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:38.840]   So it's, the LA Times did end up paying for it.
[00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:39.680]   - Really?
[00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:41.000]   - It's kind of a good thing they did
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.720]   so that it didn't get in the hands of some terrorist
[00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:46.560]   or conversation or something.
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:47.520]   - That's why Gizmodo bought the phone.
[00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:49.280]   They didn't want to get in the hands of the terrorists.
[00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:51.640]   - They didn't want to see any of the terrorists.
[00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:54.360]   - I'm surprised actually that Nick Denton didn't use that
[00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:55.200]   excuse.
[00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:57.040]   I think he used every other excuse.
[00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:58.560]   If he'd only thought of that one.
[00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:00.960]   - I think we're doing a funny thing about this challenge.
[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:03.720]   - Journalism like roles and shield laws.
[00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:04.800]   - Right.
[00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:07.000]   - And I ended up digging up this quote,
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.400]   Denton talking to The Washington Post,
[00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:12.120]   I think it was a couple of years ago
[00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:15.440]   and saying that it's not the institutional intent
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:16.880]   to be journalists.
[00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:19.680]   We may commit journalism at times.
[00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:20.520]   - By accident.
[00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:23.320]   - Yeah, Denton's been pretty out
[00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:25.440]   about their intentions for a very long time.
[00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:30.160]   I mean, they've never viewed themselves as a gocker
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:33.200]   as an organization has never really viewed themselves
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:36.000]   as an above board kind of journalistic operation.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.640]   And there are people there who I think take their job seriously
[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:41.240]   and who do think of themselves as journalists.
[00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:44.480]   But Denton, I think that that is totally a sincere comment
[00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:45.320]   from him.
[00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:48.080]   I mean, it's not his intention to commit journalism
[00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:49.040]   on a daily basis.
[00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:50.520]   He's out for page views.
[00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:51.920]   He's out for money.
[00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:53.360]   And the funny thing is about the situation.
[00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:55.920]   I mean, it might have been largely avoided
[00:11:55.920 --> 00:12:00.920]   if he hadn't been so aggressive about tub thumping
[00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:05.160]   the fact that they paid money for this phone.
[00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.520]   I mean, if they'd never really talked about it,
[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:10.000]   there's a good chance as all just would have gone away.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.880]   They'd have made the story about the phone
[00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:15.000]   and not about how they got the phone.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.520]   - Well, that's where the stink is.
[00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:18.080]   The way that they outed this guy,
[00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:20.200]   the way that they published his picture,
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:22.760]   I mean, the whole thing, that kind of stinks.
[00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:24.320]   I was not pleased about that.
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:26.240]   - Well, Gogger, that's Nick Jett.
[00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:28.000]   - That's Nick. - He's 100% him.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   - Yeah.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.400]   - Gogger and Gizmodo wanna have it both ways.
[00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:35.440]   They want to be known as kind of an outlaw organization
[00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:36.840]   in terms of news.
[00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:40.160]   They don't necessarily want people to think of them
[00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:42.400]   as journalists, but then that's how else
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:45.320]   do you build your credibility?
[00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:49.800]   You have a reputation and you build that by reporting
[00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:52.680]   that's true and reporting that is believable
[00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:55.040]   and reporting to a certain extent that's fair.
[00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:57.360]   - But they got millions of page views.
[00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:59.800]   I mean, this was very valuable.
[00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:03.280]   - This is the dilemma of the web, I think.
[00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:07.000]   I think every news organization that has the ability
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.520]   to see how many people are looking at their news
[00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:12.080]   and what they're looking at,
[00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:15.200]   soon as you see what people are looking at,
[00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:17.320]   that changes what you write about.
[00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:20.040]   And I think that just because you can count something
[00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:21.880]   doesn't mean it's a good idea that you should.
[00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:25.000]   - Can you speak to the competition
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.240]   between Gizmodo and Gagit?
[00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:29.680]   It seems like it's worse than the journal in the times.
[00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:31.600]   It's worse than any competition,
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:33.560]   worse than the giants' dodgers.
[00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:38.560]   I mean, it seems like they would do anything to beat
[00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:41.360]   Gizmodo would do anything to beat Gagit to the punch.
[00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:42.800]   - I don't know if it's really about that anymore.
[00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:44.480]   I think actually the competition is larger
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:45.960]   kind of died down.
[00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:47.760]   - Yeah, there were a few, I mean, look,
[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:50.520]   they're both the two most prominent gadget technology
[00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:52.520]   publications in the business.
[00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:54.000]   So of course they're competing with each other
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.040]   on a day to day basis.
[00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:56.840]   - But they've kind of made it so they don't have to.
[00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:59.680]   - Yeah, that's exactly what it was.
[00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:02.880]   Back in the day when we first started in Gagit,
[00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:06.920]   it was our only job to catch up to Gizmodo.
[00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:08.280]   And we did that in about nine months,
[00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:10.240]   which we were all kind of shocked by.
[00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:13.160]   And then at that point, our job was to legitimize
[00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:15.360]   the publication because you got to remember
[00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:18.840]   back in 2009, I'm sorry, 2004, 2005,
[00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:23.440]   gadget blogs, it wasn't a thing.
[00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:25.760]   It wasn't the way that it is today.
[00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:28.680]   I mean, most publications gave preference
[00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:31.600]   to publications with, I'm sorry,
[00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:34.080]   most organizations gave preference to publications
[00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:38.320]   with some kind of print, a magazine or a newspaper.
[00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:39.680]   Now it's really shifted.
[00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:44.680]   Online is the focus in print and magazines and newspapers
[00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:47.920]   are increasingly less important.
[00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:49.000]   No offense mark.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.840]   - Whoa.
[00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:54.520]   - But at this point, at this point,
[00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:56.760]   kind of the fact is both publications
[00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:58.840]   have earned their place at the table.
[00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:01.480]   So to speak, they've earned their place in the pantheon.
[00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:05.480]   And so the competition is not as heated as it once was
[00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:08.640]   because at the time it was competing with each other
[00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:10.920]   and competing to prove that they could actually
[00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:13.400]   make legitimate publications.
[00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:14.960]   Now it's kind of been shown.
[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:16.360]   - Yeah, it really was.
[00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:18.360]   Nobody questions the fact that Engadget and Gizmo
[00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:20.480]   are legitimate publications now.
[00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:21.640]   - So what's the latest?
[00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:25.880]   The last I heard was that the San Mateo police
[00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:28.280]   decided to hold off on their investigation
[00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:29.960]   pending a ruling on the shield laws
[00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:32.440]   because there's some question whether their search warrant
[00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:36.080]   was legal given California and federal protection laws.
[00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:38.920]   And until they get a ruling for sure,
[00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:40.480]   they're not gonna look at Jason's stuff.
[00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:41.960]   Meanwhile, Jason doesn't have a computer,
[00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:43.280]   doesn't have an iPad.
[00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:47.080]   Doesn't have business cards because they took those two.
[00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:50.280]   And he's just kind of floating in space, poor guy.
[00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:53.560]   - Is there an update to Dwight on that story?
[00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:56.680]   I mean, we're just in hold right now.
[00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:59.960]   - Yes, the last I've seen is that they simply are sitting
[00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:00.800]   on it.
[00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:02.280]   I'm not sure who they're asking.
[00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:06.400]   I guess it would maybe be California Attorney General
[00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:08.080]   or maybe just the DA.
[00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:13.000]   But at this point, you know, the investigation is in limbo.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:17.240]   And I imagine that somebody at Gizmodo can loan Jason,
[00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:18.920]   maybe an old HV.
[00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:19.760]   - No problem.
[00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:21.240]   - You know, I find a sign.
[00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:22.200]   Something.
[00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:24.400]   Well, you know, this has made his career in some ways.
[00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:26.280]   If he doesn't go to jail, it's good.
[00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:27.560]   You know, this is a good thing.
[00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:29.560]   Because to jail, it's not so good.
[00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:30.720]   Do you think it's a jail?
[00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:32.560]   They're investigating?
[00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:34.160]   Who are they investigating?
[00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:37.000]   I think they're, I mean, he obviously is at the root
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.560]   'cause he's in the video holding the phone.
[00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:42.000]   You know, he's the guy going, this is the phone.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.240]   - Yeah. - That actually doesn't
[00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:44.840]   necessarily mean anything.
[00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:47.760]   - No, but I mean, in terms of the criminal prosecution,
[00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:49.880]   if they take this to court, they're not looking,
[00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:51.480]   they don't care who's showing phone.
[00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:53.080]   - They're trying to figure out who bought it.
[00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:54.800]   - No, but the reason they went to his house
[00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:56.520]   is either just saying, - It's just looking for evidence.
[00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:59.080]   - The chances are that most of the evidence that they need
[00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:01.640]   is the root of it is going to be at Jason's house.
[00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:02.480]   That's why they want to do that.
[00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:03.320]   - And that's what they said.
[00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:04.160]   They said, no, he's not a suspect.
[00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:05.920]   We're just investigating.
[00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:06.760]   - Right.
[00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:08.400]   - They're looking for evidence.
[00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:10.320]   - I'd hate to be that kind of suspect, Mark Millian.
[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:12.440]   - Oh, let's take all your crap.
[00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:13.600]   We're just investigating.
[00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:14.600]   (laughing)
[00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:16.120]   - Right.
[00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:19.240]   Well, at my publication, we get a little bit more protection.
[00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:21.960]   And I'm willing to bet we have a lot more lawyers.
[00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:23.040]   - Well, that's an interesting question.
[00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:26.520]   I mean, just because you're an actual newspaper,
[00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:27.360]   the kid is pretty--
[00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:29.720]   - We wouldn't let the police in the building.
[00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:32.280]   They wouldn't be able to break into our office
[00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:35.520]   and just lift my computer off of their desk and walk out.
[00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:38.240]   Jason was working out of his home.
[00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:39.240]   - Right.
[00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:41.000]   - It's interesting, 'cause the chief counsel,
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.320]   the COO at Gawker, had given him an email saying,
[00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:48.120]   "Show this to the cops when they come."
[00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:50.240]   That says, "California Shield laws prohibit you
[00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:52.360]   from searching this premise."
[00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:53.920]   And the cop said, "Oh, that's interesting.
[00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:54.760]   I'll keep that.
[00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:56.360]   We'll have that also as part of the evidence.
[00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:57.200]   Thank you.
[00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:58.040]   What else you got?"
[00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:00.240]   'Cause they'd been there for two hours when he came home.
[00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:04.280]   - Well, the question, the debate is,
[00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:07.600]   do California Shield laws shield journalists
[00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:09.920]   from situations where they may have committed a felony?
[00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:11.400]   And that's the question here.
[00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:16.120]   The investigation is not to find out
[00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:17.480]   who supplied them with the phone
[00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:18.520]   and who committed that act.
[00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:21.560]   The investigation is about the felony
[00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:26.560]   or supposed felony act of purchasing stolen merchandise.
[00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:28.560]   - So we're pointing out that this is like
[00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:31.240]   three years ago internet time and happened.
[00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:35.000]   We found that out on Monday and it does feel like old news.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:35.880]   So we're gonna wrap it up.
[00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:38.520]   But it's a fascinating story.
[00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:39.600]   We've talked to a number of lawyers.
[00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:41.320]   We had Denise Howell on Mac Break Weekly.
[00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:43.760]   We've, or was it, yeah, it was Mac Break Weekly.
[00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:46.600]   We've had, you know, the EFF has weighed in.
[00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:49.040]   The New York Times has talked to lawyers
[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:50.480]   and there he doesn't seem to be agreement
[00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:53.400]   about exactly what's going on
[00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:57.720]   or who exactly, you know, is protected by Shield rules.
[00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:59.160]   According to somebody in our chat room,
[00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:02.440]   I don't know, I'd like to find the source of this.
[00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:04.640]   The police think they found the culprit
[00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:05.920]   and he's regretful about it.
[00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:07.960]   The guy who actually stole the phone,
[00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:11.000]   this is a mashable story.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.760]   - His name has come out.
[00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:14.520]   The guy who's fired out at him.
[00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:16.360]   - I'm really surprised that it took this long.
[00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:18.800]   I mean, he shopped this to pretty much every technology
[00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:21.200]   publication out there in Gadgetkizmodo.
[00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:22.440]   Wired, CNET.
[00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:23.360]   - Can I say his name?
[00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:24.200]   I guess I can say his name.
[00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:27.480]   21 year old Brian Hogan of Redwood City
[00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:30.000]   wired, uncovered his identity after following a trail
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.840]   of clues on social media websites,
[00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:33.760]   some of which have now been taken down.
[00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:36.440]   He has an attorney, Jeffrey Bornstein,
[00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:37.840]   who provided a statement to Wired,
[00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:40.160]   stating quote, "Hogan regrets his mistake
[00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:43.000]   "in not doing more to return the phone."
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:48.040]   Apparently he had a friend try to contact AppleCare
[00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:49.920]   to return the phone.
[00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:51.240]   - Yeah, that's not the best way to say it.
[00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:52.080]   - Huh?
[00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:53.400]   - You know, of course we--
[00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:54.240]   - He don't tax it for him.
[00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:55.480]   What more could he do?
[00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:57.320]   - You guys missing a phone?
[00:19:57.320 --> 00:20:00.640]   - Anyway, he's got a lawyer
[00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:02.440]   and I think if I were him, I'd have a lawyer too.
[00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:04.240]   And if there is a criminal investigation,
[00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:05.520]   clearly it's gonna center around
[00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:08.440]   whoever they think got the phone originally.
[00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:10.320]   Interesting that the guy at Apple,
[00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:12.120]   as far as we know, still has not been fired,
[00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:14.160]   the original engineer, we won't say his name.
[00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:17.160]   I think he should be somewhat protected until he's,
[00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:18.240]   you know, there's some evidence that he's
[00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:19.600]   culpable of a crime.
[00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:20.760]   - You know, it doesn't matter that I think
[00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:21.600]   that's the announcement.
[00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:23.760]   - That guy, his iPhone, they ought to have him
[00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:27.160]   on the stage showing the new phone by iPhone.
[00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:29.520]   - And one more thing, Mr. Gray, there's a phone.
[00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:30.360]   (laughing)
[00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:31.200]   - Yeah, that's the first one.
[00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:33.640]   - You know, in that story, the Wired story,
[00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:37.080]   one of the funny things is towards the end of it,
[00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:40.520]   the attorney is trying to paint a picture of Hogan
[00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:42.760]   as a guy who's never been in trouble before
[00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:44.280]   and actually pulls out the line
[00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:46.840]   that he works with Chinese orphans.
[00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:49.840]   - Oh, that's nice.
[00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:50.680]   - Isn't that nice?
[00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:51.720]   - That's sweet.
[00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:57.280]   He obviously must have known what he saw there.
[00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:58.680]   - Sorry, it's a great story.
[00:20:58.680 --> 00:20:59.520]   I'm sure there'll be more,
[00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:01.200]   we will probably talk more about it.
[00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:03.480]   But as we hadn't covered it on Twit, there you go.
[00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:05.600]   There's the latest, it'd be easy to find out
[00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:06.520]   what's going on with that.
[00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:11.160]   And I did wanna ask these three esteemed panelists
[00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:12.400]   of what they thought about it.
[00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:14.080]   This has been a week for acquisitions,
[00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:17.200]   HP buys Palm, Apple buys Siri, there's more.
[00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:18.720]   We will talk about that in just a little bit,
[00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:19.880]   but we're gonna take a break right now.
[00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:21.760]   Dwight Silverman is with us from the Houston Chronicle,
[00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:23.000]   Mark Millian from the LA Times,
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.720]   and from GDGT.com, our good friend Ryan Block.
[00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:28.040]   This is a Twit.
[00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:29.800]   Before I go much further, I wanna tell you about
[00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:32.960]   something brand new from the folks at Citrix.
[00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:36.000]   It's called Go To Training.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.440]   Wow, this is a great idea.
[00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:39.920]   You know, they do that Go To My PC,
[00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:41.760]   the Remote Access Program, they do Go To Meeting,
[00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:42.720]   which is great for business.
[00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:44.560]   Go To Training takes that backbone,
[00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:47.160]   the great computer sharing backbone
[00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:50.440]   that Citrix is known for, Remote Access,
[00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:52.480]   and applies it to training.
[00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:54.200]   And I'll tell you this is something we've needed
[00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:55.120]   for a long time.
[00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:58.000]   If you've had to sit through a boring seminar at work,
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.720]   or you've tried some of the online training solutions,
[00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:02.360]   you're gonna love Go To Training.
[00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:03.200]   What an improvement.
[00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:04.120]   Go To Training.
[00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:06.960]   You can have up to 200 people in your training.
[00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:10.200]   You can have your presenters be anywhere in the world.
[00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:12.440]   200 live, but then you can record the training.
[00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:13.400]   So then this is beautiful,
[00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:15.520]   so that after the training's done,
[00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:18.360]   you've got an on-demand version of it.
[00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:19.760]   There's a training content library
[00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:21.960]   to which you can upload any document type,
[00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:23.240]   or link to any websites,
[00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:25.400]   so your trainees can review it before,
[00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:27.280]   during and after the training.
[00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:30.120]   Of course, completely customizable training tests,
[00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:32.320]   polls, integrated chat.
[00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:36.380]   It is just a fantastic platform.
[00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:38.920]   I want you to try it free for 30 days.
[00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:40.600]   If you're a trainer, this is something you need to know
[00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:43.160]   about GoToTraining.com, one month absolutely free.
[00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:44.080]   If you're not a trainer,
[00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:45.360]   but you had to put up with bad training,
[00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:46.440]   which I just had to do,
[00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:48.560]   I don't even gonna talk about it.
[00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:49.920]   That's why I'm a big fan of this.
[00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:52.320]   You really ought to tell your trainer
[00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:53.760]   about GoToTraining.com.
[00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:56.200]   30 days free from the folks at Citrix.
[00:22:57.040 --> 00:23:01.720]   GoToTraining.com.
[00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:05.880]   Please tell your IT department about this.
[00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:07.880]   You don't wanna have to suffer any longer,
[00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:09.400]   enough with the suffering.
[00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:11.040]   So I think this is a great story,
[00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:12.640]   and really deserved to be the lead story.
[00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:14.240]   I wanted to get the iPhone story out of the way,
[00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:19.240]   but really the big story today is HP buying Palm
[00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:22.480]   for $1.2 billion.
[00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:23.800]   Did any of you see that coming?
[00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:25.520]   Mark Millen, did you see that coming?
[00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:29.120]   I did not, but since it happens, it makes sense.
[00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:30.560]   Makes sense, it's like it's one of those,
[00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:31.840]   oh, I should have thought of that.
[00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:34.560]   How about you Ryan, did you think that was gonna happen?
[00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:37.120]   Not necessarily HP, but somebody was definitely,
[00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:39.760]   I mean they made it clear that they were gonna sell.
[00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:42.560]   We knew they were for sale, HTC Pass, Lenovo
[00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:45.600]   was kind of considered, but I don't think
[00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:46.480]   I would have thought of HP.
[00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:49.560]   Now HP, 1.2 billion is not a whole lot for HP.
[00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:53.200]   And boy, it puts them back in the game.
[00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:55.680]   Yeah, it does, and I think that the one thing Apple
[00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:57.840]   is kind of proven, especially if you look
[00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:00.400]   at their quarterly results over the last year,
[00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:03.000]   and how much of their revenue is now represented
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   by iPhones specifically, is that you need to have
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.400]   some skin in this game.
[00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:11.600]   Like you have to be in the mobile space now,
[00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:14.240]   because the opportunity is just so massive.
[00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:16.800]   And for HP people to be able to snap up
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:20.360]   kind of a premium smartphone company
[00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:21.880]   with its own operating system,
[00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:24.560]   with its own intellectual property,
[00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:27.040]   it's a pretty, pretty good move for them.
[00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:29.200]   The question is whether they're gonna screw it up.
[00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:30.040]   (laughs)
[00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:30.880]   As they've known to.
[00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:32.480]   Do you think it's for the iPhone,
[00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:35.720]   or do you think the HP Slate will run
[00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:37.920]   not Windows 7, but WebOS?
[00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:41.360]   Well, I think they said during the announcement
[00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:42.960]   in the conference call afterwards
[00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:46.280]   that they are looking at it for tablets.
[00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:49.040]   Ryan had mentioned in a tweet
[00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:51.400]   that the WebOS is an embedded OS
[00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:52.960]   and wouldn't necessarily work,
[00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:55.240]   and it's current form on the Slate.
[00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:58.400]   But the WebOS is built around Linux,
[00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:01.840]   and so it should be relatively easy to port it over
[00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:02.840]   if they haven't already.
[00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:05.640]   I'm sure somebody at Palm had been playing around
[00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:07.120]   with the idea of tablets.
[00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:11.440]   And I think primarily that's why HP bought it.
[00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:13.680]   Yeah, I think you need to be in the mobile market,
[00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:17.960]   but I don't necessarily know that mobile means smartphone.
[00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:22.520]   And HP in its acquisition of Compaq
[00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:25.240]   got a really nice notebook design group
[00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:27.000]   which is based here in Houston.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.080]   All of their HP notebooks are designed here,
[00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:33.000]   and I believe the Slate was designed here as well.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.840]   And so those guys are probably just drooling
[00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:37.800]   to get their hands on this thing and put it to work.
[00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:40.000]   Well, let's not forget that they're, believe it or not,
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:40.840]   I was shocked to learn this.
[00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:42.160]   HP does sell a smartphone.
[00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:44.960]   It's an IPAC, the brand it got from Compaq.
[00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:47.560]   Right, running in Windows Mobile.
[00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:49.600]   And what's interesting is it's a really,
[00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:53.920]   it's a very much a early 2000s design.
[00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:55.040]   Oh yeah, it's clunky as hell.
[00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:56.040]   It's very clunky.
[00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:57.720]   In fact, it looks like the old Palm.
[00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:00.080]   It looks like the old, you know,
[00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:02.600]   the big fat Palm smartphone.
[00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:06.120]   So, you know, they've said that they're gonna keep those
[00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:10.800]   around at least initially, but my suspicion is that
[00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:12.440]   they won't last much longer.
[00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:15.360]   Interestingly, also in that conference call,
[00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:17.880]   they made a lot of soothing sounds to Microsoft
[00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:20.880]   and continue to say, oh, Microsoft is a great partner.
[00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:24.160]   So, of course they're gonna smooth those feathers.
[00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:26.640]   Right, right, but I suspect at Microsoft,
[00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:28.120]   you don't particularly sense,
[00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:32.240]   since Steve Ballmer was on the stage at CES,
[00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:35.800]   showing off his Slate computer running Windows 7.
[00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:38.800]   And now with the rumor that the Slate computer
[00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:41.040]   running Windows 7 is dead,
[00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:43.520]   I imagine that Steve Ballmer is not happening.
[00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:45.920]   Whoopsies, yeah, this was a tech crunch rumor.
[00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:47.440]   I don't know whether to credit or not.
[00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:50.080]   Mike Arrington says the slate is dead.
[00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:52.040]   So, let's talk, actually Ryan, let me ask you,
[00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:56.180]   why do you say the WebOS wouldn't work on the Slate?
[00:26:56.180 --> 00:27:00.800]   Well, I mean, they could design a tablet to run WebOS.
[00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:01.640]   That's fine.
[00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:03.480]   It's just WebOS as an embedded operating system
[00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:07.200]   doesn't run on the kind of processors that the Slate has.
[00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:09.200]   It's for an arm processor.
[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:11.160]   Yeah, it's for an embedded processor.
[00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:15.120]   Yeah. It's like iPhone OS runs on the iPad
[00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:17.680]   and on the iPhone and on the iPod Touch.
[00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:18.880]   Those all run the same processors.
[00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:21.880]   You can't run desktop OS 10 on that.
[00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:22.720]   Right.
[00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:24.000]   It's just, you can't do it.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.240]   I mean, there are ports and you could try,
[00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:27.360]   but that's not really the point.
[00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:29.920]   The point is that these are very particular types
[00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:33.520]   of processors intended for low power consumption
[00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:35.480]   and high performance with very particular kinds
[00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:36.320]   of operations.
[00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:38.160]   So really it would be a straight but happy.
[00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:40.000]   I mean, we saw the Slate specs leaked out.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   It was an Adam processor.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.960]   Well, it couldn't be an Adam processor for WebOS.
[00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:46.240]   I mean, the problem with the Slate is we saw all the specs
[00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:49.480]   and I mean, they were really just going after the tablet PC,
[00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:51.080]   the Slate PC design.
[00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:51.920]   It was very generic.
[00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:53.000]   It's been around for many years.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.400]   I mean, it's not a new thing.
[00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:56.320]   You know, there've been NECs and Toshiba.
[00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:58.440]   There've been all kinds of Slate PCs been around
[00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:00.360]   for the last eight and nine years.
[00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:01.200]   They've been car-
[00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:01.800]   They've been frankly.
[00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:03.120]   Yeah, and they've been terrible.
[00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:03.960]   I mean, you look at this thing.
[00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:05.320]   It's got USB ports.
[00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:06.280]   It's got all these ports.
[00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:09.040]   I mean, it's a very small Slate style PC.
[00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:09.840]   That's not what you want.
[00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:12.160]   You don't really want, I mean, okay, maybe you do want that.
[00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:13.560]   It's not what I want.
[00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:15.080]   I want something that's a little bit more like the iPad
[00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:16.760]   where it's very optimized.
[00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:19.320]   You don't want a netbook without a keyboard.
[00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:20.200]   Hold on.
[00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:22.320]   But if I wanted that, I would just get a netbook.
[00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:23.160]   Yeah, right.
[00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:25.280]   If I wanted something along those lines, if I wanted a PC.
[00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:27.080]   Free keyboard with every slate.
[00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:28.040]   I would get it with the keyboard.
[00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:28.880]   Yeah.
[00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:30.040]   I don't know what they're offering.
[00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:32.800]   What they had on offer was a PC without a keyboard.
[00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:34.960]   So what they need to do is they really need to rethink
[00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:38.120]   the Slate and think about it in terms of,
[00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:40.280]   not in terms of the desktop OS metaphor,
[00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:42.320]   because that thing was going to run Windows 7.
[00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:42.840]   Right.
[00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:46.480]   They need to rethink it and think about how Web OS
[00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:51.880]   would be applied to a Slate style portable device.
[00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:53.160]   Mark Millian?
[00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:53.680]   I don't know.
[00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:54.440]   I don't know.
[00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:55.520]   Our ports so bad.
[00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:57.800]   I've heard from a lot of people whose biggest problem
[00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:01.760]   with the iPad is that they have to buy an external dongle
[00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:06.120]   to plug in a camera and a separate adapter, which
[00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:07.560]   doesn't yet exist, to print.
[00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:12.080]   And I mean, it could be the best of both worlds.
[00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:16.400]   I agree with Dwight that Palm OS is
[00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:19.440]   going to be absolutely huge for this device.
[00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:22.960]   They need to optimize something for the bigger tablet form
[00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:23.880]   factor.
[00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:29.080]   And it would be an absolutely great OS for a tablet.
[00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:33.000]   And the added benefit is being able to plug in your camera
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.880]   if you have it with you without remembering
[00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:40.480]   to bring an extra adapter in order to plug that in.
[00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:42.960]   I guess it really comes down to what you think the iPad--
[00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:44.280]   well, first of all, there's no question
[00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:45.280]   the iPad's successful.
[00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:47.640]   Friday, the 3G came out.
[00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:50.720]   It looks like, according to Chitika,
[00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:54.000]   which is a website that does some interesting IP address
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   monitoring of iPads, that a couple of 100,000 3Gs
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.520]   went out the door on Friday.
[00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:02.120]   So they're now up to 1.3 million, according to-- again,
[00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:02.840]   Apple's not saying.
[00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:06.200]   But according to Chitika, 1.3 million
[00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:08.240]   iPads sold in the first months.
[00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:08.800]   It's clearly a hit.
[00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:10.200]   There were lines for the 3G.
[00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:11.120]   I was surprised.
[00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:11.880]   It's clearly a hit.
[00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:13.360]   I'm excited to talk to the one with that.
[00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:14.640]   So is that--
[00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:18.480]   If HP sold 100,000 of their slate,
[00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:19.920]   I think they're very, very excited.
[00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:22.120]   More iPads were sold probably in the first weekend
[00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:24.560]   than tablet PCs were sold in the entire 10 years
[00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:27.480]   of tablet PC-dom.
[00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:28.800]   I mean, it's a category--
[00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:29.920]   I think that's an exaggeration.
[00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:31.880]   I think that's actually probably very accurate.
[00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:34.760]   However, I think it's very compelling to think of,
[00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:40.520]   not just iPads, but Android-based tablets or slates,
[00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:42.520]   and maybe web OS tablets or slates.
[00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:44.680]   And I think Google's going to do Android.
[00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:46.000]   Others are going to do Android.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.800]   I think HP is clearly thinking along the--
[00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:50.120]   I mean, isn't that what we're seeing?
[00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:52.760]   Isn't that why they bought web OS twice?
[00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:54.680]   I mean, isn't that what they want to do?
[00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:58.680]   If you have used the web OS, you know that it's really--
[00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:00.640]   it's a wonderful operating system.
[00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:04.080]   And I can see using those cards on a tablet,
[00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:07.720]   moving the cards around to multitask, looking them away.
[00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:11.840]   I think it would make an excellent web tablet.
[00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:13.000]   What was wrong with the pre?
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.840]   The only thing wrong with the pre was it was sluggish.
[00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:17.320]   The pre was sluggish.
[00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:19.920]   I actually think that the web OS would do better
[00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:22.280]   on a bigger screen.
[00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:28.600]   And it's a good operating system before maybe the 5 to 7-inch
[00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:29.480]   form factor.
[00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:32.480]   I don't think you necessarily have to get as big as the iPad.
[00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:35.280]   That one of the problems with Windows and all
[00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:37.480]   of these other desktop operating systems
[00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:40.400]   is that they're designed for mice and keyboards.
[00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:43.720]   And as Ryan said, that doesn't work necessarily.
[00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:44.200]   It's slayed.
[00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:45.120]   It's clunky.
[00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:47.680]   But the web OS, when you look at it and you've--
[00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:50.000]   It's a mobile OS.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:50.480]   Yes.
[00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:51.800]   Very much so.
[00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:54.920]   And actually, again, I think it would do better on a tablet
[00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:57.080]   than it has on the pre.
[00:31:57.080 --> 00:32:01.320]   I'm sure I'll see if you've seen Windows Mobile 7 phone--
[00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:05.000]   Windows Phone 7 Mobile.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:08.800]   And that is Microsoft's attempt to leave behind the legacy
[00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:11.160]   of desktop OS crammed into a small device
[00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:13.120]   and make something zoom-like for a phone.
[00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:17.360]   Is that going to be the fourth we've got Android web OS, iPad OS?
[00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:18.560]   Are we going to see-- or iPhone OS?
[00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:20.640]   Are we going to see--
[00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:24.200]   Is Windows 7 Phone Phone 7 going to be--
[00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:29.600]   aside from the bad name going to be the fourth in that group?
[00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:30.120]   Ryan--
[00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:32.000]   I'm going to start thinking about tablets.
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:36.520]   I mean, they're just now building a decent phone OS.
[00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:40.200]   And manufacturers are now looking to Microsoft
[00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:42.640]   for, well, what do we put on these tablets?
[00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:45.000]   And all Microsoft proved with the slate
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.320]   is that they don't know.
[00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:54.040]   The slate Windows 7 optimized tablet OS was hideous.
[00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:57.440]   There are rumors that we talked about that HP just doesn't want it.
[00:32:57.440 --> 00:33:01.960]   We're not going to use this because it just doesn't work.
[00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:06.760]   So that software was one of the two biggest problems
[00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:07.240]   with the slate.
[00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:09.000]   The other was battery life.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:13.840]   I think it was slated to have five and a half hours of battery life.
[00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:16.840]   Half the iPad.
[00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:19.000]   You know, the thing-- the one thing to remember here--
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.840]   and this has been, I think, a popular topic of conversation--
[00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:26.680]   how does Phone 7 fit into Microsoft's tablet strategy?
[00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:29.840]   Is there going to be a tablet optimized version of Phone 7?
[00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:33.840]   And if so, how could they continue to call it Phone 7?
[00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:37.040]   The thing to remember here, though, is that tablets--
[00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:39.560]   I mean, this is like the second coming of tablets, right?
[00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:40.840]   Tablets have been around for a long time.
[00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:41.920]   It's actually the fourth coming.
[00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:42.840]   But yeah.
[00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:43.440]   Yeah.
[00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:45.720]   Now they're kind of popular among consumers.
[00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:48.040]   But relatively speaking, not so much.
[00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:50.920]   I mean, we're talking about a potential market here
[00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:53.000]   of a few million units a year, which
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.600]   is great considering how few units tablets
[00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:58.760]   have sold over the last decade or so.
[00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:02.360]   But if you compare that to the phone space,
[00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:07.480]   they sell their few million phones moved every day.
[00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:09.640]   I mean, there are literally billions of phones sold.
[00:34:09.640 --> 00:34:10.560]   So--
[00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:11.120]   I mean, no key--
[00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:13.720]   No key puts everybody else to shame, really.
[00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:14.240]   Yeah.
[00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:16.200]   The mobile space is kind of old news, I think,
[00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:18.960]   to people like us and the people who are listening to Twit.
[00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:21.760]   But the fact is, that's where you want to be first.
[00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:25.200]   You got to really get your skin and game in the phone space,
[00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:28.360]   which is, again, I think why HP bought Palm.
[00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:30.720]   And once you've done that, once you kind of establish
[00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:32.760]   yourself as a player, then you can worry about the tablets.
[00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:34.560]   I'm not saying that they shouldn't worry about that.
[00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:36.360]   But I think they really need to worry a lot more
[00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:38.560]   about phones right now, because that's what's selling.
[00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:40.400]   That's what everybody's buying.
[00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:40.920]   Exactly.
[00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:43.480]   The tablet space is going to take a while to heat up.
[00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:46.160]   But what HP knows is the kind of form factor
[00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:50.040]   that is closer to the tablet than it is to phones,
[00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:51.480]   the stuff that they've done with phones
[00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:53.880]   have been frankly awful.
[00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:58.480]   And I think that they can give Palm the money and the R&D
[00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:00.200]   support.
[00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:06.920]   But in their corporate boardroom and in HP's own design
[00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:09.320]   group, they're drooling over this.
[00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:12.840]   And I think they're going to see if they can get some traction
[00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:14.480]   in the smartphone market.
[00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:17.760]   But if they can't, HP has a tendency, then,
[00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:21.680]   to take the intellectual property and absorb it
[00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:22.480]   into other products.
[00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:24.360]   It'll be on printers.
[00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:25.360]   Right.
[00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:27.080]   Look at what they did with Voodoo.
[00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:32.320]   They bought this really hot game PC company called Voodoo.
[00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:36.800]   And they started out by trying to take the Voodoo model
[00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:40.800]   with really hot souped up machines and HPIs it.
[00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:43.000]   And it didn't really work.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:44.800]   They tried a couple of different things.
[00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:46.960]   And now they've taken the technology
[00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:50.520]   that Voodoo had kind of championed and moved it back
[00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:54.720]   into their desktop and some of their notebook machines.
[00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:56.600]   And so I think what HP will do is they'll
[00:35:56.600 --> 00:36:00.840]   try to see if they could get Palm going, give it a second life.
[00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:02.560]   But I wouldn't give it--
[00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:05.120]   I wouldn't give them much more than a year, a year and a half
[00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:07.920]   before they say tech with it and wind up
[00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:09.760]   focusing on the stuff they know best, which
[00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:11.080]   is tablets and notebooks.
[00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:12.160]   You've got to think, though.
[00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:13.080]   I don't like WebOS.
[00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:14.280]   I thought it was very impressive.
[00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:16.360]   And you've got to think that the one thing Palm lacked
[00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:20.560]   was marketing ability, money, distribution channels,
[00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:23.360]   the one thing, like the eight things they lacked.
[00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:26.120]   Those ads with the red head were bizarre.
[00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:28.280]   They were on sprint.
[00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:32.080]   And given a company like HP with marketing,
[00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:35.160]   with channels, with plenty of cash,
[00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:38.880]   if WebOS is going to succeed, that's
[00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:41.360]   the best place for it to be, yes?
[00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:43.360]   They do need to get more phones out there.
[00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:44.240]   They're going to do phones.
[00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:45.600]   They're not known as a phone company.
[00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:46.600]   That's for sure.
[00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:47.400]   But Palm is.
[00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:48.560]   So if they could give--
[00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:51.040]   Maybe they keep the Palm brand.
[00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:51.600]   They may--
[00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:53.760]   I think you're going to see them keep the Palm brand.
[00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:55.400]   It's too good a brand to kill.
[00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:58.080]   Right, isn't there something called the C40?
[00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:02.400]   It's a next-gen pre called the C40 that's rumored to be
[00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:03.320]   coming to you the only thing about that.
[00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:05.240]   I have to say that when HP made the acquisition,
[00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:07.840]   they said we're going to double down on WebOS.
[00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:11.320]   They didn't talk about Palm phones, particularly.
[00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:13.240]   They really talked about WebOS, yes.
[00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:14.200]   So do you think--
[00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:16.320]   The phones at this point are almost secondary
[00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:18.000]   to the operating system.
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:21.200]   I mean, phones, if you really look at phone hardware,
[00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:23.320]   it hasn't really changed a whole lot
[00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:25.000]   in the past couple of years.
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:28.600]   I mean, once 3G has really become pervasive in the United
[00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:31.440]   States, there's not a whole lot left to do.
[00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:33.840]   I mean, you look at the last-gen iPhone,
[00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:36.400]   I guess the current-gen iPhone, the 3G
[00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:38.200]   as compared to the next iPhone, you're
[00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:39.920]   not going to see a lot of real differences.
[00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:41.720]   I mean, we're just talking about cameras, right?
[00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:43.920]   It's different cameras and kind of a different look
[00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:45.520]   and maybe a faster processor.
[00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:47.440]   But fundamentally, it's the same thing.
[00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:49.760]   So hardware is actually not really the interesting thing
[00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:50.280]   anymore.
[00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:51.360]   It's the OS.
[00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:52.560]   The phone hardware has become the--
[00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:53.440]   It's not even the OS.
[00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:54.320]   The OS, it's important.
[00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:55.080]   It's not even the OS.
[00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:56.040]   It's the apps.
[00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:56.360]   Yeah.
[00:37:56.360 --> 00:38:00.360]   Well, it's the apps that the OS has to have those apps.
[00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:03.000]   And I think that's where Palm kind of squandered.
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.680]   It's biggest opportunity here was they did not
[00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:08.160]   do a good enough job of getting developers to their platform.
[00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:10.560]   And that might have changed their fortunes
[00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:12.000]   before they sold HP.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.800]   Can HP do that?
[00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:17.280]   I don't think it's a matter of can HP do it or can--
[00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:18.560]   I think Palm could have done it.
[00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:21.400]   I think that they just didn't do it.
[00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:24.200]   They could have pushed harder that direction.
[00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:27.240]   And I think maybe they underestimated how important it was.
[00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:32.040]   It's fun because really everybody's guessing.
[00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:35.160]   And the future is slowly becoming clear.
[00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:36.760]   And I don't think anybody could have predicted
[00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:38.680]   that the iPad was going to be what the iPad is.
[00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:40.680]   I don't think when-- I know when Apple said we're going
[00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:43.000]   to do a phone, I thought, oh, God.
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:46.600]   How could they possibly succeed in this space?
[00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:50.840]   Who knew Apple didn't know that the apps would be all about the apps?
[00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:52.880]   When Apple released the iPhone, they said, no, no.
[00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:54.160]   You're going to do it on the web.
[00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:55.320]   We don't need apps.
[00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:57.680]   That means every step of the way, it's
[00:38:57.680 --> 00:39:01.120]   been unfolding and developing in an unusual and unexpected way,
[00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:02.680]   don't you think?
[00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:04.480]   Well, you don't think that Apple knew
[00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:06.080]   that they were going to put apps on the iPhone.
[00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:08.160]   But you think Steve Jobs-- it was disingenuous.
[00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:11.280]   Steve Jobs was saying, oh, you just develop web apps.
[00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:14.680]   And we don't have to-- you think he knew they were going to do an app store?
[00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:17.320]   Yeah, just the same way that he was talking
[00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:18.880]   about how terrible e-book readers are.
[00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:20.040]   And he wants to read e-books.
[00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:22.000]   Nobody wants to watch movies on a little screen.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:22.600]   Nobody wants to.
[00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:23.120]   Yeah.
[00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:23.640]   Yeah.
[00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:26.000]   I mean, this is a classic job.
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:29.080]   He tells you all the things that you shouldn't be doing with your company
[00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:33.560]   and all the technologies you shouldn't be developing at your company
[00:39:33.560 --> 00:39:35.400]   until he develops them.
[00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:37.720]   I mean, it's just-- it's a classic bait and switch.
[00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:41.080]   And he's totally diversionary.
[00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:42.080]   And that's fine.
[00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:43.320]   They do a really good job that way.
[00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:48.160]   But I mean, it's really nothing, the other way that he does that.
[00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:48.680]   Yeah.
[00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:49.520]   I don't know.
[00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:53.200]   Well, I guess-- look, they've been pretty smart, haven't they?
[00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:54.880]   Whatever they're doing.
[00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:57.520]   Steve Jobs wrote a long letter on apple.com
[00:39:57.520 --> 00:39:59.720]   about why we're not going with Flash.
[00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:01.400]   I would like to contrast that and compare it
[00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:09.320]   to a really great article by a Scottish blogger named Charlie Strauss.
[00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:11.280]   The real reason why Steve Jobs hates Flash.
[00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:13.360]   We'll talk about both of these.
[00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:16.280]   And a lot more about the tech news.
[00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:18.440]   This is a very interesting week.
[00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:20.800]   And there is, as I mentioned, Apple and Siri.
[00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:22.880]   There's some other stuff going on.
[00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:27.000]   A few other things going on out there.
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:30.560]   But before we get too far down that road,
[00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:32.720]   let's talk about one of our great sponsors, the folks
[00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:35.000]   at squarespace.com.
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.280]   Dane was out there in New York City visiting with them
[00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:38.440]   in their beautiful offices.
[00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:40.840]   And so I want a great bunch of people.
[00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:43.680]   Anthony and the other Dane and the gang,
[00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:45.360]   they started Squarespace in college
[00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:47.760]   when they were looking for a better blogging platform.
[00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:51.200]   But Squarespace now is so much more than a blogging platform.
[00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:54.000]   If you go to squarespace.com, you're
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.280]   going to see an incredible tool.
[00:40:56.280 --> 00:41:00.320]   It's hosting and a content management.
[00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:03.800]   And everything you need to bake a great website,
[00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:08.520]   go to squarespace.com/twit.
[00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:10.640]   You can try it free for a couple of weeks.
[00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:12.760]   And by the way, you can import all your content.
[00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:15.800]   If you're on a movable type blog or WordPress or TypePad
[00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:19.360]   or Blogger, seamless blog importing
[00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:22.840]   means you can just go there, set up a beautiful skin
[00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:24.160]   because they have some great templates.
[00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:26.400]   Import your content and see exactly what your blog would
[00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:28.440]   look like on the Squarespace platform.
[00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:30.160]   You never run out of bandwidth, by the way,
[00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:33.520]   their virtual server technology means
[00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:35.640]   that they can throw bandwidth at your site
[00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:38.160]   the minute it's needed.
[00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:40.000]   Great website started $8 a month.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.280]   And if you use Twit as the coupon code
[00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:45.760]   when you sign up for your website, when you decided to buy one,
[00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:49.480]   you'll get 10% off forever.
[00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:51.280]   10% off forever.
[00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:52.160]   I like that.
[00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:53.280]   Your Clayton's got a new site.
[00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:57.200]   I love Clayton's site on Squarespace.
[00:41:57.200 --> 00:41:59.760]   I think that picture is tongue in cheek.
[00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:01.120]   I hope so.
[00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:02.160]   Oh, he's saying he is a good guy.
[00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:03.720]   Oh, I love Clayton.
[00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:05.840]   Gadget sci-fi music sarcasm.
[00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:07.960]   There he is.
[00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:09.680]   All these great sites, this is a great way
[00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:12.040]   to get an idea of what Squarespace can do
[00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:15.040]   is in the examples section because unlike a lot of other
[00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:18.200]   platforms, there's no Squarespace look.
[00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:20.760]   You can make it look like anything you want.
[00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:21.480]   It's your site.
[00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:23.680]   Nobody's going to say, oh, yeah, I've seen that before.
[00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:24.480]   No, no, no.
[00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:25.360]   Every site is unique.
[00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:26.160]   Every site is different.
[00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:28.360]   Every site is beautiful.
[00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:31.720]   And you don't have to be a designer because the templates
[00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:35.480]   you start with and then the very simple configuration
[00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:37.520]   tools they provide you with make it so easy.
[00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:39.080]   You don't have to be a pro to have a site that
[00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:40.800]   looks like a pro designed it.
[00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:42.800]   You just need to go to squarespace.com.
[00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:44.880]   squarespace.com/twit.
[00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:47.080]   Try it out for two weeks.
[00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:48.840]   And if you're a photographer, you're
[00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:50.400]   going to love the galleries they have here.
[00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:51.360]   Just gorgeous.
[00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:53.520]   And if you know CSS, I mean, you can do anything.
[00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:55.040]   There's no limit to what you can do.
[00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:56.480]   JavaScript is CSS, of course.
[00:42:56.480 --> 00:42:58.840]   Great commenting system, great statistics.
[00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:01.200]   You guys, this guy's a wedding photographer.
[00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:02.120]   Really neat stuff.
[00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:04.720]   squarespace.com/twit.
[00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:07.680]   Do take a look, by the way, at the iPhone application.
[00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:10.760]   I cannot wait till the iPad version comes out.
[00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:12.840]   The best blogging software.
[00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:14.280]   squarespace.com/twit.
[00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:18.360]   We thank them so much for their support of this week in tech.
[00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:21.960]   Do you think Apple buying Siri says anything about Apple's
[00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:23.160]   plans?
[00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:28.160]   Siri is a very cool program that lets you talk to your iPhone
[00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:30.080]   and tell it things in natural language.
[00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:35.920]   Like book me a table for two tonight at French Laundry.
[00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:38.720]   And or what's the score in the Giants game?
[00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:40.200]   And it will give you the answers.
[00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:43.040]   It's really kind of the-- it's not search.
[00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:44.160]   It's kind of the next thing.
[00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:46.120]   I think Apple would love to get beyond search.
[00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:48.200]   They know Google owns that.
[00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:50.760]   Siri is a very interesting acquisition.
[00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:53.320]   Any thoughts on that Mark Millan?
[00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:55.200]   Yeah, Siri rocks.
[00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:57.120]   I actually use that quite a bit.
[00:43:57.120 --> 00:44:01.760]   There's two major problems with it in that the design is not
[00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:02.360]   very nice.
[00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:05.480]   It's not Apple-y at all.
[00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:08.160]   And one would assume that Apple buys it.
[00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:12.840]   Apple will take it under its wing and develop it with its--
[00:44:12.840 --> 00:44:15.080]   Or kill it like they just did with La La.
[00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:16.440]   I was going to say the exact same thing.
[00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:19.480]   I think that you could kiss Siri goodbye.
[00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:22.760]   So I guess with La La, they might still
[00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:26.800]   do a streaming kind of La La style iTunes.
[00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:28.720]   Or they might have just wanted the guys.
[00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:30.160]   Maybe they could do some things.
[00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:31.320]   That's maybe what they wanted Siri.
[00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:32.520]   They just want the guys, right?
[00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:35.680]   Obviously, there's some smart fellas behind it or gals.
[00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:38.080]   Oh, I think they're a lot of acuires happening.
[00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:41.040]   They like that voice capability.
[00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:42.440]   The natural language thing.
[00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:43.320]   The natural language.
[00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:45.760]   One of the things that's very cool if you have an Android
[00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:46.560]   2.1 or 2.2--
[00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:47.280]   I love that.
[00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:50.040]   I don't want you to do it now yet-- is the ability to talk to it
[00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:51.760]   into any text field.
[00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:56.720]   Well, what if they put in the next iPhone the ability not
[00:44:56.720 --> 00:44:59.240]   just to talk text into the fields,
[00:44:59.240 --> 00:45:03.240]   but for it to understand what you want, which is what Siri is.
[00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:05.840]   So I could see them taking that technology and building it
[00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:09.200]   into the iPhone OS and go with Google what better.
[00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:10.400]   That's what I was thinking.
[00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:13.560]   That search screen on the iPhone, which isn't very good,
[00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:16.440]   I could see that being just the Siri app built in.
[00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:20.040]   You slide over one home screen, and you
[00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:22.280]   get this fully featured search app that
[00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:23.960]   can pull from the internet and pull from the contents
[00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:24.720]   on your phone.
[00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:26.880]   And you can use voice to search through it.
[00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:30.480]   And it's like a digital assistant.
[00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:35.440]   I feel like Siri, the concept, is good enough to be something
[00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:37.240]   that's built directly into the phone
[00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:39.560]   and could replace their search function.
[00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:44.760]   It does seem to me that it's a direct response
[00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:47.120]   to Android 2.1.
[00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:50.280]   Has anybody tried the incredible I played with one yesterday?
[00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:51.320]   Of course you have one.
[00:45:51.320 --> 00:45:52.160]   I'm sure, Ryan.
[00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:53.520]   You like it?
[00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:54.000]   I do.
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:56.600]   What kind of battery life are you getting on camera?
[00:45:56.600 --> 00:45:57.960]   Yeah, no, it's a great phone.
[00:45:57.960 --> 00:46:01.480]   How about the battery life, though, guys?
[00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:02.280]   I mean, it's pretty good.
[00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:04.800]   It suffers from the same Android problems
[00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:08.400]   that every Android OS has suffered from in terms
[00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:09.680]   of battery life.
[00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:13.240]   You run things in the background and it starts to suck up.
[00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:17.120]   Suck up a lot of power, especially the Twitter apps.
[00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:18.560]   I'll sometimes forget, and I'll have
[00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:22.560]   Keepgoing, which is the one that comes with this particular HTC
[00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:23.720]   model made by HTC.
[00:46:23.720 --> 00:46:26.600]   And the new Twitter app I'll have running as well and just
[00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:27.160]   forget.
[00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:33.080]   And it'll be sucking down background power, both at the same time.
[00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:34.800]   That Twitter app sucks, by the way.
[00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:37.440]   Twitter's own app.
[00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:40.240]   It's not the best Android app.
[00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:42.160]   Seismix better.
[00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:43.160]   Twitter made it for them.
[00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:43.960]   Twitter made it.
[00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:47.920]   Well, it spends all this energy having clouds float around.
[00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:48.600]   I don't want clouds.
[00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:51.040]   I want functionality.
[00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:51.840]   You like it?
[00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:52.880]   Is that what you use?
[00:46:52.880 --> 00:46:53.560]   You use peep?
[00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:54.080]   You use that?
[00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:55.600]   Or what do you--
[00:46:55.600 --> 00:46:56.080]   Mark?
[00:46:56.080 --> 00:46:56.560]   I mean--
[00:46:56.560 --> 00:46:59.160]   I've been using peep for the most part, but it's decent.
[00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:03.760]   I mean, there's really not a whole lot that Twitter--
[00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:06.000]   main Twitter app developers can do, I guess.
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:07.000]   You're right.
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:08.400]   I mean, I guess you're right.
[00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:10.000]   It's Twitter's world.
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:10.720]   We just live in it.
[00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:14.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:15.640]   Let Twitter be Twitter.
[00:47:15.640 --> 00:47:18.280]   Right.
[00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:23.320]   I mean, they're really pushing these for app developers
[00:47:23.320 --> 00:47:25.880]   to go into these alternative spaces.
[00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:28.240]   They opened up that annotation feature
[00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:30.680]   because they want to see--
[00:47:30.680 --> 00:47:33.520]   I was talking to Jack Dorsey in New York a couple weeks ago.
[00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:36.320]   And he was like, sometimes developers need a push.
[00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:38.880]   Sometimes we need to say, we're going
[00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:41.240]   to create this base app for the phones.
[00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:42.840]   And we're going to have it for every platform.
[00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:44.480]   So you guys don't need to worry about that.
[00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:46.680]   Here are all these other cool things to play with.
[00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:50.040]   Don't worry about your revenue, your model, the application
[00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:52.200]   you spent six months writing.
[00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:53.280]   Don't worry about that.
[00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:54.600]   We got it.
[00:47:54.600 --> 00:47:55.280]   Well, I mean--
[00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:57.280]   They were just kind of boring with honest and fair.
[00:47:57.280 --> 00:48:00.680]   And I say this with all respect to my friends, like Loik,
[00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:02.640]   who he's done a great job with.
[00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:03.520]   He's Mick.
[00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:07.600]   But if you have built an entire business
[00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:12.040]   around somebody else's platform, you can't-- you're not allowed.
[00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:15.720]   I'm telling you, I am demanding that you not
[00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:18.440]   be surprised or shocked when something happens
[00:48:18.440 --> 00:48:21.000]   and the platform changes and your business models
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:21.440]   is messed up.
[00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:25.800]   You say there's no whining for parasites, not allowed.
[00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:27.200]   It's not that it's not allowed.
[00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:30.760]   It's just if you're going to put the entire well-being
[00:48:30.760 --> 00:48:32.960]   of your business on one single thing
[00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:35.480]   that Twitter could change in a heartbeat,
[00:48:35.480 --> 00:48:36.640]   or the Facebook could change in a heartbeat.
[00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:37.840]   Tell that to Mark Pinkis.
[00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:39.680]   They haven't done a very good job with your business.
[00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:42.320]   Tell that to Mr. Farmville.
[00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:45.120]   I wonder what they're thinking over there right now,
[00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:48.160]   because they're making an ungodly amount of money--
[00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:50.400]   Like half a billion dollars a year.
[00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:52.480]   Yeah, but that could change very quickly.
[00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:56.400]   I mean, what if Facebook tomorrow says, OK,
[00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:59.920]   we've had enough of these shady tactics that are going on
[00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:02.120]   with some of the games in our platform.
[00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:04.080]   So we're going to say no more games.
[00:49:04.080 --> 00:49:06.160]   And we're going to have an online gamehouse.
[00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:07.400]   We're going to own it.
[00:49:07.400 --> 00:49:08.240]   We're going to operate it.
[00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:11.240]   We're going to make our own Farmville and Sari Zinga.
[00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:14.160]   Maybe within the right to do that.
[00:49:14.160 --> 00:49:15.680]   This is the world we live in, by the way.
[00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:19.200]   If you're an Apple developer, you live and die
[00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:20.520]   by what Steve Jobs says.
[00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:24.760]   And if Heaven for Fenn, you're an Apple gaming platform,
[00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:30.000]   like Open Faint or Plus.
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:33.040]   And Apple says, we're going to do a gaming system.
[00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:34.240]   It's like, OK.
[00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:38.240]   Or if you're an AdMob type mobile ad platform,
[00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:40.000]   and Apple says, we're going to do I ads,
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:41.680]   I mean, this seems to be happening more and more,
[00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:42.040]   doesn't it?
[00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:46.600]   It used to be, in my day, Microsoft
[00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:48.880]   would do anything to appease developers,
[00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:50.680]   because you don't have a platform unless you have people
[00:49:50.680 --> 00:49:51.840]   developing for it.
[00:49:51.840 --> 00:49:54.880]   Now it really looks like these companies couldn't care less.
[00:49:54.880 --> 00:49:57.040]   The developers are like, we got you.
[00:49:57.040 --> 00:50:00.080]   You go wherever we say you go.
[00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:01.200]   I don't know about that.
[00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:02.600]   It's been happening for a while.
[00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:06.240]   You look at when Microsoft integrated Internet Explorer
[00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:08.720]   into Windows, and it's this free browser,
[00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:10.520]   so why are you going to pay for Netscape?
[00:50:10.520 --> 00:50:12.080]   And that completely changed the space.
[00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:12.280]   Killed Netscape.
[00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:13.720]   You're right.
[00:50:13.720 --> 00:50:17.800]   And something like Apple did it, what, like four or five
[00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:23.040]   years ago when Confabulator was this awesome widgets platform
[00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:25.640]   that Yahoo ends up buying turns into Yahoo widgets, and then--
[00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:26.560]   Dashboard.
[00:50:26.560 --> 00:50:29.000]   A year later, we get dashboard built in notice.
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:29.600]   I guess you're right.
[00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:30.960]   Maybe it's nothing new.
[00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:32.400]   You're an old fart like me, Dwight.
[00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:35.440]   Does it seem like it's something new?
[00:50:35.440 --> 00:50:39.400]   No, I was thinking about AOL, that when AOL had businesses
[00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:43.880]   that built up around it plugged into its client,
[00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:45.520]   and then suddenly they said--
[00:50:45.520 --> 00:50:47.640]   and there was some revenue derived from that,
[00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:49.960]   from businesses who contributed to the client.
[00:50:49.960 --> 00:50:54.320]   And then when AOL said, we're going to go free,
[00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:56.280]   and the client will be free, and everybody
[00:50:56.280 --> 00:50:58.880]   can connect, all of a sudden, a lot of these businesses,
[00:50:58.880 --> 00:51:00.280]   their value was much less.
[00:51:00.280 --> 00:51:01.480]   And now what is AOL?
[00:51:01.480 --> 00:51:02.920]   It's a collection of websites.
[00:51:02.920 --> 00:51:06.160]   So I think it happens a lot.
[00:51:06.160 --> 00:51:11.920]   AOL just sold an ICQ to a Russian developer for $187 million.
[00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:13.520]   I think that's actually a good deal.
[00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:16.280]   I think I take the money and run, although investors
[00:51:16.280 --> 00:51:21.640]   were hoping for more digital sky technologies, which, by the way,
[00:51:21.640 --> 00:51:27.040]   to tie this all together has a big stake in Facebook and Zynga.
[00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:27.720]   Skynet.
[00:51:27.720 --> 00:51:28.880]   It's Skynet.
[00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:30.480]   Digital Skynet technologies.
[00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:37.880]   Shares of AOL dropped $4 on this news.
[00:51:37.880 --> 00:51:39.200]   Well, maybe that's-- no, I'm sorry.
[00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:39.960]   It wasn't this news.
[00:51:39.960 --> 00:51:42.680]   It was the fact that their profit fell by 59%.
[00:51:42.680 --> 00:51:43.600]   That was that.
[00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:45.000]   Yeah, investors were like, no, I see Q.
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:46.000]   No, I see Q.
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:48.480]   We love you.
[00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:50.440]   How much do they pay for ICQ originally?
[00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:51.040]   Did they--
[00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:52.040]   Oh, that's a good question.
[00:51:52.040 --> 00:51:53.040]   In terms of like individual dollar.
[00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:54.600]   They did go $4 or $500 million.
[00:51:54.600 --> 00:51:55.560]   They lost a lot of money on that.
[00:51:55.560 --> 00:51:56.200]   They did.
[00:51:56.200 --> 00:51:56.880]   But not surprising.
[00:51:56.880 --> 00:52:02.240]   I mean, it was one of those web 1.0 properties clearly.
[00:52:02.240 --> 00:52:06.280]   Clearly is not going to go for what they bought it at in the '90s.
[00:52:06.280 --> 00:52:07.640]   Example of how things change.
[00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:11.120]   And at the time AOL had aim, and it seemed like a sensible thing
[00:52:11.120 --> 00:52:14.360]   to consolidate and own the instant messenger market.
[00:52:14.360 --> 00:52:15.800]   And things went differently.
[00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:16.560]   You know?
[00:52:16.560 --> 00:52:21.040]   I mean, for what it's worth, when you're talking
[00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:22.920]   about the instant messenger market, AOL still
[00:52:22.920 --> 00:52:24.400]   does pretty much own it.
[00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:27.080]   If you're talking about the kind of web-based IAM market,
[00:52:27.080 --> 00:52:31.080]   like G Chat and Facebook Chat, I mean, those are different.
[00:52:31.080 --> 00:52:34.400]   I would put those in a different space.
[00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:35.520]   That's only in the US, though.
[00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:37.880]   I mean, you look at worldwide stats and AMS.
[00:52:37.880 --> 00:52:39.840]   I don't even think it's in the top five.
[00:52:39.840 --> 00:52:41.920]   It's all about Windows Messenger and Skype.
[00:52:41.920 --> 00:52:43.120]   Skype is number one.
[00:52:43.120 --> 00:52:46.920]   And even Yahoo Messenger worldwide has a bigger market share
[00:52:46.920 --> 00:52:47.920]   than AIM.
[00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:50.120]   It was a real revelation to me when I went to Canada
[00:52:50.120 --> 00:52:53.120]   and the dominant-- I mean, totally dominant messengers
[00:52:53.120 --> 00:52:55.120]   is MSN Messenger.
[00:52:55.120 --> 00:52:56.320]   It isn't a lot of countries.
[00:52:56.320 --> 00:52:57.640]   Yeah, they don't aim.
[00:52:57.640 --> 00:52:59.000]   It's like, you're on what?
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:52:59.960]   They don't know.
[00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:02.280]   Maybe because it's America online, I don't know.
[00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:04.160]   But MSN is huge in Canada.
[00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:06.000]   And I think in a lot of countries.
[00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:07.720]   And I never used MSN Messenger.
[00:53:07.720 --> 00:53:13.440]   So I am just-- I think I am is a cautionary tale
[00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:20.200]   to Twitter and other of these systems
[00:53:20.200 --> 00:53:23.560]   that if you let it fragment into too many--
[00:53:23.560 --> 00:53:25.760]   you have too many dial tones and people can't talk to one
[00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:26.560]   another.
[00:53:26.560 --> 00:53:29.360]   It's just not going to-- nobody's going to succeed.
[00:53:29.360 --> 00:53:33.160]   You need one platform, one standard, preferably,
[00:53:33.160 --> 00:53:39.240]   in my opinion, open, which brings us to Steve Jobs' letter
[00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:42.120]   about why we're not using Flash.
[00:53:42.120 --> 00:53:43.200]   So I'm just curious.
[00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:44.400]   I'm not going to say what I think.
[00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:47.040]   What do you think of this letter?
[00:53:47.040 --> 00:53:49.400]   Let's start with-- let's go in the upper left corner
[00:53:49.400 --> 00:53:52.960]   of the block, Mr. Dwight Silverman.
[00:53:52.960 --> 00:53:56.000]   Well, I'm glad Steve Jobs finally wrote in his blog again.
[00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:57.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:53:57.200 --> 00:54:00.320]   It's been a long time since he's blogged.
[00:54:00.320 --> 00:54:02.880]   None of it was new.
[00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:06.280]   The stuff that he wrote he has said before,
[00:54:06.280 --> 00:54:10.200]   I found it interesting that he chose to write about that now
[00:54:10.200 --> 00:54:13.040]   with all of the other criticism that's been leveled
[00:54:13.040 --> 00:54:16.000]   at Apple that kind of he-- out of the blue popped up
[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:18.160]   and wrote about Flash.
[00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:21.000]   But well, it's kind of timely because CS5 just came out
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:23.520]   and he had clobbered the cross-platform development
[00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:24.520]   and then the iPads out.
[00:54:24.520 --> 00:54:26.800]   And a lot of people are saying, oh, well, OK,
[00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:29.880]   not going to have iPad Flash.
[00:54:29.880 --> 00:54:34.280]   I guess it's an exporter to developers.
[00:54:34.280 --> 00:54:40.800]   And the rest of us kind of just get to sit and critique it.
[00:54:40.800 --> 00:54:44.280]   But frankly, there was not much new there.
[00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:48.640]   And the tone in the attitude was almost condescending.
[00:54:48.640 --> 00:54:51.800]   And I keep thinking about those things
[00:54:51.800 --> 00:54:57.680]   that I've been reading on how he has a grudge against Adobe
[00:54:57.680 --> 00:55:01.440]   because of how Adobe kind of walked away from Apple
[00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:06.640]   when it was on its death throes and embraced windows.
[00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:09.440]   What do you think, Ryan?
[00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:12.280]   When you say condescending, condescending to who?
[00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:17.880]   I think he was trying to sound statesman-like,
[00:55:17.880 --> 00:55:21.920]   but it came off condescending to Adobe,
[00:55:21.920 --> 00:55:26.360]   condescending to those folks who support cross-platform
[00:55:26.360 --> 00:55:27.320]   development.
[00:55:27.320 --> 00:55:28.920]   I think he was kind of just saying--
[00:55:28.920 --> 00:55:33.080]   Let me read it my best Alex Trebek voice.
[00:55:33.080 --> 00:55:34.840]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:55:34.840 --> 00:55:40.320]   Flash was created during the PC era for PCs and mice.
[00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:42.400]   Flash is a successful business for Adobe.
[00:55:42.400 --> 00:55:46.240]   We can understand why they want to push it beyond PCs.
[00:55:46.240 --> 00:55:49.960]   But the mobile era, it's all about low-powered devices,
[00:55:49.960 --> 00:55:53.000]   touch interfaces, and open web standards.
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:57.120]   All areas were flash, all short.
[00:55:57.120 --> 00:55:58.320]   Yeah, that's condescending.
[00:55:58.320 --> 00:56:02.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:56:02.160 --> 00:56:03.360]   Nice job, Leo.
[00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:06.200]   You got to be Alex Trebek to really get the condescension
[00:56:06.200 --> 00:56:07.120]   in there, I think.
[00:56:07.120 --> 00:56:11.400]   I'm going to be squarely not on the side of Steve in particular,
[00:56:11.400 --> 00:56:15.160]   but in my opinion, anyone doing what they can
[00:56:15.160 --> 00:56:19.600]   to diminish the importance and reliance on Flash is doing
[00:56:19.600 --> 00:56:20.280]   a lot of work.
[00:56:20.280 --> 00:56:20.800]   I agree.
[00:56:20.800 --> 00:56:23.880]   I think in the long run, if everybody moves off of Flash
[00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:27.000]   and it looks like iPhone and iPad and iPod Touch
[00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:29.800]   is so important that a lot of sites are,
[00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:32.120]   that's a good thing in general.
[00:56:32.120 --> 00:56:33.240]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:56:33.240 --> 00:56:37.040]   I mean, Adobe argues that Flash is an open standard.
[00:56:37.040 --> 00:56:39.440]   I think that there are a lot of people who would argue against
[00:56:39.440 --> 00:56:41.800]   that either way, even if it isn't open standard,
[00:56:41.800 --> 00:56:43.600]   it's a standard controlled by one company,
[00:56:43.600 --> 00:56:45.160]   and it's no longer necessary.
[00:56:45.160 --> 00:56:47.600]   I mean, we're getting to the point now where
[00:56:47.600 --> 00:56:52.320]   the burgeoning HTML5 standards, CSS, JavaScript, and H.264
[00:56:52.320 --> 00:56:53.880]   completely negate the need for Flash.
[00:56:53.880 --> 00:56:57.680]   And there are the very real problems that Steve presented.
[00:56:57.680 --> 00:56:59.400]   And these are not new problems.
[00:56:59.400 --> 00:57:01.800]   These have always been problems with Flash.
[00:57:01.800 --> 00:57:04.200]   If you've ever looked at what happens to your computer's
[00:57:04.200 --> 00:57:07.840]   resources when you're running a lot of Flash, you know.
[00:57:07.840 --> 00:57:12.360]   The idea that Flash does not consume a lot of your CPU,
[00:57:12.360 --> 00:57:15.080]   that it doesn't run down your battery faster,
[00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:20.680]   that it is every bit as high performing as native web
[00:57:20.680 --> 00:57:24.240]   technologies, I mean, it's just completely false.
[00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:26.120]   You can't really argue with these facts.
[00:57:26.120 --> 00:57:28.640]   So the one thing that you can do is kind of say, well,
[00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:30.200]   here are the things that Flash is good for.
[00:57:30.200 --> 00:57:32.840]   Here are the things that Flash is needed for right now.
[00:57:32.840 --> 00:57:33.880]   And there are a few things.
[00:57:33.880 --> 00:57:36.760]   But the number of those things that Flash is needed for
[00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:39.120]   is decreasing almost by the day.
[00:57:39.120 --> 00:57:40.640]   And that is part of the reason why
[00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:43.200]   Jobs is letters so timely.
[00:57:43.200 --> 00:57:43.720]   And frankly--
[00:57:43.720 --> 00:57:45.160]   You don't think there's not a lot to argue
[00:57:45.160 --> 00:57:45.880]   within that letter.
[00:57:45.880 --> 00:57:46.400]   Well--
[00:57:46.400 --> 00:57:48.560]   It's very accurate overall.
[00:57:48.560 --> 00:57:50.240]   But he kind of neglected the fact
[00:57:50.240 --> 00:57:53.440]   that it's also really good business for Apple
[00:57:53.440 --> 00:57:55.520]   to screw Adobe, right?
[00:57:55.520 --> 00:57:58.720]   Well, in what regard?
[00:57:58.720 --> 00:58:00.960]   Well, I think you could talk about the fact
[00:58:00.960 --> 00:58:05.000]   that Apple doesn't want cross-platform development on its
[00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:08.440]   iPhone and iPad, because then somebody might develop an
[00:58:08.440 --> 00:58:11.200]   application for other people besides just Apple.
[00:58:11.200 --> 00:58:13.840]   They want to kind of completely hog the space.
[00:58:13.840 --> 00:58:15.160]   No, I don't think that's good for Apple.
[00:58:15.160 --> 00:58:16.960]   Not necessarily good for users.
[00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:19.160]   Steve says it's good for users, but is it?
[00:58:19.160 --> 00:58:22.120]   I mean, I think that no company has ever been able to fill
[00:58:22.120 --> 00:58:28.840]   on the promise of right once run anywhere in a way that is
[00:58:28.840 --> 00:58:33.160]   actually as high quality as an app that's been written native
[00:58:33.160 --> 00:58:34.280]   for a platform.
[00:58:34.280 --> 00:58:36.440]   And when we're talking about the mobile space, it's not
[00:58:36.440 --> 00:58:37.760]   enough for it to just run.
[00:58:37.760 --> 00:58:40.600]   It has to run and do things that are optimized to the
[00:58:40.600 --> 00:58:41.400]   experience.
[00:58:41.400 --> 00:58:45.320]   And so when I'm thinking about the mobile apps that we might
[00:58:45.320 --> 00:58:48.640]   do for our site, it had never even occurred to me.
[00:58:48.640 --> 00:58:49.640]   Well, I mean, it occurred to me.
[00:58:49.640 --> 00:58:53.160]   But it was never a possibility in my mind that we would do
[00:58:53.160 --> 00:58:55.920]   a cross-platform kind of one of those crappy apps like
[00:58:55.920 --> 00:58:56.800]   PhoneGap or whatever.
[00:58:56.800 --> 00:58:59.760]   Because you need to write native to the platform that
[00:58:59.760 --> 00:59:00.600]   you're running it in.
[00:59:00.600 --> 00:59:02.560]   And if you're going to be able to take advantage of the
[00:59:02.560 --> 00:59:05.040]   technologies of the platform, you just have to do that.
[00:59:05.040 --> 00:59:09.000]   So for Apple to be beholden to anybody else's technology, when
[00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:13.680]   they're trying to build an app ecosystem on their platform
[00:59:13.680 --> 00:59:14.480]   is crazy.
[00:59:14.480 --> 00:59:17.680]   And I think that anybody else should be taking that
[00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:18.120]   stance too.
[00:59:18.120 --> 00:59:21.160]   I think Microsoft, Palm, Android, they should all be
[00:59:21.160 --> 00:59:24.440]   looking at this in the exact same way, which is you need to
[00:59:24.440 --> 00:59:28.240]   be writing apps that are meant for this platform.
[00:59:28.240 --> 00:59:29.480]   You agree, Mark?
[00:59:29.480 --> 00:59:32.560]   What was your take on this jobs letter?
[00:59:32.560 --> 00:59:35.720]   I don't totally buy the--
[00:59:35.720 --> 00:59:38.480]   like that there's this fear from Apple that everybody's going
[00:59:38.480 --> 00:59:42.240]   to start making games for Flash and not for the iPhone.
[00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:47.000]   Games for Flash just really aren't that good in general.
[00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:48.880]   And for the most part, Ryan's right.
[00:59:48.880 --> 00:59:52.240]   HTML5 is really catching up to Flash and what it can do.
[00:59:52.240 --> 00:59:56.440]   There are HTML5 games that I've played on my iPhone.
[00:59:56.440 --> 00:59:58.480]   I think the site is called Akia Bora.
[00:59:58.480 --> 00:59:59.280]   And there's this little--
[00:59:59.280 --> 01:00:01.720]   Oh, yeah, that's a great site, yeah.
[01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:02.800]   Yeah, and it works on the iPhone.
[01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:04.400]   It works on the iPad.
[01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:08.040]   I agree with the underlying principles of moving beyond
[01:00:08.040 --> 01:00:11.120]   Flash because, really, Flash sucks.
[01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:13.240]   But it's still everywhere.
[01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:18.040]   And maybe this push from Apple, this is a push that the
[01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:23.240]   internet needs in order to get rid of this proprietary
[01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:23.720]   standard.
[01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:32.440]   But I still am annoyed when I go to, like, Gocker TV or
[01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:35.120]   New YorkTimes.com and hit a video that's in Flash and I
[01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:35.680]   just can't view it.
[01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:36.280]   What am I going to say?
[01:00:36.280 --> 01:00:38.880]   Oh, well, it's not important because it's made in Flash.
[01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:40.800]   I'm just not going to watch it.
[01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:46.120]   OK, Akia Bora is a HTML5 library that allows you very
[01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:51.240]   easily, I guess, to create an 16-bit era games in
[01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:53.960]   JavaScript that run an HTML5 browsers.
[01:00:53.960 --> 01:01:00.240]   It's kesiev.com/akihabara.
[01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:03.200]   It's certainly a good demo.
[01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:05.920]   Have you been following the--
[01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:08.280]   see, one of the things that HTML5 is going to have to
[01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:13.600]   resolve is what video codec to use.
[01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:20.320]   And this is suddenly emerging as a huge fight because H.264,
[01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:26.520]   which kind of has the inside track on all of this, is not
[01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:27.760]   open.
[01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:32.280]   It's owned by MPEG-LA, which charges $5 million as its
[01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:34.520]   license fee.
[01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:37.600]   So Mozilla, among others, there's the HTML5 conference
[01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:40.400]   that's coming up, is saying we're not going to support H.264.
[01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:42.000]   We don't want to pay the license fee.
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:45.640]   Plus, we believe it should not be a patented technology.
[01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:49.120]   They're going to support Og Theora, or maybe a Google's
[01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:53.160]   VPA, which they got when they bought on to.
[01:01:53.160 --> 01:02:00.880]   And there's a real kind of battle going on around H.264.
[01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:03.120]   I'll point you to some articles.
[01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:04.000]   BNET has an article.
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:07.760]   And the mobile video standards fight consumers are poised
[01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:12.840]   to lose if H.264 wins.
[01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:18.880]   For instance, I didn't know this.
[01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:22.960]   If you buy a camcorder that supports A, V, C, H, D, which
[01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:26.880]   is an H.264 standard, you probably know about this, Ryan.
[01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:29.360]   There is, in the license fee, says you may not use this cam
[01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:32.040]   quarter for commercial work.
[01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:33.160]   Yeah, it's tricky.
[01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:36.920]   And the thing with Og, and this is part of the reason
[01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:41.320]   why Google bought onto it in order to get VPA.
[01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:43.280]   Part of the thing with Og is, although it was developed
[01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:46.760]   to be open source, there's still a lot of debate that it's
[01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:49.520]   still using, or I should say, kind of overlapping some
[01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:55.800]   of the intellectual property that is created by the Ampeh
[01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:59.200]   LA, which owns H.264 and some of these other things.
[01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:02.400]   It's never intentional, but it's like there are only so
[01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:04.280]   many ways to skin a cat, so to speak.
[01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:07.240]   And there are some times where you may not know that you're
[01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:09.720]   infringing on other people's intellectual property, and
[01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:10.400]   you are.
[01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:14.560]   So some companies have actually shied away from Og because
[01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:19.000]   they think that they might get submarines in a patent case.
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.440]   Much as HTC, and we'll talk about this, and Microsoft,
[01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:23.280]   the Linux issue.
[01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:24.480]   Because Microsoft--
[01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:25.080]   Exactly.
[01:03:25.080 --> 01:03:27.840]   So IE9 says, Microsoft says, we're going to support
[01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:30.480]   H.264 only.
[01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:33.440]   Opera and Firefox says, we're not going to support H.264.
[01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:37.280]   So HTML5 is not in the clear, by any means.
[01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:39.720]   Well, this doesn't relate to HTML5 directly.
[01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:42.880]   HTML5 will continue to move ahead with or without these
[01:03:42.880 --> 01:03:43.320]   codecs.
[01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:45.560]   But you've got to settle on a standard.
[01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:48.560]   Yeah, but again, that standard has nothing to do with
[01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:49.520]   HTML5.
[01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:52.400]   HTML5 is a standard for markup on the web, and for
[01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:54.120]   displaying this content.
[01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:56.600]   The codec is-- that's at the browser level, and that has
[01:03:56.600 --> 01:04:00.320]   to be worked out, but it's not going to delay the roll out
[01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:01.480]   of HTML5 itself.
[01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:04.280]   It will just delay how long it takes for us to move away
[01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:05.760]   from flash-based video.
[01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:08.760]   Right.
[01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:13.400]   Steve Jobs sent an email out on April 30th.
[01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:15.760]   I love how Steve is talking to people now through email.
[01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:16.840]   This is his new method.
[01:04:16.840 --> 01:04:23.640]   Hugo Roy sent him an email questioning this choice over
[01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:26.520]   H.264 over Ogg, and so forth.
[01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:29.680]   And Jobs said exactly what you said, Ryan, in his
[01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:32.480]   response, sent from my iPad, by the way.
[01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:34.640]   All video codecs are covered by patents.
[01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:38.160]   A patent pool is being assembled to go after Theora,
[01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:41.240]   another quote open source codecs now.
[01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:43.040]   Unfortunately, just because something is open source
[01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:45.560]   doesn't mean or guarantee that it doesn't infringe on
[01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:48.160]   others' patents, an open standard is different from being
[01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:49.280]   royalty-free or open source.
[01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:50.760]   But that's a long response for Steve.
[01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:52.600]   He usually doesn't type so much on us.
[01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:53.920]   Easy just says, nope.
[01:04:53.920 --> 01:04:55.840]   Yep, nope.
[01:04:55.840 --> 01:04:57.720]   It's a complicated issue, though.
[01:04:57.720 --> 01:05:00.840]   I mean, we like to think that just because something is open
[01:05:00.840 --> 01:05:03.120]   source doesn't-- it means that it's not going to be
[01:05:03.120 --> 01:05:04.680]   affected by these technologies.
[01:05:04.680 --> 01:05:07.240]   The thing is, like I said, sometimes you don't know.
[01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:09.520]   You don't know what you don't know.
[01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:12.600]   And so as you're building out Ogg, you might be infringing
[01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:16.240]   on some obscure MPEG-LA IP.
[01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:20.200]   And then you've gotten away so far because it hasn't really
[01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:21.240]   been widely used.
[01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:24.640]   But at some point, MPEG-LA or other players might decide
[01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:25.600]   that they want to go after you.
[01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:27.000]   So maybe VP8 is the way to go.
[01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.720]   Because at least you know Google wants to keep it open, right?
[01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:30.400]   Well, they want to.
[01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:32.280]   But they haven't made a completely open license yet.
[01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:33.920]   And I think people are assuming that that's what's going to
[01:05:33.920 --> 01:05:36.520]   happen, but we don't know.
[01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:38.160]   That could solve the problem.
[01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:42.120]   Part of what we've been kind of waiting for is to know what
[01:05:42.120 --> 01:05:44.560]   the MPEG-LA is actually going to do with H.264.
[01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:47.760]   So they've kept it on a pseudo open license where it doesn't
[01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:50.440]   cost anything to implement, I think, until like 2012 or
[01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:51.400]   something like that.
[01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:52.120]   Come on in.
[01:05:52.120 --> 01:05:54.280]   That's a fine choose.
[01:05:54.280 --> 01:05:54.880]   Come on.
[01:05:54.880 --> 01:05:55.720]   Use that code there.
[01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:58.240]   You're going to love H.264.
[01:05:58.240 --> 01:05:59.440]   It's up to adopted.
[01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:01.200]   And then they hit you.
[01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:01.960]   So not.
[01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:02.680]   We don't know.
[01:06:02.680 --> 01:06:03.160]   We don't know.
[01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:06.160]   But why take the chance?
[01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:07.280]   Yeah, it's tricky.
[01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:09.720]   But I mean, this is a problem with Flash, too.
[01:06:09.720 --> 01:06:13.960]   Because Flash is continually using H.264 as the video
[01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:16.280]   codec behind the player.
[01:06:16.280 --> 01:06:20.160]   YouTube has moved to H.264 as the video codec behind all of
[01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:21.720]   their videos.
[01:06:21.720 --> 01:06:23.600]   And it's still playing in a Flash player.
[01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:26.360]   But if you swap out the player for an HTML5 player, you
[01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:29.520]   still have the IP issues of which codec you're using.
[01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:32.280]   So I mentioned Charlie Strass and his blog, Charlie's Diary.
[01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:34.200]   We tried to get Charlie on the show, and he never heard a
[01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:34.520]   Twitch.
[01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:36.040]   So he says, I'm busy.
[01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:38.080]   But he's in Scotland.
[01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:39.200]   Why should he bother?
[01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:42.560]   But he wrote-- I thought this was very interesting--
[01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:45.440]   anti-pope.org, his blog.
[01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:46.240]   I've got a theory.
[01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:46.680]   And it's this.
[01:06:46.680 --> 01:06:50.960]   Steve Jobs believes he's gambling Apple's future on an
[01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:55.120]   all-or-nothing push into a new market.
[01:06:55.120 --> 01:06:58.320]   HP have woken up and smelled the forest fire two or three
[01:06:58.320 --> 01:06:59.840]   years late.
[01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:04.000]   Microsoft are mired in a tarpit, unable to grasp that the
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.920]   inferno heading towards them is going to burn down the
[01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:09.400]   entire ecosystem in which they exist.
[01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:12.080]   There's a smell of panic in the air.
[01:07:12.080 --> 01:07:14.280]   And here's why.
[01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:16.320]   He says, we've known since the '90s that the internet was
[01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:19.320]   the future of computing with increased bandwidth.
[01:07:19.320 --> 01:07:21.520]   Data doesn't need to be trapped in the hard drives of our
[01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:22.520]   desktop computers.
[01:07:22.520 --> 01:07:25.120]   Data and interaction could follow us out into the world we
[01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:27.280]   live.
[01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:30.680]   He says, mobile is where it's happening.
[01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:35.160]   And the PC industry is dying because margins in the PC
[01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:36.680]   industry are so razor thin.
[01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:40.240]   He says, PCs are becoming commodity items.
[01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:43.640]   With margins of typical netbooks or desktop PCs under 10%
[01:07:43.640 --> 01:07:46.040]   Apple survived because they make a premium product.
[01:07:46.040 --> 01:07:49.000]   But he believes in the long run.
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:50.760]   It's not going to be the PC that survives.
[01:07:50.760 --> 01:07:54.560]   It's the iPhone, OS, the iPad.
[01:07:54.560 --> 01:07:56.960]   Isn't just the start of a whole new range of Apple
[01:07:56.960 --> 01:07:58.800]   computers.
[01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:01.680]   He says it's a hugely ambitious attempt to keep Apple
[01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:04.480]   relevant to the future of computing.
[01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:07.200]   Once Moore's law tapers off and the personal computer
[01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:10.320]   industry craters and turns into a profitability
[01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:12.520]   wasteland.
[01:08:12.520 --> 01:08:14.840]   Steve has realized that ownership of the channel is
[01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:15.960]   everything.
[01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:19.760]   The iTunes store, the App Store, he says, even if he's
[01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:22.600]   reduced to giving away the machines, as long as he can
[01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:24.880]   charge rent for access to data or apps, he's got a
[01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:25.600]   business model.
[01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:27.480]   Does that make sense?
[01:08:27.480 --> 01:08:30.760]   He calls it the Mac Pop Mac, Macapop-alux.
[01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:32.040]   I can't pronounce it.
[01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:35.000]   The Mac apocalypse.
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:38.360]   In fact, the Apple design awards at the WWDC will only be
[01:08:38.360 --> 01:08:38.720]   open.
[01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:40.880]   And this was kind of interesting tea leaves.
[01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:45.000]   The only open iPhone and iPad apps, no OS X apps will be
[01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.680]   offered a design award.
[01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:52.880]   Shocked silence from the panel.
[01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:54.920]   I think this is not new.
[01:08:54.920 --> 01:08:55.920]   It's not new.
[01:08:55.920 --> 01:08:59.960]   You see if you look at WebOS, if you look at phone 7, even
[01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:02.720]   to a certain extent Android, everybody wants to own their
[01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:03.360]   ecosystem.
[01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:04.920]   But are we in a post PC era?
[01:09:04.920 --> 01:09:06.480]   I mean, is that why?
[01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:10.400]   No, I think it's way too early to make any claims like that.
[01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:12.280]   I would say the PC could link that.
[01:09:12.280 --> 01:09:14.480]   You know, you're silonning Dwight.
[01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:19.040]   If you would do something magical, I don't know what.
[01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:20.760]   It's been exactly one hour.
[01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:24.080]   It's something about this chipset after one hour.
[01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:25.360]   It starts doing this weird thing.
[01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:27.440]   And all you have to do is unplug and plug it in again.
[01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:29.920]   And then suddenly the driver reloads or something.
[01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:33.200]   It's like a memory leak in the thing.
[01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:34.560]   That's a nice chair, by the way, Dwight.
[01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:39.520]   It is all better.
[01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:40.000]   OK.
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:40.960]   Yes.
[01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:43.160]   So I think this is-- I think--
[01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:44.200]   I agree with Ryan.
[01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:46.880]   I don't believe that this is new.
[01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:49.840]   And people have been predicting the end of the PC.
[01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:50.520]   I know.
[01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:52.640]   I remember asking-- it was at Commdex.
[01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:54.880]   That's how long ago it was asking.
[01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:56.880]   And chairman of Intel is a PC dead.
[01:09:56.880 --> 01:09:58.640]   He said, what are you talking about?
[01:09:58.640 --> 01:10:04.400]   And of course, Apple sees things from its own perspective.
[01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:10.000]   I think that open is good and open wins a lot of times.
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:14.720]   Whether it wins in the mobile space and in the--
[01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:18.400]   when you're connecting to telecom broadband networks,
[01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:20.320]   whether it wins, I don't know yet,
[01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:22.160]   we'll see what happens with Android.
[01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:25.040]   But I think that Apple is planning on that.
[01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:30.320]   And that big, mysterious data center out in North Carolina,
[01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:34.160]   I think is for iTunes.com and a lot of other services.
[01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:37.240]   The next law law, that's where law law will be.
[01:10:37.240 --> 01:10:39.840]   But I think Apple will always build--
[01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:42.000]   I mean, they have a lot of infrastructure
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:47.080]   and a lot of design investment in MacBooks, MacBook Pros,
[01:10:47.080 --> 01:10:52.040]   maybe less so now in the iMac and the desktops.
[01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:56.880]   But I think that you will see PCs go on for a long, long time.
[01:10:56.880 --> 01:11:01.800]   I mean, look, the refrigerator market is--
[01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:05.200]   everybody has a refrigerator, but there's definitely
[01:11:05.200 --> 01:11:06.680]   a refrigerator industry.
[01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:08.520]   No, but that's saying it's saturated.
[01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:09.640]   I don't think it's saturated.
[01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:10.960]   I think that it no longer serves us.
[01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:12.960]   It with lightweight, portable devices,
[01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:15.120]   ubiquitous high-speed mobile internet.
[01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:16.640]   Who needs a PC?
[01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:19.160]   Well, I think it depends on the work you're doing.
[01:11:19.160 --> 01:11:21.640]   If you are editing high-definition video,
[01:11:21.640 --> 01:11:23.560]   you don't want to do that on a iPad.
[01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:24.680]   Well, some people do that, but that's
[01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:25.920]   a small minority of people.
[01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:26.640]   That's small.
[01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:29.120]   I think you want the appropriate tool for the job.
[01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:31.080]   But you have to have a PC to write iPad apps.
[01:11:31.080 --> 01:11:32.280]   People are going to have PCs.
[01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:34.200]   I'm not saying they're gone.
[01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:36.560]   I think normal people, though, may be much less interested
[01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:38.120]   in PCs in five years.
[01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:39.840]   That's the point here.
[01:11:39.840 --> 01:11:42.760]   And if you are HP, see, don't you
[01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:45.360]   think for all the stroking HP did to Microsoft
[01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:49.920]   that really HP is looking past in up to a post-windows time?
[01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:53.200]   I think every company that deals with Microsoft
[01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:55.080]   and has dealt with Microsoft for a long time
[01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:57.240]   would like there to be a post-Microsoft car.
[01:11:57.240 --> 01:11:58.320]   I mean, that's it.
[01:11:58.320 --> 01:11:59.200]   I know Intel did.
[01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:00.280]   I know Craig Verick.
[01:12:00.280 --> 01:12:01.680]   No, it was Andy Grove.
[01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:02.800]   That's how long ago it was.
[01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:04.640]   I remember I was talking to him, and he was off camera
[01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:05.320]   and off the record.
[01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:07.400]   He said, I hate Microsoft.
[01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:08.680]   I hate them.
[01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:11.240]   Tilt them.
[01:12:11.240 --> 01:12:11.520]   All right.
[01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:13.160]   I think it's an interesting conversation.
[01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:14.520]   Maybe it's premature to ask this.
[01:12:14.520 --> 01:12:18.200]   But I wouldn't be surprised if in five or 10 years
[01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:20.840]   we'll look back and we say, oh, yeah, this was kind of--
[01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:22.640]   the PC kind of started to go away.
[01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:23.840]   It's a commodity market.
[01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:26.640]   It's a razor thin margins.
[01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:30.040]   And frankly, consumers want something easier, simpler, portable.
[01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:31.600]   No?
[01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:33.720]   This is a watershed month, I think.
[01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:34.920]   That's what I think.
[01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:38.680]   I think it's-- I think that certainly 10 years from now,
[01:12:38.680 --> 01:12:44.160]   you can go back and if MP3 files are still supported on the web,
[01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:45.240]   you can go back and listen to this.
[01:12:45.240 --> 01:12:49.760]   But I'll do a prediction that the release of the iPad,
[01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:56.280]   the acquisition of Palm, the posturing over Flash,
[01:12:56.280 --> 01:13:01.080]   and everything that you've been seeing right now,
[01:13:01.080 --> 01:13:05.400]   right down to Jason Chen's computer is being confiscated.
[01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:08.360]   Because it's all part of the same story, right?
[01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:10.880]   Is going to be considered-- this is going to be a watershed time
[01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:13.240]   in tech.
[01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:16.400]   Agreed to Ryan Block?
[01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:17.240]   I think so.
[01:13:17.240 --> 01:13:18.920]   But I think people are--
[01:13:18.920 --> 01:13:20.440]   I mean, you already touched on this.
[01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:24.680]   I think people are very quick and almost sometimes
[01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:28.360]   a little bit gleeful to predict the death of the PC.
[01:13:28.360 --> 01:13:29.920]   I don't see it going anywhere.
[01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:35.880]   I see there as being-- very possibly being a new third device
[01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:38.480]   that people care about, and that's the tablet.
[01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:40.120]   But even that is yet to be seen.
[01:13:40.120 --> 01:13:41.120]   Yeah, no, no, no.
[01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:45.000]   I would say with iPad having used it
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:48.560]   and seeing how it fits into my life personally,
[01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:50.720]   that I think other people will find
[01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:54.080]   that this is a really great computing experience.
[01:13:54.080 --> 01:13:56.320]   But it is not yet proven.
[01:13:56.320 --> 01:13:59.080]   If you really look at things, we all
[01:13:59.080 --> 01:13:59.960]   kind of take it for granted.
[01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:03.000]   But not everybody who owns a PC has one of these yet,
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:03.640]   obviously.
[01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:07.200]   And it's going to be years before we know if this is actually
[01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:10.480]   just kind of a flash in the pan.
[01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:15.760]   And meanwhile, Lucid Lynx comes out, Ubuntu 10.04.
[01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:16.400]   They march on.
[01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:17.360]   They soldier on.
[01:14:17.360 --> 01:14:18.440]   How about you, Mark Millian?
[01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:20.800]   You're a young person.
[01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:21.840]   People of huge.
[01:14:21.840 --> 01:14:22.640]   What do they think?
[01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:25.360]   I'm just glad we get to see a lot of the bickering between the big
[01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:27.800]   companies happening out in the open.
[01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:29.840]   I mean, for the most part with HP, they're like,
[01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:31.040]   we love you, Microsoft.
[01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:35.000]   But we bought this company and they're a direct competitor
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:36.280]   in many spaces.
[01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:40.760]   But I'm glad that the Apple Adobe thing has finally
[01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:42.200]   come out in the open.
[01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:45.040]   Among people who watch that space closely, it was like, yeah.
[01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:46.320]   It's obvious.
[01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:46.840]   It's obvious.
[01:14:46.840 --> 01:14:47.640]   They hate each other.
[01:14:47.640 --> 01:14:48.600]   There's dispute there.
[01:14:48.600 --> 01:14:53.520]   And now Steve Jobs is writing opuses about how much he
[01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:54.200]   hates flash.
[01:14:54.200 --> 01:14:56.320]   And Adobe's coming out and blasting the same.
[01:14:56.320 --> 01:14:57.960]   That's what we're the open platform.
[01:14:57.960 --> 01:14:59.520]   And Apple's saying, we're the open platform.
[01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:01.840]   Neither of them are open.
[01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:02.760]   It's not a new era.
[01:15:02.760 --> 01:15:04.040]   It's not a post PC era.
[01:15:04.040 --> 01:15:08.120]   It's a new era of CEO bickering.
[01:15:08.120 --> 01:15:09.000]   I love it.
[01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:10.960]   Yeah, most funds were really entertaining.
[01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:12.520]   It is very entertaining.
[01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:13.000]   All right.
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.360]   We're going to take a break when we come back.
[01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:18.040]   Some interesting acquisition news and more.
[01:15:18.040 --> 01:15:19.440]   Google just acquired bump top.
[01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:19.800]   I don't know.
[01:15:19.800 --> 01:15:21.200]   Maybe the desktop isn't dead.
[01:15:21.200 --> 01:15:25.320]   It's just going to be 3D.
[01:15:25.320 --> 01:15:26.280]   Before we do that, I want to mention
[01:15:26.280 --> 01:15:28.720]   audible.com, the great bookstore.
[01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:30.440]   75,000 titles.
[01:15:30.440 --> 01:15:33.320]   I just got the new count in the Audible store.
[01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:35.400]   If you love listening, and I know you do,
[01:15:35.400 --> 01:15:36.560]   you wouldn't be listening to Twitter.
[01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:37.560]   You're going to love Audible.
[01:15:37.560 --> 01:15:40.680]   Audible is all about audio books.
[01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:44.000]   So if you've found it difficult to find time to read
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:47.880]   and who doesn't in this busy world, this is your savior.
[01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:49.280]   Listen in the car and the commute.
[01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:52.200]   Listen in the gym.
[01:15:52.200 --> 01:15:54.760]   Listen when you're on your bike or taking a walk,
[01:15:54.760 --> 01:16:00.880]   walking the dog, by doing this, you suddenly find time.
[01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:05.480]   And I've listened to at least two books a month.
[01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:07.840]   Somebody said, you can't call it reading Leo
[01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:11.040]   because the brain apprehends the information
[01:16:11.040 --> 01:16:12.000]   in a different form.
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:13.680]   Well, every word in the book's there.
[01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:14.840]   I don't know if it's reading or not,
[01:16:14.840 --> 01:16:17.880]   but boy, you sure get the words in there.
[01:16:17.880 --> 01:16:24.320]   And there's so many great things from the nonfiction
[01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:27.440]   history I'm listening right now to the history of the campaign,
[01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:31.960]   the 2008 presidential campaign, just fascinating.
[01:16:31.960 --> 01:16:34.760]   Two great fiction stories.
[01:16:34.760 --> 01:16:36.320]   I'm listening to Time Traveler's wife.
[01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:41.600]   I like to listen to books that were movies before I see the movie.
[01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:44.720]   Two stories of things like The Beatles and oral history,
[01:16:44.720 --> 01:16:46.440]   Volume 1, The Formation of the Band.
[01:16:46.440 --> 01:16:49.240]   I mean, audio brings things to life.
[01:16:49.240 --> 01:16:51.240]   Movies in your mind.
[01:16:51.240 --> 01:16:53.360]   Now you can go to audible.com/twit2
[01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:54.600]   and get two books free.
[01:16:54.600 --> 01:16:56.160]   You'll sign up for the platinum account.
[01:16:56.160 --> 01:16:57.760]   That's what I have, two books a month.
[01:16:57.760 --> 01:16:58.680]   And your first two are free.
[01:16:58.680 --> 01:16:59.840]   You can cancel them anytime, so there
[01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:01.640]   doesn't have to be any cost or obligation to you.
[01:17:01.640 --> 01:17:05.160]   It's a good way to get an idea of what audible is like.
[01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:10.200]   Pick two exciting, interesting, entertaining books
[01:17:10.200 --> 01:17:12.920]   and get enthralled, get involved.
[01:17:12.920 --> 01:17:19.280]   audible.com/twit2.
[01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:22.640]   A whole world of listening awaits you at audible.
[01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:24.240]   It plays on all the devices.
[01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:26.160]   They're working on the Android, but right now, of course,
[01:17:26.160 --> 01:17:30.000]   on the iPhone, on the iPad, the Zoom, the Kindle, many GPS
[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.440]   devices, the Sansa's.
[01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:36.880]   audible.com/twit2.
[01:17:36.880 --> 01:17:38.160]   I can't recommend it more highly.
[01:17:38.160 --> 01:17:39.000]   It's just wonderful.
[01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:42.760]   By the way, we do this podcast with Rod Savage
[01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:44.800]   who's rowing across the Pacific right now.
[01:17:44.800 --> 01:17:47.400]   She's a featured listener at audible.com.
[01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:50.080]   She's actually put together a list of her favorite books
[01:17:50.080 --> 01:17:50.880]   as she rose.
[01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:51.960]   She listens.
[01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:53.280]   She rose like 16 hours a day.
[01:17:53.280 --> 01:17:55.600]   So she goes through a book a day.
[01:17:55.600 --> 01:17:58.040]   A book a day.
[01:17:58.040 --> 01:18:00.560]   Many of those books are books I gave her, thousands of books
[01:18:00.560 --> 01:18:02.080]   she's gone through.
[01:18:02.080 --> 01:18:04.800]   And so this is a Rosas list.
[01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:06.400]   It's all at audible.com.
[01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:11.280]   Pick two of these and call me in the morning.
[01:18:11.280 --> 01:18:12.720]   All right, we're talking Twit right now.
[01:18:12.720 --> 01:18:17.080]   Mark Millian is here from the Los Angeles Times, latimes.com.
[01:18:17.080 --> 01:18:18.800]   Mark, do you have a personal blog or somewhere you want
[01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:20.840]   to point people to to?
[01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:26.360]   Yeah, you could get my Twitter and Google Buzz stuff
[01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:28.840]   at hayniceblog.com.
[01:18:28.840 --> 01:18:30.800]   Hey, that's a good name.
[01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:31.640]   It's a little generic.
[01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:32.160]   Hey, it is.
[01:18:32.160 --> 01:18:33.160]   Hey, nice blog.
[01:18:33.160 --> 01:18:37.520]   You know, Dane, our executive producer here at Twit
[01:18:37.520 --> 01:18:39.640]   has hay.com.
[01:18:39.640 --> 01:18:40.320]   You guys should get--
[01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:41.120]   Excellent oh man.
[01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:41.920]   Isn't that a good name?
[01:18:41.920 --> 01:18:43.960]   Yeah.
[01:18:43.960 --> 01:18:45.880]   Oh, you got a forbidden--
[01:18:45.880 --> 01:18:46.880]   It's down.
[01:18:46.880 --> 01:18:48.120]   It's down right now.
[01:18:48.120 --> 01:18:48.880]   He's working on it.
[01:18:48.880 --> 01:18:52.200]   And hayniceblog is up the iPad cafe.
[01:18:52.200 --> 01:18:53.040]   I love it.
[01:18:53.040 --> 01:18:53.840]   And of course, the yellow--
[01:18:53.840 --> 01:18:56.240]   You're about switching from posters to tumbler.
[01:18:56.240 --> 01:18:57.040]   Haven't decided.
[01:18:57.040 --> 01:18:58.360]   Oh, no, stay-- I like posters.
[01:18:58.360 --> 01:19:01.320]   But you know, posters doesn't have any design style, right?
[01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:02.440]   But what you do with posters--
[01:19:02.440 --> 01:19:03.800]   I wouldn't use it as a blog.
[01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:06.200]   I would use it as a platform so that it gets your stuff
[01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:10.560]   to your blog so you can create a tumb blog on tumbler
[01:19:10.560 --> 01:19:13.400]   that posters feeds to.
[01:19:13.400 --> 01:19:14.400]   Best of both worlds, right?
[01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:15.880]   I should probably set that up.
[01:19:15.880 --> 01:19:18.800]   Because I use posters like when I was traveling--
[01:19:18.800 --> 01:19:20.120]   not that we're doing an ad for it.
[01:19:20.120 --> 01:19:22.440]   But when I was traveling in China,
[01:19:22.440 --> 01:19:25.040]   I would just post stuff via email to posters.
[01:19:25.040 --> 01:19:27.160]   And then it would go out to my other blogs.
[01:19:27.160 --> 01:19:28.040]   Tumbler's pretty good too.
[01:19:28.040 --> 01:19:29.880]   They're both good.
[01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:33.000]   Also with this Ryan Block, GDGT-- that's the place to go.
[01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:34.240]   Ryan's a great website.
[01:19:34.240 --> 01:19:36.640]   He does this with Peter Rojas.
[01:19:36.640 --> 01:19:40.000]   And now you've got news there as well as a list
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:41.880]   of your favorite gadgets.
[01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:43.800]   How's the iPad going?
[01:19:43.800 --> 01:19:47.880]   What is the hot I have gadget right now on GDGT?
[01:19:47.880 --> 01:19:50.640]   iPad is not the hot I have gadget.
[01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:51.640]   It's a hot I want.
[01:19:51.640 --> 01:19:53.200]   Not as many people are body up.
[01:19:53.200 --> 01:19:55.120]   But I think it's the most wanted gadget.
[01:19:55.120 --> 01:19:58.240]   At least one of the most wanted gadgets.
[01:19:58.240 --> 01:20:00.160]   Actually, I think the most owned gadget
[01:20:00.160 --> 01:20:02.200]   is either the 3G or the 3GS.
[01:20:02.200 --> 01:20:06.960]   I think we have like 20,000 people who have one on the site.
[01:20:06.960 --> 01:20:11.240]   So you go to GDGT.com and you enter in all the stuff you have.
[01:20:11.240 --> 01:20:13.520]   And that's a great way to find out about it and get news
[01:20:13.520 --> 01:20:14.160]   and stuff.
[01:20:14.160 --> 01:20:17.680]   And you can put in the stuff you want, which is kind of cool.
[01:20:17.680 --> 01:20:20.040]   And have conversations with people about it.
[01:20:20.040 --> 01:20:22.880]   And every time I go back here, of course, more gadgets in here.
[01:20:22.880 --> 01:20:27.080]   It's really become the definitive encyclopedia of gadgetry.
[01:20:27.080 --> 01:20:28.640]   We've got a lot of products in the site now.
[01:20:28.640 --> 01:20:30.120]   Pretty amazing.
[01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:30.640]   Yeah.
[01:20:30.640 --> 01:20:31.880]   A great place to learn about stuff.
[01:20:31.880 --> 01:20:34.560]   This is my stream.
[01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:37.920]   Also here, Mr. Dwight Silverman from the Houston Chronicle
[01:20:37.920 --> 01:20:40.640]   blogs.cron.com/techblog.
[01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:42.720]   And that link role that you do, the link posts
[01:20:42.720 --> 01:20:44.800]   that you do every day, are really a great way
[01:20:44.800 --> 01:20:46.680]   to keep up on what's going on in tech news.
[01:20:46.680 --> 01:20:48.400]   I read it religiously.
[01:20:48.400 --> 01:20:49.120]   Well, thank you.
[01:20:49.120 --> 01:20:50.520]   I have a great time doing it.
[01:20:50.520 --> 01:20:54.600]   And Ryan, I want to say, I thought gadget was one of the best
[01:20:54.600 --> 01:20:57.800]   ideas for a website in a long time.
[01:20:57.800 --> 01:20:58.320]   I love it.
[01:20:58.320 --> 01:20:59.920]   Yeah, you can appreciate your saying that.
[01:20:59.920 --> 01:21:01.160]   Is it a clever?
[01:21:01.160 --> 01:21:01.840]   It's brilliant.
[01:21:01.840 --> 01:21:02.520]   It really is.
[01:21:02.520 --> 01:21:03.880]   Yeah.
[01:21:03.880 --> 01:21:04.880]   So we got some good people.
[01:21:04.880 --> 01:21:06.160]   I appreciate that.
[01:21:06.160 --> 01:21:08.160]   It's a little self-congratulatory in here right now,
[01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:10.680]   but that's over.
[01:21:10.680 --> 01:21:11.760]   That's all right.
[01:21:11.760 --> 01:21:14.520]   I could take it.
[01:21:14.520 --> 01:21:15.680]   We're almost done here.
[01:21:15.680 --> 01:21:17.280]   What are some of the other hot stories?
[01:21:17.280 --> 01:21:21.680]   Have we missed anything you guys want to talk about?
[01:21:21.680 --> 01:21:25.200]   I actually talked to Ryan last week for a story I was working on.
[01:21:25.200 --> 01:21:28.240]   Oh, that's right.
[01:21:28.240 --> 01:21:32.080]   The unveiling of Boy Genius behind the Boy Genius
[01:21:32.080 --> 01:21:37.400]   report who just recently sold his blog, his mobile rumors
[01:21:37.400 --> 01:21:42.080]   and news blog for in a multi-million dollar deal.
[01:21:42.080 --> 01:21:43.160]   So--
[01:21:43.160 --> 01:21:48.480]   One blog, one blog, TbG, for more than a million dollars.
[01:21:48.480 --> 01:21:49.880]   That's amazing.
[01:21:49.880 --> 01:21:53.440]   And you know what really bumps me out is I named it,
[01:21:53.440 --> 01:21:56.640]   and I didn't see a penny.
[01:21:56.640 --> 01:21:58.200]   You knew this guy.
[01:21:58.200 --> 01:22:00.680]   Did you know he was the Boy Genius?
[01:22:00.680 --> 01:22:01.040]   Well, yeah.
[01:22:01.040 --> 01:22:02.120]   I mean, he used to write for me.
[01:22:02.120 --> 01:22:02.760]   Of course you knew.
[01:22:02.760 --> 01:22:03.760]   Of course you knew.
[01:22:03.760 --> 01:22:04.280]   Yeah.
[01:22:04.280 --> 01:22:07.280]   And I mean, the Boy Genius report, the name of his site,
[01:22:07.280 --> 01:22:10.160]   is the name that I came up with for his call.
[01:22:10.160 --> 01:22:13.680]   And when he told me that he wanted to do his own site,
[01:22:13.680 --> 01:22:16.280]   I kind of gave him my blessing to take the name
[01:22:16.280 --> 01:22:17.800]   and run with it.
[01:22:17.800 --> 01:22:20.360]   And man, I should have gotten a writing or something.
[01:22:20.360 --> 01:22:22.560]   I could have really used a couple of lots on the thing.
[01:22:22.560 --> 01:22:23.680]   It's a great name.
[01:22:23.680 --> 01:22:26.360]   His real name actually appeared on Engadget
[01:22:26.360 --> 01:22:29.280]   in association with that in a couple of posts, right?
[01:22:29.280 --> 01:22:30.120]   He was actually--
[01:22:30.120 --> 01:22:30.880]   He should have known.
[01:22:30.880 --> 01:22:32.440]   It was obvious who he was.
[01:22:32.440 --> 01:22:34.200]   It was kind of an open secret.
[01:22:34.200 --> 01:22:36.760]   My favorite thing was for years, people would come up to me
[01:22:36.760 --> 01:22:38.200]   and ask me if I was Boy Genius.
[01:22:38.200 --> 01:22:40.200]   And it never really made any sense to me,
[01:22:40.200 --> 01:22:42.120]   because why would I need to write under a pseudo name?
[01:22:42.120 --> 01:22:45.160]   I was breaking all kinds of stories myself.
[01:22:45.160 --> 01:22:49.120]   But yeah, I mean, John has done a really good job.
[01:22:49.120 --> 01:22:51.400]   I think even though it was kind of an open secret
[01:22:51.400 --> 01:22:56.000]   among people who knew him at keeping it from getting out.
[01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.640]   He looks like Lee Harvey Oswald in the picture on the Times.
[01:22:58.640 --> 01:22:59.640]   But--
[01:22:59.640 --> 01:23:02.000]   I thought he looked like Seth MacFarlane.
[01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:03.320]   Oh, he does a little bit.
[01:23:03.320 --> 01:23:04.880]   The creator of Family Guy.
[01:23:04.880 --> 01:23:06.120]   He does look like Seth MacFarlane.
[01:23:06.120 --> 01:23:08.560]   He's 23.
[01:23:08.560 --> 01:23:12.760]   So he was a teenager when he started working for you.
[01:23:12.760 --> 01:23:15.120]   As maybe 16 when he went to Engadget.
[01:23:15.120 --> 01:23:16.200]   Believable.
[01:23:16.200 --> 01:23:17.000]   Good for you.
[01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:20.400]   Jonathan Geller, now a millionaire.
[01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:24.800]   And they're going to rename the Boy Genius report to tbg.com,
[01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:25.960]   right?
[01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:26.480]   BGR.
[01:23:26.480 --> 01:23:27.000]   BGR.
[01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:27.480]   BGR.
[01:23:27.480 --> 01:23:28.000]   Oh, BGR.
[01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:28.480]   What am I saying?
[01:23:28.480 --> 01:23:29.080]   Tbg.
[01:23:29.080 --> 01:23:31.040]   That's something else.
[01:23:31.040 --> 01:23:32.920]   I just made that up.
[01:23:32.920 --> 01:23:33.920]   Bg.
[01:23:33.920 --> 01:23:36.080]   This doesn't happen very often anymore.
[01:23:36.080 --> 01:23:37.600]   It used to happen fairly frequently.
[01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:42.600]   But the last one I can remember that's like this was JK on the run,
[01:23:42.600 --> 01:23:47.760]   James Kendrick's blog, Getting Acquired by GigaOM.
[01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:51.440]   But this is kind of relatively rare now.
[01:23:51.440 --> 01:23:56.200]   Ooh, they got a little bit of a scoop on BGR.com right now.
[01:23:56.200 --> 01:23:59.240]   Adobe to distribute Android handsets to its employees?
[01:23:59.240 --> 01:24:01.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:24:01.720 --> 01:24:06.160]   That would be kind of a-- this is more of that CEO in fighting.
[01:24:06.160 --> 01:24:07.240]   OK.
[01:24:07.240 --> 01:24:08.120]   OK.
[01:24:08.120 --> 01:24:13.440]   In that case, we're going to give the Nexus one to our employees.
[01:24:13.440 --> 01:24:15.960]   Wow.
[01:24:15.960 --> 01:24:17.000]   Great blog.
[01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:20.120]   Congratulations, Jonathan, on a job well done.
[01:24:20.120 --> 01:24:22.680]   Send Ryan a buck or two.
[01:24:22.680 --> 01:24:24.320]   Yeah, I could use a couple bucks.
[01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:25.160]   It deserves a little--
[01:24:25.160 --> 01:24:27.680]   I'm living the startup life now.
[01:24:27.680 --> 01:24:30.040]   There's a little money.
[01:24:30.040 --> 01:24:31.920]   I don't have that Leo Laport money.
[01:24:31.920 --> 01:24:33.120]   Oh, yeah, that money.
[01:24:33.120 --> 01:24:34.760]   Where is that money?
[01:24:34.760 --> 01:24:35.520]   My desk?
[01:24:35.520 --> 01:24:36.320]   Where is that money?
[01:24:36.320 --> 01:24:37.640]   I need that money.
[01:24:37.640 --> 01:24:40.920]   Did you see our good friends, NitroZack and Snaggy, who
[01:24:40.920 --> 01:24:45.320]   do all of our album art, they do the Joy of Tech comic
[01:24:45.320 --> 01:24:46.400]   at geekculture.com.
[01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:50.960]   They did a really fun Steve Jobs email generator.
[01:24:50.960 --> 01:24:54.400]   We were talking about the nope and yep.
[01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:56.120]   First you create the letter to Steve Jobs.
[01:24:56.120 --> 01:24:56.600]   Hi, Steve.
[01:24:56.600 --> 01:24:57.720]   I'm a longtime Apple fan.
[01:24:57.720 --> 01:24:58.760]   I'm a longtime Apple enemy.
[01:24:58.760 --> 01:25:00.440]   New to Apple, New to Hating Apple.
[01:25:00.440 --> 01:25:02.800]   There's quite a few choices.
[01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:04.560]   And so you put it all together.
[01:25:04.560 --> 01:25:05.760]   Who loves everything you do?
[01:25:05.760 --> 01:25:07.040]   Can't stop eating potato chips?
[01:25:07.040 --> 01:25:08.080]   Has a lot of time to kill.
[01:25:08.080 --> 01:25:09.160]   Would like to offer advice.
[01:25:09.160 --> 01:25:12.400]   Can see you now on my magic iPad.
[01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:13.560]   You are insanely great.
[01:25:13.560 --> 01:25:15.880]   My hero, arrogant, pompous, pretentious rotten,
[01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:19.520]   my benevolent dictator, the wind beneath my wings.
[01:25:19.520 --> 01:25:21.920]   I have a question about my iPhone, iPad, iPad, Mac book,
[01:25:21.920 --> 01:25:24.640]   Newton, one button mouse, no button mouse.
[01:25:24.640 --> 01:25:28.040]   My dad's cousin's dentist's iPod shuffle.
[01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:31.800]   Anyway, once you write the email, here's Steve's reply.
[01:25:31.800 --> 01:25:33.720]   You get some choices.
[01:25:33.720 --> 01:25:35.040]   No nope, no big deal.
[01:25:35.040 --> 01:25:36.480]   Nope, no sorry, no, no way.
[01:25:36.480 --> 01:25:37.800]   No chance in hell, no way.
[01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:40.760]   Expative, expletive, expletive, not to worry, not a yep.
[01:25:40.760 --> 01:25:41.760]   OK.
[01:25:41.760 --> 01:25:44.280]   Or if you want porn, get an Android phone.
[01:25:44.280 --> 01:25:47.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:49.720]   Which Steve actually said.
[01:25:49.720 --> 01:25:50.960]   Yeah, to me, to my question.
[01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:53.200]   It was your question.
[01:25:53.200 --> 01:25:54.680]   Was he giving you personal advice,
[01:25:54.680 --> 01:25:56.560]   or was he just kind of in general?
[01:25:56.560 --> 01:26:01.040]   No, the question I asked was, I think a lot of people
[01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:04.120]   would like to see Apple open up the platform.
[01:26:04.120 --> 01:26:08.080]   I mean, obviously, it's a very contentious issue for Apple,
[01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:10.720]   the closed nature of the App Store.
[01:26:10.720 --> 01:26:14.040]   So why not just bury a setting, five levels deep
[01:26:14.040 --> 01:26:15.920]   in the settings, like Android does,
[01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:18.200]   that allows you to run unsigned apps.
[01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:22.520]   And his response to that was, well, yeah, we could do that.
[01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:24.680]   But Android has a porn store.
[01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:28.360]   So if you want to look at porn on your phone, go get Android.
[01:26:28.360 --> 01:26:30.080]   That's a way to turn it.
[01:26:30.080 --> 01:26:33.200]   Yeah, I mean, by that point, the mic had already
[01:26:33.200 --> 01:26:34.400]   gone back to the PR person.
[01:26:34.400 --> 01:26:35.520]   And it was on to the next question.
[01:26:35.520 --> 01:26:36.040]   No follow-ups.
[01:26:36.040 --> 01:26:38.080]   And it would like to have asked about Safari.
[01:26:38.080 --> 01:26:39.600]   And maybe we should lock that down.
[01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:41.800]   So you can't view any porn.
[01:26:41.800 --> 01:26:43.080]   No follow-ups.
[01:26:43.080 --> 01:26:46.600]   What'll be interesting is when Steve Jobs appears on the stage
[01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:50.280]   at D8 with Cara Swisher and Walt Mossberg.
[01:26:50.280 --> 01:26:56.040]   And obviously, a lot of these things will still be unresolved
[01:26:56.040 --> 01:26:57.520]   by the time he gets on stage.
[01:26:57.520 --> 01:26:58.960]   I think that's in June.
[01:26:58.960 --> 01:27:05.200]   Yeah, and you know that Cara and Walt will ask tough questions.
[01:27:05.200 --> 01:27:05.720]   Maybe.
[01:27:05.720 --> 01:27:06.640]   Maybe.
[01:27:06.640 --> 01:27:07.760]   Maybe.
[01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:11.200]   But also, if it's in June and if we have an announcement
[01:27:11.200 --> 01:27:17.080]   on the next iPhone, there may be mostly a lot of drooling
[01:27:17.080 --> 01:27:17.960]   over the hardware.
[01:27:17.960 --> 01:27:22.160]   And there may not be a whole lot of hardballs thrown.
[01:27:22.160 --> 01:27:24.200]   I hope they throw some hardballs.
[01:27:24.200 --> 01:27:25.160]   It should be interesting.
[01:27:25.160 --> 01:27:26.440]   And we tried to get Cara on today.
[01:27:26.440 --> 01:27:27.440]   She was unavailable.
[01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:31.400]   We'll get her on either before or after that event.
[01:27:31.400 --> 01:27:32.280]   Or maybe both.
[01:27:32.280 --> 01:27:33.920]   And get her take.
[01:27:33.920 --> 01:27:36.800]   Maybe we can feed her some questions to ask Steve.
[01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:38.280]   One last story before we go.
[01:27:38.280 --> 01:27:39.520]   Just a little word of warning.
[01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:41.000]   May 5th, the internet might fail.
[01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:42.360]   Just thought you'd like to know.
[01:27:42.360 --> 01:27:44.120]   Keep your eye peeled.
[01:27:44.120 --> 01:27:46.440]   And perhaps save up some sites in your browser
[01:27:46.440 --> 01:27:50.840]   just so you don't have to go porn free on May 5th.
[01:27:50.840 --> 01:27:53.640]   I can.
[01:27:53.640 --> 01:27:56.640]   Will complete the first phase of the rollout of DNS sec,
[01:27:56.640 --> 01:28:00.360]   which is the security extensions for the broken DNS system.
[01:28:00.360 --> 01:28:02.680]   This is actually very important.
[01:28:02.680 --> 01:28:07.440]   They've been delaying it because there is some risk
[01:28:07.440 --> 01:28:09.560]   that it would cause your browser to fail.
[01:28:12.640 --> 01:28:17.720]   According to some security experts,
[01:28:17.720 --> 01:28:21.880]   older networking equipment might see these larger requests
[01:28:21.880 --> 01:28:25.280]   as a problem block them under the assumption they
[01:28:25.280 --> 01:28:28.520]   represent an anomaly and take you off the internet.
[01:28:28.520 --> 01:28:29.920]   Just a word of warning may 5th.
[01:28:29.920 --> 01:28:33.080]   The internet goes down.
[01:28:33.080 --> 01:28:34.800]   It's going to be OK.
[01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:37.840]   It'll come back one of these days.
[01:28:37.840 --> 01:28:39.880]   The big ones will be all right.
[01:28:39.880 --> 01:28:42.200]   Right.
[01:28:42.200 --> 01:28:44.800]   Ryan Block is at GDGTGagit.com.
[01:28:44.800 --> 01:28:45.800]   Thank you for being here, Ryan.
[01:28:45.800 --> 01:28:47.040]   We really appreciate it.
[01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:47.640]   Thanks for having me.
[01:28:47.640 --> 01:28:49.160]   Always a pleasure to have you.
[01:28:49.160 --> 01:28:50.000]   Mr. Martin Millian.
[01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:50.680]   Oh, what?
[01:28:50.680 --> 01:28:51.280]   Something to plug?
[01:28:51.280 --> 01:28:51.760]   I'm sorry.
[01:28:51.760 --> 01:28:54.440]   Before we go, though, Chicago people,
[01:28:54.440 --> 01:28:56.280]   I'd really like to invite you to our event.
[01:28:56.280 --> 01:28:58.800]   We're coming to Chicago May 12th.
[01:28:58.800 --> 01:29:01.520]   Where and where and how can I find out more?
[01:29:01.520 --> 01:29:02.120]   It's on the site.
[01:29:02.120 --> 01:29:03.200]   It's on GDGT.com.
[01:29:03.200 --> 01:29:06.000]   It's actually it's on features.gdgt.
[01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:07.520]   Are you doing a party?
[01:29:07.520 --> 01:29:08.520]   Yeah, we're doing an event.
[01:29:08.520 --> 01:29:11.960]   So the kind of event that we did out in San Francisco,
[01:29:11.960 --> 01:29:13.800]   we did win it set by Southwest.
[01:29:13.800 --> 01:29:14.240]   That was fun.
[01:29:14.240 --> 01:29:14.760]   That was fun.
[01:29:14.760 --> 01:29:15.400]   Chicago.
[01:29:15.400 --> 01:29:17.400]   Yeah.
[01:29:17.400 --> 01:29:18.520]   Sorry, I'm just really excited about.
[01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:19.880]   I wanted to make sure people knew.
[01:29:19.880 --> 01:29:22.480]   Because Chicago doesn't see a lot of these kinds of gajity
[01:29:22.480 --> 01:29:23.400]   events come through.
[01:29:23.400 --> 01:29:24.560]   Gallery 233.
[01:29:24.560 --> 01:29:28.080]   That's 233 West Huron, 7 PM.
[01:29:28.080 --> 01:29:29.760]   A good place to see lots of gadgets.
[01:29:29.760 --> 01:29:32.080]   I'm sure they'll be an incredible there.
[01:29:32.080 --> 01:29:33.800]   Maybe other some other new stuff.
[01:29:33.800 --> 01:29:34.320]   Who knows?
[01:29:34.320 --> 01:29:36.240]   Yeah, you will definitely see the incredible there.
[01:29:36.240 --> 01:29:38.560]   And Windows Phone 7 and a lot of other cool stuff.
[01:29:38.560 --> 01:29:40.600]   Yeah, the ken is coming out the day before.
[01:29:40.600 --> 01:29:42.320]   Did they need to cut you off the way?
[01:29:42.320 --> 01:29:44.920]   The kin is coming out May 6th that Microsoft's announced.
[01:29:44.920 --> 01:29:47.600]   So you'll have some kens there, I'm sure, too.
[01:29:47.600 --> 01:29:48.960]   Very fun.
[01:29:48.960 --> 01:29:53.840]   GDGT Live in Chicago May 12th.
[01:29:53.840 --> 01:29:56.920]   Mark Millian, when's your party?
[01:29:56.920 --> 01:29:59.600]   I am not throwing a party, but if anyone in LA
[01:29:59.600 --> 01:30:03.520]   wants to get a beer, send me a name.
[01:30:03.520 --> 01:30:05.960]   But I can vouch for Ryan's parties
[01:30:05.960 --> 01:30:07.080]   and I went to want it CES.
[01:30:07.080 --> 01:30:08.200]   And it was awesome.
[01:30:08.200 --> 01:30:09.000]   Awesome.
[01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:10.680]   Awesome.
[01:30:10.680 --> 01:30:13.320]   The one that we did this year with Lenovo.
[01:30:13.320 --> 01:30:14.320]   Yeah.
[01:30:14.320 --> 01:30:15.200]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:30:15.200 --> 01:30:16.480]   Actually, I think.
[01:30:16.480 --> 01:30:18.720]   Yeah, that was a little bit unusual for us,
[01:30:18.720 --> 01:30:20.440]   because I've never really done a party CES before.
[01:30:20.440 --> 01:30:21.960]   That was pretty fun.
[01:30:21.960 --> 01:30:23.440]   Yeah, that was cool.
[01:30:23.440 --> 01:30:25.440]   We want to do-- we're trying to do--
[01:30:25.440 --> 01:30:26.520]   I'm waiting to hear from Ford.
[01:30:26.520 --> 01:30:29.520]   I want to do-- there's a Maker Fair coming to Detroit in July.
[01:30:29.520 --> 01:30:31.480]   And just like you, I think we should do more stuff
[01:30:31.480 --> 01:30:32.520]   kind of in the middle of the country
[01:30:32.520 --> 01:30:34.400]   instead of the left or the right coasts.
[01:30:34.400 --> 01:30:36.760]   So we want to do an event in Detroit in July.
[01:30:36.760 --> 01:30:37.880]   So stay tuned for that.
[01:30:37.880 --> 01:30:41.720]   If we can, we're going to tie in with Maker Fair out there.
[01:30:41.720 --> 01:30:46.240]   Mr. Continental Airlines merges with United Airlines.
[01:30:46.240 --> 01:30:51.360]   So now Dwight Silverman lives in the biggest hub of all.
[01:30:51.360 --> 01:30:52.680]   I'm just OK.
[01:30:52.680 --> 01:30:53.080]   Great.
[01:30:53.080 --> 01:30:54.960]   So Houston's the place to live, right?
[01:30:54.960 --> 01:30:56.120]   Houston's the place to live.
[01:30:56.120 --> 01:30:59.680]   And Ryan, you need to do one of these parties here in Houston.
[01:30:59.680 --> 01:31:03.480]   Come in August when it's really nice and cool.
[01:31:03.480 --> 01:31:04.920]   I don't know about Houston.
[01:31:04.920 --> 01:31:07.360]   We did one in Austin though for South By.
[01:31:07.360 --> 01:31:08.000]   That was fun.
[01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:09.080]   That one was a lot of fun.
[01:31:09.080 --> 01:31:11.440]   No, but so you go to Houston, you get the wonderful oil
[01:31:11.440 --> 01:31:13.360]   washing up on the shore.
[01:31:13.360 --> 01:31:15.160]   No, that's in Louisiana.
[01:31:15.160 --> 01:31:16.080]   But aren't you on the Gulf?
[01:31:16.080 --> 01:31:17.800]   I mean, couldn't it come your way too?
[01:31:17.800 --> 01:31:20.480]   The way the placement of the well
[01:31:20.480 --> 01:31:23.120]   and the way the current is flowing,
[01:31:23.120 --> 01:31:25.560]   for now is keeping it away from us.
[01:31:25.560 --> 01:31:28.600]   They've closed fishing from Louisiana east.
[01:31:28.600 --> 01:31:30.400]   But so far, we've been OK here.
[01:31:30.400 --> 01:31:31.480]   Oh, thank goodness.
[01:31:31.480 --> 01:31:32.560]   That's a mess.
[01:31:32.560 --> 01:31:34.120]   But seriously, Ryan, consider it.
[01:31:34.120 --> 01:31:36.880]   I know Leo won't come to Houston, but I know you will.
[01:31:36.880 --> 01:31:38.920]   It's too hot.
[01:31:38.920 --> 01:31:39.920]   Maybe next year.
[01:31:39.920 --> 01:31:43.480]   I think we've got our venues scoped out for this year.
[01:31:43.480 --> 01:31:46.440]   But 2011, I'm going to make sure that our guy who's
[01:31:46.440 --> 01:31:47.240]   doing our events knows about--
[01:31:47.240 --> 01:31:49.000]   2011.
[01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:50.760]   Aren't there some big tech companies in Houston
[01:31:50.760 --> 01:31:52.200]   that might sponsor Ryan's visit?
[01:31:52.200 --> 01:31:56.320]   No.
[01:31:56.320 --> 01:31:58.480]   Is NASA-- is that--
[01:31:58.480 --> 01:32:00.360]   isn't the space center there, NASA?
[01:32:00.360 --> 01:32:01.080]   Yeah, sure.
[01:32:01.080 --> 01:32:03.200]   Sure, NASA will sponsor you, Ryan.
[01:32:03.200 --> 01:32:03.700]   Bring it.
[01:32:03.700 --> 01:32:05.000]   They got money to burn.
[01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:06.160]   Yeah, they got money to burn.
[01:32:06.160 --> 01:32:07.160]   They're on that.
[01:32:07.160 --> 01:32:09.040]   Those guys have endless amounts of cash.
[01:32:09.040 --> 01:32:09.560]   That's right.
[01:32:09.560 --> 01:32:10.000]   Yeah, we--
[01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:11.440]   Not flying space shuttles anymore.
[01:32:11.440 --> 01:32:14.200]   We have friends in Houston because of the space center
[01:32:14.200 --> 01:32:14.720]   down there.
[01:32:14.720 --> 01:32:16.600]   I think maybe we should go down there.
[01:32:16.600 --> 01:32:18.600]   Would you accept Twitch?
[01:32:18.600 --> 01:32:19.320]   Bring it.
[01:32:19.320 --> 01:32:20.880]   Bring it, he says.
[01:32:20.880 --> 01:32:22.600]   Bring it.
[01:32:22.600 --> 01:32:24.800]   Blogs.cron.com/techblog.
[01:32:24.800 --> 01:32:26.480]   Thank you very much all for being here.
[01:32:26.480 --> 01:32:29.160]   Don't forget you can watch us do this show every Sunday
[01:32:29.160 --> 01:32:31.620]   afternoon, 6 p.m. Eastern, 3 p.m. Pacific,
[01:32:31.620 --> 01:32:33.800]   at live.twit.tv.
[01:32:33.800 --> 01:32:37.960]   If you are outside of the US, that's I think 2,200 UTC.
[01:32:37.960 --> 01:32:39.960]   And of course, you'll then see it on YouTube
[01:32:39.960 --> 01:32:42.000]   on the Twitch channel there, youtube.com/twit,
[01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:45.360]   or on iTunes or anywhere that better podcasts are carried.
[01:32:45.360 --> 01:32:46.400]   We thank you for being here.
[01:32:46.400 --> 01:32:48.720]   And we'll see you next week, another Twitch.
[01:32:48.720 --> 01:32:50.720]   Who's in the can?
[01:32:50.720 --> 01:32:52.040]   Do it on the Twitch.
[01:32:52.040 --> 01:32:53.040]   All right.
[01:32:53.040 --> 01:32:54.880]   Do it on the Twitch, baby.
[01:32:54.880 --> 01:32:55.720]   Do it on the Twitch.
[01:32:55.720 --> 01:32:56.720]   All right.
[01:32:56.720 --> 01:32:58.600]   Do it on the Twitch, baby.
[01:32:58.600 --> 01:32:59.600]   Do it on the Twitch.
[01:32:59.600 --> 01:33:00.600]   All right.
[01:33:00.600 --> 01:33:02.360]   Do it on the Twitch, baby.
