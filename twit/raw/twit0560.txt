[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   She of the bow.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   Yes.

[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Confection.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   Thank you.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   How many bows do you have?
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   I am unsure, but I believe I have six of them in my purse right now.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   What? In case you thought maybe you want to make sure you matched my bow.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   Yeah, you got to have options when you're going somewhere and you never know if you're going to switch platoon events.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   You got to have your option to need to switch them.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   Host of the "Nothing Matters" cast at nomatterscast.twit.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   Twitter, no matter. Never mind.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   You're the host of it.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   We're on SoundCloud.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   On SoundCloud.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   Good place to be.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   I think so.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   Also with us to Vindra Hardewar from Engagic.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   Great to see you again to Vindra.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   Welcome.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   It's good to be here.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Yep.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   I feel like I'm stealing the entire TNT lineup here because also joining us.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   His first time with us in this show and it's about time.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   He's a regular on Tech News today.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   Sam Mashkovich.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   Mashkovich.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   Oh, hello.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   Sam, am I saying I'm right?
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   Mashkovich?
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   Close.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   No, Mashkovich.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   But I wanted you to try about eight more times because then everyone would go, "I remember
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   that name."
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   Right.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   That's really all I'm ever going to do.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   Mashkovich.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Mashkovich.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.760]   It's appropriate to have you on May Day though because were you at the big event on the Red
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:34.760]   Square today?
[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:35.760]   The Red Square.
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.000]   Carbon Chov and Cruchev and no?
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   No, I think it's Seattle, Washington.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   They don't do that.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   They don't do that.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   They're doing recreational products.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   Anyway, Sam, it's great to have you.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   Welcome.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   I'm really happy to be here.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   Hey, how's it going?
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   Boy, I don't know where to start.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:01.880]   We actually wanted to get Alex Wilhelm, your evil twin, on for the show because he covers
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.320]   the finance sector and he was just too busy covering the finance sector.
[00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:09.360]   This was a big week for quarterly numbers.
[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.560]   And I don't think we need to belabor them, but maybe we can just touch the highlights.
[00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.160]   Apple sucks.
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.040]   Twitter is just dead in the water.
[00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.440]   Microsoft, forget about it.
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.440]   Pretty much says it all.
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.400]   No, there's more to it than that.
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.400]   Facebook's blowing up.
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.560]   Facebook and Facebook is the king of the world.
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.040]   The king, their numbers were incredible.
[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.040]   They were what?
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.080]   200% for whatever income actually matters.
[00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.080]   Unbelievable.
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.080]   They're non-Gap.
[00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:50.520]   Why everybody now does-- so GAP stands for generally accepted accounting practices, GWAP.
[00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.320]   In other words, like real accounting.
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.600]   And then everybody does non-GAP numbers, which are phony accounting.
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.600]   And why?
[00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:59.600]   They look better.
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:05.080]   They look better because we're leaving out things like stock options and executive compensation.
[00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.640]   But that's part of your business.
[00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.400]   I don't understand why they're even allowed to do non-GAP.
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:11.400]   But OK.
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.440]   Oh, I didn't see this.
[00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.840]   Apparently you're wearing your kitty cat whiskers today.
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.880]   Are you wearing your invisible kitty cat whiskers?
[00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:19.880]   Is that--?
[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:20.880]   Yes.
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:21.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:22.880]   Yes.
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:23.880]   That's Michael.
[00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:24.880]   Michael did that.
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:25.880]   Michael O'Donnell in the back.
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:26.880]   The guy with the red suspenders.
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:27.880]   There he is.
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:28.880]   Stay away from him.
[00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:29.880]   All right.
[00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.520]   Are we all going to get Snapchat faced by the end of the show?
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:32.520]   Apparently.
[00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:33.520]   So I have to--
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:34.520]   Actually, that was the big story of the week.
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:35.520]   Snapchat faced everywhere.
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:36.720]   You can't get away from it.
[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:41.200]   Well, it's amazing, too, because I think the big thing about Snapchat and Snapchat filters
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:45.200]   is that that new-- now that you cannot only swap your face with somebody next to you,
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:49.920]   but you can actually put somebody's face on your face, which has been used now to incredible
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:53.120]   effect by the Hillary Clinton campaign of all places.
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.120]   What?
[00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.720]   They're using-- now they did an anti-Trump Snapchat, right?
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:58.720]   Mm-hmm.
[00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:02.640]   And they utilized this new filter on Snapchat that allows you to actually put anybody's
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:03.880]   face on your face.
[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:06.560]   So they put like George Bush's face on Trump's face.
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:07.560]   Wow.
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:08.560]   And Ronald Reagan's face on Trump's face.
[00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:09.560]   That's very savvy.
[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:10.560]   Yeah.
[00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:13.680]   Full of like packed in between like burns about policy.
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:17.880]   And I was like, wow, they hired at least someone who's 22 years old.
[00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:18.880]   Yeah.
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:22.160]   Well, Obama played it safe last night at the White House Corresponds Center.
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:29.480]   He had a gag when he grabbed Michelle Obama's phone, made a plea about everyone joining healthcare.gov,
[00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:33.360]   and forgot to turn off the auto face filter, the joke being that a Satan face and a Satan
[00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.360]   voice filter came on.
[00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:35.560]   No, did it really?
[00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:36.560]   Yes.
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.680]   It was a great White House Corresponds Center.
[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:39.680]   He was pretty savvy.
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:42.360]   I did not watch it yet.
[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.080]   But you know, this is his last one.
[00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:45.080]   So he's a little loose, right?
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.080]   A little relaxed.
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:47.080]   Oh, yeah.
[00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:48.080]   He let it all out.
[00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.080]   It was really intense, yeah.
[00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:51.080]   Yeah.
[00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:52.920]   Gosh, there's so much to talk about.
[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:55.000]   So is this Hillary's Snapchat?
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.800]   Her official Snapchat.
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:57.800]   Yes.
[00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.120]   She was putting Bush's face on Trump's face.
[00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:01.120]   Wow.
[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.120]   Yeah.
[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:03.120]   That's interesting.
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:07.600]   There's been so much power or some very young staff member.
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:08.600]   Yeah.
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:09.600]   You got to reach the new voters.
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:10.600]   Do you think so?
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.240]   But if you're a millennial, this sways you.
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:14.560]   This is like, oh, wow, Hillary's so hip.
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.000]   This seems like trying too hard.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.280]   I don't know.
[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:19.920]   The whole thing about the Snapchat faces is hilarious too, because I don't know if you
[00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:22.720]   guys have seen the new season of Silicon Valley.
[00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:26.520]   But in the first episode, there was a joke that one of these companies is spending so
[00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:30.080]   much resources, so many resources to put big massaches on people.
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:31.080]   That's real.
[00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:32.440]   That's what's happening right now.
[00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:34.320]   That's like their most innovative new project.
[00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:35.920]   It's excellent timing, right?
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:36.920]   Yeah.
[00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:40.880]   And Davenger, just in case you're wondering, I have absolutely hired that team to work
[00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:41.880]   on this.
[00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:42.880]   This is 1.0.
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:43.880]   That's why it's a little fuzzy.
[00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:45.320]   We're totally working out the tech.
[00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:46.680]   It's going to be really interesting.
[00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:47.680]   I'm really interested in the IPO.
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:51.400]   I'm going to have some interesting non-gap numbers to reveal pretty soon.
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:52.400]   Very excited.
[00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:56.600]   And then he turns to talking his phone against Drusier.
[00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:58.600]   Don't turn too fast.
[00:07:58.600 --> 00:07:59.600]   Yeah.
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:01.960]   Oh, wow.
[00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:05.480]   Because Donald Trump gets closer to winning the GOP nomination.
[00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:06.480]   He's realizing something.
[00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:10.320]   This is in case you're not following Hillary's Snapchat, which I am.
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:13.800]   But the problem is I don't like the kids today.
[00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:15.320]   Don't do it often enough.
[00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:17.440]   Are you not seeing my laptop?
[00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:20.040]   Is that-- there we go.
[00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:22.960]   He's realizing something.
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:26.960]   And then a hat that says make Trump presidential.
[00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:27.960]   Wow.
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:34.640]   This is-- if they show this on a television ad, I think people would be actually upset
[00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:35.640]   a little bit, right?
[00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:36.640]   But you can get away with it on Snapchat.
[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:37.640]   Yeah.
[00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:40.520]   Well, I think that that's really the point, is that they're trying to be cutting edge
[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:41.880]   and hip with the kids.
[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:47.400]   Again, the voting segment, the 18 to 22 voting segment, that's really just starting might
[00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:52.040]   be their first election, or they might not have voted in the midterms, or what have you.
[00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:54.600]   They identify with Snapchat because that's where they all are.
[00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:55.600]   That's where the kids are.
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:56.600]   That's where the kids are.
[00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:57.600]   That's where the kids are.
[00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:03.960]   I still think-- because old farts like me and Hillary are not there, or their parents,
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:04.960]   right?
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:09.080]   Well, it's also-- it's just such a cheap thing to throw an intern at a new technology.
[00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:10.080]   Right.
[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:13.080]   Give them some baseline rules and hope they don't write the most offensive thing ever.
[00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:17.440]   I still think my favorite promotion from this election year was when Rand Paul was still
[00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:23.000]   in the race for about 15 minutes, and he had a webcam blocker that had his name on it,
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.960]   that you could put on your laptop screen and hide your webcam at all times, making it--
[00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:33.200]   he was really writing the co-tales of the Snowness exposure stuff and letting you--
[00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:37.760]   letting you as a citizen know that follow Rand Paul all the way to your digital security
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:38.760]   future.
[00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:41.840]   I'm not sure if that would have necessarily worked out the way that he had planned, but
[00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:47.080]   I did not invest in the $10 Rand Paul Web blocker, not even for hoops and giggles.
[00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:50.040]   That could have been a collector's item, I don't know.
[00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:54.040]   If FBI director James Comey released a little piece of tape to put over your camera with
[00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:56.120]   his name on it, I would use that.
[00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:57.120]   He apparently does that.
[00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:58.120]   Yeah.
[00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:59.120]   He's that's good.
[00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:00.120]   It might be see through that when his game--
[00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:01.120]   Really?
[00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:02.880]   It's an FBI approved filter.
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:06.120]   Oh, man, I don't know where to start.
[00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:09.680]   I feel like the financial news is the least interesting news, and yet it is kind of the
[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:10.880]   big story.
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:18.420]   Apple stocked tumbled quite a bit because Apple kind of did what they said they would
[00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:21.840]   do last quarter, which is not grow very much.
[00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:26.620]   The iPhone flat, the Mac flat, iPad continues to drop.
[00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:30.580]   Actually the iPhone dropped quarter to quarter, didn't it?
[00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:38.580]   Somebody was telling me, I think-- so my mom who's in their 80s said, "Oh, yeah.
[00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:40.100]   I don't want to buy anymore Apple stuff.
[00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:41.100]   They're going out of business."
[00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:42.700]   And I said, "No, mom.
[00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:46.420]   They made $10 billion in profit in three months.
[00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:51.940]   They made almost $3 billion, more than $3 billion, almost a billion a week.
[00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:55.480]   So they're not going out of business anytime soon."
[00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:59.340]   But you'd think it if you read the headlines like, "Oh, it's the end of the world.
[00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:00.580]   Sell your Apple stock.
[00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:03.340]   They're not growing as fast, but no one could continue to grow."
[00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:06.860]   Well, I mean, it's the whole quarterly growth obsession is going to be hard for Apple when
[00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:14.220]   they haven't done something really significant to get developing nations to really care in
[00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:19.420]   markets where they're just being flooded with really good Android devices that are just
[00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:20.420]   cheap.
[00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:25.700]   You can get a flagship Android phone, really great screens, really great cameras, everything
[00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:30.020]   you might need in China and India for so much lower.
[00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:34.060]   That's going to just really-- that's going to be the thing that blocks iPhone's development
[00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:40.260]   until-- I don't know if the 5SE is going to be the thing that really kicks that into
[00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:44.180]   gear and says, "Okay, here's something affordable and flagship level from Apple.
[00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:49.820]   But between that and the lack of things that really target that everybody can afford it
[00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:55.500]   market in the way that the iPod did and the way that the iPhone originally did, the watch
[00:11:55.500 --> 00:12:00.500]   is not necessarily something that's driving that sort of, "I'm a lower end consumer and
[00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:02.260]   I'm going to get on board with Apple."
[00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.140]   But Apple never wanted that market.
[00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:05.860]   They've always wanted the high margin market.
[00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:11.020]   Well, I mean, the high margin is you get people in with the phone and you get them stuck
[00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:12.380]   in that ecosystem.
[00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:15.700]   But that's not necessarily a growth sector if you can't find other additional things.
[00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:18.780]   And right now, what is that for Apple beyond the car?
[00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:23.660]   And how long until we see something official from Apple beyond just poaching employees
[00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:26.220]   from Tesla and vice versa?
[00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:29.940]   That's the question I think that's going to be asked by these quarterly growth-obsested
[00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:30.940]   stockholders.
[00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:34.740]   So I'm really curious what the next step is to placate that kind of crowd.
[00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:38.020]   Because if they're starting to get sour, if people are making these big complaints and
[00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:42.180]   selling stock, even if that's sort of a stupid, short-sighted thing for a company that's making
[00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:45.780]   tons of money, that question is going to continue to be asked.
[00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:47.180]   Yeah, I think it's...
[00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:49.500]   I mean, the combination of the...
[00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:50.500]   The stagnant...
[00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:54.260]   Not necessarily even stagnant, just not a record quarter for Apple.
[00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:59.580]   In combination with what people perceive as not really any kind of innovation coming through
[00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:02.100]   on Apple's next product line, I agree.
[00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:05.420]   I don't necessarily think that Apple has either really thought about or has ever been
[00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:08.020]   very good at getting the lower end market.
[00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:09.620]   I mean, everybody remembers the 5C.
[00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:13.220]   They thought that that was going to sell like crazy in China and it turns out no.
[00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:16.540]   Everybody just wanted a rose gold iPhone in China because they're all about using the
[00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:18.620]   iPhone as a status symbol.
[00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:23.980]   I still think I'm pegging the fact that they are going to come out with a really, really
[00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:28.620]   great touchscreen laptop and that's going to be their next sort of innovation, as it
[00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:32.060]   were, although touchscreen laptops are already out on the market.
[00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:33.380]   It's the same kind of process.
[00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:35.460]   Apple sort of waits.
[00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:36.660]   Does it the best?
[00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:40.620]   And then all of a sudden that's the status symbol that people are looking for.
[00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:41.620]   But I don't know if there's any...
[00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:42.980]   Is that the iPad Pro though?
[00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:44.460]   That feels like the iPad Pro, right?
[00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:48.140]   Their idea of what a touchscreen laptop would be like.
[00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:49.140]   Here's...
[00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:52.500]   Well, I think the real takeaway, and I don't see a lot of coverage of this from their
[00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:57.620]   first quarter results, which they reported this week, services.
[00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:01.020]   So this is a graph of Apple's revenue from services.
[00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:06.180]   That's Apple Pay, Apple Care, Apple Music, iCloud.
[00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:12.060]   Massive jump to $6 billion in revenue, highest ever.
[00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:17.140]   In fact, they made more in services, like two-thirds of their...
[00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:21.020]   I mean, came from services, not from hardware.
[00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:24.100]   And I think what you're actually seeing, and this is going to be an interesting transition
[00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:26.060]   for Apple to make, is they're changing.
[00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:27.300]   They even said this in the last quarter.
[00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:31.500]   We're changing from a hardware company to a services company.
[00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:36.700]   And now they're traditionally not very good at services, which may be a problem.
[00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:40.980]   But is that how they're responding to this issue of having saturated the world with
[00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:41.980]   that?
[00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:44.380]   Everybody who wants Apple hardware has bought it, nobody's buying new Apple hardware.
[00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:45.380]   Well, that's all right.
[00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:47.020]   I mean, make it up in services.
[00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:49.100]   They're not necessarily trumpeting that in a big way.
[00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:53.100]   I also wonder how much of that money is, honestly, from people who forgot to cancel their Apple
[00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:54.100]   Music trial.
[00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:57.900]   That's seriously the kind of thing I had to set a reminder on my phone just to make sure
[00:14:57.900 --> 00:14:58.900]   I wouldn't get caught by it.
[00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:01.860]   Because I'm like, I don't need a seventh one of these services.
[00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:03.780]   But yeah, that is a really good question.
[00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:07.260]   That's going to keep on expanding with everything that they've put out.
[00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:11.380]   And that's going to be as people are locked into the Apple ecosystem, if they do come
[00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:17.340]   out with a touchscreen computer that doesn't have a atrocious keyboard, the current MacBook,
[00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:20.540]   that's one of my biggest issues with it, then that could be the direction we go.
[00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:23.540]   But they've got to really speak up because I know it ours technically.
[00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:25.340]   That's just, we just never talk about that.
[00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:29.740]   That's sort of just not something that people are excited to talk about about, oh, these
[00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:31.900]   little micro transaction things.
[00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:34.940]   The money's there, but that's just not a sexy thing to talk about.
[00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:36.260]   I don't know.
[00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:40.180]   It seems inevitable that it would all grow too, just because more people are getting
[00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:41.180]   iPhones and stuff.
[00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:43.940]   So yeah, maybe now you have to pay more for iCloud.
[00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:46.100]   Maybe you need that storage for your backup.
[00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:50.820]   Maybe, oh, you got a new Apple TV and you're buying more stuff and renting more stuff.
[00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:54.940]   It seems like with the proliferation of their ecosystem, people actually investing in it
[00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:55.940]   will increase.
[00:15:55.940 --> 00:15:59.620]   So I'd be interested to know what was the thing that led to that big jump though.
[00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:00.620]   Was it the new Apple TV?
[00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:01.620]   I don't know.
[00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:04.220]   I doubt very much it was an Apple TV.
[00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:05.220]   I think that sold crazy.
[00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:07.580]   I love it, but it wasn't that.
[00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:08.580]   Yeah.
[00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:13.860]   I really think that this shows that the thinking, and we do a Mac podcast and we talk about
[00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:20.460]   this like a Mac break, but I've been thinking about it since the last Mac break, that Apple
[00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:23.740]   kind of conventional wisdom, which we talked about here and we certainly talked about a
[00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:27.060]   Mac break, is that Apple needs to find the next iPhone, right?
[00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:28.220]   What is the next hardware breakthrough?
[00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:29.900]   Is it the Apple car?
[00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:32.860]   They are spending money in building a VR division.
[00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:34.980]   They've hired some very good virtual reality.
[00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:36.460]   People, is it going to be VR?
[00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:41.500]   And I think maybe Apple's thinking to itself, well, this is where we double down on our
[00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:47.180]   success in hardware by we've got, you know, we've been building lock-in and an ecosystem
[00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:48.180]   for decades.
[00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:52.300]   Now we get to double down on it and make money on the ecosystem.
[00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:58.380]   So as long as we don't need to make a cheap iPhone, as long as we have the, they sold
[00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:01.460]   50 million iPhones in a quarter.
[00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:03.420]   It's not like they don't sell iPhones.
[00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:05.340]   They don't have hundreds of millions of users.
[00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:11.060]   And if we get each of them to pay $10 a month for Apple Music, that's a pretty good business.
[00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:12.660]   That's not a business to be ignored.
[00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:19.060]   And that's almost an annuity on the continuing kind of stable success of a hardware business.
[00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:20.060]   What about that?
[00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:21.060]   What about recasting?
[00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:24.940]   And Sam is that ours Technica still thinks Apple's a hardware company.
[00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:28.660]   Maybe your guys maybe start to thinking about maybe it's not just a hardware company anymore.
[00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:33.420]   Well, we're also thinking about the fact that Samsung has truly responded.
[00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:37.620]   They are in terms of what they put out in terms of products and services.
[00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:39.380]   Their touch whiz isn't as bad.
[00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:46.940]   Their flagship phones are getting features knocked out that Apple is not responding to.
[00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:50.220]   So that's going to continue to dominate the headlines as companies like that.
[00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:55.420]   HTC has a good phone now, the 10 coming out next month.
[00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:56.420]   And we were shocked.
[00:17:56.420 --> 00:18:00.220]   It was actually a few days before the hardware landed in Ron Amadeo's hands.
[00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:01.740]   He's our main Android guy.
[00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:03.980]   He had said, don't wait for the HTC one.
[00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:07.900]   And then he called me after 20 minutes with it and said, forget that.
[00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:10.300]   Don't buy the other one.
[00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:15.020]   So just to say that the flagship competition is huge there.
[00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:19.500]   That means Apple does have to kind of look at some of its other product lines, some of
[00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:21.300]   its other.
[00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:22.980]   It has to find excitement.
[00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:25.940]   It has to bring that out.
[00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:31.300]   We know that's something that the other Steve has not really knocked out of the park in terms
[00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:32.300]   of evangelizing.
[00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:35.820]   He's not getting us excited about the fact that health kit is on all of our phones.
[00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:38.420]   He's not evangelizing in the same way.
[00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:42.660]   So it's all about the message that Apple chooses to put out ultimately.
[00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:43.660]   That's kind of how it works.
[00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:50.580]   Interesting thing happened to Android last year, which was the Qualcomm Snapdragon 810, which
[00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:53.180]   was an unfortunate chip.
[00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:57.740]   And I think the reason the S6 suffered in a lot of other phones in the US based on this
[00:18:57.740 --> 00:19:01.180]   chip, this chip was a hot chip.
[00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:07.060]   HTC and Samsung both had a down clock it in order for it to be reliable in their phones.
[00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:10.820]   And a lot of people had a bad Android experience in 2015.
[00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:12.100]   I agree with you, by the way, Sam.
[00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:13.100]   I carry an S7.
[00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:14.780]   That's my go-to phone.
[00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:16.620]   And I really like it.
[00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:21.500]   The HTC 10 will also be using this new 820, which seems to have solved all the problems
[00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:22.500]   the 810 had.
[00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:23.500]   Yeah.
[00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:24.500]   Yeah.
[00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:25.500]   It's a good, cool chip.
[00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:26.500]   It's more battery efficient.
[00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:28.500]   All of our batteries have to be pretty damn low.
[00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:29.500]   Don't get that lag either.
[00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:30.500]   I mean, there was a real lag in the 810.
[00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:32.260]   It was very disappointing.
[00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:35.940]   So that just shows you the difference to me.
[00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:39.140]   When Apple makes it, they make their own chips, they make their own hardware, they completely
[00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:40.420]   control this tightly.
[00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:43.660]   They lock you into services.
[00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:46.140]   Even Tim Cook in the earnings call said this.
[00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:52.060]   He says, "Our team executed extremely well in the face of strong macroeconomic headwinds."
[00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:57.100]   See, he's blaming exchange rates and things like that.
[00:19:57.100 --> 00:20:01.700]   We're very happy with the continued strong growth in revenue from services thanks to
[00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:06.060]   the incredible strength of the Apple ecosystem and our growing base of over 1 billion active
[00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:07.060]   devices.
[00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:16.220]   I feel like Apple's saying, "We don't have to worry about the Qualcomm or Samsung because
[00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:19.100]   we make it all and we own the ecosystem.
[00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:22.860]   And as long as we have a billion active devices and keep it at a billion active devices, we've
[00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:27.940]   got a way ahead that makes us a lot of money."
[00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:29.860]   That's a different Apple very much so.
[00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:30.860]   Yeah.
[00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:33.100]   I don't think anybody was worried about them making money.
[00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:36.060]   It's more about, "Oh my gosh, my skills are dropping."
[00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:37.060]   Yeah.
[00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:40.300]   That growth is slowing down.
[00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:44.620]   That's also just a symptom of Apple being so freaking successful for what, seven years
[00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:46.220]   now, for so long.
[00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:49.540]   It's inevitable that this would happen.
[00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:53.140]   We should probably, I don't know, talk about the ideas or what we're hearing from iPhone
[00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:55.500]   rumors at some point.
[00:20:55.500 --> 00:21:00.100]   I wouldn't be surprised if we don't even get a major refresh this year just based on everything
[00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:01.100]   we're hearing.
[00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:03.620]   It seems like more of the upgrades are set for next year.
[00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:04.620]   What does that mean for Apple?
[00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:05.620]   If you go a whole year with another--
[00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:06.620]   Not the seven, it's the eight.
[00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:07.620]   That's the eight, right?
[00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:09.580]   Or whatever comes out in 2017.
[00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:15.140]   Or I wouldn't be surprised if it's a 6X or something like that, another 6-up.
[00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:17.220]   They're not tied to the TikTok, right?
[00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:18.220]   They don't have to do that.
[00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:20.140]   Yeah, they don't have to do it.
[00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:21.140]   It's challenging.
[00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:22.140]   That would be a lot.
[00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:26.220]   It's hard because what are you going to put in a phone nowadays that's going to be the
[00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:28.700]   next big thing in a phone?
[00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:33.180]   Samsung with Samsung Pay, I think, showed that they do have some legs in face of Apple
[00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:34.180]   Pay.
[00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:37.100]   It actually works quite well.
[00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:40.740]   Every time I use it, the guy says, "It's used to the airport," because it works with
[00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:41.740]   the swipe machines.
[00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:43.780]   They're still surprisingly a lot of swipe machines out there.
[00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:45.820]   I thought they'd be all gone by now.
[00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:46.820]   I used it at the airport.
[00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:47.820]   I said, "Oh, I've never seen that.
[00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:51.220]   It works just like the ad."
[00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:52.220]   That shows you something.
[00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:54.260]   Samsung's marketing is getting through.
[00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:56.260]   People are aware of Samsung.
[00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:58.300]   They're going to survive that eight, 10 problem.
[00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:02.220]   That really was, I think, a big problem for all Android devices last year.
[00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:03.500]   Maybe Apple should be worried on it, right?
[00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:05.740]   I don't know.
[00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:10.060]   Maybe Android has an Android achieve parity?
[00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:12.300]   I think in terms of devices, yeah.
[00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:13.980]   The fingerprint readers are as fast.
[00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:15.140]   Apple owned that for a while.
[00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:16.140]   This is fast.
[00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:17.140]   Yeah.
[00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:18.140]   The cameras are getting up there.
[00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:19.140]   Oh, getting up there.
[00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:20.460]   I think the S7 is arguably better.
[00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:21.460]   S7 is better.
[00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:22.460]   Yeah.
[00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:24.460]   What we've seen from the 10, probably not so much.
[00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:26.300]   The HTC T10, not so much.
[00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:27.300]   Yeah.
[00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:29.420]   The S7 is pretty darn good.
[00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:33.420]   It's more like, I also think, on the whole, on the mobile market, there's just not much
[00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:34.420]   that's exciting.
[00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:35.420]   Well, that's the other problem.
[00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:36.420]   It's evolutionary now.
[00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:37.420]   It's evolution.
[00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:38.420]   So quickly.
[00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:39.420]   Yeah.
[00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:40.420]   And the problem...
[00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:41.420]   Go ahead.
[00:22:41.420 --> 00:22:42.420]   Go ahead.
[00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:43.420]   No, no, ladies first.
[00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:44.420]   Oh.
[00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:45.420]   Or second at least.
[00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:46.420]   Maybe third, but definitely it's time.
[00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:47.420]   Thank you.
[00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:51.300]   Now, what I was going to say is the other thing is Samsung is burdened by still having
[00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:55.860]   some legacy products and still remaining edited and unfocused.
[00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:58.540]   I mean, Samsung still has a TV business.
[00:22:58.540 --> 00:22:59.540]   Yeah.
[00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:03.340]   And they're still trying to sell TVs in 2016, which to me seems hilarious.
[00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:07.900]   I don't know very many people who are buying TVs, especially on a global scale at this
[00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:08.900]   point.
[00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:12.500]   They also still, I think, are relatively unedited in terms of their product line.
[00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:14.220]   I think that they try to do a lot at once.
[00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:17.860]   And I think also when Samsung tastes success, like something off of the S7, they're more
[00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:21.220]   likely to expand and do more things rather than edit down.
[00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:26.020]   And I think that Apple has been able to sort of curb that by not chasing after every single
[00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:27.220]   market as it develops.
[00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:31.660]   Samsung did report their quarterly results, and they had very good quarterly results this
[00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:32.660]   week, right?
[00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:36.100]   And they like Apple and one of the things they own is OLEDs.
[00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:37.100]   Yeah.
[00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:39.620]   So they had very good growth in the movies, right?
[00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:43.500]   Because they're doing all this great display work and that'll transition to the phones
[00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:44.500]   eventually to you.
[00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:45.500]   I mean, it's over.
[00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:47.700]   Yeah, for big screens, but that tech helps the mobile screen.
[00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:49.660]   They don't want you to think it's over big screens.
[00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:51.980]   Now they're pushing not only 4K, but HDR.
[00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:53.980]   Is it over for big screens?
[00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:54.980]   Wait a minute.
[00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:55.980]   Slow down.
[00:23:55.980 --> 00:23:56.980]   Whoa.
[00:23:56.980 --> 00:23:57.980]   It's over for big screens.
[00:23:57.980 --> 00:23:58.980]   Nobody.
[00:23:58.980 --> 00:23:59.980]   I would say no.
[00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:05.420]   HDR at the very least has a much better room effect than 3D or 4K.
[00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:08.260]   That's the kind of thing where that's sort of, that's going to take some time as the
[00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:11.900]   content gets rolled out and people don't have that content lined up yet.
[00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:14.820]   But I'm not, and I also am not going to be the guy who goes, oh, this is going to be
[00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:16.380]   the thing that makes TVs big.
[00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:19.220]   Because I was one of the eight people who thought 3D TV was cool.
[00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:20.620]   So you're so wrong.
[00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:21.620]   You're so wrong.
[00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:26.980]   That being said, HDR, it's catching in an interesting way whether there's going to be
[00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:29.860]   content and a real consumer drive for it is a whole nother thing.
[00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:32.900]   But I don't count it out just yet.
[00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:33.900]   No, I agree.
[00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:34.900]   Defender HDR.
[00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:35.900]   I agree.
[00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:36.900]   I think it's very pretty.
[00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:40.660]   David, you say that because the young people watch on littler screens that they don't want
[00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:41.660]   to live or...
[00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:43.900]   I think that's probably what's happening to you.
[00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:48.020]   Like most people are watching what Snapchat content and YouTube content on phones or their
[00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:49.580]   tablets or something.
[00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:52.420]   That big screen experience just isn't imperative for so many people.
[00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:53.740]   No, I noticed that in our house.
[00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:58.460]   The 13-year-old rarely will sit down in front of the TV as we adults will.
[00:24:58.460 --> 00:24:59.780]   He's got his own screens.
[00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:00.780]   And that's what he watches.
[00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:01.780]   For the old fogies.
[00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:05.980]   It's the old fogies who sit in a living room in a sofa looking at a television set.
[00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:08.020]   You're an old foggy Sam.
[00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:09.220]   You look like an old foggy one.
[00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:11.460]   I'm watching you on my 50-inch TV right now.
[00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:12.900]   Oh, do we look good?
[00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:14.060]   Do we look great?
[00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:15.060]   He looks fantastic.
[00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:16.220]   Very not pixelated at all.
[00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:17.220]   Hi, Deaf.
[00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:19.820]   Normally, I would speak as an expert for the teens.
[00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:22.740]   But this week I actually aged up into a new demographic bracket.
[00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:23.740]   Did you buy a TV?
[00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:27.380]   No, I already have a TV because I'm still kind of...
[00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:28.380]   Wait a minute.
[00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:29.380]   Are you 25?
[00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:30.380]   I'm 26 now.
[00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:31.580]   Oh my God, I can't believe that.
[00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:33.580]   So, you're no longer a millennial.
[00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:34.580]   You're now a willenial.
[00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:35.580]   Is that how that works?
[00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:36.580]   Yes.
[00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:37.580]   What's a willenial?
[00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:38.580]   Yeah.
[00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:39.580]   Will2K happened.
[00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:42.060]   A really bad Will Smith album that I like to reference whenever possible.
[00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:44.060]   I'm sorry for that.
[00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:46.060]   Really, there's a Will Smith album called Willenial?
[00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:47.060]   Will Call Willenial.
[00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:48.060]   Willenial.
[00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:50.540]   He was trying to make it clear that the next thousand years were going to be all about
[00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:51.540]   Will Smith.
[00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:54.700]   He's actually writing a psychology thing that's a whole other tangent.
[00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:55.700]   Sorry about that.
[00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:56.700]   The thousand year WIC-D-WAA.
[00:25:56.700 --> 00:25:57.700]   I'm excited.
[00:25:57.700 --> 00:26:00.580]   Yeah, but I do think though that you're right.
[00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:06.220]   A lot of young people see TVs as something that's like, again, like a nice to have item,
[00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:09.300]   but at the end of the day, they're going to spend thousands on their laptop or their
[00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:10.860]   mobile phone or their peripheral.
[00:26:10.860 --> 00:26:14.180]   The question is whether that will change when you get out of the little apartment,
[00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:18.140]   when you get in a bigger place and you have a living room and you kind of have a family
[00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:19.420]   and you gather together.
[00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:21.340]   Or is that old hat behavior?
[00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:22.500]   That's what I don't really know.
[00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:25.980]   The one thing I would say is that console sales are really high.
[00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:31.500]   The Xbox One and the PlayStation 4, it's interesting that their lifespan right now is
[00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:33.300]   way past what the Xbox 360 is.
[00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:34.940]   Yeah, but really high for these is what?
[00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:38.140]   A couple hundred million total, right?
[00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:41.700]   There is an interest from young, because it's younger people who are buying consoles.
[00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:43.260]   It's not necessarily 55 year olds.
[00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:45.820]   So there's still an interest in sitting down on the TV.
[00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:50.940]   I do think obviously phones and laptops are bigger, but I just want to make sure, I don't
[00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:52.260]   know why I'm defending television.
[00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:53.260]   I feel very free.
[00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:55.060]   No, I'll do that with you.
[00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:58.740]   You and me, because you're over 50 now and I think that that's what happens.
[00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:00.260]   You watch a lot more TV.
[00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:01.260]   Absolutely.
[00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:02.260]   No, I'm just teasing.
[00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:03.260]   Just not moving.
[00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:04.260]   It's great.
[00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:05.260]   It feels great.
[00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:08.180]   If I had my way, everybody would look closer at projectors or something, but now well.
[00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:13.620]   I think it's very interesting because you're right that the big screen market seems to
[00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:14.620]   be tanking.
[00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:19.340]   Sony, that's killing their profits.
[00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:22.140]   I think they're going to get out of that business like this year.
[00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:26.740]   Sony had a bunch of problems, but Visio, I haven't seen their numbers or anything,
[00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:29.300]   but the TVs they're making are pretty incredible.
[00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:33.940]   They came out with a very aggressively priced P series that everybody's, and this is by
[00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:36.580]   the way, an HDR TV, just like Sam was talking about.
[00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:38.340]   With full backlit, like UHT premium.
[00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:39.980]   Full backlit array too, which is really nice.
[00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:40.980]   Not just around the edge.
[00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:43.380]   And relatively inexpensive, right?
[00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:45.740]   Starts at $1000 for the 50 inch model.
[00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:47.220]   That's pretty good.
[00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:50.660]   This was kind of a shock when they announced this a couple of weeks ago because, in fact,
[00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:55.180]   I know Josh, one of our editors was really upset because he had bought the day before
[00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:56.820]   a Samsung TV.
[00:27:56.820 --> 00:27:58.220]   Ouch.
[00:27:58.220 --> 00:28:03.980]   And this was these new P series are a really light years better for less money.
[00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:05.060]   They look amazing.
[00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:09.260]   Like I saw one in a blacked out room, like no lights on in the room.
[00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:14.740]   And it was playing something from a man of steel and the black levels are just so insane.
[00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:19.220]   And the light, like the brightness they can get in certain instances too, just looks
[00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:20.220]   so much better.
[00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:21.220]   I have a plasma right now.
[00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:24.660]   That was kind of the thing you want to get for good black levels, but it seems like
[00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:26.740]   Vizio has pretty much made it there.
[00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:30.740]   The only problem with these TVs is that there's no TV tuner, which is a weird choice.
[00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:33.780]   Like they say, when we asked to clarify about that, they're like, well, we don't really
[00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:34.780]   call them TVs.
[00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:35.780]   They're monitoring.
[00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:36.780]   They're monitoring.
[00:28:36.780 --> 00:28:37.780]   They're monitoring.
[00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:38.780]   I want a monitor.
[00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:39.780]   That's thank you.
[00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:41.300]   This stupid smart TV thing.
[00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:42.820]   Like Samsung's so-called.
[00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:47.140]   I get I'm watching a TV show on my Samsung and I got a pop up saying, oh, by the way, we're
[00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:50.100]   going to discontinue Skype in a couple of months.
[00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:51.100]   Just want to let you know.
[00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:54.380]   And I have to click OK to get it off my screen.
[00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:55.860]   I don't want a smart TV.
[00:28:55.860 --> 00:28:56.940]   That's a half smart TV.
[00:28:56.940 --> 00:28:57.940]   That's worse than the dumb TV.
[00:28:57.940 --> 00:29:01.620]   It's I mean, yeah, it's still smart in some ways because it's all about Google cast and
[00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:03.580]   everything, but still like TV TV.
[00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:09.940]   These TVs come with a tablet that is now your six inch tablet remote.
[00:29:09.940 --> 00:29:11.820]   It's wild.
[00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:16.900]   So you're saying that they don't have any like you can't watch Netflix on the TV.
[00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:18.260]   You have to use Chromecast.
[00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:19.500]   It's all with the app.
[00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:21.460]   I mean, because the app is right there on the phone.
[00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:26.500]   So they've sort of like just they've taken out all the smart apps and just put them right
[00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:27.500]   there on the phone.
[00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:30.300]   Any mobile device would work on it too, which is pretty cool.
[00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:32.460]   The thing I was talking about though was the TV tuner.
[00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:35.700]   Like there's no there's no more over there antenna for this.
[00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:36.700]   Right.
[00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:37.700]   That's an ethical right.
[00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:38.700]   Yeah, I'm not sure.
[00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:43.740]   It was a nice thing to have, especially now that, you know, anybody can buy a $20 antenna
[00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:46.780]   and get really great looking HD stuff from over the air.
[00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:50.020]   It's the best HD out there is the best deal anyway.
[00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:51.020]   Yeah, it's compressed.
[00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:52.020]   Yeah, it's the least compressed.
[00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:54.300]   It's the only way I watch the Batriller at.
[00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:55.300]   That's how I get it.
[00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:58.340]   I get that pure over the air signal when I look at the rose ceremony.
[00:29:58.340 --> 00:29:59.340]   Otherwise I am out.
[00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:00.340]   There you go.
[00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:01.340]   Okay.
[00:30:01.340 --> 00:30:07.780]   All right, let's take a break on that note.
[00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:11.420]   Nothing to say is the rose really red.
[00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:13.420]   It's really the red is beautiful.
[00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:14.740]   We will find out after that.
[00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:16.940]   The great weather Leo gets the rose.
[00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:24.660]   There are $8,000 LGO leads, which probably have, you know, at least on paper a better
[00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:26.020]   screen.
[00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:28.580]   But who's going to spend that much money on TV?
[00:30:28.580 --> 00:30:31.420]   No, I haven't bought it yet.
[00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:32.420]   I do have an OLED.
[00:30:32.420 --> 00:30:33.420]   I like my OLED a lot.
[00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:34.420]   Oh, nice.
[00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:40.140]   I don't, I think like plasma was definitely better than LCD, but it died because no people
[00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:41.140]   aren't going to buy it.
[00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:42.340]   It's too expensive to make.
[00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:43.340]   Yeah.
[00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:45.140]   And LCD just got cheaper and cheaper.
[00:30:45.140 --> 00:30:46.220]   Well, it's great.
[00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:47.620]   It's just so expensive.
[00:30:47.620 --> 00:30:50.100]   Are these these videos or LCD, right?
[00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:51.100]   You said full back.
[00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:52.460]   Those are those are LCD.
[00:30:52.460 --> 00:30:53.460]   Yeah.
[00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:56.340]   Is it some special kind of magic LCD?
[00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:57.620]   It's not like Samsung's thing.
[00:30:57.620 --> 00:30:58.620]   They're using those.
[00:30:58.620 --> 00:30:59.940]   Forget the name of those.
[00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:00.940]   Quantum dots.
[00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:01.940]   Quantum dots.
[00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:02.940]   Yeah.
[00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:03.940]   That's like a special layer on top of the display.
[00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:04.940]   There's no quantum dots.
[00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:05.940]   Oh, screw that.
[00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:06.940]   I'm not buying it.
[00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:11.220]   Well, what's interesting is that Samsung's new TVs are pretty much all edge lit.
[00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:12.780]   So that's not as good.
[00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:13.780]   Yeah.
[00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:14.780]   Not as good backlighting.
[00:31:14.780 --> 00:31:18.100]   The black levels, I haven't like compared them, but the fact that Vizio is able to get
[00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:19.420]   like a full array out there.
[00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:20.780]   We're so cheap.
[00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:22.940]   That's pretty surprising.
[00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:25.500]   That's Devinder Harder, our senior editor at Engadget.
[00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:28.020]   He also co hosts film cast.
[00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:30.020]   Yes, it's a flash film cast.
[00:31:30.020 --> 00:31:31.020]   Flash film.
[00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:33.380]   Don't forget the slash slash film cast.
[00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:35.380]   Have you reviewed the Jungle Book yet?
[00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:36.380]   Because that was just...
[00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:37.380]   I did.
[00:31:37.380 --> 00:31:38.380]   I loved it.
[00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:39.380]   Isn't that amazing?
[00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:40.380]   Yeah.
[00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:41.380]   So good.
[00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:42.380]   I was actually surprised.
[00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:43.740]   I went into it misremembering who made it.
[00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:47.140]   I thought it was the Andy Serkis version, which isn't coming out until 2018.
[00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:48.140]   There's going to be another...
[00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:49.140]   Wait a minute.
[00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:50.140]   There's going to be another Jungle Book within here.
[00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:51.140]   There's going to be another one.
[00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:52.140]   Lord knows.
[00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:54.660]   If you like the movie, so nice, you watched it twice.
[00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:56.380]   Is Disney making the second one?
[00:31:56.380 --> 00:31:57.860]   No, that's Warner Brothers.
[00:31:57.860 --> 00:31:58.860]   Warner Brothers has.
[00:31:58.860 --> 00:31:59.860]   I don't know.
[00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:03.220]   It's just the fact that Warner Brothers jumped on it and Disney said, "Oh, well, we got to
[00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:06.220]   get on the Jungle Book train."
[00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:07.860]   But that's what happened.
[00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:09.620]   Disney's on that road.
[00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:10.620]   Yeah.
[00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:15.000]   It was the FX team behind the Pirates of the Caribbean movies, and they'd never done
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:20.660]   anything with this kind of specific animal tech and all CGI-generated animals that PETA
[00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:24.260]   actually gave an award to because of the fact that there were no animals even close to me.
[00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:26.260]   No, no bits were harmed in this movie.
[00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:27.260]   No bits were harmed.
[00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:28.260]   The human, however, really suffered.
[00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:31.460]   He had to go through mud, and it was just terrible.
[00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:32.460]   Yeah.
[00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:35.900]   They were brilliant because they eliminated the uncanny valley problem.
[00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:39.060]   The only thing that we have a problem with is human animation.
[00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:42.180]   So they made the human real at everything else in the movie.
[00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:44.300]   Practically, everything else in the movie.
[00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:46.220]   Even the environments, yeah.
[00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:47.220]   Yeah.
[00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:48.220]   It's a good YouTube video.
[00:32:48.220 --> 00:32:53.300]   I showed this a couple of weeks ago on the stream where you can see the green screen
[00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:57.580]   and how much of, you know, mowglies, like there's, they make a muddy, like a little muddy
[00:32:57.580 --> 00:33:01.660]   valley with green screen everywhere, and he has to slog through the mud.
[00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:04.460]   Just because you can't get, you know, you can't do computer simulated mud.
[00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:05.660]   This doesn't really work, I guess.
[00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:06.660]   I don't know.
[00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:10.220]   But most of it was CGI and really so well done.
[00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:13.020]   The thing I really loved, I just was using the Gear VR.
[00:33:13.020 --> 00:33:17.540]   There's a tran, or you can see it on YouTube too if you have cardboard.
[00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:25.140]   You can be in King Louie's, you know, palace as where Mowgli would be and look around while
[00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:26.780]   Christopher Walken's talking to you.
[00:33:26.780 --> 00:33:31.500]   It's a really amazing experience, a really good example of where immersive filmmaking
[00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:32.660]   might have somewhere to go.
[00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:38.020]   I guess when you're making a CGI movie, you get the 3D thing for free, right?
[00:33:38.020 --> 00:33:41.020]   Because you're making a model so you can look around.
[00:33:41.020 --> 00:33:45.060]   Yeah, here's the, this is the, so you can see how little real stuff, they shut the whole
[00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:46.620]   thing in LA.
[00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:50.060]   And by the way, that puppet is really, really realistic.
[00:33:50.060 --> 00:33:55.660]   No, that's what he's, he's talking to a puppet instead of an actual bear.
[00:33:55.660 --> 00:33:59.740]   It looks like, gosh, that looks like the sn, there was that terrible show on the WB that
[00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:02.940]   was a really bad rip off of Married With Children and it had a dust bunny that was voiced by
[00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:03.940]   Bobcat.
[00:34:03.940 --> 00:34:04.940]   Oh yeah.
[00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:06.940]   Wait, that's what that thing looks like.
[00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:08.580]   Also I just noticed the little sock creature.
[00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:10.180]   Yeah, there's sock creatures behind him.
[00:34:10.180 --> 00:34:14.460]   Well, Mowgli's like seven years old, they had to give him something to look at.
[00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:15.980]   I guess.
[00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:16.980]   It's a good movie.
[00:34:16.980 --> 00:34:17.980]   I'm glad you reviewed it.
[00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:18.980]   I thought it was making a joke.
[00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:19.980]   I thought, oh, they wouldn't talk about that in a slash.
[00:34:19.980 --> 00:34:20.980]   Oh, yeah.
[00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:26.500]   So this is in the process of turning all their major animated movies into live action.
[00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:27.500]   So that's very interesting.
[00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:30.100]   What other ones are they going to do?
[00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:32.020]   I mean, they did Cinderella.
[00:34:32.020 --> 00:34:33.020]   Yeah.
[00:34:33.020 --> 00:34:34.020]   Your hand is coming.
[00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:36.020]   Like there's a whole bunch.
[00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:37.020]   Yeah.
[00:34:37.020 --> 00:34:38.020]   Cinderella, I heard it wasn't bad.
[00:34:38.020 --> 00:34:41.780]   I haven't seen that one, but this one just because it's John Travro and the, the CG is
[00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:42.780]   just stunning.
[00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:43.780]   It's stunning.
[00:34:43.780 --> 00:34:44.780]   So good.
[00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:45.780]   You think it's real.
[00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:46.780]   You think you're in the jungle.
[00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:50.820]   And best use of 3D, I think since Avatar, like just fantastic 3D.
[00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:52.820]   And it didn't seem like there was much.
[00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:54.900]   And then she was with the 3D screening I saw.
[00:34:54.900 --> 00:34:56.100]   I didn't see much 3D screening.
[00:34:56.100 --> 00:34:58.260]   I saw everything kind of like paper cutouts.
[00:34:58.260 --> 00:35:01.900]   It looked, it was all this weird flat sort of thing.
[00:35:01.900 --> 00:35:02.900]   Yeah, I was, I was.
[00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:04.460]   It sounds like a protectors.
[00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:05.460]   Yeah.
[00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:06.460]   You're.
[00:35:06.460 --> 00:35:08.620]   Yeah, I blame, I blame fake IMAX.
[00:35:08.620 --> 00:35:09.620]   You know, you know, that's it.
[00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:11.020]   It only has to be like a few inches bigger.
[00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:12.660]   And then all of a sudden they call it IMAX.
[00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:15.500]   Yeah, fake IMAX is not good.
[00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:17.500]   Same, uh, Moskovitz.
[00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:20.500]   Same way.
[00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:21.500]   Moskovitz.
[00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:22.980]   Say it 8 times.
[00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:24.540]   Moskovitz is here.
[00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:25.540]   He's with our his technica.
[00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:26.860]   I'm so sorry.
[00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:28.540]   It's because I look at the spelling.
[00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:32.500]   No, you just have to, you have to feel the name.
[00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:35.740]   You close your eyes and you hum a little tune to yourself.
[00:35:35.740 --> 00:35:37.460]   And then Moskovitz will come out of your mouth.
[00:35:37.460 --> 00:35:38.460]   Moskovitz.
[00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:39.460]   Moskovitz.
[00:35:39.460 --> 00:35:42.500]   I used to have an attorney named Moskovitz, but he didn't spell it the same way.
[00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:43.580]   He was a tax attorney.
[00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:44.740]   He does ads in San Francisco.
[00:35:44.740 --> 00:35:45.740]   You've probably heard him.
[00:35:45.740 --> 00:35:47.780]   I'm Stephen Moskovitz.
[00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:51.260]   If you're going to jail, I can help.
[00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:52.820]   Haven't filed taxes in years?
[00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:53.820]   I can help.
[00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:54.820]   Have you heard those ads?
[00:35:54.820 --> 00:35:55.820]   No.
[00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:56.820]   No.
[00:35:56.820 --> 00:35:57.820]   You don't listen to that for radio.
[00:35:57.820 --> 00:36:01.940]   That's Lauren Hockett's in a young person.
[00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:05.100]   Now, now in a new demographic era.
[00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:06.100]   I know.
[00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:07.340]   It was really sad.
[00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:10.940]   You know, I had to like check a box on the census and like shed a tear.
[00:36:10.940 --> 00:36:11.940]   You don't know.
[00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:15.340]   What do you no longer in the 25 to 54?
[00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:16.340]   Then you'll be sad.
[00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:17.340]   Yeah.
[00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:20.020]   Well, yeah.
[00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:25.740]   In radio, in radio, we have a name for the demographic after 25 to 54.
[00:36:25.740 --> 00:36:27.460]   It's 55 to dead.
[00:36:27.460 --> 00:36:28.460]   Oh, I've got that.
[00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:29.460]   I mean that demographic.
[00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:31.100]   Early bird special identities.
[00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:32.100]   Yeah.
[00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:33.100]   Yeah.
[00:36:33.100 --> 00:36:34.100]   430.
[00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:35.100]   Great.
[00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:36.100]   You get a deal.
[00:36:36.100 --> 00:36:37.100]   Grand Slam breakfast for like 350.
[00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:38.100]   It's amazing.
[00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:39.100]   That sounds awesome.
[00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:41.340]   Oh, I joined WAP right away.
[00:36:41.340 --> 00:36:45.580]   Also with also with a Stavindra Hardewar.
[00:36:45.580 --> 00:36:46.580]   Did I mention you already?
[00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:48.420]   I think I gave you a double plug for men.
[00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:49.420]   Yeah.
[00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:50.420]   That's cool.
[00:36:50.420 --> 00:36:51.420]   That's okay.
[00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:52.420]   We'll have more in just a moment.
[00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:53.660]   I showed today brought to you by Wealthfront.
[00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:58.620]   Now, see when you're young like Lauren and you know, you're starting out in life, it's
[00:36:58.620 --> 00:36:59.700]   the last thing you want to do.
[00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:04.700]   You probably don't even have a lot of extra money is put money into retirement.
[00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:08.940]   Believe me, the money you put down in retirement is worth so much more than the money you're
[00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:11.020]   going to put it in 20 years.
[00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:12.020]   It starts growing now.
[00:37:12.020 --> 00:37:14.780]   So it's really important to start saving for your future.
[00:37:14.780 --> 00:37:18.860]   You probably also want to save for that down payment in a house and maybe you know, you're
[00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:21.940]   going to have kids someday save for college long term savings.
[00:37:21.940 --> 00:37:23.780]   It's important, but the question is where do you put it?
[00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:26.460]   Do you put it in a savings account?
[00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:30.460]   Because that's like, you're going to lose money.
[00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:31.860]   They pay so little interest.
[00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:32.860]   Okay.
[00:37:32.860 --> 00:37:33.860]   You're going to invest, right?
[00:37:33.860 --> 00:37:34.860]   Are you going to hire an investment advisor?
[00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:39.100]   You know, they charge between one and three percent of the money they manage every year.
[00:37:39.100 --> 00:37:41.940]   That's how much more you'd have to make just to break even.
[00:37:41.940 --> 00:37:43.380]   And that is not easy.
[00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:45.460]   So let a computer do it.
[00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:50.300]   Wealthfront, computers only charge you one quarter of one percent a year.
[00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:53.500]   That's nothing and no commissions, no hidden fees.
[00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:57.380]   And by the way, they do a better job because unlike an advisor who might check your account
[00:37:57.380 --> 00:38:02.900]   every few months, Wealthfront is checking your account every minute, constantly monitoring
[00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:04.940]   it, rebalancing.
[00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:09.940]   They do something called tax loss harvesting that's the idea is to maximize your return
[00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:12.460]   and minimize your tax.
[00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:15.180]   That's based on modern portfolio theory.
[00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:18.700]   And what they do with just a few questions, they adjust their investments according to
[00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:20.580]   your personal risk tolerance.
[00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:21.740]   They keep you diversified.
[00:38:21.740 --> 00:38:23.420]   They keep you tax efficient.
[00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:26.780]   And you know exactly what they're doing because you can view and track all your accounts
[00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:27.780]   in one place.
[00:38:27.780 --> 00:38:32.660]   In fact, you can even put your non- Wealthfront bank and brokerage accounts into the interface.
[00:38:32.660 --> 00:38:34.380]   So you'll see everything.
[00:38:34.380 --> 00:38:36.060]   Now all your money is doing.
[00:38:36.060 --> 00:38:38.180]   Now I want you to go to wealthfront.com and read about it.
[00:38:38.180 --> 00:38:41.820]   Actually go to wealthfront.com/twits so they know where you heard about it.
[00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:44.780]   Obviously you're not going to invest until you read about it.
[00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:47.700]   Find out how it all works.
[00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:50.540]   You should also take advantage of a couple of free things they'll give you.
[00:38:50.540 --> 00:38:54.660]   You can answer the few questions about risk tolerance and time frame and they'll generate
[00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:56.780]   a portfolio that's free.
[00:38:56.780 --> 00:38:58.620]   You can see what they would invest in for you.
[00:38:58.620 --> 00:39:02.820]   They'll also look at your existing portfolio if you want and you'll find out where you're
[00:39:02.820 --> 00:39:07.180]   wasting money on additional fees and services and whether it's fully diversified, how its
[00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:09.900]   risk level is and all that stuff.
[00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:11.380]   This works so well.
[00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:13.300]   Wealthfront has been growing like crazy.
[00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:17.260]   They now manage almost $3 billion in client assets.
[00:39:17.260 --> 00:39:21.580]   It's because they've got the best software, the best people and it's very affordable.
[00:39:21.580 --> 00:39:23.060]   Less than one quarter, one percent.
[00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:24.620]   Tell you what, I got a better deal.
[00:39:24.620 --> 00:39:28.860]   You can start with as little as $500 and the first $15,000 you put in will be free of
[00:39:28.860 --> 00:39:29.860]   charge forever.
[00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:33.220]   It's 0% a year.
[00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:37.660]   Wealthfront.com/twit, great returns, low cost.
[00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:44.460]   They're doing it right and it's time whether you're investing for your first year in the
[00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:45.900]   marketplace or your last.
[00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:49.260]   This is the time to do it.
[00:39:49.260 --> 00:39:52.460]   Wealthfront.com/twit.
[00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:53.780]   So we recalled Sam.
[00:39:53.780 --> 00:39:55.660]   I think his picture was deteriorating.
[00:39:55.660 --> 00:39:57.180]   It's better now.
[00:39:57.180 --> 00:39:59.620]   Sam Moskowitz is here.
[00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:01.420]   There's no it's in Moskowitz.
[00:40:01.420 --> 00:40:03.500]   You're getting there.
[00:40:03.500 --> 00:40:05.940]   I believe in you.
[00:40:05.940 --> 00:40:07.380]   That's Lauren Hockinson.
[00:40:07.380 --> 00:40:12.660]   Good to have you from the Nothing Matters cast, which sounds kind of nihilistic action,
[00:40:12.660 --> 00:40:13.660]   but it's not.
[00:40:13.660 --> 00:40:15.740]   You're very upbeat and positive about the world.
[00:40:15.740 --> 00:40:20.540]   Yeah, like I said before we started taping, just like Seinfeld is a show about nothing,
[00:40:20.540 --> 00:40:23.180]   I believe that Twitter is a social media network about nothing.
[00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:24.740]   So this is a show about Twitter?
[00:40:24.740 --> 00:40:25.740]   Yes.
[00:40:25.740 --> 00:40:26.740]   Interesting.
[00:40:26.740 --> 00:40:29.140]   Sounds like it's about Snapchat actually, but I don't know.
[00:40:29.140 --> 00:40:30.140]   Snapchat, so useless.
[00:40:30.140 --> 00:40:31.140]   Come on.
[00:40:31.140 --> 00:40:32.140]   We're all available.
[00:40:32.140 --> 00:40:33.580]   Yeah, platforms for the kids.
[00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:34.580]   Snapchat, Instagram.
[00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:36.500]   Be Tomo.
[00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:42.140]   Did you see that Chris Saka, who is a big Snapchat investor, has made probably more than
[00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:44.180]   a billion dollars on his investment?
[00:40:44.180 --> 00:40:45.820]   Did I say Snapchat?
[00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:47.460]   I meant Twitter.
[00:40:47.460 --> 00:40:51.300]   Said the Twitter is making a mistake because they're not paying enough attention to black
[00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:52.460]   Twitter.
[00:40:52.460 --> 00:40:56.020]   He said that's really where all the growth and excitement is as African Americans using
[00:40:56.020 --> 00:40:57.020]   Twitter.
[00:40:57.020 --> 00:40:58.620]   There's nobody black on the board.
[00:40:58.620 --> 00:41:05.260]   There's in fact the guy, the person in charge of diversity at Twitter is a white guy, which
[00:41:05.260 --> 00:41:07.380]   is not very diverse.
[00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:09.980]   You know, yeah, it's rough.
[00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:13.780]   It's weird because Twitter is like they don't understand the platform at all.
[00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:15.580]   And yeah, that's really what he's saying.
[00:41:15.580 --> 00:41:18.180]   They have no idea what they're doing.
[00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:21.940]   Yeah, black Twitter is also magic though.
[00:41:21.940 --> 00:41:22.940]   It really is.
[00:41:22.940 --> 00:41:24.380]   It's one of the best places to go on Twitter.
[00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:25.380]   Where is that?
[00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:26.380]   How do I get to this neighborhood?
[00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:27.380]   I don't know.
[00:41:27.380 --> 00:41:30.620]   It's one of those things where you know how to get there.
[00:41:30.620 --> 00:41:32.260]   You just have to know.
[00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:37.300]   Yeah, you draw the portal into the wall with the chalk and you sprinkle the dust.
[00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:39.500]   Saka says Twitter is black Twitter.
[00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:42.460]   That's where the hashtags happen where the excitement is.
[00:41:42.460 --> 00:41:47.580]   Yeah, they had a really great week this past week because of course Beyonce released her
[00:41:47.580 --> 00:41:50.540]   new visual album and HBO special.
[00:41:50.540 --> 00:41:51.940]   It wasn't that some.
[00:41:51.940 --> 00:41:52.940]   That's amazing.
[00:41:52.940 --> 00:41:53.940]   It is amazing.
[00:41:53.940 --> 00:41:55.780]   Wow, took a baseball bat to my brain.
[00:41:55.780 --> 00:41:57.820]   Yeah, holy cow.
[00:41:57.820 --> 00:42:00.660]   We'll talk about that a bit because she also, well, we can talk about it now.
[00:42:00.660 --> 00:42:06.100]   She did, she's brilliant at marketing, released the video.
[00:42:06.100 --> 00:42:07.100]   It's an hour long.
[00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:10.620]   It's almost a documentary as much as a video album, right?
[00:42:10.620 --> 00:42:13.900]   And released it of course as the show before Game of Thrones.
[00:42:13.900 --> 00:42:16.380]   Not a bad place to have.
[00:42:16.380 --> 00:42:18.060]   I cannot see it on demand now though.
[00:42:18.060 --> 00:42:19.460]   I think you had to watch it then.
[00:42:19.460 --> 00:42:20.460]   It was limited time.
[00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:25.540]   She had one, he was a one day only for the video version and then you had to go to title
[00:42:25.540 --> 00:42:26.780]   exclusively for streaming.
[00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:28.740]   I believe it's for sale on iTunes though.
[00:42:28.740 --> 00:42:29.740]   Isn't that crazy?
[00:42:29.740 --> 00:42:30.740]   Isn't that weird?
[00:42:30.740 --> 00:42:36.940]   So her husband Jay Zones title and title is another one of those streaming services.
[00:42:36.940 --> 00:42:41.740]   There's not a lot to distinguish except for their exclusives and because it's owned by
[00:42:41.740 --> 00:42:43.820]   somebody in the music business they seem to do.
[00:42:43.820 --> 00:42:46.340]   And also that their app is garbage.
[00:42:46.340 --> 00:42:47.500]   Is it that bad?
[00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:54.100]   Everybody at ours is starting to get, they can maintain the stream across many different
[00:42:54.100 --> 00:42:55.100]   devices.
[00:42:55.100 --> 00:42:57.180]   There's a sweet spot where title is just great.
[00:42:57.180 --> 00:42:59.740]   Aren't they streaming CD quality?
[00:42:59.740 --> 00:43:01.220]   Yeah they're doing flack.
[00:43:01.220 --> 00:43:02.220]   They're doing to-
[00:43:02.220 --> 00:43:03.220]   Yeah, lost.
[00:43:03.220 --> 00:43:04.220]   Uncompressed.
[00:43:04.220 --> 00:43:05.740]   Well that should sound a lot.
[00:43:05.740 --> 00:43:08.220]   That was one of their big teases from the very beginning yet.
[00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:10.500]   Neil Young music weirdly.
[00:43:10.500 --> 00:43:11.500]   It sounds great.
[00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:15.500]   I mean I had to re-download title after the death of Prince and got lemonade sort of rolled
[00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:16.500]   into the-
[00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:18.500]   Do they have an exclusive on Prince as well?
[00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:20.420]   Yes Prince moved his entire catalog over there.
[00:43:20.420 --> 00:43:24.980]   I believe that he has some select songs specifically from hit and run to available on
[00:43:24.980 --> 00:43:25.980]   Spotify and some other places.
[00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:26.980]   How about Tay Tay?
[00:43:26.980 --> 00:43:27.980]   Is she over there?
[00:43:27.980 --> 00:43:28.980]   Yes.
[00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:29.980]   Okay.
[00:43:29.980 --> 00:43:30.980]   She is.
[00:43:30.980 --> 00:43:33.980]   So do they give artists more money or is it the relationships that Jay Z has?
[00:43:33.980 --> 00:43:37.740]   I think it's probably a combo of both but the problem is you know it doesn't matter if
[00:43:37.740 --> 00:43:45.340]   you can have you know a lossless stream of princes 1999 if it skips and pauses.
[00:43:45.340 --> 00:43:49.260]   And that's my problem is that I always have to look up and question whether or not my
[00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:51.940]   internet is working because for some reason the stream will just stop.
[00:43:51.940 --> 00:43:53.700]   Well that's very frustrating.
[00:43:53.700 --> 00:43:55.580]   It's like the authentic record playing experience.
[00:43:55.580 --> 00:43:57.580]   You gotta have those skips in there.
[00:43:57.580 --> 00:43:58.580]   Yeah.
[00:43:58.580 --> 00:44:02.500]   Well but then Beyonce is brilliant because they only had a 24 hour exclusive before she
[00:44:02.500 --> 00:44:04.620]   went to iTunes to sell it.
[00:44:04.620 --> 00:44:09.900]   So and of course if you're a Beyonce fan you're going to buy it right?
[00:44:09.900 --> 00:44:10.900]   So very.
[00:44:10.900 --> 00:44:15.460]   24 hours before Game of Thrones 2 and also tie into HBO's free weekend like this is like
[00:44:15.460 --> 00:44:19.540]   like a layer upon layer of marketing yeah working together.
[00:44:19.540 --> 00:44:23.340]   The sad thing is that only somebody with her clout in the industry could do this and it
[00:44:23.340 --> 00:44:26.660]   so it doesn't benefit up and coming artists.
[00:44:26.660 --> 00:44:31.420]   It shows maybe a path for once you've made it but it doesn't really show the future of
[00:44:31.420 --> 00:44:32.420]   the music industry.
[00:44:32.420 --> 00:44:33.420]   It just shows.
[00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:37.140]   I want to agree I think the idea of a video album is a very attainable thing.
[00:44:37.140 --> 00:44:38.260]   It doesn't cost a lot.
[00:44:38.260 --> 00:44:39.260]   That's true.
[00:44:39.260 --> 00:44:41.580]   Yet even your smartphone should probably have a pretty decent camera.
[00:44:41.580 --> 00:44:42.660]   But nobody's going to watch it.
[00:44:42.660 --> 00:44:44.300]   I think that's why not.
[00:44:44.300 --> 00:44:49.420]   There's been lots of like indie videos being produced but yeah it's the audience that you
[00:44:49.420 --> 00:44:50.420]   really get by.
[00:44:50.420 --> 00:44:54.460]   It's who are making music now over the next five, six years to really experiment with
[00:44:54.460 --> 00:44:56.940]   video albums and even virtual reality albums.
[00:44:56.940 --> 00:44:57.940]   Who knows what's to come.
[00:44:57.940 --> 00:45:04.180]   And I think it's unlocking not only that as a form but also I think for Beyonce as a woman
[00:45:04.180 --> 00:45:07.740]   and a person of color to come forward and say I'm going to make something top to bottom
[00:45:07.740 --> 00:45:09.220]   and control it.
[00:45:09.220 --> 00:45:10.460]   And I think that really matters.
[00:45:10.460 --> 00:45:15.500]   I think that makes an impression on between that and the access to cheap technology to
[00:45:15.500 --> 00:45:17.740]   make that and record that sort of stuff.
[00:45:17.740 --> 00:45:19.540]   That will have an effect down the line.
[00:45:19.540 --> 00:45:20.540]   That does splash down.
[00:45:20.540 --> 00:45:24.380]   Also, I did look up the amount per play.
[00:45:24.380 --> 00:45:31.180]   Google Play actually pays the most at 73 hundreds of a penny per play title right next to it's
[00:45:31.180 --> 00:45:33.420]   70 hundreds of a penny.
[00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:36.300]   Beats is 30 hundreds of a penny, retents of a penny.
[00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:39.060]   And then Rhapsody, Apple Music, Spotify.
[00:45:39.060 --> 00:45:40.060]   Something called Deezer.
[00:45:40.060 --> 00:45:41.060]   Yeah.
[00:45:41.060 --> 00:45:42.060]   It's a thing that exists.
[00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:43.060]   Deezer is big.
[00:45:43.060 --> 00:45:45.060]   Something called Deezer.
[00:45:45.060 --> 00:45:46.060]   Something called Deezer.
[00:45:46.060 --> 00:45:47.060]   That Deezer is awesome.
[00:45:47.060 --> 00:45:50.380]   Deezer was another one of the CD quality streaming services, right?
[00:45:50.380 --> 00:45:51.980]   And it's French.
[00:45:51.980 --> 00:45:54.900]   But owned now by Tidal or no?
[00:45:54.900 --> 00:45:55.900]   Who bought Deezer?
[00:45:55.900 --> 00:45:57.140]   Or is it the other way around?
[00:45:57.140 --> 00:45:58.620]   No, Deezer bought Stitcher.
[00:45:58.620 --> 00:45:59.620]   I'm sorry.
[00:45:59.620 --> 00:46:02.420]   It's hard to keep track of all this.
[00:46:02.420 --> 00:46:03.420]   Yeah.
[00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:06.180]   So Deezer is separate.
[00:46:06.180 --> 00:46:09.220]   So, but you said Google Play is number one.
[00:46:09.220 --> 00:46:10.660]   And then who's second Deezer?
[00:46:10.660 --> 00:46:11.660]   Title.
[00:46:11.660 --> 00:46:13.140]   No, Google Play and Title are right next to each other.
[00:46:13.140 --> 00:46:14.140]   They essentially pay the same.
[00:46:14.140 --> 00:46:15.140]   And then Deezer.
[00:46:15.140 --> 00:46:19.620]   They get more for Google Play and then Beats, the chart, I would show it to you.
[00:46:19.620 --> 00:46:21.500]   But I don't know that it would pick up on the screen.
[00:46:21.500 --> 00:46:23.340]   It's three tenths of a penny.
[00:46:23.340 --> 00:46:26.380]   But maybe they're not charging enough to keep their servers going.
[00:46:26.380 --> 00:46:27.380]   Right?
[00:46:27.380 --> 00:46:29.820]   I mean, if you don't have good quality service.
[00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:30.980]   Well, it's unclear.
[00:46:30.980 --> 00:46:33.780]   I find that it's unclear to figure out exactly what's going on.
[00:46:33.780 --> 00:46:36.860]   I don't know if it's a bug in their web app.
[00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:39.420]   If it's something with the server.
[00:46:39.420 --> 00:46:41.140]   But that's the problem.
[00:46:41.140 --> 00:46:46.180]   When you have technology companies like Apple and Google that you're competing with who
[00:46:46.180 --> 00:46:50.820]   do know how to run servers, who do know how to make software.
[00:46:50.820 --> 00:46:58.500]   Except I will say that the Apple music experience is infuriating on several levels to the point
[00:46:58.500 --> 00:47:02.540]   where I have often yelled at my phone because I just want to be able to play music that I
[00:47:02.540 --> 00:47:05.940]   already own that I already put on my phone and I don't have to.
[00:47:05.940 --> 00:47:08.940]   And I don't want to log into the internet to do that.
[00:47:08.940 --> 00:47:09.940]   Right.
[00:47:09.940 --> 00:47:13.460]   The way they show that in with the local library is insane.
[00:47:13.460 --> 00:47:14.980]   And I don't know.
[00:47:14.980 --> 00:47:19.620]   It feels almost like a like monopolistic in a way to like remember when that first launch,
[00:47:19.620 --> 00:47:23.620]   the first thing that happened when you launched the music app was like, Oh, sign up for Apple
[00:47:23.620 --> 00:47:26.140]   music instead of just like getting to your tracks.
[00:47:26.140 --> 00:47:29.180]   By the way, you go to title.com.
[00:47:29.180 --> 00:47:31.980]   There's no question who has the exclusive on lemonade.
[00:47:31.980 --> 00:47:35.100]   I mean, that is right in your face.
[00:47:35.100 --> 00:47:36.300]   Stream lemonade download lemonade.
[00:47:36.300 --> 00:47:42.980]   Yeah, Apple music definitely when we were just talking about Apple being a services company,
[00:47:42.980 --> 00:47:44.380]   there's a reason why we don't talk about it.
[00:47:44.380 --> 00:47:50.740]   And one is that Apple music launched like a plopping something or other and never really
[00:47:50.740 --> 00:47:51.740]   gamed up.
[00:47:51.740 --> 00:47:53.020]   I can't think of any really mind share.
[00:47:53.020 --> 00:47:56.140]   I can't think of anyone I know who says, Oh, yeah, Apple music.
[00:47:56.140 --> 00:47:58.820]   I just don't have a huge advantage if you're using an iPhone.
[00:47:58.820 --> 00:47:59.820]   It's on the iPhone.
[00:47:59.820 --> 00:48:00.820]   It's there.
[00:48:00.820 --> 00:48:01.820]   It's the default.
[00:48:01.820 --> 00:48:05.300]   No, no, you have to download Spotify.
[00:48:05.300 --> 00:48:07.540]   Apple, a life on comes with Apple.
[00:48:07.540 --> 00:48:10.500]   So you have to make you have to take an effort to get Spotify.
[00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:13.180]   It's like the old Internet Explorer, like thing, right?
[00:48:13.180 --> 00:48:15.740]   Like they have such a huge advantage because it's there downplay.
[00:48:15.740 --> 00:48:18.220]   Yeah, the tyranny of the default.
[00:48:18.220 --> 00:48:23.900]   I think having it on the they're going to, I expect, despite the fact that anybody, including
[00:48:23.900 --> 00:48:28.100]   this panel who uses it and compares it to the competition realizes it's it's it's it's
[00:48:28.100 --> 00:48:29.100]   also ran.
[00:48:29.100 --> 00:48:34.460]   Yeah, it'll be the uncool, but probably profitable because it's there and it'll continue to grow
[00:48:34.460 --> 00:48:36.220]   bit by bit, I imagine.
[00:48:36.220 --> 00:48:37.220]   Yeah.
[00:48:37.220 --> 00:48:40.900]   Well, so it's interesting because Apple music has, I think, two things in terms of mind share.
[00:48:40.900 --> 00:48:45.460]   One of them is beats one if you're hip, cool kid, all the yeah, the hot British clubhouse
[00:48:45.460 --> 00:48:47.700]   beats there there for you.
[00:48:47.700 --> 00:48:52.820]   But the second one actually is the other album that dropped with unfortunately, I think,
[00:48:52.820 --> 00:48:57.260]   a little bit less fanfare because lemonade is Drake's views from the six, which they have
[00:48:57.260 --> 00:49:02.660]   an exclusive on and one has an exclusive on Drake Apple music Apple music has an exclusive
[00:49:02.660 --> 00:49:04.660]   on Drake's views from the six.
[00:49:04.660 --> 00:49:09.500]   And that is done actually incredibly well and it had really great, I believe, very strong
[00:49:09.500 --> 00:49:12.780]   digital download sales.
[00:49:12.780 --> 00:49:14.340]   And he's not on Spotify.
[00:49:14.340 --> 00:49:15.340]   No.
[00:49:15.340 --> 00:49:18.500]   That's I think it's going to be the battle of the exclusives.
[00:49:18.500 --> 00:49:21.820]   It was, you know, when we're in console gaming, it was kind of the battle of the exclusive
[00:49:21.820 --> 00:49:22.820]   games.
[00:49:22.820 --> 00:49:23.820]   Yeah.
[00:49:23.820 --> 00:49:26.340]   Is that how we're going to determine a winner in the music streaming music?
[00:49:26.340 --> 00:49:28.180]   Until title runs out of money anyway.
[00:49:28.180 --> 00:49:29.500]   That's to me the real problem.
[00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:33.260]   Ultimately, I've mentioned this before is the record industry decides who survives and
[00:49:33.260 --> 00:49:36.420]   who doesn't because they just squeeze.
[00:49:36.420 --> 00:49:40.660]   And the, I believe that streaming music services will survive will be ones that are affiliated
[00:49:40.660 --> 00:49:48.300]   with large companies like Amazon, Google and Apple because they don't have to make money.
[00:49:48.300 --> 00:49:52.740]   They're, they're, they're add-ons for companies that make money in other ways as well.
[00:49:52.740 --> 00:49:56.180]   And independents like these are entitled and even Spotify, I think you're going to
[00:49:56.180 --> 00:49:58.140]   struggle Pandora's struggling.
[00:49:58.140 --> 00:50:02.020]   Pandora says they're launching a streaming music service as if that's going to somehow
[00:50:02.020 --> 00:50:03.580]   save them.
[00:50:03.580 --> 00:50:04.580]   Yeah.
[00:50:04.580 --> 00:50:08.380]   That was the, I heart, no, sorry.
[00:50:08.380 --> 00:50:10.180]   Well, I heard another one.
[00:50:10.180 --> 00:50:11.180]   Yeah.
[00:50:11.180 --> 00:50:13.300]   And I heart will succeed because they're tied to radio.
[00:50:13.300 --> 00:50:14.300]   Yeah.
[00:50:14.300 --> 00:50:18.460]   And so every, you know, that's really, that's clear channel and a disclaimer.
[00:50:18.460 --> 00:50:20.780]   I work for them during the weekend.
[00:50:20.780 --> 00:50:22.660]   I do a radio show there.
[00:50:22.660 --> 00:50:27.100]   I think they'll survive again because they, hey, the record industry is not going to put
[00:50:27.100 --> 00:50:28.100]   them out of business.
[00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:29.100]   Yeah.
[00:50:29.100 --> 00:50:32.780]   And I think ultimately the record industry is going to decide, decide who survives and
[00:50:32.780 --> 00:50:34.300]   who doesn't.
[00:50:34.300 --> 00:50:36.700]   Which is a sad state of affairs.
[00:50:36.700 --> 00:50:38.100]   Mm hmm.
[00:50:38.100 --> 00:50:43.820]   Drake big, like views is like, do you think that's going to drive as much traffic?
[00:50:43.820 --> 00:50:45.060]   Views from, views from the six.
[00:50:45.060 --> 00:50:46.060]   Yeah.
[00:50:46.060 --> 00:50:48.260]   Well, it's done incredibly well in terms of sales.
[00:50:48.260 --> 00:50:50.460]   I don't know if they have any initial numbers out.
[00:50:50.460 --> 00:50:56.740]   But of course this is, I guess his little tiny triumph because of course, Hotline bling
[00:50:56.740 --> 00:51:04.420]   got totally screwed by billboard charts because they did release it as an official Apple
[00:51:04.420 --> 00:51:05.420]   exclusive.
[00:51:05.420 --> 00:51:06.760]   He put his video on there.
[00:51:06.760 --> 00:51:07.760]   Everybody was streaming it.
[00:51:07.760 --> 00:51:13.020]   But the problem is that billboard doesn't count streaming from Apple or Apple music.
[00:51:13.020 --> 00:51:17.860]   So as a result, he ended up missing out on the week that he was supposed to get his first
[00:51:17.860 --> 00:51:19.740]   number one hit on billboard.
[00:51:19.740 --> 00:51:24.900]   And then the next week Adele came out with her new album and he just got totally owned.
[00:51:24.900 --> 00:51:29.460]   So maybe this, maybe this is the week for Drake.
[00:51:29.460 --> 00:51:31.380]   It should be good fodder for his next record.
[00:51:31.380 --> 00:51:32.380]   Yeah, right.
[00:51:32.380 --> 00:51:34.300]   You got to suffer to be an artist, don't you know?
[00:51:34.300 --> 00:51:35.300]   Yeah.
[00:51:35.300 --> 00:51:36.300]   Beyonce was suffering.
[00:51:36.300 --> 00:51:38.140]   Man, don't get in the way with her in a baseball bat.
[00:51:38.140 --> 00:51:39.140]   We learned.
[00:51:39.140 --> 00:51:41.020]   Holy cow.
[00:51:41.020 --> 00:51:44.940]   I was watching with my wife and it made me very uncomfortable because it's of course
[00:51:44.940 --> 00:51:48.940]   about infidelity and about JZ stepping out on Beyonce.
[00:51:48.940 --> 00:51:54.340]   And as a result, she burns the entire back lot at MGM to the ground.
[00:51:54.340 --> 00:51:57.300]   Yeah, it's interesting.
[00:51:57.300 --> 00:52:02.460]   My wife's looking at me going, I have a baseball bat.
[00:52:02.460 --> 00:52:05.540]   Just keep that in mind there.
[00:52:05.540 --> 00:52:07.980]   I think a lot of husbands probably were a little uncomfortable by a lot of them made
[00:52:07.980 --> 00:52:09.220]   uncomfortable by lemonade.
[00:52:09.220 --> 00:52:10.220]   No?
[00:52:10.220 --> 00:52:11.900]   I don't know why I'm asking you, Lauren.
[00:52:11.900 --> 00:52:12.900]   Yeah.
[00:52:12.900 --> 00:52:13.900]   Well, okay.
[00:52:13.900 --> 00:52:14.900]   As a woman.
[00:52:14.900 --> 00:52:15.900]   As a woman.
[00:52:15.900 --> 00:52:16.900]   As a token.
[00:52:16.900 --> 00:52:17.900]   As a woman.
[00:52:17.900 --> 00:52:18.900]   As a woman.
[00:52:18.900 --> 00:52:19.900]   As a confirmed woman.
[00:52:19.900 --> 00:52:20.900]   Yeah.
[00:52:20.900 --> 00:52:26.340]   I think that the big thing of course is the fact that Beyonce is a public figure and a
[00:52:26.340 --> 00:52:30.660]   powerful public figure and her husband is powerful and to some extent her father was
[00:52:30.660 --> 00:52:31.660]   powerful.
[00:52:31.660 --> 00:52:32.660]   Right.
[00:52:32.660 --> 00:52:33.660]   As her former manager.
[00:52:33.660 --> 00:52:34.660]   She talks a lot about her father in lemonade.
[00:52:34.660 --> 00:52:35.660]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:52:35.660 --> 00:52:36.660]   Yes.
[00:52:36.660 --> 00:52:37.660]   Well, he is also his infidelity.
[00:52:37.660 --> 00:52:39.620]   He put Destiny's child together.
[00:52:39.620 --> 00:52:40.620]   Yeah.
[00:52:40.620 --> 00:52:45.300]   And his infidelity was the reason why she ultimately separated from him as a manager.
[00:52:45.300 --> 00:52:50.980]   So the idea that she can basically go to them and say, "Hey, so I'm going to make
[00:52:50.980 --> 00:52:55.740]   a whole record about you and I'm going to talk about it and you can participate if you
[00:52:55.740 --> 00:52:57.260]   want, but otherwise I'm cool."
[00:52:57.260 --> 00:52:59.100]   And I'll give you the exclusive.
[00:52:59.100 --> 00:53:00.260]   So that's okay, right?
[00:53:00.260 --> 00:53:01.260]   Yeah.
[00:53:01.260 --> 00:53:05.660]   Everybody, everybody at your streaming music company will know how much of a dog you like.
[00:53:05.660 --> 00:53:06.660]   Oh, man.
[00:53:06.660 --> 00:53:07.660]   Wow.
[00:53:07.660 --> 00:53:08.660]   But it's intensely personal.
[00:53:08.660 --> 00:53:09.660]   I have to say it's great.
[00:53:09.660 --> 00:53:11.660]   I'm not sure about the music.
[00:53:11.660 --> 00:53:12.660]   It's different.
[00:53:12.660 --> 00:53:13.660]   It's a great video.
[00:53:13.660 --> 00:53:14.660]   I'm not sure how the album.
[00:53:14.660 --> 00:53:15.660]   I'm not sure how the album is.
[00:53:15.660 --> 00:53:16.660]   I'm not sure how the album is.
[00:53:16.660 --> 00:53:17.660]   I'm not sure how the album is.
[00:53:17.660 --> 00:53:18.660]   I'm not sure how the album is.
[00:53:18.660 --> 00:53:19.660]   I'm not sure how the album is.
[00:53:19.660 --> 00:53:20.660]   I'm not sure how the album is.
[00:53:20.660 --> 00:53:21.660]   I'm not sure how the album is.
[00:53:21.660 --> 00:53:22.660]   I'm not sure how the album is.
[00:53:22.660 --> 00:53:23.660]   I'm not sure how the album is.
[00:53:23.660 --> 00:53:24.660]   I'm not sure how the album is.
[00:53:24.660 --> 00:53:25.660]   I'm not sure how the album is.
[00:53:25.660 --> 00:53:26.660]   I'm not sure how the album is.
[00:53:26.660 --> 00:53:27.660]   I'm not sure how the album is.
[00:53:27.660 --> 00:53:28.660]   I'm not sure how the album is.
[00:53:28.660 --> 00:53:29.660]   I'm not sure how the album is.
[00:53:29.660 --> 00:53:30.660]   I'm not sure how the album is.
[00:53:30.660 --> 00:53:31.660]   I'm not sure how the album is.
[00:53:31.660 --> 00:53:32.660]   I'm not sure how the album is.
[00:53:32.660 --> 00:53:33.660]   I'm not sure how the album is.
[00:53:33.660 --> 00:53:34.660]   I'm not sure how the album is.
[00:53:34.660 --> 00:53:35.660]   I'm not sure how the album is.
[00:53:35.660 --> 00:53:36.660]   I'm not sure how the album is.
[00:53:36.660 --> 00:53:37.660]   I'm not sure how the album is.
[00:53:37.660 --> 00:53:38.660]   I'm not sure how the album is.

[01:02:22.660 --> 01:02:23.660]   Lots more to talk about.
[01:02:23.660 --> 01:02:27.660]   Devindra Harder Wars here from Engadget, Lauren Hockinson.
[01:02:27.660 --> 01:02:30.660]   Last time you were here you were with some other company.
[01:02:30.660 --> 01:02:32.660]   That's what the next web.
[01:02:32.660 --> 01:02:33.660]   That's it.
[01:02:33.660 --> 01:02:34.660]   The next web.
[01:02:34.660 --> 01:02:35.660]   You've parted company with it.
[01:02:35.660 --> 01:02:36.660]   No longer worth it.
[01:02:36.660 --> 01:02:38.660]   Do you want to keep doing that kind of thing?
[01:02:38.660 --> 01:02:39.660]   Are you looking for work?
[01:02:39.660 --> 01:02:42.660]   Should we help put out a little ad here?
[01:02:42.660 --> 01:02:43.660]   Oh, thank you.
[01:02:43.660 --> 01:02:44.660]   I'm very flattered.
[01:02:44.660 --> 01:02:46.660]   I got something in the works.
[01:02:46.660 --> 01:02:49.660]   You don't need a job.
[01:02:49.660 --> 01:02:50.660]   I'm good.
[01:02:50.660 --> 01:02:53.660]   This is post lemonade America that we're living in.
[01:02:53.660 --> 01:02:54.660]   I know.
[01:02:54.660 --> 01:02:55.660]   I can do whatever she wants.
[01:02:55.660 --> 01:02:56.660]   A woman can do.
[01:02:56.660 --> 01:02:57.660]   They keep saying that.
[01:02:57.660 --> 01:02:59.660]   Some day it'll be true.
[01:02:59.660 --> 01:03:01.660]   A woman can do anything she wants.
[01:03:01.660 --> 01:03:02.660]   Dang it.
[01:03:02.660 --> 01:03:03.660]   Dang it.
[01:03:03.660 --> 01:03:04.660]   Right.
[01:03:04.660 --> 01:03:06.660]   Keep the baseball bat away from her.
[01:03:06.660 --> 01:03:09.660]   Also here Sam Mascavitch.
[01:03:09.660 --> 01:03:15.660]   Can someone please super cut?
[01:03:15.660 --> 01:03:22.660]   I'm not sure.
[01:03:22.660 --> 01:03:23.660]   I'm delighted.
[01:03:23.660 --> 01:03:25.660]   I love you.
[01:03:25.660 --> 01:03:26.660]   I love you.
[01:03:26.660 --> 01:03:38.060]   What's your PETA
[01:03:38.060 --> 01:03:48.060]   and what's your PETA?
[01:03:48.060 --> 01:03:53.060]   What about that Chobani?
[01:03:53.060 --> 01:03:57.060]   The guy gave stock to the entire company.
[01:03:57.060 --> 01:04:00.060]   Like made millionaires at it.
[01:04:00.060 --> 01:04:10.060]   I'm not sure.
[01:04:10.060 --> 01:04:17.060]   I'm not sure.
[01:04:17.060 --> 01:04:19.060]   I'm giving you all yogurt.
[01:04:19.060 --> 01:04:20.060]   That's right.
[01:04:20.060 --> 01:04:21.060]   You get yogurt already.
[01:04:21.060 --> 01:04:22.060]   Free yogurt.
[01:04:22.060 --> 01:04:23.060]   You get yogurt.
[01:04:23.060 --> 01:04:27.060]   Everybody wants yogurt.
[01:04:27.060 --> 01:04:34.060]   I don't want yogurt from under my seat.
[01:04:34.060 --> 01:04:39.060]   What was the show where there was a wedding and they were going to have doves, release
[01:04:39.060 --> 01:04:44.060]   doves and they said everybody should look under their seat because we've put doves in
[01:04:44.060 --> 01:04:46.060]   an envelope or butterflies.
[01:04:46.060 --> 01:04:50.060]   It was butterflies, butterflies in an envelope to release and then they realized we didn't
[01:04:50.060 --> 01:04:51.060]   put them under the seats.
[01:04:51.060 --> 01:04:54.060]   We put them on the chairs and everybody squished their butterfly.
[01:04:54.060 --> 01:04:57.060]   Am I dreaming to that actually?
[01:04:57.060 --> 01:04:58.060]   That's a good idea.
[01:04:58.060 --> 01:05:00.060]   I think it was a sitcom.
[01:05:00.060 --> 01:05:03.060]   Leo, you're having an acid flatter.
[01:05:03.060 --> 01:05:04.060]   What else you got?
[01:05:04.060 --> 01:05:05.060]   What's going on?
[01:05:05.060 --> 01:05:06.060]   It happened.
[01:05:06.060 --> 01:05:07.060]   It happened, really.
[01:05:07.060 --> 01:05:08.060]   That episode of Match where everyone died.
[01:05:08.060 --> 01:05:11.060]   Yeah, they all died.
[01:05:11.060 --> 01:05:13.060]   Our show today brought to you by Fresh Books Ladies and Gentlemen.
[01:05:13.060 --> 01:05:19.060]   If you are a free lancer or you do your own invoices, you know that that's not the reason
[01:05:19.060 --> 01:05:20.060]   you got in business.
[01:05:20.060 --> 01:05:21.060]   I didn't get in business to do my books.
[01:05:21.060 --> 01:05:25.660]   No, unless your business is accounting and then you're doing somebody else's books.
[01:05:25.660 --> 01:05:30.180]   I bet you even people who have accounting businesses hate doing invoices.
[01:05:30.180 --> 01:05:35.580]   No one likes doing invoices, but I found out something about invoices.
[01:05:35.580 --> 01:05:39.060]   When I was doing it, if you don't send them out, you do not get paid.
[01:05:39.060 --> 01:05:41.420]   This is not a good situation.
[01:05:41.420 --> 01:05:43.620]   So let's really face it.
[01:05:43.620 --> 01:05:48.740]   If you focused on what you're doing, what you love, and I was, you also have to do the
[01:05:48.740 --> 01:05:49.740]   bills at the end of the month.
[01:05:49.740 --> 01:05:51.220]   You got to send them out.
[01:05:51.220 --> 01:05:52.660]   That's when Fresh Books came along.
[01:05:52.660 --> 01:05:53.660]   I was so happy.
[01:05:53.660 --> 01:05:58.340]   This is back in 2004 when I was going to Toronto every month for a week to do shows.
[01:05:58.340 --> 01:06:02.980]   I kept putting off invoicing them, which meant I didn't get reimbursed for my expenses.
[01:06:02.980 --> 01:06:04.180]   I didn't get paid.
[01:06:04.180 --> 01:06:07.100]   Well, it had to be in Canadian dollars.
[01:06:07.100 --> 01:06:09.220]   I had to do the conversion, which is the pain.
[01:06:09.220 --> 01:06:12.620]   Then I found Fresh Books and I loved it, saved my life.
[01:06:12.620 --> 01:06:15.540]   It made it easy to send invoices.
[01:06:15.540 --> 01:06:19.980]   Even looking good invoices that actually get you paid faster because on every email invoices,
[01:06:19.980 --> 01:06:22.500]   a button that says, "Here, pay Leo right now."
[01:06:22.500 --> 01:06:23.500]   You know what?
[01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:26.420]   It turns out your clients don't like paying the bills anymore than you like sending them
[01:06:26.420 --> 01:06:27.420]   out.
[01:06:27.420 --> 01:06:28.420]   So make it easy for them.
[01:06:28.420 --> 01:06:29.420]   You get paid.
[01:06:29.420 --> 01:06:32.060]   On average, five days faster.
[01:06:32.060 --> 01:06:33.700]   That makes a big difference.
[01:06:33.700 --> 01:06:35.580]   They also have some new features that they didn't have.
[01:06:35.580 --> 01:06:36.580]   I would have loved this.
[01:06:36.580 --> 01:06:38.820]   For instance, Project Deposits.
[01:06:38.820 --> 01:06:41.620]   You can invoice for a payment upfront while you're kicking off a project.
[01:06:41.620 --> 01:06:45.340]   That way it doesn't come out of your pocket and you have to wait for reimbursement.
[01:06:45.340 --> 01:06:47.220]   You get lots of information.
[01:06:47.220 --> 01:06:48.220]   The reports are great.
[01:06:48.220 --> 01:06:52.020]   Your accountant will love that when tax time comes along.
[01:06:52.020 --> 01:06:55.060]   You can even see whether or not an accountant has even looked at the invoice.
[01:06:55.060 --> 01:06:56.220]   You email them a loan paid.
[01:06:56.220 --> 01:07:01.140]   If they haven't paid, they handle this automatically with these nice little polite reminders that
[01:07:01.140 --> 01:07:02.380]   get less polite over time.
[01:07:02.380 --> 01:07:03.900]   They make sure you get paid.
[01:07:03.900 --> 01:07:06.020]   It's just a part of what Fresh Books can do.
[01:07:06.020 --> 01:07:11.140]   If you work in people's homes, you can use the Fresh Books app on your iPhone to present
[01:07:11.140 --> 01:07:13.780]   them with an estimate, present them with the invoice.
[01:07:13.780 --> 01:07:18.700]   They even have an EMV chip card enabled reader that you pop in there and you get paid before
[01:07:18.700 --> 01:07:19.700]   you leave.
[01:07:19.700 --> 01:07:21.900]   Stuff like that is awesome.
[01:07:21.900 --> 01:07:22.900]   Fresh Books.

[01:07:48.700 --> 01:07:52.340]   One thing on Twitter, Michael O'Donnell is posting great pictures on Twitter.
[01:07:52.340 --> 01:07:53.700]   Thank you, Michael.
[01:07:53.700 --> 01:07:56.260]   Michael has become the Silicon Valley photographer.
[01:07:56.260 --> 01:07:57.260]   Has any everywhere?
[01:07:57.260 --> 01:07:58.260]   Hey, Michael.
[01:07:58.260 --> 01:07:59.260]   Everywhere.
[01:07:59.260 --> 01:08:00.260]   D'Vinder says hi.
[01:08:00.260 --> 01:08:01.260]   Yeah.
[01:08:01.260 --> 01:08:02.260]   Great.
[01:08:02.260 --> 01:08:03.260]   I love this and he's doing it.
[01:08:03.260 --> 01:08:04.260]   What are you doing?
[01:08:04.260 --> 01:08:05.260]   Photoshop while you're shooting?
[01:08:05.260 --> 01:08:06.500]   How are you doing that?
[01:08:06.500 --> 01:08:08.060]   You do that on the camera?
[01:08:08.060 --> 01:08:09.060]   Wow.
[01:08:09.060 --> 01:08:13.380]   I'm a magic camera or else Lauren Hockinson has a magic fingers.
[01:08:13.380 --> 01:08:16.140]   Michael also has the best Twitter account, speaking of Twitter.
[01:08:16.140 --> 01:08:17.900]   Yeah, follow him on Twitter.
[01:08:17.900 --> 01:08:18.900]   That's awesome.
[01:08:18.900 --> 01:08:19.900]   He's an @vocal.
[01:08:19.900 --> 01:08:20.900]   Yep.
[01:08:20.900 --> 01:08:21.900]   What is it?
[01:08:21.900 --> 01:08:22.900]   @photo.
[01:08:22.900 --> 01:08:23.900]   How'd you get that?
[01:08:23.900 --> 01:08:24.900]   That's insane.
[01:08:24.900 --> 01:08:25.900]   Did you have to...
[01:08:25.900 --> 01:08:27.260]   You got it before they launched.
[01:08:27.260 --> 01:08:29.980]   In 2006, 2006, you got it.
[01:08:29.980 --> 01:08:30.980]   Wow.
[01:08:30.980 --> 01:08:31.980]   Nice.
[01:08:31.980 --> 01:08:34.660]   Ah, Apple Watch.
[01:08:34.660 --> 01:08:36.260]   One year in.
[01:08:36.260 --> 01:08:38.060]   What is our decision?
[01:08:38.060 --> 01:08:40.540]   You actually are quoted to Vindra in this and gadget roundup.
[01:08:40.540 --> 01:08:43.940]   They went to all the editors, Matt and Edger and Chris.
[01:08:43.940 --> 01:08:46.020]   Well, those are the best who have the Apple Watch, basically.
[01:08:46.020 --> 01:08:47.020]   So not everyone.
[01:08:47.020 --> 01:08:48.020]   Not everybody.
[01:08:48.020 --> 01:08:53.340]   I agree, by the way, I agree totally with your take on it, to Vindra.
[01:08:53.340 --> 01:08:56.900]   You said the best thing I can say about the Apple Watch is I still wear it, but I wouldn't
[01:08:56.900 --> 01:08:59.940]   necessarily recommend it.
[01:08:59.940 --> 01:09:03.420]   But if it's one of those things that you get something...
[01:09:03.420 --> 01:09:04.420]   I've always said this.
[01:09:04.420 --> 01:09:07.100]   I don't feel like it's changed the world.
[01:09:07.100 --> 01:09:10.580]   But I see enough people still wearing them, not me.
[01:09:10.580 --> 01:09:11.580]   But enough people...
[01:09:11.580 --> 01:09:13.220]   You say, "I still can't recommend the Apple Watch.
[01:09:13.220 --> 01:09:16.700]   It's a device for a particular lifestyle of digital addiction.
[01:09:16.700 --> 01:09:19.700]   By its very nature and price is not just for everyone."
[01:09:19.700 --> 01:09:22.140]   But it's not an outright failure.
[01:09:22.140 --> 01:09:23.940]   They've sold a ton of them.
[01:09:23.940 --> 01:09:24.940]   They sold a bunch.
[01:09:24.940 --> 01:09:30.060]   I think the fact that they've sold more than the iPhone did in its first year, that's interesting,
[01:09:30.060 --> 01:09:33.460]   especially because the Apple Watch, this is a device for a limited market.
[01:09:33.460 --> 01:09:35.020]   It's only for people who have iPhones.
[01:09:35.020 --> 01:09:36.020]   I agree.
[01:09:36.020 --> 01:09:37.020]   Yeah.
[01:09:37.020 --> 01:09:41.500]   And even a subset of that market, it's not everybody who has an iPhone would love an Apple
[01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:42.500]   Watch.
[01:09:42.500 --> 01:09:43.500]   Exactly.
[01:09:43.500 --> 01:09:48.940]   For a new device that's targeted at such a subset of users to sell that much, I don't
[01:09:48.940 --> 01:09:53.340]   think it's a failure, but I do think everyone is right to complain that it's not as useful
[01:09:53.340 --> 01:09:54.340]   as it could be.
[01:09:54.340 --> 01:09:57.660]   Because there are a lot of things they could do to make the next version better.
[01:09:57.660 --> 01:09:59.340]   I just really like it.
[01:09:59.340 --> 01:10:01.900]   It's my lifeline during the workday because it's great.
[01:10:01.900 --> 01:10:02.900]   I'm on the subway.
[01:10:02.900 --> 01:10:03.900]   I can see updates.
[01:10:03.900 --> 01:10:07.820]   I can see a lot of things without pulling my phone out of my pocket.
[01:10:07.820 --> 01:10:12.220]   But yeah, I'm a very weird edge case for computer usage.
[01:10:12.220 --> 01:10:19.500]   Apple does not reveal sales, but people have figured out with clever slice, actual deliveries
[01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:21.940]   and stuff that they've sold around 12 million.
[01:10:21.940 --> 01:10:26.540]   But what's really interesting, they have more than half of the wearables market share.
[01:10:26.540 --> 01:10:28.060]   Now that's gone down.
[01:10:28.060 --> 01:10:33.700]   They finished Q1 according to strategy analytics with a 52.4% market share down from 63.5%
[01:10:33.700 --> 01:10:35.780]   to 63% last quarter.
[01:10:35.780 --> 01:10:39.180]   It's not surprising that they can get up on the wearable market share.
[01:10:39.180 --> 01:10:43.460]   When the wearable share, as the vendor just said, is sort of an edge case.
[01:10:43.460 --> 01:10:48.220]   It hasn't been this leading thing where people have been just going out in droves to get smartwatches.
[01:10:48.220 --> 01:10:49.460]   I see a lot of phone.
[01:10:49.460 --> 01:10:50.940]   Fitbits though, right?
[01:10:50.940 --> 01:10:51.940]   Absolutely.
[01:10:51.940 --> 01:10:54.100]   Fitbits are the perfect price spot.
[01:10:54.100 --> 01:10:58.580]   Apple really wanted to, it's kind of funny that Microsoft thought they might have a good
[01:10:58.580 --> 01:11:02.940]   idea by releasing their own fitness band, but they completely balded on the fact that
[01:11:02.940 --> 01:11:03.940]   it's the price.
[01:11:03.940 --> 01:11:04.940]   Stupid.
[01:11:04.940 --> 01:11:09.100]   If they could have gotten that down to $100 and have it really limited and then have some
[01:11:09.100 --> 01:11:12.660]   step ups, I mean gosh, this is the company that made like five different versions of
[01:11:12.660 --> 01:11:13.660]   the Xbox.
[01:11:13.660 --> 01:11:15.460]   You think they could have done the same thing with the band.
[01:11:15.460 --> 01:11:16.460]   But they didn't really have that.
[01:11:16.460 --> 01:11:18.700]   They had the same issue with the band as they did with the phone, right?
[01:11:18.700 --> 01:11:22.900]   It was several years too late and it was too expensive and nobody needed that from Microsoft
[01:11:22.900 --> 01:11:23.900]   at that point.
[01:11:23.900 --> 01:11:27.060]   Even though it's a good product, but if you just don't have an entry way to it, you're
[01:11:27.060 --> 01:11:28.860]   not going to beat Fitbit.
[01:11:28.860 --> 01:11:34.020]   You're not going to beat that $99 thing that combines your watch and some very basic tracking
[01:11:34.020 --> 01:11:37.580]   and then hooks you into wanting to get, "Oh, well, I'm going to need the heart rate monitors.
[01:11:37.580 --> 01:11:41.540]   I'll go in and get the $141 next year and all that sort of thing."
[01:11:41.540 --> 01:11:45.260]   I actually wear Fitbit Blaze and I love it.
[01:11:45.260 --> 01:11:46.420]   That's too little bucks though.
[01:11:46.420 --> 01:11:47.420]   That's getting in your first fit.
[01:11:47.420 --> 01:11:48.420]   No far from it.
[01:11:48.420 --> 01:11:49.420]   I got the Fit.
[01:11:49.420 --> 01:11:50.420]   Exactly.
[01:11:50.420 --> 01:11:51.420]   That's like my eighth Fitbit.
[01:11:51.420 --> 01:11:52.420]   Yeah.
[01:11:52.420 --> 01:11:56.100]   They get you one like, "Oh, well goodness, that heart rate monitor is going to make my
[01:11:56.100 --> 01:11:59.980]   sleep tracking that much more intense and specific and blah, blah, blah."
[01:11:59.980 --> 01:12:03.900]   Well, in five day battery life and because they have such good battery life, the Blaze
[01:12:03.900 --> 01:12:07.940]   monitors my heart rate all the time, not just when I say monitor it.
[01:12:07.940 --> 01:12:11.500]   So I know what my resting heart rate was, which the WAPA watch never was able to tell
[01:12:11.500 --> 01:12:12.500]   me.
[01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:13.500]   It gives me some notifications.
[01:12:13.500 --> 01:12:16.740]   Have you ever considered putting biometric feedback on the show?
[01:12:16.740 --> 01:12:20.340]   Have you ever seen this where people on YouTube will do tasks and then have the heart rate
[01:12:20.340 --> 01:12:21.340]   at the bottom?
[01:12:21.340 --> 01:12:22.340]   Oh, dude.
[01:12:22.340 --> 01:12:23.340]   We did that 10 years ago.
[01:12:23.340 --> 01:12:28.260]   I was a shirt that measured my EKG while I was doing the screen savers in 2000.
[01:12:28.260 --> 01:12:31.420]   Leo, I like to think you always wear a special shirt.
[01:12:31.420 --> 01:12:36.860]   I have a special even censored shirt that contacts my physician any time I go into fibrillation.
[01:12:36.860 --> 01:12:38.860]   Very good.
[01:12:38.860 --> 01:12:39.860]   No, no, but yeah.
[01:12:39.860 --> 01:12:46.340]   Actually, in some ways, it's really interesting that this whole quantified self-movement got
[01:12:46.340 --> 01:12:48.580]   so much attention and really does so little.
[01:12:48.580 --> 01:12:56.060]   It really at best, a pedometer plus heart rate monitor, which we've had for decades.
[01:12:56.060 --> 01:12:58.300]   And the heart rate monitor isn't even super necessary, right?
[01:12:58.300 --> 01:13:01.620]   A lot of people just want the step counting and that's pretty much it.
[01:13:01.620 --> 01:13:03.540]   It may be some sort of tracking.
[01:13:03.540 --> 01:13:08.500]   For a five buck device you put on your belt buckle, you could have to step tracking.
[01:13:08.500 --> 01:13:11.060]   I don't know what it is about this category.
[01:13:11.060 --> 01:13:14.980]   It's maybe VR is going to be kind of like this too, which had immense promise and everybody
[01:13:14.980 --> 01:13:19.740]   got excited about it, but it just doesn't make any progress.
[01:13:19.740 --> 01:13:22.780]   I think that VR is coming from a different angle though.
[01:13:22.780 --> 01:13:27.060]   I mean, okay, if you think about it, this sounds very weird, but I like to think of
[01:13:27.060 --> 01:13:31.260]   the quantified self-movement a little bit like Pinterest, which is not only grabbed
[01:13:31.260 --> 01:13:37.660]   early adopters, but it's grabbed like this segment of women, like 30s in the Midwest
[01:13:37.660 --> 01:13:42.380]   who just love tracking sleep or they're using it as their step counter to get through the
[01:13:42.380 --> 01:13:49.300]   day, like my mom doesn't care about VR, but she loves talking about her Fitbit and she
[01:13:49.300 --> 01:13:54.540]   loves like plugging it in and like looking at her data and feeling fancy about herself.
[01:13:54.540 --> 01:13:57.660]   And I think that that's like really important.
[01:13:57.660 --> 01:14:02.460]   It's really attracted this like segment of people that normally don't hop on to tech
[01:14:02.460 --> 01:14:04.460]   trends in quite the same way.
[01:14:04.460 --> 01:14:08.340]   And I think that that's the really important and signifying piece of the Fitbit.
[01:14:08.340 --> 01:14:10.460]   That said, I don't own a Fitbit.
[01:14:10.460 --> 01:14:13.060]   And I received an Apple watch as a very thoughtful gift.
[01:14:13.060 --> 01:14:14.060]   You wear it?
[01:14:14.060 --> 01:14:15.060]   I'm not wearing it today.
[01:14:15.060 --> 01:14:16.540]   But you do wear it.
[01:14:16.540 --> 01:14:21.260]   Yeah, yeah, I try to wear it usually on weekdays when I know that my wrist isn't going to
[01:14:21.260 --> 01:14:24.940]   be really sweaty, which it's not good.
[01:14:24.940 --> 01:14:28.860]   What I'm going to say about the quantified self-movement is that having the phone changes
[01:14:28.860 --> 01:14:29.860]   everything.
[01:14:29.860 --> 01:14:34.700]   We as Supergeeks are very likely to get some sort of crazy body tracking device and then
[01:14:34.700 --> 01:14:39.940]   run to our computers, install all the drivers, get all the software, deal with all the quirks
[01:14:39.940 --> 01:14:43.700]   of how the crappy interface shows everything with a phone.
[01:14:43.700 --> 01:14:45.460]   Boom, you've just got a little bit of Bluetooth.
[01:14:45.460 --> 01:14:49.980]   And that's kind of the secret for getting that penetration, which is sort of what I think
[01:14:49.980 --> 01:14:56.060]   Apple thought would happen with the watch that you have this life assistant device that
[01:14:56.060 --> 01:14:57.460]   you're always using.
[01:14:57.460 --> 01:15:00.660]   The watch is going to play so nicely with that.
[01:15:00.660 --> 01:15:05.540]   And when that price comes down, when they can get the watch to see or whatever, put the
[01:15:05.540 --> 01:15:09.660]   letter C in there and make it a cheap one and make it really limited, but still sort
[01:15:09.660 --> 01:15:11.580]   of hook in and look cute.
[01:15:11.580 --> 01:15:15.740]   I think that's going to be the beginning because once you really factor in, oh, I have this
[01:15:15.740 --> 01:15:21.140]   assistant sort of thing that really plays well with the thing that I could not live without,
[01:15:21.140 --> 01:15:22.940]   then that's what starts driving.
[01:15:22.940 --> 01:15:26.620]   So it's not that the Apple watch certainly isn't a failure and it has room to grow.
[01:15:26.620 --> 01:15:30.220]   And I think it was Apple was in a really interesting position when they launched it, which is
[01:15:30.220 --> 01:15:32.300]   that, hey, remember our first iPod?
[01:15:32.300 --> 01:15:33.300]   Got way better.
[01:15:33.300 --> 01:15:34.700]   Hey, remember our first iPhone?
[01:15:34.700 --> 01:15:35.780]   Got way better.
[01:15:35.780 --> 01:15:39.860]   And that meant that people who bought into it weren't going to go, gosh, I need to wait.
[01:15:39.860 --> 01:15:40.860]   They go, you know what?
[01:15:40.860 --> 01:15:41.860]   I'm ready.
[01:15:41.860 --> 01:15:42.860]   I'm ready for that first Apple thing.
[01:15:42.860 --> 01:15:43.980]   It's not going to be garbage.
[01:15:43.980 --> 01:15:45.860]   The next one will be better.
[01:15:45.860 --> 01:15:48.620]   And that's, our technique had its own wish list.
[01:15:48.620 --> 01:15:49.900]   We want some speed.
[01:15:49.900 --> 01:15:54.060]   We want some better wireless connectivity to 5G networks.
[01:15:54.060 --> 01:15:59.060]   There's a wish list there, but it's still the promises there.
[01:15:59.060 --> 01:16:00.140]   The look is pretty good.
[01:16:00.140 --> 01:16:02.220]   The size is not too huge.
[01:16:02.220 --> 01:16:06.660]   It's getting that price down and sweeten those features up and that next edition may really
[01:16:06.660 --> 01:16:11.460]   turn things around at the very least as a cool looking Fitbit like thing that's cheap,
[01:16:11.460 --> 01:16:14.260]   if not, you know, an utter Apple like status symbol.
[01:16:14.260 --> 01:16:15.260]   It remains a lot better.
[01:16:15.260 --> 01:16:16.260]   Right.
[01:16:16.260 --> 01:16:18.260]   How badly is it heard by the fact that you have to have an iPhone?
[01:16:18.260 --> 01:16:19.260]   Does that help?
[01:16:19.260 --> 01:16:20.260]   Pretty bad.
[01:16:20.260 --> 01:16:21.260]   It's limited.
[01:16:21.260 --> 01:16:22.260]   Yeah.
[01:16:22.260 --> 01:16:23.260]   Yeah, it's super limited.
[01:16:23.260 --> 01:16:26.940]   And it's like, it's funny too, because it sounds like the iPod didn't take off until you
[01:16:26.940 --> 01:16:28.460]   could run it on Windows.
[01:16:28.460 --> 01:16:29.460]   Oh, absolutely.
[01:16:29.460 --> 01:16:30.460]   That's right.
[01:16:30.460 --> 01:16:31.460]   Yeah.
[01:16:31.460 --> 01:16:34.620]   Mac users were a huge minority back then too.
[01:16:34.620 --> 01:16:37.620]   Like it was a very different competing environment back in those days.
[01:16:37.620 --> 01:16:41.620]   Well, you know, Apple's still not dominant in, well, I guess the phone is.
[01:16:41.620 --> 01:16:42.620]   Yeah, I own.
[01:16:42.620 --> 01:16:43.620]   Yeah.
[01:16:43.620 --> 01:16:44.620]   There's no West.
[01:16:44.620 --> 01:16:45.620]   Yeah.
[01:16:45.620 --> 01:16:46.620]   Yeah.
[01:16:46.620 --> 01:16:47.620]   Yeah.
[01:16:47.620 --> 01:16:48.620]   Yeah.

[02:00:08.620 --> 02:00:09.620]   Yeah.
[02:00:09.620 --> 02:00:11.620]   I figure if I'm a mess Sam's name, I might as well just ruin your all.
[02:00:11.620 --> 02:00:12.620]   You're going down with me.
[02:00:12.620 --> 02:00:13.620]   You're all going down.
[02:00:13.620 --> 02:00:14.620]   That's thanks by the way to Aussie Geek Girl for providing me with those pseudonyms.
[02:00:14.620 --> 02:00:15.620]   Keep it up.
[02:00:15.620 --> 02:00:16.620]   Keep it up.
[02:00:16.620 --> 02:00:18.620]   We want to continue throughout the rest of the show, which is almost over.
[02:00:18.620 --> 02:00:19.620]   Hey, we had a great week this week.
[02:00:19.620 --> 02:00:21.620]   Did you see what we did this week on Twitter?
[02:00:21.620 --> 02:00:23.620]   We made a little movie to help you enjoy.
[02:00:23.620 --> 02:00:25.620]   Previously on Twitter.
[02:00:25.620 --> 02:00:29.620]   Becky is going to do a little bit of a deep dive on the energy cost of data storage
[02:00:29.620 --> 02:00:30.620]   but let's take a moment to--
[02:00:30.620 --> 02:00:31.620]   Okay, stop.
[02:00:31.620 --> 02:00:33.620]   That is the worst tease I've ever heard.
[02:00:33.620 --> 02:00:37.620]   I'm going to make it the most interesting, hot, awesome discussion of the energy cost of
[02:00:37.620 --> 02:00:38.620]   data storage.
[02:00:38.620 --> 02:00:39.620]   Exactly.
[02:00:39.620 --> 02:00:43.620]   And for both the self-let, Becky write her own teases from now on.
[02:00:43.620 --> 02:00:44.620]   Yes.
[02:00:44.620 --> 02:00:45.620]   Triangulation.
[02:00:45.620 --> 02:00:49.620]   When he left to form Next, Steve had said, "You got to come with me."
[02:00:49.620 --> 02:00:51.620]   I said, "I'm in the middle of this hypercard thing.
[02:00:51.620 --> 02:00:52.620]   I think it's going to be important."
[02:00:52.620 --> 02:00:54.620]   And he said, "Well, if you were really my friend, you'd come with me.
[02:00:54.620 --> 02:00:58.620]   If you were really my friend, you'd want me to be fulfilled and successful at one time."
[02:00:58.620 --> 02:01:01.620]   And he said, "I'm going to be a little bit more successful at what I'm doing."
[02:01:01.620 --> 02:01:02.620]   Windows Weekly.
[02:01:02.620 --> 02:01:03.620]   This is Kate Cci.
[02:01:03.620 --> 02:01:05.620]   I was news leader.
[02:01:05.620 --> 02:01:07.620]   Microsoft recommends upgrading to Windows 10.
[02:01:07.620 --> 02:01:08.620]   What should I do?
[02:01:08.620 --> 02:01:10.620]   Don't you love when that pops up.
[02:01:10.620 --> 02:01:13.620]   The winds have been very gussy overnight as well.
[02:01:13.620 --> 02:01:15.620]   It's the Windows 10, right?
[02:01:15.620 --> 02:01:16.620]   Don't do it.
[02:01:16.620 --> 02:01:17.620]   Wow, Microsoft.
[02:01:17.620 --> 02:01:20.620]   Wow, that's the kind of thing where you just can't buy.
[02:01:20.620 --> 02:01:21.620]   Twit.
[02:01:21.620 --> 02:01:23.620]   Test drive one today.
[02:01:23.620 --> 02:01:24.620]   Look at this.
[02:01:24.620 --> 02:01:25.620]   Dog beer.
[02:01:25.620 --> 02:01:26.620]   Try it.
[02:01:26.620 --> 02:01:27.620]   Yeah, it's Bowser beer.
[02:01:27.620 --> 02:01:28.620]   Oh, yeah.
[02:01:28.620 --> 02:01:29.620]   Oh!
[02:01:29.620 --> 02:01:30.620]   No, it's good.
[02:01:30.620 --> 02:01:32.620]   It's got glucose to me.
[02:01:32.620 --> 02:01:35.620]   It's not bad.
[02:01:35.620 --> 02:01:39.620]   It's a matter with you.
[02:01:39.620 --> 02:01:41.620]   Television smart and sorry.
[02:01:41.620 --> 02:01:43.620]   Elite and drink anything.
[02:01:43.620 --> 02:01:44.620]   It was a good screensaver.
[02:01:44.620 --> 02:01:47.620]   If you haven't seen the new screensavers from yesterday, do watch that.
[02:01:47.620 --> 02:01:48.620]   We got a great week coming up.
[02:01:48.620 --> 02:01:50.620]   Megan Moroni, what's ahead?
[02:01:50.620 --> 02:01:51.620]   Thank you, Leo.
[02:01:51.620 --> 02:01:56.620]   It's the first week in May, my favorite week of the year because it contains May the fourth
[02:01:56.620 --> 02:01:58.620]   be with you day to celebrate.
[02:01:58.620 --> 02:02:02.620]   You can ask her Amazon Echo to tell you a Star Wars joke.
[02:02:02.620 --> 02:02:05.620]   She's got tons and some of them are even funny.
[02:02:05.620 --> 02:02:10.620]   I'm sure there will also be all kinds of other Star Wars news and fun all week.
[02:02:10.620 --> 02:02:15.620]   Also, we will pick through more earnings reports next week to find the gems among the numbers.
[02:02:15.620 --> 02:02:20.620]   Etsy, Zinga, GoDaddy and Match, the folks behind Tinder and other popular dating apps,
[02:02:20.620 --> 02:02:23.620]   will all be releasing earnings next week.
[02:02:23.620 --> 02:02:28.620]   Plus, tickets to MineCon, the Minecraft Convention in Anaheim, go on sale next week.
[02:02:28.620 --> 02:02:33.620]   Also, the IEEE International Symposium on Hardware Oriented Security and Trust happens
[02:02:33.620 --> 02:02:35.620]   this week in McLean, Virginia.
[02:02:35.620 --> 02:02:40.620]   And this week, Uber says it's rolling out a pilot program where riders will get charged
[02:02:40.620 --> 02:02:43.620]   if their drivers have to wait longer than two minutes before them.
[02:02:43.620 --> 02:02:46.620]   So, respect your Uber driver or take lift.
[02:02:46.620 --> 02:02:50.620]   Don't miss tech news today, every day at 4PM Pacific with Jason Howell and myself.
[02:02:50.620 --> 02:02:51.620]   Back to you, Leo.
[02:02:51.620 --> 02:02:52.620]   Hi, I'm Aaronie, TNT.
[02:02:52.620 --> 02:02:57.620]   Monday through Friday, 4PM Pacific, 7PM Eastern, 2300 UTC for your daily dose of tech news.
[02:02:57.620 --> 02:03:02.620]   Could you rewind it when she went back to the, we're getting earnings reports from Etsy,
[02:03:02.620 --> 02:03:03.620]   Zinga?
[02:03:03.620 --> 02:03:11.620]   I feel like if somebody's living, if somebody from like 30 years ago listened to the words
[02:03:11.620 --> 02:03:15.620]   coming out of her mouth today, they would think that they would be baffled.
[02:03:15.620 --> 02:03:19.620]   They would think like, what has happened to the world?
[02:03:19.620 --> 02:03:22.620]   What about that whole spiel you just had about the-
[02:03:22.620 --> 02:03:23.620]   Yeah, the numbers.
[02:03:23.620 --> 02:03:24.620]   Wait a minute, here you-
[02:03:24.620 --> 02:03:28.620]   I see Zinga go daddy and match the folks behind Tinder and other-
[02:03:28.620 --> 02:03:31.620]   See, Etsy, Zinga go daddy match and the folks behind Tinder.
[02:03:31.620 --> 02:03:32.620]   If you heard that like 19-
[02:03:32.620 --> 02:03:35.620]   I would think you were talking about the Lala Palooza lineup tonight.
[02:03:35.620 --> 02:03:37.620]   So, that would be fine for me.
[02:03:37.620 --> 02:03:39.620]   What is this world coming to?
[02:03:39.620 --> 02:03:42.620]   Well, I mean, yeah, but one hour of Martinizing was a thing once.
[02:03:42.620 --> 02:03:43.620]   That's true.
[02:03:43.620 --> 02:03:44.620]   That's true.
[02:03:44.620 --> 02:03:45.620]   What is Martinizing?
[02:03:45.620 --> 02:03:46.620]   What is Martinizing?
[02:03:46.620 --> 02:03:47.620]   I don't know.
[02:03:47.620 --> 02:03:48.620]   No one knows.
[02:03:48.620 --> 02:03:49.620]   No one in an hour.
[02:03:49.620 --> 02:03:50.620]   That's the good news.
[02:03:50.620 --> 02:03:52.620]   Our show today brought to you by Carbonite Online.
[02:03:52.620 --> 02:03:55.620]   Backup, so important to backup regularly.
[02:03:55.620 --> 02:03:57.620]   You know that, but what is a good backup?
[02:03:57.620 --> 02:03:59.620]   Well, I can tell you a few things I look for.
[02:03:59.620 --> 02:04:02.620]   It's got to be automatic, so I don't have to think about it.
[02:04:02.620 --> 02:04:03.620]   Continuous would be nice.
[02:04:03.620 --> 02:04:07.620]   So, if I change a file, I'm writing that great American novel and I add a new character.
[02:04:07.620 --> 02:04:08.620]   I want to have that be backed up.
[02:04:08.620 --> 02:04:11.620]   I don't want to lose that, you know, in a hard drive failure.
[02:04:11.620 --> 02:04:13.620]   And you know what failures happen?
[02:04:13.620 --> 02:04:16.620]   Most importantly, you got to backup off-site.
[02:04:16.620 --> 02:04:21.620]   So, if there is a real disaster, a fire, a flood, or somebody breaks in and steals all
[02:04:21.620 --> 02:04:23.620]   your stuff, your data at least is safe.
[02:04:23.620 --> 02:04:29.780]   You can replace that laptop, but all that work, all those baby pictures and the emails, the
[02:04:29.780 --> 02:04:33.620]   tax records, your great American novel, you don't want to lose that.
[02:04:33.620 --> 02:04:37.700]   I have a friend who's a novelist who, remember about 20 years ago, there was a big fire in
[02:04:37.700 --> 02:04:39.260]   the Oakland Hills, a lot of houses burned.
[02:04:39.260 --> 02:04:40.340]   Her house burned.
[02:04:40.340 --> 02:04:43.900]   Her only copy of her novel, burnt with it.
[02:04:43.900 --> 02:04:45.220]   That doesn't have to happen anymore.
[02:04:45.220 --> 02:04:46.820]   We've got backup and we've got carbonite.
[02:04:46.820 --> 02:04:49.700]   I want you to try it right now.
[02:04:49.700 --> 02:04:51.180]   Go to carbonite.com.
[02:04:51.180 --> 02:04:52.540]   Free trial awaits you.
[02:04:52.540 --> 02:04:56.780]   Use our offer code TWIT and you'll get two free months when you buy.
[02:04:56.780 --> 02:05:00.980]   Home or office, Mac or PC, off-site backup, you don't have to worry about it.
[02:05:00.980 --> 02:05:01.980]   You don't have to think about it.
[02:05:01.980 --> 02:05:03.460]   It's just there.
[02:05:03.460 --> 02:05:07.740]   A million and a half homes, trusts and businesses, trusts to carbonite.
[02:05:07.740 --> 02:05:10.340]   50 billion files restored.
[02:05:10.340 --> 02:05:12.940]   Files that would have been lost forever.
[02:05:12.940 --> 02:05:13.940]   Don't forget.
[02:05:13.940 --> 02:05:16.660]   Go to it two free bonus months if you decide to buy.
[02:05:16.660 --> 02:05:18.260]   That trial does not require credit card.
[02:05:18.260 --> 02:05:20.180]   It's free.
[02:05:20.180 --> 02:05:22.740]   For a limited time, up to 30% off.
[02:05:22.740 --> 02:05:25.820]   This is the time to do it.
[02:05:25.820 --> 02:05:27.660]   Carbonite.com.
[02:05:27.660 --> 02:05:32.140]   Let's see.
[02:05:32.140 --> 02:05:33.140]   Happy stuff.
[02:05:33.140 --> 02:05:35.700]   I want to end on a high note.
[02:05:35.700 --> 02:05:37.820]   There's going to be a new Nintendo console.
[02:05:37.820 --> 02:05:39.500]   Yeah.
[02:05:39.500 --> 02:05:40.500]   That's good news.
[02:05:40.500 --> 02:05:41.500]   Yeah.
[02:05:41.500 --> 02:05:42.500]   It's not over from a Nintendo.
[02:05:42.500 --> 02:05:43.500]   Yes.
[02:05:43.500 --> 02:05:44.500]   It's not over from a Nintendo.
[02:05:44.500 --> 02:05:45.500]   Oh, no.
[02:05:45.500 --> 02:05:47.740]   You picked the wrong topic if you're having me on.
[02:05:47.740 --> 02:05:48.740]   Yeah.
[02:05:48.740 --> 02:05:49.740]   Why?
[02:05:49.740 --> 02:05:50.740]   You're not a Nintendo fan.
[02:05:50.740 --> 02:05:54.580]   Because I've got more P to put on that as well.
[02:05:54.580 --> 02:05:55.580]   Yeah.
[02:05:55.580 --> 02:05:56.580]   It would.
[02:05:56.580 --> 02:06:00.500]   It's a little hard for Nintendo to come back at this point.
[02:06:00.500 --> 02:06:02.660]   Is it going to be an HD device?
[02:06:02.660 --> 02:06:03.660]   We don't know.
[02:06:03.660 --> 02:06:05.660]   I mean, there's a lot of things.
[02:06:05.660 --> 02:06:06.820]   We need Nintendo's whole thing.
[02:06:06.820 --> 02:06:11.500]   Nintendo's whole thing has been, you know, obviously they had the greatest selling console
[02:06:11.500 --> 02:06:15.540]   of all time with the Wii and they're never going to be able to replicate that.
[02:06:15.540 --> 02:06:18.100]   It's nobody's going to be able to replicate that, you know, Xbox.
[02:06:18.100 --> 02:06:21.100]   The Xbox 360 just went out of production development.
[02:06:21.100 --> 02:06:22.100]   Ten years in that.
[02:06:22.100 --> 02:06:23.100]   Yeah.
[02:06:23.100 --> 02:06:24.980]   Huge life cycle and that didn't even get close.
[02:06:24.980 --> 02:06:27.140]   Didn't even get within spinning distance.
[02:06:27.140 --> 02:06:33.180]   And keep in mind also their handhold console business is still super good.
[02:06:33.180 --> 02:06:34.180]   They did the 3DS.
[02:06:34.180 --> 02:06:35.180]   Nintendo's.
[02:06:35.180 --> 02:06:36.180]   3DS still sells well.
[02:06:36.180 --> 02:06:37.180]   It's a perennial seller.
[02:06:37.180 --> 02:06:38.380]   It does a really good job.
[02:06:38.380 --> 02:06:41.420]   Technically, if they wanted to get out of the home console market and just focus on
[02:06:41.420 --> 02:06:43.340]   handhelds and mobile, they could.
[02:06:43.340 --> 02:06:46.260]   And a lot of people suggest that they might and should.
[02:06:46.260 --> 02:06:51.300]   But I think that people were concerned that the new dawn of the Nintendo NX meant that
[02:06:51.300 --> 02:06:55.700]   they were throwing out the Wii U as sort of a mulligan and that it really wasn't where
[02:06:55.700 --> 02:06:56.700]   they were going for.
[02:06:56.700 --> 02:07:00.620]   But at the same time, I think that the Wii U was initially supposed to be a novelty console
[02:07:00.620 --> 02:07:02.420]   device.
[02:07:02.420 --> 02:07:04.420]   And I wouldn't recommend buying one now.
[02:07:04.420 --> 02:07:08.220]   I believe the last time I recommended buying one was right after Black Friday.
[02:07:08.220 --> 02:07:12.860]   You all are of the generation that the group would Nintendo with the Super Nintendo NES
[02:07:12.860 --> 02:07:14.820]   or Mario and all of that stuff.
[02:07:14.820 --> 02:07:18.020]   You know, it really was that's culturally important to you.
[02:07:18.020 --> 02:07:19.020]   Yes.
[02:07:19.020 --> 02:07:21.580]   I'll buy every Nintendo console that ever comes out.
[02:07:21.580 --> 02:07:24.180]   You know, I bought several generations of 3DSs.
[02:07:24.180 --> 02:07:27.900]   Even the first one, which burned me because the price was super high and then they like
[02:07:27.900 --> 02:07:30.500]   slashed it by a hundred bucks.
[02:07:30.500 --> 02:07:33.340]   You're right, Lauren, that their handheld business has been good.
[02:07:33.340 --> 02:07:37.780]   I think for the past year, the 3DS just hasn't done as well as it used to or at least for
[02:07:37.780 --> 02:07:39.180]   their overall business.
[02:07:39.180 --> 02:07:41.980]   So like the NX has a lot to prove for next year.
[02:07:41.980 --> 02:07:43.180]   I actually would be interested.
[02:07:43.180 --> 02:07:47.100]   There were some rumors that it would kind of combine, you know, a home console plus
[02:07:47.100 --> 02:07:48.820]   a handheld type thing.
[02:07:48.820 --> 02:07:50.860]   And I think they were almost there with the Wii U.
[02:07:50.860 --> 02:07:55.580]   You know, the Wii U's controller is a great way to game when you have the TV off or if
[02:07:55.580 --> 02:07:56.780]   somebody else is using your TV.
[02:07:56.780 --> 02:08:00.700]   Now, if that thing were truly portable and like would give you maybe reception all around
[02:08:00.700 --> 02:08:05.540]   the house or you could actually offload games and take it somewhere, that would be great
[02:08:05.540 --> 02:08:08.820]   because Nintendo has such a great library of games and I don't know.
[02:08:08.820 --> 02:08:14.220]   I think that would be a really good evolution of both the Wii and the 3DS type experience.
[02:08:14.220 --> 02:08:17.060]   But Sam Mossiwitz, you did write the...
[02:08:17.060 --> 02:08:18.060]   Mossiwitz.
[02:08:18.060 --> 02:08:21.300]   You did write the article.
[02:08:21.300 --> 02:08:23.300]   I'm sorry.
[02:08:23.300 --> 02:08:25.260]   Came to coming.
[02:08:25.260 --> 02:08:28.180]   Nintendo says March 2017.
[02:08:28.180 --> 02:08:30.380]   I mean, this is an imminent.
[02:08:30.380 --> 02:08:33.420]   That is the very end of their fiscal year.
[02:08:33.420 --> 02:08:37.580]   So it all, it seems like that was chosen very specifically as opposed to a Christmas or
[02:08:37.580 --> 02:08:39.540]   as opposed to an even longer delay.
[02:08:39.540 --> 02:08:42.100]   Yeah, you would want to get this out for Christmas when you know...
[02:08:42.100 --> 02:08:47.100]   They're saying that they don't have enough software and everything they've delayed thus
[02:08:47.100 --> 02:08:51.100]   far is not that like they just released a Star Fox game after delaying it forever.
[02:08:51.100 --> 02:08:53.020]   That was not delayed to make it better.
[02:08:53.020 --> 02:08:55.700]   That tanked on launch with a lot of bad reviews.
[02:08:55.700 --> 02:08:57.300]   The sales are not as great as they do.
[02:08:57.300 --> 02:09:01.020]   Well, and Zelda isn't going to be out for the Wii U.
[02:09:01.020 --> 02:09:02.660]   It's going to be out for the NX.
[02:09:02.660 --> 02:09:03.660]   It's going to be out for both.
[02:09:03.660 --> 02:09:04.660]   They're going to...
[02:09:04.660 --> 02:09:08.460]   They're delaying the launch for the Wii U version and having it come out just sometime
[02:09:08.460 --> 02:09:09.460]   in 2017.
[02:09:09.460 --> 02:09:13.780]   So we don't even know if that's going to launch with the Nintendo NX, which, assuming
[02:09:13.780 --> 02:09:18.140]   that Nintendo's never been the best at holding to these estimates, by the way.
[02:09:18.140 --> 02:09:20.180]   So March 17 is anybody's guess.
[02:09:20.180 --> 02:09:21.980]   Will they show this at E3?
[02:09:21.980 --> 02:09:22.980]   No.
[02:09:22.980 --> 02:09:25.300]   They're not going to show a single bit of the NX at E3.
[02:09:25.300 --> 02:09:26.900]   They made that clear, which was very surprising.
[02:09:26.900 --> 02:09:30.820]   In fact, they're not showing anything except the Zelda game.
[02:09:30.820 --> 02:09:31.820]   That's it.
[02:09:31.820 --> 02:09:36.540]   The presence is going to be very limited, which actually speaks a lot to publishers in general,
[02:09:36.540 --> 02:09:40.140]   sort of, shying away from thinking of E3 as a necessary thing.
[02:09:40.140 --> 02:09:41.700]   Nintendo's been very big in the ass.
[02:09:41.700 --> 02:09:44.500]   So that's more bad news about E3 than it is about E3.
[02:09:44.500 --> 02:09:46.180]   Yeah, that's more bad news about E3.
[02:09:46.180 --> 02:09:51.460]   Nintendo's been very good about controlling its image and its message through YouTube presentations
[02:09:51.460 --> 02:09:56.940]   in which their executives play out as caricatures and themselves and show off games.
[02:09:56.940 --> 02:09:58.500]   Didn't that stand very well?
[02:09:58.500 --> 02:10:00.140]   The Mi-Tomo did well, right?
[02:10:00.140 --> 02:10:01.140]   Yes, it has 10 million.
[02:10:01.140 --> 02:10:04.220]   It is making money.
[02:10:04.220 --> 02:10:05.500]   It's going to keep on making money.
[02:10:05.500 --> 02:10:11.500]   And Nintendo was very clear that it's got two more high-profile franchises coming by
[02:10:11.500 --> 02:10:13.740]   the end by this fall, two smartphones.
[02:10:13.740 --> 02:10:18.220]   That's going to be Fire Emblem, which is like a strategy quest series, and Animal Crossing,
[02:10:18.220 --> 02:10:22.540]   which is what Mi-Tomo should have been, which has a lot more life simulation, a lot more
[02:10:22.540 --> 02:10:27.380]   customization, a lot of the stuff that I think is going to suit very well to smartphone use
[02:10:27.380 --> 02:10:31.420]   in the way that Animal Crossing games did very well on the DS and the 3DS.
[02:10:31.420 --> 02:10:34.980]   So a band in hardware, a band and platform just do iPhone games?
[02:10:34.980 --> 02:10:36.540]   No, I mean, that's going to be, you know what?
[02:10:36.540 --> 02:10:40.620]   Here's the thing, that could happen in our lifetime, which is something I would have never
[02:10:40.620 --> 02:10:45.140]   said, because the big piece of news that got buried in a lot of these reports is that Nintendo
[02:10:45.140 --> 02:10:48.820]   is changing its corporate structure to a Western board style.
[02:10:48.820 --> 02:10:53.340]   You're going to be seeing more executives from Nintendo of America having control in
[02:10:53.340 --> 02:10:54.900]   the Japanese side of things.
[02:10:54.900 --> 02:10:57.300]   You're going to see a lot more democracy.
[02:10:57.300 --> 02:11:03.860]   You're not going to see the 100 years of Nintendo running things within a Japanese iron fist.
[02:11:03.860 --> 02:11:07.220]   And I think as a result, this is not the generation where they're giving up hardware.
[02:11:07.220 --> 02:11:11.940]   Nintendo very much wants to control how everything is presented, what's played.
[02:11:11.940 --> 02:11:16.500]   But I do see this baby being the last hurrah in the beginning of them going, "All right,
[02:11:16.500 --> 02:11:17.900]   let's be a services company.
[02:11:17.900 --> 02:11:22.140]   Let's make our, we can have, it's always been about controlling control.
[02:11:22.140 --> 02:11:26.440]   They want, you know, with the Wii and the Wii U and the DS, even the GameCube to some
[02:11:26.440 --> 02:11:28.540]   extent, they're all weird controllers.
[02:11:28.540 --> 02:11:29.540]   They're very obsessed with that.
[02:11:29.540 --> 02:11:34.260]   That's a very Miyamoto driven sort of thing, the creator of Super Mario.
[02:11:34.260 --> 02:11:39.340]   And I see that really fading away as all these other hardware companies leave the charge
[02:11:39.340 --> 02:11:42.780]   on interesting interactive systems.
[02:11:42.780 --> 02:11:47.500]   I do think that Nintendo NX, whatever its name is really going to be, is going to tie
[02:11:47.500 --> 02:11:48.500]   into smartphones.
[02:11:48.500 --> 02:11:51.180]   I think that they've been hinting at a weird controller.
[02:11:51.180 --> 02:11:55.860]   I really do believe it's going to be about taking the smartphone that everyone has all
[02:11:55.860 --> 02:11:59.660]   across, especially Japan and just saying, "We're going to have a standard controller,
[02:11:59.660 --> 02:12:04.100]   but we're going to make sure your smartphone is tied into this because we want your eyeballs
[02:12:04.100 --> 02:12:05.100]   all of the time."
[02:12:05.100 --> 02:12:08.100]   So I see this being the beginning of the end of Nintendo hardware.
[02:12:08.100 --> 02:12:09.620]   And I think it's going to do well.
[02:12:09.620 --> 02:12:12.500]   Look what I found on Lauren's purse.
[02:12:12.500 --> 02:12:13.500]   That is so cute.
[02:12:13.500 --> 02:12:15.220]   Oh, hello.
[02:12:15.220 --> 02:12:20.940]   Is this the new 3DS that is actually not available for sale?
[02:12:20.940 --> 02:12:23.420]   In America with an imported--
[02:12:23.420 --> 02:12:24.740]   Where did you get that?
[02:12:24.740 --> 02:12:25.900]   With an imported Japanese--
[02:12:25.900 --> 02:12:26.900]   Can I show it?
[02:12:26.900 --> 02:12:28.900]   Am I just broken here, NDA?
[02:12:28.900 --> 02:12:29.900]   You're totally fine.
[02:12:29.900 --> 02:12:30.900]   It's not a leaky.
[02:12:30.900 --> 02:12:31.900]   You can see.
[02:12:31.900 --> 02:12:32.900]   You can see.
[02:12:32.900 --> 02:12:33.900]   It's fully--
[02:12:33.900 --> 02:12:34.900]   Let's show the world.
[02:12:34.900 --> 02:12:35.900]   Animal Crossing.
[02:12:35.900 --> 02:12:36.900]   Oh, this looks so cute.
[02:12:36.900 --> 02:12:39.900]   With the replaceable front and back plates, which is great.
[02:12:39.900 --> 02:12:40.900]   Yeah, they sell front and back.
[02:12:40.900 --> 02:12:43.900]   So these are Animal Crossing back plates?
[02:12:43.900 --> 02:12:46.900]   This is-- yeah, those are all the characters.
[02:12:46.900 --> 02:12:52.540]   I mean, you can get any theme that you want, but being a big Animal Crossing fan as I am,
[02:12:52.540 --> 02:12:58.780]   if anybody has viewed on my laptop, I have the town assistant Isabelle is prominently
[02:12:58.780 --> 02:12:59.780]   featured.
[02:12:59.780 --> 02:13:00.780]   Oh, wow.
[02:13:00.780 --> 02:13:02.620]   Yeah, so I mean, I'm a big--
[02:13:02.620 --> 02:13:03.620]   As you can see.
[02:13:03.620 --> 02:13:05.860]   I'm a huge Nintendo fan.
[02:13:05.860 --> 02:13:08.660]   And to the point where I made the decision to--
[02:13:08.660 --> 02:13:14.260]   I got this 3DS and I imported a faceplate from Japan because I want to look like the
[02:13:14.260 --> 02:13:19.140]   coolest kid on my big wheel when I'm writing around the internet.
[02:13:19.140 --> 02:13:22.060]   But I think it's really important highlighting two things.
[02:13:22.060 --> 02:13:28.300]   One, the 3DS, again, I mean, it's reaching a transition phase, but they're still putting
[02:13:28.300 --> 02:13:31.980]   out great content for it and it's still selling very well.
[02:13:31.980 --> 02:13:33.980]   And also, the interesting thing is about the join--
[02:13:33.980 --> 02:13:34.980]   Oh, they're so cute.
[02:13:34.980 --> 02:13:37.340]   They turn their back when you go the other way.
[02:13:37.340 --> 02:13:42.900]   The interesting thing about the NX and Wii U crossover is I'm interested to see what kind
[02:13:42.900 --> 02:13:48.180]   of media they're going to use, whether or not they're going to use a disk, whether or
[02:13:48.180 --> 02:13:51.700]   not they're going to be backwards compatible, how they're going to decide to distribute their
[02:13:51.700 --> 02:13:52.700]   software.
[02:13:52.700 --> 02:13:54.180]   It's going to be really interesting.
[02:13:54.180 --> 02:13:59.580]   And I think that the Wii U will exist sort of as this archive system that also works
[02:13:59.580 --> 02:14:06.620]   with Wii games that-- and that will still be a family console that people will continue
[02:14:06.620 --> 02:14:10.260]   to go to if you have a busted Wii.
[02:14:10.260 --> 02:14:12.460]   You can get a Wii U and all that.
[02:14:12.460 --> 02:14:16.700]   But it'll be interesting to see, again, whether or not the NX does have a thoughtful interaction
[02:14:16.700 --> 02:14:17.700]   with smartphones.
[02:14:17.700 --> 02:14:19.580]   Because, yeah, I think that it will.
[02:14:19.580 --> 02:14:23.580]   And also, you're never going to see me once the Animal Crossing mobile game comes out.
[02:14:23.580 --> 02:14:25.580]   I apologize in advance.
[02:14:25.580 --> 02:14:26.580]   Wow.
[02:14:26.580 --> 02:14:27.740]   Wow.
[02:14:27.740 --> 02:14:31.180]   I really tapped into something here, haven't I?
[02:14:31.180 --> 02:14:33.940]   Wow.
[02:14:33.940 --> 02:14:35.500]   I don't get it at all.
[02:14:35.500 --> 02:14:40.380]   Now, Sega did this software-only thing and they've disappeared from the face of the
[02:14:40.380 --> 02:14:41.380]   Earth.
[02:14:41.380 --> 02:14:42.980]   They've sunk deep below the ocean's waves.
[02:14:42.980 --> 02:14:43.980]   Not so much disappeared.
[02:14:43.980 --> 02:14:45.460]   They absolutely scaled down.
[02:14:45.460 --> 02:14:49.900]   But they also combine, I want to say, with, was it Sammy or SNK?
[02:14:49.900 --> 02:14:53.540]   And they're actually-- and I know that they do a lot of slot machine work.
[02:14:53.540 --> 02:14:55.540]   Like they've taken all of their arcade expertise.
[02:14:55.540 --> 02:14:56.540]   Pachinko.
[02:14:56.540 --> 02:14:57.540]   Pachinko?
[02:14:57.540 --> 02:14:58.540]   Are they big into pachinko?
[02:14:58.540 --> 02:14:59.540]   Wow.
[02:14:59.540 --> 02:15:00.540]   Oh, yeah.
[02:15:00.540 --> 02:15:01.540]   Yeah.
[02:15:01.540 --> 02:15:02.540]   So they still took-- they pivoted.
[02:15:02.540 --> 02:15:03.540]   Right.
[02:15:03.540 --> 02:15:07.540]   I believe that it's an actual use of the word pivot that is correct.
[02:15:07.540 --> 02:15:11.900]   Why did you stick a Vive wand down your pants, Sam?
[02:15:11.900 --> 02:15:14.060]   Well, now we're getting to good stuff.
[02:15:14.060 --> 02:15:16.900]   It's a good twisty back.
[02:15:16.900 --> 02:15:22.520]   I found out-- I've been-- I'm very interested in virtual reality, not so much as putting
[02:15:22.520 --> 02:15:27.820]   a screen to my face as much as being able to do new things with computer systems, whether
[02:15:27.820 --> 02:15:29.500]   that's games or productivity.
[02:15:29.500 --> 02:15:33.460]   I think hand tracking is one of the most incredible things I'm obsessed with it.
[02:15:33.460 --> 02:15:37.740]   One of the big limitations with virtual reality is going around a big space.
[02:15:37.740 --> 02:15:42.500]   As soon as you put a headset on and you feel immersed, you dream of a Skyrim or a Zelda
[02:15:42.500 --> 02:15:43.500]   where you can wander--
[02:15:43.500 --> 02:15:44.500]   Oh, yeah.
[02:15:44.500 --> 02:15:45.500]   --when you want to--
[02:15:45.500 --> 02:15:46.500]   --with landscape.
[02:15:46.500 --> 02:15:47.500]   Which doesn't really work.
[02:15:47.500 --> 02:15:50.820]   However, as you can see right there on the video, I found an alternate path which was
[02:15:50.820 --> 02:15:56.060]   putting a little motion-tracked wand down the front of my pants or on a belt loop.
[02:15:56.060 --> 02:15:57.260]   I didn't have a belt at that time.
[02:15:57.260 --> 02:15:58.540]   I apologize.
[02:15:58.540 --> 02:16:03.420]   And then with the way that the tracker stations work for the Vive as opposed to Oculus, it's
[02:16:03.420 --> 02:16:05.300]   sees that, it sees my hip location.
[02:16:05.300 --> 02:16:06.300]   Oh, it is.
[02:16:06.300 --> 02:16:11.100]   And it can see if I am running in place, then it knows where my hip is turned.
[02:16:11.100 --> 02:16:16.780]   So as long as it has my hip alignment in place, then I can jog in place.
[02:16:16.780 --> 02:16:19.620]   And you'll see here, as I jog in place, it'll look like I'm moving.
[02:16:19.620 --> 02:16:21.500]   My body doesn't get sick.
[02:16:21.500 --> 02:16:24.700]   And I can turn my head and my arms and hands.
[02:16:24.700 --> 02:16:27.700]   You'll see as I'm moving around, I'm going to do a little turnaround in the video.
[02:16:27.700 --> 02:16:31.660]   What was really impressive was the feeling that I could run in place to move forward,
[02:16:31.660 --> 02:16:33.580]   but I could shoot a gun left and right.
[02:16:33.580 --> 02:16:37.340]   It had a very basic, this prototype had a very basic gun implement.
[02:16:37.340 --> 02:16:40.740]   So I could imagine myself in Call of Duty running away from bad guys and still shooting
[02:16:40.740 --> 02:16:42.900]   behind me or to my side.
[02:16:42.900 --> 02:16:45.660]   It's clearly not the best thing possible.
[02:16:45.660 --> 02:16:49.300]   But for some guy to simply say, let's just stick the wand down my pants and see what
[02:16:49.300 --> 02:16:55.420]   happens and have it be that convincing really sets a good tone for future implementations
[02:16:55.420 --> 02:16:56.940]   of this sort of thing.
[02:16:56.940 --> 02:16:59.900]   Now you're going to look silly if you run in place and you're going to look silly if
[02:16:59.900 --> 02:17:00.900]   you run in place.
[02:17:00.900 --> 02:17:05.100]   >> When you're playing VR of any kind, it doesn't really make you any look any time.
[02:17:05.100 --> 02:17:07.860]   >> It's early days and the guy who made it admitted as much.
[02:17:07.860 --> 02:17:11.620]   He said, this is way better than I expected considering cost nothing.
[02:17:11.620 --> 02:17:14.620]   So could probably implement like a really cheap belt to pull it off.
[02:17:14.620 --> 02:17:17.300]   >> So their wand is RF not visual.
[02:17:17.300 --> 02:17:18.300]   >> Correct.
[02:17:18.300 --> 02:17:19.700]   It's the smart thing.
[02:17:19.700 --> 02:17:22.180]   The lasers that are being rejected in your room are dumb.
[02:17:22.180 --> 02:17:28.420]   The wand is sending all that real time information via Bluetooth to your computer, recognizing
[02:17:28.420 --> 02:17:31.900]   your absolute position in the room and adjusting the game accordingly.
[02:17:31.900 --> 02:17:36.820]   So I just thought it was very, very inventive and I really like excuses of putting things
[02:17:36.820 --> 02:17:37.820]   down my pants.
[02:17:37.820 --> 02:17:38.820]   >> I love it.
[02:17:38.820 --> 02:17:39.820]   It was a dream day.
[02:17:39.820 --> 02:17:41.820]   >> Very cool.
[02:17:41.820 --> 02:17:44.460]   >> I don't think that's going to be the Nintendo Nx if that's what you're wondering.
[02:17:44.460 --> 02:17:46.460]   >> I'm wondering now.
[02:17:46.460 --> 02:17:53.340]   I played a little Samsung Gear VR Minecraft and that was actually surprisingly fun.
[02:17:53.340 --> 02:17:57.980]   Did you know, I know that Jason Clant, as our producer, told me about it and you said
[02:17:57.980 --> 02:17:59.740]   you played it for how many hours?
[02:17:59.740 --> 02:18:03.620]   >> Well, I can only play it for about an hour and a half before the battery would die.
[02:18:03.620 --> 02:18:04.620]   >> Okay.
[02:18:04.620 --> 02:18:06.820]   >> So I did play it in hour and a half windows.
[02:18:06.820 --> 02:18:10.020]   >> I mean, you're looking up, you're looking down, you're looking around, you're in the
[02:18:10.020 --> 02:18:12.220]   Minecraft world, you're moving around.
[02:18:12.220 --> 02:18:14.380]   >> I don't play Minecraft on my PC.
[02:18:14.380 --> 02:18:17.300]   I couldn't stop playing with it with the VR headset on.
[02:18:17.300 --> 02:18:18.300]   >> It's pretty fun.
[02:18:18.300 --> 02:18:21.620]   >> Leo, have you heard about the fact that someone has hacked this to work with the Vive
[02:18:21.620 --> 02:18:22.620]   as well?
[02:18:22.620 --> 02:18:27.740]   If you take your normal purchased Minecraft and hack the files just a little bit, you
[02:18:27.740 --> 02:18:33.980]   can have Minecraft with the Vive, which includes not only that relative head positioning, but
[02:18:33.980 --> 02:18:39.540]   also the ability to kind of look around, point in the distance to warp somewhere else.
[02:18:39.540 --> 02:18:43.980]   It actually, in my opinion, fixes all the nausea issues that happen with the Gear VR,
[02:18:43.980 --> 02:18:45.260]   which simulates walking.
[02:18:45.260 --> 02:18:49.260]   So if you're sitting down, but you simulate turning, you can get sick.
[02:18:49.260 --> 02:18:52.060]   The Vive version totally fixes that.
[02:18:52.060 --> 02:18:59.980]   Especially from Microsoft or Mojang has officially condoned or said, they get to say yay or nay
[02:18:59.980 --> 02:19:05.380]   to it, but it is so cool to get that feeling of, I actually had the guy who showed it to
[02:19:05.380 --> 02:19:09.940]   me the first time when he hacked it, had me dig a hole underneath my feet and then feel
[02:19:09.940 --> 02:19:11.380]   trapped inside of it.
[02:19:11.380 --> 02:19:14.740]   It was one of the most intense feelings I've ever had in VR.
[02:19:14.740 --> 02:19:18.140]   I think mostly because of Minecraft being this comfortable thing.
[02:19:18.140 --> 02:19:23.060]   I think the Gear VR version is a big deal because that is going to reach a lot of people.
[02:19:23.060 --> 02:19:26.340]   Doesn't that mean that Oculus will have it on its rift at some point soon?
[02:19:26.340 --> 02:19:27.340]   It is.
[02:19:27.340 --> 02:19:28.340]   Yeah.
[02:19:28.340 --> 02:19:29.340]   It will build a little bit of Windows 10.
[02:19:29.340 --> 02:19:30.340]   Yeah.
[02:19:30.340 --> 02:19:31.340]   They've been demoing that.
[02:19:31.340 --> 02:19:34.700]   Microsoft and Oculus have sort of teamed up and shown that off at events, but they always
[02:19:34.700 --> 02:19:41.060]   show it off with a bowl of ginger candy because it's the motion recreation with a controller,
[02:19:41.060 --> 02:19:46.060]   with a joystick, just messes with a vestibular system in a way that the Vive's move your
[02:19:46.060 --> 02:19:47.740]   own body around system does not.
[02:19:47.740 --> 02:19:48.740]   I have to get this Vive.
[02:19:48.740 --> 02:19:49.740]   True story.
[02:19:49.740 --> 02:19:56.620]   I demoed the Minecraft for Windows 10 with the Oculus Rift and had a really great time
[02:19:56.620 --> 02:20:03.060]   for 15 minutes and then ended up having to prop my body up against a tree outside of
[02:20:03.060 --> 02:20:08.620]   the event and talk myself out of throwing up in front of all of the security guards.
[02:20:08.620 --> 02:20:10.700]   It worked, but I was a wreck.
[02:20:10.700 --> 02:20:11.700]   Yeah, no.
[02:20:11.700 --> 02:20:16.900]   I actually got a little nauseous just with the Gear VR after just a little bit of time.
[02:20:16.900 --> 02:20:20.780]   But I do love the idea of being able to use my hands.
[02:20:20.780 --> 02:20:23.700]   Hey, you can shop with the Vive.
[02:20:23.700 --> 02:20:27.340]   You can shop and you can't do that with the Gear VR and Lord knows virtual chopping is
[02:20:27.340 --> 02:20:31.020]   going to really, really fill up the Christmas tree this year.
[02:20:31.020 --> 02:20:33.580]   Well, at least geeks are getting a little bit of exercise.
[02:20:33.580 --> 02:20:34.580]   Yes, just a little.
[02:20:34.580 --> 02:20:38.620]   Not a huge amount, but a little bit of exercise.
[02:20:38.620 --> 02:20:39.620]   Interesting.
[02:20:39.620 --> 02:20:43.860]   Is this the guy who invented it or is it just some video for the guy trying it out?
[02:20:43.860 --> 02:20:44.860]   He seems to love it.
[02:20:44.860 --> 02:20:46.220]   Just some schmuck we found on the street.
[02:20:46.220 --> 02:20:47.220]   Just some guy.
[02:20:47.220 --> 02:20:48.220]   Wow.
[02:20:48.220 --> 02:20:53.660]   Ladies and gentlemen, I think we should wrap it up with that bit of excitement.
[02:20:53.660 --> 02:20:55.980]   I'm excited.
[02:20:55.980 --> 02:20:57.340]   A lot of fun.
[02:20:57.340 --> 02:21:00.500]   You guys are fantastic.
[02:21:00.500 --> 02:21:01.660]   Please come back and do it all again.
[02:21:01.660 --> 02:21:08.660]   Lauren Hockenson and your Gold Bow and you're soon to be new employment or not.
[02:21:08.660 --> 02:21:09.660]   Yes.
[02:21:09.660 --> 02:21:10.660]   Yeah.
[02:21:10.660 --> 02:21:12.060]   I'll be announcing it probably this week.
[02:21:12.060 --> 02:21:13.060]   Okay, good.
[02:21:13.060 --> 02:21:14.060]   Yeah.
[02:21:14.060 --> 02:21:16.140]   We'll be watching on the Twitter or where will you announce it?
[02:21:16.140 --> 02:21:17.140]   We'll see.
[02:21:17.140 --> 02:21:19.300]   I mean, Twitter is the place for personal news.
[02:21:19.300 --> 02:21:20.300]   Right.
[02:21:20.300 --> 02:21:21.300]   So maybe that will happen.
[02:21:21.300 --> 02:21:22.300]   Do you have a blog?
[02:21:22.300 --> 02:21:23.300]   Do people your age have blogs?
[02:21:23.300 --> 02:21:24.300]   No.
[02:21:24.300 --> 02:21:25.300]   No.
[02:21:25.300 --> 02:21:28.940]   You can follow me on Snapchat or Instagram.
[02:21:28.940 --> 02:21:30.140]   And of course, nothing matters.
[02:21:30.140 --> 02:21:32.820]   My podcast is available on SoundCloud.
[02:21:32.820 --> 02:21:35.980]   We're at No Matters Cast on Twitter.
[02:21:35.980 --> 02:21:37.480]   And we're pretty.
[02:21:37.480 --> 02:21:40.660]   It's still kind of a new thing that I'm trying and experimenting with.
[02:21:40.660 --> 02:21:42.940]   So we're always looking for feedback.
[02:21:42.940 --> 02:21:45.740]   And yeah, you can find it also on.
[02:21:45.740 --> 02:21:50.620]   iTunes and Google Play and through your podcast app of choice.
[02:21:50.620 --> 02:21:51.620]   Nice.
[02:21:51.620 --> 02:21:54.140]   Sam Moskowitz, it's great to have you.
[02:21:54.140 --> 02:21:56.020]   Thank you so much for being here.
[02:21:56.020 --> 02:21:57.520]   ourstechnica.com.
[02:21:57.520 --> 02:21:59.260]   Sam Red on the Twitter.
[02:21:59.260 --> 02:22:01.820]   Anything you want to plug?
[02:22:01.820 --> 02:22:05.460]   Just the fact that a gentleman who's watching the show asked if I could make out with him
[02:22:05.460 --> 02:22:06.460]   because he said I'm hot.
[02:22:06.460 --> 02:22:08.220]   I think that's very flattering, sir.
[02:22:08.220 --> 02:22:12.220]   If you come up to Seattle and take me out for dinner, we'll figure it out.
[02:22:12.220 --> 02:22:16.980]   I really also want to say, Divindra and Lauren, I am so happy to be on the show with you
[02:22:16.980 --> 02:22:17.980]   guys.
[02:22:17.980 --> 02:22:18.980]   You're fantastic.
[02:22:18.980 --> 02:22:20.340]   I'm big fans of your work.
[02:22:20.340 --> 02:22:22.220]   Leo, you're all right, I guess.
[02:22:22.220 --> 02:22:26.820]   But yeah, just I'm going to be watching Captain America and writing about that.
[02:22:26.820 --> 02:22:30.220]   I've got a piece about the team who made the game Hover Junkers.
[02:22:30.220 --> 02:22:32.260]   I've got a feature about that team.
[02:22:32.260 --> 02:22:37.220]   It's a vibe game in which you are on a hovercraft and shoot at people as if it's the most intense
[02:22:37.220 --> 02:22:40.100]   laser tag like game I've ever played in virtual reality.
[02:22:40.100 --> 02:22:41.100]   And they're very great guys.
[02:22:41.100 --> 02:22:42.100]   So that's in the works.
[02:22:42.100 --> 02:22:47.020]   And otherwise, I'm just going to be apparently accepting date offers on Twitter.
[02:22:47.020 --> 02:22:48.020]   Thanks again for having me on.
[02:22:48.020 --> 02:22:49.020]   Oh, really great.
[02:22:49.020 --> 02:22:53.380]   And Sam is a regular on TNT every Friday, I think is going to be your regular day on
[02:22:53.380 --> 02:22:54.380]   that type of issue.
[02:22:54.380 --> 02:22:55.380]   Yes.
[02:22:55.380 --> 02:22:56.380]   Yeah, that's nice.
[02:22:56.380 --> 02:23:02.980]   Divindra always a thrill to Divindra Harder War senior editor at Engadget and slash film
[02:23:02.980 --> 02:23:03.980]   cast.
[02:23:03.980 --> 02:23:04.980]   Yes.
[02:23:04.980 --> 02:23:10.060]   At slash film.com, we'll have our summer movie wager podcast up soon.
[02:23:10.060 --> 02:23:13.140]   So we like take bets on like what's going to do best over the summer.
[02:23:13.140 --> 02:23:14.620]   So that episode's happening this week.
[02:23:14.620 --> 02:23:18.860]   Do you want to tip your hand on that or you prefer to keep it?
[02:23:18.860 --> 02:23:23.020]   I feel like most of us kind of agreed on what was going to be the winner and it's pretty
[02:23:23.020 --> 02:23:24.780]   much going to be Captain America.
[02:23:24.780 --> 02:23:25.780]   We'll see.
[02:23:25.780 --> 02:23:28.060]   I don't like comic book movies.
[02:23:28.060 --> 02:23:30.460]   The last Captain America movie is really good.
[02:23:30.460 --> 02:23:34.700]   Like even if you don't like the Marvel movies in general, like that one was really a good
[02:23:34.700 --> 02:23:35.700]   action movie.
[02:23:35.700 --> 02:23:36.700]   I don't know if you've seen it.
[02:23:36.700 --> 02:23:37.700]   Is that the winner's soldier or is that?
[02:23:37.700 --> 02:23:38.700]   No, it is the winner's soldier.
[02:23:38.700 --> 02:23:39.700]   All right.
[02:23:39.700 --> 02:23:41.100]   I have not seen it.
[02:23:41.100 --> 02:23:42.100]   So maybe tonight.
[02:23:42.100 --> 02:23:43.100]   You should see it.
[02:23:43.100 --> 02:23:44.100]   It's a great action movie.
[02:23:44.100 --> 02:23:46.420]   It's a great like almost like a 70 spy thriller to you.
[02:23:46.420 --> 02:23:48.220]   Like it's it's pretty good.
[02:23:48.220 --> 02:23:52.660]   Going to be bigger than the female Ghostbusters.
[02:23:52.660 --> 02:23:55.260]   I you know, I have a lot of hope for that one.
[02:23:55.260 --> 02:23:56.260]   That looks funny.
[02:23:56.260 --> 02:23:57.260]   I love the cast.
[02:23:57.260 --> 02:23:58.260]   It looks great.
[02:23:58.260 --> 02:23:59.260]   Yeah, I love them all.
[02:23:59.260 --> 02:24:04.620]   Paul Thagg's movies don't do like comic book movie level business, but it'll it'll be interesting
[02:24:04.620 --> 02:24:06.260]   to see there's that one in Suicide Squad.
[02:24:06.260 --> 02:24:08.900]   It's probably going to do big businesses here.
[02:24:08.900 --> 02:24:12.380]   I saw some really good trailers, but I can't remember any of them were for it.
[02:24:12.380 --> 02:24:13.380]   Looked like a good summer.
[02:24:13.380 --> 02:24:14.380]   Yeah.
