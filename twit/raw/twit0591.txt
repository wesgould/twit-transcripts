[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:26.040]   That's right. So it's not that code.uk. It's dot co. Yeah, I
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.320]   Need to do a few those it's a bit it's one better than dot com
[00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:38.020]   Little bit exactly you just you two work together at giga ohm Stacey was your editor briefly I
[00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:43.720]   Was like my mentor for forever. He's let's say eight years old
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.200]   Wow, yeah, yeah, and that actually I
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.320]   Still call him when I need help
[00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.200]   Oh, did you you started as a journalist? I?
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.320]   Yeah, yeah magazine writer
[00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.120]   Now news wire
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.600]   news wire
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:06.120]   Like associated press Reuters that guy no, no, it's like newspaper
[00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.240]   news wires and then
[00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:15.560]   Went to weekly publications and then got to the US and it was financial news wire
[00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.880]   Which is a new case?
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.880]   financial news wire ah
[00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:27.160]   And then was one of the first people to sign on to the dot com revolution before it was
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:34.000]   Hip and cool to be dot com reporters. Well, I remember reading you first. I think in Tony Perkins red herring. I
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.680]   Was way before that I was writing for Forbes and Forbes calm interesting and
[00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.520]   before that Nikkei and before that
[00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:49.800]   Publications you've never heard of business 2.0 in 2001 you created giga ohm and
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.080]   You had a good run with it
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.600]   then it just yeah disappeared in
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.440]   March 2015 sad
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:04.800]   Sad and that's when Stacy was out of work now. I think that was
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:10.880]   the next evolution in Stacy's quest to dominate the war of IOT
[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.080]   I
[00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:20.280]   Completely agree and we become big fans of Stacy. She joined Twig about six months ago and is a really wonderful contributor to our show
[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:25.680]   She's good not just in writing. She's good on the air. You know as you as are you oh? I
[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.360]   Think could not as good as Stacy though
[00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.240]   Okay, you guys are like
[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:39.600]   Oh, yeah, that's right. You know what I hate it when podcasts just do that right? They just they're not we're here to help people
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.640]   Understand the modern world for instance
[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:49.640]   Focus Silicon Valley. It's got an empathy vacuum. Okay before we go there. How did you get that?
[00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:52.320]   Microsoft
[00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:57.840]   Computer oh you like my computer. Yeah, how did you get it? I bought it dude? I bought it
[00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:02.760]   I went out. I can't I can't get it. You didn't buy it soon enough. I bought it when they announced it and
[00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:05.760]   Now it's auto production
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:07.960]   Yeah, right
[00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:09.960]   Could be
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:13.040]   No, I think the deal with it. This is the Surface Studio
[00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:21.600]   Not a cheap computer. This is the base model which is three thousand dollars for kind of a low-end because really it is a laptop
[00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:27.000]   That's what this little box underneath is with the best screen you ever you know 28 inch
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.480]   super high res 4500 by 3,000
[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:35.480]   Screen I mean it's just a gorgeous screen and you can you know you can you can mess with it
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:41.360]   You can do stuff like that. It's really I just I just it feels like a giant iPad is what it feels like I
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.720]   Think is your dream come true computer?
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.520]   Look at this. This isn't this kind of like I feel like Shepard Smith on
[00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:51.560]   Fox News with I made a little giant
[00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:56.000]   tablet I remember seeing you back in the day in
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:02.040]   Screen savers the real one. Yeah, and then you had the real one
[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:08.680]   I mean like version one. Yeah, thank you one point out not the real one the first one
[00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:14.600]   And the you know I that's when I became your big fan. Oh, thank you for me
[00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:23.640]   That's the real one right and you had that computer embedded in your table remember. Yeah, and so it's like seems like I'm back
[00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:29.960]   Yeah, it's kind of like that. This could be embedded in table. I kind of you and Chris burrello. Oh my god
[00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:37.200]   Is he still working on on podcast and stuff? No, I don't think so. He's the locker gnome and he's kind of
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:42.200]   I don't know what he's doing the last time I checked he had a live stream
[00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:50.520]   But now I think if I go to locker gnome.com. It's kind of like a Pinterest for geeks. I'm not sure what he's what he's really doing
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:55.480]   Okay. Yeah, I love Chris and you know, he's
[00:07:55.480 --> 00:08:04.080]   He's always been really good at using social and streaming to do stuff ever since tech TV one of the best things about tech TV is the
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:07.320]   Diaspora, I'm sure this is exactly true of giga home as well
[00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:09.360]   afterwards
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:10.720]   everybody kind of
[00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:17.920]   Brought that ethos out into the world and it was it was good. I hope so I think you know, Stacey's doing her thing. Yep
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:23.840]   I think you're gonna see some more stuff coming up soon. So not just for me but from others. Oh
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:31.040]   Nice. Well, we know Matthew's doing great. He's over at fortune a lot of people went to fortune initially. I know you did Stacy
[00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:37.720]   Who else six of us six Matthew Jeff Jeff John Roberts
[00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:41.880]   Katy Farron Bocker bar Darrow
[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:45.080]   Jonathan Vanion
[00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:50.800]   And then and then you and then yanko went to variety where he's doing a lot of great stuff yanko records
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:54.520]   Am I saying his name right yanko records? Yeah, go right goes
[00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:59.880]   And then Kevin is with me on the show and then Google. Yeah
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:05.120]   Then Kevin fotured went to another company Derek Harris went to a company
[00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:08.680]   I'm trying to think who else did we have I think when you have
[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:11.040]   You know what go ahead
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:15.240]   I was gonna say this went to business insider where she's doing great stuff and then
[00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:17.560]   Cina is doing all kinds of cool stuff too
[00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:23.520]   freelancing and she's working with tech crunch a little bit and MIT tech review and stuff
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:27.680]   So they're all everybody's out there. I
[00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:34.160]   Think you know, I'm thinking about I just saw a profile of Jessica lesson and the information
[00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:38.400]   In the New York Times, I think right knows
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:42.240]   CGR that's right. Let me I know what I'm reviewing. That's right
[00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:47.480]   Celebrating how well she's doing how well the information is doing
[00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:51.400]   And I think that this is an interesting model
[00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:55.320]   For the future of hardcore
[00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:58.360]   News hardcore
[00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:03.960]   Information she's got a paywall an expensive four hundred dollar a year paywall which I pay for it's worth it
[00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:08.840]   And I think it is worth it and apparently there's subscriptions have doubled in the last year and yeah
[00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:11.800]   She's got 20 employees. They're doing great stuff
[00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:18.720]   She's always she and Amir have always broken a lot of news and they're continuing to do that by kind of focusing
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:24.680]   This is kind of what gig almost good at focusing on the big stories and fine and getting you know unique
[00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:27.360]   insight and information about them
[00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:30.480]   She also offers I think this is kind of interesting
[00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:37.920]   When news breaks she does a conference call with the reporters who've been covering the story. Yeah, I think that's I'm like I
[00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:43.680]   Have it. I don't know. She charges for that or what I think I think that's part of the package
[00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:48.600]   I think so as a subscriber I can do that and I keep I keep meaning to do it and I keep forgetting to
[00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:53.520]   To sign into those because I was like that. I remember that company Pearson
[00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:56.820]   Lehman that's still a chialg is still around
[00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:01.960]   Gilji and they basically do the same thing organize conference calls
[00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:06.120]   So she's taken a lot of the best ideas from
[00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:13.280]   From Gilji from us and wherever and put together a really working combo, which is great
[00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:17.280]   And you know, it's good to have a place which is not
[00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:20.400]   distracted by advertising. Yeah
[00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:27.080]   Linkbait has really become a the biggest issue. We talked so much about fake news of
[00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:32.440]   Late because of the election, but I think it really goes back more to linkbait and
[00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:39.440]   Really ultimately fake news succeeds because it gets you to click the link in the and the guys who are making up the fake news
[00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:41.440]   Get the advertising revenue
[00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:46.760]   So it's really just another it's just linkbait to the final, you know degree, right?
[00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:49.400]   Right, it's depressing
[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:56.520]   Well, yeah, it's all right. That's all right. It's okay to be depressed as a male
[00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:58.880]   No, I think it's
[00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:06.320]   Forces people to think about new and better ideas. Yeah, right? Well, what happened we broke the internet
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:08.320]   I think this is really what happened
[00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:10.720]   The internet started out really great
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:13.400]   And then we broke it
[00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:18.240]   We broke it in a number of ways with monodys the monetization models really
[00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:20.600]   promoted
[00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:26.640]   Things like linkbait and and punch the monkey banner ads ad tech went crazy
[00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:36.120]   Hate speech found a way to express itself and all of these things kind of converged to take what was this kind of utopia and
[00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:40.200]   Turn it into a dystopia and it feels like that happened in the last year. Oh
[00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:44.400]   No, no, it's been happening forever. Well, it's been getting worse and worse
[00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:49.480]   But it feels like it just kind of came to a head. I know linkbait's been a problem for years. I guess
[00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:53.880]   I think it's had an impact on the real world outside of the internet maybe in this last year
[00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:58.680]   Yeah, would be a way to think I mean like it's been happening forever, but most people could avoid it
[00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:02.320]   I mean as part of tech encroaching on everyday life everywhere. I guess you're right so
[00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:09.040]   Which makes ohms empathy gap even more important. So what do you mean? This is a New Yorker piece
[00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:12.040]   And by the way, it's been great to read you in the New Yorker. I just
[00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:19.000]   Thrilled to see this silicon Valley. This was this week in the New Yorker has an empathy vacuum
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:30.360]   Is it the job of a company to have empathy or merely to return a good and good dollar to its investors I
[00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:34.680]   Mean depends on what kind of society we want to live in
[00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:41.680]   Right, I think the at the end of the day if you are going to create a society in which
[00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:44.880]   Only the winners get to you know
[00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:52.280]   Have it all what happens to the rest of the society what happens to the whole economic system down the line
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:56.080]   Where do people go people who are purchasing?
[00:13:56.080 --> 00:14:02.480]   You know things which allow companies to market their ads on Facebook are
[00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:04.880]   Fewer and fewer
[00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:07.760]   Those ads are also going to become fewer and fewer
[00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:15.600]   So it's not just the question of like being charitable, but it's more about having a more equitable society in a way
[00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:18.680]   that you're actually actively thinking about the
[00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:28.080]   Disruption you are causing and what are the things you can do to help bring you know bring along people whose lives are getting disrupted
[00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:34.200]   I'm not talking about charity here, but I'm talking about are there opportunities for retrenchment
[00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:36.780]   Are we thinking about you know longer term?
[00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:42.000]   How a technology has an impact on other things and I think that's what I mean is in
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:48.200]   Order to even think about those things we have to put ourselves in the shoes of other people
[00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:53.840]   And I think if this election showed anything we refuse to put us
[00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:57.840]   in other people's shoes regardless of what side of
[00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:06.160]   Political spectrum you really are and what kind of and I think it is more and more prevalent in Silicon Valley
[00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:15.200]   Where everything is so focused on building returns and and growth and then just kind of moving on to the next thing and my view is
[00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:19.680]   Let's not let's not you know forget that there is
[00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:27.240]   People at the end of this technology who are going to get impacted and we have to think about those things
[00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:32.520]   We can't just run away from those things. That's the whole piece was all about that
[00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:40.400]   That's like how do we internalize other people's reality as well and which probably will lead us to build
[00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:43.560]   better more thoughtful products in the future
[00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:46.760]   It's good business to
[00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:48.640]   consider
[00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:50.640]   your customers and
[00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:54.080]   And society and the impact what you do has on them
[00:15:54.080 --> 00:16:01.480]   It's kind of but it's more long-term thinking than quarterly results that's that is exactly the case and I think companies
[00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:03.960]   need to stand up to
[00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:10.120]   Those kind of values now if you know look at I don't know if you saw the news from Facebook
[00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:18.040]   Yesterday, I think December 2nd. They said oh we are gonna do 20 million in donation and spend on
[00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:21.840]   affordable housing in Menlo Park and East Palo Alto and
[00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:25.160]   And I think that's a great idea
[00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:27.800]   In a large scheme of things
[00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:35.840]   But like how does it going to work out for the entire community if all the houses are being bought by people who live and
[00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:43.040]   Work for Facebook, you know, there are certain demographics. So suddenly people who are low-income
[00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:50.920]   Housing, you know users. They don't have a place to live in the entire ecosystem, right?
[00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:57.800]   They can't afford, you know, the whole food is gonna move in and not like, you know, it will be it will be the
[00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:00.120]   the schools and the
[00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:03.800]   You know health systems everything is gonna evolve around
[00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:07.120]   the people who work for Facebook not for
[00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:14.640]   People who have lived there and eventually they will have to move out so to say that 20 million dollars is what we are doing
[00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:17.920]   That's like that's nice charity, but in the end
[00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:23.800]   That's the lack of empathy right right all the way through, you know
[00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:28.880]   But you know Zuckerberg and Cheryl and whomever and they they don't seem to
[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:31.760]   Kind of even think about those things
[00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:39.840]   Pala Lai so is a really good example of I mean people who don't know Silicon Valley Palo Alto is a very affluent town
[00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:45.800]   That's near where Steve Jobs lived and when the Palo Alto Apple store
[00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:48.400]   Started some of the iPhone that's where Jobs would go
[00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:55.400]   The downtown Palo Alto is very gentrified cute thing, but like a lot of American cities
[00:17:55.400 --> 00:18:02.200]   There's this, you know pretty part and then there's the part where people live who work there
[00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:06.880]   East Palo Alto and it's very poor and
[00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:13.480]   It's often ignored by the residents of fancy Palo West Palo Alto
[00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:19.240]   And so it's a really good it's a very in microcosm an example of what's happening all over the country
[00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:27.360]   But but how could it be bad that Facebook is donating 20 million dollars towards affordable housing? That's a good thing, isn't it?
[00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:30.520]   Yeah on paper it sounds like a good thing right
[00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:38.160]   But I'm trying to say is that five years down the line when all the houses are built the people who are living there are the engineers and
[00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:39.800]   Yeah, and the
[00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:46.120]   Just building building more housing for their people ultimately exactly and then will the people who are in the affordable housing?
[00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:49.000]   Can they afford any of the services in the area?
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:53.080]   Can they afford the doctors? Can they go afford to send their kids to the school?
[00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:58.080]   Can they even go grocery shopping there? Can they do all these things which?
[00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:03.600]   You know normally people are able to do because once you know the the yuppies move in
[00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:05.160]   does
[00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:09.040]   You know the cost of living goes up and what that means is
[00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:12.760]   You know people who can't keep up they are out, right?
[00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:15.440]   Which is unfortunately the reality of our
[00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:20.560]   modern society, but just to kind of say that we are giving 20 million dollars
[00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:26.960]   I think that is completely you know missing the point and that is another proof point of
[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:35.200]   You know selecting value missing that empathy gene. It's like really you don't you don't think that five years down the line
[00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:41.720]   This is going to be a problem and they have to start it to treat everything as like a can we negate?
[00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:46.120]   Press negative press attention by giving some money
[00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:51.480]   I think this is like something which really makes me mad is just like yes
[00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:58.400]   You can do whatever you want to do but then figure out you know use your IQ to figure out ways to
[00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:05.240]   Bring together all the people you're going to impact and like take them and lift them through the through the boom
[00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:10.320]   That is the Facebook housing is going to bring there, but again, that's not part of the conversation
[00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:13.760]   20 million dollar check is not the answer
[00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:18.080]   Should it be part of the conversation? I
[00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:26.400]   You know I think about the atom bomb and all the scientists in the United States who joined the Manhattan Project
[00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:31.080]   Robert Oppenheimer who very famously said now I've become
[00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:34.600]   Was it Kali the the goddess of death?
[00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:40.080]   And now I become destruction when the atom bomb was first set off
[00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:43.880]   Often times I think technologists work on stuff
[00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:48.160]   Well in this case they had a motivation they wanted to beat
[00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:52.080]   Nazis to to to an atom bomb, but I
[00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:58.920]   Think oftentimes technologists work on technology for technology sake science for science sake and say you know
[00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:04.520]   We can't be responsible for the impact technology has and I wonder if you know
[00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:11.600]   It's interesting that you you write this article this time because there's also I think it's in the Wall Street Journal this week
[00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:18.600]   And there's this growing movement of empathy is actually bad for public policy. You've probably seen this as well
[00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:23.800]   That if that action go ahead. Oh, I was gonna say that that makes sense
[00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:30.600]   I mean one of the things like oh when you're talking about empathy. I think about externalities right the economic kind of
[00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:34.120]   The impact of your stuff beyond what you're paying
[00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:37.680]   Your profits and that sort of thing
[00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:39.680]   and you can't
[00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:42.400]   There has to be a limit if you're a company
[00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:44.400]   that is
[00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:48.720]   trying to think about other people you have to you have to draw the line somewhere and
[00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:55.680]   everyone's gonna debate where that line is in I think it's important for any kind of tech company or
[00:21:55.680 --> 00:22:00.760]   person in technology to think about the externalities of their
[00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:03.520]   Whatever they're developing whatever they're doing
[00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:05.320]   but
[00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:08.480]   at the end of the day they still have to focus on profits in
[00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:12.000]   The question is how far do you take it?
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:18.400]   I'm sure on that you were aware of and probably maybe even responding to Paul Bloom's New Yorker article earlier this year
[00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:26.200]   a case against empathy in which he points out that empathy suffers from this identifiable victim effect where
[00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:30.640]   You can identify the specific victims and as a result make
[00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:34.960]   public policy that may also may help the specific
[00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:40.480]   identified victim and hurt the kind of invisible victims over the long haul or
[00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:48.800]   It's just the unsympathetic victims. I mean we're seeing that in Texas when they're yes instead of debating whether or not Texas should
[00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:54.280]   Take care of its Medicaid obligations because there are kind of in a fight right now with
[00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:56.760]   Obama care basically
[00:22:56.760 --> 00:23:04.400]   Instead they're crafting these crazy laws and they're they're doing these crazy exemptions to the policies and
[00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:09.600]   funding and then some group that's really sympathetic like children who need
[00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:14.240]   Prosthetic limbs or children who need mental health therapy
[00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:20.560]   Suddenly they're like oh we're in the fire that fire line for this and then the politicians come in and they're like okay
[00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:24.320]   We'll take care of everyone or we'll take care of these guys
[00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:27.040]   and everyone else who's unsympathetic goes away and
[00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:32.280]   That's a terrible way to impact policy, but that's a different conversation
[00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:37.200]   Maybe we just want a larger an empathy that has a larger sense
[00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:41.880]   then I think baby Jessica and the well or you know I
[00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:49.480]   Think there's a lot of people who confuse sympathy with empathy and I think what I'm trying to talk about is actually trying to understand
[00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:53.040]   What other people are talking about what other people are?
[00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:59.920]   Dealing with what the impact is on other people. I'm not saying take a sympathetic action
[00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:06.520]   I'm just saying if you do not understand how can you build better products? How can you build a better society?
[00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:10.080]   Sympathy is not going to lead to a better society
[00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:12.600]   Listening better and trying to internalize
[00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:17.680]   other people's issues and trying to figure out how to better improve
[00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:22.840]   The environment we live in or the products we build is important
[00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:26.920]   so like you saw the whole issue with Facebook and fake news and
[00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:31.200]   And just to they were denying it for so long and how can you deny?
[00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:33.720]   something you are
[00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:39.720]   Complace certain and just kind of just because you say you you you are not able to fix it
[00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:43.920]   We should believe you and that's kind of what I mean is like wait
[00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:48.840]   You're not even thinking and listening to people who are talking about fake news
[00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:55.920]   You're just like just dismissing them with the wave of your hand and and so that's what I mean is like that's not where
[00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:59.400]   We are as an industry. We need to kind of listen better
[00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:04.800]   Internalize a lot of things and then start to see what we can do and what we can't do
[00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:07.920]   I mean if you know Stacy you're talking about
[00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:12.320]   What is the limit for the companies? I think if they are
[00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:17.080]   If you know they are doing this for a profit reason they are
[00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:24.640]   Building housing right next to their offices because people can come and work longer hours in there in the company office
[00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:27.600]   But remember the company cities
[00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:34.040]   Whether it was Cleveland or Pittsburgh or wherever they the big companies paid for healthcare
[00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:38.840]   They paid for schools. They even paid for colleges and schools engineering schools
[00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:44.720]   All those things they paid for by the because that was part of the social contract they had
[00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:51.720]   This is not like socialism. This was like a capitalist company like US deal or whom so ever was
[00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:57.880]   Looking out for its own interest and I think that's what if Facebook is looking out for its own interest
[00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:01.200]   It should go beyond giving 20 million dollars in housing
[00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:06.560]   Subsidies and you know and saying okay, that's good enough. No, if you want to do this
[00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:14.280]   You know build build up the whole East Palo Alto menopark area provide the services which will lift not just their
[00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:22.200]   Their you know engineering teams, but also people who are not engineers people who work in the back of you know Facebook offices
[00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:27.900]   There will be more jobs like that can those people stay within the community can their kids
[00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:33.240]   Aspired to go to the same college and school as you know everybody else's case
[00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:39.840]   So I think that is what I mean. It's not don't be sympathetic to the cause and just say oh here is some money
[00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:48.040]   No empathy is like kind of saying what is other people's problems? What are their hopes and dreams trying to understand that is very important
[00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:53.320]   That is good corporate, you know management that is good capitalism and I think
[00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:57.920]   It's time to actually think and talk about those things
[00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:05.940]   Dr. Bloom who just wrote a piece in the Wall Street Journal and whose book against empathy comes out next week I
[00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:12.480]   Think agrees with you actually on but he prefers the word compassion. He says there's a difference to an empathy and
[00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:21.200]   compassion and that when we and there's even a brain chemistry difference between empathy and compassion compassion is
[00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:25.240]   More having a sense of
[00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:29.040]   Feeling for and not feeling with
[00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:36.920]   It is characterized by feelings of warmth concern and care for the other as well as a strong motivation to improve the others
[00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:40.960]   Well-being empathy ends up just like using the word sympathy actually
[00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:44.580]   Is more feeling what the other feels as opposed to?
[00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:50.520]   Concern about improving everybody's I think yeah, and I think I say that in my piece
[00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:56.760]   It's like empathy is not a marketing slogan. It's like you either you either are empathetic or you're not
[00:27:57.160 --> 00:28:04.920]   Right, and and that's the key thing is I guess the point I was making is that technology doesn't have empathy or compassion. It just is and
[00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:12.440]   Right well technology, but there are people behind all ten understand, but you know you can if you don't so I
[00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:16.680]   Mean pick any technical innovation. Let's say cloning which obviously has
[00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:19.520]   positives and negatives
[00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:25.080]   You can say well, we're not gonna do cloning as we have said in the United States, but China might say well
[00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:31.400]   That's fine because we're gonna do it technology always seems to out. It's like water. It seems to always find a way
[00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:35.520]   So I don't know if empathy can block a technology
[00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:43.200]   You don't need a block of technology you need it you need to have your company or as someone who's inventing tech or
[00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:45.880]   implementing technology
[00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:50.640]   Think about how it affects others and try to understand the other point of view
[00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:57.040]   Yeah, I was gonna give you an example actually of and it's gonna come from a company that oh me get upset or not upset with but
[00:28:57.040 --> 00:28:59.280]   it's not a favorite company of his but
[00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:01.960]   AT&T actually is
[00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:06.200]   Aware that its business is kind of under threat and it's changing
[00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:15.400]   It's corporate infrastructure and its technology to do software to find networking and as part of that it's retraining a
[00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:23.560]   Huge chunk of its workers. It's offering a lot of Udacity courses and paying come paying its employees to take these courses to help
[00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:31.080]   Get them ready from the world where they you know physically manipulated cables to a world where they're gonna do it digitally
[00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:34.880]   And I think that's actually a really good example of saying hey
[00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:38.040]   we're gonna implement an entirely new technology across our business and
[00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:45.920]   Our people aren't gonna be able to keep up and we can argue that AT&T is doing this because a lot of their workers are unionized and
[00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:47.920]   Yay
[00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:53.440]   But at the same time, it's kind of a nice example of a tech change being met with
[00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:56.200]   empathy or compassion
[00:29:56.200 --> 00:30:02.160]   well the biggest issue in America today is income inequality and I mean
[00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:10.320]   It's with all with all the the unicorns out there. It's very clear that there are some and I think this is part of the
[00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:14.960]   Malazit we're feeling in this country is you see people getting intensely rich
[00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:17.960]   While so many are struggling
[00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:22.720]   But I don't know if Silicon Valley can solve that problem. Do you think it can um?
[00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:29.480]   What do you mean by solve that problem that there are no jobs can it act in a way that yeah
[00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:32.880]   I mean if automation causes people to lose jobs and
[00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:39.800]   Automation is part of the business of you know robotics and artificial intelligence and
[00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:46.520]   Are you saying not to do it? Are you how do how do you how do you adjust what you're doing?
[00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:51.440]   To protect people. I understand I think it would be wonderful to protect those jobs
[00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:55.800]   Well, I mean you look at what just Casey just said he said you are
[00:30:55.800 --> 00:31:05.920]   essentially helping retrain the current workforce for a new future now out of 50,000 people maybe 20,000 people
[00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:13.040]   Will have a job and 30 per thousand people won't but it's still better than 50,000 people not having a job
[00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:19.360]   I'm not saying I am not against the idea of technology. I love all the progress
[00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:24.000]   We make but I'm also trying to figure out is what more can we do?
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:29.800]   To start bringing people along as we grow going to this future
[00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:34.520]   Can we figure out new jobs? Can we figure out new opportunities?
[00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:38.020]   Can we figure out how to retrain the workforce is?
[00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:43.760]   of the of the of the industrial era for this new new time frame can we
[00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:47.520]   afford to give up on three to four generations of people
[00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:55.160]   Before everybody starts to kind of become part of the workforce all over again and the answer to that
[00:31:55.160 --> 00:32:02.360]   Can be yes because that is a very fruitful you know fearful future. I I fear for
[00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:08.760]   So many people who will be just left without jobs and then what are we gonna do to this to them?
[00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:14.680]   Like how will we take care of the society and I think it's important to figure out
[00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:20.520]   Even even a little little bit of effort is more than no effort
[00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:26.760]   And that's what this whole piece was all about yes, and we're heading there's pal Mel
[00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:32.160]   We're heading towards a future where many people you know just as industrialization cost people jobs
[00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:39.320]   We're a post-industrial America those jobs. I mean the solution is not to recreate the steel industry in the United States
[00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:45.480]   And they there are tough challenges and automation is one of them, and that's not gonna turn around and stop
[00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:47.480]   I agree we need to consider it
[00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:53.680]   But I don't know if Silicon Valley has the as the so outside of solving
[00:32:53.680 --> 00:33:00.760]   Social issues and inequality. There's also a part of ohms thing possibly or maybe it's me adding to it
[00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:04.840]   Think about how your products perpetuate
[00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:08.480]   inequality or yes, yeah help
[00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:16.320]   people maybe avoid interact I mean like so you know filter bubbles is a is a very simple example, but another is
[00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:23.720]   things like when you're starting to use algorithms to you know map out safe routes home. Where does that take people?
[00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:28.440]   This was kind of part of the weapons of math destruction. I mean it's basically
[00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:33.200]   We are we put so much faith and technology that
[00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:39.880]   Maybe we shouldn't and or maybe she I'm saying it doesn't matter because it's gonna happen
[00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:47.720]   So faith or not this is we're on this road. It's not gonna suddenly. Oh, let's just you know, let's let's grow flowers and
[00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:54.360]   Cut the souls off of our shoes. It's not gonna happen. I you know and so let's talk about the filter bubble
[00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:56.760]   I mean oh you talk about this in your your piece
[00:33:56.760 --> 00:33:59.640]   Facebook
[00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:03.840]   Makes he says Facebook as a company makes these bubble blunders again and again
[00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:08.880]   But what is face? What is Facebook to do Facebook right now?
[00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:11.440]   Optimizes its algorithm to improve
[00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:14.120]   you reader engagement
[00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:19.600]   Period and it works we can see the numbers we can see it works
[00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:23.240]   Is it Facebook's job to change how human beings?
[00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:26.040]   work
[00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:32.360]   Because what do you mean by that? Well, I'm just saying if Facebook look it let's say it's Facebook's responsibility to optimize
[00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:38.040]   It's you to make TV has by the way TV is grappled with this for years
[00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:41.240]   do you give people what they want and
[00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:44.040]   get increasing ratings or
[00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:47.800]   Do you say well with a spoonful of sugar?
[00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:54.080]   We're also gonna make the medicine go down and we're gonna beef up our news operations even though nobody watches them
[00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:58.600]   Because we have a societal obligation is I think you're supposed to do the same thing
[00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:03.320]   It's a that's a pretty illogical argument to be honest. I think you
[00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:06.600]   Get spam in your inbox
[00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:14.280]   Do you not get mad with Google or sending you spam and don't you think it's their problem to fix the spam problem?
[00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:23.700]   Fake news is the equivalent of spam on a media centric platform like Facebook Facebook is a business designed to optimize
[00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:28.420]   For profit. Oh so is like Gmail optimized around
[00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:34.640]   delivering more email to you the more spam email you get more you're gonna stick into the
[00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:39.640]   Stay in the inbox. So they're gonna have to figure out a new business model around that
[00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:43.280]   So I think what I'm saying is that as a platform
[00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:49.940]   Which you know is based on now they're like the media platform for the planet
[00:35:50.180 --> 00:35:55.260]   It is important for them to make sure that there is no fake news platform
[00:35:55.260 --> 00:36:03.460]   origin stories popping on to the to the system. It's just like spam. It's like it's just they are preventing us from
[00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:10.000]   Using you know like like getting spam. Well, it's all right to extend your analogy though some spam
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:14.680]   It's obviously spam if the word Viagra is in its spell with a one. I know it's spam
[00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:21.400]   The problem is and Facebook has this problem and Gmail has this problem. There's some email
[00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:26.480]   That is debatable. There's some fake news that's debatable
[00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:33.280]   Should it should let's say an atheist decides well anything about God is
[00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:40.520]   Fake because there is no God so I'm gonna eliminate all God stories from Facebook
[00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:43.380]   that's an extreme example but
[00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:50.420]   Well, I think that is an extreme example to prove your case when I'm talking about is Mrs. Clinton
[00:36:50.420 --> 00:36:58.320]   Killed a child or did some murder like is responsible for so many murders. There's some so that's a news we can all agree
[00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:03.240]   Coming out of Macedonia from a Macedonian website how the hell that is
[00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:09.080]   Right and then why didn't they do it like that's the basic problem there and as I said damn
[00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:12.520]   There's a gray area. So you're saying let's just do the obvious stuff
[00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:18.480]   The obvious stuff was the bigger problem than just the non obvious stuff. I just agree because I think
[00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:23.360]   The bigger problem is not I mean the Pope endorses Donald Trump
[00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:26.680]   blatantly fake eat provably wrong
[00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:31.440]   Not a big important thing frankly the conspiracy theory
[00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:40.180]   That the that a pizza parlor in Washington DC is a child porn ring or that the president is a Kenyan born non-American citizen those things
[00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:44.080]   Have a life of their own regardless of Facebook
[00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:49.080]   Has nothing to do with Facebook because people want to believe them people do believe them
[00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:53.080]   Is it Facebook's job to say oh no no that's not true
[00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:56.080]   I think I think a lot a
[00:37:56.080 --> 00:37:58.960]   lot of people see that and think about it I mean
[00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:04.560]   The number of things you see just flying by you read it it becomes part of your consciousness
[00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:08.680]   You don't even think about it and in Facebook that happens a lot and so then you pull these things out
[00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:12.680]   Oh, I saw that somewhere. There's like a child porn ring staffed by right now
[00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:15.800]   I understand the mechanism, but is it is it really Facebook's obligation?
[00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:22.440]   Yes, it's it's it should be as a platform, but there's lots of people who would argue it's true
[00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:32.000]   It's not true and it causes actual detriment and the problem with conspiracy theories is it's very hard to prove them not true
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:38.080]   You can't prove the negative and so I think it's provably true that the Pope did not endorse Donald Trump
[00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:41.720]   Just ask the Pope it is much more difficult to prove some of these other things
[00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:44.360]   That's why they live on their conspiracy theories
[00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:48.160]   And I don't know if I want Facebook to get in the job of a
[00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:50.880]   censorship at that point
[00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:55.520]   You could but we've talked about this we've talked about having feedback from readers
[00:38:55.520 --> 00:39:00.840]   So if I see this in my feed I agree there's some mechanisms right there's some mechanisms
[00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:07.240]   And I think also a labeling like just like Google when they send it this may be spam
[00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:10.800]   Yeah, this may be help the reader give them more information
[00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:14.760]   I'm I'm kind of okay with that, but I but home would you want them to block?
[00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:18.880]   birther stories or block 9/11 conspiracy stories
[00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:24.760]   It depends on where they're coming from if they're coming from some website in you know
[00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:30.840]   Eastern Europe or they're coming out from some dumb website and you know, it's like some other country like that
[00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:35.820]   Yeah, they should be blocking those and you know if those stories are on let's say, you know
[00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:42.880]   Any of the alt-right websites? Well, you know, it's kind of debatable whether they're right or they're wrong
[00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:46.800]   I think this is tricky. I think this is tricky. I think then you have you have
[00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:55.040]   One group you this is more polarizing denying the truth of another group saying it's obviously not true and
[00:39:55.040 --> 00:40:03.400]   The other group saying well, it's obviously is true show me where it's not true and then it becomes very difficult for Facebook to say
[00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:07.120]   Well, we've decided this is true and that's not true. I don't want Facebook to be in that business
[00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:16.640]   They already sensor or I'm sorry. They already block things like that they block the napalm
[00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:23.600]   Was it the napalm kid story or photographs? Yeah, they block, you know, they used to block pictures of women breastfeeding
[00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:28.600]   They've I mean they've always been in that business. I feel like if you're a social network
[00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:33.640]   You're in the business of giving people letting people share the stuff they care about true or not
[00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:37.680]   Okay, can I just say one thing Facebook is hardly a social network anymore?
[00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:43.200]   The only thing you can't do share there is social stuff all you share is stupid
[00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:49.600]   New stories and fights with each other on politics. Well, then we should just all abandon Facebook. I
[00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:53.720]   But I gotta point out
[00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:56.280]   1.75 billion monthly active users
[00:40:56.280 --> 00:40:58.840]   I'm just saying I'm not gonna make it. I see Stacy
[00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:06.600]   I know they're not missing it, but I don't miss them either. They're optimizing for profit as every business does
[00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:14.080]   Yeah, and there is nothing wrong with optimizing for profit. I just think they they
[00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:21.120]   Can't run away from the responsibility. That's all I'm saying. I'm not disagreeing with you
[00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:24.440]   I'm and by the way, they can do censorship in China
[00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:28.160]   They have the systems to do locks they create a lot of things
[00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:32.800]   They don't like in China and and to say that they can block fake news
[00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:39.160]   I mean they get black real news in China if the we just revolt you're not gonna see it on Facebook in China
[00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:47.760]   Exactly. I was in China in 2009 watching CNN. They do this story about the weager rebellion
[00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:54.800]   CNN goes black for three minutes. That's it. Nothing's there and then it comes back on and I bet people in China
[00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:56.800]   Are used to that
[00:41:56.800 --> 00:42:02.920]   So it's a really good thing. It's not a good thing. Can we talk about some fun stuff?
[00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:04.680]   Yeah, we're gonna take a break now
[00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:11.000]   This is important stuff though and I know and I'm really glad that you and I'm just I'm pushing back a little bit because I don't
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:17.160]   I think it's important to have the full conversation on this absolutely. I just want to talk about fun stuff
[00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:23.760]   Why do you think I'm in this business? I started in talk radio talking politics. I started political talk radio
[00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:29.200]   Why do you think I'm here now? It's the last thing I want to do. I would go home every day with a stomachache
[00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:31.640]   Like I don't want to talk about this stuff
[00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:34.000]   Let's talk about smartphones
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:37.480]   Let's talk about virtual reality headgear
[00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:45.680]   Let's talk about our sponsor. I got optimized for profit sometimes - you know absolutely these Christmas decorations aren't cheap
[00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:48.440]   Exactly heck yeah
[00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:53.160]   My hipster grandpa sweater. That's that cost money. I was like that looks cat
[00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:59.680]   It is actually see you know what the great sadness of my life is my wife is allergic to cashmere
[00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:02.680]   How can that how can that be?
[00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:05.920]   Cashier buddies no
[00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:14.200]   Gorge it's goats, but but if they don't kill the goat they run through little bushes and the bushes capture the fuzz
[00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:22.040]   Extra excess not even fuzz they need excess fuzz as the goat runs through the bush and then they go out the case foot
[00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:25.780]   Absolutely the case. I'm like what kind of artisanal
[00:43:25.780 --> 00:43:32.040]   They just kind of shave the goats and then no no no not the good cashmere
[00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:35.320]   Really really
[00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:39.760]   Cashmere is the I think you should go look at it. See these goats
[00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:42.560]   these goats they run
[00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:45.360]   through the bushes and
[00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:49.800]   little fuzz balls come off of them and they're harvested and
[00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:52.880]   Made into the finest cashmere in the world
[00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:59.040]   In Gora, that's the buddies. Okay. Sorry. Yeah, that's a girl. That's something different. Oh, oh wait a minute
[00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:03.120]   Here they are sharing a cashmere a goat. Yeah, huh? All right. Who's your sponsor?
[00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:06.680]   It's not cashmere. I could tell you that right now
[00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:10.360]   our
[00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:14.040]   Where did I get well you should know it's from cashmere in India, right Dom?
[00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:18.000]   No, it's from Mongolia. Oh, it's Mongolia. Okay. I
[00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:23.080]   Thought it was from the cashmere region of India. No, this is those are not that great
[00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:28.360]   I think the ones from Mongolia are awesome. The ones from Mongolia is the one where the goats run through the bushes
[00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:30.360]   I'm pretty sure there are no bushes
[00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:43.560]   Like the first tech show without any tech no, it's coming. It's come we talked about Facebook
[00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:46.920]   That's tech we talked about the responsibilities Silicon Valley. That's tech
[00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:50.520]   Our show today brought to you by fresh books.com
[00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:55.400]   I had somebody asked me the other day for a better way to invoice
[00:44:55.400 --> 00:45:02.080]   His clients if you're a freelancer or a small business. You got to know about fresh books. This is the solution that I used for years
[00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:11.240]   But it's so much more than invoicing now the new fresh books really is cloud accounting the new fresh books dashboard tells you things that so many small businesses
[00:45:11.240 --> 00:45:14.320]   Don't know if you're a freelancer
[00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:18.720]   Can you tell me right off the bat if you were profitable this year? Can you tell me how profitable?
[00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:22.200]   Can you tell me what your expenses were who owes you money?
[00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:27.560]   What your accounts receivable are if you had fresh books you could you just go to the right to the front page and you'd know

[00:46:48.380 --> 00:46:51.680]   Fresh books comm
[00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:53.680]   slash twit oh
[00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:57.520]   Malick is here from om.co and pi.co pico

[00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:14.280]   I also now at the host of the IOT podcast IOT podcast calm
[00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:21.280]   Stacey on IOT is it gonna be an IOT Christmas Stacy and my house or just in general everywhere. Oh
[00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:27.320]   I hope so I really do but I kind of doubt it and yet at the same time
[00:47:27.320 --> 00:47:30.040]   I think there's a lot of security people who wish it wouldn't be right
[00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:34.000]   Right well the newer devices from credible people
[00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:36.880]   incredible vendors are
[00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:39.800]   Much more secure do not buy those
[00:47:39.800 --> 00:47:42.720]   cheap Chinese
[00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:45.640]   DVRs and cameras and
[00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:53.520]   Everyone should buy a router for Christmas this year a router that is over the air upgradable. Yes a modern one
[00:47:53.520 --> 00:48:00.160]   That's key that that doesn't have your passwords hard-coded the new Belkin links as routers are
[00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:07.480]   Okay, that way. I believe the new D links are but I haven't confirmed that you don't like the heroes and they're a sponsor
[00:48:07.480 --> 00:48:13.060]   But I but they didn't buy an ad today, but I just I that's an example of a router that is regularly updated
[00:48:13.060 --> 00:48:16.780]   Yes, they do everything right Google's doing the same thing now
[00:48:16.780 --> 00:48:21.640]   On hub on hub. There's the orbi from neck gear
[00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:28.060]   And actually I think wire cutter just said that was the best mesh networking router out there of the ones they had tried
[00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:30.900]   Well, I trust the wire you mean you said that
[00:48:30.900 --> 00:48:35.440]   Why I did not I was like I didn't do that particular review for the wire cutter
[00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:38.120]   You read for the wire cutter - I used to I I
[00:48:38.120 --> 00:48:42.720]   There they are they are so good with their reviews, but it's a very
[00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:49.920]   Constrained process it makes a great review, but it's hard to do there's a lot of spreadsheets. Well as it should be yes
[00:48:49.920 --> 00:48:56.800]   They were just bought by the New York Times by the way, so for 30 million nice job Brian lamb
[00:48:56.920 --> 00:48:59.000]   He can afford a bunch more orbeez
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:05.400]   Hey, I have a question for you on on the routers. I have the
[00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:14.000]   The apple router, which is the now abandoned abandoned, but is that a bad one to?
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:20.880]   No, you know one of the things about the apple router besides the fact that we're overpriced $200
[00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:22.880]   Is Apple did keep them up today?
[00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:29.320]   And they did avoid a lot of security pitfalls that other routers fell into like WPS, which was that push button
[00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:32.080]   Joining which was terrible
[00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:34.080]   flawed an apple doesn't do that
[00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:37.800]   But I think any router that's more than a couple of years old should be replaced
[00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:44.300]   They wear out the technology changes and I think there are much better choices out there now you're in a you're in an apartment, right?
[00:49:44.300 --> 00:49:45.360]   So
[00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:52.040]   Yeah, one router probably gets to every corner of the place right yeah, so you could keep using the apple router if it works for you
[00:49:52.520 --> 00:49:57.220]   Well, we'll see if they'll tell us how long I guess the question is how long would they keep updating their router?
[00:49:57.220 --> 00:50:00.680]   So they have not announced by the way they have not announced anything but
[00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:04.520]   Recoder somebody had the mark german had the story on
[00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:10.960]   Bloomberg that the entire team had been transferred to apple TV so that there's nobody working on it
[00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:16.040]   Maybe there's a skeleton team working on it. Yes. Maybe there maybe there maybe there becomes a router
[00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:18.600]   Yeah
[00:50:18.600 --> 00:50:22.160]   Just I think it's pretty clear looking at things like that
[00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:25.560]   People moving on that apple is really
[00:50:25.560 --> 00:50:33.000]   Refocusing on a few smaller number products. They've already said they are not gonna do any more displays and have pushed you to LG
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:35.000]   If you're gonna buy a display
[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:43.600]   I feel like apple is in the process right now saying we're gonna focus on and as they've always done a few a smaller number of products and
[00:50:43.600 --> 00:50:48.120]   And you know put all our as they as they would say in the financial press home
[00:50:48.360 --> 00:50:51.000]   Put more wood behind our arrows
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:57.840]   Anyway, if I put that in an article you would edit that right now you blue pencil that right out right Stacey
[00:50:57.840 --> 00:50:59.840]   I'd be like oh really
[00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:06.040]   Blue pension no red pension your bed pencil what's the blue pencils no pencils
[00:51:06.040 --> 00:51:13.680]   How long has it been since you've edited anything look at this when I graduated I can I can should I do blue or red?
[00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:21.240]   Let's do mm. I don't like that word. Okay. Let's let's put this in here. I can do that right?
[00:51:21.240 --> 00:51:25.640]   You know I didn't have that kind of
[00:51:25.640 --> 00:51:27.160]   I
[00:51:27.160 --> 00:51:31.320]   Need a better pencil, but I can choose you see I'll make it smaller. I'll make it bluer
[00:51:31.320 --> 00:51:35.080]   Yeah, does that transfer with your
[00:51:35.080 --> 00:51:41.600]   No, okay, we'll see now. I have to say that would be really exciting to you right there
[00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:45.080]   So what happens so this is actually kind of cool. This is the surface pro
[00:51:45.080 --> 00:51:49.520]   So I'm looking at a website a real live website if I double tap my pencil
[00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:55.880]   It turns it into an image which I can then annotate and I could save that out and send it to a Matthew and say Matthew
[00:51:55.880 --> 00:51:57.880]   I don't like this head
[00:51:57.880 --> 00:52:02.720]   But then he would hate you because you'd have to go back in and I go TK I
[00:52:02.720 --> 00:52:06.880]   Don't know and I don't know any of those things me so
[00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:10.480]   What were we talking about
[00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:16.600]   Wood and the day Apple I do think that the new mesh routers are better
[00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:23.240]   But you know but they're really for the solving the problem of congestion and spread so you don't have any trouble with your Wi-Fi
[00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:29.800]   Well, right now. No another Paul the Apple router is still perfectly secure and as far as I know will be for
[00:52:29.800 --> 00:52:33.280]   It's AC
[00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:38.840]   This is like one of those like the tall ones. Yeah airport straight is doing everything
[00:52:38.840 --> 00:52:43.960]   Oh, and yes, you have the one with a hard drive built. Yeah, yeah, okay the question
[00:52:43.960 --> 00:52:50.000]   I wanted to ask the two of you is I'm trying to figure out what is the best way to protect your
[00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:53.120]   personal information in a sense
[00:52:53.120 --> 00:52:57.400]   VPN and like encryption and all that kind of stuff
[00:52:57.400 --> 00:53:05.080]   Especially for somebody like me who travels a bunch. Yeah, what's the right way to do this? Yeah without like adding too much overhead
[00:53:05.720 --> 00:53:10.440]   In terms of like, you know slowing down the machine and stuff your screw-dome
[00:53:10.440 --> 00:53:15.880]   Yeah, because anytime you come back into the country they can just take your stuff. They can't so
[00:53:15.880 --> 00:53:18.520]   Obviously encryption is your friend, right?
[00:53:18.520 --> 00:53:24.160]   In fact notice that since the election for the downloads of signal the encrypted messenger
[00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:28.040]   From open systems has have quadrupled
[00:53:28.040 --> 00:53:30.000]   so
[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:35.600]   Clearly there are people and I would it may also be related frankly to the passage of the investigatory power is acting the
[00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:37.240]   UK
[00:53:37.240 --> 00:53:38.680]   That may have been a
[00:53:38.680 --> 00:53:44.000]   Precipitating factor - I I at this point. I don't feel like here in the United States. We have any more
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:50.520]   Issue with privacy than we've always had you know, I'm talking about all these family is another issue. Yeah
[00:53:50.520 --> 00:53:57.640]   Yeah, where are you talking about people like hackers trying to get to your data? Yeah, so here's what I would do
[00:53:57.640 --> 00:54:04.040]   And this is actually what I use there's a little device called the tiny hardware firewall and
[00:54:04.680 --> 00:54:09.600]   You can buy it. It's not very expensive. It's a you it's it fits on your key chain. See then it's a USB
[00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:12.640]   key
[00:54:12.640 --> 00:54:16.160]   What this is is it's a built-in VPN and Tor
[00:54:16.160 --> 00:54:20.840]   They actually have bigger devices - if you want, but this little you this thing
[00:54:20.840 --> 00:54:23.600]   I would you could put this in you know in your laptop bag
[00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:27.840]   Whenever you're in an open Wi-Fi access point you plug this into the USB port
[00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:31.880]   It picks up the Wi-Fi signal from the coffee shop
[00:54:32.800 --> 00:54:36.720]   Passes it through a VPN and or Tor depending on what you want
[00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:45.240]   To your computer so that your computer is now on a VPN and or Tor the whole time you're using it in the coffee shop
[00:54:45.240 --> 00:54:47.280]   Which absolutely is more secure
[00:54:47.280 --> 00:54:55.600]   Okay, this also has optional malware blocking and ad blocking if you want to turn that on as well
[00:54:55.600 --> 00:55:00.880]   So basically it's like a filtration system. Yeah, I have I have one of them here
[00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:06.320]   I just got this is this is a same people tiny hardware firewall.com that do this is a router
[00:55:06.320 --> 00:55:10.640]   So this is a little portable router. You see as the Wi-Fi and the ethernet
[00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:15.720]   The safest thing to do would be turn off the Wi-Fi in your laptop entirely
[00:55:15.720 --> 00:55:18.360]   So that you're not an attack surface at all
[00:55:18.360 --> 00:55:24.400]   Put this on your laptop have it get the Wi-Fi signal and then go into your laptop via ethernet
[00:55:24.400 --> 00:55:28.840]   And then your laptop is truly not an attack surface, okay?
[00:55:29.120 --> 00:55:32.640]   You want to use anything that goes out of your laptop is going through VPN
[00:55:32.640 --> 00:55:38.720]   I don't know if you want an anonymizer not Tor is you know as we know the FBI has cracked Tor and
[00:55:38.720 --> 00:55:41.000]   Tor may not be perfectly anonymizing
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:44.120]   But it's better than nothing
[00:55:44.120 --> 00:55:52.160]   And then you probably want to use encryption on your email and that means GPG not proton mail or something like that
[00:55:52.160 --> 00:55:58.680]   Do you use a PGP or GPG? I use GPG. Yeah
[00:55:58.680 --> 00:56:04.400]   And that so that means you have to use an email client that supports GPG apples mail does
[00:56:04.400 --> 00:56:09.400]   If you go to a GPG tools.org that's for the Mac
[00:56:09.400 --> 00:56:14.000]   And you get the GPG suite it doesn't currently work with the Sierra version of mail
[00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:20.880]   But it works with other clients including Thunderbird which is available on every platform if you're on Windows you go to GPG for win
[00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:26.760]   That will also it's installs easily if you do the art
[00:56:26.760 --> 00:56:29.560]   It'd be hard I
[00:56:29.560 --> 00:56:35.840]   Need to buy a Windows machine that well don't do that. Yeah, I wouldn't recommend it and then
[00:56:35.840 --> 00:56:39.400]   So now your email is encrypted because otherwise it's a postcard
[00:56:39.400 --> 00:56:42.120]   It's encrypted
[00:56:42.120 --> 00:56:47.800]   Your web browsing is encrypted if you don't have your Wi-Fi turn on your laptop
[00:56:47.800 --> 00:56:53.240]   An attacker would have to have physical access to your hardware. That's you know, they don't have that right?
[00:56:53.640 --> 00:56:58.640]   Don't let them have that I wouldn't carry around a smartphone with you or if you do carry around a smartphone
[00:56:58.640 --> 00:57:00.640]   That's not connected any of your accounts
[00:57:00.640 --> 00:57:06.040]   Because because this is a real in fact look at the latest story on Android
[00:57:06.040 --> 00:57:11.000]   There's a real problem they call it Gooligan
[00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:16.720]   Which is that a Dutch story that was scary. It's a little scary
[00:57:18.600 --> 00:57:23.560]   Millions of accounts being compromised and more thousands more every day as we speak
[00:57:23.560 --> 00:57:31.280]   86 apps now the problem is you notice it says third party app stores
[00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:38.160]   So one way to avoid this is to not go anywhere, but Google's Play Store nevertheless stuff is snuck into Google's Play Store in the past
[00:57:38.160 --> 00:57:44.440]   This takes advantage of a flaw in earlier versions of Android you that's the other thing is make sure you use
[00:57:44.920 --> 00:57:48.920]   The latest versions of Android this affects versions 4 in version 5
[00:57:48.920 --> 00:57:53.800]   through lollipops, so if you're using marshmallow or
[00:57:53.800 --> 00:58:01.160]   Well a lot of the carriers and stuff have they know a lot of these cheap phones
[00:58:01.160 --> 00:58:05.700]   Yeah, you know you buy a phone for $40
[00:58:05.700 --> 00:58:11.120]   It's not going to be updated the carriers not going to update it the manufacturers not going to update it
[00:58:11.120 --> 00:58:18.640]   You're going to be using whatever version it came with and so that's why so many people are vulnerable is because the vast majority of Android devices are running old
[00:58:18.640 --> 00:58:20.400]   versions of Android
[00:58:20.400 --> 00:58:26.680]   So is it okay then that we basically have bifurcated people like folks who can pay for security or
[00:58:26.680 --> 00:58:33.800]   Text it's expensive. Yeah, I mean isn't that interesting because we basically just told people will pay up dude
[00:58:33.800 --> 00:58:36.360]   Don't buy cheap not the people who are most vulnerable
[00:58:36.360 --> 00:58:39.800]   Are the ones we're getting attacked
[00:58:40.120 --> 00:58:42.640]   Right as is often the case. Yeah
[00:58:42.640 --> 00:58:45.680]   Well, and I think I mean
[00:58:45.680 --> 00:58:52.400]   I think I'm not wrong that in a lot of countries where there isn't a great banking infrastructure the smartphone is the bank
[00:58:52.400 --> 00:58:56.040]   and after with empesa and things like that and I
[00:58:56.040 --> 00:58:59.720]   Mean I mean you're just hell you're very vulnerable
[00:58:59.720 --> 00:59:07.640]   I don't know what security measures are in place for that sort of thing and like with empesa, right I
[00:59:08.360 --> 00:59:13.680]   Think Google needs to just take control of Android. Well, that's what that's what they're trying to do with pixel
[00:59:13.680 --> 00:59:15.680]   But it's a $800 phone
[00:59:15.680 --> 00:59:22.640]   No, no, no, I mean no more Android OS open source, right bring it back into Google
[00:59:22.640 --> 00:59:26.520]   Maybe that's the solution the iPhone is not that iPhone doesn't have problems
[00:59:26.520 --> 00:59:30.800]   But they have far fewer problems on iOS at least there is one place where you can fight them
[00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:36.960]   Mm-hmm, right and they own the whole infrastructure. That's the other benefit they have
[00:59:37.960 --> 00:59:41.840]   They've got it. Don't bring it up with Leo. He's gonna lose his
[00:59:41.840 --> 00:59:49.520]   You have a very low opinion of me, don't you you and Mac do not get long. I like Apple
[00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:56.720]   I'm not complaining about Apple. I love it last five times. I mean I've been on your show. We should just do this
[00:59:56.720 --> 01:00:05.000]   That it's been a rancid ranks about Apple. So you know what I just want to I just want to have a happy time
[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.600]   I'm mad at Apple because I love Apple so much
[01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:13.160]   Isn't it the case you always hurt the one you love I heard that in a song once
[01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:16.040]   You listen to a lot of country music
[01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:21.400]   Oh, I just bought tickets to go see Willie Nelson. That is it. I'm excited
[01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:28.200]   That's not country music. That is folk music of a man. It is the people's music. It is awesome. I'm so pumped
[01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:30.960]   Okay, I have been in Willie Nelson's bus
[01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:33.760]   Were you smoking weed?
[01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:38.760]   If you get in the bus doesn't matter whether you're smoking weed or not you just breathe and you're smoking weed
[01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:43.520]   I literally they opened the door to the bus and smoke pours out
[01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:49.600]   And I got in and he gave me a bottle of old whiskey river and a red bandana
[01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:52.800]   And I even held his guitar
[01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:58.320]   Which I apparently was bad etiquette, but I did it anyway. How long ago was this hundred years ago?
[01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:08.120]   It was it was he was a guest on tech TV actually so it would have been on the on the what did you call it the best screen savers?
[01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:11.360]   No, the real screen for real screen savers
[01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:15.560]   This is the new screen savers. Why did you call it the new screen because it's new?
[01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:20.840]   So we would because by the way, we don't have to call it the new screen savers. We have the trademark
[01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:25.760]   It's called the new real screen savers new, but it was real, but now it's the fake
[01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:28.360]   Yeah
[01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:32.000]   I gotta come on that show that is my dream show come on that show
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:36.360]   book Oh on the on the fake screen savers would you
[01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:45.960]   You're more than welcome anytime we would love that talk talk and post office customers hit by the Mirai worm
[01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:49.200]   We thought this was over Mirai as a worm that attacks
[01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:51.040]   routers
[01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:55.760]   Deutsche Telekom 900 thousand customers with the Mirai worm
[01:01:56.480 --> 01:02:03.840]   Post office is a British is the British ISP talk talk another British ISP hit by the Mirai worm because their routers
[01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:06.440]   We're not
[01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:07.940]   patched
[01:02:07.940 --> 01:02:12.560]   Well, actually that's that's not quite with the Deutsche Telekom
[01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:14.720]   they actually saw that
[01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:20.120]   Folks were using Mirai and tried to patch it and when they did the attempted patch
[01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:25.200]   They did it all at once and they bricked a bunch of devices. It was an expertly applied. So
[01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:28.160]   They were they were trying
[01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:33.080]   It was a worldwide attack on selected remote management ports of DSL routers
[01:02:33.080 --> 01:02:38.880]   There are 20 million Deutsche Telekom customers in Germany. Oh a mere 900 thousand
[01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:41.640]   got Mirai
[01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:44.220]   But they they now have put another patch out
[01:02:44.220 --> 01:02:48.320]   I guess that works and advise users to reboot to clear the virus
[01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:52.840]   So you say was this after this story that that they did the patch or is this
[01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:56.360]   No, this was the original story. We talked about it on our show
[01:02:56.360 --> 01:03:00.400]   Earlier this week on the real Stacy and I
[01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:03.280]   But the real true
[01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:06.240]   That is Iot podcast so
[01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:13.040]   You know, I think there is got to be a rule against the companies who don't who don't do this property security
[01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:15.040]   I think if your job is to provide
[01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:19.760]   internet access or banking if they are
[01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:22.640]   unable to provide protection and
[01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:25.240]   encryption of data
[01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:29.440]   They should they should be heavily penalized for it. Yeah, okay
[01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:35.000]   So here's an interesting thought because I had a dude. Okay, so there's a the broadband internet
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:40.280]   Technical advisory group actually put out a report last week talking about this and
[01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:42.840]   Part of it was the role of ISPs
[01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:49.600]   So the challenge they face with securing their routers and we can argue about this. I it'll be fun
[01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:54.520]   Is that if they block these attacks what happens is or if they block?
[01:03:54.520 --> 01:04:00.200]   You know certain whenever they block anything or close off a port on a router
[01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:04.240]   They get a technical support call. Oh, yeah, it's hugely expensive for the big ISPs
[01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:10.000]   So they're like ah it costs a lot of money. Right now the downside now though is people are like with Mariah
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:17.560]   X number of their routers might be compromised easily. So then they're like is it more expensive to do it this way or that way, right?
[01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:21.240]   Well for one to be like proactively looking to
[01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:27.580]   block these things even before the attacks arise in a sense part of their you know
[01:04:27.580 --> 01:04:31.000]   Op X should be devoted entirely to
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:37.080]   Fixing the problem before they it's sort of like, you know very much like the medical system where we have
[01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:41.120]   You know, oh you can go to the hospital after you've fallen sick
[01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:42.400]   It's the same thing
[01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:47.440]   It's like but we try to close the door after the frickin horses, you know, you know
[01:04:47.720 --> 01:04:54.880]   Bolted like why would you do that like why not try and you know provide provide ways to not cause problems?
[01:04:54.880 --> 01:05:02.360]   You know already and I think that's what I mean is like if your job is to manage people's identity people's
[01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:06.240]   Internet access people's banking you should be like
[01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:08.800]   the ultra edge of
[01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:11.760]   You know preventing these attacks not if only that would true
[01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:17.120]   It was yeah, yeah, I think they're coming into like I expect
[01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:19.280]   Most I I mean
[01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:21.440]   Now go for it
[01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:28.600]   I like the word by the way and I know you you said proactive, but I thought you said bro active and I think they should be
[01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:30.600]   bro active
[01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:32.920]   What is that even
[01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:37.920]   When the new router
[01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:40.160]   All right, bro
[01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:46.560]   I was gonna say sorry go ahead that they were
[01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:51.560]   They are looking at doing new routers, but it's a pain to do a customer
[01:05:51.560 --> 01:05:55.280]   customer premise equipment, you know replacing millions of
[01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:58.000]   pieces of equipment at people's houses is
[01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:03.600]   Arjuna senior always gonna get these people who are like I like this it works just fine
[01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:10.680]   Comcast very famously, you know internet service providers hate it when you have a email
[01:06:10.680 --> 01:06:14.440]   server running at home and
[01:06:14.680 --> 01:06:18.920]   They're often put there by malware to send out spam
[01:06:18.920 --> 01:06:24.200]   That was a big problem for years and the solution was very simple which was merely the blockport 25
[01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:27.320]   the the SMTP port and
[01:06:27.320 --> 01:06:31.920]   Comcast resisted for years because they said and you know when you have millions of customers
[01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:36.280]   This makes sense that they would get millions of phone calls it would cost them millions of dollars
[01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:44.600]   If they did it they eventually did it though, and this is the point they had to and I think that you're gonna get resistance from these
[01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:49.880]   Companies saying well, that's expensive, but I think you're right home is hold their feet to the fire
[01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:53.720]   So you have a responsibility if you're making equipment that's on the network
[01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:56.520]   To keep to preserve the network
[01:06:56.520 --> 01:07:02.680]   Isn't that what my bail used to say with the right before the Carter decision my bail said well
[01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:07.600]   You can't put just any old equipment on the network because we got a preserved network integrity course they lost that case
[01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:12.160]   That's what any IS or any cellular provider says about their network to yeah
[01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:15.520]   Apple says
[01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:18.360]   Apple tried to tell the librarian of Congress. It would be illegal
[01:07:18.360 --> 01:07:25.160]   To jailbreak an iPhone because that would make them you know hackers have access to the cell towers
[01:07:25.160 --> 01:07:31.000]   Oh there you go again
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:34.960]   All right, no no, here's some good news
[01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:42.720]   JD power released a new study today saying that the airport extreme has number one number one customer
[01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:48.720]   This faction that's why they shut it down. That's why they what that's why they shut it down, baby
[01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:55.320]   It's easy and now all these other companies are coming in and they're trying to do exactly that
[01:07:55.320 --> 01:07:58.400]   I mean if you install a couple of years and I think euro and
[01:07:58.400 --> 01:08:04.200]   Luma and warby and all these the on hub these are gonna be the future I
[01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:09.400]   Think because yes, there's so much easier to set up and manipulate and deal with it's a little weird
[01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:13.280]   In fact, I asked euro about this because in order to use the euro router
[01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:16.560]   You have to create an euro account either tied to your cell phone or your email
[01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:18.440]   And I said well, why do I have to do that?
[01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:23.960]   That means now you're associated all the traffic on this router with me personally and they said well
[01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:26.440]   Yeah, we'll protect your privacy, etc, etc
[01:08:26.440 --> 01:08:30.600]   But the reason we do that is so that we can update it for security
[01:08:30.600 --> 01:08:32.920]   Having an account
[01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:38.040]   allows us to you know kind of improve your router specifically your router
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:43.480]   And the other thing at the same time in the past my Asus router didn't know who I was right?
[01:08:43.480 --> 01:08:49.880]   Well, but your ISP knows who you were and the IP address. I mean, I know we could we could still
[01:08:49.880 --> 01:08:54.520]   Continue those arguments. I always say that when people complain about Google knowing too much about us
[01:08:54.520 --> 01:09:00.840]   They forget Google what about your ISP at least Google, you know is a publicly held company and people are paying attention to it
[01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:07.000]   Nobody cares your ISP could do anything it wants in fact if you're in England your ISP is mandated to keep track of everything
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:13.800]   You do and offer it at any time to any British authority including the food safety authorities
[01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:20.840]   I was gonna say there's a pro side to euro having your account
[01:09:20.840 --> 01:09:29.880]   Nick weaver the CEO of euro he had told me originally that when they made the when they started deploying their beta units
[01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:34.360]   People kept putting in terrible passwords like password one two three, right?
[01:09:34.520 --> 01:09:37.800]   And so he changed the whole system. He was like screw it
[01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:41.080]   We're gonna do this like double opt or two factor of a sort
[01:09:41.080 --> 01:09:47.160]   So now you have to ask when you log into your account you give them your email address or your phone number and then you get a
[01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:53.080]   Email or a text and then you enter that code and then you can log on. So they're really trying
[01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:59.320]   They're using that to make things more secure. I think so he told me the same thing and it convinced me of the value of
[01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:01.000]   of doing
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:04.840]   Here are the authorities allowed to access without warrant
[01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:10.120]   In the UK your internet connection records like every site you visited over the last year
[01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:15.320]   Of course the police forces of London, Scotland, Northern Ireland the British transport police
[01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:22.200]   The secret intelligence service gchq of course administrative defense, but the department of health
[01:10:22.200 --> 01:10:26.600]   Ooh the gambling commission because the gambling commission the lottery ads you could get
[01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:33.400]   The I mean this look at this last he goes on and on and on the gangmasters and labor abuse authority
[01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:35.400]   the
[01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:37.960]   The information commissioner. I don't even know who that is
[01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:45.480]   the ombudsman police ombudsman for Northern Ireland the Scottish ambulance service board
[01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:54.600]   But the best one is the food standards agency I think you know if you are you violating food standards
[01:10:54.600 --> 01:10:57.320]   Or let's check your let's check your surf history
[01:10:57.320 --> 01:11:00.200]   And just just to make sure
[01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:04.600]   Anyway, that was good news your JD power says you got the best router should be happy home
[01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:10.440]   You don't have to buy a new one. I'm happy about that. I think it's okay
[01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:16.040]   You'll be fine. It's Stockholm syndrome. Anybody who paid $200 for an apple router is going to think it's the best route
[01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:22.920]   I didn't say that I just asked you what should I do? Are you getting any iCloud calendar spam?
[01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:28.600]   Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, like offers to buy Ray ban sunglasses
[01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:33.960]   Totally. Yeah showing up in your calendar. This is a apples acknowledge the problem
[01:11:33.960 --> 01:11:40.040]   They're saying we're sorry some of our users are receiving spam calendar invitations some of our users. I think everybody
[01:11:40.040 --> 01:11:45.560]   We're actively working to address this issue by identifying and blocking suspicious centers and spam
[01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:48.200]   What they're not doing is changing the mechanism that allows
[01:11:49.160 --> 01:11:58.920]   Any rando to put a calendar event in your calendar? I think it's just like one of the things that you need to learn to decode what apple says
[01:11:58.920 --> 01:12:01.560]   And what apple means?
[01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:05.320]   Some means a lot of people are getting that's the word
[01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:11.880]   Some I mean, that's like I the only challenge I have with apple is that none of the apple bloggers
[01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:17.160]   Called them out on things. Yeah, that's what I that's what i'm trying to do. Boom. I'm just trying to be honest
[01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:21.560]   But like there is there is calling them out and disliking them. I don't dislike them
[01:12:21.560 --> 01:12:24.760]   I love apple
[01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:28.120]   I'm like granny apples or the other one. No, I love me
[01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:30.840]   You know what I bought a mac in the first hundred days
[01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:34.600]   I went to macy's and I charged it for
[01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:38.840]   $2,500 and I've owned every max since I even bought that silly
[01:12:38.840 --> 01:12:44.680]   Mac with the oled touch bar on it. That's how much you like you want to get rid of it
[01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:47.160]   I'll buy it from you. You know you just well
[01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:53.240]   No, I'm gonna keep using it, but the old led touch bar. That's kind of goofy. I like the fingerprint thing the touch ID is good
[01:12:53.240 --> 01:12:58.920]   But I thought if you hated it, I could take it. I don't hate it. I love it. It's my little laptop
[01:12:58.920 --> 01:13:03.240]   See, but I think no no new surface for you
[01:13:03.240 --> 01:13:07.800]   What do you think this is?
[01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:11.960]   What do you think this is? Stop standpoint. Oh, no, I have the old surface book. I think that's fine
[01:13:11.960 --> 01:13:17.240]   I'm not a Windows fan either. You know, I I think you probably don't understand. I hate technology
[01:13:17.240 --> 01:13:20.280]   That's why I got in this business. Yeah
[01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:28.440]   Why you like the real natural bonker margin? I am I didn't used to be but then I started working with john c to vorek and he rubbed off
[01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:32.280]   Okay
[01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:34.280]   I blame him
[01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:40.360]   No, I you know what I used to be way too positive about technology, but ultimately here's the truth
[01:13:41.240 --> 01:13:45.160]   My job is not to cheerlead for any technology or technology company
[01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:47.160]   but to
[01:13:47.160 --> 01:13:50.840]   cheerlead for users I'm a user I want to represent the user's interests
[01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:55.080]   And if something's not working for people then we could do better, right?
[01:13:55.080 --> 01:13:58.600]   You and Stacy both right we're for the user right?
[01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:05.400]   Right. Well consumer. Yes. Yeah, people are for the people not the user or the consumer
[01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:08.040]   those are negative terms
[01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:09.400]   What
[01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:11.400]   He's not any kind of user
[01:14:11.400 --> 01:14:18.280]   Like if you spend a hundred to a couple thousand dollars on something should work and it should yes, thank you
[01:14:18.280 --> 01:14:24.200]   That is called iot the entire ecosystem you buy things and they keep piling up
[01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:28.040]   Never worry. So I have a couple things that work, but yeah, you're right
[01:14:28.040 --> 01:14:32.840]   I I took someone to task. I took august to task this week on the show because I was so
[01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:34.760]   frustrated

[01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:34.360]   It could be so good. It could be a hundred weeks

[01:20:58.040 --> 01:21:03.400]   I mean every major executive these days has an office of the executive that includes a bunch of people
[01:21:03.800 --> 01:21:07.640]   whose sole job it is to send these canned responses to email, right
[01:21:07.640 --> 01:21:13.320]   I even have that I have about 15 people answer my email. Whoa, you must be

[01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:24.280]   No, in fact, I've got a new method. I ignore all emails
[01:21:24.280 --> 01:21:30.120]   It's true. He's never responded to what am I and I've only sent him to in the entire six months. I've known him
[01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:36.840]   I should respond. I'm sorry. I found yours the other day. I was searching for something and I saw one from you and I said, oh
[01:21:36.840 --> 01:21:43.400]   Stacey sent me an email four weeks ago. I told you that I said it was a very nice email

[01:21:52.680 --> 01:21:57.480]   No, no, it's not it. I wouldn't have time to sit in the studio by myself. I'd be busy answering email
[01:21:57.480 --> 01:21:59.560]   What do you mean by myself? You're here?
[01:22:00.280 --> 01:22:06.760]   In virtual reality? No, can you smell my nice cologne? No, what kind of cologne are you wearing?
[01:22:06.760 --> 01:22:09.160]   That doesn't matter since you can't smell it
[01:22:09.160 --> 01:22:11.880]   frankly
[01:22:11.880 --> 01:22:14.760]   Mainly the reason we don't have people in studios. So I don't have to smell them
[01:22:14.760 --> 01:22:23.240]   I don't know what you are all the other way around like, you know, I have no I don't smell at all
[01:22:23.240 --> 01:22:26.760]   You must be sweating under that sweater. No smell
[01:22:27.720 --> 01:22:32.840]   I use products that have no smell you put the sweat in the sweater, man. Come on
[01:22:32.840 --> 01:22:37.400]   Are you wearing perfume stacey?
[01:22:37.400 --> 01:22:44.760]   No, no, but I cooked I spent three hours cooking a a beef kind of stew thing with bacon and wine and
[01:22:44.760 --> 01:22:47.000]   deglazing and onions
[01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:51.320]   So I smell like deliciousness, but probably not oh you don't smell like deliciousness
[01:22:51.320 --> 01:22:56.840]   You smell like old sofa cushions. You think you smell like deliciousness everything in my house smells like this right now
[01:22:57.800 --> 01:23:04.520]   When I we every time I barbecue my hair gets smoked and then I smell like that for a day. I hate it. Okay barbecue smoke
[01:23:04.520 --> 01:23:07.320]   Is totally different than bacon
[01:23:07.320 --> 01:23:10.520]   I smell like bacon
[01:23:10.520 --> 01:23:12.840]   Bacon's pretty good
[01:23:12.840 --> 01:23:16.840]   You stacey you and I are not getting invited back to the show. I love you guys
[01:23:16.840 --> 01:23:22.040]   No, if I could in fact, I would fire everybody else and it would just be these you two every week
[01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:24.520]   Talking about how you might get your wish
[01:23:26.440 --> 01:23:30.280]   You lost your audience right now. No, no, they love you
[01:23:30.280 --> 01:23:34.120]   Except for that one guy who says who is this ome guy? He seems to know nothing
[01:23:34.120 --> 01:23:37.080]   There's a lot of people like that
[01:23:37.080 --> 01:23:41.400]   They don't know how deep the ome river is
[01:23:41.400 --> 01:23:46.520]   Really is it yeah, you're the marionis trench of tech journalists
[01:23:46.520 --> 01:23:51.000]   Okay, let me talk about tag, please
[01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:54.040]   Hey, let's talk about net neutrality, please
[01:23:55.160 --> 01:23:57.800]   Yes, stacey wants to talk about net new i want to talk about
[01:23:57.800 --> 01:24:02.520]   All right, so this is a good one. I really enjoyed this article the fcc
[01:24:02.520 --> 01:24:05.400]   came up with the opinion that atnt
[01:24:05.400 --> 01:24:08.600]   and their new direct tv
[01:24:08.600 --> 01:24:10.360]   now
[01:24:10.360 --> 01:24:12.360]   violates net neutrality
[01:24:12.360 --> 01:24:16.120]   Uh because of course atnt says
[01:24:16.120 --> 01:24:20.840]   We're not going to charge you for bandwidth you use when you watch direct tv now
[01:24:21.480 --> 01:24:25.400]   on as an atnt customer zero rating, right
[01:24:25.400 --> 01:24:28.520]   But there's a little problem
[01:24:28.520 --> 01:24:29.720]   like
[01:24:29.720 --> 01:24:33.640]   The fcc is the ultimate lame duck agency at this point
[01:24:33.640 --> 01:24:36.600]   In uh in a few weeks january 20th
[01:24:36.600 --> 01:24:43.480]   The new president will get to nominate a new chairman of the fcc in fact congress has already said to the fcc
[01:24:43.480 --> 01:24:46.200]   Don't do anything
[01:24:46.200 --> 01:24:50.280]   Well, and the fcc is already yes, they stopped they stopped doing stuff
[01:24:50.280 --> 01:24:52.280]   So this must be like a leftover
[01:24:52.280 --> 01:24:59.640]   Well, yes, and this is something I mean tom wheeler is banking big on net neutrality being his
[01:24:59.640 --> 01:25:05.960]   Actually protecting consumers rights, which he's done a really good job of he is not the dingo that we thought he was
[01:25:05.960 --> 01:25:08.440]   He is he is not
[01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:15.240]   So yeah, this is so frustrating because this is what everyone said was going to happen when we allowed zero rating
[01:25:15.240 --> 01:25:17.880]   This is not a surprise to anyone. Yeah, and
[01:25:19.800 --> 01:25:21.800]   oh look it's happening and
[01:25:21.800 --> 01:25:25.160]   atnt and verizon by
[01:25:25.160 --> 01:25:32.360]   By ignoring t-mobile and not going after the the first mover the weakest one in that because t-mobile started this with their binge
[01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:38.280]   On program binge on and zero rating for spotify and some things whichever is like hey free spotify
[01:25:38.280 --> 01:25:43.880]   We're like no, this is like this is why it's so hard zero rating is so hard because customers love it
[01:25:44.680 --> 01:25:50.920]   Right what they don't understand and it's I feel like i'm preaching at them when I say this is
[01:25:50.920 --> 01:25:53.640]   You it's not good for you
[01:25:53.640 --> 01:25:58.920]   You shouldn't I know you're not paying anything for listening to spotify
[01:25:58.920 --> 01:26:04.040]   But the problem is the next hot new exciting music service
[01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:10.840]   Is disadvantaged you won't listen to them because they cost you bandwidth so in effect you're telling
[01:26:11.320 --> 01:26:16.200]   John ledger and and t-mobile you guys get to pick who the winners are
[01:26:16.200 --> 01:26:24.040]   And we don't want t-mobile to pick who the winners are we don't want 18 t to pick who the winners are we want the market
[01:26:24.040 --> 01:26:26.440]   And consumers to pick who the winners are
[01:26:26.440 --> 01:26:32.360]   Did I describe that accurately you were so good i'm so glad I didn't have to do that because I would have just got
[01:26:32.360 --> 01:26:35.640]   Part of the problem is the is the term net neutrality is terrible
[01:26:38.280 --> 01:26:44.200]   Yes, and I wish we could come up with a better name. I keep thinking maybe net discrimination or bandwidth discrimination
[01:26:44.200 --> 01:26:49.320]   Network freedom. Well, it's for freedom, but it's against discrimination
[01:26:49.320 --> 01:26:53.800]   It's yeah, but discrimination they the they got that
[01:26:53.800 --> 01:27:00.680]   They took advantage of that word because discrimination in the fcc since now means a lot of crazy things, but on this story
[01:27:00.680 --> 01:27:05.880]   So atnt with direct tv that's their own service
[01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:12.280]   So they're basically like oh you belong to us and that's why the fcc went after them
[01:27:12.280 --> 01:27:18.280]   So with t-mobile t-mobile wasn't being is egregious. Well, it is it's worse. It's worse today. It is way worse
[01:27:18.280 --> 01:27:23.080]   Yes, but it's not really worse because ultimately the whole problem is
[01:27:23.080 --> 01:27:26.520]   Picking winners whether it's you or somebody else
[01:27:26.520 --> 01:27:34.200]   And we don't know what deals t-mobiles making with these companies to get zero rated zero rating is it by the way another terrible phrase
[01:27:34.360 --> 01:27:37.080]   These phrases are chosen to obfuscate the problem
[01:27:37.080 --> 01:27:41.240]   Because the people in their marketing departments are great
[01:27:41.240 --> 01:27:44.040]   atnt sponsored data
[01:27:44.040 --> 01:27:46.520]   so with this
[01:27:46.520 --> 01:27:49.320]   I'm just i'm so sad because
[01:27:49.320 --> 01:27:55.640]   Atnt even if the fcc does go even if the fcc had the ability to go after them
[01:27:55.640 --> 01:27:59.720]   Which I don't think given the people who are in trumps transition team that's going to happen
[01:27:59.720 --> 01:28:03.880]   Atnt and Verizon will fight like hell to make sure this goes through
[01:28:04.360 --> 01:28:09.400]   And they fight the long game. I mean the fact that we're still talking about net neutrality
[01:28:09.400 --> 01:28:15.480]   How how long has it been since we've been doing net neutrality like 2008 2009?
[01:28:15.480 --> 01:28:19.320]   I mean before 2005 was the term was invented or
[01:28:19.320 --> 01:28:26.520]   I've been writing about this since day one and it's so nice to see two other people talk about
[01:28:26.520 --> 01:28:28.600]   stuff with
[01:28:28.600 --> 01:28:30.600]   you know made my head explode
[01:28:31.800 --> 01:28:34.920]   I just uh signed up for the free trial of direct tv now
[01:28:34.920 --> 01:28:38.760]   And it's supposed to be a free seven day trial
[01:28:38.760 --> 01:28:45.080]   But the the pro I wish I could show you I should I maybe I've hustled through this. Oh, yeah, here we go. So
[01:28:45.080 --> 01:28:51.240]   This is supposed to be free, but and it's very confusing lock it in pay 35 dollars every month
[01:28:51.240 --> 01:28:54.520]   Well, what no wait a minute. I don't should I place the continue button or no?
[01:28:54.520 --> 01:29:01.000]   What am I paying for add to plan? But I don't it's supposed to be free. Okay continue prepay will hook you up
[01:29:01.080 --> 01:29:07.800]   No, what I supposed to be free. Oh wait a minute. This is free prepay three months today. It's free right credit card
[01:29:07.800 --> 01:29:09.880]   I'm not giving you what the hell
[01:29:09.880 --> 01:29:12.840]   So this is by the way
[01:29:12.840 --> 01:29:17.880]   Just if case you think oh no 18 t's nice. They wouldn't screw anybody. No when thinks that oh
[01:29:17.880 --> 01:29:25.160]   I can't continue without giving him a credit card. Well, that's so that's pretty common on free total due to the wait wait wait wait
[01:29:25.160 --> 01:29:30.760]   Total due today a hundred five dollars. That's common on free trials. Oh, that is not that is not
[01:29:30.920 --> 01:29:34.840]   Total due today a hundred five dollars. That's wait a minute. This is time
[01:29:34.840 --> 01:29:39.880]   It's time for me to make this big and uh and to use my illustrator
[01:29:39.880 --> 01:29:45.960]   Total due today a hundred and five dollars due today. That's not free
[01:29:45.960 --> 01:29:52.440]   Scroll down. I want to see their t and c because a t and t has the best you are weird if you want to see that
[01:29:52.440 --> 01:29:55.960]   Okay. Well, all right. No, that's when they're going to tell you what you're paying for
[01:29:56.760 --> 01:30:00.120]   compatible device and browser required residential customers only available in the us
[01:30:00.120 --> 01:30:03.880]   So the free trial part free trial new subscribers only cancel before the end of trial
[01:30:03.880 --> 01:30:07.560]   So which is on a map you renews monthly at the right effective sign up minimum $35 a month

[01:30:11.160 --> 01:30:13.160]   TV now once cancel you can go directly
[01:30:13.160 --> 01:30:19.880]   But but okay, but wait wait wait wait wait wait wait total due today. This is not free
[01:30:21.480 --> 01:30:25.480]   hundred five dollars. How did it get to that? Yeah, where did that come from?
[01:30:25.480 --> 01:30:30.520]   Your seven free days we've added to the end of your free
[01:30:30.520 --> 01:30:32.520]   Wait a minute
[01:30:32.520 --> 01:30:36.280]   Your seven day will be added to the end of your prepaid period
[01:30:36.280 --> 01:30:39.000]   You'll be charged a hundred five dollars today
[01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:43.800]   And your regularly monthly payments of 35 dollars a month will start on march 11th
[01:30:43.800 --> 01:30:47.640]   That's not free
[01:30:47.640 --> 01:30:49.640]   That's what they found on that
[01:30:49.640 --> 01:30:54.280]   I love them. There you go. We just need your info
[01:30:54.280 --> 01:30:57.640]   Give us your info
[01:30:57.640 --> 01:31:00.920]   Info I want your info
[01:31:00.920 --> 01:31:04.840]   The same thing with adobe
[01:31:04.840 --> 01:31:10.360]   Creative suite subscription exactly the same thing
[01:31:10.360 --> 01:31:14.680]   I got so frustrated. I just canceled it. I'm gonna go with
[01:31:14.680 --> 01:31:17.480]   You know programs I can buy now
[01:31:18.120 --> 01:31:25.560]   Well, I wanted to try it for a week just so I could demonstrate it on tomorrow and iOS today and all of that
[01:31:25.560 --> 01:31:27.560]   But I guess not
[01:31:27.560 --> 01:31:33.640]   And how do you fight customers who say but wait a minute doesn't cost up against my bandwidth. Isn't that a good thing? What's wrong with that?
[01:31:33.640 --> 01:31:38.600]   You just have to explain. I mean, that's that's the thing. It's like
[01:31:38.600 --> 01:31:44.760]   It's like explaining that sugar is going to like rot your teeth. I mean, it's it's exactly it's like
[01:31:45.080 --> 01:31:50.280]   Yeah, but it's sugar, but it's sweet right. It's wonderful. You can eat that. I'll go to the dentist later
[01:31:50.280 --> 01:31:57.800]   By the way, by the way, somebody in the chatroom just got me. He said, but leo they're just optimizing for profit

[01:32:16.200 --> 01:32:18.440]   Have a feeling we're not done

[01:33:19.240 --> 01:33:20.600]   I

[01:33:35.640 --> 01:33:40.520]   Which is the one we recommend you start with 26 hours you get that for free. I listen to a lot of
[01:33:40.520 --> 01:33:44.120]   Rock music like i've got bruce springsteen's book
[01:33:44.120 --> 01:33:47.880]   On pre-order that comes out in a week or two. You could get that for free
[01:33:47.880 --> 01:33:49.720]   um
[01:33:49.720 --> 01:33:52.120]   Just there's so much great stuff on here
[01:33:52.120 --> 01:33:55.480]   mr. robot
[01:33:55.480 --> 01:33:59.000]   This is the creator mr. ror. This is actually an interesting book
[01:33:59.560 --> 01:34:04.280]   It's um, it's a tie-in for mr. robot. It's alia's journal
[01:34:04.280 --> 01:34:10.680]   And it's and it's written by sam s me all who created the show and corny loney who helps write it
[01:34:10.680 --> 01:34:15.560]   So it's kind of the story behind season two
[01:34:15.560 --> 01:34:20.120]   And what's to come? I think this is an interesting way to do a tie-in. It's not a novelization
[01:34:20.120 --> 01:34:23.960]   It's the journal. You know who else's journal is on audible

[01:34:34.280 --> 01:34:36.840]   Carrie blows the lid
[01:34:36.840 --> 01:34:39.720]   Off her relationship
[01:34:39.720 --> 01:34:46.840]   With harris and ford back when they were making the movie these are her diaries from when she was making the first star wars movie
[01:34:46.840 --> 01:34:53.000]   And of course carry fisher is in it. I love her. I've been hearing interviews with her and she's just great
[01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:54.360]   So she is phenomenal
[01:34:54.360 --> 01:35:01.640]   Here's the chance to get two books free if you go to audible.com/twit and the number two audible.com/twit and the number two
[01:35:01.640 --> 01:35:06.120]   Lots of great books on here. That's the hardest part is to pick a book
[01:35:06.120 --> 01:35:12.520]   But once you do, oh, there's a new Neil game and oh, I love Neil game and oh and he reads it. Oh boy
[01:35:12.520 --> 01:35:16.520]   Actually, it's not new it came out in may the view from the cheap seats
[01:35:16.520 --> 01:35:19.560]   Oh, that's what that says. Yeah, it's nonfiction
[01:35:19.560 --> 01:35:22.600]   But he listened to his voice one
[01:35:23.080 --> 01:35:25.080]   Some things I believe
[01:35:25.080 --> 01:35:32.040]   I believe that in the battle between guns and ideas ideas will eventually win
[01:35:32.040 --> 01:35:38.600]   He is the best narrator for an author i've ever heard he's he's just he's it's a great performance
[01:35:38.600 --> 01:35:42.920]   In fact listen to his other books like he narrates never where which is it's just so beautiful
[01:35:42.920 --> 01:35:49.000]   Such an old john quincey annums. There's a new biography. I listened to a lot of biographies too. Anyway pick two books
[01:35:49.880 --> 01:35:53.080]   Uh and enjoy do travel writers go to hell?
[01:35:53.080 --> 01:35:55.480]   maybe
[01:35:55.480 --> 01:36:02.760]   Maybe this is the one i've got on my wishlist millennium from religion to revolution as civilization has changed over a thousand
[01:36:02.760 --> 01:36:05.800]   Years, Ian mortimer is a is a great
[01:36:05.800 --> 01:36:10.600]   Historian and popularizer of history and i'm very excited about this
[01:36:10.600 --> 01:36:15.640]   This is in my wish list for next when i next get credits, but you could get it right now
[01:36:15.640 --> 01:36:19.320]   Nice thing about audible is you download it and it's it's yours immediately
[01:36:20.120 --> 01:36:25.320]   You can even stream it on a chrome book they have apps for the uh, iphone for android for windows phone for windows
[01:36:25.320 --> 01:36:28.200]   Just fabulous audible.com/twit to
[01:36:28.200 --> 01:36:34.760]   We thank them for their support and by the way atnt if you want to advertise on twit i'll be much nicer to you
[01:36:34.760 --> 01:36:38.680]   No, no, I might not no I won't
[01:36:38.680 --> 01:36:41.800]   No
[01:36:41.800 --> 01:36:45.560]   I'm home the truth is we wouldn't accept the advertising what this happens a lot by the way
[01:36:45.560 --> 01:36:48.360]   uh people come and say we want to buy ads and and
[01:36:49.240 --> 01:36:53.160]   We'll say well did you hear what leo said about you three shows ago
[01:36:53.160 --> 01:36:57.080]   And then we never hear from that again
[01:36:57.080 --> 01:36:59.880]   Uh, let's see google google ai
[01:36:59.880 --> 01:37:04.040]   reads retinas to prevent blindness and diabetics
[01:37:04.040 --> 01:37:11.640]   I think google's starting to leak out on a like almost a weekly basis new information from its artificial intelligence research
[01:37:11.640 --> 01:37:14.520]   I just to kind of say see what we can do now
[01:37:14.520 --> 01:37:17.800]   so the latest is
[01:37:17.960 --> 01:37:19.960]   uh, an ai that can
[01:37:19.960 --> 01:37:24.920]   Detect and identify and diagnose diabetic retinopathy retinopathy
[01:37:24.920 --> 01:37:29.960]   Which is a big cause of blindness among adults using deep learning?
[01:37:29.960 --> 01:37:37.320]   So it looks at retinal photos normal and abnormal and learns what abnormal looks like and now can classify it
[01:37:37.320 --> 01:37:43.800]   Pretty cool
[01:37:43.800 --> 01:37:47.320]   We're gonna see a lot more of that. It's just the beginning I think isn't it?
[01:37:47.880 --> 01:37:51.720]   I mean you can there's the parkinson's test for how your voice sounds
[01:37:51.720 --> 01:37:57.880]   There's this there's I feel like there's one for macular degeneration or maybe it's cataracts cataracts for sure. Yeah
[01:37:57.880 --> 01:38:00.840]   Yeah, so I I love it. I I think
[01:38:00.840 --> 01:38:07.640]   It does bring up some interesting like how soon would you tell someone if you see that they're in this group
[01:38:07.640 --> 01:38:15.000]   It's kind of like the the b.r. The I don't know how to brc a testing. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah the breast cancer gene
[01:38:16.280 --> 01:38:23.880]   So like we're not we're not there yet, but it brings up all these interesting like if the test is accurate or even
[01:38:23.880 --> 01:38:27.080]   90 accurate
[01:38:27.080 --> 01:38:29.000]   I think you have a respect you have to tell them
[01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:35.880]   So what if it's 90 accurate you tell them but like now this person has to go find a doctor
[01:38:35.880 --> 01:38:41.160]   They have like that if they want a double mastectomy because they're at high risk for breast cancer
[01:38:41.160 --> 01:38:44.600]   Oh, we're talking about breast cancer. Is that what is that the burka what is the burka gene?
[01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:48.120]   It is it is sorry. I thought I was thinking about something like uh
[01:38:48.120 --> 01:38:50.680]   retinal that I can
[01:38:50.680 --> 01:38:57.480]   I think like take a step back and just say what is how are we going to train people to think about?
[01:38:57.480 --> 01:39:01.320]   Uh medicine, which has been so far
[01:39:01.320 --> 01:39:08.920]   Prescriptive not preventative rights. I think that's the bigger challenge we have right from a social standpoint
[01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:14.200]   Like how do we make people health care system and all these other issues
[01:39:14.200 --> 01:39:18.760]   Including you know how we pay for medicine and medical care
[01:39:18.760 --> 01:39:24.440]   to come to terms with the predictive nature of the of our
[01:39:24.440 --> 01:39:31.320]   Of our you know technologies as they go forward and I think that is again part of my whole
[01:39:31.320 --> 01:39:33.960]   conversation about
[01:39:34.200 --> 01:39:41.960]   Technologies having empathy is understanding that aspect of it. Yeah, right like I mean it might be good for people
[01:39:41.960 --> 01:39:46.280]   Who can afford to go and get that you know treatment?
[01:39:46.280 --> 01:39:49.000]   And what if you don't have?
[01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:53.080]   Any uh any ability to you know pay for treatment?
[01:39:53.080 --> 01:39:58.440]   Are you sentenced to death in that sense and how do you live with something like that?
[01:39:58.440 --> 01:40:01.320]   And I think the ethics around these issues are pretty
[01:40:02.120 --> 01:40:08.680]   You know important to discuss and talk about and I I think most technology companies need to start doing that
[01:40:08.680 --> 01:40:14.200]   Especially the google you know in my opinion. They need to take some time along these issues
[01:40:14.200 --> 01:40:18.920]   Yes, even if it's not a death sentence per se
[01:40:18.920 --> 01:40:25.720]   If your phone says hey, you might have Parkinson's and you don't have insurance or you can't afford a doctor's appointment
[01:40:25.720 --> 01:40:27.080]   just
[01:40:27.080 --> 01:40:29.080]   even getting a sense like
[01:40:29.800 --> 01:40:31.800]   You know even getting an okay there
[01:40:31.800 --> 01:40:36.600]   Becomes like to see if you're okay is expensive and prohibitive or
[01:40:36.600 --> 01:40:39.560]   It usually take I mean I know to go into my doctor
[01:40:39.560 --> 01:40:44.040]   It takes me sometimes like my neurologist has like a six-week waiting list, right?
[01:40:44.040 --> 01:40:46.360]   and so
[01:40:46.360 --> 01:40:52.040]   Thinking about living with your phone saying you might have something wrong with you for a long period of time
[01:40:52.040 --> 01:40:56.120]   I mean even a doctor doesn't call you on the phone and tell you negative test results
[01:40:56.120 --> 01:41:01.000]   Usually they make you come in and they give you a lot of information. I don't know it just
[01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:07.080]   I can see this going very bad very poorly
[01:41:07.080 --> 01:41:11.080]   Leo, what do you think?
[01:41:11.080 --> 01:41:13.800]   Well, I think there's two different issues. There's the infra infra
[01:41:13.800 --> 01:41:17.960]   I love what you said, which is it is completely rethinking how we think about medicine
[01:41:17.960 --> 01:41:20.600]   Although there's always been preventative medicine
[01:41:20.600 --> 01:41:23.240]   um and the and the best
[01:41:23.240 --> 01:41:26.040]   medical
[01:41:26.280 --> 01:41:32.520]   Treatment is is kind of holistic and proactive as a as opposed to treating an illness, right?
[01:41:32.520 --> 01:41:38.360]   And I think many uh, you know even even some enlightened health insurers
[01:41:38.360 --> 01:41:41.960]   Particularly hmo's are starting to think that way
[01:41:41.960 --> 01:41:47.480]   Although the economics of health insurance it turns out discourage that
[01:41:47.480 --> 01:41:52.120]   uh paul crugman in his book the conscience of a liberal talks about
[01:41:52.680 --> 01:41:58.200]   the fact that uh health insurers don't think long-term because people move around a lot
[01:41:58.200 --> 01:42:00.840]   so they don't like to ensure
[01:42:00.840 --> 01:42:03.640]   proactive diagnostics
[01:42:03.640 --> 01:42:10.280]   Because you're going to find a problem that they're not going to have to pay for in many cases. So why pay for the
[01:42:10.280 --> 01:42:12.840]   proactive treatment
[01:42:12.840 --> 01:42:18.360]   If they're not going to have to pay for the reactive treatment when you get the heart attack
[01:42:19.720 --> 01:42:24.520]   Uh, and uh, so that's why modern health insurance isn't doing a very good job in terms of that
[01:42:24.520 --> 01:42:29.480]   But I think medicine in general and doctors understand the real value of kind of
[01:42:29.480 --> 01:42:32.440]   finding problems before they occur and
[01:42:32.440 --> 01:42:35.160]   And uh and treating for them
[01:42:35.160 --> 01:42:38.280]   That's not a there's no that's nothing new is it?
[01:42:38.280 --> 01:42:46.280]   Uh, on the other hand we do have and this is a boy. That's a really good example of we were talking about incoming inequality
[01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:51.560]   You could talk about that in many ways besides just money and that's a very good example of
[01:42:51.560 --> 01:42:56.200]   An inequality is created by information and then the ability to do something about it
[01:42:56.200 --> 01:43:00.280]   I think the information is a law like now the
[01:43:00.280 --> 01:43:02.120]   Inequality
[01:43:02.120 --> 01:43:05.480]   Is based on data and information and some some people
[01:43:05.480 --> 01:43:09.240]   Will have more information if you can afford it, right?
[01:43:09.240 --> 01:43:12.680]   You just like me. I'm asking you how to secure my
[01:43:12.680 --> 01:43:15.560]   My computer systems and my phones
[01:43:16.040 --> 01:43:19.320]   When there are poor poor people whose phones are being hijacked
[01:43:19.320 --> 01:43:22.520]   By malware. So I think the disparity
[01:43:22.520 --> 01:43:29.160]   In the society is also starting to reflect in our technology production that way as well
[01:43:29.160 --> 01:43:38.200]   Well, I do hope that we you know we get better at um, you know, I'm all for genetic testing and uh, uh, yeah
[01:43:38.200 --> 01:43:44.280]   Things like that. I mean there's an ethical issue, but I don't you know this burqa 2 is a barka 2 is a good example where
[01:43:44.760 --> 01:43:48.440]   uh, and it's used primarily because the
[01:43:48.440 --> 01:43:52.440]   Response is so dramatic, right?
[01:43:52.440 --> 01:43:57.320]   Right and so if it were merely well, you should start taking vitamin c you would go. Yeah, well, whatever
[01:43:57.320 --> 01:44:00.520]   I'm gonna do that, but if it's a double mastectomy
[01:44:00.520 --> 01:44:07.000]   Um, that's so dramatic that then well now we got a question about whether we should diagnose that or not
[01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:10.200]   I mean these are tough issues to deal with yes
[01:44:10.840 --> 01:44:14.680]   And technology puts us in the position of having to deal with it, but only humans
[01:44:14.680 --> 01:44:18.280]   And can deal with it. I mean this is these are ethical issues
[01:44:18.280 --> 01:44:24.280]   Yeah, well in technology will help us refine things and make it better too. So
[01:44:24.280 --> 01:44:27.800]   The more data we have
[01:44:27.800 --> 01:44:29.800]   From patients
[01:44:29.800 --> 01:44:36.440]   And we have the compute capability to analyze this in a way that we've never had before and had a way to do it really cheaply and quickly
[01:44:36.920 --> 01:44:42.680]   So it's possible we'll get to a point where soon we can be like, oh you have brca
[01:44:42.680 --> 01:44:49.720]   One and you have this other crazy gene up here and in 88 percent of the cases
[01:44:49.720 --> 01:44:55.640]   We have this you know that that merits a double mastectomy. Yeah, um, so
[01:44:55.640 --> 01:45:00.920]   I want to I want us to be cautious that I want us to think about how we because we
[01:45:00.920 --> 01:45:04.200]   We don't often talk about this, but how do you deliver that data?
[01:45:04.200 --> 01:45:08.040]   What are the next steps from because that's where technology falls short
[01:45:08.040 --> 01:45:11.320]   We we don't think about anything beyond like who we can do this
[01:45:11.320 --> 01:45:15.720]   And we need to think beyond that and I
[01:45:15.720 --> 01:45:19.960]   With genetic testing it becomes really scary with health testing
[01:45:19.960 --> 01:45:27.000]   It'll it has the potential to be incredibly accurate, but also incredibly disruptive if you tell someone that you know
[01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:33.320]   And we don't have data sharing and privacy mechanisms in place really for this either. Okay, this happened
[01:45:33.320 --> 01:45:38.280]   All these technology stuff is happening so fast that it's taking a lot longer for human institutions to
[01:45:38.280 --> 01:45:41.960]   Adjust. I mean, that's just really the kind of the story
[01:45:41.960 --> 01:45:46.840]   In a nutshell of the last few years and we'll be the story of the next decade and maybe forever
[01:45:46.840 --> 01:45:52.200]   Technology moves faster than our human institutions can adjust to it and there's well
[01:45:52.200 --> 01:45:57.000]   There's lots of disruption as a result of it and we are in a we're in easily the most disruptive
[01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.560]   Era of in humanity right now
[01:46:00.200 --> 01:46:04.040]   I feel like we have a less sympathetic and a less reflective culture too right now
[01:46:04.040 --> 01:46:09.720]   Um as we have a very consumeristic culture. There's a lot of people who don't think about
[01:46:09.720 --> 01:46:12.600]   To circle back to own
[01:46:12.600 --> 01:46:18.840]   You know, they're not thinking about the repercussions of what they do and I don't know what I would argue the opposite
[01:46:18.840 --> 01:46:23.160]   Uh, I I think human history if you if you look at it is pretty bleak
[01:46:23.160 --> 01:46:29.240]   And pretty grim. I just finished a book 300 years of roman off zars
[01:46:29.960 --> 01:46:31.960]   Those people were nasty
[01:46:31.960 --> 01:46:34.520]   And they really subjugated
[01:46:34.520 --> 01:46:38.920]   Millions of russian people in the most horrible way possible
[01:46:38.920 --> 01:46:45.960]   Uh, and I think we are the the fact that we even have these discussions is a massive improvement
[01:46:45.960 --> 01:46:48.360]   Over years gone by
[01:46:48.360 --> 01:46:53.000]   I admit we're not perfect. We got a long way to go, but I think that we're maybe more
[01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:56.120]   Perfect than we've ever been
[01:46:57.480 --> 01:47:00.760]   I know I mean look I'm the one who's always saying uh the ceasies
[01:47:00.760 --> 01:47:04.680]   Liss lazy side of the internet and dystopian all that stuff, but really
[01:47:04.680 --> 01:47:09.000]   From a historical perspective, don't you think we're in better off than we've ever been before?
[01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:15.800]   I think we take for granted because we're not physically beating people or taking them out like stalling did and shooting them
[01:47:15.800 --> 01:47:19.240]   That we're in a better place. Well, I think that's a step forward
[01:47:19.240 --> 01:47:23.400]   That is that is true. I'm not I'm not going to argue that that but I think the
[01:47:23.960 --> 01:47:27.240]   understanding of what people can do with your data and how you can
[01:47:27.240 --> 01:47:32.280]   subjugate people through pricing through access to
[01:47:32.280 --> 01:47:35.000]   information through
[01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:38.760]   All of it's so much more subtle, but it's still
[01:47:38.760 --> 01:47:46.600]   It's still a problem. It's still a problem. Oh, I agree, but I mean look at uh, for instance, uh, women's rights
[01:47:46.600 --> 01:47:49.320]   It's far from perfect
[01:47:49.320 --> 01:47:52.920]   You know, uh women still are mistreated
[01:47:53.800 --> 01:47:58.280]   In some parts of the globe horribly, but I think you mean not america
[01:47:58.280 --> 01:48:05.560]   Yeah in north america, but but I think there's progress has been made even you could even say globally admittedly
[01:48:05.560 --> 01:48:10.840]   There are some places where it's not very good, but at all but globally there has been progress
[01:48:10.840 --> 01:48:16.600]   Uh, I think it's which is not to say a we shouldn't work on being better. We got a long way to go
[01:48:16.600 --> 01:48:19.080]   And but it's also to say
[01:48:19.080 --> 01:48:22.040]   We shouldn't say be well. It's so terrible
[01:48:22.920 --> 01:48:27.240]   I mean we are making pro we have to acknowledge we're making pro. I think we're generally maybe i'm wrong
[01:48:27.240 --> 01:48:32.200]   Are we not generally making progress in the world? It's not evenly distributed. I understand
[01:48:32.200 --> 01:48:38.280]   I would say that we are acknowledging things that happen better, but like that's a step
[01:48:38.280 --> 01:48:43.000]   Oh, but we have so far to I mean like we're not you want to talk
[01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.720]   I'm like
[01:48:45.720 --> 01:48:49.480]   Yes, we get a long way to go. I admit that we get a long way to go
[01:48:50.600 --> 01:48:54.440]   Uh, but we're uh, you know in race relations. We get a long way to go
[01:48:54.440 --> 01:48:57.880]   We're not we don't have slaves anymore at least in the us
[01:48:57.880 --> 01:49:05.800]   Uh, but we have we have more than a long way to go. No actually no. I'm sorry. It's better than it was though, right?
[01:49:05.800 --> 01:49:07.800]   It is not um, okay
[01:49:07.800 --> 01:49:12.920]   I'm gonna see you're all about one out of one out of every four women are sexually assaulted. I know
[01:49:12.920 --> 01:49:16.280]   And you know it's terrible. That's not acceptable
[01:49:16.280 --> 01:49:19.480]   and there's still
[01:49:19.720 --> 01:49:21.720]   We still have to deal. I mean
[01:49:21.720 --> 01:49:25.320]   We are not property anymore. We have the right to vote some of us
[01:49:25.320 --> 01:49:29.560]   Um, but no, and I'm I'm not going to accept that
[01:49:29.560 --> 01:49:34.680]   I can accept that there's progress, but I can't accept that we should stop
[01:49:34.680 --> 01:49:40.680]   And it feels like you're argument. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, we got a long way to go
[01:49:40.680 --> 01:49:41.880]   We shouldn't stop
[01:49:41.880 --> 01:49:44.760]   And I'm just I'm just talking. I mean not just women but
[01:49:45.560 --> 01:49:52.040]   Technology and looking at and asking these questions because I feel like we really aren't asking these questions and
[01:49:52.040 --> 01:49:56.520]   We have to because otherwise
[01:49:56.520 --> 01:50:03.880]   What are we gonna we're gonna live in like Margaret atwood's oryx and crayc world or god help us something even worse, right?
[01:50:03.880 --> 01:50:08.200]   All right, I won't I will stand corrected

[01:53:26.920 --> 01:53:31.880]   Previously on twit and then down low for art so sort of like all business
[01:53:32.040 --> 01:53:37.880]   A moment of personal computers. Yeah, business on the top and party on the back
[01:53:37.880 --> 01:53:45.640]   Android app arena in case you haven't heard by now virtual reality is apparently the next big thing or at least
[01:53:45.640 --> 01:53:50.760]   That's what a lot of people in the tech industry think personally. I'm pretty hyped about VR
[01:53:50.760 --> 01:53:56.040]   So then let's dive into a few great VR puzzle games for daydream and this week's roundup
[01:53:56.040 --> 01:54:00.120]   Windows weekly and you probably noticed that I have something rather
[01:54:00.680 --> 01:54:02.120]   Massive
[01:54:02.120 --> 01:54:08.360]   Sitting in front of me. You know I pad pro. It you know, it's so funny. This is the surface studios came on monday
[01:54:08.360 --> 01:54:10.920]   It's hard not to love this
[01:54:10.920 --> 01:54:15.080]   Security now you hacked all data encrypted
[01:54:15.080 --> 01:54:17.400]   So that was the message on
[01:54:17.400 --> 01:54:22.760]   The san francisco muni as a consequence of this hack gave
[01:54:22.760 --> 01:54:29.800]   Which actually was apparently a crypto wear attack gave passengers free rides all day saturday
[01:54:30.360 --> 01:54:36.760]   Because the entire fair processing system was down to it
[01:54:36.760 --> 01:54:41.320]   Broadcasting from the capital of the free world petaluma california

[01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:23.160]   That's the time that anyone all over the world can use the hour of code tutorials

[01:56:15.640 --> 01:56:18.360]   Today that's going to be a lot of fun
[01:56:18.520 --> 01:56:26.120]   We're talking tech stacy's here stacy hagan botham from twig she's on this week in google every wednesday the iot podcast with kevin doffle
[01:56:26.120 --> 01:56:29.880]   She's at gigastacy on twitter omalik is here the legend
[01:56:29.880 --> 01:56:32.520]   the legend
[01:56:32.520 --> 01:56:34.520]   at um.co and p.co
[01:56:34.520 --> 01:56:38.200]   Or should i say pie dot go
[01:56:38.200 --> 01:56:43.640]   pie dot go yeah, thank you p.i.c. So pebble p.m. P.co is not as a different say
[01:56:44.120 --> 01:56:50.040]   That's a sad thing to see pebble which was the most successful kickstarter of its time
[01:56:50.040 --> 01:56:57.480]   They raised $10 million in 2012 for the pebble watch they were asking for $100,000
[01:56:57.480 --> 01:57:03.400]   Then they came back to the well they asked for 500,000 for the pebble time snak $20 million
[01:57:03.400 --> 01:57:07.240]   it's an amazing success story and
[01:57:07.240 --> 01:57:11.240]   At one point they were offered what was it?
[01:57:11.880 --> 01:57:13.880]   $40 million
[01:57:13.880 --> 01:57:17.160]   Yeah, I think it was 750 and they turned it down
[01:57:17.160 --> 01:57:20.520]   And then a little later on
[01:57:20.520 --> 01:57:23.240]   Somebody came along and offered them, you know
[01:57:23.240 --> 01:57:26.200]   70 million they turned it down
[01:57:26.200 --> 01:57:33.400]   Now fitbit is apparently acquiring pebble but and it's thought to be for somewhere around $40 million a lot less
[01:57:33.400 --> 01:57:38.760]   Uh in fact one of the reasons is so less is pebble has a huge amount of
[01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:42.440]   debt
[01:57:42.440 --> 01:57:46.840]   The pebble this is from of course jessica lesson and read albargotti at the information
[01:57:46.840 --> 01:57:53.160]   The pebble brand will be phased out after the deal fitbit gets pebbles intellectual property its operating system
[01:57:53.160 --> 01:57:56.040]   And it's kind of a sad
[01:57:56.040 --> 01:57:59.800]   End to a real high flyer. What happened?
[01:57:59.800 --> 01:58:05.480]   Oh, you want to opine
[01:58:05.480 --> 01:58:10.680]   because we are investors in fedbit. I will politely
[01:58:11.320 --> 01:58:13.320]   accuse myself
[01:58:13.320 --> 01:58:15.240]   Well, that was very polite
[01:58:15.240 --> 01:58:19.960]   That that was lovely. How about you stacy? Are you an investor in fitbit? I am not an investor
[01:58:19.960 --> 01:58:23.560]   I did you know what I did order a pebble off of a kickstarter
[01:58:23.560 --> 01:58:26.360]   I ordered the first one and the second one I did both of them
[01:58:26.360 --> 01:58:31.720]   I had the first one and I did the pebble core which still hasn't shipped so i'm like, oh
[01:58:31.720 --> 01:58:34.120]   But it's not supposed to ship till january. I don't think you're getting it
[01:58:34.120 --> 01:58:36.200]   Shh
[01:58:36.200 --> 01:58:38.520]   Hush your mouth hush your mouth. I don't think you're getting it
[01:58:39.240 --> 01:58:41.240]   I gave my pebble time away. It was nice
[01:58:41.240 --> 01:58:45.560]   You know the problem is the category is I think smart watches are not
[01:58:45.560 --> 01:58:52.040]   At the same time as that happened motorola said yeah, we're not going to make another moto 360 the android wear watch
[01:58:52.040 --> 01:58:55.080]   I like that one that was the round one i'm wearing one right now
[01:58:55.080 --> 01:58:56.680]   uh
[01:58:56.680 --> 01:59:03.000]   It's ironic because I often say well apple watch is kind of a flop too, but apple watch
[01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:06.280]   sells pretty well in fact
[01:59:07.160 --> 01:59:10.040]   Renee richy said, you know you're a hypocrite
[01:59:10.040 --> 01:59:16.760]   No, he didn't say that but he pointed out that apple watch is outsold the amazon echo by 300
[01:59:16.760 --> 01:59:21.320]   And we all say the echo is the next big thing and the apple watch is a flop
[01:59:21.320 --> 01:59:25.640]   Um, I have never said that apple watch is a flop. I said
[01:59:25.640 --> 01:59:30.120]   Uh, I was going to say that it feels like
[01:59:30.120 --> 01:59:32.840]   It would be terrible to be a startup
[01:59:32.840 --> 01:59:37.800]   It would be terrible to be a CEO of a startup in silicon valley because you know
[01:59:37.800 --> 01:59:45.640]   This idea that you can change the world with hardware is right now just so hot and it feels like
[01:59:45.640 --> 01:59:52.760]   Just dumb. I mean even fit bit, you know when they went public everyone's like and look at go pro with
[01:59:52.760 --> 01:59:55.320]   You've got this product
[01:59:55.320 --> 01:59:58.600]   People don't replace it all the time. It's not high
[01:59:58.600 --> 02:00:00.680]   There's another example. Yeah, they had a terrible quarter
[02:00:01.400 --> 02:00:04.760]   Well, they laid off what 200 people 15 percent
[02:00:04.760 --> 02:00:11.160]   They lost millions of dollars and frankly is that because of competition is it because the we don't need a go pro because I got a
[02:00:11.160 --> 02:00:15.640]   Smart phone. No, it's because you can buy a go pro and it lasts for a long time and you don't need
[02:00:15.640 --> 02:00:20.200]   I mean, it's a good product. Yeah, poor thing, you know and
[02:00:20.200 --> 02:00:23.720]   Somebody said go pro is a media company
[02:00:23.720 --> 02:00:27.400]   That really their success was the go pro youtube channel
[02:00:27.960 --> 02:00:33.640]   And the go pro extreme videos and they really should have saw themselves as a media company not as a hardware company
[02:00:33.640 --> 02:00:36.680]   That sounds like something old would say did you say that?
[02:00:36.680 --> 02:00:42.120]   He's looking really nice now with a dark background and the lighting
[02:00:42.120 --> 02:00:47.800]   I like as the sun has gone down in san francisco. You're looking better and better. Mm-hmm. Love that
[02:00:47.800 --> 02:00:50.600]   You look so good in the dark home
[02:00:51.480 --> 02:00:59.720]   K a story show your face kc nice stat who created a very successful youtube channel 5.8 million subscribers and
[02:00:59.720 --> 02:01:03.080]   a an app that was a high flyer at first
[02:01:03.080 --> 02:01:06.600]   A million downloads, but then really didn't go anywhere called beam
[02:01:06.600 --> 02:01:09.320]   Has been acquired by cnn
[02:01:09.320 --> 02:01:13.880]   Actually, I mean you can't acquire a person these days
[02:01:13.880 --> 02:01:17.560]   So they acquired beam, but he came along with it. I guess
[02:01:17.560 --> 02:01:20.520]   Aqua hire
[02:01:21.480 --> 02:01:28.440]   I really think he's a talented guy and it's interesting cnn showing that this is that they need to somehow figure out a strategy in the
[02:01:28.440 --> 02:01:35.960]   In the new world. So you think buying this company or getting him is going to be their strategy historically. That's never worked
[02:01:35.960 --> 02:01:42.200]   That's not a great strategy, but okay. It's better than nothing. What else are you going to do if you're cnn? What do you do?
[02:01:42.200 --> 02:01:45.880]   I report
[02:01:45.880 --> 02:01:49.320]   Yeah, that's what that's the other thing they did snapchat channels
[02:01:49.960 --> 02:01:52.760]   Anybody gonna run out and buy some snapchat spectacles?
[02:01:52.760 --> 02:01:57.400]   You know if if the if the vending machine lands in Austin, I would buy them. I would get in line
[02:01:57.400 --> 02:02:00.520]   Christine
[02:02:00.520 --> 02:02:05.800]   In New York, you did it nearly it was just so long. I said, you know what? I don't need it that badly
[02:02:05.800 --> 02:02:11.160]   Christina Warren wrote a very funny piece about how dirty she felt
[02:02:11.160 --> 02:02:17.400]   Waiting in line for five hours for the snapchat spectacles probably the same line you did. I don't know
[02:02:18.120 --> 02:02:23.480]   Probably yeah, I didn't see her the hellscape of waiting five hours in line
[02:02:23.480 --> 02:02:24.760]   for
[02:02:24.760 --> 02:02:28.120]   Spectacles and she starts it with the best lead ever
[02:02:28.120 --> 02:02:32.760]   Which I can't read out loud because it's profane. I am such an a-hole
[02:02:32.760 --> 02:02:38.760]   This is the only conclusion I could come to after waiting five hours in line for two pairs of snap inks new
[02:02:38.760 --> 02:02:41.720]   Spectacles sunglasses with a camera attached
[02:02:41.720 --> 02:02:45.720]   In New York City on Thursday. Did you wait on Thursday? Was it this recently?
[02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:51.080]   Yeah last week that's it. So maybe you saw Christine in line there
[02:02:51.080 --> 02:02:56.200]   Because that was the worst idea ever for me. It was a pop up store on Fifth Saturday
[02:02:56.200 --> 02:03:02.120]   It was right down the you're getting tired. We're gonna go to bed soon. Don't worry. Oh, wait. It's on Fifth Avenue
[02:03:02.120 --> 02:03:04.120]   It's just down the street from Trump Tower
[02:03:04.120 --> 02:03:09.800]   That wasn't political at all
[02:03:09.800 --> 02:03:16.120]   No, I'm just thinking like gosh you got to contend with like tech nerds and hipsters and
[02:03:16.360 --> 02:03:20.440]   Secret service and oh because Tina writes a lot of tech reporters braved the line last week
[02:03:20.440 --> 02:03:25.640]   But honestly, I couldn't be bothered quote. There's no way I'm gonna wait in line for some hours in line for some stupid glasses
[02:03:25.640 --> 02:03:33.080]   Is something I may have actually said out loud, but I am a liar and an a-hole in spite of my own thoughts about the spectacle of spectacles
[02:03:33.080 --> 02:03:37.880]   When I found myself near the pop up on Thursday, I couldn't help but try my luck
[02:03:37.880 --> 02:03:45.480]   Now I went the week before and it was a massive line and yeah, I couldn't I couldn't do it
[02:03:46.360 --> 02:03:50.600]   I can't I'm you know what I have to read the whole damn article to find out if she ever got any
[02:03:50.600 --> 02:03:53.640]   I guess she did
[02:03:53.640 --> 02:04:00.840]   Finally at 952 I was next the minion-like vending machine itself is actually pretty cool
[02:04:00.840 --> 02:04:06.040]   As you can preview what the glasses will look like on your face and select your color swipe your credit card
[02:04:06.040 --> 02:04:10.840]   Grab your stuff and go at 955. I finally emerged from the store
[02:04:12.120 --> 02:04:17.960]   With two pairs of spectacles. Oh my god. Would you wear those in public?
[02:04:17.960 --> 02:04:21.880]   No, I think it's good that they're like utterly ridiculous. Although
[02:04:21.880 --> 02:04:27.880]   I'm sure people will wear them in public and take pictures and they're better than google glass. So
[02:04:27.880 --> 02:04:30.680]   It's the IKEA effect right didn't
[02:04:30.680 --> 02:04:37.320]   Hasn't somebody observed that because you assembled and with great pain your own furniture you love it more
[02:04:37.320 --> 02:04:40.760]   If you wait five hours in line for spectacles, you gotta love them
[02:04:41.800 --> 02:04:46.520]   Oh, that's like paying $200 for the airport router. Yeah, you're gonna justify the hell out of it
[02:04:46.520 --> 02:04:50.200]   Stern says wearing a camera is cool and creepy
[02:04:50.200 --> 02:04:54.200]   she did a great article actually talking about the rules of
[02:04:54.200 --> 02:04:59.000]   Are the social contract that we should have around these things? Yeah
[02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:00.760]   so
[02:05:00.760 --> 02:05:07.000]   I like those a friend of mine got those and I I thought they were pretty fun. Can you only uh, you
[02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:11.640]   Send two snapchat stories. Yeah, you're the one account. That's it
[02:05:12.120 --> 02:05:18.040]   I think that's good and you can't save the video. Oh, you must be able to because I've seen people. Yeah, you can save your snapchat
[02:05:18.040 --> 02:05:20.520]   stories. Yeah
[02:05:20.520 --> 02:05:23.000]   So he says here's what the here's the rules
[02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:29.560]   Uh, the camera wears code. She's proposing we will record fun out of the box experiences
[02:05:29.560 --> 02:05:34.440]   First person video is the new selfie by the way. I saw an ad this morning on nfl football
[02:05:34.440 --> 02:05:40.280]   Encouraging you to use facebook live facebook's dying for you to use facebook live
[02:05:40.840 --> 02:05:48.600]   Paying so much money to the NFL so millions of dollars to get you to stream facebook live yet. Nobody wants to use it
[02:05:48.600 --> 02:05:53.720]   Maybe these spectacles we will record face-to-face interactions with permission
[02:05:53.720 --> 02:05:59.320]   Permission we will record interesting places without annoying our peers
[02:05:59.320 --> 02:06:03.720]   He doesn't have to be your peers. It could be your betters or your lessors
[02:06:05.640 --> 02:06:12.440]   Doesn't have to be your peers. We will not record in private areas. No sneaking into the bathroom the locker room the courthouse
[02:06:12.440 --> 02:06:17.160]   Well, airport security you have the right to record airport security. I think you should
[02:06:17.160 --> 02:06:23.880]   I am definitely pretty sure all those things she's talking about are going to happen pretty sure they are
[02:06:23.880 --> 02:06:25.800]   pretty sure
[02:06:25.800 --> 02:06:27.800]   we will I remember
[02:06:27.800 --> 02:06:32.200]   Oh, I was gonna say om has uh, remember when you had the narrative camera
[02:06:33.080 --> 02:06:36.360]   And I had that too. Yeah, I had it. You were at a restaurant
[02:06:36.360 --> 02:06:41.240]   I hated what people would walk up to you with that thing on them and I loathed it
[02:06:41.240 --> 02:06:46.680]   I hated the idea because it goes everywhere with you and it takes a picture every 30 seconds even in the gym locker room
[02:06:46.680 --> 02:06:50.680]   So I just didn't like talking to om with like the little camera
[02:06:50.680 --> 02:06:54.840]   Wait, I know you're not wearing it now. Is it because like me those pictures were terrible
[02:06:54.840 --> 02:07:01.480]   Because the company is no longer in business. Are you snareative? Yes. Yeah, I didn't know that
[02:07:01.720 --> 02:07:07.160]   They changed their name didn't they and then they went out of business. They um, there was always pictures of people's belly
[02:07:07.160 --> 02:07:09.160]   And I mean, it's like it was
[02:07:09.160 --> 02:07:16.200]   It's not a good angle. They were issues. There were issues. We fixed most of them. I was an investor in that
[02:07:16.200 --> 02:07:24.120]   Sorry, you can recuse yourself then. No, I just like you're hating on it. Please go free free free. I well, I got it. I bought it
[02:07:24.120 --> 02:07:27.480]   I was hating on it for the permissionless
[02:07:28.360 --> 02:07:33.000]   photographing of people like they're just taking it off and put it on the on the
[02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:38.760]   Stuff on the table and it would stop recording. I think
[02:07:38.760 --> 02:07:41.480]   So I didn't know they went up in November 1st
[02:07:41.480 --> 02:07:44.280]   They're going to keep running the service
[02:07:44.280 --> 02:07:46.920]   But they're transferring the operations
[02:07:46.920 --> 02:07:50.120]   To a new company. Does somebody buy them?
[02:07:50.120 --> 02:07:53.880]   Or I don't know
[02:07:54.280 --> 02:07:58.360]   We're happy and proud to make is our very first announcement that the narrative service will not shut down today
[02:07:58.360 --> 02:08:02.760]   That's not a good start
[02:08:02.760 --> 02:08:08.520]   Uh, she also says these are the final two rules. We will not share footage if people don't want it to be shared
[02:08:08.520 --> 02:08:13.240]   She says I did it. I recorded a video of my sister sleeping and drooling
[02:08:13.240 --> 02:08:17.800]   The glasses were on it was so easy to press the button. I thought it was funny
[02:08:17.800 --> 02:08:23.400]   She didn't not even with a sleep emoji and pretty filter. I added in the snapchat app
[02:08:23.880 --> 02:08:28.840]   Well, now I want up here. I want to I want to take pictures of people sleeping and drooling
[02:08:28.840 --> 02:08:31.560]   We will not record everything we do we do
[02:08:31.560 --> 02:08:35.320]   Don't record everything be selective
[02:08:35.320 --> 02:08:39.560]   Fair enough
[02:08:39.560 --> 02:08:41.720]   All right, your dog says it's time to go
[02:08:41.720 --> 02:08:45.560]   Hey, sorry before you go. What was the name of that?
[02:08:45.560 --> 02:08:48.760]   VPN service you were
[02:08:49.800 --> 02:08:55.080]   the key tiny hardware firewall calm tiny hardware
[02:08:55.080 --> 02:08:59.160]   Why are you sure these are good people
[02:08:59.160 --> 02:09:03.480]   Are they are they Russian?
[02:09:03.480 --> 02:09:07.240]   They're from washington dc. How bad could they be?
[02:09:07.240 --> 02:09:12.440]   Okay, I just
[02:09:12.440 --> 02:09:17.640]   I want to make sure I mean buy a fight concert. You know what you can make your own
[02:09:18.920 --> 02:09:23.880]   All you need is I mean, this is some Chinese company makes these and then they put software on them
[02:09:23.880 --> 02:09:29.720]   The idea here's why I like it because you can run a VPN you can run a VPN software
[02:09:29.720 --> 02:09:34.120]   You don't need to do anything particular, but I like it for two reasons one. It's automatic
[02:09:34.120 --> 02:09:38.360]   Everything you do on the internet goes through this thing, right?
[02:09:38.360 --> 02:09:42.600]   And it's a it's a impermeable barrier against the outside world to
[02:09:42.600 --> 02:09:47.400]   If you want you could not with a little thumb drive one but with this you can turn off
[02:09:48.040 --> 02:09:53.480]   Wi-Fi on your computer and that we know is a is even if you're not, you know
[02:09:53.480 --> 02:09:59.160]   Tied to an access point if you're just sitting there is a certain attack service
[02:09:59.160 --> 02:10:03.160]   So, uh, it's a good it's a good
[02:10:03.160 --> 02:10:07.720]   Rule of hygiene to not have Wi-Fi on in public
[02:10:07.720 --> 02:10:11.240]   Like if you were going to defcon the big hacker conference
[02:10:11.240 --> 02:10:17.720]   You wouldn't even bring your own phone and computer, but if you did you turn off Wi-Fi for sure and bluetooth
[02:10:18.360 --> 02:10:19.880]   So
[02:10:19.880 --> 02:10:25.240]   No, this is a this is a this this company that does these has been around forever
[02:10:25.240 --> 02:10:29.000]   Uh, I can't remember. Yeah. Oh, I love them
[02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:34.120]   And I've been using them and I trust them and they're they're washing in deep sea based company
[02:10:34.120 --> 02:10:37.480]   I wish I can remember their name that's been doing this kind of thing for a long time
[02:10:37.480 --> 02:10:44.120]   Wi-Fi consulting. That's it. Wi-Fi consulting ink. That's them. I'm on the page. I'm about to buy it
[02:10:44.120 --> 02:10:46.680]   That's all I'm yeah. I just wanted to ask you
[02:10:47.640 --> 02:10:50.200]   Uh, so the the there's if you
[02:10:50.200 --> 02:10:56.360]   I would get the one that has ethernet built in because that way you can really protect yourself
[02:10:56.360 --> 02:11:02.920]   But I have to say I always carry the little thumb drive in my briefcase in my pocket because it's it's so easy to use
[02:11:02.920 --> 02:11:07.800]   And they're not expensive and they include a they used to I think they still do yeah
[02:11:07.800 --> 02:11:12.600]   They they're 91 bucks, but you get a they include a vp a year of vpn service
[02:11:13.560 --> 02:11:19.400]   Or you can just buy the hardware if you want 30 dollars for the uh, the thumb drive the 35 dollars for the uh,
[02:11:19.400 --> 02:11:21.720]   What with ethernet ports? So they're very inexpensive
[02:11:21.720 --> 02:11:27.240]   Oh, well, they're saying it'll well it depends on your connectivity, but it says with the vpn active
[02:11:27.240 --> 02:11:32.120]   Maxes out at eight to ten megabits per second. Well, that's true of any, you know, this is always an issue
[02:11:32.120 --> 02:11:37.960]   With vpn's and tours the more stuff you put in between you and the outside world is slower. It's going to be
[02:11:37.960 --> 02:11:42.760]   But in my experience, I've used vpn's in a variety of situations. This is the least
[02:11:43.560 --> 02:11:45.720]   Slowdown i've experienced eight megabits is good
[02:11:45.720 --> 02:11:49.240]   You're not gonna stream netflix on this thing you shouldn't
[02:11:49.240 --> 02:11:53.320]   Um this
[02:11:53.320 --> 02:11:58.840]   Oh, okay, ethernet the ethernet one runs at 92 megabits per second with the vpn off
[02:11:58.840 --> 02:12:05.160]   Right. This is a it's not the device that's slowing you down. It's the virtual private network. It's going through all these servers
[02:12:05.160 --> 02:12:09.240]   You know, it's routing your traffic through servers. It slows you down
[02:12:09.240 --> 02:12:12.200]   I'm going to buy the little the new tidy in the poll
[02:12:13.160 --> 02:12:20.200]   Get the little napoleon. It's so cute. It's so cute. It's so cute. It's just like an apoleon
[02:12:20.200 --> 02:12:25.640]   All right, love you. I
[02:12:25.640 --> 02:12:32.120]   My wish you would come buy my house and just I don't know play with my router. I don't know anything just visit. Oh wow
[02:12:32.120 --> 02:12:37.320]   Is that an invitation it's an invitation come visit my hub
[02:12:38.280 --> 02:12:43.240]   Um, oh malik you can visit him ohm.co. That's his website pi.co
[02:12:43.240 --> 02:12:48.520]   Co is where he does great interviews really good stuff. I'm glad you're still doing some journalism
[02:12:48.520 --> 02:12:51.160]   and of course he's an investor and
