[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   This is Twit, this weekend tech, episode 17 for August 8, 2005.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   Ladies and gentlemen, it is another Twit episode and a jam packed
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   house tonight. Kevin Rose is in the house.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   That's right.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   With his T-shirt that says TV makes you smarter.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   Is that a jinx hackware?
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   No, no, I just found this in the mall.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   That was funny.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   He makes you smarter.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   He used to.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   He just looked at it and he laughed.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   Patrick Norton sitting right next to him.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   Hey Patrick, he's got the Madonna mic on.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   His T-shirt says, "Home Brood."
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   And he doesn't even drink anymore.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   He opened 24 hours.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   Absolutely was a skate shop on Mommy Challenge.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   Also on Skype we've got a big crowd.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   John C. Devorak who figured out what was wrong with his mic and he's too embarrassed to tell us.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   No.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   From all the way for Irvine, California, home of the big disc drive manufacturers, aren't they all down there?
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   Steve Gibson, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   And see all the router manufacturers are down here.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   Link, Sis and D-Lane.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   That's right.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   D-Lanes and Fremont.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   Oh, there's something of them down here.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   They have a little Irvine operation down there.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   Robert Herron who is of course one of the former lab rats now at PC Magazine and you're in the East Bay, yes?
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   Yes I am.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   And Roger Chang who is just.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   Oh, he's around.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   We just call him Yahweh for short.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   Hey, did you want to?
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   This is I think the largest group we've ever had, seven geeks.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   I got the story of the day.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   Biggest story of the week.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   I'm going to read it straight from the press release from the FCC dated August 5th, 2005.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   FCC eliminates mandated sharing requirements on incumbents, wire line broadband internet access services,
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   decision places, telephone and cable companies on equal footing.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   And it puts the small ISP out of business.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   Yeah, FCC today adopted policies that will bring in more and better broadband services to consumers by eliminating
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   facilities, sharing requirements on facilities based wire line broadband internet access service providers.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   Now who wants to translate that into real speak?
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   What's it mean? What's it mean Patrick?
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   Well, I mean basically it means the baby bells no longer have to allow line sharing for smaller DSL companies.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   And it puts the people like my local ISP SonicNet in deep deep trouble.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   It's actually very bad news for them.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   SonicNet for a fact, just because they don't have to doesn't mean they won't.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   Well that's the interesting question I think right there.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   You know, is whether or not large the baby bells will in fact shut off.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Well I'll tell you my experience from SonicNet which is right up here.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   We've had Dane Jasper, their CEO on the screen savers.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   He runs CISPA, he's one of the members of CISPA the California Internet Service Providers,
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   Independent Internet Service Providers Association.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   He says SBCs would try to put him out of business for years and you bet SBC O'Macamal.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Now you're sitting in here right now with a SBC provisioned line but a DSL extreme provided connection.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   Let's see how long it takes before SBCs says you've got to go with Yahoo or nothing.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   Don't you think they'll do that immediately?
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   Why did the FCC do that?
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   They've always done that with cable.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   The FCC sold out years ago, it's a pathetic organization.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   Yeah I have to say I agree with it.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   Ever since they did the whole selling off their frequencies five years ago or six years ago,
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   it seemed kind of to go downhill from there.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   What happened essentially is that DSL lines are considered an information service,
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   not a telecommunications service.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   So that's how that's the lose one.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   How does that work?
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   I get a DSL signal.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   Where's the information?
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   There's nothing on it.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   That's a good point.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   This is going to go to court.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   This is not going to last.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   This is going to get overthrown again.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   All right.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   Next topic.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   Next topic.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   Going down fast.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   TPA trusted platform.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   What is it?
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   Trusted?
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   No I can't remember.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   I know a TCPA is Trusted Computing Platform Alliance.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   Trusted platform.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   It's the chip that, well all right it's Palladium.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   Let's call it Spade a Spade.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   This is the Microsoft dark horse that they floated a while ago.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   And when everybody said whoa they said oh it's not Palladium anymore.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   It's a industry wide consortium of people who are looking to protect you from yourself.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   But the reason it surfaces once again Microsoft's kind of shut up about it.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   But all of a sudden there's rumors that Apple has put a TPM chip on the motherboard of some.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   Apparently not all but some of the developer boxes they shipped out.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   Now why is that a bad thing?
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   Well because TPM not only provides built in hardware copy protection but it also allows
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   people to do things like for instance destroy a song that you don't own by reaching in you to your computer
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   and pressing a button in effect.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   It also allows a company that makes a program say a word processor called I don't know Microsoft Word
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   to prevent anybody else from reading files created with that program.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   It is a serious I think invasion of the user's privacy.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   Any thoughts?
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   Yeah this is the as this is going nowhere.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   It's a dead end it's never going to happen.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   No I think it is and I think here's the irony I think Microsoft realized it was a bad idea and just like you backed off.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   But then Apple said well wait a minute we've got some way we've got some way figure out how to
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   protect OS 10 to keep people from installing it on Dell.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   TPM Hallelujah were saved.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   Well isn't the awesome big reason is they're looking for a more secure way if they do plan to move forward with a
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   movie version of iTunes.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   You know even the TPM people say it's not very good for copy protection.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   It actually isn't a good technology for copy protection they're better DRM systems.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   It's really designed to do things like prevent you from running applications on your system.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   That means essentially it's a dongle on the motherboard.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   Yes it's exactly what it is.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   And by putting that dongle on the motherboard Apple can ensure or at least attempt to ensure that you don't run OS 10.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   So has there been any software that's tied in with this or is this just it just appeared right now but nothing has actually been written to tie in?
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   Some say it's in the kernel.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   Oh it is.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   But this is the problem is you can't get straight answers.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   Well that's about.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   Why don't you buy this John?
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   It's because it'll get hacked out it's not going to work if they think they're going to do this just to protect OS 10 from going into the wild.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   I mean they've got to have their heads up their ass.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   There's no way that this can't be stopped.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   Well that's it but I mean they're got to try right or are they just going to say forget it we can't stop it.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   Why should they even be trying why don't they just take the maybe Steve Jobs should take a look at his bank account and compare it to Bill Gates's and say well hey maybe there's something to this idea of like selling an operating system into the wild.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   I mean we know we could probably get a hundred bucks a pop for it.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   I think there's some money to be made.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   What is the problem?
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   I don't get it.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   Well because Apple believes it's in a hardware company.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   They're the solutions company.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   That's ignorant.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   That really is.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   You know what this model is?
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   I don't know if anybody in America goes back this far but there used to be a company called North Star Computers.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   I haven't.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   I'm going to go back that far.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   North Star and North Gate.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   North Star versus CPM.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   There's a long time ago.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   They had their own OS but they didn't only sell it with some of their hardware.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   They were tied to the hardware and it was like the company's broke now.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   Does Apple want to go this way?
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   Nobody even remembers North Star.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   Nobody remembers Osborne once you get outside of a certain user group either.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   What's wrong with Apple trying to protect the operating system and tie it to their hardware?
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   I think they have to.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   I think that's BS too.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   I think this is nonsense.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   They can still sell hardware.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   People are still going to buy the Apple for this brand name and they can also sell software.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   What's wrong with having two income streams?
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   I just don't understand why they have to lock this thing down.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   If you put it out into the wild you're going to have a heck of a lot of more developers working on it.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   That's for sure.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   It's going to get critical mass.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   It's going to blow away Microsoft but they're just afraid of them.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   They're afraid of the future.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   Wouldn't that really kill their power book and their power max sales though?
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   If you can build a PC for 600 bucks and throw a 10 on it for 100 then you have a 700 on it.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   People are going to buy a cheap machine.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   They're always going to buy a cheap machine.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   They buy those power books like them because they're cool.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   I would probably buy a power book as opposed to one of these IBM's or Lenovo or whatever.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   They're going to call it.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   Apple stuff isn't that overpriced anymore.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   That's what they keep arguing.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   I agree.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   Maybe it's $100.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   What?
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   I'm looking at both Kevin and Patrick who are sitting here with their Think Pass.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   We both have Lenovo's right here.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:13.600]   Well, I think maybe because Apple got burnt on the whole kind of mat clone that Scully put
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:18.400]   forward and they were hoping to expand Mac user base but ended up eating into the existing
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:19.400]   Apple.
[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:20.400]   I like this theory though.
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:24.680]   What if maybe Steve really does say we know we're going to be a software company?
[00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:28.800]   This is the future for Apple.
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:29.880]   Then there's no TPM.
[00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:34.920]   So why do you think they're playing with TPM just as maybe it is to protect movies?
[00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:36.520]   Maybe it is to try to protect some of them.
[00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:40.520]   Maybe they're just trying to multiple solutions to see what sticks.
[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:43.160]   Maybe they're trying to piss people off and get that guy and bling bling to remove his
[00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:44.160]   Apple tattoo.
[00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:48.280]   It really does strike a secure platform for multimedia.
[00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:50.280]   That's really the primary focus of it.
[00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:55.200]   Yeah, but does anybody still believe because most of the online systems for distributing
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:10:01.120]   media now are all based on regularly changed encryption or regularly rotated encryption
[00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:04.360]   that's being done for temporary online distribution?
[00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:06.680]   Everybody agrees you've got to change encryption.
[00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:13.080]   Yeah, because Hollywood's probably learned this lesson from CSS at this point.
[00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:17.000]   It could also be that they're applying a unique identifier, a really good unique identifier
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.480]   for everyone's system then.
[00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:19.480]   That's a chip.
[00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:20.480]   You don't have to.
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:21.480]   That's in the chip.
[00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:23.440]   You don't have to at least say who grabbed it.
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:25.400]   Every Intel chip has a unique identifier.
[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:28.960]   Well, every ether that card has a unique identifier.
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:31.800]   Yeah, but you can just move a Mac address.
[00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:32.800]   You can't spoof the Intel chip.
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:35.440]   As far as I know, you can't spoof the Intel chip ID.
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:37.440]   Well, I don't see why anyone's pissed off right now.
[00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:38.960]   I mean, they're just playing around with it.
[00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:40.760]   Obviously, they haven't made any firm commitments, right?
[00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:41.960]   Yeah, I agree with that too.
[00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:44.120]   I mean, why should we jump to conclusions?
[00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:45.480]   Because that's what we're here for.
[00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:46.800]   Our job is to jump to conclusions.
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:50.720]   Did you see the great or the Fox news of tech coverage?
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:51.720]   We decide.
[00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:55.520]   We do and you end up better than any other tech journalists in podcasting.
[00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:57.920]   We decided to shut up and sit down and listen.
[00:10:57.920 --> 00:10:59.160]   And we'll tell you what's.
[00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:01.520]   Hey, did you see the new Trio 670 on gadget?
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:02.520]   Oh, I did.
[00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:03.520]   That's cool.
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:05.320]   Is that true or do you think that's a hoax?
[00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:06.320]   I hope it's true.
[00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:07.560]   I'm tired of the pommelier.
[00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:10.240]   A Trio running pocket PC.
[00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:11.240]   Wow.
[00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:14.880]   Well, did they recently just split off or someone?
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:17.680]   Well, I don't care because isn't Trio made by Palm?
[00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:20.240]   Yeah, but it didn't Palm.
[00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:26.160]   Palm, a split Palm one and Palm source into two divisions and then has recently renamed
[00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:27.160]   them.
[00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:28.160]   I don't know if they're reunited, but they're all Palm again.
[00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:30.080]   I don't think it'd be Linux based now.
[00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:31.600]   They're coming up with the new OS.
[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:32.600]   It's very confusing.
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:33.600]   But all right.
[00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:39.440]   So if you had your choice, a Trio 670 based on Palm or pocket PC, which is to choose.
[00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:42.320]   There's a pocket PC going to have a battery life.
[00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:43.960]   Yeah, let's say it has battery life.
[00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:46.960]   You know, say we can get a decent eight hours of battery life out of it.
[00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:49.320]   It's a pocket PC.
[00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:52.880]   Although, you know, Kevin, what was your reason for hating the Trio 650?
[00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:55.160]   I just personally didn't like how bulky it was.
[00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:56.160]   It was a little clunky for me.
[00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:00.560]   Now Steve Gibson is such a Palm fan that he actually has tungsten in his freezer.
[00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:02.520]   How many tons do you have in your freezer, Steve?
[00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:04.480]   I think I have about six or seven.
[00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:08.760]   You're going to have to explain to me why you've got seven tungsten in your freezer.
[00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:12.200]   You can't just leave that one laying there, Steve.
[00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:17.720]   I'm totally addicted to reading books on my little tea on my Palm tungsten.
[00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:20.760]   I think it's just a fantastic book reading platform.
[00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:22.840]   I carry it around with me all the time.
[00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:26.320]   And I didn't like what I was seeing Palm doing.
[00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:29.680]   I mean, who knows when they were going to just give up and disappear?
[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:34.440]   Just like, you know, Northgate keyboards or HP 35 calculators.
[00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:38.360]   I mean, I fall in love with these particular devices and I don't want to ever be without
[00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:39.360]   them.
[00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:42.560]   So this is just a long term inventory storage.
[00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:46.520]   By the way, he has Northgate keyboards and HP calculators in his freezer.
[00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:49.200]   I have one Northgate keyboard get that I won't even type on.
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:51.440]   I'm saving it for like the day I start my novel.
[00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:53.240]   How many do you have, Steve?
[00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:54.240]   How many questions?
[00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:55.240]   Northgate keyboards.
[00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:59.600]   The good news is I used to have 23 employees that every single one of them had a North
[00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:00.600]  gate keyboard.
[00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:04.240]   I got busy employees and I kept their keyboard.
[00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:06.240]   Here's a man of values.
[00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:08.240]   They're keyboards more than you guys.
[00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:12.240]   So I got the Northgate keyboards all over the house and my garage is full of them.
[00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:15.160]   And I mean, it's just the best keyboard ever made.
[00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:19.640]   Why don't we take the whole Twit organization here from Twit keyboards?
[00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:24.440]   So just go to one of us can go over to Taiwan and we'll do a deal and we'll make the damn
[00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:26.880]   keyboard again out with that.
[00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:27.880]   I like that.
[00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:30.200]   I think there's more profit in it.
[00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:32.760]   But now what makes a Northgate keyboard so much better?
[00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:38.600]   If the out key switch, the key switches are from a company called OUTS that was the,
[00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:40.600]   it's just the best feeling key.
[00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:45.000]   However, it's expensive because it's not one of these membrane keys that you're able
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.880]   to just spit out of the production line.
[00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:51.880]   However, there is a company producing something called the Ovant Stellar keyboard.
[00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:57.840]   If you put Ovant Stellar into Google, you'll take, take you to, it's like CVC ink or something.
[00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:03.240]   And their X Northgate key people still in Minnesota that are making these keyboards.
[00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:05.080]   Oh, Minnesota, that explains it.
[00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:07.240]   Have you seen the new OLED keyboards?
[00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:08.240]   Oh, yeah.
[00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:10.480]   The mock up of that one's pretty cool.
[00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:11.480]   Beautiful.
[00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:12.480]   It's also incredibly expensive.
[00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:13.480]   I don't care.
[00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:14.480]   I won't.
[00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:16.720]   What about the Matthias tactile pro keyboard?
[00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:18.480]   Anybody heard of that?
[00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:19.480]   No.
[00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:21.480]   Uvant Stellar or Stellar?
[00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:23.560]   It's cvtink.com.
[00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:29.280]   Charlie, Victory, Tango, Ink.com.
[00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:32.920]   Now I have to tell you, the tactile pro uses OUTS mechanicals key switches.
[00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:33.920]   That's tempting.
[00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:34.920]   That's a good start.
[00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:38.840]   It looks just like the Apple, it looks like an Apple keyboard.
[00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:42.280]   It's basically the old Apple keyboard once again.
[00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:44.920]   Because Apple's extended keyboard used the OUTS switches also.
[00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:46.680]   It's only 99 bucks, too.
[00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:48.560]   Does anyone use those ergonomic keyboards anymore?
[00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:49.560]   The split ones?
[00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:50.560]   Yeah, that was just a sad one.
[00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:51.560]   I usually want to work.
[00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:52.560]   Really?
[00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:53.560]   I hate those things.
[00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:54.560]   Actually, I know some people who...
[00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:57.000]   I actually used it so long, I'm used to it.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   It makes me nauseous.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.480]   Because I mean like this?
[00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:00.480]   Yeah, like that.
[00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:01.480]   Yeah, nauseous.
[00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:02.560]   I know a couple of people use.
[00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:05.680]   I have one guy who's hoarded a bunch of the old...
[00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:10.360]   Oh, I can't think of the name of the Lexmark split keyboard, which is the earliest keyboard
[00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:13.080]   ever made, but you can infinitely adjust the angle.
[00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:16.400]   And he says it's the only way he can keep from going back to carpal tunnel.
[00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:18.520]   This is a Microsoft natural keyboard pro.
[00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:22.520]   But unlike every other keyboard I have, it has two health warnings on the back of it.
[00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:25.520]   And a health warning on the cord.
[00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:29.520]   Like this keyboard, this healthy keyboard actually is more dangerous than the other ones
[00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:30.520]   I've got.
[00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:31.520]   I don't know.
[00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:34.520]   Or they just knew more about lawsuits at this point.
[00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:36.880]   Well, the Apple stuff doesn't have any warnings.
[00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:39.040]   I don't see keyboard warnings anymore.
[00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:43.600]   The problem I have with getting used to a whacky keyboard is you can't always find one.
[00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:47.080]   I mean if you're going to use a laptop, it's going to have a straight across keyboard.
[00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:51.200]   It seems to me it's better to get used to something that you're always going to be able
[00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:52.200]   to use universally.
[00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:55.840]   But I'll try one in your freezer.
[00:15:55.840 --> 00:16:00.320]   Does anybody ever use one of these bad recording keyboards or any of these whacky?
[00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:05.680]   Actually, I have a friend of mine who's a programmer and who basically had the choice
[00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:08.600]   between learning how to use one of those and never programming again.
[00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:10.200]   Because he had carpal tunnel.
[00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:11.200]   Bad.
[00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:14.440]   If he types for an hour on a normal keyboard, he's done for a commercial.
[00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:16.200]   But they look like giant piano keys.
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:17.200]   There's several of them.
[00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:18.200]   There's not very many.
[00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:19.200]   There's a couple of them.
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:24.000]   There's a third base keyboard, and there's also the ones where you actually sync each
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:29.440]   of your five fingertips into, and you can move them up, down, and left and right to
[00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:30.440]   tap the keyboard.
[00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:32.080]   It's just learning a new keyboard.
[00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:34.280]   Do they look like stenographers?
[00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:36.120]   Like a court stenographer's keyboard?
[00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:37.120]   Yeah.
[00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:41.680]   Because I used to have a class with a girl who was deaf, but she actually had a stenographer
[00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:45.440]   that this school sent with her.
[00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:49.040]   She would literally take notes in class and I bumped the notes off her after.
[00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:51.040]   That's a really good deal.
[00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:54.040]   So who's played with the mighty mouse?
[00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:56.280]   Here I am to save the day.
[00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:57.280]   Anyone?
[00:16:57.280 --> 00:16:58.280]   I ignored it at the Apple Store.
[00:16:58.280 --> 00:16:59.280]   I bought one.
[00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:00.280]   We're trying to find one.
[00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:01.280]   Yes.
[00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:04.200]   I was trying to play with it, but a bunch of people were hovering over it.
[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:09.640]   So Steve Jobs, the king of one button mice, finally gives in and makes what, like, a five
[00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:10.640]   button mouse?
[00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:11.640]   Thank God.
[00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:12.640]   Yes, finally.
[00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:14.640]   And it's instantly sold out everywhere.
[00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:15.640]   It is.
[00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:16.640]   You can't find them.
[00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:17.640]   Yep.
[00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:24.240]   Steve is one of those people who says, "I know better than 50 million other people."
[00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:25.800]   If it's not, you know, it's better than...
[00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:26.800]   And he does.
[00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:28.000]   Well, some of it may be.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.200]   I don't know, 50 millions, a lot of people.
[00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:34.920]   He's telling basically an entire world, "No, you want two buttons, but you're not going
[00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:35.920]   to get them."
[00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:40.280]   Finally, I wonder, I got to, I got to wonder, who is it at Apple that went to Steve with
[00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:43.160]   his design and said, "Can you imagine terror?"
[00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:45.520]   His wife, Mr. Jobs.
[00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:47.720]   I've got this mouse.
[00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:50.400]   No, no, no, it still looks like it has one button.
[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:51.400]   Yeah, it's right.
[00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:52.400]   You can't tell.
[00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:53.400]   You can't tell.
[00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:56.240]   But people want the multi button.
[00:17:56.240 --> 00:18:00.880]   Probably the only thing you had to do was to show Steve how many people were running
[00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:03.720]   Microsoft mice on Macintosh machines.
[00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:04.720]   Like me.
[00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:05.720]   Everybody.
[00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:06.720]   Exactly.
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:09.280]   And then he said, "Okay, no more of that."
[00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:12.640]   First thing I did, every time I get a Mac, is I go out and buy a three button mouse,
[00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:13.640]   you know, scroll wheel.
[00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:16.280]   So nobody's tried this so we don't know how this little little one...
[00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:17.280]   No, I play with it.
[00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:18.280]   What's my...
[00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:19.280]   I have the nipple.
[00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:20.280]   How does that work?
[00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:21.280]   It's like a little tiny track ball almost.
[00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:22.280]   Oh, look at this.
[00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:23.280]   Yeah, it actually rolls like a little track ball.
[00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:26.160]   And it lets you go left, right, up, down, and diagonal, right, for all those diagonal
[00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:28.800]   scrolling that you need to do.
[00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:29.880]   Is it a good gaming mouse?
[00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:30.880]   I don't know.
[00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:32.040]   I haven't played with it for gaming.
[00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:33.440]   It doesn't have any...
[00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:35.160]   It's still only one moving button.
[00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:36.160]   Right.
[00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:39.240]   It's really strange because you're so used when you grab an Apple mouse, you're normally,
[00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:42.200]   you know, you push down for that single big huge click.
[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:44.400]   But this you kind of have to rotate to the right a little bit.
[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:47.440]   It's weird, but I'll tell you what, after about five minutes of playing with it, I got
[00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:48.440]   used to the right click.
[00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:49.440]   But you shouldn't have to go through all that.
[00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:50.440]   60 bucks.
[00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:51.440]   It's not...
[00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:52.440]   Wireless.
[00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:53.440]   49 bucks.
[00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:54.440]   49 bucks is recorded.
[00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:55.440]   Here's something interesting though.
[00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:56.440]   It works with the windows.
[00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:57.440]   Does it?
[00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:58.440]   Yes.
[00:18:58.440 --> 00:18:59.440]   Out of the box.
[00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:00.440]   Yes.
[00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:01.440]   You have to install drivers on the Mac.
[00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:03.240]   You have to install drivers through this thing?
[00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:05.640]   Yes, not for the three button, but for the additional features.
[00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:06.800]   Yeah, it's like it's great.
[00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:07.800]   It's like click.
[00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:09.800]   Oh, single button looks multi button charm.
[00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:10.800]   Now, see the most?
[00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:11.800]   Roll or scroll.
[00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:14.000]   Now, do those love handle buttons?
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.080]   Is that just the squeeze?
[00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:17.080]   Is that just one button or is there one on the side?
[00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:19.720]   Squeeze is weird because you don't feel anything when you squeeze it.
[00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:21.200]   There's no click like feel to it.
[00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:24.440]   You just squeeze and then nothing happens on the screen and you wonder what you're doing.
[00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:28.880]   Apparently out of the box, both buttons do the same thing after re-fucking it.
[00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:30.360]   I was squeezing it.
[00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:31.360]   I was squeezing it.
[00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:32.840]   I think Aaron just hit it right there.
[00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:34.840]   This is a future collector's item.
[00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:38.360]   Nobody's gonna use that in a professional day-to-day basis.
[00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:39.360]   It's sold out.
[00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:40.360]   That's true.
[00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:42.360]   Oh, yeah, because it's new in its Apple.
[00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:43.600]   The Apple Army is amazing.
[00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:45.000]   They're like anything.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.960]   It's almost like the Twit Army.
[00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:47.960]   How do you think the...
[00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:50.160]   I just think the Twit Army is a little more selective.
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:51.160]   I would hope so.
[00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:52.160]   Click at our keyboard.
[00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:56.400]   Why are the fact that they ever sold some Newton demonstrates that?
[00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:57.400]   Yeah.
[00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:58.400]   You have.
[00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:02.760]   Although I have to say I've been bit twice because I also bought a tablet PC, which is
[00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:04.480]   essentially just a Newton.
[00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:07.560]   Why did you go and do something like that for?
[00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:10.520]   Actually, didn't you find it useful for doing the television stuff?
[00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:11.520]   Yeah, that you were gonna say it.
[00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:12.520]   Because you were like, "Finally!"
[00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:13.520]   That's why I bought it.
[00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:17.160]   I found a use for a tablet, Patrick, other than browsing the web on the toilet.
[00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:19.840]   I was like, "What's wrong with browsing the web on the toilet?"
[00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:23.600]   It's spending $1,500 to browse the web on the toilet for an hour.
[00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:27.880]   But the idea for TV was, yeah, there's no keyboard.
[00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:28.880]   You just use a pointer.
[00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:31.120]   Remember we were always trying to do tellestrators?
[00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:33.280]   The problem is, there is...
[00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:34.280]   I thought there was.
[00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:36.560]   Only in PowerPoint is their kind of "teletration" capability.
[00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:38.560]   It's not built into the operating system.
[00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:44.560]   Have you guys ever had any contact with that OQO, that little QO windows thing?
[00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:45.560]   Yeah.
[00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:47.280]   You've just nailed it right there.
[00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:48.760]   It's a very cute little windows thing.
[00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:50.160]   I can't imagine anybody buying that.
[00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:51.160]   Everybody wants one.
[00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:52.640]   Until they get it.
[00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:54.120]   I know a couple of people who have bought them.
[00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:55.120]   It's really cool.
[00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:59.000]   I'm not gonna have an entire desktop installation and they can carry it from place to place.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.240]   You look at them and you kind of say, "Well, why not a notebook?"
[00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:02.240]   And they go, "This is smaller."
[00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:03.240]   It is.
[00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:06.400]   It's about 6 inches by 5 inches.
[00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:10.000]   You can see they're ahead of the time too because eventually everyone will have something
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   you can't carry around.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   I disagree.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.600]   No, because the user interface device doesn't work.
[00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:16.280]   The keyboard has to be so sized to be usable.
[00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:20.560]   No, it seems like a USB thumb drive that contains not only all the information but your favorite
[00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:25.480]   OS and you can just plug that easily into somewhere that allows you to get your video
[00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:26.480]   and your image.
[00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:28.480]   You guys are missing the point with the OQO.
[00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:30.080]   What's the point?
[00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:32.800]   The thing is really not designed to be used as an everyday computer.
[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:34.600]   It's really more of an embedded system.
[00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:39.040]   You put it in some sort of an inside of an airplane or something and you only use the
[00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:41.680]   keyboard to reprogram something that's funny.
[00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:45.000]   Yeah, but they have embedded systems that cost a lot less.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.720]   Yeah, no, they do, but they don't have embedded systems with all this I/O and with the keyboard
[00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:50.720]   and with those playing and all that.
[00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:54.520]   But there's the whole point of it embedded system is to avoid all of the desktop stuff
[00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:55.520]   you don't use.
[00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:58.560]   So John, is anybody buying this in using it that way?
[00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:01.160]   I think NASA's got a bunch of them.
[00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:02.720]   It's a good buy NASA.
[00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:05.120]   John, did they send you one?
[00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:06.280]   No, you know what?
[00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:07.880]   Let me tell you that story.
[00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:11.040]   Not that I'm playing it.
[00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:14.600]   About four years ago I first got ahold of these guys that said, "Oh yeah, yeah, we're
[00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:15.600]   going to come out with it any minute."
[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:19.240]   And this was, I mean this thing's taken forever to get under the market by the way, after
[00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:21.600]   David Dinsell first showed me one of them.
[00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:24.240]   And a couple of years ago, by the way, I said, "Oh yeah, we're going to get you one
[00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:25.240]   as soon as it comes out.
[00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:27.120]   We're going to then, and I never got one."
[00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:30.080]   And I don't think they, you know, this is one of those things.
[00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:33.640]   I don't think they're going to stay in business that long, because we're very much both.
[00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:36.920]   And the other one is Paul Allen's got a clone of it, which is like, this is another
[00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:38.920]   brain dead idea.
[00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:41.120]   Paul Allen took on it.
[00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:43.360]   It's an name of the Paul Allen computer.
[00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:44.600]   It's a little bitty thing.
[00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:46.360]   Yeah, I remember seeing that.
[00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:51.080]   Lots of money, and then it just drops off after three years.
[00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:52.080]   It gets bored.
[00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:56.840]   A computer that gets bored and goes away, sells itself for below market value.
[00:22:56.840 --> 00:22:57.840]   That kind of a computer?
[00:22:57.840 --> 00:22:58.840]   Yeah.
[00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:04.840]   Does anybody have any burning questions, or should we go to our burning topics, or should
[00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:05.840]   we go to their...
[00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:07.840]   Well, are you okay, Patrick?
[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:09.840]   I just lost a lot.
[00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:10.840]   Okay.
[00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:13.840]   Or should we go to our questions from our Twitter...
[00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:14.840]   Oh, Twitterz.
[00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:15.840]   Twitterzims.
[00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:17.840]   I have another item here that he's addressing.
[00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:18.840]   Yes, sir.
[00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:22.840]   The effect is on my blog, if anyone wants to jump in on this.
[00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:26.480]   Apparently, there was a very obscure in the Portland Business Journal, a very obscure
[00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:28.480]   interview with Jeff Hawkins.
[00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:29.480]   Oh, yeah.
[00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:31.480]   And I have this actually on the blog now.
[00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:33.280]   I was reading that last night.
[00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:36.280]   Yeah, and Hawkins says that he's got something else up his sleeve.
[00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:41.840]   He says his first invention was the handheld PDA, then they put the phone in.
[00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:43.520]   Now there's something new.
[00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:45.280]   And I read this and read it over.
[00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:46.600]   I said, "What the heck could it?"
[00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:48.920]   I mean, there's nothing out there that there's no...
[00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:53.040]   Well, you should explain to everybody listening, John, that for those who don't know who Hawkins
[00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:58.720]   is, he essentially is the one of the big founders at Palm/Palm1/Palm, whatever it is this week.
[00:23:58.720 --> 00:23:59.720]   Oh, he and Ian at the...
[00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:00.720]   And he's now the CTO.
[00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:01.720]   And he invented graffiti.
[00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:02.720]   Yeah.
[00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:06.280]   Although then got sued, saying somebody else invented it like Xerox Park and, oh well, never
[00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:08.280]   mind, I didn't invent it after all.
[00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:09.960]   Well, that's beside the point.
[00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:12.600]   The thing is he is considered the father of the modern PDF.
[00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:13.760]   Yeah, I agree with that.
[00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:15.640]   But so he's got some new things.
[00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:18.200]   He's supposed to blend, you know, the next generation.
[00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:19.640]   And so anyway, I have an open form.
[00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:22.320]   If anybody thinks I can figure this out, I'd be interested.
[00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:28.560]   I think it's called it maybe ginger and it's going to revolutionize the way cities are built.
[00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:30.880]   It's got to be textured.
[00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:37.360]   I think he may have stumbled upon a way of doing voice recognition because he's a neuroscientist.
[00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:40.080]   That's really the big leap right now for all small devices.
[00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:44.440]   Samsung even showed off a CES, that one cell phone that incorporated a voice recognition
[00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:47.320]   system where you didn't have to do text using the keypad.
[00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:50.800]   You could actually text message other people just by speaking the words themselves.
[00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:54.960]   While you talk about making devices smaller exactly, I mean, what's the limiting factor?
[00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:55.960]   It's the keyboard.
[00:24:55.960 --> 00:25:00.520]   It's 19th century technology we still use for data input.
[00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:05.680]   But the problem with voice recognition is are we going to have a world of people walking
[00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:07.160]   around talking to their computers?
[00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:09.200]   No, we already now have that to their cell phones.
[00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:12.280]   Well, this is going to even make it worse.
[00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:13.840]   It needs to be some sort of...
[00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:16.200]   I'm sitting in here with two guys typing on their computer.
[00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:17.680]   I've got a computer front.
[00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:21.560]   If we were all talking to our computers, it would be nuts in here.
[00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:23.560]   I think any audience...
[00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:24.560]   I think any audience...
[00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:25.560]   Many airplanes...
[00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:29.320]   Somebody talking, quote unquote, themselves, when they have an earpiece and at least you
[00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:31.320]   hope they're doing that.
[00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:33.320]   Speaking of which, I can't freak it.
[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:37.160]   I think it would be cool in the office because you could come in there with a megaphone
[00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:40.560]   and then yell at the top of your lungs, "Format, privacy."
[00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:42.560]   Oh, my question.
[00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:44.360]   Where do you see that?
[00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:47.600]   The punch in a password.
[00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:48.600]   I do.
[00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:49.600]   I do on a tablet PC.
[00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:55.200]   If we're talking about sci-fi, how about a little band you wear around your neck and
[00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:56.200]   then you just sub-vocalize.
[00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:57.200]   There you go.
[00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:58.200]   Where do you want?
[00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:04.680]   Or if you just have one that has ESP and just reads your thoughts.
[00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:06.440]   Or like aircraft pilot microphone.
[00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:07.880]   I need a baby fish.
[00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:09.480]   But do the aircraft pilots talk?
[00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:11.480]   Yeah, they still have to talk.
[00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:12.480]   Yeah.
[00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:13.480]   They have to say something.
[00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:15.680]   Hello, to it.
[00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:18.480]   My name is Kati and I'm calling from Gem.
[00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:21.160]   Congratulations on winning broadcast awards.
[00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:23.200]   I'm really impressed with your program.
[00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:26.240]   You guys have a lot of fans in Germany, so keep going.
[00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:28.160]   I have two questions for you.
[00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:29.160]   Question number one.
[00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:36.160]   The Sony PlayStation 3 has announced to support both Linux and Macintosh OS X and having a
[00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:38.440]   highly advanced system configuration.
[00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:43.040]   Do you think that this is how the future of computing is going to look like?
[00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:47.320]   And question number two is how soon is Microsoft going to die?
[00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:48.320]   Thanks.
[00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:50.320]   I'd love to hear your opinions on this.
[00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:51.320]   Bye.
[00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:52.320]   Thank you, Kati.
[00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:54.240]   That's good.
[00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:56.320]   So we're just talking about that.
[00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:57.320]   That's a good point.
[00:26:57.320 --> 00:26:58.320]   OS X as well.
[00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:01.840]   But Apple will never let OS X for the ship, for the cell processor.
[00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:03.840]   But it's interesting that it runs on the cell.
[00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:04.840]   Yeah, it is interesting.
[00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:06.600]   That's what, you know, boy.
[00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:11.320]   I wonder if it runs directly or is it running through an emulation there?
[00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:13.320]   No, I think it will because it's a powerful season.
[00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:15.320]   Yeah, it's really, yeah.
[00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:18.840]   Hi, this is Michael Herr time from Las Vegas, Nevada.
[00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:20.520]   Call on for some help, you guys.
[00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:25.200]   But before I ask for help, I need to congratulate you guys for your two podcast awards the other
[00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:26.200]   day.
[00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:27.200]   Way to go, you guys.
[00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:28.760]   Anyways, my question is this.
[00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:31.240]   I downloaded Suzy 9.3 Linux.
[00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:32.240]   I'm a newbie.
[00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:36.800]   The problem is I can't play audio files or mp3 files on it.
[00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:40.800]   It doesn't recognize it or something or I'm missing some kind of plug in or download.
[00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:45.560]   The other problem is when I listen to KF-640 today, it says missing plug in, can't find
[00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:47.440]   it and I need your help.
[00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:48.440]   What do I do?
[00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:49.440]   Thanks a lot.
[00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:50.440]   Bye.
[00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:51.440]   That should work.
[00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:52.440]   I don't know why it's not working.
[00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:53.920]   He just needs the MMS player.
[00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:54.920]   Yeah.
[00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:56.440]   With Linux, that pretty much does it all.
[00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:59.640]   You may need some plug ins, but if you go to their site, they tell you all the plug ins
[00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:00.640]   that you should get.
[00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:01.640]   XMMS.
[00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:02.640]   XMMS is wonderful.
[00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:03.640]   Yeah.
[00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:04.640]   It's great.
[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:05.640]   Hey, I should mention that two people now mentioned in a row, we should probably say
[00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:10.480]   that we did win the People's Choice podcast award for the People's Choice, which I guess
[00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:14.520]   is the best podcast of the year and best technology podcast.
[00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:15.520]   Yay.
[00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:16.520]   That's awesome.
[00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:17.520]   And we only begged a little.
[00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:18.840]   And then you're going to go pick those up, right?
[00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:19.840]   There's a lot of conference.
[00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:20.840]   I hope you all will.
[00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:21.840]   Yeah, we should all be there.
[00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:23.080]   But I'd like everybody to come down.
[00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:27.840]   We'll foot your bill and November 11th in Ontario.
[00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:28.840]   November?
[00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:29.840]   November 11th.
[00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:31.640]   Ontario, California.
[00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:32.640]   Oh.
[00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:34.160]   Sorry, don't get your hopes up.
[00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:35.560]   Oh, I love that air force.
[00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:36.560]   Like a bus station.
[00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:38.040]   Winter in Winter in Canada.
[00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:39.040]   Yeah.
[00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:40.040]   No, Ontario, California.
[00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:41.040]   It's a nice expo.
[00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:42.280]   It's the first podcast trade show.
[00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:44.280]   Boy, that should be fascinating.
[00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:47.480]   Well, you know, I'm keynoting it, by the way.
[00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:52.000]   Well, my great fear is that the whole thing will be over by the time the expo happens.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.720]   And we'll be moved on to the next thing, right?
[00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:57.640]   Podcasting will be dead and it'll be just kind of pathetic.
[00:28:57.640 --> 00:29:00.200]   It'll be like current TV.
[00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:03.200]   No, TV makes you smarter, don't you know?
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:04.200]   It's current TV even.
[00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:06.200]   Hello, this is Jay from Boston.
[00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:08.960]   You know, I just have a quick command to run yahoo.com.
[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:12.200]   I think I found the MP3 player that I'm interested in.
[00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:16.160]   I don't know if anybody has any experience with this car.
[00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:20.440]   The website is, uh, POGO products.
[00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:26.200]   The player is called Radio Yaw Way LX.
[00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:27.200]   I've got one right here.
[00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:29.040]   It has a built-in AM and FM.
[00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:30.880]   Yeah, I've got one right here.
[00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:31.880]   I'm holding it up.
[00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:33.240]   It kind of looks like an iPod, right?
[00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:35.080]   Oh, it looks just like an FM radio.
[00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:36.080]   But it records.
[00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:38.080]   It's got like a little VCR capability.
[00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:44.600]   You know, I don't think it's the greatest MP3 player in the world because it's, uh, you
[00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:45.600]   know, it's SD based.
[00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:47.160]   So they have some internal memory.
[00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:49.520]   How much, how much is the biggest that you think of gigabyte?
[00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:50.760]   No, two now.
[00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:51.760]   Two?
[00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:52.760]   Really?
[00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:53.760]   Wow.
[00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:54.760]   How many can normal people afford?
[00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:57.200]   Well, even a gig, you know, that's, you know, that's, that's some music.
[00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:59.360]   It's a, think of it as a solid state player with radio.
[00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:03.560]   You're getting a bunch of flash on like a keychain now for about $150.
[00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:04.560]   Your kids.
[00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:05.560]   Wow.
[00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:06.560]   Ouch.
[00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:07.560]   $250 for this thing though with 512 megabytes of memory.
[00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:08.560]   Yeah, I think it's a little pricey.
[00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:09.560]   Huh.
[00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:10.560]   They're actually got money, huh?
[00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:12.400]   They're kind of out of touch.
[00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:13.400]   They're kind of out here.
[00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:15.560]   Yeah, John, some people buy their stuff.
[00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:16.560]   They're weird.
[00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:18.920]   They're, you know, it is strange.
[00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:20.520]   I don't understand it myself.
[00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:24.160]   Some people, just, I guess, well, the whole point of that thing would be the AM and FM
[00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:25.160]   recording.
[00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:26.160]   That's the whole point.
[00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:28.560]   And I, you might as well just buy a radio shark from Griffin technology.
[00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:32.000]   Yeah, but what if you don't have a computer like, uh, I just did a radio show and I, I
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.680]   tuned into this at the radio station and never quoted it.
[00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:36.200]   I, I got it.
[00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:38.640]   You just laid that one in the road and I got a run over it.
[00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:40.640]   But if you don't have a computer.
[00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:41.640]   Yeah.
[00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:44.440]   They're not probably listening to us and they're probably not really interested in
[00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:46.400]   moving content onto a portable beauty of player.
[00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:49.360]   But some people with, this is like a transistor radio has a speaker.
[00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:50.360]   Sure.
[00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:51.360]   Okay.
[00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:52.360]   And you had headphones and you could record and listen back.
[00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:57.160]   So for the people, for the people who want to do time shifting on a portable digital device
[00:30:57.160 --> 00:31:01.720]   that don't have a computer, this is definitely an option and you should tell them about it.
[00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:02.720]   And have 250 bucks to it.
[00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:06.480]   But recording formats does us a fourth because that was one problem I ran into at the last
[00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:11.200]   AM FM recorder I looked at was that it was using a voice recording quality.
[00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:12.200]   Yeah.
[00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:13.200]   This is MP3.
[00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:14.200]   This is MP3 recording.
[00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:16.800]   This is 120 and MP3 up to I think 120.
[00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:17.800]   I think 256.
[00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:18.800]   256.
[00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:19.800]   Yeah.
[00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:20.800]   So it's a real recorder.
[00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:23.800]   I record a radio show, AM radio shows a 64 kilobits and it sounds great.
[00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:24.800]   Hello, Leo.
[00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:28.080]   This is Brian from Hoboken, New Jersey.
[00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:32.240]   I was wondering if you and the gang could tell us a little bit about Ruby on rails.
[00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:38.680]   I hear it's the successor to PHP and the future of web development.
[00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:40.560]   But what do you guys think?
[00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:41.560]   I love this lot.
[00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:42.560]   Thanks a lot.
[00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:43.560]   And keep on tweeting.
[00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:47.520]   I love this study that just came out from a proprietary programming company that says
[00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:49.160]   PHP is dead.
[00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:50.160]   Yeah.
[00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:52.600]   Don't use PHP, it's dead.
[00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:53.600]   News are a product.
[00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:54.600]   I've used Ruby.
[00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:55.600]   Super soft.
[00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:57.240]   Ruby comes on OS 10 actually.
[00:31:57.240 --> 00:31:58.240]   Yeah.
[00:31:58.240 --> 00:31:59.240]   And Ruby's actually pretty powerful.
[00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:00.240]   I like it a lot.
[00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:01.240]   I haven't used Ruby on rails.
[00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:02.240]   Ruby's on rails podcast.
[00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:07.480]   Well, it's good if you can, the problem is they have audio quality like I should complain.
[00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:08.480]   Audio quality issues.
[00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:13.200]   So for those of us who avoid programming the web possible, what exactly is a full stack
[00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:17.400]   open source web framework for Ruby and writing world world applications with joy and less
[00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:20.720]   code than most frameworks spend doing XML sit ups?
[00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:27.920]   So a programming language like Ruby is useless without frameworks which basically give you
[00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:31.680]   high level access to things like networking.
[00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:36.120]   Ruby on rails is a set of frameworks that make it easy for you to write quick networking
[00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:37.120]   applications.
[00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:41.080]   So it's a really good way to cobble together fast applications.
[00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:44.960]   But you know, any good modern programming language is like pearls got a CPAN, PHP has
[00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:45.960]   tons of modules.
[00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:47.480]   Any of any modern language is going to have a lot of things.
[00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:48.880]   I've heard good things about Ruby on rails.
[00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:50.640]   This is done by those guys 37 signals.
[00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:52.320]   They're the same ones that do the base camp.
[00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:56.040]   If you use base camp before, it's kind of like a project management application for the
[00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:57.040]   web.
[00:32:57.040 --> 00:32:58.760]   I guess I'll make another one called backpack.
[00:32:58.760 --> 00:32:59.760]   I know that --
[00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:00.760]   >> That's great.
[00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:01.760]   I have used back.
[00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:02.760]   >> Yeah, backpack is pretty cool.
[00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:03.760]   >> Amber is a big fan.
[00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:04.760]   Amber turned me on the backpack.
[00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:05.760]   >> Yeah, yeah.
[00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:06.760]   I think she talks about it too.
[00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:09.000]   >> The audio was actually coded in Ruby on rails.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   >> There you go.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   That's a good example.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:14.440]   >> But I hear that you know that company Silver Orange, design company, they're coming
[00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:17.960]   up with a kind of like, I don't know if they're going to open source or what, but it's kind
[00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:21.440]   of a competitor to Ruby on rails but for PHP.
[00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:22.440]   >> Oh interesting.
[00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:25.160]   So a framework that works for PHP, which would be pretty interesting.
[00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:28.800]   That would be nice because people use PHP so much now for web programming.
[00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:31.080]   I don't think PHP is dead by the way.
[00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:32.080]   >> I know.
[00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:33.080]   >> Far from it.
[00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:34.080]   >> It's digging PHP?
[00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:35.080]   >> Yeah, it's all PHP in my scale.
[00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:36.080]   >> And it scales well?
[00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:37.080]   >> Yeah.
[00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:38.080]   We're having no problems right now anyway.
[00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:39.080]   >> Yeah.
[00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:40.080]   >> Well, I'm sure you get a lot of traffic.
[00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:41.080]   >> Oh yeah.
[00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:43.720]   We're on multiple machines and it's all on how you code it though.
[00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:46.000]   It only scales as well as the code are behind us.
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:47.800]   >> Smart codeer makes a big difference.
[00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:48.800]   >> That's true.
[00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:49.800]   Very true.
[00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:50.800]   >> Hello, my name is Jay Beaman.
[00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:51.800]   I'm in San Francisco.
[00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:57.880]   So Prager's borrowing using a ceiling internet from his neighbor.
[00:33:57.880 --> 00:34:04.080]   I have been doing the same for a long time and moving into a new house set up my own
[00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:08.880]   wifi network and want to leave it open for the Prager's of the world.
[00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:09.880]   >> What's the difference?
[00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:10.880]   >> What's the difference?
[00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:15.080]   >> I'm sure the issue should not buy anything online.
[00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:17.080]   I want to know.
[00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:18.080]   I want to leave it open.
[00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:19.080]   Sharing is good.
[00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:21.080]   Should I be scared?
[00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:22.080]   Thanks guys.
[00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:23.080]   I love the show.
[00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:26.360]   >> I think Steve Gibson has a good answer for him because you've been playing with Open
[00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:27.360]   WRT.
[00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:28.360]   >> Well, okay.
[00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:33.600]   He's going to have to be very careful if anyone is going to be hooked into his network
[00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:34.840]   no matter what he does.
[00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:38.880]   But he could certainly put an access point upstream of a net router.
[00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:41.280]   So have two separate devices.
[00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:46.720]   You know, whatever wireless access point he wants to use and then protect his internal
[00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:51.400]   network with a nice lock down that router and he's going to be pretty safe.
[00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:57.680]   But you know, things like email for example, where you're passwords in the clear to your
[00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:02.280]   remote SNTPM pop servers, that's still going to be a problem.
[00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:08.720]   >> I don't know anybody's ever been packaged sniff like that or just data has been monitored
[00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:11.120]   to the point where they were being attacked.
[00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:12.720]   >> You were a DEF guy.
[00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:16.360]   >> Yeah, I mean, it's kind of funny is the whole point of the wall of sheep at DEF
[00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:20.720]   kind is to point out that you are sending out your password in an open network.
[00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:24.280]   And this is a sketchy and dangerous thing to do if someone decides to.
[00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:25.680]   >> That's the question pointed out.
[00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:28.840]   >> We're shopping though with a secure browser on a secure site.
[00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:29.840]   >> Yeah.
[00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:30.840]   >> They're safe there.
[00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:32.520]   >> I think he should be more worried about.
[00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:37.200]   I mean, I think part of maybe what he's asking about is, you know, what if somebody's using
[00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:43.960]   my open, you know, WAP to download, you know, files off the MP3, I believe there's someone
[00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:51.400]   sitting in this room who was creating a four terabyte mobile peer to peer sharing system
[00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:54.640]   that he could rotate from open access point to open access point.
[00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:56.840]   >> That's just a technology demonstration, right?
[00:35:56.840 --> 00:36:00.160]   >> Yeah, but it proves the point that.
[00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:02.200]   >> The concept, if you will.
[00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:04.000]   >> White paper, well, someone white paper.
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.720]   You know, he may be less worried about, you know.
[00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:09.280]   >> Well, that's why I'm recommending this open WRT with this.
[00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:17.520]   You know, the Sveya soft firmware and open WRT allows you to create basically a, I think,
[00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:20.480]   secure access point that people can log into.
[00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:22.400]   You can validate that you don't have to have.
[00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:26.160]   >> Yeah, but you see, I don't want to be, you know, the problem is there's two other problems
[00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:27.160]   for that.
[00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:29.520]   One, you don't want to be responsible for what people download your system.
[00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:31.600]   So you're either going to be ignorant or not.
[00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:34.640]   >> Yeah, there are ISPs out there that are looking at traffic.
[00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:38.840]   And if they think you're consistently downloading too much traffic, they may say, hey, or more,
[00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:41.360]   is more than one person using your, you know.
[00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:45.400]   >> And that would be our first advice, check with your ISP, make sure it's even allowed to do this.
[00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:50.760]   >> Yeah, because, no, pretty much nobody but speak easy and some other smaller local ISPs,
[00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:52.840]   you know, are okay with you sharing it.
[00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:54.320]   Are most of them ever going to notice?
[00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:56.320]   >> There's no way for them to figure that out though.
[00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:57.960]   Not behind a Nat Router.
[00:36:57.960 --> 00:37:04.240]   Not by, I agree, not by the Nat Router, but they are looking at your traffic to see what's
[00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:05.240]   going on.
[00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:07.040]   >> Yeah, in some cases, there are many ways.
[00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:09.280]   >> But they're all advertised to be unlimited.
[00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:12.640]   >> Well, yeah, and that's where it gets really bad.
[00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:14.000]   >> I know, nobody that this is happening.
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:18.440]   And I'll be honest with you, I leave file sharing applications running 99% of the time
[00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:19.800]   with legit files.
[00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:24.320]   And I looked at my last upload status and it's approaching 500 gigs I've uploaded.
[00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:25.320]   >> Wow, you get to be careful.
[00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:27.040]   Some of them do have restrictions there, right?
[00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:28.040]   >> Absolutely, absolutely.
[00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:29.040]   >> Who cares?
[00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:32.520]   >> Well, that wasn't probably when I signed up for my cable down.
[00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:36.760]   It's like, you know what, you quote unquote guarantee this download bandwidth and this
[00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:37.760]   upload.
[00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:39.880]   >> Yeah, but you got to look at total bandwidth.
[00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:43.160]   Read your user license agreement.
[00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:47.720]   >> You may have a limitation on how much bandwidth you can, I mean, not, not.
[00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:48.720]   >> Who cares?
[00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:49.720]   >> You know what?
[00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:51.560]   >> The car was that much more.
[00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:52.560]   >> The car was that much more.
[00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:54.360]   >> The bill, the bill was going to be on the car.
[00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:55.360]   >> I'm switching providers.
[00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:58.160]   And suddenly I've got another three months and half my rate.
[00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:01.720]   So they want to keep me more than they want to hassle.
[00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:02.720]   >> Well.
[00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:03.720]   >> That's the way it's always.
[00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:07.240]   >> If you're doing 500 gigs a month in transfer and paying $19.95, something tells me that
[00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:08.240]   eventually they might not.
[00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:10.240]   >> No, no, I'm not paying $19.95.
[00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:13.160]   I'm paying closer to like 60 bucks a month cable move.
[00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:14.160]   >> Yeah.
[00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:17.280]   Well, the other interesting question is, you know, it would be really interesting to find
[00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:22.000]   out whether or not they're paying more attention to that in suburban areas or urban areas.
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   And if they even notice.
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   >> I don't know.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   >> They can't.
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:26.800]   There's just too much data.
[00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:29.800]   >> I think they're monitoring it absolutely.
[00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:31.800]   >> Oh, this is Twitter commander.
[00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:33.640]   >> Oh, you heard Twitter commander.
[00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:35.000]   >> Oh, you heard Twitter commander.
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   Let's move on.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:44.360]   >> People are taking this just a little bit too seriously.
[00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:46.920]   >> John, there's under the breath.
[00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:50.800]   >> Hey, Twitter, this is Brian in Pittsburgh.
[00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:56.160]   >> I hear a lot of things about the Mac Intel switch, but nobody's really mentioning the
[00:38:56.160 --> 00:39:01.240]   fact that there's so many x86 ports of open source applications out there.
[00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:06.720]   Do you think this had anything to do with Apple's decision to switch to the Intel platform?
[00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:07.720]   >> No.
[00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:08.720]   >> No.
[00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:09.720]   >> No.
[00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:11.280]   >> And you know what else?
[00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:15.880]   We also think that IBM claiming that, you know, Apple never asked them for a low power
[00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:19.960]   chip and that they're the three gigahertz chip is just around the corner.
[00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:20.960]   >> That's bogus too.
[00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:25.960]   >> Hi, my name is David from Houston, Texas.
[00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:31.760]   I go to the University of Cincinnati, which requires that I buy a digital camera, but
[00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:35.160]   I also wanted to start learning how to do video editing.
[00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:41.360]   So I'm wondering if there's, I haven't been able to find any combination visual camera
[00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:45.800]   and video camera, good combinations where you get high quality of full.
[00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:50.320]   Do they just not exist and why hasn't my cake on in on this?
[00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:51.320]   All right, thank you.
[00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:54.120]   >> I got an answer to that one.
[00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:55.640]   >> Fire it out.
[00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:57.680]   >> There's a Samsung just roll out a camera.
[00:39:57.680 --> 00:40:00.680]   That's exactly what he described, which is a digital.
[00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:02.360]   It actually has two lenses.
[00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:05.440]   >> Yeah, but the problem is he wants one that's a good digital camera.
[00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:07.800]   Well, it's got two lenses, so it's got one pickup for.
[00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:11.080]   >> It's got, I think it's got, you know, it's actually the, I shot a couple of pictures
[00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:16.040]   but it's not that bad, it's a five megapixel digital camera and then it's also a DV camera.
[00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:17.960]   And it's very, it's in the ball fits in the ball in your hand.
[00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:20.880]   It was, I thought it was reasonable, it was, I guess, like 300, 400 bucks.
[00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:24.320]   >> So it's a lot smaller than the last one they did with the rotating lenses that weighed
[00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:25.560]   like eight pounds.
[00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:26.680]   >> No, no, it's not like that.
[00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:27.960]   These are two fixed lenses.
[00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:29.400]   They're, they're both zooms.
[00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:30.840]   >> Yeah, it's kind of weird.
[00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:31.520]   >> It's a weird looking thing.
[00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:35.960]   >> Yeah, it's weird looking, but it, but that, the reason is because the CCD for a digital
[00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:39.320]   camera has to be much higher resolution than the CCD.
[00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:41.320]   >> For a DV camera.
[00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:42.320]   >> So you're both.
[00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:43.320]   >> Yeah.
[00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:47.320]   >> If somebody would use the Foveon's, uh, C-Moss.
[00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:50.520]   >> What's that deal with, why is nobody going with Foveon?
[00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:54.120]   No, but, and Polarites that they were gonna, um, nothing.
[00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:57.560]   >> They've been, you want to hear what the insiders at the company would tell you?
[00:40:57.560 --> 00:40:58.560]   >> Yeah.
[00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:02.680]   >> They would say that they've been squeezed by the big CCD manufacturers because it's
[00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:05.720]   one of those deals like Intel, you know, you want to buy AMD chips?
[00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:08.680]   Well, maybe you're not gonna be able to get any of our chips at all.
[00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:09.680]   >> Yeah.
[00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:14.360]   >> So there's nobody that can, unless they went 100% Foveon, which nobody's gonna do,
[00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:16.520]   they, they, it becomes like it's all political.
[00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:18.600]   These chip companies are just, they're all set.
[00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:21.600]   >> Well, there was, there was a, who was that camera company that was doing all the Foveon
[00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:22.920]   cameras, the SLR, SIG.
[00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:23.920]   >> Yeah.
[00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:24.920]   >> They were the only one who ever released it.
[00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:25.920]   >> They still do.
[00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:27.600]   >> This is Carver Mead's invention.
[00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:31.200]   Carver Mead's a brilliant physicist and it's a, it's a brilliant idea.
[00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:35.640]   Uh, and it would be a real shame if, uh, these market forces are keeping something that's
[00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:37.760]   a major innovation off the market.
[00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:39.760]   It's kind of sad.
[00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:41.800]   >> Yeah, it's okay.
[00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:43.560]   >> Was, what course is he taking?
[00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:44.560]   >> That it requires us to-
[00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:46.640]   >> That you require him to have a digital camera.
[00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:48.240]   >> Well, that was interesting, yeah.
[00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:52.720]   >> You know, I, one other, uh, a product that's gonna be kind of interesting, this new JVC
[00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:54.720]   Vario, they've been doing a number of solid state-
[00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:55.720]   >> Yeah.
[00:41:55.720 --> 00:41:56.720]   >> Right, I saw that at, uh, CES.
[00:41:56.720 --> 00:41:57.720]   >> Yeah.
[00:41:57.720 --> 00:41:58.720]   >> Yeah.
[00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:00.880]   >> And they have a new one that's a very high resolution that's, I should be out pretty
[00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:01.880]   soon, I think.
[00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:04.000]   >> Is that the CineCam one?
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:07.120]   >> I don't remember the model number, but it was kind of neat.
[00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:10.560]   >> There's a tiny two PMA in Florida.
[00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:13.720]   Uh, yeah, it's, it's solid state DV cam.
[00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:18.400]   I think it has a three or four megapixels still camera, the same lens, very small, I
[00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:20.520]   mean much smaller than a DV cam.
[00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:24.760]   Um, and, and they, they're gonna be using, uh, MPEG-4, high quality MPEG-4, so you get
[00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:26.560]   some decent video out of these things.
[00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:29.840]   You know, up to now the solid state cam quarters are terrible.
[00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:30.840]   >> Yeah.
[00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:33.920]   >> But these, this must be, it looked pretty good, I was a crust.
[00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:36.840]   This is an interesting email we got, I, well, actually there's a recording here.
[00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:40.120]   Let me see if I can, uh, I can extract it.
[00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:42.320]   It says, "Hi guys, I'm a wannabe techie."
[00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:45.200]   And I just listened to your podcast, 16, you guys were talking about podcasts, you should
[00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:46.840]   be thankful you're on iTunes and Musicstar.
[00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:49.520]   I would have never found you otherwise.
[00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:50.680]   But I enjoy the show.
[00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:52.760]   She's an American who lives in Australia.
[00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:57.080]   She's at the Division of Neuroscience, it's John Curtin School of Medical Research, Australian
[00:42:57.080 --> 00:42:59.720]   National University in Acton.
[00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:02.040]   And she listens to our Twitter cast.
[00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:06.160]   And here is, here is her, oh, let me see if I can play her question.
[00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:07.960]   >> Hi there, this is Amy from Australia.
[00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:16.240]   I would like to know, how do websites like audible.com, which sell digital books, security
[00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:24.280]   protect their files, and how do they know when you're, if you log on to someone else's
[00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:29.600]   website, log on as a different user, and try and download their books, how do they know
[00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:33.360]   you're trying to download that book to a different computer?
[00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:35.480]   >> Yeah, that's DRM for you, baby.
[00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:40.320]   >> It ties itself to your, your user ID.
[00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:41.960]   So you have to authorize it in order to listen to it.
[00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:43.960]   >> I cracked all my audible stuff a little.
[00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:47.160]   >> Oh, how do you crack all my, there's an application that does it.
[00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:48.160]   >> It's really easy.
[00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:49.880]   >> Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:55.480]   >> Do we want a traffic in explaining how to bypass copy protection so we can all be sued
[00:43:55.480 --> 00:43:56.480]   under the DMCA?
[00:43:56.480 --> 00:43:57.480]   >> Hell yeah.
[00:43:57.480 --> 00:43:58.480]   How do you say it?
[00:43:58.480 --> 00:44:00.480]   >> Yeah, besides Leo can edit it later.
[00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:04.240]   >> Well, I use JHIM to just strip the stuff out of iTunes.
[00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:06.240]   >> Yeah, so audible uses a different kind of.
[00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:08.000]   >> Right, it's a separate application.
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:09.720]   I'll get the link for it and give it to you.
[00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:11.680]   >> Hit the link, put it on the website.
[00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:13.680]   >> Patrick's worried we're going to get sued because we're.
[00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:15.480]   >> Oh, Patrick's a big weenie.
[00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:19.600]   >> Oh, yeah, that's because I don't have your money for lawyers, John.
[00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:22.480]   >> Oh, we don't need, we don't need our stinking lawyers.
[00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:24.200]   >> We just need to run very fast.
[00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:26.880]   >> No, I've run for other things, Roger.
[00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:29.360]   I'm old and I'm tired and I don't like running.
[00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:31.560]   >> I get you a wheel first.
[00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:33.520]   >> I hit my second win like John has.
[00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:36.960]   John's probably been young and feisty since he was two.
[00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:39.080]   >> We're just all of him crotchety.
[00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:41.480]   >> Andrew Leiden sent me a kind of a cool thing.
[00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:44.880]   This is podcast directory.com/map.
[00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:48.760]   In our RSS feed, I don't know why, but one of the things feed burner lets you do is put
[00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:51.840]   your longitude and latitude in your RSS feed.
[00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:53.480]   So I do.
[00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:58.640]   And this podcast directory.com has locations of all the podcasts on a Google map.
[00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:03.040]   And if you, it's kind of a big cluster in the San Francisco Bay area.
[00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:05.040]   But we're in there.
[00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:06.320]   We're in there.
[00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:09.560]   >> So what's the, what's your, the highest density of podcasts?
[00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:10.560]   >> Well, I know.
[00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:14.880]   I'm looking at California and LA and San Francisco certainly have quite a few.
[00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:16.880]   Podcast directory.com/map.
[00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:18.880]   I don't know.
[00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:23.960]   >> The ebooks that I download from ereader.com, but I put it into my palm pilot.
[00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:24.960]   >> Yeah.
[00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:29.160]   >> They're unlocked by providing them with the credit card number that you use.
[00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:30.160]   >> Oh, interesting.
[00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:34.720]   >> And so, you know, that's something you don't want to divulge to anybody else.
[00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:39.080]   And, you know, so it's sort of a nice way of saying, look, don't share these, but you
[00:45:39.080 --> 00:45:41.960]   know, you want to have access to them on any machine.
[00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:46.600]   When you buy an e-book, you're able to read them on a palm, on a, on a pocket PC, on a
[00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:50.880]   Windows machine, on a Mac or anything else that will run the ereader.
[00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:54.920]   So you do get multi-platform freedom and, you know, you want to keep your credit card
[00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:55.920]   number to yourself.
[00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:57.280]   >> I think that's a good way of solving it.
[00:45:57.280 --> 00:46:01.360]   Right now, with Audible, you have to authorize machines and you're, they don't say what the
[00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:04.480]   limit is, but there's a certain number of machines you can authorize and then it'll
[00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:05.480]   stop.
[00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:06.480]   >> It just feels wrong to do that.
[00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:09.360]   You know, it's like, you know, you, you, you, you purchase a thing, you want to be able
[00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:11.880]   to use it and live and listen to it where you want it.
[00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:12.880]   >> Yeah.
[00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:13.880]   That makes sense.
[00:46:13.880 --> 00:46:16.480]   >> Do you read ebooks on an notebook screen or do you have a handheld device?
[00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:18.480]   >> He's all right.
[00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:19.480]   >> He's PDA.
[00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:20.480]   He does it on PDA.
[00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:21.780]   >> I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm PDA.
[00:46:21.780 --> 00:46:25.520]   I didn't download the, the Windows reader just to sort of see what it looks like and it's
[00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:26.520]   like, uh, pretty cool.
[00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:27.520]   >> It's okay.
[00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:28.520]   I use my tablet PC.
[00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:29.520]   >> Oh, yeah.
[00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:31.720]   >> It's much, yeah, it's going to say, it's much as we make fun of the tablet PC and
[00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:33.560]   that's what I'm really waiting for for that.
[00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:34.560]   >> It's good for that.
[00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:35.560]   >> Yeah, the battery life on the tablet PC.
[00:46:35.560 --> 00:46:40.480]   >> So kind of wireless display or the built in media card reader were with a great looking
[00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:43.120]   screen that can match somewhat, at least as close as possible.
[00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:44.720]   It's a print quality, like on paper.
[00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:49.480]   >> I can't, I can't sit for long periods of time and read from a computer, from an LCD.
[00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:51.120]   When is e-paper coming out?
[00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:52.280]   When, when are we going to see that?
[00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:53.280]   >> Oh, yeah.
[00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:58.960]   >> Yeah, the one decent e-paper based digital book is the Sony Libre and the only way you're
[00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:00.800]   getting it is importing it.
[00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:03.200]   Because they seem to have no interest in selling it over here.
[00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:07.000]   >> You know, a paperback book is pretty much a near perfect delivery mechanism.
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:09.640]   It's cheap, it's effective, it's portable.
[00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:11.280]   >> I know you can recite it.
[00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:12.600]   >> The batteries won't run out.
[00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:16.840]   >> I mean, you don't really, you know, the only drawback is you have to have one per
[00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:17.840]   book.
[00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:18.840]   >> Yeah.
[00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:19.840]   >> Yeah, I've seen the Libre, yeah.
[00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:22.840]   >> Yeah, you would have just one device and you could have, you know, 50% of the battery
[00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:24.440]   is going to go 50 bucks with you at one time.
[00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:25.440]   >> Well, I think it's going to happen.
[00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:26.440]   I mean, you know, I'm--
[00:47:26.440 --> 00:47:28.080]   >> 50 bucks at once.
[00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:32.560]   >> Well, I have on my iPod, because I listen to books on tab, tons of portable books, I
[00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:35.000]   have probably 20 or 30 Audible books on there.
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:36.000]   And you know, I'll just jump around.
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:38.360]   I'm listening to 1776 right now, that's great.
[00:47:38.360 --> 00:47:39.360]   >> Good book.
[00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:40.360]   >> David McCullough.
[00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:44.760]   You know, have any of you guys ever read any Steven Baxter science fiction?
[00:47:44.760 --> 00:47:45.760]   >> No, no, no.
[00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:46.760]   >> I have.
[00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:47.760]   >> I love it.
[00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:48.760]   >> Yeah.
[00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:49.760]   >> What?
[00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:53.520]   >> This guy is an aerospace-- former aerospace engineer, he's brilliant guy.
[00:47:53.520 --> 00:47:54.520]   >> Yeah.
[00:47:54.520 --> 00:47:55.800]   >> Very, very good writer.
[00:47:55.800 --> 00:47:59.440]   And he writes, I think, some of the most intelligent, interesting science fiction out there.
[00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:01.200]   >> Yeah, really good, hard sci-fi.
[00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:02.440]   >> Hard sci-fi, yeah.
[00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:03.440]   >> Cool.
[00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:10.560]   >> Evolution is maybe not the most plot compelling book, but a fascinating idea.
[00:48:10.560 --> 00:48:15.040]   The book starts with the comet that hits the planet and kills the dinosaurs and ends 10
[00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:19.200]   million years in the future when the last hominids finally die out.
[00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:22.360]   It's an amazing, amazing book.
[00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:26.120]   And I'm reading coalescent now, which I think is really beautifully written.
[00:48:26.120 --> 00:48:29.120]   He's a philosopher as well as I think is a very good scientist.
[00:48:29.120 --> 00:48:32.240]   >> And when we're off topic, is anybody rented?
[00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:36.560]   We just went through the whole DVD collection of the short-lived series Firefly.
[00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:37.560]   >> Yeah.
[00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:39.560]   >> Oh, don't get Patrick started.
[00:48:39.560 --> 00:48:40.920]   >> That thing is fantastic.
[00:48:40.920 --> 00:48:41.920]   >> It's amazing.
[00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:45.280]   But do you know the story on what Fox did do?
[00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:48.800]   >> Before you give me that story, let me just say, this thing ran what?
[00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:51.160]   >> Two years ago, I never heard of this show.
[00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:53.960]   I mean, what kind of audience are working at Fox?
[00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:55.840]   >> Well, tell them what happened.
[00:48:55.840 --> 00:48:57.440]   >> Okay, so what happens, right?
[00:48:57.440 --> 00:49:02.520]   Do you know the producer, the brains behind Firefly, do you know what his background is?
[00:49:02.520 --> 00:49:03.680]   >> They did Buffy.
[00:49:03.680 --> 00:49:04.680]   >> Yeah.
[00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:09.040]   And so, they saw the initial.
[00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:15.880]   So what you saw is the premiere or the opening, the pilot episode, that two-hour opening episode,
[00:49:15.880 --> 00:49:17.200]   they showed that 11th.
[00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:20.880]   If you look at the back of the DVDs, they show the actual order they were broadcast in.
[00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:22.800]   And the last two or three were never even broadcast.
[00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:24.920]   >> The morons at Fox didn't understand it.
[00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:26.640]   They carried it out of order.
[00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:30.560]   >> And it was playing too well on Friday nights with adult women.
[00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:32.440]   And that wasn't the audience they wanted.
[00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:37.320]   So they, but they, he made them that second episode where they're robbing the train robbing
[00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:39.320]   episode.
[00:49:39.320 --> 00:49:42.520]   That was the premiere episode, which, so everybody saw that and they're like, what's
[00:49:42.520 --> 00:49:43.520]   going on?
[00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:47.400]   Why is this, what is this space opera western thing?
[00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:51.360]   >> Well, I have to say this, if anything, if anything, deserved to kill the show was
[00:49:51.360 --> 00:49:57.760]   the soundtrack, that theme, like, which was only topped as bad by that Star Trek enterprise.
[00:49:57.760 --> 00:50:00.760]   >> That was just going to say, that was a second worst theme song.
[00:50:00.760 --> 00:50:04.280]   >> No, this was the far fly one, I think is actually worse than that.
[00:50:04.280 --> 00:50:06.920]   But this thing should have gone, it should have been a syndicated show.
[00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:08.520]   What did they run it through Fox for?
[00:50:08.520 --> 00:50:10.520]   Fox was total idiots.
[00:50:10.520 --> 00:50:12.480]   I mean, I was stunned by this show.
[00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:14.680]   >> So this is like a, a must rent DVD.
[00:50:14.680 --> 00:50:16.760]   >> It's, it's, it's really good.
[00:50:16.760 --> 00:50:19.280]   >> It could have been a character development is phenomenal.
[00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:21.400]   >> And the, and the movie of course is on its way.
[00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:23.960]   When is that kind of, this fall, this fall.
[00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:25.520]   So that's exciting.
[00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:28.760]   >> And, and Leo, do you remember that last time I came up visited you in Toronto, I
[00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:35.360]   had the entire DVD set on two one gig SD chips and was watching the episodes on the plane.
[00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:37.360]   >> This man is mad.
[00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:40.160]   What do you, what do you use for compression?
[00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:44.880]   >> The, the compressor does a really, really good job.
[00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:45.400]   >> Divics.
[00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:49.480]   >> And there's not, there's player for the pocket PC and
[00:50:49.480 --> 00:50:56.080]   that you know allows time frame per second play back and perfect.
[00:50:56.080 --> 00:50:58.120]   >> Speaking of Toronto, I want to update people.
[00:50:58.120 --> 00:51:00.320]   We are going to do a Toronto meet up.
[00:51:00.320 --> 00:51:02.280]   Kevin will be there, I will be there.
[00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:06.680]   Amber and Andy will be there, Michael be there.
[00:51:06.680 --> 00:51:08.800]   We're going to be doing it 730 at no regrets.
[00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:11.120]   That's this Thursday, August 11th.
[00:51:11.120 --> 00:51:14.680]   And please go to meetup.com and RSVP.
[00:51:14.680 --> 00:51:16.760]   We have how many do our RSVPs.
[00:51:16.760 --> 00:51:19.520]   >> Over a hundred and a hundred and sixty some now.
[00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:20.600]   >> We can get plenty more.
[00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:21.320]   >> Yeah.
[00:51:21.320 --> 00:51:23.360]   >> Yeah, I actually talked to Alex Albrecht and coming to.
[00:51:23.360 --> 00:51:24.200]   >> So he's going to go there.
[00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:25.200]   >> Alex is coming?
[00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:25.800]   >> Yeah, he's coming.
[00:51:25.800 --> 00:51:26.200]   >> You can't, no.
[00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:28.200]   We're going to shoot an episode of Dignation up there as well.
[00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:29.040]   So he's going to go.
[00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:29.440]   >> Patrick, are you going to come on?
[00:51:29.440 --> 00:51:30.200]   >> Patrick has to go.
[00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:30.680]   >> Come on.
[00:51:30.680 --> 00:51:31.920]   >> I just started a new job.
[00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:32.600]   >> Patrick.
[00:51:32.600 --> 00:51:33.560]   >> All right.
[00:51:33.560 --> 00:51:34.480]   >> We'll, we'll see.
[00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:37.800]   >> Well, there's another chance everybody could meet us and I might as well make the announcement.
[00:51:37.800 --> 00:51:42.880]   Now we're going to start doing, and this show will probably be the end of the reason we're going to do this.
[00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:44.480]   The audio on this is so awful.
[00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:50.560]   We're going to be doing it live in, in a, in a, Noonan's restaurant, NOON's restaurant.
[00:51:50.560 --> 00:51:56.200]   It's on Larkspur Landing in Larkspur, California starting September 18th at 4 p.m.
[00:51:56.200 --> 00:52:00.080]   We'll broadcast, well, we'll podcast, record it live.
[00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:03.480]   Actually, we may have a deal to do a broadcast as well.
[00:52:03.480 --> 00:52:06.720]   And we're inviting people to come and join us.
[00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:12.000]   It's one of the reasons we chose NOON's is it's right off the San Francisco Larkspur ferry.
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:16.080]   So you can, if you're staying in the city, you can take the ferry over a beautiful ride
[00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:18.320]   and be there four o'clock Sunday afternoon.
[00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:22.960]   It's also equidistant from you guys in San Francisco, me up here in Petaluma.
[00:52:22.960 --> 00:52:23.440]   >> Right.
[00:52:23.440 --> 00:52:26.000]   >> John and Robert in the East Bay.
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:28.960]   So please, everybody come on out.
[00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:32.440]   We'd love to see you September, starting September 18th, and I think every Sunday thereafter,
[00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:34.160]   unless we, unless we decide this.
[00:52:34.160 --> 00:52:36.040]   >> I'll bring the camera to so we can shoot it.
[00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:37.200]   I would love to get you online.
[00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:39.000]   >> I would love to get online video of this.
[00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:40.000]   So this is exciting.
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:41.000]   >> I can bring you camera.
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:43.760]   >> This is the next stage of development, it's weird.
[00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:45.440]   And I think it's going to sound a little bit better.
[00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:48.400]   I think of it, John, I think you'll recognize this.
[00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:54.040]   I'm thinking of it as the Algonquin Roundtable of the, of the geek generation.
[00:52:54.040 --> 00:52:57.960]   >> Yeah, that's one way of looking at it.
[00:52:57.960 --> 00:53:02.760]   >> All right, shut down.
[00:53:02.760 --> 00:53:05.160]   >> Hileo, Hileo, Hileo.
[00:53:05.160 --> 00:53:07.760]   This is Mark, this is Mark.
[00:53:07.760 --> 00:53:09.760]   I really enjoyed the episode 15.
[00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:11.560]   I really enjoyed the episode 15.
[00:53:11.560 --> 00:53:12.560]   >> It's so hard.
[00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:13.560]   I know where he's going with it.
[00:53:13.560 --> 00:53:15.520]   >> The echo was very entertaining.
[00:53:15.520 --> 00:53:16.680]   The echo was very entertaining.
[00:53:16.680 --> 00:53:19.120]   >> All right, I get the idea.
[00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:22.760]   >> No echo in this edition.
[00:53:22.760 --> 00:53:25.960]   >> There were some significant audio problems with that episode.
[00:53:25.960 --> 00:53:29.560]   Between the whining, somebody was breathing into their microphone close to the time.
[00:53:29.560 --> 00:53:32.560]   >> You know, the last episode 16 was good.
[00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:36.960]   And it was because it was just a handful of small number of people.
[00:53:36.960 --> 00:53:39.760]   And that Skype works much better with small number of people.
[00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:40.760]   And I can control it better.
[00:53:40.760 --> 00:53:43.960]   But that's one of the reasons we're doing this live, is because you'll all be in the
[00:53:43.960 --> 00:53:46.880]   same room and we can control it.
[00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:48.120]   I think they'll sound much much.
[00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:50.720]   >> On a set of regular speakers, it wasn't so bad.
[00:53:50.720 --> 00:53:54.440]   But when I had my headphones on listening on a small player, everything just seemed
[00:53:54.440 --> 00:53:59.720]   to end up focusing on the noises in the background or electronics distortions.
[00:53:59.720 --> 00:54:00.720]   >> Wait, wait, wait.
[00:54:00.720 --> 00:54:02.200]   You hear this one, Robert.
[00:54:02.200 --> 00:54:07.440]   But I am going to run this through sound soap and see if it sounds any better.
[00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:11.040]   There are a couple of plug-ins out there that are -- who's typing?
[00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:15.040]   Is that before I think it's before I -- listen to him, see?
[00:54:15.040 --> 00:54:17.440]   That's the problem is we can't control you monkeys.
[00:54:17.440 --> 00:54:21.080]   So if you're all in the same room, I can at least say something.
[00:54:21.080 --> 00:54:22.280]   >> I'm blogging.
[00:54:22.280 --> 00:54:24.280]   Get him the t-shirt.
[00:54:24.280 --> 00:54:26.280]   Come on, please.
[00:54:26.280 --> 00:54:29.280]   >> My name is Chris from Sherman Oaks.
[00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:31.280]   I need to talk to buy an iBook.
[00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:36.280]   And it's not scary because I'm a computer repairman and I only know Windows.
[00:54:36.280 --> 00:54:40.280]   Now everyone raves about Mac, but what are the downsides, Mike?
[00:54:40.280 --> 00:54:41.280]   >> What are the downsides?
[00:54:41.280 --> 00:54:42.280]   We never talk about that.
[00:54:42.280 --> 00:54:43.280]   >> Of a Mac?
[00:54:43.280 --> 00:54:44.280]   >> Yeah, nothing.
[00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:46.280]   >> Oh, that's not true.
[00:54:46.280 --> 00:54:50.280]   What about the entire generation of iBooks that disintegrated and it took months before
[00:54:50.280 --> 00:54:51.280]   I had one.
[00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:56.280]   >> And I still -- >> We're firmware updates for the different
[00:54:56.280 --> 00:54:59.280]   models of your own name.
[00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:00.280]   >> No, there aren't.
[00:55:00.280 --> 00:55:02.280]   I think now they're okay.
[00:55:02.280 --> 00:55:03.280]   Don't you think?
[00:55:03.280 --> 00:55:05.280]   >> Yeah, I think they're great.
[00:55:05.280 --> 00:55:06.280]   The prices just came down.
[00:55:06.280 --> 00:55:08.280]   They just upped the processors.
[00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:10.280]   Okay, what do you run into?
[00:55:10.280 --> 00:55:13.280]   In a few years, Apple will draw a line and your hardware will no longer be supported with
[00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:15.280]   the new operating system.
[00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:17.280]   No, that pretty much happens every few years.
[00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:20.280]   I don't see why they're going to back away from that now.
[00:55:20.280 --> 00:55:24.280]   >> There is some incredible flaw in the hardware.
[00:55:24.280 --> 00:55:28.280]   It may take them incredibly long time to own up to it, but eventually we hope they will
[00:55:28.280 --> 00:55:29.280]   fix it.
[00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:34.280]   Like they did with the problem with the chips on the motherboards for the screens and the
[00:55:34.280 --> 00:55:35.280]   iBooks.
[00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:39.280]   Other than that, they'll pretty much -- you have to do something really creative, like
[00:55:39.280 --> 00:55:43.280]   physically break the computer, because it's almost impossible to do anything in software
[00:55:43.280 --> 00:55:44.280]   that will mess the computer up.
[00:55:44.280 --> 00:55:45.280]   >> Yeah, I think it's very robust.
[00:55:45.280 --> 00:55:46.280]   >> At least compare it to a Windows box.
[00:55:46.280 --> 00:55:47.280]   >> Yeah, it's very robust.
[00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:48.280]   >> Yeah.
[00:55:48.280 --> 00:55:50.280]   >> Yeah.
[00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:51.280]   >> Right.
[00:55:51.280 --> 00:55:53.280]   >> Anybody else want any other negatives?
[00:55:53.280 --> 00:55:54.280]   Any other reasons?
[00:55:54.280 --> 00:55:59.280]   We could go on and on about spyware and viruses and so forth, not being part of the problem.
[00:55:59.280 --> 00:56:02.280]   >> If you're gaming on a gaming basis.
[00:56:02.280 --> 00:56:04.280]   >> There are no games for the Mac.
[00:56:04.280 --> 00:56:06.280]   >> Hey, I play World of Warcraft on my Mac and works great.
[00:56:06.280 --> 00:56:07.280]   >> There's games out there.
[00:56:07.280 --> 00:56:09.280]   You're not going to play them on an iBook.
[00:56:09.280 --> 00:56:11.280]   >> I play World of Warcraft on my PowerBook.
[00:56:11.280 --> 00:56:12.280]   >> But that's it.
[00:56:12.280 --> 00:56:14.280]   >> But the only phrase, you're not going to play --
[00:56:14.280 --> 00:56:15.280]   >> Half-life.
[00:56:15.280 --> 00:56:16.280]   >> Yeah, high-end 3D games on it.
[00:56:16.280 --> 00:56:19.280]   >> So, yeah, I want that age of the empires to agree when it comes out.
[00:56:19.280 --> 00:56:21.280]   >> But, I mean, that's true, by the way, of PC notebooks.
[00:56:21.280 --> 00:56:23.280]   There's very few that'll play 3D games well.
[00:56:23.280 --> 00:56:24.280]   >> Agreed.
[00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:25.280]   >> I mean, that's just a notebook.
[00:56:25.280 --> 00:56:26.280]   >> Hey, everyone.
[00:56:26.280 --> 00:56:28.280]   This is Rick from Redmond, Washington.
[00:56:28.280 --> 00:56:29.280]   >> Oh, we know where Rick works.
[00:56:29.280 --> 00:56:34.280]   >> We have a wondering what your favorite wireless router Grand was.
[00:56:34.280 --> 00:56:40.280]   I'm shopping for a new one, and I was looking at the D-Link, Di624.
[00:56:40.280 --> 00:56:43.280]   >> Does everybody who lives in Redmond have to work at Microsoft?
[00:56:43.280 --> 00:56:44.280]   Are there people who actually don't?
[00:56:44.280 --> 00:56:46.280]   >> Well, somebody's got to sell him coffee.
[00:56:46.280 --> 00:56:49.280]   >> It's either the coffee guy or he works at Microsoft.
[00:56:49.280 --> 00:56:53.280]   >> I used to like Linksis, but I don't anymore.
[00:56:53.280 --> 00:56:54.280]   >> I'm hearing bad stuff.
[00:56:54.280 --> 00:56:55.280]   >> Yeah.
[00:56:55.280 --> 00:57:01.280]   >> The Linksis has an air-go-based pre-end wireless router.
[00:57:01.280 --> 00:57:04.280]   You'll get more distance and more speed, and they're backward compatible.
[00:57:04.280 --> 00:57:05.280]   They work great.
[00:57:05.280 --> 00:57:06.280]   Get the Belkin.
[00:57:06.280 --> 00:57:07.280]   >> Yeah.
[00:57:07.280 --> 00:57:08.280]   >> I agree.
[00:57:08.280 --> 00:57:09.280]   I would agree on that.
[00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:11.280]   >> Oh, Linksis makes an air-go-based pre-end as well.
[00:57:11.280 --> 00:57:13.280]   >> Is the build quality good on that Belkin?
[00:57:13.280 --> 00:57:15.280]   >> Apparently, everybody I know loves it.
[00:57:15.280 --> 00:57:16.280]   >> I'm running it now.
[00:57:16.280 --> 00:57:17.280]   It's fantastic.
[00:57:17.280 --> 00:57:18.280]   >> Yeah, we had one on call for help.
[00:57:18.280 --> 00:57:19.280]   We were very happy.
[00:57:19.280 --> 00:57:27.280]   >> And they have a very nice, kind of a way, kind of a setup that works very for people
[00:57:27.280 --> 00:57:31.280]   who don't like to know how to set these things up and don't want to go into the router.
[00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:33.280]   I think the setup is one of the best I've ever seen.
[00:57:33.280 --> 00:57:34.280]   >> You know what they've got now in the Linksis?
[00:57:34.280 --> 00:57:38.280]   They've got a button on the front that you push that says secure this router.
[00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:39.280]   >> Yeah.
[00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:40.280]   I don't know what it does.
[00:57:40.280 --> 00:57:41.280]   >> It turns it off.
[00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:43.280]   >> It turns it off.
[00:57:43.280 --> 00:57:45.280]   >> Which model is that?
[00:57:45.280 --> 00:57:46.280]   >> I don't know.
[00:57:46.280 --> 00:57:47.280]   >> I just saw that.
[00:57:47.280 --> 00:57:51.280]   >> You had to say the other day, you press the button, or no, I best buy, you press the button.
[00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:52.280]   It's got this security button.
[00:57:52.280 --> 00:57:54.280]   >> You press it and you're secure.
[00:57:54.280 --> 00:57:55.280]   What could that be?
[00:57:55.280 --> 00:57:56.280]   It must turn on web.
[00:57:56.280 --> 00:57:58.280]   Oh, I know why.
[00:57:58.280 --> 00:58:04.280]   You have to buy the matching Linksis device for your other -- and they all have the button.
[00:58:04.280 --> 00:58:07.280]   So it's turning on web with some password that everybody knows.
[00:58:07.280 --> 00:58:10.280]   >> That's because for the average user, these routers are so --
[00:58:10.280 --> 00:58:11.280]   >> It's a complicated.
[00:58:11.280 --> 00:58:12.280]   >> It's complicated.
[00:58:12.280 --> 00:58:15.280]   But I tell you what, if you're looking for an advanced router and you want to stay away
[00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:17.280]   from the pre-end stuff, I really like Netgear.
[00:58:17.280 --> 00:58:18.280]   They have some really cool options.
[00:58:18.280 --> 00:58:21.280]   If you're getting port scanned, it will email you and let you know.
[00:58:21.280 --> 00:58:22.280]   >> That's so nice.
[00:58:22.280 --> 00:58:24.280]   >> There's some cool stuff Netgear has built in.
[00:58:24.280 --> 00:58:29.280]   >> Netgear and the others, too, have done a much better job with the configuration menu
[00:58:29.280 --> 00:58:30.280]   John was mentioning.
[00:58:30.280 --> 00:58:33.280]   They also immediately check the firmware for you and make it very easy to download and
[00:58:33.280 --> 00:58:35.280]   upgrade the devices themselves.
[00:58:35.280 --> 00:58:39.280]   >> Let me ask you a question about this pre-end stuff.
[00:58:39.280 --> 00:58:44.280]   If I have all-B equipment, do I have to upgrade it to get the advantage of the pre-end?
[00:58:44.280 --> 00:58:46.280]   I know I won't get the speed, but will I get it?
[00:58:46.280 --> 00:58:48.280]   >> I will get more distance.
[00:58:48.280 --> 00:58:49.280]   >> Yeah.
[00:58:49.280 --> 00:58:51.280]   >> But you won't get any more speed, no.
[00:58:51.280 --> 00:58:55.280]   >> Has anyone tested in real life how fast is pre-end?
[00:58:55.280 --> 00:59:00.280]   If I drag and drop a huge ISO file to somebody else, it's on a wireless network.
[00:59:00.280 --> 00:59:02.280]   How fast are we talking?
[00:59:02.280 --> 00:59:03.280]   >> Hunter Megabit.
[00:59:03.280 --> 00:59:04.280]   >> Hunter Megabit?
[00:59:04.280 --> 00:59:06.280]   >> If you're close, you have to be within a few hundred feet.
[00:59:06.280 --> 00:59:07.280]   >> Yeah.
[00:59:07.280 --> 00:59:08.280]   >> That's nice.
[00:59:08.280 --> 00:59:09.280]   >> I'll throw it out.
[00:59:09.280 --> 00:59:10.280]   You still get your pretty damn good speed.
[00:59:10.280 --> 00:59:12.280]   It'll give you better speed than anything else.
[00:59:12.280 --> 00:59:13.280]   >> Oh, it's awesome.
[00:59:13.280 --> 00:59:16.280]   >> Late in season lesson, the distance is better.
[00:59:16.280 --> 00:59:17.280]   Those are the two big things.
[00:59:17.280 --> 00:59:18.280]   >> That's great.
[00:59:18.280 --> 00:59:19.280]   >> Maimo is a huge breakthrough.
[00:59:19.280 --> 00:59:22.280]   >> Hey, how is everybody doing?
[00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:25.280]   This is on Twitter @yahoo.com.
[00:59:25.280 --> 00:59:26.280]   >> Wow.
[00:59:26.280 --> 00:59:27.280]   >> He's back again.
[00:59:27.280 --> 00:59:29.280]   >> It's good, Commander.
[00:59:29.280 --> 00:59:32.280]   >> Kids, one question a month, okay?
[00:59:32.280 --> 00:59:34.280]   >> I can identify him, though.
[00:59:34.280 --> 00:59:37.280]   >> Well, yeah, thank you for seeing your name up front so we can put it on the screen.
[00:59:37.280 --> 00:59:38.280]   >> That's handy.
[00:59:38.280 --> 00:59:39.280]   Let's see.
[00:59:39.280 --> 00:59:40.280]   I don't think we've heard for Michael.
[00:59:40.280 --> 00:59:41.280]   >> Hey, guys.
[00:59:41.280 --> 00:59:42.280]   I have the podcast.
[00:59:42.280 --> 00:59:43.280]   Keep up the good work.
[00:59:43.280 --> 00:59:44.280]   Just a quick question for you.
[00:59:44.280 --> 00:59:47.280]   I am wondering what kind of recommendations you would have for a mid price range cell phone.
[00:59:47.280 --> 00:59:52.280]   I'm looking for something to replace my dying Tony Erickson T610.
[00:59:52.280 --> 00:59:54.280]   >> What's a good cell phone?
[00:59:54.280 --> 00:59:55.280]   Let's just go around and see what people use.
[00:59:55.280 --> 00:59:57.280]   What do you use it now, Kevin?
[00:59:57.280 --> 01:00:02.280]   >> Right now I have the Samsung from Verizon with the built in 1.2 megapixel camera.
[01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:04.280]   It's the same as the Samsung.
[01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:09.280]   >> That's supposed to be really nice.
[01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:10.280]   >> It's nice.
[01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:11.280]   The camera is amazing.
[01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:13.280]   The video is not too bad either.
[01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:19.280]   >> I was all excited about the new LG 8100 because it's got the little mp3 playing buttons on it.
[01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:21.280]   It's got a 1.3 meg camera and everything.
[01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:22.280]   I called Verizon.
[01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:25.280]   They said, "Oh, we haven't enabled the music playing yet."
[01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:26.280]   >> Ah.
[01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:29.280]   >> So you get this phone with the buttons on it, but then do nothing.
[01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:31.280]   >> There's got to be a hack for that, though.
[01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:34.280]   >> Well, I think they're trying to figure out how to fix it.
[01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:35.280]   >> Firmware hacks can be really --
[01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:36.280]   >> It's risky.
[01:00:36.280 --> 01:00:39.280]   >> Firmware hacks on cell phones either work really well or they do a horrible thing.
[01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:43.280]   >> What's that application like PIM something you guys know what I'm talking about for hacking the cell phones?
[01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:45.280]   >> But it's only for certain models of cell phones.
[01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:46.280]   >> Yeah.
[01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:47.280]   What does it do?
[01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:48.280]   Unlock it?
[01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:49.280]   >> Yeah.
[01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:52.280]   It allows you to hook up the data cable to your cell phone and it works with just a ton of different cell phones.
[01:00:52.280 --> 01:01:00.280]   >> It does everything from allow you to write your email because it's supposed to work with the VX-6100, the LG phone I have, but it wouldn't recognize the phone.
[01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:01.280]   >> It's changed.
[01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:04.280]   >> So, you know, it's all my other computer.
[01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:06.280]   I can't pick the name of it.
[01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:08.280]   >> What do you use, John?
[01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:09.280]   Do you use a cell phone?
[01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:10.280]   No, that's right.
[01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:11.280]   You're not a cell phone user.
[01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:14.280]   >> I got a bunch of them, but you know, they're all motors.
[01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:18.280]   >> I just buy the cheapest cell phone that'll do what I need it to do.
[01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:20.280]   >> I like my sidekick too.
[01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:21.280]   I'd still recommend that.
[01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:23.280]   I think the keyboard on that is nice.
[01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:25.280]   It's got a- >> Are they still making emails?
[01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:27.280]   >> That is the razor for Motorola.
[01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:29.280]   That's a very nice phone.
[01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:30.280]   >> It's pretty.
[01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:31.280]   >> I don't know.
[01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:33.280]   I got some friends that just bought two of those.
[01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:35.280]   They're real divided on them.
[01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:37.280]   I think they break really fast.
[01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:38.280]   How about you, Roger?
[01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:39.280]   What do you use in traffic?
[01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:44.280]   >> I use this Motorola piece of junk until my contract is up and then I'm going to find something.
[01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:45.280]   >> Yeah.
[01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:48.280]   >> Roger recommends the Motorola POG 32.
[01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:58.280]   >> Well, the biggest plus is it's a GSM phone, so if I can pop out the SIM and get a decent phone, but I'm one of those- I'm like Patrick.
[01:01:58.280 --> 01:02:01.280]   It does what I needed to do and I don't want to spend more money than I have to.
[01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:02.280]   >> Hey, we got an answer.
[01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:04.280]   Oh, I didn't ask Steve Gibson.
[01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:05.280]   What do you use Steve?
[01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:06.280]   >> I use the Motorola razor.
[01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:07.280]   >> He's a razorman.
[01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:08.280]   >> Yep, I like it.
[01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:09.280]   >> Happy with it?
[01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:11.280]   >> I'm not a major phone user.
[01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:17.280]   It's sitting by the door with the battery out of it because it tends to drain the battery slowly.
[01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:19.280]   And so I stick it in and come to Toronto.
[01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:21.280]   Otherwise, I just do it not much.
[01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:23.280]   >> I got some advice for you, Steve.
[01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:25.280]   Put it in the freezer.
[01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:27.280]   >> I'm just going to say.
[01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:28.280]   [ Laughter ]
[01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:30.280]   >> We got to answer this next one.
[01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:32.280]   This guy, Mike, is a police officer in Brooklyn.
[01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:35.280]   He says, "If you don't answer, I'm going to put a warrant out for your arrests."
[01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:37.280]   >> Hi, my name is Mike from Brooklyn, New York.
[01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:39.280]   I'm a police officer for the NYPD.
[01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:44.280]   My question is, I'm looking for a program that will let me do a partial word search within Word documents.
[01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:47.280]   We have a large database of information, but everything is hyperlinked.
[01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:50.280]   And if I'm over file, we end up losing the hyperlink.
[01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:51.280]   I tried MSN.
[01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:52.280]   I tried Google.
[01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:53.280]   I tried Yahoo.
[01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:54.280]   I tried a program.
[01:02:54.280 --> 01:02:56.280]   I tried a program called this metadata only.
[01:02:56.280 --> 01:03:00.280]   I'm going to do full word searches and have a hot time finding anything that way.
[01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:03.280]   >> I use X1, which is the Yahoo desktop search.
[01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:05.280]   And you type the first three letters.
[01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:07.280]   It finds the first three letters.
[01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:09.280]   It doesn't require that it be a full word.
[01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:10.280]   So I don't know.
[01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:13.280]   Maybe the Yahoo version does do full words only.
[01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:14.280]   But Mike, I think you can use X1.
[01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:15.280]   >> How does spotlight work?
[01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:17.280]   Does it -- does it -- does it -- does it work?
[01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:19.280]   >> No, spot -- well, let's see.
[01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:20.280]   >> No.
[01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:23.280]   Yeah, see, it's not -- well, of course he's on a PC.
[01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:24.280]   >> I think X1 --
[01:03:24.280 --> 01:03:26.280]   >> You see, he's talking about reading documents online.
[01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:29.280]   He's talking about searching his computer.
[01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:33.280]   >> He wants to search in the document without actually having to open it up.
[01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:34.280]   >> Inside the text.
[01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:35.280]   That's what X1 --
[01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:37.280]   >> Let's just say if it was within the web page Firefox built in.
[01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:38.280]   >> That's really cool.
[01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:39.280]   >> Yeah.
[01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:40.280]   >> It's key by key.
[01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:42.280]   >> Yeah, and that's how X1 works.
[01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:43.280]   And it's super -- I love X1.
[01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:44.280]   X1.com.
[01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:45.280]   I think that's really a great product.
[01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:47.280]   I think that'll do what you want.
[01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:49.280]   You could certainly try it before you buy it.
[01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:50.280]   >> This will slow down your machine.
[01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:52.280]   You're talking about on a PC here?
[01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:53.280]   >> Yeah, on a PC.
[01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:59.280]   You know, I did take it off my tablet PC because I thought that it might be slowing it down.
[01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:03.280]   Yeah, it slows it down when it's indexing as any search program.
[01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:04.280]   >> That will.
[01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:08.280]   >> I was using blinks for a while, but it seems they have all kinds of problems.
[01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:11.280]   I did it a second time I tried using it.
[01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:12.280]   You know, it died.
[01:04:12.280 --> 01:04:16.280]   I mean, essentially stopped indexing after I got to so many files.
[01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:18.280]   I got like 200,000 files.
[01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:21.280]   >> I think X1's been doing this longer than anybody, and they really seemed to know their
[01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:22.280]   stuff.
[01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:24.280]   They've gone, by the way, they now have an enterprise search.
[01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:26.280]   I think that's going to be a huge category.
[01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:30.280]   This searches across all the computers on your network.
[01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:35.280]   I think -- and the whole point of this is people got so much stuff and they cannot organize
[01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:36.280]   it anymore.
[01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:38.280]   You know, it's like moving from Yahoo to Google.
[01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:39.280]   >> Which one was that?
[01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:40.280]   >> X1.com.
[01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:42.280]   They have an enterprise now.
[01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:45.280]   >> We'll all check it out.
[01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:46.280]   >> Okay.
[01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:47.280]   Well, you could try it for free.
[01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:49.280]   The Yahoo desktop search is using X1.
[01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:50.280]   >> Yeah.
[01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:52.280]   >> Yeah, but maybe it's not as free.
[01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:55.280]   Maybe it's not as capable as the $50 X1.
[01:04:55.280 --> 01:04:56.280]   >> Yeah.
[01:04:56.280 --> 01:04:58.280]   >> By the way, I got to warn you.
[01:04:58.280 --> 01:05:02.280]   I don't have to warn you because you're sober, but all the rest of the guys.
[01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:07.280]   This new NINs, they have a full bar with all sorts of exotic spirits.
[01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:11.280]   Of course, it's a brew pup, and they're very famous for their old dipsy barley wine.
[01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:12.280]   >> Barley wine.
[01:05:12.280 --> 01:05:15.280]   >> I will buy you all around a whole dipsy barley wine.
[01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:16.280]   >> Have you ever had barley wine?
[01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:19.280]   >> No, but I understand this will knock you on your piece.
[01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:21.280]   >> It's a very strong way to barley.
[01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:22.280]   >> Exactly.
[01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:25.280]   >> Barley wines like cider, people who normally are quiet and gentle and humane creatures
[01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:29.280]   start bar fights with rugby teams after drinking like...
[01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:31.280]   >> Ladies and gentlemen, September 18th.
[01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:32.280]   >> This isn't a fun one.
[01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:34.280]   >> If there's a riot, you'll hardly win.
[01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:35.280]   >> Barley wines on the house.
[01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:36.280]   >> Barley wine.
[01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:37.280]   >> I'm going to play for everybody.
[01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:38.280]   >> Does that sound good to me?
[01:05:38.280 --> 01:05:39.280]   >> Does it?
[01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:40.280]   All right, we'll get you something else.
[01:05:40.280 --> 01:05:41.280]   >> Does anybody here use plaque so?
[01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:42.280]   Does everybody here trust plaque so?
[01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:44.280]   >> I hate plaque so I can't give you an email.
[01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:45.280]   >> No.
[01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:46.280]   >> I can't give you an email to people who use it.
[01:05:46.280 --> 01:05:47.280]   >> I can't give you an email to people who use it.
[01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:48.280]   >> I ignore those.
[01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:50.280]   >> I don't want my information.
[01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:56.280]   It seems like a great way to centralize all of my information and give it to people I don't want.
[01:05:56.280 --> 01:05:57.280]   >> I can link it in.
[01:05:57.280 --> 01:05:59.280]   >> Yeah, but LinkedIn you can trust.
[01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:01.280]   >> Yeah, but LinkedIn isn't a little different.
[01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:02.280]   >> Yeah, it's a little different.
[01:06:02.280 --> 01:06:04.280]   >> Somebody going, I have to update my PIM.
[01:06:04.280 --> 01:06:08.280]   Would you please send me all your information through this third party?
[01:06:08.280 --> 01:06:12.280]   >> David Corsi sends me a plaque so request every three weeks.
[01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:14.280]   >> Still talk to him?
[01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:16.280]   >> No, he doesn't have my information.
[01:06:16.280 --> 01:06:18.280]   >> I refuse it.
[01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:20.280]   >> Actually, I'm left working with him on --
[01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:21.280]   >> No, David's a great guy.
[01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:22.280]   We should get him on Twitter.
[01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:23.280]   >> He's exact.
[01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:27.280]   He would be the Alexander Wilcott of the -- oh, I'm now really gone.
[01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:29.280]   >> For all of those of you who don't --
[01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:33.280]   >> I'm Jefferson Collin from Cura Show, Netherlands, and Tilly's.
[01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:36.280]   And I'm planning on buying a new flat screen.
[01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:43.280]   I was looking at the new Dell Ultra Shop 20 inch and I was wondering if I can use it as a TV
[01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:49.280]   and for my computer work and also what TV tuner cars do you guys recommend and which software
[01:06:49.280 --> 01:06:52.280]   to record my TV on my computer.
[01:06:52.280 --> 01:06:54.280]   I hope you guys are going to help me out.
[01:06:54.280 --> 01:06:56.280]   Keep on the good work and I love the show.
[01:06:56.280 --> 01:06:59.280]   >> Now, this guy is calling from Cura Show, the Netherlands, and Tilly's.
[01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:00.280]   >> Which is in the Caribbean.
[01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:03.280]   >> And his handle is ghetto cash.
[01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:06.280]   I don't know if there's anything to be said about that.
[01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:12.280]   What should we -- you can use it as a TV and a monitor if it has the appropriate inputs.
[01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:13.280]   >> Yep.
[01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:18.280]   Now, you may be unhappy with it as a computer monitor if it doesn't have the resolution.
[01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:20.280]   It may be only 1024 by 768.
[01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:21.280]   >> Did he say the Dell?
[01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:22.280]   Is that what he --
[01:07:22.280 --> 01:07:23.280]   >> He said the Dell.
[01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:24.280]   >> Yeah, I love Dell's LCD.
[01:07:24.280 --> 01:07:27.280]   >> But he should do a dedicated MIth TV.
[01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:29.280]   That's what he should do.
[01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:32.280]   >> Kevin did MIth TV on a system.
[01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:33.280]   He used to like MIth.
[01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:34.280]   >> Yeah, I love MIth.
[01:07:34.280 --> 01:07:35.280]   It's great.
[01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:38.280]   >> Patrick, I mean, John, you use MIth TV.
[01:07:38.280 --> 01:07:39.280]   >> I'm building one.
[01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:40.280]   But I've used it.
[01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:41.280]   Yes.
[01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:42.280]   >> What have I done?
[01:07:42.280 --> 01:07:47.280]   I would never have thought that would happen.
[01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:49.280]   >> Beyond TV 3 from Snapstream.
[01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:51.280]   >> Snapstream is pretty good too.
[01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:52.280]   >> Yeah, it's so easy.
[01:07:52.280 --> 01:07:54.280]   >> MIth's free though, right?
[01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:55.280]   >> Completely free open source.
[01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:57.280]   >> How do they get the program listings?
[01:07:57.280 --> 01:08:00.280]   >> They actually have a partnership now where they pull it down.
[01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:02.280]   You just put in your zip code.
[01:08:02.280 --> 01:08:03.280]   >> Yes.
[01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:05.280]   >> And it automatically pulls it all down for you.
[01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:06.280]   >> Okay.
[01:08:06.280 --> 01:08:10.280]   We got one of the rules, by the way, of the Twitcast is we have to keep it under 70 minutes
[01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:12.280]   so people can burn it to a CD.
[01:08:12.280 --> 01:08:16.280]   As far as I know, the only hard limit to the length of the show.
[01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:19.280]   Many people do, in fact, burn it to a CD and listen to it in their car.
[01:08:19.280 --> 01:08:20.280]   >> We're at 73 minutes right now.
[01:08:20.280 --> 01:08:21.280]   >> I know.
[01:08:21.280 --> 01:08:22.280]   That's why I'm saying this, Robert.
[01:08:22.280 --> 01:08:26.280]   I'm going to have to stop this wonderful, wonderful time.
[01:08:26.280 --> 01:08:27.280]   >> I need to get run into.
[01:08:27.280 --> 01:08:28.280]   >> Yeah.
[01:08:28.280 --> 01:08:29.280]   Hey, it's been great talking to you, Robert.
[01:08:29.280 --> 01:08:30.280]   Thank you very much.
[01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:31.280]   >> Thank you.
[01:08:31.280 --> 01:08:33.280]   >> John C. Devorek, always a pleasure.
[01:08:33.280 --> 01:08:34.280]   >> Audio-ish.
[01:08:34.280 --> 01:08:37.280]   >> It's always an audio adventure with John.
[01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:38.280]   >> And every week is different.
[01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:40.280]   >> Every week is something else.
[01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:43.280]   Steve Gibson, now Steve, you're the only one who's going to be left out in the cold when
[01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:51.280]   we move to live broadcasts, but if I can entice you up with some old dipsy barley wine, I will.
[01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:55.280]   >> Yeah, that's -- I'm more of a connoisseur the way John is.
[01:08:55.280 --> 01:08:56.280]   I'm a Cabernet guy.
[01:08:56.280 --> 01:08:58.280]   >> Oh, well, we'll get you some Cabernet, both of you.
[01:08:58.280 --> 01:09:00.280]   I hope we can't get you up from time to time.
[01:09:00.280 --> 01:09:01.280]   >> I think that'd be really fun.
[01:09:01.280 --> 01:09:02.280]   >> I think that'd be really fun.
[01:09:02.280 --> 01:09:03.280]   >> It's going to be a lot of fun.
[01:09:03.280 --> 01:09:05.280]   Roger Chang, always the best.
[01:09:05.280 --> 01:09:13.280]   GameSpot.com, John C. Devorek, I should mention John C. Devorek's blog, Devorek.org, dv-o-r-a-k.
[01:09:13.280 --> 01:09:14.280]   .org.
[01:09:14.280 --> 01:09:16.280]   You don't have to use a Devorek keyboard to get in there.
[01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:19.280]   Kevin Rose is going to fly to Toronto with me.
[01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:20.280]   >> Yes.
[01:09:20.280 --> 01:09:21.280]   >> Great to meet you up on Thursday.
[01:09:21.280 --> 01:09:25.280]   Please come see us at the No Regrets Bar in Lounge, which is in Libertyville.
[01:09:25.280 --> 01:09:27.280]   >> You have links to all that information.
[01:09:27.280 --> 01:09:29.280]   >> I'll be with you all day Wednesday, Leo.
[01:09:29.280 --> 01:09:32.280]   >> And, yeah, I wish you would stick around, Steve, and you can come to the meetup.
[01:09:32.280 --> 01:09:33.280]   >> Yeah, I didn't realize that was happening.
[01:09:33.280 --> 01:09:35.280]   >> Yeah, I'm sorry about that.
[01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:37.280]   I came together at the last minute.
[01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:39.280]   Well, maybe you could change your flight.
[01:09:39.280 --> 01:09:40.280]   It'd be fun to have you.
[01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:43.280]   Anyway, I know a lot of people would like to see you.
[01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:45.280]   Patrick is not going to fly up.
[01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:46.280]   He has a job.
[01:09:46.280 --> 01:09:47.280]   >> You have a day job now.
[01:09:47.280 --> 01:09:49.280]   It cuts into things.
[01:09:49.280 --> 01:09:51.280]   >> You're tied down.
[01:09:51.280 --> 01:09:52.280]   >> Thanks to you all.
[01:09:52.280 --> 01:09:54.280]   I apologize in advance for the audio quality.
[01:09:54.280 --> 01:09:57.280]   One of the reasons we're going to do this live is because we don't have these issues.
[01:09:57.280 --> 01:10:00.280]   I hope it's been worth listening through the mud.
[01:10:00.280 --> 01:10:05.280]   On behalf of all the Twits, go to the website thisweekintech.com.
[01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:06.280]   Contribute, contribute.

[01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:12.280]   Thanks to our good friends at AOL Radio.
[01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:18.280]   For providing the bandwidth for this, they've really stepped up to the plate and made this possible.
[01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:21.280]   Otherwise, I don't know how you'd be getting this show.
[01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:22.280]   What is it?
[01:10:22.280 --> 01:10:23.280]   Is it AOLMusic.com?
[01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:25.280]   Is that the, I think that's the URL.
[01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:27.280]   Anybody else have to thought?
[01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:32.280]   Just we'll see you at Newtons.
[01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:38.280]   Keep that date open September 18th and from then on four o'clock on Sundays.
[01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:46.280]   We'll be doing it live.
[01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:53.280]   Another Twit is in the cab.
[01:10:53.280 --> 01:10:56.280]   That's it for this edition of This Week in Tech.
