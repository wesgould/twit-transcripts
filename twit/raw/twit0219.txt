[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   This is Twit. This weekend tech, the show that covers all
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   things, uh, decky and geeky and that kind of thing.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   I'm Leo LaPorte and joining us in studio today for the first
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   time that I've been on. In fact, I've never met her before.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   The lovely, the talented Natalie Del Conte.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   Thank you for having me. It's great to be here.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   You were on when I was in China, I think.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   I was. Yeah, you were in China and I was on lit John de Vorek and
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   Becky. And when I listened to that show, I was in my apartment
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   in New York sitting on the floor and they were drinking wine.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   And so I thought, oh, I should show up.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   With wine. Not empty-handed, so I brought wine and homemade cookies.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   You did. Boy, not empty-handed.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   You got, you covered both sides of the, uh, of the alley here.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   I also brought my mother because I heard Patrick had his son on
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   last week and I went the other way, generationally.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   You don't have any kids, but I went up the generation ladder.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   Jason Callicannis is also here from, uh, the beautiful Brentwood.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   Ah, yes. And the Callic compound.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   Fresh Prince of Brentwood.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   Jason explained to me every time I have a lovely young lady in here,
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   they bring their mother. Is there something I should be worried about?
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Um, I think that's, it's just chaperone.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   You're a married man. I know. I'm harmless.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   My lawyer told me it was a good thing with you.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   That's it. I knew it. I'll try to fix up their moms with you.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   No, maybe that's it. That could be it.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   That could well be it.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   It's good to talk to you. I haven't talked to you in ages.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   Yeah. I've been, uh, you know, I'm getting busy.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   I got this, uh, big product release coming December 10th.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   A mahalo release or something different?
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   Uh, no, we're having a baby. Oh, London.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   Yes. London will be here.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   It's exciting December 10th.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   Right around the corner. Oh, that's fantastic.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   I am, uh, like so excited. I can't, I'm, I'm like more excited than ever.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   And also terrified at the same time.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   It's a really interesting, uh, feeling for me.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   I'm not usually terrified of anything.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   Oh, you should be terrified of this. This is nothing.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   I mean, uh, entrepreneurial ship is nothing.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   Watching birthing a company is nothing compared to birthing a baby.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   Yeah. So we're, we're excited.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   You won't even, you won't even do it.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Really any of the work. You just be sitting there.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   I, I tell you, this whole pregnancy thing, uh, so far, so good.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   I feel great.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   We're eight months in and I'm feeling great to find, to find a way to add value
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   when you're just kind of watching the whole.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   It is hard. It's a little, it's, you feel bad a little bit.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   Like all the sufferings going on on the other side.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   But don't worry, Jason, the nausea begins in the first trimester
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   after birth for the, for the father.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   Just, just thought you'd like to know something with a photo.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   A lack of sleep is instantaneous.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   Oh, that's right here.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   Oh, anyway, that's great. That's soon. That's like a month.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   I am giving my last keynote. I'm going to retire from keynoteing.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   I'm going to do my last keynote next week and that's it.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   No more travel. Nothing.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   Oh, well, congratulations.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   Yep.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   You can still do Twit though, because that's the kind of thing you could do with the baby.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   Of course.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   We found that out last week.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   Oh, did you have a crying baby on the show?
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   Norton, Rod Seamus is two year old.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   Oh, that's awesome.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   Oh, Lordy, Lordy.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   That was something, he actually left about a third of the way through.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   In fact, we may, he may show up again because he said,
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   can I, can I come back next week? And I said, yes, but he hasn't, he hasn't come back.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   So he may, he may walk in the door at any minute.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   Give a real revolving door here.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   It's an open door.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   That's a good way to put it.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   It was literally open, wasn't it?
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   It was open.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   Just walked right in.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   Yeah, anyone can come off the same.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   Yeah, really shouldn't do that, should I?
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   Once they know there's cookies.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   Hey, there's something else here, Jason, that I'm very intrigued in.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   Natalie brought the Motorola shows, the New Verizon Droid.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   Yes, I did.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   I am hearing great things about this product.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   It's a really fun phone and Google announced this week now that it's doing SatNav on Google
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   Maps, but only with Android 2.0, which this is the only phone now running Android 2.0.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   So I used the SatNav to get here because I came from San Francisco.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   I was filming loaded at CNET and I put in the address here and it worked great.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   It feels really nice.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   If you compare it to the iPhone, it's about the same size.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   Screen is maybe a little taller, slightly wider, higher res.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   Right, it feels heavier to me than the iPhone.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   It is a little heavier, isn't it?
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   Yeah, it's not much thicker.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   It's not much thicker.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   It's five megapixels.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   And it's got a faster product.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   So there's a lot of guts in there that it's going to maybe feel a bit heavier.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   I wish the edges were rounded because I don't think it says comfortable in your hand.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   But other than that, I think it's really, really great.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   It's got a real keyboard.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   Now this is a tiny keyboard.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   Do you have small fingers?
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   So this might be okay for you, but I think I'd have trouble typing like this.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   Well, that's the problem with small hands is when I hold it in one in each hand, my little tiny thumbs
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   don't reach to the center of the keyboard.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   So I have to keep curling my hands in.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   But the virtual keyboard works great.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   So most of the time I don't opt for the physical keyboard.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   And it's got the new Android 2.0 operating system on it.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   And have you, did you use the G1 phone?
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   Can you compare it to the G1?
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   A little bit.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   I didn't use the G1 extensively, but I do find it to be, it, you know, it gets to the
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   Android marketplace.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   It sinks well with exchange.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   It's again fast.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   It feels very snappy.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   Much snappy.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   And the G1 did.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   I really like it.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   I'm a fan of it.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   I like that the camera also has a flash.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   There's 16 gigs of onboard memory.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   I listened to last week's Twit over Google Listen.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   Oh yeah.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   Google Listen has a nice podcast application.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   Really nice.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   It works on the same way.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   I've never heard of this.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   What is Google Listen?
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   Is it an Android application?
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   Yeah, it's in the Android marketplace.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   Oh.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   And is it made by Google?
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   It is.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   It's a Google product that takes RSS feeds of podcasts and you can listen to them and it'll
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   cache it locally so that I can walk outside.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   I need a block or two of Leeway.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   But if I start listening to a podcast and then get on the subway, it will continue.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   So it's downloading it as you've, as you start streaming it.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   Oh my God.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   That's genius.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.760]   I've been waiting for that application.
[00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:05.760]   It's great.
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:06.760]   It's really great.
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:09.360]   It's definitely one of the best podcast applications I've ever seen.
[00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:11.120]   This is the thing that's really interesting.
[00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:12.560]   I just had an epiphany.
[00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:16.800]   The everybody talks about iPhones lead in the application business.
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:21.320]   If Google is going to make applications for their own phones, they have like thousands
[00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:22.560]   of really great programmers.
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:25.720]   They own the most of the best web app programmers on the planet.
[00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:29.040]   Are they going to just start releasing like a program or two a week?
[00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:30.600]   They certainly could, couldn't they?
[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:31.600]   They could.
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:32.960]   They could make everything that is great on.
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:35.880]   They could make their own version of everything that's great on the iPhone.
[00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:41.720]   Today or this week, Apple announced that there are over 100,000 apps, 102,000 apps that they
[00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:45.680]   had approved and about 97,000 of them were in the store.
[00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:47.320]   97,000 applications.
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:48.320]   That's extraordinary.
[00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:52.480]   It just shows that developers are happy with the business model that some people complained
[00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:55.120]   about, you know, the 70%, 30%.
[00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:57.400]   I spent the percent that 100% is zero.
[00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:58.400]   Yeah.
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:03.000]   I've seen a demographic breakdown of developers and a lot of people think that the developers
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.320]   that are writing applications are a lot of 14 year old kids or people who are not really
[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:10.440]   because that's why there's so many of them is.
[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:11.440]   Yeah, a lot of flashlights.
[00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:12.440]   There's a lot of crap in that.
[00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:13.440]   I don't think that's bad.
[00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:17.720]   I think that means that first of all, that 14 year old who's writing an application today
[00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:21.040]   in five years is going to be writing really good applications.
[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:22.440]   So it's not a bad thing.
[00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:26.280]   Remember Apple used to put Apple twos in every school because they wanted to get to cultivate
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:28.080]   those kids.
[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:31.200]   It also means that it's easy to write.
[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:33.840]   If it were hard to write, you wouldn't get a 14 year old writing applications.
[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:34.840]   Right.
[00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:36.480]   So I don't think that's necessarily a negative.
[00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:37.480]   I mean, you know.
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:38.480]   Right.
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:41.880]   I think that the point I'm trying to make is that we don't know that the younger developers
[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:44.880]   are really okay with the revenue model.
[00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:50.400]   They might just be okay with doing it for practice in sort of an open community forum.
[00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:53.720]   Well, you know, I've seen developers talk, in fact, this scoble has an article on his
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:54.720]   blog.
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:59.400]   It lasts a couple of days saying developers when faced with all the different platforms
[00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:04.320]   to develop and they've got to make that choice pretty much always come down to Android and
[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:05.320]   iPhone.
[00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:06.320]   That makes sense.
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:09.240]   But what's significantly missing is Blackberry.
[00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:11.080]   That's not good for Blackberry.
[00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:14.000]   And Blackberry is a leader in smartphone penetration right now.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.880]   So it's kind of odd.
[00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:18.440]   I just got to have Appworld, which they just released.
[00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:21.880]   And so I've been playing with the Appworld, but you go in there and it's like going into
[00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:23.800]   Walmart if like half the shelves were empty.
[00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:25.640]   It's like, there should be more things in here.
[00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:29.600]   You pull up like, you pull up certain categories and you're like, really, there's nothing here.
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:30.600]   Where is everything?
[00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:31.600]   Where'd everybody go?
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:32.600]   Yeah.
[00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:33.600]   Kind of sad.
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:34.600]   Agreed.
[00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:38.600]   But damn, people are going to be able to launch these applications instantly.
[00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:42.920]   So this whole idea on Android, you just point to a URL and you can download an application.
[00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:44.400]   You don't even go through Google.
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:45.400]   Right.
[00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:46.400]   You just go direct.
[00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:50.160]   I mean, it's interesting that Google is doing turn by turn navigation.
[00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:51.800]   They say they're going to try to get it in the Apple store.
[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:53.200]   There's no way Apple will let them do that.
[00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:57.960]   Because Apple's even says in the terms of service, no turn by turn navigation.
[00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:00.680]   Well, obviously without our approval because Tom Tom's doing it.
[00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:01.680]   Right.
[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:03.440]   And they charge an arm and a leg for it.
[00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:04.560]   I can't see Apple saying yes.
[00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:08.400]   But on the other hand, with all the attention they're getting from the FCC right now, maybe
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:09.400]   they can't say no.
[00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:11.720]   Maybe they just have that option.
[00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:13.200]   So you said it worked pretty well.
[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:17.080]   Do you think it replaces your Tom Tom or your Garmin?
[00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:20.560]   Well, I'm probably the wrong person to ask about this because I don't drive.
[00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:21.840]   I live in New York City.
[00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:25.320]   So I don't need turn by turn navigation all that often.
[00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:29.960]   But in the off chance that I do get a zip car and need it, then this is much, much better.
[00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:30.960]   That's all you need.
[00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:32.120]   It is all you need.
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:33.840]   I don't have a separation.
[00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:34.840]   Why get more?
[00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:39.920]   But I don't think it didn't lead me wrong here except when I pulled off to go to Jack
[00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:41.600]   in the box on my way up here.
[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:42.600]   And it did tell me to go the wrong way.
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.480]   Wanda, you let Natalie go to Jack in the box?
[00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:45.960]   She made me go to Jack in the box.
[00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:46.960]   It was her idea.
[00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:47.960]   Mom says Jack.
[00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:48.960]   That's very cute.
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:53.960]   In and out next time though.
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:54.960]   I know.
[00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:56.440]   Well, yeah, we did go to last night.
[00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:57.440]   You went to the net?
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:58.440]   After our Halloween.
[00:10:58.440 --> 00:10:59.680]   Oh, yeah.
[00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:03.960]   That's nothing like about 80 mounds bars and then in and out burger to really settle
[00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:04.960]   the stomach.
[00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:08.880]   Well, I made the cookies before we went out last night for Halloween.
[00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:09.880]   So I was...
[00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:10.880]   Did you have a costume?
[00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:11.880]   I did.
[00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:12.880]   I was a top chef.
[00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:13.880]   Oh, cute.
[00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:14.880]   Yeah.
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:15.880]   I saw your costume on Facebook.
[00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:16.880]   You were really nervous.
[00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:17.880]   Yeah, it's good.
[00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:18.880]   That's probably what I was.
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:19.880]   You didn't know?
[00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:20.880]   No, people asked me.
[00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:21.880]   I said, "I'm Rocky Rococo."
[00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:22.880]   I didn't know.
[00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:23.880]   You didn't do any more.
[00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:24.880]   I was a rolling darish.
[00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:25.880]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:26.880]   Yeah, I could have a shoulda.
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:28.880]   I could have spun around like crazy.
[00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:29.880]   What did you...
[00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:30.880]   You don't trick or treat Jason.
[00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:33.480]   Do you bring tourists and fondue out your old dogs?
[00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:36.680]   There is a thing called Bow Wow Wien here in Brechtwood.
[00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:37.680]   And it's...
[00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:40.240]   You, Ted Danson, Jill Klayberg, the gang.
[00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:44.320]   It's basically everybody gets together, me and Ted.
[00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:48.440]   And they dress up their dogs.
[00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:49.440]   I just...
[00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:50.440]   This is...
[00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:52.400]   I just want to say this is where the rest of the world hates us.
[00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:53.400]   I just want to point out.
[00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:54.400]   And that's why the dogs hate us.
[00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:55.400]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:56.400]   And the dogs.
[00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:57.400]   Not just the rest of the world, the dogs.
[00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:00.400]   I mean, other places in the world are eating dogs because they're actually...
[00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:05.680]   Actually, I had Ozzy, our little Papillon dog in a sombrero and a syrupe.
[00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:06.680]   It was...
[00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:07.680]   Thank you.
[00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:08.680]   Thank you.
[00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:11.280]   I think it's meant for a chihuahua, but he's the same size, so...
[00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:12.560]   How multicultural of you?
[00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:13.560]   Yes.
[00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:14.560]   I thought that was very diverse.
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:15.560]   It's a very diverse person.
[00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:16.560]   I was in the face.
[00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:17.560]   And next to the dog.
[00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:19.440]   Is it from down under?
[00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:20.440]   No.
[00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:27.240]   How much for dangerous is it to use a mobile phone for turn-by-turn navigation than an in-unit
[00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:29.000]   designed for when you're driving kind of unit?
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.320]   I mean, this seems like a recipe for disaster.
[00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:32.800]   It's a recipe anyway.
[00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:33.800]   Come on, Jason.
[00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:35.760]   When you use your GPS, you look over at it.
[00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:36.760]   You touch it.
[00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:37.760]   You press the button.
[00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:42.840]   Well, actually, in the cars I have, a number of the units don't allow you to touch it unless
[00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:45.560]   you're going under five miles an hour or something.
[00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:50.160]   It's one of the reasons to get an external unit like a dash, which has now been sold to
[00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:54.200]   Blackberry, but that's the reason I use the dash is because when I'm on the highway, if
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:55.920]   I'm stuck in traffic, I can touch it.
[00:12:55.920 --> 00:13:00.520]   But holding it in your hand, I don't have to hold the GPS unit in my hand to do the commands.
[00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:01.520]   It's mounted.
[00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:02.520]   Right.
[00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:03.520]   I mean, sort of this unmounted thing.
[00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:05.600]   I see cab drivers doing this now, and it makes me really nervous.
[00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:06.600]   Oh, that's bad.
[00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:07.600]   Also, the screen size is what?
[00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:08.600]   Half the size?
[00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:09.600]   A third of the size?
[00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:10.600]   It should really be.
[00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:11.600]   You should have a little holder for it.
[00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:15.160]   I thought I saw that there were already third parties making holders for this that were
[00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:16.160]   all mounting your car.
[00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:21.040]   But also, when you think of the traditional Sat Nav devices, they're made by a company
[00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:22.680]   that doesn't make phones.
[00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:26.760]   And so they make some kind of nonsensical decisions, like a keyboard that's not quirky,
[00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:29.960]   but instead alphabetical, or it's not an interface that you get used to.
[00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:33.000]   So if it's your phone, you have your hands on this all day.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.040]   You have a lot of muscle memory when it comes to using that phone.
[00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:39.920]   So if you do need to touch it a little bit while you're driving, at least your body's
[00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:42.360]   already ready for that.
[00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:47.320]   Where do you stand on-- is it actually a very interesting question?
[00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:48.320]   Where do you stand on?
[00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:50.800]   Because you use a lot of portable devices.
[00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:54.880]   The idea that everything should be in one device, or is it better to have a music player
[00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:56.720]   and a GPS and a phone?
[00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:58.200]   You want it all in one device?
[00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:04.280]   Well, that's the thing, is that I'm-- if I decide to make this my primary phone, then
[00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:09.840]   that takes me off of iTunes, which is where I tend to keep and store my music.
[00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:13.520]   So then will I go to an iPod Touch or an iPod Classic?
[00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:16.000]   And maybe I like that idea, maybe I don't.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.640]   I know Donald Bell, who reviews MP3 players that's seen it, says he really likes the idea
[00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:25.480]   of having a standalone MP3 player.
[00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:26.480]   Like best in class.
[00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:28.240]   Like it's the best MP3 player could be.
[00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:29.960]   It's the best navigation it could be.
[00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:31.800]   It's the best phone it could be, instead of compromising.
[00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:32.800]   Right.
[00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:34.160]   So I don't know.
[00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:36.920]   I think it really depends device by device.
[00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:41.840]   I don't love reading books on my phone, even though the Kindle has an iPhone application.
[00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:44.320]   I like to have a standalone device as an e-reader.
[00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:47.040]   So I think it really is going to depend on the function.
[00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:48.040]   How about you, Jason?
[00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:50.440]   You got an opinion on that?
[00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:53.320]   I always carry my BlackBerry and my iPhone with me.
[00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:54.320]   Oh, interesting.
[00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:55.320]   You have two phones.
[00:14:55.320 --> 00:15:00.400]   I will never be with one phone, because it's too-- I mean, I need to get on email.
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:01.400]   Sometimes it's an emergency.
[00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:03.920]   Sometimes I'm the only person who can answer a question.
[00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:05.920]   Sometimes I got to check the next score, whatever.
[00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:06.920]   You know, it's important things going on.
[00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:07.920]   You're done in C.
[00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:14.920]   Hey, by the way, what did you and Mark Cuban say at the Dallas game at the Man's Lakers?
[00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:17.920]   Were you sitting next to each other, Connor?
[00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:23.080]   No, somebody who I know had second row seats, so he got me second row seats and then Mark
[00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:24.080]   was right across.
[00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:27.360]   So he saw me and came over and we just chatted it up for a little bit.
[00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:30.400]   I'd love to be a fly on the wall for that one.
[00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:35.000]   You know, when he's at a game, number one, I don't-- like one time I went to a game with
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   him.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.280]   He got me tickets for the All-Star game a couple of years back and we hung out in the
[00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:42.040]   suite with Dirk and Nwitski and everything.
[00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:45.880]   It was cool because he's not in the game, but when it's a game that he's playing in,
[00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:49.400]   you do not-- I don't want to sit next to him because he gets in a foul mood if they're
[00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:54.520]   losing and he gets insane and he's arguing with people like five rows in front of behind
[00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:55.520]   him.
[00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:56.920]   He's arguing with the refs.
[00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:57.920]   He's throwing chairs.
[00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:01.000]   I mean, he did get fun for running on the court.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.480]   I mean, the guy is really passionate about it.
[00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:04.160]   So that's like him working.
[00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:07.920]   So you know, like if people who don't know him are like, hey, we should go to a game
[00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:09.400]   together.
[00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:12.080]   And I never ask him like, hey, go to a game together because I know how he is.
[00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:13.080]   It's work.
[00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:16.240]   That's like asking somebody who's a conductor like, hey, can I go hang out with you when
[00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:17.240]   you're conducting an orchestra?
[00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:20.600]   It's like, no, it's-- he's actually really into it.
[00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:21.600]   So--
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:26.120]   And also his reputation as for being fairly bombastic in that way.
[00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:27.120]   Yeah.
[00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:30.160]   But I mean, he was like the mayor of the Staples Center.
[00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:34.200]   I mean, everybody is coming up to say hello to him and people are yelling his name.
[00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:39.960]   I mean, he really has done an amazing thing for the NBA in terms of getting excitement.
[00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:45.040]   When he comes to his arena sold out, number one, he's in the top three or four arenas
[00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:47.000]   in terms of being sold out.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.840]   And when he goes to an arena, when Dallas goes to an arena, I mean, those games sell
[00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:51.240]   out because people want to see him.
[00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:52.240]   They want to see the Mavericks.
[00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:53.320]   He creates a sense of excitement.
[00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:54.320]   So good for him.
[00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:55.320]   Yeah.
[00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:56.320]   Another one of that.
[00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:57.320]   Yeah.
[00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:58.320]   But I think-- I like the idea of having redundant.
[00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:02.960]   So when I was at that game, I was taking pictures of like-- or videos of Posh Spice who was there
[00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:06.320]   with Bex and Kelsey Grammer and all this stuff.
[00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:08.440]   But I was like, I'm going to take a video with my iPhone.
[00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:12.240]   I'm going to take a picture of my Blackberry and one's uploading so I can use the other
[00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:14.280]   one.
[00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:16.160]   I think people are going to have multiple devices.
[00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:18.760]   But devices will share functionality.
[00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:22.560]   So your Kindle will let you do email and surf the web eventually.
[00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:25.360]   And you'll be able to have eBooks from your Kindle on your iPhone.
[00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:27.520]   But you're going to use whichever one's best.
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:29.560]   And people will have multiple ones because the cost of these things is also going to
[00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:31.000]   go down by going to--
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.320]   I'd love to get that Kindle into something because you know, you don't want to carry that
[00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:36.320]   Kindle around all the time.
[00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:38.720]   Boy, this is a category that's exploding.
[00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:42.640]   Not only Barnes and Noble, I just saw-- who else has just announced an e-book reader or
[00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:44.120]   they're going to do an e-book reader?
[00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:45.120]   A Seuss tech.
[00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:47.840]   That creative labs or something.
[00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:48.840]   Yeah.
[00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:49.840]   I mean, it's crazy.
[00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:50.840]   Right.
[00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:51.840]   I don't think that many people read books.
[00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:52.840]   Yeah.
[00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:53.840]   I mean, who's buying these things?
[00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:57.280]   I mean, put a TV show on there and maybe somebody will buy it.
[00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:02.840]   I don't understand why they just have this like a version to letting you do email or
[00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:04.760]   surf the web on it.
[00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:06.440]   I mean, it's clearly capable of that.
[00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:07.920]   So why would you punish people?
[00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:10.400]   Oh, I don't think it's really that capable of that.
[00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:11.840]   The Kindle is a slow device.
[00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:12.840]   It takes-- I mean, even though they say--
[00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:14.400]   Well, that screen is really slow.
[00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:15.400]   The screen is really--
[00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:16.400]   Yeah, the screen is slow.
[00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:18.440]   It doesn't change pages all that quickly.
[00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:21.040]   So I wouldn't want to do too much web surf.
[00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:22.040]   I mean, if you go to the web--
[00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:23.640]   One person in the chat room said I read books.
[00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:24.640]   One person.
[00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:25.640]   Yeah.
[00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:26.640]   I read books.
[00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:27.640]   He buys books.
[00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:28.640]   I buy them.
[00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:29.640]   They're on my shelf.
[00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:30.640]   I don't read them.
[00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:33.720]   No, but what about if you wanted to get the weather or text-based stuff?
[00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:38.920]   I'm not saying you're going to be using Flash and playing Farmville on your Kindle, but
[00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:41.720]   what if it showed you the next--
[00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:43.720]   I played Farmville on my Kindle.
[00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:46.720]   I think God, they don't have Farmville on my Kindle.
[00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:47.720]   Oh, forget about that.
[00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:50.720]   I mean, people would be playing Farmville and imagine they put Farmville on the GPS.
[00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:53.000]   Did you get sucked into that Farmville thing?
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.600]   I played it for-- I said, I have to check this out because it's all over my Facebook
[00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:57.600]   newsfeed.
[00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:01.560]   I turned it on and then I looked up and I think it went from being Monday to Wednesday.
[00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:02.560]   Yeah.
[00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:04.600]   Like, whatever they're doing, I think they're hypnotizing people in that game.
[00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:05.600]   It's the most addictive crack.
[00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:06.600]   Do you ever play that down?
[00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:07.600]   Do you ever play that down?
[00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:08.600]   Each of them?
[00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:10.320]   No, I ignore all the invitations on Facebook.
[00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:11.720]   Something about-- it's the zing of stuff.
[00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:15.640]   These guys-- these guys-- they're-- what is it?
[00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:16.640]   They're crushing it.
[00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:17.640]   They're crushing it.
[00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:18.640]   Yeah, they have crushed it.
[00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:19.640]   Yes, they're crushing it.
[00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:21.840]   150 million a year.
[00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:22.840]   It's nuts.
[00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:25.560]   I mean, I remember when Mark Pink is some pretty good friends with him and we were at
[00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:28.320]   dinner and he's like, I think I'm buying this poker company and what do you think?
[00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:30.320]   And I was like, I don't know.
[00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:32.600]   It sounds like casual games that's been done.
[00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:33.600]   No, no, no.
[00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:34.600]   Absolutely wrong.
[00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:35.600]   Absolutely wrong.
[00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:36.800]   It's so fast on that.
[00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:41.840]   And I begged Sequoia Capital to invest in that company when I was working there.
[00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:47.200]   It was a consultant and Fred Wilson wound up doing it who had invested in Mark's first
[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:48.200]   company.
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:52.960]   But they have figured out what's addictive about the social games and what's unique about
[00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:53.960]   being able to say--
[00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:54.960]   That's their success, isn't it?
[00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:56.360]   You invite your friends to this.
[00:19:56.360 --> 00:20:01.640]   And now I'm going to-- if I invite you, then I get extra points and gold to plant better
[00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:02.640]   trees.
[00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:04.200]   And they've really nailed that piece of attention.
[00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:05.600]   So it's a picture of your virtual currency.
[00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:08.160]   Does Pinkis have some expert in that working on this?
[00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:14.120]   I mean, I would think that this must be a specialty is a game addiction specialist.
[00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:16.000]   Like a person who could turn that stuff on.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:21.840]   Yeah, I mean, in truth and there's no dig to Zynga, all of this had been done already
[00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:25.320]   in other games just like Age of Empires you had.
[00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:27.080]   But putting it on Facebook was what it did.
[00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:29.560]   Yeah, so what they basically did was they figured out a way to sort of strip the games
[00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:31.720]   down into something simpler.
[00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:33.640]   And this is from middle America.
[00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:38.200]   I mean, this is like moms and students and playing this grandma's and it's super addictive
[00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:39.560]   and social.
[00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:41.160]   And what do we like about playing games?
[00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:42.160]   It's playing games with other people.
[00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:43.920]   This is what the Nintendo we did.
[00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:45.280]   It's not the technology.
[00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:49.440]   It's the socialization of the technology that really makes it explode.
[00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:51.240]   But the virtual currency is amazing.
[00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:55.240]   I mean, that really people are more motivated by virtual currency than real currency.
[00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:57.800]   You know, I was reading The Wealth of Networks by...
[00:20:57.800 --> 00:20:58.800]   Great book.
[00:20:58.800 --> 00:20:59.800]   Yeah.
[00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:03.640]   And he says something in there that I've been thinking about lately about how it used to
[00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:08.160]   be before the digital revolution that from nine to five we had some kind of hierarchical
[00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:09.680]   relationship with production.
[00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:11.160]   So you produce something, you bought something.
[00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:12.160]   It was called a job.
[00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:13.160]   Right.
[00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:16.240]   And then come quitting time, you were then a consumer.
[00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:17.240]   Right.
[00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:18.240]   And so it was duplicitous.
[00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:19.480]   You were either that or you're this.
[00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:24.840]   And now the digital world is blurring our reality so much that you are both a consumer
[00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:26.600]   and a producer at the same time.
[00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:30.080]   And I think this Farmville really speaks to that is that you don't have to be one or
[00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:31.080]   the other.
[00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:33.440]   You are both, again, producer, consumer.
[00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:35.840]   And that's what we call the user.
[00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:36.840]   Yeah.
[00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:43.200]   It's a really interesting change in the way that we interact with anything.
[00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:46.480]   I cut you off his last name is Benkler, B-E-N-K-L-E-R.
[00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:49.280]   And the book is online, The Wealth of Networks.
[00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:50.280]   That's a great book.
[00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:51.280]   Really interesting.
[00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:52.280]   It's fascinating.
[00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:57.280]   Let me take a break and speaking of books and we're going to talk a little bit about
[00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:59.040]   Audible and we will come back.
[00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:01.520]   Natalie Del Conte is here.
[00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:08.200]   She is the star of what you're the star of.
[00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:09.560]   Are you on a regular show on CNET?
[00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:10.560]   I am.
[00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:12.200]   You're on Buzz Out Loud pretty regularly.
[00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:13.200]   Yes.
[00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:14.200]   So I do Buzz Out Loud two days a week.
[00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:15.200]   Two days a week.
[00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:19.000]   And then I have a regular show called Loaded, which is just your daily tech wrap up of what's
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   going on.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.920]   It's five minutes every morning.
[00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:28.640]   And I also do tech reporting for the CBS Early Show and CBS News Local Affiliates.
[00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:29.640]   Cool.
[00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:35.520]   And of course, Jason Calicanis, basketball wizard and entrepreneur whose twist show is
[00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:37.920]   huge.
[00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:38.920]   Thank you.
[00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:40.480]   Thank you for the inspiration.
[00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:44.040]   And I've learned a lot about doing the show from you.
[00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:45.040]   You got a...
[00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:48.000]   Last time I talked, you had our web page this weekend, right?
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   Is that moving along?
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   What's the deal with it?
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   I just...
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:55.840]   I bought the domain name this weekend and my idea for it and I sort of ran up the flag
[00:22:55.840 --> 00:23:00.040]   poll with you and I bought it was just make a landing page where we can put all of these
[00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:02.040]   great this weekend shows.
[00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:04.640]   You know, this week in Google has been a great addition.
[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:05.880]   And then there's people outside.
[00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:11.520]   So maybe we can, you know, centralize some of the stuff and, you know, sell advertising
[00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:12.520]   into it.
[00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:13.520]   Cool.
[00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:14.520]   Yeah.
[00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:15.520]   Sure.
[00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:16.520]   Always like the idea.
[00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:17.980]   But I'm going to mention something that will make you even more.
[00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:18.980]   We're excited right now.
[00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:21.400]   It's called, you know what I'm talking about.
[00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:23.400]   Audible.com, baby.
[00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:24.400]   Audible.
[00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:25.400]   Audible.
[00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:27.600]   It's taking up so much of my time.
[00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:30.120]   I don't know if they're going to ask you to talk about the copper brace.
[00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:31.120]   They are.
[00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:32.120]   Do you...
[00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:33.120]   Are they really?
[00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:34.120]   Yeah.
[00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:35.120]   Yeah.
[00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:36.120]   This is great.
[00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:37.120]   I mean, this is made for the medium content.
[00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:38.440]   I mean, this is not a book made into audiobook.
[00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:46.480]   These are the great thriller writers and they're making content directly for audiobook.
[00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:47.480]   So made for the medium.
[00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:51.980]   I know this is going to be an audiobook and they're writing it to be an audiobook.
[00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:52.980]   Really fantastic.
[00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:53.980]   And it's a...
[00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:54.980]   They did this last year.
[00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:55.980]   It's a follow up to it.
[00:23:55.980 --> 00:23:56.980]   Yeah.
[00:23:56.980 --> 00:23:57.980]   It's a chop in manuscript.
[00:23:57.980 --> 00:23:58.980]   Right?
[00:23:58.980 --> 00:23:59.980]   It's a follow up.
[00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:00.980]   And you can get it now.
[00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:01.980]   I think you can download the first chapter to free.
[00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:02.980]   I don't know if they...
[00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:03.980]   They had the...
[00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:04.980]   I screwed it up last week.
[00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:05.980]   They had the first chapter free last week.
[00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:11.260]   And now you can get the whole book for $9.95 at our special place.
[00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:15.340]   It's Audible.com/TwitCauper.
[00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:17.840]   So this is Jeffrey Deaver.
[00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:19.040]   You know, and people know him.
[00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:21.100]   He's of course a bestseller, thriller author.
[00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:26.400]   He wrote the first chapter, gave it to another writer, Gail Linz, who wrote the second chapter.
[00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:30.120]   She gave it to David Hewson, wrote the third chapter, which must be fun for these guys.
[00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:34.720]   Sixteen, very well-known thriller writers in all.
[00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:37.680]   And then Deaver gets it and writes the last chapter.
[00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:41.220]   You know, Molly Wood and Tom Merritt and I did kind of something like that on Twitter.
[00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:43.280]   We did a 140 character novel.
[00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:45.280]   I think these guys are probably better.
[00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:46.280]   Yeah.
[00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:48.040]   Let's leave it to the professionals.
[00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:49.600]   Alfred Molina does the narration.
[00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:51.320]   He did the Chopin manuscript and he's very good.
[00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:52.880]   He also did DaVinci Code Spider-Man to you.
[00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:54.680]   I think I'll play a little bit if you want to.
[00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:55.680]   Yeah, that's here.
[00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:56.680]   Wait a minute.
[00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:58.280]   Wait a minute.
[00:24:58.280 --> 00:24:59.720]   They don't have the preview on here.
[00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:00.720]   Let me see if I can see how...
[00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:01.720]   Here it is.
[00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:03.920]   Here's a little bit from the Chopin manuscript.
[00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:04.920]   Born in New Delhi.
[00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:09.980]   And now he liked to think a resident of the world was observing the family through expensive
[00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:14.780]   binoculars from a hundred yards away in the hills above the beach.
[00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:20.280]   He was parked in a rented Fiat listening to some syrupy French pop music.
[00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:22.680]   He was taking in the grey water, the grey stuff.
[00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:24.860]   I can't wait to listen to this.
[00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:25.860]   It's good, right?
[00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:26.860]   Yeah.
[00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:28.860]   All of a sudden it's like, what's a syrupy?
[00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:29.860]   Yeah, I need to hear more.
[00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:30.860]   I need to hear more.
[00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:31.860]   Yeah.
[00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:32.860]   It's true.
[00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:33.860]   It's a great thing about audiobooks.
[00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:36.700]   It's just like when you're driving instead of listening to commercials, you can be listening
[00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:39.500]   to these like professional authors like what is really thrilling stuff.
[00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:40.500]   And this has probably been made into a movie.
[00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:44.100]   I just got a new car which I was supposed to talk about this week and I can't talk about
[00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:45.100]   till next week.
[00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:49.500]   But it has an audio system that ties into my iPhone.
[00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:53.740]   And when I get in the car, the book starts and when I leave the car, it stops.
[00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:54.740]   Wow.
[00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:55.740]   And I am in heaven now.
[00:25:55.740 --> 00:25:57.540]   I am just like in heaven.
[00:25:57.540 --> 00:25:58.540]   It is...
[00:25:58.540 --> 00:25:59.540]   It's amazing.
[00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:02.300]   The simple little feature like just knowing where you left off is just so important.
[00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:03.300]   It's so cool.
[00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:04.300]   It's so cool.
[00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:08.820]   I think I know a car that is by the way, because I know the car that has that system.
[00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:09.820]   It's so awesome.
[00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:13.060]   Well, actually we're going to advertise the system next week because I can't talk about
[00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:15.380]   it till then because they're still doing some research on it.
[00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:16.940]   So I will next week.
[00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:18.740]   I was going to do it this week and next week I'll talk about it.
[00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:19.740]   Is it parked outside?
[00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:21.220]   You could see it out the window.
[00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:22.220]   Ooh.
[00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:23.220]   Yeah.
[00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:24.220]   And it's a new Twitmobile.
[00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:26.220]   I'll agree to the embargo.
[00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:27.220]   Yeah.
[00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:28.220]   There is an embargo.
[00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:29.220]   I wish there weren't.
[00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:31.460]   It is the hardest thing I've ever done.
[00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:34.980]   You know, I don't normally accept embargoes or NDAs from other people.
[00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:39.180]   And now I'm embargoing myself and it's like I want to just nail my head with it.
[00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:40.180]   Oh, shoot.
[00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:44.420]   Wait, you don't want to say it because you want to get it perfect when you do it.
[00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:45.620]   I can't talk too much about why.
[00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:47.340]   But the campaign starts next week.
[00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:50.420]   They don't want us to talk about it until the campaign starts because they're doing research
[00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:52.220]   now, et cetera.
[00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:58.500]   Anyway, Jeffrey Deaver, Lisa Skiska-Lini, Joseph Fineer-Leach child and a cast of 16
[00:26:58.500 --> 00:26:59.500]   of the best writers.
[00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:04.620]   Alfred Molina, you don't get a better narrator and it's yours right now for 995@audible.com.
[00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:05.620]   We love Audible.
[00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:06.620]   We know you will.
[00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:07.620]   So give me a try.
[00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:08.620]   Oh, yeah.
[00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:12.460]   And you know, if you're a fan of the show, you already have an Audible subscription.
[00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:14.060]   You're going to pick this up.
[00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:15.940]   What you want to do is to support the show.
[00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:17.500]   And I mean, the show is free.
[00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:18.500]   You don't charge.
[00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:20.660]   You could easily charge like a lot of other people do.
[00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:23.420]   And the show is frankly, you can have twice as many ads in the show.
[00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:24.580]   It's still be just as good.
[00:27:24.580 --> 00:27:28.260]   You're pretty reserved in the amount of ads you put in.
[00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:32.300]   Why not just tweet thanks to Audible.com/twitcopper.
[00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:36.740]   C-O-P-P-E-R-2-P's in that for those people who are dyslexic like me.
[00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:42.300]   You tweet that on behalf of the show and just say thank you to Audible for supporting independent
[00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:43.300]   media.
[00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:44.300]   You know, that means a lot to Audible.
[00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:46.620]   I know because I talk to these guys, they're Audible under COM.
[00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:49.980]   And they love to see that every Sunday when you do your show every Friday when I do my
[00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:52.740]   show, they see Vang's Audible underscore COM.
[00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:54.260]   That's their ad symbol.
[00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:55.980]   And they get like a couple hundred followers.
[00:27:55.980 --> 00:27:56.980]   Follow Audible.
[00:27:56.980 --> 00:27:58.540]   I mean, it means something to them.
[00:27:58.540 --> 00:28:01.300]   And they have been a supporter of this show since the beginning almost, right?
[00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:02.300]   Yeah.
[00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:04.580]   I think this is their third year now.
[00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:06.260]   So we're grateful to them.
[00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:08.180]   We're grateful to you for listening to the show.
[00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:09.180]   Let's see.
[00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:10.380]   We've been talking about Android.
[00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:16.980]   There's so much news about this Android 3 2.0 and the new Droid phone.
[00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:22.820]   The ARIS, which is the next one we now know is going to come out in October 6th, right?
[00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:24.380]   So it's like a week away.
[00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:25.380]   But that's...
[00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:26.460]   The Droid comes out November 6th.
[00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:30.500]   The Droid is November 6th and the ARIS is another month after that.
[00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:32.500]   It's unfortunately it's 1.6.
[00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:33.500]   It's not 2.0.
[00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:35.780]   I don't know why they are putting the old Android in there.
[00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:37.620]   And it's got a smaller processor.
[00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:38.620]   I'm disappointed.
[00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:39.620]   So it's kind of...
[00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:40.620]   But it's 99 bucks.
[00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:41.620]   Yeah.
[00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:42.620]   I think it's so cheap.
[00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:43.620]   How much was that?
[00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:44.620]   This one will be 199.
[00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:45.620]   I think of it back.
[00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:47.460]   This is not my phone.
[00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:48.700]   I just got it for a while.
[00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:49.700]   It's a review unit.
[00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:50.700]   Yeah.
[00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:54.780]   But I might go into the Ryzen store now that I've played with it.
[00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:55.780]   I kind of like it.
[00:28:55.780 --> 00:29:00.420]   You know what I ordered that I mentioned this before is the Nokia N900, which is no
[00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:02.180]   Kia's tablet.
[00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:03.180]   And it's on MIMO.
[00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:07.020]   It's another Linux distro called MIMO that Nokia has developed.
[00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:08.660]   It looks very sweet.
[00:29:08.660 --> 00:29:09.660]   I have the N...
[00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:10.660]   You have the N...
[00:29:10.660 --> 00:29:11.660]   You have the N...
[00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:12.660]   Yeah, I have the N900.
[00:29:12.660 --> 00:29:13.660]   I used to have...
[00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:14.660]   I didn't like it that much.
[00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:15.660]   It's like 800 N...
[00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:16.660]   The H10.
[00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:17.660]   This is going to be better.
[00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:18.660]   It was sluggish.
[00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:19.660]   And I couldn't really figure out what to do with it or when I needed it.
[00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:20.660]   This has a phone in it.
[00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:21.660]   Right.
[00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:22.660]   That's the difference.
[00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:23.660]   It's now your phone.
[00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:24.660]   That's what I wanted from that.
[00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:25.660]   Yeah.
[00:29:25.660 --> 00:29:26.660]   Which carrier would that be on?
[00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:27.660]   It's unlocked.
[00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:28.660]   I'll have to put it on T-Mobile.
[00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:32.460]   It's designed for the T-Mobile frequencies as well as other world frequencies.
[00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:33.460]   So it'll work well.
[00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:37.300]   Well, Verizon customers are always belly-aching that they don't have the phone choices.
[00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:38.300]   Well, we don't.
[00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:42.420]   So now with the Droid and then the Airis, they're going to have a lot more.
[00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:44.700]   We're going to see a ton of Android phones too.
[00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:45.700]   This is just the beginning.
[00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:46.700]   Yeah.
[00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:50.580]   This is going to be in the same way it was the golden age of the internet for the last
[00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:56.260]   couple of years with Microsoft, Google, Yahoo, AOL, all battling it out for features and
[00:29:56.260 --> 00:29:57.660]   offering stuff for free.
[00:29:57.660 --> 00:29:58.660]   That's what we're going into now.
[00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:03.580]   It's going to be the golden age for development of these platforms with the bandwidth, increasing,
[00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:08.540]   screen size, increasing, processor speed and now these developers charged up in a monetization
[00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:09.540]   system.
[00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:11.260]   I mean, there's going to be things that are coming out.
[00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:14.260]   I was talking to some people about biometrics.
[00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:18.180]   If you've ever known anybody who had a heart attack, they have them put a thing on their
[00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:19.820]   side, the halter monitor.
[00:30:19.820 --> 00:30:24.500]   That monitor is your heart rate for 24 hours and then you listen to the tapes and look for
[00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:27.020]   patterns and stuff like that.
[00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:30.620]   The Fitbit, which was one of the TechCrunch 50 companies two years ago, just launched where
[00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:31.620]   you put it on your side.
[00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:36.180]   It recognizes when you're sleeping and how many walks you take like a pedometer.
[00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:40.460]   These things are all going to start these new hardware sensors are going to start to
[00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:42.500]   be put on your phones or whatnot.
[00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:48.500]   You're going to be able to monitor this whole, there's a term for it that these Tim O'Reilly
[00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:49.580]   geeks have been calling it.
[00:30:49.580 --> 00:30:53.460]   I forgot the name of it, but a lot of good things start in his food camp or whatever.
[00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:56.060]   It's monitoring yourself obsessively.
[00:30:56.060 --> 00:30:58.060]   Biometrics or stuff like that.
[00:30:58.060 --> 00:31:00.980]   You're talking about Gordon Bell.
[00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:03.020]   They have a buzzword for it.
[00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:04.020]   He wrote a book.
[00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:05.020]   It's called Life.
[00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:07.260]   It'll be in the chat room.
[00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:09.380]   Basically, this is for OCD people.
[00:31:09.380 --> 00:31:12.940]   Typically programmers who got too fat and then they started, there's like Ozzy Stories.
[00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:16.100]   You can find these websites like a programmer who got 100 pounds overweight and then they
[00:31:16.100 --> 00:31:19.300]   monitored their calories and put it in Excel spreadsheet and then did a program and then
[00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:22.620]   they walked a certain amount and they knew their exact net in, net out calories and then
[00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:24.140]   they watched themselves get really skinny.
[00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:29.540]   I saw something at iStage last week in Phoenix, this company that had developed a technology
[00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:33.660]   that takes your biometric reading such as your pulse and your temperature and your heart
[00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:39.100]   rate and all of that stuff from in ear systems that can be built into your existing Bluetooth
[00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:42.180]   headset or your earbuds or whatever it is that you already have.
[00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:43.180]   Oh, geez, yes.
[00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:46.220]   Yeah, I mean, and it worked pretty well and the guy sort of did some jumping jacks and
[00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:49.620]   then ran around the stage a bit and it gave a real time feed and then you can-
[00:31:49.620 --> 00:31:50.740]   It's like the Fitbit, right?
[00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:55.060]   It is like the Fitbit but I don't have to put another gadget on my person because I'm already
[00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:58.340]   carrying around in earbuds or I don't use a good gadget.
[00:31:58.340 --> 00:31:59.820]   Add to that a camera.
[00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:00.820]   This is what Bell does.
[00:32:00.820 --> 00:32:02.660]   He calls it the Sense Cam.
[00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:06.620]   He's a Microsoft researcher but he also was the founder of Digital Equipment.
[00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:09.420]   His book is Total Recall and he takes it.
[00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:13.460]   The camera takes a picture every few seconds of everything he's doing and done.
[00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:15.740]   Not internally, I hope, not inside his personal thing.
[00:32:15.740 --> 00:32:17.460]   No, it's around his neck.
[00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:23.060]   But the idea is that you create this live stream, a mountain of data that is everything you've
[00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:25.300]   ever done records everything you've ever seen.
[00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:27.460]   It might as well get the bio data as well.
[00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:29.180]   Who's going to look at this?
[00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:33.300]   I don't know but I guess if it's searchable, you never-
[00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:34.300]   He's-
[00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:40.260]   You know, his wife, Gwen Bell, who founded the Computer History Museum in the South Bay,
[00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:42.340]   passed away of Alzheimer's eventually.
[00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:45.780]   She has Alzheimer's and I think he's probably moved a little bit by the notion of as she
[00:32:45.780 --> 00:32:47.780]   forgot her life.
[00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:51.900]   This idea that you'd have everything recorded.
[00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:52.900]   Your brain.
[00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:55.940]   This was actually a William Gibson novel in the Aduro series.
[00:32:55.940 --> 00:33:00.420]   He had little Zeppelins, balloons that would float above you.
[00:33:00.420 --> 00:33:03.660]   Almost like in Sim City, they had that little thing that floats above you like the crystal
[00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:04.820]   or whatever.
[00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:08.420]   And people would be walking around a club or the city and it would have multiple camera
[00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:12.140]   angles streaming back to some sort of somewhere that would record your whole life and then
[00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:16.420]   you could either sell access to your life or go back and get it.
[00:33:16.420 --> 00:33:19.900]   If you include the biometric data and imagine you get an injury and they're like, "Well,
[00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:24.500]   we actually looking back, it looks like on September 17th, was something happened because
[00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:28.660]   it looks like you fell and that might have been when you hurt your knee."
[00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:32.060]   Can you rewind if you have all of this data?
[00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:33.060]   You could search.
[00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:34.060]   Well, undo.
[00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:35.060]   I don't know.
[00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:36.060]   You don't know what I'm going to do yet.
[00:33:36.060 --> 00:33:37.060]   I'm going to make girls see my life.
[00:33:37.060 --> 00:33:38.060]   That would be nice.
[00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:40.900]   I would like to pay some stuff that happened when I was 23.
[00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:44.540]   I'd like to make myself back into that night.
[00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:45.660]   It's pretty good night.
[00:33:45.660 --> 00:33:51.820]   The article, very interesting article in abovethecrowd.com, says Google redefines disruption, the less
[00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:54.100]   than free business model.
[00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:55.660]   Some interesting quotes about Android.
[00:33:55.660 --> 00:33:59.740]   Android is not only a phone OS, it's a consumer electronics OS.
[00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:03.580]   If 4 to BMW wanted to build an in-dash Android GPS, guess what?
[00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:05.060]   Google gives it to them for free.
[00:34:05.060 --> 00:34:12.540]   And then the kicker, and Google gives you ad splits on search if you use their version.
[00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:16.260]   Google in effect pays you to use their mobile OS.
[00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:18.700]   That's why he calls it the less than free business model.
[00:34:18.700 --> 00:34:20.700]   That makes sense.
[00:34:20.700 --> 00:34:23.460]   Jason, you're a search mogul.
[00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:24.460]   Yeah.
[00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:25.460]   Absolutely.
[00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:32.740]   There's also an anti-competitive law against this when you sell something in the market
[00:34:32.740 --> 00:34:34.300]   for less than it's worth.
[00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:38.260]   This is a whole new brave world where it's like I'm giving something away essentially
[00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:40.540]   to kill a competitor.
[00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:50.020]   If Google is giving away office right now, essentially to kick Microsoft where it hurts.
[00:34:50.020 --> 00:34:51.500]   They want to destroy office.
[00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:57.420]   Not because they gain anything by destroying office, because they hurt Microsoft and where
[00:34:57.420 --> 00:34:59.580]   their revenue is.
[00:34:59.580 --> 00:35:01.740]   That's why Microsoft is so obsessed with search as well.
[00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:04.340]   Low search, them getting into search means a revenue model.
[00:35:04.340 --> 00:35:08.580]   But look how much money Firefox makes from Google because they've got a Google search
[00:35:08.580 --> 00:35:09.580]   box in Firefox.
[00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:10.580]   Sure.
[00:35:10.580 --> 00:35:13.300]   Extend that model to everything if the operating system is Android.
[00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:18.660]   I mean, if you follow the logical conclusion, eventually they would give hardware away for
[00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:19.660]   free.
[00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:25.060]   If a netbook cost $300, $400, you can easily make that back in EdSense.
[00:35:25.060 --> 00:35:26.820]   Not easily, but you might be able to.
[00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:30.300]   And if you certainly, if every time you open the computer, you play at a 30-second spot
[00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:34.940]   or you had to watch five 30-second spots a day, at some point it would pay for itself.
[00:35:34.940 --> 00:35:40.020]   And Bill Gross, a videalab who created Overture, which was essentially what Google's become
[00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:47.220]   with EdSense, who's pretty much the most underrated genius of our time.
[00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:48.220]   He saw this.
[00:35:48.220 --> 00:35:49.220]   He had a comical free PC.
[00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:50.220]   Right.
[00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:51.460]   And you could buy a PC.
[00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:52.460]   It was essentially free.
[00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:54.180]   It was like $20 a month for the ISP.
[00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:58.980]   You got the PC for free and had a little toolbar at the bottom that had battery ads go by.
[00:35:58.980 --> 00:36:02.540]   And they've sent out, I think, tens of thousands of these computers and they were making a
[00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:03.540]   network.
[00:36:03.540 --> 00:36:04.540]   Guess what?
[00:36:04.540 --> 00:36:09.340]   If you had the ability, if you were NBC or something, you had a lot of video inventory.
[00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:13.700]   If you put out a computer that every time you booted it forced a commercial, sure, it
[00:36:13.700 --> 00:36:16.460]   would make a ton of money.
[00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:18.100]   By the way, Father Crowd is Bill Grirly.
[00:36:18.100 --> 00:36:20.420]   He's a famous venture capitalist from Benchmark.
[00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:21.500]   Oh, you know him, OK.
[00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:22.500]   I know Bill.
[00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:23.500]   He's a really smart player.
[00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:24.500]   It's a very good art.
[00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:25.500]   Yeah.
[00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:26.500]   Not a good poker player.
[00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:29.740]   It's a lot of money at the conference.
[00:36:29.740 --> 00:36:31.740]   A lot of money.
[00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:34.340]   Well, it's good because I'm going to start reading this because this was a very, I thought
[00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:35.340]   a very insightful.
[00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:37.860]   He did eBay.
[00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:39.020]   He did eBay, OK.
[00:36:39.020 --> 00:36:45.260]   There's a book called eBoys that you can get an audible about Benchmark and their company.
[00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:48.700]   It's a VC firm that's known for having all partners who are over six foot.
[00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:49.700]   Oh, really?
[00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:50.700]   Yeah.
[00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:51.700]   It's the tall guys.
[00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:52.700]   Basically.
[00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:53.700]   Benchmark.
[00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:54.700]   That's funny.
[00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:56.340]   Yeah, I've heard a benchmark, of course, but I didn't know Bill Grirly's name.
[00:36:56.340 --> 00:36:58.940]   It's a good-- above the crowd.com, it's a good blog.
[00:36:58.940 --> 00:37:02.020]   He writes a blog once every two months, but when he does, it's really good.
[00:37:02.020 --> 00:37:04.460]   Yeah, it's very insightful on this subject.
[00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:05.460]   Yeah.
[00:37:05.460 --> 00:37:11.460]   It's not Android running on an e-reader, again, at iStage, which is the launch event for CEA
[00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:13.740]   into their CES show.
[00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:14.740]   And I liked this one a lot.
[00:37:14.740 --> 00:37:17.020]   And I think it spoke to your point.
[00:37:17.020 --> 00:37:21.300]   It was called The Edge, and it was running Android, and it had one screen was e-ink,
[00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:23.300]   and the other was a netbook tablet.
[00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:27.100]   There was no keyboard, but you could double click on the text on the left side, and it
[00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:30.580]   would either launch a video on the other side, whatever the author wanted you to see,
[00:37:30.580 --> 00:37:31.580]   would launch a hyperlink.
[00:37:31.580 --> 00:37:32.820]   It was kind of a hybrid thing.
[00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:34.380]   Yeah, it was really immersive.
[00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:35.380]   I liked it a lot.
[00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:39.500]   A friend of mine called it a never-ending story kind of experience, because you can
[00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:43.940]   take the existing story and then augment it with video or audio or whatever.
[00:37:43.940 --> 00:37:45.740]   Addictionery was nice.
[00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:49.940]   All of this stuff is converging in such a way that now we're seeing amazing creativity.
[00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:52.020]   We've got developers who are getting it.
[00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:55.300]   We've got a convergence of internet.
[00:37:55.300 --> 00:38:01.460]   It's cheap, small hardware, and we're getting some really interesting uses of all this stuff.
[00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:02.820]   That's very innovative, I think.
[00:38:02.820 --> 00:38:04.300]   Yeah, I think so, too.
[00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:08.740]   It's going to amount to manufacturing at this point, because it's a beautiful device, but
[00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:14.220]   they have to get it right, and they have to make sure that it's going to launch in at
[00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:19.820]   CES in January, but it'll cost over $400, which is too much for a device like that.
[00:38:19.820 --> 00:38:25.460]   What do you think, Leo, in terms of the market share of Android?
[00:38:25.460 --> 00:38:28.780]   I think if I were a developer, if I were that 14-year-old kid we were talking about, I'd
[00:38:28.780 --> 00:38:29.780]   be writing for Android.
[00:38:29.780 --> 00:38:30.980]   I'd be learning Android right now.
[00:38:30.980 --> 00:38:32.180]   I think this is the way to go.
[00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:37.220]   I think that Google's not going to sit still until Android's everywhere.
[00:38:37.220 --> 00:38:38.220]   Right.
[00:38:38.220 --> 00:38:44.140]   All that competition in the hardware space has got to lead to a better product than iPhone,
[00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:46.220]   perhaps, or products that would be more...
[00:38:46.220 --> 00:38:48.340]   Well, this is what we were waiting for for a whole year.
[00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:51.540]   They were stuck with this crappy G1 hardware.
[00:38:51.540 --> 00:38:54.740]   Now they've got some decent hardware, and I think we're just going to start seeing this
[00:38:54.740 --> 00:38:56.260]   snowball.
[00:38:56.260 --> 00:39:01.220]   And I think, and I've tweeted this, and I sense a backlash against Apple.
[00:39:01.220 --> 00:39:03.220]   People are starting to turn a little bit against Apple.
[00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:06.860]   They're feeling a little bit like Apple has become the big monopoly that Microsoft used
[00:39:06.860 --> 00:39:07.860]   to be.
[00:39:07.860 --> 00:39:08.860]   They're the Yankees.
[00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:10.660]   Yeah, they're the Yankees all of a sudden.
[00:39:10.660 --> 00:39:11.660]   Yeah, easy.
[00:39:11.660 --> 00:39:12.660]   They're the Yankees.
[00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:13.820]   Do the Yankees win last night?
[00:39:13.820 --> 00:39:15.460]   Boy, they sure turn it around, huh?
[00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:17.460]   Yeah, it's kind of ugly.
[00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:19.460]   Yeah, the Yankees win.
[00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:20.740]   It's not over yet.
[00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:21.740]   Not at all.
[00:39:21.740 --> 00:39:22.740]   Not at all.
[00:39:22.740 --> 00:39:23.740]   Any Yankees, it's over.
[00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:24.740]   No, I think I win.
[00:39:24.740 --> 00:39:25.740]   I think I win.
[00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:26.740]   No, it's a series.
[00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:27.740]   If they play the Angels, it wouldn't be over.
[00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:28.740]   But they're playing the Yankees.
[00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:29.740]   It's over.
[00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:30.740]   Hey, did you...
[00:39:30.740 --> 00:39:36.020]   Anybody watch the last Sunday after Twitter, I was working a little bit late, and I turned
[00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:38.060]   on YouTube, and I saw, "Oh, YouTube.
[00:39:38.060 --> 00:39:41.260]   YouTube is doing a concert on YouTube live from the Rose Bowl.
[00:39:41.260 --> 00:39:42.940]   I watched a couple of hours.
[00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:43.940]   Never but for...
[00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:44.940]   Unbelievable.
[00:39:44.940 --> 00:39:45.940]   Perfect quality.
[00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:46.940]   Unbelievable.
[00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:47.940]   I don't know how many they served.
[00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:48.940]   They aren't saying...
[00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:49.940]   10 million.
[00:39:49.940 --> 00:39:50.940]   Well, they're being cagey.
[00:39:50.940 --> 00:39:52.220]   10 million during the entire concert.
[00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:54.540]   I don't know how many at any one time, right?
[00:39:54.540 --> 00:39:55.540]   Half a million.
[00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:56.540]   Easily.
[00:39:56.540 --> 00:39:57.540]   Maybe a million concurrent, right?
[00:39:57.540 --> 00:39:59.140]   That's got to be a record.
[00:39:59.140 --> 00:40:02.980]   The biggest number I ever heard was live 8 and AOL did 180,000.
[00:40:02.980 --> 00:40:03.980]   Right.
[00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:07.020]   They did have themselves on the back and said it was the biggest live streaming concert.
[00:40:07.020 --> 00:40:11.180]   But they're not saying exactly what the peak number was.
[00:40:11.180 --> 00:40:12.180]   But still, yeah, it's got to be half a million.
[00:40:12.180 --> 00:40:15.620]   If you've got 10 million people in two hours, it's got to be a million.
[00:40:15.620 --> 00:40:16.620]   It's going to be two million.
[00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:21.180]   I believe that the few fighters did it just a few days ago as well, and they didn't even
[00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:22.580]   come close to that.
[00:40:22.580 --> 00:40:24.380]   The quality.
[00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:25.380]   How do they do it?
[00:40:25.380 --> 00:40:26.380]   I mean, I thought you...
[00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:32.020]   Now, I should point out, the reason I bring it up is we're blown away.
[00:40:32.020 --> 00:40:33.020]   And rightly so.
[00:40:33.020 --> 00:40:36.980]   I mean, this is streaming internet video, beautiful quality, millions of simultaneous
[00:40:36.980 --> 00:40:37.980]   views.
[00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:41.460]   But that pales to the number of people that watched the World Series last night or will
[00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:44.820]   watch Monday night football tomorrow night.
[00:40:44.820 --> 00:40:47.020]   You're still far away from TV capabilities.
[00:40:47.020 --> 00:40:48.420]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:40:48.420 --> 00:40:49.420]   We're not far away from TV.
[00:40:49.420 --> 00:40:51.340]   10 million people coming to see something.
[00:40:51.340 --> 00:40:55.220]   You know, how many unique, let's say, two or three million unique or whatever.
[00:40:55.220 --> 00:40:57.220]   I don't know, maybe they're sounding 10 million.
[00:40:57.220 --> 00:40:59.220]   No, they're not saying unique.
[00:40:59.220 --> 00:41:00.220]   Yeah.
[00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:01.580]   So think about it on a global basis.
[00:41:01.580 --> 00:41:07.140]   If you could put YouTube or the Super Bowl or any of these things on TV, it's going to
[00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:09.820]   be huge.
[00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:15.020]   I mean, we're going to have a global market for watching things that has never existed.
[00:41:15.020 --> 00:41:18.460]   And if you think about Twitter, how did you find out about the YouTube concept?
[00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:19.460]   I found out on Twitter.
[00:41:19.460 --> 00:41:20.460]   Probably, yeah.
[00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:21.940]   Everybody found out Twitter.
[00:41:21.940 --> 00:41:22.940]   Twitter's the new TV guide now.
[00:41:22.940 --> 00:41:24.940]   I mean, Twitter's where you find out what's going on.
[00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:26.940]   TV guide would be diminishing Twitter's value.
[00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:31.820]   Twitter, Twitter, I've said it's the internet nervous system is what it really is.
[00:41:31.820 --> 00:41:36.740]   It's how it's the signaling system for the entire internet now.
[00:41:36.740 --> 00:41:37.740]   Correct.
[00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:40.940]   And one of the functions is, hey, everybody watch this.
[00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:41.940]   Right.
[00:41:41.940 --> 00:41:43.860]   And that's never existed before.
[00:41:43.860 --> 00:41:46.860]   Everybody watch this now and boom trending topic.
[00:41:46.860 --> 00:41:47.860]   YouTube.
[00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:49.300]   It's the only thing that's up here.
[00:41:49.300 --> 00:41:50.300]   No, it's true.
[00:41:50.300 --> 00:41:52.940]   Natalie brought down our streaming by tweeting that she's going to be on Twitter.
[00:41:52.940 --> 00:41:53.940]   The streaming went down.
[00:41:53.940 --> 00:41:55.260]   I just had 10 people tell me the same thing.
[00:41:55.260 --> 00:41:58.940]   I tweeted it and I, and everybody's like, it just tries to get on.
[00:41:58.940 --> 00:41:59.940]   It went down.
[00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:02.300]   So I got to talk to YouTube.
[00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:03.300]   We're good.
[00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:07.660]   I mean, I don't think we have 10 million people trying to watch, although with Natalie,
[00:42:07.660 --> 00:42:08.660]   yeah, it could be.
[00:42:08.660 --> 00:42:11.140]   But it's really interesting.
[00:42:11.140 --> 00:42:13.340]   I think that we are headed towards that convergence.
[00:42:13.340 --> 00:42:16.020]   I just wonder how long before the capabilities they are.
[00:42:16.020 --> 00:42:18.900]   And when did you stream say they were going to be, I'm, when did you stream?
[00:42:18.900 --> 00:42:20.740]   When did YouTube say they were going to be you stream?
[00:42:20.740 --> 00:42:22.380]   When did they say they were going to be a streaming company?
[00:42:22.380 --> 00:42:24.260]   They said that over a year ago.
[00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:25.260]   It's been at least a year and a half.
[00:42:25.260 --> 00:42:26.260]   Right.
[00:42:26.260 --> 00:42:27.260]   Maybe this is what they meant them.
[00:42:27.260 --> 00:42:28.260]   Maybe they didn't mean for everybody anytime.
[00:42:28.260 --> 00:42:29.260]   Right.
[00:42:29.260 --> 00:42:30.260]   I think they just had a test it.
[00:42:30.260 --> 00:42:31.260]   Well, they can do it for you two.
[00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:32.260]   They could probably let other people do it.
[00:42:32.260 --> 00:42:33.260]   You don't test it with you two.
[00:42:33.260 --> 00:42:35.580]   One of the most popular rock bands ever.
[00:42:35.580 --> 00:42:36.580]   You think they would test it with?
[00:42:36.580 --> 00:42:38.260]   It's not a test.
[00:42:38.260 --> 00:42:39.260]   That's the real deal.
[00:42:39.260 --> 00:42:40.260]   Yeah.
[00:42:40.260 --> 00:42:41.420]   We can just get you two on.
[00:42:41.420 --> 00:42:46.140]   Although I'm in thinking about this Twitter nervous system that you're talking about,
[00:42:46.140 --> 00:42:50.340]   I think not to jump ahead too far in the stories, but these Twitter lists are a way to filter
[00:42:50.340 --> 00:42:52.020]   out the noise and just start to.
[00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:53.020]   All right.
[00:42:53.020 --> 00:42:54.020]   We're going to take a break.
[00:42:54.020 --> 00:42:55.020]   Let's talk about lists.
[00:42:55.020 --> 00:42:56.300]   I really think that's a good subject and I do want to get to that.
[00:42:56.300 --> 00:42:58.580]   I think Patrick Norton is ready to join us.
[00:42:58.580 --> 00:43:00.020]   Hey, there he is.
[00:43:00.020 --> 00:43:06.340]   So when we come back, Patrick Norton and Twitter lists, we continue with Natalie Del Conti,
[00:43:06.340 --> 00:43:10.980]   her first time with me on Twitter, but second time on Twitter and Jason Callicanis in just
[00:43:10.980 --> 00:43:12.500]   a little bit before we do that.
[00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:18.740]   I do want to talk about our friendly sponsors from the folks at Citrix and go to meeting.
[00:43:18.740 --> 00:43:19.740]   Do you ever use GoToMeeting?
[00:43:19.740 --> 00:43:26.980]   Jason, you know, I was going to steal your idea, the TechCrunch50 idea, and we were going
[00:43:26.980 --> 00:43:27.980]   to do the Twit12.
[00:43:27.980 --> 00:43:28.980]   Oh, yeah.
[00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:31.220]   We'd go do it with GoToMeeting.
[00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:32.220]   Sure.
[00:43:32.220 --> 00:43:36.260]   And we were going to have 12 people who had a good idea come on and they had to use GoToMeeting
[00:43:36.260 --> 00:43:37.260]   to demonstrate it.
[00:43:37.260 --> 00:43:38.260]   Perfect idea.
[00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:39.860]   I thought it would be so much fun, you know?
[00:43:39.860 --> 00:43:40.860]   Great idea.
[00:43:40.860 --> 00:43:48.860]   And ironically, for TechCrunch50, we use GoToMeeting and I do about 250 meetings in the course
[00:43:48.860 --> 00:43:54.780]   of two weeks and we do about 500 meetings over that period and they're all virtual or
[00:43:54.780 --> 00:43:56.780]   90% of them and they all use GoToMeeting.
[00:43:56.780 --> 00:43:57.780]   Boom.
[00:43:57.780 --> 00:44:01.180]   I mean, some people use some of the other products, but it's majority GoToMeeting and
[00:44:01.180 --> 00:44:02.740]   I can tell you it works flawlessly.
[00:44:02.740 --> 00:44:03.740]   I mean, I don't like that.
[00:44:03.740 --> 00:44:05.740]   Yeah, I won't do a meeting with anybody.
[00:44:05.740 --> 00:44:06.740]   I'm pretty spoiled.
[00:44:06.740 --> 00:44:07.740]   We got a special deal.
[00:44:07.740 --> 00:44:08.740]   You could try it free.
[00:44:08.740 --> 00:44:10.740]   So here's the deal with GoToMeeting.
[00:44:10.740 --> 00:44:11.740]   You set it up.
[00:44:11.740 --> 00:44:16.580]   You could set it up before the show's over just by going to gotoMeeting.com/twit.
[00:44:16.580 --> 00:44:18.100]   It'll take you two minutes.
[00:44:18.100 --> 00:44:21.140]   Once it's on your system, the next time you're on a conference call and you're saying, "Boy,
[00:44:21.140 --> 00:44:22.140]   this is boring.
[00:44:22.140 --> 00:44:23.140]   I'm gone.
[00:44:23.140 --> 00:44:24.140]   I'm going to sleep."
[00:44:24.140 --> 00:44:27.340]   You suddenly bring it alive by saying, "All right, everybody, let's go to gotoMeeting.com."
[00:44:27.340 --> 00:44:28.340]   Here's the meeting ID.
[00:44:28.340 --> 00:44:30.740]   Now they're seeing your computer or you're seeing theirs.
[00:44:30.740 --> 00:44:31.780]   You can switch it back and forth.
[00:44:31.780 --> 00:44:33.660]   You can collaborate together on a single product.
[00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:34.660]   You could do product demos.
[00:44:34.660 --> 00:44:36.340]   You could do training sessions.
[00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:41.620]   You could do sales presentations fast in real time securely.
[00:44:41.620 --> 00:44:44.700]   You get free phone and voiceover IP conferencing.
[00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:46.500]   I want you to try it free for 30 days.
[00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:50.860]   Go to meeting.com/twit.
[00:44:50.860 --> 00:44:55.300]   There are other online meeting solutions, but this is the one.
[00:44:55.300 --> 00:44:56.780]   There's just no question about it.
[00:44:56.780 --> 00:45:00.100]   If you're serious about business, you use that one and it's free.
[00:45:00.100 --> 00:45:03.940]   So just go try it and you'll see it's not that expensive anyway, but it's one of those
[00:45:03.940 --> 00:45:05.300]   things that's just well worth it.
[00:45:05.300 --> 00:45:06.300]   Oh, yeah.
[00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:07.300]   Every penny.
[00:45:07.300 --> 00:45:10.580]   We have three or four counts now because we have our hosts using it.
[00:45:10.580 --> 00:45:12.660]   All right, let me get Patrick Norton in here.
[00:45:12.660 --> 00:45:17.380]   I have to press a button or two because I have to change the configuration of the Fremitz
[00:45:17.380 --> 00:45:18.380]   rod.
[00:45:18.380 --> 00:45:19.380]   Hello, Patrick Norton.
[00:45:19.380 --> 00:45:21.340]   Yeah, the Fremitz rod.
[00:45:21.340 --> 00:45:24.980]   He's going to be on number six left.
[00:45:24.980 --> 00:45:26.860]   All right.
[00:45:26.860 --> 00:45:27.860]   There we go.
[00:45:27.860 --> 00:45:30.980]   Patrick Norton, say hello.
[00:45:30.980 --> 00:45:31.980]   Now he's not saying anything.
[00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:33.660]   What are you being so quiet for?
[00:45:33.660 --> 00:45:34.660]   Are you there, Patrick?
[00:45:34.660 --> 00:45:39.700]   I turned the mute on so my horrible, Hazel breathing didn't come over the line.
[00:45:39.700 --> 00:45:43.980]   So my clever, clever technical accuracy has taken me out once again.
[00:45:43.980 --> 00:45:46.020]   So we, I didn't see an email yesterday.
[00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:50.100]   So I figured you were booked up and then I, no, no, we got the text message and like,
[00:45:50.100 --> 00:45:52.460]   put down the baby and grabbed the baby.
[00:45:52.460 --> 00:45:54.100]   Grab the old ladies.
[00:45:54.100 --> 00:45:56.340]   Everybody go, my parents are in town.
[00:45:56.340 --> 00:45:58.940]   So they're actually getting more full on baby time.
[00:45:58.940 --> 00:46:01.820]   So Natalie brought her mom to the studio in case.
[00:46:01.820 --> 00:46:03.420]   My parents are in town too.
[00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:04.420]   We needed babies.
[00:46:04.420 --> 00:46:05.420]   But they live here.
[00:46:05.420 --> 00:46:07.060]   Patrick, you know, Natalie Dale Conti, I'm sure.
[00:46:07.060 --> 00:46:08.060]   Yes.
[00:46:08.060 --> 00:46:09.060]   We used to work on the same floor.
[00:46:09.060 --> 00:46:10.060]   Right next door.
[00:46:10.060 --> 00:46:11.060]   Uh huh.
[00:46:11.060 --> 00:46:12.060]   Our cubicles shared the wall.
[00:46:12.060 --> 00:46:13.060]   We both faced each other.
[00:46:13.060 --> 00:46:15.260]   Did he ever punch a hole in that wall?
[00:46:15.260 --> 00:46:17.060]   Um, no, he never punched a hole in that wall.
[00:46:17.060 --> 00:46:18.060]   Then you didn't know him that well.
[00:46:18.060 --> 00:46:19.540]   Yeah, but I could hear him.
[00:46:19.540 --> 00:46:20.540]   I could hear him.
[00:46:20.540 --> 00:46:21.860]   I punched one cabinet.
[00:46:21.860 --> 00:46:23.980]   There was one cabinet punching incident.
[00:46:23.980 --> 00:46:25.380]   I went there for this.
[00:46:25.380 --> 00:46:29.540]   And I, I went and apologized to everyone in the row that I went to the person that was
[00:46:29.540 --> 00:46:32.420]   responsible for my hire and their manager.
[00:46:32.420 --> 00:46:34.300]   And we resolved the issue.
[00:46:34.300 --> 00:46:38.660]   It resolved stories being stolen from the screensavers for an unprepared show.
[00:46:38.660 --> 00:46:39.660]   There you go.
[00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:41.260]   Fill their times and say no one to write for them.
[00:46:41.260 --> 00:46:45.540]   I had every right to and I'll never forget the dented look at that cabinet to the end
[00:46:45.540 --> 00:46:46.540]   of its days.
[00:46:46.540 --> 00:46:50.420]   My dad likes to say you should you lose your cool about once or twice a year so people
[00:46:50.420 --> 00:46:51.420]   know what you're made of.
[00:46:51.420 --> 00:46:52.420]   You know what?
[00:46:52.420 --> 00:46:53.420]   I think he's right.
[00:46:53.420 --> 00:46:54.420]   I'm out of mentium.
[00:46:54.420 --> 00:46:55.420]   Thank you.
[00:46:55.420 --> 00:46:56.420]   I think he's absolutely right.
[00:46:56.420 --> 00:46:57.420]   I think that that's very good.
[00:46:57.420 --> 00:46:58.420]   He's completely lose it.
[00:46:58.420 --> 00:46:59.620]   I haven't done it yet this year.
[00:46:59.620 --> 00:47:01.620]   So maybe today will be the day.
[00:47:01.620 --> 00:47:03.100]   We're only in the show.
[00:47:03.100 --> 00:47:04.700]   I can't imagine you losing your cool.
[00:47:04.700 --> 00:47:06.780]   I mean, what do you look like when you lose your cool?
[00:47:06.780 --> 00:47:08.820]   Do you like to do you really?
[00:47:08.820 --> 00:47:09.820]   Right.
[00:47:09.820 --> 00:47:10.820]   I cry.
[00:47:10.820 --> 00:47:11.820]   I'm just a good girl.
[00:47:11.820 --> 00:47:13.580]   I don't think that's what dad meant.
[00:47:13.580 --> 00:47:14.900]   No, I hate to say it.
[00:47:14.900 --> 00:47:18.020]   I'm still working on how to lose my cool effectively.
[00:47:18.020 --> 00:47:19.700]   I watched the last detail last night.
[00:47:19.700 --> 00:47:21.660]   Jack Nicholson teaching Randy Quaid.
[00:47:21.660 --> 00:47:22.660]   Have to lose his cool.
[00:47:22.660 --> 00:47:23.980]   It's a great moment.
[00:47:23.980 --> 00:47:24.980]   It's a beautiful moment.
[00:47:24.980 --> 00:47:29.260]   It's one of Randy Quaid's greatest acting moments, not that there are so many of them.
[00:47:29.260 --> 00:47:30.900]   But I love you, Randy.
[00:47:30.900 --> 00:47:32.780]   I'm just saying that was his best.
[00:47:32.780 --> 00:47:33.780]   This was his movie.
[00:47:33.780 --> 00:47:35.340]   Yeah, no, that was a wonderful movie.
[00:47:35.340 --> 00:47:36.940]   I haven't seen that in ages.
[00:47:36.940 --> 00:47:40.340]   Actually speaking of like getting really angry, you guys may have talked about this already,
[00:47:40.340 --> 00:47:43.780]   but Jason, how is the war against these scumbags going?
[00:47:43.780 --> 00:47:46.140]   Actually, it's really good.
[00:47:46.140 --> 00:47:47.700]   Why don't you set this up?
[00:47:47.700 --> 00:47:48.700]   Yeah.
[00:47:48.700 --> 00:47:49.700]   So people know what you're talking about.
[00:47:49.700 --> 00:47:50.700]   Yeah.
[00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:51.700]   All right.
[00:47:51.700 --> 00:47:57.980]   I had a couple of companies from TechCrunch, Shifty, call me and say, "Listen, should I
[00:47:57.980 --> 00:47:59.260]   do this Corezzo for?
[00:47:59.260 --> 00:48:05.100]   Should I do this Mike Siegel thing in New York where you pay and then you present to angel
[00:48:05.100 --> 00:48:06.100]   investors?"
[00:48:06.100 --> 00:48:08.100]   And I said, "What?"
[00:48:08.100 --> 00:48:11.420]   And they said, "Yeah, you pay and then you get to talk to rich people who might invest
[00:48:11.420 --> 00:48:12.420]   in your company."
[00:48:12.420 --> 00:48:13.420]   I'm like, "I'm sorry.
[00:48:13.420 --> 00:48:15.660]   I know all the top angel investors in the world.
[00:48:15.660 --> 00:48:18.300]   They don't charge you to pitch them.
[00:48:18.300 --> 00:48:20.460]   They want to hear pitches because they--
[00:48:20.460 --> 00:48:22.460]   They're working money off of you in the long run.
[00:48:22.460 --> 00:48:24.460]   They make money if they invest in your company.
[00:48:24.460 --> 00:48:26.940]   It's like they are-- you're doing them a service by giving them the opportunity to invest
[00:48:26.940 --> 00:48:27.940]   in your company.
[00:48:27.940 --> 00:48:28.940]   I invested in GDGT.
[00:48:28.940 --> 00:48:30.860]   Trust me, they didn't pay me to pitch.
[00:48:30.860 --> 00:48:35.100]   I chased Peter and Ryan and said, "Listen, for two years I said, 'Whatever your next company
[00:48:35.100 --> 00:48:37.020]   is, I am going to angel investor.
[00:48:37.020 --> 00:48:38.020]   Let me be the first investor.
[00:48:38.020 --> 00:48:39.020]   Let me be the first investor.
[00:48:39.020 --> 00:48:41.020]   Let me be the first investor for this.'"
[00:48:41.020 --> 00:48:44.860]   And I've done that with a couple of things with Jack Dorsey, who's the Twitter founder
[00:48:44.860 --> 00:48:47.100]   who's doing this new payment system on iPhone.
[00:48:47.100 --> 00:48:50.060]   I've got like three emails into him like, "Listen, save me a little spot.
[00:48:50.060 --> 00:48:52.300]   I really would love to be involved."
[00:48:52.300 --> 00:49:00.620]   And so long story short, these DBs-- you know what that stands for-- these DBs are
[00:49:00.620 --> 00:49:01.620]   charging people.
[00:49:01.620 --> 00:49:02.620]   Yeah, dumbbells.
[00:49:02.620 --> 00:49:04.940]   The second word is bags.
[00:49:04.940 --> 00:49:05.940]   And the first word is--
[00:49:05.940 --> 00:49:06.940]   Yeah.
[00:49:06.940 --> 00:49:07.940]   Ryan's like, "Rue."
[00:49:07.940 --> 00:49:08.940]   Yeah.
[00:49:08.940 --> 00:49:09.940]   "Stop."
[00:49:09.940 --> 00:49:10.940]   "Stop."
[00:49:10.940 --> 00:49:11.940]   Stop.
[00:49:11.940 --> 00:49:18.500]   Anyway, they were charging $1,500 to present for like 10 minutes to a bunch of angel investors
[00:49:18.500 --> 00:49:24.540]   so the guy who's a former employee sends me-- a former employee sends me a whole email
[00:49:24.540 --> 00:49:26.020]   saying like, "Listen, I worked there.
[00:49:26.020 --> 00:49:27.420]   It's a scam.
[00:49:27.420 --> 00:49:30.220]   It's filled with a bunch of lawyers and consultants.
[00:49:30.220 --> 00:49:33.540]   And you shouldn't do it.
[00:49:33.540 --> 00:49:37.460]   And not only is it $1,500, but you have to do four chapters, so it's really $6,000.
[00:49:37.460 --> 00:49:38.820]   So I say, "Listen, you shouldn't do this.
[00:49:38.820 --> 00:49:42.780]   I'm on this week in startups and I'm giving a bunch of advice.
[00:49:42.780 --> 00:49:43.780]   People don't do it.
[00:49:43.780 --> 00:49:44.780]   Don't do it."
[00:49:44.780 --> 00:49:47.420]   Anyway, so then they-- one of the guys who starts mixing it up with me, and I said, "Listen,
[00:49:47.420 --> 00:49:49.380]   you want me to go on a jihad against us, I will."
[00:49:49.380 --> 00:49:53.660]   And so I basically I started a jihad, and I said, "I'm going to destroy this thing."
[00:49:53.660 --> 00:49:58.700]   And I demanded that they drop the fees or I would launch a competing product in 30 days.
[00:49:58.700 --> 00:50:00.460]   That would be free.
[00:50:00.460 --> 00:50:07.780]   And so anyway, a week after I gave them the ultimatum, they start calling Sequoia capital,
[00:50:07.780 --> 00:50:08.940]   my investors.
[00:50:08.940 --> 00:50:12.620]   And they start emailing them and see seeing me, all these different people, and threatening
[00:50:12.620 --> 00:50:15.180]   a lawsuit.
[00:50:15.180 --> 00:50:19.940]   This is not good for me to have people calling my VC, right?
[00:50:19.940 --> 00:50:22.540]   And long story short, they drop the fees.
[00:50:22.540 --> 00:50:23.540]   Good for you.
[00:50:23.540 --> 00:50:29.620]   Now I read an interesting post by a British angel who explained why they charged, and
[00:50:29.620 --> 00:50:32.740]   he said, "Well, you want to make sure that people are committed.
[00:50:32.740 --> 00:50:33.740]   You'd be surprised."
[00:50:33.740 --> 00:50:34.740]   You're sorry.
[00:50:34.740 --> 00:50:35.740]   That's okay.
[00:50:35.740 --> 00:50:36.740]   No, no, I'm glad you're here.
[00:50:36.740 --> 00:50:37.740]   54 minutes in, put a beat.
[00:50:37.740 --> 00:50:38.740]   Yeah, no, that's all right.
[00:50:38.740 --> 00:50:39.740]   It's BS.
[00:50:39.740 --> 00:50:41.380]   That is the lamest excuse.
[00:50:41.380 --> 00:50:42.380]   They say it's to filter.
[00:50:42.380 --> 00:50:43.380]   Guess what?
[00:50:43.380 --> 00:50:44.380]   They're not out of the best companies.
[00:50:44.380 --> 00:50:45.380]   We're starting by people who are broke.
[00:50:45.380 --> 00:50:46.380]   Larry and Sergey were broke.
[00:50:46.380 --> 00:50:48.180]   They were going to pay somebody.
[00:50:48.180 --> 00:50:50.740]   He also says, "Here, I'll give you the rest of them."
[00:50:50.740 --> 00:50:52.780]   He says, "We help them.
[00:50:52.780 --> 00:50:54.220]   We work on their presentation.
[00:50:54.220 --> 00:50:55.220]   We polish it.
[00:50:55.220 --> 00:50:56.420]   We put a lot of effort into that.
[00:50:56.420 --> 00:50:58.780]   That costs money."
[00:50:58.780 --> 00:51:03.700]   I do two weeks of preparation with the tech-run-trivtic companies.
[00:51:03.700 --> 00:51:05.340]   I don't get paid for it.
[00:51:05.340 --> 00:51:07.740]   Again, they're doing this as a scam.
[00:51:07.740 --> 00:51:10.980]   It's the same as people who charge.
[00:51:10.980 --> 00:51:11.980]   You go to become a model.
[00:51:11.980 --> 00:51:14.180]   They're like, "Oh, Natalie, you're so beautiful.
[00:51:14.180 --> 00:51:16.020]   We need to send you to modeling classes.
[00:51:16.020 --> 00:51:17.020]   They're going to be $1,300.
[00:51:17.020 --> 00:51:18.020]   We need to get headshots.
[00:51:18.020 --> 00:51:19.020]   We're going to be $1,700.
[00:51:19.020 --> 00:51:20.820]   You can take a makeup class for $1,400.
[00:51:20.820 --> 00:51:21.820]   I should not do that.
[00:51:21.820 --> 00:51:24.580]   You're going to be the next Kate Moss.
[00:51:24.580 --> 00:51:26.020]   I'm telling you, you have it.
[00:51:26.020 --> 00:51:27.020]   Trust me.
[00:51:27.020 --> 00:51:30.420]   Or you have to need acting lessons or coaching lessons.
[00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:31.420]   That's BS.
[00:51:31.420 --> 00:51:35.580]   It's just a way to scam people who are desperate out of their money and as a guy who had
[00:51:35.580 --> 00:51:37.740]   to fight my way and I took personal offense to it.
[00:51:37.740 --> 00:51:41.420]   Now I've destroyed them because they said last week they weren't going to charge companies
[00:51:41.420 --> 00:51:46.820]   under $500,000 in revenue or raising money, whatever, the fees.
[00:51:46.820 --> 00:51:49.500]   There's a couple of more of these groups and I'm going to specifically target them and
[00:51:49.500 --> 00:51:51.420]   I'm going to put them out of business.
[00:51:51.420 --> 00:51:52.860]   Or they can drop the fees and I'll give them credit.
[00:51:52.860 --> 00:51:57.700]   I give credits to half credit for dropping half the fees essentially.
[00:51:57.700 --> 00:51:59.660]   I'm not going to stop until they don't.
[00:51:59.660 --> 00:52:00.660]   You know what?
[00:52:00.660 --> 00:52:03.300]   It's over now because all the entrepreneurs know it's a scam.
[00:52:03.300 --> 00:52:08.060]   I told everybody who is doing it, you need to all the entrepreneurs.
[00:52:08.060 --> 00:52:11.780]   If anybody asks you if you do this, tell them outright it's a scam.
[00:52:11.780 --> 00:52:13.660]   So now they have no customers.
[00:52:13.660 --> 00:52:15.380]   I was a little shocked actually to hear it.
[00:52:15.380 --> 00:52:18.260]   I thought they charge to pitch.
[00:52:18.260 --> 00:52:19.260]   That seems all.
[00:52:19.260 --> 00:52:20.940]   It's all undercurrent of smarmy people.
[00:52:20.940 --> 00:52:27.780]   This one guy in New York, Segal, Mike Segal, people were sending me like email after email
[00:52:27.780 --> 00:52:28.780]   from him.
[00:52:28.780 --> 00:52:30.460]   I can talk to you about raising money.
[00:52:30.460 --> 00:52:31.980]   I need your credit card number.
[00:52:31.980 --> 00:52:35.180]   It's going to be $1,000 for me to have a phone call with you.
[00:52:35.180 --> 00:52:41.660]   Then I want between $5,000 and $15,000 and 1 in 10% of your company to help you raise
[00:52:41.660 --> 00:52:42.660]   money.
[00:52:42.660 --> 00:52:43.660]   Wow.
[00:52:43.660 --> 00:52:48.420]   And this guy who I know who was a former, whatever, somebody I know did it because he
[00:52:48.420 --> 00:52:51.580]   was desperate and he presented and he said he went to present.
[00:52:51.580 --> 00:52:52.580]   There were no investors there.
[00:52:52.580 --> 00:52:55.060]   It was all people who were like lawyers.
[00:52:55.060 --> 00:52:58.620]   He said everybody afterwards came up to me and started to sell me services.
[00:52:58.620 --> 00:53:01.820]   Lawyers, headhunters, real estate agents, accountants.
[00:53:01.820 --> 00:53:06.180]   Basically, you pay to be a little fish in a shark tank.
[00:53:06.180 --> 00:53:08.500]   To pitch to someone's mom or whatever.
[00:53:08.500 --> 00:53:09.500]   Exactly.
[00:53:09.500 --> 00:53:14.500]   You know what angel investors, these guys, Ron Conway and Kevin Rose does angel investing
[00:53:14.500 --> 00:53:15.500]   now once in a while.
[00:53:15.500 --> 00:53:16.500]   I thought that was interesting.
[00:53:16.500 --> 00:53:19.780]   I've seen a number of investments that Kevin's made.
[00:53:19.780 --> 00:53:22.340]   Yeah, he'll put a $25K into something.
[00:53:22.340 --> 00:53:23.340]   That's cool.
[00:53:23.340 --> 00:53:25.380]   His name is valuable, of course.
[00:53:25.380 --> 00:53:27.340]   That's what I always do.
[00:53:27.340 --> 00:53:31.180]   I'm like, hey, you got my Twitter, you got my email newsletter.
[00:53:31.180 --> 00:53:34.260]   I'm going to help you out as best I can.
[00:53:34.260 --> 00:53:37.900]   If I can invest, it's a privilege to be to invest in these companies because all I need
[00:53:37.900 --> 00:53:42.740]   is one out of 30 to become the next anything good, Twitter, Google, whatever.
[00:53:42.740 --> 00:53:43.740]   I'm golden.
[00:53:43.740 --> 00:53:46.140]   I have a money name somewhere without any money.
[00:53:46.140 --> 00:53:47.540]   I'll give them the names.
[00:53:47.540 --> 00:53:52.700]   Little did we know Patrick, that little guy Kevin came along that someday he'd be an angel.
[00:53:52.700 --> 00:53:54.060]   We should have been good for him, man.
[00:53:54.060 --> 00:53:56.460]   We should have been nicer to him.
[00:53:56.460 --> 00:53:59.740]   Should never punch that, oh, never mind.
[00:53:59.740 --> 00:54:00.740]   You're the one who punched him.
[00:54:00.740 --> 00:54:02.220]   I didn't punch him hard.
[00:54:02.220 --> 00:54:03.700]   Who held him when he cried?
[00:54:03.700 --> 00:54:04.700]   That's right.
[00:54:04.700 --> 00:54:05.700]   I held him when he cried.
[00:54:05.700 --> 00:54:06.700]   Can we talk about?
[00:54:06.700 --> 00:54:13.780]   Let's talk about Twitter lists because I think it's probably the biggest single change to
[00:54:13.780 --> 00:54:17.980]   the Twitter interface since the @ sign, maybe even more important than the @ sign.
[00:54:17.980 --> 00:54:21.460]   It completely eliminates the power of the suggested users list.
[00:54:21.460 --> 00:54:26.540]   It puts that power into the hands of everybody, of users.
[00:54:26.540 --> 00:54:34.380]   Just like saying, replacing one nuclear bomb with 10,000 AK-47s takes the power away from
[00:54:34.380 --> 00:54:35.380]   the nuclear bomb.
[00:54:35.380 --> 00:54:40.180]   You can do a lot with AK-47s, but it's still not going to have the same impact.
[00:54:40.180 --> 00:54:43.780]   But they get rid of the suggested user list because they should.
[00:54:43.780 --> 00:54:46.540]   Well, I think that's what Eve said this week.
[00:54:46.540 --> 00:54:48.540]   He realizes, Junkie, that it was a mistake.
[00:54:48.540 --> 00:54:49.540]   I think.
[00:54:49.540 --> 00:54:50.540]   Right.
[00:54:50.540 --> 00:54:54.500]   But this is just a new way to present the cool kids list, I think.
[00:54:54.500 --> 00:54:55.500]   It's definitely useful.
[00:54:55.500 --> 00:54:56.500]   It's useful.
[00:54:56.500 --> 00:54:57.500]   But who presents it?
[00:54:57.500 --> 00:54:58.500]   You do.
[00:54:58.500 --> 00:54:59.500]   You do.
[00:54:59.500 --> 00:55:00.500]   So it's who you say is cool.
[00:55:00.500 --> 00:55:02.580]   And I think that's much more valuable than somebody, some faceless person at Twitter.
[00:55:02.580 --> 00:55:03.580]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:55:03.580 --> 00:55:06.060]   You're going to get much more engaged followers rather than--
[00:55:06.060 --> 00:55:07.060]   Have you made lists yet?
[00:55:07.060 --> 00:55:08.060]   I have made lists.
[00:55:08.060 --> 00:55:09.060]   I got to say, I didn't like--
[00:55:09.060 --> 00:55:10.060]   It's hard to do.
[00:55:10.060 --> 00:55:13.980]   --as a lot of people that way because no one is completely mutually exclusive in any
[00:55:13.980 --> 00:55:14.980]   of those lists.
[00:55:14.980 --> 00:55:17.140]   Well, some people are decidedly not my family.
[00:55:17.140 --> 00:55:18.700]   So everybody has lists now.
[00:55:18.700 --> 00:55:19.700]   Right.
[00:55:19.700 --> 00:55:20.700]   So I think to concede.
[00:55:20.700 --> 00:55:25.100]   So you've got news organizations, interesting, influencing friends, companies, colleagues,
[00:55:25.100 --> 00:55:26.100]   and others.
[00:55:26.100 --> 00:55:29.380]   See, at first you look at this and you think, oh, this is for me.
[00:55:29.380 --> 00:55:31.460]   This is an organizational feature for me, but it isn't.
[00:55:31.460 --> 00:55:32.460]   Right.
[00:55:32.460 --> 00:55:33.660]   I mean, you could use it that way.
[00:55:33.660 --> 00:55:38.220]   I sort of use it for me, but there's not a client that's going to filter just those
[00:55:38.220 --> 00:55:39.220]   lists yet.
[00:55:39.220 --> 00:55:40.860]   I mean, I can use it.
[00:55:40.860 --> 00:55:41.860]   Well, you can.
[00:55:41.860 --> 00:55:43.420]   You can click it and you'll see everybody who's on that.
[00:55:43.420 --> 00:55:45.580]   That now is a stream of just those people.
[00:55:45.580 --> 00:55:46.580]   Right.
[00:55:46.580 --> 00:55:47.580]   So that you can.
[00:55:47.580 --> 00:55:48.580]   You're right.
[00:55:48.580 --> 00:55:49.580]   No third party clients do it, but Twitter does it.
[00:55:49.580 --> 00:55:50.580]   They will, I'm sure.
[00:55:50.580 --> 00:55:51.580]   They won't do it.
[00:55:51.580 --> 00:55:52.580]   They will very soon.
[00:55:52.580 --> 00:55:55.060]   Have you made lists, Patrick?
[00:55:55.060 --> 00:55:56.060]   Not quite yet.
[00:55:56.060 --> 00:56:00.740]   I'm still trying to decide if this is more of a search engine tool than any search promote
[00:56:00.740 --> 00:56:01.740]   rankings and distribution.
[00:56:01.740 --> 00:56:02.740]   It is.
[00:56:02.740 --> 00:56:03.740]   Search engines more than anything else.
[00:56:03.740 --> 00:56:05.060]   I think it's exactly that.
[00:56:05.060 --> 00:56:06.940]   I think what it is is authority.
[00:56:06.940 --> 00:56:10.460]   It's giving it's a way of ranking authority.
[00:56:10.460 --> 00:56:15.820]   So for instance, now it shows that Patrick Norton is on 1,253 lists.
[00:56:15.820 --> 00:56:18.940]   That is a number of value, right?
[00:56:18.940 --> 00:56:21.300]   That says Patrick is valued by that many people.
[00:56:21.300 --> 00:56:22.500]   I think this is the new number.
[00:56:22.500 --> 00:56:23.500]   Forget followers.
[00:56:23.500 --> 00:56:25.500]   So it's $5 to tweet me now.
[00:56:25.500 --> 00:56:28.740]   It's the way that people name you on your list.
[00:56:28.740 --> 00:56:33.900]   Like all of the lists that people put me on are geek, tech, nerd.
[00:56:33.900 --> 00:56:35.900]   What did you want to be?
[00:56:35.900 --> 00:56:38.420]   Well, no, I think I'm happy with those lists.
[00:56:38.420 --> 00:56:39.420]   You can.
[00:56:39.420 --> 00:56:41.420]   That's the other thing that I think that helps me.
[00:56:41.420 --> 00:56:42.420]   It helps me identify.
[00:56:42.420 --> 00:56:48.500]   They did very, I think intelligently is you can see the who's lists you're on.
[00:56:48.500 --> 00:56:53.700]   So if you go to click the listed thing, this is all the people who your tech tweets, tech
[00:56:53.700 --> 00:56:56.340]   tweeters, most influential in tech, geek tech.
[00:56:56.340 --> 00:56:58.460]   Yeah, interesting people.
[00:56:58.460 --> 00:57:03.700]   And you can see also how many people are following those, which I think is very interesting.
[00:57:03.700 --> 00:57:06.060]   What do you think, Jason?
[00:57:06.060 --> 00:57:10.700]   It's a big deal because you can tell somebody's authority and you can tell who the spammers
[00:57:10.700 --> 00:57:17.460]   are instantly because if you appear on X number of lists and those lists are followed by X
[00:57:17.460 --> 00:57:22.340]   number of people past a certain standard deviation or whatever, you're either extremely popular
[00:57:22.340 --> 00:57:26.700]   or your non-existent person, possibly a spammer.
[00:57:26.700 --> 00:57:30.300]   So when you do a search, they could easily say by authority and-
[00:57:30.300 --> 00:57:31.300]   Well, that's interesting.
[00:57:31.300 --> 00:57:33.500]   Your right spammers are going to be on that list, are they?
[00:57:33.500 --> 00:57:34.500]   Right.
[00:57:34.500 --> 00:57:37.300]   I mean, so spammers will try to create lists of other spammers, but nobody's going to follow
[00:57:37.300 --> 00:57:39.900]   those lists except other spammers and fake accounts.
[00:57:39.900 --> 00:57:43.740]   So now they can immediately do a cut off and imagine you do a search.
[00:57:43.740 --> 00:57:48.460]   You do a search for Yankees and I say, you know what, I just want to- I do a search for
[00:57:48.460 --> 00:57:52.620]   the new Android phone and I move it over to authority and only people who appear on more
[00:57:52.620 --> 00:57:57.300]   than 100 lists that have over 10 people following each list, do I see?
[00:57:57.300 --> 00:58:00.220]   And now I can start to see really these are the interesting people, whatever.
[00:58:00.220 --> 00:58:03.860]   I mean, that's going to sound obnoxious, but these are the more authoritative figures.
[00:58:03.860 --> 00:58:04.860]   Right.
[00:58:04.860 --> 00:58:08.420]   And I think behaviorally, this is really helpful because a lot of times I'll wake up in the
[00:58:08.420 --> 00:58:12.420]   morning and only read 20 tweets back and then I'm like, I don't care to catch up.
[00:58:12.420 --> 00:58:14.460]   I'm just not going to do that.
[00:58:14.460 --> 00:58:17.260]   There's an interesting term coined by David Levy.
[00:58:17.260 --> 00:58:21.260]   He's a professor at the University of Washington called information environmentalism.
[00:58:21.260 --> 00:58:26.660]   It's the way that we filter out all the noise to get to what we really want.
[00:58:26.660 --> 00:58:30.940]   And a lot of times I think maybe there won't ever be a technology to help us with that
[00:58:30.940 --> 00:58:35.340]   beyond an RSS reader or a Twitter list, but it does seem that technology is becoming
[00:58:35.340 --> 00:58:39.860]   more keen at giving us the information that we want to know in certain informational subsets.
[00:58:39.860 --> 00:58:42.260]   And it's with the help of humans.
[00:58:42.260 --> 00:58:43.980]   I think that's the key to it.
[00:58:43.980 --> 00:58:44.980]   Yeah.
[00:58:44.980 --> 00:58:47.700]   That's one of the things that it's been coming out in some of the conferences around online
[00:58:47.700 --> 00:58:55.900]   video distribution is that in some ways the evolving thing is edited collections of video
[00:58:55.900 --> 00:58:58.340]   rather than pure random collections like YouTube.
[00:58:58.340 --> 00:59:04.700]   Or something that's pretty obvious from people who follow YouTube traffic is that the cultivated
[00:59:04.700 --> 00:59:10.220]   pages or the posted pages or the home pages all tend to generate more traffic than somebody
[00:59:10.220 --> 00:59:14.340]   stumbling across your video and the giant collection of a billion videos that are floating
[00:59:14.340 --> 00:59:15.340]   around out there.
[00:59:15.340 --> 00:59:17.140]   It's kind of interesting to watch it swing back.
[00:59:17.140 --> 00:59:21.060]   The pendulum kind of swings back and forth.
[00:59:21.060 --> 00:59:22.060]   Yeah.
[00:59:22.060 --> 00:59:24.140]   Twitter, as usual, AB to bring.
[00:59:24.140 --> 00:59:25.140]   No, it's not you.
[00:59:25.140 --> 00:59:26.140]   It's Twitter.
[00:59:26.140 --> 00:59:28.700]   But it just sucks the air right out of the room every single time.
[00:59:28.700 --> 00:59:30.380]   I don't know why we still bring it up.
[00:59:30.380 --> 00:59:31.380]   Here's a good story.
[00:59:31.380 --> 00:59:33.060]   Google Voice.
[00:59:33.060 --> 00:59:40.180]   Google made a PDF that it sent to the FCC in response to the FCC action, but they did
[00:59:40.180 --> 00:59:42.100]   it wrong.
[00:59:42.100 --> 00:59:47.300]   And people were able to read the PDF submitted to the Federal Communications Commission was
[00:59:47.300 --> 00:59:48.740]   improperly formatted.
[00:59:48.740 --> 00:59:52.300]   So people were able to read the redacted information.
[00:59:52.300 --> 00:59:54.220]   Oh, I love when people do that.
[00:59:54.220 --> 00:59:55.220]   Oh, I love it.
[00:59:55.220 --> 00:59:56.220]   And so we now know.
[00:59:56.220 --> 00:59:58.580]   Do you have a Microsoft Word and hidden columns in a SAP?
[00:59:58.580 --> 00:59:59.580]   Yes.
[00:59:59.580 --> 01:00:00.580]   Genius.
[01:00:00.580 --> 01:00:01.580]   Yep.
[01:00:01.580 --> 01:00:03.380]   Several things about Google Voice we didn't know before.
[01:00:03.380 --> 01:00:07.380]   Business Week's reporting that Google Voice now has 1.4 million users.
[01:00:07.380 --> 01:00:09.180]   This is still not a public service.
[01:00:09.180 --> 01:00:10.180]   Wow.
[01:00:10.180 --> 01:00:11.180]   That's significant.
[01:00:11.180 --> 01:00:15.420]   40% of whom, half a million, use the service every day.
[01:00:15.420 --> 01:00:17.220]   I'll include myself in that number.
[01:00:17.220 --> 01:00:19.220]   Yeah, I use it.
[01:00:19.220 --> 01:00:23.900]   Google, also in the redacted section, suggests that Google intends to take its voice service
[01:00:23.900 --> 01:00:27.420]   global as Link deals with international service providers.
[01:00:27.420 --> 01:00:29.380]   Of course, they're not doing that yet.
[01:00:29.380 --> 01:00:31.260]   You have to be in the US to use it.
[01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:36.980]   It's pretty amazing that they screwed up the formatting of the PDF.
[01:00:36.980 --> 01:00:38.980]   You use Google Voice, Patrick?
[01:00:38.980 --> 01:00:39.980]   No, I'm--
[01:00:39.980 --> 01:00:40.980]   I'll send an invite.
[01:00:40.980 --> 01:00:42.980]   No, it's one or so.
[01:00:42.980 --> 01:00:46.620]   It's a need for an invite.
[01:00:46.620 --> 01:00:51.260]   Anything that involves comms, I just use my iPhone and I don't jailbreak my iPhone.
[01:00:51.260 --> 01:00:52.420]   I should try it, but it's just not like--
[01:00:52.420 --> 01:00:53.420]   You don't need a jailbreak.
[01:00:53.420 --> 01:00:56.260]   You can use it without jailbreaking anything.
[01:00:56.260 --> 01:00:57.260]   No, no, no, no, no.
[01:00:57.260 --> 01:00:58.260]   I know that.
[01:00:58.260 --> 01:01:00.940]   I guess what I'm saying is like it's the one thing that I want--
[01:01:00.940 --> 01:01:02.940]   I want to make sure calls always--
[01:01:02.940 --> 01:01:04.100]   It's reliable, I understand.
[01:01:04.100 --> 01:01:05.100]   Yeah.
[01:01:05.100 --> 01:01:06.100]   I've--
[01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:09.060]   Oh, yeah, and the iPhone is so reliable, don't you find?
[01:01:09.060 --> 01:01:10.860]   Don't even get me started.
[01:01:10.860 --> 01:01:18.420]   If it wasn't for 850 megahertz, the 850 megahertz roll out literally, I was shopping around
[01:01:18.420 --> 01:01:21.500]   and flipping coins to decide which of the other networks to go with.
[01:01:21.500 --> 01:01:27.380]   And I went from not being able to hold a call for five minutes to actually being able
[01:01:27.380 --> 01:01:31.540]   to hold calls in parts of the city that I've never actually had connectivity before.
[01:01:31.540 --> 01:01:36.540]   So I can't-- AT&T can't roll out that nationwide fast enough.
[01:01:36.540 --> 01:01:40.260]   You using Google Voice, Mr. Calicanis?
[01:01:40.260 --> 01:01:45.460]   I signed up for it and I'm not currently using it because it was a weird phone number
[01:01:45.460 --> 01:01:47.460]   and I guess I got a four in my home to it.
[01:01:47.460 --> 01:01:48.460]   But you can get your phone number.
[01:01:48.460 --> 01:01:50.620]   They've added number portability, so.
[01:01:50.620 --> 01:01:53.860]   Yeah, I'm going to think about doing that, but right now I have the simulscribe, which
[01:01:53.860 --> 01:01:54.860]   is a human being--
[01:01:54.860 --> 01:01:55.860]   Oh, yeah.
[01:01:55.860 --> 01:01:56.860]   We've been using that.
[01:01:56.860 --> 01:01:59.180]   And they're the phone type folks.
[01:01:59.180 --> 01:02:01.140]   That works really, really well.
[01:02:01.140 --> 01:02:04.740]   They send your phone message to the Philippines, Manila.
[01:02:04.740 --> 01:02:05.740]   Somebody writes it down.
[01:02:05.740 --> 01:02:08.300]   And somebody writes it so compared to the translate they have.
[01:02:08.300 --> 01:02:11.980]   And I need this because I don't like picking up my phone because I get a range of phone
[01:02:11.980 --> 01:02:13.980]   calls and my number is out there.
[01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:17.380]   And it's great because I'll get something, somebody's pitching me on a technology.
[01:02:17.380 --> 01:02:18.980]   I forward it to my CTO.
[01:02:18.980 --> 01:02:22.620]   They set us up with a phone number for a Mac break weekly we've been using it.
[01:02:22.620 --> 01:02:24.700]   It's always, they're very accurate transcriptions.
[01:02:24.700 --> 01:02:25.700]   Unlike Google Voice.
[01:02:25.700 --> 01:02:27.700]   Isn't it horrible, Natalie?
[01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:29.580]   I've been called Bradley.
[01:02:29.580 --> 01:02:32.820]   I'm surprised they got it at a close at all.
[01:02:32.820 --> 01:02:36.420]   Madeleine, dad, because someone calls me Nat.
[01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:38.580]   Cat, let's see, what else?
[01:02:38.580 --> 01:02:39.580]   Yeah, every name but Natalie.
[01:02:39.580 --> 01:02:40.580]   Somebody called you Fat.
[01:02:40.580 --> 01:02:41.580]   I mean, that was the end of it.
[01:02:41.580 --> 01:02:42.580]   Yeah, hey, Fat.
[01:02:42.580 --> 01:02:43.580]   And then I had to meet for me.
[01:02:43.580 --> 01:02:44.580]   This message is for Fat.
[01:02:44.580 --> 01:02:48.780]   It's a great game to go to your Google Voice account and look at the text.
[01:02:48.780 --> 01:02:53.220]   Let me see if I can do this without giving out anybody's phone number.
[01:02:53.220 --> 01:02:54.220]   So my--
[01:02:54.220 --> 01:02:55.220]   Don't do it, Leo.
[01:02:55.220 --> 01:02:56.580]   My sister, I know, I can't.
[01:02:56.580 --> 01:02:59.220]   I'm zooming in as best I can, but there's no way I can do it.
[01:02:59.220 --> 01:03:00.780]   Do you have jobs as iPhone?
[01:03:00.780 --> 01:03:01.780]   What?
[01:03:01.780 --> 01:03:03.620]   My sister calls, Hi Maria.
[01:03:03.620 --> 01:03:06.620]   Okay, that's not my name, obviously.
[01:03:06.620 --> 01:03:08.460]   And I think my sister knows that.
[01:03:08.460 --> 01:03:12.660]   With even I know you're very busy and I just want to know if you want to do fees sometime
[01:03:12.660 --> 01:03:16.380]   this week or you think that Dan should do it, I don't know what she's talking about.
[01:03:16.380 --> 01:03:18.380]   You probably shouldn't be fusing with her.
[01:03:18.380 --> 01:03:19.700]   Yeah, I'm fusing with her.
[01:03:19.700 --> 01:03:20.700]   It's pretty funny.
[01:03:20.700 --> 01:03:22.580]   I mean, some of these are just hysterical.
[01:03:22.580 --> 01:03:23.660]   And yet there's enough there.
[01:03:23.660 --> 01:03:25.540]   It's really a game to figure out what they're talking about.
[01:03:25.540 --> 01:03:26.540]   There's enough there that you can figure out.
[01:03:26.540 --> 01:03:29.660]   Just what I want when I'm working with delicate and important communications.
[01:03:29.660 --> 01:03:33.820]   It's like that cell phone moment where you're in the critical moment in the conversation
[01:03:33.820 --> 01:03:39.180]   with the girlfriend or boyfriend or soon to be ex or spouse or soon to be ex-spouse where
[01:03:39.180 --> 01:03:40.180]   the phone cuts out.
[01:03:40.180 --> 01:03:42.380]   You call them back and they're even more pissed off.
[01:03:42.380 --> 01:03:46.020]   Well, there is a feature on Google Voice that I like, but confuse my wife no end.
[01:03:46.020 --> 01:03:50.420]   You can-- you have your contacts and you can have a different outbound message for every
[01:03:50.420 --> 01:03:51.420]   contact.
[01:03:51.420 --> 01:03:53.540]   So I have friends, I have family.
[01:03:53.540 --> 01:03:56.220]   In the family message, it says, "Love you.
[01:03:56.220 --> 01:03:57.220]   Bye."
[01:03:57.220 --> 01:03:59.860]   Because it's only going to my kids and my wife.
[01:03:59.860 --> 01:04:01.460]   But my wife calls, gets this message.
[01:04:01.460 --> 01:04:04.660]   She says, "Do you tell everybody who leaves a message with you that you love them?"
[01:04:04.660 --> 01:04:06.860]   Well, but it takes it from that number.
[01:04:06.860 --> 01:04:11.140]   So if someone else calls you from your home phone, they're going to get that love you
[01:04:11.140 --> 01:04:12.140]   message.
[01:04:12.140 --> 01:04:13.140]   Oh.
[01:04:13.140 --> 01:04:14.140]   Because--
[01:04:14.140 --> 01:04:15.140]   I didn't think it's that.
[01:04:15.140 --> 01:04:16.140]   You're right.
[01:04:16.140 --> 01:04:17.140]   It's number.
[01:04:17.140 --> 01:04:18.140]   And it doesn't let you try again.
[01:04:18.140 --> 01:04:19.660]   There are people who will call me.
[01:04:19.660 --> 01:04:24.540]   And it'll say, at the tone, say your name and Google Voice will try and reach out.
[01:04:24.540 --> 01:04:25.540]   And then there's that tone.
[01:04:25.540 --> 01:04:27.260]   And people are like, "What the heck is this?"
[01:04:27.260 --> 01:04:28.980]   I get a lot of those.
[01:04:28.980 --> 01:04:29.980]   And then click.
[01:04:29.980 --> 01:04:32.300]   And then you pick up and it says, "Will you take a call from?"
[01:04:32.300 --> 01:04:34.180]   What the heck is this?
[01:04:34.180 --> 01:04:36.100]   And then that person's like, "Oh, I didn't understand it."
[01:04:36.100 --> 01:04:37.460]   And then that person calls again.
[01:04:37.460 --> 01:04:40.220]   They never get to do that again from that phone number.
[01:04:40.220 --> 01:04:43.380]   So every time that person calls, I get a call from--
[01:04:43.380 --> 01:04:44.380]   What the heck?
[01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:45.380]   What the heck?
[01:04:45.380 --> 01:04:50.140]   I'll not call you from your home number because--
[01:04:50.140 --> 01:04:51.140]   That's good.
[01:04:51.140 --> 01:04:52.140]   Again, the lawyer thing.
[01:04:52.140 --> 01:04:53.140]   Love you.
[01:04:53.140 --> 01:04:54.140]   Love you.
[01:04:54.140 --> 01:04:55.140]   Call me anytime.
[01:04:55.140 --> 01:05:01.140]   The big picture is that now with FIS product and with Gmail and with Calendar, this is going
[01:05:01.140 --> 01:05:05.980]   to be their leverage to get you to get one login and all of a sudden all your information
[01:05:05.980 --> 01:05:06.980]   is on your phone.
[01:05:06.980 --> 01:05:07.980]   You're done synchronizing the cloud.
[01:05:07.980 --> 01:05:11.460]   Well, it did that with the pre, but of course it does it with the Android phones.
[01:05:11.460 --> 01:05:12.460]   It does it with the Android.
[01:05:12.460 --> 01:05:14.580]   It does it with the iPhone now, too.
[01:05:14.580 --> 01:05:19.460]   So when people call me on the radio shows, I can't get my calendar to say, "I just put
[01:05:19.460 --> 01:05:21.260]   everything on Google and forget it."
[01:05:21.260 --> 01:05:22.260]   Yes.
[01:05:22.260 --> 01:05:23.260]   You said it for--
[01:05:23.260 --> 01:05:24.260]   You're a slave.
[01:05:24.260 --> 01:05:25.260]   I'm where slaves to Google.
[01:05:25.260 --> 01:05:28.220]   Hey, here's one for you, Mr. Jason Calicanas.
[01:05:28.220 --> 01:05:29.740]   You're about to talk to me.
[01:05:29.740 --> 01:05:33.140]   No, Microsoft and Yahoo delay signing search deal.
[01:05:33.140 --> 01:05:34.140]   Hello.
[01:05:34.140 --> 01:05:35.540]   Yeah, no big deal.
[01:05:35.540 --> 01:05:39.300]   It's the endless story that we thought had an end and now it doesn't.
[01:05:39.300 --> 01:05:42.980]   I told you for number one, I told Divorik this would get done.
[01:05:42.980 --> 01:05:43.980]   And he was like, "No, I just never got a secret."
[01:05:43.980 --> 01:05:44.980]   A year and a half ago.
[01:05:44.980 --> 01:05:45.980]   It has to get done.
[01:05:45.980 --> 01:05:48.220]   But Divorik's verging on accurate at this point.
[01:05:48.220 --> 01:05:50.140]   They still-- I mean, come on.
[01:05:50.140 --> 01:05:54.260]   I mean, they should-- if just to shut him up, they should do it.
[01:05:54.260 --> 01:05:55.940]   She-- because she's not done.
[01:05:55.940 --> 01:05:57.620]   Who is done, that would be done.
[01:05:57.620 --> 01:06:00.260]   Carol Bartz, we beg you.
[01:06:00.260 --> 01:06:01.780]   Just shut up, Joe and--
[01:06:01.780 --> 01:06:03.300]   Just shut up, Joe and then get signed the deal.
[01:06:03.300 --> 01:06:04.820]   Oh, that's so funny.
[01:06:04.820 --> 01:06:06.620]   No, they signed the deal.
[01:06:06.620 --> 01:06:08.420]   They rushed to do it because they wanted to--
[01:06:08.420 --> 01:06:12.020]   You know, Google needed to do this because-- I mean, Yahoo needed to do this because they
[01:06:12.020 --> 01:06:14.620]   need to save face and get their company back on track.
[01:06:14.620 --> 01:06:15.900]   I mean, their stock price has gone up.
[01:06:15.900 --> 01:06:17.700]   Action is doing this.
[01:06:17.700 --> 01:06:21.540]   And I think Carol Bartz is not a product person.
[01:06:21.540 --> 01:06:26.700]   And so I think it's a mistake to put a non-product person in charge of a company like this.
[01:06:26.700 --> 01:06:27.700]   That's just me.
[01:06:27.700 --> 01:06:30.340]   I just love her Take-A-Prisoners attitude, though.
[01:06:30.340 --> 01:06:31.620]   I do like that about her.
[01:06:31.620 --> 01:06:36.740]   So I mean, she's not a wet noodle and she has a spine and she's tough.
[01:06:36.740 --> 01:06:40.460]   So hopefully that will work out for her and she can get great product people in there.
[01:06:40.460 --> 01:06:41.860]   But man, did they screw up.
[01:06:41.860 --> 01:06:45.820]   I mean, if you think about what they could have done, they could have--
[01:06:45.820 --> 01:06:47.740]   This is what I would have done if I was CEO.
[01:06:47.740 --> 01:06:48.740]   And I mean, this is--
[01:06:48.740 --> 01:06:50.500]   But it's not over for them.
[01:06:50.500 --> 01:06:53.580]   I mean, they still have over 400 million people.
[01:06:53.580 --> 01:06:54.100]   Huge.
[01:06:54.100 --> 01:06:55.260]   Look what they did with Engadget.
[01:06:55.260 --> 01:06:57.540]   I mean, well, let's say you're well.
[01:06:57.540 --> 01:06:57.980]   Never mind.
[01:06:57.980 --> 01:06:58.340]   Let's say you're well.
[01:06:58.340 --> 01:07:00.140]   But anyway.
[01:07:00.140 --> 01:07:02.100]   Haven't in the glass of wine, Leo.
[01:07:02.100 --> 01:07:02.980]   Yeah.
[01:07:02.980 --> 01:07:07.300]   Anyway, they can still do great things if they had product people.
[01:07:07.300 --> 01:07:10.300]   But I mean, if you think about the moment in time a couple of years ago when they had
[01:07:10.300 --> 01:07:14.620]   Katarina from Flickr and Josh from Delicious there, I mean, they had some of the best
[01:07:14.620 --> 01:07:16.060]   brains in the world.
[01:07:16.060 --> 01:07:21.420]   And they didn't embrace them and use them to build great product.
[01:07:21.420 --> 01:07:24.340]   And they still haven't monetized either product, have they?
[01:07:24.340 --> 01:07:24.860]   No.
[01:07:24.860 --> 01:07:27.780]   Well, I mean, and both those products are still the most loved--
[01:07:27.780 --> 01:07:30.220]   some of the most loved Yahoo products.
[01:07:30.220 --> 01:07:31.220]   No doubt.
[01:07:31.220 --> 01:07:36.140]   I'm just saying, like, you know, being soil-inspiry, like, and are they ever going to monetize these?
[01:07:36.140 --> 01:07:37.140]   They've got this traffic.
[01:07:37.140 --> 01:07:38.180]   They have this community.
[01:07:38.180 --> 01:07:39.260]   Everybody's invested.
[01:07:39.260 --> 01:07:40.260]   Everybody lives on it.
[01:07:40.260 --> 01:07:41.900]   And it's like--
[01:07:41.900 --> 01:07:44.860]   Yeah, but imagine they properly motivate those two individuals.
[01:07:44.860 --> 01:07:48.940]   And if you said to Katarina, like, OK, you know what you do with images.
[01:07:48.940 --> 01:07:50.340]   Do it again with video.
[01:07:50.340 --> 01:07:51.420]   Do it again with blogs.
[01:07:51.420 --> 01:07:51.420]   Yeah.
[01:07:51.420 --> 01:07:55.540]   And Josh Chachter, I'd say, Josh, listen, look at the search and do something huge with search.
[01:07:55.540 --> 01:07:57.620]   And get them involved.
[01:07:57.620 --> 01:07:58.460]   And you know what?
[01:07:58.460 --> 01:08:00.860]   They just-- they had all these great assets there, and they didn't leverage it.
[01:08:00.860 --> 01:08:04.700]   So maybe, you know, because she's such a strong leader, and she's got the company going
[01:08:04.700 --> 01:08:08.180]   the right direction, and she has the support of the board, and she has a currency that's
[01:08:08.180 --> 01:08:12.180]   worth a lot of money, she can go invest or buy a lot of the great companies out there.
[01:08:12.180 --> 01:08:13.580]   Go buy dig.
[01:08:13.580 --> 01:08:14.580]   Go buy it.
[01:08:14.580 --> 01:08:18.060]   And let Kevin Rose work on some of these products and make him chief product officer.
[01:08:18.060 --> 01:08:20.940]   That's the kind of bold thing they need to do.
[01:08:20.940 --> 01:08:23.620]   And maybe she's the type of person who's not going to sit there and go, what?
[01:08:23.620 --> 01:08:25.860]   We're going to put Kevin Rose in charge or whatever?
[01:08:25.860 --> 01:08:26.860]   You know what?
[01:08:26.860 --> 01:08:28.580]   You know, but that's how they think people are.
[01:08:28.580 --> 01:08:29.580]   Do they have the cash now?
[01:08:29.580 --> 01:08:30.820]   Are they in a good enough cash position?
[01:08:30.820 --> 01:08:32.780]   They could go on a buying spree.
[01:08:32.780 --> 01:08:34.180]   They have stock even better.
[01:08:34.180 --> 01:08:36.500]   You know, you just-- you know, stock and cash.
[01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:37.500]   Undervalued stock.
[01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:38.500]   Exactly.
[01:08:38.500 --> 01:08:40.380]   That stock could be worth more.
[01:08:40.380 --> 01:08:43.620]   So you know, at AOL's coming into the market, so what you're going to see when AOL goes
[01:08:43.620 --> 01:08:51.300]   public in December, January timeframe, you're going to have Yahoo, Google, Microsoft, and
[01:08:51.300 --> 01:08:54.020]   AOL are going to go on a buying frenzy.
[01:08:54.020 --> 01:08:57.300]   And all the startups that you love now that are independent companies, you're going to
[01:08:57.300 --> 01:08:59.100]   start seeing them get bought up real quick.
[01:08:59.100 --> 01:09:01.980]   And Facebook will be going public in 20 months.
[01:09:01.980 --> 01:09:06.700]   And when they go public, and Zing is going to go public, you're going to see massive, massive
[01:09:06.700 --> 01:09:12.300]   amounts of acquisitions and, you know, the third age of the web.
[01:09:12.300 --> 01:09:15.740]   Devorex says it's Sarbanes Oxley that's keeping these companies from going public.
[01:09:15.740 --> 01:09:17.780]   Is that the case?
[01:09:17.780 --> 01:09:21.740]   There is little-- yes, there's a little upside to going public early now because you can
[01:09:21.740 --> 01:09:23.140]   get cash from other places.
[01:09:23.140 --> 01:09:27.660]   Remember, people used to raise 20 million, 30 million, 40 million, 50 million, 100 million
[01:09:27.660 --> 01:09:28.660]   in IPO.
[01:09:28.660 --> 01:09:30.220]   Well, what did Twitter just raise?
[01:09:30.220 --> 01:09:31.220]   100 million.
[01:09:31.220 --> 01:09:32.220]   100 million.
[01:09:32.220 --> 01:09:33.220]   Yeah.
[01:09:33.220 --> 01:09:34.220]   That's IPO level money.
[01:09:34.220 --> 01:09:36.300]   It's a little above 25, 30 million dollars.
[01:09:36.300 --> 01:09:37.300]   That's IP.
[01:09:37.300 --> 01:09:38.300]   I raised 20 million from all.
[01:09:38.300 --> 01:09:39.300]   Oh, you don't need to IPO now.
[01:09:39.300 --> 01:09:40.940]   There's plenty of sources where you can do it.
[01:09:40.940 --> 01:09:41.940]   And guess what?
[01:09:41.940 --> 01:09:44.060]   Bloomberg's got a company that's worth billions of dollars.
[01:09:44.060 --> 01:09:45.060]   That's private.
[01:09:45.060 --> 01:09:46.220]   It's okay to be private.
[01:09:46.220 --> 01:09:49.740]   It's okay to be a liquid if there is M&A activity going on.
[01:09:49.740 --> 01:09:51.460]   The companies are worth a lot of money.
[01:09:51.460 --> 01:09:55.900]   But that being said, these companies are getting too big with too much revenue to not
[01:09:55.900 --> 01:09:56.900]   do it.
[01:09:56.900 --> 01:09:57.900]   So Facebook and--
[01:09:57.900 --> 01:09:58.940]   They have to spend, say.
[01:09:58.940 --> 01:10:02.860]   And Zinga, those three companies, Facebook, Twitter, and Zinga will be public.
[01:10:02.860 --> 01:10:06.180]   And they're going to be the next Yahoo Google Microsofts.
[01:10:06.180 --> 01:10:07.180]   I understand.
[01:10:07.180 --> 01:10:10.620]   Why do they have to go public?
[01:10:10.620 --> 01:10:17.060]   Because when they have that currency stock, you can do a lot of interesting things.
[01:10:17.060 --> 01:10:18.980]   You can get a lot of capital and you can acquire things.
[01:10:18.980 --> 01:10:22.940]   But unless the stock is freely traded, it's not currency.
[01:10:22.940 --> 01:10:23.940]   Yes.
[01:10:23.940 --> 01:10:25.460]   And so you think about employees.
[01:10:25.460 --> 01:10:29.980]   If you have these employees and they can't sell their stock at Facebook and they're getting
[01:10:29.980 --> 01:10:33.980]   tired and they want money and, okay, I've been at Facebook now for three, four, five
[01:10:33.980 --> 01:10:37.620]   years and I was supposed to be able to buy a house on a car at some point.
[01:10:37.620 --> 01:10:38.620]   You know--
[01:10:38.620 --> 01:10:39.620]   Got it.
[01:10:39.620 --> 01:10:40.620]   It gets a little tired.
[01:10:40.620 --> 01:10:41.620]   You can't hire.
[01:10:41.620 --> 01:10:43.620]   What if they just pay them well and give them good?
[01:10:43.620 --> 01:10:44.620]   I'm just saying.
[01:10:44.620 --> 01:10:46.860]   No, no, that'll never work.
[01:10:46.860 --> 01:10:47.860]   That'll never work.
[01:10:47.860 --> 01:10:52.940]   I mean, Google pays extremely well, but people were there for the stock options.
[01:10:52.940 --> 01:10:56.460]   And the major run-up, when you get-- you can get people to work 50 hours a week, 60
[01:10:56.460 --> 01:10:58.460]   hours a week with cash.
[01:10:58.460 --> 01:10:59.460]   I thought it was just--
[01:10:59.460 --> 01:11:00.460]   I thought it was just--
[01:11:00.460 --> 01:11:01.460]   I thought it was just--
[01:11:01.460 --> 01:11:02.460]   I thought it was just--
[01:11:02.460 --> 01:11:03.460]   I thought it was just--
[01:11:03.460 --> 01:11:04.460]   I thought it was just--
[01:11:04.460 --> 01:11:05.460]   I thought it was just--
[01:11:05.460 --> 01:11:06.460]   I thought it was just--
[01:11:06.460 --> 01:11:07.460]   It was just--
[01:11:07.460 --> 01:11:08.460]   It was just--
[01:11:08.460 --> 01:11:09.460]   I thought it was just--
[01:11:09.460 --> 01:11:10.460]   I thought it was just--
[01:11:10.460 --> 01:11:11.460]   It was just--
[01:11:11.460 --> 01:11:12.460]   I thought it was just--
[01:11:12.460 --> 01:11:13.460]   It was just--
[01:11:13.460 --> 01:11:14.460]   It was just--
[01:11:14.460 --> 01:11:15.460]   It was just--
[01:11:15.460 --> 01:11:16.460]   It was just--
[01:11:16.460 --> 01:11:17.460]   I thought it was just--
[01:11:17.460 --> 01:11:18.460]   It was just--
[01:11:18.460 --> 01:11:19.460]   It was just--
[01:11:19.460 --> 01:11:20.460]   It was just--
[01:11:20.460 --> 01:11:21.460]   It was just--
[01:11:21.460 --> 01:11:22.460]   It was just--
[01:11:22.460 --> 01:11:23.460]   It was just--
[01:11:23.460 --> 01:11:24.460]   It was just--
[01:11:24.460 --> 01:11:25.460]   It was just--
[01:11:25.460 --> 01:11:26.460]   It was just--
[01:11:26.460 --> 01:11:27.460]   It was just--
[01:11:27.460 --> 01:11:28.460]   It was just--
[01:11:28.460 --> 01:11:29.460]   It was just--
