[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   This is Twit, Episode 42, February 19, 2006.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   [Music]
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   Life, answer to life, universe, and everything.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to Twit.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   After a hiatus, a brief calm.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   We are back in the storm and with some new face,
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   actually, a new face joining us.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   Let's introduce him right now from cnet.com.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   What is your title?
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   - Editor. - Yeah.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   - Tom Merritt. - He used to be an executive editor
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   for the website for TechTV. - Yep.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   - And of course, his site Subbrilliant lives on Subbrilliant.com.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   - Yep. - You do stuff there?
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   - Yeah, I just relaunched it at the end of the summer,
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   which means I worked on it for the first time in two years.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   - I really liked it. - That's good.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   I had it a post.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   We're relaunching.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   Tom, actually, we're reciprocating.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   Tom was very kind to invite me to be on his podcast with CNET.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   - Buzz out loud. - Buzz out loud.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   Yeah, Molly Wood, Veronica Belmont.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   - Really great. - Yeah, we have fun.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   - You never said Veronica's last name, so I never --
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   - That's that one. - Veronica the producer.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   - We just call her producer Veronica, yeah.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   - Producer Veronica.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   And also from DLTV, we've got Robert Heron here.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   It's great to see you again, Robert.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   - Good to see you, too.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   - Thank you for showing up last week.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   - Hey.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   - Didn't do it to it last week.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   I had Robert and Woz on the line, and nobody else showed up.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   - Well, I was half there.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   I was dealing with my cable subscription from my modem.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   - Did you get your upgrade?
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   - I did, but I'm pretty disappointed with it, so.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   - Oh, no.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   - I'm going to probably cancel it and drop back to the standard.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   - It was all excited because my podcast was going to give me eight minutes.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   - I was. - I was going to give them eight minutes.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   - I was. - For a couple of days.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   - What happened?
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   - They're just not delivering the speed.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   - I can find, if they can provide one example of an eight megabit connection.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   - That's the.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   - Anywhere.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   - There's nobody up there.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   - There's nobody up there.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   - Testing, I've been trying to download multiple, I guess, solid four megabit.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   - I've seen it.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   - I've seen it peak above six once.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   - That's it.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   - And I've never even seen it made.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   But they did the double upload speed.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   That went down solid.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   - You were getting four on what system?
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   - On Comcast.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   - No, before.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   - Oh, you paid more for it faster speed on Comcast?
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   - Yeah, basically, I want to double my download speed and double my upload speed for another ten bucks a month.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   It's kind of half there.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   So they didn't, okay.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   - And I don't think it's going to get any faster.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   - I'm screwed, dude.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   - I'm just going to say, you know what, give me my ten bucks a month.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   - I don't think anybody in this room should be giving anybody to Comcast, of all people.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   It's convenient.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   - What else are you going to do?
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   - My TV in my minutes.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   - What other monopolist are you going to give it to?
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   - Do you have any choice?
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   No, you're right.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   - If I can, if I can, I don't have a phone line in my house.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   There's a phone line there, but I don't have to have a phone account to get DSL.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   - Okay.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   - Am I out employed?
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   - Roger Chang?
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   - Yes.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   - Welcome back, Roger.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   You got a job, since we saw you last?
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   - Yeah, I just started Wednesday.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   - He's more fun if he's unemployed.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   - No, he's hangdog no matter what.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   He'll hate this job in a few.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   - Hey, who hired you?
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   - Yes.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   Starts with the initials or PN.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   - Mr. Norton hired you.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   So you're working for DLTV?
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   - Yes.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   - Is this a full-time gig?
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   - Yes.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   - And Jim Latterback and the gang over there.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   - You're hanging your boss yet?
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   - No.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   - Hey, what is, you know, you know, I was actually talking to Tom about this.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   I was in a job that I've actually went out and looked and got myself.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   I ended up hating.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   - Is that true, really?
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   - In every other job that people either offered or say, "Hey, there's an opening.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   Why don't you go apply?"
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   You know?
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   - So when people throw jobs at you, you like it.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   - Yeah, but if I actively go seek and find one, then it's going to suck.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   - Wow.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   - So you basically have no taste.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   - Maybe.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   - Yeah.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   - I don't know.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   I mean, I may be more inspired.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   - That's my conclusion.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   - It's a very crude way of putting it.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   - He's quite accurate.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   - It was that guy who had bad luck.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   - Rodney DeGio.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   - Rodney DeGio.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   - Oh, he's probably some of that.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   - Yeah, Roger.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   - I get no respect.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   - There was a guy.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   This is way before your time.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   It was in the little abner.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   The guy who had always had bad luck.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   - Oh, yeah, vaguely.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   You don't remember.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   - John C. Devorak is here.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   Devorak.org/blog.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   John is now officially certified.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   Insane.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   - Apparently, according to these cartoons.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   - Nitro's acting snaggy.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   Say so.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   In the Joy of Tech, I'll put a link in the show notes.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   It starts off with a doctor speaking to two people back of their heads.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   We'll soon know who those people are.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   I'm afraid the news is not good.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   Although it seemed like he was making progress lately.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   Your friend has now had a relapse.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   The severe delusions and intense psychosis of return,
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   and they are manifesting themselves in his work.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   In layman's terms, John C. Devorak has totally lost it.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   And then we turn around.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   It's Patrick and me crying.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   Devorak goes, listen to me.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   Apple computer is going to ditch the Mac OS for Microsoft.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   Windows, it's true.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   Do you hear me?
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   Apple switching the Windows.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   What were you smoking when you wrote that column?
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   - I'll tell you, if they actually do this,
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   you guys are going to be eating a lot of crow.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   - Yeah, but it ain't got to go.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   - Minimally.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   - Why would Apple switch to...
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   - Well, I got to...
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   - You said this was going to happen two weeks ago.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   We let it slide.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   - We let it slide.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   - What, the column?
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   - Yeah.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   - No, no, not just the...
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   You said you were going to write this column.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   - Well, the column was already in.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   It was ready to go.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   I thought I pre-promoted it.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   But I pulled out the original edited version.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   And I have the laundry list here.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   I mean, it's just...
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   - Okay, why?
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   - I mean, how many times...
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   I mean, you keep seeing this writing on the wall.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   I don't know that they're going to do anything.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   But it just seems to me there's too many coincidences.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   And I'll go over it.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   - I have to admit, I've been getting email from people saying,
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   "You know, when you look at all these evidence,
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   John might be right."
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   Which I think just shows you that anything can be proven true
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   if you combine enough random bags.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   - No, but this is overwhelming.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   This is one, two, three, four, right.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   - It's a beautiful mind.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   - Very good.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   Five, six, seven, eight, nine...
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   - Definitely windows.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   - Definitely windows.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   - Nine.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   I got this like...
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   - Two, two reasons.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   Definitely windows.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   - 10, 11, 12 things.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   - Tell us some of them.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   - My favorite thing, I've gotten a few emails mostly from
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   people that think I'm nuts.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   But they have to end...
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   Or these guys are the comments on the PC magazine online.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   They go, "I hate reading you and I hate...
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   And I read you and I'm not going to read you anymore."
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   I don't get what they're talking about.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   - I'll email you next week after next call.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   - But somebody's...
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   Yeah, right.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   You're still...
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   - You have a co-sell of Twit and...
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   - I was something with somebody sick, because I mentioned that
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   Apple could compete with Dell and some of these Mac people said,
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   "You know, why would they do that?
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   Why would they want to compete with the likes of Dell?"
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   As those Dell is like some...
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   - Oh, nice.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   - I'm thinking, "What do you...
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   Does this kind of..."
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   I mean, I think Apple people must have really some sort of
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   insecurity, because if they don't think they can compete with
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   the likes of Dell, those machines are homely and they're not...
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   And they're all made in China.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   - Yeah, the likes of Dell.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   - The likes of Dell.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   - I tell you.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   - Anyway, I read the column and you can read it.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   - So what's your most compelling argument?
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   What's the...
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   - Well, I think the...
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   I think that Adobe keeps putting off this issue of,
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   "We're not going to put it on the x86 yet."
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   Maybe 2007, they keep changing it.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   And it seems to me that they're just waiting for the switch
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   so they don't have to do anything.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   I mean, that's my favorite one, but the ones...
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   I'll go over all of them.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   The Apple switch adds a roll, nobody switches.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   The iPod losses firewire connector.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   The iPod was a lever...
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   According to the guy who sent me the note, the iPod was
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   originally a leveraging tool and they gave up on it.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   They switched to the Intel microprocessor, which makes it
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   pretty straightforward, despite the fact that the power PC
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   is still continuing to be developed.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   - Yeah, in fact, you're starting to look at the Power 6,
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   which is looking really good.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   - That they dropped it for a reason.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   Also, they freak out over the lawsuits over the gossip sites
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   for no good reason.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   - You think maybe they're worried the gossip sites will
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   find this out?
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   - Yeah, the pot of money from Bill Gates still unexplained.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   We don't know anything that happened about it.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   - What the pot of money?
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   - It was 150,000, 150 million.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   - 150 million.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   - It was years ago, it ran out long ago.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   - I went into this.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   (laughing)
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   - The comment at MacWorld Expo by the Microsoft spokesperson
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   that's in MS office will continue to be developed for the
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   Mac for five years.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   Why five years?
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   Why not six?
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   Why not seven?
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   Adobe and other IN apps are not being ported.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   It's all about the drivers.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   I mean, who wants to deal with this?
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   I mean, it seems to me that it's a smart thing to do.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   Dump the OS X86 and just that somebody else do all the way.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   - Send your email to the work.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   - Could the same reasons be they want to dump Unix and go to
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   free BSD or something?
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   I mean, you know what?
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   I'm hoping.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   - It's just they hold it.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   - I hope you're right.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   - It seems to be pointing to dumping software.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   - Drivers, drivers, drivers.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   - No, I--
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   - That's why nobody's gone to use--
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   - It's athletics.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   - Only advantage is that they have OS 10, but you know, I hope
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   you're right.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   - No, they got plenty of that.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   These are nice units.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   - And for a fair bit of a library to tell.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   - Yeah, but I don't think it's--
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   - Coming for a job use case.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   - Job use case, weren't they going through some financial
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   troubles too recently and they had to downsize the company and--
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   - No, what?
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   - No, Adobe.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   - Adobe.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   - In particular.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   So if you're going to focus your software into any market, you go
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   for the most profitable one.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   - There's lots.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   - Okay, well anyway.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   - That's just a--
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   - I'm not--
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   - I created a firestorm around the office today.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   - All of them came around because I got this note from this guy.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   I thought, this guy's nuts.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   And then I started thinking about it.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   And in that five year, my MS office, five year thing is what
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   triggered me writing it.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   - I think you're getting it.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.400]   - You buy away, we're getting a million page views on this
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:03.400]   baby.
[00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:04.400]   - I'm believable.
[00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:06.400]   - You're like burning the servers up.
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:07.400]   - You're probably getting more email than the time.
[00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:09.400]   - So thank you very much, Apple users.
[00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:12.400]   - You've switched to the Google OS, that's your name.
[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:14.400]   - You're probably getting more email than the time you said that
[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:16.400]   the iBook looked like a toilet.
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:18.400]   - No, actually that got the most email.
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:19.400]   - What's the woman's compact?
[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:20.400]   - The toilet seat.
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:21.400]   - The woman's compact?
[00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:23.400]   - Yeah, I had that one time I was on this girl.
[00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:24.400]   - A little girl.
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:25.400]   - And I pulled up and I pulled out a--
[00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:26.400]   (laughter)
[00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:29.400]   - No, actually I haven't really gotten as much email on this.
[00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:30.400]   - Really?
[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:31.400]   - I get a lot of--
[00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:32.400]   - I get a lot of page views, but we're not--
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:35.400]   - They're sending, I don't know why they send me email complaining about you.
[00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:37.400]   - I have something to do with this.
[00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:38.400]   - Well we even got email about it.
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:39.400]   - Over at scene at us.
[00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:40.400]   - Scene I got email.
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:41.400]   - We'll see you in the story.
[00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:42.400]   - We're crazy.
[00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:43.400]   - It's crazy.
[00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:44.400]   - Okay.
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:46.400]   - That's exactly the best thing you could happen to you though.
[00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:49.400]   - It caused an OS war within my own company.
[00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:50.400]   - Yeah.
[00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:51.400]   - This is the emails flying around.
[00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:54.400]   It's like people defending it, people saying, "Oh, there's some truth here.
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:55.400]   You can't really back it up.
[00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:56.400]   One way or the other."
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:58.400]   - And then the Apple lovers of course come out of that.
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:09:59.400]   - Here's the Apple--
[00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:00.400]   - Here's the real user from the--
[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:01.400]   - This is the hard core user.
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:02.400]   - New York Times on Friday.
[00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:05.400]   Amazon now admits it's gonna open a music store.
[00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:07.400]   It's gonna make its own MP3 player.
[00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:08.400]   They're gonna take--
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:12.400]   They're gonna basically model themselves after Apple with the closed music store.
[00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:14.400]   - Are they gonna license the iPod design?
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:15.400]   - No.
[00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:16.400]   - Well, they did.
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:17.400]   - It's a dog.
[00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:18.400]   It's not gonna work.
[00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:19.400]   - But the--well, what they're saying is, look what Apple did right.
[00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:21.400]   They said, "We're gonna create a music store that only plays on our player.
[00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:22.400]   You wanna play our music.
[00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:23.400]   You gotta have your player."
[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:25.400]   So if we create a better--I think this is their thing.
[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:30.400]   And if we create a better music store--and they're gonna do subscription by the way, not--so
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:34.400]   you pay out monthly or yearly fee and you don't get all you can eat.
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:36.400]   And you'd have to use the Amazon player.
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:37.400]   - Good idea.
[00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:38.400]   - I wonder how long that'll take to crack.
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:39.400]   - I don't know.
[00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:42.400]   - I don't think it's a good idea at all.
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:45.400]   I don't think the Apple idea is very good idea.
[00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:46.400]   - I think it's an old idea.
[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:48.400]   - The problem comes down to the DRM.
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:50.400]   - I like this locked in stuff.
[00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:55.400]   - Apple doesn't license Fair Play to anyone, so you're stuck using their player with the Apple iTunes.
[00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:56.400]   - Really?
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:01.400]   - If Amazon licenses their DRM technology cheaply to enough people, then it would make at least
[00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:03.400]   an open platform distribute music on.
[00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:05.400]   - More open than Apple's current is.
[00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:07.400]   - Their goal would be to make a close platform.
[00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:10.400]   I mean, if you're gonna do what Apple did, you make a close platform, right?
[00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:13.400]   And hope that people like your music stores so much that they buy your player.
[00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:18.400]   - And you're placing then dependence on creating good hardware that people wanna buy, and that could be tricky.
[00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:23.400]   - I think you gotta hope that Apple doesn't lose their lawsuit over tying their music store to their player, too.
[00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:24.400]   - That's true, too.
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:26.400]   - But that keeps the record companies hacking on Apple's side.
[00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:30.400]   That's the other thing that I'll like cart one or one fee per all the downloads you want.
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:32.400]   I think the music companies are gonna go a little crazy about that one.
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:33.400]   - Let me see.
[00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:34.400]   - Let's go around the table.
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:35.400]   I'm very curious.
[00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:39.400]   Tom Merritt, which would you prefer buying music and owning it?
[00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:45.400]   We're talking digital downloads or subscribing and having, you know, if you don't pay, you lose all the music.
[00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:46.400]   - Oh, yeah, buying and owning.
[00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:47.400]   In fact, I don't even buy DRM music.
[00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:49.400]   I don't chop a iTunes music store.
[00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:50.400]   - Oh, you want a buy CDs?
[00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:56.400]   - I buy either CDs and Ripham or I buy MP3s clean off the net from places like Audio Lunchbox or Price Like That.
[00:11:56.400 --> 00:12:00.400]   - I'm actually gonna go with buying and own.
[00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:06.400]   However, I do know a couple of close friends who actually like the fact that they can buy and just have access to all this music.
[00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:13.400]   'Cause from what they tell me, it's like they don't like listening to the same music all the same time and having access to a vast library.
[00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:17.400]   You know, they're able to cycle through a bunch of music and not kind of get locked in.
[00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:18.400]   - Certain type of person that might make sense.
[00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:19.400]   - Yes.
[00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:20.400]   - They always listen to all this.
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:22.400]   - It's not a one-size-fits-all solution.
[00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:23.400]   - What do you think, Robert?
[00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:24.400]   Buy or rent?
[00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:27.400]   - I'm about to buy a new music player and it won't be an Apple iPod.
[00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:29.400]   So the DRM becomes a real big issue for me.
[00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:38.400]   And I'm not gonna buy anything that's locked to any player because they're not gonna provide a firmware update for my new phone or whatever player I'm gonna end up using as my primary player.
[00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:39.400]   That's really what it is.
[00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:43.400]   I mean, granted, I have a lot of CDs and a lot of MP3s are up to my hard drive that way.
[00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:48.400]   And I might take Tom's approach and just buy it without the DRM or buy the CD itself for good output.
[00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:50.400]   - For good albums that I appreciate.
[00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:51.400]   - Unless it comes from Sony.
[00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:53.400]   - Devorak, you just stick with those Edison cylinders.
[00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:54.400]   - There's still the best way.
[00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:55.400]   - I listen to Sirius.
[00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:57.400]   I don't care about owning or buying anything.
[00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:58.400]   - You're a serious guy.
[00:12:58.400 --> 00:12:59.400]   Is that 'cause of Stern?
[00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:00.400]   - No.
[00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:01.400]   - Of course.
[00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:02.400]   - I've actually never heard Stern show.
[00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:03.400]   - Oh, don't listen.
[00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:04.400]   - Apparently, I have listened to the--
[00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:05.400]   - Oh, serious.
[00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:08.400]   But apparently it's gotten really, really outrageous.
[00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:09.400]   - No, I'll probably like that.
[00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:10.400]   - No.
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:11.400]   - No.
[00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:14.400]   - It's more, you realize the restrictions he had on broadcast radio and how--
[00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:16.400]   - You bubble the love sponge is not out of control.
[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:19.400]   - It's not really, he can get there and he's got aspects to the show.
[00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:22.400]   - Do you mind if it's still the show that they're showing on TV?
[00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:24.400]   - Do they still show it?
[00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:27.400]   They show it on On Demand now, I believe, parts of it.
[00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:31.400]   It's not like, though they don't do the live show and yeah, these things done as far as I remember or no.
[00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:33.400]   - Answer is people want to buy music.
[00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:34.400]   They don't want to rent it.
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:35.400]   Forget it.
[00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:36.400]   It's a bad idea, I'm sorry.
[00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:37.400]   - What are you, McLaughlin?
[00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:38.400]   - Yeah.
[00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:39.400]   - Is he answering the question?
[00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:40.400]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:41.400]   - The question is moving.
[00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:42.400]   - You're wrong.
[00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:43.400]   - God, comic three.
[00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:45.400]   OS X has a worm.
[00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:46.400]   - A worm.
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:47.400]   - A marrot.
[00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:48.400]   Bad news for Mac Culsars?
[00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:49.400]   - No.
[00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:51.400]   - They have two worms.
[00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:53.400]   - Yeah, which worm were you referring to?
[00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:56.400]   - There was one that was a concept but this is an actual in the wild.
[00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:57.400]   - 50 people.
[00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:58.400]   - There's two in the wild.
[00:13:58.400 --> 00:13:59.400]   There's one Bluetooth one that came out today.
[00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:00.400]   - Oh, there's one one.
[00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:01.400]   - There's a Bluetooth one?
[00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:02.400]   - And they're both nothing.
[00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:03.400]   - Nothing to worry about.
[00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:04.400]   - Okay, bevel out there.
[00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:08.400]   It's your job to make something that works and destroys the entire environment.
[00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:10.400]   - It can't happen.
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:11.400]   - It can't happen.
[00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:12.400]   - It can happen.
[00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:15.200]   - If you order for you to get this worm, you'd have to, first of all, accept a file of her eye chat.
[00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:16.200]   Okay, that happened.
[00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:18.200]   Because especially because it's pictures of the new leopard operating.
[00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:19.200]   So, okay, that's cool.
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:20.200]   I'd like to see it.
[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:21.200]   You'd have to open that.
[00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:22.200]   - It's a tarball.
[00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:23.200]   - Zip tarball.
[00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:27.400]   Yeah, and then, and then, and then, you open the tarball and then it's not pictures, it's
[00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:28.400]   an application.
[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:29.400]   - I wonder why.
[00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:30.400]   Let me run it.
[00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:33.400]   - How do you get a story where says OS X worm has infected 50 computers?
[00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:34.400]   - That's what Sophos is saying.
[00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:35.400]   - I'm looking at some Sophos.
[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:36.400]   - It's probably all from Sophos.
[00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:37.400]   - It's probably all from Sophos.
[00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:38.400]   - 10% of the Mac user base infected.
[00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:39.400]   - It's probably all from friends.
[00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:42.800]   - They count this stuff, you know, because I don't know how.
[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:44.800]   The Sophos, you know, keeps track of this stuff.
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:46.200]   Actually, they said fewer than 50.
[00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:47.720]   So, it could be one, I don't know.
[00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:49.520]   - They're probably one person god of the extrapolate.
[00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:51.520]   - I think the whole thing is just a bit.
[00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:53.520]   - No, I bet you that's what they did.
[00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:55.000]   It's like, you know, Joe's motor.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.640]   - I got more mail on this than I got on the Dvorak column because everybody's going,
[00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:00.600]   "Mean, or mean, or mean, or see you Mac."
[00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:02.360]   - Oh yeah, all the blue windows guys, yeah.
[00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:04.800]   - Does anybody even make destructive viruses anymore?
[00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:05.800]   And ones that just rip your hard drive apart.
[00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:07.800]   - That's the whole thing with the Kamasutra.
[00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:08.800]   - Oh, okay.
[00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:11.640]   Because usually it's more like about taking over your system and using it to distribute
[00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:13.640]   email for spam for a bit more fun.
[00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:15.640]   - You know, the techniques I learned, yeah, it's more lit.
[00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:17.640]   - We missed the good old days where just, you know, your hard drive's hosed in like seconds.
[00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:20.640]   - Right, well, that's why everybody was worried about Kamasutra.
[00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:24.280]   You're right, they're very rare because mostly what they want to do is, you know, get a
[00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:28.560]   computer on a bot network and sell it to, yeah, sell it to the spammers.
[00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:30.720]   John, you had an interesting story.
[00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:33.240]   I'm going to let you bring this one up about phone.
[00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:35.240]   What is, first of all, what is F-O-N?
[00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:38.840]   - Well, you know, there's been a number of attempts to do what phone wants to do.
[00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:46.840]   - F-O-N is, say, they're trying to make a kind of a massive Wi-Fi free access grid,
[00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:47.840]   essentially.
[00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:48.840]   I mean, they have a slightly--
[00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:49.840]   - Like a big mesh network of Wi-Fi.
[00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:52.840]   - Yeah, but it's got its own, you know, it's got its got a few twists.
[00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:54.840]   It's not like, you know, I mean, they're all a little different.
[00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:55.840]   - The fine-life--
[00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:58.440]   - And all these things have failed, by the way, time after time, it just never works out
[00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:00.440]   because it just doesn't happen.
[00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:03.840]   - This is an Argentinian billionaire, or a Glensman or a Glensman.
[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:06.840]   - Wow, that's a recent economic downturn in that country.
[00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:07.840]   I didn't know they were able to--
[00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:10.840]   - Or maybe worth a billion in Argentinian dollars, probably.
[00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:11.840]   - I think--
[00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:12.840]   - The same as I believe.
[00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:15.840]   - Well, but I think that is locked to the--
[00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:18.840]   or used to be locked to the dollar, but it's maybe two to one now.
[00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:21.840]   But the problem is a bunch of bloggers got busted for--
[00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:27.840]   or at least they got outed, as it were, by the Wall Street Journal for working for these guys,
[00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:29.840]   you know, as advisors.
[00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:33.840]   And then without telling anybody they're making all these positive blog mentions, you know,
[00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:36.840]   and then they're all saying, well, you know, we were going to tell you.
[00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:38.840]   - So let's add them. Who was it?
[00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:39.840]   - Well, there's a whole group of them.
[00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:43.840]   If you go to the article in the journal, if you click on that, it kind of names most of them.
[00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:46.840]   - Okay, this is from the vorak.org/blog.
[00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:48.840]   - Yeah, I have it mentioned in the vorak.org/blog.
[00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:50.840]   - Gilmor, is it-- which Gilmor?
[00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:51.840]   Is it Dan or his brother?
[00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:52.840]   - Dan.
[00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:54.840]   - Dan, the people's media Gilmor?
[00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:55.840]   - P.F.
[00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:57.840]   - What is a citizen journalist?
[00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:59.840]   - Citizen journalist Dan Gilmor.
[00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:00.840]   - Are these people--
[00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:01.840]   - Are we all--
[00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:02.840]   - We're planning to be impartial users, posting something?
[00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:03.840]   - No, I don't know.
[00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:04.840]   You know, it seems to me--
[00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:10.840]   I mean, to be honest about, I've talked over this concept with a lot of these guys from Burke,
[00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:11.840]   man, I guess, you know.
[00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:16.840]   I've talked over this idea of using blogs as marketing tools with public relations people
[00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:19.840]   saying, you know, this is an opportunity at some point.
[00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:24.840]   Because, you know, they talk to writers in regular media, and these people are in the media.
[00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:28.840]   So the problem is that the way they handle this with this advisor is that--
[00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:29.840]   I don't know.
[00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:33.840]   It's almost like, if you remember, Comdex days, they would always have these huge pages
[00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:34.840]   of advisors.
[00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:35.840]   - Right.
[00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:36.840]   - There were all-- none of these people did any of these.
[00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:37.840]   - It's not quite a board member.
[00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:39.840]   It's a little bit less than a board member.
[00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:42.840]   - Yeah, you're supposed to be advising, but advising is not the same as just pumping it
[00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:44.840]   up in your publication.
[00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:45.840]   That's not advice.
[00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:46.840]   Here's my advice.
[00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:47.840]   I'll write it up.
[00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:48.840]   - Phone.
[00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:49.840]   - So David, I think I kind of--
[00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:56.840]   - David Eisenberg, who is on the advisory board, said, "In fact, technically we are not compensated."
[00:17:56.840 --> 00:18:01.840]   This is from Andrew Oloski's column in the registry.
[00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:05.840]   He says, "Technically, we're not compensated as no written agreement is in place.
[00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:08.840]   Just a-- get this non-specific verbal intent."
[00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:09.840]   - Oh, geez.
[00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:10.840]   - It just sound worse.
[00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:11.840]   - What am I going to do?
[00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:13.840]   - I'm going to drop some bag of money off of that.
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:14.840]   - That sounds like--
[00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:16.840]   - I mean, if they just come out and--
[00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:18.840]   - Meet me behind the bank.
[00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:20.840]   - Do me this favor.
[00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:21.840]   - I mean this--
[00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:24.840]   - Someday I may come to you.
[00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:28.840]   - But really, that's just-- that just speaks-- reflects more on human nature.
[00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:35.840]   You know, I mean, come on, you're not going to ever find a group of people who are above
[00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:36.840]   a little, you know--
[00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:37.840]   - I think you've got a group right here.
[00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:38.840]   - Yeah, we'll take the money.
[00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:40.840]   But we don't in advance.
[00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:41.840]   - Yeah, and we--
[00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:42.840]   - You know, you see the thing is you can't--
[00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:43.840]   - I'm specific.
[00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:46.840]   - The way if you can't set a deal up like this and you say, "Okay, we're going to hire you as an advisor."
[00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:52.840]   And, you know, you know, we'll figure out the deal later, because it sounds like you're trying
[00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:55.840]   to get the guy to write a bunch of stuff and then you're going to give him money.
[00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:58.840]   - I mean, if I said here, I give you 100-- or whatever, 100 bucks or something.
[00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:02.840]   And I want-- you have any advice for me and then you say, "Yeah, I think your thing sucks or it's good."
[00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:04.840]   I mean, does anybody think it sucks?
[00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:08.840]   And there-- does that advice-- and then there-- has anybody blogged it saying, "Oh, this is terrible?
[00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:10.840]   - No, it sucks."
[00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:11.840]   - This thing sucks.
[00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:12.840]   - No, it sucks.
[00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:14.840]   - It's amazing how uniformly positive all of the press has been on this.
[00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:17.840]   - Well, as if it was all from the same script, perhaps.
[00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:18.840]   - Yeah.
[00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:19.840]   - Well, I don't want to keep any--
[00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:20.840]   - That's the problem.
[00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:22.840]   - Well, I mean, it just seems to me there's no criticism in here.
[00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:25.840]   - Well, no, you're right, because if they got paid up front, then they can say whatever they want.
[00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:30.840]   But if it's-- if they're waiting, then yeah, it's like when you say enough nice things, then we'll-- we'll send you the check.
[00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:31.840]   - Yeah.
[00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:32.840]   - Sweet in the pot.
[00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:33.840]   - So, Mike, I guess--
[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:34.840]   - No, that's a blender.
[00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:39.840]   - This is not the first time, as you point out, that people have tried to influence bloggers, in fact, the White House.
[00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:40.840]   - Oh, they try to do it.
[00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:41.840]   - Right, and they buy people off.
[00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:45.840]   I mean, it seems to be more common now than it's ever been before, or people are getting busted more.
[00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:46.840]   I'm not absolutely sure.
[00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:47.840]   - We were talking about forums.
[00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:49.840]   This is a real problem in forums.
[00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:51.840]   Raj, you said that in-- what, car forums is on?
[00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:55.840]   - Well, a lot of consumer kind of, not-- which is advocacy, but for like--
[00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:56.840]   - Message boards.
[00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:59.840]   - Yeah, message boards for people looking to buy new automobiles, new pieces of electronic equipment.
[00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:01.840]   Oftentimes, just fine plants are pretty obvious.
[00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:05.840]   I mean, the original ones that used to see-- yeah, this product's great.
[00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:06.840]   I've had no trouble, you know?
[00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:07.840]   I don't understand what they're talking about.
[00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:08.840]   They're just trying to bad out the company.
[00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:13.840]   - See, that bomb, because I use like Amazon-- can we talk about this in Yelp and e-pinnions and stuff?
[00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:16.840]   - I've always thought that places are filled with shills.
[00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:18.840]   You were talking about some people hiring people.
[00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:20.840]   - Robert Herons is a job for somebody.
[00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:27.840]   - Friends sent me a job posting last week that listed-- the company was specifically looking for people to create 50 to 100 aliases on the various--
[00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:32.840]   the most popular blogs and places to post information like that for the user groups or whatever products they are.
[00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:36.840]   And you had to become-- you had to integrate yourself within these communities, and they knew you were a real person,
[00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:38.840]   and you had to respect, and then they start dropping product mentions.
[00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:41.840]   And if a product does come up, they would mention something positive.
[00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:42.840]   - A mole.
[00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:45.840]   - Yeah, like it's almost like-- you know, some was like being in a CIA person.
[00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:48.840]   - Yeah, they were going to go in there and then you get their confidence,
[00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:51.840]   and then you start feeding the essence.
[00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:52.840]   - But it's--
[00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:59.840]   - This happened during the Windows versus OS2 era, because Microsoft had these people that I've turned munchkins that were feeding stuff into these forums,
[00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:03.840]   and it turned out much later they admitted that they had these guys doing it.
[00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:05.840]   They stopped doing stuff like that, I believe.
[00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:11.840]   And I think-- funny thing was back in the '80s when I did my big first telecom book,
[00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:16.840]   one of the guys that was helping me with the book, one of the chapter writers,
[00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:22.840]   Dr. File find, who I've turned a lust track of, he was going to go on all these forums
[00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:25.840]   and start pumping the thing, and I said, "Go for it."
[00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:27.840]   And I still think it's a good idea.
[00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:29.840]   - I think of your honor.
[00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:30.840]   - I mean, if you think--
[00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:32.840]   - Well, you'd say who you are and why you're doing it.
[00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:38.840]   - You know, the funny thing is it did-- yeah, I agree with that, but I think that there's going to be a point where you're going to--
[00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:41.840]   if you're going to start hiring people to do this, and they don't know anything,
[00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:44.840]   and you just kind of train them to go on forums and pump the product,
[00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:46.840]   I don't see how you can get caught.
[00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:50.840]   You know, these guys got caught for some other reason because it was--
[00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:53.840]   I think it's a good idea.
[00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:57.840]   - What happens even in bars, you go in a bar and hire these guys, you go in and say, you know--
[00:21:57.840 --> 00:21:58.840]   - Chills.
[00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:00.840]   - Have you had a Zima lately?
[00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:01.840]   - Chills.
[00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:03.840]   - Last time I was doubled over.
[00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:07.840]   - That could become like the new gun for hire concept for a lot of people.
[00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:12.840]   They could approach one of these businesses and say, "Here, I have 100 accounts on these forums
[00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:16.840]   that are the most popular for these products, and I'm a well-respected member,
[00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:18.840]   pay me, and I'll get your message out there."
[00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:20.840]   - You know, I don't see it enough of those people together.
[00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:21.840]   - This isn't going to happen.
[00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:28.840]   Now, that said, sites like I mentioned before like Yelp, where you can see somebody's history.
[00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:29.840]   - I like that.
[00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:32.840]   - You know, and you can see everything they've done and everything they've posted.
[00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:33.840]   - That will--
[00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:35.840]   - You can spot-- you can spot this.
[00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:39.840]   So I think that the public can find a way around what this is going to happen,
[00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:42.840]   and if anybody likes it or not, there's going to be people out there, and it's going on now.
[00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:45.840]   They're going to be posting BS, and you see it.
[00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:48.840]   But you should be able to identify it, and things like this Yelp site
[00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:51.840]   allows you to really kind of identify the person.
[00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:55.840]   And when you see them veering into some, you know, promoting something weird,
[00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:56.840]   you can probably catch them.
[00:22:56.840 --> 00:22:58.840]   - Well, tight communities are going to have a--
[00:22:58.840 --> 00:22:59.840]   - I have to.
[00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:01.840]   - It's going to be harder for you to come into a tight community.
[00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:05.840]   You'll stick out like a sore thumb if you're just like, "Hey, this great new direct TV show is all--"
[00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:08.840]   - So like a mall, you have to create a persona.
[00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:12.840]   - You have to be really savvy in that whatever you're trying to pimp.
[00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:16.840]   Because oftentimes, you know, people call, especially in the car forms, people call.
[00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:21.840]   It was like, "Well, you should know from '92, '94 there was no power steering offered on that line.
[00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:26.840]   You know, they get really, they get really, really kind of pathetic about it.
[00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:28.840]   And then, you know, it's like, "Well, you know, that's full of--"
[00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:31.840]   "You know, don't listen to that guy. He's always blown, you know, smoking."
[00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:37.840]   So, you know, that could just be a kind of a reaction to that kind of, you know, behavior,
[00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:42.840]   where you have, you know, people just being, you know, kind of self-stouled vigilantes looking.
[00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:47.840]   - I just feel sorry for consumers because consumers who are not, you know, savvy to all of this.
[00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:51.840]   They go out. On the one hand, you've got professional journalists who are being perhaps paid by--
[00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:54.840]   - Well, actually, on the other hand, you go out-- - On the other hand, you go out.
[00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:58.840]   - Nobody's really being paid generally speaking to Flossup, but they're getting wind and dined and--
[00:23:58.840 --> 00:23:59.840]   - Or whatever. They're influenced. - You know.
[00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:04.840]   - And then on the other hand, you've got trusted, supposedly trusted people, real people in the forums,
[00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:07.840]   who are also being, you know, coerced.
[00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:11.840]   - You know, considering how capitalistic our society is, they should go back to teaching.
[00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:14.840]   Before they used to, you know, back in high school, they used to teach things like--
[00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:16.840]   - Trust no one. - Common sense.
[00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:21.840]   - No, but they-- like, like, like, you know, if you didn't want to go, like, the route of, like, going to the--
[00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:23.840]   - Don't believe everything you read, anything else.
[00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:28.840]   - They-- and part of home economics, they would tell you how to, like, you know, read ads, you know,
[00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:30.840]   how to get the best part of your dad. - Oh, you're a consumer economic con.
[00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:31.840]   - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah.
[00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:32.840]   - You were money con? - Yeah.
[00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:35.840]   - Did you say it was a class in high school? No, I just detested out of it.
[00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:38.840]   - I was a good test, yeah. - But you were required.
[00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:40.840]   - But you were required to teach? - Well, yeah.
[00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:42.840]   - But not in high school. - It used to be a lot of stuff like that.
[00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:44.840]   - It used to be just like this. - They don't give those courses anymore.
[00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:47.840]   - But just like those students. - They went to people to be stupid.
[00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:48.840]   - Mm-hmm. - I think it really is.
[00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:50.840]   It's better. It makes people buy more stuff.
[00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:54.840]   - I think they-- I went to a parent night at the-- my daughter's going to high school next year.
[00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:56.840]   I went to the parent night, and they did have, in fact, a course.
[00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:58.840]   I can't-- I think they-- what they called it.
[00:24:58.840 --> 00:24:59.840]   I thought it was going to be the sex course.
[00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:02.840]   You know, it was like human relationships or something.
[00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:05.840]   But one of the first things they tell you is, look, they're all trying to get you to eat their junk food,
[00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:07.840]   and then they're going to sell you a diet. So don't believe it.
[00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:09.840]   And I thought they ate pretty good. My daughter--
[00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:12.840]   - I thought that, of course. - Like you, Tom Merritt said, "I'm not taking that.
[00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:13.840]   I'm going to take French."
[00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:18.840]   - Well, anyway, I've talked to some top PR people about some of this,
[00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:21.840]   and they seem-- the professional, the big companies,
[00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:26.840]   seem to be pretty-- they like-- and they understand that there's a mechanism here
[00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:29.840]   that's going to be used-- blogs and forums and whatever-- some day in the future,
[00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:33.840]   but they're very dubious about it because they-- you know, because of the situation
[00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:35.840]   that happened with these guys.
[00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:37.840]   - It's embarrassing. - Yes, that's right.
[00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:39.840]   - It's embarrassing. And so they don't know how to do it.
[00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:43.840]   I mean, they know how to deal with the media because-- and they get plenty of ink from the media,
[00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:45.840]   but they don't quite know how to do this.
[00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:48.840]   And I'm not absolutely sure a perfect mechanism has been invented,
[00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:53.840]   but I eventually believe that bloggers will be part of a system
[00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:56.840]   where they get whined and die in the same way regular journalists do it.
[00:25:56.840 --> 00:26:00.840]   And the Democrats did the best job of it when they took those bloggers to the convention,
[00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:04.840]   and they just gave them a good time, and the bloggers were just so--
[00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:06.840]   - Oh, but they were easy. The bloggers just rolled over.
[00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:07.840]   - Oh, they rolled over. - They rolled over.
[00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:08.840]   - They rolled over. - They rolled over.
[00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:09.840]   - They rolled over. - They rolled over.
[00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:10.840]   - They were-- - They stretched my tummy.
[00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:12.840]   - You wh-- it was as funny as things.
[00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:15.840]   - But the real blogs, people were like-- they were like the biggest suckers I've ever seen.
[00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:17.840]   - Oh, my God. - Has somebody ever paid any attention to that?
[00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:18.840]   - Yeah.
[00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:21.840]   - Story four is World of Warcraft, the new golf.
[00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:22.840]   - Yeah. - You ain't kidding.
[00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:27.840]   - Joy Edo has a guild in World of Warcraft venture capitalist--
[00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:29.840]   - Oh, we know. - Called We Know.
[00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:31.840]   - Yeah. - And is it People We Know?
[00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:33.840]   Is it the idea? - I can't remember.
[00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:34.840]   - It was something like that. - It was something like that.
[00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:37.840]   We act like we know what we're talking about. That's what it was.
[00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:40.840]   - That's what it was. - But it's like the thing to be,
[00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:42.840]   and apparently, when they get together and in between killing monsters,
[00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:44.840]   they talk about their next investment.
[00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:45.840]   - What's the deal here? - Sure, yeah.
[00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:47.840]   - The deals are struck in World of Warcraft now.
[00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:49.840]   - I mean, I find this hard to believe.
[00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:52.840]   - You know, let's go kill that seven-headed dragon.
[00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:54.840]   And while we're at it, let's figure out what we want to do
[00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:56.840]   with the new venture capitalist money we did.
[00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:59.840]   - It's a virtual avatar world where you can send mail and items.
[00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:01.840]   - I don't even miss guild. - I think it sounds like a guild.
[00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:02.840]   - Join it.
[00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:04.840]   - I wonder if they let me know that you landed Priesten.
[00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:06.840]   He's only a level 17.
[00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:07.840]   - I'm a noob.
[00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:15.680]   - He's a king of
[00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:17.840]   what server they're on. - I bet you might sign what server they're on.
[00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:18.840]   - Yeah.
[00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:19.840]   - There really is no way to figure it out where we know it.
[00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:20.840]   - It's a special server on Intel.
[00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:22.840]   - Well, you should be able to search for we know, right?
[00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:24.840]   - You might be able to find a friend.
[00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:27.840]   - You think Joyito actually is a girl in World of Warcraft?
[00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:28.840]   Wouldn't that be weird?
[00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:29.840]   - Who knows?
[00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:30.840]   - Yeah, could be anything.
[00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:31.840]   - What if it was just a bot?
[00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:33.840]   - No, that would be cool.
[00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:35.840]   - So is it the new golf?
[00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:37.840]   I mean, PC Magazine wrote this article.
[00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:38.840]   I saw it in a number one.
[00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:40.840]   - I think it's a bunch of BS.
[00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:41.840]   Let's ask a golf magazine.
[00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:42.840]   - Four million subscribers?
[00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:43.840]   - Guys.
[00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:46.840]   - The premise being that that's where business will be done
[00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:47.840]   in the future.
[00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:48.840]   I don't know.
[00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:49.840]   Maybe it's the new bow.
[00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:50.840]   - It's being done there now.
[00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:51.840]   - I think so.
[00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:52.840]   - I don't think the interface is great.
[00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:57.840]   It's maybe with some of the enhancement interfaces you can add to the game would help.
[00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:01.840]   - But it's like you could do a lot of voice over IP stuff while you're in the game.
[00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:02.840]   - That's true.
[00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:03.840]   - I do hear that actually.
[00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:04.840]   - But that actually happens though.
[00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:05.840]   You'll be going, you know, I've seen this.
[00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:08.840]   You'll be running through World of Warcraft, monsters chasing or whatever.
[00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:12.840]   And there's just a bunch of people standing around, like, you know, with their org axes
[00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:13.840]   talking.
[00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:15.840]   It's like, what are you guys talking about?
[00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:18.840]   - I should just kind of go over and say, hey, what do you, hey, what do you, hey, hey, hey,
[00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:19.840]   - Stand in front of them and start dancing.
[00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:20.840]   - Jump around.
[00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:21.840]   - Or type in slide.
[00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:22.840]   - Start hacking.
[00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:23.840]   - Or slash part.
[00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:24.840]   - That's the best.
[00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:26.840]   - You can start killing them.
[00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:27.840]   - Yeah.
[00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:28.840]   - I don't think they do.
[00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:31.840]   - So you become an outcast both in the real world and?
[00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:32.840]   - Yes.
[00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:33.840]   - This is just tech luminaries, right?
[00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:36.840]   I mean, you don't have any members of the Produce Marketing Association in World of Warcraft.
[00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:39.840]   - I understand Dick Cheney is investigating a membership.
[00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:41.840]   - You know, he's got a shotgun with him.
[00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:42.840]   - You know, you have shotguns in the game.
[00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:43.840]   A little safer.
[00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:48.840]   - So I don't know if you saw this, Robert, the extreme tech they did in the L-Cost technology.
[00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:52.840]   - Oh, I had a chance to preview part one well before it hit our magazine.
[00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:57.340]   And Ray Sinera, who wrote that article, is arguably one of, he's been in the TV industry
[00:28:57.340 --> 00:28:58.340]   for ever.
[00:28:58.340 --> 00:29:00.840]   He's a scientist as far as TV development.
[00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:02.840]   - He's the guy who started DisplayMate.
[00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:06.840]   - That and early engineer for CBS, putting together their original TV systems as well.
[00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:07.840]   And they got a great idea.
[00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:09.840]   I mean, it's a three-part series, certainly well worth reading.
[00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:12.840]   But I thought the interesting thing was we had regular people and the guy experts look at
[00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:16.840]   these displays and the regular people liked the crudiest display.
[00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:17.840]   - Yeah.
[00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:18.840]   Why was that?
[00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:21.840]   - The brightest pictures sell the best and the most edge enhanced.
[00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:22.840]   It isn't for--
[00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:25.840]   - It was the edge, it was the sharp, the edge enhanced.
[00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:26.840]   They thought, oh, that's sharp.
[00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:27.840]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:28.840]   - When in fact it was schmushed.
[00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:31.840]   - That sells TVs and that's why every TV you'll buy in the store is set that way.
[00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:35.840]   So it's to be as bright as blue and as edge enhanced as possible as one of the main defaults.
[00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:40.340]   And unfortunately, that's not accurate or faithful to what the director had in mind, but it sells
[00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:42.340]   more TVs and that's just, that's the simple fact of it.
[00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:44.340]   And it won't change how retail channels.
[00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:47.340]   - And I gotta ask who's right as the expert writers is, I mean--
[00:29:47.340 --> 00:29:48.340]   - You know, it's--
[00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:50.340]   - I think most--
[00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:51.340]   - Oh, go ahead.
[00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:54.340]   - I was gonna say, but those TVs at their default settings, you bring that, that might look good in the store.
[00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:59.340]   You get that home and if you watch that for a while, it causes eye strain, it hurts.
[00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:01.340]   The TVs are so bright nowadays.
[00:30:01.340 --> 00:30:03.340]   - Rob, why do you appendages over that?
[00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:04.340]   - It's a class action lesson.
[00:30:04.340 --> 00:30:06.340]   - You need sunglasses to look at some of these.
[00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:09.340]   I've had TVs literally, if sitting in front of it, you could not look straight into it.
[00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:10.340]   There was so much light coming out of the front of it.
[00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:12.340]   And every year they keep bumping it up a couple more notches.
[00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:14.340]   And these are some of the brightest TVs to see.
[00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:16.340]   And it has nothing to do with how bright a TV can get.
[00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:18.340]   And when the room lighting becomes fixed.
[00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:19.340]   - Yeah, I mean, the little--
[00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:20.340]   - Nice little level.
[00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:21.340]   It's how dark can the TV get.
[00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:22.340]   - Every time I--
[00:30:22.340 --> 00:30:23.340]   - You know, last time.
[00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:24.340]   - You can educate, but--
[00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:27.340]   - I got my TV like three years ago and the first thing I did is you gotta turn on the brightness in contrast,
[00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:29.340]   'cause it's like everything's blown or washed out.
[00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:31.340]   - It has affected the way I write reviews now, though.
[00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:35.340]   I simply said, look, you're gonna see how it looks in the store, but you really have to get it dialed in right,
[00:30:35.340 --> 00:30:38.340]   or hopefully the manufacturers will provide either presets or settings.
[00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:42.340]   Then like once you get it home, you can just click one button, get it right to where it should be for night time viewing,
[00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:44.340]   daytime viewing, and store mode for the crazy--
[00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:52.340]   - I'm wondering if the little bit of the engineers, they tend to look at monitors, preview monitors to tell if whether or not a picture is, you know--
[00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:55.340]   - Well, you have something that's accurate and you compare it to what you're seeing.
[00:30:55.340 --> 00:31:02.340]   - But when they mix records, they still, in the studio, they'll put it on some crappy speakers just to see what it's gonna sound like when real people listen to it.
[00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:07.340]   - Well, yeah, but audio reference monitors that you use often don't sound as lively or--
[00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:08.340]   - Right.
[00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:09.340]   - Yeah, they can't slap--
[00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:15.340]   - Yeah, they do that for a person because they need to hear all the different tracks to see if there's any--
[00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:22.340]   - Yeah, the cool thing about Ray's shootout too is that he put together not only all L-cost technology, which is a good rear, but we're arguably the best rear projection technology out there.
[00:31:22.340 --> 00:31:23.340]   - What is this?
[00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:24.340]   - So people didn't know what we're--
[00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:25.340]   - Oh, liquid crystal and silicon.
[00:31:25.340 --> 00:31:32.340]   Rather than like a DLP chip where you have mirrors that reflect light, you basically have a liquid crystal mirror that can dim an individual pixels.
[00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:37.340]   And it turns out it came out of the gate doing really, really well. The first couple of displays were probably--
[00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:38.340]   - Eh.
[00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:43.340]   - But Sony's using it JVC, a company called Brilliant makes one of the-- that's displays I've seen this year.
[00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:44.340]   - Mm.
[00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:45.340]   - And the other thing too is it's set up.
[00:31:45.340 --> 00:31:46.340]   - Are they cheaper?
[00:31:46.340 --> 00:31:47.340]   - They can be.
[00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:48.340]   - They're typically though--
[00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:49.340]   - It's a replacement for LCD, but--
[00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:51.340]   - Yeah, it depends on the overall quality--
[00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:52.340]   - It's a DC projection I should have.
[00:31:52.340 --> 00:31:53.340]   - Does it have the--
[00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:54.340]   - Does it have the--
[00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:55.340]   - Make the red cube.
[00:31:55.340 --> 00:31:56.340]   - Does it have the screen effect?
[00:31:56.340 --> 00:32:00.340]   - No, it's very minimized because of the spacing between pixels is very, very small.
[00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:09.340]   That's gone and also the speed of the imaging system itself, it works at about 120 hertz, which is fast enough to eliminate all flicker, which--
[00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:10.340]   - Mm-hmm.
[00:32:10.340 --> 00:32:12.340]   - And because it doesn't incorporate a spinning color wheel--
[00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:13.340]   - Right, yeah.
[00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:15.340]   - --these are actually three separate panels and Christmas-plicked light sources.
[00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:18.340]   You don't have that rainbow artifact that you'll see on DLP TVs.
[00:32:18.340 --> 00:32:19.340]   - Right.
[00:32:19.340 --> 00:32:20.340]   - Some people are really susceptible to that.
[00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:21.340]   - Well, I like it.
[00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:23.340]   You know, most people don't notice until you train them to see it.
[00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:25.340]   - I-- I try to do that.
[00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:26.340]   - I do it all of this.
[00:32:26.340 --> 00:32:27.340]   It's kind of funny.
[00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:32.340]   You just give them, you know, there's ways of seeing it, and once they start seeing it, then they see it all the time and they get really mad at that.
[00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:34.340]   - You really-- you can't un-train, either.
[00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:35.340]   - Yeah, once you see it, you're--
[00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:36.340]   - Yeah, once you see it, you're too curious.
[00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:40.340]   - Any harsh-- any really fixed white line, and if you just move your eyes left and right really quick, it almost--
[00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:41.340]   you'll start to see the artifact.
[00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:42.340]   - Yeah, you'll see a nice rainbow.
[00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:43.340]   - Done it for everyone.
[00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:44.340]   - Even the latest-- - Quite pretty.
[00:32:44.340 --> 00:32:47.340]   - --even the latest DLP's I've seen are still effective.
[00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:50.340]   - I haven't seen one of the double speed spinning wheels, you can still see it.
[00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:55.340]   - The best way to go down, that's just to move to a three-chip system like these in digital cinema and commercial theaters.
[00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:57.340]   - So you don't need the wheel at all?
[00:32:57.340 --> 00:32:59.340]   - No, just-- and they're three times brighter, suddenly.
[00:32:59.340 --> 00:33:01.340]   - So do they have RGB and they're three times more expensive?
[00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:02.340]   - Do they have?
[00:33:02.340 --> 00:33:14.340]   - They actually, it's CES, two companies showed off an LED lighting system to replace the bulb that you sequential RGB LEDs, red, blue, green, but the problem is is that they're sequential, so you're going to have a red flash, a blue flash, and a green flash.
[00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:21.340]   - I don't think that's going to eliminate the color wheel problem, granted, you get rid of the spinning color wheel, and your bulb life's in like skyrockets because it's LED, but--
[00:33:21.340 --> 00:33:22.340]   - Right.
[00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:23.340]   - Well, we're on this--
[00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:24.340]   - They're coming out next month.
[00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:26.340]   - So we'll get some.
[00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:30.340]   - Well, I see Leo's got another story up which you want to mention as we talk about.
[00:33:30.340 --> 00:33:31.340]   - The end of corruption.
[00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:32.340]   - Yeah.
[00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:33.340]   (laughter)
[00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:42.340]   - AT&T apparently paid a couple of congressmen to promote this "preserving innovation and telecom act."
[00:33:42.340 --> 00:33:45.340]   The act that actually bans municipal Wi-Fi.
[00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:48.340]   According to Rushl's Shaw, the president of the law--
[00:33:48.340 --> 00:33:49.340]   - He's on the law.
[00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:53.340]   - --and Preston Grawler wrote about this in his blog on CMP.
[00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:59.340]   Shaw dug into AT&T campaign donations and found that the top recipient this year is Pete Sessions, a Texas Republican.
[00:33:59.340 --> 00:34:03.340]   Number two is Senator John Ensign, a Republican from Nevada.
[00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:06.340]   Sessions proposed this law.
[00:34:06.340 --> 00:34:10.340]   Ensign proposed a similar law in the Senate.
[00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:15.340]   Basically AT&T--now, we actually were blaming Verizon before, but I think maybe AT&T now has--
[00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:17.340]   - Well, you don't even know who AT&T is anymore.
[00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:20.340]   They bought out this company, and that company, they mean Pac Bell became--
[00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:21.340]   - Somebody--
[00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:23.340]   - AT&T and then renamed themselves AT&T.
[00:34:23.340 --> 00:34:25.340]   - Yeah, which is C, really.
[00:34:25.340 --> 00:34:26.340]   - Well, I'm confused.
[00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:27.340]   - We think--
[00:34:27.340 --> 00:34:28.340]   - Anyway, the phone company.
[00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:30.340]   - Wait until they change singular to AT&T, that'll mess up.
[00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:31.340]   - Right, it's all gonna be AT&T.
[00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:32.340]   - Yeah.
[00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:33.340]   - Anyway, I just thought we hit--
[00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:34.340]   - Where's Judge Green when you need him?
[00:34:34.340 --> 00:34:38.340]   - We've talked about this before, but I think that this is a little bit more of a smoking gun than that.
[00:34:38.340 --> 00:34:40.340]   - They should be protesting corporations that do that.
[00:34:40.340 --> 00:34:41.340]   - Yeah, that's unbelievable.
[00:34:41.340 --> 00:34:42.340]   - That's just--
[00:34:42.340 --> 00:34:44.340]   - I mean, it's clearly not in the public interest.
[00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:47.340]   - No, these congressmen should be taken out and shot.
[00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:48.340]   - Surprising for it.
[00:34:48.340 --> 00:34:49.340]   - They should go shoot and--
[00:34:49.340 --> 00:34:50.340]   - They should go shoot and--
[00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:51.340]   - Yeah, it would take care.
[00:34:51.340 --> 00:34:54.340]   - Free Wi-Fi, the greatest evil corporations have ever faced.
[00:34:54.340 --> 00:34:55.340]   - What?
[00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:56.340]   - Yeah, it's trouble.
[00:34:56.340 --> 00:34:57.340]   I tell you, it's trouble.
[00:34:57.340 --> 00:34:58.340]   - Oh, right.
[00:34:58.340 --> 00:34:59.340]   - It's trouble that they on the back--
[00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:00.340]   - Consistent free access.
[00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:02.340]   - Oh, we might not make a whole lot of money off of, but--
[00:35:02.340 --> 00:35:03.340]   - We might mention that.
[00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:07.340]   I mean, that's a big battle over going on right now, and with you guys Verizon blaming Google for,
[00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:10.340]   you know, being a parasite on our backbone.
[00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:11.340]   - Wait.
[00:35:11.340 --> 00:35:12.340]   (laughs)
[00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:17.340]   - Well, they're going after Congress trying to get the tiered internet thing written into the Broadband Law Act.
[00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:19.340]   - Let's get their names, man.
[00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:20.340]   - So what is the idea?
[00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:23.340]   They want to have a paid, a second paid internet or--
[00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:25.340]   - Yeah, well, no, they just want to charge everybody again.
[00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:30.340]   So, you know, Google's already paying for their bandwidth, and you and I are paying to get them--
[00:35:30.340 --> 00:35:31.340]   - They want to charge Google and us.
[00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:34.340]   - Yeah, so then they want to charge Google to go faster over the net, right?
[00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:38.340]   So that's the clever part, which is we'll still deliver your traffic at the old speed,
[00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:44.340]   but we're going to deliver our own traffic in Verizon's case at this new faster speed and use up all the rest of the bandwidth.
[00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:48.340]   - We've talked about this before, but there's got to be some way to kind of take back.
[00:35:48.340 --> 00:35:51.340]   - I think maybe you might just have to separate.
[00:35:51.340 --> 00:35:55.340]   - It's funny that the way it's been going, because this was like predicted in the late '90s.
[00:35:55.340 --> 00:35:58.340]   - When the NSF said, "We're going to--"
[00:35:58.340 --> 00:36:02.340]   - And then all these little ISPs bloomed all over the place, and there was a million of them,
[00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:04.340]   and then they were saying, "I guess it's not going to happen."
[00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:12.340]   And then all of a sudden, over the last few years, during the current situation in Congress,
[00:36:12.340 --> 00:36:17.340]   with everybody rolling over for these guys, they're becoming one big company again,
[00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:19.340]   and they're taking over the internet.
[00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:21.340]   They're putting the country at risk.
[00:36:21.340 --> 00:36:25.340]   - Well, the idea that the AT&T can go by Congressman really scares me as far as the tiered internet.
[00:36:25.340 --> 00:36:28.340]   I mean, it's bad enough to do killing the municipal networks, but--
[00:36:28.340 --> 00:36:29.340]   - Yeah, no kidding.
[00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:31.340]   I mean, it would be-- you know, just campaign contributions.
[00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:35.340]   - Not like there's enough money for people like me who are out there trying to find faster internet connections
[00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:38.340]   and willing to pay for it, let alone to provide free Wi-Fi.
[00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:42.340]   You know, it doesn't have to go eight meg-- two megabit, or one megabit, up and down,
[00:36:42.340 --> 00:36:45.340]   for free for everyone in major cities or wherever.
[00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:47.340]   - Anybody wants to set it up? - No, you shouldn't be able to do it.
[00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:49.340]   - Not even for free in some of these cases.
[00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:51.340]   Some of these cases, it was going to be for pay.
[00:36:51.340 --> 00:36:54.340]   It was just a municipal utility, and they said, "No way, and we want all the money."
[00:36:54.340 --> 00:36:55.340]   - Oh, wrong.
[00:36:55.340 --> 00:36:56.340]   - Should be like the water company.
[00:36:56.340 --> 00:36:59.340]   They got to get back to-- I mean, I think privatization is great,
[00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:02.340]   but I think that some situations need to-- you know, some of the things--
[00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:04.340]   - This is a case where it should be nationalized.
[00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:06.340]   You wouldn't allow a private company to run the interstate.
[00:37:06.340 --> 00:37:09.340]   - I think you would just separate it like a conflict.
[00:37:09.340 --> 00:37:14.340]   What they used to do with media companies like, you know, you couldn't--
[00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:15.340]   - You could license it.
[00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:16.340]   Maybe make an FCC licensing.
[00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:17.340]   That's what we need.
[00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:18.340]   - Yeah, maybe you might have to pay--
[00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:19.340]   - Protests all over my router wide open.
[00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:20.340]   - This is deadly world division.
[00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:21.340]   - This is deadly world division.
[00:37:21.340 --> 00:37:22.340]   - We're going to have to look at.
[00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:24.340]   - The Firefox memory leak.
[00:37:24.340 --> 00:37:25.340]   It's not a bug.
[00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:26.340]   It's a feature.
[00:37:26.340 --> 00:37:28.340]   - You know, it is a feature.
[00:37:28.340 --> 00:37:29.340]   - You know what?
[00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:30.340]   I don't think so.
[00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:32.340]   I was thinking about this, because I didn't even think about this until I realized that
[00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:37.340]   I go and hit my-- every so often you get on a web page that's got just so many links.
[00:37:37.340 --> 00:37:38.340]   - Right.
[00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:40.340]   - So, you have to be using tabs for this to happen.
[00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:41.340]   - I use a lot of tabs.
[00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:42.340]   - Okay.
[00:37:42.340 --> 00:37:44.340]   - And then you know, your system is bogged down.
[00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:45.340]   - Right.
[00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:48.340]   - And you go and you hit your task manager and Firefox, it's like stealing all the resources.
[00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:51.340]   - Because what's happening is it starts to load ranges.
[00:37:51.340 --> 00:37:52.340]   - Of megabytes.
[00:37:52.340 --> 00:37:55.340]   - Yeah, loading these pages into cache because it thinks you may go see them.
[00:37:55.340 --> 00:37:56.340]   - Yeah, you know what?
[00:37:56.340 --> 00:38:00.340]   If you have a reasonable speed, you don't-- I mean, this is an old-fashioned idea.
[00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:01.340]   - There's no advantage to it.
[00:38:01.340 --> 00:38:05.340]   - This was an idea that was years ago when you were on dial-up and you were-- and there
[00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:07.340]   weren't pages with a million ads--
[00:38:07.340 --> 00:38:10.340]   - People were selling these programs that would do this background down loading.
[00:38:10.340 --> 00:38:13.340]   - Yeah, but it was when-- you know, because there were only maybe a few links.
[00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:16.840]   But now you go onto a web page, especially something like say, any one of these commercial
[00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:22.340]   sites, they got 100 links to advertising and then all kinds of stuff.
[00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:23.340]   - Now you can't turn this off, I think.
[00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:24.340]   - Yeah, you can.
[00:38:24.340 --> 00:38:25.340]   I got to find out what does it look like.
[00:38:25.340 --> 00:38:29.340]   - The default per tab was supposedly eight layers or four to backwards.
[00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:32.640]   So, it was like if you had surfed on that page to a couple different pages, basically
[00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:35.340]   preserved like the last eight pages you would have been on for each tab.
[00:38:35.340 --> 00:38:38.340]   And then so, if you've been on a few-- you've got a few tabs up and you've been surfing a few different
[00:38:38.340 --> 00:38:40.340]   pages, so that it started adding up.
[00:38:40.340 --> 00:38:44.340]   And just by going in and either changing it to something far smaller or zero to disable it.
[00:38:44.340 --> 00:38:45.340]   - Zero it.
[00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:46.340]   I think it should be disabled.
[00:38:46.340 --> 00:38:47.340]   If you've got a high speed connection, you don't need this anymore.
[00:38:47.340 --> 00:38:51.340]   This is an old idea that-- yeah, it was great in 1993.
[00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:52.340]   - It was a mistake.
[00:38:52.340 --> 00:38:53.340]   - Anyways.
[00:38:53.340 --> 00:38:54.340]   - Yeah, I mean--
[00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:57.340]   - And it defaults differently depending on how much system RAM you have.
[00:38:57.340 --> 00:38:58.340]   - It does.
[00:38:58.340 --> 00:38:59.340]   It looks at your RAM.
[00:38:59.340 --> 00:39:04.340]   So, you type about colon config in there and you just-- it's the browser.session history.maxtotalviewer.
[00:39:04.340 --> 00:39:05.340]   You set it to zero.
[00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:06.340]   - Thanks, Robert.
[00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:07.340]   - Thanks, Robert.
[00:39:07.340 --> 00:39:11.340]   - Now, I didn't have this problem in Mozilla Suite, which I just stopped using when Firefox
[00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:12.340]   1.0 came out.
[00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:13.340]   And I saw this--
[00:39:13.340 --> 00:39:14.340]   - It must have changed as a wall.
[00:39:14.340 --> 00:39:15.340]   - It's not maybe switched to C-Monkey.
[00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:19.340]   I wonder if C-Monkey does this, because that's the new Mozilla Suite that has the composer
[00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:20.340]   monkey.
[00:39:20.340 --> 00:39:21.340]   - It's just a setting, you know?
[00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:23.340]   I mean, I'm sure it has the capability.
[00:39:23.340 --> 00:39:26.340]   Really, the only question is what they set the default to be when you install the browser,
[00:39:26.340 --> 00:39:27.340]   you know?
[00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:30.340]   And it should probably should be turned off unless you-- you know, on a slow--
[00:39:30.340 --> 00:39:32.340]   - Yeah, it's using 50% of my memory right now.
[00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:33.340]   - Is it?
[00:39:33.340 --> 00:39:34.340]   - Yeah.
[00:39:34.340 --> 00:39:35.340]   Just checked.
[00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:37.340]   - I think that's the problem I run into on websites that we mentioned.
[00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:41.300]   It was just the advertising that's linked on other-- it's being distributed from other
[00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:43.340]   servers outside of the domain you're currently visiting.
[00:39:43.340 --> 00:39:44.340]   And sometimes--
[00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:45.340]   - Turned out.
[00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:46.340]   Turned out stuff off.
[00:39:46.340 --> 00:39:50.340]   - I was using Adblock and updated filter sets to keep strip all ads out.
[00:39:50.340 --> 00:39:51.340]   - You could--
[00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:52.340]   - I visit a lot of pages where I like to--
[00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:53.340]   - Yeah.
[00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:55.340]   - I don't think turning off ads is a good idea, especially on our site.
[00:39:55.340 --> 00:39:56.340]   - I just--
[00:39:56.340 --> 00:39:59.980]   - No, but I ended up disabling all of that and going back to the old way I used to surf,
[00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:02.340]   and I'm just amazed at how much longer things take the load up.
[00:40:02.340 --> 00:40:03.340]   - Oh, yeah.
[00:40:03.340 --> 00:40:05.340]   - The sheer number of objects being thrown on--
[00:40:05.340 --> 00:40:08.340]   - But it's simple setting in Firefox just to say block third party images.
[00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:09.340]   - Oh, okay.
[00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:13.340]   - Now, that kind of screws up some sites, including ours, because I sometimes put images on another
[00:40:13.340 --> 00:40:15.340]   server, but you know, a big deal.
[00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:17.340]   - No, that would screw up most sites, most bloggers.
[00:40:17.340 --> 00:40:20.340]   - Yeah, we'll get our images from another-- your's is an example.
[00:40:20.340 --> 00:40:21.340]   I'm sure you--
[00:40:21.340 --> 00:40:22.340]   - I did de-blink a lot of stuff.
[00:40:22.340 --> 00:40:25.340]   I try to do-- don't do it with the small sites that can't afford the bandwidth.
[00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:30.340]   I mean, it's usually the BBC or something, but-- or the story that I'm linking to, it will
[00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:31.340]   have an image.
[00:40:31.340 --> 00:40:32.340]   I just put it up.
[00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:37.340]   It's very controversial that people do that, but the fact of the matter is that you can
[00:40:37.340 --> 00:40:41.340]   do that legally and you can't really steal images, put them on your own server and serve
[00:40:41.340 --> 00:40:43.340]   them, that's actually a legal copyright violation.
[00:40:43.340 --> 00:40:44.340]   - So it's actually--
[00:40:44.340 --> 00:40:46.340]   - I thought de-blink to somebody's image is--
[00:40:46.340 --> 00:40:47.340]   - For mallegal perspective.
[00:40:47.340 --> 00:40:49.340]   - But it's considered rude.
[00:40:49.340 --> 00:40:51.340]   - Right, because you're sucking their bandwidth.
[00:40:51.340 --> 00:40:52.340]   - Yeah, but you know--
[00:40:52.340 --> 00:40:54.340]   - So the question is download their image or use their bandwidth.
[00:40:54.340 --> 00:40:55.340]   - Break the law or be rude.
[00:40:55.340 --> 00:40:56.340]   Which one you want to do?
[00:40:56.340 --> 00:40:57.340]   - I'm rude anyway.
[00:40:57.340 --> 00:41:01.340]   - I would just take and make an ASCII image of that and just put it on.
[00:41:01.340 --> 00:41:03.340]   - What if you took a screenshot hat?
[00:41:03.340 --> 00:41:04.340]   - Break the law.
[00:41:04.340 --> 00:41:05.340]   - Break the law.
[00:41:05.340 --> 00:41:06.340]   - Break the law.
[00:41:06.340 --> 00:41:07.340]   - You took a screenshot and just cropped it.
[00:41:07.340 --> 00:41:08.340]   - Oh, I forgot.
[00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:09.340]   I have so much--
[00:41:09.340 --> 00:41:10.340]   - I think that--
[00:41:10.340 --> 00:41:11.340]   - --twit merchandise now.
[00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:12.340]   People have been sending me, because we said we're going to be opening this door and we're
[00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:13.340]   working on different things.
[00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:14.340]   - Oh yeah, so did you bring anything for us?
[00:41:14.340 --> 00:41:15.340]   - I forgot.
[00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:17.340]   And I have Twit Army buttons.
[00:41:17.340 --> 00:41:18.340]   I have--
[00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:19.340]   - I need a hoodie.
[00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:20.340]   - I need a hoodie.
[00:41:20.340 --> 00:41:21.340]   - We got hoodies in the--
[00:41:21.340 --> 00:41:22.340]   - Those hoodies are sweet.
[00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:24.340]   - Somebody sent me Twit Toothbrushes.
[00:41:24.340 --> 00:41:25.340]   - Wow.
[00:41:25.340 --> 00:41:26.340]   - Yummy.
[00:41:26.340 --> 00:41:27.340]   - What are they for?
[00:41:27.340 --> 00:41:28.340]   - They're using--
[00:41:28.340 --> 00:41:30.340]   - I have like 1,000--
[00:41:30.340 --> 00:41:31.340]   - So anyway, thank you.
[00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:32.340]   - That hygiene is important.
[00:41:32.340 --> 00:41:34.340]   - What's a Twit Toothbrushes that says Twit under the--
[00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:35.340]   - Yeah, it's Twit brush.
[00:41:35.340 --> 00:41:36.340]   - --an animal.
[00:41:36.340 --> 00:41:37.340]   - Yeah, I don't know if I can get from the dentist.
[00:41:37.340 --> 00:41:38.340]   - It is.
[00:41:38.340 --> 00:41:40.340]   - The dentist specializes in dental giveaways.
[00:41:40.340 --> 00:41:43.340]   - Now, if he has the son of care attachment from my electric toothbrush, I'll take that.
[00:41:43.340 --> 00:41:45.340]   - You're going to have to blog the--
[00:41:45.340 --> 00:41:46.340]   - I got it.
[00:41:46.340 --> 00:41:47.340]   - --all the guys who did all the stuff so you can--
[00:41:47.340 --> 00:41:48.340]   - I got it.
[00:41:48.340 --> 00:41:49.340]   Get this shot.
[00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:50.340]   I got to show you this.
[00:41:50.340 --> 00:41:51.340]   This is Scott E. Best.
[00:41:51.340 --> 00:41:52.340]   Look at that.
[00:41:52.340 --> 00:41:53.340]   There's--
[00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:54.340]   - You should have had--
[00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:55.340]   You should pay for that.
[00:41:55.340 --> 00:41:56.340]   That's an ad.
[00:41:56.340 --> 00:41:57.340]   - He did pay for it.
[00:41:57.340 --> 00:41:58.340]   He gave you a free hoodie.
[00:41:58.340 --> 00:41:59.340]   - He gave me a free hoodie.
[00:41:59.340 --> 00:42:00.340]   I didn't pay it enough.
[00:42:00.340 --> 00:42:01.340]   - That's a nontraditional average.
[00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:02.340]   - I will get it.
[00:42:02.340 --> 00:42:05.340]   - Scott, though, because what he is doing is giving us a coupon code.
[00:42:05.340 --> 00:42:06.340]   $30 off of the--
[00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:07.340]   It's not a Twit hoodie.
[00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:09.340]   It's a Scott E. Best hoodie, but he has all the zippers.
[00:42:09.340 --> 00:42:10.340]   - A bajillion pockets.
[00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:11.340]   - It's really cool.
[00:42:11.340 --> 00:42:13.340]   You use a Scott E. Best things, right?
[00:42:13.340 --> 00:42:14.340]   - I like their vests.
[00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:15.340]   - Honestly, it's like a camera vests or--
[00:42:15.340 --> 00:42:17.340]   - I don't know if you can get a vests or a photographer.
[00:42:17.340 --> 00:42:18.340]   - --not a photographer.
[00:42:18.340 --> 00:42:19.340]   - But we're going to get a Scott E. Best.
[00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:26.340]   It's got 43 zippers in the thing, so just put your hand in my pocket.
[00:42:26.340 --> 00:42:29.340]   - I've seen that trick before.
[00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:32.340]   I'm not buying it.
[00:42:32.340 --> 00:42:33.340]   - It's a great thing.
[00:42:33.340 --> 00:42:34.340]   - It's a great thing.
[00:42:34.340 --> 00:42:36.340]   - Anyway, he has offered us $30 off.
[00:42:36.340 --> 00:42:38.340]   I have to get the coupon code.
[00:42:38.340 --> 00:42:39.340]   Oh, it's Twit.
[00:42:39.340 --> 00:42:44.340]   Okay, so if you go to ScottEves.com and you can get $30 off of--
[00:42:44.340 --> 00:42:45.340]   This is only going to--
[00:42:45.340 --> 00:42:46.340]   Well, supplies last.
[00:42:46.340 --> 00:42:51.340]   I wanted to get some premiums for your Twit listener, so he was very kind to offer these.
[00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:54.340]   No, he's not paying us to do this.
[00:42:54.340 --> 00:42:55.340]   - I know.
[00:42:55.340 --> 00:42:56.340]   - I know, I know, I know.
[00:42:56.340 --> 00:42:57.340]   - Let me see what the deal is.
[00:42:57.340 --> 00:42:59.340]   - Mr. Jordan, he's a nice guy.
[00:42:59.340 --> 00:43:00.340]   - Hey.
[00:43:00.340 --> 00:43:04.340]   - The ultimate hoodie or the Sport Tech 4.0, so you go to ScottEves.com and you can--
[00:43:04.340 --> 00:43:05.340]   - These are expensive.
[00:43:05.340 --> 00:43:07.340]   - Well, not if you get $30 off.
[00:43:07.340 --> 00:43:08.340]   - Well, made, too.
[00:43:08.340 --> 00:43:10.340]   - Listen, you can't get pockets like this on your head.
[00:43:10.340 --> 00:43:12.340]   - The hoodie's everything I've made by him, I still have.
[00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:13.340]   - No, these are great.
[00:43:13.340 --> 00:43:14.340]   - Okay, well, I'll try to--
[00:43:14.340 --> 00:43:15.340]   - Even the hats.
[00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:16.340]   - I'll get you a warm, a freebie, also get--
[00:43:16.340 --> 00:43:17.340]   - I'll get you a warm.
[00:43:17.340 --> 00:43:18.340]   - I'll get you a warm.
[00:43:18.340 --> 00:43:19.340]   - Hey, you know, friends.
[00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:20.340]   - Hey, 'cause, you know, you can't--
[00:43:20.340 --> 00:43:24.340]   - You've got a jacket with a liner in it that I really liked and a really tough, good coat,
[00:43:24.340 --> 00:43:25.340]   but--
[00:43:25.340 --> 00:43:26.340]   - All right, we'd never bought this guy.
[00:43:26.340 --> 00:43:27.340]   - Jeez.
[00:43:27.340 --> 00:43:28.340]   - I like his stuff.
[00:43:28.340 --> 00:43:29.340]   I don't know.
[00:43:29.340 --> 00:43:30.340]   - I'm a wanker.
[00:43:30.340 --> 00:43:31.340]   - Man, you guys are unbelievable.
[00:43:31.340 --> 00:43:33.340]   - Hey, you weren't.
[00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:34.340]   - Scott's a nice guy.
[00:43:34.340 --> 00:43:35.340]   I like him.
[00:43:35.340 --> 00:43:37.340]   I just want to support him, 'cause I like his business.
[00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:39.340]   I like his products.
[00:43:39.340 --> 00:43:40.340]   Party poker.
[00:43:40.340 --> 00:43:41.340]   - Yeah.
[00:43:41.340 --> 00:43:42.340]   - Mate.
[00:43:42.340 --> 00:43:43.340]   - Party, what?
[00:43:43.340 --> 00:43:44.340]   - It just says a really--
[00:43:44.340 --> 00:43:45.340]   - Party poker.
[00:43:45.340 --> 00:43:46.340]   - That's the--
[00:43:46.340 --> 00:43:49.340]   - If I wore a party poker hat, think of the money.
[00:43:49.340 --> 00:43:50.340]   - Oh, they pay big dough.
[00:43:50.340 --> 00:43:55.340]   If you're an affiliate with them, 'cause I've been looking at affiliate systems, obviously.
[00:43:55.340 --> 00:43:58.340]   - So you put one of those blinking things that say, "Play poker."
[00:43:58.340 --> 00:44:01.340]   - I think it's either 25 bucks or 50 bucks a person.
[00:44:01.340 --> 00:44:02.340]   - If they sign up?
[00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:03.340]   - Yeah.
[00:44:03.340 --> 00:44:04.340]   - Or do they have--
[00:44:04.340 --> 00:44:05.340]   - It's really high.
[00:44:05.340 --> 00:44:06.340]   It's really high.
[00:44:06.340 --> 00:44:09.340]   - Or like the boxers who get goldandpalace.com, like, penciled in on their back or something.
[00:44:09.340 --> 00:44:10.340]   - I'll give it a--
[00:44:10.340 --> 00:44:11.340]   - Yeah.
[00:44:11.340 --> 00:44:12.340]   - Well, the reason I'm being a--
[00:44:12.340 --> 00:44:13.340]   - I'm a little bit more believable.
[00:44:13.340 --> 00:44:14.340]   These boxes got during this.
[00:44:14.340 --> 00:44:15.340]   Some of them sweated off and some of them--
[00:44:15.340 --> 00:44:16.340]   - I know, yeah.
[00:44:16.340 --> 00:44:17.340]   - But I'm thinking it's gonna be a--
[00:44:17.340 --> 00:44:21.060]   - They had one in a day, a really famous boxer, a boxing fan.
[00:44:21.060 --> 00:44:24.140]   I mean, this guy was like a high-end guy, and he's like, "Got to sing on his books."
[00:44:24.140 --> 00:44:26.020]   And he's making millions on this fight.
[00:44:26.020 --> 00:44:27.020]   - Anyway.
[00:44:27.020 --> 00:44:30.020]   - He's picking up another 50 grand or whatever they get for the hand-duty envelope.
[00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:35.020]   - That sandwich with the Mary's face on the grilled cheese sandwich, it paid like 60 bucks,
[00:44:35.020 --> 00:44:36.020]   thousand bucks for that.
[00:44:36.020 --> 00:44:37.020]   That was--
[00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:39.020]   They got money to burn these goldandpalace guys.
[00:44:39.020 --> 00:44:40.020]   Anyway.
[00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:43.180]   - Maybe a bad business coming down the road because--
[00:44:43.180 --> 00:44:44.180]   - I wonder.
[00:44:44.180 --> 00:44:46.180]   - I wondered, is this illegal?
[00:44:46.180 --> 00:44:48.860]   And apparently it is illegal to gamble online.
[00:44:48.860 --> 00:44:50.860]   - Yeah, the Wire Act.
[00:44:50.860 --> 00:44:51.860]   - The Wire Act.
[00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:55.780]   And it's, of course, illegal to run such an operation in the United States.
[00:44:55.780 --> 00:44:57.420]   - Cut into Vegas as action, man.
[00:44:57.420 --> 00:44:58.580]   - You know, in Atlantic City.
[00:44:58.580 --> 00:45:01.500]   - So now there is a new law that--
[00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:03.860]   - Is this a new law or a proposed law?
[00:45:03.860 --> 00:45:04.860]   - A proposed law.
[00:45:04.860 --> 00:45:05.860]   It's not a law yet.
[00:45:05.860 --> 00:45:11.940]   - It's a bill that says, "Playing poker online will be a punishable offense five years in
[00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:12.940]   prison."
[00:45:12.940 --> 00:45:13.940]   - Yeah, right.
[00:45:13.940 --> 00:45:15.420]   So this is going to be a dead letter law.
[00:45:15.420 --> 00:45:17.300]   They can't catch anybody and they won't force it.
[00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:18.300]   It's ridiculous.
[00:45:18.300 --> 00:45:19.500]   - Five years in prison.
[00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:20.500]   So--
[00:45:20.500 --> 00:45:21.500]   - How are they going to catch you?
[00:45:21.500 --> 00:45:22.500]   I mean, the--
[00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:23.500]   - Well, they know what you're doing.
[00:45:23.500 --> 00:45:24.500]   Go sit in the library and play.
[00:45:24.500 --> 00:45:25.500]   - Well, what are we doing?
[00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:26.500]   - The car is--
[00:45:26.500 --> 00:45:30.700]   - I just wrote something on, you know, the deep packet analysis stuff that's going on.
[00:45:30.700 --> 00:45:33.580]   Now they're trying to do, I mean, the big companies-- you know, Cisco's got some new
[00:45:33.580 --> 00:45:38.140]   gear where you can say, "Ah, this traffic that we're getting here is Skype."
[00:45:38.140 --> 00:45:39.980]   So then they want to charge them more.
[00:45:39.980 --> 00:45:40.980]   - Ah, see, that'll go--
[00:45:40.980 --> 00:45:44.220]   - So there's another one of the phone companies are getting Cisco doesn't care.
[00:45:44.220 --> 00:45:49.180]   They sell you-- they're grandma down the river to sell an extra, you know, router.
[00:45:49.180 --> 00:45:52.620]   So they build a router that does all this stuff and then it's expensive and they sell it to
[00:45:52.620 --> 00:45:53.620]   the phone companies.
[00:45:53.620 --> 00:45:55.580]   The phone companies use it and they say, "Well, you know, the way we're going to charge you
[00:45:55.580 --> 00:46:00.100]   for your connection is that, you know, if you have local and long distance service with
[00:46:00.100 --> 00:46:01.300]   us, it's going to be this much.
[00:46:01.300 --> 00:46:07.820]   If you use VoIP, you're going to be charged an extra-- so many cents a minute or whatever.
[00:46:07.820 --> 00:46:08.980]   And we know that you're using it.
[00:46:08.980 --> 00:46:10.340]   You're so high, you can even know.
[00:46:10.340 --> 00:46:13.820]   But with these new deep packet analysis systems, you can see that it's--
[00:46:13.820 --> 00:46:16.140]   - Oh, it's brilliant because then they can charge you for your ISP.
[00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:18.220]   They can charge the companies for the bandwidth.
[00:46:18.220 --> 00:46:21.540]   They can charge Vonage Extra to carry the VoIP and then they can charge you extra to
[00:46:21.540 --> 00:46:22.540]   use the VoIP.
[00:46:22.540 --> 00:46:26.500]   - Well, there are quite a few people who listen to it who cannot in fact use BitTorrent because
[00:46:26.500 --> 00:46:29.740]   their ISP is sniffing for BitTorrent Pack.
[00:46:29.740 --> 00:46:31.620]   Not just the ports, but they're sniffing for BitTorrent Pack.
[00:46:31.620 --> 00:46:32.620]   - That's Bit discrimination.
[00:46:32.620 --> 00:46:36.820]   - And that's why BitTorrent is-- - And that's why BitTorrent is starting
[00:46:36.820 --> 00:46:44.100]   to put encryption into its protocol so that it will hide what's going on and in fact allow
[00:46:44.100 --> 00:46:45.100]   people to use BitTorrent.
[00:46:45.100 --> 00:46:46.100]   I guess that's what's going to happen.
[00:46:46.100 --> 00:46:48.420]   - I think Skype's doing that now.
[00:46:48.420 --> 00:46:52.380]   - Actually, that was a big story this week because the feds can't wiretap Skype.
[00:46:52.380 --> 00:46:54.220]   - Well, hasn't there always been that way?
[00:46:54.220 --> 00:46:57.340]   Every VoIP package I've looked at includes pretty high-grade encryption.
[00:46:57.340 --> 00:46:59.340]   - I don't have echelon or some pretty much--
[00:46:59.340 --> 00:47:01.340]   - There's ways that there's a way-- - So you're a terrorist.
[00:47:01.340 --> 00:47:04.180]   - You may have to-- - You just use a free Skype and they can't--
[00:47:04.180 --> 00:47:05.340]   - You know, you would have.
[00:47:05.340 --> 00:47:09.860]   - The simple networks do not have-- - You would have the encryption in place,
[00:47:09.860 --> 00:47:14.700]   but this analysis, I'm sure you can still tell that it's a phone call.
[00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:15.700]   - It's good.
[00:47:15.700 --> 00:47:17.700]   I'm sure they have a lot longer to crack it.
[00:47:17.700 --> 00:47:20.260]   - You know, you go overseas and buy the stuff though that's--
[00:47:20.260 --> 00:47:21.260]   - Technically uncrackable.
[00:47:21.260 --> 00:47:23.620]   - You could probably know that they're unrealistic.
[00:47:23.620 --> 00:47:24.620]   - Unrealistic.
[00:47:24.620 --> 00:47:26.860]   - A tunnel between Part A and Part B.
[00:47:26.860 --> 00:47:28.860]   You don't know what traffic's on that tunnel.
[00:47:28.860 --> 00:47:30.860]   You just know that there is a connection.
[00:47:30.860 --> 00:47:32.860]   - I think through analysis you should be able to figure it out.
[00:47:32.860 --> 00:47:34.860]   - And then we have the quantum encryption on a sh--
[00:47:34.860 --> 00:47:37.860]   - Take a look at that stream and say, "Ah, that's typical of a phone connection."
[00:47:37.860 --> 00:47:39.860]   - But they might not know what's in it, I guess.
[00:47:39.860 --> 00:47:40.860]   - Yeah, they don't need to know what's in it.
[00:47:40.860 --> 00:47:41.860]   They just need to know it isn't.
[00:47:41.860 --> 00:47:42.860]   - No, it's a charge here.
[00:47:42.860 --> 00:47:43.860]   - And they can charge you another dollar.
[00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:44.860]   - Or for the terrorists, they need to know it.
[00:47:44.860 --> 00:47:45.860]   - So why don't they just go-- - Oh, the terrorists are--
[00:47:45.860 --> 00:47:46.860]   - Then-- - Terror--
[00:47:46.860 --> 00:47:49.860]   - I don't think terrorists are using Skype, you know, from a cave in Afghanistan.
[00:47:49.860 --> 00:47:51.860]   - No, they hate freedom.
[00:47:51.860 --> 00:47:52.860]   - You know.
[00:47:52.860 --> 00:47:56.860]   - The security experts are not completely convinced that Skype is as secure as it seems.
[00:47:56.860 --> 00:47:57.860]   - That means it's pulling it.
[00:47:57.860 --> 00:47:58.860]   - Because the company hasn't made it--
[00:47:58.860 --> 00:47:59.860]   - That's back doorbell.
[00:47:59.860 --> 00:48:00.860]   - They've left the one there.
[00:48:00.860 --> 00:48:02.860]   - They're already open to review.
[00:48:02.860 --> 00:48:06.860]   But according to Bruce Schneier, security expert, if Skype's encryption is weaker than believe,
[00:48:06.860 --> 00:48:12.860]   it still would stymie the kind of broad eavesdropping that the NSA is reputed to be performing the echelon type stuff.
[00:48:12.860 --> 00:48:17.860]   Because they're not gonna, you know, even if it's only, you know, 40-bit encryption,
[00:48:17.860 --> 00:48:20.860]   they're not gonna crack all of these streams to figure out what's going on.
[00:48:20.860 --> 00:48:21.860]   - Right.
[00:48:21.860 --> 00:48:25.860]   - He says even a weekly encrypted call would force an eavesdropping to spend hours of time cracking it.
[00:48:25.860 --> 00:48:28.860]   Some of my privacy of voice is just illegal.
[00:48:28.860 --> 00:48:30.860]   - These guys are using throwaway phones.
[00:48:30.860 --> 00:48:34.860]   - Skype says there are no back doors that could let government bypass the encryption.
[00:48:34.860 --> 00:48:35.860]   - What about Skype?
[00:48:35.860 --> 00:48:38.860]   - However, he says they cooperate fully with all lawful requests from relevant authorities.
[00:48:38.860 --> 00:48:39.860]   - I gave up on gizmo.
[00:48:39.860 --> 00:48:41.860]   I couldn't get it off my system.
[00:48:41.860 --> 00:48:45.860]   I mean, it would--no, it's just always booed all the time and I couldn't cancel the things.
[00:48:45.860 --> 00:48:46.860]   - A lot of applications do that.
[00:48:46.860 --> 00:48:47.860]   - I don't like that.
[00:48:47.860 --> 00:48:50.860]   - And I couldn't figure a way to stop it from doing that.
[00:48:50.860 --> 00:48:51.860]   - I think it's worse than Windows.
[00:48:51.860 --> 00:48:54.860]   - Quip time is my other big ticket to them.
[00:48:54.860 --> 00:48:57.860]   You uncheck the boxes during the install.
[00:48:57.860 --> 00:48:59.860]   It just sticks itself right back in and it takes--
[00:48:59.860 --> 00:49:00.860]   - Where we got this fight?
[00:49:00.860 --> 00:49:04.860]   - You say don't install it as my primary music player.
[00:49:04.860 --> 00:49:06.860]   Don't take over all my associations for my programs.
[00:49:06.860 --> 00:49:07.860]   Uncheck that.
[00:49:07.860 --> 00:49:08.860]   Uncheck the other things.
[00:49:08.860 --> 00:49:10.860]   Don't start on the Windows startup and both things happen immediately.
[00:49:10.860 --> 00:49:13.860]   And it's just like, oh, and then I gotta go back in and suddenly--oh.
[00:49:13.860 --> 00:49:16.860]   - You have to use every phone to actually uncheck it.
[00:49:16.860 --> 00:49:17.860]   - Really?
[00:49:17.860 --> 00:49:18.860]   - No, no.
[00:49:18.860 --> 00:49:20.860]   You can go in after it's installed and find all the controls.
[00:49:20.860 --> 00:49:21.860]   - Oh, no, no, no.
[00:49:21.860 --> 00:49:24.860]   - In the buried menu system of Quip time, find the references and undo it.
[00:49:24.860 --> 00:49:25.860]   - I don't know.
[00:49:25.860 --> 00:49:28.860]   - But why give me that thing during the install that gives me the impression that it would--
[00:49:28.860 --> 00:49:29.860]   - It's just a story.
[00:49:29.860 --> 00:49:30.860]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:49:30.860 --> 00:49:31.860]   It's like, well, you know, Quip time back.
[00:49:31.860 --> 00:49:33.860]   - Like the button that doesn't do anything.
[00:49:33.860 --> 00:49:35.860]   - That's an interesting Skype story as well.
[00:49:35.860 --> 00:49:37.860]   Intel apparently has done a deal with--
[00:49:37.860 --> 00:49:38.860]   - Oh, yeah, right.
[00:49:38.860 --> 00:49:39.860]   In fact, I thought, yeah, I--
[00:49:39.860 --> 00:49:40.860]   - A lockout, right?
[00:49:40.860 --> 00:49:41.860]   The conference limiting?
[00:49:41.860 --> 00:49:42.860]   - This is a bad idea.
[00:49:42.860 --> 00:49:47.860]   - So Skype currently is limited to five people in a conference, the host and four others.
[00:49:47.860 --> 00:49:49.860]   That's why we have five people on Twitch.
[00:49:49.860 --> 00:49:50.860]   In theory, you could do a lot more.
[00:49:50.860 --> 00:49:52.860]   In fact, there's one service that allows you to do 500.
[00:49:52.860 --> 00:49:55.860]   Now, bandwidth is going to be an issue at that point.
[00:49:55.860 --> 00:50:00.860]   But with the new Skype, you can get up to 10, but only if you're using an Intel processor.
[00:50:00.860 --> 00:50:05.860]   - Yeah, it's going to check the CPU ID on startup, because it's going to do a file somewhere
[00:50:05.860 --> 00:50:07.860]   that just looks at--ah, that's an AMD chip.
[00:50:07.860 --> 00:50:08.860]   Sorry, it's not going to work.
[00:50:08.860 --> 00:50:09.860]   - There's no technical reason for that.
[00:50:09.860 --> 00:50:11.860]   - This is a ridiculous situation.
[00:50:11.860 --> 00:50:16.860]   In fact, these people should be ashamed of themselves, both Intel and Skype for doing this deal.
[00:50:16.860 --> 00:50:18.860]   - I expected of Skype, and I don't blame Skype.
[00:50:18.860 --> 00:50:19.860]   - I do.
[00:50:19.860 --> 00:50:20.860]   - Well, it's eBay, right?
[00:50:20.860 --> 00:50:21.860]   Yeah, but what is it?
[00:50:21.860 --> 00:50:23.860]   - What's the point?
[00:50:23.860 --> 00:50:27.860]   And the other thing is, how long do you think a workaround is not going to be created to fix this problem?
[00:50:27.860 --> 00:50:29.860]   - Well, if I'm an AMD user, I use Gizmo.
[00:50:29.860 --> 00:50:30.860]   Screw that.
[00:50:30.860 --> 00:50:31.860]   - Alternative services.
[00:50:31.860 --> 00:50:33.860]   - There's a lot of common attractive.
[00:50:33.860 --> 00:50:38.860]   - Maybe they just look at enterprise users where people have to replace a bunch of--
[00:50:38.860 --> 00:50:41.860]   - Well, are they making the claim that, well, Intel's SSE is better?
[00:50:41.860 --> 00:50:42.860]   - No, they're not.
[00:50:42.860 --> 00:50:47.860]   The whole thing is, it's got nothing to do with anything except it's just a sweet deal.
[00:50:47.860 --> 00:50:49.860]   So I guess they threw a bunch of money at them or something.
[00:50:49.860 --> 00:50:51.860]   There had to be some money going on.
[00:50:51.860 --> 00:50:52.860]   - I think that's--yeah.
[00:50:52.860 --> 00:50:53.860]   - But it's sleazy.
[00:50:53.860 --> 00:50:54.860]   - It's a profit thing.
[00:50:54.860 --> 00:50:55.860]   - It's sleazy.
[00:50:55.860 --> 00:50:56.860]   - Yeah.
[00:50:56.860 --> 00:50:57.860]   - I moved AMD.
[00:50:57.860 --> 00:50:58.860]   Not looking back any time soon.
[00:50:58.860 --> 00:51:03.860]   - Fox has shipped a root kit with Mr. and Mrs. Smith on the DVD.
[00:51:03.860 --> 00:51:05.860]   Only in Europe, though, we don't have to worry about it here.
[00:51:05.860 --> 00:51:06.860]   - Germany, right?
[00:51:06.860 --> 00:51:07.860]   - Germany.
[00:51:07.860 --> 00:51:08.860]   - I don't know what the root kits--
[00:51:08.860 --> 00:51:10.860]   - Most of the black sights are in German.
[00:51:10.860 --> 00:51:11.860]   - It's a copy protection.
[00:51:11.860 --> 00:51:12.860]   - It's not works, but--
[00:51:12.860 --> 00:51:15.860]   - Oh, the root kit replaces--is it a root kit?
[00:51:15.860 --> 00:51:17.860]   - It's a cloaking mechanism.
[00:51:17.860 --> 00:51:19.860]   So I think maybe calling it a root kit is a little bit--
[00:51:19.860 --> 00:51:20.860]   - Loking device.
[00:51:20.860 --> 00:51:25.860]   - A little bit much because it doesn't hide files or registry entries.
[00:51:25.860 --> 00:51:26.860]   It merely hides the process.
[00:51:26.860 --> 00:51:30.860]   So when you hit control, all delete, you can't see that the copy protection is running.
[00:51:30.860 --> 00:51:31.860]   But files aren't hidden.
[00:51:31.860 --> 00:51:34.860]   - Telling you that autoplay feature on Windows system is probably one of the second evil
[00:51:34.860 --> 00:51:36.860]   things about that entire--it's hold down the shift key.
[00:51:36.860 --> 00:51:37.860]   - And bypasses it.
[00:51:37.860 --> 00:51:38.860]   - Turn it off.
[00:51:38.860 --> 00:51:39.860]   - You insert a disc.
[00:51:39.860 --> 00:51:40.860]   - Yeah.
[00:51:40.860 --> 00:51:41.860]   - Just hold down the shift key.
[00:51:41.860 --> 00:51:42.860]   - Turn off the elbow run.
[00:51:42.860 --> 00:51:43.860]   - Yeah.
[00:51:43.860 --> 00:51:44.860]   - Turn it off.
[00:51:44.860 --> 00:51:45.860]   - Yeah, you know what?
[00:51:45.860 --> 00:51:46.860]   I guess it is.
[00:51:46.860 --> 00:51:47.860]   - If you're going to play CDs or DVDs, just turn it off.
[00:51:47.860 --> 00:51:48.860]   - You don't need it.
[00:51:48.860 --> 00:51:49.860]   - Yeah.
[00:51:49.860 --> 00:51:50.860]   - Because what every DVD has--
[00:51:50.860 --> 00:51:51.860]   - An actual player?
[00:51:51.860 --> 00:51:52.860]   - Yeah.
[00:51:52.860 --> 00:51:53.860]   - Yeah.
[00:51:53.860 --> 00:51:54.860]   - A piece of garbage.
[00:51:54.860 --> 00:51:55.860]   - Complete garbage.
[00:51:55.860 --> 00:51:56.860]   - Well, and it looks for things like--
[00:51:56.860 --> 00:51:57.860]   - What the show's turned negatives.
[00:51:57.860 --> 00:51:58.860]   - Alcohol.
[00:51:58.860 --> 00:51:59.860]   - Alcohol.
[00:51:59.860 --> 00:52:00.860]   Alcohol's updated recently.
[00:52:00.860 --> 00:52:03.860]   They've got a brand new virtual drive that I haven't had any problems with any of the
[00:52:03.860 --> 00:52:04.860]   new copy protection.
[00:52:04.860 --> 00:52:07.860]   - Ooh, although some of the new copy protections have one copy though.
[00:52:07.860 --> 00:52:08.860]   - Here's a happy--
[00:52:08.860 --> 00:52:09.860]   - That's the thing.
[00:52:09.860 --> 00:52:11.860]   All the new copy protections are currently breaking alcohol, which I used to--
[00:52:11.860 --> 00:52:12.860]   - What's the--
[00:52:12.860 --> 00:52:15.860]   - I just don't want to put the disc in every time I'm switching between three different
[00:52:15.860 --> 00:52:16.860]   games.
[00:52:16.860 --> 00:52:17.860]   That's the problem I run into.
[00:52:17.860 --> 00:52:20.860]   I used to have three optical drives in my system for that problem, but now I have a new system
[00:52:20.860 --> 00:52:21.860]   with just one.
[00:52:21.860 --> 00:52:23.860]   I used to make virtual drives and just mount the images.
[00:52:23.860 --> 00:52:24.860]   - Yeah.
[00:52:24.860 --> 00:52:27.860]   - But most of these new copy protections now just refuse to work off of any kind of virtual
[00:52:27.860 --> 00:52:28.860]   drive.
[00:52:28.860 --> 00:52:29.860]   - You can have happy stories.
[00:52:29.860 --> 00:52:30.860]   - They're hacks for that, but--
[00:52:30.860 --> 00:52:31.860]   - Happy story.
[00:52:31.860 --> 00:52:32.860]   - Happy story.
[00:52:32.860 --> 00:52:33.860]   - Hookers.
[00:52:33.860 --> 00:52:34.860]   - I have more stories about a hookers.
[00:52:34.860 --> 00:52:35.860]   - Don't let your kids buy--
[00:52:35.860 --> 00:52:36.860]   - Professionals.
[00:52:36.860 --> 00:52:37.860]   - Brand theft auto.
[00:52:37.860 --> 00:52:38.860]   - Oh, yeah, because--
[00:52:38.860 --> 00:52:41.860]   - Is there an app surgeon hookers getting beat up by--
[00:52:41.860 --> 00:52:44.860]   - I think the term is correct, term is prostitute.
[00:52:44.860 --> 00:52:47.860]   - That's what they call themselves sex workers, actually.
[00:52:47.860 --> 00:52:48.860]   - Sex workers, who we should call them.
[00:52:48.860 --> 00:52:52.860]   - The site is SWAP USA, Sex Workers Outreach Project USA.
[00:52:52.860 --> 00:52:59.580]   They're asking parents to assist them in calling for a ban on the game because it promotes
[00:52:59.580 --> 00:53:02.460]   violence against sex workers.
[00:53:02.460 --> 00:53:03.460]   And everybody else.
[00:53:03.460 --> 00:53:04.460]   - Yeah.
[00:53:04.460 --> 00:53:05.460]   - That's the best--
[00:53:05.460 --> 00:53:06.460]   - That's so lame.
[00:53:06.460 --> 00:53:07.460]   - I think it's anybody.
[00:53:07.460 --> 00:53:09.460]   - Yeah, the cops get shocked and you get terrible.
[00:53:09.460 --> 00:53:13.860]   - Yeah, and I can ride a tricycle around for days on end.
[00:53:13.860 --> 00:53:15.460]   It's an open end sandbox.
[00:53:15.460 --> 00:53:16.460]   - You know, funny, my kid--
[00:53:16.460 --> 00:53:18.460]   - You can do anything in that game.
[00:53:18.460 --> 00:53:19.460]   - That's what my kid is saying.
[00:53:19.460 --> 00:53:21.260]   He's saying, "Dad, get me grand theft auto."
[00:53:21.260 --> 00:53:25.460]   And I promise what I'll do is I'll ride the bike out into the country and we'll just ride
[00:53:25.460 --> 00:53:26.460]   around.
[00:53:26.460 --> 00:53:27.460]   - You can't.
[00:53:27.460 --> 00:53:28.460]   - Yeah, you can.
[00:53:28.460 --> 00:53:29.460]   - But you think that's what he's going to do?
[00:53:29.460 --> 00:53:30.460]   - Yeah, I'll get it to them.
[00:53:30.460 --> 00:53:32.860]   - I like kids play with the low rider and have it hop in and cruising down the street.
[00:53:32.860 --> 00:53:33.860]   - You know, the thing is that--
[00:53:33.860 --> 00:53:34.860]   - With the gun out the side, just on this one.
[00:53:34.860 --> 00:53:37.980]   - The kids get bored with it and they go through this process.
[00:53:37.980 --> 00:53:38.980]   You should just let it happen.
[00:53:38.980 --> 00:53:41.260]   - Let it get through the system.
[00:53:41.260 --> 00:53:44.020]   - Look for the union label.
[00:53:44.020 --> 00:53:47.180]   - I'm disappointed in processes right now.
[00:53:47.180 --> 00:53:50.420]   That better not be the general opinion of all of them.
[00:53:50.420 --> 00:53:52.180]   That's a ignorant talk right there.
[00:53:52.180 --> 00:53:53.180]   - That's a bad video game.
[00:53:53.180 --> 00:53:54.180]   - Violence.
[00:53:54.180 --> 00:53:55.180]   - Pod fading.
[00:53:55.180 --> 00:53:56.420]   - Yeah, do you hear about that?
[00:53:56.420 --> 00:53:57.420]   - Yeah.
[00:53:57.420 --> 00:53:59.660]   - One guy stopped his pod case and asked big news.
[00:53:59.660 --> 00:54:00.660]   - Oh, yeah.
[00:54:00.660 --> 00:54:04.540]   - This is how overheated this whole podcasting thing has gotten.
[00:54:04.540 --> 00:54:06.060]   - You just can't sleep, ever.
[00:54:06.060 --> 00:54:08.060]   - I've been quoted just to keep you guys in the background.
[00:54:08.060 --> 00:54:10.060]   - The vlogger stopped the press.
[00:54:10.060 --> 00:54:12.620]   - It was a podcast about serenity, right?
[00:54:12.620 --> 00:54:13.620]   - Oh.
[00:54:13.620 --> 00:54:19.140]   - And they was a couple and they had some kids and they got a job and they said, "Well,
[00:54:19.140 --> 00:54:20.340]   we can't really do this anymore.
[00:54:20.340 --> 00:54:21.340]   Now it's pod fading."
[00:54:21.340 --> 00:54:22.340]   - Yeah.
[00:54:22.340 --> 00:54:23.340]   - Well, it was the official loss.
[00:54:23.340 --> 00:54:25.340]   - They're not the official, but the loss--
[00:54:25.340 --> 00:54:26.340]   - They could too.
[00:54:26.340 --> 00:54:27.540]   - They had to quit because of their jobs too.
[00:54:27.540 --> 00:54:28.540]   So maybe that's part of the--
[00:54:28.540 --> 00:54:29.540]   - So we're about to work for a living.
[00:54:29.540 --> 00:54:30.540]   - Do we have jobs?
[00:54:30.540 --> 00:54:31.540]   Why?
[00:54:31.540 --> 00:54:32.540]   What is the deal?
[00:54:32.540 --> 00:54:34.060]   - You're the one that gets to put the podcast together.
[00:54:34.060 --> 00:54:35.220]   You're obviously unemployed.
[00:54:35.220 --> 00:54:36.580]   - I am basically unemployed.
[00:54:36.580 --> 00:54:37.820]   - He's self-employed.
[00:54:37.820 --> 00:54:39.940]   - I do a podcast with Roger on Sundays just for the--
[00:54:39.940 --> 00:54:41.860]   - We're all self-employed.
[00:54:41.860 --> 00:54:43.380]   - A message has been handed to me.
[00:54:43.380 --> 00:54:44.380]   - Oh.
[00:54:44.380 --> 00:54:45.380]   - At the end.
[00:54:45.380 --> 00:54:48.980]   - Oh, we have to thank Adolph Gasser Studios in San Francisco.
[00:54:48.980 --> 00:54:49.980]   That's where we are today.
[00:54:49.980 --> 00:54:50.980]   - Ah, right.
[00:54:50.980 --> 00:54:55.060]   - Gasser, probably one of the best-name camera and photography companies in the world.
[00:54:55.060 --> 00:54:56.060]   - It's a pretty spectacular--
[00:54:56.060 --> 00:54:57.900]   - And video accessories is great.
[00:54:57.900 --> 00:55:00.380]   We got our cameras at Gasser's, right?
[00:55:00.380 --> 00:55:02.100]   And we buy a lot of equipment from them.
[00:55:02.100 --> 00:55:03.940]   - Yeah, they'd supply the pros.
[00:55:03.940 --> 00:55:07.260]   - They supply the pros and us, which is pretty amazing.
[00:55:07.260 --> 00:55:08.660]   I think I don't have anything else.
[00:55:08.660 --> 00:55:10.260]   I mean, there were a lot of other stories.
[00:55:10.260 --> 00:55:13.420]   - Well, there's the Duch cartoon thing, you know.
[00:55:13.420 --> 00:55:14.420]   - Duch is Danish?
[00:55:14.420 --> 00:55:15.420]   - Danish, what am I saying?
[00:55:15.420 --> 00:55:16.420]   - That thing is--
[00:55:16.420 --> 00:55:17.420]   - That thing is--
[00:55:17.420 --> 00:55:18.420]   - That's a tech story.
[00:55:18.420 --> 00:55:19.420]   - That's a terrible story.
[00:55:19.420 --> 00:55:20.420]   It's just crazy.
[00:55:20.420 --> 00:55:21.420]   - It's not a tech story.
[00:55:21.420 --> 00:55:24.100]   - I do think it's interesting that Halo 2 will only ship on Vista, not on XP.
[00:55:24.100 --> 00:55:25.100]   Who cares?
[00:55:25.100 --> 00:55:26.100]   Okay, I don't either.
[00:55:26.100 --> 00:55:27.100]   - Direct TV on the X360.
[00:55:27.100 --> 00:55:28.540]   - Let's see something new game.
[00:55:28.540 --> 00:55:29.820]   - I'm just looking at the list here.
[00:55:29.820 --> 00:55:34.300]   - There's some Ars Technica article saying that they found a tab reserved for Direct TV
[00:55:34.300 --> 00:55:35.300]   in the X360.
[00:55:35.300 --> 00:55:36.300]   - Oh, yeah.
[00:55:36.300 --> 00:55:37.540]   - I got to deal with Microsoft for only.
[00:55:37.540 --> 00:55:39.420]   - I just hooked up that media connect.
[00:55:39.420 --> 00:55:43.140]   - That's so I can do my media center PC to the Xbox now on stream stuff, back and forth.
[00:55:43.140 --> 00:55:44.140]   - I'm starting to dig in.
[00:55:44.140 --> 00:55:45.140]   - Makes sense, though.
[00:55:45.140 --> 00:55:47.740]   - It's like every science fiction book ever written.
[00:55:47.740 --> 00:55:49.740]   There's only gonna be two companies in the world.
[00:55:49.740 --> 00:55:52.020]   And every restaurant will be Taco Bell.
[00:55:52.020 --> 00:55:53.180]   - I'm sorry, I called it a tab.
[00:55:53.180 --> 00:55:54.180]   It's a blade, right?
[00:55:54.180 --> 00:55:55.180]   - It's a blade.
[00:55:55.180 --> 00:55:56.180]   - It's a blade, yeah.
[00:55:56.180 --> 00:55:58.060]   - Oh, I can't wait for the PS3, though.
[00:55:58.060 --> 00:55:59.060]   I'm not buying the Xbox.
[00:55:59.060 --> 00:56:00.060]   - Those games, funs, uh-huh.
[00:56:00.060 --> 00:56:01.060]   - The first one.
[00:56:01.060 --> 00:56:02.060]   - The first one is gonna get you.
[00:56:02.060 --> 00:56:03.060]   - I just wanna see it.
[00:56:03.060 --> 00:56:04.060]   - I like the Xbox.
[00:56:04.060 --> 00:56:05.060]   I already the Xbox 360.
[00:56:05.060 --> 00:56:06.060]   I think it's cool.
[00:56:06.060 --> 00:56:07.060]   - You love it.
[00:56:07.060 --> 00:56:08.060]   - You both love it.
[00:56:08.060 --> 00:56:09.060]   - I don't like it.
[00:56:09.060 --> 00:56:10.060]   - I don't like it.
[00:56:10.060 --> 00:56:11.060]   - I just wanna get a noisy one, I guess.
[00:56:11.060 --> 00:56:12.060]   - You're like, "What?
[00:56:12.060 --> 00:56:13.060]   Your power, cool."
[00:56:13.060 --> 00:56:14.540]   - No, I mean, it's louder than the TV.
[00:56:14.540 --> 00:56:17.460]   I have a rear projection with a pretty good fan in it, and it's like, it's louder than
[00:56:17.460 --> 00:56:18.460]   that.
[00:56:18.460 --> 00:56:19.460]   - What do you want?
[00:56:19.460 --> 00:56:20.460]   - TV projectors are loud.
[00:56:20.460 --> 00:56:27.860]   - You'll be able to run a Vista, or you at least won't get this Euroglass unless you
[00:56:27.860 --> 00:56:34.060]   have a DirectX 9C video card, but that's not all video cards, not even most video cards,
[00:56:34.060 --> 00:56:35.060]   right?
[00:56:35.060 --> 00:56:38.620]   - All current video cards, all the current high-end, anything, any of the latest generation
[00:56:38.620 --> 00:56:42.300]   from any video or ATI, any of the last two generations would support that.
[00:56:42.300 --> 00:56:46.820]   The bigger issue is HDCP support, the high bandwidth copy protection system that they
[00:56:46.820 --> 00:56:47.820]   use.
[00:56:47.820 --> 00:56:53.020]   Right now, you cannot build a system that will support the full resolution of Blu-ray or HDVD
[00:56:53.020 --> 00:56:54.020]   when it ships.
[00:56:54.020 --> 00:56:57.220]   You're gonna be basically forced to down-resit because no current card supports.
[00:56:57.220 --> 00:56:58.860]   - So if you were gonna build a cryptid output--
[00:56:58.860 --> 00:57:02.140]   - A machine for Vista and you plan to play high-res DVDs or--
[00:57:02.140 --> 00:57:03.140]   - Yeah.
[00:57:03.140 --> 00:57:04.140]   - You'll have all current video cards you should not--
[00:57:04.140 --> 00:57:05.140]   - No.
[00:57:05.140 --> 00:57:06.300]   - Will not provide that full resolution support.
[00:57:06.300 --> 00:57:10.460]   - When you were explaining to me, some of them say they have HDCP support and they don't.
[00:57:10.460 --> 00:57:11.460]   - They've been--
[00:57:11.460 --> 00:57:15.100]   ATI has a couple of cards that have been listed on their page, old cards too that say HDCP
[00:57:15.100 --> 00:57:19.020]   supported, yes, I guess technically you could, but there's physically no encryption chip
[00:57:19.020 --> 00:57:22.460]   on there with the unique key that identifies that card that can make the handshake with
[00:57:22.460 --> 00:57:23.460]   another HDCP display.
[00:57:23.460 --> 00:57:26.940]   - So they support HDCP, they just don't support unencrypted.
[00:57:26.940 --> 00:57:27.940]   - It doesn't work.
[00:57:27.940 --> 00:57:29.940]   - The one that doesn't work.
[00:57:29.940 --> 00:57:30.940]   - The one that doesn't work.
[00:57:30.940 --> 00:57:34.860]   - It requires adding a chip and I think they should just confuse the situation further by
[00:57:34.860 --> 00:57:36.260]   just saying they're HDCP ready.
[00:57:36.260 --> 00:57:40.620]   - Yeah, they work for a TV manufacturer for over the years.
[00:57:40.620 --> 00:57:42.500]   - Yeah, you know what?
[00:57:42.500 --> 00:57:46.040]   It also depends on how soon there's really no reason to have at this point to have an
[00:57:46.040 --> 00:57:49.860]   HDCP enabled video card on a computer because there's nothing we can currently use it with,
[00:57:49.860 --> 00:57:54.820]   but in the next few months, if the timelines are holding right, we'll have the PC drives
[00:57:54.820 --> 00:57:56.340]   for Blu-ray.
[00:57:56.340 --> 00:57:57.820]   They were saying March, I don't know.
[00:57:57.820 --> 00:57:58.820]   - Yeah, you get a gorgeous--
[00:57:58.820 --> 00:58:02.580]   - What's the solitaire game guess you do?
[00:58:02.580 --> 00:58:03.780]   - See, I didn't see this one, no.
[00:58:03.780 --> 00:58:07.500]   - The mayor of New York City, Michael Bloomberg's walking through the legislative offices of
[00:58:07.500 --> 00:58:12.420]   Albany for the city and he's getting a tour and an office assistant, Ed Green, who's
[00:58:12.420 --> 00:58:13.420]   the ninth, the ninth.
[00:58:13.420 --> 00:58:14.420]   - The ninth, wow.
[00:58:14.420 --> 00:58:15.420]   - That's what it says here.
[00:58:15.420 --> 00:58:16.420]   - I had no idea.
[00:58:16.420 --> 00:58:21.100]   - I don't even know, I X, you ever see I X after her name?
[00:58:21.100 --> 00:58:22.100]   Maybe that's his last name is Ix.
[00:58:22.100 --> 00:58:26.100]   I don't know if Ed Greenwood Ix was going over some papers as a desk.
[00:58:26.100 --> 00:58:29.140]   The mayor comes over, they pose with a photographer for a picture.
[00:58:29.140 --> 00:58:33.140]   The mayor looks at his desk, he's running solitaire on the computer.
[00:58:33.140 --> 00:58:36.300]   The mayor leaves, calls the boss at the office.
[00:58:36.300 --> 00:58:37.300]   - Yeah, this guy's a jerk.
[00:58:37.300 --> 00:58:38.300]   - Fire this guy.
[00:58:38.300 --> 00:58:39.300]   - Bloomberg's a jerk.
[00:58:39.300 --> 00:58:41.500]   - That's so 1950s like gangster movies.
[00:58:41.500 --> 00:58:44.980]   - He's been playing solitaire.
[00:58:44.980 --> 00:58:48.860]   The guy, Greenwood Ix, earned 27,000 a year.
[00:58:48.860 --> 00:58:49.860]   - Oh please.
[00:58:49.860 --> 00:58:50.860]   - He's been working there for seven years.
[00:58:50.860 --> 00:58:51.860]   - He lives in New York.
[00:58:51.860 --> 00:58:52.860]   How does he get forward?
[00:58:52.860 --> 00:58:54.660]   - He's like to be fired, no, he's up in Albany.
[00:58:54.660 --> 00:58:55.660]   - Well, still.
[00:58:55.660 --> 00:58:56.660]   - He was lucky he was fired.
[00:58:56.660 --> 00:58:57.660]   He's been working there for six years.
[00:58:57.660 --> 00:58:58.660]   - How old was he?
[00:58:58.660 --> 00:59:02.140]   - He says, I don't know, he says in a telephone interview, he limited his playtime to his
[00:59:02.140 --> 00:59:07.340]   one hour lunch break or during quick breaks when he needed a moment of distraction.
[00:59:07.340 --> 00:59:08.940]   - Well that's a lie, but it's a good lie.
[00:59:08.940 --> 00:59:09.940]   - No, you know what, it's probably...
[00:59:09.940 --> 00:59:12.620]   - It could be fully straight in here.
[00:59:12.620 --> 00:59:14.420]   - He's just playing some slime.
[00:59:14.420 --> 00:59:18.980]   - The idea that you can work every minute of your work day for nine until five is a bad
[00:59:18.980 --> 00:59:19.980]   idea.
[00:59:19.980 --> 00:59:21.540]   People won't be productive if you make them do this.
[00:59:21.540 --> 00:59:22.540]   - This poor guy.
[00:59:22.540 --> 00:59:24.500]   - Someone, he's got a kid, a toddler, baby.
[00:59:24.500 --> 00:59:28.580]   - Someone should go to Mayor Bloomberg's office, see what the hell's on his desktop running.
[00:59:28.580 --> 00:59:30.580]   - Or he probably can't even use a computer.
[00:59:30.580 --> 00:59:31.580]   - Tetris.
[00:59:31.580 --> 00:59:32.580]   - Bloomberg and his computer.
[00:59:32.580 --> 00:59:33.580]   - It's probably a planner.
[00:59:33.580 --> 00:59:34.580]   - Michael Bloomberg.
[00:59:34.580 --> 00:59:35.580]   - It's a myth.
[00:59:35.580 --> 00:59:36.580]   - You don't think he's like, I mean this was the most...
[00:59:36.580 --> 00:59:38.980]   - I believe, you know, he has a company.
[00:59:38.980 --> 00:59:42.580]   I mean it's like a couple of guys that finished Conner, you know, these guys who did the
[00:59:42.580 --> 00:59:43.580]   hard...
[00:59:43.580 --> 00:59:46.580]   They didn't use computers, they were just manufacturers, you know.
[00:59:46.580 --> 00:59:50.020]   - Well it's like those guys, the executive producers of the Oxygen shows back when it
[00:59:50.020 --> 00:59:53.820]   was this great big integrated network they had their assistants print out their emails
[00:59:53.820 --> 00:59:54.820]   for them.
[00:59:54.820 --> 00:59:55.820]   - Yeah.
[00:59:55.820 --> 00:59:57.300]   - You know, this was in the .com boom day.
[00:59:57.300 --> 01:00:00.140]   - Oxygen, another Paul Allen at the adventure.
[01:00:00.140 --> 01:00:01.140]   - Oh, fuck.
[01:00:01.140 --> 01:00:02.140]   - Oh god.
[01:00:02.140 --> 01:00:05.660]   - Microsoft's anti-spyware program uninstalls Norton Antifire.
[01:00:05.660 --> 01:00:06.660]   - Well it does, unfortunately.
[01:00:06.660 --> 01:00:07.660]   - Well it does, unfortunately.
[01:00:07.660 --> 01:00:10.260]   It doesn't even do a good job of it.
[01:00:10.260 --> 01:00:13.780]   It just messes up the registries so you can't fix it.
[01:00:13.780 --> 01:00:14.780]   - Oh, that's not...
[01:00:14.780 --> 01:00:15.780]   - It's brilliant.
[01:00:15.780 --> 01:00:16.780]   - Oh, anybody...
[01:00:16.780 --> 01:00:18.900]   - So they botched the only good thing they tried to do.
[01:00:18.900 --> 01:00:20.620]   - It's hard to uninstall Norton, actually.
[01:00:20.620 --> 01:00:21.620]   - Yeah, it's really...
[01:00:21.620 --> 01:00:22.620]   It's one of those programs you...
[01:00:22.620 --> 01:00:24.980]   - Even somebody said somebody sent me a white program but I'm not gonna...
[01:00:24.980 --> 01:00:26.980]   - It's a honest mistake that they call it spyware.
[01:00:26.980 --> 01:00:27.980]   It's a malware.
[01:00:27.980 --> 01:00:31.620]   - I don't know what the deal is.
[01:00:31.620 --> 01:00:34.620]   According to Microsoft, it's, hey it's a beta.
[01:00:34.620 --> 01:00:36.140]   - Hey it's a beta.
[01:00:36.140 --> 01:00:37.140]   - It's a beta.
[01:00:37.140 --> 01:00:38.140]   - It's a beta.
[01:00:38.140 --> 01:00:39.140]   - Google defense.
[01:00:39.140 --> 01:00:41.340]   - Yeah, we were supposed to get a lot more but you know...
[01:00:41.340 --> 01:00:42.340]   - Is Gmail still beta?
[01:00:42.340 --> 01:00:43.340]   - Yeah.
[01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:44.340]   - Yeah.
[01:00:44.340 --> 01:00:45.340]   - What else is Skype is beta?
[01:00:45.340 --> 01:00:46.340]   - And they got scholar.
[01:00:46.340 --> 01:00:47.340]   Have you seen that?
[01:00:47.340 --> 01:00:48.340]   - You know why?
[01:00:48.340 --> 01:00:49.340]   It's a new one.
[01:00:49.340 --> 01:00:50.340]   - Oh yeah.
[01:00:50.340 --> 01:00:51.340]   - You see scholars, it looks up...
[01:00:51.340 --> 01:00:55.220]   In fact it's pretty, it's actually almost useless but it looks up all these scholarly
[01:00:55.220 --> 01:00:57.340]   papers that you have to pay for.
[01:00:57.340 --> 01:01:01.020]   I mean you find all these papers because it's all these weird sites and they have all this
[01:01:01.020 --> 01:01:03.140]   cool stuff on there but then you can't read any of it.
[01:01:03.140 --> 01:01:05.020]   You can get to the abstracts usually.
[01:01:05.020 --> 01:01:08.540]   I was looking something up the other day and I ran into the beta of Google Scholar.
[01:01:08.540 --> 01:01:09.540]   - That's a good idea.
[01:01:09.540 --> 01:01:10.540]   - It's a good idea.
[01:01:10.540 --> 01:01:11.540]   - It's a good idea.
[01:01:11.540 --> 01:01:12.540]   - It's a good idea.
[01:01:12.540 --> 01:01:13.540]   - It's a good idea.
[01:01:13.540 --> 01:01:14.540]   - It's a good idea.
[01:01:14.540 --> 01:01:15.540]   - It's a good idea.
[01:01:15.540 --> 01:01:16.540]   - It's a good idea.
[01:01:16.540 --> 01:01:17.540]   - It's a good idea.
[01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:18.540]   - It's a good idea.
[01:01:18.540 --> 01:01:19.540]   - It's a good idea.
[01:01:19.540 --> 01:01:20.540]   - It's a good idea.
[01:01:20.540 --> 01:01:21.540]   - It's a good idea.
[01:01:21.540 --> 01:01:22.540]   - It's a good idea.
[01:01:22.540 --> 01:01:23.540]   - It's a good idea.
[01:01:23.540 --> 01:01:24.540]   - It's a good idea.
[01:01:24.540 --> 01:01:25.540]   - It's a good idea.
[01:01:25.540 --> 01:01:26.540]   - It's a good idea.
[01:01:26.540 --> 01:01:27.540]   - It's a good idea.
[01:01:27.540 --> 01:01:28.540]   - It's a good idea.
[01:01:28.540 --> 01:01:29.540]   - It's a good idea.
[01:01:29.540 --> 01:01:30.540]   - It's a good idea.
[01:01:30.540 --> 01:01:37.540]   - Google, what's your target price now?
[01:01:37.540 --> 01:01:38.540]   - Same 500.
[01:01:38.540 --> 01:01:39.540]   - It's got some profit taking.
[01:01:39.540 --> 01:01:40.540]   Come on.
[01:01:40.540 --> 01:01:41.540]   - It was up yesterday.
[01:01:41.540 --> 01:01:42.540]   I noticed it was up a little bit.
[01:01:42.540 --> 01:01:43.540]   - It'll get back to on track.
[01:01:43.540 --> 01:01:44.540]   I think it only needs one--
[01:01:44.540 --> 01:01:45.540]   - Is Google evil?
[01:01:45.540 --> 01:01:46.540]   - Two good quarters in a row.
[01:01:46.540 --> 01:01:47.540]   - I think they're evil now.
[01:01:47.540 --> 01:01:48.540]   - Why?
[01:01:48.540 --> 01:01:49.540]   You do not.
[01:01:49.540 --> 01:01:50.540]   - I think they're not stuffer.
[01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:51.540]   They're now evil.
[01:01:51.540 --> 01:01:52.540]   - This is bull.
[01:01:52.540 --> 01:01:53.540]   - All right.
[01:01:53.540 --> 01:01:57.700]   We actually tried to go through two weeks worth of news in one show and I think we're probably
[01:01:57.700 --> 01:01:59.180]   running out of time here.
[01:01:59.180 --> 01:02:01.180]   I want to thank everybody for showing up.
[01:02:01.180 --> 01:02:02.180]   It's nice to see you.
[01:02:02.180 --> 01:02:03.180]   Tom Merritt, please come back.
[01:02:03.180 --> 01:02:04.180]   - Yeah, thanks for having us.
[01:02:04.180 --> 01:02:05.180]   - And send Molly over to--
[01:02:05.180 --> 01:02:06.180]   - Road to--
[01:02:06.180 --> 01:02:07.180]   - --from CNET's Buzz Out Loud.
[01:02:07.180 --> 01:02:09.180]   - That's the right-- that's the Buzz Out Loud.
[01:02:09.180 --> 01:02:10.180]   - Buzz Out Loud.
[01:02:10.180 --> 01:02:12.180]   - She does, of course, anchor desk, which is--
[01:02:12.180 --> 01:02:13.180]   - Well, she does the Buzz Report.
[01:02:13.180 --> 01:02:14.180]   - The Buzz Report, I'm sorry.
[01:02:14.180 --> 01:02:16.180]   - Yeah, Rafe Needleman Nunn does anchor desk.
[01:02:16.180 --> 01:02:17.180]   - Oh, it's Rafe Needleman.
[01:02:17.180 --> 01:02:18.180]   - Oh, Rafe's great.
[01:02:18.180 --> 01:02:19.180]   I love Rafe.
[01:02:19.180 --> 01:02:20.180]   - We should have him on too.
[01:02:20.180 --> 01:02:21.180]   - Yeah, you should.
[01:02:21.180 --> 01:02:22.180]   - And Tom, of course, is over there at CNET too.
[01:02:22.180 --> 01:02:23.180]   It does a great job.
[01:02:23.180 --> 01:02:30.180]   - Roger now is employed.
[01:02:30.180 --> 01:02:31.180]   - Yes.
[01:02:31.180 --> 01:02:34.180]   - And we're glad to see that with DLTV as is Robert Herron.
[01:02:34.180 --> 01:02:35.180]   - Yeah.
[01:02:35.180 --> 01:02:36.180]   - Pretty soon we're going to be outnumbered here
[01:02:36.180 --> 01:02:37.180]   by the DLTV crew.
[01:02:37.180 --> 01:02:38.180]   - It's growing.
[01:02:38.180 --> 01:02:40.180]   - John C. Dvorak, Dvorak.org/blog.
[01:02:40.180 --> 01:02:41.180]   Patrick couldn't be here.
[01:02:41.180 --> 01:02:44.180]   He wasn't a little under the weather, so get well sewn, Patrick.
[01:02:44.180 --> 01:02:48.180]   And I guess we want to thank our friends at AOL Radio
[01:02:48.180 --> 01:02:51.180]   for providing us with a band with them posting this show on their
[01:02:51.180 --> 01:02:52.180]   podcast channel.
[01:02:52.180 --> 01:02:54.180]   - I'm going to be on the blog going to check it out there.
[01:02:54.180 --> 01:02:56.180]   - I'm not even going to get paid for this.
[01:02:56.180 --> 01:02:58.180]   - We got to start getting paid for this.
[01:02:58.180 --> 01:02:59.180]   - We're thinking about it.
[01:02:59.180 --> 01:03:01.180]   Actually, there's a big meeting in New York.
[01:03:01.180 --> 01:03:02.180]   - Big meeting.
[01:03:02.180 --> 01:03:03.180]   - One of some of us are going to go there.
[01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:05.180]   We're supposed to tape something for that big meeting.
[01:03:05.180 --> 01:03:06.180]   We'll tape something.
[01:03:06.180 --> 01:03:07.180]   - Yeah.
[01:03:07.180 --> 01:03:09.180]   - But for now, it's time to be able to make sure that we're
