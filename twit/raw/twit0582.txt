[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.040]   I'm Becky Worley, stepping in for the Intrepid Leo
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.280]   report who is on a boat somewhere.
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.640]   I am ABC News technology and consumer correspondent,
[00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.480]   Good Morning, America, is where you see me most days,
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.000]   but when Uncle Leo hands over the keys to the news studio,
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.880]   oh, yeah, it is on.
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.720]   And I am joined by three fabulous people and monitors.
[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.120]   We shall start with Christina Warren, senior writer
[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.640]   at Gizmodo now.
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.760]   You've changed your course of action.
[00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.480]   Welcome, Christina.
[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.840]   Where are you?
[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.200]   You're in New York, right?
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.200]   I am in New York.
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.920]   All right.
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:16.440]   OK.
[00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.840]   Well, welcome.
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:18.840]   Thanks so much.
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.240]   Jason Heiner, you are here.
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.120]   You look like you're at a yoga retreat there.
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.920]   That photo is very-- where your backdrop is very calming.
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:26.520]   That's good.
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.960]   That's good.
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:27.800]   I'm working on that.
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:28.760]   I'm working on that.
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.080]   I saw that you were posting about the change
[00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.280]   to fall this week.
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.160]   Nature's finest.
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.200]   You is-- what is it?
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.200]   Uh-huh.
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.720]   Uh-huh.
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.680]   Robert Frost, poem, Nature's first screen is gold.
[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:40.200]   Ah.
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.680]   A hard speed to hold.
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.080]   Nothing gold can stay, but we've got some gold here.
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.040]   Nothing gold can stay.
[00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.920]   And beautiful.
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:46.520]   Yes.
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:47.120]   I love it.
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.000]   Fall is in the air.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.360]   Even here in California, there were these strange projectiles
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.080]   falling from the air as I was driving up here.
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.760]   And I had to switch on this new technical device that
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.440]   doesn't get used very much in California,
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.760]   where it removes the projectiles from the front
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.760]   of your windshield.
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:04.680]   And it was bizarre.
[00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.600]   Apparently, we had real rain in California today.
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.320]   So fall is here.
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.080]   In New Jersey--
[00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.640]   Everything is legal in New Jersey.
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:15.880]   Everything is legal in New Jersey.
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.280]   Are those things called windshield lasers?
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.160]   I think they combat bugs and splatter and things like that.
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.560]   Oh, Doctor.
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.240]   Owen JJ Stone in the heart with his lovely daughter
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.360]   in her soccer uniform coming in.
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.080]   He's in the midst of moving.
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.120]   I'm doing a show.
[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.400]   He's podcasting.
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.360]   He's parenting.
[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.280]   He's moving.
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.840]   The guy is amazing.
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.200]   Go watch your show.
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.200]   Don't be testing.
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:42.840]   Don't be testing.
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:43.480]   Go watch your show.
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:44.200]   You're done packing.
[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.040]   She's saying she's not going to ask me about tissues.
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.880]   Yes.
[00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:48.720]   I'm here.
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.160]   Oh, Doctor, technology.
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.920]   There's a drone.
[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.200]   It looks like a person, but that was my drone.
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:53.800]   That's right.
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.960]   We've got at oh, Doctor, his handle.
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.800]   And I forgot to mention Jason Heiner is from Tech Republic
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.200]   and many other cool projects.
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.160]   You guys, thanks so much for joining me today.
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.080]   Pleasure.
[00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.600]   I think we should just-- I think we should get right into it
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.600]   and talk about the big thing that we're expecting this week
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:16.360]   is Google's mystery not-so-mysterious event.
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:21.120]   It's happening on the fourth, which is Tuesday, I do believe.
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.880]   The expectation is that a couple new phones, Pixel and Pixel XL,
[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.360]   these aren't your Nexus type prototypes.
[00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.640]   We're not talking about guides for OEMs, competitors,
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.200]   to something Samsung might make.
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.720]   Let me-- I'll go through a couple of respects
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.640]   and then I want to hear what you guys think.
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:42.600]   Rumored to be built by HTC, 5 or 5 and 1/2 inch AMOLED
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:48.400]   displays, quad core 64-bit CPU, 4 gigs RAM,
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.560]   a 12 and 8 megapixel cameras, respectively.
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.040]   And this is the one-- it's rumored to cost about $650.
[00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.120]   Why do you guys think they're codenamed
[00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.040]   sailfish and Marlin?
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.640]   What?
[00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:04.480]   Oh, man.
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:07.520]   I stopped playing that game with codenames a long time ago.
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.560]   It was like--
[00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.040]   Till and look at all the ones that they
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.080]   used to have in the old days that made no sense.
[00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.600]   Yeah.
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:14.880]   Gallatin, remember those?
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.120]   Blowfish.
[00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.920]   Yeah.
[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.960]   Or remember back to when Mike--
[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.040]   Microsoft used to pick all those mountains.
[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.560]   It was all different mountains up in--
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:27.560]   Snow colony.
[00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:28.560]   And--
[00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:29.560]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:30.560]   Whistler.
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:31.560]   A lot of them were-- Whistler.
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:32.760]   Whistler was the big one.
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.960]   That was the codename for Vista.
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:35.880]   Ouch.
[00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.280]   They quit after that and can't blame them.
[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.200]   They have to be picking names out of a hat.
[00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.560]   Every employee gets a number and they pick a number out.
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.520]   And then that employee just gets to make name stuff.
[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:45.120]   Yells something.
[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.920]   Because he's a big fishing guy.
[00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:49.000]   Like, why else is that happening?
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.240]   There's no reason.
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:50.720]   Absolutely.
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:51.640]   They're like inside jokes.
[00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.920]   Yeah, so often they're like inside jokes for the team.
[00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:54.840]   It's kind of fun, though.
[00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:55.600]   It is fun.
[00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.720]   These are trophy fish, game fish.
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:58.640]   That's-- I don't know.
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:01.040]   I mean, maybe this signifies that they're actually
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.840]   entering into the competition here,
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:06.520]   that they're not just creating these as reference designs,
[00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.560]   that these are really phones that are competitive
[00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:10.040]   and they want to go after Samsung.
[00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.240]   Do Christina, does that make any sense to you?
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.720]   Yeah, and I mean, I think that the Nexus line has never
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.600]   been financially successful.
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:19.800]   It's always been loved by the fans and the hardcore Android
[00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.200]   geeks have really liked those phones.
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:23.000]   But it's not like they've ever sold well.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.320]   I mean, they used to actually--
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:25.600]   they tried to sell them in stores.
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:28.880]   And then even the carriers were like, yeah, actually no.
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.920]   So I mean, I think that this is their latest attempt.
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:33.360]   And they've tried this a number of other times
[00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.720]   with other stuff to kind of say, hey,
[00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:39.480]   we're tired of the way the OEMs are using our software
[00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.840]   or maybe not using it, not updating things as quickly
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:43.560]   as they should for both security updates
[00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:48.000]   and for the way that Google really wants Android
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:48.880]   to look and feel.
[00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:52.480]   And so why not kind of have a really polished product that
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:55.400]   can go head to head with those guys?
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:55.600]   So--
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:56.600]   So--
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:57.100]   Go on.
[00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:58.440]   What do you think?
[00:06:58.440 --> 00:06:59.760]   I think they should follow a model
[00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:01.880]   that I learned worked a long time ago.
[00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:07.920]   So long story short, NBA Live was one of the best basketball
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.520]   games available that you could play.
[00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:10.800]   Every console had it.
[00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.200]   It was number one selling.
[00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:15.600]   2K brand could not break it to the market and do anything.
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:17.560]   And what they did the one year, they just got tired
[00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:18.840]   of just losing money.
[00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:19.680]   They said, you know what?
[00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.920]   Here's the game for $19.99.
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:22.920]   We made a great game.
[00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:23.520]   We know it's great.
[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:24.880]   But you won't buy it because you're not
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:26.000]   going to spend $60.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.040]   But for $20, all the people that couldn't afford the $60
[00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:32.040]   game bought that $20 game.
[00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:32.880]   And it was amazing.
[00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:35.480]   And in the uproar of everyone playing it
[00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:38.840]   has now crushed NBA Live to where it went out of existence
[00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:40.440]   for three years and I was trying to come back.
[00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:42.000]   But it can't compete with 2K.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.760]   If you really wanted to get these phones and hands of people,
[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:47.520]   just bring the price down to a normal humanly rate price.
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:49.880]   And people would jump at the bit to get it.
[00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:51.200]   And then they would see the power
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:54.000]   that you have to push forward in a great device.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.040]   But you won't so you don't.
[00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:56.600]   So it won't end well.
[00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:58.800]   No, they tried that with Nexus though.
[00:07:58.800 --> 00:07:59.720]   They did try that.
[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:02.200]   You know, I mean, the last few Nexus's.
[00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:03.040]   They end the right--
[00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:04.160]   The end the right thing was point.
[00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:05.720]   I mean, I think that--
[00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:07.040]   because that's the weird position there.
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:08.040]   And right?
[00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:11.480]   They, on the one hand, even when they own Motorola,
[00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:13.320]   Google's always trying to play both sides of this.
[00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:15.040]   On the one hand, they made their own phones.
[00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:17.520]   On the other hand, they're saying, oh, but please don't fork us
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:18.520]   and then make your own thing.
[00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:20.480]   Because we love you, Samsung.
[00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:22.680]   We love you Huawei.
[00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:23.600]   We love UHGC.
[00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:25.360]   We love ULG.
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:26.840]   Don't leave us.
[00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:29.560]   But yet, they clearly want to be able to have their own phones.
[00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:30.600]   They can go head to head too.
[00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:33.080]   So they're in a weird position because you're right.
[00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:38.480]   I think especially when you look at these low-cost, high spec Chinese
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:44.120]   smartphones from OnePlus and from Xiaomi and people like that,
[00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:47.800]   Huawei, there's a potential market, especially
[00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:51.040]   on the Western world to say, we've got a phone like that
[00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:54.960]   that you can buy that is going to get all the updates from Google.
[00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:56.960]   But I think the risk they would take by doing that,
[00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:59.040]   if they did kind of go on and say, we're
[00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:00.640]   going to undercut everybody price-wise,
[00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:04.960]   is the people that are your partners might say, well,
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:08.120]   do we really want to work with you as closely?
[00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:10.440]   Or should we look at forking this?
[00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:11.840]   Because that's always the challenge.
[00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:13.480]   I mean, at this point, I think that the challenge
[00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:14.560]   will work as probably less.
[00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:16.480]   But you don't necessarily want people to say,
[00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:17.880]   we're going to do our own thing.
[00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:20.240]   You don't want Samsung to say, well, enough with you,
[00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:22.200]   we'll just build our own thing.
[00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:24.920]   Well, I'm not sure you really could compete on price, though.
[00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:29.080]   I mean, you look at OnePlus 3, that device is major.
[00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:34.600]   At 400 bucks, it's incredible what they've done.
[00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:38.600]   And then you look at Samsung, but they have all that.
[00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:39.880]   They're in China.
[00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:42.520]   They're embedded in that atmosphere
[00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:48.000]   where they can get really good access to low cost, high quality
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.160]   parts.
[00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:53.160]   Samsung, of course, because it has its own arm of these things
[00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:55.840]   where it makes them and then essentially sells them
[00:09:55.840 --> 00:10:00.120]   to themselves from their other business units, high quality
[00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:01.000]   at low cost.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.520]   It's just tough to get that thing much lower than that.
[00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:07.880]   And so I suspect that they're doing the opposite.
[00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:09.000]   I mean, I think you're right on.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.480]   I think that would be smart to do.
[00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:12.120]   I don't know that they can play that game.
[00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:14.200]   So I think they're trying to play the other game, which
[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:17.880]   is they're going to try to make a really high quality device
[00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:22.120]   sell it essentially at as low a price as they can to break
[00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:25.840]   even, but to really try to push Android, still try
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:27.680]   to push Android forward, not necessarily
[00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:29.360]   make a huge margin on that phone.
[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:32.120]   But I think at 650, they're probably
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:36.360]   selling it as low as they can to turn a little bit of a profit
[00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:38.640]   and put the super high-end hardware
[00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:42.840]   that they can to show what Android's really capable of.
[00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:44.400]   I mean, I think this thing better be good.
[00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:48.200]   It's big of the billboards they've been putting up in New York.
[00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:49.920]   This device better be good.
[00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:53.040]   I wrote about that last week, saying something
[00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:54.640]   they need to learn from Apple about hype.
[00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:57.880]   One of the reasons that the iPhone 7's been reviewed so well
[00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:01.120]   is Apple spent all year essentially
[00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:03.160]   tamping down expectations.
[00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:05.400]   Oh, it's not going to be redesigned.
[00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:07.480]   Oh, the new one's going to come next year,
[00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:09.080]   the 10-year anniversary.
[00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:11.000]   A lot of those were powered by what
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.520]   were very likely Apple leaks.
[00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:16.560]   So when this device did come out and all the sudden,
[00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:19.000]   the camera was a little better than what we thought.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.760]   The battery life was better than what we thought.
[00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:25.880]   Several other features were better than what we thought.
[00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:29.800]   All of a sudden, it's like, whoa, this device is a winner.
[00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:32.520]   And so Google's doing a little bit of the opposite with--
[00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:34.600]   they're sort of building up some hype for this device.
[00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:38.960]   And there's the thin line between creating interest and demand
[00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:41.880]   and sort of raising expectations to the point
[00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:43.320]   that people are going to go.
[00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:47.720]   If this thing doesn't look a lot better than the Galaxy Note
[00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:50.240]   7 or the OnePlus 3, all of a sudden, people
[00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:52.840]   are going to go, eh, it's just a nice Android phone.
[00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:54.320]   But it's an interesting tactic that's
[00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:55.880]   so different from what they've done in the past,
[00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:58.080]   because the Nexus has been so undersold.
[00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:00.000]   It's been so understated.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.160]   And it's really had that sort of, oh, this is a geek appeal only
[00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:06.960]   and we're not going to push it to the mainstream.
[00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:11.240]   Secondarily, what a great time to kick Samsung in the shins.
[00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:12.240]   Ooh, yeah, that's true.
[00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:14.400]   That was my basic point of now what you're saying.
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:17.160]   Everything you guys said sounds smart and technically sound.
[00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:19.600]   But right now my daughter has a OnePlus phone because she's 9.
[00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:23.200]   I don't feel like forking out 9Gs for a phone for 9 years.
[00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:24.560]   So that's the first thing.
[00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:26.240]   So you can get that phone down to 400 bucks.
[00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:28.240]   You can't tell me that this phone is very much--
[00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:29.200]   is any much better than that.
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:30.440]   And they're still turning profit.
[00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:32.440]   And how much profit do you make when you make a million
[00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:34.640]   phones only to sell and you got $30,000
[00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:36.560]   I'm going to warehouse waiting for a screen to bring.
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:37.760]   You're not making any money.
[00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:40.920]   So bring that price point down to maybe $4,500,
[00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:43.000]   make a couple of shekels and get that money.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.440]   And Samsung, yeah, Samsung's got the money for R&D
[00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:47.120]   when they get his doctor of phones from exploding.
[00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:48.560]   Order Washington drives right now.
[00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:50.600]   They don't have time to start their operating system.
[00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:52.640]   They better drive it on this free market and Android.
[00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:55.400]   They can get because they have to pitch a new story on somebody.
[00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:56.880]   Like, hey, I know a phone was booked last year.
[00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:00.040]   But now we got Samsung universe software.
[00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:00.680]   No, bro.
[00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:01.560]   Like they're stuck.
[00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:03.440]   So hit them in the knees, drop that price,
[00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:07.000]   and maybe I'll buy one and give it to my dog or something.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.320]   Samsung, let's just take a quick tour
[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:12.240]   through the week of Samsung.
[00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:14.720]   They say a million safe Galaxy Note 7s
[00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:17.640]   are now in the hands of consumers.
[00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:23.480]   Galaxy Note 7 sales expected to resume in Korea today, yesterday.
[00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:27.000]   The recall hitting 80% of completion.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.640]   But I'm just reading the headlines.
[00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:31.960]   I mean, the Note 7 battery woes continue
[00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:34.440]   as the company investigates phones that are running too hot.
[00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:36.880]   And then what you alluded to, oh, doctors,
[00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:40.680]   there was a big set of stories in the beginning of the week
[00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:44.040]   about Samsung washing machines, the top blowing off
[00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:45.920]   and exploding.
[00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:51.120]   How much does that story undermine their overall QC
[00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:53.520]   and the quality of their products?
[00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:54.800]   It's just hurting brain, right?
[00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:56.720]   Completely different business unit,
[00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:01.320]   completely different unrelated, but to a consumer, right?
[00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:03.000]   Where it's like the political environment.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.520]   It's completely reductionist, right?
[00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:10.160]   The narrative, the story, is just that Samsung stuff explodes.
[00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:11.720]   It was the last thing they needed.
[00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:14.240]   And now, all of a sudden, people, when they go
[00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:16.840]   and they got to buy a washer and they got to decide Samsung
[00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:19.560]   or LG or a fridge or something, right?
[00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:22.600]   They're going to go, it doesn't-- Samsung stuff explode.
[00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:24.520]   And so it hurts.
[00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:28.640]   It's a bad brand thing for them that they're
[00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:30.240]   going to have to deal with.
[00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:32.840]   And it's a shame because they do a lot of cool things
[00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:34.120]   that are done well.
[00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:37.520]   But like you alluded to Becky, it gets it.
[00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:40.520]   The issue of, do they have a quality control problem
[00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:41.520]   throughout the whole company?
[00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:42.600]   Is it a cultural problem?
[00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:44.240]   You sort of have to ask that.
[00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:46.400]   And they kind of like they have a problem
[00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:49.000]   because I had a Samsung washer and a dryer in a fridge.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.720]   And all three of them broke right after the warranty went out.
[00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:54.640]   So I'll never buy a Samsung appliances again.
[00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:57.400]   But that's my personal experience, that you don't hear
[00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:58.160]   that too often.
[00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:00.120]   But now, like you said, when you think about Samsung,
[00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:01.840]   they're like, wait, don't this look that so far?
[00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:03.080]   I don't know if I got fridge.
[00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:05.120]   Did a fridge rob somebody?
[00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:07.320]   Like people start making up things in their mind
[00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:08.000]   about the Samsung.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.040]   Didn't the display have porn on it?
[00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:13.760]   That was a great me, whoever did that as a horrible person.
[00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:15.560]   But that's hysterical.
[00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:18.080]   Well, I mean, other fridges, yeah,
[00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:21.360]   there were issues and recalls going back to the washing machines.
[00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:22.800]   This is not the first time that they've had.
[00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:24.240]   Did you recalls the washing machines?
[00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:27.080]   I had to recall a ton of them, I think, in Australia
[00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:29.360]   because they were doing something.
[00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:31.480]   There was somebody who got it fixed,
[00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:33.000]   and then the repair wasn't fixed correctly,
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.880]   and it ended up catching the house on fire.
[00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:39.840]   And so these things are, of course,
[00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:44.280]   I don't know if they're indicative of a systemic problem or not.
[00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:46.400]   But when all these things are happening in the same year,
[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:49.000]   it is cause for concern, even though, as Jason says,
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.280]   they're in different divisions.
[00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:53.680]   And it looks real bad when you have this disaster
[00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:56.280]   with a Note 7 in which, great, 80% completion rate.
[00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:57.200]   Awesome.
[00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:00.720]   Once we get to 95, once we get to 97, then I'll be impressed.
[00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:02.520]   80% still means in the United States.
[00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:06.640]   So we've got 200,000 phones potentially blowing up.
[00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:12.480]   I was at a conference this week, and so I was in the air twice.
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:15.440]   And on both flights, the flight attendants are saying,
[00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:17.760]   if you have a galaxy, you know, the 7's got to be turned off
[00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:18.480]   completely.
[00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:21.000]   Well, on the second flight, she's actually walking
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.640]   through the cabin and is looking at phones.
[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:24.920]   She comes by and she sees me with my 7+,
[00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:26.800]   and she's like, is that a Samsung?
[00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:29.120]   I'm like, no, this is an iPhone.
[00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:34.280]   But we talked about this when I was on a couple of weeks
[00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:35.560]   ago when the story broke, and I was
[00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:37.520]   on with O'Dokton, and we talked about it.
[00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:39.920]   I was like, oh, how are they going to keep flying out?
[00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:41.760]   Yeah, are they going to police that, or even know?
[00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:43.080]   And they're not, you know.
[00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:44.880]   But just the fact that it's even going
[00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:46.280]   out of the point that flight attendants
[00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:47.920]   are looking at these things.
[00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:50.000]   And I think that anybody's going to be kind of weary
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.480]   of a Samsung is a problem.
[00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:53.200]   And it certainly looks really bad,
[00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:55.000]   even though they're totally different divisions,
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.760]   to have one, two punch, to have all the phone issues,
[00:16:57.760 --> 00:16:59.480]   and then to also have--
[00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:02.400]   we've already seen this before with the washing machines,
[00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:04.840]   but to have that problem, too, is just
[00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:06.800]   like they can't catch a break.
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:09.040]   O'Dokton, thinking about what you said about the price
[00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:10.760]   on that Google phone.
[00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:14.400]   And what's a question I have is that you would think
[00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:16.800]   that they would be able to get the price down,
[00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:19.680]   because fundamentally they're subsidizing their ecosystem
[00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:21.680]   with more and more hardware out there,
[00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:23.360]   and they can control the experience
[00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:26.680]   on the software on the ecosystem, if it's a fact,
[00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:29.440]   if it's a Google Direct phone.
[00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:33.360]   And I'm wondering if that is a reason why they should bring
[00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:36.880]   that down, or if they needed it all,
[00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:38.200]   because if you're in the Android world,
[00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:40.000]   you're in the Android world.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.360]   It's one of those things where the market--
[00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:44.560]   the phone doesn't make you any money.
[00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:46.160]   Carry your subsidized cost of the phone.
[00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:47.320]   Now they've done all this.
[00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:48.960]   Apple does what Apple does, and they're like, look,
[00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:49.560]   we need money.
[00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:50.800]   They're like crackheads.
[00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:52.400]   They figure out ways to get money out of everything.
[00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:54.280]   They said, oh, well, rent your phone from us.
[00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:56.880]   And then everybody stops giving you that super discount
[00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:59.960]   to keep you in a contract, because they're like, well,
[00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:01.000]   we don't worry about contracts.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.600]   We just want you to keep getting this phone.
[00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:03.840]   Now all the carriers are doing it,
[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:05.800]   so now you're basically paying for the full phone
[00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:07.280]   to always get a new phone.
[00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:09.600]   But that old model worked for how many years,
[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:13.120]   or did you were buying this phone for $2.99 or $3.99,
[00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:14.800]   and you would just be with that phone.
[00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:16.240]   If you just got the phone out there,
[00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:17.880]   and that's the money you got for the phone,
[00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:20.560]   and it was great, and people loved it, again,
[00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:23.760]   you could move mountains if you think your device is that good.
[00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:25.480]   If you think that you're pushing stuff forward,
[00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:28.560]   and it's a solid device, get it in as many hands as possible,
[00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:30.320]   because you're not doing a great job marketing,
[00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:31.360]   that's not going to help you.
[00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:33.400]   But again, same thing we said about Samsung,
[00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:35.240]   stuff catching on fire in that lore,
[00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:36.960]   when people say, oh man, I can't really afford a phone.
[00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:38.840]   Oh, I heard that Nexus phone's $2.99.
[00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:39.680]   Oh, what's that?
[00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:41.240]   Oh, there it was, it make Android.
[00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:43.000]   Oh, I'll try that, whatever.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   That would work for you.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.920]   But I'm not marketing for the Nexus.
[00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:49.920]   Yeah, I mean, I think that the challenge would be,
[00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:51.880]   I think they'd have to take a loss,
[00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:53.760]   and whether or not Google will be willing to take a loss
[00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:56.880]   on hardware, I don't know, because they haven't on any
[00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:58.560]   of their other devices ever historically.
[00:18:58.560 --> 00:18:59.520]   They've never taken a loss.
[00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:01.800]   I mean, maybe the Chromecast, maybe,
[00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:05.400]   but I think that probably sells in volume enough that they don't,
[00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:06.760]   but I think they'd have to take a loss,
[00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:08.560]   and they're probably not willing to do that,
[00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:09.560]   considering-- Yeah.
[00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:10.560]   --for our--
[00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:12.280]   --as much as everybody loves the Nexus lines,
[00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:13.800]   as we've discussed, I mean, that's never
[00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:15.080]   sold in large quantities.
[00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:18.320]   And Google, frankly, does not have the Chromecast
[00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:21.640]   not withstanding any track record of selling any product
[00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:24.600]   from their own brand in mass quantities.
[00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:27.200]   Google has literally never sold a harder product other
[00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:29.440]   than the Chromecast in large quantities,
[00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:32.560]   where let's have a big event this week and roll out,
[00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:34.520]   oh, a whole bunch of hardware then.
[00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:35.880]   Yeah.
[00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:36.880]   So, OK.
[00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:38.480]   They need hardware like Apple does software, you know?
[00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:39.320]   Right.
[00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:39.880]   It's rough.
[00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:40.720]   It's smooth.
[00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:44.400]   We've got the air fresheners coming out this week, Google Home,
[00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:47.800]   Wi-Fi speaker with access to music in the cloud,
[00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:51.520]   control it with your voice, Google Cast support, $129.
[00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:53.640]   It's $50 cheaper than Alexa.
[00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:56.560]   Remember, this is all rumored, but we're anticipating.
[00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:58.080]   We're anticipators here.
[00:19:58.080 --> 00:19:59.760]   We're appreciators.
[00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:01.360]   Google Wi-Fi.
[00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:04.160]   Its own branded Wi-Fi router.
[00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:07.320]   Device is going to cost $129.
[00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:12.440]   Competing with Euro, competing with Loomer, mesh networks.
[00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:14.040]   Do you guys have hope for this?
[00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:16.200]   Think it's something that's going to go?
[00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:16.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:18.040]   I can't remember the name of it all of a sudden.
[00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:19.400]   But the one that they released--
[00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:19.880]   sorry.
[00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:21.720]   I have the on--
[00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:23.440]   I can't remember the name of it all of a sudden.
[00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:25.000]   But the one that they released--
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   On Hub.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:26.560]   Thank you.
[00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:28.040]   On Hub.
[00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:31.400]   And because they're right, the routers do kind of stink.
[00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:34.920]   I sort of end up always getting a new one about once a year
[00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:37.880]   because they have the old problem that Windows machines
[00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:39.440]   used to have of BitRot.
[00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:41.880]   You run it for a while, and all of a sudden it's like,
[00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:43.280]   it gets worse and worse.
[00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:48.440]   And so I did try the on Hub, and it's pretty good.
[00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:53.440]   One of the things that I like is it's a little--
[00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:55.840]   it was overpriced a bit, I thought.
[00:20:55.840 --> 00:21:00.000]   But the web interface on it is really good.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.360]   You can look at it on your phone.
[00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:02.480]   You can reset it from your phone
[00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:04.840]   and you can see what devices are connected.
[00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:06.440]   It's a pretty decent router.
[00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:10.040]   So that one, I think, they have some competency in, right?
[00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:16.400]   Like web browsers, internet, like fiber,
[00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:19.240]   the building internet router.
[00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:21.680]   Because this still gets to their core business
[00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:23.000]   and stuff that they're good at.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:27.560]   I think these other devices, I think the Chromecast--
[00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:29.720]   I've got like two or three different Chromecast,
[00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:31.600]   different generation.
[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:33.160]   They're all pretty lousy.
[00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:36.240]   They lose connectivity all the time.
[00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:39.200]   It's just clues you to kind of get them to do things.
[00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:40.440]   I don't think that's a good product.
[00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:42.440]   So certainly, I hope they improve that.
[00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:46.240]   Because it's a great idea, and the price point's fantastic.
[00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:48.200]   Yeah, I mean, that's competitive with Euro, right?
[00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:50.920]   Which is about $500 for three.
[00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:54.040]   Chrissy, you think this has got enough oomph
[00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:56.080]   to actually make it into the mainstream
[00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:58.840]   and get some volume?
[00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:00.080]   Yeah, I mean, I think it could.
[00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:02.400]   I mean, because mesh routers are kind of the new hotness.
[00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:03.840]   You've got Euro and Luma.
[00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:06.880]   And I'm actually testing the Netgear Orbe right now.
[00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:08.320]   And I'm liking that.
[00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:11.160]   And I mean, that's kind of where routers are going.
[00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:13.000]   And these aren't the sorts of things
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:14.640]   that everybody buys, right?
[00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:16.200]   Like they're kind of a niche thing,
[00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:17.960]   because most people are going to use the router that comes
[00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:19.080]   with their modem.
[00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:20.680]   The modem and router is usually one thing.
[00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:23.840]   So you get it from your cable company or whoever.
[00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:24.480]   Don't do that.
[00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:27.240]   By the way, PSA, all you do after business.
[00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:28.560]   Don't do it.
[00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:29.080]   Great.
[00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:29.560]   Go ahead.
[00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:30.080]   Chrissy.
[00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:30.680]   No, you're right.
[00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:34.160]   But I think that having a Google branded router,
[00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:37.480]   even though I personally am too paranoid to ever want Google
[00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:39.000]   to have my router, because I'm like,
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   they already know 95% of the websites I visit.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.240]   But I'd rather keep that 5% just like to myself.
[00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:47.560]   I'd like to have some internet traffic not
[00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:49.200]   tracked by Google someplace in the cloud.
[00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:51.000]   Are you looking at--
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.360]   I mean, you know what I'm looking at.
[00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:52.840]   But--
[00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:53.760]   Which thing is that?
[00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:55.240]   I do know what you're looking at.
[00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:56.960]   You know what I'm looking at.
[00:22:56.960 --> 00:23:00.280]   But no, I'd rather than not know everything.
[00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:02.800]   But I do think that this has potential.
[00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:05.840]   And I think that it would be interesting to see,
[00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:07.600]   especially if they can sell how that'll
[00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:11.880]   work well with Google Home, if all these things
[00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:12.880]   can kind of work together.
[00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:14.200]   Because that's one of the things,
[00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:16.200]   even though Jason's right Apple software
[00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:18.760]   is kind of hit or miss, they've got the whole ecosystem.
[00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:20.000]   You know, you've got the airport extreme.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:20.960]   You've got the Apple TV.
[00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:21.760]   You've got the phones.
[00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:22.880]   You've got the computers.
[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:25.360]   And I think for Google to have an ecosystem,
[00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:27.080]   you've got the Chromecast.
[00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:28.600]   You've got the routers.
[00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:32.400]   You've got the devices and all this other stuff.
[00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:33.560]   That could be interesting.
[00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:37.760]   I love that the chat room is doing the ethical work for me.
[00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:40.040]   Let me know that Eero is a sponsor of the Twit Network.
[00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:41.160]   So we've got to put that out there.
[00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:42.360]   Thank you.
[00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:45.320]   But I would spend $129 on this thing
[00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:50.240]   if it was a combination of Google Home and the Mesh Network.
[00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:51.400]   That makes sense to me.
[00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:52.400]   Yeah.
[00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:54.160]   That's not a good enough price point.
[00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:55.440]   Like I rocked the airport extreme.
[00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:57.280]   I tried one of the Mesh services.
[00:23:57.280 --> 00:23:59.800]   My house is like 2700 square feet.
[00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:04.640]   And it wasn't any better, faster, stronger than my airport
[00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:05.160]   extreme.
[00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:08.800]   So, you know, I guess unless you live in the city,
[00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:10.080]   or there's less pain on your walls,
[00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:12.000]   maybe that Mesh system is going to work a little bit better
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:12.680]   for you.
[00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:15.040]   But I mean, I've had this router for four or five years
[00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:17.560]   since the first came out and it still rocks out.
[00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:21.280]   And also just the people that don't realize having a router
[00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:24.600]   added on with their router provided.
[00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:27.040]   When I use my router to provide for me from Verizon,
[00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:29.960]   my top down low speed is 78.
[00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:32.760]   When I go through the airport extreme, it jumps up to 98.
[00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:34.440]   So I don't know who's capping who.
[00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:38.600]   But this airport extreme is letting the water flow.
[00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:39.120]   Yeah.
[00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:40.400]   Yeah, use the motor.
[00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:41.800]   Fire a motor.
[00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:43.920]   Fire a motor by one router.
[00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:44.440]   Yeah.
[00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:44.880]   Yeah.
[00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:46.720]   I use the airport extreme.
[00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:47.680]   I use it for a long time.
[00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:49.920]   I had it for three or four years.
[00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:51.920]   And I also tried it about the same.
[00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:55.080]   I tried out one of the Mesh network ones as well.
[00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:56.600]   And I had the same thing.
[00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:59.120]   I didn't get that much of a boost out of it.
[00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:04.120]   And that's when I switched to try and this Google one now,
[00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:07.760]   which has been pretty good and has given me a nice boost.
[00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:09.360]   But yeah, I agree.
[00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:11.640]   If we could do nothing else, like encourage everybody out
[00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:14.800]   there, buy your own modem so you're not paying 9, 10 bucks
[00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:18.200]   a month to your cable company and get your own router.
[00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:19.400]   You'll get better speed boost.
[00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:21.120]   You'll get better performance.
[00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:23.200]   And you'll save money in the long run.
[00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:27.160]   It pays itself off usually within a year to two years.
[00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:31.040]   The last big thing we're expecting from Google's event
[00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:32.960]   is Andromeda.
[00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:34.840]   Now, if anyone can really explain this to me,
[00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:36.080]   I will be so thankful.
[00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:39.040]   It sounds like an operating system where
[00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:41.920]   Chrome's peanut butter gets into Android's chocolate.
[00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:43.200]   Have I got that right?
[00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:44.040]   You do.
[00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:45.800]   But yeah, it's basically it.
[00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:47.160]   Say it again.
[00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:48.240]   Say it again.
[00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:49.120]   Say it slow.
[00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:50.080]   It sounds exciting.
[00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:53.480]   Chrome's peanut butter gets into Android's chocolate.
[00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:54.680]   That's what I'm talking about.
[00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:58.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:25:58.280 --> 00:25:59.360]   What's the point of this?
[00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:02.960]   I mean, I know it's to go after MacBook Pro users.
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:03.920]   Is that what we're talking about?
[00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:06.760]   It's got a little bit more functionality than a mobile
[00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:07.520]   operating system.
[00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:08.920]   What are we talking about?
[00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:10.920]   I think it's the other end.
[00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:13.960]   I think it's going after MacBook Air users.
[00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:17.040]   I mean, I think it's going after schools.
[00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:20.920]   It's going after the machine that you give to somebody
[00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:23.800]   who you're always supporting.
[00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:27.840]   Basically, you give them this and now they can get apps.
[00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:29.880]   They can do whatever they need to do.
[00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:31.680]   And they're not going to give themselves some trouble.
[00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:33.320]   They're not going to get viruses.
[00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:35.880]   And boom, you're dead.
[00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:37.000]   Yeah, I think it's that.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.160]   And I think that it's kind of--
[00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:39.960]   I mean, for many years, we've been talking about people
[00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:42.680]   like me have been predicting the merging between Android
[00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:43.680]   and Chrome.
[00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:46.520]   And in Chrome OS and Android-- and I think maybe this is finally
[00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:48.320]   where we're finally seeing those two worlds meet.
[00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:49.640]   Because if you look at what they're
[00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:50.760]   kind of doing on the Chromebooks,
[00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:53.720]   and they're in beta testing, no Chrome app--
[00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:55.280]   Android app support on Chromebooks.
[00:26:55.280 --> 00:27:00.160]   And you're getting better desktop support
[00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:01.640]   for some of the Android devices.
[00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:03.400]   I think that they've kind of figured out
[00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:05.600]   that those two worlds, these two operating systems,
[00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:08.000]   as separate things don't quite exist.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.640]   Because there are certain limitations
[00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:10.760]   when you just have Chrome OS.
[00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:13.920]   It's not quite powerful enough for this being always connected.
[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:15.960]   Operating system doesn't always be for offline stuff.
[00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:18.440]   It doesn't have the apps.
[00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:21.520]   And at the same time, Android doesn't work really well
[00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:24.000]   with the mouse pointer.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.240]   I know it can, but it wasn't really designed--
[00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:28.040]   well, OK, it was originally designed for that.
[00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:30.120]   But it then evolves with touchscreen.
[00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:33.760]   And so I think that just having this fusion of this world,
[00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:34.520]   I think Jason's right.
[00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:36.760]   I think it's really kind of the next step up
[00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:39.360]   from a Chromebook being like, well, this could actually
[00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:41.160]   be your replacement computer.
[00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:43.880]   This could be the thing that you have as your day-to-day machine.
[00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:45.360]   And it could still work with all of your apps
[00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:47.360]   and all of your services that you already know.
[00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:52.800]   But without a feeling as cludgy as Android apps on Chrome OS
[00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:53.280]   feel.
[00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:55.400]   But doesn't this make Google's ecosystem
[00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:56.680]   seem even more fractured?
[00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:58.840]   Or is this replacing something?
[00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:02.520]   And it's going to make it cleaner?
[00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:04.880]   It's like two companies that merge.
[00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:05.920]   It's like two companies that merge.
[00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:07.480]   They start out, and they're like, we're
[00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:09.120]   still going to keep both brands.
[00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:12.320]   And we're going to be great partners and all that.
[00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:13.720]   When you know at the end of the day,
[00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:16.520]   in two years, one of them is toast.
[00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:19.400]   And I feel like that's the case.
[00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:23.280]   I think ultimately, Google wants to replace Android with Chrome.
[00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:27.960]   It controls Chrome, that ecosystem, much more
[00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:30.360]   than it controls the Android ecosystem.
[00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:34.640]   And we're seeing that with this move with the phone.
[00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:36.320]   We're seeing that with the move with them
[00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:38.040]   running their own laptop.
[00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:40.400]   Chrome is the ecosystem.
[00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:41.960]   They make a lot more money on.
[00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:44.680]   You can look that up.
[00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:48.920]   And so this is just a step toward that.
[00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:52.640]   I think it's easy to see.
[00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:55.520]   That doesn't mean Android is going to go away completely.
[00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:57.320]   The Android kernel is going to be out there.
[00:28:57.320 --> 00:28:58.800]   Android devices are going to be out there.
[00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:01.240]   You're going to see, I think, companies like OnePlus,
[00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:03.720]   like Amazon, they're going to build their own things
[00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:05.760]   on Chrome and do all kinds of things.
[00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:08.440]   But I think Google wants to--
[00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:14.000]   once it's the split to alpha, they're much more business-like.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.360]   They're much more profit-focused.
[00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:19.000]   And Chrome makes the money.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.200]   Chrome, they see as the future of their business.
[00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:27.200]   Android, they've had a number of challenges with.
[00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:30.920]   And ultimately, it's just not as financially viable
[00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:31.840]   for them in the long run.
[00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:34.120]   So I think that this is just a step toward that.
[00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:37.840]   And they're fighting in that phone booth that Microsoft is
[00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:40.200]   in right now with their Surface, where they keep telling me
[00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:42.720]   that a Surface does what a MacBook can't.
[00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:44.960]   It keeps telling me what an iPad can't.
[00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:47.200]   They're trying to make it like a laptop, but it's so portable
[00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:48.280]   and you can do everything.
[00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:50.800]   I feel like they want to get into that mobile, a little bit
[00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:52.880]   more power space, but more portability.
[00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:56.240]   So everybody's in the same space, trying to do the same thing.
[00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:58.200]   And they just want their pieces of pie.
[00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:00.240]   Oh, Doc, anything pie in the sky?
[00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:02.560]   One more thing that you would dream up
[00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:05.960]   that Google might surprise us with?
[00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:07.320]   A Google watch.
[00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:08.760]   A Google watch.
[00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:10.240]   Huh?
[00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:11.960]   Anything you guys think of that might be possible?
[00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:12.800]   Google knows everything.
[00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:15.200]   Like, I could just talk to my watch and it could just do it.
[00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:17.600]   And my friends make a faces at me,
[00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:19.440]   and I'm sorry, I got distracted.
[00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:21.280]   But yes, a Google watch.
[00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:22.200]   Google watch.
[00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:22.800]   OK.
[00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:23.240]   All right.
[00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:25.640]   Well, you heard it here first.
[00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:28.280]   We are going to take a quick break.
[00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:31.120]   Leo Laport, the host of this show you may have heard of him.
[00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:32.880]   He is on a boat somewhere.
[00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:35.960]   Denmark-ish, a little more made land.
[00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:38.000]   I'm Becky Worley at Be Worley on Twitter.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.520]   But for the moment, we're going to hear Leo.
[00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:43.120]   We'll have more with the great panel on this week in tech.
[00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:45.960]   Thank you for filling in for me while I'm gone.
[00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:48.640]   But I wanted to stop back and remind you
[00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:51.320]   about one of our great supporters and sponsors
[00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:53.280]   on this network, BrainTree.
[00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:55.760]   If you're a mobile app developer,
[00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:59.880]   and you want to include payments in your mobile app
[00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:02.920]   or your website, you've got to know about BrainTree.
[00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:05.200]   If you've done any research, I'm sure you've seen the name
[00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:07.480]   BrainTree comes to you from PayPal.
[00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:09.840]   So it's got a great lineage.
[00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:11.920]   It's also used by everybody.
[00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:13.600]   And I think that should give you a piece of mine.
[00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:18.120]   When Uber and Lyft both use BrainTree in their payments,
[00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:20.440]   in their apps, that tells you something.
[00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:23.640]   Airbnb and hotels tonight.
[00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:24.720]   GitHub, right?
[00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:26.920]   I mean, these guys have the--
[00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:28.640]   the world is their oyster.
[00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:32.520]   They chose BrainTree as their payment stack.
[00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:36.640]   BrainTree's full stack payment platform not only supports
[00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:37.840]   every kind of payment now.
[00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:40.980]   Android Pay and Apple Pay and-- well, even Bitcoin credit
[00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:43.200]   cards, of course, Venmo.
[00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:45.280]   I mean, it's a really good solution in that regard.
[00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:47.440]   When something new comes along, the next big thing,
[00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:48.720]   you don't have to worry about it.
[00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:50.400]   You just go to your BrainTree control panel,
[00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:53.080]   check the box, and you're in.
[00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:54.440]   You're done.
[00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:58.080]   You'll be able to accept any kind of currency from pounds
[00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:02.360]   to PayPal, to that new payment system from any device.
[00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:04.320]   And it's just a few lines of code.
[00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:05.840]   It could not be easier.
[00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:07.480]   It's got everything you need.
[00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:10.360]   No late nights, no complicated recoding.
[00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:13.920]   And frankly, the security issues that alone with a shopping
[00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:15.200]   card, you should not do it.
[00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:17.360]   You should let the pros do it.
[00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:19.480]   And you don't have to worry about staying ahead of the curve.
[00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:22.840]   You've got plenty of other things to do with your app.
[00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:24.800]   Let BrainTree handle the payments.
[00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:27.960]   Simple, secure, code you can integrate quickly.
[00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:32.920]   Android, iOS, JavaScript, as .NET, node.js, Java,
[00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:34.600]   Pearl, PHP, Python, Ruby.
[00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:38.040]   It's clear code, clear documentation.
[00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:40.760]   And it lets you do what you do best
[00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:42.200]   while they do what they do best.
[00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:43.360]   And you know who's happiest?
[00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:44.960]   Your users.
[00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:46.320]   They love it.
[00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:49.080]   You love it when you use an Uber or a Lyft, right?
[00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:53.320]   BrainTreePayments.com/twit.
[00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:55.440]   Give them a try today.
[00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:59.800]   Now we go back to the news of the week with this week in tech.
[00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:02.760]   Leo Laport, thank you ever so much.
[00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:04.040]   Leo's on vacation.
[00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:05.520]   He's just making virtual appearances.
[00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:09.840]   But I am joined thankfully by Owen JJ Stone, Odocta on Twitter.
[00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:11.120]   He is an amazing man.
[00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:13.880]   He is multitasking like you've never seen.
[00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:15.920]   Right now, he's speaking with his daughter, I think,
[00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:17.760]   letting her know what she needs to be doing.
[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:20.480]   Yes, Odocta, I'm talking to you.
[00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:23.960]   Jason Heiner, tech republic, CBS Interactive.
[00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:25.920]   Thank you for joining us.
[00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:28.040]   And glad to have you.
[00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:31.040]   And Christina Warren from Gizmodo, senior writer there.
[00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:34.640]   And in the know about all things tech.
[00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:39.240]   Notable this week, Elon Musk.
[00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:43.440]   He has a plan for our future, colonizing Mars.
[00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:46.760]   At the International Astronautical--
[00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:48.920]   yes, at the International Astronautical Conference
[00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:50.800]   in Guadalajara, Mexico.
[00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:51.360]   He gave a talk.
[00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:55.360]   It was called Making Humans a Multi-planetary Species.
[00:33:55.360 --> 00:34:00.400]   And this is his idea for getting to Mars.
[00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:01.760]   SpaceX.
[00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:03.360]   I'm going to break down the specifics.
[00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:04.880]   Because that's basically what Elon did.
[00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:06.800]   It was incredible.
[00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:10.360]   Whenever he does this, when he gets into the nitty gritty
[00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:14.280]   of talking about his absolutely insane plans,
[00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:18.200]   it sort of boggles my mind at how bored he sounds, talking
[00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:21.360]   about these amazing ideas and seemingly
[00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:24.480]   impossible to execute concepts.
[00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:28.680]   So I will try not to go at it with the same sense of like,
[00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:30.600]   oh, yes, when we go to Mars, board them.
[00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:32.680]   But let me just try and break this down for you.
[00:34:32.680 --> 00:34:37.960]   So SpaceX would use reusable BFRs.
[00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:43.680]   These are big, bleep, rockets, along with the BFS.
[00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:46.360]   Big, bleep, spaceship.
[00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:50.800]   Raptor rockets capable of 680,000 pounds of thrust.
[00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:55.120]   The ship would carry 100 tons of cargo.
[00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:58.560]   Once in orbit, it would be refueled.
[00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:01.400]   Then it takes off for Mars.
[00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:03.840]   He really got down to the nitty gritty in terms of cost.
[00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:06.560]   So right now, he says it would cost about $10 billion
[00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:08.840]   per person to send someone to Mars.
[00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:10.640]   His goal is to scale this down.
[00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:12.800]   Just make it-- the economies of scale work for him,
[00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:19.120]   targeting $200,000 per person, eventually $100,000.
[00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:21.400]   He's all about reusable parts.
[00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:24.800]   Trips take 100 people at a time.
[00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:27.760]   The spaceship would have movie rooms, cafeterias,
[00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:28.920]   entertainment options.
[00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:31.880]   He says it would be a really fun place.
[00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:34.440]   That's his quote, a fun place.
[00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:36.360]   Yeah, I don't know how long you'd have to be on that ship.
[00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:39.280]   That's sort of terrifying.
[00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:44.240]   He's targeting 2022 for these flights.
[00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:46.160]   Public and private organizations are
[00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:47.560]   going to help fund the missions.
[00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:53.360]   And a million humans could live on Mars by the 2060s.
[00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:54.040]   Are you guys in?
[00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:54.920]   You going?
[00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:57.200]   Can I break in on this report real quick, just for two seconds?
[00:35:57.200 --> 00:35:57.960]   Whoa.
[00:35:57.960 --> 00:35:59.120]   You've been hijacked.
[00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:00.280]   This is my buddy Tony.
[00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:01.160]   Say hi to people, Tony.
[00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:02.120]   Hi, how's it going?
[00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:03.560]   Tony, what's your college degree?
[00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:05.840]   I have a bachelor's degree in marine science
[00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:07.400]   with a concentration in marine biology.
[00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:09.200]   What's your current job right now?
[00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:10.080]   Jet mechanic.
[00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:11.080]   For who?
[00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:12.200]   The United States Air Force.
[00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:13.720]   So basically Tony's really smart guy
[00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:16.120]   just trying to do as quick as possible, so reference.
[00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:18.840]   Tony, are we going to Mars?
[00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:20.280]   How long will take us to Mars?
[00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:23.400]   Tony's face expresses skepticism for those of you listening.
[00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:23.800]   How long?
[00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:24.320]   How long, Tony?
[00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:25.960]   Just give me an estimated time period, like a year.
[00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:26.960]   I'm not--
[00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:27.480]   A long time.
[00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:28.680]   50,000, 20,000?
[00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:30.640]   No, like a long time.
[00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:31.600]   Like a hundred thousand--
[00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:32.480]   More than 10 years.
[00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:33.120]   More than 10?
[00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:33.600]   Yeah.
[00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:34.600]   OK.
[00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:35.600]   That's all I need.
[00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:36.200]   Good.
[00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:38.400]   So the big brain sitting next to you,
[00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:42.040]   Odakta, says this is total malarkey.
[00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:44.120]   We're not going to Mars.
[00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:44.880]   We're not going to Mars.
[00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:47.280]   First of all, I'll let you guys talk, but let me just say this.
[00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:48.800]   I love Elon Musk.
[00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:49.680]   I love the Sun.
[00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:50.560]   I love the solar.
[00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:51.680]   I love Hyperloop.
[00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:53.480]   I love most of the things he talks about.
[00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:56.440]   But for Pete's sake, could you just use that big brain?
[00:36:56.440 --> 00:36:59.640]   And all this money you want to put into a desert rock planet
[00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:00.960]   that doesn't sustain life?
[00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:02.720]   And fix the planet we got right now.
[00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:04.960]   Can we figure out a way to stop killing all these bees
[00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:05.800]   in the ocean?
[00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:07.840]   So we got out of planet we got right here
[00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:08.920]   for sustainability.
[00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:11.560]   Can we get $10 billion to just clean up the homeless
[00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:13.000]   and give them a job or something?
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.280]   Instead of per person, to put them on a planet that
[00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:17.480]   can't sustain life, can we do that, Elon?
[00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:18.520]   I love you so much.
[00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:21.080]   I hate the way you manipulate the stock market in my heart.
[00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:22.640]   But shut up about Mars.
[00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:24.680]   And you little ship that crashes half the time,
[00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:27.080]   then they're going to be with a land on a-- just stop it.
[00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:28.560]   We ain't going to Mars.
[00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:29.840]   We ain't going to Mars.
[00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:31.360]   We ain't going to Mars.
[00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:34.800]   Now go ahead and talk about it.
[00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:36.120]   That's it for Twitter.
[00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:37.560]   Thanks for joining us.
[00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:39.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:41.440]   I just--
[00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:43.160]   I loved and I loved him so much.
[00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:46.800]   Like, just give me the sun, Elon.
[00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:48.280]   Fix this Earth we got.
[00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:51.200]   Because you-- and bro people can't get to Mars.
[00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:52.520]   So you want to send these rich--
[00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:54.840]   OK, Jason Calicana is going to be the first person Mars.
[00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:55.680]   He ain't no engineer.
[00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:56.480]   He ain't no mechanic.
[00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:57.120]   He can't fix.
[00:37:57.120 --> 00:37:58.040]   What's he going to do?
[00:37:58.040 --> 00:37:59.320]   Complain about the weather?
[00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:03.080]   Like, we need-- we need gunkers to get to--
[00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:05.440]   it's not what happened, bro.
[00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:07.600]   That's the perfect segue to the--
[00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:08.840]   something I learned last week.
[00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:13.360]   So the same day that Elon announced this,
[00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:16.480]   when I was at this event, Idea Festival last week,
[00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:19.080]   which is an innovation event, but it's like 10--
[00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:22.880]   10 costs to you like $10,000, $10,000, right?
[00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:26.320]   This event cost you like $100, $200.
[00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:28.560]   But it's the same kind of people, right?
[00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:29.840]   Talking about big ideas.
[00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:33.160]   So the day that Elon was talking to his big ideas about Mars,
[00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:37.760]   there was somebody there, one of the candidates for Mars 1.
[00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:42.200]   So there's this nonprofit organization called Mars 1.
[00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:46.520]   They do a lot of work with--
[00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:49.240]   it's an international-based organization.
[00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:50.640]   They do a lot of work with NASA.
[00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:53.680]   But there's a Mars 1 candidate.
[00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:56.400]   They've got this down to 100 candidates.
[00:38:56.400 --> 00:39:00.800]   It's this MIT systems analyst named Yari Golden Castiano.
[00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:02.760]   And so she was at Idea Festival talking
[00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:04.520]   about the fact that-- I had no idea about this.
[00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:05.960]   I hadn't heard of this.
[00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:07.960]   But it was ironically early.
[00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:09.000]   It was that morning.
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:12.760]   And then Elon made his presentation that afternoon.
[00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:17.000]   So I knew a lot more about Mars by the time he did it.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.640]   So Mars 1 is this group that they're basically
[00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:22.400]   sending scientists, people who can go and study it.
[00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:26.560]   Because what they found is that we've sent these all of the--
[00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:28.080]   it's not space tourism.
[00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:32.240]   It's-- they're trying to get some scientists to go up there
[00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:33.400]   and do the same thing.
[00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:35.640]   And ultimately, Elon's worried about which
[00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:39.920]   is if we trash this planet, what are we going to do?
[00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:45.040]   And so we've sort of reached the limits, what Mars 1 posits,
[00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:48.200]   is that we've reached the limits of what we can do with robots.
[00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:49.920]   We actually have to send some people there.
[00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:52.320]   But sending them and they get them back is the hard thing.
[00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:57.880]   So they want to take a group of 24 people, interdisciplinary,
[00:39:57.880 --> 00:40:01.480]   send them to Mars, create this colony
[00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:04.240]   with these 24 people, these scientists.
[00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:06.800]   And so because of that, they're working on--
[00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:09.440]   so one of the things that Yari is working on that she talked
[00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:12.680]   about-- we have a video of this on Tech Republic.
[00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:14.920]   We got an interview with her afterward.
[00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:18.160]   She's working on this laser-based communication.
[00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:19.840]   So that-- because right now, it takes anywhere
[00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:23.080]   from several minutes to almost an hour
[00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:27.080]   to get a communication from Mars to Earth.
[00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:30.840]   And so this laser-based satellite communication
[00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:34.840]   basically super high speed networking will send it a lot faster.
[00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:39.880]   But the idea is the stuff-- and she's working on this at MIT--
[00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:43.160]   and with the idea of hoping that she's
[00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:45.720]   going to be one of the candidates on this, but if not,
[00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:48.640]   at least she can develop technology that's going to help.
[00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:51.960]   And oh, by the way, this technology to get at your point,
[00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:55.680]   ODOT, is that this technology can actually
[00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:57.560]   help us here on Earth, too.
[00:40:57.560 --> 00:40:59.840]   And so like a lot of the space technology, right?
[00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:04.240]   A lot of the stuff that went into the space program ended up--
[00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:06.440]   yeah, it was OK, and it did interesting things
[00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:07.600]   for the space program.
[00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:11.560]   But the record of the kind of advances
[00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:16.280]   that they gave to the tech industry is huge.
[00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:20.040]   And so that's the bigger benefit to a lot of this stuff.
[00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:24.120]   I think for Elon's case, he's sort of the showman.
[00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:26.720]   And so his is sort of the PT Barnum version of the Mars
[00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:27.220]   story.
[00:41:27.220 --> 00:41:29.760]   But there are other people who are working on this as well.
[00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:32.040]   And it's important not to forget that.
[00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:36.520]   Their goal is they want to send someone two Mars by 2027.
[00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:37.800]   And they are working toward that.
[00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:40.920]   They just narrow down their 100 candidates.
[00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:46.680]   Next year, in 2017, they're going to name the 24 candidates.
[00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:50.400]   And then they're working on working toward this
[00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:51.960]   for over the next decade.
[00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:53.960]   Christine, are you buying it?
[00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:55.760]   No, I mean, I think eventually.
[00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:58.760]   Yeah, I think eventually I think that because there
[00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:00.800]   is real science happening and there's
[00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:03.040]   real potential for space for exploration,
[00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:04.280]   I think, will we get there sure?
[00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:06.720]   I think not to discount Elon because I
[00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:09.960]   think that what he's doing is important just insofar
[00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:12.080]   that it gets people paying attention.
[00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:13.000]   It's exciting.
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:15.800]   But to Jason's point, he's very much a PT Barnum sort of guy.
[00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:19.280]   And I mean, I think making these populations like 2022,
[00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:20.400]   that's so close.
[00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:22.200]   Come on now.
[00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:23.480]   Let's be real.
[00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:26.480]   I also really appreciate, I guess,
[00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:27.840]   it's sort of funny to me, the way
[00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:28.680]   he kind of phrases this.
[00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:30.200]   He's like, well, you could die on this mission.
[00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:33.000]   So please pay me $500,000 to go on this mission
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:34.800]   where you might die.
[00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:37.600]   And oh, I'm not willing to go yet until I know that someone
[00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:39.320]   can take over my company.
[00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:41.760]   Because this is basically kind of a suicide mission.
[00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:43.240]   And so part of me is kind of--
[00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:47.200]   I'm intrigued by, I think, what space exploration could do.
[00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:50.040]   But a little bit, I guess, bothered by--
[00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:52.320]   even though I know that fundamentally, what
[00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:54.680]   some of the things that Elon Musk wants to do
[00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:59.920]   have broader technology and scientific, I guess,
[00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:02.200]   pursuits at their core.
[00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:06.000]   So much of it does seem to just be about space tourism, which,
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.200]   to me, it's kind of bothersome.
[00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:11.040]   Because the last thing that-- at least that I want,
[00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:12.680]   in the way it's already kind of seeming
[00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:15.040]   like how it's being sold now is this is kind of being sold
[00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:17.560]   like the modern era of climbing Mount Everest,
[00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:20.360]   whereas just rich people who pay $100,000
[00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:22.480]   and go and climb the mountain because they can.
[00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:24.520]   And this is going to be a thing where people who
[00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:28.640]   are rich enough to go to Mars will go versus people who
[00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:32.480]   are actually looking at discovering other systems
[00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:34.400]   and what's habitable and what's not,
[00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:38.880]   and discovering technologies that might have pursuits
[00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:39.680]   other places.
[00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:40.760]   I don't know.
[00:43:40.760 --> 00:43:43.120]   The whole thing is kind of like--
[00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:46.120]   his whole description of Mars, all I can think about
[00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:48.360]   is the movie "Wally" and be like, yeah, you OK.
[00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:51.720]   So we're just all going to be on this other planet
[00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:58.040]   sitting in Stasis, not moving around, just eating and watching
[00:43:58.040 --> 00:43:58.640]   TV.
[00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:00.320]   That's going to be a life.
[00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:03.560]   The best place on Mars is--
[00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:07.560]   the best place on Mars is worse than the worst place on Earth.
[00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:11.680]   And yeah, Elon, not only is the trip
[00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:15.280]   there on this massive ship going to be fun,
[00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:16.960]   because they'll be movie theaters--
[00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:17.480]   Sure.
[00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:18.080]   --of course at Elon.
[00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:20.680]   Because they have movie theaters on my plane to New York
[00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:21.960]   that I take every couple weeks.
[00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:23.480]   That's not so much fun.
[00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:25.840]   But anyways, he also said it would be a lot of fun on Mars,
[00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:29.320]   because the gravity's low.
[00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:30.600]   But one thing that struck me--
[00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:32.840]   I kind of feel like a dummy that I didn't--
[00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:34.640]   I'm sure everyone else has thought of this before,
[00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:36.240]   but it really struck me in his talk,
[00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:40.200]   how when we think about all of the space exploration
[00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:42.160]   and all of the technology innovations that
[00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:45.040]   came out of that when we did this through NASA and the moon
[00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:48.960]   shot, and how those spawned so many businesses
[00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:51.120]   and so much entrepreneurship and innovation
[00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:55.040]   as those engineers spun out of the government programs
[00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:56.480]   and started their own companies.
[00:44:56.480 --> 00:45:00.080]   But that now it's privatized from the start here with Elon.
[00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:01.040]   Right.
[00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:03.760]   And so you've got-- he was talking about on the ship
[00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:06.160]   once it's launched and it's en route to Mars
[00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:07.720]   that the solar arrays will deploy.
[00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:11.080]   And I thought, of course, solar, Elon, Solar City.
[00:45:11.080 --> 00:45:13.400]   Then, of course, that'll be putting itself--
[00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:15.640]   you know, it'll be storing energy into batteries, which
[00:45:15.640 --> 00:45:18.160]   will be a part of everything he's doing with Tesla.
[00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:22.760]   Then there's just all the engines
[00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:25.200]   that he's going to be innovating, that he's doing,
[00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:26.360]   obviously, now with SpaceX.
[00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:29.600]   But there's got to be a crossover with Hyperloop
[00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:32.800]   or with Tesla and realizing that all of this innovation
[00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:38.120]   and privatization of innovation is going to be in one--
[00:45:38.120 --> 00:45:42.320]   it's a publicly traded company, but in one company's auspices.
[00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:44.320]   And they will own all of that.
[00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:46.520]   And that kind of was just dawned on me, wow,
[00:45:46.520 --> 00:45:48.040]   all these pieces fit together.
[00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:50.200]   His brain is really big.
[00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:51.080]   Oh, it's--
[00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:52.600]   Go ahead.
[00:45:52.600 --> 00:45:54.760]   I was just going to say, no, you're right.
[00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:56.200]   I was going to say his brain is huge.
[00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:57.960]   But that is sort of problematic, though, isn't it?
[00:45:57.960 --> 00:45:59.080]   Because I mean, you're pointing on,
[00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:00.520]   like, he's obviously seeing all these puzzles
[00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:01.880]   and how it works for him.
[00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:03.200]   But I mean, but something like, I think,
[00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:05.360]   that travel to another planet should be about bigger
[00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:08.400]   than just one public company, one private enterprise.
[00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:10.600]   He is nice enough to say, yo, I know you guys
[00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:12.080]   are trying to make cars or electric.
[00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:13.800]   You know, when I do it, here's the patent.
[00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:14.640]   I'm just letting it go.
[00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:16.440]   I'm not going to fight you guys at court anymore.
[00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:17.960]   He seems like a decent of guy when
[00:46:17.960 --> 00:46:20.560]   he's not being an insane sociopath.
[00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:24.120]   I'm just saying, you told me that we could run the whole world
[00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:25.360]   on solar, and we know that.
[00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:26.080]   But guess what?
[00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:29.080]   Human beings can't get together to go take some land out
[00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:31.080]   in North Dakota, build a solar farm,
[00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:32.600]   and give everybody free electricity.
[00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:33.480]   We can't do that.
[00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:33.960]   And guess what?
[00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:35.320]   Hyperloop, I haven't seen it.
[00:46:35.320 --> 00:46:37.360]   We got a test track that's probably scrambling eggs
[00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:39.520]   and small chickens, brains, somewhere out in the desert.
[00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:41.560]   So I'm telling you, give me free power--
[00:46:41.560 --> 00:46:43.720]   Well, Hyperloop, the company's in chaos.
[00:46:43.720 --> 00:46:47.040]   The Hyperloop stuff, that the drama there is fantastic.
[00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:49.240]   Because again, we're just going to Mars
[00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:51.240]   and eating cookies and dough on the ice cream
[00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:52.280]   and watching the ship.
[00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:54.240]   You can't get Hyperloop together.
[00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:56.160]   We ain't even got our solar farms yet.
[00:46:56.160 --> 00:46:58.200]   Would you just pump the brakes?
[00:46:58.200 --> 00:46:59.400]   Are we living in domes?
[00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:00.640]   We're not going to Mars.
[00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:01.720]   We're not going to Mars.
[00:47:01.720 --> 00:47:02.560]   We're not going to Mars.
[00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:04.400]   We're making the Model 3 in mass production first.
[00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:05.240]   Right.
[00:47:05.240 --> 00:47:06.240]   Right.
[00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:09.040]   I'm just saying, he just sounds like a little kid
[00:47:09.040 --> 00:47:12.320]   that's got Plato and telling me how he's going to make a store.
[00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:13.840]   And he's going to have millions of dollars
[00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:15.520]   cutting on my-- but, Doug, it's Plato.
[00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:16.360]   Trust me.
[00:47:16.360 --> 00:47:19.040]   I'm going to make this store out of--
[00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:20.320]   and we're going to be rich, dad.
[00:47:20.320 --> 00:47:23.720]   I'm just like, OK, kid, go on your room and imagine it.
[00:47:23.720 --> 00:47:26.360]   I always thought of space as--
[00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:28.360]   I think I'm space phobic because it
[00:47:28.360 --> 00:47:31.640]   makes me feel like there's dystopian future that's
[00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:35.840]   in great around the corner that's going to come crashing down
[00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:36.560]   on my children.
[00:47:36.560 --> 00:47:41.320]   So dystopian, space phobic didn't want to even pay attention.
[00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:44.880]   Somehow, Elon talking about it and making it sound so boring
[00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:46.200]   and so doable.
[00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:49.440]   Even in his delusional mind, I will totally give you that,
[00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:50.920]   oh, doctor.
[00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:52.800]   But logical, delusional.
[00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:55.520]   Maybe that's too contradictory to be real.
[00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:56.840]   But Jason, what do you think?
[00:47:56.840 --> 00:48:00.440]   Is there a logical insanity here?
[00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:01.160]   Yeah.
[00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:06.080]   I mean, I think the thing about Elon is,
[00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:08.920]   in the truest sense of the word and it gets overused,
[00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:10.680]   he's a true visionary.
[00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:15.080]   The guy dreams in-- he sits around daydreaming
[00:48:15.080 --> 00:48:16.680]   and wishes he didn't have to eat.
[00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:18.400]   He's talked about the fact that how much
[00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:20.640]   he liked the idea of something like "soiling"
[00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:22.840]   because then he could take all--
[00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:25.920]   this like, whatever, 43 minutes a day
[00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:28.920]   that it takes to eat meals and get rid of that
[00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:30.400]   and put it in a more productive time,
[00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:31.800]   like dreaming about Mars, right?
[00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:34.440]   And solar power and all these kinds of things.
[00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:39.640]   And so I think that Elon sets these super aggressive goals.
[00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:42.680]   His companies never get there.
[00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:45.680]   But on the way to trying to get there,
[00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:50.760]   they get to things faster than other companies, right?
[00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:53.360]   Tesla's way far ahead in battery technology,
[00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:56.600]   or way far ahead in electric vehicles.
[00:48:56.600 --> 00:49:00.320]   They're way far ahead in a lot of these things
[00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:05.480]   because he sets these crazy, stupid, aggressive goals
[00:49:05.480 --> 00:49:09.360]   that we're going to accomplish this massively hard thing
[00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:10.320]   by this time.
[00:49:10.320 --> 00:49:12.040]   And that's what leaders do, right?
[00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:16.320]   Leaders push, leaders reach, leaders get you
[00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:19.480]   to get more out of you than you thought was possible.
[00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:22.640]   And so I agree with everybody on the panel.
[00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:26.840]   Like 2022-- or yeah, it's not happening.
[00:49:26.840 --> 00:49:29.320]   Like it is not happening.
[00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:32.480]   2027, this other Mars, one group, maybe.
[00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:34.680]   Maybe Elon falls somewhere in there.
[00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:37.360]   Like I said, it sounds very PT Barnum to me.
[00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:40.240]   It sounds maybe 20 years off.
[00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:42.320]   But I think that--
[00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:44.120]   I can't remember somebody said the fact
[00:49:44.120 --> 00:49:47.040]   about how passionate he was talking about this,
[00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:49.840]   even compared to some of the other things you Becky,
[00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:51.800]   even compared to some of the other stuff he does
[00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:54.360]   where he is reasonably passionate.
[00:49:54.360 --> 00:49:57.320]   I think this is the thing that gets him up in the morning.
[00:49:57.320 --> 00:49:59.640]   I think this whole Mars thing.
[00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:01.880]   And I'll give you, Owen, the fact
[00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:03.880]   that there's some bigger problems I
[00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:06.120]   wish he would spend his time focusing on
[00:50:06.120 --> 00:50:09.560]   because the guy does that serious brainpower.
[00:50:09.560 --> 00:50:11.920]   If you want to dream big, look me in my face and tell me,
[00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:12.760]   you know what?
[00:50:12.760 --> 00:50:14.200]   We have problems with the coral reefs.
[00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:15.680]   If you don't know anything about the coral reefs,
[00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:17.560]   it affects the fishing community.
[00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:20.200]   The fish community impacts the people on land.
[00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:23.160]   And the food industry, because chickens and all that,
[00:50:23.160 --> 00:50:23.880]   they eat fish meal.
[00:50:23.880 --> 00:50:25.440]   But you don't understand how much fish is in it.
[00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:27.400]   And we get, hey, you don't-- Elon Musk, come out and tell me
[00:50:27.400 --> 00:50:29.040]   you're going to solve that problem in 10 years.
[00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:30.920]   And I'm strip butt naked and run through these streets
[00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:32.120]   and not nobody wants to see it.
[00:50:32.120 --> 00:50:33.480]   But I'd be so happy and proud.
[00:50:33.480 --> 00:50:35.840]   It's like you told me that we could take a small patch of land
[00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:36.720]   and power the world.
[00:50:36.720 --> 00:50:38.320]   Like, I understand about vision.
[00:50:38.320 --> 00:50:39.320]   I got a lot of vision.
[00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:41.840]   I got a vision of a machine like a sit-in and just lose weight
[00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:42.680]   and not do anything.
[00:50:42.680 --> 00:50:44.080]   It just melts off the fact.
[00:50:44.080 --> 00:50:44.760]   I can envision it.
[00:50:44.760 --> 00:50:45.720]   It ain't going to happen.
[00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:47.200]   It sounds like it's a cool thing.
[00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:48.240]   About 20, 27.
[00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:49.320]   I can be 150 pounds.
[00:50:49.320 --> 00:50:50.280]   It's just Santa.
[00:50:50.280 --> 00:50:51.760]   He just thinks the fun stuff.
[00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:52.640]   Doesn't make it a video.
[00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:53.960]   He sounds like a little kid sometimes.
[00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:55.360]   He gets all hyped up on his stuff.
[00:50:55.360 --> 00:50:57.640]   And he moves mountains with his words.
[00:50:57.640 --> 00:50:59.800]   If he told you he liked cookie dough,
[00:50:59.800 --> 00:51:02.280]   the stock market would triple within the next half hour
[00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:03.000]   after a tweet.
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:04.400]   The man's got too much power.
[00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:07.200]   He fixed the planet first before you start going to a red desert
[00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:08.000]   with nothing on it.
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:09.240]   I'm not going to yell about it anymore.
[00:51:09.240 --> 00:51:10.680]   It just makes me really upset.
[00:51:10.680 --> 00:51:12.120]   He never talks about it.
[00:51:12.120 --> 00:51:13.760]   He gets connected though.
[00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:14.680]   Sorry to admit it.
[00:51:14.680 --> 00:51:15.960]   It's all interconnected.
[00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:18.160]   And what's interesting about that,
[00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:21.600]   O'Dokta, is that he never talks about political will
[00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:25.320]   or the moral will to do some of these things.
[00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:29.360]   He's only dealing with what he has under his control.
[00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:33.240]   And what's incredible is how much control he actually has.
[00:51:33.240 --> 00:51:34.080]   He's growing.
[00:51:34.080 --> 00:51:35.920]   It's only going to keep growing too, yeah.
[00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:37.560]   He's growing his kingdom with an iron fist.
[00:51:37.560 --> 00:51:39.160]   That's for sure.
[00:51:39.160 --> 00:51:41.960]   Well, we are living in the kingdom of Leo Laporte.
[00:51:41.960 --> 00:51:45.960]   And so long as I'm just sitting on the throne here temporarily,
[00:51:45.960 --> 00:51:47.760]   I must take a break.
[00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:51.000]   I'm going to let you guys go drink some soilent.
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:54.160]   And Leo's going to tell us one who--
[00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:55.800]   The crown fits you well.
[00:51:55.800 --> 00:51:56.760]   The crown fits you well.
[00:51:56.760 --> 00:51:57.520]   Our show today brought to you.
[00:51:57.520 --> 00:51:58.320]   Thank you, folks.
[00:51:58.320 --> 00:52:00.280]   And we'll be right back to the panel in just a moment.
[00:52:00.280 --> 00:52:02.280]   But I wanted to tell you about Squarespace.
[00:52:02.280 --> 00:52:04.520]   Because I'm a happy Squarespace customer.
[00:52:04.520 --> 00:52:06.800]   I haven't been for years.
[00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:09.080]   They've been a sponsor of our shows for years.
[00:52:09.080 --> 00:52:10.760]   In fact, we've grown with them, which
[00:52:10.760 --> 00:52:11.680]   is really nice.
[00:52:11.680 --> 00:52:14.520]   Squarespace is the place to make your next website,
[00:52:14.520 --> 00:52:18.240]   whether it's a blog, a portfolio, an online store.
[00:52:18.240 --> 00:52:21.280]   They are the best templates with the best design
[00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:23.200]   and the best engineering.
[00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:24.920]   So your site not only looks beautiful,
[00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:28.440]   but works beautifully in a modern way.
[00:52:28.440 --> 00:52:30.560]   Things like mobile responsive design.
[00:52:30.560 --> 00:52:32.440]   Used to be you'd have a separate mobile site
[00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:33.480]   and a desktop site.
[00:52:33.480 --> 00:52:34.440]   That's nuts.
[00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:36.600]   Because now you don't know what size screen people
[00:52:36.600 --> 00:52:38.200]   are going to visit your site on.
[00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:41.000]   But Squarespace handles it from a 50-inch big screen
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:45.000]   monitor all the way down to a four-inch iPhone 4.
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:48.400]   Your site's going to look great.
[00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:55.240]   And by the way, built-in commerce on every Squarespace site
[00:52:55.240 --> 00:52:57.680]   optimized for mobile.
[00:52:57.680 --> 00:52:59.920]   So it's easy for the mobile shopper.
[00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:01.680]   You could sell unlimited products.
[00:53:01.680 --> 00:53:03.440]   They don't charge you transaction fees.
[00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:07.320]   They support you with all the tools you need.
[00:53:07.320 --> 00:53:09.480]   And of course, all your data and financial information
[00:53:09.480 --> 00:53:11.080]   is safe.
[00:53:11.080 --> 00:53:12.720]   Your customers will appreciate that.
[00:53:12.720 --> 00:53:13.800]   They're also looking-- and I think
[00:53:13.800 --> 00:53:16.160]   this is really one of the few platforms that it does
[00:53:16.160 --> 00:53:18.320]   at a shopping cart that matches your site,
[00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:20.120]   because it's all the same template.
[00:53:20.120 --> 00:53:22.120]   So it's not like, oh, here's a shopping cart
[00:53:22.120 --> 00:53:23.920]   hung off the side of your site.
[00:53:23.920 --> 00:53:25.680]   It is your site.
[00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:27.000]   With a Squarespace dashboard, you
[00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:29.120]   can manage your business's workflow.
[00:53:29.120 --> 00:53:32.480]   You can offer fast customer service that's built in.
[00:53:32.480 --> 00:53:35.200]   You could process orders, send shipment notifications,
[00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:36.920]   handle refunds in seconds.
[00:53:36.920 --> 00:53:40.200]   Again, built-in, they're using some of the best providers
[00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:43.280]   in the business to do all of that stuff.
[00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:46.400]   Fulfill orders, manage product inventory, resolve customer
[00:53:46.400 --> 00:53:46.760]   issues.
[00:53:46.760 --> 00:53:50.800]   You can even do it from your Squarespace app on iOS or Android.
[00:53:50.800 --> 00:53:53.040]   They have a commerce app.
[00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:55.720]   So you're on the go, and you're handling customer inquiries.
[00:53:55.720 --> 00:53:56.800]   That's awesome.
[00:53:56.800 --> 00:54:01.160]   Power your business with the best Squarespace commerce.
[00:54:01.160 --> 00:54:04.720]   There's a basic plan, an advanced plan.
[00:54:04.720 --> 00:54:07.560]   Great features, whatever size your business is.
[00:54:07.560 --> 00:54:09.480]   And they'll grow with your business.
[00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:11.480]   And of course, you're accepting payments instantly.
[00:54:11.480 --> 00:54:13.720]   Plus, all the great stuff Squarespace usually
[00:54:13.720 --> 00:54:15.960]   offers free domains with an annual purchase,
[00:54:15.960 --> 00:54:18.160]   professional design, the ability, though,
[00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:20.000]   to go under the hood and get geeky with it.
[00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:22.240]   They've a full developer platform.
[00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:26.360]   24/7 customer support from Squarespace directly
[00:54:26.360 --> 00:54:28.400]   from their offices.
[00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:30.120]   Everything is great about Squarespace.
[00:54:30.120 --> 00:54:30.640]   I love it.
[00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:32.880]   I'm happy-- a happy, happy Squarespace customer.
[00:54:32.880 --> 00:54:34.040]   You will be too.
[00:54:34.040 --> 00:54:39.360]   So try it for free, squarespace.com.
[00:54:39.360 --> 00:54:40.840]   Make sure you use the offer code TWIT.
[00:54:40.840 --> 00:54:43.800]   You'll get 10% off when you buy.
[00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:44.680]   So try it free.
[00:54:44.680 --> 00:54:48.720]   But if you decide to buy, the offer code is TWIT 10% off.

[00:54:50.360 --> 00:54:52.240]   And we have such a great relationship with them.
[00:54:52.240 --> 00:54:53.560]   We have been with them for so long.
[00:54:53.560 --> 00:54:59.480]   Squarespace.com, the place to make your next website.
[00:54:59.480 --> 00:55:00.520]   Thank you, Uncle Leo.
[00:55:00.520 --> 00:55:02.560]   I drank all the Soylint that was in the back.
[00:55:02.560 --> 00:55:05.160]   Tastes just like graham crackers, yeah.
[00:55:05.160 --> 00:55:07.320]   I'm Becky Worley, @bwerley on Twitter,
[00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:11.480]   joined by Christina Warren of Gizmodo and Odakta
[00:55:11.480 --> 00:55:14.360]   and Jason Heiner of Tech Republic.
[00:55:14.360 --> 00:55:19.520]   Guys, it's a big week, a big time of the year for drones.
[00:55:19.520 --> 00:55:21.040]   You know, we're going into the holiday season.
[00:55:21.040 --> 00:55:23.880]   So the hardware is rolling out so people
[00:55:23.880 --> 00:55:25.120]   can start thinking about what they're
[00:55:25.120 --> 00:55:27.600]   going to buy on the Black Friday.
[00:55:27.600 --> 00:55:33.560]   DJI this week came out with the Mavic, foldable $1,000 drone.
[00:55:33.560 --> 00:55:35.520]   Fits in the palm of your hand.
[00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:40.800]   Without the controller, you can get it for $750.
[00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:42.800]   If you get it with the controller,
[00:55:42.800 --> 00:55:44.360]   you can wedge your phone in.
[00:55:44.360 --> 00:55:46.840]   And the phone gives you a viewer for the drone's camera.
[00:55:46.840 --> 00:55:48.400]   That's the $1,000 option.
[00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:51.840]   As a built-in camera, follow me function.
[00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:53.840]   It has a gimbal on it.
[00:55:53.840 --> 00:55:57.440]   For something mile radius, I can't remember exactly what--
[00:55:57.440 --> 00:56:01.640]   you can go four miles from the controller.
[00:56:01.640 --> 00:56:05.040]   Now, what's interesting here is the Karma from GoPro
[00:56:05.040 --> 00:56:07.680]   announced last week.
[00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:11.320]   Roughly about the same, it's about $1,100 when it's bundled
[00:56:11.320 --> 00:56:13.600]   with the GoPro Hero 5 Black.
[00:56:13.600 --> 00:56:16.480]   Again, gimbal stabilized.
[00:56:16.480 --> 00:56:20.520]   Although you can remove that and have sort of a gyroscopic
[00:56:20.520 --> 00:56:25.600]   stabilizer if you want with the GoPro Karma.
[00:56:25.600 --> 00:56:30.280]   So is it fair to be comparing apples to oranges here
[00:56:30.280 --> 00:56:32.880]   when we're looking at these two pieces of hardware, Christina?
[00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:37.000]   And is GoPro grasping at straws here,
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:39.680]   trying to do this as an all-in-one?
[00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:41.160]   I don't know if they're grasping at straws,
[00:56:41.160 --> 00:56:45.560]   but I do think that they are two different products.
[00:56:45.560 --> 00:56:48.560]   But I think they end up trying to accomplish the same thing.
[00:56:48.560 --> 00:56:52.760]   So I think GoPro is in a little bit of an interesting position
[00:56:52.760 --> 00:56:54.840]   and that they have a lot of people coming at them
[00:56:54.840 --> 00:56:55.680]   from all sides.
[00:56:55.680 --> 00:56:58.520]   You have drone makers, you have other gimbal things.
[00:56:58.520 --> 00:57:00.400]   You have, frankly, smartphones.
[00:57:00.400 --> 00:57:02.760]   You have a lot of people who are doing these things.
[00:57:02.760 --> 00:57:05.640]   And they used to be in a unique position.
[00:57:05.640 --> 00:57:07.960]   And now their product has become commoditized.
[00:57:07.960 --> 00:57:11.320]   So it's hard to say.
[00:57:11.320 --> 00:57:14.480]   Oh, Dr. Are we looking at drones as being sort
[00:57:14.480 --> 00:57:17.360]   of old news and they were a fun toy for a while.
[00:57:17.360 --> 00:57:18.720]   And then, meh.
[00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:22.400]   So I am on record at yelling at Uncle Leo repeatedly
[00:57:22.400 --> 00:57:24.200]   on the show as a drone hater.
[00:57:24.200 --> 00:57:25.160]   I don't like drones.
[00:57:25.160 --> 00:57:26.640]   They drop bombs on people.
[00:57:26.640 --> 00:57:29.400]   They stalk people and they show me firework things
[00:57:29.400 --> 00:57:30.920]   that I saw one year and that was good enough
[00:57:30.920 --> 00:57:32.120]   to put her on a loop.
[00:57:32.120 --> 00:57:35.720]   But I will say that these two drones are awesome.
[00:57:35.720 --> 00:57:37.960]   And I wanted these DIY drone in my life.
[00:57:37.960 --> 00:57:41.120]   I need a, I'm now a hypocrite because this is what I want.
[00:57:41.120 --> 00:57:44.000]   I wanted a drone that was small enough to fit in my pocket
[00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:46.240]   to follow me like a dog and to be my friend
[00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:47.560]   when I have no friends.
[00:57:47.560 --> 00:57:49.240]   This little drone is amazing.
[00:57:49.240 --> 00:57:52.720]   Now, GoPro's problem was that GoPro was a victim
[00:57:52.720 --> 00:57:53.800]   of their own success.
[00:57:53.800 --> 00:57:55.560]   They made something that was awesome.
[00:57:55.560 --> 00:57:57.680]   And people stopped buying new GoPros.
[00:57:57.680 --> 00:57:59.640]   They're like, why do I need a new GoPro?
[00:57:59.640 --> 00:58:02.760]   This one shoot 4K was the oven 4K unlimited.
[00:58:02.760 --> 00:58:04.200]   Like you just start making up stuff.
[00:58:04.200 --> 00:58:05.080]   It's the same thing.
[00:58:05.080 --> 00:58:06.160]   So people stopped buying it.
[00:58:06.160 --> 00:58:08.000]   So now they got to expand their market,
[00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:09.760]   expand their brand to go get it.
[00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:11.440]   Some of the other people as Christina said,
[00:58:11.440 --> 00:58:12.440]   were coming after them.
[00:58:12.440 --> 00:58:14.680]   So now they're going out there trying to expand themselves.
[00:58:14.680 --> 00:58:15.960]   And their drone looks cool.
[00:58:15.960 --> 00:58:16.800]   Their drone's great.
[00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:18.280]   It comes out with a detachable gimbal.
[00:58:18.280 --> 00:58:19.120]   But guess what?
[00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:20.560]   My big butt ain't going down no mountain size.
[00:58:20.560 --> 00:58:21.760]   I don't need that.
[00:58:21.760 --> 00:58:24.240]   I need that DJI or I could go like this.
[00:58:24.240 --> 00:58:25.480]   And I can wave it like that.
[00:58:25.480 --> 00:58:27.000]   Like I said, I need somebody to talk to.
[00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:27.920]   I ain't got that many friends.
[00:58:27.920 --> 00:58:28.760]   People don't like mountain.
[00:58:28.760 --> 00:58:29.600]   I know if you can tell.
[00:58:29.600 --> 00:58:30.440]   I'm crazy.
[00:58:30.440 --> 00:58:32.720]   But if I had a drone that could just do what I wanted it to do,
[00:58:32.720 --> 00:58:34.760]   I needed it in my life.
[00:58:34.760 --> 00:58:37.040]   Anybody wants a domain of my birthday isn't,
[00:58:37.040 --> 00:58:38.120]   it's 15 days.
[00:58:38.120 --> 00:58:40.960]   If you could just send me about 10, $15.
[00:58:40.960 --> 00:58:42.080]   They don't want to take it like 100 of y'all.
[00:58:42.080 --> 00:58:42.920]   I can get one.
[00:58:42.920 --> 00:58:44.000]   I'm just saying, back to the show,
[00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:45.040]   what we talk about drones?
[00:58:45.040 --> 00:58:46.480]   I don't know if you like drones.
[00:58:46.480 --> 00:58:47.320]   Some people do.
[00:58:47.320 --> 00:58:48.160]   Some people don't.
[00:58:48.160 --> 00:58:52.200]   Well, you mentioned that this drone has some recognition,
[00:58:52.200 --> 00:58:53.320]   gesture recognition.
[00:58:53.320 --> 00:58:57.280]   If you make a square around your face, it zooms in.
[00:58:57.280 --> 00:58:59.200]   And you can get a photo of you.
[00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:01.120]   So it's a game will follow you.
[00:59:01.120 --> 00:59:02.920]   See, don't you want a dog?
[00:59:02.920 --> 00:59:05.680]   You want a pet drone is what you really want.
[00:59:05.680 --> 00:59:08.840]   I want to do as little work as possible.
[00:59:08.840 --> 00:59:10.400]   I wake up with these eyebrows like this.
[00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:11.200]   I just draw natural.
[00:59:11.200 --> 00:59:12.680]   I don't want to do no extra work.
[00:59:12.680 --> 00:59:14.360]   If the drone does all the work for me,
[00:59:14.360 --> 00:59:17.240]   all the better for me, these are drones I could live with.
[00:59:17.240 --> 00:59:18.760]   These drones look fun.
[00:59:18.760 --> 00:59:20.520]   I just can't, I mean, Jason, do you see,
[00:59:20.520 --> 00:59:25.760]   we saw that, remember the Lily drone was a big kickstarter
[00:59:25.760 --> 00:59:27.240]   video that they had out?
[00:59:27.240 --> 00:59:31.200]   And it was, like you threw it up in the air
[00:59:31.200 --> 00:59:33.520]   and then you started down the mountain snowboarding
[00:59:33.520 --> 00:59:36.720]   and it would follow you at the perfect distance.
[00:59:36.720 --> 00:59:37.560]   Yeah.
[00:59:37.560 --> 00:59:41.040]   I don't know, I don't feel like that's really materializing
[00:59:41.040 --> 00:59:44.360]   here, but some of this stuff in terms of creating flight
[00:59:44.360 --> 00:59:47.240]   paths that you can pre-program in advance,
[00:59:47.240 --> 00:59:50.840]   having it hone in on the controller and follow the controller.
[00:59:50.840 --> 00:59:52.560]   I don't know if it's snowboard ready,
[00:59:52.560 --> 00:59:55.760]   but it's a lot more functional than some of the really
[00:59:55.760 --> 00:59:59.160]   difficult to pilot drones that I've tried and lost.
[00:59:59.160 --> 01:00:00.800]   Yeah.
[01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:01.400]   It's true.
[01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:02.440]   I've never seen one.
[01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:02.960]   It's funny.
[01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:10.560]   It was last year, last August at the Intel developer
[01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:13.080]   forum, IDF in San Francisco.
[01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:15.280]   There's a drone maker, I can't even remember the name of it,
[01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:16.880]   but it was like a bracelet.
[01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:19.640]   The drone was literally wrapped around your wrist.
[01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:20.720]   Oh, right, I saw that.
[01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:21.240]   Yeah.
[01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:22.160]   I remember that.
[01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:24.160]   You know, and you chuck it right in the air
[01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:27.160]   and it automatically sees you and follows you
[01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:29.680]   and it connects to your phone and sends the photos.
[01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:34.240]   Nixia was called the first wearable camera that can fly.
[01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:36.640]   Perfect, perfect.
[01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:37.440]   But I don't know if that--
[01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:39.400]   There is so much vaporware here, holy crap.
[01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:40.840]   There is so much.
[01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:41.840]   Exactly.
[01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:42.840]   Exactly.
[01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:44.840]   And that's the difference we were talking about with Lilly.
[01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:47.280]   These are two companies that are viable and putting out
[01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:47.800]   the product.
[01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:49.320]   I was going to say these are actually out.
[01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:50.920]   These are real like that Lilly thing.
[01:00:50.920 --> 01:00:51.960]   I thought the Lilly thing was cool.
[01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:53.480]   I'm like, oh, Lilly's playing soccer.
[01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:56.000]   I put the little bracelet on her to file her on the field.
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:57.000]   I can get some great footage.
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:57.480]   Guess what?
[01:00:57.480 --> 01:00:58.600]   Thing never came out.
[01:00:58.600 --> 01:00:59.960]   Stuff you waiting on doesn't happen.
[01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:02.320]   But DJI knows what they're doing.
[01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:03.600]   GoPro knows what they're doing.
[01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:04.800]   We're going to get these products.
[01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:06.280]   And these products are actually going
[01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:11.120]   to all those elusive features that will help the average person
[01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:13.080]   get into drone wear.
[01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:16.360]   Christine, I know one of the things
[01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:19.120]   that GoPro has been trying to do is to market their cameras,
[01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:24.080]   their products more to families as opposed to extreme athletes.
[01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:28.560]   And while this drone definitely helps them create
[01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:32.080]   more vertical penetration in that extreme athlete market,
[01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:35.080]   it doesn't really help them with the moms.
[01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:37.240]   No, I'm not a parent.
[01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:39.480]   But yeah, I don't really see--
[01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:40.120]   I think of anything.
[01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:42.760]   It almost was-- it potentially even makes it scarier.
[01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:44.400]   I mean, I think that--
[01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:46.320]   not scarier, but I guess less appealing.
[01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:48.160]   Because you're like, oh, I've got the spying thing.
[01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:53.000]   And do I want this around my kids or my pets or whatever?
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.920]   Whereas I think you're right, because GoPro has
[01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:57.680]   been trying to kind of say, hey, this is this perfect thing
[01:01:57.680 --> 01:01:58.800]   to take on vacation with you.
[01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:00.600]   And you can do all these other things with it.
[01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:02.280]   And it'll capture moments that you wouldn't
[01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:03.800]   be able to capture in other ways.
[01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:05.640]   I guess they could sell it potentially that way.
[01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:07.320]   If you've got this really easy to use drone,
[01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:10.120]   that you could help capture memories or moments
[01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:13.120]   that you wouldn't be able to capture otherwise.
[01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:13.600]   I don't know.
[01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:16.320]   But I feel like this is definitely--
[01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:21.520]   they see that everybody is strapping a GoPro to a drone
[01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:23.880]   where they're using the cameras that are building
[01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:26.120]   some of these other systems instead of a GoPro.
[01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:28.840]   And they're saying, let's just eliminate the middleman
[01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:32.120]   and just do our all-in-one package, which makes sense.
[01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:36.480]   But people are very committed.
[01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:38.400]   Or a lot of drone heads are very committed
[01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:40.160]   to their brand of choice.
[01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:41.840]   That's an area where DJI definitely
[01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:42.720]   has a huge advantage.
[01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:43.960]   People love their products.
[01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:46.360]   I feel like the barrier to entry with both of these products
[01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:47.880]   is video editing.
[01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:49.040]   I mean, even--
[01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:49.800]   Oh, totally.
[01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:51.280]   Nick would have been at GoPro.
[01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:54.480]   He told me his children's entire childhood
[01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:57.720]   is trapped on SD cards.
[01:02:57.720 --> 01:03:01.480]   Has anybody tried out the new cloud editing software
[01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:02.400]   that GoPro put out?
[01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:06.400]   I mean, it seems like one of those intractable problems
[01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:08.960]   editing that nobody's come up with a good solution
[01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:10.200]   for the consumer.
[01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:12.360]   Yeah, the biggest problem with it, the GoPro's too,
[01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:17.560]   is because of the very fish eye of their camera.
[01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:18.560]   Exactly.
[01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:21.840]   Yeah, you've got to correct it as soon as you import that video.
[01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:22.760]   It's like, oh, yeah.
[01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:25.520]   And then that takes-- it's like a second render, right?
[01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:26.160]   And so--
[01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:27.520]   Totally.
[01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:28.160]   It's pain.
[01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:30.440]   There'd be a huge opportunity for someone like Apple
[01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:33.800]   or even Microsoft that they cared enough to have a filter,
[01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:36.120]   a plug-in that would say, we recognize this,
[01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:37.120]   but it's just coming from a drone.
[01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:38.720]   We're applying the effect.
[01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:40.080]   We're going to help add music to it.
[01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:42.480]   Because that was part of what made eye movies so successful,
[01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:45.040]   and got so many people to just be able to edit movies
[01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:45.680]   the right way.
[01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:47.440]   I think if they'd be willing--
[01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:48.680]   and I don't think that they are,
[01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:51.000]   I think they've all been abandoned by a movie
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:52.600]   to a certain extent--
[01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:54.760]   Mike Karen said, hey, we'll have it plug-in
[01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:56.760]   with your drone stuff or your GoPro stuff.
[01:03:56.760 --> 01:03:59.360]   And Apple and GoPro work together in the past.
[01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:01.160]   That would actually be really smart.
[01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:08.720]   That is one of the things where the mobile app for editing
[01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:12.400]   is better than the application on the computer sometimes.
[01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:15.880]   I have the DJI, and I can edit on my phone.
[01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:18.320]   And sometimes it's just easier, especially for a novice,
[01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:19.680]   just do a couple quick edits.
[01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:21.360]   And you're like, wow, this is pretty good for the phone.
[01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:22.440]   You go load it up on your computer.
[01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:25.520]   I'm like, what is all this, and why is it like this?
[01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:29.320]   They need to have a sound stream, but a dumb down version.
[01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:30.640]   That just works.
[01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:32.360]   And that fish eyes is a huge problem.
[01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:33.720]   That's why I stopped using my GoPro.
[01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:37.200]   Once I got the DJI Osmo, once I got that thing,
[01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:40.160]   I stopped using the GoPro.
[01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:43.760]   My hero, because I didn't feel like that extra render.
[01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:44.440]   And I know better.
[01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:45.920]   I feel like I'm losing quality.
[01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:48.000]   And again, I don't want to lose quality.
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:48.920]   I don't want to extra render.
[01:04:48.920 --> 01:04:50.080]   I ain't got time for that.
[01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:52.400]   So they need to do something, even if it's just
[01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:54.800]   on a mobile platform, because everybody's got a phone nowadays.
[01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:56.400]   The screens are so much bigger.
[01:04:56.400 --> 01:04:59.080]   They need to focus on tightening that up, possibly,
[01:04:59.080 --> 01:04:59.960]   to help people out.
[01:04:59.960 --> 01:05:03.520]   The problem is with that, 4K view, 5 size huge, blah, blah, blah.
[01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:04.600]   That's their job, not ours.
[01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:06.680]   But Christina was on the nose with that partnership.
[01:05:06.680 --> 01:05:06.920]   Thanks.
[01:05:06.920 --> 01:05:08.280]   Somebody should do it.
[01:05:08.280 --> 01:05:12.320]   Well, then that new app, Quick, QUIK, which
[01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:17.840]   is their mobile video editing thing, which has some potential.
[01:05:17.840 --> 01:05:18.560]   It's pretty decent.
[01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:19.560]   Yeah.
[01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:19.560]   Yeah.
[01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:21.120]   That's the one you're talking about, right?
[01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:24.440]   Yeah, that'll be a big change, I think, when hopefully.
[01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:26.960]   I just am amazed at how many videos I have.
[01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:28.920]   When my kids were little, I would take the time
[01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:33.160]   to make-- like, actual make cuts and put music underneath.
[01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:34.360]   And sure.
[01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:35.360]   God, now it's like--
[01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:37.120]   And now you're just like, really?
[01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:38.280]   No.
[01:05:38.280 --> 01:05:39.720]   That's the first kid.
[01:05:39.720 --> 01:05:40.920]   I did that with the first kid.
[01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:42.200]   The first kid sitting up.
[01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:43.560]   Second kid, nothing.
[01:05:43.560 --> 01:05:44.360]   I mean, I look back.
[01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:46.240]   It's like two phone videos from 10 years.
[01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:47.960]   Child did not exist.
[01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:50.400]   Let me look at you all on the face and tell you
[01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:52.600]   that you're horrible parents, and you're not a kid.
[01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:53.400]   Thank you.
[01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:53.880]   OK?
[01:05:53.880 --> 01:05:55.120]   You can go check my Instagram.
[01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:57.360]   I just made a movie with her and her friends at the beach
[01:05:57.360 --> 01:05:57.920]   this summer.
[01:05:57.920 --> 01:05:58.800]   I'm out here making movies.
[01:05:58.800 --> 01:05:59.440]   You know why?
[01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:00.760]   Because I have the skill to do.
[01:06:00.760 --> 01:06:02.440]   You know all these regular bum parents
[01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:03.600]   that don't know about technology?
[01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:05.640]   We are a panel of technologists.
[01:06:05.640 --> 01:06:07.280]   And Christine, you should be doing it for a family member.
[01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:08.640]   You should be like, look, I know you don't know what you're
[01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:09.040]   doing.
[01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:09.720]   Same with the video.
[01:06:09.720 --> 01:06:11.160]   I'm going to make a monetize of the kids.
[01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:12.080]   Be better parents.
[01:06:12.080 --> 01:06:13.440]   Don't know what that's going to be about.
[01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:14.400]   That you're not making these.
[01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:15.680]   I'm still making videos, OK?
[01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:16.760]   You're a selfie dad.
[01:06:16.760 --> 01:06:17.720]   You're good.
[01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:19.240]   We're making all those kids.
[01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:20.520]   You know, be president of the United States.
[01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:22.280]   My girls going to look good in these videos.
[01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:24.000]   You ain't going to see these little stupid hair
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000]   flipping up, not looking videos.
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:27.200]   You know, I got a train.
[01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:28.640]   I'll be like, look, no smile or smile.
[01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:30.360]   Because sometimes we got to look grown.
[01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:31.800]   You know, I'm like, get yourself together
[01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:32.800]   and be better parents.
[01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:33.880]   You got technology.
[01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:36.200]   Oh, PSA, last thing.
[01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:39.400]   For real though, if you have a grandparent or a parent,
[01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:40.920]   you should go and take your phone.
[01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:42.040]   And even if you don't do a video,
[01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:44.280]   audio recording, ask them where they grew up.
[01:06:44.280 --> 01:06:45.680]   Ask them what their first job was.
[01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:48.240]   Ask them about their parents, where they lived, what they did.
[01:06:48.240 --> 01:06:49.840]   My grandmother passed away.
[01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:52.280]   And I've got audio tape about my great grandparents
[01:06:52.280 --> 01:06:53.560]   that I never meet, never know.
[01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:55.360]   And I got information about where she went to school
[01:06:55.360 --> 01:06:56.960]   for her first job, for her date.
[01:06:56.960 --> 01:06:59.240]   I did the same thing with my dad and he passed away.
[01:06:59.240 --> 01:07:00.800]   Now I've got that for my granddaughter.
[01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:01.880]   You got all this technology.
[01:07:01.880 --> 01:07:03.840]   If you're watching this, you're a better person
[01:07:03.840 --> 01:07:05.400]   than most people when it comes to technology.
[01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:06.400]   Do something useful.
[01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:08.760]   Stop taking the subs and talk to the people that made you
[01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:10.040]   and find out where you came from.
[01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:11.160]   So you can have some records.
[01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:12.760]   I know y'all ain't as special as me,
[01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:14.720]   but pretend that they're special interview them anyway
[01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:15.720]   because you love them.
[01:07:15.720 --> 01:07:17.320]   - That is a great idea.
[01:07:17.320 --> 01:07:18.160]   - It's a great idea.
[01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:19.000]   - It is.
[01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.960]   - I did that with my grandmother in 2012.
[01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:26.760]   When my grandmother was terminally ill.
[01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:29.880]   And we spent three, four hours.
[01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:32.840]   And it's funny, I was there just interviewing her
[01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:36.120]   and doing the journalist thing of asking her the questions
[01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:38.400]   that everybody wanted to ask, but never did.
[01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:42.040]   And she was perfectly happy to answer it.
[01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:43.880]   And it's funny, the longer we were there,
[01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:46.680]   the more people kept coming over to visit.
[01:07:46.680 --> 01:07:48.240]   And everybody would stay.
[01:07:48.240 --> 01:07:50.920]   And by the end, it was like she was holding court
[01:07:50.920 --> 01:07:53.600]   and for like three or four hours,
[01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:56.440]   I expected it to be like 30 minutes or something.
[01:07:56.440 --> 01:07:59.440]   And but because of that, we learned so much more about her
[01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:01.480]   and about our family and about, you know,
[01:08:01.480 --> 01:08:03.120]   America and the way it's changed.
[01:08:03.120 --> 01:08:07.960]   And especially for women because she was a working woman
[01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:11.200]   like in the 1950s, which a lot of people in our family
[01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:14.000]   had no idea of, all kinds of things.
[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:17.320]   And that four hours of doing that,
[01:08:17.320 --> 01:08:19.920]   it's one of the best things I've ever done with technology
[01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:22.640]   in my life, one of the best uses,
[01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:24.640]   is doing something that now the rest of our family
[01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:29.360]   really, you know, treasures and other people will know her,
[01:08:29.360 --> 01:08:30.640]   even though that never knew her.
[01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:33.720]   And so it's super great idea.
[01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:34.960]   Best use of that.
[01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:38.360]   - I haven't done it yet, but I downloaded the StoryCorps app
[01:08:38.360 --> 01:08:42.400]   for my kids to interview my mother-in-law.
[01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:43.800]   'Cause I think it would be really neat.
[01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:47.200]   She's, you know, she's 86 and lived through World War II
[01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:50.280]   in London, and I just think it would be so neat
[01:08:50.280 --> 01:08:52.240]   to have them record that.
[01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:53.840]   And what's nice about that StoryCorps app
[01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:56.280]   is that it also provides suggested questions
[01:08:56.280 --> 01:08:59.320]   if you're not sure how to get, you know,
[01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:00.440]   'cause sometimes if you just say, like,
[01:09:00.440 --> 01:09:02.480]   tell me your life story can be really dry
[01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:04.920]   and I moved here and then I moved there.
[01:09:04.920 --> 01:09:06.800]   But these are questions like, you know,
[01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:09.880]   what was a time that you felt happiest in your life?
[01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:13.400]   Or, so it's just some really great things.
[01:09:13.400 --> 01:09:16.320]   So nice PSA, oh, doctor, I appreciate that.
[01:09:17.320 --> 01:09:20.200]   Now I think I'm really loading up for the next story,
[01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:23.000]   which is really leading us in the completely different direction
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:24.760]   to an epic rant.
[01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:27.040]   Not that you haven't done that already, Owen.
[01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:29.080]   I'm just, I'm opening the door for some more here.
[01:09:29.080 --> 01:09:30.600]   - The chat room thinks I've had too much coffee.
[01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:32.920]   I just been packing all week and I haven't had much sleep
[01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:35.960]   and I'm excited to be here with such lovely people.
[01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:37.800]   I'm not, it's okay, I'm gonna be alright.
[01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:38.640]   I'm not gonna explode.
[01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:39.480]   - You need to vent.
[01:09:39.480 --> 01:09:40.320]   - That's alright.
[01:09:40.320 --> 01:09:41.160]   - You need to vent.
[01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:42.000]   - That's gonna mess me off.
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.200]   - I'm gonna take Christina up for this next one.
[01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:45.040]   (laughs)
[01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:47.960]   Because this story that I covered this week,
[01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:50.480]   a venture capitalist from Santa Barbara,
[01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:51.960]   member of Ringcom Partners,
[01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:54.640]   he wrote an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal
[01:09:54.640 --> 01:09:58.640]   and he suggested that if women want equal treatment
[01:09:58.640 --> 01:10:03.640]   in the VC world, that he, that, I'll quote here,
[01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:06.240]   he said, "In your LinkedIn profile, Twitter account,
[01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:08.520]   "email address and online correspondence,
[01:10:08.520 --> 01:10:11.560]   "use your initials or unisex name,
[01:10:11.560 --> 01:10:13.600]   "implying that you should hide your gender,
[01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:16.200]   "and eliminate all photos."
[01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:18.200]   So basically what he went on to say
[01:10:18.200 --> 01:10:20.680]   is that there is so much implicit bias
[01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:22.480]   against women in technology
[01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:24.520]   that you should hide your identity,
[01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:27.880]   hide the identity of any women on your team
[01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:31.320]   if you want equal treatment and equal funding.
[01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:34.520]   Yeah, even I was shocked.
[01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:38.320]   I couldn't believe that this is happening in 2016.
[01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:41.560]   I also couldn't believe that this would be published
[01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:43.240]   in the Wall Street Journal.
[01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:46.400]   Yeah, I mean, if I can be honest,
[01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:48.840]   I wasn't that surprised that the op-ed was published
[01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:50.960]   on the editorial page of the Wall Street Journal.
[01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:53.840]   I mean, you know, they, whatever their standards are,
[01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:56.920]   I mean, I was, I was surprised and I wasn't surprised.
[01:10:56.920 --> 01:10:59.800]   I saw it and I read it and like everyone else,
[01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:01.440]   I was incensed and I couldn't believe
[01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:03.880]   that someone would actually have the,
[01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:05.920]   of course, you know, people think those things,
[01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:08.000]   but it's shocking that someone would actually
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:09.960]   not only write it, but write it in such a way
[01:11:09.960 --> 01:11:12.520]   that you thought he thought he was giving great advice.
[01:11:12.520 --> 01:11:13.640]   He thought he was helped.
[01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:14.560]   Oh, Dr. Jesus.
[01:11:14.560 --> 01:11:18.200]   Oh, Dr., you have a visual point that you'd like to make here?
[01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:20.840]   I'm just trying to turn up the contrast
[01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:23.280]   because I, I as a black man also have that problem
[01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:24.480]   in the tech community.
[01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:25.720]   So I figured that turned out to have that.
[01:11:25.720 --> 01:11:29.080]   Oh, Dr. Has toilet paper over his head, over his face.
[01:11:29.080 --> 01:11:31.000]   I'm just trying to get as light as possible.
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:32.640]   My name is very Caucasian.
[01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:34.600]   So when I call people and they say,
[01:11:34.600 --> 01:11:36.160]   oh, and stone, then I show up and they're like,
[01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:37.920]   oh, more and I'm like, nah, it's Owen.
[01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:38.920]   I got you.
[01:11:38.920 --> 01:11:40.800]   (laughing)
[01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:42.160]   Oh, my, didn't you?
[01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:43.000]   But it's Owen.
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.600]   See, my dad knew what he was doing when he named me that.
[01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:47.040]   This is deplorable thing.
[01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:47.920]   It's disgusting.
[01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:49.200]   It makes me so sad.
[01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:50.920]   I'm raising a ninja.
[01:11:50.920 --> 01:11:52.960]   She has been told two things since birth.
[01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:54.200]   You have to become an engineer.
[01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:55.440]   I don't care what kind.
[01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:57.960]   And you have to have two black belts if you want a date
[01:11:57.960 --> 01:12:00.040]   because the world is against women.
[01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:02.240]   And especially if you, if you double that up
[01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:04.280]   and put some tan on it, it's even worse.
[01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:07.240]   But the fact that someone would say this to a woman means,
[01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:10.320]   why don't you yell at the people who treat the women this way
[01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:12.720]   and set up the women to be something different
[01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:13.560]   than they already are,
[01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:15.520]   which is powerful in their own right?
[01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:16.640]   And if you just gave them a chance,
[01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:17.480]   maybe they take your job.
[01:12:17.480 --> 01:12:18.320]   I don't know.
[01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:19.160]   You scared, you scared.
[01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:20.400]   - Well, and also let me just say this.
[01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:21.920]   This is a guy who's a venture capitalist.
[01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:23.640]   And so he's someone who's part of the problem.
[01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:25.840]   And rather than saying, and instead of saying,
[01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:28.760]   I can be open to my own, you know, implicit biases
[01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:30.720]   and I can look at how I view things
[01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:33.680]   and maybe be open to, you know,
[01:12:33.680 --> 01:12:34.560]   viewing things in a certain way.
[01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:35.600]   He's saying, no, actually, you know,
[01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:39.560]   but there's no way that I can overcome my own objections
[01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:42.840]   and my own, you know, I guess,
[01:12:42.840 --> 01:12:45.440]   thoughts of what a female engineer is.
[01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:47.280]   And it wasn't just women.
[01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:49.160]   He was also basically implicitly saying anybody
[01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:50.760]   who was different religions to,
[01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:54.000]   there was that aspect to it too, which was really gross.
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:55.120]   Anybody who had a different name,
[01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:57.080]   anybody who had a seemingly different background,
[01:12:57.080 --> 01:12:59.120]   basically hide and be as, you know,
[01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:01.640]   like, you know, white male as possible
[01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:03.120]   is basically what he was saying.
[01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:04.200]   Rather than saying, though, you know,
[01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:05.640]   that he can be part of the solution
[01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:08.560]   and be open to meeting people who had different backgrounds.
[01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:09.920]   He's saying, no, actually, the only way
[01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:11.480]   you're gonna get a meeting with me
[01:13:11.480 --> 01:13:15.520]   is if I go by Chris Warren and I, you know,
[01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:17.480]   that only way, I personally would be able to get a meeting
[01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:18.760]   with him is if I went by Chris Warren
[01:13:18.760 --> 01:13:20.840]   and I switched my Twitter handle,
[01:13:20.840 --> 01:13:22.760]   I could no longer be film underscore a girl, you know,
[01:13:22.760 --> 01:13:24.080]   because that wouldn't work.
[01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:27.400]   And would have to hide every part of my identity.
[01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:28.880]   And that would be, you know,
[01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:30.760]   use generic photos on your team page.
[01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:32.600]   And that's the only way you're going to get a meeting.
[01:13:32.600 --> 01:13:33.760]   And it's just so gross.
[01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:36.120]   I mean, it was interesting because his partners
[01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:38.080]   at his VC firm, which I've never heard of,
[01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:39.400]   but, you know, they're small,
[01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:41.680]   immediately disavowed him and were like,
[01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:43.520]   we don't stand by anything, he says.
[01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:47.520]   And he, of course, was forced to apologize two days later.
[01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:49.160]   And basically, you know,
[01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:50.440]   the Wall Street Journal has now attached
[01:13:50.440 --> 01:13:53.800]   that apology to the op-ed, but it's still there.
[01:13:53.800 --> 01:13:55.280]   But it's just, it's insane to me
[01:13:55.280 --> 01:13:57.040]   that he thought that it was okay,
[01:13:57.040 --> 01:14:00.040]   not only as it, not only to say, but as advice.
[01:14:00.040 --> 01:14:01.920]   I mean, I think he genuinely went into this
[01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:03.920]   in a place where he thought that this was good advice,
[01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:05.160]   where he thought, oh, you know, things,
[01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:06.760]   the real solution here,
[01:14:06.760 --> 01:14:09.600]   because there's no way that the people in these decisions
[01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:10.840]   who are making decisions to take money
[01:14:10.840 --> 01:14:12.640]   or to hire people or whatever,
[01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:14.840]   there's no way they can go over themselves.
[01:14:14.840 --> 01:14:17.800]   So what you have to do is you have to trick them.
[01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:20.760]   And how demoralizing for anybody who's trying to raise money
[01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:22.320]   or anybody who's trying to get a job
[01:14:22.320 --> 01:14:25.040]   to hear that this is what people who are making those decisions.
[01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:28.840]   And these are people who are in positions of how are think.
[01:14:28.840 --> 01:14:31.160]   But it's gross and it's grotesque.
[01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:35.200]   And I mean, you know, there are a couple of initials
[01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:40.200]   that I could use to describe my response to him.
[01:14:40.200 --> 01:14:41.760]   - Have you worn? - Basically.
[01:14:41.760 --> 01:14:43.360]   - Yeah, basically.
[01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:47.680]   - It's like, look as white male as you possibly can.
[01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:48.920]   Done, so good advice.
[01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:52.200]   - You know, Sarah Lacey pointed out,
[01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:54.440]   I think it was Sarah Lacey pointed this out on Twitter
[01:14:54.440 --> 01:14:58.800]   that neither he nor his firm has a great track record
[01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:00.360]   funding women.
[01:15:00.360 --> 01:15:03.000]   - Shocker. - Yeah, amazing.
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:04.720]   And I think the guy issued what may be
[01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:07.720]   the fastest apology in Twitter history,
[01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:09.200]   which is so interesting the way he did this.
[01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:11.400]   So let me read the apology first.
[01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:14.160]   It says, "I apologize for the dreadful article
[01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:15.720]   "I wrote in the Wall Street Journal.
[01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:19.640]   "I told women to endure the gender bias,
[01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:21.320]   "to endure the gender bias problem,
[01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:23.600]   "rather than acting to fix the problem.
[01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:26.640]   "I hurt women and I utterly failed to help.
[01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:28.440]   "I wholly regret, I apologize.
[01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:29.560]   "Women have a tough enough time.
[01:15:29.560 --> 01:15:30.560]   "Having their voices heard.
[01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:31.840]   "Am I insensitive comments?
[01:15:31.840 --> 01:15:33.000]   "Only made matters worse.
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:34.600]   "I'm truly sorry, dash John."
[01:15:34.600 --> 01:15:38.000]   What's so amazing about this is it was a picture
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:39.760]   that he posted. - Yeah.
[01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:41.440]   - And so what I'm trying to figure out
[01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:43.760]   is that because he wanted more characters
[01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:46.520]   or because he didn't want the text search.
[01:15:46.520 --> 01:15:47.360]   - Search. - Okay, so.
[01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:48.240]   - That's a great point.
[01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:52.440]   - So I believe it's because he wanted the full text shown.
[01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:56.160]   I believe that whatever amazing female PR person
[01:15:56.160 --> 01:15:58.840]   that wrote that for him suggested that he do that,
[01:15:58.840 --> 01:16:02.120]   I don't give him credit or smart enough compensation
[01:16:02.120 --> 01:16:04.440]   or considerations to even figure out that conversation.
[01:16:04.440 --> 01:16:06.680]   Whether he should have the text searchable or the picture.
[01:16:06.680 --> 01:16:08.960]   I assume that someone told him what to do
[01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:12.080]   and he copied and pasted or slid his laptop over
[01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:13.680]   and let them go because obviously
[01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:15.400]   he's not smart enough to do what he's supposed to do.
[01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:18.520]   So first of all, if you're a man, then be a man.
[01:16:18.520 --> 01:16:20.680]   You have no apologize that quickly shows the fact
[01:16:20.680 --> 01:16:22.720]   that you were just insensitive and stupid because--
[01:16:22.720 --> 01:16:24.160]   - Never should have written as you begin with.
[01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:25.600]   - The position that you were in
[01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:26.720]   and you want to write an article,
[01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:28.080]   here's how you write an article.
[01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:30.160]   "I am a man, I'm a white male
[01:16:30.160 --> 01:16:32.240]   "and a white male driven industry
[01:16:32.240 --> 01:16:34.840]   "and I feel that women aren't being serviced enough
[01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:35.680]   "in this community.
[01:16:35.680 --> 01:16:38.680]   "So myself and my team are looking for women
[01:16:38.680 --> 01:16:42.000]   "to pitch things to us so we can reach out to you
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:43.520]   "and the community to help you.
[01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:46.720]   "And we are looking to hire three female engineers
[01:16:46.720 --> 01:16:48.520]   "for the companies that we've invested in
[01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:50.200]   "because we believe the opportunity
[01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:52.080]   "is the way to help you lift yourself up.
[01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:53.560]   "You could have said that been a hero,
[01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:55.480]   "probably got two girls to ask for your number.
[01:16:55.480 --> 01:16:57.720]   "But instead, women around the world hate you
[01:16:57.720 --> 01:17:00.000]   "and I hate you and I think you're a moron
[01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:03.560]   "as soon as the PR person that you paid 20 grand to,
[01:17:03.560 --> 01:17:05.240]   "things that you're stupid too.
[01:17:05.240 --> 01:17:07.000]   "You doofus, my goofus."
[01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.160]   - I can't.
[01:17:09.160 --> 01:17:10.080]   I think the thing is--
[01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:10.920]   - I can't believe it.
[01:17:10.920 --> 01:17:12.120]   - Reminding me of,
[01:17:12.120 --> 01:17:14.120]   it's a bit of an extreme example,
[01:17:14.120 --> 01:17:17.600]   but it reminded me of the thing, like in college, right?
[01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:21.120]   You go to college and there's all these things,
[01:17:21.120 --> 01:17:23.560]   or at least this is the way it was when I went to college,
[01:17:23.560 --> 01:17:26.080]   which has admittedly been a while now.
[01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:28.400]   There was all these things about,
[01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:32.960]   here's how you avoid being sexually assaulted, right?
[01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:34.720]   When in fact, it's like,
[01:17:34.720 --> 01:17:36.560]   how do we, should it be mentioned?
[01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:39.040]   - How do we teach people not to sexually assault others?
[01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:41.440]   - Exactly, the messages,
[01:17:41.440 --> 01:17:44.400]   tell people, do not sexually assault someone.
[01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:48.160]   No means no, you know, implicitly.
[01:17:48.160 --> 01:17:50.920]   - Yeah, the conversation should be,
[01:17:50.920 --> 01:17:54.160]   why is it such a white boys club?
[01:17:54.160 --> 01:17:57.840]   - Not, how can we sneak into the white boys club?
[01:17:57.840 --> 01:18:00.600]   - Precisely, and I think that the fact that it's even
[01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:02.520]   was tamed this way, and there's some people
[01:18:02.520 --> 01:18:03.680]   in the chat room and saying,
[01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:04.880]   "Oh, I think it was a good advice."
[01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:06.640]   No, it's not a good advice, it's terrible advice,
[01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:08.480]   because it doesn't solve the fundamental problem.
[01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:09.600]   Yes, the problem is there.
[01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:11.200]   Yes, there is implicit bias.
[01:18:11.200 --> 01:18:12.960]   Yes, it's getting worse and not better,
[01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:15.320]   because fewer women are graduating with CS degrees.
[01:18:15.320 --> 01:18:16.960]   We should be looking at all these things
[01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:18.960]   and talking about that and not saying,
[01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:21.200]   "Well, we gotta trick the system to get into the door,"
[01:18:21.200 --> 01:18:23.640]   because instead we should be having serious conversations
[01:18:23.640 --> 01:18:26.200]   about why every year their industry has more female graduates
[01:18:26.200 --> 01:18:27.920]   and is becoming close to parity,
[01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:29.760]   except for computer science, except for tech.
[01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:33.480]   And the whole notion of a meritocracy is clearly false,
[01:18:33.480 --> 01:18:35.400]   because it's not true, and there have been studies
[01:18:35.400 --> 01:18:36.960]   that show that when you have female founders,
[01:18:36.960 --> 01:18:38.080]   companies actually do better.
[01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:41.000]   So that way, if you were really about showing things
[01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.800]   like that, then you would have VC funds
[01:18:43.800 --> 01:18:45.160]   that would wanna hire more women.
[01:18:45.160 --> 01:18:47.280]   Instead, you have people including,
[01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:48.400]   I don't wanna turn this political,
[01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:50.600]   but presidential candidates who are saying things like,
[01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:51.640]   "Well, you know, it's an inconvenience
[01:18:51.640 --> 01:18:55.160]   for the business to have someone who's pregnant."
[01:18:55.160 --> 01:18:57.520]   And you have these sorts of,
[01:18:57.520 --> 01:18:59.560]   these things that are happening in this world,
[01:18:59.560 --> 01:19:02.360]   to have an article written in the number one,
[01:19:02.360 --> 01:19:04.160]   you know, business newspaper in the country,
[01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:05.640]   to be on the op-ed page,
[01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:07.800]   Fronton Center saying, "Yeah, sorry about that.
[01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:10.840]   You need to hide everything about yourself."
[01:19:10.840 --> 01:19:12.880]   And that's the only way you can maybe trick your way
[01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:15.280]   to get in, maybe that's okay.
[01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:17.360]   It's not good advice, it's insulting.
[01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:20.240]   - Shocking to me, I didn't realize,
[01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:24.080]   someone who actually is doing something positive this week,
[01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:27.880]   Melinda Gates interviewed in a back channel.
[01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:30.760]   She said, "When I was in school in the '80s,
[01:19:30.760 --> 01:19:32.920]   she's a computer science major,
[01:19:32.920 --> 01:19:36.360]   women got about 37% of computer science degrees
[01:19:36.360 --> 01:19:37.880]   and law degrees then.
[01:19:37.880 --> 01:19:41.800]   Law went up to 47% now.
[01:19:41.800 --> 01:19:48.200]   Computer science is now 18% from 37% in the '80s."
[01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:51.640]   I had no idea that it had gone down that much.
[01:19:51.640 --> 01:19:52.680]   - It's gone, absolutely.
[01:19:52.680 --> 01:19:54.960]   I mean, part of it, it's hard to do one-to-one
[01:19:54.960 --> 01:19:56.920]   because there are a lot more graduates
[01:19:56.920 --> 01:19:59.040]   in computer science now versus 30 years ago,
[01:19:59.040 --> 01:20:02.680]   but it's more than halved and it's depressing.
[01:20:02.680 --> 01:20:05.840]   And I think a lot of it comes down to people feeling
[01:20:05.840 --> 01:20:07.800]   as if it is a couple of things.
[01:20:07.800 --> 01:20:10.680]   I think that early on, before it was seen
[01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:14.800]   as a prestige degree, you would see a more even mix.
[01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:17.200]   Even in the '70s, when it was still kind of starting out,
[01:20:17.200 --> 01:20:19.720]   you would see computer science was just starting out.
[01:20:19.720 --> 01:20:22.720]   You would see more even numbers in the '80s
[01:20:22.720 --> 01:20:26.760]   and as it became higher pain and more prestige degree,
[01:20:26.760 --> 01:20:29.360]   you started to see women get pushed out
[01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:30.880]   and less of an interest.
[01:20:30.880 --> 01:20:32.640]   And I think that you see it a lot of times
[01:20:32.640 --> 01:20:34.200]   from recruitment from high schools,
[01:20:34.200 --> 01:20:37.320]   from middle schools, that's why having organizations
[01:20:37.320 --> 01:20:40.840]   like App Camp for Girls and programs that are encouraging
[01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:42.960]   girls at a young age who are interested in coding
[01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:44.600]   and having an outlet to do that are important
[01:20:44.600 --> 01:20:46.200]   so that they already have those skills
[01:20:46.200 --> 01:20:47.200]   when they're starting out.
[01:20:47.200 --> 01:20:48.880]   Dad's like, oh, and who are encouraging
[01:20:48.880 --> 01:20:50.720]   their daughters at a young age to do whatever they want
[01:20:50.720 --> 01:20:53.560]   because there is a thing where people are told,
[01:20:53.560 --> 01:20:54.400]   or girls are told.
[01:20:54.400 --> 01:20:57.080]   And I know this as a girl who was coding
[01:20:57.080 --> 01:20:59.840]   when I was younger, where people look at you weird
[01:20:59.840 --> 01:21:01.960]   and they think that it's odd and they discourage you.
[01:21:01.960 --> 01:21:03.840]   And I know what it's like to be in computer programming
[01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:05.320]   classes where you're the only female
[01:21:05.320 --> 01:21:06.960]   and there is my progress.
[01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:09.240]   - I mean, when I was taking just the introduction
[01:21:09.240 --> 01:21:11.000]   to computer science doing my masters,
[01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:14.120]   I can remember being in the lab at midnight.
[01:21:14.120 --> 01:21:15.560]   I was the only girl there.
[01:21:15.560 --> 01:21:17.720]   I was so frustrated and you know that place
[01:21:17.720 --> 01:21:19.200]   when you're coding and you're trying to figure out
[01:21:19.200 --> 01:21:20.680]   how do I get from point A to point B
[01:21:20.680 --> 01:21:22.920]   and I feel like I'm a total roadblock
[01:21:22.920 --> 01:21:25.320]   and you need people with you that you can turn to
[01:21:25.320 --> 01:21:27.960]   and it helps when just to be explicit,
[01:21:27.960 --> 01:21:29.440]   like there are other people like you
[01:21:29.440 --> 01:21:31.320]   you're like, I'm confused.
[01:21:31.320 --> 01:21:33.200]   And you feel intimidated because you're a woman
[01:21:33.200 --> 01:21:35.000]   and you're like, I should be getting this.
[01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:39.640]   And I just remember that being a real thing.
[01:21:39.640 --> 01:21:42.120]   Let's go back to this Melinda Gates thing.
[01:21:42.120 --> 01:21:46.440]   She has said that she's gonna take two years to apply
[01:21:46.440 --> 01:21:48.360]   everything she's learned through the Gates Foundation
[01:21:48.360 --> 01:21:49.720]   and all the philanthropy that she's done
[01:21:49.720 --> 01:21:53.000]   and she's gonna apply resources that she has at her disposal
[01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.760]   to collect data on this issue of women.
[01:21:55.760 --> 01:21:56.880]   She's definitely said women.
[01:21:56.880 --> 01:21:58.320]   I don't know if she said women and minorities.
[01:21:58.320 --> 01:21:59.800]   I'd like to know more about that.
[01:21:59.800 --> 01:22:03.280]   But collect data on why gender inequality in the workplace,
[01:22:03.280 --> 01:22:07.000]   especially around computer science is such a prevalent thing.
[01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.040]   So somebody who didn't get it,
[01:22:09.040 --> 01:22:12.560]   who got absolutely beat down by the internet,
[01:22:12.560 --> 01:22:17.080]   somebody who does get it and has a ton of money to put at it.
[01:22:17.080 --> 01:22:19.640]   Hopefully the result is right and the direction is right,
[01:22:19.640 --> 01:22:22.880]   but man, not a great week for that.
[01:22:22.880 --> 01:22:24.600]   - One more thing for everybody who is saying
[01:22:24.600 --> 01:22:26.560]   that he did someone a service.
[01:22:26.560 --> 01:22:28.920]   There's a basic point of,
[01:22:28.920 --> 01:22:30.560]   besides all the things that Christina said
[01:22:30.560 --> 01:22:31.520]   that were right on point,
[01:22:31.520 --> 01:22:33.160]   here's the basic core of something.
[01:22:33.160 --> 01:22:35.520]   If you want a job, the best thing to do
[01:22:35.520 --> 01:22:37.520]   when you go for that job or if you want money,
[01:22:37.520 --> 01:22:38.520]   even worse than a job,
[01:22:38.520 --> 01:22:40.760]   when you go for funding, you're asking somebody for money,
[01:22:40.760 --> 01:22:43.680]   the best thing to do is not lie, okay?
[01:22:43.680 --> 01:22:45.720]   So they ask about the numbers of the product
[01:22:45.720 --> 01:22:47.080]   and how many people you got signed up for,
[01:22:47.080 --> 01:22:48.520]   it's best not to lie.
[01:22:48.520 --> 01:22:50.960]   Because if you come in as a white male,
[01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:52.960]   and I thought you were a black female,
[01:22:52.960 --> 01:22:53.960]   we got a problem.
[01:22:53.960 --> 01:22:55.720]   I'm not going against gender training.
[01:22:55.720 --> 01:22:57.640]   You can be whatever you want to be an American, I guess.
[01:22:57.640 --> 01:23:00.200]   But I'm just saying you can't lie to me about it.
[01:23:00.200 --> 01:23:04.000]   So any which way you put it, that was horrible advice.
[01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:05.840]   Hey, I need 5 million in funding.
[01:23:05.840 --> 01:23:07.920]   Well, how can I trust you when you trick me
[01:23:07.920 --> 01:23:09.440]   to even get this interview?
[01:23:09.440 --> 01:23:11.640]   You should have just had all the door slim in your face
[01:23:11.640 --> 01:23:12.840]   because people get turned down,
[01:23:12.840 --> 01:23:15.040]   not only for not being a woman or a color,
[01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:16.240]   but sometimes your idea just sucks
[01:23:16.240 --> 01:23:17.720]   and one person falls for where it gives you money
[01:23:17.720 --> 01:23:18.560]   when they turn down.
[01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:20.480]   I'm just saying, you can't go around lying to people
[01:23:20.480 --> 01:23:21.960]   and then ask for a job for money.
[01:23:21.960 --> 01:23:24.680]   Just crappy advice all around.
[01:23:24.680 --> 01:23:26.000]   Agreed.
[01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:26.840]   Agreed.
[01:23:26.840 --> 01:23:29.920]   - Sorry, sorry, last two thoughts on it was,
[01:23:29.920 --> 01:23:34.920]   I think the most effective thing that has helped this issue
[01:23:35.640 --> 01:23:39.480]   that the larger tech industry is coming around to
[01:23:39.480 --> 01:23:43.440]   is that the tech industry is so much more crucial
[01:23:43.440 --> 01:23:44.880]   to the future of the economy,
[01:23:44.880 --> 01:23:47.120]   to the future of human progress,
[01:23:47.120 --> 01:23:50.760]   to the future of people on this planet.
[01:23:50.760 --> 01:23:55.760]   And by and large, you have so many of the products
[01:23:55.760 --> 01:24:00.080]   that are being designed, being designed by these teams
[01:24:00.080 --> 01:24:03.760]   dominated by males and with very little diversity.
[01:24:03.760 --> 01:24:07.560]   And the problem is you can't build great products
[01:24:07.560 --> 01:24:10.280]   if you don't understand your audience, right?
[01:24:10.280 --> 01:24:13.760]   And so if you have a group that has very narrow experiences,
[01:24:13.760 --> 01:24:16.440]   they are not gonna build as effective products.
[01:24:16.440 --> 01:24:20.440]   And that argument is finally like,
[01:24:20.440 --> 01:24:22.480]   oh, now we get it, right?
[01:24:22.480 --> 01:24:24.440]   Like that makes sense to us.
[01:24:24.440 --> 01:24:27.760]   And so I do see people who have been really reluctant
[01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:31.960]   and had their feet dug in on this issue,
[01:24:31.960 --> 01:24:35.840]   softening up and finally realizing we've got a problem.
[01:24:35.840 --> 01:24:40.200]   And this is the solution to that problem.
[01:24:40.200 --> 01:24:42.680]   - Ask Snapchat how that works out for them having
[01:24:42.680 --> 01:24:45.800]   not enough people of diversity on their board
[01:24:45.800 --> 01:24:48.280]   when they make these stupid decisions
[01:24:48.280 --> 01:24:50.040]   they make every once in a blue moon.
[01:24:50.040 --> 01:24:52.480]   - Exactly, exactly.
[01:24:52.480 --> 01:24:53.800]   And the list along--
[01:24:53.800 --> 01:24:54.880]   - You mean like blackface filters?
[01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:55.720]   Yeah.
[01:24:55.720 --> 01:24:56.560]   - Yeah.
[01:24:56.560 --> 01:24:57.640]   - Asian filters?
[01:24:57.640 --> 01:24:58.480]   I mean, I--
[01:24:58.480 --> 01:24:59.560]   - All of them are terrible, yeah.
[01:24:59.560 --> 01:25:01.040]   - Yeah.
[01:25:01.040 --> 01:25:02.920]   And finally it's coming around, right?
[01:25:02.920 --> 01:25:03.920]   The--
[01:25:03.920 --> 01:25:06.240]   Some of these companies are realizing
[01:25:06.240 --> 01:25:07.400]   they are seeing Snapchat.
[01:25:07.400 --> 01:25:09.920]   They're seeing you and Apple with its emoji
[01:25:09.920 --> 01:25:12.600]   and the problems there, right?
[01:25:12.600 --> 01:25:15.640]   And they're realizing why this is a bigger problem
[01:25:15.640 --> 01:25:19.880]   and why the, you know, one, it's a responsibility problem
[01:25:19.880 --> 01:25:23.680]   if you're designing products for a global community
[01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:26.520]   and eventually it will become a financial problem
[01:25:26.520 --> 01:25:29.720]   as well if they don't figure it out
[01:25:29.720 --> 01:25:30.880]   for the companies that don't.
[01:25:30.880 --> 01:25:34.880]   'Cause some will and then those companies will be the ones
[01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:38.560]   that succeed ultimately in the future.
[01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:40.080]   I'll just stop it there, I had another thought
[01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:41.800]   but I know we need to move on to other stuff.
[01:25:41.800 --> 01:25:44.640]   - Epic rant, Twit, I love it.
[01:25:44.640 --> 01:25:47.120]   We are gonna move on, we're gonna take a quick break,
[01:25:47.120 --> 01:25:48.800]   we're gonna come back and talk about Disney
[01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:52.120]   possibly working with Twitter on a bid
[01:25:52.120 --> 01:25:55.880]   and a couple of the cool things that our folks here
[01:25:55.880 --> 01:25:57.720]   are working on and have been working on this week.
[01:25:57.720 --> 01:26:00.040]   So Leo is here to guide us through,
[01:26:00.040 --> 01:26:03.800]   we had another sponsor for This Week in Tech.
[01:26:03.800 --> 01:26:07.400]   - We'll have more with our Twit panel in just a second.
[01:26:07.400 --> 01:26:08.840]   I will be back next week by the way
[01:26:08.840 --> 01:26:12.080]   but thank you very much for filling in for me
[01:26:12.080 --> 01:26:13.400]   and doing such a great job.
[01:26:13.400 --> 01:26:16.960]   Our show today, as it has been many, many times
[01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:18.600]   before brought to you by Wealthfront,
[01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:20.520]   I am a big, big fan.
[01:26:20.520 --> 01:26:24.480]   Ironically, I'm a customer of almost everybody else
[01:26:24.480 --> 01:26:26.320]   who does ads on this channel.
[01:26:26.320 --> 01:26:28.760]   I cannot do, I cannot be a customer of Wealthfront.
[01:26:28.760 --> 01:26:32.040]   I wish I could, it's driving me nuts.
[01:26:32.040 --> 01:26:37.840]   But financial regulations, SEC regulations say
[01:26:37.840 --> 01:26:44.000]   that a customer can't do an endorsement for a product.
[01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:50.200]   This, you know, just something in the financial sector,
[01:26:50.200 --> 01:26:51.120]   I don't know why.
[01:26:51.120 --> 01:26:54.680]   So when we started doing these ads,
[01:26:54.680 --> 01:26:56.640]   well, I said, "Great, I can't wait to sign up."
[01:26:56.640 --> 01:26:59.120]   And Wealthfront said, "No, you can't."
[01:26:59.120 --> 01:27:01.920]   So Wealthfront, anytime you wanna stop, let me know.
[01:27:01.920 --> 01:27:04.360]   But meanwhile, you can do it
[01:27:04.360 --> 01:27:05.720]   and let me tell you why you wanna do it.
[01:27:05.720 --> 01:27:07.120]   Everybody should be doing, you know,
[01:27:07.120 --> 01:27:08.600]   saving for the future, right?
[01:27:08.600 --> 01:27:11.120]   Retirement, trust me.
[01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:12.600]   I didn't expect it.
[01:27:12.600 --> 01:27:14.040]   It comes, it happens.
[01:27:14.040 --> 01:27:17.680]   Rainy Day Fund, you gotta have one of those college funds
[01:27:17.680 --> 01:27:18.520]   for the kids, Mike.
[01:27:18.520 --> 01:27:21.240]   I get two kids in college, thank God I saved.
[01:27:21.240 --> 01:27:26.160]   Problem is, I was one of those smart,
[01:27:26.720 --> 01:27:29.040]   keysters, you know, one of those guys said,
[01:27:29.040 --> 01:27:30.480]   "I'll do it all myself."
[01:27:30.480 --> 01:27:32.840]   Read all the books and invested.
[01:27:32.840 --> 01:27:35.920]   And then life, you know, you get busy
[01:27:35.920 --> 01:27:39.360]   and didn't pay attention for years, decades.
[01:27:39.360 --> 01:27:42.760]   And suddenly it was like, "Well, boy, that didn't."
[01:27:42.760 --> 01:27:44.840]   Should have gotten out of that one.
[01:27:44.840 --> 01:27:47.920]   Plus, frankly, you can read all you want,
[01:27:47.920 --> 01:27:50.920]   but there is a real art to doing good investing.
[01:27:50.920 --> 01:27:51.960]   And that's why I love Wealthfront.
[01:27:51.960 --> 01:27:54.200]   Now, a professional investment advisor
[01:27:54.200 --> 01:27:55.960]   is gonna charge you one, two, or three percent
[01:27:55.960 --> 01:27:59.480]   of what you have under investment every year.
[01:27:59.480 --> 01:28:02.360]   That means you have to make that much more,
[01:28:02.360 --> 01:28:04.120]   just to break even.
[01:28:04.120 --> 01:28:06.480]   And then there's hidden transactions and stuff.
[01:28:06.480 --> 01:28:07.720]   Wealthfront does it so much better
[01:28:07.720 --> 01:28:10.480]   because Wealthfront is computerized, it's automated.
[01:28:10.480 --> 01:28:13.600]   They put all the smarts, frankly, more smarts
[01:28:13.600 --> 01:28:17.160]   than a lot of investment advisors have into the software.
[01:28:17.160 --> 01:28:18.200]   But you don't pay the same.
[01:28:18.200 --> 01:28:20.520]   You pay one quarter of one percent,
[01:28:20.520 --> 01:28:23.160]   one quarter of one percent a year.
[01:28:23.160 --> 01:28:24.920]   And there's never any additional fees,
[01:28:24.920 --> 01:28:27.200]   no transaction fees or anything.
[01:28:27.200 --> 01:28:30.720]   And unlike a human or yourself,
[01:28:30.720 --> 01:28:34.160]   they're monitoring your investments every minute.
[01:28:34.160 --> 01:28:39.160]   So even within a day, they're gonna reinvest, diversify,
[01:28:39.160 --> 01:28:41.720]   do something called tax loss harvesting,
[01:28:41.720 --> 01:28:43.280]   which I still haven't got my head around,
[01:28:43.280 --> 01:28:48.200]   but it maximizes your returns by minimizing your tax bill.
[01:28:48.200 --> 01:28:52.240]   I mean, this is smart stuff that needs to be done constantly
[01:28:52.240 --> 01:28:54.880]   and no paid advisor or you are gonna do it.
[01:28:54.880 --> 01:28:57.480]   This way, this is what's so great about computers
[01:28:57.480 --> 01:29:00.320]   and this is why Wealthfront consistently returns,
[01:29:00.320 --> 01:29:01.920]   great returns for its customers.
[01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:04.240]   I want you to check it out, Wealthfront.com,
[01:29:04.240 --> 01:29:06.200]   no need to invest, just read.
[01:29:06.200 --> 01:29:08.360]   They have a 529 college savings plan now
[01:29:08.360 --> 01:29:11.600]   if you're saving for the kids or the grandkids.
[01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:14.800]   Of course, all sorts of long-term things.
[01:29:14.800 --> 01:29:16.240]   One of the things you can do is you go there
[01:29:16.240 --> 01:29:17.840]   and answer the couple of questions
[01:29:17.840 --> 01:29:21.680]   they'll ask any new customer about timeframe,
[01:29:21.680 --> 01:29:23.080]   risk tolerance, all that stuff.
[01:29:23.080 --> 01:29:25.800]   And then they'll design a portfolio for you,
[01:29:25.800 --> 01:29:28.200]   the same one that they would invest for you,
[01:29:28.200 --> 01:29:31.240]   but you don't have to, you just take it with you, it's free.
[01:29:31.240 --> 01:29:32.760]   They thank you very much, bye-bye.
[01:29:32.760 --> 01:29:34.240]   So do that anyway.
[01:29:34.240 --> 01:29:37.160]   They'll also look at your current investments
[01:29:37.160 --> 01:29:40.440]   and see where you're losing money in fees,
[01:29:40.440 --> 01:29:42.040]   how diversified you are,
[01:29:42.040 --> 01:29:45.040]   how your tax strategies work it out, things like that.
[01:29:45.040 --> 01:29:47.520]   So it's a lot of information there for free.
[01:29:47.520 --> 01:29:51.160]   Wealthfront.com/twit, if you decide to invest,
[01:29:51.160 --> 01:29:52.960]   and believe me, I would be if I could,
[01:29:52.960 --> 01:29:55.160]   it starts with $500, but here's the deal.
[01:29:55.160 --> 01:29:57.800]   I would put in, and you don't have to do it right away,
[01:29:57.800 --> 01:30:01.840]   but over time, $15,000, 'cause that is fee-free.
[01:30:01.840 --> 01:30:05.320]   The first $15,000, free forever,
[01:30:05.320 --> 01:30:08.360]   not for a year or two or whatever, just free forever.
[01:30:08.360 --> 01:30:10.280]   So now you're real, that's a great way
[01:30:10.280 --> 01:30:12.760]   to kind of kickstart your nest egg.
[01:30:12.760 --> 01:30:13.600]   I love these guys.
[01:30:13.600 --> 01:30:17.960]   Wealthfront.com/twit, I can invest, but you can.
[01:30:17.960 --> 01:30:22.280]   So please do, wealthfront.com/twit.
[01:30:22.280 --> 01:30:25.640]   We thank you so much for this support of This Week in Tech.
[01:30:25.640 --> 01:30:26.960]   Now back to the show.
[01:30:26.960 --> 01:30:31.920]   - Leo Laport on a boat somewhere off the Danish coast,
[01:30:31.920 --> 01:30:36.280]   but Becky Worley here, manning the Twit table.
[01:30:36.280 --> 01:30:37.760]   We have an amazing panel in, guys.
[01:30:37.760 --> 01:30:41.080]   I don't know, I didn't realize that Leo's table,
[01:30:41.080 --> 01:30:44.960]   watch this, it goes up and down at the push of a button.
[01:30:44.960 --> 01:30:45.880]   - Please. - Did you guys know that?
[01:30:45.880 --> 01:30:47.040]   - Wow. - Look at that,
[01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:47.880]   can you hear it?
[01:30:47.880 --> 01:30:50.080]   It's going, like right now it's right around my armpits
[01:30:50.080 --> 01:30:51.040]   and then I can bring it down.
[01:30:51.040 --> 01:30:53.080]   Oh, there it's going all the way up.
[01:30:53.080 --> 01:30:54.400]   Is that cool or what?
[01:30:54.400 --> 01:30:55.560]   - That's so cool.
[01:30:55.560 --> 01:30:58.760]   - Does it stop becoming a standing table?
[01:30:58.760 --> 01:31:01.040]   - You know, I don't think it goes all the way to standing,
[01:31:01.040 --> 01:31:02.920]   but knowing Leo, I think he'll have that
[01:31:02.920 --> 01:31:04.860]   on the agenda coming up.
[01:31:04.860 --> 01:31:10.840]   I wanted to dig into this story about Twitter.
[01:31:10.840 --> 01:31:13.840]   We've gotten the news, it's been very clear
[01:31:13.840 --> 01:31:16.560]   in the last few weeks that Twitter is for sale.
[01:31:16.560 --> 01:31:18.120]   Somebody, they were looking for somewhere to come in
[01:31:18.120 --> 01:31:19.320]   and save the day.
[01:31:19.320 --> 01:31:22.480]   And this week, the big news is that,
[01:31:22.480 --> 01:31:25.040]   Walt Disney Company, working with a financial advisor
[01:31:25.040 --> 01:31:28.360]   to evaluate a possible bid for Twitter,
[01:31:28.360 --> 01:31:30.840]   Salesforce, also considering it,
[01:31:30.840 --> 01:31:35.520]   possibly it's been bandied about some of the phone companies.
[01:31:35.520 --> 01:31:38.160]   I'm a Disney employee, I don't speak for them,
[01:31:38.160 --> 01:31:39.840]   I don't know anything about this,
[01:31:39.840 --> 01:31:45.160]   but I gotta say, I kind of think the Disney thing makes sense.
[01:31:45.160 --> 01:31:47.280]   Does it make sense to any of you?
[01:31:47.280 --> 01:31:48.200]   - No, it's pretty good. - Yeah.
[01:31:48.200 --> 01:31:50.120]   - It's gonna be Google, it's gonna be Google.
[01:31:50.120 --> 01:31:52.320]   It was always gonna be Google, it's gonna be Google.
[01:31:52.320 --> 01:31:53.520]   It's just a matter of when.
[01:31:53.520 --> 01:31:56.800]   Google's waiting until it gets enough to do it.
[01:31:56.800 --> 01:31:59.160]   - I mean, that's probably been my gut feeling too.
[01:31:59.160 --> 01:32:00.880]   Jason and I have also thought that the Google
[01:32:00.880 --> 01:32:03.200]   makes the most sense from a data standpoint
[01:32:03.200 --> 01:32:07.400]   and the fact that Google has no play in social
[01:32:07.400 --> 01:32:08.920]   and this would at least get some of that.
[01:32:08.920 --> 01:32:12.000]   I think that they already have the partnership
[01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:12.840]   with the search results.
[01:32:12.840 --> 01:32:14.160]   I think that from a data play,
[01:32:14.160 --> 01:32:15.160]   it would make sense for Google.
[01:32:15.160 --> 01:32:17.920]   But I don't think it'll ultimately be Disney,
[01:32:17.920 --> 01:32:20.560]   but I understand why Disney as a media company
[01:32:20.560 --> 01:32:21.920]   would be looking into this.
[01:32:21.920 --> 01:32:26.080]   And I understand why they would be kicking the tires
[01:32:26.080 --> 01:32:27.200]   and I think a lot of people think Disney
[01:32:27.200 --> 01:32:28.320]   and they think, you know, movie studio,
[01:32:28.320 --> 01:32:30.240]   they think, you know, theme park company,
[01:32:30.240 --> 01:32:31.840]   they don't think, you know, the same company
[01:32:31.840 --> 01:32:33.240]   that, you know, Botmaker Studios
[01:32:33.240 --> 01:32:34.520]   and has made a lot of other investments
[01:32:34.520 --> 01:32:36.560]   and that it is a really, really big media player.
[01:32:36.560 --> 01:32:37.560]   - Yes, yeah.
[01:32:37.560 --> 01:32:41.440]   I mean, is there any more of a second screen component
[01:32:41.440 --> 01:32:42.520]   than for sports?
[01:32:42.520 --> 01:32:43.360]   - Oh, really?
[01:32:43.360 --> 01:32:44.200]   No, you're dead on.
[01:32:44.200 --> 01:32:45.040]   I mean, I think that you just, you know,
[01:32:45.040 --> 01:32:47.240]   alone would be a huge part of it
[01:32:47.240 --> 01:32:49.440]   and they've already done, you know, partnerships with the SPN
[01:32:49.440 --> 01:32:51.240]   and they've done partnerships with ABC too, you know,
[01:32:51.240 --> 01:32:53.320]   there've been a lot of partnerships on that side,
[01:32:53.320 --> 01:32:55.920]   but I think just from a media entity standpoint,
[01:32:55.920 --> 01:33:00.040]   I could understand why they would at least be interested
[01:33:00.040 --> 01:33:01.080]   in looking at it.
[01:33:01.080 --> 01:33:03.920]   I do, I guess, where my question would be
[01:33:03.920 --> 01:33:05.840]   and this is why, this is not what I'm in.
[01:33:05.840 --> 01:33:07.160]   I'm a journalist, I'm not an M&A,
[01:33:07.160 --> 01:33:09.320]   but I would be wondering like, why,
[01:33:09.320 --> 01:33:11.800]   whether it would be worth, you know, spending, you know,
[01:33:11.800 --> 01:33:14.840]   potentially, you know, like 10 or 11 billion dollars
[01:33:14.840 --> 01:33:16.840]   to make that sort of acquisition.
[01:33:16.840 --> 01:33:18.600]   - I have one theory on that, which, you know,
[01:33:18.600 --> 01:33:20.720]   a lot of people just said, this doesn't make any sense,
[01:33:20.720 --> 01:33:21.560]   why would they do that?
[01:33:21.560 --> 01:33:23.680]   And I can see some economies of scale
[01:33:23.680 --> 01:33:28.680]   because I think you could use the pre-existing ad sales folks
[01:33:28.680 --> 01:33:31.640]   at a big, huge conglomerate like Disney
[01:33:31.640 --> 01:33:36.280]   with economies of scale to sell and monetize advertisement
[01:33:36.280 --> 01:33:37.840]   on Twitter in a different way.
[01:33:37.840 --> 01:33:38.960]   I'm not advocating for that.
[01:33:38.960 --> 01:33:40.800]   I'm just saying, I can see where that makes sense
[01:33:40.800 --> 01:33:42.840]   'cause you've already got that in play.
[01:33:42.840 --> 01:33:44.160]   - I mean, I mean, yeah, I mean, I guess--
[01:33:44.160 --> 01:33:45.840]   - It's just not a good new business though.
[01:33:45.840 --> 01:33:47.320]   - I guess, yeah, I guess my question would be,
[01:33:47.320 --> 01:33:48.680]   no, I guess my question would be on that.
[01:33:48.680 --> 01:33:49.520]   I mean, I agree with you,
[01:33:49.520 --> 01:33:51.720]   there would be definitely some some ad components there,
[01:33:51.720 --> 01:33:53.440]   but you're talking about 300 million users.
[01:33:53.440 --> 01:33:54.720]   Is that enough where you're ever going
[01:33:54.720 --> 01:33:56.240]   to get your return on investments
[01:33:56.240 --> 01:33:58.800]   for making that sort of overlay if you're Disney, you know?
[01:33:58.800 --> 01:34:00.280]   - But does it future-proof you?
[01:34:00.280 --> 01:34:01.640]   I mean, I think that's what every company
[01:34:01.640 --> 01:34:03.680]   who's looking at Twitter except for Google
[01:34:03.680 --> 01:34:06.760]   is looking for some sort of future-proofing.
[01:34:06.760 --> 01:34:09.360]   - The future of that business is a data business though.
[01:34:09.360 --> 01:34:10.720]   Like, that's why Google makes sense.
[01:34:10.720 --> 01:34:12.400]   It makes sense for nobody else.
[01:34:12.400 --> 01:34:15.520]   The advertising business is not good enough.
[01:34:15.520 --> 01:34:17.080]   You know, they're numbers.
[01:34:17.080 --> 01:34:17.920]   You look at their numbers.
[01:34:17.920 --> 01:34:20.040]   I know we're not a financial show,
[01:34:20.040 --> 01:34:21.720]   but you know, if you look at their numbers,
[01:34:21.720 --> 01:34:22.960]   their numbers are not good enough.
[01:34:22.960 --> 01:34:24.640]   They're never going to be good enough
[01:34:24.640 --> 01:34:27.080]   because they don't know enough about their users.
[01:34:27.080 --> 01:34:29.840]   And so that's why Facebook just eats their lunch
[01:34:29.840 --> 01:34:32.840]   in that sort of social advertising space.
[01:34:32.840 --> 01:34:34.800]   Facebook also their self-serve business.
[01:34:34.800 --> 01:34:36.080]   Facebook has turned it in,
[01:34:36.080 --> 01:34:38.080]   has greased the wheels on that.
[01:34:38.080 --> 01:34:40.320]   And it's just crushing them in that.
[01:34:40.320 --> 01:34:42.920]   You know, their advertising business is not good enough.
[01:34:42.920 --> 01:34:45.360]   Their data business, the future of that business
[01:34:45.360 --> 01:34:46.440]   is a data business.
[01:34:46.440 --> 01:34:50.400]   It is such a goldmine of real-time data.
[01:34:50.400 --> 01:34:54.120]   And somebody, they haven't figured it out themselves.
[01:34:54.120 --> 01:34:56.200]   They need a partner to figure it out themselves.
[01:34:56.200 --> 01:34:59.920]   That's why Salesforce makes weirdly might make sense
[01:34:59.920 --> 01:35:02.320]   because Salesforce, the only reason Salesforce
[01:35:02.320 --> 01:35:04.800]   is interested is Salesforce knows the future
[01:35:04.800 --> 01:35:05.920]   is a data business.
[01:35:05.920 --> 01:35:06.920]   Yeah. - Salesforce has
[01:35:06.920 --> 01:35:08.240]   not the money to do it, but you're right.
[01:35:08.240 --> 01:35:12.200]   I mean, Salesforce would have to get, you know,
[01:35:12.200 --> 01:35:14.080]   a huge amount of other capital.
[01:35:14.080 --> 01:35:16.600]   They'd have to, you know, do some sort of,
[01:35:16.600 --> 01:35:17.680]   either do an all-stock deal,
[01:35:17.680 --> 01:35:19.680]   which the investors at Twitter would never approve,
[01:35:19.680 --> 01:35:21.280]   or they'd have to, you know, basically work
[01:35:21.280 --> 01:35:22.920]   with somebody else to make a big bid.
[01:35:22.920 --> 01:35:25.120]   But I mean, Disney definitely has the money.
[01:35:25.120 --> 01:35:26.560]   Google definitely has the money.
[01:35:26.560 --> 01:35:28.760]   I don't know, it's interesting because I think that,
[01:35:28.760 --> 01:35:32.480]   but don't you think, Jason, and all of you guys, I guess,
[01:35:32.480 --> 01:35:33.800]   doesn't this speak to kind of, I guess,
[01:35:33.800 --> 01:35:35.680]   one of Twitter's core problems, which is,
[01:35:35.680 --> 01:35:37.680]   on the one hand, it is kind of this, you know,
[01:35:37.680 --> 01:35:40.120]   data service, it is kind of this social service.
[01:35:40.120 --> 01:35:42.680]   It is data, which is why Google will be interested.
[01:35:42.680 --> 01:35:44.200]   But fundamentally, the way we interact with it,
[01:35:44.200 --> 01:35:45.600]   and the way that it's portrayed all of us,
[01:35:45.600 --> 01:35:47.240]   is it is a media entity.
[01:35:47.240 --> 01:35:50.360]   And I think that's probably why the company has struggled
[01:35:50.360 --> 01:35:52.240]   as a public company to make money,
[01:35:52.240 --> 01:35:53.800]   and to really even gain traction,
[01:35:53.800 --> 01:35:55.520]   because they sell these two different parts.
[01:35:55.520 --> 01:35:57.360]   They sell the messages these two different parts.
[01:35:57.360 --> 01:35:59.520]   Oh, we're just a fire hose, but at the same time,
[01:35:59.520 --> 01:36:02.960]   we're also, you know, a media entity into ourselves.
[01:36:02.960 --> 01:36:03.960]   - Well, a couple of things.
[01:36:03.960 --> 01:36:05.920]   One, why hasn't Google bought them already?
[01:36:05.920 --> 01:36:07.280]   Maybe the price isn't right.
[01:36:07.280 --> 01:36:08.640]   - Price, and totally.
[01:36:08.640 --> 01:36:11.960]   - And number two, the issue with Twitter is it's become
[01:36:11.960 --> 01:36:14.560]   the zeitgeist of our society.
[01:36:14.560 --> 01:36:15.400]   - Sure.
[01:36:15.400 --> 01:36:20.320]   - When you watch any TV show or news program,
[01:36:20.320 --> 01:36:22.680]   they're gonna say, well, this just blew up
[01:36:22.680 --> 01:36:23.680]   on Twitter overnight.
[01:36:23.680 --> 01:36:26.240]   They might say it blew up on social media,
[01:36:26.240 --> 01:36:28.120]   but because Facebook is segmented
[01:36:28.120 --> 01:36:30.160]   just to the people that you know,
[01:36:30.160 --> 01:36:33.080]   your experience may be very different from someone else's
[01:36:33.080 --> 01:36:35.320]   depending on how your friends skew,
[01:36:35.320 --> 01:36:37.800]   but Twitter is ubiquitous and open to everyone.
[01:36:37.800 --> 01:36:41.640]   And so it has become this pulse that's taken.
[01:36:41.640 --> 01:36:44.400]   And I feel like that has a value in the news world.
[01:36:44.400 --> 01:36:45.760]   - Can I jump in here?
[01:36:45.760 --> 01:36:46.600]   - Yeah.
[01:36:46.600 --> 01:36:47.440]   - Sorry, go ahead.
[01:36:47.440 --> 01:36:49.400]   - I want the football fan to weigh in.
[01:36:49.400 --> 01:36:54.360]   - So first of all, Google is evil and they destroy social.
[01:36:54.360 --> 01:36:56.160]   I'm not going to get into deep about that.
[01:36:56.160 --> 01:36:58.440]   They got the pockets, but they don't have fortitude
[01:36:58.440 --> 01:37:00.000]   unless they're just gonna let somebody else run it,
[01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:01.320]   which obviously you can't really do that
[01:37:01.320 --> 01:37:03.200]   because Twitter doesn't run itself very well.
[01:37:03.200 --> 01:37:05.240]   Then we got Disney, I think Disney's also evil
[01:37:05.240 --> 01:37:07.320]   because then they gotta play with all these other corporations
[01:37:07.320 --> 01:37:09.080]   and they're not super nice when it comes to that.
[01:37:09.080 --> 01:37:10.240]   And they're gonna send some stuff.
[01:37:10.240 --> 01:37:11.080]   They're not for nothing.
[01:37:11.080 --> 01:37:13.520]   I like being able to see whatever I want to see on Twitter.
[01:37:13.520 --> 01:37:15.080]   I'm not saying I'll be on Twitter after dark.
[01:37:15.080 --> 01:37:17.160]   I'm just saying it's available for those who want to see it.
[01:37:17.160 --> 01:37:18.920]   So I don't really want the Disney parent company
[01:37:18.920 --> 01:37:21.280]   cook as a cream to come and take that over.
[01:37:21.280 --> 01:37:23.360]   Salesforce seems like the best option to me
[01:37:23.360 --> 01:37:24.400]   even though they ain't got the money,
[01:37:24.400 --> 01:37:26.440]   but maybe they paired it with Amazon,
[01:37:26.440 --> 01:37:28.240]   get some of that back fun and put it up in the cloud,
[01:37:28.240 --> 01:37:29.280]   get that free hosting.
[01:37:29.280 --> 01:37:30.480]   Maybe that would be a great deal.
[01:37:30.480 --> 01:37:33.720]   I don't know, I'm just saying, I don't want ESPN,
[01:37:33.720 --> 01:37:35.040]   or that stuff has already got the deals.
[01:37:35.040 --> 01:37:37.200]   That's cool, but I don't need Disney getting involved
[01:37:37.200 --> 01:37:38.880]   and watering down my Twitter.
[01:37:38.880 --> 01:37:41.000]   And I don't need Google getting involved
[01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.280]   and Google lies in it and kind of like they do.
[01:37:43.280 --> 01:37:45.840]   Because we need Twitter, Twitter is the essence of life.
[01:37:45.840 --> 01:37:47.480]   - Yeah, the Twitter's gonna get sold.
[01:37:47.480 --> 01:37:48.320]   Somebody's gonna buy it.
[01:37:48.320 --> 01:37:49.560]   - Oh, somebody's gonna buy it.
[01:37:49.560 --> 01:37:51.320]   I'm just giving my opinion on who shouldn't shoot
[01:37:51.320 --> 01:37:52.480]   and buy it, I don't like it.
[01:37:52.480 --> 01:37:53.320]   I'm just saying.
[01:37:53.320 --> 01:37:54.160]   - Can you agree with this?
[01:37:54.160 --> 01:37:55.000]   Oh, can you agree with this?
[01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:58.400]   I would much rather Disney buy Twitter than Tencent, okay?
[01:37:58.400 --> 01:38:01.240]   If I'm being real, I don't want a Chinese media conglomerate,
[01:38:01.240 --> 01:38:03.000]   Chinese media group, 'cause that's who else is gonna be it.
[01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:06.840]   It's gonna be Saudis or Chinese or Chinese or something like that.
[01:38:06.840 --> 01:38:08.440]   That's who's gonna buy it if it's not Disney
[01:38:08.440 --> 01:38:12.680]   or Google or some other big US media conglomerate.
[01:38:12.680 --> 01:38:13.680]   That's what it's gonna be.
[01:38:13.680 --> 01:38:15.120]   And if you wanna talk about censorship,
[01:38:15.120 --> 01:38:17.360]   if Tencent buys it, it's gonna be way worse.
[01:38:17.360 --> 01:38:19.160]   - Tencent is a real possibility too.
[01:38:19.160 --> 01:38:24.160]   That they're going crazy over there and they're printing money
[01:38:24.160 --> 01:38:26.160]   and they know how to make,
[01:38:26.160 --> 01:38:27.520]   to turn these things into business.
[01:38:27.520 --> 01:38:29.080]   They put so much into it.
[01:38:29.080 --> 01:38:31.800]   But I do think, to your point Becky,
[01:38:31.800 --> 01:38:34.280]   Twitter is the real time internet.
[01:38:34.280 --> 01:38:36.200]   It has cultural value.
[01:38:36.200 --> 01:38:39.040]   It has so much future value.
[01:38:39.040 --> 01:38:44.040]   It is the pulse of the world and that real time data.
[01:38:44.040 --> 01:38:46.280]   It is seen on a data set
[01:38:46.280 --> 01:38:48.360]   that has never existed in human history, right?
[01:38:48.360 --> 01:38:51.840]   What are people saying, thinking, doing, believing
[01:38:51.840 --> 01:38:54.280]   about what's happening in the world right now
[01:38:54.280 --> 01:38:56.800]   that has tremendous value to markets?
[01:38:56.800 --> 01:38:59.760]   It has tremendous value, that data.
[01:38:59.760 --> 01:39:03.040]   The value of that data, I wish Twitter
[01:39:03.040 --> 01:39:04.760]   had figured this out themselves
[01:39:04.760 --> 01:39:06.760]   because if they had, and I've written about this,
[01:39:06.760 --> 01:39:08.880]   I've written at least three editorials about this
[01:39:08.880 --> 01:39:11.720]   in the last three or five years,
[01:39:11.720 --> 01:39:13.440]   that it is a data business.
[01:39:13.440 --> 01:39:16.480]   If they had figured that out, they would have reopened
[01:39:16.480 --> 01:39:19.520]   the API and they wouldn't have tried to control it
[01:39:19.520 --> 01:39:21.480]   and turn it into an advertising business.
[01:39:21.480 --> 01:39:23.120]   It's a war they can't win.
[01:39:23.120 --> 01:39:25.440]   They already lost that to Facebook.
[01:39:25.440 --> 01:39:28.480]   If they had done that, they could have been bigger
[01:39:28.480 --> 01:39:29.320]   than Facebook.
[01:39:29.320 --> 01:39:32.080]   They could have been Google.
[01:39:32.080 --> 01:39:33.240]   I feel like in many cases.
[01:39:33.240 --> 01:39:35.040]   I don't think they ever could have been bigger than Facebook.
[01:39:35.040 --> 01:39:36.720]   I don't think they ever could have been bigger than Facebook.
[01:39:36.720 --> 01:39:37.880]   Because I think that the--
[01:39:37.880 --> 01:39:39.040]   Why can't he not buy?
[01:39:39.040 --> 01:39:40.120]   And I also think that--
[01:39:40.120 --> 01:39:42.400]   Stop displaying what drones for like a week
[01:39:42.400 --> 01:39:44.400]   and just take thousands of weeks' worth of money
[01:39:44.400 --> 01:39:45.240]   and just buy it.
[01:39:45.240 --> 01:39:46.080]   He doesn't need it.
[01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:46.920]   He doesn't need it.
[01:39:46.920 --> 01:39:47.760]   He doesn't need it.
[01:39:47.760 --> 01:39:48.600]   He doesn't need to have stuff they buy.
[01:39:48.600 --> 01:39:49.600]   He doesn't need that stuff.
[01:39:49.600 --> 01:39:51.120]   But he gets absolutely nothing from it.
[01:39:51.120 --> 01:39:52.640]   Like he genuinely gets nothing from it.
[01:39:52.640 --> 01:39:54.360]   Everybody who's on Twitter is on Facebook.
[01:39:54.360 --> 01:39:55.880]   He gets absolutely nothing from it.
[01:39:55.880 --> 01:39:57.840]   And he's making--
[01:39:57.840 --> 01:40:00.040]   And it dilutes his ad business
[01:40:00.040 --> 01:40:02.760]   because now he's trying to sell an ad product to people
[01:40:02.760 --> 01:40:04.040]   where he has certain CPMs for Twitter
[01:40:04.040 --> 01:40:05.640]   and certain CPMs for Facebook.
[01:40:05.640 --> 01:40:07.040]   There's no way that would make any sense.
[01:40:07.040 --> 01:40:09.240]   But I agree with you, Jason.
[01:40:09.240 --> 01:40:12.280]   I think that this points to a lot of strategic missteps
[01:40:12.280 --> 01:40:15.000]   that the company made when they started to close themselves
[01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:19.480]   off from being the pipe and to trying to do this other stuff.
[01:40:19.480 --> 01:40:23.240]   But it makes me sad, though, because I love Twitter.
[01:40:23.240 --> 01:40:25.640]   And I know that they're not everybody uses it.
[01:40:25.640 --> 01:40:26.920]   And that's part of the problem, too.
[01:40:26.920 --> 01:40:28.440]   It's only 300 million users.
[01:40:28.440 --> 01:40:30.800]   But it has become much more outsized, I think,
[01:40:30.800 --> 01:40:33.080]   other than its user base in terms of its impact on culture
[01:40:33.080 --> 01:40:34.080]   and on news.
[01:40:34.080 --> 01:40:37.200]   And that, I think, is why you have media companies interested
[01:40:37.200 --> 01:40:38.800]   and media conglomerates interested in it
[01:40:38.800 --> 01:40:40.080]   and looking at spending that money,
[01:40:40.080 --> 01:40:45.000]   because if nothing else, they want to preserve that as a source
[01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:49.160]   to get information out and also seeing the data potential,
[01:40:49.160 --> 01:40:51.680]   potentially capture what people are doing.
[01:40:51.680 --> 01:40:53.680]   I hate when we have to talk about Twitter like it's dead
[01:40:53.680 --> 01:40:56.640]   or not to die sometime tomorrow.
[01:40:56.640 --> 01:40:59.320]   Twitter is like a STD with no cure.
[01:40:59.320 --> 01:41:00.840]   It's just going to be around.
[01:41:00.840 --> 01:41:03.600]   You might forget that you have it, but everybody knows you got it.
[01:41:03.600 --> 01:41:05.040]   Like, Twitter is there.
[01:41:05.040 --> 01:41:06.120]   It's not going anywhere.
[01:41:06.120 --> 01:41:07.120]   People are Twitter.
[01:41:07.120 --> 01:41:09.120]   Don't you tell me to put on me?
[01:41:09.120 --> 01:41:11.960]   There is no prophylactic against Twitter.
[01:41:11.960 --> 01:41:14.320]   I hear you.
[01:41:14.320 --> 01:41:17.400]   I'm going to take this conversation because I love it.
[01:41:17.400 --> 01:41:19.480]   And I know that we all could go off on Twitter
[01:41:19.480 --> 01:41:21.040]   and all of its possibilities.
[01:41:21.040 --> 01:41:22.920]   I'm going to take it and redirect us
[01:41:22.920 --> 01:41:26.200]   to a couple of the headlines that hit later in the week.
[01:41:26.200 --> 01:41:31.200]   This one, "The United States no longer controls the internet."
[01:41:31.200 --> 01:41:36.040]   That was the exact headline to convey the idea
[01:41:36.040 --> 01:41:38.920]   of the DNS handoff Department of Commerce,
[01:41:38.920 --> 01:41:41.720]   giving control to the internet corporation
[01:41:41.720 --> 01:41:43.680]   for assigned names and numbers,
[01:41:43.680 --> 01:41:48.600]   so that all of your naming issues will now no longer be
[01:41:48.600 --> 01:41:51.960]   a US government sanctioned event.
[01:41:51.960 --> 01:41:53.040]   Is this a big deal, you guys?
[01:41:53.040 --> 01:41:54.360]   Do we care?
[01:41:54.360 --> 01:41:56.000]   Yeah, I think it's time.
[01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:59.040]   Usually, sorry, I'm usually such a positive person.
[01:41:59.040 --> 01:42:03.360]   I feel like I'm going to be Mr. Negative on this whole episode.
[01:42:03.360 --> 01:42:06.400]   The sun has set on your setting, so go ahead and feel
[01:42:06.400 --> 01:42:08.960]   that Dr. Evil now.
[01:42:08.960 --> 01:42:14.160]   So, in principle, like this has been in practice
[01:42:14.160 --> 01:42:17.760]   for or in process, I should say, for a long time,
[01:42:17.760 --> 01:42:19.360]   in the ICANN thing.
[01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:21.800]   And in principle, absolutely.
[01:42:21.800 --> 01:42:23.720]   The internet is an international thing.
[01:42:23.720 --> 01:42:30.720]   It should have international organization running it.
[01:42:30.720 --> 01:42:33.320]   But here's the problem with that.
[01:42:33.320 --> 01:42:35.880]   Is the internet, fundamentally, the most important thing
[01:42:35.880 --> 01:42:38.160]   about the internet is that it remains open.
[01:42:38.160 --> 01:42:40.040]   And we all agree on that.
[01:42:40.040 --> 01:42:42.000]   Well, at least all of us here.
[01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:48.040]   And so, my concern with what we're doing
[01:42:48.040 --> 01:42:52.000]   is that if it goes to an international body,
[01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:56.800]   where all of these players, essentially,
[01:42:56.800 --> 01:43:01.240]   these international bodies, they try to make compromises
[01:43:01.240 --> 01:43:03.920]   to everybody involved, because there's
[01:43:03.920 --> 01:43:06.000]   a lot of people with different values who
[01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:07.880]   are trying to have buy-in.
[01:43:07.880 --> 01:43:10.160]   As long as the ICANN was in the United States,
[01:43:10.160 --> 01:43:12.640]   the US sort of had-- there were certain things
[01:43:12.640 --> 01:43:14.160]   that it was going to defend.
[01:43:14.160 --> 01:43:16.080]   It was always going to be open.
[01:43:16.080 --> 01:43:17.880]   That's not a question.
[01:43:17.880 --> 01:43:23.160]   And the US, I feel, is the best defender of that.
[01:43:23.160 --> 01:43:26.840]   For all of its other faults in the United States
[01:43:26.840 --> 01:43:29.280]   and the other challenges we're dealing with right now,
[01:43:29.280 --> 01:43:31.600]   there's that.
[01:43:31.600 --> 01:43:32.120]   My concern--
[01:43:32.120 --> 01:43:33.520]   And just to interject there, Jason,
[01:43:33.520 --> 01:43:34.720]   I mean, you're not alone.
[01:43:34.720 --> 01:43:38.400]   There was a last minute bid here to keep the control in the US,
[01:43:38.400 --> 01:43:40.920]   led by Ted Cruz, amongst others.
[01:43:40.920 --> 01:43:44.520]   And his quote was, "Imagine an internet run
[01:43:44.520 --> 01:43:46.880]   like many Middle Eastern countries
[01:43:46.880 --> 01:43:50.080]   that punish what they deem to be blasphemy.
[01:43:50.080 --> 01:43:53.520]   Imagine an internet, he went on to say, run like China or Russia
[01:43:53.520 --> 01:43:56.360]   that punish or incarcerate those who engage in political dissent.
[01:43:56.360 --> 01:43:58.080]   Is that your worst case scenario here?
[01:43:58.080 --> 01:43:59.200]   And we're talking about--
[01:43:59.200 --> 01:44:01.160]   And just to back out of this for a quick second,
[01:44:01.160 --> 01:44:03.120]   we're talking about the organization that
[01:44:03.120 --> 01:44:06.440]   takes a name like twit.tv or what have you
[01:44:06.440 --> 01:44:08.880]   and assigns it the numbers that then get it to the computer
[01:44:08.880 --> 01:44:10.120]   that serves up the website.
[01:44:10.120 --> 01:44:13.400]   So there is a potential where if someone really didn't
[01:44:13.400 --> 01:44:16.520]   like what a website was doing, it could redirect that.
[01:44:16.520 --> 01:44:18.320]   Is that your worst case scenario?
[01:44:18.320 --> 01:44:19.800]   Yeah, Ted Cruz is a maniac.
[01:44:19.800 --> 01:44:23.800]   So I'm sorry to agree with Ted Cruz on this.
[01:44:23.800 --> 01:44:27.520]   But there is actually some truth to the fact of you look
[01:44:27.520 --> 01:44:31.680]   at what they're doing in places like Turkey and in China
[01:44:31.680 --> 01:44:38.400]   and in Egypt where they feel like to control uprisings,
[01:44:38.400 --> 01:44:42.760]   to control their populations, they
[01:44:42.760 --> 01:44:44.480]   feel like they have the right to control
[01:44:44.480 --> 01:44:47.120]   the internet in their country.
[01:44:47.120 --> 01:44:50.840]   And so far, in the history of the internet,
[01:44:50.840 --> 01:44:55.120]   that has not been allowed or to the best of what we can control.
[01:44:55.120 --> 01:44:56.360]   It hasn't.
[01:44:56.360 --> 01:44:58.200]   But where it's an international body,
[01:44:58.200 --> 01:45:04.040]   I just worry who's going to stand up and say, no, open.
[01:45:04.040 --> 01:45:08.960]   If all of a sudden it's made up by a lot of competing interests,
[01:45:08.960 --> 01:45:12.520]   in principle, it should be run by an international body.
[01:45:12.520 --> 01:45:16.000]   I just don't know if in the world that we live in today,
[01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:19.320]   people are going to stand up and stand up for the openness
[01:45:19.320 --> 01:45:21.760]   of the internet to the same extent that US does.
[01:45:21.760 --> 01:45:22.600]   That's all.
[01:45:22.600 --> 01:45:24.080]   You brought up Ted Cruz.
[01:45:24.080 --> 01:45:26.920]   I just had to be devil's advocate and just say to you
[01:45:26.920 --> 01:45:29.080]   that there's a thing that Ted Cruz may have never heard of.
[01:45:29.080 --> 01:45:30.600]   But it's called the United Nations.
[01:45:30.600 --> 01:45:32.920]   It's where a whole bunch of people that run a whole bunch
[01:45:32.920 --> 01:45:35.640]   of other places come together, sit down in the room
[01:45:35.640 --> 01:45:37.440]   and get to the gap with translate machines
[01:45:37.440 --> 01:45:39.720]   and come to decide on how things should be.
[01:45:39.720 --> 01:45:41.440]   I don't like that America is a bully.
[01:45:41.440 --> 01:45:42.960]   I don't like that America goes around the world
[01:45:42.960 --> 01:45:44.120]   telling other people what they can't do
[01:45:44.120 --> 01:45:46.520]   because I don't really like, I've been to China, love China.
[01:45:46.520 --> 01:45:48.200]   I understand why China does what they can't do.
[01:45:48.200 --> 01:45:49.760]   But who are we to tell them what they can't do
[01:45:49.760 --> 01:45:51.480]   and they don't have a voice or an opinion
[01:45:51.480 --> 01:45:52.520]   to come down to the table?
[01:45:52.520 --> 01:45:53.520]   It's not really fair.
[01:45:53.520 --> 01:45:54.520]   It's not really nice.
[01:45:54.520 --> 01:45:55.600]   I don't understand why we do it.
[01:45:55.600 --> 01:45:56.680]   America just gets away with it.
[01:45:56.680 --> 01:45:58.040]   I'm just saying it's not cool.
[01:45:58.040 --> 01:46:00.200]   And the UN can sit down and have some conversations
[01:46:00.200 --> 01:46:01.520]   to come to certain agreements.
[01:46:01.520 --> 01:46:03.800]   And so I think it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world.
[01:46:03.800 --> 01:46:05.800]   Ted Cruz saying what he's saying,
[01:46:05.800 --> 01:46:07.120]   it's not going to go with that diabolical.
[01:46:07.120 --> 01:46:08.640]   He's saying it like they're just going to come in
[01:46:08.640 --> 01:46:10.040]   and just change the world.
[01:46:10.040 --> 01:46:11.520]   If there's an international body,
[01:46:11.520 --> 01:46:13.240]   then they have to make these discussions
[01:46:13.240 --> 01:46:15.000]   and come to decisions together.
[01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:16.160]   That's how that would work.
[01:46:16.160 --> 01:46:18.080]   It's not just like, you just,
[01:46:18.080 --> 01:46:20.560]   I assume that's what they meant, Mike.
[01:46:20.560 --> 01:46:21.560]   And then an international group.
[01:46:21.560 --> 01:46:23.000]   - No, I mean, that's the interesting thing
[01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.520]   is how the ICANN group is determined.
[01:46:25.520 --> 01:46:28.480]   I mean, it's government representatives,
[01:46:28.480 --> 01:46:32.040]   it's business representatives, it's tech experts.
[01:46:32.040 --> 01:46:35.600]   And just to represent what the chat room was saying
[01:46:35.600 --> 01:46:39.200]   is in support of that was what you were mentioning, Jason,
[01:46:39.200 --> 01:46:41.320]   was during the Arab Spring
[01:46:41.320 --> 01:46:44.080]   and Egypt pulling the plug on their internet completely,
[01:46:44.080 --> 01:46:45.280]   it's not unprecedented.
[01:46:45.280 --> 01:46:48.760]   The question is how much diversity is on that group
[01:46:48.760 --> 01:46:50.720]   that can hold its own independently
[01:46:50.720 --> 01:46:53.560]   without the weight of a big superpower.
[01:46:53.560 --> 01:46:58.000]   And I think to be decided,
[01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:01.080]   but hopefully not an issue in the near future.
[01:47:01.080 --> 01:47:02.800]   I'm going to stop us for a second.
[01:47:02.800 --> 01:47:04.480]   Couple cool things coming up.
[01:47:04.480 --> 01:47:07.160]   Big problems with the iPhone 7
[01:47:07.160 --> 01:47:09.960]   or maybe little big problems with the low two,
[01:47:09.960 --> 01:47:11.400]   little big problems.
[01:47:11.400 --> 01:47:15.720]   And a little bit about some security issues.
[01:47:15.720 --> 01:47:18.680]   I'm totally fascinated by these Terabit DDoSes
[01:47:18.680 --> 01:47:21.680]   that are happening from internet of things devices.
[01:47:21.680 --> 01:47:24.960]   But first we are going to look at what happened last week
[01:47:24.960 --> 01:47:27.760]   on the Twit Network and see what's coming up ahead.
[01:47:27.760 --> 01:47:31.360]   - Previously on Twit.
[01:47:31.360 --> 01:47:32.720]   - I'm getting attacked.
[01:47:32.720 --> 01:47:35.960]   (all laughing)
[01:47:35.960 --> 01:47:36.800]   - Keep them over there.
[01:47:36.800 --> 01:47:38.000]   - Literally a collecting fly.
[01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:39.520]   - You are.
[01:47:39.520 --> 01:47:40.800]   - Home Theater Geeks.
[01:47:40.800 --> 01:47:44.680]   This week I'm in Petaluma, California at Leon Le Port's house.
[01:47:44.680 --> 01:47:49.680]   We are here to calibrate Leon Le Port's OLED TV.
[01:47:49.680 --> 01:47:51.600]   The new screensabers.
[01:47:51.600 --> 01:47:53.680]   - We have Rob Reiner who is starting
[01:47:53.680 --> 01:47:56.720]   the world's first bionic Olympics.
[01:47:56.720 --> 01:47:57.880]   - And that is so cool.
[01:47:57.880 --> 01:48:00.520]   - We're basically human and machine R1.
[01:48:00.520 --> 01:48:01.760]   - But we want to show with this.
[01:48:01.760 --> 01:48:05.160]   It's not only the best technology existing,
[01:48:05.160 --> 01:48:08.080]   we also want to show the problems still existing
[01:48:08.080 --> 01:48:09.960]   by applying these technologies.
[01:48:09.960 --> 01:48:11.880]   And in this way promote the development
[01:48:11.880 --> 01:48:14.360]   of better technologies in the future.
[01:48:14.360 --> 01:48:15.680]   - Security now.
[01:48:15.680 --> 01:48:20.680]   - As many as 500 million Yahoo accounts were breached,
[01:48:20.680 --> 01:48:26.120]   sometime in the past, and they didn't tell anybody.
[01:48:26.120 --> 01:48:27.760]   - Well, okay, if I change my password,
[01:48:27.760 --> 01:48:29.880]   if I use a strong password, is that enough?
[01:48:29.880 --> 01:48:32.480]   Or do I consider my accounts dead now?
[01:48:32.480 --> 01:48:35.040]   - How do you feel about Yahoo?
[01:48:35.040 --> 01:48:38.840]   - Does their behavior inspire confidence?
[01:48:38.840 --> 01:48:40.680]   - And that answer should be no.
[01:48:40.680 --> 01:48:42.560]   - Yeah, it really should be no.
[01:48:42.560 --> 01:48:45.640]   - Twit, making the world safe for technology.
[01:48:45.640 --> 01:48:47.160]   - When we try to get him.
[01:48:47.160 --> 01:48:49.080]   (laughing)
[01:48:49.080 --> 01:48:50.840]   - Sorry, I kind of got him.
[01:48:50.840 --> 01:48:53.440]   - She wasn't even aiming for the flying.
[01:48:53.440 --> 01:48:54.600]   - Sorry.
[01:48:54.600 --> 01:48:55.440]   - Sorry.
[01:48:55.440 --> 01:48:56.280]   - That really hurts.
[01:48:56.280 --> 01:48:58.760]   (laughing)
[01:48:58.760 --> 01:49:02.480]   - That was the past, and this is the future.
[01:49:02.480 --> 01:49:04.320]   - Hey thanks Becky, here are a few things
[01:49:04.320 --> 01:49:06.560]   that we're gonna be keeping a close eye on
[01:49:06.560 --> 01:49:11.080]   in the week ahead, and boy, what a week for events it is.
[01:49:11.080 --> 01:49:13.400]   Starting Tuesday, October 4th.
[01:49:13.400 --> 01:49:15.560]   First of all, that's a big day for Google.
[01:49:15.560 --> 01:49:17.360]   It has a hardware announcement that morning
[01:49:17.360 --> 01:49:20.720]   being held at 10 a.m. Pacific, 1 p.m. Eastern.
[01:49:20.720 --> 01:49:23.800]   Google's expected to show off its new pixel lineup of phones,
[01:49:23.800 --> 01:49:27.520]   Google Home, a 4K Chromecast, a new router,
[01:49:27.520 --> 01:49:31.920]   and possibly just maybe reveal its shift to Andromeda,
[01:49:31.920 --> 01:49:33.880]   which would be the long-awaited convergence
[01:49:33.880 --> 01:49:35.720]   of Android and Chrome OS.
[01:49:35.720 --> 01:49:37.760]   We're gonna be doing live coverage that morning,
[01:49:37.760 --> 01:49:39.080]   so don't miss that.
[01:49:39.080 --> 01:49:42.240]   Also on October 4th, Dreamforce 2016,
[01:49:42.240 --> 01:49:46.120]   the annual event led by Salesforce kicks off in San Francisco.
[01:49:46.120 --> 01:49:48.000]   Mega Moroni will of course be on hand
[01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:49.680]   to cover the big news from the event.
[01:49:49.680 --> 01:49:52.360]   That coverage will be published as a Twitch special.
[01:49:52.360 --> 01:49:55.800]   Oculus Connect 3 developers conference kicks off
[01:49:55.800 --> 01:49:57.400]   on Wednesday, October 5th.
[01:49:57.400 --> 01:49:59.480]   I'm actually gonna be in San Jose at the event
[01:49:59.480 --> 01:50:02.800]   with a crew to cover the event on Thursday, October 6th.
[01:50:02.800 --> 01:50:04.880]   So again, check out our Twitch specials
[01:50:04.880 --> 01:50:07.600]   for all the neat VR stuff that I'm sure to uncover
[01:50:07.600 --> 01:50:08.440]   while I'm there.
[01:50:08.440 --> 01:50:11.040]   Also on October 5th, Apple will begin to show ads
[01:50:11.040 --> 01:50:14.680]   for competing apps when you run searches inside the app store.
[01:50:14.680 --> 01:50:16.640]   That's part of its search ads program
[01:50:16.640 --> 01:50:18.840]   that's been in beta testing for a few months now.
[01:50:18.840 --> 01:50:21.760]   Ads for apps will be notated as such
[01:50:21.760 --> 01:50:24.560]   with a little blue badge, so there's no confusion.
[01:50:24.560 --> 01:50:26.280]   Mega Moroni and I will cover all of this
[01:50:26.280 --> 01:50:28.560]   in a whole lot more all week on Tech News today,
[01:50:28.560 --> 01:50:30.320]   and wouldn't you know it, Becky?
[01:50:30.320 --> 01:50:32.680]   You're gonna be on with us on tomorrow's episode.
[01:50:32.680 --> 01:50:34.240]   Really looking forward to that.
[01:50:34.240 --> 01:50:36.080]   All right, that's a look at the week ahead.
[01:50:36.080 --> 01:50:37.520]   Back to you.
[01:50:37.520 --> 01:50:38.440]   - You are correct.
[01:50:38.440 --> 01:50:40.440]   I will indeed be doing that.
[01:50:40.440 --> 01:50:41.840]   And as we look forward to the week,
[01:50:41.840 --> 01:50:43.040]   we gotta take care of business.
[01:50:43.040 --> 01:50:45.680]   Leo here to tell us who is supporting this episode
[01:50:45.680 --> 01:50:46.800]   of This Week in Tech.
[01:50:46.800 --> 01:50:48.480]   - I just saw, oh, thank you guys.
[01:50:48.480 --> 01:50:50.280]   We'll be back to the panel in just a moment,
[01:50:50.280 --> 01:50:51.880]   but first I wanna tell you about FreshBooks,
[01:50:51.880 --> 01:50:52.800]   long time sponsor.
[01:50:52.800 --> 01:50:55.440]   I've been a customer of theirs for years as a freelancer
[01:50:55.440 --> 01:50:57.320]   is when I own my own business, and that was just me.
[01:50:57.320 --> 01:50:58.880]   I use FreshBooks to save my life,
[01:50:58.880 --> 01:51:00.600]   and I just, they just show me their new platform,
[01:51:00.600 --> 01:51:02.400]   which is just now launching.
[01:51:02.400 --> 01:51:06.960]   Wow, wow, they have got better and better and better.
[01:51:06.960 --> 01:51:07.800]   So what is FreshBooks?
[01:51:07.800 --> 01:51:09.200]   Well, FreshBooks, the idea is
[01:51:09.200 --> 01:51:12.200]   you're a small business, you're an individual owner.
[01:51:12.200 --> 01:51:16.840]   And you, what's amazing is how many businesses
[01:51:16.840 --> 01:51:18.840]   don't even know if they're making a profit.
[01:51:18.840 --> 01:51:20.200]   Don't even know where they stand,
[01:51:20.200 --> 01:51:25.200]   like accounts receivable, income booked, costs,
[01:51:25.200 --> 01:51:26.960]   they don't know any of this stuff.
[01:51:26.960 --> 01:51:28.400]   So FreshBooks makes all that easy.
[01:51:28.400 --> 01:51:30.200]   It's really designed around your invoicing,
[01:51:30.200 --> 01:51:32.080]   'cause that's how you get paid, right?
[01:51:32.080 --> 01:51:34.520]   So if you make invoices and you get paid,
[01:51:34.520 --> 01:51:36.920]   this is gonna simplify that process instantly.
[01:51:36.920 --> 01:51:38.880]   You, 30 seconds and you've got an invoice.
[01:51:38.880 --> 01:51:42.240]   Looks beautiful too, and invoice with your logo
[01:51:42.240 --> 01:51:43.320]   and all the information.
[01:51:43.320 --> 01:51:45.200]   You can also get time and hours in there
[01:51:45.200 --> 01:51:47.520]   and has timers on the app or on the website.
[01:51:47.520 --> 01:51:49.240]   They'll keep track of each project.
[01:51:49.240 --> 01:51:52.000]   You could even switch from project to project instantly.
[01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:53.720]   So you could do three things at once,
[01:51:53.720 --> 01:51:58.400]   and it's really, the new interface is fantastic.
[01:51:58.400 --> 01:52:00.400]   The dashboard shows you immediately.
[01:52:00.400 --> 01:52:01.240]   Am I making money?
[01:52:01.240 --> 01:52:02.080]   You're losing money?
[01:52:02.080 --> 01:52:02.920]   What are my expenses?
[01:52:02.920 --> 01:52:05.440]   What bills have not been paid?
[01:52:05.440 --> 01:52:07.240]   You know who owes me money?
[01:52:07.240 --> 01:52:09.240]   You see that right away.
[01:52:09.240 --> 01:52:11.080]   So you're no more mystery.
[01:52:11.080 --> 01:52:13.080]   And when it comes time to do the taxes
[01:52:13.080 --> 01:52:15.040]   or you have an account and you wanna bring them the books,
[01:52:15.040 --> 01:52:16.640]   they've got reports that every account,
[01:52:16.640 --> 01:52:18.240]   the Prop P and L statement and all that,
[01:52:18.240 --> 01:52:19.880]   but you're not dealing at that level.
[01:52:19.880 --> 01:52:21.680]   Basically, the way FreshBooks works,
[01:52:21.680 --> 01:52:25.160]   you do the stuff you do and you need to do day in day out,
[01:52:25.160 --> 01:52:27.600]   and it's automatically kind of keeping the books
[01:52:27.600 --> 01:52:29.240]   for you around it.
[01:52:29.240 --> 01:52:31.080]   And it all starts with sending out invoices,
[01:52:31.080 --> 01:52:32.520]   getting paid faster.
[01:52:32.520 --> 01:52:37.160]   You can have auto payment reminders.
[01:52:37.160 --> 01:52:39.960]   If you have expenses, you could snap photos of receipts,
[01:52:39.960 --> 01:52:42.840]   put them in the expenses, bill people.
[01:52:42.840 --> 01:52:45.240]   You can get a project deposit,
[01:52:45.240 --> 01:52:48.120]   which lets you invoice for a payment upfront,
[01:52:48.120 --> 01:52:50.280]   so you're not out of pocket.
[01:52:50.280 --> 01:52:52.040]   I could just go on and on, but I think the best thing
[01:52:52.040 --> 01:52:57.040]   to do is try it by going to freshbooks.com/twit,
[01:52:57.040 --> 01:53:00.480]   and you get a 30 day free trial.
[01:53:00.480 --> 01:53:02.560]   And I think if you've not used FreshBooks before
[01:53:02.560 --> 01:53:03.880]   or even if you are using it
[01:53:03.880 --> 01:53:06.520]   and you haven't seen the new interface, do this.
[01:53:06.520 --> 01:53:08.120]   Awesome.
[01:53:08.120 --> 01:53:09.800]   Now, if you're existing customers,
[01:53:09.800 --> 01:53:11.520]   they'll give you a chance to migrate over time
[01:53:11.520 --> 01:53:13.160]   or you can stick with FreshBooks Classic,
[01:53:13.160 --> 01:53:14.040]   they're calling it now,
[01:53:14.040 --> 01:53:15.760]   but this new interface is spectacular.
[01:53:15.760 --> 01:53:18.400]   FreshBooks.com/twit,
[01:53:18.400 --> 01:53:21.760]   it is you wanna do what you do best.
[01:53:21.760 --> 01:53:25.120]   You know, I just wanted to do the shows.
[01:53:25.120 --> 01:53:28.080]   I didn't wanna, the invoicing was, you know,
[01:53:28.080 --> 01:53:30.640]   a necessary evil, keeping my books,
[01:53:30.640 --> 01:53:32.480]   keeping track of what's going on was a necessary evil,
[01:53:32.480 --> 01:53:35.000]   but it is necessary or you don't get to pay the rent.
[01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:38.200]   So this way I could focus on what I love
[01:53:38.200 --> 01:53:40.120]   and let FreshBooks do the hard stuff.
[01:53:40.120 --> 01:53:42.480]   It's so easy, so great.
[01:53:42.480 --> 01:53:43.600]   I think you'll love it.
[01:53:43.600 --> 01:53:44.920]   And it's by the beautiful.
[01:53:44.920 --> 01:53:47.680]   FreshBooks.com/twit, try it.
[01:53:47.680 --> 01:53:49.440]   And if they ask you, where'd you hear about us?
[01:53:49.440 --> 01:53:51.160]   I think there's somewhere in the form they say that.
[01:53:51.160 --> 01:53:53.400]   Just right in this weekend, tech, would you?
[01:53:53.400 --> 01:53:55.560]   So they know where you heard it.
[01:53:55.560 --> 01:53:59.360]   Nice guys too, they're Canadian, so you know they're nice.
[01:53:59.360 --> 01:54:02.960]   FreshBooks.com/twit,
[01:54:02.960 --> 01:54:05.160]   we thank you for their support now.
[01:54:05.160 --> 01:54:07.080]   Back we go to this week's panel,
[01:54:07.080 --> 01:54:08.880]   and again, I'll be back next week.
[01:54:08.880 --> 01:54:12.280]   So thank you so much for doing such a great job without me.
[01:54:12.280 --> 01:54:14.240]   Do you want me back next week?
[01:54:14.240 --> 01:54:17.040]   Yes, yes, of course.
[01:54:17.040 --> 01:54:18.680]   Leo, come home.
[01:54:18.680 --> 01:54:20.920]   You guys can't see it, but Aussie Leo's dog,
[01:54:20.920 --> 01:54:22.280]   Lisa's dog, Leo's dog,
[01:54:22.280 --> 01:54:24.560]   is cruising the studio here looking for
[01:54:24.560 --> 01:54:26.160]   when mom and dad are coming home.
[01:54:26.160 --> 01:54:30.520]   Moving to, Christina, you said you were working this week
[01:54:30.520 --> 01:54:32.600]   on problems, people were having with the iPhone 7,
[01:54:32.600 --> 01:54:35.440]   specifically with Bluetooth, interested in this.
[01:54:35.440 --> 01:54:38.320]   Yeah, so we put out a call just to kind of see,
[01:54:38.320 --> 01:54:40.680]   you know, if anybody thought that,
[01:54:40.680 --> 01:54:43.360]   you know, if anybody was having any prevalent issues
[01:54:43.360 --> 01:54:44.960]   with the iPhone 7 or 7 Plus,
[01:54:44.960 --> 01:54:46.520]   I mean, I've got the 7 Plus,
[01:54:46.520 --> 01:54:48.040]   and I've been using it since it came out.
[01:54:48.040 --> 01:54:50.520]   And I've had a couple of issues with Bluetooth.
[01:54:50.520 --> 01:54:51.920]   I know that a lot of people,
[01:54:51.920 --> 01:54:52.760]   some people have too.
[01:54:52.760 --> 01:54:55.960]   My big issue was actually been with losing LTE signal
[01:54:55.960 --> 01:54:57.120]   on my Verizon user,
[01:54:57.120 --> 01:54:59.880]   and my Verizon signal will sometimes just lose LTE,
[01:54:59.880 --> 01:55:01.360]   and it'll come back to 3G,
[01:55:01.360 --> 01:55:03.160]   but if I want to get it back to LTE,
[01:55:03.160 --> 01:55:05.600]   I'll have to toggle airplane mode on or off.
[01:55:05.600 --> 01:55:09.000]   I've got about 50 or 60 people who've also reported
[01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.160]   some connectivity issues with their iPhone 7s,
[01:55:11.160 --> 01:55:13.440]   but Bluetooth was the issue that I was starting
[01:55:13.440 --> 01:55:14.800]   getting back just in droves.
[01:55:14.800 --> 01:55:16.720]   And so I don't know if this is an iOS 10 issue,
[01:55:16.720 --> 01:55:18.080]   'cause I know you were saying,
[01:55:18.080 --> 01:55:19.560]   you had some issues with that or what,
[01:55:19.560 --> 01:55:21.880]   but a lot of people are having problems connecting
[01:55:21.880 --> 01:55:23.840]   their new phones to their cars.
[01:55:23.840 --> 01:55:26.200]   And so they're also having some problems,
[01:55:26.200 --> 01:55:27.760]   connecting it to other devices.
[01:55:27.760 --> 01:55:31.040]   And so the Bluetooth just seems to be,
[01:55:31.040 --> 01:55:33.040]   the software seems to be having some problems.
[01:55:33.040 --> 01:55:34.440]   And so that's been something I'm,
[01:55:34.440 --> 01:55:35.880]   I've continued to get emails about,
[01:55:35.880 --> 01:55:39.000]   I probably received 30 or 40 of them this weekend
[01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.160]   from additional people just saying,
[01:55:41.160 --> 01:55:43.800]   yes, I too am having problems connecting to Bluetooth
[01:55:43.800 --> 01:55:46.120]   with my new phone.
[01:55:46.120 --> 01:55:48.720]   - When I updated the software,
[01:55:48.720 --> 01:55:52.040]   it's not on an iPhone 7, but on my iPhone 6s,
[01:55:52.040 --> 01:55:53.800]   had trouble with the front door in my house,
[01:55:53.800 --> 01:55:57.680]   'cause it's a Bluetooth lock and wasn't working,
[01:55:57.680 --> 01:55:59.680]   which is a little disconcerting, I have to say,
[01:55:59.680 --> 01:56:01.840]   when it comes to stuff like your front door
[01:56:01.840 --> 01:56:04.360]   and getting into your house, it's kind of nerve-wracking.
[01:56:04.360 --> 01:56:08.320]   And it made me realize how tolerant I am of tech issues,
[01:56:08.320 --> 01:56:10.600]   but then when it comes to your actual home
[01:56:10.600 --> 01:56:12.160]   and what's going on, it's kind of like,
[01:56:12.160 --> 01:56:14.800]   oh, no, I don't think so.
[01:56:14.800 --> 01:56:16.640]   But yeah, had that issue.
[01:56:16.640 --> 01:56:19.920]   Were you also testing the cameras?
[01:56:19.920 --> 01:56:21.440]   - Yeah, we also tested the cameras.
[01:56:21.440 --> 01:56:23.320]   And I love the new cameras.
[01:56:23.320 --> 01:56:27.720]   We did a camera shoot out between the Galaxy S7
[01:56:27.720 --> 01:56:30.520]   and the iPhone 6s and the iPhone 7.
[01:56:30.520 --> 01:56:33.840]   And I think that for certain detail in certain situations,
[01:56:33.840 --> 01:56:35.680]   the S7 is a little bit better,
[01:56:35.680 --> 01:56:38.640]   but overall our conclusion, I didn't do the test,
[01:56:38.640 --> 01:56:42.040]   our reviews editor did, but I certainly,
[01:56:42.040 --> 01:56:43.760]   this matches my experience too.
[01:56:43.760 --> 01:56:46.440]   I personally think that overall the iPhone 7,
[01:56:46.440 --> 01:56:49.080]   just barely edges out, yeah, the S7 camera
[01:56:49.080 --> 01:56:51.160]   and it's probably the best all around smartphone camera
[01:56:51.160 --> 01:56:52.480]   on the market right now.
[01:56:52.480 --> 01:56:54.120]   - That sounds like you just tricked yourself
[01:56:54.120 --> 01:56:55.760]   how Apple does with things.
[01:56:55.760 --> 01:56:58.680]   You literally almost said that the Galaxy
[01:56:58.680 --> 01:57:00.400]   was a better camera, but you feel--
[01:57:00.400 --> 01:57:01.920]   - Well, in certain things.
[01:57:01.920 --> 01:57:03.200]   - No, no, no, no, no, 'cause color--
[01:57:03.200 --> 01:57:04.320]   - You produce-- - Here's the thing.
[01:57:04.320 --> 01:57:05.880]   No, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:57:05.880 --> 01:57:08.320]   Color-wise, the iPhone is significantly better.
[01:57:08.320 --> 01:57:10.080]   And that's, for me, I think overall,
[01:57:10.080 --> 01:57:11.680]   the better experience of what the Zoom,
[01:57:11.680 --> 01:57:13.960]   for certain detail things with certain shots,
[01:57:13.960 --> 01:57:17.240]   with certain scenarios, you will get a better image
[01:57:17.240 --> 01:57:20.480]   with the Galaxy S7, but if you are,
[01:57:20.480 --> 01:57:23.040]   which I like taking overall like low light,
[01:57:23.040 --> 01:57:26.480]   bright light, overcast, just kind of the entire spectrum,
[01:57:26.480 --> 01:57:28.520]   they're close, but at this point,
[01:57:28.520 --> 01:57:31.760]   whereas it used to be like the S7 was not significantly,
[01:57:31.760 --> 01:57:34.720]   but was visibly better than the 6S.
[01:57:34.720 --> 01:57:36.280]   I think at this point that the 7,
[01:57:36.280 --> 01:57:38.120]   especially with its color accuracy,
[01:57:38.120 --> 01:57:40.840]   is better than the S7, they're close,
[01:57:40.840 --> 01:57:42.880]   but I think they just barely eked it out.
[01:57:42.880 --> 01:57:45.120]   - Well, maybe Apple should work on their magic
[01:57:45.120 --> 01:57:46.960]   and courage for their Bluetooth problems,
[01:57:46.960 --> 01:57:48.680]   because if you don't have a headphone jack,
[01:57:48.680 --> 01:57:51.480]   you're kind of screwed with all that magic and courage
[01:57:51.480 --> 01:57:53.000]   is crap that they sold people on,
[01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:55.680]   with their little crappy buds and all that junk.
[01:57:55.680 --> 01:57:57.520]   - No, I asked you, I told that irony,
[01:57:57.520 --> 01:57:58.760]   I do think that it's like the one thing
[01:57:58.760 --> 01:57:59.600]   you couldn't scare people,
[01:57:59.600 --> 01:58:01.120]   your Bluetooth stack and the Bluetooth stack
[01:58:01.120 --> 01:58:03.320]   is something wrong.
[01:58:03.320 --> 01:58:05.560]   - I have problems too, I can't get it connect to my car.
[01:58:05.560 --> 01:58:09.000]   It connects to my car in weird ways, the 7S does.
[01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.520]   And so, yeah, it's--
[01:58:11.520 --> 01:58:14.240]   - It makes kind of fits.
[01:58:14.240 --> 01:58:16.160]   - Guys, I've been checking my watch through this,
[01:58:16.160 --> 01:58:18.440]   'cause I feel like, you know, we've talked about this Apple issue,
[01:58:18.440 --> 01:58:19.600]   we've talked about the iPhones,
[01:58:19.600 --> 01:58:20.760]   we're four and a half minutes in,
[01:58:20.760 --> 01:58:22.920]   and I think we've tapped out on all Apple issues
[01:58:22.920 --> 01:58:24.400]   that we need to discuss today.
[01:58:24.400 --> 01:58:26.920]   I just wanna say, it can be done, there you have it.
[01:58:26.920 --> 01:58:28.560]   (laughing)
[01:58:28.560 --> 01:58:31.160]   - I would try to be one on the S7 versus,
[01:58:31.160 --> 01:58:34.080]   so my work phone is Galaxy S7 Edge,
[01:58:34.080 --> 01:58:38.800]   my personal phone is the iPhone 7 Plus.
[01:58:38.800 --> 01:58:41.920]   So I use both of them pretty regularly.
[01:58:41.920 --> 01:58:45.720]   They are, there are some things that they,
[01:58:45.720 --> 01:58:50.360]   some photos that each one takes better pictures than the other.
[01:58:50.360 --> 01:58:55.160]   The S7, I feel like, for close-ups,
[01:58:55.160 --> 01:58:58.400]   and it gets detail really, really well,
[01:58:58.400 --> 01:58:59.880]   I feel like the low light,
[01:58:59.880 --> 01:59:02.880]   I've had a little better experience in low light with the S7,
[01:59:02.880 --> 01:59:07.200]   the iPhone 7 Plus,
[01:59:07.200 --> 01:59:09.360]   as you talked about, Christina,
[01:59:09.360 --> 01:59:13.320]   the color in that, the vibrancy, the color is pretty impressive.
[01:59:13.320 --> 01:59:16.520]   They obviously spent a good deal of time on that.
[01:59:16.520 --> 01:59:20.120]   The colors aren't quite as washed out, they're more vibrant,
[01:59:20.120 --> 01:59:21.720]   and so that's pretty cool,
[01:59:21.720 --> 01:59:25.160]   and obviously the Zoom performance.
[01:59:25.160 --> 01:59:26.800]   - Which one's better, Jason, make a decision,
[01:59:26.800 --> 01:59:27.640]   get off the fence.
[01:59:27.640 --> 01:59:29.360]   - Man, I couldn't, I couldn't,
[01:59:29.360 --> 01:59:32.080]   but I tell you what, you have both of those,
[01:59:32.080 --> 01:59:35.960]   it's pretty amazing what a phone can do now.
[01:59:35.960 --> 01:59:39.160]   I think those two are both such a leap forward
[01:59:39.160 --> 01:59:43.920]   from their predecessors that if you have one of those two phones,
[01:59:43.920 --> 01:59:47.120]   you're feeling pretty stoked about the kind of photos
[01:59:47.120 --> 01:59:48.960]   you can take with a phone now.
[01:59:48.960 --> 01:59:52.280]   - Cameras continue to be such an impetus for upgrades,
[01:59:52.280 --> 01:59:55.040]   and I think they have, that's just been consistent,
[01:59:55.040 --> 01:59:57.480]   and I think that will continue to be,
[01:59:57.480 --> 01:59:59.800]   it's definitely something that you think about,
[01:59:59.800 --> 02:00:02.880]   just over time as you look at the quality of your phone pictures
[02:00:02.880 --> 02:00:05.600]   having increased, it's incredible, it's such a boom.
[02:00:05.600 --> 02:00:07.720]   - One of the challenges is those two companies,
[02:00:07.720 --> 02:00:11.400]   Samsung and Apple, they buy up all the good sensors.
[02:00:11.400 --> 02:00:14.840]   - Yeah, exactly, so nobody else can get them.
[02:00:14.840 --> 02:00:17.240]   - Every time Sony comes out with a new sensor,
[02:00:17.240 --> 02:00:20.280]   Sony makes the best sort of small sensors in the world.
[02:00:20.280 --> 02:00:23.840]   Every time Sony comes out with a new sensor,
[02:00:23.840 --> 02:00:27.000]   Apple essentially buys the whole new lineup
[02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.480]   before anybody else can even get it.
[02:00:29.480 --> 02:00:31.560]   It's like the reverse flooding of a market,
[02:00:31.560 --> 02:00:33.520]   they completely like corner of the market
[02:00:33.520 --> 02:00:35.000]   of all the good sensors, and of course, Samsung
[02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:38.360]   can do much of the same thing,
[02:00:38.360 --> 02:00:41.680]   but the latest sensors are in those two
[02:00:41.680 --> 02:00:43.600]   because those two just essentially buy up
[02:00:43.600 --> 02:00:45.800]   every latest sensor they can get a hold of.
[02:00:45.800 --> 02:00:50.040]   - A story that's been developing over the last little bit
[02:00:50.040 --> 02:00:54.160]   on September 16th, Krebs Unsecurity, a great site
[02:00:54.160 --> 02:00:56.400]   that really digs deep into issues of security,
[02:00:56.400 --> 02:00:59.320]   was taken offline with a DDOS attack,
[02:00:59.320 --> 02:01:04.280]   and it wasn't your average distributed denial of service.
[02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:08.920]   This was recording one terabit per second
[02:01:08.920 --> 02:01:12.720]   incoming traffic requests, which is unprecedented really
[02:01:12.720 --> 02:01:17.720]   in its volume, Akamai, which is their redundancy server,
[02:01:17.720 --> 02:01:18.640]   I don't even know if you call it that anymore,
[02:01:18.640 --> 02:01:23.320]   it's redundancy server, it's a backup service.
[02:01:23.320 --> 02:01:25.880]   At a certain point told them we can't handle it,
[02:01:25.880 --> 02:01:28.240]   even we are maxed out.
[02:01:28.240 --> 02:01:29.800]   So the site went down for a little while,
[02:01:29.800 --> 02:01:33.120]   and then Brian Krebs, I don't know if you petitioned Google
[02:01:33.120 --> 02:01:35.680]   or if they came to him, but they have this Google Shield
[02:01:35.680 --> 02:01:38.720]   program that helps to keep sites that have been taken offline
[02:01:38.720 --> 02:01:41.360]   through denial of service attacks.
[02:01:41.360 --> 02:01:44.120]   They came and put a site back on because only Google
[02:01:44.120 --> 02:01:47.200]   would have the server power in the bandwidth,
[02:01:47.200 --> 02:01:48.720]   you have to handle that.
[02:01:48.720 --> 02:01:51.600]   But what's really interesting is that,
[02:01:51.600 --> 02:01:56.440]   I've seen numbers anywhere from 150,000 internet of things
[02:01:56.440 --> 02:02:00.200]   devices are the source of the incoming traffic,
[02:02:00.200 --> 02:02:04.200]   all the way up to a million IoT devices being the source
[02:02:04.200 --> 02:02:06.920]   of all this traffic.
[02:02:06.920 --> 02:02:10.800]   And what just happened, Krebs published Friday,
[02:02:10.800 --> 02:02:14.480]   is that the source code for this distributed denial of service
[02:02:14.480 --> 02:02:19.440]   attack using compromised IoT devices has been made public.
[02:02:19.440 --> 02:02:22.560]   And so we are only going to see more of this.
[02:02:22.560 --> 02:02:25.720]   It's called the botnet Marai.
[02:02:25.720 --> 02:02:27.840]   And the scary thing-- well, not scary,
[02:02:27.840 --> 02:02:29.840]   I don't want to get too much hyperbole in here,
[02:02:29.840 --> 02:02:31.880]   but the interesting thing is how difficult it's
[02:02:31.880 --> 02:02:36.640]   going to be to secure all of these devices.
[02:02:36.640 --> 02:02:38.680]   I'm a consumer reporter, and so I'm thinking,
[02:02:38.680 --> 02:02:40.440]   oh, this is a pretty interesting story.
[02:02:40.440 --> 02:02:42.600]   I don't want to get-- it's only a denial of service attack.
[02:02:42.600 --> 02:02:47.640]   It's not like it's going to take down your bank per se,
[02:02:47.640 --> 02:02:51.000]   or at least your ability to get money out of your bank.
[02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:54.320]   But I just think, is this something that interests you,
[02:02:54.320 --> 02:02:55.640]   worries you?
[02:02:55.640 --> 02:02:59.160]   You see this as a future trend?
[02:02:59.160 --> 02:03:00.160]   Totally, right?
[02:03:00.160 --> 02:03:01.440]   I mean, this is what's so fascinating.
[02:03:01.440 --> 02:03:05.320]   I mean, I think to me, like you said,
[02:03:05.320 --> 02:03:06.880]   you're a consumer person, I am too.
[02:03:06.880 --> 02:03:09.160]   And I think about-- we've been talking
[02:03:09.160 --> 02:03:11.160]   about the security of these internet of things devices
[02:03:11.160 --> 02:03:13.800]   for a long time, and I guess trying to encourage people
[02:03:13.800 --> 02:03:15.280]   to make sure your routers are secure,
[02:03:15.280 --> 02:03:17.120]   make sure you have other things, you have good passwords
[02:03:17.120 --> 02:03:18.920]   on these systems or something else.
[02:03:18.920 --> 02:03:20.560]   But I think that the interesting thing is--
[02:03:20.560 --> 02:03:24.120]   even though you're right, it's basically just a botnet
[02:03:24.120 --> 02:03:25.200]   of DDOS.
[02:03:25.200 --> 02:03:28.000]   Right now, it's nothing potentially too inconsequential.
[02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:30.240]   But the fact that they can be weaponized this way,
[02:03:30.240 --> 02:03:33.480]   and the fact that it's going to be for a lot of these devices
[02:03:33.480 --> 02:03:36.600]   impossible for them ever to be updated, to be patched,
[02:03:36.600 --> 02:03:38.960]   that to me is what's really interesting.
[02:03:38.960 --> 02:03:42.080]   Because when things happen like heartbleed,
[02:03:42.080 --> 02:03:43.560]   when that happened a couple of years ago,
[02:03:43.560 --> 02:03:46.240]   a lot of people's concerns was, well, if this had happened,
[02:03:46.240 --> 02:03:48.560]   when the internet of things era was broader,
[02:03:48.560 --> 02:03:50.560]   this would have been even more potentially bad.
[02:03:50.560 --> 02:03:51.760]   But now you see something like this,
[02:03:51.760 --> 02:03:54.360]   where people are taking advantage of insecure devices.
[02:03:54.360 --> 02:03:59.360]   And today it's a DDOS botnet, but tomorrow
[02:03:59.360 --> 02:04:00.680]   it could be something more sinister.
[02:04:00.680 --> 02:04:04.240]   And I think that it opens up a lot of questions about the fact
[02:04:04.240 --> 02:04:07.320]   that the security aspect for internet of things
[02:04:07.320 --> 02:04:08.720]   has never been at the forefront,
[02:04:08.720 --> 02:04:10.480]   and nobody's really focused on it.
[02:04:10.480 --> 02:04:12.080]   And people are buying these things and putting them
[02:04:12.080 --> 02:04:14.480]   in their homes and not realizing this
[02:04:14.480 --> 02:04:17.480]   has a connection to a server, to an internet, it's pinae,
[02:04:17.480 --> 02:04:18.520]   something somewhere.
[02:04:18.520 --> 02:04:20.520]   And it's very difficult, if not impossible,
[02:04:20.520 --> 02:04:23.200]   for the regular user to even think about securing them.
[02:04:23.200 --> 02:04:25.640]   And a lot of times the companies who are involved
[02:04:25.640 --> 02:04:27.600]   with making these devices don't care either.
[02:04:27.600 --> 02:04:29.960]   And so I think it opens up a lot of interesting questions.
[02:04:29.960 --> 02:04:31.480]   - Is this something I was looking up,
[02:04:31.480 --> 02:04:33.520]   can you secure a password?
[02:04:33.520 --> 02:04:34.760]   That's not really the issue here.
[02:04:34.760 --> 02:04:38.000]   These were CCTV cameras that were being used
[02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:40.000]   in most of this attack.
[02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:41.600]   But if you think about it,
[02:04:41.600 --> 02:04:44.520]   there's a hugely long lifecycle on a lot of these products,
[02:04:44.520 --> 02:04:45.520]   'cause they're home products,
[02:04:45.520 --> 02:04:47.280]   or things that we use more as utilities
[02:04:47.280 --> 02:04:49.320]   than necessarily as like gadgets
[02:04:49.320 --> 02:04:51.200]   that we're gonna upgrade all the time.
[02:04:51.200 --> 02:04:54.360]   If the companies aren't doing security updates,
[02:04:54.360 --> 02:04:57.160]   well, then that leaves you with little recourse.
[02:04:57.160 --> 02:04:58.680]   And it's really hard to figure out
[02:04:58.680 --> 02:05:00.200]   if your device has been compromised.
[02:05:00.200 --> 02:05:01.760]   I mean, one of the things I was listening to,
[02:05:01.760 --> 02:05:04.600]   Steve Gibson talk on security now.
[02:05:04.600 --> 02:05:06.440]   And he was saying that the only,
[02:05:06.440 --> 02:05:07.640]   one of the only ways you can figure out
[02:05:07.640 --> 02:05:09.000]   if your device has been compromised
[02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:12.000]   is to check your traffic records,
[02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:15.200]   but then you have to know how much upstream traffic
[02:05:15.200 --> 02:05:17.640]   you were traditionally sending out,
[02:05:17.640 --> 02:05:19.520]   which how many people know that?
[02:05:20.560 --> 02:05:22.120]   It's crazy.
[02:05:22.120 --> 02:05:23.280]   Yeah, doesn't everybody know that?
[02:05:23.280 --> 02:05:24.360]   We don't get a report.
[02:05:24.360 --> 02:05:27.240]   I get a buy daily report.
[02:05:27.240 --> 02:05:28.400]   I hope you guys are up my team.
[02:05:28.400 --> 02:05:29.240]   I'm my fault.
[02:05:29.240 --> 02:05:30.680]   You guys obviously need to upgrade
[02:05:30.680 --> 02:05:32.360]   to life a little bit just, it's okay.
[02:05:32.360 --> 02:05:34.040]   I don't know what I'm thinking about pitching this story
[02:05:34.040 --> 02:05:36.560]   to GMA and doing this as a quick news story,
[02:05:36.560 --> 02:05:39.400]   but then I also don't want to--
[02:05:39.400 --> 02:05:40.920]   I'm not a little warm for people.
[02:05:40.920 --> 02:05:43.360]   Right, yeah, I mean, it's sort of one of those stories
[02:05:43.360 --> 02:05:44.600]   that's really interesting.
[02:05:44.600 --> 02:05:46.600]   It's a fascinating turn of events.
[02:05:46.600 --> 02:05:48.560]   We need to press your security companies
[02:05:48.560 --> 02:05:49.720]   to do security upgrades,
[02:05:49.720 --> 02:05:52.600]   but then again, I don't want to be overly dramatic
[02:05:52.600 --> 02:05:54.360]   with a general audience.
[02:05:54.360 --> 02:05:55.480]   And at the same time,
[02:05:55.480 --> 02:05:58.200]   people have to understand that a lot of things
[02:05:58.200 --> 02:05:59.960]   are going to be getting hacked in the future.
[02:05:59.960 --> 02:06:01.240]   The same way, like, you know,
[02:06:01.240 --> 02:06:03.320]   the big hack that was a big deal for a lot of people
[02:06:03.320 --> 02:06:06.480]   that don't care about hacking is when target got hacked.
[02:06:06.480 --> 02:06:10.960]   And all those not the stereotype target shoppers,
[02:06:10.960 --> 02:06:13.560]   but all those women that signed up for that target car
[02:06:13.560 --> 02:06:14.760]   so they can get their fireps off,
[02:06:14.760 --> 02:06:16.400]   I know a lot of people that are calling me up like,
[02:06:16.400 --> 02:06:17.880]   what's going on with this target thing?
[02:06:17.880 --> 02:06:19.680]   People that never cared anything about a computer,
[02:06:19.680 --> 02:06:21.160]   but they heard about a target hack
[02:06:21.160 --> 02:06:23.080]   and they freaked out lost their minds.
[02:06:23.080 --> 02:06:25.280]   So it's something that people should just be aware of
[02:06:25.280 --> 02:06:27.960]   that it happens and usually they can take care of you
[02:06:27.960 --> 02:06:29.680]   and take care of the situations,
[02:06:29.680 --> 02:06:32.160]   but sometimes some bad things might happen in the future.
[02:06:32.160 --> 02:06:37.160]   Yeah, this one's one to see if corporations figure it out
[02:06:37.160 --> 02:06:38.880]   and do the right thing.
[02:06:38.880 --> 02:06:42.480]   One more security story, the Yahoo data breach.
[02:06:42.480 --> 02:06:45.880]   So we're talking about half a billion accounts hacked.
[02:06:45.880 --> 02:06:46.720]   So bad.
[02:06:46.720 --> 02:06:48.640]   500 million accounts hacked.
[02:06:48.640 --> 02:06:50.800]   I mean, it was so active is the question though,
[02:06:50.800 --> 02:06:51.640]   but I'm pomps.
[02:06:51.640 --> 02:06:52.640]   Yeah.
[02:06:52.640 --> 02:06:53.960]   (laughs)
[02:06:53.960 --> 02:06:56.240]   I mean, honestly, if it's even a third, I mean.
[02:06:56.240 --> 02:06:57.080]   I know.
[02:06:57.080 --> 02:06:57.920]   I'm kind of be a legit,
[02:06:57.920 --> 02:06:59.760]   I've got three Yahoo accounts right now
[02:06:59.760 --> 02:07:01.320]   that I haven't checked in two plus years.
[02:07:01.320 --> 02:07:02.600]   What, why does that matter though?
[02:07:02.600 --> 02:07:04.560]   Because if people don't change their passwords
[02:07:04.560 --> 02:07:07.200]   and if they use the same logons,
[02:07:07.200 --> 02:07:10.400]   so it's right there, blank blank at yahoo.com,
[02:07:10.400 --> 02:07:11.360]   it doesn't matter.
[02:07:11.360 --> 02:07:16.240]   And so a couple things here, just some updates.
[02:07:16.240 --> 02:07:18.240]   Six senators wanting more details
[02:07:18.240 --> 02:07:20.520]   about the Yahoo data breach, the big issue.
[02:07:20.520 --> 02:07:23.360]   This happened in 2014, Yahoo only learned of it
[02:07:23.360 --> 02:07:27.600]   this past summer, but have only made this public.
[02:07:27.600 --> 02:07:31.300]   Recently, senators annoyed about the timeline.
[02:07:31.300 --> 02:07:37.360]   Also, I think what's really interesting is
[02:07:37.360 --> 02:07:40.760]   that Yahoo's accusing a state sponsored actor,
[02:07:40.760 --> 02:07:44.280]   but a security company, Infall Armor,
[02:07:44.280 --> 02:07:47.960]   they say that it has been sold,
[02:07:47.960 --> 02:07:51.040]   the whole entire database had been sold three times
[02:07:51.040 --> 02:07:53.640]   since it was compromised,
[02:07:53.640 --> 02:07:56.920]   including once to a state actor,
[02:07:56.920 --> 02:07:59.560]   but the hackers themselves, this is all from Infall Armor,
[02:07:59.560 --> 02:08:03.040]   this is their assertion, not corroborated by Yahoo.
[02:08:03.040 --> 02:08:07.480]   They, Infall Armor says the hackers are a private entity,
[02:08:07.480 --> 02:08:12.040]   and I think that the New York Times did a huge expose,
[02:08:12.040 --> 02:08:15.880]   really, which is interesting here that they said,
[02:08:15.880 --> 02:08:17.920]   created a comparison to Google,
[02:08:17.920 --> 02:08:20.000]   where after the Google hack in 2010,
[02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:22.760]   Sergey Brin doubled down on security,
[02:08:22.760 --> 02:08:24.800]   and they had this huge motto internally,
[02:08:24.800 --> 02:08:28.440]   never again spent hundreds of millions of dollars,
[02:08:28.440 --> 02:08:30.000]   and security was a huge deal.
[02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:33.120]   And then at Yahoo, their security team is called
[02:08:33.120 --> 02:08:36.360]   the paranoid, and they were pushed to the back
[02:08:36.360 --> 02:08:39.160]   because increasing security, creating any kind
[02:08:39.160 --> 02:08:40.560]   of two-factor authentication,
[02:08:40.560 --> 02:08:45.200]   even only recently having secure sign-ons,
[02:08:45.200 --> 02:08:50.920]   that that was perceived of, assuming from Marissa Meyer,
[02:08:50.920 --> 02:08:53.480]   that this is gonna make people stop
[02:08:53.480 --> 02:08:54.600]   using the company's product,
[02:08:54.600 --> 02:08:56.440]   and they were so desperate to hold on to users
[02:08:56.440 --> 02:08:58.360]   that they couldn't take that chance.
[02:08:58.360 --> 02:09:02.280]   - User hostile, I mean, good security can be hard, right?
[02:09:02.280 --> 02:09:03.880]   It can make things harder for users,
[02:09:03.880 --> 02:09:07.640]   it's why things like fingerprint scanners, right,
[02:09:07.640 --> 02:09:10.440]   where all of a sudden you scan that fingerprint,
[02:09:10.440 --> 02:09:15.400]   it's faster and easier than typing in a password,
[02:09:15.400 --> 02:09:16.480]   and it's also more secure,
[02:09:16.480 --> 02:09:17.960]   because there's hardware encryption behind it.
[02:09:17.960 --> 02:09:21.480]   Those are the kinds of solutions we need for security,
[02:09:21.480 --> 02:09:23.120]   and two-factor authentication,
[02:09:23.120 --> 02:09:25.520]   I know that it's a little bit of a pain,
[02:09:25.520 --> 02:09:27.800]   but I encourage everybody to do it now,
[02:09:27.800 --> 02:09:30.480]   that Twitter and Gmail do it,
[02:09:30.480 --> 02:09:33.880]   like everybody should be using two-factor.
[02:09:33.880 --> 02:09:36.480]   It's just a way of, it's like locking your front door,
[02:09:36.480 --> 02:09:39.720]   you know, everybody probably out there,
[02:09:39.720 --> 02:09:44.080]   unless you live way out in the rural area somewhere,
[02:09:44.080 --> 02:09:46.280]   you know, probably locking your front door, right?
[02:09:46.280 --> 02:09:48.520]   Two-factor authentication is just like locking the front door.
[02:09:48.520 --> 02:09:49.880]   - Unless the Bluetooth on your phone
[02:09:49.880 --> 02:09:51.760]   that unlocks the front door doesn't work.
[02:09:51.760 --> 02:09:54.760]   - Well, and you know, and the general conversation
[02:09:54.760 --> 02:09:56.960]   that locks are made for honest people,
[02:09:56.960 --> 02:09:58.440]   thieves are gonna get into things.
[02:09:58.440 --> 02:10:00.720]   The thing that always cracks me about these firms is,
[02:10:00.720 --> 02:10:03.040]   okay, so, Yahoo didn't know until 2014,
[02:10:03.040 --> 02:10:04.760]   but this firm says it was sold,
[02:10:04.760 --> 02:10:06.560]   so you know that it was sold three times,
[02:10:06.560 --> 02:10:07.840]   how do you know that?
[02:10:07.840 --> 02:10:09.440]   Where are you coming up with disinformation
[02:10:09.440 --> 02:10:11.360]   because I don't know, I'm not gonna say
[02:10:11.360 --> 02:10:12.400]   I know a lot about the black market,
[02:10:12.400 --> 02:10:13.760]   I'm just saying sometimes the black market,
[02:10:13.760 --> 02:10:15.960]   people don't really talk about the things they do,
[02:10:15.960 --> 02:10:17.800]   but you found out that it was sold like,
[02:10:17.800 --> 02:10:20.480]   it's just amazing things, these people say,
[02:10:20.480 --> 02:10:22.600]   when these things happen to try to like,
[02:10:22.600 --> 02:10:24.080]   explain things to people.
[02:10:24.080 --> 02:10:27.640]   I'm like, I can't even trust it when I hear things like that.
[02:10:27.640 --> 02:10:29.480]   - Nor should you, nor should you.
[02:10:29.480 --> 02:10:32.840]   I mean, that, so much of the problem we're in in this country
[02:10:32.840 --> 02:10:34.520]   is that everybody trusts what they hear,
[02:10:34.520 --> 02:10:37.600]   and they don't get two-factor verification
[02:10:37.600 --> 02:10:38.440]   of their spaces. - And there's nays,
[02:10:38.440 --> 02:10:39.920]   critical thinking.
[02:10:39.920 --> 02:10:42.920]   Yeah, our education system teaches,
[02:10:42.920 --> 02:10:46.040]   learning how to answer tests, not critical thinking,
[02:10:46.040 --> 02:10:46.960]   which is a big problem,
[02:10:46.960 --> 02:10:49.920]   but that's a whole nother topic for another day.
[02:10:49.920 --> 02:10:54.040]   So, but I do think that one of the challenges
[02:10:54.040 --> 02:10:57.800]   that we've got is with this era that we're going into,
[02:10:57.800 --> 02:11:01.600]   these products have got to be more secure, right?
[02:11:01.600 --> 02:11:04.320]   And the industry has got to be more secure.
[02:11:04.320 --> 02:11:06.480]   The tech industry has spent the last two decades
[02:11:06.480 --> 02:11:09.560]   focused on innovation, innovation, innovation,
[02:11:09.560 --> 02:11:12.280]   and security has been an afterthought.
[02:11:12.280 --> 02:11:15.200]   And that's why more and more you're gonna see the companies
[02:11:15.200 --> 02:11:18.200]   that have security baked in.
[02:11:18.200 --> 02:11:21.360]   They're going to, those are the products
[02:11:21.360 --> 02:11:22.920]   that companies are going to buy,
[02:11:22.920 --> 02:11:25.000]   and I'm speaking especially B2B market,
[02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:26.720]   'cause that's what I spend a lot of time in,
[02:11:26.720 --> 02:11:30.640]   but the products that have user trust,
[02:11:30.640 --> 02:11:32.280]   the companies that have user trust,
[02:11:32.280 --> 02:11:34.520]   that haven't been violated,
[02:11:34.520 --> 02:11:38.000]   haven't been, you know, had a major breach.
[02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:40.160]   Those are the solutions that are more in demand,
[02:11:40.160 --> 02:11:42.000]   and you can expect that to be the case.
[02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:43.800]   And all these things eventually,
[02:11:43.800 --> 02:11:46.240]   it's gonna filter down to the consumer as well,
[02:11:46.240 --> 02:11:49.240]   that, you know, that trust with companies,
[02:11:49.240 --> 02:11:52.040]   it's gonna be the same way with Samsung
[02:11:52.040 --> 02:11:55.080]   and their brand with, you know, things blowing up.
[02:11:55.080 --> 02:11:57.240]   It's gonna be, you know, if there are brands
[02:11:57.240 --> 02:12:00.640]   that you hear about keep getting compromised,
[02:12:00.640 --> 02:12:02.200]   users are gonna, you know, trust them
[02:12:02.200 --> 02:12:04.360]   with their data less and less.
[02:12:04.360 --> 02:12:10.080]   So this stuff is all big, it's all important.
[02:12:10.080 --> 02:12:12.840]   We wrote a big special report about this
[02:12:12.840 --> 02:12:15.160]   in September on Tech Republican ZDNet,
[02:12:15.160 --> 02:12:19.520]   about cybersecurity and the fact that this stuff
[02:12:19.520 --> 02:12:23.360]   has bigger consequences now because, you know,
[02:12:23.360 --> 02:12:26.360]   governments and public entities use these things.
[02:12:26.360 --> 02:12:31.000]   So it's not just using that money, you know,
[02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:33.040]   it's not just something that you're gonna lose money,
[02:12:33.040 --> 02:12:35.280]   but it's also a public safety risk.
[02:12:35.280 --> 02:12:37.720]   It's also potentially a national security risk.
[02:12:37.720 --> 02:12:40.840]   And so all of those things are super important,
[02:12:40.840 --> 02:12:43.200]   and we wrote about, you know, them, we wrote about
[02:12:43.200 --> 02:12:44.440]   kind of this stuff of, you know,
[02:12:44.440 --> 02:12:46.720]   how you can figure out if maybe your database
[02:12:46.720 --> 02:12:48.080]   is on the black market, right?
[02:12:48.080 --> 02:12:50.760]   On the dark web going in there,
[02:12:50.760 --> 02:12:53.440]   there are ways that you can go in and try to figure out,
[02:12:53.440 --> 02:12:55.560]   like has somebody compromised me
[02:12:55.560 --> 02:12:58.280]   and are they trying to sell our customer data,
[02:12:58.280 --> 02:13:00.480]   you know, on the black market?
[02:13:00.480 --> 02:13:03.440]   There are professional companies.
[02:13:03.440 --> 02:13:07.520]   They have HR departments, they have, you know, benefits,
[02:13:07.520 --> 02:13:09.360]   and they are professional hackers.
[02:13:09.360 --> 02:13:12.120]   They go out and they hack companies,
[02:13:12.120 --> 02:13:14.560]   and then they sell that data now, you know,
[02:13:14.560 --> 02:13:15.760]   on the dark web.
[02:13:15.760 --> 02:13:17.280]   And so because it's big business
[02:13:17.280 --> 02:13:18.640]   and you can make a lot of money on it,
[02:13:18.640 --> 02:13:20.640]   you can make more money selling it on the dark web
[02:13:20.640 --> 02:13:22.880]   than you can actually sell on a bug bounty
[02:13:22.880 --> 02:13:24.360]   to Google and Microsoft,
[02:13:24.360 --> 02:13:26.520]   and that's part of the problem as well.
[02:13:26.520 --> 02:13:30.240]   - We will take that as medicine for the future,
[02:13:30.240 --> 02:13:31.680]   going forward.
[02:13:31.680 --> 02:13:32.760]   Guys, thank you so much.
[02:13:32.760 --> 02:13:34.160]   What a great day,
[02:13:34.160 --> 02:13:35.600]   filling in for Leila Port,
[02:13:35.600 --> 02:13:38.120]   and having the security blankets
[02:13:38.120 --> 02:13:40.760]   of three really great journalists
[02:13:40.760 --> 02:13:42.840]   and thinkers on tech,
[02:13:42.840 --> 02:13:45.760]   and Epic Rantors on tech.
[02:13:45.760 --> 02:13:47.080]   Oh, doctor, thank you so much.
[02:13:47.080 --> 02:13:48.640]   You were amazing today.
[02:13:48.640 --> 02:13:50.680]   The chat room thinks that you were on a just
[02:13:50.680 --> 02:13:53.280]   an incredible rant,
[02:13:53.280 --> 02:13:58.120]   and fiery sort of just talented in your way today
[02:13:58.120 --> 02:13:59.640]   because you're so frustrated because you have to
[02:13:59.640 --> 02:14:01.280]   move house this week.
[02:14:01.280 --> 02:14:02.520]   So that's a big thing.
[02:14:02.520 --> 02:14:04.040]   - It's been a stress week, I haven't asked sleep.
[02:14:04.040 --> 02:14:06.920]   So on Love You, Baggy, Love You,
[02:14:06.920 --> 02:14:08.240]   and Love You, Jason, I love all you guys
[02:14:08.240 --> 02:14:09.120]   'cause you guys are fun.
[02:14:09.120 --> 02:14:10.320]   But the chat room, you know,
[02:14:10.320 --> 02:14:11.160]   I'm in people's channel.
[02:14:11.160 --> 02:14:12.000]   I'm gonna just tell y'all,
[02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:13.000]   if you got kids, we talked about us earlier,
[02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:13.840]   and this is a jet,
[02:14:13.840 --> 02:14:16.000]   and if you're supposed to, if you got a daughter,
[02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:18.240]   Lord help you, get her into science
[02:14:18.240 --> 02:14:20.120]   and tech as early as possible,
[02:14:20.120 --> 02:14:21.680]   and make it fun for the kid,
[02:14:21.680 --> 02:14:23.080]   and show the kid where they could be.
[02:14:23.080 --> 02:14:24.720]   My daughter, her mother's a teacher.
[02:14:24.720 --> 02:14:26.800]   My daughter came to me at five years old.
[02:14:26.800 --> 02:14:28.440]   She said, "Dad, I wanna be a teacher."
[02:14:28.440 --> 02:14:29.560]   I said, "That's cool.
[02:14:29.560 --> 02:14:30.800]   "Teachers don't make any money.
[02:14:30.800 --> 02:14:31.920]   "You wanna be an engineer."
[02:14:31.920 --> 02:14:32.960]   She's like, "But I wanna teach."
[02:14:32.960 --> 02:14:35.200]   I said, "Oh, you gonna teach all the teaching you want."
[02:14:35.200 --> 02:14:36.280]   But you become an engineer,
[02:14:36.280 --> 02:14:38.320]   one of the 30,000 kinds of engineers,
[02:14:38.320 --> 02:14:40.720]   then you go teach engineer and get that professor's degree,
[02:14:40.720 --> 02:14:43.840]   get that 130,000, and then buy me my yacht that I need.
[02:14:43.840 --> 02:14:46.560]   Science and technology for your kids
[02:14:46.560 --> 02:14:47.480]   is the way of the future.
[02:14:47.480 --> 02:14:48.800]   You think your kids are gonna have a job?
[02:14:48.800 --> 02:14:49.640]   They're not gonna have a job.
[02:14:49.640 --> 02:14:50.840]   Not everybody's as charismatic as me
[02:14:50.840 --> 02:14:52.880]   'cause they're talking crap about technology.
[02:14:52.880 --> 02:14:54.400]   Somebody's gotta make the technology,
[02:14:54.400 --> 02:14:55.480]   and that's gonna be your kid,
[02:14:55.480 --> 02:14:56.760]   or they're gonna be out of a job.
[02:14:56.760 --> 02:14:57.840]   We don't make any thing anymore.
[02:14:57.840 --> 02:14:58.720]   It's gonna be robots.
[02:14:58.720 --> 02:15:00.240]   Sometimes got to design a robot,
[02:15:00.240 --> 02:15:01.720]   somebody's got to program robots,
[02:15:01.720 --> 02:15:03.600]   or a gun mechanic got to fix the robots.
[02:15:03.600 --> 02:15:04.880]   That's your future.
[02:15:04.880 --> 02:15:05.840]   Oober, look at Oober.
[02:15:05.840 --> 02:15:07.760]   Oober had all these humans out here doing their work,
[02:15:07.760 --> 02:15:09.640]   and I didn't replace them with robots.
[02:15:09.640 --> 02:15:11.720]   Talk to your kids and set up their future,
[02:15:11.720 --> 02:15:13.440]   and have your kid buy you a yacht.
[02:15:13.440 --> 02:15:15.240]   Care about the kids and technology,
[02:15:15.240 --> 02:15:16.440]   especially if you got to go.
[02:15:16.440 --> 02:15:18.160]   Get these girls and technology and science.
[02:15:18.160 --> 02:15:19.080]   Lord, help me.
[02:15:19.080 --> 02:15:23.080]   - Oh man, unless your child is this fired up as O'Doctor,
[02:15:23.080 --> 02:15:25.040]   you better get them a STEM education.
[02:15:25.040 --> 02:15:25.920]   That's what I'm saying.
[02:15:25.920 --> 02:15:28.240]   - Hey, oh, I'll promote myself.
[02:15:28.240 --> 02:15:31.320]   Icums.com, there's doctails, there's Icums.etex.
[02:15:31.320 --> 02:15:32.240]   There's all kinds of fun stuff.
[02:15:32.240 --> 02:15:33.080]   Go listen to me.
[02:15:33.080 --> 02:15:33.920]   I'm not yawning people.
[02:15:33.920 --> 02:15:35.240]   I apologize for y'all so much.
[02:15:35.240 --> 02:15:36.080]   - He's your best. - Next time,
[02:15:36.080 --> 02:15:37.040]   I will turn it down.
[02:15:37.040 --> 02:15:37.960]   - You are the best.
[02:15:37.960 --> 02:15:38.800]   I love it.
[02:15:38.800 --> 02:15:40.200]   Jason Heiner, where can people find you?
[02:15:40.200 --> 02:15:43.440]   You are such a voice of information reason,
[02:15:43.440 --> 02:15:46.320]   and I really enjoyed watching your yoga retreat
[02:15:46.320 --> 02:15:47.320]   turn into your kitchen.
[02:15:47.320 --> 02:15:48.160]   - Thank you.
[02:15:48.160 --> 02:15:49.000]   Thank you.
[02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:49.840]   I appreciate that.
[02:15:49.840 --> 02:15:51.400]   I appreciate that.
[02:15:51.400 --> 02:15:52.840]   Twitter, I still love Twitter.
[02:15:52.840 --> 02:15:54.440]   As much as I have a time in crap about Twitter,
[02:15:54.440 --> 02:15:56.040]   I still love Twitter.
[02:15:56.040 --> 02:16:00.680]   Come chat at me on Twitter @JasonHeiner.
[02:16:00.680 --> 02:16:02.960]   I check it religiously.
[02:16:02.960 --> 02:16:05.120]   I love having conversations with people on there,
[02:16:05.120 --> 02:16:07.280]   so come check that out.
[02:16:07.280 --> 02:16:10.080]   You can also check out my book, follow thegeeksbook.com.
[02:16:10.080 --> 02:16:12.680]   Thank you for putting that in my lower third.
[02:16:12.680 --> 02:16:15.720]   That's a book that I wrote about 10 really great people
[02:16:15.720 --> 02:16:17.080]   in the tech industry.
[02:16:17.080 --> 02:16:21.280]   And co-wrote with Lindsey Gilpin.
[02:16:21.280 --> 02:16:23.040]   It's a lot of fun.
[02:16:23.040 --> 02:16:24.640]   And yeah, thanks for having me.
[02:16:24.640 --> 02:16:25.680]   I love being here.
[02:16:25.680 --> 02:16:27.120]   I also have a 10 year old daughter.
[02:16:27.120 --> 02:16:30.720]   Her two favorite subjects are math and science,
[02:16:30.720 --> 02:16:35.720]   which is awesome and could agree more that, yeah.
[02:16:35.720 --> 02:16:38.840]   It's like there's a brand problem, right?
[02:16:38.840 --> 02:16:43.640]   For sometimes with girls and women with tech
[02:16:43.640 --> 02:16:45.720]   is not seen it as a very friendly place.
[02:16:45.720 --> 02:16:49.360]   And so it is our responsibility to change that.
[02:16:49.360 --> 02:16:52.640]   And something that we should all take really, really seriously.
[02:16:52.640 --> 02:16:56.280]   Good dads doing good work and good role models
[02:16:56.280 --> 02:16:58.720]   over here, Christine Warren at Gizmodo.
[02:16:58.720 --> 02:17:01.800]   Thank you so much for all your insight and knowledge.
[02:17:01.800 --> 02:17:03.480]   Where can people find your work?
[02:17:03.480 --> 02:17:05.160]   - Yeah, so you can find me at gizmodo.com

[02:17:09.440 --> 02:17:10.440]   with some of their business decisions,
[02:17:10.440 --> 02:17:11.280]   I still love Twitter.
