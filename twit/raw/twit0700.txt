[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:55.200]   Tech news and we have a great panel for you. We haven't seen you in about six months.
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.800]   Glad to welcome back Alex Wilhelm. It's good to be here.
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.280]   Editor in chief of the Crunchbase News site.
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.120]   That's good. And I'm not wearing a branded T-shirt this week because I forgot to.
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.680]   So you look really good. I think married life is good for you.
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.800]   Engaged life. When is the wedding? June.
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.880]   Exciting. It's coming up at last. It's been.
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:17.520]   Congratulations.
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.560]   Impending for some time.
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.320]   Some people who've watched for a long time might remember we met Alex's fiance,
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.760]   Liza, who is going to be a psychiatrist. So that's appropriate.
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.000]   Yeah, it's actually kind of for you to save a fortune.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.120]   You marry what you need.
[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.160]   Phil, she's a doll. She's wonderful.
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.960]   And lives in my childhood home, which is bizarre, but true.
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.160]   Can you just leave it at least, right?
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.760]   Now, if you go to the top floor, there's loose skirting behind that.
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.120]   Alex has promised to make a video because I'm going to make a video and to show you what we've
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.840]   changed and improved.
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:46.400]   I want to see what's different.
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.560]   Yeah.
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.040]   So it was there that in 1969, I watched Neil Armstrong step on the moon.
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.200]   It's also there that I recently hit my head on the side of the wall.
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.040]   You know, I mean, every home has memories.
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.520]   No, no.
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.840]   Okay.
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.400]   That was a British fellow by his name of Ian Thompson.
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.120]   He is from the register.co.uk where he's a news editor.
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.080]   It's great to see you Ian.
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.880]   Oh, it was good fun.
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:05.680]   Happy New Year.
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.080]   Happy New Year to you also, compliments of the season.
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.200]   I'm hoping many English breakfasts for you in the year.
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.000]   Oh, well, yes.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.200]   I had good thick British bacon and eggs for breakfast this morning,
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.680]   so I'm quite happy and reasonably content.
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:18.400]   And drowsy.
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.480]   Also here.
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:26.240]   Hey, we welcome him back from his Gastronomad experience in Mexico City, Mike Elgin.
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.960]   Yes.
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:28.960]   So how was that the Mexico City experience?
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.080]   It was New Year's Eve.
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.880]   Unbelievable.
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:31.520]   It was great.
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.480]   We did New Year's Eve on a rooftop overlooking Zocalo Square.
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:35.280]   Oh, fun.
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.280]   And it was just like fantastic.
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.240]   It was great.
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.960]   It was really, really nice.
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:39.680]   So jealous.
[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.920]   Anyway, we have gathered together to mourn the passing of Apple computers.
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.240]   Again.
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.720]   Again.
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:47.280]   Oh.
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.120]   Man, there was a lot of Schadenfreude.
[00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.360]   Schadenfreude was thick in the air this week.
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.880]   When Wednesday, Apple's Tim Cook issued a letter saying,
[00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.680]   "I'm sorry, but you know, we said we were going to have $92 billion in
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:00.480]   revenue.
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.400]   It's only going to be $84 billion in revenue."
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.000]   Gun from being a huge cash machine to a slightly smaller cash machine.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.280]   It did hurt their stock price.
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.840]   They were a trillion dollar company in August.
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:17.200]   Market cap, the last time I checked, $700 billion.
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.760]   Which is a lot different.
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.600]   Only the fourth largest company in the world.
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.520]   You covered this stuff for Crunchbase.
[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.840]   Yeah.
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.240]   I think that there's some, and everybody, including, of course,
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.040]   John Gruber, and it's funny coming out of retirement
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.560]   because he couldn't resist it.
[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.760]   MJ Seagler had to cover this.
[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.120]   And what the letter meant.
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.880]   They parsed it line by line.
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.960]   But give us the overview, Alex.
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.440]   Well, for a long time, Apple has done a fantastic job
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.360]   that maintaining increased profitability,
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.560]   despite seeing its kind of unit volume numbers stop to grow.
[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.640]   And they did that by pushing up ASPs or average selling prices across their device lines.
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.120]   And expanding into new territories like China.
[00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.520]   Exactly.
[00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.600]   And then all that stopped working all of a sudden.
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.120]   They had a problem with the Chinese market.
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.640]   They didn't see as many upgrades as they thought they were going to.
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.800]   So revenue will be far lower than expected.
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.080]   Apple will still make a ton of money.
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.720]   They still have almost a quarter trillion in cash.
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.080]   So the company's not going anywhere,
[00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.080]   but everyone's now quite concerned about growth.
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.680]   And the bigger story here that kind of fits on top of the Apple bit
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.200]   is that in China, it's loading down for Apple.
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:20.800]   What does that mean for other brands?
[00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.760]   They sell into the market, luxury brands, other electronics brands.
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.400]   And also, what does it mean for the global macro economic situation?
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.680]   So there's an Apple story, a China story, and a broader economic story.
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.560]   But Apple's not only worth, I just looked $703.6 billion.
[00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:35.840]   So they're definitely doomed.
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.400]   No doubt.
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.960]   There's an even bigger, bigger story, which is that,
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:47.520]   since Apple has been driven by iPhones, profits, sales revenue, etc.,
[00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.280]   there was always going to be a plateau and a decline of some kind.
[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:52.960]   Because there's only so many people,
[00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.280]   only so many people are going to pay for premium phones.
[00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.800]   And a lot of people are snidely saying,
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.000]   "Oh, the whole reason is that phones are too expensive.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.200]   Just lower the price of the phones."
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:04.080]   That's not going to do it either.
[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.240]   That's not going to help the revenue, certainly.
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.360]   And so I've been talking about this for a couple of years.
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.480]   This was going to happen.
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:11.040]   It's going to happen.
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:11.600]   There's no way around.
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:15.840]   This is why I've been predicting big, new businesses like the self-driving car.
[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:20.160]   Maybe they need to make Apple Pay cross-platform, something like that.
[00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.200]   They have to do something because phones aren't going to take them into the future
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:23.920]   on the same trajectory.
[00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:26.640]   Apple hasn't created a significant new product since the iPad.
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:28.640]   There's this thing.
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:29.200]   The iPad thing.
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:30.560]   A pair of headphones.
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:31.520]   The AirPods.
[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:32.960]   Oh, come on. The watch.
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.000]   It's a toy.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.720]   How much of Apple's revenue is watch-based?
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.560]   5%, 4%, 3%.
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:38.960]   I mean, the single-
[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:40.400]   Less AirPods-based.
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.240]   That's two parts.
[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.480]   Well, I bought three because I keep losing it.
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:48.800]   But partly that's because it's dwarfed by the success of the iPhone.
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:52.080]   I mean, really, this is a problem every company would love to have,
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:56.480]   which is such a massively successful single product that powers revenue for years,
[00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:58.240]   makes you a hugely valuable company.
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:02.080]   And it's always a problem because then you need a successor, a follow-up.
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:04.880]   And Apple actually has had a number of lives.
[00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:09.680]   I mean, if you think about it, they've had the Apple II and then the Mac was a failure,
[00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:10.800]   but at least it was a failure.
[00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:13.920]   But the Mac was a failure, then they managed to make the Mac a success.
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:17.760]   Then the iPod in the early 2000s, that was a huge success.
[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:17.920]   Yeah.
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:21.040]   So they have managed year after year to come up with a hit,
[00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:23.360]   but it has been a long time since they've come up with it.
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:28.080]   And partly that's because there's been nothing ever in the world as successful as the iPhone.
[00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:30.400]   Well, the talk is they're going to move to services.
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:31.920]   And then Apple's going to stop selling-
[00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:31.920]   That's what Steve-
[00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:33.360]   That's what Chris Unibon said.
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:33.920]   Steve Cook said.
[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:34.240]   Yeah.
[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:37.760]   Well, Steve Cook is probably a good guy to ask about what Apple will do.
[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:40.000]   So the question is, how can they make that transition?
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.640]   Because they're not going to win the productivity wars.
[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:45.680]   You've got Google and Microsoft, they're really budding heads.
[00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:48.400]   They're not going to win the cloud storage wars or the cloud computing wars.
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:50.400]   So where are they going to find a home in services?
[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:52.960]   They can really expect a lot of long-term revenue growth,
[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:57.040]   especially at a time in which App Store revenue cuts are under attack.
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:59.200]   The Fortnite App Store is going to take 12%.
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:00.160]   Apple wants 30.
[00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:00.960]   If he was an arcade-
[00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:00.960]   Right.
[00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:03.440]   Microsoft has already said they're willing to go down to 85.
[00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:05.840]   They're willing to take 15% from some developers as well.
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:06.160]   Brilliant.
[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:07.360]   Microsoft makes money otherwise.
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:09.280]   Apple needs that revenue scheme to keep growing.
[00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.520]   So I don't know what's going to happen with them in the short term.
[00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:13.920]   It puts them a little bit of a bite if they're going to rely on services.
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:16.800]   And self-driving cars, augmented reality,
[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.480]   some of the other things Apple's talked about aren't-
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:19.040]   These are fine.
[00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:21.040]   We're near five-year down the line projects.
[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:21.520]   Yeah.
[00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:23.680]   When they're not even close to being ready yet.
[00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:27.280]   And in the meantime, they've said in their last quarterly financial results,
[00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:31.360]   yeah, we're not actually going to report on unit ships anymore just on revenues,
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:33.360]   which was basically a sign that,
[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:36.720]   yeah, we're just going to be relying on jacking up the price and profit-taking.
[00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:37.440]   And the-
[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:44.000]   Another way spinning is saying that the unit sales are not really what's driving
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.040]   income going forward.
[00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:45.920]   They're flat.
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:49.520]   What we're going to take a look at is how much money we make per customer.
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:51.840]   And that's a- I think that's not an unreasonable thing to do.
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:52.880]   A lot of companies do it at.
[00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:54.560]   Microsoft doesn't break down unit sales.
[00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:55.920]   Google doesn't break down unit sales.
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:59.760]   It is maybe, especially in this new world for Apple,
[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:01.920]   more appropriate to look at revenue per customer.
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:03.440]   Well-
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.200]   But look, we knew Apple was going to-
[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:10.160]   I have to say, a lot of this is just Sean Freud.
[00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:13.920]   Oh, a trillion dollar company A will show you-
[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:14.720]   A-
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:15.440]   We're not-
[00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:16.080]   That's what we do.
[00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:17.920]   We build people up to knock them down.
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:19.040]   That's kind of the way it is.
[00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:21.840]   I mean, we're not going to solve human nature on this show.
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:22.080]   No.
[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:23.040]   We can at least understand it.
[00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:23.920]   We can try.
[00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:24.400]   We can try.
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:25.600]   It is part of it.
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:26.880]   I do have a philosophy degree.
[00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:27.840]   So there's a legitimate-
[00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:29.440]   So you were right.
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:30.960]   Celebrate.
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:32.400]   Take a victory lap, Mike Elgin.
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:34.000]   Apple's been-
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.320]   Was been facing this problem for a couple of years,
[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:38.400]   and they have yet to come up with a successor.
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:40.800]   I've heard people say this is Tim Cook's fault.
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:42.080]   He shouldn't-
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:42.640]   He didn't-
[00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:44.160]   He hasn't come up with a follow-up.
[00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:46.160]   You even kind of implied that because-
[00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:48.880]   Well, I mean, okay, he's not quite scully levels at bad.
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:52.080]   He's very good at keeping the business running and-
[00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:53.920]   And making it profitable.
[00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:57.280]   No, he's a great operations guy, but he's not an innovations guy.
[00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:59.280]   And Johnny I appears to have basically given up.
[00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:00.080]   I think he's retired.
[00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:00.400]   Yeah.
[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:01.440]   Sammy retired now.
[00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:03.200]   Well, it's you cashing checks as a full-time job.
[00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:04.160]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:05.280]   This is the innovators dilemma.
[00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:07.760]   This is the classic dilemma for all companies,
[00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:09.520]   especially tech companies.
[00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:13.120]   It's hard to reinvent yourself many times, and Apple's done it.
[00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:15.280]   But Apple's done it more than most.
[00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:15.920]   More than most.
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:19.520]   Well, one thing we should all look inside ourselves and question is whether-
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:22.080]   How invested are we in the success of this corporation?
[00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:24.000]   I mean, yes, they're iconic.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.240]   Yes, Steve Jobs' career was amazing.
[00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:28.000]   Yes, they've impressed us.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.600]   Yes, we've all been Apple fans at some point or another, but it's a corporation.
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:32.960]   Come on, why is it-
[00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:33.920]   That's the problem though.
[00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:37.200]   I think a lot of Apple fans really do have an investment.
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:37.760]   It's about identity.
[00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:38.320]   It's about identity.
[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:39.360]   It's about identity.
[00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:41.280]   And Apple's been good at capitalizing our lives,
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:42.400]   but there's a number of brand-
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:43.840]   And a fashion brand.
[00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:47.680]   There's a limited number of people with both the passion and the money to pay the
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:50.320]   cupidini, idiot tax again and again and again.
[00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:51.440]   Hey, I do love your bill.
[00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:53.120]   Calm down, stop calling me an idiot on air.
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:57.520]   Well, I just bought a Pixel 3, a Mufa iPhone to the Pixel 3,
[00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:02.400]   and Google's selling a fraction of the Pixel phones that Apple is selling iPhones.
[00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:04.080]   They're probably losing money on it.
[00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:04.960]   It's still a great phone.
[00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:07.680]   Apple sells more phones than a month than Google sold all year.
[00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:08.160]   Yeah.
[00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:11.200]   But one thing that's caught my eye during this entire Bruha Ha-ha
[00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:13.280]   was how we're behind talking about this now.
[00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:15.920]   If you look at global smartphone shipments over the last couple of years,
[00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:16.880]   they've been flat.
[00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:17.360]   This is not coming.
[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:18.560]   We should have been expecting this.
[00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:19.200]   We were.
[00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:20.080]   Well, we all were.
[00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:22.000]   I mean, but I don't think we're saying this for years.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   So I've been saying it for years.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.200]   It feels sudden.
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:27.920]   I don't think we're shocked that there was a plot to the smartphone sales.
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:29.360]   There's a limited number of people who can afford them.
[00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:34.000]   But I feel like this conversation wasn't as concrete as it should have been.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   We should have been more honest about this.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.280]   But I mean, one problem that we have is that the old iPhones are so damn good.
[00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:40.880]   Sorry, I apologize, everyone.
[00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:43.600]   Like my 7 Plus that I still have, I'm going to keep it till it dies.
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:45.200]   Because why would I ever change it?
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:45.760]   Took advantage.
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:48.080]   This is one of the factors Tim Cook mentioned in his letter.
[00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:50.000]   Took advantage of the battery replacement.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:50.640]   Yeah.
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:52.000]   $29.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.480]   He said we got more people than we thought would do that.
[00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:56.160]   And those people did not upgrade.
[00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:59.200]   She calls her iPhone 6 her beloved iPhone 6.
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:11:59.600]   Oh.
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:00.640]   Does not want to change it.
[00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:02.560]   She likes having a headphone jack.
[00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:02.960]   Exactly.
[00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:05.840]   The new battery made it as fast as it, you know, as it ever was.
[00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:06.560]   Yeah.
[00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:07.040]   Yeah.
[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:08.560]   This is the iPad problem that they've had.
[00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:10.480]   The iPads are so durable and long lasting.
[00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:11.360]   It's like, who needs a new one?
[00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:12.960]   It's really not that different.
[00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:17.200]   And with that battery replacement, it was so inexpensive, it's such a no-brainer.
[00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:21.440]   It kind of turned iPhones into iPads because that battery was the thing that started killing
[00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:22.320]   you after a couple of years.
[00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:22.960]   Right.
[00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:25.680]   And that does raise the issue if Apple did that on purpose.
[00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:27.200]   Because Apple was slowing down phones.
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:30.000]   They got caught, but they were slowing down phones with older batteries.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.480]   But here again is an unmitigated benefit to consumers and the environment.
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:36.880]   Because there are fewer phones that are manufactured.
[00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:37.840]   The better it is for them.
[00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:38.800]   These are not recycled.
[00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:39.840]   Less sea waste on the rest of it.
[00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:44.160]   So this battery thing is a good thing for Apple to lose money on it and have trouble
[00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:46.000]   partly because of that.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:46.960]   So what?
[00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:46.960]   So what?
[00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:47.200]   Yeah.
[00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:47.840]   It's a good thing for Apple.
[00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:50.800]   It's a good thing if Apple becomes, say, IBM in a decade.
[00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:51.200]   So what?
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:52.160]   So what?
[00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:53.920]   It's still a massive money-making machine.
[00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:54.400]   Yeah.
[00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:59.120]   You know, but at the same time, as you say, people are replacing their battery.
[00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:02.880]   And also, Tim cooked blame China a little bit on this.
[00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:03.840]   I was kind of skeptical.
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:05.760]   And then I talked to friends out there.
[00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:10.160]   And Apple is now becoming, in fact, buying any American technology in China is almost
[00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:11.920]   seen as disloyal in some circles.
[00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:11.920]   Yeah.
[00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:13.120]   This is the new backlash.
[00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:13.440]   Yeah.
[00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:16.880]   Remember, in fact, this happened New Year's Eve.
[00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:22.560]   The Huawei PR team that tweeted New Year's greetings not from a Huawei phone, but from an iPhone.
[00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:22.880]   Yeah.
[00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:23.920]   And got busted.
[00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:26.640]   And two employees got demoted because of it.
[00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:29.360]   Because it's seen as disloyal.
[00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:30.080]   Yeah.
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:32.560]   It's not merely, you know, your company's mad at you.
[00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:35.840]   The Chinese people thought of it as disloyal.
[00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:38.000]   And you were saying, "We're coming up to peak smartphone."
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.160]   Huawei released that letter.
[00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:44.080]   And they're saying, "No, we're expecting 30% increase in smartphone sales because they're not
[00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:45.440]   hyper expensive."
[00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:50.720]   Well, partly what's eating Apple's lunch is very inexpensive, but very high quality Chinese
[00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:50.960]   make phones.
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:55.200]   If you're going to pay half the cost and get 90% of the functionality, it's a no-brainer.
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:56.880]   No one needs face ID, really.
[00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:58.960]   No one needs emojis.
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:13:59.520]   No one needs-
[00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:00.960]   I don't have any of those.
[00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:02.080]   I've never missed them once.
[00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:02.720]   Yeah.
[00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:03.600]   Maybe I'm getting older.
[00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:04.560]   Do you miss them?
[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:06.160]   Mike, you switched to it, Android.
[00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:07.760]   And no, none of those things.
[00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:10.080]   I'm so happy.
[00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:12.720]   Never received em emoji text from you, actually.
[00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:13.760]   Yeah, you're not going to.
[00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:17.200]   I was talking to my mom and I did turn down the emoji of my face.
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:19.760]   She says, "Stop it. What are you doing? Stop that.
[00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:22.320]   Why are you talking pile of fusi?
[00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:22.960]   Yeah, what?
[00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:23.520]   Oh my gosh.
[00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:25.440]   That looks like poop.
[00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:28.000]   She said, "Stop it."
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.120]   So-
[00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:29.600]   No, I mean, it's-
[00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:30.000]   Innovation.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:30.400]   Innovation.
[00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:31.360]   Innovation.
[00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:32.400]   It's courage.
[00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:34.000]   What they've added is, yes, courage.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.280]   They're the courage in making you buy dongles that you immediately lose.
[00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:39.600]   And it's gimmicks like face ID.
[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:41.360]   So there is, especially among people like you,
[00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:46.400]   a certain amount of joy in this announcement that Apple's not going to be-
[00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:47.360]   Joy is-
[00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:49.120]   Joy is just like-
[00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:50.160]   Shiden Freud's the right word.
[00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:51.760]   A sort of finally-
[00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:52.880]   They're getting the message.
[00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:53.280]   Finally.
[00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:57.200]   I mean, this is probably an unpopular opinion,
[00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:01.920]   but I think that all of the success of Apple is due to one person, Steve Jobs.
[00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:02.560]   Yeah.
[00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:03.520]   I mean, it-
[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:05.520]   We're just posting after the post-DeeJobs-
[00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:06.240]   I think there's evidence.
[00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:07.200]   I think it was so good.
[00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:09.360]   Was Steve Jobs's other than the building,
[00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:10.400]   which is also amazing,
[00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:12.160]   that the circular spaceship building.
[00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:15.280]   The iPhone, maybe argue with the iPad,
[00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:19.680]   but the iPhone was his last genius move to go into a whole-
[00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:22.640]   I was critical of it back in 2000, whatever.
[00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:23.440]   Seven.
[00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:24.720]   It was well before that.
[00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:25.680]   I was critical and said,
[00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:26.320]   "Oh, come on.
[00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:28.720]   This is the worst business you don't want to-
[00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:29.520]   I see the same thing.
[00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:30.480]   You don't want to get in that business.
[00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:30.960]   Exactly.
[00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:32.080]   It's a disaster.
[00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:33.440]   What a catastrophe.
[00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:35.440]   And to be fair, the first iPhone was a real dog,
[00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:36.640]   apart from the user interface.
[00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:40.560]   The vision of it all and the execution of it all over time was just-
[00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:41.040]   Absolutely perfect.
[00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:42.000]   Obviously killer.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:42.320]   Perfect.
[00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:42.800]   Yeah.
[00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:45.120]   I want to talk about the Schadenfreude thing, though.
[00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:45.840]   I don't think people-
[00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:47.680]   That is a German word for those who don't know.
[00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:50.960]   That means the shameful joy at the misfortune of others.
[00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:52.000]   Except for the shame part.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   The thing about that is I don't take any joy at a company doing poorly.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.560]   I don't particularly care if Microsoft is better than Apple.
[00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:03.840]   What I do want to point out and cop to is that
[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:06.880]   Apple fanboys being sad is fine by me.
[00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:08.720]   That probably makes me a little bit of joy.
[00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:11.680]   Because they've been baying this drum forever
[00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:13.840]   about how Apple's better than everyone else, even though it's not.
[00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:15.440]   It's great, but other companies are good too.
[00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:17.680]   And to see this happen is a bit of like CUC.
[00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:20.560]   They're mortal over one Apple way or whatever.
[00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:22.720]   Because there's just people at a corporation.
[00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:24.480]   So the fanboys drive me nuts.
[00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:25.840]   Apple I don't particularly care about.
[00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:27.200]   I'll use whatever PC is best.
[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:30.320]   Currently it's a Windows 10 gaming rig in this MacBook Pro.
[00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:31.200]   That's all I need.
[00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:33.600]   But I don't care more than that just the people driving nuts.
[00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:36.000]   What's the German word for shameless joy?
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.520]   The shameless joy.
[00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:38.960]   I just looked up Schadenfreude.
[00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:41.600]   There is an English word that means the same thing,
[00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:43.680]   which is unusual because a lot of German words,
[00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:45.280]   there's no translation.
[00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:46.560]   It's epicaracy.
[00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:48.720]   That's not quite as fun.
[00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:49.760]   Epicaracy.
[00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:50.560]   I've never heard it.
[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:51.360]   Keric.
[00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:52.000]   Epicaracy.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:57.200]   It comes from the Greek epi upon Cara, joy, and Caccon evil.
[00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:58.240]   I don't see that catching on.
[00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:00.560]   I do not even stick with the German on this.
[00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:02.960]   I don't even want to make that the title of the Twitter episode.
[00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:03.760]   There's no more memory.
[00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:04.640]   Epicaracy.
[00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:09.440]   You see one of my favorite German words is back flenchinch,
[00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:13.920]   which is used to describe a face that should be slapped.
[00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:16.320]   Every time I see you.
[00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:16.960]   I've got one of those.
[00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:17.600]   Yeah.
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:20.400]   Every time I see Hugh Thompson at the RSA conference,
[00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:22.880]   it's just like, yeah, that's a face made for punching.
[00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:23.360]   Yes.
[00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:24.080]   It's just.
[00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:25.920]   I think you mispronounced it, but I don't know.
[00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:27.440]   Yeah, I've got a lot of syllabs.
[00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:32.080]   Yeah, I mean, they were first in the queue when it came to the syllables for that one.
[00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:33.120]   Yes.
[00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:36.320]   So, look, that's fine.
[00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:38.240]   We're an interesting situation right now, though.
[00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:42.480]   I think in technology where it looks like, and maybe this is always the case,
[00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:45.120]   because just as fish aren't aware of the water,
[00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:48.800]   we're not aware of our limited scope.
[00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:52.320]   It looks like companies like Google and Facebook
[00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:55.440]   have gotten the point where they can't fail.
[00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:56.400]   They can't wear out.
[00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:57.120]   They can't.
[00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:59.760]   There's no business cycle applicable to them.
[00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:00.160]   I don't know.
[00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:03.920]   I think they're in both of those cases, you're looking at firm.
[00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:05.440]   The history would tell you that.
[00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:08.080]   They're into the gradual decline.
[00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:09.280]   You know, this is sort of into the nursing home.
[00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:11.840]   But there's not going to be another Google coming along.
[00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:13.280]   There's search engine coming along.
[00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:15.920]   There's not going to be another Facebook coming.
[00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:19.840]   Just as Facebook destroyed my space, nobody's going to come along and destroy Facebook.
[00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:21.360]   Or is I'm trying, personally.
[00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:22.160]   I disagree.
[00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:23.520]   I don't know.
[00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:25.760]   You probably don't know this because you're not on Facebook.
[00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:30.400]   But I'm quitting Facebook slowly.
[00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:32.560]   In July, I'm quitting.
[00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:33.840]   That's called not quitting.
[00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:34.480]   Yeah.
[00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:36.080]   No, that was drinking for ages.
[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:36.480]   Yeah.
[00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:38.000]   I'm still working on it.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.960]   No, but it's like Walt Mossberg, four days after I wrote this big post about
[00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:45.920]   why I'm doing it, said, "I don't want to convince anybody else."
[00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:46.720]   He quit.
[00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:47.200]   He did.
[00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:49.840]   But I want to convince everyone to get off Facebook, Instagram,
[00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:52.320]   WhatsApp, and Messenger.
[00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:54.400]   Because they're just horrible.
[00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:55.200]   I know you've done it.
[00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:56.320]   I tried to--
[00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:59.120]   So I bought the Facebook portal devices.
[00:18:59.120 --> 00:18:59.920]   You were the one.
[00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:00.240]   Yeah.
[00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:00.880]   I was the one.
[00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:02.800]   No, because I had to--
[00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:04.480]   I thought, well, it's good to review it anyway.
[00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:04.880]   They're not good.
[00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:05.520]   Actually, they weren't talking about--
[00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:06.400]   They weren't going to sales either.
[00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:09.840]   If they weren't tied to Facebook, I think they'd be pretty remarkable.
[00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:13.040]   The problem is I can't get my money back.
[00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:16.880]   I've written to them.
[00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:18.320]   They said 30-day money back.
[00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:20.160]   That 30 days has passed.
[00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:20.880]   I wrote to them.
[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:21.840]   They said, "Okay, fine.
[00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:23.520]   Why do you want to get rid of it?
[00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:25.200]   Is it because I don't like you or something?"
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:27.600]   And I sent them the invoice.
[00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:28.560]   I said, "We need to see your order."
[00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:28.880]   I sent them.
[00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:30.480]   And then I never heard from them again.
[00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:33.440]   And now I realize it's because I don't have a Facebook account.
[00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:34.800]   I am a caught in some year.
[00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:35.680]   That is not--
[00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:38.000]   They have a shadow profile on you that's a mile long.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:38.480]   I know.
[00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:39.440]   They know who I am.
[00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:40.800]   They know where you are right now.
[00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:41.360]   Yeah.
[00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:43.760]   So why can't I get my money back?
[00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:44.640]   Because they don't want to.
[00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:45.440]   No.
[00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:47.280]   They don't have to hold a pair of them,
[00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:48.480]   and we're not giving you your money back.
[00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:50.960]   It's a lot more profitable than just to put you through.
[00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:52.800]   And anybody wants a Facebook--
[00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:54.320]   It's so good to me because I don't have a Facebook.
[00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:55.680]   Suddenly they have no data on you.
[00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:56.720]   But you see, I think you're the only person
[00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:57.760]   that I have a lot of data on.
[00:19:57.760 --> 00:19:58.400]   I think Facebook--
[00:19:58.400 --> 00:19:59.760]   All of a sudden they can't find you.
[00:19:59.760 --> 00:19:59.760]   Yeah.
[00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:01.280]   I don't know who this guy is.
[00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:01.680]   Who are you?
[00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:02.800]   You're not on Facebook.
[00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:05.920]   Can I touch on why Google could struggle?
[00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:07.360]   If not fail, but struggle.
[00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:09.280]   And one thing that people don't keep tabs on is
[00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:11.200]   every quarter of Google reports earnings
[00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:12.960]   and they show off two numbers that are very important.
[00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:15.920]   One is the number of paid clicks they've had.
[00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:16.960]   Always goes up.
[00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:19.440]   And they also show the cost per click for those payments
[00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:22.640]   goes down because they're driving more mobile clicks
[00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:25.120]   from search over time, which is good for them.
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:26.800]   But they're worth less per click.
[00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:28.880]   And so eventually they'll come a day in which the price
[00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:29.920]   per click goes down still.
[00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:31.760]   They should pay you if you click something.
[00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:32.240]   Maybe.
[00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:33.520]   That's Tabula, I think.
[00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:34.960]   That works.
[00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:36.720]   But there's a time which these curves no longer work
[00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:38.960]   in Google's favor and does actually generate revenue growth.
[00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:41.280]   At that point in time they'll be where Apple is now still
[00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:43.120]   hugely profitable, still doing very well.
[00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:44.640]   But not the same engine that they were before.
[00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:46.160]   And that's going to change the corporate culture,
[00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:47.440]   how they push product development.
[00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:49.600]   So I have a very simplistic point of view,
[00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:52.560]   which is, well, nobody can duplicate their search engine.
[00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:54.240]   But you're making a very accurate point,
[00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:55.680]   which that's not their revenue source.
[00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:57.520]   The revenue source is paid clicks.
[00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:59.040]   Paid clicks.
[00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:01.440]   And of course, I think Google realizes it because there's
[00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:04.080]   a frenzied search for the next big thing at Google.
[00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:06.080]   I mean, that's clearly a big deal for them.
[00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:09.600]   Nest, verily, the cloud thingy, the drug,
[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:10.080]   what is it?
[00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:11.280]   All of that structure.
[00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:11.920]   Right.
[00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:12.400]   Yeah.
[00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:15.200]   But you see, I think Facebook's problem is that it won't,
[00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:17.200]   you know, get overtaken immediately,
[00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:19.840]   but it's being cut off from both the bottom of the top.
[00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:22.400]   Younger people aren't going to Facebook.
[00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:25.360]   They're actively deleting their accounts.
[00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:26.640]   And okay, they're going to Instagram,
[00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:27.920]   which Facebook happens to own,
[00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:29.600]   but that's not going to work anymore
[00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:32.320]   because Facebook isn't going to be allowed to buy up the competition
[00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:33.600]   in the same way that it used to.
[00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:34.480]   They're not?
[00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:34.720]   No.
[00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:35.520]   Who's going to stop them?
[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:36.800]   The regulators.
[00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:40.080]   Facebook has pissed off so many people in Congress at the moment.
[00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:40.560]   That's true.
[00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:43.040]   I think they should have tested very tough time.
[00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:45.760]   Facebook buys stuff until Facebook starts writing chats.
[00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:47.200]   Yeah, I'm not sure that there is that.
[00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:48.400]   Wait, wait, tell us.
[00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:48.800]   Oh, sorry.
[00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:50.480]   But also the upper end of the scale.
[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:51.760]   And this is something I noticed because
[00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:55.360]   my parents were on Facebook and my parents were on Facebook.
[00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:57.600]   Well, you use it to be in touch with people in the UK.
[00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:00.720]   Which I do, but I'm seeing a lot of the older generation
[00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:03.520]   with the privacy stuff that's been coming out now.
[00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:05.200]   I kind of like, you know what?
[00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:08.720]   I was fine with just email and downgrading their accounts.
[00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:10.640]   The app in particular,
[00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:13.520]   my mum took the app off her phone
[00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:16.800]   and a bunch of her friends did because they were worried that it was listening to them.
[00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:18.000]   So I heard that aware.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:18.960]   I told them it didn't happen, but...
[00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:20.400]   No, no, actually...
[00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:22.640]   They might have been listening to them,
[00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:24.560]   but we're now seeing a number of stories that even...
[00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:25.840]   Oh, there's data correlation.
[00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:27.440]   Yeah, the...
[00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:29.520]   These shadow profiles are very real.
[00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:30.160]   They're very real.
[00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:33.040]   Data correlation is not something I want to have happen on my phone
[00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:34.480]   with all my permission, I feel.
[00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:35.840]   But I agree this entirely.
[00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:37.040]   I get it off.
[00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:37.440]   That's interesting.
[00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:38.720]   They're that aware.
[00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:40.080]   Is that because of you?
[00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:41.600]   They do read my copy, yes.
[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:42.960]   So I don't know if every...
[00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:45.200]   Maybe a new year old is doing it.
[00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:47.520]   I mean, a lot of...
[00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:48.400]   They said themselves.
[00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:50.720]   They've had a massive number of people deleting the app.
[00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:52.480]   And that's really going to hurt them long term.
[00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:56.000]   And I have an alternative, but why don't you go first and then...
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.800]   Oh, I was just going to say my mum is the most active Facebook user in my family,
[00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:00.560]   and she's the least tech savvy.
[00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:02.960]   So I mean, that's not the demographic you want.
[00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:05.040]   If you want a cool product that will persist long term.
[00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:09.280]   Well, but if what you want is to sell advertising,
[00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:12.560]   there is a case to be made for a less tech savvy audience.
[00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:17.600]   I was told at tech TV that we don't want tech savvy people
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:20.240]   because they don't buy brands.
[00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:23.440]   They search for the best product at the best price.
[00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:24.160]   You know what that...
[00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:24.480]   No.
[00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:25.440]   You know.
[00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:28.000]   Give me an impulse bar.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:28.720]   And in fact...
[00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:29.200]   Yeah.
[00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:31.280]   Honestly, I don't know about Facebook,
[00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:34.960]   but Instagram, one of the reasons I got off is because I made so many impulse buys on Instagram.
[00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:35.440]   Yeah.
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:36.160]   You do buy stuff.
[00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:37.120]   I bought Instagram.
[00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:38.640]   Underwear, I bought Instagram.
[00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:39.120]   Everything.
[00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:40.320]   Their advertising is amazing.
[00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:40.800]   It's so active.
[00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:41.280]   It works.
[00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:42.800]   They know exactly what I want.
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:43.600]   It's like...
[00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:44.640]   So honestly...
[00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:46.560]   See, I make a point if I see an advert on Facebook,
[00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:48.960]   I deliberately don't buy it via Facebook.
[00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:50.240]   It's just like me being bloody minded.
[00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:51.600]   That's why they don't like people like you.
[00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:52.240]   Yeah.
[00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:53.280]   That's the whole problem.
[00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:53.920]   Well, there is a...
[00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:55.040]   I don't know if there's a term for it,
[00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:58.080]   but there is a thing called banner blindness.
[00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:00.240]   I was just reading about this,
[00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:02.320]   where people just don't see banner ads.
[00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:03.760]   I know, I don't see banner ads.
[00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:07.120]   And I think that it's almost like you a willful desire,
[00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:10.480]   which is a shame because I'm in an ad supported business.
[00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:11.840]   Well, a willful desire.
[00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:12.080]   No, no.
[00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:12.720]   I was a high-up.
[00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:12.880]   I was a high-up.
[00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:14.160]   It was the advertisers, right?
[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:17.600]   But yeah, I mean, I think there is a kickback against it,
[00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:19.920]   and particularly when people get more and more creeped out
[00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:21.840]   by, as you say, the shadow profiles
[00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:23.680]   and the amount of targeting that goes on,
[00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:25.920]   I think that generally does creep a lot of people out,
[00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:28.720]   and it will come round and hurt them in the end.
[00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:31.760]   What I'm fascinated by is the fact that people think
[00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:35.040]   that it's impossible to replicate Facebook's reach,
[00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:36.720]   which it is not, actually.
[00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:40.800]   I've created this idea called the NiceBook,
[00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:41.680]   which is a Google...
[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:43.200]   It's simply a shared folder of Google.
[00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:44.240]   Is it on Google+?
[00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:45.040]   It's Google Photos.
[00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:45.600]   OK.
[00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:46.400]   Close.
[00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:47.920]   Plus, this thing still exists.
[00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:51.040]   I have to say, when Google+...
[00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:53.040]   If you don't know, it's a huge Google+ one.
[00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:55.360]   When they kill Google+, I have to think of you in a society.
[00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:55.840]   First person I thought.
[00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:57.440]   Mike is going to be punching a wall right now.
[00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:59.200]   You can have the Apple people when they find out
[00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:00.560]   that Tim Cook's letter to the news.
[00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:02.560]   So, use Google Photos as a social network?
[00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:05.840]   I have a single folder called Mike Elgin's NiceBook.
[00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:08.800]   Oh, I've seen stuff coming through my phone.
[00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:09.920]   See, everybody gets it.
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:10.640]   Everybody gets it.
[00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:11.600]   I don't get it.
[00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:11.920]   All right.
[00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:13.280]   Wait, that is so weird.
[00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:15.280]   I was wondering what those notifications were.
[00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:16.480]   It's irritating, isn't it?
[00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:19.840]   I get comments because I'm somehow in your NiceBook.
[00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:20.160]   Yes.
[00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:22.320]   I get those comments on my phone.
[00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:22.720]   Right.
[00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:25.840]   So, I've invited everybody on Facebook to join me.
[00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:29.920]   I post pictures of my personal life, my squishy face,
[00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:31.280]   all this stuff.
[00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:34.560]   And then until July, I'm going to be posting those on Facebook
[00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:36.400]   so that people can click through to my NiceBook.
[00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:38.160]   Mike Elgin's NiceBook.
[00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:38.640]   There it is.
[00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:39.600]   How did it get there?
[00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:40.560]   Oh, you shared them with me.
[00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:41.040]   I shared it.
[00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:43.120]   I didn't even have to say yes.
[00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:43.600]   That's right.
[00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:45.680]   That's the best part.
[00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:46.640]   You're pushing content.
[00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:49.440]   But anybody who wants to join it can join it.
[00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:51.120]   It's completely open to the public.
[00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:51.760]   But why join it?
[00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:52.720]   I'm getting it anyway.
[00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:54.560]   Well, you have to drop the introduction.
[00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:55.040]   Exactly.
[00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:55.520]   Oh.
[00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:58.400]   So, it's all the good things about Facebook.
[00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:00.800]   You share photos and comments and things like people can like it
[00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:01.360]   and all that stuff.
[00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:03.920]   Without any of the disinformation, the fake news,
[00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:07.200]   the Russian, probably, whatever, the manipulation,
[00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:09.040]   the lying, the ads, none of that.
[00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:10.240]   It's the best part of Instagram.
[00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:11.440]   And there's comments.
[00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:13.760]   It can be the notifications can go through the app
[00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:17.280]   and also through email, which means it has three times the reach of Facebook.
[00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:20.800]   Three times as many people can see my NiceBook.
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:22.320]   So, this can see Facebook.
[00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:26.160]   So, if I set this up, I would have to add people by their email.
[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:30.480]   This actually, I just read an article about this being a problem
[00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:31.920]   that you don't have to say yes.
[00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:32.720]   People can--
[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:32.960]   People can--
[00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:32.960]   People can--
[00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:33.600]   harassment problems.
[00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:33.760]   Yeah.
[00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:34.560]   So, they can share--
[00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:39.280]   You know, I get already a ridiculous amount of harassment on Google's Hangouts.
[00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:39.760]   Yeah.
[00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:41.120]   It's very easy for people.
[00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:43.280]   I get so-called women.
[00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:43.680]   They're--
[00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:46.160]   I'm sure never women, you know, saying, "Hey, baby."
[00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:48.800]   But it's always in French because my name's Le Porte.
[00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:51.760]   So, it's easy to ignore.
[00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:54.160]   And that they even try to call.
[00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:55.200]   I mean, I even get calls.
[00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:55.200]   Yeah.
[00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:55.920]   Oh, sure.
[00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:56.960]   This is a problem.
[00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:59.600]   But with this concept, you can block anybody.
[00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:01.280]   And it's easy to do.
[00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:03.280]   But you don't have to invite anybody necessarily.
[00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:04.560]   You can just put the--
[00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:05.440]   It'll give you a link.
[00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:06.640]   You say, "Here, everybody, here's the link."
[00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:07.840]   And they can just join.
[00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:08.880]   They want to.
[00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:10.720]   They can set their own notifications.
[00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:12.400]   The difficulty of interacting is--
[00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:14.480]   it's actually easier than Facebook.
[00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:17.440]   The quality of photos is like 10 times better than Facebook.
[00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:18.960]   Everything about it is better than Facebook.
[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:20.960]   So, I'm just going to see if this works.
[00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:24.000]   I like that because what I've wanted since I deactivated Instagram
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.200]   is just my public Instagram page without the social element.
[00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:29.120]   And everyone goes, "That's a blog, dude."
[00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:29.600]   Yeah.
[00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:29.920]   Yeah.
[00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:31.200]   Like, "Yes, but I don't want to set a blog up.
[00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:32.160]   I want you to do it for me.
[00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:33.120]   I just want to upload photos to it."
[00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:34.880]   Maybe this is going to be my middle ground.
[00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:35.840]   I kind of like the idea.
[00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:36.880]   It's so easy and fun.
[00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:38.960]   Do you think there's much scope for a paid social network?
[00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:40.880]   Because we were arguing about this in the pub
[00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:41.600]   before Christmas.
[00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:44.400]   And it's like, "I don't honestly think people are willing to pay
[00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:45.520]   for a social network."
[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:49.280]   I don't like it at all because people have different levels of ability to pay.
[00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:51.360]   And so, you're creating this--
[00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:52.720]   Yeah, it's true.
[00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:53.600]   --thing.
[00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:55.520]   And I've always supported that app.net.
[00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:56.560]   Hey, Walt's brother.
[00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:57.440]   It's like a new father.
[00:27:57.440 --> 00:27:59.120]   So, by the way, Mike, just as a little tip,
[00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:00.640]   you could also make a blog this way.
[00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:01.920]   Google's Drive--
[00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:06.000]   Google Drive's sharing system also has the same permissions problem.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.440]   Somebody can share with you.
[00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:09.040]   You don't have to accept it.
[00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:10.720]   And if you only have view permissions,
[00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:13.360]   you can't remove yourself from the share.
[00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:15.920]   This is from an article in How To Geek.
[00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:18.240]   They said they would fix it, though, and we'll see if they do.
[00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:19.680]   But yeah, that's a really weird problem.
[00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:20.720]   There's actual--
[00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:23.520]   I read that and I'm like, "There's spam in Google Drive."
[00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:24.880]   There will always be spam.
[00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:26.880]   Where there is a display, there shall be--
[00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:28.080]   Spam is like water.
[00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:28.960]   It can't--
[00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:30.320]   So, there's no app in this spot.
[00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:30.960]   But the same thing could happen.
[00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:33.840]   Now, I have to point out they've got to fix it in photos, too.
[00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:36.000]   Because let's say you were an abusive spouse
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.440]   and you wanted to use this to harass somebody, you could do that.
[00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:43.360]   So, on the other hand, I like being part of Mike's nice book.
[00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:44.240]   But--
[00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:45.280]   I like the name of it.
[00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:46.480]   Yeah.
[00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:49.760]   It's all-- it's everything that Facebook has,
[00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:51.200]   but only the nice parts.
[00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:51.520]   Yeah.
[00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:52.640]   It's hysterical.
[00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:54.960]   And there's all these comments.
[00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:58.000]   What was weird is I was getting notifications for the comments.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:58.560]   Yeah.
[00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:00.080]   And I didn't even know why.
[00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:00.800]   Yeah.
[00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:03.600]   I immediately went and did a how-to about how
[00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:05.440]   to adjust your notifications because I was kind of--
[00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:05.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:06.560]   --speaking of spam.
[00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:07.040]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:08.240]   You're going to get some notes from people.
[00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:12.400]   I like getting Happy New Year, Mike, and Amira in my notification.
[00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:15.040]   No, you want to know that someone else wishes him Happy New Year?
[00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:15.520]   You're going to get it.
[00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:17.840]   It's just like Twitter when they say, oh, this other person
[00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:19.040]   liked somebody else's thing.
[00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:19.920]   I'm like, I don't care.
[00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:21.040]   That's the funny bit about all this.
[00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:22.880]   I've been talking a lot of smack on Twitter about how I'm like,
[00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:25.040]   I'm off of Instagram now to leave you my Facebook account.
[00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:26.960]   And I'm like, what I'm telling you on Twitter,
[00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:28.560]   which I am horribly addicted to.
[00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:29.040]   Exactly.
[00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:30.480]   Just plug that into my veins.
[00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:32.560]   If you're a journalist, there's no escaping.
[00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:33.080]   Yeah.
[00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:34.640]   I think it's hard to ignore the abuse.
[00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:36.000]   Twitter is the one I can't give up.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:37.040]   Twitter knows.
[00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:38.400]   Yes, it is.
[00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:42.560]   I mean, Twitter, you could make the argument,
[00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:44.880]   oh, the Arab Spring, they keep bringing that up.
[00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:48.640]   But I can bring up so many more cases where people have
[00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:51.120]   killed themselves over bullying on Twitter.
[00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:53.600]   The abuse that happens, the abuse I get, and others get--
[00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:54.640]   I mean, I was happy.
[00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:57.120]   I have never been happier leaving a network than Twitter.
[00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:57.680]   Yeah.
[00:29:57.680 --> 00:29:59.920]   It was a little hard to leave Instagram and Facebook.
[00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:01.440]   But Twitter, that was easy.
[00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:03.680]   Yeah, you see, I've never had an Instagram account.
[00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:05.120]   I couldn't see the points of it.
[00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:06.000]   Pictures are--
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:07.360]   How annoying--
[00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:08.320]   I don't think how many pictures.
[00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:10.240]   But yeah, you know pictures are nice.
[00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:12.720]   But then I started feeling bad because everybody's life
[00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:14.800]   looked better than mine.
[00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:15.200]   Exactly.
[00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:16.160]   Everybody feels that way.
[00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:18.600]   And it's just an inevitable part of human nature.
[00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:21.640]   But another part of human nature that's driving some of this
[00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:23.200]   is-- and we're all guilty.
[00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:25.200]   Everybody at this table is guilty of this.
[00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:27.120]   We have a bias for the new.
[00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:28.520]   And old stuff is like--
[00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:29.920]   Because I tell-- what's the solution?
[00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:30.720]   It's our monkey mind.
[00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:31.120]   It's RSS.
[00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:32.400]   It's email newsletters.
[00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:33.320]   It's all this old stuff.
[00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:34.120]   And it works great.
[00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:35.080]   Nobody wants to talk about it.
[00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:36.400]   But that's the solution, actually.
[00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:38.920]   Well, try finding a decent RSS reader now that's basically
[00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:39.880]   feedly, and that's it.
[00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:40.520]   I use Google.
[00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:41.560]   We've had to write our own.
[00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:41.720]   Right.
[00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:42.520]   I have a pixel book.
[00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:42.520]   Really?
[00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:43.760]   I have a pixel book.
[00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:46.120]   And I just have an extension that turns--
[00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:47.520]   this becomes an RSS reader.
[00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:51.440]   You know what's the last bastion of RSS podcast?
[00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:51.920]   Podcasting.
[00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:52.800]   It's a good point.
[00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:53.640]   That's right.
[00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:55.600]   I mean, that's the only-- that's how people know we have a new
[00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:56.520]   show as RSS.
[00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:57.120]   Well, I run the--
[00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:59.120]   They don't know it, but they're subscribing to it.
[00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:00.360]   Look how great it works.
[00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:00.860]   Yeah.
[00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:01.960]   It's very effective.
[00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:03.000]   It's worked for 12 years.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   Yeah.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.240]   I think email newsletters are coming back because Axios,
[00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:08.480]   the new-- well, new-ish media company,
[00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:11.280]   has built their entire platform on short-form articles,
[00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:12.280]   sent out through newsletters.
[00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:12.800]   It's brilliant.
[00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:13.080]   What?
[00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:14.560]   That's how Axios works now?
[00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:15.040]   Yeah.
[00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:16.920]   So if you read through their website,
[00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:18.920]   it's kind of like the same chunks you can see inside of
[00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:20.520]   newsletters I'll send out to you in the mornings or the
[00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:21.440]   afternoons.
[00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:22.160]   And it's a kind of a brilliant--
[00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:22.640]   Oh, that's brilliant.
[00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:23.160]   --newsletter.
[00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:24.440]   I used to get that from Axios.
[00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:26.160]   Yeah, you should put this name, Mike, or--
[00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:26.880]   Dan Prima--
[00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:27.880]   Dan, Dean Prima--
[00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:28.400]   He's the fan.
[00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:29.400]   --the new-ish newsletter that's coming back.
[00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:30.880]   Yeah, and then Mike Allen has a--
[00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:33.040]   Wake up to what matters from Mike Allen every day.
[00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:34.040]   Yeah, Axios is fun.
[00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:35.880]   But the newsletters are their jam.
[00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:38.120]   And they've been around since, like, what, 85?
[00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:38.480]   Yeah.
[00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:40.400]   I've been saying for a long time also that the best social
[00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:41.880]   network by far is email.
[00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:45.120]   And so email newsletters is one avenue of that.
[00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:49.520]   People need to spend more time managing their filters
[00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:50.440]   and all that kind of stuff.
[00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:51.120]   That's the problem.
[00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:52.200]   And email can be beautiful.
[00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:52.720]   Yeah.
[00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:55.760]   I have one filter that says, if there's unsubscribe in the
[00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:57.960]   body of this message, stick it over here.
[00:31:57.960 --> 00:32:00.040]   You want to see all of your newsletters.
[00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:00.520]   Yeah.
[00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:01.680]   Or ending up in that folder.
[00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:03.120]   But at least they're all there.
[00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:03.640]   I could find--
[00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:06.400]   I was wondering where they were going.
[00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:09.040]   That's how he broke through the noise he shared his photos.
[00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:10.920]   I'm going to remove the unsubscribe.
[00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:11.600]   I think there's a--
[00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:13.000]   Oh, I should say that.
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.920]   I shouldn't say that.
[00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:16.720]   Well, that's a great filter, by the way.
[00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:17.520]   Highly recommended.
[00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:20.040]   It's just a newsletter filter.
[00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:24.240]   But I think a lot-- people always tell me, Jason Calican,
[00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:25.640]   as you say, click through rate of newsletters.
[00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:26.640]   Fantastic.
[00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:28.360]   His whole business is now newsletters.
[00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:29.000]   You know what it is, Ryan?
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:29.560]   But I don't get it.
[00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:31.640]   I don't want to--
[00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:32.920]   maybe I get too many newsletters.
[00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:36.640]   My click through rate is typically 58%.
[00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:38.000]   You mean your open rate?
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:39.680]   My open rate is 58%.
[00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:40.960]   The click rate is--
[00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:42.040]   I mean, it's astronomical.
[00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:43.000]   That's nuts.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:43.200]   Yeah.
[00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:44.200]   So good.
[00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:45.640]   Think about Facebook.
[00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:48.480]   Your stuff ends up in the news fees of about 5%
[00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:49.560]   of the people that--
[00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:50.360]   Here's another problem.
[00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:51.840]   A lot of that, though, in this--
[00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:54.320]   I'm looking at my My Subscriptions folder--
[00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:56.640]   is advertising.
[00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:57.760]   Sir La Tobla.
[00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:01.000]   It's instant pot 60% off.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:02.200]   American-figure Democrats.
[00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:03.240]   It's pretty good.
[00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:05.240]   No, see, this is why I can't read these.
[00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:07.040]   Because I will then buy an Instagram.
[00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:08.760]   And we get to know how I bought one last year,
[00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:10.360]   and the year before, and the year before that.
[00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:12.120]   Well, I know people throw into their Instagram.
[00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:13.080]   It's a pressure cooker.
[00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:13.840]   They're amazing, though.
[00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:16.400]   But we just took Leo's credit card.
[00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:18.640]   I think the internet will be safe again.
[00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:20.080]   That might be the only thing we need to do.
[00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:22.800]   Well, I just don't look at it anymore.
[00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:24.360]   Yeah, I mean, this is all the newsletters.
[00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:26.760]   The problem is the good stuff, like here's Jessica
[00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:29.000]   Lesson's information newsletter.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:29.560]   I want to read.
[00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:31.040]   But that's buried in the middle with this.
[00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:31.560]   You're paying for it.
[00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:32.200]   You should read it.
[00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:33.840]   I know, $400 a year.
[00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:36.560]   And I'm sure I'm getting Mike's list.
[00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:38.440]   And Stacey Higginbotham's list.
[00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:38.960]   It was fantastic.
[00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:41.560]   So who are these people that are reading these?
[00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:45.600]   Because clearly, most of my newsletters are junk banks.
[00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:47.440]   It's people who don't get paid to be informed.
[00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:49.080]   Because if you don't get paid to be informed,
[00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:51.360]   then you work at a job where you click buttons
[00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:52.920]   and put things in spreadsheets, you
[00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:55.360]   want a digest in the morning you can read on the commute
[00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:57.480]   or at the coffee spot to get caught up.
[00:33:57.480 --> 00:34:00.680]   And so us, at this table, we get paid to know stuff, which
[00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:02.280]   is a great, great job to be clear.
[00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:04.200]   But that's why a newsletter roundup for me is ridiculous.
[00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:05.160]   So I don't need it.
[00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:08.520]   Look, I get the times in print and providence every day.
[00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:09.240]   Well, five days a week.
[00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:09.920]   And so I read it.
[00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:12.440]   And often I'm like, oh, this is just last night's news.
[00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:15.640]   Every time I get the sound, I just read all this.
[00:34:15.640 --> 00:34:16.480]   This happened again.
[00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:16.800]   Oh, no.
[00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:17.080]   There are--
[00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:18.000]   But Liza loves it.
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.040]   Liza has a job that's not centered around being on Twitter
[00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:20.800]   24 hours a day.
[00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:21.960]   And so for her, it's fantastic.
[00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:26.480]   This is why tech prepundance should not be talking about tech.
[00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:27.960]   So we should talk about golf, something
[00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:29.240]   we don't know anything about.
[00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:30.200]   That's the--
[00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:31.040]   For a good, well-grubin.
[00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:33.800]   I find twice the innervents.
[00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:34.160]   Anyways.
[00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:35.440]   Let's take a break.
[00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:37.520]   Great panel here, actually.
[00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:39.880]   I don't know why-- how did we get out of the habit of--
[00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:41.360]   oh, it's because half the time you're in Providence.
[00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:44.040]   No, the last time I was on you were on vacation.
[00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:45.600]   And I had to be in was hosting.
[00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:47.600]   So it's really nice to see Alex Wilhelm.
[00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:52.600]   He's editor in chief of Crunchbase News.
[00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:54.320]   And obviously, if you want to know financial news,
[00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:56.440]   especially, that's a really great place to go.
[00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:58.280]   What is the URL?
[00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:00.120]   News.crunchbase.com.
[00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:01.320]   Or Crunchbase.news.
[00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:02.080]   How about you want to do it?
[00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:03.400]   I like dot news.
[00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:05.840]   Yeah, but it's kind of this weird custom TLDs that still
[00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:06.600]   seem a little cheap to me.
[00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:07.080]   Do people don't?
[00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:07.640]   Yeah.
[00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:10.920]   So I set up an email address, which is dot email.
[00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:12.200]   And Liza won't use it.
[00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:13.280]   She says, what is that?
[00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:14.320]   You mean dot com?
[00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:15.520]   Said no dot email.
[00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:18.280]   We were very classless about our TLDs, I feel.
[00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:21.640]   I thought all emails should be dot email.
[00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:23.800]   Yeah, I mean, depends, really.
[00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:25.920]   Honestly, you're saying classes about TLDs,
[00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:27.720]   classes about emails as well.
[00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:30.520]   We were getting resumes in to hire a new journalist.
[00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:31.640]   One guy sent his resume.
[00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:32.960]   He was using a hotmail account.
[00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:33.880]   Well, see, that's bad.
[00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:34.880]   That goes straight to the bin.
[00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:36.920]   That's bad.
[00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:38.080]   Not even outlook.com.
[00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:38.760]   Just get rid of that.
[00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:43.120]   Yeah, it's not quite AOL levels are bad, but it's still bad.
[00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:43.640]   Can't.
[00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:46.080]   If I get an email from Leo at Leo dot email,
[00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:46.960]   I'm not going to open it.
[00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:48.400]   I'm like, that's bad.
[00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:49.560]   Yeah, you'd think spam.
[00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:51.600]   How do you think I'm going to get fished here?
[00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:52.320]   That I'm going to be embarrassed.
[00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:56.120]   So I set up my own mail server at home, this helm thing.
[00:35:56.120 --> 00:35:58.240]   And I have a special email address.
[00:35:58.240 --> 00:35:59.400]   And you know what I love about it?
[00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:00.920]   I get no email.
[00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:03.000]   I don't even-- it's not even that I don't get spam.
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.240]   I get no email.
[00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:05.760]   No newsletters.
[00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:06.880]   Nothing from you guys.
[00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:07.520]   It's great.
[00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:10.040]   If only they could build a physical mailbox
[00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:11.680]   for the brother house that never cooks up.
[00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:13.680]   No, but then people send crappy things
[00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:15.280]   to your physical mailbox and stuff and stuff.
[00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:17.200]   Something's going-- something has gone wrong in my brain
[00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:19.040]   because I have started learning
[00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:22.040]   Spencerian penmanship with a fountain pen.
[00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:24.080]   I'm getting off social networks.
[00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:29.040]   I got post note cards that are sent out for notes.
[00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:31.560]   I think I'm retreating to the Victorian.
[00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:34.520]   You're going to sweat her with buttons on air.
[00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:37.080]   You should have a telegraph wire come to your house.
[00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:38.640]   Do the whole thing.
[00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:41.040]   I think someone's going to have all those sort of moustelses
[00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:42.040]   like that in the top hat.
[00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:43.200]   I need the procedure.
[00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:45.720]   I am a refugee from the 21st century.
[00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:46.800]   Now, let's--
[00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:47.680]   Did I join you?
[00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:48.640]   That sounds amazing.
[00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:49.080]   You know what?
[00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:50.040]   Think about it.
[00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:51.280]   Not such a bad idea.
[00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:53.640]   Neil Stevenson was there with-- if you've read "Diamond Age,"
[00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:55.160]   Neil Stevenson's book, we were-- we
[00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:56.520]   regressed in Neo-Victorians with technology.
[00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:58.760]   I want all the medical care.
[00:36:58.760 --> 00:36:59.800]   You know, all the science.
[00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:01.520]   Victorian dentistry is not good.
[00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:03.160]   I want the dentistry.
[00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:07.120]   But I don't want any of this social media, super fast,
[00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:08.360]   always connected stuff.
[00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:11.440]   Like the village, like M Night-- what's his name?
[00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:12.160]   The village.
[00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:13.760]   Shamalamadimdong.
[00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:15.560]   Duckeye.
[00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:20.000]   They moved out of the real world to an old 18th century world.
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.840]   And they grazed their kids that way.
[00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:22.340]   Yeah.
[00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:24.000]   And when you need something, you send the blind girl out
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:24.600]   in the real world.
[00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:26.440]   Yeah, to send her out to get some medicine.
[00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:27.360]   What is this thing?
[00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:28.040]   Is it a movie?
[00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:29.040]   Yeah.
[00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:31.280]   We just spoiled it for you, by the way.
[00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:31.760]   No, I'm not going to watch it.
[00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:32.840]   No need to watch it now.
[00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:34.440]   We should do this at adventure.
[00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:37.080]   All of Shamalamadimdong's movies have twist endings.
[00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:37.580]   That's right.
[00:37:37.580 --> 00:37:40.160]   So you really should never-- it's always a spoiler to talk about.
[00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:41.780]   After the break, we can spoil the rest of them.
[00:37:41.780 --> 00:37:42.640]   Yeah, what if you'd like?
[00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:43.360]   This will be a fun--
[00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:44.720]   There are dead people.
[00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:46.280]   Yes, I've seen that one.
[00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:47.720]   Bruce Willis and his career--
[00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:49.220]   All right, all right, all right.
[00:37:49.220 --> 00:37:50.680]   I'm-- yeah.
[00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:53.120]   Our show today brought to you by-- sorry about the spoilers,
[00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:53.860]   kids.
[00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:55.880]   But if you haven't seen the village, forget everything I said
[00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:57.000]   and go see it.
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:00.160]   It is actually a great movie.
[00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:03.160]   Today's show brought to you by Atlassian.
[00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:06.440]   Now, this is a part of the 21st century I'm liking.
[00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:09.780]   Staying competitive in a cloud-based world
[00:38:09.780 --> 00:38:13.580]   means your teams need to work together and execute faster.
[00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:14.860]   Your IT team does.
[00:38:14.860 --> 00:38:19.700]   And Atlassian empowers everything we do in IT.
[00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:21.260]   It's the company behind JIRA, of course,
[00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:24.100]   and every developer knows JIRA for agile development.
[00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:26.380]   But we also use Confluence.
[00:38:26.380 --> 00:38:28.100]   We use Bitbucket.
[00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:31.180]   We use JIRA to keep track of punch lists, things
[00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:33.380]   that need to be done to communicate.
[00:38:33.380 --> 00:38:38.540]   Atlassian uses software to manage complex collaboration.
[00:38:38.540 --> 00:38:39.860]   And it does it so beautiful.
[00:38:39.860 --> 00:38:41.460]   It's the technology backbone that
[00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:44.700]   helps modern IT organizations plan, service, and support.
[00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:46.540]   The kind of change that propels the business.
[00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:48.700]   And it doesn't have to be really an IT organization.
[00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:51.620]   We use Confluence for our engineering staff
[00:38:51.620 --> 00:38:54.660]   so that they can keep track of what's going on with the equipment,
[00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:56.140]   what's going on with the network.
[00:38:56.140 --> 00:38:56.980]   It's DevOps.
[00:38:56.980 --> 00:38:58.180]   It's agile development.
[00:38:58.180 --> 00:39:01.340]   It's IT apps and ops, ITSM.
[00:39:01.340 --> 00:39:04.140]   And whatever is next, an affordable,
[00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:08.180]   and this important, affordable, reliable suite of tools.
[00:39:08.180 --> 00:39:11.060]   JIRA software, Confluence, and Bitbucket.
[00:39:11.060 --> 00:39:14.060]   Atlassian forms a backbone of effective cross-team project
[00:39:14.060 --> 00:39:16.860]   planning organization and communication.
[00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:18.860]   And don't forget JIRA ops and ops,
[00:39:18.860 --> 00:39:20.820]   Genie and Standish page, which helps
[00:39:20.820 --> 00:39:23.220]   you keep track of incidents, alert response teams,
[00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:26.420]   coordinate response efforts to resolve issues faster
[00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:29.900]   and keep customers or stakeholders, like me, updated.
[00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:32.660]   Your team could choose tools that are right for your current framework,
[00:39:32.660 --> 00:39:36.180]   while trusting that as you grow, they will grow with you.
[00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:39.140]   And of course, it all integrates right into JIRA and Confluence.
[00:39:39.140 --> 00:39:40.980]   So you don't have to go from platform to platform.
[00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:44.220]   Everything you need is right there.
[00:39:44.220 --> 00:39:45.740]   We love Atlassian.
[00:39:45.740 --> 00:39:47.380]   And of course, you will, too.
[00:39:47.380 --> 00:39:51.780]   And like all of Atlassian's products, the tools for your IT team
[00:39:51.780 --> 00:39:56.660]   are easy and easy to configure, easy to set up, and free to try.
[00:39:56.660 --> 00:40:00.820]   So go to Atlassian.com and find out what's right for you
[00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:03.860]   at lassian.com for IT.
[00:40:03.860 --> 00:40:08.660]   Unleash your IT team with Atlassian's collaboration software tools.
[00:40:08.660 --> 00:40:09.740]   You know, I love that Atlassian.
[00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:10.180]   What?
[00:40:10.180 --> 00:40:13.420]   Their ticker symbol in the stock market is team.
[00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:13.900]   Oh, that's cool.
[00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:15.340]   Just like the best vanity license plate ever.
[00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:17.340]   Oh, that's nice.
[00:40:17.340 --> 00:40:18.380]   You know tickers.
[00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:18.820]   I do.
[00:40:18.820 --> 00:40:20.900]   I pull it up to double check, actually, before I said that,
[00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:22.980]   on the air, to make sure that I went wrong.
[00:40:22.980 --> 00:40:23.540]   You have to.
[00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:25.300]   Like I know AAPO.
[00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:25.500]   Yeah.
[00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:26.500]   Right?
[00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:27.740]   Facebook is Fbook, right?
[00:40:27.740 --> 00:40:28.340]   FB.
[00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:29.740]   FB.
[00:40:29.740 --> 00:40:30.740]   Fbook would be better.
[00:40:30.740 --> 00:40:31.340]   Fbook would be better.
[00:40:31.340 --> 00:40:34.020]   That describes how we feel about it.
[00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:36.220]   But most companies have Netflix and FLX.
[00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:37.340]   They don't have jokey.
[00:40:37.340 --> 00:40:37.860]   No.
[00:40:37.860 --> 00:40:39.020]   AT&T had tea.
[00:40:39.020 --> 00:40:39.660]   That was cool.
[00:40:39.660 --> 00:40:40.220]   That was quite good.
[00:40:40.220 --> 00:40:42.140]   That's like they were the first stock ever, probably.
[00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:43.780]   Salesforce has CRM.
[00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:44.460]   Oh, that's good.
[00:40:44.460 --> 00:40:44.940]   That's quite good.
[00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:45.940]   It's witty.
[00:40:45.940 --> 00:40:48.860]   If you're into financial tech jokes, which is me and--
[00:40:48.860 --> 00:40:50.780]   The sense of very limited audience.
[00:40:50.780 --> 00:40:51.940]   You're the king.
[00:40:51.940 --> 00:40:52.620]   You're the king.
[00:40:52.620 --> 00:40:54.180]   Oh, man.
[00:40:54.180 --> 00:40:55.180]   Let's see.
[00:40:55.180 --> 00:40:55.780]   Have we done all the--
[00:40:55.780 --> 00:40:56.820]   Are they all obsessed with it?
[00:40:56.820 --> 00:40:58.300]   Apple stuff.
[00:40:58.300 --> 00:41:01.260]   The Apple store as Apple was quick to point out,
[00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:02.260]   this is, I guess, one of the--
[00:41:02.260 --> 00:41:04.260]   It's the very next day that press--
[00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:04.980]   This is interesting.
[00:41:04.980 --> 00:41:07.060]   I got this press release about the Apple store
[00:41:07.060 --> 00:41:09.700]   capping off a blockbuster Christmas weekend.
[00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:13.180]   And Google flagged it up as potentially finished spam
[00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:13.540]   and phishing.
[00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:14.540]   It's terrible.
[00:41:14.540 --> 00:41:17.220]   And so I got in contact because I get my Apple releases
[00:41:17.220 --> 00:41:19.620]   for Apple UK because Apple US haters.
[00:41:19.620 --> 00:41:23.220]   And Apple-- I contacted my contacts at Apple UK.
[00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:24.860]   And so, mate, seriously, you've just
[00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:27.060]   been identified as a phishing email by Google.
[00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:28.820]   It's like, I don't think we've been virus.
[00:41:28.820 --> 00:41:30.220]   It's like, no, I don't think you've been virus.
[00:41:30.220 --> 00:41:32.100]   I just think Google is playing silly, but they've
[00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:34.180]   getting too many false false threats from something.
[00:41:34.180 --> 00:41:35.820]   Oh, maybe that is true.
[00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:37.380]   They take signals from users.
[00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:37.380]   Yeah.
[00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:38.940]   It could be a lot of users were saying.
[00:41:38.940 --> 00:41:40.660]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:41:40.660 --> 00:41:45.060]   $1.2 billion spent during the holiday period
[00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:47.420]   and a new single day record on New Year's Day.
[00:41:47.420 --> 00:41:50.100]   It's always a good time for Apple because people
[00:41:50.100 --> 00:41:54.100]   get new devices for the holidays and then rush to the app store.
[00:41:54.100 --> 00:41:56.020]   But that is a spectacular amount of--
[00:41:56.020 --> 00:41:58.220]   That's a lot of thought-ups.
[00:41:58.220 --> 00:41:59.380]   And flashlight apps.
[00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:00.780]   Aren't they mostly free?
[00:42:00.780 --> 00:42:04.860]   $322 million on New Year's Day alone, 322.
[00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:07.180]   And remember, Apple gets a third of that.
[00:42:07.180 --> 00:42:08.740]   Well, just under.
[00:42:08.740 --> 00:42:09.260]   Little under.
[00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:10.100]   30%.
[00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:12.820]   Well, one thing every venture capitalist does on Christmas
[00:42:12.820 --> 00:42:15.260]   morning and New Year's Day is pull up the App Store rankings
[00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:17.020]   and see who's performing the best.
[00:42:17.020 --> 00:42:18.580]   You can see if Amazon is on a little bit of apps
[00:42:18.580 --> 00:42:20.220]   or are shooting at the top of the App Store.
[00:42:20.220 --> 00:42:22.860]   You can presume high volume there, better platform
[00:42:22.860 --> 00:42:24.060]   for startups, et cetera.
[00:42:24.060 --> 00:42:26.340]   So it's kind of fun to see this from both the inside the App Store
[00:42:26.340 --> 00:42:28.460]   perspective and also from the meta perspective, which
[00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:30.740]   is how much total volume and through.
[00:42:30.740 --> 00:42:34.100]   But I think the 30% cut will not last another year.
[00:42:34.100 --> 00:42:36.260]   No, they're going to have to change it.
[00:42:36.260 --> 00:42:38.100]   Just the market forces alone are forcing them down.
[00:42:38.100 --> 00:42:40.900]   They don't own enough of the market to demand--
[00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:43.380]   is that monopsonity pricing or is that monopoly pricing?
[00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:45.580]   Yeah, or dual-play if you're taking into them
[00:42:45.580 --> 00:42:48.740]   and on the other hand.
[00:42:48.740 --> 00:42:50.420]   If you're an app developer, you're
[00:42:50.420 --> 00:42:51.940]   willing to give them-- in many cases,
[00:42:51.940 --> 00:42:54.980]   willing to give them that 30% because you're
[00:42:54.980 --> 00:42:56.780]   on a platform that makes you money.
[00:42:56.780 --> 00:42:58.900]   Look at Fortnite for crying out loud.
[00:42:58.900 --> 00:43:00.700]   But Fortnite now has its own store.
[00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:01.180]   They tell you--
[00:43:01.180 --> 00:43:01.940]   No, they didn't like it.
[00:43:01.940 --> 00:43:04.420]   But on the other hand, honestly, yeah,
[00:43:04.420 --> 00:43:06.420]   they would probably prefer to be on--
[00:43:06.420 --> 00:43:08.100]   as they are on Android, on the Apple Store,
[00:43:08.100 --> 00:43:10.620]   without giving Apple a cut.
[00:43:10.620 --> 00:43:13.780]   But I think they're also pretty happy about the amount
[00:43:13.780 --> 00:43:14.940]   of money they've made.
[00:43:14.940 --> 00:43:15.820]   True.
[00:43:15.820 --> 00:43:17.660]   But then all of a sudden, you need to grow a little faster,
[00:43:17.660 --> 00:43:20.460]   hit the numbers, and that 30% seems a lot bigger than it did
[00:43:20.460 --> 00:43:21.740]   when you were just happy to have someone else
[00:43:21.740 --> 00:43:22.740]   distill your apps for you.
[00:43:22.740 --> 00:43:23.340]   When your brand is--
[00:43:23.340 --> 00:43:24.140]   What is the pressure?
[00:43:24.140 --> 00:43:25.700]   How can they bring enough pressure to Apple
[00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:26.700]   to make them change that?
[00:43:26.700 --> 00:43:28.500]   Well, I mean, one of the stories that I was reading up
[00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:30.820]   before the show is that Netflix is going to stop paying
[00:43:30.820 --> 00:43:32.820]   the Apple products, and they drive hundreds of millions
[00:43:32.820 --> 00:43:34.340]   of dollars of revenue through iOS.
[00:43:34.340 --> 00:43:37.780]   Yeah, that's a huge $853 million in annual iOS revenue.
[00:43:37.780 --> 00:43:38.280]   Right.
[00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:39.780]   So now they're going to take that away from Apple.
[00:43:39.780 --> 00:43:41.220]   Apple doesn't get a 30% cut of that.
[00:43:41.220 --> 00:43:43.300]   If you're Apple and you need to grow your services' income,
[00:43:43.300 --> 00:43:45.740]   as we touched on the first segment, that's critical.
[00:43:45.740 --> 00:43:46.940]   That's your margin right there.
[00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:48.940]   But in that case, you could safely say
[00:43:48.940 --> 00:43:52.420]   that's rent-taking on Apple's part, because Apple--
[00:43:52.420 --> 00:43:54.260]   it's one thing if you're delivering the app,
[00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:56.060]   and people pay for the app.
[00:43:56.060 --> 00:43:57.740]   Apple's giving you some value.
[00:43:57.740 --> 00:44:00.820]   But if you're already in Netflix app, you've got the app,
[00:44:00.820 --> 00:44:03.140]   and you're giving-- or Kindle books, for instance,
[00:44:03.140 --> 00:44:05.740]   you're giving Apple a third of the subscription fee,
[00:44:05.740 --> 00:44:07.460]   that's rent-taking on Apple's part.
[00:44:07.460 --> 00:44:08.780]   I think that that's really wrong.
[00:44:08.780 --> 00:44:10.140]   Apple might have to give up on that.
[00:44:10.140 --> 00:44:11.740]   And haven't they reduced the amount of money
[00:44:11.740 --> 00:44:13.220]   they take for subscriptions after the first year?
[00:44:13.220 --> 00:44:15.260]   Isn't there something like after a certain amount of money
[00:44:15.260 --> 00:44:15.700]   at the time?
[00:44:15.700 --> 00:44:16.740]   You have to take less.
[00:44:16.740 --> 00:44:17.900]   Yeah.
[00:44:17.900 --> 00:44:20.020]   Which I think they had to, because once you get
[00:44:20.020 --> 00:44:22.940]   to a certain number of sales, you don't need Apple that much
[00:44:22.940 --> 00:44:26.820]   anymore, and you are just paying them a third, well, 30%,
[00:44:26.820 --> 00:44:28.260]   for very little.
[00:44:28.260 --> 00:44:30.140]   I mean, yeah, you get to be in the app store.
[00:44:30.140 --> 00:44:32.380]   Well, people want to buy this app anyway,
[00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:33.420]   as we saw before tonight.
[00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:34.900]   Yeah, but as a developer, you don't
[00:44:34.900 --> 00:44:36.260]   have to have anywhere to download.
[00:44:36.260 --> 00:44:37.900]   Apple provides a CDN.
[00:44:37.900 --> 00:44:39.100]   They have Akamai.
[00:44:39.100 --> 00:44:40.580]   They store it for you.
[00:44:40.580 --> 00:44:43.380]   Yeah, but if you're in Netflix or a Fortnite or a big games
[00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:43.740]   developer--
[00:44:43.740 --> 00:44:44.340]   You're doing that anyway.
[00:44:44.340 --> 00:44:45.860]   You can do that anyway.
[00:44:45.860 --> 00:44:46.860]   Right?
[00:44:46.860 --> 00:44:48.220]   But the private games doesn't need Apple to promote their stuff
[00:44:48.220 --> 00:44:49.740]   in the app store to drive downloads.
[00:44:49.740 --> 00:44:53.540]   But that's probably 30 companies out of the 30,000
[00:44:53.540 --> 00:44:54.540]   that are on the app store.
[00:44:54.540 --> 00:44:55.540]   That's the rub, yeah.
[00:44:55.540 --> 00:44:56.860]   But they also-- it's the power law, right?
[00:44:56.860 --> 00:44:57.980]   So they drive most of the revenue.
[00:44:57.980 --> 00:45:01.180]   So Apple doesn't really care if Billy Bob's lemonade factory
[00:45:01.180 --> 00:45:03.300]   app store dot tumbler leaves or not.
[00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:05.620]   No, but they just carry a $853 million
[00:45:05.620 --> 00:45:07.860]   fleas from their pocket from Netflix.
[00:45:07.860 --> 00:45:10.060]   That's a huge amount of money, especially
[00:45:10.060 --> 00:45:12.540]   if you're banking on services to make up a shortfall.
[00:45:12.540 --> 00:45:13.660]   Thanks, yeah.
[00:45:13.660 --> 00:45:13.860]   I know.
[00:45:13.860 --> 00:45:14.980]   That's saying that, what are they?
[00:45:14.980 --> 00:45:15.540]   $20 billion.
[00:45:15.540 --> 00:45:18.660]   But the solution is not lowering the cut.
[00:45:18.660 --> 00:45:21.460]   Or would you rather have $400 million than nothing?
[00:45:21.460 --> 00:45:23.580]   Being developer friendly in the long term
[00:45:23.580 --> 00:45:24.780]   will lead to more income.
[00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:26.980]   It may lead to reduced growth in the short term.
[00:45:26.980 --> 00:45:29.740]   But if everyone that's the high dollar customer, effectively,
[00:45:29.740 --> 00:45:32.060]   are the app store on the app side, on the company side,
[00:45:32.060 --> 00:45:34.100]   leaves, what are you going to have left?
[00:45:34.100 --> 00:45:35.300]   Apple needs this desperately.
[00:45:35.300 --> 00:45:37.620]   They need to have good relations and long-term commitments.
[00:45:37.620 --> 00:45:38.140]   Yeah.
[00:45:38.140 --> 00:45:40.540]   And they've been stiffing people for so long.
[00:45:40.540 --> 00:45:42.500]   Let's go and take a little while to get back.
[00:45:42.500 --> 00:45:44.860]   Everyone, they charge more money for a DRM free song.
[00:45:44.860 --> 00:45:47.260]   That's like the quintessential Apple only thing.
[00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:50.260]   Like $1.29 for iTunes Plus song.
[00:45:50.260 --> 00:45:50.780]   Yeah.
[00:45:50.780 --> 00:45:51.220]   Like--
[00:45:51.220 --> 00:45:51.780]   They forgot about that.
[00:45:51.780 --> 00:45:53.100]   Yeah, it would have placed anywhere else.
[00:45:53.100 --> 00:45:53.980]   You had to pay us extra.
[00:45:53.980 --> 00:45:54.820]   Like, come on, y'all.
[00:45:54.820 --> 00:45:55.460]   Yeah, I know.
[00:45:55.460 --> 00:46:01.660]   Epic creator of Fortnite made $3 billion in profit in 2018.
[00:46:01.660 --> 00:46:04.060]   This is basically on a free-to-play game.
[00:46:04.060 --> 00:46:04.940]   That's what cracks me.
[00:46:04.940 --> 00:46:08.180]   I've got $3 billion in dance moves and costumes.
[00:46:08.180 --> 00:46:08.660]   Yeah.
[00:46:08.660 --> 00:46:09.180]   Incredible.
[00:46:09.180 --> 00:46:09.860]   That's like what happens.
[00:46:09.860 --> 00:46:10.540]   That's also what happened.
[00:46:10.540 --> 00:46:12.660]   That I've never gotten close to winning once.
[00:46:12.660 --> 00:46:13.180]   No.
[00:46:13.180 --> 00:46:15.340]   I've never gotten close to playing once.
[00:46:15.340 --> 00:46:16.140]   Oh, it's fun.
[00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:16.660]   You wouldn't join me.
[00:46:16.660 --> 00:46:16.660]   I know.
[00:46:16.660 --> 00:46:18.980]   Everybody says that I know.
[00:46:18.980 --> 00:46:20.180]   Who has time?
[00:46:20.180 --> 00:46:20.700]   I don't know.
[00:46:20.700 --> 00:46:22.700]   I'm not in Mexico City on a floating picnic table.
[00:46:22.700 --> 00:46:24.100]   What's in Mexico?
[00:46:24.100 --> 00:46:25.700]   I'm busy doing that kind of thing.
[00:46:25.700 --> 00:46:26.820]   I'll trade you for a week.
[00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:28.180]   You have my life played Fortnite.
[00:46:28.180 --> 00:46:30.420]   I'll go on tequila boat or whatever the hell it's called.
[00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:31.460]   Because you know that you're going
[00:46:31.460 --> 00:46:33.020]   to be playing Fortnite from the tequila boat.
[00:46:33.020 --> 00:46:33.580]   I would.
[00:46:33.580 --> 00:46:34.900]   It'd be so much fun.
[00:46:34.900 --> 00:46:35.180]   I would.
[00:46:35.180 --> 00:46:36.740]   To brag and all the 14-year-olds were killing me.
[00:46:36.740 --> 00:46:37.780]   Like, well, yeah, you beat me.
[00:46:37.780 --> 00:46:39.780]   But I'm in Mexico City, so.
[00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:41.140]   There was a wonderful meme on Reddit.
[00:46:41.140 --> 00:46:43.300]   There's a wonderful subreddit on Reddit called Watching People
[00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:44.180]   Die Inside.
[00:46:44.180 --> 00:46:45.740]   And it's this.
[00:46:45.740 --> 00:46:49.380]   This adult with a 14-year-old explaining Fortnite
[00:46:49.380 --> 00:46:51.220]   to him for an hour at Christmas.
[00:46:51.220 --> 00:46:54.220]   And he's just, yeah, OK.
[00:46:54.220 --> 00:46:56.580]   Just let me kill me now.
[00:46:56.580 --> 00:47:01.340]   According to Sensory Tower, Pokemon Go made $795 million
[00:47:01.340 --> 00:47:02.420]   in 2018.
[00:47:02.420 --> 00:47:03.580]   Huge game.
[00:47:03.580 --> 00:47:06.220]   Also, not a free-to-play game.
[00:47:06.220 --> 00:47:10.500]   I mean, also, all of that is just balls.
[00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:11.500]   And eggs.
[00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:12.500]   Stuff.
[00:47:12.500 --> 00:47:13.500]   Balls and eggs.
[00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:15.500]   That didn't actually help to send and smell anything.
[00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:16.500]   I was going to say, yeah.
[00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:17.500]   He's trying to smooth out.
[00:47:17.500 --> 00:47:18.500]   You know what?
[00:47:18.500 --> 00:47:19.500]   He's selling me on Pokemon Go.
[00:47:19.500 --> 00:47:20.500]   Okay.
[00:47:20.500 --> 00:47:21.500]   Balls, eggs, and stardust.
[00:47:21.500 --> 00:47:22.500]   No.
[00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:23.500]   See, it's getting worse.
[00:47:23.500 --> 00:47:24.500]   We do have good round walks in the hair.
[00:47:24.500 --> 00:47:25.500]   It's actually a bit of a mess.
[00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:27.500]   This phenomenon is not new.
[00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:30.180]   Riot Games and League of Legends for the last 10 years
[00:47:30.180 --> 00:47:32.060]   has been driving enormous free-to-play revenue
[00:47:32.060 --> 00:47:33.220]   and kind of showing the way through
[00:47:33.220 --> 00:47:34.420]   my co-transactions and whatnot.
[00:47:34.420 --> 00:47:35.780]   So this is a long time coming.
[00:47:35.780 --> 00:47:38.420]   Couple of weeks ago, we had the 25th anniversary of Doom,
[00:47:38.420 --> 00:47:40.060]   which broke was basically how--
[00:47:40.060 --> 00:47:41.540]   That was the first premium game.
[00:47:41.540 --> 00:47:44.460]   Basically, they gave you the first, what, six levels free.
[00:47:44.460 --> 00:47:45.940]   And then you bought Doom.
[00:47:45.940 --> 00:47:46.940]   Yeah.
[00:47:46.940 --> 00:47:48.340]   First proper first-person shooter.
[00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:49.340]   What got it right?
[00:47:49.340 --> 00:47:50.340]   What did you think he said?
[00:47:50.340 --> 00:47:51.340]   Doom.
[00:47:51.340 --> 00:47:52.340]   Oh, Doom.
[00:47:52.340 --> 00:47:53.340]   Which was a RTS game based off of novels.
[00:47:53.340 --> 00:47:55.100]   I know we're making sure I've played both.
[00:47:55.100 --> 00:47:56.940]   I want to know what you were talking about.
[00:47:56.940 --> 00:47:57.940]   Doom, the game.
[00:47:57.940 --> 00:47:58.940]   Okay.
[00:47:58.940 --> 00:47:59.940]   It's not very good.
[00:47:59.940 --> 00:48:01.420]   Well, Doom, the film wasn't very good.
[00:48:01.420 --> 00:48:02.420]   I was shocked.
[00:48:02.420 --> 00:48:05.700]   I found out my wife had a crush on Sting when she was a teenager
[00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:09.060]   and had a picture of him in that Doom outfit on a wall.
[00:48:09.060 --> 00:48:10.060]   It really caught the lawyers.
[00:48:10.060 --> 00:48:11.060]   That was--
[00:48:11.060 --> 00:48:12.820]   I'm really sorry about this tangent.
[00:48:12.820 --> 00:48:15.340]   Doom, though, had a thing you're talking about.
[00:48:15.340 --> 00:48:16.340]   Doom, yeah.
[00:48:16.340 --> 00:48:18.100]   Doom-- no, no, no.
[00:48:18.100 --> 00:48:19.100]   Doom, uh, Doom.
[00:48:19.100 --> 00:48:22.420]   Doom, uh, was the original shareware game which made it work.
[00:48:22.420 --> 00:48:23.420]   ID software made--
[00:48:23.420 --> 00:48:24.420]   That's right.
[00:48:24.420 --> 00:48:25.420]   It was the very first one.
[00:48:25.420 --> 00:48:27.420]   I remember millions out of that by giving the game away.
[00:48:27.420 --> 00:48:28.420]   But they had done some stuff like that.
[00:48:28.420 --> 00:48:29.420]   They had Duke Nukem and--
[00:48:29.420 --> 00:48:32.860]   Well, they had done Wolfenstein before Doom, which was--
[00:48:32.860 --> 00:48:33.860]   There were a few other--
[00:48:33.860 --> 00:48:34.860]   Which kind of freaked away.
[00:48:34.860 --> 00:48:35.860]   Yeah.
[00:48:35.860 --> 00:48:38.500]   They basically ripped off an awful lot of stuff from another games
[00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:42.180]   company made Wolfenstein, then made Doom, which really worked
[00:48:42.180 --> 00:48:44.060]   and gave it away.
[00:48:44.060 --> 00:48:46.780]   And then Quake just dominated everything for a while.
[00:48:46.780 --> 00:48:49.020]   I have to say that's the first time I've heard the word shareware
[00:48:49.020 --> 00:48:50.020]   since 2001.
[00:48:50.020 --> 00:48:51.020]   Shh.
[00:48:51.020 --> 00:48:52.020]   I know.
[00:48:52.020 --> 00:48:53.020]   I'm updating myself on sites.
[00:48:53.020 --> 00:48:54.020]   It's--
[00:48:54.020 --> 00:48:55.260]   I mean, do you remember how it used to be that?
[00:48:55.260 --> 00:48:58.580]   I mean, I would get a cassette of software with--
[00:48:58.580 --> 00:49:01.820]   This is free, but if you want updates, send a-- send a
[00:49:01.820 --> 00:49:04.620]   fiver to this address and you just put a piece of a note
[00:49:04.620 --> 00:49:05.620]   of the thing--
[00:49:05.620 --> 00:49:06.620]   It was a note.
[00:49:06.620 --> 00:49:07.620]   The text file of the-- whatever.
[00:49:07.620 --> 00:49:08.620]   Yeah.
[00:49:08.620 --> 00:49:10.100]   And then you put it into a cassette player and fiddle around
[00:49:10.100 --> 00:49:12.020]   with a tone control and you finally got it to learn.
[00:49:12.020 --> 00:49:13.020]   So wait, wait, wait.
[00:49:13.020 --> 00:49:14.020]   So I have one more level.
[00:49:14.020 --> 00:49:16.260]   I mail a fiver, which is a British slang for a five pound
[00:49:16.260 --> 00:49:17.260]   note.
[00:49:17.260 --> 00:49:18.260]   Yeah.
[00:49:18.260 --> 00:49:19.260]   I mail it to them and then what comes back in the mail?
[00:49:19.260 --> 00:49:20.260]   Updates to the game.
[00:49:20.260 --> 00:49:21.260]   New levels.
[00:49:21.260 --> 00:49:22.260]   Another cassette.
[00:49:22.260 --> 00:49:23.260]   They mail in more cassettes.
[00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:24.260]   Yeah.
[00:49:24.260 --> 00:49:25.260]   Sorry.
[00:49:25.260 --> 00:49:27.060]   I'm not quite in this generation, so I'm learning.
[00:49:27.060 --> 00:49:29.060]   Just be happy you were born when you were.
[00:49:29.060 --> 00:49:30.060]   Yes, I know.
[00:49:30.060 --> 00:49:31.060]   You didn't miss a thing.
[00:49:31.060 --> 00:49:32.540]   I grew up with Dial Up and I thought that was old school.
[00:49:32.540 --> 00:49:34.260]   Have you ever seen an AOL CD?
[00:49:34.260 --> 00:49:35.260]   I grew up on the--
[00:49:35.260 --> 00:49:36.260]   Yeah, okay.
[00:49:36.260 --> 00:49:37.260]   You've seen sprisbees.
[00:49:37.260 --> 00:49:38.260]   Yeah.
[00:49:38.260 --> 00:49:40.620]   I'm convinced future archaeologists will find like--
[00:49:40.620 --> 00:49:42.780]   they'll name it the AOL level of all these--
[00:49:42.780 --> 00:49:43.780]   That's right.
[00:49:43.780 --> 00:49:47.220]   --in waste in landfill sites of just like layers upon layers
[00:49:47.220 --> 00:49:49.740]   of software which wants to get onto your PC.
[00:49:49.740 --> 00:49:52.260]   It's persistent at herpes and it's difficult to get rid of.
[00:49:52.260 --> 00:49:53.260]   But yes.
[00:49:53.260 --> 00:49:56.140]   I remember being members of the punch club card of the month.
[00:49:56.140 --> 00:49:57.140]   Punch card of the month.
[00:49:57.140 --> 00:49:58.140]   Oh, wow.
[00:49:58.140 --> 00:49:59.540]   You get a new punch card every month or the game on.
[00:49:59.540 --> 00:50:00.540]   No, you don't.
[00:50:00.540 --> 00:50:01.540]   No, you don't.
[00:50:01.540 --> 00:50:02.540]   That's a scam.
[00:50:02.540 --> 00:50:03.540]   I don't know.
[00:50:03.540 --> 00:50:05.540]   It was for the days.
[00:50:05.540 --> 00:50:08.100]   Because there were never enough personal punch card computers
[00:50:08.100 --> 00:50:09.100]   in the next business.
[00:50:09.100 --> 00:50:12.420]   Well, I had to buy a punch card reader for $38,000.
[00:50:12.420 --> 00:50:13.420]   But then--
[00:50:13.420 --> 00:50:14.780]   And a house to put it in too.
[00:50:14.780 --> 00:50:15.780]   --peppage farm.
[00:50:15.780 --> 00:50:16.780]   And an IBM.
[00:50:16.780 --> 00:50:17.780]   Yeah.
[00:50:17.780 --> 00:50:18.780]   Those are the days.
[00:50:18.780 --> 00:50:19.780]   That was a meme reference.
[00:50:19.780 --> 00:50:20.780]   I remember.
[00:50:20.780 --> 00:50:21.780]   Look at that.
[00:50:21.780 --> 00:50:22.780]   We're not over the hill yet, boys.
[00:50:22.780 --> 00:50:26.740]   Welcome for Stapel to stop selling the iPhone 7 and 8
[00:50:26.740 --> 00:50:27.740]   in Germany.
[00:50:27.740 --> 00:50:28.740]   Yeah.
[00:50:28.740 --> 00:50:29.740]   Qualcomm is an interesting case.
[00:50:29.740 --> 00:50:30.740]   It was an interesting case.
[00:50:30.740 --> 00:50:32.340]   It set aside $1.5 billion.
[00:50:32.340 --> 00:50:33.860]   I guess this is a requirement.
[00:50:33.860 --> 00:50:34.860]   Yeah.
[00:50:34.860 --> 00:50:37.500]   I said to them, if you really want to go ahead with this case,
[00:50:37.500 --> 00:50:40.460]   we're going to need to bond on the potential damages.
[00:50:40.460 --> 00:50:43.100]   And Apple lawyers were repeatedly just like,
[00:50:43.100 --> 00:50:44.460]   eee, that's the end of that.
[00:50:44.460 --> 00:50:45.620]   And then Qualcomm said, there you go.
[00:50:45.620 --> 00:50:47.100]   Here's your $1.5 billion.
[00:50:47.100 --> 00:50:48.740]   $1.5 billion.
[00:50:48.740 --> 00:50:51.780]   You know those Apple 10 sales are through the roof in Germany.
[00:50:51.780 --> 00:50:52.300]   Yeah.
[00:50:52.300 --> 00:50:53.420]   But you'd hope at least.
[00:50:53.420 --> 00:50:53.940]   Yeah.
[00:50:53.940 --> 00:50:55.820]   Because the 7 and 8, is that a big deal?
[00:50:55.820 --> 00:50:57.540]   In fact, I think they've even started to remove them
[00:50:57.540 --> 00:51:00.260]   from the stores in the US as well.
[00:51:00.260 --> 00:51:02.300]   However, Qualcomm is starting to make a little headway.
[00:51:02.300 --> 00:51:03.460]   On the other hand, Apple--
[00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:05.140]   It's really-- it's a crazy battle.
[00:51:05.140 --> 00:51:06.340]   It's been going on for years.
[00:51:06.340 --> 00:51:09.460]   Didn't Apple have a court victory with Qualcomm?
[00:51:09.460 --> 00:51:11.940]   This is where the world might turn to you guys and go,
[00:51:11.940 --> 00:51:13.260]   what happened in chips?
[00:51:13.260 --> 00:51:14.580]   You got to buy in very chips.
[00:51:14.580 --> 00:51:15.580]   Stupid.
[00:51:15.580 --> 00:51:18.260]   It all comes down to modem and licensing revenues.
[00:51:18.260 --> 00:51:20.780]   And both sides feel that they've been ripped off
[00:51:20.780 --> 00:51:21.580]   by the other side.
[00:51:21.580 --> 00:51:23.540]   And it's up to the courts to work out.
[00:51:23.540 --> 00:51:24.900]   Some of the lawyers will get fat.
[00:51:24.900 --> 00:51:27.540]   Someone will get about a $4, $500 million payout.
[00:51:27.540 --> 00:51:30.540]   And we'll go back to businesses as usual.
[00:51:30.540 --> 00:51:33.380]   But it's interesting to see the Qualcomm's market is--
[00:51:33.380 --> 00:51:35.620]   how many people it's pissing off an Apple,
[00:51:35.620 --> 00:51:37.020]   getting into bed with Intel?
[00:51:37.020 --> 00:51:41.660]   And Apple's going to be making its own radios.
[00:51:41.660 --> 00:51:42.140]   Oh, yeah.
[00:51:42.140 --> 00:51:43.420]   They're going to stop putting those chips in.
[00:51:43.420 --> 00:51:44.740]   So it's a problem that's going to go away eventually
[00:51:44.740 --> 00:51:46.100]   in terms of the relationship.
[00:51:46.100 --> 00:51:47.980]   But they're going to fight all the way through the divorce.
[00:51:47.980 --> 00:51:48.580]   Yes.
[00:51:48.580 --> 00:51:50.340]   So this is what I was trying to remember.
[00:51:50.340 --> 00:51:54.220]   The FTC is now suing Qualcomm.
[00:51:54.220 --> 00:51:57.220]   Because this all comes down-- it basically underscores
[00:51:57.220 --> 00:51:59.660]   Apple's position, which is the Qualcomm has patents,
[00:51:59.660 --> 00:52:03.220]   but they're not licensing them as friend, as fair,
[00:52:03.220 --> 00:52:04.580]   patents at a fair price.
[00:52:04.580 --> 00:52:05.660]   Very reasonable price.
[00:52:05.660 --> 00:52:06.420]   Yeah.
[00:52:06.420 --> 00:52:11.500]   So the FTC agrees, and they are going to court.
[00:52:11.500 --> 00:52:13.620]   They'll be facing Judge Lucico once again.
[00:52:13.620 --> 00:52:15.260]   Oh my gosh, the notorious.
[00:52:15.260 --> 00:52:16.060]   The notorious.
[00:52:16.060 --> 00:52:16.540]   Yes.
[00:52:16.540 --> 00:52:17.380]   She seems to get all of those--
[00:52:17.380 --> 00:52:20.500]   The notorious co, that sounds like a very bad rep.
[00:52:20.500 --> 00:52:22.420]   Notorious KOH, we call her.
[00:52:22.420 --> 00:52:22.860]   Yes.
[00:52:22.860 --> 00:52:23.300]   Yeah.
[00:52:23.300 --> 00:52:23.940]   Yes we do.
[00:52:23.940 --> 00:52:25.340]   Anyway, so that's a little--
[00:52:25.340 --> 00:52:28.140]   I mean, at least a moral victory for Apple,
[00:52:28.140 --> 00:52:29.740]   if you're not an actual victory.
[00:52:29.740 --> 00:52:31.900]   So this fight just is endless.
[00:52:31.900 --> 00:52:33.660]   But ultimately, that's what it comes down to,
[00:52:33.660 --> 00:52:36.820]   is that Qualcomm has all these patents,
[00:52:36.820 --> 00:52:40.220]   particularly for outdated technologies like CDMA.
[00:52:40.220 --> 00:52:42.900]   All of this will go away, I presume, with 5G, although--
[00:52:42.900 --> 00:52:45.540]   I think they've been snapping up 5G patents as well.
[00:52:45.540 --> 00:52:47.540]   And they are charging a lot of money
[00:52:47.540 --> 00:52:50.380]   to Apple and others for the right to make phones that
[00:52:50.380 --> 00:52:52.780]   support these radios and these technologies,
[00:52:52.780 --> 00:52:54.060]   whether they use Qualcomm chips or not.
[00:52:54.060 --> 00:52:56.620]   It's classic technology rent-seeking.
[00:52:56.620 --> 00:52:57.460]   That's not again.
[00:52:57.460 --> 00:52:58.540]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:52:58.540 --> 00:53:01.700]   Companies like Qualcomm, component manufacturers,
[00:53:01.700 --> 00:53:04.420]   have all sort of-- that's all moved to China long ago.
[00:53:04.420 --> 00:53:07.180]   And so they're sort of like the base in San Diego, I think.
[00:53:07.180 --> 00:53:07.700]   Yeah.
[00:53:07.700 --> 00:53:10.140]   And they're just fighting tooth and nail to stay alive
[00:53:10.140 --> 00:53:13.940]   in a world that really wants their business to go to either
[00:53:13.940 --> 00:53:16.300]   companies like Apple or to Asian manufacturers.
[00:53:16.300 --> 00:53:17.900]   I was going to say that the Chinese manufacturers are now
[00:53:17.900 --> 00:53:19.500]   making all their own stuff as well.
[00:53:19.500 --> 00:53:20.100]   So they--
[00:53:20.100 --> 00:53:22.380]   Yeah, but they're winning in China.
[00:53:22.380 --> 00:53:23.260]   They won in China.
[00:53:23.260 --> 00:53:26.500]   They just won in Germany.
[00:53:26.500 --> 00:53:29.060]   In many cases, I mean, they have the patents.
[00:53:29.060 --> 00:53:31.420]   They did invent these fundamental technologies
[00:53:31.420 --> 00:53:33.740]   that dispute now is whether they're asking
[00:53:33.740 --> 00:53:34.860]   a reasonable amount of money.
[00:53:34.860 --> 00:53:36.380]   I was going to say, I mean, you can say, well,
[00:53:36.380 --> 00:53:39.340]   you invented the technology, but 30 years down the line,
[00:53:39.340 --> 00:53:41.900]   does that still give you the right to rip off the--
[00:53:41.900 --> 00:53:42.740]   Apple says no.
[00:53:42.740 --> 00:53:43.620]   Apple's refusing to pay.
[00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:44.220]   I agree with this.
[00:53:44.220 --> 00:53:45.660]   It's one of a few anti-capitalist views.
[00:53:45.660 --> 00:53:47.140]   I think if you invent something, you should have it
[00:53:47.140 --> 00:53:48.460]   for even a quarter century.
[00:53:48.460 --> 00:53:51.020]   But at some point in time, let it go.
[00:53:51.020 --> 00:53:55.500]   But isn't this Chinese chip pushed under their China 2025
[00:53:55.500 --> 00:53:56.020]   overall--
[00:53:56.020 --> 00:53:58.340]   Basically, they want to be self-sufficient in technologies
[00:53:58.340 --> 00:54:01.020]   that they're not going to have to rely on.
[00:54:01.020 --> 00:54:03.420]   Because this is the problem ZD had last year.
[00:54:03.420 --> 00:54:04.460]   Oh, ZTE in America.
[00:54:04.460 --> 00:54:04.980]   Yeah.
[00:54:04.980 --> 00:54:05.980]   Sorry.
[00:54:05.980 --> 00:54:06.980]   You're totally ZTE.
[00:54:06.980 --> 00:54:09.260]   I'm just translating for you from well, ZTE.
[00:54:09.260 --> 00:54:09.820]   Yeah.
[00:54:09.820 --> 00:54:11.540]   Well, that's well for ZTE.
[00:54:11.540 --> 00:54:12.540]   It is pronounced.
[00:54:12.540 --> 00:54:14.180]   That was just trying to be rude.
[00:54:14.180 --> 00:54:16.100]   He's from Derbyshire.
[00:54:16.100 --> 00:54:17.260]   Derbyshire.
[00:54:17.260 --> 00:54:17.740]   Yeah.
[00:54:17.740 --> 00:54:20.900]   So, but yeah, I mean, they do want to be self-sufficient,
[00:54:20.900 --> 00:54:22.700]   and they will be.
[00:54:22.700 --> 00:54:26.420]   And I mean, I was talking to an old Intel hand.
[00:54:26.420 --> 00:54:28.980]   But when Intel started shifting production out there,
[00:54:28.980 --> 00:54:30.220]   they were just like, yeah, we know
[00:54:30.220 --> 00:54:31.500]   they're going to rip off our technology.
[00:54:31.500 --> 00:54:33.860]   But we'll keep the good stuff outside China
[00:54:33.860 --> 00:54:35.700]   and just use China for the volume stuff.
[00:54:35.700 --> 00:54:38.180]   This all falls back to me into the kind of the bifurcation
[00:54:38.180 --> 00:54:40.940]   of the tech world into closed systems and open systems
[00:54:40.940 --> 00:54:41.940]   at the country level.
[00:54:41.940 --> 00:54:43.260]   China has their own internet.
[00:54:43.260 --> 00:54:44.340]   They want their own chips.
[00:54:44.340 --> 00:54:45.420]   They want their own IP.
[00:54:45.420 --> 00:54:47.820]   They have their own internet giants, et cetera, et cetera, et
[00:54:47.820 --> 00:54:48.020]   cetera.
[00:54:48.020 --> 00:54:50.940]   They're building a nation state of technology
[00:54:50.940 --> 00:54:52.980]   that we in the West increasingly
[00:54:52.980 --> 00:54:54.620]   don't want to interface with or can't
[00:54:54.620 --> 00:54:55.740]   give security concerns.
[00:54:55.740 --> 00:54:57.420]   And I don't think it's healthy long term.
[00:54:57.420 --> 00:55:00.100]   I think technology thrives on big open markets.
[00:55:00.100 --> 00:55:01.300]   And I don't think this is going to be
[00:55:01.300 --> 00:55:03.820]   to the long term credit of the Chinese economy.
[00:55:03.820 --> 00:55:06.100]   That's my macro view.
[00:55:06.100 --> 00:55:07.820]   I think it's too bad that we're moving backwards.
[00:55:07.820 --> 00:55:10.420]   It seems in terms of openness and sharing
[00:55:10.420 --> 00:55:11.340]   across international borders.
[00:55:11.340 --> 00:55:13.780]   I think China's taken the view that we've got 1.2 billion
[00:55:13.780 --> 00:55:14.340]   consumers.
[00:55:14.340 --> 00:55:16.420]   America's got 400 million.
[00:55:16.420 --> 00:55:17.500]   We're fine.
[00:55:17.500 --> 00:55:20.540]   It's America that's in trouble over this one.
[00:55:20.540 --> 00:55:22.260]   I mean, I have-- this is complicated.
[00:55:22.260 --> 00:55:23.340]   This is a difficult one.
[00:55:23.340 --> 00:55:25.620]   I have read several times, and I've talked to people
[00:55:25.620 --> 00:55:29.900]   who think that China's interests are hard to understand
[00:55:29.900 --> 00:55:32.860]   because while they want total and ultimate control
[00:55:32.860 --> 00:55:35.220]   within the country, they are very much global.
[00:55:35.220 --> 00:55:37.780]   And globalism is very good for them economically.
[00:55:37.780 --> 00:55:39.420]   That's why the Belt and Road Initiative--
[00:55:39.420 --> 00:55:40.340]   That's very much so.
[00:55:40.340 --> 00:55:45.180]   And so they would like to be a world economic power
[00:55:45.180 --> 00:55:47.900]   and play and trade and have open trade
[00:55:47.900 --> 00:55:51.540]   while they are very backward in terms of their people,
[00:55:51.540 --> 00:55:52.100]   their own people.
[00:55:52.100 --> 00:55:54.340]   They're very authoritarian with their own people.
[00:55:54.340 --> 00:55:55.700]   Well, I mean, increasingly so, actually.
[00:55:55.700 --> 00:55:56.180]   Yeah.
[00:55:56.180 --> 00:55:56.660]   Yeah.
[00:55:56.660 --> 00:55:58.100]   I mean, I read a story-- I'm sorry.
[00:55:58.100 --> 00:56:00.420]   It's just on the side to support that point.
[00:56:00.420 --> 00:56:02.380]   Now there are school children in some school districts
[00:56:02.380 --> 00:56:06.180]   in China that have smart uniforms that track the children.
[00:56:06.180 --> 00:56:07.980]   And they match the face recognition
[00:56:07.980 --> 00:56:09.500]   when they enter the school room to make sure
[00:56:09.500 --> 00:56:12.220]   that the child who's supposed to be wearing that particular uniform
[00:56:12.220 --> 00:56:13.620]   is, in fact, wearing that uniform.
[00:56:13.620 --> 00:56:15.860]   So the tracking is actually tracking the child.
[00:56:15.860 --> 00:56:17.460]   They think that they're tracking.
[00:56:17.460 --> 00:56:19.660]   And then, last of my time, are they late?
[00:56:19.660 --> 00:56:23.340]   Or is this sort of like a totalitarian or well-ian system
[00:56:23.340 --> 00:56:25.620]   within the elementary school?
[00:56:25.620 --> 00:56:27.620]   And it feeds into probably the social credit system.
[00:56:27.620 --> 00:56:29.700]   It's kind of spinning around the nation.
[00:56:29.700 --> 00:56:31.300]   But normally, when you think of Orwell,
[00:56:31.300 --> 00:56:35.060]   you think of a country building walls, right, and going inward.
[00:56:35.060 --> 00:56:36.380]   And that's what's so interesting about this,
[00:56:36.380 --> 00:56:39.700]   because they are not going inward in terms of their economy.
[00:56:39.700 --> 00:56:40.860]   Well, exactly.
[00:56:40.860 --> 00:56:43.740]   But culturally, they kind of are, I mean, to a certain extent.
[00:56:43.740 --> 00:56:48.620]   I mean, there's some desire to have Chinese culture more
[00:56:48.620 --> 00:56:50.660]   broadly appreciated internationally.
[00:56:50.660 --> 00:56:52.900]   But most of their activity internationally
[00:56:52.900 --> 00:56:58.420]   is about getting resources to fuel this enormous economy
[00:56:58.420 --> 00:57:00.660]   with all these enormous numbers of people,
[00:57:00.660 --> 00:57:02.140]   which is kind of necessary.
[00:57:02.140 --> 00:57:05.580]   Because, I mean, back in the day when Chinese people
[00:57:05.580 --> 00:57:08.340]   used to mostly ride bicycles and so on,
[00:57:08.340 --> 00:57:11.220]   it was like the resource demands were not that great.
[00:57:11.220 --> 00:57:13.700]   Now, everybody wants the American dream in China.
[00:57:13.700 --> 00:57:15.940]   Which is why the African push is going on.
[00:57:15.940 --> 00:57:17.780]   Well, that's been going on for two decades now.
[00:57:17.780 --> 00:57:19.300]   But one last thing before we take a break,
[00:57:19.300 --> 00:57:23.180]   but Leo, you said they want to go externally, economically,
[00:57:23.180 --> 00:57:24.140]   not entirely true.
[00:57:24.140 --> 00:57:26.260]   They've been moving away from an export based economy
[00:57:26.260 --> 00:57:28.820]   for some time and trying to build a domestic consumption
[00:57:28.820 --> 00:57:29.540]   based economy.
[00:57:29.540 --> 00:57:30.300]   Oh, interesting.
[00:57:30.300 --> 00:57:32.060]   Which is why the last two quarters of slipping data
[00:57:32.060 --> 00:57:33.460]   on the consumption side of the Chinese economy
[00:57:33.460 --> 00:57:34.940]   has been so scary to people.
[00:57:34.940 --> 00:57:37.100]   Because tax revenues and it's a huge mess.
[00:57:37.100 --> 00:57:40.340]   So I think this is not the China show, so I should shut up.
[00:57:40.340 --> 00:57:42.540]   But I think there's a lot here from the tech side
[00:57:42.540 --> 00:57:44.700]   that we need to pay attention to in the next couple of years.
[00:57:44.700 --> 00:57:46.380]   Because this topic is not going away.
[00:57:46.380 --> 00:57:48.820]   Increasingly, we are watching with interest to see
[00:57:48.820 --> 00:57:51.460]   China's going to leapfrog us in AI.
[00:57:51.460 --> 00:57:53.820]   China's because the government's way ahead of us in AI.
[00:57:53.820 --> 00:57:55.340]   Why ahead of us in AI?
[00:57:55.340 --> 00:57:56.340]   On this.
[00:57:56.340 --> 00:57:57.660]   They're a lot of technology.
[00:57:57.660 --> 00:57:58.780]   They're not taking the quantum.
[00:57:58.780 --> 00:57:59.860]   Yeah.
[00:57:59.860 --> 00:58:02.780]   In terms of space, they've just landed it's done the first--
[00:58:02.780 --> 00:58:03.540]   Dark side of the moon?
[00:58:03.540 --> 00:58:05.020]   On the far side of the moon.
[00:58:05.020 --> 00:58:06.540]   Please not the dark side of the moon.
[00:58:06.540 --> 00:58:07.020]   Wait a minute.
[00:58:07.020 --> 00:58:08.180]   You can't call it the dark side?
[00:58:08.180 --> 00:58:09.540]   No, because it's not dark.
[00:58:09.540 --> 00:58:10.060]   Oh, OK.
[00:58:10.060 --> 00:58:10.580]   It's a pink Floyd.
[00:58:10.580 --> 00:58:11.220]   It's dark to us.
[00:58:11.220 --> 00:58:11.740]   OK.
[00:58:11.740 --> 00:58:12.580]   It's dark to us.
[00:58:12.580 --> 00:58:13.420]   It's a great thing.
[00:58:13.420 --> 00:58:15.860]   You don't see the other side, but there's a sun there, right?
[00:58:15.860 --> 00:58:18.020]   But that-- no, that's why it was called the dark side.
[00:58:18.020 --> 00:58:19.900]   Like in Darkest Africa, where you didn't actually
[00:58:19.900 --> 00:58:20.700]   know what was there.
[00:58:20.700 --> 00:58:21.900]   But technically, it's the far side.
[00:58:21.900 --> 00:58:23.820]   I've been arguing with readers about this goal.
[00:58:23.820 --> 00:58:25.260]   Also a great cartoon in the far side.
[00:58:25.260 --> 00:58:25.780]   Fantastic.
[00:58:25.780 --> 00:58:26.300]   Fantastic.
[00:58:26.300 --> 00:58:26.300]   Fantastic.
[00:58:26.300 --> 00:58:26.800]   Fantastic.
[00:58:26.800 --> 00:58:28.140]   But a great album in the dark side of the moon.
[00:58:28.140 --> 00:58:29.140]   So--
[00:58:29.140 --> 00:58:30.140]   Yeah.
[00:58:30.140 --> 00:58:30.660]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:58:30.660 --> 00:58:33.620]   It's interesting, though, that we had an AI conference where
[00:58:33.620 --> 00:58:36.260]   at the end of last year where they were saying, yeah, well,
[00:58:36.260 --> 00:58:38.340]   America's filed more patents in AI
[00:58:38.340 --> 00:58:39.540]   than any other station.
[00:58:39.540 --> 00:58:41.900]   Yeah, the fact that the Chinese are actually--
[00:58:41.900 --> 00:58:45.220]   sorry, has filed more papers, academic papers about AI.
[00:58:45.220 --> 00:58:46.940]   The fact that Chinese haven't done as many
[00:58:46.940 --> 00:58:48.460]   as they do, doesn't mean they're not producing
[00:58:48.460 --> 00:58:49.820]   the amount of stuff they're just not publishing.
[00:58:49.820 --> 00:58:52.340]   And it doesn't mean they're not memorizing all the papers
[00:58:52.340 --> 00:58:53.220]   that the US has published.
[00:58:53.220 --> 00:58:53.700]   Exactly.
[00:58:53.700 --> 00:58:56.380]   And there's also-- this feeds in another story
[00:58:56.380 --> 00:58:58.220]   that I don't know if it's on the rundown or not.
[00:58:58.220 --> 00:59:00.820]   But it's basically the Commerce Department wants to--
[00:59:00.820 --> 00:59:01.340]   Yes.
[00:59:01.340 --> 00:59:03.460]   --is considering the limitation-- it is on the rundown--
[00:59:03.460 --> 00:59:06.260]   the limitation of AI technology exports,
[00:59:06.260 --> 00:59:07.740]   including a number of other things.
[00:59:07.740 --> 00:59:08.780]   And this is a dumb--
[00:59:08.780 --> 00:59:10.740]   I personally think it's a dumb idea because--
[00:59:10.740 --> 00:59:11.180]   Yes.
[00:59:11.180 --> 00:59:16.620]   --basically, the idea that China will just raise its hands,
[00:59:16.620 --> 00:59:19.580]   go, well, I guess we have no access to the US AI technology.
[00:59:19.580 --> 00:59:20.900]   I mean, the students are here.
[00:59:20.900 --> 00:59:24.740]   They're Chinese citizens who work for corporations in the US.
[00:59:24.740 --> 00:59:25.540]   I mean, if you look at--
[00:59:25.540 --> 00:59:28.500]   In the sciences, a huge number of researchers
[00:59:28.500 --> 00:59:31.260]   in almost all fields, including computer science,
[00:59:31.260 --> 00:59:35.580]   are Chinese nationals who have come to this country recently.
[00:59:35.580 --> 00:59:37.740]   They have this policy in China called the Thousand
[00:59:37.740 --> 00:59:40.380]   Grays of Rice, where if you return your academic
[00:59:40.380 --> 00:59:42.780]   and you work in AI, you will have a long meeting
[00:59:42.780 --> 00:59:45.540]   with some people-- nice people from the government--
[00:59:45.540 --> 00:59:47.700]   who will start to work on you about what's going on,
[00:59:47.700 --> 00:59:48.820]   who's doing what.
[00:59:48.820 --> 00:59:51.260]   And they have a way of putting a lot of pressure on you
[00:59:51.260 --> 00:59:52.620]   and your family and all this kind of stuff.
[00:59:52.620 --> 00:59:55.740]   So they're going to get this either through exports,
[00:59:55.740 --> 00:59:57.300]   or they're going to get it through students,
[00:59:57.300 --> 00:59:58.980]   or they're going to get it through consumers,
[00:59:58.980 --> 01:00:00.700]   or they're going to get it the old-fashioned way--
[01:00:00.700 --> 01:00:02.180]   corporate espionage.
[01:00:02.180 --> 01:00:04.660]   So there's no need to limit our exports of this stuff itself.
[01:00:04.660 --> 01:00:05.100]   Defeating.
[01:00:05.100 --> 01:00:08.700]   All it does is it gives US AI companies
[01:00:08.700 --> 01:00:10.340]   a disadvantage in the global marketplace.
[01:00:10.340 --> 01:00:11.460]   They'll be buying Chinese tech.
[01:00:11.460 --> 01:00:12.340]   And how does that help us?
[01:00:12.340 --> 01:00:14.780]   It does provide a nice headline to a current anti-China
[01:00:14.780 --> 01:00:17.220]   administration we have for the executive branch.
[01:00:17.220 --> 01:00:19.060]   But again, not a political show.
[01:00:19.060 --> 01:00:20.860]   I would say with a caveat to what you were saying,
[01:00:20.860 --> 01:00:23.420]   yes, OK, there's espionage and the yesterday there's students.
[01:00:23.420 --> 01:00:26.500]   There's also a terrific amount of very well-funded,
[01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:28.420]   pure research being done in China.
[01:00:28.420 --> 01:00:30.740]   If you look at, particularly, in terms of quantum communications
[01:00:30.740 --> 01:00:33.540]   and those sort of areas, they are leaps and bounds ahead
[01:00:33.540 --> 01:00:35.460]   because they've invested the money in academics,
[01:00:35.460 --> 01:00:38.060]   and they've done the pure research that's needed.
[01:00:38.060 --> 01:00:40.580]   And something America is very bad at
[01:00:40.580 --> 01:00:43.100]   is funding this long-term, pure research,
[01:00:43.100 --> 01:00:46.300]   rather than going for short-term commercially viable stuff.
[01:00:46.300 --> 01:00:48.380]   So the Commerce Department is taking comments.
[01:00:48.380 --> 01:00:50.980]   They will make a decision on January 10.
[01:00:50.980 --> 01:00:54.260]   This comes from a bill passed in August by Congress,
[01:00:54.260 --> 01:00:57.580]   the Export Controls Act of 2018, which
[01:00:57.580 --> 01:01:00.660]   allowed the government to restrict exports
[01:01:00.660 --> 01:01:03.060]   of emerging and foundational technologies.
[01:01:03.060 --> 01:01:04.460]   Including voice.
[01:01:04.460 --> 01:01:07.260]   And so you would think, I mean, oh, the Chinese
[01:01:07.260 --> 01:01:08.140]   are stealing it from us.
[01:01:08.140 --> 01:01:09.300]   They're cheating.
[01:01:09.300 --> 01:01:11.500]   We should keep them from this stuff.
[01:01:11.500 --> 01:01:13.860]   But in fact, academics are worried because,
[01:01:13.860 --> 01:01:16.900]   A, you can't control the export of this stuff.
[01:01:16.900 --> 01:01:18.180]   You can't control.
[01:01:18.180 --> 01:01:21.700]   And a law like this will actually hurt us more
[01:01:21.700 --> 01:01:25.780]   than would hurt the Chinese because we won't get the information.
[01:01:25.780 --> 01:01:29.300]   A Chinese will anyway, and that means we will become--
[01:01:29.300 --> 01:01:30.740]   we will fall behind in a little description.
[01:01:30.740 --> 01:01:31.740]   I mean, that is expecting Russian answer
[01:01:31.740 --> 01:01:32.820]   from the Commerce Department, which
[01:01:32.820 --> 01:01:34.180]   is a bit of a hard push at the moment.
[01:01:34.180 --> 01:01:36.100]   But it's hard because, you know, on the face of it,
[01:01:36.100 --> 01:01:38.060]   the surface of it sounds like, well, yeah,
[01:01:38.060 --> 01:01:40.620]   we shouldn't be giving them our keys to the kingdom here.
[01:01:40.620 --> 01:01:42.580]   We should hold those close to the vest.
[01:01:42.580 --> 01:01:45.340]   But that's based on a false notion.
[01:01:45.340 --> 01:01:47.900]   It's widely held in Washington, that false notion, which
[01:01:47.900 --> 01:01:52.140]   is that if we don't share technology, technology will stop.
[01:01:52.140 --> 01:01:53.540]   Technology won't stop.
[01:01:53.540 --> 01:01:55.460]   All this stuff is inevitable.
[01:01:55.460 --> 01:01:58.540]   It's perfectly inevitable that really advanced AI
[01:01:58.540 --> 01:02:02.060]   will go completely global over the next 10, 20, 30, 40 years.
[01:02:02.060 --> 01:02:03.580]   And all that will happen is we won't have access to it.
[01:02:03.580 --> 01:02:05.340]   Either we're involved in it or we're not.
[01:02:05.340 --> 01:02:06.900]   And so it's like, take your pick.
[01:02:06.900 --> 01:02:07.740]   It's happening.
[01:02:07.740 --> 01:02:09.780]   Open systems, be closed systems.
[01:02:09.780 --> 01:02:12.180]   And take part in the open system and the long term.
[01:02:12.180 --> 01:02:13.980]   It'll lead to the benefit of our country.
[01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:14.620]   Period.
[01:02:14.620 --> 01:02:18.820]   And I didn't mention, though, that Fortnite made--
[01:02:18.820 --> 01:02:21.740]   or Epic made $3 billion on Fortnite this year.
[01:02:21.740 --> 01:02:27.700]   Ninja, the e-sports champion, the number one e-sports guy who's
[01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:30.420]   the king of Fortnite players, says he made--
[01:02:30.420 --> 01:02:33.580]   told CNN he made $10 million this year, playing Fortnite.
[01:02:33.580 --> 01:02:35.100]   I mean, he's got an enormous--
[01:02:35.100 --> 01:02:35.940]   he's a celebrity.
[01:02:35.940 --> 01:02:37.820]   So when your mom says, what are you
[01:02:37.820 --> 01:02:39.380]   going to do, play video games for a living--
[01:02:39.380 --> 01:02:40.980]   I was going to say, I'm so peeved.
[01:02:40.980 --> 01:02:42.980]   This is exactly what my parents were telling me 20 years ago.
[01:02:42.980 --> 01:02:43.980]   He was wrong.
[01:02:43.980 --> 01:02:46.180]   I was just a little way down the timeline.
[01:02:46.180 --> 01:02:46.580]   I could--
[01:02:46.580 --> 01:02:47.300]   It's better than you think.
[01:02:47.300 --> 01:02:50.660]   There is a far side comic from decades ago that
[01:02:50.660 --> 01:02:53.260]   shows parents looking at a television ad--
[01:02:53.260 --> 01:02:55.220]   a certain ad in the paper where the child plays games
[01:02:55.220 --> 01:02:56.620]   and it says, can you see it at the princess?
[01:02:56.620 --> 01:02:58.740]   $50,000 a year plus retirement.
[01:02:58.740 --> 01:02:59.820]   And so they were joking about how
[01:02:59.820 --> 01:03:02.780]   vidigants could become an actual living.
[01:03:02.780 --> 01:03:04.540]   And then decades later on, far side
[01:03:04.540 --> 01:03:06.500]   was prescient, as opposed to rude.
[01:03:06.500 --> 01:03:06.980]   Yeah.
[01:03:06.980 --> 01:03:08.540]   Not surprised.
[01:03:08.540 --> 01:03:11.700]   I think Gary Larson was very--
[01:03:11.700 --> 01:03:12.540]   Is he alive?
[01:03:12.540 --> 01:03:13.540]   Oh, yeah.
[01:03:13.540 --> 01:03:15.220]   He basically doesn't allow--
[01:03:15.220 --> 01:03:16.340]   he's in total retirement.
[01:03:16.340 --> 01:03:19.020]   He doesn't do public appearances, doesn't really
[01:03:19.020 --> 01:03:20.700]   even want his face online at all.
[01:03:20.700 --> 01:03:21.620]   Good for him.
[01:03:21.620 --> 01:03:23.660]   Yeah, because basically he did it until he felt it stopped
[01:03:23.660 --> 01:03:26.260]   being funny and then retired to spend all time with his money.
[01:03:26.260 --> 01:03:28.980]   It is September 2nd, 2005.
[01:03:28.980 --> 01:03:31.180]   Actually, the comic is from much earlier, I'm sure.
[01:03:31.180 --> 01:03:32.300]   Yes, it is.
[01:03:32.300 --> 01:03:35.780]   Nintendo expert needed $50,000 salary plus bonus.
[01:03:35.780 --> 01:03:39.180]   Looking for good Mario Brothers player, $100,000.
[01:03:39.180 --> 01:03:40.340]   Can you save the princess?
[01:03:40.340 --> 01:03:42.860]   We need skilled men and women, $75,000.
[01:03:42.860 --> 01:03:44.500]   OK, I don't remember it correctly.
[01:03:44.500 --> 01:03:45.460]   Who's the gay boy?
[01:03:45.460 --> 01:03:47.180]   Hopeful parents.
[01:03:47.180 --> 01:03:48.500]   The stupid backwards hat.
[01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:48.980]   Yeah.
[01:03:48.980 --> 01:03:52.340]   But see, he's not saying this is going to happen.
[01:03:52.340 --> 01:03:52.780]   No, no.
[01:03:52.780 --> 01:03:54.700]   He's saying parents are wishing this would happen
[01:03:54.700 --> 01:03:56.260]   because my kid is so dopey.
[01:03:56.260 --> 01:03:57.220]   Right.
[01:03:57.220 --> 01:03:59.580]   This was a joke about how gaming was stupid.
[01:03:59.580 --> 01:04:01.180]   And then it became true decades.
[01:04:01.180 --> 01:04:02.180]   It's true.
[01:04:02.180 --> 01:04:04.860]   I was just wondering, I was looking to a piece last year
[01:04:04.860 --> 01:04:09.100]   where the US Navy used to have these special controllers
[01:04:09.100 --> 01:04:12.940]   for their periscopes, which cost like $15,000 a piece.
[01:04:12.940 --> 01:04:15.460]   And they've just replaced them with Xbox controllers.
[01:04:15.460 --> 01:04:17.540]   On those modern ships, they've got Xbox controllers.
[01:04:17.540 --> 01:04:18.300]   Exactly.
[01:04:18.300 --> 01:04:20.020]   And also because the generation of sailors
[01:04:20.020 --> 01:04:21.620]   using them grew up with these controllers.
[01:04:21.620 --> 01:04:23.180]   They've got overdeveloped thumbs.
[01:04:23.180 --> 01:04:24.460]   They're really powerful.
[01:04:24.460 --> 01:04:26.180]   The Army also has these tanks where
[01:04:26.180 --> 01:04:28.340]   there's a gun on a turret on top of the tank
[01:04:28.340 --> 01:04:30.100]   and it's controlled electronically.
[01:04:30.100 --> 01:04:31.940]   And they just get the latest 18-year-old kid.
[01:04:31.940 --> 01:04:33.180]   And they're like, OK, go ahead.
[01:04:33.180 --> 01:04:34.100]   Just pretend I didn't--
[01:04:34.100 --> 01:04:35.340]   You know what Call of Duty is?
[01:04:35.340 --> 01:04:36.740]   Get up there.
[01:04:36.740 --> 01:04:38.860]   Yeah, if I were a conspiracy theorist,
[01:04:38.860 --> 01:04:40.380]   I would just be all over this one.
[01:04:40.380 --> 01:04:42.340]   This has been the plan for the last 30 years.
[01:04:42.340 --> 01:04:43.500]   They don't encourage them.
[01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:45.700]   Well, I mean, who-- what was the game called?
[01:04:45.700 --> 01:04:49.220]   The US Army actually developed a first-person shooter.
[01:04:49.220 --> 01:04:51.340]   There's also a bad TV series about that
[01:04:51.340 --> 01:04:53.620]   where the people from the future come and get this gamer
[01:04:53.620 --> 01:04:54.900]   because he's like the best, you know, in the--
[01:04:54.900 --> 01:04:56.580]   Oh, I know there's a film.
[01:04:56.580 --> 01:04:59.500]   The Last Starfighter.
[01:04:59.500 --> 01:05:00.020]   Yeah.
[01:05:00.020 --> 01:05:00.500]   Something like that.
[01:05:00.500 --> 01:05:01.660]   And the group toys--
[01:05:01.660 --> 01:05:03.580]   Involves children playing games that are actually
[01:05:03.580 --> 01:05:05.780]   powering real tanks that don't know are real.
[01:05:05.780 --> 01:05:08.300]   Yeah, don't tell us the story, but I
[01:05:08.300 --> 01:05:10.180]   think it's called Ender's Game.
[01:05:10.180 --> 01:05:12.740]   That's a different movie, but is also a similar point.
[01:05:12.740 --> 01:05:13.580]   Yeah.
[01:05:13.580 --> 01:05:17.860]   Our show today brought to you by my shiny, clean, sweet,
[01:05:17.860 --> 01:05:22.140]   smelling smile because I use quip.
[01:05:22.140 --> 01:05:24.020]   Quip, I love quip.
[01:05:24.020 --> 01:05:25.860]   My daughter, the other day-- I was so proud of her.
[01:05:25.860 --> 01:05:26.860]   This was about five months ago.
[01:05:26.860 --> 01:05:29.620]   She said, "Dad, I think I need to brush my teeth more."
[01:05:29.620 --> 01:05:30.580]   I said, "Darling, you do."
[01:05:30.580 --> 01:05:32.700]   She said, "I want to get an electric toothbrush."
[01:05:32.700 --> 01:05:34.220]   I said, "Darling, it's done."
[01:05:34.220 --> 01:05:37.820]   And I had a quip subscription for her by the end of the day.
[01:05:37.820 --> 01:05:40.700]   Starting a healthy routine and sticking to it
[01:05:40.700 --> 01:05:42.060]   are two very different things.
[01:05:42.060 --> 01:05:47.340]   I know you'd like to brush better in 2019.
[01:05:47.340 --> 01:05:49.340]   Don't use that tired old toothbrush.
[01:05:49.340 --> 01:05:51.220]   Get yourself a quip.
[01:05:51.220 --> 01:05:52.740]   Quip is a better electric toothbrush.
[01:05:52.740 --> 01:05:55.980]   I just got my quip refill, by the way, yesterday.
[01:05:55.980 --> 01:05:58.460]   It had a new head because you have to replace that head
[01:05:58.460 --> 01:05:59.660]   every three months automatically.
[01:05:59.660 --> 01:06:00.860]   They send you the new head.
[01:06:00.860 --> 01:06:04.380]   It had a tube of toothpaste.
[01:06:04.380 --> 01:06:06.060]   And it had a battery in it.
[01:06:06.060 --> 01:06:07.980]   Because quip is the only electric toothbrush
[01:06:07.980 --> 01:06:08.820]   that doesn't plug in.
[01:06:08.820 --> 01:06:10.140]   It's a great travel toothbrush.
[01:06:10.140 --> 01:06:14.700]   It uses a single battery, a AAA battery.
[01:06:14.700 --> 01:06:17.380]   90% of us do not brush right.
[01:06:17.380 --> 01:06:18.660]   Did you know that?
[01:06:18.660 --> 01:06:20.580]   I didn't know that.
[01:06:20.580 --> 01:06:22.140]   Let me ask you, Mr. Dennel--
[01:06:22.140 --> 01:06:25.540]   Yes, everybody, you're going to ask the British about health.
[01:06:25.540 --> 01:06:28.020]   Did you know you should brush for a full two minutes?
[01:06:28.020 --> 01:06:30.420]   I just keep the big book of British smiles
[01:06:30.420 --> 01:06:33.860]   and the cool little matter reminds me to put it in.
[01:06:33.860 --> 01:06:35.340]   They have a little timer in the quip.
[01:06:35.340 --> 01:06:36.700]   It pulses every 30 seconds.
[01:06:36.700 --> 01:06:39.060]   So you can do four quadrants, two minutes.
[01:06:39.060 --> 01:06:40.380]   And then it stops.
[01:06:40.380 --> 01:06:40.900]   It's great.
[01:06:40.900 --> 01:06:42.620]   The cover, I love the multi-use cover
[01:06:42.620 --> 01:06:44.900]   because it could be a stand, but it also
[01:06:44.900 --> 01:06:47.300]   has a stick on the back so you can mount it to a mirror.
[01:06:47.300 --> 01:06:49.180]   So you never forget to brush because it's right there
[01:06:49.180 --> 01:06:50.940]   in your mirror in the bathroom.
[01:06:50.940 --> 01:06:53.220]   It slides over your bristles when you want to travel.
[01:06:53.220 --> 01:06:54.860]   You put a head down.
[01:06:54.860 --> 01:06:56.340]   And it protects your quip on the grow.
[01:06:56.340 --> 01:06:59.540]   Plus, it declutters the sink and makes traveling easier.
[01:06:59.540 --> 01:07:01.500]   No wires, no clunky charger.
[01:07:01.500 --> 01:07:03.340]   It goes three months on a battery charger.
[01:07:03.340 --> 01:07:05.500]   Brush heads automatically come on the dentist recommended
[01:07:05.500 --> 01:07:06.740]   schedule every three months.
[01:07:06.740 --> 01:07:08.420]   And that's just $5.
[01:07:08.420 --> 01:07:10.540]   Did you know more statistics--
[01:07:10.540 --> 01:07:14.980]   75% of us use old worn out bristles that aren't doing the job
[01:07:14.980 --> 01:07:16.500]   because we don't change our brush head?
[01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:17.420]   Who remembers, right?
[01:07:17.420 --> 01:07:21.100]   Yeah, I keep my toothbrush for right.
[01:07:21.100 --> 01:07:22.100]   Yes.
[01:07:22.100 --> 01:07:23.820]   I'm sitting on the wheel.
[01:07:23.820 --> 01:07:24.300]   I travel.
[01:07:24.300 --> 01:07:25.060]   I'm like, shh.
[01:07:25.060 --> 01:07:26.220]   You had me at batteries because--
[01:07:26.220 --> 01:07:26.740]   Batteries.
[01:07:26.740 --> 01:07:27.240]   Right?
[01:07:27.240 --> 01:07:29.300]   Literally half the time I travel, I forget the charge.
[01:07:29.300 --> 01:07:29.800]   Yeah.
[01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:30.300]   Yeah.
[01:07:30.300 --> 01:07:32.540]   And then I'm using the electric toothbrush like a manual toothbrush.
[01:07:32.540 --> 01:07:33.060]   Can I get a question?
[01:07:33.060 --> 01:07:33.940]   Terrible, by the way.
[01:07:33.940 --> 01:07:34.780]   Doesn't vibrate.
[01:07:34.780 --> 01:07:38.940]   I have a separate quip that goes in my dopp kit for travel.
[01:07:38.940 --> 01:07:40.340]   So I always have it ready.
[01:07:40.340 --> 01:07:42.540]   Quip is one of the first electric toothbrushes accepted
[01:07:42.540 --> 01:07:44.900]   by the American Dental Association.
[01:07:44.900 --> 01:07:47.460]   They're backed by over 25,000 dental professionals,
[01:07:47.460 --> 01:07:49.740]   thousands of verified five-star reviews.
[01:07:49.740 --> 01:07:52.820]   Everybody who uses quip loves it.
[01:07:52.820 --> 01:07:55.460]   Over a million happy, healthy mouths.
[01:07:55.460 --> 01:07:58.940]   Go to getquip.com/twit right now.
[01:07:58.940 --> 01:07:59.980]   Quip is also affordable.
[01:07:59.980 --> 01:08:01.500]   It's most affordable electric toothbrush out there.
[01:08:01.500 --> 01:08:03.500]   It starts at $25.
[01:08:03.500 --> 01:08:05.860]   If you go to getquip.com/twit, you'll also
[01:08:05.860 --> 01:08:07.860]   get your first refill pack free when
[01:08:07.860 --> 01:08:10.140]   you purchase any quip electric toothbrush.

[01:08:18.540 --> 01:08:20.180]   free brush better.
[01:08:20.180 --> 01:08:23.100]   I love my quip with quip.
[01:08:23.100 --> 01:08:25.260]   And your smile is dazzling.
[01:08:25.260 --> 01:08:26.260]   It really is.
[01:08:26.260 --> 01:08:29.580]   We have quips for-- because we have a 16-year-old.
[01:08:29.580 --> 01:08:30.580]   He has sleepovers.
[01:08:30.580 --> 01:08:32.220]   And the kids-- it's interesting.
[01:08:32.220 --> 01:08:34.740]   16-year-olds never bring toothbrushes
[01:08:34.740 --> 01:08:36.260]   when they come to sleepover.
[01:08:36.260 --> 01:08:36.780]   Really?
[01:08:36.780 --> 01:08:37.380]   Never.
[01:08:37.380 --> 01:08:38.020]   Never.
[01:08:38.020 --> 01:08:39.460]   So we say, no problem.
[01:08:39.460 --> 01:08:40.540]   We've got your quip right here.
[01:08:40.540 --> 01:08:42.660]   We'll put their name on it.
[01:08:42.660 --> 01:08:44.020]   It's kind of funny.
[01:08:44.020 --> 01:08:47.340]   They don't not like that, I admit, but too bad.
[01:08:47.340 --> 01:08:48.180]   Too bad.
[01:08:48.180 --> 01:08:50.220]   We have to brush our teeth when we go to the little porch.
[01:08:50.220 --> 01:08:51.780]   We don't like it.
[01:08:51.780 --> 01:08:52.580]   We don't like it.
[01:08:52.580 --> 01:08:53.420]   It's a tough life.
[01:08:53.420 --> 01:08:54.020]   It's a tough life.
[01:08:54.020 --> 01:08:54.540]   It's a tough.
[01:08:54.540 --> 01:08:54.540]   Yeah.
[01:08:54.540 --> 01:08:55.580]   It's a lot of cavities and less time, right?
[01:08:55.580 --> 01:08:56.580]   I see friends, money, and then I talk.
[01:08:56.580 --> 01:09:02.060]   Lisa is-- I don't want to say it tooth-nancy.
[01:09:02.060 --> 01:09:03.460]   But Lisa is--
[01:09:03.460 --> 01:09:04.820]   She's a dental health--
[01:09:04.820 --> 01:09:05.660]   you already said it, Leo.
[01:09:05.660 --> 01:09:06.660]   Adduce.
[01:09:06.660 --> 01:09:07.420]   Enthusiast.
[01:09:07.420 --> 01:09:07.780]   Yes.
[01:09:07.780 --> 01:09:09.420]   She's very serious about it.
[01:09:09.420 --> 01:09:09.980]   What's important?
[01:09:09.980 --> 01:09:12.420]   As a result, Michael has never had a cavity.
[01:09:12.420 --> 01:09:12.820]   Never had a cavity.
[01:09:12.820 --> 01:09:13.460]   Are you serious?
[01:09:13.460 --> 01:09:13.780]   Yeah.
[01:09:13.780 --> 01:09:14.300]   Wow.
[01:09:14.300 --> 01:09:14.620]   Yeah.
[01:09:14.620 --> 01:09:15.020]   That's OK.
[01:09:15.020 --> 01:09:15.700]   You can't knock it off.
[01:09:15.700 --> 01:09:16.460]   No, it works.
[01:09:16.460 --> 01:09:17.940]   Got the last time I went to the dentist.
[01:09:17.940 --> 01:09:19.620]   The dentist-- I was went to a new dentist,
[01:09:19.620 --> 01:09:20.940]   and she looked at me, and I--
[01:09:20.940 --> 01:09:22.940]   yeah, you've got put his teeth.
[01:09:22.940 --> 01:09:23.440]   Ah!
[01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:24.300]   This is so--
[01:09:24.300 --> 01:09:25.180]   Isn't that, though?
[01:09:25.180 --> 01:09:25.940]   That's no longer.
[01:09:25.940 --> 01:09:27.140]   That's a conard.
[01:09:27.140 --> 01:09:28.780]   As she kids these days, they get--
[01:09:28.780 --> 01:09:28.980]   They get--
[01:09:28.980 --> 01:09:29.580]   They get--
[01:09:29.580 --> 01:09:31.580]   Yeah, I mean, they get decent dent,
[01:09:31.580 --> 01:09:33.820]   and they are wearing braces, which means that a lot more
[01:09:33.820 --> 01:09:34.700]   British people got even--
[01:09:34.700 --> 01:09:36.660]   That is a blight in the United States, though.
[01:09:36.660 --> 01:09:38.940]   There is no teenager now in the US.
[01:09:38.940 --> 01:09:41.860]   I never had braces, but it's just like automatic.
[01:09:41.860 --> 01:09:42.060]   Yeah.
[01:09:42.060 --> 01:09:42.580]   Get braces.
[01:09:42.580 --> 01:09:43.540]   I don't know why that is.
[01:09:43.540 --> 01:09:45.500]   And there's a huge class distinction back to that,
[01:09:45.500 --> 01:09:47.260]   in teeth in America, having tests
[01:09:47.260 --> 01:09:49.100]   that are imperfect is considered to be a--
[01:09:49.100 --> 01:09:50.460]   That's a good point.
[01:09:50.460 --> 01:09:51.220]   That's-- that's a terrible--
[01:09:51.220 --> 01:09:53.940]   That's the parents who have spent the car payment on your face.
[01:09:53.940 --> 01:09:54.100]   Yeah.
[01:09:54.100 --> 01:09:54.780]   It's basically it.
[01:09:54.780 --> 01:09:56.540]   Which is really weird, because at the same time,
[01:09:56.540 --> 01:09:58.580]   there seems to be no social stigma about grossly
[01:09:58.580 --> 01:10:00.420]   overweight people wearing spandex in public.
[01:10:00.420 --> 01:10:01.860]   No, we like that.
[01:10:01.860 --> 01:10:02.380]   Yeah.
[01:10:02.380 --> 01:10:04.460]   What's wrong with dangerous ground, gentlemen?
[01:10:04.460 --> 01:10:05.620]   Yeah, no kidding.
[01:10:05.620 --> 01:10:05.980]   Careful.
[01:10:05.980 --> 01:10:06.460]   Careful.
[01:10:06.460 --> 01:10:06.980]   Yeah.
[01:10:06.980 --> 01:10:07.420]   Careful.
[01:10:07.420 --> 01:10:10.380]   In the world of technology, I hear this song coming out
[01:10:10.380 --> 01:10:13.060]   for something.
[01:10:13.060 --> 01:10:16.300]   Amazon Echo Shopping Tripled.
[01:10:16.300 --> 01:10:16.820]   Yeah.
[01:10:16.820 --> 01:10:17.900]   Yeah.
[01:10:17.900 --> 01:10:18.300]   Tripled.
[01:10:18.300 --> 01:10:19.940]   From a low number, though, right?
[01:10:19.940 --> 01:10:20.860]   Yeah, I mean--
[01:10:20.860 --> 01:10:23.340]   Three times nothing is not much.
[01:10:23.340 --> 01:10:26.700]   The number of voice-activated orders placed on Amazon's Echo
[01:10:26.700 --> 01:10:29.580]   three times greater during the 2018 holiday season
[01:10:29.580 --> 01:10:31.300]   than last year.
[01:10:31.300 --> 01:10:34.020]   Echo was also called on hundreds of-- this is, you know,
[01:10:34.020 --> 01:10:36.180]   soft stats from Amazon--
[01:10:36.180 --> 01:10:39.420]   hundreds of thousands of times to help folks find cocktail
[01:10:39.420 --> 01:10:40.820]   recipes.
[01:10:40.820 --> 01:10:43.580]   The number one, Eggnog and Moscow mules.
[01:10:43.580 --> 01:10:44.420]   Oh, good, good.
[01:10:44.420 --> 01:10:46.300]   You know, first of all, Eggnog's bad,
[01:10:46.300 --> 01:10:47.300]   but a Moscow mules delicious.
[01:10:47.300 --> 01:10:48.300]   I feel like it's not good.
[01:10:48.300 --> 01:10:49.060]   I feel like it's not good.
[01:10:49.060 --> 01:10:51.340]   I could not know how to make a Moscow mule.
[01:10:51.340 --> 01:10:55.180]   I was just going to just slam Amazon again,
[01:10:55.180 --> 01:10:56.860]   because they always do this, as journalists,
[01:10:56.860 --> 01:10:57.820]   it's so frustrating.
[01:10:57.820 --> 01:10:59.540]   They're like, oh, it tripled.
[01:10:59.540 --> 01:10:59.700]   Yeah.
[01:10:59.700 --> 01:11:02.740]   OK, from one to one, from one to three.
[01:11:02.740 --> 01:11:03.940]   Yeah.
[01:11:03.940 --> 01:11:08.620]   They always try-- they always imply wild growth
[01:11:08.620 --> 01:11:10.740]   without ever telling you what it is.
[01:11:10.740 --> 01:11:12.140]   And they will never tell.
[01:11:12.140 --> 01:11:13.700]   Here's the number.
[01:11:13.700 --> 01:11:14.420]   A real number.
[01:11:14.420 --> 01:11:17.340]   In the US alone, Amazon shipped more than one billion
[01:11:17.340 --> 01:11:20.180]   products through Amazon Prime.
[01:11:20.180 --> 01:11:22.380]   So yeah, they're a shipping company then.
[01:11:22.380 --> 01:11:23.500]   Yes, I mean--
[01:11:23.500 --> 01:11:24.940]   Well, we have one other number.
[01:11:24.940 --> 01:11:27.860]   Two days ago, Amazon announced they sold over 100 million
[01:11:27.860 --> 01:11:29.060]   electric devices.
[01:11:29.060 --> 01:11:30.060]   Yes.
[01:11:30.060 --> 01:11:32.700]   Well, that's not just their own echoes.
[01:11:32.700 --> 01:11:35.340]   That's devices with Echo or Amazon voice services built in.
[01:11:35.340 --> 01:11:37.340]   Yes, my future father-in-law is a bunch of these,
[01:11:37.340 --> 01:11:38.940]   and they're moderately OK.
[01:11:38.940 --> 01:11:40.740]   But to your point, though, you're totally correct.
[01:11:40.740 --> 01:11:42.140]   They almost never release a base.
[01:11:42.140 --> 01:11:44.140]   They only need the Kindle forever.
[01:11:44.140 --> 01:11:46.660]   Biggest Kindle you're ever up 200%, was it?
[01:11:46.660 --> 01:11:47.740]   Four from two?
[01:11:47.740 --> 01:11:48.740]   Right, yeah.
[01:11:48.740 --> 01:11:50.580]   And it drives me absolutely bad.
[01:11:50.580 --> 01:11:52.300]   Does anybody buy Kindle's anymore?
[01:11:52.300 --> 01:11:53.500]   Not the tablets.
[01:11:53.500 --> 01:11:54.340]   The e-commerce.
[01:11:54.340 --> 01:11:55.660]   No, no, that's just what they do.
[01:11:55.660 --> 01:11:56.020]   Really?
[01:11:56.020 --> 01:11:58.380]   Yeah, because they're all one-died.
[01:11:58.380 --> 01:12:00.060]   It's just if you're going away on holiday
[01:12:00.060 --> 01:12:03.460]   or if you're commuting, then they are really quite handy.
[01:12:03.460 --> 01:12:05.500]   Because I'm never anywhere without a book.
[01:12:05.500 --> 01:12:07.300]   I don't have a Kindle I just put on my phone.
[01:12:07.300 --> 01:12:08.500]   Well, that's why I wonder.
[01:12:08.500 --> 01:12:08.900]   Because--
[01:12:08.900 --> 01:12:10.620]   But she won't have a tablet or a phone.
[01:12:10.620 --> 01:12:11.340]   You've got Kindle.
[01:12:11.340 --> 01:12:13.380]   But with a smartphone, you've got to recharge it
[01:12:13.380 --> 01:12:14.660]   every day.
[01:12:14.660 --> 01:12:17.900]   Whereas if you've got a Kindle, which is using e-ing,
[01:12:17.900 --> 01:12:19.500]   then nothing can allow us for two weeks.
[01:12:19.500 --> 01:12:21.380]   Remember, I'm not living in the 21st century,
[01:12:21.380 --> 01:12:22.500]   so you'll have to tell me.
[01:12:22.500 --> 01:12:24.700]   In Victoria, England, there are no plugs.
[01:12:24.700 --> 01:12:28.100]   People not--
[01:12:28.100 --> 01:12:30.620]   Are e-books replacing paper books?
[01:12:30.620 --> 01:12:32.100]   Or are people just not reading books?
[01:12:32.100 --> 01:12:32.700]   No, you do.
[01:12:32.700 --> 01:12:35.180]   Tablets are replacing e-books to slowly.
[01:12:35.180 --> 01:12:37.300]   And I think paper books are on the rise.
[01:12:37.300 --> 01:12:41.460]   So paper books are also replacing Kindles and stuff like that.
[01:12:41.460 --> 01:12:42.220]   Yeah.
[01:12:42.220 --> 01:12:47.020]   So we thought, all of us in the late 20th century,
[01:12:47.020 --> 01:12:48.860]   that people would stop buying books by now.
[01:12:48.860 --> 01:12:50.980]   The paper would be dead.
[01:12:50.980 --> 01:12:52.980]   I mean, it's true we don't see magazines and newspapers,
[01:12:52.980 --> 01:12:56.380]   but I think e-books are not as satisfying an experience.
[01:12:56.380 --> 01:12:56.860]   They are not.
[01:12:56.860 --> 01:13:00.420]   I have three print books in my backpack, I think, right now.
[01:13:00.420 --> 01:13:02.180]   To me, I've never spent more money on print books
[01:13:02.180 --> 01:13:04.380]   than I do this last 12 months.
[01:13:04.380 --> 01:13:06.100]   And I love-- I live on digital devices.
[01:13:06.100 --> 01:13:07.340]   But you know what they give me?
[01:13:07.340 --> 01:13:08.860]   It's a break from that.
[01:13:08.860 --> 01:13:09.380]   Exactly.
[01:13:09.380 --> 01:13:12.260]   And critically, I can't read on a tablet or a phone,
[01:13:12.260 --> 01:13:15.060]   because I will get at least some notification that'll derail me.
[01:13:15.060 --> 01:13:17.180]   A print book is a gift to yourself.
[01:13:17.180 --> 01:13:17.700]   It is.
[01:13:17.700 --> 01:13:20.660]   It's the second biggest gift to yourself you can have.
[01:13:20.660 --> 01:13:22.460]   Number one is print newspapers.
[01:13:22.460 --> 01:13:23.020]   Squatty potty.
[01:13:23.020 --> 01:13:23.500]   Right.
[01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:25.260]   Oh, and print newspapers at times?
[01:13:25.260 --> 01:13:25.980]   Oh my god.
[01:13:25.980 --> 01:13:26.700]   Have you done that?
[01:13:26.700 --> 01:13:28.700]   It's like this is the most amazing thing in the world.
[01:13:28.700 --> 01:13:29.700]   I always do read the song.
[01:13:29.700 --> 01:13:30.300]   We read Squatty potty.
[01:13:30.300 --> 01:13:31.980]   You're printing newspapers at the same time.
[01:13:31.980 --> 01:13:32.980]   Yeah.
[01:13:32.980 --> 01:13:33.820]   And a cigarette.
[01:13:33.820 --> 01:13:35.900]   It's peanut butter and jelly.
[01:13:35.900 --> 01:13:39.180]   Well, yeah, I mean, I posted a picture of myself
[01:13:39.180 --> 01:13:41.940]   online with the bookshelves behind me.
[01:13:41.940 --> 01:13:43.420]   And the amount of people are just like,
[01:13:43.420 --> 01:13:44.980]   you've never read all those books.
[01:13:44.980 --> 01:13:46.180]   Is that a screen?
[01:13:46.180 --> 01:13:48.060]   Yeah, I mean, it was just like--
[01:13:48.060 --> 01:13:48.860]   Oh, look at that.
[01:13:48.860 --> 01:13:49.620]   --many.
[01:13:49.620 --> 01:13:50.380]   But it's still--
[01:13:50.380 --> 01:13:50.780]   It isn't that many.
[01:13:50.780 --> 01:13:51.580]   It's just like--
[01:13:51.580 --> 01:13:52.380]   Press wanker.
[01:13:52.380 --> 01:13:54.460]   You can't see his--
[01:13:54.460 --> 01:13:56.460]   If you're watching the show, there's a picture of--
[01:13:56.460 --> 01:13:58.180]   Is that on your Instagram?
[01:13:58.180 --> 01:13:59.820]   It's on Facebook.
[01:13:59.820 --> 01:14:00.700]   Oh, that's too big.
[01:14:00.700 --> 01:14:02.380]   I don't do any--
[01:14:02.380 --> 01:14:04.540]   It doesn't do paywalls or wall gardens.
[01:14:04.540 --> 01:14:05.060]   Yeah.
[01:14:05.060 --> 01:14:08.460]   Anyway, it's a picture of Ian wearing a very tight red top.
[01:14:08.460 --> 01:14:10.260]   No other word is a vice.
[01:14:10.260 --> 01:14:12.420]   In front of a collection of you playing Australian rules
[01:14:12.420 --> 01:14:13.020]   football now?
[01:14:13.020 --> 01:14:16.860]   No, no, I was going to Schmukon, the hacking conference.
[01:14:16.860 --> 01:14:19.100]   And I'd made a bet with one of the organizers,
[01:14:19.100 --> 01:14:21.020]   because they said, obviously, you're press,
[01:14:21.020 --> 01:14:23.180]   and you've got to make that known to people.
[01:14:23.180 --> 01:14:25.460]   So always where you're bad, just said, I'll go one better.
[01:14:25.460 --> 01:14:27.500]   So I just wore a t-shirt saying press wanker,
[01:14:27.500 --> 01:14:29.220]   and that way everyone knew--
[01:14:29.220 --> 01:14:30.820]   It's also your nickname all in one go.
[01:14:30.820 --> 01:14:31.500]   It's perfect.
[01:14:31.500 --> 01:14:34.300]   Well, somebody did ask if it was a service, but no, it was--
[01:14:34.300 --> 01:14:34.780]   Wanking it.
[01:14:34.780 --> 01:14:35.780]   Go to the internet.
[01:14:35.780 --> 01:14:36.300]   Done.
[01:14:36.300 --> 01:14:37.300]   Family show.
[01:14:37.300 --> 01:14:38.300]   But yeah.
[01:14:38.300 --> 01:14:42.740]   Amazon said the number one toy in the holidays
[01:14:42.740 --> 01:14:45.500]   was the LOL Surprise--
[01:14:45.500 --> 01:14:46.700]   I don't know, is that part of the name,
[01:14:46.700 --> 01:14:49.540]   or is that editorializing from "The Fortune?"
[01:14:49.540 --> 01:14:53.340]   The LOL Surprise glam glitter series doll
[01:14:53.340 --> 01:14:54.580]   with seven surprises.
[01:14:54.580 --> 01:14:56.060]   No, I guess that's part of the name.
[01:14:56.060 --> 01:14:57.460]   "Fortune" does not sense the humor,
[01:14:57.460 --> 01:14:58.740]   so it must be the actual name.
[01:14:58.740 --> 01:15:03.380]   The second most popular toy, the Nerf Enstrike Elite Strongarm
[01:15:03.380 --> 01:15:04.060]   Blaster.
[01:15:04.060 --> 01:15:05.020]   That makes sense.
[01:15:05.020 --> 01:15:05.300]   Yeah.
[01:15:05.300 --> 01:15:05.860]   Good fun.
[01:15:05.860 --> 01:15:08.700]   It sounds like one was for girls and one was for boys,
[01:15:08.700 --> 01:15:09.660]   but I don't want to say it.
[01:15:09.660 --> 01:15:11.980]   So was the Keltweisserborn that unicorn thing
[01:15:11.980 --> 01:15:12.900]   that's been--
[01:15:12.900 --> 01:15:13.980]   Have you seen this?
[01:15:13.980 --> 01:15:15.900]   It's-- I saw it on--
[01:15:15.900 --> 01:15:16.340]   It might be.
[01:15:16.340 --> 01:15:17.980]   I don't think glitter is a good idea,
[01:15:17.980 --> 01:15:19.140]   but let's just take a look.
[01:15:19.140 --> 01:15:21.900]   Yeah, it's a unicorn that you feed with this--
[01:15:21.900 --> 01:15:22.500]   What?
[01:15:22.500 --> 01:15:23.180]   This is a--
[01:15:23.180 --> 01:15:24.300]   This is a ball.
[01:15:24.300 --> 01:15:24.820]   Oh, OK.
[01:15:24.820 --> 01:15:26.300]   Now, the number one in the UK--
[01:15:26.300 --> 01:15:26.940]   Inside the ball, wait a minute.
[01:15:26.940 --> 01:15:27.860]   Open the ball.
[01:15:27.860 --> 01:15:29.380]   Inside the ball.
[01:15:29.380 --> 01:15:31.380]   Seven surprises.
[01:15:31.380 --> 01:15:33.100]   Little dollies.
[01:15:33.100 --> 01:15:34.580]   They're all glittery.
[01:15:34.580 --> 01:15:36.140]   How much money does this egg cost?
[01:15:36.140 --> 01:15:36.820]   $8.
[01:15:36.820 --> 01:15:37.740]   What?
[01:15:37.740 --> 01:15:38.260]   An egg?
[01:15:38.260 --> 01:15:39.580]   An egg to you for free.
[01:15:39.580 --> 01:15:41.340]   Oh, prime.
[01:15:41.340 --> 01:15:43.100]   No wonder this is the top prize.
[01:15:43.100 --> 01:15:44.540]   That's a stocking stuffer's drink.
[01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:45.340]   I drink.
[01:15:45.340 --> 01:15:46.820]   To Happy Meal without the french fries.
[01:15:46.820 --> 01:15:48.420]   Yeah, but oh, that's a downgrade.
[01:15:48.420 --> 01:15:49.620]   Well, also, but you don't allow
[01:15:49.620 --> 01:15:52.420]   kinder surprise eggs here over with the little toy inside.
[01:15:52.420 --> 01:15:53.460]   Why don't we allow that?
[01:15:53.460 --> 01:15:54.380]   Because it's a chocobol.
[01:15:54.380 --> 01:15:55.740]   Apparently, it's a choking problem.
[01:15:55.740 --> 01:15:57.140]   You know, it's like--
[01:15:57.140 --> 01:15:57.940]   But I have a lot of--
[01:15:57.940 --> 01:15:59.100]   Bring me that bag for that.
[01:15:59.100 --> 01:15:59.620]   --that's thick.
[01:15:59.620 --> 01:16:01.620]   No, I've never heard of anyone.
[01:16:01.620 --> 01:16:02.260]   It even--
[01:16:02.260 --> 01:16:04.100]   Maybe American children are not as--
[01:16:04.100 --> 01:16:04.700]   They buy it down.
[01:16:04.700 --> 01:16:05.540]   That's how they get the teeth.
[01:16:05.540 --> 01:16:07.180]   They have better teeth.
[01:16:07.180 --> 01:16:08.780]   Can we talk about the fact that Amazon's
[01:16:08.780 --> 01:16:10.500]   doing the whole Whole Foods push?
[01:16:10.500 --> 01:16:11.940]   Because I'm really excited about that.
[01:16:11.940 --> 01:16:15.500]   So Amazon bought Whole Foods, and they are now using them
[01:16:15.500 --> 01:16:18.540]   not only to deliver packages.
[01:16:18.540 --> 01:16:19.740]   I went into my Whole Foods yesterday.
[01:16:19.740 --> 01:16:22.340]   There's a massive wall of lockers.
[01:16:22.340 --> 01:16:23.500]   So you can what?
[01:16:23.500 --> 01:16:25.660]   Go there and get your package?
[01:16:25.660 --> 01:16:26.220]   Or--
[01:16:26.220 --> 01:16:27.340]   Why is this necessary?
[01:16:27.340 --> 01:16:28.820]   Don't people have--
[01:16:28.820 --> 01:16:29.380]   Have Paris.
[01:16:29.380 --> 01:16:29.980]   --or stops?
[01:16:29.980 --> 01:16:30.340]   No.
[01:16:30.340 --> 01:16:32.140]   No, other than apartments, Leo.
[01:16:32.140 --> 01:16:33.660]   Also, you've got porch Paris.
[01:16:33.660 --> 01:16:36.420]   So that's been a massive problem this Christmas.
[01:16:36.420 --> 01:16:38.220]   They reckon sort of over--
[01:16:38.220 --> 01:16:40.500]   Some like, ridiculous number, like 5 million people
[01:16:40.500 --> 01:16:42.340]   have had packages stolen off their front porch.
[01:16:42.340 --> 01:16:43.620]   You call them porch pirates?
[01:16:43.620 --> 01:16:44.380]   That's what they're called.
[01:16:44.380 --> 01:16:45.460]   That's far too lovely.
[01:16:45.460 --> 01:16:46.900]   I'm going to be porch pirate.
[01:16:46.900 --> 01:16:47.860]   I'm a parchment pirate.
[01:16:47.860 --> 01:16:48.340]   Right.
[01:16:48.340 --> 01:16:48.860]   How about--
[01:16:48.860 --> 01:16:49.900]   OK, stealing scumbags.
[01:16:49.900 --> 01:16:50.700]   There you go.
[01:16:50.700 --> 01:16:52.060]   The iteration makes it good.
[01:16:52.060 --> 01:16:53.540]   But stealing scumbags, or--
[01:16:53.540 --> 01:16:56.500]   You know, they actually want to build more Whole Foods stores
[01:16:56.500 --> 01:16:58.700]   because they want every one of you
[01:16:58.700 --> 01:17:02.540]   to be within a short driving distance of a Whole Foods.
[01:17:02.540 --> 01:17:03.060]   Yeah.
[01:17:03.060 --> 01:17:03.700]   To give them all the--
[01:17:03.700 --> 01:17:05.420]   I live half a block from a Whole Foods
[01:17:05.420 --> 01:17:07.380]   and can tell you that what happens is you never
[01:17:07.380 --> 01:17:08.740]   have stuff in your fridge.
[01:17:08.740 --> 01:17:10.180]   And so you've got to Whole Foods for stuff,
[01:17:10.180 --> 01:17:11.220]   and then you don't have any money.
[01:17:11.220 --> 01:17:12.420]   You don't have any money in your pocket.
[01:17:12.420 --> 01:17:13.420]   But it works, though.
[01:17:13.420 --> 01:17:14.060]   You're fed.
[01:17:14.060 --> 01:17:15.060]   But then you're also broke.
[01:17:15.060 --> 01:17:15.560]   Yes.
[01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:16.560]   Oh, I need to find a middle car.
[01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:17.580]   I'll go down to Whole Foods.
[01:17:17.580 --> 01:17:20.300]   Oh, what's a $50 bill, right?
[01:17:20.300 --> 01:17:20.820]   You do--
[01:17:20.820 --> 01:17:21.460]   I did.
[01:17:21.460 --> 01:17:24.340]   They finally got me to download the Amazon Prime app
[01:17:24.340 --> 01:17:27.740]   so that the Whole Foods app so I could get a prime discount.
[01:17:27.740 --> 01:17:28.460]   And I have--
[01:17:28.460 --> 01:17:30.180]   I don't know why, but I feel like now it's just
[01:17:30.180 --> 01:17:31.300]   going to watch me everywhere I can.
[01:17:31.300 --> 01:17:32.300]   Oh, yeah, it is.
[01:17:32.300 --> 01:17:33.300]   That's the whole point.
[01:17:33.300 --> 01:17:34.540]   Because all it is is a barcode.
[01:17:34.540 --> 01:17:35.700]   They could send me a picture.
[01:17:35.700 --> 01:17:36.140]   But sure.
[01:17:36.140 --> 01:17:38.940]   I mean, they've had store cards in this country for 20, 50 years.
[01:17:38.940 --> 01:17:40.140]   Now surely it's the same thing.
[01:17:40.140 --> 01:17:41.700]   But I don't trust Amazon with my data.
[01:17:41.700 --> 01:17:43.660]   So I've actually stopped using the Prime app.
[01:17:43.660 --> 01:17:45.860]   I never got discounts, but I gave them my data for free.
[01:17:45.860 --> 01:17:47.180]   And I was like, this is a poor trade.
[01:17:47.180 --> 01:17:49.060]   If you send me a dollar each trip,
[01:17:49.060 --> 01:17:50.260]   I'll give you my shopping cart.
[01:17:50.260 --> 01:17:50.700]   Right.
[01:17:50.700 --> 01:17:52.180]   But otherwise, I'm not going to tell you.
[01:17:52.180 --> 01:17:53.620]   I don't want to give you that, Bezos.
[01:17:53.620 --> 01:17:55.220]   I used to give Radio Shack my phone number
[01:17:55.220 --> 01:17:56.060]   when I bought batteries.
[01:17:56.060 --> 01:17:56.740]   Battery club.
[01:17:56.740 --> 01:17:56.940]   Yeah.
[01:17:56.940 --> 01:17:57.940]   What?
[01:17:57.940 --> 01:17:59.100]   The battery club.
[01:17:59.100 --> 01:18:01.260]   Again, we have to break it to him.
[01:18:01.260 --> 01:18:02.260]   Why don't you just have to--
[01:18:02.260 --> 01:18:04.820]   You're too young to remember the battery club.
[01:18:04.820 --> 01:18:06.100]   Battery of the month club.
[01:18:06.100 --> 01:18:07.700]   When you used to buy stuff at Radio Shack,
[01:18:07.700 --> 01:18:09.340]   they would want your phone number and what else?
[01:18:09.340 --> 01:18:09.860]   Everything.
[01:18:09.860 --> 01:18:10.540]   You'd have to have a trip.
[01:18:10.540 --> 01:18:11.500]   Sip code, everything.
[01:18:11.500 --> 01:18:12.460]   And he just gave it to him.
[01:18:12.460 --> 01:18:13.180]   Oh, yeah.
[01:18:13.180 --> 01:18:13.900]   Because back then it wasn't--
[01:18:13.900 --> 01:18:14.380]   Why not?
[01:18:14.380 --> 01:18:14.700]   --is dangerous?
[01:18:14.700 --> 01:18:15.220]   Why wouldn't you?
[01:18:15.220 --> 01:18:16.500]   I mean, eventually you're like, you know what?
[01:18:16.500 --> 01:18:18.260]   I give it to you like 20 times, and I'm not going to do it.
[01:18:18.260 --> 01:18:18.820]   You just give up.
[01:18:18.820 --> 01:18:19.180]   Yeah.
[01:18:19.180 --> 01:18:19.580]   You give up.
[01:18:19.580 --> 01:18:20.020]   OK.
[01:18:20.020 --> 01:18:21.260]   But they did that.
[01:18:21.260 --> 01:18:22.580]   I did buy stuff at Radio Shack.
[01:18:22.580 --> 01:18:25.380]   I'm not like that young, but I just didn't do Battery of the Month club.
[01:18:25.380 --> 01:18:26.780]   I think they stopped it at some point.
[01:18:26.780 --> 01:18:27.780]   You know, must have.
[01:18:27.780 --> 01:18:29.420]   That's not the whole company, too.
[01:18:29.420 --> 01:18:29.940]   Yeah.
[01:18:29.940 --> 01:18:36.220]   And they stopped that as well.
[01:18:36.220 --> 01:18:36.740]   Yeah.
[01:18:36.740 --> 01:18:38.060]   So the licensing body can actually--
[01:18:38.060 --> 01:18:38.580]   That's fine.
[01:18:38.580 --> 01:18:40.220]   And that works out very well.
[01:18:40.220 --> 01:18:41.980]   But I have the same problem at CVS.
[01:18:41.980 --> 01:18:43.660]   If there isn't a discount when I buy them stuff,
[01:18:43.660 --> 01:18:44.660]   I don't give them my phone number,
[01:18:44.660 --> 01:18:46.820]   because I'm not particularly interested in letting them know
[01:18:46.820 --> 01:18:49.660]   that I bought shaving cream yesterday or razor blades the day before.
[01:18:49.660 --> 01:18:52.020]   You know, it's cost benefit.
[01:18:52.020 --> 01:18:53.220]   Some of the stores they're building
[01:18:53.220 --> 01:18:56.060]   are actually bigger than the current health food stores,
[01:18:56.060 --> 01:18:58.580]   45,000 square feet.
[01:18:58.580 --> 01:19:00.580]   And that's for Amazon delivery and pickup.
[01:19:00.580 --> 01:19:02.700]   Well, Amazon sees the writing on the wall,
[01:19:02.700 --> 01:19:07.100]   which is that all stores, for the most part, in--
[01:19:07.100 --> 01:19:08.020]   Are going away.
[01:19:08.020 --> 01:19:10.220]   No, they're becoming experiences.
[01:19:10.220 --> 01:19:12.580]   So they're going to transform over the next 10 years.
[01:19:12.580 --> 01:19:15.500]   They're going to transform whole foods into a whole experience.
[01:19:15.500 --> 01:19:17.740]   And I don't know what that means, exactly.
[01:19:17.740 --> 01:19:20.940]   But it's going to be a lot more than just going buy some food.
[01:19:20.940 --> 01:19:23.380]   Was this the vision when they bought whole foods?
[01:19:23.380 --> 01:19:25.060]   That plus the thing that they're doing,
[01:19:25.060 --> 01:19:27.420]   we're just using it as a physical location for all kinds of--
[01:19:27.420 --> 01:19:29.220]   Which is what we talked about.
[01:19:29.220 --> 01:19:30.220]   Which is what we talked about.
[01:19:30.220 --> 01:19:31.700]   I think it was on Twitch when that happened.
[01:19:31.700 --> 01:19:34.660]   And we said they bought prime real estate near everyone's house.
[01:19:34.660 --> 01:19:36.060]   That's already a prime customer.
[01:19:36.060 --> 01:19:37.340]   And that's critical to them.
[01:19:37.340 --> 01:19:37.940]   Yeah.
[01:19:37.940 --> 01:19:41.060]   And the other part of it is that whole foods was popular.
[01:19:41.060 --> 01:19:42.580]   And I don't know, was it profitable?
[01:19:42.580 --> 01:19:44.660]   No, whole foods was actually struggling financially.
[01:19:44.660 --> 01:19:47.500]   OK, so really, Amazon could clearly see why.
[01:19:47.500 --> 01:19:48.660]   Is that not true?
[01:19:48.660 --> 01:19:50.060]   They weren't growing as fast as they should,
[01:19:50.060 --> 01:19:51.620]   but they were among the more profitable--
[01:19:51.620 --> 01:19:52.860]   Oh, they were profitable.
[01:19:52.860 --> 01:19:54.060]   I thought they were in trouble.
[01:19:54.060 --> 01:19:55.220]   They were not growing.
[01:19:55.220 --> 01:19:56.460]   It was like the problem.
[01:19:56.460 --> 01:19:59.260]   But the Amazon, as ruthless capitalists,
[01:19:59.260 --> 01:20:01.700]   they were able to easily see why.
[01:20:01.700 --> 01:20:04.940]   And so now you see whole foods is not quite as great
[01:20:04.940 --> 01:20:07.300]   if you're a superfoody or a health food person.
[01:20:07.300 --> 01:20:09.060]   They eliminate a lot of organic stuff.
[01:20:09.060 --> 01:20:11.380]   They've sort of gone in the direction of--
[01:20:11.380 --> 01:20:13.500]   They don't want to be organic food short.
[01:20:13.500 --> 01:20:16.860]   Amazon could realize we can make this so profitable
[01:20:16.860 --> 01:20:20.060]   if we just make it less idealistic and more
[01:20:20.060 --> 01:20:21.980]   just ruthlessly business-like.
[01:20:21.980 --> 01:20:23.140]   And that's what they're doing.
[01:20:23.140 --> 01:20:23.460]   So--
[01:20:23.460 --> 01:20:25.940]   It's not to say that the old whole foods didn't have its--
[01:20:25.940 --> 01:20:29.100]   I mean, the espritance of the oscos just--
[01:20:29.100 --> 01:20:29.780]   You heard how this?
[01:20:29.780 --> 01:20:30.620]   I don't want to know.
[01:20:30.620 --> 01:20:34.700]   I did spend $15 when I was $23 on four tomatoes by accident.
[01:20:34.700 --> 01:20:36.980]   Whole Foods Chief Executive John Mackie
[01:20:36.980 --> 01:20:38.500]   said in a recent video to employees
[01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:40.300]   he wants to address workers' concerns,
[01:20:40.300 --> 01:20:43.580]   improve communication, focus on career development in 2019.
[01:20:43.580 --> 01:20:47.300]   He says sales have grown since Amazon took over.
[01:20:47.300 --> 01:20:49.460]   At the beginning of this second year of this merger,
[01:20:49.460 --> 01:20:52.700]   Mackie said we're going to pivot back to team member growth
[01:20:52.700 --> 01:20:53.700]   and happiness.
[01:20:53.700 --> 01:20:56.900]   The minute you hit the word pivot, something bad is going to happen.
[01:20:56.900 --> 01:20:59.140]   Well, Amazon-- and I imagine Whole Foods
[01:20:59.140 --> 01:21:02.620]   too is getting a lot of heat for poor treatment of workers.
[01:21:02.620 --> 01:21:05.860]   Yeah, and honestly, I've never seen a whole foods worker who
[01:21:05.860 --> 01:21:07.140]   really looked happy in that job.
[01:21:07.140 --> 01:21:08.340]   Well, they do seem glum.
[01:21:08.340 --> 01:21:10.540]   Yeah.
[01:21:10.540 --> 01:21:13.140]   I mean, obviously, if you're standing at a till running
[01:21:13.140 --> 01:21:14.140]   through other people's--
[01:21:14.140 --> 01:21:15.420]   If you're taking all my money, you should be happier.
[01:21:15.420 --> 01:21:16.340]   Well, you know--
[01:21:16.340 --> 01:21:17.100]   Is she going to cut?
[01:21:17.100 --> 01:21:18.060]   And then they'll--
[01:21:18.060 --> 01:21:19.620]   The thing is they're not getting the money.
[01:21:19.620 --> 01:21:20.620]   That's true.
[01:21:20.620 --> 01:21:23.980]   And that suggests another benefit that Amazon, I'm sure,
[01:21:23.980 --> 01:21:24.860]   loved about Whole Foods.
[01:21:24.860 --> 01:21:25.900]   No unions.
[01:21:25.900 --> 01:21:26.500]   Yeah.
[01:21:26.500 --> 01:21:28.060]   An unionized grocery--
[01:21:28.060 --> 01:21:28.740]   I didn't know that.
[01:21:28.740 --> 01:21:29.180]   Yeah.
[01:21:29.180 --> 01:21:30.780]   And they actively fought against unions.
[01:21:30.780 --> 01:21:33.660]   Mackie is very rapidly anti-union.
[01:21:33.660 --> 01:21:34.140]   Yeah.
[01:21:34.140 --> 01:21:35.380]   Well, that means I don't like him much.
[01:21:35.380 --> 01:21:37.100]   I would go somewhere else, but they're too close to my house.
[01:21:37.100 --> 01:21:40.540]   But he put his money where his mouth is and paid his workers
[01:21:40.540 --> 01:21:43.380]   and gave benefits that were far superior to any other grocery
[01:21:43.380 --> 01:21:43.940]   union.
[01:21:43.940 --> 01:21:47.740]   So he basically was like, if you buy off the union
[01:21:47.740 --> 01:21:50.260]   with piles of money to the workers, I'm cool with that.
[01:21:50.260 --> 01:21:51.260]   You buy off the workers.
[01:21:51.260 --> 01:21:51.620]   Yeah.
[01:21:51.620 --> 01:21:52.100]   That's what I meant.
[01:21:52.100 --> 01:21:53.100]   Sorry.
[01:21:53.100 --> 01:21:53.540]   Yeah.
[01:21:53.540 --> 01:22:00.780]   So according to a study, Amazon Whole Foods employees
[01:22:00.780 --> 01:22:03.900]   will not be able to--
[01:22:03.900 --> 01:22:05.060]   no, I'm sorry.
[01:22:05.060 --> 01:22:07.980]   You would have to pay the average Facebook user $1,000
[01:22:07.980 --> 01:22:10.140]   a year to stop using it.
[01:22:10.140 --> 01:22:12.940]   I think that's one of those studies where they kind of like--
[01:22:12.940 --> 01:22:14.140]   The adoption.
[01:22:14.140 --> 01:22:15.140]   Got a read--
[01:22:15.140 --> 01:22:16.420]   It's a good adoption.
[01:22:16.420 --> 01:22:18.340]   I would like to see the methodology on that one,
[01:22:18.340 --> 01:22:20.300]   because I was highly suspicious about that.
[01:22:20.300 --> 01:22:23.060]   It was just like, it's really--
[01:22:23.060 --> 01:22:24.940]   it's like just throw a number out there.
[01:22:24.940 --> 01:22:26.580]   But if it actually came down to it,
[01:22:26.580 --> 01:22:28.900]   I think most people would cheerfully abandon Facebook
[01:22:28.900 --> 01:22:32.220]   for $100 gift cards.
[01:22:32.220 --> 01:22:33.500]   Like a real $100.
[01:22:33.500 --> 01:22:34.980]   Here's some actual $100.
[01:22:34.980 --> 01:22:37.180]   And then of course they'd sign back in under another name.
[01:22:37.180 --> 01:22:39.340]   But it's just--
[01:22:39.340 --> 01:22:44.500]   yeah, I mean, Facebook is useful in some circumstances.
[01:22:44.500 --> 01:22:46.660]   To ensure that respondents were telling the truth,
[01:22:46.660 --> 01:22:48.180]   the whole thing was real.
[01:22:48.180 --> 01:22:51.180]   Participants really did have to give up Facebook.
[01:22:51.180 --> 01:22:52.860]   And they really didn't get to that.
[01:22:52.860 --> 01:22:53.580]   Wow.
[01:22:53.580 --> 01:22:54.740]   How did they monitor that, though?
[01:22:54.740 --> 01:22:56.180]   How did they get involved in the next one?
[01:22:56.180 --> 01:23:02.060]   You'd have to pay an average $4.17 a day or $37 a week,
[01:23:02.060 --> 01:23:04.140]   and they'll stop using Facebook.
[01:23:04.140 --> 01:23:04.820]   That's not much money.
[01:23:04.820 --> 01:23:06.180]   $4 a day.
[01:23:06.180 --> 01:23:06.780]   $4 a day.
[01:23:06.780 --> 01:23:09.260]   I never got $4 for the-- for dollars in the joy
[01:23:09.260 --> 01:23:10.020]   out of that product.
[01:23:10.020 --> 01:23:12.420]   Students needed to be paid more than adults.
[01:23:12.420 --> 01:23:15.060]   It's one day a latte a day.
[01:23:15.060 --> 01:23:15.940]   I'll take it.
[01:23:15.940 --> 01:23:16.940]   I like lates, though.
[01:23:16.940 --> 01:23:17.380]   Oh, you see?
[01:23:17.380 --> 01:23:18.780]   You see, they paid me a latte.
[01:23:18.780 --> 01:23:19.980]   No, I'll take the latte.
[01:23:19.980 --> 01:23:21.300]   They paid me in coffee.
[01:23:21.300 --> 01:23:22.140]   That's different.
[01:23:22.140 --> 01:23:23.540]   Yeah, I'd do that.
[01:23:23.540 --> 01:23:24.820]   But I mean, so you're off.
[01:23:24.820 --> 01:23:25.580]   I'm off.
[01:23:25.580 --> 01:23:26.420]   You're going off.
[01:23:26.420 --> 01:23:26.860]   I'm getting off.
[01:23:26.860 --> 01:23:27.500]   And you're--
[01:23:27.500 --> 01:23:28.580]   I'm on.
[01:23:28.580 --> 01:23:30.740]   So one out of four of us grumpy people--
[01:23:30.740 --> 01:23:32.540]   And this is mainly because I need
[01:23:32.540 --> 01:23:34.180]   to keep staying contact with friends in the UK.
[01:23:34.180 --> 01:23:35.220]   You're a press wanker.
[01:23:35.220 --> 01:23:36.340]   And you have to ask.
[01:23:36.340 --> 01:23:37.340]   You have to have a--
[01:23:37.340 --> 01:23:39.820]   Actually, Facebook for News is useless.
[01:23:39.820 --> 01:23:40.860]   That's terrible.
[01:23:40.860 --> 01:23:42.540]   Twitter for News is actually pretty good.
[01:23:42.540 --> 01:23:43.620]   But Facebook for News is all--
[01:23:43.620 --> 01:23:44.700]   Well, you say useless.
[01:23:44.700 --> 01:23:46.620]   But it's the number one source of news.
[01:23:46.620 --> 01:23:47.660]   I mean, people actually--
[01:23:47.660 --> 01:23:49.220]   News can sometimes use it for News can sometimes.
[01:23:49.220 --> 01:23:50.220]   Yeah, News can sometimes.
[01:23:50.220 --> 01:23:52.060]   But if you're looking for breaking news and--
[01:23:52.060 --> 01:23:52.700]   Oh, yeah, it's awful.
[01:23:52.700 --> 01:23:54.620]   You know, it's just worthless.
[01:23:54.620 --> 01:23:55.100]   It is worthless.
[01:23:55.100 --> 01:23:56.780]   The only reason I use Facebook is because I've
[01:23:56.780 --> 01:23:58.700]   got a bunch of friends back in the UK.
[01:23:58.700 --> 01:24:01.700]   And I like to know what they're up to.
[01:24:01.700 --> 01:24:04.660]   With American friends, but generally just talk.
[01:24:04.660 --> 01:24:06.340]   I know it's old fashioned to pick up a phone
[01:24:06.340 --> 01:24:07.740]   and make a phone call these days.
[01:24:07.740 --> 01:24:11.380]   But either that or an email.
[01:24:11.380 --> 01:24:14.420]   That was the biggest reason, the biggest difficult thing
[01:24:14.420 --> 01:24:17.060]   about giving up Instagram, which is that I have friends all
[01:24:17.060 --> 01:24:18.060]   over the world.
[01:24:18.060 --> 01:24:20.060]   It's a train of going to lose track of you.
[01:24:20.060 --> 01:24:20.580]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:24:20.580 --> 01:24:21.340]   And people like you.
[01:24:21.340 --> 01:24:22.460]   Yep, exactly.
[01:24:22.460 --> 01:24:25.620]   But what's funny is I sort of keep track of you
[01:24:25.620 --> 01:24:27.660]   in your life through Lisa's accounts.
[01:24:27.660 --> 01:24:29.020]   Yeah, that's cheating, isn't it?
[01:24:29.020 --> 01:24:29.540]   And yeah.
[01:24:29.540 --> 01:24:31.580]   My wife posts all these pictures of me.
[01:24:31.580 --> 01:24:33.020]   Right, right.
[01:24:33.020 --> 01:24:35.100]   It's probably best that you didn't see some of them.
[01:24:35.100 --> 01:24:35.620]   I know.
[01:24:35.620 --> 01:24:36.260]   I've heard.
[01:24:36.260 --> 01:24:36.780]   I've heard.
[01:24:36.780 --> 01:24:38.540]   Yeah.
[01:24:38.540 --> 01:24:39.860]   But you really do give up.
[01:24:39.860 --> 01:24:41.580]   I mean, they really do kind of own us.
[01:24:41.580 --> 01:24:44.620]   And it's really painful to get off these networks.
[01:24:44.620 --> 01:24:48.140]   Promise I haven't replaced it with something that I should
[01:24:48.140 --> 01:24:51.220]   replace it with, like letters to you.
[01:24:51.220 --> 01:24:53.340]   Or emails or something like that.
[01:24:53.340 --> 01:24:54.580]   Telegram, staining touch.
[01:24:54.580 --> 01:24:56.580]   Communicate less, and that's OK.
[01:24:56.580 --> 01:24:57.620]   I sat down.
[01:24:57.620 --> 01:24:58.460]   I didn't know.
[01:24:58.460 --> 01:25:00.660]   I had to ask you, Leo, how have you been?
[01:25:00.660 --> 01:25:01.540]   Was it nice?
[01:25:01.540 --> 01:25:01.740]   Yeah.
[01:25:01.740 --> 01:25:03.180]   And you said nothing has changed.
[01:25:03.180 --> 01:25:04.940]   But I still had to take the phone to think about it.
[01:25:04.940 --> 01:25:06.140]   I think face is good.
[01:25:06.140 --> 01:25:06.580]   Yeah.
[01:25:06.580 --> 01:25:09.380]   But it's not practical in this modern world, or is it?
[01:25:09.380 --> 01:25:10.820]   We're still going to have friends around the world.
[01:25:10.820 --> 01:25:12.620]   Back in the day, you knew Bill down the street.
[01:25:12.620 --> 01:25:14.700]   You knew it's nice to have--
[01:25:14.700 --> 01:25:16.060]   I mean, I had a fortification.
[01:25:16.060 --> 01:25:17.900]   --forification when somebody has something to say
[01:25:17.900 --> 01:25:19.460]   or something to show.
[01:25:19.460 --> 01:25:21.780]   And this is why I like the nice book concept,
[01:25:21.780 --> 01:25:23.620]   the Google Photos, shared folders.
[01:25:23.620 --> 01:25:24.820]   You get the notifications.
[01:25:24.820 --> 01:25:25.660]   You see the pictures.
[01:25:25.660 --> 01:25:26.420]   You see the comments.
[01:25:26.420 --> 01:25:27.180]   You get to like them.
[01:25:27.180 --> 01:25:28.260]   You get to interact with people.
[01:25:28.260 --> 01:25:29.740]   As you said, Mike, it's a false image.
[01:25:29.740 --> 01:25:32.580]   Because no one puts the bad stuff on Facebook.
[01:25:32.580 --> 01:25:34.340]   And it's one of those psychotic people.
[01:25:34.340 --> 01:25:36.820]   But generally, it's just like, isn't life great?
[01:25:36.820 --> 01:25:37.380]   Isn't life wonderful?
[01:25:37.380 --> 01:25:39.900]   And there are a damnit studies shows that this does do press.
[01:25:39.900 --> 01:25:41.340]   It's a public performance.
[01:25:41.340 --> 01:25:42.580]   And this is the problem.
[01:25:42.580 --> 01:25:43.900]   This is what I like about--
[01:25:43.900 --> 01:25:46.100]   It's Google Photos is more homey.
[01:25:46.100 --> 01:25:47.340]   There's no performances.
[01:25:47.340 --> 01:25:49.020]   We need to go back to Chautauqua.
[01:25:49.020 --> 01:25:50.020]   Yeah, let's do that.
[01:25:50.020 --> 01:25:51.300]   I heard you talking about that.
[01:25:51.300 --> 01:25:52.380]   OK, now this is--
[01:25:52.380 --> 01:25:52.900]   Chautauqua?
[01:25:52.900 --> 01:25:54.900]   This is back to the village.
[01:25:54.900 --> 01:25:55.500]   The village.
[01:25:55.500 --> 01:26:00.380]   This was a huge movement in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
[01:26:00.380 --> 01:26:03.540]   Teddy Roosevelt said, Chautauqua is the most American thing
[01:26:03.540 --> 01:26:04.340]   in America.
[01:26:04.340 --> 01:26:05.980]   Well, we get the word talk.
[01:26:05.980 --> 01:26:06.820]   No, it is.
[01:26:06.820 --> 01:26:07.180]   No, it isn't.
[01:26:07.180 --> 01:26:07.780]   It didn't even work.
[01:26:07.780 --> 01:26:10.700]   But the idea was it was an assembly of people.
[01:26:10.700 --> 01:26:13.220]   They brought entertainment and culture for the whole community
[01:26:13.220 --> 01:26:17.300]   together with speakers, teachers, musicians, entertainers,
[01:26:17.300 --> 01:26:19.100]   preachers, specialists.
[01:26:19.100 --> 01:26:22.860]   They'd gather together often in a tent, sometimes in buildings,
[01:26:22.860 --> 01:26:23.740]   Chautauqua buildings.
[01:26:23.740 --> 01:26:26.340]   There's still Chautauqua institutes all over the country.
[01:26:26.340 --> 01:26:26.780]   And you know what?
[01:26:26.780 --> 01:26:27.820]   Killed it?
[01:26:27.820 --> 01:26:30.460]   Radio in the '20s.
[01:26:30.460 --> 01:26:32.700]   And I think we're in a similar situation here.
[01:26:32.700 --> 01:26:36.220]   That's the example of technology killing off something
[01:26:36.220 --> 01:26:39.020]   that solves a human problem.
[01:26:39.020 --> 01:26:42.860]   How do we formalize socialize?
[01:26:42.860 --> 01:26:44.620]   I don't know if anybody remembers this.
[01:26:44.620 --> 01:26:46.740]   But in the '90s, there was a movement where people used
[01:26:46.740 --> 01:26:48.900]   to have what they called salons.
[01:26:48.900 --> 01:26:50.740]   And there would be a bunch of smarty pants.
[01:26:50.740 --> 01:26:53.300]   And they would get together and they
[01:26:53.300 --> 01:26:54.380]   had these conversations.
[01:26:54.380 --> 01:26:55.980]   They live on as book groups, I think.
[01:26:55.980 --> 01:26:56.980]   Yeah.
[01:26:56.980 --> 01:26:58.860]   I think it would always evolve into wine spots.
[01:26:58.860 --> 01:27:01.300]   Book club seems to be basically drinking sessions
[01:27:01.300 --> 01:27:02.300]   with books in the library.
[01:27:02.300 --> 01:27:02.500]   Isn't that funny?
[01:27:02.500 --> 01:27:05.140]   That's been my experience.
[01:27:05.140 --> 01:27:05.900]   Don't get me wrong.
[01:27:05.900 --> 01:27:06.900]   This is no bad thing.
[01:27:06.900 --> 01:27:09.220]   But yeah, there's the salon movement, which
[01:27:09.220 --> 01:27:11.820]   was basically copying the 1890s, 1880s,
[01:27:11.820 --> 01:27:13.660]   sort of salon movement, which would be great.
[01:27:13.660 --> 01:27:15.900]   But that was a highfalutin.
[01:27:15.900 --> 01:27:17.420]   The thing about Chautauqua is a little bit more--
[01:27:17.420 --> 01:27:18.420]   It's for everybody.
[01:27:18.420 --> 01:27:18.420]   Yeah.
[01:27:18.420 --> 01:27:19.340]   --if folksy.
[01:27:19.340 --> 01:27:19.980]   Yes.
[01:27:19.980 --> 01:27:22.540]   I think you should launch a movement to bring back
[01:27:22.540 --> 01:27:23.900]   the Chautauqua.
[01:27:23.900 --> 01:27:27.380]   And you have this huge platform, this huge megaphone.
[01:27:27.380 --> 01:27:27.820]   Go for it.
[01:27:27.820 --> 01:27:29.140]   I'll come to your Chautauqua.
[01:27:29.140 --> 01:27:30.660]   Chautauqua.
[01:27:30.660 --> 01:27:32.940]   Well, the reason I mentioned it on the radio shows,
[01:27:32.940 --> 01:27:37.020]   because I think in a way that's what a talk radio show--
[01:27:37.020 --> 01:27:37.460]   Yeah.
[01:27:37.460 --> 01:27:39.180]   --especially if it's around a top type radio.
[01:27:39.180 --> 01:27:40.780]   It's a talk radio.
[01:27:40.780 --> 01:27:41.900]   It's really-- that's what it is.
[01:27:41.900 --> 01:27:43.860]   It's kind of getting together in just kind of community
[01:27:43.860 --> 01:27:45.460]   and talking.
[01:27:45.460 --> 01:27:46.300]   And I kind of like that.
[01:27:46.300 --> 01:27:48.060]   But I think we've lost that a little bit.
[01:27:48.060 --> 01:27:49.860]   The current social media doesn't have
[01:27:49.860 --> 01:27:51.660]   that same sensation of--
[01:27:51.660 --> 01:27:53.860]   I think what you do with podcasting in the chatroom
[01:27:53.860 --> 01:27:54.700]   is slow to get--
[01:27:54.700 --> 01:27:55.580]   This is much more folksy.
[01:27:55.580 --> 01:27:56.080]   Yeah.
[01:27:56.080 --> 01:27:58.140]   Because with podcasting-- like, radio's
[01:27:58.140 --> 01:28:01.340]   too commercialized and too desperate to make some money.
[01:28:01.340 --> 01:28:04.100]   Whereas with podcasting, you choose the topics you want
[01:28:04.100 --> 01:28:04.820]   to learn about.
[01:28:04.820 --> 01:28:07.700]   And it's genuinely educational and entertaining.
[01:28:07.700 --> 01:28:09.660]   Podcasts are almost a modern version of this,
[01:28:09.660 --> 01:28:12.020]   because they are niche focused, but they're also
[01:28:12.020 --> 01:28:12.980]   community oriented.
[01:28:12.980 --> 01:28:14.500]   And they're available to everyone for free.
[01:28:14.500 --> 01:28:15.020]   Yeah.
[01:28:15.020 --> 01:28:15.500]   Right.
[01:28:15.500 --> 01:28:17.140]   And they're also relatively unregulated.
[01:28:17.140 --> 01:28:18.900]   I mean, we can get away with saying stuff here,
[01:28:18.900 --> 01:28:21.260]   which we couldn't get away with saying on broadcast television.
[01:28:21.260 --> 01:28:22.460]   Oh, no, we'd all be in a lodge right now.
[01:28:22.460 --> 01:28:23.100]   This was going to be--
[01:28:23.100 --> 01:28:24.340]   John will yell at you, though, if you say--
[01:28:24.340 --> 01:28:25.340]   John, I know.
[01:28:25.340 --> 01:28:26.780]   --the Adjut Pie.
[01:28:26.780 --> 01:28:27.300]   Exactly.
[01:28:27.300 --> 01:28:28.940]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:28:28.940 --> 01:28:30.220]   Oh, that's a killing.
[01:28:30.220 --> 01:28:32.420]   Why are you-- he just called you a cop.
[01:28:32.420 --> 01:28:33.580]   I'm going to see his coffee response.
[01:28:33.580 --> 01:28:35.540]   Your coffee response.
[01:28:35.540 --> 01:28:38.660]   John, we need to get your giant Reese's coffee cut.
[01:28:38.660 --> 01:28:39.220]   Is it--
[01:28:39.220 --> 01:28:41.220]   He's the least popular person on Twitter.
[01:28:41.220 --> 01:28:42.580]   I want to talk about him in a second.
[01:28:42.580 --> 01:28:43.580]   We'll come back.
[01:28:43.580 --> 01:28:45.580]   And really, this is all going to be about CES.
[01:28:45.580 --> 01:28:48.220]   And I noticed that none of you are at CES right now.
[01:28:48.220 --> 01:28:48.740]   Damn right.
[01:28:48.740 --> 01:28:49.260]   We're smart.
[01:28:49.260 --> 01:28:50.100]   Starting up.
[01:28:50.100 --> 01:28:51.340]   But we'll talk about that in a second.
[01:28:51.340 --> 01:28:52.500]   First a word from our sponsor.
[01:28:52.500 --> 01:28:54.500]   Last pass.
[01:28:54.500 --> 01:28:57.180]   From time hop to my heritage to my fitness pal.
[01:28:57.180 --> 01:28:58.540]   You know that you have in common?
[01:28:58.540 --> 01:29:01.260]   Maybe if I throw in Marriott Equifax.
[01:29:01.260 --> 01:29:03.980]   Now you know these data breaches.
[01:29:03.980 --> 01:29:06.100]   Last year's data breach has affected millions of people
[01:29:06.100 --> 01:29:06.940]   around the world.
[01:29:06.940 --> 01:29:09.220]   If you're a business and you are keeping track of data,
[01:29:09.220 --> 01:29:11.620]   whether it's your data or customer's data,
[01:29:11.620 --> 01:29:13.340]   you need LastPass Enterprise.
[01:29:13.340 --> 01:29:16.620]   It makes passwords sharing convenient for employees,
[01:29:16.620 --> 01:29:19.740]   but keeps corporate data secure.
[01:29:19.740 --> 01:29:22.180]   And you will have centralized admin oversight.
[01:29:22.180 --> 01:29:23.580]   We use LastPass Enterprise here.
[01:29:23.580 --> 01:29:25.140]   We have for years.
[01:29:25.140 --> 01:29:27.220]   Ever since one of our engineers put his passwords
[01:29:27.220 --> 01:29:29.780]   on a public website because he couldn't remember them.
[01:29:29.780 --> 01:29:33.220]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:29:33.220 --> 01:29:34.420]   He realized his mistake.
[01:29:34.420 --> 01:29:36.900]   But we then got LastPass Enterprise.
[01:29:36.900 --> 01:29:40.660]   Because, of course, you want to use passwords
[01:29:40.660 --> 01:29:41.940]   you don't remember.
[01:29:41.940 --> 01:29:44.740]   You want to use long, randomly generated passwords.
[01:29:44.740 --> 01:29:46.860]   In fact, we use LastPass's password generator
[01:29:46.860 --> 01:29:48.700]   to create these crazy passwords.
[01:29:48.700 --> 01:29:49.660]   Who can remember those?
[01:29:49.660 --> 01:29:50.260]   Well, you don't have to.
[01:29:50.260 --> 01:29:52.180]   You just remember them in LastPass.
[01:29:52.180 --> 01:29:53.660]   In fact, I trust LastPass so much.
[01:29:53.660 --> 01:29:55.580]   It's encrypted only on device.
[01:29:55.580 --> 01:29:58.140]   So even the LastPass company cannot access your password
[01:29:58.140 --> 01:29:58.340]   vault.
[01:29:58.340 --> 01:30:00.380]   No one can but you.
[01:30:00.380 --> 01:30:03.460]   We require, with our admin settings,
[01:30:03.460 --> 01:30:07.380]   that you use two factor, we have master password requirements,
[01:30:07.380 --> 01:30:08.940]   two.
[01:30:08.940 --> 01:30:10.020]   That's all important.
[01:30:10.020 --> 01:30:11.980]   You actually get over 100 policies.
[01:30:11.980 --> 01:30:13.260]   You get security reports.
[01:30:13.260 --> 01:30:14.700]   You get shared folders.
[01:30:14.700 --> 01:30:16.660]   Shared folders are nice because, like our ops team
[01:30:16.660 --> 01:30:18.140]   has its shared folder.
[01:30:18.140 --> 01:30:20.220]   The business office has its shared folder.
[01:30:20.220 --> 01:30:25.420]   So all the company assets they need access to are there.
[01:30:25.420 --> 01:30:27.940]   In many cases, they don't even get to see the password
[01:30:27.940 --> 01:30:28.620]   or know the password.
[01:30:28.620 --> 01:30:30.860]   It just logs them into, like say, quick books,
[01:30:30.860 --> 01:30:33.340]   our accounting program automatically.
[01:30:33.340 --> 01:30:35.860]   So if we change the password, they don't have to know about it.
[01:30:35.860 --> 01:30:37.060]   And if they leave the company, they
[01:30:37.060 --> 01:30:40.220]   have no way to get into it, which is fantastic.
[01:30:40.220 --> 01:30:41.420]   Two factor authentication.
[01:30:41.420 --> 01:30:42.740]   We support multi-factor.
[01:30:42.740 --> 01:30:43.900]   We require it.
[01:30:43.900 --> 01:30:46.420]   LastPass integrates with a variety of authentication
[01:30:46.420 --> 01:30:50.900]   providers to offer flexible multi-factor options.
[01:30:50.900 --> 01:30:53.060]   They also have an authenticator app that's awesome.
[01:30:53.060 --> 01:30:55.300]   Instead of a number, it sends you a push notification
[01:30:55.300 --> 01:30:56.460]   a prover deny.
[01:30:56.460 --> 01:30:58.380]   You press the approve button you're in.
[01:30:58.380 --> 01:31:01.140]   And even if somebody got your passwords
[01:31:01.140 --> 01:31:04.580]   without the two factor authentication,
[01:31:04.580 --> 01:31:06.420]   they wouldn't be able to get your stuff.
[01:31:06.420 --> 01:31:08.140]   I just love it.
[01:31:08.140 --> 01:31:09.820]   If you use Active Directory in your company,
[01:31:09.820 --> 01:31:11.340]   Microsoft's Active Directory, you
[01:31:11.340 --> 01:31:13.700]   can log into LastPass with your AD credentials
[01:31:13.700 --> 01:31:16.260]   for a single sign-on experience.
[01:31:16.260 --> 01:31:18.020]   Because the data is encrypted and decrypted
[01:31:18.020 --> 01:31:21.060]   at the device level, because it's so secure-- and we had Steve
[01:31:21.060 --> 01:31:24.460]   Gibson actually get together with a creator of LastPass,
[01:31:24.460 --> 01:31:27.460]   Joe Seigres, look at the source code and vet it for us.
[01:31:27.460 --> 01:31:28.580]   And he said, thumbs up.
[01:31:28.580 --> 01:31:29.780]   He uses it now.
[01:31:29.780 --> 01:31:32.540]   Because it's so secure, I keep my passport in there.
[01:31:32.540 --> 01:31:34.700]   I keep my driver's license, social security numbers,
[01:31:34.700 --> 01:31:37.060]   everything in LastPass.
[01:31:37.060 --> 01:31:38.580]   Protect your business.
[01:31:38.580 --> 01:31:40.020]   They have an enterprise solution,
[01:31:40.020 --> 01:31:42.300]   but they also have LastPass teams for teams
[01:31:42.300 --> 01:31:43.980]   a little smaller, 50 or fewer.
[01:31:43.980 --> 01:31:46.460]   LastPass premium for your home users.
[01:31:46.460 --> 01:31:49.300]   And at home, we use LastPass families for the whole family.
[01:31:49.300 --> 01:31:51.100]   That way, everybody, including the 16-year-old,
[01:31:51.100 --> 01:31:53.300]   gets LastPass--
[01:31:53.300 --> 01:31:55.340]   actually, the ex-husband also gets LastPass.
[01:31:55.340 --> 01:31:57.180]   We're very friendly that way.
[01:31:57.180 --> 01:32:00.020]   It's awesome, because things like--
[01:32:00.020 --> 01:32:04.500]   when Lisa needs access to the Comcast account,
[01:32:04.500 --> 01:32:06.180]   it's shared with her automatically.
[01:32:06.180 --> 01:32:07.420]   So she gets access to it.
[01:32:07.420 --> 01:32:08.540]   I don't have to think about it.
[01:32:08.540 --> 01:32:09.380]   She has what she needs.
[01:32:09.380 --> 01:32:10.300]   I have what I need.
[01:32:10.300 --> 01:32:10.820]   I love it.
[01:32:10.820 --> 01:32:11.700]   You're going to love it.
[01:32:11.700 --> 01:32:15.780]   43,000 businesses, leading tech brands like MailChimp
[01:32:15.780 --> 01:32:19.820]   and Fortune 500 companies and Twit, use LastPass.
[01:32:19.820 --> 01:32:23.500]   It's the number one most preferred password manager,
[01:32:23.500 --> 01:32:26.020]   LastPass.com/Twit.
[01:32:26.020 --> 01:32:29.980]   Find the best password solution for your team at LastPass.com/Twit.
[01:32:29.980 --> 01:32:32.340]   If you're coming to RSA, by the way,
[01:32:32.340 --> 01:32:35.700]   come to the LastPass cocktail party at Bourbon and Branch.
[01:32:35.700 --> 01:32:36.900]   We went last year with so much fun.
[01:32:36.900 --> 01:32:38.020]   We're going to go again this year,
[01:32:38.020 --> 01:32:39.980]   and I'm bringing Jason and Megan as well.
[01:32:39.980 --> 01:32:41.460]   So you can come say hi.
[01:32:41.460 --> 01:32:43.060]   Oh, I'm totally doing that.
[01:32:43.060 --> 01:32:44.380]   A couple of quick things about passwords.
[01:32:44.380 --> 01:32:50.060]   I just got published a, I hope, well-researched piece
[01:32:50.060 --> 01:32:52.140]   about passwords and the myths around passwords.
[01:32:52.140 --> 01:32:52.900]   Is this--
[01:32:52.900 --> 01:32:54.700]   It's on security intelligence.
[01:32:54.700 --> 01:32:56.980]   Time to dispel these dangerous password security myths
[01:32:56.980 --> 01:32:59.500]   by Mike Elgin.
[01:32:59.500 --> 01:33:02.980]   Anyway, one of the most interesting myths, I think,
[01:33:02.980 --> 01:33:05.060]   is that people think a long, complicated password
[01:33:05.060 --> 01:33:06.380]   is always really secure.
[01:33:06.380 --> 01:33:07.900]   But they're not.
[01:33:07.900 --> 01:33:09.820]   When if you write your own, chances
[01:33:09.820 --> 01:33:12.220]   are it may not be all that secure according to some research
[01:33:12.220 --> 01:33:12.740]   that's been done.
[01:33:12.740 --> 01:33:14.100]   It's actually really interesting.
[01:33:14.100 --> 01:33:17.260]   If you let LastPass create the password, it's going to be secure.
[01:33:17.260 --> 01:33:20.460]   Yes, because it's a completely random combination
[01:33:20.460 --> 01:33:24.140]   of upper and lowercase numbers and punctuation, your choice.
[01:33:24.140 --> 01:33:27.820]   And I also make them really long, like 40, 50, as long as the site--
[01:33:27.820 --> 01:33:29.300]   It doesn't matter if you're using--
[01:33:29.300 --> 01:33:31.060]   It doesn't matter, so that's it.
[01:33:31.060 --> 01:33:33.740]   Another myth is that password managers,
[01:33:33.740 --> 01:33:37.140]   LastPass, the leading one, have solved the problem.
[01:33:37.140 --> 01:33:39.380]   But the only reason they haven't solved the problems
[01:33:39.380 --> 01:33:41.740]   of passwords is because not enough people use them.
[01:33:41.740 --> 01:33:43.140]   People don't use them.
[01:33:43.140 --> 01:33:45.420]   And so that problem is still there because people are not
[01:33:45.420 --> 01:33:45.980]   using them.
[01:33:45.980 --> 01:33:48.260]   This is from your own article.
[01:33:48.260 --> 01:33:51.700]   86% of Americans rely on memorization.
[01:33:51.700 --> 01:33:54.140]   It's terrible.
[01:33:54.140 --> 01:33:56.860]   This is as crazy as giving your credit card to the waiter
[01:33:56.860 --> 01:33:57.420]   in the restaurant.
[01:33:57.420 --> 01:33:57.980]   But you know what that tells me?
[01:33:57.980 --> 01:34:00.620]   If they rely on memorization, they're using--
[01:34:00.620 --> 01:34:01.700]   Easy to crack passwords.
[01:34:01.700 --> 01:34:02.220]   Easy passwords.
[01:34:02.220 --> 01:34:03.900]   It's an in-your-dog with you.
[01:34:03.900 --> 01:34:05.100]   Exactly.
[01:34:05.100 --> 01:34:06.860]   There's some research on this at Defgon
[01:34:06.860 --> 01:34:09.100]   where they were saying about where you've
[01:34:09.100 --> 01:34:11.300]   got to put the upper case locates on the symbol.
[01:34:11.300 --> 01:34:13.820]   In about 40% of the cases, the symbol
[01:34:13.820 --> 01:34:15.780]   is always an exclamation point at the end
[01:34:15.780 --> 01:34:17.060]   because that's easy to remember.
[01:34:17.060 --> 01:34:17.980]   And easy to guess.
[01:34:17.980 --> 01:34:20.460]   And password crackers are smart to this.
[01:34:20.460 --> 01:34:22.340]   And that's one of the assumptions they'll make
[01:34:22.340 --> 01:34:23.500]   when they're trying to brute force them.
[01:34:23.500 --> 01:34:25.820]   And there's a new kind of AI that's out there called GANS,
[01:34:25.820 --> 01:34:27.940]   which can easily crack any sort of new--
[01:34:27.940 --> 01:34:28.460]   Really?
[01:34:28.460 --> 01:34:29.660]   --there are this.
[01:34:29.660 --> 01:34:31.580]   Unless they're really good.
[01:34:31.580 --> 01:34:35.540]   So GANS is-- let me see if I can explain this clearly.
[01:34:35.540 --> 01:34:36.980]   GANS is a type of technology.
[01:34:36.980 --> 01:34:39.620]   Stands for generative adversarial networks.
[01:34:39.620 --> 01:34:40.620]   That's right.
[01:34:40.620 --> 01:34:42.380]   They have two machine learning algorithms
[01:34:42.380 --> 01:34:43.900]   that go against each other.
[01:34:43.900 --> 01:34:46.820]   One is trying to create fake data.
[01:34:46.820 --> 01:34:48.380]   And the other one's testing that data.
[01:34:48.380 --> 01:34:50.540]   And they both make each other better and better and better
[01:34:50.540 --> 01:34:52.060]   and better and better to the point
[01:34:52.060 --> 01:34:53.740]   where the one that can create fake data
[01:34:53.740 --> 01:34:58.020]   creates such great fake data that they can actually crack
[01:34:58.020 --> 01:34:59.180]   fingerprints.
[01:34:59.180 --> 01:34:59.700]   Yeah.
[01:34:59.700 --> 01:35:01.700]   It'll actually generate fake fingerprints
[01:35:01.700 --> 01:35:05.260]   that are very likely to pass as real fingerprints.
[01:35:05.260 --> 01:35:08.220]   And then it just runs 100,000 fake fingerprints against it
[01:35:08.220 --> 01:35:09.180]   and cracks the fingerprint.
[01:35:09.180 --> 01:35:10.940]   Because one of them is going to get through.
[01:35:10.940 --> 01:35:12.780]   Because the fingerprint-- anyway,
[01:35:12.780 --> 01:35:18.620]   but remember this acronym GANS.
[01:35:18.620 --> 01:35:20.220]   This is the GANS painting.
[01:35:20.220 --> 01:35:20.700]   Yeah.
[01:35:20.700 --> 01:35:22.580]   This painting is created by GANS.
[01:35:22.580 --> 01:35:25.940]   GANS is also the technology behind the deep fake videos.
[01:35:25.940 --> 01:35:26.500]   Oh, really?
[01:35:26.500 --> 01:35:27.380]   Yes.
[01:35:27.380 --> 01:35:31.220]   This is the AI technology that's really changing things.
[01:35:31.220 --> 01:35:32.700]   And it's coming a little faster than that.
[01:35:32.700 --> 01:35:36.300]   And generative because it's two artificial intelligence,
[01:35:36.300 --> 01:35:37.260]   two neural networks.
[01:35:37.260 --> 01:35:38.100]   Exactly.
[01:35:38.100 --> 01:35:40.060]   Working kind of adversely.
[01:35:40.060 --> 01:35:40.620]   Exactly.
[01:35:40.620 --> 01:35:43.100]   And together, they both get better and better and better
[01:35:43.100 --> 01:35:45.620]   and better to the point where the one that's creating fake data
[01:35:45.620 --> 01:35:49.060]   makes such great fake data that it's better than the real thing.
[01:35:49.060 --> 01:35:51.620]   The other thing I want to say about LastPass,
[01:35:51.620 --> 01:35:55.500]   because I'm a dedicated user, is I want to speak to my tribe,
[01:35:55.500 --> 01:35:56.900]   the lazy.
[01:35:56.900 --> 01:36:00.020]   Because you just set it up with a fingerprint
[01:36:00.020 --> 01:36:02.100]   and everything you have that has a password,
[01:36:02.100 --> 01:36:03.820]   you just touch the back of your phone and you're awesome.
[01:36:03.820 --> 01:36:05.340]   Oh, the private phone in Fairland, Iowa.
[01:36:05.340 --> 01:36:05.860]   Exactly.
[01:36:05.860 --> 01:36:07.580]   Yeah, Face ID works with it too.
[01:36:07.580 --> 01:36:07.980]   Yeah.
[01:36:07.980 --> 01:36:09.660]   So that's the best thing I've heard all day.
[01:36:09.660 --> 01:36:10.660]   Yeah.
[01:36:10.660 --> 01:36:11.140]   Great.
[01:36:11.140 --> 01:36:12.340]   This is a good article.
[01:36:12.340 --> 01:36:13.260]   I'm going to have to deal that life.
[01:36:13.260 --> 01:36:14.740]   Security intelligence.
[01:36:14.740 --> 01:36:19.020]   Mike Elgin, it's time to dispel these dangerous password security myths.
[01:36:19.020 --> 01:36:22.020]   I'm going to quote you on the radio show, because it's fantastic.
[01:36:22.020 --> 01:36:24.100]   I mean, I think everybody who watches our show
[01:36:24.100 --> 01:36:25.780]   probably already uses LastPass.
[01:36:25.780 --> 01:36:27.340]   And certainly knows if they don't--
[01:36:27.340 --> 01:36:28.340]   They should.
[01:36:28.340 --> 01:36:29.380]   --that they should be using it.
[01:36:29.380 --> 01:36:32.460]   Or there are good--
[01:36:32.460 --> 01:36:33.540]   use a password manager.
[01:36:33.540 --> 01:36:34.500]   Let's say that.
[01:36:34.500 --> 01:36:35.780]   Does that be an individual brand?
[01:36:35.780 --> 01:36:36.620]   I see you making a face.
[01:36:36.620 --> 01:36:37.420]   Do you use one password?
[01:36:37.420 --> 01:36:40.180]   No, I just want to point out that the Eagles did get the touchdown.
[01:36:40.180 --> 01:36:41.380]   Oh, you were looking at the football game.
[01:36:41.380 --> 01:36:42.300]   For our 16-15.
[01:36:42.300 --> 01:36:44.380]   So people don't know, but this twin--
[01:36:44.380 --> 01:36:45.500]   That's his LastPass right there.
[01:36:45.500 --> 01:36:48.100]   This twin was scheduled in advance.
[01:36:48.100 --> 01:36:50.180]   And then my football team made it to the playoffs.
[01:36:50.180 --> 01:36:54.140]   And so I have had one quarter of one corner of my eye on this game all--
[01:36:54.140 --> 01:36:55.780]   You warned me that that would happen.
[01:36:55.780 --> 01:36:57.300]   At some point, we'd be talking about something.
[01:36:57.300 --> 01:36:57.300]   Yeah.
[01:36:57.300 --> 01:36:58.580]   And you'd make a face.
[01:36:58.580 --> 01:36:59.900]   But it wouldn't be about the topic.
[01:36:59.900 --> 01:37:00.740]   No, we'd be about--
[01:37:00.740 --> 01:37:03.660]   I've had the armored rugby game playing, you know, for climbers.
[01:37:03.660 --> 01:37:04.940]   The reason why I didn't actually--
[01:37:04.940 --> 01:37:07.260]   I thought Mike for two and a half minutes was because we
[01:37:07.260 --> 01:37:09.220]   were at this incredibly difficult scoring drive.
[01:37:09.220 --> 01:37:10.020]   And we just--
[01:37:10.020 --> 01:37:11.620]   So the Eagles are leading--
[01:37:11.620 --> 01:37:12.460]   Well, we don't want to say.
[01:37:12.460 --> 01:37:15.100]   Don't say because there are people at home who are taking--
[01:37:15.100 --> 01:37:15.900]   Watching this show.
[01:37:15.900 --> 01:37:16.420]   Oh, true.
[01:37:16.420 --> 01:37:16.980]   Oh, good boy.
[01:37:16.980 --> 01:37:17.660]   No, you're taking photos.
[01:37:17.660 --> 01:37:18.620]   It's an exciting game.
[01:37:18.620 --> 01:37:19.620]   Enjoy yourself, as well.
[01:37:19.620 --> 01:37:19.980]   It is.
[01:37:19.980 --> 01:37:21.900]   We don't know who's won because it's not over yet.
[01:37:21.900 --> 01:37:22.420]   True.
[01:37:22.420 --> 01:37:22.920]   True.
[01:37:22.920 --> 01:37:26.420]   It's a back and forth seesaw battle of the Titans.
[01:37:26.420 --> 01:37:26.980]   Yeah.
[01:37:26.980 --> 01:37:27.860]   Not incorrect.
[01:37:27.860 --> 01:37:28.460]   Totally true.
[01:37:28.460 --> 01:37:29.900]   Anyways, I will stop spoiling the game.
[01:37:29.900 --> 01:37:31.820]   But I will see my heart rate has gone down dramatically.
[01:37:31.820 --> 01:37:33.380]   And so I'm feeling at ease.
[01:37:33.380 --> 01:37:35.700]   We don't know the score was he was wrong.
[01:37:35.700 --> 01:37:37.820]   True.
[01:37:37.820 --> 01:37:38.820]   Glad about your heart rate.
[01:37:38.820 --> 01:37:39.500]   Thank you.
[01:37:39.500 --> 01:37:39.500]   Yeah.
[01:37:39.500 --> 01:37:40.700]   What is your Apple watch?
[01:37:40.700 --> 01:37:41.300]   Oh, you don't wear it?
[01:37:41.300 --> 01:37:42.260]   Oh, I don't wear an Apple watch.
[01:37:42.260 --> 01:37:42.620]   I'm not a new one.
[01:37:42.620 --> 01:37:45.540]   You remember last year at the amazing Super Bowl
[01:37:45.540 --> 01:37:48.460]   with the Phillies won that people were getting Apple
[01:37:48.460 --> 01:37:49.020]   watches seeing.
[01:37:49.020 --> 01:37:51.380]   I think you're dying.
[01:37:51.380 --> 01:37:53.020]   There's something going horribly wrong.
[01:37:53.020 --> 01:37:55.020]   You've been sitting here, but your heart rate just spiked.
[01:37:55.020 --> 01:37:56.860]   It's a metaphor for a little football.
[01:37:56.860 --> 01:37:58.140]   I love falling technology like that.
[01:37:58.140 --> 01:37:59.220]   We did a group--
[01:37:59.220 --> 01:38:00.300]   I managed to convince my editors.
[01:38:00.300 --> 01:38:02.620]   Let me do a group test on personal breathalyzers
[01:38:02.620 --> 01:38:04.620]   that link into your phone through an app.
[01:38:04.620 --> 01:38:07.700]   So convince the company to buy us some scotch, wine, and beer.
[01:38:07.700 --> 01:38:08.980]   And then we sat around the office drinking--
[01:38:08.980 --> 01:38:09.500]   Testing.
[01:38:09.500 --> 01:38:11.180]   --and blowing into these things.
[01:38:11.180 --> 01:38:14.140]   And if you take a big shot of scotch and blow
[01:38:14.140 --> 01:38:16.300]   direct immediately into the breathalyzer,
[01:38:16.300 --> 01:38:18.740]   I got it to say you're an urgent need of medical care.
[01:38:18.740 --> 01:38:20.500]   And let's go to the hospital immediately.
[01:38:20.500 --> 01:38:21.020]   And it was true.
[01:38:21.020 --> 01:38:23.500]   Your blood is now actually entirely scotch.
[01:38:23.500 --> 01:38:25.820]   Yeah.
[01:38:25.820 --> 01:38:27.220]   Microsoft is doing something.
[01:38:27.220 --> 01:38:31.420]   Speaking of passwords and privacy,
[01:38:31.420 --> 01:38:32.980]   I think this is a really interesting thing.
[01:38:32.980 --> 01:38:35.900]   Mary Jo Foley broke the story a couple of days ago.
[01:38:35.900 --> 01:38:39.100]   Codamed Bally, it's a way to give users
[01:38:39.100 --> 01:38:41.260]   control of the data collected about them.
[01:38:41.260 --> 01:38:44.980]   We were talking in Windows Weekly this week that Apple--
[01:38:44.980 --> 01:38:50.900]   if you go to CES, there is a big billboard that says what
[01:38:50.900 --> 01:38:53.260]   happens on your iPhone stays on your iPhone.
[01:38:53.260 --> 01:38:54.940]   Apple's doubling down on surprises.
[01:38:54.940 --> 01:38:57.060]   Yeah, it's not true, however.
[01:38:57.060 --> 01:38:59.260]   True or not, it's a good marketing--
[01:38:59.260 --> 01:39:02.420]   Oh, it's a great marketing thing, but it's complete bollocks.
[01:39:02.420 --> 01:39:05.460]   Other than complete lies, Zach Whitaker, who's now
[01:39:05.460 --> 01:39:07.900]   at TechCrunchable, who is one of my favorite security
[01:39:07.900 --> 01:39:08.500]   journalists--
[01:39:08.500 --> 01:39:08.980]   He is great.
[01:39:08.980 --> 01:39:12.100]   --that is a threat about how that's a bollocks advertisement.
[01:39:12.100 --> 01:39:14.020]   And I wasn't aware of all the different ways in which it
[01:39:14.020 --> 01:39:14.300]   was actually--
[01:39:14.300 --> 01:39:14.860]   Oh, yeah.
[01:39:14.860 --> 01:39:15.260]   --crappy.
[01:39:15.260 --> 01:39:16.220]   That's interesting.
[01:39:16.220 --> 01:39:16.580]   Zach's good at fantastic.
[01:39:16.580 --> 01:39:18.340]   Well, one of the problems is iCloud, which, of course,
[01:39:18.340 --> 01:39:19.900]   Apple has the keys to.
[01:39:19.900 --> 01:39:20.900]   And when you go to iCloud--
[01:39:20.900 --> 01:39:24.780]   And if you're in China, Apple and China have the keys to.
[01:39:24.780 --> 01:39:28.260]   Because all the iCloud servers are in China with access
[01:39:28.260 --> 01:39:29.700]   available to the Chinese government.
[01:39:29.700 --> 01:39:31.220]   But what else is wrong with that?
[01:39:31.220 --> 01:39:32.500]   I would have to go back and--
[01:39:32.500 --> 01:39:34.060]   Shall I go read the thread for us?
[01:39:34.060 --> 01:39:35.740]   Well, yeah, go get it.
[01:39:35.740 --> 01:39:37.500]   And I'll talk about Bali.
[01:39:37.500 --> 01:39:42.260]   We were saying on Windows Weekly that Microsoft would do well.
[01:39:42.260 --> 01:39:44.460]   Since they are-- I mean, really, the competition, Amazon,
[01:39:44.460 --> 01:39:48.500]   and Google can never say your privacy is our number one
[01:39:48.500 --> 01:39:49.540]   priority.
[01:39:49.540 --> 01:39:50.780]   Apple can say that.
[01:39:50.780 --> 01:39:52.100]   Microsoft could say that.
[01:39:52.100 --> 01:39:53.900]   They should say that.
[01:39:53.900 --> 01:39:54.380]   I don't know.
[01:39:54.380 --> 01:39:56.980]   I've been spending a good long day trying to look down
[01:39:56.980 --> 01:39:58.660]   on your Windows 10 system, so it wasn't--
[01:39:58.660 --> 01:40:00.700]   Well, they're not doing it right yet.
[01:40:00.700 --> 01:40:02.580]   They need to give you-- one of the problems
[01:40:02.580 --> 01:40:04.220]   and a lot of people complain about it in Windows 10
[01:40:04.220 --> 01:40:07.260]   is that even if you turn off all of the telemetry,
[01:40:07.260 --> 01:40:09.100]   there's some still remains.
[01:40:09.100 --> 01:40:12.460]   Microsoft really needs a button that says, no, I don't want
[01:40:12.460 --> 01:40:14.100]   you to send anything back to Microsoft.
[01:40:14.100 --> 01:40:16.140]   And they need to publicize that.
[01:40:16.140 --> 01:40:17.500]   And that's an opportunity for them.
[01:40:17.500 --> 01:40:20.060]   That Google and Amazon cannot duplicate.
[01:40:20.060 --> 01:40:21.820]   This feeds into my longstanding theory.
[01:40:21.820 --> 01:40:23.860]   I don't know if I've ever shared this with you, Leo.
[01:40:23.860 --> 01:40:25.460]   But I think a lot of people at Microsoft
[01:40:25.460 --> 01:40:27.420]   listen to Windows Weekly.
[01:40:27.420 --> 01:40:27.900]   That's true.
[01:40:27.900 --> 01:40:29.020]   I think it's very influential.
[01:40:29.020 --> 01:40:30.020]   Absolutely true.
[01:40:30.020 --> 01:40:30.500]   Yeah.
[01:40:30.500 --> 01:40:33.380]   In fact, we have every year our Christmas episode
[01:40:33.380 --> 01:40:36.700]   has the chief marketing officer, Chris Capacella.
[01:40:36.700 --> 01:40:39.140]   But I do think-- and it's not because of Twitter or me.
[01:40:39.140 --> 01:40:42.540]   It's because Mary Jo Foley and Paul Therat are very, very
[01:40:42.540 --> 01:40:44.260]   influential in the Microsoft business.
[01:40:44.260 --> 01:40:45.100]   And they're delightful.
[01:40:45.100 --> 01:40:47.100]   And they know what they're talking about.
[01:40:47.100 --> 01:40:52.260]   So the Bally project, which Mary Jo Foley found a link to--
[01:40:52.260 --> 01:40:52.900]   Microsoft.
[01:40:52.900 --> 01:40:54.260]   Nice job.
[01:40:54.260 --> 01:40:56.940]   It is described as a new personal data bank, which
[01:40:56.940 --> 01:41:00.380]   puts users in control of all the data collected about them.
[01:41:00.380 --> 01:41:02.900]   This is something a lot of people, including--
[01:41:02.900 --> 01:41:06.260]   was it Tim Berners-Lee, who's created a company to do this?
[01:41:06.260 --> 01:41:08.940]   A lot of people looked at this idea of,
[01:41:08.940 --> 01:41:11.580]   with all the privacy issues we're talking about, really,
[01:41:11.580 --> 01:41:16.100]   it's a question of selling your data for something of value.
[01:41:16.100 --> 01:41:19.300]   And the only way that'll work is if you know what data is
[01:41:19.300 --> 01:41:20.700]   being collected, you control it.
[01:41:20.700 --> 01:41:24.500]   And then you actually decide who to give that data to
[01:41:24.500 --> 01:41:26.780]   and what the value is going to be to you.
[01:41:26.780 --> 01:41:28.740]   If you can do that, I think there
[01:41:28.740 --> 01:41:31.140]   can be a reasonable conversation.
[01:41:31.140 --> 01:41:33.380]   If I know how much data Google's getting out
[01:41:33.380 --> 01:41:35.820]   of my Gmail account, and I know how much value I'm
[01:41:35.820 --> 01:41:38.980]   getting from using Gmail, then I can make a logical decision
[01:41:38.980 --> 01:41:40.500]   about whether it's worth it.
[01:41:40.500 --> 01:41:41.900]   Or I can make a trade-off.
[01:41:41.900 --> 01:41:43.860]   No ads, no data transfer, and I'll pay you--
[01:41:43.860 --> 01:41:46.060]   well, it'd be really nice to have that as well.
[01:41:46.060 --> 01:41:46.580]   That would be--
[01:41:46.580 --> 01:41:49.820]   I hope that that's the future if we get that.
[01:41:49.820 --> 01:41:52.500]   They will allow users to visualize, manage, control,
[01:41:52.500 --> 01:41:55.300]   and share and monetize the data.
[01:41:55.300 --> 01:41:57.500]   Yeah, I mean, there is a definite market
[01:41:57.500 --> 01:42:00.340]   for an operating system which doesn't constantly report back
[01:42:00.340 --> 01:42:01.060]   on you.
[01:42:01.060 --> 01:42:03.100]   Could it be that this is the year of Linux on the desktop?
[01:42:03.100 --> 01:42:04.580]   You stole my joke.
[01:42:04.580 --> 01:42:06.500]   Oh, oh, sounds sorry.
[01:42:06.500 --> 01:42:09.740]   I was like, oh, I have one.
[01:42:09.740 --> 01:42:12.620]   But seriously, I mean, there's one of the things
[01:42:12.620 --> 01:42:14.100]   I hated about Windows 10.
[01:42:14.100 --> 01:42:16.620]   It was a slow data grabby.
[01:42:16.620 --> 01:42:19.300]   They will stick adverts pretty much anywhere.
[01:42:19.300 --> 01:42:20.340]   They've got to stop doing that.
[01:42:20.340 --> 01:42:24.740]   It's not a bad operating system in itself,
[01:42:24.740 --> 01:42:27.420]   but it's the naginess and the snoopiness of it.
[01:42:27.420 --> 01:42:28.900]   It's an opportunity.
[01:42:28.900 --> 01:42:31.500]   There's a-- it's not a startup anymore.
[01:42:31.500 --> 01:42:34.460]   They've been around for a while called digi.me.
[01:42:34.460 --> 01:42:35.180]   You heard of them?
[01:42:35.180 --> 01:42:36.140]   Yes.
[01:42:36.140 --> 01:42:37.860]   D-I-G-I.ME.
[01:42:37.860 --> 01:42:39.820]   I briefly signed up, and I forgot all about it.
[01:42:39.820 --> 01:42:40.380]   Exactly.
[01:42:40.380 --> 01:42:43.780]   They just didn't have whatever it takes to go mainstream.
[01:42:43.780 --> 01:42:45.060]   But this is their idea as well.
[01:42:45.060 --> 01:42:47.220]   You collect all the stuff, and they wanted--
[01:42:47.220 --> 01:42:50.220]   their vision was to get to the point where the user would
[01:42:50.220 --> 01:42:52.700]   be in control of all their data and could sell or give
[01:42:52.700 --> 01:42:54.300]   permission and all that stuff.
[01:42:54.300 --> 01:42:56.740]   And they just had the problems.
[01:42:56.740 --> 01:43:00.300]   How do you do that without the cooperation of Facebook, Google?
[01:43:00.300 --> 01:43:00.780]   Yeah.
[01:43:00.780 --> 01:43:02.820]   Companies that make so much money, all of their money,
[01:43:02.820 --> 01:43:04.980]   basically, on selling your information.
[01:43:04.980 --> 01:43:06.940]   What's their incentive to participate
[01:43:06.940 --> 01:43:11.220]   unless governments or society or us start users
[01:43:11.220 --> 01:43:12.820]   start saying, no, we're not going to do it.
[01:43:12.820 --> 01:43:15.540]   And also, for Facebook with their shadow profiles,
[01:43:15.540 --> 01:43:18.260]   you, the user, don't have access to any information
[01:43:18.260 --> 01:43:19.740]   they know about you.
[01:43:19.740 --> 01:43:20.940]   You've got to dossier.
[01:43:20.940 --> 01:43:24.020]   And it includes information you never shared with them.
[01:43:24.020 --> 01:43:27.740]   So on Friday, we're going to do a triangulation
[01:43:27.740 --> 01:43:29.980]   with a woman named Shoshana Zuboff.
[01:43:29.980 --> 01:43:33.420]   She's a professor emerita at Harvard Business School
[01:43:33.420 --> 01:43:36.220]   and has written a new book called The Age of Surveillance
[01:43:36.220 --> 01:43:37.180]   Capitalism.
[01:43:37.180 --> 01:43:37.700]   Ooh.
[01:43:37.700 --> 01:43:42.500]   A fight for a human future at the new frontier of power.
[01:43:42.500 --> 01:43:45.140]   So she's really done a lot of work on this idea.
[01:43:45.140 --> 01:43:47.220]   And we are in a state.
[01:43:47.220 --> 01:43:49.140]   We are in a world of surveillance capitalism.
[01:43:49.140 --> 01:43:50.820]   That's how these companies make money
[01:43:50.820 --> 01:43:52.500]   is by surveilling us.
[01:43:52.500 --> 01:43:53.620]   I don't know if there's an answer,
[01:43:53.620 --> 01:43:56.540]   but we'll talk to Professor Zuboff about that.
[01:43:56.540 --> 01:43:57.340]   Are you optimistic?
[01:43:57.340 --> 01:43:58.140]   I'm just listening.
[01:43:58.140 --> 01:43:58.340]   Listen to me.
[01:43:58.340 --> 01:43:58.340]   No.
[01:43:58.340 --> 01:43:59.180]   About this Leo.
[01:43:59.180 --> 01:43:59.860]   About this whole thing.
[01:43:59.860 --> 01:44:01.780]   I gave up a long time better.
[01:44:01.780 --> 01:44:03.420]   Well, I think there's movements now.
[01:44:03.420 --> 01:44:05.580]   We're all off Facebook, there's Bali coming.
[01:44:05.580 --> 01:44:06.540]   We're all talking about this.
[01:44:06.540 --> 01:44:07.780]   We didn't talk about this five years ago.
[01:44:07.780 --> 01:44:08.900]   We just said, well, Facebook's not going to stop.
[01:44:08.900 --> 01:44:10.860]   Because, ha, ha, they're Facebook.
[01:44:10.860 --> 01:44:12.740]   Maybe there is change in their mind.
[01:44:12.740 --> 01:44:14.860]   I think people are gradually getting up
[01:44:14.860 --> 01:44:17.940]   to the point that, oh, right, OK, well, it's nice having
[01:44:17.940 --> 01:44:18.900]   the free service.
[01:44:18.900 --> 01:44:20.860]   But what's the cost to me?
[01:44:20.860 --> 01:44:22.660]   And what's the cost benefit analysis?
[01:44:22.660 --> 01:44:22.860]   Right.
[01:44:22.860 --> 01:44:24.860]   People are actually thinking about it.
[01:44:24.860 --> 01:44:26.580]   Unfortunately, the reason they're thinking about it
[01:44:26.580 --> 01:44:28.980]   is because these companies have been so egregious in the way
[01:44:28.980 --> 01:44:31.580]   that they've used this data in the past.
[01:44:31.580 --> 01:44:33.580]   But, yeah, it's hopeful possibly.
[01:44:33.580 --> 01:44:36.820]   I'm optimistic for the first time ever, I feel.
[01:44:36.820 --> 01:44:39.540]   I think us leaving the platforms is the real catalyst.
[01:44:39.540 --> 01:44:40.620]   But in the beginning of a change.
[01:44:40.620 --> 01:44:42.020]   Yeah, because they have to keep--
[01:44:42.020 --> 01:44:43.780]   I mean, I think I'm a relatively high value user
[01:44:43.780 --> 01:44:46.460]   in Facebook in terms of what I can spend.
[01:44:46.460 --> 01:44:52.860]   The key is to weaken and water down their network effect.
[01:44:52.860 --> 01:44:53.780]   And this is the thing.
[01:44:53.780 --> 01:44:56.660]   So you have to be on Facebook because everybody's on Facebook.
[01:44:56.660 --> 01:44:58.580]   But what if everybody wasn't on Facebook?
[01:44:58.580 --> 01:45:01.500]   Then suddenly, the appeal is kind of weakened significantly.
[01:45:01.500 --> 01:45:02.660]   So that's the idea.
[01:45:02.660 --> 01:45:05.020]   It's not to everybody to leave Facebook.
[01:45:05.020 --> 01:45:08.500]   It's for if 20% of the Facebook users left,
[01:45:08.500 --> 01:45:11.900]   that would really weaken the value of the service.
[01:45:11.900 --> 01:45:13.500]   I can see how that works out.
[01:45:13.500 --> 01:45:14.140]   Yeah.
[01:45:14.140 --> 01:45:16.940]   But I will say, we'll find something else as a species
[01:45:16.940 --> 01:45:18.340]   on which to communicate and mask for them.
[01:45:18.340 --> 01:45:19.900]   I don't think we're going to end up just email.
[01:45:19.900 --> 01:45:22.540]   Let me quote sci-fi author Bruce Sterling.
[01:45:22.540 --> 01:45:24.660]   I don't know if you're familiar with his yearly state
[01:45:24.660 --> 01:45:28.100]   of the world, which he usually does at South by Southwest.
[01:45:28.100 --> 01:45:29.460]   This year, he did it on the well.
[01:45:29.460 --> 01:45:30.660]   Yeah.
[01:45:30.660 --> 01:45:32.300]   And he-- Did you say the well?
[01:45:32.300 --> 01:45:33.740]   Yeah, it's still around.
[01:45:33.740 --> 01:45:34.340]   You're kidding.
[01:45:34.340 --> 01:45:35.460]   No, it's still going.
[01:45:35.460 --> 01:45:36.860]   Why didn't anybody tell me?
[01:45:36.860 --> 01:45:37.860]   I signed up.
[01:45:37.860 --> 01:45:39.740]   I finally thought a social network for my people.
[01:45:39.740 --> 01:45:41.260]   Oh, my people.
[01:45:41.260 --> 01:45:42.020]   It's not cheap.
[01:45:42.020 --> 01:45:43.780]   You say you wanted to go back to the 19th century.
[01:45:43.780 --> 01:45:45.980]   It is very 19th century.
[01:45:45.980 --> 01:45:48.660]   Here's a quote from his state of the world 2019.
[01:45:48.660 --> 01:45:49.700]   "The world is gray.
[01:45:49.700 --> 01:45:50.500]   It's become.
[01:45:50.500 --> 01:45:53.860]   It's not a fatal gloom, but it is a kind of learned helplessness,
[01:45:53.860 --> 01:45:56.820]   a malaise and bewilderment.
[01:45:56.820 --> 01:45:58.140]   It's very much the attitude of people
[01:45:58.140 --> 01:46:00.540]   who sign on to Facebook because they can't yet figure out
[01:46:00.540 --> 01:46:02.020]   any other way to live.
[01:46:02.020 --> 01:46:05.140]   They do that because they must conform to the apparent need,
[01:46:05.140 --> 01:46:07.340]   despite their vague, ox-like awareness,
[01:46:07.340 --> 01:46:10.780]   they're being spied on, tricked, and defrauded.
[01:46:10.780 --> 01:46:14.380]   This is the resigned malaise that fits the post-notin
[01:46:14.380 --> 01:46:16.900]   internet and tech industry's consolidation.
[01:46:16.900 --> 01:46:19.460]   It's the funeral aftermath of Moore's Law.
[01:46:19.460 --> 01:46:20.500]   He's a great writer.
[01:46:20.500 --> 01:46:23.340]   It resembles a fat, sweaty guy on the couch,
[01:46:23.340 --> 01:46:26.100]   snacking on poisoned cookies.
[01:46:26.100 --> 01:46:26.980]   That's how it is.
[01:46:26.980 --> 01:46:29.260]   He is a really good writer when he's on full.
[01:46:29.260 --> 01:46:34.860]   I think that's the same guy Trump said hacked the emails.
[01:46:34.860 --> 01:46:36.700]   He feels like, and he travels quite a bit
[01:46:36.700 --> 01:46:37.740]   and talks to people quite a bit.
[01:46:37.740 --> 01:46:43.300]   There is that this gray malaise spreading throughout the world.
[01:46:43.300 --> 01:46:47.500]   I hope we're not getting to a pessimistic sports ball
[01:46:47.500 --> 01:46:48.340]   people.
[01:46:48.340 --> 01:46:50.380]   If you're not watching and you're just listening,
[01:46:50.380 --> 01:46:53.620]   a ball went flying to the end and everybody got really excited.
[01:46:53.620 --> 01:46:56.260]   It bounced off of something.
[01:46:56.260 --> 01:46:58.700]   And there is a general look of gloom
[01:46:58.700 --> 01:47:00.380]   among one of the sports ball teams.
[01:47:00.380 --> 01:47:05.940]   It cuts us part out of the edit, but don't say anything.
[01:47:05.940 --> 01:47:07.900]   We're talking about malaise.
[01:47:07.900 --> 01:47:09.820]   Yeah, I'm not.
[01:47:09.820 --> 01:47:11.260]   It's malaise.
[01:47:11.260 --> 01:47:12.540]   This is a tax for me, not a candidate.
[01:47:12.540 --> 01:47:14.980]   Oh, it bounced off.
[01:47:14.980 --> 01:47:15.660]   OK.
[01:47:15.660 --> 01:47:16.180]   All right.
[01:47:16.180 --> 01:47:16.460]   That's right.
[01:47:16.460 --> 01:47:18.020]   That's right out of that Pepsi ad.
[01:47:18.020 --> 01:47:19.940]   The ice, the kick.
[01:47:19.940 --> 01:47:20.620]   So it was tech.
[01:47:20.620 --> 01:47:22.700]   Honestly, everyone being so excited about kick
[01:47:22.700 --> 01:47:23.820]   a pig's bladder round up here.
[01:47:23.820 --> 01:47:24.740]   We have four shows--
[01:47:24.740 --> 01:47:25.580]   French double-hugans.
[01:47:25.580 --> 01:47:27.900]   We used to talk about substantive issues.
[01:47:27.900 --> 01:47:29.100]   You're talking about sports ball.
[01:47:29.100 --> 01:47:30.940]   I'm like the well.
[01:47:30.940 --> 01:47:31.780]   I still like that.
[01:47:31.780 --> 01:47:32.460]   Can't believe the well.
[01:47:32.460 --> 01:47:33.300]   He's still in the show.
[01:47:33.300 --> 01:47:33.820]   He's sitting there.
[01:47:33.820 --> 01:47:37.700]   I signed up for a year at 150 Smackers.
[01:47:37.700 --> 01:47:38.380]   It's not cheap.
[01:47:38.380 --> 01:47:39.460]   Wow.
[01:47:39.460 --> 01:47:41.100]   And then I went in and I remembered, oh, this
[01:47:41.100 --> 01:47:41.900]   is why I left the well.
[01:47:41.900 --> 01:47:44.420]   I was on the well a lot in the '90s.
[01:47:44.420 --> 01:47:45.860]   It's not any better.
[01:47:45.860 --> 01:47:48.980]   It's just like Times New Roman--
[01:47:48.980 --> 01:47:49.340]   No, no.
[01:47:49.340 --> 01:47:50.180]   It looks like a note pad.
[01:47:50.180 --> 01:47:52.540]   It looks like a note pad.
[01:47:52.540 --> 01:47:54.740]   You can't really tell what people are talking about.
[01:47:54.740 --> 01:47:57.860]   You see responses without seeing the main message for--
[01:47:57.860 --> 01:48:00.140]   the threading bizarre.
[01:48:00.140 --> 01:48:02.020]   Maybe I haven't figured it out quite yet.
[01:48:02.020 --> 01:48:04.460]   But it was the first time I ever saw the internet was on the well.
[01:48:04.460 --> 01:48:06.980]   You could drop out of the well interface
[01:48:06.980 --> 01:48:08.660]   into a command line.
[01:48:08.660 --> 01:48:10.580]   And I could use gopher and Archie.
[01:48:10.580 --> 01:48:11.580]   You can't do that anymore?
[01:48:11.580 --> 01:48:12.580]   No, I don't think so.
[01:48:12.580 --> 01:48:15.460]   It's web-based now.
[01:48:15.460 --> 01:48:16.140]   Oh, well, forget it.
[01:48:16.140 --> 01:48:17.100]   I'm not joining it.
[01:48:17.100 --> 01:48:20.020]   Anyway, I think this is worth reading.
[01:48:20.020 --> 01:48:21.900]   You do have to go visit the well.
[01:48:21.900 --> 01:48:24.900]   If you search for Bruce Sterling and SOTW, State of the World,
[01:48:24.900 --> 01:48:25.380]   you can read it.
[01:48:25.380 --> 01:48:26.700]   He invited some other people.
[01:48:26.700 --> 01:48:27.820]   But he is a great writer.
[01:48:27.820 --> 01:48:30.580]   I hope he still does the South by thing,
[01:48:30.580 --> 01:48:33.180]   because it's worth going to that talk just to hear him.
[01:48:33.180 --> 01:48:34.700]   He's about the only thing worth--
[01:48:34.700 --> 01:48:35.500]   Yeah, I agree.
[01:48:35.500 --> 01:48:37.940]   Going to you at South by Southwest.
[01:48:37.940 --> 01:48:39.180]   Well, you're going to come.
[01:48:39.180 --> 01:48:41.020]   You're going to come because I think we're trying to figure out
[01:48:41.020 --> 01:48:42.740]   if we could do the Capital One House again.
[01:48:42.740 --> 01:48:45.140]   So you should come and you can be part of our panel.
[01:48:45.140 --> 01:48:45.860]   How about that?
[01:48:45.860 --> 01:48:46.260]   There you go.
[01:48:46.260 --> 01:48:47.820]   We'll do a twit from South by.
[01:48:47.820 --> 01:48:48.340]   Sure.
[01:48:48.340 --> 01:48:49.180]   That would be fun.
[01:48:49.180 --> 01:48:49.580]   Can I come?
[01:48:49.580 --> 01:48:50.220]   Can I come?
[01:48:50.220 --> 01:48:51.260]   Yes.
[01:48:51.260 --> 01:48:53.020]   I haven't been to Austin yet.
[01:48:53.020 --> 01:48:53.820]   I do hear the--
[01:48:53.820 --> 01:48:54.540]   Oh, Austin's great.
[01:48:54.540 --> 01:48:55.420]   --the food is amazing.
[01:48:55.420 --> 01:48:57.620]   Oh, you don't get to diss Austin if you've not been.
[01:48:57.620 --> 01:48:58.300]   No, no, I didn't.
[01:48:58.300 --> 01:48:59.140]   I was dissing Austin.
[01:48:59.140 --> 01:49:01.980]   This is kind of social media--
[01:49:01.980 --> 01:49:03.700]   --just widows that turn up stuff.
[01:49:03.700 --> 01:49:05.700]   But over Bruce Sterling, stay for the case, though.
[01:49:05.700 --> 01:49:06.340]   Is it worth it?
[01:49:06.340 --> 01:49:07.500]   Do you like meat?
[01:49:07.500 --> 01:49:08.500]   Oh, you love Austin.
[01:49:08.500 --> 01:49:09.260]   Oh, yeah.
[01:49:09.260 --> 01:49:09.740]   Yeah, no.
[01:49:09.740 --> 01:49:10.020]   I mean--
[01:49:10.020 --> 01:49:13.100]   He's blood sausage for our prior conversation.
[01:49:13.100 --> 01:49:15.260]   Let's take a little break.
[01:49:15.260 --> 01:49:17.420]   We had a great week this week on Twit.
[01:49:17.420 --> 01:49:18.780]   And we have a--
[01:49:18.780 --> 01:49:21.500]   I believe we've created a small movie
[01:49:21.500 --> 01:49:23.580]   so that you can see what you missed watch.
[01:49:23.580 --> 01:49:25.620]   Previously on Twit.
[01:49:25.620 --> 01:49:26.300]   Hello!
[01:49:26.300 --> 01:49:27.900]   Happy New Year.
[01:49:27.900 --> 01:49:28.620]   Did you know?
[01:49:28.620 --> 01:49:29.460]   It's a new year.
[01:49:29.460 --> 01:49:30.940]   Yes, it's a new year.
[01:49:30.940 --> 01:49:33.780]   Brand new for 2019.
[01:49:33.780 --> 01:49:35.260]   With all new hosts--
[01:49:35.260 --> 01:49:36.300]   I'm Leo LaPorte.
[01:49:36.300 --> 01:49:37.740]   That's how we fight up Stacey.
[01:49:37.740 --> 01:49:38.940]   I'm fired.
[01:49:38.940 --> 01:49:40.060]   Jeff Jarvis.
[01:49:40.060 --> 01:49:41.460]   Right now.
[01:49:41.460 --> 01:49:43.260]   Actually, it's the old hosts.
[01:49:43.260 --> 01:49:44.980]   Dude, I disappointed everybody.
[01:49:44.980 --> 01:49:45.980]   No, everybody's happy.
[01:49:45.980 --> 01:49:48.180]   Yeah, they're like, oh, new hosts.
[01:49:48.180 --> 01:49:48.900]   How exciting.
[01:49:48.900 --> 01:49:50.620]   And then, oh, it's just them.
[01:49:50.620 --> 01:49:52.300]   It's just them again.
[01:49:52.300 --> 01:49:53.900]   This week in Google.
[01:49:53.900 --> 01:49:58.620]   Weilding rocks and knives, Arizona's attack self-driving cars.
[01:49:58.620 --> 01:50:00.660]   This is-- these are the Weamo vehicles
[01:50:00.660 --> 01:50:02.340]   going around into Arizona.
[01:50:02.340 --> 01:50:04.740]   They're saying, there's debate at subjects for this.
[01:50:04.740 --> 01:50:06.700]   I guess that's a real point of view, right?
[01:50:06.700 --> 01:50:07.660]   That's reasonable.
[01:50:07.660 --> 01:50:09.460]   Lawmakers did decide this.
[01:50:09.460 --> 01:50:13.060]   So technology of companies really need to wake up
[01:50:13.060 --> 01:50:16.300]   and realize that they can't just fall back on data.
[01:50:16.300 --> 01:50:19.020]   They have to start dealing with people
[01:50:19.020 --> 01:50:22.300]   in all of our horrifyingly messy glory.
[01:50:22.300 --> 01:50:23.380]   Windows weekly.
[01:50:23.380 --> 01:50:28.220]   You too, as is your wad, have made lists for the new year.
[01:50:28.220 --> 01:50:30.140]   Predictions for Microsoft.
[01:50:30.140 --> 01:50:32.820]   When we were at Ignite, and this guy says--
[01:50:32.820 --> 01:50:33.980]   I don't know how this came up.
[01:50:33.980 --> 01:50:39.340]   He says, you know, you said that Google would never buy you two.
[01:50:39.340 --> 01:50:41.780]   I don't remember this, but man, they'll hold you.
[01:50:41.780 --> 01:50:42.620]   Beat to the fire.
[01:50:42.620 --> 01:50:44.660]   As it happens, I'm holding in my hands
[01:50:44.660 --> 01:50:46.900]   your predictions from last year.
[01:50:46.900 --> 01:50:47.500]   Are you serious?
[01:50:47.500 --> 01:50:48.500]   Yeah.
[01:50:48.500 --> 01:50:49.820]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:50:49.820 --> 01:50:52.020]   Well, look at the time.
[01:50:52.020 --> 01:50:53.020]   It's a new year to it.
[01:50:53.020 --> 01:50:54.540]   Wishing you a happy new year.
[01:50:54.540 --> 01:50:56.740]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:50:56.740 --> 01:51:00.820]   And happy new year to you too, Jim Cutler, who, as for years,
[01:51:00.820 --> 01:51:02.900]   been our booth announcer.
[01:51:02.900 --> 01:51:05.100]   Jim did all the announcing for Tech TV.
[01:51:05.100 --> 01:51:07.100]   And he very kindly--
[01:51:07.100 --> 01:51:08.380]   because he's an expensive fellow.
[01:51:08.380 --> 01:51:09.420]   I couldn't really afford him.
[01:51:09.420 --> 01:51:12.220]   He continues to do our announcing for a Twitter.
[01:51:12.220 --> 01:51:13.300]   We love Jim.
[01:51:13.300 --> 01:51:14.500]   Happy new year, Jim.
[01:51:14.500 --> 01:51:16.300]   And Don, his wife.
[01:51:16.300 --> 01:51:19.380]   Our show today brought you by Zip Recruiter.
[01:51:19.380 --> 01:51:21.380]   This is a great year to take your business
[01:51:21.380 --> 01:51:22.460]   to the next level.
[01:51:22.460 --> 01:51:25.580]   The people you hire in your company are your company.
[01:51:25.580 --> 01:51:26.540]   That's what a company is.
[01:51:26.540 --> 01:51:27.860]   It's made of people.
[01:51:27.860 --> 01:51:30.620]   And the right hire could send your company to the moon.
[01:51:30.620 --> 01:51:33.980]   Wrong hire can make it crash just as surely.
[01:51:33.980 --> 01:51:37.140]   So kick off 2019 by planning out which
[01:51:37.140 --> 01:51:39.140]   roles your business needs to hire for.
[01:51:39.140 --> 01:51:42.220]   And then, doing it smart, start the new year off strong
[01:51:42.220 --> 01:51:45.820]   by going to ziprecruiter.com/twit.
[01:51:45.820 --> 01:51:47.700]   Unlike the other job sites, Zip Recruiter
[01:51:47.700 --> 01:51:50.500]   actually finds qualified candidates for you.
[01:51:50.500 --> 01:51:53.260]   They have very powerful matching technology.
[01:51:53.260 --> 01:51:55.940]   Goes through the resumes they have on hand.
[01:51:55.940 --> 01:51:59.820]   It will identify the people who have the right skills,
[01:51:59.820 --> 01:52:03.260]   education, and experience for the job you're posting.
[01:52:03.260 --> 01:52:06.140]   And then, it goes out and says, hey, there's a great job here.
[01:52:06.140 --> 01:52:07.100]   You should apply.
[01:52:07.100 --> 01:52:10.900]   It actually invites them to apply to your job what it means.
[01:52:10.900 --> 01:52:12.020]   And we had this experience.
[01:52:12.020 --> 01:52:14.700]   We lost our bookkeeper about six months ago.
[01:52:14.700 --> 01:52:16.220]   And Lisa's kind of going, oh, now I've
[01:52:16.220 --> 01:52:17.500]   got to do the books too.
[01:52:17.500 --> 01:52:18.820]   I said, no, no, Lisa, look.
[01:52:18.820 --> 01:52:20.540]   There was a breakfast.
[01:52:20.540 --> 01:52:23.020]   Zip Recruiter, we've been advertising with us for years.
[01:52:23.020 --> 01:52:24.180]   So she went to Zip Recruiter.
[01:52:24.180 --> 01:52:25.940]   She posted the job.
[01:52:25.940 --> 01:52:29.900]   Within an hour, the candidates start coming in thanks
[01:52:29.900 --> 01:52:32.500]   to this matching algorithm.
[01:52:32.500 --> 01:52:35.260]   And she's looking at you, oh, oh, this one's good.
[01:52:35.260 --> 01:52:36.620]   Oh, this one's even better.
[01:52:36.620 --> 01:52:39.780]   By lunchtime, we had a hand, like five or six.
[01:52:39.780 --> 01:52:43.220]   It was an amazing experience.
[01:52:43.220 --> 01:52:44.660]   I am a true believer now.
[01:52:44.660 --> 01:52:47.180]   It really brought in the facets I've ever
[01:52:47.180 --> 01:52:48.860]   seen, the right candidates.
[01:52:48.860 --> 01:52:51.100]   And of course, we hired the right person fast.
[01:52:51.100 --> 01:52:53.660]   Zip Recruiter is rated number one by employers in the US.
[01:52:53.660 --> 01:52:56.780]   And you better believe Twit will always use it.
[01:52:56.780 --> 01:52:58.340]   In fact, number one on Trust Pilot,
[01:52:58.340 --> 01:52:59.500]   over 1,000 reviews.
[01:52:59.500 --> 01:53:00.780]   That's pretty good.
[01:53:00.780 --> 01:53:03.620]   Find out what you need, who you need,
[01:53:03.620 --> 01:53:05.660]   to take your business to the next level in 2019
[01:53:05.660 --> 01:53:07.860]   and hire them fast at Zip Recruiter.
[01:53:07.860 --> 01:53:10.140]   Right now, you can try it free.
[01:53:10.140 --> 01:53:12.740]   Again, you've got to go to zipprecruiter.com/twit
[01:53:12.740 --> 01:53:16.500]   for that free offer, zipprecruiter.com/twit.
[01:53:16.500 --> 01:53:21.500]   Show your support and help the best business you can
[01:53:21.500 --> 01:53:23.460]   with the best people from Zip Recruiter.
[01:53:23.460 --> 01:53:28.460]   Zip Recruiter.com/twits, the smartest way to hire.
[01:53:28.460 --> 01:53:31.020]   By the way, cheered her up immensely.
[01:53:31.020 --> 01:53:32.500]   Not doing the books?
[01:53:32.500 --> 01:53:33.500]   Not doing the books.
[01:53:33.500 --> 01:53:34.340]   Not doing the books.
[01:53:34.340 --> 01:53:36.740]   Made her very, very, very happy.
[01:53:36.740 --> 01:53:41.540]   Strangely enough, Congress has been busy with other stuff.
[01:53:41.540 --> 01:53:43.620]   We're not doing other stuff.
[01:53:43.620 --> 01:53:46.140]   Didn't pass a copyright extension law.
[01:53:46.140 --> 01:53:48.780]   So, as of a couple of days ago,
[01:53:48.780 --> 01:53:53.780]   a number of works from not everything from 1923
[01:53:53.780 --> 01:53:56.740]   became public domain.
[01:53:56.740 --> 01:53:58.980]   Oh my gosh, what falls inside them?
[01:53:58.980 --> 01:54:01.220]   Great. I'm sorry, 1922, yeah.
[01:54:01.220 --> 01:54:02.700]   The great guy has Steamboat Willie.
[01:54:02.700 --> 01:54:05.500]   Yeah, well, Steamboat Willie's 1924.
[01:54:05.500 --> 01:54:07.180]   So this is what will be interesting to watch.
[01:54:07.180 --> 01:54:10.540]   There is no sunny bono anymore to get the copyright
[01:54:10.540 --> 01:54:11.380]   extension law.
[01:54:11.380 --> 01:54:12.500]   That's what happened last time.
[01:54:12.500 --> 01:54:13.740]   There will only be one sunny boat.
[01:54:13.740 --> 01:54:15.380]   It's the first time in 21 years.
[01:54:15.380 --> 01:54:19.500]   In 21 years, the first time that anything's gone
[01:54:19.500 --> 01:54:23.140]   into the public domain in two more than two decades.
[01:54:23.140 --> 01:54:24.940]   That's what the house significant is.
[01:54:24.940 --> 01:54:25.980]   I'm going to put Alex on this,
[01:54:25.980 --> 01:54:29.060]   because if you create something fine,
[01:54:29.060 --> 01:54:32.140]   but give it 25 years and then it goes public domain.
[01:54:32.140 --> 01:54:33.420]   Some of the arguments they're putting forward
[01:54:33.420 --> 01:54:37.420]   for 80 years public domain are not me even maintaining
[01:54:37.420 --> 01:54:39.420]   the copyright after the author's dead.
[01:54:39.420 --> 01:54:40.100]   That's ridiculous.
[01:54:40.100 --> 01:54:42.700]   F. Scott Fitzgerald is no longer benefiting
[01:54:42.700 --> 01:54:43.740]   from the great guy to the state.
[01:54:43.740 --> 01:54:48.220]   The state is right, but it's like the great Gatsby January 2021,
[01:54:48.220 --> 01:54:51.860]   two years off, Rhapsody in Blue next January.
[01:54:51.860 --> 01:54:54.900]   The sun also rises in 2022, but the big one is going to be
[01:54:54.900 --> 01:54:56.700]   January 1st, 2024.
[01:54:56.700 --> 01:54:58.460]   That's when not only Steamboat Willie,
[01:54:58.460 --> 01:55:02.300]   but also Superman and Batman and Snow White.
[01:55:02.300 --> 01:55:05.220]   Whoa, that's going to lead to an awful of good films.
[01:55:05.220 --> 01:55:08.540]   Well, this is the interesting thing.
[01:55:08.540 --> 01:55:12.580]   In the past, of course, Disney based their entire work
[01:55:12.580 --> 01:55:14.340]   on other people's work, even by the way,
[01:55:14.340 --> 01:55:16.500]   I should point out Steamboat Willie was stolen.
[01:55:16.500 --> 01:55:16.860]   True.
[01:55:16.860 --> 01:55:19.380]   But Grims for Eattails, public domain.
[01:55:19.380 --> 01:55:21.300]   They were able to make Cinderella and Snow White,
[01:55:21.300 --> 01:55:23.220]   but then they pulled the ladder up behind them,
[01:55:23.220 --> 01:55:24.100]   made it copyright.
[01:55:24.100 --> 01:55:24.500]   Exactly.
[01:55:24.500 --> 01:55:27.060]   And every time this has come up,
[01:55:27.060 --> 01:55:28.540]   they've got Congress to extend it.
[01:55:28.540 --> 01:55:30.180]   The last one was Sunny Bono's
[01:55:30.180 --> 01:55:33.020]   Copyright Term Extension Act in 1999.
[01:55:33.020 --> 01:55:38.260]   That added 20 years, keeping everything locked up until January 1st.
[01:55:38.260 --> 01:55:42.100]   So it is 1923, works are now coming into public domain.
[01:55:42.100 --> 01:55:43.860]   I'm probably in the minority.
[01:55:43.860 --> 01:55:48.060]   But I'd love to see a blockbuster movie of The Great Gatsby
[01:55:48.060 --> 01:55:52.660]   starring Superman, Batman and Snow White.
[01:55:52.660 --> 01:55:53.900]   I did not know where that was going.
[01:55:53.900 --> 01:55:54.460]   That was pretty cool.
[01:55:54.460 --> 01:55:55.620]   That would be a great opening party scene.
[01:55:55.620 --> 01:55:56.540]   I would watch this.
[01:55:56.540 --> 01:55:57.660]   By the way, I have to correct myself.
[01:55:57.660 --> 01:56:01.780]   Sunny Bono was already dead when the copyright extension term was passed.
[01:56:01.780 --> 01:56:04.900]   He died in 1998, so Congress to honor him
[01:56:04.900 --> 01:56:08.260]   went in honor to name the copyright speaker.
[01:56:08.260 --> 01:56:10.540]   So it's such a different time.
[01:56:10.540 --> 01:56:14.260]   It was a different time back in the 20th century.
[01:56:14.260 --> 01:56:15.980]   So this is interesting.
[01:56:15.980 --> 01:56:19.860]   Apparently, you can take some credit for this.
[01:56:19.860 --> 01:56:21.820]   The internet takes some credit for this.
[01:56:21.820 --> 01:56:23.580]   The Motion Picture Association of America,
[01:56:23.580 --> 01:56:25.340]   the Recording Industry Association of America,
[01:56:25.340 --> 01:56:27.780]   the authors guild, all of whom have been
[01:56:27.780 --> 01:56:32.900]   ones to lobby for the extension in the past, gave up.
[01:56:32.900 --> 01:56:35.940]   It's not something we're pursuing, said the RIAA,
[01:56:35.940 --> 01:56:39.620]   because there's now a well-organized grassroots
[01:56:39.620 --> 01:56:43.060]   lobby against copyright extension.
[01:56:43.060 --> 01:56:45.420]   There are large business interests, Google,
[01:56:45.420 --> 01:56:49.020]   now on the anti-expansion side, also a wide popular movement
[01:56:49.020 --> 01:56:50.700]   they can tie it into.
[01:56:50.700 --> 01:56:53.180]   The internet activism.
[01:56:53.180 --> 01:56:55.180]   Yep.
[01:56:55.180 --> 01:56:56.100]   The net roots.
[01:56:56.100 --> 01:56:58.460]   Net roots, I think that's a good thing.
[01:56:58.460 --> 01:57:01.420]   This is why sites like TechDirt, they really keep task on this stuff.
[01:57:01.420 --> 01:57:02.100]   Thank you, Mike.
[01:57:02.100 --> 01:57:04.100]   Yeah, really appreciate the work that's there.
[01:57:04.100 --> 01:57:05.700]   I just suppose the important acts of journalism
[01:57:05.700 --> 01:57:07.940]   that do lead to change and how we think about things.
[01:57:07.940 --> 01:57:11.060]   Because the RIAA is not notorious for its cuddliness,
[01:57:11.060 --> 01:57:13.460]   its politeness, its unwillingness to give away profits.
[01:57:13.460 --> 01:57:15.060]   But we're going to get some of our stuff back
[01:57:15.060 --> 01:57:16.700]   into our own culture that we made.
[01:57:16.700 --> 01:57:18.180]   It should be tied to commercial benefits.
[01:57:18.180 --> 01:57:20.140]   It was interesting, the Motion Picture
[01:57:20.140 --> 01:57:22.940]   House of America really did back down on this,
[01:57:22.940 --> 01:57:24.940]   and they were just like, you know, this is--
[01:57:24.940 --> 01:57:25.740]   We're not going to win.
[01:57:25.740 --> 01:57:26.740]   It's costing us too.
[01:57:26.740 --> 01:57:28.500]   Well, it's costing them an awful lot in terms
[01:57:28.500 --> 01:57:30.620]   of legal fees and false positives.
[01:57:30.620 --> 01:57:33.540]   When the RIAA did that big anti-piracy campaign,
[01:57:33.540 --> 01:57:35.260]   started suing people for downloading,
[01:57:35.260 --> 01:57:36.820]   they lost a ton of money on that.
[01:57:36.820 --> 01:57:39.340]   The only people that got rich on that were lawyers.
[01:57:39.340 --> 01:57:44.300]   And they also created a massive amount of ill will.
[01:57:44.300 --> 01:57:46.340]   I mean, Metallica's reputation took a massive hit.
[01:57:46.340 --> 01:57:47.100]   No kidding.
[01:57:47.100 --> 01:57:47.460]   Yeah.
[01:57:47.460 --> 01:57:50.220]   Lars Ulrich said it was the biggest mistake I ever made.
[01:57:50.220 --> 01:57:50.660]   Yeah.
[01:57:50.660 --> 01:57:51.420]   Pursuing the abstract.
[01:57:51.420 --> 01:57:52.500]   You just talked into it.
[01:57:52.500 --> 01:57:54.820]   Yeah, and that includes the last album.
[01:57:54.820 --> 01:57:54.940]   But--
[01:57:54.940 --> 01:57:56.380]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:57:56.380 --> 01:57:58.820]   How much more time do we have on the show to debate that point?
[01:57:58.820 --> 01:57:59.460]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:57:59.460 --> 01:58:01.580]   We'll talk CES, and then we're going to wrap it up.
[01:58:01.580 --> 01:58:03.420]   You, none of you were at CES.
[01:58:03.420 --> 01:58:05.700]   It was a condition of my job when I joined the register
[01:58:05.700 --> 01:58:06.740]   that I did not do CES.
[01:58:06.740 --> 01:58:07.500]   That's what I'm wondering.
[01:58:07.500 --> 01:58:10.300]   Are you being punished or rewarded?
[01:58:10.300 --> 01:58:13.860]   Kind of unofficially began last night with the CEA,
[01:58:13.860 --> 01:58:16.620]   the Consumer Electronics Association, own event.
[01:58:16.620 --> 01:58:17.100]   Right.
[01:58:17.100 --> 01:58:17.860]   They do a preview.
[01:58:17.860 --> 01:58:20.220]   And then tonight, it'll be PEPCOM.
[01:58:20.220 --> 01:58:21.740]   Tomorrow night, it'll be showstoppers.
[01:58:21.740 --> 01:58:22.980]   There will be tomorrow.
[01:58:22.980 --> 01:58:24.380]   Tomorrow night is also the press day,
[01:58:24.380 --> 01:58:26.300]   which is when they do all the press conferences.
[01:58:26.300 --> 01:58:29.180]   And traditionally, the Wi-Fi network falls over at 10 AM.
[01:58:29.180 --> 01:58:30.020]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:58:30.020 --> 01:58:32.180]   And that list is the best part if you're in the press,
[01:58:32.180 --> 01:58:34.260]   because that's where they're free alcohol and free shrimp
[01:58:34.260 --> 01:58:35.220]   and stuff like that.
[01:58:35.220 --> 01:58:38.380]   But also, Sony, LG, a lot of companies
[01:58:38.380 --> 01:58:40.100]   are doing press conferences tomorrow.
[01:58:40.100 --> 01:58:43.620]   Then Tuesday, the show floor opens.
[01:58:43.620 --> 01:58:47.500]   And then everybody goes home exhausted,
[01:58:47.500 --> 01:58:49.780]   having walked 400 miles.
[01:58:49.780 --> 01:58:51.980]   And the ladies' negotiable infection
[01:58:51.980 --> 01:58:54.540]   take their prices back down to the previous EEA level.
[01:58:54.540 --> 01:58:56.060]   Yeah, I just was looking at prices.
[01:58:56.060 --> 01:58:56.540]   It was funny.
[01:58:56.540 --> 01:58:57.860]   I was looking at hotel prices.
[01:58:57.860 --> 01:58:58.580]   Hotel prices.
[01:58:58.580 --> 01:58:59.260]   Not, not.
[01:58:59.260 --> 01:59:02.220]   Tonight, I could get a room in Las Vegas for $119.
[01:59:02.220 --> 01:59:04.260]   But if I try to do it Tuesday night,
[01:59:04.260 --> 01:59:06.780]   it's over $1,000 at the hotel I was doing.
[01:59:06.780 --> 01:59:08.940]   Same room.
[01:59:08.940 --> 01:59:10.060]   This is the Cosmopolitan.
[01:59:10.060 --> 01:59:10.580]   Surfride.
[01:59:10.580 --> 01:59:11.060]   Surfride.
[01:59:11.060 --> 01:59:12.700]   Yeah, you've got to look those out.
[01:59:12.700 --> 01:59:13.220]   Algorithms.
[01:59:13.220 --> 01:59:17.700]   I talked to a couple of cabbies who say we hate CES.
[01:59:17.700 --> 01:59:18.660]   He says, on the other hand, they're
[01:59:18.660 --> 01:59:20.620]   a lot more fun than the NAB show attendees.
[01:59:20.620 --> 01:59:22.220]   So that's their good thing there.
[01:59:22.220 --> 01:59:23.540]   That's the broadcasters show.
[01:59:23.540 --> 01:59:26.020]   Apparently, the CES folks are more--
[01:59:26.020 --> 01:59:27.460]   Well, they have more corporate cards, I think.
[01:59:27.460 --> 01:59:28.740]   Tech has a dirty span.
[01:59:28.740 --> 01:59:29.260]   Yeah.
[01:59:29.260 --> 01:59:31.220]   Def-colon Black Hat really freaks out the controversy.
[01:59:31.220 --> 01:59:34.140]   They expect 180,000 attendees.
[01:59:34.140 --> 01:59:36.060]   But many more will be there.
[01:59:36.060 --> 01:59:39.260]   Well, over 200,000 people-- actually, maybe even 250,000
[01:59:39.260 --> 01:59:41.860]   people coming into town for this.
[01:59:41.860 --> 01:59:43.540]   So you don't want to go.
[01:59:43.540 --> 01:59:43.820]   No.
[01:59:43.820 --> 01:59:44.900]   Why not?
[01:59:44.900 --> 01:59:46.780]   It's too big.
[01:59:46.780 --> 01:59:49.380]   There is too much rubbish there,
[01:59:49.380 --> 01:59:51.820]   like the internet-connected toilets and the rest of it.
[01:59:51.820 --> 01:59:53.180]   By the way, that's one of the big.
[01:59:53.180 --> 01:59:55.300]   In fact, probably will be the one that gets all the coverage.
[01:59:55.300 --> 01:59:57.820]   The new Kohler toilet and Alexa-enabled toilet.
[01:59:57.820 --> 01:59:58.100]   Yes.
[01:59:58.100 --> 01:59:59.300]   The breakout problems are there.
[01:59:59.300 --> 02:00:02.340]   Possibly the most ridiculous products of the year so far.
[02:00:02.340 --> 02:00:04.260]   But it's basically too big.
[02:00:04.260 --> 02:00:06.540]   From a journalist perspective, the press day
[02:00:06.540 --> 02:00:08.860]   is an absolute nightmare because you've got a queue for two
[02:00:08.860 --> 02:00:10.060]   hours to get into a press conference.
[02:00:10.060 --> 02:00:11.260]   And then when you get to the door,
[02:00:11.260 --> 02:00:12.940]   you're told the thing is full.
[02:00:12.940 --> 02:00:15.140]   But the conference floor itself, it's a sales conference.
[02:00:15.140 --> 02:00:17.700]   It's not about introducing new products
[02:00:17.700 --> 02:00:19.500]   and trying to get buyers to sell them.
[02:00:19.500 --> 02:00:22.060]   If you want to get mobbed on the CES show floor,
[02:00:22.060 --> 02:00:23.300]   you wear a buyer's badge.
[02:00:23.300 --> 02:00:24.660]   You don't wear a press badge.
[02:00:24.660 --> 02:00:25.140]   Yeah.
[02:00:25.140 --> 02:00:27.740]   They don't want the press there, and they make that fairly--
[02:00:27.740 --> 02:00:31.300]   And most of the products announced are not available yet,
[02:00:31.300 --> 02:00:32.540]   may not be available ever.
[02:00:32.540 --> 02:00:33.940]   A lot of them are just prototypes.
[02:00:33.940 --> 02:00:35.900]   And because you've got 200,000 people,
[02:00:35.900 --> 02:00:38.100]   everyone comes back with a case of conference cough.
[02:00:38.100 --> 02:00:42.260]   And the biggest reason not to go if you're a press is the reason--
[02:00:42.260 --> 02:00:45.300]   I don't care that I'm blacklisted from Apple events either.
[02:00:45.300 --> 02:00:46.460]   There's literally nothing--
[02:00:46.460 --> 02:00:47.220]   You do?
[02:00:47.220 --> 02:00:47.700]   Yeah.
[02:00:47.700 --> 02:00:48.220]   No.
[02:00:48.220 --> 02:00:49.860]   You're literally nothing you're going to find out there.
[02:00:49.860 --> 02:00:51.340]   Thanks.
[02:00:51.340 --> 02:00:54.020]   That isn't available just with a quick, easy search.
[02:00:54.020 --> 02:00:54.540]   I mean--
[02:00:54.540 --> 02:00:56.300]   I think there are people listening and watching who
[02:00:56.300 --> 02:01:00.340]   are saying, oh, you guys, it's just sour grapes.
[02:01:00.340 --> 02:01:01.420]   You don't get to go.
[02:01:01.420 --> 02:01:02.940]   You just don't want to go.
[02:01:02.940 --> 02:01:03.940]   Are you kidding?
[02:01:03.940 --> 02:01:06.380]   I would pay not to go to CES.
[02:01:06.380 --> 02:01:09.020]   I love sour grapes.
[02:01:09.020 --> 02:01:11.220]   But the reason why I get the wine in front of them--
[02:01:11.220 --> 02:01:12.500]   The reason why I'm glad I don't go anymore
[02:01:12.500 --> 02:01:14.060]   is that I always went there, but I never really
[02:01:14.060 --> 02:01:15.820]   covered consumer electronics.
[02:01:15.820 --> 02:01:17.300]   And so I was always kind of faking it,
[02:01:17.300 --> 02:01:18.660]   and I would get assigned to these keynotes.
[02:01:18.660 --> 02:01:20.540]   I'd go cover the Qualcomm keynote.
[02:01:20.540 --> 02:01:22.740]   So I'd get crammed into the back of some Godforsacking
[02:01:22.740 --> 02:01:24.420]   conference room in some terrible hotel,
[02:01:24.420 --> 02:01:27.660]   sit on the floor with bad Wi-Fi, and write about chips,
[02:01:27.660 --> 02:01:28.820]   which I don't understand.
[02:01:28.820 --> 02:01:29.740]   And that was part of my--
[02:01:29.740 --> 02:01:30.740]   Yeah, it was just part of my story.
[02:01:30.740 --> 02:01:32.380]   So we're all basically PTSD.
[02:01:32.380 --> 02:01:33.540]   Yes, the reason why I got that.
[02:01:33.540 --> 02:01:34.540]   It's the reason why I got that.
[02:01:34.540 --> 02:01:36.060]   It's for a different audience.
[02:01:36.060 --> 02:01:39.180]   And should we be paying attention, though, to the news
[02:01:39.180 --> 02:01:40.540]   that's coming out of CES this week?
[02:01:40.540 --> 02:01:41.620]   Because there will be a lot of it.
[02:01:41.620 --> 02:01:42.420]   There will be a lot of it.
[02:01:42.420 --> 02:01:45.460]   I would find out what you're interested in,
[02:01:45.460 --> 02:01:48.540]   but expect the fact that half the products that are reported
[02:01:48.540 --> 02:01:50.140]   on will never exist.
[02:01:50.140 --> 02:01:51.860]   The other quarter of the arrest of them
[02:01:51.860 --> 02:01:54.340]   are going to be so poor as to be unusable.
[02:01:54.340 --> 02:01:56.380]   And stuff like the internet connected toilet
[02:01:56.380 --> 02:01:57.900]   is just so full of--
[02:01:57.900 --> 02:01:58.900]   Well, I can't say it.
[02:01:58.900 --> 02:02:01.380]   And there will be thousands of articles about it.
[02:02:01.380 --> 02:02:02.780]   And there's nothing that going there
[02:02:02.780 --> 02:02:05.420]   will give you that you can't get from those thousands
[02:02:05.420 --> 02:02:05.980]   of articles.
[02:02:05.980 --> 02:02:06.620]   Exactly.
[02:02:06.620 --> 02:02:07.220]   And so it's--
[02:02:07.220 --> 02:02:09.940]   There's no hands-on or butt-on testing in this case.
[02:02:09.940 --> 02:02:10.140]   Well--
[02:02:10.140 --> 02:02:10.940]   Yeah.
[02:02:10.940 --> 02:02:12.420]   Yeah, but they're not going to let
[02:02:12.420 --> 02:02:14.260]   journalists drop trial and give it a shot.
[02:02:14.260 --> 02:02:14.780]   Are they?
[02:02:14.780 --> 02:02:15.540]   What if you didn't ask?
[02:02:15.540 --> 02:02:15.700]   No.
[02:02:15.700 --> 02:02:17.660]   What if you just went for it?
[02:02:17.660 --> 02:02:18.980]   What would happen that you tell me?
[02:02:18.980 --> 02:02:19.620]   Your blacklisted--
[02:02:19.620 --> 02:02:21.900]   It's not always easier to ask for forgiveness
[02:02:21.900 --> 02:02:23.420]   in these cases.
[02:02:23.420 --> 02:02:24.820]   Can we get a backup unit in here?
[02:02:24.820 --> 02:02:25.900]   Yeah, exactly.
[02:02:25.900 --> 02:02:26.100]   I mean--
[02:02:26.100 --> 02:02:27.980]   So what is that site you're showing, Carson?
[02:02:27.980 --> 02:02:29.100]   Because I want to see this--
[02:02:29.100 --> 02:02:33.580]   [INAUDIBLE]
[02:02:33.580 --> 02:02:36.100]   The IEEE Spectrum.
[02:02:36.100 --> 02:02:36.900]   Wow.
[02:02:36.900 --> 02:02:39.820]   That's the International Association of Engineering--
[02:02:39.820 --> 02:02:40.620]   We lost your--
[02:02:40.620 --> 02:02:41.460]   Electrical Engineering.
[02:02:41.460 --> 02:02:41.980]   It was the engineering.
[02:02:41.980 --> 02:02:42.940]   It had brush.
[02:02:42.940 --> 02:02:43.940]   And you know--
[02:02:43.940 --> 02:02:45.260]   So smart yogurt.
[02:02:45.260 --> 02:02:45.540]   What?
[02:02:45.540 --> 02:02:49.380]   The bizarre toothbrush, the smart yogurt maker,
[02:02:49.380 --> 02:02:52.220]   and wrist wearables on my must-see list rights,
[02:02:52.220 --> 02:02:58.180]   teclapary, really.
[02:02:58.180 --> 02:03:01.340]   I think there will be a lot of IOT things.
[02:03:01.340 --> 02:03:01.860]   I'm sure--
[02:03:01.860 --> 02:03:02.380]   Oh, bounce it.
[02:03:02.380 --> 02:03:04.300]   --healbe's Go-Be 3 wristband.
[02:03:04.300 --> 02:03:11.540]   It promises to track calorie intake, hydration,
[02:03:11.540 --> 02:03:15.260]   and stress along with sleep and activity.
[02:03:15.260 --> 02:03:16.420]   Calorie intake.
[02:03:16.420 --> 02:03:18.020]   See, I would get a wristband that was telling me
[02:03:18.020 --> 02:03:19.540]   how much I'd eaten.
[02:03:19.540 --> 02:03:20.900]   How does it do that, though?
[02:03:20.900 --> 02:03:21.900]   It's not going to work.
[02:03:21.900 --> 02:03:22.900]   It's going to say--
[02:03:22.900 --> 02:03:24.180]   It's not like you can say.
[02:03:24.180 --> 02:03:25.900]   Right, OK, you put that amount of dressing
[02:03:25.900 --> 02:03:27.300]   on that amount of salad there for that.
[02:03:27.300 --> 02:03:28.300]   That's the amount of--
[02:03:28.300 --> 02:03:30.220]   You can tell by the tilt of your wrist how much dressing
[02:03:30.220 --> 02:03:32.220]   is not going to work.
[02:03:32.220 --> 02:03:33.460]   Yeah.
[02:03:33.460 --> 02:03:36.140]   That's the problem, as these companies promise everything.
[02:03:36.140 --> 02:03:36.980]   Yeah, exactly.
[02:03:36.980 --> 02:03:38.460]   It promised the moon and delivered--
[02:03:38.460 --> 02:03:41.060]   --members wave bracelet is a bracelet
[02:03:41.060 --> 02:03:44.500]   that heats and cools because they claim
[02:03:44.500 --> 02:03:49.100]   if your wrist is hot or cold, the rest of you follows.
[02:03:49.100 --> 02:03:50.500]   Obviously, never met my wife.
[02:03:50.500 --> 02:03:52.380]   She has hands like ice at night.
[02:03:52.380 --> 02:03:53.860]   It is.
[02:03:53.860 --> 02:03:55.500]   So I want to shame bracelet.
[02:03:55.500 --> 02:03:57.340]   I know I want to just strap things on the tongue
[02:03:57.340 --> 02:03:58.180]   and then I'm a fat jerk.
[02:03:58.180 --> 02:03:59.020]   A shame bracelet.
[02:03:59.020 --> 02:04:01.100]   Like, yeah, you know that chicken tender?
[02:04:01.100 --> 02:04:01.820]   I don't think so.
[02:04:01.820 --> 02:04:05.900]   Kerry also writes the categorization of everything, or KOE.
[02:04:05.900 --> 02:04:08.780]   Once again, meets the internet of things, IOT.
[02:04:08.780 --> 02:04:13.300]   To spawn a kitchen gadget, Yomi's yogurt maker
[02:04:13.300 --> 02:04:16.980]   is the KOE IOT winner this year.
[02:04:16.980 --> 02:04:19.140]   Make it home yogurt.
[02:04:19.140 --> 02:04:20.500]   I don't know if this is going to take off.
[02:04:20.500 --> 02:04:23.860]   It can produce the currently popular Greek style yogurt.
[02:04:23.860 --> 02:04:26.300]   And the pods dispose of themselves
[02:04:26.300 --> 02:04:28.460]   by dissolving in the milk.
[02:04:28.460 --> 02:04:29.780]   Oh, just what I want.
[02:04:29.780 --> 02:04:30.460]   Oh, really?
[02:04:30.460 --> 02:04:31.020]   The hot yogurt.
[02:04:31.020 --> 02:04:32.460]   The packaging in my yogurt.
[02:04:32.460 --> 02:04:34.060]   It's the milk.
[02:04:34.060 --> 02:04:36.340]   Eliminating waste and avoiding a common complaint
[02:04:36.340 --> 02:04:38.180]   against the coffee pod gadgets.
[02:04:38.180 --> 02:04:40.660]   The worst categorization that I've seen
[02:04:40.660 --> 02:04:42.740]   is a tortilla maker, which has--
[02:04:42.740 --> 02:04:44.900]   the masa comes in a little canister
[02:04:44.900 --> 02:04:46.460]   and has different flavors like this, please.
[02:04:46.460 --> 02:04:47.420]   Oh, California or whatever.
[02:04:47.420 --> 02:04:50.100]   So it's like they're trying to find that niche market
[02:04:50.100 --> 02:04:53.820]   of people who want the convenience of store-bought tortillas
[02:04:53.820 --> 02:04:56.460]   or rather the junk food aspect of the--
[02:04:56.460 --> 02:04:58.100]   You're not talking about the rotymatic.
[02:04:58.100 --> 02:04:58.900]   No, it's called the--
[02:04:58.900 --> 02:04:59.740]   I don't know what it's called.
[02:04:59.740 --> 02:05:00.540]   It came out of like the--
[02:05:00.540 --> 02:05:02.060]   When is this coming?
[02:05:02.060 --> 02:05:04.540]   I was told we would be getting one.
[02:05:04.540 --> 02:05:05.180]   No, no, no.
[02:05:05.180 --> 02:05:06.260]   What is our rotymatic coming?
[02:05:06.260 --> 02:05:07.460]   This makes roty.
[02:05:07.460 --> 02:05:11.180]   Makes roty, which are the flat pancake breads.
[02:05:11.180 --> 02:05:13.740]   But it could be also roty-pory pizza.
[02:05:13.740 --> 02:05:15.140]   It's not going to be roty.
[02:05:15.140 --> 02:05:15.900]   The whole point of the--
[02:05:15.900 --> 02:05:16.900]   The tortillas.
[02:05:16.900 --> 02:05:19.060]   You have a giant clay pot and you light fires around it
[02:05:19.060 --> 02:05:20.300]   and you slap it to the side.
[02:05:20.300 --> 02:05:21.300]   That's what makes it roty.
[02:05:21.300 --> 02:05:23.260]   Well, they've already made 37,000,000,
[02:05:23.260 --> 02:05:26.020]   $32,371 rotys.
[02:05:26.020 --> 02:05:27.060]   It's the most popular--
[02:05:27.060 --> 02:05:28.420]   Were they edible, of course.
[02:05:28.420 --> 02:05:29.820]   It's the one guy making all that.
[02:05:29.820 --> 02:05:31.020]   Well, we're getting one.
[02:05:31.020 --> 02:05:31.580]   We're getting one.
[02:05:31.580 --> 02:05:33.580]   I don't know if that'll be part of the CES.
[02:05:33.580 --> 02:05:37.580]   Lumen's breath analyzer for a mere $250.
[02:05:37.580 --> 02:05:39.540]   When you do the rotymatic, how come on that week?
[02:05:39.540 --> 02:05:40.020]   Yeah.
[02:05:40.020 --> 02:05:40.780]   Because I will eat that.
[02:05:40.780 --> 02:05:43.020]   Mr. Carbahydre, you do not eat carbs.
[02:05:43.020 --> 02:05:44.100]   Are you lots of carbs?
[02:05:44.100 --> 02:05:45.700]   No, actually that's a lie.
[02:05:45.700 --> 02:05:46.740]   I could tell you're keto, baby.
[02:05:46.740 --> 02:05:48.700]   You skipped the top product in 10 seconds.
[02:05:48.700 --> 02:05:49.180]   No, I'm drinking carbs.
[02:05:49.180 --> 02:05:51.100]   What's the top product of CES?
[02:05:51.100 --> 02:05:51.820]   The toothbrush.
[02:05:51.820 --> 02:05:55.500]   The toothbrush that cleans your teeth in 10 seconds?
[02:05:55.500 --> 02:05:56.380]   Here's another example.
[02:05:56.380 --> 02:05:59.220]   I covered this like eight months ago on my newsletter
[02:05:59.220 --> 02:06:01.260]   when it was on Kickstarter.
[02:06:01.260 --> 02:06:03.980]   And it's like old news.
[02:06:03.980 --> 02:06:04.780]   This is the promising--
[02:06:04.780 --> 02:06:07.420]   Wait, the whole reason this can do it in 10 seconds
[02:06:07.420 --> 02:06:11.020]   is because the brush goes all the way around your teeth.
[02:06:11.020 --> 02:06:12.060]   Brushes every tooth at the same time.
[02:06:12.060 --> 02:06:14.220]   It brushes them all at once.
[02:06:14.220 --> 02:06:15.300]   It's so stupid.
[02:06:15.300 --> 02:06:18.540]   It's a mouth guard with bristles.
[02:06:18.540 --> 02:06:20.580]   It's a car wash for your face.
[02:06:20.580 --> 02:06:21.980]   Sounds like an assault.
[02:06:21.980 --> 02:06:22.980]   Yeah.
[02:06:22.980 --> 02:06:24.380]   Let's see the video card.
[02:06:24.380 --> 02:06:26.860]   Let's see the video for the Y brush.
[02:06:26.860 --> 02:06:27.340]   Why not?
[02:06:27.340 --> 02:06:29.340]   How does it brush the inside of your teeth?
[02:06:29.340 --> 02:06:31.020]   It's a good name because I'm like, why?
[02:06:31.020 --> 02:06:32.380]   Why?
[02:06:32.380 --> 02:06:36.060]   Oh, by the way, a very important optimal toothpaste
[02:06:36.060 --> 02:06:38.740]   distribution or OTD.
[02:06:38.740 --> 02:06:40.460]   Three mosesonic vibration.
[02:06:40.460 --> 02:06:42.380]   I know certain people would be happy with that.
[02:06:42.380 --> 02:06:45.740]   And this is how everybody in the 21st century
[02:06:45.740 --> 02:06:46.740]   is going to look.
[02:06:46.740 --> 02:06:48.460]   Oh, it has bristles on both sides.
[02:06:48.460 --> 02:06:49.140]   That's why.
[02:06:49.140 --> 02:06:50.060]   All done.
[02:06:50.060 --> 02:06:50.500]   Good, great.
[02:06:50.500 --> 02:06:51.500]   Deep cleaning action.
[02:06:51.500 --> 02:06:52.140]   All done.
[02:06:52.140 --> 02:06:54.180]   How lazy do you have to bake?
[02:06:54.180 --> 02:06:56.620]   What if you have a crown?
[02:06:56.620 --> 02:06:58.580]   What's the base method?
[02:06:58.580 --> 02:06:59.620]   It's antibacterial.
[02:06:59.620 --> 02:07:00.860]   It's waterproof.
[02:07:00.860 --> 02:07:03.820]   You know, anything with soap on it is antibacterial, by the way.
[02:07:03.820 --> 02:07:04.820]   Nice.
[02:07:04.820 --> 02:07:05.300]   You know.
[02:07:05.300 --> 02:07:07.580]   But it's like anything can be part of a calorie controlled
[02:07:07.580 --> 02:07:08.460]   diet.
[02:07:08.460 --> 02:07:08.940]   Yeah.
[02:07:08.940 --> 02:07:10.580]   I thought I wasn't going to--
[02:07:10.580 --> 02:07:11.100]   sorry.
[02:07:11.100 --> 02:07:12.700]   Yes, I didn't have to deal with all of this stuff.
[02:07:12.700 --> 02:07:13.540]   And now we're bringing C--
[02:07:13.540 --> 02:07:14.500]   I'm making you--
[02:07:14.500 --> 02:07:15.900]   I'm making you--
[02:07:15.900 --> 02:07:16.540]   Suffer through?
[02:07:16.540 --> 02:07:17.540]   Suffer through.
[02:07:17.540 --> 02:07:18.060]   All right.
[02:07:18.060 --> 02:07:20.220]   And the other thing is, people are watching that now.
[02:07:20.220 --> 02:07:22.180]   People are watching the podcast or listening to the podcast
[02:07:22.180 --> 02:07:23.340]   thinking, yeah, sounds OK.
[02:07:23.340 --> 02:07:23.980]   I could go ahead.
[02:07:23.980 --> 02:07:25.340]   I'd like to see that.
[02:07:25.340 --> 02:07:28.700]   I should point out, the one reason that crap like this
[02:07:28.700 --> 02:07:32.620]   gets so much press is because it is featured
[02:07:32.620 --> 02:07:34.820]   at these two pre-show events--
[02:07:34.820 --> 02:07:35.820]   Yes.
[02:07:35.820 --> 02:07:37.980]   --pePCOM and showstoppers.
[02:07:37.980 --> 02:07:40.300]   And a little bit less at the CEA event.
[02:07:40.300 --> 02:07:43.580]   And press is lazy, and they want to file early.
[02:07:43.580 --> 02:07:45.540]   So they go to these pre-show events,
[02:07:45.540 --> 02:07:47.940]   whatever is nearest the door, that's
[02:07:47.940 --> 02:07:49.300]   going to get all the attention--
[02:07:49.300 --> 02:07:50.060]   That's true.
[02:07:50.060 --> 02:07:51.260]   --in defense of the press, though.
[02:07:51.260 --> 02:07:53.540]   I mean, you go to CS, and basically--
[02:07:53.540 --> 02:07:54.980]   You have not a chance of getting around.
[02:07:54.980 --> 02:07:56.780]   Well, there's 100,000 things to cover.
[02:07:56.780 --> 02:07:59.580]   And it's like, which tiny fraction of a percentage
[02:07:59.580 --> 02:08:00.300]   are you going to cover?
[02:08:00.300 --> 02:08:01.580]   You have to decide.
[02:08:01.580 --> 02:08:04.180]   The companies that actually pay money
[02:08:04.180 --> 02:08:07.300]   to be in these events are not going to be the no name--
[02:08:07.300 --> 02:08:09.020]   $10,000 in many things.
[02:08:09.020 --> 02:08:09.540]   Yeah.
[02:08:09.540 --> 02:08:11.100]   So if they're putting up money like that,
[02:08:11.100 --> 02:08:12.180]   there's something behind it.
[02:08:12.180 --> 02:08:15.020]   They're much better than average as a CES product,
[02:08:15.020 --> 02:08:16.180]   if they're in those events.
[02:08:16.180 --> 02:08:17.220]   If you see a product--
[02:08:17.220 --> 02:08:18.220]   Plus, it's true.
[02:08:18.220 --> 02:08:19.220]   --it's much better.
[02:08:19.220 --> 02:08:19.540]   Well, yeah.
[02:08:19.540 --> 02:08:21.740]   I mean, if you see a product at the PEPCOM
[02:08:21.740 --> 02:08:25.420]   or the other parties, you know that they are almost
[02:08:25.420 --> 02:08:28.260]   certainly going to make it to final production.
[02:08:28.260 --> 02:08:29.900]   And as you say, yes, the feeling of drinking is very good.
[02:08:29.900 --> 02:08:30.660]   So the only reason this comes to mind
[02:08:30.660 --> 02:08:31.900]   is because a couple of years ago,
[02:08:31.900 --> 02:08:34.100]   we sent a couple of reporters down to CES,
[02:08:34.100 --> 02:08:34.820]   and they came back.
[02:08:34.820 --> 02:08:37.940]   The top story was the happy spoon or the happy--
[02:08:37.940 --> 02:08:38.580]   Yeah.
[02:08:38.580 --> 02:08:40.460]   The haptic vibrating spoon or something.
[02:08:40.460 --> 02:08:41.460]   The vibrating spoon.
[02:08:41.460 --> 02:08:44.700]   Because it was the first thing in the door at PEPCOM.
[02:08:44.700 --> 02:08:45.700]   There it is.
[02:08:45.700 --> 02:08:48.060]   Whatever happened to that.
[02:08:48.060 --> 02:08:48.780]   The happy fork.
[02:08:48.780 --> 02:08:50.740]   Is the weight loss fork?
[02:08:50.740 --> 02:08:51.540]   What is it?
[02:08:51.540 --> 02:08:51.740]   I'm just--
[02:08:51.740 --> 02:08:53.180]   I think we just go like that when it's
[02:08:53.180 --> 02:08:54.180]   thinking you've had enough.
[02:08:54.180 --> 02:08:56.020]   I don't think it took the world by storm.
[02:08:56.020 --> 02:08:56.780]   I'm just saying.
[02:08:56.780 --> 02:08:57.180]   Yeah.
[02:08:57.180 --> 02:08:59.620]   It does like emblematic of everything CES.
[02:08:59.620 --> 02:09:00.620]   Yeah.
[02:09:00.620 --> 02:09:01.380]   It's a smart fork.
[02:09:01.380 --> 02:09:02.380]   Everything we've talked about.
[02:09:02.380 --> 02:09:03.300]   Everything we've talked about.
[02:09:03.300 --> 02:09:04.740]   Everything we've talked about.
[02:09:04.740 --> 02:09:05.180]   Yeah.
[02:09:05.180 --> 02:09:06.180]   There you go.
[02:09:06.180 --> 02:09:07.740]   It's really a junk show.
[02:09:07.740 --> 02:09:10.660]   But there will be a lot, I think, of IoT stuff.
[02:09:10.660 --> 02:09:13.180]   There will be a home automation stuff, as there always is.
[02:09:13.180 --> 02:09:17.260]   Cars are huge at CES and a lot of automation and headends
[02:09:17.260 --> 02:09:19.180]   and all sorts of things.
[02:09:19.180 --> 02:09:20.100]   It's also worth it.
[02:09:20.100 --> 02:09:21.140]   TVs?
[02:09:21.140 --> 02:09:22.060]   TVs will be big.
[02:09:22.060 --> 02:09:24.020]   I mean, one of the things I did find--
[02:09:24.020 --> 02:09:25.740]   well, coming back onto TVs, I was there.
[02:09:25.740 --> 02:09:29.060]   I don't know if anyone else was there when the whole 3D TV
[02:09:29.060 --> 02:09:29.620]   push was.
[02:09:29.620 --> 02:09:30.100]   Yeah.
[02:09:30.100 --> 02:09:31.300]   CES was all about 3D TVs.
[02:09:31.300 --> 02:09:31.780]   That's over.
[02:09:31.780 --> 02:09:32.780]   That's over.
[02:09:32.780 --> 02:09:34.300]   You know what it is this year?
[02:09:34.300 --> 02:09:35.180]   8K.
[02:09:35.180 --> 02:09:35.700]   Ugh.
[02:09:35.700 --> 02:09:36.300]   8K.
[02:09:36.300 --> 02:09:37.260]   That's the big technology.
[02:09:37.260 --> 02:09:38.260]   It's too many K.
[02:09:38.260 --> 02:09:39.260]   Yeah.
[02:09:39.260 --> 02:09:40.260]   5G and 8K.
[02:09:40.260 --> 02:09:41.260]   5G and 8K.
[02:09:41.260 --> 02:09:44.500]   It's a match made in heaven.
[02:09:44.500 --> 02:09:48.620]   We will have next week Father Robert Ballisare, who is at CES.
[02:09:48.620 --> 02:09:51.460]   He has a deal with God.
[02:09:51.460 --> 02:09:54.100]   He's allowed to come to CES once a year and then come beyond
[02:09:54.100 --> 02:09:55.780]   our show to talk about it.
[02:09:55.780 --> 02:10:01.140]   Also Sherlyn Lowe, who's great and also will be, I think, just back from CES.
[02:10:01.140 --> 02:10:03.820]   And Stacey Higginbotham, who will also, she covers IoT.
[02:10:03.820 --> 02:10:05.060]   She's on our Twitch show.
[02:10:05.060 --> 02:10:08.380]   All three of them will be here next week to talk about.
[02:10:08.380 --> 02:10:09.380]   Yes.
[02:10:09.380 --> 02:10:11.380]   In between, just set up for them.
[02:10:11.380 --> 02:10:12.380]   What a set up, you guys.
[02:10:12.380 --> 02:10:13.940]   It's going to be a show to remember.
[02:10:13.940 --> 02:10:17.420]   Just make sure you've got your vitamins up to spec and everyone's using
[02:10:17.420 --> 02:10:20.220]   Hank Denzer because you always come back sick for CES.
[02:10:20.220 --> 02:10:21.220]   I'll be wearing them back.
[02:10:21.220 --> 02:10:22.220]   Yeah.
[02:10:22.220 --> 02:10:23.220]   It's true.
[02:10:23.220 --> 02:10:24.220]   Hey, this has been a lot of fun.
[02:10:24.220 --> 02:10:26.860]   You guys are some of my best friends and it's great to see you.
[02:10:26.860 --> 02:10:29.580]   Alex Wilhelm lives in my childhood home.
[02:10:29.580 --> 02:10:30.660]   He's living the dream.
[02:10:30.660 --> 02:10:33.340]   He's editor-in-chief at Crashbase News.
[02:10:33.340 --> 02:10:35.580]   We need to give me a new factoid at some point.
[02:10:35.580 --> 02:10:36.580]   I'm slightly creepy.
[02:10:36.580 --> 02:10:38.660]   That's the greatest factoid ever.
[02:10:38.660 --> 02:10:39.660]   He's not squatting there.
[02:10:39.660 --> 02:10:40.660]   He's living there legitimately.
[02:10:40.660 --> 02:10:41.660]   True.
[02:10:41.660 --> 02:10:42.660]   I pay taxes.
[02:10:42.660 --> 02:10:43.660]   Yeah.
[02:10:43.660 --> 02:10:44.660]   You pay taxes.
[02:10:44.660 --> 02:10:46.500]   And in Rhode Island, that's not an insignificant amount of money.
[02:10:46.500 --> 02:10:48.820]   Property taxes are steep.
[02:10:48.820 --> 02:10:52.700]   We thank you so much for being here and continue to do great work at Crunchbase News.
[02:10:52.700 --> 02:10:55.260]   Thank you for all of that too.
[02:10:55.260 --> 02:10:58.860]   Mike Elgin, he is our Gastronomad.
[02:10:58.860 --> 02:10:59.860]   Gastronomad.net.
[02:10:59.860 --> 02:11:02.460]   Elgin.com writes, as you can see, for a lot of publications.
[02:11:02.460 --> 02:11:03.460]   But he does it on the road.
[02:11:03.460 --> 02:11:05.340]   He's always traveling back to Mexico City.
[02:11:05.340 --> 02:11:07.300]   Back to Mexico City, please join us.
[02:11:07.300 --> 02:11:09.740]   It's already filling up in March.
[02:11:09.740 --> 02:11:12.780]   And all I can promise is the time of your life.
[02:11:12.780 --> 02:11:17.580]   Eating, drinking all day, learning, and destroying the best stuff in my next year.
[02:11:17.580 --> 02:11:21.060]   Gastronomad.net and click on experiences.
[02:11:21.060 --> 02:11:23.580]   And March 26th through the 31st.
[02:11:23.580 --> 02:11:24.740]   And it's a small group.
[02:11:24.740 --> 02:11:28.020]   And that margaret is actual size on your screen.
[02:11:28.020 --> 02:11:30.380]   So we've got really actual size.
[02:11:30.380 --> 02:11:31.380]   It's huge.
[02:11:31.380 --> 02:11:32.380]   Come on, Mike.
[02:11:32.380 --> 02:11:33.780]   I'm doing china rigorita moment.
[02:11:33.780 --> 02:11:37.260]   I've never been happier for the surface.
[02:11:37.260 --> 02:11:41.780]   But really, with these experiences, if you're a foodie, this is unlike...
[02:11:41.780 --> 02:11:42.780]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:11:42.780 --> 02:11:44.780]   It actually happened.
[02:11:44.780 --> 02:11:47.220]   Your tongue did a gesture.
[02:11:47.220 --> 02:11:49.780]   That was a tongue gesture.
[02:11:49.780 --> 02:11:51.540]   Don't lick your screen.
[02:11:51.540 --> 02:11:55.540]   It's hard not to when it's a margarita the size of your head.
[02:11:55.540 --> 02:11:57.460]   I'm just drawing January at the moment.
[02:11:57.460 --> 02:11:58.460]   This is painful.
[02:11:58.460 --> 02:11:59.460]   No, it's just...
[02:11:59.460 --> 02:12:00.460]   Just talk to me.
[02:12:00.460 --> 02:12:01.300]   I'll work through it.
[02:12:01.300 --> 02:12:05.420]   We learn to make tacos from one of the greatest chefs in Mexico.
[02:12:05.420 --> 02:12:07.420]   We learn all about chilies.
[02:12:07.420 --> 02:12:08.660]   Everything is amazing.
[02:12:08.660 --> 02:12:09.660]   I can't wait.
[02:12:09.660 --> 02:12:11.820]   Gastronomad.net.
[02:12:11.820 --> 02:12:12.820]   I want to do Morocco.
[02:12:12.820 --> 02:12:14.340]   You do Morocco next.
[02:12:14.340 --> 02:12:16.220]   Prosecco again.
[02:12:16.220 --> 02:12:17.220]   Provence.
[02:12:17.220 --> 02:12:19.140]   Cavabar Solona.
[02:12:19.140 --> 02:12:20.580]   Incredible.
[02:12:20.580 --> 02:12:22.140]   We love those wine countries.
[02:12:22.140 --> 02:12:23.380]   Yeah, I wonder why.
[02:12:23.380 --> 02:12:24.380]   Wine country is the best country.
[02:12:24.380 --> 02:12:27.460]   And Ian Thompson, who is the king of the English breakfast.
[02:12:27.460 --> 02:12:28.460]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:12:28.460 --> 02:12:30.460]   If it comes to blood sauce...
[02:12:30.460 --> 02:12:31.460]   My mother will be so proud.
[02:12:31.460 --> 02:12:35.980]   Back, bacon, soggy toast, scrambled eggs.
[02:12:35.980 --> 02:12:36.980]   A cool...
[02:12:36.980 --> 02:12:38.140]   I've never scrambled.
[02:12:38.140 --> 02:12:39.140]   Who was fried?
[02:12:39.140 --> 02:12:40.140]   Fried.
[02:12:40.140 --> 02:12:41.140]   Paired me.
[02:12:41.140 --> 02:12:42.780]   He's the man to go to.
[02:12:42.780 --> 02:12:46.580]   You'll find his work at the register.co.uk's new senator there.
[02:12:46.580 --> 02:12:48.580]   And it's always a pleasure to have you here.
[02:12:48.580 --> 02:12:50.980]   Always great fun being here, yeah.
[02:12:50.980 --> 02:12:53.100]   We do twit every Sunday afternoon.
[02:12:53.100 --> 02:12:55.180]   We're back in action now, the 2019 episode.
[02:12:55.180 --> 02:12:57.820]   I didn't even mention it, but this is episode 700.
[02:12:57.820 --> 02:12:58.820]   Wow.
[02:12:58.820 --> 02:13:00.820]   I love that makes it...
[02:13:00.820 --> 02:13:02.820]   You're all in the 700 club.
[02:13:02.820 --> 02:13:03.820]   That's right.
[02:13:03.820 --> 02:13:06.820]   I just want to meet something else over here.
[02:13:06.820 --> 02:13:11.180]   We do the show every Sunday afternoon, 3 p.m. Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern.
[02:13:11.180 --> 02:13:12.980]   That's 2300 UTC.
[02:13:12.980 --> 02:13:14.140]   We'd love it if you watch live.
[02:13:14.140 --> 02:13:15.140]   You're always welcome to.
[02:13:15.140 --> 02:13:16.140]   You get that way.
[02:13:16.140 --> 02:13:17.140]   You get all the stuff we get it out later.
[02:13:17.140 --> 02:13:18.860]   At twit.tv/live.
[02:13:18.860 --> 02:13:20.380]   We have audio and video live streams.
[02:13:20.380 --> 02:13:23.460]   If you do that, irc.twit.tv.
[02:13:23.460 --> 02:13:27.860]   You could join in with the kids in the back of the room as they talk about the show.
[02:13:27.860 --> 02:13:29.220]   Let's see, what else?
[02:13:29.220 --> 02:13:33.660]   If you don't get here on time Sunday afternoon, we have on-demand versions.
[02:13:33.660 --> 02:13:35.540]   You can always have everything we do.
[02:13:35.540 --> 02:13:38.500]   Really, that's what a podcast is, is on-demand.
[02:13:38.500 --> 02:13:44.140]   Audio and video available at our website, twit.tv, or subscribe in your favorite podcast
[02:13:44.140 --> 02:13:45.140]   application.
[02:13:45.140 --> 02:13:46.980]   We don't have an official twit app.
[02:13:46.980 --> 02:13:52.100]   There are a few unofficial and very good twit apps on all platforms, Android, iOS, even
[02:13:52.100 --> 02:13:53.100]   Apple TV.
[02:13:53.100 --> 02:13:54.100]   There's a very good one.
[02:13:54.100 --> 02:13:56.100]   Actually, there's three or four very good ones.
[02:13:56.100 --> 02:13:58.100]   Wrong extension.
[02:13:58.100 --> 02:14:01.900]   But you can always just use whatever podcast application and subscribe that way.
[02:14:01.900 --> 02:14:04.980]   You'll get it the minute it's available Sunday evening.
[02:14:04.980 --> 02:14:05.980]   Thanks for being here.
[02:14:05.980 --> 02:14:07.300]   Good to see you all.
[02:14:07.300 --> 02:14:08.300]   Good fun.
[02:14:08.300 --> 02:14:09.300]   Good to see you.
[02:14:09.300 --> 02:14:10.300]   Another twit.
[02:14:10.300 --> 02:14:11.300]   It is amazing.
[02:14:11.300 --> 02:14:12.300]   [applause]
[02:14:12.300 --> 02:14:12.300]   [music]
[02:14:12.300 --> 02:14:19.300]   [music]
[02:14:19.300 --> 02:14:21.420]   All right, doing the twit.
